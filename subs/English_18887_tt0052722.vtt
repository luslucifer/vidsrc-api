1
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.738
Come in, Mrs. Sugrue.

2
00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:49.336
Katie, darlin'.

3
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:52.989
Can you lend me the loan
of a small pinch of tea?


4
00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:54.680
I'll pay you back Thursday.

5
00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:55.919
You can have it and welcome.

6
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.888
I knew you wouldn't refuse old Sheelah,

7
00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:00.321
and I knew you'd have
rations and leavings,


8
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.360
for there's little that's lacking here,

9
00:02:03.426 --> 00:02:06.021
unless 'twould be a man to cook for.

10
00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:07.826
I have me father to cook for.

11
00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:12.227
So you do, so you do,
but I meant a man of your own.


12
00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:16.230
- Time enough for that.
- "Time enough" lost the ducks.


13
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:20.937
There's many a lass that lost
her market from waiting too long.


14
00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:25.314
You can smile now,
but who in this town would have you?


15
00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:28.510
- Am I that bad?
- You miss the meaning.


16
00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.419
There's not a man doesn't want you,

17
00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.322
but who among them dare look at you

18
00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:37.210
with the grand house you live in?

19
00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:40.754
A fine situation your father has
with his lordship.


20
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:44.267
Take my son Pony.
He don't dare raise his eyes to you,


21
00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.633
and him the catch of the town.

22
00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:49.867
Now, I would have said that Pony
thought no small beer of himself.


23
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.503
He's proud.
He's proud as a white-washed pig,


24
00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.740
but he needs encouragement from you.

25
00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.580
You should be looking ahead, Katie.

26
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.888
Your father is getting no younger,

27
00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:10.984
and when the time comes
that he must step down...


28
00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:18.299
who else will there be but Pony
Sugrue who can take his place?


29
00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.303
Don't put me father
in his grave just yet.


30
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.862
The saints forbid.

31
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.965
He'll be spared for many years,
God willin'.


32
00:03:26.243 --> 00:03:29.007
That must be Pony now.

33
00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.746
No, it's not.

34
00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:36.115
Merciful heavens!
It's Lord Fitzpatrick himself.


35
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.188
Hello, Katie.

36
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.422
Your Lordship, why didn't you
tell us you were coming?


37
00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:48.590
I'd have opened the manor house for you.

38
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.657
I'll not be stopping here
long enough for that.


39
00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:53.328
Where's your father?

40
00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:56.862
Well, now, let me see...

41
00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:59.171
I heard him sayin', something about

42
00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:01.473
cuttin' the weeds
around the summer house.


43
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:04.639
I think he'll have gone to have
the smithy sharpen his scythe.


44
00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:09.378
- I'll fetch him for you, Your Lordship.
- Well, that's good of you.


45
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:18.451
That Katie's a grand girl.
Almost makes up for her father.


46
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.497
- What ails him?
- Nothing at all,


47
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:23.999
but he retired about five years ago,
didn't tell me about it.


48
00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:26.901
He'll be down at the inn now,
telling stories.


49
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.495
Well, let's go
and have a look at the gatehouse.


50
00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.706
I didn't know anybody was here.

51
00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.714
I'm the Widow Sugrue, 
Your Lordship.

52
00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.444
- I often comes in to help.
- I see.


53
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.580
Begging Your Lordship's pardon,
I'm the mother of Pony Sugrue.


54
00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.716
He drives the mail cart to Cahersiveen

55
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.729
whenever the train comes in.

56
00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.759
I'm very glad to hear it.

57
00:04:52.796 --> 00:04:56.253
He's a fine strong lad.
He's worthy of greater things.


58
00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.596
- Is he, now?
- Aye, he is indeed.


59
00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:01.661
You'll never hear me speak a word
against Darby O'Gill,


60
00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:04.071
but he's gettin' on.

61
00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:07.372
When the time comes
for you to hire a younger man,


62
00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:09.776
give a thought to m'lad Pony.

63
00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:12.440
I'm not sure I want a man
who is too well known to the town.


64
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:14.527
A man from outside
would be more respected.


65
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:17.281
My Pony is respected and feared, too.

66
00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:19.915
He's whipped every man in the parish.

67
00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:23.773
Is that so?
Thank you. Thank you.


68
00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:27.423
If it were Pony you had
in charge of this place,


69
00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:30.365
he wouldn't let it
fall to wrack and ruin

70
00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.772
whilst he sat in the pub telling stories.

71
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:38.308
Well, I'll tell you, the first look
I got at him was in the old ruins


72
00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:42.159
- on the top of Knocknasheega.
- And what did he look like, Darby?


73
00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:45.943
Just like any other leprechaun,
only he, being king of them all,


74
00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:48.416
had a little gold crown on his head.

75
00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:50.111
Tell me something, Darby.

76
00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:53.122
Did he have a long tail
and a cloven hoof?


77
00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:56.489
Now, whoever heard
of a leprechaun havin' a...


78
00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:00.595
You don't have to listen
if you don't want to, Pony,


79
00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:02.655
but you needn't make
fun of those who do.

80
00:06:02.732 --> 00:06:05.031
But I do.
I want to listen.


81
00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:06.797
I want to learn all about them.

82
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.497
Here, Molly, give me another large one,

83
00:06:08.572 --> 00:06:11.063
and then maybe I can
see a leprechaun, too.


84
00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:12.870
You'll get no more whiskey here today,

85
00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:17.971
but if you care to be sociable,
you can have a glass of stout.


86
00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:19.247
I ordered whiskey,

87
00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:21.684
and devil a foot will I stir
from here until I get it.


88
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:25.745
Pony Sugrue, you're bloom old
and for want of a beatin',


89
00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:28.815
and if I were 10 years younger,
I'd give it to you.


90
00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:32.487
But you're... you're not

91
00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.262
No, I'm not, but this is my place,

92
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:38.165
and while you're in the Rathcullen
Arms, you'll sit quietly,


93
00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:42.001
or I'll have Father Murphy forbid you
to come here at all.


94
00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:47.275
All right, I'll have the stout.

95
00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:54.241
You were sayin', Darby?

96
00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:58.721
I was sayin' this wasn't
like any old leprechaun


97
00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.654
that you wouldn't say hello twice to.

98
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.626
But who was he...

99
00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:09.428
but Brian Connors himself,
the king of them all.


100
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.233
But I got me eye fixed on him.
They can't escape, you know,


101
00:07:14.304 --> 00:07:18.012
as long as you don't look away.

102
00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:20.700
Now, the night was dark

103
00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.338
and the mountain was covered with mist,

104
00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:30.946
and the moon was no bigger than
the light from a wee penny candle,


105
00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:35.017
but it didn't hide him from me...

106
00:07:36.693 --> 00:07:40.652
for there he stood,
with an angry little gob on him


107
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.221
and his face as fierce as fire.

108
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.269
King Brian, me old boyo,
I've got you at last,


109
00:07:46.336 --> 00:07:47.667
and I'm not gonna let you go

110
00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:50.103
until you grant me the favor
of three grand wishes.


111
00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:52.836
Wait now, wait now,
maybe we can talk this over.


112
00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:56.810
- Will you have a pinch of snuff?
- Aye, and you'll blow it into me eyes.


113
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.848
I'm up to all your dirty little tricks.

114
00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:02.214
You've gone too far. You'll get
no wishes from me at all, now.


115
00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.927
You'll either give them to me,
or else you'll answer to the Church.


116
00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:07.446
I'll have Father Murphy
curse you with a blessin'


117
00:08:07.524 --> 00:08:09.082
that'll shrivel you up in a minute.

118
00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:12.094
All right, then, wish your wishes
and be done with it.


119
00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:13.490
I've work to do at home.

120
00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:17.159
- Don't rush me.
- Don't rush you?


121
00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:19.361
Mean to say you're not gonna wish
for a crock of gold?


122
00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:22.893
I may in due time,
but what's gold to a man


123
00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:27.068
if he be too sick
or too sad to enjoy it?

124
00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:29.408
You're the thinkin' man.

125
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.074
I am, and me first wish
is you'll grant me health.


126
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.175
- Granted.
- Now, me second wish is


127
00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:40.553
a small wish indeed,
but it means a lot to me.


128
00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:44.082
- I want a big crop of potatoes.
- Granted.


129
00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:48.154
And me third wish
is for the crock of gold.


130
00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:51.397
Granted.

131
00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:14.520
Now, what about your fourth wish?

132
00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:16.183
Me fourth wish?

133
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.159
Try me.
You'll find I'm a generous man.


134
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.198
Then I'll be a generous man.

135
00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:26.498
I'd like a crock of gold like this
for me good friend Tom Kerrigan


136
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.438
and another one for
that decent man Pat Scanlon


137
00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:36.105
and another one for that
doorful of a woman, Molly Malloy.


138
00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:38.909
- Is that your fourth wish?
- It is.


139
00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:50.254
Three wishes I'll grant you,
great wishes or small,


140
00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:53.922
but you'll wish a fourth one,
and you'll lose them all!


141
00:10:10.347 --> 00:10:14.306
Wasn't I the fool of the world, lettin'
him trick me into the fourth wish,


142
00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:16.477
and me knowin' better.

143
00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:20.886
Dear, dear, and we could all
have been as rich as Midas himself.


144
00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.085
- A whole crock of gold for me.
- The devil's gold.


145
00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:27.688
I wouldn't touch it if Father Murphy
blessed every coin.


146
00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:30.096
Stay away from Knocknasheega, Darby.

147
00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.964
You moil and meddle
with that little king,


148
00:10:32.035 --> 00:10:35.435
he'll put the come-hither on you
and make you his slave forevermore.


149
00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:37.904
Do you think I'm a babe in arms?

150
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:41.900
You are to the likes of him.

151
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:44.709
and every year of his life
he's learned a new trick.


152
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:47.281
And I've learned 100 of them.

153
00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:51.913
You're mad, mind you. You'll be
caught like a rat in a snap trap.


154
00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:53.957
Now, I don't want
your blood on my head,

155
00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:56.492
so don't wish any gold for me.

156
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.087
I'll leave your share
to the Church, Paddy,


157
00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:03.655
but I won't let Father Murphy
know where I got it.


158
00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:07.170
No, no.

159
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.475
God save all here.

160
00:11:15.512 --> 00:11:17.742
We didn't see you, Father.

161
00:11:17.814 --> 00:11:21.773
I didn't want to interrupt.
I just dropped in to tell you the news.


162
00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:24.286
My friend Father O'Leary
in the town of Glencove


163
00:11:24.354 --> 00:11:27.380
has a new bell that was given to him
by Lord Bellinbergh,


164
00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:30.255
and he has presented
the old one to us.

165
00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:32.852
- That's grand, Father.
- Glory be.


166
00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:34.988
There'll be a chapel bell
in our tower at last.


167
00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:36.896
All we have to do
is to go after it.

168
00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:42.005
Now, if I had a horse, which I haven't,
I'd go for it myself, which I won't,


169
00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.996
but I thought perhaps there might
be somebody here


170
00:11:45.075 --> 00:11:49.429
with a horse and cart
who'd like to go for the bell.


171
00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:52.178
How much would that somebody
be paid, Father?


172
00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:54.114
Paid?

173
00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:57.516
I suppose we might be able
to scratch up two pounds.


174
00:11:57.587 --> 00:12:00.784
Now, I would've said it was
worth two pounds, 10,


175
00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:01.924
if it was worth a bob.

176
00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:06.055
Like enough it's worth three pounds,
but since we're a poor parish,


177
00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:08.654
I thought perhaps you might like to
take out the difference


178
00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:12.189
in the credit to your soul.

179
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:16.008
Two pounds, 10, Father.

180
00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.875
Why, my goodness me,

181
00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:21.570
a deed like that
might even absolve a man

182
00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:25.376
from the sin of using
the priest and the Church


183
00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:30.944
against the powers of darkness
for his own selfish ends.


184
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.512
I'll do it, Father.

185
00:12:34.078 --> 00:12:36.388
I'll do it for nothing.

186
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.523
No. As a reward, you may have
the music of the bell.


187
00:12:41.598 --> 00:12:44.726
- The music of the bell for me?
- Yes,


188
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.736
and for your seed, breed and
generation till the end of time.


189
00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:52.709
It's a bargain, Father.
I'll do it in the morning.


190
00:12:52.943 --> 00:12:54.740
Father!

191
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.390
Savin' your presence, Father Murphy,
but he's needed at the house.


192
00:12:57.414 --> 00:12:58.379
Excuse me, Your Reverence.

193
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.248
- Fitzpatrick himself...
- Don't worry about me, girl.


194
00:13:01.318 --> 00:13:03.581
I'll get back.
I'm coming now.


195
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:05.484
What are you after doin' pulling me out,

196
00:13:05.555 --> 00:13:07.681
with Father Murphy
lookin' at us, neither?


197
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.691
I can't afford an army of caretakers
for the little use I have of the place,


198
00:13:12.762 --> 00:13:16.699
but I don't like to see the weeds
higher than the summer house.


199
00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:18.530
Someone's after poaching rabbits.

200
00:13:18.602 --> 00:13:21.969
That's a thing
I want you to put a stop to.


201
00:13:22.037 --> 00:13:25.030
Old Darby couldn't catch
a poacher if he tried.


202
00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:27.701
Like enough he helped to set the snare.

203
00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:31.578
Now, I don't want any bad feeling
between the townspeople and me.


204
00:13:31.648 --> 00:13:34.147
I like 'em, mind
you, and so will you,

205
00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:37.847
- but don't like 'em too much.
- No, sir. No poachers.


206
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:39.353
Well, well, well, sir.

207
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:42.483
I never thought I'd have the pleasure
of seeing Your Lordship so soon.


208
00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:44.959
Yes, it looks as if you weren't
quite ready for me.


209
00:13:45.028 --> 00:13:47.360
One more day, and I'll have
the whole place beautified.


210
00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:52.060
Darby, this is Michael MacBride,
a Dublin man.


211
00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:55.866
I've decided to settle him here
in your place.


212
00:13:56.202 --> 00:14:00.000
I know it sounds sudden,
but I've had it in mind for some time.


213
00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:04.240
You've served me well, Darby,
but we need a younger man here.


214
00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:07.909
When a man gets along in years,
he shouldn't have to work so hard,


215
00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:12.318
so I'm going to retire you on half pay,
let you have the old McCarthy cottage


216
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:14.448
rent-free for the rest of your days.

217
00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:18.307
And leave the gatehouse?
It's become our home.


218
00:14:18.344 --> 00:14:20.453
Well, so will the other in time.

219
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:25.593
- I don't think Katie will take to this.
- We'll give it a new thatch.


220
00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:29.696
But what am I going to do with
myself, and me cut off in me prime?


221
00:14:29.773 --> 00:14:32.400
You'll be telling stories
at the public house all day,


222
00:14:33.103 --> 00:14:34.340
and poaching rabbits by night.

223
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.538
Holy old Finbar!

224
00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:38.773
What with the foxes eatin' the grouse,

225
00:14:38.849 --> 00:14:42.512
don't tell me I set a snare
down a rabbit hole.


226
00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:44.485
You're an old fox yourself, Darby,

227
00:14:44.554 --> 00:14:47.237
but, faith, I'm fond of you
and Katie, too.


228
00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:49.920
Whenever we have to
open up the manor house,


229
00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:51.404
she can have first call
with the cleaning.


230
00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:54.573
Pardon me, sir, but when have
we got to leave the gatehouse?


231
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.957
Can we give them another two weeks?

232
00:14:57.032 --> 00:14:58.967
Longer than that, sir,
as far as I'm concerned.


233
00:14:59.034 --> 00:15:01.047
Good. Then tonight, when you
finish today's work here,


234
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:04.006
you tell Tom Kerrigan to let you have
a room at the Rathcullen Arms.


235
00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:07.388
Please, sir, I'd be grateful if you
wouldn't mention it to Katie.


236
00:15:07.424 --> 00:15:10.140
I want to break
the news to her myself.

237
00:15:10.213 --> 00:15:14.843
Very well, but remember I said two
weeks, Darby, not two years.


238
00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:18.910
When I return here on Monday week,
I want you out and Michael in


239
00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:21.685
and everything settled and done.

240
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:26.886
Yes, sir.

241
00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:31.195
Good day, Your Lordship!

242
00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:34.932
Well, goodbye, Mr. O'Gill.

243
00:15:35.343 --> 00:15:36.949
Now here, wouldn't it be a shame
to put his lordship


244
00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:38.317
to the expense of
a room in the pub

245
00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:41.674
and Katie and me fair rockin'
around in the gatehouse?


246
00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:45.010
That's very kind of you, but I don't
think his lordship would like it.


247
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.743
Why wouldn't he? Sure I can instruct
you on your new duties. Katie!


248
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.376
Yes, Father?

249
00:15:50.452 --> 00:15:53.047
- This is Mister...
- MacBride.


250
00:15:53.123 --> 00:15:55.182
Mr. MacBride is comin'
to stay with us for a while,


251
00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:57.351
so throw some extra spuds
in the pot for supper


252
00:15:57.427 --> 00:15:59.520
and make up the bed in the loft.

253
00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.360
If it's any trouble, 
I can go to the inn.

254
00:16:02.432 --> 00:16:05.333
It's no trouble at all.

255
00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:19.079
Pony!

256
00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:20.426
- Come with me.
- What's up with you now?


257
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.544
I want you outside where his lordship
can have a look at you.


258
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.985
Why should he want a look at me?

259
00:16:25.393 --> 00:16:27.153
'Cause you're going to be
a consequential man


260
00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:30.183
and have Darby's fine position
as his lordship's caretaker


261
00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:31.989
and Katie O'Gill for your wife.

262
00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:35.224
And when the sky falls,
we'll all catch larks.


263
00:16:35.297 --> 00:16:37.892
I mean it, Pony. I had a talk with
his lordship about you,


264
00:16:37.968 --> 00:16:39.959
and I tell you
it's only a matter of time.


265
00:16:40.036 --> 00:16:42.470
I put a flea in Katie's ear, too.

266
00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:46.737
I wouldn't worry about her.
With a fine situation like that,


267
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.308
I could have me choice of girls.

268
00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:51.808
Katie might help you get it.

269
00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:56.147
- Maybe you're right.
- Here he comes.


270
00:16:59.054 --> 00:17:01.887
Smile, me darling.
Smile.


271
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:09.030
This is m'lad Pony, Your Lordship,
the one I told you about.


272
00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.232
Your servant, sir.

273
00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:13.600
Well, he's a big man, isn't he, now?

274
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.798
Nice to meet you, Pony.

275
00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:19.807
"A big man," says he.
What did I tell you?


276
00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:22.868
You'll get the job
in no time at all.

277
00:17:29.252 --> 00:17:34.053
Katie, you should have saw the
turf the two of us cut this afternoon.


278
00:17:34.124 --> 00:17:37.569
That was a grand bit of work you
done. So it was, aye.


279
00:17:37.605 --> 00:17:38.761
His lordship thought I could use a lad

280
00:17:38.762 --> 00:17:41.526
to help with the turf
before the rains came.


281
00:17:41.598 --> 00:17:43.896
And me doin' 10 men's work already.

282
00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:48.502
Come, lad, sit down.
Take the air of the fire,


283
00:17:48.538 --> 00:17:52.406
and I'll play you a tune
while the pot's on the boil.


284
00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:56.375
That's good.

285
00:18:03.153 --> 00:18:08.216
- Can you put a name to that?
- No, it's... it's new to me.


286
00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:09.855
What's it called?

287
00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:13.053
Them as I heard it
from give it no name.

288
00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:15.323
Well, where did you hear it?

289
00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:24.137
In the old ruins
on the top of Knocknasheega,


290
00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:28.906
and there were the little people
dancing all around in the moonlight.


291
00:18:28.978 --> 00:18:32.106
Well, aren't they the bold creatures?

292
00:18:32.182 --> 00:18:35.811
Aye, they are.

293
00:18:35.885 --> 00:18:38.319
Supper's ready.

294
00:18:38.388 --> 00:18:41.323
Bold and cunning, they are,
but I'm up to them.


295
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:43.689
Once I caught King Brian himself,

296
00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:47.856
and he gave me the gold,
though I'd no need for it.


297
00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:53.194
But, faith, I have need for it now.

298
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:56.731
Don't breathe a word.

299
00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:03.456
Tomorrow at dawn I've got
to go to Glencove


300
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.643
to bring back a bell for the chapel.
I'll have to round up the horse, now,


301
00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:09.878
before she runs all over
the mountainside.


302
00:19:09.953 --> 00:19:11.250
I'll be glad to give you a hand.

303
00:19:11.321 --> 00:19:14.222
I was just going to ask you to go
the rounds of the manor house


304
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.588
and try all the doors and the windows.

305
00:19:16.659 --> 00:19:19.958
Right so, but after that, I think I'll go
down to the Rathcullen Arms


306
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:22.497
and see about a room.

307
00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:24.999
Now, why would you be doin' that?

308
00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:27.213
I don't like to take hospitality
under false pretenses,


309
00:19:27.237 --> 00:19:29.899
and besides, two weeks from today,
you must leave here.


310
00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:32.533
- I think your daughter should know.
- She will, she will.


311
00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:34.769
Then why let her believe
that I was brought here


312
00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:36.178
only for the cuttin' of the turf?

313
00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:37.770
You see, she was born in the gatehouse,

314
00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:39.948
and for 20 years, she's lived in it.

315
00:19:39.984 --> 00:19:42.050
It gives us a standin' in the town.

316
00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:44.348
No, I'll tell her when the time comes.

317
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.481
I can't break it out of a clear sky
like a crack of thunder.


318
00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:51.288
Well, when will you tell her?

319
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:53.556
- The first good chance I get.
- Then do it soon.


320
00:19:54.268 --> 00:19:57.589
I'll tell her, I'll tell her.
Here, I'm used to the dark.


321
00:20:01.037 --> 00:20:04.097
- Watch out for poachers.
- I'll do that.


322
00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.614
Come on now, Cleopatra.

323
00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:22.920
Wait now, darlin'.

324
00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:26.052
Devil take you!
Come back here!


325
00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:29.656
Come back to your master.
Wait till I catch you.


326
00:20:29.732 --> 00:20:31.791
Cleopatra, come on, now.

327
00:20:33.836 --> 00:20:36.270
Cleopatra, where are you?

328
00:20:36.592 --> 00:20:38.636
I'm lookin' for you.
Can't you hear me?


329
00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:40.706
Cleopatra.

330
00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:03.125
There you are.
What do you think you're doin'?


331
00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:05.463
Hop out of that.
Do you want to break a leg?


332
00:21:08.504 --> 00:21:12.406
There.
I tell you.


333
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.218
There.

334
00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:30.417
Get down!

335
00:21:30.492 --> 00:21:32.461
Get down!

336
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:53.270
- So that's Darby O'Gill, is it?
- Aye, it is.


337
00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:56.984
I wonder why his honor put the
come-hither on the likes of that.


338
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.619
Sure there's no more life in him
than a potato vine after a frost.


339
00:22:00.689 --> 00:22:04.057
Well, either he's hard asleep
or he's killed entirely.


340
00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:06.118
Let's find out.

341
00:22:15.104 --> 00:22:16.765
You murderin' little heathens!

342
00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:20.707
- Watch your stick.
- Hey! Get off me!


343
00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:22.267
Wait, wait.
Hey!


344
00:22:33.556 --> 00:22:37.048
Come on, you blackguard,
now we'll take you to the king.


345
00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:38.991
There's no tellin' what he'll do to you.

346
00:22:39.062 --> 00:22:42.657
No tellin' indeed.

347
00:22:46.536 --> 00:22:48.663
- Come on.
- Hurry up!


348
00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:36.516
Darby O'Gill is here.
He's come.


349
00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:48.287
Come in, man.
Come in.


350
00:23:48.364 --> 00:23:52.225
All right, Your Royal Highness.

351
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.061
Well, Darby O'Gill, 'tis pleased
and delighted I am to see you again.


352
00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:30.833
Thank you, sir.
It's a grand place you got here.


353
00:24:30.907 --> 00:24:33.670
It does well enough.
Sit down, man.


354
00:24:35.967 --> 00:24:37.169
Over there.

355
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.219
Drop the lid, man.

356
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.416
It's only an old chest full of jewels.

357
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:52.086
We took it from the Spanish ships
when the Armada


358
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:54.788
- was wrecked on our coast.
- Is that so?


359
00:24:54.864 --> 00:24:57.697
Ship's gun, too.

360
00:24:57.766 --> 00:25:00.292
That's a fine piece.

361
00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:03.133
- It is indeed.
- And the throne?


362
00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:08.109
By all the goats in Kerry, do you
think I'd sit on a Spanish throne?


363
00:25:08.177 --> 00:25:10.475
This once belonged to Fergus mac Leda,

364
00:25:10.856 --> 00:25:13.276
ancient high king of all Ireland.

365
00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:15.874
- Do you say so?
- I do.


366
00:25:15.952 --> 00:25:20.020
And over there, the gold cup of Cormac.

367
00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:24.549
And here's the sword of Brian Boru,
who drove out the Danes.


368
00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:27.518
And over there you see the harp.

369
00:25:28.258 --> 00:25:30.209
Don't tell me it's "the harp
that once through Tara's Hall"


370
00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:32.667
the soul of music shed."

371
00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:35.151
Aye, it is that same.

372
00:25:35.318 --> 00:25:37.767
I declare to me soul, when I
tell them this down in the pub,


373
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.205
they won't believe a word of it.

374
00:25:39.275 --> 00:25:41.505
You can't do that, Darby.

375
00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:44.876
Once you're here, there's no going back.

376
00:25:45.915 --> 00:25:47.507
I've got to get back to Katie.

377
00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:49.414
You needn't worry about Katie.

378
00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:52.181
She'll give you a grand wake,
and then she'll forget all about you.


379
00:25:52.668 --> 00:25:56.351
- Mind what you say about Katie.
- Calm yourself, now. Calm yourself!


380
00:25:56.735 --> 00:25:59.155
- What have I ever done to you?
- Nothin', Darby.


381
00:25:59.228 --> 00:26:02.129
- Who tells all the stories about you?
- You do, Darby.


382
00:26:02.198 --> 00:26:04.222
Aye, and who makes the women watch

383
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.744
where they're throwin' their wash water

384
00:26:05.768 --> 00:26:07.998
when you and your lads
are out walkin' invisible?


385
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.593
You do, Darby.

386
00:26:09.672 --> 00:26:12.834
And who makes the men
tip their hats respectful


387
00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.070
to every swirl of dust?

388
00:26:14.076 --> 00:26:17.011
You.
You've done grand.


389
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.910
So you put the come-hither on me.

390
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:22.883
That's how you pay me back,
you ungrateful little frainey.


391
00:26:22.952 --> 00:26:25.887
Your heart's as cold as a wet Christmas.

392
00:26:30.593 --> 00:26:32.720
Blackguard!

393
00:26:32.795 --> 00:26:35.593
They better watch what they're
saying. I speak Gaelic, too.


394
00:26:35.664 --> 00:26:38.031
- Now, you listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.


395
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.069
Phadrig Oge was standing under
the white thorn tree


396
00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:43.605
by the summer house when his
lordship gave you


397
00:26:43.672 --> 00:26:47.150
the bad news today, and the moment
I heard you were in trouble,


398
00:26:47.186 --> 00:26:48.440
I swore I'd take you out of it.

399
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:50.776
If you're the fine, decent man
I think you are,


400
00:26:50.813 --> 00:26:53.043
you'll be showin' me
a little bit of gratitude.


401
00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:55.447
I am grateful.

402
00:26:55.518 --> 00:26:57.429
Then you can say goodbye to
the tears and the troubles


403
00:26:57.453 --> 00:27:02.049
of the world outside. There's nothin'
but fun and diversion here.


404
00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:04.488
Now, what'll you do first, Darby?

405
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.223
- Well, I don't know.
- Would you care to play the harp?


406
00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:12.063
No, I'm no great hand with the harp...

407
00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:15.228
but give me me old fiddle,
and I'll play you a tune


408
00:27:15.304 --> 00:27:17.397
- worth goin' a mile o' ground to hear.
- Grand.


409
00:27:17.473 --> 00:27:22.240
Now, if someone will show me
the way out, I'll go home for it.


410
00:27:22.311 --> 00:27:24.779
None of your tricks, Darby.

411
00:27:24.847 --> 00:27:27.680
I said you were here to stay.

412
00:27:29.351 --> 00:27:30.979
Phadrig Oge!

413
00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:34.283
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Fetch the Stradivarius.


414
00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:36.689
Right away, Your Highness.

415
00:27:43.532 --> 00:27:48.526
It was presented to me by the
emperor of the Italian fairies in 1700.


416
00:27:48.604 --> 00:27:51.004
It's a Stradivarius.

417
00:27:51.073 --> 00:27:52.506
I'd rather have me own.

418
00:27:52.575 --> 00:27:55.009
You'll have to make do with this one.

419
00:27:55.077 --> 00:27:56.177
Go ahead, man.
Try it.


420
00:27:56.178 --> 00:27:58.976
All right, then, if it makes you happy.

421
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.087
- Now give us a good one.
- All right, then.


422
00:28:15.718 --> 00:28:17.542
Me grandfather Podge told me
there were three things.


423
00:28:17.566 --> 00:28:23.198
Dancin', whiskey and huntin'.

424
00:28:23.272 --> 00:28:25.206
Begorra!
He wasn't far wrong.


425
00:28:25.274 --> 00:28:27.834
Then I'll give you the fox chase.

426
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.003
The fox chase.

427
00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:33.071
First you'll hear
the gathering of the huntsmen


428
00:28:33.148 --> 00:28:35.549
- and the bayin' of the hounds.
- Grand.


429
00:28:35.618 --> 00:28:38.347
Away we go.

430
00:31:12.842 --> 00:31:14.833
Gone away!

431
00:31:41.437 --> 00:31:42.734
Give us full cry!

432
00:32:07.563 --> 00:32:10.396
A- ridling!

433
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.567
Oscul!

434
00:32:43.232 --> 00:32:44.699
A- ridling!

435
00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:25.536
Wait!
Wait, Your Highness. Wait!


436
00:33:54.236 --> 00:33:56.966
Whose side are you on, anyway?

437
00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:06.109
You'll find out who's
the knowledgeable one.


438
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.274
Come on, now.

439
00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:36.507
It's not for me.
I'm expectin' company.


440
00:34:43.552 --> 00:34:46.112
If I can only hold him here
till cockcrow,


441
00:34:46.817 --> 00:34:50.625
you'll see what'll happen to your
friend when daylight comes. Aye.


442
00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:04.798
And... And how was the chase?

443
00:35:04.873 --> 00:35:08.866
We were chasin' the wrong fox,
but I've run you to earth at last.


444
00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:10.434
What do you mean, sir?

445
00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:14.678
- I've a good mind to break your back!
- I thought we were friends.


446
00:35:14.715 --> 00:35:17.875
You've made a laughingstock of me
in front of my own people!


447
00:35:17.953 --> 00:35:20.820
- I don't understand.
- When his lordship kicked you out,


448
00:35:20.889 --> 00:35:22.379
- who took you in?
- You did.


449
00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:24.983
And what did you do the minute
my back was turned?


450
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.496
I
-I just went back for me pipe.

451
00:35:28.564 --> 00:35:30.828
You didn't think I wanted
to stay here, did you?


452
00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:34.994
How could any man who's had one
look inside the fairy mountain


453
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.061
be content with anything else?

454
00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:40.302
Faith, I never saw dancin' so fine

455
00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:43.401
or heard pipin' so shockin' sweet

456
00:35:43.582 --> 00:35:47.415
or touched a fiddle so grand,
and never in me wildest dreams


457
00:35:47.783 --> 00:35:51.412
did I dream I'd be sittin' on diamonds.

458
00:35:51.487 --> 00:35:54.752
No, indeed.
All I want from here is me old duidin.


459
00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:58.054
Well, you better make sure. We
can't have you goin' in and out.


460
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.891
No, not a thing else.

461
00:36:00.963 --> 00:36:04.262
- I'll not even be needin' this.
- And what might that be, now?


462
00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:07.791
It's a drop of old poteen
I found in the bog.


463
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.964
It has a real smack to it.
I'd offer you a drop,


464
00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:13.530
only it wouldn't be fine enough
for Your Royal Highness.


465
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:15.042
Let me be the judge of that.

466
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:18.477
Well, very good, 
Your Royal Highness.

467
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.796
Well, here goes.

468
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:05.482
It drinks cool and easy, so it does.

469
00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:09.258
I'm plenty glad you like it.
Now we'd better be on our way.


470
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:13.289
I can't wait to get back to all that
music and fun and diversion.


471
00:37:13.368 --> 00:37:15.734
Now, just a minute.

472
00:37:17.973 --> 00:37:20.066
We've a fine bit of diversion right here.

473
00:37:20.142 --> 00:37:24.373
Sit down now and have one with me
for friendship's sake.


474
00:37:24.446 --> 00:37:28.610
Well, if you insist,
Your Royal Highness...


475
00:37:28.684 --> 00:37:32.711
- I'll join you.
- Good man, yourself,


476
00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:35.017
and if it's music you're after,
what about a song?


477
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:36.524
- A song?
- Aye.


478
00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:38.959
- Do you know the "Wishing Song"?
- I do not.


479
00:37:39.027 --> 00:37:43.546
We better not try it, then.
You have to make it up as you go.

00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:46.434

thousand songs, so I can.

Can you?

482
00:37:48.036 --> 00:37:51.220

Try again.

- Hoo, hullabaloo!


533
00:42:15.637 --> 00:42:19.403
Good mornin', Ginger.
Have you come for your breakfast?


534
00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:22.671
Well, there's a tasty morsel
I've no further use for.


535
00:42:23.645 --> 00:42:27.496
Don't let him loose.
Don't let him loose!


536
00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:34.786
Shrivel him up.
Put a hump in his back.


537
00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:36.055
Have mercy, Darby.

538
00:42:36.057 --> 00:42:39.424
Spare me and I'll grant you your
three wishes all over again!


539
00:42:39.494 --> 00:42:41.484
Do you hear that, Ginger?

540
00:42:43.575 --> 00:42:44.097
Now, go on, wish them.

541
00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:47.416
Sure now, I might wish
for the crock of gold.


542
00:42:47.453 --> 00:42:50.735
- Go on!
- Or I might wish for... let's see...


543
00:42:50.805 --> 00:42:52.432
- Long life.
- Yes.


544
00:42:52.507 --> 00:42:56.341
Or I might wish
for a carriage and pair.

545
00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:58.902
Granted. Granted.

546
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.345
Granted!

547
00:43:00.884 --> 00:43:04.012
But I haven't wished a wish yet.
I said I might.


548
00:43:04.049 --> 00:43:07.213
Get on with it, then.
Wish your wishes,


549
00:43:07.289 --> 00:43:10.019
and since we've had
such a grand night of it,


550
00:43:10.091 --> 00:43:11.785
you can have as many as you like.

551
00:43:12.103 --> 00:43:13.588
So that's good of you.

552
00:43:13.661 --> 00:43:17.154
"Three wishes I'll grant you,
big wishes and small,


553
00:43:17.232 --> 00:43:20.167
but if you wish a fourth,
you'll get none at all."


554
00:43:22.082 --> 00:43:25.637
What a memory you've got,
you wicked old scut.


555
00:43:28.076 --> 00:43:30.977
But before I make a wish,
I'll have to talk with Katie.


556
00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:33.037
- I'll make one.
- Go on, go on.


557
00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:35.241
One wish to protect the other two.

558
00:43:35.316 --> 00:43:39.583
Now, me first wish is that you will
not fly back to Knocknasheega,


559
00:43:39.654 --> 00:43:43.556
but you'll be at my beck and call
for a fortnight at least,


560
00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:45.957
until I make the other two wishes.

561
00:43:46.027 --> 00:43:49.553
You thief of the world.
Never in 1,000 years


562
00:43:49.631 --> 00:43:51.598
has a man taken such an
underhanded advantage.


563
00:43:51.666 --> 00:43:55.397
Faith, never in 5,000 years
have you ever met


564
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.200
a more knowledgeable adversary.

565
00:43:58.273 --> 00:44:01.002
I am Brian of Knocknasheega, and never...

566
00:44:01.075 --> 00:44:02.509
No! No!

567
00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:05.272
Do you agree to the terms
of the first wish?


568
00:44:05.347 --> 00:44:06.678
I do, I do!

569
00:44:06.748 --> 00:44:09.280
All right, then.
Go on, Ginger.


570
00:44:09.317 --> 00:44:12.445
But how am I gonna protect myself
while you're makin' up your mind?


571
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.318
Now, don't worry.

572
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.947
I'll take good care of you.

573
00:44:19.527 --> 00:44:22.189
No, no, no, you wicked old devil.

574
00:44:22.263 --> 00:44:25.426
You murderin' old hypocrite!
Let me go! Let me out!


575
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.331
Let me out, do you hear me?

576
00:44:57.432 --> 00:45:00.059
Now, what would she be doin' around here?

577
00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:02.103
Always scroogin' round to the back door,

578
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.070
beggin' something,
borrowin' tea or something.


579
00:45:07.408 --> 00:45:09.400
- Morning.
- Good morning.


580
00:45:09.477 --> 00:45:12.378
- Did you sleep well?
- That I did, thank you.


581
00:45:12.447 --> 00:45:13.580
Where's Darby?

582
00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:16.879
His bed hasn't been slept in,
but he'll turn up.


583
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:18.562
I gathered from something
he said last night


584
00:45:18.586 --> 00:45:21.986
that he might capture the leprechaun.

585
00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:26.289
- He has great games with them.
- When he's taken a draft too many?


586
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.556
He's not a drinkin' man.

587
00:45:31.399 --> 00:45:34.585
But he's a lonely man
since me mother died.


588
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:37.771
When he goes to the pub,
it's for company,


589
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:40.117
and when he makes his rounds at
night, the wee folk give him sport.


590
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:44.237
Well, what about yourself?
Don't you get lonely?


591
00:45:45.813 --> 00:45:49.180
I keep busy.
Rathcullen's a small, little place,


592
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:53.185
but there are dances
and hostings aplenty.


593
00:45:53.254 --> 00:45:55.620
There's a dance on tonight.

594
00:45:55.657 --> 00:45:58.319
Maybe you'd care to go,
Mr. MacBride?


595
00:45:58.393 --> 00:46:00.452
No, not yet, thank you.

596
00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:03.725
And, by the way, my name is Michael.

597
00:46:03.798 --> 00:46:07.598
Well, so it is, but until I've
known you more than a day,


598
00:46:07.669 --> 00:46:12.697
your name is Mr. MacBride...
Mr. MacBride.


599
00:46:12.774 --> 00:46:16.107
What was old Sheelah doin' around here?

600
00:46:16.177 --> 00:46:18.270
She dropped in
to pay back a pinch of tea.


601
00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:20.280
Well, I don't like to see her
about the place.


602
00:46:20.348 --> 00:46:23.043
- Father, sit down and eat.
- She and her son Pony,


603
00:46:23.117 --> 00:46:24.929
they're two of a kind,
neither of them up to any good.


604
00:46:24.953 --> 00:46:26.614
She's only a poor old woman.

605
00:46:26.688 --> 00:46:30.215
Old woman indeed.
Are you wearin' your holy medal?


606
00:46:30.291 --> 00:46:32.759
- I am.
- Well, don't leave it off.


607
00:46:32.827 --> 00:46:36.660
- She could be a witch.
- You'd better go to bed.


608
00:46:36.731 --> 00:46:42.692
I can't. I got to go to Glencove
to pick up a bell for Father Murphy.


609
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.204
'Tis a shame I'll not
be here today to help you.


610
00:46:48.276 --> 00:46:53.509
We can't let the cutting of the turf
stand in the way of good deeds.


611
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:56.778
Well, me boy, seein' it's for one day
only, could you leave the turf


612
00:46:56.851 --> 00:47:01.185
and cut the weeds
around the summer house?


613
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.280
- I think I could.
- And, listen,


614
00:47:03.752 --> 00:47:06.623
if you make a good job of it,
I might keep you on.


615
00:47:06.694 --> 00:47:08.855
How would you like
workin' for me, anyway?


616
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.090
Why would he want to work for you?

617
00:47:11.165 --> 00:47:13.134
You haven't one shilling
to rub against the other.


618
00:47:14.002 --> 00:47:16.470
Katie, me dear,

619
00:47:16.538 --> 00:47:20.023
there's been a change in our
fortunes for the better.


620
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.509
I'm thinkin' of buyin'
the manor house for myself


621
00:47:23.578 --> 00:47:26.046
and shiftin' you out of here
into surroundin's


622
00:47:26.114 --> 00:47:29.345
more in keepin'
with your charm and beauty.


623
00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:31.657
Well, I wouldn't want to live
in the manor house.


624
00:47:31.988 --> 00:47:33.497
You know as well as I do,
his lordship would never sell it.


625
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:36.046
What do you want?
You've only got to name it.


626
00:47:36.124 --> 00:47:38.114
I don't want anything.
Now, sit down.


627
00:47:38.192 --> 00:47:41.060
I suppose you don't want to hear
about the great battle


628
00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:43.221
I fought with the powers of darkness.

629
00:47:43.298 --> 00:47:46.733
I do not.
Now, sit down and eat your stirabout.


630
00:47:51.406 --> 00:47:53.966
She should be the caretaker.

631
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:57.477
She's got a tongue would clip a hedge.

00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:51.861
but you were makin' so much noise,
you couldn't hear me.


649
00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:55.061
Faith, I know I can't sing a lick,
but when I'm roarin' like Doran's bull,


650
00:48:55.739 --> 00:48:58.405
it works up a killin' hunger in me.
What have we got here?


651
00:48:58.473 --> 00:49:00.440
Bread newly baked,
butter fresh from the churn,


652
00:49:00.508 --> 00:49:01.607
and boiled eggs and ham.

653
00:49:01.608 --> 00:49:04.908
Well, now, aren't you the clever girl?

654
00:49:06.481 --> 00:49:08.573
You have enough here to feed the parish.

655
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.709
I thought you'd be hungry.

656
00:49:10.785 --> 00:49:14.152
- I hope the bread has cooled.
- I like it hot.


657
00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:17.123
Mile murder! Did no one ever
tell you the hazard of hot bread?


658
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.390
No, they didn't...

659
00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:22.762
Sure you can see I need
someone to watch over me.


660
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.424
Did your father say anything
this morning before he left?


661
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.400
He said he would be back by sundown.

662
00:49:27.468 --> 00:49:30.028
Nothin' about me?

663
00:49:30.104 --> 00:49:33.231
- He said you were a good lad.
- That's all?


664
00:49:33.308 --> 00:49:37.438
- Isn't that enough?
- I suppose it is.


665
00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:40.480
Tell me, Katie,
do you think I'm a good lad?


666
00:49:42.317 --> 00:49:44.045
I very greatly doubt it.

667
00:50:29.197 --> 00:50:32.565
Aye, you look fine, Darby!

668
00:50:33.868 --> 00:50:35.994
Hey, all right!

669
00:50:36.465 --> 00:50:39.801
It's a grand bell.
You've done a great deed.


670
00:50:39.874 --> 00:50:42.935
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.


671
00:50:45.213 --> 00:50:47.340
Darby!

672
00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:53.443
- What have you got in the bag?
- Well, Father,


673
00:50:53.521 --> 00:50:55.512
it would be a hard thing to explain.

674
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.490
Now, you could try.

675
00:50:57.557 --> 00:51:01.823
Well, like, it's a kind of financial
venture, you might say.


676
00:51:01.896 --> 00:51:04.990
A financial venture that you'd be
afraid to tell your priest about?


677
00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:08.830
No, no, no.
Sure I'm on the side of the angels,


678
00:51:08.867 --> 00:51:11.603
against the powers of darkness.

679
00:51:11.639 --> 00:51:13.698
What would you say, 
Father, if I told you

680
00:51:13.775 --> 00:51:17.107
I captured the king of the little people?

681
00:51:17.178 --> 00:51:20.841
I'd say you had imagined it.

682
00:51:21.384 --> 00:51:24.578
Then I've nothin' at all
in the bag here, Reverend.


683
00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:27.586
Nothin' at all.

684
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.463
Glory be to the saints of joy.
This is a great day for Rathcullen.


685
00:51:41.536 --> 00:51:44.403
You've certainly earned
a glass of stout, Darby.


686
00:51:44.472 --> 00:51:47.407
Aye, it's dry work cartin' a bell.

687
00:51:47.475 --> 00:51:51.036
May we all live to see...

688
00:51:51.206 --> 00:51:54.445
- Would a toast be a kind of wish?
- It would.


689
00:51:54.514 --> 00:51:58.144
Well, then, devil a toast
will I drink this day.


690
00:52:03.056 --> 00:52:05.617
What's in there?

691
00:52:07.195 --> 00:52:11.632
The renowned Brian Connors,
king of all the leprechauns.


692
00:52:11.698 --> 00:52:13.825
One wish I wished already,

693
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:18.838
but I'm not lettin' him out of this
bag until I've wished the other two.


694
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:21.766
What does he look like, Darby?

695
00:52:21.843 --> 00:52:25.836
Just a teeny-weeny tawny little
atom-y kind of gentleman


696
00:52:25.913 --> 00:52:27.743
with a beard on his face

697
00:52:27.814 --> 00:52:32.582
and a crown like a fistful
of horns on his head.


698
00:52:32.653 --> 00:52:33.720
Let's have a look at him, Darby.

699
00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:36.656
Let's have a look
at the little gentleman.


700
00:52:36.723 --> 00:52:37.922
Never mind, then.

701
00:52:37.991 --> 00:52:40.620
Sure it's only
Lady Fitzpatrick's prize hen,


702
00:52:40.695 --> 00:52:42.959
the one they gave
the red ribbon to at the fair.


703
00:52:52.907 --> 00:52:57.469
Fill the little pannikin, 20 year old,
the best in the house.


704
00:52:57.545 --> 00:53:00.275
I will, Darby.

705
00:53:12.693 --> 00:53:14.888
Thank you.

706
00:53:14.962 --> 00:53:17.054
Here you are, Your Majesty.

707
00:53:59.307 --> 00:54:02.868
- Did you see that?
- I saw it with me own two eyes.


708
00:54:02.944 --> 00:54:05.435
Give me the glass, Tom.

709
00:54:09.584 --> 00:54:12.781
That's a story will bear repeatin'.

710
00:54:15.924 --> 00:54:18.024
And if any man
doubts the truth of it,

711
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:22.586

Well, he said you were
worried about the poachers.


734

If I hurry, I'll catch up with him.

- The devil take you!
- Darby!


736
00:55:36.671 --> 00:55:38.631
What ails you, lad?
Is it blind you are?


737
00:55:39.351 --> 00:55:41.392
I am indeed. Sure when I saw man
running in the dark


738
00:55:41.441 --> 00:55:43.410
with a game bag in his hand,

739
00:55:43.477 --> 00:55:45.321
wasn't I the foolish one
to mistake him for a poacher?


740
00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:48.315
By the hokey, it did look bad.

741
00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:50.373
Will you forgive me?

742
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:53.420
Faith, a stepmother wouldn't blame ye.

743
00:55:53.487 --> 00:55:55.614
No harm done.

744
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.131
I'm sorry, but I promised his lordship
there'd be no poaching,


745
00:55:58.191 --> 00:56:00.592
and I can't make an exception,
not even for you,


746
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:02.925
- so you'll have to let the rabbit go.
- Rabbit indeed.


747
00:56:09.103 --> 00:56:12.095
I didn't intend to show him yet,
but you've been a nice fella.


748
00:56:12.173 --> 00:56:15.403
I'll give you the first look.
Bring him over here. Come on.


749
00:56:18.412 --> 00:56:21.779
Get ready for the grand surprise.

750
00:56:22.749 --> 00:56:25.685
It's no rabbit.

751
00:56:27.121 --> 00:56:29.715
- Rabbit or hare, what's the odds?
- Rabbit or hare?


752
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:31.553
You're lookin' at Brian of Knocknasheega,

753
00:56:31.935 --> 00:56:35.751
- king of all the leprechauns.
- 'Twas a rabbit I saw.


754
00:56:35.787 --> 00:56:37.125
Have another look.

755
00:56:44.805 --> 00:56:46.568
It's still a rabbit.

756
00:56:57.317 --> 00:57:01.379
- Try closin' one eye.
- Closing one eye?


757
00:57:08.362 --> 00:57:11.695
You've had a hard day today,
and a hard night last night.


758
00:57:11.766 --> 00:57:14.064
Now, why don't you go home to bed
and get a good rest?


759
00:57:14.135 --> 00:57:18.697
How could I rest,
and you thinkin' I'm a poacher?


760
00:57:20.841 --> 00:57:23.071
They take different shapes, you know?

761
00:57:23.144 --> 00:57:24.702
So I hear.

762
00:57:24.873 --> 00:57:27.612
Aye, you ought to see him
with his little gold crown


763
00:57:27.681 --> 00:57:28.648
and his red beard

764
00:57:28.649 --> 00:57:31.812
and his two eyes leapin'
from his head like flames.


765
00:57:31.886 --> 00:57:34.800
- I wish you could see him.
- Granted.


766
00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:36.984
And that's your second wish.

767
00:57:37.057 --> 00:57:39.855
Why, you tricky, deceivin',
connivin', double-dealin',


768
00:57:39.927 --> 00:57:42.862
- high-handed...
- Wirra, wirra, wirra.


769
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.262
That's what comes of a man
not yet threescore and 10


770
00:57:45.332 --> 00:57:51.420
matchin' his wits against an
intellectual gladiator 5,000 years old.


771
00:57:51.457 --> 00:57:52.977
Well, I still have me third wish left,

772
00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:54.951
and maybe me second one's not all wasted.

773
00:57:54.975 --> 00:57:57.375
Now, go on.
Make yourself visible to him.


774
00:57:57.445 --> 00:57:59.572
But I am visible to him.

775
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:03.447
You wished he should see me,
and see me he does.


776
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:07.716
- He sees me as a rabbit.
- You're a cheat and you're a liar.


777
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:13.522
- Don't tell me you can't hear him.
- I'm afraid I can't.


778
00:58:13.594 --> 00:58:17.394
What's the world comin' to?
I could have knocked a crock of gold


779
00:58:17.465 --> 00:58:19.433
out of this old chancer
with that second wish,


780
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:23.129
but I gave it all up for a man who
can neither hear nor see.


781
00:58:23.598 --> 00:58:27.038
Darby, he can see
me as I really am...

782
00:58:27.107 --> 00:58:30.076
in his dreams tonight.

783
00:58:31.378 --> 00:58:35.246
You can see him tonight in your dreams.

784
00:58:35.315 --> 00:58:36.647
Are you sure?

785
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.708
I am.

786
00:58:39.453 --> 00:58:41.250
He promised me.

787
00:58:50.731 --> 00:58:53.530
The last reel was the best one.

788
00:58:53.567 --> 00:58:55.178
You know, Katie,
you're so light on your feet,


789
00:58:55.202 --> 00:58:57.893
you could tread on cobwebs
without breaking them.


790
00:58:58.581 --> 00:58:59.472
- Thank you, Sean.
- May I take you home now?


791
00:58:59.473 --> 00:59:02.067
No need to trouble yourself.
Katie can ride home with me.


792
00:59:02.142 --> 00:59:04.804
- I think it...
- Can't she?


793
00:59:04.973 --> 00:59:07.245
That'll be grand, Pony.

794
00:59:07.314 --> 00:59:10.909
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Katie.


795
00:59:16.189 --> 00:59:18.590
Come on. Hup! Hup!

796
00:59:34.408 --> 00:59:37.501
Thank you for the ride.
Good night, Pony.


797
00:59:43.553 --> 00:59:46.976
Have you no pride, ridin' home
with the like of that?


798
00:59:47.054 --> 00:59:50.455
He was only bein' civil to me,
and I was no more than civil to him.


799
00:59:50.524 --> 00:59:54.255
Well, you'd better forget
about him altogether.


800
00:59:54.328 --> 00:59:56.455
Well, maybe I will...

801
00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.556
when me father stops
spyin' on me at windows.


802
00:59:59.633 --> 01:00:01.331
Tare and ages!

803
01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:04.080
Isn't that a nice way
for a girl to talk to her father?


804
01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:05.968
And she me one and only.

805
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.908
She's a fine girl, Katie,
but she's in mortal danger.


806
01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:12.171
- How do you mean that?
- 'Tis you,


807
01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:14.510
the way you're dillydallyin'
with your wishes.


808
01:00:14.582 --> 01:00:17.118
Phadrig Oge, he's me lieutenant.

809
01:00:17.827 --> 01:00:18.751
He'll stop at nothin'
till he gets me back.


810
01:00:18.752 --> 01:00:20.913
He might even put
the come-hither on Katie,


811
01:00:21.091 --> 01:00:22.716
so's you'd have to wish her free again.

812
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:25.020
If he lays a finger on Katie,

813
01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:28.118
I'll kill you dead
and murder you entirely.


814
01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:30.461
- Tell your Phadrig Oge that!
- Tell him?


815
01:00:30.497 --> 01:00:33.181
How can I give the order,
and me tied up in a sack?


816
01:00:33.218 --> 01:00:35.144
I'll throw you in the river
and drown you like a kitten.


817
01:00:35.168 --> 01:00:38.194
Do that, and you'll have a scourge
that'll make the potato famine


818
01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:41.730
- look like a Sunday regatta.
- Don't you threaten me.


819
01:00:41.808 --> 01:00:45.175
Your cows will die of the black leg
and your sheep of the red water,


820
01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:48.543
and in every cradle in town
there'll be a changeling!


821
01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:51.849
I'm not afraid of you.

822
01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:53.450
You'd better be.

823
01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:55.579
I'm the one that keeps
my kingdom in order,


824
01:00:55.656 --> 01:00:59.820
and all the unpleasant
spirits of the night will run wild


825
01:00:59.893 --> 01:01:01.471
unless you wish your
wish and let me go.

826
01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:04.464
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to wish for.


827
01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:08.125
Then, wish for the gold.

828
01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:10.102
I'll give it to you this time.

829
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.264
She doesn't want the gold
nor the manor house, neither.


830
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.035
- Who doesn't?
- Katie, I'm thinkin' of.


831
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:19.045
Well, what does she want?

832
01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:22.843
I don't know.
We were happy here, the two of us,


833
01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:24.717
but when I catch her
dancin' and whirligiggin'


834
01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:27.652
with a drunken blatherumskite
like Pony Sugrue...


835
01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:29.382
well, I don't know her at all.

836
01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:31.481
She needs to settle her mind

837
01:01:31.558 --> 01:01:33.822
on a good steady lad with temperate ways.

838
01:01:33.894 --> 01:01:35.326
That she does.

839
01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:37.990
What if she found such a lad
and fell in love with him,


840
01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:41.762
and he with her?
Would you wish your wish then?


841
01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:43.268
I would.

842
01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:46.204
Good. Now, go to
bed, have a good sleep.

843
01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:50.300
Leave all to me.
Put your mind at rest.


844
01:01:57.551 --> 01:02:01.647
Michael.

845
01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:04.321
What do you want?

846
01:02:04.358 --> 01:02:06.189
I said I'd visit your dreams,

847
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.160
and when I make
a promise, I keep it.

848
01:02:09.229 --> 01:02:11.458
Well, I've seen you.
Now go away.


849
01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:13.932
But I...

850
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:18.335
- I'd like to talk about Katie.
- How does she concern you?


851
01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.669
She's the one that's keepin' me here.

852
01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:24.177
Darby won't wish any more wishes
until his girl is pleased.


853
01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:27.111
Well, what can I do about it?

854
01:02:27.415 --> 01:02:31.584
Marry her, and you can all live here
as happy as three peas in a pod.


855
01:02:31.652 --> 01:02:33.142
I hardly know the girl.

856
01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.620
One look at her and you'll know her.

857
01:02:35.689 --> 01:02:39.385
She's a nice girl
and I like her, but...

858
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.553
Good.
Then next Sunday after Mass,


859
01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:43.823
take her up to the ruins
on the top of Knocknasheega.


860
01:02:44.432 --> 01:02:46.063
'Tis a fine romantic view from there.

861
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.900
Just lookin' down
will make any girl so dizzy,


862
01:02:47.968 --> 01:02:51.335
she'll fall into your arms.

863
01:02:51.405 --> 01:02:54.169
I don't want her
to fall into my arms.

864
01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:02.064
But then, of course,
I can't very well blame you.


865
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:04.480
Might mean gettin' your head broken.

866
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:07.145
I know if I was courtin'
Pony Sugrue's girl,


867
01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.586
I'd be afraid, too.

868
01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.681
Is it puttin' the coward's name
on me you are?


869
01:03:11.758 --> 01:03:14.990
No, no, no.
No, no. Go to sleep now.


870
01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:18.362
Go to sleep.
Good lad.


871
01:03:19.092 --> 01:03:20.823
Go to sleep.

872
01:03:25.706 --> 01:03:31.907
Katie.

873
01:03:31.979 --> 01:03:33.178
I say, Katie.

874
01:03:33.213 --> 01:03:36.774
He's a fine strong lad
with temperate ways.


875
01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:42.950
Michael is a fine strong lad
with temperate ways.


876
01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:46.584
He'd make you a grand husband.

877
01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.355
I don't want a husband.
Not yet.


878
01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:53.593
Not yet? Katie, many a girl
has spoke these words


879
01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.464
and lived to rue them.

880
01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:59.097
You know, when a girl is 20,
her boy will marry her up in a minute,


881
01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:01.607
but when she's 30,
doesn't she have a time


882
01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:03.734
trying to make him say the hard word?

883
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:07.247
- I'll have me courtship first.
- Courtship, is it?


884
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:10.373
And marriage the bone
and sinew of the country?


885
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:12.862
What would you call a girl
who'd keep her lad dangling


886
01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:16.219
through pure selfishness
or sinful dalliance?


887
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.553
I know what I'd call her.
I'd call her...


888
01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.616
I'd...

889
01:04:31.505 --> 01:04:32.704
Katie.

890
01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.073
Katie.

891
01:04:36.276 --> 01:04:37.971
Yes?

892
01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:43.415
I returned as a matter of courtesy
to give you the last word.


893
01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:46.111
Me last word...

894
01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:49.678
is no.

895
01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:52.816
That's grand.
That's grand.


896
01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:55.384
Keep on sayin' that.
Keep on sayin' that.


897
01:04:55.462 --> 01:04:58.192
Keep on sayin' that.

898
01:05:11.078 --> 01:05:14.241
"The ruins of old Ireland,
how wondrously they stand


899
01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:16.247
"by the lakes and rushing rivers

900
01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:18.511
on the hilltops of our land."

901
01:05:18.585 --> 01:05:21.782
"Around these walls of battle,
the Viking and the Dane,


902
01:05:21.855 --> 01:05:24.653
the Norman and the Saxon
and the Cavaliers of Spain."


903
01:05:24.725 --> 01:05:29.594
It makes a man feel like
the lord of the castle.


904
01:05:29.973 --> 01:05:33.326
I wonder now, is it
the Danes or the Vikings


905
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.233
swarming up the valley to storm the fort?

906
01:05:36.303 --> 01:05:40.205
- The Danes.
- We'll both be put to the sword.


907
01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:45.439
But before we are, you would crave
the favor of one last kiss.


908
01:05:45.512 --> 01:05:47.878
Mr. MacBride, I thought
you could do better than that.


909
01:05:49.242 --> 01:05:51.400
Maybe I could.

910
01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.597
You don't care who you
walk out with, do you?


911
01:06:27.621 --> 01:06:30.385
Get off this land, or I'll
report you to his lordship.


912
01:06:30.457 --> 01:06:32.015
You do that.

913
01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:41.467
Get out of the way.

914
01:06:42.234 --> 01:06:44.362
Look who's talking.

915
01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:49.366
If you lay a finger on him,
I'll never speak to you again!


916
01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:20.296
Katie...

917
01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:23.534
when I need your help against
the likes of that, I'll ask for it.


918
01:07:24.212 --> 01:07:25.573
Pony Sugrue would have killed you.

919
01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.646
- Would you care?
- Not in the slightest.


920
01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:34.949
You have no interest in me at all?

921
01:07:35.022 --> 01:07:38.321
You're certain sure?

922
01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:43.256
Kiss her.
Kiss her.


923
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.490
Go on, kiss her.

924
01:07:54.206 --> 01:07:57.120
And him a Dublin man!

925
01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:03.273
Look, look, look.

926
01:08:20.766 --> 01:08:22.598
Will you wish your wish now?

927
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:25.001
- I will indeed.
- Good.


928
01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.310
The bell.
Listen to the music of it.


929
01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:34.710
Father Murphy gave it to me.

930
01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:36.413
But the wish, Darby.

931
01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:39.851
It would charm the fishes from the deep

932
01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:42.248
and the little birds down from the trees.

933
01:08:42.322 --> 01:08:44.381
You said you'd wish your wish.

934
01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:48.690
What? On Sunday, with my music
floatin' over the countryside


935
01:08:48.762 --> 01:08:52.562
and Father Murphy himself
pullin' the rope?


936
01:08:52.632 --> 01:08:55.294
Tomorrow is Monday.
Will you wish your wish then?


937
01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:57.927
I will.
Hush now.


938
01:08:59.474 --> 01:09:02.106
Listen to my music.

939
01:09:11.183 --> 01:09:12.583
There.

940
01:09:12.652 --> 01:09:14.643
Hello, Joe.

941
01:09:19.692 --> 01:09:21.069
Morning, Mrs. O'Toole.
There's the post.


942
01:09:21.093 --> 01:09:22.823
Did the tea come down from Dublin?

943
01:09:22.896 --> 01:09:24.625
The pails, too.
Where's everybody going?


944
01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:27.531
To the pub.
Darby is making his third wish.


945
01:09:27.601 --> 01:09:31.127
His third wish?
The old fool.


946
01:09:31.203 --> 01:09:32.728
Old fool indeed.

947
01:09:32.806 --> 01:09:34.899
It's makin' too free with them, Darby is.

948
01:09:34.975 --> 01:09:37.603
When you sup with the devil,
you need a long spoon.


949
01:09:37.677 --> 01:09:40.145
From America.
Nora Cassidy's son.


950
01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:43.297
- There'll be money in that.
- The pails, Mrs. O'Toole.


951
01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:46.381
- Right you are, Pony.
- "Michael MacBride, Rathcullen."


952
01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:50.219
That's from the Lord Fitzpatrick.
I'd know his fist anywhere.


953
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:54.957
Look at the elegant swirls and all.

954
01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.695
So that's why his lordship
left him behind.


955
01:10:04.771 --> 01:10:07.433
And now 'tis "Michael" this
and "Michael" that.


956
01:10:07.506 --> 01:10:09.270
The Dublin jackeen.

957
01:10:09.342 --> 01:10:11.053
"And, Michael, go and open up
the manor house


958
01:10:11.077 --> 01:10:14.807
- "and get Katie in to help."
- The dirty usurper!


959
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.941
- Poor old Darby.
- Poor Katie.


960
01:10:18.018 --> 01:10:20.713
I wonder, does she know?

961
01:10:20.786 --> 01:10:26.191
Maybe you should drop it by
and leave her see it for herself.


962
01:10:26.258 --> 01:10:29.660
You think I should, now?

963
01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:34.496
No Christian bein' would do any less.

964
01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.957
Then I will so.

965
01:10:37.903 --> 01:10:42.068
Look, Pony, his lordship wrote it
to young Michael MacBride,


966
01:10:42.142 --> 01:10:45.134
and nary a word to
Darby, now I ask you.

967
01:10:48.215 --> 01:10:51.012
And you said you had an understanding

968
01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.483
with his lordship about me,

969
01:10:52.551 --> 01:10:54.816
and all this time, 
MacBride has the job.

970
01:10:54.888 --> 01:10:57.857
He won't keep the job
if I have a son who's man enough


971
01:10:57.923 --> 01:11:00.722
to run him out of town.

972
01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:05.758
Well, Pony?

973
01:11:21.348 --> 01:11:23.543
What are you doing?

974
01:11:23.617 --> 01:11:28.680
I'm packing, and if you don't know
why, you can read the card.


975
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.431
Why didn't you tell me?

976
01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:43.833
Your father made me promise
that I wouldn't.


977
01:11:43.903 --> 01:11:46.497
- When are you throwin' us out?
- Now, Katie.


978
01:11:46.573 --> 01:11:50.338
- When?
- Well, today was supposed to have...


979
01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:54.243
- You give short notice.
- I don't want you to leave at all.


980
01:11:54.314 --> 01:11:57.112
Why not?
What does it matter to you


981
01:11:57.183 --> 01:11:59.208
if you break an old man's heart?

982
01:11:59.286 --> 01:12:01.264
You're a strong young man.
You can find work anywhere,


983
01:12:01.288 --> 01:12:03.620
but, no, you must come here
and take me father's place.


984
01:12:03.689 --> 01:12:07.319
No wonder he's chasin' the fairy gold,
and him half out of his mind,


985
01:12:07.394 --> 01:12:10.488
tryin' to keep some little bit
of self-respect in the town.


986
01:12:12.531 --> 01:12:16.161
Here, you can clean
the manor house yourself.


987
01:12:16.236 --> 01:12:17.813
It'll be all we can do
to move our belongin's


988
01:12:17.837 --> 01:12:19.737
out of your house this night.

989
01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:22.900
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want your father's job at all,


990
01:12:22.976 --> 01:12:25.410
not unless I can have
the both of you along with it.


991
01:12:25.478 --> 01:12:27.673
I want you to stay
here and be my wife.

992
01:12:27.747 --> 01:12:30.875
I love you, Katie, and I think
that you love me.


993
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:33.783
I?
Love you?


994
01:12:45.432 --> 01:12:47.827
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, we're all ready, Darby.


995
01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:50.008
Run and get a
turf creel, a big one.

996
01:12:50.163 --> 01:12:51.534
- What for?
- For to hold the gold.


997
01:12:51.604 --> 01:12:53.970
- I'll not wish for the gold.
- Why not?


998
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.908
Nine times out of ten,
it leads to unhappiness.


999
01:12:57.977 --> 01:12:59.638
Wish for happiness, then.

1000
01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:03.342
Human beings need bitter with the sweet.

1001
01:13:04.383 --> 01:13:07.285
When I was a young lad,
knee high with a sod of turf,


1002
01:13:07.354 --> 01:13:11.654
me grandfather Podge...
God be good to him...


1003
01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:15.559
he told me there was
only one man in the town


1004
01:13:15.628 --> 01:13:19.029
who was happy altogether...

1005
01:13:19.099 --> 01:13:20.199
the village idiot.

1006
01:13:23.269 --> 01:13:25.464
Were you addressing me, Your Majesty?

1007
01:13:25.538 --> 01:13:28.304
What's all the speechmaking about?

1008
01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:30.138
Are you standin' for Parliament or what?

1009
01:13:30.209 --> 01:13:33.077
- Will I get you a drink, sir?
- You could make a wish.


1010
01:13:33.145 --> 01:13:34.670
- Get on with it.
- I'll do that.


1011
01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:36.807
You know what I'd wish for, Darby?

1012
01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:39.375
I'd wish for a grand,
big house on top of a hill,


1013
01:13:39.452 --> 01:13:41.386
as big as the castle at Cong.

1014
01:13:42.465 --> 01:13:44.033
- How would you look after it?
- I'd have the servants, too.


1015
01:13:44.057 --> 01:13:45.786
You didn't wish for the servants,

1016
01:13:45.859 --> 01:13:47.850
You didn't wish for the money
to run the house.


1017
01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:51.555
There you'd be with a big house
in your hands, as big as a church,


1018
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:54.827
and you the poorest church mouse in it.

1019
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.232
Did you hear that?

1020
01:13:56.302 --> 01:13:59.863
He's got a head on his
shoulders like Aristotle.


1021
01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:01.839
- Think of the best...
- Father!


1022
01:14:01.907 --> 01:14:04.900
Then ask yourself,
"What else might I lose if I had it?"


1023
01:14:04.978 --> 01:14:06.788
Father, you've got to come
and catch the horse.


1024
01:14:06.812 --> 01:14:08.011
Not now, Katie.

1025
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.174
His lordship is comin'.
We've got to move today!


1026
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.260
Move out of the way, Katie.
I'm makin' me third wish.


1027
01:14:12.284 --> 01:14:14.480
Not here, Father!

1028
01:14:16.656 --> 01:14:18.180
Wait, Your Highness!

1029
01:14:20.026 --> 01:14:23.920
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!


1030
01:14:23.996 --> 01:14:26.431
Catch him, Darby!
Catch the coinin!


1031
01:14:28.868 --> 01:14:30.067
Darby, catch the coinin!

1032
01:14:30.069 --> 01:14:32.697
Make him give you the crocks of gold!
The crocks of gold!


1033
01:14:41.181 --> 01:14:42.924
- Get out of my way.
- Leave that horse alone.


1034
01:14:42.948 --> 01:14:45.236
Do you think I'd stay under
your roof another night?


1035
01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:46.117
- I'll go to the inn.
- You can go to blazes.


1036
01:14:46.118 --> 01:14:47.586
I'm movin' to the McCarthy house.

1037
01:14:47.653 --> 01:14:49.849
With night coming down on
that mountainside,


1038
01:14:49.923 --> 01:14:51.089
you could get yourself killed.

1039
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:53.388
Now, give me that halter.
I'll get the horse.


1040
01:15:47.514 --> 01:15:49.448
Well, you look grand.

1041
01:15:49.516 --> 01:15:53.384
Now, don't move a finger
until his lordship comes.


1042
01:15:58.958 --> 01:16:00.754
Katie!

1043
01:16:03.763 --> 01:16:05.458
Katie!

1044
01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:23.544
Katie!

1045
01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:31.079
Katie!

1046
01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:35.050
Katie!

1047
01:16:37.596 --> 01:16:39.588
Katie!

1048
01:16:51.177 --> 01:16:53.475
Is it drunk you are?

1049
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.117
- Who did it, lad?
- I don't know, but I can guess.


1050
01:17:07.193 --> 01:17:10.002
- Where's Katie?
- She's gone after the horse.


1051
01:17:10.038 --> 01:17:12.495
Did you let her go alone
in the dark of the night?


1052
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:15.261
She was in a tearin' rage at me,
and sure it was your fault


1053
01:17:15.335 --> 01:17:17.268
for not telling her the truth
in the first place.


1054
01:17:17.337 --> 01:17:20.602
God forgive me.
She'll be chasin' a puca.


1055
01:17:24.135 --> 01:17:26.811
For goodness sakes.

1056
01:17:31.718 --> 01:17:34.619
- The banshee!
- Maybe it's just the wind.


1057
01:17:34.687 --> 01:17:37.554
It's the wail of the banshee,

1058
01:17:38.274 --> 01:17:41.425
the same as I heard the night
that Katie's mother was taken.


1059
01:17:41.494 --> 01:17:45.225
She'll be destroyed entirely!

1060
01:17:59.912 --> 01:18:02.038
Katie!

1061
01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:07.415
Katie!

1062
01:18:15.995 --> 01:18:20.155
Katie!

1063
01:18:20.618 --> 01:18:21.996
Katie!

1064
01:18:24.163 --> 01:18:25.363
Katie!

1065
01:18:28.074 --> 01:18:30.482
Katie!

1066
01:18:33.311 --> 01:18:35.405
Katie.

1067
01:18:36.282 --> 01:18:38.147
Katie!

1068
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.129
Katie!

1069
01:19:16.155 --> 01:19:18.055
The banshee!

1070
01:19:30.002 --> 01:19:32.061
Keep away!
Keep away!


1071
01:19:39.612 --> 01:19:40.909
Keep away from her!

1072
01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.326
Keep off!

1073
01:19:48.521 --> 01:19:51.490
Keep off, now!
Keep off, now!


1074
01:20:01.534 --> 01:20:03.559
Me poor darlin'.

1075
01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:06.265
Your daddy didn't mean
to do you any harm.


1076
01:20:06.339 --> 01:20:09.307
- Speak to me. Speak to me.
- Darby.


1077
01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:11.935
What have I done to you?

1078
01:20:12.011 --> 01:20:14.808
We'd better get her home.

1079
01:22:27.445 --> 01:22:30.812
Brian!
King Brian!


1080
01:22:30.883 --> 01:22:34.181
King Brian!
King Brian!


1081
01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:35.652
What is it, man?

1082
01:22:36.989 --> 01:22:39.651
- Your Highness!
- What is it?


1083
01:22:39.724 --> 01:22:42.558
It's the coiste-bodhar,
the death coach.


1084
01:22:42.628 --> 01:22:44.299
Send it away!

1085
01:22:48.134 --> 01:22:51.535
It's comin' for Katie.
Send it away.


1086
01:22:51.604 --> 01:22:53.629
But it's not within my powers, man.

1087
01:22:53.706 --> 01:22:56.230
Once it sets out,
it can never return empty.


1088
01:22:56.309 --> 01:22:59.767
Then give me me third wish
and let it take me instead.


1089
01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:02.075
You don't know what you're askin' for.

1090
01:23:02.148 --> 01:23:04.514
You promised!
Don't break your word.


1091
01:23:04.582 --> 01:23:07.142
Darby O'Gill, never in me born days...

1092
01:23:07.218 --> 01:23:09.312
Give me me third wish.

1093
01:23:10.623 --> 01:23:14.080
More's the pity.
Granted.


1094
01:23:49.478 --> 01:23:51.720
Darby O'Gill.

1095
01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:59.978
Get in.

1096
01:25:00.366 --> 01:25:04.930
Darby.

1097
01:25:05.004 --> 01:25:08.064
I was on me way back home,
and I says to myself,


1098
01:25:08.139 --> 01:25:11.405
"Brian," says I,
"'tis at his side you should be."


1099
01:25:11.477 --> 01:25:14.139
Well, then, the truth of it is,

1100
01:25:14.814 --> 01:25:16.612
I'm real glad to see you.

1101
01:25:16.682 --> 01:25:19.980
Darby, me boy,

1102
01:25:20.052 --> 01:25:23.817
- we've had great sport together.
- Aye, we did.


1103
01:25:24.957 --> 01:25:27.289
You've been a grand adversary.

1104
01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:30.794
'Tis sorry I am to
see you come to this.

1105
01:25:31.163 --> 01:25:33.922
I can endure anything
if Katie was all right.


1106
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:36.365
You needn't fret about Katie.

1107
01:25:36.434 --> 01:25:40.462
Her fever broke the minute
you set foot in this coach.


1108
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.671
I'll be forever grateful to you.

1109
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:54.209
In the years to come,

1110
01:25:54.285 --> 01:25:58.279
maybe you'd keep an eye
on Katie and Michael.


1111
01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:00.348
I'll do that.

1112
01:26:02.962 --> 01:26:06.454
'Tis a pity you won't be there
to see them married.


1113
01:26:06.532 --> 01:26:10.696
It's better for the old to die
than the young.


1114
01:26:10.769 --> 01:26:13.863
In the end, we all have to go.

1115
01:26:13.938 --> 01:26:15.930
That you do.

1116
01:26:21.046 --> 01:26:23.844
I wish I could go
with you all the way.

1117
01:26:25.718 --> 01:26:27.345
I wish you could, too.

1118
01:26:31.423 --> 01:26:33.391
And you a knowledgeable man!

1119
01:26:35.294 --> 01:26:39.492
Darby, you've wished your fourth wish.

1120
01:26:39.564 --> 01:26:43.500
Goodbye, Darby, me friend.

1121
01:26:59.084 --> 01:27:04.121
It's a miracle. She's fine and sonsy,
like a baby woken from sleep.


1122
01:27:12.932 --> 01:27:14.991
Michael, what a temper I have.

1123
01:27:15.668 --> 01:27:17.300
Well...

1124
01:27:17.336 --> 01:27:19.702
I like a lively girl.

1125
01:27:23.274 --> 01:27:25.971
I suppose I'm the only man alive today

1126
01:27:26.045 --> 01:27:30.141
to have rode in the coiste-bodhar
and come back to tell it.


1127
01:27:30.216 --> 01:27:31.945
Coiste-bodhar.

1128
01:27:32.017 --> 01:27:33.983
'Twas his lordship's carriage you saw.

1129
01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:37.853
His coachman told me they found
you rootin' in the mud of the road,


1130
01:27:37.922 --> 01:27:41.359
so far gone in grief you were
out of your mind entirely.


1131
01:27:43.696 --> 01:27:46.824
Pony, I heard you were goin'
to live in Cahersiveen.


1132
01:27:46.899 --> 01:27:47.966
I am.

1133
01:27:47.967 --> 01:27:50.491
Then why don't you be on your way
and leave us alone?


1134
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:51.869
Don't worry.
I will.


1135
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.859
I've heard enough silly blather
about little people


1136
01:27:55.558 --> 01:27:56.474
to last me a lifetime.

1137
01:27:56.475 --> 01:28:00.411
What kind of man are you at all that
doesn't believe in the little people?


1138
01:28:00.479 --> 01:28:03.812
- Maybe you'd like to find out.
- Indeed I would.


1139
01:28:03.882 --> 01:28:06.544
You know, somebody beat me
over the head that night,


1140
01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:08.814
and I thought it was the little people,

1141
01:28:08.887 --> 01:28:10.487
but when I spoke
to King Brian about it,

1142
01:28:10.938 --> 01:28:12.822
he said that you
should take the consequences.


1143
01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:15.417
What consequences?

1144
01:28:15.493 --> 01:28:17.794
Indeed, that's what I asked his majesty,

1145
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:21.060
and you know what he said?
He said, "If I were you",


1146
01:28:21.433 --> 01:28:23.423
I'd clout the blackguard in the face."

1147
01:28:45.357 --> 01:28:48.553
Gosh.

1148
01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:03.498
Come on.

1149
01:29:33.505 --> 01:29:36.633
Pony, me darlin'.
You poor thing.


1150
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:39.472
Hold your whisht.
I'll have no more from you.


1151
01:29:39.545 --> 01:29:42.604
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Now I can get back to work.


1152
01:29:42.681 --> 01:29:46.549
I even feel like workin' myself.
I do indeed. Aye.


1153
01:29:46.685 --> 01:29:48.729
How do you feel about bringin' in
the rest of the turf?


1154
01:29:48.753 --> 01:29:50.915
Well, lad, you took the words
right out of me mouth.


1155
01:29:50.989 --> 01:29:53.423
Come around, Cleopatra.
Come on, now.
