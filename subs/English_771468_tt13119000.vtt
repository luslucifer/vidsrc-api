00:08:58.594 --> 00:09:00.035
Great selection, by the way.

170
00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:01.122
They were.

171
00:09:01.154 --> 00:09:02.786
They're gonna be scratched now.

172
00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:04.866
No, babe, don't worry,
they'll be fine!


173
00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:06.562
- I love your jacket!
- This?


174
00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:08.003
- Black Wire?
- Yeah, Rocket!


175
00:09:08.034 --> 00:09:10.146
Ooh, Rocket, nice.

176
00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:12.386
You should come tonight.

177
00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.466
Okay, all right, cool!

178
00:09:14.498 --> 00:09:15.714
All right, I'll see you then!

179
00:09:15.747 --> 00:09:18.371
All right, see you then!

180
00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:19.427

I mean it, babe.

187
00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:39.266
You don't remember anything?

188
00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:41.474
- The after party?
- Can we just not, Daniel?


189
00:09:41.507 --> 00:09:42.754
It's buzzkill enough

190
00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:46.115
that we're going
to my grandmother's funeral.


191
00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:48.514
Can you even read that?

192
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.211
Sure I can.

193
00:09:50.243 --> 00:09:51.938
(chuckling)

194
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.506
- Fuck.
- Mm.


195
00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:02.946
Exactly.

196
00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:04.803
It's okay,
because my brother Tim,


197
00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:08.387
he said that he'd read it for me
if I bottle it, so it's cool.


198
00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:11.106
Oh, my God, I can't wait
for you to meet him.


199
00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:12.418
And Mom! Mom's gonna see you!

200
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.363
She loves you!

201
00:10:15.394 --> 00:10:17.187
When did you write it?

202
00:10:17.218 --> 00:10:21.666
Um... I was like nine
or 10 or something.


203
00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:22.787
It's not Shakespeare.

204
00:10:22.818 --> 00:10:25.923
(chuckling)

205
00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:27.778
You and your Nan
were close then, yeah?


206
00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:31.266
Yeah.

207
00:10:33.026 --> 00:10:33.603
We were.

208
00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:37.858
Anyway.

209
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.034

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.954
To Gran! Woo!

212
00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:47.074
At least try and hide it.

213
00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:48.771
It's 9:30 A.M.

214
00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:50.498
It's okay,
it's breakfast vodka.


215
00:10:50.531 --> 00:10:53.378
You see, you can have anything
in the morning


216
00:10:53.411 --> 00:10:55.106
if you put "breakfast"
in front of it.


217
00:10:55.138 --> 00:10:57.603
Breakfast vodka,
breakfast hang gliding,


218
00:10:57.634 --> 00:11:00.578
- breakfast crack, breakfast...
- Denial, babe.


219
00:11:00.611 --> 00:11:03.298
Breakfast denial,
this is pure denial on toast,


220
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.675
- come on!
- What?


221
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:05.891
Okay, fine, what did I do?

222
00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:07.682
Did I step on your boots?

223
00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:09.154
Did I fuck your crush?

224
00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:12.867
Did I slag someone off
to their face again?


225
00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:13.923
- What?
- Yeah,


226
00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:15.522
all of the above, actually.

227
00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:16.674
But that's not
what I'm talking about.


228
00:11:16.707 --> 00:11:21.090
What is with this Mike Lee
intervention bullshit, Daniel?


229
00:11:21.122 --> 00:11:24.066
For God's sake,
whatever I did, I am sorry.


230
00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:25.890
Can we not just move on?

231
00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:27.267
Let me think about it, no.

232
00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:30.946
Fine.

233
00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:32.163
I remember having lots of fun.

234
00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:33.858
And after that, after the fun?

235
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.378
We ran for a train,
I pinched an old man's ass,


236
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.714
- and now we're here.
- No.


237
00:11:39.747 --> 00:11:43.235
When did you become
such a buzzkill anyway?


238
00:11:43.266 --> 00:11:45.411
I'm going for a piss.

239
00:11:45.442 --> 00:11:47.138
Watch my shit.

240
00:11:57.475 --> 00:11:58.466
Hey, babe.

241
00:11:58.498 --> 00:11:59.907
Here's perfect.

242
00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:02.402
Thank you!

243
00:12:02.435 --> 00:12:04.578
- Hey!
- Oh!


244
00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:05.571
You bitch!

245
00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:06.819
You missed our set last night.

246
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.226
- I...
- You were shagging Stevie,


247
00:12:08.258 --> 00:12:10.146
- weren't you?
- I would never miss


248
00:12:10.178 --> 00:12:12.131
- a Highkick's DJ set.
- Sure, sure.


249
00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:13.154
So what did we play?

250
00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:17.314
LCD Soundsystem, Giant Drag,
Le Tigre, Hot Chip,


251
00:12:17.347 --> 00:12:19.618
and that fit band from New York,

252
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.947
- The Fuckheads.
- Fine, I'll let you off.


253
00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:25.346
How's Jasper?
I heard his label dropped him.


254
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:26.658
You know.

255
00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:28.546
He's not taking it out on you,
is he, babe?


256
00:12:28.578 --> 00:12:30.178
He's just having a hard time
at the moment.


257
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.235
We're fine.

258
00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:32.547
Do you need me to kill him?

259
00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:35.234
Not if I get there first.

260
00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:37.058
- Is Zee here?
- Yeah.


261
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.370
She's already off her nut.

262
00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:40.194
She's not slept
in like three days.


263
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.178
Oh, and she bit my neck earlier.

264
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.554
Terrifying.

265
00:12:43.586 --> 00:12:44.642
- Wish me luck.
- You'll need it.


266
00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:46.658
Oh, and tell Daniel
that I've already gone in, yeah?


267
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:47.811
He's already in there, babe.

268
00:12:47.842 --> 00:12:49.314
- What?
- Yeah.


269
00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:51.618
I swear that bitch
has a jetpack.


270
00:12:56.578 --> 00:12:58.050
- Hello, trouble.
- Hey.


271
00:12:58.082 --> 00:12:59.490
Tell that Zee
to stop biting people.


272
00:12:59.523 --> 00:13:01.922
She's putting me in
an awkward fucking position.


273
00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:03.011
Hey, pipe down, city boy.

274
00:13:03.042 --> 00:13:05.091
You're lucky if you even
get in with that haircut.


275
00:13:05.122 --> 00:13:06.626

00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:54.307
How have you been?

301
00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:55.682
This tune!

302
00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:57.987
This is my tune!

303
00:13:58.018 --> 00:13:59.778
They wrote it about me,
you know.


304
00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:01.506
Babe.

305
00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:03.266
Look, do you have any...

306
00:14:03.298 --> 00:14:05.602
Oh, it's fucking massive
this one!


307
00:14:05.634 --> 00:14:08.034
I heard them play it
at side stage at Reading.


308
00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:09.667
Me and the lead singer
are like this.


309
00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.394
Babe, I was there, remember?

310
00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:13.411
Do you not remember?

311
00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:17.186
- No, I kinda need...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah?


312
00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:18.722
You need some what?

313
00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:21.219
What?

314
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:25.282
- Babe, you're not...
- Don't call me "babe."


315
00:14:25.314 --> 00:14:26.851
You owe me money, Lara.

316
00:14:26.883 --> 00:14:28.867
Don't pretend
that you don't remember.


317
00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:32.098
I'm not that fucking stupid.

318
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.922
People are always
taking the piss.


319
00:14:33.954 --> 00:14:35.202

No, I was just kidding!

325
00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:46.754
You really got me, darling.

326
00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:48.067
I'm sorry, I just don't have
my wallet with me is...


327
00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:48.931
Yeah, it's fine!

328
00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:50.819
Just get me into
the after party, yeah?


329
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:52.514
That goes without saying, babe.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.099
It's important that
we talk about this now.


495
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.827
God's sake, Daniel!

496
00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:27.810
We are going
to my grandmother's funeral.


497
00:22:27.843 --> 00:22:29.699
Is it really the time
to be having a go at me?


498
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.547
Oi, that's enough of that.

499
00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:34.211
- Babe?
- What?


500
00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:36.483
I'm not having a go at you.

501
00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:38.466
But I really need you
to listen to me, all right?


502
00:22:38.499 --> 00:22:40.835
- Have you got any cash?
- No, mate.


503
00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:42.691
I swear I had some.

504
00:22:42.722 --> 00:22:43.715
(groaning)

505
00:22:43.747 --> 00:22:45.538
Look.

506
00:22:45.571 --> 00:22:47.555
Don't worry about it.

507
00:22:47.587 --> 00:22:48.834
I'm sorry for your loss.

508
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.754
Oh, you're a babe!

509
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.194
Thank you!

510
00:22:55.714 --> 00:22:58.274
(groaning)

511
00:22:58.307 --> 00:22:59.906
- Hey, sis.
- Hey, bro.


512
00:22:59.938 --> 00:23:02.178
Hey, mate.

513
00:23:02.211 --> 00:23:03.811
Look after her, yeah?

514
00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:05.250
Cool.

515
00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:06.147
New mate?

516
00:23:06.179 --> 00:23:08.194
Yeah, this... mm.

517
00:23:21.955 --> 00:23:23.331
(indistinct whispering)

518
00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:25.122
Lara, you're here!

519
00:23:26.307 --> 00:23:28.131
- Is that Lara?
- Yeah.


520
00:23:28.163 --> 00:23:32.194
You look... fascinating.

521
00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:34.179
I'm so sorry to hear
about Granny.


522
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.266
I know you were close.

523
00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:38.242
Quick, quick, let's see
who can touch Lara first?


524
00:23:38.275 --> 00:23:40.162
Hands where we can see 'em,
Andrew, you creepy old git.


525
00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:41.442
Hello, Uncle Andrew.

526
00:23:41.474 --> 00:23:43.075
Not a famous artist yet then?

527
00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:44.131
Not yet.

528
00:23:44.162 --> 00:23:45.474
Still working on it.

529
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:46.882
You were always jolly creative

530
00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:48.546
with your sandcastles
as a child.


531
00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:51.011
Perhaps you could move
into architecture.


532
00:23:51.042 --> 00:23:53.154
I'll consider it.

533
00:23:53.187 --> 00:23:54.914
Horrid news about Granny.

534
00:23:54.947 --> 00:23:57.186
She always made
a spiffing trifle.


535
00:23:57.219 --> 00:23:59.043
Our George is doing
rather good in the city.


536
00:23:59.074 --> 00:24:01.698
He's here with
his new fiancée, Bea.


537
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:03.810
She's heir to
a biscuit fortune, you know.


538
00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:06.594
And she has
a marvelous backside!


539
00:24:06.627 --> 00:24:09.091
Oh, here they are.

540
00:24:09.122 --> 00:24:10.659
Hey, cuz.

541
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.354
Jolly shite news
about Granny, eh?


542
00:24:12.387 --> 00:24:14.403
Still, (indistinct) 103?

543
00:24:14.434 --> 00:24:15.875
Bugger me.

544
00:24:15.907 --> 00:24:19.555
Anyway, this is
my better half, Beatrice.


545
00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:21.635
Oh, you can call me Beastie!

546
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.843
That's what the girls call me
at the rowing club,


547
00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:26.627
seeing as
we're going to be family!


548
00:24:26.658 --> 00:24:28.195
Hi, Beastie.

549
00:24:28.226 --> 00:24:31.235
Congratulations,
George is a catch.


550
00:24:31.267 --> 00:24:32.962
You're telling me!

551
00:24:32.995 --> 00:24:34.915
It took a while
to wear him down,


552
00:24:34.946 --> 00:24:36.323
but I got there,
didn't I, bunny?


553
00:24:36.354 --> 00:24:37.762
You did, puppet!

554
00:24:37.795 --> 00:24:38.882
I did!

555
00:24:38.915 --> 00:24:41.954
So Daddy is thinking of using
our estate in Berkshire


556
00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:45.602
for the reception,
and I was going to ask


557
00:24:45.635 --> 00:24:48.547
if you would be a bridesmaid!

558
00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:50.946
You're screaming for a makeover!

559
00:24:50.979 --> 00:24:53.282
Ooh, I can't wait!

560
00:24:53.315 --> 00:24:54.563
Neither can I.

561
00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:56.610
Excuse us, humans,

562
00:24:56.643 --> 00:24:59.363
we need to go and help Dad
arrange his brain.


563
00:24:59.394 --> 00:25:03.715
(♪♪♪)

564
00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:04.866
Stick out if you can.

565
00:25:04.898 --> 00:25:05.922
Are you okay?
Have you washed?


566
00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:07.011
I can't think about it.

567
00:25:07.043 --> 00:25:08.738
If I think about it,
then I'm gonna be sick again,


568
00:25:08.771 --> 00:25:10.978
and there is no way
that I can do...


569
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.707
I can't do this, one of you two
are gonna have to do it.


570
00:25:12.738 --> 00:25:14.402
Fuck, okay, but you owe me.

571
00:25:14.435 --> 00:25:15.651
All right, give it here.

572
00:25:15.683 --> 00:25:20.066
(♪♪♪)

573
00:25:20.098 --> 00:25:21.666
Mother of a pig... pig?

574
00:25:21.699 --> 00:25:23.875
Mother of... what?

575
00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:25.058
I can't read
your fucking writing.


576
00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:26.178
I can't even fucking read this.

577
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:27.138
What the fuck have you written?

578
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:29.123
Well, give me a break,
it's like mystical,


579
00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:30.018
Scripture-like vibes.

580
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:32.515
And I stained the paper
with tea as well.


581
00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:34.562
Looks like
you're on your own, kid.


582
00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:36.355
You're gonna be fine.

583
00:25:36.386 --> 00:25:38.627
- Oh, fuck.
- You can do it.


584
00:25:38.658 --> 00:25:44.418
(♪♪♪)

585
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:46.498
Hello, sweetie.

586
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.915
(♪♪♪)

587
00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:52.163
Hey, Mama.

588
00:25:52.194 --> 00:25:54.051
My girl!

589
00:25:54.082 --> 00:25:56.259
My darling girl!

590
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.891
How are you?

591
00:25:57.922 --> 00:25:59.362
Did you get here okay?

592
00:25:59.395 --> 00:26:01.378
I mean, you're here,
so I suppose you did.


593
00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:03.202
Everything's organized,
don't worry.


594
00:26:03.235 --> 00:26:04.322
Oh, you've got the poem?

595
00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:05.698
- Yeah, I...
- Good.


596
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.522
Well, I'm okay.

597
00:26:07.554 --> 00:26:11.011
Dodgy knee's playing up a bit,
but I soldier on.


598
00:26:11.042 --> 00:26:13.378
Fifi has been amazing!

599
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.778
She arranged all the flowers.

600
00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:17.346
Everyone's been
congratulating me


601
00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:20.802
on looking after me own mom
in her last years.


602
00:26:20.834 --> 00:26:23.395
Single-handedly,
but I'm no hero.


603
00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:25.026
No, I won't have it.

604
00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:25.794
I'm not.

605
00:26:25.827 --> 00:26:27.778
After 30 years
in show business,


606
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.411
I'm ready for anything!

607
00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:31.587
Right, here we go!

608
00:26:31.618 --> 00:26:33.411
Showtime.

609
00:26:33.442 --> 00:26:35.075
Single-handedly?

610
00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:36.514
Save it.

611
00:26:36.546 --> 00:26:38.211
At least I've avoided Fifi.

612
00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:39.778
Don't speak so soon.

613
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.218
(♪♪♪)

614
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.811
- Darling!
- Oh, here we go.


615
00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:47.106
Fifi, I thought you said
I had to wear black.


616
00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:48.771
No. Did I say that?

617
00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:51.778
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, well, never mind.


618
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.866
You know what I'm like.

619
00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:56.258
Couldn't resist a little bit
of color for Granny.


620
00:26:56.291 --> 00:26:59.010
Oh, Granny.

621
00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:01.378
It's not right.

622
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.107
These were hers.

623
00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:04.898
And I love them, Granny.

624
00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:07.746
They look fabulous on me.

625
00:27:07.778 --> 00:27:08.994
But you, darling,

626
00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.395
oh, look at you!

627
00:27:11.426 --> 00:27:16.322
You look... how much
do you weigh now?


628
00:27:16.355 --> 00:27:17.763
Adrian!

629
00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:19.650
Darling!

630
00:27:19.683 --> 00:27:21.666
(♪♪♪)

631
00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:23.042
What was that?

632
00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.410
That was Fifi, 
Dad's pet twat.

633
00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:28.098
She's happy.

634
00:27:28.131 --> 00:27:29.730
Well, the house is hers now.

635
00:27:29.762 --> 00:27:31.042
No.

636
00:27:31.074 --> 00:27:32.163
Do you think?

637
00:27:32.194 --> 00:27:34.530
How much do I weigh?

638
00:27:34.562 --> 00:27:36.930
Well, maybe she could eat you.

639
00:27:36.963 --> 00:27:38.787
That's one way
of getting rid of you.


640
00:27:38.818 --> 00:27:40.611
God help me.

641
00:27:40.642 --> 00:27:43.138
(♪♪♪)

642
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.058
Fucking troll,
that's the thing.


643
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.362
I'm just like...
do you know who I love?


644
00:27:47.394 --> 00:27:48.835
I love Bella.

645
00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:50.499
She's always... the thing is

646
00:27:50.531 --> 00:27:52.770
even though I'm clearly
like the party one,


647
00:27:52.802 --> 00:27:55.682
she's like... yeah,
but she's also the party one.


648
00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:57.635
I feel like she always has
the most fun.


649
00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.907
Like she's always like,
"Oh, touch me, touch me!"


650
00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:01.634
Ohh!

651
00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.907
Listen... oh, my God,
look who it is.


652
00:28:03.939 --> 00:28:05.571
- You've gotta do it.
- I'm gonna do it.


653
00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:07.266
- Are you gonna do it?
- Fuck it!


654
00:28:07.298 --> 00:28:09.026
- All right.
- Do it here.


655
00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:10.530
(♪♪♪)

656
00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:12.035
- Hi, you all right?
- Yeah.


657
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:12.995
I don't know
if you remember me,


658
00:28:13.026 --> 00:28:14.722
but I'm actually
one of your biggest fans.


659
00:28:14.754 --> 00:28:15.875
But I'm also an artist,

660
00:28:15.906 --> 00:28:17.954
and I was thinking that maybe
we could, like, sit down,


661
00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:19.107
have a chat,
because I wanted to, like,


662
00:28:19.138 --> 00:28:20.610
design some of your next flyers

663
00:28:20.642 --> 00:28:22.434
or even like the artwork
for your next single.


664
00:28:22.466 --> 00:28:23.586
I don't know where
the rest of the band are,


665
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:24.834
but maybe we could just,
like, hang out,


666
00:28:24.867 --> 00:28:25.666
have a drink or something cool,

667
00:28:25.698 --> 00:28:27.747
like there's
an after party and...


668
00:28:27.778 --> 00:28:28.867
We can do that sometime,

669
00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:31.331
but I've got to actually
shoot off right now, love, so...


670
00:28:31.362 --> 00:28:33.314
but listen, if I were you,
I'd go home as well, love,


671
00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:36.002
because your nose is bleeding.

672
00:28:36.035 --> 00:28:37.314
Dorian, come on, babe.

673
00:28:37.347 --> 00:28:39.875
All right.

674
00:28:39.906 --> 00:28:42.242
Before you go, stick that
in your pocket, yeah?


675
00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:44.067
Have a good night,
I'll see you soon.


676
00:28:44.098 --> 00:28:46.626
- Cheers.
- Buy some jeans that fit.

00:28:54.434 --> 00:28:55.779

682
00:29:00.035 --> 00:29:01.314

683
00:29:01.347 --> 00:29:03.074

- Ooh, babe?

686
00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:09.090
Don't forget it's your Nan's
funeral tomorrow.


687
00:29:09.123 --> 00:29:10.754
Look, I'm gonna go
for an hour, an hour!


688
00:29:10.786 --> 00:29:12.099
- An hour.
- An hour!


689
00:29:12.131 --> 00:29:13.475

- An hour?


690
00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:14.626

Ow!

693
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.467
And now Jane's
youngest grandchild, Lara,


694
00:29:22.498 --> 00:29:23.970
will read a poem
she wrote for her


695
00:29:24.002 --> 00:29:26.211
when she was only 10 years old.

696
00:29:26.242 --> 00:29:27.714
Lara.

697
00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:50.467
(sniffing)

698
00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:03.234
Grandma, grandmother.

699
00:30:06.531 --> 00:30:07.747
A mother of two.

700
00:30:09.603 --> 00:30:11.075
A sister to four.

701
00:30:13.922 --> 00:30:15.106
An enemy to none.

702
00:30:18.051 --> 00:30:19.842
A listener to all.

703
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.546
The oceans of love...

704
00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.474
...you bless us all with...

705

...as pure as doves.

707
00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:38.339
And my reason to live.

708
00:30:41.347 --> 00:30:43.746
A magical voice...

709
00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:48.322
that tells tales so great.

710
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:54.723
A voice that is free
of pain and hate.


711
00:30:58.531 --> 00:31:02.050
Her strength is stronger
than an ocean wave.


712
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:07.107
And she is as strong
as she is brave.


713
00:31:10.019 --> 00:31:13.378
Her beauty is so rich

714
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.771
as a river is deep.

715
00:31:16.803 --> 00:31:21.411
Her gentle loving touch
keeps me safe in my sleep.

00:35:03.491 --> 00:35:07.011
I could have been
an actress, a supermodel.


819
00:35:07.043 --> 00:35:09.763
But I just didn't feel
like that was my part,


820
00:35:09.794 --> 00:35:12.321
like, I'm... I'm too much
of a free spirit


821
00:35:12.354 --> 00:35:16.514
to be pinned down
into one tiny little box.


822
00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:17.763
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.


823
00:35:17.795 --> 00:35:19.202
- Yeah.
- Look.


824
00:35:19.234 --> 00:35:20.162
Lara.

825
00:35:20.194 --> 00:35:21.347
Where have you been?

826
00:35:21.379 --> 00:35:23.106
You know,
she's one of my best friends.


827
00:35:23.138 --> 00:35:24.098
Where is Daniel?

828
00:35:24.131 --> 00:35:25.475
I've got to go
to my grandmother's funeral


829
00:35:25.506 --> 00:35:26.914
and we're late, okay,
where is he?


830
00:35:26.946 --> 00:35:28.898
Fuck me, I didn't need
to hear that.


831
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:30.979
Daniel. Where is he?

832
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:33.155
He went into the back bathroom
with Tommy.


833
00:35:33.186 --> 00:35:35.490
- When was that?
- I don't know!

What do you think, Ronnie?

840
00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:49.857
Is it 'cause...
I just don't know,


841
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.850
is it 'cause I got dropped

Where did you go?

890
00:38:48.803 --> 00:38:51.651
Do you not remember
what happened?


891
00:38:51.683 --> 00:38:54.819
- I do.
- Okay, um...


892
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.994
So I spoke to your brother.

893
00:38:57.026 --> 00:38:58.147
We're gonna have
a little gathering


894
00:38:58.178 --> 00:39:00.450
for Daniel at the pub today.

Mm.

896
00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:06.722
Lara, you should be there.

897
00:39:08.867 --> 00:39:10.083
Right.

898
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:23.011

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:27.138

I thought this guy might want
to ride in the back with you.


904
00:40:49.538 --> 00:40:51.266
Oh, Chris.

905
00:40:59.138 --> 00:41:00.450
Bloody hell.

906
00:41:00.483 --> 00:41:03.074
I haven't used this
since Glasto.


907
00:41:03.107 --> 00:41:05.795
It smells of BO and shame.

908
00:41:05.826 --> 00:41:07.715
- Sorry, mate.
- Thanks, babe.


909
00:41:07.746 --> 00:41:10.787
Honestly, anything is better
than being there right now.


910
00:41:10.818 --> 00:41:11.651
Well, look, you can...

911
00:41:11.682 --> 00:41:13.731
you can stay here
as long as you want.

- Nailed it, babe.


915
00:41:20.098 --> 00:41:21.058
Oh.

916
00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:22.274
You can stay
as long as you want,


917
00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:24.066
make yourself at home.

918
00:41:24.098 --> 00:41:27.203
All are loved and welcomed
at Lady Lara's Towers.


919
00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:29.346
If only my actual mother
felt the same way.


920
00:41:31.682 --> 00:41:32.515
Well, I would talk to her, babe,

921
00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:35.747
but she hates me
and she wants me dead,


922
00:41:35.778 --> 00:41:37.634
so, probably wouldn't help.

923
00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:38.723
She doesn't hate you, babe,

924
00:41:38.754 --> 00:41:42.498
she just lives
on another planet.


925
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:43.554
She finds it easier
to blame you


926
00:41:43.587 --> 00:41:47.234
for the things she doesn't
understand about me.


927
00:41:47.267 --> 00:41:50.274
Well, what happened?
What was it this time?


928
00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:53.283
She found something
in my room and kicked off.


929
00:41:53.314 --> 00:41:55.170
Fuck. What?

930
00:41:55.203 --> 00:41:57.922
It doesn't matter.

931
00:41:57.954 --> 00:42:00.451
Anyway...

932
00:42:00.482 --> 00:42:04.482
She was going through my stuff
and I freaked out.


933
00:42:04.514 --> 00:42:07.138
And she said the usual

934
00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:08.354
"when you're under my roof"
crap,


935
00:42:08.387 --> 00:42:12.131
and I just snapped.

936
00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:13.091
(sighs)

937
00:42:13.122 --> 00:42:14.274
Kind of told her to fuck off,

938
00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:17.795
which made things worse,
obviously.


939
00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:18.786
Then, before I knew it,

940
00:42:18.818 --> 00:42:23.747
we were just screaming
in each other's faces.


941
00:42:23.778 --> 00:42:25.506
Saying all sorts.

942
00:42:27.874 --> 00:42:28.803
(sighs)

943
00:42:28.834 --> 00:42:31.427
Then she kicked me out. Again.

944
00:42:33.122 --> 00:42:35.394
Motherly love, eh?

945
00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:37.922
You know, she'd rather see
her own son on the street


946
00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.682
than to...

947
00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:43.138
...than to actually accept me.

948
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:48.322
She loves... she bloody loves you,
Daniel, yeah?


949
00:42:48.355 --> 00:42:50.883
But you said it yourself, like,
she's from another planet.


950
00:42:50.914 --> 00:42:53.859
She's from another universe.

951
00:42:53.891 --> 00:42:56.162
And it will blow over,
it always does.


952
00:42:56.195 --> 00:42:59.171
You'll be hidin' treats
under your bed in no time.


953
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.962
I don't know, babe.

954
00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:02.722
This time I...

955
00:43:02.755 --> 00:43:04.354
(sighs)

956
00:43:04.386 --> 00:43:05.826
I've never...

957
00:43:08.642 --> 00:43:11.458
The things I said.

958
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.418
The things she said.

959
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.986
The way she...

960
00:43:16.386 --> 00:43:17.763
The way she looked at me.

961
00:43:21.603 --> 00:43:23.938
I'm worried this time, Lara.

962
00:43:25.026 --> 00:43:26.307
Feels different, you know?

963
00:43:26.338 --> 00:43:31.746
Look, families
are shite bags, Dan.


964
00:43:31.778 --> 00:43:33.794
I know that.

965
00:43:33.826 --> 00:43:38.883
But it will be all right,
it always is in the end.


966
00:43:38.914 --> 00:43:43.779
Just exhausted, babe,
of hoping and hiding.


967
00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:46.338
I'm... I'm fucking tired of it.

968
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:48.066
I could honestly sleep
for a month.


969
00:43:48.098 --> 00:43:50.466
This family shit is...

970
00:43:50.499 --> 00:43:51.426
(groans)

971
00:43:51.459 --> 00:43:53.795
Look, we are family.

972
00:43:53.826 --> 00:43:55.522
I am family.

973
00:43:55.555 --> 00:43:57.826
And with me,
you don't have to hide,


974
00:43:57.858 --> 00:43:59.555
you don't have to change,

975
00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:02.658
you just have to be you,
all right?


976
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:04.834
And you are not alone.

977
00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:05.859
You hear me?

978
00:44:05.891 --> 00:44:08.226
(sighs)

979
00:44:08.258 --> 00:44:09.507
I didn't realize
I've booked a session


980
00:44:09.538 --> 00:44:12.194
with Jeremy Kyle's

Sorry.

1305
01:00:16.354 --> 01:00:17.218
I thought
this little dickhead


1306
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.722
might want to ride
in the back with you.

01:00:24.674 --> 01:00:26.019
No, that's well out.

1313
01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:27.907
And action.

1314
01:00:27.939 --> 01:00:30.371
I thought this wanker might want
to ride in the back with you.

01:00:46.082 --> 01:00:48.642
her greatest achievement was me.

1320
01:00:48.674 --> 01:00:50.019
Oh.

1321
01:00:50.051 --> 01:00:53.250
Something about tunes, guitars.

1322
01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:55.106
Look, if I'm honest, it's...

it always has been Danny.

fuckin' said it.

1326
01:01:01.794 --> 01:01:04.355
It's shit because, well,

Uh, I think you said
something about talking...
