Today is best day ever‎.

2
00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:51.725
Moving Day‎!

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:53.431
For who‎?

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:55.976
Answer: The Boov‎.

5
00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.315
Who are the Boov‎?

6
00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:01.653
Answer: Best species ever at running away‎.

7
00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:05.115
All Boov settlers‎, please report
to your assigned transport‎.


8
00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:06.574
You are allowed one carry‎-on‎.

9
00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:08.580
Excusing me‎. Sorries‎.

10
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:10.992
Excusing me‎.
Pardon the me‎, friend‎.


11
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.660
Boov do not friend‎.

12
00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:13.789
Owpain‎!

13
00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:14.953
Uh‎-oh‎. Sorries‎.

14
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.794
Who am I‎?
I am Oh‎.


15
00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:21.130
I has been given this name
by my many‎, many friends‎.


16
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.629
‎- Good morning‎!
‎- Oh‎.


17
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:24.921
‎- Hi‎, guys‎.
‎- Oh‎.


18
00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:26.088
‎- Hello‎.
‎- Oh‎.


19
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.019
I am very excitement
to make a new fresh start‎!


20
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:38.482
We are all moving to best planet ever
for to hiding‎.


21
00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:40.778
Our new home‎!

22
00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:54.375
Captain Smek‎!

23
00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.043
My fellow Boov‎!

24
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.958
I has saved us again‎.

25
00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:03.542
A bit lower‎.

26
00:02:03.668 --> 00:02:04.715
No‎, stop‎!

27
00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:05.879
Up a bit‎. Up a bit‎.

28
00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:08.299
Perfect‎. Walk away‎. Walk away‎.

29
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:09.717
My fellow‎.‎.‎.

30
00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:11.718
My‎.‎.‎.

31
00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:13.553
fellow‎.‎.‎.

32
00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:16.348
Boov‎.

33
00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:19.976
Good news‎!

34
00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.729
Thanks to my leadership skills‎.‎.‎.

35
00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.740
cowering‎, running
and pulling a skedaddle‎.‎.‎.


36
00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.572
we are safe from our enemy‎.‎.‎.

37
00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.077
the Gorg‎.

38
00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:33.990
Nasty‎.

39
00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:40.338
Give Daddy some sugar‎!

40
00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:43.000
Captain Smek has saved us again‎!

41
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:47.922
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way‎.


42
00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.591
And the Gorg are lactose intolerant‎.

43
00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:52.430
Genius‎!

44
00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:54.936
They will never find us here‎.

45
00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:56.434
Thank you‎!

46
00:02:57.764 --> 00:02:58.936
Best of yet‎.‎.‎.

47
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.443
this planet is full of great stuff‎.

48
00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:05.276
Look at these delicious fruits‎!

49
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.701
That makes me feel so good‎.

50
00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:13.538
What fun at a party‎!

51
00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:15.119
Boov do not party‎.

52
00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:17.542
Also‎, this planet is inhabited‎.

53
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:18.873
But do not worry‎.

54
00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:22.460
The native savages are
simple and backwards‎.


55
00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.257
They are so ugly‎, they are cute‎!

56
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:32.219
Everything you need to know about them
can be found‎.‎.‎.


57
00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:34.384
in these comprehensive pamphlets‎.

58
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:36.974
Comprehensive pamphlet‎.
Comprehensive pamphlet‎.


59
00:03:37.137 --> 00:03:39.481
They are lucky the Boov have come‎.

60
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.313
All right‎, Boov‎. 
Invade on three‎.

61
00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:43.567
One‎, two‎, three‎.

62
00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:54.822
Rejoice‎, humanspeople‎!
The Boov are arrived‎!


63
00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:57.616
Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily‎.‎.‎.


64
00:03:57.782 --> 00:04:01.252
so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier‎.


65
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.913
And more fun‎!

66
00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.797
So‎, what is up‎?

67
00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:06.382
You are‎!

68
00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:22.732
You'll never catch me‎!

69
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.071
Enjoy you the frozen‎, sweetened
bovine secretion‎.‎.‎.


70
00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.233
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown‎.


71
00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.427
This is so cool‎! Come on‎!

72
00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:55.097
Fa‎-da‎!

73
00:04:55.256 --> 00:05:00.183
Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown‎.


74
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.142
Welcome to your new home‎.

75
00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:04.228
‎- Wait‎, what‎? No‎!
‎- New home‎?


76
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.985
And rest of planet is for Boov‎.

77
00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:08.315
Win‎-win‎!

78
00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:14.735
Welcome‎, Boov settlers‎.

79
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.995
All humans have been relocated‎.

80
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:18.780
Your homes are now ready‎.

81
00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:20.290
Thanking you‎!

82
00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:26.876
This planet may be
a bit of a fixing‎-it‎-upper‎.‎.‎.


83
00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:28.290
but that is okay‎.

84
00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:32.007
Boov are best at deciding what is useful‎.

85
00:05:32.168 --> 00:05:33.420
And what is not‎.

86
00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:35.838
Owpain‎.

87
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:38.174
Step aside‎. 
Clean‎-up crew‎.

88
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:39.467
Useless‎.

89
00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:50.771
Today‎, I starts a new life‎.

90
00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:54.157
With new friends‎. 
In a new home‎.

91
00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:58.620
Residents may now enter sector 179‎.

92
00:05:58.778 --> 00:05:59.779
That is me‎!

93
00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:04.326
And that is why
today is best day ever‎!

94
00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:26.518
Welcome home‎, neighbors‎!

95
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:28.649
Boov do not have "neighbors‎."

96
00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:32.897
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet‎.


97
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.325
Hey‎! Can I borrowing a cup of sugar‎?

98
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:40.703
What‎?

99
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.125
But now‎, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship‎.


100
00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:47.122
You are all invited‎.‎.‎.

101
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:49.413
to my warming of house party‎.

102
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.674
Say‎, 5:00‎?

103
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.084
Sure‎.

104
00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:55.834
Yes‎!

105
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.203
Hey‎, Pig‎! 
Be careful up there‎!

106
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.320
I'm sorry‎, Pig‎.

107
00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:06.952
Mom's not here‎.

108
00:08:07.115 --> 00:08:08.241
It's just a video‎.

109
00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:11.127
Hey‎, Mom‎.
I think Pig wants to join us‎.


110
00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.247
It's not funny‎!

111
00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:14.955
Tip‎!

112
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.958
Come on‎, Mom‎.
It's just snow‎.


113
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.593
I don't know anything about snow‎.

114
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:21.254
We're from Barbados‎!
We don't have snow‎!


115
00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:25.132
Are you okay‎?

116
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.927
I'm sending this to everyone‎.

117
00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:46.530
Sector 195 is ready for occupation‎.

118
00:08:48.198 --> 00:08:50.451
We can't wait for Mom‎, Pig‎.
We gotta go‎.


119
00:08:51.117 --> 00:08:52.117
Right now‎!

120
00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:22.981
Oh‎, no‎!

121
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:32.417
Prepare for your dance attack‎!

122
00:09:53.054 --> 00:09:55.182
Okay‎, let's go find Mom‎.

123
00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:30.220
Neighbors‎, hello‎!

124
00:10:32.385 --> 00:10:34.137
Please come in and‎.‎.‎.

125
00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:40.022
Hello‎.

126
00:10:43.563 --> 00:10:44.563
Hello‎?

127
00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:23.145
And right‎. And left‎. 
Other left‎.

128
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.403
Kyle‎!

129
00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:27.147
Right‎. No‎, left‎.

130
00:11:27.273 --> 00:11:28.991
Hello‎, friend Kyle‎.

131
00:11:30.026 --> 00:11:31.448
I am not your friend‎.

132
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:34.660
Of course you are‎.
We have had many enjoyable talks‎.


133
00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.997
No‎, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move‎.


134
00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:40.503
You are always saying the funny things‎.

135
00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:44.461
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight‎.


136
00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:48.879
I will not‎. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time‎.


137
00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:51.798
Since you are at your busyness‎,
I shall send an e‎-vite to you‎.‎.‎.


138
00:11:51.964 --> 00:11:54.183
so you can join later
during your leisure minute‎.


139
00:11:54.342 --> 00:11:56.470
Please do not send‎.
I enjoy my leisure minute‎.


140
00:11:56.636 --> 00:11:59.640
Fa‎-da‎! I have sent directions
to my living space‎.


141
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.359
Fa‎-da‎! I have sent directions
to my living space‎.


142
00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:07.898
You sent directions to everyone‎?

143
00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:10.362
What‎?
It is not my fault‎.


144
00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:14.453
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"‎?


145
00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:16.121
This is just bad design‎.

146
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.330
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy‎!


147
00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:21.827
Uh‎-oh‎.

148
00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:23.587
"Uh‎-oh" is right‎!

149
00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:26.215
Our enemy‎, the Gorg‎, will receive it‎.‎.‎.

150
00:12:26.374 --> 00:12:28.968
and can use directions for to find us‎!

151
00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:30.424
The Gorg‎?

152
00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:39.391
Fa‎-da‎!

153
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.979
You have doomed our species‎!

154
00:12:45.143 --> 00:12:45.939
No‎, please‎.

155
00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:48.275
I did not mean to‎.
I am sorries‎!


156
00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:49.985
You are arresting‎!

157
00:12:50.148 --> 00:12:51.320
No‎!

158
00:12:51.482 --> 00:12:53.155
I was just trying
to invite you to my‎.‎.‎.

159
00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:58.163
Security has been compromised‎.

160
00:12:58.322 --> 00:13:00.040
Arrest that Boov‎!

161
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.541
Autopilot‎, I needs help‎!

162
00:13:03.703 --> 00:13:07.048
Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters‎.


163
00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:09.550
No‎, Autopilot‎!
Any place but Paris‎!


164
00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:12.053
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs‎.


165
00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:16.053
The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica‎.


166
00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:19.139
Group hug‎!

167
00:13:21.304 --> 00:13:24.057
Yes‎! Antarctica is perfect‎!
Take me there now‎!


168
00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:28.019
I am sorry‎. 
You are fugitive Boov‎.

169
00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:29.688
Initiating Self‎
-Destruct‎.

170
00:13:29.854 --> 00:13:31.527
No‎! Do not initiate‎!

171
00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:32.986
I am not a fugitive‎!

172
00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:49.414
No‎!

173
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:12.863
Oh‎, no‎.

174
00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:31.688
Gotcha‎, gotcha‎, gotcha‎!

175
00:15:33.853 --> 00:15:35.446
Whatfor are you did this‎?

176
00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:38.700
I am Boov‎, beloved by all humans‎.

177
00:15:38.858 --> 00:15:40.360
I know what you are‎.

178
00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.029
Excellent‎! Can I come into the out now‎?

179
00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:45.618
No‎, you cannot "come into the out" now‎.

180
00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:48.159
You can never come into the out‎,
ever again‎!


181
00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:50.336
But I can‎!

182
00:15:50.494 --> 00:15:53.373
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood‎.


183
00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:57.047
Then I will have to‎.‎.‎.

184
00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:01.385
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs‎!


185
00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:03.808
You can do that‎?

186
00:16:05.134 --> 00:16:06.681
Yes‎.

187
00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.894
If you shoot your eye lasers‎,
then I'll have no choice‎.‎.‎.


188
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.562
but to explode your head‎!

189
00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:18.481
‎- You humans cannot to explode‎.‎.‎.
‎- We can too‎!


190
00:16:18.648 --> 00:16:19.991
We just don't much‎.

191
00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:21.366
It's considered rude‎.

192
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:25.492
Then I am granting you a truce‎.

193
00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:27.657
You are not to exploding heads‎.‎.‎.

194
00:16:27.823 --> 00:16:30.747
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers‎.


195
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:35.877
Okay‎. Truce‎.

196
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.758
‎- So‎, can I come into the out now‎?
‎- No‎!


197
00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:41.842
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people‎.


198
00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:43.597
You are thinking a mistake‎.

199
00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:46.054
Boov do not steal and abduct‎.

200
00:16:46.217 --> 00:16:49.061
No‎, Boov liberate and befriend‎.

201
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.603
Guess who made this one‎!

202
00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.518
This is so beautiful‎!

203
00:16:57.353 --> 00:16:59.355
Mom‎! What's happening‎?

204
00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:00.614
I don't know‎, honey‎.

205
00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:04.275
Tip‎!

206
00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:06.620
It will be okay‎.

207
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:12.911
Lifeform detected‎. Not human‎.
Move along‎.


208
00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:15.796
Enjoy you the frozen‎, sweetened
bovine secretion‎.‎.‎.


209
00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:18.299
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown‎.


210
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:20.133
Mom‎!

211
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:25.594
It's all your fault‎.

212
00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.929
You stole my mom‎!

213
00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.807
Smell ya later‎, Boov‎.

214
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.597
Wait‎! Smell me now‎!

215
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.150
I can to fixing your car‎.
I seen you has broken it‎.


216
00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:38.982
I didn't break it‎.
I'm a very good driver‎.


217
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:41.614
It's supposed to leak like that‎.

218
00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:57.964
Can I come into the out now‎?

219
00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:04.008
I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible‎.‎.‎.


220
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.344
yet unintentionally humorous mistakes‎.

221
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:10.760
But let me reassure you‎,
the signal he broadcast‎.‎.‎.


222
00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:12.143
is being handled‎.

223
00:18:12.303 --> 00:18:15.682
We are definitely not doomed‎.

224
00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:18.981
‎- And we're out‎.
‎- We are doomed‎!


225
00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:21.312
The Gorg are going to find us again‎!

226
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:23.698
The maniac Boov has ruined everything‎.

227
00:18:23.856 --> 00:18:25.950
This is bad‎.

228
00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:31.326
And I really love this planet‎.

229
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:33.742
Look at all the great stuff they've got‎.

230
00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:37.161
Like this‎! A headband‎!

231
00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:40.377
And for evening wear‎, you slide it down‎.‎.‎.

232
00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.257
you got a beautiful spare tire‎.

233
00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:43.416
I love it‎!

234
00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:44.714
Very nice‎!

235
00:18:44.877 --> 00:18:47.505
Who would wanna leave this behind‎?
I have got to fix this‎.


236
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.006
I know‎!

237
00:18:49.173 --> 00:18:51.175
Summon the Big Brain Boovs‎.

238
00:18:51.342 --> 00:18:53.515
The smarty‎-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness‎.


239
00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:55.596
Gentleboov‎.‎.‎.

240
00:18:55.763 --> 00:18:57.561
I want ideas‎.

241
00:18:59.975 --> 00:19:02.603
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it‎.‎.‎.


242
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.522
then go live there‎.

243
00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:06.907
Yes‎! I love it‎!

244
00:19:07.066 --> 00:19:08.318
How long would that take‎?

245
00:19:08.484 --> 00:19:10.486
Based on our current technology‎.‎.‎.

246
00:19:12.404 --> 00:19:14.031
1‎.7 million years‎.

247
00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:16.951
That's a lot of years‎, Toni‎.
Moving on‎!


248
00:19:17.117 --> 00:19:19.165
‎- We could lay on the ground‎.‎.‎.
‎- Yes‎!


249
00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:22.502
And make the Gorg think we are dead‎.

250
00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:26.760
Next‎!

251
00:19:27.503 --> 00:19:29.847
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email‎.‎.‎.


252
00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:31.302
and cancelled his e‎-vite‎.‎.‎.

253
00:19:31.465 --> 00:19:34.935
Shush‎! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email‎.‎.‎.


254
00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:37.813
and cancel his invitation‎, and‎.‎.‎.

255
00:19:38.264 --> 00:19:39.060
What was that‎?

256
00:19:39.223 --> 00:19:40.770
So the Gorg never receive it‎.

257
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:43.269
So the Gorg never receive it‎!

258
00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:47.406
Now‎, type in the password
and cancel that message‎.


259
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:51.035
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password‎."


260
00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:52.285
It's so easy to remember‎.

261
00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:57.542
It did not work‎! 
His password is unique‎.

262
00:19:58.158 --> 00:19:58.954
No‎!

263
00:19:59.118 --> 00:20:02.497
Unique‎?
Boov are not unique‎!


264
00:20:03.914 --> 00:20:05.166
Fetch me my inhaler‎.

265
00:20:11.422 --> 00:20:13.049
Boy‎, that works‎.

266
00:20:13.215 --> 00:20:15.468
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us‎.


267
00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:16.806
Show me his invite‎.

268
00:20:18.178 --> 00:20:20.431
You are all invited to a party‎!

269
00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:21.770
Just head to the Milky Way‎.

270
00:20:21.932 --> 00:20:23.184
Turn right at the Big Dipper‎.

271
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.647
Third planet from the Sun‎.

272
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.154
Look for my balloons‎!
Party‎!


273
00:20:27.897 --> 00:20:29.945
Come if you like to have fun‎!

274
00:20:30.107 --> 00:20:31.950
My best friend Kyle will be there‎!

275
00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:33.827
Kyle‎, Kyle‎, Kyle‎!

276
00:20:34.236 --> 00:20:35.236
Come party‎!

277
00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:37.535
Kyle‎!

278
00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.746
He is not my friend‎.

279
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:42.037
The internet does not lie‎!

280
00:20:42.202 --> 00:20:43.920
You know him‎, you can find him‎.

281
00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.581
I am putting you in charge‎!

282
00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:48.388
But‎, Captain‎, it is not my job‎.
I am only a mid‎-level traffic Boov‎.


283
00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:50.719
‎- I admire your cowardice‎, Officer‎.
‎- Thank you‎.


284
00:20:50.878 --> 00:20:55.179
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city‎.


285
00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:56.929
We need his password‎.‎.‎.

286
00:20:57.092 --> 00:21:00.312
or we will all
be destroyed by the Gorg‎!

287
00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:01.471
Find him‎!

288
00:21:01.513 --> 00:21:05.643
That Boov has made his final mistake‎.

289
00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:06.977
Fa‎-da‎!

290
00:21:07.144 --> 00:21:08.896
You were supposed to fix it‎!

291
00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:10.189
What is this‎?

292
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:12.450
I calls it "Slushious‎."

293
00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:34.087
"Slushious"‎?

294
00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:35.472
It makes excellent fuel‎.‎.‎.

295
00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:37.258
and comes in fun‎-to‎-say flavors‎.

296
00:21:37.675 --> 00:21:38.675
"Grape Escape‎."

297
00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:39.931
"Tangerine Twist‎."

298
00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:41.346
"Busta Lime"‎!

299
00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:43.681
Mom's gonna kill me‎.

300
00:21:43.847 --> 00:21:48.819
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude‎.


301
00:21:48.978 --> 00:21:52.323
Actually‎, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose‎. Hold still‎.


302
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:54.700
No‎! Your gratitude is implied‎.

303
00:21:57.236 --> 00:21:58.453
You can drives first‎.

304
00:21:58.612 --> 00:21:59.989
Then I can‎.‎.‎.

305
00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:01.327
You're not coming‎.

306
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.993
I'm trying to hide from the Boov‎.
I'm not bringing one with me‎.


307
00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.376
You'll just turn me in‎.

308
00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:07.584
No‎! I just needs a ride‎!

309
00:22:07.746 --> 00:22:10.920
I haves official Boov business
out of in town‎.


310
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.083
Me‎, too‎.

311
00:22:12.793 --> 00:22:14.261
But I fixes your car‎!

312
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.639
So‎? I let you out of the freezer‎.
We're even‎.


313
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.779
‎- What did you do to my car‎?
‎- What doos you mean‎?


314
00:22:32.938 --> 00:22:34.406
It should to hover much better now‎.

315
00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:37.409
It's a car‎.
It didn't hover at all before‎.


316
00:22:38.444 --> 00:22:40.117
How do you stop this thing‎?

317
00:22:51.957 --> 00:22:56.463
Oops‎. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti‎-proceed controls‎.


318
00:22:56.628 --> 00:22:59.006
Yeah‎, I noticed‎.
Stop is go‎.


319
00:22:59.715 --> 00:23:00.967
‎- Go is stop‎.
‎- Wait‎!


320
00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:04.307
Whyfor you do this‎?
Boovs and humans are friends‎!


321
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.893
We're not friends‎.
You kidnapped my mom‎!


322
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.152
Who is Mimom‎?

323
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:13.403
No‎, "my" mom‎!

324
00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:14.905
What did I say‎?

325
00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:21.487
‎- I knows how to find her‎.
‎- How‎?


326
00:23:21.653 --> 00:23:24.202
That information is at
Boov Central Command‎.


327
00:23:24.364 --> 00:23:26.037
‎- At the Great Antenna‎.
‎- What‎?


328
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.453
In Paris‎! Now let me to inside‎!

329
00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:29.745
Paris‎.

330
00:23:31.413 --> 00:23:32.915
‎- Then promise‎.
‎- What‎?


331
00:23:33.082 --> 00:23:35.676
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt‎.


332
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:41.424
I promise‎! But if you do not wish
to be capturing‎, it must be now‎!


333
00:23:45.844 --> 00:23:47.187
Fine‎. Get in‎.

334
00:24:06.115 --> 00:24:09.085
Oui‎, oui‎, Pig‎!
Paris‎, here we come‎.


335
00:24:09.785 --> 00:24:11.913
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom‎.


336
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:34.568
Okay‎. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris‎.


337
00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:39.403
Destination entered: Antarctica‎.

338
00:24:39.898 --> 00:24:41.150
Hey‎, what are you doing‎?

339
00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:43.281
How did that happen‎?

340
00:24:43.443 --> 00:24:46.117
Keep your Boov paws off my car‎!

341
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:48.786
Whoa‎!

342
00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:52.541
Your vehicle is infested‎.

343
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:55.627
It's not infested‎. 
He's my pet‎.

344
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:58.133
His name is Pig‎. 
Don't touch him‎.

345
00:24:58.292 --> 00:24:59.794
Now he is vibrating‎.

346
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.553
Is he going to explode‎?

347
00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:03.714
No‎! He's just purring‎.

348
00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:05.178
Why do you haves this thing‎?

349
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.469
Is it useful‎? 
Does it give meat or milk‎?

350
00:25:08.635 --> 00:25:10.308
What‎? No‎!

351
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.815
You just have pets for fun
and companionship‎.


352
00:25:13.974 --> 00:25:16.568
You has me for companion on the ship‎.

353
00:25:16.727 --> 00:25:18.855
Yeah‎, well‎, 
Pig is better‎.

354
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:24.489
If cat is "Pig‎," what is your name‎?

355
00:25:36.538 --> 00:25:39.337
Gratuity Tucci‎.
But my friends call me "Tip‎."


356
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.344
‎- Tip‎.
‎- I said "my friends‎."


357
00:25:42.502 --> 00:25:45.506
But we are friends‎.
All humans and Boov‎.


358
00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:47.174
Captain Smek has decided‎.

359
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:48.433
Captain Smek is an idiot‎.

360
00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:50.348
Untrue‎!

361
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.390
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away‎.


362
00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:58.186
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher‎?


363
00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:02.606
Long ago‎, our enemy‎, the Gorg‎.‎.‎.

364
00:26:02.773 --> 00:26:05.447
invited the Boov to a peace meeting‎.

365
00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:14.668
But Smek wisely fled in terror‎.

366
00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:17.670
And he took a great trophy: the Shusher‎.

367
00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:19.046
Run away‎!

368
00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:23.006
Why is it called the "Shusher"‎?

369
00:26:23.794 --> 00:26:24.794
Shush‎!

370
00:26:25.796 --> 00:26:27.013
Whatever‎.

371
00:27:06.795 --> 00:27:08.012
Seriously‎?

372
00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:09.891
You guys had to
ruin the Statue Of Liberty‎?

373
00:27:10.048 --> 00:27:11.048
"Statue of Smek‎."

374
00:27:11.174 --> 00:27:13.017
You will not get away with this‎.

375
00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:14.427
Boov Patrol‎!

376
00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:15.725
They are looking for you‎!

377
00:27:15.887 --> 00:27:16.887
Oh‎, no‎.

378
00:27:32.237 --> 00:27:33.237
Oh‎, no‎!

379
00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:35.998
What's that‎?

380
00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:41.037
Hey‎!

381
00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:43.507
Don't distract the driver‎!

382
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.593
Aha‎! Busta Lime‎.

383
00:27:56.053 --> 00:27:57.475
"Busta Lime‎."

384
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.731
Owpain‎!

385
00:28:03.894 --> 00:28:04.941
Owpain‎.

386
00:28:20.702 --> 00:28:21.828
Okay‎. Pee break‎.

387
00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:23.372
I‎, too‎, has to break pee‎.

388
00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:25.131
Or‎, as you calls it‎, the "number one‎."

389
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.292
‎- We also has the "number two‎."
‎- Okay‎.


390
00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:29.336
‎- And the "number three‎."
‎- Okay‎!


391
00:28:29.503 --> 00:28:31.551
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three‎.


392
00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:33.340
It would not be safe for you‎.

393
00:28:34.257 --> 00:28:35.884
We only doos it once a year‎.

394
00:28:36.051 --> 00:28:37.428
I would not call it a holiday‎.‎.‎.

395
00:28:37.594 --> 00:28:40.063
‎- but you doos need to take the day off‎.
‎- That's enough‎!


396
00:28:42.182 --> 00:28:45.152
You can't come in here‎.
This is the girls' room‎.


397
00:28:54.903 --> 00:28:56.576
Do not eat the blue mints‎!

398
00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:01.919
Thankfully‎, there is a
large bowl of lemonade‎.


399
00:29:04.413 --> 00:29:06.632
Do not drink the lemonade‎!

400
00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:10.419
Be out in a second‎.

401
00:29:10.585 --> 00:29:13.179
We're going to Paris‎!

402
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:15.973
Going to see my mom‎!

403
00:29:19.052 --> 00:29:20.520
Takes your time‎!

404
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:28.023
Ant‎-arc‎-tica‎.

405
00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:30.356
Here I come‎!

406
00:29:30.522 --> 00:29:31.522
Fugitive Boov‎.

407
00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:34.034
Hold still for arresting‎!

408
00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:35.694
Best friend Kyle‎!

409
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:37.204
I am not your friend‎!

410
00:29:37.362 --> 00:29:39.911
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password‎.


411
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:44.995
Yes‎! You has in nick‎-time saved us‎!

412
00:29:47.497 --> 00:29:49.170
What is the purpose of your face‎?

413
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.626
Owpain‎.

414
00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:52.214
You were gonna ditch me‎?

415
00:29:52.377 --> 00:29:53.377
‎- No‎!
‎- Liar‎!


416
00:29:53.503 --> 00:29:54.880
I never lie‎!

417
00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:56.046
Yes‎, you do‎!

418
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:57.512
And you know how I know‎?

419
00:29:57.674 --> 00:30:01.053
Because every time you lie‎,
you turn green‎!


420
00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:02.721
I doos not‎. I‎.‎.‎.

421
00:30:03.388 --> 00:30:04.388
Poomp‎.

422
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.572
Open the door‎, you lying‎,
frog‎-faced squishy toy‎!


423
00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:13.315
Stop‎! I need your‎.‎.‎.

424
00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:17.327
You promised to help me find my mom‎!

425
00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:18.988
Then I un‎-promise‎!

426
00:30:19.154 --> 00:30:20.701
That's not how it works‎!

427
00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:23.451
You have to help me get to Paris‎.

428
00:30:23.617 --> 00:30:25.460
I will not‎!

429
00:30:27.496 --> 00:30:28.964
Stop‎! I need your‎.‎.‎.

430
00:30:34.127 --> 00:30:35.174
I must hide‎!

431
00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:38.307
I am speaking the English at you‎.
Whyfor do you not understands me‎?


432
00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:41.594
I "understands‎." I just don't care‎.

433
00:30:42.344 --> 00:30:43.470
‎- Freezing‎!
‎- Look out‎!


434
00:30:52.062 --> 00:30:53.062
Come on‎!

435
00:30:55.273 --> 00:30:58.868
Stop‎! I need your password‎.

436
00:31:02.113 --> 00:31:02.784
No‎!

437
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:03.948
Go‎!

438
00:31:22.342 --> 00:31:24.845
All I wanted was his password‎.

439
00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:32.395
This is not a sustainable friendship model‎.

440
00:31:58.044 --> 00:31:59.387
So‎.‎.‎.

441
00:31:59.546 --> 00:32:04.347
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive‎.


442
00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:06.178
Anybody‎?

443
00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:08.267
You‎. The purple one‎.

444
00:32:10.974 --> 00:32:13.014
Not that purple‎. The other purple‎.
The other purple‎.


445
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:15.561
That one‎.

446
00:32:15.562 --> 00:32:16.562
Yes‎, you‎!

447
00:32:16.938 --> 00:32:18.531
So‎, where is he‎?

448
00:32:18.898 --> 00:32:20.195
We do not know‎, sir‎.

449
00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:22.702
What‎? This is number one disaster‎!

450
00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:25.205
His message must not reach the Gorg‎.

451
00:32:25.363 --> 00:32:28.913
This planet was hard to find‎,
and I will not abandon it‎!


452
00:32:29.075 --> 00:32:32.329
Someone fetch me my stress blankie‎.

453
00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:38.926
So soothing‎.

454
00:32:42.213 --> 00:32:43.931
Aha‎! Officer Kyle‎!

455
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.060
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job‎.


456
00:32:47.218 --> 00:32:49.437
Tell me‎, you have found the fugitive‎?

457
00:32:49.596 --> 00:32:50.768
Yes‎.

458
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.807
Joyful exclamation‎!

459
00:32:55.352 --> 00:32:56.945
And where is he‎?

460
00:32:58.438 --> 00:33:00.486
There is a tiny problem‎.

461
00:33:03.318 --> 00:33:06.492
"Tiny‎." As long as it's tiny‎, who cares‎?

462
00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:09.787
Well‎, before I got the password‎.‎.‎.

463
00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:12.582
I erased him‎.

464
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:19.585
Come party‎. Come party‎. 
Come party‎.

465
00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:25.465
‎- Quit it‎!
‎- Sorry‎.


466
00:33:25.632 --> 00:33:27.760
Look‎, Paris is danger for both of us‎.

467
00:33:27.926 --> 00:33:29.974
It crawls with Boov‎.

468
00:33:30.136 --> 00:33:33.185
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there‎?


469
00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:36.443
Not really‎. 
But I have hope‎.

470
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:38.775
You are bad at math‎.

471
00:33:38.937 --> 00:33:39.688
Excuse me‎?

472
00:33:39.854 --> 00:33:41.606
I got an "A" in geometry‎.

473
00:33:41.773 --> 00:33:43.116
I am only saying‎.‎.‎.

474
00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:45.777
Boov are superior in this way‎.

475
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:50.116
If probability for success
falls below 50%‎.‎.‎.


476
00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:54.332
Boov give up‎. 
You do not‎.

477
00:33:54.494 --> 00:33:55.494
Exactly‎!

478
00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:57.839
Enough with the ripping‎!

479
00:33:57.997 --> 00:33:59.294
Okay‎, Okay‎.

480
00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:01.334
Tell you what‎. 
Let's have some tuneage‎.

481
00:34:08.967 --> 00:34:10.389
What is that‎?

482
00:34:10.552 --> 00:34:12.304
Boov song‎.

483
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.472
It is called "Motionless and Obedient‎."

484
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.639
Very big hit‎.

485
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.984
No‎, no‎, no‎! 
Not in my car‎.

486
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:19.520
Driver gets to pick‎.

487
00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:26.155
This is not even music‎.
This is just noise‎.


488
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:38.167
Involuntary physical response‎.

489
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:41.754
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon‎.


490
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:44.886
If you want humans to not hate you‎.‎.‎.

491
00:34:45.044 --> 00:34:47.422
you could start by liking
some of our stuff‎.


492
00:34:52.427 --> 00:34:55.055
Confusion‎. What is happening to my body‎?

493
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:56.598
It's called dancing‎!

494
00:34:56.765 --> 00:34:58.688
Boov do not dancing‎!

495
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.353
I can tell‎.
But you're getting the hang of it‎!


496
00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.362
How long before this kills me‎?

497
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:06.115
I am not in
control of my own extremities‎!

498
00:35:06.274 --> 00:35:08.402
That's it‎. Work it‎!

499
00:35:08.568 --> 00:35:09.865
I do not want it to work‎!

500
00:35:10.028 --> 00:35:11.028
You know what‎?

501
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.369
"Boov" rhymes with "groove‎."

502
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:15.454
Shake your Boov thang‎.

503
00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:18.207
It is shaking in a most undignified way‎!

504
00:35:19.037 --> 00:35:22.541
Oh‎, no‎! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care‎!


505
00:35:22.874 --> 00:35:24.797
This is not how a Boov behaves‎!

506
00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.586
I am overheated with shame‎!

507
00:35:26.753 --> 00:35:28.551
‎- I must cool my core‎!
‎- Wait‎!


508
00:35:28.713 --> 00:35:31.136
‎- What are you doing‎?
‎- I will returning‎!


509
00:35:31.883 --> 00:35:33.100
We were having fun‎!

510
00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:34.886
Oh‎!

511
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.601
Oh‎?

512
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:53.910
Come on‎, Mom‎. 
It's just snow‎!

513
00:35:54.072 --> 00:35:55.995
I don't know anything about snow‎.

514
00:35:57.075 --> 00:35:58.327
Our first snow‎!

515
00:36:01.579 --> 00:36:02.751
Are you okay‎?

516
00:36:02.914 --> 00:36:04.086
I'm sending this to‎-

517
00:36:05.291 --> 00:36:07.134
My temperature is back to happiness‎.

518
00:36:07.293 --> 00:36:10.593
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge‎-ment‎.‎.‎.


519
00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:13.349
I have brought you delicious snacking‎.

520
00:36:13.508 --> 00:36:15.602
Fa‎-da‎! Chewy plastic rings‎!

521
00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:20.812
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs‎.


522
00:36:20.974 --> 00:36:22.100
Where have you been‎?

523
00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:23.439
You were gone forever‎!

524
00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:25.274
That is not accurate‎. "Forever" is‎.‎.‎.

525
00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:27.655
I thought you were dead‎! Or hurt‎!

526
00:36:27.814 --> 00:36:29.782
Or I don't know‎!

527
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:32.694
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that‎!


528
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:34.829
Put yourself in my shoes‎!

529
00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:36.706
How could I wears your shoes‎?

530
00:36:36.865 --> 00:36:38.162
My pods are too small‎.

531
00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:39.541
It's an expression‎!

532
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:42.955
It means try to feel how
someone else feels‎.


533
00:36:43.121 --> 00:36:47.046
I'm just a kid‎. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time‎.


534
00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:50.963
This is child endangerment‎.
Which is a crime‎, by the way‎.


535
00:36:51.129 --> 00:36:53.632
But when I founded you‎,
you were already alone‎.‎.‎.


536
00:36:53.798 --> 00:36:55.550
so I thinks it is normal for you‎.

537
00:36:55.717 --> 00:36:58.220
When Boov are young‎,
we are kept in the warming oven‎.


538
00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:06.986
Is this normal for humanspersons‎?

539
00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:12.151
Usually‎, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16‎.


540
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.490
No‎, none of this is normal‎!

541
00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:17.531
Don't you get it‎?
You ruined everything‎!


542
00:37:17.697 --> 00:37:21.918
I was finally happy here‎.‎.‎.
There‎, where I lived‎.


543
00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.419
With my mom‎.

544
00:37:23.828 --> 00:37:26.206
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in‎?


545
00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:27.840
How long that took‎?

546
00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:30.172
7th‎-grade girls are mean‎!

547
00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:32.508
Yes‎, I sees that‎!
I did not realize‎!


548
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.015
We will resume the finding of Mimom‎.

549
00:37:36.174 --> 00:37:37.892
Stop saying that‎!

550
00:37:38.051 --> 00:37:40.429
She's just "my" mom‎.

551
00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.689
Not yours‎. Mine‎.

552
00:37:42.847 --> 00:37:45.270
How do you not understand this‎?

553
00:37:45.433 --> 00:37:48.937
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you‎?


554
00:37:50.188 --> 00:37:52.031
That could not to happen‎.

555
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.192
Boov are not having mimoms‎.

556
00:37:55.777 --> 00:37:58.075
Boov don't have families‎.

557
00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:02.208
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else‎.


558
00:38:07.205 --> 00:38:10.049
So‎, your mimom‎.‎.‎.

559
00:38:10.208 --> 00:38:13.052
is a very important humansperson to you‎.

560
00:38:13.211 --> 00:38:15.885
More important than others‎.

561
00:38:16.047 --> 00:38:20.097
To not belong with her
causes you being sad‎.


562
00:38:23.888 --> 00:38:27.392
But recent moments ago‎,
you are kicking on me and yelling‎.


563
00:38:27.558 --> 00:38:31.563
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad‎.


564
00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:35.780
Well‎, sometimes it's both‎.

565
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:40.367
So‎, you are sad‎-mad‎.

566
00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:56.296
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet‎.


567
00:39:03.636 --> 00:39:05.479
I vacuumed here as fast as I could‎.

568
00:39:06.597 --> 00:39:09.271
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password‎?


569
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.772
I got nothing‎!

570
00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:14.064
Please‎, come on‎!
I need ideas‎!


571
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.232
You‎! The purple one‎.

572
00:39:19.152 --> 00:39:20.779
Oh‎, come on‎!

573
00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:22.947
So‎?

574
00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:28.086
We could type in random
numbers and letters‎?


575
00:39:29.162 --> 00:39:30.288
I like it‎!

576
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.130
Get those big brains
plugged in and working‎.


577
00:39:34.292 --> 00:39:35.464
Away‎!

578
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:38.839
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us‎.


579
00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:40.097
Chomp‎, chomp‎, chomp‎.

580
00:39:44.469 --> 00:39:46.767
And that is why
we keep running away‎.


581
00:39:47.305 --> 00:39:48.305
Whoa‎.

582
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:50.354
Why do these Gorg hate you so much‎?

583
00:39:50.516 --> 00:39:51.768
Because they are Gorg‎.

584
00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:54.278
We calls Gorg the "takers"‎.‎.‎.

585
00:39:54.437 --> 00:39:57.657
because if you has something‎,
they takes it‎.


586
00:39:57.815 --> 00:39:59.613
Like‎, if you has a sandwich‎.

587
00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:00.948
Or a planet‎.

588
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.953
No‎, no‎. I get it‎.

589
00:40:03.112 --> 00:40:04.989
But they're not coming
to this planet‎, right‎?


590
00:40:05.156 --> 00:40:06.703
Oh‎, no‎, no‎. 
Not to worry‎.

591
00:40:06.866 --> 00:40:10.166
The Big Brain Boov
will to fix my mistake‎.

592
00:40:10.328 --> 00:40:12.171
But I will still be very punished‎.

593
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.957
We has a rule‎.

594
00:40:14.123 --> 00:40:16.546
Nine mistakes and you are out‎.

595
00:40:16.709 --> 00:40:18.507
How many mistakes do you have‎?

596
00:40:19.212 --> 00:40:20.464
62‎.

597
00:40:24.842 --> 00:40:28.312
When I'm stressed out‎,
my mom tells me jokes‎.


598
00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:31.183
Boov do not do telling jokes‎.

599
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:33.147
It's not that hard‎.
I'll teach you‎.


600
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:34.309
Knock‎, knock‎.

601
00:40:35.478 --> 00:40:37.526
You would say‎, "Who's there‎?"

602
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.029
You are there‎.

603
00:40:41.192 --> 00:40:42.694
No‎, just ask me‎.

604
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860
Who is there‎?

605
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:46.489
Now I say‎, "The interrupting cow‎."

606
00:40:46.656 --> 00:40:49.535
Now you say‎, "The interrupting cow‎, who‎?"

607
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.701
Let's just do it‎.

608
00:40:50.868 --> 00:40:53.166
‎- Knock‎, knock‎.
‎- Who is there‎?


609
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:55.081
The interrupting cow‎.

610
00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:57.671
‎- The interrupting cow‎.‎.‎.
‎- Moo‎!


611
00:40:57.834 --> 00:40:59.882
You did not let me finish my response‎.

612
00:41:00.044 --> 00:41:03.048
‎- I was to say‎, "The interrupting co‎.‎.‎."
‎- Moo‎!


613
00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:04.761
You did it again‎.

614
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:08.724
That is the joke‎.

615
00:41:08.886 --> 00:41:11.730
The cow is to being an interrupting cow‎.‎.‎.

616
00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:13.891
and therefore interrupts me‎!

617
00:41:14.058 --> 00:41:16.356
‎- I know‎. That's why it's funny‎.
‎- Moo‎!


618
00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:18.112
‎- Let me fi‎.‎.‎.
‎- Moo‎!


619
00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:19.991
‎- That's enough‎.
‎- I'm the interrupting cow‎.


620
00:41:20.022 --> 00:41:21.569
‎- Knock it off‎!
‎- Moo‎!


621
00:41:21.732 --> 00:41:23.780
‎- Don't make me get out more tape‎!
‎- Moo‎!


622
00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:34.621
So many Boovs‎!

623
00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:36.748
I said this was dumbness‎.

624
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:39.542
I said I am doomed‎.
But doos you listen‎? No‎!


625
00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:40.709
Oh‎, that's enough‎!

626
00:41:40.751 --> 00:41:42.594
You are driving me to the crazy‎!

627
00:41:42.753 --> 00:41:45.973
It is never too late to run away‎.
That is the Boov motto‎.


628
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:48.935
Yes‎, but we're not doing that‎.
I have a plan‎.


629
00:41:49.093 --> 00:41:52.097
Is your plan to run away‎?
Because other‎-way‎-wise‎, it is stupid‎!


630
00:41:52.263 --> 00:41:54.061
All we have to do
is sneak into the city‎.‎.‎.


631
00:41:54.223 --> 00:41:57.067
get into the Great Antenna‎,
use it to find my mom‎.‎.‎.


632
00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:59.274
and then sneak out again‎. See‎?

633
00:41:59.437 --> 00:42:02.486
But it still will not work
because my face is known‎.


634
00:42:02.648 --> 00:42:07.119
If I am seen by any Boov‎,
I am 100% popular for being arrested‎.


635
00:42:08.779 --> 00:42:10.452
What if I could fix that‎?

636
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.677
Hold still‎.

637
00:42:28.257 --> 00:42:30.806
First‎, a little beauty mark‎.

638
00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:33.138
Letting me see‎.

639
00:42:33.304 --> 00:42:35.544
‎- Not yet‎. Give me that mirror‎.
‎- Give to me‎, give to me‎!


640
00:42:38.142 --> 00:42:41.146
It is like looking at a completed stranger‎!

641
00:42:41.312 --> 00:42:43.280
No‎, I'm not done‎. 
It's not even‎.‎.‎.

642
00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:46.488
You are a worker of
miraculous transformation‎!


643
00:42:46.651 --> 00:42:48.119
Who is this Boov‎?

644
00:42:48.277 --> 00:42:49.699
I do not know‎!

645
00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:52.038
All right‎, Oh‎.

646
00:42:54.492 --> 00:42:55.493
Owpain‎.

647
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.681
Express elevator departing‎.

648
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:31.361
Whoa‎!

649
00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:33.531
This is uber freaky‎.

650
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:36.201
These are the smartest Boov you have‎?

651
00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:38.911
You must be very quiet‎.

652
00:43:39.078 --> 00:43:40.798
You do not want to break their concentra‎.‎.‎.

653
00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:44.758
Come party‎. 
Come party‎.

654
00:43:46.544 --> 00:43:47.591
Oh‎! What is it‎?

655
00:43:47.753 --> 00:43:50.757
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now‎.


656
00:43:50.923 --> 00:43:52.843
But they have still not
figured out my password‎.


657
00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:54.443
‎- How is this possible‎?
‎- Wait a minute‎.


658
00:43:54.593 --> 00:43:57.517
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth'‎?


659
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.102
To Smekland‎, yes‎!

660
00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:00.517
And what happens then‎?

661
00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:05.021
There will be no finding of Mimom‎!

662
00:44:05.938 --> 00:44:07.406
Then you've gotta fix this‎!

663
00:44:07.565 --> 00:44:08.862
Yes‎.

664
00:44:10.234 --> 00:44:11.360
Hurry‎!

665
00:44:11.527 --> 00:44:13.279
By to the way‎, is your skull flexible‎?

666
00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:14.242
‎- What‎?
‎- Never mind‎.


667
00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:15.845
It will be probably okay‎.
Hold still‎.


668
00:44:28.961 --> 00:44:30.133
Wow‎!

669
00:44:34.133 --> 00:44:35.760
30 seconds to doom‎.

670
00:44:35.926 --> 00:44:37.803
I shall input my password‎. 
It is‎.‎.‎.

671
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:42.771
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great
and anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1‎."


672
00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:44.435
I wonder why no one guessed that‎.

673
00:44:44.602 --> 00:44:45.728
I do not know‎.

674
00:44:47.438 --> 00:44:48.985
‎- It didn't work‎?
‎- Impossible‎!


675
00:44:49.148 --> 00:44:50.148
That is password‎!

676
00:44:50.232 --> 00:44:52.405
That is‎.‎.‎.
Oh‎, no‎! Caps Lock‎.


677
00:44:59.784 --> 00:45:00.824
Come on‎, come on‎, come on‎!

678
00:45:00.826 --> 00:45:03.124
Come party‎. Come party‎.
Come party‎. Come party‎.


679
00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:07.424
Come party‎. 
Come party‎.

680
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:20.971
Yes‎!

681
00:45:27.645 --> 00:45:29.647
Fa‎-da‎! It has worked‎.

682
00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:31.111
It worked‎!

683
00:45:31.273 --> 00:45:32.490
You did it‎, Oh‎!

684
00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:37.283
That was closeness‎.

685
00:45:37.446 --> 00:45:38.446
On your feet‎.

686
00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:40.332
You still have to find my mom‎.

687
00:45:40.491 --> 00:45:43.540
That is simplicity‎.
We shall now searching on‎.‎.‎.


688
00:45:43.702 --> 00:45:45.329
Lucy Tucci‎.

689
00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:47.464
"Lucy Tucci‎."

690
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:51.051
Australia‎.

691
00:45:54.505 --> 00:45:56.348
Observe Mimom‎.

692
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.347
That's not funny‎.

693
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.887
This is not your mimom‎?

694
00:46:01.053 --> 00:46:02.053
Are you kidding‎?

695
00:46:02.638 --> 00:46:04.515
That's not her‎!

696
00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:06.066
Sure‎?

697
00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:08.402
I know‎, I know‎. Okay‎?

698
00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:10.081
You've been saying that for two weeks‎.

699
00:46:10.229 --> 00:46:11.230
Please‎!

700
00:46:11.397 --> 00:46:14.901
She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin‎.


701
00:46:15.067 --> 00:46:16.193
Mom‎.

702
00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:18.988
So tell me where she is‎.

703
00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:21.078
Or find me a Boov who can‎.

704
00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:24.493
Please‎.

705
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:28.756
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom‎.

706
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.548
Gratuity Tucci‎? 
Whyfor‎.‎.‎.

707
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.680
Thank you‎! Thank you‎,
thank you‎, thank you‎, thank you‎!


708
00:46:41.552 --> 00:46:44.226
I can't believe it‎!
My mom's in Australia‎!


709
00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:46.766
And I has cancelled my e‎-vite‎!

710
00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:48.934
I can finally come out of the hiding‎.

711
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.102
Yes‎!

712
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:03.290
Well‎, well‎, well‎.

713
00:47:05.618 --> 00:47:06.710
Hello‎?

714
00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:08.537
Hold my crown‎.

715
00:47:08.704 --> 00:47:10.706
And be very careful‎.
It's the only one‎.


716
00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:13.042
Well‎, well‎, well‎.

717
00:47:13.876 --> 00:47:16.129
Did you really think you could escape‎?

718
00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:19.640
Escape‎? No‎, no‎, no‎.

719
00:47:19.798 --> 00:47:21.141
You see‎, I was
just coming to tell you‎.‎.‎.

720
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.553
Despite your elaborate disguise‎.‎.‎.

721
00:47:24.094 --> 00:47:26.768
the computer recognized you as‎.‎.‎.

722
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:29.275
the fugitive Boov‎!

723
00:47:33.479 --> 00:47:34.901
But he's a hero Boov now‎!

724
00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:37.658
Yes‎! I has fixed my mistake‎!

725
00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:40.444
Yes‎, but before that‎,
you has made your mistake‎.


726
00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:42.830
And many mistakes before that‎.

727
00:47:42.988 --> 00:47:46.288
‎- Wait‎, I have not‎.‎.‎.
‎- Many‎, many‎, many‎, many‎!


728
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.450
Actually‎.‎.‎.

729
00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:49.795
Many mistakes before that‎.

730
00:47:50.496 --> 00:47:52.464
‎- So‎, I still has to erase you‎.
‎- Why‎?


731
00:47:52.623 --> 00:47:54.823
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again‎.


732
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:57.803
‎- But I would not‎.
‎- But you might‎.


733
00:47:57.962 --> 00:47:58.758
But I would not‎.

734
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.343
We could go round and round‎.
Let's do it again‎!


735
00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:01.632
‎- But I would not‎.
‎- But you might‎.


736
00:48:01.799 --> 00:48:03.597
‎- But I would not‎.
‎- I love this‎!


737
00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:07.763
‎- But I would not‎!
‎- Bored now‎.


738
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.977
‎- But I would‎.‎.‎.
‎- Shush‎!


739
00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:10.139
Erase him‎!

740
00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:14.820
Drop the bubble guns‎!

741
00:48:14.979 --> 00:48:17.323
Or I will mess with this‎.‎.‎.

742
00:48:17.773 --> 00:48:19.616
gravity thingy‎.

743
00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:21.027
She is bluffing‎.

744
00:48:21.318 --> 00:48:24.117
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy‎.


745
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:27.374
Curse you and your tippy‎-toe tallness‎!

746
00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:29.326
But no problem‎.

747
00:48:29.493 --> 00:48:34.841
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out‎.


748
00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:36.342
Excuse me‎?

749
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:41.006
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry‎.

750
00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:47.474
She figured it out‎!
Run for my life‎!


751
00:48:49.138 --> 00:48:51.186
Out of my way‎! 
I am captain‎!

752
00:49:06.363 --> 00:49:07.364
Grab on‎!

753
00:49:08.324 --> 00:49:09.576
Oh‎, no‎! I can't hold you‎!

754
00:49:10.326 --> 00:49:12.078
You weigh‎, like‎, a thousand pounds‎!

755
00:49:13.203 --> 00:49:13.874
Let go‎.

756
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:15.881
‎- What‎?
‎- Trust me‎.


757
00:49:22.504 --> 00:49:24.552
Sorry‎. It is my
duty to run away first‎.

758
00:49:26.383 --> 00:49:27.054
Poomp‎.

759
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:29.060
‎- What are you waiting for‎?
‎- I cannot touch‎.


760
00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:30.721
It will not work if I drive it‎.

761
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:33.023
Fine‎. I'll drive‎.

762
00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:39.687
Owpain‎.

763
00:49:43.734 --> 00:49:45.327
You are terrible driver‎.

764
00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:12.513
Come on‎.

765
00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:14.898
Come on‎. Come on‎.

766
00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:16.270
Bon appétit‎.

767
00:50:16.392 --> 00:50:17.564
Oh‎, no‎, you don't‎!

768
00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:19.228
I am not paying for that‎.

769
00:50:37.579 --> 00:50:39.456
Come on‎, you stupid horse‎!

770
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:48.932
Whoo‎, that was cl‎.‎.‎.

771
00:50:59.476 --> 00:51:00.477
This time I got you‎.‎.‎.

772
00:51:00.644 --> 00:51:02.317
and you cannot escape‎.

773
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:04.155
Fugitive Boov detected‎.

774
00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:05.314
I was wrong‎.

775
00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:11.487
Jump‎!

776
00:51:11.613 --> 00:51:12.614
Oh‎, no‎!

777
00:51:24.835 --> 00:51:26.587
Look‎! I has found our car‎.

778
00:51:26.754 --> 00:51:27.755
Pig‎!

779
00:51:37.097 --> 00:51:39.350
I do not know whyfor you brought that‎.

780
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:41.189
We already hads food in the car‎.

781
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:43.353
It's not food‎, it's art‎.

782
00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:45.860
Then it is bad‎.

783
00:51:46.023 --> 00:51:48.151
Stars do not look like that‎.

784
00:51:48.317 --> 00:51:49.694
It's not about how they look‎.

785
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.988
It's about how they feel‎.

786
00:51:52.362 --> 00:51:53.955
They feel hot‎.

787
00:51:55.115 --> 00:51:58.210
Okay‎, math whiz‎, how long
till we get to Australia‎?


788
00:51:58.368 --> 00:52:00.541
17‎.9348 hours‎.

789
00:52:01.038 --> 00:52:02.711
And then‎, Gratuity Tucci‎.‎.‎.

790
00:52:02.873 --> 00:52:04.341
will see Mimom‎.

791
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.052
You hear that‎, Pig‎?

792
00:52:08.212 --> 00:52:10.886
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris‎.‎.‎.


793
00:52:11.048 --> 00:52:13.221
which you know she always wanted to do‎.

794
00:52:13.383 --> 00:52:15.385
Maybe we could both come back here‎.

795
00:52:15.552 --> 00:52:17.475
We do have a flying car now‎.

796
00:52:17.638 --> 00:52:20.232
How do you say "cat" in French‎?

797
00:52:20.724 --> 00:52:22.522
I think it's "chat‎."

798
00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:34.822
What is the purpose of your face‎?

799
00:52:38.534 --> 00:52:40.377
I has confusion‎.

800
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:44.586
I do not wish to be erased‎.

801
00:52:45.415 --> 00:52:47.918
But maybe Captain Smek is right‎.

802
00:52:48.418 --> 00:52:52.719
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes‎.


803
00:52:53.257 --> 00:52:54.258
Probably‎.

804
00:52:54.424 --> 00:52:56.426
That is not making me feel better‎.

805
00:52:56.593 --> 00:52:58.266
Nobody's perfect‎.

806
00:52:58.428 --> 00:53:02.774
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human‎.


807
00:53:02.933 --> 00:53:05.231
That is not what makes you Boov‎.

808
00:53:08.397 --> 00:53:10.115
Gratuity Tucci‎.‎.‎.

809
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:12.276
before we came‎.‎.‎.

810
00:53:12.442 --> 00:53:16.163
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us‎.


811
00:53:16.655 --> 00:53:19.499
That the humans were
just like the animals‎.‎.‎.


812
00:53:19.658 --> 00:53:21.956
and that we could to make them better‎.‎.‎.

813
00:53:22.119 --> 00:53:23.871
teach to them‎.

814
00:53:24.037 --> 00:53:29.043
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards‎.


815
00:53:30.794 --> 00:53:33.092
It is what we thought‎.

816
00:53:33.463 --> 00:53:34.635
But I am thinking now‎.‎.‎.

817
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:38.477
that we were thinking wrong‎.

818
00:53:38.635 --> 00:53:41.559
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest‎.

819
00:53:41.722 --> 00:53:46.102
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland‎.


820
00:53:46.268 --> 00:53:48.612
To Earthland‎.

821
00:53:49.104 --> 00:53:53.029
So I am saying
the sorry to you‎.‎.‎.


822
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:54.818
Gratuity Tucci‎.

823
00:54:03.827 --> 00:54:05.955
Call me Tip‎.

824
00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:15.260
It was a new home‎, a new country‎.

825
00:54:15.422 --> 00:54:17.140
I tried to make friends at school‎.‎.‎.

826
00:54:17.299 --> 00:54:21.145
but I was this nerd from Barbados‎.

827
00:54:21.303 --> 00:54:24.352
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry‎.


828
00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:26.061
Yeah‎, I did‎.

829
00:54:26.683 --> 00:54:29.527
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"‎.‎.‎.

830
00:54:29.686 --> 00:54:32.235
they were not happy to see me‎.

831
00:54:33.815 --> 00:54:36.910
The true is‎, among Boov‎,
I do not fit in‎.


832
00:54:37.778 --> 00:54:39.246
I fit out‎.

833
00:54:42.157 --> 00:54:44.330
She is so amazing‎.

834
00:54:44.493 --> 00:54:46.621
She saved up everything she had‎.‎.‎.

835
00:54:46.787 --> 00:54:49.757
so we could move
and things would be better for us‎.


836
00:54:50.082 --> 00:54:52.961
I cannot wait to meet Mimom‎.

837
00:54:57.923 --> 00:55:00.767
"My name is Captain Smek‎.
Shush‎, shush‎, shush‎."


838
00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:06.433
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out‎."


839
00:56:33.977 --> 00:56:35.069
How did they find us‎?

840
00:56:35.228 --> 00:56:36.480
I do not know‎!

841
00:56:43.153 --> 00:56:45.201
Wait‎. They're not attacking‎.

842
00:56:45.363 --> 00:56:47.411
Because they are running away‎.

843
00:56:48.575 --> 00:56:49.997
Why are they running away‎?

844
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.912
There can only be one reason‎.

845
00:57:05.133 --> 00:57:06.133
Gorg‎.

846
00:57:06.635 --> 00:57:09.479
This makes no sense‎.
I stopped the message‎.


847
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:11.807
Gorg cannot to finding us‎.

848
00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:13.813
Then how did they‎?

849
00:57:13.975 --> 00:57:16.194
There must be some other reason‎!

850
00:57:20.607 --> 00:57:22.109
Oh‎, behind us‎!

851
00:57:22.275 --> 00:57:24.027
Engage weapons system‎.

852
00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:25.696
We have a weapons system‎?

853
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.745
Go‎, Burrito Torpedo‎!

854
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.330
Yes‎!

855
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.003
We've been hit‎!
We're losing Grape Escape‎!


856
00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:42.591
We lost Tangerine Twist‎!

857
00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:45.803
If we lose Busta Lime‎, 
I cannot control‎!

858
00:57:46.007 --> 00:57:47.759
Click and ticket‎.
We are to crash‎!


859
00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:48.926
Oh‎!

860
00:58:06.736 --> 00:58:07.736
No‎, no‎, no‎.

861
00:58:08.071 --> 00:58:09.414
Slushious‎! No‎!

862
00:58:11.783 --> 00:58:13.376
Don't just stand there‎! Help‎!

863
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:16.584
Come on‎, come on‎, come on‎!

864
00:58:16.746 --> 00:58:19.090
Slushious‎! No‎!

865
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:27.132
She's gone‎.

866
00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:28.300
We are doomed‎.

867
00:58:28.466 --> 00:58:29.968
Now I'll never make it to Australia‎.

868
00:58:30.135 --> 00:58:32.263
I will now sing the Boov Death Song‎.

869
00:58:41.104 --> 00:58:42.151
A Gorg ship‎!

870
00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:43.874
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song‎.

871
00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.910
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car‎.


872
00:58:47.152 --> 00:58:49.996
I cannot‎. Those are Gorg parts‎.
They are metric‎.


873
00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:52.658
We're not getting this close
and giving up‎.


874
00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:53.916
‎- Come on‎.
‎- No‎!


875
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.127
Always with the running towards danger‎.

876
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:59.665
Stop being such a Boov‎.
It's our only chance‎. Come on‎.


877
00:59:02.751 --> 00:59:05.345
This has low probability of success‎!

878
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.807
‎- Let's go‎.
‎- Wait‎!


879
00:59:14.095 --> 00:59:15.142
For what‎?

880
00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:17.270
For you to change your mind‎.

881
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:18.600
Come on‎.

882
00:59:35.158 --> 00:59:36.159
There's no pilot‎.

883
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:37.953
It is just a drone‎.

884
00:59:41.539 --> 00:59:43.041
That could have been badness‎.

885
00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:44.710
But we are not safety‎.

886
00:59:44.876 --> 00:59:47.299
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough‎.


887
00:59:49.547 --> 00:59:50.844
Can you use any of this‎?

888
00:59:51.007 --> 00:59:52.224
Broken‎.

889
00:59:52.384 --> 00:59:53.510
Useless‎.

890
00:59:53.677 --> 00:59:55.679
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission‎.

891
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.017
What is it‎?

892
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.476
It is Gorg super‎-chip‎!

893
01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.530
Why is it called a super‎-chip‎?

894
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.861
It is mostly marketing‎.

895
01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:08.696
But it is key‎.‎.‎.

896
01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:12.533
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything‎.


897
01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.698
So we can never fight them with equaltude‎.

898
01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:16.366
Can we use it to fix Slushious‎?

899
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:18.831
Yes‎, yes‎! 
The Slushious will fly again‎.

900
01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.041
Yes‎!

901
01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:31.761
It was low probability of success‎.

902
01:00:31.923 --> 01:00:33.891
Some Boov you are‎.

903
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.677
Quickly‎.

904
01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:38.684
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom‎.


905
01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:39.894
"My" mom‎.

906
01:00:40.056 --> 01:00:41.228
That is the thing I said‎.

907
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.689
I knew this would all work out‎!

908
01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:48.781
You were awesome‎!

909
01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.066
We're gonna find my mom‎.‎.‎.

910
01:00:50.233 --> 01:00:53.077
you're gonna show everybody
the super‎-chip and be a big hero‎.‎.‎.


911
01:00:53.236 --> 01:00:55.614
and even Captain Smek will have to‎.‎.‎.

912
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.748
That's a lot of people‎.

913
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.385
‎- Bye‎, Boov‎!
‎- Get lost‎!


914
01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:24.814
Wow‎. You guys really are good
at running away‎.


915
01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:25.977
Yes‎.

916
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.113
Yes‎, we are‎.

917
01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:37.613
Look‎, over there‎!

918
01:01:37.655 --> 01:01:39.282
That's where we saw my mom‎!

919
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.339
Hurry up‎, it is the last ship‎!

920
01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:56.474
It's okay‎, Pig‎.
I'll be back with Mom‎.


921
01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.345
We're almost there‎!

922
01:02:01.346 --> 01:02:02.346
Over here‎.

923
01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:03.439
‎- What‎?
‎- Hurry‎!


924
01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:13.199
I don't understand‎.
She's in there‎?


925
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:16.819
Yes‎.

926
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.872
Tell me the truth‎.

927
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:21.374
There is no time‎.

928
01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:23.160
You can come with me‎.

929
01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:25.624
You will be safety‎.

930
01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.463
My mom's not on that ship‎, is she‎?

931
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.509
You promised to help me find her‎,
and you're leaving‎?


932
01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:38.891
‎- You lied to me‎.
‎- No‎!


933
01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.144
A lie is a bad thing‎.

934
01:02:41.302 --> 01:02:43.396
I did a thing so you can live‎.

935
01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:46.024
I'm not going‎.
My mom is here‎.


936
01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:47.525
You will never find her‎.

937
01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.061
It is 100%‎.

938
01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:51.696
Staying now does not make hope‎.

939
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.903
Gorg mothership will be here soon‎.

940
01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.201
It destroys planets‎.

941
01:02:57.026 --> 01:02:58.994
‎- We must run away now‎!
‎- No‎!


942
01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:00.406
It is true‎.

943
01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:04.042
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple‎, simple things‎.


944
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.749
I am saving you‎!
I am being your friend‎.


945
01:03:06.911 --> 01:03:09.380
No‎, you're just running away‎.

946
01:03:09.539 --> 01:03:11.837
You don't leave your family‎.

947
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.280
But you can't understand that‎.‎.‎.

948
01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:15.549
because you're just a Boov‎!

949
01:03:16.754 --> 01:03:19.598
You've never been my friend‎.

950
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.390
Wait‎!

951
01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:30.689
Final escape pod departing‎.

952
01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:16.151
I hate upon the Gorg‎!
They are always finding us‎!


953
01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.736
The Gorg mothership‎!

954
01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.087
We are doomed‎!

955
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.251
Run away‎!

956
01:04:37.293 --> 01:04:38.966
Make a path‎, 
I'm holding a baby‎.

957
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:48.934
It is the fugitive Boov‎!

958
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:51.145
He is running towards the danger‎!

959
01:04:51.474 --> 01:04:52.475
Stop him‎!

960
01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:05.662
Undo‎!

961
01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:27.518
Captain‎, we are achieving
new highest speeds‎!


962
01:05:28.803 --> 01:05:31.647
What has you done‎?
What is that thing‎?


963
01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:33.979
It is Gorg super‎-chip‎.

964
01:05:34.475 --> 01:05:35.475
What‎?

965
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.732
Gorg drone crashed‎.‎.‎.

966
01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:39.192
and I ran to it
and I found the chip‎.


967
01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:40.026
Enough‎.

968
01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:42.032
You ran to a Gorg‎?

969
01:05:43.526 --> 01:05:45.369
He runs towards the danger‎?

970
01:05:45.528 --> 01:05:46.871
What kind of Boov is he‎?

971
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:50.000
He is like a Super Boov‎.

972
01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:52.206
No‎, no‎, no‎.

973
01:05:52.368 --> 01:05:53.995
He is not a Super Boov‎.

974
01:05:54.162 --> 01:05:58.008
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship‎, and you know who it is‎.


975
01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.543
You're looking at him‎.

976
01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:01.711
I invented running away‎.

977
01:06:01.878 --> 01:06:05.178
And look at this‎.
I have the Shusher‎.


978
01:06:05.423 --> 01:06:07.551
I am your captain‎.

979
01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.219
But you are not good captain‎.

980
01:06:09.385 --> 01:06:10.432
What‎?

981
01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:13.940
You telled us these things‎,
and we all believed them‎.


982
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:15.892
I believed them‎.

983
01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:19.563
But then I met a humansperson‎.

984
01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:22.569
And she is not like you said‎.

985
01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:27.033
She is brave and smart‎.‎.‎.

986
01:06:27.195 --> 01:06:30.574
and cares about other humanspersons‎.

987
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.916
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other‎.


988
01:06:36.954 --> 01:06:39.082
She even cares about me‎.

989
01:06:39.707 --> 01:06:42.256
And I've done very little to earn that‎.

990
01:06:43.252 --> 01:06:46.131
The Boov may be superior in many ways‎.‎.‎.

991
01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:47.422
Yeah‎.

992
01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:50.643
‎.‎.‎.but not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important‎.


993
01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.315
Big deal‎!

994
01:06:56.474 --> 01:06:57.726
I have had enough‎. Shush‎!

995
01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:03.819
That is enough shushing‎.

996
01:07:03.981 --> 01:07:05.824
How dare you shush a shushing‎!

997
01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:08.782
Oh is right‎.
We need a new captain‎.


998
01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:12.081
I thinks it should be Oh‎!

999
01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:14.288
Me‎? No‎.

1000
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.918
No‎! He cannot be captain‎.

1001
01:07:16.077 --> 01:07:18.330
I have the Shusher‎. 
I am captain‎!

1002
01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:19.496
Not anymore‎!

1003
01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:23.251
He will not know how to operate it‎!

1004
01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:24.965
It is very complicated‎.

1005
01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:26.608
Heavy on one end‎, light on the other‎.

1006
01:07:26.629 --> 01:07:27.630
Shush‎!

1007
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:29.803
Booyah‎!

1008
01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:32.802
No‎, I am not a Leader Boov‎.

1009
01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:34.312
I makes far too many mistakes‎.

1010
01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:37.606
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes‎.


1011
01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:39.775
For examples‎.‎.‎.

1012
01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:43.484
my mistake is not being your friend‎.

1013
01:07:50.528 --> 01:07:52.656
All hail Captain Oh‎!

1014
01:07:55.324 --> 01:07:56.450
I saw who did that‎!

1015
01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:58.164
I hold grudges‎, you know‎!

1016
01:08:06.294 --> 01:08:07.637
Oh‎, you're the best‎!

1017
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:10.299
Want me to host party‎, Oh‎?

1018
01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:49.697
Go away‎.

1019
01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:53.531
No‎, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there‎?"


1020
01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.036
Then I am to be saying‎.‎.‎.

1021
01:09:55.194 --> 01:09:56.411
"Moo‎!"

1022
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:57.571
Oh‎!

1023
01:09:59.615 --> 01:10:01.913
I can't believe it‎!

1024
01:10:02.368 --> 01:10:04.120
But I saw your ship leave‎!

1025
01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:10.130
But you came back‎!
What are you doing here‎?


1026
01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:11.795
It is where I belongs‎.

1027
01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:14.760
You and Pigcat are my friends‎.

1028
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:17.092
And alsos‎, too‎.‎.‎.

1029
01:10:17.258 --> 01:10:19.135
I gave you a promise‎.

1030
01:11:41.175 --> 01:11:42.392
He's my friend‎.

1031
01:11:45.805 --> 01:11:46.897
Thank you‎.

1032
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:51.982
Mom‎.

1033
01:11:56.023 --> 01:11:57.570
Tippy‎. My beautiful girl‎.

1034
01:11:57.733 --> 01:12:00.407
I've been looking everywhere‎, Mom‎.

1035
01:12:00.569 --> 01:12:03.197
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again‎.


1036
01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:06.493
Mom‎, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you‎.


1037
01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:12.586
They are still looking‎.

1038
01:12:29.223 --> 01:12:31.100
Gorg are not the takers‎.

1039
01:12:31.934 --> 01:12:33.436
Boov are‎.

1040
01:12:37.815 --> 01:12:40.318
We must demonstrate our affections later‎.

1041
01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:42.327
There is still one problem‎.

1042
01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:44.284
Excuse me‎, what is that‎?

1043
01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:47.291
That is Gorg mothership‎.
It is here to destroy the planet‎.


1044
01:12:52.538 --> 01:12:53.858
It's going to destroy the planet‎?

1045
01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:56.501
Yes‎. But I haves a plan‎.

1046
01:13:10.973 --> 01:13:12.099
Oh‎?

1047
01:13:15.186 --> 01:13:16.358
What are you doing‎?

1048
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.022
I am sorry‎.

1049
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:20.863
Tip cannot come into the out now‎.

1050
01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:22.993
I am fixing my mistake‎.

1051
01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:26.706
Oh‎! You can't do this on your own‎!

1052
01:13:26.864 --> 01:13:28.582
Maybe not‎.

1053
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:30.789
But I haves hope‎.

1054
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.797
No‎!

1055
01:13:34.955 --> 01:13:36.081
Stop‎, no‎!

1056
01:13:37.166 --> 01:13:38.668
Please don't do this by yourself‎!

1057
01:13:44.882 --> 01:13:45.929
No‎! Don't‎!

1058
01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:48.348
Oh‎!

1059
01:14:07.738 --> 01:14:10.241
Stop‎!

1060
01:14:13.786 --> 01:14:15.538
Look‎!

1061
01:14:21.752 --> 01:14:23.004
Hey‎!

1062
01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:32.145
Gorg‎!

1063
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:34.974
It is useless to yell‎.

1064
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:36.484
Gorg‎!

1065
01:14:45.818 --> 01:14:47.240
They're not gonna see him‎.

1066
01:14:47.403 --> 01:14:48.575
It's not gonna work‎!

1067
01:14:49.446 --> 01:14:50.493
Merry Christmas‎.

1068
01:14:50.656 --> 01:14:52.124
‎- Now‎?
‎- Just open it‎.


1069
01:14:55.119 --> 01:14:57.121
Thank you‎, sweetheart‎, but what‎.‎.‎.

1070
01:14:57.788 --> 01:14:58.539
What are you doing‎?

1071
01:14:58.706 --> 01:15:00.800
Distracting the driver‎.

1072
01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:37.586
It worked‎! The ship's stopping‎!

1073
01:15:45.127 --> 01:15:46.549
It's not gonna stop in time‎!

1074
01:15:54.386 --> 01:15:55.979
Stop faster‎!

1075
01:15:56.138 --> 01:15:58.015
He's gotta get out of there‎!

1076
01:15:59.183 --> 01:16:01.686
Mom‎, help me with this thing‎!

1077
01:16:10.486 --> 01:16:11.487
Oh‎!

1078
01:16:11.987 --> 01:16:12.987
Oh‎!

1079
01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:14.494
Run‎!

1080
01:16:14.782 --> 01:16:15.453
Tip‎!

1081
01:16:15.616 --> 01:16:16.663
Stop‎!

1082
01:16:16.825 --> 01:16:18.077
Tip‎!

1083
01:17:21.056 --> 01:17:22.057
Mom‎!

1084
01:17:53.589 --> 01:17:54.681
Oh‎!

1085
01:18:00.429 --> 01:18:01.601
You're alive‎.

1086
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:04.108
But you scared me so bad‎!

1087
01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:05.768
You were scared‎?

1088
01:18:05.934 --> 01:18:08.028
I almost made a number three‎.

1089
01:18:08.187 --> 01:18:09.187
Not too hard‎!

1090
01:18:09.271 --> 01:18:11.774
It is still a possibility‎.

1091
01:20:21.111 --> 01:20:23.239
What was all that‎?

1092
01:20:23.405 --> 01:20:27.035
Not all Gorg‎-speak has humans words‎.

1093
01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:31.752
But‎, it turns out‎, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation‎.‎.‎.


1094
01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.212
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend‎.


1095
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:39.426
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock‎.


1096
01:20:39.588 --> 01:20:41.090
What was in that thing‎?

1097
01:20:41.256 --> 01:20:42.382
Gorg family‎.

1098
01:20:42.966 --> 01:20:45.810
It is entire next generation‎.

1099
01:20:46.094 --> 01:20:47.437
All of them‎?

1100
01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:49.439
All of them‎.

1101
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.073
No wonder they've been chasing you‎.

1102
01:21:02.778 --> 01:21:05.281
Not "they‎," "he‎."

1103
01:21:05.447 --> 01:21:09.293
Apparently‎, that Gorg is last Gorg‎.

1104
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:11.453
That is why rock was so important‎.

1105
01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.622
Without it‎, he was alonely‎.‎.‎.

1106
01:21:13.789 --> 01:21:16.212
and would someday be extinctly‎.‎.‎.

1107
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.424
