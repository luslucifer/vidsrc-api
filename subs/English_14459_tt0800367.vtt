1
00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:08.408
No, I'm not a sausage.

2
00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.811
Non. Non c'est trois not do it.

3
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.645
Ah, bravo. Bravo.

4
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.446
Ah, bravo. Voilà.

5
00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.487
You are bilingue now.

6
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.353
You're the sausage, mate, not me.

7
00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:24.619
Non, non, do it.

8
00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:26.762
J'adore quand tu parle français.

9
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.298
You know, I... 
I don't really care what you say.

10
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.458
It sounds good. Heh heh.

11
00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:34.526
I spoke to your mom this morning.

12
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:36.196
You spoke to my mom?

13
00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:38.297
She's devious, my mother.

14
00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:40.308
She tried to speak French to me.

15
00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:42.139
What she was trying... She was...

16
00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:44.373
- She was trying to nag in French.
- Yeah.


17
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.211
- She wants to cover all bases.
- Yeah.


18
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.783
Why do you think
she likes you so much?

19
00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.414
Because I'm the best.
Look what you had before me.


20
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.424
Well, she didn't like
any of my other girlfriends.

21
00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:57.016
No. Look at me.

22
00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.390
Look at you.

23
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.190
Of course she loves me.

24
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.458
I cook well. I'm an artist.

25
00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:05.030
I'm French and talented,

26
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.392
and I live with you.

27
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.864
She told me that
you had a nose job,

28
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.268
- and I thought that was sort of gay.
- I had a what?


29
00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.038
What did I have?

30
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.544
A nose job.

31
00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.376
- Nose job? I didn't get a nose job.
- I was...


32
00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.042
- Yes.
- She said nice job. She said I got a nice job.


33
00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.245
Yeah, nice job. Honey, 
I want to see...

34
00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:35.385
Thank you.

35
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.948
Thanks, mate.

36
00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.257
Ready to rock, baby?

37
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:43.026
- That's it?
- That's it.


38
00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.267
So they let us take
the boat out without knowing anything?

39
00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:47.432
Just leave the technical stuff to me, babe.

40
00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.336
- Okay, boss. You have a tag here.
- Come on, let's get on.


41
00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:00.607
Okay?

42
00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.175
Why you didn't get a bigger boat?

43
00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:05.653
What's wrong with this boat?

44
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:09.153
It's a beautiful handcrafted timber boat.

45
00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.459
Old-fashioned, like me.

46
00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.760
Easy.

47
00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:48.322
I wish for fish

48
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.485
for a fine fish dish.

49
00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:57.795
- I thought you had a busy week...
- We dropped the case.


50
00:06:58.067 --> 00:06:59.926
You've dropped the Chapman case?

51
00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:02.493
Well, we can't win. 
Their word against hers, so...

52
00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.264
- Yeah, we dropped the case.
- But they raped her.


53
00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:06.738
Well, they say they didn't do it.

54
00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:08.609
That's the problem with crime:
the crooks always deny it.


55
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.643
- It's a real bitch.
- And you're okay with this?


56
00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:15.809
If it were up to me, I'd have the shit kicked out of them,
then I'd have them locked up, but it's not up to me.


57
00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:17.583
- So, you get raped...
- Oh, come on, sweetheart. Can't we just...


58
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.019
So, you get raped, and you just forget it because
the courts are all stacked against you?


59
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.451
Sorry, Mrs. Chapman.
Tough turkey, huh?


60
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.100
Tough titty, babe.

61
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.256
Titty.

62
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.795
I don't... I don't understand.

63
00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:33.501
I mean, justice. Yeah.

64
00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:34.797
Come on, baby.

65
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.635
Let's have a little drink, a little topper.

66
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.675
Whoa, Baby! That's you!
Come on! Come on! Reel it in!


67
00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:42.234
- No, you do it!
- No, honey, it's your pole, it's your fish.


68
00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:44.643
Just... round, round.
That bit there.


69
00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:46.174
It won't go. No, please do it.

70
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:47.216
Give it here.

71
00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:49.683
I got it. Ooh, that's a monster.

72
00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:51.947
- It's a big one. Whoa!
- Wha...


73
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.114
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!


74
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.521
No, don't kill it!

75
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:57.957
No, do not! Don't kill it!

76
00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:04.993
It's a flathead.

77
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.695
That's disgusting.

78
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.864
Yeah, well, that's fishing, baby.

79
00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:37.124
Weather's changed.

80
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.827
Pushing us north.

81
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.965
What's happened to our nice, sunny day, babe?

82
00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:51.079
Let's go back. 
It's getting cold.

83
00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:55.049
Looks like it'll pass over.

84
00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:56.584
Let's swing around those heads,

85
00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:59.485
come on back, just past those mangroves.

86
00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:02.115
What do you reckon?

87
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.818
Yeah, let's do it.

88
00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:05.292
Come on, weigh anchor.

89
00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:19.769
There we go.

90
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:27.909
Voilà.

91
00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:30.818
Voilà.

92
00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.059
Voilà.

93
00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:11.466
We are lost, aren't we?

94
00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:15.436
Well, it's too shallow for the outboard.

95
00:13:15.411 --> 00:13:17.240
I guess the tide
goes out quickly around here.

96
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:19.077
What does that mean?

97
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:22.174
That means...

98
00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:24.082
that's for you...

99
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.384
and this is for me.

100
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.081
Okay, where are we going now?

101
00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:33.920
Well, we know the tide runs back into the bay,
so I guess we just go with it.


102
00:14:02.124 --> 00:14:04.115
It's getting shallower, Rob.

103
00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:07.825
Where are we?

104
00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:09.397
We're in a drain.

105
00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:11.326
A what?

106
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.491
Agricultural drain.

107
00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:18.001
Probably caught in a non-eccentric drainage paddock.

108
00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:22.171
You bring me boating in a drain?

109
00:14:22.244 --> 00:14:24.906
I'm full of surprises.

110
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.574
I think we've come about a mile inland,

111
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.983
so gotta be some farms around here somewhere.

112
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:39.928
What are you doing now?

113
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:43.155
I'm just gonna climb up, have a look.

114
00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.632
Just for a... Iook.

115
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:13.785
We've been going in circles.

116
00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:16.457
All right, I fucked up. I'm sorry.

117
00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:18.397
I can't believe this.

118
00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:20.162
We can't float, we can't walk,

119
00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:22.466
and... and I'm tired now.

120
00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:24.403
Come on, babe. 
There's nothing we can do about it.

121
00:15:24.473 --> 00:15:25.963
Let's just pretend we're castaways.

122
00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:29.738
That's what we are, castaways, damn you.

123
00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:32.606
There's a building or something up ahead.
I'm gonna go scout around.


124
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.205
You coming, or you gonna wait here?

125
00:15:34.283 --> 00:15:37.480
No, I'd like to wait here, 
Rob, with the crabs and mosquitoes.

126
00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:41.014
There's still no reception, of course.

127
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.786
Jesus. How many times do I gotta apologize?

128
00:15:52.902 --> 00:15:53.994
See?

129
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:56.367
Stop it. Stay here. Look around.

130
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.131
What are they doing?

131
00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:08.341
I don't like it. Let's go.

132
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.443
Let's go.

133
00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:03.471
Look up there.

134
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:10.311
Wait here.

135
00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:28.159
There's a farmhouse or something up there.

136
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.162
It'll be fine.

137
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:30.323
- A farm?
- Yeah. Yeah.


138
00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:33.596
We'll get a taxi back to
the car, drinking margaritas by midday.

139
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:35.000
Come on.

140
00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:39.657
Hello.

141
00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:44.399
There's nobody here.

142
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.072
Wait here. I'll check the back.

143
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.575
Okay. Be careful.

144
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:50.703
Hey.

145
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:53.036
It's all right. 
It's all right.

146
00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.632
Is anybody here?

147
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.473
It's okay. There's no one here.

148
00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:59.170
Are you sure we should be just
breaking into somebody's house?


149
00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:01.839
We're not breaking in.
There's no one there.


150
00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:04.147
Come on.

151
00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:24.032
Oh, my God.

152
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.066
I think pigs live here.

153
00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:31.339
Any port in a storm.

154
00:20:32.548 --> 00:20:35.016
Oh, that's disgusting.

155
00:20:37.886 --> 00:20:39.649
I feel like Goldilocks.

156
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.823
Here's your 3 bears.

157
00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:54.191
I'm gonna take a look around,
see if I can find a phone.

158
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.431
Be careful.

159
00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.686
Ah, fuck.

160
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:21.242
Rob!

161
00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:25.982
Rob!

162
00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:41.030
Somebody's outside.

163
00:23:41.103 --> 00:23:43.867
Come on, we gotta get
out of here. Come on.

164
00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:51.605
Get out of my fucking house!

165
00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:56.950
Don't make me come in
there and drag you fuckers out!

166
00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.682
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out!

167
00:24:07.763 --> 00:24:09.253
Get out of the fucking house!

168
00:24:09.331 --> 00:24:11.629
Listen, mate, my name's Rob Brewer. We didn't...

169
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.395
I'm not your mate, Robert.

170
00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:15.026
Get the fuck out of my house!

171
00:24:16.571 --> 00:24:19.438
Look, we were just out boating, and...

172
00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:22.136
Listen, we don't...

173
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:28.747
Oh, hey. Hey.

174
00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:30.216
Come on, we...

175
00:24:30.285 --> 00:24:33.118
Now, what you fucking doing in there, slick?

176
00:24:34.322 --> 00:24:37.086
We were just out, uh... boating,

177
00:24:37.159 --> 00:24:39.684
and, uh... you know, we, uh...

178
00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:41.853
we were so tired, we got lost,

179
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.694
and we saw your light.

180
00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:45.198
We just thought...

181
00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:48.202
Thought you'd make yourself at home, eh?

182
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.033
No, no, no, no, no.

183
00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:52.039
The back door was open. We, uh...

184
00:24:52.107 --> 00:24:55.565
Oh, the back door was...
the back door was open.

185
00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:58.807
We'd just like to use your phone, please.

186
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.677
That's all, all right?

187
00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:03.681
You don't have a phone?

188
00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.723
If we could just
get to the nearest, um...

189
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.953
The nearest anything's 26 mile away, slick.

190
00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:15.622
Well, if you fellas could take us there,

191
00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:18.029
I'd be happy to fix
you up for any expenses.

192
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.659
Oh, that is rich.

193
00:25:20.735 --> 00:25:24.535
You're gonna fix us up with what, slick?

194
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:27.803
Well, if you could just...

195
00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:31.445
point us to the nearest main road, we'll be on
our way and there won't be any trouble.


196
00:25:32.647 --> 00:25:34.410
You really are lost, aren't ya?

197
00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:35.575
Lost, huh? Fucking!

198
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.588
There's no main roads around here, slick.

199
00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:43.283
You're on an island.

200
00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:48.359
French lsland? 
We're on French lsland.

201
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.897
When is the ferry...

202
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:56.028
You go and get Poppy out of the truck.
You put him to bed.


203
00:25:56.104 --> 00:25:57.969
If he sees these
2, he's gonna fucking freak.

204
00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:59.734
Fuck!

205
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:15.912
Sorry about my brother there.

206
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.619
But he gets a bit excited.

207
00:26:20.962 --> 00:26:22.293
Please.

208
00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:36.435
After all, you can't be too careful, eh?

209
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:39.537
Lot of creeps come around,
bustin' into houses and shit.

210
00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:41.514
Please, if you could just take us...

211
00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:43.050
What's that?

212
00:26:43.118 --> 00:26:44.483
I said if you
could just take us to...

213
00:26:47.422 --> 00:26:49.413
You got yourself a frog chick, eh?

214
00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:53.193
You're a real Frenchie on French lsland, eh?

215
00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:58.398
Hey, doll, see this?

216
00:26:58.466 --> 00:27:01.367
I found him on
the side of the road.

217
00:27:02.837 --> 00:27:04.065
You like kangaroos, darling?

218
00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:05.071
Yes.

219
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.539
Yes?

220
00:27:06.608 --> 00:27:08.701
Want to pet him?

221
00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:10.870
Go on, he won't bite.

222
00:27:15.984 --> 00:27:19.078
I might, though.

223
00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:23.715
You out boating, you say?

224
00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:28.089
Yeah.

225
00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:31.132
Her car's back at the boat harbor.

226
00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:38.662
Please, if you could just
take us to the nearest phone.

227
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.903
The switchboard in Tankerton closes at 7:30, darling.

228
00:27:41.977 --> 00:27:44.002
The switchboard closes?

229
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.740
What, are you fucking deaf?

230
00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:51.047
Closes at 7:30!

231
00:27:52.854 --> 00:27:55.379
No, this isn't the city out here, slick.

232
00:27:55.457 --> 00:27:57.516
You're in the boonies now.

233
00:27:57.892 --> 00:28:00.652
We go for weeks
without seeing shit out here.

234
00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:18.979
That there's Poppy.

235
00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:23.342
Yeah, he's kind of a tired little camper.
He's had a very big day.


236
00:28:26.388 --> 00:28:27.855
This place Tankerton,

237
00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:30.117
if you could just
take us to a hotel.

238
00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:35.660
What hotel's that, darlin'?

239
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.666
Yeah, would you like the Tankerton
Regency or the lsland Hilton?


240
00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:46.300
So you had a bit of a look around
the property before we got here?


241
00:28:46.374 --> 00:28:48.365
There's, um...

242
00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:50.035
There's gotta be some
way we can contact someone...

243
00:28:50.111 --> 00:28:52.477
Come on, slick.

244
00:28:52.547 --> 00:28:55.107
It's coming down cats and dogs out there.

245
00:28:55.183 --> 00:28:56.775
Plenty of room here.

246
00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:00.551
Now, tomorrow, 
I'll drive you in to Tankerton. How's that?

247
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:05.786
You probably want to get out of them
clammy wet suits, or what?


248
00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:12.025
Yeah, look like you could use a hot
shower and some dry clothes.


249
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.068
The both of youse.

250
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.659
Yes, please.

251
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:20.035
All right, You get started,

252
00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:21.939
I'll boil you up
some water for your shower.

253
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.007
We don't want to
put you to any trouble.

254
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.111
Oh, it's no trouble, darling.

255
00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:29.480
Not yet, anyway.

256
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:31.219
You go on outside.

257
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.376
Shower's on the back porch there.

258
00:29:32.554 --> 00:29:34.519
Towels are inside the door.

259
00:29:36.324 --> 00:29:38.815
Here you go.

260
00:29:38.893 --> 00:29:41.259
Oh, thank you.

261
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.827
Hey, slick.

262
00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:49.468
What sort of car?

263
00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:50.469
Car?

264
00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:52.870
This car you got, what sort is it?

265
00:29:52.941 --> 00:29:55.000
It's a Volvo 870.

266
00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:03.275
Go on, Volvo.

267
00:30:07.822 --> 00:30:10.552
Fucking Volvo!

268
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.265
We gotta get out of here.

269
00:30:20.335 --> 00:30:21.597
You're telling me?

270
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:23.002
We're talking cavemen here.

271
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:23.963
These guys are sick.

272
00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:26.364
There's a shed full
of marijuana out the back.

273
00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:29.543
They're growing the stuff. A lot of it.

274
00:30:29.611 --> 00:30:31.704
It's none of our business.

275
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.771
They're not gonna let
us walk away from here.

276
00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:37.045
There's enough pot there to put
these guys away for 10 years.


277
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:40.152
Honey, they're not gonna let us go.

278
00:30:40.221 --> 00:30:42.314
We gotta get the cops back here.

279
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.117
- I knew we shouldn't have...
- Listen. Listen.


280
00:30:44.292 --> 00:30:46.423
They don't know that we know.

281
00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:49.700
- Okay? Just play it cool, babe.
- They're the ones we saw before, aren't they.


282
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.531
What were they doing to that boy?

283
00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:54.193
I don't know. I don't know.

284
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:56.737
My best guess would be
just to do what they say.

285
00:30:56.805 --> 00:30:58.500
The first chance we
get, we'll take off, okay?

286
00:30:58.573 --> 00:30:59.905
- Okay.
- Okay.


287
00:31:01.142 --> 00:31:02.268
It's going to be okay.

288
00:31:02.343 --> 00:31:03.275
It's okay, baby.

289
00:31:03.344 --> 00:31:05.369
- Yeah.
- I love you.


290
00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:21.353
Where are our clothes?

291
00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:25.664
They're gone.

292
00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.130
- And our wet suits?
- They're gone.


293
00:31:29.904 --> 00:31:32.873
They're fucking with us. Put this on.

294
00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:37.872
Put it on.

295
00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:39.743
This is bad.

296
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:41.179
You wait here.

297
00:31:41.849 --> 00:31:42.580
Where are you going?

298
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.379
- Just wait.
- No, please.


299
00:31:44.452 --> 00:31:47.250
- Bring me along, please.
- You just wait. I'll fix it.


300
00:31:47.422 --> 00:31:48.948
- No.
- Wait.


301
00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:51.082
You're all right.

302
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.400
You wake Poppy, you
know what's gonna fucking happen!

303
00:32:09.577 --> 00:32:12.011
We can't seem to find
the pants you guys gave us.

304
00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:15.607
Well, that's a fucking mystery.

305
00:32:17.318 --> 00:32:20.082
Come on. You gonna give
us some pants or what?

306
00:32:20.154 --> 00:32:23.419
Not up to your Volvo standards, huh, boss?

307
00:32:25.093 --> 00:32:28.529
Listen, my wife's scared. 
We're both tired.

308
00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:30.860
Give us a break, will ya?

309
00:32:30.932 --> 00:32:33.196
Give you a break?

310
00:32:33.268 --> 00:32:37.329
You fucking yuppie tort rat.

311
00:32:42.443 --> 00:32:44.843
You fuck up out in the water, hmm?

312
00:32:46.514 --> 00:32:48.209
You break into our house.

313
00:32:50.452 --> 00:32:53.419
And then you help yourself
to our private fucking property,

314
00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:57.450
and then you bitch and moan
because we ain't got a phone.

315
00:32:57.527 --> 00:33:01.827
You are fucking unbelievable, sunshine.

316
00:33:03.431 --> 00:33:05.160
So what do you want? Hmm?

317
00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:06.860
Do you want my trousers?

318
00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:11.963
No, no, no, no. 'Cause...

319
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.009
I'm not the one who fucked up.

320
00:33:15.376 --> 00:33:17.306
You fucked up.

321
00:33:17.378 --> 00:33:20.211
And you are starting
to give me the shits.

322
00:33:21.181 --> 00:33:24.244
Well, I think you better wake the old guy up.
I want to speak to him.


323
00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:27.984
Oh, no, no. That wouldn't
be a good idea at all.

324
00:33:30.191 --> 00:33:31.852
Then can we have our wet suits back?

325
00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:34.588
What, those heavy things?

326
00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:36.527
What, do you wanna catch a
cold and give it to us?

327
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:41.860
No, you see, this
is a working farm, slick.

328
00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:44.200
It's hard enough to scratch out a living...

329
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:49.134
without some city butt-stain coming in here and
treating this place like his own private shit can.


330
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.907
You are an inconsiderate bastard.

331
00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:58.178
Considering how you tracked dirt and shit
all the way through this fucking house.


332
00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:02.752
You've left the tap running outside.
You've wasted half a tank of water.


333
00:34:05.593 --> 00:34:08.084
And you left the lights
on in the back shed.

334
00:34:12.934 --> 00:34:15.630
Now, what's your old
lady like as a cook?

335
00:34:25.546 --> 00:34:27.776
They know about the drugs.

336
00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:30.317
I think we should
do what they say, baby.

337
00:34:49.804 --> 00:34:53.399
Jimmy, get her to say
somethin' in froggy talk. Go on.

338
00:34:53.474 --> 00:34:55.669
Darling.

339
00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:58.570
Darling?

340
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.311
Say something in frog talk.

341
00:35:02.383 --> 00:35:04.442
Give me some of that fucking...

342
00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:07.716
parléz-vous, oui-oui lingo.

343
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:10.622
Oui-oui lingo.

344
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:12.249
Fucking...

345
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:14.450
Go on.

346
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.288
That is fucking sexy.

347
00:35:41.355 --> 00:35:44.051
What'd you say, pussycat?

348
00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:49.393
- It's a...
- It's a Gallic folk song.


349
00:35:50.531 --> 00:35:53.591
Mothers sing it to their children.

350
00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:03.004
My cup's empty, captain.

351
00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:13.845
Yeah, a thin dick!

352
00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:19.625
Hey, Volvo,

353
00:36:19.894 --> 00:36:23.858
I want you to show
us your old lady's ass.

354
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.865
Let's see if that's as
good as an Aussie ass.

355
00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:27.491
This has gone far enough.

356
00:36:27.568 --> 00:36:28.830
We just wanna see your old lady's booty.

357
00:36:28.903 --> 00:36:31.371
We did you a favor, now
you do us a fucking favor.

358
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:33.168
- Quid pro fucking quo!
- Quo! Quo!


359
00:36:33.241 --> 00:36:35.038
Forget it.

360
00:36:39.914 --> 00:36:44.542
What, now you're telling me what I can and
can't do in my own fucking house, Volvo?


361
00:36:47.555 --> 00:36:50.524
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

362
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.488
No, no, no. No. No.

363
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:55.522
It doesn't matter, Rob. Please.

364
00:37:04.205 --> 00:37:05.502
That's enough.

365
00:37:05.573 --> 00:37:08.542
Who the fuck is
talking to you, Volvo, eh?

366
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:14.445
Now, my drink is still empty, captain.

367
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.348
What the fuck's this for?

368
00:37:24.425 --> 00:37:26.916
You burned the fucking eggs!

369
00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:29.758
What are we supposed to
do with this shit, eh?

370
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.594
What is this? This your
parléz-vous fucking whore cuisine, is it?

371
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:35.295
What, you serve that to Volvo, eh?

372
00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:36.631
Well, that's fucking great.

373
00:37:38.206 --> 00:37:39.673
See those?

374
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.765
That's the last of the eggs.

375
00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:43.935
Now what the fuck are
we gonna do for dinner?

376
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:47.037
Eh? What are we gonna do for dinner?

377
00:37:47.114 --> 00:37:51.881
'Cause Brett and me,
we're hungry, aren't we, Brett?

378
00:37:51.953 --> 00:37:54.581
I suppose maybe you could help me, huh?

379
00:37:57.158 --> 00:38:01.685
'Cause Brett and me, we're hungry, and we wanna
know what the fuck you're gonna do about it!


380
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:15.568
Come on, it's just
a fucking animal. Kill it.

381
00:38:16.143 --> 00:38:17.907
I can't.

382
00:38:17.979 --> 00:38:19.446
It's just a fucking wallaby.

383
00:38:19.513 --> 00:38:21.673
Thousands of these little fuckers
die on the roads every night.

384
00:38:21.749 --> 00:38:24.981
- Come on, cut it!
- I'll cut it, Jim.


385
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:28.880
What are you, one
of these bleeding heart motherfuckers?

386
00:38:29.957 --> 00:38:32.289
Save all the fuzzy fucking creatures.

387
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.796
I just don't kill things.

388
00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:43.895
Well... Well, I guess we could just stain the little
fucker while he's still alive, eh, Brett?


389
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:46.701
I mean, how inhumane
is that gonna be, eh?

390
00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:48.366
Fucking kill the fucker!

391
00:38:48.442 --> 00:38:50.069
Leave her alone, will you?

392
00:38:50.144 --> 00:38:53.875
God, you've got some balls, eh, Volvo?

393
00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:56.280
No! Just leave her alone.

394
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.443
You got some fucking balls, huh?

395
00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:00.817
Leave her alone, please!

396
00:39:00.888 --> 00:39:04.119
Let's see what your fucking
yuppie balls look like, eh?

397
00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:07.592
Maybe we can fry
'em up with Scooby there.

398
00:39:07.662 --> 00:39:09.960
Wouldn't be the first time we
taste the old long big, eh, Brett?

399
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.000
- Please.
- Poppy says we shouldn't talk about that.


400
00:39:14.035 --> 00:39:16.566
Maybe we take your fucking kidneys, eh?

401
00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:20.420
Just cut 'em right out and
we'll feed the scraps to Honky, eh?

402
00:39:20.508 --> 00:39:25.750
Now you hold real still, slick, 'cause this
is gonna hurt just a little fucking bit.


403
00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:32.712
Ooh-wee, doggie!

404
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:40.827
Looks like you're the one

405
00:39:40.895 --> 00:39:43.559
with the balls, darling.

406
00:39:48.569 --> 00:39:50.366
It's all right.

407
00:39:50.438 --> 00:39:52.736
Please.

408
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:05.410
You...

409
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:08.649
You ought to be a fucking chef, oui-oui.

410
00:40:08.723 --> 00:40:11.556
You got a job in the city?

411
00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:14.822
What do you do for crust, eh?

412
00:40:15.095 --> 00:40:16.487
I'm an artist.

413
00:40:17.464 --> 00:40:18.564
An artist.

414
00:40:21.234 --> 00:40:23.061
What do you make? 
A whole shit pile of money, or what?

415
00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:26.405
I get by.

416
00:40:26.474 --> 00:40:28.374
Yeah, I'll bet.

417
00:40:28.442 --> 00:40:31.002
I bet you fucking get by.

418
00:40:39.587 --> 00:40:41.052
And what about you, no-balls?

419
00:40:42.222 --> 00:40:45.719
What do you do when you're not getting
lost in a little fucking boat?


420
00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:50.123
I'm a barrister.

421
00:40:51.966 --> 00:40:53.297
What?

422
00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:54.800
A barrister.

423
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.269
"Beeraster"?

424
00:40:58.672 --> 00:40:59.866
You fucking beeraster.

425
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.306
Move to strike or order a fucking beer!

426
00:41:04.376 --> 00:41:06.403
It's Poppy.

427
00:41:32.807 --> 00:41:35.776
Do you know what we
do for a dollar, darling?

428
00:41:38.212 --> 00:41:39.941
No.

429
00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:46.116
Are you sure?

430
00:41:47.287 --> 00:41:49.315
I have no idea what you do.

431
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.623
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

432
00:41:57.865 --> 00:42:00.891
Listen, my husband and I are tired.

433
00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:02.429
If there's a place where we can...

434
00:42:02.503 --> 00:42:06.230
Lie down your weary heads, huh? Go, na-nas?

435
00:42:07.007 --> 00:42:09.208
But, of course, oui-oui.

436
00:42:09.476 --> 00:42:11.938
You must be exhausted!

437
00:42:16.517 --> 00:42:19.645
It's been a big
day for you, hasn't it?

438
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.119
Driving that heavy fucking Volvo all the
way out from the city going boating.


439
00:42:24.891 --> 00:42:25.888
Fishing.

440
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.053
Whatever the fuck you were doing.

441
00:42:28.728 --> 00:42:29.891
Well...

442
00:42:31.732 --> 00:42:35.600
I am sorry that we didn't
set up the suite for you.

443
00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:38.069
But you...

444
00:42:38.138 --> 00:42:40.504
can have the whole barn to yourselves.

445
00:42:40.774 --> 00:42:42.872
How's that?

446
00:42:42.943 --> 00:42:45.434
The barn will be fine, thank you.

447
00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:50.177
The barn will be fine, love.

448
00:42:50.251 --> 00:42:52.481
Jolly good, old cock.

449
00:43:09.537 --> 00:43:11.264
Voilà.

450
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:21.204
Get Honky to guard that fucking door.

451
00:43:22.082 --> 00:43:24.615
Honky!

452
00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:31.752
Honky!

453
00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:37.988
Stupid mutt.

454
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.453
We're getting out of here.

455
00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:02.182
You think they'll just let us run?

456
00:44:02.256 --> 00:44:03.245
What about the dog?

457
00:44:03.324 --> 00:44:04.723
We don't have a choice.

458
00:44:04.792 --> 00:44:06.922
We are not gonna stick
around to see what happens next.

459
00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.562
- Okay.
- Come on.


460
00:44:14.935 --> 00:44:16.234
Come on.

461
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.741
This is too easy.

462
00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:29.180
Go! Move!

463
00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:30.716
- Is this the way back?
- Come on, go!


464
00:44:32.286 --> 00:44:33.685
- Is this the way back?
- Come on.


465
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:36.018
- Is this the track?
- Hurry up!


466
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.515
Move it!

467
00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:41.691
Come on!

468
00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:46.863
No. No!

469
00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:02.877
Jesus Christ, they killed him.

470
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.975
They cut him. Fuck.

471
00:45:05.052 --> 00:45:06.052
Hey!

472
00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.656
Get him, Honk.

473
00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:20.722
Go! Get 'em!

474
00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:35.072
You miss me?

475
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.549
Get in the fucking truck!

476
00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:53.560
Skipping out without paying the
tariff is against the law, slick.

477
00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:58.165
Listen, I don't care if
you guys are growing weed.

478
00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:00.433
I mean, I smoke pot.

479
00:46:00.607 --> 00:46:04.466
Unlawful incarceration is a major crime.

480
00:46:04.545 --> 00:46:06.809
You need to think about what you're doing.

481
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.440
Incarceration.

482
00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:12.576
You fucking lawyer.

483
00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:14.678
You gonna sue us, frog-fucker?

484
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:18.617
What about that guy out there?

485
00:46:18.692 --> 00:46:20.023
What guy out where?

486
00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:21.222
The guy in the red track suit.

487
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:23.022
What fucking red track suit, slick?

488
00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:25.523
Listen.

489
00:46:25.566 --> 00:46:27.594
I can help you.

490
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:31.063
What's it gonna take?

491
00:46:31.138 --> 00:46:34.403
How much? 100,000?

492
00:46:34.475 --> 00:46:37.410
200,000?

493
00:46:37.478 --> 00:46:40.311
What do you want?

494
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.940
I got what I want.

495
00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:45.849
Come here. Come here!

496
00:46:48.655 --> 00:46:51.249
Now take off your pants and your shoes.

497
00:46:52.659 --> 00:46:55.059
Now!

498
00:46:55.129 --> 00:46:56.494
Yes.

499
00:47:02.803 --> 00:47:04.694
You want a drink, darlin'?

500
00:47:04.772 --> 00:47:06.637
No, merci.

501
00:47:06.707 --> 00:47:08.069
Oh, Oui, oui, oui, merci.

502
00:47:08.142 --> 00:47:09.234
No, thank you.

503
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:12.972
Fuckin' said yes, thank you, now drink!

504
00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:20.617
You fucking...

505
00:47:21.789 --> 00:47:22.778
Rob!

506
00:47:22.856 --> 00:47:24.153
No!

507
00:47:30.531 --> 00:47:31.725
You wanna fuck her?

508
00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:33.027
Yeah.

509
00:47:34.535 --> 00:47:36.503
No, Rob.

510
00:47:38.138 --> 00:47:40.297
Now, what was that?

511
00:47:42.209 --> 00:47:44.837
She said she's 2 months pregnant.

512
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.175
She's 2 months pregnant.

513
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:51.950
Oh, is that right?
You... You knocked up?


514
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:57.020
Yeah.

515
00:48:05.232 --> 00:48:07.200
- Make any difference to you?
- No.


516
00:48:07.902 --> 00:48:09.491
Yeah, well...

517
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.128
Brett here, he ain't fussy.

518
00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:14.897
I don't think he's ever
had a female human before.

519
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:17.802
Rob!

520
00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:33.657
You wanna fuck her now, too?

521
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.691
Yeah.

522
00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:40.460
But you squirt your business in the dirt.

523
00:48:40.534 --> 00:48:43.128
I'm not going sloppy seconds.

524
00:48:45.038 --> 00:48:46.562
Shit!

525
00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:59.051
What the fuck's goin' on in here?

526
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.044
Well, Pa, we was, um...

527
00:49:16.103 --> 00:49:18.094
What's this?

528
00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:21.664
Um, these 2 busted into the house.

529
00:49:21.742 --> 00:49:24.470
That's not true.

530
00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:31.412
What's she doing half naked?

531
00:49:31.485 --> 00:49:34.249
Brett and me, we was...
we was gonna fuck her.


532
00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:36.983
Thought it'd be all right.

533
00:49:40.827 --> 00:49:43.022
Why aren't they tied up?

534
00:49:43.096 --> 00:49:46.190
He's not goin' anywhere, Papa.
I busted his leg.


535
00:49:46.266 --> 00:49:48.359
Look. Have a look.

536
00:50:07.454 --> 00:50:09.718
- Where's Honky?
- Uh, he's...


537
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.910
He found something to roll, and he's fucking
outside somewhere. He'll be back.


538
00:50:13.927 --> 00:50:15.187
Hey, Pop,

539
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.594
she's a French chick, ain't she, Jim?

540
00:50:17.664 --> 00:50:21.293
Get her to say something.
Go on, Pop. Go on.


541
00:50:29.009 --> 00:50:32.809
You ain't gonna run off
on us, are ya, baby?

542
00:50:32.879 --> 00:50:35.177
That'd be dangerous.

543
00:50:35.248 --> 00:50:40.314
You see, that dog of ours kind
of has this thing about new blood.

544
00:50:40.387 --> 00:50:42.878
You haven't got your
period coming, have ya, baby?

545
00:50:44.358 --> 00:50:47.657
Honky'd have a goddamn party
if you were on the rags.

546
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.689
With a dog like that, see,

547
00:50:54.101 --> 00:50:58.629
once he chomps down and
them big jaws lock on...

548
00:50:58.705 --> 00:51:02.505
and right after the job's finished,

549
00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:05.067
you can't pry him off with a crowbar.

550
00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:26.324
I see you didn't lock the shed
this avo like I fucking told ya.

551
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.927
You know how that complicates things, don't ya?

552
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:32.836
Eh, cool dick?

553
00:51:33.407 --> 00:51:36.069
Oh, no, please.

554
00:51:36.143 --> 00:51:39.408
- I told him...
- Shut the... Fucking shut up!


555
00:51:46.653 --> 00:51:51.022
You see, I just been
out to the back shed,

556
00:51:51.091 --> 00:51:53.719
and someone...

557
00:51:53.794 --> 00:51:57.252
maybe an intruder and his buck-naked missus...

558
00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:03.096
got in there like Goldilocks
and turned the fucking sprinklers on.

559
00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:07.467
You got any idea what sort of
investment's out there in the shed,


560
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:11.068
going all moldy and fucking worthless?

561
00:52:17.517 --> 00:52:20.042
I'll see you inside, sunshine.

562
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.985
We're gonna have a little fuckin' talk.

563
00:52:28.361 --> 00:52:29.658
I fuckin' told him...

564
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:32.493
I fuckin' told him, shut the fuckin' door.

565
00:52:34.668 --> 00:52:38.502
We'll work out what we're gonna
do with them in the morning.

566
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.106
Now get me a drink.

567
00:52:58.758 --> 00:53:01.420
Honky'll be back in a minute.

568
00:53:01.495 --> 00:53:03.725
He likes to keep just outside the door.

569
00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:07.790
You wanna be real careful going outside.

570
00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:20.905
Now what was that for?

571
00:53:26.419 --> 00:53:27.419
Fuck!

572
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:41.428
Let's just forget about all the bud
just gone down the fuckin' toilet.


573
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:43.833
You know I've got prior convictions.

574
00:53:43.904 --> 00:53:46.236
If I get picked up
for this, then I'm fucked!

575
00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:49.002
And if I'm fucked, you're double-fucked!

576
00:53:49.075 --> 00:53:53.708
'Cause you two will starve Iike a pair
of orphaned puppies. Wouldn't ya?


577
00:53:54.213 --> 00:53:55.508
Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:53:55.582 --> 00:53:57.106
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes, Poppy.


579
00:53:57.184 --> 00:53:59.982
Oh, oh, y-y-yeah, Poppy.

580
00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:04.421
Have a look at youse.

581
00:54:05.859 --> 00:54:07.349
Me 2 sons.

582
00:54:07.427 --> 00:54:10.487
Christ Al-fuckin'-mighty.

583
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.966
So, what... what are we
gonna do about it, Pop?

584
00:54:20.407 --> 00:54:22.272
What do you fuckin' reckon?

585
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.337
Honky!

586
00:55:34.481 --> 00:55:35.812
Honky!

587
00:55:57.169 --> 00:55:58.399
Honky!

588
00:56:04.243 --> 00:56:05.975
Honky!

589
00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:07.809
Where the fuck are ya, boy?

590
00:56:16.556 --> 00:56:19.957
Don't move. Don't move, honey.

591
00:56:21.227 --> 00:56:22.694
What happened?

592
00:56:25.265 --> 00:56:27.393
They broke your leg.

593
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:31.835
Did they touch you?

594
00:56:31.905 --> 00:56:33.967
Did they touch you?

595
00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:35.873
No.

596
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:45.540
Where are they?

597
00:56:45.453 --> 00:56:49.244
In the house. But they'll be back.
The father's awake.


598
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:52.217
What are you doing?

599
00:56:53.259 --> 00:56:55.250
Personal security.

600
00:56:59.065 --> 00:57:00.999
What is that?

601
00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:03.058
A surprise.

602
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.298
- Jesus Christ Almighty.
- What?


603
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:11.969
Are you going to stop them from
putting their dicks inside of me?


604
00:57:13.245 --> 00:57:14.013
Maybe we...

605
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.605
Maybe what? Maybe what?

606
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:19.213
Maybe the cops will magically turn up?

607
00:57:19.286 --> 00:57:21.579
Or maybe we should wait
for divine intervention to save us?

608
00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:24.885
So God will strike them dead. 
Shall we do that?

609
00:57:24.858 --> 00:57:27.256
How do we stop them
without just making them crazier?

610
00:57:27.327 --> 00:57:28.692
I'm not a fighter. Are you?

611
00:57:30.463 --> 00:57:32.060
We're gonna get out of here.

612
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:38.990
My father said to me once,

613
00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:42.323
"To catch a mad dog,

614
00:59:42.395 --> 00:59:44.420
you must think like a mad dog...

615
00:59:48.234 --> 00:59:50.225
only madder."

616
01:00:27.106 --> 01:00:28.835
Honky!

617
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.601
Go see what that fuckin' mongrel's up to.

618
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.581
I don't want him fuckin'
with them till I say.

619
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.550
Ah, yeah, Pop.

620
01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:44.086
You can have the bloke,
but you leave me the sheila.

621
01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:46.788
Right, yeah, Pop.

622
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.636
Honky!

623
01:01:56.529 --> 01:01:59.828
Hey. Hey!

624
01:02:00.399 --> 01:02:02.129
What's wrong with him?

625
01:02:04.237 --> 01:02:06.000
I think he's in shock.

626
01:02:06.072 --> 01:02:08.734
Christ, it's only a busted leg.

627
01:02:15.348 --> 01:02:17.182
Your father hit you because of me?

628
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.842
It's all right, doll.

629
01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:21.950
We'll call it even when
I pop Volvo here, eh?

630
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.985
You wanna kill him, huh?

631
01:02:24.757 --> 01:02:26.633
You wanna kill him.

632
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.834
I don't believe this.

633
01:02:28.928 --> 01:02:31.961
When I look deep in your eyes, I can
see that you follow your brother.


634
01:02:32.031 --> 01:02:35.428
But you're not like him.
You do not even look like him.


635
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:37.835
- Well, we got different mothers.
- You see, I'm right.


636
01:02:37.804 --> 01:02:39.969
You're different than him.

637
01:02:41.374 --> 01:02:44.966
- Where is your mom now?
- She's gone.


638
01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:48.546
Poppy says women are
only good for gettin' fucked.

639
01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:51.500
Then they eventually try and fuck you.
So I guess he was finished with her.


640
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.714
No. No. Poppy's wrong.

641
01:02:57.824 --> 01:03:00.054
- No. No.
- Poppy's wrong.


642
01:03:00.126 --> 01:03:02.822
Maybe your mom loves you.
Maybe she wants to be with you.


643
01:03:02.895 --> 01:03:06.797
Shut up! Don't you fucking come
in here telling me what's what!

644
01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:10.131
You say fucking bye to him now!

645
01:03:13.673 --> 01:03:15.163
What the fuck?

646
01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:39.391
Poppy!

647
01:03:39.465 --> 01:03:42.730
No, no, no, no! No!

648
01:03:49.175 --> 01:03:50.335
Poppy!

649
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.671
Here!

650
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.739
Hit him!

651
01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:56.881
Hit the fucker!

652
01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:00.609
Kill him!

653
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.020
Kill him!

654
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.880
Brett!

655
01:04:42.528 --> 01:04:44.018
Honky!

656
01:04:50.536 --> 01:04:53.471
You're not in there
fuckin' that Frenchie, are ya?

657
01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:04.405
Brett!

658
01:06:13.252 --> 01:06:16.253
Jimmy, get me a drink.

659
01:06:16.322 --> 01:06:18.313
There you go, Pop.

660
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:25.626
Go get that yuppie mo in here.

661
01:06:25.698 --> 01:06:27.689
Yeah, Pop.

662
01:06:46.819 --> 01:06:49.447
Up. Up!

663
01:06:49.522 --> 01:06:51.854
Come on. Just you.

664
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:01.966
Now, where's Brett?

665
01:07:02.034 --> 01:07:04.502
I don't know.

666
01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:08.270
Poppy wants to see you in the house.

667
01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:15.005
How you doin' there, slick?

668
01:07:16.015 --> 01:07:18.950
Are ya comfortable? Eh?

669
01:07:20.753 --> 01:07:22.819
How's that little leg of yours?

670
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:28.453
That's gotta hurt.

671
01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:35.293
Stop it! You Fucking pig!

672
01:07:36.535 --> 01:07:38.503
What's that, eh?

673
01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.725
Ah, now, where you goin', darlin'?

674
01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:08.062
Can't wait for Poppy's good lovin', eh?

675
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:14.765
This way. This way.

676
01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:32.675
Poppy likes it if you
make a bit of an effort.

677
01:09:34.019 --> 01:09:36.613
You don't mind, do ya?

678
01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:38.247
For Poppy.

679
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.147
You are such a beautiful girl.

680
01:10:08.521 --> 01:10:10.986
It's a shame.

681
01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.952
Find him.

682
01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:38.979
Yeah?

683
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:24.525
I had me a missus once.

684
01:11:26.298 --> 01:11:28.858
A big coon sheila.

685
01:11:30.135 --> 01:11:31.796
Black velvet.

686
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:38.434
This is before Brett's mom and after Jimmy's.

687
01:12:04.803 --> 01:12:08.466
She wasn't a classy unit like yourself.

688
01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:12.703
But she was good
on a real dark night.

689
01:12:37.136 --> 01:12:39.431
Pity I had to put her down.

690
01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:57.551
I opened up her throat and
bled her like a fuckin' pig.

691
01:12:58.757 --> 01:13:02.386
Hung her out there in
the shed for a month.

692
01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:08.159
Christ, the stink.

693
01:13:10.336 --> 01:13:13.669
She smelled bad enough when she was alive.

694
01:13:19.778 --> 01:13:23.041
Had to put her through
the mulcher in the end.

695
01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:27.981
Turned her into fertilizer...

696
01:13:30.055 --> 01:13:32.683
and dog food.

697
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:37.358
Finally found a use for the bitch.

698
01:13:49.241 --> 01:13:51.973
You know why I stuck her?

699
01:13:59.151 --> 01:14:01.342
She didn't follow the rules.

700
01:14:02.654 --> 01:14:04.090
Yeah.

701
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.519
No.

702
01:14:07.593 --> 01:14:09.487
That's good, but, no.

703
01:14:15.501 --> 01:14:18.436
I guess I just did it

704
01:14:18.604 --> 01:14:22.035
so she wouldn't have
to suffer like the others.

705
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:30.178
We're gonna be gone around New Year's. 
Aren't we, eh?

706
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:12.490
What the fuck did you do, bitch?

707
01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:18.658
Where you gonna hide, huh?

708
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:20.458
Where you gonna hide?

709
01:15:33.879 --> 01:15:35.642
Oh, shit!

710
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.318
You little fuck!

711
01:15:45.891 --> 01:15:48.291
Fee, fi, fo, fum!

712
01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:57.395
I smell the cunt
of a bitch gonna die!

713
01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:09.169
Fuck!

714
01:16:14.119 --> 01:16:16.314
We gotta hide. Now!

715
01:17:49.446 --> 01:17:50.676
Come on.

716
01:17:50.649 --> 01:17:52.339
Get in.

717
01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.979
Let's go.

718
01:18:01.994 --> 01:18:04.058
No! No!

719
01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:05.990
No! No!

720
01:18:06.364 --> 01:18:07.592
Fuck!

721
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.795
Fuckin' bitch!

722
01:18:44.969 --> 01:18:46.167
Fuck!

723
01:19:12.798 --> 01:19:14.126
Where...

724
01:19:33.718 --> 01:19:35.079
Good girl.

725
01:19:35.054 --> 01:19:38.122
Good girl! Come on! Come on!

726
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.782
Start it! Let's go!

727
01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:44.194
Come on! Come on! Come on!

728
01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:48.195
Fuck! Fuck!

729
01:19:48.266 --> 01:19:49.563
Come on!

730
01:19:50.635 --> 01:19:52.500
Come on!

731
01:19:52.571 --> 01:19:55.506
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

732
01:19:57.676 --> 01:19:59.974
Come on!

733
01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.672
Come on!

734
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.446
No.

735
01:20:07.819 --> 01:20:10.652
Good boy. It's me. Good boy.

736
01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:12.952
Stay! Stay!

737
01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:27.735
Get her! Get her!

738
01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:30.675
- Fuck!
- Get her!


739
01:20:30.742 --> 01:20:33.176
Get her! Get her!

740
01:20:44.856 --> 01:20:46.255
Poppy!

741
01:20:52.063 --> 01:20:53.223
Yes!

742
01:20:53.298 --> 01:20:55.789
Go! Get out! Get out!

743
01:21:05.644 --> 01:21:07.468
Back it up!

744
01:21:10.014 --> 01:21:11.908
Come on!

745
01:21:12.383 --> 01:21:13.976
Quick! Drive!

746
01:21:14.052 --> 01:21:15.310
Go!

747
01:21:17.055 --> 01:21:18.545
Fuck!

748
01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:25.957
Reverse!

749
01:21:29.234 --> 01:21:30.724
Fuck!

750
01:21:43.515 --> 01:21:46.075
Come on! Come on!

751
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.984
- Fuck!

752
01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:45.341
You filth must die!

753
01:22:47.612 --> 01:22:49.842
Come on, cunt!

754
01:22:49.915 --> 01:22:51.746
Come on, you fuckers!

I'll piss in your fucking skull!

756
01:23:03.529 --> 01:23:05.429
I see you!

757
01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:13.928
I'm gonna tear your fuckin'
eyes out and skull-fuck ya, bitch!
