It's me, Tom.
Remember?


8
00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:33.103
We met a couple of weeks ago.

9
00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:37.307
Think you were chatting
me up at the bar.


10
00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.010
Yeah, so I was thinking
there was this festival


11
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:43.413
this weekend in Ireland
that I'm going to,


12
00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:48.151
and I thought maybe...
okay, I'll call later, actually.

TOM: Listen, I didn't...
about this weekend,


16
00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.892
I didn't mean just you and I.
It's not like a date or anything.


17
00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:59.462
It's... there's going to be, like,
a whole bunch of us camping.


18
00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:03.199
So, yeah, bring some friends,
if you have any,


19
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.035
just in case we don't get along,

20

which we would, if you came.

Hello?

Quick. Quick. Let's get out of here.
Here, close the door.


26
00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:05.255
That was a nice pub.

27
00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:08.892
I think I counted 12 men,
seven dogs,

no women, and me.

29
00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:18.301
I thought since the festival
doesn't start tonight,


30
00:03:18.302 --> 00:03:20.470
there's no bands playing,

31
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.604
for a special treat...

32
00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:26.174
I've booked a hotel.

33
00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.981
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.


34
00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.753
- You cheeky fuck.
- Ow.

already foreplay.


36
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.090
You said we were going up
to the festival tonight.


37
00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:43.159
- That was the plan.
- Yes...


38
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.361
Now I have friends
up there camping,


39
00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:47.195
thinking we're on our way.

40
00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:50.499
It's our two-week anniversary.

Remember?

42
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.872
Oh, you can't have
a two-week anniversary.


43
00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:58.575
It's a nice hotel.
Look in the glove box.


44
00:03:58.576 --> 00:04:00.316
I printed out some stuff
from the website.


45
00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:03.879
Go on, look at it.

in the Emerald Isle."


47

Mm-hmm. That's why I booked it.

48
00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.261
Forgot to say
you look really nice today.

You mean it?

52
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.442
- Yeah.
- Okay.


53
00:04:32.443 --> 00:04:35.144
We have to wait here until 7:00,

54
00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:38.147
and then someone's gonna come
and show us the way.


55
00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:39.716
That's what I arranged.

56
00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:41.718
What if I said no?

57
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.020
I thought I was being
vaguely romantic.

That's him?

61
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.560
I guess so.

62
00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.164
All right, wait.
Whew.


63

LUCY: You know, I was chatted up
on the way to the toilet.


64
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.184
Oh, yeah?

65
00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:17.854
Barman thought that I was

66
00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:21.658
a "strong, fine-looking
young thing."


67
00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:22.958
That's a good line.

68
00:05:26.796 --> 00:05:29.365
What? You want me to go back?

(CHUCKLES)

70
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.168
You want me to go back
and have words?


71
00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.337
I'll have a stern word
in that man's ear.


72
00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:37.573
I'll take him outside, and I'll hit him
right in the middle of the forehead.

(LAUGHS)

74
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.612
Well, whilst you were on the
toilet, some guy bumped into me


75
00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:45.781
and spilt my drink all over me,
on my new jumper.


76
00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:49.852
And then I ended up buying him
and all his friends a drink.

The whole pub?
Why?


78
00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:55.825
Well, he bumped into me,
spilt my drink on me,


79
00:05:55.826 --> 00:05:58.628
so I was like, "Excuse me,"
and he said it wasn't his fault,


80
00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.596
and I said,
"Well, it wasn't my fault."


81

And then it got a bit weird,

82
00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.167
and then he did offer
to buy me a drink,


83
00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:06.002
but by that point,
I was like, "Well, look",

I'll buy you
and your friends a drink,"

00:48:43.423 --> 00:48:47.326
he'll be out there right now.
He's the ringleader.


580
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:49.996
When he was a kid...

581
00:48:50.864 --> 00:48:53.901
took a notion to hide in the ditch
and wait for a car to come,


582
00:48:53.902 --> 00:48:55.769
and just when it was approaching,

583
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:59.038
he stepped out in front of it
just to see what would happen.


584
00:49:00.307 --> 00:49:04.444
Now, the driver hardly had time to brake.
I'm sure they tried.


585
00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:07.546
But to avoid hitting the kid,
they swerved off the road...


586
00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:13.285
crashed the car.
Driver was killed instantly.

This is the last place
in the world I want to be.

Why are you blaming me?

00:49:40.148 --> 00:49:41.648
There's no blame here, Tom.

593
00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:43.216

to figure out what happened.

the back, bleeding to death

after you hit me with the car.

596
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:48.155
It's not why you're bleeding.

597

I mean, I'm not all
there right now.

been fucking cut open.

look, you don't
know the way, but I do.


601
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.105
Which way?

602
00:50:05.106 --> 00:50:08.374
Go straight ahead, first right.

603
00:50:21.922 --> 00:50:24.090
Yeah, right. Right, Tom.

604
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:36.168
Left. Go left.

605
00:50:42.909 --> 00:50:45.478
Just keep going straight, Tom.

606
00:50:53.487 --> 00:50:55.554
Left.

607
00:51:17.277 --> 00:51:19.912
How the fuck did we come...?

608
00:51:22.471 --> 00:51:24.551
They'll still be out there.
I thought they would have


609
00:51:24.552 --> 00:51:25.986
given up by now and gone home.

610
00:51:25.987 --> 00:51:28.255
They've changed the signs around.

611
00:51:28.256 --> 00:51:31.091
Follow any of the signs, you'll come
back to exactly where you started.

You brought us here.
I followed your directions.

You did this.

614

What did you do to piss them off?

What?

616
00:51:39.434 --> 00:51:41.468
You must have done something.
Something's happened.


617

Now, what happened?

- What happened?

- No, we didn't provoke anyone.

Nah, something's happened.
What's happened?

Nothing fucking happened.

Did you say something to them?

626
00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:09.296
Nothing happened in the pub,
all right? Leave it.


627
00:52:09.297 --> 00:52:13.033
- Well, clearly something did.
- No, nothing happened in the pub.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

629
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.105
Lucy, what happened in the pub?

630
00:52:18.106 --> 00:52:19.906
- Someone...
- Did you say something to them?


631
00:52:19.907 --> 00:52:22.442
No, I didn't say anything to them.
Nothing happened in the pub.


632
00:52:22.443 --> 00:52:24.211
So what? Now, clearly
something happened.


633
00:52:24.212 --> 00:52:25.545
Tell him, Tom.

634
00:52:25.546 --> 00:52:29.249
Why are we having... why are we
having this conversation? Huh?


635
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.518
- You said something, didn't you?
- Tom, please.


636
00:52:31.519 --> 00:52:33.319
Lucy, tell me what happened.

637
00:52:34.454 --> 00:52:36.089
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

638
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:39.126
You provoked 'em, Tom.
Tom, what happened in the pub?


639
00:52:39.127 --> 00:52:40.594
Nothing happened in the pub.

640
00:52:40.595 --> 00:52:42.028
Then, why don't you want Lucy
to say anything?


641
00:52:42.029 --> 00:52:45.499
When it's going to be something
that's really stupid


642
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.768
- that you're going to be saying!
- What? I'm not saying anything...


643
00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:50.237
- (YELLS)
- MAX: Tom!


644
00:52:50.238 --> 00:52:51.659

- Tom, where are you going?

(SIGHING)

646
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.321
Wow.

647
00:53:08.322 --> 00:53:10.623
Really exploring his
maleness there.


648
00:53:11.925 --> 00:53:13.492
Is he always like that?

649
00:53:14.561 --> 00:53:17.329
- We only met two weeks ago.
- Oh.


650
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.336
Well, he did piss off
those men in the pub.


651
00:53:23.337 --> 00:53:26.873
They took offense, which is why
they're doing all this, of course.


652
00:53:26.874 --> 00:53:29.376
You were in the pub?

653
00:53:29.377 --> 00:53:32.378
I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I
didn't want to alarm anybody...


654
00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:35.482
but I saw Tom,

655
00:53:35.483 --> 00:53:37.551
and Tom spilled this man's pint.

656
00:53:37.552 --> 00:53:39.819
No.

657
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.621
No, no, no, no.
It was the other way around.


658
00:53:41.622 --> 00:53:43.757
No.

659
00:53:43.758 --> 00:53:45.992
Tom spilled a pint,

660
00:53:45.993 --> 00:53:47.694
and he was refusing
to buy another one


661
00:53:47.695 --> 00:53:52.231
until the man got real nasty
with your friend back there.


662
00:53:53.366 --> 00:53:55.168
Tom's not like that.

663
00:53:55.169 --> 00:53:57.637
He wouldn't...
he bought everyone a round.


664
00:53:57.638 --> 00:53:59.439
We joked about it.

665
00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.207
Yeah, I know it's confusing.

666
00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:10.082
Christ, this pain is getting worse.

667
00:54:12.152 --> 00:54:14.321
You wouldn't have any water
on you, would you?


668
00:54:14.322 --> 00:54:16.622
Yeah, by your feet.

669
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:20.626
Lucy, could you...?

670
00:54:40.213 --> 00:54:42.215
Thanks.

671
00:54:42.216 --> 00:54:44.216
It's fine.

672
00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:48.754
Couldn't open it for me, could you?

673
00:55:18.351 --> 00:55:20.887
MAX: You feel better, Tom?

674
00:55:20.888 --> 00:55:22.755
Do you want me to drive?

675
00:55:29.162 --> 00:55:31.063
No.

676
00:55:40.173 --> 00:55:41.974
I know where we are now.

677
00:55:42.909 --> 00:55:45.043
I can get us out.

678
00:55:46.313 --> 00:55:48.480
So let's go.

679
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:36.995
My... my head's
starting to bleed again.


680
00:56:37.997 --> 00:56:40.400
Would you have
a handkerchief or something?


681
00:56:40.401 --> 00:56:41.935
I don't want to bleed
all over your seats.


682
00:56:41.936 --> 00:56:43.236
No, I haven't.

683
00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:44.771
Oh, you wouldn't
check the glove box?


684
00:56:44.772 --> 00:56:48.240
It's just that I don't want to
ruin all of your upholstery.


685
00:57:02.255 --> 00:57:04.423
What's that, Lucy?

686
00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:08.828
LUCY: It's a fire hazard warning.

687
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:11.131
Where'd you get that?

688
00:57:11.132 --> 00:57:13.032
Tom threw it out the window.

689
00:57:13.033 --> 00:57:15.634
Huh. That's strange.

690
00:57:16.469 --> 00:57:19.304
LUCY:
Did you cut your own face, Max?


691
00:57:21.241 --> 00:57:23.510
You took my clothes,
pulled my hair.


692
00:57:23.511 --> 00:57:25.378
- I did it all.
- You dragged me out of the car.


693
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:27.013
I cut the tree.

694
00:57:27.014 --> 00:57:29.781
I even wrote on the fucking wall.

Where are we going?

I'll go straight through
the back of her fucking skull.

Can you feel that, Lucy?


705
00:57:52.206 --> 00:57:54.541
- I can feel it.
- There you go.

- Faster, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.

You're not trying, Tom.

I will kill her.

- MAX: Look at the road, Tom.

- I can't go any faster.
- Yes, you can. You can.

I can't go any faster,
or else I'll crash the car.

Do you want to crash the car,
