00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:05.116
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO MY FATHER

2
00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:09.490
RAISE OUR PENSIONS

3
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.796
WE WORKED OUR WHOLE LIVES

4
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:15.428
JUSTICE FOR PENSIONERS

5
00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:20.305
We want an increase!
We want an increase!


6
00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:35.185
We want to be heard.

7
00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:38.784
We're taxpaying citizens.

8
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.556
We're starving.

9
00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.722
We're tired of waiting.

10
00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:45.767
We want to see the minister.

11
00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:47.801
We want to see the minister.

12
00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.174
Silence!

13
00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.076
You don't have a permit.
You must disperse.


14
00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:25.196
Go home. Go on.

15
00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:28.509
You should be ashamed.

16
00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:31.705
The way you treat us is a disgrace!

17
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.907
Go home. Go on.

18
00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.921
Let's go, old geezers.
Come on.


19
00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:16.885
Keep him quiet, for God's sake!

20
00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:19.489
Quiet, Flike.

21
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.264
Scoundrels, all of them!

22
00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:29.964
Quiet or they'll hear you
and arrest you.


23
00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.734
I'm not talking about the police.

24
00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.866
I mean the organizers of the protest.

25
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.069
They should have gotten a permit.

26
00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:39.574
They wouldn't give us one.

27
00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:41.878
Then we should have stayed home!

28
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:46.283
A 20% increase
would be enough for me


29
00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:49.753
to pay off my debts in a year.

30
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.021
I don't have any debts.

31
00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:57.065
To tell the truth, 
I don't either.

32
00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:04.836
- This is our chance. We can go.
- Let's go.


33
00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:14.777
Good day.

34
00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:23.714
I have no one,
no son or brother, to help me out.


35
00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:26.158
I'm just a good-for-nothing old man.

36
00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:28.527
Orazio Valenti.

37
00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:30.689
Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

38
00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:34.429
Who can live
on 18,000 lire these days?


39
00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:39.099
My landlady charges me 10,000.
She even raised my rent, that old -


40
00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:42.106
Go ahead and say it.
We're both men.


41
00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:44.175
If she's a bitch, she's a bitch.

42
00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.978
Do you need a watch?

43
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:51.212
No, I have a watch.

44
00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:53.380
I don't have it with me,
but it's a very nice watch.


45
00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.787
I have two.
That's why I'm selling this one.


46
00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:03.223
What make is yours?

47
00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:06.928
It's nice.
It has a gold case.


48
00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:09.334
Well, here's where I live.
Good-bye.


49
00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:15.910
Good-bye.

50
00:07:34.857 --> 00:07:37.223
Who's done here?

51
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.694
How rude! I'm not finished.

52
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:41.155
Thank you.

53
00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:47.029
Waitress.

54
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.800
Listen to this.

55
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:54.801
In a store it would cost you

56
00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:05.209
- How much are you asking?
- 5,000 lire.


57
00:08:22.604 --> 00:08:24.731
My throat feels scratchy.

58
00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:28.402
- Be patient. It'll pass.
- I hope so.


59
00:08:36.452 --> 00:08:38.249
See you tomorrow.

60
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.151
Here we are. He's so cute.

61
00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:49.261
Hey, I saw everything.

62
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.629
Tomorrow I'll kick you out,
and your dog too.


63
00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:53.563
I'll kick you out, I said.

64
00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:55.364
You're overreacting.

65
00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:59.703
She'll lose all her customers.
Don't listen to a word she says.


66
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.010
- May I walk with you a while?
- Of course.


67
00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:09.241
You can have it for 4,000.

68
00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:12.010
4,000! That's a lot of money.

69
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.554
But a good watch lasts forever.

70
00:09:14.623 --> 00:09:18.150
I don't care.
Look, I'll give you 3,000 lire.


71
00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:23.062
There's more than that in here.
It's all in small change, I'm afraid.


72
00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.729
- I said 4,000.
- It's all in here.


73
00:09:27.536 --> 00:09:30.130
Listen, you can take the bag

74
00:09:30.806 --> 00:09:34.469
and give it back to me
tomorrow at the cafeteria.


75
00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:39.505
See you.

76
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.111
Spare some change.

77
00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:46.381
See you.

78
00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:55.520
Spare some change.

79
00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:22.986
Who's in my room?

80
00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:25.793
Who's in my room?
- How should I know?


81
00:10:26.028 --> 00:10:27.825
What's all this yelling?

82
00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:31.696
Be quiet and stop yelling.
How dare you behave like this!


83
00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:33.928
Quiet down and come with me.

84
00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:36.563
Get it through your head.

85
00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:40.107
It's not your room. It's mine.
- What do you mean, yours?


86
00:10:40.175 --> 00:10:42.871
They're dear friends of mine,
just resting for a while.


87
00:10:42.945 --> 00:10:44.310
And why bother making a fuss?

88
00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:46.313
You're leaving at the end
of the month anyway.


89
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.747
Leaving.

90
00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:52.351
What a way to treat someone -
kicking him out after 20 years!


91
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:55.618
Watch me!
Meanwhile, pay your back rent.


92
00:10:55.691 --> 00:10:58.182
I have the money right here!

93
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.057
Stop yelling!

94
00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:13.265
Who's she think
she's going to kick out?


95
00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:15.971
Where would I go?

96
00:11:16.044 --> 00:11:17.477
They skin you alive.

97
00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:21.175
They want 20,000 lire for a rat hole,
and then it's full of rodents.


98
00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:23.240
- I know.
- Kick me out!


99
00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:18.128
She charges 1,000 lire
an hour for the room, you know.


100
00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:22.967
1,000 lire every time.

101
00:12:31.086 --> 00:12:33.816
- Could you give me the thermometer?
- Yes.


102
00:12:53.909 --> 00:12:55.376
Here.

103
00:12:56.878 --> 00:12:58.709
Do you feel sick?

104
00:13:00.348 --> 00:13:01.838
Not too hard.

105
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:04.710
Did you hear the door just now?

106
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.381
She put them in the living room.

107
00:13:07.622 --> 00:13:09.146
She could have done that before.

108
00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:11.725
No, she couldn't.
There were two others in there.


109
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.525
The dirty, rotten -

110
00:13:39.054 --> 00:13:41.454
Have you seen all the ants?

111
00:13:43.992 --> 00:13:46.017
Can you see anything,
Mr. Umberto?


112
00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:48.892
No, nothing.

113
00:13:50.165 --> 00:13:53.225
You can a little.
Did you know I'm pregnant?


114
00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:57.732
My God.

115
00:13:58.406 --> 00:14:00.067
And you say it just like that?

116
00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:03.142
How do you want me to say it?

117
00:14:08.784 --> 00:14:11.981
- Does she know?
- God forbid.


118
00:14:48.323 --> 00:14:50.223
<i>You can go in now.</i>

119
00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.768
Are you sure?

120
00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:03.800
Three months, Mr. Umberto.

121
00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:05.953
- Excuse me.
- Come in.


122
00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.922
Come see.

123
00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.192
Look.

124
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:49.233
The tall one is from Naples.
The short one is from Florence.


125
00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:52.668
- Which one is yours?
- Both of them.


126
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:56.536
Which is the father?

127
00:17:58.213 --> 00:18:01.205
I think... the one from Naples.

128
00:18:02.384 --> 00:18:04.511
What do you mean, you think?

129
00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:07.514
They both deny it.

130
00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:37.479
Come here.

131
00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:40.682
Come on. She's crying.

132
00:18:48.329 --> 00:18:51.730
Answer me!

133
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.038
She's done singing.

134
00:18:59.174 --> 00:19:01.802
Bring me a hot water bottle.

135
00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:12.676
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>He wants some hot water.</i>


136
00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:15.049
Come on.

137
00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:17.317
Good boy.

138
00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:23.093
Do you want to play
with the ball, Flike?


139
00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:29.668
Come in.

140
00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:31.170
I pay the maid.

141
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:34.003
If you want hot water,
hire your own maid.


142
00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:39.246
I'm throwing your things out
on the 30th.


143
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.142
I'm evicting you.

144
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.700
Kiss the baby for me.

145
00:20:26.628 --> 00:20:28.619
Did you hear me?

146
00:20:34.469 --> 00:20:36.869
Come here, boy.

147
00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:39.602
Good boy, Flike.

148
00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:47.239
Damn these ants!

149
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:50.347
Ants everywhere.

150
00:20:54.189 --> 00:20:56.555
- What is it?
- Where's the thermometer?


151
00:20:56.624 --> 00:20:58.489
On the dresser.

152
00:21:06.501 --> 00:21:09.959
I have to put it back.
Otherwise, she'll yell at me.


153
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.430
Come here, please.

154
00:21:13.508 --> 00:21:15.237
What do you want?

155
00:21:20.215 --> 00:21:22.479
Take a look.

156
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.279
What do I have to do?

157
00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:28.413
Look in my throat and tell me
if you see a white coating.


158
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.350
It's so big.

159
00:21:32.427 --> 00:21:34.486
Is there a coating?

160
00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:43.194
She's hoping I'll die,
but I'm not going to.


161
00:21:57.852 --> 00:21:59.786
Take this to her.

162
00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:02.855
That's 3,000 lire.

163
00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:06.325
And get a receipt.

164
00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:08.957
All right.

165
00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:36.479
Mr. Umberto.

166
00:22:40.094 --> 00:22:41.561
Mr. Umberto.

167
00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:46.032
She says you owe her 15,000,
and it's all or nothing.


168
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.000
I've got to go,
or she'll yell at me.


169
00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:28.569
Good evening.

170
00:23:29.544 --> 00:23:30.875
How about 2,500?

171
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.907
I said 2,000 yesterday,
and I say 2,000 today.


172
00:23:35.983 --> 00:23:37.951
How about 2,400?

173
00:23:40.722 --> 00:23:44.385
They have great sentimental value.
They're practically new.


174
00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:47.451
I've never opened them
because I didn't want to ruin them.


175
00:24:01.943 --> 00:24:04.673
I'm only giving them to you
because I have a fever.


176
00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:27.858
Maria.

177
00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:30.299
These ants are driving me crazy.

178
00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:32.968
2,000...

179
00:24:34.976 --> 00:24:36.136
4,000...

180
00:24:39.013 --> 00:24:40.275
5,000.

181
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:42.873
She'll have the rest
when I get my pension.


182
00:24:48.156 --> 00:24:51.523
Get me the thermometer.
She's made my fever go up.


183
00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:54.727
15,000.

184
00:24:54.896 --> 00:24:59.162
To pay my debts, I'd have to go
a month without food.


185
00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:04.327
Did you do your assignment?

186
00:25:06.073 --> 00:25:08.303
You didn't have time, eh?

187
00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:13.536
Certain things can happen
if you don't know your grammar.


188
00:25:14.182 --> 00:25:17.515
Everyone takes advantage
of the ignorant.


189
00:26:10.104 --> 00:26:13.540
Now there's more. You'll have
to wait till the 27th for the rest.


190
00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:18.204
This is ridiculous.
First 3,000, then 2,000 more.


191
00:26:19.313 --> 00:26:22.714
Take them back to him.
It's all or nothing.


192
00:26:22.783 --> 00:26:25.843
Either he gives me 15,000 lire
or I evict him. Go.


193
00:26:36.097 --> 00:26:37.655
Well?

194
00:26:47.608 --> 00:26:51.237
- <i>Good evening.</i>
- <i>Good evening. Go right in.</i>


195
00:26:59.654 --> 00:27:01.178
Excuse me.

196
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:03.757
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Down there.</i>


197
00:27:03.824 --> 00:27:06.088
<i>Madam is at the end of the corridor.</i>

198
00:27:06.594 --> 00:27:07.822
Maria, shut the door!

199
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.691
Her fiance.

200
00:29:34.408 --> 00:29:38.538
I was the only successful one
in all Macerata.


201
00:29:51.225 --> 00:29:52.920
<i>Good-bye.</i>

202
00:29:53.794 --> 00:29:55.455
<i>Till tomorrow.</i>

203
00:32:03.557 --> 00:32:04.990
Yes.

204
00:32:06.026 --> 00:32:07.891
What is it?

205
00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:15.029
Yes, a cold.
San Martino della Battaglia 14.


206
00:32:15.102 --> 00:32:17.093
Third floor.

207
00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:20.735
Thank you.

208
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:57.175
What's going on?

209
00:36:57.251 --> 00:36:59.378
Come in.

210
00:37:02.623 --> 00:37:04.250
Stay there. I'll come to you.

211
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.788
Who's Mr. Ferrari?

212
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:09.089
I am.

213
00:37:09.163 --> 00:37:12.030
I got dressed
so I wouldn't keep you waiting.


214
00:37:28.582 --> 00:37:31.278
Sorry. Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

215
00:37:31.518 --> 00:37:33.383
Spalmagulli, Armando.

216
00:37:33.453 --> 00:37:35.751
Please, come in.

217
00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:41.551
I'll just shut my suitcase
and then I'm ready.


218
00:37:44.798 --> 00:37:48.165
Mr. Umberto, are you seriously ill?

219
00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:52.696
Yes, it's serious.

220
00:37:54.474 --> 00:37:55.998
Serious.

221
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.810
- You're leaving us in the dark over here.
- Shut up.


222
00:38:02.883 --> 00:38:04.942
Are you kidding?

223
00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:07.111
What are you looking at?

224
00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:12.048
6:30.

225
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.693
Come here. Good boy.

226
00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:21.195
If he realizes I'm leaving,
it'll be the end.


227
00:38:21.435 --> 00:38:23.300
Down, boy.

228
00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:28.297
Do me a favor.

229
00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:31.909
Play with the dog a little.
Here's a ball and ruler.


230
00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:34.137
I don't feel like playing.

231
00:38:34.214 --> 00:38:38.241
I can't say good-bye to him,
or he won't let me leave.


232
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:39.683
Very well.

233
00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:42.520
Go on, boy.

234
00:38:46.059 --> 00:38:49.790
- What are you doing?
- Come and play with the ruler.


235
00:38:51.932 --> 00:38:55.368
- Is your boyfriend down there?
- Leave me alone.


236
00:38:55.435 --> 00:38:57.403
Mr. Umberto.

237
00:39:09.082 --> 00:39:11.983
Don't give him any milk, all right?

238
00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:14.087
And please keep an eye on him.

239
00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:15.586
All right.

240
00:39:21.395 --> 00:39:23.625
He's fine. He's playing.

241
00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:28.328
Please take care of him.
I won't forget you.


242
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:30.434
I won't be gone long.

243
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.367
Shall we go, Mr. Ferrari?

244
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:33.929
Yes.

245
00:39:34.007 --> 00:39:35.201
Give me your suitcase.

246
00:39:35.275 --> 00:39:38.210
No, it's very light.
Just pajamas and a bar of soap.


247
00:39:38.278 --> 00:39:39.836
Keep it, then.

248
00:39:56.163 --> 00:39:57.653
Bye.

249
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.894
Maria!

250
00:40:36.503 --> 00:40:39.301
This guy's healthier than I am.
What's he doing here?


251
00:40:39.373 --> 00:40:42.604
I'd like to keep him a little longer,
so he can get the full treatment.


252
00:40:45.212 --> 00:40:46.645
All right.

253
00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:49.578
Thank you, Sister.

254
00:40:54.087 --> 00:40:55.076
Say "ah."

255
00:40:57.557 --> 00:40:58.649
That's fine.

256
00:40:58.725 --> 00:41:03.162
Brush his tonsils with iodine.
You can go home tomorrow.


257
00:41:04.197 --> 00:41:05.186
Excuse me, Doctor.

258
00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:06.596
What?

259
00:41:07.734 --> 00:41:09.292
I also have a pain here.

260
00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:13.870
What kind of pain?

261
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:19.000
Nothing.

262
00:41:20.547 --> 00:41:23.141
Can't you see your fever's gone?

263
00:41:23.216 --> 00:41:25.343
It's just common tonsillitis.

264
00:41:25.852 --> 00:41:28.650
If you were younger, I'd tell you
to have your tonsils taken out.


265
00:41:28.722 --> 00:41:31.953
But what's the use, at your age?

266
00:41:38.165 --> 00:41:40.065
You should have insisted.

267
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.397
Mr. Umberto,

268
00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:44.699
you should have insisted.

269
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:51.242
I'd really like to save
a little money, you know.


270
00:41:52.212 --> 00:41:54.544
I'll teach you how to get them
to let you stay here.


271
00:41:55.248 --> 00:41:58.877
All I need is one week.

272
00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:01.512
This ward is better than a hotel.

273
00:42:02.789 --> 00:42:04.552
Did you ask the nun for a rosary?

274
00:42:07.994 --> 00:42:10.019
Thank you. Oh, Sister-

275
00:42:11.665 --> 00:42:14.225
He's such a nice person.

276
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:17.031
He'd like to stay a little longer.

277
00:42:17.103 --> 00:42:20.231
He needs more treatment.
Can't you see how haggard he looks?


278
00:42:20.307 --> 00:42:24.505
Just imagine: His pension isn't
even enough to support his dog.


279
00:42:30.317 --> 00:42:31.682
We'll see.

280
00:42:32.285 --> 00:42:34.116
Thank you, Sister.

281
00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:36.587
Ask her for a rosary.

282
00:42:36.723 --> 00:42:37.849
Sister.

283
00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:40.783
Could I have a rosary?

284
00:43:15.729 --> 00:43:17.754
How are you, my dear?

285
00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:19.696
I'm fine.

286
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:22.964
This was all I could bring.

287
00:43:24.804 --> 00:43:26.601
A banana!

288
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.307
Sit down, dear.
Pull up that stool.


289
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:36.980
May I sit here?

290
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.312
Of course. Sit down.

291
00:43:40.053 --> 00:43:42.647
What about Flike? How is he?

292
00:43:42.722 --> 00:43:46.021
I wanted to bring him upstairs,
but it's not allowed.


293
00:43:47.394 --> 00:43:50.295
He's downstairs in the courtyard.
- In the courtyard.


294
00:43:50.363 --> 00:43:52.831
Flike's in the courtyard.

295
00:44:19.426 --> 00:44:22.520
Shut that window!

296
00:44:28.101 --> 00:44:29.591
Shut it!

297
00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:10.669
So, is that the father?

298
00:45:13.313 --> 00:45:14.974
Mr. Umberto,

299
00:45:15.215 --> 00:45:17.547
if you asked me
to swear to it, I couldn't.


300
00:45:18.752 --> 00:45:20.379
But I sense it was him.

301
00:45:21.254 --> 00:45:23.518
What does he have to say?

302
00:45:24.457 --> 00:45:26.254
Nothing.

303
00:45:26.326 --> 00:45:29.955
When I come back, 
I'll make him talk.

304
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.260
I'll talk to both of them.

305
00:45:32.332 --> 00:45:35.062
Even the short one,
the one from Florence.


306
00:45:35.135 --> 00:45:36.227
Both of them.

307
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.897
Give us another one, Sister.

308
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.811
Good morning, Sister.

309
00:45:53.687 --> 00:45:54.745
Your daughter?

310
00:46:00.093 --> 00:46:02.584
Excuse me, Sister.

311
00:46:02.662 --> 00:46:04.425
How is our father?

312
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:05.957
He's very ill.

313
00:46:15.542 --> 00:46:20.707
So he asked to borrow 4,000 lire,
but I didn't give him a cent.


314
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.270
Good move.

315
00:46:23.216 --> 00:46:25.446
Yes, she's marrying the manager
of the movie theater.


316
00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:27.418
That way she can get in for free.

317
00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:30.980
I hope she doesn't have children.

318
00:46:31.057 --> 00:46:34.117
She says you have to leave
because she needs your room.


319
00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:35.661
That's why she's getting married.

320
00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:37.993
Absolutely not.

321
00:46:38.231 --> 00:46:40.927
I'm paying my back rent,
so she can't kick me out.


322
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.490
She can't evict me.

323
00:46:42.569 --> 00:46:44.594
Mr. Umberto, he's waiting.

324
00:46:44.671 --> 00:46:47.162
I'm not going to the shelter.

325
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.231
Get well soon, Mr. Umberto.

326
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:51.675
- Tell her I'm not going.
- Yes, I'll tell her.


327
00:46:51.745 --> 00:46:56.148
Let her go to the shelter.
I'm not going!


328
00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:25.769
During the war
she called me Grandpa.


329
00:47:25.845 --> 00:47:29.406
I gave her some meat
from time to time.


330
00:47:29.482 --> 00:47:32.144
After the war she went crazy.

331
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.679
She even hates my dog.

332
00:47:35.755 --> 00:47:38.280
If you saw my dog,
you'd know it's impossible to hate him.


333
00:48:01.447 --> 00:48:03.972
Take care of yourself, Mr. Umberto.

334
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.508
But I'm coming back here, you know.
I'm gonna try again.


335
00:48:07.587 --> 00:48:08.611
Good luck.

336
00:48:08.688 --> 00:48:11.282
I'll come and visit you.
What's your address?


337
00:48:11.357 --> 00:48:14.986
- Via San Martino della Battaglia 14.
- That's where I'll find you, right?


338
00:48:15.061 --> 00:48:17.996
- Even the police couldn't get me out.
- That's the spirit!


339
00:48:18.064 --> 00:48:20.294
Good-bye, and good luck.

340
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:11.817
- Excuse me, isn't the maid here?
- No, but the lady of the house is.


341
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.498
What are you doing?

342
00:49:35.575 --> 00:49:36.769
I'm working.

343
00:49:36.843 --> 00:49:38.936
This is my room. I live here.

344
00:49:39.178 --> 00:49:40.805
Who said you didn't?

345
00:49:41.114 --> 00:49:43.082
What are you supposed to do here?

346
00:49:43.149 --> 00:49:45.014
A lot of stuff.

347
00:49:54.961 --> 00:49:57.327
Excuse me.
Did the maid go out with the dog?


348
00:49:57.397 --> 00:49:58.386
What dog?

349
00:49:58.531 --> 00:50:00.226
My dog!

350
00:50:00.667 --> 00:50:03.431
I'm not here
to keep an eye on the dog.


351
00:50:30.096 --> 00:50:32.189
I'm pregnant. You understand?

352
00:50:39.138 --> 00:50:40.730
Good morning.

353
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.313
- Where's Flike?
- I don't know.


354
00:50:50.383 --> 00:50:52.908
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.


355
00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:54.886
Don't make me shout.
Where's Flike?


356
00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:57.218
Madam opened the door and he left.

357
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.087
Where were you, you fool?

358
00:50:59.158 --> 00:51:01.251
I kept the door shut,
but she kept opening it.


359
00:51:01.327 --> 00:51:04.763
If anything's happened to him,
I'll kill her.


360
00:51:19.445 --> 00:51:21.174
Please hurry.

361
00:51:21.247 --> 00:51:24.842
- What if I run someone over?
- I'll pay the damages. Just hurry.


362
00:51:34.293 --> 00:51:36.284
- How much?
- 200 lire.


363
00:51:36.362 --> 00:51:38.296
- Here.
- I don't have change.


364
00:51:44.404 --> 00:51:46.099
Do you have change for 1,000 lire?

365
00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:54.045
Could you make change
for 1,000 lire?


366
00:51:57.183 --> 00:51:58.844
Give me that glass.

367
00:51:58.918 --> 00:51:59.976
- This one?
- Yes.


368
00:52:03.923 --> 00:52:06.949
Fifty lire. 950 is your change.

369
00:52:19.038 --> 00:52:20.528
- There.
- Thank you.


370
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.576
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my dog.


371
00:52:26.646 --> 00:52:28.136
You're number 15.

372
00:52:57.009 --> 00:52:59.034
Excuse me.
Is this where you kill them?


373
00:53:09.188 --> 00:53:10.678
Thirteen.

374
00:53:19.765 --> 00:53:21.255
Fourteen.

375
00:53:26.706 --> 00:53:28.298
Fifteen.

376
00:53:30.042 --> 00:53:31.236
Sixteen.

377
00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:34.845
Fifteen.

378
00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:41.078
- Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye.


379
00:53:42.989 --> 00:53:43.751
Yes?

380
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:47.525
A mutt with intelligent eyes.

381
00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:50.289
White with brown spots.

382
00:53:50.363 --> 00:53:52.422
He ran away from home.
- When?


383
00:53:53.933 --> 00:53:55.798
Yesterday,
or perhaps the day before.


384
00:53:58.237 --> 00:54:01.695
What do you wish to do?
Do you want the dog or not?


385
00:54:01.774 --> 00:54:06.268
- What if I don't take him?
- Then we'll have to kill him.


386
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.976
- You'll kill him.
- Filippo.


387
00:54:10.049 --> 00:54:11.573
Yes, sir.

388
00:54:12.218 --> 00:54:15.779
Take this gentleman to see
the dogs caught in the last two days.


389
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:17.954
- Come with me.
- Thank you.


390
00:54:18.024 --> 00:54:19.616
Well, what have you decided?

391
00:54:20.793 --> 00:54:22.488
So you'll kill him?

392
00:54:22.562 --> 00:54:24.496
We have to.
What else can we do with them?


393
00:54:28.935 --> 00:54:32.234
- But 450 lire...
- Next.


394
00:54:35.208 --> 00:54:37.836
We caught this one the day
before yesterday, that one yesterday.


395
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.071
That one the day before yesterday.

396
00:54:45.718 --> 00:54:47.015
That one ten days ago.

397
00:54:49.121 --> 00:54:50.986
This one yesterday.

398
00:54:51.691 --> 00:54:54.626
And this one the day before.
Watch out for the cart.


399
00:56:33.559 --> 00:56:36.653
See, he's not dead!

400
00:56:36.729 --> 00:56:39.391
Good evening, Mrs. Malantoni.
Good evening, sir.


401
00:56:40.433 --> 00:56:43.459
What do you want from me?

402
00:56:44.437 --> 00:56:47.065
We'll be going to your funeral,
not the other way around!


403
00:56:47.139 --> 00:56:49.198
You think I owe you something?

404
00:56:49.442 --> 00:56:51.808
What are you yelling about?

405
00:56:51.877 --> 00:56:55.540
You wretch! Pay your debts.

406
00:56:55.848 --> 00:56:56.974
My debts!

407
00:56:57.049 --> 00:57:00.712
That's not the reason
you want to kick me out.


408
00:57:00.786 --> 00:57:03.084
Tomorrow the doorman
will kick you out.


409
00:57:03.155 --> 00:57:06.090
There are laws, you know.
I pay my debts.


410
00:57:06.158 --> 00:57:10.822
I worked for the Ministry
of Public Works for 30 years!


411
00:57:14.533 --> 00:57:16.194
I've always paid my debts.

412
00:57:21.707 --> 00:57:23.265
Debts!

413
00:57:23.476 --> 00:57:25.467
She doesn't even know
what a bill is.


414
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.445
<i>I have seven people to support.</i>
<i>Spare some change, please.</i>


415
00:58:04.517 --> 00:58:08.613
I have seven dependents.
Spare some change.


416
00:58:10.623 --> 00:58:11.317
Thank you.

417
00:58:45.024 --> 00:58:46.582
Battistini.

418
00:58:48.093 --> 00:58:50.926
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

419
00:58:50.996 --> 00:58:52.657
So-so. How about you?

420
00:58:52.832 --> 00:58:56.598
I can't complain.
How are things?


421
00:58:56.669 --> 00:59:00.264
- You know. Getting by.
- Excuse me. I'm catching the bus.


422
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:06.341
I'll take the next one.

423
00:59:06.412 --> 00:59:08.710
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

424
00:59:10.015 --> 00:59:14.679
I'm having a dispute with my landlady.

425
00:59:14.753 --> 00:59:16.448
I'm sure I'm going to win.

426
00:59:17.523 --> 00:59:20.048
I'll get an injunction and stop her.

427
00:59:21.126 --> 00:59:25.927
I'll pay 7,500 lire and I'll stop her.

428
00:59:25.998 --> 00:59:28.694
All I need is half the money.

429
00:59:28.934 --> 00:59:30.595
I have to find 2,000 lire.

430
00:59:34.473 --> 00:59:38.273
- You're still at the same address?
- Yes, I'm not moving from there.


431
00:59:39.011 --> 00:59:43.141
The landlady would like
to kick me out right now.


432
00:59:43.215 --> 00:59:46.878
You understand?

433
00:59:48.354 --> 00:59:50.254
I'm sorry.
I don't want to miss my bus.


434
00:59:50.322 --> 00:59:53.553
Good-bye, Ferrari.
So nice to see you again.


435
01:00:00.399 --> 01:00:02.765
If you see Carloni,
give him my regards.


436
01:00:04.403 --> 01:00:06.769
- He's dead.
- Dead?


437
01:00:10.743 --> 01:00:11.971
Thank you.

438
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:15.403
Ma'am, I have two children.

439
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:16.613
Thank you.

440
01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:18.206
I have seven dependents.

441
01:02:13.465 --> 01:02:14.489
Be still.

442
01:02:37.222 --> 01:02:39.656
- Flike, what are you doing there?
- Commendatore!


443
01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:42.091
How are you, Commendatore?

444
01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:45.256
I was just wondering
what Flike was doing here.


445
01:02:48.233 --> 01:02:50.292
He's playing.
He plays all day long.


446
01:02:50.969 --> 01:02:53.233
He's so clever.
How adorable.


447
01:02:54.039 --> 01:02:55.336
He's so cute.

448
01:02:55.407 --> 01:02:56.840
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.


449
01:02:56.909 --> 01:02:59.707
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
- I can't. My bus is leaving.


450
01:02:59.778 --> 01:03:02.440
- Just a cup of coffee.
- No, thanks. The bus is leaving.


451
01:03:02.514 --> 01:03:06.177
- A drink. Something.
- Really, I'd love to, but I can't.


452
01:03:06.251 --> 01:03:10.483
- At least allow me to walk with you.
- Of course.


453
01:03:10.556 --> 01:03:13.218
What are you doing these days?
- Nothing.


454
01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:17.422
I'm a pensioner, so I'm just getting by.
I don't do anything.


455
01:03:17.496 --> 01:03:19.487
Lucky you, with nothing to do.

456
01:03:25.637 --> 01:03:27.468
You're late, sir.

457
01:03:53.565 --> 01:03:55.499
Do you think
there's going to be a war?


458
01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.867
Who knows?

459
01:04:03.909 --> 01:04:05.206
<i>We're leaving.</i>

460
01:04:05.744 --> 01:04:07.405
Good-bye.

461
01:04:22.227 --> 01:04:25.162
- Congratulations once again.
- Congratulations.


462
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.221
Thank you, dear.

463
01:04:32.104 --> 01:04:36.040
- All the best, dear.
- You promised to come visit us.


464
01:04:36.108 --> 01:04:39.043
- I promise.
- Come see how the baby has grown.


465
01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:41.272
All right.
Give the baby a kiss for me.


466
01:04:55.627 --> 01:04:57.390
- All the best.
- Thank you.


467
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:02.289
- All the best.
- Thank you. Good-bye.


468
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:15.647
Don't forget tomorrow,
and don't be late.


469
01:05:16.815 --> 01:05:19.045
We can't be late.

470
01:05:20.652 --> 01:05:22.244
Good-bye, dear.

471
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:25.222
Good-bye.

472
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.555
- Paolo.
- What is it?


473
01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:36.963
What is it, Olga?

474
01:05:45.244 --> 01:05:46.802
My dear.

475
01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:05.288
Careful.

476
01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:21.864
Flike, you naughty boy.

477
01:07:22.107 --> 01:07:24.302
You had us all so worried.

478
01:07:24.376 --> 01:07:26.674
You ran away, didn't you?

479
01:07:29.348 --> 01:07:31.248
Have a piece of cake.

480
01:07:39.257 --> 01:07:41.725
She wants to make
one big formal living room.


481
01:07:47.132 --> 01:07:51.000
Mr. Umberto, eat the cake.

482
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:58.200
What's the matter, Mr. Umberto?

483
01:08:00.212 --> 01:08:01.543
I'm tired.

484
01:08:04.116 --> 01:08:05.640
Of her?

485
01:08:08.653 --> 01:08:10.052
It's a little of everything.

486
01:08:15.894 --> 01:08:19.227
Wherever you go,
you'll be happier than you are here.


487
01:08:43.321 --> 01:08:44.948
That's the way it goes.

488
01:08:58.703 --> 01:08:59.692
Go on, eat.

489
01:12:39.324 --> 01:12:40.382
Where's he going?

490
01:12:43.962 --> 01:12:45.486
Leaving already, Mr. Umberto?

491
01:12:47.132 --> 01:12:48.394
Yes.

492
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.590
Where are you going?

493
01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:52.503
I found a place.

494
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:53.662
Nearby?

495
01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.470
Yes.

496
01:12:56.908 --> 01:12:59.433
Then we'll see each other
from time to time.


497
01:13:02.213 --> 01:13:05.307
Listen, you need to leave as well.

498
01:13:05.383 --> 01:13:07.408
There are lots of jobs in Rome.

499
01:13:08.119 --> 01:13:09.279
Don't stay here.

500
01:13:09.354 --> 01:13:14.018
She'll kick me out the minute
she finds out I'm pregnant.


501
01:13:14.759 --> 01:13:16.624
Can't you go back to your hometown?

502
01:13:17.529 --> 01:13:20.191
My father would beat me.

503
01:13:24.235 --> 01:13:27.102
Will we meet again, Mr. Umberto?

504
01:13:30.308 --> 01:13:34.142
I left a few things in the dresser.
You take them.


505
01:13:37.082 --> 01:13:37.844
Good-bye.

506
01:13:39.651 --> 01:13:41.050
Good-bye.

507
01:13:59.337 --> 01:14:03.330
Get rid of the one from Florence.

508
01:14:04.142 --> 01:14:05.973
Yes, Mr. Umberto.

509
01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:59.096
I'm sorry, but you can't
bring the dog on.


510
01:15:02.434 --> 01:15:05.096
- Before 8:00 you can.
- You telling me the rules?


511
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:08.003
If it's a hunting dog, you can.
Otherwise, you can't.


512
01:15:08.072 --> 01:15:10.563
I could say I'm going hunting.

513
01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:11.834
For what?

514
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.801
Couldn't I have a gun in my suitcase?

515
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:18.115
All right.
Where are you getting off?


516
01:15:18.183 --> 01:15:19.946
Via Leccosa.

517
01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:25.779
Go.

518
01:15:57.288 --> 01:16:01.782
- That whistle just keeps blowing.
- I'm so sleepy in the morning.


519
01:17:06.724 --> 01:17:08.351
He's little, but he's mischievous.

520
01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:13.691
- No, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
- If you say so.


521
01:17:13.765 --> 01:17:16.700
- How many dogs do you have?
- About 20. Why?


522
01:17:16.768 --> 01:17:18.531
Do you keep them here all day long?

523
01:17:20.405 --> 01:17:22.373
We have fresh air and space.

524
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.809
I'd like to board my dog here.
Can I see where they sleep?


525
01:17:26.878 --> 01:17:30.644
- They sleep in the house with us.
- Three of them sleep with me.


526
01:17:30.715 --> 01:17:33.513
A blind one, plus two others.

527
01:17:33.585 --> 01:17:36.748
They snuggle up against me all night.

528
01:17:39.657 --> 01:17:43.650
I'm going on a trip.
I'd like to leave him here.


529
01:17:43.728 --> 01:17:44.956
For how long?

530
01:17:47.398 --> 01:17:48.387
A while.

531
01:17:48.466 --> 01:17:51.264
Board is 100 lire a day.

532
01:17:51.336 --> 01:17:53.304
Bread is expensive.

533
01:17:53.371 --> 01:17:54.360
Right?

534
01:17:54.439 --> 01:17:56.134
There are other expenses:

535
01:17:56.207 --> 01:18:00.906
tripe, pasta, tomato sauce,
because we cook for them.


536
01:18:00.979 --> 01:18:03.709
And besides the food,

537
01:18:03.781 --> 01:18:06.181
there's the bleach
and everything else.


538
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:10.584
Tripe is expensive,
and so is bleach and sawdust.


539
01:18:10.655 --> 01:18:12.885
And we have to eat, too.

540
01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.194
I'd like to leave you 5,000 lire.

541
01:18:28.272 --> 01:18:30.740
Actually, almost 6,000.

542
01:18:35.546 --> 01:18:38.208
Plus this suitcase full of stuff.

543
01:18:51.362 --> 01:18:52.886
When are you coming back?

544
01:18:55.833 --> 01:18:58.427
I don't know. We'll see.

545
01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:01.068
See all this nice stuff?

546
01:19:11.015 --> 01:19:14.610
You know, some people leave
their dogs here and never come back.


547
01:19:14.686 --> 01:19:15.983
What do you do then?

548
01:19:16.054 --> 01:19:17.646
I run them off.
What do you expect?


549
01:19:17.722 --> 01:19:19.781
Do you ever walk them?

550
01:19:19.857 --> 01:19:22.826
There's a boy willing to do it,
but he wants to be paid.


551
01:19:23.294 --> 01:19:24.591
We keep them here.

552
01:19:24.662 --> 01:19:27.426
We train them,
and they get used to it.


553
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.993
No, they don't get used to it.

554
01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:39.942
No. I'm not leaving him here.

555
01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:47.909
Good-bye.

556
01:19:47.985 --> 01:19:50.681
More money and less talk.

557
01:19:50.755 --> 01:19:52.950
You wasted my time.

558
01:20:58.389 --> 01:21:01.017
Daniela!

559
01:21:26.417 --> 01:21:27.611
Mommy!

560
01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:29.848
Hi, honey.

561
01:21:35.793 --> 01:21:36.782
Good boy.

562
01:21:51.676 --> 01:21:54.474
- Hello, Daniela.
- Hello.


563
01:21:55.279 --> 01:22:00.774
Daniela, do you really love Flike?

564
01:22:00.852 --> 01:22:01.944
Really and truly?

565
01:22:03.821 --> 01:22:04.651
Yes.

566
01:22:04.722 --> 01:22:08.249
Then you can have him.

567
01:22:11.896 --> 01:22:14.057
Yes. And you can have
the leash, too.


568
01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:18.598
- Miss, this dog is mine.
- What do you mean, yours?


569
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:20.296
Yes, it's mine.

570
01:22:25.209 --> 01:22:28.337
I'd be very happy
if the little girl would take him.


571
01:22:28.412 --> 01:22:31.006
Who will clean up after him?
Dogs are dirty.


572
01:22:31.082 --> 01:22:33.380
Guess who'll end up
with the dirty work?


573
01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:35.749
- I'll clean up after him.
- Oh, sure.


574
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.120
No, her mother doesn't want a dog.
Come on. Let's go.


575
01:22:40.191 --> 01:22:42.659
He's never any trouble.

576
01:22:43.361 --> 01:22:45.192
He's as obedient as a child.

577
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:48.830
You'll see. She'll be happy.
- Sure, it's a bargain.


578
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:54.361
But I'm giving him to her for nothing.
A dog like him, for nothing.


579
01:22:54.438 --> 01:22:56.497
Right. And that's why
you're getting rid of him.


580
01:22:56.574 --> 01:22:59.372
Come on. Let's go, Daniela.

581
01:22:59.443 --> 01:23:03.004
Walk, you spoiled little brat.
Come on.


582
01:23:04.348 --> 01:23:06.111
Daniela, let's go.

583
01:26:27.017 --> 01:26:28.678
Flike, come here.

584
01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:37.492
Flike, come here.

585
01:27:31.782 --> 01:27:33.841
Flike, look at the pinecone.

586
01:27:34.285 --> 01:27:36.446
Come on. Here, boy.

587
01:27:37.721 --> 01:27:42.886
Come on. Stand up.

588
01:27:51.902 --> 01:27:53.199
Come on.

589
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.099
Come on. Run.

590
01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:01.072
Here it is.

591
01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:04.581
Come on, Flike. Up!

592
01:28:07.384 --> 01:28:10.182
Good boy, Flike.

593
01:28:14.358 --> 01:28:16.918
Run, Flike. Run!

594
01:28:28.606 --> 01:28:30.574
THE END
