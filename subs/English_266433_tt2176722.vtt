1
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.149
So, did they talk to you?

2
00:00:34.173 --> 00:00:36.890
What, in their own voice
you mean? No.


3
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.171
Well, they...they talk through me.

4
00:00:41.264 --> 00:00:43.264
They speak inside my mind

5
00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:45.779
We're on target.

6
00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:47.804
I can feel them.

7
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.829
Steady...

8
00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:54.508
Sorry about the build up.

9
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.611
I could feel them.
I could...I could hear them inside.


10
00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:03.924
Pretty much on me.

11
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.128
They had this...meeting.

12
00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:09.153
and then they left.

13
00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:13.157
Stay alert.

14
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.229
See if you can get it.

15
00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:18.055
And that was it?

16
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.697
No, that wasn't it.

17
00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:22.049
They left something behind.

18
00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:24.497
Something inside of me that's
been there ever since.


19
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.015
Approaching the house. Stay tight.

20
00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.590
When I'm awake, it hurts.

21
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.620
But when I'm...

22
00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:36.910
When I'm not, it
floods me with these


23
00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:39.113
nightmares.

24
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.330
Nightmares, no. Nightmares, it's
not nightmares.


25
00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.982
It...it's not a thing, it...
it's a feeling.


26
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.191
It...it's not pain, it's not...
it's not fear.


27
00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:53.752
It...it's something else. It's
something much, much worse.


28
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.510
Go, go. Move.

29
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:01.769
Go. You hit.

30
00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:05.472
Why don't you take
a few painkillers


31
00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:06.917
before bed, just
knock yourself out?


32
00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:08.998
I've tried everything.

33
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.773
Everything.

34
00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.304
Everything?

35
00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:18.163
And it just never works.

36
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.577
No fatigue. Stroke.

37
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.385
Got you.

38
00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.105
Please stay tight. Stay tight!

39
00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.761
Fuck! What the fuck!

40
00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.904
You should get some help.

41
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.912
Oh, I've...

42
00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:44.599
I've seen doctors.

43
00:02:44.857 --> 00:02:48.252
And they say I'm in
peak of physical health.


44
00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:51.169
All I need is a little more sleep.

45
00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.920
-What the hell did you do?
-Something was there.


46
00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:53.973
What are you doing?

47
00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:55.840
I saw it, sir. It was
right behind Stevenson.


48
00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:57.310
What the fuck?

49
00:02:57.334 --> 00:02:58.943
So, did you try it?

50
00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:00.968
No.

51
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.882
All I allow myself is a few

52
00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:08.554
hours of sleep every few days.

53
00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:14.588
Go ahead, move! Bring it in!

54
00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:15.766
Target's on you.

55
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.665
Take it! Take it!
Target's on you! Go, go, go!


56
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.946
Pull out! Pull out!

57
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.970
If a doctor tells you to sleep,

58
00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:24.553
maybe you should sleep.
-You don't understand.


59
00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:27.434
There is something inside of
me that...


60
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.585
a comfortable pillow

61
00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.325
will not fix!
-Will! I believe you, I do.


62
00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.636
I'm making this
film so that other


63
00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:36.868
people will believe you,too.

64
00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:38.969
I don't care if people
believe me or not.


65
00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:42.332
Yes, you do. We've been
discussing it for years.


66
00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:43.233
If you don't care what

67
00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:44.356
other people think,

68
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.632
then what do you want?

69
00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:49.246
I just want someone to
tell me how to make it stop!


70
00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:53.706
How to pull it out
of my head!


71
00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:56.859
I cannot...cannot close
my eyes


72
00:03:56.884 --> 00:03:58.564
for them to tear them out!

73
00:03:58.565 --> 00:03:59.937
Alright, men!

74
00:03:59.962 --> 00:04:01.962
Put a bullet through my head!

75
00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:07.486
I fear that...

76
00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:08.828
that...

77
00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.044
The...the...anticipation...

78
00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.812
of...of...this feeling...

79
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.836
eats away at my life.

80
00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:18.327
Hold your fire!

81
00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:20.877
I need that man alive,
do you hear me?


82
00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:23.766
Put your goddam gun away, rookie.

83
00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:25.523
Bullets through and through.

84
00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:30.539
But he's alive.

85
00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:33.718
Do you understand?

86
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:35.929
Tell me what it feels like.
Does it hurt?


87
00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:38.170
It hurts! OK?

88
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.194
It...it hurts.

89
00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:45.068
Do you know how
to follow orders, soldier?


90
00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:47.584
Do you know how
to follow orders?


91
00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.140
You almost killed one of
my men in my target.


92
00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.648
Copy that.

93
00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:56.828
Don't worry about it, soldier.

94
00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:06.843
This is how we follow orders, soldier.

95
00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:07.928
No!

96
00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:09.046
No!

97
00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:16.563
I've always found it strange

98
00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:17.927
that humans even bother
to


99
00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:19.952
try and imagine the end of the world.

100
00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:23.483
Staging areas,

101
00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:25.507
ships to flee on,

102
00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:28.277
lotteries for tickets
off the planet.


103
00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:31.332
We're all so stupid.

104
00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:35.891
The beginning of the end
as they say.


105
00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.087
But that's long
begun by now.


106
00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:41.705
Truth is when it hits,

107
00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.632
You will simply cease

108
00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:45.657
to do the stupid little things

109
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:47.202
that you do.

110
00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.227
Just like that.

111
00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:52.055
Ten month...

112
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.837
if it's the big one...

113
00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:56.908
like the sun storm of 1859,

114
00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.932
the carrying event

115
00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:00.086
as it's called,

116
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:03.821
Then there's no
such thing as tomorrow.


117
00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:08.536
She lifts up the sun
like a fiery wing.


118
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.794
It whips back and snaps.
She breaks loose.


119
00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:13.818
Cosmic inferno like a

120
00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:14.990
moveable hell

121
00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:17.995
sprays millions and millions of miles
as if it were nothing.


122
00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.526
A cough. A sneeze.

123
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.830
And then, it hits us.

124
00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:25.855
Yes indeed.

125
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:27.879
It's going to hit us.

126
00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:29.903
And when it hits us,

127
00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:32.552
When it comes crashing through

128
00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:34.576
our flimsy atmosphere,

129
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600
the good will collapse,

130
00:06:36.624 --> 00:06:39.795
the magnetic poles reverse,

131
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.936
And you know what that means?

132
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.967
The entire surface of the planet

133
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.148
heaves. Its molten heart bursts!

134
00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:52.752
And we all drown in
a lake of eternal fire!


135
00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:57.705
Then we go to Jesus!

136
00:07:01.432 --> 00:07:04.465
Maybe we could just get a
little lecture.


137
00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:07.848
That's all for now, folks.

138
00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:13.052
I have a scar. 
I'm telling you.

139
00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:16.623
Just show it off and
bang! There it was on the radar.


140
00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:20.111
I don't know, man.
I wouldn't get too excited.


141
00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:24.074
Seen him before.
Ha, ha, ha. As was our cliche.


142
00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.963
Opened his eyes. Almost
blew over our head.


143
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:29.265
Never seen him so
sure of himself.


144
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.491
Sir?

145
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.311
Are you okay?

146
00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.279
Can we get you something?

147
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.670
Who are you?

148
00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:51.147
We're the good guys.

149
00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.059
We're here to help.

150
00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:56.772
Whose blood is that on your shirt?

151
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.796
Mine.

152
00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:00.107
They shot me.

153
00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:02.132
They shot you because you ran.

154
00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.749
Bad things happen when you disobey.

155
00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:06.319
It's best if you
learn that now.


156
00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:08.623
Let me go.

157
00:08:08.647 --> 00:08:10.647
Sit still and let's talk.

158
00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:13.171
We lost a rookie tonight.

159
00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:14.879
He was a good kid.

160
00:08:14.903 --> 00:08:16.903
I don't know about you,

161
00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:18.501
but we want to end
the bloodshed.


162
00:08:18.526 --> 00:08:19.372
-And you can help us

163
00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:21.903
by giving us some answers.
-I don't know anything.


164
00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:23.332
Oh, come now,
that's not true.


165
00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:25.356
What about...

166
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.380
the planets in our solar system?

167
00:08:27.404 --> 00:08:29.583
I'm sure you know those.

168
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.856
-Mars...
-Saturn. Thank you, agent.


169
00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:35.504
I have a feeling he's aware. Now.

170
00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:39.864
I'm curious

171
00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:41.888
what he knows about
things from


172
00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.111
a little further away.

173
00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:46.353
Let me go!

174
00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:53.154
-Let me go!
-You need to calm down!


175
00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:55.975
Just...relax.

176
00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:01.923
I told you...

177
00:09:01.968 --> 00:09:03.968
to sit still, old man.

178
00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:06.812
And you don't listen very well, do you

179
00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.430
spider Nevi?

180
00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:35.262
Please have Heather
prep the prep helmet.


181
00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:40.512
Now! Please and thank you.

182
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.831
William Cassidy. I
must apologize.


183
00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:06.823
William Cassidy is our guest...

184
00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:08.565
He's part of our team.

185
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.010
You know, you look a little bit rough.

186
00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:16.775
I have to admit. But I

187
00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:18.809
I did not expect that you
would look quite so old.


188
00:10:23.004 --> 00:10:26.209
Might be time to update the
profile picture on your website.


189
00:10:31.857 --> 00:10:33.450
William, I would like
you and I


190
00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:35.497
to hit the reset button right now.

191
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.805
I want to like you and
I want you to like me.


192
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.572
I'm a firm believer in
straightforward conversation.


193
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.439
If you and I would have
a straightforward conversation


194
00:10:45.464 --> 00:10:47.192
between friends,

195
00:10:47.575 --> 00:10:48.704
then we'll have a

196
00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:50.216
wonderful outcome today.

197
00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:53.114
It's so easy.

198
00:10:53.138 --> 00:10:54.377
Don't you agree?

199
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.515
I will assume that you agree,

200
00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:01.726
and that you're not
being difficult right now


201
00:11:02.173 --> 00:11:06.485
So, let's start with
a very easy question.


202
00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:09.493
What happened last night?

203
00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:14.463
I'm going to ask you
a few questions on camera, OK?


204
00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:16.487
Is that all?

205
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:18.643
Yeah.

206
00:11:21.786 --> 00:11:23.298
OK? Yeah.

207
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.993
So sorry about the confusion
before, but


208
00:11:27.017 --> 00:11:28.836
Can I ask you

209
00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:31.781
if my name rings a bell
at all?


210
00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:35.922
Why? What is it again?

211
00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:37.607
Joe.

212
00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:39.145
Joe Sullivan?

213
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.170
I got an email
from you the other night.


214
00:11:43.898 --> 00:11:44.920
No.

215
00:11:51.381 --> 00:11:54.197
I never give out...
personal information online ever.


216
00:11:56.657 --> 00:11:57.799
OK.

217
00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:02.235
I'm here with...

218
00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:03.698
Bill Cassidy.

219
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.934
Let me just say that

220
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.913
I have been following
your story for years.


221
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.124
And I'm doing a documentary.

222
00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:14.632
Extra
-Terrestrial activity.

223
00:12:14.656 --> 00:12:17.479
Things...beyond our atmosphere.

224
00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.338
So, it's obviously
a pleasure to meet you.


225
00:12:24.365 --> 00:12:25.901
Yeah...Uh...

226
00:12:26.084 --> 00:12:28.516
So the first question is:
You were abducted by


227
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.092
aliens thirty-nine years ago?

228
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:35.693
I never said abducted.

229
00:12:38.302 --> 00:12:40.671
Something came to me.

230
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.992
OK, good, That's what I want.

231
00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:47.016
I want to hear what
happened in your own words.


232
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:49.907
My own words?

233
00:12:56.162 --> 00:12:57.642
I met

234
00:12:58.773 --> 00:13:00.854
an advanced

235
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:02.218
life

236
00:13:02.242 --> 00:13:06.506
form...from somewhere else.

237
00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:11.545
You met them. What
does that mean?


238
00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:14.303
They came here

239
00:13:15.897 --> 00:13:17.897
through the front door,
just like you.


240
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:20.859
And you just let them in?

241
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:22.476
No.

242
00:13:26.824 --> 00:13:28.367
I didn't have much choice.

243
00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:32.734
They threatened you?

244
00:13:33.818 --> 00:13:34.882
No.

245
00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:41.156
They control me.

246
00:13:47.614 --> 00:13:48.946
So, what did they look like?

247
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:15.577
Hit William hard.

248
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:16.933
Please.

249
00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:25.886
That's it, agent.

250
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.167
Thank you!

251
00:14:28.674 --> 00:14:30.322
I'm sorry, William.

252
00:14:30.983 --> 00:14:34.897
Sometimes you really have
to hit that reset button.


253
00:14:38.218 --> 00:14:39.975
Now that you are clear

254
00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:42.507
on what our expectations are,
you should accept them.


255
00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.186
On the one hand,
you could disclose the


256
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.210
events of the twelve
hours or so,


257
00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:49.234
And on the other hand,

258
00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:52.504
just not really hand at all, it's
more of a toolbox


259
00:14:53.262 --> 00:14:54.637
of devices

260
00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:59.926
that you really never
want to have to see.


261
00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:06.211
Tell me everything
you know, William.


262
00:15:10.027 --> 00:15:11.476
I know all of you people.

263
00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:15.234
Strange, William.

264
00:15:15.258 --> 00:15:17.883
Very, very strange
you with your


265
00:15:17.907 --> 00:15:19.383
history.

266
00:15:20.012 --> 00:15:22.578
You've been staring
at the sky


267
00:15:22.676 --> 00:15:24.602
for decades now.

268
00:15:25.118 --> 00:15:26.722
Posting your theories online?

269
00:15:26.747 --> 00:15:28.848
Unbelievable ideas,
some would say.


270
00:15:31.192 --> 00:15:34.643
We've had our eye on you
most of your life, now.


271
00:15:36.343 --> 00:15:39.656
Sorry. No autographs today.

272
00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:47.496
Last night, there was a
coronal mass injection.


273
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.390
You know about it. You were
a part of it. Historic.


274
00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:55.046
Bigger than the Carrington event.

275
00:15:55.853 --> 00:15:57.211
This is kidnapping.

276
00:15:57.586 --> 00:15:59.814
It knocked something
out of the sky. Didn't it, William?


277
00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:03.459
Do you want to know what I

278
00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:04.771
can't get my head around?

279
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:08.791
There are so many
people out there just like yourself,


280
00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:10.816
Colorful folks, just like you,

281
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:15.482
who have knowledge of
or had experience with visitors.


282
00:16:17.294 --> 00:16:19.937
Yours was what?
Thirty-nine years ago?


283
00:16:20.906 --> 00:16:24.434
How wonderfully vindicating
it must be for you...


284
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:28.004
to have one crash in
your backyard just last night!


285
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.294
Or is that just too
much coincidence


286
00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:32.637
for your weak little
story to pair?


287
00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.426
It's separate.

288
00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:42.432
You find it funny
they're hitting me.


289
00:16:46.612 --> 00:16:48.612
Squaring with the enemy.

290
00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:56.221
Over the years it's
gotten more drastic.


291
00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:59.829
Usually I just wake
up in bed screaming.


292
00:17:01.931 --> 00:17:03.931
Sometimes, I wake up
in other places.


293
00:17:05.536 --> 00:17:07.017
Yeah? Like where?

294
00:17:07.712 --> 00:17:11.875
In front of the computer, staring
at sites I've never heard of.


295
00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:14.195
Sometimes outside.

296
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.695
I've woken up walking
down the highway.


297
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.030
I've woken up floating on water.

298
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:25.747
No shorts...I...

299
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:30.876
I woke up two states over.

300
00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.594
Two weeks had passed.
I had no idea how I got there.


301
00:17:35.618 --> 00:17:37.618
It had been erased from my memory.

302
00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:42.954
Once, I woke up in a field

303
00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:45.626
fifteen miles from here.

304
00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:49.822
I was covered in blood.

305
00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:53.252
There was a horse

306
00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:56.338
on the ground in front of me.

307
00:17:57.106 --> 00:18:00.512
It...it...had...been cut

308
00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:02.754
down the center.

309
00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:04.981
Its insides

310
00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:07.083
removed and laid out

311
00:18:07.107 --> 00:18:09.107
and displayed in the grass

312
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:12.382
like an internal...road map.

313
00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:17.650
Why don't we talk
about something else for a second?


314
00:18:19.213 --> 00:18:20.540
Like...

315
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.790
tonight's mass ejection.

316
00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:27.126
Yeah, it should...should
be interesting.


317
00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:29.673
Yeah...

318
00:18:30.104 --> 00:18:31.425
Solar flares in.

319
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.455
traveled millions of miles here and burst
through our atmosphere tonight.


320
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.668
Yeah.

321
00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:39.056
There's nothing else here
that should be interesting on the ship.


322
00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:41.837
They say it's going to
interfere with the whole grid.


323
00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:43.376
World-wide blackout.

324
00:18:44.212 --> 00:18:45.595
Grounded all the flights.

325
00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:46.962
Systems...

326
00:18:47.384 --> 00:18:49.384
...might get knocked out
of the sky.


327
00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:52.275
All the transit's been shut down.

328
00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:54.924
I look forward to it.

329
00:18:57.338 --> 00:18:59.612
Nature has a way of
mixing things up.


330
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:05.145
Humans really are
not in control.


331
00:19:19.864 --> 00:19:21.864
We'd like you to hook
up the platform.


332
00:19:22.044 --> 00:19:24.757
Let's put a couple of
holes into William's head.


333
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:26.381
And see what we see.

334
00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:35.674
You want to know
more about it?


335
00:19:40.061 --> 00:19:41.134
No?

336
00:19:41.158 --> 00:19:42.351
Well, it's too bad.

337
00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:45.461
It's less destructive if
you know what to expect.


338
00:19:50.304 --> 00:19:52.172
Is that comfortable?
-Heather!


339
00:19:52.841 --> 00:19:54.196
Please don't do that.

340
00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:58.557
It's just...when our subjects
are more comfortable,


341
00:19:58.582 --> 00:20:00.170
we actually get better results.

342
00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:03.341
Just...stop talking.

343
00:20:03.366 --> 00:20:05.519
And finish.

344
00:20:05.543 --> 00:20:06.870
Yes, Doctor.

345
00:20:22.025 --> 00:20:23.717
Doctor, we got something.

346
00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:27.322
It's about time!

347
00:20:27.706 --> 00:20:29.454
What I got here?

348
00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.336
equals square circle.

349
00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:33.361
It appears we have an abandoned truck.

350
00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:35.276
The back of the truck is clear.

351
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:37.119
The truck is clear.
-Copy that.


352
00:20:37.901 --> 00:20:38.955
Some blood.

353
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:41.650
Something else.

354
00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:48.312
Protecting...

355
00:20:48.337 --> 00:20:50.337
You know what we're
looking at here, William?


356
00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:54.032
I've made this truck.

357
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.806
Hey, your insides seem valuable.

358
00:20:58.204 --> 00:21:00.824
Must be your pest
helmet, doc.


359
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:06.121
I'm seeing a bunch of blood.

360
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.556
Doctor?

361
00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:16.939
You're gonna want
to see this.


362
00:21:18.063 --> 00:21:19.259
OK, bring it in.

363
00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:20.602
Copy that.

364
00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:22.134
There's a substance here.

365
00:21:23.486 --> 00:21:24.869
What is it?

366
00:21:25.633 --> 00:21:26.869
Definitely foreign.

367
00:21:27.877 --> 00:21:29.002
Sir?

368
00:21:32.431 --> 00:21:33.565
It's not human.

369
00:21:39.853 --> 00:21:42.252
Care to tell me what
you know about this truck, Bill?


370
00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:45.885
No.

371
00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:49.611
So, you might feel a
little sting here.


372
00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:52.521
That's not really a sting.
Kind of...kind of like a


373
00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:55.810
hot blade slowly digging around
in your head.


374
00:21:55.834 --> 00:21:57.293
What is this thing?

375
00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:00.176
Oh! So now you're interested.

376
00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:06.496
It pulls your thoughts
out of your mind.


377
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.538
No, we don't really know
how it actually works,


378
00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:12.391
we usually get the results
we're looking for.


379
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.954
Unfortunately,there's some

380
00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.583
undesirable side effects
for the subjects.


381
00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:20.372
You know, it took a
hundred years before


382
00:22:20.397 --> 00:22:22.827
anybody could figure out
how to turn it on.


383
00:22:23.617 --> 00:22:24.976
Isn't that interesting?

384
00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:29.796
What happened last night, Bill?

385
00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:38.942
That's a funny one.

386
00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:43.767
Can I have some more, please?

387
00:22:48.766 --> 00:22:50.800
Did I tell you that we
have figured out


388
00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:52.782
how it pulls your mind out
of your head


389
00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:55.962
but we have no idea
how to put it back in?


390
00:22:57.316 --> 00:22:58.523
They're so...

391
00:22:58.548 --> 00:23:00.548
Give me some more juice.

392
00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:04.595
Keep at it, girl!
Turn it up!


393
00:23:45.696 --> 00:23:47.320
Turn it off!

394
00:23:51.444 --> 00:23:52.633
Check her!

395
00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:57.016
What the fuck
just happened here?


396
00:24:02.088 --> 00:24:03.813
Take that off.

397
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.219
You crazy?

398
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:24.282
Good?

399
00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:28.279
Please take that device
off of your friend's head.


400
00:24:28.674 --> 00:24:29.689
Now.

401
00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:05.036
I order you.

402
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.512
Get rid of her!

403
00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.816
Is that the camera, soldier?
Bring it in.


404
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.110
Put it on the monitor.

405
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.823
Thank you, soldier.

406
00:25:35.448 --> 00:25:36.709
Hey, everybody.

407
00:25:36.734 --> 00:25:38.488
Joe Sullivan here.

408
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:40.511
Sully_5433

409
00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:42.756
I just got the most
amazing email last night.


410
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.152
While I was sleeping,

411
00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:46.401
I got contacted by a god.

412
00:25:46.426 --> 00:25:48.217
OK? Hello Joe Sullivan.

413
00:25:48.242 --> 00:25:50.984
I would like you to come
meet me at the address below tomorrow.


414
00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:53.007
Spider Nevi. Spider Nevi...

415
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:55.031
He's the whale of astronomy.

416
00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:57.867
People have been trying to
find this guy for years.


417
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:59.392
But he doesn't want
to be found.


418
00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:01.416
He's off the radar, he's off
the grid,


419
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.149
not even the government
knows where he is.


420
00:26:04.164 --> 00:26:06.485
He contacted me.

421
00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:09.962
Maybe...maybe he wants
me to film him.


422
00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:11.207
Maybe he wants to talk about

423
00:26:11.232 --> 00:26:12.427
the mass ejections tonight.

424
00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:15.420
I mean, There are some crazy
shit going on in the atmosphere


425
00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:16.904
and he decides to contact me?

426
00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:18.981
I mean, this guy's been blogging

427
00:26:19.006 --> 00:26:20.771
about an alien
experience for years,


428
00:26:20.795 --> 00:26:22.635
the things that he's
writing about, the


429
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.421
concepts and the ideas,
they're just so...


430
00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:29.366
Anyway...I'm backed up.

431
00:26:29.391 --> 00:26:31.007
I'm going to need the help. Let's go.

432
00:26:52.084 --> 00:26:54.834
That's where we're going.
Right over that ridge.


433
00:26:54.858 --> 00:26:56.787
I've got zero idea if
this is anywhere close


434
00:26:56.812 --> 00:26:58.854
to real or a total scam.

435
00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:00.250
All we know is what
this guy looks


436
00:27:00.275 --> 00:27:01.745
like and that he
goes by Spider-man


437
00:27:01.769 --> 00:27:04.370
Fuck. That sounds made up.

438
00:27:05.737 --> 00:27:07.526
Not sure what to make of this.

439
00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:09.878
What the hell?

440
00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:13.769
Jesus...the tanks...?

441
00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:16.852
I wonder if we can get closer?

442
00:27:29.464 --> 00:27:30.937
Howdy.

443
00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:33.890
Hi sir.

444
00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:36.047
My name is Joe Sullivan.

445
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.071
Hi, Joe. Is that a camera?

446
00:27:39.477 --> 00:27:41.477
Uh? -Yeah.
Are you filming me right now?


447
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.238
-No sir.
-I don't believe you.


448
00:27:43.263 --> 00:27:44.686
You're a liar. Why
you got a camera


449
00:27:44.711 --> 00:27:45.973
sitting there pointing at me?

450
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:48.684
-I'm making a film. Uh...
-Oh, you're making a movie.


451
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:49.722
I am, sir.

452
00:27:49.747 --> 00:27:51.284
You think there are
some interesting


453
00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:52.684
people up here, aren't there?

454
00:27:54.576 --> 00:27:55.981
Go fuck yourself today.

455
00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:00.755
What about tomorrow?

456
00:28:02.686 --> 00:28:04.551
Hi. Hi there.

457
00:28:04.671 --> 00:28:06.576
My name is...Joe.

458
00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:09.944
Hey! I'm Joe Sullivan.

459
00:28:11.831 --> 00:28:12.866
How you doin'?

460
00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:16.366
Hello.

461
00:28:17.263 --> 00:28:18.710
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

462
00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.107
Filmmaker.

463
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.512
Astronomer.

464
00:28:21.537 --> 00:28:23.060
It's really stupid.

465
00:28:31.623 --> 00:28:33.623
Alright. Here we go.

466
00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:35.959
This is perfect.

467
00:28:39.988 --> 00:28:41.069
Hello?

468
00:28:42.004 --> 00:28:43.093
Hello!

469
00:28:45.358 --> 00:28:46.531
Anybody here?

470
00:28:51.023 --> 00:28:53.562
He's coming...Jesus!

471
00:28:56.244 --> 00:28:57.703
Oh.

472
00:28:58.189 --> 00:28:59.727
Hey. Ha.

473
00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:01.256
You...just...

474
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:02.501
snuck up on me there.

475
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.650
Hi, I'm...I'm Joe.

476
00:29:10.297 --> 00:29:11.564
It's...

477
00:29:14.021 --> 00:29:15.276
Uh...

478
00:29:17.343 --> 00:29:18.955
Joe Sullivan. You...

479
00:29:19.765 --> 00:29:21.259
You sent me an...

480
00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:22.812
...email last night?

481
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.680
Uh...you're Spider Nevy?

482
00:29:29.194 --> 00:29:30.313
Um...

483
00:29:30.337 --> 00:29:32.520
Listen, I...I just...

484
00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:34.515
want to talk to you
for a few minutes


485
00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.386
on camera if...if...

486
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:41.758
Uh, I'm not going to

487
00:29:41.783 --> 00:29:43.566
take up too much of
your time, I just...


488
00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:47.063
I assume you want
to tell your story.


489
00:29:47.088 --> 00:29:48.931
You know, I'm a filmmaker, I'm not

490
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:52.969
I'm not some weirdo.
I have read everything you've written...


491
00:29:53.551 --> 00:29:55.801
...I've watched everything you
have posted online...


492
00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:57.825
...And I believe your story
and I


493
00:29:57.849 --> 00:29:59.758
and I'm not here to debunk

494
00:29:59.782 --> 00:30:01.782
I'm not here to make fun
of you or


495
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:04.321
eh...you know.

496
00:30:06.532 --> 00:30:08.532
Um...I'm here to...

497
00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:11.779
listen...that's...that's all
I'm here to do.


498
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.172
I mean,hey...if this isn't
a good time, I can always


499
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:21.375
I can always come back or...

500
00:30:21.399 --> 00:30:23.096
you know, we can just...

501
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.120
you can give me one of
those beers and...


502
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:28.177
We don't even have
to talk on camera or


503
00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:30.052
anything like that. I can
just put it down and


504
00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:31.672
just talk.

505
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.463
Oh...

506
00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:46.996
No...no...no...

507
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.020
No...no...

508
00:31:31.835 --> 00:31:33.835
Aah!

509
00:31:43.171 --> 00:31:44.736
Fascinating.

510
00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:47.372
Completely.

511
00:31:47.397 --> 00:31:49.002
Fascinating.

512
00:31:51.173 --> 00:31:53.060
I have put that

513
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:55.085
on hundreds of people.

514
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.141
And there is never
anything left, any, nothing.


515
00:32:03.114 --> 00:32:04.516
But William...

516
00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:08.102
There's still plenty
of you in there isn't there?


517
00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:10.954
Something's different.

518
00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:15.429
It is? What? What's different?

519
00:32:15.624 --> 00:32:17.624
It's changed.

520
00:32:18.601 --> 00:32:20.601
It's stronger.

521
00:32:22.245 --> 00:32:23.625
More vicious.

522
00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:25.899
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:27.032 --> 00:32:29.484
I'm sorry. I don't
want to see you in pain.


524
00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:33.647
You and I, Bill,

525
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.139
we share a mission.

526
00:32:37.593 --> 00:32:39.593
I'm not going to have a mission.
-Yeah.


527
00:32:39.617 --> 00:32:41.522
Yes, you do.

528
00:32:41.547 --> 00:32:44.061
Oh, but you do have a mission.

529
00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:47.270
That same creature that contacted you

530
00:32:47.294 --> 00:32:49.552
contacted us. Do you know when, Bill?

531
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:54.169
One thousand three hundred
and sixty-five years ago.


532
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:59.303
And we have been trying
to return the call ever since.


533
00:33:00.718 --> 00:33:02.718
We can help each other.

534
00:33:03.294 --> 00:33:04.742
Then...

535
00:33:04.766 --> 00:33:07.666
we can help you
find the proof that you need.


536
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.150
I don't need anybody to find proof.

537
00:33:13.556 --> 00:33:15.813
I just want it to stop.

538
00:33:16.313 --> 00:33:18.704
I know, I know,

539
00:33:18.728 --> 00:33:21.668
I understand. We
can help you.


540
00:33:23.489 --> 00:33:25.489
Where is it, Bill?

541
00:33:27.443 --> 00:33:29.091
Is it with Joe Sullivan?

542
00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:31.959
It's not with anybody.

543
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.701
OK.

544
00:33:35.733 --> 00:33:38.357
Come on. Come
on, William.


545
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:41.455
I feel like I'm being
much more honest


546
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.758
with you than you are
with me right now.


547
00:33:43.782 --> 00:33:45.782
He'll hurt anybody.

548
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:48.258
Erase anybody.

549
00:34:05.199 --> 00:34:07.663
So, Bill, what are we
going to see out here tonight?


550
00:34:08.467 --> 00:34:10.202
Fluctuations in the sky.

551
00:34:10.593 --> 00:34:14.359
Colors are ripples as it
bursts through the sky's atmosphere.


552
00:34:14.914 --> 00:34:18.123
This energy is traveling

553
00:34:18.147 --> 00:34:22.100
and almost 500 million
miles to get to us, and when it hits,


554
00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:24.527
Ugh. Ugh..

555
00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:25.580
Bill?

556
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:26.681
Ugh.

557
00:34:26.706 --> 00:34:27.843
Bill, are you alright?

558
00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:29.867
Ugh,- there is something
out there. -Ugh,


559
00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:31.582
I think it...

560
00:34:32.707 --> 00:34:34.270
Oh, my God, Bill, look.

561
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.020
Oh! Look. Look at it, Bill.

562
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:42.400
Look. Seriously.
What's happening, Bill?


563
00:34:52.214 --> 00:34:53.699
What's happened?

564
00:34:54.003 --> 00:34:56.573
-They're here. I can feel them.
Who's here?


565
00:34:57.574 --> 00:34:59.908
Bill, who's here?

566
00:35:00.277 --> 00:35:02.589
They found me. And
they've come back.


567
00:35:02.614 --> 00:35:05.790
What are you saying?
-Look. Look. You see?


568
00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:08.596
Don't you see?
-Please, just tell me.


569
00:35:08.619 --> 00:35:10.764
Tell me what I'm
looking at here.


570
00:35:10.788 --> 00:35:14.100
Look...I told you.

571
00:35:14.124 --> 00:35:16.684
They didn't believe me.

572
00:35:22.586 --> 00:35:24.319
Platoon. It's coming.

573
00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:25.561
Look. Come on.

574
00:35:25.586 --> 00:35:29.409
Up there. It's...It's...
Follow, follow me, follow.


575
00:35:29.434 --> 00:35:31.434
Look.

576
00:35:42.084 --> 00:35:43.179
No.

577
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:47.632
No! Bill, don't.

578
00:35:47.632 --> 00:35:49.632
Bill.

579
00:35:49.657 --> 00:35:51.016
-Bill...
-Shh!


580
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:52.265
Bill, wait!

581
00:35:52.986 --> 00:35:54.064
Wait!

582
00:35:55.493 --> 00:35:56.672
Wait!

583
00:35:56.697 --> 00:35:59.878
Wait. Wait.
Bill, I don't know where I'm going.


584
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.738
Bill...

585
00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:04.411
Shit!

586
00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:05.530
Joe!

587
00:36:06.448 --> 00:36:07.676
Over here!

588
00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:40.200
Hang on, Bill.

589
00:36:43.647 --> 00:36:45.138
My God!

590
00:36:46.717 --> 00:36:47.951
Look at this!

591
00:37:10.608 --> 00:37:11.881
Oh...

592
00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:14.940
Look! Over here, too.

593
00:37:14.964 --> 00:37:16.133
My God!

594
00:37:19.564 --> 00:37:20.632
Oh...

595
00:38:04.863 --> 00:38:07.763
Oh, my God!

596
00:38:14.021 --> 00:38:16.114
Don't get too close, Bill.

597
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.005
Oh...

598
00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:36.986
Bill!

599
00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.212
Run.

600
00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:40.414
Run!

601
00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:42.656
Bill! Bill!

602
00:38:43.414 --> 00:38:44.680
Shit!

603
00:38:53.147 --> 00:38:55.006
Bill, I need you to tell me

604
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.410
what it is we are
looking at here.


605
00:38:58.949 --> 00:39:00.949
What do you think
you are looking at?


606
00:39:02.544 --> 00:39:06.036
William, I'm going to
ask you one more time.


607
00:39:08.435 --> 00:39:10.435
Tell me what it is
that you found there.


608
00:39:20.285 --> 00:39:22.409
Is this some sort of
game you're playing


609
00:39:22.434 --> 00:39:24.247
to get people to
believe your story?


610
00:39:26.052 --> 00:39:28.052
Spray paint, cardboard,

611
00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:30.192
camera tricks, and
post on-line for your


612
00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:32.146
conspiracy buddies.
is that what this is?


613
00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:35.841
Or are we looking at something
significant here?


614
00:39:35.842 --> 00:39:36.851
Yeah.

615
00:39:37.806 --> 00:39:39.466
It's significant.

616
00:39:40.863 --> 00:39:43.910
If you are fucking with me

617
00:39:43.934 --> 00:39:45.626
I will make sure you
leave this building


618
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:49.065
cut up into a thousand pieces,
burned and pissed on.


619
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.861
I haven't much option
here. Sounds like I'm losing.


620
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:17.612
All units...

621
00:40:17.637 --> 00:40:20.085
we have significant evidence
to indicate that


622
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:22.251
an unidentified flying object has

623
00:40:22.276 --> 00:40:26.747
split apart in our atmosphere and
crashed onto Cassidy's property.


624
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:31.787
A small pod has landed in the

625
00:40:31.812 --> 00:40:34.662
forest and the main
unit is in the pod.


626
00:40:36.354 --> 00:40:37.943
Find me this ship.

627
00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:46.271
We're going to fucking die
out here.


628
00:40:46.295 --> 00:40:49.035
Shut your mouth, soldier.

629
00:40:49.059 --> 00:40:51.731
Move quickly and quietly.

630
00:41:02.464 --> 00:41:04.464
Appears to be a...substance

631
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.056
similar to what we saw at the truck.
-OK, sample it for the lab.


632
00:41:09.783 --> 00:41:11.080
We got something.

633
00:41:13.767 --> 00:41:15.767
The impact is obvious.

634
00:41:17.612 --> 00:41:19.400
Seven touchdown.

635
00:41:20.377 --> 00:41:22.744
So that's it? That's the
second crash site.


636
00:41:22.768 --> 00:41:25.867
Find the pod.
-Surrounding area is burnt.


637
00:41:26.328 --> 00:41:27.891
There's nothing left.

638
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.915
There's no ship.

639
00:41:29.939 --> 00:41:31.552
No pod. Nothing.

640
00:41:33.646 --> 00:41:37.458
You see what we see? There's nothing
here. I repeat, nothing is here.


641
00:41:38.785 --> 00:41:40.208
We need to move on.

642
00:41:40.682 --> 00:41:42.510
No, that's...that's the right site.

643
00:41:42.535 --> 00:41:44.081
Doctor, there is no fucking ship.

644
00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:46.956
Something must have come and gone.
Open your god damned eyes.


645
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:48.991
Ah!

646
00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:51.698
Bill?

647
00:41:54.219 --> 00:41:55.596
Bill!

648
00:41:56.461 --> 00:41:57.797
Oh,Jesus!

649
00:41:57.798 --> 00:41:59.475
No yelling.

650
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.875
Oh, God. Sorry.

651
00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:06.289
Oh, let's see whats happening

652
00:42:08.725 --> 00:42:10.428
There's something out there.

653
00:42:10.453 --> 00:42:12.453
You're fucking...what?

654
00:42:12.477 --> 00:42:15.105
I see...I see it.

655
00:42:17.746 --> 00:42:19.191
What is it, Bill?

656
00:42:19.919 --> 00:42:21.215
Bill?

657
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.372
Bill, what is it?

658
00:42:25.748 --> 00:42:26.855
Look!

659
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.880
Shh...Bill!

660
00:42:28.904 --> 00:42:30.085
Wait!

661
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.381
Bill!

662
00:42:31.404 --> 00:42:32.419
Bill!

663
00:42:37.557 --> 00:42:38.692
It's erased.

664
00:42:59.674 --> 00:43:01.489
Bill...

665
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.310
No...No...

666
00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:07.920
What the fuck is that?

667
00:43:09.936 --> 00:43:11.936
I'm gonna shit my pants, man.

668
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.594
What the fuck was that?

669
00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:19.938
Did you see it?

670
00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.951
I don't know, Joe.

671
00:43:45.922 --> 00:43:47.922
Bill, Bill, wait!

672
00:43:47.947 --> 00:43:48.627
Wait, wait!

673
00:43:48.652 --> 00:43:50.692
-I knew you had a
goddamned camera.


674
00:43:56.147 --> 00:43:57.392
Bill?

675
00:44:03.122 --> 00:44:04.354
Ah!

676
00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.328
Ah!

677
00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:21.792
Bill!

678
00:44:24.978 --> 00:44:26.386
Bill!

679
00:44:34.782 --> 00:44:36.048
Bill!

680
00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:43.641
Move...fucking move. Shit!

681
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.540
Oh, fuck. Move!

682
00:45:07.565 --> 00:45:09.065
I don't want to die.

683
00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:11.556
Fuck! Oh, shit!

684
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.580
Oh...Ah...

685
00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:15.767
Where...where am
I going?


686
00:45:15.791 --> 00:45:17.296
Where am I going? Fuck.

687
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.320
What the...?

688
00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:21.344
Ow!

689
00:45:28.908 --> 00:45:30.908
Shit! The light!

690
00:45:35.932 --> 00:45:38.514
Oh, oh, fuck.
What is this?


691
00:45:38.538 --> 00:45:39.826
What the...what the fuck?

692
00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:43.148
Things are about to get

693
00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.288
very nasty right now.

694
00:45:56.357 --> 00:45:59.406
We don't really know
what they were originally designed for


695
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.586
All I know, is that they
cause immense pain.


696
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:07.938
And shut off your body's
coping mechanism.


697
00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:11.438
Your body's designed
to shut off.


698
00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:14.125
But with the D-83 shackles,

699
00:46:15.462 --> 00:46:17.462
It keeps the pain switch
turned on.


700
00:46:28.247 --> 00:46:29.656
It's your last chance.

701
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.771
Where is that ship?

702
00:46:40.794 --> 00:46:41.943
Turn it on!

703
00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:49.394
Yeah, you want to
tell me where the ship is now, Bill?


704
00:46:53.108 --> 00:46:54.588
You had enough now?

705
00:46:59.446 --> 00:47:00.473
Hey, you want more?

706
00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:06.465
Come on, Agent! Turn it
up! Give him more!


707
00:47:13.708 --> 00:47:20.738
Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh!
Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh


708
00:47:32.104 --> 00:47:34.613
You're gonna need more
power than that!


709
00:47:51.108 --> 00:47:52.244
Hey!

710
00:47:56.414 --> 00:47:57.468
Bill?

711
00:47:58.258 --> 00:47:59.492
Bill?

712
00:48:00.149 --> 00:48:01.274
Bill, come on.

713
00:48:01.299 --> 00:48:02.407
Is it out there?

714
00:48:02.431 --> 00:48:04.211
Oh, please don't be out there.

715
00:48:04.235 --> 00:48:05.623
Oh, fuck.

716
00:48:05.647 --> 00:48:07.357
Oh, shit.

717
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.740
Weird. Oh. Oh.

718
00:48:09.763 --> 00:48:11.763
I'll just...I'll just...

719
00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:16.061
OK, OK, OK. OK. Ok.

720
00:48:17.554 --> 00:48:18.937
That's just me.

721
00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:20.961
It's fine.

722
00:48:25.224 --> 00:48:26.836
Oh, fuck! Oh, God!

723
00:48:33.393 --> 00:48:35.398
Why are running?
You running away?


724
00:48:35.422 --> 00:48:37.042
Gotta get way back to the cam.

725
00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:40.698
Up the stairs.

726
00:48:40.722 --> 00:48:42.722
Shit! get the door!

727
00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:48.528
That's not enough!

728
00:48:49.542 --> 00:48:50.552
Oh, shit.

729
00:49:01.979 --> 00:49:03.662
Bill? Bill!

730
00:49:04.272 --> 00:49:05.686
Take the camera!

731
00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:12.679
-Look!
-The shelf!


732
00:49:20.852 --> 00:49:22.067
The noise.

733
00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:25.458
Bill, what's that on
the fucking roof?


734
00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:29.832
Bill, how did they get on
the roof?


735
00:49:30.532 --> 00:49:31.857
Oh, fuck!

736
00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:41.540
Son of a bitch!

737
00:49:59.642 --> 00:50:02.179
It's back. At the car site.

738
00:50:02.203 --> 00:50:04.203
Back up, back up!

739
00:50:04.227 --> 00:50:06.227
Ahhhhhh!

740
00:50:06.252 --> 00:50:08.252
Ah! Ah!

741
00:50:10.388 --> 00:50:11.464
You can do it.

742
00:50:11.488 --> 00:50:12.794
Stevens!

743
00:50:12.817 --> 00:50:14.659
Ok, what happened, soldier?
I lost my feed.


744
00:50:14.684 --> 00:50:16.842
Something grabbed Stevens
at the grid.


745
00:50:16.866 --> 00:50:18.866
Stevens!!!!

746
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.890
Anybody got eyes on him?

747
00:50:20.914 --> 00:50:23.590
Go ahead into his last location.

748
00:50:23.614 --> 00:50:25.059
Did he say what he saw?

749
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:28.568
Negative. All we heard was
too fucked up sound, then silence.


750
00:50:29.365 --> 00:50:32.404
It ain't human. It's got to
be extra-terrestrial.


751
00:50:32.428 --> 00:50:34.428
Stevens!!

752
00:50:34.452 --> 00:50:38.153
Stay close. keep your
eyes open.


753
00:50:38.177 --> 00:50:40.489
Stevens! Stevens.

754
00:50:40.513 --> 00:50:42.513
Stevens. Stevens!

755
00:50:52.377 --> 00:50:54.377
Got a bunch of them live.

756
00:50:56.427 --> 00:50:57.947
Stevens is gone.

757
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.127
Fuck!

758
00:51:01.841 --> 00:51:03.151
Tracks.

759
00:51:06.992 --> 00:51:08.992
That side...

760
00:51:12.393 --> 00:51:13.688
Both of you.

761
00:51:16.254 --> 00:51:19.007
Ok, keep following. I want
you to find something,


762
00:51:19.652 --> 00:51:20.708
Find some answers here.

763
00:51:37.297 --> 00:51:38.643
Nothing for a while.

764
00:51:39.676 --> 00:51:41.073
It's been about an hour.

765
00:51:41.987 --> 00:51:44.676
I was thinking...I think
he's gone.


766
00:51:48.824 --> 00:51:50.824
Nothing's moved out there.

767
00:51:50.848 --> 00:51:52.247
I don't know.

768
00:51:54.604 --> 00:51:56.161
What are we gonna do?

769
00:51:59.465 --> 00:52:01.494
I just want to be backing
off that truck and


770
00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:02.721
getting the fuck out of here.

771
00:52:02.746 --> 00:52:04.746
Yeah, well, just stay put.

772
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.316
I'll haunt after daylight.

773
00:52:09.665 --> 00:52:11.175
Huh..

774
00:52:12.794 --> 00:52:14.027
We got a gun.

775
00:52:16.356 --> 00:52:17.879
If we could see it,
we can shoot it.


776
00:52:28.983 --> 00:52:30.895
It's just you and
me in the end of the world.


777
00:52:34.123 --> 00:52:35.555
Uh...

778
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.856
Yeah.

779
00:52:39.262 --> 00:52:41.262
Let's get out of here.

780
00:52:44.446 --> 00:52:45.825
Ok.

781
00:52:56.656 --> 00:52:58.656
It's a fucking light!

782
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.336
Jesus freaking Christ.

783
00:53:23.918 --> 00:53:25.308
Clear.

784
00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:26.472
Yeah.

785
00:53:27.524 --> 00:53:29.524
Where is the truck keys?

786
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:31.549
What? Wait a minute, truck keys?

787
00:53:32.901 --> 00:53:34.901
What the hell does it look like?

788
00:53:34.925 --> 00:53:36.925
Ahh!

789
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:41.871
Jesus, fuckin bullshit!

790
00:53:41.872 --> 00:53:42.908
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

791
00:53:42.932 --> 00:53:44.506
Where's the gun?

792
00:53:44.531 --> 00:53:47.023
It...it...it  bounced out of my hand.
I don't know.


793
00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:48.232
Did you forget?

794
00:53:48.257 --> 00:53:50.257
Maybe...I don't know.

795
00:53:51.014 --> 00:53:53.014
What about the roof?

796
00:53:54.053 --> 00:53:56.053
Bill!
Here!


797
00:53:56.077 --> 00:53:58.077
Here, over here!

798
00:54:00.074 --> 00:54:02.201
Can that thing get through
that fucking bed?


799
00:54:03.256 --> 00:54:05.256
Ok! Move! hey!

800
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.076
One...two...three...

801
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.100
Fuck it!

802
00:54:11.814 --> 00:54:14.025
3...2...1! The door!

803
00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:19.325
We can't stay here.

804
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:21.349
Where else are we gonna go?

805
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:49.368
It's gone.

806
00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.070
Bill!

807
00:55:23.094 --> 00:55:24.307
I fucked my ankle.

808
00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:26.658
No, no, no,no...move...

809
00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:36.208
Got them...?
Not on one key


810
00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:37.890
What does it look like?

811
00:55:37.915 --> 00:55:39.915
I'm gonna get the gun.
No! No!


812
00:55:39.939 --> 00:55:41.939
Don't do that. 
Bill, don't, don't...

813
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.432
No, Bill. Don't leave me with
that thing .


814
00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:47.611
Bill, Bill! please!

815
00:55:47.635 --> 00:55:49.635
Please! Please!

816
00:55:50.228 --> 00:55:51.455
Fuck!

817
00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:52.467
Shit!

818
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:55.709
Bill, Bill.
-Shh!


819
00:55:55.733 --> 00:55:57.733
Bill!
-Shh!


820
00:56:03.924 --> 00:56:05.224
Where did it go?

821
00:56:05.248 --> 00:56:07.248
It was crawling right there.

822
00:56:07.271 --> 00:56:09.271
Ok, let's get out of here!

823
00:56:09.296 --> 00:56:12.098
Hold on...
-No. Let's go!


824
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:14.293
I think it's dead.
Dead?


825
00:56:14.318 --> 00:56:17.821
What? What?
It was bleeding very loud


826
00:56:17.845 --> 00:56:21.239
and it collapsed though there.

827
00:56:21.262 --> 00:56:24.043
It stopped.
Ok, great.


828
00:56:24.067 --> 00:56:25.890
That's fucking cool.

829
00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.915
Wait there.
No.


830
00:56:27.939 --> 00:56:30.288
No. No, fuck you.

831
00:56:31.507 --> 00:56:33.507
Uh! Ah!

832
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:09.299
We have confirmation of contact.

833
00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:11.323
Yes.

834
00:57:13.155 --> 00:57:14.674
A video recording, sir.

835
00:57:16.213 --> 00:57:18.213
I'm going to see it now.

836
00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:24.485
You have my full
understanding, sir.


837
00:57:27.142 --> 00:57:28.680
I will be waiting your arrival.

838
00:57:47.439 --> 00:57:49.439
Fuck, come on, Bill!

839
00:57:49.464 --> 00:57:50.992
Bill, Bill, where are you?

840
00:57:54.211 --> 00:57:56.211
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

841
00:57:57.993 --> 00:57:59.993
Oh...

842
00:58:00.017 --> 00:58:02.502
Ah! Ah!

843
00:58:02.527 --> 00:58:03.802
Bill!

844
00:58:04.316 --> 00:58:05.487
Bill!

845
00:58:05.511 --> 00:58:07.894
Oh! Bill, Bill!!

846
00:58:07.919 --> 00:58:10.425
You've got to see this!

847
00:58:10.464 --> 00:58:12.464
What? What?

848
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.489
Who's in your camera?

849
00:58:16.364 --> 00:58:18.364
What are you doing?

850
00:58:18.388 --> 00:58:19.574
Come here.

851
00:58:20.544 --> 00:58:21.910
My god!

852
00:58:32.965 --> 00:58:34.382
Hello?

853
00:58:35.715 --> 00:58:37.320
Who are you?

854
00:58:44.502 --> 00:58:45.879
I knew it was you!

855
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:50.437
I've been waiting.

856
00:58:53.027 --> 00:58:55.621
Please, I...I'm needing help.

857
00:58:59.025 --> 00:59:01.025
Destroy them. I'm...
I'm nothing.


858
00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:04.533
I'm nothing!

859
00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:07.711
Ahhhh!

860
00:59:07.735 --> 00:59:09.735
Ahhh! Ahhh!

861
00:59:10.689 --> 00:59:12.689
Enough with the screaming already.

862
00:59:15.517 --> 00:59:16.337
It doesn't matter now.

863
00:59:16.362 --> 00:59:18.524
I've contacted council.
They will be here


864
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:20.165
in a matter of hours.

865
00:59:21.923 --> 00:59:24.334
You'll be in their hands now
and let me tell you, Bill,


866
00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:26.638
their hands are a lot
rougher than mine.


867
00:59:29.209 --> 00:59:31.209
We're moving...we've got some sound...

868
00:59:35.602 --> 00:59:37.602
It's here.

869
00:59:38.454 --> 00:59:40.454
creature is here.

870
00:59:42.187 --> 00:59:44.539
No! Hold your fire!

871
00:59:44.563 --> 00:59:46.453
Hold your fire, god damn it!

872
00:59:46.477 --> 00:59:48.477
Fucking idiots!

873
00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:53.932
You fucking chicken
shit morons!


874
00:59:54.894 --> 00:59:57.268
Don't just stand there
staring! Go get them.


875
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:01.042
Toggle that.

876
01:00:01.582 --> 01:00:03.066
Fuck me.

877
01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:07.629
There's a man.

878
01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:11.559
He's pretty fucked up.

879
01:00:12.895 --> 01:00:15.390
He's gotten the same substance
as the crash site.


880
01:00:15.414 --> 01:00:18.602
Oh, my God, I don't
believe it. That's...


881
01:00:18.626 --> 01:00:20.211
That's Joe Sullivan.

882
01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:23.633
Repeat. Same substance from the truck.

883
01:00:23.657 --> 01:00:25.657
And at the crash sight.

884
01:00:25.681 --> 01:00:27.019
Is he alive?

885
01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:31.488
He'll survive.

886
01:00:32.238 --> 01:00:34.238
Bring him to me now.

887
01:00:34.915 --> 01:00:36.083
Copy.

888
01:00:41.694 --> 01:00:43.694
Did you hear that, William?

889
01:00:44.928 --> 01:00:46.928
We're going to have a guest.

890
01:01:53.326 --> 01:01:55.326
You sure it's dead?

891
01:01:55.568 --> 01:01:57.568
It's not breathing.

892
01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:29.993
Uh, Bill...

893
01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:32.771
We should...We should
call someone.


894
01:02:34.677 --> 01:02:36.677
You focus on what you're doing.

895
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.380
Listen...What is that?

896
01:02:48.918 --> 01:02:51.086
Whoa! Oh!

897
01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:53.607
Get the tape! Run!

898
01:02:56.702 --> 01:02:58.084
Bill.

899
01:02:58.905 --> 01:03:00.108
Hey Bill.

900
01:03:00.987 --> 01:03:02.366
Why don't we call the cops?

901
01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:04.390
No,we should...

902
01:03:04.415 --> 01:03:06.317
We call the cops
and they can come


903
01:03:06.342 --> 01:03:08.219
and then they can
call whenever and


904
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.557
We can call the
army and the national guard

905
01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:13.177
This isn't right. I need
we need  the new suppliers.


906
01:03:13.178 --> 01:03:14.511
Wow...

907
01:03:14.536 --> 01:03:16.536
Shit. I don't feel good.

908
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.247
I wanna go home.

909
01:03:18.272 --> 01:03:20.692
Yeah...I wanna go home.
Bill, there's something wrong.


910
01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:24.567
Can you focus for a goddamned second?

911
01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.676
Good.

912
01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.837
-I saw that.
-I'm sorry.


913
01:03:37.892 --> 01:03:39.892
Will you clean that
shit up?


914
01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:42.095
What?

915
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.860
What are you talking about?

916
01:03:45.884 --> 01:03:48.978
- Clean that shit up!
-I'm sorry, Bill.


917
01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:52.229
Bill. Bill!

918
01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:57.541
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe. Joe.
Shit!


919
01:03:58.049 --> 01:04:01.127
-Fuck...
-I'm sorry about that.


920
01:04:01.393 --> 01:04:04.472
Before...the police...the camera.

921
01:04:04.839 --> 01:04:06.979
Is all in here. Cassidy, Bill.

922
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.892
Shh...

923
01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:09.917
This is his.

924
01:04:09.941 --> 01:04:11.619
It's so important.

925
01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:14.017
You're going to get the camera.

926
01:04:14.353 --> 01:04:16.353
And then you are gonna operate it.

927
01:04:16.377 --> 01:04:18.377
And I want you to see this. Are
you ready?


928
01:04:18.401 --> 01:04:20.401
Come. Come closer.

929
01:04:20.425 --> 01:04:22.054
Over here. Come on.

930
01:04:22.718 --> 01:04:23.890
Look.

931
01:04:23.914 --> 01:04:25.240
Look at this. Look.

932
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:27.265
See?

933
01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:29.935
Isn't it lovable?
It's good.


934
01:04:31.178 --> 01:04:33.178
The same thing that's
inside of here


935
01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.202
is inside of me

936
01:04:35.773 --> 01:04:38.360
There's something bigger
controlling us both.


937
01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:46.607
And I've got you.

938
01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:50.803
What's that?

939
01:04:50.991 --> 01:04:52.640
What?

940
01:04:52.664 --> 01:04:54.664
What's that? What's going on?

941
01:04:56.065 --> 01:04:57.453
We gotta go!

942
01:05:05.149 --> 01:05:06.267
Look.

943
01:05:09.047 --> 01:05:11.047
I got a visual! There he is!

944
01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:13.339
Target's on me. Take them!
take them!


945
01:05:13.363 --> 01:05:15.150
Target's on you. Go! Go!

946
01:05:15.175 --> 01:05:17.175
Pull out! Pull out!

947
01:05:24.202 --> 01:05:25.691
in time, men.

948
01:05:27.652 --> 01:05:29.652
It's on you!

949
01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:45.754
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

950
01:05:45.778 --> 01:05:48.572
What you've just seen is 100

951
01:05:59.654 --> 01:06:02.174
That's not exactly how you
thought it would end, huh?


952
01:06:04.051 --> 01:06:05.690
Don't worry, William.

953
01:06:05.714 --> 01:06:08.410
That's not the end for you.

954
01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:12.075
It's just the start of a long life.

955
01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:14.099
Locked up in a cage...

956
01:06:14.123 --> 01:06:16.159
squealing like a dog

957
01:06:16.183 --> 01:06:18.667
while they stuff you like a pig.

958
01:06:21.097 --> 01:06:23.097
I'm not afraid of you.

959
01:06:49.949 --> 01:06:51.353
What do you want?

960
01:06:52.678 --> 01:06:53.876
You!

961
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.670
do...suffer!

962
01:06:58.322 --> 01:07:01.423
We will find you!

963
01:07:02.969 --> 01:07:04.447
No you won't.

964
01:07:04.471 --> 01:07:07.096
We are in a heavily
guarded facility here.


965
01:07:07.907 --> 01:07:11.907
You brought us!

966
01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:17.270
Listen to me, you
cocky fuck!


967
01:07:18.642 --> 01:07:21.970
We ripped apart your
granddaddy in the sixties


968
01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:25.635
We'll rip apart you
just the same!


969
01:07:26.301 --> 01:07:29.721
You will suffer

970
01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.745
most!

971
01:07:49.228 --> 01:07:53.767
You will suffer most!!!

972
01:08:05.227 --> 01:08:07.629
We're approaching the facility
with Joe Sullivan.


973
01:08:08.555 --> 01:08:11.207
He's not conscious.
I hope you're ready for this.


974
01:08:12.203 --> 01:08:13.543
Aboart!

975
01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:16.195
Aboart! Do not bring
Joe Sullivan here!


976
01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:18.742
Kill subject immediately.

977
01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:24.797
Do not bring him here!

978
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:30.021
Kill him!

979
01:08:56.085 --> 01:08:57.817
There's been a breach!

980
01:08:58.629 --> 01:09:00.629
Officer! Let him locked out!

981
01:09:53.247 --> 01:09:54.520
What happened?

982
01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.539
They're here.

983
01:10:26.697 --> 01:10:29.101
Please...let me go...

984
01:10:31.593 --> 01:10:32.976
Help me.

985
01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:35.961
What do I do? Tell me.

986
01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:39.823
Please, I don't want to die.

987
01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:44.448
They won't let you die.

988
01:10:48.304 --> 01:10:49.901
Please tell me something.

989
01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:51.436
Something that you know.

990
01:10:51.461 --> 01:10:52.593
Please.

991
01:10:54.062 --> 01:10:56.062
I know they're like me.

992
01:10:57.179 --> 01:11:01.018
They may be something more
than is humanly possible.


993
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.378
I can't imagine what
they'll do to you.


994
01:11:21.247 --> 01:11:23.247
I guess it's over.

995
01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:36.666
Please...

996
01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:39.104
Take it up.

997
01:12:40.553 --> 01:12:41.674
Make it stop.

998
01:12:46.349 --> 01:12:47.917
Make it end.

999
01:12:49.683 --> 01:12:51.033
I'm begging you.

1000
01:14:30.012 --> 01:14:31.357
Well...

1001
01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:35.199
Congratulations, internet.

1002
01:14:35.223 --> 01:14:36.496
You win.

1003
01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.738
You deep dulled Sully.

1004
01:14:40.707 --> 01:14:42.707
I drove for fourteen hours

1005
01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:45.043
To an address

1006
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.788
that did not have Spider Nevy

1007
01:14:50.374 --> 01:14:52.374
I didn't even see the abducter. So...

1008
01:14:53.499 --> 01:14:56.969
All in all, it
ends to an epic fail.

1009
01:14:59.219 --> 01:15:01.219
I promised you guys a white whale and...

1010
01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:05.466
I give you nothing. All I've got to
show for is this headache. So...


1011
01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.240
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

1012
01:15:15.404 --> 01:15:17.404
I'll get back after it tomorrow.

1013
01:17:37.348 --> 01:17:40.160
Hello everybody. My name
is Ashley Winnington-Ball


1014
01:17:40.185 --> 01:17:43.272
and today we're going to
look directly at the sun.


1015
01:17:43.296 --> 01:17:46.317
mass coronal ejection.

1016
01:17:46.341 --> 01:17:48.387
Sounds odd, huh?

1017
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:49.771
As a matter of fact it is.
