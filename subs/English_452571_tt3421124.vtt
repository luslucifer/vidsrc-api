00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.220
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.550
(upbeat pop music)

3
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.410
- All right.

4
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.010
If you could choose
anywhere in the world,


5
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.380
where would you go and why?

6
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.680
- That would be Greece.

7
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.450
But, just long enough to
fall in love and


8
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.190
then we would move back here.

9
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.260
- Dinner with one person,
dead or alive.


10
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.690
Who would it be?

11
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.130
- That's easy.

12
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.960
My dad.

13
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.540
- In your wildest dreams,

14
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.310
what does your life look
like in 20 years?


15
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.310
- In my wildest dreams,
I would live with my


16
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.310
handsome husband, Dimitri.

17
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.450
- Ooh la la!

18
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.620
- We'd have two,
possibly three kids,


19
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.760
and we'd live on a farm upstate.

20
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.590
- Farm?

21
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.790
You want to be a farmer?

22
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.460
- I want to just have a
lot of space for all the


23
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.100
little kids and the dogs
and chickens to run around.


24
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.570
- Okay, Abby.

25
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.400
(giggling)

26
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.270
- Honey, tell me!

27
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.140
- Stop!

28
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.170
- Just tell me!

29
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.410
- Stop and I'll tell you!

30
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
I didn't send you my itinerary
because I'm not coming.


31
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.780
- What?

32
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.090
- I'm sorry, it's just
really bad timing.


33
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.060
This has nothing to do with
him, so don't even think that.


34
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.830
It's just, it's my
decision and--


35
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.400
- You've got to be
fucking kidding me.


36
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.670
(train rattling)

37
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.810
- [Brad] This is Brad.

38
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.480
Ha ha!

39
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.750
I got you, sucker!

40
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.450
Now, I'm probably doing
something amazing


41
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.450
in an exotic location
and working on my tan.


42
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.390
Yes, it is okay to be jealous.

43
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.120
Either way, leave a
message with my secretary


44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.060
and I'll see what I
can do for you.


45
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.660
(voicemail beeping)

46
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.560
- 19 years!

47
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.300
You're willing to throw

48
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.100
out the window for him?

49
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.700
- That's not fair.

50
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.840
- People change, Abby, I get it.

51
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.740
But, the person you've
become is disgusting.


52
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.070
- Would you take a look
in a mirror, please?


53
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.270
- [Brad] Yeah? Yeah?

54
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.240
You like that, huh?

55
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.780
Tell me how big I am!

56
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.750
- You're huge!

57
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.910
You're massive!

58
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.780
(moaning ecstatically)

59
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.480
- [Brad] Yeah?

60
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.350
How much do you love my cock?

61
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.250
- So much, baby!

62
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.350
I want you to fuck me forever!

63
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.160
(grunting)

64
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.990
- Abby?

65
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.390
Thanks for the cupcake, baby.

66
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.630
That's so sweet.

67
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.000
Abby, you knew that I
needed this and--


68
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.100
- Are you kidding me?

69
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.930
- Yes?

70
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.340
(screaming)

71
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.810
- Wow.

72
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.640
- What the fuck?

73
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.780
- What's your problem?

74
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.880
(screaming)

75
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.740
- Oh, my god!

76
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.450
I'm so sorry!

77
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.110
- My eyes! My eyes!

78
00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.520
- No, I'm not.

79
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.480
I'm not sorry.

80
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.920
(screaming)

81
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.060
(static buzzing)

82
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.630
(sobbing)

83
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.040
- I don't know why I get
so anxious about flying.


84
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.800
This is a breeze.

85
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.170
I always forget how good the
scared-to-fly medicine is.


86
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.340
(giggling)

87
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.210
I think it might work
better after


88
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.480
you've had a drink or two.

89
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.320
Note to Self: Always have
a drink or two.


90
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.420
(giggling)

91
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.320
- [Man] You do that the
whole flight?


92
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.190
- No.

93
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.560
(giggling)

94
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.600
The medicine wore off and
we're still up in the air.


95
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.100
I had two more pills.

96
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.210
They must have fallen out.

97
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.150
I just find it really
hard to breathe.


98
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.380
I just don't know how
there's enough oxygen


99
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.220
in here for all of us.

100
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.590
I feel like it's a metal coffin.

101
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.190
(pounding)

102
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.830
(flushing)

103
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.530
I need another minute please?

104
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.200
(gasping)

105
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.550
(upbeat pop music)

106
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.130
I think I'm standing in
front of the royal family


107
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.100
over there in the back
and then, over here,


108
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.040
look, look, look!

109
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.910
Whoa!

110
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.770
It's the castle!

111
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.810
What?

112
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.480
I think that's where they live.

113
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.540
I'm not sure, though.

114
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.650
(upbeat pop music)

115
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.190
This is amazing!

116
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.090
(upbeat pop music)

117
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.870
This is the scariest thing
I think I've ever done!


118
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.040
(laughing)

119
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.720
So, Penny told me that
this place is crazy,


120
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.250
but this is wilder than I
ever would have imagined.


121
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.360
I couldn't understand what
the bartender was saying.


122
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.890
I think I ordered a large.

123
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.860
(giggling)

124
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.160
- [Man] Excuse me, darling.

125
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.060
You mind if me and my
mates join you?


126
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.360
- Oh, yeah, sure.

127
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.300
- [Ben] What do we have here?

128
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.510
Hey, wait, stop.

129
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.640
Take this, take this, take it.

130
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.480
- Oh, my god!

131
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.380
Oh, my god!

132
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.110
Wait!

133
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.920
Did you see that?

134
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.820
- [Jewel] Look behind you.

135
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.190
- Runaway backpack?

136
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.350
- How did you--

137
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120
Thank you so much!

138
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.300
- I always keep the camera
rolling just in case.


139
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.630
You cool with that?

140
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.900
- What's it for?

141
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.870
- [Ben] It's a documentary
about backpackers and


142
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.540
all the crazy shit they
run into in paradise.


143
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.710
- What do I have to do?

144
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.970
- Nothing, just be yourself.

145
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.640
- That's it?

146
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.740
- Nothing more.

147
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.310
(speaking foreign language)

148
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.410
- [Jewel] He's asking
you if you want a beer.


149
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.810
- Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.420
Just regular size only, please.

151
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.820
- Right.

152
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.020
- [Jewel] I know he can be
a bit intimidating at first,


153
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.460
but he's harmless,
most of the time.


154
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.660
- He really records everything?

155
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.690
- Yeah.

156
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.490
- Oh, my god.

157
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.700
You should see this
guy at the bar.


158
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.360
He's got this scar on
the back of his neck,


159
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.370
something about a barracuda
attack up at Gili T.


160
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.740
- [Jewel] I should probably
get us those beers.


161
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.050
(suspenseful music)

162
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.780
- [Abby] Okay, interesting.

163
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.110
No time to tell me where she is,

164
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.580
but Penny sends me a
picture of her feet.


165
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.510
- [Ben] Boo!

166
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.350
- Geez, you scared me.

167
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.350
- [Ben] You up for some
island hopping?


168
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:05.990
- What's this?

169
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.260
- Phi Phi Le.

170
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.660
One of the most beautiful
islands in the country.


171
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.630
You should come with us.

172
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.900
- I haven't talked to Penny yet.

173
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.400
- [Ben] This is what the
lifestyle's all about,


174
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.130
just picking up and going
at a moment's notice.


175
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.730
You said you hadn't decided
where to meet her yet, right?


176
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.700
This would be the perfect place.

177
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.070
- I don't know.

178
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.710
- Have you seen the movie,
The Beach?


179
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.110
- Yeah.

180
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.910
- Come with us and you'll be
standing on it in two days.


181
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.350
- [Ben] Bus leaves tomorrow.

182
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.390
- Do we have to swim there?

183
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.820
- Only if you miss the boat.

184
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.930
- Okay, yeah sure.

185
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.600
- And so it begins.

186
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.900
- [Ben] I think a
celebration is in order.


187
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.000
(upbeat pop music)

188
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.210
- I miss Brad.

189
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.490
I know it's dumb.

190
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.590
I know I'm being an idiot,

191
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.060
but he could really be
sweet sometimes.


192
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.870
This is pathetic.

193
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.570
I am going to go check my email.

194
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.510
(suspenseful music)

195
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.080
(camera clicking and whirring)

196
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.340
- [Penny] Please, stop.

197
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.910
(sobbing)

198
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.110
I'll do whatever you want.

199
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.950
Please.

200
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.090
(suspenseful music)

201
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.040
- So, we've been traveling
all day and all night and


202
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.910
now we're on a boat
to Phi Phi Le.


203
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.080
Ben gave me one of these
little pills for the trip.


204
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.680
I'm pretty sure it's Valium.

205
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.550
They both took one.

206
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.380
Look.

207
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.120
(lush orchestral music)

208
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.570
- Are you filming them?

209
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.610
- Kind of them, kind of us.

210
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.940
I want a bunch of
footage so I can make


211
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.410
a video diary when I get back.

212
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.280
Do you think they're still
arguing about the price?


213
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.850
- I did.

214
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.250
I'm not so sure anymore.

215
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.120
- Well, didn't the guy say
it was just 15 bucks a night?


216
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.390
- Ben's passion has a tendency
to bleed into everything.


217
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.430
- So, how long have you guys
been traveling together?


218
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.770
- On and off, for
about six months.


219
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.870
- How did you guys meet?

220
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.100
- Chang Mai.

221
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.410
Opium dens have a way of
bringing people together.


222
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.710
- The Frisbee king of Thailand!

223
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.490
Did you miss me, little lady?

224
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.490
(shrieking and giggling)

225
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.590
- He's that Australian guy
I was telling you about.


226
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.160
Him and his buddies were
talking about a place


227
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.160
where you can blow up
a cow with a bazooka.


228
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.730
- [Ben] He looks like one
of those guys.


229
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.640
- That's a real thing?

230
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.110
- [Ben] The more you pay,
the bigger the animal.


231
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.610
I wonder where he got the
money for a cow?


232
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.040
- I thought he was kidding.

233
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.310
- It's Southeast Asia.

234
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.480
For the right amount of money,

235
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.550
you can get away with just
about anything.


236
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.520
Who are you?

237
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.290
- What?

238
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.650
- [Ben] I'll be right back.

239
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
- Where are you going?

240
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.290
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

241
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.130
- Hi.

242
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.570
- Looks like the boys have
found themselves a new friend.


243
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.870
- I think she helped me
buy a bracelet in Bangkok.


244
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.370
- I wouldn't doubt it.

245
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.840
This country's a lot
smaller than it seems.


246
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.710
- Do they know how
obvious they are?


247
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.420
- What do you think?

248
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.450
- [Abby] Safe to say,
Penny is pissed off.


249
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.120
This time, she sends
me a coconut


250
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.420
wearing an electric blue wig.

251
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.190
No message, just another
ridiculous picture.


252
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.160
I wish she would just
get over it.


253
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.560
- [Penny] You're gonna
want to see this one day.


254
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.330
Tell me why.

255
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.070
- I am not in the mood, okay?

256
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.700
- [Penny] Why? Why!

257
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.270
- Why? Okay, yeah, why.

258
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.110
Why?

259
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.980
Because you and me
need to grow up.


260
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.210
Because you and me are
too old to be partying


261
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.780
through third-world countries,
okay?


262
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.620
We have to settle down--

263
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.820
- [Penny] That's bullshit.

264
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.750
That's exactly what we're
supposed to be doing


265
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.120
at the age of 23.

266
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.560
- Look, I have a really good
thing going here with Brad


267
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.290
and I just wish, I wish you
would be happy for me, okay?


268
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.860
- [Penny] I can't believe
you're doing this.


269
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.700
- Okay, Pen, I've
made my decision.


270
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.630
I'm not coming.

271
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.300
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.700
- [Penny] Fine, whatever.

273
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.670
(suspenseful music)

274
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.840
- How much longer are
you gonna hide the sheep?


275
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.840
- Meaning what?

276
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.110
- Meaning there's something
on your mind all day.


277
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.480
You wanna come out with it?

278
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.690
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.


279
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.850
- You've got heaps of
shit on your mind.


280
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.060
It's obvious.

281
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.990
- Well, it's personal, so ...

282
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.430
- Shouldn't be.

283
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.860
You're amongst fellow
backpackers now.


284
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.200
There's no point in
keeping it all bottled up.


285
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.700
- Nice try, Dale.

286
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.600
- It's too bad, love.

287
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.910
You came all the way to paradise
to get stuck in your head.


288
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.850
(lush exotic orchestral music)

289
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.510
He's got this little lady.

290
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.210
She's doing a damn near
perfect impression of a Dyson


291
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.780
on his willy, so he decides
to turn things up a bit.


292
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.350
That's when he discovers
the little lady is,


293
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.810
in fact, a little fella.

294
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.680
(laughing)

295
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.080
- I've heard this urban
legend before.


296
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.320
- Oh, bullshit, mate.

297
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.190
My mate doesn't get angry.

298
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.290
Instead, he takes the
lady-boy out to a bar,


299
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.890
gets him absolutely
plastered and then


300
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.430
takes him to a tattoo parlor.

301
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.660
200 Australian dollars later,

302
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.530
a very strategic piece
of artwork is in place.


303
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.200
Between the lady-boy's
shoulder blades,


304
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.030
in such a way that it's
very hard for him to see,


305
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.970
it now reads "I have
cock and balls."


306
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.340
- Oh, you're kidding.

307
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.410
- Not only am I not kidding,

308
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.980
two days later I saw him
walking down the beach,


309
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.550
still trying to
seduce the farang,


310
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.450
which leads me to believe
he doesn't know


311
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.020
what it says on his back.

312
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.520
- Where's your buddy now?

313
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.920
- Probably back at Patong Beach.

314
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.390
Turns out playing a
little Russian Roulette


315
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.790
with his pecker is one of
his favorite new games.


316
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.690
(ecstatic moaning)

317
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.570
Oh, you like that?

318
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.840
- Give it to me!

319
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.640
- Naughtiness, naughtiness!

320
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.270
You want it harder?

321
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.950
(moaning)

322
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.950
- Yeah, yeah!

323
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.420
Oh! Oh!

324
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.850
(groaning orgasmically)

325
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.450
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

326
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.290
- [Jewel] What are you doing?

327
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.290
- Hey! I wasn't--

328
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.630
We should go back to Ben.

329
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.460
Now.

330
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.370
Penny's arriving at
the docks today,


331
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400
so I have to find out
what time to meet her.


332
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.710
I can't wait to hear about
everything she's been up to.


333
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.710
Huh, she sent me a video.

334
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.950
(dramatic music)

335
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.000
(gasping)

336
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.310
- Hey, just start talking.

337
00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.750
Whatever you need to say
will come out.


338
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.550
- Something happened
this morning.


339
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.660
I went to the internet
cafe to check my email.


340
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.660
There's something I need
to show you guys.


341
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.030
- [Clown] If you go to the
police, I will kill her.


342
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:53.130
If you tell anybody you're
traveling with, I will kill her.


343
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.700
What I want from you
is very simple.


344
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.110
Keep having fun with
your new friends.


345
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.970
That's it.

346
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.010
Nothing more.

347
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.620
Please don't make me
prove that I'm serious.


348
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.560
- I'm so sorry I dragged
you both into this,


349
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.590
but I didn't know
what else to do.


350
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.860
- You know what this is, right?

351
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.330
- What?

352
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.130
- Penny's fine, Penny's fine.

353
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.070
Have you ever seen that movie,

354
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.870
The Game, with Michael Douglas?

355
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.400
Really?

356
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.610
Awesome movie.

357
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.540
Anyway, it's about this
guy who's priorities


358
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.610
were so whacked that his
brother hires these people


359
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.810
to do this game on him.

360
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.580
The game, it scares
him straight.


361
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.310
Makes him realize what's
most important in life.


362
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.520
Well, that's what this is.

363
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.320
This is the game in real time.

364
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.020
I mean, it's happening
all over southeast Asia.


365
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.290
It actually started
right here in Thailand.


366
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.720
You pay people some
money and then they help


367
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.590
your friend find
their happy again.


368
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.590
It's like, it's paradise
juxtaposed with terror.


369
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.430
It's a pretty good idea,
actually.


370
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.470
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.


371
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.700
- Of course you don't.

372
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.170
Here, this should paint a
clearer picture.


373
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.470
- Please, I'm begging you.

374
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.340
No, please!

375
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.040
You don't want to do this!

376
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.140
I'll do whatever you want!

377
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.310
Please, no, please stop!

378
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.720
(screaming)

379
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.450
- [Woman] Why would you do this?

380
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.490
- [Best Friend] You needed this.

381
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.520
You know you needed this.

382
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.220
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

383
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.160
(applause)

384
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.640
- See, I could show
you three more of these


385
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.640
from last week alone.

386
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.670
- I don't understand.

387
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.340
Why would Penny want to do
something like this to me?


388
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.980
- How were things back home?

389
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.910
- Fuck you!

390
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.950
Don't you dare turn
this around on me.


391
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.280
No, you know what?

392
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.050
I feel sorry for you.

393
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.820
- I guess things maybe
weren't perfect.


394
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.190
- Anything she might
be angry about?


395
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.160
- Maybe.

396
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.730
- [Ben] Like what?

397
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.830
- Like I didn't come with her.

398
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.940
I stayed home to be with Brad.

399
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.210
She's always telling me
that I take my life way too


400
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.240
seriously and that I'm not
as much fun as I used to be.


401
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.980
So, you're telling me that
that video is supposed to


402
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.080
help me take my life
less seriously?


403
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.520
- No, no, I'm saying that
that video is an attempt


404
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.950
at shocking you, yeah?

405
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.090
It's an attempt at getting
you out of your own way.


406
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.390
- I came all the way
to Thailand by myself.


407
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.660
Why wouldn't that be enough?

408
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.160
- It's your first time
to a third world country.


409
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.900
I mean, that's the pretty
perfect opportunity


410
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.930
for Penny to get her best
friend back, am I right?


411
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.330
Look, we've all heard the
horror stories.


412
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.440
We've seen the movies, how
scary and crazy Thailand can be.


413
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.670
Yeah, no doubt about it.

414
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.410
And now, your best friend
is supposedly kidnapped.


415
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.110
That's pretty scary, am I right?

416
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.720
- This is insane.

417
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.780
- You know what's insane?

418
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.950
A million hits, that's
what's insane.


419
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.790
- Are you sure?

420
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.660
- I've been criss-crossing
all over southeast Asia


421
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.960
for two years.

422
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.990
Believe me, if there was
something like this going on


423
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.700
in real life, I would
know about it.


424
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.560
- It makes sense.

425
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.070
- The way I see it, hey.

426
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.900
Chill out.

427
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.570
Chill out, enjoy the ride.

428
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.770
Play along.

429
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.440
Then, at the end, you'll
get to decide what you


430
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.480
want your life to turn out like.

431
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.050
- G'day, mates!

432
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.820
I love to see people's
faces when I say that.


433
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.090
What's going on in here?

434
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.990
- We're just hanging.

435
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.420
- Seems kind of tense
for just hanging.


436
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.220
Oh, shit.

437
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.060
I love those videos.

438
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.090
They're fucking hilarious.

439
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.430
I'd do it to one of my
mates if I had the money.


440
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.530
You still angry at me, love?

441
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560
- No.

442
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.630
Sorry about earlier.

443
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.770
- How's about you save
your apology?


444
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.870
Join me for a cold
tinnie instead.


445
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.570
We'll consider it dead
fleas on a koala's ass.


446
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.610
- Get out there and
have some fun.


447
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.810
Those were the instructions.

448
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.640
- You bet your ass those
were the instructions.


449
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.710
Let's get plastered and
make some bad decisions.


450
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.550
Why the hell else would we
be on this beautiful island?


451
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.650
Come on, y'all.

452
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.020
It's Dale Time!

453
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.790
(suspenseful music)

454
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.130
Last time I went to this bar,

455
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.840
this hot little sheila
splatter-painted my chest.


456
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.600
Needless to say, we brought
that party all the way


457
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.410
back to her bungalow,
if you know what I mean.


458
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.380
(suspenseful music)

459
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.110
(upbeat electronic dance music)

460
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:54.330
- I have this horrible
feeling in my stomach.


461
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.900
I can't shake it.

462
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.940
My mind has been
racing all night.


463
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.740
I feel like--

464
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.770
Excuse me?

465
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.240
Did you put this
underneath my door?


466
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.240
In that room?

467
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.810
There was--

468
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.350
Do you even understand me?

469
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.820
(sighing)

470
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.130
- Let everything just release
and fill up your lungs.


471
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.110
Exhaling completely,
inhaling deeply.


472
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.280
- [Abby] Hey, Ben, can I
talk to you for a second?


473
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.910
- I'm a bit busy.

474
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.210
- Please? Now?

475
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.020
- Karma's calling, Ben.

476
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.520
- Speaking of karma,
how's about I get


477
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.960
some of what Benjamin's got?

478
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.430
- This better be good.

479
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.130
- [Clown] You have to ask
yourself a very simple question.


480
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.200
Was telling the filmmaker and

481
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.240
his hippie sidekick a good idea?

482
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.910
I'm not sure.

483
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.370
But, you're sure as hell
gonna find out.


484
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.180
All three of you are now my
pawns and Penny is your queen.


485
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.920
If you refuse to play
along, your queen dies


486
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.080
and if you feel the need
to tell anybody else,


487
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.650
especially that
Australian douchebag,


488
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.320
not only will she die,

489
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.460
but I will cut her into
pieces and have them


490
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.430
delivered to her family.

491
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.130
Now, get packed.

492
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.270
You are all due on the

493
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.670
Once there, sit tight
and await my next orders.


494
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.170
And, if you should refuse ...

495
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.510
(power saw revving)

496
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.960
- How could they possibly
know that I told you guys?


497
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.060
- Not sure.

498
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.200
Doesn't really matter now,
does it?


499
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.870
Got something on your mind?

500
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.170
You know, if you do, you
might want to say it now.


501
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.640
- I'm down to help you out,

502
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.640
but not if you're gonna be
looking at me like that.


503
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.910
- You still think it's a game?

504
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.950
- How bad do you feel
for telling us?


505
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.020
- Of course, I feel bad.

506
00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.450
Okay, yeah, right, I get it.

507
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.790
That's what they want, but
this doesn't feel right.


508
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.460
How can we find out for sure?

509
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.690
- We can't.

510
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.590
If it were that easy, they
would have been out of business


511
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.790
a long time ago.

512
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.260
Plus, you shouldn't feel
bad about telling us.


513
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.930
No one's ever filmed it
from this side before.


514
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.400
- And what if it's real?

515
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.840
- [Ben] I wish.

516
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.540
- Trust me, Koh Phangan
is a magical place.


517
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.510
Nothing bad is going
to happen to us there.


518
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.540
- I'm not letting you go back
to those crazy sex hippies.


519
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.310
- They're yogis.

520
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.440
You know that.

521
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.250
Do you really want to use
this as another opportunity


522
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.580
to prove how
ignorant you can be?


523
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.050
- I'm not ignorant of shit.

524
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.380
I saw it with my own eyes.

525
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.750
- The visual and the spiritual
are on two completely


526
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.060
different planes of existence.

527
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.130
- Don't give me that bullshit.

528
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.100
- I'll go check on how
the boats are running.


529
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.080
- Jewel came here two
days after her best friend


530
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.010
died of cancer.

531
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.480
She was looking for answers.

532
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.550
Let's just say she
ended up finding them in


533
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.990
a very unique set of people.

534
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.590
You should go get packed.

535
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.930
(chuckling)

536
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.500
It's pretty funny.

537
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.400
These assholes
wouldn't know talent


538
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.440
if it were sucking on
their balls.


539
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.180
They would have got half
the money if I'd have been


540
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:41.350
approved for the grant
and now they get nothing.


541
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.220
(laughing)

542
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.890
You know, it's pretty
interesting considering


543
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.090
the whole Penny thing, right?

544
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.130
I'm talking to myself.

545
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.400
Fuck 'em.

546
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.880
I'm gonna get it done.

547
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.250
I'll just do it my own way.

548
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.350
- [Jewel] Everything all right?

549
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.190
- Yeah.

550
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.220
What's up?

551
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.860
- [Jewel] Time to head
for the boat.


552
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.130
- All right.

553
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.330
Let's do it.

554
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.170
(suspenseful music)

555
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.300
- Are you recording?

556
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.870
- [Ben] Whenever you're ready.

557
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.140
- Hello, Penny.

558
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.070
I hope you're enjoying
your vacation.


559
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.210
I wanted to make this
video for you so,


560
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.280
just to let you know
that I totally get


561
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.320
what you're trying to do.

562
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.690
You want me to see that
my life is really good and


563
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.820
that I need to quit
being such a head case.


564
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.220
I love you for
trying to help me,


565
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.060
but I just don't think
that this is the best way


566
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.590
to go about doing it.

567
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.430
I think it may be having the
reverse effect, actually,


568
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.270
so I, can we just let
this all be done now?


569
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.310
I'm ready to have some
fun with my best friend.


570
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.380
We came to Koh Phangan,
just like the guy in


571
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.750
the creepy clown
mask told us to,


572
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.550
so I'm guessing you're
somewhere nearby so


573
00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.220
come out, come out,
wherever you are.


574
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.460
I love you, Penny.

575
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.930
Can we please just let
this all be done with


576
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.700
and go have some fun?

577
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.010
- Done and done.

578
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.210
Video is sent.

579
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.310
We'll have a Penny to
play with in no time.


580
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.750
- I told you this island is
filled with positive energy.


581
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.610
- I'm down for a drink.

582
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:27.550
Who's in?

583
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.420
- I'm good.

584
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.320
- Me too.

585
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.880
- To each his own.

586
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.020
- Did he tell you?

587
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.220
- Tell me what?

588
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.230
- He was denied for a
film grant this morning.


589
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.860
- That doesn't sound good.

590
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.660
- It's not.

591
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.330
A couple more weeks and
he'll be out of money.


592
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.530
Word to the wise?

593
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.640
Stand back while he
comes to terms.


594
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.780
(suspenseful music)

595
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.450
(grunting)

596
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.430
(waves lapping gently)

597
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.740
(suspenseful music)

598
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.100
- Ignorance!

599
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.530
It's always been ignorance!

600
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.800
People never see what's
sitting right in front of them.


601
00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.040
(laughing)

602
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.780
I can't wait for the
day when everybody sees


603
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.680
how amazing my work is.

604
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.890
(laughing)

605
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.670
Best day of my fucking life.

606
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.310
(sighing)

607
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.890
Well, I'm gonna get more beer,
okay?


608
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.700
(suspenseful music)

609
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.620
(heavy breathing)

610
00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.990
I really thought things
would be different here.


611
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.950
They're not.

612
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.660
I'm just a failure.

613
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.030
Like I've always been.

614
00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.200
(laughing)

615
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.040
(sighing)

616
00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.550
See, this is what it looks
like when dreams die.


617
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.060
Smile baby

618
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.090
Smile this morning

619
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.760
Make the sweetest sigh

620
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.370
Calling out to my dreams

621
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.470
(camera clicking and whirring)

622
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.270
- I came to get Ben for
breakfast this morning


623
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.510
and this is what I found.

624
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.220
I really hope he was
filming himself last night.


625
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.190
(heavy metal music)

626
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.600
(thunder rumbling)

627
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.850
- I'm sorry, who gave
this to you?


628
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.750
(speaking foreign language)

629
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.970
(thunder crashing)

630
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.140
- Not exactly sure what
happened last night,


631
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:33.410
but I'm pretty sure death
feels better than this.


632
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.510
Fuck.

633
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.380
- [Jewel] Can I get you
some whiskey?


634
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.620
- You're hilarious.

635
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.790
- We got another letter.

636
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.060
- What's it say?

637
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.590
- It's the local guy at
the restaurant.


638
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.330
They want us to go on a hike.

639
00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.430
- And?

640
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.760
- And they left a map
for us to follow.


641
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.840
There's no mention of
the video that we made.


642
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.100
I think it's time that we
talk about our other options.


643
00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.200
- Meaning what?

644
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.070
- Meaning I think we
should go to the police,


645
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.540
or the US Consulate--

646
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.740
- [Ben] Look, you might as well
cut Penny's throat yourself.


647
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.110
- You said this was just a game.

648
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.550
- No, I said I thought
this was a game.


649
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.420
- Now you're
changing your words.


650
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:10.850
- You're focusing on
the wrong things.


651
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.390
If we want to protect
Penny, we just keep playing.


652
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.090
- Yeah and what if it is
really some psychopath behind


653
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.260
all of this and what if we
go on this little hike and


654
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.800
he decides this time to chop
us all up into little pieces?


655
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:26.430
- First of all, you have seen
way too many horror films.


656
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.270
Secondly, I know it's confusing
but they were very clear


657
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.840
about what they'd do if
we go to anybody for help.


658
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.210
Yeah, there's risk involved.

659
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.140
We all know that, but fuck it.

660
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.210
You know what?

661
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.510
Life's just a piece
of shit anyway.


662
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.780
You need our help.

663
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.950
Penny needs our help and
I'm willing to


664
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.320
stick it out til it's done.

665
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.790
- I'm with Ben.

666
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.620
I think we'll be fine
if we stick together.


667
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.760
(suspenseful music)

668
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.970
- We're heading through
Paradise Falls and


669
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.270
I haven't seen a single
person since we got here.


670
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.310
(suspenseful music)

671
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.260
Everybody needs me to keep
from panicking,


672
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.370
but I really feel like shit.

673
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.670
I'm really getting tired
of babysitting.


674
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.740
We're about at the end of
the map the guy gave us.


675
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.570
I think we're really deep
into the jungle here.


676
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:42.310
- What are you doing?

677
00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.310
- [Ben] What?

678
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.280
- Are you filming
for your movie?


679
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:44.910
- [Ben] No.

680
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.310
- Jesus, Ben, can we just
focus on this map and


681
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.820
finding Penny for like,
two seconds please?


682
00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.050
- [Ben] All right, calm down.

683
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.750
- Your stupid fucking
movie is really


684
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.060
starting to piss me off.

685
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.890
Let's go!

686
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.630
- [Ben] What the fuck?

687
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:10.800
(suspenseful music)

688
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.680
- "Come out, come out,
wherever you are.


689
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.710
"Funny video.

690
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.220
"I liked it very much.

691
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.120
"Thank you.

692
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.250
"Simple instructions
for tonight:


693
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.590
"Buckets, buckets and
more buckets!


694
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.560
"I can't handle all the tension.

695
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:36.000
"Use the fliers as your guide
and please, have some fun."


696
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.500
- [Abby] What are buckets?

697
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:38.460
- As in the drink.

698
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.340
"Free buckets from 8:00
to 8:10, 9:20 to 9:30--"


699
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.770
- [Abby] Why would they
want us to go out and drink?


700
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.240
I don't get it.

701
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.910
- Wasn't that what Penny was
always trying to get you to do?


702
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.040
Loosen up and have some fun?

703
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.850
- Does this honestly
feel like an attempt at


704
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.050
helping me find my happy place?

705
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.980
- [Ben] Yeah, I don't
think I can drink today.


706
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.350
I promised God I
wouldn't this morning.


707
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.390
- The necklace.

708
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.960
It's Penny's.

709
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.660
- [Ben] How do you know?

710
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.660
- I gave it to her
before she left.


711
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.830
There's blood on it.

712
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.560
- Okay, all right.

713
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.730
Everybody calm down.

714
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.030
There's no way to know
that it's real blood


715
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.600
and how do we even know
if it's Penny's?


716
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.470
(explosion)

717
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.570
(screaming)

718
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.640
(dramatic music)

719
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:19.810
- [Ben] It's just the doll!

720
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.770
- Well, grown men are
supposed to be able


721
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:21.440
to fuck those things!

722
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:22.680
How did it pop?

723
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.850
- I don't claim to be
an expert on sex dolls,


724
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.450
but if everybody could
just calm down--


725
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.680
- You keep telling me to stay
calm,
okay?


726
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:29.820
This whole thing is insane!

727
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.620
I'm allowed to be a
little bit on edge.


728
00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.720
And you know what?

729
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.220
It is really starting to
piss me off how


730
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.020
none of this seems
to affect you.


731
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.090
- What do you mean,
none of this affects me?


732
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.390
I'm just choosing to
keep it together.


733
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.470
- [Jewel] Abby?

734
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.470
- [Ben] I don't need
this shit today.


735
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.440
(suspenseful music)

736
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.470
Hello, ladies.

737
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.870
- What are you so happy about?

738
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.940
- Nothing.

739
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:56.940
- Where have you been?

740
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.840
We've been looking for you.

741
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:58.870
- I know.

742
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.810
I got some good footage of it.

743
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.710
- What?

744
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.410
- I needed some b-roll.

745
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.510
- Look, Ben, I am
getting really tired


746
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.510
of you filming everything.

747
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:09.950
- All right, enough.

748
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.220
Guys, we've had this
conversation already today,
okay?


749
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:13.490
- Exactly.

750
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.990
Who's ready for some buckets?

751
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.890
(dramatic music)

752
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:26.000
(camera clicking and whirring)

753
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.170
- Looky who I found.

754
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.340
- Oh, what have you
guys been up to?


755
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.030
(echoing laughter)

756
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.570
(suspenseful music)

757
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.350
(heavy breathing)

758
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.670
(dramatic music)

759
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:16.640
(camera clicking and whirring)

760
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.720
- Who are you looking for?

761
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:24.820
- Abby.

762
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:26.750
- I think she just went
to the bathroom.


763
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:27.790
- Yeah, she's fine.

764
00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.320
She'll be right back.

765
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.020
- Pretty casual attitude
considering everything


766
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.790
that's been going on,
don't you think?


767
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.690
- What do you mean, everything
that's been going on?


768
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.530
- Nothing.

769
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.830
- No, it's not nothing.

770
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.400
- Yeah, I get it.

771
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:40.800
You're upset.

772
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.970
- What are you guys
talking about?


773
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.140
- Forget it.

774
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.340
- So fucking dramatic.

775
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.010
- Abby?

776
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.040
Abigail?

777
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.010
Abby!

778
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.050
Abigail!

779
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.080
Ben!

780
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:57.950
- [Ben] Oh, shit.

781
00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.050
- Oh my god.

782
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.790
Do you see that?

783
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.320
Someone got her good.

784
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.560
(laughing)

785
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.460
- You need to go.

786
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.030
You need to go.

787
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.160
- [Tabitha] Relax!

788
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.660
I'm not trying to hurt
anyone's feelings.


789
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.160
(laughing)

790
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.270
- You know what?

791
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.270
I'm glad you're having
a good time but


792
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.430
you need to leave now!

793
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.270
- Fine.

794
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.840
Uptight.

795
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:18.670
Geez.

796
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.580
- I need help.

797
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.830
- [Clown] How was your night?

798
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.460
Funny thing about alcohol.

799
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.570
It dulls the senses,
makes it really easy


800
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.140
to sneak right by somebody
and slip a little something


801
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.670
in their drink if you want to.

802
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.110
Too bad about your dad.

803
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.880
Your mom looks like a nice lady,
though.


804
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.250
How is Ithaca this time of year?

805
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.650
I've always wanted to visit.

806
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.220
(screaming)

807
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.420
(static buzzing)

808
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.590
(knocking)

809
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.790
- Who is it?

810
00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.290
- [Ben] It's Ben.

811
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.310
- I think I was
drugged last night.


812
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.940
- Yeah, that makes three of us.

813
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.550
Something I need you to see.

814
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.230
- Somebody please help me.

815
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:27.930
(whimpering)

816
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:28.900
He won't let me go.

817
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.770
He said if I try to escape,
he's gonna kill my family.


818
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:35.880
(sobbing)

819
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:36.710
Please.

820
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.720
- The bathroom.

821
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.830
(suspenseful music)

822
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.380
Whoa, whoa.

823
00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:14.410
What are you doing?

824
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.650
What are you doing?

825
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.120
- [Abby] I'm taking these
to the police.


826
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.020
We need help.

827
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.050
- No, no, no, no.

828
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.090
We can't, we can't.

829
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.050
- [Abby] Bullshit.

830
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.920
It's over.

831
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.560
It's gone way too far.

832
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.290
- So, even if it means
Penny's life, you're done?


833
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:27.430
- What do you suggest we do?

834
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.260
- We keep fighting.

835
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.130
We get her back.

836
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.000
- No, no way.

837
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.930
Not like this.

838
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.130
- With a best friend like you--

839
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.340
- What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?


840
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.940
- I'm talking about Penny.

841
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.370
- You don't even know Penny!

842
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.810
- You know, which is odd,
because I'm the only one


843
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.640
who's looking out for her.

844
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.010
- You're not looking
out for Penny.


845
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.040
You're looking out for you
and yourself and your movie!


846
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.080
Jesus!

847
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.010
You don't give a shit
about Penny!


848
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.950
You were denied your grant
so you have to go home.


849
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.220
This is your last shot at
getting whatever the fuck


850
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.060
you think you need to
finish your film.


851
00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.760
I know all about it, so let's
just be clear about that.


852
00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:00.260
- Fuck you.

853
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.560
- Oh, fuck me?

854
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:03.730
It's not my fault that you
don't have what you need.


855
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.400
- Guys!

856
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:05.230
- That's such bullshit.

857
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.100
- Look!

858
00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:09.070
(suspenseful music)

859
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.350
- "Ready to go to
the police yet?


860
00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.720
"Sure would hate to
have to kill Penny when


861
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:27.020
"you're this close to
getting her back.


862
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.560
"And to think, all you would
have to do is keep a clear head


863
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.260
"and continue to play along.

864
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.590
"Tonight, Full Moon Party
Treasure Hunt.


865
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.100
"Step One, hippie chick

866
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:40.430
"at Mushroom Mountain, five p.m.
sharp.


867
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.470
"Be there or I cut Penny
into little squares."


868
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.840
(suspenseful music)

869
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.950
- I'll do whatever you
need me to do.


870
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.260
- Okay.

871
00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.530
Before this goes one
step further,


872
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.970
we are getting the fuck
out of this hotel.


873
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.940
(suspenseful music)

874
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.280
(knocking)

875
00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:01.150
Ben?

876
00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.780
- Yeah, one second.

877
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.120
- [Abby] Why is your
room locked?


878
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.990
- [Ben] Forget it.

879
00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:12.830
Let's go.

880
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.400
- [Ben] As good as always?

881
00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.540
- Hope you guys are good
without me for a while.


882
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.480
(speaking foreign language)

883
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:07.180
- Who gave that to you?

884
00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.010
Excuse me?

885
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.690
- "Say 'I love Penny'?"

886
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.130
(upbeat tropical music)

887
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.230
Hi.

888
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.570
I love Penny?

889
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.670
- To drink?

890
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.540
- Yeah, two beers please.

891
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:53.990
Who gave this to you?

892
00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.540
(suspenseful music)

893
00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.110
I don't understand how
doing any of this


894
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.450
could actually help someone.

895
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.380
- They break you down.

896
00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.090
The real you becomes very clear.

897
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.020
- Eight p.m. sharp.

898
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.530
What do you think would
happen if we went earlier?


899
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.560
- I'm down if you are.

900
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.910
Abby, we are not leaving
here without Penny.


901
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.740
Know that.

902
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.210
You were right, what
you said earlier.


903
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.650
I don't know her.

904
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.480
When it comes to my film,
it's not very casual


905
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.150
but this is not about
my film anymore.


906
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:55.250
This is about not
letting those fuckers


907
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.160
push us around anymore.

908
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.730
No more being on the
bottom of the pile.


909
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.140
Where'd Jewel go?

910
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:18.810
(upbeat electronic music)

911
00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:19.480
- Ha!

912
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.480
You guys have to try this!

913
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:22.980
It feels amazing!

914
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.090
(suspenseful music)

915
00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:34.890
(voices echoing)

916
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.720
(suspenseful music)

917
00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:48.900
(gasping)

918
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.240
(dramatic music)

919
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.020
(retching)

920
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:12.660
- [Abby] Oh, my god.

921
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:13.490
Penny's gonna die.

922
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:14.330
What is this shit?

923
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.430
- [Ben] No, no, no.

924
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.660
We have to keep it together,
all right?


925
00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:17.830
- [Abby] Oh, god, how?

926
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.600
Tabitha's dead.

927
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:19.700
We're all gonna die!

928
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:20.630
- [Ben] We're not gonna die,
all right.


929
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.030
Just let me think for a minute.

930
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.040
- [Abby] What the fuck
does it matter?


931
00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:24.970
- [Ben] This can't be real.

932
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.600
- [Abby] She's already dead.

933
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.710
I know it.

934
00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.810
- [Ben] You don't know that,
all right?


935
00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.510
- We don't know anything.

936
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.640
That is the point.

937
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.440
- [Ben] Okay, the last
time we saw Penny,


938
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.480
she was alive, all right?

939
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:33.510
We still have to
believe that's true.


940
00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:35.010
- [Abby] I can't do
this anymore!


941
00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.920
(sobbing)

942
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:36.980
- [Ben] It's the only
choice we've got.


943
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.050
Do you really want to
be the reason


944
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.620
that your best friend
gets killed?


945
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.620
- [Abby] That is not fair.

946
00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:41.520
(sobbing)

947
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:43.520
I didn't ask for any of this.

948
00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.760
I'm not the strong one.

949
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:46.630
She is.

950
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.890
(sobbing)

951
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:50.900
- [Ben] Breathe, breathe,
breathe.


952
00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.370
(suspenseful music)

953
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.940
I fuckin' knew it.

954
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.310
It's a fucking security camera.

955
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.280
(suspenseful music)

956
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:42.310
(upbeat electronic dance music)

957
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.490
(screaming)

958
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.460
(upbeat electronic dance music)

959
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.910
(screaming)

960
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:10.740
- What's wrong?

961
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:11.940
- Where's Jewel?

962
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.770
- She said she wanted
to get some fresh air.


963
01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:15.410
- [Ben] Where'd she go?

964
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.710
- I don't know.

965
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.210
Out to the beach, I guess.

966
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:18.880
Why?

967
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.850
What's going on?

968
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.280
- This was taped to our
front door this morning.


969
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320
- What is it?

970
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:25.480
- I'm not sure.

971
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:29.960
It will be hard to watch.

972
01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.160
- Hi, Abby!

973
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.430
It's me.

974
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.400
I'm outside.

975
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:43.170
I just wanted you to know that

976
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.140
everything's much better
today, so thank you.


977
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.610
Thank you for playing along.

978
01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:57.850
I even got to take a
shower today.


979
01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.280
I almost forgot.

980
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.360
Happy Birthday

981
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.860
Happy Birthday

982
01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:08.560
Whoop
-Dee
-Doo

983
01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.330
Whoop
-Dee
-Doo

984
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:15.170
I've got a present

985
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.970
I've got a present

986
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.570
Just for you

987
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.210
Just for you

988
01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.780
(static buzzing)

989
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.710
- [Ben] Is today your birthday?

990
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:30.050
- [Abby] Mm-hm.

991
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.060
- There were other things
in the envelope.


992
01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.560
Things I couldn't show Abby.

993
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:46.230
Things that would push
her over the edge.


994
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.400
"Tell Jewel to watch her
fucking mouth."


995
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.310
Now, she's nowhere to be found.

996
01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.680
The real question is
when to stop.


997
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.350
How far is too far when you
have a legitimate chance


998
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:09.220
for the first time in your life?

999
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.490
This ...

1000
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.130
(sighing)

1001
01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.430
This is where it all ends.

1002
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.110
I can't show this to Abby.

1003
01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.940
She'd go running for help.

1004
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:30.780
I can't.

1005
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.550
I'm too fucking close.

1006
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.790
I think this is Penny's.

1007
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:49.630
- I don't understand why
you won't tell me


1008
01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.060
what we're doing here.

1009
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.700
- [Ben] Because there's a lot
of answers to that question


1010
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.470
that you don't want to hear.

1011
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.470
- I don't need you
to play Daddy.


1012
01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.700
(yogis chanting)

1013
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.480
(Jewel moaning ecstatically)

1014
01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.780
- [Ben] God fucking damn it!

1015
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.120
- This was where my spirit
told me I needed to be.


1016
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.820
- Who have you been talking to?

1017
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:14.950
- No one.

1018
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.820
- Well, whoever's
playing this game with us


1019
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:16.760
thinks you have been.

1020
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:17.960
- What?

1021
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.020
- We got another video,
one with a note and


1022
01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.090
some very specific
instructions for you to keep


1023
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.090
your fucking mouth shut.

1024
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.430
- I didn't know
there was a note.


1025
01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.000
- Trust me, there's some
things you don't want to know.


1026
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.060
- That's not your
decision to make.


1027
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:26.930
- What was on the video?

1028
01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.100
- Well, it was Penny.

1029
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:29.170
She was outside.

1030
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.200
She was wearing a nice
summer dress.


1031
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.470
Some very happy shit.

1032
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.810
- What else are you
keeping from me?


1033
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.410
- Who have you been talking to?

1034
01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.640
- No one.

1035
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:36.580
- [Ben] Then why does
he think you have been?


1036
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:37.740
- I don't know.

1037
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.150
Maybe they saw me talking to
Dale on the beach this morning.


1038
01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.080
- Did you fuck him, too?

1039
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.680
- I was meditating.

1040
01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.450
He stumbled up to me.

1041
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:47.920
He was still up from last night.

1042
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:49.720
We talked, but I didn't
say anything.


1043
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.590
- You positive?

1044
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.820
- Yes.

1045
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.490
I wanted to, though.

1046
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:54.330
- [Ben] Why?

1047
01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.090
How could that possibly help?

1048
01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:57.160
- Let's face it, Ben.

1049
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.530
Things have gotten
rather serious


1050
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.470
and if they continue to
get any worse,


1051
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.140
I wouldn't mind having
someone like Dale around.


1052
01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:05.470
(chuckling)

1053
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.710
- I think telling Dale
would be a very bad idea.


1054
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.370
- No, if we're telling anyone,
it's gonna be the police.


1055
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.910
- That's an even worse idea.

1056
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.280
Telling the Thai police
department you're caught up


1057
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.410
in a kidnapping and a murder?

1058
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.480
That usually doesn't go
over very well.


1059
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:15.280
- We didn't do anything wrong.

1060
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:16.480
- You think that matters?

1061
01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.420
The Thai police department
is one of the most


1062
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.080
corrupt police
departments in the world.


1063
01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.490
Do you think they care
who did what?


1064
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.490
- Well, then, maybe telling
Dale isn't such a bad idea.


1065
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.690
- Have you been listening
to anything I'm saying?


1066
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.830
- Then what do you
suggest we do, Ben?


1067
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.200
- I don't know.

1068
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.900
(telephone ringing)

1069
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:36.770
When did you get a phone?

1070
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.670
- I didn't.

1071
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:41.510
- Let me see it.

1072
01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.310
Hello?

1073
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.810
- [Clown] So happy to see
you all together again.


1074
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.750
Two p.m. today, you three
and Jewel's best friend,


1075
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.980
the Australian, are going
to Namtok Beach.


1076
01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.420
- I never said anything to Dale.

1077
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:54.820
He doesn't need to be a
part of this.


1078
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:55.250
- [Clown] Dale.

1079
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.560
Good to know.

1080
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.860
He's not part of our game
because he knows anything.


1081
01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.760
He's part of our game because
he looks like a lot of fun.


1082
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:03.400
- Will Penny be there?

1083
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.930
- [Penny] Abby, it's me.

1084
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.030
Please, keep doing whatever
it is you've been doing.


1085
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.130
Things have been getting better.

1086
01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:11.500
- Penny? Penny?

1087
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.590
- [Abby] Are you filming them?

1088
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.590
I asked you a question.

1089
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.630
- [Ben] Yeah, I am and you
might as well save your breath


1090
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.990
because as long as I want
to film things,


1091
01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.760
that's exactly what
I'm gonna do.


1092
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:42.400
What the fuck are you doing?

1093
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:45.570
(suspenseful music)

1094
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.750
(screaming)

1095
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.620
- [Ben] What?

1096
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:34.520
What is it?

1097
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:37.190
- It's nothing.

1098
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.420
I thought I saw something.

1099
01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.960
- [Dale] Everything all right,
love?


1100
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.790
- Mm-hm.

1101
01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:42.690
Let's keep going.

1102
01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:44.300
- [Dale] This is a nice
little camera you've got here.


1103
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:47.270
The dynamic range on this
little fella's amazing.


1104
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.400
- What now?

1105
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:49.400
- Maybe I should film you ladies

1106
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:50.540
getting sexy with the camera.

1107
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.600
- There's no one else here.

1108
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.040
- [Dale] How a little
bit of that ethnic love


1109
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:55.740
for Dale's sexy-cam?

1110
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:01.950
- [Ben] Hold up!

1111
01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.810
Holy shit!

1112
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.320
Y'all see this?

1113
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.490
Anybody else see what I see?

1114
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.720
- [Dale] There must be
some other hikers around.


1115
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.420
- [Abby] Those are
Penny's clothes.


1116
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.290
- [Dale] Penny?

1117
01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.620
Another lovely lady?

1118
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.790
Never have too many of
those around.


1119
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.560
I may not be an expert,

1120
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.870
but I'd say that looks
like blood to me.


1121
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.670
- [Ben] Yeah, we know.

1122
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.540
- What do you mean, you know?

1123
01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:27.470
You expected some weird
shit like this?


1124
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:28.740
- He deserves to know.

1125
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:29.640
- [Dale] I don't like the
sound of that.


1126
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.110
- If we tell him, she dies.

1127
01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.980
- [Dale] I really don't
like the sound of that.


1128
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.510
- [Jewel] He's involved now.

1129
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:35.810
- Actually, you know what?

1130
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:39.080
Maybe I am best left in
the dark on this one.


1131
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:39.950
(dart popping)

1132
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.920
- [Dale] Ow!

1133
01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.460
- [Abby] What is it?

1134
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:44.990
- It's a fucking tranq dart!

1135
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:45.990
(dart popping)

1136
01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.260
(Jewels screams)

1137
01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:48.230
- [Abby] They're coming
from the jungle!


1138
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.390
(darts popping)

1139
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.900
- [Ben] Ow! Fuck!

1140
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:57.640
(suspenseful music)

1141
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.160
(crickets chirping)

1142
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.100
(waves lapping gently)

1143
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.630
(groaning)

1144
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.550
(birds screeching)

1145
01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.790
- I don't know if I'm
gonna make it out of here.


1146
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.300
(whimpering)

1147
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.600
It's so dark and I keep
losing the trail


1148
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:36.100
and my battery's almost dead.

1149
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.700
(sniffling)

1150
01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.540
If you find this and I'm gone,

1151
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.780
(sobbing)

1152
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:58.620
please tell Penny Sanderson's
parents of Troy, New York


1153
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.930
that I did everything
I could to save her and


1154
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.870
please tell my mom,

1155
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.610
(sobbing)

1156
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.010
Jane Ferris of Albany, New York,

1157
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.560
that I'm so sorry that
this happened.


1158
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:34.790
(sniffling)

1159
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:38.900
That I really wanted to
make her proud someday,


1160
01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.300
that I love her.

1161
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:44.600
(sobbing)

1162
01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.240
(dramatic music)

1163
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.350
Why are you doing this?

1164
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.250
(birds twittering)

1165
01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.820
(church bells chiming)

1166
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.720
- [Clown] You run, she dies.

1167
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.190
They all die.

1168
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:44.360
(whimpering)

1169
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.300
(static crackling)

1170
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:51.200
- Dale?

1171
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.600
- What the fuck is going on?

1172
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.140
I just woke up in a god
damned pile of garbage


1173
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.340
with the key to this room
taped to my fucking chest.


1174
01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:58.440
- I don't know what happened.

1175
01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.680
- Are you three playing
games with me?


1176
01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:00.850
Is this part of Benjamin's
movie or something?


1177
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.550
- No.

1178
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.410
- Where the fuck is everybody?

1179
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:03.110
- Please calm down.

1180
01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:03.950
I can explain.

1181
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.190
- [Dale] I want some
fucking answers!


1182
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.360
So, you're telling me,
I'm either on one of those


1183
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.100
internet videos where a
psychopath has abducted
everybody?


1184
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.970
- No, I'm telling you
that we all thought


1185
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.440
it could have been one
of those videos but,


1186
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:28.470
after everything
that's happened,


1187
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.370
I don't see how that's possible.

1188
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:32.110
- [Dale] That's the point,
darlin'.


1189
01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.050
Hell, I saw a video where
they abducted a guy and


1190
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.910
locked him in a coffin
for two days.


1191
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:38.420
It's whatever it takes to
break you down.


1192
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:39.680
- I feel like I'm going insane.

1193
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.790
- This is Thailand, love.

1194
01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.120
Everybody's a bit insane.

1195
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.320
How's about this?

1196
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.790
I'll head on into town and

1197
01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.760
do a little
just-in-case shopping.


1198
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.590
- Just-in-case shopping?

1199
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:53.330
- Oh, that's the best kind.

1200
01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.970
(dogs barking)

1201
01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.900
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1202
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:04.410
Stopped by my unit and got
you some clothes, love.


1203
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.210
Just-in-case shopping.

1204
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.680
(chuckling)

1205
01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.220
You think they're
filming us now?


1206
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.900
(telephone ringing)

1207
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.300
Hello?

1208
01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.940
This is Dale, mate.

1209
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.470
You think you're funny?

1210
01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.910
All right.

1211
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.480
Now, how's about you
shut your fucking mouth.


1212
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:43.610
First things first, we want
proof that everyone is okay.


1213
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:44.880
Until you satisfy
this requirement,


1214
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.720
we will not entertain
any of your requests.


1215
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:54.160
Well, it looks like you've
got some work to do, then.


1216
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.960
You best watch that
tone of yours.


1217
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:57.130
There's a shitstorm a-brewing.

1218
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.030
You do not want it
coming down on your head.


1219
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:02.930
That is right, mate, and
you best keep in mind


1220
01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:03.800
that I'm not like these
little sheilas


1221
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.100
you've been pushing around.

1222
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.070
I'm the real deal and I will
break you the fuck down.


1223
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:11.040
As far as I can see,
you've got two options.


1224
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.010
You either get me the proof
I've so cordially requested


1225
01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.910
or you confront me face to face.

1226
01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.420
I look forward to it.

1227
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:23.890
- Have you lost your
fucking mind?


1228
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.960
- Oh, calm down, love.

1229
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.060
Just rattling the cage
a little bit.


1230
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:27.530
- He's going to kill
all of them!


1231
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.790
- Listen, if he really
is a psychopath,


1232
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:32.160
I'm betting I'm the one
he wants to kill now


1233
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.170
and there is one thing
I can guarantee you,


1234
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.470
a walk down Thunder Road with
Dale is no kind of picnic.


1235
01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:46.980
What do you say we go
get ourselves


1236
01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:49.550
a couple of cold tinnies?

1237
01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:53.150
(upbeat electronic music)

1238
01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:57.920
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

1239
01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.190
- I'm not really in the mood.

1240
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.290
- How's Penny?

1241
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:04.800
- What can we do for you, mate?

1242
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:05.630
- Do you know where she is?

1243
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.530
Tell me!

1244
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.530
- Calm down, love, calm down.

1245
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:08.970
Have a seat.

1246
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.870
- Chill your chick out, man.

1247
01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.140
- What do you know about Penny?

1248
01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.270
- Some chick in a trucker
hat asked me to do it.


1249
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.270
- A chick?

1250
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.940
(telephone ringing)

1251
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.140
- Dale? The phone!

1252
01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.240
- Tell me about this chick.

1253
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.380
- Dale?

1254
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.210
- She was wearing a
trucker hat and that's it.


1255
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:24.080
That's all I know.

1256
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.950
- Phone?

1257
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.450
- Give me the phone, love.

1258
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.290
Hello?

1259
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:33.360
I believe there's a matter of
proof to be dealt with first.


1260
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:34.990
He hung up on Dale.

1261
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.060
- So what's the--

1262
01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.830
- It's time to take a walk, bro.

1263
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.070
- You got it.

1264
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:45.740
- We got somewhere to be, love.

1265
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.040
Get your beer.

1266
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.450
(suspenseful music)

1267
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.500
- Dale came up with a
ridiculous plan that he


1268
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:15.300
thinks is going to make
him look like a hero,


1269
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:16.940
so it's obvious that he
still thinks it's


1270
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:19.440
one of those internet videos.

1271
01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:29.110
I can't do this.

1272
01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.650
I keep asking myself what
would Penny do


1273
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.260
if she were in my place.

1274
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:45.330
I know exactly what she'd do.

1275
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:48.470
She's always been a strong--

1276
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.470
(screaming)

1277
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.240
(dramatic music)

1278
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.530
No, no, no, no, no.

1279
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.300
(dramatic music)

1280
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.550
(screaming)

1281
01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.020
My camera died last night.

1282
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.790
I thought I found a
safe place to sleep but


1283
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.060
I woke up in this new location,

1284
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:48.760
with my camera fully charged,

1285
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:51.600
in this ridiculous
fucking outfit.


1286
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:59.240
I'm just about tired of
being made fun of.


1287
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:11.080
(distant heavy metal music)

1288
01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.630
(hard-driving heavy metal music)

1289
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.290
(screaming)

1290
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.230
(screaming)

1291
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:12.260
(whimpering)

1292
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:23.540
(power saw revving)

1293
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:25.780
(screaming)

1294
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:32.520
(heavy metal music)

1295
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:37.320
(screaming)

1296
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.770
(sobbing)

1297
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:52.340
- Ladies and gentlemen!

1298
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:56.210
It is my profound pleasure
to introduce to you,


1299
01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.070
Miss Tabitha Humphries!

1300
01:23:57.110 --> 01:24:00.710
("Babygirl" by Rockapella)

1301
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.750
Babygirl

1302
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:12.260
Let me wrap these
arms around you


1303
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.530
Babygirl

1304
01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.160
Like you wrap my heart

1305
01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.370
Around your every move

1306
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.270
Let me cradle you tonight

1307
01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:30.540
Babygirl

1308
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:32.710
Babygirl

1309
01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.980
Now I said words
don't come easy


1310
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:38.550
In my world

1311
01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:45.190
But you opened up a
door to someplace new


1312
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:49.290
There's a wonderland inside

1313
01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.800
And all I'm feeling

1314
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:58.400
I can't hide

1315
01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.510
Say I'm the love of your life

1316
01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.340
I ain't afraid to say I'd die

1317
01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.780
Without you

1318
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:10.310
Tell me you're mine
from tonight


1319
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:11.210
It's clear to me

1320
01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:15.050
That I will always love you

1321
01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:18.320
Always

1322
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.630
Say to me

1323
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:29.130
Baby girl

1324
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.840
Oh, Baby girl

1325
01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.610
Baby girl

1326
01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.840
Baby girl

1327
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:46.650
- [Both] You've gotta take
the good with the bad,


1328
01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:49.490
smile with the sad,
love what you got,


1329
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.490
remember what you had,

1330
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.260
always forgive but never forget,

1331
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:57.460
learn from mistakes but
never regret.


1332
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:10.370
- I love you, Abby.

1333
01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:11.810
- Love you, too.

1334
01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:19.050
(upbeat jazzy polka-style music)

1335
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:10.530
- Excuse me, this seat taken?

1336
01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:12.970
- [Woman] No, sit down.

1337
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.640
- I'm John.

1338
01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:16.070
Pleasure to meet you.

1339
01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:18.310
- [Woman] Emily Tull.

1340
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:22.050
- Who knew Austria could
be so pretty, right?


1341
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.080
(upbeat jazzy polka-style music)
