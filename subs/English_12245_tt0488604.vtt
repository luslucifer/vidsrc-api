1
00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.569
Go!

2
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.439
Go!

3
00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:01.829
What's that?

4
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.739
It's a man!

5
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.819
- What? Is he dead?
- No, sir.


6
00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.729
He's writing!

7
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:09.949
Repeat!

8
00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.649
He's writing, sir

9
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:14.599
he's writing in a notebook!

10
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.899
That man was not mad.
He was working


11
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.859
with shrapnel whistling round him
because he couldn't wait.


12
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.369
The contents of that notebook
were too important


13
00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.049
to write it down later.

14
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.959
He had to do it
when his mind dictated,


15
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.699
he couldn't put it off
a single second.


16
00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.299
What was so important that
he would risk his life for it?


17
00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.819
What was he writing that
stopped him from standing up


18
00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.869
and running, like any other man
would have done?


19
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.679
The "tractatus
logico-philosophicus",


20
00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.849
the most influential philosophical
work of the twentieth century.


21
00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.419
That soldier was called
Ludwig wittgenstein,


22
00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:02.239
the man who set the limits
on our thoughts.


23
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.928
The enigma that
he tried to decipher


24
00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:07.888
was the following:

25
00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:14.578
Can we know the truth?

26
00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.358
All the great thinkers
throughout history


27
00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:21.268
have sought a single certainty,

28
00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:23.348
something which
no one can refute,


29
00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:25.998
like "two and two make four".

30
00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:29.048
In order to find that truth,

31
00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:31.128
wittgenstein used, in fact,

32
00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:35.648
mathematical logic. What better
means of obtaining a certainty


33
00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:39.338
than an immutable language,
free from the passions of men?


34
00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:44.858
He advanced slowly,
using equation after equation,


35
00:02:44.988 --> 00:02:47.768
with impeccable method,
until he reached


36
00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.768
a terrifying conclusion.

37
00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.198
There is no such truth

38
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.768
outside of mathematics.

39
00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:58.938
There is no way of finding

40
00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:01.458
a single absolute truth,

41
00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:03.498
an irrefutable argument

42
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:07.018
which might help answer
the questions of mankind.


43
00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:11.668
Philosophy, therefore, is dead.

44
00:03:13.448 --> 00:03:16.188
Because "whereof we cannot speak,

45
00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:20.788
thereof we must be silent."

46
00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:46.507
Don't touch that, please.

47
00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:48.547
This is an enigma machine!

48
00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:52.197
Just a copy. The original's in
the imperial war museum in London.


49
00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:55.287
Sorry to sneak in like that...
The door was open.


50
00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:59.157
Of course it was open. You surely
didn't expect me to get up


51
00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:00.887
and let you in
on these legs, did you?


52
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:02.327
I'm...

53
00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:08.317
Martin, our new overseas
student lodger, I presume.


54
00:05:09.537 --> 00:05:11.887
- This man in the photo with you...
- Yes.


55
00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:14.147
That's turing, Alan turing,

56
00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.137
the man who deciphered
the enigma code.


57
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.437
Thanks to him, we won the war.

58
00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:22.697
Poor man died
such a strange death...


59
00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:26.657
A poisoned apple, like snow white.

60
00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:29.307
And the one on the left?

61
00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.477
My husband, Harry.

62
00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:34.777
Harry eagleton. He developed the
concept of fractional dimensions...


63
00:05:34.957 --> 00:05:38.127
He deserved a bloody nobel prize,
but he hated sucking up


64
00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.817
to politicians.
Politicians or anybody.


65
00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:42.297
He never had many friends.

66
00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:45.637
He had one at least.
Arthur seldom.


67
00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:47.987
Poor boy. He spent day

68
00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:50.937
after day in the house,
tidying Harry's papers.


69
00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.767
He'd go without lunch or dinner,
going over the equations.


70
00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:59.237
Eagleton tutored his doctoral thesis
on the logical series. In 1960,


71
00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:02.407
- wasn't it?
- I see you've done your homework.


72
00:06:02.757 --> 00:06:05.187
I know everything there is
to know about Arthur seldom.


73
00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:07.627
In fact, Mrs. eagleton,
it's because of him that I'm here.


74
00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:09.367
In Oxford, I mean.

75
00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:13.146
I know what you mean.
Seldom is... unique.


76
00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:15.876
Every prize,
every acknowledgement


77
00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:20.446
he's received over the years
has been a real joy for me.


78
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.486
Careful, mother, or
your secret will be discovered.


79
00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.696
What secret?

80
00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:26.566
After daddy died,
you tried to marry him.


81
00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:29.696
How dare you!
That's not true.


82
00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:31.316
He's always been
like a brother to me.


83
00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:33.296
Only because there was no chance
of him being anything else.


84
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.566
Beth!

85
00:06:35.516 --> 00:06:37.516
There's no doubt
professor seldom is a genius,


86
00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.866
but there's one area
he's no different from other men.


87
00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:42.466
He likes young girls.

88
00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:46.376
Beth, darling, couldn't you stop
being so spiteful just for a second?


89
00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:47.726
Sorry, mother.

90
00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:50.726
Take no notice of us.
We're like two bitter old spinsters.


91
00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:55.156
Thank you, mother, for tarring me
with the same brush.


92
00:06:56.236 --> 00:06:57.256
I'm sorry,

93
00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.456
you are?

94
00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:01.366
I sent a fax a few weeks ago,
about renting a room.


95
00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.276
Ah, our overseas student.

96
00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.146
Why don't you
show him to his room?


97
00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:09.626
If I'd known,
I'd have rented a tux.


98
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.356
You look stunning.

99
00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.876
My daughter has
a concert tonight. That's all.


100
00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:15.316
A concert?

101
00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:17.836
I play the cello
in the sheldonian.


102
00:07:18.096 --> 00:07:20.226
- It's the local amateur orchestra.
- Yes.


103
00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:22.746
We're not quite
the London symphony.


104
00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:24.086
I... I love the cello.

105
00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:27.606
Me too. Maybe it's because
it's all I get to cuddle


106
00:07:27.736 --> 00:07:28.866
- these days.
- Beth.


107
00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.476
Please.
You'll scare the young man.


108
00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:31.646
Mother.

109
00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:33.956
My daughter's suitors
tend not to be


110
00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:35.516
around very long.

111
00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:36.896
Difficult character, you know.

112
00:07:37.476 --> 00:07:40.426
Having an old lady hovering in the
doorway doesn't exactly help either.


113
00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:43.036
Are you calling me a busybody?

114
00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:45.636
No, mother. You just want
to protect me, don't you?


115
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.336
Of course.

116
00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:48.816
My mother has this theory

117
00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:51.156
that unless a man lived
through the second world war


118
00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:52.856
he's not to be trusted.

119
00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:53.766
My daughter

120
00:07:54.026 --> 00:07:55.026
thinks I've gone a bit

121
00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:56.456
gaga, but she knows

122
00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:57.636
I'm right.

123
00:07:58.106 --> 00:08:00.196
The Nazis changed the wheels

124
00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:03.366
on that damned machine
every bloody day,


125
00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:07.106
that altered the code, and we
had to decipher it all over again.


126
00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:09.836
There were no computers
in those days,


127
00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:12.756
calculations were done by hand.

128
00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:15.275
You must have been very young.

129
00:08:15.445 --> 00:08:16.615
Time for me to go.

130
00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:19.095
Fancy a game of scrabble?

131
00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:35.775
Well, this is your study.

132
00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.075
I trust you'll be comfortable.

133
00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:39.335
It's perfect.

134
00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:42.075
You should also be thinking
of a supervisor


135
00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.295
for your thesis.

136
00:08:43.465 --> 00:08:46.505
I've had one in mind
for a long time; Arthur seldom.


137
00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:51.855
Your parents?

138
00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:53.065
Yeah.

139
00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:56.975
Very American.
Is it close to the beach?


140
00:08:57.155 --> 00:09:01.065
Not at all.
It's the desert, Arizona.


141
00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:02.845
It actually happens to be my home.

142
00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:06.145
Really? Lovely.

143
00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:08.185
Anyway...

144
00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:09.795
All the studies are shared.

145
00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:12.485
Your colleague is
also an overseas student.


146
00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:14.315
I'm sure we'll get on fine.

147
00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:15.835
By the way,

148
00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:20.095
I think you'll find professor seldom
only works as a researcher now.


149
00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:23.655
I know, but the college told me that
he could supervise my doctorate.


150
00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:25.265
Who told you that?

151
00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:27.435
I've got a fax...

152
00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:28.695
Here.

153
00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.255
I see.

154
00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:36.165
I'm sorry to say Mrs. keeman

155
00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.475
was being rather over-optimistic.
Also,


156
00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:39.865
she no longer works here.

157
00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:42.335
But there must be some way,
perhaps if I speak to him...


158
00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:43.945
You're free to talk
to whoever you want,


159
00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:48.075
of course, but I must
warn you professor seldom


160
00:09:48.205 --> 00:09:51.115
is not one for
this sort of spontaneity.


161
00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:52.895
If you take my advice,

162
00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:56.115
I suggest you approach your studies
in a more realistic way.


163
00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:59.285
I'm sure you'll find some excellent
tutors among our teaching staff


164
00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:02.625
who will more than understand
the nature of your work.


165
00:10:23.304 --> 00:10:25.394
- Don't take it out on the wall.
- Walls?


166
00:10:26.004 --> 00:10:28.764
Don't talk to me about walls. That's
all you get in this fucking city.


167
00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:32.474
Sorry, just letting off
a little steam.


168
00:10:32.644 --> 00:10:35.514
Well, at least they come in
handy for doing your homework.


169
00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:39.814
These? I was just trying to save
myself 16 years of practice.


170
00:10:41.254 --> 00:10:43.224
See, I'm trying to calculate
where I need to run,


171
00:10:43.254 --> 00:10:44.464
depending on where
the ball bounces,


172
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.294
and what height it makes contact

173
00:10:46.464 --> 00:10:47.464
with my racquet.

174
00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.894
Makes it easier. Here.

175
00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:57.284
See? It works.

176
00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:01.674
Yeah, and what would happen
if you played against a person?


177
00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:05.234
There would be more variables

178
00:11:05.404 --> 00:11:08.444
but it would still be possible
to work out the trajectory.


179
00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:11.314
Please.

180
00:11:48.634 --> 00:11:49.894
Give me time.

181
00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:52.724
I have to rethink my calculations.

182
00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:55.594
Okay.

183
00:12:08.404 --> 00:12:09.534
Thanks for the beating.

184
00:12:10.314 --> 00:12:11.704
Do you want to continue
letting off steam


185
00:12:11.884 --> 00:12:13.324
on your own
or do you prefer company?


186
00:12:15.274 --> 00:12:16.964
Wednesday, same time?

187
00:12:17.224 --> 00:12:20.913
Yes. Bring a proper squash racquet.
Makes life much easier.


188
00:12:22.043 --> 00:12:23.043
Okay.

189
00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:37.123
I see you're picking up
the local customs very quickly.


190
00:12:37.293 --> 00:12:38.643
I try my best.

191
00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:40.733
Maybe she can help you
with your doctoral thesis,


192
00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:43.123
since uncle Arthur
is out of the question.


193
00:12:43.383 --> 00:12:44.983
- Can nothing be done?
- No.


194
00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:48.453
And if you're suggesting my mother
have a word with him, forget it.


195
00:12:49.073 --> 00:12:50.373
I wasn't suggesting anything.

196
00:12:50.983 --> 00:12:54.063
Do you really expect me to believe
you chose this house by chance?


197
00:12:55.063 --> 00:12:57.063
No, not by chance, no.

198
00:12:57.453 --> 00:12:58.673
Nothing happens by chance.

199
00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:00.543
I wanted to meet
your mother, that's true,


200
00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:02.623
but I never planned to use her.

201
00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:04.493
There's no need to apologize.

202
00:13:05.323 --> 00:13:07.363
I like people who
go for what they want.


203
00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:08.973
I wish I was more like you.

204
00:13:09.493 --> 00:13:11.533
You're not missing much,
i assure you.


205
00:13:11.663 --> 00:13:12.963
Oh, really?

206
00:13:13.143 --> 00:13:15.573
You come here from another country,
all on your own,


207
00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:18.223
and no sooner do you get here
than you make friends with a girl.


208
00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:21.093
With two, I hope.
At least that's what I thought


209
00:13:21.263 --> 00:13:23.743
- until a moment ago.
- It's not just that.


210
00:13:24.223 --> 00:13:25.353
You're happy,

211
00:13:26.523 --> 00:13:28.363
you only have to look at
your face to see that.


212
00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:29.693
I try to be.

213
00:13:29.823 --> 00:13:30.993
How do you do it?

214
00:13:32.213 --> 00:13:33.303
It's easy.

215
00:13:33.473 --> 00:13:34.873
It's a case of going
with the flow.


216
00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:36.473
And what if it goes badly?

217
00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:42.593
I'd rather make mistakes
than do nothing.


218
00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:45.423
I'd rather mess up
than miss out completely.


219
00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:47.503
It works for me.

220
00:13:48.243 --> 00:13:49.503
You should try it.

221
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:02.803
Just a minute!

222
00:14:06.753 --> 00:14:08.403
I thought you might
find this interesting.


223
00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.363
Seldom is giving a lecture
on his latest book


224
00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:12.363
at merton college on the 24th!

225
00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:14.053
There's your big chance!

226
00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.743
There is no way
of finding a single


227
00:14:18.923 --> 00:14:22.433
absolute truth, an irrefutable
argument that might help to answer


228
00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:24.562
the questions of mankind.

229
00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:28.732
Philosophy, therefore, is dead.

230
00:14:30.392 --> 00:14:33.382
Because "whereof we cannot speak,

231
00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.122
thereof we must be silent."

232
00:14:53.412 --> 00:14:56.582
Oh, it seems that
someone does wish to speak.


233
00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:00.842
It appears you are not
in agreement with wittgenstein.


234
00:15:01.492 --> 00:15:05.322
That means either you have found
a contradiction in the arguments


235
00:15:05.452 --> 00:15:09.312
of the tractatus, or you have an
absolute truth to share with us all.


236
00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.702
I believe in the number pi.

237
00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:18.742
I'm sorry,
i didn't understand you.


238
00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:20.522
What was it
you said you believed in?


239
00:15:20.702 --> 00:15:25.002
In the number pi, in the golden
section, the fibonacci series.


240
00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:27.782
The essence of nature
is mathematical.


241
00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:30.082
There is a hidden meaning
beneath reality.


242
00:15:30.432 --> 00:15:34.252
Things are organized following
a model, a scheme, a logical series.


243
00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:36.512
Even the tiny snowflake

244
00:15:36.692 --> 00:15:39.642
includes a numerical basis
in its structure. Therefore,


245
00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:43.292
if we manage to discover
the secret meaning of numbers,


246
00:15:43.462 --> 00:15:45.942
we will know
the secret meaning of reality.


247
00:15:54.062 --> 00:15:55.152
Impressive!

248
00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.842
Translating his words into

249
00:15:58.022 --> 00:15:59.192
the queen's English,

250
00:16:01.322 --> 00:16:02.812
we find ourselves
faced with a fresh,


251
00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:06.012
rousing defence of mathematics,
as if numbers


252
00:16:06.192 --> 00:16:08.662
were pre-existing ideas in reality.

253
00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:11.402
Anyway, this is nothing new.

254
00:16:11.882 --> 00:16:14.832
Since man is incapable
of reconciling mind and matter,


255
00:16:15.012 --> 00:16:18.312
he tends to confer
some sort of entity on ideas,


256
00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:21.782
because he cannot bear the notion
that the purely abstract


257
00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:24.562
only exists in our brain.

258
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:31.861
The beauty and Harmony
of a snowflake.


259
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:36.691
How sweet!

260
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:38.031
The butterfly

261
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:39.731
that flutters its wings

262
00:16:39.901 --> 00:16:42.901
and causes a hurricane
on the other side of the world.


263
00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:46.031
We've been hearing about
that damn butterfly for decades,


264
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:50.281
but who has been able
to predict a single hurricane?


265
00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:57.761
Nobody!

266
00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:04.101
Tell me something...

267
00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:08.751
Where is the beauty
and Harmony in cancer?


268
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:11.531
What makes a cell

269
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:14.181
suddenly decide to turn itself
into a killer metastasis


270
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:17.831
and destroy the rest of
the cells in a healthy body?


271
00:17:19.661 --> 00:17:20.911
Does anyone know?

272
00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:24.871
No.

273
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:28.131
Because we'd rather think
of snowflakes


274
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:30.471
and butterflies than of pain,

275
00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:32.511
war

276
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:34.821
or that book.

277
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:37.291
Why?

278
00:17:37.951 --> 00:17:41.941
Because we need to think
that life has meaning,


279
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:45.251
that everything
is governed by logic


280
00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:47.551
and not by mere chance.

281
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:53.331
If I write 2 then 4 then 6,
then we feel good, because we know


282
00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:55.151
that next comes 8.

283
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:56.761
We can foresee it,

284
00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:59.281
we are not in the hands

285
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.671
of destiny.

286
00:18:02.231 --> 00:18:04.231
Unfortunately, however,

287
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.791
this has nothing to do with truth.

288
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:11.661
Don't you agree?

289
00:18:14.571 --> 00:18:15.571
This...

290
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.611
Is only fear.

291
00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:24.131
Sad...

292
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.481
But there you go.

293
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680
You must

294
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.470
be Martin.

295
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.510
At last we meet.

296
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.380
But, I don't get it,
are you leaving?


297
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.720
Yes, I'm leaving. It was a mistake.
It was all a big mistake.


298
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.980
Things have not turned out
as you expected, I guess.


299
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.630
No, they haven't.
You bet they haven't.


300
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.060
I hope the hastiness
of your decision


301
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.280
has nothing to do with

302
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.450
professor seldom.

303
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.450
News travels fast in Oxford.

304
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.530
We are a little village of gossips.

305
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.620
Anyway, I think you are wrong
about the great Sage.


306
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.490
He was the best in his day, but...

307
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.700
Now he just wants to sell books.
Like those assholes.


308
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.180
A real seldom fan, eh?

309
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.610
I have a framed photo
of him in my room.


310
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.040
So he refused you too?

311
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.780
I would rather jump out of
a window than ask him for help.


312
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.080
I want nothing to do
with him or his books.


313
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.210
I prefer the reader's digest.

314
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880
Taxi!

315
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.780
Hello.

316
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.910
Ah, we've got
the book you wanted!


317
00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:35.249
There.

318
00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:20.739
Fucking hell!

319
00:22:22.349 --> 00:22:23.609
What are you doing here?

320
00:22:24.129 --> 00:22:25.479
I live here.
What's your excuse?


321
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:28.999
I came to visit an old friend.

322
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:31.469
I'm sorry about before.

323
00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:33.529
No, don't apologize.
I talked a lot of rubbish.


324
00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:35.219
I tend to overact
when I have an audience.


325
00:22:35.249 --> 00:22:37.328
The truth is I just wanted
to attract your attention.


326
00:22:38.688 --> 00:22:40.028
You succeeded.

327
00:22:49.328 --> 00:22:50.678
September the 24th,

328
00:22:50.848 --> 00:22:53.498
1993. Inspector petersen,
Oxford police station.


329
00:22:53.678 --> 00:22:57.058
Investigating the murder
of Mrs. Julia eagleton.


330
00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:00.758
According to this report,
you and professor Arthur seldom


331
00:23:00.928 --> 00:23:03.798
discovered the body...
At the same time.


332
00:23:04.668 --> 00:23:07.008
Yes, we entered
the room together.


333
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:10.268
Are you one of
professor seldom's students?


334
00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:11.838
No.

335
00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:15.138
- Do you work for him?
- No.


336
00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:17.658
Can you explain
why you were there together?


337
00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:18.828
No.

338
00:23:20.788 --> 00:23:22.478
To tell you the truth, I can't.

339
00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:24.778
I was also surprised
to see him there.


340
00:23:25.998 --> 00:23:28.388
So it was pure coincidence?

341
00:23:28.558 --> 00:23:30.998
Everything seems to point
to that being the case.


342
00:23:33.248 --> 00:23:37.728
And was this the first time
you'd seen professor seldom?


343
00:23:37.898 --> 00:23:41.548
Not exactly. I was at
a conference he gave this morning.


344
00:23:42.678 --> 00:23:44.248
I asked him a few questions.

345
00:23:44.768 --> 00:23:45.988
What sort of questions?

346
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:47.588
Mathematical ones.

347
00:23:57.058 --> 00:23:59.058
It's not by chance that I went

348
00:23:59.238 --> 00:24:00.798
to Mrs. eagleton's house
this afternoon.


349
00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:03.578
I went there because
the murderer told me to.


350
00:24:03.748 --> 00:24:05.358
The murderer warned you?

351
00:24:06.008 --> 00:24:09.188
Yes, I received a note
during the conference.


352
00:24:09.358 --> 00:24:10.918
What did it say?

353
00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:12.658
Just one sentence:

354
00:24:13.358 --> 00:24:14.828
"The first of the series,"

355
00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:18.008
written in capital letters.
Underneath,


356
00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:20.398
Mrs. eagleton's address

357
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:22.178
and the time.

358
00:24:22.518 --> 00:24:23.998
Can we see it?

359
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:25.958
No.

360
00:24:26.608 --> 00:24:27.648
Why?

361
00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:29.998
I threw it away.

362
00:24:30.388 --> 00:24:32.598
You threw away
a vital piece of evidence?


363
00:24:35.948 --> 00:24:38.208
Yes, well, let me explain.

364
00:24:39.207 --> 00:24:41.027
After the conference,

365
00:24:41.207 --> 00:24:44.247
I signed a number of copies.
When I'd finished, I set off home.


366
00:24:45.247 --> 00:24:49.457
And that is when I realized
that the address on the note


367
00:24:49.627 --> 00:24:51.017
was familiar

368
00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:53.457
but honestly, I...

369
00:24:53.627 --> 00:24:57.927
It just never occurred to me that
anything like this could happen.


370
00:24:58.757 --> 00:25:01.017
Of course, when I got there,
it was too late.


371
00:25:14.787 --> 00:25:16.137
We should call the police.

372
00:25:16.347 --> 00:25:17.437
You're right.

373
00:25:18.997 --> 00:25:20.127
Call them.

374
00:25:22.997 --> 00:25:24.387
999.

375
00:25:24.567 --> 00:25:25.567
Hello,

376
00:25:25.737 --> 00:25:27.817
I'm calling to report a death.

377
00:25:28.907 --> 00:25:30.517
3 cunliffe close.

378
00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:33.687
It's an old woman.

379
00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:35.947
Thank you.

380
00:25:37.597 --> 00:25:38.947
What do you think happened?

381
00:25:39.377 --> 00:25:40.547
I don't know.

382
00:25:41.247 --> 00:25:43.637
We should wait outside.
We'd better not touch anything.


383
00:25:43.807 --> 00:25:45.377
I shouldn't have
even used this phone.


384
00:25:45.637 --> 00:25:48.897
Try to etch on your memory
everything you can see.


385
00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:51.197
This moment is crucial.

386
00:25:51.497 --> 00:25:53.587
She was playing scrabble
when it happened.


387
00:25:53.847 --> 00:25:55.017
Was she playing on her own?

388
00:25:55.497 --> 00:25:58.317
Yes, she has both
the letter racks on her side.


389
00:25:58.797 --> 00:26:00.407
You don't think she's been killed?

390
00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:03.797
I can't see any other alternative.

391
00:26:07.747 --> 00:26:10.097
Whoever did this obviously
intended to smother her


392
00:26:10.317 --> 00:26:11.527
with the cushion
while she was sleeping.


393
00:26:11.707 --> 00:26:13.397
She wakes up, puts up a struggle,

394
00:26:13.657 --> 00:26:16.217
he presses down harder,
using both hands perhaps,


395
00:26:16.397 --> 00:26:18.867
breaks her nose, hence the blood.

396
00:26:19.267 --> 00:26:20.827
Or it could have been a woman,

397
00:26:20.957 --> 00:26:23.437
using her knee
to add extra pressure.


398
00:26:24.437 --> 00:26:26.907
When the killer removes
the cushion, sees the blood,


399
00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:28.647
he drops it on the carpet
and doesn't even bother


400
00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:30.427
to put anything back in its place.

401
00:26:30.607 --> 00:26:32.037
Scared, probably.

402
00:26:34.557 --> 00:26:35.557
In the book

403
00:26:35.687 --> 00:26:38.897
that I based my conference on,
i unfortunately


404
00:26:39.247 --> 00:26:42.856
compare logical series
with serial murders.


405
00:26:43.326 --> 00:26:45.586
And since its publication
I've received


406
00:26:45.766 --> 00:26:47.376
dozens of totally absurd letters,

407
00:26:47.506 --> 00:26:49.196
which is why I attached
little importance to this one.


408
00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:51.626
And you're sure you destroyed it?

409
00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:55.536
Well, no, I threw it away
in the street.


410
00:26:55.716 --> 00:26:56.756
Where?

411
00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:01.576
Well, somewhere near
the sheldonian theatre.


412
00:27:01.706 --> 00:27:04.616
Scott, get on to it,
it might still be there.


413
00:27:04.746 --> 00:27:06.406
The road sweepers
will have passed through by now.


414
00:27:06.576 --> 00:27:09.746
It doesn't matter. We'll search
the dust carts, if necessary.


415
00:27:10.396 --> 00:27:14.266
Now is there anything else? Anything
else that caught your attention?


416
00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:17.046
Oh, uh, under the text

417
00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:19.916
there was a hand-drawn circle,

418
00:27:21.216 --> 00:27:22.826
a perfect circle,

419
00:27:24.306 --> 00:27:25.996
also in black.

420
00:27:27.556 --> 00:27:28.866
About...

421
00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:33.386
This size,

422
00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:36.506
approximately.

423
00:27:38.506 --> 00:27:39.686
A circle?

424
00:27:40.546 --> 00:27:41.726
Like a signature?

425
00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:44.116
Oh no, I'm almost convinced
it was a symbol,


426
00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:46.246
the first element
of a logical series.


427
00:27:47.506 --> 00:27:49.416
Well, excuse my ignorance,

428
00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:52.416
I must have been off school
the day they taught


429
00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:53.756
logical series.

430
00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:55.756
A logical series

431
00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:57.536
is a group of elements
that succeed one another,


432
00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:59.056
following a particular rule.

433
00:27:59.236 --> 00:28:00.366
Could be 1, 2, 3, 4...

434
00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:02.926
Or even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8...

435
00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:06.316
Or of course it could be
the fibonacci series.


436
00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:08.226
Fibonacci?

437
00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:09.836
A 12th-century mathematician.

438
00:28:10.006 --> 00:28:14.526
Each element is the sum of the two
previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 6,


439
00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:17.346
- 8, 13...
- Look, I still don't see


440
00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:20.476
the relationship between
the murder and these series.


441
00:28:20.656 --> 00:28:24.086
I'm sorry. In my book I sustain
the theory that the murder committed


442
00:28:24.306 --> 00:28:27.426
for intellectual reasons
does not exist in the real world.


443
00:28:28.476 --> 00:28:31.516
In general, the patterns
followed by a serial killer


444
00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:35.206
are crude, monotonous
and repetitive,


445
00:28:35.376 --> 00:28:38.686
cases that can be analyzed
psychologically, not logically.


446
00:28:38.856 --> 00:28:42.506
So you think the murderer is
killing to prove something to you?


447
00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:46.375
Yes, sadly, I believe
that to be the case.


448
00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:48.415
Murderer wants to prove me wrong.

449
00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:50.365
He wants to show that
he's more intelligent than I am


450
00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.935
and that he can beat me

451
00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:55.235
at my own game.
Somehow he knew of my friendship


452
00:28:55.405 --> 00:28:58.885
with Mrs. eagleton,
and decided to begin there.


453
00:28:59.055 --> 00:29:01.625
How about this circle?
How do you explain this?


454
00:29:01.885 --> 00:29:04.445
Oh, a circle's a good way
to start a logical series.


455
00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:06.185
There's no symbol
more indeterminate.


456
00:29:06.405 --> 00:29:07.925
Could mean almost anything.

457
00:29:08.095 --> 00:29:12.045
So you mean there's gonna be
another murder after this one?


458
00:29:12.395 --> 00:29:13.655
I'm afraid so.

459
00:29:15.745 --> 00:29:17.525
And if we don't
discover it in time,


460
00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.565
could be many more.

461
00:29:19.735 --> 00:29:21.385
Okay, we are going to change

462
00:29:21.565 --> 00:29:24.045
some notes please in part 12.

463
00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:26.825
We knew she was going
to die at any time,


464
00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:29.255
but never like this.

465
00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:32.645
The doctors gave her 6 months
to live, 6 years ago.


466
00:29:33.035 --> 00:29:36.245
Thanks to Beth's nursing
she had an extra lease of life,


467
00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:38.205
like a blessing from heaven.

468
00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:41.245
Maybe that's why
the murderer chose her.


469
00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:43.635
How do you mean?

470
00:29:43.935 --> 00:29:46.415
If he is trying to demonstrate
something purely intellectual,


471
00:29:46.585 --> 00:29:49.025
maybe the deaths in themselves
don't interest him.


472
00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:52.155
Maybe his aim is to inflict
as little harm as possible.


473
00:29:52.325 --> 00:29:54.455
He chose someone
that should have died.


474
00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.925
He probably knew Mrs. eagleton
was receiving treatment...


475
00:29:57.105 --> 00:29:59.405
She went every week
to st Joseph's hospital.


476
00:29:59.575 --> 00:30:03.015
He could have found out about her
illness there, and that made her


477
00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:04.965
the perfect victim for him.

478
00:30:05.315 --> 00:30:06.405
Go on.

479
00:30:07.615 --> 00:30:09.355
If he hadn't broken her nose,

480
00:30:09.525 --> 00:30:11.705
it would have looked
like death by natural causes.


481
00:30:11.965 --> 00:30:14.145
In that case, only you
would have known what happened.


482
00:30:14.175 --> 00:30:15.875
The police would never
have been involved.


483
00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:18.135
It would have been
a private challenge.


484
00:30:18.345 --> 00:30:20.175
A murder that almost isn't a murder.

485
00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:21.995
That makes sense.

486
00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:24.865
What do you think
he would do next?


487
00:30:25.565 --> 00:30:27.775
I suppose he'll try
to be more careful.


488
00:30:28.255 --> 00:30:31.165
He'll commit another murder
that almost isn't a murder.


489
00:30:32.465 --> 00:30:35.205
An imperceptible murder...

490
00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.375
Excuse me.

491
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:48.974
Excuse me, officers,
but I need to speak


492
00:30:49.154 --> 00:30:50.994
to miss eagleton first,
to break the bad news,


493
00:30:51.024 --> 00:30:53.284
to her, if that's all right.
Thank you.


494
00:31:00.014 --> 00:31:01.404
You have a c,

495
00:31:01.574 --> 00:31:04.404
b flat, and c sharp.

496
00:31:04.574 --> 00:31:06.354
Excuse me, please,
i can talk to him?


497
00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:09.314
Yes, so

498
00:31:09.484 --> 00:31:10.834
you have a c, b flat,

499
00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:12.394
and c sharp.

500
00:31:14.004 --> 00:31:16.954
Oh, no, no, no. You have a b,
a c sharp, and c natural...


501
00:31:18.084 --> 00:31:19.134
Oh, okay,

502
00:31:19.734 --> 00:31:21.344
let's do a break, please.

503
00:31:56.274 --> 00:31:58.684
The police told me that you
were the one who found the body.


504
00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.404
Forgive me, Beth.
I'm really sorry.


505
00:32:00.574 --> 00:32:02.654
They asked me to try
and remember every detail and...


506
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:05.744
It's no problem.
I understand.


507
00:32:08.964 --> 00:32:11.404
It must have been difficult
for you to go through all of this.


508
00:32:12.044 --> 00:32:14.044
Two hours of interrogation.

509
00:32:14.394 --> 00:32:17.174
It's logical, though, bearing
in mind I'm the chief suspect.


510
00:32:17.344 --> 00:32:18.564
Did they tell you that?

511
00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:21.394
No. No, they didn't have to.

512
00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:24.084
You don't need to be
a detective to realize


513
00:32:24.214 --> 00:32:26.184
that I'm the one who
most benefits from all this.


514
00:32:26.214 --> 00:32:29.604
But you looked after her
for years. Seldom told me.


515
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:31.904
Five years...

516
00:32:32.644 --> 00:32:35.164
Five years of waiting
for her to drop dead.


517
00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:38.244
Forgive me for being
so cruelly Sincere,


518
00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:40.554
but if anyone wanted this
to end, it was me.


519
00:32:44.284 --> 00:32:46.724
Do you know what it is
to wake up every morning


520
00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:49.504
wondering when you're going
to have a life of your own?


521
00:32:50.154 --> 00:32:52.583
I couldn't abandon her,
she was my mother.


522
00:32:53.453 --> 00:32:56.753
She had cancer but it was supposed
to be a question of months.


523
00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:02.313
You want this person you're supposed
to be looking after to disappear


524
00:33:02.493 --> 00:33:03.663
and at the same time you know

525
00:33:03.793 --> 00:33:05.833
there's something evil in you
for thinking that way.


526
00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:08.533
You hate yourself

527
00:33:08.703 --> 00:33:10.383
for the thoughts
that go through your head.


528
00:33:11.263 --> 00:33:12.833
It's like being rotten inside.

529
00:33:12.963 --> 00:33:15.563
Beth, you've no need to worry.

530
00:33:16.393 --> 00:33:17.743
Seldom got a note.

531
00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:20.303
Someone warned him of
what was going to happen,


532
00:33:20.473 --> 00:33:22.953
- and is threatening to do it again.
- Who?


533
00:33:23.083 --> 00:33:24.383
No one knows.

534
00:33:32.383 --> 00:33:34.513
They made me go to the morgue
to look at the body.


535
00:33:35.903 --> 00:33:37.593
Her eyes were still open.

536
00:33:37.763 --> 00:33:39.113
Don't think about it.

537
00:33:45.063 --> 00:33:47.453
I don't think I can sleep
upstairs tonight.


538
00:33:47.723 --> 00:33:49.453
Is it okay
if I stay here with you?


539
00:34:01.753 --> 00:34:03.013
I'm sorry.

540
00:34:03.183 --> 00:34:04.963
Don't be... it's okay.

541
00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:09.003
I don't know what you must
think of me. I'm so embarrassed.


542
00:34:09.263 --> 00:34:11.093
Beth, please. Don't go.

543
00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:30.423
Congratulations! Your name
in the papers and with seldom!


544
00:34:30.603 --> 00:34:33.513
Knock off the old lady
to attract attention, did you?


545
00:34:33.683 --> 00:34:35.293
Not so fast!

546
00:34:36.463 --> 00:34:37.983
Your friend is lucky.

547
00:34:38.553 --> 00:34:41.503
Always close to death,
but never touched by it.


548
00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:44.633
Didn't you know?

549
00:34:45.153 --> 00:34:46.513
Thirty years ago,
the four of them


550
00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:49.193
- were travelling together.
- What are you talking about?


551
00:34:49.373 --> 00:34:52.883
Mrs. eagleton's husband
and seldom's wife were killed.


552
00:34:53.283 --> 00:34:54.883
And guess who was driving.

553
00:34:56.232 --> 00:34:58.712
And now the old lady is dead.

554
00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:01.312
Three down, one to go.

555
00:35:04.662 --> 00:35:06.442
This is miss Scarlet

556
00:35:06.612 --> 00:35:09.002
and she is in the dining room.
Now we know that the murder


557
00:35:09.182 --> 00:35:10.092
took place in the dining room,

558
00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:12.262
don't we? And that the victim
was killed with a cushion,


559
00:35:12.442 --> 00:35:13.572
but since we don't have

560
00:35:13.742 --> 00:35:16.002
a cushion, we'll use
the nasty little knife.


561
00:35:17.872 --> 00:35:18.882
Now I'll stick

562
00:35:18.912 --> 00:35:21.052
my neck out and say that
miss Scarlet was the murderer


563
00:35:21.082 --> 00:35:23.122
in the living room,
with the knife.


564
00:35:24.302 --> 00:35:25.432
What do you think?

565
00:35:25.602 --> 00:35:27.822
Clue didn't figure
into my degree course.


566
00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:29.122
Cleudo!

567
00:35:30.382 --> 00:35:32.142
It's recommended reading
in police academies.


568
00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:34.592
In the papers,

569
00:35:35.462 --> 00:35:38.112
Beth appears as the chief suspect.

570
00:35:38.292 --> 00:35:39.682
But the police know all the facts.

571
00:35:41.852 --> 00:35:45.852
Ah, I forgot that I was talking
to the champion of universal logic.


572
00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:47.282
Thank you.

573
00:35:47.892 --> 00:35:51.322
You and the police think that it's
possible to demonstrate the truth.


574
00:35:51.672 --> 00:35:52.412
On the basis

575
00:35:52.582 --> 00:35:54.622
of certain axioms
and by using valid reasoning,


576
00:35:54.802 --> 00:35:57.362
you can reach a valid conclusion,
isn't that so?


577
00:35:57.532 --> 00:35:59.752
As sure as today is Wednesday.

578
00:35:59.922 --> 00:36:03.362
And what if I say,
"all britons are liars"?


579
00:36:04.402 --> 00:36:06.792
True, false
or impossible to prove?


580
00:36:07.312 --> 00:36:09.922
All right. There are
mathematical formulations


581
00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:12.832
that can neither be proved
nor refuted starting from axioms.


582
00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:14.742
Indeterminable propositions.

583
00:36:14.912 --> 00:36:17.652
Exactly, gцdel's
incompleteness theorem.


584
00:36:17.912 --> 00:36:20.262
So, even in your world
of mathematical purity,


585
00:36:20.432 --> 00:36:22.692
there are things
that can never be proven.


586
00:36:22.862 --> 00:36:24.992
Yes, but that is not the case here.

587
00:36:25.912 --> 00:36:27.212
There is a gap,

588
00:36:28.292 --> 00:36:32.072
there is a Gulf between
what is true and what is provable.


589
00:36:32.292 --> 00:36:33.592
We can never be sure

590
00:36:33.772 --> 00:36:35.552
of all the facts about a phenomenon,

591
00:36:35.722 --> 00:36:38.812
and to lack just one, could change
everything. Even if we know


592
00:36:38.982 --> 00:36:39.982
that the murder

593
00:36:40.112 --> 00:36:41.942
took place in the dining room
with the knife,


594
00:36:42.152 --> 00:36:45.242
and that miss Scarlet was there
at the exact moment of the murder,


595
00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:47.542
and that her fingerprints

596
00:36:47.712 --> 00:36:49.062
were on the knife, we can never

597
00:36:49.242 --> 00:36:52.232
affirm with absolute certainty
that she committed the crime.


598
00:36:52.412 --> 00:36:56.012
Oh, come on! It's

599
00:36:57.142 --> 00:37:00.321
That's not absolute certainty,
that is an opinion.


600
00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:02.181
We could have absolute certainty

601
00:37:02.361 --> 00:37:03.531
if we trusted the word
of an eye-witness,


602
00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:07.011
or we saw it with our own eyes.
I trust my own eyes.


603
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:09.921
No comment.

604
00:37:10.131 --> 00:37:12.831
Things are here, under our noses.

605
00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:15.431
These paving stones. They exist!

606
00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:17.261
Or do you refute that
as well? You can't.


607
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:20.081
Are you sure? Heisenberg
wasn't quite as certain.


608
00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:22.261
The physicist?

609
00:37:22.431 --> 00:37:24.731
Yes, well, he tried to make
an atom bomb for the Nazis,


610
00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:26.121
but he wasn't famous for that.

611
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.511
What is this? An exam? Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle".


612
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:33.161
Bingo! Miss Scarlet
is now an electron, okay?


613
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:35.051
And you're looking at her
through a keyhole,


614
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.161
or a particle accelerator,
as you wish.


615
00:37:37.331 --> 00:37:38.591
And every time you look at her,

616
00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:42.411
miss Scarlet will have
changed her appearance or...


617
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:43.981
Her position.

618
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:46.021
Because the very fact
that you observe her


619
00:37:46.241 --> 00:37:48.671
alters her atomic state.
How about that?


620
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:50.711
Don't try to confuse me with tricks.

621
00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:53.671
Beth is not an electron,
and neither is Mrs. eagleton.


622
00:37:53.801 --> 00:37:56.101
So, do you really think
that criminal investigation


623
00:37:56.271 --> 00:37:58.531
is more reliable
than physics or mathematics?


624
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:00.921
There are evident,
irrefutable facts.


625
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:02.791
For Christ's sake,

626
00:38:02.921 --> 00:38:05.441
can you turn that bloody thing
off for a minute?


627
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:14.221
Unfortunately, the police
were unable to find the note.


628
00:38:14.391 --> 00:38:17.391
Consequently, we have
no material evidence whatsoever.


629
00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.301
Not a thing!

630
00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:21.691
Imagine if that bloody psychopath

631
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:24.301
gets the wind up
and decides not to kill again...


632
00:38:24.781 --> 00:38:27.381
Beth will be declared guilty.

633
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:33.381
I'd love to know
who it is you hate so much.


634
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:36.981
Myself.

635
00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:41.031
I read the news in the papers.
You're not to blame for anything.


636
00:38:41.551 --> 00:38:43.021
The worst thing is...

637
00:38:43.681 --> 00:38:45.241
This is embarrassing...

638
00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:48.501
Thanks to that
poor woman's death,


639
00:38:48.631 --> 00:38:50.151
I've just had lunch
with Arthur seldom.


640
00:38:50.281 --> 00:38:53.711
Before, he didn't
even know I existed, but now...


641
00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:55.671
I'm sorry about what

642
00:38:55.841 --> 00:39:00.181
has happened but at the same time,
i swear I can't help feeling happy.


643
00:39:00.751 --> 00:39:03.010
Never, in my life, have i
enjoyed myself so much.


644
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.050
One hour with seldom is like
a lifetime with anybody else.


645
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.180
Well, you know,

646
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.390
there's nothing embarrassing
about Sincere feelings.


647
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.650
Are you sure about that?

648
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:21.910
Spend an hour with me?

649
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.230
You have something to drink?

650
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.930
- No.
- Great.


651
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?


652
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.370
What's wrong?

653
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.590
Nothing, it's... sorry.

654
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.370
It's seldom.

655
00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.640
Just strange that you should
have read this book too.


656
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.620
- A nurse interested in mathematics.
- Well, not really.


657
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.530
It was the author who interested me.
He gave it to me.


658
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.270
- You know seldom?
- Of course I do.


659
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.180
- See him almost every day.
- What?


660
00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:08.739
He visits a friend
at the hospital,


661
00:41:09.009 --> 00:41:10.529
a terminal patient.

662
00:41:11.399 --> 00:41:13.479
One day we began to chat and...

663
00:41:13.649 --> 00:41:14.739
And what?

664
00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:17.299
And he gave me the book.

665
00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:20.519
- That's all?
- You're jealous?


666
00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:24.119
He could be yourfather... your
grandfather, come to think of it.


667
00:41:24.249 --> 00:41:25.299
Yeah.

668
00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:29.249
I just like mystery novels,

669
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.639
he was here for a while,
we had a laugh,


670
00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:34.199
I gave him a couple of my books
and he gave me his.


671
00:41:34.509 --> 00:41:37.379
- Is that a crime?
- No... of course not.


672
00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:43.239
Can you get him out of your mind,

673
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:45.329
please?

674
00:41:46.019 --> 00:41:48.419
I just don't understand why
you didn't tell me to begin with.


675
00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:51.539
What do you want?

676
00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:54.219
A list of all the people
who have passed through here?


677
00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:56.709
- No.
- Good.


678
00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:05.139
Everything you read
in the papers is a lie.


679
00:43:07.479 --> 00:43:08.528
Did you know that?

680
00:43:09.478 --> 00:43:10.958
No, uh...
I don't pay much attention.


681
00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.128
- Have you read the Bible?
- Not all of it.


682
00:43:13.648 --> 00:43:17.258
Jesus died on the cross
and then rose on the third day.


683
00:43:17.478 --> 00:43:18.818
But in body and soul,

684
00:43:19.558 --> 00:43:20.948
at least so they say.

685
00:43:21.558 --> 00:43:24.168
He ate fish and spoke to Peter.

686
00:43:24.298 --> 00:43:26.468
That's how he spent forty days.

687
00:43:26.858 --> 00:43:28.118
Forty days!

688
00:43:28.428 --> 00:43:31.418
He must have been green,
and have stunk to high heaven.


689
00:43:32.468 --> 00:43:33.938
Hey, wait, wait.

690
00:43:34.118 --> 00:43:35.468
Jesus was a terrorist.

691
00:43:38.458 --> 00:43:39.898
All his life.

692
00:43:41.068 --> 00:43:45.328
A revolutionary who kicked
money changers out of the temple.


693
00:43:46.668 --> 00:43:48.348
Do you know why
he came back from the dead?


694
00:43:48.498 --> 00:43:51.108
- No, theoretically...
- Jesus


695
00:43:51.448 --> 00:43:54.358
came back to life to avenge
himself on his murderers.


696
00:43:54.538 --> 00:43:55.578
Like in a horror movie.

697
00:43:57.878 --> 00:44:01.318
Of course, that's not nice.
That's not interesting.


698
00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:04.698
You can go in now, your daughter

699
00:44:04.878 --> 00:44:06.118
- is expecting you.
- All right.


700
00:44:10.828 --> 00:44:12.218
What are you doing here?

701
00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:15.648
I had the urge to see you,
that's all. Do you mind?


702
00:44:16.218 --> 00:44:17.388
You're lying.

703
00:44:17.558 --> 00:44:18.688
How do you know?

704
00:44:18.998 --> 00:44:20.608
I didn't, I do now.

705
00:44:21.298 --> 00:44:23.518
You're here to see
seldom's friend, aren't you?


706
00:44:23.688 --> 00:44:26.208
You should have seen the look
on your face when I mentioned him.


707
00:44:26.988 --> 00:44:29.188
And how are you going to explain
what you're doing here?


708
00:44:29.338 --> 00:44:31.078
I'll tell him I came to see you.

709
00:44:31.768 --> 00:44:32.988
You swine.

710
00:44:46.938 --> 00:44:48.798
Who is that guy?
He's nuts.


711
00:44:49.278 --> 00:44:51.708
Well, you would be too
if your daughter needed a transplant


712
00:44:51.838 --> 00:44:53.408
and you couldn't find a donor.

713
00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:55.278
There were two people
that could have been compatible,


714
00:44:55.448 --> 00:44:56.968
but their families refused.

715
00:44:57.318 --> 00:44:58.538
Now I get it.

716
00:44:58.878 --> 00:45:00.318
You know, he thought
of committing suicide


717
00:45:00.488 --> 00:45:02.488
in order to give her his lungs.

718
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:04.228
That's ridiculous.

719
00:45:04.488 --> 00:45:06.828
Giving your life for someone
you love is ridiculous?


720
00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:11.997
His name is kalman,

721
00:45:12.127 --> 00:45:13.957
one of my most brilliant students.

722
00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:15.447
He was quick in his conclusions,

723
00:45:15.477 --> 00:45:16.697
clear in his exposition.

724
00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:20.127
He designed intelligence tests.
I initiated him


725
00:45:20.297 --> 00:45:22.647
into the study of logical series.

726
00:45:22.817 --> 00:45:24.857
He was meticulous,
to the point of obsession.


727
00:45:25.037 --> 00:45:26.597
He marked the tests himself,

728
00:45:26.777 --> 00:45:28.117
one by one, and discovered

729
00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:29.597
something really curious:

730
00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:32.767
Some of the tests were perfect;
The majority had a few mistakes.


731
00:45:32.947 --> 00:45:35.507
But there was a third group.

732
00:45:35.637 --> 00:45:37.637
The answers were absurd,
incomprehensible,


733
00:45:37.847 --> 00:45:39.067
illogical, random,

734
00:45:39.247 --> 00:45:41.197
the sort of thing
that a lunatic would write.


735
00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:42.497
Kalman interviewed

736
00:45:42.627 --> 00:45:44.197
the pupils of this third category.

737
00:45:44.677 --> 00:45:46.667
The answers that
he had considered absurd


738
00:45:46.927 --> 00:45:49.317
were, in fact,
another possible solution


739
00:45:49.497 --> 00:45:50.507
and perfectly valid

740
00:45:50.537 --> 00:45:51.627
to continue the series,

741
00:45:51.797 --> 00:45:54.617
only with an infinitely
more complex justification.


742
00:45:55.097 --> 00:45:57.007
The intelligence of these pupils

743
00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.927
went beyond
the conventional solution and was


744
00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.487
much more far-reaching.

745
00:46:04.307 --> 00:46:07.397
It was then that I had
to break the bad news to him.


746
00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:11.657
Wittgenstein's paradox
concerning finite rules.


747
00:46:12.127 --> 00:46:13.957
Kalman found in practice

748
00:46:14.127 --> 00:46:15.957
what wittgenstein
discovered decades before.


749
00:46:16.127 --> 00:46:17.297
The series 2, 4, 8,

750
00:46:17.477 --> 00:46:18.687
could obviously be followed

751
00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:21.337
by 16, but also by 10

752
00:46:21.687 --> 00:46:23.597
or 7004.

753
00:46:24.167 --> 00:46:26.687
It's always possible
to find a rule,


754
00:46:26.857 --> 00:46:28.507
a justification which allows

755
00:46:28.687 --> 00:46:30.897
a series to be continued
by any number.


756
00:46:31.507 --> 00:46:33.467
It all depends on
how complicated the rule is.


757
00:46:33.597 --> 00:46:36.547
Suddenly, he realized
that he couldn't even trust


758
00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:37.457
the two times table.

759
00:46:37.637 --> 00:46:40.367
His whole life was being
sucked into a whirlpool


760
00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:42.157
of meaningless numbers.

761
00:46:42.327 --> 00:46:45.147
Normal thought seems to be
guided by certain grooves


762
00:46:45.327 --> 00:46:47.237
etched into our brain

763
00:46:47.407 --> 00:46:48.977
which impede
our leaving that track


764
00:46:49.147 --> 00:46:50.847
and jumping it like the chosen few

765
00:46:51.017 --> 00:46:53.407
who are able to think
without limitations.


766
00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:56.017
Kalman decided
to take a strange path.


767
00:46:56.187 --> 00:46:57.877
He began to try out his tests

768
00:46:58.007 --> 00:47:00.877
in psychiatric hospitals,
on lobotomized patients.


769
00:47:01.007 --> 00:47:02.657
There was a remarkable similarity

770
00:47:02.837 --> 00:47:04.527
between those symbols

771
00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:06.097
and the results of the tests

772
00:47:06.267 --> 00:47:07.527
of the highly-gifted subjects.

773
00:47:07.957 --> 00:47:10.177
He was in the presence
of pure thought,


774
00:47:10.347 --> 00:47:11.917
without grooves,

775
00:47:12.437 --> 00:47:14.646
but he couldn't understand it.
The problem


776
00:47:14.826 --> 00:47:16.216
was his own brain.

777
00:47:16.696 --> 00:47:19.086
He saw everything from the outside.
To understand


778
00:47:19.256 --> 00:47:21.426
those symbols, he had
to see them from the inside.


779
00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:26.466
There was only one way of
achieving it: To erase the grooves.


780
00:47:26.686 --> 00:47:28.506
The idea might seem grotesque,

781
00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:30.246
but not to a person
who has been told


782
00:47:30.426 --> 00:47:32.506
that he's suffering
from terminal cancer.


783
00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:34.156
His bones were rotting like wood

784
00:47:34.336 --> 00:47:36.066
infested with woodworm.

785
00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.196
All he had to look forward to

786
00:47:38.376 --> 00:47:41.026
was the amputation
of his limbs, one by one.


787
00:47:41.896 --> 00:47:45.456
He was euphoric, he laughed,
nervously, like someone about


788
00:47:45.676 --> 00:47:48.716
to discover something incredible
who can't contain his joy.


789
00:47:48.846 --> 00:47:49.896
It was then

790
00:47:49.926 --> 00:47:52.316
that I realized that my friend
had gone completely mad.


791
00:47:53.576 --> 00:47:55.146
He wanted to lobotomize himself.

792
00:47:55.316 --> 00:47:57.276
His only problem
was how to ensure


793
00:47:57.446 --> 00:47:59.666
that the brain damage
was not excessive.


794
00:48:00.446 --> 00:48:02.186
He had to perforate
the skull and reach


795
00:48:02.356 --> 00:48:03.836
the brain, with something like

796
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.096
a small harpoon.

797
00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:08.216
He asked for my help
and I refused,


798
00:48:08.566 --> 00:48:11.956
although I did promise I would try
to collect the messages he wrote


799
00:48:12.136 --> 00:48:13.386
from the other side.

800
00:48:13.696 --> 00:48:15.646
He used a nail gun.

801
00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:20.736
What does he write?

802
00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:23.336
The symbols are becoming
more and more illegible.


803
00:48:23.866 --> 00:48:27.636
In all this time he's never drawn
a logical symbol or a number.


804
00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:29.466
So what are they, then?

805
00:48:29.636 --> 00:48:32.856
Four letters that
he repeats over and over.


806
00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:35.506
A woman's name.

807
00:48:49.886 --> 00:48:51.496
Where were you last night?

808
00:48:51.926 --> 00:48:53.406
Beth, what are you doing here?

809
00:48:53.576 --> 00:48:55.406
I was waiting for you.

810
00:48:56.446 --> 00:48:57.836
I'm sorry. I was out and...

811
00:48:57.966 --> 00:49:00.576
I thought you felt
something for me.


812
00:49:02.526 --> 00:49:03.836
More than pity,

813
00:49:04.396 --> 00:49:05.836
but I was wrong.

814
00:49:06.396 --> 00:49:08.616
Of course I feel something
for you. We're friends.


815
00:49:08.786 --> 00:49:10.086
I want to help you, but...

816
00:49:10.216 --> 00:49:12.606
"We're friends,
you want to help me".


817
00:49:13.606 --> 00:49:15.246
That's worse than saying
"you disgust me".


818
00:49:15.516 --> 00:49:16.996
- Beth, please.
- Don't touch me!


819
00:49:20.605 --> 00:49:22.075
The kinder you try to be,

820
00:49:22.255 --> 00:49:24.125
the more humiliated I feel.

821
00:49:24.905 --> 00:49:26.645
Beth, I don't mean to humiliate you.

822
00:49:27.075 --> 00:49:31.245
Then treat me like a woman. You all
treat me like I was a little girl.


823
00:49:31.465 --> 00:49:32.555
Maybe this isn't the time for...

824
00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:34.675
Now is the fucking
perfect time for this, Martin.


825
00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:38.805
What's the matter?

826
00:49:40.155 --> 00:49:42.325
You're embarrassed to be seen
with me? Is that it?


827
00:49:42.585 --> 00:49:44.285
Don't worry.
I'm his mother.


828
00:49:44.495 --> 00:49:46.585
I'm just making sure
he does his homework.


829
00:49:46.755 --> 00:49:47.755
Be quiet!

830
00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:50.495
Beth, wait!

831
00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:02.185
Found your killer yet?

832
00:50:28.205 --> 00:50:32.025
Lorna? It's me, Martin. Do you know
anything about seldom's friend?


833
00:50:32.205 --> 00:50:34.595
Kalman?
What's wrong?


834
00:50:34.805 --> 00:50:36.675
He's been murdered.
Today, at two fifteen.


835
00:50:37.505 --> 00:50:39.155
No... wait a second.

836
00:50:51.975 --> 00:50:53.795
Sorry, Sherlock, but he's alive.

837
00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:55.055
Are you sure?

838
00:50:55.225 --> 00:50:56.835
Yes, he's right in front of me.

839
00:50:56.965 --> 00:50:59.405
If it's not him, then who?

840
00:51:01.095 --> 00:51:03.525
It would have looked like
death from natural causes,


841
00:51:03.705 --> 00:51:06.095
if we hadn't discovered
this little detail.


842
00:51:07.095 --> 00:51:08.785
It's an intravenous injection,

843
00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:11.395
and he wasn't receiving
that kind of treatment.


844
00:51:11.565 --> 00:51:12.825
What sort of poison
was administered?


845
00:51:12.995 --> 00:51:15.475
We don't know. We'll have to wait
for the post mortem report.


846
00:51:15.645 --> 00:51:17.035
We know the time of death?

847
00:51:17.215 --> 00:51:18.825
Exactly as it said on the note:

848
00:51:19.035 --> 00:51:20.555
Quarter past two.
It says so


849
00:51:20.734 --> 00:51:22.514
- on the wristband.
- Where did they find the body?


850
00:51:22.684 --> 00:51:25.204
In the ward,
before it was brought here.


851
00:51:25.594 --> 00:51:28.114
All of these people
have died in the last few hours?


852
00:51:28.294 --> 00:51:31.984
Well, it's only to be expected.
This is the terminal illnesses ward.


853
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:34.214
At least a couple
of patients die every day,


854
00:51:34.244 --> 00:51:35.804
according to
the senior nursing officer.


855
00:51:35.934 --> 00:51:38.194
He knew my movements,
which encouraged him


856
00:51:38.374 --> 00:51:39.424
to commit the crime here.

857
00:51:39.454 --> 00:51:42.764
If he had meant to harm me,
he would have killed kalman.


858
00:51:42.894 --> 00:51:43.894
Or he could have seen you

859
00:51:44.064 --> 00:51:46.194
enter the ward and didn't know
which of the two was your friend.


860
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:47.714
A terminal patient

861
00:51:47.844 --> 00:51:49.014
on the point of death.

862
00:51:49.194 --> 00:51:51.584
A murder that wouldn't have been
discovered had it not been


863
00:51:51.794 --> 00:51:54.014
- for the note.
- Another imperceptible crime.


864
00:51:55.754 --> 00:51:59.834
And might I know what
you're talking about, gentlemen?


865
00:52:00.354 --> 00:52:04.354
The second sign gives the clue as to
how the sequence should be read.


866
00:52:04.524 --> 00:52:06.484
It could be
figurative representations,


867
00:52:06.654 --> 00:52:10.474
or could be semantic or syntactic,
like geometric figures.


868
00:52:10.654 --> 00:52:12.694
Can you translate that?

869
00:52:13.564 --> 00:52:14.954
The professor means the signs

870
00:52:15.124 --> 00:52:16.824
could represent things
in the real world


871
00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:20.864
or not represent anything,
be abstract, like geometric shapes.


872
00:52:21.384 --> 00:52:23.424
The second symbol
is again astute, because,


873
00:52:23.554 --> 00:52:25.594
being so schematic,
it allows both readings.


874
00:52:26.124 --> 00:52:29.814
It could be a game of symmetry,
or it could simply be a fish.


875
00:52:30.164 --> 00:52:31.244
Soup,

876
00:52:32.284 --> 00:52:33.414
fish,

877
00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:35.984
dessert.

878
00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:38.674
Martin, show some respect

879
00:52:39.064 --> 00:52:39.894
for the inspector, please.

880
00:52:40.064 --> 00:52:42.504
No possibility deserves
to be overlooked.


881
00:52:43.194 --> 00:52:44.804
Let me propose a puzzle.

882
00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:47.364
What is the fourth

883
00:52:47.534 --> 00:52:48.794
symbol...

884
00:52:49.884 --> 00:52:51.364
In this other series?

885
00:52:57.354 --> 00:52:58.574
No idea.

886
00:52:58.744 --> 00:53:00.484
Did you miss class that day, too?

887
00:53:01.184 --> 00:53:03.484
You just have to know how to look.
The solution


888
00:53:03.654 --> 00:53:04.814
is very simple, I assure you.

889
00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:06.614
It's called the idiot series.

890
00:53:07.174 --> 00:53:08.174
Anyone who can't work it out...

891
00:53:08.304 --> 00:53:09.914
Thank you, professor.
I get the message.


892
00:53:10.914 --> 00:53:14.524
However, I incline to the idea that
the symbols relate to mathematics,


893
00:53:14.734 --> 00:53:16.084
rather than gastronomy.

894
00:53:16.304 --> 00:53:18.384
So, you think
a mathematician's involved?


895
00:53:18.564 --> 00:53:22.384
It's possible, someone who seeks
recognition of some sort,


896
00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:25.633
or someone who's not
a mathematician but wants to be.


897
00:53:25.773 --> 00:53:26.813
A student?

898
00:53:26.983 --> 00:53:27.983
That's unlikely.

899
00:53:28.113 --> 00:53:29.293
Could you take

900
00:53:29.463 --> 00:53:31.203
the second lieutenant out, Martin?

901
00:53:31.593 --> 00:53:32.553
No, I haven't taught
for a long time.


902
00:53:32.683 --> 00:53:34.723
Well, can you tell us

903
00:53:34.893 --> 00:53:37.063
what the third symbol

904
00:53:37.243 --> 00:53:38.243
will be?

905
00:53:39.323 --> 00:53:40.373
No.

906
00:53:40.763 --> 00:53:42.673
Far too many options.

907
00:53:43.193 --> 00:53:46.843
He's putting us to the test,
and I wouldn't like to slip up.


908
00:53:47.063 --> 00:53:48.883
Okay, let's see
if I've got this right.


909
00:53:50.233 --> 00:53:53.013
We are going to wait
until he kills another person


910
00:53:53.183 --> 00:53:56.533
because we can't decipher
this bloody puzzle?


911
00:53:58.443 --> 00:54:00.093
Tricky situation, isn't it?

912
00:54:01.703 --> 00:54:04.263
- Could I get those there?
- 2.60 please, sir.


913
00:54:05.963 --> 00:54:07.173
Good evening.

914
00:54:27.813 --> 00:54:28.903
Seldom!

915
00:54:29.113 --> 00:54:30.163
Martin?

916
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.853
Why are you following me?

917
00:54:32.033 --> 00:54:34.943
I'm not following anybody,
for god's sake, least of all you!


918
00:54:35.113 --> 00:54:36.543
So what are you doing here?

919
00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.023
I'm going to that restaurant.

920
00:54:38.193 --> 00:54:39.893
Do you find it so odd that
i should be going out for dinner?


921
00:54:40.063 --> 00:54:41.183
That's where I'm going, too.

922
00:54:42.063 --> 00:54:43.763
Why, that's absurd.

923
00:54:45.933 --> 00:54:47.063
I'm sorry.

924
00:54:47.233 --> 00:54:49.153
I should have told you
Arthur was coming as well.


925
00:54:49.663 --> 00:54:51.793
Excuse me, lorna,
but I'm the one who's annoyed


926
00:54:51.973 --> 00:54:54.093
by the presence at our table
of this good-for-nothing.


927
00:54:54.233 --> 00:54:55.233
Good-for-nothing?

928
00:54:56.013 --> 00:54:59.003
You couldn't see a joke if it stood
up and bit you in the arse, Martin.


929
00:54:59.143 --> 00:55:00.143
You're far too serious

930
00:55:00.273 --> 00:55:03.053
- for your age.
- He called me at the hospital and I


931
00:55:03.183 --> 00:55:04.873
just thought it would be best to
bring you up to date together, so...


932
00:55:05.043 --> 00:55:09.263
Forget it, I'm not bothered by it.
I just hope I didn't hurt you.


933
00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:11.433
Even if you had,
i wouldn't admit it.


934
00:55:11.603 --> 00:55:13.273
You're like two kids
fighting over a ball.


935
00:55:13.303 --> 00:55:15.783
- And you're the ball?
- No, I'm the nurse who's gonna spank


936
00:55:15.993 --> 00:55:16.993
your bottoms
if you don't shut up.


937
00:55:17.173 --> 00:55:18.343
Please.

938
00:55:19.773 --> 00:55:21.863
I talked with the forensic expert.

939
00:55:22.033 --> 00:55:22.863
And?

940
00:55:23.033 --> 00:55:24.033
Nothing.

941
00:55:25.423 --> 00:55:27.552
Not a trace of
any toxic substance.


942
00:55:27.722 --> 00:55:29.642
Whatever he was injected with
is totally unknown.


943
00:55:29.772 --> 00:55:30.942
Air, maybe?

944
00:55:31.112 --> 00:55:32.332
No!

945
00:55:32.502 --> 00:55:33.682
Let her speak, please.

946
00:55:33.812 --> 00:55:37.762
He's right, it's unlikely.
If he'd been injected with air,


947
00:55:37.982 --> 00:55:40.112
they would have spotted it
in the post mortem.


948
00:55:40.892 --> 00:55:43.842
However there is another
possibility. A substance


949
00:55:43.972 --> 00:55:46.232
they extract from
a poisonous mushroom: Amanita


950
00:55:46.412 --> 00:55:49.322
muscaria. But there are
no reagents that detect it.


951
00:55:49.532 --> 00:55:51.272
So it's a sort of secret among

952
00:55:51.492 --> 00:55:53.372
- forensic pathologists.
- How did you find out?


953
00:55:53.702 --> 00:55:56.312
Lorna has a knack
of finding out what she wants.


954
00:55:58.182 --> 00:55:59.932
Her house is littered
with murder mysteries,


955
00:55:59.962 --> 00:56:01.922
but I imagine
you know that by now.


956
00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.182
Yes, I do.

957
00:56:04.482 --> 00:56:06.742
What surprises me
is that you haven't managed


958
00:56:06.912 --> 00:56:08.822
to worm all the information
out of Martin.


959
00:56:10.352 --> 00:56:12.562
Martin is a good guy.
He knows he can't tell anyone


960
00:56:12.782 --> 00:56:14.172
what you or the police
have told him in confidence.


961
00:56:14.342 --> 00:56:16.212
Well, he does right
not to tell you anything.


962
00:56:16.382 --> 00:56:18.302
After all, you're still
on the list of suspects.


963
00:56:18.432 --> 00:56:19.252
Me?

964
00:56:19.432 --> 00:56:21.082
Well, don't look so surprised.

965
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.222
Both murders are closely linked
with the hospital.


966
00:56:23.252 --> 00:56:25.252
You could have gone
into the room and injected


967
00:56:25.422 --> 00:56:26.552
that substance which, curiously,

968
00:56:26.682 --> 00:56:28.852
only you and the forensic
pathologists know about.


969
00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:31.162
That's ridiculous.
She has no motive.


970
00:56:31.462 --> 00:56:35.852
Of all the vast mountains of
knowledge you have not yet scaled,


971
00:56:36.022 --> 00:56:40.022
Martin, this slope is one
of the most slippery. Be careful.


972
00:56:41.112 --> 00:56:43.192
Don't even go there, Arthur.

973
00:56:46.142 --> 00:56:47.622
Let it suffice to say

974
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:51.322
that our relationship
transcended the purely intellectual,


975
00:56:52.402 --> 00:56:53.402
and when it ended,

976
00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:56.362
she took it anything but sportingly.

977
00:56:56.532 --> 00:56:58.332
If you don't shut up
I'll kill you, I promise.


978
00:56:58.752 --> 00:56:59.872
There, you see?

979
00:57:01.312 --> 00:57:04.002
Has she or has
she not got a motive?

980
00:57:04.442 --> 00:57:06.782
You are so obnoxious.

981
00:57:07.392 --> 00:57:09.562
You enjoy playing with people.

982
00:57:15.562 --> 00:57:17.172
Now do you understand?

983
00:57:17.642 --> 00:57:19.692
Any formulation
is valid in the series,


984
00:57:19.862 --> 00:57:22.862
because we can always find
a rule that justifies it.


985
00:57:23.512 --> 00:57:26.682
Heart on a line,
now you've got the eight...


986
00:57:29.422 --> 00:57:31.071
Now you give me the fourth.

987
00:57:37.671 --> 00:57:40.371
Ah, well, well, young man.
You are certainly not a total idiot.


988
00:57:42.111 --> 00:57:45.451
One, two, three, four.

989
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:48.671
- This was easy.
- The murderer's series


990
00:57:48.841 --> 00:57:50.791
is infinitely more complex.

991
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:54.441
Tell me what the third symbol is.

992
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:57.091
Circle, fish...

993
00:57:58.221 --> 00:57:59.481
What's the third?

994
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:02.221
I'm sorry, I can't say.

995
00:58:03.351 --> 00:58:06.301
- Why not? Don't you trust me?
- I trust you


996
00:58:06.481 --> 00:58:07.881
implicitly but
that's not the point.


997
00:58:07.911 --> 00:58:09.691
If I tell you,
then you'll stop thinking.


998
00:58:10.351 --> 00:58:12.261
You might come up
with a better idea


999
00:58:12.391 --> 00:58:13.561
than mine.

1000
00:58:13.731 --> 00:58:17.601
No, there's something else. You
could have easily told the police.


1001
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:19.691
For them, anything
is better than nothing.


1002
00:58:20.341 --> 00:58:21.551
You're right.

1003
00:58:23.211 --> 00:58:24.861
But there's a good reason
why I didn't.


1004
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:26.381
I'm scared.

1005
00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:27.561
Scared?

1006
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:30.501
This whole business terrifies me.

1007
00:58:30.681 --> 00:58:32.851
We're playing
with symbols and puzzles,


1008
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:34.501
but behind it all
is the real world,


1009
00:58:34.681 --> 00:58:37.461
do you understand?
It's about people's lives.


1010
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:41.321
If we make a mistake in an equation,
we rub it out, no problem.


1011
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:43.931
But where life is concerned,

1012
00:58:44.281 --> 00:58:45.711
there's no turning back.

1013
00:58:46.671 --> 00:58:48.141
In the real world any decision,

1014
00:58:48.321 --> 00:58:51.401
however insignificant,
has irreversible consequences.


1015
00:58:51.581 --> 00:58:54.181
At least, that's
what life has taught me.


1016
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:57.961
You're very young.

1017
00:59:00.141 --> 00:59:02.961
I've already paid
a high price for my mistakes.


1018
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:18.771
Keep this.

1019
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:21.081
What is it?

1020
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:23.251
It's the third symbol of the series.

1021
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:26.591
You can do one of two things: You
can open it now and have your answer


1022
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:29.111
or you can work out
the solution yourself,


1023
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:31.681
and prove you're not an idiot.

1024
00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.660
Thank you very much.

1025
00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.180
We're finished.

1026
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:02.310
Thanks.

1027
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.870
I'm glad to see you.

1028
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.650
That was spectacular.

1029
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.270
You should see it
with the fireworks


1030
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:11.820
- and everything...
- What, here?


1031
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.280
No. It's just a rehearsal
for the guy Fawkes' day concert.


1032
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.730
Guy Fawkes?

1033
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.340
Remember, remember
the fifth of November?


1034
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.250
No, sorry, I don't remember.

1035
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:20.530
And...

1036
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.340
It'll be my last concert.

1037
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.810
I'm taking your advice
and getting out.


1038
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.940
This "marvellous" city
can be stifling.


1039
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.640
It's too dismal.

1040
01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.770
I want to go somewhere
with more light.


1041
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.290
Spain or...
Maybe south America.


1042
01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.940
Beth, I want to apologize
for what happened.


1043
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.720
It was my fault.
I needed help,


1044
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.240
a little affection, you gave it
to me and I spoiled it all.


1045
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.890
You were going through
a difficult time, I understand.


1046
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.880
You're very sweet.
So, you coming to the concert?


1047
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.230
I'll be there.

1048
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.310
Martin!

1049
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:03.790
There's something else
i need to tell you.


1050
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:07.650
I spoke with petersen and maybe
i said more than I should have.


1051
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.040
Why?

1052
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:13.000
He began to ask me
some questions about you.


1053
01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.390
Me?

1054
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:16.040
He wanted to know

1055
01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.990
why you chose
my house in particular.


1056
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.560
What did you tell him?

1057
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.130
The truth.

1058
01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.380
That you're obsessed with everything
there is to do with seldom.


1059
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:24.550
You told him what?

1060
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.120
I didn't think it was important.

1061
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:29.030
I'm sure you're not going to deny
that you're obsessed with him.


1062
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:30.370
What are you talking about?

1063
01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:33.460
He also asked me...

1064
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.929
If... there was any relationship
between the two of us.


1065
01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:40.239
- And you said...
- I told him what happened.


1066
01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:41.889
What happened?
Nothing!


1067
01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:44.149
Exactly, that's what
i told him, nothing happened.


1068
01:01:45.409 --> 01:01:48.359
Okay, okay... you'd have been better
off not saying anything at all.


1069
01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.099
I know, and...

1070
01:01:50.529 --> 01:01:53.009
As soon as I said it
i regretted it but...


1071
01:01:53.489 --> 01:01:54.789
I was angry with you and it was

1072
01:01:55.009 --> 01:01:56.529
the first thing
that came into my mind.


1073
01:01:56.699 --> 01:01:58.219
What else did you tell him, Beth?

1074
01:01:58.399 --> 01:02:00.399
I told him that I...

1075
01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:04.309
I had a feeling that
you weren't interested in me


1076
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:07.039
and that you preferred
being with seldom.


1077
01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:08.349
Oh, bloody hell!

1078
01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.739
I'm sorry.

1079
01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:15.259
You don't think they'll take
something so stupid seriously?


1080
01:02:15.429 --> 01:02:17.559
They take everything
seriously, Beth.


1081
01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:21.159
Well, I don't think it's going
to put you on the spot.


1082
01:02:21.379 --> 01:02:24.809
It's absurd that the police should
think that you're the murderer.


1083
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:29.809
Does the perfect crime exist?

1084
01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:33.329
For years, writers
have speculated on this idea


1085
01:02:33.629 --> 01:02:34.809
and murderers too.

1086
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:37.719
Some even managed to put
the idea into practice.


1087
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:40.369
Like the case
of Howard green, in London.


1088
01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:42.369
Green was a humble tailor,

1089
01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:44.969
well-considered socially.

1090
01:02:45.099 --> 01:02:48.139
He kept a diary which
the police found in his own house.


1091
01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:50.319
In the diary, he analyzed

1092
01:02:50.489 --> 01:02:51.619
in great detail

1093
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:53.269
fourteen ways of murdering

1094
01:02:53.449 --> 01:02:57.229
his wife, for whom he professed
a deep and secret


1095
01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.569
hatred. Some of

1096
01:02:58.749 --> 01:03:00.309
the procedures were ridiculous,

1097
01:03:00.479 --> 01:03:02.869
others brutal, one or two

1098
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:04.309
really brilliant.

1099
01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:06.129
But what green understood at once

1100
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:08.429
was that the main danger
for the criminal


1101
01:03:08.609 --> 01:03:12.079
was not the possible investigation
of facts in the past


1102
01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:13.469
but the problems that

1103
01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:15.389
might arise in the future.

1104
01:03:15.689 --> 01:03:19.339
Every alibi contains an element
of falsehood which with Patience


1105
01:03:19.509 --> 01:03:21.029
can be discovered.

1106
01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:25.379
His conclusion was that
the only perfect crime that exists


1107
01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:29.159
is not the one that remains
unsolved but the one


1108
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:31.849
which is solved
with the wrong culprit.


1109
01:03:32.719 --> 01:03:34.199
Does he kill her in the end?

1110
01:03:34.889 --> 01:03:37.069
No, she kills him.

1111
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:40.578
One night she found the diary.

1112
01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:42.578
She ended up stabbing him with

1113
01:03:42.758 --> 01:03:43.798
the kitchen scissors.

1114
01:03:45.098 --> 01:03:47.748
The jury, horrified
by the reading of the diary,


1115
01:03:48.018 --> 01:03:50.098
judge the murder to have been

1116
01:03:50.228 --> 01:03:52.358
in self-defence
and declare her innocent.


1117
01:03:53.398 --> 01:03:54.438
Julia green,

1118
01:03:54.618 --> 01:03:57.098
you have been found
not guilty, you are free to go.


1119
01:03:59.308 --> 01:04:01.608
I don't understand.
How is it the perfect crime?


1120
01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.348
It was discovered recently

1121
01:04:03.528 --> 01:04:06.258
that the handwriting in the diaries
was not Howard green's.


1122
01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:07.738
So, who wrote them?

1123
01:04:07.908 --> 01:04:11.298
His wife's lover,
a forger of works of art.


1124
01:04:12.078 --> 01:04:14.688
The murderer is 30/36 years old.

1125
01:04:14.858 --> 01:04:18.248
Born into a lower middle class
family, in a small town or a suburb


1126
01:04:18.428 --> 01:04:19.558
of a big city.

1127
01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:22.768
He's got the characteristics
of a precocious genius.


1128
01:04:23.288 --> 01:04:24.728
And probably

1129
01:04:24.898 --> 01:04:26.468
some form of physical defect.

1130
01:04:28.068 --> 01:04:29.768
He imagines that his talents

1131
01:04:29.898 --> 01:04:33.808
triumph and that he can destroy
those who humiliate him.


1132
01:04:33.978 --> 01:04:35.548
Then his big chance arrives:

1133
01:04:35.718 --> 01:04:39.408
To leave his environment and put
his former world behind him.


1134
01:04:39.928 --> 01:04:44.148
And it is here that something
unexpected happens: He is rejected.


1135
01:04:44.368 --> 01:04:47.748
For some, probably
unfair reason, he is expelled


1136
01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:51.268
from the place that he considers
to be his by right.


1137
01:04:51.448 --> 01:04:54.138
And he finds himself
faced with the prospect


1138
01:04:54.268 --> 01:04:56.708
of having to return to the world
that he thought he'd escaped.


1139
01:04:57.138 --> 01:05:00.478
Goodness, sounds like
this woman knew him personally.


1140
01:05:00.658 --> 01:05:03.308
That's crazy, she has no basis.

1141
01:05:03.478 --> 01:05:05.698
In any case, we're not talking
about a psychopath,


1142
01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.868
there are no elements of cruelty.

1143
01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:11.038
In fact, we could say
that he is virtually innocent.


1144
01:05:11.218 --> 01:05:15.518
Exactly. The psychologist
puts special emphasis on that.


1145
01:05:15.648 --> 01:05:16.988
The murderer is seeking

1146
01:05:17.168 --> 01:05:18.858
vengeance and admiration.

1147
01:05:19.078 --> 01:05:21.858
The murders are, in a sense,
a way of paying court to you.


1148
01:05:22.028 --> 01:05:24.638
There's a mixture
of the desire for vengeance


1149
01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:27.118
and the much stronger desire
to belong


1150
01:05:27.288 --> 01:05:30.718
to your world. He wants you
to accept him, seldom.


1151
01:05:31.418 --> 01:05:32.198
He's trying to please you,

1152
01:05:32.368 --> 01:05:35.458
as if he was in the first stages
of falling in love.


1153
01:05:35.628 --> 01:05:36.628
The psychologist

1154
01:05:36.938 --> 01:05:40.278
thinks the murderer is a repressed
homosexual who lives alone.


1155
01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:45.017
Bad cut.
You should have that seen to.


1156
01:05:45.187 --> 01:05:47.017
I don't know what the hell...

1157
01:05:47.187 --> 01:05:51.797
At least you didn't tip a pot of
boiling coffee over your trousers.


1158
01:05:51.967 --> 01:05:54.047
I'm an expert
at that, believe me.


1159
01:05:54.877 --> 01:05:57.397
If you want,
we can carry on later.


1160
01:05:58.047 --> 01:06:00.617
Yes, that might be an idea.

1161
01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:03.957
Don't you think
you're exaggerating a bit?


1162
01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.607
The police are open
to all sorts of hypotheses.


1163
01:06:06.777 --> 01:06:09.127
Right now any formulation
can be valid for them.


1164
01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:10.477
You sound like seldom.

1165
01:06:10.607 --> 01:06:13.557
He's right, for god's sakes.
I could be a suspect, too!


1166
01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.127
Yeah, like me.

1167
01:06:15.557 --> 01:06:17.297
Yes, like you, like everyone.

1168
01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:22.687
Don't let seldom
get into your head, baby.


1169
01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:25.987
Cuz once he's in there,
there's no way of getting him out.


1170
01:06:26.157 --> 01:06:29.937
That's what happened to you, isn't
it? You're still in love with him.


1171
01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:31.847
That's not funny.

1172
01:06:33.847 --> 01:06:34.937
Sorry.

1173
01:06:35.677 --> 01:06:38.327
It's as if seldom was everywhere,
it's a nightmare.


1174
01:06:38.497 --> 01:06:40.617
There's nothing I've done
that he hasn't done already,


1175
01:06:40.757 --> 01:06:41.977
and apparently much better

1176
01:06:42.187 --> 01:06:42.887
than me.

1177
01:06:43.017 --> 01:06:44.547
What do you want me to do?
To tell you


1178
01:06:44.577 --> 01:06:46.187
I prefer you and you fuck
better than he did?


1179
01:06:46.357 --> 01:06:49.357
No. I want you to lie
and tell me I'm more intelligent.


1180
01:06:52.787 --> 01:06:53.917
Go to hell.

1181
01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.487
You know what pissed me off?

1182
01:06:55.657 --> 01:06:56.967
What pissed me off was knowing

1183
01:06:57.137 --> 01:06:59.377
that I wasn't the only one
at the table who'd fucked you.


1184
01:07:01.527 --> 01:07:03.127
That was so long ago.

1185
01:07:03.957 --> 01:07:05.957
When you were thirteen, right?
He calls you


1186
01:07:06.127 --> 01:07:07.777
and you go running
like a little lapdog,


1187
01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.167
and all so he can
give you another kick.


1188
01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.037
Yeah, that's how I am.

1189
01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:15.127
Exactly like you.

1190
01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:18.337
Martin, I think
you'd better go now, really.


1191
01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.637
And until all this is over,

1192
01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:23.947
I really don't want to know
anything about you or seldom.


1193
01:07:25.987 --> 01:07:28.117
You are a shit
like the rest of us.


1194
01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.807
We are mediocre,

1195
01:07:30.197 --> 01:07:32.157
and all mediocre people can do is...

1196
01:07:33.107 --> 01:07:34.457
Get drunk and forget.

1197
01:07:36.107 --> 01:07:37.237
Leave me alone.

1198
01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:47.486
To the mediocre of this world!

1199
01:07:48.876 --> 01:07:51.006
To vulgarity

1200
01:07:51.186 --> 01:07:52.316
and stupidity!

1201
01:07:53.186 --> 01:07:55.266
Cambridge has kicked us
in the arse again!


1202
01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.096
What?

1203
01:07:59.216 --> 01:08:00.216
What are you looking at?

1204
01:08:02.956 --> 01:08:04.346
It's true, isn't it?

1205
01:08:04.736 --> 01:08:07.256
You should give up maths
and write children's stories


1206
01:08:07.606 --> 01:08:08.606
- instead!
- Calm down.


1207
01:08:08.826 --> 01:08:10.646
- Let's get out of here.
- One day


1208
01:08:10.826 --> 01:08:13.776
the mad hatter will come
out of his closet and assfuck


1209
01:08:13.946 --> 01:08:15.996
- the lot of you!
- Okay, come on.


1210
01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:21.686
What are you talking about?

1211
01:08:21.856 --> 01:08:23.896
What planet are you from,
bloody fool?


1212
01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:25.766
If you'd stopped
fucking everyone in sight


1213
01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:28.896
and paid a bit of attention,
you'd have realized.


1214
01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:33.896
Henry Wilkins?
Who's Henry Wilkins?


1215
01:08:34.156 --> 01:08:36.456
He's Kennedy's assassin,
who do you think?


1216
01:08:37.106 --> 01:08:39.106
He's solved bormat's last theorem?

1217
01:08:39.756 --> 01:08:42.406
At least that is the rumour.
He's giving


1218
01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:44.106
a demonstration
in the next three days,


1219
01:08:44.276 --> 01:08:46.276
in the theory of numbers
conference at Cambridge.


1220
01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:48.406
He's solved
the most fucking difficult


1221
01:08:48.576 --> 01:08:50.926
mathematics problem
of the last 300 years.


1222
01:08:51.096 --> 01:08:54.186
And you know who should be there,
giving this demonstration?


1223
01:08:54.786 --> 01:08:59.006
Me!
Yuri Ivanovich podorov!


1224
01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.136
You have a demonstration
of bormat's last theorem?


1225
01:09:01.266 --> 01:09:02.696
No, of course I don't!

1226
01:09:02.996 --> 01:09:06.306
But I would have it, if your friend
seldom had not stolen it from me.


1227
01:09:06.436 --> 01:09:07.736
Ah, so that's it...

1228
01:09:07.906 --> 01:09:10.776
It was me who deduced
that the bormat conjecture


1229
01:09:10.956 --> 01:09:13.556
could not be solved without
taniyama's formulation.


1230
01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.076
For every modular form,
there is an elliptic curve,


1231
01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:18.556
and for every elliptic curve
there is a modular form.


1232
01:09:18.686 --> 01:09:19.746
You're drunk.

1233
01:09:19.776 --> 01:09:22.686
Yes, I'm drunk!
But eight years ago I was not!


1234
01:09:23.856 --> 01:09:25.506
I went to seldom,

1235
01:09:25.676 --> 01:09:27.466
explained to him,
asked him to help me


1236
01:09:27.636 --> 01:09:29.716
get into the theory
of numbers group at Cambridge,


1237
01:09:29.856 --> 01:09:32.976
and, do you know what
he said about my idea?


1238
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.846
"It's absurd."

1239
01:09:35.626 --> 01:09:37.456
"It's absurd"!

1240
01:09:38.366 --> 01:09:41.626
And now, thanks to this
little bit of absurdity,


1241
01:09:42.366 --> 01:09:43.706
Henry Wilkins

1242
01:09:44.626 --> 01:09:46.356
will go down in history.

1243
01:09:47.146 --> 01:09:48.746
Apparently, he's been working

1244
01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:51.185
on bormat in secret

1245
01:09:51.315 --> 01:09:53.745
- for seven years.
- Why in secret?


1246
01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:55.785
What do you mean why?

1247
01:09:55.965 --> 01:09:58.695
Because they stole it from me!
It was my idea!


1248
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.085
But I tell you something:
They don't know how to do it.


1249
01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:03.655
There's a mistake in their approach.
They don't know how to do it.


1250
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.215
But it hasn't been proved yet.

1251
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:07.645
Don't contradict me.

1252
01:10:08.385 --> 01:10:10.385
You're on their side, aren't you?

1253
01:10:10.695 --> 01:10:13.995
You are all against me!
You are trying to steal my ideas!


1254
01:10:14.165 --> 01:10:15.775
You won't read my mind!

1255
01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:18.075
Help me! I'm being robbed!
Help me!


1256
01:10:18.245 --> 01:10:19.645
They're trying to kill me!

1257
01:10:19.855 --> 01:10:22.115
If you don't shut up,
i fucking will kill you!


1258
01:10:25.595 --> 01:10:26.725
Easy, easy.

1259
01:10:28.065 --> 01:10:29.115
Bastards!

1260
01:10:30.805 --> 01:10:33.455
Fucking English and
their damned good manners.


1261
01:10:33.765 --> 01:10:34.975
When they fuck you,

1262
01:10:36.235 --> 01:10:38.195
they really fuck you.

1263
01:11:14.345 --> 01:11:15.995
Welcome to the party.

1264
01:11:17.725 --> 01:11:20.725
I gather nobody told you
about the dress code for this do?


1265
01:11:26.935 --> 01:11:29.675
Good old guy Fawkes
was ahead of his time.


1266
01:11:29.855 --> 01:11:31.375
He tried to blow up parliament

1267
01:11:31.585 --> 01:11:34.105
with the king, the lords and
the whole bloody government inside.


1268
01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:38.105
Since then, every November 6th,
we've had this civilized celebration


1269
01:11:38.275 --> 01:11:40.495
where we burn his image,

1270
01:11:41.585 --> 01:11:43.885
although nowadays
I'd be hard pushed to tell you


1271
01:11:44.055 --> 01:11:46.885
whether it's to commemorate
his failure or his brilliant idea.


1272
01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.875
Talking of conspirators...

1273
01:11:51.275 --> 01:11:53.314
No, don't look now, be discreet.

1274
01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.914
Sitting behind me,

1275
01:11:56.094 --> 01:11:58.614
a few rows back, is a tall black
gentleman. Do you remember him?


1276
01:12:02.524 --> 01:12:03.604
Yes.

1277
01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:06.444
He's been following me for 3 days
now. He's one of petersen's men.


1278
01:12:06.474 --> 01:12:07.644
Is petersen here as well?

1279
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:08.834
Sitting to our right,

1280
01:12:08.864 --> 01:12:10.514
just there, with his daughter.

1281
01:12:13.254 --> 01:12:14.684
There's something
i need to speak to you about.


1282
01:12:14.904 --> 01:12:15.904
It might be...

1283
01:12:36.364 --> 01:12:37.754
- Did you see him?
- Who?


1284
01:12:37.934 --> 01:12:38.934
Podorov.

1285
01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:40.454
He had something under his cape.

1286
01:13:06.734 --> 01:13:08.774
We're following a suspect
inside the palace.


1287
01:13:08.954 --> 01:13:12.034
I want all available men
inside here, now.


1288
01:13:16.164 --> 01:13:17.164
Podorov!

1289
01:13:22.074 --> 01:13:23.374
He's going up to the roof!

1290
01:13:23.554 --> 01:13:26.244
What are you doing here?
Who's with seldom?


1291
01:14:05.213 --> 01:14:06.563
- I only want...
- Shut up


1292
01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.043
and stay on the ground.

1293
01:14:08.213 --> 01:14:10.173
What the hell's this?

1294
01:14:11.643 --> 01:14:12.733
Martin, you traitor.

1295
01:14:15.683 --> 01:14:16.703
"Bastards".

1296
01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:17.943
This guy's just a fucking

1297
01:14:18.123 --> 01:14:19.333
clown.

1298
01:14:19.513 --> 01:14:22.203
Scott, what the hell are you
doing here? Get back on seldom!


1299
01:14:22.463 --> 01:14:23.463
I'm on to it.

1300
01:15:04.043 --> 01:15:05.523
Let me through, please.
I'm a doctor.


1301
01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:09.383
You okay?

1302
01:15:14.033 --> 01:15:15.203
This man is dead.

1303
01:15:21.773 --> 01:15:23.853
Seems the cause
of death was asphyxia.


1304
01:15:24.023 --> 01:15:26.333
How could they have choked him,
up there, in front of everyone?


1305
01:15:26.503 --> 01:15:28.543
According to the doctor
who attended to him,


1306
01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:30.373
it was a spontaneous
respiratory arrest.


1307
01:15:30.543 --> 01:15:32.113
I've just spoken to Beth.

1308
01:15:32.283 --> 01:15:34.643
Apparently, the man's state
of health was somewhat delicate.


1309
01:15:34.673 --> 01:15:37.803
He was operated on a few years ago
for pulmonary emphysema.


1310
01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:40.273
By rights he should
have died some time ago.


1311
01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.663
With that problem,
if your breathing is obstructed,


1312
01:15:43.883 --> 01:15:45.363
you'd be dead
in a matter of seconds.


1313
01:15:46.053 --> 01:15:48.353
We have no evidence to indicate
that this was a murder.


1314
01:15:48.533 --> 01:15:49.883
Yes, we do.

1315
01:15:56.443 --> 01:15:58.043
The third symbol is a triangle!

1316
01:15:58.223 --> 01:15:59.222
Where did you find this?

1317
01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:03.082
It was found on the conductor's
music stand. The assassin


1318
01:16:03.262 --> 01:16:05.522
tore the words
"the third in the series"


1319
01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:06.822
from the program notes.

1320
01:16:06.992 --> 01:16:09.042
The circle, the fish,

1321
01:16:09.902 --> 01:16:11.952
and the triangle.
Well, it makes sense.


1322
01:16:13.032 --> 01:16:14.812
I've had enough of this.

1323
01:16:15.332 --> 01:16:17.772
I want you to tell me right now
exactly what you know.


1324
01:16:17.942 --> 01:16:19.292
Otherwise, I'm gonna have

1325
01:16:19.552 --> 01:16:21.032
to consider you
to be an accomplice, because


1326
01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:23.122
it's obvious that
you're withholding information.


1327
01:16:24.152 --> 01:16:27.112
I only have a rudimentary idea
of what his reasoning might be.


1328
01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:28.282
So what is it,

1329
01:16:28.462 --> 01:16:29.502
for Christ's sake?

1330
01:16:30.762 --> 01:16:33.062
Well, I think maybe this is

1331
01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.282
not the best time.

1332
01:16:35.492 --> 01:16:36.762
I don't believe it.

1333
01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:38.712
Fine, fine.
I'll get out here.


1334
01:16:39.842 --> 01:16:41.802
- Do you mind, Martin?
- No, don't worry about me.


1335
01:16:41.922 --> 01:16:42.922
I could use a walk.

1336
01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.792
Just don't walk
too far, all right?


1337
01:16:51.352 --> 01:16:52.402
Bastards.

1338
01:16:54.312 --> 01:16:56.132
In Cambridge preparations
are being made


1339
01:16:56.352 --> 01:16:58.962
to celebrate one of the crowning
moments in its history.


1340
01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:03.872
If the rumours are true, thanks to
professor Henry Wilkins, bormat's


1341
01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:08.212
famous last theorem could cease to
be unsolvable in the next few hours.


1342
01:17:08.382 --> 01:17:11.082
Hundreds of mathematicians
from all over the world


1343
01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:13.292
will meet today
in Cambridge to witness,


1344
01:17:13.472 --> 01:17:14.812
live, the public demonstration

1345
01:17:14.992 --> 01:17:16.732
that professor Wilkins will give

1346
01:17:16.862 --> 01:17:19.812
in the university's
number theory congress.


1347
01:17:19.942 --> 01:17:21.372
For centuries mathematicians

1348
01:17:21.552 --> 01:17:23.892
have tried in vain
to answer that theorem.


1349
01:17:24.022 --> 01:17:25.982
Will the mystery be resolved?

1350
01:17:30.022 --> 01:17:33.932
I'm sorry about yesterday,
but I still think that you should...


1351
01:17:34.062 --> 01:17:36.582
Yeah, that I should think
for myself.


1352
01:17:37.362 --> 01:17:39.402
Though I haven't been
too successful so far.


1353
01:17:40.672 --> 01:17:44.142
Tomorrow the paper will publish
an article about the murders.


1354
01:17:44.272 --> 01:17:45.882
In it I explain everything I know.

1355
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:47.662
Everything?

1356
01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:50.922
The police think that
if we make it public


1357
01:17:51.092 --> 01:17:53.962
and we give our solution to the 4th
symbol, it'll stop the murderer.


1358
01:17:54.392 --> 01:17:56.092
What interests him is that

1359
01:17:56.262 --> 01:17:58.612
I recognize his intelligence.
That should be enough.


1360
01:17:59.302 --> 01:18:00.522
Do you think it will work?

1361
01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:02.951
It's the best
i could come up with.


1362
01:18:03.691 --> 01:18:06.261
So I have 12 hours
to prove I'm not an idiot.


1363
01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:07.991
That just about sums it up, right?

1364
01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:11.381
You're not an idiot,
much as you might try.


1365
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.251
You know it, Martin,
you just have to remember.


1366
01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:16.201
After all, you belong to the sect.

1367
01:18:25.331 --> 01:18:27.891
- I know what you're thinking.
- So?


1368
01:18:28.021 --> 01:18:30.261
It could be the biggest mistake
of your life, believe me.


1369
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:31.541
I don't believe you.

1370
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:32.801
I think you're lying.

1371
01:18:32.981 --> 01:18:35.671
You're right.
I am lying,


1372
01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:39.231
but if I distract you long enough,
maybe the bus'll set off and it'll


1373
01:18:39.401 --> 01:18:40.581
be too late.

1374
01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.500
You know, these are a bit
hard to swallow at first,


1375
01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.670
but after a while
you get a taste for them.


1376
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:31.930
My spaghetti
or my mystery novels?


1377
01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.800
No, spaghetti
is a great invention.


1378
01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:35.760
So are mystery novels.

1379
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.190
You know, they make sense.

1380
01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.800
There's something to find out and
they explain it to you at the end.


1381
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.720
In life, nobody
bothers explaining anything.


1382
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.750
I don't want to speak
of explanations,


1383
01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.880
or conjectures, or anything else.

1384
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:50.750
Outside this room nothing exists.

1385
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.790
Only you, me

1386
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.260
and this spaghetti.

1387
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.610
I know what it meant
for you to get off that bus.


1388
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.080
It was worth it.

1389
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:05.950
It's only just begun.

1390
01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:10.640
Look what you've done.
You're mad.


1391
01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.990
Mad about you.

1392
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.020
You've got some there.

1393
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:30.630
This moment is perfect...

1394
01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.630
Unique.

1395
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:35.580
"The unshaken heart
of well-rounded truth".


1396
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.450
Come again?

1397
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:43.400
It's from parmenides,
he was a Greek stand-up comedian.


1398
01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:46.270
He said that reality
is one big lie,


1399
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.270
and the only thing that exists

1400
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.830
is a single unchanging god.

1401
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.920
Wow, you're doing it again.

1402
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:55.150
What?

1403
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.740
Talking like
the people from your sect.


1404
01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.440
- Well, I guess we can't help it.
- I guess.


1405
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.040
Now I understand

1406
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.870
why girls go out with musicians
and not mathematicians.


1407
01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.260
That's what he said.

1408
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:10.249
Really? He knew
girls prefer musicians?


1409
01:22:10.429 --> 01:22:13.469
No, no, no, no.
The thing about the sect.


1410
01:22:13.689 --> 01:22:15.769
"You should know.
You're part of the sect."


1411
01:22:16.419 --> 01:22:18.119
- What?
- Fuck.


1412
01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:20.419
No, no, no.
It can't be, it's too easy.


1413
01:22:20.589 --> 01:22:21.589
What's wrong?

1414
01:22:21.939 --> 01:22:23.979
I have to discover it before
it comes out in the papers.


1415
01:22:24.109 --> 01:22:25.239
What?

1416
01:22:26.239 --> 01:22:27.069
Oh my god, it's seldom.

1417
01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:28.889
You just have to go along
with his bloody game, don't you?


1418
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.979
Yes, I do! It's all
i can fucking think about.


1419
01:22:31.109 --> 01:22:32.929
- Beth was right.
- What?


1420
01:22:33.109 --> 01:22:35.099
You're in love with
a bloody lunatic. That old man


1421
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:37.319
- turns you on more than I do!
- Look, lorna, listen to me.


1422
01:22:37.489 --> 01:22:39.539
Just this once, that's all I ask.

1423
01:22:39.839 --> 01:22:41.709
When this nightmare's over,
we're getting out


1424
01:22:41.879 --> 01:22:43.709
- of here.
- Where to?


1425
01:22:43.969 --> 01:22:46.309
Wherever. Outside these walls,
to a place with no books,


1426
01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:48.279
where people don't know
their two times tables.


1427
01:22:55.999 --> 01:22:58.129
- Shit!
- I told you.


1428
01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:01.259
It's too early,
even for the bookworms.


1429
01:23:02.039 --> 01:23:03.349
What now?

1430
01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:05.129
Bookstore!

1431
01:23:11.859 --> 01:23:13.989
- Hey, we're closed.
- We'll just be a moment!


1432
01:23:18.679 --> 01:23:20.459
At least tell me
what we're looking for.


1433
01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:23.809
Ah, here it is.

1434
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:26.159
The sect of the pythagoreans...

1435
01:23:26.329 --> 01:23:27.679
The fathers of mathematics.

1436
01:23:27.939 --> 01:23:29.849
They were forbidden
to reveal their secrets.


1437
01:23:30.059 --> 01:23:32.579
They functioned like
a religious sect, numbers


1438
01:23:32.759 --> 01:23:34.759
were sacred to them,
gods that conformed the world.


1439
01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:37.229
No, it's not here.

1440
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:41.139
I'm sorry but you'll have
to come back later.


1441
01:23:41.269 --> 01:23:42.189
There's no one on the cash register.

1442
01:23:42.319 --> 01:23:44.139
Don't worry.
We don't need to buy anything.


1443
01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.579
Well, I think
you'd better leave, then.


1444
01:23:45.789 --> 01:23:48.529
Oh, give us a moment.
Pretty please? Please.


1445
01:23:48.829 --> 01:23:50.179
If you consult our catalogue,

1446
01:23:50.349 --> 01:23:52.589
I think you'll find everything
to meet your requirements.


1447
01:23:53.139 --> 01:23:55.259
Will you shut up for a minute!
I can't think!


1448
01:23:55.869 --> 01:23:56.569
I'm sorry,

1449
01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.779
but you give me no option
but to call security.


1450
01:23:58.959 --> 01:24:00.259
Fine, call security.

1451
01:24:00.479 --> 01:24:01.479
Just leave.

1452
01:24:04.819 --> 01:24:07.039
It's got to be mentioned
in one of these,


1453
01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:08.819
a diagram, or something.

1454
01:24:16.378 --> 01:24:17.468
Kind of like that?

1455
01:24:17.988 --> 01:24:19.548
That's it. Perfect.

1456
01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:21.088
One,

1457
01:24:21.118 --> 01:24:24.158
the beginning of all things.
Perfection, enclosed in itself.


1458
01:24:24.328 --> 01:24:25.028
The fish.

1459
01:24:25.288 --> 01:24:28.108
That's what we thought. The vesica
piscis, a Christian symbol, but


1460
01:24:28.238 --> 01:24:29.238
this one's much earlier.

1461
01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:32.888
It's simply two, the intersection
of two circles. Symbol of opposites,


1462
01:24:33.058 --> 01:24:35.498
duality, the war
between good and evil.


1463
01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:36.838
Three, the triad,

1464
01:24:37.018 --> 01:24:39.488
the synthesis of opposites.
Peace after war.


1465
01:24:41.058 --> 01:24:42.228
And the fourth symbol?

1466
01:24:42.748 --> 01:24:45.658
The tetraktys, the quaternary.

1467
01:24:45.838 --> 01:24:48.878
One plus two, plus three,
plus four: Ten.


1468
01:24:49.228 --> 01:24:50.658
Totality, the demiurge.

1469
01:24:51.008 --> 01:24:53.348
It was their divine number.

1470
01:24:56.218 --> 01:24:58.608
One, two, three, four.

1471
01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:00.298
That simple.

1472
01:25:00.738 --> 01:25:02.258
How could I not see it?

1473
01:25:03.948 --> 01:25:06.208
Any enigma is easy
once you know the answer.


1474
01:25:07.778 --> 01:25:08.778
What are you looking for?

1475
01:25:08.948 --> 01:25:12.988
The only thing I know about these
guys is that they had a unique...


1476
01:25:13.428 --> 01:25:16.468
Understanding of medicine.
You know, if...


1477
01:25:16.808 --> 01:25:18.808
Intelligence was
the supreme value,


1478
01:25:18.938 --> 01:25:22.718
then the mentally retarded
were the greatest sinners.


1479
01:25:22.898 --> 01:25:25.158
They used them as Guinea pigs

1480
01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:26.498
for medical experiments.

1481
01:25:28.848 --> 01:25:31.148
They even tried organ transplants...

1482
01:25:57.088 --> 01:25:58.348
Oh shit.

1483
01:26:15.207 --> 01:26:17.857
Thanks very much,
that's all I need!


1484
01:26:19.067 --> 01:26:20.457
- Thank you.
- Really sorry.


1485
01:26:20.637 --> 01:26:21.717
Come on!

1486
01:26:23.027 --> 01:26:24.027
Hey!

1487
01:26:24.237 --> 01:26:25.237
Come here!

1488
01:26:25.627 --> 01:26:26.807
Come back here!

1489
01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:28.147
You two!

1490
01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:30.367
Where do you think
you're going? Come here!


1491
01:26:31.927 --> 01:26:33.107
I know who the murderer is.

1492
01:26:33.237 --> 01:26:35.757
It's okay, John.
Really?


1493
01:26:35.977 --> 01:26:37.537
Look, I know I fucked up
in the concert,


1494
01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:38.707
but now you have to believe me.

1495
01:26:38.887 --> 01:26:41.567
This time it could be worse, he
could kill more people, probably 10.


1496
01:26:41.707 --> 01:26:42.767
Relax.

1497
01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:46.707
This time he got in touch with us
directly. We guessed the symbol.


1498
01:26:47.617 --> 01:26:48.357
The tetraktys...

1499
01:26:48.487 --> 01:26:51.007
Exactly. The message
indicates a particular place.


1500
01:26:51.177 --> 01:26:52.397
He told us to send ambulances there.

1501
01:26:52.527 --> 01:26:53.537
A road?

1502
01:26:53.567 --> 01:26:55.607
The a421. Just past
the black cat roundabout.


1503
01:26:55.737 --> 01:26:57.257
That's the road to Cambridge.

1504
01:26:58.257 --> 01:26:59.617
There's a flyover
on the main road.


1505
01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.387
Petersen's already on his way.

1506
01:27:01.567 --> 01:27:03.737
He'll try to stop the bus
before it reaches that spot.


1507
01:27:09.117 --> 01:27:10.687
Have you located the bus yet?

1508
01:27:10.857 --> 01:27:12.507
It's three miles from where

1509
01:27:12.687 --> 01:27:14.247
you are, sir.
You'll be meeting up


1510
01:27:14.417 --> 01:27:15.547
in under a minute.

1511
01:27:17.547 --> 01:27:18.807
Petersen here, to all units.

1512
01:27:18.987 --> 01:27:21.117
The murderer may be travelling

1513
01:27:21.287 --> 01:27:24.457
with them, so keep your heads
down until I give the word.


1514
01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:50.487
Where are they?
I can't see them.


1515
01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:54.087
- Right in front of you, sir.
- Got it!


1516
01:27:55.127 --> 01:27:55.917
Now!

1517
01:27:56.087 --> 01:27:57.087
Now!

1518
01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.037
Jesus!

1519
01:28:23.066 --> 01:28:25.676
Turn off the engine!
Put your hands on the wheel!


1520
01:28:28.366 --> 01:28:29.366
We made it in time.

1521
01:28:30.066 --> 01:28:31.366
They've stopped the bus.

1522
01:28:31.536 --> 01:28:33.146
Seldom and the other
mathematicians are safe.


1523
01:28:33.276 --> 01:28:36.536
Seldom? What have you done?
You've got the wrong bus!


1524
01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:03.316
Hello?

1525
01:29:03.346 --> 01:29:06.386
Seldom, you have to speak with
petersen, there's another bus!


1526
01:29:06.556 --> 01:29:07.646
What are you talking about?

1527
01:29:07.816 --> 01:29:09.126
It's the girl's father!

1528
01:29:09.296 --> 01:29:10.516
What girl?

1529
01:29:18.026 --> 01:29:19.116
Martin?

1530
01:29:19.986 --> 01:29:21.196
Martin, can you hear me?

1531
01:29:21.376 --> 01:29:24.236
The girl in the hospital,
she needs a transplant.


1532
01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:26.846
He wants to kill
the kids to save her!


1533
01:29:43.136 --> 01:29:44.136
Sir?

1534
01:29:44.316 --> 01:29:47.046
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, this way, please.


1535
01:29:47.706 --> 01:29:49.616
- That bus has to be stopped!
- Calm down, sir.


1536
01:29:49.786 --> 01:29:51.946
They're going to be killed!
I have to talk to petersen!


1537
01:29:52.746 --> 01:29:55.606
Sir, one of the professors
insists on speaking to you.


1538
01:29:55.736 --> 01:29:57.296
He's completely
lost control of himself.


1539
01:30:14.896 --> 01:30:16.596
Oh what the hell?

1540
01:30:31.535 --> 01:30:34.715
You.
Did you know about this?


1541
01:30:35.275 --> 01:30:37.835
Did you fucking know about this?

1542
01:30:38.015 --> 01:30:39.575
You and your fucking equations!

1543
01:30:51.305 --> 01:30:52.785
I don't know anything.

1544
01:30:58.735 --> 01:30:59.905
Nothing.

1545
01:31:49.705 --> 01:31:52.825
Five of the victims
are possible donors.


1546
01:31:54.085 --> 01:31:56.395
Five organs offer a fair chance.

1547
01:31:56.825 --> 01:31:58.385
They're rushing them off
to st Joseph's.


1548
01:31:58.565 --> 01:32:00.085
That's why he sent the ambulances.

1549
01:32:00.255 --> 01:32:01.775
That's right.

1550
01:32:02.955 --> 01:32:04.775
The petrol tank
was down to a minimum.


1551
01:32:04.945 --> 01:32:06.515
He wanted to cause
as little harm as possible,


1552
01:32:06.685 --> 01:32:09.595
only this time
it wasn't exactly imperceptible.


1553
01:32:10.685 --> 01:32:12.375
Why all these?
Why all the symbols?


1554
01:32:12.815 --> 01:32:14.985
He didn't plan
to die in the accident.


1555
01:32:15.115 --> 01:32:18.155
His idea was to jump in time
to avoid being a suspect.


1556
01:32:18.335 --> 01:32:19.335
How do you know?

1557
01:32:20.675 --> 01:32:23.545
When the bus crashed,
the doors were already open.


1558
01:32:24.894 --> 01:32:26.364
And what about the other deaths?

1559
01:32:27.064 --> 01:32:28.934
Well, if only the children
had been killed,


1560
01:32:29.104 --> 01:32:30.714
he would have been
the prime suspect.


1561
01:32:30.884 --> 01:32:32.664
Making us believe
in a serial killer


1562
01:32:32.844 --> 01:32:34.274
took the spotlight off him.

1563
01:32:34.404 --> 01:32:37.404
Only he miscalculated
and didn't get out in time.


1564
01:32:38.314 --> 01:32:40.884
So, he didn't really want
to kill the other people,


1565
01:32:41.274 --> 01:32:44.004
- he just needed an alibi?
- Exactly.


1566
01:32:44.874 --> 01:32:47.484
Shame we didn't work it out sooner.

1567
01:32:47.834 --> 01:32:48.874
So much

1568
01:32:49.044 --> 01:32:50.174
for logic.

1569
01:33:37.494 --> 01:33:39.884
You were just a pawn in his game.

1570
01:33:41.144 --> 01:33:43.354
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.


1571
01:33:52.784 --> 01:33:55.304
You don't know what you're saying.

1572
01:34:17.244 --> 01:34:19.204
You don't need to get on a plane.

1573
01:34:20.244 --> 01:34:21.324
Sorry?

1574
01:34:21.504 --> 01:34:24.934
I said, you don't need to get on
a plane. You're already miles away.


1575
01:34:25.544 --> 01:34:26.674
I was just thinking...

1576
01:34:26.844 --> 01:34:27.844
Really?

1577
01:34:32.323 --> 01:34:34.193
Ok.
From now on,


1578
01:34:34.363 --> 01:34:36.103
we are just two tourists

1579
01:34:36.273 --> 01:34:39.533
in an airport with the heaviest
rucksack I've ever seen.


1580
01:34:41.183 --> 01:34:42.573
What did you pack in here anyway?

1581
01:34:42.793 --> 01:34:45.573
Oh, you know, just the essentials.
A double bed, a cooker,


1582
01:34:45.743 --> 01:34:47.173
for making spaghetti

1583
01:34:47.353 --> 01:34:49.003
- and a couple of other things.
- Well, I hope


1584
01:34:49.173 --> 01:34:50.833
you didn't pack a single
one of your mystery novels.


1585
01:34:51.003 --> 01:34:51.693
Of course not!

1586
01:34:51.873 --> 01:34:54.743
No mystery novels,
no symbols, no Oxford.


1587
01:34:54.913 --> 01:34:56.653
We had a deal, remember?

1588
01:34:56.913 --> 01:34:58.433
You gonna be able to live like this?

1589
01:34:59.473 --> 01:35:00.603
Yes.

1590
01:35:00.773 --> 01:35:01.863
Just you and me.

1591
01:35:07.463 --> 01:35:08.463
Come on.

1592
01:35:17.243 --> 01:35:18.373
Thank you.

1593
01:35:27.413 --> 01:35:29.153
Can I have your
boarding pass, please?


1594
01:35:29.363 --> 01:35:30.583
He didn't know!

1595
01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:31.933
Martin?

1596
01:35:33.273 --> 01:35:34.353
That old fucker tricked me!

1597
01:35:35.973 --> 01:35:37.573
He didn't know
what the third symbol was!


1598
01:35:46.613 --> 01:35:47.743
My god!

1599
01:35:48.443 --> 01:35:50.093
You've got the pictures with you?

1600
01:35:51.523 --> 01:35:52.873
What is this?

1601
01:35:54.263 --> 01:35:55.263
"Kreis".

1602
01:35:58.693 --> 01:36:00.043
What is that?

1603
01:36:09.643 --> 01:36:12.643
She spent 3 years
deciphering German codes.


1604
01:36:12.813 --> 01:36:13.763
Excuse me, sir,
you can't do that here.


1605
01:36:13.943 --> 01:36:14.943
Of course!

1606
01:36:15.073 --> 01:36:17.333
Kreis is German for circle.

1607
01:36:17.763 --> 01:36:19.243
He came up with it on the spot!

1608
01:36:58.562 --> 01:36:59.912
Have you been here before?

1609
01:37:02.032 --> 01:37:03.562
I never had a chance.

1610
01:37:05.422 --> 01:37:08.812
It would be a pity to leave the
country without seeing this place.


1611
01:37:10.642 --> 01:37:11.812
This is the largest

1612
01:37:11.982 --> 01:37:14.202
collection of fakes in the world.

1613
01:37:14.462 --> 01:37:16.152
Not even Michelangelo

1614
01:37:16.332 --> 01:37:18.682
can distinguish
this David from his original.


1615
01:37:20.242 --> 01:37:23.542
Trajan's column
we believe to be in Rome,


1616
01:37:24.542 --> 01:37:29.062
but we are sure
that this is a common


1617
01:37:29.282 --> 01:37:31.322
plaster copy.

1618
01:37:32.402 --> 01:37:34.052
I feel at ease here.

1619
01:37:34.662 --> 01:37:36.792
No one tries to deceive me.

1620
01:37:37.442 --> 01:37:39.312
In effect, Martin,
this is the place


1621
01:37:39.492 --> 01:37:42.482
that contains the most truth
in the entire planet.


1622
01:37:43.662 --> 01:37:46.832
We have an absolute truth:

1623
01:37:48.002 --> 01:37:50.352
Everything is fake.

1624
01:37:51.612 --> 01:37:53.432
Outside of these walls

1625
01:37:53.612 --> 01:37:55.652
nobody is sure of anything.

1626
01:37:58.602 --> 01:38:02.082
You took a big risk in giving me
a blank piece of paper.


1627
01:38:05.732 --> 01:38:09.032
That was important.
I had to convince you that I knew


1628
01:38:09.202 --> 01:38:12.112
what the sign was when, at
that moment, I wasn't at all sure.


1629
01:38:12.682 --> 01:38:14.722
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, Martin.


1630
01:38:14.892 --> 01:38:17.412
Your pride wouldn't let you open
this piece of paper


1631
01:38:17.592 --> 01:38:19.042
until you had
a solution of your own,


1632
01:38:19.072 --> 01:38:22.892
and that, if I might say,
was going to take some time.


1633
01:38:23.542 --> 01:38:25.322
There was no serial killer.

1634
01:38:26.062 --> 01:38:28.802
It was an invention,
just like petersen said.


1635
01:38:29.322 --> 01:38:31.532
But it wasn't
the bus driver's invention.


1636
01:38:31.882 --> 01:38:32.932
It was yours.

1637
01:38:33.582 --> 01:38:36.841
You invented a series of killings
to hide the only real crime:


1638
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:40.221
The death of Mrs. eagleton.
Beth killed her,


1639
01:38:40.401 --> 01:38:42.741
just as the police had suspected
from the very beginning.


1640
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:50.301
Beth hated her life.
She couldn't put up


1641
01:38:50.481 --> 01:38:52.351
with that woman any more
so she killed her.


1642
01:38:52.521 --> 01:38:54.521
That's when she sent you a note

1643
01:38:54.821 --> 01:38:56.211
asking for help.

1644
01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:58.471
I couldn't look her in the face.

1645
01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:02.361
It was my fault that her father
was killed in that accident


1646
01:39:02.471 --> 01:39:04.601
30 years ago.

1647
01:39:05.681 --> 01:39:07.291
I couldn't let her down again.

1648
01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:09.161
We both met at the door.

1649
01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:11.071
You'd come to get rid
of the evidence,


1650
01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:14.071
but I was there, in the way,
and that spoiled everything.


1651
01:39:15.371 --> 01:39:17.151
You had to come up with
a new plan, in front of me,


1652
01:39:17.281 --> 01:39:20.461
just moments before the police
arrived. You read the word


1653
01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:22.281
"circle" in German
on the scrabble rack,


1654
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:23.491
and that gave you the idea.

1655
01:39:25.061 --> 01:39:26.501
A series with
infinite possibilities.


1656
01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:28.361
But you needed a second death

1657
01:39:28.541 --> 01:39:30.931
to convince the police
that the murderer was not Beth.


1658
01:39:31.101 --> 01:39:32.971
And unwittingly, I helped you.

1659
01:39:34.921 --> 01:39:38.271
I gave you the idea of how
to do it, without even realising.


1660
01:39:38.571 --> 01:39:39.831
An imperceptible murder.

1661
01:39:40.221 --> 01:39:41.481
A murderer who only kills

1662
01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:42.621
someone who is at

1663
01:39:42.791 --> 01:39:44.001
death's door. You only had

1664
01:39:44.181 --> 01:39:46.651
to wait for the occasion
and prick the body with a syringe.


1665
01:39:47.091 --> 01:39:49.781
That's when you sent
the second message. The fish.


1666
01:39:50.611 --> 01:39:53.091
You still didn't know
where all this was going to lead.


1667
01:39:53.261 --> 01:39:56.301
The possibilities of continuing
the series were still infinite.


1668
01:39:56.471 --> 01:39:58.651
You had to wait for
another occasion to arise.


1669
01:39:58.821 --> 01:40:00.911
And that could take weeks, months.

1670
01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:02.301
There was no hurry.

1671
01:40:02.641 --> 01:40:05.251
You probably had a different plan
for the third death,


1672
01:40:05.471 --> 01:40:08.601
but that triangle player suddenly
appeared like a gift from the gods,


1673
01:40:09.551 --> 01:40:12.511
- and you had your solution.
- At first I rejected it.


1674
01:40:12.681 --> 01:40:13.941
Too many people, too operatic.

1675
01:40:15.161 --> 01:40:15.891
Don't lie.

1676
01:40:16.071 --> 01:40:17.071
You couldn't waste

1677
01:40:17.201 --> 01:40:18.411
a chance like that.

1678
01:40:18.851 --> 01:40:22.151
What's more, there was a triangle.
It all took on meaning!


1679
01:40:23.111 --> 01:40:25.891
Beautiful... it was as if
the damned pythagoreans


1680
01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:27.541
were on your side.

1681
01:40:27.801 --> 01:40:30.541
It was perfect,
but what's more important,


1682
01:40:30.711 --> 01:40:32.491
it was totally inoffensive.

1683
01:40:32.841 --> 01:40:34.621
Until the madman appeared.

1684
01:40:35.451 --> 01:40:38.790
Any one of our acts can have
unexpected consequences.


1685
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.140
That's what you most feared.

1686
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.700
Who was to know that poor devil

1687
01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.960
was going to read
the article in the paper?


1688
01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.920
He was looking for a solution
to his daughter's problem,


1689
01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:51.000
while every day he drove to school
those healthy children


1690
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:53.480
with perfect lungs
but damaged brains.


1691
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.130
Why did they deserve to live
and not his daughter?


1692
01:40:56.650 --> 01:41:00.600
Mathematicians are not the only ones
familiar with the greeks, professor.


1693
01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.990
You gave him his solution
when you published the series.


1694
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.380
He also wanted to hide his crime.

1695
01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.990
He only had to make
a phone call, and he did.


1696
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:22.110
So...

1697
01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:25.320
You think I'm the killer.

1698
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.360
No.

1699
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:29.360
You haven't killed anyone,

1700
01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.620
but you're guilty of provoking the
deaths of those innocent children.


1701
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.230
You're guilty of arrogance,

1702
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:39.310
of using us all like
pieces on a board game.


1703
01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.310
Who the hell do you think you are?

1704
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:49.260
I hope my failure has, at least,
served to teach you something.


1705
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:53.040
Yes, one thing.

1706
01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.870
One very painful thing.

1707
01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.690
Numbers also lie.

1708
01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.120
The truth is not mathematical,
as I once believed.


1709
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.080
It's absurd, confused, random,

1710
01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:07.770
disorderly, and deeply unpleasant.

1711
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.160
I'm glad that finally we can agree
on something, Martin, my friend.


1712
01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:15.330
Just one thing has escaped you.

1713
01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.590
The real culprit.

1714
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.280
The one who triggered off
this whole string of crimes.


1715
01:42:26.410 --> 01:42:27.800
Who?

1716
01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:29.150
You, Martin.

1717
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.540
Don't make me laugh.

1718
01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:34.100
If you don't believe me,
then speak to Beth.


1719
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:36.580
She was in love with you,

1720
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:39.100
or weren't you aware of that?

1721
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:43.179
She remembered
your words exactly.


1722
01:42:44.829 --> 01:42:46.529
"You should try it."

1723
01:42:47.089 --> 01:42:50.389
"You should try it,"
pounded time and again


1724
01:42:50.569 --> 01:42:52.519
inside her head, like a hammer.

1725
01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:55.869
"You should be free, like me."

1726
01:42:58.299 --> 01:43:00.249
That's what she understood,

1727
01:43:01.689 --> 01:43:03.299
and that's what she did.

1728
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:07.679
Put an end to what
prevented her from being free...


1729
01:43:11.159 --> 01:43:12.899
Her own mother.

1730
01:43:14.239 --> 01:43:15.289
The butterfly

1731
01:43:16.759 --> 01:43:19.329
that flutters its wings
and causes a hurricane


1732
01:43:19.499 --> 01:43:21.459
on the other side of the world.

1733
01:43:23.979 --> 01:43:25.709
Sound familiar?

1734
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:30.999
Are you that butterfly, Martin?
