00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.854
Oh, come on, hon.
We just got here.


160
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.738
Check out all these babes.
So hot!


161
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.932
It's like they're in violation
of the fuckin' fire code!


162
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.535
Marty, calm down.
I see them.


163
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.818
I can also see Mimi, your wife.

164
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.732
Okay, save me,
help me, protect me.


165
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.619
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?


166
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.455
No. Just checkin' out the
hipster crowd with my pal Luke.


167
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.611
Mmm-hmm.

168
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.421
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll
leave you here all by yourself.


169
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.737
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them. (GIGGLES)


170
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.256
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?


171
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.695
Oh, she was just feeling dizzy.

172
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.539
Ducked out to check
her blood sugar.


173
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.093
MIMI: Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?


174
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.215
Oh, I, um, started to feel not-so-great
before, but I'm better now.


175
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.060
We can always go home, sweetie.

176
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.930
(CHUCKLES) Did you hear that?
"Sweetie!"


177
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.779
After she just checked
her blood sugar.


178
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.693
That's funny.
That's really good.


179
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.091
I would love to see you deal with
something like that if that was me.


180
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.457
Oh, you know, baby, I'd love to
stick you in the ass every day.


181
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.060
- How many times have I asked?
- MIMI: Honey?


182
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.256
Lots.
Not now.


183
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.975
You're the shrink, aren't you?

184
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.096
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.


185
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.100
Ah, Dr. Vanowen, that's right.
Yes, I remember.


186
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.533
Do we know each other? Uh, no.
You knew my sister.


187
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.261
She was a patient of
yours actually. Sophie?


188
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.737
Sophie Morris?

189
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.171
Oh.

190
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.257
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.


191
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.454
(SCOFFS) Some people
are just born unhappy.


192
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.333
I'm sorry. Are you
buying an apartment?


193
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.852
What? Um, no, no. I'm
friends with the architect.


194
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.931
Ah.

195
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.331
Are you?

196
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.098
No, I'm here with Joel Kotkin.
The city councilman.


197
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.975
I work for him as sort
of a personal assistant.


198
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.291
Oh.

199
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.693
I'm Anne. Anne Morris. (GIGGLES)

200
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.056
Very nice to meet you, Anne.

201
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.371
And listen, about your sister...

202
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.259
It's okay.

203
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.130
You couldn't have saved her. Her mood
disorder kind of runs in the family.


204
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.212
Unfortunately, so...

205
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.381
Well, you're not thinking of doing
something stupid, are you, Anne?


206
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.451
Me?

207
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.615
Oh, you mean like falling
for the wrong man? Well...


208
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.739
I do that all the time.

209
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.101
(GLASS SHATTERING)

210
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.771
Everything's all right!
Come on, keep partying!


211
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.897
What are you doing?

212
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.495
Phil, I should've guessed.

213
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.420
Hey, Vince, what's up? Hey. How are ya?
Thanks for comin'.


214
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.379
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped, man.


215
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.214
No worries. As long as you're okay.
You all right?


216
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.576
I'm fine.
She's fine. Come on.


217
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.335
Let me introduce
you to a colleague


218
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.136
who works with me at the office.

219
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.254
And this one works with
me down at the office.


220
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.296
(ALL CHUCKLING)

221
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.940
Or is it the other way around?

222
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.091
CHRIS: Philip?

223
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.377
Oh, my big brother.
How ya doin', man?


224
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.212
Friends of Vicky's? Bridesmaids?
Oh...


225
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.577
Come on, man. I'm still single, you know?
What are you doing?


226
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.812
What? It's not like I don't
love my little Vicky.


227
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.619
I love her madly, you know that.
All right?


228
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.613
It's not like I hate all the
other women in the world.


229
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.613
All right.
All right. Relax.


230
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.341
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.


231
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.936
Chris?

232
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.975
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.

233
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.690
MARTY: Wow!
This is impressive, Vince.


234
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.651
Check out the view.

235
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.297
Then imagine that this
is our own private oasis


236
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.735
right in the heart of downtown.

237
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.657
What do you mean?

238
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.619
A place where
no one hassles you.


239
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.094
A place you can escape
to any time you want.


240
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.701
So this is your loft?

241
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.494
No. It's ours.

242
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.499
- If you want it.
- CHRIS: What?


243
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.931
Ours?

244
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.541
Think about it.

245
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.899
No messy hotel bills. No
questionable credit card activity.


246
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:09.057
This would be our secret place to steal
away, discreetly and economically


247
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.259
in these challenging times.
A five-way split.


248
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.730
What do you think?
(CHUCKLES)


249
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.939
I don't know.
I'm not like that.


250
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.692
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little like that.


251
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.415
Yeah. Tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.


252
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.380
Bring your twins up here, give
'em a little private tour.


253
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.576
You know what they cost, Marty?

254
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.051
How much? I might have it
on me right now. Seriously.


255
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.861
Think about it.
It's a great investment.


256
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.218
A once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity.


257
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.171
I can't stay here.

258
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.133
- CHRIS: Where you going? Luke?
- MARTY: Hey, hey!


259
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.530
You cannot freak out right now.

260
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.692
We have to stay
together like we said!


261
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.977
All right. Really, Luke, you
just need to calm the fuck down.


262
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.497
No! No! It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!


263
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.374
It's not over.
Listen, we're gonna find out


264
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.293
what happened here
and we're gonna fix it!


265
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.371
Okay?

266
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.337
Try Phil again.

267
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.581
(LINE RINGING)

268
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.131
<i>This is Philip. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>


269
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.531
VINCENT: What if he doesn't show?

270
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.691
He could be out of
the country by now.


271
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.817
He'll show.

272
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.899
We can't cover for him,
Chris. Not this time.


273
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.811
MARTY: Guys!

274
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.411
Look at this.

275
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.736
What's it mean?
What does it mean?


276
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.140
COHAGAN: You know Latin, Doctor?

277
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.456
Excuse me?

278
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.817
Latin.
Do you know Latin?


279
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.461
I took it, pre
-Med, yeah.

280
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.698
What's it say on the wall there?

281
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.294
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>

282
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.179
Yeah, I know.
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>


283
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.213
I can read that.

284
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.571
What's it mean?

285
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.341
I'm guessing you already
know what it means.


286
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.458
No. We would like
to hear you say it.


287
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.898
You'd like to hear me say it. Okay.
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>


288
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.699
"Fate will unite us."

289
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.299
Now, all I can
possibly think is that


290
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.299
somebody who knows
Latin like you,


291
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.293
reached over with
this young lady's hand


292
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.896
and wrote, <i>"Fatum nos
iungebit"</i> on the wall.


293
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.251
(SCOFFS)

294
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.216
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit"</i> is wrong.

295
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.860
How so, Doctor?

296
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.294
The future imperfect tense of the
verb unite, <i>iungere</i>, is not <i>iungebit</i>.


297
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.816
It's <i>iunget.</i> It should
say, <i>"Fatum nos iunget."</i>


298
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.178
So the person you're looking for
made a classic Latin error.


299
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.140
But I'm guessing you knew that
already, too, didn't you?


300
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.899
You know the phrase "fuck you"?

301
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.010
Germanic origin.

302
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.011
Where's your brother?

303
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.692
I'm sorry, I can't
help you with that one.


304
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.376
Right. Well, actually, he's
your half-brother, isn't he?


305
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.691
Same mother, different fathers.

306
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.019
He spent some time in various
institutions with your half-sister, Zoe?


307
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.421
Yeah. That's right.

308
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.738
After our mother died, uh,

309
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.896
Philip wasn't as

(SCOFFS)

465
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.018
I told you,
I fall for the wrong men.


466
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.014
Can you keep a secret?

467
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.820
Our city councilman likes
to keep my panties with him


468
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.540
at these events, in his pocket.

469
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.333
It's a turn-on for him, the thought
of me in a crowd, so naked.


470
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.341
Only he knows.

471
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.130
Why do you let him
use you like that?


472
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.692
Who says he's using me?

473
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.341
Maybe it turns me on.

474
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.453
Maybe me telling you about
it turns me on even more.


475
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.054
I hope you don't catch cold.

476
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.290
Chris!

477
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.300
Chris, I'm sorry.

478
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.895
I don't know,
maybe I was testing you.


479
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.058
I don't need to be tested.

480
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.415
Listen, do you want
maybe get a cup of coffee?


481
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.134
Some place quiet?

482
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.571

(INAUDIBLE)

485
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.493
I'd like to use your key.

486
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.971
Just once.
It's not what you think.


487
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.417
Hey, it doesn't
matter what I think.


488
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.931
Have fun.

489
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.576
VINCENT: Does everyone
still have a key?


490
00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:52.731
'Course we do.

491
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.410
VINCENT: It's crucial
we get this right.


492
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.056
Five keys were cut. To make a
sixth, you'd need the code.


493
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.610
Which is in my safe,
so we can rule that out.


494
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.421
But there was no break-in. So
does everyone still have a key?


495
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.096
PHILIP: What? You think we've
been givin' away our keys?


496
00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.251
It's against your rules, Vince.

497
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.377
Then show me.

498
00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.612
What are we trying
to prove here?


499
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.210
Look, I don't know. Maybe
someone's lost a key, okay?


500
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.416
Let's just rule that out.

501
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.618
Okay? Look, here's mine.

502
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.737
All right?

503
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.456
Chris?
(SIGHS)


504
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.859
You didn't use a key
to get in just now.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

506
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.413
No. I didn't bring it.
Where is it?


507
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.735
I don't have it on me, okay.

508
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.494
It's not like I need it every
day, like some of you guys.


509
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.571
But you do still have it?

510
00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.460
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on
me right now is really not important.


511
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.214
It's extremely
fuckin' important!


512
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.372
Someone got in using a key
and yours is missing!


513
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.531
Is that right, Vincent?

514
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.738
Then how do you account for the
fact that the alarm was shut off?


515
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.375
So, let's just cut the bullshit,

516
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.532
'cause it definitely
had to be one of us five.

Unless...

518

Unless what?

519
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.179
Unless she let him in.

520
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.171
Oh, yeah. Then how'd
she get in, Vincent?


521
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.377
Any way you look at it, it
keeps coming back down to us.


522
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.650
And I for one would like to
know who's hiding something.


523
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.296
MIMI: <i>Where did you learn that?</i>

524
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.531
BARBARA: <i>I seriously don't believe it.</i>

525
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.611
MIMI: There's a word for that?

526
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.691
BARBARA: Yes, polyamory.

527
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.932
It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system


528
00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.540
about being
romantically involved


529
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.021
with more than one
person at the same time.


530
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.650
Uh-huh. And your
boss gets away with it?


531
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.453
Yes. He says that he's in love
with his wife and his girlfriend,


532
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.015
- so why should he have to choose?
- MIMI: Uh-huh.


533
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.933
And his wife is
amazingly cool with it.

Oh, really? Ls she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?


535
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.097
Explain. I'd like to know.
(CHUCKLES)

of philosophy, Barb.

can barely handle one woman.

540

two ladies and one guy.

fake some enthusiasm?

If you absolutely have
to invite your friends over,


549
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.261
could you at least try
to make it home on time?


550
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.971
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?


551
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.250

doesn't puke on the rug.

doesn't his wife see that?

she was just cool with it

long enough to
catch him in the act.

receipts, audio, video, the works.

went from polyamory to alimony.

in a tiny one-bedroom condo.

But I'm guessing he's happy.

new pair of fake breasts.

Wow. You all right?

Mimi, your husband tends
to talk out of his ass


618
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.695
when he's been drinking.
Yeah?


619
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.850
Come on. There we go.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

you were in here.

No problem. Ate too
much too fast, I guess.

all up in your nose and shit.

Yeah.
It's a little spicy.

I'm out of here. Bye.

you wanna tell me?

Are you keeping secrets?
(CHUCKLES)


632
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.210
What kind of secrets?

633
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.459
Is there someone else?

634
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.176
I don't know why you start
asking me silly questions,

I'd do without you.

a lot I could put up with.

LUKE: What are you doing?

648
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.855
We need to get her out of here.

649
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.534
How?
She is shackled to the bed!


650
00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.180
Can't you guys
see what's going on?


651
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.450
Someone is trying to frame us!

Who wants to frame us?

I don't know.
But think about it.


655

The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.

The Latin, the knife. Someone
did this for a reason.

Hell, the cops could
be here any second.

know who this girl is.

We don't even know
how she got in here.

Who else knew
about the arrangement?


661

Who else knows
about our arrangement?


662

girls that have been up here?

Marty?
What? Why me?

were hammered, maybe?

the rules, Vincent!

Did you key in while
someone was watching?


668

Absolutely not!
I just told you.

All right. Wait. What's your point,
Vincent? Where you going with this?


670
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.574
Someone is trying to set us up.

Like who?
I don't know.

someone with a motive.

found out something

that she wasn't too happy about.

something a little more


740
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.777
and she showed up
on our front porch.

started saying things.

will come around eventually

away for a couple days.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:05.691
Sarah Deakins.

928
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.854
(STAMMERS) Who's Sarah Deakins?

929
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.579
Wait. Who the hell is
trying to sell our loft?


930
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:16.656
You know her, Marty.

931
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.611
What?

932
00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.374
You know her, and so does Luke.

933
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.290
Sarah Deakins is
lying on the bed.


934
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.260
You guys, I promise, I've
never seen a Sarah Deakins.


935
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.536
That's not true.
You know her.


936
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.221
Why do you keep Saying that?

937
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:40.658
You met her in San Diego,
the last night, in the bar.


938
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.931
Remember? Dana's friend.

939
00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.418
The last night? I was wasted out of
my mind. The whole night's a blur.


940
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.491
(INTERCOM BUZZING) Jesus!

941
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.376
Luke, you remember
her, don't you?


942
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:52.855
That's Sarah?

943
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.137
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?


944
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.735
(STAMMERING) Yes.
I remember Sarah.


945
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.460
But how was I supposed
to know that's Sarah?


946
00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.453
Come on, guys!
What the hell's going on?


947
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.659
You guys turned her over and
looked at her face. I did not.


948

(BUZZING CONTINUES)

949
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.735
Yeah. I think
there's been a mistake.


950
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:11.858
We don't know anyone
named Sarah Deakins.


951
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.655
Marty, come on!

952
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.494
Who is it? Do we know her?
I don't know.


953
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.696
Fuck!

954
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.930
CHRIS: So, is that all you
wanted to tell us, Vince?


955
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.810
Or is there more?

956
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.300
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

957
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.417
I had a thing with her.

958
00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.411
I brought her up
here a couple times.


959
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:46.211
But I swear on my kids,

960
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.530
I had nothing to do with this.

961
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:48.657
Would you just fuckin' tell me?

962
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.891
Were you here
with her last night?


963
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.256
Were you the one who let her in?

964
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.778
I broke up with her last night.

965
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.690
I swear she was
alive when I left.


966
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.140
It still doesn't explain
why someone listed the loft!


967
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.977
Something special
or just browsing?

(SCOFFS)

969

Why don't you return my phone calls?
(SCOFFS)


970
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.061
If you're dumping me,
at least have the decency...


971
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.894
Chris, how can I dump you?

972
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:10.701
There's nothing between us.

973
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.895
So that's what I mean
to you? Nothing?


974
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.020
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?


975
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.580
No. I haven't.

976
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.212
It doesn't change
how I feel about you.


977
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:26.778
How many women have you
taken to that fuck-pad


978
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.410
you share with your
four little buddies?


979
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.979
What?
Please, Chris.


980
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.939
Save it for some girl who'll
actually buy your bullshit.


981

Anne... No.
Wait! Wait.


982

You know I'm not like that.

983
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.050
Here.

984
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.300
I only need this
if I'm with you.


985
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.815
So you keep it.

986
00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.618
If you wanna see me again,
you let me know.

(CAR HONKS)

988
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.211
Chris?

989
00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:02.934
Um, what are you doing here?

990
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.174
Shopping for Alison?

991
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.131
Uh, no... No, um, I was just
here with a colleague.


992
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.381
Does your wife know you've been
sharing the loft with your pals?


993
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.175
LUKE: I already told you, I'm not
sharing a loft with any pals.


994
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.059
I was there just once,
at a party,


995
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.575
when the building first opened.

996
00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.491
Then you have been there?

997
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.777
A minute ago, you didn't even
know where the building was.


998
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.818
I never took anyone up there. I
thought that's what you meant.


999
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.460
Well, did you know the girl?

1000
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.340
We met once in San Diego.

1001
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.697
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a
relationship with her in San Diego?


1002
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.340
That would surprise me, frankly.

1003
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:50.016
You didn't know? Isn't Vincent
Stevens your best friend?


1004
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.854
It's so obvious what
you're trying to do here,


1005
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:54.779
trying to turn us
against each other.


1006
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.171
But guess what? I'm not about
to start trashing my friend.


1007
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.019
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you
were jealous of your best friend?


1008
00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:04.331
When he's nailing all
these beautiful women?


1009
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.454
I am a married man. I'm not
interested in nailing women.


1010
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.692
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.


1011
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.816
I didn't mean jealous
of him, Mr. Seacord.


1012
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.779
I meant jealous of the women.

1013
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.372
Where do you get off
with an innuendo like that?


1014
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.340
Fucking bastards.

1015
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.980
Why are you so angry,
Mr. Seacord?


1016
00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.654
Vincent is my closest friend.

1017
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.539
And he has been for years.

1018
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.130
Yeah. Fine.
But your best friend


1019
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:43.816
is selling you out as
we speak, Mr. Seacord.


1020
00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.537
- You and the rest of your gang.
- No.


1021
00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.659
Vincent would never sell out his friends.

You heard me,
you lying piece of shit!

Put the knife down.

I didn't kill her.

- Why?

Hey, put the knife...
Put the knife down!


1031
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:06.296
Hey, hey!
Back off.


1032
00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.737
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.


1033
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.096
Someone's trying
to pin this on us.

to talk to you for just a second.

What do you mean gone?
Gone where?


1045
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:45.337
She left me.

1046
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:48.300
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up.


1047
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.259
She told her everything.
Fuck!


1048
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:54.095
Wait a minute. You didn't
tell Mimi about the loft?


1049
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:58.380

loft, Vince! It's about my wife!

Never confess, Marty.
Never confess.

tell her that I love her.

this out for you.

I will straighten this out.

What do we do now?

make a body disappear.

It's our only hope.

to get her off the bed?

the key to those cuffs?

were more your thing
than mine, Phil.

Could it be, I just wonder,

do you think he's trying
to hide something else?


1602

What would he be hiding?

The detective in the interrogation
called it a suicide.

Well, that's what
it looked like.

sleeping pills didn't kill her.
