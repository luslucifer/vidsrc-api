00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.523
<i>Dearest Stephanie,</i>

2
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.926
<i>If this letter is found on me,</i>

3
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.007
<i>if this ever reaches you,</i>

4
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.926
<i>I want you to believe every word of it
and try to understand.</i>


5
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.082
<i>It all began that night
we arrived in Istanbul.</i>


6
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.121
Oh, there's a gentleman waiting to see you.
- Oh?...


7
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.564
Mr. Graham? Mrs. Graham?
Put it there.


8
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.244
It's a pleasure!

9
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.769
Kopeikine is the name.
- How do you do...


10
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.670
You doubt that I am Kopeikine?
- No...


11
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.767
You think perhaps that I am not he?

12
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.438
My credentials!

13
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.569
<i>Stephanie,
take my word for it,</i>


14
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.409
<i>I didn't want to go out
with that fellow Kopeikine,</i>


15
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.884
<i>he's a pest!</i>

16
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.003
<i>I didn't even want him to join us for dinner,
he just talked his way into it...</i>


17
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.247
Mrs. Graham,
I am going to deprive you of your husband for awhile.


18
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.644
Aren't we, Mr. Graham?

19
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.569
We got some business to talk over...
Official.


20
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.481
Oh, can't we talk right here?

21
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.158
And bother your charming wife?

22
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.680
Oh... Well don't mind me. 
If you have to talk to Mr. 
Kopeikine, dear...

23
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.670
Sure, we can go downstairs in the bar.
- The bar...


24
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.486
Well, go to the bar
if you want to, dear.

25
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.840
Maybe we will have
a couple of drinks, too!

26
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.564
Well... the sooner you go,
the sooner you'll be back.

27
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.844
Have a good time...

28
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.647
It's not a good
time, it's business, he says.

29
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.408
Time is fleeing, Howard!

30
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.487
The company representative!

31
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.470
I'll be right back.
- Be careful.


32
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.408
Howard, where are you going?

33
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.963
I thought you said
we're going in the bar?

34
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.687
I know a much better place! Come on.

35
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.118
Oh, I haven't got my hat and coat.

36
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.400
It's just around the corner.

37
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.565
<i>Kopeikine is our company's representative
in Turkey.</i>


38
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.887
<i>And I guess he thought
he ought to show me a good time...</i>


39
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.520
<i>I didn't want a good time.
I wanted to stay with you!</i>


40
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.160
<i>He just took it for granted I didn't.</i>

41
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.679
<i>He dragged me off to that nightclub.</i>

42
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.245
<i>That's how
I happened to meet that woman,</i>


43
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.279
<i>Josette.</i>

44
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.008
I can't stay here very long,
I've got to get back to the hotel.


45
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.009
Some number, huh?

46
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.368
I'd better get on back to the hotel.

47
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.606
You might take a shine to Josette!

48
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.721
After all, this little girl is very stupid.

49
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.569
Of course Josette is stupid
too, but she has it!

50
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.165
Pardon me, Howard, 
I will be back very briefly.

51
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.766
You give me money?

52
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.205
What for?

53
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.770
Tip.
- Oh.


54
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.402
You excuse me.
If you like me, I come back!


55
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.003
I want you to meet my friend. 
He's American.

56
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.670
Howard, I will present Josette and Gogo Martel.
- How do you do?


57
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.670
You will sit please?
- Thank you.


58
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.680
I enjoyed your dancing very much, Mamselle.

59
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.166
Nonsense to say that Americans are not polite.

60
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.443
They are so clever in business
and yet so generous and sincere.

61
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.805
You hear that, Howard?

62
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.845
The champagne here is filthy.
I do not wish to leave Istanbul with a headache.


63
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.889
How long do you stay here Mr. Graham?

64
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.569
Why, he leaves here tomorrow, too.

65
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.483
Yes, I'm leaving on the morning train.

66
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.721
I'm going as far as Batoumi by boat.

67
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.679
Pardon me sir.
What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?


68
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.322
He is good, ain't he, Howard?

69
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.765
You, sir.

70
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.038
Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.526
I will now present to you
an unbelievable miracle


72
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.485
that I learned in
the mountain vastness of India.

73
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.127
And for this illusion, 
I will require

74
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.083
the assistance of some kind and gracious
gentleman from the audience...


75
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.487
Perhaps you, sir, the gentleman of the duck,
if you would be so good?


76
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.920
And now ladies and gentlemen,

77
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.480
I will join my ancestors...

78
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.368
Don't worry, Howard!

79
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.405
Ah... there you are, Howard!

80
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.487
That was a good trick!
What happened?


81
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.601
The boy didn't fire his gun,

82
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.323
someone else did!

83
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.608
The magician is dead.

84
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.646
<i>I didn't admit it, Stephanie,
but I knew then that shot was meant for me...</i>


85
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.882
<i>You know how many months I spent
for the company on the Turkish navy.</i>


86
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.008
<i>Well, time counts in this war,</i>

87
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.770
<i>and now with me out of the way,
it'll take all that time and more</i>


88
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.604
<i>with somebody else out here before Turkey
can get any new guns.</i>


89
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.163
<i>That's why they're after me.</i>

90
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.644
This is terrible!

91
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.125
You've got me involved
in a dirty nightclub shooting!

92
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.683
I've got to call my wife.

93
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.163
You've got to keep
this out of the paper.

94
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.159
Howard, you are lucky. 
Just think what happened to that magician, suppose the trick hadn't worked?

95
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.008
It's entirely beside the point!

96
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.243
I've got no business in here.

97
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.243
Howard... they are only doing their
official duty for your own good.

98
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.168
Official duty!
The whole thing's so stupid!


99
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.043
I can forgive almost anything but stupidity.

100
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.128
Wish I'd brought my topcoat...

101
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.003
This is a scandal!
We have no business with the police.


102
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.400
Maybe we won't get
our pictures in the papers.

103
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.245
Who's that?

104
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.008
That's Colonel Haki.
This is his office.


105
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.769
He's the head of the secret police.
- Secret police?!


106
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.566
He was a deputy in the Provisional Government in 1919. 
One of Ataturk's men.

107
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.001
There is a legend he can drink
two bottles of whisky without getting drunk.

108
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.680
There is also a legend that he
killed prisoners by tying them together in pairs

109
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.769
and throwing them in the river to save food and ammunition. 
But I don't believe it.

110
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.443
He is a great patriot!

111
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.567
But I wouldn't trust him with a woman...

112
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.330
Colonel Haki will see Mr. 
Howard Graham now!

113
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.118
That's us, Howard. Come!

114
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.038
You are Howard Graham?

115
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.722
Yes. What of it?

116
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.319
You are employed by
a munitions company in America?

117
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.520
What?

118
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.563
You are employed by
a munitions company in America?

119
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.283
An armament manufacturer!

120
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.670
Bainbridge and Sons.
- No, thank you!


121
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.806
This man can tell you all about it. 
He's the local agent.

122
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.762
- We know that.
- Then why ask me?


123
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.670
You're a naval ordinance expert.
- Expert!


124
00:10:55.675 --> 00:10:59.123
- Pardon?
- I'm an engineer, and naval ordinance just happens to be my subject.


125
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.769
Your government has assigned you through your company to do some important work here.
- Now look...


126
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.726
I've got my instructions. 
I've been ordered back to the States at once.

127
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.122
I'm only stopping here overnight!

128
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.521
I'm doing my best
to steer clear of trouble.

129
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.122
You realize no doubt that
you carry some valuable information?

130
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.164
Whatever that information is, it's safe
enough: I've got it in my head.

131
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.609
That's precisely why you
were brought here, Mr. Graham.

132
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.559
It's your head our
government is so interested in.

133
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.082
Suppose you had been shot
instead of that magician. What do...

134
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.405
Don't be silly!

135
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.646
The Turkish navy can get along perfectly well without me. 
The company would send out another man.

136
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.570
I'm not indispensable! There are dozens of men with my qualifications.
- Howard!


137
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.670
Somebody could be sent out from America.
- Meanwhile...


138
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.802
Or England!
To do my work over again.


139
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.846
Meanwhile the spring will be here.

140
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.203
And the Russian winter will be over,

141
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.720
and those ships will still be lying
in the dockyards at Izmir and Gallipoli,

142
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.524
still waiting for their new guns and torpedo-tubes.

143
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.326
You are our military objective.

144
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.808
I don't understand you.

145
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.127
Mr. Howard Graham,

146
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.245
you are a careful driver

147
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.566
and an imaginative pedestrian.

148
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.807
You never ride horses nor climb mountains.

149
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.001
You do not hunt big game.

150
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.840
You never felt the slightest inclination
to leap before an approaching express train.

151
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.566
I'm sure you never think of death.

152
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.884
If so, only on those occasions

153
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.287
that you take out an insurance policy.

154
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.364
Mr. Graham,

155
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.968
Mr. Graham, as your excellent brain grasps
what I am trying to say to you,

156
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.126
it's perfectly simple.

157
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.527
Someone is trying to kill you.

158
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.287
You see?

159
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.962
Kanapen... Kopeikine.

160
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.159
Kopeikine.

161
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.361
why did you take him to that cabaret?

162
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.367
He wanted a good time!

163
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.964
Pardon me, Howard,
I will be back in a jiffy.


164
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.483
Pardon me, Mr. Graham,

165
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.801
I have quite a bad headache!

166
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.967
I have here so much work,

167
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.445
so much...

168
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.203
anxiety.

169
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.240
We know who's trying to kill you.

170
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.766
Here is his picture.

171
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.679
He is a thug in the employ
of a Nazi agent, a man named Mueller,

172
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.806
operating in Sofia.

173
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.048
He doesn't look very friendly.

174
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.520
Banat?

175
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.682
I thought you said his name was Mueller?

176
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.165
Mueller is his employer.

177
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.805
This man's name is
supposed to be Peter Banat.

178
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.521
He is an assassin, a professional...

179
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.162
Mr. Graham, there are
men who are natural killers.

180
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.281
Banat is one of them.

181
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.047
He was convicted ten years
ago in Yashi of helping to

182
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.606
kick a man to death.

183
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.880
He said that his
price for killing a man

184
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:39.670
has been as low as 5000 francs.
- No thanks.


185
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.270
And expenses. Now...

186
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.118
We know a week ago
Mueller got in touch with Banat.

187
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.049
Tonight we learn Banat is here.

188
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.888
It was he who shot
at you at the cabaret,

189
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.127
a waiter identified him, 
I am dumbfounded.

190
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.844
But then I am dumbfounded every 25 minutes.

191
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.483
Can't you arrest this man?

192
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.567
We will when we find him.

193
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.920
But now we must get
you back safely to America.

194
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.639
I'll get safely back
to America, don't you worry.

195
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.887
It is always the same. 
We are the only ones in a hurry, so we are the last.

196
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.470
If we miss the boat we can sue the government.
- Mademoiselle...


197
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.763
Yes, we are leaving tonight for Batoumi.

198
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.070
This man is your husband?

199
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.845
We are partners.

200
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.008
My car is at your disposal.

201
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.470
Good night, Mr. Graham.
- Good night.


202
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.643
The Talisia belongs to a private company

203
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.604
which fronts a weekly service to
small cargo boats between here and Batoumi.

204
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.688
I'm afraid it is little
better than a floating slum!

205
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.007
Yet they carry a
few passengers, twelve at most.

206
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.407
We have checked the list on the sailing... 
Every one of them is harmless.

207
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.727
What do you mean, go by boat? 
I've got a reservation on the morning train.

208
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.003
My dear Graham, if you are to
leave on that or any other train,

209
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.049
you would be dead before you reached Batoumi.

210
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.843
This is much the best obvious
way of getting you out of Turkey.

211
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.961
The middle of the Black
Sea would be just as safe

212
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.649
as your own office.

213
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.370
Oh I don't know... 
That's quite a decision!

214
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.249
Graham... I'm not asking you to decide anything,

215
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.361
I'm telling you what you must do.

216
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.130
You are, I must remind you,
of great value to my country.

217
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.960
In your present state of health you must allow
me to protect my country's interests in my own way.

218
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.603
I do not wish to harass you,

219
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.086
but if you do not
care to follow my instructions,

220
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.759
I shall have no alternative
but to have you arrested.

221
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.643
I'll have an order issued for your deportation

222
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.849
and have you put on
board The Talisia under guard.

223
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.719
- I hope I make myself clear...
- Quite clear!


224
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.685
Would you like to handcuff me now?

225
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.370
You'll just have time if you hurry.
- Well, what...


226
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.763
- ... Arranges the best way for both of you.
- Now look here, Colonel...


227
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.761
- Haki.
- Colonel Haki...


228
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.670
You two know each other?
- How do you do? - Oh, yes.


229
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.286
I've just got to see... 
I've got to talk to her!

230
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.926
That man Kopeikine, he's with
her at the hotel now...

231
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.527
Putting her mind at rest.

232
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.888
<i>Haki thought he'd fool the Nazis</i>

233
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.048
<i>by getting me out of Turkey
through the Black Sea.</i>


234
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.530
<i>He didn't even let me
call you up to say goodbye.</i>


235
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.644
<i>That girl Josette
had nothing to do with it.</i>


236
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.603
<i>She and her partner just
happened to be leaving on the same boat.</i>


237
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.846
I thought you were
going by train, Mr. Graham?

238
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.166
Maybe the police thought the
sea air would do him good.

239
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.769
Come on, let's get our baggage through the customs.
- That's one thing I won't have to worry about...


240
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.444
Howard, wait!

241
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.522
I came to say goodbye.

242
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.284
Ain't it nice for everything
to have been arranged so quick?

243
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.488
Do you approve of
my going on this boat?

244
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.169
I do, Howard.

245
00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.881
By the way, have you
a gun in your luggage?

246
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.569
I haven't got any luggage!

247
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.484
Then you better take this...

248
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.682
I picked it up on my way to see your wife. 
It is completely loaded.

249
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.070
What did she say?
- Here.


250
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:10.846
I don't need this!

251
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.247
Put it in your pocket, it will
make you feel nicer to have it!

252
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.966
I never fired one
of these things, you know!

253
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.470
That's a good one, Howard!
- What?


254
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.530
You're a ballistics expert and
you never fired a gun!

255
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.958
Well, I just never did!

256
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.479
It's very simple, you just
point it and pull the trigger.

257
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.670
Oh, I know how it works.
- Take it with you anyway.


258
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.963
Look Howard, they are loosing it.

259
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.683
You'd better go. Come!

260
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.323
Write me a line.

261
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.646
Uh... Goodbye.

262
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.283
Goodbye, Howard.

263
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.123
I was just going to telephone my wife.

264
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.959
I will see that she is
assured and safely on the train.

265
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.329
What's that? Cows?

266
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.929
Mostly cows.

267
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.164
It's clever, isn't it?

268
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.689
What's clever?

269
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.168
For you, Graham, so unlikely means of transportation

270
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.520
is better than a disguise...

271
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.727
Now with Mrs. Graham,

272
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.670
it might be safer to practice a little deception, hmm?
- Hmm?


273
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.038
You can cable her when you
stop at Trabzon. "C'est la guerre. "

274
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.761
What?

275
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.439
War is war.

276
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.799
You have your passport?

277
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.365
Oh... yes.

278
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.209
Oh, I've got my wife's here too...

279
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.685
And I see you're arming yourself...

280
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.646
It's one thing to be
a soldier, is it not...

281
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.128
If the enemy is not looking for you in particular, because you're Mr. 
Howard Graham...

282
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.405
The fellow next to you
will do just as nicely.

283
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.645
That's Stephanie's.

284
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.470
I will see to it that it is delivered...
- Thank you.


285
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.483
You have this advantage
over the soldier, Mr. Graham:

286
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.045
you can run away without being a coward.

287
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.847
Do not worry about your wife, Graham.

288
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.446
I will take care of her personally.

289
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.765
Happy journey.

290
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.365
This way.

291
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.319
Cabin 2.

292
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.070
Are you Cabin 2? Graham, Howard?
- Yes.


293
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.764
Haven't you got any better accommodations?

294
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.881
The cabins are all the same, Monsieur.

295
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.206
About your luggage, we don't
seem able to find it.

296
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.082
I haven't got any luggage!

297
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.720
- No luggage?
- That's right, no luggage!


298
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.769
- Hello!
- I do not think that you are sincere after all.


299
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.125
What do you mean?

300
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.480
Tell me truthfully why
you are on this boat.

301
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.324
You wouldn't believe me.

302
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.601
Very well, I'm not inquisitive.

303
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.238
Well if you really want to know, 
I took the boat to get away from somebody who's trying to shoot me.

304
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.089
I'd sooner you'd be grave
about lying than joke about killing.

305
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.769
If you wish me to like
you, you mustn't say such things.

306
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.403
I apologize.

307
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.159
Are you going somewhere on
behalf of a dancing engagement?

308
00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.129
India perhaps, I do
not know. I hope so.

309
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.527
So much is closed
on account of the war.

310
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.402
How long have you been dancing?

311
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.919
Since I was 10, that's 20 years ago.

312
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.800
You see, I do not
lie to you about my age.

313
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.002
I was born in the Pyrenees,
my mother and father were very poor.


314
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.438
But honest, no doubt?

315
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.200
Oh no... my father
was not at all honest.

316
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.607
I tell everything about myself but about you I
know nothing, except that you have a nice house...

317
00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.726
I hardly ever hear english spoken,
so I am interested at once.

318
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.522
You are English, sir?

319
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.085
American.

320
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.724
I am Turkish. I sell tobacco.

321
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.722
Thermo Pazar and Company.

322
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.881
My name is Mr. Kuvetli, sir.

323
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.808
My name is Howard Graham.

324
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.470
This is Mademoiselle Josette.
- So good.


325
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.804
My boss Pazar cannot speak
english and he cannot write,

326
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.363
he is ignorant.

327
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.728
I reply to all favors
from England and elsewhere abroad,

328
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.648
but he knows slot about tobacco!

329
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.169
We produce best. Please...

330
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.568
Try cigarette made with tobacco
from Thermo Pazar and Company, please.

331
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.330
It's stuffy in here, 
I would like to go outside.

332
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.964
You will come with me?

333
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.128
Thank you, Mr. Kuvetli.
Will you join us?


334
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.242
Cannot you be quiet!
You are keeping the whole ship awake. Shh!


335
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.647
I'm terribly sorry...

336
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:11.924
See you later.
- Yes, please.


337
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.448
I do not like that man.

338
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.006
Personally I like the Turks.

339
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.041
Would you like to go upstairs?

340
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.161
I really ought to get some sleep.

341
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.040
As you wish.

342
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.729
It's been quite a night!

343
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.402
Wish I'd brought my topcoat.

344
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.169
It is pretty up there.

345
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.803
Gogo is probably asleep.

346
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.001
He will want to
play cards with you tomorrow.

347
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.164
I'll try to think of
a game that I play well.

348
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.404
He would win in any
case, but I have warned you.

349
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.166
I'll remember that when I lose.

350
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.286
<i>Stephanie,
you must have known when you married me</i>


351
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.481
<i>that I'm nothing very special.</i>

352
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.889
<i>I'm a good naval engineer
but outside of that I'm no hero.</i>


353
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.962
<i>I think maybe I'm a coward.</i>

354
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.480
<i>You used to laugh at me sometimes
and call me a stuffed shirt.</i>


355
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.842
<i>So please, Stephanie, try to
understand about that girl.</i>


356
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.440
<i>I just needed somebody to talk to.
I'm lonely, Stephanie.</i>


357
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:14.523
<i>I'm scared.</i>

358
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.205
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.


359
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.885
My name is Haller,
Dr. Fritz Haller.


360
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.518
Mine is Howard Graham.

361
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.209
I should explain I am a German.

362
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.765
A good German of the former Germany.

363
00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.483
I am on my way back to Tehran.

364
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.927
I am travelling on
a League of Nations passport.

365
00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.643
I'm an American.

366
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.640
This steward is an imbecile.

367
00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.286
The French lady and her husband
at the next table were placed again.

368
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.163
They objected to eating with
what they call the enemy,

369
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.326
insulted me and moved.

370
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.120
The food here is very monotonous
without conversation.


371
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.287
I agree with you there.

372
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.119
You've been long in Turkey?

373
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.286
A few weeks. I came there from Persia.

374
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.670
- Oil?
- No, Mr. Graham. Archeology.
- Oh.


375
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.370
I was investigating the early pre
-Islamic cultures.

376
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.470
Forgive me, I am boring you already.
- Oh, not at all.


377
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.765
War!

378
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.680
It is not businesslike.
It makes it very difficult to earn money.


379
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.608
Money? You say that?

380
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.721
Well, I take no side. 
I do not care who wins.

381
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.919
War is terrible!

382
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.483
War is stupid...

383
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.646
it is all very bad for business.

384
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.325
Thirst for food and tongues for the wise!

385
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.670
I think I will go now and look after my wife. Excuse me, please?
- Certainly.


386
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.040
War is the last refuge of the capitalist.

387
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.846
He talks like a fool, but
you should take no notice, Monsieur.

388
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.201
He was a brave soldier,
he won the silver war badge.


389
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.323
A little piece of silver outside the chest
to serenade the little piece of steel inside, eh?

390
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.846
It is the women I
think who should fight these wars.

391
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.847
They're more ferocious as patriots than the men.

392
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.244
Don't you agree, sir?

393
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.048
Me? Please.

394
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.842
I am neutral, you understand.

395
00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.883
I know nothing, I have no opinion,
I sell tobacco.


396
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.682
Tobacco? In Istanbul?

397
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.039
What company?

398
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.470
Pazar and Company, Istanbul.
- Pazar? I don't under...


399
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.645
I see... There is Trabzon!

400
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.720
We should go ashore and get some real food! 
It'll be such a relief to get out of here...

401
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.841
All those mosques and minarets! 
Are you not coming?

402
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:51.239
Good afternoon.

403
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:52.803
Good afternoon.

404
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.889
"Good afternoon", is that
all you have to say?

405
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.364
What should I say?

406
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.607
I thought that all Americans get out
of bed early to eat a big breakfast.

407
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.688
I get out of bed at
10, but you're nowhere to be found.

408
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.125
The steward says you're still in your cabin.

409
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.770
Excuse?

410
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.670
I didn't get to bed until 6.
- Oh?


411
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.839
How do you do?

412
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.604
Do you play poker?

413
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.079
Why, certainly... 
But not very well.

414
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.405
I told you.

415
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.407
She thinks because I win I cheat.

416
00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.202
I do not care what she thinks!

417
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.083
People are not compelled by
law to play cards with me.

418
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.202
Why do they squeal like
stuck pigs when they lose?

419
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.889
Well, it is illogical.

420
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.081
It's very boring to listen to english!

421
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.281
I'm going to drink some brandy.

422
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.689
Let's go out on deck.

423
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.248
He's very unpleasant today. 
It's because he's disappointed.

424
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.920
He thought there were going to be some
pretty little girls he could roll his eyes at.

425
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.600
He always has great success with
pretty little girls and old women.

426
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.279
Are you coming?

427
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.805
Sorry, Mr...

428
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.401
<i>Colonel Haki told me</i>

429
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.682
<i>he'd send you ahead
to meet me in Batoumi.</i>

430
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.362
<i>The boat stopped at Trabzon,
I sent you the cable.</i>


431
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.449
"Stephanie dearest, 
I think of you all the time, 
I dream about you at night. "

432
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.279
That's right. One message, two addresses. 
Send it right off.

433
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.670
"Looked for wire here but none. 
Heaven's sake why?"

434
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.726
"Everything that has happened beyond my control."

435
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.079
That's fine, thank you.

436
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.168
"See you Grand Hôtel Batoumi Saturday. 
I love you only you."

437
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.644
Very good, sir.

438
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:57.670
Ah, there you are, Professor...Good razor, thank you.
- Not at all.


439
00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:58.840
Didn't go ashore?

440
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.670
No, Mr. Graham. My wife is still indisposed.
- Oh, sorry.


441
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.964
I thought you were going
to see the sites with Mr....

442
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:05.807
Kuvetli?

443
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.568
Oh, so that is his name?

444
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.203
He speaks german quite well.

445
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.889
I think he's traveled quite a bit.

446
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.368
He interests me, this Kuvetli. 
He has a way of talking without saying anything.

447
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.209
Maybe it's got something to
do with his being a salesman.

448
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.048
He is too simple to be true.

449
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.128
Who ever heard of a simple Turkish businessman?

450
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.203
No, he is a man
who wishes to be underrated.

451
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.601
Why? He's not trying to sell us tobacco.

452
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.280
Perhaps as you suggest he
regards the world as his customer.

453
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.646
We have a new passenger.

454
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.203
The Greek woman at the next table,

455
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.844
you remember I told you
her husband was killed in Athens?

456
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.165
Quiet, she'll hear you!

457
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.807
Mr. Graham, did you enjoy
your excursion ashore this afternoon?

458
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.524
Why...I didn't go.

459
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.005
I was, but...

460
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.962
- Yes?
- I want to talk to the Captain.


461
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.529
Now what's the matter, Monsieur?

462
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.608
It's absolutely necessary that
I be put ashore immediately!

463
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.246
I want to be put ashore!

464
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.088
It's too late...
The pilot-boat is gone.

465
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.518
I'm willing to pay.

466
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.766
This is a ship, Monsieur. Not a taxi.

467
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.279
We carry cargo around on a schedule.

468
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.606
This is a question of life and death.

469
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.009
- Well, naturally...
- A man on this boat


470
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.644
is here for the
express purpose of murdering me.

471
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.322
I am not crazy!

472
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.559
No, not at all, Monsieur.

473
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.046
Now what's his name?

474
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.080
Banat.

475
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.324
B
-A
-N
-A
-T.

476
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:12.804
Just a minute.

477
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.558
What's so funny?

478
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.602
There's no one by that name.

479
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.005
He's the passenger who sat
across from me at dinner!

480
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.280
- The number 7 cabin.
- I don't know what his number is.


481
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:25.807
Mavrodopoulos.

482
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.648
Why, he's a Greek businessman.

483
00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:32.519
Will you please radio Colonel Haki
of the Turkish police in Istanbul...

484
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.483
We are no longer in Turkish territorial waters!

485
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.408
In any case our wireless
is for navigational purposes only...

486
00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.760
I tell you the
man means to kill me!

487
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.401
Why?

488
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.680
Because he's been paid to kill me!

489
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.670
Who pays him?
- The...


490
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.521
Can't you speak english?

491
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:53.923
The Captian speaks only greek,
italian, russian and turkish, Monsieur.

492
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.883
But I understand.

493
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.769
You have perhaps had a bad dream.
- I haven't had any bad...


494
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.122
I suggest that you lie
down in your cabin for awhile.

495
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.959
And remember, nobody's going to
murder you on this ship.

496
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.523
There are too many people.

497
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.518
In any case this ship
stops in Batoumi and not before.

498
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.470
Now if you'll excuse me, 
I have work to do.

499
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.470
And if you close the
door as you go out.

500
00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.070
Boom boom!

501
00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.045
- Hello, Mr. Graham.
- Good evening.


502
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.689
It's going to be nasty out tomorrow.
- Yes, it is.


503
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.047
I don't mind. But I'm
afraid my wife doesn't like it...

504
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.048
What are you doing out there?
You'll catch cold, come back to bed.


505
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.367
You should go back to bed yourself, chérie.
You're more delicate than I.


506
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.764
Have you got a wife, sir?

507
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.609
Yes I have. Excuse me.

508
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.199
- Has your wife got a bad temper, Mr. Graham?
- No, very good.


509
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.286
You're lucky.

510
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.321
For years I lived in misery.

511
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.282
Then one day I made a great discovery.

512
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.242
There was a socialist meeting
and I went to it.

513
00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.769
I wasn't a socialist, understand...

514
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.042
I went to this meeting because I was curious.
The speaker was good.


515
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.048
Then a week later we went out with
some friends, and I repeated what I heard.

516
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.043
My wife laughed in a very peculiar way,

517
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.286
and when I got home, 
I made a discovery.

518
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.005
I found out my wife was a
snob, and even more stupid than I dreamed.

519
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.929
She said that I humiliated her by
saying such things as if I believed them.

520
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.768
And all her friends were respectable people,

521
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.359
and I mustn't speak as
if I was a working man.

522
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.719
She wept!

523
00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.363
Then I knew that I was free.

524
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:29.404
Mr. Graham, I bought books and
pamphlets to make my arguments more damaging.

525
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.965
My wife became very docile.

526
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.918
She even cooked things I liked,
just so I wouldn't disgrace her.

527
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.165
I see.

528
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.725
So...you don't believe these things you say?
- No.


529
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.289
That's where my little joke comes in.

530
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.846
Mr. Graham, for awhile I was
free, then a terrible thing happened.

531
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.041
I found I began to
believe these things that I said.

532
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.127
These books I read showed
me that I'd found a truth.

533
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.640
I, a capitalist by instinct,
became a socialist by conviction.

534
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.604
Worse than that, there was a strike at
the factory, and I, the manager, supported the strikers!

535
00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.200
I didn't belong to a union, naturally, and so I was dismissed. 
It was ridiculous!

536
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.244
So here I am.

537
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.647
I've become a man in my home
at the price of becoming a bore outside.

538
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:15.770
Josette!

539
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.202
Banking! What is banking but usury?

540
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.889
And where has our American been?

541
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.921
Today the usurers are
the gods of the earth,

542
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.161
and the only mortal
sin is to be poor.

543
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.840
There are so many
poor people it is terrible!

544
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.722
Banking! What does he know about banking?

545
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.923
I thought you were ill, sir? 
You are better now?

546
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:51.562
Yes, thanks.

547
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.123
You've been ill?

548
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:54.919
I...felt tired.

549
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.524
It is the ventilation.

550
00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.047
I myself have felt a nausea and
a headache since we got on this ship.

551
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.246
We should complain!

552
00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.603
Mrs. Matthews is right. 
The ventilation isn't good.

553
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.169
I think we should go outside.

554
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.838
I know you must
be ill, you are polite!

555
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.398
I'll go with you.

556
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.359
It was not at
all stuffy in the saloon.

557
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.684
Now you shall tell me
what is really the matter.

558
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.680
Chéri, I am sorry, but I
have seen people who are afraid before.

559
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.570
They do not look at
all like people who are tired

560
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.125
or people who feel
faint in a stuffy room.

561
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.286
They have a special look about them.

562
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.722
Their faces look very small
and gray around the mouth.

563
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.839
And they can't keep their hands still.

564
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.806
I'm glad we can walk like this together.

565
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.320
Good evening, Mr. Graham.
Taking your constitutional, I see?


566
00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.928
Remember I told you I came on this ship
to avoid somebody who was trying to shoot me?

567
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.802
Yes, I remember. 
It was a bad joke.

568
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.808
A very bad joke. 
Only it's true.

569
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.966
You're lying to me!

570
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.364
I'm afraid not.

571
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.606
What have you done that
someone should wish to kill you?

572
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.925
Nothing.

573
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.289
Some business competitors don't want
me to get back to America.

574
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:20.843
You are lying!

575
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.203
Yes I am lying, but not very much.

576
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.650
There are some people who don't want
me to get back to the States.

577
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.839
Who are they?

578
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.999
I only know one. 
His name is Mueller or Miller or something...

579
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.470
He lives in Sofia, he's a Nazi agent.
- The salaud!


580
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.769
But he cannot touch you now!

581
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.204
I'm afraid he can.

582
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.165
That fat man aboard is working for him.

583
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.370
The Greek?

584
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.725
He's not a Greek. 
His real name is Banat.

585
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.363
He's been hired to kill me.

586
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.760
- How do you know?
- I've seen his picture.


587
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.767
- This is not very nice.
- No, it's not.


588
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.518
He knows you suspect
him, he was watching you.

589
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.200
Kuvetli was watching you also. 
You look so curious, you see.

590
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.642
You mean I look frightened?

591
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.489
Frightened to death!

592
00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.449
I was frightened, 
I'll admit it.

593
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.405
Why shouldn't I be? 
I'm not used to people trying to kill me.

594
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.248
Besides, somebody's stolen my gun.

595
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.719
You needn't worry. 
I can tell you something.

596
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.470
This fat man doesn't carry a gun.
- How do you know?


597
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:24.245
His clothes are tight. 
If he carried a gun, one could see the shape of it in his pocket.

598
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.486
He's got a gun, I know.

599
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.608
He must keep it in his cabin.

600
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.849
He's in the saloon now.

601
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.518
I could see that he doesn't go
to his cabin for a long time.

602
00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.368
- How?
- Gogo will do it.


603
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.003
I will not have to tell Gogo anything about you. 
Gogo will play cards with him.

604
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.484
Will Gogo ask him?

605
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.478
I will tell Gogo that I saw this man
open a wallet with a lot of money in it.

606
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.670
Gogo will see that he plays cards...
You don't know Gogo.

607
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.481
- Are you sure he can keep him in there?
- I'll make certain.


608
00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.043
You wait here.

609
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.361
Won't you join me, Mr. Graham?

610
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.520
I'm just getting some fresh air.
- Oh.


611
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.566
To see the land from a ship,
or to see a ship from the land...


612
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.603
I used to like both. 
Now I dislike both.

613
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.721
When a man reaches my age,

614
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.398
he grows I think to resent subconsciously

615
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:22.444
the movement of everything except the
respiratory muscles which keep him alive.

616
00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.207
Movement is change.

617
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.570
And to an old man, change means death.

618
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.925
Excuse me.

619
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.045
I think I will say good night, Mr. Graham.
- Good night.


620
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.365
Good night, Mademoiselle.

621
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.270
I mustn't stay. I came only to tell you that it's all right.
- Good.


622
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.604
But be sure to come back to the
saloon after you have been to his cabin

623
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.670
so that I know that you have finished.
- All right.


624
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.070
Boom boom!

625
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.281
Oh Mr. Graham, 
I have been waiting for you.

626
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.284
This is what you have
been looking for, isn't it?

627
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.448
Close the door, please.

628
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:18.486
I thought I had
better keep this for Mavrodopoulos.

629
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.600
Banat!

630
00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.842
Banat's easier to say.

631
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.198
I wonder if your
name happens to be Mueller.

632
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.805
You have guessed it,
Mr. Graham. I am Mueller.

633
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:32.010
But I rather like myself as an archeologist.

634
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.640
I got my little speeches from this.

635
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.000
The Sumerian Pantheon by Fritz Haller.

636
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.805
Mr. Graham, I should not like to think
of you being murdered by any employee of mine.

637
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.520
But as things stand at the present,

638
00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:49.200
you will be dead within a very few
moments of your landing at Batoumi tomorrow morning.

639
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.848
If you should die before
you get back to America,

640
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.359
somebody else will be sent
here to take your place,

641
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.362
but your work will be delayed.

642
00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.049
That is all we're interested in.

643
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.410
Mr. Graham, you are a fortunate man!

644
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.118
What does that mean?

645
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.838
- You are going to catch typhus.
- What?


646
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.121
When you get to Batoumi tomorrow morning,

647
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.844
you'll be taken to a small, private hospital.

648
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.280
In six weeks, you will have recovered.

649
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.203
How does that appeal to you, Mr. Graham?

650
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.004
Has it occurred to you that I
might not be so stupid as you think?

651
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.802
Graham, you are a fool!

652
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.768
You know nothing, nothing!

653
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:25.528
Oh, I don't?

654
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.721
One of the things
you do not know is

655
00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.682
that Colonel Haki considered it advisable

656
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:34.087
to install one of his agents
onboard this ship to watch over you.

657
00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:37.841
I tried hard yesterday to
interest you in Mr. Kuvetli.

658
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.481
Are you trying to tell me
that Kuvetli is a Turkish agent?

659
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.648
I wanted to see you before
he made himself known to you.

660
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.682
He has his duty to do,

661
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:51.122
and doubtless will have evolved some
laborious plan for getting you to safety.

662
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.927
What I wanted to warn you
against is telling him of my suggestion.

663
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.248
It will be embarrassing for both of us

664
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.806
if an agent of the Turkish
government should know of our little deception.

665
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.887
You see what I mean, Mr. Graham?

666
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.804
If you let Mr. 
Kuvetli into our secret,

667
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.169
you destroy your only chance
of returning to America alive.

668
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.481
It's a solemn thought, isn't it?

669
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.770
Graham?

670
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:35.770
Graham!

671
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.046
Go to the wall. 
I'm in the next cabin.

672
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.844
- Well?
- This is Kuvetli.


673
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.640
We'll meet on the
well deck in five minutes.

674
00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.806
Leave before me and wait there.

675
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.367
I think it best if no
more of your conversations are overheard.

676
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.961
All right.

677
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.882
- Where are you?
- Here, Graham!


678
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.279
If you're a Turkish agent,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

679
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.082
From Colonel Haki to you.

680
00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.046
I was sworn to
keep my identity secret...until necessary.

681
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.769
Did you know that Mueller was aboard?

682
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.359
I didn't know it was Mueller,
until I saw him talking to Banat.

683
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:59.080
Mueller wants me to lay low in
some sort of private hospital for awhile.

684
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.767
Did you overhear that, too?

685
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.403
He underrates you, Graham.

686
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.444
He simply tried to persuade you to allow
yourself to be murdered in the most convenient manner.

687
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:12.364
Oh...And I'll be killed
if I accept his proposal...

688
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.124
and I'll be killed if I don't.

689
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.003
Not necessarily.

690
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.040
You must go back to Mueller. 
You must tell him you agree to his suggestion.

691
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:22.999
Tell him you do not trust me. 
Tell him I threatened you.

692
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:25.123
What with? Death?

693
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.038
That'd be a little silly, wouldn't it?

694
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.922
Not so silly, Graham.

695
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.070
You must obey my orders.
- Well...


696
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.249
I'm a Turk, Graham.

697
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.645
I fought with the Gazi for Turkey's freedom.

698
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.766
I'm ready to give my life to
protect the great work we have done.

699
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.484
Do you think it strange then, that
I should not hesitate to give yours?

700
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:48.470
I guess not. I'll do anything you say.
- Good.


701
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:52.769
Now tonight after you have seen Mueller, you must go to your cabin and lock yourself in.
- All right.


702
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.765
But early tomorrow morning, before the ship docks,

703
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:59.201
you must go to the cabin at
the end of the corridor, cabin number 5.

704
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.601
It's empty. Stay there.

705
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.924
Mueller and Banat will have to
wait for you on the dock.

706
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.687
But I shall have gone ashore earlier on
the pilot boat to arrange for their arrest.

707
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.843
Now do you understand?

708
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:12.280
Yes, I think I do.

709
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.323
You feel better now, hmm?

710
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.359
Good luck, Graham.

711
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.123
- You have seen Kuvetli?
- I have.


712
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.240
Well?

713
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.008
I've decided to accept your advice.

714
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.405
- At Kuvetli's suggestion?
- My own.


715
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.009
Did he mention me by name?

716
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.121
Yes. He warned me against you.

717
00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.082
And how did you treat the warning?

718
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.600
I've decided to ignore
it and follow your plan.

719
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:40.209
I don't trust that fellow. 
We've got to throw him off the scent somehow.

720
00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.287
Kuvetli will cause no trouble.

721
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.126
Good morning Madam, 
I'd like to speak to your husband for a moment.

722
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.764
Of course, I'm easy to approach. 
You look serious, my friend.

723
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.769
I'll be back in a minute.
- Come in here, sir.


724
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.480
- I need your help.
- Why, certainly!


725
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.681
- I want you to take a message for me.
- All right.


726
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.881
Mr. Matthews, in a way,

727
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.044
at the moment...

728
00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.884
I'm in the enjoined
services of the Allied Governments.

729
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.444
When I get off the ship this morning, there's
a good chance I may be killed by German agents.

730
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.924
You're in the American secret service?

731
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.360
I want you to go
to the Turkish Consul in Batoumi,

732
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.367
and give them a message for me. 
Will you do that?

733
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.320
What's the message?

734
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.206
Tell him to tell Colonel Haki,

735
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.078
H
-A
-K
-I in Istanbul,

736
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:10.969
that I'm in trouble.

737
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.160
Is that all?
- Well...


738
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.568
In the event of my death,

739
00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:20.159
ask him to notify the American Consul.

740
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:22.687
Of course, Mr. Graham.

741
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:25.642
I'd like to say something about my wife.

742
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.648
I understand, you're in the American secret service.

743
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.444
One doesn't confide these things. 
But I'm not a fool!

744
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.318
Why don't we take
our revolvers and shoot down...

745
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.280
Wait a minute!

746
00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.766
Did you say you had a revolver?

747
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.470
Why no, I haven't got any revolver.
- Oh.


748
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.606
But I thought of course that you had.

749
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:44.479
I'm sorry, Mr. Graham.

750
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.960
I'll...deliver your message though.

751
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.525
Thanks.

752
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.325
She will come back. Why don't you sit down and wait?
You don't understand, eh?


753
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.282
She is very pretty, no? But she has no sense.
She is a woman,


754
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.845
and women do not understand business.

755
00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.162
I'm Josette's partner, so I
have an interest in Josette.

756
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.009
You wish to marry her?

757
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:48.361
What?

758
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.003
I do not give her up for nothing.

759
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:54.123
Together Josette and me, we earn
2000 francs a week by dancing.

760
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.558
It's a lot of money, huh?

761
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:57.289
- Look!
- But I will give her up.


762
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.003
- Have you got a revolver?
- A revolver?


763
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.201
You do not believe that
we earn 2000 francs a week?

764
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.002
Oh sure...only...

765
00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.723
Why don't you and I and
Josette get off the boat together?

766
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:12.727
Then we can talk
about all of this later.

767
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.399
Well chéri, is everything settled?

768
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:17.470
He wants us to meet him later.
- No, I mean...


769
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:20.470
Your car is waiting, Mr. Graham.
- Oh.


770
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.039
Go on, chéri. 
We'll all meet later.

771
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:28.770
Excuse me.

772
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.841
We will join you on the dock.

773
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:38.400
Mr. Graham!

774
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.082
I'm sorry about the gun, Mr. Graham.

775
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:48.803
But I do have a knife!

776
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.805
Please take it.

777
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.160
I know...

778
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.567
Take it anyway. 
One thing more.

779
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.039
I have this.

780
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.649
I don't know what I'll do with that.

781
00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:08.203
Nor do I, but look!

782
00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.048
I put a point on it.

783
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:11.527
Good morning.

784
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.129
Goodbye, Mr. Graham. 
I'll be discreet.

785
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.719
Discreet? What is there to be discreet about?

786
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:16.999
Ah, you may ask!

787
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.201
Mr. Graham and I are going
to blow up the Bank of England...

788
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.208
Seize Parliament, shoot the gentry,
and set up a Communist government!

789
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.670
You should not say such things, even for a joke!
- A joke!


790
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:25.647
You'll find out if
it's a joke or not...

791
00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:28.205
when we drag these people through their
houses, and shoot them down with machine guns!

792
00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.725
- If someone should hear you say such things!
- Let them hear!


793
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.670
Goodbye, Mr. Graham. Good luck.
- Thank you.


794
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:50.280
Sorry.

795
00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:42.845
I haven't seen Mr. 
Kuvetli this morning.

796
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.845
I hope that everything's
going to be all right.

797
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.881
This way please, Mr. Graham.

798
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:59.040
Excuse me.

799
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.803
Mr. Graham! You have a weapon.

800
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.479
What did you think
you would do with this?

801
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.607
I don't know. I just
thought I'd bring it along.

802
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:41.440
The tire!

803
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:08.370
Is Mrs. Howard Graham registered here?

804
00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:13.479
Room 55. She arrived this morning.

805
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:14.805
May I speak to her, please?

806
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.363
Who should I say is calling?

807
00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:17.759
Her husband.

808
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.441
Hello, Stephanie?
This is Howard.


809
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:27.368
<i>Howard! Well come right up!</i>

810
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.282
- Where's the elevator?
- Right here, sir...Fifth floor.


811
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.242
- Stephanie!
- Howard darling!


812
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.925
It's wonderful to see you!

813
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.286
But darling, what happened to you?
Where have you been?


814
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.766
I'll tell you all about it in the tub.
What I need is a good hot bath.


815
00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:01.126
Your company representative's here, Mr. Ridgely.

816
01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.604
Bill Ridgely?

817
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:06.286
But darling, we've been looking all over town for you.
Your boat got in this morning!


818
01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:08.470
We'll talk it all over later...Hello, Bill!
- Hello, Howard.


819
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.725
You are late.

820
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.203
Better late than never,
that's what I always say.

821
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.601
If you gentlemen will excuse me...

822
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.608
I'm sure you two old friends
must have a lot to talk about!

823
01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.005
It was very stupid of
you to come here, Mr. Graham.

824
01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.565
You have been a lot of trouble. 
More trouble than you are worth.

825
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.670
Let us get this over as quickly as possible.
- Howard!...Oh, Howard!


826
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.606
Yes, Stephanie?

827
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.841
If you and Mr. 
Ridgely have any business to talk over,

828
01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:40.245
please go right ahead
and don't worry about me.

829
01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:43.965
I'm invited downstairs for a cocktail. 
You're to join us as soon as you're through.

830
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.008
I am perfectly willing to spare your wife.

831
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.801
I didn't see how I could refuse.

832
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.807
You'll forgive me, Mr. Ridgely?

833
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.969
Where are you going, dear?

834
01:00:58.890 --> 01:00:59.845
Mrs. Graham,

835
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:03.202
may I present a business associate, Mr. Banat?

836
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.288
How do you do, Mr. Banat.

837
01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:08.209
Oh...and Mr. Graham, Mr. Banat.

838
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.650
I hate to take your
husband away from you, Mrs. Graham.

839
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.648
That's quite all right. 
I'm quite used to it.

840
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.408
Besides, tonight I have company.

841
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:24.283
A charming gentleman. 
He flew with me from Istanbul.

842
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:26.685
Perhaps you've heard of him...Colonel Haki.

843
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:33.670
Mrs. Graham, I wonder if you would do your husband a great favor and come with me.
- Why...


844
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:35.483
It will only be a moment.

845
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:37.043
But I don't understand.

846
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.889
Please, it will all be explained later.

847
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.728
Won't you please go down to the lobby
and hold Colonel Haki there for a moment?

848
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.470
Of course, Mr. Ridgely, if you put it that way.
- Thank you.


849
01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.569
Come in, come in!

850
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.670
Is this Mr. Graham's room?
- Yes.


851
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.470
<i>Is this Mr. Graham?
- Yes.</i>


852
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:17.325
That stupid clerk here asked me if I
wanted to speak to Mr. or Mrs. Graham...

853
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:18.758
That would mean that you are married?

854
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.642
Yes.

855
01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:24.470
Do not be embarrassed, chéri, we can still be friends.
- Well...


856
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:28.808
You think I'm angry, you don't believe me. 
I will prove it.

857
01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:32.238
<i>Gogo is on his way up to settle matters with you. 
But I will stop him.</i>

858
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.441
No!...No, don't do that.

859
01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.129
The best way.

860
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:39.482
Goodbye, Mr. Graham. 
All men are not sincere.

861
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.483
All through already?

862
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:14.329
Have you seen Colonel Haki anywhere?

863
01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:15.883
Colonel Haki? I saw
him just a moment ago.

864
01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:31.519
A crazy man just shot at me!

865
01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.079
They're crazy!

866
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.762
- That's terrible!
- What happened?


867
01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.484
He says a man
has fallen in the street.

868
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:11.364
A crazy man just shot at me!

869
01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:18.559
Mr. Ridgely!

870
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:19.680
Professor Haller!

871
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.759
Graham! Look out!

872
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:52.446
"Stephanie, I can't understand
why you're mad at me.

873
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.670
"That girl didn't mean a thing to me, really. 
Won't you please..."

874
01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:58.670
Good evening!
- Oh, hello.


875
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:59.958
You're writing a letter?

876
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.809
I'm trying to finish one
I started on the boat.

877
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.470
He says he's got a message for you from Stephanie.
- Oh?


878
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.470
Mrs. Graham.
- All right.


879
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:09.679
No speaky!

880
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.166
"Could you please forgive me.

881
01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:15.959
"I love you more than
anyone in the whole world..."

882
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.762
He says she's waiting for you upstairs!

883
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:20.006
Tell her to hold her horses!

884
01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:24.567
"Your devoted husband..."

885
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:31.162
I wonder why do you always finish
the letters you're going to tear up?

886
01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:35.400
"Howard."

887
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:37.608
My compliments, Graham!

888
01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:40.806
Banat is a dangerous
man, you had no gun.

889
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:42.284
I got mad.

890
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.285
I spent too much time running away.
