Are they on?

3
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.177
Yep. So, introduce yourself.

4
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.374
Okay. Hey, I'm Frank. 
How you doing?

5
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.859
Don't answer that. 
That's rhetorical.

6
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.372
Okay. Let's get you up to speed.

7
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.255
This is a story about the future.

8
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.174
And the future

9
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.214
<i>can be scary.</i>

10
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.451
<i>What?</i>

11
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.817
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go with "scary"?</i>


12
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.335
<i>Yes, I wanna go with scary.</i>

13
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.174
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>


14
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.457
<i>The future can be scary.</i>

15
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.617
<i>Unstable governments,
overpopulation,</i>


16
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.938
<i>wars on every continent,</i>

17
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.379
<i>famine, water shortages,
environmental collapse...</i>


18
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.613
<i>And scientific breakthroughs,
wonder and beauty...</i>


19
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.734
Could you please just stop interrupting?

20
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.733
I will. Just try to be
a little more upbeat.


21
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.221
- "Upbeat"?
- Yeah, tell them what you like...


22
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.736
I can't tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.


23
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.050
You're right. Sorry.

24
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.541
As I was saying...

25
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.491
<i>With every second
that ticks by, we get closer and closer...</i>


26
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.220
<i>I know. Tell them about when...</i>

27
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.611
<i>I can't tell them anything
until I tell them about this.</i>


28
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.017
<i>Then, can we please
just start somewhere else?</i>


29
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.411
Fine. Where would you like me to start?

30
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.733
Well, you keep saying the future
wasn't always this way, right?


31
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.892
It wasn't.
When I was a kid, the future was...


32
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.893
- Different, right?
- Yeah.


33
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.219
Okay, cool. Then, start there.

34
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.181
All right. Well, when I was a kid,
the future was different.


35
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.814
Flushing Meadows Corona Park,
World's Fair.


36
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.133
Don't forget your valuables
and enjoy the future.


37
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.259
Watch your step, kiddo.

38
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.292
- Hello, sir.
- May I help you?


39
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.091
My name is John Francis Walker.
I'm here to win the $50.


40
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.217
Is that so?

41
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.778
I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.


42
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.501
Seeing as how the bus ride
was kind of bumpy


43
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.379
and you know nitro.

44
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.491
I could've used
a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.


45
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.777
Bell Labs tested that
with their Rocket Belt


46
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.056
and I guess there were some issues

47
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.339
with maneuverability,
flight duration, and stuff.


48
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.611
It's a jet pack.

49
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.211
Obviously.

50
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.691
You made this yourself?

51
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.535
Athena, what are you doing here?

52
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.381
Did you or didn't you?

53
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.171
- What?
- Did you make this yourself?


54
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.291
Yeah.

55
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.857
Why?

56
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.816
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to do it for me.


57
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.776
Does it work?

58
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.301
Sure. Yeah.

59
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.577
Mostly.

60
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.017
Just doesn't really,
you know, technically...


61
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.340
...fly.

62
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.899
<i>"But if it did, " You know,</i>

63
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.450
"technically fly,"
what would its purpose be?


64
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.658
How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?


65
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.411
Can't it just be fun?

66
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.699
Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than "fun."


67
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.095
Anything's possible.

68
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.454
I don't know what that means.

69
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.850
If I was walking down the street,

70
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.661
and I saw some kid with
a jet pack fly over me,


71
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.573
I'd believe anything's possible.

72
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.015
I'd be inspired.

73
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.650
Doesn't that make
the world a better place?


74
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.335
Well, I suppose it would.

75
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.294
If it worked.

76
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.175
Unfortunately, it does not.

77
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.901
And if it doesn't work,
it has no purpose at all.


78
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.974
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.
- But I can make it work!


79
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.380
That's the spirit.

80
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.057
Until then, young man, have fun.

81
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.059
Absolutely not.

82
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.456
- I like him.
- Athena, no.


83
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.094
What makes you
think you're gonna make this thing fly?


84
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.501
I'm optimistic.

85
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.334
- You're wasting your time.
- I'm not!


86
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.016
- Damn contraption.
- It's not a contraption!


87
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.377
- It doesn't work.
- I can make it work.


88
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.815
No, you can't!

89
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.699
I'm not giving up.

90
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.612
Don't turn around. Be cool.

91
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.335
What did I just tell you?

92
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.378
- Sorry.
- Stop talking.


93
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.895
Look over there. Five o'clock.

94
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.101
You know, on a clock?

95
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.060
Where the five is.

96
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.214
That way.

97
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.771
I'm going with them.

98
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.537
You count to 20, then follow us.
Don't get spotted.


99
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.016
Who are you?

100
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.774
I'm the future, Frank Walker.

101
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.296
Nice. Do you like it?

102

Sorry, folks, you're gonna have
to wait for the next boat.

There'll be another boat
in just a minute.

Hey! That's mine!

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.574
Did you just fix it?

It works now.

132
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.417
So, what is this place?

133
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.891
<i>And then everything went to hell.</i>

134

<i>- Oh, boy.
- Well, it did.</i>


135
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.174
<i>So you gave them, like, one second
of blue skies and jet packs and hope...</i>


136
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.457
<i>It's important.
They need to know the stakes.</i>


137
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.340
<i>I think they can figure out
clocks counting down are bad.</i>


138
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.741
- Do you wanna tell the story?
- No, you're doing fine.


139
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.340
Because if you think
you can tell the story better,


140
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.617
I would absolutely love to hear you try.

141
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.573
- Really?
- Really.


142
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.977
I guess, technically,
I am more qualified.


143
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.941
Are you? How so?

144
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.699
Because, unlike you, 
I'm an optimist.

145
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.253
- Babe, you filming?
- It's video.


146
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.657
- I knew it!
- Are you videoing?


147
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.175
Okay. Go ahead, sweetie.

148
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.701
Do your thing, Casey.

149
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.693
That's Sirius.

That's Canopus.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.693
That's Arcturus.

152

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:32.616
Vega, Procyon, Capella, Betelgeuse.

154
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.296
And why do you love
the stars so much, Casey?


155
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.059
Because I wanna go there.

156
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.814
But it's so far away.

157
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.052
It'll take a long time. 
A real long time.

158
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.418
What if you get all the way up there,
and there's nothing?


159
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.821
What if there's everything?

160
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.255
<i>- Oh, boy.
- What?</i>


161
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.934
<i>Are you gonna go through
your entire childhood?</i>


162
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.331
<i>You started when you were a kid.
I'm just giving them context.</i>


163
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.219
<i>Just move it along. Okay?
They don't have all day.</i>


164
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.377
<i>Cool. You got it.</i>

165
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.055
Identify yourself!

166
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.370
Nate!

167
00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.851
If you wake up Dad, 
I will crush you.

168
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.173
You shouldn't sneak out.

169
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.691
Well, you shouldn't still need a wubby.

170
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.092
Dad says it's okay to sleep with.

171
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.457
That's because
he doesn't want you to grow up.


172
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.059
Were you at the platform again?

173
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.133
What do you do out there?

174
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.340
Are you trying to stop them
from taking it down?


175
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.580
That would make me a criminal.

176
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.857
And a pretty terrible role model

177
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.012
to impressionable youth
such as yourself.


178
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.820
But if someone else did it,

179
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.774
I'd have to assume they believed

180
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:50.579
even the teeniest of actions
could change the future.


181
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.619
How can you be sure?

182
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.371
Because I know how things work.

183
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.212
Why are they taking the platform down?

184
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.940
Because it's hard to have ideas
and easy to give up.


185
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.976
But you won't. Right?

186
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.895
Never.

187
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.892
Hey, Dad. Heading to school.

188
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.780
- I made you lunch.
- Hey!


189
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.295
Wrap it up.

190
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.530
- How did you do...
- You would have gotten it.


191
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.451
Yeah, Eddie Newton.

192
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.621
What?

193
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.779
All three cranes?

194
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.732
All right, Douglas.
Thanks for the call. Bye.


195
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.891
Everything okay?

196
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.052
Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral is down again.


197
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.338
- Weird.
- Really weird.


198
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.255
Well, at least you get the day off.

199
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.537
Actually, they're bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando,


200
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.817
so I will be
back to work by noon.

201
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.050
That's fantastic.

202
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.178
- Case.
- Yeah?


203
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.651
Nothing's gonna stop them
from taking down that platform.


204
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.333
Nothing. And when we're done,
I'm out of a job.


205
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.972
There's nothing anyone can do about it.
It's inevitable.


206
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.338
Well, then you'll find something else.
You're a NASA engineer.


207
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.853
With nothing to launch.

208
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.132
- There are two wolves.
- Case.


209
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.181
You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.


210
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.378
There are two wolves,
and they're always fighting.


211
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.012
One is darkness and despair.

212
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.216
The other is light and hope.

213
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.817
Which wolf wins?

214
00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.175
Come on, Case.

215
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.651
Okay. Fine, don't answer.

216
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.381
Whichever one you feed.

217
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.416
Good.

218
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.211
Eat.

219
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.856
Come on.

220
00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.651
Mutually assured destruction.

221
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:53.657
Today, any nuclear country or terrorist
is capable of inflicting damage


222
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.893
on a massive scale with weapons of...

223
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.979
Environmental entropy.

224
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.974
The polar ice caps
aren't waiting for us to decide


225
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.132
if climate change is real.

226
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.419
Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.


227
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.414
They're all punching
our one-way ticket to...


228
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.256
Dystopia. By definition, "not perfect."

229
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.412
Huxley's <i>Brave New World,</i>

230
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.777
Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i>

231
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.456
Orwell's <i>1984.</i>

232
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.931
Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels


233
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.854
are actually happening right now
and they seem to be getting worse.


234
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.091
Yes, Miss Newton?

235
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.695
Can we fix it?

236
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.651
Sorry?

237
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.059
I get things are bad.
But what are we doing to fix it?


238
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.452
Have a good weekend, everybody.

239
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.541
- Newton?
- Yeah.


240
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.738
You made bail.
Motorcycle is in impound.


241
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.256
You can pick up
your personal effects over there.


242
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.094
- Newton?
- Yeah.


243
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.617
All right.

244
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.815
All right.

245
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.861
Okay, one money clip, $47.32,

246
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.735
one Florida state driver's license,
one baseball cap.


247
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.813
You got one pin,

248
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.892
one pack of Beemans gum,
and I don't know what this is.


249
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.654
Sign here.

250
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.011
- That's not mine.
- What's not yours?


251
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.421
The pin. I've never...

252
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.052
No way.

253
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.220
Have I been here the whole time?

254
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.731
I know.

255
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.771
No!

256
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.251
I got it.

257
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.534
You have no idea
of the strings I had to pull


258
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.011
to keep Homeland Security
from pressing charges, Casey.


259
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.371
This is not just vandalism. All right?

260
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.977
- It's NASA. It's government property.
- Have you ever seen this before?


261
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.540
You're not getting it, are you?
I am very upset with you!


262
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.090
I get it, you're angry. I understand.

263
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.250
But I just need you to look at it.
Does it look weird?


264
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.416
- Don't touch it!
- Why are you yelling at me?


265
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.971
Not while you're driving, Dad.
It's dangerous.


266
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.620
Just pull over.

267
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.297
Pull over.

268
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.732
I swear to God, Case,
if you're on drugs...


269
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.461
I'm not on drugs. Just look.

270
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.579
I need you to be NASA Dad now.

271
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.574
New Frontier Dad. Okay?

272
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.334
All will be explained
as soon as you touch this pin.


273
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:31.451
What is...

274
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.700
It's not working?

275
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.931
You're not seeing this?

276
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.171
Stop it.

277
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.657
Honestly, Casey,
I don't know what's gotten into you.


278
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.579
Middle of the night...

279
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.691
- A little help, guys?
- Zen move, Dexter.


280
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.101
Totally swift.

281
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.053
Come on, idiots.
We're gonna be late for R and D.


282
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:54.576
<i>The HoverRail will be
arriving in one minute.</i>


283
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.254
- Are you coming?
- You can see me?


284
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.219
We don't have all day.

285
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.781
Wait for us!

286
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.661
<i>Northbound line now departing.</i>

287
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.497
<i>Next stop, Spaceport.</i>

288
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.172
Wow! Look at the rings!

289
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.373
Wow! Cool!

290
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.771
Be sure to follow the procedures strictly.

291
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.579
You know how you need your sleep.

292
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.220
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

293
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.373
- Do you promise to transmit every day?
- Even when you're out of range.


294
00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:37.818
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're only going 20 light-years out.


295
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.977
<i>Now arriving, 
Spaceport.</i>

296
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.581
Come on, please.

297
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.251
I'll be okay.

298
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.650
Hey, guys. Over here.

299
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:28.896
- Hey!
- Hey!


300
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.777
Come on, please! 
I love you guys.

301
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.013
You're going to make me cry in
front of my friends, okay?


302
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.934
Bye! Bye!

303
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.421
Come on. We saved
a seat just for you.

304
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.371
Now you run out of power?

305
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.376
- Nate, wake up!
- I didn't do it!


306
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.730
Dad changed
the password to his computer.


307
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.141
Do you know it?

308
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.379
You smell like swamp.

309
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.339
Tell me the password
and you can go back to sleep.


310
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.900
Your phone has Internet.

311
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.341
- My phone got soaked in a lagoon.
- Fine.


312
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.492
What are we looking for?

313
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.452
Here we go.

314
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.937
Stop! That's it.

315
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.932

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.341
Okay. Give me their number.

321
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.856
- They don't have a number.
- They don't have a number?


322
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.614
They have an address.

323
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.411
Okay, look. You are gonna
tell Dad you woke up, saw me leaving.


324
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.778
I told you I was going camping with
friends, and I will call tomorrow.


325
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.740
- Can you do that for me?
- Only if you tell me what's going on.


326
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.093
I think that I saw...

327
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.176
That I went to the future.

328
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.770
Can I come, too?

329
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.412
Not yet.

330
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.297
Hello! Is Casey Newton home?

331
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.376
No.

332
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.658
She ordered some cookies
and I'm delivering them.


333
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.420
- You're a Girl Scout?
- Of course I am.


334
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.494
- Why aren't you wearing a uniform?
- It's at the cleaners.


335
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.698
Those are Oreos.

336
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.092
Could you please tell me
when Casey will be back?


337
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.975
She went camping with some friends.

338
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.098
She's gonna be gone
for a couple of days.


339
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.531
Is that what you've told your parents?

340
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.699
- Yeah.
- But it's not true.


341
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.092
- Yeah, it is.
- No, Nathan. It's not.


342
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.659
Don't ask me how I know your name.

343
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.257
I know it the same way
I know that you are lying to me.


344
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.259
Are you from the future?

345
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.214
You clearly understand.

346
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.456
So why aren't you
telling me what I need to know?


347
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.980
That pin thing, it stopped working.

348
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.939
She went to find another one.

349
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.456
Nathan, where is she looking?

350
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:10.378
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>


351
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.336
Hello?

352
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.976
Sale this week.
Front three shelves. 70% off.


353
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.257
No, thanks.
I'm not here to buy anything.


354
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.531
I was hoping that
you could tell me about this.


355
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.137
Hugo!

356
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.896
Hugo!

357
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.337
One second.

358
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.253
Welcome to Blast From The...

359
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.816
Thank you for the help, dear.

360
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.574
Well, if you just kept it open,
you wouldn't need my help.


361
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.652
If I kept it open, it would ruin
the effect, which is everything.


362
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.619
Pardon my wife.
She has no respect for showmanship.


363
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.216
- Hugo Gernsback. How may I help you?
- She has a pin.


364
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.379
She has a pin.

365
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.340
I saw that you were
looking for one online...


366
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.141
- Where did you get it?
- What can you tell me about it?


367
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.736
I can't tell you anything about it
unless you tell me who gave it to you.


368
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.181
I'm not going first.

369
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.211
Well, it seems
our business here is done.


370
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.295
It seems it is.

371
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.499
Saw something, didn't you?

372
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.739
When you touched it.

373
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.578
Something incredible.

374
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.971
- It's real?
- Of course it is.


375
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.421
Don't ask me how.

376
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.050
These people have
developed technologies


377
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.774
we haven't even dreamed of yet.

378
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.371
Wait. What people?

379
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.101
Have you ever wondered
what would happen


380
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.970
if all the geniuses,
the artists, the scientists,


381
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.850
the smartest,
most creative people in the world,


382
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.774
decided to actually change it?

383
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.615
But where?

384
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.059
Where could they
even do such a thing?


385
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.577
They'd need a place
free from politics and bureaucracy,


386
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.017
distractions, greed.

387
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.412
A secret place where they could build

388
00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.255
whatever they were
crazy enough to imagine.


389
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.380
"Plus Ultra" they call themselves.

390
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.614
The only way to see it, however,
is through contact with one of these.


391
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.454
Why did they make them?
What are they for?


392
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.175
Rumor has it

393
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.332
- they were about to go public.
- Yeah.


394
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.891
Share what they had built
with the whole world.


395
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.133
Unfortunately, that never happened.

396
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.531
Why not?

397
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.180
I think we've shared enough,
young lady.


398
00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.211
So, as we've decided to trust you,

399
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.858
please trust us
and tell me where'd you get it?


400
00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.931
I don't know.

401
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.061
What do you mean, honey?

402
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.972
I kind of got arrested
and it was in with my stuff.


403
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.937
- In with your stuff?
- Yeah, I don't know how it got there.


404
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.696
What was that?

405
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:27.576
- Tell us who gave it to you. Please.
- No one gave it to me!


406
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.413
That's very unlikely, sweetheart.

407
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.581
You know what?

408
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.493
I think I'm gonna go now.
Thanks for your help.


409
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.497
$1,000 if you tell me
where you acquired the pin.


410
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:42.617
I don't know!

411
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.692
- $10,000.
- Was it a girl? A little girl?


412
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.579
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.


413
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.618
Have a nice day. 
Enjoy your freak out.

414
00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.131
Tell us where she is
and you will be spared.


415
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.655
This is a joke, right?

416
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.181
Where's the girl?

417
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.697
I don't... I don't know about...

418
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.376
You will tell us about the girl.

419
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.215
I don't know any girl. I told you...

420
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:49.133
- Where is the girl?
- I don't know any girl!


421
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.251
We have to go!

422
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.860
Come on. Now!

423
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.901
This is a time bomb.
It stops time, but not for long!


424
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.251
- What?
- Listen to me.


425
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.857
The sphere is collapsing
and you're in the line of fire.


426
00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:20.059
We need to go or you will die.

427
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:23.815
I'm stuck!

428
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.095
- I'm stuck!
- But only temporarily.


429
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.538
Take my hand. The moment you're free,
I'll pull you clear.


430
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.055
Then stay behind me.

431
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.417
Ready?

432
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.491
The girl.

433
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.051
Look out!

434
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.571
We have to go.

435
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.055
They're about to self-destruct.
We have to go now!


436
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.498
Crazy enough to imagine.
Crazy enough to imagine.


437
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.976
Casey, get up.

438
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.215
They'll be coming.

439
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.099
What? Who?

440
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.331
- I don't know what... I can't get into...
- I know, I know.


441
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.060
Get in the car, Casey!

442
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.220
How do you know my name?

443
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.254
Just get in the car.

444
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:36.971
What just happened?

445
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.530
Two AA units targeted you
for extermination.


446
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.017
I saved your life. 
They self-destructed.

447
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.091
Wait. "AAs"?

448
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.890
Audio
-Animatronics.

449
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:49.100
- They were robots?
- No. Advanced anthropomo...


450
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.501
Sure. Okay. Robots.

451
00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.139
Wait, wait. Who are you?

452
00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:01.417
My name is Athena.
I'm the one who gave you the pin.


453
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.858
The pin? The pin!

454
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.417
Yes. And I do
wish you hadn't run off

455
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.494
before I had a chance to give you
some rather necessary context.


456
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.937
Context? What are you
even talking about?


457
00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:14.695
How are you driving a car?
Who are you?


458
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.973
<i>I'm a cruder.</i>

459
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.375
<i>Re... I'm a recruton.</i>

460
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.419
<i>60 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

461
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:38.253
So sorry about that.

462
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.734
- You're one of them?
- Obviously.


463
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.091
Where are you going?
Stop! I'm trying to help you!


464
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.940
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

465
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.457
Hey!

466
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:18.897
Hey!

467
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.773
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.


468
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.180
No way!

469
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.775
- Let me out of this car!
- Stop yelling!


470
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.461
- Let me out now!
- No! I will not!


471
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.897
I gave you my
very last pin, young lady,

472
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.052
and I am not about
to let it go to waste.

473
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.577
What do you mean your last pin?

474
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.740
Wait, that place I saw...

475
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.180
- It exists?
- Of course it does.


476
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.571
But if you don't come with me,
it won't for much longer.


477
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:19.251
Why not?

478
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.250
Because they built something
they shouldn't have.


479
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.139
Built what?

480
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.134
Do you want to keep
asking me questions


481
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.941
- until someone arrives to murder us?
- No.


482
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.817
Then which way do you want to go?

483
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.411
Backwards or forwards?

484
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.461
- And you can take me there?
- I can.


485
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:45.211
I'm driving.

486
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.094
Okie-dokie.
You fellas are released. Thanks.


487
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:53.175
Alrighty, boys.

488
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.053
Fire chief says
we're clear to go in and poke around.


489
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.541
Hopefully, they were out for lunch

490
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.692
and nobody was in
there when she went boom.


491
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.937
Captain.

492
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.261
Afternoon, sir.
Dave Clark, Secret Service.


493
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.732
Looks like you got
yourself a doozy here.


494
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.541
Secret Service?
Hey, where are they going?


495
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:20.810
They're securing the premises.

496
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:24.138
Thanks so much for your help,
but we're going to take it from here.


497
00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.773
Hey, Dale.
I found this just outside the window.


498
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.099
You ever seen anything like it?

499
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.095
What the hell?

500
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.016
God almighty!

501
00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.855
<i>Sale. This week. 70 perce...</i>

502
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.657
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?
Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>


503
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.851
You wanna tell me
what's going on here, son?


504
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.171
No, sir. I do not.

505
00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.860
<i>Was it a girl? 
A little girl?</i>

506
00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.134
Contact Governor Nix.

507
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.180
Tell him we found the girl.

508
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:03.851
Veer left!

509
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.338
Little more of a heads up next time.

510
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.970
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
just tell me where we're going?


511
00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:13.054
- Pittsfield, New York.
- What's in Pittsfield, New York?


512
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.181
Someone who can get us back in.

513
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.654
Hold on.
You said that you gave me your last pin.


514
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.539
How many other people
did you give them to?


515
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.611
Not important.

516
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.855
I'm not even your first choice.

517
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.732
I only found you
a month ago when you started


518
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.057
wantonly destroying
government property.


519
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.211
Which happens to go

520
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.054
on my search parameters
for recruitment.


521
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:37.179
Not to mention you scored a 73
on the Feynman/Drummelberg scale.


522
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.935
73? Is that good?

523
00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.491
Wait. Hold on. 
Recruitment for what?

524
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.015
I'm not allowed to answer that.

525
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.376
Who's not allowing you?

526
00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.817
I'm not allowed to answer that.
And I should warn you,


527
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:51.451
you keep asking me questions, and my
Countermeasure Protocol will initiate.


528
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.296
- Okay. And what does that mean?
- I will shut down.


529
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.734
- You will not.
- Try me.


530
00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:06.057
You said that they built
something they shouldn't have.


531
00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:08.974
Did something happen over there?
Something bad?


532
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.497
Son of a...

533
00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.612
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.


534
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.692
<i>Hey, you've reached
Eddie Newton's cell phone.</i>


535
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.296
<i>Leave me a message
and I will call you back.</i>


536
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.133
Hey, Dad. It's Casey.

537
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.133
I told Nate to tell you that I was
camping, but I'm not camping.


538
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:46.258
And I just don't like lying to you.

539
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.260
But I didn't know
how to tell you the truth because...


540
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:56.496
Something highly unusual
is happening, and...


541
00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.100
Okay. My point is...

542
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.940
<i>I'm fine. I will continue to be fine.</i>

543
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:06.498
<i>I'm not on drugs. 
I haven't joined a cult.</i>

544
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:07.936
<i>I won't be gone long.</i>

545
00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:12.690
<i>And I will call again soon.
I love you, Dad.</i>


546
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:20.941
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

547
00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.178
Yes. Fine, thank you.

548
00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.496
I thought I broke you or something.

549
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.331
I should drive.

550
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:37.012
Casey, I know you have
no reason to trust me.


551
00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:40.697
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.


552
00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:42.651
Now, please,

553
00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:45.651
pull over.

554
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.140
Of all the people
you could give one of those pins to,


555
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:02.891
Why me?

556
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.055
Because you're special.

557
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:09.416
- Yeah. I'm special.
- You are.


558
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.132
So, this guy we're gonna go see,

559
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.340
what's his name?

560
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:27.221
His name is Frank.

561
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.613
<i>Frank Walker.</i>

562
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.420
He's special, too.

563
00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.617
Frank Walker.

564
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.534
Hey! Wait, what are you doing?

565
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.100
Just great.

566
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:24.934
Where are your paw prints?

567
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:40.377
That is cool.

568
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:12.972
I can hear you, you know.

569
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:15.576
Go away. Didn't you see the dog?

570
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.417
Yeah. It's a hologram.

571
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.492
How did you do that in daylight?

572
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:22.973
- It's pretty impressive.
- Who are you?


573
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:24.415
What do you want?

574
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.413
You're Frank Walker, right?

575
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.301
My name's Casey,
and I want you to take me there.


576
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.098
Take you where?

577
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.730
To the place I
saw when I touched this.

578
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.056
Where'd you get this?

579
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.457
A little girl. Athena.

580
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:00.296
Where is she?

581
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:02.101
She ditched me here.

582
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.535
Of course she did.

583
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.932
Look, wherever you came from, kid,
go back.


584
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:12.101
No, I want you to take me there.
What I saw...


585
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.457
What you saw is gone.

586
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.494
This, what you're looking for,
it doesn't exist anymore.


587
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:22.575
No. I feel like I have to go.
Like I'm supposed to go.


588
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.890
Why?

589
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:27.213
Because they're saving
a seat on the rocket ship just for you?


590
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.897
What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded decades ago.


591
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:36.896
It was an invitation that never went out
because the damn party got canceled.


592
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.057
You are not supposed to do anything.

593
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:44.575
You've been manipulated to feel
like you're part of something incredible.


594
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:46.741
Like you were special.

595
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:48.656
But you weren't.

596
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:51.531
You're not.

597
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.651
So that's a no?

598
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.297
Son of a...

599
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:45.541
You little...

600
01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:51.097
<i>You know, I can call the cops anytime.</i>

601
01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.450
Anytime!

602
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.975
You have...
I'm giving you five seconds...


603
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.132
I am not leaving!

604
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.577
Either tell me how to
get there or kill me!


605
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:16.059
If you touch anything in there,
that's exactly what I'll do!


606
01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.816
What are you doing?

607
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:21.938
I'm touching things!

608
01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.098
Open this door now!

609
01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:31.496
I mean it. I'll knock you out.

610
01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:40.656
Hey, what's this doohickey
with the trombone slidey thing?


611
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.573
Leave that alone. I'm serious!

612
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:45.417
- Will you take me there?
- No!


613
01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:47.219
Then you're not serious!

614
01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:52.491
Come on.

615
01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.335
You didn't think that was funny?

616
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.219
You're recording this?

617
01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.851
If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,
have it for posterity.


618
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:02.930
I laughed.

619
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.331
You smiled. A smile's not a laugh.

620
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.620
Everyone laughs. 
It's a biological need.

621
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.933
Actually, it isn't.
Sleep is a biological need.


622
01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.012
I've never seen you sleep, either.

623
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.976
Well, sooner or later,
I'm gonna make you laugh.


624
01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:22.090
Until you do, I'm not gonna stop trying.

625
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.214
Maybe you should.

626
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.531
What?

627
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:28.974
Stop trying.

628
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:32.976
Why?

629
01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.854
Must we record this?

630
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:38.100
- Get out!
- Wait a second.


631
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.019
What is that? Is that a countdown?

632
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:42.451
I am not leaving. I deserve to
know what's going on around here.


633
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.419
- You deserve...
- Yeah, I deserve some answers.


634
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:46.254
- Answers to what?
- I know that you were there.


635
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.456
You don't know anything.

636
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.180
How do you ever
leave a place like that?


637
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.581
Because they threw me out!

638
01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.132
They threw me out
and they locked every door back in.


639
01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:06.451
Was it because you built
that something that you shouldn't have?


640
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.816
Who told you that?

641
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:09.571
And is that it?

642
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.494
The "something"?

643
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:17.493
If I could tell you the date,

644
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.219
the exact date that you're gonna die,
would you wanna know?


645
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:23.936
- How would you know?
- Let's just say I did.


646
01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.774
- What are you, a psychic?
- No, that's not the point.


647
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.090
Then what is your basis for knowing?

648
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.615
- It's a hypothetical.
- It's a stupid hypothetical.


649
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.216
Just use your imagination. All right?

650
01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.410
- All right.
- Okay.


651
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.580
Let's accept that there is a world

652
01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:40.895
where I know, with absolute certainty,
the exact time of your death.


653
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.171
Now, you want me
to tell you or not?

654
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.853
Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?

655
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:54.492
But what if accepting my death
is what causes it?


656
01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.173
So the answer is yes.
I would want you to tell me.


657
01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.978
- But I wouldn't believe you.
- You have to believe me.


658
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:03.860
Why? Don't we, like,
make our own destiny and stuff?


659
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:12.856
What?

660
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:21.541
Who are you, kid?

661
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.495
Is that bad?

662
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:31.777
Hell.

663
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:34.051
Hell!

664
01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.180
- They followed you here?
- What? Who?


665
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:49.891
Robots.

666
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:52.655
I've never seen them before.

667
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.413
<i>John Francis Walker.</i>

668
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:56.571
<i>You have been permitted to live</i>

669
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.618
<i>based upon your
agreed non-intervention.</i>


670
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.011
<i>You are now harboring
a fugitive element.</i>


671
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.411
<i>Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.</i>


672
01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:06.012
<i>You have one minute to comply.</i>

673
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.455
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.


674
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:43.497
Wait.

675
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:52.011
Come on!

676
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:15.977
Let's go!

677
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:25.141
John Francis Walker,
by authority of Governor Nix,


678
01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:26.655
this unit has been authorized

679
01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:27.970
<i>to extinguish your life.</i>

680
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:33.536
Okay.

681
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:39.170
Okay.

682
01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:43.652
All right, that's enough. 
That's enough!

683
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:49.139
Come on. Close the door.

684
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.974
Who the hell is Governor Nix?

685
01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:54.980
Let's go. Come on.

686
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.261
Get in.

687
01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.300
How is this a good idea?

688
01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:36.981
Move or sink, kid.

689
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.178
You were actually prepared for that?

690
01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.659
- My hat.
- Leave it.


691
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.340
No, no, no. I can't go without it.

692
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.331
It's my dad's.

693
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.694
Now I get it.

694
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:06.012
Too smart for your own good.

695
01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:10.577
Father never understood you,
never supported you.


696
01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:15.497
And now you wear
his hat as a badge of rebellion, right?


697
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.171
No. My dad is amazing.

698
01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:24.898
Wait a second.

699
01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:27.853
We're not talking about me, are we?

700
01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:33.535
Why don't we just get you
to your amazing dad


701
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.021
and pretend this never happened?

702
01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:37.011
Hop on.

703
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:41.614
- The battery's dead.
- No, it's not.


704
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:44.136
- Then maybe it's the points.
- No, it's not.


705
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:47.578
- When's the last time you checked...
- You know, you're not helping. You...


706
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:50.895
Get down. Now.

707
01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:06.811
Wait.

708
01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.131
Hello, Frank.

709
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:20.494
Are you going to shoot me?

710
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.500
- I'm deciding.
- Could you decide in the truck?


711
01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:27.413
Because we really should get going.

712
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:32.732
- Wait.
- Why? So more robots can show up?


713
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.616
She's one of them.

714
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:38.539
Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

715
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:46.620
Move over.

716
01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:08.494
- Frank...
- Not yet.


717
01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:12.661
What are you thinking?
Why would you drag her into this?


718
01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:16.371
I didn't drag her into anything.
I gave her a pin.


719
01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.781
She did the rest.

720
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:19.731
Just like you.

721
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:23.337
Don't even.
Where did you even find the pin?


722
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:24.900
I was there. They destroyed 'em.

723
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:28.053
Not all of them.
I made it out with nearly a dozen.


724
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:29.575
So you give one to a teenager.

725
01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:33.052
Hey, I got a 73 on the
Feinberg/Dusseldorf scale or whatever.


726
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.417
You got a 73?
That's not possible.


727
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.731
He's jealous because he scored a 41.

728
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:40.893
You know what? I
was 11. I was 11!

729
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:43.332
Hey, don't touch that!

730
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:47.893
This is a one-kiloton detonation.
It is not a toy.


731
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.217
Do not mess with my stuff.

732
01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:51.416
- You got it?
- Sorry!


733
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:54.061
I didn't begin with her, you know.

734
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.940
I wasted years
on other potential candidates.


735
01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:58.660
Potential candidates? For what?

736
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:02.330
That's beautiful.

737
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.697
You still think
you're recruiting, don't you?


738
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:06.374
Do not ask her any more questions.

739
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.259
She's gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.


740
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:09.730
What countermeasure shutdown thing?

741
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.579
Did you tell her you had
a countermeasure shutdown thing?


742
01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:15.257
- She was annoying me.
- You lied?


743
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:16.701
Get used to that, kid.

744
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:18.770
One minute,
she's promising you a beautiful future,


745
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:21.575
the next thing you know,
she's leading it to your house to kill you.


746
01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:24.620
I'm sorry, but time is running out
and you needed motivation.


747
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:25.737
Motivation for what?

748
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:29.215
- We need to go back over, Frank.
- Back over there?


749
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:31.454
Yes, yes, Frank,
we need to go back over.


750
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.055
Good. Great. That's just great.

751
01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:36.777
You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.
Let's jump on the hive.


752
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:38.540
That's a terrible analogy.

753
01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:41.295
That's a fantastic analogy.
What do you know about analogies?


754
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.611
You know, you're impossible to talk
to when you're like this.


755
01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:47.132
I am like this because
you derailed my life.


756
01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:48.291
Again.

757
01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.850
Frank, it's not personal.

758
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:52.851
It's just programming.

759
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.217
We're here!

760
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:04.811
Where are you going?

761
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.894
This is where
your wire station's located, isn't it?


762
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:09.654
We need to get to The Spectacle.

763
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:12.097
- Spectacle?
- Hey. Are you insane?


764
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:14.650
They know that you sent her to me.
They're gonna be waiting for us.


765
01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:17.574
Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and we'll go without you.


766
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:20.699
- I don't have the Edison tube.
- It's in your bag.


767
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:23.259
I have x-ray vision.

768
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:26.220
- When did you get x-ray vision?
- She's full of surprises.


769
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:27.655
I know all about her surprises.

770
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.973
Chief among them is this.
She doesn't care about you.


771
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:35.456
All that charm and the sense
of purpose, and the cute little smile,


772
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:37.180
it's all just software.

773
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.617
It's ones and zeroes. That's it.

774
01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:43.780
Trust me, when you get there,
you're on your own.


775
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:48.218
- What happened to you two?
- He thinks I hurt him.


776
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:51.772
No, you hurt a dumb kid
that was stupid enough to fall...


777
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:58.893
You were many things, Frank Walker.

778
01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.694
But you were never dumb.

779
01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:10.939
Why don't you just give me
the Edison tube, and...


780
01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:13.092
I'm not giving you anything. I'm...

781
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.655
All right.

782
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:23.540
You want in? I'll bring you in.

783
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:25.055
Why not?

784
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:27.019
It's better than waiting
around here and getting


785
01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:29.058
hunted and killed, etcetera, etcetera.

786
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:32.697
- That's the spirit.
- "Etcetera"? What's the "etcetera"?


787
01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:59.939
- What kind of cables are these?
- The kind that transmit people.


788
01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:01.616
People? Like us?

789
01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:04.934
- What, like a miniature teleport...
- Do I have to explain everything?


790
01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:08.772
Can't you just be amazed and move on?

791
01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.535
This is all wired
to the dish up there.

792
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:16.853
Are you... Are you using satellite?

793
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:20.621
I know how things work.

794
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.260
Well, zippity-doo for you.

795
01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:28.532
- Wrap this around your eyes, tight.
- Why?


796
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:30.612
Because justice is blind.

797
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.732
Just do it, kid.

798
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:37.574
You want me to
put this over my head?

799
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:40.300
If this takes off my eyebrows...

800
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:42.452
Shut up, open your mouth,
tilt your head back.


801
01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:45.061
What is that?

802
01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:47.779
It's powder. Are we at van 't Hoff?

803
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.775
Good to go!

804
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:53.741
Good. You set it for the Tower?
There is still a receiver there?


805
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.938
- Last I checked.
- How long ago was that?


806
01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:01.096
25 years ago.

807
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.610
Roughly.

808
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.057
They threw you out, too?

809
01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:15.091
Okay, guys. Killer robots.

810
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.211
All right.

811
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:19.975
It's gonna be
bright, cold, and really loud.


812
01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:22.621
You're gonna lose

813
01:17:22.690 --> 01:17:23.930
in 1/100th of a second

814
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:26.934
and you're gonna wish you were dead.
But then it'll be over.


815
01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:29.975
Don't pee on us.

816
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.291
This sounds spectacular.

817
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.498
Why now? Why her?

818
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.299
Because she hasn't given up.

819
01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:41.020
You think she can fix it.

820
01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:44.019
What makes you say that?

821
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:48.136
Can she, Athena?

822
01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:50.256
I have no idea.

823
01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:53.779
Let's go find out.

824
01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:09.572
Is it... Is this normal?

825
01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:31.581
Thirsty.

826
01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:33.937
Dying. I think I'm dying.

827
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:36.092
- You're not dying!
- I'm dying.


828
01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:37.934
There's Coke in the fridge.

829
01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:57.541
Help yourself.

830
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:00.621
We have no idea how many are here

831
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.135
but we're damn sure
they know we're coming.


832
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:04.258
So, we move quickly. 
You follow me.

833
01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:06.219
No questions. Got it?

834
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.531
Got it.

835
01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:18.131
Excuse me.

836
01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:43.493
- We're in Paris?
- Would you stop being so amazed?


837
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:46.779
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed.
- I want you to stop yammer...


838
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.380
- Tower's closing.
- Hell.


839
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.131
Come on.

840
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:04.812
Now, you and I are gonna be
on a watch list,


841
01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:07.973
but they may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.


842
01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:09.176
- "May not"?
- May not.


843
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:12.652
So, you walk over there,
you take this, you tap him on the neck.


844
01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:15.779
- If he's human, it knocks him right out.
- And if it's a robot?


845
01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:18.932
- Hey!
- You'll just piss it off.


846
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:20.656
Fantastic.

847
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:26.172
She's got guts. 
You gotta give her that.

848
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.777
Yes, but I was just, you know...

849
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:34.621
Human!

850
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:53.690
The French hated
this thing when Eiffel first unveiled it


851
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:55.061
at the Paris World's Fair.

852
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:56.655
They thought it was an eyesore.

853
01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:59.574
Eiffel didn't care, though.
It wasn't meant to be a monument.


854
01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:01.050
It was meant to find another world.

855
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.895
<i>Les Quatre Premiers.</i>
Plus Ultra's First Four.


856
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:07.415
They were a part of all this?

857
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:12.291
Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla,
and Mr. Edison.


858
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.536
They designed this antenna
that we're inside.


859
01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:17.499
Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower is an antenna?


860
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:19.413
Now I finally answer your question,
you're gonna interrupt me?


861
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:20.931
Yes.

862
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.332
Tesla designed the antenna to observe
every kind of frequency out there.


863
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:26.856
Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.


864
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:29.615
And they found exactly
what they were looking for.


865
01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:31.533
And then Edison tried
to take credit for it,


866
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:32.850
because these two hate each other.

867
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.261
- Frank...
- Because of alternating...


868
01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:35.695
Stay on topic.

869
01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.535
Yeah. All right, well...

870
01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:43.060
There were always rumors
of a secret entrance


871
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.696
the Four kept just for themselves.

872
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:51.214
A one-way ticket
in case of emergencies.


873
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:56.891
The Spectacle.

874
01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:31.574
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

875
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:38.815
It's a rocket.

876
01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:44.656
They're coming.

877
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:46.817
All right.

878
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.410
Buckle up!

879
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.456
- What'd he say?
- Pretty much what you'd expect.


880
01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:27.816
Tell him to hang on.

881
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:40.696
Why are we going back?

882
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:44.331
We're not. We're going through
to another dimension.


883
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:47.374
So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?


884
01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:49.773
This part may get a little weird.

885
01:26:45.730 --> 01:26:48.336
<i>Casey. Wake up.</i>

886
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:52.459
Casey.

887
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:57.336
- Casey. Wake up.
- We're here.


888
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:45.371
Now what?

889
01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:47.936
You tell me.

890
01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:52.059
- I tell you? This was your idea.
- I don't have ideas.


891
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:54.379
I just find the people who do.

892
01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:56.134
- So there's no plan?
- There's a plan.


893
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:57.900
You just haven't come up with it yet.

894
01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:01.052
But you should do that soon.

895
01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:07.019
That's just terrific.

896
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.931
Here, hide this.

897
01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:11.975
Absolutely.

898
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:14.212
Wait. Is that
the one-kiloton detonation thingy


899
01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.576
you told me not to play with?

900
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.981
Right now, it's our insurance policy.

901
01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:19.451
There's a good chance they're gonna
try to kill us right out of the gate.


902
01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:21.692
So we're just gonna stand here?

903
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:24.501
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

904
01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:26.855
Here it comes.

905
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.410
Take the bag.

906
01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:02.891
- Frank.
- David.


907
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:04.771
You look well.

908
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.456
Age becomes you.

909
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:08.301
Thanks. You should try it.

910
01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:11.895
I don't know. I think I'll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.


911
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:14.657
- Comes in chocolate now.
- Yum.


912
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:19.776
Hello, Athena.

913
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:22.050
I started to think
you were never coming home.


914
01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:24.860
Where, oh, where have you been?

915
01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:27.851
Your job?

916
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:29.855
I'm sorry. Were we not clear

917
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:32.098
when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?


918
01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:34.776
I got that sense when you
called me "bloody obsolete"


919
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:36.335
and tried to disassemble me.

920
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:40.501
Well, you've certainly
caused quite a commotion


921
01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:44.131
by launching an antique rocket ship
out of the Eiffel Tower.


922
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:47.374
Under normal circumstances,

923
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:50.852
we'd be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax.


924
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:55.140
Fortunately, for all of us,
doesn't really matter now, does it?


925
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:56.856
Why doesn't it matter?

926
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.141
And who might you be?

927
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:04.330
I'm Casey. Newton.

928
01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:07.899
And who might you be?

929
01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:10.215
David Nix.

930
01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:12.257
Pleasure.

931
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:15.257
Well, Frank, it's been
wonderful catching up,


932
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:18.573
but as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile


933
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:20.698
and the consequences of violating it,

934
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:23.859
I have to ask
what the hell are you doing here?


935
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.455
I think she can fix it.

936
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.298
- I'm sorry.
- Her.


937
01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:34.335
- I think she can fix it, David.
- Wait. What?


938
01:30:34.450 --> 01:30:35.690
I've been pirating your signal.

939
01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:38.620
Every time you turn it on here,
I can see it there.


940
01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:40.374
And it flickered.

941
01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:42.452
The percentage dropped, David.

942
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.451
Impossible.

943
01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:46.850
You don't believe me?
Let's go find out right now.


944
01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:50.816
- I'm sorry, what can I fix?
- The world, Miss Newton.


945
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:54.730
He thinks you can fix the world.

946
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:20.781
Is that like a portal to Earth?

947
01:31:21.370 --> 01:31:24.135
No. It is a bridgeway to Earth.

948
01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:32.610
Welcome back to The Monitor, Frank.

949
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:35.574
It's something, isn't it?

950
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:37.810
Yeah, it's something.

951
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.493
Don't worry about the light show.

952
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:58.335
It's perfectly safe.

953
01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:03.651
Am I supposed to do something?

954
01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:06.014
Okay, could you be a bit more specific?

955
01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:07.770
Because fixing
the world sounds a little...


956
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:09.460
Just be yourself.

957
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:11.821
Gotcha.

958
01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:16.294
Flashes of the future.

959
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:19.853
- What are those?
- Flashes of future.


960
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.419
This is us a few seconds from now.

961
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:26.981
This whole tower
funnels energy via tachyon,


962
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:29.417
a particle that
moves significantly faster than light.


963
01:32:29.490 --> 01:32:32.141
We discovered them
almost 40 years ago.


964
01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:35.293
Your physicists
are still arguing over whether they exist.


965
01:32:35.370 --> 01:32:36.451
Oh, dear.

966
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:38.537
Too late.

967
01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:40.135
Oh, dear.

968
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:41.691
Too late.

969
01:32:58.210 --> 01:32:59.894
So, on with the show.

970
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:03.338
We've enhanced
the interface significantly


971
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:06.220
but it still functions
on your original algorithm.


972
01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:09.892
You have something
to show me, Frank?


973
01:33:10.690 --> 01:33:11.771
Show me.

974
01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:24.936
Pick a place.

975
01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:28.378
- What?
- A location anywhere in the world.


976
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:29.576
Pick one.

977
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:32.491
Canaveral.

978
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:35.061
Cape Canaveral.

979
01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:50.256
Easy, easy.

980
01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:55.174
The interface is oriented from
your hands to the center of the Earth.


981
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:57.692
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

982
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:04.455
You trained her obviously.

983
01:34:05.130 --> 01:34:06.780
I just met her yesterday.

984
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:09.180
She knows how things work.

985
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:17.138
<i>You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.</i>


986
01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:18.700
How is this possible?

987
01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:21.535
We are millions
of exponential deviances.


988
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:24.056
Away from the dimension you call home.

989
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:26.531
Frank had the novel idea
of building this machine


990
01:34:26.610 --> 01:34:28.931
so that we could keep in touch.

991
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:31.855
This is three days ago.

992
01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:33.735
Relatively.

993
01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:37.451
That's space/time humor.

994
01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:43.413
Because tachyons
travel faster than light,


995
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:44.895
once we harness them...

996
01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:46.859
You can see backwards in time.

997
01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:49.176
Not just backwards.

998
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:52.611
You're kidding.

999
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:54.811
No.

1000
01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:21.135
What happened?

1001
01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:22.610
Keep going.

1002
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:25.134
Just a little further.

1003
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:12.857
That's enough.

1004
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:16.461
That's enough, kid.

1005
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:23.536
That's my house.

1006
01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:28.098
It would have been nice if Frank
had prepared you for this,


1007
01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:31.136
but I'm afraid the world is ending.

1008
01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:36.371
It is certain, it is unavoidable,
and it is coming.


1009
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:38.091
When?

1010
01:36:39.810 --> 01:36:41.414
This is 58 days from now.

1011
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:44.139
58 days?

1012
01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:48.257
But whatever caused this could happen
any time after the static starts.


1013
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:50.014
It could be a month.

1014
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:51.580
It could be sooner.

1015
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:02.778
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

1016
01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:04.771
I know what I saw.

1017
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:09.216
So why aren't you telling anyone?

1018
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:13.773
The whole planet is gonna die
and you're just sitting here?


1019
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:15.821
We're not gonna die.

1020
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.214
This is your world, not ours.

1021
01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:20.294
We'll be perfectly fine here.

1022
01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:22.737
Then why don't you let people in?

1023
01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:26.814
- Tell her, David.
- Frank.


1024
01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:31.452
All those years in exile,
and you still don't understand.


1025
01:37:31.530 --> 01:37:34.136
These people are driven by savagery.

1026
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:37.096
If we told them about this place,

1027
01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:41.578
then that would happen here to us.

1028
01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:42.981
Then nothing would survive.

1029
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:45.491
But it hasn't happened yet!

1030
01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:48.096
Actually, it has happened.
You just haven't accepted it.


1031
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:49.501
Well, I don't accept it!

1032
01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:59.177
Did you see that? 
Did you see that?

1033
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.900
David, I know that you saw that.

1034
01:38:00.970 --> 01:38:03.541
That means that there is a chance.
There's at least a chance...


1035
01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.259
That went quite well, don't you think?

1036
01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:16.061
- What happened?
- You're being deported.


1037
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:18.781
Again.

1038
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.616
Well, that's Nix for you.

1039
01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:23.931
No new ideas.

1040
01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:27.412
Apparently, your

1041
01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:30.061
wasn't convincing enough
to change his mind.


1042
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:37.175
Be gentle.

1043
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.455
You okay?

1044
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:53.218
You know, you'd think
somewhere in the zillions


1045
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:56.817
of questions that I was asking you,
you could have said,


1046
01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:58.972
"Casey, that stuff's not really the issue"

1047
01:38:59.050 --> 01:39:02.532
"because our future-predicting
machine says we're all gonna die."


1048
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:05.014
We did sort of hint at it.

1049
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:07.411
This place has nothing to do with hope.

1050
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:09.860
It's the opposite of hope.

1051
01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:12.092
- Come on. Don't say that.
- Why not?


1052
01:39:13.090 --> 01:39:14.216
You said it.

1053
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:16.455
No wonder you gave up.

1054
01:39:17.010 --> 01:39:18.739
That's before I knew about you.

1055
01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:22.333
I mean, you really...
You really are special.


1056
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:24.492
Why do you people
keep saying that to me?


1057
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.575
I'm not!

1058
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.934
Why'd you even give me this?

1059
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:38.740
You showed me a place
that was amazing and incredible


1060
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:40.619
and it was a lie.

1061
01:39:42.130 --> 01:39:44.053
If you're gonna zap an idea
into people's heads,


1062
01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:45.700
you should really make sure
that it's the truth.


1063
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:48.614
Because you can't do that.
You can't just zap...


1064
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:59.691
What?

1065
01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:02.414
Zap an idea into people's heads.

1066
01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:07.973
You were pirating the signal.

1067
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:09.540
- How?
- What?


1068
01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:11.891
At your house.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.


1069
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:14.018
You were boosting
the feed from that Monitor thing.


1070
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:15.580
- How did you do that?
- No big deal.


1071
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:19.416
They're running so much power through
it now, a ham radio could pick it up.


1072
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:21.697
It's just a matter of finding
the right frequency...


1073
01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:25.333
You grabbed a signal
from another dimension.


1074
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:29.616
From a machine here.
That means it's transmitting there.


1075
01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:32.375
What if it's not just
predicting the future?


1076
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:34.421
It's broadcasting it.

1077
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:36.420
When I touched this thing

1078
01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:39.016
for a few minutes,
it felt like anything was possible.


1079
01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:41.610
So then why can't the opposite happen?

1080
01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:44.261
What if The Monitor
is just a giant pin?

1081
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:46.094
But instead of making
you think positive,


1082
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:48.491
it makes you think negative and it...

1083
01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:54.491
And it's convincing
the whole world to feed the wrong wolf.


1084
01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:57.340
We need to turn that thing off.

1085
01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.376
It's time to go home.

1086
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.739
David. David.

1087
01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:16.457
- It's uninhabited and uncharted.
- Listen to me.


1088
01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:19.295
But it looks like a lovely place
to spend your last days.


1089
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:21.611
David... The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.


1090
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:23.613
It isn't just receiving tachyons.

1091
01:41:23.690 --> 01:41:25.738
It is taking a possible future and...

1092
01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:28.820
And amplifying it,
transmitting it, like a feedback loop.


1093
01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:31.973
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
that's coming from right there.


1094
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:34.018
But it's not just
showing people the end of the world,


1095
01:41:34.090 --> 01:41:36.741
it's giving them the idea over and over
again until they just accept it!


1096
01:41:36.810 --> 01:41:39.290
It's a ticking time bomb,
and we're the ones that lit the fuse.


1097
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:42.214
We still have 58 days
to try and change things.


1098
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:44.816
But nothing will work
as long as that thing is still on.


1099
01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:46.130
Young lady, I'm gonna assume

1100
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:48.861
that your knowledge
of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.


1101
01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:53.731
Shutting it down is impossible.
There is no off.


1102
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:56.971
I'm telling you what it's doing.

1103
01:41:57.090 --> 01:41:58.819
Why don't you care?

1104
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:01.220
Because he's the one that's doing it.

1105
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:09.090
Right?

1106
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:14.210
Let's imagine.

1107
01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:20.174
If you glimpsed the future
and were frightened by what you saw,


1108
01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:23.459
what would you do
with that information? You would go to...


1109
01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:26.741
Who? Politicians?
Captains of industry?


1110
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:30.093
And how would you convince them?
With data? Facts?


1111
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:32.096
Good luck.

1112
01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.979
The only facts they won't challenge

1113
01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:37.691
are the ones that keep the wheels
greased and the dollars rolling in.


1114
01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:39.420
But what if...

1115
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:42.460
What if there was a way
of skipping the middleman


1116
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:45.932
and putting the critical news
directly into everyone's head?


1117
01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:51.210
The probability of
widespread annihilation kept going up.


1118
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.453
The only way to stop
it was to show it.

1119
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.380
To scare people straight.

1120
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:59.977
Because what reasonable
human being wouldn't be galvanized


1121
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:01.211
by the potential destruction of

1122
01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:03.054
everything they have
ever known or loved?


1123
01:43:05.050 --> 01:43:09.658
To save civilization,
I would show its collapse.


1124
01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:13.736
But how do you think
this vision was received?


1125
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:18.176
How do you think people responded
to the prospect of imminent doom?


1126
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:21.453
They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate éclair.


1127
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:25.021
They didn't fear their demise,
they repackaged it.


1128
01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:30.100
It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.


1129
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:33.777
The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse


1130
01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:36.217
and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.


1131
01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:40.417
Meanwhile, your Earth
was crumbling all around you.


1132
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:44.176
You've got simultaneous
epidemics of obesity and starvation.


1133
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:45.297
Explain that one.

1134
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:49.540
Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

1135
01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:51.180
The glaciers melt.

1136
01:43:51.250 --> 01:43:54.299
Algae blooms all around you.

1137
01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.338
The coal mine canaries
are dropping dead,


1138
01:43:56.410 --> 01:43:59.141
and you won't take the hint!

1139
01:43:59.970 --> 01:44:03.816
In every moment, there is the
possibility of a better future.


1140
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:05.654
But you people won't believe it.

1141
01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:06.856
And because you won't believe it,

1142
01:44:06.970 --> 01:44:09.974
you won't do what is necessary
to make it a reality.


1143
01:44:10.050 --> 01:44:14.100
So you dwell on this terrible future,
and you resign yourselves to it.


1144
01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:15.170
For one reason,

1145
01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:19.454
because that future doesn't
ask anything of you today.


1146
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:26.134
So, yes, we saw the iceberg,
we warned the <i>Titanic.</i>


1147
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:31.018
But you all just steered for it anyway,
full steam ahead.


1148
01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:32.171
Why?

1149
01:44:33.570 --> 01:44:35.572
Because you want to sink.

1150
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:38.740
You gave up.

1151
01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:43.939
That's not The Monitor's fault.
That's yours.


1152
01:44:48.130 --> 01:44:49.256
Put them through.

1153
01:44:53.490 --> 01:44:55.254
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

1154
01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:58.891
It was genuinely nice to see you again.

1155
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:10.739
- What are you doing?
- Not giving up.


1156
01:45:27.930 --> 01:45:29.011
Look out!

1157
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:36.578
- Get the thing!
- What thing?


1158
01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:39.415
The thing I gave you
when we first got here!


1159
01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:43.492
Arm it! Get on the platform!

1160
01:45:50.530 --> 01:45:52.851
Casey! The bomb!

1161
01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:55.013
Get on the platform!

1162
01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:15.700
- Now what?
- Arm it!


1163
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:17.010
How?

1164
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:45.250
Casey!

1165
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:52.256
The bomb! Where is the bomb?

1166
01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:15.771
<i>One minute to detonation.</i>

1167
01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:21.216
<i>45 seconds.</i>

1168
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:24.339
Athena! The bomb.
What do I do? How do I turn it off?


1169
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:25.696
<i>30 seconds.</i>

1170
01:48:25.810 --> 01:48:27.141
You can't.

1171
01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:32.778
This is not funny!

1172
01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:38.736
Frank, get out of there! 
It's gonna blow!

1173
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:41.131
Frank, get out!

1174
01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:45.211
Get out of there!

1175
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:48.015
<i>- Four. Three.</i>
- Close the portal!


1176
01:48:48.090 --> 01:48:49.774
<i>- Two. One.</i>
- Close the portal!


1177
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:22.051
- Are you all right?
- The bomb's gone.


1178
01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:23.256
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.


1179
01:49:23.370 --> 01:49:24.531
Frank!

1180
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:29.771
No.

1181
01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:33.419
The bomb's gone.

1182
01:49:33.490 --> 01:49:35.219
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.


1183
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:36.377
Frank!

1184
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:53.336
- What happened? Is she okay?
- I need to get her to a repair module.


1185
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:56.493
Frank! No one's going to repair me.

1186
01:49:57.370 --> 01:49:58.701
Not in time.

1187
01:49:59.370 --> 01:50:01.532
I need to tell you something now.

1188
01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:10.136
Darn.

1189
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:12.860
I'm shutting down.

1190
01:50:12.930 --> 01:50:15.410
<i>I'm shutting down.</i>

1191
01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:19.180
I'm going to lose sync.

1192
01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:22.294
Don't look at me like that.

1193
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:27.695
- If I lose sync, it's not failure.
- I know.


1194
01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:32.455
There are things
I need to tell you before the final...


1195
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:36.376
Before the automated program kicks in.

1196
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:38.854
I'm a machine.

1197
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:41.731
I never thought that was bad

1198
01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:44.017
until I saw your face
when you found out I was.


1199
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:45.330
I always knew.

1200
01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:48.050
No, you didn't.

<i>I don't want to damage it.</i>

1211

1235
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:51.940
It's not programming.

1236
01:52:53.050 --> 01:52:54.415

Help get it right this time.

1243

Well, what do you know?

1245
01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:30.975

- Yeah?

<i>So, we're making it work.</i>

1262
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:06.614
<i>First order of business,</i>

1263
01:57:07.610 --> 01:57:09.055
<i>get the door back open.</i>

1264
01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:17.891
<i>Couldn't hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.</i>


1265
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.296
<i>Next...</i>

1266
01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:26.011
<i>Put the party back on.</i>

1267
01:57:28.210 --> 01:57:30.816
<i>And print out some new invitations.</i>

1268
01:57:33.010 --> 01:57:35.775
<i>Which brings us to
why we're here today.</i>


1269
01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:39.414
A year ago, it was
all supposed to be over.


1270
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:40.941
We shouldn't even be here.

1271
01:57:41.690 --> 01:57:43.021
But we are.

1272
01:57:44.410 --> 01:57:47.937
It isn't hard to knock down
a big, evil building


1273
01:57:48.010 --> 01:57:50.695
that's telling everybody
that the world's gonna end.


1274
01:57:51.850 --> 01:57:53.420
What is hard

1275
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:57.341
is figuring out what
to build in its place.

1276
01:57:58.370 --> 01:58:02.011
And if we're gonna do that,
we can't do it alone.


1277
01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:04.894
We're gonna need all of you.

1278
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:10.417
- Frank Walker, may I ask a question?
- Sure.


1279
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:14.376
The search parameters you've given us,
while mathematically sound,


1280
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:17.738
are a bit undefined.

1281
01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:20.659
Could you be more specific, please?

1282
01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:22.895
Well, Miss Newton,

1283
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:26.933
you wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?


1284
01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:28.421
Dreamers.

1285
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:32.212
We are looking for dreamers.

1286
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:36.173
Anyone who will feed the right wolf.

1287
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:50.611
So, I once told your predecessor

1288
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:55.096
that she was nothing
but a combination of ones and zeroes.


1289
01:58:58.890 --> 01:58:59.937
I was wrong.

1290
01:59:00.650 --> 01:59:02.254
She was much more than that.

1291
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:05.251
You are much more than that, too.

1292
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:08.939
So, go out there
and do what she would have done.


1293
01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:12.258
Find the ones who haven't given up.

1294
01:59:13.290 --> 01:59:14.496
They're the future.

1295
01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:24.520
