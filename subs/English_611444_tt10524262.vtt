1
00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:30.799
DAVID: My name is Dave Paulides

2
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.559
and I'm a former
police detective


3
00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:33.974
and current
investigative author


4
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.943
focused primarily
on mysterious disappearances


5
00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:38.772
in the North American
wilderness.


6
00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:45.124
MAN: [SHOUTING] Melvin!

7
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:48.541
DAVID: My journey into the disappearances began
when I was visiting a national park

8
00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:52.372
and was approached
by two park rangers
who knew I was an author.


9
00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:57.412
They described strange
circumstances over the years
involving missing hikers.


10
00:00:57.446 --> 00:01:00.415
I immediately began looking
into the phenomenon.


11
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.072
Eight years
and eight books later,


12
00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:05.247
I've now researched 1200
cases that fit the profile

13
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:08.078
we are about to examine.

14
00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:11.598
While these cases involve
people of all ages and
all walks of life,


15
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.291
I've chosen to present some
of the most intriguing cases


16
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:15.982
involving hunters.

17
00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:19.399
Generally speaking,
hunters are very experienced,


18
00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:22.471
aware, and knowledgeable
outdoorsmen.


19
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.785
And so, when one vanishes,

20
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.959
you know something unusual
has occurred.


21
00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.424
One of the most perplexing
cases I've examined


22
00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.186
involves a hunter named
Thomas Messick,


23
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.500
who in 2015, went missing
in North-East New York.


24
00:01:58.576 --> 00:01:59.819
DAVID: For people
who don't know,


25
00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.305
the FBI doesn't investigate
missing adults.


26
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.689
There's a sub-category
for the FBI, that they can
become involved


27
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:10.174
in the disappearance
of extremely young children


28
00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.900
under a certain set of criteria.

29
00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:17.147
So, the million dollar
question is, why would
the FBI arrive


30
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.734
on Tom Messick's case?

31
00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:41.654
WIFE: He loved the outdoors.
He loved being in the woods.


32
00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:43.966
Hunting and fishing
was his life.


33
00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:52.906
You want a cookie, honey?

34
00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:00.949
BEVERLY: He was
a very good husband,
very good father.


35
00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:05.574
And I don't think
you will find anybody


36
00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.715
who ever met him
who didn't like him.


37
00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.546
DAVID: And how many kids
did you guys have?


38
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.410
BEVERLY: We had three sons.

39
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:15.757
Tommy, Jean, and Rob.

40
00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:20.244
So, tell me about your dad.
What kind of guy was he?


41
00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:25.145
He was kinda, "Do what you got
to go to get things done."


42
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.218
Never had a contractor
in the house.
We always did everything.


43
00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:29.564
You name it.

44
00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:31.980
We lifted the house up,
put a foundation under it.


45
00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:33.706
When I was digging it out,
I looked up at him,


46
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.155
he had a cup of coffee
in his hand


47
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.605
and I said,
"Why don't we get a backhoe?"


48
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.262
And he said,
"I have one, right there."


49
00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:40.057
[BOTH LAUGH]

50
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.439
What did you guys like to do
as a family?


51
00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:45.890
We camped.
We did a lot of camping.


52
00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.893
And the boys loved it
and, you know,


53
00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:52.242
I was kind of the outsider
because they were boys


54
00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:56.176
and they hunted and fished
and did those things.


55
00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:01.734
SID: I knew Tom
before we earned enough


56
00:04:01.768 --> 00:04:03.839
'cause he used
to work in Norton with me.


57
00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:08.982
I knew him probably
about 55 years
or somewhere around there.


58
00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:10.777
DAVID: What did you guys like
to do together?


59
00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:13.677
Hunt. Hunt and fish.

60
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.644
It's what we did
all the time, really.


61
00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.958
[SID'S WIFE SPEAKING]

62
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.961
Yeah, we both had trailers

63
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:26.137
in which we used
to go trailing all the time,
come to think of it.


64
00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:28.278
We all got
the same vacation in Norton,


65
00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:33.938
so we all took off and went
to different places like that.


66
00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.287
So, what was your introduction
to the outdoors?


67
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:41.877
It was always there
because my father
always hunted and fished.


68
00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:46.606
ROB: We got a camp up North,
not far from Brant Lake,


69
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:48.815
for about a week every year.

70
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.817
A bunch of guys get together
and go hunting.


71
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.899
BEVERLY: He taught
hunter training
for a long time.


72
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:08.318
He probably taught every one
of the kids around here.


73
00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:12.011
SID: Tom was a great guy. 
He was an old airborne Ranger.

74
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.841
He was unbelievable
in the woods.


75
00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:17.672
He taught my hunting class for
me to get my hunting license.


76
00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:19.259
He taught survival.

77
00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:21.814
BEVERLY: He had gunpowder
blow up in his face,


78
00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:23.022
and that's how he lost...

79
00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:26.750
He had a 159 stitches
in his hand


80
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.855
and he lost his eye that way.

81
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.719
So, he would say to these kids,

82
00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:33.239
"This is what happens
if you're not careful."


83
00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:35.206
I mean, he had a lot of issues
over the years,


84
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:39.038
but it never really seemed
to slow him down or anything.


85
00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:42.041
So, obviously, he had one eye.

86
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.180
Yeah.

87
00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:45.078
He was sort of blind,
it wasn't really that great,


88
00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:46.942
but he could actually see
out of it.


89
00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:48.530
And hearing was an issue?

90
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:49.773
He wasn't
that great with hearing.


91
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.947
Hearing,
he needed hearing aids.


92
00:05:51.982 --> 00:05:55.192
Would Tom be the kind of guy
who would drink a lot or...


93
00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:58.678
No. He didn't drink
that much, no.


94
00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:01.992
So, the day when you guys went
hunting, did you guys drink
when you hunt?


95
00:06:02.544 --> 00:06:04.304
No.

96
00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.411
We might have beer
with us in the truck.


97
00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:11.760
Out in the woods, we might have
a beer or something like that.


98
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.314
Nothing excessive, you know?

99
00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.317
How would you describe
your dad's judgment?


100
00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.941
It was good.

101
00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:23.807
ROB: In fact, it was
probably one of his better days

102
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.946
I had seen in a long time.

103
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.467
He was in good spirits
and moving great.


104
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:32.263
Didn't seem to even have
an ache or pain
in him that day.


105
00:06:32.298 --> 00:06:33.368
He was moving good.

106
00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:43.827
DAVID: How often
do you think about it?


107
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.933
I just think about it, well...

108
00:06:46.968 --> 00:06:50.109
SID: You know, it
always pops into your mind.

109
00:06:54.493 --> 00:06:56.426
We were doing
just kind of a quick thing.


110
00:06:57.496 --> 00:06:59.118
It was late actually.

111
00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:03.087
Almost lunchtime by the time
we ended up going up there.


112
00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.607
Kind of just a two-hour thing
until evening


113
00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:09.128
and we were going to go back
to camp and hunt around
the camp until dark.


114
00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:16.584
DAVID: How many guys
went up there that day?


115
00:07:16.618 --> 00:07:18.586
Seven.

116
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.623
Someone made the decision
to hunt over by Brant Lake.


117
00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:22.590
Who made that decision?

118
00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:24.454
I did.

119
00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:27.215
SID: I messaged
that we had state
land there.


120
00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:30.494
We kind of agreed to hunt it.
The roads of Lily Pond.


121
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:45.060
I mean, we go up that road,
straight to the lake


122
00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:47.718
and we parked
right at the lake.


123
00:07:47.753 --> 00:07:51.722
And the old guys
literally walked down that road

124
00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:53.241
in hundred yard increments.

125
00:07:58.073 --> 00:08:02.837
We walked in 30, 40 yards
at the most and sat down.


126
00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:12.847
Al was the first watcher.

127
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:14.262
I was the second.

128
00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:17.265
Joe Capacelli, and then Tom.

129
00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.888
So, Tom was furthest
from the lake?


130
00:08:19.923 --> 00:08:21.890
He was the furthest one.

131
00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:24.065
We followed the trail along
the lake,


132
00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:26.170
come up that snowmobile trail,

133
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.345
hopped into the woods,
and swung up to him.


134
00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:31.037
A slow
hunt-and-drive type thing.


135
00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:35.455
BEVERLY: The young boys said
to the old men,


136
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.250
"You four sit here,

137
00:08:37.285 --> 00:08:40.875
and if we see any deer,
we'll push them towards you."


138
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.603
And if Tom was a watcher,
Tom would not have moved.


139
00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:46.708
I know that for a fact.

140
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:48.917
He was a watcher,
that's where he was.


141
00:09:03.138 --> 00:09:05.727
-DAVID: Did you see any deer?
-SID: None at all.


142
00:09:05.762 --> 00:09:08.592
-No.
-Did you hear anything?


143
00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:13.114
I heard a strange noise
in the woods, but I don't know
what it was.


144
00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.945
Just a different noise from what
I usually hear, you know?


145
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.188
DAVID: Like what?

146
00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:22.054
It'd be hard
to explain because...


147
00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:23.400
But it was different.

148
00:09:23.434 --> 00:09:26.437
Something different that I never
heard before in the woods.


149
00:09:28.163 --> 00:09:30.476
I just can't say what it was,
you know?


150
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.617
How long in duration was it?
Was it two or three seconds?


151
00:09:33.652 --> 00:09:35.585
No, it's just...

152
00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:36.931
Whatever it is, you know?

153
00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.244
DAVID: How far away was it?

154
00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:44.317
SID: I'd say it was
probably 150 yards, something like that.

155
00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:46.354
DAVID: Was it toward Tom,
or away from Tom?


156
00:09:46.388 --> 00:09:49.909
SID: This was up
towards the hill.
The top of the hill. Yeah.


157
00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:51.531
DAVID: Did you tell
the cops this?


158
00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:52.463
Yeah, I told them that.

159
00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.225
But they just passed it off,
you know?


160
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.749
DAVID: The report said that
your dad was carrying
a walkie-talkie?


161
00:10:01.783 --> 00:10:03.613
-ROB: Yeah.
-DAVID: Who else had one?


162
00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:04.683
We all did.

163
00:10:04.717 --> 00:10:06.823
-All on the same channel?
-Yup.


164
00:10:06.857 --> 00:10:08.514
-Anybody ever hear anything?
-No.


165
00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.655
DAVID: Did your dad know
how to use it?


166
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.622
ROB: Yep.

167
00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.946
MAN: Tom? Tom, you around?

168
00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:30.674
ROB: It's one of those things
where, you know, he
should have been out by now.


169
00:10:30.709 --> 00:10:32.055
SID: We called and called.

170
00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.851
You know, he should have been
sitting on the watch.


171
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:36.473
MAN: Can you hear me?
Holler back.


172
00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.509
ROB: And then we went
and started looking for him.


173
00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.689
DAVID: Anybody fire any shots?

174
00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:48.002
ROB: Yep, we fired shots.

175
00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.177
[GUNSHOT]

176
00:10:52.765 --> 00:10:55.181
[GUNSHOT]

177
00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:57.805
ROB: Somebody went down
and called the rangers,


178
00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:59.358
and then, we just kept looking.

179
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:04.190
MAN: [SHOUTING] Tom!

180
00:11:15.857 --> 00:11:19.516
SID: They stayed overnight at
the truck, beeping the horn.

181
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.243
I heard shots,
different things.


182
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:29.284
BEVERLY: Robbie called me
that night and said,


183
00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:31.735
"Daddy's missing in the woods, but don't worry,

184
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.771
we'll find him."

185
00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:36.291
[HORN BEEPING]

186
00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:38.224
[GUNSHOT]

187
00:11:39.432 --> 00:11:41.124
And I said, "I'm coming up."

188
00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:46.888
BEVERLY: And he said,
"No, don't come up. I'm sure
we're going to find him


189
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:48.510
and I'll call you."

190
00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:58.313
MATTHEW: The community is
very close-knit,


191
00:11:58.348 --> 00:12:00.281
everybody has
pretty much grown up together


192
00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:02.076
and knows everybody.

193
00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:09.669
It's mountainous,
we have lakes,


194
00:12:09.704 --> 00:12:12.500
we've got lots of opportunities to enjoy yourself.

195
00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:14.088
There's not
a lot of pressure here.


196
00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:17.125
MATTHEW: I came into work
one morning


197
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.508
and I noticed
a State Police helicopter


198
00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:23.891
had landed in our ball field,
right here behind the town hall.

199
00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:26.756
And then, I could see
some rangers


200
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.585
ranging in our parking lot.

201
00:12:28.619 --> 00:12:31.899
Their vehicles and different apparatus and...

202
00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:33.486
I questioned what was going on

203
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.110
and they said
there was a hunter
that had been missing.


204
00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:51.919
SHAUN: We did note that
when we were up there,


205
00:12:51.953 --> 00:12:53.817
it seemed to be
devoid of wildlife.


206
00:12:53.852 --> 00:12:57.476
You know, we didn't see
squirrels, chipmunks, deer...


207
00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:00.099
or any signs of them.

208
00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:02.308
How unusual is that
for your mountains out here?


209
00:13:03.827 --> 00:13:05.691
I thought it was strange.

210
00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:08.798
Like I said, we didn't see signs
of anything out there.


211
00:13:08.832 --> 00:13:10.800
DAVID: How many people
did Warren
County commit?


212
00:13:10.834 --> 00:13:13.216
We had our Emergency Response
Team up there,


213
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.701
which is comprised
of 13 team members.


214
00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:18.290
DAVID: So, when you heard
about it, what did you do?


215
00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:20.844
Go up there and join the search.

216
00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.397
I figured it would be...

217
00:13:22.432 --> 00:13:25.435
We'd go up there
and we'd find him
and it'd be over, you know?


218
00:13:26.781 --> 00:13:30.198
SID: The Air National Guard
was going over with infrared.

219
00:13:30.233 --> 00:13:33.512
State Police had helicopters
with a guy out.


220
00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.652
We walked through the woods,
no matter how thick they were.

221
00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.896
You had to see the other
guy's ankle.


222
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.830
We went through some terrain
you just wouldn't believe,


223
00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:42.486
swamps up to your chest,

224
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.902
and we covered every bit of it.

225
00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:51.564
BEVERLY: They were thinking,
maybe he got to a road
and got hit by a car.


226
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.705
And so, they checked on
the sides of the roads


227
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.673
and never found anything.

228
00:13:56.707 --> 00:14:00.435
The first couple of days, I
thought for sure we're going to
find him.


229
00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:05.199
After about the third or fourth,
I said, "Boy, this ain't good."


230
00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:10.790
A mile out, we were
still me to you away.


231
00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:13.172
Walking through the woods,
you'd trip over somebody,


232
00:14:13.207 --> 00:14:15.450
nevermind not see him.

233
00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:17.521
We would have what they call
"bump lines."


234
00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:20.870
Lines that they would
run through the forest


235
00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:23.596
and we knew that was like a
start and a stop.


236
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:25.598
ROB: Guy in the end had
a roll of string


237
00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:27.946
and would tie it to a tree
and just keep walking.


238
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.775
And when we're done with that
grid, they'd tie it off


239
00:14:29.809 --> 00:14:31.777
and then everybody would
shift to the other side

240
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:34.228
and walk back.

241
00:14:34.262 --> 00:14:36.886
And so you know
between this string line
and this string line


242
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.370
and between your bump lines,

243
00:14:38.404 --> 00:14:40.475
that area has been covered.

244
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.892
And few days later, we were back
to the same barriers


245
00:14:42.926 --> 00:14:44.548
and did them the other way.

246
00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:48.449
SID: I mean, we covered
every inch of ground up there.

247
00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:51.624
The immediate area
looked like a spider web,


248
00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:55.387
because not only did they
go this way or this way,


249
00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:56.906
and they went that way.

250
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.390
So, there was string everywhere.

251
00:14:58.424 --> 00:15:01.358
They had 300 people
in there one day.


252
00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:03.636
ROB: People asked who he was.

253
00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:05.776
If he was a governor's brother, or something.

254
00:15:06.432 --> 00:15:07.675
It was incredible.

255
00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:12.922
DAVID: How many jurisdictions
do you think responded
to this search?


256
00:15:12.956 --> 00:15:17.064
DOUG: There was probably
a dozen or so volunteer
fire departments


257
00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:18.479
that had members here.

258
00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:23.242
Probably 50 or 60 altogether
in different organizations.


259
00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:25.520
-DAVID: That's huge.
-DOUG: Yeah.


260
00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:29.317
New York State Corrections
came out and they
searched with their dogs.


261
00:15:29.352 --> 00:15:32.596
There were tonnes of volunteer
search and rescue teams


262
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.598
that came out
with their K-9 units.


263
00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:37.877
I mean, they...
For a little while,
but not for very long.


264
00:15:37.912 --> 00:15:40.950
Day two that we were involved
in the search up there,


265
00:15:40.984 --> 00:15:43.193
it rained heavily all day.

266
00:15:43.228 --> 00:15:46.956
Obviously, an animal
didn't get to him, because
there'd be a big scatter.


267
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.441
There'd be a huge, you know...
His clothes would be ripped up,


268
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:51.477
his stuff would spread be all
over. He'd be easy to find.


269
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.001
BEVERLY: Not even
a candy wrapper.


270
00:15:58.036 --> 00:16:00.970
Not that my husband would throw
out a candy wrapper,


271
00:16:01.004 --> 00:16:02.143
'cause he wouldn't.

272
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.593
That would be in his pocket.

273
00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:05.526
But, nothing.

274
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.115
Not the walkie-talkie,
not his gun.


275
00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:10.324
They never found anything.

276
00:16:10.358 --> 00:16:12.188
You would think that
you'd find some trace


277
00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.983
of somebody who was there,

278
00:16:14.017 --> 00:16:14.984
especially a weapon,

279
00:16:15.018 --> 00:16:17.400
because a weapon
is not going to disappear.


280
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:18.677
It's not going to blow away.

281
00:16:24.062 --> 00:16:28.514
SHAUN: The FBI, according
to their protocol, doesn't
search for missing people.


282
00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:30.896
So, do you understand
why they were there?


283
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.449
I remember they were there.

284
00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:35.728
I thought they were there to
provide some sort of
technological support,


285
00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:39.353
but I didn't have
any contact with them myself.


286
00:16:39.387 --> 00:16:41.355
Have you ever had them
on a search that you've done?


287
00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:42.839
No.

288
00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:46.049
You had a conversation
with the FBI, up in Horicon.


289
00:16:46.636 --> 00:16:47.913
What did they tell you?

290
00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:50.260
They said that...

291
00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:52.711
Basically, they were there
to tell me that


292
00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:56.853
he now is considered
a missing person.


293
00:16:56.887 --> 00:17:02.238
And they felt that something
was definitely not right,


294
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.861
but unless and until

295
00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:08.037
they made a recovery,
they wouldn't know what it was.


296
00:17:08.071 --> 00:17:11.454
BEVERLY: That was it.
That's basically
what they said.


297
00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.528
DAVID: In the middle
of the Adirondacks


298
00:17:16.562 --> 00:17:19.082
where an elderly man disappears,

299
00:17:20.014 --> 00:17:22.568
two agents suddenly show up.

300
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:26.469
They made their way up
to Lily Pond Road


301
00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:30.542
and they started to monitor
this incident.


302
00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:33.372
Every time an FBI agent
arrives at a scene


303
00:17:33.407 --> 00:17:35.374
and is stating that they're
monitoring it,


304
00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:38.481
they're taking notes
and they're writing reports


305
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:43.624
and those reports go to the
behavioral analysts in Virginia.


306
00:17:43.658 --> 00:17:47.076
And what their job is,
is to look for other cases


307
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.975
that match the profile
that they're writing about.


308
00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:57.120
I think they get it.
I think they understand.


309
00:17:57.155 --> 00:18:00.434
And maybe they're trying
to put the pieces together,
just as we are.


310
00:18:13.032 --> 00:18:15.173
ROB: We'd kinda like to know
what happened,


311
00:18:15.207 --> 00:18:16.519
but I don't think we ever will.

312
00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:18.728
Even if they found him,
we wouldn't know what happened.

313
00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:22.490
Something odd happened,
obviously.


314
00:18:22.525 --> 00:18:23.802
We just don't know what.

315
00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:32.500
BEVERLY: I was there
until 11 days.


316
00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:34.985
And then, I finally
said to my older son,


317
00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:38.506
"I can't sit here anymore.
I got to go home."


318
00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:42.131
We came back, I think,
for Thanksgiving.


319
00:18:42.165 --> 00:18:44.478
That's when we stopped.

320
00:18:44.512 --> 00:18:48.965
We were down to just me
and some rangers


321
00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.209
and couple of other guys,
that was it,
by the time it was over.


322
00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:55.799
BEVERLY: He is
such a sweet dog.


323
00:18:55.834 --> 00:19:01.978
He sits at my kitchen window
all day long.


324
00:19:02.012 --> 00:19:04.636
He sits here and he waits
for Tom to come back.


325
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.536
If you go by my house, you'll
see the dog in the window.


326
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:11.815
Did you dad tell you
about a sound he heard
in the woods that day?


327
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.371
He said he heard some kind of
snapping or crack sound


328
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.855
that was strange.

329
00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.684
It wasn't something
he normally hears in the woods.


330
00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:20.824
He still talks to me about it.

331
00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:25.104
He almost said it sounded like
a big trap closing or something.


332
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.108
I don't know, you know?

333
00:19:29.143 --> 00:19:33.216
Anything that you think
that the audience should know
about your dad


334
00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:34.528
or about this incident?

335
00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.014
I tell you, you really
do never know.


336
00:19:38.048 --> 00:19:40.879
I mean, they always say
you should go in prepared.


337
00:19:41.707 --> 00:19:45.090
I mean, we treated that hunt

338
00:19:45.124 --> 00:19:47.196
like I was walking out here
in the backyard.


339
00:19:48.749 --> 00:19:50.268
It was really nothing.

340
00:19:50.302 --> 00:19:53.271
You just don't expect it.

341
00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:01.451
DAVID: An interesting side note
to the disappearance of Tom Messick

342
00:20:01.486 --> 00:20:03.626
is the case of Fred Drumm.

343
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:11.047
About the tenth day
of Tom Messick's search,


344
00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:14.361
the Department of Conservation
Rangers for the State
of New York


345
00:20:14.395 --> 00:20:16.880
were pulled off of that event

346
00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:21.954
and sent 40 miles South
to Schuylerville, New York.


347
00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:25.544
Fred lived on his rural farm
with his wife.


348
00:20:25.579 --> 00:20:28.547
Fred was a retired supervisor
from his town.


349
00:20:28.582 --> 00:20:30.239
Was an outdoorsman.

350
00:20:30.273 --> 00:20:33.966
On Thanksgiving Day of 2015,

351
00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:36.486
Mrs. Drumm went
to attend a banquet,


352
00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:40.835
and when she returned
in the afternoon,
her husband wasn't there.


353
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.943
His car was there,
all of his belongings
were in the house,


354
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.601
but he had simply vanished.

355
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:50.880
There were helicopters, K-9s,

356
00:20:51.432 --> 00:20:54.124
there was a huge SAR.

357
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:59.129
And the eventual outcome
was the same as Tom's.


358
00:20:59.164 --> 00:21:03.479
It's quite a coincidence
that two elderly men,
both hunters,


359
00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.308
disappeared from a rural area,

360
00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:07.621
weren't found,

361
00:21:07.655 --> 00:21:10.244
and both have been
just chalked up
to disappearing.


362
00:21:34.337 --> 00:21:37.789
The thing that connects
all of theMissing 411 cases


363
00:21:37.823 --> 00:21:39.273
are the profile points.

364
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.004
And these have been gleaned
after reading thousands
of cases


365
00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:49.248
and seeing them come up
time after time,


366
00:21:49.283 --> 00:21:53.356
and realizing
that they are part
of the underlying story


367
00:21:53.391 --> 00:21:54.875
of each of these incidents.

368
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.983
If the victim is with others,

369
00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:03.262
and decides to move away from
them and be on their own,

370
00:22:03.297 --> 00:22:08.060
that's the point in time
something happens
and the victim disappears.


371
00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:10.200
We call this
the point of separation.


372
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.757
The most common time
for a victim to disappear


373
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:16.862
is in the mid to late
afternoon hours.


374
00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:20.728
Granite boulders
and rock fields.


375
00:22:20.763 --> 00:22:26.285
Victims are often found to
disappear in the areas of
granite or rock fields.


376
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.874
Victims found
or disappearing near water...


377
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.118
This is a very common trait

378
00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:33.741
and one that happens
anywhere in the world


379
00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:36.261
and isn't isolated
to a geographical area.


380
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:40.852
There appears to be
a weather incident


381
00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:44.373
in close proximity to the
time that the person disappears

382
00:22:44.407 --> 00:22:46.375
or when the search starts.

383
00:22:46.409 --> 00:22:48.894
The weather issue could be
anywhere from a dust storm,


384
00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:50.724
to a full-blown blizzard.

385
00:22:51.587 --> 00:22:53.796
Disability or illness.

386
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.902
Often times, the victim is
later found to have


387
00:22:56.937 --> 00:22:58.594
either an obvious,

388
00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:01.424
or a very subliminal disability or illness.

389
00:23:03.253 --> 00:23:06.705
Canines can't find the scent,
or lose the scent quickly.


390
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.088
This is an extremely common
profile point


391
00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:12.815
that's probably in 95
percent of all the cases

392
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:14.195
that have been documented.

393
00:23:15.818 --> 00:23:18.441
This is an indictment
of Search and Rescue.


394
00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:21.720
But for some unknown reason,
the victims are found
in an area


395
00:23:21.755 --> 00:23:24.274
that had been searched
maybe dozens of times.


396
00:23:25.517 --> 00:23:27.243
Clothes, shoes removed.

397
00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:31.420
A common trait is that the
victims are missing
clothing or shoes


398
00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:32.766
at the time they're found.

399
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:35.009
Unknown cause of death.

400
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.460
If the victim is found,

401
00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:41.084
and when they go through
a medical examination,


402
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.328
the coroners can't determine
a cause of death.


403
00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:47.021
And finally, clusters.

404
00:23:47.056 --> 00:23:49.161
There's a geographical
clustering effect


405
00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:52.199
to the victims that fit
theMissing 411 profile.


406
00:23:52.233 --> 00:23:55.927
There can be anywhere
from three
to 70 or 80 people


407
00:23:55.961 --> 00:23:57.998
in each geographical cluster.

408
00:24:16.982 --> 00:24:19.882
This is an area that
I've always wanted to come to


409
00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:21.470
for a variety of reasons.

410
00:24:23.057 --> 00:24:25.784
First of all,
it's just drop dead gorgeous.


411
00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:29.063
But also,
it's a regional cluster


412
00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:32.481
of unexplained missing people
going back decades.


413
00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:55.607
This is one of those clusters

414
00:24:56.574 --> 00:24:58.334
of the 59 I've documented

415
00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:01.095
that really has intrigued me
over the years.


416
00:25:04.685 --> 00:25:06.929
And within this
Santa Fe cluster,


417
00:25:06.963 --> 00:25:09.552
we're going to focus on
three very unusual,


418
00:25:09.587 --> 00:25:12.659
very mysterious disappearances.

419
00:25:12.693 --> 00:25:17.629
The first being 75-year-old
Audrey Kaplan who
disappeared in July 2014.


420
00:25:20.114 --> 00:25:22.013
She was with her husband,

421
00:25:22.047 --> 00:25:25.464
they had a house here
in Santa Fe.


422
00:25:25.499 --> 00:25:30.193
And they decided to come up
to the ski-resort
and look for mushrooms.


423
00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:33.231
It was a popular mushroom
picking site up in here.


424
00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:37.028
And what they did,

425
00:25:37.062 --> 00:25:40.618
is they hiked up the trail
into the wilderness area


426
00:25:40.652 --> 00:25:43.966
and somewhere or another,
they got separated.


427
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.627
Audrey, who was
in extremely good shape
for an older person,


428
00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:53.596
couldn't be found,
and they started
to search for her.


429
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:56.392
Audrey disappeared July 30th,

430
00:25:56.426 --> 00:25:59.740
one of the hottest months
in the Santa Fe area.


431
00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:04.400
Now, there were
thunderstorms that
happened post disappearance.


432
00:26:04.434 --> 00:26:06.471
And that night,
they had searchers on scene


433
00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.231
and for the following
several days,


434
00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:10.130
they scoured that mountain.

435
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:14.237
And eventually, days later,

436
00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:19.622
one searcher, way off the primary grid area,

437
00:26:19.657 --> 00:26:22.936
came upon a very unusual sight.

438
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:28.631
He started to see a camping
area that seemed to be
pretty much destroyed.


439
00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:34.637
And he walked up
and he saw a woman
in the fetal position,


440
00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:38.089
in about four or five inches
of water in a creek,


441
00:26:38.123 --> 00:26:40.298
deceased, naked.

442
00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:42.990
No shoes, no clothing,
no nothing.


443
00:26:43.784 --> 00:26:45.648
Her face was in the creek.

444
00:26:45.683 --> 00:26:49.410
Her entire body
was lying on its side
in the fetal position.


445
00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.654
A very strange sight.

446
00:27:01.422 --> 00:27:03.632
And the coroner
made a determination


447
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.738
that was even more unusual
than the sight in the creek.


448
00:27:16.506 --> 00:27:19.682
And he said that
there was no physical evidence

449
00:27:19.717 --> 00:27:22.720
that she died of hypothermia.

450
00:27:22.754 --> 00:27:26.862
But the determination was
hypothermia that killed her.


451
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:30.486
Now, I've read
that report 20 times.


452
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.177
It makes no sense.

453
00:27:32.212 --> 00:27:35.318
She had no distinct injuries
to her body,


454
00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:39.046
that there was no physical
symptoms of hypothermia.


455
00:27:41.842 --> 00:27:47.883
He also stated that in his
report, her face wasn't
in the water.


456
00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:50.851
And the crime scene photos
clearly show


457
00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:53.371
Audrey was completely
in that creek.


458
00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:59.273
So, a lot of confusing,
strange aspects


459
00:27:59.308 --> 00:28:01.379
to the Audrey Kaplan
disappearance.


460
00:28:06.971 --> 00:28:11.527
The second story that involves this exact area

461
00:28:11.561 --> 00:28:14.599
and that's

462
00:28:14.633 --> 00:28:17.740
who disappeared
up in the wilderness.


463
00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:21.054
Went up to Elk Mountain
in the Santa Fe
National Forest.


464
00:28:21.088 --> 00:28:22.331
Elk hunting.

465
00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:04.131
What kind of wildlife
would somebody find


466
00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.650
up in the mountains out here?

467
00:29:05.684 --> 00:29:11.104
We're rich.
Elk, mule deer,
bear, lions.


468
00:29:11.138 --> 00:29:13.002
DAVID: And the size of
the elk and the deer?

469
00:29:13.037 --> 00:29:14.417
BOB: Really good,
trophy quality.


470
00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:15.798
Mexico's got
really good animals.


471
00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:18.318
We're stingy on our tags,
it's a draw system.


472
00:29:21.355 --> 00:29:24.082
So, hunting is
a really big sport.


473
00:29:24.117 --> 00:29:26.153
New Mexico is a destination
for elk hunters.


474
00:29:26.188 --> 00:29:29.260
The numbers out there are
very small compared to
our western states,


475
00:29:29.294 --> 00:29:31.227
but our hunting quality
is really high.


476
00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:36.715
DAVID: Mel had
a slight knee injury.


477
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.132
He had stepped in a
gopher hole while target practicing

478
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.478
a day or two prior.

479
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:44.793
Once Mel met up
with his friends
at Elk Mountain,


480
00:29:44.827 --> 00:29:48.106
and the three made a plan
for the evening's hunt,


481
00:29:48.141 --> 00:29:51.420
Mel would stick close while
the other two would go on
a pretty good hike.


482
00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:53.456
Mel pointed at a group of trees

483
00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:55.804
about a 100 or 150 yards
down the trail,


484
00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:58.151
while the other two would
hike in the opposite direction

485
00:29:58.185 --> 00:29:59.324
toward the peak.

486
00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:18.792
Did you expect him
to come home that night?


487
00:30:21.174 --> 00:30:23.141
No. The following morning
he said he's coming back.


488
00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:24.522
So, he was going
to camp up there?


489
00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:25.350
Yes.

490
00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:26.420
-Spend the night.
-Yeah.


491
00:30:26.455 --> 00:30:27.663
DAVID: And he's done
that before?


492
00:30:27.697 --> 00:30:28.837
Yes.

493
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:33.082
DAVID: Did Mel ever jog
or walk long distances?


494
00:30:33.117 --> 00:30:34.704
EDNA: No.

495
00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:38.087
DAVID: So, if Mel saw an elk,
he's not going to walk
three miles?


496
00:30:38.122 --> 00:30:39.019
No.

497
00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:40.365
He won't do it?

498
00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:44.576
He doesn't like to walk.

499
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.511
So, knowing that,

500
00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:51.204
then that really
puts confinement...


501
00:30:51.238 --> 00:30:53.862
-Yeah.
-...on where he would have been.


502
00:30:53.896 --> 00:30:54.897
Yeah.

503
00:31:01.214 --> 00:31:03.872
EDNA: He didn't go
hiking with them.


504
00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:08.911
The friends went
up the mountain, like,
searching for animals.


505
00:31:08.946 --> 00:31:10.948
And then, when they get down,

506
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:12.881
the jeep was there,

507
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:15.400
there was no Mel.

508
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.541
DAVID: But he should
have been back by then.


509
00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:20.785
He should have been there.

514
00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:00.929
DAVID: Eventually,
another hunter came along
with a satellite phone.


515
00:32:00.963 --> 00:32:05.588
They called Search and Rescue,
they responded with K-9s,
ground teams.


516
00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:07.521
And the K-9s tracked
right to the spot


517
00:32:07.556 --> 00:32:09.938
where everyone expected
Mel to be, at his blind.


518
00:32:11.111 --> 00:32:13.527
Now, think about this
for a minute.


519
00:32:13.562 --> 00:32:17.600
If Mel had wandered,
maybe shot an elk,


520
00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:19.775
and traveled to look for it,

521
00:32:19.809 --> 00:32:22.674
his tracks and his scent
would be past that point,


522
00:32:22.709 --> 00:32:23.710
but they weren't.

523
00:32:24.538 --> 00:32:26.955
And Mel was carrying a bow.

524
00:32:27.576 --> 00:32:28.887
He was carrying a firearm.

525
00:32:30.027 --> 00:32:31.752
Where are those items?

526
00:32:33.927 --> 00:32:36.343
When he went out hunting,
he had a pistol.

How can you carry it
if you get lost?


533
00:32:50.047 --> 00:32:53.705
Isn't it going to get heavy
to hold onto all of it?

There's nothing.

Shoes... One of the arrows
would have fallen,

or the bow has to drop
because those are heavy.

Nothing.

say that was odd?

There's nothing.
A shred of clothing, nothing.

If he was attacked by a bear,
there's no shred
of clothing anywhere.

you know the story.

00:33:46.034 --> 00:33:47.759
What could have happened to him
in your mind?

00:33:47.794 --> 00:33:50.417
Here in New Mexico, Roswell,
alien abduction.

Yeah.

552
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:58.080
Really, he had
to have gotten a ride out.


553
00:33:58.115 --> 00:34:02.395
He had to have been picked up
or gotten a ride out, I assume.


554
00:34:02.429 --> 00:34:05.639
If he was a mobile person
and a hiking person,


555
00:34:05.674 --> 00:34:08.056
he could just be
so far off target


556
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.403
from where anybody assumed
he was going.


557
00:34:10.437 --> 00:34:12.198
But in his sense,
what we understand,


558
00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:13.820
he probably didn't do that.

559
00:34:13.854 --> 00:34:15.028
DAVID: Right.

560
00:34:15.063 --> 00:34:18.376
He probably didn't take off
on a long march anywhere.

History mystery.

What happens to a big jet
airline in the huge ocean?


563
00:34:27.454 --> 00:34:30.492
DAVID: As strange
as Mel Nadel's case was,


564
00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:33.081
there was another case

565
00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:35.600
much more recently.

566
00:34:36.153 --> 00:34:39.432
On November 7th, 2017,

567
00:34:40.157 --> 00:34:41.641
another hunter disappeared.

568
00:34:45.196 --> 00:34:46.646
Stanley came up to an area

569
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.821
about 10 miles from
where Mel Nadel disappeared.


570
00:34:49.856 --> 00:34:52.479
In an area called
Barillas Peak.


571
00:34:52.514 --> 00:34:57.277
And he was in his vehicle
with his father
and another friend


572
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:59.969
and they were driving
the dirt roads
looking for deer.


573
00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:02.938
Deer crossed in front of him,

574
00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:06.459
Stanley jumped out with his
rifle, chasing the deer.


575
00:35:06.493 --> 00:35:09.186
And just as he was
chasing the deer,


576
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.122
fog and heavy rain
simultaneously hit that area


577
00:35:14.156 --> 00:35:15.640
where he disappeared into.

578
00:35:16.917 --> 00:35:19.886
And then he wanders,
apparently.


579
00:35:21.888 --> 00:35:26.548
I've started a seven-day search for Stanley.

580
00:35:26.582 --> 00:35:28.619
The canines can't
pick up the scent.


581
00:35:28.653 --> 00:35:30.379
Helicopters in the air
can't see him.


582
00:35:30.414 --> 00:35:32.933
Professional trackers
can't find any tracks.


583
00:35:35.488 --> 00:35:37.662
Fast forward five months later,

584
00:35:40.665 --> 00:35:43.185
and an off-duty New Mexico State police officer

585
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.946
and his son are fishing
on the Pecos River.


586
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.709
They find a body.

587
00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:54.058
He wasn't immediately
identified,


588
00:35:54.092 --> 00:35:56.854
but the coroner eventually
came around


589
00:35:56.888 --> 00:36:02.170
to say that it was
and that he had
some skull injuries


590
00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:03.274
and he had two broken ribs.

591
00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:06.070
Presumption was
that he drowned.


592
00:36:09.694 --> 00:36:14.492
Stanley's body was found
nine miles from
his point of separation.


593
00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:19.117
It's another weird
disappearance with this one
just happening.


594
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.707
Especially in these
cluster zones,


595
00:36:22.742 --> 00:36:24.985
this is one of those
recurring phenomena.


596
00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:30.059
It's going to happen again.
It's just a matter of time.


597
00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:33.787
In talking with Edna,

598
00:36:33.822 --> 00:36:36.825
one of the things they found in
Mel's jeep was his GPS.


599
00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:40.415
Now, that's an important device

600
00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:44.557
that will help you get back
to the point where you
started the hike


601
00:36:44.591 --> 00:36:47.870
and it's supposed to be
a trail guide for you.


602
00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:50.356
Now, personally,
I don't think it's unusual


603
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.081
that Mel didn't take that,

604
00:36:52.737 --> 00:36:54.291
because he knew in himself

605
00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:57.673
that he was only going to walk
a 100 or 150 yards
down that trail.


606
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:02.713
If you're going to purchase
a GPS device,


607
00:37:02.747 --> 00:37:05.302
consider it
your insurance plan.


608
00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:07.649
And this is an example

609
00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:11.446
of why you should always
carry that insurance plan with you

610
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.379
whenever you go
into the wilderness,


611
00:37:13.413 --> 00:37:16.140
hiking, hunting,
or sightseeing.


612
00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:21.732
BOB: We're paid to hunt
for a five-day period.


613
00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:23.837
So we make sure
people pack the right gear


614
00:37:23.872 --> 00:37:26.254
to be able to stay
in the field all five days.

615
00:37:26.288 --> 00:37:28.808
Therefore increase our odds
the highest possible.


616
00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:32.674
And so, our basic packing list

617
00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:36.402
that I expect hunters
to carry in the field


618
00:37:36.436 --> 00:37:40.302
has a hunting license
and has a bottle of water
they're drinking.


619
00:37:40.337 --> 00:37:42.753
It has a bottle of water
you're not planning
on drinking.


620
00:37:42.787 --> 00:37:44.168
It has a garbage bag.

621
00:37:44.202 --> 00:37:46.274
That's the most useful
wilderness tool
in the world


622
00:37:46.308 --> 00:37:50.312
for a raincoat, to sit on,
to pack something in.


623
00:37:50.347 --> 00:37:53.522
LAURAN: As a hunter,
you're like, "I'm fine.
I'm armed, I'm safe.


624
00:37:53.557 --> 00:37:56.767
I'm the baddest thing out
here because I have
a firearm with me."


625
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:58.631
And then, you read
more and more


626
00:37:58.665 --> 00:38:00.357
and these are people
that are more experienced.


627
00:38:00.391 --> 00:38:02.945
They've been in the woods
more than I have, you know?


628
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.432
There's no reason
for why these people go missing.


629
00:38:06.466 --> 00:38:09.607
And you're like, "Okay,
I'm going to pack
things differently."


630
00:38:09.642 --> 00:38:11.333
You change your whole mindset.

631
00:38:11.368 --> 00:38:13.680
Take advantage
of the technology
that you're given today.


632
00:38:13.715 --> 00:38:17.166
You've got the sat phone,
you've got GPS,
you've got all that.


633
00:38:17.201 --> 00:38:20.342
But then, if you don't
want to have to rely
on a cell phone signal,


634
00:38:20.377 --> 00:38:22.344
if your battery dies
or something like that,


635
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:24.898
you know, I've got a whistle,
I've got a knife.


636
00:38:24.933 --> 00:38:26.831
My knife's got a fire starter.

637
00:38:26.866 --> 00:38:28.005
It's just all about,

638
00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:29.972
"I'm going to be able
to take care of myself."


639
00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:32.527
You know, with the camouflage
patterns available today,


640
00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:35.737
you've got this one
on right here, it's going
to be hard to get spotted.


641
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:37.532
So, carry something
bright with you.


642
00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:39.085
This is a space blanket.

643
00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:42.157
And the reason I grab this
'cause it's fluorescent orange,


644
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:45.574
which is a universal
"here I am" code.


645
00:38:45.609 --> 00:38:47.335
DAVID: Tell somebody
where you're going.


646
00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:50.476
Tell somebody that is trusted that
is going to look after you

647
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.201
and tell them what time
you're going to be out.


648
00:38:52.236 --> 00:38:54.997
And if you're not out by then
and you're not calling them,


649
00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.240
say it's Lauran that you told,

650
00:38:56.274 --> 00:38:59.001
then Lauran you know
is going to call the authorities


651
00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.900
to come out there and look for
you. Super important.


652
00:39:00.934 --> 00:39:04.248
It is and I've heard you
say this many times.


653
00:39:04.282 --> 00:39:06.768
Especially writing
about Missing 411.


654
00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:08.942
Check the weather.

655
00:39:08.977 --> 00:39:12.498
If you do get lost,
it's common sense to stay put.

656
00:39:12.532 --> 00:39:14.500
Stay close
to where you started.


657
00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:17.123
Especially
if you told somebody.


658
00:39:17.157 --> 00:39:19.367
And you don't want to lay
your pack down,


659
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:22.956
but one thing I will never
compromise on is extra ammo.


660
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:25.545
There's a three-shot rule
that a lot of people might...


661
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.272
I don't even think
they still teach it
in hunter safety course.


662
00:39:28.306 --> 00:39:30.550
That's not where I learned it.
I learned it from him.


663
00:39:30.585 --> 00:39:34.243
And it's not only "I'm lost,
three shots, here's where I am."


664
00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:36.418
In addition to that,
if I go missing,


665
00:39:36.453 --> 00:39:38.696
and for whatever reason
I have that extra ammo,


666
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:40.422
I've used it up,
I've spent my shells,


667
00:39:40.457 --> 00:39:42.804
back at camp,
they can fire those three shots


668
00:39:42.838 --> 00:39:44.115
and you can tune into

669
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.255
"Okay, I need to turn around.
I need to do this."


670
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.913
If you are lost,
the best thing
you can possibly do


671
00:39:48.948 --> 00:39:51.433
is get yourself
into an opening.


672
00:39:51.468 --> 00:39:54.609
And I always tell people,
"Take your coat,
take something bright,


673
00:39:54.643 --> 00:39:57.888
and wave it around over the top
of your head in a big circle."


674
00:39:57.922 --> 00:39:59.407
Like a set of roller blades

675
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:01.926
or a rope that you're
spinning over your head.


676
00:40:01.961 --> 00:40:04.757
It's really, really easy
to see that from the air.


677
00:40:06.448 --> 00:40:11.557
Typically, we find,
either the person is alive,


678
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:14.974
or you know, deceased.

679
00:40:15.871 --> 00:40:19.012
Not very often
do we not find them.


680
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.625
JEANIE: The Crazy Mountains
are a geological upthrust


681
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.767
that is 300 million years
younger than
the Rocky Mountain range.


682
00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:51.838
So, they're not part of
the Rocky Mountain range.


683
00:40:51.873 --> 00:40:54.220
They're an isolated
island of mountains.


684
00:40:54.254 --> 00:40:56.118
CHARLIE: If you're
in the Crazies,


685
00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:58.120
I don't care where you're at
in the Crazies,


686
00:40:58.155 --> 00:41:01.192
if you follow a stream down

687
00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:04.713
you're going
to be somewhere soon.


688
00:41:04.748 --> 00:41:06.991
No matter where you are
in these mountains.


689
00:41:07.026 --> 00:41:10.892
Because they're just
an island chain of mountains.


690
00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:20.626
There are several versions of
why the Crazy Mountains
are called crazy.


691
00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:26.183
The one I believe is
it's a curse
from the Crow Indians.


692
00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.806
Because this used
to be Crow reservation


693
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:31.740
and when they were
moved off the land,


694
00:41:31.775 --> 00:41:35.503
the Crow Indians
supposedly put a curse
on the Crazy Mountains


695
00:41:35.537 --> 00:41:39.127
for the wind to blow
and drive the white man crazy.

696
00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:45.582
My name is Alan Ronneberg.

697
00:41:45.616 --> 00:41:50.000
I'm the Undersheriff with
the Sweetgrass County
Sheriff's Office.


698
00:41:50.034 --> 00:41:53.555
I'm also the Search
and Rescue coordinator.


699
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:58.560
I've actually been with
Search and Rescue
for 24 years.


700
00:41:58.595 --> 00:42:00.458
I grew up in this community.

701
00:42:00.493 --> 00:42:03.703
I've been here...
I'm 52 years old now.


702
00:42:03.738 --> 00:42:06.016
I've been here all my life.

703
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.950
My parents, grandparents,
great grandparents.


704
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.400
They've been here
since the 1880s.


705
00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:17.683
It's always been
an agricultural
and mining community.


706
00:42:17.717 --> 00:42:22.480
The family ranches have
been handed down for over
a hundred years


707
00:42:22.515 --> 00:42:24.310
to people that work here,

708
00:42:24.344 --> 00:42:27.071
raise their families here
and their kids stay here.


709
00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:31.282
And a fantastic place
to grow up.


710
00:42:32.939 --> 00:42:34.251
I'm Rebecca Rein.

711
00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:36.218
I'm Charlie Rein.

712
00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:41.154
And we live in Sweetgrass County
in Montana in the Crazies.


713
00:42:42.086 --> 00:42:43.605
DAVID: So, tell us about
the kind of wildlife


714
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.607
that we would expect to see
in the wilderness.


715
00:42:47.022 --> 00:42:49.956
CHARLIE: Deer, white tail,
and mule deer.


716
00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:52.338
Elk, black bear.

717
00:42:52.372 --> 00:42:55.272
I don't see many wolves,
but they're here.


718
00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.963
DAVID: So, no grizzlies
up there?


719
00:42:56.998 --> 00:42:58.620
REBECCA: Not that we know of.

720
00:42:58.655 --> 00:43:01.002
CHARLIE: Now, there have
been folks that say
they saw grizzlies.


721
00:43:01.036 --> 00:43:06.594
We don't have a resident
population of grizzly bears yet.


722
00:43:06.628 --> 00:43:09.458
I think they're coming,
but there's nothing now.


723
00:43:27.545 --> 00:43:30.307
DAVID: You know,
the Crazies themselves...


724
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.622
are unique.

725
00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:41.007
They are the youngest
mountain range
in the country.


726
00:43:41.042 --> 00:43:43.458
It's horrendously rugged.

727
00:43:43.492 --> 00:43:49.257
And you don't really
understand it
until you get into it.


728
00:44:18.217 --> 00:44:22.980
ALAN: What supposedly happened
as they started on the trail


729
00:44:23.015 --> 00:44:25.189
going up to Campfire Lake,

730
00:44:25.224 --> 00:44:26.708
they had a horse wreck.

731
00:44:26.743 --> 00:44:30.056
Their mule spooked
and started bucking
and throwing


732
00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:32.507
all their supplies
off the trail.


733
00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:35.027
All of Aaron's
camping equipment


734
00:44:35.061 --> 00:44:38.409
was basically on that mule.

735
00:44:38.444 --> 00:44:40.480
I know he lost
his sleeping bag.


736
00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:44.312
DAVID: And once they got
into Campfire Lake,
what happened?


737
00:44:45.244 --> 00:44:46.866
ALAN: They started their hunt.

738
00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:51.595
This was their base camp
and they went and hunted
from here.


739
00:44:52.458 --> 00:44:54.702
They were planning a week trip.

740
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:00.708
DAVID: Would you describe that
he had good common sense?

741
00:45:00.742 --> 00:45:03.020
CHRIS: Yeah, Aaron had
good common sense.


742
00:45:03.055 --> 00:45:05.264
Aaron wasn't a dummy.

743
00:45:05.298 --> 00:45:07.749
I mean, someone that comes up
here every other weekend,


744
00:45:07.784 --> 00:45:11.373
always hunts up here,
has stashes up here.


745
00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:14.204
He knows the area
like the back of his hand.


746
00:45:14.238 --> 00:45:18.553
ALAN: They spent two
days here at Campfire Lake.

747
00:45:18.587 --> 00:45:26.043
The one fellow had a cache here,
somewhere, below Sunlight Lake.


748
00:45:26.078 --> 00:45:32.049
So, Aaron was going to go up
the trail, to Sunlight,
into the cache


749
00:45:32.084 --> 00:45:34.431
and get what he needed.

750
00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.882
He was supposed to go up here,
grab the cache,


751
00:45:36.916 --> 00:45:39.056
and then come down
to his friends.


752
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:41.162
ALAN: Come back
into Campfire Lake.


753
00:45:50.723 --> 00:45:52.069
ALAN: Later that day,

754
00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:55.693
Nate had called Aaron
on the radio.


755
00:45:55.728 --> 00:45:56.764
He had a walkie-talkie?

756
00:45:56.798 --> 00:45:58.351
Yeah, a walkie-talkie.

757
00:45:58.386 --> 00:46:01.769
Yeah, I think it was a Garmin
Rino is what they call it.


758
00:46:01.803 --> 00:46:05.807
And on that Rino,
there's an LED screen


759
00:46:05.842 --> 00:46:09.535
and it also gives
the GPS position
of the person that's talking.


760
00:46:10.743 --> 00:46:13.401
As well as their position.
You know, back and forth.


761
00:46:14.298 --> 00:46:16.818
And when they did that,

762
00:46:16.853 --> 00:46:22.272
the GPS position showed him
on the very edge of the screen


763
00:46:22.306 --> 00:46:26.379
over in this area here,
on the main Sweetgrass trail.


764
00:46:26.414 --> 00:46:28.726
DAVID: Okay,
so that's confusing.


765
00:46:28.761 --> 00:46:30.936
When he gets to the fork
right here...


766
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.489
-ALAN: This fork?
-DAVID: Yeah.


767
00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:35.561
How evident is it that
there's a fork
in that trail to the lake?


768
00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:36.700
Very.

769
00:46:36.734 --> 00:46:38.288
So, it's real obvious.

770
00:46:38.322 --> 00:46:40.117
It's very obvious.

771
00:46:40.152 --> 00:46:43.465
DAVID: So, at this point,
where he's down
the trail over here,


772
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.984
he's next to a creek, right?

773
00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:46.296
Correct.

774
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.368
And the creek, everyone knows,
runs one direction.


775
00:46:49.402 --> 00:46:50.369
Correct.

776
00:46:50.403 --> 00:46:53.475
So, for him to get
disoriented right here,


777
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.892
and not know which direction
he was going on the trail


778
00:46:55.926 --> 00:46:57.031
doesn't make any sense.

779
00:46:57.065 --> 00:46:58.584
No.

780
00:46:58.618 --> 00:47:01.345
DAVID: At what point
do they realize
that he's missing?


781
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.692
ALAN: The next day actually.

782
00:47:03.727 --> 00:47:04.866
DAVID: Okay.

783
00:47:04.901 --> 00:47:07.489
ALAN: And they waited
for him for a day


784
00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.560
and then looked
for him for a day.


785
00:47:09.595 --> 00:47:12.667
And that's
when the storm starts.


786
00:47:12.701 --> 00:47:16.774
And the storm is coming
in from this way.


787
00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:17.845
DAVID: Gotcha.

788
00:47:17.879 --> 00:47:19.536
How much did it snow?

789
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.574
ALAN: Between 18 to 24 inches
within 12 hours.


790
00:47:23.609 --> 00:47:27.682
The temperature was
in the 40s and 50s


791
00:47:27.716 --> 00:47:30.719
and then, all of a sudden,
it was in the teens.


792
00:47:30.754 --> 00:47:33.412
And the snowstorm kinda
forced them out.


793
00:47:34.654 --> 00:47:38.866
We received a call from
one of the individuals


794
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.936
that was hunting with him,

795
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.285
saying that he was overdue
and hadn't come out.


796
00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:47.357
You know, they hadn't seen him
for a couple of days.


797
00:47:47.391 --> 00:47:49.428
When they told me
Campfire Lake, I said,


798
00:47:49.462 --> 00:47:51.740
"Well, you need to
get hold of Park County."


799
00:47:52.983 --> 00:47:55.710
DAVID: Park County goes out,
they start a search.


800
00:47:55.744 --> 00:47:58.161
ALAN: They start a search
in their county


801
00:47:58.195 --> 00:48:04.063
and we go ahead in kind of
a military blocking maneuver.


802
00:48:04.098 --> 00:48:08.757
You know, there's still

803
00:48:08.792 --> 00:48:11.036
The temperature is getting
better. It's warming up.


804
00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.005
We don't find anything.

805
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.213
There's a key point.

806
00:48:16.248 --> 00:48:19.285
So, as you guys were
coming up the trail,


807
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.425
you're not seeing
any footprints going out?


808
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.564
-Negative.
-DAVID: Right.


809
00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.290
We're here
from Sweetgrass County.


810
00:48:24.325 --> 00:48:26.706
MAN: Alan. Good to see you.

811
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:31.090
MARK: I believe it was
the second day
that I was working there.


812
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:33.472
I had landed with the deputy

813
00:48:33.506 --> 00:48:37.752
after dropping off two
separate dog teams.


814
00:48:37.786 --> 00:48:40.203
'Cause that terrain
is so steep and so deep,


815
00:48:40.237 --> 00:48:42.446
and very wild country.

816
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.103
Started up high,

817
00:48:44.138 --> 00:48:45.794
and they were going to work
the dog teams coming down,


818
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:51.455
and there was a girl
with her German shepherd,


819
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.907
I believe that found
a pair of boots.


820
00:48:54.942 --> 00:48:57.841
[WOMAN TALKING ON THE RADIO]

821
00:49:01.879 --> 00:49:04.330
[MAN TALKING ON THE RADIO]

822
00:49:08.852 --> 00:49:10.474
MAN 2: Roger.

823
00:49:10.509 --> 00:49:14.340
This will be the road
that Aaron and his two buddies

824
00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:17.861
drove in on to
pick up the horse trailer.

825
00:49:17.895 --> 00:49:22.003
I know they had two horses
and a mule.


826
00:49:28.803 --> 00:49:32.393
So, you guys, the horse wreck
happened right up
ahead of us.


827
00:49:33.842 --> 00:49:35.983
So, the trailer is over here
on the right side.


828
00:49:36.017 --> 00:49:37.087
On the right.

829
00:49:37.122 --> 00:49:39.193
Stays on this bench here
for a while.


830
00:49:39.227 --> 00:49:42.127
You get glimpses of it
whenever we go
through a meadow.


831
00:49:48.064 --> 00:49:49.824
We're going to make
a right-handed turn, fellas.


832
00:49:49.858 --> 00:49:51.722
And we're going to follow
the rest of the trail here.


833
00:49:51.757 --> 00:49:53.862
You can see where the trail
is right in front of you.

834
00:49:54.242 --> 00:49:55.485
The zig-zag.

835
00:49:56.382 --> 00:49:58.074
You're going
to reveal into Campfire


836
00:49:58.108 --> 00:50:01.560
as soon as you look
straight out on the outside
of this cliff.


837
00:50:03.527 --> 00:50:06.944
Their base camp. They're basing
out of Campfire Lake.


838
00:50:12.088 --> 00:50:14.642
So, when you come up here,
you sit up here in you spot


839
00:50:14.676 --> 00:50:16.851
and that's what
they were doing.
That spot...


840
00:50:16.885 --> 00:50:18.887
We saw elk
all the time over here.


841
00:50:18.922 --> 00:50:20.061
So, this is loaded.

842
00:50:23.927 --> 00:50:25.722
So, we'll go
down to the bottom.


843
00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:30.899
You can see this kind of
tough country


844
00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:33.212
even on the trail when
you kind of move through.

845
00:50:33.247 --> 00:50:36.422
-It is.
- It's a work out.


846
00:50:36.457 --> 00:50:40.047
Going up and down these trails
is one heck of a work out.

847
00:50:41.945 --> 00:50:44.706
-You could see
the trail easily.
-Yeah.


848
00:50:45.362 --> 00:50:46.708
And the trail is like this

849
00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:50.747
all the way from Campfire
over to Sweetgrass.


850
00:50:54.578 --> 00:50:58.099
This is the tee in the trail.

851
00:50:58.134 --> 00:51:00.584
Trail goes through
those rocks right there.


852
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.106
There was fresh snow
on the ground.


853
00:51:06.556 --> 00:51:09.455
It could have been easy
to miss that turn.


854
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.286
He left before it started
to snow, though.


855
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.597
-Oh, did he?
- Yeah.


856
00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:16.393
-Gotcha.
-I think it was bare ground.


857
00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:18.292
When he took off,

858
00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:22.261
it was actually
pretty warm out.


859
00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:24.815
Into the 50s at least.

860
00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:28.785
They were right
at the county line.


861
00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:32.616
We're coming into Sweetgrass
County and leaving Park County.

862
00:51:35.964 --> 00:51:37.966
A lot of boulder fields
through here.


863
00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:39.623
It is, yeah.

864
00:51:39.658 --> 00:51:42.592
And these are all loose.
These aren't set.


865
00:51:42.626 --> 00:51:44.421
They're all loose.

866
00:51:44.456 --> 00:51:46.458
You take one step forward

867
00:51:46.492 --> 00:51:49.806
and you slide two steps back
on each foot.


868
00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:53.016
So, in our search area,

869
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.984
that's what restricted
our search area so much.


870
00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:57.779
It was so small,

871
00:51:57.814 --> 00:52:01.611
because you can't get off of
the trail very far.


872
00:52:01.645 --> 00:52:04.165
You know,
you start going across
it's sharp.


873
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.237
If you don't have
a pair of hard sole boots,


874
00:52:07.272 --> 00:52:08.618
they're going to eat your feet.

875
00:52:09.481 --> 00:52:11.931
Even into the timber

876
00:52:11.966 --> 00:52:14.555
is loose rock
all over the place.


877
00:52:16.177 --> 00:52:20.147
Immediately from the boots,
there is a scree pile.


878
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:24.151
If he was barefoot,
he would have torn up
his feet immediately.


879
00:52:26.705 --> 00:52:28.638
Not to the falls, no.

880
00:52:28.672 --> 00:52:30.605
Well, we have to turn around
to see him better.


881
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.298
Yeah, this is the bench
of other falls


882
00:52:33.332 --> 00:52:35.507
where the boots were found.

883
00:52:40.477 --> 00:52:43.446
And this bench
is nice and subtle.


884
00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.206
It's kinda protected.

885
00:52:45.241 --> 00:52:46.483
A walk that way into the...

886
00:52:46.518 --> 00:52:49.003
And you're limited
where you can go.


887
00:52:52.006 --> 00:52:53.076
Right there.

888
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.011
-Yeah, he was right over there. 
-Those are trees.

889
00:52:57.045 --> 00:52:58.323
Those trees, yeah.

890
00:52:59.047 --> 00:53:00.325
Right in here.

891
00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:05.053
Close to the creek,
there are ways down


892
00:53:05.088 --> 00:53:07.918
into the creek
that you can do it.


893
00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:11.336
Especially underneath
the falls here.


894
00:53:13.234 --> 00:53:16.617
You can get into the...
Into this creek.


895
00:53:18.274 --> 00:53:22.864
Now, when we searched,
we searched this entire flat.


896
00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:24.245
After we found the boots,

897
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.215
we ticked through this
like nobody's business.


898
00:53:28.249 --> 00:53:29.664
I had a bunch of people

899
00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:32.598
and they... three searches

900
00:53:32.633 --> 00:53:34.082
is what we did.

901
00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:42.194
ALAN: So, we had evidence here.

902
00:53:42.229 --> 00:53:46.543
At the falls, we find... 
See, there's the pair of boots,

903
00:53:46.578 --> 00:53:51.134
I mean, set purposely
side by side.


904
00:53:51.168 --> 00:53:54.896
ALAN: Next to that
is basically a water bladder,

905
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:58.935
like a Camelbak water bladder.

906
00:54:00.108 --> 00:54:03.146
Just off the trail,
there is a fire pit.


907
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:08.427
In that fire pit was
a partially burnt
cigarette container


908
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:11.879
that we knew was Aaron's brand.

909
00:54:11.913 --> 00:54:14.640
Also in the immediate vicinity,

910
00:54:14.675 --> 00:54:19.645
a fire bundle partially burnt.

911
00:54:21.406 --> 00:54:24.098
Alongside that,

912
00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:27.929
in the fire pit
were two waist belts


913
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.587
from a backpack.

914
00:54:30.622 --> 00:54:33.418
DAVID: Straps that
come around the back


915
00:54:33.452 --> 00:54:34.798
-and sits on your hips.
-Correct.


916
00:54:34.833 --> 00:54:35.972
Is that what
we're talking about?


917
00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.491
That's what
we're talking about. Correct.


918
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:39.320
DAVID: Why would anybody
take those off?


919
00:54:39.355 --> 00:54:41.046
ALAN: Cut 'em off,

920
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.773
there's a little bit of
insulation in there
because they're padded.


921
00:54:43.807 --> 00:54:45.430
And you can slip
your hand in there


922
00:54:45.464 --> 00:54:47.121
for a little bit of protection.

923
00:54:47.155 --> 00:54:48.018
Right.

924
00:54:48.053 --> 00:54:49.710
That's the first thing
we thought of.


925
00:54:50.814 --> 00:54:55.094
That's about the only thing
that made any sense.


926
00:54:55.129 --> 00:54:58.753
Why a person would take
that waist belt off.


927
00:54:58.788 --> 00:55:01.411
DAVID: That must have been
a little confusing
to the searchers.


928
00:55:01.446 --> 00:55:02.654
ALAN: Absolutely.

929
00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:05.070
Plus...

930
00:55:06.382 --> 00:55:09.454
I throw another little bit of
rankle in there,


931
00:55:09.488 --> 00:55:13.147
they were up in the same spot

932
00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:16.357
a day or two days before
and never saw it.


933
00:55:16.392 --> 00:55:17.462
Never saw those items.

934
00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:19.464
Never came across those items.

935
00:55:19.498 --> 00:55:20.430
Same spot?

936
00:55:20.465 --> 00:55:22.708
Same people, same spot.

937
00:55:22.743 --> 00:55:25.642
And they said that
they never saw those boots.


938
00:55:25.677 --> 00:55:27.057
They never saw any of that.

939
00:55:27.644 --> 00:55:28.921
How is that possible?

940
00:55:30.682 --> 00:55:31.924
I don't know.

941
00:55:34.271 --> 00:55:36.343
These are seasoned guys.

942
00:55:36.377 --> 00:55:38.137
They do good at their jobs.

943
00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:41.175
They're SARTECH II
rated by NASAR.


944
00:55:41.209 --> 00:55:42.866
They know what the heck
they're doing.


945
00:55:45.213 --> 00:55:48.631
When they see
the waist belt cut off,


946
00:55:48.665 --> 00:55:52.013
and then the items laid out.

947
00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.846
It's starting to look
like hypothermia.


948
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.194
If you look at evidence
from hypothermia cases


949
00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:02.852
in the wild,

950
00:56:02.886 --> 00:56:05.199
or in remote areas,

951
00:56:05.233 --> 00:56:10.031
this is kind of the behavior
that you see.


952
00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:13.069
So, I narrow my search
both sides of the creek,


953
00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:17.280
all the way as far up
on the slope as I can get.


954
00:56:17.314 --> 00:56:18.868
Because we didn't think

955
00:56:18.902 --> 00:56:21.664
if he was bad enough
that he was leaving stuff,


956
00:56:21.698 --> 00:56:24.391
he wasn't going to get very far.

957
00:56:24.425 --> 00:56:27.877
So, somebody who is that
hypothermic isn't going
to go very far.


958
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:29.948
You wouldn't think so. No.

959
00:56:29.982 --> 00:56:32.226
So, the area East of the falls.

960
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.297
You guys covered
that pretty thick.


961
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.712
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

962
00:56:35.747 --> 00:56:38.128
We turned over everything.

963
00:56:38.163 --> 00:56:39.578
And you're a former K-9 handler.

964
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:40.717
Correct.

965
00:56:40.752 --> 00:56:42.478
DAVID: So, did the dogs
hit on anything?


966
00:56:43.893 --> 00:56:45.412
-ALAN: No.
-DAVID: Nothing?


967
00:56:45.446 --> 00:56:46.447
ALAN: Nothing.

968
00:57:10.506 --> 00:57:14.717
CHARLIE: Well, every spring
we maintain our fences,


969
00:57:14.751 --> 00:57:17.133
you know, so we can graze our
cattle the way we want to.


970
00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.583
So, it's just an annual
spring thing.


971
00:57:18.617 --> 00:57:22.103
And my father-in-law was here. 
He just happened to be with me.

972
00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:26.487
And just, you can see
the ridge up there,


973
00:57:26.522 --> 00:57:29.732
where a section of fence runs
between us and our neighbors


974
00:57:29.766 --> 00:57:32.424
and just annual routine

975
00:57:32.459 --> 00:57:36.911
and I was going over the fence
and he was kind of hiking
around and...


976
00:57:36.946 --> 00:57:40.846
REBECCA: He looked down
and he saw
an orange vest.


977
00:57:40.881 --> 00:57:42.572
So, he went down
just to go pick it up.


978
00:57:42.607 --> 00:57:46.749
And then, that's when he proceeded
to find the backpack and everything else.

979
00:57:46.783 --> 00:57:49.027
So in his mind, he thought,

980
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:51.478
"Well, what hunter
lost his stuff up here?"


981
00:57:53.514 --> 00:57:56.379
CHARLIE: And he comes
down off of there
just like...


982
00:57:56.413 --> 00:57:58.139
Grinning from ear
to ear, just...


983
00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.970
"Hey, was there a hunter
lost up here?"


984
00:58:01.004 --> 00:58:04.042
I'm like, "Yeah,
actually there was."


985
00:58:04.076 --> 00:58:08.840
"Oh, cool! His license
is still in here in his pack."


986
00:58:08.874 --> 00:58:12.326
"Okay." So, I look at it
and it was Aaron Hedges'.


987
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.052
DAVID: Did you
recognize the name?


988
00:58:14.086 --> 00:58:15.640
Oh, yeah.
I recognized the name.


989
00:58:15.674 --> 00:58:18.815
I mean, there were helicopters
flying way up
the valley up there


990
00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:22.198
and a big searching
that was in the local press.


991
00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:25.857
DAVID: And inside
was there any food?


992
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:27.893
CHARLIE: There were snack bars.

993
00:58:27.928 --> 00:58:29.550
DAVID: There was
nutrition inside?


994
00:58:29.585 --> 00:58:31.000
BOTH: Yes.

995
00:58:31.034 --> 00:58:32.657
Correct me if I'm wrong,

996
00:58:32.691 --> 00:58:35.418
but the backpack, I understand,
was actually leaning
against a tree.


997
00:58:35.452 --> 00:58:36.557
Correct.

998
00:58:36.592 --> 00:58:38.628
So, somebody just didn't
strip it off and drop it.


999
00:58:38.663 --> 00:58:39.560
No.

1000
00:58:39.595 --> 00:58:41.286
They put it there with intent.

1001
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.184
ALAN: They put it there
with intent. They put it
there purposely


1002
00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.979
and it was protected.

1003
00:58:45.014 --> 00:58:46.912
DAVID: Okay, and what was
in the backpack?


1004
00:58:46.947 --> 00:58:48.569
I understand you found a gun.

1005
00:58:48.604 --> 00:58:49.812
ALAN: Correct.

1006
00:58:49.846 --> 00:58:52.193
A .44 Ruger Redhawk
I believe it was.


1007
00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.023
-DAVID: Find a bow?
-ALAN: Yes.


1008
00:58:54.057 --> 00:58:56.335
It was alongside
the backpack evidently.


1009
00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:59.442
In our search,
another interesting point,
I guess...


1010
00:59:01.202 --> 00:59:03.688
When we searched this area,

1011
00:59:04.758 --> 00:59:07.830
here, at the head
of this ridge,


1012
00:59:07.864 --> 00:59:10.764
where it starts to drop off,

1013
00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:13.145
was a cup. A Thermos cup.

1014
00:59:13.905 --> 00:59:15.251
And beside that cup

1015
00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:19.082
was an open energy drink.

1016
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:22.223
Somebody had, you know,

1017
00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:27.435
had basically sat down
and drank a cup of tea.


1018
00:59:30.059 --> 00:59:31.405
That's an odd sight.

1019
00:59:31.439 --> 00:59:32.579
Uh-huh.

1020
00:59:32.613 --> 00:59:34.028
Yeah, absolutely.

1021
00:59:34.063 --> 00:59:35.409
What do you think
when you see that?


1022
00:59:37.411 --> 00:59:39.758
"What the hell
is this guy doing?"


1023
00:59:39.793 --> 00:59:46.247
And from this point,
you could see
the Rein buildings.


1024
00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.455
DAVID: From where the cup is?

1025
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:51.598
Yes, absolutely.
I mean, they're right there.


1026
00:59:51.632 --> 00:59:53.738
They're right down there.

1027
00:59:53.772 --> 00:59:55.222
DAVID: And could you see a road?

1028
00:59:55.256 --> 00:59:56.119
Yes.

1029
00:59:56.844 --> 00:59:58.259
Does that make any sense to you?

1030
00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:01.608
No, it doesn't, because...

1031
01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:04.403
Well, I don't know
if it makes sense to me or not,


1032
01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:05.577
but it is funny.

1033
01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:08.304
DAVID: So, you don't find
a body after your search.


1034
01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:09.754
No.

1035
01:00:09.788 --> 01:00:12.135
No, we couldn't cover
a large area


1036
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.655
and we didn't
have a lot of time
to be able to do that.


1037
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.484
There wasn't a life or death
situation at this point?


1038
01:00:16.519 --> 01:00:19.729
No, not at that point.
It was evidence recovery.


1039
01:00:19.764 --> 01:00:23.319
So, how far does it go on
for the next thing to happen?


1040
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.217
Another year.

1041
01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:29.256
Off of the Sweetgrass ranch,

1042
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:32.362
which is a dude ranch,
they have a dude ride.


1043
01:00:32.397 --> 01:00:35.158
A string of dudes
who were guests at the ranch


1044
01:00:35.193 --> 01:00:37.126
were on this ride.

1045
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.509
And as they come up the hill,

1046
01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:43.477
on a little bench,

1047
01:00:43.511 --> 01:00:46.135
one of the guests
looks over and goes,


1048
01:00:46.169 --> 01:00:48.689
"Hey, there's
a skull over there."


1049
01:00:48.724 --> 01:00:52.417
And lo and behold, there's a
human skull underneath a tree.


1050
01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:58.526
I mean, just pretty as a
picture, bright as a penny,


1051
01:00:58.561 --> 01:00:59.700
underneath a dead tree.

1052
01:01:00.805 --> 01:01:02.047
Did you go back out?

1053
01:01:02.082 --> 01:01:03.152
Sure did.

1054
01:01:03.186 --> 01:01:04.878
And what did you find?

1055
01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:09.779
We find the skulls
and the remains


1056
01:01:09.814 --> 01:01:11.401
and where we find that...

1057
01:01:12.023 --> 01:01:14.404
is right here.

1058
01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:18.892
We did find the pelvis
and one femur


1059
01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:22.309
on a cow trail,
partially buried.


1060
01:01:22.343 --> 01:01:24.829
I did find Aaron's cell phone.

1061
01:01:24.863 --> 01:01:29.834
A jacket, like what you're
wearing, a thin jacket.


1062
01:01:29.868 --> 01:01:31.007
Any pants?

1063
01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:32.526
Pants? No.

1064
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.252
I don't believe
we found any pants.


1065
01:01:34.286 --> 01:01:35.736
-I can't remember.
-Socks?


1066
01:01:37.634 --> 01:01:40.603
No, because we didn't find
any feet.


1067
01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.536
No feet?

1068
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.813
Right.

1069
01:01:43.848 --> 01:01:46.505
Did any of his bones appear
to be broken like his femurs?


1070
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.714
No.

1071
01:01:47.748 --> 01:01:50.717
Did the coroner come up
with any cause of death?


1072
01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:52.615
No.

1073
01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:02.936
He could have seen the creek?

1074
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.697
CHARLIE: Yes, he could
have seen the creek.


1075
01:02:05.732 --> 01:02:07.699
So, there he had water.

1076
01:02:07.734 --> 01:02:10.288
I understand that there was also
a lighter in his backpack?


1077
01:02:10.322 --> 01:02:12.186
I think so, yeah, probably.

1078
01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:13.740
So, he could have made fire.

1079
01:02:15.155 --> 01:02:16.673
He had a gun,
he could have signaled help.


1080
01:02:18.089 --> 01:02:19.607
He had food,
e could have eaten.


1081
01:02:20.263 --> 01:02:21.437
DAVID: Well, you're a nurse.

1082
01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:22.714
Yes.

1083
01:02:22.749 --> 01:02:25.752
So, you understand hypothermia
and how it affects the body.


1084
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.961
That distance...

1085
01:02:27.995 --> 01:02:29.790
Somebody said,
"Well, he was hypothermic


1086
01:02:29.825 --> 01:02:32.310
way back at the falls.
That's why he took
his boots off."


1087
01:02:32.344 --> 01:02:34.553
Okay, great,
we're hypothermic then.


1088
01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.970
How in the heck are you going to
make it all that distance?


1089
01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.592
You know,
that's the other thing.


1090
01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:41.629
If he was hypothermic,
why didn't he drop his bow?


1091
01:02:43.114 --> 01:02:44.425
Why was he still packing it?

1092
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.290
That's a heavy thing to be
packing in your backpack.


1093
01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.638
This all doesn't add up to me.

1094
01:02:51.122 --> 01:02:52.261
Nope.

1095
01:02:52.295 --> 01:02:53.849
Does it add up
to you in any way?


1096
01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:56.299
No.

1097
01:02:56.955 --> 01:02:59.993
ALAN: No. You go through

1098
01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:02.409
your lost person behavior,

1099
01:03:02.443 --> 01:03:06.654
your behavior is,
exposure takes a hold of you


1100
01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.484
and...

1101
01:03:10.175 --> 01:03:13.213
it just...
None of it makes any sense.


1102
01:03:17.804 --> 01:03:20.979
DAVID: There's two things that bothered
me most about the Hedges' case.

1103
01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:22.360
First I'd like to know

1104
01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:25.156
what caused Aaron to change
course so drastically?


1105
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.296
Even if he had missed
the turn to the cache,

1106
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.125
he'd eventually known
he had gone too far


1107
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.819
merely by the fact that
he's walking adjacent
to the creek


1108
01:03:32.853 --> 01:03:34.303
that's flowing downhill,

1109
01:03:34.337 --> 01:03:37.306
away from the location
he's supposed to be in.


1110
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.516
This was an experienced
hunter who hunted here often.

1111
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.519
And this was a full two days
before any bad weather.


1112
01:03:44.382 --> 01:03:45.728
The second major issue

1113
01:03:45.762 --> 01:03:48.317
is his body being found
six miles from the falls,


1114
01:03:48.351 --> 01:03:52.355
where he apparently shed his
boots under the theory of
extreme hypothermia.


1115
01:03:53.184 --> 01:03:54.633
Somehow, while hypothermic,

1116
01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.532
he carries his bow,
his backpack,


1117
01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.983
a jacket, his cell phone
and thermos


1118
01:03:59.017 --> 01:04:02.676
six miles through
a foot and a half to three
feet of fresh snow


1119
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:03.988
with no shoes.

1120
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:07.681
Then sits on a rock
overlooking safety.


1121
01:04:09.062 --> 01:04:10.511
His remains were found 11 miles

1122
01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.548
from the camp
he was supposed to return to.


1123
01:04:14.722 --> 01:04:15.758
It's too much.

1124
01:04:16.932 --> 01:04:18.381
This is one strange case.

1125
01:04:20.867 --> 01:04:22.661
I never take those mountains
for granted.


1126
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:25.526
Every time I drive home
from the East,


1127
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:28.875
it's like, "There they are.
There's our mountains."


1128
01:04:28.909 --> 01:04:30.152
It's the best place on Earth.

1129
01:04:30.186 --> 01:04:32.085
You know, it's the prettiest
place on Earth.


1130
01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:33.569
We're prejudiced.

1131
01:05:19.339 --> 01:05:20.788
Where we are, here in Sonora,

1132
01:05:20.823 --> 01:05:24.413
you see
the remnants of the 1800s


1133
01:05:24.447 --> 01:05:26.449
in just about every place.

1134
01:05:26.484 --> 01:05:28.589
It's an old mining town.

1135
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:39.428
Sonora is kind of
at the lower foothills
of the mountain.


1136
01:05:39.462 --> 01:05:41.637
And as you head Eastbound,

1137
01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.984
heading up into the forest,

1138
01:05:44.019 --> 01:05:47.056
the dense,
you know, wild forests


1139
01:05:47.091 --> 01:05:48.644
where there is no more cities,

1140
01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.612
it becomes even clearer to you

1141
01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:54.788
that this place is not like
other places.


1142
01:05:54.822 --> 01:05:58.999
There is sort of
a strange sense of mystery


1143
01:05:59.034 --> 01:06:00.104
that abounds.

1144
01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:16.361
My name is Giuseppe Ricapito.

1145
01:06:16.396 --> 01:06:18.708
I am a police
and courts reporter


1146
01:06:18.743 --> 01:06:20.641
here at The Union Democrat
newspaper


1147
01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:23.023
in Sonora,
Tuolumne County, California.


1148
01:06:23.058 --> 01:06:26.647
So, in a county like this,
do you have a lot of homicides?


1149
01:06:27.476 --> 01:06:29.167
Not necessarily.

1150
01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:32.101
There's been a handful,

1151
01:06:32.136 --> 01:06:33.654
maybe in the past
couple of years


1152
01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:36.864
and none of them were unsolved.

1153
01:06:36.899 --> 01:06:40.454
Your county goes all the way up
into the high mountain
area, correct?


1154
01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:42.387
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, it spreads
all the way over


1155
01:06:42.422 --> 01:06:44.665
into the Sierra
Nevada mountain range


1156
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.047
all the way to Sonora Pass.

1157
01:06:47.082 --> 01:06:50.844
DAVID: There's a gorgeous
lookout up there.
Tell us about that.


1158
01:06:50.878 --> 01:06:53.674
GIUSEPPE: If you are traveling up that corridor

1159
01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.746
which passes through
the county, Highway 108,


1160
01:06:56.781 --> 01:07:00.026
you basically advance
up a steep grade.


1161
01:07:02.925 --> 01:07:06.687
You're fascinated by, like,
how lush it is, right?


1162
01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:09.242
The wildlife, the trees.

1163
01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:13.177
And as you wind up
further and further
up this grade,


1164
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:16.525
you get the feeling like
you've lost it,
or you're lost,


1165
01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:21.012
like you're never going to
find it, because it's a
single turn off,


1166
01:07:21.047 --> 01:07:23.946
a single sign
pointing you to the left.


1167
01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.055
It's called Donnell Vista.

1168
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:32.506
And, it's sort of,
I've been thinking about it.


1169
01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:34.577
It's, like, etched
into the mountain side.


1170
01:07:38.202 --> 01:07:40.618
If you're standing there
at the lookout point, right,


1171
01:07:40.652 --> 01:07:42.723
and you're
overlooking that area,


1172
01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:46.900
you're seeing these crags of
rock jutting out


1173
01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:51.387
and I couldn't even
tell you how far


1174
01:07:51.422 --> 01:07:54.632
the blips of a river
far down below.


1175
01:07:56.668 --> 01:07:58.808
As you look over,
you say to yourself,


1176
01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:01.432
"If you fall down here,
you're not going to survive."


1177
01:08:15.618 --> 01:08:17.241
We just left the vista.

1178
01:08:17.275 --> 01:08:18.828
Just a quarter mile East,

1179
01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:22.108
Breck Phelps' vehicle was found

1180
01:08:22.142 --> 01:08:23.178
at this turnout.

1181
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.390
Under the small, old dirt road,

1182
01:08:28.424 --> 01:08:30.668
that eventually leads
and turns into a trail


1183
01:08:30.702 --> 01:08:32.532
down by the Stanislaus river.

1184
01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:50.170
DAVID: His pastor found
the vehicle here


1185
01:08:50.205 --> 01:08:53.622
because he knew Breck had fished
here in the past.


1186
01:08:53.656 --> 01:08:55.796
And that's where
the search started.


1187
01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:59.283
They brought in Cobra
helicopters, four dog teams.


1188
01:08:59.317 --> 01:09:00.663
There was even some bad weather

1189
01:09:00.698 --> 01:09:03.149
that hindered the search
for a short period of time.


1190
01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:09.189
They found nothing
after many days
of looking for the man.


1191
01:09:09.224 --> 01:09:10.535
He was never found.

1192
01:09:14.056 --> 01:09:18.129
The strangest thing about
Breck Phelps' disappearance


1193
01:09:18.164 --> 01:09:21.650
was that it seemed to align
or parallel itself


1194
01:09:21.684 --> 01:09:23.514
to the previous disappearances

1195
01:09:23.548 --> 01:09:25.826
that had happened
in that same region.


1196
01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:28.691
Patti Sue Tolhurst
and Nita Mayo


1197
01:09:28.726 --> 01:09:33.040
both commonly like Breck Phelps, left their car,

1198
01:09:33.075 --> 01:09:35.698
within a quarter mile
of that vista point.


1199
01:09:41.083 --> 01:09:44.362
DAVID: The true oddity
of this location


1200
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.364
is that we have three people

1201
01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:48.849
in eleven years
that have disappeared


1202
01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:51.058
from essentially one spot.

1203
01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:54.200
That is very odd.

1204
01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:58.514
GIUSEPPE: It's easy to say
these people slipped on a rock

1205
01:09:58.549 --> 01:10:01.172
and they fell into
the river canyon, right?


1206
01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:04.071
But then, why haven't we
found remains?


1207
01:10:05.349 --> 01:10:08.214
DAVID: When you're walking
on the paved path,


1208
01:10:08.248 --> 01:10:11.355
you've got boulders
all around you.


1209
01:10:11.389 --> 01:10:15.221
And it's something that
I've written about
hundreds of times.


1210
01:10:15.255 --> 01:10:16.532
You just can't ignore it.

1211
01:10:16.567 --> 01:10:18.879
And here,
it raises its face again


1212
01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:21.917
right amongst a cluster of
missing people.


1213
01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:43.110
DAVID: Did you ask the
Sheriff what their feelings were?

1214
01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:47.149
The Sheriff's Office
doesn't like to speculate.


1215
01:10:47.183 --> 01:10:50.980
The Sheriff's Office is a real
cut and dry,


1216
01:10:51.015 --> 01:10:54.398
black and white,
we found him, or we didn't,


1217
01:10:54.432 --> 01:10:56.814
this case is open
until it's closed.


1218
01:10:56.848 --> 01:10:59.955
The one thing that I wanted to
bring up is, in April,


1219
01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.613
before the disappearance
of Breck Phelps.


1220
01:11:02.647 --> 01:11:05.754
In April 2016,
they did find human remains


1221
01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:07.928
over in that area.

1222
01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.622
They didn't match
Patti Sue Tolhurst,


1223
01:11:11.656 --> 01:11:12.968
not did they match Nita Mayo.

1224
01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:15.004
They tested the dental records.

1225
01:11:15.039 --> 01:11:17.904
It was just like,
what are these?


1226
01:11:17.938 --> 01:11:20.320
And this was before the
disappearance of Breck Phelps.


1227
01:11:20.355 --> 01:11:21.425
Did they ever ID the remains?

1228
01:11:21.459 --> 01:11:22.771
No.

1229
01:11:22.805 --> 01:11:24.013
So, we don't know who it was?

1230
01:11:24.048 --> 01:11:25.636
No.

1231
01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:28.121
People aren't talking about
this story anymore.


1232
01:11:28.155 --> 01:11:32.988
The news cycle being very, you
know, I'm doing
two stories a day!


1233
01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:35.128
But if it does happen again,

1234
01:11:35.162 --> 01:11:37.751
people are going
to be reminded
of these past stories


1235
01:11:37.786 --> 01:11:39.960
and it's going to
only increase speculation


1236
01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:44.137
and increase
the sense of concern.


1237
01:11:44.171 --> 01:11:47.968
Now, if you just step out
from this area a little further,


1238
01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:51.627
there's also a larger cluster

1239
01:11:51.662 --> 01:11:53.146
in geographical area

1240
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.528
where there's
three people missing


1241
01:11:55.562 --> 01:11:57.944
so close
to Yosemite National Park


1242
01:11:57.978 --> 01:12:01.050
and the biggest cluster of
missing people in the world.


1243
01:12:02.224 --> 01:12:05.020
I don't know why,
I don't know where,


1244
01:12:05.503 --> 01:12:06.642
I don't know how,

1245
01:12:06.677 --> 01:12:10.405
but I don't think
it's a coincidence.


1246
01:12:12.407 --> 01:12:13.684
Now, within this region,

1247
01:12:13.718 --> 01:12:16.687
there's a hunting camp
dating back to the 1950s.


1248
01:12:16.721 --> 01:12:18.171
Over the years,

1249
01:12:18.205 --> 01:12:20.518
the hunters have experienced
something highly unusual.


1250
01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:24.280
And by proximity alone,
this is worth investigating.


1251
01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:40.573
And just so people can get
some idea,


1252
01:12:40.607 --> 01:12:42.678
we're not that far
outside Yosemite.


1253
01:12:42.713 --> 01:12:44.059
MOREHEAD: We're not far at all.

1254
01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.751
I tell people we're in
between Yosemite
and Tahoe.


1255
01:12:47.442 --> 01:12:48.857
Yeah, that's where we are.

1256
01:12:48.891 --> 01:12:51.031
We're in a 6000 feet elevation,

1257
01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:53.379
you're hiking
close to 10000 feet


1258
01:12:53.413 --> 01:12:55.519
before you start dropping back,
you know, up and down.

1259
01:12:57.417 --> 01:13:00.386
The whole topography up there
changes every year,


1260
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.215
you don't know what to expect.

1261
01:13:02.249 --> 01:13:04.217
You don't know what...
across the trail


1262
01:13:04.251 --> 01:13:05.598
that you have to work your
way around.


1263
01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:09.395
You really need to know
which trails to get here.


1264
01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:12.708
And if you don't know
where it's at,
you'll never find it.


1265
01:13:12.743 --> 01:13:14.123
It's just one of those places.

1266
01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.928
DAVID: What year did
the Sierra Camp start?


1267
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.691
MOREHEAD: The camp's been here since the 50s.

1268
01:13:29.725 --> 01:13:32.176
I didn't start coming
up till 1971.


1269
01:13:35.075 --> 01:13:37.319
DAVID: And do you know
what brought 'em to this spot?

1270
01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.909
MOREHEAD: This is one
of those spots that


1271
01:13:40.943 --> 01:13:43.429
Warren used to say this is
as close to heaven as
you think you'll ever get.


1272
01:13:48.951 --> 01:13:50.919
It's so remote.

1273
01:13:50.953 --> 01:13:54.094
The deer are plentiful.
There's a lot of bear up here.


1274
01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:57.028
It's pristine,
a lot of granite.


1275
01:13:58.271 --> 01:14:00.066
Fresh water coming right out of the ground,

1276
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.964
especially where
the spring starts.


1277
01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:05.623
There's a lot of rivers
and it's just a gorgeous
place to be in.


1278
01:14:10.628 --> 01:14:12.596
We're a very sober cap.

1279
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:14.321
A very strict camp.

1280
01:14:14.356 --> 01:14:17.773
We don't unload
before you came into camp.


1281
01:14:17.808 --> 01:14:19.188
No alcohol in here.

1282
01:14:19.223 --> 01:14:22.260
It was really a quite
disciplined camp.


1283
01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:25.022
All the guys were
professional people,


1284
01:14:25.056 --> 01:14:27.576
so we kept going on up here.

1285
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:28.784
What it was, we don't know,

1286
01:14:28.819 --> 01:14:32.512
but had it to ourselves
for a long time.


1287
01:14:32.547 --> 01:14:35.791
DAVID: And what was the average success
rate for you guys coming up here?

1288
01:14:35.826 --> 01:14:38.138
MOREHEAD: The deer was

1289
01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.830
We never didn't get a deer.

1290
01:14:39.864 --> 01:14:42.004
It's that kind of a place.

1291
01:14:56.432 --> 01:14:59.884
We really didn't realize
what we were dealing with.


1292
01:14:59.919 --> 01:15:01.334
We still don't know
what we're dealing with,


1293
01:15:01.368 --> 01:15:03.405
but it's something
very unusual.


1294
01:15:05.062 --> 01:15:08.341
Strange things happened and
most of the stuff happened

1295
01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:12.103
in the evening time, just at
dusk, nightime, like now.


1296
01:15:16.522 --> 01:15:19.835
The first time I ever heard
anything was later in '71.


1297
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.043
I came back up with the guys

1298
01:15:21.078 --> 01:15:25.151
and we were here by the stove.

1299
01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:27.015
There was a stove here then.

1300
01:15:27.049 --> 01:15:30.363
And as soon as it starts
getting dark, we'd go in.


1301
01:15:30.397 --> 01:15:32.848
Sometimes we might hear a grunt or a whoop or...
[MAKES A SOUND]

1302
01:15:32.883 --> 01:15:34.505
or blowing sounds like that

1303
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.577
and that's when you know
you want to get inside
the shelter


1304
01:15:37.612 --> 01:15:39.337
because you still don't know
what you're dealing with.


1305
01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:42.548
Whatever it is, it's big.
Very, very big.


1306
01:15:42.582 --> 01:15:46.034
We would all go inside,
close the shelter's door


1307
01:15:46.068 --> 01:15:48.830
and that's a log we would put
in between these trees


1308
01:15:48.864 --> 01:15:51.039
and then strap it inside
with cable.


1309
01:15:51.073 --> 01:15:54.214
And then, they would start
making their sounds.


1310
01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:57.183
That was in 1971, when
I first started hearing them


1311
01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:58.702
and we started recording them.

1312
01:16:04.639 --> 01:16:06.951
[STRANGE SOUNDS]

1313
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:37.352
MOREHEAD: We were all talking
about, "Maybe I can
figure out a way out."


1314
01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:40.320
You're just sitting there
and all of you are petrified.


1315
01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.771
You're just waiting
for the wall to break open


1316
01:17:42.806 --> 01:17:44.497
and something to reach in there
and grab you.


1317
01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:46.706
Hold you up and...

1318
01:17:46.741 --> 01:17:49.157
Waiting for the light
to break in through
the cracks of the walls


1319
01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:51.435
and it never happened.

1320
01:17:52.332 --> 01:17:53.713
That's the strange part,

1321
01:17:53.748 --> 01:17:56.233
'cause you hear it over there,
but you don't see it over there.


1322
01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:59.685
As time went on, '72,
same thing.


1323
01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:02.791
We thought something might be
trying to scare us out.


1324
01:18:02.826 --> 01:18:05.000
Maybe this is their territory.

1325
01:18:05.035 --> 01:18:06.692
We don't know, we can only guess

1326
01:18:06.726 --> 01:18:09.591
why they were doing
what they were doing.


1327
01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:12.698
But they were observing us,
that's for sure.


1328
01:18:20.706 --> 01:18:23.605
What we do know is that
their vocal range


1329
01:18:23.639 --> 01:18:26.781
is much greater
than human beings.


1330
01:18:27.782 --> 01:18:31.509
Their frequencies go way above

1331
01:18:31.544 --> 01:18:34.236
and way below
the abilities of humans.


1332
01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:45.420
SCOTT: I was trained in all
of the deceptive practices


1333
01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.147
in voice and communications.

1334
01:18:49.596 --> 01:18:52.220
Besides the fact
that you have the creatures


1335
01:18:52.254 --> 01:18:55.568
stepping on each other
in their conversational turns,


1336
01:18:56.396 --> 01:19:00.090
you have humans, like Ron,

1337
01:19:00.124 --> 01:19:03.610
stepping on the creatures
back and forth,


1338
01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:07.269
overlapping their voices
on the tapes.


1339
01:19:07.925 --> 01:19:09.306
It can't be faked.

1340
01:19:10.238 --> 01:19:12.240
Not in 1974.

1341
01:19:13.344 --> 01:19:15.899
Plus, it would be
extremely dangerous


1342
01:19:16.831 --> 01:19:18.418
to come up here at night,

1343
01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:21.421
into a camp
full of well armed hunters.


1344
01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:24.770
They don't go to bed at
night without their guns at their sides.

1345
01:19:26.081 --> 01:19:28.256
It's ridiculous to think of it.

1346
01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:29.636
You wouldn't do it.
You wouldn't do it


1347
01:19:29.671 --> 01:19:31.673
just to hoax a bunch of
hunters up here.


1348
01:19:32.847 --> 01:19:35.746
DAVID: So, from a 100 percent
factual standpoint,


1349
01:19:35.781 --> 01:19:40.855
we really don't know what's
making these language sounds.


1350
01:19:41.545 --> 01:19:43.616
That's right. We don't know.

1351
01:19:50.796 --> 01:19:55.490
One time I heard a sound like
a huge tuning fork


1352
01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:58.942
above us and couldn't
find the source of it.


1353
01:19:58.976 --> 01:20:01.358
It was just a big sound
like that.


1354
01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:06.121
Sometimes you hear
a sound out here


1355
01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:09.815
and one time we thought our
camp was being torn
apart by something.


1356
01:20:09.849 --> 01:20:11.230
We thought the barrels

1357
01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:14.509
that we packed in was being
torn up and tossed around.


1358
01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:17.201
When we came out when all the
commotion and sound had stopped,


1359
01:20:17.236 --> 01:20:19.479
nothing changed.

1360
01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.516
Now, how do you explain that,
you know?


1361
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:24.450
One time, when I was in there,
I thought I heard
a car door slam.


1362
01:20:24.484 --> 01:20:26.417
Now, we're
eight miles into wilderness.


1363
01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:30.283
So, aside from the sounds,

1364
01:20:30.318 --> 01:20:32.872
you also saw some things
in the sky and the air?


1365
01:20:32.907 --> 01:20:35.392
MOREHEAD: Yeah, lights.

1366
01:20:36.013 --> 01:20:38.291
You know, orbs.

1367
01:20:38.326 --> 01:20:41.363
All the guys have reported orbs
when I wasn't here.


1368
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:46.196
Me and my friend Bill saw one
night was a big blue ball


1369
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:47.818
coming down from up here.

1370
01:20:47.853 --> 01:20:49.855
Slowly moving,
definitely controlled.


1371
01:20:49.889 --> 01:20:52.340
It had some type
of intelligence around it.


1372
01:20:52.374 --> 01:20:54.135
You know, if you were
just looking up there,


1373
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:56.033
you would think it was the moon.

1374
01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:57.759
But it was blue.

1375
01:20:57.793 --> 01:21:01.176
It was moving down. We lost it
behind the trees and it went
over there.


1376
01:21:01.211 --> 01:21:02.488
I don't know
what to think of it.


1377
01:21:02.522 --> 01:21:04.870
You don't know what to think of
any of this stuff.


1378
01:21:08.425 --> 01:21:09.564
We were in a tent

1379
01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:13.050
and it almost wasn't this dark.

1380
01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.328
But this thing,
whatever it was


1381
01:21:15.363 --> 01:21:17.986
just comes and starts
moving up behind us.


1382
01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:21.610
An elongated light,
probably about three-foot long,


1383
01:21:21.645 --> 01:21:23.750
probably about that big around

1384
01:21:23.785 --> 01:21:27.685
and just a rod of light.

1385
01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.447
I tell people
when I talk about it


1386
01:21:30.481 --> 01:21:33.657
that it's like
a Star Warssaber.


1387
01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:39.249
Like, glowing, but not bright
glowing. Just glowing.


1388
01:21:39.283 --> 01:21:42.045
And it just moved slowly
through the trees.


1389
01:21:42.079 --> 01:21:43.598
Definitely controlled.

1390
01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.601
And dissipated over here.

1391
01:21:50.743 --> 01:21:52.400
DAVID: Is it embarrassing
to talk about?


1392
01:21:52.848 --> 01:21:54.057
No, I don't care.

1393
01:21:55.265 --> 01:21:56.991
Now nothing bothers me.

1394
01:21:58.785 --> 01:22:00.615
DAVID: What makes you
keep coming back?


1395
01:22:03.411 --> 01:22:04.930
The mystery that's still here.

1396
01:22:04.964 --> 01:22:07.415
There's still a mystery
that needs to be solved


1397
01:22:07.449 --> 01:22:09.796
or understood.

1398
01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:14.905
And I'm here now
because you're here.


1399
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.943
I've been asked multiple times
to be brought up here


1400
01:22:17.977 --> 01:22:19.116
by different people,

1401
01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:21.256
and I've turned them down

1402
01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:23.051
basically because
I don't want this area,


1403
01:22:23.086 --> 01:22:24.259
such pristine areas

1404
01:22:24.294 --> 01:22:26.503
to be exposed
to a bunch of researchers


1405
01:22:26.537 --> 01:22:29.609
just come up here
and inundating the area.


1406
01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:33.441
And I'm also told that
the hunters that still come up

1407
01:22:33.475 --> 01:22:36.099
and their offspring
could still hunt the area.


1408
01:22:36.133 --> 01:22:39.447
You know, they'll all kind of
keep it very private


1409
01:22:39.481 --> 01:22:41.104
as much as possible.

1410
01:22:41.138 --> 01:22:45.556
Our shelter, although, has been
dismantled now, years ago.


1411
01:22:46.316 --> 01:22:47.903
It's still a place to come to.

1412
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:07.509
Nothing surprises me.
Nothing up here.


1413
01:23:07.544 --> 01:23:10.271
Why this is such
a strange place
I have no idea,


1414
01:23:10.305 --> 01:23:14.723
but it is
a very interesting area.


1415
01:23:25.389 --> 01:23:29.635
DAVID: We spent seven days
with Ron and Scott
at the Sierra camp.


1416
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:32.534
Now, although we didn't
experience anything
paranormal,


1417
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:35.882
this area holds many secrets.

1418
01:23:35.917 --> 01:23:37.091
That we know for sure.

1419
01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:47.756
The last case
I want to investigate


1420
01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:50.069
is even a little deeper
down the rabbit hole.


1421
01:23:52.382 --> 01:23:53.728
It's not about
a missing hunter,


1422
01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.661
but instead, about
a strange experience


1423
01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:58.181
one hunter faced in Lima, Ohio.

1424
01:23:58.215 --> 01:24:01.563
It's important to know that
this isn't a connection
to the missing.


1425
01:24:01.598 --> 01:24:05.153
It's simply an odd event
that's worth looking into.


1426
01:24:05.188 --> 01:24:09.640
And it's associated with
one of the smartest people
I've ever met.


1427
01:24:12.402 --> 01:24:13.886
There's a difference, I guess,

1428
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.544
between being freaked out
by things that you imagine


1429
01:24:16.578 --> 01:24:19.064
and being freaked out by things
that you actually see.


1430
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:24.931
JAN: This, I have to say,
was the most...


1431
01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:27.727
terrifying experience, but yeah,

1432
01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.764
I don't know why I didn't react
to it and that bothers me.


1433
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:46.091
JAN: Hunting in Ohio
is awesome.


1434
01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:49.542
We have some great, big
trophy deer in Ohio


1435
01:24:49.577 --> 01:24:50.750
and we happen to have

1436
01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:53.236
some of the biggest right
here on our own property.

1437
01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.778
It was the most
beautiful night to deer hunt.

1438
01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:20.125
It was the second day
of season.


1439
01:25:20.159 --> 01:25:23.266
I wanted to get into
the woods to hunt.


1440
01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.784
I was very excited about it.

1441
01:25:29.513 --> 01:25:32.689
There was band,
over at the high school.


1442
01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:37.072
By the time I got to my deer
stand, I could hear 'em.


1443
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.974
I was all settled in.

1444
01:25:42.008 --> 01:25:43.631
Didn't see nothing coming
down the pass.


1445
01:25:43.665 --> 01:25:46.668
Trails of birds,
crickets, everything was
normal wood sounds.


1446
01:25:48.532 --> 01:25:49.947
When you're hunting,

1447
01:25:49.982 --> 01:25:52.467
you have two
of your keenest senses.


1448
01:25:52.502 --> 01:25:54.159
It's your hearing
and your eyesight.


1449
01:25:58.232 --> 01:26:01.856
All of a sudden, the woods
went to this dead quiet.


1450
01:26:05.031 --> 01:26:07.551
If I had dropped a pin,
I know that deer would stand.


1451
01:26:09.691 --> 01:26:10.865
They had cut off.

1452
01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.833
No birds, no crickets,
no nothing.


1453
01:26:15.318 --> 01:26:16.629
With the sun still up,

1454
01:26:16.664 --> 01:26:18.528
we were not calling for
bad weather that night.


1455
01:26:18.562 --> 01:26:19.943
It was a great night to hunt.

1456
01:26:22.532 --> 01:26:25.293
All of a sudden,
I thought I had
a mote in my eye.


1457
01:26:25.328 --> 01:26:27.709
I even took my finger
and rubbed my eye, like,


1458
01:26:27.744 --> 01:26:29.332
when you get that fogginess
over your eye,


1459
01:26:29.366 --> 01:26:30.850
like, it's just...

1460
01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:32.507
I look and I'm thinking,

1461
01:26:32.542 --> 01:26:34.578
"What is this thing
in the trees?"


1462
01:26:36.097 --> 01:26:39.549
It looked like a large piece
of Saran Wrap.


1463
01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:40.929
It's the only way
I can describe it.


1464
01:26:40.964 --> 01:26:42.345
But this thing was very wide.

1465
01:26:42.379 --> 01:26:46.349
'Cause I'm up 14 foot
and it hung quite a ways down


1466
01:26:46.383 --> 01:26:47.798
and I'm thinking...

1467
01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:49.593
"What is this thing?"

1468
01:26:50.698 --> 01:26:52.872
It didn't really scare me
at that time,


1469
01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.943
until it moved and formed

1470
01:26:54.978 --> 01:26:57.705
the arm that reached over
to the other tree.


1471
01:26:57.739 --> 01:27:00.535
It reached over
about 12 to 14 foot.


1472
01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:04.229
And then, it all, like
a blob, sucked into it.

1473
01:27:04.263 --> 01:27:05.920
And it went to
a whole other tree.


1474
01:27:07.301 --> 01:27:09.268
I had this very important
feeling, like,


1475
01:27:09.303 --> 01:27:11.270
something ain't right here.

1476
01:27:12.789 --> 01:27:14.722
Normally at that time, I would
have probably got down


1477
01:27:14.756 --> 01:27:16.413
and stopped hunting,

1478
01:27:16.448 --> 01:27:17.794
but for some reason, I didn't.

1479
01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.969
DAVID: So, as you're sitting
in your blind,


1480
01:27:21.004 --> 01:27:22.730
and you're looking across,

1481
01:27:22.764 --> 01:27:25.733
where did the blob come from?

1482
01:27:25.767 --> 01:27:29.702
I have no idea.
It just appeared
in the one tree.


1483
01:27:29.737 --> 01:27:31.773
As it was moving
through the woods,


1484
01:27:31.808 --> 01:27:33.982
it went from tree
to tree to tree


1485
01:27:34.017 --> 01:27:35.984
and then it just disappeared.

1486
01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.642
It didn't continue on.

1487
01:27:38.677 --> 01:27:40.265
So, where it went I don't know,

1488
01:27:40.299 --> 01:27:43.164
but it just... Right before my
eyes, just vanished.


1489
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.445
And I don't remember
taking the picture,


1490
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.587
but being married to
who I'm married to,
Dr. Bruce Maccabee,


1491
01:27:52.622 --> 01:27:56.108
he always said, "If you see
anything weird, get a picture."


1492
01:27:59.629 --> 01:28:05.428
I don't recall actually when
either that the sounds had returned.

1493
01:28:05.462 --> 01:28:07.844
It's just like I don't remember.

1494
01:28:10.467 --> 01:28:11.917
That's not me to this day.

1495
01:28:11.951 --> 01:28:13.746
Normally, I would probably
crawl down,


1496
01:28:13.781 --> 01:28:15.438
come around the house and say,

1497
01:28:15.472 --> 01:28:17.336
"You ain't going to believe
what's back there
in the woods."


1498
01:28:17.371 --> 01:28:19.890
DAVID: How much longer
do you think
you stayed in the stand?


1499
01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:24.999
About half hour till sundown.
It was time to come out.


1500
01:28:29.659 --> 01:28:31.454
The strange part about this is,

1501
01:28:31.488 --> 01:28:32.869
Jan goes off to hunt,

1502
01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:36.631
we have guests show up,
we're having dinner.


1503
01:28:36.666 --> 01:28:38.012
She comes back from the hunt

1504
01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:40.325
and says nothing about what
happened. It was strange.


1505
01:28:41.705 --> 01:28:44.121
The guests are
about ready to leave.


1506
01:28:44.156 --> 01:28:47.159
Later on, Matthew sends me
an e-mail.


1507
01:28:47.193 --> 01:28:49.161
BRUCE: There was sighting
by a number of students


1508
01:28:49.195 --> 01:28:51.819
and faculty in the high school
band practice,


1509
01:28:51.853 --> 01:28:53.338
just before dark.

1510
01:28:53.924 --> 01:28:55.340
I'm like, "Holy crap.

1511
01:28:55.374 --> 01:28:57.928
Maybe it has something to do
with what I saw in the woods."


1512
01:28:58.653 --> 01:28:59.861
And Bruce goes, "What?"

1513
01:29:00.241 --> 01:29:01.656
And I said,

1514
01:29:01.691 --> 01:29:05.557
"I forgot to tell you what
happened in those woods
to me tonight."


1515
01:29:05.591 --> 01:29:07.628
And I'm reading
this from Matthew


1516
01:29:07.662 --> 01:29:10.009
and then I start
getting goosebumps.


1517
01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.839
He said
this light appeared above


1518
01:29:11.873 --> 01:29:15.049
like big stadium lights
in the football field.


1519
01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.809
Had Matthew
not sent that e-mail,


1520
01:29:16.844 --> 01:29:20.261
I'm not sure if I would have
remembered even that night to
say anything.


1521
01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:24.023
DAVID: How many kids
were on the field?


1522
01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:26.405
MATTHEW: At least 30.
Thirty to forty
I would say.


1523
01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.855
DAVID: And was that
the high school band?


1524
01:29:27.889 --> 01:29:29.581
MATTHEW: Yes.

1525
01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:31.859
DAVID: And so, this was
just before you guys went
back to school?


1526
01:29:31.893 --> 01:29:33.999
MATTHEW: Yes, band camp.

1527
01:29:34.033 --> 01:29:35.828
-MATTHEW: Late August.
-DAVID: Late August?


1528
01:29:35.863 --> 01:29:38.037
So, what time at night
do you think that was?


1529
01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:40.212
Between six and seven.

1530
01:29:40.246 --> 01:29:43.008
We were rehearsing
normally out here


1531
01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:45.010
about six or seven o'clock,

1532
01:29:45.044 --> 01:29:47.288
doing our normal routine.

1533
01:29:47.322 --> 01:29:49.670
When, all of a sudden, there was
this bright light in the sky


1534
01:29:49.704 --> 01:29:51.396
that just came out of nowhere.

1535
01:29:53.052 --> 01:29:55.400
And we all just kind of
stopped and looked at it as one.

1536
01:29:56.539 --> 01:29:58.126
DAVID: Where was the light?

1537
01:29:58.161 --> 01:30:01.613
So, the light was anywhere...

1538
01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:03.062
It was above
the treeline for sure,


1539
01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:05.927
just kind of hovering
in the skyline.


1540
01:30:06.928 --> 01:30:08.792
Close enough for it
to catch your attention.


1541
01:30:10.415 --> 01:30:11.795
Like, it shouldn't have been
there, I guess.


1542
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:13.452
If it was some man made thing,

1543
01:30:13.487 --> 01:30:14.936
it was too low to be there.

1544
01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:19.251
Okay, what was the weather
like that night?


1545
01:30:19.285 --> 01:30:20.735
Clear and hot.

1546
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:22.150
Typical August Ohio weather.

1547
01:30:22.185 --> 01:30:24.532
DAVID: Okay,
what color was it?


1548
01:30:24.567 --> 01:30:25.809
MATTHEW: Candle orange.

1549
01:30:25.844 --> 01:30:27.052
As far as I can tell,

1550
01:30:27.086 --> 01:30:28.916
the thing had
no definable edges to it.


1551
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:30.089
There were no,
like, dimensions.


1552
01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:32.747
It was just kind of waxing
and waning


1553
01:30:32.782 --> 01:30:34.473
till it zapped out.

1554
01:30:34.508 --> 01:30:36.717
You know, our band director,
he never stops for anything.


1555
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:39.478
He stopped and turned around
and looked at this and goes,


1556
01:30:39.513 --> 01:30:41.273
"What the hell was that?"

1557
01:30:41.307 --> 01:30:44.276
Before I had time to even
think of what I was
seeing, it was gone.


1558
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:46.278
And then it was just kind of
an imprint in your mind,


1559
01:30:46.312 --> 01:30:47.969
like I've seen
something strange.


1560
01:30:51.456 --> 01:30:55.494
DAVID: So, in your gut,
are the two issues related?


1561
01:30:55.529 --> 01:30:58.117
I often wonder now.

1562
01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.292
All I can say is it happened
within the same time frame


1563
01:31:00.326 --> 01:31:03.122
basically as
my experience here.


1564
01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:06.056
About half a mile over there,
as the crow would fly.


1565
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:09.508
BRUCE: This is a Blackberry.

1566
01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:13.270
On the back it has the lens.

1567
01:31:13.305 --> 01:31:14.617
It's not like the modern ones.

1568
01:31:14.651 --> 01:31:18.310
It has a camera on the front
and a camera at the back.


1569
01:31:18.344 --> 01:31:20.208
Though I'd be taking
your picture right now,


1570
01:31:20.243 --> 01:31:22.003
but I would not be
taking my picture.


1571
01:31:22.866 --> 01:31:24.627
Something happened
to the camera.


1572
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:26.318
I don't know what.

1573
01:31:26.352 --> 01:31:29.494
But there's hard evidence
of some weird thing
that happened.


1574
01:31:29.528 --> 01:31:32.704
She took a couple of pictures
of herself before the event,


1575
01:31:32.738 --> 01:31:37.467
which provided a fixed point
of investigation,
you might say.


1576
01:31:37.502 --> 01:31:39.676
And she took
another picture afterwards.


1577
01:31:39.711 --> 01:31:42.852
So you have the camera phone
doing its normal thing


1578
01:31:42.886 --> 01:31:44.336
before and after,

1579
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:47.650
but right in the middle,
with this one photo,


1580
01:31:47.684 --> 01:31:50.204
something bizarre happened.

1581
01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:54.139
The picture she took, the resolution somehow changed

1582
01:31:54.173 --> 01:31:55.520
for that one picture.

1583
01:31:58.039 --> 01:32:01.940
You could manually change the
cellphone 1600x1200,


1584
01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:05.530
1024x760,
or something like that.


1585
01:32:05.564 --> 01:32:07.393
And 640X480.

1586
01:32:07.428 --> 01:32:11.018
But it got changed
to 500X400 or something.


1587
01:32:11.052 --> 01:32:13.020
Numbers that don't exist.

1588
01:32:13.054 --> 01:32:15.850
I don't know how to
make it do that resolution.


1589
01:32:15.885 --> 01:32:18.750
You have to get it out
and re-wire it somehow,


1590
01:32:18.784 --> 01:32:20.234
or it changed the software.

1591
01:32:20.959 --> 01:32:22.374
But even changing the software

1592
01:32:22.408 --> 01:32:26.378
doesn't change the pixels
along the edge of the sensor.


1593
01:32:26.412 --> 01:32:29.415
I don't know how to explain
this film imagery stuff.


1594
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:33.903
I can't imagine what this...
what it looks like well focused.


1595
01:32:33.937 --> 01:32:35.283
I don't know what that is.

1596
01:32:37.078 --> 01:32:39.115
DAVID: I've had people
write to me and say


1597
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:43.395
"What that is is that Jan took
a picture of her own hair."


1598
01:32:43.429 --> 01:32:46.605
My hair was back. Through the
back of the ball cap.


1599
01:32:47.882 --> 01:32:50.402
Where it...
It was tied back.


1600
01:32:50.436 --> 01:32:52.956
DAVID: So, there was
no part of you that
could have been in that?


1601
01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:54.544
JAN: No way. No way.

1602
01:32:54.579 --> 01:32:56.581
It'll be possible for us
to take a picture,


1603
01:32:57.651 --> 01:33:00.274
of her hair,
if she put her hand
back there.


1604
01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:02.587
But that wouldn't
change the resolution


1605
01:33:02.621 --> 01:33:05.935
of the camera
or the byte size
of the picture.


1606
01:33:05.969 --> 01:33:07.212
DAVID: So, Jan, let me ask you,

1607
01:33:07.246 --> 01:33:09.973
since that has happened,
has it changed your life?


1608
01:33:11.009 --> 01:33:12.597
Yeah, I've never been
back in that wood.


1609
01:33:12.631 --> 01:33:16.462
I actually ended up buying
a Redneck deer blind.


1610
01:33:16.497 --> 01:33:18.775
I mean, I want something
surrounding me.


1611
01:33:21.157 --> 01:33:23.331
BRUCE: Imagine if you
saw something in the woods


1612
01:33:23.366 --> 01:33:26.162
some strange thing like that
like the ...


1613
01:33:26.196 --> 01:33:28.613
you'd probably be wary
of going back there, too.


1614
01:33:47.459 --> 01:33:49.634
DAVID: When looking
at these cases
individually,


1615
01:33:50.289 --> 01:33:52.637
Aaron Hedges, Tom Messick,

1616
01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.984
Mel Nadel,

1617
01:33:55.018 --> 01:33:58.815
it's easy to pass them off
as isolated
strange occurrences.


1618
01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:00.299
Anomalies.

1619
01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.475
But when you look from
an informed perspective,


1620
01:34:03.509 --> 01:34:07.652
and you see hundreds of
victims falling in to
same profile points


1621
01:34:07.686 --> 01:34:11.656
scattered throughout
our national forests
and national parks,


1622
01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.348
you have to stop and
question the reality of it.

1623
01:34:16.005 --> 01:34:18.973
Is it possible for
an 82-year-old man


1624
01:34:19.008 --> 01:34:22.183
with heart, eye
and hearing issues


1625
01:34:22.218 --> 01:34:24.703
to simply vanish while
sitting alone in the woods?


1626
01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:31.537
Can a man
with severe hypothermia
hike six miles through


1627
01:34:31.572 --> 01:34:34.264
a foot and a half to two feet
of snow with no shoes?


1628
01:34:35.610 --> 01:34:36.991
In many of the cases,

1629
01:34:37.026 --> 01:34:40.408
rifles, pistols and archery
equipment are never found.


1630
01:34:40.443 --> 01:34:44.205
These items don't blow away
and animals don't drag
them off.


1631
01:34:45.724 --> 01:34:49.521
Sometimes, their remains are
found miles and miles
off track,


1632
01:34:49.555 --> 01:34:53.042
where the victim had no
intention of ever going.


1633
01:34:53.076 --> 01:34:57.184
Often, they're found in an
area that's been searched
dozens of times.


1634
01:34:57.218 --> 01:35:00.566
It's like they've been placed
there after the searchers
have left.


1635
01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:05.744
To this point,

1636
01:35:05.779 --> 01:35:08.229
we've investigated close
to 1200 cases


1637
01:35:08.264 --> 01:35:10.749
that fit theMissing

1638
01:35:12.889 --> 01:35:14.615
They're not all hunters.

1639
01:35:14.649 --> 01:35:19.068
Some are children, some are
people vacationing
in national parks,


1640
01:35:19.102 --> 01:35:22.727
some are just out taking
a walk in nature.


1641
01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:27.214
Each are beyond
the scope of normal
scientific understanding.
