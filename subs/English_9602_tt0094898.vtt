1
00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.380
Good morning, your Highness.

2
00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:46.092
Good morning, your Highness.

3
00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:49.804
Good morning, your Highness.

4
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.308
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.


5
00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.935
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

6
00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:41.064
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?


7
00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.777
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!


8
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.258
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.


9
00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:07.025
His Highness
must be very excited today.


10
00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:11.405
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.


11
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.408
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?


12
00:06:58.993 --> 00:07:02.078
He certainly is quiet this morning.

13
00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:05.208
He looks sad.

14
00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:09.879
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.


15
00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:17.596
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.


16
00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:24.144
I'm also a concerned dad.

17
00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:28.064
Well, Father... 
Just a moment.

18
00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:33.736
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.


19
00:07:35.947 --> 00:07:38.615
Wait right there, Akeem.

20
00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:41.744
Rose bearers!

21
00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:50.963
Akeem. Come sit.

22
00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.310
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?


23
00:08:07.146 --> 00:08:10.274
Jaffe, it has been a year.

24
00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.485
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.


25
00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:19.533
- Like what?
- The rose petals.


26
00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:22.743
You're the son of a king, why shouldn't
you walk on the petals of roses?


27
00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:27.666
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.


28
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.294
Then it is settled. 
From this day forth,

29
00:08:31.587 --> 00:08:34.715
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.


30
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.261
It is not just that, it is everything.

31
00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:43.390
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...


32
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.851
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

33
00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:50.980
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.


34
00:08:52.857 --> 00:08:55.985
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?


35
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.867
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.


36
00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:06.913
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.


37
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.336
But what if I don't love her?

38
00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:16.465
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.


39
00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:19.549
When I met your father, 
I was terrified.

40
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.678
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

41
00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:25.849
I was so nervous, 
I became nauseous.

42
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.478
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.


43
00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:33.731
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.


44
00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:38.402
I understand, but when I marry,

45
00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:41.740
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.


46
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.118
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.


47
00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:50.582
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.


48
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.378
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.


49
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.219
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.


50
00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.848
And, Semmi, what is it now?

51
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:12.104
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.


52
00:10:13.063 --> 00:10:16.191
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.


53
00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:22.447
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?


54
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.160
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.


55
00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.914
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

56
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.086
Have a good day, my son.

57
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.300
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?


58
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.348
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.


59
00:11:10.913 --> 00:11:14.041
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,


60
00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:17.376
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?


61
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.048
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.


62
00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:32.600
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.


63
00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:36.605
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.


64
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:56.707
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool?


65
00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.753
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.


66
00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:08.845
It's also tradition
that times must change.


67
00:12:27.823 --> 00:12:30.951
Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt!
Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!


68
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.289
- These really are delicious.
- Yes, thank you.


69
00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:30.344
Your Majesty.

70
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:33.346
I am Colonel Issy.

71
00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:36.475
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.


72
00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:45.566
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.


73
00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:50.280
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!


74
00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:00.207
Greetings, great Prince.
Presenting Miss Imani Issi.


75
00:16:10.712 --> 00:16:13.841
She's your Queen-to-be

76
00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:20.472
A Queen-to-be forever

77
00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:25.101
A Queen who'll do whatever

78
00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.855
His Highness desires

79
00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:33.777
She's your Queen-to-be

80
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.159
A vision of perfection

81
00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:44.745
An object of affection

82
00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:48.166
To quench your royal fire

83
00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:53.004
Completely free from infection

84
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:59.343
To be used at your discretion

85
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.889
Waiting only for your direction

86
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.688
Your Queen-to-be

87
00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:35.963
May I talk to you alone
for a moment, please?


88
00:17:39.884 --> 00:17:43.012
Excuse us for a moment.

89
00:18:14.335 --> 00:18:17.463
- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?


90
00:18:19.006 --> 00:18:20.925
You're fine. Beautiful.

91
00:18:20.926 --> 00:18:24.054
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.


92
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.933
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.


93
00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.604
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?


94
00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.443
Whatever you like.

95
00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:41.613
- What kind of music do you like?
- Whatever kind of music you like.


96
00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:47.578
I know what I like, and you know what
I like, 'cause you were trained to know,


97
00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:51.957
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?


98
00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:55.626
Good! What is your favourite food?

99
00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:58.755
Whatever food you like.

100
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.968
This is impossible.
I command you not to obey me.


101
00:19:04.219 --> 00:19:07.347
No.

102
00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:10.933
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?


103
00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:13.936
Yes, your Highness.

104
00:19:13.937 --> 00:19:17.065
- Anything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.


105
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:21.319
Bark like a dog.

106
00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:26.742
A big dog.

107
00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:31.830
Hop on one leg.

108
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.167
Make a noise like an orang-utan.

109
00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:42.841
I see the two
of you are getting along.

110
00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:49.180
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

111
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.568
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.


112
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:07.240
Father...

113
00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:12.702
About this wedding...

114
00:20:12.703 --> 00:20:15.164
The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

115
00:20:15.165 --> 00:20:18.293
Let them wait! 
I'm talking to my son.

116
00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:24.715
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

117
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.149
Hello, Babar.

118
00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:48.073
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,


119
00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:53.911
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.


120
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:58.249
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?


121
00:20:59.834 --> 00:21:02.962
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

122
00:21:03.172 --> 00:21:06.257
I know we never
had a talk about this,

123
00:21:06.258 --> 00:21:09.386
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.


124
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.808
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.


125
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.938
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.


126
00:21:22.064 --> 00:21:25.193
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...


127
00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:29.280
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.


128
00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:33.242
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.


129
00:21:35.662 --> 00:21:38.791
- But, Father...
- It is settled.


130
00:21:53.764 --> 00:21:56.892
May I have your attention, please?

131
00:21:58.143 --> 00:22:01.271
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.


132
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.608
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.


133
00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:12.907
Prepare the royal baggage!

134
00:22:15.743 --> 00:22:18.871
This trip is an excellent idea.

135
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.668
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.


136
00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:29.675
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?


137
00:22:31.843 --> 00:22:34.971
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.


138
00:22:35.513 --> 00:22:38.641
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.


139
00:22:42.103 --> 00:22:45.146
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.


140
00:22:45.147 --> 00:22:48.276
Where shall we go?
Los Angeles or New York?


141
00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:52.823
We'll let fate decide.

142
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.828
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Angeles.

143
00:23:00.497 --> 00:23:03.541
We go to New York.

144
00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:06.670
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?


145
00:23:08.129 --> 00:23:11.257
A woman suitable for a king.

146
00:23:14.427 --> 00:23:17.555
Queens!

147
00:23:32.153 --> 00:23:35.281
Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please pick up
a white courtesy telephone.


148
00:23:42.164 --> 00:23:45.292
No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.


149
00:23:46.877 --> 00:23:50.005
I will not say a word.

150
00:24:03.477 --> 00:24:06.311
Halt!

151
00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:09.440
You dumb fuck!

152
00:24:13.569 --> 00:24:16.697
Take us to Queens at once.

153
00:24:19.826 --> 00:24:22.954
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.


154
00:24:25.248 --> 00:24:27.500
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

155
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:30.629
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.


156
00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:34.715
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.


157
00:24:35.843 --> 00:24:38.928
Whatever you say, pal.

158
00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:42.057
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.


159
00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:48.187
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.


160
00:24:52.776 --> 00:24:55.904
What does "dumb fuck" mean?

161
00:25:25.474 --> 00:25:28.603
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.


162
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.768
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

163
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.858
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.


164
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.698
You must be
out of your goddamn mind!


165
00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:27.245
Listen. Real Americans.

166
00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:30.331
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.


167
00:26:30.332 --> 00:26:33.460
- What about Joe Louis?
- "The Brown Bomber".


168
00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:37.047
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.


169
00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:40.508
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.


170
00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:43.426
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.


171
00:26:43.427 --> 00:26:45.011
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

172
00:26:45.012 --> 00:26:48.140
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.


173
00:26:50.017 --> 00:26:52.310
Wait a second. 
Wait a second.

174
00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:55.439
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.


175
00:26:57.775 --> 00:27:00.903
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,


176
00:27:01.238 --> 00:27:04.366
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.


177
00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:10.456
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.


178
00:27:11.206 --> 00:27:14.334
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.


179
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.879
He'll always be Clay to me. I don't
care what he changes his name to.


180
00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:23.427
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.


181
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.889
You should change the name from
"My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".


182
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.489
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.


183
00:27:44.781 --> 00:27:47.910
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?


184
00:27:50.495 --> 00:27:53.623
Come on in, gentlemen.

185
00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:58.461
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

186
00:28:02.257 --> 00:28:05.385
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.


187
00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:11.183
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.


188
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:15.520
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?


189
00:28:16.104 --> 00:28:19.233
We require a room that is very poor.

190
00:28:23.778 --> 00:28:26.655
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.


191
00:28:26.656 --> 00:28:29.784
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.


192
00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:35.374
Every month, the same damn thing...

193
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:55.893
Here we are.

194
00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:59.272
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.


195
00:29:03.693 --> 00:29:06.821
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.


196
00:29:10.284 --> 00:29:13.412
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.


197
00:29:14.579 --> 00:29:17.707
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.


198
00:29:19.418 --> 00:29:22.546
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.


199
00:29:33.139 --> 00:29:36.267
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.


200
00:29:42.565 --> 00:29:44.942
We will take the room.

201
00:29:44.943 --> 00:29:48.071
Yes.

202
00:30:02.126 --> 00:30:05.254
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

203
00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:08.799
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.


204
00:30:11.427 --> 00:30:14.555
- Good morning, my neighbours!
- Fuck you!


205
00:30:14.973 --> 00:30:18.101
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

206
00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.208
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.


207
00:30:48.798 --> 00:30:50.840
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?


208
00:30:50.842 --> 00:30:53.970
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.


209
00:30:56.264 --> 00:30:59.392
Thief! Stop thief! 
Come back, thief!

210
00:30:59.976 --> 00:31:03.104
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.


211
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.358
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.


212
00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:10.779
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.


213
00:31:17.744 --> 00:31:20.873
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.


214
00:31:22.874 --> 00:31:26.002
You know, you can be all the things
you've always wanted to be.


215
00:31:29.506 --> 00:31:32.634
Beautiful, sexy...

216
00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:36.220
One, two, three...

217
00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.078
Soul Glo.

218
00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:03.999
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.


219
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.378
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.


220
00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:10.421
I'll be with you in a minute.

221
00:32:10.422 --> 00:32:13.550
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.


222
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.348
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!


223
00:32:20.307 --> 00:32:23.435
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.


224
00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:27.813
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.


225
00:32:29.817 --> 00:32:32.945
That's their one, that's their one.
"Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"


226
00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:36.447
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,


227
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.618
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!


228
00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:42.702
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

229
00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:45.832
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!


230
00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:49.836
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.


231
00:32:49.837 --> 00:32:52.965
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.


232
00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:57.134
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

233
00:32:57.136 --> 00:32:59.512
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

234
00:32:59.513 --> 00:33:02.641
I said, "You hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?"


235
00:33:02.974 --> 00:33:06.102
Frank said,
"Joe Louis is 137 years old".


236
00:33:07.937 --> 00:33:11.065
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.


237
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.279
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?


238
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:27.915
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?


239
00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:31.044
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.


240
00:33:32.045 --> 00:33:34.714
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?


241
00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:37.843
None, only juices and berries.

242
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.138
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?


243
00:33:44.182 --> 00:33:47.310
Just make it nice and neat.

244
00:33:55.569 --> 00:33:58.697
That'll be 8 dollars.

245
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.499
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?


246
00:34:13.878 --> 00:34:17.006
It is time to find your queen.

247
00:34:47.245 --> 00:34:50.289
I've got a secret.

248
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.418
I worship the devil.

249
00:34:57.506 --> 00:35:00.634
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.


250
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.098
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.


251
00:35:06.597 --> 00:35:09.725
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.


252
00:35:11.603 --> 00:35:14.731
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.


253
00:35:15.482 --> 00:35:18.610
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.


254
00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:23.281
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.


255
00:35:27.578 --> 00:35:30.706
I'm into the group thing.

256
00:35:32.832 --> 00:35:35.960
I was Joan of
Arc in my former life.

257
00:35:40.298 --> 00:35:42.799
My name is Peaches
And I'm the best


258
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.928
All the D.J.s want
to feel my breasts


259
00:35:50.766 --> 00:35:53.895
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,


260
00:35:54.563 --> 00:35:57.691
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.


261
00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:03.196
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural.


262
00:36:04.948 --> 00:36:08.076
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...


263
00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:26.593
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.


264
00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:29.722
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.


265
00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:37.021
And your friend, too.

266
00:36:40.107 --> 00:36:43.236
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?


267
00:36:45.863 --> 00:36:48.991
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

268
00:36:50.494 --> 00:36:53.622
- Mr Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?


269
00:36:56.332 --> 00:36:59.460
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.


270
00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:03.965
We've been to every bar in Queens.

271
00:37:03.966 --> 00:37:06.800
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.


272
00:37:06.801 --> 00:37:09.929
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.


273
00:37:12.557 --> 00:37:15.685
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.


274
00:37:15.978 --> 00:37:19.106
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.


275
00:37:26.738 --> 00:37:29.867
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.


276
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:37.957
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,


277
00:37:41.127 --> 00:37:44.255
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.


278
00:37:47.049 --> 00:37:49.343
There's a God somewhere.

279
00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:51.762
Turn around, ladies.

280
00:37:51.763 --> 00:37:54.892
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.


281
00:37:56.392 --> 00:37:59.270
Man cannot make it like this.

282
00:37:59.271 --> 00:38:02.399
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,


283
00:38:02.858 --> 00:38:05.986
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.


284
00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:11.700
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.


285
00:38:13.869 --> 00:38:15.870
Be patient, my friend.

286
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:18.999
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say "joy"!


287
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.834
- Joy!
- Joy.


288
00:38:22.835 --> 00:38:24.712
- Joy!
- Joy!


289
00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:27.841
- Can I get a "Amen"?
- Amen, brother!


290
00:38:30.052 --> 00:38:33.095
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

291
00:38:33.096 --> 00:38:34.639
Yes, Lord!

292
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.768
Only God can give that woman
that kind ofjoy.


293
00:38:40.102 --> 00:38:43.231
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!


294
00:38:44.315 --> 00:38:47.443
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!


295
00:38:50.155 --> 00:38:53.283
Can I get a "Amen"?

296
00:38:54.075 --> 00:38:57.203
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.


297
00:39:01.291 --> 00:39:04.419
Lord, Lord...

298
00:39:05.586 --> 00:39:08.714
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.


299
00:39:09.591 --> 00:39:12.719
There's a God somewhere.

300
00:39:13.637 --> 00:39:16.721
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.


301
00:39:16.722 --> 00:39:19.851
A young man, that you all know
as Joe the policeman


302
00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:24.064
from the "What's Going Down"
episode of "That's My Momma".


303
00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:28.109
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.


304
00:39:29.026 --> 00:39:32.154
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own


305
00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:36.367
Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

306
00:39:38.452 --> 00:39:41.581
- That boy's good.
- Good and terrible.


307
00:39:43.791 --> 00:39:45.792
And Reverend Brown.

308
00:39:45.793 --> 00:39:48.921
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.


309
00:39:50.174 --> 00:39:53.302
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.


310
00:39:57.097 --> 00:40:00.225
It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.


311
00:40:03.312 --> 00:40:06.440
Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.


312
00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:15.324
Sexual Chocolate.
They play so fine, don't you agree?


313
00:40:36.886 --> 00:40:40.014
- Some of the good stuff? Coming up.
- Do you want a Coke?


314
00:40:42.267 --> 00:40:45.395
- Enjoying the show?
- Enjoy, young man.


315
00:41:13.881 --> 00:41:17.009
Sexy Chocolate!

316
00:41:18.052 --> 00:41:21.180
Sexy Chocolate!

317
00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:27.937
- Goddamn, that boy can sing.
- You must be crazy.


318
00:41:38.322 --> 00:41:41.450
Put your hands together
for Mr Randy Watson.


319
00:41:41.785 --> 00:41:44.913
Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!


320
00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:49.084
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,


321
00:41:50.835 --> 00:41:53.963
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.


322
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.718
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.


323
00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.598
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.


324
00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:06.142
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl.


325
00:42:06.935 --> 00:42:10.063
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.


326
00:42:11.314 --> 00:42:14.442
At least give them the address.

327
00:42:17.987 --> 00:42:21.115
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.


328
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:29.999
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self-expression.


329
00:42:32.878 --> 00:42:35.922
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.


330
00:42:35.923 --> 00:42:39.051
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...


331
00:42:42.094 --> 00:42:45.055
The song makes a good point.

332
00:42:45.056 --> 00:42:47.766
The children are our future,

333
00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:50.895
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.


334
00:42:53.732 --> 00:42:56.860
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

335
00:42:58.028 --> 00:43:01.156
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.


336
00:43:05.535 --> 00:43:08.663
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,


337
00:43:09.205 --> 00:43:12.333
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

338
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.178
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.


339
00:43:24.638 --> 00:43:27.181
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.


340
00:43:27.182 --> 00:43:30.310
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.


341
00:43:44.908 --> 00:43:48.036
Thank you.

342
00:43:50.955 --> 00:43:54.083
- She is wonderful.
- Akeem...


343
00:43:55.252 --> 00:43:58.380
You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,


344
00:44:00.173 --> 00:44:03.301
8507, Queens Boulevard.

345
00:44:04.595 --> 00:44:07.723
8507, Queens Boulevard.

346
00:44:19.442 --> 00:44:22.570
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.


347
00:44:23.196 --> 00:44:26.324
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.


348
00:44:27.366 --> 00:44:30.495
And don't leave no streaks.

349
00:44:33.539 --> 00:44:36.667
What are you doing?

350
00:44:38.377 --> 00:44:41.506
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!


351
00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:48.847
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.


352
00:44:53.685 --> 00:44:56.814
See, they're "McDonald's".
I'm "McDowell's".


353
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:03.819
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.


354
00:45:08.407 --> 00:45:11.535
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.


355
00:45:11.536 --> 00:45:14.664
We both got two all-beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.


356
00:45:16.249 --> 00:45:19.377
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.


357
00:45:24.173 --> 00:45:27.301
I've got it.

358
00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:32.850
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.


359
00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:37.396
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.


360
00:45:38.688 --> 00:45:41.816
There you go.

361
00:45:54.663 --> 00:45:57.791
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.


362
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:02.170
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.


363
00:46:03.505 --> 00:46:06.633
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.


364
00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:41.126
- Hi!
- Hello.


365
00:46:44.213 --> 00:46:47.341
Hello.

366
00:46:47.424 --> 00:46:50.552
Hi...

367
00:46:51.011 --> 00:46:54.139
I am Akeem.

368
00:46:55.098 --> 00:46:58.227
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

369
00:46:58.434 --> 00:47:01.562
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal?


370
00:47:04.107 --> 00:47:07.236
No, it's totally empty.

371
00:47:08.486 --> 00:47:11.614
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.


372
00:47:15.035 --> 00:47:17.119
That's good to know.

373
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:20.249
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.


374
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.338
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.


375
00:47:27.088 --> 00:47:30.216
Maybe we will have a chance
to talk again on a professional level.


376
00:47:33.762 --> 00:47:36.890
Goodbye, Akeem.

377
00:48:34.114 --> 00:48:37.242
Darryl! You're looking sharp.

378
00:48:38.701 --> 00:48:41.829
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favourite.


379
00:48:43.123 --> 00:48:44.998
Straw.

380
00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:48.127
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.


381
00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:54.800
- How's everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.


382
00:48:55.259 --> 00:48:58.387
Our home weave products
are really taking off.


383
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.809
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.


384
00:49:04.185 --> 00:49:07.313
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!


385
00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:13.195
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!


386
00:49:13.946 --> 00:49:17.074
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?


387
00:49:22.121 --> 00:49:24.996
- Ready?
- Sure.


388
00:49:24.997 --> 00:49:27.624
I want to ask you something.

389
00:49:27.625 --> 00:49:30.753
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.


390
00:49:33.464 --> 00:49:36.592
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?


391
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.057
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!


392
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:46.562
You know me. Anything for the kids.

393
00:49:53.192 --> 00:49:56.320
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.


394
00:49:59.116 --> 00:50:02.244
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.


395
00:50:04.288 --> 00:50:07.416
Take care of this, will you?

396
00:50:19.886 --> 00:50:23.014
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.


397
00:50:27.728 --> 00:50:30.856
What can I do you for?

398
00:50:33.232 --> 00:50:36.360
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?


399
00:50:37.403 --> 00:50:39.780
I like your hair, it's natural.

400
00:50:39.781 --> 00:50:42.910
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.


401
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:47.039
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.


402
00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:53.044
- I met Dr Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.


403
00:50:54.463 --> 00:50:57.591
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.


404
00:50:57.674 --> 00:51:00.676
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.


405
00:51:00.677 --> 00:51:03.595
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.


406
00:51:03.596 --> 00:51:06.390
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.


407
00:51:06.391 --> 00:51:09.520
I said, "Dr King." He said,
"Oops, I thought it was someone else."


408
00:51:10.103 --> 00:51:13.147
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.


409
00:51:13.148 --> 00:51:15.775
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.


410
00:51:15.776 --> 00:51:17.818
Why do you worry about how you look?

411
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.948
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.


412
00:51:22.323 --> 00:51:25.451
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.


413
00:51:25.993 --> 00:51:29.121
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl?


414
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:34.461
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.


415
00:51:35.504 --> 00:51:37.546
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.


416
00:51:37.547 --> 00:51:40.675
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.


417
00:51:42.134 --> 00:51:45.263
Get in good with the father,
you home free.


418
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.808
- Home free.
- Like a bird.


419
00:51:59.153 --> 00:52:02.281
- Mr McDowell.
- What is it?


420
00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:06.117
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?


421
00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:12.541
- No, I didn't.
- It was most exhilarating.


422
00:52:12.624 --> 00:52:15.752
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.


423
00:52:15.794 --> 00:52:18.922
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".


424
00:52:21.008 --> 00:52:24.136
It was a ripping victory.

425
00:52:25.386 --> 00:52:28.514
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.


426
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.978
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.


427
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.608
Yes, sir.

428
00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:45.407
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.


429
00:52:52.206 --> 00:52:55.334
- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?


430
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.088
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.


431
00:53:01.422 --> 00:53:04.550
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?


432
00:53:33.788 --> 00:53:36.916
I'll get it.

433
00:53:43.882 --> 00:53:47.010
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.


434
00:53:47.052 --> 00:53:50.180
Would you sign here, please?

435
00:53:57.938 --> 00:54:01.066
- What is it?
- Something for you.


436
00:54:01.983 --> 00:54:05.111
Do you mind if I open it?

437
00:54:09.198 --> 00:54:12.326
- Do you think they're real?
- They couldn't be.


438
00:54:15.664 --> 00:54:18.792
"From an admirer. Not Darryl."

439
00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:22.253
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.


440
00:54:23.088 --> 00:54:25.506
I don't care
how much a man admires you.


441
00:54:25.507 --> 00:54:28.635
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.


442
00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:32.764
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.


443
00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:55.995
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?


444
00:54:57.038 --> 00:55:00.166
Semmi, look. There she is.

445
00:55:01.001 --> 00:55:03.669
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.


446
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.463
Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar
pair of earrings.


447
00:55:06.464 --> 00:55:09.592
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.


448
00:55:10.844 --> 00:55:12.886
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.


449
00:55:12.887 --> 00:55:16.015
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?


450
00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.938
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labour.


451
00:55:23.189 --> 00:55:26.317
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...


452
00:55:26.693 --> 00:55:29.822
"I'm badly in need of a manicure."

453
00:55:29.862 --> 00:55:32.990
Are you going to say something?

454
00:55:36.828 --> 00:55:39.956
- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?


455
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.878
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?


456
00:55:45.796 --> 00:55:48.924
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?


457
00:55:49.382 --> 00:55:52.425
I go to the University.

458
00:55:52.426 --> 00:55:55.555
Which one?

459
00:55:56.138 --> 00:55:59.267
The University of the United States.

460
00:56:00.685 --> 00:56:03.104
I've never heard of that.

461
00:56:03.105 --> 00:56:06.233
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.


462
00:56:06.859 --> 00:56:09.987
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?


463
00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:15.575
Yes.

464
00:56:15.576 --> 00:56:18.704
You can double-date
with me and Darryl.


465
00:56:45.021 --> 00:56:47.523
In his face! In his face!

466
00:56:47.524 --> 00:56:50.652
Yes! In the face!

467
00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.909
Why don't you take off yourjacket,
Akeem?


468
00:56:57.074 --> 00:57:00.203
"Put it in the
face," right? I like this.

469
00:57:01.621 --> 00:57:04.749
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.


470
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:15.677
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.


471
00:57:16.427 --> 00:57:19.555
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!


472
00:57:20.682 --> 00:57:23.811
I'm following the game quite well.

473
00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.898
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?


474
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:34.279
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.


475
00:57:34.738 --> 00:57:36.822
Yeah, right. Soccer.

476
00:57:36.824 --> 00:57:39.952
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.


477
00:57:42.954 --> 00:57:46.082
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.


478
00:57:48.084 --> 00:57:50.710
Yes! Yes!

479
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:53.840
What are you doing?
It's just the half-time?


480
00:57:55.676 --> 00:57:58.804
This is my favourite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?


481
00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:03.100
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

482
00:58:18.031 --> 00:58:21.160
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!


483
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:25.580
I cannot believe it.

484
00:58:27.832 --> 00:58:30.960
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.


485
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:35.089
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.


486
00:58:37.258 --> 00:58:40.386
This is the greatest day of my life.

487
00:58:41.345 --> 00:58:44.473
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.


488
00:58:48.979 --> 00:58:52.107
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?


489
00:59:05.037 --> 00:59:08.165
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.


490
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:19.718
For the rest of my life.

491
00:59:21.928 --> 00:59:25.056
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.


492
00:59:34.023 --> 00:59:37.151
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.


493
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:41.697
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.


494
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.829
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.


495
00:59:48.496 --> 00:59:51.624
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.


496
00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:56.504
I'll get you some... coffee.

497
00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.008
I'll be right back.

498
01:00:07.558 --> 01:00:10.686
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?


499
01:00:10.769 --> 01:00:12.395
Yes, I did.

500
01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:15.524
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.


501
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.318
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.


502
01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:26.616
You're an unusual guy.

503
01:00:26.617 --> 01:00:29.745
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.


504
01:00:29.955 --> 01:00:33.083
"He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk."


505
01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:37.379
"One cannot fly into flying."
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.


506
01:00:39.339 --> 01:00:42.468
That's what I mean. The guys
that work here don't quote Nietzsche.


507
01:00:48.307 --> 01:00:51.435
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

508
01:00:51.852 --> 01:00:54.980
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.


509
01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:59.233
Take the money out! All of it.

510
01:00:59.234 --> 01:01:02.362
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

511
01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:05.656
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!


512
01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:12.706
Anybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.


513
01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.918
What are you looking at, buddy?

514
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.048
Come on! Stop stalling.

515
01:01:24.091 --> 01:01:27.220
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

516
01:01:33.351 --> 01:01:36.479
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.


517
01:01:43.361 --> 01:01:45.530
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.


518
01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:48.659
Who is this asshole?

519
01:01:49.368 --> 01:01:52.496
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.


520
01:01:54.288 --> 01:01:57.166
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.


521
01:01:57.167 --> 01:02:00.295
Fuck you!

522
01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:07.594
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.


523
01:02:20.398 --> 01:02:23.526
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.


524
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.071
We've been hit by that guy five times,

525
01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:31.200
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.


526
01:02:34.787 --> 01:02:37.915
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.


527
01:02:42.086 --> 01:02:45.214
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.


528
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:50.179
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.


529
01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:55.098
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.


530
01:02:55.099 --> 01:02:58.227
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.


531
01:03:05.735 --> 01:03:08.863
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.


532
01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:15.287
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.


533
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.628
And look what I have today.

534
01:03:22.877 --> 01:03:26.005
I only wish Mrs McDowell
could have lived to see it.


535
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.468
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.


536
01:03:30.385 --> 01:03:33.514
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.


537
01:03:39.477 --> 01:03:42.605
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?


538
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:49.154
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.


539
01:03:58.246 --> 01:04:01.374
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.


540
01:04:03.252 --> 01:04:06.254
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

541
01:04:06.255 --> 01:04:09.383
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.


542
01:04:13.845 --> 01:04:16.973
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.


543
01:04:19.725 --> 01:04:22.854
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.


544
01:04:23.896 --> 01:04:27.024
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.


545
01:04:29.736 --> 01:04:32.865
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.


546
01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:36.950
Big Ed, my man!

547
01:04:36.951 --> 01:04:40.079
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.


548
01:04:41.998 --> 01:04:45.084
I would've helped you out, except...

549
01:04:45.085 --> 01:04:48.213
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?


550
01:04:48.337 --> 01:04:51.465
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.


551
01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:57.389
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.


552
01:04:58.098 --> 01:05:01.226
I'm all for that. 
Especially with women.

553
01:05:02.561 --> 01:05:05.562
They may not admit it...

554
01:05:05.563 --> 01:05:08.691
...but they all want
a man to take charge.


555
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:18.159
Tell them what to do.

556
01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:28.376
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...


557
01:05:28.377 --> 01:05:31.506
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.


558
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:36.219
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.


559
01:05:38.263 --> 01:05:41.391
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.


560
01:05:41.767 --> 01:05:44.895
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.


561
01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:51.359
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.


562
01:05:51.442 --> 01:05:54.570
We're about to make
a very special announcement.


563
01:05:59.742 --> 01:06:02.870
May I have
everyone's attention, please.


564
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:09.878
Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.


565
01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:24.643
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.


566
01:06:25.185 --> 01:06:28.313
Semmi, please...

567
01:06:29.273 --> 01:06:32.401
Champagne.

568
01:06:32.776 --> 01:06:35.903
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


569
01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:39.032
Okay, get going. 
Get out of here. Go on.

570
01:06:41.492 --> 01:06:44.620
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have
been going together for quite some time.


571
01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:50.586
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.


572
01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:58.010
And Lisa happily accepted.

573
01:07:05.474 --> 01:07:08.603
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.


574
01:07:09.897 --> 01:07:13.025
Amen! Praise the Lord.

575
01:07:13.691 --> 01:07:16.819
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.


576
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.281
To the bride and groom!

577
01:07:20.282 --> 01:07:23.410
To the bride and groom.

578
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:33.044
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.


579
01:07:34.296 --> 01:07:37.424
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.


580
01:07:37.466 --> 01:07:40.594
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.


581
01:07:42.386 --> 01:07:45.473
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.


582
01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:48.602
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!


583
01:07:49.852 --> 01:07:52.980
I want to talk to you, now!

584
01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:06.120
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.


585
01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:10.832
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!


586
01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:13.961
But baby, it's our engagement party.

587
01:08:25.346 --> 01:08:28.474
Thanks.

588
01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:37.609
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.


589
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:45.658
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

590
01:08:56.002 --> 01:08:59.130
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.


591
01:08:59.882 --> 01:09:03.010
I can be loose. See?

592
01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:07.181
Much better.

593
01:09:07.723 --> 01:09:10.851
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.


594
01:09:10.893 --> 01:09:14.021
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.


595
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:19.818
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,


596
01:09:20.443 --> 01:09:23.362
but no one should marry
out of obligation.


597
01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:26.492
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl?


598
01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:32.331
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.


599
01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:38.169
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.


600
01:09:41.715 --> 01:09:44.843
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.


601
01:09:51.975 --> 01:09:55.103
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.


602
01:09:58.439 --> 01:10:01.567
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.


603
01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.988
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.


604
01:10:06.447 --> 01:10:09.575
Any time, Lisa McDowell.

605
01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:17.584
Hey! Be careful.

606
01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:21.420
I think my sister likes you.

607
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:32.099
Semmi!

608
01:10:33.599 --> 01:10:36.727
Semmi.

609
01:10:40.356 --> 01:10:43.484
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?


610
01:10:46.905 --> 01:10:50.033
We cannot anger Mr McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.


611
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:55.038
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.


612
01:10:56.039 --> 01:10:59.168
Yes, you are going to work today.

613
01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:02.920
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.


614
01:11:02.921 --> 01:11:06.049
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.


615
01:11:07.593 --> 01:11:10.721
But you are going to work today!

616
01:11:20.147 --> 01:11:22.522
- Hello!
- Hi!


617
01:11:22.523 --> 01:11:25.651
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...


618
01:11:26.445 --> 01:11:29.573
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.


619
01:11:32.451 --> 01:11:35.579
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager


620
01:11:35.704 --> 01:11:38.832
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.


621
01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:42.335
Just two years, huh?

622
01:11:45.755 --> 01:11:48.883
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.


623
01:11:51.345 --> 01:11:54.473
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.


624
01:11:56.558 --> 01:11:59.519
I feel like I owe you a favour.

625
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.648
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.


626
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:07.778
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.


627
01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:12.366
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.


628
01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:16.202
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.


629
01:12:16.203 --> 01:12:19.331
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.


630
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.878
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.


631
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.728
Welcome to my humble abode.

632
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.448
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.


633
01:12:55.324 --> 01:12:58.452
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.


634
01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:07.003
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.


635
01:13:09.465 --> 01:13:12.593
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.


636
01:13:13.552 --> 01:13:16.680
Akeem? Akeem.

637
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:21.809
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.


638
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.938
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

639
01:13:40.746 --> 01:13:43.874
What are you doing?

640
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:48.669
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.


641
01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:56.928
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.


642
01:13:57.178 --> 01:14:00.138
You are being unreasonable.

643
01:14:00.139 --> 01:14:03.267
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.


644
01:14:09.398 --> 01:14:12.109
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?


645
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:15.239
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?


646
01:14:15.364 --> 01:14:18.492
There's a big rat inside.

647
01:14:18.991 --> 01:14:21.910
I think there is no rat.

648
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:25.039
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.


649
01:14:27.584 --> 01:14:30.712
Once again, you have judged correctly.

650
01:14:31.128 --> 01:14:34.257
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.


651
01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:04.871
Excuse me for a moment, please.

652
01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:17.091
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.


653
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.528
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.


654
01:15:36.819 --> 01:15:39.947
Randolph! Randolph!

655
01:15:41.492 --> 01:15:44.620
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!


656
01:15:52.502 --> 01:15:55.630
Mortimer, we're back.

657
01:15:56.089 --> 01:15:59.218
Yeah!

658
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:02.638
To America!

659
01:16:06.057 --> 01:16:08.391
Why did you come here?

660
01:16:08.392 --> 01:16:11.521
- To find something special.
- It's a long way to travel.


661
01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:15.234
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.


662
01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:20.197
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?


663
01:16:21.697 --> 01:16:24.826
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.


664
01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:30.581
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!


665
01:16:30.582 --> 01:16:33.710
Let's have lunch.

666
01:16:36.337 --> 01:16:39.465
You have the most amazing effect
on people.


667
01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:43.011
- No, I don't.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.


668
01:16:45.054 --> 01:16:48.182
People love you.

669
01:16:48.642 --> 01:16:51.770
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.


670
01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:56.650
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.


671
01:16:59.235 --> 01:17:02.363
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal.


672
01:17:07.369 --> 01:17:10.497
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.


673
01:17:14.917 --> 01:17:18.045
- What's that?
- Goat herding.


674
01:17:19.798 --> 01:17:22.926
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

675
01:17:23.093 --> 01:17:26.221
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

676
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:29.599
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.


677
01:17:31.851 --> 01:17:34.979
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.


678
01:17:38.816 --> 01:17:41.944
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.


679
01:17:42.738 --> 01:17:45.866
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.


680
01:17:46.532 --> 01:17:49.660
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl.


681
01:17:50.536 --> 01:17:53.664
Not you.

682
01:17:58.044 --> 01:18:01.172
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.


683
01:18:30.326 --> 01:18:33.454
What about Patrice?

684
01:18:33.496 --> 01:18:36.624
I'm not interested in Patrice.

685
01:18:38.376 --> 01:18:41.212
What about Darryl?

686
01:18:41.213 --> 01:18:44.341
I'm not interested in Darryl, either.

687
01:19:10.242 --> 01:19:13.370
- Do you actually want to send this?
- Why? What is wrong?


688
01:19:14.787 --> 01:19:16.622
Read it to me.

689
01:19:16.623 --> 01:19:19.751
"To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer,
the Royal Palace, Zamunda."


690
01:19:22.546 --> 01:19:25.674
"Sire, Akeem and I
have depleted our funds."


691
01:19:26.884 --> 01:19:30.012
"Kindly send 300,000 American dollars
immediately,"


692
01:19:31.054 --> 01:19:34.183
"as we are in dire straits.
Your humble servant, Semmi."


693
01:19:35.641 --> 01:19:38.227
Semmi.

694
01:19:38.228 --> 01:19:41.356
- Should I make it 400,000?
- Do you think that'll be enough?


695
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:46.319
You are right. 500,000.

696
01:19:46.737 --> 01:19:49.865
As long as you're asking,
why not go for a cool million?


697
01:19:50.281 --> 01:19:53.409
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Nah.


698
01:20:00.958 --> 01:20:03.752
Okay, what's going on?

699
01:20:03.753 --> 01:20:06.881
Patrice...

700
01:20:08.216 --> 01:20:10.718
I came to see Akeem.

701
01:20:10.719 --> 01:20:13.847
What are you involved in?
You can't afford this on your salary.


702
01:20:17.893 --> 01:20:21.021
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss


703
01:20:22.563 --> 01:20:25.691
When you're away
Through here, gone each day


704
01:20:26.776 --> 01:20:29.904
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling


705
01:20:32.156 --> 01:20:35.284
- Quiet! People are trying to sleep.
- Some wish to be a king or a queen


706
01:20:37.704 --> 01:20:40.833
- Some wish forfortune and fame
- Shut up!


707
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:44.044
But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved

708
01:20:46.004 --> 01:20:49.133
It must mean all of these things

709
01:20:51.552 --> 01:20:54.680
Someone to care
Someone to share


710
01:20:55.806 --> 01:20:58.934
Lonely hours and moments of despair

711
01:21:00.644 --> 01:21:03.772
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling


712
01:21:07.985 --> 01:21:11.113
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

713
01:21:12.738 --> 01:21:15.867
Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.

714
01:21:18.537 --> 01:21:21.665
Sorry things didn't work out between
you and me, but you understand.


715
01:21:23.584 --> 01:21:26.712
Goodnight, sweet prince.

716
01:21:34.344 --> 01:21:37.473
Remember, you must not tell a soul.

717
01:21:37.514 --> 01:21:40.642
Your secret is safe with me,
your Highness. Bye...


718
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:53.739
If you're the prince, then who am I?

719
01:21:56.699 --> 01:21:59.827
My servant.

720
01:22:11.465 --> 01:22:14.593
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.


721
01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:18.595
Stay out of this, Dad.

722
01:22:18.596 --> 01:22:21.724
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.


723
01:22:22.683 --> 01:22:25.811
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?


724
01:22:27.897 --> 01:22:31.025
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.


725
01:22:32.151 --> 01:22:35.279
Why don't you marry Darryl?
He dresses nice, he treats you good.


726
01:22:37.365 --> 01:22:40.493
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

727
01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:45.207
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.


728
01:22:46.582 --> 01:22:49.710
I know. Bye, Daddy.

729
01:22:57.009 --> 01:23:00.137
Come in.

730
01:23:01.472 --> 01:23:04.600
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.


731
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:11.023
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?


732
01:23:11.024 --> 01:23:14.153
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.


733
01:23:15.778 --> 01:23:17.655
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

734
01:23:17.656 --> 01:23:20.784
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.


735
01:23:25.371 --> 01:23:28.499
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.


736
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:34.797
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.


737
01:23:38.302 --> 01:23:41.430
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1A.
Downstairs. First floor.


738
01:23:44.098 --> 01:23:47.226
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.


739
01:23:55.986 --> 01:23:59.114
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful?


740
01:25:18.152 --> 01:25:21.280
Who in the hell is that?

741
01:25:31.707 --> 01:25:34.835
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.


742
01:25:41.799 --> 01:25:44.926
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

743
01:25:44.927 --> 01:25:48.055
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.


744
01:25:52.393 --> 01:25:55.521
This is beautiful. 
What is that - velvet?

745
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.859
I have come for my son Akeem.

746
01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.988
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.


747
01:26:04.906 --> 01:26:08.034
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.


748
01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.668
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

749
01:26:26.053 --> 01:26:29.181
You may enter.

750
01:26:35.479 --> 01:26:38.607
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.


751
01:26:47.908 --> 01:26:51.036
- What is this?
- A photograph.


752
01:26:51.494 --> 01:26:53.787
What is this "McDowell's"?

753
01:26:53.788 --> 01:26:56.916
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.


754
01:26:59.168 --> 01:27:02.295
My son works?!

755
01:27:02.296 --> 01:27:05.424
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1A.


756
01:27:19.106 --> 01:27:22.234
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?


757
01:27:22.733 --> 01:27:25.862
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?


758
01:27:27.238 --> 01:27:30.366
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.


759
01:27:31.325 --> 01:27:34.453
Your job was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?


760
01:27:36.497 --> 01:27:39.625
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.


761
01:27:41.752 --> 01:27:43.795
Semmi...

762
01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:46.924
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.


763
01:27:49.511 --> 01:27:52.639
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.


764
01:27:54.892 --> 01:27:58.020
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.


765
01:28:05.818 --> 01:28:08.946
Thank you, your Majesty!

766
01:28:10.365 --> 01:28:13.494
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?


767
01:28:14.703 --> 01:28:17.831
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.


768
01:28:18.582 --> 01:28:21.710
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.


769
01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:33.638
People will see us.

770
01:28:33.971 --> 01:28:36.890
Then let them see. Lisa...

771
01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:39.184
- Let us go.
- Now?


772
01:28:39.185 --> 01:28:42.313
Yes. Right now.

773
01:28:58.037 --> 01:29:01.165
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 p.m.


774
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:07.547
Lisa will be home by then.

775
01:29:07.548 --> 01:29:10.676
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.


776
01:29:11.051 --> 01:29:14.179
Okay, see you later.

777
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:22.479
There's some people here to see you.

778
01:29:25.524 --> 01:29:28.652
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.


779
01:29:35.909 --> 01:29:39.037
What can I do for you?

780
01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:44.375
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.


781
01:29:44.376 --> 01:29:47.504
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?


782
01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.008
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?


783
01:29:53.134 --> 01:29:56.177
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.


784
01:29:56.179 --> 01:29:59.307
I knew there was something special
about that boy.


785
01:29:59.515 --> 01:30:02.643
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.


786
01:30:07.065 --> 01:30:10.194
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.


787
01:30:10.651 --> 01:30:13.111
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.


788
01:30:13.112 --> 01:30:16.240
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.


789
01:30:23.707 --> 01:30:26.835
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.


790
01:30:39.222 --> 01:30:42.350
A prince!

791
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.122
Wait! We cannot go in.

792
01:31:06.123 --> 01:31:08.250
Why not?

793
01:31:08.251 --> 01:31:11.379
Wait in the car. 
I will be right back.

794
01:31:21.473 --> 01:31:24.015
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.


795
01:31:24.016 --> 01:31:26.935
It's not that. 
I feel like I'm rushing you.

796
01:31:26.936 --> 01:31:29.896
No, you're not.

797
01:31:29.897 --> 01:31:33.025
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.


798
01:31:33.777 --> 01:31:36.905
It's better if I take you home.

799
01:31:43.078 --> 01:31:46.206
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.


800
01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:51.252
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.


801
01:31:51.253 --> 01:31:54.381
- I have to get going, Mr McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.


802
01:31:56.048 --> 01:31:57.925
Get out of here, dog.

803
01:31:57.926 --> 01:32:00.385
We don't spend enough time talking.

804
01:32:00.386 --> 01:32:03.181
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.


805
01:32:03.182 --> 01:32:06.310
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.


806
01:32:24.243 --> 01:32:27.371
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

807
01:32:29.332 --> 01:32:32.459
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

808
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.588
Both the kids are here, together.

809
01:32:35.838 --> 01:32:38.966
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.


810
01:32:41.802 --> 01:32:44.931
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

811
01:32:49.143 --> 01:32:52.271
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.


812
01:32:52.647 --> 01:32:55.357
Did you want ice in that?

813
01:32:55.358 --> 01:32:58.486
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

814
01:33:09.372 --> 01:33:12.500
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.


815
01:33:13.919 --> 01:33:17.047
Excuse me.

816
01:33:21.927 --> 01:33:25.055
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!


817
01:33:25.972 --> 01:33:29.100
But you told me to come over.

818
01:33:31.353 --> 01:33:34.481
Now, where were we?

819
01:33:48.828 --> 01:33:51.956
I warned you, didn't I? 
Dottie, get him!

820
01:34:01.424 --> 01:34:04.551
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.


821
01:34:04.552 --> 01:34:06.720
You can stay a little while longer.

822
01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:09.849
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.


823
01:34:11.809 --> 01:34:14.937
Let me go see if they're ready.

824
01:34:17.608 --> 01:34:20.736
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?


825
01:34:21.737 --> 01:34:24.530
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.


826
01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:27.659
Tell your father goodbye for me.

827
01:34:31.079 --> 01:34:33.580
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.


828
01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:36.709
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?


829
01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:40.838
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?


830
01:34:41.423 --> 01:34:44.132
I like the boy.

831
01:34:44.133 --> 01:34:47.261
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.


832
01:34:47.554 --> 01:34:50.222
A man's got a right
to change his mind.


833
01:34:50.223 --> 01:34:53.351
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.


834
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:57.898
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.


835
01:34:58.606 --> 01:35:01.734
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!


836
01:35:04.946 --> 01:35:07.781
- What?
- He's got his own money.


837
01:35:07.782 --> 01:35:10.910
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.


838
01:35:20.963 --> 01:35:24.091
A prince. He's a prince!

839
01:35:26.634 --> 01:35:29.762
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!


840
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.308
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.


841
01:35:47.738 --> 01:35:50.867
I will get out here.

842
01:35:51.285 --> 01:35:54.413
That'll be nine bucks.

843
01:36:16.477 --> 01:36:19.605
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.


844
01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:22.899
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.


845
01:36:24.942 --> 01:36:27.277
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?


846
01:36:27.278 --> 01:36:30.406
Back to Queens.

847
01:36:30.573 --> 01:36:33.701
Look who's here! 
Come in, come in.

848
01:36:34.244 --> 01:36:37.372
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.


849
01:36:47.048 --> 01:36:50.133
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.


850
01:36:50.134 --> 01:36:53.262
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.


851
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:57.558
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?


852
01:36:58.351 --> 01:37:00.518
Very well, thank you.

853
01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:03.648
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.


854
01:37:05.526 --> 01:37:08.654
I feel like break dancing.

855
01:37:08.945 --> 01:37:12.073
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.


856
01:37:14.992 --> 01:37:18.120
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.


857
01:37:18.914 --> 01:37:22.042
Put your feet up.

858
01:37:28.382 --> 01:37:31.300
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.


859
01:37:31.301 --> 01:37:33.719
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.


860
01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.764
You told me my son was here.

861
01:37:36.765 --> 01:37:39.893
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.


862
01:37:41.603 --> 01:37:44.731
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.


863
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:48.277
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.


864
01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:57.327
This is Akeem's father. The King!

865
01:37:57.827 --> 01:38:00.955
Leave us.

866
01:38:08.922 --> 01:38:12.050
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.


867
01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.052
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?


868
01:38:15.053 --> 01:38:17.721
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.


869
01:38:17.722 --> 01:38:20.850
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...


870
01:38:21.851 --> 01:38:24.604
...he cannot be serious about you.

871
01:38:24.605 --> 01:38:27.733
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.


872
01:38:30.359 --> 01:38:32.987
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

873
01:38:32.988 --> 01:38:36.116
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.


874
01:38:37.533 --> 01:38:40.661
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.


875
01:38:42.914 --> 01:38:46.042
Aoleon. Aeolon...

876
01:38:49.086 --> 01:38:52.215
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.


877
01:38:54.635 --> 01:38:57.763
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.


878
01:39:00.849 --> 01:39:03.977
What's the matter, baby?

879
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:11.066
What did you say to my daughter?

880
01:39:11.067 --> 01:39:14.195
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.


881
01:39:14.987 --> 01:39:18.115
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl.


882
01:39:20.159 --> 01:39:23.287
Now, wait a minute!

883
01:39:23.872 --> 01:39:27.000
Oha...

884
01:39:28.626 --> 01:39:31.754
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.


885
01:39:32.922 --> 01:39:36.050
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.


886
01:39:36.385 --> 01:39:39.513
- 2 millions
- You can't buy my daughter off.


887
01:39:40.054 --> 01:39:43.182
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.


888
01:39:43.809 --> 01:39:46.937
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.


889
01:39:47.562 --> 01:39:50.690
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.


890
01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:54.319
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.


891
01:39:57.655 --> 01:40:00.783
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?


892
01:40:01.577 --> 01:40:04.705
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.


893
01:40:05.831 --> 01:40:08.959
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.


894
01:40:14.672 --> 01:40:17.800
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.


895
01:40:18.051 --> 01:40:21.180
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.


896
01:40:22.389 --> 01:40:25.517
He's the Prince.

897
01:40:27.143 --> 01:40:30.271
Who told you that?

898
01:40:36.028 --> 01:40:39.156
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.


899
01:40:40.282 --> 01:40:43.410
How come she always gets
the good ones?


900
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:49.458
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.


901
01:40:54.212 --> 01:40:57.340
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.


902
01:40:57.423 --> 01:41:00.551
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.


903
01:41:02.095 --> 01:41:05.224
So you do care for her?

904
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:09.769
Mother, I love her.

905
01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:12.939
Then go after her.

906
01:41:17.068 --> 01:41:20.196
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.


907
01:41:48.516 --> 01:41:51.644
Darryl, what happened?

908
01:41:52.855 --> 01:41:55.983
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.


909
01:41:59.528 --> 01:42:02.656
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.


910
01:42:07.326 --> 01:42:09.494
Stop!

911
01:42:09.495 --> 01:42:11.664
Lisa!

912
01:42:11.665 --> 01:42:14.793
Lisa!

913
01:42:18.504 --> 01:42:21.632
I will be fine by myself.

914
01:43:11.599 --> 01:43:14.726
Lisa, please.

915
01:43:14.727 --> 01:43:17.855
I did not mean to hurt you.

916
01:43:18.022 --> 01:43:21.150
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.


917
01:43:22.068 --> 01:43:25.196
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...


918
01:43:25.823 --> 01:43:28.951
...and I don't want you.

919
01:43:45.216 --> 01:43:47.009
Just leave me alone!

920
01:43:47.010 --> 01:43:50.139
Lisa, please. I love you.

921
01:43:50.388 --> 01:43:52.932
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?


922
01:43:52.933 --> 01:43:56.060
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?


923
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:59.189
Your father told me -
to sow your royal oats.


924
01:43:59.314 --> 01:44:02.442
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.


925
01:44:05.069 --> 01:44:08.197
So why did you lie to me? Why didn't
you just tell me you were a prince?


926
01:44:09.449 --> 01:44:12.578
I wanted you to love
me for who I am.

927
01:44:13.119 --> 01:44:16.247
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.


928
01:44:17.249 --> 01:44:20.377
Should it matter that I am a prince?

929
01:44:23.005 --> 01:44:24.547
It shouldn't, but I...

930
01:44:24.548 --> 01:44:27.676
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.


931
01:44:37.185 --> 01:44:40.313
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.


932
01:44:40.688 --> 01:44:43.356
You're royalty, for God's sake.

933
01:44:43.357 --> 01:44:45.525
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.


934
01:44:45.526 --> 01:44:48.654
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.


935
01:44:50.072 --> 01:44:53.201
I renounce my throne!

936
01:44:56.789 --> 01:44:59.917
Does this make you happy?

937
01:45:08.508 --> 01:45:11.636
I can't let you do that.

938
01:45:12.137 --> 01:45:15.223
I do not care about my crown.

939
01:45:15.224 --> 01:45:18.352
All I care about is you.

940
01:45:18.435 --> 01:45:21.563
Marry me, Lisa.

941
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:28.737
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.


942
01:45:44.168 --> 01:45:47.296
Look, I'm sorry. I can't.
Goodbye, Akeem.


943
01:45:56.597 --> 01:45:59.725
If you're really a prince, 
I'll marry you.

944
01:47:17.137 --> 01:47:20.265
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.


945
01:47:48.627 --> 01:47:51.755
You're still not speaking to me.

946
01:47:52.631 --> 01:47:55.759
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.


947
01:47:56.218 --> 01:47:59.346
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.


948
01:47:59.888 --> 01:48:03.016
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?


949
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:06.478
Even if she said yes, they still couldn't
marry. It's against the tradition.


950
01:48:07.854 --> 01:48:10.982
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

951
01:48:11.232 --> 01:48:14.360
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.


952
01:49:39.279 --> 01:49:42.407
Your Highness.
We have not come to that part yet.


953
01:49:52.208 --> 01:49:55.336
Your Highness. 
Your Highness!

954
01:50:24.158 --> 01:50:26.866
Would you really
have given this up for me?


955
01:50:26.868 --> 01:50:29.996
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.


956
01:50:33.417 --> 01:50:36.545
Nah!

957
01:51:43.903 --> 01:51:47.031
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Stop right there.


958
01:51:47.073 --> 01:51:49.866
Listen! Stop right there a minute.

959
01:51:49.867 --> 01:51:52.912
A man goes in to a restaurant.
Are you listening?


960
01:51:52.913 --> 01:51:56.041
A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.


961
01:51:57.626 --> 01:52:00.544
He says to the waiter,
"Come, taste the soup".


962
01:52:00.545 --> 01:52:03.588
The waiter says, "Is there something
wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."


963
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:06.717
"Is the soup too hot?"
"Will you taste the soup?"


964
01:52:06.843 --> 01:52:09.928
"Is the soup too cold?"
"Will you just taste the soup!"


965
01:52:09.929 --> 01:52:13.057
"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"


966
01:52:20.231 --> 01:52:23.359
What do you know from funny,
you bastard?
