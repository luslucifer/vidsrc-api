but I want the option.


453
00:20:31.424 --> 00:20:33.761
And apparently,
I'm about to be geriatric.


454
00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:35.596
- [indistinct chatter]
- So...


455
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.633
You could meet
your husband tomorrow
and be engaged in six months


456
00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:40.668
and have your baby the real way.

457
00:20:40.701 --> 00:20:42.103
Yes, like Heidi.

458
00:20:42.136 --> 00:20:43.738
- [all chatter]
- Exactly.


459
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:45.405
Yeah, last week

460
00:20:45.438 --> 00:20:48.341
I sent an unsolicited photo
of my vagina


461
00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:51.344
to a guy who ghosted me
six months ago,


462
00:20:51.913 --> 00:20:55.549
and I got no response,
so, I don't know that I'm Heidi.


463
00:20:55.583 --> 00:20:58.085
Egg freezing
is super expensive, right?


464
00:20:58.119 --> 00:21:00.420
- Didn't I hear it causes
early menopause?
- [Jen] Mmm.


465
00:21:00.453 --> 00:21:05.325
And doesn't each frozen egg
have, like, a 5% chance
of becoming an actual baby?


466
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:08.461
Oh, I don't--
I don't know the stats.


467
00:21:08.495 --> 00:21:10.430
Yeah, that's why
you gotta get, like, 20 eggs.


468
00:21:10.463 --> 00:21:13.366
Most of 'em won't be viable,
and then some
won't survive freezing,


469
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.368
and then thawing
is like a whole other...


470
00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:16.536
- Claire.
- [guests exclaim]


471
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:18.538
She had to do it,
like, three times.


472
00:21:18.573 --> 00:21:19.974
I mean, the first time around,

473
00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:21.943
she took the wrong, like,
trigger shot or whatever


474
00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:25.445
and then she ovulated
like 12 preemies.


475
00:21:25.478 --> 00:21:27.480
And then she had to do it
all over again,


476
00:21:27.514 --> 00:21:29.482
pay for the drugs
all over again.


477
00:21:29.516 --> 00:21:31.786
And then she only got,
like, seven eggs


478
00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:34.021
and then she had to do it
a third time


479
00:21:34.055 --> 00:21:37.959
just to even have a shot
at getting a baby out of it.


480
00:21:38.659 --> 00:21:39.861
Yeah.

481
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.065
But, hey, I am
so super stoked for you.


482
00:21:44.098 --> 00:21:45.600
[indistinct chatter]

483
00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:48.002
- Do you still talk to Shawn?
- Yeah, yeah.


484
00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:50.938
I-I mean, not so much lately,
but there's no bad blood.


485
00:21:50.972 --> 00:21:52.807
Why did you guys break up?

486
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.609
You were such a cute couple.

487
00:21:54.642 --> 00:21:57.645
Uh, well, we were just
on different paths.


488
00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.953
Well, bless.

489
00:22:05.987 --> 00:22:07.822
You do not need a man.

490
00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:09.624
[indistinct chatter]

491
00:22:09.657 --> 00:22:10.992
I know!

492
00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:14.729
[screams] Oh, my God!

493
00:22:14.762 --> 00:22:17.064
- I need to borrow eight grand.
- No.


494
00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:18.766
I need to freeze
my spider monkeys.


495
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:19.901
No.

496
00:22:19.934 --> 00:22:21.602
You said it was the future.

497
00:22:21.636 --> 00:22:24.071
Drive for Uber or give
blow jobs for cash.


498
00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:26.040
- These are my two choices?
- <i>Sophie's Choice.</i>


499
00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:27.474
I've never seen that movie.

500
00:22:27.507 --> 00:22:29.476
Well, now you don't have to.
Look at that.


501
00:22:29.509 --> 00:22:31.946
Why can't you be
a decent human being
for once in your life?


502
00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:34.015
You have a gazillion sperm
in your sac.


503
00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.516
You drive a Tesla. You're rich.

504
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:38.019
I am very comfortable, yes.

505
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:41.155
Look at you,
you bougie bitch. [sniffs]


506
00:22:41.188 --> 00:22:43.591
Oh, my God. [sharp exhale]

507
00:22:43.624 --> 00:22:45.159
Oh, you even smell rich.

508
00:22:45.826 --> 00:22:48.996
You didn't use to smell
like this, like a Redwood cabin
in Yosemite.


509
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.165
You used to smell like butthole.

510
00:22:51.198 --> 00:22:52.833
- [Nellie sighs]
- I've always smelled rich.


511
00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:55.937
Goddamn it, Jesse.
I never ask you for anything.


512
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.105
You asked me
for Coachella tickets
a month ago.


513
00:22:58.139 --> 00:22:59.907
That was a suggested gift.

514
00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:01.175
Why would I buy you gifts?

515
00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:04.011
Because you're the man
in my life.


516
00:23:06.847 --> 00:23:08.916
That is bleak.
That's like so sad.


517
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.118
It's not funny.
Don't smile at that.


518
00:23:11.152 --> 00:23:12.887
That's yucky.

519
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.055
You wanna talk bleak?

520
00:23:14.088 --> 00:23:16.691
If I don't spend 13K
to freeze my eggs,


521
00:23:16.724 --> 00:23:18.025
I might never be able
to have kids.


522
00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:20.493
Meanwhile, you're gonna wait
till you're 70


523
00:23:20.527 --> 00:23:25.066
with your old oatmeal balls
to have a baby
with an influencer.


524
00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:26.901
That is so-
- That is-
- Okay.

525
00:23:27.668 --> 00:23:31.005
That is accurate
and I'm not embarrassed
about it.


526
00:23:31.038 --> 00:23:34.541
Okay, I'm trolling
on Raya hard right now.


527
00:23:34.575 --> 00:23:39.013
So if one of these sloots
wants to catch it when I'm 70,


528
00:23:39.046 --> 00:23:40.948
- so be it.
- I'll pay you back.


529
00:23:40.982 --> 00:23:43.050
- How?
- Well, I was hoping


530
00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:45.019
that we could talk
specifics later.


531
00:23:47.822 --> 00:23:50.191
Okay. I want interest.

532
00:23:51.225 --> 00:23:52.559
Of course, you do.

533
00:23:52.593 --> 00:23:53.828
And I want half.

534
00:23:53.861 --> 00:23:54.795
Half?

535
00:23:55.796 --> 00:23:59.532
- Oh, you want half.
You want half of my eggs.
- Okay, that's my counter.


536
00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:00.868
- Oh, so here's the thing.
- So take it or fuck off.


537
00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:02.603
You don't get to own
half of my eggs,


538
00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:05.206
because this isn't the fucking
<i>Handmaid's Tale.</i>


539
00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:06.974
Get out of my fucking office.
Adults are working.


540
00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:08.309
The adults are working?

541
00:24:08.342 --> 00:24:10.543
You flew to Colombia
to do cocaine.


542
00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:13.681
Get out of my office now. Leave.

543
00:24:13.714 --> 00:24:14.982
Make me.

544
00:24:17.752 --> 00:24:20.287
- Get the fuck out.
I'm not joking.
- Make me. Make me. Make me.


545
00:24:20.321 --> 00:24:21.789
- Get the fuck out.
- [grunts]


546
00:24:21.822 --> 00:24:24.058
- Get out. Okay, stop, stop.
- [screaming]


547
00:24:24.091 --> 00:24:25.558
- No, hey!
- Help me, Hunter.


548
00:24:25.593 --> 00:24:27.094
- She's fine. Shut up.
- Hunter, I'm not fine.


549
00:24:27.128 --> 00:24:29.563
- Shut the fuck up.
- [crying]


550
00:24:29.597 --> 00:24:31.298
- She's okay. She's kidding.
- I'm not okay.


551
00:24:31.332 --> 00:24:32.700
- This is a joke that we do.
- I'm not kidding.


552
00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:33.901
- Shut up!
- It's not a joke.


553
00:24:33.934 --> 00:24:37.004
Go back to work.
Go back to fucking work.


554
00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:38.839
Dude, you are so immature.

555
00:24:38.873 --> 00:24:40.674
You're so fucking immature.

556
00:24:40.708 --> 00:24:44.045
Okay, you know what?

557
00:24:44.078 --> 00:24:46.147
And you're gonna have two months
to pay me back with 1K interest.


558
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.050
And if that folds,
you owe me all the eggs.


559
00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:50.818
They're mine, free and clear.

560
00:24:50.851 --> 00:24:53.954
What the fuck are you gonna do
with my eggs, you sicko?


561
00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:56.290
I don't know.
But I'll be able to do
whatever I want with them


562
00:24:56.323 --> 00:24:58.859
and I don't have to tell you,
because they're
my fucking eggs then.


563
00:24:59.693 --> 00:25:01.862
Goddamn it. Deal.

564
00:25:04.398 --> 00:25:06.867
- I hate you.
- Hey, hey.
Don't fucking tell Dad.


565
00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:07.835
[door opens]

566
00:25:09.937 --> 00:25:13.007
- Thank you, Jess.
- Get the fuck out.


567
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.109
- [phone rings in background]
- [office chatter]


568
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.777
Freak.

569
00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:18.212
So it's ten to 12 days

570
00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:19.880
of injections and ultrasounds.

571
00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.816
Then it's the trigger shot.

572
00:25:21.849 --> 00:25:25.219
Then it's the retrieval surgery,
which I'm under for.


573
00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:27.288
- Surgery?
- [low grunt]


574
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.356
- <i>Pobrecita mi bebé.</i>
- [laughs]


575
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.093
Mom, it's a needle.
It's over in, like, 15 minutes.


576
00:25:32.126 --> 00:25:33.360
And when does it all start?

577
00:25:33.394 --> 00:25:36.964
Any day. I'm just waiting
for my period.


578
00:25:36.997 --> 00:25:38.766
- [Sonja] Mmm.
- Oh, come on, I'm eating here.


579
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:42.870
- Well, we're all rooting
for you, Anita.
- Thank you, Mama.


580
00:25:42.903 --> 00:25:46.240
I can't believe you're paying
thousands of dollars for this
and it's not even guaranteed.


581
00:25:46.273 --> 00:25:48.375
Is anything in this life
guaranteed, Dad?


582
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:51.979
You know what's guaranteed?
Eviction, when you can't pay
your rent.


583
00:25:52.012 --> 00:25:54.014
Well, the universe provides.

584
00:25:54.048 --> 00:25:55.116
Who did--

585
00:25:55.749 --> 00:25:58.419
Don't ever say that again.
Don't ever say that again.


586
00:25:58.452 --> 00:26:00.421
The universe does not provide.

587
00:26:00.454 --> 00:26:02.389
But a husband will.
Go get one of those.


588
00:26:02.423 --> 00:26:05.726
Oh, my God, Dad. A husband.

589
00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:10.297
Yes, I'll just get married,
so that I too can have
a ginger son and a divorce


590
00:26:10.331 --> 00:26:12.867
- by the time I'm 30.
- [Richard] Well, you missed
that boat, didn't you?


591
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.402
You don't get the luxury
of a practice marriage
when you're 33.


592
00:26:15.436 --> 00:26:17.705
I'm 34. You don't even know
how old I am.


593
00:26:17.738 --> 00:26:20.241
Because you were born
so goddamn long ago, I forgot.


594
00:26:20.274 --> 00:26:22.710
You know what?
You should feel guilty.
You should.


595
00:26:22.743 --> 00:26:24.245
- This is your doing,
both of you.
- <i>Yo?</i>


596
00:26:24.278 --> 00:26:27.214
- [Richard] What?
- Actually, the sex talk
you gave me was,


597
00:26:27.248 --> 00:26:29.016
"Don't do it ever,

598
00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:31.285
because you will get pregnant
and your life will be trash."


599
00:26:31.318 --> 00:26:33.888
And then one day I woke up

- I flipped a boat.
- There's a boat?


770
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.419
In high school,
on my marine biology trip
to the wetlands.


771
00:34:52.452 --> 00:34:53.921
My teacher said
it would never happen.


772
00:34:53.955 --> 00:34:56.256
It hadn't happened
in 20 years of teaching,


773
00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:57.659
but I was just trying to put
the mud on my face.


774
00:34:57.692 --> 00:34:59.259
She said it was good
for your skin


775
00:34:59.292 --> 00:35:00.595
and I must have
leaned too far over,


776
00:35:00.628 --> 00:35:02.429
because I capsized the canoe.

777
00:35:02.462 --> 00:35:04.666
And my whole boat had to spend
the rest of the day in the van


778
00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:06.634
and everybody
was super pissed at me.


779
00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:09.771
So what if I flip the boat...

780
00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:13.206
- again?
- Okay.


781

00:49:19.486 --> 00:49:21.789
I mean, I wish forever
would start yesterday.


1053
00:49:21.823 --> 00:49:23.658
- [glass thuds]
- Oh, wow.


1054
00:49:23.691 --> 00:49:26.059
- Yeah.
- Wow, Sterling.


1055
00:49:27.729 --> 00:49:29.196
You're getting married.

1056
00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:31.298
- I did not see that coming.
- [laughs]


1057
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:34.334
And to a nurse, a real nurse.

1058
00:49:34.368 --> 00:49:37.170
- Look at you.
- I overachieved.


1059
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.109
You know, I didn't think
you were the marrying type.


1060
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.311
Why? Why-why do you think that?

1061
00:49:44.344 --> 00:49:46.079
Maybe because when we dated--

1062
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:47.749
- Hung out.
- You were 40,


1063
00:49:47.782 --> 00:49:51.251
had never had a relationship
past three months,


1064
00:49:51.285 --> 00:49:53.387
and worked in a restaurant
where you had fucked


1065
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.724
every other server and hostess
and gave me chlamydia.


1066
00:49:57.524 --> 00:50:00.828
Okay, well,
how does that make me
not the marrying type?


1067
00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:03.497
I really am sorry
that I wasn't your person.


1068
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:06.199
- I'm not. Believe me.
- But you were crazy.


1069
00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:08.736
- Excuse me?
- After nine months
of hanging out,


1070
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:12.707
you come to me with this,
"W-what are we doing?"


1071
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.143
Calm down, huh?
I mean, you said it yourself.


1072
00:50:16.176 --> 00:50:18.713
You were trying to turn me
into something
that I wasn't. Okay?


1073
00:50:18.746 --> 00:50:20.682
At least, not for you.

1074
00:50:22.249 --> 00:50:23.550
You're right.

1075
00:50:23.585 --> 00:50:26.688
I was trying to turn a hoe
into a housewife.


1076
00:50:26.721 --> 00:50:28.756
- Nice. That's-that's
slut shaming.
- [sighs]


1077
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.490
This is the problem with dating.

1078
00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:34.328
Nurse/models are marrying

1079
00:50:34.361 --> 00:50:36.196
We never dated. We hung out!

1080
00:50:36.898 --> 00:50:37.832
[groans]

1081
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:40.802
Here we go.

1082
00:50:44.806 --> 00:50:45.807
Whew.

1083
00:50:47.008 --> 00:50:51.144
How many times a day do you get,
"At least buy me
dinner first, Doc"?


1084
00:50:51.178 --> 00:50:53.447
I never get that. That would be
embarrassing for them.


1085
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.283
Okay. Check 'em out.

1086
00:50:56.316 --> 00:50:57.551
They're growing.

1087
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.723
Can I get a copy of that?

1088
00:51:01.756 --> 00:51:03.591
You want a picture...?

1089
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:06.460
Oh, the-- Yeah, yeah.
Mary. Mary, let's, uh...


1090
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:09.162
Let's get a picture.

1091
00:51:09.196 --> 00:51:12.199
- [bottle pops]
- ["Close" by Leslie Powell
playing]


1092
00:51:22.376 --> 00:51:24.912
- Nellie!
- Hey there, wifey!


1093
00:51:24.946 --> 00:51:26.581
You didn't have to bring a gift.

1094
00:51:26.614 --> 00:51:28.315
- Aw.
- I know you're paying
to freeze your eggs


1095
00:51:28.348 --> 00:51:30.450
- and all that.
- Okay, shut up.
Don't make it weird.


1096
00:51:30.484 --> 00:51:32.452
I'm so happy to see you.
I've missed you.


1097
00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:35.923
Things have just been so crazy
with the remodel and the...


1098
00:51:35.957 --> 00:51:38.158
- Ah...
- Oh, my God.


1099
00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:42.262
You're a Kardashian.
You're gonna get robbed
at gunpoint.


1100
00:51:42.295 --> 00:51:44.464
- I know, right?
- Yeah.


1101
00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:46.500
I have to give you something.
Hold on.


1102
00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:51.606
Your engagement party
and I'm getting gifts.


1103
00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:52.640
What is this?

1104
00:51:54.241 --> 00:51:55.777
"Will you be my bridesmaid?"

1105
00:51:56.276 --> 00:51:58.680
[inhales deeply]
I'm so surprised.


1106
00:51:58.713 --> 00:52:00.648
And I know you're gonna have
the bachelorette party on lock.


1107
00:52:00.682 --> 00:52:03.316
- Yeah, you know it! Uh-huh.
- Yeah!


1108
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.753
[mimics laughter]

1109
00:52:05.787 --> 00:52:07.387
- You know.
- [both giggle]


1110
00:52:07.421 --> 00:52:09.222
Preston and Ember!

1111
00:52:09.256 --> 00:52:14.561
["Dust" plays, distorts]

1112
00:52:15.228 --> 00:52:17.230
- You invited Preston?
- No.


1113
00:52:17.264 --> 00:52:20.702
Oh. Shit, no, I forgot.
They live, like,
five minutes away


1114
00:52:20.735 --> 00:52:22.637
and she's been helping
with the bathroom remodel.


1115
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.706
And Ryan and Preston have been
hanging out. Are you okay?


1116
00:52:24.739 --> 00:52:27.608
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
- Hey there, Mrs. Mayfield!


1117
00:52:27.642 --> 00:52:30.011
- Hey, girl. Hi!
- [both exclaim, smooch]


1118
00:52:30.044 --> 00:52:32.013
[Ember] Let me
see it again. Ooh!


1119
00:52:32.046 --> 00:52:34.247
- You did so good.
- I know, right?


1120
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:36.283
Ugh. Nellie!

1121
00:52:36.316 --> 00:52:38.418
- Hi!
- Hey, Ember. How are you?


1122
00:52:38.452 --> 00:52:40.554
Incredible. [giggles]

1123
00:52:40.588 --> 00:52:42.422
- Hey.
- Hey.


1124
00:52:42.456 --> 00:52:45.492
Um, baby, will you go
get me a LaCroix with lime?


1125
00:52:45.525 --> 00:52:47.527
- <i>Pamplemousse?</i>
- Yeah.


1126
00:52:47.561 --> 00:52:50.565
- Oh, my God, you brought them!
- Oh, yeah. Your favorite.


1127
00:52:50.598 --> 00:52:52.332
- Nell, you gotta try one.
- Oh, okay.


1128
00:52:52.365 --> 00:52:54.001
You'll have to excuse her.
She's addicted.


1129
00:52:54.035 --> 00:52:56.704
- [all chuckle]
- I picked the tomatoes
from my garden


1130
00:52:56.738 --> 00:52:58.773
and I actually made
the mozzarella myself.


1131
00:52:58.806 --> 00:53:01.809
- You made this?
- Mm-hmm. I just
can't trust anything


1132
00:53:01.843 --> 00:53:03.745
in the store-bought stuff
these days, you know?


1133
00:53:03.778 --> 00:53:05.947
- Totally.
- I actually make
all my own cheeses.


1134
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.050
- Do you have a cow?
- [laughs] No, Nellie.


1135
00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:12.620
I don't have a cow.
What is wrong with her?


1136
00:53:12.653 --> 00:53:14.421
So, like, just from
your own breast milk, or--


1137
00:53:14.454 --> 00:53:16.924
- Hello? New business idea.
- [laughter]


1138
00:53:16.958 --> 00:53:18.926
Oh, thank you.

1139
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.696
So, Nell, what have you
been up to these days?


1140
00:53:21.729 --> 00:53:24.031
Are you still doing that, um,

1141
00:53:24.065 --> 00:53:27.602
little, um... Etsy thing? Right?

1142
00:53:27.635 --> 00:53:29.871
- Just doing that little
Etsy thing. Yep.
- Mmm.


1143
00:53:29.904 --> 00:53:31.973
- Great.
- And you? What are you up to?


1144
00:53:32.006 --> 00:53:33.708
Ember is an incredible
interior designer.


1145
00:53:33.741 --> 00:53:37.879
Yes, work has been amazing,
but kicking my ass.


1146
00:53:37.912 --> 00:53:40.648
So I am just beyond ready
to take some time off.


1147
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:45.620
So Preston and I are gonna
spend a couple of weeks
in the Amalfi Coast.


1148
00:53:45.653 --> 00:53:47.588
- [gasps] I'm so jealous.
- [giggles]


1149
00:53:47.622 --> 00:53:50.758
Right where he proposed.

1150
00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:53.661
Positano Beach,
on our last sunset.


1151
00:53:53.694 --> 00:53:55.096
- He was so nervous.
- No...


1152
00:53:55.129 --> 00:53:56.998
He was sweating like a hog.

1153
00:53:57.031 --> 00:53:58.733
- [chuckles]
- Well...


1154
00:53:58.766 --> 00:54:02.435
Truth is, he had the ring
in his pocket the entire trip,


1155
00:54:02.469 --> 00:54:04.806
but every sunset,
he just kept chickening out.


1156
00:54:04.839 --> 00:54:06.540
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw.


1157
00:54:06.574 --> 00:54:08.976
Sounds so romantic.
Would you excuse me?


1158
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.377
Time to pee-pee.

1159
00:54:15.149 --> 00:54:18.820
- Yo! Man of the hour!
- Hey. What's up?


1160
00:54:18.853 --> 00:54:21.022
- What's going on?
Look at all this!
- Oh, my God.


1161
00:54:21.055 --> 00:54:23.390
- Are you kidding?
- I know. I can't believe it.


1162
00:54:23.423 --> 00:54:25.893
Damn it, Nell. I miss you, man.
I feel like I don't see you
anymore.


1163
00:54:25.927 --> 00:54:28.129
- You know, I get that a lot.
- Well, where have you been?


1164
00:54:28.162 --> 00:54:30.131
In the world
of excommunicated singles.


1165
00:54:30.164 --> 00:54:32.066
- Shut up.
- Stop being invited
to the couple shit


1166
00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:33.801
when you're no longer a couple.

1167
00:54:33.835 --> 00:54:35.870
Nell, you're always invited.

1168
00:54:35.903 --> 00:54:40.440
You say that now,
it's not long till you're off
to the world of parents.


1169
00:54:40.473 --> 00:54:41.776
Fuck.

1170
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:43.678
Yikes. Been nice knowing ya.

1171
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:45.545
- [Ryan chuckles] Yeah.
- Mmm.


1172
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.014
Hey, how's Shawn? Or--

1173
00:54:47.715 --> 00:54:50.685
I'm sorry. Well, I don't know.
I mean, do you guys still talk?


1174
00:54:50.718 --> 00:54:53.955
No, um, not so much
lately. He's...


1175
00:54:55.156 --> 00:54:56.724
He's got a new girlfriend.

1176
00:54:56.757 --> 00:54:58.159
Wish them all the best.

1177
00:54:58.192 --> 00:55:01.494
May peace be with them.

1178
00:55:01.528 --> 00:55:03.898
Insert whatever it is
that grown-ups say.


1179
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:07.434
Poor guy. I mean...

1180
00:55:07.467 --> 00:55:09.904
It's gotta suck to lose
someone like you, Nell.


1181
00:55:12.039 --> 00:55:13.506
[inhales deeply]

1182
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.843
Sucks losing someone like him.

1183
00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:19.747
Tell me to fuck off if this is,
like, the stupidest question
ever, okay? But...


1184
00:55:21.148 --> 00:55:24.018
what happened between you guys?

1185
00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:27.922
Nellie! Hi! Wait, sorry.
I just heard about Shawn.


1186
00:55:27.955 --> 00:55:31.926
- Heard what?
- Oh, shit, I thought you
would've seen on the socials.


1187
00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:33.393
No, we're not--

1188
00:55:34.095 --> 00:55:36.529
- Um, he didn't do anything.
- Oh.


1189
00:55:36.564 --> 00:55:38.966
It was more for me,
so that I wouldn't...


1190
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.068
Anyway, what,
what-what happened?


1191
00:55:41.102 --> 00:55:43.604
His new girlfriend.
She's so pretty.
What is her name?


1192
00:55:43.638 --> 00:55:44.805
Michelle.

1193
00:55:44.839 --> 00:55:46.774
- [snaps fingers]
- She's pregnant.


1194
00:55:51.646 --> 00:55:52.713
Wow.

1195
00:55:52.747 --> 00:55:55.716
[soft music playing]

1196
00:55:56.651 --> 00:55:57.585
[sighs]

1197
00:55:58.586 --> 00:55:59.854
Peace be with them.

[therapist] Yes, Nora.

1355
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.889
Whenever you're ready.

1356
01:08:47.922 --> 01:08:50.591
I wrote mine on... [sighs]

1357
01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:55.395
"Dear Winnie. I've lived
most of my life without you.


1358
01:08:56.396 --> 01:09:00.500
But from the moment
I found out you were here,
everything changed.


1359
01:09:01.769 --> 01:09:03.604
I started planning immediately.

1360
01:09:04.404 --> 01:09:08.508
The tea parties we'd have,
the playgrounds I'd take you to,


1361
01:09:09.043 --> 01:09:10.678
driving you to your first dance,

1362
01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:14.949
trying to talk you out
of plucking your eyebrows."

how to cook a chicken,

how to chase your dreams.

1366
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:26.594
It kills me that we never
got to do any of these things.


1367
01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:30.932
I'm so sorry, Winnie."

you chose us to be your moms.

You weren't here very long,

but you have
Mommy's heart forever."


1372
01:09:50.383 --> 01:09:51.919
Beautiful, Nora.

01:09:56.924 --> 01:09:57.925
Yes.

01:09:59.392 --> 01:10:00.962
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.


1377
01:10:00.995 --> 01:10:03.530
No, I'm so sorry. I'm

I'm not actually
going through a--


1379
01:10:05.633 --> 01:10:09.937
I was here for my friend
and-and she's not coming
now, sorry.


1380
01:10:09.971 --> 01:10:12.339
Um, I'm actually...
[light chuckle]


1381
01:10:12.372 --> 01:10:16.010
I'm going through the process
of freezing my eggs right now


1382
01:10:16.644 --> 01:10:23.316
in the hopes that someday I too
can know the joy of miscarriage.


1383
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:25.887
No, no, no, sorry.

1384
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.289
As soon as it was
coming out of my mouth,
I was like, "Abort!"


1385
01:10:32.827 --> 01:10:36.363
Fuck. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

[chuckles]
How has it been so far?


1390
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:50.778
Freezing your eggs?

1391
01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:53.648
Yeah, good, good, good,
good. Yeah. Um...


1392
01:10:55.082 --> 01:10:57.084
I guess it's just like
bringing up some stuff.


1393
01:10:58.485 --> 01:10:59.987
I'm either going through
a renaissance


1394
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:03.858
or amidst the worst crisis
of my lifetime.


1395
01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:06.393
I feel really fucking stupid
talking about this here
when all--


1396
01:11:06.426 --> 01:11:08.930
Nothing is stupid
to talk about here.


1397
01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.002
- Mmm.
- Sit down, please.


1398

Stay.

1399
01:11:19.006 --> 01:11:19.941
Oh.

1401
01:11:24.477 --> 01:11:25.412
Okay.

1402
01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:34.622
Um...

1403
01:11:34.655 --> 01:11:36.624
my ex and I
broke up a year ago.

1404
01:11:39.827 --> 01:11:42.763
He wanted kids.

1405
01:11:42.797 --> 01:11:45.967
He's a bit older than me
and he was tired of waiting.


1406
01:11:46.968 --> 01:11:48.169
[clicks tongue]

1407
01:11:48.202 --> 01:11:50.638
But I wasn't ready.
I'm not ready.


1408
01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.575
So I left.

1409
01:11:58.079 --> 01:12:01.148
I didn't wanna leave.
I really, really
didn't wanna leave.


1410
01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:04.051
But he would have never left me.

1411
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.154
And I couldn't hold him back.

1412
01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:15.196
He's the most amazing human.
Like, the best human.


1413
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:17.999
He's everything. 
He's grown-up.

1414
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:25.139
[smacks lips] He bought his mom
a MacBook Pro for Christmas.


1415
01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:29.043
And he knows how to fold that,
the stretchy sheet with the--


1416
01:12:29.076 --> 01:12:31.078
with the waistband.

1417
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.914
- [women] Fitted sheet.
- The fitted sheet.


1418
01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:36.651
He knows how to fold that
without even YouTubing it.


1419
01:12:39.587 --> 01:12:42.757
He's gonna be
the most epic dad ever.


1420
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.959
Like a dad
from a minivan commercial.


1421
01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:50.998
Ah, his grilled cheese
is always that perfect
golden color.


1422
01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:53.200
It tastes like home.

1423
01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:57.104
He tastes like home.

1424
01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:02.610
So, yeah.

1425
01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:06.147
The past year,
I've sort of been a little...


1426
01:13:08.282 --> 01:13:09.482
homeless.

1427
01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:14.055
My grilled cheese
is always burnt.


1428
01:13:15.623 --> 01:13:16.991
Or cold, unmelted.

1429
01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:23.164
I'm wearing swimsuit bottoms,
'cause I haven't done
my laundry in weeks.


1430
01:13:28.202 --> 01:13:30.503
I did Molly at a wedding
last month.


1431
01:13:33.207 --> 01:13:34.208
Alone.

1432
01:13:42.016 --> 01:13:43.918
I don't really know
what kind of mom I'd be.


1433
01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:50.791
But I'm freezing my eggs.

1434
01:13:53.227 --> 01:13:54.595
Because...

1435
01:13:58.032 --> 01:13:59.767
procreation.

1436
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.002
[chuckles]

1437
01:14:01.035 --> 01:14:03.237
Creating life.

1438
01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:05.906
What? That's...

1439
01:14:08.576 --> 01:14:09.910
That's pretty epic, right?

1440
01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:15.950
A baby is like
the physical manifestation of...


1441
01:14:17.118 --> 01:14:18.119
teamwork.

1442
01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:21.789
Partnership.

1443
01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:29.030
Seems like something
worth fighting for.


1444
01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:36.137
The irony is,

1445
01:14:39.173 --> 01:14:41.541
I don't know
if I've ever felt so...


1446
01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:44.078
alone.

1447
01:14:58.159 --> 01:15:02.263
- This is your final
trigger shot. Okay?
- Yep.


1448
01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:06.333
It must be taken
exactly 36 hours
before your procedure.


1449
01:15:06.367 --> 01:15:08.936
- Okay.
- That means 9:00 p.m. Not 9:01.


1450
01:15:08.969 --> 01:15:13.107
- Not 9:30.
Exactly 9:00 p.m. Okay?
- Okay. Yep.

[Richard] She looks terrible.

- You look terrible. Ew.
- <i>Cállate,</i> Richard.


1462
01:15:59.086 --> 01:16:00.855
I'm a human baby farm
at the moment.


1463
01:16:00.888 --> 01:16:04.358
I'm so sorry if my appearance
isn't to your liking, Commander.


1464
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:06.260
- Hello, hormones.
- Hello.


1465
01:16:06.293 --> 01:16:08.696
- [fork clinks]
- Just today.
Just today. One day.


1466
01:16:08.729 --> 01:16:12.333
Can you pretend to be
a loving, supportive father
just for a day?


1467
01:16:12.366 --> 01:16:14.135
How have I not been supportive?

1468
01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:17.138
How have you been supportive?
All you've done is tell me


1469
01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:19.974
that my egg freezing is voodoo
and I should get back
with Shawn.


1470
01:16:20.007 --> 01:16:21.775
- She's right.
- All I said


1471
01:16:21.809 --> 01:16:25.045
was that this new-age technology
is grotesquely expensive


1472
01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:27.214
- and you don't have the money.
- Accurate.


1473
01:16:27.248 --> 01:16:29.783
- But you do have Shawn.
- Drop it, Richard.


1474
01:16:29.817 --> 01:16:31.952
- I don't have Shawn.
- She doesn't have Shawn.


1475
01:16:31.986 --> 01:16:35.256
All she needs to do
is write him a text
with one of those,


1476
01:16:35.289 --> 01:16:37.391
- the faces thing. What is that?
- Emoji.


1477
01:16:37.424 --> 01:16:39.293
- With an emoji.
- His girlfriend's pregnant.


1478
01:16:42.429 --> 01:16:43.330
<i>¿Qué?</i>

1479
01:16:44.165 --> 01:16:45.432
- What?
- Fuck.


1480
01:16:46.433 --> 01:16:49.303
- [Richard] Is it serious?
- What do you mean
"is it serious"?


1481
01:16:49.336 --> 01:16:51.372
Sounds pretty
fucking serious, Pop.


1482

[Sonja sniffling]

1484
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:57.945
- Are you crying?
- [sniffles]


1485
01:16:57.978 --> 01:17:00.047
- No, I'm okay.
- Yes, she's crying.


1486
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.018
Of course, she's crying.
Hell, I'm about to cry.
No, that--


1487
01:17:04.051 --> 01:17:06.387
that could be you.

1488
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.055
Don't you think
I wanted it to work out?


1489
01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:09.390
Oh, I don't know. Did you?

1490
01:17:09.423 --> 01:17:11.959
No, no, you're right, actually.
I-I really enjoy


1491
01:17:11.992 --> 01:17:14.395
being alone and heartbroken,
and told that my eggs are dying


1492
01:17:14.428 --> 01:17:17.198
while I go to weddings
and baby showers
every goddamn weekend.


1493
01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:19.767
- You enjoy that?
- No, Dad!


1494
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.104
No. I don't enjoy spending $70
to go to fucking stork parties


1495
01:17:24.138 --> 01:17:27.942
where I shower pregnant bitches
with gifts while they act like
they cured cancer.


1496
01:17:27.975 --> 01:17:32.746
"You did it! You had sex
without a condom!"


1497
01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.316
I can do that. I do do that.

1498
01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:36.784
- Jesus Christ.
- <i>¡Ay, Dios mío!</i>


1499
01:17:36.817 --> 01:17:38.419
Where's my party, huh?
I want a party.


1500
01:17:38.452 --> 01:17:40.254
I want a fucking stork party!

1501

Parveen, I don't know

Except that you
probably consider me
a common street whore.

Well, I prefer the term

And not that it's any

1551
01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.102
but I had a boyfriend.

Yeah, I did. For a long time.

1553

you're having a good time,

1564
01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:52.767

the music stops.

you thought it was

It's one long game

1570

Well, I may not have
a chair/man,

or a baby, or a house,

or fancy health insurance,
or my own Verizon plan,


1573
01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:26.734
but I have science.

1574
01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:30.203
Yup. I have enough.
I am enough.


1575
01:23:30.237 --> 01:23:33.608
And I'm not gonna let you,
or my dad, or Ember,


1576
01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:37.311
or any of these dudes
make me feel like I failed,


1577
01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:39.413
because I am doing my best

1578

to take care of me.

1579
01:23:47.421 --> 01:23:50.324
And right now, that means
sticking this needle
in my stomach.


1580
01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:53.560
And I don't know
how junkies do it,
because it hurts, and I'm tired.
