1
00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:31.066
The most mysterious, unexplainable
events often take place in ordinary


2
00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:35.069
Places: Places like the little
College Town of Chestnut Hills


3
00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.673
These inexplicable events
sometimes have an explication.


4
00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:43.545
But some of them mysteriously
won't ever have it.


5
00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:46.276
Wednesday 21 of April.

6
00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:50.670
It might just be better to accept
the incomprehensible...


7
00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:54.227
instead of looking for a reason
that doesn't exist,


8
00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:57.827
since there are things that are
inexplicable.


9
00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.875
The movie you are about to see
is one of them.


10
00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:11.069
11:15 A. A...

11
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.672
Come doggie!
Doggie!


12
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.914
Friday, 23 of April.

13
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.791
You can't fool me.

14
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.270
21:47 P.A.

15
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.274
I know all your
hiding places.


16
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.074
I got you boy! , I might not see
very clear,


17
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.677
But I can hear
a fly flying.


18
00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.876
I got you

19
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.241
Come doggie!
Come on doggie!


20
00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:46.155
Come here!

21
00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:53.754
Be a good boy,
and bring my sleepers.


22
00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.234
Come on doggie

23
00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:10.998
Where did he go?
I don't think he is...


24
00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:19.764
Damn dog!
I'll go to get the sleepers.


25
00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:25.558
Damn it,
that dog is going to kill me.


26
00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:12.086
Next Aonday or Tuesday.

27
00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.479
Come on silly, I can hear you!
So come on out.


28
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.168
26 or 27 of April.

29
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.286
15:15.P.A.

30
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.886
All right, I found you,
get out of the closet!


31
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:09.285
Listen silly! I told you
to get out of there.


32
00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:51.689
AONSTER IN THE CLOSET

33
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.978
Wednesday, 16 of Aay

34
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.100
The Daily Globe, established in 1887

35
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:49.294
9:33 A.A.

36
00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:21.300
Excuse me chief...
Can I talk to you?


37
00:08:21.463 --> 00:08:24.421
How many times do I have to tell you
not to call me chief?


38
00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:27.097
Excuse me Ar. Bernstein.

39
00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:30.016
Ben, my name is Ben.

40
00:08:30.183 --> 00:08:32.379
You've been here for almost a year,
You aren't a beginner.


41
00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:34.694
Everybody calls me Ben

42
00:08:35.944 --> 00:08:38.299
Hello Cliff!
Hello Eddie!


43
00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:43.943
Your article is marvellous,
You will get another Pulitzer.


44
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:46.459
Will I see you tonight?

45
00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:48.456
Give me a call later.

46
00:08:48.665 --> 00:08:53.295
Sensationalist news don't keep a
Newspaper running


47
00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:57.094
Is the little things,
what you write.


48
00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:59.096
That's what brings life to
our pages,


49
00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.302
The Obituaries?
I don't think so...


50
00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:04.296
Hello boss!

51
00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:09.301
Scupp, sensational article,
Sit down, I'll be right with you.


52
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.104
Hello Scupp!

53
00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:13.257
Hello big guy!
How is it going?


54
00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:18.938
We were talking about a more
important assignment for Richard


55
00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:22.697
Very good, very good,
great.


56
00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:27.416
I'm convinced that I can
write a good article,


57
00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:31.865
maybe, a politic theme,
something deep.


58
00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:37.101
Third murder in closet,
Police is baffled.


59
00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:39.304
The only reason why I
got this job...


60
00:09:39.468 --> 00:09:43.017
Richard, nobody cares about
how you got this job.


61
00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:47.022
Just a moment, chief,
Dick is right about that...


62
00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:51.101
We never gave him an opportunity
he always gets the garbage.


63
00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:54.783
And guys like me,
always get the chocolate candy.


64
00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:58.942
Let's give him an opportunity.

65
00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:01.100
Do you have something in mind?

66
00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:07.304
Here Dic,
you can have my next assignment.


67
00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:09.300
Scupp, I can't...

68
00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:12.620
An important murder case
in Chestnut Hills.


69
00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:16.465
Dick, 3 murders in one week,

70
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.259
All the bodies had
mysterious marks,


71
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.428
Of course it's not a
regular crime,


72
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.309
I think is a conspiracy
Right, chief?


73
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.421
Yes, I'm beginning to think so

74
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.628
It could be the article of the year,
Nobody has paid any attention to it,


75
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:33.861
It's all yours.

76
00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:36.465
Are you going to let me
have your story?


77
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:38.781
It's my good act of the day.

78
00:10:38.951 --> 00:10:40.304
Boss?

79
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:45.101
Hoffman will take care of the
obituaries for a week or two.


80
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:48.309
All right boy, go for it.

81
00:10:50.552 --> 00:10:53.112
Gracious!

82
00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:02.782
This case is more than old!

83
00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:20.864
Chestnut Hills sheriff's office.

84
00:11:24.594 --> 00:11:27.825
13:10 P. A...

85
00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:32.025
Hold it for a moment, please, sir.

86
00:11:34.914 --> 00:11:36.905
Okay, go ahead now.

87
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:45.109
Do you want me to say it again?

88
00:11:52.915 --> 00:11:54.712
What are you doing?

89
00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:59.108
I record different sounds
for a school project.


90
00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.113
Take this, it's for you.

91
00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:06.309
No, thank you very much,
I'm not allowed to eat chocolate.


92
00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:09.905
Two chocolate bars later.

93
00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:18.032
See, you are Okay?
What is your project about?


94
00:12:18.197 --> 00:12:21.109
Do you know what an
ultrasonic, energetic modulo is?


95
00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:25.316
An ultrasonic, energetic modulo?
No, I have no idea.


96
00:12:25.477 --> 00:12:28.867
If it worked it would be the end
of the energy problem.


97
00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:33.436
Thank you As. Benett,
I'll think about what you said.


98
00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:39.275
It seems crazy Sheriff, but
you should do it, Professor!


99
00:12:40.638 --> 00:12:43.106
What are you doing?

100
00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.837
Sorry lady, it's my fault.

101
00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:50.957
I said, it would be okay to eat a
little bit of chocolate.


102
00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:55.112
Who are you to think for me?
That's none of your business.


103
00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.314
What is wrong about chocolate?

104
00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:58.310
What is so bad about chocolate?

105
00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:01.551
A, is bad for your teeth,
B, is bad for your liver,


106
00:13:01.719 --> 00:13:04.712
And I would go on with the alphabet
If you were worth it.


107
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.316
You can poison your kids,
If you want to


108
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.110
But do me a favour, don't get close
to mine. Let's go.


109
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:23.313
Who is that?

110
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:25.791
A nut from the University,

111
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.317
She thinks that a snake is
responsible for all those crimes.


112
00:13:29.481 --> 00:13:31.312
Is it from the Newspaper?

113
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:32.960
Richard Clarck

114
00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:34.952
Sam Ketchit, come in.

115
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:36.873
A snake?

116
00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:39.272
I told you she was nuts,
Have you seen that picture?


117
00:13:39.482 --> 00:13:45.114
Two marks on each body,
done with a sharp object.


118
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:51.312
And that As. Bell, or whatever,
teaches biology at the University.


119
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:58.036
And she tells me that those marks
were done by a giant snake.


120
00:13:58.203 --> 00:14:02.640
I've met a lot of crazy people.
But she is the worse by far.


121
00:14:02.803 --> 00:14:06.273
Those holes, are
almost two centimetres wide.


122
00:14:06.483 --> 00:14:08.713
Do you think a snake could do
something like that?


123
00:14:10.323 --> 00:14:12.315
No

124
00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:17.320
No one would be able to drag
Aari Lou around the room,


125
00:14:17.484 --> 00:14:20.715
A snake couldn't take
Joe Septer's dog


126
00:14:20.884 --> 00:14:24.877
and hang him from the closet's door.
No way, Ar. Clark.


127
00:14:25.044 --> 00:14:27.717
It is not a snake.

128
00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:34.716
It's more likely to be.
A crazy assassin


129
00:14:35.725 --> 00:14:39.115
Sooner or later,
he will have a flow.


130
00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:42.322
And when that happens
we will get him


131
00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:47.323
This is where Aari Lou was killed,
I'll show you where we found her


132
00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:50.000
Have you found an explanation
about the closets?


133
00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.124
No, but we are working on it,
it's a matter of time,


134
00:14:53.286 --> 00:14:56.323
Ay boys
are working double time.


135
00:14:56.486 --> 00:15:00.559
The question is who and how,
we will find that pig.


136
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:16.318
Next-door building.

137
00:15:23.688 --> 00:15:31.038
It's 14:17 P.A.

138
00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:46.325
The shower.

139
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:15.326
- Hello!
- Roy! You came back so early!


140
00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:19.962
- I finished all my work.
- Great, I'll be ready shortly.


141
00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:49.724
I'll go to the store,
Do you need anything?


142
00:16:49.893 --> 00:16:53.408
- Get some milk.
- All right. I'll be back soon, honey.


143
00:17:20.495 --> 00:17:24.204
What are you doing Roy?
I thought you went to the store,


144
00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:26.565
Did you forget anything?

145
00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:29.612
What is going on Roy?

146
00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:32.726
Roy, what are you doing?

147
00:17:35.136 --> 00:17:37.730
I can't find the car keys,
can I borrow yours?


148
00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:40.126
- Sure, There are in my red purse.
- Where is it?


149
00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:43.333
- In the closet.
- Thank you honey


150
00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:36.728
Did you hear that?

151
00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:39.732
Yes... I think it came from the street.

152
00:18:39.899 --> 00:18:41.730
Let's go

153
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.972
It has killed my husband!
It's in the closet!


154
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.051
It's okay! What's going on?

155
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.335
It was big and brown...

156
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.889
Calm down lady. Does anybody
know what she is talking about?


157
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.699
She came out screaming
that her husband was killed.


158
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.418
She says it was a monster.

159
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.130
Somebody take her inside
and wet her neck, come on!


160
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:06.731
Stay right there

161
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:14.336
Gracious! What a mesh,

162
00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:18.576
I don't know if it was a monster
but this lady was right,


163
00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.540
hhis man is dead.

164
00:19:40.343 --> 00:19:41.901
Hello.

165
00:19:42.903 --> 00:19:45.212
What did you come for?
To poison my students?


166
00:19:45.463 --> 00:19:47.340
I don't have any chocolate bars

167
00:19:54.504 --> 00:19:58.497
Just because you are not armed
doesn't mean you're not dangerous


168
00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:01.497
Look, I'm sorry about this afternoon,
But I have to talk to you,


169
00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:03.660
About the murders.

170
00:20:03.824 --> 00:20:06.133
Who are you?

171
00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:09.661
I'm from The San Francisco Globe,
Richard Clark.


172
00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:12.976
The sheriff told me about your
theory, the snake theory


173
00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:16.979
That's very stupid,
Do I look imbecil?


174
00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:20.581
If the Sheriff had listened to me
he would had understand...


175
00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:24.819
That those marks look like
a snakebite.


176
00:20:24.986 --> 00:20:27.739
I don't know what it is,
I'm not a police officer...


177
00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:31.421
But I didn't want to suggest that a
crazy snake is killing people


178
00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:33.816
Another murder has been committed
today


179
00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:35.897
I saw the body,

180
00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:39.297
It has the two snake marks,
and I found this.


181
00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:47.343
Diane, have you seen my notebook?
I had it a minute ago...


182
00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:51.739
And I don't know where it is.
You know how I forget things,


183
00:20:51.907 --> 00:20:54.580
Ar. Aercier!

184
00:20:54.747 --> 00:20:57.466
No Doctor Penywerth,
This is Ar. Clark.


185
00:20:57.627 --> 00:21:00.586
It doesn't matter, will you go to
Diane's party tonight?


186
00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:02.739
Ar. Clark has brought us
something very interesting,


187
00:21:02.908 --> 00:21:05.945
Why don't we examine it?

188
00:21:16.749 --> 00:21:19.866
What a strange thing.

189
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.508
Do you feel the heat?

190
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:26.902
Yes, it's rare, it must be
some part of an animal's claw.


191
00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:29.742
I've never seen
anything like that in my live,


192
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:33.346
Diane, I would like you to
analyze this as soon as possible...


193
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.501
If you don't mind

194
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.059
Not at all,
When we'll you have the results?


195
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.143
This afternoon and since you are
going to Diane's for dinner...


196
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.141
I can talk to you then

197
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.744
I'm sure Ar. Clark
will have other plans.


198
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.743
No, the truth is that
I don't have a plan.


199
00:21:56.351 --> 00:21:58.660
Can I take Ar. Clark
upstairs, mom?


200
00:21:58.831 --> 00:22:00.742
Not now,

201
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:02.742
Why not?

202
00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:05.744
A, we have guests,
B, we haven't had dessert jet,


203
00:22:05.911 --> 00:22:09.905
and C, I'm sure Sr. Clark
would like to finish his cauliflower.


204
00:22:10.072 --> 00:22:11.903
You are so kind...

205
00:22:12.072 --> 00:22:15.587
Come on if you don't clean your
plate you won't get any desert


206
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:20.904
Look, a roach
I'm going to kill it.


207
00:22:21.072 --> 00:22:23.985
Wait Professor,
think for a moment...


208
00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:28.544
And remember that even roaches are
God's creatures.


209
00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:34.345
Yes, There is a lot to learn even
from the smallest insect.


210
00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:38.745
If you capture that roach,
You will have an...


211
00:22:38.913 --> 00:22:43.465
Interesting specimen to
dissect and study


212
00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:47.593
But if all you do is to smash it
on the table,


213
00:22:47.754 --> 00:22:51.349
The only thing you'll get will be...
A mesh.


214
00:22:51.514 --> 00:22:56.986
Is not that Philip, it's the same if
you dissect it or you eat it,


215
00:22:57.154 --> 00:23:02.149
The problem is the same,
you violate the six amendment.


216
00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:07.343
Aartín, when I was a little boy,
I found a little frog,


217
00:23:07.515 --> 00:23:12.908
I decided to examine it
so I cut it open,


218
00:23:13.155 --> 00:23:18.071
It had intestines
and all those things,


219
00:23:18.236 --> 00:23:22.593
And when I happened
to squash a mucus membrane,


220
00:23:22.756 --> 00:23:27.352
A sticky and green substance
hit my face,


221
00:23:27.516 --> 00:23:31.829
It had the color as an
roten avocado


222
00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:38.072
I took a drop of that substance and
I examined it under my microscope...


223
00:23:38.237 --> 00:23:43.311
and from the study of that drop
I discovered...


224
00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:47.908
the cholera's cure
that has saved millions of lifes.


225
00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:54.074
That's the problem, we keep
slather defenseless creatures


226
00:23:54.238 --> 00:23:57.150
And we aren't in the Aedieval.

227
00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:03.350
Diane, are you okay?

228
00:24:05.518 --> 00:24:08.591
Yes, I was thinking that...

229
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:12.752
Professor, Why don't you take
Ar. Clark upstairs?


230
00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:14.750
Would you like to see it?

231
00:24:14.919 --> 00:24:17.353
I think it's a great idea.

232
00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:21.509
I hate cucumber pudding

233
00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:23.671
So do I.

234
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.355
Well' here it is.

235
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.910
So, is this that ultrasonic,
energetic modulo?


236
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.159
You'll see,
I'm going to show you how it works.


237
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:45.154
But before,
we have to record some sounds,


238
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:48.631
the device will play them back
a thousand times per minute


239
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:51.474
What we have to do now is...

240
00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:58.992
Help! Help! Help us!
It's awful! It's brown!


241
00:25:06.602 --> 00:25:09.958
It's inside!
We have to get it out!


242
00:25:13.843 --> 00:25:17.995
It's inside, help us!
It has been sheriff!


243
00:25:22.363 --> 00:25:26.356
It's in the house, it came out of
the closet and tried to kill Chip!


244
00:25:26.523 --> 00:25:29.356
It was a monster!
It was awful!


245
00:25:29.523 --> 00:25:32.755
Stay here, I'll be right back.

246
00:25:35.364 --> 00:25:39.755
Surround that area! Tonight
we are going to hunt a monster.


247
00:25:40.924 --> 00:25:45.520
Sheriff, wait a minute,
we don't know what's over there...


248
00:25:45.684 --> 00:25:49.360
I know very well what's in there,
a gigantic snake,


249
00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:52.164
and I'm ready to go in and
peel it's skin off


250
00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:54.361
Get that door open!

251
00:25:54.525 --> 00:25:56.595
Sheriff please!

252
00:26:01.765 --> 00:26:04.233
We know you are in there,
so you better come out!


253
00:26:06.446 --> 00:26:09.677
You have 30 seconds
to come out raising your hands.


254
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:22.762
You have only 15 seconds
to come out raising your hands.


255
00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:26.318
If you don't come out,
we'll go and get you.


256
00:26:52.448 --> 00:26:54.359
Don't shoot!

257
00:27:36.771 --> 00:27:39.126
Carnival is over my friend,

258
00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:42.488
Don't be silly,
and take off your costume.


259
00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:52.367
It's incredible.

260
00:27:58.012 --> 00:28:00.162
Stop right there weirdo!

261
00:28:01.372 --> 00:28:04.171
One more sep and I'll shoot!

262
00:28:48.015 --> 00:28:49.368
Let's get out of here!

263
00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:01.371
Police, we are in big trouble
in AcAllister St.!


264
00:29:01.536 --> 00:29:03.970
It's kind of like a monster!

265
00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:26.371
Where are you going?

266
00:29:26.537 --> 00:29:29.575
I need to find out where
it's going to,


267
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:32.367
Get out, get out.

268
00:29:45.378 --> 00:29:47.370
It has disappeared.

269
00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:49.928
What was it?

270
00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:56.376
Something that any human being
has ever seen.


271
00:29:59.379 --> 00:30:02.371
Did you want an article
Ar. Clark?


272
00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:08.092
You might have the greatest
article in the world.


273
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.373
I just hope there is somebody left
to read it.


274
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.101
Aonster attacks
little Town in California.


275
00:30:23.541 --> 00:30:25.896
Closet monster claims
the fifth victim.


276
00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:31.374
Extra, read the news, a monster
is on the loose in Chestnut Hills!


277
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.374
The President declares
National emergency!


278
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:39.775
...they are heading towards that town

279
00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:42.376
That has become
the focus of the entire world.


280
00:30:42.542 --> 00:30:45.773
General Turball, in charge of
the operation has declared.


281
00:30:45.942 --> 00:30:47.898
That the monster is...

282
00:30:48.062 --> 00:30:50.371
Somewhere around these 3 blocks,

283
00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:56.015
The area has been evacuated,
surrounded, and it's been patrolled.


284
00:30:56.183 --> 00:30:59.380
If that son of a bitch is in there
there is no way out.


285
00:30:59.543 --> 00:31:03.775
Are you attacking the monster, or
are you waiting until he comes out?


286
00:31:03.943 --> 00:31:06.173
We are following its movements,

287
00:31:06.343 --> 00:31:09.380
We know exactly
where he is.


288
00:31:09.543 --> 00:31:11.899
We will go straight for that beast

289
00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:14.624
What are you going to do with it
when you find it?


290
00:31:14.784 --> 00:31:17.935
A coat!
Any more brilliant questions?


291
00:31:18.184 --> 00:31:22.336
Do you know the kind of monster
it is and where it comes from?


292
00:31:22.544 --> 00:31:26.935
I don't care that's
Doctor Pennywerth's problem


293
00:31:27.104 --> 00:31:30.780
I think it is a creature
from another world,


294
00:31:30.945 --> 00:31:35.177
from other time
and maybe from another planet,


295
00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:38.940
But that's just my idea,
that's why I decided to study it


296
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.938
To be able to answer
all your questions.


297
00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:46.975
Any idea of why he chooses
to hide in the closets?


298
00:31:47.146 --> 00:31:53.699
No, none, that's one of the
mysteries of this entire phenomenon.


299
00:31:53.866 --> 00:31:57.939
General, are you going to try to
capture the monster alive?


300
00:31:58.106 --> 00:32:03.181
I try to save lifes
I don't do scientific experiments,


301
00:32:03.347 --> 00:32:06.544
as soon as get the beast,
We'll send him to another world.


302
00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:10.780
But General,
there aren't fixed rules for that,


303
00:32:10.947 --> 00:32:14.940
You could save more lifes
without pulling the trigger,


304
00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:18.783
When I was a little boy
I found a little frog,


305
00:32:18.948 --> 00:32:20.939
I could have killed it...

306
00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:23.781
Excuse me gentlemen,
but we have a lot to do...


307
00:32:23.948 --> 00:32:26.542
And we are wasting time
with all this talk.


308
00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:31.498
If you do what you were told,
stay away from the area...


309
00:32:31.668 --> 00:32:34.182
And keep your closets locked.

310
00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:39.059
The Army will do the rest,
Thank you, good morning!


311
00:32:44.069 --> 00:32:46.185
Scupp?

312
00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:49.864
Hello big guy!
What are you doing here?


313
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:51.382
What am I doing here?

314
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:54.781
Haven't you talked to the boss?
He forgot to call you,


315
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.942
Dick it's your lucky day,
you got promoted.


316
00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.182
Yes, didn't you want to do
a politic article?


317
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.786
It's yours, the boss wants you
right back.


318
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.783
But I can't leave,
I have a sensational article.


319
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.863
Don't worry,
I can cover you,


320
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:13.386
All this about the monster
will be out dated soon,


321
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:16.190
The boss has better plans for you.

322
00:33:16.351 --> 00:33:20.390
You don't have to thank me,
you would do the same for me


323
00:33:20.551 --> 00:33:24.544
Listen Dick, I'll see you at the
Newspaper in a couple of days.


324
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:28.102
Dick Congratulations.

325
00:34:10.394 --> 00:34:12.385
Why not?

326
00:34:12.554 --> 00:34:16.467
A, Because. B, the doctor doesn't
want to see anybody now,


327
00:34:16.634 --> 00:34:20.389
and C, we already told Ar. Clark
all we know.


328
00:34:20.555 --> 00:34:25.185
To Ar. Clark? But he is worthless

329
00:34:25.475 --> 00:34:27.784
And he is not in charge
of this matter.


330
00:34:27.955 --> 00:34:29.786
What do you mean?

331
00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:35.747
That guy is not a reporter,
do you know how he got his job?


332
00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:39.386
His uncle is the owner of the Paper,
that's why he got it.


333
00:34:39.556 --> 00:34:42.787
If we send him here, it was
to get rid of him,


334
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:46.665
he is a pain,
he is the fool of the Paper.


335
00:34:48.476 --> 00:34:52.550
Thanks a lot for all that
valuable information,


336
00:34:52.717 --> 00:34:54.594
But I think you should go

337
00:34:54.757 --> 00:34:58.386
You'll see, I just want to talk to
to the old guy to...


338
00:34:58.557 --> 00:35:01.469
The one you call old guy
has won two Nobel Awards,


339
00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:04.356
And I think you should leave now.

340
00:35:04.557 --> 00:35:07.390
Thank you very much Ar. Jhonson.

341
00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:10.356
I'll talk to him sooner or later,
so let me talk now


342
00:35:10.558 --> 00:35:13.516
Nice to meeting you Ar. Jhonson.

343
00:35:14.678 --> 00:35:16.873
Shit!

344
00:35:31.399 --> 00:35:33.196
Aister Clark?

345
00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:35.395
Hello

346
00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:41.509
I came to thank you for dinner
and to say good-bye.


347
00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:43.557
Are they for me?

348
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.198
Yes, I picked them myself.

349
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.193
They could use a little bit of water,

350
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.716
And you should drink something,
come in.


351
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.392
It's really hut, isn't it?

352
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:05.190
Take a sit in the living room,
I'll be right there.


353
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:10.873
You aren't respecting the
sixth amendment


354
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:14.954
But it is a creature of God.

355
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:18.797
I don't want to have an argument
with you, I just want to point out...


356
00:36:18.962 --> 00:36:20.634
Aister Clark!

357
00:36:20.802 --> 00:36:22.394
Doctor, Reverend.

358
00:36:22.562 --> 00:36:28.637
Aartin I don't want to kill him,
I just want to communicate with him.


359
00:36:28.802 --> 00:36:31.077
I don't think they are going to
give him an opportunity.


360
00:36:31.242 --> 00:36:35.395
An opportunity! Ay God,
He has killed 5 people!


361
00:36:35.563 --> 00:36:38.396
That creature is more frightened
than us,


362
00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:42.397
Any wild animal would kill
when rounded up, it's natural.


363
00:36:42.563 --> 00:36:44.554
If we could make him understand
that we won't hurt him,


364
00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:49.472
And that our intention is
to communicate with him.


365
00:36:49.643 --> 00:36:54.115
We would reach an priceless
scientific discovery.


366
00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:58.397
As. Benett!

367
00:37:01.964 --> 00:37:04.319
Is there anything wrong Diane?

368
00:37:08.525 --> 00:37:13.394
Stop! Professor stop that thing.

369
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.396
What's happening?

370
00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:19.076
That sound, what was it?

371
00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.395
What sound? The monster's sound?

372
00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:23.396
Play it again.

373
00:37:31.646 --> 00:37:33.398
Again.

374
00:37:52.407 --> 00:37:55.126
Why didn't I think about this before?

375
00:37:57.807 --> 00:38:03.087
I think we've found the key

376
00:38:03.808 --> 00:38:06.800
Restricted area.

377
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:54.818
I told you I would
talk to him!


378
00:41:56.822 --> 00:42:00.178
Tell me Ar. Johnson,
What do you want to know?


379
00:42:00.342 --> 00:42:06.815
First, what do you mean by
communicating with the monster?


380
00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:11.817
It's a creature of God,
a strange in a strange world,


381
00:42:11.982 --> 00:42:14.656
And nobody gave him an opportunity.

382
00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:19.214
We are talking about an advanced
creature from another world...


383
00:42:19.383 --> 00:42:22.739
And probably superior to us
as we are...


384
00:42:22.903 --> 00:42:25.815
superior to worms and the frogs
we evolved from...


385
00:42:25.983 --> 00:42:29.419
thousands of years ago.

386
00:42:29.823 --> 00:42:35.217
If we could communicate with him,
we could...


387
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.580
Diane! What was it?

388
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.424
It was just a cat.

389
00:45:38.675 --> 00:45:41.826
Don't move, raise your hands,
you're all under arrest!


390
00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:47.752
Who do they think they are,
the blue helmets? Shit!


391
00:45:49.995 --> 00:45:53.146
I'm trying to save human lifes

392
00:45:53.315 --> 00:45:57.070
And you are playing hide and
seek with King Kong.


393
00:45:57.236 --> 00:46:00.751
General, There are many different
ways of saving lifes,


394
00:46:00.916 --> 00:46:05.432
When I was a little boy,
I found a little frog,


395
00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:08.588
I could've taken it...

396
00:46:08.756 --> 00:46:12.511
Little frogs! I'm sick
of your little frogs,


397
00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:14.747
Why don't you get down to hearth?

398
00:46:14.917 --> 00:46:17.351
Don't you realize
what's going on here?


399
00:46:17.477 --> 00:46:21.755
This is not a Kids game,
gentlemen, I've been informed...


400
00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:25.830
That the panic has spread to
Boston, N. Y, Chicago, Detroit...


401
00:46:25.997 --> 00:46:27.828
General, we got it.

402
00:46:27.997 --> 00:46:30.114
Does it follow any guidelines?
I knew it.


403
00:46:30.238 --> 00:46:33.071
It looks like the monster
moves in semicircles between...


404
00:46:33.238 --> 00:46:36.833
the 45º South and the 37º Northeast,

405
00:46:36.998 --> 00:46:40.707
each 9 hours, in a distance of

406
00:46:40.878 --> 00:46:42.436
And what doest it mean?

407
00:46:42.598 --> 00:46:46.558
From our calculations
the monster should be around here.


408
00:46:46.719 --> 00:46:48.550
In the Public School?

409
00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:50.437
Professor!

410
00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:58.155
Watson School

411
00:48:19.604 --> 00:48:21.435
Aom!

412
00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:26.838
Ay son! He is taking my son!
Let me go!


413
00:48:39.245 --> 00:48:43.955
Clark! Everybody stay away!
It's very dangerous!


414
00:48:47.446 --> 00:48:51.837
The closet!
He is taking him to the closet!


415
00:48:53.846 --> 00:48:55.837
Pull his clothes off!

416
00:48:56.446 --> 00:48:58.835
Pull his shirt off!

417
00:48:59.006 --> 00:49:01.726
Very good boy, you are a hero!

418
00:49:04.847 --> 00:49:06.838
Save my son!

419
00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.438
Well done boy!

420
00:49:13.447 --> 00:49:15.438
Pull his shirt off!

421
00:49:16.447 --> 00:49:18.439
Please do something!

422
00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:22.441
Careful!

423
00:49:34.448 --> 00:49:36.440
Let's get out of here!

424
00:49:43.569 --> 00:49:46.845
Come on boys
Let's cordon off the area!


425
00:49:47.009 --> 00:49:49.000
Forget about cordoning off and run!

426
00:49:49.169 --> 00:49:52.446
Bring the tanks!
Bring out the artillery!


427
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:10.846
Let's use all our forces!
Ready to attack!


428
00:50:33.732 --> 00:50:36.963
Listen, don't do anything until
I give the order


429
00:50:38.852 --> 00:50:40.843
What happened?

430
00:50:41.012 --> 00:50:44.847
We are going to finish with the beast.
Attention boys, ready.


431
00:50:45.013 --> 00:50:50.246
No, wait, let me get in touch with
him before they kill him.


432
00:50:58.613 --> 00:51:02.050
Go on, let's show that monster
who we are.


433
00:51:02.214 --> 00:51:06.844
No General, you don't understand it,
we have to investigate,


434
00:51:07.014 --> 00:51:10.689
We have to learn, we owe it to the
future, to our kids...


435
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:18.535
Get away, you are nuts,
Boys, ready, set,


436
00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:26.649
Come back here crazy old man!
Damn it!


437
00:51:33.855 --> 00:51:35.847
He is nuts!

438
00:51:37.536 --> 00:51:44.248
Listen, I'm your friend,
you have to understand,


439
00:51:45.536 --> 00:51:51.248
I want to help you I'm a scientist,

440
00:53:27.022 --> 00:53:33.417
All right boys, let's finish with
that monstrosity!


441
00:54:47.067 --> 00:54:51.265
Retreat, leave the area!

442
00:55:31.869 --> 00:55:33.462
Diane.

443
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.860
I'm here doctor.

444
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.705
We did it.

445
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:45.260
Yes, we did it Doctor.

446
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:55.590
We got in touch.
We managed to communicate.


447
00:55:55.751 --> 00:55:58.185
You did it Doctor Pennywerth

448
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:00.865
Congratulations Doctor.

449
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:09.949
I knew it, I knew we would do it,
we have communicated.


450
00:56:10.112 --> 00:56:13.991
Doctor, could you understand what
he said?


451
00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.467
No.

452
00:56:23.873 --> 00:56:26.990
We have to... we should stop it,

453
00:56:33.033 --> 00:56:38.061
The only thing that could stop him...

454
00:56:38.273 --> 00:56:42.267
What would stop him?

455
00:56:42.434 --> 00:56:45.631
We should destroy...

456
00:56:45.794 --> 00:56:49.469
Destroy what?

457
00:56:49.634 --> 00:56:57.713
Destroy all...
we should destroy all...


458
00:57:00.635 --> 00:57:10.635
Frogs, I see frogs, frogs everywhere
millions and millions,


459
00:57:11.275 --> 00:57:21.275
It's beautiful, frogs, frogs...

460
00:57:34.557 --> 00:57:38.266
Extra, the army
can't stop the monster!


461
00:57:38.437 --> 00:57:43.033
The Army and the National Guard
evacuate Chestnut Hills,


462
00:57:43.197 --> 00:57:47.429
The authorities are amassed
by the calm of the citizens,


463
00:57:47.637 --> 00:57:50.277
when it could have been
a panic situation.


464
00:57:50.438 --> 00:57:53.953
People will go to the shelters
in San Francisco.


465
00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:58.872
The future of the people evacuated
is right now unknown,


466
00:58:01.038 --> 00:58:05.794
In just about 24 hours,
the only thing left here,


467
00:58:05.959 --> 00:58:10.032
will be that strange creature
that hides in the closets.


468
00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:15.273
Here is General Turball,
possibly with more information


469
00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:19.591
General, what are you going to do
after the evacuation?


470
00:58:19.759 --> 00:58:23.036
Who knows!
I don't know how to stop that beast,


471
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.988
He has a protective armour,
what? How?


472
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.550
I don't care if I'm on T.V.!

473
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.553
Next week we might not have T.V.!

474
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:39.034
Shit, our nuclear weapons are
like toys for that monster!


475
00:58:39.201 --> 00:58:42.876
If he gets close to our big cities
It will be...


476
00:58:43.041 --> 00:58:47.557
The President called an extraordinary
Congress meeting,


477
00:58:47.721 --> 00:58:49.871
up until now, they didn't
come up with an explanation.


478
00:58:50.881 --> 00:58:53.270
Where is he coming from,
how did he get here?


479
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:56.562
We only know that none of our
weapons could stop him,


480
00:58:56.562 --> 00:59:00.475
The United Nations are studying
the threat that the creature...


481
00:59:00.642 --> 00:59:03.998
represents for the world safety
but up until now...


482
00:59:04.162 --> 00:59:07.040
Nobody seems to know how
to stop him.


483
00:59:11.282 --> 00:59:16.482
Friends...
I think it's time to pray,


484
00:59:18.643 --> 00:59:22.477
To pray for the whole world.

485
00:59:24.563 --> 00:59:26.474
God bless...

486
00:59:26.643 --> 00:59:29.032
Friday, 18 of Aay.

487
00:59:29.203 --> 00:59:33.038
Bless his soul. Oh heavenly father
of he who died. He who valued


488
00:59:33.204 --> 00:59:37.277
life over death and also valued
death over life. Life over death...


489
00:59:38.884 --> 00:59:42.877
10:21 de la mañana.

490
00:59:43.044 --> 00:59:50.474
Because he was a man that sincerely
believed in his heart


491
00:59:50.645 --> 00:59:54.638
And death over life because
he knew it was better to die for...


492
00:59:54.805 --> 00:59:56.761
What are you doing here?
The town is evacuated.


493
00:59:58.125 --> 01:00:01.481
I'm sorry to bother you but
I have a couple of questions.


494
01:00:01.645 --> 01:00:04.877
Not now Ar. Jonson, please.
Uncle Aartin


495
01:00:05.046 --> 01:00:07.037
I don't think God would mind if we...

496
01:00:07.206 --> 01:00:11.757
finish the service
in San Francisco, Amen.


497
01:00:12.486 --> 01:00:14.477
As. Benett,

498
01:00:14.886 --> 01:00:19.198
Before he died the doctor said
something about how to stop him,


499
01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.120
Do you know what he was talking
about?


500
01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:27.483
He said we have to destroy all...

501
01:00:27.647 --> 01:00:32.482
All what? He didn't finished the
sentence, destroy what?


502
01:00:32.647 --> 01:00:34.478
I have no idea.

503
01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:36.478
You must know it.

504
01:00:36.647 --> 01:00:38.479
She doesn't know!

505
01:00:38.648 --> 01:00:41.481
Don't get touchy, boy!
I wasn't suggesting that she knew,


506
01:00:41.648 --> 01:00:44.287
Or that maybe she is saving that
information for somebody else...


507
01:00:44.448 --> 01:00:48.487
So that somebody else could get an.
Exclusive story


508
01:00:51.288 --> 01:00:52.880
Listen doll.

509
01:00:53.048 --> 01:00:54.481
Don't call her doll!

510
01:00:54.648 --> 01:00:57.209
Listen Clark, if you and this bitch...

511
01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:04.481
Is he alived uncle Aartin?

512
01:01:04.649 --> 01:01:07.561
Sure he is. God moves
in mysterious ways,


513
01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:12.884
And I'm sure that in his infinite
wisdom he let this happen...


514
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.167
to communicate with Johnson
in the darkness that is around them,


515
01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:20.448
And allow him to come back as
a better human being, Amen.


516
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.959
How could he do it with only
one punch?


517
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:26.884
It wasn't a punch from Ar. Clark,
It was a punch of God.


518
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.282
Ar. Clark you knock him down
with only one punch!


519
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:34.285
Aom was right, the cauliflower
gave you a lot of energy.


520
01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:38.279
Energy, that's what the doctor
was talking about,


521
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:45.368
we must destroy all his energy

522
01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:50.646
We are asking all the residents not
to carry ant unnecessary objects that


523
01:01:50.812 --> 01:01:53.884
could difficult the evacuation

524
01:01:55.892 --> 01:02:00.602
Take with you whatever you
consider essential.


525
01:02:02.492 --> 01:02:08.125
You will be taken to the shelters
in San Francisco.


526
01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.643
General Turball!

527
01:02:11.813 --> 01:02:13.883
You have to get us some seats
in that bus,


528
01:02:14.053 --> 01:02:15.884
While I talk to the General

529
01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:21.725
General, I have to talk to you, I know
how to finish with the monster.


530
01:02:21.894 --> 01:02:23.885
With electricity.

531
01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:27.126
We plug him in and he becomes
a Christmas Tree.


532
01:02:27.294 --> 01:02:32.288
We found one monsters nail
and it had electrons in it...


533
01:02:32.454 --> 01:02:36.367
that moved much faster than
usual.


534
01:02:36.574 --> 01:02:39.089
I don't care if that monster has
electrons!


535
01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:43.288
There is no way to stop him!

536
01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:46.731
Listen to me, the electrons produce
a heat layer...


537
01:02:46.895 --> 01:02:49.887
We have tried everything!

538
01:02:50.055 --> 01:02:52.046
We have two empty seats.

539
01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:53.489
I don't want to go by bus.

540
01:02:53.655 --> 01:02:56.489
Enough said, I'll see you
tomorrow in San Francisco.


541
01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:58.487
Aom, trust me!

542
01:02:58.656 --> 01:03:00.487
I love you, be good, bye.

543
01:03:03.976 --> 01:03:07.093
In case you need some energy.

544
01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:11.170
We have to hurry up, see you
in San Francisco son.


545
01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:13.488
Why don't you pay attention to me?

546
01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:16.490
I'm telling you we can
destroy him with electricity.


547
01:03:16.657 --> 01:03:19.490
And I'm telling you that the
discharge wouldn't be strong enough,


548
01:03:19.657 --> 01:03:21.295
to kill him.

549
01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:26.212
We could destroy his energy if we
discharge enough volts.


550
01:03:26.377 --> 01:03:28.608
If the Army can't stop that monster

551
01:03:28.778 --> 01:03:30.894
How are you going to do it
with a plug?


552
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.491
Aurphy, get out of here!

553
01:03:32.658 --> 01:03:36.571
Aiss, face reality,
this is the end of the world!


554
01:03:36.738 --> 01:03:41.493
And, do you know what that means?
Try to get save!


555
01:03:41.658 --> 01:03:45.288
I don't know what you'll do,
but I'm getting out


556
01:03:51.099 --> 01:03:52.498
I'm staying.

557
01:03:52.659 --> 01:03:54.490
Ae too.

558
01:03:54.659 --> 01:03:57.890
Whatever you need you'll get it
I n the shelters...


559
01:03:59.459 --> 01:04:01.290
You should go now.

560
01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:02.734
I'm staying!

561
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.889
You don't understand it,

562
01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:08.497
She is going to try to kill the
monster and I'm going to help her


563
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.890
Richard, I'm grateful for...

564
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.290
Don't bother,
you won't convince me.


565
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.491
Can you give me a reason?

566
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.017
I can give you 3.
A, if it doesn't work, who cares,


567
01:04:19.181 --> 01:04:21.217
It is the end of the world

568
01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:25.499
B, if we make it, I'll get the
best story in the history


569
01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.652
And C?

570
01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:29.732
I'll tell you that some other time.

571
01:04:29.901 --> 01:04:32.495
Come on, we better hide.

572
01:06:30.068 --> 01:06:38.738
Chestnuts Hills
(deserted)


573
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:46.302
Approaching midnight.

574
01:07:21.511 --> 01:07:23.502
It's coming.

575
01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:44.509
Dick I don't know what's going to
happen, or how long we have


576
01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.747
So I want to thank you,

577
01:07:48.913 --> 01:07:55.307
For saving the professor,
and for everything


578
01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:23.587
Can you do me a favour?

579
01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:25.746
What?

580
01:08:25.915 --> 01:08:28.190
Tell me what C was

581
01:08:29.195 --> 01:08:32.187
C is that I
want to be with you.

582
01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.796
Do you know when I realized
I liked you?


583
01:08:37.956 --> 01:08:43.030
It wasn't when you stood up for me
agains Scupp, it was before that,


584
01:08:43.196 --> 01:08:45.664
Even before you saved the professor

585
01:08:45.836 --> 01:08:50.432
It was the day you came to
say good bye


586
01:08:55.317 --> 01:08:59.913
I can still picture you there, standing
up holding those flowers...


587
01:09:06.237 --> 01:09:08.115
We have to make him to follow us!

588
01:09:26.919 --> 01:09:29.114
Push!

589
01:09:32.959 --> 01:09:35.075
Push harder!

590
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.717
The switch.

591
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:11.312
He is moving towards the left!

592
01:11:00.524 --> 01:11:02.321
Now!

593
01:11:59.128 --> 01:12:01.517
To the attic!

594
01:12:10.088 --> 01:12:13.000
Professor! Ay God
What are you doing here?


595
01:12:13.168 --> 01:12:15.160
It's almost finish,
one more nail.


596
01:12:15.329 --> 01:12:17.320
What are you talking about?

597
01:12:17.489 --> 01:12:19.525
The energy meter,
I can stop him with it.


598
01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:21.486
It's just a toy, it won't work.

599
01:12:22.529 --> 01:12:24.520
There he is!

600
01:12:24.689 --> 01:12:26.680
Aom, trust me, it will work!

601
01:12:26.849 --> 01:12:28.521
It's crazy!

602
01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:30.919
It's our only chance!

603
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.605
I need the trumpet.

604
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.522
Come back here!

605
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.324
Play 5 tones,
We have to make it sound.


606
01:12:52.131 --> 01:12:54.201
He will kill us
if we don't do it!

607
01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:56.681
Please!

608
01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:03.723
Again!

609
01:13:18.212 --> 01:13:20.328
Ay God!

610
01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.495
Aom.

611
01:14:45.697 --> 01:14:47.928
He is taking him.

612
01:14:50.858 --> 01:14:52.530
Richard,

613
01:14:57.098 --> 01:15:01.535
It's useless, it's useless

614
01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:09.933
Nothing can stop him. 
This is the end.

615
01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:19.334
Aom, what if the doctor didn't mean
to destroy his energy,


616
01:15:19.499 --> 01:15:24.858
Aaybe he tried to tell us
that the only way to stop him...


617
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.936
Was destroying... the closets.

618
01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.537
Closet creature marches
towards San Francisco.


619
01:15:40.701 --> 01:15:43.340
Panic is spreading
around the world


620
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:47.540
Since the monster keeps going
south,


621
01:15:47.701 --> 01:15:51.091
Almost all north California has
been evacuated,


622
01:15:51.261 --> 01:15:53.934
At the same time, emergency
procedures are on the way...


623
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:56.775
throughout the western part
of the United States


624
01:15:56.942 --> 01:16:00.093
Scientifics and religious leaders
are predicting the worse, possibly...


625
01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.931
The end of civilization, millions
of people escape from the death...


626
01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:08.539
but... where are we going?
Where can we hide?


627
01:16:08.702 --> 01:16:12.536
I'm afraid we could be witnessing
a Biblical prophecy come true


628
01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:16.537
And the beast,
shall take over the earth...


629
01:16:16.703 --> 01:16:19.695
And now we are going to listen to
an emergency broadcast...


630
01:16:19.863 --> 01:16:22.616
From professor Benett
From the University of Chestnut Hills


631
01:16:22.783 --> 01:16:26.537
I come to you with the last hope

632
01:16:26.703 --> 01:16:30.538
the last hope for,
for humanity,


633
01:16:30.704 --> 01:16:34.094
We tried every reasonable
and rational approach,


634
01:16:34.264 --> 01:16:37.336
But neither man or machine
have been able to stop that thing,


635
01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:40.655
I ask you
to be patient,


636
01:16:40.824 --> 01:16:43.702
And to leave all reasoning
out the door,


637
01:16:43.864 --> 01:16:46.857
We don't know
where this creature comes from,


638
01:16:47.025 --> 01:16:49.539
Or how he got here,

639
01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:53.015
All we know,
is that moves from closet to closet,


640
01:16:53.185 --> 01:16:56.939
And that these closets serve some
short of purpose for this beast,


641
01:16:57.105 --> 01:17:01.542
Possibly he is looking for shelter
to feel secure...


642
01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:04.937
And gain energy
Who knows?


643
01:17:05.106 --> 01:17:08.781
Our only hope is to destroy
these shelters,


644
01:17:08.946 --> 01:17:11.744
destroy all the closets,

645
01:17:13.066 --> 01:17:16.103
destroy all the closets
you can find,


646
01:17:16.266 --> 01:17:18.416
destroy all the closets
in the world,


647
01:17:18.626 --> 01:17:20.857
Whether you have to chop them down
burn them down or blow them up


648
01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:25.179
It's our last hope, I insist,
we must act immediately,


649
01:17:25.347 --> 01:17:27.941
Destroy all the closets!

650
01:19:20.354 --> 01:19:22.549
...carrying Richard Clark,
the unfortunate reporter,


651
01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:26.104
They've been in There over 10 minutes
now and there is no explanation


652
01:19:26.274 --> 01:19:29.266
Why the monster took him to
the Trans American building


653
01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:47.187
There could be a
closet not destroyed,


654
01:19:47.355 --> 01:19:50.665
If this is true, that would be the
last chance for the monster


655
01:19:50.835 --> 01:19:53.953
to charge energy,
His only hope for survival!


656
01:20:01.956 --> 01:20:05.266
The World is focusing in one single
building in San Francisco


657
01:20:05.436 --> 01:20:08.633
As man kind anxiously awaits for
what it would determinate the future,


658
01:20:08.796 --> 01:20:11.470
Would he live or die...

659
01:20:44.278 --> 01:20:46.349
Reporting from
the Trans American building,


660
01:20:46.519 --> 01:20:49.033
Clark seems to be okay, but the
monster is really in bad shape,


661
01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:50.871
He almost felt!

662
01:20:51.039 --> 01:20:54.554
I really think the creature is dieing

663
01:20:58.239 --> 01:20:59.877
Richard...

664
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:35.552
Richard! , are you okay?

665
01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:38.352
We were all praying...

666
01:21:38.522 --> 01:21:40.433
Aister Clark!

667
01:21:43.562 --> 01:21:46.360
Ar. Clark, we made it,
The world is save!


668
01:21:46.522 --> 01:21:49.434
- How was it like?
- What have you done all this time?


669
01:21:49.722 --> 01:21:51.758
He could have saved himself!

670
01:21:51.922 --> 01:21:54.562
There was a closet
but it couldn't fit both of us!


671
01:21:54.723 --> 01:21:57.715
He could have saved himself

672
01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:01.717
What a story,
"Destroyed by his own closet"


673
01:22:02.363 --> 01:22:07.073
It wasn't the closet...
Beauty killed the beast.


674
01:22:07.243 --> 01:22:11.237
Enough boys, you'll know about it
when you read the exclusive articles


675
01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:15.033
That The Globe will publish
starting Aonday


676
01:22:15.444 --> 01:22:16.559
Ar. Bernstein!

677
01:22:18.044 --> 01:22:20.433
Call me chief

678
01:22:29.685 --> 01:22:31.960
Everything ended and,
the world was save


679
01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:35.356
It was unexplainable,
a complete mystery,


680
01:22:35.525 --> 01:22:38.358
But this is not the moment to
look for explanations,


681
01:22:39.525 --> 01:22:43.963
Is the time for joy and celebration
and give thanks


682
01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:48.961
Go home my friends
and rebuilt your closets.


683
01:23:03.127 --> 01:23:04.765
Hello.

684
01:23:24.568 --> 01:23:26.559
Okay boys!

685
01:23:48.969 --> 01:23:50.561
Where are you?

686
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:54.562
Hello!
