1
00:03:52.722 --> 00:03:54.206
Good morning, babe.

2
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:55.241
Mm.

3
00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.003
Morning darling.

4
00:03:58.038 --> 00:03:59.764
Daddy!

5
00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:02.560
Oh!

6
00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:05.804
Momma said that when
my tooth falls out,


7
00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.530
the tooth fairy will
give me some money.


8
00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:08.876
What?

9
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:10.671
Is that true?

10
00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:11.672
Really, Momma said that?

11
00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:12.984
Mm-hmm.

12
00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:14.226
Yes, it is true.

13
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:19.093
I want to help you buy
the house in Thailand.


14
00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:21.579
Oh, you want to help me?

15
00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.270
You hear that?
- I do hear that.


16
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.903
I think that's a good deal.

17
00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.169
I do, too.

18
00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.620
Alright, let me
take a look at it.


19
00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:30.104
Hello?

20
00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.174
Oh.

21
00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:32.209
Hello?

22
00:04:33.832 --> 00:04:34.730
Hello?

23
00:04:34.764 --> 00:04:36.663
Oh, it's very unstable.

24
00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.634
But it's worth a few bucks.

25
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.270
That was the fourth
time this morning.


26
00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:01.066
Okay, what does
your day look like?


27
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.654
I have a class this morning.

28
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.898
Then meetings all day long.

29
00:05:06.693 --> 00:05:09.765
Okay, I'm taking Sophie
to school in a bit,


30
00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:13.251
and then I'm going grocery
shopping, and then Sophie has...


31
00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:15.702
Yes, yes, ballet tonight.

32
00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:17.842
I'm guessing I'm the
one picking her up too.


33
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.328
Please?

34
00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.675
Don't
give me that face.


35
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.263
- Please.
- Stop it.


36
00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:27.645
You're dirty, you're dirty.

37
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:29.923
Thank you.

38
00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:30.957
Thank you.

39
00:06:19.697 --> 00:06:23.597
Honey, I need
money for groceries.


40
00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:37.922
Are you gonna play
tooth fairy tonight?


41
00:06:38.888 --> 00:06:39.888
I'll try.

42
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.754
. Make sure you have
a good day, okay?


43
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.179
And remember who loves you.

44
00:07:13.854 --> 00:07:16.305
Greetings and salutations.

45
00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.339
Greetings.

46
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.102
Hello.

47
00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:21.413
You must be Mr. McQueen.

48
00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:24.451
Mrs. Hanson?

49
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:25.970
Please, call me Lizzy.

50
00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:08.115
Ellis Construction's
assets in part use of value.


51
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.843
Well, after
reading the report,


52
00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:13.983
I say we dismantle the
rest of those products,


53
00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:17.746
but we keep the parts
of Ellis Construction


54
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.472
that can excel our growth
and make us profitable.


55
00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.062
Micro fiber chips.

56
00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:30.136
Sir?

57
00:08:32.484 --> 00:08:33.382
Sir?

58
00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:37.454
Yeah, sorry.

59
00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.286
Run that, that last
part by me again


60
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.254
the part about growth.

61
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.840
Satnam.

62
00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:30.922
Satnam.

63
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.969
Satnam.

64
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.909
If any of you would like
some private classes,


65
00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:54.049
please make sure that you put

66
00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:54.877
on the form.
- Hot yoga?


67
00:09:54.912 --> 00:09:55.947
Hot yoga as well.

68
00:09:55.982 --> 00:09:57.131
I wrote my number on the form.

69
00:09:57.155 --> 00:09:59.157
Do you do also
more intense classes?


70
00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:01.366
It depends on the need
of the person, you know.


71
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.540
Whatever you need, you know,

72
00:10:02.574 --> 00:10:03.862
I can provide.
- Thank you so much.


73
00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:05.163
- Thank you.
- I appreciate you.


74
00:10:05.198 --> 00:10:06.416
Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.


75
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.545
- Thank you.
- Saturday.


76
00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:08.926
Okay, thank you.

77
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.065
Thank you.

78
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:10.893
Thank you very much.

79
00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:11.894
Okay, my Instagram.

80
00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:12.999
Your Instagram is there?

81
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:14.483
- Yeah.
- Okay, beautiful.


82
00:10:14.517 --> 00:10:17.072
Alright, everybody put
their email address, yeah?


83
00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:18.418
- Yeah.
- And their numbers?


84
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:20.834
- Right there.
- Okay, I appreciate you.


85
00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:21.490
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.


86
00:10:21.524 --> 00:10:22.491
Thank you so much.

87
00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:24.148
Thank you again.
- We'll see you.


88
00:10:24.182 --> 00:10:26.081
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you, yes.


89
00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:41.579
Would you
like some water?


90
00:10:41.613 --> 00:10:42.613
Yes, please.

91
00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:46.895
These pictures are beautiful.

92
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:49.000
You have a good eye.

93
00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:50.036
Thank you.

94
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.486
It's been a while since
I picked the camera up.


95
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:56.111
Haven't really been inspired.

96
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.150
Did you
do this one as well?


97
00:11:04.015 --> 00:11:05.015
I did.

98
00:11:06.052 --> 00:11:07.432
It's not my usual style though.

99
00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:11.022
Interesting.

100
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:41.741
Yeah?

101
00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:45.539
Sir, you have a
Mr. Plaxton here to see you.


102
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.234
Okay, send him in, Marsha.

103
00:12:00.347 --> 00:12:01.521
Mr. Hanson.

104
00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:03.005
I have another
meeting in a minute,


105
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.111
so can we keep this brief?

106
00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.147
Yes sir, no problem.

107
00:12:10.116 --> 00:12:13.671
Mea Culpa Apartments,
Apartment 111, two days ago.


108
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.441
Again, Apartment 111.

109
00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:27.685
Same two days every week.

110
00:12:30.136 --> 00:12:32.414
She block booked the place.

111
00:12:32.448 --> 00:12:35.003
She's at it for a
couple of months now.


112
00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:36.037
Paid cash.

113
00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:41.526
They should be meeting tonight.

114
00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:49.914
Alright.

115
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:54.298
Well, as I said I do have
another meeting in a minute,


116
00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:58.095
so thank you, Mr. Plaxton,
we'll be in touch.


117
00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:03.307
Everything's on
that pen drive.


118
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:06.517
I also got the photos you
requested of the other two women.


119
00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:12.385
Great, thank you.

120
00:13:26.502 --> 00:13:28.056
Hey, dear.

121
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.090
McQueen.

122
00:13:31.714 --> 00:13:33.130
- So good to see you.
- You too.


123
00:13:33.164 --> 00:13:35.097
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.


124
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:42.173
No, not now later, thank you.

125
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.106
Hello, Mr. McQueen.

126
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:01.296
How you feeling?

127
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.538
On top of the world.

128
00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:04.299
Like I always am
when I'm with you.


129
00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:06.715
You're gonna see
me Tuesday, right?


130
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:08.165
Like I just told you today,

131
00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:10.650
you have to give
it three months.


132
00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.110
So, you don't
wanna see me anymore?


133
00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:16.621
No, listen you're
in a positive place.


134
00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:18.520
This is the best
you've ever been.


135
00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:20.384
What if I regress?

136
00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:21.730
Remember to yourself.

137
00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:25.320
Beauty and age are
only in the mind?


138
00:14:26.217 --> 00:14:27.253
Correct.

139
00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:45.202
Why don't we start
with the painting?


140
00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:46.272
The painting?

141
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.690
The painting is just a painting.

142
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.358
You know, every
beautiful thing


143
00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:56.420
has some kind of hidden pain.

144
00:14:57.904 --> 00:14:58.904
What's yours?

145
00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:01.321
Well, there's none.

146
00:15:03.358 --> 00:15:04.393
It's just a painting.

147
00:15:05.774 --> 00:15:07.396
Is it how you see yourself?

148
00:15:09.398 --> 00:15:11.297
Hidden in plain sight?

149
00:15:46.263 --> 00:15:47.436
Yeah?

150
00:15:47.471 --> 00:15:49.369
You see those
pictures of Esther?


151
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.406
Yeah.

152
00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:54.823
Well, I know where
he'll be tonight.


153
00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:55.857
You still down?

154
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.830
Family should stick together.

155
00:16:05.454 --> 00:16:06.628
Fine, count me in.

156
00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:09.355
You're sure?

157
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:10.389
Yeah.

158
00:16:11.426 --> 00:16:12.426
Good.

159
00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:14.532
Then we're on for tonight.

160
00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:27.338
Good afternoon,
Ellis Construction.


161
00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:28.581
It's me did you get it?

162
00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:33.413
Yeah, give me a minute.

163
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:44.976
You satisfied?

164
00:16:57.403 --> 00:16:58.990
I gotta go call you right back.

165
00:17:01.407 --> 00:17:02.718
Shit!

166
00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:04.306
Fuck!

167
00:17:11.382 --> 00:17:13.384
665 grand?

168
00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:16.456
That's
right, sir, $665,000.


169
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:17.526
Thank you.

170
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.771
She withdrew that
this afternoon?


171
00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:22.462
Yes, Mr.
Hanson, in cash.


172
00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:23.774
Uh-huh.

173
00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:27.398
Alright, well, thanks
for keeping me informed.


174
00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:28.572
I appreciate it.

175
00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:29.997
Is there anything
else I can help you with?


176
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:32.507
No, that's
it for now, thank you.


177
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:34.347
Thank you for banking
with First American Bank,


178
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:37.028
Mr. Hanson, make sure
you have a very good day.


179
00:17:42.413 --> 00:17:43.863
My doctor thinks the reason

180
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.245
I can't conceive
is psychological.


181
00:17:50.697 --> 00:17:53.666
Your mind has to
arrive at its destination


182
00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:56.876
before your body does.

183
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.950
My husband wants a child now.

184
00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:07.438
And you what do you want?

185
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.516
A child with someone
I can connect with.


186
00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:38.054
Lizzy.

187
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:42.161
Lizzy.

188
00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:49.065
Lizzy.

189
00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:52.966
Sweetheart, is that you?

190
00:18:55.693 --> 00:18:57.385
You're home early.

191
00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:01.492
Yeah, I had to come
back and get a few things.


192
00:19:01.527 --> 00:19:02.804
You having a little bath?

193
00:19:02.838 --> 00:19:05.082
I had a class at the gym.

194
00:19:09.604 --> 00:19:11.433
Okay, enjoy.

195
00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:33.781
You okay?

196
00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:36.335
Yeah.

197
00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:39.857
You know, I never
realized before how


198
00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:43.274
clearly you can see
things from here.


199
00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:28.078
You look beautiful, Mrs. Hanson.

200
00:22:31.702 --> 00:22:36.707
Hey, why don't we
go out tonight, huh?


201
00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:39.595
Go do something or go
dancing at the Grand?


202
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.130
Come back here afterwards
and maybe we can try again?


203
00:22:47.994 --> 00:22:50.756
Most fertile the
next few days, right?


204
00:22:54.794 --> 00:22:56.002
It's girls' night tonight.

205
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.905
Maybe we can do
that tomorrow night,


206
00:23:03.078 --> 00:23:04.366
and then come back
here and try again.


207
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.390
Sure.

208
00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:15.297
I left a plate of food
in the fridge for you.


209
00:23:15.332 --> 00:23:17.921
I'll probably just grab
something on the way home.


210
00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:24.928
I've gotta go.

211
00:23:24.962 --> 00:23:25.962
Okay.

212
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:28.103
I'll see you.

213
00:23:48.917 --> 00:23:50.747
I love you, Lizzy Hanson.

214
00:23:56.097 --> 00:23:58.409
I love you, Richie Hanson.

215
00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:21.044
Hey, hey, hey, my queens.

216
00:25:21.078 --> 00:25:22.390
Hey babe.

217
00:25:22.424 --> 00:25:24.323
Sophie just got into bed,

218
00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:26.221
and she wanted to
tell you goodnight.


219
00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:29.086
- Alright.
- Daddy.


220
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:31.226
My tooth just fell out.

221
00:25:31.261 --> 00:25:33.021
I was a brave girl.

222
00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:35.127
She was.

223
00:25:36.887 --> 00:25:38.026
That's my girl.

224
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:41.858
When is the tooth fairy
gonna come with my money?


225
00:25:42.513 --> 00:25:43.860
When you go to bed.

226
00:25:43.894 --> 00:25:45.862
You have to fall
asleep first, okay?


227
00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:47.001
So, now go to bed.

228
00:25:48.243 --> 00:25:50.176
Goodnight, love you.

229
00:25:50.211 --> 00:25:52.213
Goodnight, I love you.

230
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:54.593
Mm-hmm.

231
00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:57.943
So, how's the
schedule looking?


232
00:25:57.977 --> 00:26:00.462
I'm down to my
last client now,


233
00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:04.846
so I might come home early
in three or four hours.


234
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:06.503
I'll see you then.

235
00:26:56.622 --> 00:26:57.865
So.

236
00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:04.112
Here's the plan.

237
00:28:57.777 --> 00:28:59.952
Reported
that the old fire hall


238
00:28:59.987 --> 00:29:01.136
is still burning out of control.

239
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.162
There are no
reports of injuries,


240
00:29:03.197 --> 00:29:05.475
but a three block area
has been evacuated.


241
00:29:06.648 --> 00:29:08.409
And to business the stock market

242
00:29:08.443 --> 00:29:10.169
fell through the floor today.

243
00:29:10.204 --> 00:29:11.619
No one seems to
have predicted this,


244
00:29:11.653 --> 00:29:14.035
so it's hard to know
where it's heading.


245
00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:24.011
Stay in the moment.

246
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:31.569
Breathe.

247
00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:55.732
That's it.

248
00:29:55.766 --> 00:29:56.766
That's it.

249
00:30:00.288 --> 00:30:01.288
And drink.

250
00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:40.339
Police in
Canada have smashed up


251
00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:42.779
a multi-million dollar
drug smuggling ring.


252
00:30:42.813 --> 00:30:44.815
Police say the raid was
centered in Columbia


253
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.646
with drugs finding their
way into large city centers.


254
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.821
25 people have been arrested,
and face charges ranging from


255
00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:52.178
distributing to possession

256
00:30:52.202 --> 00:30:54.687
for the purpose of trafficking.

257
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:08.115
His
legs, get his legs!


258
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:09.149
Shit!

259
00:31:17.607 --> 00:31:18.539
Hey!

260
00:31:46.532 --> 00:31:48.120
When we have our answers,

261
00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:49.535
we will have our revenge.

262
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.537
I want this guy in a grave.

263
00:31:51.572 --> 00:31:52.814
Mm.

264
00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:54.402
He's
awake sit him up.


265
00:32:08.244 --> 00:32:10.142
Who are you?

266
00:32:11.523 --> 00:32:13.594
What do you want from me?

267
00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:27.435
Where's the bag?

268
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.404
I'll get it.

269
00:32:34.408 --> 00:32:35.409
Here you go.

270
00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:42.519
What do
you want from me?


271
00:32:42.554 --> 00:32:43.796
Huh?

272
00:32:43.831 --> 00:32:45.143
Oh, yeah.

273
00:32:50.355 --> 00:32:52.150
No, no, no.

274
00:32:54.497 --> 00:32:55.498
Who are you?

275
00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:01.297
Who are you?

276
00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:06.336
No, no, no, no., no, no.

277
00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:11.341
Why are you doing this, huh?

278
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.729
Ha, ha!

279
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:23.250
You know what even
this piece of shit


280
00:33:23.284 --> 00:33:24.596
doesn't deserve to be punched.

281
00:33:26.322 --> 00:33:27.668
You little fuck!

282
00:33:30.843 --> 00:33:33.329
How you feeling
now asshole, huh?


283
00:33:40.784 --> 00:33:44.754
I wanna see his dick.

284
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:47.549
What?

285
00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:51.209
Yeah, I wanna.

286
00:33:53.763 --> 00:33:56.904
I wanna see his dick.

287
00:34:09.917 --> 00:34:12.678
Shit.

288
00:34:12.713 --> 00:34:13.713
Oh, shit.

289
00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:16.579
You know what, here.

290
00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:17.856
Take a look at mine.

291
00:34:28.453 --> 00:34:30.351
Alright,
that's enough!


292
00:34:57.827 --> 00:34:59.725
I want your PIN number.

293
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.694
I'm gonna remove the tape,

294
00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:06.939
and you're gonna tell me your
PIN number, you understand?


295
00:35:13.532 --> 00:35:15.372
My patience are
running thin with you.


296
00:35:15.396 --> 00:35:16.570
What's that fucking PIN?

297
00:35:16.604 --> 00:35:17.605
Take it easy.

298
00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:26.476
You gonna behave and
tell me your PIN number?


299
00:35:42.906 --> 00:35:43.906
So,

300
00:35:46.462 --> 00:35:47.773
what is the PIN number?

301
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:55.505
What do you want from me?

302
00:35:56.541 --> 00:35:58.508
This is a felony, you know that.

303
00:36:01.546 --> 00:36:03.582
Let me go, and I
won't press charges.


304
00:36:03.617 --> 00:36:08.587
What is the
fucking PIN number?


305
00:36:15.629 --> 00:36:16.940
69-11-69.

306
00:36:56.532 --> 00:36:58.154
You
waiting for someone?


307
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.859
You're sleeping with my wife?

308
00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:21.695
No, I'm not.

309
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.701
Hey!

310
00:37:28.978 --> 00:37:30.566
He's figured out who I am.

311
00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:33.948
And now I want the truth.

312
00:37:39.678 --> 00:37:41.680
Are you fucking my wife?

313
00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:52.277
Grab his head.

314
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:54.037
What?

315
00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:55.004
Grab his head!

316
00:37:55.038 --> 00:37:56.038
What?

317
00:37:58.663 --> 00:37:59.767
No, no, no, no!

318
00:37:59.802 --> 00:38:01.528
No, no!

319
00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:06.981
No!

320
00:38:07.016 --> 00:38:08.569
Stop it, stop it!

321
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:10.813
Stop, stop, stop!

322
00:38:10.847 --> 00:38:11.745
No!

323
00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:13.229
Alright, that's enough!

324
00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:16.681
- We agreed.
- It's answers first.


325
00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:28.831
Are you fucking my wife?

326
00:38:39.773 --> 00:38:41.671
He thinks we're assholes.

327
00:38:41.706 --> 00:38:42.845
I say we fuck him up.

328
00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:44.053
What are we waiting for?

329
00:38:44.087 --> 00:38:47.159
Are you sleeping with my wife?

330
00:38:55.064 --> 00:38:56.064
No.

331
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.100
I'm a therapist.

332
00:39:05.246 --> 00:39:07.283
I feel we have danced like this

333
00:39:07.317 --> 00:39:09.181
a thousand lifetimes before.

334
00:39:13.738 --> 00:39:14.877
Fucking liar!

335
00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:16.810
I am not gonna have
this smug little prick


336
00:39:16.844 --> 00:39:18.294
play fucking mind games with me.

337
00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:21.746
I'm a therapist.

338
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.161
I'm treating her.

339
00:39:23.195 --> 00:39:24.195
For what?

340
00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:27.648
We are bound by
patient-client confidentiality.


341
00:39:27.683 --> 00:39:30.582
Well, right now you're
bound by duct tape, asshole.


342
00:39:34.793 --> 00:39:36.312
I treat people
who have problem:


343
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:38.210
mental problems,

344
00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:40.730
physical problems,

345
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:43.768
spiritual problems.

346
00:39:43.802 --> 00:39:46.149
We know all about your
fucking little immigrant hustle.


347
00:39:46.184 --> 00:39:47.288
You're an escort.

348
00:39:47.323 --> 00:39:49.290
I say we fuck him up.

349
00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:51.776
No, I am a therapist.

350
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:56.159
In a rented apartment in the
middle of the fucking night?


351
00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:57.195
In your car?

352
00:40:02.752 --> 00:40:05.893
Yeah, he's all
fucking class, this guy.


353
00:40:15.144 --> 00:40:16.144
I can explain.

354
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.806
I treat them.

355
00:40:24.187 --> 00:40:25.637
I treat all your wives.

356
00:40:27.777 --> 00:40:28.916
Lizzy Hanson,

357
00:40:30.124 --> 00:40:31.124
Esther Jarret,

358
00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:34.094
Susie Ellis.

359
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:37.200
Check in my pants
you will see my ID.


360
00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:41.929
I'm legally licensed.

361
00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:52.768
Holy shit
he's not lying.


362
00:40:53.907 --> 00:40:56.461
So, you're a licensed
therapist who fucks his clients?


363
00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:59.257
No, I help them
with their problems.


364
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:00.914
Are you listening to this?

365
00:41:00.948 --> 00:41:02.339
Where do you get your
fucking balls big enough?


366
00:41:02.363 --> 00:41:04.193
You see the clothes
this guy has on?


367
00:41:04.227 --> 00:41:05.815
Look at that shirt he's wearing.

368
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.783
How much of my money
paid for that shirt?


369
00:41:07.817 --> 00:41:09.267
How much?
- Alright, calm down.


370
00:41:10.717 --> 00:41:12.995
How much do they pay
for your treatments?


371
00:41:13.029 --> 00:41:14.444
Depends on their problems.

372
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.000
Each case is different.

373
00:41:18.034 --> 00:41:19.864
How much did my wife pay?

374
00:41:19.898 --> 00:41:21.072
Per hour!

375
00:41:21.106 --> 00:41:23.833
Admit it you fucked
my little Susie, didn't you?


376
00:41:23.868 --> 00:41:26.456
Satisfaction guaranteed
or your money back.


377
00:41:26.491 --> 00:41:28.320
How much did she pay you?

378
00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:35.155
$275 an hour.

379
00:41:35.189 --> 00:41:36.846
What?

380
00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:38.848
$275 per hour?

381
00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:42.231
Does she owe you money?

382
00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:43.439
No, she doesn't.

383
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.383
Do you know
how much fucking money?


384
00:41:46.407 --> 00:41:47.857
Do you know how
much money I make?


385
00:41:54.277 --> 00:41:56.935
How long have you
slept with Susie?


386
00:41:58.005 --> 00:42:01.871
Like I said I treat her.

387
00:42:01.906 --> 00:42:03.079
How long?

388
00:42:03.114 --> 00:42:04.115
Answer him!

389
00:42:05.806 --> 00:42:06.876
About five months.

390
00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:09.879
And Lizzy?

391
00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:10.914
Maybe six.

392
00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:15.954
How did it all start?

393
00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:17.749
Through referrals.

394
00:42:17.784 --> 00:42:18.957
- Referrals?
- Referrals?


395
00:42:18.992 --> 00:42:19.924
What?

396
00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:20.821
Yeah, I'm a therapist.

397
00:42:20.856 --> 00:42:21.960
I have a business.

398
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.549
I have a list of
private clients.


399
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:26.137
I'm very selective.

400
00:42:26.171 --> 00:42:28.967
So, who referred Susie?

401
00:42:29.002 --> 00:42:31.970
I said I cannot tell you.

402
00:42:33.213 --> 00:42:35.318
So, it's just a business.

403
00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:36.803
You pay taxes.

404
00:42:36.837 --> 00:42:38.839
You provide insurance?

405
00:42:38.874 --> 00:42:40.151
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

406
00:42:43.154 --> 00:42:44.880
I'm just there to save them.

407
00:42:44.914 --> 00:42:45.915
Save them?

408
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.537
Yes, save them
from themselves.


409
00:42:47.572 --> 00:42:49.954
You just manipulate
women, don't you?


410
00:42:54.027 --> 00:42:55.235
I am not the bad guy here.

411
00:42:56.167 --> 00:42:57.306
So, who is?

412
00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:00.067
You tell me, I mean.

413
00:43:00.102 --> 00:43:01.793
Don't you get smart with me.

414
00:43:02.932 --> 00:43:06.591
Then why did she pay you?

415
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:07.454
You don't wanna know.

416
00:43:07.488 --> 00:43:09.042
- Why?
- Answer him!


417
00:43:09.076 --> 00:43:10.146
Fucking answer him!

418
00:43:12.183 --> 00:43:14.150
Why do you think
she comes to see me?


419
00:43:15.945 --> 00:43:18.327
Why do you think all your
wives come to see me?


420
00:43:22.055 --> 00:43:23.263
You better be careful.

421
00:43:25.092 --> 00:43:30.097
I wanna know why Lizzy lied
about bridge night on Tuesday


422
00:43:31.029 --> 00:43:32.309
and girls' night
out on Thursday.


423
00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:35.896
I'm gonna find out,

424
00:43:39.072 --> 00:43:41.212
and if I don't get a
satisfactory answer,


425
00:43:41.246 --> 00:43:43.352
we are gonna fuck
this bastard up.


426
00:44:00.196 --> 00:44:03.199
Listen, they trust me,
and I'm just there for them.


427
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.271
They want to talk,

428
00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:11.311
and I listen to understand
them to help them,


429
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.867
to help them become wives again,

430
00:44:17.317 --> 00:44:20.216
to help them become
better women.


431
00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:24.565
How dare you sit there and
talk about my woman like that?


432
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.015
You don't know her.

433
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.192
"My woman," you see
that's the problem.


434
00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:33.057
She is someone's
daughter or sister.


435
00:44:34.161 --> 00:44:37.026
My wife she's not a thing.

436
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:40.029
She's not a piece of meat.

437
00:44:40.064 --> 00:44:42.169
There are a few
things she deserves.


438
00:44:43.412 --> 00:44:45.414
She wants to be respected.

439
00:44:45.448 --> 00:44:48.141
She wants to be loved.

440
00:44:48.175 --> 00:44:52.076
So, you make 'em feel loved.

441
00:44:53.353 --> 00:44:55.079
Make 'em feel wanted?

442
00:44:55.113 --> 00:44:57.357
You see, we connect.

443
00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.980
We talk.

444
00:45:00.015 --> 00:45:00.705
We sit.

445
00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:01.739
We watch TV.

446
00:45:03.052 --> 00:45:06.193
Sometimes I read to them
and they fall asleep.


447
00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:10.957
I give them what
they're missing.


448
00:45:23.693 --> 00:45:25.281
It's not about sex.

449
00:45:27.352 --> 00:45:30.148
Well, then what are
you talking about,


450
00:45:30.183 --> 00:45:33.117
fucking respect, making
them feel special?


451
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:35.602
I'm not here to
break your marriages.


452
00:45:35.636 --> 00:45:37.742
I'm actually helping them.

453
00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:39.226
I should cut your cock off.

454
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.171
Then we'd see how you'd
be there to help them.


455
00:45:42.195 --> 00:45:44.197
I am happily married myself.

456
00:45:44.231 --> 00:45:46.751
Married you're a fucking liar.

457
00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:49.961
Look at my phone
I have pictures.


458
00:45:49.996 --> 00:45:54.310
69-11-69.

459
00:45:54.345 --> 00:45:55.967
I even have a
beautiful daughter.


460
00:45:56.002 --> 00:45:58.038
You're all a drain on society.

461
00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:03.285
So, how does your wife
feel about what you do?


462
00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:07.599
She understand that
I'm helping people.


463
00:46:07.634 --> 00:46:09.291
It's not personal.

464
00:46:09.325 --> 00:46:11.258
Oh, hold on.

465
00:46:11.293 --> 00:46:12.535
Let me get this straight.

466
00:46:13.433 --> 00:46:16.677
You fuck my wife and I pay you,

467
00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:18.438
and it's not personal.

468
00:46:18.472 --> 00:46:20.267
I'm simply feeding my family.

469
00:46:20.302 --> 00:46:24.478
Oh, you know, I'd feed her.

470
00:46:24.513 --> 00:46:26.618
Yeah, she's not bad.

471
00:46:26.653 --> 00:46:29.552
Actually, you know what
I'd fuck her.


472
00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:30.795
How would you like that?

473
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.629
How would you like if
I'd fuck your wife, huh?


474
00:46:33.694 --> 00:46:35.627
I'd give her the
ride of her life.


475
00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:40.046
Susie was right about you.

476
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.495
What did you say?

477
00:46:42.703 --> 00:46:46.052
I said that Susie
was right about you.


478
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:49.227
Why do you think
she comes to see me?


479
00:46:50.642 --> 00:46:52.196
Because you sleep with her.

480
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.230
No, wrong answer.

481
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.200
Why?

482
00:46:56.234 --> 00:46:59.099
Because I work
hard and I work late?


483
00:47:00.066 --> 00:47:01.066
No.

484
00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:02.653
Then why?

485
00:47:04.484 --> 00:47:06.072
Because you are in denial.

486
00:47:09.247 --> 00:47:11.146
You're losing your business.

487
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.113
Close to bankruptcy.
- Shut up!


488
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.220
You can't repay
your creditors.


489
00:47:19.706 --> 00:47:21.294
You're one of his
creditors, right?


490
00:47:21.328 --> 00:47:22.778
I said shut up.

491
00:47:22.812 --> 00:47:24.228
Unless you know about this.

492
00:47:30.234 --> 00:47:31.304
You know what

493
00:47:33.513 --> 00:47:35.239
you have no backbone.

494
00:47:40.416 --> 00:47:41.762
You are gutless.

495
00:47:43.316 --> 00:47:44.662
It's okay.

496
00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:48.252
- You're yella!
- I said shut the fuck up.


497
00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:51.634
Fucking my wife.

498
00:47:53.222 --> 00:47:54.741
Giving her the ride of her life.

499
00:47:56.225 --> 00:47:57.330
How you gonna do that?

500
00:47:59.573 --> 00:48:00.816
You can't even get it up.

501
00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:06.201
You're impotent.

502
00:48:11.344 --> 00:48:13.208
She called you Viagra.

503
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:15.727
Get it?

504
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:17.281
Can't get it up?

505
00:48:21.457 --> 00:48:23.356
The thing is your
wife needs sex.


506
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.704
She's not had sex for years.

507
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.210
Well, good morning, sunshine.

508
00:48:50.245 --> 00:48:51.660
Tell me about my money.

509
00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:56.251
Go get that hammer.

510
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:58.736
You can still let me go.

511
00:49:00.358 --> 00:49:02.671
I'm not gonna say
anything to the police.


512
00:49:02.705 --> 00:49:04.328
No one needs to know.

513
00:49:04.362 --> 00:49:06.226
Tell me what you and Lizzy

514
00:49:06.261 --> 00:49:08.228
were planning to
do with my money.


515
00:49:08.263 --> 00:49:09.747
I said go get that hammer!

516
00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:18.204
If you tell me about the
money, I can make this stop.


517
00:49:18.238 --> 00:49:19.238
It's up to you.

518
00:49:20.723 --> 00:49:22.277
No, no!

519
00:49:24.313 --> 00:49:25.497
What are you doing?
- I'm gonna enjoy this


520
00:49:25.521 --> 00:49:26.981
more than you enjoyed
fucking my wife.


521
00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:28.559
Where's that hammer?

522
00:49:28.593 --> 00:49:30.595
Get it in here.

523
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.287
To that hands.
- No, don't do this.


524
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:33.529
Give it to him!

525
00:49:33.564 --> 00:49:35.911
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!


526
00:49:35.945 --> 00:49:37.509
- Give it to him!
- No, no, don't do this!


527
00:49:37.533 --> 00:49:39.339
No, don't do it, don't do it!
- Give it to him!


528
00:49:39.363 --> 00:49:41.330
- You are not like him.
- Give it to him!


529
00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:42.435
You're better than him.

530
00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:43.515
Come on, you pussy!

531
00:49:43.539 --> 00:49:44.609
You know it.

532
00:49:44.644 --> 00:49:46.232
Don't, don't!

533
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.372
No, don't it.
- Do it!


534
00:49:48.406 --> 00:49:49.476
Do it!

535
00:49:51.306 --> 00:49:52.997
- You are not like him!
- Shit.


536
00:50:05.492 --> 00:50:07.322
Hey, you alright?

537
00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:11.464
I'm sorry, I just...

538
00:50:11.498 --> 00:50:12.913
I couldn't.

539
00:50:12.948 --> 00:50:14.305
It's alright, it's alright
don't worry about it.


540
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:15.651
We just gotta get
back inside let's go.


541
00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:17.504
No, I can't do this.

542
00:50:19.368 --> 00:50:20.473
I'm sorry.

543
00:50:20.507 --> 00:50:23.027
No, listen we all agreed.

544
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:25.478
We agreed we were gonna
strip him, beat him,


545
00:50:25.512 --> 00:50:27.687
throw him in the grave to
scare the shit out of him,


546
00:50:27.721 --> 00:50:29.699
you know and then send him
home with a final warning,


547
00:50:29.723 --> 00:50:31.242
but not this.

548
00:50:31.277 --> 00:50:32.588
I know, I know.

549
00:50:32.623 --> 00:50:33.865
This is way out of hand.

550
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.453
I know Jarret's
out of control.


551
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.978
I know, you know that I know.

552
00:50:49.018 --> 00:50:50.296
I don't like you.

553
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.266
Listen, I'm sorry
about the business.


554
00:50:55.301 --> 00:50:56.864
I was gonna tell you I
just didn't know how.


555
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:58.107
I don't give a shit
about the business.


556
00:50:58.131 --> 00:51:02.342
No, I was trying to fix it,
but then I just it got worse.


557
00:51:02.377 --> 00:51:03.999
I'm fucked.

558
00:51:04.033 --> 00:51:04.931
I fucked up.

559
00:51:04.965 --> 00:51:07.451
I understand, it's okay.

560
00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:09.349
But I swear to you,
you're gonna get paid.


561
00:51:09.384 --> 00:51:10.661
Everyone's gonna get paid.

562
00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:12.397
I'm gonna pay you back.
- It's okay, listen.


563
00:51:12.421 --> 00:51:13.605
Everybody is
gonna get paid back!


564
00:51:13.629 --> 00:51:14.941
I've already taken care of it!

565
00:51:14.975 --> 00:51:15.975
Do you understand?

566
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:21.465
What do you mean?

567
00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:28.575
What do you mean you've
taken care of it?


568
00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.478
You're not taking my business.

569
00:51:34.512 --> 00:51:36.307
Lizzy's gonna be
here any second.


570
00:51:36.342 --> 00:51:38.378
Come on, let's go.
- No, I'm not going back!


571
00:51:38.413 --> 00:51:40.587
Okay, then get out
of here, alright, go!


572
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:49.700
This night he said he
was ready not to report it.


573
00:51:49.734 --> 00:51:51.115
We can all walk away from this.

574
00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.289
I'm gonna handle it, okay?

575
00:51:52.323 --> 00:51:54.601
I'm gonna fucking handle it
like I handled everything.


576
00:51:57.052 --> 00:51:58.709
Now get out of here!

577
00:52:00.435 --> 00:52:02.471
I'm telling you, you're
not taking my business.


578
00:52:02.506 --> 00:52:04.611
Over the fence
same way you came in.


579
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:07.590
You're not taking my business.

580
00:52:07.614 --> 00:52:08.822
Don't let 'em see you.

581
00:52:13.758 --> 00:52:15.035
Don't you dare, don't!

582
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:16.105
No, no!
- Oh yeah!


583
00:52:48.483 --> 00:52:49.415
No!

584
00:52:52.107 --> 00:52:53.107
Stop!

585
00:52:54.627 --> 00:52:55.627
Enough!

586
00:52:57.457 --> 00:52:58.457
Fuck!

587
00:52:59.425 --> 00:53:00.080
He had it coming.

588
00:53:00.115 --> 00:53:01.185
Look, we agreed.

589
00:53:01.219 --> 00:53:02.749
We're gonna humiliate him,
scare him a little bit


590
00:53:02.773 --> 00:53:03.774
and then cut him loose.

591
00:53:06.604 --> 00:53:07.916
- Where's Ellis?
- He's gone.


592
00:53:08.951 --> 00:53:10.470
That fucking coward.

593
00:53:13.439 --> 00:53:14.726
What is it with you
and these questions?


594
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:17.512
He's got answers I want 'em!

595
00:53:23.759 --> 00:53:25.727
Lizzy's gonna
be here at 11:30.


596
00:53:25.761 --> 00:53:27.522
- That's right.
- Yeah.


597
00:53:27.556 --> 00:53:29.144
I feel sorry for her.

598
00:53:29.178 --> 00:53:32.527
What the fuck are you
mumbling about, huh?


599
00:53:32.561 --> 00:53:34.736
I feel sorry for Esther.

600
00:53:37.117 --> 00:53:39.119
She used to pay me
just to cry over you.


601
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:45.160
That psychoanalysis
bullshit don't work with me.


602
00:53:45.194 --> 00:53:47.507
Why you don't wanna
hear about the truth?


603
00:53:49.544 --> 00:53:50.579
About her secrets?

604
00:53:51.684 --> 00:53:52.684
Jamie Jarret.

605
00:53:54.134 --> 00:53:55.929
You think the entire
world owes you.


606
00:53:56.792 --> 00:53:57.966
That's not true.

607
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.831
Nobody gives a fuck,
and that's killing you.


608
00:54:02.557 --> 00:54:05.594
That's why you drink,
you fucking drunk!


609
00:54:10.496 --> 00:54:11.738
Oh, boy.

610
00:54:12.946 --> 00:54:14.603
- Watch your head.
- Okay, okay, okay.


611
00:54:14.638 --> 00:54:16.571
Thank you, thank you.

612
00:54:19.677 --> 00:54:21.645
Come on, for Christ
sakes where's my dinner?


613
00:54:21.679 --> 00:54:23.232
I asked for it,
like, 10 minutes ago!


614
00:54:23.267 --> 00:54:26.097
- It's coming, it's coming.
- Yeah, well come on please!


615
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.652
Just what the?

616
00:54:28.686 --> 00:54:30.861
Clean that up!

617
00:54:30.895 --> 00:54:33.726
You bring salad to the table
that's got no dressing on it!


618
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.141
Clean it up!

619
00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:37.937
You know, I feel bad for her.

620
00:54:37.971 --> 00:54:42.079
I feel bad for your sister
'cause she loves him.


621
00:54:42.113 --> 00:54:45.185
What the fuck have you
been doing all day, huh?


622
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.774
What the fuck have you
been doing all day?


623
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:49.914
Get me another beer, now!

624
00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.020
She loves you,

625
00:54:57.266 --> 00:54:58.578
and that's killing her.

626
00:55:15.008 --> 00:55:20.013
The truth is without
her you you're nothing.


627
00:55:21.567 --> 00:55:24.570
Just fucking lost, you fucking
moron, and you know it.


628
00:55:26.157 --> 00:55:28.643
You just keep
talking shit, boy.


629
00:55:28.677 --> 00:55:31.162
I'm gonna knock that
fucking smile off your face.


630
00:55:31.197 --> 00:55:32.197
Oh, yeah?

631
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:35.822
What about the headaches, huh?

632
00:55:35.857 --> 00:55:37.583
Let's talk about the headaches.

633
00:55:53.944 --> 00:55:55.842
Wait a minute.

634
00:55:55.877 --> 00:55:57.568
What about her headaches?

635
00:55:57.603 --> 00:55:59.926
Why do you think she goes in
the hospital every week, huh?


636
00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.331
Why do you think, what
causes the imbalance?


637
00:56:02.366 --> 00:56:03.654
What the fuck is
he talking about?


638
00:56:03.678 --> 00:56:05.369
How can you do
that to a woman?


639
00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:06.898
Your sister what are
you gonna do about it?


640
00:56:06.922 --> 00:56:08.165
Shut your lying filthy!

641
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.097
Why
would you do that?


642
00:56:09.131 --> 00:56:10.270
Why would you do that?

643
00:56:11.962 --> 00:56:14.033
Stop, you're gonna kill him!

644
00:56:14.067 --> 00:56:15.344
You'll kill him!

645
00:56:15.379 --> 00:56:16.379
Stop!

646
00:56:18.762 --> 00:56:20.073
Fuck him!

647
00:56:25.941 --> 00:56:27.598
He's been beating your sister.

648
00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:29.220
- This is it!
- No, I'm sorry!


649
00:56:29.255 --> 00:56:31.671
No, I'm sorry!
- This is how rude!


650
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.898
Is that true?

651
00:56:53.072 --> 00:56:55.695
Yeah, I have
pictures on my phone.


652
00:56:56.385 --> 00:56:59.354
69-11-69.

653
00:56:59.388 --> 00:57:01.356
He's a fucking liar.

654
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:02.840
You've been beating Esther?

655
00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:05.809
- He's lying!
- You marinate yourself


656
00:57:05.843 --> 00:57:07.707
in vodka and you beat my sister!

657
00:57:07.742 --> 00:57:08.857
Fuck you, Richie, what
have you ever done for me?


658
00:57:08.881 --> 00:57:10.261
Are you fucking kidding me?

659
00:57:10.296 --> 00:57:11.884
I've been carrying
you for years.


660
00:57:11.918 --> 00:57:14.058
Oh, you employ me
so now you own me?


661
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:19.926
All she does is take care
of you and you beat her?


662
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:21.894
You abuse her like a punk?

663
00:57:23.136 --> 00:57:24.136
Fuck you!

664
00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:50.750
Fuck.

665
00:57:50.785 --> 00:57:51.820
Fuck.

666
00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:57.377
I never hit her.
- Ah.


667
00:57:59.069 --> 00:58:00.069
She's dying.

668
00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.939
She's dying from a brain tumor.

669
00:58:11.944 --> 00:58:13.842
She wanted you to be
the last one to know.


670
00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:17.328
She wanted you to feel guilty,

671
00:58:18.502 --> 00:58:23.300
to feel pain the way
she's felt for years,


672
00:58:24.025 --> 00:58:25.025
every single day.

673
00:58:30.928 --> 00:58:31.928
Dead.

674
00:58:34.035 --> 00:58:35.899
Dead but smiling,

675
00:58:41.042 --> 00:58:46.047
because then she'll be free.

676
00:58:55.021 --> 00:58:56.229
Esther's dying?

677
00:59:09.104 --> 00:59:12.107
You ever touch my sister
again and I'll kill you.


678
00:59:12.142 --> 00:59:13.315
You understand me?

679
00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.490
What you're gonna
take his word over mine?


680
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.320
Do you want me to look?

681
00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:20.012
You said family
should stick together.


682
00:59:20.046 --> 00:59:21.841
You're not my family.

683
00:59:21.876 --> 00:59:24.016
You don't work for
me you're fired.


684
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.466
This is over get the
fuck out of here.


685
00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:37.512
You know what,
Richie, fuck you.


686
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:30.391
I'm sorry.

687
01:00:31.635 --> 01:00:33.948
We never should've
done this to you,


688
01:00:33.982 --> 01:00:34.982
and that's my fault.

689
01:00:38.297 --> 01:00:42.957
So, how about I
just cut you loose,


690
01:00:42.991 --> 01:00:45.235
and we forget this whole
thing ever happened?


691
01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:51.516
Okay.

692
01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:33.214
My fingers are broken.

693
01:01:33.248 --> 01:01:34.294
I'll take you to the hospital.

694
01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:35.318
I'll pay for it.

695
01:01:39.185 --> 01:01:40.185
Here.

696
01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:45.501
It's okay.

697
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:50.621
I wouldn't
blame you if you wanted


698
01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:52.026
to press charges.

699
01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:07.696
Press charges against who?

700
01:02:09.146 --> 01:02:10.458
You guys or your wife, Lizzy?

701
01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:12.459
My wife?

702
01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:14.392
Yeah.

703
01:02:16.188 --> 01:02:17.188
She scares me.

704
01:02:17.741 --> 01:02:19.363
She scares you?

705
01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:21.676
All my other clients
understand that


706
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.230
I have a family, a wife
and a beautiful daughter.


707
01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:29.201
But Lizzy she would
not leave me alone.


708
01:02:31.065 --> 01:02:32.169
That scares me.

709
01:02:33.274 --> 01:02:34.620
You're sleeping with my wife,

710
01:02:34.654 --> 01:02:35.966
and my wife scares you?

711
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.037
I have not slept
with your wife.


712
01:02:38.072 --> 01:02:39.245
Don't bullshit me!

713
01:02:41.213 --> 01:02:43.560
I have never slept
with your wife.


714
01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:47.253
All that is just a
big misunderstanding.


715
01:02:54.088 --> 01:02:57.125
Your wife she will
not leave me alone.


716
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.264
She calls me all the time,

717
01:03:01.095 --> 01:03:05.444
calling me, calling
my cell, my house.


718
01:03:05.478 --> 01:03:09.068
She even call me sometimes
when she's in bed with you.


719
01:03:09.103 --> 01:03:10.356
I've known my
wife for five years.


720
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.795
We've been married for four.

721
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:15.557
You do not know
your wife, believe me.


722
01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:17.076
The other day she
sent me a video


723
01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:19.527
of my wife shopping with my kid.

724
01:03:28.225 --> 01:03:30.193
How does she know my wife, huh?

725
01:03:35.267 --> 01:03:37.131
Maybe you're
telling the truth,


726
01:03:37.165 --> 01:03:40.099
but maybe you're not and
maybe you deserve this.


727
01:03:40.134 --> 01:03:41.480
Maybe this is karma.

728
01:03:57.185 --> 01:03:58.704
Do you know your
wife has a gun?


729
01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:01.878
- A gun?
- Yeah.


730
01:04:06.263 --> 01:04:08.231
She says she will kill me.

731
01:04:10.164 --> 01:04:11.165
She will kill my family,

732
01:04:12.373 --> 01:04:13.581
and then she'll kill herself.

733
01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:14.858
This is bullshit!

734
01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:16.284
You're telling me I
don't know my wife?


735
01:04:16.308 --> 01:04:17.240
I don't think you
do know your wife.


736
01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:19.794
You have to understand that.

737
01:04:19.828 --> 01:04:21.727
She's not who you think she is.

738
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.350
Your wife is...

739
01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:27.594
For me she's crazy.

740
01:04:29.528 --> 01:04:30.839
Please check yourself.

741
01:04:58.384 --> 01:04:59.627
You're right.

742
01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:06.530
I don't know my wife Lizzy.

743
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:11.225
Lizzy doesn't love me anymore.

744
01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:17.369
All I ever wanted was to
have a child with her.


745
01:05:22.443 --> 01:05:26.309
I think you need to
hear her for yourself.


746
01:05:30.278 --> 01:05:32.246
You need to understand
what's going on.


747
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.629
Why don't you go to the
closet, wait for her to come,


748
01:05:40.219 --> 01:05:43.878
then you'll hear and
then you will understand.


749
01:05:55.614 --> 01:05:56.614
Karma.

750
01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.756
That's Her Majesty.

751
01:06:01.896 --> 01:06:02.896
Answer it.

752
01:06:05.727 --> 01:06:06.727
On speaker.

753
01:06:11.354 --> 01:06:12.458
Hi.

754
01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:15.496
Are you there?
- Hi.


755
01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:17.750
Is there a problem?

756
01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:19.879
No, all is well here.

757
01:06:19.914 --> 01:06:21.295
Waiting for you.

758
01:06:21.329 --> 01:06:22.296
Okay.

759
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.642
How long before you get here?

760
01:06:23.676 --> 01:06:24.919
Five to 10 minutes.

761
01:06:24.953 --> 01:06:28.474
Okay, five to 10
minutes I'll be here.


762
01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:31.443
I'll be there soon.

763
01:06:31.477 --> 01:06:32.477
See you shortly.

764
01:06:38.622 --> 01:06:42.316
And also, I know
about the money.


765
01:06:44.766 --> 01:06:48.839
There's something she's going
to do regarding your business.


766
01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:50.324
What, what is she planning?

767
01:06:51.773 --> 01:06:55.363
It's not very clear, but
I'm sure I can find out.


768
01:06:58.332 --> 01:07:00.299
How do I know
this isn't a setup?


769
01:07:36.749 --> 01:07:37.819
Oh, my god.

770
01:07:40.028 --> 01:07:41.028
Oh, my god.

771
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.068
Oh, my god.
- Watch out.


772
01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.069
Fuck, what happened to you?

773
01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:47.312
I'm okay.

774
01:07:47.346 --> 01:07:48.520
What happened to you god?

775
01:07:49.693 --> 01:07:52.006
I was attacked by a
bunch of drunk guys.


776
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.527
Oh, sweetheart, you okay?

777
01:07:55.561 --> 01:07:56.873
Are you okay?

778
01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.426
Yeah, I'm okay.

779
01:08:00.463 --> 01:08:02.810
I'm never gonna let
anybody hurt you, sweetheart.


780
01:08:02.844 --> 01:08:06.917
I know.

781
01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:08.333
Are you okay?

782
01:08:08.367 --> 01:08:10.369
Yeah, can you get
me some water please?


783
01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.397
I'm never gonna
let anybody hurt you.


784
01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:40.744
Oh, my god.

785
01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:42.367
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

786
01:08:44.472 --> 01:08:45.611
It's okay.

787
01:08:45.646 --> 01:08:46.646
It's okay.

788
01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:51.616
I love you.

789
01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:54.170
I love you.

790
01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.694
Do you remember
the beautiful day


791
01:09:00.902 --> 01:09:03.008
at the beach, beautiful sunset?

792
01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:07.530
Dance with me.

793
01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:08.600
Yeah.

794
01:09:10.153 --> 01:09:14.433
Dance like we have danced
a thousand lifetimes.


795
01:09:14.468 --> 01:09:15.986
Yeah, that's it.

796
01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:21.544
Oh, sweetheart.

797
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.344
Sweetheart.

798
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.868
In all my dreams,

799
01:09:40.425 --> 01:09:43.842
I never imagined that
this day would come.


800
01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:46.500
I mean you and me right here,

801
01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:51.056
right now, just like this.

802
01:09:56.648 --> 01:09:57.959
You fixed me.

803
01:09:59.547 --> 01:10:00.547
You made me strong.

804
01:10:03.448 --> 01:10:06.520
You put me back together again.

805
01:10:06.554 --> 01:10:07.659
You saved me.

806
01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:09.661
You saved me.

807
01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:11.732
You fixed my heart.

808
01:10:13.975 --> 01:10:14.975
I know it.

809
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:19.567
You know, now it's our time.

810
01:10:26.678 --> 01:10:27.506
You know what?

811
01:10:35.687 --> 01:10:37.413
Look, look at this.

812
01:10:39.794 --> 01:10:40.794
I got it.

813
01:10:42.072 --> 01:10:44.212
It's everything.

814
01:10:44.247 --> 01:10:46.525
It's everything that we need

815
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.702
for the house in
Thailand to get set up.


816
01:10:50.736 --> 01:10:53.877
Everything we need for
a new life together.


817
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.810
It's just you and me.

818
01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:01.747
We've got it!

819
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.963
I can't do this
anymore, I can't.


820
01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:12.240
- Huh?
- Listen.


821
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.763
I just can't do this anymore.

822
01:11:19.627 --> 01:11:20.559
Listen.

823
01:11:20.594 --> 01:11:21.802
What?

824
01:11:21.836 --> 01:11:23.156
I'm never gonna
leave my family.


825
01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:27.601
This is a beautiful dream,

826
01:11:27.635 --> 01:11:30.604
but let's get back to reality.

827
01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:34.711
I'm sorry I don't
understand what you're saying.


828
01:11:34.746 --> 01:11:39.578
That story of soulmates
and all that crap.


829
01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:44.687
I think your imagination
just went wild.


830
01:11:44.721 --> 01:11:46.516
What about your wrist?

831
01:11:48.829 --> 01:11:51.107
Lizzy, I was
just doing my job.


832
01:11:52.764 --> 01:11:53.799
I don't understand.

833
01:11:55.905 --> 01:11:59.011
So, you don't wanna be with me?

834
01:12:05.328 --> 01:12:07.779
You said that you loved me.

835
01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:11.921
You said that you wanted
to be with me forever.


836
01:12:17.651 --> 01:12:19.687
I was just doing
my job, alright?


837
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:23.139
I was doing my job.

838
01:12:48.682 --> 01:12:49.682
Lizzy.

839
01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:53.721
Get off of me!

840
01:12:54.998 --> 01:12:55.998
Get off!

841
01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:01.764
- Lizzy.
- Go away from me!


842
01:13:01.798 --> 01:13:03.800
Please stop it
don't do that again.


843
01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:06.078
What the fuck are
you talking about?


844
01:13:06.113 --> 01:13:07.113
Go away!

845
01:13:09.806 --> 01:13:10.921
- You're scaring me.
- What the fuck


846
01:13:10.945 --> 01:13:12.153
is your problem?

847
01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:14.397
- You are scaring me.
- What about soulmates?


848
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:16.157
What about our parents?

849
01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:17.814
What about our parents?

850
01:13:17.849 --> 01:13:22.681
You said that our parents
both died to same way!


851
01:13:22.716 --> 01:13:23.855
You said that!

852
01:13:23.889 --> 01:13:25.132
Is that true?

853
01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.754
Is that true?

854
01:13:26.789 --> 01:13:28.376
Is that true?

855
01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:29.308
No.

856
01:13:29.343 --> 01:13:31.241
You said we were soulmates!

857
01:13:31.276 --> 01:13:32.829
What have you done to my life?

858
01:13:32.864 --> 01:13:35.694
You said that we were
fucking soulmates!


859
01:13:35.729 --> 01:13:37.731
What is your problem?

860
01:13:37.765 --> 01:13:39.629
What is your problem?
- Stop, stop.


861
01:13:39.664 --> 01:13:41.907
- What is your problem?
- Stop, don't do that!


862
01:13:41.942 --> 01:13:43.160
- What is your problem?
- Lizzy, don't!


863
01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:45.186
You said that
we were together!


864
01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:46.740
You said that we
were together forever


865
01:13:46.774 --> 01:13:49.777
and you wanted to be with
me forever no matter what!


866
01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:51.237
- What about your husband?
- What do you mean,


867
01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:53.022
what about my husband?

868
01:13:53.056 --> 01:13:53.954
Don't you love him?

869
01:13:53.988 --> 01:13:55.162
What are you talking about?

870
01:13:55.196 --> 01:13:57.060
We've talked about
this a thousand times!


871
01:13:57.095 --> 01:13:59.338
You know what that was about!

872
01:13:59.373 --> 01:14:01.409
What are we about?
- You're gonna break his...


873
01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:02.928
- No!
- He needs you.


874
01:14:02.963 --> 01:14:04.171
You love me!

875
01:14:04.205 --> 01:14:06.656
What are you fucking doing?

876
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:08.071
I don't understand!

877
01:14:08.106 --> 01:14:09.279
It's not about me.

878
01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:10.660
No, it's not.

879
01:14:10.695 --> 01:14:13.318
It's about me now,
and I don't need you.


880
01:14:13.352 --> 01:14:14.802
I don't need you!

881
01:14:14.837 --> 01:14:17.460
I don't need you anymore!

882
01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:18.875
I don't need you!
- You're crazy!


883
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:19.738
I have got everything

884
01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:20.922
that I need!
- Lizzy, you're crazy!


885
01:14:20.946 --> 01:14:21.982
- No!
- I mean, stop it!


886
01:14:22.016 --> 01:14:23.397
- You stop it!
- Stop it!


887
01:14:23.431 --> 01:14:24.892
You're the one
that's fucking crazy.


888
01:14:24.916 --> 01:14:26.296
You're just a fucking hustler.

889
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.850
Oh, it's not about the sex!

890
01:14:27.884 --> 01:14:29.714
It's not about the sex!

891
01:14:29.748 --> 01:14:30.887
Oh, we're just playing.

892
01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:32.233
It is not about the sex.

893
01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:33.096
You're just playing.

894
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:34.788
Oh, yeah, baby.

895
01:14:34.822 --> 01:14:36.479
Oh, yeah, baby.

896
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:38.205
Oh, I'm just here
to help you, baby.


897
01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:41.760
I just want to make everyone
so fucking happy, baby!


898
01:14:41.795 --> 01:14:43.279
You're just a bullshitter!

899
01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:44.970
You're a fucking bullshitter!

900
01:14:51.943 --> 01:14:53.220
Look at me!

901
01:14:53.254 --> 01:14:55.809
You think I'm a fucking fool?

902
01:14:55.843 --> 01:14:57.845
Do you think I'm
a fucking idiot?


903
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.815
Clearly, you have mistook
my kindness for weakness,


904
01:15:01.849 --> 01:15:03.989
but I see right through you!

905
01:15:04.024 --> 01:15:06.474
You told me that you
wanted to have my baby.


906
01:15:06.509 --> 01:15:08.822
You told me to get
rid of his baby.


907
01:15:08.856 --> 01:15:09.857
I did that.

908
01:15:09.892 --> 01:15:11.894
I got rid of his baby for you,

909
01:15:11.928 --> 01:15:14.759
so I could have your baby!

910
01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:16.761
I'm having your baby!

911
01:15:16.795 --> 01:15:18.970
What are you talking about?

912
01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.907
Help me.

913
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:35.631
Help me.

914
01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.980
Help me.

915
01:16:43.848 --> 01:16:46.333
In another lifetime,
Lizzy Hanson,


916
01:16:46.367 --> 01:16:49.060
maybe things will be different.

917
01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:30.964
I can't stop thinking about you.

918
01:17:30.998 --> 01:17:33.104
I know you feel the same.

919
01:17:34.381 --> 01:17:35.520
Come on, admit it.

920
01:17:36.901 --> 01:17:37.763
I can't
leave my husband.


921
01:17:37.798 --> 01:17:40.042
We are
soulmates, Lizzy.


922
01:17:40.076 --> 01:17:41.319
What about Richie?

923
01:17:41.353 --> 01:17:42.952
He doesn't understand,
doesn't connect with you.


924
01:17:42.976 --> 01:17:43.987
- No, stop it.
- I need you.


925
01:17:44.011 --> 01:17:45.357
Just stop it!

926
01:17:45.392 --> 01:17:48.291
We can
be together, Lizzy.


927
01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:50.569
A child with
someone I can connect with.


928
01:17:51.639 --> 01:17:53.434
You're right.
- I love you.


929
01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:55.298
We're soulmates.

930
01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:56.333
I love you.

931
01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.097
We need the gun for
security, for our security.


932
01:18:01.132 --> 01:18:02.443
How did you find me?

933
01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:06.033
You just tell me what
you want I'll do it.


934
01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:10.210
I feel we
have danced like this


935
01:18:10.244 --> 01:18:13.282
a thousand lifetimes before.

936
01:18:13.316 --> 01:18:15.008
That's it.
- Stop it.


937
01:18:15.042 --> 01:18:16.112
That's it.

938
01:18:16.147 --> 01:18:17.424
Oh god, I love you.

939
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:38.065
Hey, darling.

940
01:18:41.413 --> 01:18:45.038
This tooth fairy's on his way
to his daughter with a tooth.


941
01:18:45.072 --> 01:18:46.142
Rough day?

942
01:18:46.177 --> 01:18:47.212
Mm.

943
01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:49.351
Kind of.

944
01:18:50.422 --> 01:18:52.045
Did she bring the money?

945
01:18:52.079 --> 01:18:54.116
Yeah, she brought the money.

946
01:18:56.049 --> 01:18:57.060
On the need of the person.

947
01:18:57.084 --> 01:18:58.672
Whatever you need, you know,

948
01:18:58.706 --> 01:18:59.994
I can provide.
- Thank you so much.


949
01:19:00.018 --> 01:19:02.296
- Thank you.
- I appreciate you.


950
01:19:20.004 --> 01:19:21.522
I think this
one's really good.


951
01:19:23.145 --> 01:19:24.249
Yeah, it could work.

952
01:19:25.492 --> 01:19:29.358
Look at that married 24 years,

953
01:19:29.392 --> 01:19:31.187
He travels.

954
01:19:31.222 --> 01:19:33.362
She spends her days at the club.

955
01:19:36.123 --> 01:19:39.023
- Perfect client.
- Perfect client.


956
01:19:42.543 --> 01:19:44.269
But it's a long story.

957
01:19:44.304 --> 01:19:46.582
I'll have to explain later.

958
01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.618
I had to let her go though.

959
01:19:48.653 --> 01:19:49.653
Don't worry.

960
01:19:50.551 --> 01:19:52.243
I have other
potentials lined up.


961
01:19:53.382 --> 01:19:54.382
Good.

962
01:19:56.247 --> 01:19:57.558
How much longer?

963
01:19:58.387 --> 01:20:01.562
In about half an hour.

964
01:20:05.187 --> 01:20:06.187
I love you.

965
01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:08.431
Love you more.
