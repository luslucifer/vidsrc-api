DEAD EUROPE   English Subs by yavass
April 2013


2
00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:21.893
The racist comments and bigotry expressed
in this film DO NOT represent the beliefs
and ideology of the translator/uploader.


3
00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:45.770
My father got me my first camera

4
00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:53.727
He'd lead me down the streets as if he was
showing me this new country, Australia


5
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.813
...for the first time.

6
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.874
And then I got older......

7
00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:10.757
And he became darker......
drunker.....


8
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.457
My brother Niko couldn't stand it
anymore, so he left


9
00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:33.367
That's when dad retreated into himself,
into the world of his past


10
00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:06.879
My parents got to this country
in bounds.....


11
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:11.087
....and our father made a swear
we'd never go back


12
00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:42.911
Dad, I'll call you a cab...

13
00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.423
Yeah....I love you too !

14
00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.597
Say goodbye to your mother
for me


15
00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:50.112
How did it go ? Is he still angry
about your exhibition ?


16
00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.100
Don't worry about it !
You know how he's like !


17
00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:56.251
I just can't wait to get
on the fucking plane !


18
00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:07.489
You don't have to go.
You know it, don't you ?


19
00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:13.378
Mom, you're kidding me, aren't you ?

20
00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.202
Based on the book by Christos Tsiolkas,
author of "The Slap" and "Loaded-Head On"


21
00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:42.668
Mom, it'll be fine

22
00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:49.750
We have to do it in a church,
with a priest, with prayers.....


23
00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:51.468
No, No ! Why ?

24
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.399
Dad was an atheist, his whole life. He
was a fucking communist, for Christ's sake


25
00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:03.164
An Orthodox church service...is an
insult to everything he believed in


26
00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:07.432
-Mom, he wanted to be cremated !
- No, no ! We don't do that !


27
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.422
We are a Greek family !!
He will have.....


28
00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:16.634
Mom ! I'm taking his ashes
back to Greece !


29
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.314
- The Papigo (=a mountainous village)
- No, no ! You can't go there !


30
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.757
Mom, Isaac is going to Greece anyway...

31
00:07:21.882 --> 00:07:24.520
Let Niko do it.
He's already in Europe !


32
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.016
Right...I left Niko messages.
He's not returning any of them


33
00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:34.375
The blackness...it followed
your father and took him !


34
00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:35.734
Bullshit !

35
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.930
It was an accident !

36
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.781
Don't go !

37
00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:45.550
It'll come for you too !

38
00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:05.857
- Grandma ??
-Yes, sweetheart ?


39
00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:09.038
Is grandpa living in hell
and not with God ?


40
00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:10.838
No darling

41
00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:13.439
Grandpa is in heaven
looking over us


42
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.473
What about Jesus ?

43
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.528
Yeah, he's there too

44
00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:20.362
Funny Jews and Moslems,
they go to hell


45
00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:22.481
Don't listen to her Christos !

46
00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.662
Grandma is just upset, OK ?

47
00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:27.406
We can't say these things to him.
He's a child


48
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:29.562
It's what I believe !!

49
00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:31.608
Well, yeah, but it's poison !

50
00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:34.393
It's pure poison !

51
00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:38.843
Because of the European Union, now
everything goes slowly - slowly


52
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:40.891
The prices go high.....

53
00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:52.277
Athens in the beginning of the 2008-2010
crisis, when the city center collapsed
and was taken over by illegals


54
00:09:52.512 --> 00:09:56.298
Then express your idea the Greek way....

55
00:09:58.228 --> 00:10:00.670
Ôhink in another way
than the others.....


56
00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:48.256
What drives you to take
these photos ?


57
00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:52.779
The Exile-and-the-Return thing
is a bit old-fashioned


58
00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:56.569
Well I suppose a lot of us in Australia
feel we've come from somewhere else


59
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.725
But you were born there.
You grew up there !


60
00:10:58.868 --> 00:11:01.221
Yeah. And I feel like a tourist here

61
00:11:01.257 --> 00:11:03.341
You've never been to Greece before ?

62
00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.347
No one of my family has ever
come back


63
00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:07.548
-You're the first ?
- Yeah


64
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.193
What are you so frightened of ?

65
00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:12.653
Nothing.....

66
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.347
- How are you ?
- Yeah....good !


67
00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:27.018
You're.....by yourself ?

68
00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:39.143
I smoke my first cigerette at your uncle
Paul's house, in Melbourne. Remember ?


69
00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:41.460
That's right !

70
00:11:42.498 --> 00:11:46.503
- You threw up !
-Because the place was disgusting!


71
00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:52.493
None of the rest
of the family came ?

72
00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:55.621
No, they wanted to see you
at home first.


73
00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:58.437
They're really upset about uncle Vasili

74
00:11:58.545 --> 00:12:00.619
He didn't really talk about them
that much


75
00:12:00.767 --> 00:12:02.778
-He didn't huh ?
- No


76
00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.686
-They talk about him ?
- No !


77
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:10.132
I mean...... not often.
Not at all often !


78
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.146
- Weird.....
- Yeah...it's really weird


79
00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:15.606
Fucking weird.....

80
00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:24.378
My father asked me to give
this to you


81
00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:26.395
It was Vasili's

82
00:12:26.943 --> 00:12:30.998
My mom wanted to throw it away.
She hated the communists.


83
00:12:31.672 --> 00:12:36.026
My brother's son is here ! You
should behave in a civilized manner !


84
00:12:36.027 --> 00:12:38.427
Why are you such a coward ?
Tell him like a man that.....


85
00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:42.178
I'd like to go to Australia.
The sun, the beaches.....


86
00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:45.947
...the desert, surf and all this....
the models.....


87
00:12:46.817 --> 00:12:48.726
Have you got a girlfriend ?

88
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:50.936
No, I'm gay

89
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.193
Do you have a boyfriend ?

90
00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:59.567
No, no..no boyfriend.
Just lots of random sex


91
00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:01.868
- But....he's gay !
- Cut it out !


92
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.808
So....how was the exhibition ?

93
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.317
OK...it was good...I think...

94
00:13:07.335 --> 00:13:09.341
- It was good ?
- It was great !


95
00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:12.822
Who buys these paintings ?

96
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.687
We'd buy one. Adriana, let's buy one
of Isaac's paintings !


97
00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:18.208
They're not actually paintings.

98
00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:20.209
It's.....photography......

99
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.469
Then, we'll buy three !

100
00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:24.531
- Done !
- Done ! Which ones ?


101
00:13:24.572 --> 00:13:27.137
I don't care. You choose....

102
00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.978
You'd best keep drinking

103
00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:33.510
So, what have you been doing
since you got here ?


104
00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:36.456
Not much. I walked through
the city and took some photos


105
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:41.478
We don't go to the city anymore. It's
been taken over by the refugees


106
00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.585
They're pigs !The government
should just get rid of them


107
00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:47.415
Isn't that what the people used
to say about the Jews ?


108
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.579
Our family....we protected Jews
during the war !!


109
00:13:50.658 --> 00:13:53.725
- We saved lives !
- Right...I've never heard that before


110
00:13:53.852 --> 00:13:55.792
- Vasili never told you ?
- No


111
00:13:55.948 --> 00:13:58.661
You'd think dad, of all people, would
have mentioned something like that ?


112
00:13:58.935 --> 00:14:03.393
-And so...you're gonna go to Papigo ?
- Yeah, tomorrow


113
00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:05.537
Adriana....please !

114
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:07.651
With Vasili's ashes ?

115
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:15.758
Your father.....
he just ran away !


116
00:14:15.943 --> 00:14:18.419
Dad left because of the fascists !

117
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.584
What a lier !

118
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.035
Who stayed here and looked after
his elderly parents ?


119
00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.936
.....took care of them ?
...paid for them ?


120
00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:33.280
Giorgio did ! The younger brother did !
And where was Vasili ?


121
00:14:33.349 --> 00:14:35.336
What are you talking about ?
Dad sent money


122
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:40.242
And now his son comes back here and
I have to have him in my home !


123
00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:43.484
And he's just the same !
Lies and more lies !


124
00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:45.018
Isaac !

125
00:14:45.668 --> 00:14:46.668
I'm sorry !

126
00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.368
- What the fuck ?
- I know .....


127
00:14:49.562 --> 00:14:52.881
-Is she crazy ?
- Yes, yes. They're all crazy


128
00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:58.280
- She hates me
-No, she doesn't hate you! She's just..


129
00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:04.170
......stuck ! You know what I mean ?
I don't care about any of that shit !


130
00:15:04.205 --> 00:15:05.327
Really !

131
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:11.269
- So, you're leaving ?
- Yeah


132
00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:14.462
I could come with you....
if you want ?


133
00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:18.215
<i>This is Niko. 
Leave a message</i>

134
00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:21.198
Niko, it's me, Isaac

135
00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.811
Why ain't you returning my calls ?

136
00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:27.884
I'm in Athens, I'm gonna go to Papigo
to scatter dad's ashes


137
00:16:27.957 --> 00:16:32.627
I thought you'd be here already. You're
my brother, I need you to come with me


138
00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:41.663
(=Park "Pedio Areos", a gay
cruising place, at your own risk !)


139
00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:25.525
You alright ?

140
00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:32.465
Yes.....alright

141
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.593
Come on !

142
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:54.828
Look, I'm gonna go. Can I buy you
some food....or something ?


143
00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:58.821
No

144
00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:06.670
Nice camera

145
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.754
Thanks !

146
00:18:10.693 --> 00:18:11.960
You....?

147
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.446
.....take photo ?

148
00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:15.674
Of you ?

149
00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:18.497
- At my house ?
- Yeah !


150
00:18:19.607 --> 00:18:20.879
Yeah, I can do that

151
00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:23.569
OK

152
00:18:23.763 --> 00:18:27.012
- I'm Isaac
- Yosef


153
00:18:27.268 --> 00:18:29.416
I live not far

154
00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:15.317
Come on ! Please !

155
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.280
Come on !

156
00:20:07.357 --> 00:20:11.243
Hi ! I'm Isaac. He was being robbed
and I found him


157
00:20:14.452 --> 00:20:15.700
Come !

158
00:20:26.328 --> 00:20:29.161
- Coffee ?
-That would be great !


159
00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:31.373
Natalia

160
00:20:39.457 --> 00:20:42.536
You can take some more...?
Just like this ?


161
00:20:42.537 --> 00:20:44.437
(=Aliens Temporary Residence Permit)

162
00:20:44.587 --> 00:20:47.097
You want me to take
a passport portrait ?


163
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.248
Some more....

164
00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:54.194
Shit !

165
00:20:59.071 --> 00:21:01.139
Are you OK ?

166
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:05.606
You want a blowjob ?

167
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.890
No...no

168
00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:15.331
- You want to fuck ?
- No...I was....


169
00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:20.533
I was actually wondering  if it'd be OK
if I took some photos here ?


170
00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.335
- Photos ?
- Yeah.....


171
00:21:24.982 --> 00:21:26.500
OK

172
00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:31.105
No, no, no !  Look....

173
00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:36.513
To exhibit....
To show people


174
00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:40.267
-Are you police ?
- No, no ! I'm not !


175
00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:42.431
I'm not police

176
00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:44.236
OK

177
00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:54.484
You're fucking kidding me !

178
00:21:55.377 --> 00:21:57.176
OK, I'm outta film

179
00:21:58.146 --> 00:22:02.078
Look ! I'm gonna get a taxi, get
more film....I'll be back.  OK ?


180
00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:09.068
You won't be back....

181
00:22:09.217 --> 00:22:11.980
I will ! I promise !

182
00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:14.007
Wait !

183
00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:18.587
She's not my mother

184
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:22.888
Help me !

185
00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.863
Please !

186
00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:28.623
I'll be back in an hour

187
00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:46.356
Yosef ?

188
00:23:51.558 --> 00:23:52.558
Natalia ?

189
00:23:55.145 --> 00:23:56.145
Yosef !!

190
00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:58.468
Quiet ! Please, it's late !

191
00:23:58.714 --> 00:24:01.458
Look I know, I'm sorry. I'm looking
for Natalia and Yosef ?


192
00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:03.577
He left, long time ago

193
00:24:03.638 --> 00:24:05.312
I was just with them....

194
00:24:05.468 --> 00:24:08.377
- She's dead. Gone...
- Many months ago


195
00:24:09.203 --> 00:24:11.491
- The boy is gone
- No, no !


196
00:24:12.152 --> 00:24:13.152
Natalia !

197
00:24:38.546 --> 00:24:39.564
Natalia !

198
00:24:40.487 --> 00:24:42.015
Yosef !!

199
00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:36.585
Hey Isaac !

200
00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:39.039
I'm sorry. Andreas.....

201
00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:42.302
-...the designated driver was late
- I had a big night


202
00:25:42.653 --> 00:25:47.233
Andreas, this is my handsome and
talented cousin, Isaac....


203
00:25:47.289 --> 00:25:49.243
...whom I told you about.

204
00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:53.212
I can tell you right now I'm not staying
in any fucking youth hostel !


205
00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:01.179
Well, if you're so worried about it,
maybe your handsome....


206
00:26:01.244 --> 00:26:06.134
...talented, back-packing cousin
can drive us there !


207
00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:09.303
- You can drive, can't you Isaac ?
- Yeah


208
00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:10.445
Right, get in !

209
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:12.735
I'm wasted and you don't have a license

210
00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:15.573
It' ll be fine.
Let's go ! Papigo !

211
00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:29.487
Andreas'es father is also
from the mountains


212
00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:32.049
You call me a peasant ?

213
00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:34.476
I love peasant boys !

214
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:40.190
-Yes, for a dirty week end
- Now, that you're getting married...yes


215
00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:42.304
Are you getting married ?

216
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.636
Yeah !

217
00:27:21.232 --> 00:27:23.287
First time in the mountains ?

218
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:26.956
Yeah. It's my first time in Greece

219
00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:36.858
Thanks !

220
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:42.739
Yulia told me about your father

221
00:27:42.746 --> 00:27:44.698
What did she say ?

222
00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:48.664
She said something about him
being cursed....?


223
00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:52.422
You fucking kidding me ?

224
00:27:53.157 --> 00:27:55.040
Thirsty ?

225
00:27:57.065 --> 00:27:58.065
No

226
00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:20.908
What the fuck are you doing Isaac ?

227
00:29:22.226 --> 00:29:24.306
Nothing

228
00:29:27.654 --> 00:29:29.496
I thought.......

229
00:29:31.964 --> 00:29:34.208
It's nothing

230
00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:52.586
<i>We don't need all this junk !</i>

231
00:29:56.731 --> 00:29:59.137
<i>What are you doing now ?</i>

232
00:31:47.988 --> 00:31:49.273
Isaac ?

233
00:31:49.537 --> 00:31:53.011
I met this woman.
She knew your father


234
00:32:00.145 --> 00:32:02.445
Coffee ? Isaac, coffee ?

235
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.141
No

236
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:50.153
What the fuck ?

237
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.556
This is fucking bullshit !

238
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:08.281
Isaac !

239
00:34:23.523 --> 00:34:25.559
Relax !

240
00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:16.786
Yosef ?

241
00:36:22.107 --> 00:36:23.107
Yosef !!

242
00:36:23.201 --> 00:36:26.741
<i>You said you'd come back
Why didn't you help me ?</i>


243
00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.686
I feel like shit

244
00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:26.955
You look beautiful

245
00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:31.343
I need to give up drugs

246
00:37:31.608 --> 00:37:33.798
So do I....

247
00:37:37.108 --> 00:37:39.442
You want me to come with you ?

248
00:37:39.772 --> 00:37:43.609
Well it doesn't look like
anyone else is coming


249
00:37:42.723 --> 00:37:46.042
I wish by brother had turned up

250
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:49.201
Don't let that old woman
freak you out


251
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:52.188
I don't know.....

252
00:38:00.182 --> 00:38:03.123
Dad, you know, never wanted to talk
about the mountains


253
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:06.839
- Maybe he was scared
- Yeah, right.....


254
00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:13.866
You told Andreas
my father was cursed.


255
00:38:14.171 --> 00:38:15.243
Why ?

256
00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:16.828
Grandma said it !

257
00:38:16.882 --> 00:38:21.063
Your father...he carried some kind of...

258
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.677
- You know....
- You don't believe that ! Do you ?


259
00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:25.234
No !!

260
00:38:25.458 --> 00:38:27.984
- Maybe !
-How can ya take any of that shit seriously?


261
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:30.046
- It's not that simple !
- Yeah, it is !


262
00:38:30.098 --> 00:38:32.690
Then, who's Elias, the Jewish boy ?
My father said.....


263
00:38:32.825 --> 00:38:34.910
How the fuck should I know ?

264
00:38:35.225 --> 00:38:36.343
Here !

265
00:38:37.528 --> 00:38:39.631
Put this on !

266
00:38:40.804 --> 00:38:44.501
Do it for me !
Please ?


267
00:38:49.374 --> 00:38:51.808
Do it for your father

268
00:38:56.163 --> 00:38:59.105
I think I should just do this
on my own, you know....


269
00:39:00.003 --> 00:39:02.045
I came because you're my cousin !

270
00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.810
I appreciated it but you and
Andreas should go.


271
00:39:04.985 --> 00:39:07.760
I'll get the bus back alone

272
00:39:08.865 --> 00:39:10.396
ÏÊ

273
00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:12.244
Thanks !

274
00:39:16.252 --> 00:39:18.267
I'll see you

275
00:41:05.511 --> 00:41:07.667
Vasilis Raftis

276
00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.185
- Speak english !
- No english !


277
00:42:30.807 --> 00:42:33.301
<i>Why didn't you help me ?
Why didn't you help me ?</i>


278
00:42:40.492 --> 00:42:43.650
<i>This is Niko. 
Leave a message. Thanks</i>

279
00:42:43.704 --> 00:42:46.714
Hey, it's me. I'm going to Paris,
to see Gerry


280
00:42:46.815 --> 00:42:48.917
He's an old friend of dad's

281
00:42:49.046 --> 00:42:52.302
And then I'm coming to Budapest Niko,
like it or not !


282
00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.057
Isaac !

283
00:43:21.512 --> 00:43:23.641
Isaac Raftis ?

284
00:43:23.918 --> 00:43:25.025
Yeah

285
00:43:25.802 --> 00:43:27.733
Let's go...

286
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.429
When he came to France we called him
Guillaume (=typical French name)


287
00:43:37.965 --> 00:43:41.371
And he gave his
son a Jew's name !

288
00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:43.977
- What's wrong with that ?
- Nothing !


289
00:43:44.016 --> 00:43:46.022
I'm a Jew

290
00:43:46.986 --> 00:43:50.394
Did my father ever talk about Greece
during the war ?


291
00:43:50.673 --> 00:43:53.420
About someone the family protected ?

292
00:43:53.479 --> 00:43:55.571
Did he mention a boy ?

293
00:43:55.718 --> 00:43:59.562
A boy ? Yes,
he talked about a boy

294
00:43:59.672 --> 00:44:01.386
Elias ?

295
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:04.171
I don't remember the name

296
00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:06.174
Could it have been Elias ?

297
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.158
I'll tell you everything, but first
I need you to help me


298
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.452
How ?

299
00:44:10.779 --> 00:44:14.143
There's someone I want you
to meet. She's a refugee.....


300
00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:16.894
I want you to help her
get to Australia


301
00:44:16.942 --> 00:44:19.626
I'll pay you. 5,000 Euros

302
00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:23.705
- Look...I don't know
- I've got a passport for her....


303
00:44:23.836 --> 00:44:26.993
...all you have to do is
accompany her !


304
00:44:32.483 --> 00:44:34.704
So, how did he die ?

305
00:44:37.776 --> 00:44:39.875
In his car.....

306
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.939
There was an accident. He went
into the back of a truck


307
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:46.387
- An accident ?
- Yeah


308
00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:51.528
This is Amina. Amina...Isaac.
The man I was telling you about


309
00:45:51.907 --> 00:45:56.567
Here...stay here, with Amina.
Look after her.


310
00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.071
You can come for dinner,
at our house tonight.


311
00:46:00.191 --> 00:46:02.909
Amina will show you how
to get there.


312
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:09.637
Don't touch her !
Don't lay a hand onto her !


313
00:46:18.635 --> 00:46:21.831
- Coffee ?
- Sure. Thanks.


314
00:46:21.957 --> 00:46:23.491
Please !

315
00:46:28.724 --> 00:46:31.587
Is this your first time in Paris ?

316
00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:34.502
This is my first time in Europe

317
00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:36.325
Thanks

318
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:42.011
Did Gerry tell you about my situation ?

319
00:46:42.158 --> 00:46:44.746
He said you're a refugee

320
00:46:45.147 --> 00:46:47.869
He didn't tell you I'm pregnant ?

321
00:46:47.929 --> 00:46:49.248
No

322
00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:54.866
Well.....he has told me
about your father


323
00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:57.453
They were in the
(Communist) Party together


324
00:46:57.554 --> 00:47:00.848
They were the real, true radicals,
he said


325
00:47:02.293 --> 00:47:04.705
Yeah, it sounds like him

326
00:47:05.749 --> 00:47:08.552
He's dead now...your father ?

327
00:47:09.432 --> 00:47:12.480
He died recently, yeah.

328
00:47:14.256 --> 00:47:16.492
I'm very sorry

329
00:47:47.227 --> 00:47:51.070
I wonder what your father would think
of Paris these days


330
00:48:04.622 --> 00:48:07.502
He's my friend. He's gonna
help me go to Australia


331
00:48:49.422 --> 00:48:51.432
You look worried

332
00:48:52.787 --> 00:48:54.797
I guess I am

333
00:48:55.397 --> 00:48:56.978
Why ?

334
00:48:58.248 --> 00:49:03.652
I don't know. I came here
to put my dad to rest....in peace


335
00:49:03.694 --> 00:49:07.314
- And it didn't happen ?
- Not at all !


336
00:49:08.748 --> 00:49:12.145
There is this story....
Gerry knows it


337
00:49:12.165 --> 00:49:15.670
Some Jewish boy....and
my dad apparently....


338
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.795
..had some kind of curse

339
00:49:17.862 --> 00:49:20.051
Maybe he did !

340
00:49:20.161 --> 00:49:22.235
You believe that stuff ?

341
00:49:22.313 --> 00:49:26.583
- I see it. Again and again
- See what ?


342
00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:31.758
When innocent blood is spilled,
the hate attaches to the guilty


343
00:49:31.788 --> 00:49:33.439
Come on !

344
00:49:33.482 --> 00:49:35.415
Are you making fun of me ?

345
00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:40.306
No, I'm not making fun of you, I just
think it sounds like an excuse for revenge


346
00:49:40.586 --> 00:49:43.967
Oh ! Ask the Jews about
using excuse for revenge...


347
00:49:43.994 --> 00:49:46.694
- The Jews ?
- Isn't that what they do ?


348
00:49:46.731 --> 00:49:51.145
Spill blood as an excuse
for revenge at Palestinians ?


349
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:53.212
What are you talking about ?

350
00:49:53.265 --> 00:49:55.013
- The Holocaust
- Yeah ?


351
00:49:55.363 --> 00:49:57.592
It shouldn't be used
to make others suffer


352
00:49:57.675 --> 00:50:00.104
- I didn't say that it should...
- But Israel does !


353
00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:03.071
They do what ever they want to people,
all because of the Holocaust


354
00:50:03.219 --> 00:50:05.829
For Jews it's part of their culture

355
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.962
Christ died in their hands

356
00:50:08.002 --> 00:50:10.714
- You don't believe that crap !
-It's written in your Bible !


357
00:50:10.763 --> 00:50:12.575
But...that's just bullshit !

358
00:50:12.629 --> 00:50:15.256
They murdered children
for their rituals !


359
00:50:15.392 --> 00:50:18.543
They cooked them and ate them !
Christian children !


360
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:22.690
For fuck's sake ! It's like saying that
all Moslems are terrorists !


361
00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:26.806
The Jews....they think
they're so special !


362
00:50:27.502 --> 00:50:29.513
Are you laughing at me ?

363
00:50:29.532 --> 00:50:32.370
Yeah, I'm laughing at you because
I think you're fucking insane


364
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:34.869
Who are you to laugh at me ?

365
00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:36.845
Good morning Sir, Madam !

366
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.910
Good morning

367
00:50:39.019 --> 00:50:41.405
Is everything alright madam ?

368
00:50:41.866 --> 00:50:45.760
Just fine. We're just having a bit
of a disagreement. We're OK.


369
00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.863
Your ID cards, please ?

370
00:50:49.923 --> 00:50:51.905
Sorry, I don't speak french

371
00:50:51.958 --> 00:50:54.053
Papers please !

372
00:50:54.547 --> 00:50:56.809
- Yes, yes
- Yes


373
00:51:05.477 --> 00:51:07.433
Here you are

374
00:51:16.982 --> 00:51:19.048
Catch her !

375
00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:30.292
Isaac, help me !

376
00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:52.002
Good evening

377
00:51:52.156 --> 00:51:55.150
I'm Isaac Raftis

378
00:51:55.535 --> 00:51:59.515
Vasilis' son.
Gerry asked me to come


379
00:52:07.441 --> 00:52:10.053
Isaac ! Come in please.

380
00:52:12.518 --> 00:52:15.999
Amina ? How she is ?
She's alright ?


381
00:52:16.116 --> 00:52:17.665
Yeah

382
00:52:32.645 --> 00:52:36.232
Doesn't he remind you of Vasili, Leah ?

383
00:52:37.242 --> 00:52:40.969
It's been a long time since
I've seen Vasili


384
00:52:41.171 --> 00:52:44.930
- How is he ?
- Dead.....


385
00:52:45.883 --> 00:52:47.595
How ?

386
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.045
A car accident

387
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:53.807
Too close to a truck

388
00:53:08.648 --> 00:53:11.426
So, you knew my father too ?

389
00:53:11.985 --> 00:53:13.577
I did

390
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.937
When he was in Paris ?

391
00:53:16.095 --> 00:53:19.843
- Yes
-He was deeply involved in the movement


392
00:53:20.792 --> 00:53:23.404
He left Greece because of the fascists

393
00:53:23.543 --> 00:53:26.081
Is that what he told you ?

394
00:53:26.279 --> 00:53:28.995
Why do you think he left ?

395
00:53:29.532 --> 00:53:32.028
He left Greece to escape the past
and then.....


396
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.093
...he left Paris because the past
caught up with him


397
00:53:35.193 --> 00:53:37.480
What was he escaping in his past ?

398
00:53:37.524 --> 00:53:39.394
Himself

399
00:53:39.464 --> 00:53:44.841
But no one escapes himself today
...even in the end


400
00:53:44.917 --> 00:53:47.411
- What do you mean ?
- Well.....


401
00:53:48.007 --> 00:53:51.718
You father killed himself,
didn't he ?


402
00:54:01.915 --> 00:54:04.248
Where's your bathroom ?

403
00:54:28.545 --> 00:54:31.546
This bitch betrayed us !
She betrayed Amina !


404
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:43.139
- So you sent her to hell !
- That factory belongs to me too !


405
00:54:45.842 --> 00:54:50.122
I was helping her get away. She was
leaving with Isaac to Australia !


406
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:58.906
Run and chase you fucking Moslem whore ?

407
00:55:31.083 --> 00:55:33.135
<i>You won't be back....</i>

408
00:55:34.694 --> 00:55:36.756
<i>You said you'd come back.....</i>

409
00:55:36.912 --> 00:55:38.991
<i>Why didn't you help me ?</i>

410
00:55:39.311 --> 00:55:41.279
<i>Elias !</i>

411
00:57:29.749 --> 00:57:31.255
Yosef....?

412
00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.576
Hello ?

413
00:57:50.715 --> 00:57:53.363
- It's me...
- Where are you ?


414
00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:56.882
-I've been in Paris, with Gerry
- Who ?


415
00:57:57.135 --> 00:58:00.627
You know...dad's old comrade.
He emailed me


416
00:58:00.694 --> 00:58:03.274
- Gerry is dead, isn't he ?
- No mom....


417
00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:08.337
...I was just at his house. He was
there with his wife, Leah


418
00:58:08.806 --> 00:58:11.440
-Leah was there ?
- Mom...?


419
00:58:11.463 --> 00:58:15.375
- ...I'm going to Budapest
- Isaac, come home !


420
00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:17.300
No mom. I haven't seen Niko
in years


421
00:58:17.437 --> 00:58:21.777
Isaac, you need to stay away
from your brother !


422
00:58:21.794 --> 00:58:24.096
- What happened to Elias ?
- What ?


423
00:58:24.142 --> 00:58:27.703
Elias, mom. What happened to Elias ?
The boy ?


424
00:58:27.792 --> 00:58:29.816
What boy ?

425
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:32.631
You know whom  I'm talking about !

426
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:36.996
You can't help the past now.

427
00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.564
Niko ?

428
00:59:59.628 --> 01:00:00.924
Niko ?

429
01:00:18.976 --> 01:00:20.209
Niko ?

430
01:00:22.879 --> 01:00:24.921
For fuck's sake !

431
01:00:25.905 --> 01:00:27.455
Isaac....

432
01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:30.189
Why would you do that for ?

433
01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:33.803
You weren't at the station !

434
01:00:34.994 --> 01:00:36.229
Yeah

435
01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:42.661
How long have you been using for ?
I thought you'd given up...


436
01:00:43.441 --> 01:00:45.903
Just since dad.....

437
01:00:54.811 --> 01:00:58.447
What the fuck are you doing here ?

438
01:00:59.378 --> 01:01:02.151
What you.....?
I've been leaving messages !


439
01:01:03.156 --> 01:01:05.828
When would you
fucking call me back ?


440
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:08.574
I didn't want to.

441
01:01:13.543 --> 01:01:16.268
I need to talk to you

442
01:01:17.339 --> 01:01:19.761
Yeah, I can see that

443
01:01:19.795 --> 01:01:22.016
Christ...Niko !

444
01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:29.765
Did you talk to
him before he died ?

445
01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:31.983
Yeah

446
01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:33.750
What did he say ?

447
01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:40.754
He said I was a good son

448
01:01:43.689 --> 01:01:46.528
What a cunt !

449
01:02:02.017 --> 01:02:05.725
I don't know what is
happening to me Niko


450
01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:11.274
You're in the right place.....

451
01:02:25.445 --> 01:02:27.829
What's wrong ?

452
01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:33.997
There's this boy....

453
01:02:36.824 --> 01:02:43.836
I keep seeing him....it's the same boy
that I met in Athens, a refugee boy


454
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.001
Yeah....

455
01:02:45.446 --> 01:02:48.488
Everywhere I go, there he is.

456
01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:53.124
-That's because he's everywhere
- What ?


457
01:02:53.258 --> 01:02:56.514
Boys like that, they're everywhere.
That's you !


458
01:02:56.615 --> 01:02:58.927
A continent of lost souls

459
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:04.283
Have you taken any good photos
on your trip ?


460
01:03:04.522 --> 01:03:09.928
-I'm not doing that anymore
-Why not ? You're fucking good at it


461
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:15.384
I think dad may have killed himself

462
01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:20.162
I guess he had his demons

463
01:03:20.499 --> 01:03:23.719
Dad helped the Jewish boy
during the war !


464
01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:25.953
His name was Elias

465
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.603
Elias.....

466
01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:32.384
Something happened to him.
Something terrible.....


467
01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:38.160
-Do you believe in curses ?
- No


468
01:03:38.279 --> 01:03:41.280
And neither do you !

469
01:04:34.642 --> 01:04:36.828
Wanna go for a drink ?

470
01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.398
Yeah

471
01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:42.932
My boss King Kike is having some
people over.


472
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:46.630
-Kike ? (=racial slur for a Jew)
- That's what he calls himself


473
01:04:46.645 --> 01:04:49.753
-You have a problem with that ?
- No


474
01:05:02.473 --> 01:05:05.673
Beautiful Budapest, huh ?

475
01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:11.448
So, how's your trip been ?

476
01:05:12.648 --> 01:05:15.006
It's been interesting

477
01:05:15.855 --> 01:05:19.223
- I've learned a lot
- Really ? What about ?


478
01:05:20.955 --> 01:05:24.066
About you....
about my family....


479
01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.257
Your family ?

480
01:05:26.354 --> 01:05:28.946
What did you learn about your family ?

481
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.465
There was a boy.....

482
01:05:32.697 --> 01:05:34.973
A Jewish boy ?

483
01:05:36.163 --> 01:05:38.858
Elias ? Wasn't that his name ?

484
01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:45.973
-Did Niko tell you that ?
- Of course he did


485
01:05:46.252 --> 01:05:51.289
Everyone tell me these stories.
Everyone has one....


486
01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:53.803
They all come to work for the Jew....

487
01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:57.556
...and they all tell me the stories
of their families.....


488
01:05:57.657 --> 01:05:59.934
...of the poor little Jewish
boys and girls.....


489
01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:03.059
It's all bullshit

490
01:06:03.224 --> 01:06:07.030
No one really protected the Jews

491
01:06:07.355 --> 01:06:12.184
My whole family was taken
to the camps....


492
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:17.631
...and now, all these years later,
I live here and I thrive here.


493
01:06:18.177 --> 01:06:20.358
Ironic, isn't it ?

494
01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:16.137
I don't believe you !

495
01:07:16.524 --> 01:07:18.960
You know about Elias !

496
01:07:58.985 --> 01:08:01.066
What's that ?

497
01:08:02.825 --> 01:08:05.348
Welcome to my office

498
01:08:05.435 --> 01:08:07.627
Christ ! Niko !

499
01:08:07.832 --> 01:08:12.802
It's not for much longer.
Sit ! Fuck him !


500
01:08:15.788 --> 01:08:18.147
I'm paying off the day

501
01:08:22.652 --> 01:08:24.804
What the fuck has happened to you ?

502
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:28.376
Fuck you, you self-righteous little
shit ! I didn't ask you to come here !


503
01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:29.877
Fuck you, go home !

504
01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:32.835
Go home and tell mom she's right about
the whole fucking curse and....


505
01:08:32.836 --> 01:08:35.136
...Niko is a junkie and
porn-rich and well.


506
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:37.224
- Fuck you !
- Fuck you !!


507
01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:39.453
It would kill her if
I told her the truth

508
01:08:39.492 --> 01:08:42.434
Why don't you ?
You killed dad by coming to Europe !


509
01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:44.068
What ?

510
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:46.769
You don't understand anything, do you ?
You're such a fucking baby !


511
01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:48.756
Where were you when dad died, huh ?

512
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.663
Where the fuck were you ?

513
01:08:50.837 --> 01:08:56.411
You think our father was so noble !
The great Vasilis fucking Raftis !


514
01:08:58.192 --> 01:09:00.442
He was a murderer !

515
01:09:01.478 --> 01:09:04.642
He killed that boy.... Elias.

516
01:09:10.172 --> 01:09:13.809
- Am I supposed to believe that ?
- It's the fucking truth


517
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.714
Dad wasn't even old enough at the time

518
01:09:18.879 --> 01:09:21.560
Yeah, he was. It was right at
the end of the war.


519
01:09:21.977 --> 01:09:22.977
Bullshit !

520
01:09:23.051 --> 01:09:25.535
Our family was supposed
to look after him


521
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:29.506
They promised his father they would.
They even took money for him


522
01:09:29.653 --> 01:09:33.627
They hid him in the basement of
the old church and.....then....


523
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:36.607
...they betrayed him

524
01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:40.800
That wasn't dad.
Dad wouldn't take any money !


525
01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:42.138
No ?

526
01:09:42.143 --> 01:09:45.672
He took him food though, that was his
job, taking scraps and eggs and shit...


527
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:49.931
And one day he stopped !
Do you know why he stopped ?


528
01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:54.617
Because our great, sanctified,
grandmother Lucia....


529
01:09:54.793 --> 01:09:59.272
...molested the little boy and
then fucked him


530
01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:02.641
She was supposed to be looking after
him and she fucked him


531
01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:06.037
Dad was sorry, but he didn't do anything
about it. Fucking nothing !


532
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.711
He stopped taking him food...
he didn't go see him....


533
01:10:08.763 --> 01:10:10.795
...he didn't tell anybody anything...

534
01:10:10.869 --> 01:10:13.066
What he did was wait for weeks.....

535
01:10:13.106 --> 01:10:16.511
....untill he was sure that boy
would be dead


536
01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.975
He climbed down inside that church....

537
01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:22.603
It stunk of vomit, shit and blood.

538
01:10:22.784 --> 01:10:27.224
And there was Elias. Lying there
like a skeleton


539
01:10:27.371 --> 01:10:30.436
He'd eaten the moss of the bricks
and the soil from the ground.


540
01:10:30.442 --> 01:10:32.489
He was still alive !

541
01:10:32.567 --> 01:10:36.337
And dad picked up a rock and
smashed it into his skull....


542
01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:38.616
He hit him again and again !

543
01:10:38.748 --> 01:10:43.647
And Elias cursed him, sworn that
he would haunt him for ever.


544
01:10:43.799 --> 01:10:49.492
Him and his sons.....
and his sons' sons !


545
01:10:51.076 --> 01:10:54.256
The fucking past

546
01:10:54.572 --> 01:11:00.411
All this shit !  
Fucking Europe !!

547
01:11:02.093 --> 01:11:05.754
Don't you wish some time that
not one Jew.....?


548
01:11:05.755 --> 01:11:08.172
....ever walked the face of the Earth ?

549
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.658
Niko, this is for you darling

550
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:38.325
This one ?

551
01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:40.874
You like him ?

552
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:47.174
Just arrived. Very fresh !

553
01:12:51.222 --> 01:12:54.175
I'll pay you what ever you want

554
01:12:54.926 --> 01:12:57.113
Good choice !

555
01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:06.073
Come with me

556
01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:02.098
Elias ?

557
01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.997
You're Elias ?

558
01:14:09.637 --> 01:14:11.710
<i>Help me !</i>

559
01:14:13.138 --> 01:14:18.133
<i>She's not my mother
You said you'll come back</i>


560
01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:19.883
<i>Help me !</i>

561
01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.828
<i>Why didn't you help me ?</i>

562
01:14:21.927 --> 01:14:24.519
Why didn't you help me ?

563
01:14:27.735 --> 01:14:30.358
Why didn't you help me ? !!

564
01:14:52.168 --> 01:14:54.245
You !!

565
01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:57.963
I'm gonna kill you !

566
01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:06.446
I'm gonna tear you apart,
you fucking piece of shit !


567
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:10.204
Please.....

568
01:15:10.474 --> 01:15:12.881
Don't hurt me....

569
01:15:13.673 --> 01:15:15.818
Please.....

570
01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:40.713
You can help me...

571
01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:43.858
Please.....
