00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.915
- Oh, shit. He's on it.
- Fuck it, it's gonna go.


2
00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:21.417
Oh, shit. Whoa.

3
00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.319
Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Shit, shit!


4
00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:25.621
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
Ah, shit! Ah!


5
00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.190
Hey! Hey, somebody!

6
00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.158
Call the fire department.
Get the car.


7
00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.394
We're gonna have to call
air traffic control.


8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.675
I don't see him.
I don't see him.


9
00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.833
- Ah!
- He's right there.


10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.401
He looks like Gonzo up there.

11
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.036
There he is! There he is!

12
00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:41.637
- Hey!
- Jim!


13
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:43.072
It's Trudy!

14
00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:44.507
Take one of these.

15
00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:47.643
Jim, Jim, this is Trudy Wiegel
on the radio.


16
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:49.312
Over, 192.

17
00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:51.347
- Hey, Trudy. Go for Jim.
- This is Raineesha.


18
00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:53.249
She wants to say something
to you, Jim.


19
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.519
Dangle, I see your nuts!

20
00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.587
That can't be the first
time, can it, Rai-Rai?


21
00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.123
Jim!

22
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.659
So I'm still over Nevada
airspace, yes?


23
00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:05.929
You're confirmed
over Nevada airspace, Jim.


24
00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:07.272
If you could just take
a little peeksy


25
00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:08.765
inside my neighbor's backyard,

26
00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:10.776
because I think she may
have stolen my weed whacker.


27
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.002
I would much appreciate it.
Over, 10-4, good buddy.


28
00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.772
Trudy, that's a confirmation
on the weed whacker.


29
00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.874
It does look like it is
in your neighbor's yard.


30
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.109
Is there... not that you guys
aren't being helpful,


31
00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:21.544
is there anyone on the ground

32
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.055
who could give me ground
support, do you think?


33
00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.547
Um...

34
00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.551
He's heading toward
the Bowling Hall of Fame, Clem.


35
00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:30.319
You got to head him off.

36
00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:32.331
Yeah, I'm all over it.
I got eyes on him right now.


37
00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:35.358
I'm chasing him at 90 miles
an hour down 395. Stand by.


38
00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.627
I don't fucking care.

39
00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:41.030
He keeps going like this,

40
00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:42.742
pretty soon he'll be out
of our jurisdiction.


41
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.433
We'll see about that.

42
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.770
Hey, guys, and good news.
I found my Go-Gurt.


43
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:49.472
Shit.

44
00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:50.740
What?

45
00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:53.542
They're shooting at me!

46
00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.644
But they're not hitting
anything.


47
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.313
Damn it!

48
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.682
Oh, shit. Sorry, Jim.

49
00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.250
Whoo-hoo!

50
00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:02.986
Norman Reedus's company
makes these.


51
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:05.989
Ah, shit.

52
00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.224
Ah! Oh!

53
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.459
Don't worry, guys.

54
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.346
I'm actually okay.

55
00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:32.315
Oh!

56
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.450
Except my spine!
I don't have a spine anymore!


57
00:02:34.517 --> 00:02:37.653
Go, go, go, go.

58
00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.827
♫ ♫

59
00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:46.429
These last few years have
been a nightmare to be a cop.


60
00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:48.131
You're walking on eggshells,

61
00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.066
and it's twice as bad
for someone like me.


62
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.734
Maybe, like,
a hundred times as bad,


63
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.569
because I hate everybody.

64
00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:56.605
I literally
can't stand humanity.


65
00:02:56.672 --> 00:03:00.309
So for me, I got to get over
hating everybody,


66
00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:03.279
or my individual hatreds
come off like prejudice.


67
00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:05.748
I'm a good guy.
I treat everybody the same.


68
00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:07.183
I fucking hate them.

69
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.585
It's been a bad year
for cops, man.


70
00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:12.421
Between the Antifa/
Black Lives Matter guys


71
00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:14.090
that have been trying
to defund us


72
00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:18.361
and the Blue Lives Matter crowd
that actively tried to kill us,


73
00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:21.364
I should have been a fucking
garbageman like Dad said.


74
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.299
To be honest,
I thought I was gonna skate...


75
00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.134
Skate by, 'cause,
you know, I'm...


76
00:03:26.302 --> 00:03:28.737
I'm the hip-hop cop, you know?

77
00:03:28.804 --> 00:03:29.805
People like me.

78
00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:32.641
But it turns out they, uh...

79
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.110
they lumped me in.

80
00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:36.245
They lumped me in,
and they hate me too.


81
00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:38.948
Good morning, gang.

82
00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.149
- Mm.
- I hate it here.


83
00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:41.216
Good morning.

84
00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:53.162
I know it's been
a rough couple of years.


85
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.931
Suck a dick, asshole.

86
00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:57.066
You're absolutely allowed
to vent like that.


87
00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.669
Declan, the next time you feel
that rage, and I know...


88
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.705
Are you on the...
You're on your meds, yeah?


89
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.131
- Yeah.
- What are they giving you?


90
00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:05.441
LSD.

91
00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:07.543
Everything's fuzzy
on the edges and drips.


92
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.045
That's okay.

93
00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.190
But you're not thinking
about hurting anybody, right?


94
00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:12.815
Oh, yeah. All the time.

95
00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:15.151
Whatever Dr. Migifingers
has prescribed to you


96
00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:17.120
to get through this trying time,

97
00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:18.454
stick with that.

98
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.456
Why can't we all
just get along, guys?


99
00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:22.291
Right?
How come she's doing okay?


100
00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:24.427
I don't get it.
She was the most fucked-up one


101
00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.395
out of all of us,
and somehow she's doing okay.


102
00:04:28.364 --> 00:04:31.600
Sorry, that was
my medication alarm.


103
00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:36.172
- Holy shit.
- That's quite a selection.


104
00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.276
White wakes me up,
blue calms me down.


105
00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:44.847
Orange keeps the demons
from dancing all around.


106
00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:46.682
And then this blue one

107
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.151
is so I don't get
bloating and gas,


108
00:04:48.217 --> 00:04:49.953
and that I don't shit my pants.

109
00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.287
What is going on?

110
00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:52.655
How do I get me some of that?

111
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:54.490
You just call the lady
and say,


112
00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:57.060
"I'm thinking about
harming myself and others."


113
00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.761
You have to say "and," not "or."

114
00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:01.264
- Oh, you said "and others."
- And others. That's it.


115
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.865
It's the "and others."

116
00:05:02.932 --> 00:05:05.301
Uh, in other news,
everybody knows Pizza Midget.


117
00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:07.703
Oh, yeah, they got them
little midget pizzas.


118
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.139
Yeah, um, so apparently
this Q...


119
00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:12.741
or QAnon, whatever that is,

120
00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:16.212
has been, uh, saying defamatory
things about them


121
00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.489
on their message boards
and such.


122
00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:19.182
Pedophile ring
in the basement.


123
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.217
That's what they said,
but to my knowledge,


124
00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:23.119
there is not a pedophile ring
in the basement.


125
00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:24.363
- No.
- Do they have a basement?


126
00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:25.788
They don't even
have a basement.


127
00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:27.432
No, they don't even
have a pinball machine.


128
00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:28.857
So that explains
this document.


129
00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:32.128
So what's happening is
Pizza Midget


130
00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:35.164
is suing Q

131
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.565
for libel.

132
00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:39.202
And we need to...
Like "QAnon" Q?


133
00:05:39.268 --> 00:05:41.270
Yes. The actual Q.

134
00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:44.107
We need to put this in the hand

135
00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:45.841
and serve Q.

136
00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.044
How are we supposed to find Q?

137
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:50.746
The whole thing about Q
is that nobody knows where Q is.


138
00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:52.781
- Does nobody know...
- That's the whole thing.


139
00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:54.017
Is Q even a person?

140
00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:55.323
We got to put it in the trunk

141
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:56.785
of Mr. "Snuffleufagus."

142
00:05:56.852 --> 00:05:58.988
All right, wait,
are you saying "Snuffleufagus"


143
00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:00.423
or "-upagus"?

144
00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:01.857
- "-Ufagus."
- Uh-uh.


145
00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:03.559
- Is it "-upagus"?
- It's "-upagus."


146
00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:05.461
Oh, my God, dude,
don't get into this again.


147
00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:07.830
I got to get into it.
I have to get into it.


148
00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:09.698
Om break!

149
00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:12.868
All chanting: Om.

150
00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.170
It's "-upagus."

151
00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.408
Click on that article
about the Hollywood cabal...


152
00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:21.644
- There it is.
- See if there's something like,


153
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.954
"If you want to contact Q,
click here."


154
00:06:22.978 --> 00:06:24.947
- Contact Q.
- Look at all them people


155
00:06:25.014 --> 00:06:26.682
they said is pedophiles.

156
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:28.117
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.


157
00:06:28.184 --> 00:06:29.718
- Tom Hanks?
- Yeah.


158
00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:31.787
I mean, those are some
ugly-looking white people.


159
00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:34.823
Steven Spielberg
has actual horns?


160
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.568
Oh, click on the pillow guy.
The pillow guy.


161
00:06:36.592 --> 00:06:38.594
Oh, the pillow guy!

162
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.261
There's so many
I could click on, guys.


163
00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:42.098
- Hey, look at that.
- Okay.

Q's Booze Cruise.

165
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.310
They're having a convention
on a boat.


166
00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:46.669
They're actually having... yes.

167
00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:49.772
"Leaving from Panama, Florida,
to Nassau.


168
00:06:49.838 --> 00:06:52.508
Fun events, lectures,

169
00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:53.618
- I will volunteer.
- I'm dialing the number.


170
00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:55.010
I'm dialing. I'm dialing.
I'm in.

Uh, yeah, hi.

Um, I saw your...
The ad for, uh, the...


175
00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:03.286
The Q's Booze Cruise.
Hey, honey!


176
00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:04.587
Are you on the phone?

177
00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:05.821
Yes, Daddy.

178
00:07:05.888 --> 00:07:07.423
Sorry, I have many,
many children


179
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.925
who need my attention.

180
00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.494
Daddy, I'm hungry!

181
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.262
I'm here too, Daddy!

182
00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:14.630
I have a blended family,

183
00:07:14.697 --> 00:07:16.499
and my children
are always pulling at me


184
00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:18.501
in a million directions.
Ha, ha, ha.


185
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:20.603
I-I saw the posting
on our amazing...

Our amazing Q site
for the Q's Booze Cruise.

Oh, that leaves on...
That leaves on Wednesday.


188

Uh, is the big guy
gonna be there?


189
00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:33.682
Are there nine slots available?

190
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.252
There are? Great, great, great.

191
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.679
And how much...
How much are those?


192
00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:41.324
Do you have anything
cheaper than that?


193
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.025
You do?

194
00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:44.636
Do you have anything
slightly cheaper than that?


195
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.095
That sounds amazing.

196
00:07:46.162 --> 00:07:47.463
Great. Nine.

197
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.432

I'm here as an individual.

backstory today.

Oh, look at that.

to give the lady...


276
00:10:47.543 --> 00:10:49.077
Cute lady bellhops,
We give them a 5?


277
00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:50.755
- I didn't bring any money.
- Hi, how are you? Hi.


278
00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:51.914
- Stop.
- Oh! Oh, my God.


279
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.417
- Before you come on the boat...
- Uh-huh.


280
00:10:54.483 --> 00:10:55.784
- We have to do health.
- Yeah.


281
00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.329
- We have to do waiver, okay?
- Uh-huh.


282
00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:58.787
Don't read. Just sign.

283
00:10:58.854 --> 00:11:00.332
- Do not read.
- Initial. Initial. Sign.


284
00:11:00.356 --> 00:11:03.091
You have to sign a waiver
to eat at the buffet?


285
00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:05.078
Please be quiet.
I'm doing demonstration, okay?


286
00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:06.228
Please be quiet, guys.

287
00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:07.730
Ah. Ah. Ah.

288
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.040
- We take temperature bottom.
- Okay.


289
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:15.013
- Oh, right there?
- From the back. Now bend over.


290
00:11:15.037 --> 00:11:16.781
He's okay. He's okay.
Is it okay? Oh, great.


291
00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:19.007
See? Guys, this is so stupid,
it's easy.


292
00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:21.844
I have to check
your genital, okay?


293
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.822
Yeah, yeah, of course.
You just got to check that?


294
00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:26.214
No, open more, okay?
I'm looking.


295
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:28.751
Right after this, we get to go
on the stuff and everything?


296
00:11:28.817 --> 00:11:30.353
- Right up...
- No. Shh!


297
00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:31.920
- Next!
- Okay, I'm done.


298
00:11:31.987 --> 00:11:34.222
Maybe... excuse me,
if I could make a suggestion.


299
00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:37.426
If the rest of the guys could
just all get your penises out,


300
00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.671
then they're ready for her,
so then we can move it along...


301
00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:41.129
That's a great idea.

302
00:11:41.196 --> 00:11:44.066
I don't want to take
my penis out.


303
00:11:44.132 --> 00:11:46.301

304
00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:48.704

00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:50.506

you say, "lo."

00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:02.017
I have been acquitted. All good.

312
00:12:02.084 --> 00:12:04.520
- Everything is good now.
- Great.


313
00:12:04.587 --> 00:12:06.955
Hola. Bienvenidos.

314
00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:10.526
Hello. Primero Officer Memes
deporting for duty.


315
00:12:10.593 --> 00:12:11.960
That is a joke,

316
00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:14.029
but by the way,
he actually has been deported.


317
00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:15.698
But we cannot talk about it,
okay?


318
00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:18.434
But welcome. I am so happy
for you to be here.


319
00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:22.337
I'm a fun guy, but, uh,
we do have some bad news.


320
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:23.672
- Oh.
- Unfortunately.


321
00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:26.174
We are dangerously low on beer.

322
00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:27.510
- Oh.
- What?


323
00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:29.612
We currently have two types
of beer left.


324
00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:32.715
- Okay.
- It is clam-nado hot beer.


325
00:12:32.781 --> 00:12:34.216
- Ooh.
- Okay? It is very hot.


326
00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:38.487
And we also have
a clam lite lime beer.


327
00:12:38.554 --> 00:12:40.122
What if you're allergic
to clams?


328
00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:41.757
Good question! 
Let's move on!

329
00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:44.527
Oh, fun. Fun.
This is gonna be great.


330
00:12:44.593 --> 00:12:46.204
I have something very serious
to talk about now.


331
00:12:46.228 --> 00:12:48.196
- Great.
- A lot of people say


332
00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:51.299
the silent killer at sea
is diarrhea.


333
00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:52.635
- Mm.
- Not true.


334
00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:56.405
Diarrhea at sea can be loud.
Very loud.


335
00:12:56.472 --> 00:12:59.207
Now, in the next three hours,

336
00:12:59.274 --> 00:13:02.445
I am going to teach you
how to keep your diarrhea


337
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:06.148
down by the minutes using our
handy-dandy diarrhea app.


338
00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:07.816
- Oh, okay, cool.
- With any luck,


339
00:13:07.883 --> 00:13:10.085
we will be able
to keep your diarrhea


340
00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:12.621
down to the first five faces.

341
00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:14.122
- Okay.
- Is there anything


342
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:18.561
we can specifically avoid
to keep from getting


343
00:13:18.627 --> 00:13:20.228
- in the bottom three?
- Yeah.


344
00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.164
I have never seen a cruise
without diarrhea.


345
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.108
- You're gonna get it.
- I don't want to get diarrhea.


346
00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:26.001
I didn't want to be born
with one leg


347
00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:28.079
slightly shorter than the other,
but I was, and I lived with it,


348
00:13:28.103 --> 00:13:29.905
and look at me now! Bon!

349
00:13:29.972 --> 00:13:32.012
Listen, I didn't want to live
with my handsy uncle


350
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.609
when I was nine years old
either,


351
00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:36.278
but I did it
and we got through it.


352
00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:38.547
Unbelievably depressing.

353
00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:39.894
Okay, time to go to your room.

354
00:13:43.318 --> 00:13:44.853
Sorry. Excuse me.

355
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.422
Hey, Mr. Memes. Mr. Memes, hey.

356
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.391
I just wanted to ask you,
what are you guys...


357
00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:51.369
How are you guys set
for entertainment on the boat?


358
00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:53.596
Uh, you know,
we have the karaoke machine.


359
00:13:53.662 --> 00:13:55.063
It's out of order,
but, you know...


360
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.765
I would love to get
a couple minutes


361
00:13:56.832 --> 00:13:58.634
just to pitch you something...

362
00:13:58.701 --> 00:14:00.035
- Okay.
- That I think


363
00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:02.505
could change your life

364
00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:04.540
and save you a small fortune

365
00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:05.941
with your entertainment dollar.

366
00:14:06.008 --> 00:14:07.248
- Oh.
- It goes a very long way.


367
00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:08.553
We like to save money
around here.


368
00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:09.812
I can tell.

369
00:14:23.358 --> 00:14:26.028
So...

370
00:14:28.163 --> 00:14:30.866
This...

371
00:14:30.933 --> 00:14:32.601
I kind of like it, actually,
down here.


372
00:14:32.668 --> 00:14:34.603
This is executive
double platinum?


373
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.104
- Yes.
- Yeah.


374
00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:37.706
What's below executive
double platinum?


375
00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:38.874
- Nothing.
- Nothing.


376
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:40.275
- You are lowest.
- Right.


377
00:14:40.342 --> 00:14:41.577
This is rustic.

378
00:14:41.644 --> 00:14:43.211
Almost to a fault.

379
00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:44.889
It's nicer than that place
we had in Loughlin.


380
00:14:44.913 --> 00:14:47.049
By a lot. And, uh, yes.

381
00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:48.483
- You know the best part?
- Yeah.


382
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:49.985
- No windows.
- Mm.


383
00:14:50.052 --> 00:14:51.563
I have a hard time
getting to sleep sometimes,


384
00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:53.922
but I feel like there's
so little oxygen in here


385
00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:55.634
that it's gonna be pretty easy
to doze off.


386
00:14:55.658 --> 00:14:57.435
You want to work.
You want to work a little bit


387
00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:58.761
when you sleep, you know?

388
00:14:58.827 --> 00:15:00.428
- Earn your life.
- Earn your life.


389
00:15:00.495 --> 00:15:02.798
- Earn your life.
- Earn the trip, you know?


390
00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:04.543
Is that a bat?
Those aren't bats up there?


391
00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:05.901
- Oh, yes.
- Those are bats?


392
00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:08.270
Yes, they come with the room
complimentary.


393
00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:10.038
Oh, they're moving.
Look, they're moving.


394
00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:11.616
They're wiggling around.
That's beautiful.


395
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.742
- Aw, there's the baby.
- Oh, that's a baby!


396
00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:16.812
- Aw!
- They're a family.


397
00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.847
Sorry. Excuse me.

398
00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:20.716
Excuse me. Pardon me.

399
00:15:20.783 --> 00:15:22.350
Johnny Tremain has landed.

400
00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:24.086
- Hi.
- Hi!


401
00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:25.821
I'm gonna need you
to check your guns.


402
00:15:25.888 --> 00:15:27.856
- I'm good, actually.
- Oh...


403
00:15:27.923 --> 00:15:29.391
No, last Q conference
in Dallas,


404
00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:30.626
there was open carry.

405
00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:31.960
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, 42 people


406
00:15:32.027 --> 00:15:33.829
had catastrophic injuries
at bingo night.


407
00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:35.864
- Oh, well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.


408
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.265
He has a code he lives by.

409
00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:38.734
Will you just pry it
from his hand?


410
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.502
- Just pry it.
- Okay!


411
00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:42.204
If you don't pry it,
he can't give it.


412
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.373
Once you're off the boat,
Second Amendment.


413
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.920
You're the...
You're the pink hat...


414
00:15:46.975 --> 00:15:48.243
- That's you!
- Yeah, that's me.


415
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.478
You're the lady
from the peaceful protest.


416
00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:52.214
- Yeah.
- Remind me?


417
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.182
Yeah, she pooped
in Nancy Pelosi's desk


418
00:15:54.249 --> 00:15:55.727
at the big peaceful protest.
You did not!


419
00:15:55.751 --> 00:15:56.852
- Yeah.
- You're that lady?


420
00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:57.820
- Yeah. Remember?
- Look at that.


421
00:15:57.886 --> 00:15:59.788
Oh, my gosh! Whoa!

422
00:15:59.855 --> 00:16:01.423
You know Charlie Kirk.

423
00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:02.658
Color me starstruck.

424
00:16:02.725 --> 00:16:04.326
- Wow.
- Holy cow.


425
00:16:04.392 --> 00:16:06.061
Would you like to buy
a copy of my book?


426
00:16:06.128 --> 00:16:08.172
- You wrote a long book.
- Yes, please. How much is it?


427
00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:12.100
Well, they're $9.99,
but $49.99 if I autograph it.


428
00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:14.102
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.


429
00:16:14.169 --> 00:16:15.671
We'll just look at it.

430
00:16:15.738 --> 00:16:17.115
We're gonna look at it and
remember it was really great.


431
00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:18.073
- Well, think about it.
- Thank you very much.


432
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.274
This was great.

433
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.242
I'm sure there's tons
of big stars


434
00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:21.476
that we're gonna meet, so...

435
00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:23.011
I mean, I heard...

436
00:16:23.078 --> 00:16:24.512
I heard Q was here.

437
00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:25.981
So where's his book table?

438
00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.950
Or her book... their book table?

439
00:16:28.016 --> 00:16:29.417
- The Q.
- Do... do we...


440
00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:30.919
Do you recognize him?

441
00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:32.888
Here?

442
00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:34.757
- Okay, I don't know who he is.
- Mm-hmm.


443
00:16:34.823 --> 00:16:37.025
But I
-I know he's handsome.

444
00:16:37.092 --> 00:16:39.027
I know he's white,
but that's all I know.


445
00:16:39.094 --> 00:16:41.596
- Well, we all assume.
- Oh, my God.


446
00:16:41.664 --> 00:16:43.031
What?

447
00:16:43.098 --> 00:16:43.999
Are those the Black Lives
Don't Matter people


448
00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:45.400
with the little tiny guns?

449
00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:47.111
I want a picture!
I got to get a picture!


450
00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:49.047
- Got to go. Got to go.
- Have a good conference.


451
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.481
- It was nice meeting you!
- Thank you.


452
00:16:50.505 --> 00:16:53.141
Oh. Oh, thank you.

453
00:16:57.012 --> 00:16:58.446
Hey.

454
00:16:58.513 --> 00:17:02.450
Fan out. Reconnaissance.

455
00:17:02.517 --> 00:17:05.520
Don't do anything to draw
extra attention to us, okay?


456
00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:07.656
No.

457
00:17:07.723 --> 00:17:09.858
Fan out. Recon mode.

458
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.459
Can you hear me?

459
00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:12.828
Tremain to Chet.

460
00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:14.629
- Trudy.
- Yes?


461
00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:17.365
What's with the dress?

462
00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:19.601
- It's part of our backstory.
- Oh, good.


463
00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:21.770
You and I...

464
00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:23.271
- we're a couple.
- Yeah.


465
00:17:23.338 --> 00:17:25.240
You...

466
00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:27.342
are a 79-year-old Presbyterian

467
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:29.577
who owns an auto parts
dealership in Fresno


468
00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:31.847
that you bought with your dead
grandma's money.


469
00:17:31.914 --> 00:17:37.920
I am a 29-year-old trophy wife
who has a keen eye for fashion


470
00:17:37.986 --> 00:17:41.790
and a masters degree
in birds and things.


471
00:17:41.857 --> 00:17:44.026
I...

472
00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:45.393
have one flaw,

473
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.329
and it's that sometimes
I'm a little too nice.


474
00:17:47.395 --> 00:17:50.632
Our neighbor Rodrigo
has three dogs.


475
00:17:50.699 --> 00:17:51.900
One of them is missing.

476
00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:53.235
We think the nephew took him.

477
00:17:53.301 --> 00:17:55.137
I think he may have eaten him.

478
00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:57.639
If you panic,
squeeze my hand 11 times


479
00:17:57.706 --> 00:17:59.808
and we will start making out,
got it?


480
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.043
Okay.

481
00:18:01.109 --> 00:18:02.377
- Trudy?
- Hmm?


482
00:18:02.444 --> 00:18:06.081
You still didn't
explain the dress.


483
00:18:06.148 --> 00:18:08.283
Oh, I never got
to that part in the story.


484
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.660
I think I'm wearing
the wrong outfit.


485
00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:10.886
It's okay.

486
00:18:10.953 --> 00:18:13.989
Hello, um, strange...

487
00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:15.223
people.

488
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.393
And the deep state's really,
really...


489
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.263
doing... but... getting us hard.
This is my husband.


490
00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:22.664
Our neighbor's name is Rodrigo.

491
00:18:22.731 --> 00:18:24.275
- Don't do the whole thing.
- He has three dogs,


492
00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:25.633
but one of them is missing.

493
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.778
That's Raineesha.
It's Raineesha.


494
00:18:26.802 --> 00:18:27.870
It's a horrible story.

495
00:18:27.936 --> 00:18:29.304
You recognize Raineesha,
right?


496
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:31.239
I didn't at first,
I got to be honest.


497
00:18:31.306 --> 00:18:33.451
- I didn't think you did.
- Those are very distracting.


498
00:18:33.475 --> 00:18:35.911
You should put them away.
Nice meeting you, Coco.


499
00:18:35.978 --> 00:18:37.712
So nice to meet y'all too.

500
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.182
A beautiful QAnon couple.

501
00:18:40.248 --> 00:18:41.884
You should see him
with his pants off.


502
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:48.356
Hollywood's full of vampires.
Nothing but vampires.


503
00:18:50.492 --> 00:18:52.627
So nice to meet you, Julian.

504
00:18:52.694 --> 00:18:54.763
And thank you again
for getting me this free drink.


505
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.510
Yeah, if I could have
bought it, I would.


506
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.510
I couldn't buy it, though.
I couldn't buy it.


507
00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:02.370
So good to be here.
I'm surprised.


508
00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:03.882
You know, 'cause I ain't think
they was gonna have


509
00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:05.340
too many Blacks around here.

510
00:19:05.407 --> 00:19:07.109
Yeah, it's a lot
of white folk, ain't it?


511
00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:08.552
Let me tell you
a little bit about myself.


512
00:19:08.576 --> 00:19:10.412
- I'm listening.
- I'm an entrepreneur.


513
00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:12.580
- Mm!
- I own a couple of businesses.


514
00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:14.382
- Well?
- Yeah. I do real estate.


515
00:19:14.449 --> 00:19:16.351
- So, yeah...
- Married?


516
00:19:16.418 --> 00:19:18.153
- No, I am not married.
- Wait a minute.


517
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.789
I'm gonna step a little closer.
Okay, come on.


518
00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:22.791
I'm single.

519
00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.026
Look at you!

520
00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:26.294
Oh, you got me blushing
up in here.


521
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:29.164
Golly. I also like to, um,
collect my poop,


522
00:19:29.231 --> 00:19:32.634
so the government
does not clone me.


523
00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:38.173
M'kay.

524
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.442
So you guys know
who, uh, Q is?


525
00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:42.377
- Q?
- What do you mean?


526
00:19:42.444 --> 00:19:45.848
That's a weird question.
Let me ask you something.


527
00:19:45.914 --> 00:19:47.182
You guys cops?

528
00:19:47.249 --> 00:19:48.683
That's what I'm wondering.

529
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.485
That's like a cop-like question.

530
00:19:50.552 --> 00:19:53.555
- Yeah.
- "Do you know who Q is?"


531
00:19:53.621 --> 00:19:55.357
You know about
aliens and stuff.


532
00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:57.993
Let's not get into
the grays, all right?


533
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.394
Aliens are real.

534
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:01.029
You got to be careful
of them too,


535
00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:02.764
'cause they will abduct you.

536
00:20:02.831 --> 00:20:04.266
It's happened.

537
00:20:04.332 --> 00:20:06.668
And let's not talk
about the probing.


538
00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:09.471
Did... did they get
whatever was in you?


539
00:20:09.537 --> 00:20:10.638
I hope so.

540
00:20:11.739 --> 00:20:14.009
I hope so.

541
00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:15.410
Thank you. Thank you.

542
00:20:15.477 --> 00:20:18.480
Uh, welcome, searchers,
pioneers, and patriots.


543
00:20:18.546 --> 00:20:21.083
I-I hate to start off
with bad news,


544
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:24.953
but Sidney Powell will not
be giving our keynote address.


545
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.130
She is under house arrest
right now.


546
00:20:26.154 --> 00:20:28.023
Uh, I apologize.

547
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.092
And, again, ever hopeful,
ever forward.


548
00:20:30.158 --> 00:20:33.261
That is what we believe here.

549
00:20:33.328 --> 00:20:34.997
Yes, thank you.

550
00:20:35.063 --> 00:20:38.266
So, um, you know,
Q is a question,


551
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:40.302
a query, and a quest.

552
00:20:40.368 --> 00:20:43.038
And pretty soon,
it is going to be a quality,


553
00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:47.142
much like the quality time
that many of us are being denied


554
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:48.911
spending with our kids

555
00:20:48.977 --> 00:20:50.979
because of divorce court judges,

556
00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.915
resentful ex-wives,

557
00:20:52.981 --> 00:20:54.616
traitorous family members

558
00:20:54.682 --> 00:20:56.851
who screenshot
our Instagram posts


559
00:20:56.919 --> 00:21:00.923
to show family counselors who
are deciding visitation rights,


560
00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:03.391
who are believing the lies
of the deep state.


561
00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:05.360
Those masks will be lifted.

562
00:21:05.427 --> 00:21:07.262
We are about to experience

563
00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:10.765
much the same experience

564
00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:12.800
that Rowdy Roddy Piper
experienced


565
00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:15.270
in the movie "They Live,"

566
00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:16.538
when the...

567
00:21:16.604 --> 00:21:18.773
- Yeah!
- When the big, uh,


568
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.276
deep state illusion beam
was finally destroyed.


569
00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:23.311
That will soon happen for us.

570
00:21:23.378 --> 00:21:25.547
That is what Q is doing.

571
00:21:25.613 --> 00:21:27.983
And the masks will be lifted.

572
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.918
All of that will be lifted.

573
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.157
Q has cracked the code,

574
00:21:35.223 --> 00:21:36.624
and once you crack the code,

575
00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:40.462
it is so easy to see
what is hidden out there.


576
00:21:40.528 --> 00:21:44.366
What is keeping you from...
From real strength.


577
00:21:44.432 --> 00:21:47.235
From real reality.

578
00:21:47.302 --> 00:21:49.537
From real love.

579
00:21:49.604 --> 00:21:52.874
That kind of code-cracking

580
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:55.743
is what we are here

581
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.380
on this ship doing.

582
00:21:58.446 --> 00:22:00.515
You're the only ones
who can see it.


583
00:22:00.582 --> 00:22:04.719
And thank you guys so much
for being on this cruise.


584
00:22:04.786 --> 00:22:06.454
Full truth ahead.

585
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:09.324
And, um, everyone
enjoy the cruise.


586
00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:14.997
Thank you, thank you.

587
00:22:15.063 --> 00:22:16.364
Heil Hitler!

588
00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:18.033
No, Trudy, no.
Trudy, no, no, no, no.


589
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.467
I mean, kind of.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


590
00:22:19.534 --> 00:22:21.569
She's right, yeah, yeah.
Right?


591
00:22:21.636 --> 00:22:24.973
- I mean, heil all kinds of...
- Heil everybody.


592
00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:29.711
Check with staff
before you use


593
00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:32.180
any restrooms on the second,
third,


594
00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:34.082
fourth, and sixth floor.

595
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:35.417
Morning, gang.

596
00:22:35.483 --> 00:22:36.627
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


597
00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:37.651
Morning.

598
00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:42.290
Oh, God. Ooh.

599
00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:43.958
Hot, right?

600
00:22:44.026 --> 00:22:46.394
It feels like almost
dangerously so.


601
00:22:46.461 --> 00:22:48.230
- Yeah.
- Yeah, creeps up on you.


602
00:22:48.296 --> 00:22:49.964
Johnny Tremain
has a thought over here.


603
00:22:50.032 --> 00:22:52.400
The little bird, the, uh...

604
00:22:52.467 --> 00:22:54.169
the speaker.

605
00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:55.513
Little weirdy
with the short arms.


606
00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:58.073
- Oh.
- Eyeballs all over you.


607
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.275
- Mm-hmm.
- Saw that.


608
00:23:00.342 --> 00:23:01.809
I thought he was looking
at me.


609
00:23:01.876 --> 00:23:03.978
- Mm-mm.
- No, I think he's got a...


610
00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:05.806
- He got a motor...
- He got a Marty Feldman?


611
00:23:05.847 --> 00:23:06.981
Yeah. Well...

612
00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:08.326
I thought he was
looking at my vag.


613
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.493
- He got a little bit.
- Nope.


614
00:23:09.517 --> 00:23:11.453
Here's what I'm thinking.

615
00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:13.388
That horrible little
weird little midget man.


616
00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:15.390
- Yeah.
- He feels like he's got


617
00:23:15.457 --> 00:23:19.261
an itch he needs to scratch.

618
00:23:19.327 --> 00:23:21.196
- Is this code too?
- Yes.


619
00:23:21.263 --> 00:23:23.498
- Clemmie, code name: Roxy.
- Yeah.


620
00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:25.400
Could get next
to that little weirdo.


621
00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:26.701
- Know what I mean?
- Easy.


622
00:23:26.768 --> 00:23:28.870
- Honey trap.
- Seduction.


623
00:23:28.936 --> 00:23:30.805
I did it to become
Miss Teen Whiskey Pete's,


624
00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.140
and I can do it now.

625
00:23:32.207 --> 00:23:33.408
I believe the after-party

626
00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:35.810
is on the lido deck at 7:00.

627
00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:38.746
Perhaps there
we should lay our trap.


628
00:23:38.813 --> 00:23:40.982
I have never felt
such a sense of purpose.


629
00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:42.584
It's been a long time.

630
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.028
On behalf of the Reno
Sheriff's Department,


631
00:23:44.052 --> 00:23:47.089
I authorize you to go to third,
but not home.


632
00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.432
This might be kind of obvious,

633
00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:52.260
but home is... home run is vag.

634
00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:53.995
What would butt stuff be?

635
00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:55.930
Grand slam.

636
00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:57.065
Finishing in the butt?

637
00:23:57.132 --> 00:23:58.766
- That's a walk-off.
- Wait a minute.


638
00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:01.236
But what if you finish with
your peen between the teets?


639
00:24:01.303 --> 00:24:03.571
What is that called?
Sometimes it's just an error.


640
00:24:09.811 --> 00:24:13.181
Who is currently planning
a coup in Venezuela?


641
00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:17.219
Is it Obama? Hillary Clinton?

642
00:24:17.285 --> 00:24:20.522
George Soros? All of the above?

643
00:24:20.588 --> 00:24:22.224
Which is the best chan?

644
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.559
4chan? 8chan?

645
00:24:24.626 --> 00:24:27.495
69chan?

646
00:24:27.562 --> 00:24:30.098
German chancellor Angela Merkel
is, in fact,


647
00:24:30.165 --> 00:24:32.434
a robot sent to the future
by Adolf Hitler...


648
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.669
Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry.

649
00:24:36.738 --> 00:24:39.407
- I'm so clumsy.
- So close here. Um...


650
00:24:40.908 --> 00:24:43.345
I really liked what you were
doing onstage today.


651
00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:45.012
I noticed.

652
00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:47.982
Um...

653
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:49.617
You...

654
00:24:49.684 --> 00:24:52.154
You know a lot about this...
This Q.


655
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.921
This mysterious Q.

656
00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:55.690
I mean...

657
00:24:55.757 --> 00:24:58.126
do you have a couple hours?
Because...


658
00:24:58.193 --> 00:25:01.095
- I do.
- Oh. Well, um...


659
00:25:01.163 --> 00:25:06.568
Q is something I would like
to talk about with you.


660
00:25:06.634 --> 00:25:09.471
That was a Q symbol
I just did on your shoulder.


661
00:25:09.537 --> 00:25:12.507
Listen, I, am...

662
00:25:12.574 --> 00:25:15.310
waxed, chillaxed, and unvaxxed.

663
00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:17.812
So...

664
00:25:24.452 --> 00:25:27.155
Mr. Memes.

665
00:25:27.222 --> 00:25:28.523
Enchanting ladies

666
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.726
from... the mysterious east,

667
00:25:31.793 --> 00:25:36.798
prepare for little Mr. Jimmy
and friends,


668
00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:40.835
available in your
floating showroom


669
00:25:40.902 --> 00:25:42.704
in perpetuity

670
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.208
across the seven seas.

671
00:25:46.274 --> 00:25:49.477
Now, sit back and enjoy

672
00:25:49.544 --> 00:25:52.614
187 minutes

673
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.617
of world-class puppetry.

674
00:25:55.683 --> 00:25:58.420
Oh, fuck. Oh, got it.

675
00:26:01.022 --> 00:26:03.958
♫ It's little tiny Jimmy
and friends ♫


676
00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:06.928
♫ It's little friend Jimmy
and a box full of men ♫


677
00:26:06.994 --> 00:26:09.764
♫ If you did a little sin,
gonna make amends ♫


678
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:13.868
♫ It's tiny little Jimmy
and puppet friends ♫


679
00:26:18.906 --> 00:26:21.175
Hi, Mom!

680
00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:22.677
Here we go!

681
00:26:22.744 --> 00:26:27.449
Better get ready
to start the show.


682
00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:32.720
- Oh...
- Hey.


683
00:26:32.787 --> 00:26:34.155
Good to see you.

684
00:26:34.222 --> 00:26:35.857
Beautiful night, huh?

685
00:26:35.923 --> 00:26:36.991
Yeah.

686
00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:38.426
I guess you could call it that.

687
00:26:38.493 --> 00:26:40.328
You know,
there used to be a saying


688
00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:41.663
when I was in school.

689
00:26:41.729 --> 00:26:44.332
Why think when you can drink?

690
00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:45.833
My private stash. Go ahead.

691
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.669
- I like that saying.
- Mai tai.


692
00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:50.104
Yeah. Now it's...

693
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:51.306
Our tai.

694
00:26:52.707 --> 00:26:54.642
- Cheers.
- Oh!


695
00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:58.380
Have you ever played
"I Ain't Never"?


696
00:26:58.446 --> 00:26:59.781
"I Ain't Never." I don't...

697
00:26:59.847 --> 00:27:02.750
It's the Black version of
"Never Have I Ever."


698
00:27:02.817 --> 00:27:04.486
Well, you know,
that game is probably


699
00:27:04.552 --> 00:27:06.721
a lot more fun with women.

700
00:27:06.788 --> 00:27:08.290
- I'll start.
- Okay.


701
00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:11.058
I ain't never...

702
00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:15.563
run a ship aground
in Puerto Rico,


703
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.066
thinking that I saw someone
that I knew.


704
00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:21.736
Yeah? Mm. Mm.

705
00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:24.005
- That's so specific to you.
- Ah!


706
00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:26.774
I need you to do me a favor.
Hmm?


707
00:27:26.841 --> 00:27:28.910
Take these keys. I am...

708
00:27:28.976 --> 00:27:34.215
way too messed up to drive.

709
00:27:34.282 --> 00:27:35.783
I'm gonna walk away now.

710
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.285
I'm going to watch you.

711
00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:39.053
Bon!

712
00:27:40.388 --> 00:27:42.690
Voyage.

713
00:27:42.757 --> 00:27:44.225
What the fuck?

714
00:27:47.862 --> 00:27:49.764
How was everybody's
intermission?


715
00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:54.168
Act trois.

716
00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:56.404
In which we travel...

717
00:27:56.471 --> 00:27:59.607
south of the border.

718
00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:02.877
Fuck it. I'm sorry.

719
00:28:02.944 --> 00:28:04.646
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

720
00:28:04.712 --> 00:28:06.581
Fuck it. Oh, fuck.

721
00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:11.118
Hernan is about to learn

722
00:28:11.185 --> 00:28:16.257
a little lesson
about amigo-ship.


723
00:28:16.324 --> 00:28:17.792
And when you're on a ship,

724
00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:19.761
friend... friendship is the...

725
00:28:19.827 --> 00:28:21.596
Ah, fuck it. Sorry.

726
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.298
Hernan's gonna learn a lesson,

727
00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:27.335
that when we're helping
other people...


728
00:28:30.872 --> 00:28:33.307
Hernan... fuck it, fuck it.
Fuck it!


729
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:34.709
We're gonna skip ahead.

730
00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:36.544
Skip ahead, skip ahead.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.


731
00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:39.714
Oh!

732
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:43.317
Time to take my medication.

733
00:28:44.419 --> 00:28:45.720
Oh, shit.

734
00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:48.890
Meh, should be fine.

735
00:29:00.502 --> 00:29:02.203
Look at you.

736
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:05.773
Did you steal that gown
from a princess?


737
00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:08.743
Well, it's a Frozen
Halloween costume


738
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.178
that I bought at Rite Aid,
so, yeah, kind of.


739
00:29:14.582 --> 00:29:17.885
I'm Xavier Rothchild III.

740
00:29:17.952 --> 00:29:20.988
I quit a successful career
in the cinema


741
00:29:21.055 --> 00:29:23.525
to become a doctor for cats.

742
00:29:23.591 --> 00:29:25.927
And now,
I go wherever I'm needed,


743
00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:30.264
which is anywhere a cat
needs a doctor.


744
00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:31.899
Isn't that a...

745
00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:35.369
a veterinarian, technically?

746
00:29:35.437 --> 00:29:37.004
I don't think so.

747
00:29:37.071 --> 00:29:39.441
Okay.

748
00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:40.608
Well, my name is Trudy.

749
00:29:40.675 --> 00:29:42.477
I am an undercover cop,

750
00:29:42.544 --> 00:29:43.687
which I'm not supposed to say,

751
00:29:43.711 --> 00:29:45.212
but I kind of feel like

752
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:47.214
you and I are getting along
really well,


753
00:29:47.281 --> 00:29:51.786
and I can probably tell you
all my secrets, so...


754
00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:53.488
You can tell me anything.

755
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:56.758
- Trudy?
- Yeah?


756
00:29:56.824 --> 00:29:58.893
Would you like to join me
for a cocktail


757
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.329
and a walk around the ship?

758
00:30:02.396 --> 00:30:05.266
Well, I'm supposed to join
my friends on the lower deck


759
00:30:05.332 --> 00:30:06.668
for a diarrhea test,

760
00:30:06.734 --> 00:30:09.937
but I suppose I could.

761
00:30:13.841 --> 00:30:15.309
Oh, these are not for us.

762
00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:17.144
Uh, I put out
a cigarette in this.


763
00:30:17.211 --> 00:30:18.980
Sorry, let me get us
some fresh drinks.


764
00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:20.948
I'm not thirsty.
I'm not thirsty.


765
00:30:21.015 --> 00:30:22.550
It's okay, come with me.

766
00:30:22.617 --> 00:30:23.718
- Okay.
- Come with me.


767
00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:25.587
No, Caesar,

768
00:30:25.653 --> 00:30:28.289
I will not renounce the Christ.

769
00:30:28.355 --> 00:30:31.759
This Christ seems to have

770
00:30:31.826 --> 00:30:37.465
a power over mens' souls.

771
00:30:37.532 --> 00:30:40.535
My name is James Ron Dangle.
That is the show.


772
00:30:40.602 --> 00:30:42.236
I'm 66 years young.

773
00:30:42.303 --> 00:30:43.971
I'm between apartments
right now.


774
00:30:44.038 --> 00:30:46.474
I would love... in fact, need...

775
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:48.309
To do this for you.

776
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:50.578
But it's not just me
you have to thank


777
00:30:50.645 --> 00:30:52.213
for tonight's entertainment.

778
00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:54.582
Let's meet all

779
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:56.884
of the 88 performers

780
00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:00.321
who just brought you
this wonderful tale.


781
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:05.159
Who eats baby hearts
to stay young-looking?


782
00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:07.895
Kate Beckinsale?
Gwyneth Paltrow?


783
00:31:07.962 --> 00:31:09.831
Ryan Seacrest?

784
00:31:09.897 --> 00:31:11.499
I'm in, um...

785
00:31:11.566 --> 00:31:13.868
I'm in Cabin 1503.

786
00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:15.537
- Okay.
- 1-5-0-3.


787
00:31:15.603 --> 00:31:16.804
1503.

788
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:18.039
Which is, um, you know,

789
00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:19.974
March 15th backwards, you know.

790
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:21.576
The Ides of March.

791
00:31:21.643 --> 00:31:24.245
It kind of makes sense
they gave me that room.


792
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:26.480
I'm gonna take your word
for that.


793
00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:29.917
I liked this when I understood
what you were talking about,


794
00:31:29.984 --> 00:31:31.853
and I feel like
where you were going


795
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.356
was you were going to
ask me to...


796
00:31:35.422 --> 00:31:36.724
go bang in your room.

797
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.335
I felt like that's where
this was headed.


798
00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:40.119
Let me... really quick,
could I just, um...


799
00:31:42.797 --> 00:31:45.533
Would you come bang in my room?

800
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.902
Let me tell you
what I'm looking for from you.


801
00:31:47.969 --> 00:31:49.937
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.


802
00:31:50.004 --> 00:31:51.839
We're gonna bone

803
00:31:51.906 --> 00:31:53.207
and we're gonna talk about Q.

804
00:31:53.274 --> 00:31:55.309
We're gonna listen
to some smooth jazz.


805
00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:56.644
Uh-huh.

806
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:58.179
And we're gonna make this

807
00:31:58.245 --> 00:32:01.482
the best two-day booze cruise

808
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:04.251
in all of history.

809
00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:08.155
Prepare to have your mind
and, uh, vagina blown apart.


810
00:32:08.222 --> 00:32:09.724
Ah.

811
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.829
You got this. You got this.

812
00:32:14.896 --> 00:32:16.097
You give this guy a blowner,

813
00:32:16.163 --> 00:32:17.541
he might accidentally
tell the truth.


814
00:32:17.565 --> 00:32:18.966
Happens to me.

815
00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:20.510
He's not gonna get
too far in my pants.


816
00:32:20.534 --> 00:32:23.337
I've got an old-school Cotex
with a belt.


817
00:32:23.404 --> 00:32:25.006
- That's my girl.
- Impenetrable.


818
00:32:25.072 --> 00:32:26.674
Well, well, well.

819
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:28.409
- What do we have here?
- Oh, man!


820
00:32:28.475 --> 00:32:30.144
Talking about the kraken.

821
00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:32.279
Why are you guys living
down here in the basement?


822
00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:34.066
- It was a package deal.
- It was a package.


823
00:32:34.115 --> 00:32:36.784
It seemed like...
They make it sound way nicer.


824
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:38.285
Very affordable.

825
00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:40.054
Hey, man,
how about the great awakening?


826
00:32:40.121 --> 00:32:41.522
Yeah. The storm.

827
00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:44.258
Epstein didn't kill himself,
right?


828
00:32:44.325 --> 00:32:45.660
- Ha-ha!
- The storm's coming.


829
00:32:45.727 --> 00:32:47.494
- Come on.
- So, uh...


830
00:32:47.561 --> 00:32:50.031
word has it you guys...

831
00:32:50.097 --> 00:32:51.733
know who Q is.

832
00:32:53.034 --> 00:32:55.036
- Why would we?
- I mean...


833
00:32:55.102 --> 00:32:59.440
I'd give my body freely to Q,
just on principle.


834
00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.608
Fine.

835
00:33:02.276 --> 00:33:03.645
- FBI, guys.
- Whoa!


836
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:05.146
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.


837
00:33:05.212 --> 00:33:07.081
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.


838
00:33:07.148 --> 00:33:09.116
- God damn it.
- Oh, my God.


839
00:33:09.183 --> 00:33:10.551
- What a good badge.
- Okay...


840
00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:11.719
Reno Sheriff's Department.

841
00:33:11.786 --> 00:33:12.954
You're kidding me?

842
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.321
My name is not Jonny Tremain.

843
00:33:14.388 --> 00:33:15.666
You're deep cover
looking for...


844
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:16.858
No way.

845
00:33:16.924 --> 00:33:18.459
Oh, hey! Whoa, whoa!

846
00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:20.261
- Oh!
- Oh, man!


847
00:33:20.327 --> 00:33:22.764
- So the deep state...
- Yes.


848
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.899
Is gonna just do...

849
00:33:24.966 --> 00:33:28.302
Oh. You can cut the shit.
I'm CIA.


850
00:33:28.369 --> 00:33:29.737
You're CIA?

851
00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:31.405
I'm with Vice News.

852
00:33:31.472 --> 00:33:33.207
Is anyone QAnon
on this whole boat?


853
00:33:33.274 --> 00:33:35.018
Hold on, I'm with
"Mother Jones" journal, man.


854
00:33:35.042 --> 00:33:36.443
You think I would be here...

855
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.288
I wouldn't be wearing
all these flags and shit.


856
00:33:38.312 --> 00:33:40.214
I'm a Black man.
I thought you were a real Q.


857
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:42.684
- I thought you were real.
- Yeah, you were good!


858
00:33:44.686 --> 00:33:46.363
- You look amazing.
- You look like that lady.


859
00:33:46.387 --> 00:33:47.931
Thank you. I know.
I really do look like her.


860
00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:49.490
Now that I see you,

861
00:33:49.556 --> 00:33:51.358
I've seen you on Vice News
thousands of times.


862
00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:52.359
- Yes.
- This is the lady


863
00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:53.895
- from Vice News-
- Oh!


864
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:55.096
You made that Nazi guy cry

865
00:33:55.162 --> 00:33:57.098
in the thing
with the Proud Boys.


866
00:33:57.164 --> 00:33:59.066
I've masturbated to you.

867
00:33:59.133 --> 00:34:00.467
Since we're all
law enforcement,


868
00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:03.204
how about we, uh,
pool our resources?


869
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.948
Why would we do that?
We got a beat on them.


870
00:34:04.972 --> 00:34:06.340
I mean, we-we...

871
00:34:06.407 --> 00:34:08.175
We don't have any...

872
00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:10.978
No, we're good.
What's in it for us?


873
00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:12.346
Look, we're the FBI.

874
00:34:12.413 --> 00:34:14.215
We've got all
the high-tech shit.


875
00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:17.852
Cameras, audio equipment.
You name it, we've got it.


876
00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:19.220
How about a wire for her?

877
00:34:19.286 --> 00:34:21.022
- Yeah.
- Yup.


878
00:34:21.088 --> 00:34:22.857
Yeah, let's wire her up.

879
00:34:22.924 --> 00:34:24.759
- Working with the FBI! Whoo!
- Sweet.


880
00:34:24.826 --> 00:34:26.427
And CIA. Hi.

881
00:34:26.493 --> 00:34:28.562
Come in.

882
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:30.431
Oh.

883
00:34:30.497 --> 00:34:32.366
Hello, patriot.

884
00:34:32.433 --> 00:34:35.837
Hello, my cool ranch
Kate Winslet.


885
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.373
How are you? Mwah.

886
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.918
Oh, I love that you
left your shoes on.


887
00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:42.176
Oh, well, you know,

888
00:34:42.243 --> 00:34:43.811
you got to have
a couple of things


889
00:34:43.878 --> 00:34:46.047
to throw off later.

890
00:34:46.113 --> 00:34:47.314
I love a stakeout.

891
00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:48.783
- It's the best.
- It's the best.


892
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.084
Good just... good coffee.

893
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:52.419
You get to smoke in a tiny room.

894
00:34:52.486 --> 00:34:54.221
I know it's a little
on the nose, but,


895
00:34:54.288 --> 00:34:56.357
man, if we had, like,
old Chinese takeout,


896
00:34:56.423 --> 00:34:57.935
wouldn't that be amazing?
Oh! Takeout.


897
00:34:57.959 --> 00:34:59.360
Yeah, yeah, that's...
That's good.


898
00:34:59.426 --> 00:35:01.262
We're gonna get this guy.

899
00:35:01.328 --> 00:35:03.006
Hope you don't mind
that I didn't make the bed.


900
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.665
I didn't want to try
to hide the lie


901
00:35:04.732 --> 00:35:07.068
that I had been tossing
and turning


902
00:35:07.134 --> 00:35:08.369
and thinking of you.

903
00:35:08.435 --> 00:35:09.937
Because I have been.

904
00:35:10.004 --> 00:35:11.472
Well, great.

905
00:35:11.538 --> 00:35:13.107
It smells so masculine in here.

906
00:35:13.174 --> 00:35:16.043
Oh, well, that is the spicy
cheese puffs.


907
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.013
And if you're thirsty,
the clam lite lime.


908
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.515
- Oh.
- I would, uh, open one,


909
00:35:21.582 --> 00:35:23.484
but I'm, um...

910
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.253
The clam lime kind of,
you know...


911
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.722
it's a kind of rush hour deal
right through me, so...


912
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.324
Oh, as someone who has had

913
00:35:30.391 --> 00:35:34.228
the clam lite lime
splatter shits before,


914
00:35:34.295 --> 00:35:37.498
believe me, I shat my underwear
right off one time.


915
00:35:37.564 --> 00:35:39.266
Oh, um, sorry,

916
00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:41.869
but vocalization leads to
visualization,


917
00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:43.237
leads to realization.

918
00:35:43.304 --> 00:35:44.872
Be right back in a second.
Okay.


919
00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:46.049
I'm just gonna
leave the door open


920
00:35:46.073 --> 00:35:47.408
and talk to you from here.

921
00:35:47.474 --> 00:35:49.343
Great, I have no problem
with that at all.


922
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.678
So seriously,
thanks for coming...


923
00:35:53.147 --> 00:35:56.650
Uh, to just, you know,
I guess hang out and talk.


924
00:35:56.717 --> 00:36:02.423
Most people... it's really rare
when a woman comes into my room.


925
00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:04.025
I don't believe that.

926
00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:06.627
You strike me as quite the lad...

927
00:36:06.693 --> 00:36:07.962
Lady-killer. Oh.

928
00:36:09.763 --> 00:36:11.165
I wish I had some of those...

929
00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:14.235
What are those matches
with the kind of...


930
00:36:14.301 --> 00:36:16.203
Anyway, I just think
you're really pretty.


931
00:36:18.705 --> 00:36:20.174
- And...
- So do I.


932
00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:22.376
And that's something
we have in common, Ron.


933
00:36:22.443 --> 00:36:24.111
It's like we were
talking about earlier.


934
00:36:24.178 --> 00:36:28.082
Just, you know,
feeling so alone and, like,


935
00:36:28.149 --> 00:36:30.284
there's no one you can...

936
00:36:30.351 --> 00:36:32.119
I hear it. I hear it. Go.

937
00:36:32.186 --> 00:36:33.864
- Oh, okay, okay.
- It's fine. Yeah, I hear it.


938
00:36:33.888 --> 00:36:35.756
Wait, wait, wait.

939
00:36:35.823 --> 00:36:37.324
This'll be...
This'll be a quick one.


940
00:36:37.391 --> 00:36:38.951
- Yeah?
- Yeah, just a little quick jet.


941
00:36:38.993 --> 00:36:40.494
A little quick jet! Oh!

942
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:42.729
She should be getting
extra combat pay.


943
00:36:42.796 --> 00:36:44.765
Whoo!
That one had a bone in it.


944
00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:48.936
Tell me some things, Ron.

945
00:36:49.003 --> 00:36:51.939
You have such a way about you.

946
00:36:52.006 --> 00:36:53.474
I...

947
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.377
I bet you have a lot of...

948
00:36:56.443 --> 00:37:00.547
secrets, maybe,
that people don't understand.


949
00:37:01.883 --> 00:37:03.443
Actually hitting the nail
on the head.


950
00:37:03.484 --> 00:37:04.986
I...

951
00:37:05.052 --> 00:37:06.720
I mean...

952
00:37:06.787 --> 00:37:08.722
in a way,

953
00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:11.825
I am a secret.

954
00:37:11.893 --> 00:37:13.995
Forget... nothing, nothing.
Forget I said that.


955
00:37:14.061 --> 00:37:15.429
I...

956
00:37:15.496 --> 00:37:16.630
Go on.

957
00:37:16.697 --> 00:37:18.032
I'm listening.

958
00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:19.766
I'm here for whatever
you want to say.


959
00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:22.636
And this will just stay
between us?


960
00:37:22.703 --> 00:37:24.371
Obviously.

961
00:37:24.438 --> 00:37:27.274
Because I don't think
I ever want to leave your side.


962
00:37:31.112 --> 00:37:33.214
Right now...

963
00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:35.950
You

964
00:37:36.017 --> 00:37:38.119
are scratching the back...

965
00:37:39.686 --> 00:37:40.686
Of Q.

966
00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:42.023
I'm Q.

967
00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:43.557
He's Q.

968
00:37:43.624 --> 00:37:45.559
- This guy's Q?
- This guy's Q. He's Q.


969
00:37:45.626 --> 00:37:47.828
- This is Q.
- Shit. Go!


970
00:37:47.895 --> 00:37:49.072
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.


971
00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:50.464
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

972
00:37:53.034 --> 00:37:55.336
Here's to butt stuff.

973
00:37:55.402 --> 00:37:57.171
- Always.
- Mm.


974
00:37:58.305 --> 00:38:00.207
- Freeze! Freeze!
- Freeze! Police!


975
00:38:00.274 --> 00:38:02.944
Pizza Midget says hello!

976
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.111
Fuck you, deep state!

977
00:38:05.479 --> 00:38:07.281
- Oh, my...
- Get him!


978
00:38:07.348 --> 00:38:09.083
No, after you.

979
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.360
- Let me lick it!
- No, don't lick it!


980
00:38:10.384 --> 00:38:11.618
Jesus Christ! Get him off me!

981
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.622
Freeze!

982
00:38:15.689 --> 00:38:17.091
Hey! Hey! Hey!

983
00:38:17.158 --> 00:38:18.292
Don't you move...

984
00:38:21.028 --> 00:38:22.896
You're not canceling me!

985
00:38:22.964 --> 00:38:24.431
He's getting away!

986
00:38:29.436 --> 00:38:31.939
Out of my way, lib-tards!

987
00:38:32.006 --> 00:38:34.441
- Get one of the...
- Junior, Junior! Shit!


988
00:38:34.508 --> 00:38:36.710
- What's happening?
- Uh, okay, uh,


989
00:38:36.777 --> 00:38:38.079
what do you do?

990
00:38:38.145 --> 00:38:40.181
You push the red thing!
You push the red thing!


991
00:38:40.247 --> 00:38:42.183
Where's the red thing?

992
00:38:42.249 --> 00:38:44.585
Hold on, guys.
Hold on, I got it.


993
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:48.055
Slow and steady wins the race.

994
00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:50.557
Ow!

995
00:38:50.624 --> 00:38:52.226
Freeze, you little weirdo!

996
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.129
It's okay, guys!

997
00:38:55.196 --> 00:38:57.431
I'll just use my getaway sticks.

998
00:38:57.498 --> 00:38:59.200
- Here she comes.
- The jig is up.


999
00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:00.667
We know you're Q, guy.

1000
00:39:00.734 --> 00:39:03.304
Q is bigger than me!
Q is bigger than all of this!


1001
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.006
I got a shot! I got a shot!

1002
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.850
Sorry, undercover deputies
working on behalf


1003
00:39:07.874 --> 00:39:10.544
of Pizza Midget.
Sorry, we have badges, I swear.


1004
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.249
Help me, Roger Stone!

1005
00:39:16.617 --> 00:39:18.919
Don't shoot the food, Dangle!

1006
00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:23.290
Oh!

1007
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.262
- Hey! Hey!
- I got him!


1008
00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:29.896
Ha! Go, go, go, go!

1009
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.972
Freeze! Sheriff's Department!

1010
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.774
I'm coming for you, my love!

1011
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:43.944
Ron, over here!

1012
00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:46.413
You'll never catch Q!

1013
00:39:55.422 --> 00:39:57.258
You've been served.

1014
00:39:59.093 --> 00:40:02.263
I'm gonna blog so hard
about this on my Reddit thread.


1015
00:40:08.302 --> 00:40:11.505
That is how you do it.

1016
00:40:11.572 --> 00:40:15.309
Clemmie, is your clam-nado lime
disagreeing with you?


1017
00:40:15.376 --> 00:40:17.344
It's just not taking me
where I want to go.


1018
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:19.213
Oh, God, that's so hot.

1019
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.447
You did great, kid.

1020
00:40:20.514 --> 00:40:23.050
Then why do I feel so shitty?

1021
00:40:23.117 --> 00:40:25.886
Maybe part of you is sad
just because he's so gross.


1022
00:40:25.952 --> 00:40:27.188
He's so gross,

1023
00:40:27.254 --> 00:40:29.290
and you've had a lot
of clam-nado lime now.


1024
00:40:29.356 --> 00:40:30.724
It's probably just that.

1025
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:32.369
When I was feeling
mixed up and confused,


1026
00:40:32.393 --> 00:40:34.528
which I did a lot,

1027
00:40:34.595 --> 00:40:38.865
my Uncle Frederick
used to sing me


1028
00:40:38.932 --> 00:40:42.269
a little song that went
just like this.


1029
00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:02.923
♫ She dashed by me
in painted-on jeans ♫


1030
00:41:06.827 --> 00:41:11.432
♫ And all heads turned
'cause she was a dream ♫


1031
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:15.936
♫ In the blink of an eye ♫

1032
00:41:16.002 --> 00:41:19.173
♫ I knew her number
and her name ♫


1033
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.243
♫ Yeah ♫

1034
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:23.744
♫ She said I was the tiger ♫

1035
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:28.349
♫ She wanted to tame ♫

1036
00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:30.617
♫ Caribbean Queen ♫

1037
00:41:30.684 --> 00:41:34.655

the same dream ♫

♫ No more love on the run ♫

1040
00:41:46.032 --> 00:41:49.403
♫ I lose my cool
when she steps in the room ♫


1041
00:41:53.707 --> 00:41:58.245
♫ And I get so excited
just from her perfume ♫


1042
00:41:58.312 --> 00:42:00.147
♫ She smells good ♫

1043
00:42:01.882 --> 00:42:05.452
♫ Electric eyes
that you can't ignore ♫


1044
00:42:08.155 --> 00:42:09.723
♫ Hey, ow! ♫

1051

Yeah!

1068
00:43:49.222 --> 00:43:50.491
That's great.

1069
00:43:50.557 --> 00:43:52.158
I hate to break up
whatever this is,


1070
00:43:52.225 --> 00:43:54.761
but, uh, Ron is not Q.

1071
00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:57.864
He's a gym instructor
from Fresno.


1072
00:43:57.931 --> 00:44:01.335
I guess Arby's has, like,
a restraining order against him.


1073
00:44:01.402 --> 00:44:03.103
- That's it.
- Sorry, guys.


1074
00:44:03.169 --> 00:44:04.805
Sorry.

1075
00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:10.387
One more time from the top?

1076
00:44:14.581 --> 00:44:18.552
The ship has officially
run out of toilet paper.


1077
00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:20.854
Please use your assigned towel.

1078
00:44:20.921 --> 00:44:22.756
I can't believe I played
stinky pinkie


1079
00:44:22.823 --> 00:44:24.458
with someone who wasn't Q.

1080
00:44:24.525 --> 00:44:26.827
Oh, okay.

1081
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:35.235
I hear steel drums.

1082
00:44:35.302 --> 00:44:38.972
I smell coconuts.

1083
00:44:39.039 --> 00:44:41.207
- Oh! We're in Nassau.
- Whoo!


1084
00:44:41.274 --> 00:44:42.609
We're in Nassau!

1085
00:44:50.717 --> 00:44:52.719
Nassau! Nassau! Nassau!

1086
00:44:52.786 --> 00:44:54.988
Nassau! Nassau!

1087
00:44:55.055 --> 00:44:57.157
Okay, everybody!

1088
00:44:57.223 --> 00:45:00.427
Please, attention.
Open your orejas, please.


1089
00:45:00.494 --> 00:45:03.096
I have some bad news.

1090
00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:07.501
I have just been told that we
have a super strain of diarrhea.


1091
00:45:07.568 --> 00:45:10.371
The worst diarrhea known to man.

1092
00:45:10.437 --> 00:45:11.972
No one can dock in Nassau.

1093
00:45:12.038 --> 00:45:14.007
We are officially quarantined
here.


1094
00:45:14.074 --> 00:45:15.308
- What?
- No, no, no, no.


1095
00:45:15.376 --> 00:45:17.578
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mr. Memes.


1096
00:45:17.644 --> 00:45:18.788
We've been bubbled
this whole time.


1097
00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:20.056
You are not keeping us
on this ship!


1098
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.015
We have already had
the worst diarrhea!


1099
00:45:22.082 --> 00:45:24.184
We're a pod. We're fine.
We're going. Good day.


1100
00:45:31.692 --> 00:45:35.161
Nobody,
absolutely zero people,


1101
00:45:35.228 --> 00:45:37.598
will be able to leave this boat.

1102
00:45:37.664 --> 00:45:39.299
All right, you guys,

1103
00:45:39.366 --> 00:45:40.934
enjoy your search for Q.

1104
00:45:41.001 --> 00:45:42.436
- Bye, guys.
- Thank you!


1105
00:45:42.503 --> 00:45:43.904
That's a sad look.

1106
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.648
Except for these guys.
They have to leave.


1107
00:45:45.672 --> 00:45:47.240
Hey, Asians, Hispanic dude.

1108
00:45:47.307 --> 00:45:48.809
Uh-oh. Oh, oh...

1109
00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:51.144
- As minorities...
- That's it, that's it.


1110
00:45:51.211 --> 00:45:53.480
We need to stick together,
all right?


1111
00:45:53.547 --> 00:45:54.781
You know what I'm saying?

1112
00:45:54.848 --> 00:45:58.151
Like, if my back can wash yours,

1113
00:45:58.218 --> 00:46:01.121
then maybe you
can wash mine, right?


1114
00:46:01.187 --> 00:46:04.558
Yeah, man, me and my boy here,

1115
00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:06.026
we just like to party
up in the...


1116
00:46:06.092 --> 00:46:07.528
No! No!

1117
00:46:07.594 --> 00:46:09.696
- No?
- No, no.


1118
00:46:09.763 --> 00:46:13.534
So how many days
are we gonna be quarantined?


1119
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.303
Just a short, happy 30 days.

1120
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.371
What?

1121
00:46:35.288 --> 00:46:37.458
- I got it. Let go!
- No!


1122
00:46:37.524 --> 00:46:40.461
No! No!

1123
00:46:55.942 --> 00:46:58.078
I know you're watching me.

1124
00:46:58.144 --> 00:46:59.913
I know you know
I'm watching you.


1125
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.615
I know you know I knew it.

1126
00:47:03.817 --> 00:47:05.919
Okay, bye-bye. Go.

1127
00:47:07.187 --> 00:47:09.723
That's all you get.
Use front, use back.


1128
00:47:20.033 --> 00:47:21.434
- Hey, Travis...
- Huh?


1129
00:47:21.502 --> 00:47:22.982
Why are you doing
all those so fast?


1130
00:47:24.437 --> 00:47:27.741
- Toilet paper, Boss.
- Thank you very much.


1131
00:47:27.808 --> 00:47:29.309
How long we been quarantined?

1132
00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:30.744
Almost a half-hour.

1133
00:47:41.054 --> 00:47:42.455
Well, look at you.

1134
00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.392
Nice to see you again,
Clemmie,


1135
00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.194
or should I say, "officer."

1136
00:47:48.261 --> 00:47:50.564
Well, it's not nice
to see you again,


1137
00:47:50.631 --> 00:47:52.499
you star-spangled turd.

1138
00:47:52.566 --> 00:47:53.667
Oh, really?

1139
00:47:53.734 --> 00:47:56.770
The liar is offended
to see me again.


1140
00:47:56.837 --> 00:48:00.974
I lied, but you should
expect that from a girl.


1141
00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:03.176
You said you were Q,

1142
00:48:03.243 --> 00:48:06.012
and that's a lot worse,
and I am so disappointed.


1143
00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:07.347
When a...

1144
00:48:07.413 --> 00:48:09.650
A goddess like you
shows any bit of interest,


1145
00:48:09.716 --> 00:48:11.484
of course I'm gonna lie.

1146
00:48:11.552 --> 00:48:14.788
I know you didn't ask to be
this gorgeous and this perfect,


1147
00:48:14.855 --> 00:48:16.456
but you have to be ready

1148
00:48:16.523 --> 00:48:19.960
for guys to do stuff like this
sometimes, okay?


1149
00:48:21.094 --> 00:48:22.829
I am very interested

1150
00:48:22.896 --> 00:48:24.731
in the goddess part
of what you were saying.


1151
00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:26.099
It doesn't matter.

1152
00:48:26.166 --> 00:48:27.343
I should have known
that you were a mirage.


1153
00:48:27.367 --> 00:48:28.927
I don't know if you can
understand this,


1154
00:48:28.969 --> 00:48:32.038
but my whole life
I felt like I am stuck


1155
00:48:32.105 --> 00:48:35.609
in this disgusting,
low-rent desert,


1156
00:48:35.676 --> 00:48:38.812
and I'm the only one
with any real inner beauty


1157
00:48:38.879 --> 00:48:40.647
and any actual dreams.

1158
00:48:40.714 --> 00:48:43.083
And I just want to rise up

1159
00:48:43.149 --> 00:48:46.953
like the burning eagle god
that I am.


1160
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.755
Can you understand that at all?

1161
00:48:48.822 --> 00:48:51.291
Everything you just said

1162
00:48:51.357 --> 00:48:54.027
is everything
that I have written


1163
00:48:54.094 --> 00:48:56.963
in my own Akashic records.

1164
00:48:58.599 --> 00:48:59.733
Oh!

1165
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:06.372
- Oh! Ah! Ah!
- Oh, yeah!


1166
00:49:11.712 --> 00:49:14.114
That was incredible.

1167
00:49:15.381 --> 00:49:17.083
- I'll bet it was.
- Yeah.


1168
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.552
I admire your efficiency.

1169
00:49:21.655 --> 00:49:25.525
You know, only three men
have ever seen my labia before.


1170
00:49:25.592 --> 00:49:29.229
One was my ex-husband,
one was my pediatrician,


1171
00:49:29.295 --> 00:49:31.765
and the other
was an ambulance driver.


1172
00:49:31.832 --> 00:49:35.068
So consider yourself very lucky.

1173
00:49:35.135 --> 00:49:36.436
Proud to be number four.

1174
00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:40.506
I am tormented by your beauty.

1175
00:49:40.573 --> 00:49:42.809
Mm, can I take this
out of my mouth...


1176
00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:44.544
- Not yet.
- Okay.


1177
00:49:44.611 --> 00:49:46.412
Just finishing the shading

1178
00:49:46.479 --> 00:49:50.751
around your beautiful face
and pubis.


1179
00:49:50.817 --> 00:49:53.019
I'm gonna need a lot of
shading,


1180
00:49:53.086 --> 00:49:55.055
FYI, for the pubis area,

1181
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.390
because one thing they don't
tell you in health class


1182
00:49:57.457 --> 00:50:01.561
is that your pubis does get
a lot bigger the older you get,


1183
00:50:01.628 --> 00:50:03.664
and I'm not bragging.

1184
00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:06.271
Almost done with the shading.

1185
00:50:06.299 --> 00:50:07.734
How does my butthole look?

1186
00:50:07.801 --> 00:50:08.935
Let me take a look.

1187
00:50:09.002 --> 00:50:12.072
A little more pink.

1188
00:50:12.138 --> 00:50:14.841
Hmm. You flatter me.

1189
00:50:14.908 --> 00:50:16.576
Relax the face.

1190
00:50:17.978 --> 00:50:20.613
And relax the anus.

1191
00:50:22.048 --> 00:50:23.750
Yes. Perfect.

1192
00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:29.089
You know,

1193
00:50:29.155 --> 00:50:32.058
after being inside of you
for two seconds like that,


1194
00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:35.028
I just feel
so much closer to you.


1195
00:50:35.095 --> 00:50:37.530
I feel like I'm a part
of you now.


1196
00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:39.599
And I...

1197
00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:42.135
I would never ask this,

1198
00:50:42.202 --> 00:50:46.039
but I feel so comfortable
with you.


1199
00:50:46.106 --> 00:50:48.174
What's your real name?

1200
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.013
It's kind of embarrassing.

1201
00:50:54.915 --> 00:50:58.952
Clementine Anne Johnson.

1202
00:50:59.019 --> 00:51:00.353
Clementine?

1203
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.924
You mean like the sweet
nibbly cookie?


1204
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:07.627
I'd say that's perfect for you.

1205
00:51:07.694 --> 00:51:09.254
Well, I never thought of it
like that.


1206
00:51:10.263 --> 00:51:12.766
But that makes sense.

1207
00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:15.368
You know...

1208
00:51:15.435 --> 00:51:16.602
I'm not really Q.

1209
00:51:16.669 --> 00:51:18.271
I'm his right-hand man.

1210
00:51:18.338 --> 00:51:21.474
In a lot of ways,
I'm his mouthpiece.


1211
00:51:21.541 --> 00:51:25.578
I deliver his messages,
and sometimes...


1212
00:51:28.148 --> 00:51:31.051
I invent some of those messages.

1213
00:51:31.117 --> 00:51:33.653
Just the stuff like, you know,

1214
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.089
Britney Spears
is really Lee Harvey Oswald.


1215
00:51:36.156 --> 00:51:37.476
- And, you know...
- That was you?


1216
00:51:37.523 --> 00:51:39.492
Yeah, that was me. Yeah.

1217
00:51:39.559 --> 00:51:42.162
Yes, there's a bit
of a thrill of, you know,


1218
00:51:42.228 --> 00:51:45.198
being able to kind of control
the zeitgeist,


1219
00:51:45.265 --> 00:51:51.204
but the lifestyle
is fucking amazing.


1220
00:51:51.271 --> 00:51:55.441
We own Jeffrey Epstein's
old island.


1221
00:51:55.508 --> 00:51:57.510
It has a secret bunker
underneath it.


1222
00:51:57.577 --> 00:52:02.048
It has a food court with every
discontinued fast-food chain.


1223
00:52:02.115 --> 00:52:03.817
Kenny Rogers Roasters,
Burger Chef;


1224
00:52:03.884 --> 00:52:06.887
they're all in operation,
only at that one food court.


1225
00:52:06.953 --> 00:52:08.521
Go fuck yourself.

1226
00:52:08.588 --> 00:52:10.256
Yeah.

1227
00:52:10.323 --> 00:52:12.158
You know what I find crazy,
Xavier?


1228
00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:13.459
You're a painter.

1229
00:52:13.526 --> 00:52:15.862
I make dolls
out of my old pantyhose,


1230
00:52:15.929 --> 00:52:17.330
so we're both artists.

1231
00:52:17.397 --> 00:52:20.767
And we randomly meet on a cruise
and fall in love


1232
00:52:20.834 --> 00:52:22.735
on the exact day

1233
00:52:22.803 --> 00:52:25.671
that I run out of
my anti-psychotic medication.


1234
00:52:25.738 --> 00:52:28.508
I mean, if that's not kismet,
I don't know what is.


1235
00:52:28.574 --> 00:52:29.675
Perfect timing.

1236
00:52:31.812 --> 00:52:33.679
Wiegel!

1237
00:52:33.746 --> 00:52:35.148
Wiegel, you're naked.

1238
00:52:35.215 --> 00:52:37.283
I know that.
I'm being painted.


1239
00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:38.684
- What?
- Please leave us alone.


1240
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:41.321
Wiegel, Wiegel,
you are naked in the buffet.


1241
00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:44.825
Can we please
have some privacy?


1242
00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:47.060
Your friend cannot be naked
in the buffet.


1243
00:52:47.127 --> 00:52:49.129
- I know.
- We have a sign that says so.


1244
00:52:49.195 --> 00:52:50.639
You'd think we don't
need a sign that says,


1245
00:52:50.663 --> 00:52:53.133
"Please do not be naked
in the buffet," but we do.


1246
00:52:53.199 --> 00:52:54.576
- I see it.
- This is a diarrhea nightmare.


1247
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.870
I apologize. Trudy, please.

1248
00:52:56.937 --> 00:52:59.906
Don't listen to him, Trudy.
It's just you and I.


1249
00:52:59.973 --> 00:53:01.674
Don't worry, sugar balls.

1250
00:53:01.741 --> 00:53:04.210
I only have ears for you.

1251
00:53:04.277 --> 00:53:05.611
Trudy, that's a plant.

1252
00:53:05.678 --> 00:53:07.613
God, you look so beautiful
right now.


1253
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.949
Come back, Trudy.

1254
00:53:09.015 --> 00:53:10.015
Come back!

1255
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.085
Your jealousy is gross.

1256
00:53:12.152 --> 00:53:13.753
Trudy!

1257
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:19.926
♫ ♫

1258
00:53:19.993 --> 00:53:21.794
Morning, gang.

1259
00:53:21.862 --> 00:53:23.429
- Morning.
- Morning.


1260
00:53:23.496 --> 00:53:25.765
I know it hasn't been ideal...

1261
00:53:25.832 --> 00:53:28.401
If you haven't filled out
your diarrhea app,


1262
00:53:28.468 --> 00:53:30.670
do so immediately.

1263
00:53:30.736 --> 00:53:34.674
Failure to do so will result
in a very serious penalty.


1264
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.443
Remember, message
and data rates may apply.


1265
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:41.247
Raise your hand if you forgot
to log your diarrhea today.


1266
00:53:41.314 --> 00:53:43.316
I didn't forget,
but I tried and it crashed.


1267
00:53:43.383 --> 00:53:44.784
Almost everyone!

1268
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:46.920
When I say, "hell,"
you say, "o."


1269
00:53:46.987 --> 00:53:49.289
Hello! Hello.

1270
00:53:49.355 --> 00:53:53.093
I just got off of the phone
with the doctors


1271
00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:55.295
from the ship and the mainland,

1272
00:53:55.361 --> 00:53:58.564
and I am now certifiably insane.

1273
00:53:58.631 --> 00:54:00.200
They actually used the word...

1274
00:54:00.266 --> 00:54:02.168
And I never heard a doctor say
this before...


1275
00:54:02.235 --> 00:54:04.570
Cat shit crazy.

1276
00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:07.273
So I don't want to say
screw all of you,


1277
00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.043
so I will say fuck all of you.

1278
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.411
Fuck the ship life.

1279
00:54:11.477 --> 00:54:13.880
This jacket was
my grandfather's.


1280
00:54:13.947 --> 00:54:15.949
They took it off his cold body.

1281
00:54:16.016 --> 00:54:17.283
He wasn't dead yet.

1282
00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.219
You can have that.
Take that for you.


1283
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:23.056
Oh!

1284
00:54:23.123 --> 00:54:25.325
Oh!

1285
00:54:25.391 --> 00:54:26.559
Big son of a...

1286
00:54:26.626 --> 00:54:27.669
I think this is cause
for concern.


1287
00:54:27.693 --> 00:54:29.963
Oh!

1288
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.664
How come he hasn't got
diarrhea?


1289
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.636
- Okay, everybody.
- Yes?


1290
00:54:36.702 --> 00:54:38.304
Calm down. All calm down.

1291
00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:40.531
Why did you say "calm down"?
We were relatively calm.


1292
00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:46.412
We were calm!

1293
00:54:46.479 --> 00:54:48.481
As you can see,

1294
00:54:48.548 --> 00:54:51.451
the captain has gone
a little bit crazy.


1295
00:54:51.517 --> 00:54:53.553
Certifiably cat shit crazy.

1296
00:54:53.619 --> 00:54:56.189
And since that is, you know,
he's a little cause for alarm,


1297
00:54:56.256 --> 00:54:57.423
I am taking over.

1298
00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.259
I am not taking orders

1299
00:54:59.325 --> 00:55:00.593
from another guy in shorts!

1300
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.196
- Pass. Hard pass.
- And you know what?


1301
00:55:03.263 --> 00:55:05.498
None of you updated
your MyDiarrhea app.


1302
00:55:05.565 --> 00:55:06.842
I did, though!
Except for not them!


1303
00:55:06.866 --> 00:55:08.334
But I actually did.

1304
00:55:08.401 --> 00:55:11.904
You are not taking the ship.
Thank you, but no thank you.


1305
00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:15.141
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1306
00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:17.010
- Put them below deck.
- Okay, okay, we'll go.


1307
00:55:17.077 --> 00:55:18.778
No. No. No. No.

1308
00:55:18.844 --> 00:55:19.980
Come on!

1309
00:55:20.046 --> 00:55:21.281
Oh, my God.

1310
00:55:21.347 --> 00:55:23.416
No. No, oh, my God!

1311
00:55:24.884 --> 00:55:28.254
Yes. Guns! Guns! Guns!
Guns! Guns!


1312
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:30.390
When I say "guns,"
you say, "mm!"


1313
00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:36.729
This is like that movie.

1314
00:55:38.531 --> 00:55:39.891
You know, the guy
with the glasses.


1315
00:55:41.667 --> 00:55:45.038
Come on, the one... Come on.

1316
00:55:45.105 --> 00:55:48.041
When you... the thing?

1317
00:55:48.108 --> 00:55:49.309
- "Amistad"?
- Yes.


1318
00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:51.011
How did you get that?

1319
00:55:51.077 --> 00:55:52.778
I'm sorry, don't do that.

1320
00:55:52.845 --> 00:55:55.648
Don't compare a slave ship
to what we're in.


1321
00:55:55.715 --> 00:55:57.350
How is this not
the exact same thing?


1322
00:55:57.417 --> 00:55:59.919
Black people still have
high blood pressure today


1323
00:55:59.986 --> 00:56:01.854
because of what happened.

1324
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:03.789
The salt was so...

1325
00:56:03.856 --> 00:56:05.691
Was that the name of
that movie, by the way?


1326
00:56:05.758 --> 00:56:07.436
Oh, don't make this
be like the whole thing


1327
00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.870
when he gives that
whole lecture about "Roots".


1328
00:56:08.894 --> 00:56:11.097
I'll be honest, if I was...

1329
00:56:11.164 --> 00:56:13.299
Hello, everyone.
This is your captain.


1330
00:56:13.366 --> 00:56:15.468
I hope you are having
a wonderful day.


1331
00:56:15.535 --> 00:56:17.703
It's a good day to die.

1332
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.306
Speaking of that, I'm about
to run this ship aground


1333
00:56:20.373 --> 00:56:22.075
and kill all of us.

1334
00:56:22.142 --> 00:56:24.310
Go! Go!

1335
00:56:24.377 --> 00:56:26.946
Whoa! Whoa!

1336
00:56:29.182 --> 00:56:30.583
- Everybody okay?
- Oh!


1337
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:32.285
Tell you right now, people...

1338
00:56:32.352 --> 00:56:35.421
Hands in.

1339
00:56:35.488 --> 00:56:40.026
Heroes are not made...

1340
00:56:40.093 --> 00:56:41.561
at a summer frolic,

1341
00:56:41.627 --> 00:56:45.265
at a picnic with a basket

1342
00:56:45.331 --> 00:56:48.134
of fruits, crudités,
cheeses, and meats.


1343
00:56:48.201 --> 00:56:49.402
What the fuck?

1344
00:56:49.469 --> 00:56:50.636
Maybe a sparkling white...

1345
00:56:50.703 --> 00:56:52.772
Hero... I'm getting to this part.

1346
00:56:52.838 --> 00:56:55.941
Heroes are forged

1347
00:56:56.008 --> 00:56:57.843
in fire.

1348
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.580
Yeah!

1349
00:57:00.646 --> 00:57:02.014
Let's do something about this!

1350
00:57:02.082 --> 00:57:03.549
Yes! What do we do?

1351
00:57:03.616 --> 00:57:04.826
Are we clowns, or are we the
Reno Sheriff's Department?


1352
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:06.952
We're the Reno Sheriff's
Department!


1353
00:57:17.897 --> 00:57:19.465
Go, go, go, go.

1354
00:57:31.544 --> 00:57:34.347
These decks is off-limits,
everybody.


1355
00:57:34.414 --> 00:57:35.781
Oh!

1356
00:57:38.918 --> 00:57:41.087
Hey, who did this?

1357
00:57:49.962 --> 00:57:51.931
Oh, God.

1358
00:57:51.997 --> 00:57:53.499
Right into the propeller.

1359
00:57:53.566 --> 00:57:55.668
He's all mixed up in there.

1360
00:57:55.735 --> 00:57:57.213
Circle of life.
Circle of life, right?


1361
00:57:57.237 --> 00:57:59.572
- In what way?
- Um, let's not get specific.


1362
00:57:59.639 --> 00:58:01.341
Let's... you know,
the circle of life.


1363
00:58:01.407 --> 00:58:02.684
Oh, shit,
we got to stop the boat.


1364
00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:04.177
- Go.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1365
00:58:08.381 --> 00:58:11.484
Let's go.

1366
00:58:11.551 --> 00:58:13.353
Captain!

1367
00:58:13.419 --> 00:58:14.654
Captain, we got to stop!

1368
00:58:16.456 --> 00:58:18.924
All right, step back,
step back!


1369
00:58:18.991 --> 00:58:20.560
Don't worry.

1370
00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:22.228
We do stuff like this
all the time.


1371
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:25.431
Sorry!

1372
00:58:25.498 --> 00:58:26.599
Don't do it! Don't do it!

1373
00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:28.100
You got to let us in!

1374
00:58:28.168 --> 00:58:29.335
How do we stop the ship?

1375
00:58:29.402 --> 00:58:31.471
What if we drop the anchor?

1376
00:58:31.537 --> 00:58:33.406
Yeah! Go, go, go!

1377
00:58:33.473 --> 00:58:36.276
What if we drop the anchor?

1378
00:58:36.342 --> 00:58:39.212
Use your lower body. On three.

1379
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.182
One, two...

1380
00:58:46.986 --> 00:58:48.354
I'm getting it!
I got a little bit!


1381
00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:49.722
I got something over here!

1382
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:51.233
Son of a bitch,
I had something over here.


1383
00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:53.068
Let's do it one more time,
'cause I have to admit,


1384
00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:55.495
I wasn't pulling at all.
I was just going, "Ah!"


1385
00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:57.997
Fulcrum.

1386
00:58:58.063 --> 00:58:59.399
Anything?

1387
00:58:59.465 --> 00:59:01.334
Yeah, I felt it move!
I felt it move!


1388
00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:02.568
I got something!

1389
00:59:05.238 --> 00:59:07.873
One, two, three.

1390
00:59:13.379 --> 00:59:15.215
Sometimes...

1391
00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:17.450
the best move

1392
00:59:17.517 --> 00:59:19.485
is to admit when you need help.

1393
00:59:19.552 --> 00:59:20.486
Help! Help!

1394
00:59:20.553 --> 00:59:21.854
Don't scream.

1395
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:23.423
Okay, no, scream, scream.

1396
00:59:23.489 --> 00:59:24.590
- Help!
- We need help!


1397
00:59:26.292 --> 00:59:27.660
Help!

1398
00:59:27.727 --> 00:59:30.463
My brothers and sisters
of color,


1399
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.633
Q weirdos who actually turned
out to be pretty nice folks,


1400
00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:37.637
America used to be great
'cause we did stuff together.


1401
00:59:37.703 --> 00:59:39.372
Let's do this together, guys.

1402
00:59:39.439 --> 00:59:40.606
And heave!

1403
00:59:43.809 --> 00:59:46.111
Heave! Heave! Heave!

1404
00:59:46.178 --> 00:59:50.816
Heave! And ho!

1405
00:59:50.883 --> 00:59:54.320
Yes!

1406
00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:59.425
Hey, guys...

1407
00:59:59.492 --> 01:00:01.193
we fucked up again.

1408
01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:02.438
Yeah, it's supposed to be
attached, right?


1409
01:00:02.462 --> 01:00:03.396
Yeah.

1410
01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:04.997
Captain!

1411
01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:06.632
Capitán.

1412
01:00:06.699 --> 01:00:08.634
Hey, listen!

1413
01:00:08.701 --> 01:00:11.604
I forgot, the crazy Black
captain "Bonofrise"


1414
01:00:11.671 --> 01:00:13.306
- gave me the keys!
- Oh, my God!


1415
01:00:13.373 --> 01:00:15.575
- Let's do it.
- Go, go, go!


1416
01:00:15.641 --> 01:00:17.877
So much better than violence.

1417
01:00:17.943 --> 01:00:19.178
Hey!

1418
01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.281
- Gentle. Gentle.
- Why don't you come on out?


1419
01:00:21.347 --> 01:00:23.015
Look what I got for you, huh?

1420
01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:24.950
Oh. Shall we?

1421
01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:26.185
Yes, we shall.

1422
01:00:26.252 --> 01:00:27.929
Great, I'm gonna maybe
turn the ship off.


1423
01:00:27.953 --> 01:00:29.322
I wish I'd known
you were here.


1424
01:00:29.389 --> 01:00:30.823
I would have let you in earlier.

1425
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.092
- We did it.
- Man, you're batshit crazy.


1426
01:00:33.158 --> 01:00:34.927
Hey! We did it!
We saved the ship!


1427
01:00:34.994 --> 01:00:37.062
- Whoo-hoo!
- Don't have to thank us.


1428
01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:38.731
Oh, shit!

1429
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:46.306
What? What?

1430
01:00:46.372 --> 01:00:47.740
Are you out?

1431
01:00:49.275 --> 01:00:50.843
No hard feelings, right?

1432
01:00:52.177 --> 01:00:55.715
Mutiny in international law
is very bad.


1433
01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:57.082
I mean, we could kill you.

1434
01:00:57.149 --> 01:00:59.685
But we're not gonna do that,
because we nice.


1435
01:00:59.752 --> 01:01:01.721
And we want a good
Tripadvisor review.


1436
01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:03.889
Five star, please.
Thank you so much.


1437
01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:05.491
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.


1438
01:01:05.558 --> 01:01:07.627
- Bye-bye, my love.
- Bye.


1439
01:01:07.693 --> 01:01:09.028
Goodbye, my dear.

1440
01:01:09.094 --> 01:01:10.596
I left one of my panty liners

1441
01:01:10.663 --> 01:01:12.231
under your pillow!

1442
01:01:12.298 --> 01:01:13.566
Who is she talking to?

1443
01:01:13.633 --> 01:01:15.335
I will wait for
you right here!


1444
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:17.036
Fully engorged!

1445
01:01:20.773 --> 01:01:23.443
Bye, bye!

1446
01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:33.629
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?


1447
01:01:33.653 --> 01:01:34.820
- Holy...
- Were you guys here


1448
01:01:34.887 --> 01:01:36.088
- the whole time?
- Oh, yeah.


1449
01:01:36.155 --> 01:01:38.524
We... we turned this
into our little, um...


1450
01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:40.259
excuse me, but fuck nest.

1451
01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:42.261
Ew!

1452
01:01:42.328 --> 01:01:45.164
This succubus has me
up to, like, eight seconds.


1453
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.533
Never lasted that long.
Congratulations.


1454
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.901
Nobody asked.

1455
01:01:48.968 --> 01:01:51.771
If I get into double digits,
this is the one.


1456
01:01:51.837 --> 01:01:54.440
I'll buy you an ice cream.

1457
01:01:54.507 --> 01:01:56.409
Oh!

1458
01:01:56.476 --> 01:01:58.210
No, no, no!

1459
01:01:58.277 --> 01:02:00.846
Oh, come on!

1460
01:02:00.913 --> 01:02:02.915
Just read the raft.
Read the raft, right?


1461
01:02:02.982 --> 01:02:06.452
Does anybody know, like,
which way we're even drifting?


1462
01:02:06.519 --> 01:02:08.120
That's the drinking gourd
up there.


1463
01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:09.689
The handle points
to the North Star.


1464
01:02:09.755 --> 01:02:13.693
I mean, if that really is
the drinking gourd, I mean...


1465
01:02:13.759 --> 01:02:15.060
I probably shouldn't say this,

1466
01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:17.129
about a hundred miles
north of here...


1467
01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:21.300
Sorry, dude.

1468
01:02:21.367 --> 01:02:23.803
But, uh, Q's headquarters

1469
01:02:23.869 --> 01:02:25.871
are on my friend's island.

1470
01:02:25.938 --> 01:02:27.773
My friend had a really nice
island with a...


1471
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.451
You know, a mansion
and a sex dungeon and...


1472
01:02:29.475 --> 01:02:31.411
Jeff Epstein.

1473
01:02:31.477 --> 01:02:33.746
Who else has an island
with a sex dungeon?


1474
01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:34.714
Okay, yeah, fine. Jeff
Epstein...


1475
01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.081
Well, David Copperfield.

1476
01:02:36.148 --> 01:02:37.016
- David Copperfield.
- Okay, yeah.


1477
01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:38.250
Well, how do we get there?

1478
01:02:38.317 --> 01:02:41.220
Did you say 100 miles
north of here?


1479
01:02:41.286 --> 01:02:43.556
Yeah. I mean,
I don't really know basic,


1480
01:02:43.623 --> 01:02:45.425
you know, boat craft or...

1481
01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:48.327
Whoa, what are you...

1482
01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:50.029
There's a couple guys
in the world


1483
01:02:50.095 --> 01:02:52.732
that could get you

1484
01:02:52.798 --> 01:02:55.134
by the stars.

1485
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.335
And one of them...

1486
01:02:56.402 --> 01:02:57.603
Harriet Tubman.

1487
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.639
Is James Ron Dangle,

1488
01:02:59.705 --> 01:03:02.107
United States Coast Guard.

1489
01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:03.976
I mean, discharged.
Asked to leave.


1490
01:03:04.043 --> 01:03:05.878
- You know the story.
Yeah, yeah.


1491
01:03:05.945 --> 01:03:07.225
- For sure.
- Well, wait, I mean,


1492
01:03:07.279 --> 01:03:08.690
have you all heard it?
'Cause I haven't...


1493
01:03:08.714 --> 01:03:09.991
- You don't need to...
- My and another fellow were


1494
01:03:10.015 --> 01:03:11.427
asked to leave the Coast Guard
on the same day.


1495
01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:13.052
Nah, we don't need to...

1496
01:03:13.118 --> 01:03:15.888
Jim, what are you gonna do?

1497
01:03:56.562 --> 01:03:59.364
Damn.

1498
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:02.702
I am so over all of it.

1499
01:04:02.768 --> 01:04:05.070
Trudy, stop slobbing on me.

1500
01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:07.206
I'm tired of looking
at Dangle's ass,


1501
01:04:07.272 --> 01:04:09.775
I'm hungry,
and it's all your fault, Jones.


1502
01:04:09.842 --> 01:04:12.077
- My fault?
- You found the Booze Cruise!


1503
01:04:12.144 --> 01:04:14.880
- My fault because I can type?
- Actually, Dangle booked it.


1504
01:04:14.947 --> 01:04:16.281
Dangle booked it.

1505
01:04:16.348 --> 01:04:17.883
Clemmie, it's you!

1506
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.861
You were the one who was
supposed to get information,


1507
01:04:19.885 --> 01:04:21.386
instead of having a fuck nest!

1508
01:04:21.453 --> 01:04:23.823
- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Don't you dare!


1509
01:04:23.889 --> 01:04:25.758
This is a love fort!

1510
01:04:25.825 --> 01:04:28.260
They're all just waiting to
turn on me!


1511
01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:29.562
They all know that it was...

1512
01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.463
Travis? Travis?

1513
01:04:31.531 --> 01:04:32.698
- Hey.
- Hey.


1514
01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:34.266
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, my God.


1515
01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:36.802
Oh, my God.

1516
01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:40.973
- Whoo!
- Oh, wow.


1517
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.474
You did it, Jim.

1518
01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:43.576
You did it.

1519
01:04:43.643 --> 01:04:45.745
Yeah! Yeah, Dangle.

1520
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:48.748
Followed the drinking gourd.

1521
01:04:48.814 --> 01:04:52.184
Welcome to, uh,
Jeffrey Epstein's island.


1522
01:04:52.251 --> 01:04:54.787
You are now all our prisoners,

1523
01:04:54.854 --> 01:04:58.457
and will be taken to trial
before Q!


1524
01:04:58.524 --> 01:05:00.325
What?

1525
01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:07.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

1526
01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:11.403
Clemmie, you're gonna need
to decide.


1527
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.172
Are you with me...
I'm with you, yes!


1528
01:05:13.238 --> 01:05:14.439
- Okay, good.
- Yes.


1529
01:05:14.506 --> 01:05:15.851
Do you want to yell
at the minions


1530
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.209
and tell them...
Oh, yeah, yeah.


1531
01:05:17.276 --> 01:05:19.912
Hey, minions,
you with the colorful face.


1532
01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:21.947
Take these losers away.

1533
01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:23.491
I'm sorry, but it's true.
You're all losers.


1534
01:05:23.515 --> 01:05:25.718
Take them away!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!


1535
01:05:25.785 --> 01:05:27.787
Search their cavities.

1536
01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:29.555
Someone has something, I swear.

1537
01:05:29.622 --> 01:05:31.256
Sorry, not sorry!

1538
01:05:33.693 --> 01:05:35.327
Oh! I love our lives.

1539
01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:36.696
Oh.

1540
01:05:51.543 --> 01:05:52.978
Hello?

1541
01:06:23.108 --> 01:06:24.810
I love the open concept.

1542
01:06:35.587 --> 01:06:37.256
I'm impressed, Sheriff.

1543
01:06:37.322 --> 01:06:39.191
I'm actually not the sheriff.

1544
01:06:39.258 --> 01:06:41.260
I'm Lieutenant James Ron Dangle,

1545
01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:42.561
Reno Sheriff's Department.

1546
01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:45.597
Also, uh, amateur puppeteer.
Almost went pro...


1547
01:06:49.902 --> 01:06:52.271
So are you Q?

1548
01:06:54.907 --> 01:06:58.377
Don't play stupid, Officer.

1549
01:06:58.443 --> 01:07:00.483
She's not playing.
That was a legitimate question.


1550
01:07:00.512 --> 01:07:02.682
She's really not the bright.

1551
01:07:02.748 --> 01:07:04.459
You should all be very happy
with yourselves.


1552
01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:07.219
No one else has ever gotten
this far.


1553
01:07:07.286 --> 01:07:11.924
So you came all this way
to find out who Q really is.


1554
01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:13.659
Yeah, that's right.

1555
01:07:13.726 --> 01:07:15.427
Well, I'll tell you.

1556
01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:20.232
Years ago, a ship wrecked
on this very island,


1557
01:07:20.299 --> 01:07:24.937
carrying a brilliant
and deranged professor.


1558
01:07:25.004 --> 01:07:26.305
That professor...

1559
01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:28.140
Was Q.

1560
01:07:28.207 --> 01:07:29.709
Died in the wreck.

1561
01:07:29.775 --> 01:07:30.976
Okay.

1562
01:07:31.043 --> 01:07:34.513
But we found this...

1563
01:07:34.579 --> 01:07:36.548
in the wreckage.

1564
01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.787
Uh, brother man, that...

1565
01:07:41.854 --> 01:07:42.854
That's a Speak & Spell.

1566
01:07:42.888 --> 01:07:44.389
Yes, it is.

1567
01:07:44.456 --> 01:07:46.458
Or, it was.

1568
01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.227
Time and providence,

1569
01:07:48.293 --> 01:07:50.629
and probably
saltwater corrosion,


1570
01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:55.000
has altered its programming...

1571
01:07:55.067 --> 01:07:56.736
imbuing it...

1572
01:07:56.802 --> 01:07:59.972
and I'm not sure if I'm using
the word "imbuing" correctly.


1573
01:08:00.039 --> 01:08:02.007
But it infused it...

1574
01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:04.176
- It infused it...
- Infused.


1575
01:08:04.243 --> 01:08:06.045
With a dynamic,
divine wisdom...


1576
01:08:06.111 --> 01:08:08.147
Oh. Yeah, okay.

1577
01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:11.483
That Q imparts
and we disseminate.


1578
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:13.052
Oh, I get it.

1579
01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:15.955
So you guys are just
batshit crazy.


1580
01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:17.489
Wait.

1581
01:08:17.556 --> 01:08:18.791
Listen.

1582
01:08:18.858 --> 01:08:20.926
- Hmm?
- And learn.


1583
01:08:30.635 --> 01:08:33.105
Oprah has bears.

1584
01:08:35.707 --> 01:08:37.109
Oprah has bears.

1585
01:08:37.176 --> 01:08:39.544
Oprah has bears!

1586
01:08:39.611 --> 01:08:41.680
Let it be known
that Oprah has bears.


1587
01:08:41.747 --> 01:08:43.949
Go to your mobile devices,

1588
01:08:44.016 --> 01:08:46.285
get the word out on 8chan.

1589
01:08:46.351 --> 01:08:48.053
This is a dumb, dumb question.

1590
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.890
This isn't how
the whole thing works, right?


1591
01:08:53.192 --> 01:08:55.294
- It is...
- It is, definitely.


1592
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.696
That's words, and then you...

1593
01:08:57.763 --> 01:08:59.331
put the words on an 8chan.

1594
01:08:59.398 --> 01:09:01.209
It actually checks out
more than I would have thought.


1595
01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:02.367
Yep.

1596
01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:04.669
The flu is from France.

1597
01:09:04.736 --> 01:09:08.107
It's true, because sometimes
the flu is from France.


1598
01:09:08.173 --> 01:09:10.575
But as often as not
it's not, actually.


1599
01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:13.012
Well, sometimes it is.

1600
01:09:13.078 --> 01:09:15.180
To the dungeon with them.

1601
01:09:15.247 --> 01:09:17.682
And go through the bunker.
It's faster.


1602
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:21.153
And tell Ron to set off
that bomb.


1603
01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.923
The big one that will destroy
the island.


1604
01:09:23.989 --> 01:09:25.224
Oh, my God!

1605
01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.802
We will not...
You do not have to kill us!


1606
01:09:26.826 --> 01:09:29.094
You do not have to kill us!

1607
01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:31.030
- Go, go, go, go.
- We won't remember!


1608
01:09:31.096 --> 01:09:32.764
- Come on.
- Blow them up.


1609
01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:36.068
Can I just ask you
where you got that rag?


1610
01:09:36.135 --> 01:09:37.469
Walmart.

1611
01:09:37.536 --> 01:09:39.471
That's nice...
That's real nice.


1612
01:09:39.538 --> 01:09:42.307
Clever, clever interlopers.

1613
01:09:42.374 --> 01:09:43.675
We're not clever!

1614
01:09:43.742 --> 01:09:44.944
Ow! Ow!

1615
01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:46.311
Oh, hey, hey, ho!

1616
01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:51.150
Sorry, I'm just a little
excited right now.


1617
01:09:51.216 --> 01:09:52.818
I've, uh...

1618
01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:54.319
I've always wanted a monologue,

1619
01:09:54.386 --> 01:09:58.790
a secret fortress with
a smoking-hot vixen next to me.


1620
01:09:58.858 --> 01:10:00.559
You do look hot, Clemmie.

1621
01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:02.327
- You look rad.
- Damn!


1622
01:10:02.394 --> 01:10:03.604
The whole thing.
Show the whole thing.


1623
01:10:03.628 --> 01:10:06.265
- Look at that. Oh!
- Yes, queen!


1624
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.699
- Work!
- Work.


1625
01:10:07.766 --> 01:10:10.045
Marlene Dietrich in the front,
Stevie Nicks in the back.


1626
01:10:10.069 --> 01:10:11.470
Oh.

1627
01:10:11.536 --> 01:10:13.438
We've got the whole
nerve center here,


1628
01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:16.175
feeding all the greatest hits
into the algorithm.


1629
01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:18.443
You know,
the standard conspiracies.


1630
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:21.813
Moon landing faked,
pumpkins aren't real,


1631
01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:23.448
Joe Rogan is a hologram.

1632
01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:27.552
The, uh, gluten-free diet,
um, causes levitation.


1633
01:10:27.619 --> 01:10:30.589
Um, that's a really good one.
Great work.


1634
01:10:30.655 --> 01:10:33.258
Now, of course,
that you've, uh...


1635
01:10:33.325 --> 01:10:35.294
seen all of this,

1636
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.762
I have to blow it up.

1637
01:10:37.829 --> 01:10:40.065
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!


1638
01:10:42.234 --> 01:10:43.735
- Silence!
- I'm out!


1639
01:10:43.802 --> 01:10:48.240
A bomb this exquisite
can only be set in motion


1640
01:10:48.307 --> 01:10:50.609
by somebody as exquisite.

1641
01:10:50.675 --> 01:10:52.487
Clemmie, what about all those
great times that we had?


1642
01:10:52.511 --> 01:10:53.955
Remember all those
great times we had?


1643
01:10:53.979 --> 01:10:55.080
Suck it, monkeys.

1644
01:10:56.615 --> 01:10:58.884
- Hey, cut it out.
- Hey!


1645
01:10:58.951 --> 01:11:00.519
Hey, now, Clemmie.

1646
01:11:00.585 --> 01:11:01.887
- Oh!
- Come on now.


1647
01:11:01.954 --> 01:11:03.188
Oh!

1648
01:11:03.255 --> 01:11:05.657
Anyway, we would love
to stick around,


1649
01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:07.592
but we have to, um,

1650
01:11:07.659 --> 01:11:09.261
pack up a lot of money
and pills, right?


1651
01:11:09.328 --> 01:11:10.795
- Money and pills.
- Money and pills.


1652
01:11:10.862 --> 01:11:12.731
Glenn, to the dungeon.

1653
01:11:16.969 --> 01:11:18.603
No, no, no, no, no!

1654
01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:20.172
No!

1655
01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:23.308
Is this the first time you've
had hour friends blown up?


1656
01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:25.877
It's hard the first time,
but it gets easier.


1657
01:11:25.945 --> 01:11:27.022
- Does it?
- It really does.


1658
01:11:27.046 --> 01:11:28.046
Trust me, sweetie.

1659
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.616
But, really, what were they
gonna live for?


1660
01:11:31.683 --> 01:11:33.152
Nothing.

1661
01:11:33.218 --> 01:11:35.220
- Sir?
- Is there gonna be, like,


1662
01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:37.189
snacks or anything?

1663
01:11:37.256 --> 01:11:38.991
Appeal to his humanity.
Glenn, was it?


1664
01:11:39.058 --> 01:11:40.292
- Glenn?
- Hey, Glenn.


1665
01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:43.428
Oh, I have an itch!
I have an itch!


1666
01:11:43.495 --> 01:11:45.630
Is it bad that I feel like

1667
01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:47.933
I'm being threatened
with a good time?


1668
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.435
Just to state the obvious here,

1669
01:11:50.502 --> 01:11:52.471
this is a really nice
sex dungeon.


1670
01:11:52.537 --> 01:11:55.474
- Yeah.
- I'm on the mailing list


1671
01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.709
of the company that makes
this domination gear.


1672
01:11:57.776 --> 01:12:01.480
They're an outfit out of Bruges
called Pamplemousse & Thunder.


1673
01:12:01.546 --> 01:12:02.958
I mean, this is some
of the nice stuff.


1674
01:12:02.982 --> 01:12:05.093
Some of this is actually
next year's stuff, by the way.


1675
01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:06.785
Literally, they advertise

1676
01:12:06.851 --> 01:12:08.687
that your submissives
will never escape.


1677
01:12:08.753 --> 01:12:10.155
So I don't want to be a bummer,

1678
01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:12.424
but this is really well made.

1679
01:12:12.491 --> 01:12:14.994
Warning.

1680
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.395
Warning.

1681
01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:20.865
Ron, thank you
for changing my life.


1682
01:12:20.932 --> 01:12:22.267
I deserve this.

1683
01:12:22.334 --> 01:12:23.511
Thank you for being
the kind of person


1684
01:12:23.535 --> 01:12:25.737
whose life I wanted to change.

1685
01:12:25.804 --> 01:12:28.907
But all your friends, I mean...

1686
01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:32.544
I am blowing them up.

1687
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:35.014
Yeah.

1688
01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.816
About that, um...

1689
01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:39.184
Listen, hey, gang,

1690
01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:40.628
I gotta tell you...
I gotta tell you something.


1691
01:12:40.652 --> 01:12:43.155
I... I really think this is it.

1692
01:12:43.222 --> 01:12:44.599
Do you have to go
to the restroom?


1693
01:12:44.623 --> 01:12:47.659
No, I think we're really
gonna die in here.


1694
01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:49.494
- Jones, don't say that!
- Don't say that.


1695
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:50.662
Don't you say that!

1696
01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:52.297
Even though
it's probably true.


1697
01:12:52.364 --> 01:12:54.333
It's kind of funny
if you think about it.


1698
01:12:54.399 --> 01:12:55.934
No, no.

1699
01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:57.645
You just missed
the whole vibe right there.


1700
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.214
This is bad.
This is really, really bad,


1701
01:12:59.238 --> 01:13:00.672
and I feel... I feel...

1702
01:13:00.739 --> 01:13:03.308
I feel sorry
mostly for me and Rai-Rai,


1703
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:05.910
'cause this...
This is really bad for us.


1704
01:13:05.977 --> 01:13:08.313
Because of the optics?
Guys, can we not agree


1705
01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.382
this sucks equally
pretty much for all of us?


1706
01:13:10.449 --> 01:13:12.617
- No! No! No, we can't agree.
- Yes! Yes!


1707
01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:15.787
No.
It looks worse for us, Jim.


1708
01:13:15.854 --> 01:13:17.398
I think we should just
kind of go with it.


1709
01:13:17.422 --> 01:13:18.557
If we're dying, we're dying.

1710
01:13:18.623 --> 01:13:20.259
But can we do it in silence?

1711
01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:22.194
I think this is it.

1712
01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:25.864
I think we're all gonna die!

1713
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:28.167
I'm gonna bust you guys
out of here.


1714
01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:30.435
Thank you!

1715
01:13:30.502 --> 01:13:33.338
Shh! Shut up!

1716
01:13:36.141 --> 01:13:37.376
Sheriff's Department...

1717
01:13:37.442 --> 01:13:38.910
take a knee.

1718
01:13:41.513 --> 01:13:43.848
Ron Mackleberg thinks
he's about to blow us


1719
01:13:43.915 --> 01:13:46.285
to Q-dom come.

1720
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:49.554
But I'll tell you right now,
I think his math was wrong.


1721
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:52.857
I think he miscounted by nine.

1722
01:13:52.924 --> 01:13:55.060
- Nice.
- Here's the drill.


1723
01:13:55.127 --> 01:13:57.462
I am going to create

1724
01:13:57.529 --> 01:14:01.100
the perfect distraction.

1725
01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:02.701
Oh, fellas.

1726
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:07.539
♫ Oh, it's little puppet Jimmy
and friends ♫


1727
01:14:07.606 --> 01:14:10.442
♫ Coming to your town,
coming 'round the bend ♫


1728
01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:11.943
♫ A place where... ♫

1729
01:14:13.712 --> 01:14:15.347
- Whoo!
- Yeah!


1730
01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:18.117
Hey, sweet thing.

1731
01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:32.364
Hey!

1732
01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:40.705
Cut it right about now.

1733
01:14:40.772 --> 01:14:42.274
Oh!

1734
01:14:50.982 --> 01:14:53.252
Let's get the hell
off this island.


1735
01:15:01.593 --> 01:15:03.362
Hey, ladies!

1736
01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:06.265
You want a little piece of this?

1737
01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:26.818
Game over.

1738
01:15:54.346 --> 01:15:57.582
Ah!

1739
01:17:07.552 --> 01:17:11.723
And you... are... served.

1740
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:13.492
You win.

1741
01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.496
Any questions about the plan?

1742
01:17:17.562 --> 01:17:19.831
- Actually, I have a question.
- Uh-huh?


1743
01:17:19.898 --> 01:17:22.601
I have a lot
of questions about the plan.


1744
01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:25.537
So you want me to kill

1745
01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:27.606
two girls with my bare hands?

1746
01:17:27.672 --> 01:17:28.849
I'm just a guy
that had a plan and...


1747
01:17:28.873 --> 01:17:31.876
You think I can defuse a bomb?

1748
01:17:31.943 --> 01:17:33.778
And shouldn't I be wearing
safety glasses?


1749
01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:35.456
I get... okay,
everybody hates the plan.


1750
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.916
I don't mean to piss all over
your really bitching plan...


1751
01:17:37.982 --> 01:17:39.884
- It's a pretty good plan.
- But...


1752
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:42.186
I kind of already
roofied everybody.


1753
01:17:42.253 --> 01:17:45.189
I put it in everybody's
clam lite lime beer.


1754
01:17:45.256 --> 01:17:46.458
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.


1755
01:17:46.525 --> 01:17:47.659
A million times better.

1756
01:17:47.726 --> 01:17:49.093
Let's go stop that bomb!

1757
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.000
Does anybody remember
how to get out of here?


1758
01:17:51.062 --> 01:17:52.564
I'm definitely turned around.

1759
01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:56.735
- Ron!
- Ron! Come on!


1760
01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:58.637
You got to tell us
how to stop the bomb!


1761
01:17:58.703 --> 01:18:00.439
You can't.

1762
01:18:00.505 --> 01:18:03.174
The guys who killed Khashoggi

1763
01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:05.710
traded it for an NFT.

1764
01:18:05.777 --> 01:18:06.845
It's un-defuseable.

1765
01:18:06.911 --> 01:18:08.146
- Ugh!
- What?


1766
01:18:08.212 --> 01:18:09.548
He's talking gibberish!

1767
01:18:09.614 --> 01:18:12.183
You know what that means.

1768
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.953
Someone has to get this bomb
safely out to sea.


1769
01:18:15.019 --> 01:18:16.321
Not it.

1770
01:18:16.388 --> 01:18:18.065
Obviously, I was gonna do it.
Why volunteer?


1771
01:18:18.089 --> 01:18:19.767
Why would I step in
and say that dramatically?


1772
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.493
I'll do it.
That was really unclear, Jim.


1773
01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.770
Fuck it,
let's just get it out.


1774
01:18:22.794 --> 01:18:23.904
You're acting like a martyr

1775
01:18:23.928 --> 01:18:25.364
and it's not a good look.
Fuck it!


1776
01:18:29.534 --> 01:18:31.102
I'll get it past the breakwater

1777
01:18:31.169 --> 01:18:33.438
If anything happens,
do not help me.


1778
01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:34.739
- We won't.
- How could we?


1779
01:18:34.806 --> 01:18:37.141
I want to tell you
one very short story.


1780
01:18:39.711 --> 01:18:42.313
The doctors told my mama
I would never dance.


1781
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:43.682
Ever.

1782
01:18:43.748 --> 01:18:45.650
And I never did professionally.

1783
01:18:46.851 --> 01:18:48.420
- Shit!
- Shit!


1784
01:18:48.487 --> 01:18:49.654
Goddamn it.

1785
01:18:52.424 --> 01:18:53.592
Wait.

1786
01:18:53.658 --> 01:18:55.026
I think I got it, actually.

1787
01:19:16.347 --> 01:19:17.816
Oh, no.

1788
01:19:26.357 --> 01:19:29.027
Damn.

1789
01:19:29.093 --> 01:19:31.062
Do you see that bandanna
he had on?


1790
01:19:31.129 --> 01:19:32.363
That was mine.

1791
01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:37.802
You've been served.

1792
01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:41.540
Now you guys are real heroes.

1793
01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:43.675
I mean, nobody can know.

1794
01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:46.344
Yeah, sadly,
this is all top secret.


1795
01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:48.713
From the FBI and the CIA,
we want to thank you.


1796
01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.582
Yeah.

1797
01:20:00.324 --> 01:20:03.294
♫ Ave ♫

1798
01:20:03.361 --> 01:20:08.433
♫ Maria ♫

1799
01:20:10.401 --> 01:20:13.605
♫ Gratia ♫

1800
01:20:13.672 --> 01:20:16.641
♫ Plena ♫

1801
01:20:16.708 --> 01:20:22.947
♫ Maria, gratia plena ♫

1802
01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:28.553
♫ Maria, gratia plena ♫

1803
01:20:31.623 --> 01:20:34.258
Well, gang, let's hit the bar.

1804
01:20:51.275 --> 01:20:52.711
Jim?

1805
01:20:53.945 --> 01:20:56.515
Jim, is that you?

1806
01:20:56.581 --> 01:20:58.850
- Jim?
- Dangle?


1807
01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:00.919
Huh? Uh...

1808
01:21:00.985 --> 01:21:04.088
je ne parle pas anglais.

1809
01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:06.825
- What?
- I'm someone else.


1810
01:21:06.891 --> 01:21:08.226
Oh, fuck it! Hey, guys.

1811
01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:09.393
Fuck! Goddamn it!

1812
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.763
Fuck it.

1813
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:12.830
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1814
01:21:15.399 --> 01:21:16.568
Good morning, gang.

1815
01:21:16.635 --> 01:21:18.202
Morning.

1816
01:21:25.309 --> 01:21:28.246
The pig foot by the yard place,

1817
01:21:28.312 --> 01:21:29.881
they've inverted...

1818
01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:31.626
It's called inverted
law enforcement discount.


1819
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:33.251
That mean we pay more?

1820
01:21:33.317 --> 01:21:35.486
They're charging us more
for what they feel like


1821
01:21:35.554 --> 01:21:37.488
we've done to the community
in general.


1822
01:21:37.556 --> 01:21:38.890
Fair enough.

1823
01:21:38.957 --> 01:21:40.124
We deserve it.

1824
01:21:46.464 --> 01:21:48.366
Uh, mixed feelings

1825
01:21:48.432 --> 01:21:50.835
about being back here
in the Silver State.


1826
01:21:50.902 --> 01:21:53.304
You know, in the perfect world

1827
01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:55.607
would I be living
the cruise lifestyle,


1828
01:21:55.674 --> 01:21:57.408
doing my puppetry,

1829
01:21:57.475 --> 01:21:59.310
making that...
Making that puppetry money?


1830
01:21:59.377 --> 01:22:00.979
Which... it's not...

1831
01:22:01.045 --> 01:22:03.748
I've never... I've never, ever
done the puppetry


1832
01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:05.249
just for the money.

1833
01:22:05.316 --> 01:22:06.618
That said,

1834
01:22:06.685 --> 01:22:09.988
I've been doing it here
on the streets a bit.


1835
01:22:10.054 --> 01:22:11.365
You know, and in many ways
that's great,


1836
01:22:11.389 --> 01:22:13.658
'cause I'm also just outside,
you know?


1837
01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:15.159
Just to be outside at all.

1838
01:22:15.226 --> 01:22:17.128
Hey, no smoke inside!

1839
01:22:17.195 --> 01:22:19.115
I'm putting it out.
I'm already putting it out.


1840
01:22:20.999 --> 01:22:23.201
I needed adventure,
and I got it,


1841
01:22:23.267 --> 01:22:27.438
and I have a renewed
sense of purpose.


1842
01:22:27.505 --> 01:22:29.774
And you're probably asking,
well, what about Ron?


1843
01:22:29.841 --> 01:22:30.909
What about him?

1844
01:22:30.975 --> 01:22:32.644
If you're asking me as a deputy,

1845
01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:35.714
I have no idea about Ron.

1846
01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.082
If you're asking me as Clemmie

1847
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:40.451
the woman, the goddess, um,

1848
01:22:40.518 --> 01:22:41.986
of course I know
exactly where he is.


1849
01:22:42.053 --> 01:22:43.154
I'm not stupid.

1850
01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:45.156
I know a good thing
when I see it.


1851
01:22:47.058 --> 01:22:48.059
Hey, handsome.

1852
01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:49.493
Oh!

1853
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.664
I waive my rights.

1854
01:22:52.731 --> 01:22:53.898
I got to be honest.

1855
01:22:53.965 --> 01:22:56.735
I took a lot of money from Q.

1856
01:22:56.801 --> 01:22:58.469
And I would do it again.

1857
01:22:58.536 --> 01:23:01.005
But don't worry,
I'm doing good things with it.


1858
01:23:02.173 --> 01:23:04.275
I brought all my friends
along with me.


1859
01:23:06.077 --> 01:23:08.780
Hey, I'm sorry
I almost left you for dead.


1860
01:23:08.847 --> 01:23:09.848
Forget it.

1861
01:23:09.914 --> 01:23:11.125
- It's all right.
- It's forgotten.


1862
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:12.016
The important thing is
you're here now.


1863
01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:13.918
We are a family.

1864
01:23:13.985 --> 01:23:15.486
- Familia.
- I love you guys.


1865
01:23:15.553 --> 01:23:17.588
Cheers!

1866
01:23:19.223 --> 01:23:21.359
What a beautiful night
for an evening.


1867
01:23:21.425 --> 01:23:23.662
Oh, it sure is.

1868
01:23:23.728 --> 01:23:25.229
To us.

1869
01:23:25.296 --> 01:23:26.665
Stand behind me like this.

1870
01:23:26.731 --> 01:23:28.132
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1871
01:23:28.199 --> 01:23:29.768
Let's human centipede it.

1872
01:23:29.834 --> 01:23:31.970
We'll do a human centipede
Titanic.


1873
01:23:32.036 --> 01:23:34.405
Human centipede Titanic!

1874
01:23:34.472 --> 01:23:37.075
Human centipede Titanic!

1875
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:39.543
Human centipede Titanic!

1876
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.846
Human centipede Titanic!
Ow! Ow! Ow!


1877
01:23:41.913 --> 01:23:43.715
Guys,
we're crushing her uterus.


1878
01:23:43.782 --> 01:23:46.550
We're crushing her uterus.

1879
01:23:46.617 --> 01:23:48.262
- ♫ Don't wanna stop ♫
- ♫ And our hearts ♫


1880
01:23:48.286 --> 01:23:50.889
♫ They beat as one ♫

1881
01:23:50.955 --> 01:23:52.323
♫ Ooh, yeah ♫

1882
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:55.359
♫ No more love on the run ♫

1883
01:23:57.128 --> 01:23:59.063
