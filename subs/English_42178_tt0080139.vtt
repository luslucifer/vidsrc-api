1
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.039
hello, this is
yvette malone speaking.


2
00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:45.075
I'm not home just now,
but if you'll be kind enough...


3
00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:49.681
To leave your name
and telephone number,
I'll call you when I return.


4
00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:51.683
Please begin at the tone.

5
00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:57.154
Yvette, nick here.
Uh, I just thought
I'd let you know that...


6
00:02:57.222 --> 00:03:01.258
I'm still on pa's ship
off the coast of malaysia
thinking about you.


7
00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:04.929
And, uh, sure is nice
to hear your voice.
Even if it is recorded.


8
00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:07.598
<i>well, we're getting some
rough weather here, honey.</i>


9
00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:11.102
So, uh,
I guess I-
they want you
to go up, sir.


10
00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:45.686
Okay, let's go.

11
00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:55.897
All right,
now move your asses.


12
00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.800
Get him to sick bay,
and do it now.


13
00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:04.138
Ha!
Well, if it isn't
mr. Keifitz.


14
00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:06.040
Lookin' more like
your father every day.


15
00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:08.793
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?


16
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.513
No, no, sir.
I brought you an assassin.


17
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:17.001
- A what?
- Yeah, well, that man
that they're moving there.


18
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.304
He says he shot your brother.
He was second rifle
at city hall.


19
00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:24.559
It's an outrage
to bring this man here.


20
00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:29.314
You prefer the native hospital
in brunei where a man can die
of athlete's foot.


21
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.416
I don't have the facilities.
This man fell off an oil rig.


22
00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:34.418
Doctor,
will you leave us?


23
00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:37.021
Then I take
no responsibility.


24
00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.090
That's right.

25
00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:43.561
And you, out.

26
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.031
And you, stay.

27
00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.735
Now, can you write?
Sir?


28
00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:54.205
English. Can you
write english?
I think so, sir.


29
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.578
Do your best.

30
00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:03.681
Be our witness.
Just write down
whatever he says.


31
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.023
Fletcher!
You hear me?


32
00:05:13.842 --> 00:05:18.463
Nick kegan is here.
You understand?


33
00:05:30.743 --> 00:05:33.010
I think he wants
to shake your hand.


34
00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:47.191
Now, what's
your full name?


35
00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.728
Arthur turkus fletcher.

36
00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:53.097
How old are you?

37
00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:55.933
Fifty-eight years.

38
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.153
We will hear your testimony.

39
00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:05.159
I shot president kegan.

40
00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:09.230
<i>Jesus.</i>

41
00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:11.615
How?

42
00:06:11.683 --> 00:06:17.554
I was second rifle in city hall,
February 22, 1960.


43
00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:20.558
I hit with both shots.

44
00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:24.979
Where was
the number one rifle?


45
00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:27.448
Behind the wall.

46
00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:32.587
I shot on the line with him.

47
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:34.756
Who hired you?

48
00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:39.861
Junior. Casper jr.

49
00:06:39.912 --> 00:06:45.282
They remembered me
from shooting demonstrations
for the rifle association.


50
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.754
Said he'd push me into history.

51
00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:53.524
Twenty-five thousand dollars
for a morning's work.


52
00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:56.344
A morning's work.

53
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:58.545
Please,

54
00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:02.449
Mr. Kegan,

55
00:07:02.517 --> 00:07:07.521
The rifle's in the steam pipe
under the middle window
in the engleson building.


56
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:11.125
Room 903.

57
00:07:11.192 --> 00:07:14.462
I left my fingerprints
and all with my name
taped to it...


58
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.850
For when the time came to prove
that I killed the president.


59
00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.321
What about willy arnold?
The pickering commission proved
willie arnold shot my brother.


60
00:07:27.893 --> 00:07:31.612
<i>Nick, he's dead.</i>

61
00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:37.501
You can't run away
from this.


62
00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.087
get a hold of
miles garner in philly,


63
00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.990
Have him meet me
at the airport with
some long underwear.


64
00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:45.393
It'll be
freezing there.
What are you gonna do?


65
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.997
I'm gonna look
for his rifle.
Mm.


66
00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:53.834
<i>whether this guy
is real or not, pa'll understand
I had to leave the ship.</i>


67
00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:58.172
- I'm sure he will.
- I hope so.


68
00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:12.386
You get that down?

69
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.824
I'll look at it.

70
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:23.064
Jesus, you print
like an ape.


71
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.365
I'm a high school graduate.

72
00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:27.868
But I've never been involved
in anything like this.


73
00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:42.116
Now,

74
00:08:42.184 --> 00:08:46.620
You were just a little boy
when president kegan...


75
00:08:46.688 --> 00:08:50.424
Was gunned down
in philadelphia.


76
00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:54.829
But in the subsequent

77
00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:58.165
More than 16 people,

78
00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:03.737
Who seemingly
had nothing to do
with that awful event,


79
00:09:04.806 --> 00:09:09.510
Have died under
mysterious conditions.


80
00:09:13.882 --> 00:09:18.236
If what you say is true,
nick, it's gonna shake up
a lot of people.


81
00:09:18.303 --> 00:09:21.705
President, congress,
everyone.
Especially pa.


82
00:09:21.773 --> 00:09:25.142
Does he know?
No, not yet.


83
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:33.433
I guess this assassin thought
nobody'd look for him, working
for the president's father, huh?


84
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:35.702
We're gonna need a wrench
for the steam pipe.


85
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.771
We'll get it
from the building supervisor.


86
00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:42.676
Captain heller, this way.

87
00:09:42.744 --> 00:09:45.546
Captain heller,
that's the wrong building!


88
00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:52.953
Is he reliable, miles?
Captain heller,
philadelphia's finest.


89
00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:57.391
He drinks a bit, but if
there's a rifle up there,
he'll know how to handle it.


90
00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:01.328
Captain heller, nick kegan.
We have no time
to lose, captain.


91
00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:05.132
You say you're
nicholas kegan?
That's right.


92
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.134
Got any identification?

93
00:10:09.637 --> 00:10:13.340
<i>Come on. I've known
nick since he was a boy.
He's tom kegan's son.</i>


94
00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:15.409
Our late president's
half-brother, okay?


95
00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:17.611
You'll vouch for him?
Of course, yes.


96
00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:20.681
Good enough. Now, uh,
what's the problem here,
fellas?


97
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.879
It's this way, captain.

98
00:10:34.947 --> 00:10:37.648
Oh. Kegan,

99
00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:40.184
We did everything possible
to protect your brother here.


100
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:42.386
But you can't protect
anyone against a nut.


101
00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:45.690
Nine-oh-three.
Damn shame.


102
00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:49.293
Police, open up.
Open up in there.
Police.


103
00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:57.901
You john kullers?

104
00:10:57.936 --> 00:11:02.790
- We'd like to have a look
at your steam pipe.
- My steam pipe?


105
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.010
We'll get a search warrant
if necessary.


106
00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:08.829
Search warrant
for a steam pipe?


107
00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:14.151
how long have you
occupied these premises?


108
00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:17.121
<i>cops. Why me?
Answer the question.</i>


109
00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:20.658
<i>Four years, I don't know.
Where were you
on February 22, 1960.</i>


110
00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:24.795
<i>1960? What is this?
You don't remember the date
president kegan was shot?</i>


111
00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:28.966
Long island. In school.
Mrs. Sayers' eighth grade
english class.


112
00:11:29.034 --> 00:11:30.951
Oh, yeah?

113
00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.053
Look, hey, I got
a legitimate
operation here.


114
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.989
All right, miles.
I'll check it.
Stand back.


115
00:12:26.674 --> 00:12:29.210
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:32.046
Sorry? What for?

117
00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:35.149
Now you'll have to
live it all over again.


118
00:12:35.217 --> 00:12:37.451
I could put it back.

119
00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.520
You'll always
know where it was.


120
00:12:59.658 --> 00:13:02.977
Oh, the hell with it.

121
00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:07.348
What's that?
What is that?
That's not mine.


122
00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:09.917
You make one sound
about what you saw
here today,


123
00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:12.086
And you'll be
the sorriest little man
in the sticks.


124
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.241
Boy, this'll stink
right up to heaven.


125
00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:20.678
Yeah, this is the kind
of thing that rises.


126
00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:28.585
Hey, take this. I don't
like the way it feels.


127
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:34.925
- Where to, captain?
- Bring it to the f.B.I.,
wouldn't you say?


128
00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:36.927
Oh, why not?
They probably built it.


129
00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:41.565
"they probably built it."

130
00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:02.336
Miles! Miles.

131
00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:17.017
Help!

132
00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:32.899
Phone? Do you have-

133
00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:47.281
Mr. Kegan's office.
Who's calling, operator?


134
00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:50.901
Yes, we will.
Hello, mr. Kegan?


135
00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:54.338
No, I'm sorry.
Your father left for
rockrimmon last night.


136
00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:56.340
I'm not sure.
I'll give you rosemary.


137
00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:07.517
Yes, nick.
How nice to hear from you.


138
00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:10.787
Your father's left the house
already for his golf.


139
00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:12.789
May I help you?

140
00:15:12.857 --> 00:15:15.425
In the desert, yes.

141
00:15:15.493 --> 00:15:19.163
Well, how urgent?
I see.


142
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:22.299
Oh, dear.
I'd better connect you
with john cerruti. Hold on.


143
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.360
Nick. Surprise, surprise.
How are you? Where are you?


144
00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:36.496
You left the boat, nick.
Left the ship.
That's naughty of you.


145
00:15:36.564 --> 00:15:38.865
Very bad not telling
headquarters. Your father-


146
00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:40.867
What? What rifle?

147
00:15:42.603 --> 00:15:47.208
Uh-huh. In philadelphia?
Well, that's astonishing.


148
00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:49.776
Well, it's startling.
Shocking about miles.


149
00:15:49.844 --> 00:15:52.946
Listen,
now where are you now?
Exactly where?


150
00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:57.051
Okay, follow me carefully.
Do nothing. I'll handle
the police. You wait for a car.


151
00:15:57.118 --> 00:16:00.620
We'll pick you up and
you can discuss this with
your father in rockrimmon.


152
00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:03.257
And nick, don't panic.
Panic is counterproductive.


153
00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:58.562
How are you, keith?
The same. Always the same.


154
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.431
And you,
you're looking good.


155
00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:03.467
where's pa?
He's playing golf.


156
00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:05.435
But he should be
back any time now.


157
00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:09.956
I've got to see him right away.
Hey, shogun. Shogun. Shogun.


158
00:17:12.126 --> 00:17:15.429
You've been gone
a long time, nick.


159
00:17:15.497 --> 00:17:17.431
Shogun forget.

160
00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:19.800
Have you had dinner?
No, not yet.


161
00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:23.954
First, I'd like to take
a look at pa's copy
of the full pickering report.


162
00:17:24.022 --> 00:17:26.390
That will only make you sad.

163
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:30.194
Sad? Now, you once told me
all knowledge was good.


164
00:17:30.262 --> 00:17:35.499
I don't recall.
Actually, that not
something I would say.


165
00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:42.473
I'll go find pa.

166
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:09.733
I'm freezing.

167
00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:12.736
Sun's going down.
The desert's
supposed to be hot.


168
00:18:12.804 --> 00:18:15.572
Quit bitching. You've
been bitching all day.
I don't like it.


169
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.875
What am I gonna do
with these girls,
mr. Secretary?


170
00:18:17.942 --> 00:18:19.877
First they're hot,
then they're cold.


171
00:18:19.944 --> 00:18:22.579
When she's hot again,
send her over.


172
00:18:22.647 --> 00:18:26.116
I'm always hot.

173
00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:36.826
Hello, pa.

174
00:18:38.796 --> 00:18:40.897
Y'all know my son,
nicholas.
Hi, nick.


175
00:18:40.932 --> 00:18:42.900
<i>all grown up, nick.</i>

176
00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:45.436
<i>He ain't a global figure,
like his brother was.
No interest.</i>


177
00:18:45.503 --> 00:18:47.888
He's a seafaring man
like yourself, admiral.


178
00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:49.656
Good boy.
Right, nick?


179
00:18:49.724 --> 00:18:51.909
If you say so, pa.

180
00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:55.128
- You didn't tell me you were
leaving the boat, son.
- I had to.


181
00:18:55.997 --> 00:18:58.983
What do you think
these girls are doing
under this blanket, son?


182
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.002
I don't know, pa.

183
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.738
Think they're
playing with my nuts?


184
00:19:04.805 --> 00:19:06.639
you're awful.

185
00:19:06.707 --> 00:19:10.010
I gotta talk to you, pa.

186
00:19:10.094 --> 00:19:11.995
You better believe it, boy.

187
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.079
"clair de lune" ]

188
00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:50.633
Am I disturbing you?

189
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:52.769
mother, what are
you doing here?


190
00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:56.273
Oh, shh! I'm supposed
to be a secret.


191
00:20:00.845 --> 00:20:02.779
I thought you
were in nantucket.


192
00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:04.781
Oh, it was freezing there.

193
00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:08.585
And nobody came to visit.
I met this real nice man.


194
00:20:08.652 --> 00:20:11.755
Pa said he just
wanted my money.


195
00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:13.757
So he sent for me.

196
00:20:13.824 --> 00:20:16.826
It's a big secret.
The newspapers, you know.


197
00:20:16.894 --> 00:20:20.563
<i>Oh, nicholas, cocoa's sick.</i>

198
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:23.200
she's sick.

199
00:20:23.268 --> 00:20:25.235
Aw, let me see.
No, no.


200
00:20:25.303 --> 00:20:28.171
No, she's not well.

201
00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.141
Look.

202
00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:33.510
See, she's sick.

203
00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:35.879
Don't be sick on me, honey.
Please don't.


204
00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:38.348
It's just her paw, mom.
She'll be all right.


205
00:20:38.416 --> 00:20:42.352
Keith will take her
to the vet tomorrow.
They'll know what to do.


206
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.354
She's never been
like this before.


207
00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:47.524
It frightens me.

208
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:49.559
You frighten mommy.

209
00:20:51.896 --> 00:20:53.897
I'll speak to keith
before I leave.


210
00:20:53.964 --> 00:20:56.032
He'll take care of it
for you.


211
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.968
You look real handsome.

212
00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:03.206
thank you, mom.

213
00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:08.178
Listen, I got a great idea.
Let's have an easter egg hunt
on the lawn.


214
00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:12.316
We'll get all dressed up.
Everybody will come.
We'll make it black-tie.


215
00:21:12.383 --> 00:21:16.886
Wouldn't that be wonderful
to have a formal easter egg hunt
on the lawn with our friends?


216
00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:19.222
You can stay for that.

217
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.261
It's winter.
The middle of winter, mom.


218
00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:30.233
But isn't it
a lovely idea?


219
00:21:32.337 --> 00:21:34.037
Yes, mom, it is.

220
00:21:44.432 --> 00:21:46.366
C-cocoa's sick.

221
00:21:49.904 --> 00:21:51.504
You didn't tell me
nick was here.


222
00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:55.425
- I didn't know
he was coming, emma.
- You're always mad...


223
00:21:55.493 --> 00:21:59.930
Just because
nick doesn't wanna be
president like tim did.


224
00:21:59.998 --> 00:22:02.766
He's different,
that's all.


225
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:05.202
He's my son
and he's-


226
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:07.204
He's sensitive.

227
00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:10.807
Different wives
have different sons.


228
00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:14.011
Yes, emma.

229
00:22:27.658 --> 00:22:30.494
Come on, honey.
Let's go up to our room.


230
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.399
I'm flying dr. Marshall
in from washington.


231
00:22:35.466 --> 00:22:39.436
He's got some new cure
thinks maybe will help her.
Some kind of vitamins.


232
00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:41.771
- I hope it works.
- It won't.


233
00:22:43.408 --> 00:22:46.309
You abandoned my ship.
Pa-


234
00:22:46.377 --> 00:22:50.113
I got 60 million bucks floating
there and you take off like
she's Friday night's hooker.


235
00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:53.116
- If you'll let me,
I'll tell you why.
- Make it snappy.


236
00:22:53.184 --> 00:22:56.085
I got people outside.
What the hell were you
doing in philly?


237
00:22:56.153 --> 00:22:58.872
- I called you.
You don't take my calls.
- Didn't cerruti tell you?


238
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.159
Cerruti? I gotta hear
from cerruti? What's
he gotta do with this?


239
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.497
It concerns tim, pa.

240
00:23:07.565 --> 00:23:10.450
Tim?

241
00:23:10.518 --> 00:23:12.085
What about tim?

242
00:23:12.153 --> 00:23:15.923
I was on the teekay
when a man named fletcher
confessed on his deathbed...


243
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.958
That he'd been
one of the two riflemen.


244
00:23:18.026 --> 00:23:20.627
- Bullshit.
- He told us where
he'd hidden the rifle.


245
00:23:20.695 --> 00:23:25.365
And this morning I found it with
miles garner and captain heller
of the philadelphia police.


246
00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:28.001
Where is
this historic weapon?


247
00:23:29.753 --> 00:23:31.488
- I dunno.
- You don't know?


248
00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:35.108
everybody was killed
as we were leaving the building.


249
00:23:35.176 --> 00:23:40.347
I was trying to reach you when
the car was driven away with
their bodies. And the rifle.


250
00:23:40.415 --> 00:23:42.782
And this is the tale
you come home with?


251
00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:47.988
Keifitz heard
the confession on the ship.
An orderly wrote it down.


252
00:23:49.257 --> 00:23:51.191
Wrote it down?

253
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:57.397
Pa?

254
00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:01.568
You all right, pa?

255
00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.704
Just wanted
to say good night.


256
00:24:21.772 --> 00:24:24.574
Oh, would you please
have a veterinarian
check out mother's dog?


257
00:24:24.641 --> 00:24:26.876
Something's wrong
with its leg.


258
00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:29.779
I'll have it attended to.

259
00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:31.781
Don't turn out
the light, please.


260
00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:35.284
All right.
Good night.
Good night.


261
00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:49.732
hope I don't
sound too depressed,


262
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.568
But so much
has been happening
in the past few days.


263
00:24:52.636 --> 00:24:55.471
I got a lot to tell you.
Most of all,


264
00:24:55.539 --> 00:25:00.343
I wanna tell you that
the more I hear your voice,
the more I feel I do love you.


265
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.147
Maybe I'll come to new york
and make an honest woman
out of you, huh?


266
00:25:04.215 --> 00:25:06.149
Bye-bye.

267
00:25:06.217 --> 00:25:08.417
Hello? Hello?

268
00:25:08.485 --> 00:25:10.419
Hello, nick.

269
00:25:25.052 --> 00:25:27.520
Come on, boy.
Wake up.


270
00:25:27.588 --> 00:25:30.156
Got to get our ass
in gear.


271
00:25:30.224 --> 00:25:32.158
What time is it?
Time for action.


272
00:25:32.226 --> 00:25:34.927
I've been up all night.
Talked to keifitz in brunei.


273
00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:37.096
Um, looks like
you were telling the truth.


274
00:25:37.164 --> 00:25:39.098
The truth?
Pa, I'm your son.


275
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:41.918
Yeah, you always had
an excitable imagination.


276
00:25:41.986 --> 00:25:46.956
For a while, as a boy,
I was afraid you might
turn out to be a fag.


277
00:25:47.024 --> 00:25:48.958
You're a real winner, pa.

278
00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:51.561
Keifitz is on his way here
with that killer's confession.


279
00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:54.431
Then we go the limit
to bust this thing
wide open.


280
00:25:54.498 --> 00:25:56.433
You're bringing
the confession
to the president?


281
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.069
Hell, no.
That moron can't read
to find the men's room.


282
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.240
We gotta picture it for him.
Evidence. Find the rifle.


283
00:26:03.307 --> 00:26:07.410
The men behind this fletcher.
And the man behind those men.
Then we go to the president.


284
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.395
This is bigger
than we are, pa.


285
00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:12.199
What the president
will do is resurrect
the pickering commission.


286
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:13.934
Fucking corpses to begin with.

287
00:26:14.002 --> 00:26:16.286
Well, you accepted that
willy arnold acted alone.


288
00:26:16.354 --> 00:26:18.538
Sure as hell I did.

289
00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:21.475
If I had pointed a finger
at the russians, the cubans,


290
00:26:21.542 --> 00:26:23.977
Some goddamn hoodlums
or industrialists-


291
00:26:24.044 --> 00:26:26.813
Maybe throw us
in a world war, civil war.


292
00:26:26.881 --> 00:26:29.983
Sure I accepted it.
I got interests in this country.


293
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.784
Interests in this country?

294
00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:36.689
Yeah, interests. But don't think
I fell for the arnold theory.


295
00:26:36.757 --> 00:26:40.593
I've been a hunter all my life.
I know the best of them.


296
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:44.330
And the best
have trouble with one shot
of the kind that killed tim.


297
00:26:44.398 --> 00:26:47.633
Let alone three.

298
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.803
And then arnold
getting it from joe diamond,
the plump saloon keeper,


299
00:26:50.871 --> 00:26:54.640
While arnold's handcuffed
to detectives surrounded
by 75 rookies.


300
00:26:54.708 --> 00:26:57.944
That's what I mean, pa.
We need help in this.
Help? Like who?


301
00:26:58.012 --> 00:27:01.831
The c.I.A.? They smuggle
my cigars from havana,
that's what they do.


302
00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:05.802
Import, export.
And the f.B.I.'s good
for chasing runaways.


303
00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:09.639
Fucking f.B.I. Gave
the commission its information
in the first place, remember?


304
00:27:09.707 --> 00:27:13.076
This ain't the forties anymore.
It's a whole new ball game.


305
00:27:13.143 --> 00:27:17.880
We gotta be pioneers, son.
We gotta face that
we're alone in the wilderness.


306
00:27:17.948 --> 00:27:20.783
We got what the pioneers had,
all they had.


307
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:23.653
- The family.
- The family unit.


308
00:27:23.721 --> 00:27:27.624
God blessed you, goddamn it,
with the best of families.


309
00:27:27.692 --> 00:27:29.626
My international vice president,
john cerruti,


310
00:27:29.694 --> 00:27:32.796
Has files on the high and mighty
and the low and ornery...


311
00:27:32.864 --> 00:27:36.199
That make the c.I.A. Record
look like the corner newsstand.


312
00:27:36.266 --> 00:27:40.904
Information's power. And now
we're gonna use it to get
to the bottom of this thing.


313
00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:45.075
Then we go to the president
and congress, as a family unit.


314
00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:49.679
And rub their fucking noses
in the dirt that killed my son.


315
00:27:49.747 --> 00:27:51.781
Now, get your ass out of bed.

316
00:27:53.768 --> 00:27:58.271
Oh, and by the way,
you won't need the vet.


317
00:27:58.338 --> 00:28:01.474
The vet?
Yeah, the vet for cocoa.


318
00:28:01.542 --> 00:28:05.111
Your mother passed out
last night and smothered
the mutt in her sleep.


319
00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:07.163
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.


320
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:11.601
Sleeps with the goddamn dog.
Crazy woman. Now move!


321
00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:26.383
I'm sorry, mom.

322
00:29:42.243 --> 00:29:45.578
You stink, pa!
You stink!


323
00:29:50.617 --> 00:29:52.551
Captain heller
died two years ago...


324
00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:54.687
In the virgin islands
of a heart attack.


325
00:29:54.755 --> 00:29:58.224
So miles was either duped
or duped you with a phony.


326
00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:00.860
And your wig-maker friend
jumped out the window.


327
00:30:00.928 --> 00:30:04.530
Police say suicide,
'cause vandals
wrecked his business.


328
00:30:04.598 --> 00:30:07.867
Sit down.
No, thanks.


329
00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:10.854
Now, where do we start?

330
00:30:10.921 --> 00:30:12.856
looks like
we've already started.


331
00:30:12.923 --> 00:30:15.091
We got three names at the top.

332
00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:18.561
Fletcher, casper jr.,
and z.K. Dawson.


333
00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:23.132
Dawson's the big one.
One of the richest cocksuckers
in the u.S.A.


334
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.969
Christ. This takes me back.

335
00:30:27.238 --> 00:30:30.740
Yeah, there it is.
Tim and me in the primaries.


336
00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:33.526
Dawson was up against us,
pushing us hard.


337
00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:37.130
You were just a kid.
Spent a lot of money
in that state.


338
00:30:37.197 --> 00:30:41.167
I mean, over-the-counter,
under-the-table, tucked-into-
a-box-of-cigars money.


339
00:30:41.234 --> 00:30:44.771
Shit, put out 9,700
primary-day workers alone.


340
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:47.373
Most gorgeous tv commercial
you ever saw.


341
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:52.145
Tim leading tanks to liberate
the hess sector in germany.
Geez, he looked great.


342
00:30:52.212 --> 00:30:55.014
Ah, made a big noise
in that shitty little state.


343
00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:58.017
Got 53 movie stars
to turn out.


344
00:30:58.085 --> 00:31:01.237
And, uh,
all that time and...


345
00:31:01.305 --> 00:31:05.508
After and...
Before and during.


346
00:31:05.575 --> 00:31:10.746
Everything I did,
every dime I spent,


347
00:31:10.814 --> 00:31:14.517
Every threat I made,
I was just leading tim
further along the road...


348
00:31:14.585 --> 00:31:16.785
To meet that bullet.

349
00:31:18.956 --> 00:31:22.592
- It sounds like that's
just what you were doing, pa.
- What?


350
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:26.096
Leading tim along.

351
00:31:26.163 --> 00:31:30.467
Listen, kid. We find the killers
of your brother and you'll be
a hero like he was.


352
00:31:30.534 --> 00:31:32.469
A fucking legend.

353
00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:37.006
- I don't wanna be a legend.
- What the hell do you wanna be,
a goddamned piano player?


354
00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:39.041
maybe, but I'm not very good.

355
00:31:39.109 --> 00:31:42.762
- You stink. You're lousy.
- I know that.


356
00:31:42.829 --> 00:31:45.965
You know that?
You ain't a piano player,
you ain't an artist.


357
00:31:46.033 --> 00:31:48.801
You got no business sense,
no political sense.


358
00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:52.271
What the hell
do you want anyway?
Where are your values in life?


359
00:31:52.339 --> 00:31:54.974
I honestly don't know.

360
00:31:55.042 --> 00:31:57.710
Do you get laid?

361
00:31:58.879 --> 00:32:02.315
- I ask you, do you get laid?
- Yeah.


362
00:32:02.383 --> 00:32:05.117
You know how many times
your brother got laid
in office?


363
00:32:05.185 --> 00:32:09.489
<i>- What are you,
the national inquirer?
- One thousand seventy-two.</i>


364
00:32:09.557 --> 00:32:11.491
And with a schedule like his.

365
00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:13.693
Maybe politics
don't turn me on.


366
00:32:13.761 --> 00:32:18.297
Your brother was a giant.
You'll be the same. You watch.


367
00:32:18.365 --> 00:32:21.834
Now, I set up a meeting
with you and z.K. Dawson.


368
00:32:21.902 --> 00:32:24.704
He'll lie of course.
But you'll get something
from the meeting.


369
00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:27.506
- No, pa.
- What?


370
00:32:27.574 --> 00:32:30.076
I said no.

371
00:32:30.143 --> 00:32:32.929
What no? Here's a map
on how to get there.


372
00:32:32.996 --> 00:32:36.399
He's south of tulsa.
It's all arranged. Take it.


373
00:32:37.968 --> 00:32:40.337
Take it!

374
00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:48.244
- Okay, pa. For the family.
- You bet your ass.


375
00:32:50.514 --> 00:32:53.382
Good luck, boy.
I'll be with ya.


376
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.301
<i>I know you will, pa!</i>

377
00:33:10.634 --> 00:33:13.135
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?


378
00:33:13.203 --> 00:33:15.871
Yes, I'm here
to see mr. Dawson.
Your name, please.


379
00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:17.923
Nicholas kegan.

380
00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:23.629
You go right ahead.
Z.K.'s on the playing field.
Take the turn to your right...


381
00:33:23.697 --> 00:33:26.599
Before you reach the house
and that's where
you'll find him.


382
00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:29.201
Thank you.

383
00:35:01.878 --> 00:35:05.013
Yeah, I'm z.K. Dawson.
Who the hell are you?


384
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.417
I'm nicholas kegan!

385
00:35:09.303 --> 00:35:11.854
Get out of the vehicle.

386
00:35:11.922 --> 00:35:14.090
I said,
get out of the vehicle.


387
00:35:16.893 --> 00:35:18.827
Uh, speak up.

388
00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:22.064
I'm, uh, nick kegan.
Tom kegan's son.


389
00:35:22.132 --> 00:35:26.502
I know that. But what are you
doing here on my playing field,
messing up our games?


390
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.721
Oh, the guard said, well-

391
00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:32.525
I don't care what the guard
told you, I wanna know
what you're doing here.


392
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.594
We had an appointment,
mr. Dawson.


393
00:35:34.661 --> 00:35:36.695
I'm aware of that fact.

394
00:35:36.763 --> 00:35:39.098
Now you're wasting my time.

395
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:42.568
- Well, look here, uh-
- watch your tone.


396
00:35:44.254 --> 00:35:46.355
- Mr. Dawson-
- that's better.


397
00:35:49.192 --> 00:35:52.494
Mr. Dawson,
we've discovered a rifle.


398
00:35:52.562 --> 00:35:56.365
We have every reason to believe
it's the weapon that killed
my brother in philadelphia.


399
00:35:56.433 --> 00:36:00.052
Your brother was
a miserable, cold-assed,
arrogant son of a bitch.


400
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.856
And not a good friend of mine,
as I guess is well known to you.


401
00:36:03.924 --> 00:36:06.392
Yes, I'm aware of that.

402
00:36:08.228 --> 00:36:11.030
But the assassin was hired
by a man named casper jr.


403
00:36:11.097 --> 00:36:14.199
And as you know everyone
of importance in the area,
we thought-


404
00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:18.454
What I ought to do
is run right over you,
flatten you like a waffle.


405
00:36:18.521 --> 00:36:21.590
Sir?
I know
why you're here.


406
00:36:21.658 --> 00:36:25.745
You're here because you think
I had some part of a conspiracy
killed your brother.


407
00:36:25.813 --> 00:36:28.964
You and all the other
conspiracy lovers in this
conspiracy-loving country.


408
00:36:29.032 --> 00:36:30.866
Actually, mr. Dawson-

409
00:36:30.934 --> 00:36:34.787
Why should I kill your brother
when I'm getting rich off him?


410
00:36:34.854 --> 00:36:37.623
Off his military spendin',
his space spendin'.


411
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.093
His tax reduction
a-and h-his crisis spendin'.


412
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:45.564
Hell, you know if your old man
didn't own him already,
I might have bought him myself.


413
00:36:45.632 --> 00:36:48.234
Except for
his snotty personality.


414
00:36:48.302 --> 00:36:51.320
I didn't come here
to listen to slander,
mr. Dawson.


415
00:36:51.388 --> 00:36:54.356
slander?

416
00:36:54.424 --> 00:36:56.225
You think before you speak,
young man.


417
00:36:56.293 --> 00:37:01.147
Hell, they didn't
teach you kids nothing
since 1944.


418
00:37:01.214 --> 00:37:03.916
Hey, I didn't kill your brother.

419
00:37:03.984 --> 00:37:08.271
That's a vile, cruel,
mythological invention.


420
00:37:08.338 --> 00:37:11.640
But it is also a-
an infectious invention.


421
00:37:11.708 --> 00:37:15.311
And when it reached the ears
of my daughter, I thought,
maybe I'll make...


422
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:18.747
A couple of phone calls
and really find out
who did the deed.


423
00:37:18.815 --> 00:37:21.284
Who might that be?

424
00:37:21.351 --> 00:37:24.019
The philadelphia police
killed your brother.


425
00:37:24.087 --> 00:37:26.956
The man in charge
of the operation
was a captain heller.


426
00:37:27.023 --> 00:37:30.960
So if I was you,
I'd just go and have
a talk with that man.


427
00:37:31.028 --> 00:37:34.463
- Uh, he's dead.
- Well, then I'd track down
a sidekick of his.


428
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:36.699
A man named ray doty.

429
00:37:41.921 --> 00:37:44.223
Thank you.
Yeah, well,
you're welcome.


430
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.291
Now, I'm gonna
tell you one more thing.


431
00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:49.362
I'm gonna give you
a head start of 30 seconds.


432
00:37:49.429 --> 00:37:52.965
And then me and my boys here,
we're coming after you.


433
00:37:53.033 --> 00:37:54.967
Sir?
You heard me.


434
00:37:55.035 --> 00:37:57.737
We still got some
private property
in this country.


435
00:37:57.804 --> 00:38:02.207
Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven...

436
00:38:56.613 --> 00:38:59.115
I'm looking for a passenger
named nicholas kegan.


437
00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:10.826
Mr. Kegan?
Yes?


438
00:39:10.894 --> 00:39:14.230
Telephone call for you.
Please hurry.
We're beginning our descent.


439
00:39:18.068 --> 00:39:20.736
You have a telephone call
for me here?
Please.


440
00:39:27.244 --> 00:39:29.611
I have a telephone call
up here.


441
00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:31.814
where the hell is he?

442
00:39:31.882 --> 00:39:35.317
Pa?
You didn't call me
when you left dawson.


443
00:39:35.385 --> 00:39:39.388
Pa, there are hundreds
of people on board.
Uh, we're about to land.


444
00:39:39.455 --> 00:39:43.242
Maybe, but I'm still
losing money on this airline.
Now, what'd dawson say?


445
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.627
He says it's heller
in the philadelphia police.


446
00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:49.932
Says I should talk to a cop
named ray doty. He also
fired on my car with tanks.


447
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.269
The old coot.
Ray doty. I'll arrange it.
That why you going to new york?


448
00:39:54.337 --> 00:39:57.172
come on. Come on.
No, I'm gonna see my girl.


449
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.208
Girl? What girl?
Just a girl, pa.
Look, I gotta go.


450
00:40:00.276 --> 00:40:04.546
Forget the girl.
You go see doty.
By the way, keifitz is dead.


451
00:40:04.614 --> 00:40:07.883
Keifitz?
Died in brunei.


452
00:40:07.951 --> 00:40:12.354
Keifitz?
What about the confession?


453
00:40:12.422 --> 00:40:16.324
Orderly's dead too. Fell off
the toilet and broke his neck.
What?


454
00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:20.713
4-14, 4-14, where are you?

455
00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:36.896
It's safe to talk in here.

456
00:40:39.966 --> 00:40:42.100
These lights
stay on all the time?


457
00:40:42.168 --> 00:40:45.370
Day and night.
All year round.


458
00:40:45.438 --> 00:40:49.074
They never know
what time it is.
Just keep laying those eggs.


459
00:40:49.142 --> 00:40:52.545
And they never hatch.
Never do.


460
00:40:52.612 --> 00:40:57.449
Give 'em hormones, of course.
And amphetamines.
Keeps 'em going.


461
00:40:57.517 --> 00:40:59.919
They're all on speed.

462
00:40:59.986 --> 00:41:02.254
Jittery as hell.

463
00:41:02.322 --> 00:41:05.591
My father's information
agency has paid you.
Is this, uh-


464
00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:09.261
I took the cash.
Just like in the old days.


465
00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:11.731
Once a cop,
always a cop.


466
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.070
Wish I was back
on the force sometimes.


467
00:41:18.137 --> 00:41:21.373
So how did, uh,
casper jr. Get to you?


468
00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:25.143
Oh, he didn't get to us.
He got to joe diamond.


469
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:27.179
¶

470
00:41:27.247 --> 00:41:31.016
You do that very well.
I think-


471
00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.018
now you gotta understand...

472
00:41:33.086 --> 00:41:36.255
That joe diamond
was a notorious cop lover.


473
00:41:36.322 --> 00:41:39.925
<i>I mean, a real cop lover.</i>

474
00:41:39.993 --> 00:41:42.094
He always kept this nightclub
full of rookies.


475
00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:45.030
Drinking beer, getting high.

476
00:41:45.098 --> 00:41:47.432
<i>Anyway,
the meeting was set up...</i>


477
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.568
Between diamond
and an old pal of his.


478
00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:51.570
It took place in tucson.

479
00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:12.474
How you been, gameboy?

480
00:42:12.542 --> 00:42:17.612
Oh, older and fatter.
Uglier. Like you.


481
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.067
I don't know.

482
00:42:22.135 --> 00:42:25.303
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.


483
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:28.240
What'd you eat?

484
00:42:28.307 --> 00:42:31.010
Pastrami on whole wheat
with celery tonic.


485
00:42:31.077 --> 00:42:34.446
Any good?

486
00:42:34.514 --> 00:42:36.849
Lousy.
Tucson.


487
00:42:36.916 --> 00:42:41.369
Don't ever order the
wild west pastrami.
Sit down.


488
00:42:47.043 --> 00:42:51.847
it's like old times.

489
00:42:51.915 --> 00:42:54.449
Y-you remember us
in atlantic city?


490
00:42:54.517 --> 00:42:57.552
Maybe. Maybe not.

491
00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.554
But I got
a contract for you.


492
00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:03.726
One of the biggest contracts
ever handed out anywheres.


493
00:43:03.794 --> 00:43:06.512
Me? I
-I'm a restaurant man.

494
00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:09.715
You're also a thief
who is crazy enough to steal...


495
00:43:09.783 --> 00:43:13.051
From moey and sam
and morris and uncle louie.


496
00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:15.554
I wanna pay back.

497
00:43:15.622 --> 00:43:17.623
you are fucking right.

498
00:43:18.725 --> 00:43:20.659
I
-I can pay back?

499
00:43:20.727 --> 00:43:23.395
When you handle this hit,
you'll be paying back.


500
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.848
A hit?

501
00:43:25.916 --> 00:43:31.320
Why me? There must be 200
mechanics around here can
make any hit better than me.


502
00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:35.824
I told 'em. No good.
Those guys aren't political.


503
00:43:35.892 --> 00:43:38.293
I'm political?

504
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:42.381
You were in cuba.
Very good friends
with a certain minister.


505
00:43:42.449 --> 00:43:45.901
I thought about you a lot,
gameboy.


506
00:43:46.236 --> 00:43:49.271
You have a commie background
in the f.B.I. Files.


507
00:43:49.339 --> 00:43:53.075
Commie? I was out of cuba
ten years before castro.


508
00:43:53.142 --> 00:43:57.847
Joe, what do you
want from me?
You were in cuba.


509
00:43:57.914 --> 00:44:01.083
This is crazy.
Anyways,
youse gotta make the hit.


510
00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.254
- Who's the contract?
- There are two.


511
00:44:06.322 --> 00:44:08.423
We've already taken care
of the first one.


512
00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:11.593
You make the second hit.
A kid named willie arnold.


513
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:14.096
I don't know him.

514
00:44:14.163 --> 00:44:16.098
A-and who's the first?

515
00:44:16.165 --> 00:44:18.701
President kegan.

516
00:44:29.595 --> 00:44:33.832
so diamond went back to philly
to get ahold of captain heller.


517
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.601
Heller was my superior officer
at the time.


518
00:44:36.669 --> 00:44:39.438
He was a great family man.

519
00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:42.942
Seven daughters
and a big house.


520
00:44:43.009 --> 00:44:45.144
Daughters are expensive.

521
00:44:46.947 --> 00:44:49.949
¶

522
00:45:02.245 --> 00:45:07.482
After the assignation,
diamond's job was
to shoot the phony assassin,


523
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.951
Willie arnold,
in the police station.


524
00:45:10.019 --> 00:45:14.323
Heller was paid to get an in.

525
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:17.559
Heller was terrific
at organization.


526
00:45:17.626 --> 00:45:20.295
Our last meeting took place
right here at this farm.


527
00:45:20.363 --> 00:45:23.631
Here's two sets of keys
to the engleson building.


528
00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:27.134
Get them to the texan
when he arrives tomorrow.
Right, captain.


529
00:45:27.169 --> 00:45:31.357
Willie arnold should be
planted in the tv center
warehouse by half past 9:00.


530
00:45:31.424 --> 00:45:33.525
The motorcade will pass
towards city hall at 12:30.


531
00:45:34.127 --> 00:45:38.580
Ray will give you your rifle
and some shells to have arnold
throw on the floor as evidence.


532
00:45:38.648 --> 00:45:43.518
Tell willie arnold to go home
after the real hit. If we need
him, we'll send a patrol car.


533
00:45:43.586 --> 00:45:46.321
Ray will give you
the rest of the details.


534
00:45:46.389 --> 00:45:50.593
And when we arrest arnold
after the hit, you know
what you have to do. Right, joe?


535
00:45:52.895 --> 00:45:54.829
Yeah, I know.

536
00:45:54.897 --> 00:45:58.900
There are a lot of things
we gotta consider here.


537
00:45:58.968 --> 00:46:01.503
All right, cut it out,
will you? Come on.


538
00:46:03.406 --> 00:46:05.341
how did they find diamond?

539
00:46:05.408 --> 00:46:07.376
<i>Who?
Casper jr.
And his people.</i>


540
00:46:07.443 --> 00:46:09.578
Figures to me
the mob found him.


541
00:46:09.646 --> 00:46:13.548
Diamond was with the boys
in cleveland, chicago, detroit.


542
00:46:13.616 --> 00:46:17.219
Why would the mob wanna
kill the president?
Business reasons.


543
00:46:17.287 --> 00:46:20.923
Heard a very big man
in the syndicate
say one day that...


544
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:25.727
Kegan took $2 million
in campaign contributions
from the boys and then...


545
00:46:25.795 --> 00:46:27.729
Didn't do anything
about it.


546
00:46:27.797 --> 00:46:32.601
Nonsense. Tim didn't
need the money.


547
00:46:32.669 --> 00:46:34.937
Who knows.

548
00:46:35.005 --> 00:46:38.340
Anyway,
whoever did it still has
a terrific amount of clout...


549
00:46:38.408 --> 00:46:40.342
19 years
after it happened.


550
00:46:41.778 --> 00:46:43.712
Yeah.

551
00:46:58.211 --> 00:47:00.879
Hello?
you're home!


552
00:47:00.946 --> 00:47:02.948
Nick?
Oh, wonderful.


553
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:05.934
<i>I've been trying
to reach you for days.</i>


554
00:47:06.002 --> 00:47:08.503
Where are you?
Grand central.
I'm, uh-


555
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:11.339
I'm on my way over, okay?
Okay. I can't wait.


556
00:47:11.407 --> 00:47:13.341
yvette-

557
00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:16.545
Oh, I got something to tell you.
I can't believe you're real!


558
00:47:16.612 --> 00:47:20.949
Yeah, well, I'm not real.
I'm just a more complicated
new machine.


559
00:47:21.017 --> 00:47:23.152
You're what?

560
00:47:23.219 --> 00:47:26.621
You come on over
and see what this
new machine can do.


561
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:30.092
I'm on my way.
I can't wait.


562
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.295
I love you.
Then come and get me.


563
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.868
<i>oh, shh! Somebody's
gonna call the police!</i>


564
00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:44.990
Shh. Shh.

565
00:47:45.058 --> 00:47:47.993
Shh!

566
00:47:48.061 --> 00:47:50.328
Marry me.
Marry me!


567
00:47:55.134 --> 00:47:57.436
Shh. Shh. Shh.

568
00:47:59.972 --> 00:48:03.141
Oh, marry me.
Marry me!


569
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.480
Yes! Yes! Oh, god, yes!

570
00:48:09.899 --> 00:48:11.833
Oh, you make me so happy.

571
00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:18.406
Shh. Come on.
Somebody's gonna
call the police.


572
00:48:18.474 --> 00:48:20.642
Shh.

573
00:48:44.617 --> 00:48:47.619
hi.
Hi.


574
00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:57.596
- When should we do it?
- Let me rest a minute first.


575
00:49:00.015 --> 00:49:01.950
No, I mean get married.

576
00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:05.554
Get married?
You just said yes.


577
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:09.023
Oh, I always say yes
at those times.


578
00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:11.693
You know I can't marry you.

579
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.695
What?

580
00:49:13.762 --> 00:49:16.264
Come on. Up.

581
00:49:23.306 --> 00:49:25.240
Ah, be right back.

582
00:49:25.308 --> 00:49:28.009
- Why won't you marry me?
- You hardly know me.


583
00:49:28.077 --> 00:49:32.213
We see each other.
I talk to you all the time.
You talk to my machine.


584
00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:37.436
<i>- Oh, so what.
I can tell the difference.
- That's a beginning.</i>


585
00:49:37.471 --> 00:49:41.223
I'm making an honest
proposal of marriage.


586
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:43.508
Tell you what.

587
00:49:43.576 --> 00:49:47.145
I'll give you a copy
of my answering machine tape.
You can take it with you.


588
00:49:47.213 --> 00:49:49.581
Come on.
Don't toy with me.


589
00:49:49.649 --> 00:49:53.218
I'm serious.

590
00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:55.721
We'll have this huge wedding
in saint patrick's cathedral.


591
00:49:55.788 --> 00:49:59.458
Saint patrick's?
What if I'm jewish?


592
00:49:59.525 --> 00:50:02.260
That doesn't matter.
Pa knows the cardinal.


593
00:50:02.328 --> 00:50:04.696
You see, darling.
You know nothing about me.


594
00:50:06.282 --> 00:50:08.217
I know all I need to know.

595
00:50:08.284 --> 00:50:11.787
<i>You know what?
That you're in love
with my answering machine.</i>


596
00:50:11.855 --> 00:50:14.056
Well, I'll know you
better later on.


597
00:50:16.142 --> 00:50:18.743
Do you know
what I do for a living?


598
00:50:18.811 --> 00:50:23.148
- That doesn't matter. You will
never have to work again.
- But I wanna work.


599
00:50:23.216 --> 00:50:25.417
<i>I'm assistant editor
at national magazine.</i>


600
00:50:25.485 --> 00:50:28.487
Maybe pa owns it.
Do you want a promotion?


601
00:50:28.554 --> 00:50:31.323
I want my own life
too, nick.


602
00:50:31.391 --> 00:50:34.526
- Well, I'll buy you
whatever you want.
- No.


603
00:50:36.129 --> 00:50:38.130
You just said no.
I said no.


604
00:50:40.065 --> 00:50:42.300
How can you say
a thing like that?


605
00:50:42.368 --> 00:50:44.302
Why complicate things?

606
00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:48.273
We have great sex, freedom,
no kids, no responsibilities.


607
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.776
Why duplicate
the messes others make?


608
00:50:50.843 --> 00:50:54.746
- But we don't have to.
- We can make a mess
of our own?


609
00:50:54.781 --> 00:50:58.650
- Who knows what will happen?
- Don't ask me anymore, nick.


610
00:50:58.717 --> 00:51:02.987
I adore you. I really do.
But the answer's
gonna stay the same.


611
00:51:03.055 --> 00:51:07.392
I'd tell you why
if I could but I can't.


612
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.462
Don't say you can't.
Say you don't want.


613
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.632
I don't want.

614
00:51:16.936 --> 00:51:20.472
Then forget it.
All right.


615
00:51:25.111 --> 00:51:28.180
I think
I'd better leave.
If you want to.


616
00:51:28.247 --> 00:51:31.816
I have a friend coming over
if you'd like to meet her.


617
00:51:31.884 --> 00:51:35.220
A friend? Who?
Patty. She's from
the magazine. You'd dig her.


618
00:51:35.287 --> 00:51:38.974
- Dig her? What does that mean?
- Whatever you want it to mean.


619
00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:40.976
God, you're just
like the others.


620
00:51:41.043 --> 00:51:44.879
Others?
How many are there?


621
00:51:44.947 --> 00:51:47.316
Fewer and fewer.

622
00:51:49.586 --> 00:51:51.520
Oh, I get it.
You're into women.


623
00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:55.491
- I am a woman.
- You know what
I'm talking about.


624
00:51:55.558 --> 00:51:59.060
Nope. And I won't marry
a person I can't understand.


625
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:03.665
Good night.

626
00:52:05.602 --> 00:52:08.703
Call the machine
whenever you want, darling.
It only goes one way.


627
00:52:16.612 --> 00:52:19.948
Mr. Wilson?
Good evening.


628
00:52:20.016 --> 00:52:22.283
Mr. Kegan. This is
a pleasant surprise.


629
00:52:22.351 --> 00:52:24.820
Can I have my key,
please?
Certainly.


630
00:52:26.322 --> 00:52:29.223
My, you're looking...
Worse than I've
ever seen you, sir.


631
00:52:31.894 --> 00:52:34.195
I've been traveling.
It certainly doesn't
agree with you.


632
00:52:34.263 --> 00:52:36.197
Good night.
Good night.


633
00:52:36.265 --> 00:52:39.768
I'll alert the staff
that you're in residence.
And get some sleep.


634
00:52:44.073 --> 00:52:46.374
Welcome home, nick.
It's good to see you.


635
00:52:46.442 --> 00:52:50.345
Good to see you too,
raymond.


636
00:52:50.413 --> 00:52:53.948
The maid is freshening
your room, sir.


637
00:52:54.016 --> 00:52:56.617
Get me a double,
please, raymond.


638
00:52:56.685 --> 00:52:58.619
A double what, sir?

639
00:53:00.423 --> 00:53:02.824
Uh, on second thought,
make it triple.


640
00:53:02.891 --> 00:53:05.427
A triple what, sir?

641
00:53:30.536 --> 00:53:34.973
Hello.
This is yvette malone speaking.
I'm not home just now.


642
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.410
I hate this machine!
Leave your name
and telephone number,


643
00:53:38.478 --> 00:53:42.648
I'll call you when I return.
Please begin at the tone.


644
00:53:44.183 --> 00:53:46.718
Hello, yvette, listen,
I'm sorry I was so, uh, rude.


645
00:53:46.786 --> 00:53:49.954
I didn't, you know,
listen to you or anything.


646
00:53:50.022 --> 00:53:54.359
I want you to know
that I still care about you
and I wanna see you.


647
00:53:54.427 --> 00:53:57.462
Why don't we have lunch tomorrow
at the lorraine, huh? 12:30.


648
00:54:01.167 --> 00:54:03.101
Nicholas?

649
00:54:30.879 --> 00:54:34.316
Help! Help! Help!

650
00:54:34.383 --> 00:54:36.551
Raymond!

651
00:54:36.618 --> 00:54:39.687
I brought your drink, sir.

652
00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:54.335
Hello. This is nick kegan.
A maid just left my room.
Have security stop her, please.


653
00:54:54.403 --> 00:54:56.404
She tried to kill me.

654
00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:18.176
Sorry I'm late.

655
00:55:20.312 --> 00:55:24.582
I'm glad you came.
Well, me too. I hate saying
good-bye to a naked man.


656
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:30.589
Excuse me.

657
00:55:35.578 --> 00:55:38.613
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
We'd like a table, please.


658
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:41.750
For the two of you?
Yeah, someplace we can talk.


659
00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:46.705
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We don't allow ladies
in trousers in the dining area.


660
00:55:46.772 --> 00:55:50.108
You what?
Uh, it's no problem.


661
00:55:50.175 --> 00:55:52.243
You know what happened
to me this morning?


662
00:55:52.311 --> 00:55:55.480
I go out of the taxi,
and the cabdriver followed
me on the sidewalk,


663
00:55:55.547 --> 00:55:59.467
Swearing at me because
he didn't think
I tipped him enough.


664
00:55:59.502 --> 00:56:03.237
<i>Madam, we will
have to ask you to leave.</i>


665
00:56:03.305 --> 00:56:05.940
We're staying, my friend.
She's got you.


666
00:56:06.008 --> 00:56:08.710
impossible.

667
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.916
My name is nicholas kegan.
My father owns this place.


668
00:56:14.984 --> 00:56:18.670
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, sir.

669
00:56:19.271 --> 00:56:22.924
I didn't recognize you.
Please, right this way.


670
00:56:22.992 --> 00:56:24.993
Right this way.
Thank you.


671
00:56:35.637 --> 00:56:39.407
Listen, I'm, uh-
I'm sorry about last night.
No, I'm sorry.


672
00:56:39.474 --> 00:56:43.244
I got about six different
kinds of jet lag.
No, I understand.


673
00:56:43.311 --> 00:56:46.014
Tell me, where were you
one week ago today?


674
00:56:46.081 --> 00:56:49.083
Uh, brisbane, australia.

675
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:51.085
Oh, brisbane.

676
00:56:51.153 --> 00:56:53.288
The coral sea, stonefish,

677
00:56:53.355 --> 00:56:56.391
Captain cook
sweeping north through
that treacherous channel.


678
00:56:58.561 --> 00:57:01.062
Oh, that's beautiful.

679
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.699
Yeah. Look, yvette-

680
00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:08.703
I still wanna marry you.

681
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:10.906
Is that why this lunch?

682
00:57:10.973 --> 00:57:12.974
No.

683
00:57:13.042 --> 00:57:15.343
I need
your magazine's help.


684
00:57:15.411 --> 00:57:17.345
Maybe
it's your magazine.


685
00:57:19.782 --> 00:57:23.151
I need to contact
someone in the mob-
someone big.


686
00:57:23.218 --> 00:57:25.419
What for?
It is not to be
talked about.


687
00:57:25.487 --> 00:57:27.421
I cross my heart.

688
00:57:27.489 --> 00:57:30.558
<i>I also need everything
in your files on joe diamond.
Joe diamond?</i>


689
00:57:30.625 --> 00:57:33.161
Who he knew in the mob.
Who knew him.


690
00:57:33.228 --> 00:57:36.230
What for? Does it
concern your brother?


691
00:57:36.298 --> 00:57:40.835
We have reason to believe
that we're on the track
of uncovering a conspiracy.


692
00:57:40.903 --> 00:57:43.504
A conspiracy?

693
00:57:45.307 --> 00:57:48.576
Three days ago,

694
00:57:48.644 --> 00:57:52.213
I met the true assassin
of my brother.


695
00:57:52.281 --> 00:57:57.352
Is this on the level?
Now I want to find out
who actually hired diamond.


696
00:57:57.419 --> 00:58:00.522
Not the go-between.
I wanna find the man
who is responsible for this.


697
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.942
Well, sure.
It'll cost.


698
00:58:04.009 --> 00:58:07.278
It cost to have
my brother killed. I think
we can pay whatever it cost...


699
00:58:07.346 --> 00:58:11.816
To find those who-
who did it to him.


700
00:58:11.884 --> 00:58:14.719
And I don't want
any press until I say so.


701
00:58:14.786 --> 00:58:16.721
Are you offering us
the exclusive?


702
00:58:18.824 --> 00:58:20.758
Thank you.

703
00:58:20.826 --> 00:58:23.228
If you come up
with the contacts.


704
00:58:23.295 --> 00:58:25.863
Wow. This is big.

705
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:29.500
I mean, really big.
Hey, wow!


706
00:58:29.568 --> 00:58:32.220
you know,

707
00:58:32.287 --> 00:58:34.755
When I'm with you, the-

708
00:58:34.823 --> 00:58:37.408
- Wow!
- Yvette?


709
00:58:37.476 --> 00:58:39.544
Yvette-

710
00:58:39.612 --> 00:58:43.180
You know, tim-

711
00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:45.416
He had thousands of women,
and I've, uh-


712
00:58:45.484 --> 00:58:47.418
I've actually
only had twelve.


713
00:58:47.486 --> 00:58:51.623
And I know that may
seem conservative to you.


714
00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:54.859
Oh, listen, honey.
You get me this story,
I'll get you all you want.


715
00:58:54.927 --> 00:58:57.745
Are you listening to me?

716
00:58:57.813 --> 00:59:03.134
I sure am.
And if you want this story,
I gotta get my tail in gear.


717
00:59:03.201 --> 00:59:05.637
I call you
from the magazine.
Thanks for lunch.


718
00:59:05.704 --> 00:59:08.472
Lunch?
This news makes my day.
It's wonderful.


719
00:59:09.608 --> 00:59:11.542
Excuse me.

720
00:59:15.664 --> 00:59:19.934
What the hell were you
doing with that broad
at lunch today?


721
00:59:20.002 --> 00:59:23.171
She's a friend of mine.
Are you screwing her?


722
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.109
Oh, I forgot.
You're the boy scout
of the family.


723
00:59:28.177 --> 00:59:30.428
Tim always shared
information
on his broads.


724
00:59:30.496 --> 00:59:34.431
<i>I'm not tim.
Where'd you meet her?</i>


725
00:59:34.499 --> 00:59:36.467
Keifitz introduced us
in paris one weekend.


726
00:59:36.535 --> 00:59:38.870
She's the press.
I said no press.


727
00:59:38.937 --> 00:59:41.623
I need contacts
with the mob.


728
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:45.193
I'm in business,
for christ's sake. Been dealing
with the mob for years.


729
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:49.163
But you go to some dame
you got the hots for
and spill everything.


730
00:59:49.198 --> 00:59:52.283
<i>That's wrong.
Like hell.</i>


731
00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:55.153
Cerruti played the whole lunch
to me ten minutes ago.


732
00:59:56.588 --> 00:59:58.689
- You had us bugged?
- It's my restaurant, son.


733
00:59:58.757 --> 01:00:01.625
A lot of people
more important than you
make deals there.


734
01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:03.895
<i>Of course
I have it bugged.</i>


735
01:00:03.962 --> 01:00:06.397
Telephone for you,
sir.


736
01:00:06.464 --> 01:00:09.400
I'll take it in my room.
Take it here.


737
01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:11.635
Cerruti's
recording it
anyhow.


738
01:00:14.039 --> 01:00:16.074
Hello.

739
01:00:16.141 --> 01:00:18.843
Hello, yvette.

740
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:20.845
You what?
Already?


741
01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:23.247
Yeah, you sure do.

742
01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:25.416
how much?

743
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:29.520
Who is it?

744
01:00:29.588 --> 01:00:31.923
Uh-huh.
Cleveland.


745
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.991
All right.
I'll catch the next plane.


746
01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:36.127
And thanks.

747
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:41.332
Who are you meeting?
Someone named
irving mentor.


748
01:00:41.399 --> 01:00:44.268
Yvette says
he's the magazine's
direct line to the mob.


749
01:00:45.788 --> 01:00:49.440
I'll check on him.
I got something for you.


750
01:00:49.508 --> 01:00:54.245
Whatcha scared of?
I don't want you in any more
situations you can't handle.


751
01:00:54.312 --> 01:00:56.864
- I don't want a gun.
- Look,


752
01:00:56.932 --> 01:00:59.133
Somebody tried
to kill you last night.


753
01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.135
This ain't
no treasure hunt
you're on.


754
01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:04.105
Pa, I'm not
gonna carry a gun.


755
01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:06.874
I admire the way
you fought off
that killer, boy.


756
01:01:06.942 --> 01:01:09.577
Single-handedly.
It was only the maid.


757
01:01:09.645 --> 01:01:12.730
Ah, trained killer.
We got her, by the way.
We got her?


758
01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:14.732
Yeah.
Working her over now.


759
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.302
My people are on this
all the way.


760
01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:20.305
All right. If you won't
carry a gun, take this.


761
01:01:22.524 --> 01:01:25.326
For my peace of mind
if nothing else.


762
01:01:26.362 --> 01:01:28.296
You're amazing.

763
01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:31.165
Take these, uh,
brass knuckles too.


764
01:01:31.233 --> 01:01:34.935
Uh, don't lose them.
They have
a sentimental value.


765
01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:38.939
Thanks.

766
01:01:39.007 --> 01:01:42.810
Uh, I'll see you
in cleveland.
I'll be in the hospital.


767
01:01:42.878 --> 01:01:45.580
Oh, nothing's wrong.
Six-months' blood change is all.


768
01:01:45.647 --> 01:01:47.748
- Blood change?
- Yeah.


769
01:01:47.816 --> 01:01:51.452
I take it from the kids
at amherst. Got a deal
with the red cross.


770
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.687
Uh, for the circulation.

771
01:01:54.823 --> 01:01:57.124
I'll see you, pa.

772
01:01:57.192 --> 01:01:59.126
<i>Call me from cleveland.</i>

773
01:02:14.593 --> 01:02:16.594
I'm looking
for irving mentor.


774
01:02:16.662 --> 01:02:18.696
Never heard of him.

775
01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:22.200
Uh, my name
is nick kegan.


776
01:02:59.805 --> 01:03:01.806
I bought you
coffee.


777
01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:05.310
Cream?
No, thanks.


778
01:03:06.312 --> 01:03:08.313
You got the cash?

779
01:03:13.986 --> 01:03:16.487
Better count it.
Humph.
You bet your ass.


780
01:03:29.685 --> 01:03:31.785
Okay.

781
01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:39.327
The contract for the hit
came from gameboy baker.


782
01:03:40.812 --> 01:03:44.231
- Gameboy baker.
- You got it.


783
01:03:44.299 --> 01:03:46.968
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
Sorry.


784
01:03:47.036 --> 01:03:48.903
This ain't
a social visit.
Oh, yeah?


785
01:03:48.971 --> 01:03:52.623
It's not worth 15 grand,
either. Now sit down.


786
01:03:52.691 --> 01:03:55.193
Sit down
or give me my money back.


787
01:03:55.228 --> 01:03:58.462
Watch your language.
These are my boys, you know.


788
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.049
<i>get out of here.</i>

789
01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:10.791
Tell me about this, uh,
gameboy baker.


790
01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:15.730
Joe diamond is from
the old neighborhood.


791
01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:19.867
Small-time thief.
No sense.


792
01:04:19.935 --> 01:04:23.337
¶

793
01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:25.339
it was gameboy baker...

794
01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:27.675
Who helped set joe up
in his nightclub.


795
01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:32.280
Only joe wasn't paying back.
He was too busy supporting
some of the local rookies.


796
01:04:32.347 --> 01:04:34.916
I was the one
who delivered the message.


797
01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:38.752
That moey and sam
and morris and uncle louie
wanted a conversation with him.


798
01:04:40.822 --> 01:04:43.324
so joe skipped to cuba.

799
01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:45.593
And by the time
the boys found him,


800
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.762
He was in bed
with every faigelah
politician in havana.


801
01:04:50.933 --> 01:04:53.868
joe took protection
from his cuban friend...


802
01:04:53.936 --> 01:04:56.370
And went back
to his club in philly.


803
01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:58.472
But he still owed the boys
an obligation,


804
01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.575
Which he paid back on that day
he shot willy arnold.


805
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.865
Open that door.
The smoke's
getting to me.


806
01:05:07.933 --> 01:05:10.868
That could be a signal
or something.


807
01:05:10.936 --> 01:05:14.605
Open the door
or I'll shove the cigar
down your throat.


808
01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:17.875
Eighty-five cents,
wholesale.


809
01:05:17.943 --> 01:05:20.744
Now, who is casper jr.?
A hollywood agent.


810
01:05:22.114 --> 01:05:26.116
What?
Deals for harry small,
head of federal studios.


811
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:31.405
Why would people like that
wanna kill a president?


812
01:05:31.473 --> 01:05:35.075
That particular president
cost that studio...


813
01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:37.912
$50 million...

814
01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.816
When he stopped
screwing ellamae irving
and she killed herself.


815
01:05:41.884 --> 01:05:45.486
I give you $15,000
and you tell me gossip.


816
01:05:45.554 --> 01:05:48.422
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.


817
01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.992
What can I tell you?

818
01:05:52.594 --> 01:05:55.262
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Just a moment.


819
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.249
What the hell?

820
01:06:04.072 --> 01:06:08.342
What are you feeding us?
The cat's dead. What is this?


821
01:06:48.533 --> 01:06:52.536
calling dr. Rogers.
Telephone call, dr. Rogers.


822
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.487
My father's
a patient here.


823
01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:12.823
Your name?

824
01:07:12.891 --> 01:07:15.059
Nicholas kegan.

825
01:07:17.395 --> 01:07:19.396
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

826
01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:26.120
Federal studios? Hell,
you couldn't spot a nigger
in a snowbank.


827
01:07:26.188 --> 01:07:29.923
I'm telling you what he said.
I got interlocking companies
controlling federal.


828
01:07:29.991 --> 01:07:34.095
Her last two pictures
lost money. Harry small was glad
to get out of her contract.


829
01:07:34.162 --> 01:07:35.930
<i>You gotta stop
chasing mare tails, boy.</i>


830
01:07:35.998 --> 01:07:38.682
I fixed up
a meeting for you
with frank mayo.


831
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:41.352
- Mayo?
- Heard of him, huh?


832
01:07:41.419 --> 01:07:43.687
Grand vizier
of the underworld.


833
01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:46.256
I thought he was in jail.
Upstate,
maximum security.


834
01:07:46.324 --> 01:07:48.659
I got him out
to meet you
this afternoon.


835
01:07:48.727 --> 01:07:50.994
What can he tell me
that mentor didn't know?


836
01:07:51.062 --> 01:07:54.965
What did mentor know? Nothing.
You tell that broad of yours
she owes you 15 grand.


837
01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:58.185
- Have a pastry?
- Think that sugar's
good for you?


838
01:07:58.253 --> 01:08:01.372
It's my hospital.

839
01:08:01.439 --> 01:08:05.042
Own what you use.
Nothing competes today
with owning a hospital.


840
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:09.330
No customer credit.
Pay in advance or get out.
Unique product- pain.


841
01:08:09.398 --> 01:08:13.984
Laundry alone throws off enough
to pay the orderlies and lab.
And what the lab turns over-


842
01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:17.571
- When is the meeting with mayo?
- I'm talking business here.


843
01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:20.408
You should see the net
on what the lab throws off.


844
01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:23.510
I own 27 hospitals
in 15 major cities.
Wish I had more.


845
01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:25.896
Where is the meeting
with frank mayo, pa?


846
01:08:25.963 --> 01:08:29.232
Grant's tomb, 4:00.

847
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.234
<i>Hey, nick.</i>

848
01:08:32.236 --> 01:08:34.538
Uh, would you
like a little?


849
01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:43.664
No, thanks, pa.

850
01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.533
Please, sit down.

851
01:09:29.611 --> 01:09:33.981
Uh, pa says that you
have some information
on joe diamond.


852
01:09:34.048 --> 01:09:36.484
Oh, yeah, but...

853
01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:39.653
Before we get into that,
I, uh-


854
01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:42.256
I wanna tell you
that I'm apologetic
about-


855
01:09:42.324 --> 01:09:45.226
About what happened
to your brother,
even at this late date.


856
01:09:46.561 --> 01:09:49.330
But, uh, unfortunately,
mr. Kegan,


857
01:09:49.398 --> 01:09:51.665
You always hear
about these things
too late.


858
01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:55.603
<i>I was on key biscayne
at the time.</i>


859
01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:59.607
But I could have done nothing,
anyway, because, uh,
it wasn't our business, see?


860
01:09:59.674 --> 01:10:01.608
They, uh-
they did it on their own.


861
01:10:01.676 --> 01:10:04.828
Mr. Mayo,

862
01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:08.398
Who actually made the contract
to kill the president?


863
01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:10.834
see what I mean?

864
01:10:12.437 --> 01:10:15.305
That, for me,
has always been a mystery.
I don't know.


865
01:10:19.243 --> 01:10:21.945
What about diamond's
connections in cuba?


866
01:10:22.013 --> 01:10:24.682
Diamond had no connections
in cuba.


867
01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:27.117
Well, irving mentor
says he did.


868
01:10:29.353 --> 01:10:32.189
Irving mentor.

869
01:10:32.256 --> 01:10:34.191
Mm-mmm.
I never heard of him.


870
01:10:34.258 --> 01:10:37.895
<i>Who send you to this, uh,
to this mentor man?</i>


871
01:10:39.313 --> 01:10:41.532
A friend.

872
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.034
Mm.

873
01:10:44.102 --> 01:10:46.604
That's funny.

874
01:10:46.672 --> 01:10:49.106
No, no, no.
No, diamond was
never in cuba.


875
01:10:49.174 --> 01:10:51.876
I'm told he was out of-
out of chicago.


876
01:10:53.111 --> 01:10:55.279
Mr. Kegan, uh,

877
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.016
You're getting
the runaround here.


878
01:11:10.512 --> 01:11:14.898
I'm sorry, sir.
Personnel has no record
of any yvette malone.


879
01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:17.284
She works here.
Apparently not.


880
01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:23.157
Could you check again?
I mean, you must
have a record of her.


881
01:11:23.224 --> 01:11:26.911
Sir, this is
national magazine.


882
01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:29.914
Everything we must have,
we have.


883
01:11:33.401 --> 01:11:35.486
Thank you.

884
01:11:42.894 --> 01:11:47.714
It's no good, mister.
The lady in 12-g
is 62 years old.


885
01:11:47.782 --> 01:11:51.418
Drinks like a fish.
But yvette lived here.
I visited her here.


886
01:11:51.486 --> 01:11:54.421
Why don't you try number 86?
Maybe you got
the wrong building.


887
01:11:54.756 --> 01:11:57.090
You have nobody
of that description?


888
01:11:57.158 --> 01:12:02.229
Buddy, we haven't
had a good-looking woman
in this building in four years.


889
01:12:02.297 --> 01:12:05.032
Floor upon floor
of ugly people
is all we got.


890
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.285
Here's 50 bucks.
I gotta find her.


891
01:12:09.354 --> 01:12:11.288
Make it a hundred.

892
01:12:11.356 --> 01:12:13.958
I'll tell you
everything I know.


893
01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:16.293
Okay.
Here's a hundred.


894
01:12:16.361 --> 01:12:18.295
I already told you
everything I know.


895
01:12:18.363 --> 01:12:22.065
No such person
ever occupied these premises!


896
01:12:22.133 --> 01:12:24.802
- Look here, mister.
- Now, hold on, cocksucker.


897
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.871
You can't buy me, huh?

898
01:12:26.938 --> 01:12:31.825
You don't accept my word for it,
you deserve to pay. Now,
get the hell out of my si-


899
01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:35.612
Come on! Come on!
I'll bop your skull open,
you bastard, you!


900
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.082
Your money can't buy me, huh?
You give me the creeps.
Get out of here!


901
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.453
Go on!
Filthy bastard, you.


902
01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:45.539
You give me the creeps,
all of you! Go on!


903
01:12:47.559 --> 01:12:49.493
Then I'll say
good night, sir.


904
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:51.495
Oh, uh, raymond.
Sir?


905
01:12:51.563 --> 01:12:54.765
Do we have any ovaltine?
Ovaltine?


906
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:58.002
I think I'd like some
before I go to sleep
tonight.


907
01:12:58.069 --> 01:13:03.007
I seem to remember when
I was a kid I had this cup
with a borden's cow on it.


908
01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:05.676
Cow, sir?

909
01:13:05.744 --> 01:13:07.845
Oh, just give me
a glass of milk.


910
01:13:07.913 --> 01:13:09.880
Very good, sir.

911
01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:44.765
Boy! I have
come back for you!


912
01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:46.984
Now, wait!

913
01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:48.952
Wait! Hey!

914
01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.571
<i>Hey! Wakey, wakey, wakey!</i>

915
01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:53.673
<i>It's me!</i>

916
01:13:55.543 --> 01:13:58.178
- You're a dead ghost!
- Like hell I am.


917
01:13:58.246 --> 01:14:01.014
<i>Pa said you're dead.
Do I look dead?</i>


918
01:14:01.082 --> 01:14:03.016
<i>I need some sleep, but...</i>

919
01:14:03.084 --> 01:14:06.987
They're still
dredging for my body
and I've still got it.


920
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:12.926
<i>- Then you're not dead.
- No. I got an obit
in the times...</i>


921
01:14:14.395 --> 01:14:16.330
But I am not dead.

922
01:14:16.397 --> 01:14:18.332
Now, when they
got the medic,


923
01:14:18.399 --> 01:14:21.918
I figured
it was healthier
not to be alive.


924
01:14:21.986 --> 01:14:24.488
yeah.

925
01:14:25.757 --> 01:14:28.825
Ain't you
glad to see me?


926
01:14:33.398 --> 01:14:36.383
It's a conundrum-

927
01:14:36.451 --> 01:14:38.485
Riddles within riddles.

928
01:14:38.553 --> 01:14:41.037
Now yvette's gone.

929
01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:43.923
That broad we met in paris?
The one you kept calling?


930
01:14:43.991 --> 01:14:47.827
- I wanna marry her.
- You're gonna give
the whole thing up?


931
01:14:47.895 --> 01:14:52.098
Someone is trying to teach me
a lesson in futility. Why am I
the only one who wasn't killed?


932
01:14:55.019 --> 01:14:57.454
They will run you dizzy.

933
01:14:57.522 --> 01:15:00.090
They will pile falsehood
on top of falsehood...


934
01:15:00.158 --> 01:15:04.094
Until you can't
tell a lie from the truth
and you won't even want to.


935
01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:07.998
That's how the powerful
keep their power.
Don't you read the papers?


936
01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:12.318
<i>You've got to accept
that there is a world
outside of you...</i>


937
01:15:12.386 --> 01:15:14.320
And that
you affect that world.


938
01:15:14.388 --> 01:15:17.491
- Your dad knows it.
- Pa thinks, uh,


939
01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:20.494
Moses lied about
the ten commandments,
because what god really said...


940
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:22.913
Was, "do what you want,
but don't get caught."


941
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:27.551
- Pa's awareness is global.
- Yeah, so is mud.


942
01:15:27.618 --> 01:15:30.637
Nick, use him.
Use the organization.


943
01:15:30.704 --> 01:15:33.657
He's got more clout
than the common market,


944
01:15:33.724 --> 01:15:37.227
And you're taking
the advice of a broad
who's probably a plant.


945
01:15:37.295 --> 01:15:39.396
Now, you could've
been killed in that diner.


946
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.670
- I thought you liked
staying alive.
- come on.


947
01:15:54.412 --> 01:15:58.515
I'm gonna find her.
Go to cerruti.
He works for you, remember?


948
01:16:00.418 --> 01:16:02.836
- What about you?
- I'm gonna stay dead
for awhile.


949
01:16:02.903 --> 01:16:04.838
I feel healthier that way.

950
01:16:08.843 --> 01:16:12.429
<i>Where are you going?
Gonna order cerruti
to produce yvette.</i>


951
01:16:18.119 --> 01:16:20.487
This is the contract silo, nick.

952
01:16:20.555 --> 01:16:22.823
Contracts, contracts,
contracts.


953
01:16:22.891 --> 01:16:25.225
Agreements kept.
Agreements broken.


954
01:16:25.293 --> 01:16:27.227
Papers, papers, papers.

955
01:16:27.295 --> 01:16:30.163
Signatures. Your father's
holograph signature...


956
01:16:30.231 --> 01:16:33.834
On his interlocking companies
going back, oh, 30 years.


957
01:16:33.902 --> 01:16:36.837
Also those of diplomats,
authors and inventors.


958
01:16:36.905 --> 01:16:38.839
Tax deals.
Foundation deals.


959
01:16:38.907 --> 01:16:41.408
Signatures of presidents
and sheiks.


960
01:16:41.475 --> 01:16:44.077
Signatures to put men away
for, oh, decades.


961
01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:47.280
Destroy careers, public lives,
marriages, estates.


962
01:16:47.348 --> 01:16:51.568
Love affairs. Letters
of passion, indiscretion
and conspiracy...


963
01:16:51.636 --> 01:16:54.237
Acquired by your father's
intelligence network.


964
01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:59.142
Letters to persuade a man
to close a deal or leave a job
or sell out on his brother.


965
01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.145
Data necessary to sustain
a financial empire.


966
01:17:02.213 --> 01:17:04.581
and here-

967
01:17:04.649 --> 01:17:09.820
Here are the spoken words.
Shh. Voices and sounds.


968
01:17:11.356 --> 01:17:15.942
And visuals.
Pictures on microfilm.
Movies. Video.


969
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.878
Marvelous little gadgets
that document verbatim...


970
01:17:18.946 --> 01:17:21.448
All your father's conversations
with all his people.


971
01:17:21.516 --> 01:17:24.284
And his people's
conversations with others.


972
01:17:24.352 --> 01:17:26.286
From our satellite,
we can watch everything.


973
01:17:26.354 --> 01:17:29.956
Nasty little wars in africa.
Troop movements. Ship movements.
Nuclear tests.


974
01:17:30.024 --> 01:17:31.958
The sinai.
The panama canal.


975
01:17:32.026 --> 01:17:35.295
Every little thing
to check an investment,
buy us in or out.


976
01:17:35.363 --> 01:17:37.464
Even tonight,
while most of
our workers sleep,


977
01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:39.700
<i>It goes on.</i>

978
01:17:42.103 --> 01:17:44.638
take a coffee break,
gentlemen.


979
01:17:44.706 --> 01:17:47.608
I have a rare visitor
and we'd like to be alone.


980
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:51.645
Information.
Black holes
of information.


981
01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:56.149
Galaxies within galaxies.
Multiple expanding universes
of information.


982
01:17:57.985 --> 01:18:00.053
Aren't you glad
you came?


983
01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:03.823
Pa never allowed the family
here in his office.


984
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:06.326
Ah. Misjudgment.
You'll run all this
someday.


985
01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:08.328
You'll need to know.

986
01:18:08.396 --> 01:18:10.830
All this and you couldn't
find my brother's killer?


987
01:18:10.898 --> 01:18:13.600
<i>I'm so glad you're here.
I receive so few outsiders.</i>


988
01:18:13.668 --> 01:18:15.602
<i>Who to trust?
Who to trust?</i>


989
01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.437
All the nerves
but none of the flesh.


990
01:18:26.981 --> 01:18:30.183
End of our social.
Why did you come here
without an appointment?


991
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:33.687
What do you want?
I want to find
yvette malone.


992
01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:36.890
Impossible.
She's been kidnapped.
Kidnapped?


993
01:18:37.692 --> 01:18:40.376
Yeah. Abducted, swept away,
taken off, snatched-
kidnapped.


994
01:18:40.444 --> 01:18:45.281
- By whom?
- The kidnappers.
Bad guys. Casper jr.


995
01:18:47.585 --> 01:18:50.754
where are you going?

996
01:18:50.822 --> 01:18:53.690
To find my father.

997
01:18:53.758 --> 01:18:56.360
I just realized.

998
01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:59.029
He's been keeping me alive.
He's protecting me.


999
01:18:59.096 --> 01:19:01.131
She's... Involved, nick.

1000
01:19:02.767 --> 01:19:05.335
Miss malone's involved.

1001
01:19:05.403 --> 01:19:08.605
It wasn't the tubesters
who got to diamond.
We have new information.


1002
01:19:08.672 --> 01:19:11.041
- While you sleep, we continue.
- Who was it?


1003
01:19:11.108 --> 01:19:14.093
You met the man this afternoon.
Frank mayo.


1004
01:19:14.161 --> 01:19:17.731
And it was lola comante
who got to mayo
and had the president killed.


1005
01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:20.801
¶

1006
01:19:23.103 --> 01:19:26.105
Miss lola comante!

1007
01:19:28.943 --> 01:19:32.345
thrice married by 23,
movie queen at 30,


1008
01:19:32.413 --> 01:19:35.582
Lola entered middle age
as friend of the shady
and legit alike...


1009
01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:38.418
With the special power
of a president's procuress.


1010
01:19:38.485 --> 01:19:42.823
Lola got tim his girls,
and he blessed her
with fame and fortune.


1011
01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:52.766
Tim enjoyed her favors
and the favors of her friends...


1012
01:19:52.834 --> 01:19:54.634
In the privacy of rockrimmon.

1013
01:20:08.516 --> 01:20:10.450
Sanctioned and abetted
by your father,


1014
01:20:10.518 --> 01:20:13.036
Who occasionally
indulged in lola himself...


1015
01:20:13.103 --> 01:20:15.305
And who also had some
business connections with her.


1016
01:20:20.227 --> 01:20:24.631
Until it all ended one day when
lola tried to collect on a deal.


1017
01:20:24.699 --> 01:20:27.134
Enchanted by ambition
as she was,


1018
01:20:27.202 --> 01:20:30.137
Lola had arranged a $2 million
campaign contribution...


1019
01:20:30.205 --> 01:20:32.139
From the family of frank mayo.

1020
01:20:32.207 --> 01:20:34.374
Mayo wanted the president
to kick out castro...


1021
01:20:34.442 --> 01:20:37.311
And restore the casinos
to havana.


1022
01:20:37.378 --> 01:20:41.315
But the president was aware
of no such contribution
and no such deal.


1023
01:20:41.382 --> 01:20:44.484
It was your father
who had accepted
the money from lola.


1024
01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:55.479
When did you get
so lily-white, son?


1025
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.581
Been reading
your own press?


1026
01:20:57.648 --> 01:20:59.683
This thing's
gone to your head.


1027
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.751
Sure, I took that cash.

1028
01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:04.421
You think
you got those votes
on your good looks?


1029
01:21:04.489 --> 01:21:08.825
I bought 'em and I paid
for 'em. And when
I needed cash, I got it.


1030
01:21:08.892 --> 01:21:11.828
Now, uh,
you remember your debts.


1031
01:21:11.895 --> 01:21:15.231
You want out of this
cuban thing, you gotta
pay back another way.


1032
01:21:15.299 --> 01:21:18.901
And, uh, be nice to lola.
She's on your side.


1033
01:21:21.071 --> 01:21:25.675
Where you going?
Hey. Where you going?


1034
01:21:25.743 --> 01:21:28.678
Come back here!
I'm your father!


1035
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.255
Goddamn it!
Why do you think
I got you this job?


1036
01:21:39.323 --> 01:21:41.591
To review the fucking fleet?

1037
01:21:43.511 --> 01:21:46.546
the president broke contact with
your father on this matter...


1038
01:21:46.614 --> 01:21:48.548
And with lola as well.

1039
01:21:48.616 --> 01:21:50.617
He never spoke
to either one again.


1040
01:21:50.684 --> 01:21:52.619
<i>so tim turned against pa?</i>

1041
01:21:52.686 --> 01:21:55.388
Mm. It hurt your father
a great deal,


1042
01:21:55.456 --> 01:21:59.125
Both personally
and... Financially.


1043
01:21:59.193 --> 01:22:02.845
Then it was mayo
who killed my brother and
you've known it all along.


1044
01:22:02.913 --> 01:22:04.847
A qualified no
on both counts.


1045
01:22:04.915 --> 01:22:07.317
- Z.K. Dawson.
- The guy in the tank?


1046
01:22:07.385 --> 01:22:12.355
No, no, no. Not that asshole.
The real dawson who hasn't left
venezuela since 1956.


1047
01:22:12.423 --> 01:22:16.526
Your oklahoma adventure
was a little something
I cooked up.
You cooked up?


1048
01:22:16.593 --> 01:22:19.495
Yes. A scene. A skit.

1049
01:22:19.563 --> 01:22:22.132
Rather humorous, I thought,
with a point.


1050
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.467
And what can the point be,
mr. Cerruti?


1051
01:22:24.535 --> 01:22:29.072
You see, it wasn't
dawson himself who plotted
your brother's assassination.


1052
01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:32.909
It was his only daughter-
formerly maggie dawson,
then mrs. Luigi bellini...


1053
01:22:32.977 --> 01:22:35.645
And lately-

1054
01:22:35.713 --> 01:22:37.414
Yvette?

1055
01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:41.251
The attraction between you two
becomes romeo-and-julietish, no?
Opposing families.


1056
01:22:41.319 --> 01:22:45.288
- That is ridiculous!
- Don't snap at me, you.


1057
01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:49.509
She plotted the whole thing.
She was your brother's mistress
too. Bet you didn't know that.


1058
01:22:49.576 --> 01:22:53.580
- Where is she now?
- Yvette? I told you.
Kidnapped.


1059
01:22:53.648 --> 01:22:57.116
- By whom?
- By whom? By the kidnappers.


1060
01:22:57.184 --> 01:22:59.753
Bad guys. Casper jr.

1061
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.889
you are lying, cerruti.

1062
01:23:02.956 --> 01:23:05.057
No one's allowed up here,
nick.


1063
01:23:05.125 --> 01:23:08.461
Tell me where she is
or I'm gonna blow this
whole thing open.


1064
01:23:08.529 --> 01:23:11.464
No way. You're not
to be believed.
What have you got?


1065
01:23:11.532 --> 01:23:14.801
A half a dozen
different scenarios all going
in opposite directions.


1066
01:23:14.869 --> 01:23:18.872
Fantasies. They'd lock you
away in the booby bin.
You're no threat to me.


1067
01:23:20.574 --> 01:23:24.076
You give me this information
or I'm gonna get it
the old-fashioned way.


1068
01:23:24.144 --> 01:23:26.145
The ol- oh.
The old-fashioned way.


1069
01:23:26.213 --> 01:23:28.915
I see. What are you gonna do,
break my arms?


1070
01:23:28.966 --> 01:23:31.250
God, it's painful
to see you like this, nick.


1071
01:23:31.318 --> 01:23:34.387
It's painful to see you
suffering under a delusion
so intense,


1072
01:23:34.455 --> 01:23:37.290
So aggravating
that you actually believe
that you have the nerve...


1073
01:23:37.357 --> 01:23:39.526
To come in here
and threaten me like this.


1074
01:23:39.593 --> 01:23:41.594
You're just not the type.

1075
01:23:44.598 --> 01:23:47.100
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that,
you clown?


1076
01:23:47.168 --> 01:23:49.502
You've broken my arm.
Is it him?


1077
01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:51.705
Huh? Huh?
Is it pa?


1078
01:23:51.772 --> 01:23:54.057
Is it him?

1079
01:23:55.392 --> 01:23:58.394
Please tell me.
Is it pa?


1080
01:24:02.066 --> 01:24:04.067
<i>ow!</i>

1081
01:24:08.572 --> 01:24:10.573
Is it pa, cerruti?

1082
01:24:11.609 --> 01:24:13.543
Your legs are next.

1083
01:24:13.611 --> 01:24:16.446
Cerruti, is it pa?

1084
01:24:16.513 --> 01:24:19.115
Your father spent $11 million
to raise your brother up...


1085
01:24:19.183 --> 01:24:22.018
From a skirt-chasing
college boy to president
of the United States.


1086
01:24:22.086 --> 01:24:25.421
For 20 years,
he told him what to do
and how and why...


1087
01:24:25.489 --> 01:24:27.657
And what would happen
when it was done.


1088
01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:30.026
Your father put tim
in the white house. Why?


1089
01:24:30.094 --> 01:24:32.562
Because that's where you
can generate the most cash.


1090
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:36.099
A cold-ass business proposition
like everything else in society.


1091
01:24:37.434 --> 01:24:39.736
But your brother decided
to stir up the population,


1092
01:24:39.804 --> 01:24:42.372
Began to think we were
all living in a democracy.


1093
01:24:42.439 --> 01:24:45.441
He started believing it.
Lunch with de gaulle,
dinner with kruschev.


1094
01:24:45.509 --> 01:24:47.644
The whole razzle-dazzle
went to his head.


1095
01:24:47.712 --> 01:24:50.546
Yet in spite of the fact that
everybody in this country...


1096
01:24:50.614 --> 01:24:52.649
Lives in the same
dog-eat-dog way,


1097
01:24:52.717 --> 01:24:54.651
Grabbing any angle
to make a buck,


1098
01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:57.687
If you were to inform them
that your father had tim killed,


1099
01:24:57.755 --> 01:25:00.223
They'd wanna
tear the old man
apart limb from limb.


1100
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.392
Pa had-
pa had him killed?


1101
01:25:02.459 --> 01:25:05.929
What the hell?
That's the system
you wanted, nick,


1102
01:25:05.997 --> 01:25:07.931
And that's the system
you've got.


1103
01:25:07.999 --> 01:25:11.034
The whole secret,
as your father says,
is not to get caught.


1104
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:15.739
I want to find yvette.
Yvette malone...


1105
01:25:15.806 --> 01:25:18.574
Was a professional actress
named jenny o'brien,


1106
01:25:18.642 --> 01:25:21.577
But I don't think she wants
to see you today, nick.


1107
01:25:21.645 --> 01:25:25.381
She's the guest of a freshman
anatomy class over at kegan
university medical school...


1108
01:25:25.449 --> 01:25:28.518
And she's
kinda tied up right now,
if you get the picture.


1109
01:25:28.585 --> 01:25:31.821
You get the picture, nick?
You get the picture?


1110
01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:38.161
You get the picture, nick?

1111
01:26:12.029 --> 01:26:14.030
Don't touch.

1112
01:26:48.349 --> 01:26:50.550
What the hell?
He was caught
trying to enter.


1113
01:26:51.352 --> 01:26:53.986
That's my son!

1114
01:26:56.089 --> 01:26:59.826
He refused to tell us
his name, mr. Kegan.


1115
01:27:01.595 --> 01:27:05.030
Rosemary will call dr. Grokest
when she comes in.


1116
01:27:05.098 --> 01:27:07.266
You sure
made a night of it, boy.


1117
01:27:21.682 --> 01:27:24.684
You should have called first.
Ought to know that by now.


1118
01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:29.839
I'll get you some whiskey.

1119
01:27:33.277 --> 01:27:35.945
You want those fellas fired,
I'll have 'em fired.


1120
01:27:38.115 --> 01:27:40.283
Good men, though.

1121
01:27:41.619 --> 01:27:43.553
Ah. You gonna
pass out on me?


1122
01:27:43.621 --> 01:27:47.423
Pa, cerruti
told me everything.


1123
01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:51.777
- You saw cerruti?
- You killed him.


1124
01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.315
Your own son.

1125
01:28:07.661 --> 01:28:09.829
<i>Was it really
for money?</i>


1126
01:28:18.939 --> 01:28:20.923
Rosemary, where the hell
are my cigars?


1127
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:22.992
Rosemary!

1128
01:28:37.007 --> 01:28:39.508
a wise man
fools the doctors.


1129
01:28:51.188 --> 01:28:53.789
Was it for money?

1130
01:28:55.192 --> 01:28:58.294
Where did you get the balls
to suggest to me...


1131
01:28:58.362 --> 01:29:01.797
That I'd have
your brother murdered
for some additional cash?


1132
01:29:01.865 --> 01:29:04.134
The president
of my country.


1133
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:08.304
Is this an attack, son?
A conspiracy? Have you
gone over to the enemy?


1134
01:29:08.372 --> 01:29:10.640
Or are you mad?

1135
01:29:10.707 --> 01:29:12.976
for money.

1136
01:29:13.043 --> 01:29:16.913
Shame.
For shame on you.


1137
01:29:18.982 --> 01:29:21.818
Somewhere deep
in your soul, pa,


1138
01:29:21.885 --> 01:29:25.004
You wanna get caught
and punished.


1139
01:29:25.072 --> 01:29:28.207
Like a petty thief
back to the scene
of a crime.


1140
01:29:28.275 --> 01:29:33.179
Petty thief? Hell,
I'm the king of thieves,


1141
01:29:33.247 --> 01:29:35.848
The jupiter of thieves.

1142
01:29:35.916 --> 01:29:38.017
But I'm not a killer.

1143
01:29:39.586 --> 01:29:43.522
There he is...
And there and there.


1144
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:45.858
My guardian angel.

1145
01:29:45.926 --> 01:29:47.860
My unseen listener.

1146
01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:49.862
John cerruti.

1147
01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:52.031
Somewhere in the air,

1148
01:29:52.099 --> 01:29:55.268
Recording, peeking in.

1149
01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:59.104
John cerruti killed tim.

1150
01:29:59.172 --> 01:30:01.524
Cerruti.

1151
01:30:01.592 --> 01:30:04.027
Did it with my men
and my money.


1152
01:30:04.094 --> 01:30:06.529
And the profits
went into my companies.


1153
01:30:06.597 --> 01:30:10.700
When he told me he'd killed
my son, there was nothing
I could do against him,


1154
01:30:10.768 --> 01:30:13.302
'cause every finger
in the country
would point to me.


1155
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:15.371
Tim's own pa.

1156
01:30:15.439 --> 01:30:18.207
And you too.
And our family.


1157
01:30:18.275 --> 01:30:22.879
- No, pa.
- You think I'm in control here?


1158
01:30:22.947 --> 01:30:25.715
I'm nothing
but a goddamn front.


1159
01:30:25.783 --> 01:30:28.952
Cerruti has run everything
since the day tim was shot.


1160
01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:34.140
Darndest part-

1161
01:30:35.743 --> 01:30:38.110
Don't even
give himself a raise.


1162
01:30:38.178 --> 01:30:39.979
Lives in brooklyn
in a rabbit hole.


1163
01:30:48.305 --> 01:30:50.673
<i>Whatcha doing?
I'm calling the police.</i>


1164
01:30:50.741 --> 01:30:53.075
You begging to die?

1165
01:30:53.143 --> 01:30:55.411
You got eyes
in that empty head?


1166
01:30:55.479 --> 01:30:59.415
Look, I'm an old man-
skin sagging, false teeth,
eyes milking over.


1167
01:30:59.483 --> 01:31:02.485
But I've been
holding this thing together
with the minutes ticking by...


1168
01:31:02.553 --> 01:31:05.888
'cause when this old clock
comes undone, you watch
where the wheels will fly.


1169
01:31:05.955 --> 01:31:10.760
- I won't buy it, pa.
- I'm standing between you
and darkest night, son.


1170
01:31:10.827 --> 01:31:12.762
The other side of me
is chaos.


1171
01:31:14.515 --> 01:31:17.617
Hold it, keifitz.
We won't need the gun.


1172
01:31:17.685 --> 01:31:21.521
Won't need the gun?
God, son, it must've been
the milkman after all,


1173
01:31:21.588 --> 01:31:24.089
'cause you sure as hell
ain't no part of me.


1174
01:31:24.157 --> 01:31:26.409
That man damn well
needs his gun...


1175
01:31:28.478 --> 01:31:30.846
'cause he's gonna

1176
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:05.815
Pa!

01:32:05.883 --> 01:32:08.051
Pa, take my hand!

Stupid!
You wanna go with me?
Take my hand, pa!

You get out of this alive, son-

1180
01:32:17.294 --> 01:32:19.228
You get out of this alive.

1181
01:32:19.296 --> 01:32:23.449
Take our money
out of the western world
and put it in south america.


1182
01:32:23.484 --> 01:32:27.119

1184
01:32:52.929 --> 01:32:55.714
Pa's dead.

1185
01:32:55.782 --> 01:32:57.649
I'll connect you
with john cerruti.

01:33:01.605 --> 01:33:03.672
Yes, mr. Kegan.

1188
01:33:17.221 --> 01:33:19.788
Are you coming back?

1189
01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.792
I'm part of the family.

1190
01:33:39.643 --> 01:33:43.579
Hello. This is
yvette malone speaking.


1191
01:33:43.647 --> 01:33:45.581
I'm not home just now,

1192
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:49.252
But if you'll be kind enough
to leave your name

1193
01:33:49.319 --> 01:33:51.421
I'll call you when I return.

1194
01:33:51.488 --> 01:33:53.423
Please begin
at the tone.


1195
01:33:55.992 --> 01:33:58.528
Hello, honey.

This is nick.

1197
01:34:00.664 --> 01:34:03.332
I just wanted to hear
your voice once more.


1198
01:34:04.601 --> 01:34:07.770
And I wanted to tell you
that I love you...


1199
01:34:07.837 --> 01:34:10.105
And I'll miss you.
