10
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:00.727
I saw you serve a woman!
I saw you with my own eyes!


11
00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.429
- Uh, I really don't think...
- You were!


12
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.929

Parvana.

15
00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:13.673
It's the only thing
of value we have left.


16
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.610
I never wore it.
Not even once.


17
00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:20.045
Where would you wear it,
Parvana?


18
00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:23.750
- Let's continue your studies. All right?
- Yes, Baba.


19
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:28.889
Now, what can you tell me
about the Silk Road?


20
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.626
The Silk Road.

21
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.398
Baba, I can't remember
about the Silk Road.


22
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.998
Maybe if we think of it
like a story.


23
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.769
Stories remain in our hearts
even when all else is gone.


24
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.605
Our people have always told
stories, from our very beginning,


25
00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.844
when we were Parthia
and Khorasan.


26
00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:55.514
[Baba] <i>A fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,</i>


27
00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:59.718
<i>scorched by the fiery eyes
of the Northern Deserts,</i>


28
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.756
<i>black rubble earth
against ice peaks.</i>


29
00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:06.796
<i>Our land was the petrified
skeleton of a monster.</i>


30
00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:09.528
<i>We were</i> Ariana,

31
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.000
<i>the land of the noble
and honorable.</i>


32
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:16.203
<i>We were a pathway
to everywhere,</i>


33
00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.874
<i>carrying goods
from east to west.</i>


34
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.740
<i>We studied the stars</i>

35
00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:24.944
<i>and began to see order
amidst the chaos.</i>


36
00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:29.014
<i>We were scientists,
philosophers, and storytellers.</i>


37
00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:32.686
<i>Questions sought answers
and then more questions.</i>


38
00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:36.188
<i>We began to see our place
in the universe.</i>


39
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.893
<i>But we were at the edges of
empires at war with each other,</i>


40
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:42.728
<i>as borders were defined
and redefined...</i>


41
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.700
- [shouting, horses whinnying]
- <i>over thousands of years.</i>


42
00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:50.806
<i>Of these mighty rulers
came Cyrus the Great of Persia.</i>


43
00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:55.610
<i>Then Alexander the Great
of Macedon.</i>


44
00:03:56.244 --> 00:03:58.944
<i>There came the Mauryan Empire,</i>

45
00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.881
<i>Genghis Khan,</i>

46
00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:03.250
<i>and so on and so on.</i>

47
00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:05.818
<i>Each time
there was bloodshed,</i>


48
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.023
<i>and each time
there were survivors.</i>


49
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.626
<i>A pattern repeating itself
endlessly.</i>


50

[horse whinnies]

51
00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:16.962
<i>When I was young, Parvana,</i>

52
00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:20.967
<i>I knew what peace felt like,
here in this city.</i>


53
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:25.138
<i>Children went to school,
women went to university.</i>


54
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.941
<i>All the empires
forgot about us,</i>


55
00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:29.142
<i>for a while at least.</i>

56
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.744
[explosion]

57
00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:32.746
- <i>But it did not last.</i>
- [men shouting]


58
00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:35.614
<i>The ground became weak
under our feet,</i>


59
00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:37.950
<i>always uncertain.</i>

60
00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:41.186
<i>First came a coup d'Ã©tat,
then an invasion,</i>


61
00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.891
<i>then a civil war.</i>

62
00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:45.624
<i>In the chaos,</i>

63
00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:48.763
<i>some looked to those
who might restore order.</i>


64
00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:51.797
<i>But at a great cost.</i>

65
00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:55.167
[man shouting] We have determined
specific dignity for women!


66
00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.272
Women should not go outside and
attract unnecessary attention!


67
00:04:59.274 --> 00:05:03.809
If a woman shows herself, she will
be cursed by the Islamic Sharia


68
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:06.212
and should never expect
to go to heaven.


69
00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:08.782
Everything changes,
Parvana.


70
00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:10.887
Stories remind us of that.

71
00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:17.924
Parvana, were you
listening at all?


72
00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:19.191
Yes, Baba.

73
00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:23.063
Why don't you tell me
about our nomadic ancestors


74
00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:25.601
and their hills of gold?

75
00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:27.967
Well?

76
00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.738
2,000 years ago...

77
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.808
- Yes?
- 2,000 years ago...


78
00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:37.943
[Parvana]
<i>there was a Bactrian princess</i>


79
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:40.380
<i>who had a crown.</i>

80
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.349
[Baba]
<i>And?</i>


81
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.217
- [Parvana] <i>And...</i>
- <i>Parvana?</i>


82
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.686
Away.
Keep away from my things.


83
00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.955
Go away. I said go
away, you silly dog!


84
00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:52.892
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?


85
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.159
Why is this girl
shouting?


86
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.395
She is only a child.
She meant nothing by it.


87
00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:58.164
She's drawing attention
to herself!


88
00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:00.734
She should be at home, not
displaying herself in the market.


89
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:04.070
I have no son at home, except an infant.
I need my daughter to help me.


90
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.739
- Stand up when we talk to you.
- I am a cr...


91
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:07.043
I said stand up!

92
00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:11.180
[groans]

93
00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:15.914
- I know you.
- Yes, Idrees.


94
00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:18.150
I was your teacher once.
You were a good student.


95
00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:21.054
You wasted my time, teaching
me things of no worth.


96
00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:24.691
I have joined the Taliban and now
I fight the enemies of Islam.


97
00:06:24.693 --> 00:06:29.261
Well, if I am an enemy, then for
my sins God has taken my leg.


98
00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.131
Are you making fun of me,
old man?


99
00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:34.768
I lost my leg in the war.
The war we fought together.


100
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.936
- How old is the girl?
- Idrees.


101
00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.905
- She is a child.
- She's old enough to marry.


102
00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:40.739
I'll be looking
for a wife soon.


103
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:42.741
She's already been promised
to someone.


104
00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:44.443
Well, she should
cover herself properly.


105
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.845
- Maybe you should stop looking at her.
- What did you say to me?


106
00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:49.015
I said
stop looking at her.


107
00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:50.883
- I can have you killed!
- Idrees.


108
00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:53.085
- You watch what you say!
- That's enough. Come on.


109
00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:55.789
[exhales]

110
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.424
Are you all right?

111
00:06:57.426 --> 00:06:59.258
Yes, Baba.

112
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.796
That's my girl.

113
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.897
Let's go home now.

114
00:07:16.378 --> 00:07:18.378
[sighs]

115
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.016
Parvana?

116
00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:24.284
You told that boy
I was promised to someone.


117
00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:26.119
Am I getting married?

118
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.921
[chuckling] Of course not.
You are still a child.


119
00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:31.323
I want you playing
and telling stories.


120
00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:33.193
I'm too old for that now.

121
00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:36.296
Too old for stories?
You've always loved stories.


122
00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:38.234
What's the use?

123
00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:53.046
I'll have a word with Mama-jan
and we'll sort it all out.


124
00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:54.780
Please don't mention
the dress.


125
00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:59.020
[humming]

126
00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:02.955
Then I'll never
hear the end of it.


127
00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.291
- The end of what?
- Nothing, Mama-jan.


128
00:08:05.293 --> 00:08:07.926
[Baba] We're not selling
Parvana's good dress.


129
00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:10.429
Baba, that's not
what I meant.


130
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.498
We need the money,
Baba.


131
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.301
We'll hold off for a bit. I
think business will pick up.


132
00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:19.371
If business picks up, then we
won't have to sell it, sure.


133
00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:23.177
But the sky is far and the earth is hard.
We will have to sell it soon.


134
00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:25.244
Well, what about a little story
before dinner?


135
00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:28.847
And we'll forget all about
dresses for a while.


136
00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:31.417
Maybe Parvana would like
to read something for us?


137
00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:34.120
Not right now, Mama-jan.
I'm tired.


138
00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:36.990
[chuckles] She's not a child
anymore, she tells me.


139
00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:39.259
So she doesn't
like stories.


140
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.861
Don't be in such a hurry
to grow up, my sweet girl.


141
00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:45.231
It might not be
all that you expect.


142
00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.501
We're out of water. You didn't
bring enough this morning.


143
00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:50.435
But there's half a bucket
by the door.


144
00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:54.540
When I was young enough to fetch
water, the buckets were never empty.


145
00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:56.409
- Hey!
- [mother] Girls, stop it.


146
00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.478
- Either you go out and get more water after dinner...
- [humming]


147
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.981
or you can wash
Zaki's dirty diapers.


148
00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:04.516
- How are you feeling?
- Better.


149
00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:05.985
Now that you're here.

150
00:09:05.987 --> 00:09:11.124
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so
much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.


151
00:09:11.126 --> 00:09:14.059
- Parvana.
- [Baba] You should have some respect.


152
00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:16.862
Why don't you eat,
hmm?


153
00:09:16.864 --> 00:09:21.103
- Things always look better when your belly is full.
- Yes, Maudar.


154
00:09:26.874 --> 00:09:29.911
[babbling]

155
00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.447
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I
pull up your sleeves.


156
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.049
No, Mama-jan.

157
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:39.052
- There. There you go.
- [babbling continues]


158
00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:43.188
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana.
Leave them for Zaki.


159
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.525
Why don't you give him that big
raisin on your chin, Soraya?


160
00:09:46.527 --> 00:09:48.895
Oh, but it's
not a raisin.


161
00:09:48.897 --> 00:09:50.999
It's a big,
hairy mole.


162
00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:54.402
Parvana,
apologize to Soraya.


163
00:09:58.205 --> 00:09:59.841
Parvana?

164
00:10:03.578 --> 00:10:05.944
[knocking on door]

165
00:10:05.946 --> 00:10:08.213
[Idrees]
He's in there! I saw him!


166
00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:09.982
- [man shouting] If there are women present...
- Baba?


167
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.854
Cover yourselves now!

168
00:10:13.955 --> 00:10:16.188
That's the man.
An enemy of Islam.


169
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.458
He's got forbidden books, and he's
teaching the women with them!


170
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.361
- Leave us be!
- He's done nothing!


171
00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:26.265
- Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.
- [all shouting]


172
00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:27.634
Baba!

173
00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:30.203
- You can't take him!
- Baba!


174
00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:32.337
- [screams, groans]
- Baba-jan!


175
00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:34.439
[Zaki crying]

176
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:36.275
Where is he being taken?

177
00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:38.278
To prison.

178
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.183
They'll teach him a good lesson
in Pul-e-Charkhi.


179
00:10:42.249 --> 00:10:44.284
- [sobbing]
- Baba!


180
00:10:44.286 --> 00:10:45.952
Baba!

181
00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:47.587
[engine starts]

182
00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:49.391
[gasps]

183
00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:11.544
Mama-jan?
Can I light the lamp?


184
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.981
Hush, Parvana.
You'll wake Zaki.


185
00:11:14.983 --> 00:11:16.949
But if they
let Baba go,


186
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:19.718
he'll need a light in
the window to see home.


187
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.258
How could he come home? He doesn't
even have his stick to walk with.


188
00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:28.428
Go back to sleep.
It will be all right.


189
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.430
How do you know that, Mama-jan?
How do you know?


190
00:11:31.432 --> 00:11:35.104
Be quiet, Parvana. She has
enough to worry about.


191
00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.511
[laughing, babbling]

192
00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:48.448
Hey!
Zaki, stop it.


193
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.049
[squealing, laughing]

194
00:11:50.051 --> 00:11:52.050
Get up, Parvana.
Stop playing around.


195
00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:53.618
Why?
What's going on?


196
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.288
You and I
are going to find Baba.


197
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.192
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi
prison, so that's where we are going.


198
00:11:59.194 --> 00:12:01.093
But we can't go outside
without Baba.


199
00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.196
Soraya is writing a letter
for the prison governor


200
00:12:03.198 --> 00:12:05.564
to protest Nurullah's arrest
and ask for his release.


201
00:12:05.566 --> 00:12:08.534
- At least I can give them that.
- Mama-jan, it's not allowed.


202
00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:11.737
We might be all right if we don't
draw attention to ourselves.


203
00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:13.539
- But we can't...
- Come on, Parvana.


204
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.344
And bring Baba's walking stick.
We have to get going.


205
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.219
[groans]

206
00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:28.089
Mama.

207
00:12:48.442 --> 00:12:50.308
Hey.

208
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.247
Hey, you!

209
00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:57.416
Salaam. Can you tell me
the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?


210
00:12:57.418 --> 00:13:01.721
Salaam. Uh, it's east,
past the river.


211
00:13:01.723 --> 00:13:04.222
- But it's a long way.
- Thank you, sir.


212
00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:07.463
Listen. Go through the old
town, or you'll be caught.


213
00:13:22.109 --> 00:13:24.110
[truck stops]

214
00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:27.416
- [engine off]
- [door opens, closes]


215
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.250
- Why are you out here by yourself?
- [stammering]


216
00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:33.185
- Where is your husband?
- I have no choice.


217
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:36.121
It's not permitted to be out here
without your husband or your brother.


218
00:13:36.123 --> 00:13:38.156
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Do you understand?


219
00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:41.227
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest...
- Just go home.


220
00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:42.727
- No!
- What do you mean, "no"?


221
00:13:42.729 --> 00:13:44.462
This is Nurullah Alizai,
my husband.


222
00:13:44.464 --> 00:13:47.165
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him.
- Photographs are forbidden!


223
00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.602
- I have no one at home...
- What are you doing, showing me a photograph?


224
00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:54.107
- Out here by yourself. Go home!
- There is no one in my house except for children.


225
00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:58.513
You have no business out here. Do you
understand? Go home. Immediately.


226
00:13:59.747 --> 00:14:01.617
You're looking
for trouble now!


227
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:13.326
You are an insult to your
husband, to your race!


228
00:14:13.328 --> 00:14:15.461
I need to find out
what happened to him!


229
00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:19.134
- Shut up!
- [mother screaming, groaning]


230
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:24.073
[man grunting]

231
00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:36.515
Going to the prison
will change nothing.


232
00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:39.318
- [groans]
- If you make trouble like this,


233
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.188
your husband will be punished
severely for your insolence.


234
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.128
And if I find you out here again
by yourself, I will arrest you.


235
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:49.363
Now go.

236
00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.632
[truck door opens, closes]

00:14:55.536 --> 00:14:57.403
Mama-jan?

239
00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:59.374
[whispers]
Take me home.

[gasps]

243
00:16:05.806 --> 00:16:07.506
- More!
- Shh.


244
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.308
Go get water, Parvana.
We have none left.


245
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.681
- [Zaki fussing]
- Come on.


246
00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:44.278
[man]
Get out!


247
00:16:45.412 --> 00:16:47.615
What are you up to?

248
00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:50.618
Get out of here.
They'll see you!


249
00:16:51.518 --> 00:16:53.318
[man, faint]
Hey, stop!


250
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.690
Stop when I tell you!

251
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.598
Through here!

252
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.332
Stop!

253
00:17:06.334 --> 00:17:07.932
Where did
that boy go?


254
00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:09.637
Did you see?
Did you see?


255
00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:13.506
- Hey, you! Girl!
- Hey!


256
00:17:13.508 --> 00:17:15.643
- Come on!
- Forget about her!


257
00:17:20.347 --> 00:17:23.015
Parvana, this is
only half a bucket.


258
00:17:23.017 --> 00:17:24.883
Couldn't you fill them up
all the way?


259
00:17:24.885 --> 00:17:28.554
- [babbling, fussing]
- Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.


260
00:17:28.556 --> 00:17:31.856
- Hush, Zaki.
- Mama-jan!


261
00:17:31.858 --> 00:17:33.793
- Shh.
- Sooth him, Parvana.


262
00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:35.460
[whining]
Mama-jan.


263

- Tell him a story.
- [sighs]


264

Mama...

265
00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:41.367
One time
in the distant past,


266
00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:44.969
there was a little village at the
foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.


267
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:47.872
- I want Mama-jan.
- Shh. Listen.


268
00:17:47.874 --> 00:17:52.344
The villagers had just managed
to gather precious seeds.


269
00:17:52.346 --> 00:17:56.748
And so, there was dancing and
singing and laughing and eating.


270
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.950
Everyone was happy.

271
00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:00.952
<i>Especially for one boy</i>

272
00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:04.989

and ate more than anyone else.</i>

[chattering, laughing]

[singing in Afghan language]

275
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:24.776
<i>While the villagers were dancing and
singing and laughing and eating,</i>


276
00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:25.913
<i>monsters were coming.</i>

277
00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.918
- [thunderclap]
- [growling, roaring]


278
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.691
<i>The monsters frightened the
donkeys and ate the trees.</i>


279
00:18:40.862 --> 00:18:43.929
<i>They stole the most precious
thing in the whole village...</i>

[screaming, shouting]

281
00:18:45.565 --> 00:18:47.402
<i>the seeds
for next year's crop.</i>


282
00:18:50.872 --> 00:18:54.672
<i>Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush
mountains where their master lay...</i>


283
00:18:54.674 --> 00:18:58.544
<i>the dreadful Elephant King
with spikes for tusks.</i>

- <i>Grrrroar!</i>

- Grroar!

Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel
better when your belly is full.

[moans]

294

There's hardly
any food left.


295
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.682
I'll go
to the market.

[chattering,

Salaam. How much
for six apples, please?


301
00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.673
Salaam, child.
I can't serve you.


302
00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:38.009
But, sir, can I please
have six apples?


303
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:41.779
- Get your father to buy food for you.
- My father has been taken.


304
00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:43.984
I'm sorry.
Maybe come back later.

[chattering]

307
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.842
Literally stolen.
But you know...


308
00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:13.515
Salaam. Can I have
a kilo of rice, please?


309
00:21:15.082 --> 00:21:17.216
- Salaam.
- Hey, you!


310
00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:19.083
Girl!

311
00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:20.521
Hey, stop!

312
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:25.060
Stop when I tell you!

313
00:21:28.261 --> 00:21:30.764
[gasps, groans]

314
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.503
Go! Go home!

315
00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:39.838
[Parvana]
I dropped the bag.


316
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.606
- Hush.
- I lost the money.


317
00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:43.809
- Keep your head back.
- I can get the water though.


318
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:45.881
Don't worry
about that now.


319
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.913
I saved you
a piece of naan.


320
00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:52.553
I'll heat it up for you so it's
nice and fresh. All right?


321
00:22:13.807 --> 00:22:16.809
- [Parvana] What are we going to do?
- I don't know.


322
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:20.044
Maybe if I go out early,
before it's crowded.


323
00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:21.813
It won't work,
Parvana.


324
00:22:21.815 --> 00:22:25.351
Market sellers won't risk getting
in trouble for serving you.


325
00:22:25.353 --> 00:22:27.952
Mama-jan has cousins
in Mazar-e-Sharif.


326
00:22:27.954 --> 00:22:30.054
I could write to them
for help.


327
00:22:30.056 --> 00:22:34.627
But we've never even met them.
How do you know they will help?


328
00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:36.097
We need food now.

329
00:24:21.902 --> 00:24:23.835
These were
your brother's clothes.


330
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:27.041
They will be big,
but we can take them up a bit.


331
00:24:28.441 --> 00:24:31.275
Do I look like
a boy?


332
00:24:31.277 --> 00:24:34.012
You look like
Sulayman.


333
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:36.215
- So much like him.
- Mama-jan.


334
00:24:36.217 --> 00:24:38.816
He was such a good boy.

335
00:24:38.818 --> 00:24:42.086
Not much older
than you are now.


336
00:24:42.088 --> 00:24:43.190
Shh.

337
00:24:44.424 --> 00:24:46.425
It's all right,
Mama-jan.


338
00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:49.961
Parvana is going to the
market for food and water.


339
00:24:49.963 --> 00:24:52.966
It's the only way, Mama-Jan.
We have nothing left.


340
00:25:10.918 --> 00:25:13.284
[chattering
in Afghan language]


341
00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:16.522
But these juices are warm.
I don't want warm juice.


342
00:25:16.524 --> 00:25:19.194
[squawking, clucking]

343

[flies buzzing]

344
00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:46.118
- [laughing]
- Yes, that's what I said, but you know...


345
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.419
Salaam. Salaam!

346
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:50.221
Excuse me. Salaam!

347
00:25:50.223 --> 00:25:52.958
Salaam! Salaam!
Come inside, boy!


348
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.131
- I'm not going to deliver, am I?
- [both laughing]


349
00:25:58.298 --> 00:26:01.102
[shopkeeper] But you
know how it goes, right?


350
00:26:03.304 --> 00:26:05.370
Well, let's hear it.

351
00:26:05.372 --> 00:26:10.245
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of
lentils, and a small amount of raisins.


352
00:26:11.478 --> 00:26:13.111
A small amount?
[laughs]


353
00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:15.479
Should I go
by my imagination?


354
00:26:15.481 --> 00:26:17.181
- Yes.
- [man laughing]


355
00:26:17.183 --> 00:26:20.118
Not very bright, this one.
[laughs]


356
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.456
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.
[laughing]


357
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:27.025
Look at him smiling!
[laughs]


358
00:26:27.027 --> 00:26:30.528
Little guy doesn't even know
when he's being made fun of.


359
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.066
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.


360
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:56.220
You're spilling
the tea.


361
00:26:56.222 --> 00:26:57.892
Sorry, Uncle.

362
00:27:05.231 --> 00:27:07.466
Who are you? Why were
you staring at me?


363
00:27:07.468 --> 00:27:08.967
- What is your name?
- My name?


364
00:27:08.969 --> 00:27:11.335
- I know you from somewhere.
- No... I wasn't...


365
00:27:11.337 --> 00:27:14.438
- Wasn't what?
- [stammering] You don't know me.


366
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.240
- I do know you.
- No!


367
00:27:16.242 --> 00:27:19.011
- I <i>do</i> know you! You're Parvana!
- I'm not!


368
00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:21.416
I am Shauzia! Remember?
From school?


369
00:27:22.917 --> 00:27:26.118
- Shauzia?
- I had long hair then, but so did you.


370
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.320
- [man] Deliwar.
- Don't tell anyone.


371
00:27:28.322 --> 00:27:29.858
Here's your cap.

372
00:27:31.124 --> 00:27:32.925
You need to get
a boy's name


373
00:27:32.927 --> 00:27:35.494
so you don't hesitate
next time somebody asks you.


374
00:27:35.496 --> 00:27:37.361
I am Deliwar now.

375
00:27:37.363 --> 00:27:38.996
It means "brave."

376
00:27:38.998 --> 00:27:41.365
- [man] Where are you?
- I-I have to run.


377
00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:43.470
It was good to see you.

378
00:27:45.204 --> 00:27:47.008
Deliwar.

379
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:49.675
[Soraya]
Mama-jan, please sit down.


380
00:27:49.677 --> 00:27:54.246
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then?
- She's fine. I'm...


381
00:27:54.248 --> 00:27:55.580
Who's hungry?

382

[sighs]
Parvana.


383
00:27:58.152 --> 00:28:00.384
Praise Allah. He has
returned you to me.


384
00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:03.956
[chuckling] Mama-jan,
you're squashing the naan.


385
00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:06.027
It smells delicious,
Parvana.


386
00:28:11.297 --> 00:28:13.332
[Parvana chuckles]

387

Zaki.

388
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.375
It's me. See?

389
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.046
I bought them
especially for you.


390
00:28:29.048 --> 00:28:32.016
- [chuckles]
- Parvana?


391
00:28:32.018 --> 00:28:34.119
If you run out
and get some water,


392
00:28:34.121 --> 00:28:36.321
he'll get used to you
by the time you come back.


393
00:28:36.323 --> 00:28:38.489
- But I'm tired.
- Hurry on, Parvana.


394
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:40.191
It's almost curfew.

[shouting, chattering]

396
00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:10.291
You look
so much like him.


397
00:29:11.158 --> 00:29:12.690
Go change
Sulayman's clothes,


398
00:29:12.692 --> 00:29:14.493
or you'll
get them dirty.


399
00:29:14.495 --> 00:29:16.296
They are already
dirty.

- What?
- [babbling]


402
00:29:28.342 --> 00:29:31.642
He wants you to continue your
story about the elephant.


403
00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:33.644
[babbling]
Elephant.

Well, um...

00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:37.615
in the village,

406
00:29:37.617 --> 00:29:40.052
under the
Hindu Kush mountains,


407
00:29:40.054 --> 00:29:42.590
the poor villagers
cried bitter tears.

410
00:29:49.395 --> 00:29:52.163

to sow come next spring</i>

<i>and nothing to eat
come next winter.</i>

he did not cry bitter tears.</i>

and he shouted...</i>

a little bit afraid.</i>


418
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.757

been weeping bitter tears</i>

of seed back before spring.</i>

I will get the bag of

repeated his promise.</i>

I said, I will get the bag

Mama-jan,
now that I am a boy


434
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:23.220
we can go to the
prison and find Baba.


435
00:31:23.222 --> 00:31:25.756
No, Parvana,
we can't do that.


436
00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:27.258
- Why not?
- Shh.


437
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.727
It's not that simple,
Parvana.


438
00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:31.595
But we have to try.

439
00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:34.198
- There's nothing we can do.
- That's not true.


440
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.671
Stop it, Parvana.
You're upsetting her.

[Idrees] Hey! Hey! I told you to stop!
Why do you keep running?


442
00:31:49.716 --> 00:31:51.783
You should have stopped
when you were told to.


443
00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:55.387
Where's your burqa? Why are you
dressed like this outside your house?

[crying] My husband took my burqa.
I needed to buy medicine.

[whispering]
Stop it. Stop it.

He should be punished for
letting you outside like this!

Well? Have you remembered
your name yet?

I don't think
I can go on like this.

Too bad.
I could use some help.

00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:55.880
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all.
- But I'm not a boy.


458
00:32:55.882 --> 00:32:57.815
You're not a boy,
you're not a girl.


459
00:32:57.817 --> 00:33:01.620
I need a helper because this tray
is too heavy. Will you help?


460
00:33:01.622 --> 00:33:05.790
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go
of the tray, the strap will break.


461
00:33:05.792 --> 00:33:07.359
[sighs]
That's better.


462
00:33:07.361 --> 00:33:08.927
- Aatish.
- What?


463
00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:11.696
I remembered my name.
It's Aatish.


464
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:14.032
- That's not really a name.
- It means "fire."


465
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:17.768
I know what it means,
but it's still not a name.


466
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.871
Then it suits me fine.

467
00:33:19.873 --> 00:33:21.475
I'll call you
Aatish then.


468
00:33:22.608 --> 00:33:25.677
When you're a boy you can
go anywhere you like,


469
00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:27.480
Aatish Khan.

470
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.621
Where are we going?

471
00:33:37.623 --> 00:33:39.360
You'll see.

472
00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:56.940
What if someone
sees us?


473
00:33:56.942 --> 00:33:59.410
I usually just pretend
I work here.


474
00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:01.649
If you look like you believe
it, then they will too.


475
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:04.818
See? We're cleaners.

476
00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:39.050
What are you
waiting for?


477
00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:41.452
It's either ours,
or the mice eat it.


478
00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:43.854
I need to find a way
to see my Baba.


479
00:34:43.856 --> 00:34:46.657
You can have mine if you like.
I don't want him.


480
00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.494
My father was taken to prison and
we've heard nothing of him since.


481
00:34:50.496 --> 00:34:53.064
- They won't let you see him, Parvana.
- But I'm a boy now.


482
00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:56.800
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or
let him go, but there's nothing you can do.


483
00:34:56.802 --> 00:34:59.003
You don't know that.

484
00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:02.476
I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is.


485
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:09.747
There might be a way, but
you'll need lots of money.


486
00:35:09.749 --> 00:35:11.682
What for?

487
00:35:11.684 --> 00:35:14.889
You can get a lot done
with bribes. A lot.


488
00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:21.862
[Parvana] Anything written.
Anything read.


489
00:35:23.463 --> 00:35:25.463
Pashto and Dari.

490
00:35:25.465 --> 00:35:27.468
Wonderful items
for sale.


491
00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:30.968
Anything written!
Anything read!


492
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.470
Anything written!
Anything read!


493
00:35:33.472 --> 00:35:35.710
What happened to the man
who used to sit here?


494
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.077
It is a simple question.

495
00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:40.912
Don't you know?

496
00:35:40.914 --> 00:35:43.847
How should I know? Answer the question.
Where is he?


497
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:47.017
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif.
- And what are you to him?


498
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:51.525
I'm his nephew,
uh... Aatish.


499
00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.459
Do you know
how to read?


500
00:35:55.461 --> 00:35:59.499
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari.
- Read this.


501
00:36:02.735 --> 00:36:04.771
Let's see
if you're any good.


502
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.776
[sighs]

503
00:36:11.478 --> 00:36:13.847
Come on. Take it out
of the envelope.


504
00:36:16.182 --> 00:36:17.782
"Dear Razaq..."

505
00:36:17.784 --> 00:36:20.785
Louder, or I will have to
take my business elsewhere.


506
00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:24.189
"Dear Razaq, I hope this
letter reaches you in Kabul.


507
00:36:24.191 --> 00:36:27.191
I'm writing to you
with sad news.


508
00:36:27.193 --> 00:36:32.432
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum
died on the way to her sister's wedding.


509
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:37.101
The bus she was traveling on
hit a land mine.


510
00:36:37.103 --> 00:36:39.537
Her injuries
were too great to bear


511
00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:41.905
and she died
some hours afterward.


512
00:36:41.907 --> 00:36:44.541
I know this must be
a great shock to you,


513
00:36:44.543 --> 00:36:46.878
but please know that when
I last spoke to Hala,


514
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.583
she told me of your
kindness toward her.


515
00:36:51.083 --> 00:36:53.184
May Allah bless you now,

516
00:36:53.186 --> 00:36:55.823
guide your path,
and give you courage."


517
00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:00.927
I'm sorry.

518
00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:09.470
[sighs]

519
00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:36.561
[mother] Ah, there's
my sweet little girl


520
00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:38.262
underneath
all the dust of Kabul.


521
00:37:38.264 --> 00:37:39.997
[Zaki fussing]

522
00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:42.599
[Soraya] Parvana,
what did you give Zaki?


523
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:44.869
- It's a piece of candy.
- A piece?


524
00:37:44.871 --> 00:37:47.070
Oh!

525
00:37:47.072 --> 00:37:49.541
It's big enough
to choke him!


526
00:37:49.543 --> 00:37:52.276
Let him be, Soraya.
You're spoiling his fun.


527
00:37:52.278 --> 00:37:53.977
[fussing continues]

528
00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:55.280
Ow!

529
00:37:55.282 --> 00:37:58.182
[mother] Continue
the story, Parvana.


530
00:37:58.184 --> 00:38:00.318
- For Zaki.
- [Zaki exclaims]


531
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.753
[Parvana]
There was this young boy,


532
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:07.325
and he promised his people
to find the precious seeds.


533
00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:09.561
Elephant?
Elephant?


534
00:38:09.563 --> 00:38:12.664
Yes,
and the elephant.


535
00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:15.934
At night, the boy walked
through the pine trees


536
00:38:15.936 --> 00:38:18.972
on his way to the mountain
to face the Elephant King.


537
00:38:25.912 --> 00:38:28.780
<i>Something was following him
in the darkness,</i>


538
00:38:28.782 --> 00:38:31.785
<i>but he was too terrified
to turn around and face it.</i>


539
00:38:33.153 --> 00:38:34.785
<i>He began to run,</i>

540
00:38:34.787 --> 00:38:36.990
<i>and the thing
that chased him also ran.</i>


541
00:38:39.726 --> 00:38:42.930
<i>The boy ran faster
and so did his pursuer.</i>


542
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.762
<i>He ran into the night,</i>

543
00:38:45.764 --> 00:38:49.603
<i>chased by the unknown demons
until he could run no more.</i>


544
00:38:50.202 --> 00:38:52.070
<i>He tumbled down a hill.</i>

545
00:38:52.072 --> 00:38:54.008
- [screaming]
- <i>Down.</i>


546
00:38:55.141 --> 00:38:57.208
<i>Down.</i>

547
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.811
<i>Down.</i>

548
00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:05.118
[sighs]

549
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.262
[mother] <i>Dear Cousin, it has been
many years since we have spoken,</i>


550
00:39:18.264 --> 00:39:23.166
<i>but I am writing to you now to tell
you that my husband has been arrested</i>


551
00:39:23.168 --> 00:39:27.141
<i>and we have no word on when
he will be released, if at all.</i>


552
00:39:28.974 --> 00:39:32.746
<i>My family is in a desperate
situation and I need your help.</i>


553
00:39:33.713 --> 00:39:35.680
<i>My eldest daughter
is now of age,</i>


554
00:39:35.682 --> 00:39:40.621
<i>and I am asking that you consider her as
a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.</i>


555
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.789
<i>Please take us out of Kabul</i>

556
00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:47.992
<i>so that we may have
a chance of survival.</i>


557
00:39:47.994 --> 00:39:50.394
<i>We will not be
a burden to you.</i>


558
00:39:50.396 --> 00:39:52.296
<i>We are skilled and strong</i>

559
00:39:52.298 --> 00:39:55.066
<i>and need little
by the way of means.</i>


560
00:39:55.068 --> 00:39:59.006
<i>May the blessings of Allah
be upon you. Fattema.</i>


561
00:40:02.374 --> 00:40:05.376
Anything written!
Anything read!


562
00:40:05.378 --> 00:40:08.246
Anything written!
Anything read!


563
00:40:08.248 --> 00:40:09.680
Anything written!

564
00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:11.849
How much
for the dress?


565
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:13.284
Salaam. It's handmade.

566
00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:15.452
- How much?
- 3,000.


567
00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:18.122
Don't be stupid.
I'll give you 300.


568
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.756
2,000.

569
00:40:19.758 --> 00:40:21.693
Handmade
in Mazar-e-Sharif.


570
00:40:21.695 --> 00:40:25.699
Your daughter will be very happy
to wear such a beautiful dress.


571
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.802
She is my wife.

572
00:40:30.436 --> 00:40:32.169
1,500.

573
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:33.907
See how it sparkles?

574
00:40:35.275 --> 00:40:37.778
Here's 1,000.

575
00:40:46.086 --> 00:40:48.919
- How much did you make?
- A thousand.


576
00:40:48.921 --> 00:40:51.488
That might be enough
for a good bribe.


577
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.724
- Really?
- Definitely.


578
00:40:53.726 --> 00:40:57.461
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I
can hide from my father, I keep.


579
00:40:57.463 --> 00:41:00.668
And it's mounting up
to a nice little sum.


580
00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:03.066
See?

581
00:41:03.068 --> 00:41:05.836
I'm not going to stay
here forever, you know.


582
00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:08.805
- Have you ever been to the sea?
- No.


583
00:41:08.807 --> 00:41:10.006
Neither have I.

584
00:41:10.008 --> 00:41:14.412
But I've heard that the moon
pulls the water onto the shore


585
00:41:14.414 --> 00:41:16.347
and then
back out again.


586
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:17.914
I want to see that.

587
00:41:17.916 --> 00:41:22.887
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and
have them cooled by the lapping water.


588
00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:27.224
What about your father?
Doesn't he depend on you?


589
00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:28.828
I am a good son.

590
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:31.832
But he is not
a good father.


591
00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:36.334
- What will you do by the sea?
- [chuckles]


592
00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:41.372
I'd buy things and sell things,
like I do here, but for myself.


593
00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:45.476
There are people who go to the
edge of the water to do nothing.


594
00:41:45.478 --> 00:41:48.880
They just sit there and they look
at the sea with their sunglasses on


595
00:41:48.882 --> 00:41:50.981
or swim about
on floating tubes.


596
00:41:50.983 --> 00:41:53.950
So I could sell them
those things.


597
00:41:53.952 --> 00:41:56.954
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

598
00:41:56.956 --> 00:41:59.122
And maybe
I'll join you.


599
00:41:59.124 --> 00:42:01.295
- Where are you going?
- Wish me luck.


600
00:42:08.902 --> 00:42:12.470
- Why are you back so early?
- I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.


601
00:42:12.472 --> 00:42:14.271
What are you doing,
Parvana?


602
00:42:14.273 --> 00:42:15.872
I'm going to find Baba.

603
00:42:15.874 --> 00:42:17.541
- No, you're not.
- I'm going.


604
00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:19.577
You won't make it home
before curfew.


605
00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:21.945
I'm going. There's nothing
you can do to stop me.


606
00:42:21.947 --> 00:42:25.383
Mama-jan has been through enough
without you doing something so stupid.


607
00:42:25.385 --> 00:42:27.485
- I have to find him.
- Parvana!


608

Excuse me.

612
00:43:36.556 --> 00:43:39.055
Salaam. Hello!

613
00:43:39.057 --> 00:43:41.025
- [banging on door]
- Excuse me!


614
00:43:41.027 --> 00:43:43.360
- What do you want?
- [gasps]


615
00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:46.162
- I said, what do you want?
- I want to see my father.


616
00:43:46.164 --> 00:43:49.099
- Who?
- My father, Nurullah Alizai.


617
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:51.035
Brought here two weeks ago
without charge.


618
00:43:51.037 --> 00:43:53.970
- Get out of here.
- I have money... 1,000 afghani.


619
00:43:53.972 --> 00:43:56.974
- I can give it to you if you promise to help.
- Hey, what are you doing?


620
00:43:56.976 --> 00:43:59.610
Nothing.
Just getting rid of a kid.


621
00:43:59.612 --> 00:44:01.679
Please! Open up!

622
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:04.514
I have to see my father!
I have to see him!

[screams, groans]

624
00:44:07.019 --> 00:44:09.889
Now get out of here
unless you want some more.

They say it doesn't always
rain the way it thunders.


630
00:44:56.034 --> 00:45:00.637
Last we heard of him,
the boy had fallen down.


631
00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:06.043
He had fallen down the hill
and into the deepest of sleeps.


632
00:45:06.045 --> 00:45:09.347
But all was not lost.

633
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:13.450
He was discovered
by an old woman.


634
00:45:13.452 --> 00:45:15.054
She had a drum.

635

[Fattema] <i>A magic drum
that beat so beautifully</i>

What is it you seek?

641
00:45:41.046 --> 00:45:44.615
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant
King sent his jaguars to steal the...


642
00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:47.084
[cackling]

643
00:45:47.086 --> 00:45:50.488
No one has ever overcome
the Elephant King.


644
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.094
- I know.
- Well, what makes you think you can?


645
00:45:54.626 --> 00:45:56.093
I need to.

646
00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:57.695
I just need to,
that's all.


647
00:45:57.697 --> 00:46:00.597
That's not
a very good answer.


648
00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:05.171
[Fattema] <i>Nevertheless, the woman told
him he'd need to find three things...</i>

<i>something that ensnares,</i>

651
00:46:11.778 --> 00:46:14.110
<i>and something that soothes.</i>

652
00:46:14.112 --> 00:46:18.215
<i>Only then would he overcome
the Elephant King.</i>


653
00:46:18.217 --> 00:46:20.117
Give them to me,
please!


654
00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:22.119
[chuckles]
I don't have them,


655
00:46:22.121 --> 00:46:24.088
so you'd better
go look for them.


656
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:29.660
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted
soon, there will be no harvest.


657
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:31.162
Yes, I know.

658
00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:33.530
[Fattema]
<i>She told him to head east.</i>


659
00:46:33.532 --> 00:46:36.469
East is the other way.

00:46:37.603 --> 00:46:40.805
[Fattema] <i>Still something
followed the boy,</i>


661
00:46:40.807 --> 00:46:44.211
<i>and still
he could not face it.</i>


662
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:07.231
- He didn't take the money?
- I don't think bribes work on them.


663
00:47:07.233 --> 00:47:10.834
[sighs] No, no.
It probably wasn't enough.


664
00:47:10.836 --> 00:47:12.769
It might have
insulted him.


665
00:47:12.771 --> 00:47:16.307
You'll just have to save up more
and be even smarter next time.


666
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:19.742
- Aaah!
- <i>I</i> have to be smarter?


667
00:47:19.744 --> 00:47:23.447
I've heard there is a guy who
pays well for small jobs.


668
00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:25.448
Come on.

669
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.751
[Shauzia]
Sir, we have come to work.


670
00:47:27.753 --> 00:47:30.887
- And you are?
- I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.


671
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.689
We are brothers.

672
00:47:32.691 --> 00:47:35.126
What kind of a name
is Aatish?


673
00:47:35.128 --> 00:47:36.760
[Shauzia] I don't know.
Ask our father.


674
00:47:36.762 --> 00:47:40.467
- Where is your father?
- He was martyred by the Russians.


675
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:43.267
We can do
any job you want.


676
00:47:43.269 --> 00:47:44.638
For the right price.

677
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:48.541
[grunts]

678
00:47:56.882 --> 00:47:59.182
[exhales] That's the
last one, I think.


679
00:47:59.184 --> 00:48:00.885
Where are we anyway?

680
00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:03.854
About time. You boys
are not very strong.


681
00:48:03.856 --> 00:48:05.789
It was more work
than you said.


682
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:07.858
Here you are.
Now be off.


683
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.394
Hey, we did all
that you asked.


684
00:48:10.396 --> 00:48:13.229
Wait! You said
you'd drive us back.


685
00:48:13.231 --> 00:48:15.365
I'm not a taxi.
Make your own way home.


686
00:48:15.367 --> 00:48:18.869
I'm late already because you
took so long to load the truck.


687
00:48:18.871 --> 00:48:20.639
Wait!

688
00:48:38.324 --> 00:48:40.390
I need to rest
a moment.


689
00:48:40.392 --> 00:48:43.396
Stay on the path.
This place might be mined.


690
00:49:05.617 --> 00:49:08.619
This is not nearly enough.
We need better jobs.


691
00:49:08.621 --> 00:49:11.722
- Like what?
- I heard brick making pays well.


692
00:49:11.724 --> 00:49:13.660
But it's hard work.

693
00:49:15.394 --> 00:49:17.561
I wish I was stronger.

694
00:49:17.563 --> 00:49:19.762
But you have an older
brother, don't you?


695
00:49:19.764 --> 00:49:22.333
He used to bring you to
school on his shoulders.


696
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:25.235
What's his name?

697
00:49:25.237 --> 00:49:26.672
Sulayman.

698
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.242
He died.

699
00:49:31.244 --> 00:49:33.744
How?
Was it the sickness?


700
00:49:33.746 --> 00:49:36.412
- I don't know.
- But your mother must have told you.


701
00:49:36.414 --> 00:49:38.585
She doesn't speak of it.
All right?


702
00:49:40.952 --> 00:49:42.588
All right.

703
00:49:45.757 --> 00:49:48.726
Hey, look
what I've got.


704
00:49:48.728 --> 00:49:52.729
I found it in a little box where
my father keeps his things.


705
00:49:52.731 --> 00:49:55.965
Can you believe
the water is that blue?


706
00:49:55.967 --> 00:49:57.770
It's very nice.

707
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:08.611
[Parvana] Anything written!
Anything read!


708

Anything written!
Anything read!


710
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:17.521
I didn't pay you
last time.


711
00:50:17.523 --> 00:50:20.356
- How much do I owe you?
- It's okay. I...


712
00:50:20.358 --> 00:50:22.595
What, you don't charge
for bad news?


713
00:50:25.764 --> 00:50:27.731
[groans]

714
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:30.334
Who taught you to read?
The crippled teacher?


715
00:50:30.336 --> 00:50:32.068
Yes. My uncle.

716
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.537
Can you write
as good as you read?


717
00:50:34.539 --> 00:50:35.808
I can.

718
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.378
Here.

719
00:50:41.947 --> 00:50:44.517
I kept this
in case you wanted it.


720
00:50:45.617 --> 00:50:48.052
Show me. Show me
where it says her name.


721
00:50:48.054 --> 00:50:50.523
Where it says
"Hala."


722
00:50:52.624 --> 00:50:54.427
There. See?

723
00:50:55.094 --> 00:50:56.729
Hala.

724
00:51:14.512 --> 00:51:16.880
Do you know
what it means?

No.

726
00:51:19.784 --> 00:51:23.686
Sometimes, on a clear night
when you look at the moon,


727
00:51:23.688 --> 00:51:26.358
you can see a bright
outline around it.


728
00:51:27.592 --> 00:51:30.994
That outline
is called hala.


729
00:51:30.996 --> 00:51:34.434
My wife was named
for that light.


730
00:51:43.608 --> 00:51:45.409
- Here.
- This is too much.


731
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:47.644
Don't argue with me.

[Soraya] Keep him quiet.
I'm trying to sleep.


737
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:12.903
- What's the matter with you?
- Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?


738
00:52:12.905 --> 00:52:14.604
We'd all like that.

739
00:52:14.606 --> 00:52:17.974
Well, Zaki, do you want to know
what happened to the boy?

[babbling]

Yes, yes,
and the elephant.

[Zaki squeals]

743
00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:27.818
The boy ran and ran, his
heart beating fast in fear.

the milking instead.</i>

00:53:31.983 --> 00:53:36.186
See how it shines!

762
00:53:36.188 --> 00:53:38.689
<i>The boy was delighted
with the mirror,</i>


763
00:53:38.691 --> 00:53:43.797
<i>but as he looked into it, he saw the
reflection of the thing that followed him!</i>


764
00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:49.765
What are you doing,
Mama-jan?


765
00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:52.568
I'm laying out
Soraya's good clothes.


766
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.905
Am I to sell them
at the market?


767
00:53:54.907 --> 00:53:57.911
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana.
It's time to sleep.


768
00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.686
[Shauzia] I just need to find
a way to get to Peshawar,


769
00:54:09.688 --> 00:54:11.822
and I can figure it out
from there.


770
00:54:11.824 --> 00:54:14.224
I think there's
a beach in Goa


771
00:54:14.226 --> 00:54:16.593
where the tourists
are very rich.


772
00:54:16.595 --> 00:54:18.794
If they're rich, they
would buy my blue stones,


773
00:54:18.796 --> 00:54:22.131
and that's where I'd set up my
business, and you could join me.


774
00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:24.267
Once I find Baba.

775
00:54:24.269 --> 00:54:26.605
Once you find your Baba.

776
00:54:27.673 --> 00:54:30.008
[aircraft approaching]

777
00:54:45.858 --> 00:54:47.157
100.

778
00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:48.659
I'll give you 85.

779
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.892
- Ninety.
- Eighty-two.


780
00:54:49.894 --> 00:54:51.894
Eighty-five,
and that's final.


781
00:54:51.896 --> 00:54:54.534
Eighty-five and a bunch of
grapes, and that's final.


782
00:54:59.304 --> 00:55:03.773
You're leaning too hard on the
pen, but your writing is good.


783
00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:06.545
If you try it more gently,
it'll be easier.


784
00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.720
[chirping]

785
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:25.097
[people chattering]

786
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:45.718
Wait!
Wait a moment!


787
00:55:47.353 --> 00:55:49.218
What is it, child?

788
00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.923
You asked me before about the man who
used to sit there... the teacher.


789
00:55:52.925 --> 00:55:56.059
- Your uncle?
- He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.


790
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:59.229
He was taken to prison.
But he did nothing wrong.


791
00:55:59.231 --> 00:56:00.796
- Which one?
- What?


792
00:56:00.798 --> 00:56:03.099
- Which prison?
- Pul-e-Charkhi.


793
00:56:03.101 --> 00:56:06.638
It's been weeks now, and my
family has had no word of him.


794
00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:10.673
Go to the prison
on Wednesday.


795
00:56:10.675 --> 00:56:12.342
Ask for Roshan.
He's my cousin.


796
00:56:12.344 --> 00:56:15.914
Tell him Razaq sent you and
he will help you, if he can.


797
00:56:38.871 --> 00:56:41.673
[sighs]

798
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.740
Deliwar!

799
00:56:43.742 --> 00:56:49.246
With work like this, I'll be an old
woman by the time I get to the sea.


800
00:56:49.248 --> 00:56:52.081
Or an old man.

801
00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:53.952
[groans]

802
00:56:57.289 --> 00:57:01.390
You sit and rest, Deliwar,
and I'll tell you a story.


803
00:57:01.392 --> 00:57:04.664
- A story?
- Yes, a story.


804
00:57:05.764 --> 00:57:07.329
One time
in the deep past,


805
00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:11.901
there was a boy who had to return a stolen
bag of precious seeds to his village.


806
00:57:11.903 --> 00:57:15.338
Is it a happy story
or a sad story?


807
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.644
Just wait and see.

808
00:57:18.976 --> 00:57:22.012
The boy had been told
he needed three things


809
00:57:22.014 --> 00:57:25.182
in order to overcome
the Elephant King...


810
00:57:25.184 --> 00:57:29.052
something that shines, something
that ensnares and something that...


811
00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:31.923
[man]
Hey, you two! Come here!


812
00:57:33.291 --> 00:57:35.124
Come on!

813
00:57:35.126 --> 00:57:36.726
I know that boy.

814
00:57:36.728 --> 00:57:39.262
Hurry up. Come here.

815
00:57:39.264 --> 00:57:40.896
Come on.

816
00:57:40.898 --> 00:57:43.702
We'd better do
what we're told.


817
00:57:46.804 --> 00:57:48.840
Get a move on,
lazy kids.


818
00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:56.182
[laughing]

819
00:57:57.048 --> 00:57:59.081
So these are
the new workers?


820
00:57:59.083 --> 00:58:01.952
- [men laughing]
- Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?


821
00:58:01.954 --> 00:58:05.155
Idrees suggested we have a
little arm-wrestling match.


822
00:58:05.157 --> 00:58:06.155
[laughing continues]

823
00:58:06.157 --> 00:58:09.258
To see if you're strong
enough to work for me.


824
00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.894
I saw you sitting down
over there instead of working.


825
00:58:11.896 --> 00:58:13.896
- [gasps]
- Idrees, stop now.


826
00:58:13.898 --> 00:58:15.865
Make me some tea.
[laughing]


827
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:18.170
[grunting, gasps]

828
00:58:19.838 --> 00:58:22.773
Let me see how feeble
<i>you</i> are, little one.


829
00:58:22.775 --> 00:58:24.039
[grunting]

830
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:26.311
He can't even
lift his hand.


831
00:58:27.945 --> 00:58:30.248
Get up and make us tea.

832
00:58:31.516 --> 00:58:34.985
Uncle, I think
you need new workers.


833
00:58:34.987 --> 00:58:37.854
- These ones are no good.
- Enough, Idrees.


834
00:58:37.856 --> 00:58:39.488
Leave the poor kids alone.

835
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.994
They are
a little undercooked.


836
00:58:45.831 --> 00:58:48.130
I know you.

837
00:58:48.132 --> 00:58:50.335
- You're the teacher's daugh...
- [grunts]


838
00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:54.005
[men laughing]

839
00:58:55.807 --> 00:58:57.941
- [angry shout]
- Idrees.


840
00:58:57.943 --> 00:58:59.943
Bring the gun back!

841
00:58:59.945 --> 00:59:01.977
I said
bring the gun back!


842
00:59:01.979 --> 00:59:04.883
- [angry shout]
- Idrees!


843
00:59:23.302 --> 00:59:25.101
Come out now!

844
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:27.340
[grunting]

845
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.472
Come out now!

846
00:59:30.474 --> 00:59:33.779
[kiln owner] Idrees, it has begun!
We are moving west.


847
00:59:34.847 --> 00:59:37.613
We have been given orders
to go immediately!


848
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:39.849
I know who you are!

849
00:59:39.851 --> 00:59:41.353
Do you hear?

850
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:44.554
Get up here! Come on!

851
00:59:44.556 --> 00:59:46.289
[gasping, panting]

852
00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:48.928
[kiln owner] Right now!
You little coward!


853
00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:54.934
You want to fight? Now
is your chance to fight!


854
00:59:56.902 --> 00:59:58.304
You become a man.

855
01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:19.391
[wind whistling]

856
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.559
[Shauzia] He's gone.

857
01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:25.628
[Parvana]
What if he comes back?


858
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.930
[Shauzia chuckles]
He'd be lucky.


859
01:00:27.932 --> 01:00:29.499
Where are we?

860
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.901
I came here once
when I ran away.


861
01:00:31.903 --> 01:00:35.974
I think the way in has gotten
smaller or I have gotten bigger.


862
01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.443
It looks old.

863
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.010
I lost a shoe.

864
01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:44.514
I lost my cap, although
I think it's outside.


865
01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.351
Why did you hit him?

866
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.423
When they took my father,
he was one of them.


867
01:00:53.557 --> 01:00:55.291
Tell me more
about the boy.


868
01:00:55.293 --> 01:00:56.992
What boy?

869
01:00:56.994 --> 01:00:58.961
The story boy.

870
01:00:58.963 --> 01:01:01.697
The boy was cold.

871
01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:05.302
<i>Though the sun burned in
the sky, it gave no heat.</i>


872
01:01:05.304 --> 01:01:08.305
[Shauzia] <i>But he had a
warm hat and a big coat.</i>


873
01:01:08.307 --> 01:01:10.039
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

874
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.508
<i>He had already found
one of the three things...</i>


875
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.410
<i>a mirror that shone.</i>

876
01:01:14.412 --> 01:01:18.048
<i>But when he looked at it,
he saw something behind him.</i>


877
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.717
<i>Something scary.
Something dreadful!</i>


878
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.686
- <i>A horse!</i>
- <i>No, Shauzia, not a horse.</i>


879
01:01:23.688 --> 01:01:25.588
- [chuckling]
- <i>Yes, it was.</i>


880
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.191
<i>And it was a very old horse whose bones
clattered together when it walked.</i>


881
01:01:29.193 --> 01:01:32.429
- <i>It wasn't scary at all.</i>
- [sighs]


882
01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:36.733
<i>Fine. The boy felt sad for the
old horse and fed him hay.</i>


883
01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.702
<i>And they all lived
happily ever after.</i>


884
01:01:38.704 --> 01:01:41.438
<i>It's the middle of the
story, not the end!</i>


885
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.206
<i>From a door carved
into the stone,</i>


886
01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:46.508
- <i>out came a round man.</i>
- [grunts]


887
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.579
You wasted my hay on an old
horse that will soon be dead!


888
01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:53.682
<i>The round man threw the boy deep
into the belly of an ancient well.</i>


889
01:01:53.684 --> 01:01:56.288
Aaah!

890
01:01:57.556 --> 01:02:00.189
<i>At the bottom of the well
there were emeralds,</i>


891
01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:04.260
<i>and the round man wanted them brought up
to him as payment for the wasted hay.</i>


892
01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.628
You will bring
the emeralds to me.


893
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.664
- <i>What's his name?</i>
- <i>The round man?</i>


894
01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:10.432
No, the boy.

895
01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:13.669
You can't have a story about a
boy and not give him a name.


896
01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:15.604
Give him a name
before I do.


897
01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:17.474
Sulayman.

898
01:02:17.476 --> 01:02:19.979
His name is Sulayman.

899
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.445
That's a good name.

900
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.414
Sulayman lay
at the bottom of the well.


901
01:02:25.416 --> 01:02:28.517
- <i>Suddenly, he could see skeletons.</i>
- [growling]


902
01:02:28.519 --> 01:02:33.356
<i>Three skeletons, each with an
emerald clutched in its bony hands.</i>


903
01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:35.191
- <i>He called out for help.</i>
- Help!


904
01:02:35.193 --> 01:02:38.327
<i>The poor old horse looked
back at him from way above.</i>


905
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:41.231
<i>But the horse did
something extraordinary.</i>


906
01:02:41.233 --> 01:02:44.166
<i>He neighed with the voice
of all the world's animals.</i>


907
01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:48.340
[neighing ferociously]

908
01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:57.113
<i>Sulayman climbed up, up,
all the way to the top,</i>


909
01:02:57.115 --> 01:02:59.481
<i>and he thanked the horse
for saving his life.</i>


910
01:02:59.483 --> 01:03:02.320
- Thank you for saving my life.
- [murmuring]


911
01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:09.659
<i>Sulayman had just
three emeralds with him...</i>


912
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.662
- [laughing]
- <i>And asked the round man for food in return.</i>


913
01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:14.396
<i>He was hungry.</i>

914
01:03:14.398 --> 01:03:16.666
<i>But the round man
was wicked and cheap.</i>


915
01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:20.537
<i>He threw a fishing net at Sulayman
and he told him to get his own food.</i>


916
01:03:20.539 --> 01:03:23.807
- <i>That was exactly what Sulayman needed.</i>
- Ha-ha!


917
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:26.209
<i>Something that ensnares.</i>

918
01:03:26.211 --> 01:03:27.811
<i>But as Sulayman left,</i>

919
01:03:27.813 --> 01:03:31.548
<i>the ghosts of the three skeletons
came out of the three emeralds</i>


920
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:34.517
<i>and swirled and twirled
and scared the round man</i>


921
01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:37.820
<i>in frightful vengeance for
having lost them their lives.</i>


922
01:03:37.822 --> 01:03:40.191
[screaming]

923
01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:45.727
<i>Sulayman and the horse continued
their journey toward the mountain,</i>


924
01:03:45.729 --> 01:03:49.231
<i>but the horse was getting
slower and slower.</i>


925
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:52.601
<i>He needed to rest,
being very, very old,</i>


926
01:03:52.603 --> 01:03:55.505
<i>and so Sulayman made a
shelter for the horse</i>


927
01:03:55.507 --> 01:03:58.208
<i>and told him
to wait for him.</i>


928
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.577
- <i>The horse protested...</i>
- [whinnies]


929
01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:04.514
<i>but Sulayman knew he had to face
the Elephant King and the jaguars</i>


930
01:04:04.516 --> 01:04:06.148
<i>all by himself.</i>

931
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.186
I will see you again,
old horse.


932
01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:12.458
<i>And so on he went alone.</i>

933
01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:27.202
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

934
01:04:27.204 --> 01:04:30.208
I'm going back there,
to the prison.


935
01:04:31.809 --> 01:04:34.145
They'll have to
let me see him then.


936
01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.367
From now on,
you're staying inside.


937
01:04:57.369 --> 01:04:59.635
- It's much too dangerous.
- No, Mama-jan.


938
01:04:59.637 --> 01:05:01.838
- We manage all right out there.
- "We"?


939
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.775
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too.
We work together.


940
01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:09.512
We've written to my cousin to arrange
a marriage for your sister in Mazar.


941
01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:11.648
They wrote back,
and it was accepted.


942
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:14.517
Someone will come for us the day
after tomorrow to take us away.


943
01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:16.418
- You don't need to do this anymore.
- What?


944
01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.421
We can't go on
like this.


945
01:05:18.423 --> 01:05:20.923
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive.
- Why?


946
01:05:20.925 --> 01:05:22.791
I provide for you
just fine.


947
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:24.961
It's not the job of a child.

948
01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.497
How can we leave
without Baba?


949
01:05:27.499 --> 01:05:29.965
Every day you come home
with cuts and blisters.


950
01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.671
Every day you go out there, and I don't
know if I'll see you back again.


951
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.805
I can't lose you too.

952
01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:38.807
I'm not going.

953
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:41.878
Baba could come back, and no one
will be here waiting for him.


954
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.314
So how long
should we wait?


955
01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:46.749
Until you're found out
and taken away from me?


956
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:48.985
Until I have to send Zaki out
to earn our keep?


957
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.287
Let me go see him
before we leave.


958
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:53.488
Let me tell him
where we are going.


959
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.892
- Parvana!
- Let me bring him his walking stick.


960
01:05:55.894 --> 01:05:57.626
Then I will go with you.

961
01:05:57.628 --> 01:06:01.564
Then I will be a good sister
and a good daughter.


962
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:03.169
I promise.

963
01:06:03.969 --> 01:06:05.570
I promise.

964
01:06:08.373 --> 01:06:11.177
[jets passing overhead]

965
01:06:20.652 --> 01:06:22.318
Please don't go.

966
01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.887
Please, it is much
too dangerous now.


967
01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:27.456
Mama-jan, I'm going.

968
01:06:27.458 --> 01:06:29.325
I'll be back tonight
before curfew.


969
01:06:29.327 --> 01:06:31.860
- No, Sulayman.
- Mama-jan.


970
01:06:31.862 --> 01:06:35.331
- You won't come back.
- Let her go now.


971
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:37.469
Let Parvana go.

972
01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:43.575
[babbles]

973
01:06:44.675 --> 01:06:46.612
Oh! [babbles]

974
01:06:53.517 --> 01:06:55.621
Parvana.

975
01:07:28.987 --> 01:07:30.655
[gasps]

976
01:07:31.655 --> 01:07:33.291
Deliwar!

977
01:07:34.726 --> 01:07:37.660
[laughs] You frightened
me half to death.


978
01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.662
I've been looking
for you everywhere.


979
01:07:39.664 --> 01:07:42.597
Why? You want to work at the
chai shop with me this morning?


980
01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:46.501
- No, I can't.
- Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?


981
01:07:46.503 --> 01:07:49.340
We are leaving Kabul
tomorrow.


982
01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:52.809
You are leaving me?

983
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:55.945
It's been arranged.
There's nothing I can do.


984
01:07:55.947 --> 01:08:00.083
My sister is getting
married in Mazar-e-Sharif.


985
01:08:00.085 --> 01:08:01.684
I'm going back
to the prison.


986
01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:03.686
I found someone
who can help me,


987
01:08:03.688 --> 01:08:05.921
and I need to get more money
to bribe the guard.


988
01:08:05.923 --> 01:08:07.823
I'll need it today.

989
01:08:07.825 --> 01:08:10.992
You'll just get another punch in the guts.
It's a stupid idea.


990
01:08:10.994 --> 01:08:12.829
I won't let that happen
this time.


991
01:08:12.831 --> 01:08:15.965
- I said it's a stupid idea.
- Please help me.


992
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.834
What do you want me to do?

993
01:08:17.836 --> 01:08:21.103
Magic some money into your hand
like in your kids' stories?


994
01:08:21.105 --> 01:08:23.805
It doesn't work like that,
Parvana.


995
01:08:23.807 --> 01:08:25.775
I can't help you.

996
01:08:25.777 --> 01:08:29.879
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif
and have a nice wedding party.


997
01:08:29.881 --> 01:08:33.982
Maybe they'll find a husband for you
too and your troubles will be over.


998
01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:36.419
Until after the wedding,
at least.


999
01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:37.856
You fool!

1000
01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.661
Deliwar!

1001
01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.364
Shauzia.

1002
01:08:53.872 --> 01:08:56.004
Shauzia.

1003
01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.939
Come with us.

1004
01:08:57.941 --> 01:09:00.476
I can't.

1005
01:09:00.478 --> 01:09:03.614
My father would come all the
way to Mazar to kill me.


1006
01:09:05.483 --> 01:09:08.487
I can't leave Kabul,
Parvana, not like this.


1007
01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:13.423
- Here, take this.
- I can't take your money.


1008
01:09:13.425 --> 01:09:15.394
Please take it.

1009
01:09:18.496 --> 01:09:20.897
Go and see your Baba.

1010
01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:24.967
Tell him that his daughter
is a good daughter.


1011
01:09:24.969 --> 01:09:28.640
Tell him
that Deliwar said so.


1012
01:09:34.913 --> 01:09:37.647
Hey, Deliwar.

1013
01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.781
What?

1014
01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:42.518
I'll meet you at that beach
you were talking about,


1015
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.187
where the moon
pulls the water,


1016
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:47.089
20 years from today.

1017
01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:50.226
[chuckles] I don't think I'll
recognize you then, Aatish.


1018
01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:54.432
Well, you can sell me some pretty
blue stones for a great price.


1019
01:09:56.467 --> 01:09:58.537
Until next time then.

1020
01:10:01.538 --> 01:10:03.805
Until next time.

1021
01:10:03.807 --> 01:10:06.545
[jets approaching]

1022
01:10:12.816 --> 01:10:14.819
[knocking]

1023
01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:24.093
Peace be upon you.
Are you Fattema?


1024
01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.294
Yes, I am Fattema.

1025
01:10:25.296 --> 01:10:28.563
I am your second cousin. Mohammed
Abdul sent me from Mazar.


1026
01:10:28.565 --> 01:10:30.933
Gather your family.
We must leave immediately.


1027
01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:34.704
No, you see, you weren't
supposed to come so soon.


1028
01:10:34.706 --> 01:10:37.240
My son is away. We must
wait for him to return.


1029
01:10:37.242 --> 01:10:39.008
There is a war coming.
Have you not heard?


1030
01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:41.110
We have to leave now
before they block the roads.


1031
01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.879
We have to wait until she comes home.
I have to wait for my daughter.


1032
01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:46.182
[angry grunt]
Son? Daughter? Which is it?


1033
01:10:46.184 --> 01:10:48.049
Gather your things.
We are leaving now!


1034
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:50.952
I'm not leaving without Parvana.
We have to wait.


1035
01:10:50.954 --> 01:10:52.955
Count yourself lucky
I'm taking you, old woman.


1036
01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.956
The girl and the baby
are of more worth.


1037
01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.858
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.


1038
01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.295
If we do not go now, we won't
get out of here at all.


1039
01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.830
- My baby! Give him to me!
- Let's go! Argh!


1040
01:11:01.832 --> 01:11:03.734
- Zaki! Zaki!
- [Zaki screaming]


1041
01:11:04.769 --> 01:11:07.303
Give me my baby.
Give him to me!


1042
01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:09.475
- No! Give him to me!
- Let go! Let go!


1043
01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:22.654
[engine idling]

1044
01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:26.888
- Salaam, little one.
- Salaam.


1045
01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:30.192
Where are you going to
with an old man's stick?


1046
01:11:30.194 --> 01:11:32.795
It belongs to my Baba.

1047
01:11:32.797 --> 01:11:35.767
I'm taking it to him,
to the prison.


1048
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.537
I see.

1049
01:11:39.304 --> 01:11:41.539
We're going that way.

1050
01:11:48.712 --> 01:11:50.345
- [Zaki crying]
- Give me my baby!


1051
01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:53.883
- Let's go! If you want to keep the baby, come with me!
- Zaki!


1052
01:11:53.885 --> 01:11:55.918
My daughter
is out there.


1053
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.321
Then what kind of fool are you
to have sent her out alone?


1054
01:11:58.323 --> 01:12:01.223
Get in, or she won't be the
only child you'll lose today!


1055
01:12:01.225 --> 01:12:04.026
Don't...
Give me my baby!


1056
01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:05.928
Keep him quiet!

1057
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.897
I am begging you.

1058
01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:12.804
- [engine cranking]
- Wait for my daughter!


1059

[shouting
in Afghan language]


1060
01:13:00.017 --> 01:13:03.251
Come, Soraya.
We must start a fire.


1061
01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:05.053
- [men shouting]
- [knocking]


1062
01:13:05.055 --> 01:13:06.856

01:13:15.899 --> 01:13:18.099
- Open the door!
- Get away from the door, you stupid kid!

01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:20.369
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Get out of here!

It's all right.
He's my son.

You're wanted inside.

That boy needs
some discipline.

That's my business.

It's Wednesday. I've come
to meet your cousin Roshan.

Roshan has gone to fight.

1079
01:13:51.836 --> 01:13:56.108
We've been brought from the city to clear the
prison of anyone who won't fight for us.


1080
01:13:57.341 --> 01:13:59.140
- The teacher...
- Is he alive?

I don't know.

1082

The teacher is my father.
I am Parvana, his daughter.


1083

Help him, please.

If I'm not back before the
sun has gone down, you run.

Run as far away as you can from
here and you keep on running.

You can't stay here after sunset.
Do you understand?

called Sulayman.

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:42.918
He knew his heart was fated
