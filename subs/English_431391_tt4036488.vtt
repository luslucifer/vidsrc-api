[narrator] For decades, their work
was dismissed as simply vandalism.


41
00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.289
Now, it's the target of a multimillion-
dollar international art grab,


42
00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:06.669
paintings removed from public spaces
without the artist's permission


43
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:11.549
and sold at high-end art fairs,
galleries, and auction houses.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:13.551
[Risk] You know, at least give me
the right to say

be at an auction.

what I want to sell or not sell.


48
00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.686
[narrator] The most valuable?

49
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.980
Works by British artist Banksy.

50
00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:31.361
His work is selling very well
at auctions for millions.


51
00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:36.407
[Ben Eine] There is, yeah, insane value
in the stuff that he paints.


52
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.577
[Glen Friedman] It's like fucking buying
elephant tusks or something. It's like,


53
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:41.496
here's this beautiful, incredible animal,

54
00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.040
and you're just killing it
just so you could own a part of it?


55
00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.458
That is fucking foul.

56
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.795
[narrator] This was supposed
to be the story of what happened


57
00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.047
when Banksy came to San Francisco.

58
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.508
Well, it's a Banksy.

59
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.345
Instead, it became the story
of art dealers...


60
00:03:57.428 --> 00:03:59.639
If they would have balls,
they would say,


61
00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:02.058
"It's a real Banksy, so we show it."

62
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.643
...museums...

63
00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:05.812
So, he's the Socialist rat.

[laughs]

65
00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:08.398
...and money.

66
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:12.527
Last offer I had from a collector
was for $700,000.


67
00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:17.031
What would you do
if you were offered a small fortune


68
00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:20.660
for a painting
the artist didn't want sold?


69
00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:23.913
I got people that want to buy it
for $700,000,


70
00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.040
but I can't give it away for free.

71
00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:51.274
My name is Ben Eine,
and I was a graffiti artist.


72
00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:54.736
And now I'm a street artist for...

73
00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.863
yeah, want of a better phrase.

74
00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:02.535
My style is a form of typography,

75
00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:07.999
exploring words, their meanings,
taking things out of context.


76
00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.795
We rock hardest!

77
00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:16.382
It's a fucking cool name!

78
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.014
A lot of the work I do on the street
is huge, great big words,


79
00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:25.475
or sentences or messages,

80
00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.602
or random, individual letters.

81
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.276
Yeah, pretty much words and letters.

82
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.112
Not pretty pictures and blue skylines.

83
00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.657
Our roots are in graffiti.

84
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.494
Our interest was,
you know, the letter form,


85
00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.954
you know, exploring words,
exploring letters,


86
00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:49.707
changing the shapes of things.

["Strudel Strut" by Romanowski

88
00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.388
It's a global art movement.

89
00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:07.266
You know, you got people
like Roa, for example, from Belgium.


90
00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.144
What he does is just incredibly different

91
00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:13.564
from somebody like Os Gemeos from Brazil

92
00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:15.775
or Herakut from Germany.

93
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.322
Someone came and invited me
to paint in New York.


94
00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:23.908
From there, I went to paint
in Philadelphia.


95
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.661
Last year, we painted
a really beautiful wall in Rome.


96
00:06:26.744 --> 00:06:32.083
Each city crafts and creates
its own artists with its own styles.


97
00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:42.969
Retna, he's developed
a art form based on text,


98
00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:47.807
kind of leans towards,
like, gang graffiti, gang tagging.


99
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.768
He's made it a beautiful art form.

shot at multiple times,


104

of graffiti, you know?

Killed stuff.

108
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.840
[Revok] They send kids here in LA
to prison for eight, nine years,


109
00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:22.425
for doing graffiti.

110
00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.510
This kid Sight went to prison

111
00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:27.305
for eight years for painting graffiti,
nothing else.

Anthony Lister, crazy Australian.

114
00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.148
[Lister] That one looked great
from the roof,


115
00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:39.442
but it wasn't right from the street.

116
00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.612
[Eine] He just embraces
everything that his art is.


117
00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:45.156
I don't care anymore.

118
00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:48.910
He is his art.

119
00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:51.954
[Lister] The street is about me
controlling space.


120
00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.249
It's a fever, you know,
it's a disease, actually.


121
00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:59.378
Mayhem. Craziness. 
The end of the world.

122
00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:01.797
The beginning of the world.

123
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.633
The remembrance of this world.

124
00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:06.928
Doze Green, uh, definitely not boring.

125
00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:11.349
He was there at the very beginning

126
00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:16.062
of the movement
that created this form of art.


127
00:08:19.982 --> 00:08:26.697
Paris in the early '70s, it was a movement
based around protest,


128
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:29.867
and Blek le Rat was one
of the people that was doing that,


129
00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:33.621
and, you know,
he's continued doing it to this day.


130
00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:38.584
If you count the number of artists

131
00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:42.255
who are involved in this movement

132
00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:45.216
all over the world,
it's absolutely huge number.


133
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:59.230
It's really huge, and I guess people
won't know how huge


134
00:08:59.313 --> 00:09:01.148
until it goes in the history books.

135
00:09:01.232 --> 00:09:03.651
[Eine] Shoe, he stopped doing graffiti

136
00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:07.113
and he took his art form
in a different direction,


137
00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:09.740
and it's calligraphy, it's spray paint,

138
00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:11.951
and, again, he works with the letter form.

139
00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:29.385
["Taliban Rockers"
by Romanowski playing]


140
00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:36.559
The most famous street artist
is definitely Banksy.


141
00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:44.150
I think Banksy great.
We needed a Banksy.


142
00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.694
He's got something up here,
and he's saying something always.


143
00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:49.071
His creativity, just being totally clever,

144
00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.656
having something important to say.

145
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.410
[Revok] I think that Banksy has become
some a cultural happening


146
00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.954
that there's been,
like, the Banksy effect.


147
00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:00.583
[Eine] I think Banksy'd been
in London about a year,


148
00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:05.463
and I'd seen these strange stencils,
these strange messages,


149
00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:11.052
these monkeys proclaiming
that one day they'll rule the world,


150
00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:14.764
these little rats with paintbrushes
that had written messages around,


151
00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.892
and it was like, "This is interesting.

152
00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:20.061
This is funnier than graffiti."

153
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.775
One of the things that adds
to Banksy's fame,


154
00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.985
you know, it's a curse,

155
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:31.572
is how secretive of his identity he is.

156
00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:34.325
No one knows who
he is, who he is,

157
00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:35.826
what he looks like,

158
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.871
what she looks like, so...

159
00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:41.832
[narrator] Ben Eine is one
of a handful of artists


160
00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:44.085
who know Banksy's true identity.

161
00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:49.173
[Eine] I first met Banksy
many years ago.


162
00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:53.678
Originally he didn't want people
to know who he was


163
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:58.099
because what he was doing
was, you know, 99% illegal.


164
00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:00.851
Yeah, the police would've loved
to have captured him.


165
00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:02.478
You know, newspapers in England

166
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.564
would actively seek him out.

167
00:11:05.648 --> 00:11:07.692
They all tried to find out
who his parents are,


168
00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.360
try to find out who his friends are,

169
00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:11.112
try to find out
what school he went to.

170
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.114
They want to expose him.

171
00:11:13.948 --> 00:11:15.825
[Risk] Banksy did
what we all want to do, man.


172
00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.159
You know, he made it, he did it,

173
00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.578
and, uh, he's doing it, and...

174
00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:21.747
You know, I think it's funny,
a lot of people are like,


175
00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:23.499
"Oh, man, he's not real.
He's not real."


176
00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:27.378
He's more real than all the people
saying he's not real.


177
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:28.963
I know that for sure, you know?

178
00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:35.428
Everybody's aware that Banksy is,
you know, the biggest thing in street art.


179
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.116
[narrator] In April of 2010,
Banksy came to San Francisco.


180
00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:03.247
[Mike Cuffe] There were thousands
of people that came to San Francisco


181
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.792
from LA, Nevada, Utah, 
Washington State.

182
00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:09.378
People came here
just to kind of do the Banksy tour.


183
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.844
I'd get a text message
at 12 midnight the next night,


184
00:12:16.927 --> 00:12:18.679
"Hey, another piece just popped up."

185
00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.436
[Eine] People saw what happened
to Andy Warhol.


186
00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.022
Banksy's compared, you know,
the next Andy Warhol.


187
00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:30.274
This is the Chinatown piece,

188
00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:33.027
and this is, I believe,
the first piece that was put up.


189
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.197
The funny thing about this piece
is they actually went into the bakery


190
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.659
a couple days before, and they actually
handed the bakery owners 50 bucks


191
00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:43.120
and said, "Do you mind if, you know,
we paint on your wall?"


192
00:12:43.204 --> 00:12:47.333
And they were, you know,
said, "Sure. What do we care?"


193
00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:48.542
[chatter]

194
00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:51.128
[woman] I like that it has
a message to it.


195
00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:53.297
There's a lot of graffiti
that has beautiful pictures,


196
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.218
but his artwork is the kind
that makes you think about things,


197
00:12:57.301 --> 00:12:59.845
and it's usually promoting peace
and nonviolence.


198
00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:02.014
[Cuffe] It's been funny
to watch it transition


199
00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:06.644
from a community
that had no idea who Banksy was


200
00:13:06.727 --> 00:13:10.272
to one that just, you know,
loves this piece.


201
00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.775
It's now a piece
of the history of Chinatown.


202
00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:15.778
I think, at the time,
he was on a tour of America.


203
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:19.823
But, yeah, he came to San Francisco
and painted a lot of stuff.


204
00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:21.116
[man] It's a beautiful wall.

205
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.535
I've actually hoped somebody

206
00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:25.454
was gonna do something here
for a long time,


207
00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.998
and hoped that it wasn't gonna suck.

208
00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:31.752
And, uh, it doesn't,
so we kind of lucked out.


209
00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:36.465
[Cuffe] This is the Indian that was done
on Sycamore in the Mission.


210
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.343
They actually backed up
with a moving truck,


211
00:13:39.426 --> 00:13:41.428
and they had two mattresses.

212
00:13:41.512 --> 00:13:47.393
And they put two mattresses
on either side of the-- this-- the wall.


213
00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:49.728
And then they stationed two guys
on each side,


214
00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:51.313
like, talking on their cell phones,

215
00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.399
just like, you know,
someone's moving stuff.


216
00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:56.944
They really are strategic
about not getting caught.


217
00:13:57.027 --> 00:14:01.323
There's not a lot of other street artists
that have a team or a crew of people


218
00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.119
that act as diversions so they don't
get picked up by the cops.


219
00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:08.122
[narrator] Each morning,
the city woke to a new painting.


220
00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:10.833
This is the piece on Mission,
the bird in the tree.


221
00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.209
This is an interesting piece.

222
00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:14.211
Most people see just the tree,
but if you look,


223
00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.339
this tree in the background
actually makes the foliage on top.


224
00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:20.009
Paintings appeared in Fisherman's Wharf,

225
00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.761
the SOMA district, and North Beach.

226
00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:24.513
[man] I think it's brilliant.

227
00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:27.266
So, I love that he's controversial,

228
00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:31.228
yet he has a consistency in his paintings
and you know it's him,


229
00:14:31.312 --> 00:14:33.731
and then also
there's just a class about it,


230
00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:37.693
'cause it's real, like, minute
and simple and kind of hidden.


231
00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.236
It's not over the top.

232
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.031
This piece, they actually had ladders
going up to the building,


233
00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:44.992
and they draped down huge tarps,

234
00:14:45.075 --> 00:14:47.494
and so they kind
of covered up the ladders.


235
00:14:47.578 --> 00:14:51.540
And there was a party going on,
big party with hundreds of people,


236
00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:54.919
just up on a building over,
kind of across the street.


237
00:14:55.002 --> 00:14:58.255
So, they had to wait for, like, three
or four hours for this party to disperse


238
00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:00.132
to actually get up there
and do this piece.


239
00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:02.885
It probably took 'em,
you know, ten minutes,


240
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:05.554
but they had to wait
about four hours to get it up.

[Slightly Stoopid]
♪ Why am I treated so bad, hmm? ♪


243
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.036
We view artists who paint
on property without permission


244
00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:30.621
as vandals.

245
00:15:30.704 --> 00:15:31.830
They're breaking the law.

246
00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:34.249
Different cities around the world

247
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.835
deal with graffiti, street art,
in different ways.


248
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.800
Basically, they want to get it cleaned off
and they don't want to pay for it.


249
00:15:42.883 --> 00:15:46.220
So, the way
that San Francisco deals with this


250
00:15:46.303 --> 00:15:49.723
is if you're a building owner
and your building gets tagged,


251
00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:53.352
then it's your responsibility
to paint over those tags


252
00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:55.479
or San Francisco will fine you.

253
00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:01.276
There was a lot of this dialog
going on that, you know,


254
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.945
this guy really didn't care about it.

255
00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.822
He just wanted it off his building.

256
00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:10.494
He said the city really was harassing him
about getting it off as fast as possible.


257
00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:14.248
We're able to easily, you know,
put this on their tax bill


258
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:16.875
and add a lien on the property
if they don't pay it.


259
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.336
If he just cuts that out, you know,

260
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.631
that'll go up for auction
for, like, $500,000, easy.


261
00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.341
No doubt, it'll sell,

262
00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:27.428
and, you know, it was painted over.

263
00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:30.389
Under the threat of fines
to the building owners,


264
00:16:30.472 --> 00:16:32.850
the building owners painted over it.

265
00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:37.271
Anything on street level got tagged
over by the graffiti artists, the taggers.


266
00:16:38.105 --> 00:16:42.860
It's been painted over. It's been tagged.
This one is basically destroyed.


267
00:16:42.943 --> 00:16:47.406
So, yeah. Basically as fast
as it went up, it came down.


268
00:16:59.126 --> 00:17:02.880
It's a huge thing for San Francisco
to have these Banksy paintings,


269
00:17:02.963 --> 00:17:06.133
but he'll do one,
and within a couple of days


270
00:17:06.216 --> 00:17:09.678
somebody's painted over it,
tagged over it, and it's gone.

[narrator] San Francisco
resident Brian Greif


272
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.142
watched the paintings disappear one by one

273
00:17:15.225 --> 00:17:17.853
and decided to do something about it.

274
00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:22.775
His plan-- remove a painting
and donate it to a museum.


275
00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:25.861
I just want to save
at least one of them

for more than 48 hours.

It no longer exists.

Our art is developed
with this attitude in mind,


281
00:17:44.213 --> 00:17:45.672
that it's not gonna last

282

that white wall right there,

in the historic
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood,


304
00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:45.399
a massive painting extending
across two buildings.


305
00:18:45.482 --> 00:18:48.902
One on side, a six-foot-tall rat.

306
00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:51.738
On the other, a message to the city.

307
00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:56.410
Apparently, up here on a wall--
Yep, it's up there.


308
00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:02.291
It's still there. There's a Banksy rat
on siding that I can get down,


309
00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:06.461
so I'm gonna go try and see
if I can get permission to get that done.


310
00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:09.423
On one city block you see--
up above, you see,


311
00:19:09.506 --> 00:19:12.885
"This is where I draw the line,"
and then you have you know,


312
00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:16.930
one of Banksy's rats finishing it
on the other side of the building.


313
00:19:17.014 --> 00:19:23.103
The rat is one of Banksy's
most iconic images.


314
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:28.692
[narrator] Banksy has an army of rats
rallied all over the world.


315
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.488
I don't know, why the rat?

316
00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.950
They're cheeky, funny,

317
00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:41.079
nasty, smelly, little things,

318
00:19:41.163 --> 00:19:43.290
a bit like graffiti artists,

319
00:19:43.373 --> 00:19:44.833
a bit like street artists.

320
00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:52.841
Uh, okay. I just talked to them.

321
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.468
The rat's still there.

322
00:19:54.551 --> 00:19:58.847
It's on redwood siding,
so hopefully it can be taken down.


323
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:02.351
The owner is incensed.

324
00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.186
That building is her baby.

325
00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:07.356
She's owned it since,
you know, the late '70s.


326
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.149
It's her pride and joy,

327
00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:13.111
and she's preparing to paint
over the rat.


328
00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:15.864
And I just convinced them
not to paint over it.


329
00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.951
I told them that I want to try
and save it, and I'll work with them,


330
00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:20.452
so they've agreed to hold off.

331
00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:22.037
They're not gonna paint over it.

332
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.250
Hopefully I can get a deal done soon
before they paint over it


333
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:28.001
or the city comes in
and paints over it


334
00:20:28.085 --> 00:20:29.962
or it gets destroyed
like the rest of them.


335
00:20:30.045 --> 00:20:31.797
Have you ever heard
of an artist named Banksy?


336
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.591
Yes, we have.
Wow, that's-- right there.


337
00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:37.636
Oh, that's a Banksy?
That's certainly not graffiti, then.


338
00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:39.554
I mean, it's a respected artist.

339
00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.723
If you cut that out
and you put that on eBay,


340
00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:44.393
it's worth about $10,000,
I mean, I'd say keep it.


341
00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:55.195
Negotiations with the building owner
began in May,


342
00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:58.699
and will take months
of tedious back and forth to complete.


343
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.451
The owner of the building
is so upset


344
00:21:01.535 --> 00:21:04.496
that Banksy painted the rat
on her building, she won't talk to me.


345
00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:06.123
She wants me to talk to her manager,

346
00:21:06.206 --> 00:21:08.583
and the problem is
he won't return phone calls or emails,


347
00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.585
so I'm already kind of at a standstill.

348
00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:13.255
Yeah, from what I understand of the story,

349
00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:14.840
it was a long...

350
00:21:14.923 --> 00:21:17.175
They're worried that I might
damage the building...


351
00:21:17.259 --> 00:21:19.928
-...painful...
-They're worried about the reaction


352
00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.597
-from the community...
-...drawn-out operation.


353
00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.516
They want to sell it.

354
00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:26.184
It's clear now they're trying to sell it.

355
00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:28.270
[keystrokes clacking]

356
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.151
They think they can take it down
and sell it on eBay,


357
00:21:34.234 --> 00:21:37.195
and I'm trying to talk them
out of that.


358
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.073
[Eine] You know, Banksy gave
these people a gift...


359
00:21:45.829 --> 00:21:48.165
and everyone involved in the project

360
00:21:48.248 --> 00:21:50.250
that actually doesn't even care
about the art...


361
00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:56.465
just sees an opportunity
to make some money.


362
00:21:57.174 --> 00:21:59.801
The problem now is the city
keeps sending the building owner


363
00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:01.928
these letters threatening to fine her

364
00:22:02.012 --> 00:22:03.805
if she doesn't take the painting down.

365
00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:07.392
They're actually threatening
to remove the graffiti themselves


366
00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:09.644
if she doesn't remove it
within 30 days.


367
00:22:11.438 --> 00:22:13.065
[narrator] As time ticked by,

368
00:22:13.148 --> 00:22:15.776
the rat was in constant danger.

369
00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.154
So, you can see somebody
got up on the roof last night


370
00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.739
and tagged over the words.

371
00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:22.532
Thankfully, the rat's still in one piece.

372
00:22:22.616 --> 00:22:24.117
They didn't mess with the rat.

373
00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:26.203
I'm gonna have to focus
on getting the rat down.


374
00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:28.121
This is just getting too complicated.

375
00:22:28.205 --> 00:22:31.833
[narrator] August, the deal changes
once again.


376
00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:34.002
My original deal with them months ago

377
00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:36.254
was I would take the rat
off this side of the building,


378
00:22:36.338 --> 00:22:39.049
I would repair damage to the wall
on that side of the building,


379
00:22:39.132 --> 00:22:40.550
and give them a cash donation.

380
00:22:40.634 --> 00:22:41.802
Now the deal's changed.

381
00:22:41.885 --> 00:22:43.970
They still want everything
on that side of the wall,


382
00:22:44.054 --> 00:22:45.514
they still want the cash donation,

383
00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:48.225
but now they want me to repair damage
on the other side of the building,


384
00:22:48.308 --> 00:22:52.979
so we're talking new fees for materials,
carpentry, scaffolding,


385
00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:56.358
lead paint abatement,
permits, legal fees...


386
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:57.943
October.

387
00:22:58.026 --> 00:23:00.278
Gonna cut straight up
and take this whole 16"...


388
00:23:00.362 --> 00:23:05.826
Experts were brought in to figure out
the best way to remove the painting.


389
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:07.160
...go easily back.

390
00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:10.705
Then the cost kept on escalating.

391
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.499
[man on phone] Thanks. Bye-bye.

392
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.710
So, that's a voicemail that I just got

393
00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.754
from the guy that owns
the building next door


394
00:23:17.838 --> 00:23:19.756
to the Red Victorian Inn
where the rat is.


395
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.925
We need access to
the roof of his building

396
00:23:22.008 --> 00:23:24.094
to get scaffolding up
to take the rat down,


397
00:23:24.177 --> 00:23:26.304
and he's found out
who Banksy is now,


398
00:23:26.388 --> 00:23:29.724
and he wants $5,000
for access to his roof.


399
00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:34.312
November. The building owner
has one final request


400
00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:36.565
before the rat could be removed.

401
00:23:37.566 --> 00:23:39.025
We finally have an agreement,

402
00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:43.572
and the last part of the agreement
is she holds a two-hour discussion


403
00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:46.825
at the Red Vic every Sunday morning
about world peace,


404
00:23:46.908 --> 00:23:48.910
and before she'll sign the contract

405
00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:52.247
I have to go to the two-hour
world peace discussion at the Red Vic.


406
00:24:00.755 --> 00:24:02.382
[Greif] I don't need
all of that at the bottom...


407
00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:03.466
[phone ringing]

408
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.260
...where that last piece of siding is.

409
00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:07.888
I just want the
painting from here on up.

410
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:10.015
Oh, awesome, that helps us quite a bit.

411
00:24:10.098 --> 00:24:12.100
Any, if there's-- any of that wood...

412
00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:15.562
All right.

413
00:24:18.064 --> 00:24:19.482
Well, it's a Banksy.

414
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:23.361
It's bringing a lot of attention
to street art,


415
00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:25.405
and street artists in general,
all across the world.


416
00:24:25.488 --> 00:24:27.782
That's, I think the goal
for a lot of street artists,


417
00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:31.286
is they want to engage
with more people,


418
00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.163
connect with more people
through their art.


419
00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:35.165
They don't want to limit
themselves to a gallery,


420
00:24:35.248 --> 00:24:36.458
and the fact that it's free.

421
00:24:37.459 --> 00:24:39.085
You know, well...

422
00:24:40.253 --> 00:24:43.590
This location in particular is--
It's just so damn high.


423
00:24:43.673 --> 00:24:45.217
You're like, "How did he get up there?"

424
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.551
You can see the roof here,

425
00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:48.637
they think he might've stayed
in one of the rooms,


426
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.680
and accessed
through one of these fire escapes


427
00:24:50.764 --> 00:24:52.140
and came up this ladder.

428
00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:55.477
But we're two stories up
above Haight Street in San Francisco,


429
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.188
and it's not easy to get up here.

430
00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:03.193
He got on the
roof and came down here.

431
00:25:03.276 --> 00:25:07.239
They're working right now
to begin taking the painting down.


432
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.951
And there's the rat,
looking down on Haight Street.


433
00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:14.579
[man] I guess we're officially starting.

434
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.667
[Greif] The scoring is the part
that concerns me the most.


435
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.460
[man] So, that's
what he's doing right now.


436
00:25:20.543 --> 00:25:22.504
[Greif] That's what he's doing
right now with the knife.


437
00:25:22.587 --> 00:25:25.590
He's scoring, he's trying to cut
the overlapping paint,


438
00:25:25.674 --> 00:25:26.967
the hundred years of paint,

439
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.012
so we can take
each piece of siding off cleanly.


440
00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:33.390
This is where we have
to be careful, though.


441
00:25:33.473 --> 00:25:37.644
Take care not to keep
from peeling the paint.


442
00:25:37.727 --> 00:25:39.771
[Greif] They can scratch the painting.

443
00:25:39.854 --> 00:25:42.857
Big pieces of paint will come off.

444
00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:45.819
And I hope I didn't spend
an awful lot of money


445
00:25:45.902 --> 00:25:49.572
on a bunch of worthless
hundred-year-old redwood siding.


446
00:25:49.656 --> 00:25:51.741
This is the hardest part
right here, huh?


447
00:25:51.825 --> 00:25:54.119
Uh, I don't know. [chuckles]

448
00:25:54.202 --> 00:25:55.912
I hope so!

449
00:25:55.996 --> 00:25:57.038
[saw whirring]

450
00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:08.717
The second most dangerous part
is actually then,


451
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.927
we're gonna take each piece
of siding down


452
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:12.887
and cut the nails off from behind.

453
00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.973
So, we have to pry it,
get each piece loose,


454
00:26:15.056 --> 00:26:17.267
and then they're gonna cut
the nails from behind


455
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.728
so each piece will come off
without nail pops


456
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:22.022
and without damage to the front.

457
00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:24.024
[man] Relief? [chuckles]

458
00:26:24.107 --> 00:26:25.525
Not-
- No, not yet.

459
00:26:25.608 --> 00:26:26.901
Not yet?

460
00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.112
Nowhere near relief yet.

461
00:26:30.238 --> 00:26:32.115
...worry about the painting.

462
00:26:32.198 --> 00:26:33.992
It's a little bit easier.

463
00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:35.952
-So...
-Here.


464
00:26:36.036 --> 00:26:39.831
But we've got about three feet
of crawlspace there,


465
00:26:39.914 --> 00:26:41.708
so I can crawl back in there
and cut from behind.


466
00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:44.961
...cut from behind,
so this is-- this is good, yeah.


467
00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.181
You're good.

468
00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:01.061
All right, here you go, Brian.

469
00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:07.359
I don't think it could've gone any better.

470
00:27:07.442 --> 00:27:09.361
First major piece is now off.

471
00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:10.987
From here they got room to move,

472
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:13.490
room to saw the nails off from behind.

473
00:27:14.783 --> 00:27:16.034
So far, so good.

474
00:27:27.003 --> 00:27:28.963
You want me to try cutting...

475
00:27:29.964 --> 00:27:33.718
All right. Again, I don't think
it could've gone any better.


476
00:27:34.844 --> 00:27:37.180
-Perfect.
-You want me to try cutting that...


477
00:27:37.263 --> 00:27:38.848
The rat's face!

478
00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:40.475
Critical part.

479
00:27:47.315 --> 00:27:49.484
Last piece.

480
00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.444
-Yeah!
-All right.


481
00:27:51.528 --> 00:27:52.529
It goes.

482
00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:56.408
-Is that it?
-Yep, that's it.


483
00:28:04.624 --> 00:28:07.836
That's it. That's what the Banksy
looks like when it's not on the wall.


484
00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.712
Everything is all wrapped
and ready to go.


485
00:28:09.796 --> 00:28:11.631
We just need to find
somebody to restore it


486
00:28:11.714 --> 00:28:13.133
and find a museum to put it in.

[Romanowski feat. Danny Cao]
♪ You leave your home for days and daze ♪


489
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:35.321
A painting by controversial
British graffiti artist Banksy


490
00:28:35.405 --> 00:28:38.825
has been removed from a building
on Haight Street in San Francisco.


491
00:28:38.908 --> 00:28:41.911
The building's owner received
a notice from the city


492
00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:45.999
to remove that Banksy artwork
under the city's anti-graffiti ordinance.


493
00:28:46.082 --> 00:28:48.835
So, instead of painting over the piece,
the owner of the building


494
00:28:48.918 --> 00:28:51.045
made arrangements
with an art collector


495
00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.797
who plans to restore the painting

496
00:28:52.881 --> 00:28:56.426
and offer it to a museum
for public display.


497
00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:01.973
[Greif] The painting is down.
It's all wrapped.


498
00:29:02.056 --> 00:29:04.934
It's in safe storage,
if you consider the closet


499
00:29:05.018 --> 00:29:07.395
in my one-bedroom apartment safe storage.

500
00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.938
That's where I'm keeping it.

501
00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:14.611
[Eine] As soon as word got out the rat
on Haight-Ashbury was being removed,


502
00:29:14.694 --> 00:29:16.613
offers from around the world
started coming in,


503
00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:18.948
and there were numerous offers

504
00:29:19.032 --> 00:29:20.742
for numerous amounts of money.

505
00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:25.330
I've gotten even faxes from art dealers,

506
00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:27.248
consignment agreements,

507
00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:29.542
offering to pay me over $100,000,

508
00:29:29.626 --> 00:29:32.045
$200,000 in one case.

509
00:29:32.128 --> 00:29:33.588
I'm not gonna back down.

510
00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:37.634
My goal is to find a place to put this
where the public can enjoy it.


511
00:29:37.717 --> 00:29:41.513
Eventually, a meeting was arranged
with John Zarobell


512
00:29:41.596 --> 00:29:44.724
from the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art


513
00:29:44.808 --> 00:29:46.893
about preserving the piece,

514
00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:49.270
about the piece going
into their collection.


515
00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:53.691
Okay, we're pulling up to
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art


516
00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:57.028
and talked to them
about donating the Banksy.


517
00:29:57.111 --> 00:30:00.532
They've said that they're interested
in taking the Banksy from me,


518
00:30:00.615 --> 00:30:03.117
so this is SF MOMA right here.

519
00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.503
[John Zarobell] We touch on a lot
of different worlds of art,


520
00:30:13.586 --> 00:30:16.214
and many curators are involved
in many different domains.


521
00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:19.092
So, when someone like Banksy comes,

522
00:30:19.175 --> 00:30:20.635
that is-- that's got star power

523
00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.637
in a totally different artistic domain,

524
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.223
um, that maybe we're not
the most attentive to.


525
00:30:25.306 --> 00:30:29.185
You know, seeing this,
it's funny because here he blends,


526
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:33.147
A) the stencil, 
B) the loose lettering,

527
00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.692
you know, just sort of writing
with the spray paint,


528
00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:39.362
and then, C) the throwing the paint
on the wall, alá Jackson Pollack.


529
00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:42.532
There's this level of street art,
perhaps teenagers with spray paint,


530
00:30:42.615 --> 00:30:44.951
and then there's his,
which is actually, you know,


531
00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:47.912
a pretty developed pictorial effect.
It's, you know, two-tone.


532
00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:51.332
He's figuring out how to use the stencil
and make it into a complex--


533
00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:52.750
actually, three-tone piece.

534
00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:56.212
I mean, this is
a pretty complex piece of stencil.


535
00:30:57.338 --> 00:31:00.758
You know, this is a very sort
of rudimentary piece of street art,


536
00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:02.385
but it's an antiquated idea, right?

537
00:31:02.468 --> 00:31:04.762
This is sort of love and peace.

538
00:31:04.846 --> 00:31:07.265
Now, this is actually in the Haight.

539
00:31:07.348 --> 00:31:09.976
It's sort of Banksy's iconic rat.

540
00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:13.229
Oh, yeah.
With the little star cap on, right.


541
00:31:13.313 --> 00:31:16.858
So, he's the Socialist rat. [laughs]

542
00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:18.401
-I took it down.
-Mm.


543
00:31:18.484 --> 00:31:20.194
Which is very controversial.

544
00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:24.449
I had an offer last week
from, uh, an art dealer in LA.


545
00:31:24.532 --> 00:31:26.534
-Right.
-He offered me $200,000.


546
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.077
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:30.830
I took that down not to sell it,
but I'm taking it down


548
00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:35.001
in the hopes that I can donate it
somewhere so it is on public display.


549
00:31:35.084 --> 00:31:38.212
-Right.
-So, in my original email to--


550
00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:40.465
-to, I think it was to Peter Denny...
-Mm-hmm.


551
00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:44.052
...was would you be interested
if I donated this piece.


552
00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:47.472
Is it something that SF MOMA
would be interested in?


553
00:31:47.555 --> 00:31:48.806
-Well, I mean--
-As a donation.


554
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.017
That's a really good question,
because as I said,


555
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.936
we have worked with artists
who've done this,


556
00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:55.480
and for us to figure out
what our limits are


557
00:31:55.563 --> 00:31:59.442
and how we understand
what our collection policies are,


558
00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:01.945
this is something that's constantly
expanding and changing.


559
00:32:02.028 --> 00:32:03.988
[woman] I'm actually gonna interrupt here

560
00:32:04.072 --> 00:32:06.616
and say, yeah, I think we
can stop this lying.


561
00:32:06.699 --> 00:32:09.869
Um, is the camera off?

562
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:20.964
They stopped the conversation
and basically ushered us out.


563
00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:25.051
And I got an email
from John Zarobell today that says,


564
00:32:25.134 --> 00:32:27.887
[reading]

565
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:31.766
"I just brought up the possible Banksy
donation to our department head meeting,


566
00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:33.935
and there are a couple of things
we'd like to know.


567
00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:36.771
[reading]

568
00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:39.941
And, he says...

569
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.157
Well, Banksy can't sign off on it
for a number of different reasons.


570
00:32:48.241 --> 00:32:51.661
He doesn't authenticate his street pieces
because people are taking them down


571
00:32:51.744 --> 00:32:54.497
and selling them at auction
for huge amounts of money,


572
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.375
and then the other issue with Banksy
is a legal issue.


573
00:32:57.458 --> 00:33:02.588
If he signs a letter of authentication,
he's admitting to a crime,


574
00:33:02.672 --> 00:33:04.882
since he doesn't get permission
from the building owners


575
00:33:04.966 --> 00:33:06.467
to go up and paint on their buildings.

576
00:33:07.301 --> 00:33:12.056
These institutions are being offered
the chance to own a Banksy for nothing,


577
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.019
no strings attached, and they want
to attach strings to it,


578
00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:18.604
and they want to say no.

579
00:33:18.688 --> 00:33:20.106
I think, at the end of the day,

580
00:33:20.189 --> 00:33:24.110
it's just the old guard
trying to maintain their real estate


581
00:33:24.193 --> 00:33:26.654
and hold on as long as they can.

582
00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:31.034
People would like to see it.
It's, you know, it's exciting.


583
00:33:31.117 --> 00:33:33.828
It blows everything else
out of the water.


584
00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:36.748
But, you know, it's run by old people,
and they don't enjoy it.


585
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:41.878
[man] I just got an email back from
my contact over in Banksy's operation.


586
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:43.379
It seems kind of upbeat.

587
00:33:43.463 --> 00:33:47.133
I would just talk to your MOMA person
and tell them to be on the lookout


588
00:33:47.216 --> 00:33:50.762
for an email in from, um,
it's gonna be Pest Control.


589
00:33:50.845 --> 00:33:53.222
That's Banksy's
little operation over there.


590
00:33:53.306 --> 00:33:55.391
I'll talk to you later.
All right, bye-bye.


591
00:33:56.517 --> 00:33:59.979
So, that's a friend that has contacts
with Banksy's people.


592
00:34:00.063 --> 00:34:02.398
I asked him to call
and see if we could get something


593
00:34:02.482 --> 00:34:04.442
so we could get this in SF MOMA,

594
00:34:04.525 --> 00:34:07.111
and as you heard on the call,
he sounds optimistic.


595
00:34:16.996 --> 00:34:18.915
Some artists make work for...

596
00:34:18.998 --> 00:34:20.249
to be destroyed, right?

597
00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:21.834
They don't want the art to survive.

598
00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:22.919
And if that's the case,

599
00:34:23.002 --> 00:34:24.295
it's not the museum's business

600
00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:27.298
to preserve it
against the wishes of the artist.


601
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:30.384
[man] Again, you were looking
for some sort of document


602
00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.386
or letter or something from Banksy

603
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.764
that said, "I want this in the museum."

604
00:34:34.847 --> 00:34:38.101
That, and also, of course,
to say, "Yes, this is my work."


605
00:34:38.184 --> 00:34:41.020
And with street art, obviously, that's
the kind of issue that it wouldn't be


606
00:34:41.104 --> 00:34:42.939
if you were buying a work of art
from a dealer.


607
00:34:43.022 --> 00:34:46.150
The museum wouldn't accept it
unless they had a document


608
00:34:46.234 --> 00:34:50.029
from Banksy's people saying
it was a real Banksy.


609
00:34:51.072 --> 00:34:53.449
[Cuffe] For all you San Franciscans
that are wondering


610
00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:55.243
if these were authentic Banksies,

611
00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:58.663
you come to his site,
go on his Outdoor section.


612
00:34:58.746 --> 00:35:00.873
Chinatown piece.

613
00:35:00.957 --> 00:35:02.834
This is how he authenticates it.

614
00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:03.960
Puts up a picture.

615
00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:06.671
This is the piece on Mission,
the bird and the tree.


616
00:35:06.754 --> 00:35:09.382
Here you have the piece on Sycamore.

617
00:35:10.216 --> 00:35:12.468
This is the piece on Valencia.

618
00:35:13.136 --> 00:35:17.181
This is the piece
at the Regency Ballroom, in the alley.


619
00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:21.561
The beginning of the piece on the Haight,
"This is where I draw the line."


620
00:35:21.644 --> 00:35:25.273
And then you have, you know,
one of Banksy's rats


621
00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:27.275
finishing it
on the other side of the building.


622
00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.818
[Zarobell] We don't want to do something

623
00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:31.028
that the artist doesn't feel
is appropriate, right?


624
00:35:31.112 --> 00:35:34.782
If a work of art is made
for a public venue to be out in public,


625
00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:37.285
then perhaps the artist doesn't want
to see it in a museum.


626
00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:40.371
Graffiti, street art, it scares them.

627
00:35:40.454 --> 00:35:42.540
You know, if they had any idea,

628
00:35:42.623 --> 00:35:44.333
they would be buying it now,

629
00:35:44.417 --> 00:35:46.836
snapping it up,
and putting it in their collection.


630
00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:50.381
Graffiti to them is so new,
they don't know good and bad.


631
00:35:50.464 --> 00:35:52.884
You know, they don't know the difference
between this kid,


632
00:35:52.967 --> 00:35:55.595
this little kid that's picked up
a spray can for the first time


633
00:35:55.678 --> 00:35:58.472
and this guy that's been doing it
for 20, 30 years.


634
00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.808
To them, they don't know the difference.

635
00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.936
There are too many people in this world
you can make happy with this,


636
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.274
to-- to worry about those
who don't appreciate it, so...


637
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.651
We'll just go where people like us.

638
00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:17.283
The question is when are we gonna be
recognized by the people in power?


639
00:36:17.366 --> 00:36:19.452
I don't know when it's gonna be.

640
00:36:19.535 --> 00:36:21.287
Maybe in ten years, 20 years.

641
00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.539
Maybe when old people...

642
00:36:24.874 --> 00:36:29.712
Maybe when the movement
will be finished, I don't know.


643
00:36:29.795 --> 00:36:32.006
It's a very difficult question.

644
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.550
Three modern museums
were offered the painting.


645
00:36:34.634 --> 00:36:37.803
None of them were interested
in taking it unless there was


646
00:36:37.887 --> 00:36:40.932
a document from Banksy's people
saying it was a real Banksy,


647
00:36:41.015 --> 00:36:42.558
although it obviously was.

648
00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:52.735
[narrator] The museums weren't interested.

649
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.155
But other people were.

650
00:36:56.239 --> 00:36:58.574
I think the ones on concrete,
they are very powerful.


651
00:36:58.658 --> 00:37:03.371
Stephan Keszler is one of the world's
leading dealers of Banksy street pieces.


652
00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:08.084
He sells Banksy paintings,
but without the artist's permission.


653
00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:12.296
In the street art world,
he's considered a shyster, a villain.


654
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.260
Himself, he considers himself
to be Banksy's biggest fan.


655
00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:21.305
In my opinion,
there's nothing more beautiful


656
00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:23.182
to, uh, see...

657
00:37:24.892 --> 00:37:26.852
original Banksy street works,

658
00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:29.230
because they're really amazing.

659
00:37:30.439 --> 00:37:32.942
All over the world,
these paintings were removed.


660
00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:36.696
They wind up in auction, and they go
for hundreds of thousands of dollars.


661
00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:38.739
[man] Is that Banksy?

662
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.534
-Banksy.
-It is?


663
00:37:41.617 --> 00:37:43.160
[Friedman] People make art,
they make it in context.


664
00:37:43.244 --> 00:37:45.079
There's a reason
that they're doing it, right?


665
00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:47.290
And for someone to buy art
taken out of context


666
00:37:47.373 --> 00:37:48.708
or taken off of a wall

667
00:37:48.791 --> 00:37:51.711
or, you know, appropriated
without the artist's permission,


668
00:37:51.794 --> 00:37:54.380
I mean, why are you doing that,
for a fucking investment?


669
00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:57.133
What I do if I
take a piece of art

670
00:37:57.216 --> 00:38:01.178
that kids could profit from
by looking at it


671
00:38:01.262 --> 00:38:06.058
and I turn it into this good
that just benefits myself,


672
00:38:06.142 --> 00:38:08.894
it's really depriving
my neighborhood children


673
00:38:08.978 --> 00:38:10.438
of seeing something beautiful.

674
00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:13.399
We have an expertise
how to handle these pieces,


675
00:38:13.482 --> 00:38:16.319
how to get them from the wall,
how to help them.


676
00:38:16.402 --> 00:38:18.779
We will never taken them
personally from the wall,


677
00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:22.908
but I think it's better to take them
from the wall than--


678
00:38:22.992 --> 00:38:24.952
from a house wall or a garage--

679
00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:27.496
than to have white paint over them

680
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.582
because then they are gone forever.

681
00:38:29.665 --> 00:38:31.167
I just think it's self-serving.

682
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.045
It's pretty selfish for a person
to take something off


683
00:38:34.128 --> 00:38:38.632
that is actually, like, there
for the public to enjoy or hate,


684
00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.593
but it's still there for the public.

685
00:38:41.594 --> 00:38:45.431
Yeah, you know, you know,
we paint stuff on the street.


686
00:38:45.514 --> 00:38:47.350
That's where it belongs.

687
00:38:47.433 --> 00:38:50.311
Some of these works are massive,

688
00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:53.230
and, you know, weigh thousands of pounds.

689
00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:56.359
Yeah, you know, they're cut out
from fucking brick walls,


690
00:38:56.442 --> 00:38:59.820
concrete walls, jackhammers,
diamond-tipped saws,


691
00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.655
packaged up, stored,

692
00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:04.867
and then six months later
wind up in an auction house,


693
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.412
and that's not where they're meant to be.

694
00:39:08.496 --> 00:39:14.251
His work is selling
very well at auctions for millions.


695
00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:21.092
His work is collected
at very high-end collectors.


696
00:39:21.175 --> 00:39:25.429
You know, we make stuff in our studios,
and this is the stuff we sign,


697
00:39:25.513 --> 00:39:26.680
this is the stuff we sell,

698
00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:30.976
this is the stuff that we want
to represent us in the future.


699
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.313
This is the stuff that,
if it turns up in auction,


700
00:39:34.397 --> 00:39:36.816
you know, we're proud
for it to be there.

701
00:39:36.899 --> 00:39:39.944
The stuff we paint
on the street isn't that.


702
00:39:40.027 --> 00:39:42.279
-[siren wailing]
-You know, it's for the people,


703
00:39:42.363 --> 00:39:45.408
it's for fun, it's for adventure,

704
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:47.034
it's for adrenaline.

705
00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.869
It's not to turn up in auction.

706
00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.081
I do all kinds of artwork, but there's
a lot of stuff I don't want in a gallery.


707
00:39:52.164 --> 00:39:53.791
It's not meant to be in a gallery.

708
00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:55.793
It's not meant to be in an auction.

709
00:39:55.876 --> 00:39:57.711
You know, at least give me
the right to say


710
00:39:57.795 --> 00:40:00.214
what's gonna be in a gallery
or be at an auction.


711
00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:03.092
You can hate my stuff, you can love
my stuff, you can steal my stuff.


712
00:40:03.175 --> 00:40:06.178
Give me the right to say
what I want to sell or not sell.


713
00:40:06.262 --> 00:40:08.848
[Eine] I never sign the stuff
that I paint in the street.


714
00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:13.602
Everything I've ever painted
in the street as the artist "Ben Eine,"


715
00:40:13.686 --> 00:40:15.271
I never put my tag to it.

716
00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:18.858
You know, I don't want that stuff
turning up at auction.


717
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:22.403
[narrator] Banksy has condemned the sale
of his public works,


718
00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:25.948
but Keszler says he's doing
Banksy a favor.


719
00:40:26.031 --> 00:40:32.455
I think if Banksy is honest
to himself sometimes,


720
00:40:32.538 --> 00:40:35.875
when he goes to bed
and he doesn't have to do his PR,


721
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:40.713
I think, in a way,
he's thankful that we do this.


722
00:40:45.468 --> 00:40:47.803
Keszler was organizing
a controversial exhibit


723
00:40:47.887 --> 00:40:50.222
at the world's
largest art fair in Miami...


724
00:40:51.724 --> 00:40:55.895
an exhibit showcasing
four Banksy street pieces,


725
00:40:55.978 --> 00:40:58.314
all without the artist's permission.

726
00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:04.153
We acquiring more Banksy street works,

727
00:41:04.236 --> 00:41:06.489
and the other thing is,

728
00:41:06.572 --> 00:41:09.783
uh, we would like to show this,
as I said before,


729
00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:12.453
to as many people
in the world as possible.


730
00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:15.247
You know, this isn't a Banksy show.

731
00:41:15.331 --> 00:41:19.376
It's a show of his work
taken from the street.


732
00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:23.881
You know, newspeople
from all around the world were interested.


733
00:41:23.964 --> 00:41:25.633
It was extremely controversial.

734
00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:28.761
[narrator] Keszler claimed
after the exhibit


735
00:41:28.844 --> 00:41:30.012
some of his Banksy pieces

736
00:41:30.095 --> 00:41:32.097
would be donated to a museum.

737
00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:35.184
Our goal would be, or is,

738
00:41:35.267 --> 00:41:38.687
that maybe when people see these works

739
00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:42.107
and talk about these works
at this high-end venue


740
00:41:42.191 --> 00:41:47.029
that we can make a deal
with some of the museums,


741
00:41:47.112 --> 00:41:48.781
better museums in the world,

742
00:41:48.864 --> 00:41:52.618
and we would love to give
those works to museums


743
00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:54.495
to show to more people.

744
00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:58.332
So, I just got this email
from Stephan Keszler's gallery,


745
00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.584
-and it says...
-Desperate to find a home for the rat...


746
00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:03.921
[reading]

747
00:42:04.004 --> 00:42:07.591
...Brian called Keszler
to discuss museums.


748
00:42:07.675 --> 00:42:10.553
[Greif] My original intent
was to take it down and donate it


749
00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:13.430
to the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art.


750
00:42:13.514 --> 00:42:15.933
Yeah, you see, everybody's afraid

751
00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:19.478
to do certain things
which Banksy doesn't want,


752
00:42:19.562 --> 00:42:24.525
and Banksy doesn't want to do this
because then if he says to one museum,


753
00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:28.445
"Okay, you get a street piece
and I authenticate it," right,


754
00:42:28.529 --> 00:42:30.406
then he made an exception

they would say,

"It's a real Banksy, so we show it."

Keszler wanted the Banksy rat, yeah.

At this time, he had a lot
of Banksy pieces,

and he wanted that in his show.

One of the provisions for Miami
allowing the show to go on

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.796
was none of these pieces
were for sale.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.551
He also told me that after the show
there's a potential museum in Miami


777
00:43:32.635 --> 00:43:34.762

782

it's pretty big...

It's the top of the rat's hat.

And, yeah, it's, like I say,
it's not a small rat.


787
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.339
It's a big rat.

788
00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:13.342
Since it was taken down,
I haven't seen it all put together,

00:44:13.425 --> 00:44:17.429

how it held up in my closet,

wrapped in old blankets
and sheets for two years.

of other people without asking.

then I obviously feel like I have rights,

So it's a hypocritical argument,
what he does.

904
00:50:52.407 --> 00:50:55.786
So, I can understand that it doesn't
necessarily fit his aesthetic


905
00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:59.080
to be on the wall
inside a museum or a gallery.


906
00:50:59.164 --> 00:51:01.625
He doesn't trust the gallery system.

907
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:05.086
He doesn't necessarily agree
with how it works.


908
00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:08.340
Uh, he wants to do
everything on his terms,


909
00:51:08.423 --> 00:51:11.551
and, you know,
he's successful at doing that.


910
00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.178
There is a big market now,

911
00:51:13.261 --> 00:51:17.224
a big, very important market
of street art,


912
00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:20.477
a lot of money is involved
in street art now,


913
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.978
a lot of money.

914
00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:26.024
This hype about Banksy right now
where nobody knows who he is


915
00:51:26.107 --> 00:51:29.611
and what he is, I think,
is a very strategic and smart way


916
00:51:29.694 --> 00:51:33.448
from him to get his work
and to get him more famous.


917
00:51:34.115 --> 00:51:37.452
[narrator] In 2005, Banksy
did several paintings


918
00:51:37.536 --> 00:51:39.329
on the division wall in Palestine.

919
00:51:39.412 --> 00:51:42.165
Ben Eine was with him.

920
00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:44.960
I went to Palestine with Banksy.

921
00:51:45.043 --> 00:51:50.131
Uh, it was our first trip
to Palestine, and...


922
00:51:50.215 --> 00:51:54.302
Yeah, we went and painted
quite a few pieces


923
00:51:54.386 --> 00:51:55.971
on the segregation wall,

924
00:51:56.054 --> 00:51:58.723
on bombed ruins,

925
00:51:58.807 --> 00:52:01.643
on basically huge lumps of concrete.

926
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.397
And we spent two weeks over there
painting all day, every day,


927
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.650
and, yeah, we left Palestine,

928
00:52:08.733 --> 00:52:12.320
and we never expected to see
any of those paintings again.


929
00:52:16.616 --> 00:52:18.368
Two of them turn up in Miami.

930
00:52:19.995 --> 00:52:21.162
This is Wet Dog.

931
00:52:21.246 --> 00:52:24.583
He made it in 2007, uh, in Palestine.

932
00:52:24.666 --> 00:52:27.377
It's about 1,800 pounds.

933
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.920
It's a really heavy piece.

934
00:52:29.004 --> 00:52:31.882
We restored it the
way it is right now,

935
00:52:31.965 --> 00:52:37.512
and it was seen on the stone
next to a bus station in Palestine.


936
00:52:37.596 --> 00:52:39.389
And now it's here.

937
00:52:39.472 --> 00:52:41.433
This piece is Stop and Search.

938
00:52:41.516 --> 00:52:45.395
It was also made in 2007
in Palestine, West Bank.


939
00:52:45.478 --> 00:52:48.565
It shows a little girl with a soldier

940
00:52:48.648 --> 00:52:51.359
from the occupying force of Israel,

941
00:52:51.443 --> 00:52:54.112
and this was a very strong statement
of Banksy


942
00:52:54.195 --> 00:52:57.282
to protest against what is going on
in the Middle East.


943
00:52:57.365 --> 00:53:00.327
You see here all the bullets,
shots in there,


944
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:04.331
so I think this is one of the most famous
Banksy pieces in the world.


945
00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.790
I mean, I can't imagine someone

946
00:53:05.874 --> 00:53:07.709
going to the Middle East,

947
00:53:07.792 --> 00:53:10.420
where there's been conflict for, you know,

948
00:53:10.503 --> 00:53:12.589
thousands of years,

949
00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:14.883
and an artist
in this day and age goes there,


950
00:53:14.966 --> 00:53:17.052
seeing what's going on politically,

951
00:53:17.135 --> 00:53:18.720
and is trying to make a statement,

952
00:53:18.803 --> 00:53:21.014
you know, and share something
with the people


953
00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:23.683
and try and make a positive impact,

954
00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.937
and some fucking asshole comes
and just takes the shit off a wall there


955
00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.730
and tries to sell it to someone

956
00:53:28.813 --> 00:53:31.107
in a fancy neighborhood
somewhere else in the world


957
00:53:31.191 --> 00:53:33.193
who happens to have
enough money to pay for it?


958
00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.486
I mean, what the fuck is that?

959
00:53:34.569 --> 00:53:35.946
I mean, what sense does that make?

960
00:53:36.029 --> 00:53:40.700
He's trying to, like, soothe
a very chaotic and sensitive place


961
00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:43.203
with some art, you know, for the people,

962
00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.913
and then some fucking asshole

963
00:53:44.996 --> 00:53:48.041
comes out of left field
and, like, because he can make a buck,


964
00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:52.587
you know, like, rips it out
and like, you know...


965
00:53:52.671 --> 00:53:54.381
It's deplorable.

966
00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:57.759
Do we profit from it? Yes.

967
00:53:57.842 --> 00:54:00.595
Do we put a lot
of effort into it? Yes.

968
00:54:00.679 --> 00:54:02.097
So we both deserve it.

969
00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.225
[Eine] Keszler knew that the rat
was preserved.


970
00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.726
He wanted to buy it.

971
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.270
He obviously had people
that wanted to buy it from him.


972
00:54:09.354 --> 00:54:11.481
He wanted to own this painting.

973
00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:15.276
Yeah. So, the first thing is
it's not for sale here.


974
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.570
So there's not even
a discussion about this.


975
00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:22.826
And, um... I think it's, right now,
my guess is


976
00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:25.495
that it's not--
It's not a million dollars.


977
00:54:25.578 --> 00:54:26.621
It's not.

978
00:54:27.455 --> 00:54:29.916
Also, my big pieces
are not a million dollars.


979
00:54:30.917 --> 00:54:32.752
So, I think it's-
- I--

980
00:54:34.129 --> 00:54:36.172
I think it's a couple of hundred--

981
00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:39.050
I
-I
-I think I could sell it easily--

982
00:54:39.134 --> 00:54:42.887
Easily-- This cost me
hundred thousand dollars also here.


983
00:54:42.971 --> 00:54:45.015
I think I could sell it for...

984
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.644
Two hundred, two hundred fifty,
net, for you.


985
00:54:49.728 --> 00:54:54.190
Well, then I would--
I would get a hundred thousand.


986
00:54:54.274 --> 00:54:56.609
So three hundred fifty, more or less,

987
00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:59.612
and you would get two hundred fifty
or something like this.


988
00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:04.576
You know, it's frustrating,
but, you know, when money gets involved,


989
00:55:04.659 --> 00:55:07.162
this is what happens.

990
00:55:07.245 --> 00:55:08.663
But this is much more...

991
00:55:09.914 --> 00:55:11.666
sellable, or commercial,

992
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:16.087
because you can hang 250 pounds
better in your apartment


993
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:20.091
than a 3,000
or 2,000 pound concrete wall.


994
00:55:21.176 --> 00:55:24.637
[narrator] What happened
to Keszler's Banksies after the exhibit?


995
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:27.807
[auctioneer] We can start the auction,
and we start with the Lot 1.


996
00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:31.019
[narrator] Wet Dog,
one of the pieces from Palestine,


997
00:55:31.102 --> 00:55:33.021
turned up at an auction in Miami,

998
00:55:33.104 --> 00:55:35.815
alongside a new Banksy street piece

999
00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:38.068
called Slave Labor.

1000
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:42.614
[auctioneer] ...70,000, 80,000, 90,000...

1001
00:55:42.697 --> 00:55:44.741
[auctioneer fades]

1002
00:56:15.647 --> 00:56:20.860
I'm back from Miami, and I brought back
the actual catalog for Art Miami,


1003
00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:25.865
and the very first piece featured
in this big, thick catalog is my Banksy.


1004
00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:28.576
And then you flip to the next page,

1005
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.871
and another picture
of my Banksy from the Red Vic,


1006
00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:34.833
along with the other Banksies
that were exhibited.


1007
00:56:34.916 --> 00:56:37.544
There shouldn't be a price tag on them.
They shouldn't be at auction.


1008
00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:41.506
They should be out in the public
where people can enjoy them for free.


1009
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:43.508
Keszler wanted the Banksy rat.

1010
00:56:43.591 --> 00:56:46.678
So, here's an email
directly from Stephan Keszler.


1011
00:56:46.761 --> 00:56:49.222
It says, "We're putting together
our new brochure


1012
00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.558
for Banksy originals...

1013
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.644
[reading]

1014
00:56:58.273 --> 00:57:02.193
If yes, I would suggest a minimum price
we both have to agree on,


1015
00:57:02.277 --> 00:57:03.820
and an equal share.

1016
00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.992
Thanks, Stephan."

1017
00:57:09.075 --> 00:57:11.703
The rat wasn't for sale.
He wanted to buy it.


1018
00:57:11.786 --> 00:57:14.622
The price that he was going
to pay for it kept on going up.


1019
00:57:14.706 --> 00:57:20.044
Two weeks later, there was an offer
of half a million dollars on the table.


1020
00:57:20.128 --> 00:57:25.925
He had called me
and offered me $500,000 for my Banksy.


1021
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.262
And here's the email. It says...

1022
00:57:37.437 --> 00:57:39.898
He seems okay
with my decision at this point,


1023
00:57:39.981 --> 00:57:41.900
but then his tone changes.

1024
00:57:41.983 --> 00:57:45.570
So, this email came the very next day
from Stephan Keszler. It says...


1025
00:57:56.664 --> 00:57:57.707
"Stephan."

1026
00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:01.461
Haven't heard from him since.

1027
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.426
Half a million dollars is a substantial
amount of money by anybody's standards.


1028
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:12.430
You know, to say no to that,
well, obviously this dude's


1029
00:58:12.514 --> 00:58:15.975
not just somebody
who's trying to, you know, flip it


1030
00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:19.479
and, you know, capitalize off of it
and make a quick buck, is he?


1031
00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:24.817
Yeah, you know, this is the irony
of, you know, Banksy street art,


1032
00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.694
you know, taken down from the street.

1033
00:58:26.778 --> 00:58:30.740
Here's this guy that has a Banksy piece
and he wants to give it to a museum,


1034
00:58:30.823 --> 00:58:32.534
and they don't want to take it,

1035
00:58:32.617 --> 00:58:36.496
and yet somebody's prepared
to pay half a million dollars for it.


1036
00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:40.500
You know, it's--
it's the beauty of street art.


1037
00:58:43.169 --> 00:58:47.882
[narrator] Art dealers continue to remove
and sell Banksy's public paintings.


1038
00:58:47.966 --> 00:58:53.221
Banksy doesn't see a single penny
from the sale of these works.


1039
00:58:54.514 --> 00:58:57.433
[Eine] At some point, he'll stop painting.
At some point, he'll die.


1040
00:58:57.517 --> 00:59:00.019
These paintings will never
be made again.


1041
00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:02.021
People want them.

1042
00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:06.734
There's-- yeah, insane value
in the stuff that he paints.


1043
00:59:07.318 --> 00:59:09.153
So, a couple things that I've noticed...

1044
00:59:09.237 --> 00:59:12.615
[narrator] The Haight Street rat was
eventually sent to Southern California


1045
00:59:12.699 --> 00:59:14.909
to be preserved and fully restored.

1046
00:59:14.993 --> 00:59:17.912
[Greif] One of the things I want to do
is protect the edges


1047
00:59:17.996 --> 00:59:20.164
from being banged or chipped...

1048
00:59:20.248 --> 00:59:24.544
[narrator] With preservation,
the total cost of saving the rat?


1049
00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:27.213
Over $40,000.

1050
00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.716
If it is boxed in,
then the frame would obviously be...


1051
00:59:53.364 --> 00:59:56.993
[Greif] So, it's back in San Francisco,
and I'm really happy with the restoration.


1052
00:59:57.076 --> 00:59:59.037
It looks a lot better
than it did in Miami,


1053
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.040
and what I like about the restoration
is I wanted them


1054
01:00:02.123 --> 01:00:05.918
to make it look like it did
on the wall of the building


1055
01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.838
and not, you know,
like a preserved painting,


1056
01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:10.423
and they've done that.

1057
01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.175
You know,
there are still cracks in the paint.


1058
01:00:12.258 --> 01:00:13.509
There are nails.

1059
01:00:13.593 --> 01:00:16.262
You can see the nails
that are sticking out and bent over.


1060
01:00:17.096 --> 01:00:18.973
So, it looks really good.

1061
01:00:19.057 --> 01:00:21.684
[narrator] The restoration
became front-page news


1062
01:00:21.768 --> 01:00:23.728
in the San Francisco Chronicle.

1063
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:28.066
The publicity generated a new wave
of offers from private collectors,


1064
01:00:28.149 --> 01:00:32.403
including an offer of $700,000.

1065
01:00:32.487 --> 01:00:34.906
That offer was rejected.

1066
01:00:39.661 --> 01:00:41.913
[Justin Jack] ♪ I got the money ♪

1067

♪ I got the money for you ♪

1068
01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:45.708
Since the article
in the San Francisco Chronicle,


1069
01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:48.086
I've been flooded with people
that want to show it


1070
01:00:48.169 --> 01:00:49.962
and people that want to buy it,

1071
01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:52.590
but unfortunately, none of them
are really good fits.


1072
01:00:52.674 --> 01:00:53.716
I had somebody call me--

1073
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.470
they wanted to put it up
on the gate outside their house,


1074
01:00:57.553 --> 01:01:00.056
in the redwoods north of San Francisco,

1075
01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:01.766
which, for me, doesn't work.

1076
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:05.103
So, you know, I'm still looking
for a home for it.


1077
01:01:05.186 --> 01:01:07.522
Hopefully, we'll find a place to put it.

1078
01:01:07.605 --> 01:01:11.484
The last offer I had from a collector
was for $700,000,


1079
01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.111
which I turned down.

1080
01:01:13.194 --> 01:01:14.404
Good for him, man.

1081
01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:16.906
If he's really not doing it for the profit
and he wants it in a museum,


1082
01:01:16.989 --> 01:01:19.784
and he believes that strongly about it,
I think he's doing the right thing


1083
01:01:19.867 --> 01:01:23.246
because eventually, you know, it'll gain
traction and it'll get in a museum.


1084
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.171
[Greif] I've learned a lot,
and I've me a lot of graffiti artists,


1085
01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:34.465
and, you know, they all have
sort of a different take on it.


1086
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:37.385
Some think I never should've touched it
or should've left it up,


1087
01:01:37.468 --> 01:01:39.804
and if it got destroyed, it got destroyed.

1088
01:01:39.887 --> 01:01:43.099
The whole thing with conserving shit

1089
01:01:43.182 --> 01:01:44.851
that's been done on the street,

1090
01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.561
it makes no sense.

1091
01:01:46.644 --> 01:01:50.815
You know, others say it's a good thing,
and I know some of the graffiti artists


1092
01:01:50.898 --> 01:01:54.652
are saying that maybe we need to rethink
this whole temporary art form thing.


1093
01:01:54.736 --> 01:02:00.950
I don't know.
You know, like, right now, today,


1094
01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:04.704
I wouldn't want
one of my paintings preserved.


1095
01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:09.542
A hundred years' time,
when I'm dead and none of them exist,


1096
01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:13.171
I would love for one of my paintings
to be preserved.


1097
01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.841
It's, you know, it's a double-edged sword.

1098
01:02:16.924 --> 01:02:21.554
The art that was done in this movement
in the public, which is important,


1099
01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:23.181
is all gonna be gone.

1100
01:02:23.264 --> 01:02:26.100
So, the whole idea of this being
a temporary art form


1101
01:02:26.184 --> 01:02:31.647
and it's okay if it gets, you know,
painted over or destroyed,


1102
01:02:31.731 --> 01:02:33.274
to me, really needs to be re-thought.

1103
01:02:33.357 --> 01:02:35.735
Well, it's part of history.
You know, we're gonna talk about,


1104
01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.737
"You remember when people
were taking all of our pieces


1105
01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.739
and putting them in museums.
We didn't want them there"?


1106
01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.742
There's gonna be a period of work that's,
you know, work that's out of context.


1107
01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.495
It's gonna be all this work
that's like, "What period was that from?"


1108
01:02:45.578 --> 01:02:47.830
"Oh, that was the work
that wasn't supposed to be in a museum."


1109
01:02:47.914 --> 01:02:50.833
So it all, you know, it's all relative.

1110
01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:53.753
[Greif] There's no doubt
that it's a Banksy.


1111
01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:56.047
There's no doubt
that it's an important Banksy.


1112
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.925
It's iconic Banksy imagery.

1113
01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:03.513
For it to be protected and to then take on
an entirely new life and last,


1114
01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:05.348
even if it's in a different context,

1115
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:08.851
just keeping it for,
you know, historical sake


1116
01:03:08.935 --> 01:03:10.937
or whatever, like, yeah, that's rad.

1117
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.316
If you can save art, it's... Do it.

1118
01:03:16.317 --> 01:03:19.695
[Greif] You know, Banksy pieces like this
either get destroyed


1119
01:03:19.779 --> 01:03:22.490
or they get sold and they end up
in somebody's house


1120
01:03:22.573 --> 01:03:24.158
where the public can't see it.

1121
01:03:24.242 --> 01:03:27.620
And, you know, we were able
to take this one down, preserve it,


1122
01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.789
and, you know, hopefully at some point

1123
01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.958
it'll be up in a place
where the public can see it


1124
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.584

it will turn up in a museum,
