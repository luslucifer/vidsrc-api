1
00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:07.563
Bet you're
gonna like it here.


2
00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:08.431
I intend to.

3
00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.335
And you're gonna
write a book here?


4
00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:12.471
My first novel.

5
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.655
What are you guys doing?!

6
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:37.261
Relax, damn it!

7
00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.535
Suck it!

8
00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:46.770
You're gonna die if
you don't suck it!


9
00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.847
Leroy
from Montgomery, Alabama,


10
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.316
what say you?

11
00:00:59.318 --> 00:01:00.417
Miss Hills.

12
00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:01.584
Hi, Leroy.

13
00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:02.718
You can call me Jennifer.

14
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.920
Hi, Jennifer.

15
00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.921
You describe in your book how

16
00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:09.626
just two weeks after the
horrible assault on you,


17
00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:11.894
you seduced the mentally
retarded Matthew


18
00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.531
to have intercourse
with you in the woods.


19
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.733
Then you lured Johnny,
the leader of the gang,


20
00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.738
to have sex with
you in the bathtub.


21
00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:23.639
Those low-lives beat
the hell out of you,


22
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.742
they savagely raped
and sodomized you


23
00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:29.011
and then left you for dead.

24
00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:32.716
How could you chose to give
them, how shall I put it,


25
00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.852
the ultimate pleasure of
life before you killed them?


26
00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:38.721
I wanted them
to be as vulnerable as I was


27
00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:40.891
when they assaulted me.

28
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:44.760
Naked, defenseless and helpless.

29
00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:49.700
And then, to strike them
at their supreme moment.


30
00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:50.733
Supreme moment?

31
00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:51.901
Oh, you mean...

32
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.403
Yes.

33
00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.406
At the peak of their orgasm.

34
00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.841
And boy, oh boy,
did you make them pay.


35
00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:01.644
Reverend James Motley,

36
00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:04.081
you're on America's number
one radio talk show.


37
00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:05.514
Go ahead, Reverend.

38
00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:06.650
Miss Hills,

39
00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:08.851
me and my parishioners
question why,


40
00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:11.787
after all the horrible
things they did to you,


41
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.625
you let your body come again
in touch with those sinners.


42
00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:16.827
You mean, Reverend,

43
00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.563
why was I willing
to desecrate it?


44
00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:21.597
Voluntarily, that is.

45
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.600
Precisely.

46
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:24.768
As you
can imagine, Reverend,


47
00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.138
I did not have the physical
strength of my rapist.


48
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.840
We are
here with Jennifer Hills,


49
00:02:30.842 --> 00:02:32.942
discussing her
controversial book...


50
00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:35.645
Hello?

51
00:02:35.647 --> 00:02:37.449
Hey, Herman,
are you listening?


52
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.851
Do you hear me, Herman?

53
00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:42.386
Are you

54
00:02:42.388 --> 00:02:43.920
listening?!

55
00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:46.790
Listening.

56
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:47.794
Good!

57
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.927
The only
advantage at my disposal


58
00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.699
was by God's given weapon,

59
00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:54.964
my sexual appeal.

60
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.833
So I used it to
entice and trick them.


61
00:02:57.835 --> 00:02:59.001
To their demise?

62
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:00.737
Precisely.

63
00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.905
In other words,
you were willing to violate


64
00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.808
and to dehumanize yourself,

65
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.910
this time voluntarily,

66
00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:09.478
all in the name of vengeance?

67
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.815
Justice, Reverend.

68
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:12.752
Justice.

69
00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:38.708
Wouldn't you
rather see me in the flesh?


70
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.846
That was mean, kid-o.

71
00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:43.882
Hi, Mom.

72
00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:48.552
I thought I was
gonna die of starvation


73
00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:49.756
before you showed up.

74
00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:51.691
Sorry.

75
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.492
I was besieged with
fans after the show.


76
00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:58.828
Summer swimsuits, autographs,
couldn't let them down.


77
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.097
Okay, girl, I forgive you.

78
00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.201
So
what are we having?


79
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:05.635
Who's paying today?

80
00:04:05.637 --> 00:04:06.472
You are.

81
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.974
That's okay, I got
it for being late.


82
00:04:10.976 --> 00:04:13.510
In this case, I'm gonna have,

83
00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:15.681
let's see, the two
inch filet mignon,


84
00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:19.816
a lobster, a bowl of caviar

85
00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:22.985
and, oh yes, a
bottle of champaign.


86
00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:24.653
Buongiorno, Madame Hills.

87
00:04:24.655 --> 00:04:26.256
Buongiorno, Marcello

88
00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:27.926
Buongiorno,
Senorita Christina.


89
00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:31.027
What will we be having today?

90
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.263
A bowl of mixed garden salad,

91
00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:34.667
lots of garlic.

92
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.533
And for you, Christina?

93
00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.903
Just a glass of
sparkling water, please.


94
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.941
She's on a perpetual diet.

95
00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:48.044
You gotta eat, soon enough
you will vanish into thin air.


96
00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:49.812
Lots of garlic?

97
00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:51.047
Ew.

98
00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:52.148
Why, you know
somebody out their


99
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.251
that's waiting
anxiously to kiss me?


100
00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:56.920
No, Mom, actually I don't.

101
00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.058
You never have time for that.

102
00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:03.792
Let's face it, you run around
like a chicken without a head.


103
00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:07.934
Doing lectures, interviews,
counseling rape victims.


104
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.134
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's all really cool,


105
00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:14.239
but I kind wish you'd
just give it all up.


106
00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.908
You know, find yourself
a nice balding guy


107
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.975
who doesn't mind kissing you

108
00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:21.744
with that awful stench
of garlic on your breath.


109
00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:23.646
Settle down already, Mom.

110
00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:27.650
I've done pretty good with
you, babe, as a single mom,


111
00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:31.054
and I'm managing
very well, thank you,


112
00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:34.023
without a man, balding or hairy,

113
00:05:34.025 --> 00:05:38.097
telling me what to do with my
life and how to run my career.


114
00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:42.100
Thank you, Marcello.

115
00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.104
Bon app├ętit.

116
00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:47.939
Well.

117
00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:51.676
Well, what?

118
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.080
What is it that you
wanted to talk about?


119
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.152
Mom, it can't go on forever.

120
00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:03.787
What can't?

121
00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:04.987
My career.

122
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.122
I've been doing
it since I was 10.


123
00:06:07.124 --> 00:06:08.793
Getting a little tired of it.

124
00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:11.263
Eat.

125
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.301
You've been blessed, Christy.

126
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.970
You are the most famous
and highest paid model


127
00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:22.040
in the whole world.

128
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:26.309
Millions of girls out
there would do anything


129
00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:30.181
just to be, for one
day, in your shoes.


130
00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.650
So what is there to be tired of?

131
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:36.352
Tired of the
constant pressure.


132
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.953
Tired of flying.

133
00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:39.756
I'm tired of airplane food.

134
00:06:39.758 --> 00:06:41.658
Tired of sleeping everyday
in a different bed


135
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.929
in a different hotel.

136
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.795
I'm tired of posing in
front of the cameras


137
00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:49.232
and cat walking every
day on a different ramp


138
00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:52.738
and not even knowing what
city, or even country, I'm in.


139
00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:55.338
I'm tired of wondering
what the people


140
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.243
are really poking their eyes at.

141
00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.076
Is it the piece that I'm wearing

142
00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:01.881
or it is my ass and my tits?

143
00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:04.948
Let's face it, Mom,

144
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.682
I'm nothing but a
fucking walking mannequin


145
00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:08.251
being used to sell a product.

146
00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:09.989
Who gives a damn, Christy?

147
00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:13.722
You got the look
that sells magazines,


148
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.695
the body that sells clothes.

149
00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:19.097
That's why you're
being paid in gold.


150
00:07:21.032 --> 00:07:22.167
What else do you wish for?

151
00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:27.272
You must be very grateful for
everything you have, Christy.


152
00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:29.842
You never know in life.

153
00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:32.908
It can all suddenly change

154
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.944
before there's time
to appreciate it.


155
00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:38.216
Mom, come on, you know
that I appreciate it.


156
00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:40.151
It's just,

157
00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:43.285
it just doesn't mean
much to me anymore.


158
00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:46.222
You know, I wanna do
something that challenges me,


159
00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:48.027
uses my brains.

160
00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:52.761
And, unlike you, I'd like to
find a nice guy who loves me


161
00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:56.932
and I love too, settle down,
have kids, get married.


162
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.637
Four or five kids.

163
00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:00.973
Make you a grandma.

164
00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:02.974
Thanks, Christy.

165
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.012
You warm my heart.

166
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.812
You made me cry.

167
00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:10.649
Oh.

168
00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:14.316
You were only five
when you said to me,


169
00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:17.289
"Mommy, when I grow
up, can I be a model?"


170
00:08:18.989 --> 00:08:23.128
And I said, "Christy, you can
be anything you wanna be."


171
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.197
And I say that now.

172
00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:28.034
Besides,

173
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.770
modeling has a very
short shelf life.


174
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.803
Thanks, Mom.

175
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:36.806
Well now, I guess I
can tell you something


176
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.273
that I couldn't before.

177
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:39.111
Oh?

178
00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:45.281
I was offered half a
million to shave my head


179
00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:49.052
and pose for the cover of
a men's fashion magazine.


180
00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:50.320
And...

181
00:08:51.523 --> 00:08:54.427
Another half a million
if I do it topless.


182
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.228
Please don't tell me
what I think you said.


183
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.061
I did.

184
00:08:59.063 --> 00:09:00.162
You devil, you.

185
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.432
You turned it down.

186
00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:03.368
I'll be damned.

187
00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:06.302
Go tell them, for
a million bucks,


188
00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:10.907
I'll do it head shaven
and in the nude.


189
00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:12.341
Total nude.

190
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.449
You're so crazy, Mom.

191
00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:20.283
Christy?

192
00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:21.518
Miss Hills?

193
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.484
Could we
get your autographs?


194
00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:23.418
Sure.

195
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.354
We're really big fans.

196
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:25.821
I just bought your book today.

197
00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.489
Sure, I'd be glad to.

198
00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:28.892
Well that was nice,

199
00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:30.493
we got to meet in the
middle of the day.


200
00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:31.427
Yep.

201
00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:33.031
There they are, Scotty.

202
00:09:39.837 --> 00:09:41.403
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:09:41.405 --> 00:09:42.775
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:47.277
I can take a cab home.

205
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.313
Come on.

206
00:09:49.246 --> 00:09:51.247
I'll give you a ride home.

207
00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:52.282
If you tip me well.

208
00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.917
Oh, gosh.

209
00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:55.484
Always full of
jokes, aren't you?


210
00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:57.353
Oh yeah, I try.

211
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.454
Where'd you park?

212
00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:01.191
Excuse me, ma'am, excuse me.

213
00:10:01.193 --> 00:10:03.359
Aren't you Jennifer Hills?

214
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:04.927
The one and only.

215
00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:06.262
I'll be damned.

216
00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:08.063
See, Scotty, I told
you it was her.


217
00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.467
Here, here, hand it to me quick!

218
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.168
Look what we just got.

219
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.103
Oh.

220
00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:15.271
A copy of your new book.

221
00:10:15.273 --> 00:10:17.373
You think we could
get your autograph?


222
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.344
- Say please.
- Sure.


223
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.377
Please!

224
00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:22.478
Pretty please.

225
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.345
Gladly.

226
00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:25.614
Thank you so much.

227
00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:27.450
I can't believe this.

228
00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:31.354
Standing right next to
the famous Jennifer Hills.


229
00:10:31.356 --> 00:10:33.388
To who should
I make it out to?


230
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.557
I'm Kevin,

231
00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.959
that there's Scott.

232
00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:38.127
We drove three
straight hours, ma'am.


233
00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:39.494
It's an honor to meet you.

234
00:10:39.496 --> 00:10:40.299
Aw.

235
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:42.168
Okay.

236
00:10:46.404 --> 00:10:47.604
Hey! Hey!

237
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.105
Hey, what're you doing?!

238
00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.340
- You want our money?
- Bitch!


239
00:10:50.342 --> 00:10:52.008
Hey, stop it!

240
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.508
- Fuck you!
- Stop it!


241
00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:55.879
Help!

242
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.279
Help!

243
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:58.114
Christy!

244
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:58.947
Help!

245
00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:00.115
Christy!

246
00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:02.351
Shut the fuck up!

247
00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:03.588
Shut the fuck up!

248
00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:07.990
Christy!

249
00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:09.258
Son of a bitches!

250
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.393
Christy!

251
00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:11.230
Christy!

252
00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:16.265
You son of a bitch!

253
00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:17.466
Son of a bitch!

254
00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:19.101
Put a fucking
lid on her, Scotty!


255
00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:22.537
Come on!

256
00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:25.074
You're coming with us.

257
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.182
Shut your fucking face!

258
00:12:47.992 --> 00:12:49.491
What is she doing here?

259
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:50.994
She was with her.

260
00:12:50.996 --> 00:12:52.427
They came together
out of the rest...


261
00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:56.065
I just wanna know why the
fuck you had to drag her along?!


262
00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.533
We couldn't help it,
Becky, she was there.


263
00:12:58.535 --> 00:12:59.537
She's an eye witness.

264
00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:04.273
Her name is Christina
Hills, you assholes.


265
00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:05.575
She's that woman's daughter.

266
00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.679
Her hands are clean.

267
00:13:10.015 --> 00:13:10.616
Let's move it!

268
00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:16.220
Let's do it.

269
00:13:32.736 --> 00:13:34.039
Pleased to meet you.

270
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:53.589
I've seen you in loads
of ads and TV commercials


271
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:55.094
since you were much younger.

272
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.130
You used to smile then.

273
00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.607
And I've been watching you
lately on the runway too.


274
00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:13.479
You looking like a fucking
anorexic, sad walking mannequin.


275
00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:16.178
What did you expect, Becky?

276
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.346
All models starve themselves.

277
00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:20.316
They wanna look like toothpicks.

278
00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.717
Yeah, don't you know?

279
00:14:22.719 --> 00:14:24.419
Starving is a way of life

280
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:28.523
it'll fucking drive
all those smiles away.


281
00:14:28.525 --> 00:14:30.628
Why aren't you
fucking smiling no more?


282
00:14:32.097 --> 00:14:33.298
Getting tired of it all?

283
00:14:40.572 --> 00:14:43.438
I like your eyes.

284
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.511
You ain't got 'em from your
momma, that's for damn sure.


285
00:15:03.495 --> 00:15:05.563
Welcome back, Jennifer Hills.

286
00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:14.205
You ain't as fucking beautiful
as you think you are.


287
00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:16.140
You ain't!

288
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:39.629
You are getting mighty famous

289
00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:41.732
and filthy rich

290
00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:44.667
on account of my
husband's blood.


291
00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:46.601
And the innocent blood

292
00:15:46.603 --> 00:15:48.904
of my dear brother, Stanley!

293
00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:51.776
And my cousin, Andy.

294
00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:53.645
He was like a big brother to me

295
00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:55.847
and she, she slaughtered him.

296
00:15:56.847 --> 00:15:58.583
Johnny loved me and the kids.

297
00:16:00.184 --> 00:16:01.783
He was a good man.

298
00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:03.885
A church going man.

299
00:16:03.887 --> 00:16:06.288
Andy and Stanley
didn't go to church


300
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.356
but they was good men too.

301
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:09.358
Matthew did.

302
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.592
Mhmm, he went to church.

303
00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:12.294
Yeah but Matthew was a retard.

304
00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:13.796
He don't fucking count.

305
00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:15.200
Retards do count.

306
00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:24.142
Johnny was always
faithful to me


307
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.615
Until you, like a bitch in heat,

308
00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:32.517
came along and seduced him.

309
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:34.749
Oh Jesus.

310
00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:35.984
Oh God

311
00:16:35.986 --> 00:16:39.522
Oh God!

312
00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:43.629
It felt good to
butcher him, didn't it?


313
00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:47.763
I can imagine what a
thrilling fucking moment


314
00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:48.799
that was for you.

315
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.537
But the kick you got
from cutting off his dick


316
00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.641
was just the foreplay.

317
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:59.178
You got hotter

318
00:17:00.844 --> 00:17:01.478
and hotter

319
00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:07.753
as he was crying and screaming

320
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.922
and going into convulsions.

321
00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.226
Bleeding to death.

322
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.562
Oh God!

323
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:21.530
Oh shit!

324
00:17:21.532 --> 00:17:22.367
Oh shit!

325
00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:32.711
It aroused you more and more

326
00:17:34.778 --> 00:17:35.613
and more

327
00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:39.418
until you felt in
fucking seventh heaven.


328
00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:44.689
That's why you
killed him, isn't it?


329
00:17:46.658 --> 00:17:50.629
Watching him die made you cum.

330
00:17:54.332 --> 00:17:56.334
Life is a bamboozling journey.

331
00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.470
And we don't fucking know

332
00:18:00.304 --> 00:18:02.604
when in how we'll die.

333
00:18:02.606 --> 00:18:06.310
We can just wish it
won't be fucking painful


334
00:18:07.778 --> 00:18:11.349
as the horrible deaths you
inflicted on your victims.


335
00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:15.821
You

336
00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:19.655
made goddamn sure

337
00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:21.693
that each of them
died painfully.


338
00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:25.964
But the way you
let my husband die,


339
00:18:27.598 --> 00:18:31.900
their ain't no fucking way
more painful than that!


340
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.902
Like our Jesus!

341
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.705
Jesus on the cross!

342
00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:37.406
My husband didn't go
willingly to his death


343
00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:39.811
and he wasn't
fucking resurrected!


344
00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.950
I waited a whole
week to bury him.


345
00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:48.650
I didn't want him
to go into his grave


346
00:18:48.652 --> 00:18:50.621
without his goddamn dick!

347
00:18:52.023 --> 00:18:55.757
Tell me, what did
you do with it?


348
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:58.026
I bet she ate it.

349
00:18:58.028 --> 00:18:59.530
I bet she's a cannibal too.

350
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.629
But I say?

351
00:19:01.631 --> 00:19:04.100
I say she dumped it in the
river and the fishes ate it.


352
00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.470
You ain't nothing
but a murderer.


353
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.939
A glorified, sexually deranged

354
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.943
mass murderer.

355
00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:16.881
Stop it!

356
00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.083
Stop!

357
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:24.855
My mother is not a murderer.

358
00:19:26.858 --> 00:19:27.692
All right?

359
00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:32.331
And the jury released
her of all charges.


360
00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:37.832
Declared her innocent.

361
00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:38.833
Innocent!

362
00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:40.936
Innocent, my ass!

363
00:19:40.938 --> 00:19:42.838
It was a New York City jury.

364
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.806
They spit on us
small town hicks.


365
00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:48.444
How much more misery
does my mom have to endure


366
00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:49.879
from you people?

367
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:50.979
Endure?

368
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.848
What the fuck is endure?

369
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.885
Does this dumb bitch
speak in American?!


370
00:19:55.887 --> 00:19:58.853
I bet where she comes
from, the big city,


371
00:19:58.855 --> 00:20:00.791
it means "eat shit."

372
00:20:02.927 --> 00:20:04.859
What about all
the misery and shit


373
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:06.797
that your momma laid on me?

374
00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:11.602
Or maybe I ain't count.

375
00:20:14.805 --> 00:20:16.574
I was every inch the lady

376
00:20:20.878 --> 00:20:21.947
and look at me now.

377
00:20:24.081 --> 00:20:27.686
Your momma made a
hole in my heart.


378
00:20:41.498 --> 00:20:42.867
For plenty nights

379
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.437
I lay lonely

380
00:20:48.738 --> 00:20:51.509
and awake in my cold bed,

381
00:20:53.945 --> 00:20:55.013
just gazing

382
00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:00.618
at the empty space next to me.

383
00:21:03.754 --> 00:21:05.756
Remembering Johnny's body heat.

384
00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:09.727
And I'm crying.

385
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.168
Crying for me and
for our two children.


386
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.672
And all they'll miss.

387
00:21:21.973 --> 00:21:23.508
All they'll miss

388
00:21:24.976 --> 00:21:27.542
growing up without a daddy,

389
00:21:27.544 --> 00:21:29.978
just when the need him the most.

390
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.647
Daddy! Daddy!

391
00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:32.982
Hey!

392
00:21:32.984 --> 00:21:34.019
Yahoo!

393
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.052
Daddy, tell him
to give me back my dollar.


394
00:21:37.054 --> 00:21:38.521
He stole my dollar!

395
00:21:38.523 --> 00:21:40.956
I didn't, she's lying.

396
00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.494
And every day,

397
00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:45.463
every day,

398
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.531
I pray to God

399
00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:50.168
to give me the day,

400
00:21:53.004 --> 00:21:57.609
to give me the day when
you fall into my hands.


401
00:21:59.877 --> 00:22:02.981
So I can give you
a preview to hell


402
00:22:04.314 --> 00:22:06.485
until you beg me

403
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:08.919
to kill you.

404
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.158
This day is here now!

405
00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:15.858
Hallelujah!

406
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.692
Amen!

407
00:22:16.694 --> 00:22:17.529
Amen!

408
00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:19.598
Amen.

409
00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:39.747
Cut the bitch's feet loose.

410
00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:43.084
Time to start cutting,
you fucking bitches!


411
00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:44.119
I don't care what you do to me

412
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:45.853
but leave my daughter alone!

413
00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:46.854
Leave her alone.

414
00:22:46.856 --> 00:22:48.623
Oh boy, oh boy.

415
00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:50.127
Watch out, guys.

416
00:22:51.159 --> 00:22:52.194
The bitch is snarling.

417
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:54.196
Don't mess with her!

418
00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:55.697
Jesus.

419
00:22:55.699 --> 00:22:57.299
Only a woman could
scream that loud.


420
00:22:57.301 --> 00:23:00.936
Only a woman gets to
scream that loud, Scotty!


421
00:23:00.938 --> 00:23:03.138
Please just let my
mom go, all right?


422
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.040
She'll give you money,
if that's what you want.


423
00:23:05.042 --> 00:23:07.009
You can have whatever you want.

424
00:23:07.011 --> 00:23:08.276
Screw her money, missy.

425
00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:10.946
Don't you dare hurt my mom!

426
00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:12.180
Don't you dare!

427
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:13.852
What do you say, guys?

428
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:17.656
Shall we?

429
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.889
You guys are gonna
face kidnapping charges.


430
00:23:21.891 --> 00:23:24.828
You guys are going to jail
for life, I'm telling you.


431
00:23:25.963 --> 00:23:26.794
No!

432
00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:27.629
No!

433
00:23:27.631 --> 00:23:28.265
No! No!

434
00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:32.200
You and your fucking people

435
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:35.172
ain't got the power to
charge us with nothing.


436
00:23:36.172 --> 00:23:39.207
Only the Almighty
can judge us folks


437
00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.042
and He's on our side!

438
00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:43.145
It's in the bible.

439
00:23:43.147 --> 00:23:43.982
Read it!

440
00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:46.915
God's word!

441
00:23:46.917 --> 00:23:48.250
Take her back
to New York City.


442
00:23:48.252 --> 00:23:50.084
Let her bring over
the police, the FBI,


443
00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:52.053
the whole fucking
United States Army.


444
00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:54.055
We ain't scared of them none.

445
00:23:56.761 --> 00:23:59.227
Stop your fucking moving
and wiggling bullshit!


446
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.196
Let's go, bitch!

447
00:24:01.198 --> 00:24:01.996
Come on!

448
00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:02.997
Christy!

449
00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:03.834
Christy!

450
00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:07.237
Christy!

451
00:24:14.711 --> 00:24:15.811
Move, bitch!

452
00:24:15.813 --> 00:24:18.816
- No!
- You sit down!


453
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:27.092
Now you raise up!

454
00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:29.891
You can look

455
00:24:29.893 --> 00:24:33.063
at what the fuck you have done!

456
00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:36.264
This shit

457
00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:38.266
is for you!

458
00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:42.036
Matthew. Matthew!

459
00:24:42.038 --> 00:24:43.738
You dig what he's saying?

460
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.440
He says this is his son.

461
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:46.908
Matthew.

462
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.115
He may have
been a bit slow, but he-


463
00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:55.216
He says, "His son may have
been a bit slow in the head


464
00:24:55.218 --> 00:24:56.851
but he was decent boy."

465
00:24:56.853 --> 00:24:58.186
Decent boy!

466
00:24:58.188 --> 00:24:59.791
All them boys!

467
00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:04.763
Why?

468
00:25:06.096 --> 00:25:06.930
Why?

469
00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:08.996
Why?!

470
00:25:08.998 --> 00:25:10.398
You're wasting
your breath, Herman.


471
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.136
It's useless to
ask why, why, why.


472
00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:15.337
Useless!

473
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:17.071
I know why!

474
00:25:17.073 --> 00:25:22.080
Because you are a
sexually deranged


475
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:24.079
blood lusting

476
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:26.117
mass murdering freak!

477
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.085
That's why.

478
00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:37.024
Now bitch!

479
00:25:37.026 --> 00:25:38.392
Turn your fucking ass!

480
00:25:38.394 --> 00:25:40.995
Now you fucking dig, bitch!

481
00:25:40.997 --> 00:25:42.363
Dig deep, bitch!

482
00:25:42.365 --> 00:25:43.367
Deep!

483
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:51.273
Start digging, bitch!

484
00:25:51.275 --> 00:25:53.445
- Start digging!
- Okay! Okay!


485
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.277
You vented your rage.

486
00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:59.013
You've made your point!

487
00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:02.253
Now bring me my daughter
and let us go home!


488
00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:07.391
We both promise never to say
anything about this incident.


489
00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:10.027
I promise.

490
00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.494
I promise.

491
00:26:13.496 --> 00:26:15.933
Vented our rage?

492
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.935
Justice is what
we're raging for.


493
00:26:19.937 --> 00:26:22.303
We're freaking for justice!

494
00:26:22.305 --> 00:26:27.312
And the only just for
a killer bitch, like you,


495
00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:29.977
is a knife through your throat!

496
00:26:29.979 --> 00:26:32.848
A stab through the
evil fucking heart


497
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.248
and six feet

498
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.017
of crushing

499
00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:37.351
dirt!

500
00:26:37.353 --> 00:26:40.856
Bring my daughter back
to me and let us go home.


501
00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:43.292
I picked this piece for you

502
00:26:43.294 --> 00:26:45.860
because I want you to say
good-goddamn-bye to life


503
00:26:45.862 --> 00:26:49.298
and go into your internal
fucking life in hell


504
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.366
like you made my husband go.

505
00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:54.503
Slowly, bit by bit,

506
00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:56.373
to the sound of music.

507
00:26:57.507 --> 00:27:00.408
Now let me chop
this bitch open wide!


508
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.011
Let me chop this bitch wide!

509
00:27:03.013 --> 00:27:04.513
Fucking painfully!

510
00:27:04.515 --> 00:27:05.949
You cunt bitch!

511
00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:08.550
Cool it, Kevin!

512
00:27:10.854 --> 00:27:11.488
Die!

513
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.558
Now dig or I'm gonna let him!

514
00:27:26.469 --> 00:27:28.172
Dig, bitch, dig!

515
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:33.942
Let me slice this
bitch open, Becky!


516
00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:38.413
Let me fucking opening her
up and let her bleed, Becky!


517
00:27:38.415 --> 00:27:39.648
Come on!

518
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.283
Let me fucking get
in there, Becky!


519
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:44.285
Go, Kevin, rip her
fucking face off!


520
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.920
Make her ugly!

521
00:27:45.922 --> 00:27:48.058
Time to fix that
makeup, bitch!


522
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:49.891
Yah!

523
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:53.361
You bitch!

524
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:57.131
Bitch!

525
00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:57.965
Goddamn you!

526
00:27:57.967 --> 00:27:59.301
Kevin! Kevin!

527
00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:01.469
Now tell me,
where's my daughter?


528
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:04.308
Were is that scumbag
headed with my daughter?


529
00:28:06.377 --> 00:28:07.275
Tell me!

530
00:28:07.277 --> 00:28:08.609
Fuck you!

531
00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:10.279
You!

532
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:12.347
Stand up there and put that
noose around your neck.


533
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:13.180
You

534
00:28:13.182 --> 00:28:15.149
can't say that

535
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:16.318
to me,

536
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.119
fuck face!

537
00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:20.455
My gun says I can.

538
00:28:20.457 --> 00:28:22.123
Fuck!

539
00:28:22.125 --> 00:28:23.625
Jesus Christ, I don't know
where you daughter is.


540
00:28:23.627 --> 00:28:26.061
I swear to fucking
Christ I don't.


541
00:28:26.063 --> 00:28:27.495
I swear!

542
00:28:27.497 --> 00:28:30.365
Becky, tell her where
the fuck she's at.


543
00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:31.399
Tell her.

544
00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:32.600
Fucking tell her, Becky!

545
00:28:32.602 --> 00:28:34.171
I ain't telling her shit!

546
00:28:35.072 --> 00:28:37.305
Go ahead, shoot us!

547
00:28:37.307 --> 00:28:39.541
You, hippo, kick the stump.

548
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.413
Do it!

549
00:28:44.415 --> 00:28:45.450
Herman.

550
00:28:47.717 --> 00:28:50.452
It'll take a dozen bullets
to knock him real dead


551
00:28:50.454 --> 00:28:52.490
and you fucking ain't got 'em!

552
00:28:53.657 --> 00:28:56.090
Go ahead, pull the
trigger on 'em!


553
00:28:56.092 --> 00:28:57.426
Try it!

554
00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:09.071
You bunch of moron hicks.

555
00:29:09.073 --> 00:29:10.275
I'll be back for you.

556
00:29:11.475 --> 00:29:14.176
You ain't gonna go
far, Jennifer Hills.


557
00:29:14.178 --> 00:29:15.977
We're gonna catch up with you.

558
00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:16.613
Soon!

559
00:29:23.454 --> 00:29:27.926
And we ain't no bunch of
moron hicks, you old cunt!


560
00:29:29.092 --> 00:29:31.193
You think we ain't
no humans just cause


561
00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:34.495
we ain't no big
city folks like you!


562
00:29:34.497 --> 00:29:37.565
We fear God and we
pay our taxes too.


563
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:40.938
We are might proud
of who we are!


564
00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:43.975
Mighty proud!

565
00:29:47.544 --> 00:29:49.311
Hey, guys, wait for me.

566
00:29:49.313 --> 00:29:50.180
Wait for me!

567
00:30:10.734 --> 00:30:12.533
We wasted

568
00:30:12.535 --> 00:30:14.572
too

569
00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:16.504
much...

570
00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:19.140
We didn't wait too much
time with her, Herman.


571
00:30:19.142 --> 00:30:20.708
I coulda killed her
right then and there.


572
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.744
I wanted her to
run fucking scared.


573
00:30:23.746 --> 00:30:26.281
But why, Becky, why?!

574
00:30:26.283 --> 00:30:28.550
Ain't we going in
for the fast kill?


575
00:30:28.552 --> 00:30:30.252
No.

576
00:30:30.254 --> 00:30:32.991
We're playing fucking Tom
and Jerry games with her.


577
00:30:34.658 --> 00:30:36.660
Like she did with
my husband, Johnny.


578
00:30:39.563 --> 00:30:42.330
You go fox hunting,
don't you, Kevin?


579
00:30:42.332 --> 00:30:45.169
Then you fucking know that it
ain't the slay that matters.


580
00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:50.571
The thrill of a good kill
is gaged by how exciting


581
00:30:50.573 --> 00:30:51.740
the hunt is.

582
00:30:53.677 --> 00:30:55.444
Yeah!

583
00:30:55.446 --> 00:30:56.477
Come on, Herm.

584
00:31:26.442 --> 00:31:28.311
Sit still and shut up.

585
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:37.287
Mmm, Mmm what?

586
00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:41.555
Shut up or I'll smack
you on the kisser.


587
00:31:41.557 --> 00:31:42.459
Jeez!

588
00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:18.830
You're gonna
kill me, aren't you?


589
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:20.698
Oh shit.

590
00:32:22.265 --> 00:32:23.101
How?

591
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.635
How are you gonna do it?

592
00:32:27.537 --> 00:32:28.338
Where?

593
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.222
What are they gonna
do to my mother?


594
00:32:45.488 --> 00:32:46.323
Tell me!

595
00:32:52.862 --> 00:32:54.899
My mother is indestructible.

596
00:32:58.968 --> 00:33:00.603
She's gonna get away.

597
00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:05.309
You'll see.

598
00:33:10.246 --> 00:33:11.548
And she'll be after you

599
00:33:13.583 --> 00:33:14.651
and your friends too.

600
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.687
You know what my
mother's capable of doing


601
00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:21.324
when she gets mad.

602
00:33:23.526 --> 00:33:24.327
Hey.

603
00:33:25.528 --> 00:33:27.762
Hey, can you pull
over, I gotta go.


604
00:33:27.764 --> 00:33:29.296
Go where?

605
00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.965
Take a hard guess, dummy.

606
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:32.667
Holy shit.

607
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:33.767
I'll scream.

608
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:35.236
Go ahead.

609
00:33:35.238 --> 00:33:36.937
Scream.

610
00:33:36.939 --> 00:33:37.775
Fine.

611
00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:39.940
I'll go right here.

612
00:33:54.557 --> 00:33:56.526
Nobody fucking pees in my van.

613
00:34:02.265 --> 00:34:03.467
Don't try anything funny

614
00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.504
or I'll break your goddamn neck.

615
00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:25.020
Over there.

616
00:34:25.022 --> 00:34:25.957
In the bushes.

617
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.295
Hey.

618
00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:40.398
I ain't stupid.

619
00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:46.768
Mmmm.

620
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.006
You wanna have some fun before
we go back to New York City?


621
00:35:50.973 --> 00:35:51.808
Okay.

622
00:35:55.078 --> 00:35:55.913
Where are you?

623
00:35:58.848 --> 00:35:59.683
Come on out.

624
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.386
You think I've never seen
a naked woman before?


625
00:36:05.888 --> 00:36:07.357
I fucked a retard once.

626
00:36:11.594 --> 00:36:12.527
I get it.

627
00:36:12.529 --> 00:36:14.598
You wanna see me naked too.

628
00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:17.600
Okay.

629
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.018
Goddamn it!

630
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.554
Come back!

631
00:36:39.556 --> 00:36:43.394
I'm gonna get you for
this, you fucking bitch!


632
00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:06.214
Hey!

633
00:37:06.216 --> 00:37:07.949
Hey, come back here!

634
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:10.851
Hey!

635
00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:12.754
Hey, come back here!

636
00:37:12.756 --> 00:37:13.955
Hey!

637
00:37:13.957 --> 00:37:18.125
You and your mother
are both goddamn sluts!


638
00:37:18.127 --> 00:37:19.028
Goddamn it.

639
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:25.232
Becky's gonna chop my balls off!

640
00:38:23.993 --> 00:38:25.995
I'll get you my pretty

641
00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:29.830
and your little girl too!

642
00:39:34.063 --> 00:39:35.096
Please don't shoot!

643
00:39:35.098 --> 00:39:37.297
We ain't got no money!

644
00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:39.701
But you can take
our old Lucy, here.


645
00:39:39.703 --> 00:39:41.168
Old Lucy.

646
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.703
You got a phone?

647
00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:43.804
I need to call the police.

648
00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:47.141
No, we ain't got no use
for no phone no more, dear,


649
00:39:47.143 --> 00:39:49.710
because we ain't got nobody
left no more for us to call.


650
00:39:49.712 --> 00:39:53.313
And we ain't got nobody
left to call us either.


651
00:39:53.315 --> 00:39:55.083
Something gone wrong, dear?

652
00:39:55.085 --> 00:39:58.051
My daughter and
I were kidnapped


653
00:39:58.053 --> 00:40:02.123
by these weird, crazy people!

654
00:40:02.125 --> 00:40:03.227
I escaped!

655
00:40:04.928 --> 00:40:05.860
She didn't.

656
00:40:05.862 --> 00:40:07.965
She still being held hostage?

657
00:40:09.366 --> 00:40:13.637
I told you, Henry, we
shoulda stayed home today.


658
00:40:14.404 --> 00:40:16.940
It's the loony's day out.

659
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.676
Look, the moon, it's full.

660
00:40:21.678 --> 00:40:23.710
Like a big,
white wedding balloon.


661
00:40:24.848 --> 00:40:27.717
Please, my daughter
is in danger.


662
00:40:29.986 --> 00:40:30.821
Get in.

663
00:40:40.295 --> 00:40:41.098
Here.

664
00:40:42.232 --> 00:40:44.998
Take a swig, hon,
it'll calm your nerves.


665
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.102
Oh, forget it.

666
00:40:48.203 --> 00:40:50.073
Here's a man for you.

667
00:40:50.973 --> 00:40:54.909
First, his sex drive conks out,

668
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.411
then his hearing quit

669
00:40:57.413 --> 00:41:01.181
and finally, when his memory
kisses his ass goodbye,


670
00:41:01.183 --> 00:41:02.884
what do I end up with?

671
00:41:02.886 --> 00:41:05.221
A fucking vegetable.

672
00:41:06.156 --> 00:41:07.625
Right, Henry?

673
00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:10.160
What did you say, Millie?

674
00:41:12.194 --> 00:41:14.127
Vegetable, Henry!

675
00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:15.131
That's what you are.

676
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.302
I Like them vegetables.

677
00:41:20.303 --> 00:41:21.404
But no carrots.

678
00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:24.304
Can't chew on them carrots.

679
00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:28.042
I'm getting on in years too.

680
00:41:28.044 --> 00:41:30.246
I ain't fucked up like that.

681
00:41:32.047 --> 00:41:33.883
Can't chew on them carrots.

682
00:41:47.096 --> 00:41:47.897
Whoa!

683
00:41:48.897 --> 00:41:51.267
Wait a minute, stop her, Henry.

684
00:41:52.268 --> 00:41:55.239
I reckon I'm getting
fucked up in here too.


685
00:41:56.438 --> 00:42:00.076
This peaceful town
ain't got no police.


686
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.909
You wait here, dear.

687
00:42:02.911 --> 00:42:05.948
We're gonna get you the
sheriff in the next town.


688
00:42:07.283 --> 00:42:10.918
We're on our way there
anyway to buy a load of shit.


689
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.423
Horse shit, you know?

690
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.089
For the plants in our farm.

691
00:42:16.091 --> 00:42:18.828
Thanks but please hurry up.

692
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.466
Help will be coming
your way, dear.


693
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.165
Very soon.

694
00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:27.268
You be careful
with that thing, hon.


695
00:46:06.556 --> 00:46:08.089
Open the door!

696
00:46:08.091 --> 00:46:09.190
Please open the door!

697
00:46:09.192 --> 00:46:10.023
Open it!

698
00:46:17.466 --> 00:46:18.465
Let me in!

699
00:46:24.007 --> 00:46:26.109
Open the door, I beg you!

700
00:46:29.178 --> 00:46:31.411
Please let me in!

701
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:33.681
Open the goddamn door!

702
00:46:33.683 --> 00:46:34.547
Open it!

703
00:46:40.522 --> 00:46:42.191
You fucking bitch!

704
00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:45.493
Go ahead, cunt face!

705
00:46:45.495 --> 00:46:47.494
Beg me for mercy, beg!

706
00:46:47.496 --> 00:46:48.529
No!

707
00:46:48.531 --> 00:46:49.630
Beg!

708
00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:53.634
Or I will cut you slowly,
piece by fucking piece!


709
00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:56.373
I'm begging for
Christy, not for myself!


710
00:46:57.105 --> 00:46:58.475
I beg you as a mother,

711
00:46:59.542 --> 00:47:01.241
please spare her life, please.

712
00:47:02.444 --> 00:47:05.082
Keep on begging, cock sucker!

713
00:47:06.082 --> 00:47:08.250
Make Johnny smile in his grave!

714
00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:14.255
I spit on Johnny's grave!

715
00:47:20.062 --> 00:47:21.494
Here,

716
00:47:21.496 --> 00:47:23.734
take this from Johnny!

717
00:47:54.663 --> 00:47:57.266
Here, here!

718
00:47:57.799 --> 00:48:00.333
I bring you the head

719
00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:03.172
of Jennifer Hills!

720
00:48:44.279 --> 00:48:47.551
Ain't no man want
to fuck you no more!


721
00:48:48.484 --> 00:48:51.254
Not even Satan in Hell!

722
00:49:40.203 --> 00:49:40.837
Mother!

723
00:49:42.404 --> 00:49:43.239
Mom!

724
00:49:43.973 --> 00:49:45.906
Mother!

725
00:49:45.908 --> 00:49:47.676
Oh my God!

726
00:49:48.511 --> 00:49:50.647
Oh my God!

727
00:49:55.317 --> 00:49:56.785
Mother!

728
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:02.625
No!

729
00:50:03.893 --> 00:50:04.728
Help!

730
00:50:05.694 --> 00:50:07.631
Help, somebody, please!

731
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:10.934
Help!

732
00:50:19.442 --> 00:50:21.775
Help me, my mother,
she's been slaughtered!


733
00:50:24.013 --> 00:50:24.848
Mother!

734
00:50:54.643 --> 00:50:55.775
Let me in!

735
00:50:59.982 --> 00:51:01.250
Open the door!

736
00:51:21.303 --> 00:51:22.735
Stop!

737
00:51:22.737 --> 00:51:23.573
Stop!

738
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.375
Bring my mom back!

739
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.310
Bring her back!

740
00:51:29.312 --> 00:51:29.946
Stop!

741
00:51:36.085 --> 00:51:38.521
What're you gonna
do with her now?!


742
00:51:43.926 --> 00:51:44.728
Stop!

743
00:51:46.328 --> 00:51:46.929
Stop!

744
00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:50.496
Woo!

745
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:51.301
Woo!

746
00:51:56.839 --> 00:51:57.641
Woo!

747
00:53:03.739 --> 00:53:04.605
Shit!

748
00:53:09.879 --> 00:53:11.879
Shut your fucking mouth!

749
00:53:13.915 --> 00:53:15.551
Come on, Herman!

750
00:53:16.419 --> 00:53:18.451
She's all yours, big boy!

751
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:21.491
She's ready for you!

752
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.025
Stop your fucking moving!

753
00:53:26.027 --> 00:53:29.196
You ain't never done it with
one like her before, did you?


754
00:53:29.198 --> 00:53:32.935
She's gonna feel a lot better
than doing it with a pig.


755
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.768
She's ready for you Herman.

756
00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:38.841
You ain't never had
one like this before.


757
00:53:41.777 --> 00:53:43.012
You're gonna love it, Herman.

758
00:53:44.145 --> 00:53:46.813
I
don't know, Kevin.


759
00:53:46.815 --> 00:53:47.915
Come on, Herman.

760
00:53:50.652 --> 00:53:52.455
You're wasting out goddamn time!

761
00:53:54.623 --> 00:53:55.522
You,

762
00:53:55.524 --> 00:53:56.893
hold her for me now!

763
00:53:57.859 --> 00:54:00.159
And I'll show you how it's done!

764
00:54:00.161 --> 00:54:01.962
No!

765
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:07.935
Yahoo! Yeah, Herman!

766
00:54:19.949 --> 00:54:21.080
Yeah, get in there!

767
00:54:21.082 --> 00:54:22.949
Get in there, Herman!

768
00:54:22.951 --> 00:54:24.618
Get in there, Herman!

769
00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.252
Get in there, boy!

770
00:54:26.254 --> 00:54:28.221
You stop your fucking fighting!

771
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.891
Stop your fucking fighting!

772
00:54:47.042 --> 00:54:48.674
Shut your mouth!

773
00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:51.978
Shut your fucking mouth!

774
00:54:55.149 --> 00:54:57.085
Please, please don't.

775
00:54:58.786 --> 00:54:59.621
Please.

776
00:55:05.794 --> 00:55:08.730
What the fuck is the
matter with you, Herman?!


777
00:55:13.234 --> 00:55:14.967
Jesus Christ.

778
00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:17.871
I see, I see you're
fucking impotent!


779
00:55:17.873 --> 00:55:20.873
Just like your dead son,
Matthew, ain't you?!


780
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:21.710
Matthew?

781
00:55:22.844 --> 00:55:25.814
You, come here
and hold her for me.


782
00:55:26.848 --> 00:55:28.848
Have you gone completely
fucking nuts?!


783
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:29.683
Come on!

784
00:55:29.685 --> 00:55:31.018
This shit ain't fair!

785
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.920
This is my turn!

786
00:55:32.922 --> 00:55:35.556
You gotta hold her for me!

787
00:55:35.558 --> 00:55:36.592
Now come on!

788
00:55:38.727 --> 00:55:40.127
God

789
00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:42.531
forgive me!

790
00:55:43.065 --> 00:55:45.065
What the fuck for?!

791
00:55:45.067 --> 00:55:48.000
She is getting
what she deserves.


792
00:55:48.002 --> 00:55:50.938
This is payback time!

793
00:55:52.641 --> 00:55:54.141
For Christ sake,

794
00:55:54.143 --> 00:55:57.043
would you fucking
hold her for me now?!


795
00:55:59.214 --> 00:56:00.279
Do you see?

796
00:56:00.281 --> 00:56:02.049
Do you fucking see?!

797
00:56:02.051 --> 00:56:03.850
She's fucking walking away!

798
00:56:03.852 --> 00:56:05.051
Do you see?!

799
00:56:05.053 --> 00:56:06.652
Fuck you, Herman!

800
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:08.855
- Come here!
- No, no, no.


801
00:56:08.857 --> 00:56:10.991
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

802
00:56:13.895 --> 00:56:15.027
Come on.

803
00:56:16.765 --> 00:56:18.998
Come back, you come back.

804
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.902
Yeah, you do, yeah, you do.

805
00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:23.139
No!

806
00:56:25.107 --> 00:56:27.009
- No, no, no.
- Come here.


807
00:56:28.344 --> 00:56:29.743
Oh, yes.

808
00:56:29.745 --> 00:56:31.881
No, no, please, no.

809
00:56:33.082 --> 00:56:33.913
No.

810
00:56:33.915 --> 00:56:35.147
Yes.

811
00:56:35.149 --> 00:56:36.148
Yes.

812
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.636
Oh, fuck yes!

813
00:56:56.638 --> 00:56:59.639
Goddamn, you fucking whore.

814
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:03.210
Do you feel it?

815
00:57:03.212 --> 00:57:04.344
You feel it?

816
00:57:14.957 --> 00:57:16.125
Yes, yes, yes.

817
00:57:20.663 --> 00:57:22.228
A crooked heart

818
00:57:23.866 --> 00:57:24.830
shall

819
00:57:24.832 --> 00:57:26.068
depart from me.

820
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:31.841
Evil I will not know.

821
00:57:42.685 --> 00:57:45.254
Oh fuck. Fuck yeah!

822
00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.155
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:57:59.835 --> 00:58:01.670
Evil I will not know!

824
00:58:07.176 --> 00:58:10.712
You got no fucking idea what
you missed out on, Herman.


825
00:58:11.913 --> 00:58:15.781
God put her sweet
ass on this planet


826
00:58:15.783 --> 00:58:17.919
for us to enjoy!

827
00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:23.056
Just like he put those sweet
corns in your garden, Herman.


828
00:58:28.163 --> 00:58:29.132
Oh, fuck.

829
00:58:56.091 --> 00:58:58.227
Hey, sweet juice.

830
00:58:59.928 --> 00:59:00.730
Want some more?

831
00:59:30.292 --> 00:59:31.194
Where to, hon?

832
00:59:33.428 --> 00:59:36.163
There are wild
animals in this forest


833
00:59:36.165 --> 00:59:37.766
and the night is getting near.

834
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:41.136
It ain't safe in the dark.

835
00:59:45.406 --> 00:59:47.309
She got his eyes, don't she?

836
00:59:50.846 --> 00:59:52.011
Same nose

837
00:59:52.013 --> 00:59:54.147
and same freaking chin.

838
00:59:54.149 --> 00:59:56.183
I see the eyes.

839
00:59:56.185 --> 00:59:57.217
Mainly the eyes.

840
00:59:57.219 --> 00:59:59.351
Just let me go.

841
00:59:59.353 --> 01:00:00.188
Hey, Herman!

842
01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.522
Come here, big boy.

843
01:00:02.524 --> 01:00:07.226
See if you can see a little
bit of Matthew in this face.


844
01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:08.163
A bit of Matthew?

845
01:00:09.464 --> 01:00:10.833
Give me a break.

846
01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:41.063
What's the matter, dear?

847
01:00:42.297 --> 01:00:44.400
I ain't attractive
enough for ya?


848
01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:49.304
Or is it because I ain't belong
to the right kind of people?


849
01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:53.842
My fingernails are
dirty with grease


850
01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:56.909
and my skin smells of gasoline.

851
01:00:56.911 --> 01:00:58.580
I'm a working woman!

852
01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:04.020
I can't afford
Christina's Choice.


853
01:01:05.254 --> 01:01:06.255
Is that a crime?

854
01:01:13.395 --> 01:01:15.464
So don't play hard
to get with me.


855
01:01:17.933 --> 01:01:20.268
Miss world class supermodel,

856
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.239
I read the gossip columns

857
01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:26.609
and you ain't exactly
"Miss Holy Virgin."


858
01:01:28.277 --> 01:01:31.677
You've been banged away
by zillions of celebrities


859
01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:34.015
and billionaires males

860
01:01:34.415 --> 01:01:37.484
and females.

861
01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:42.091
All the way from New York
City to Timbuk-fucking-tu!


862
01:01:44.926 --> 01:01:45.861
All I wanna do

863
01:01:47.962 --> 01:01:49.931
is give you the taste of real

864
01:01:51.699 --> 01:01:55.203
affection.

865
01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:15.255
Try that again, I'm gonna
make ya beg me to kill ya!


866
01:02:15.257 --> 01:02:18.391
Well, well, well,
lookie who's here.


867
01:02:18.393 --> 01:02:22.728
Oh, I can't wait to hear
how she out-foxed ya, Scotty.


868
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:23.663
What did she do?

869
01:02:23.665 --> 01:02:26.098
Let you get a peek at her boobs?

870
01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:29.502
Okay, Scotty, move
that dumb ass!


871
01:02:29.504 --> 01:02:30.940
Hold her feet for me.

872
01:02:31.605 --> 01:02:32.471
Blasph...

873
01:02:32.473 --> 01:02:33.308
What, Herman?

874
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.507
Blasph!

875
01:02:35.509 --> 01:02:37.212
Blasph what, damn it?

876
01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:40.346
What the fuck is
he howling about?


877
01:02:40.348 --> 01:02:41.714
Shut the fuck up, Herman!

878
01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.451
You had your chance and
you fucking blew it!


879
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.487
Blasph!

880
01:02:48.489 --> 01:02:52.424
Okay, okay, whatever
the fuck you say, Herman.


881
01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:55.561
Come on, you, don't just sit
there like a drooping prick.


882
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.069
Let her scream and
give me a kick.


883
01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:03.469
Please, don't.

884
01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:05.505
Promise to be a good girl?

885
01:03:05.507 --> 01:03:06.642
Please, don't.

886
01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.210
Your muscles are
mighty tight, honey.


887
01:03:11.212 --> 01:03:14.413
You gotta learn to
relax and enjoy it.


888
01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:15.781
Surrender, honey.

889
01:03:15.783 --> 01:03:16.685
Surrender.

890
01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:22.688
I'm gonna transport
you to paradise


891
01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:25.025
like no man you've
ever made it with.


892
01:03:26.395 --> 01:03:27.426
Stop!

893
01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:28.263
Stop!

894
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.596
Stop it!

895
01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:31.433
Stop!

896
01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:33.435
Please, stop!

897
01:03:38.739 --> 01:03:40.176
Blasphemy!

898
01:04:01.429 --> 01:04:05.065
What the
fuck is he doing?!


899
01:04:05.067 --> 01:04:06.302
What the fuck?!

900
01:04:08.402 --> 01:04:10.436
Bring her back, Herman!

901
01:04:10.438 --> 01:04:11.272
Now!

902
01:04:22.216 --> 01:04:23.750
Why'd you let her go?

903
01:04:23.752 --> 01:04:24.587
Why?

904
01:04:26.353 --> 01:04:27.754
Did you fucking ask him why

905
01:04:27.756 --> 01:04:30.623
he had to hit so goddamn hard?!

906
01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:33.493
You don't Fucking slug
your friend, you dumb fuck!


907
01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:35.494
Whose fucking side are
you, Herman?! Whose?


908
01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:39.667
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!


909
01:04:40.402 --> 01:04:41.237
Oink, oink, oink, oink!

910
01:04:42.437 --> 01:04:44.339
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!


911
01:04:49.444 --> 01:04:53.681
Oink, oink, oink, oink!

912
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:57.683
I ain't no pig!

913
01:04:57.685 --> 01:04:59.118
Whoa.

914
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.719
And you can't talk to me

915
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:03.558
like no cock-a-doodle chicken!

916
01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.229
I'm a human being!

917
01:05:08.596 --> 01:05:10.698
I got f-f-f-f-feelings!

918
01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:14.234
Hear that, boys?

919
01:05:14.236 --> 01:05:15.638
The man can talk.

920
01:05:17.538 --> 01:05:19.705
Congratulations, Herman.

921
01:05:20.908 --> 01:05:24.546
Maybe we gotta bash you on
the head like that more often!


922
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:29.248
Fucking cry baby,
cry baby, cry baby!


923
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.183
Cool it, Kevin.

924
01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:32.721
Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby!

925
01:05:34.656 --> 01:05:36.188
Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby!

926
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.625
Cool it, Kevin!

927
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.467
Man's in shock.

928
01:05:47.469 --> 01:05:48.571
Can suddenly fucking talk?

929
01:05:52.641 --> 01:05:53.843
Come here, Herman.

930
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.545
Come on.

931
01:06:08.957 --> 01:06:10.426
My big little baby.

932
01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:18.797
Blasphemy!

933
01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:20.465
Blasphemy!

934
01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:22.668
Don't you give me them
big shit holy bible words!


935
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:25.237
I ain't seen you in
church lately, have I?!


936
01:06:25.239 --> 01:06:28.708
Sometimes you act just
like a real jackass!


937
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.610
Like you're missing
a few screws up here!


938
01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:34.714
I can't believe he
fucking let her go!


939
01:06:34.716 --> 01:06:35.750
What are we gonna do?!

940
01:06:36.685 --> 01:06:37.620
Shut up, Kevin!

941
01:06:38.821 --> 01:06:41.824
You're goddamn doing too much
worrying for a guy your age!


942
01:06:43.424 --> 01:06:45.525
This ain't New York City.

943
01:06:45.527 --> 01:06:47.694
She'll be running up
blind alleys around here,


944
01:06:47.696 --> 01:06:49.297
even in broad daylight.

945
01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:53.565
Besides, as I said,

946
01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:56.835
the hunt is more exciting
than the kill, ain't it?


947
01:06:56.837 --> 01:06:57.672
Yes!

948
01:06:58.672 --> 01:06:59.705
Hey!

949
01:06:59.707 --> 01:07:01.674
First thing tomorrow,

950
01:07:01.676 --> 01:07:04.777
you are gonna go
hunting for her for me!


951
01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:06.946
You're gonna bring her
back to me, dead or alive,


952
01:07:06.948 --> 01:07:08.683
I do not give a shit!

953
01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:12.784
Or you ain't gonna show your
fat ass around us no more!


954
01:07:12.786 --> 01:07:13.688
Got me?!

955
01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:20.728
And for God sake,
zip up your fly!


956
01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:08.808
You blew
it for me and Becky!


957
01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.808
You blew it!

958
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.810
We coulda had a good time!

959
01:08:11.812 --> 01:08:13.379
A good time!

960
01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:14.647
Yeah, Herman!

961
01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:16.318
Why'd you have to
hit so damn hard?!


962
01:08:16.984 --> 01:08:17.952
We ain't no match for you!

963
01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:19.721
You big dumbfuck, Godzilla!

964
01:08:22.956 --> 01:08:25.892
Okay, okay,
guys, keep it down!


965
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.830
We got fucking things to do!

966
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:36.335
Nighty-night and sweet
dreams to you, little missy,


967
01:08:36.337 --> 01:08:37.770
wherever you are!

968
01:11:11.024 --> 01:11:12.560
Here she is, Johnny.

969
01:11:14.194 --> 01:11:15.997
Sealed and delivered,

970
01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:18.634
like I promised.

971
01:11:20.134 --> 01:11:21.937
But now that it's all over,

972
01:11:24.005 --> 01:11:26.007
there is something
I gotta tell you.


973
01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:30.946
It may wound you but

974
01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:36.083
if I hold it in any longer,

975
01:11:37.652 --> 01:11:38.653
I'll blow out my teeth.

976
01:11:41.523 --> 01:11:44.460
I reckon it was Satan who
sent her to seduce you


977
01:11:46.894 --> 01:11:48.895
and I know how mighty hard it is

978
01:11:48.897 --> 01:11:52.033
to stand up to its
temptations but,


979
01:11:55.036 --> 01:11:58.140
still and all,
the good book says


980
01:11:59.974 --> 01:12:02.511
"thou shall not
commit adultery."


981
01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.150
You hurt me, Johnny.

982
01:12:12.053 --> 01:12:13.855
You hurt me real good.

983
01:12:19.027 --> 01:12:22.962
Didn't I always perform
my wifely duties to you?


984
01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:25.664
Didn't I?

985
01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:27.236
And I still do, Johnny.

986
01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:30.205
I still do.

987
01:12:32.639 --> 01:12:34.639
Since you was gone,

988
01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:36.609
I've worked my ass
off at the station


989
01:12:36.611 --> 01:12:38.777
to make some decent dough

990
01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:42.149
so that Johnny Jr. and
Melissa can eat well


991
01:12:43.117 --> 01:12:46.654
and dress well and
get through college.


992
01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.127
Because you told me
when they was little,


993
01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:56.329
you said you wished
they wouldn't


994
01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:58.766
have to pump gas for a living.

995
01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:02.037
Here.

996
01:13:04.605 --> 01:13:05.607
Look at em'.

997
01:13:07.809 --> 01:13:09.278
You oughta be proud, Johnny.

998
01:13:11.746 --> 01:13:12.681
Mighty proud.

999
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.157
They've grown up to become
decent and respectable folks.


1000
01:13:27.161 --> 01:13:28.663
They live in the big city now.

1001
01:13:30.098 --> 01:13:30.933
New York.

1002
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.135
Far from me.

1003
01:13:36.938 --> 01:13:38.340
But I reckon they like it there.

1004
01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:46.044
They're gonna be riding
out here tomorrow


1005
01:13:46.046 --> 01:13:48.215
to celebrate Easter
with their ma.


1006
01:13:58.158 --> 01:14:00.761
But our joy won't
be complete, Johnny.


1007
01:14:02.095 --> 01:14:03.130
It won't.

1008
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.706
Because you won't be here
to celebrate with us.


1009
01:14:19.013 --> 01:14:20.015
Hey, guys.

1010
01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:23.919
So good to see you boys.

1011
01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:29.224
You gotta be mighty
pleased with us.


1012
01:14:31.925 --> 01:14:34.196
We finally got that evil bitch!

1013
01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:38.329
We evened the score for you.

1014
01:14:38.331 --> 01:14:39.867
For all of you!

1015
01:14:41.035 --> 01:14:43.971
And we're gonna get
even with Satan too.


1016
01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:45.771
Goddamn right!

1017
01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:48.007
We're gonna destroy her child!

1018
01:14:48.009 --> 01:14:49.275
Goddamn right!

1019
01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:51.377
The fruit of his
evil temptations!


1020
01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:52.445
Goddamn right!

1021
01:14:52.447 --> 01:14:53.281
Do it!

1022
01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.161
Put it in.

1023
01:27:17.657 --> 01:27:18.492
Why me?

1024
01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:21.863
Because.

1025
01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:29.002
You forgive me, don't you?

1026
01:29:59.318 --> 01:30:02.320
Most beautiful day,
ain't it now, Becky?


1027
01:30:02.322 --> 01:30:05.056
Ha, beautiful, my ass.

1028
01:30:05.058 --> 01:30:07.691
Why the hell ain't you
out there looking for her?


1029
01:30:07.693 --> 01:30:10.094
We was already looking
but Scotty, here,


1030
01:30:10.096 --> 01:30:12.265
felt like stopping
by your place first.


1031
01:30:14.033 --> 01:30:18.305
And guess what he's
got for you now.


1032
01:30:25.412 --> 01:30:27.277
Johnny used to
bring me fresh flowers


1033
01:30:27.279 --> 01:30:29.951
every Sunday morning
before church.


1034
01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:32.219
We know.

1035
01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.725
You're forgiven.

1036
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:45.230
Look at you, you're blushing
like a little school girl.


1037
01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:47.132
You little sweet little cupcake.

1038
01:30:47.134 --> 01:30:50.834
Has the ink got
into your brain, punk?


1039
01:30:50.836 --> 01:30:51.705
Be nice to him.

1040
01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:58.977
Shit.

1041
01:30:58.979 --> 01:30:59.780
Go, Kevin.

1042
01:31:01.047 --> 01:31:01.881
Carnation.

1043
01:31:03.183 --> 01:31:04.214
And?

1044
01:31:04.216 --> 01:31:05.385
Pom pom daisy.

1045
01:31:06.353 --> 01:31:07.388
Button daisy.

1046
01:31:09.156 --> 01:31:10.190
Mini carnation.

1047
01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:13.894
Statice, that's
the forever flower.


1048
01:31:15.327 --> 01:31:17.197
And that's our lemon leaf.

1049
01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.104
Pretty fucking good for
a public school dropout.


1050
01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:28.205
Have you seen Herman?

1051
01:31:28.207 --> 01:31:29.242
No.

1052
01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:32.013
Oh yes, I must've
hurt his feelings.


1053
01:31:33.212 --> 01:31:36.047
And he doesn't goddamn answer
his phone, the dumb fuck.


1054
01:31:36.049 --> 01:31:38.115
It's because he probably
can't hear the rings, Becky.


1055
01:31:38.117 --> 01:31:39.817
Or maybe he ain't home

1056
01:31:39.819 --> 01:31:42.187
because he's already
out looking for her.


1057
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:44.489
Man's getting senile, we
can't count on him no more.


1058
01:31:44.491 --> 01:31:46.227
The man was born senile.

1059
01:31:48.761 --> 01:31:50.096
Watch your mouth, Scotty.

1060
01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:54.365
Herman put up that farm
and made it what it is


1061
01:31:54.367 --> 01:31:56.101
with his bare hands.

1062
01:31:56.103 --> 01:31:58.205
What have you done
lately with your life?


1063
01:32:05.245 --> 01:32:06.910
Early this morning,
somebody snatched clothes


1064
01:32:06.912 --> 01:32:08.213
out of Wilma's backyard.

1065
01:32:08.215 --> 01:32:09.246
It wasn't me.

1066
01:32:09.248 --> 01:32:10.181
Me neither.

1067
01:32:10.183 --> 01:32:11.415
Who is blaming you, dummies?!

1068
01:32:11.417 --> 01:32:13.151
Maybe it was her!

1069
01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.219
It could be one of them
drifters passing through.


1070
01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:16.987
Oh it could, my ass.

1071
01:32:16.989 --> 01:32:18.757
Next thing you know, she'll
be sneaking out of here


1072
01:32:18.759 --> 01:32:20.461
right under our
noses and then what?


1073
01:32:22.528 --> 01:32:25.329
Get her for me, dead or alive.

1074
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:27.200
Start with the woods
along the creek.


1075
01:32:30.269 --> 01:32:32.372
Well get moving, I got
a business to run here!


1076
01:33:17.283 --> 01:33:19.950
Fucking big place,

1077
01:33:19.952 --> 01:33:22.122
New York City is.

1078
01:33:24.424 --> 01:33:28.129
I caught sight of it for
the first time in my life.


1079
01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:32.199
It's fucking huge.

1080
01:33:35.202 --> 01:33:36.334
Yeah.

1081
01:33:36.336 --> 01:33:40.838
One day I'm gonna ditch this
crummy, fucking hick town


1082
01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.308
and go to New York

1083
01:33:44.376 --> 01:33:47.878
because that's where
all the action is, man.


1084
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.215
The real action.

1085
01:33:50.483 --> 01:33:52.419
What're you gonna do, huh?

1086
01:33:53.385 --> 01:33:54.919
You don't know nobody there.

1087
01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.355
That shit don't matter, see?

1088
01:33:57.357 --> 01:34:00.357
Because nobody fucking
knows each other there.


1089
01:34:00.359 --> 01:34:02.295
Not even the folks
that was born there.


1090
01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:07.531
But that's what I like about it.

1091
01:34:07.533 --> 01:34:10.970
You still got a
chance to be somebody.


1092
01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.905
Yeah.

1093
01:34:14.907 --> 01:34:16.540
One day, I'm gonna
go to New York


1094
01:34:16.542 --> 01:34:19.343
and I'm gonna be somebody

1095
01:34:19.345 --> 01:34:22.282
and everybody's gonna
wanna get to know me.


1096
01:34:23.382 --> 01:34:26.950
And I'm gonna get
to know everybody.


1097
01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:28.522
Everybody that counts, that is.

1098
01:34:29.656 --> 01:34:32.259
You mean, like, folks
with lots of money?


1099
01:34:33.193 --> 01:34:34.225
Beautiful women?

1100
01:34:34.227 --> 01:34:35.194
Fucking
-A right, Scotty!

1101
01:34:36.962 --> 01:34:40.367
All those toothpick
skinny model bitches too.


1102
01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:42.502
I'm gonna fuck 'em all.

1103
01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:47.440
Put back a smile on
those sad, little faces.


1104
01:34:50.376 --> 01:34:53.446
Hey, Kevin, can I
go there with you?


1105
01:34:54.413 --> 01:34:57.318
Sure, Scotty,
sure, yeah, yeah.


1106
01:34:59.452 --> 01:35:01.488
If you wanna be somebody.

1107
01:35:02.488 --> 01:35:04.187
Yeah.

1108
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:08.927
On second thought, you ain't
got no business being there.


1109
01:35:08.929 --> 01:35:11.396
Unless you plan on
scrubbing out toilets


1110
01:35:11.398 --> 01:35:13.530
in those big,
beautiful skyscrapers


1111
01:35:13.532 --> 01:35:16.202
for the rest of
your pitiful life.


1112
01:35:17.604 --> 01:35:19.036
Why'd you say that?

1113
01:35:19.038 --> 01:35:21.105
Because you got
no fucking idea


1114
01:35:21.107 --> 01:35:24.144
about what you wanna
do or who you wanna be.


1115
01:35:25.345 --> 01:35:30.248
Yeah, you best just stay
here in this shit dump town.


1116
01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:32.286
It's a perfect
fucking place for you.


1117
01:35:33.486 --> 01:35:36.353
Cause you got that
typical hillbilly,


1118
01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:39.423
fucking redneck mentality.

1119
01:35:39.425 --> 01:35:43.428
See, you were born here and
you're gonna fucking die here.


1120
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.628
And when you do die here,

1121
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:46.432
you know who's gonna care?

1122
01:35:48.068 --> 01:35:49.299
Nobody!

1123
01:35:49.301 --> 01:35:51.535
Nobody's gonna even give a shit

1124
01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:55.375
- that you existed!
- You don't mean that, Kevin!


1125
01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:57.978
You're only kidding, right?

1126
01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:00.978
We're gonna go together because,

1127
01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.612
well, because we're
best friends, ain't we?


1128
01:36:02.614 --> 01:36:04.147
We're friends.

1129
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:05.286
Best friends.

1130
01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:07.086
Yeah.

1131
01:36:08.621 --> 01:36:09.255
Hmmmm.

1132
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:13.559
I know what we could do there.

1133
01:36:15.295 --> 01:36:19.399
We could open up a flower shop.

1134
01:36:20.632 --> 01:36:22.366
Yeah.

1135
01:36:22.368 --> 01:36:26.139
You'll manage the shop and
I'll deliver the flowers.


1136
01:36:28.507 --> 01:36:29.510
I could throw in my van.

1137
01:36:30.676 --> 01:36:32.446
Cost me three grand, you know?

1138
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.413
I do love the van.

1139
01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.583
I do love your van.

1140
01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:40.084
Let me think about it.

1141
01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:41.552
I will think about it.

1142
01:36:41.554 --> 01:36:42.687
Okay.

1143
01:36:42.689 --> 01:36:43.620
All right.

1144
01:36:45.425 --> 01:36:47.290
Holy fuck, man!

1145
01:36:47.292 --> 01:36:48.328
Herman's car!

1146
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:52.562
Hey!

1147
01:36:52.564 --> 01:36:53.731
Herman!

1148
01:36:53.733 --> 01:36:55.700
Over here!

1149
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:59.536
I bet the dumb fuck
is trying to give us


1150
01:36:59.538 --> 01:37:01.705
some kind of signal
or something.


1151
01:37:01.707 --> 01:37:02.542
Yeah.

1152
01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:06.980
Let me go see what this butt-fuck
buffoon's up to, alright.


1153
01:37:08.514 --> 01:37:10.447
Still fucking hurts, you know?

1154
01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:13.383
I ain't talking to him until
he begs me to forgive him.


1155
01:37:13.385 --> 01:37:14.485
Fucking
-A, right!

1156
01:37:14.487 --> 01:37:16.087
My ball's turned blue.

1157
01:37:16.089 --> 01:37:17.521
I swear to Christ he
fucking cracked them.


1158
01:37:17.523 --> 01:37:20.090
Good, then we
can make an omelet!


1159
01:37:20.092 --> 01:37:21.625
I like mine sunny side up.

1160
01:37:22.495 --> 01:37:23.527
It ain't funny!

1161
01:37:23.529 --> 01:37:25.396
It ain't funny!

1162
01:37:25.398 --> 01:37:26.233
All right.

1163
01:37:38.243 --> 01:37:40.645
Where's you big ass at, boy?

1164
01:37:46.586 --> 01:37:47.488
Hey, Herman!

1165
01:37:49.154 --> 01:37:50.224
Come on out!

1166
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:53.594
We ain't mad at you
now more, big boy!


1167
01:37:54.626 --> 01:37:55.726
Come on!

1168
01:37:55.728 --> 01:37:58.529
Don't be scared!

1169
01:37:58.531 --> 01:37:59.699
All is forgiven, Herman!

1170
01:38:01.867 --> 01:38:02.799
Fucking idiot.

1171
01:38:12.278 --> 01:38:13.113
Herman!

1172
01:38:15.314 --> 01:38:17.815
Quit fucking playing games!

1173
01:38:17.817 --> 01:38:20.584
Bring your ass out here, boy!

1174
01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:29.563
Herman!

1175
01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:32.565
Herman is dead.

1176
01:38:42.641 --> 01:38:44.307
Hey, Scotty!

1177
01:38:44.309 --> 01:38:45.211
Guess what!

1178
01:38:46.578 --> 01:38:49.246
Yo, Kevin, is he there?

1179
01:38:49.248 --> 01:38:50.250
No, man, he ain't!

1180
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:54.420
But guess who the fuck is.

1181
01:38:57.523 --> 01:38:58.357
Who?

1182
01:39:01.661 --> 01:39:02.830
Come on, Kevin, who?

1183
01:39:05.264 --> 01:39:06.299
Tell him.

1184
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:10.203
Well, come on, man!

1185
01:39:11.638 --> 01:39:12.473
Tell him.

1186
01:39:13.706 --> 01:39:14.741
It's her!

1187
01:39:16.242 --> 01:39:17.174
She's here!

1188
01:39:17.176 --> 01:39:19.276
Yeah, what's she doing?

1189
01:39:19.278 --> 01:39:21.279
She's pointing
a gun at my face!


1190
01:39:21.281 --> 01:39:23.513
Come on, Kevin,
you ain't foolin' me!


1191
01:39:23.515 --> 01:39:25.583
Now put it down.

1192
01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:27.688
Slowly.

1193
01:39:37.697 --> 01:39:38.699
Get down.

1194
01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:43.234
Now strip.

1195
01:39:43.236 --> 01:39:44.138
What'd you say?

1196
01:39:45.305 --> 01:39:46.904
Could you say that
a little bit louder?


1197
01:39:46.906 --> 01:39:47.972
Come on.

1198
01:39:47.974 --> 01:39:48.809
I can't.

1199
01:39:49.975 --> 01:39:51.612
But my gun can.

1200
01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:58.682
Much

1201
01:39:58.684 --> 01:39:59.749
louder.

1202
01:39:59.751 --> 01:40:01.352
Okay, okay.

1203
01:40:01.354 --> 01:40:02.723
You ain't gonna kill me, right?

1204
01:40:04.724 --> 01:40:05.792
Your boots.

1205
01:40:07.926 --> 01:40:08.993
Please.

1206
01:40:08.995 --> 01:40:10.628
Please, don't kill me.

1207
01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:11.931
Please don't fucking shoot me.

1208
01:40:12.898 --> 01:40:14.699
It was Scotty,

1209
01:40:14.701 --> 01:40:16.803
that sick fucking
jerk over there.


1210
01:40:19.272 --> 01:40:21.472
Ever since he laid
his eyes on you,


1211
01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:24.211
all he could think about
was getting into your pants.


1212
01:40:25.845 --> 01:40:28.949
It was his fucking idea to
rape you in the beginning!


1213
01:40:31.884 --> 01:40:33.353
The shorts.

1214
01:40:35.255 --> 01:40:37.021
Please don't kill me.

1215
01:40:37.023 --> 01:40:38.659
You're not gonna
shoot me, right?


1216
01:40:40.827 --> 01:40:41.795
You're not the type.

1217
01:40:42.729 --> 01:40:43.995
You're not cruel.

1218
01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:46.763
You won't carry out a
cold-blooded murder.


1219
01:40:46.765 --> 01:40:47.768
Not like your mother.

1220
01:40:49.469 --> 01:40:50.700
Right?

1221
01:40:50.702 --> 01:40:52.572
You don't have that
cruelness in your heart.


1222
01:40:55.942 --> 01:40:57.741
Please, please.

1223
01:40:57.743 --> 01:40:59.877
I'm so fucking sorry

1224
01:40:59.879 --> 01:41:02.280
for what we did to your mother

1225
01:41:02.282 --> 01:41:04.447
and for what I've done to you.

1226
01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:08.819
I never wanted to get mixed
up in this goddamn thing


1227
01:41:08.821 --> 01:41:09.823
from the beginning.

1228
01:41:11.724 --> 01:41:14.758
But I was fucking
forced to by Becky!


1229
01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.294
As soon as she lost her husband,

1230
01:41:17.296 --> 01:41:19.429
she went completely
fucking insane!


1231
01:41:19.431 --> 01:41:20.897
Insane!

1232
01:41:35.415 --> 01:41:36.550
Please, forgive me.

1233
01:41:37.684 --> 01:41:38.719
I'm repenting to you.

1234
01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:44.357
I beg of you.

1235
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:46.460
I'm not evil.

1236
01:41:47.794 --> 01:41:48.758
I'm fucked up.

1237
01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.763
Please.

1238
01:41:51.397 --> 01:41:52.832
Don't cry, okay?

1239
01:42:08.781 --> 01:42:09.815
Statice?

1240
01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:12.318
A forever flower.

1241
01:42:15.421 --> 01:42:16.690
It's for you.

1242
01:42:17.857 --> 01:42:18.989
For me?

1243
01:42:18.991 --> 01:42:19.824
For you.

1244
01:42:19.826 --> 01:42:20.794
How did you know?

1245
01:42:24.464 --> 01:42:27.097
I know the name of
every single blossom


1246
01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:29.533
in this whole forest.

1247
01:42:29.535 --> 01:42:31.904
Every tree, every
plant, all of them.


1248
01:42:33.038 --> 01:42:34.608
I'm gonna go back to school

1249
01:42:35.707 --> 01:42:37.441
and study botany.

1250
01:42:37.443 --> 01:42:39.877
It's the whole science

1251
01:42:39.879 --> 01:42:41.782
of all these beautiful
plants and flowers.


1252
01:42:46.853 --> 01:42:49.690
I knew it. You're
the romantic type.


1253
01:42:53.626 --> 01:42:55.929
You don't belong
with those monsters.


1254
01:42:56.796 --> 01:42:57.727
No.

1255
01:42:57.729 --> 01:42:58.695
No.

1256
01:42:58.697 --> 01:43:00.798
I don't, I'm not a monster.

1257
01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.702
I'm not like them.

1258
01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:05.938
They're just a bunch
of fucked up, inbred.


1259
01:43:06.839 --> 01:43:09.839
They're just fucking bumpkins.

1260
01:43:09.841 --> 01:43:12.877
I was born here but I'm
not fucking like them.


1261
01:43:12.879 --> 01:43:13.846
I'm not.

1262
01:43:15.915 --> 01:43:20.785
And this whole goddamn
hateful revenge thing,


1263
01:43:20.787 --> 01:43:21.951
it never fucking ends!

1264
01:43:21.953 --> 01:43:23.820
There's no end to it!

1265
01:43:23.822 --> 01:43:24.657
Yeah.

1266
01:43:26.992 --> 01:43:27.924
Yeah.

1267
01:43:27.926 --> 01:43:32.128
And that is why our good Lord,

1268
01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:37.136
he commands us to
forgive the unforgivable.


1269
01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:38.671
I'm...

1270
01:43:40.572 --> 01:43:41.974
I'm the unforgivable.

1271
01:43:47.712 --> 01:43:48.915
An eye for an eye

1272
01:43:52.452 --> 01:43:54.884
leaves everybody blind.

1273
01:43:54.886 --> 01:43:56.022
Everybody blind.

1274
01:44:00.225 --> 01:44:01.060
Thank you.

1275
01:44:11.671 --> 01:44:14.704
Will you take me
back to New York City?


1276
01:44:14.706 --> 01:44:16.941
I would love to take
you back to New York City.


1277
01:44:16.943 --> 01:44:18.909
I know a secret
road out of here.


1278
01:44:18.911 --> 01:44:20.511
We could get away tonight.

1279
01:44:20.513 --> 01:44:22.245
We could escape.

1280
01:44:22.247 --> 01:44:23.179
I'd like that a lot.

1281
01:44:23.181 --> 01:44:25.615
Yeah, I love New York City.

1282
01:44:25.617 --> 01:44:26.883
It's the coolest place.

1283
01:44:26.885 --> 01:44:29.486
I'm saved me up a
couple thousand bucks


1284
01:44:29.488 --> 01:44:30.920
doing odd jobs, you know?

1285
01:44:30.922 --> 01:44:33.523
I'm gonna go there
and I'm gonna open


1286
01:44:33.525 --> 01:44:37.261
the most famous flower
shop they've ever seen.


1287
01:44:37.263 --> 01:44:39.195
They oughta love flowers there.

1288
01:44:39.197 --> 01:44:42.031
I mean, there's not much
nature there, you know?


1289
01:44:42.033 --> 01:44:43.767
It's true, there's not.

1290
01:44:43.769 --> 01:44:44.602
There's really not.

1291
01:44:44.604 --> 01:44:45.806
Yeah.

1292
01:44:46.939 --> 01:44:50.577
I think a flower
shop is a lovely idea.


1293
01:44:50.977 --> 01:44:52.479
Lovely idea.

1294
01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:58.018
So, so Herman's,

1295
01:44:59.050 --> 01:45:00.116
Herman's dead?

1296
01:45:00.118 --> 01:45:02.018
He's really dead?

1297
01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.588
How did you know?

1298
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:06.992
How did you know?

1299
01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:19.206
Because I killed him

1300
01:45:21.907 --> 01:45:22.775
with a sickle.

1301
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:27.112
I stabbed it deep
in his big fat back


1302
01:45:28.747 --> 01:45:32.051
and then as a bonus, I put
a bullet into his head.


1303
01:45:33.085 --> 01:45:33.920
You didn't.

1304
01:45:34.987 --> 01:45:36.122
Hell yeah, I did.

1305
01:45:38.991 --> 01:45:39.993
Oh my God.

1306
01:45:41.059 --> 01:45:41.894
Please,

1307
01:45:42.995 --> 01:45:44.230
it was...

1308
01:45:45.864 --> 01:45:47.000
it was gruesome.

1309
01:45:49.068 --> 01:45:51.134
Please, no more talk
about that, all right?


1310
01:45:51.136 --> 01:45:53.003
Yeah.

1311
01:45:53.005 --> 01:45:55.039
No more talk about that.

1312
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:55.876
Good.

1313
01:45:56.742 --> 01:45:59.008
You're so beautiful.

1314
01:45:59.010 --> 01:46:00.813
You're so beautiful.

1315
01:46:04.282 --> 01:46:05.184
Remember,

1316
01:46:08.019 --> 01:46:11.123
remember when you
called me "sweet juice?"


1317
01:46:12.058 --> 01:46:14.728
And you asked me
if I had some more.


1318
01:46:15.595 --> 01:46:18.532
I remember, I remember, yeah.

1319
01:46:19.297 --> 01:46:20.966
Well I do now.

1320
01:46:23.736 --> 01:46:24.571
Do you?

1321
01:46:26.072 --> 01:46:28.875
I mean, Christy, I'd be
lying if I said I didn't.


1322
01:46:30.141 --> 01:46:32.343
You're so gorgeous.

1323
01:46:33.179 --> 01:46:34.645
Hey, Kevin!

1324
01:46:34.647 --> 01:46:36.112
Oh yeah.

1325
01:46:36.114 --> 01:46:36.949
Oh yes.

1326
01:46:39.318 --> 01:46:41.651
What the fuck are
you doing out there?


1327
01:46:41.653 --> 01:46:43.320
Shut the fuck up, Scotty!

1328
01:46:43.322 --> 01:46:44.925
I'm taking a crap, man!

1329
01:46:57.903 --> 01:46:59.203
Yeah.

1330
01:46:59.205 --> 01:47:00.674
Oh, yes.

1331
01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:05.241
Yeah, yeah.

1332
01:47:05.243 --> 01:47:06.278
Oh, please.

1333
01:47:10.116 --> 01:47:11.051
Yes, baby.

1334
01:47:15.921 --> 01:47:17.087
Yes.

1335
01:47:17.089 --> 01:47:18.355
Oh.

1336
01:47:18.357 --> 01:47:19.789
Yes.

1337
01:47:22.662 --> 01:47:25.195
Your hands are so good.

1338
01:47:25.197 --> 01:47:26.232
Yes.

1339
01:47:27.065 --> 01:47:28.100
Yes, yes.

1340
01:47:29.402 --> 01:47:30.700
Oh God, yes.

1341
01:47:30.702 --> 01:47:32.335
Oh God, yeah.

1342
01:47:35.373 --> 01:47:37.106
Oh, yes.

1343
01:47:37.108 --> 01:47:39.209
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:40.043
Oh, yes.

1345
01:47:47.853 --> 01:47:52.088
Yeah, don't stop.

1346
01:47:54.926 --> 01:47:56.362
Yeah, yeah, oh.

1347
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:59.632
Holy shit.

1348
01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.432
What're you doing,
you jerking off?


1349
01:48:02.434 --> 01:48:03.767
Oh my God.

1350
01:48:03.769 --> 01:48:08.341
Go, go, go, go!

1351
01:48:18.317 --> 01:48:20.252
Yes, yes.

1352
01:48:22.354 --> 01:48:23.352
Yeah.

1353
01:48:23.354 --> 01:48:24.189
Oh, yeah.

1354
01:48:25.424 --> 01:48:26.956
Oh fuck yes!

1355
01:48:26.958 --> 01:48:28.292
Oh fuck yes!

1356
01:48:33.099 --> 01:48:33.996
Oh, God, yes.

1357
01:48:33.998 --> 01:48:35.231
Oh, Jesus.

1358
01:48:35.233 --> 01:48:38.000
It's so sweet,
it's painful, baby.


1359
01:48:38.002 --> 01:48:39.102
Yeah.

1360
01:48:39.104 --> 01:48:40.303
Yeah.

1361
01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:52.348
Oh my God!

1362
01:48:54.953 --> 01:48:56.120
Oh, Jesus!

1363
01:48:56.122 --> 01:48:57.286
Jesus!

1364
01:48:58.290 --> 01:48:59.956
What have you done to me?!

1365
01:48:59.958 --> 01:49:01.124
Oh God!

1366
01:49:02.995 --> 01:49:03.830
Oh, Jesus!

1367
01:49:04.529 --> 01:49:06.029
Oh, God!

1368
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:07.330
Oh, Jesus!

1369
01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:14.103
It won't stop!

1370
01:49:14.105 --> 01:49:15.905
It won't stop bleeding!

1371
01:49:20.446 --> 01:49:21.779
Oh, God!

1372
01:49:21.781 --> 01:49:23.216
Oh, God, help me!

1373
01:49:24.215 --> 01:49:25.348
My dick!

1374
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:26.517
What have you done to me?!

1375
01:49:26.519 --> 01:49:27.351
Kevin?

1376
01:49:32.891 --> 01:49:33.490
Kevin?

1377
01:49:35.327 --> 01:49:36.362
Kevin?

1378
01:49:37.196 --> 01:49:38.230
Kevin!

1379
01:49:39.197 --> 01:49:41.063
Please help me!

1380
01:49:41.065 --> 01:49:43.200
- She cut me!
- Kevin!


1381
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:45.502
Oh, God!

1382
01:49:47.273 --> 01:49:49.906
Oh, God, it won't stop!

1383
01:49:49.908 --> 01:49:52.241
It won't stop bleeding!

1384
01:49:52.243 --> 01:49:53.846
Kevin!

1385
01:49:55.046 --> 01:49:56.512
I'm coming, Kevin!

1386
01:49:56.514 --> 01:49:57.914
I'm coming!

1387
01:49:57.916 --> 01:49:58.751
Kevin!

1388
01:50:00.051 --> 01:50:02.218
It won't stop bleeding!

1389
01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.219
I'll kill you!

1390
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.422
I'll fucking kill you!

1391
01:50:05.424 --> 01:50:07.223
Come back here, you bitch!

1392
01:50:07.225 --> 01:50:08.258
Come here!

1393
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.593
You turn around!

1394
01:50:09.595 --> 01:50:12.866
You turn around and you
face your angel of death!


1395
01:50:14.366 --> 01:50:16.102
I got my mother's genes

1396
01:50:17.303 --> 01:50:20.305
but I ain't got her patience
and I don't resort to trickery.


1397
01:50:21.306 --> 01:50:23.440
I got straight for the balls.

1398
01:50:37.156 --> 01:50:38.158
Why'd you do that?

1399
01:50:40.391 --> 01:50:42.295
You didn't have to
do that, you didn't.


1400
01:50:44.095 --> 01:50:47.364
It ain't fair, I
ain't got no gun.


1401
01:50:47.366 --> 01:50:49.365
Just a fucking knife.

1402
01:50:49.367 --> 01:50:50.267
Just a fucking knife!

1403
01:50:50.269 --> 01:50:53.072
It ain't no match for
your gun, it ain't!


1404
01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.447
What're you gonna do to me now?

1405
01:51:04.449 --> 01:51:06.350
I did nothing to deserve this!

1406
01:51:08.053 --> 01:51:11.053
I was dragged into
this mess by Becky


1407
01:51:11.055 --> 01:51:14.458
and Herman and
Kevin and I'm sorry.


1408
01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.395
I'm sorry, look!

1409
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:20.129
I'm sorry I was too chicken-hearted
not to listen to them.


1410
01:51:20.131 --> 01:51:21.397
I know you won't believe this

1411
01:51:21.399 --> 01:51:23.432
but I was gonna, I was
gonna drive you back!


1412
01:51:25.237 --> 01:51:29.074
I was gonna drive you back
to New York City in my van


1413
01:51:30.309 --> 01:51:33.413
and just take you home, I
was gonna take you home.


1414
01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.379
I'm sorry.

1415
01:51:36.381 --> 01:51:39.482
I'm sorry for what we
did to your mother.


1416
01:51:39.484 --> 01:51:42.486
Please, I'm too young to die!

1417
01:51:42.488 --> 01:51:44.357
Too fucking young!

1418
01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:48.624
I know it ain't your
fault, you're innocent!


1419
01:51:48.626 --> 01:51:51.093
You're innocent, I swear!

1420
01:51:53.264 --> 01:51:54.364
Don't.

1421
01:51:54.366 --> 01:51:55.368
Hey!

1422
01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:59.002
You fucking psycho bitch!

1423
01:52:00.339 --> 01:52:03.072
You're fucking sicker
than your mother!


1424
01:52:04.475 --> 01:52:06.410
You're fucking sicker!

1425
01:52:08.514 --> 01:52:09.579
I'm sorry!

1426
01:52:11.449 --> 01:52:14.053
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1427
01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:16.553
Kevin!

1428
01:52:16.555 --> 01:52:18.521
Fuck you, asshole!

1429
01:53:37.403 --> 01:53:38.237
Fuck.

1430
01:57:13.852 --> 01:57:15.621
Where is my mother?

1431
01:57:25.596 --> 01:57:26.398
Drop it.

1432
01:57:34.473 --> 01:57:35.774
What have you done with her?

1433
01:57:39.944 --> 01:57:40.779
Tell me!

1434
01:57:46.785 --> 01:57:49.721
The next one goes into
your fucking head.


1435
01:57:55.727 --> 01:57:59.795
You fucking crazy bitch!

1436
01:57:59.797 --> 01:58:02.867
Where is my mother?!

1437
01:58:04.769 --> 01:58:06.803
You better speak up

1438
01:58:06.805 --> 01:58:08.838
or I'm gonna punch a
whole in every bone


1439
01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:11.574
in your freaking body and then
I'm gonna rip off your flesh,


1440
01:58:11.576 --> 01:58:12.979
piece by piece!

1441
01:58:17.748 --> 01:58:20.549
You don't only got his eyes.

1442
01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:22.819
You're fucking bullheaded too.

1443
01:58:27.358 --> 01:58:28.758
Okay, kid-o, okay!

1444
01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.860
You wanna know what I
did with your mamma?


1445
01:58:30.862 --> 01:58:32.529
You wanna know?

1446
01:58:32.531 --> 01:58:36.499
I dumped her in a fucking
grave and then I spat on her,


1447
01:58:36.501 --> 01:58:38.868
the same fucking grave
I'm gonna dump you!


1448
01:58:40.671 --> 01:58:42.806
Hear me, dear God!

1449
01:58:42.808 --> 01:58:47.343
I'm killing the daughter
of the messenger of Satan!


1450
01:58:47.345 --> 01:58:50.015
Kill her to wash away
my husband's guilt!


1451
01:58:51.515 --> 01:58:52.951
Die, child.

1452
01:58:53.919 --> 01:58:55.118
Die.

1453
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.524
So that Johnny's sins
can die with you!


1454
01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:07.062
What the fuck are you doing,
you dumb moronic assholes!


1455
01:59:07.064 --> 01:59:10.033
You gotta get her, her, not me!

1456
01:59:10.035 --> 01:59:12.602
Dispatch her to fucking hell!

1457
01:59:12.604 --> 01:59:13.902
Fucking hell!

1458
01:59:13.904 --> 01:59:16.004
Yes, dear, yes.

1459
01:59:16.006 --> 01:59:17.973
This is where we're
gonna dispatch you too.


1460
01:59:17.975 --> 01:59:20.642
Fucking hell! Fucking hell!

1461
01:59:20.644 --> 01:59:22.779
Here, let me help you, dear.

1462
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:24.880
Johnny's gonna be mad at you.

1463
01:59:24.882 --> 01:59:27.851
Mad, he ain't never
gonna forgive you, never!


1464
01:59:27.853 --> 01:59:31.987
You goddamn bunch of dopey
senile fucking douchebags!


1465
01:59:45.937 --> 01:59:47.035
Fucking bitch!

1466
01:59:47.037 --> 01:59:48.570
You bitch!

1467
01:59:48.572 --> 01:59:49.472
You bitch!

1468
02:00:06.724 --> 02:00:07.891
Bitch!

1469
02:00:07.893 --> 02:00:09.729
You piece of shit!

1470
02:00:14.032 --> 02:00:17.133
Whoopee, well done, Henry!

1471
02:00:19.904 --> 02:00:20.739
Well done!

1472
02:00:57.943 --> 02:01:00.613
Die,
you white trash.


1473
02:01:04.215 --> 02:01:05.647
Die!

1474
02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:23.501
Johnny's now
smiling in his grave!


1475
02:01:26.705 --> 02:01:31.039
We never did like this
fucking grease-smelling bitch!


1476
02:01:31.041 --> 02:01:31.876
Nobody does.

1477
02:01:32.978 --> 02:01:34.677
Nope.

1478
02:01:34.679 --> 02:01:36.748
Hey, girly, girl.

1479
02:01:38.716 --> 02:01:41.821
We know where she hid your mom.

1480
02:01:43.587 --> 02:01:46.724
She buried her next to
your father's grave.


1481
02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:50.125
My father?

1482
02:01:50.127 --> 02:01:50.929
Yeah.

1483
02:01:52.063 --> 02:01:53.098
Come with us.

1484
02:01:53.998 --> 02:01:55.067
We'll show you.

1485
02:01:56.701 --> 02:01:58.167
Come on.

1486
02:02:04.542 --> 02:02:08.143
Come, dear, come before
it gets too late.


1487
02:02:14.019 --> 02:02:18.657
Look at this old fart,
dancing like a drunken monkey!


1488
02:02:20.992 --> 02:02:22.225
Hey, Henry!

1489
02:02:22.227 --> 02:02:24.326
Do a crotch grab!

1490
02:02:24.328 --> 02:02:27.163
Make it look like you
got something there.


1491
02:02:32.002 --> 02:02:33.938
Come on, sweetie, follow us.

1492
02:02:59.930 --> 02:03:02.634
Take a swig, hon,
it'll calm your nerves.


1493
02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:05.136
Thanks.

1494
02:03:10.108 --> 02:03:12.878
Ain't she beautiful, Henry?

1495
02:03:14.813 --> 02:03:15.648
I'm what?

1496
02:03:17.148 --> 02:03:18.050
Not you!

1497
02:03:19.216 --> 02:03:22.020
You look like an old,
rotten baked potato!


1498
02:03:23.988 --> 02:03:25.290
She likes baked potatoes?

1499
02:03:27.058 --> 02:03:28.027
I do too.

1500
02:03:29.627 --> 02:03:32.163
But only them yummy sweet ones.

1501
02:03:34.032 --> 02:03:38.034
Nobody gives a shit what
kind of veggies you like.


1502
02:03:38.036 --> 02:03:41.204
Just keep your goofy
eyes on the road.


1503
02:03:41.206 --> 02:03:42.875
Yes, dear.

1504
02:03:45.175 --> 02:03:48.279
I'm getting on in years too but

1505
02:03:49.346 --> 02:03:50.849
I ain't screwed up here.

1506
02:03:52.183 --> 02:03:53.852
Not yet, anyway.

1507
02:04:35.126 --> 02:04:36.862
Henry, loud!

1508
02:04:49.407 --> 02:04:52.107
What's the occasion, Henry?

1509
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:55.014
Trying to shine up
to the young lady?


1510
02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:59.781
Last time this old fart
helped me out of an automobile


1511
02:04:59.783 --> 02:05:01.185
was on our wedding night.

1512
02:05:02.053 --> 02:05:03.221
Not true, not true.

1513
02:05:04.122 --> 02:05:06.188
I still do.

1514
02:05:06.190 --> 02:05:10.093
Only when you wanna
get in my panties.


1515
02:05:10.095 --> 02:05:15.100
Henry, you ain't gonna fuck
me tonight or any other night.


1516
02:05:16.266 --> 02:05:18.334
This pothole is sealed
with rust and dust.


1517
02:05:18.336 --> 02:05:21.503
You can't break into it
even with a jackhammer,


1518
02:05:21.505 --> 02:05:25.374
let alone your fucking
puny, lifeless prick!


1519
02:05:44.194 --> 02:05:45.895
Come, dear.

1520
02:05:45.897 --> 02:05:47.329
Come, sweetie.

1521
02:05:47.331 --> 02:05:48.166
Follow us.

1522
02:07:10.514 --> 02:07:13.050
It's all over now, Mother.

1523
02:07:15.953 --> 02:07:19.190
I made those bastards pay
for what they did to you.


1524
02:07:24.562 --> 02:07:27.099
And for what they did to me.

1525
02:07:49.453 --> 02:07:51.956
I love you so much, Mom.

1526
02:07:54.992 --> 02:07:58.162
I'm gonna give you the
most beautiful funeral


1527
02:07:59.397 --> 02:08:02.298
and the biggest that New
York City has ever seen.


1528
02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:04.503
With lots and lots of flowers.

1529
02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:19.350
Which one is my, my father?

1530
02:08:44.341 --> 02:08:46.210
Mom, I uh,

1531
02:08:48.412 --> 02:08:49.881
I get the picture now.

1532
02:08:53.417 --> 02:08:55.519
I understand why you
never wanted to tell me.


1533
02:08:58.288 --> 02:09:00.492
You didn't want me
to feel like dirt.


1534
02:09:02.393 --> 02:09:04.560
You were afraid that I would
be obsessed with the fact


1535
02:09:04.562 --> 02:09:07.498
that the seed from which
I was conceived was evil.


1536
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:16.004
But, Mom,

1537
02:09:16.006 --> 02:09:17.241
I already knew.

1538
02:09:21.511 --> 02:09:22.581
I always knew.

1539
02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.288
But hey, Mom,

1540
02:09:31.555 --> 02:09:33.958
I don't want you to
worry anymore now, okay?


1541
02:09:36.126 --> 02:09:37.493
Because now that it's
clear in my mind,


1542
02:09:37.495 --> 02:09:39.965
I want you to know
that I am yours


1543
02:09:41.398 --> 02:09:44.502
and I am only yours.

1544
02:09:47.005 --> 02:09:48.540
And I am mighty proud of it.

1545
02:09:59.751 --> 02:10:01.186
I wanna take her home now.

1546
02:10:02.487 --> 02:10:04.219
Will you help me?

1547
02:10:04.221 --> 02:10:05.456
We sure can, dear.

1548
02:10:06.657 --> 02:10:09.393
You can even borrow old Lucy,
here, to take her with you.


1549
02:10:10.595 --> 02:10:14.530
Old Lucy, she's been with
us since we got married.


1550
02:10:14.532 --> 02:10:16.365
We aint guaranteeing
she'll make it


1551
02:10:16.367 --> 02:10:19.571
as far as New York City
but it's all we got.


1552
02:10:20.738 --> 02:10:23.638
Well, I'll bring her
back to you, I promise.


1553
02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.473
Then again, maybe
I'll just junk her


1554
02:10:25.475 --> 02:10:27.476
and buy you a brand new pickup.

1555
02:10:27.478 --> 02:10:29.178
How sweet of you.

1556
02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:30.812
Sweet, sweet.

1557
02:10:30.814 --> 02:10:31.716
Very sweet.

1558
02:10:34.352 --> 02:10:36.555
Lift the board up, Henry.

1559
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:40.192
Yes, dear.

1560
02:11:04.849 --> 02:11:05.684
Oh, Mom.

1561
02:11:07.085 --> 02:11:07.719
Mom.

1562
02:11:10.254 --> 02:11:11.089
Mom.

1563
02:11:21.232 --> 02:11:22.865
Help me! Help me!

1564
02:11:22.867 --> 02:11:24.600
Help me!

1565
02:11:24.602 --> 02:11:27.169
Die, child, die, child!

1566
02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:29.174
Die! Die! Die!

1567
02:11:37.881 --> 02:11:39.581
Don't you dare!

1568
02:11:39.583 --> 02:11:40.715
Die!

1569
02:11:43.688 --> 02:11:45.420
Repent, child!

1570
02:11:45.422 --> 02:11:46.588
Repent!

1571
02:11:50.795 --> 02:11:53.795
For the Kingdom of
Heaven is forthcoming!


1572
02:11:53.797 --> 02:11:56.197
Repent! Repent! Repent!

1573
02:11:58.836 --> 02:12:01.370
I come not to
call the righteous


1574
02:12:01.372 --> 02:12:03.705
but sinners to repentance!

1575
02:12:05.376 --> 02:12:09.777
Joy shall be in Heaven over
one sinner that repents.


1576
02:12:09.779 --> 02:12:14.350
Repent, ye child, repent or
you shall be doomed in Hell!


1577
02:12:14.352 --> 02:12:17.589
Doomed! Doomed!
Doomed in Hell!


1578
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:19.888
Doomed in Hell!

1579
02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:22.423
Who so sheds man's blood

1580
02:12:22.425 --> 02:12:25.593
by man shall her blood be shed!

1581
02:12:25.595 --> 02:12:27.362
Shall her blood be shed!

1582
02:12:27.364 --> 02:12:29.664
Shed! Shed! Shed your blood!

1583
02:12:29.666 --> 02:12:31.366
Repent!

1584
02:12:31.368 --> 02:12:32.200
Repent!

1585
02:12:33.671 --> 02:12:37.409
Vengeance is mine, I shall
repay, saith the Lord!


1586
02:12:38.376 --> 02:12:39.642
An eye for an eye,

1587
02:12:39.644 --> 02:12:41.343
a tooth for a tooth!

1588
02:12:42.913 --> 02:12:44.280
A hand for a hand,

1589
02:12:44.282 --> 02:12:45.813
a foot for a foot!

1590
02:12:47.217 --> 02:12:48.950
A life for a life!

1591
02:12:48.952 --> 02:12:50.486
Amen!

1592
02:12:50.488 --> 02:12:51.323
Amen!

1593
02:12:55.725 --> 02:12:58.660
You shall both be doomed!

1594
02:12:58.662 --> 02:12:59.830
Mother and child!

1595
02:13:01.398 --> 02:13:05.169
Doomed until the end of time!

1596
02:13:09.873 --> 02:13:12.740
Doomed until the end of time!

1597
02:13:13.978 --> 02:13:15.643
Doomed!

1598
02:13:15.645 --> 02:13:16.844
Mother and child!

1599
02:13:16.846 --> 02:13:21.286
Doomed until the end of time!

1600
02:13:31.261 --> 02:13:32.163
Die! Die!

1601
02:13:33.797 --> 02:13:35.697
Die!

1602
02:13:39.002 --> 02:13:40.604
Doomed! Doomed!

1603
02:13:41.706 --> 02:13:43.472
Doomed! Doomed!

1604
02:13:43.474 --> 02:13:44.743
Doomed! Doomed!

1605
02:13:45.609 --> 02:13:47.610
Until the end of time!

1606
02:13:47.612 --> 02:13:49.614
Doomed! Doomed Doomed!

1607
02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:01.191
Hey, Johnny,

1608
02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:05.660
Papa's here, speaking to you.

1609
02:14:05.662 --> 02:14:07.531
And your momma too.

1610
02:14:08.666 --> 02:14:12.534
Mathew, it's your grandma,
you hearing me, boy?


1611
02:14:12.536 --> 02:14:14.503
We got her, oh, we got her!

1612
02:14:14.505 --> 02:14:15.838
Yes we did!

1613
02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:17.641
We got the bitch, boys!

1614
02:14:18.041 --> 02:14:19.408
We got her good!

1615
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:21.977
And her daughter too!

1616
02:14:21.979 --> 02:14:24.812
We got your daughter, Johnny.

1617
02:14:24.814 --> 02:14:28.385
Our bastard
granddaughter, Johnny!


1618
02:14:40.797 --> 02:14:41.733
Johnny,

1619
02:14:42.832 --> 02:14:44.767
Matthew, Andy,

1620
02:14:44.769 --> 02:14:45.804
Stanley!

1621
02:14:47.638 --> 02:14:49.573
Oh hear me!

1622
02:14:51.675 --> 02:14:56.313
You can now rest in peace
forever and ever, amen!


1623
02:14:57.547 --> 02:14:58.847
Amen.

1624
02:14:58.849 --> 02:14:59.847
Amen.

1625
02:14:59.849 --> 02:15:01.952
Here, fellas, take a swig.

1626
02:15:03.953 --> 02:15:08.557
Time to cheer up!

1627
02:15:08.559 --> 02:15:11.060
Yay, though I
walk through the valley


1628
02:15:11.062 --> 02:15:13.428
of the shadow of death,

1629
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:15.763
I will fear no evil.

1630
02:15:15.765 --> 02:15:17.533
Fear no evil!

1631
02:15:17.535 --> 02:15:18.767
Fear no evil!

1632
02:15:18.769 --> 02:15:23.871
For though art with us, thy
rod and they staff comfort us.


1633
02:15:23.873 --> 02:15:26.808
- They Comfort
us, they comfort us!


1634
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:29.611
And the Lord went before
us in a pillar of cloud


1635
02:15:29.613 --> 02:15:31.547
to lead us the way.

1636
02:15:31.549 --> 02:15:34.816
To lead us the way,
to lead us the way!


1637
02:15:34.818 --> 02:15:38.920
And by night, in a pillar
of fire, to give us light.


1638
02:15:38.922 --> 02:15:42.790
To give us light,
to give us light!


1639
02:15:42.792 --> 02:15:45.928
My soul shall be
joyful in the Lord,


1640
02:15:45.930 --> 02:15:48.731
it rejoices in his salvation.

1641
02:15:48.733 --> 02:15:50.869
It rejoices in his salvation!

1642
02:15:52.036 --> 02:15:54.669
Yay, though I walk
through the valley


1643
02:15:54.671 --> 02:15:57.839
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.


1644
02:15:57.841 --> 02:15:59.874
Fear no evil!

1645
02:15:59.876 --> 02:16:01.075
Fear no evil!

1646
02:16:01.077 --> 02:16:04.445
For thou art with us,
thy rod and thy staff.


1647
02:16:16.894 --> 02:16:19.794
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1648
02:16:19.796 --> 02:16:22.097
hallowed be thy name.

1649
02:16:22.099 --> 02:16:24.700
Thy kingdom come,

1650
02:16:24.702 --> 02:16:26.802
thy will be done,

1651
02:16:26.804 --> 02:16:29.804
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

1652
02:16:29.806 --> 02:16:32.908
Give us this day
our daily bread.


1653
02:16:32.910 --> 02:16:34.876
Amen, Amen!

1654
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:43.519
The Lord goes before us.

1655
02:16:43.521 --> 02:16:46.020
My soul shall be
joyful in the Lord.


1656
02:16:46.022 --> 02:16:48.923
It rejoices in His salvation.

1657
02:16:48.925 --> 02:16:50.626
Stop that fucked up

1658
02:16:50.628 --> 02:16:52.764
Holy Bible crap!

1659
02:16:53.831 --> 02:16:56.798
Look what she done to my face.

1660
02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:57.698
Oh no.

1661
02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:58.733
Look!

1662
02:16:58.735 --> 02:16:59.570
Oh no!

1663
02:17:01.172 --> 02:17:02.841
Oh no!

1664
02:17:06.911 --> 02:17:10.147
My savor, Jesus
Christ, where are you?


1665
02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.886
What am I to do now without you?

1666
02:17:18.888 --> 02:17:20.958
What? What?

1667
02:17:38.742 --> 02:17:39.878
Go ahead, child.

1668
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:44.515
Do what you gotta do.

1669
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:49.017
But first let me say a prayer.

1670
02:17:49.019 --> 02:17:50.621
A prayer to save you.

1671
02:17:51.621 --> 02:17:53.555
To free you of the evil spirits

1672
02:17:53.557 --> 02:17:55.894
that dwell in your
body and soul.


1673
02:17:57.528 --> 02:17:58.530
Or else, you,

1674
02:17:59.896 --> 02:18:00.697
like your mother,

1675
02:18:02.199 --> 02:18:04.935
will be lead straight
into Satan's kingdom.


1676
02:18:06.069 --> 02:18:08.036
Oh, you say a
pray for yourself,


1677
02:18:08.038 --> 02:18:13.074
you goddamn miserable old fool!

1678
02:18:13.076 --> 02:18:15.012
Why don't you repent?!

1679
02:18:15.679 --> 02:18:16.147
You!

1680
02:18:19.583 --> 02:18:21.085
No prayer for you, child.

1681
02:18:23.987 --> 02:18:25.089
You ain't deserve it.

1682
02:18:29.593 --> 02:18:31.260
Because you're doomed.

1683
02:18:31.262 --> 02:18:35.233
Doomed to the
everlasting fire of hell.


1684
02:18:41.672 --> 02:18:44.740
My life ain't worth
no goddamn shit now


1685
02:18:44.742 --> 02:18:46.744
without my beloved wife.

1686
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:49.480
Ain't worth no goddamn shit.

1687
02:18:52.116 --> 02:18:53.715
Now go ahead.

1688
02:18:53.717 --> 02:18:54.685
Pull the trigger.

1689
02:18:55.753 --> 02:18:56.587
Pull it.

1690
02:18:58.188 --> 02:19:02.189
Keep us together in
death as we was in life.


1691
02:19:02.191 --> 02:19:05.562
Dispatch us to the
Kingdom of Heaven.


1692
02:19:08.164 --> 02:19:09.066
Oh, I will.

1693
02:19:11.235 --> 02:19:12.504
First,

1694
02:19:13.804 --> 02:19:15.974
you gotta keep
your promise to me.


1695
02:20:06.289 --> 02:20:08.158
You be good to old Lucy, here.

1696
02:20:10.093 --> 02:20:11.261
She don't need much.

1697
02:20:14.064 --> 02:20:16.163
Just dump plenty of
Mobile 1 down her throat


1698
02:20:16.165 --> 02:20:18.199
to quench her thirst.

1699
02:20:18.201 --> 02:20:19.304
She'll keep on going.

1700
02:20:20.671 --> 02:20:22.105
They don't make them
like this no more.


1701
02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:28.179
I kept my promise, young lady.

1702
02:20:29.846 --> 02:20:31.148
It's your turn to keep yours.

1703
02:20:52.702 --> 02:20:53.370
So be it.

1704
02:20:57.074 --> 02:20:59.674
Forcing a man to go on living
without his beloved wife


1705
02:20:59.676 --> 02:21:02.714
aint but a cruel and
heartless punishment, child.


1706
02:21:03.914 --> 02:21:07.085
It's all in these
Almighty's hands, all.


1707
02:21:08.252 --> 02:21:10.152
Reckon He wishes
me to go on living


1708
02:21:10.154 --> 02:21:11.385
because He wants me to witness

1709
02:21:11.387 --> 02:21:14.391
the day His wrath
descends upon you.


1710
02:21:15.893 --> 02:21:18.196
The mighty wrath of God.

1711
02:21:20.197 --> 02:21:23.898
May God have mercy on you,

1712
02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:25.269
my dear grandchild.

1713
02:21:42.085 --> 02:21:45.022
And may He have
mercy on you too,


1714
02:21:46.022 --> 02:21:46.991
dear grandpa.

1715
02:22:18.121 --> 02:22:21.893
I ain't come to ask you
for your forgiveness.


1716
02:22:25.262 --> 02:22:28.196
I did what I did.

1717
02:22:28.198 --> 02:22:30.468
An eye for an eye.

1718
02:22:31.167 --> 02:22:33.071
That's in your bible.

1719
02:24:14.271 --> 02:24:15.903
Mom?

1720
02:24:15.905 --> 02:24:17.137
Mom?

1721
02:24:17.139 --> 02:24:19.039
Mom?

1722
02:24:19.041 --> 02:24:20.608
Is she here?

1723
02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:21.444
Mom?

1724
02:24:26.083 --> 02:24:26.917
Mom?

1725
02:24:30.187 --> 02:24:32.155
Let me go check
over here on the side.


1726
02:24:35.225 --> 02:24:36.059
Mom?

1727
02:24:37.593 --> 02:24:39.326
Where could she be?

1728
02:24:39.328 --> 02:24:40.528
I don't know.

1729
02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:42.330
She's usually
here at this time.


1730
02:24:42.332 --> 02:24:43.365
I don't know.

1731
02:24:54.343 --> 02:24:56.477
Isn't that grandpa's old Lucy?

1732
02:25:42.459 --> 02:25:43.661
That was really odd.

1733
02:25:45.227 --> 02:25:47.429
That was definitely his truck.

1734
02:25:47.431 --> 02:25:49.097
But who was that girl?

1735
02:25:49.099 --> 02:25:51.432
I don't know.

1736
02:25:51.434 --> 02:25:52.602
I've never seen her before.
