"Ringo Starr is not the greatest
drummer in the world.

He's not even the greatest
drummer in the Beatles."

Yeah, he never
said that, actually.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.515
Not my buddies.
They were just some guys.


648
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:43.185
We were fucking...
Okay, so anyway,


649
00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:47.289
how long were you
in the back room,


650
00:27:47.322 --> 00:27:49.024
away from the rest
of the party,


651
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:52.161
with this guy...
for how long, exactly?


652
00:27:52.194 --> 00:27:54.430
I was in the back room -

653
00:27:54.463 --> 00:27:56.065
with Melanie -

654
00:27:56.098 --> 00:27:57.934
like, about 15,

655
00:27:57.966 --> 00:27:59.502
Twenty minutes?

656
00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:01.670
And this is the first
I'm hearing about it?


657
00:28:01.704 --> 00:28:03.638
You didn't even
know I was gone.


658
00:28:03.671 --> 00:28:05.173
Well, how could I
notice you were gone


659
00:28:05.206 --> 00:28:06.542
if you weren't around?

660
00:28:06.574 --> 00:28:07.542
What does that
even mean?


661
00:28:07.576 --> 00:28:09.178
[laughs]

662
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:10.413
You know what?
It just... It...


663
00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:12.247
Forget it.

664
00:28:12.281 --> 00:28:13.382
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.


665
00:28:13.415 --> 00:28:16.051
He's just an old
pornographer.


666
00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:35.503
[typing]

667
00:28:35.536 --> 00:28:38.606
[clicking]

668
00:28:38.639 --> 00:28:41.243
Aha!

669
00:28:41.275 --> 00:28:43.244
Look at that.

670
00:28:43.278 --> 00:28:44.647
Look at that.

671
00:28:46.314 --> 00:28:48.650
Jonathan at work.

672
00:28:48.684 --> 00:28:49.652
Eh? Look at him.

673
00:28:49.685 --> 00:28:51.988
Look at that face.

674
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:53.188
What a phony.

675
00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:54.389
He looks like
he just discovered


676
00:28:54.423 --> 00:28:56.592
the last fucking
unicorn or something.


677
00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:59.428
Wow, Perry...

678
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:03.232
These are not
just photographs.


679
00:29:03.264 --> 00:29:07.069
Wow. They're like
meditations, really.


680
00:29:07.101 --> 00:29:09.071
I mean,

681
00:29:09.103 --> 00:29:13.641
this is about feeling,
about life.


682
00:29:13.675 --> 00:29:17.079
It's not just
the flesh. It's...


683
00:29:17.111 --> 00:29:21.050
It's the spirit.

684
00:29:21.082 --> 00:29:24.387
It's about what
it means to be...


685
00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:28.090
to be a woman,
and to be a man.


686
00:29:28.122 --> 00:29:31.426
To be a human,
really.


687
00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.661
What it feels
to have a vagina,


688
00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:36.232
and to be
in a vagina,


689
00:29:36.264 --> 00:29:38.367
or near a vagina,

690
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.570
or kept out
of a vagina.


691
00:29:42.771 --> 00:29:44.673
[Perry]
Double-park near a vagina,


692
00:29:44.705 --> 00:29:48.811
or dry-clean
a vagina, or...


693
00:29:48.843 --> 00:29:50.779
- Ay, Perry... [mutters]
- ...donate a vagina, or...


694
00:29:50.812 --> 00:29:52.614
[both laugh]

695
00:29:52.648 --> 00:29:54.315
Shit.

696
00:29:54.349 --> 00:29:56.118
What?!

697
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.552
Come on!

698
00:29:57.586 --> 00:29:59.655
Fuckin' vagina.

699
00:29:59.687 --> 00:30:02.757
You don't know!

700
00:30:02.791 --> 00:30:05.694
I don't know. Okay.

701
00:30:05.726 --> 00:30:07.463
The photos.

702
00:30:07.495 --> 00:30:10.432
Yeah. What don't I know
about the photos?


703
00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:13.269
They're Melanie.

704
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:14.436
Which photos?

705
00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:16.638
- Todas!
- Todas?


706
00:30:16.671 --> 00:30:19.274
Yeah. The tintypes?
They're Melanie.


707
00:30:19.308 --> 00:30:21.777
That was Melanie?

708
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.546
[woman]
Yeah. I know.


709
00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:26.282
It's amazing how,
through this process,


710
00:30:26.314 --> 00:30:29.184
her red just
went so dark.


711
00:30:29.217 --> 00:30:31.320
It's so beautiful.

712
00:30:33.621 --> 00:30:36.124
So beautiful?

713
00:30:36.157 --> 00:30:40.529
No. No! That was not
"so beautiful".


714
00:30:40.561 --> 00:30:43.365
That was the opposite
of beautiful!


715
00:30:43.398 --> 00:30:45.301
[woman] He helped her
get back into the wagon.


716
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:46.267
[Perry]
Yeah, "on the wagon".


717
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:48.169
Ay, sí, sí,
sí, sí, sí.


718
00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:50.840
Were they fucking?

719
00:30:50.872 --> 00:30:53.241
They have made
beautiful art together,


720
00:30:53.274 --> 00:30:54.376
and this is
what you ask?


721
00:30:54.408 --> 00:30:55.444
[Perry]
You didn't?


722
00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:57.213
No. It's none
of my business.


723
00:30:57.245 --> 00:30:58.580
Or yours.

724
00:30:58.613 --> 00:31:00.850
What is that, some kind of
Mexican yoga philosophy?


725
00:31:00.882 --> 00:31:02.750
Why does this
bother you so much?


726
00:31:02.783 --> 00:31:05.286
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You have to ask?


727
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.455
- So many reasons!
- Like... Like why?


728
00:31:07.488 --> 00:31:08.590
First of all,
I'll never be able


729
00:31:08.623 --> 00:31:10.257
to look Melanie
in the face again.


730
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:12.328
Oh, because now you know
she has a vagina!


731
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.862
No, but because
now I've seen it.


732
00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:15.431
She had one before,
you know.


733
00:31:15.464 --> 00:31:17.398
Yeah, but I hadn't
seen it before!


734
00:31:17.432 --> 00:31:18.834
And I didn't have to go
through the whole process


735
00:31:18.867 --> 00:31:21.770
of not having
seen it before.


736
00:31:21.802 --> 00:31:24.506
Wow, being a man
is just so... <i>busy!</i>


737
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.176
Oh, Lord love
a duck!


738
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:28.543
I'm gonna
take a shower!


739
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:32.615
[water running]

740
00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:47.163
He asked me.

741
00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:48.297
[Perry]
Honey?


742
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.633
Is the ultrasound
on Thursday or Friday?


743
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:53.601
He asked me.

744
00:31:53.635 --> 00:31:55.938
What's that, honey?
You say something?


745
00:31:55.971 --> 00:31:58.374
He asked me if I wanted
to pose for him.


746
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.878
And what did you say?

747
00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:13.756
♪ ♪

748
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:15.824
♪ ♪

749
00:32:15.857 --> 00:32:17.326
[Betsy]
It's pornography.


750
00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.461
[man]
It was expression, art.


751
00:32:19.494 --> 00:32:20.929
[Betsy] If it was art,
why didn't you buy one?


752
00:32:20.963 --> 00:32:23.299
[man] You know, I asked, and
Frank said it wasn't for sale.


753
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:25.333
You know what? We go out
once every forever,


754
00:32:25.367 --> 00:32:27.469
and I end up with my head
full of pussy.


755
00:32:27.502 --> 00:32:28.637
Okay, I guess...

756
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:30.638
Peep-show pornography!

757
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:31.673
According to you.

758
00:32:31.706 --> 00:32:33.975
According to society.

759
00:32:34.009 --> 00:32:34.944
Are you talking
Mapplethorpe?


760
00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:36.911
Because that trial
was based on obscenity,


761
00:32:36.945 --> 00:32:39.215
not pornography, and
they lost - your side lost.


762
00:32:39.247 --> 00:32:42.383
It's ugly.
And it's not my side.


763
00:32:42.417 --> 00:32:43.785
- Really?
- "Pornography:


764
00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:45.721
Sexually explicit pictures,
or writing,


765
00:32:45.753 --> 00:32:48.323
or other materials
whose primary purpose


766
00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:50.859
is to cause
sexual arousal."


767
00:32:50.891 --> 00:32:53.294
- There.
- "There" what?


768
00:32:53.328 --> 00:32:55.231
- Did you get an erection.
- No!


769
00:32:55.263 --> 00:32:57.532
[laughing] Liar!

770
00:32:57.565 --> 00:32:59.300
You know what? So what
if I did get hard?


771
00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:01.669
I mean, a guy can get
an erection if his cock


772
00:33:01.703 --> 00:33:03.405
hits the steering wheel
getting out of his car.


773
00:33:03.437 --> 00:33:04.907
It doesn't mean he's
gonna start fucking cars.


774
00:33:04.939 --> 00:33:06.874
You know, pictures like that
are made for one reason,


775
00:33:06.907 --> 00:33:08.377
and one reason alone:

776
00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:10.812
to turn you on,
to turn men on.


777
00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:12.580
Well, what about
creativity?


778
00:33:12.613 --> 00:33:14.949
You know, Georgia O'Keeffe,
freedom of expression.


779
00:33:14.983 --> 00:33:18.620
Greg, it was a show
about vaginas!


780
00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:20.522
How can you be this upset
over a bit of naked flesh?


781
00:33:20.554 --> 00:33:22.657
You have a daughter.

782
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.958
Yes...? And...?

783
00:33:23.992 --> 00:33:25.761
Do you want to see pictures
of Sophie like this?


784
00:33:25.793 --> 00:33:27.929
Come on.

785
00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:29.398
Do you look at pussy
pictures in front of her?


786
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.532
Do you say,
"Sit on Daddy's lap,


787
00:33:30.564 --> 00:33:31.633
and let's cruise
some porn sites"?


788
00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:33.769
That is disgusting.

789
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:35.571
I don't take a shit in front
of her either, okay?


790
00:33:35.603 --> 00:33:37.273
[chuckles]
Don't be simple.


791
00:33:37.305 --> 00:33:38.640
Simple?

792
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:42.043
Look, we don't
have sex in front of her.


793
00:33:42.077 --> 00:33:43.512
Is our sex pornographic?

794
00:33:43.544 --> 00:33:45.013
[Betsy]
We don't have sex.


795
00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:48.650
Is that what this
is all about?


796
00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:50.686
Look, somewhere along
the line, you disappeared.


797
00:33:50.718 --> 00:33:52.287
Whatever heart you had
has been buried


798
00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:53.856
under a mountain
of cum shots


799
00:33:53.888 --> 00:33:57.493
and camel toes
and nipple slips.


800
00:33:57.525 --> 00:33:58.860
Have you been snooping
on my computer?


801
00:33:58.894 --> 00:34:00.429
[Betsy]
I don't need to snoop, okay?


802
00:34:00.462 --> 00:34:01.797
You bring it
into our bed!


803
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.831
You and your goddamn

01:01:19.366 --> 01:01:22.369
Ah.

1441
01:01:22.402 --> 01:01:25.105
To... hmm...

1442
01:01:25.138 --> 01:01:26.572
art -

1443
01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:29.575
good, bad,
indifferent.


1444
01:01:29.609 --> 01:01:31.578
To art.

1445
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.513
- Hey...
- What did you think of...


1446
01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:34.047
[chuckles]

1447
01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:35.683
- Sorry.
- Sorry. [chuckles]


1448
01:01:35.715 --> 01:01:36.650
- But what did you...
- I was just...


1449
01:01:36.683 --> 01:01:39.585
[chuckles] Okay,
just wait.


1450
01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:43.289
What did you
like about it?


1451
01:01:43.322 --> 01:01:46.993
Alright. Um...

1452
01:01:47.027 --> 01:01:48.228
I thought the shots
were beautiful.


1453
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:49.697
- Mm.
- Subtle.


1454
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.365
Light to dark.

1455
01:01:51.397 --> 01:01:53.733
Abstractions, really.

1456
01:01:53.766 --> 01:01:57.705
I mean, like Edward Weston,
but with that weird...


1457
01:01:57.737 --> 01:01:59.505
- eerie, old technique.
- [Mickey] Mm.


1458
01:01:59.538 --> 01:02:02.342
And the shallow
depth of field.


1459
01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:05.611
Made them...
Made them look almost...


1460
01:02:05.645 --> 01:02:07.248
mythic.

1461
01:02:10.016 --> 01:02:11.384
Anything else?

1462
01:02:11.418 --> 01:02:12.519
[Brian]
No, I mean...


1463
01:02:12.552 --> 01:02:13.554
sexy. [chuckles]

1464
01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:15.255
It was very sexy.

1465
01:02:15.288 --> 01:02:17.023
It was hot. [laughs]

1466
01:02:17.056 --> 01:02:18.324
- Is it okay to say that?
- [Mickey] Mm-hmm.


1467
01:02:18.357 --> 01:02:20.393
[Brian laughs]

1468
01:02:20.427 --> 01:02:22.296
Which was your favourite?

1469
01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:24.197
[Brian]
Oh, you know,


1470
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:25.999
the landscape
stretching out to...


1471
01:02:26.032 --> 01:02:28.134
[both laugh]

1472
01:02:28.168 --> 01:02:29.269
[snorts] I'm sorry.

1473
01:02:29.302 --> 01:02:30.337
I'm sorry.
Okay, sorry.


1474
01:02:30.369 --> 01:02:32.005
What do you...
What do you think?


1475
01:02:33.607 --> 01:02:38.012
Mm...

1476
01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.446
Yeah.

1477
01:02:39.478 --> 01:02:41.181
[deep breath]

1478
01:02:41.214 --> 01:02:44.150
I thought they were
very sexy.


1479
01:02:44.183 --> 01:02:46.586
And hot.

1480
01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:50.290
I could go on, but...

1481
01:02:50.322 --> 01:02:52.091
I don't want
to get complicated.


1482
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.494
[Brian]
It's okay. I'm...


1483
01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:55.529
I mean, you
liked them alright.


1484
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:57.598
I did.

1485
01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.234
- Good.
- Yeah.


1486
01:03:00.266 --> 01:03:01.634
I'm glad.

1487
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:08.809
[Mickey]
Would you like another?


1488
01:03:08.842 --> 01:03:11.244
No, no.
I'm good, I'm good.


1489
01:03:11.277 --> 01:03:13.179
[Mickey]
Oh. What's the matter?


1490
01:03:13.212 --> 01:03:14.247
Nothing, nothing.

1491
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:17.051
Nothing? Really?

1492
01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:20.154
Really. I'm fine.
I'm just good.


1493
01:03:20.186 --> 01:03:21.688
You're not gonna have
a stroke, are you?


1494
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:23.257
- No.
- [Mickey laughs slightly]


1495
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:24.492
What's going on?

1496
01:03:26.525 --> 01:03:30.364
I guess I could use
that... that drink.


1497
01:03:30.397 --> 01:03:32.266
[grunts with effort]

1498
01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:34.835
Be right back.

1499
01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:36.369
[sighs]

1500
01:03:41.475 --> 01:03:43.576
[Tom]
So we had that fight,


1501
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.179
and then you
wanted us to talk


1502
01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:47.815
in front of your
therapist...


1503
01:03:47.848 --> 01:03:52.686
which was fine,
but it freaked me out.


1504
01:03:52.719 --> 01:03:55.589
[sighs] I knew what you
were gonna say.


1505
01:03:55.621 --> 01:03:57.123
It's not rocket science.

1506
01:03:57.156 --> 01:04:00.460
I... I know what I'm
like to deal with.


1507
01:04:00.493 --> 01:04:02.261
I just showed up,

1508
01:04:02.295 --> 01:04:05.499
and those words
came out of my mouth:


1509
01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:08.634
"I don't want
to do this anymore."


1510
01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:10.337
And you didn't even get a chance
to say what you wanted to.


1511
01:04:10.369 --> 01:04:14.340
No. I didn't.

1512
01:04:14.373 --> 01:04:16.342
And I was showing up 'cause
you wanted me to be there.


1513
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.545
I didn't know that was
gonna come out of my mouth.


1514
01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:22.882
So I went home.

1515
01:04:22.915 --> 01:04:26.452
I went home, and I was
completely spun out,


1516
01:04:26.485 --> 01:04:28.654
and I didn't
know why,


1517
01:04:28.688 --> 01:04:31.291
but I knew what I had said
was the truth.


1518
01:04:31.324 --> 01:04:32.626
I knew it.

1519
01:04:32.659 --> 01:04:34.761
But I didn't know
what it meant.


1520
01:04:34.793 --> 01:04:39.632
So I started looking,
and digging...


1521
01:04:39.665 --> 01:04:43.369
and that's
when I realized...


1522
01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:45.772
I want to be
in a relationship.


1523
01:04:45.804 --> 01:04:47.473
I'm better in
a relationship.


1524
01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:49.476
I'm... I want to be
a partner.


1525
01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:52.212
I don't want to be
this lone-wolf guy


1526
01:04:52.244 --> 01:04:53.513
that I think
is so cool.


1527
01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:58.351
I want... I want to be
a good partner to somebody.


1528
01:04:58.384 --> 01:05:00.286
That's lovely.
But just not with me.


1529
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:01.554
Thank you so much.

1530
01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:03.423
I don't want to have this
conversation anymore.


1531
01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:08.294
And guess what I did.
I made a list.


1532
01:05:08.328 --> 01:05:09.696
Well, what do you
think's on the list?


1533
01:05:09.728 --> 01:05:11.931
Creative? Smart?

1534
01:05:11.964 --> 01:05:13.566
Beautiful? Athletic?

1535
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.469
You know, maybe "really like
having sex as much as I do"?


1536
01:05:16.502 --> 01:05:18.538
A friend?

1537
01:05:18.572 --> 01:05:21.175
Someone...

1538
01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.443
Why are you
telling me this?


1539
01:05:23.476 --> 01:05:25.445
When I said,

1540
01:05:25.478 --> 01:05:29.183
"I don't want
to do this anymore,"


1541
01:05:29.215 --> 01:05:31.451
what I meant was
I don't want to do this.


1542
01:05:31.484 --> 01:05:33.186
I don't want
to do what the...


1543
01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:36.189
this half-in, half-out
bullshit that I always do.


1544
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.393
I want to be all in.

1545
01:05:44.464 --> 01:05:46.333
- All in?
- All in, yeah.


1546
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:51.938
I want to be
all in with you.


1547
01:06:06.987 --> 01:06:09.656
So you're going?

1548
01:06:09.688 --> 01:06:10.991
[Tom]
I said what I wanted to say.


1549
01:06:11.023 --> 01:06:14.560
Thank you
for listening.


1550
01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:16.597
If you want to call me,
you know you can.


1551
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.298
Um...

1552
01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:22.936
And if not, I'm sorry
that I bothered you.


1553
01:06:22.969 --> 01:06:26.873
[woman]
Tom.


1554
01:06:26.906 --> 01:06:28.609
Yeah?

1555
01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.012
I used to drive a cab.

1556
01:06:32.045 --> 01:06:33.547
- [Mickey] Really?
- Mm.


1557
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.815
[Mickey]
In Toronto?


1558
01:06:34.848 --> 01:06:36.750
- Oh, a long time ago.
- [Mickey] Yeah?


1559
01:06:36.782 --> 01:06:38.518
Sapphire Taxi.

1560
01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:40.686
"We get you there in style" -
something like that.


1561
01:06:40.719 --> 01:06:42.555
Ah.

1562
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:46.460
Are we changing
the subject now?


1563
01:06:46.493 --> 01:06:49.929
- Uh... I'm using a story...
- [Mickey] Ah.


1564
01:06:49.962 --> 01:06:53.600
...to answer your question,
but in a circuitous fashion.


1565
01:06:53.632 --> 01:06:54.968
[Mickey]
Well, carry on.


1566
01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:01.708
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


1567
01:07:01.741 --> 01:07:04.911
So I pick up
this couple.


1568
01:07:04.944 --> 01:07:06.880
They're in Scarborough.

1569
01:07:06.913 --> 01:07:08.782
They want to go
to Roncy.


1570
01:07:08.815 --> 01:07:11.051
And they're... I figure
they're brother and sister,


1571
01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:12.351
the way she is
with me -


1572
01:07:12.384 --> 01:07:15.656
sort of flirting,
smiling,


1573
01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:18.824
leaning over the...
the front seat, directing me.


1574
01:07:18.857 --> 01:07:20.326
Long hair.

1575
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.363
Open, fresh face.

1576
01:07:23.395 --> 01:07:24.697
- Finnish.
- Oh.


1577
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:28.467
Beautiful Finnish...
This beautiful Finnish accent.


1578
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.437
And somehow,
it comes up,


1579
01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:33.306
do I want to smoke
some pot with them?


1580
01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:35.007
And...

1581
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.077
I was never one to turn down
an opportunity to get high,


1582
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.513
so I say, "Sure."

1583
01:07:40.547 --> 01:07:43.050
And, uh, get
to their place.


1584
01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:46.086
It was on, um,
Fern Avenue, I believe.


1585
01:07:46.118 --> 01:07:48.888
And, uh, as soon
as we get inside,


1586
01:07:48.922 --> 01:07:50.057
he kicks off his shoes,

1587
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:52.391
puts on a laserdisc.

1588
01:07:52.424 --> 01:07:53.592
- [Mickey laughs]
- Remember laserdiscs?


1589
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:54.927
- I do.
- Yeah! [laughs]


1590
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.098
So this is, um,
Saturday Night Fever.


1591
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.565
You know that scene where...
where Travolta's


1592
01:07:59.598 --> 01:08:00.633
- walking down the sidewalk?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1593
01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.369
Bee Gees... Uh, uh...

1594

More than I can even
begin to tell you.


1913
01:25:37.021 --> 01:25:39.424
- You don't look scared.
- Well, because...


1914
01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:41.127
because I'm being the man,
and this is what the man does,


1915
01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.696
and I'll be scared...
later.


1916
01:25:46.164 --> 01:25:49.701
- When?
- I don't know.


1917
01:25:49.735 --> 01:25:50.936
When there's time.
When there...


1918
01:25:50.968 --> 01:25:53.004
When I have the time.

1919
01:25:53.038 --> 01:25:55.840
Mm. What about now?

1920
01:25:55.874 --> 01:25:58.778
What do you feel
right now?


1921
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.913
I'm sorry. Are we...
Is this an acting exercise


1922
01:26:00.945 --> 01:26:01.980
that we're doing,
or...?


1923
01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:03.516
I just want to know
how you feel.


1924
01:26:03.548 --> 01:26:05.517
I don't know. I...

1925
01:26:05.551 --> 01:26:06.886
[sighs] I'm tired.

1926
01:26:06.919 --> 01:26:08.621
Uh-huh.

1927
01:26:08.654 --> 01:26:10.790
- [Frank] My feet hurt.
- [Mel] Mm.


1928
01:26:13.725 --> 01:26:17.596
[sighs]

1929
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:19.131
You angry?

1930
01:26:19.164 --> 01:26:21.934
No. [scoffs]

1931
01:26:21.967 --> 01:26:24.703
- Am I angry?
- Well, shouldn't you be angry?


1932
01:26:24.736 --> 01:26:26.505
Well, I mean, where
in all of this


1933
01:26:26.538 --> 01:26:28.941
has there been room
for me to...


1934
01:26:28.973 --> 01:26:30.976
How about that girl, huh?

1935
01:26:31.008 --> 01:26:32.043
How about that girl?

1936
01:26:32.076 --> 01:26:33.678
What? What girl?

1937
01:26:33.712 --> 01:26:36.214
You never told me that story
about that girl in the museum,


1938
01:26:36.248 --> 01:26:37.817
- and the painting, and...
- [chuckles]


1939
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:39.485
- No, I didn't.
- What happened with that girl?


1940
01:26:39.517 --> 01:26:41.085
I...

1941
01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:42.521
What was her name,
that girl?


1942
01:26:42.553 --> 01:26:43.688
- Seriously?
- Yeah.


1943
01:26:43.722 --> 01:26:45.057
You're... You're jealous?

1944
01:26:45.089 --> 01:26:46.891
I don't know what I am.

1945
01:26:46.924 --> 01:26:49.061
[sighs]

1946
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:54.699
You know, before
the party,


1947
01:26:54.732 --> 01:26:58.536
I walked around
and I looked at...


1948
01:26:58.570 --> 01:26:59.905
every...

1949
01:26:59.937 --> 01:27:01.172
And then I had
to walk around again.


1950
01:27:01.205 --> 01:27:02.708
It was like I had
to see them all again.


1951
01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:07.679
[inhales, then pauses]

1952
01:27:07.713 --> 01:27:09.849
It was just so you.

1953
01:27:14.018 --> 01:27:16.054
My pussy.

1954
01:27:16.088 --> 01:27:18.257
[chuckles]

1955
01:27:18.289 --> 01:27:20.592
My famous pussy.

1956
01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:23.029
Yeah. Your famous pussy.

1957
01:27:33.105 --> 01:27:34.740
[softly] You must be
exhausted.


1958
01:27:34.772 --> 01:27:36.808
- Mm, so tired.
- [Frank] Come on, come on.


1959
01:27:36.842 --> 01:27:38.643
- Let's go to bed.
- [Mel] Mm.


1960
01:27:41.746 --> 01:27:43.148
[Frank]
Come on.


1961
01:27:45.182 --> 01:27:47.085
[Frank grunts loudly]

1962
01:27:47.119 --> 01:27:48.521
[Mel]
Are you okay?


1963
01:27:48.553 --> 01:27:50.054
Yeah. Me? I'm fine.

1964
01:27:50.088 --> 01:27:51.523
I'm okay.

1965
01:27:51.557 --> 01:27:52.625
Let's go to bed.

1966
01:27:52.657 --> 01:27:56.061
I'm just gonna...

1967
01:27:56.093 --> 01:27:57.730
A little bit,
and then I'll...


1968
01:27:57.762 --> 01:28:00.832
Go on. It's alright.
I'm fine. Go.


1969
01:28:00.865 --> 01:28:02.935
- Frank!
- Okay. Yeah, okay!


1970
01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:06.038
