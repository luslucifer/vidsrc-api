1
00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:05.879
Okay.

2
00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:13.120
You want to show us where
the rest of the cameras are?


3
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.992
What do you have to hide?

4
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.601
Test.

5
00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.170
You're watching a detective.

6
00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:31.805
Yeah, that's right.

7
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.027
I see you.

8
00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:04.805
Yeah, I mean you.

9
00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:05.706
What?

10
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.191
I need your badge.

11
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:37.037
Off the record, how long you
been taking police equipment?


12
00:04:52.853 --> 00:04:56.590
I'm sorry, Hood, they asked
me to take your badge.


13
00:04:56.624 --> 00:04:58.158
It wasn't my idea.

14
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.882
That's interesting.

15
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.153
Don't really know what to say.

16
00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:27.988
- You know that we're
here to talk about Tom,


17
00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:30.190
and why he is in jail under
suspicion of two murders,


18
00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:31.792
Merle James and Ray Starling.

19
00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:43.370
- I know when it comes to
murder, everyone is a suspect.


20
00:05:43.403 --> 00:05:47.608
- When did things start
to go off the rails, Hood?


21
00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.679
- My life is
perfect, isn't yours?


22
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.118
Tom.

23
00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:03.290
Hi.

24
00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:11.498
What'd you get up to today?

25
00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.011
- When you put in master
cameras at your husband's work


26
00:06:58.045 --> 00:06:59.747
and your own home, I mean
you must have some idea


27
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.150
what you were chasing
after in all this.


28
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.262
- At first, it was
just an awful feeling


29
00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:17.164
in the pit of my stomach.

30
00:07:17.197 --> 00:07:20.267
- So why didn't you just
confront Tom about Merle?


31
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.469
- Until then, I'd
never heard of Merle.


32
00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:26.707
At the time, I really didn't
know what I was looking for.


33
00:08:05.512 --> 00:08:07.547
Now I think you all can see

34
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.851
how this will benefit
the entire community.


35
00:08:10.884 --> 00:08:12.753
- You're destroying
everything I care about!


36
00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:13.854
Starling.

37
00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:16.189
Merle, come on, let's go.

38
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.526
Merle, please, come on.

39
00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:27.567
- Starling, will you talk
some sense into your girl?


40
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.102
I'm nobody's girl.

41
00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:30.871
- What was
the most striking thing


42
00:08:30.904 --> 00:08:32.773
you learned about her?

43
00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:36.844
- She was blonde, is that
what you want to know?


44
00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:38.178
You claim.

45
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:41.481
- She was very
different from me.


46
00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:42.382
How so?

47
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.555
- I guess I admired her
strong moral principles.


48
00:08:48.588 --> 00:08:51.892
- And that's why she
slept with your husband.


49
00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:53.493
Maybe.

50
00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:55.763
Don't feel so bad.

51
00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:58.766
Most marriages are
based in denial.


52
00:09:43.243 --> 00:09:45.578
Was working for Merle's dad

53
00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:48.715
the first time you
started moonlighting?


54
00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:50.450
Guess so.

55
00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:56.689
You have a thing for
the Medieval era?


56
00:09:58.158 --> 00:10:01.394
- Give me back the
Knights of the Round Table


57
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:04.131
and the search of the San Graal.

58
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:08.168
Sounds so noble.

59
00:10:10.103 --> 00:10:12.405
What would we women
do without you?


60
00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:13.306
Hmm.

61
00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:18.378
Who are they?

62
00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:24.584
- This is my daughter Merle
and my daughter Hazel.


63
00:10:24.617 --> 00:10:27.855
Have you ever tried
archery, Miss Hood?


64
00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:31.158
- It's not exactly
my weapon of choice.


65
00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:33.861
- Of course Merle's the
crack shot in the family.


66
00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.996
You must try it sometime.

67
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:43.236
- I always worry
when I see my dad


68
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.738
alone with a beautiful woman.

69
00:10:48.842 --> 00:10:50.844
This is my daughter Hazel.

70
00:10:50.878 --> 00:10:52.812
This is Sheila Hood.

71
00:10:52.846 --> 00:10:54.347
Hi.

72
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:56.516
Be nice to my father now.

73
00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:01.354
- Your father
strikes me as a man


74
00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:04.257
who knows how to
look after himself.


75
00:11:18.638 --> 00:11:21.674
- So, how can I
help you, Miss Hood?


76
00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:28.281
- I'd like to help
you, Mr. James.


77
00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:31.584
- Oh really, well how
are you going to help me?


78
00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:35.822
- I'd like to get to the bottom
of your sabotage problem.


79
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.192
And what's in it for you?

80
00:11:39.226 --> 00:11:41.761
Are you in debt, or something?

81
00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:46.466
Or is this personal?

82
00:11:48.868 --> 00:11:52.572
Of course I deal with
a lot of people but,


83
00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:56.809
I've a hunch this is something
to do with my daughter Merle.


84
00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:02.482
You see Merle is
one of those people


85
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.854
who blames everything in
the world on global warming.


86
00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:19.132
- You're too
beautiful to be a cop.


87
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.467
So, what gives?

88
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.674
By the way, what do you think
of my father, the silver fox?


89
00:12:28.908 --> 00:12:32.012
- I'm not really sure what
to think of your father.


90
00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:36.249
- Hmm, he's a man of grand
appetites and passions.


91
00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:40.420
Merle inherited
his stubbornness.


92
00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:42.655
You're lucky he likes you.

93
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.794
Watch out for Starling, though,
he's a pretty dangerous guy.


94
00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:49.862
How so?

95
00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:52.599
He's not the kind of guy who's

96
00:12:52.632 --> 00:12:56.536
particularly interested
in your nice ass.


97
00:12:56.569 --> 00:13:00.773
He's more interested in taking
advantage of your wounds.


98
00:13:02.642 --> 00:13:05.345
So what do you like about him?

99
00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:08.481
He lets me sing at his bar,

100
00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:12.219
and he likes to touch
women inappropriately.


101
00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:21.794
Aren't you going to
ask me about my sister?


102
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.364
Of course.

103
00:13:27.967 --> 00:13:30.637
If I could say anything,

104
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.206
I admire her sense of purpose.

105
00:13:35.408 --> 00:13:39.046
How she became so different
remains a mystery to me.


106
00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:40.613
How do you mean?

107
00:13:41.948 --> 00:13:44.317
She believes in something.

108
00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:49.222
Compared to Merle,
I'm pretty crass


109
00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:50.790
and materialistic.

110
00:13:58.298 --> 00:14:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen, my sister,

111
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:03.036
Merle James.

112
00:14:04.837 --> 00:14:09.008
* Lullaby of Birdland,
that's what I *


113
00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:13.012
* Always hear when you say

114
00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:17.250
* Never in my wordland could
there be ways to reveal *


115
00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:21.821
* In a phrase how I feel

116
00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:26.025
* Have you ever heard
two turtle doves *


117
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:30.263
* Bill and coo when they love

118
00:14:30.297 --> 00:14:34.501
* That's the kind of magic
music we make with our lips *


119
00:14:36.002 --> 00:14:38.605
* When we kiss

120
00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:40.907
No peeking.

121
00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:03.530
Smells like Cubans.

122
00:15:03.563 --> 00:15:04.431
Mm hmm.

123
00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.335
That's part of the story.

124
00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:33.426
Louisiana whiskey, no less.

125
00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.831
You can open your eyes now.

126
00:15:45.738 --> 00:15:48.074
The ivory-billed woodpecker.

127
00:15:48.107 --> 00:15:48.975
How?

128
00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:54.147
This is a museum piece.

129
00:15:58.651 --> 00:16:00.920
The cigar box is antique.

130
00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:07.394
It's made from the trees
they cut down in Louisiana.


131
00:16:07.427 --> 00:16:11.398
The cigar is from Cuba
where they did the same.


132
00:16:15.067 --> 00:16:16.035
I remember you telling me

133
00:16:16.068 --> 00:16:19.339
that's why the
ivory-bill went extinct.


134
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:26.145
Don't you like it?

135
00:16:46.165 --> 00:16:47.600
That was

136
00:16:47.634 --> 00:16:49.336
very touching, Hood.

137
00:16:50.803 --> 00:16:52.539
I mean, I thought you'd be
angry enough to kill a guy


138
00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:55.708
and you, you just
give him a present?


139
00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:01.614
- It was like if I could
just create something


140
00:17:01.648 --> 00:17:05.752
that I knew he loved,
maybe I could still


141
00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:08.321
somehow hold onto what we had.

142
00:17:53.966 --> 00:17:57.370
Do you have any evidence
yet that it is sabotage?


143
00:17:57.404 --> 00:17:58.271
None.

144
00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:02.174
Other than damage
from the fires.


145
00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:04.911
But I also have this.

146
00:18:06.546 --> 00:18:09.582
Life is full of
inexplicable things.


147
00:18:12.251 --> 00:18:14.621
Someone sent these to you?

148
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.199
- Now I should tell you
Merle was having an affair


149
00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:30.603
which led to her breaking
off her engagement


150
00:18:30.637 --> 00:18:32.505
with Raymond Starling.

151
00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:43.816
Go ahead, shoot me.

152
00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:55.187
Now point it up just a little.

153
00:19:56.122 --> 00:19:57.557
Good.

154
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.459
Now release the arrow.

155
00:20:03.396 --> 00:20:04.263
Let it go.

156
00:20:11.003 --> 00:20:13.039
Not bad for a first try.

157
00:20:14.373 --> 00:20:16.242
Only with your help.

158
00:20:17.444 --> 00:20:18.711
- I'm just gonna go
make a phone call,


159
00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:22.949
why don't you go get the
arrows, I'll be right back.


160
00:21:21.974 --> 00:21:23.843
Poor thing.

161
00:21:24.877 --> 00:21:29.081
Ah, he looks so peaceful,
but he died so violently.


162
00:21:34.253 --> 00:21:35.688
Mm hmm, mm hmm.

163
00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:39.358
Yeah?

164
00:21:39.391 --> 00:21:40.860
Yeah, it's good.

165
00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:42.228
What?

166
00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:43.563
Let's go.

167
00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:44.463
What?

168
00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:47.767
Nothing, it's...

169
00:21:50.503 --> 00:21:51.470
Your pictures, it's like

170
00:21:51.504 --> 00:21:54.874
you're photographic a
crime scene, you know?


171
00:21:57.476 --> 00:21:59.011
Oh, for real then?

172
00:22:05.952 --> 00:22:07.419
Hey, come here.

173
00:22:08.454 --> 00:22:11.123
This one's still breathing.

174
00:22:11.157 --> 00:22:15.094
- Birds don't
understand windows.


175
00:22:15.127 --> 00:22:16.796
We should put it
out of its misery.


176
00:22:16.829 --> 00:22:17.697
No!

177
00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:23.770
No, we need to take him
to the wildlife center.


178
00:22:23.803 --> 00:22:25.071
- What
was going on with


179
00:22:25.104 --> 00:22:27.506
this whole dead bird thing?

180
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.010
- We were bird
rescue volunteers,


181
00:22:31.043 --> 00:22:32.745
looking for stunned
or injured birds


182
00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:34.647
that had collided
with buildings.


183
00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:38.551
I tagged along, documenting
the deaths because


184
00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:42.254
it was something we
could do together.


185
00:22:42.288 --> 00:22:44.256
Hmm, sounds intimate.

186
00:23:30.803 --> 00:23:32.705
- They say the spirit
of King Arthur is alive


187
00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:35.441
in any old crow that flies back.

188
00:23:42.114 --> 00:23:45.317
- You always get that
worked up over dead birds?


189
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:48.320
Thought that was
more of a Tom thing.


190
00:23:48.354 --> 00:23:52.859
- I was brought up to believe
in the sanctity of life.


191
00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:54.260
If you say so.

192
00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:56.829
So what was going
on in your marriage


193
00:23:56.863 --> 00:23:59.732
before all this
started to happen?


194
00:24:20.853 --> 00:24:22.154
What's wrong?

195
00:24:22.989 --> 00:24:24.290
Wait.

196
00:24:24.323 --> 00:24:25.858
What's that noise?

197
00:28:04.143 --> 00:28:05.077
Tom?

198
00:28:05.111 --> 00:28:06.212
Yeah.

199
00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:07.179
Baby?

200
00:28:07.213 --> 00:28:08.580
I'm in the kitchen.

201
00:28:08.614 --> 00:28:09.415
Hey.

202
00:28:09.448 --> 00:28:10.649
Hey hey hey hey hey.

203
00:28:10.682 --> 00:28:12.284
You gotta see this.

204
00:28:13.319 --> 00:28:14.453
Check it out.

205
00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:17.189
Oh my God, you're bleeding.

206
00:28:17.223 --> 00:28:18.257
No.

207
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.091
You gotta see this.

208
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:19.992
You're bleeding.

209
00:28:20.026 --> 00:28:21.260
Wait wait wait.

210
00:28:21.293 --> 00:28:22.594
Look at this, I
got it right here.


211
00:28:22.628 --> 00:28:23.429
Look at me, look at me.

212
00:28:23.462 --> 00:28:24.263
- Wait, wait.
- Look at me!


213
00:28:24.296 --> 00:28:27.233
- Just hang on,
you gotta see this.


214
00:28:27.266 --> 00:28:28.834
Okay.

215
00:28:28.867 --> 00:28:30.502
See this riot cop

216
00:28:30.536 --> 00:28:32.504
hits me with his baton.

217
00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:36.475
- What the fuck are you
doing hitting a cop?


218
00:28:36.508 --> 00:28:38.577
You should have been there.

219
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.947
We were protesting
Futron Energy.


220
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.015
The same assholes
sponsoring your exhibit


221
00:28:43.049 --> 00:28:46.352
produce the oil equivalent of
a quarter of a million tons


222
00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:48.554
of carbon dioxide a day.

223
00:28:48.587 --> 00:28:52.791
Baby, we've been living
with our heads in the sand.


224
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.327
You're blonde.

225
00:28:56.762 --> 00:29:01.267
- At first she seemed to be
strictly interested in Starling.


226
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.836
Maybe the word
stalker is too strong?


227
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.239
But she had a pretty
unhealthy preoccupation


228
00:29:07.273 --> 00:29:09.141
with my sister, Merle.

229
00:29:24.156 --> 00:29:27.593
- I have no idea what
she wanted from me.


230
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.928
But to be honest,

231
00:29:31.297 --> 00:29:34.900
I think she may have
wanted to blackmail me.


232
00:29:34.933 --> 00:29:36.102
They're lying.

233
00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:37.836
We'll get to that later.

234
00:29:37.869 --> 00:29:38.837
When did you first come across

235
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.872
the guy in the cowboy
hat, what's his name?


236
00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:42.674
Bob McIntyre.

237
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.744
- So as part of your
investigation for Mr. James,


238
00:29:45.777 --> 00:29:48.180
he had you follow Tom and Merle

239
00:29:48.214 --> 00:29:50.482
to his fracking
operations, right?


240
00:29:50.516 --> 00:29:51.383
Yeah.

241
00:30:06.398 --> 00:30:07.333
- And the
guy in the cowboy hat,


242
00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:08.767
that, that's Bob McIntyre?

243
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.601
Bob McIntyre.

244
00:30:09.635 --> 00:30:10.436
Right.

245
00:30:10.469 --> 00:30:11.570
What do you think?

246
00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:15.774
Do you think Tom and Merle
were doing the sabotaging?


247
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.541
You know when that was taken?

248
00:31:22.574 --> 00:31:23.442
Sure.

249
00:31:25.077 --> 00:31:25.977
Yeah, not really.

250
00:31:26.011 --> 00:31:27.479
I don't know, obviously
before Merle died.


251
00:31:27.513 --> 00:31:28.647
You know, you just
always seem like


252
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.816
you're enjoying your job.

253
00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:33.319
- Do you know they
say that men and women


254
00:31:33.352 --> 00:31:36.322
think about sex
every seven seconds,


255
00:31:36.355 --> 00:31:39.458
it's just like.

256
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:41.093
12,000 times a day.

257
00:31:42.094 --> 00:31:44.263
- What is that, your new
favorite pickup line?


258
00:31:44.296 --> 00:31:45.264
No, just,

259
00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:48.467
an interesting statistic.

260
00:32:01.313 --> 00:32:03.849
Everyone has a breaking point.

261
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.752
Me for instance,

262
00:32:06.785 --> 00:32:08.254
I don't think I could
handle watching my wife


263
00:32:08.287 --> 00:32:11.590
do lines off some
naked dude in my bed.


264
00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:22.801
Get the fuck out of here.

265
00:32:22.834 --> 00:32:24.670
- Tom is suspected of
committing two murders,


266
00:32:24.703 --> 00:32:27.206
but if I didn't know you,

267
00:32:27.239 --> 00:32:30.041
I'd say you'd be
a prime suspect.


268
00:33:33.071 --> 00:33:35.207
Did you ever meet her?

269
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:36.107
No.

270
00:33:37.243 --> 00:33:39.110
I just surveilled her.

271
00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:47.986
- Hey.
- Hey.


272
00:33:50.155 --> 00:33:51.357
Top up?

273
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.424
Hmm, yeah.

274
00:33:55.861 --> 00:33:58.063
What are you looking at?

275
00:33:59.097 --> 00:34:00.899
Is this a new ring?

276
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:02.868
No.

277
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:05.170
No, it was my great-aunt's.

278
00:34:05.203 --> 00:34:06.405
I don't usually wear it,

279
00:34:06.438 --> 00:34:08.540
but are you sure you've
never seen it before?


280
00:34:08.574 --> 00:34:11.743
Aren't we supposed
to be married?


281
00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:14.045
- It was familiar, I
just didn't recognize it.


282
00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:17.148
- I guess there's a lot we
don't know about each other.


283
00:34:17.182 --> 00:34:17.983
Sorry, what?

284
00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:18.817
Hmm?

285
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:19.718
What?

286
00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:24.022
- See, you're not
even listening.


287
00:34:24.055 --> 00:34:28.260
Always busy working late with
your dinosaurs and your birds.


288
00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:30.896
I heard you.

289
00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.131
It's your great-aunt's ring.

290
00:34:33.164 --> 00:34:34.032
I like it.

291
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.134
Thank you.

292
00:35:10.736 --> 00:35:12.871
"Forget me not."

293
00:35:12.904 --> 00:35:15.574
- Maybe this is all a
case of cherchez la femme.


294
00:35:15.607 --> 00:35:17.443
Look, you know Tom.

295
00:35:17.476 --> 00:35:19.911
He's a mild-mannered
ornithologist.


296
00:35:19.945 --> 00:35:21.547
- Yeah, but I think
that maybe Tom started


297
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.316
to feel protective over Merle.

298
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.852
Maybe it was a
jealous rage, or a,


299
00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:30.722
a sudden dose of
testosterone just kicking in.


300
00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:31.723
Hey!

301
00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:33.992
- His motive, if you can
categorize it as such,


302
00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:35.060
was self-defense.

303
00:35:35.093 --> 00:35:36.862
- If Tom killed Starling
in self-defense,


304
00:35:36.895 --> 00:35:38.564
why wouldn't you just call
the police right away?


305
00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:39.531
I don't know!

306
00:35:39.565 --> 00:35:40.732
Panic?

307
00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:42.468
Embarrassment?

308
00:35:42.501 --> 00:35:44.603
Maybe we just needed a
little time to process


309
00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:45.871
what had just happened.

310
00:35:45.904 --> 00:35:47.072
We?

311
00:35:47.105 --> 00:35:49.608
You know what I mean.

312
00:35:49.641 --> 00:35:51.977
- This is more like a
case of I will repay you.


313
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.979
- You know that the average
person is caught on camera


314
00:35:54.012 --> 00:35:55.414
over 300 times a day.

315
00:35:55.447 --> 00:35:56.482
It doesn't mean the whole truth

316
00:35:56.515 --> 00:35:58.417
about their lives is exposed.

317
00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.252
- Doesn't explain
Tom's behavior.


318
00:36:04.022 --> 00:36:06.592
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

319
00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:07.726
Baby.

320
00:36:07.759 --> 00:36:10.362
- It's like watching the
hour a dog turns into a wolf.


321
00:36:10.396 --> 00:36:11.530
This isn't a black hole, Hood.

322
00:36:11.563 --> 00:36:13.465
If that isn't motivation,
I don't know what is.


323
00:36:13.499 --> 00:36:14.600
This is over.

324
00:36:17.736 --> 00:36:20.238
You know, I'm mystified
as to how you can defend


325
00:36:20.271 --> 00:36:23.742
somebody who betrayed
you so deeply.


326
00:36:23.775 --> 00:36:25.911
If it was me, I'd be
calling my lawyer right now.


327
00:36:25.944 --> 00:36:27.913
- I'm not sure it's
really possible


328
00:36:27.946 --> 00:36:31.182
for you to fully understand
what happened here.


329
00:36:31.216 --> 00:36:34.285
- Remind me again why you
have all this weird creepy


330
00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:35.921
dead stuff in your house.

331
00:36:37.556 --> 00:36:38.724
You'd have to ask Tom.

332
00:36:38.757 --> 00:36:40.892
Tom, babe, why do
we have so much


333
00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:43.094
creepy dead stuff in our house?

334
00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:45.363
It's my job, asshole.

335
00:36:45.397 --> 00:36:48.266
- I don't know, when we
first started dating,


336
00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:51.970
we spent oh half our time
looking at dead things.


337
00:36:52.003 --> 00:36:55.040
Now we have a freezer
full of birds.


338
00:36:56.374 --> 00:36:57.409
Here you go.

339
00:36:57.443 --> 00:37:00.546
Hey guys, give me a
second, I forgot something.


340
00:37:00.579 --> 00:37:02.180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


341
00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:06.852
You guys ready?

342
00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:09.655
The piece de resistance.

343
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:14.025
What are those?

344
00:37:15.193 --> 00:37:16.061
These

345
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.632
are roasted beetle larvae.

346
00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:22.468
Right?

347
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:23.902
- Yeah, you know I hear
that beetle protein


348
00:37:23.935 --> 00:37:25.270
is going to save the world.

349
00:37:25.303 --> 00:37:26.171
Yeah.

350
00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:28.073
Sheila?

351
00:37:28.907 --> 00:37:31.209
Come on, you gotta try one.

352
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:36.682
Aw, you two should have kids.

353
00:37:39.217 --> 00:37:41.419
- No, I would
never bring a child


354
00:37:41.453 --> 00:37:44.823
into the world in
its current state.


355
00:37:44.856 --> 00:37:45.791
Uh, okay.

356
00:37:47.993 --> 00:37:49.561
You've never said that before.

357
00:37:49.595 --> 00:37:53.031
- I've certainly voiced my
reservations, my reluctance.


358
00:37:53.064 --> 00:37:54.099
- Yeah, I know, but
you've never said it


359
00:37:54.132 --> 00:37:55.901
like that before, like
you'd never do it.


360
00:37:55.934 --> 00:37:57.168
- Well, I just
don't to bring kids


361
00:37:57.202 --> 00:37:58.704
for not doing what
I want in life.


362
00:37:58.737 --> 00:38:00.606
Okay, you know what?

363
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.725
Come on.

364
00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:20.892
- No, no, I don't dance.
- Dance with me, come on.


365
00:38:20.926 --> 00:38:21.827
I don't dance.

366
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.728
Oh, God.

367
00:38:23.795 --> 00:38:26.732
- Come on, detective,
on your feet.


368
00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:31.436
See?

369
00:38:49.187 --> 00:38:50.488
Check this out.

370
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.768
- Oh,
what are you doing?


371
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:03.669
Shh.

372
00:39:06.538 --> 00:39:07.438
Why are you up there?

373
00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:13.044
What are you doing?

374
00:39:15.714 --> 00:39:18.917
- Let's see what
these puppies can do.


375
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:28.359
You can rewind and pause it.

376
00:39:30.295 --> 00:39:31.429
Sorry you gotta see this.

377
00:39:31.462 --> 00:39:33.298
I was just so,

378
00:39:33.331 --> 00:39:36.134
showing him some new cameras.

379
00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:37.035
See?

380
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.138
Bird's eye view.

381
00:40:53.078 --> 00:40:54.445
Hmm.

382
00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:55.781
Your wife, yes?

383
00:41:00.018 --> 00:41:02.620
You remember me, don't you Tom?

384
00:41:03.889 --> 00:41:04.856
John James.

385
00:41:08.226 --> 00:41:10.628
Yes of course, Mr. James.

386
00:41:10.662 --> 00:41:12.297
How can I help you?

387
00:41:16.467 --> 00:41:20.672
- I hear my daughter has been
speaking with you lately, Tom.


388
00:41:21.907 --> 00:41:24.109
Don't worry, I understand.

389
00:41:25.343 --> 00:41:27.545
I was married once myself.

390
00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:35.653
You know, Futron Energy has a
lot invested in this exhibit.


391
00:41:45.163 --> 00:41:48.700
- I'm just an
ornithologist, doing my job.


392
00:41:50.235 --> 00:41:52.537
Are you sure ornithology

393
00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.673
is all you've been
doing lately, Tom?


394
00:42:01.012 --> 00:42:03.014
- Bet some weird things
just started to appear


395
00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:06.584
when you turned on
that camera of yours.


396
00:42:06.617 --> 00:42:08.486
End of times, I guess.

397
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.994
Did Tom ever make mention of
Mr. James coming to visit him?


398
00:42:17.428 --> 00:42:18.296
Yeah.

399
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.000
He was upset, shaken really.

400
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:25.737
What did he say exactly?

401
00:42:25.771 --> 00:42:29.140
- I remember he went on
about how the oil industry


402
00:42:29.174 --> 00:42:31.609
represented the end
of civilization,


403
00:42:31.642 --> 00:42:35.847
how we should all just leave
fossil fuels in the ground.


404
00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:38.216
And he talked about
pulling the plug


405
00:42:38.249 --> 00:42:40.451
on Mr. James' sponsorship.

406
00:42:41.552 --> 00:42:43.154
- Well, Merle must have
had a lot of faith in Tom.


407
00:42:43.188 --> 00:42:44.155
I mean, do you think Tom had

408
00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:45.891
that kind of power
at the museum?


409
00:42:45.924 --> 00:42:48.293
- Oh, he was
well-regarded there.


410
00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:51.629
And they had to be seen as not
sanitizing dirty oil money.


411
00:42:51.662 --> 00:42:54.065
- I can't help but think it's
something more than that.


412
00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:55.967
What makes you say that?

413
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:57.468
The body count.

414
00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:04.175
When did you first have a hunch

415
00:43:04.209 --> 00:43:06.845
she was hiding things from you?

416
00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:13.618
I have to ask this.

417
00:43:13.651 --> 00:43:16.187
Were you guys into any
kinky S and M types stuff?


418
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:17.823
Because there are
pictures that suggest...


419
00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:18.957
No.

420
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.325
- How do you just
keep it to yourself?


421
00:43:20.358 --> 00:43:24.229
I mean, how does a happily
married man like Tom


422
00:43:24.262 --> 00:43:26.131
succumb to a woman like Merle?

423
00:43:26.164 --> 00:43:27.899
I don't know.

424
00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:30.001
Why do birds sing?

425
00:43:30.035 --> 00:43:31.569
I guess they found
a common cause.


426
00:43:31.602 --> 00:43:35.773
- I know, we are the fucking
world, I get it, thanks.


427
00:43:35.807 --> 00:43:36.875
- Do you know everything
that's going on


428
00:43:36.908 --> 00:43:39.845
inside of your
wife's head, Calvin?


429
00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:43.614
- I know that if you put
a piece of raw sirloin


430
00:43:43.648 --> 00:43:47.318
in front of my dog,
he can't resist it.


431
00:43:47.352 --> 00:43:48.319
Fuck you.

432
00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:56.261
- When were you first
made aware of Merle's death?


433
00:43:56.294 --> 00:43:57.728
- We were at home
when the phone rang.


434
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.302
Is everything okay?

435
00:44:10.976 --> 00:44:11.843
What?

436
00:44:13.144 --> 00:44:16.547
He told me an
ex-girlfriend had died.


437
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:18.283
- I guess by
then Tom was accustomed


438
00:44:18.316 --> 00:44:20.185
to avoiding the truth.

439
00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:17.475
Listen to this.

440
00:45:18.409 --> 00:45:19.945
Look what I found.

441
00:45:24.515 --> 00:45:25.917
This is a definitive recording

442
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:27.552
of an ivory-billed woodpecker
take at close range


443
00:45:27.585 --> 00:45:29.387
in 1935 in Louisiana.

444
00:45:46.604 --> 00:45:48.539
You should record me.

445
00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:58.116
If I died, wouldn't
you go to my funeral?


446
00:46:00.952 --> 00:46:02.420
You're not her.

447
00:46:03.454 --> 00:46:05.390
I don't care about her.

448
00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:09.961
It's like I said, I
don't want the past


449
00:46:09.995 --> 00:46:11.862
tainting our marriage.

450
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:13.798
Right.

451
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.734
- Is this really why
you're saying it like that?


452
00:46:16.767 --> 00:46:17.802
No, just I

453
00:46:18.803 --> 00:46:22.507
really don't understand
why you wouldn't go.


454
00:46:28.613 --> 00:46:30.948
It's embarrassing.

455
00:46:30.982 --> 00:46:32.683
It's embarrassing?

456
00:46:34.185 --> 00:46:37.088
What, what's
embarrassing, I am?


457
00:46:37.122 --> 00:46:39.157
Death is embarrassing.

458
00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:17.095
You know what these are?

459
00:47:17.128 --> 00:47:18.696
These are tiny bits
of Merle's body


460
00:47:18.729 --> 00:47:20.898
found at one of
the crime scenes.


461
00:47:20.931 --> 00:47:23.668
In this case, the museum.

462
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:26.604
- Tom always says our
DNA is like a scrapbook


463
00:47:26.637 --> 00:47:29.006
of our history as a species.

464
00:47:30.608 --> 00:47:34.612
We've got everything from avian
flu and ancient sex viruses,


465
00:47:34.645 --> 00:47:38.849
non-human beings, even bug
shit, right in our blood stream.


466
00:47:41.752 --> 00:47:43.788
Is that what Tom says?

467
00:47:45.456 --> 00:47:49.360
- Four billion years of
death product in our DNA.


468
00:47:49.394 --> 00:47:52.430
Our mortality is mapped out.

469
00:47:52.463 --> 00:47:54.599
We're programmed to die.

470
00:47:54.632 --> 00:47:58.002
- Welcome to the
human race, hon.


471
00:47:58.035 --> 00:47:59.670
- I think sometime soon
we'll be able to change


472
00:47:59.704 --> 00:48:01.772
our physical makeup
and live a lot longer,


473
00:48:01.806 --> 00:48:05.176
you know, like God does in the
Bible with his hands in clay.


474
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.677
- Well, I sure the
fuck hope you're right


475
00:48:06.711 --> 00:48:09.480
and that one day you get
to come back as a sponge


476
00:48:09.514 --> 00:48:11.416
or some blue fucking
algae and live to be


477
00:48:11.449 --> 00:48:14.152
a thousand years
old, but right now,


478
00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:17.522
I'm interested in knowing
if we're to scan Tom's DNA,


479
00:48:17.555 --> 00:48:19.324
will we be able to
tell future generations


480
00:48:19.357 --> 00:48:22.727
that he killed someone
in a fit of rage?


481
00:48:41.846 --> 00:48:44.449
I mean, the jury is still
out on Starling's murder but


482
00:48:44.482 --> 00:48:47.618
Tom is implicated in
Merle's death as well.


483
00:48:47.652 --> 00:48:48.519
God.

484
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.794
Oh fuck.

485
00:48:58.796 --> 00:49:02.667
- I don't get how you
can still cover for him.


486
00:49:07.172 --> 00:49:08.606
Did Tom say anything
when he came home


487
00:49:08.639 --> 00:49:11.242
from dinner that night like

488
00:49:11.276 --> 00:49:13.311
"don't worry your
pretty little head, hon,


489
00:49:13.344 --> 00:49:15.680
"but I stuck my
mistress in a freezer


490
00:49:15.713 --> 00:49:18.383
"with a bunch of
dead fucking birds."


491
00:49:27.225 --> 00:49:28.092
Hey.

492
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.462
For fuck's sake, Hood,
come on, we're cops.


493
00:49:31.496 --> 00:49:33.331
How the fuck do you explain
part of Merle's body


494
00:49:33.364 --> 00:49:36.234
ending up in Tom's
fridge at work?


495
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:48.646
Can you at least explain to me

496
00:49:48.679 --> 00:49:51.916
these fucking flesh eating bugs?

497
00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:54.719
- They're called
dermestid beetles.


498
00:49:54.752 --> 00:49:56.020
They're useful in cleaning bones

499
00:49:56.053 --> 00:49:58.923
in full skeletons for
scientific preparations.


500
00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:02.193
- Well, that's good for
getting rid of evidence, right?


501
00:50:02.227 --> 00:50:04.395
You went to an archery
range with Hazel.


502
00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:06.264
Not bad for a first try.

503
00:50:06.297 --> 00:50:08.098
- Why do they
call it a bull's eye?


504
00:50:08.132 --> 00:50:09.834
- If you hit a
charging bull in the eye,


505
00:50:09.867 --> 00:50:11.802
the arrow goes right
through the eye socket


506
00:50:11.836 --> 00:50:14.205
and into the brain
without hitting bone.


507
00:50:14.239 --> 00:50:17.508
- You put Merle in
the golden bullseye.


508
00:50:20.678 --> 00:50:23.714
How many points do
you get for that?


509
00:50:28.152 --> 00:50:31.121
- I still think it's obvious
someone had it in for Tom.


510
00:50:31.155 --> 00:50:33.891
- Now you're starting to sound
like a conspiracy theorist.


511
00:50:33.924 --> 00:50:37.194
No, I believe Oswald did it.

512
00:50:37.228 --> 00:50:40.865
- Where were you
the night that Merle died?


513
00:50:40.898 --> 00:50:42.833
- I was at home
watching TV, detective.


514
00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:44.369
- Oh, good, so you
have someone who can


515
00:50:44.402 --> 00:50:46.337
corroborate your alibi.

516
00:50:51.876 --> 00:50:55.413
So, we got this footage
from Starling's camera.


517
00:50:55.446 --> 00:50:57.214
You didn't tell us that
this was the last night


518
00:50:57.248 --> 00:50:59.784
you saw Merle before she died.

519
00:51:09.126 --> 00:51:13.097
- I tracked down images of
Merle's movements that day.


520
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:14.799
It seemed like just another

521
00:51:14.832 --> 00:51:18.035
fairly ordinary day
in someone's life.


522
00:51:25.576 --> 00:51:29.447
- Arriving at
Flosdale, Flosdale station.


523
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.668
- When did Starling
come into the picture?


524
00:52:23.701 --> 00:52:27.838
- I first really noticed
him at Merle's memorial.


525
00:53:27.131 --> 00:53:31.736
- Aren't you going to
sing Lullaby of Birdland?


526
00:53:31.769 --> 00:53:32.570
You're drunk.

527
00:53:32.603 --> 00:53:34.605
Aw, come on, Hazel.

528
00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:36.774
Sing it for Merle!

529
00:53:36.807 --> 00:53:39.510
Who the hell invited you here?

530
00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.714
You're dead.

531
00:53:46.283 --> 00:53:48.385
Roy, get him out of here.

532
00:53:49.554 --> 00:53:50.588
Oh please.

533
00:53:51.822 --> 00:53:53.157
Don't touch me.

534
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.492
Don't touch me!

535
00:53:54.525 --> 00:53:55.392
Stop it.

536
00:53:59.363 --> 00:54:00.397
I see you!

537
00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:06.804
I'll have a whiskey neat.

538
00:54:30.828 --> 00:54:34.064
- You look familiar, have I
seen you somewhere before?


539
00:54:34.098 --> 00:54:35.132
I don't think so.

540
00:54:35.165 --> 00:54:37.067
Keep your voice down.

541
00:54:37.101 --> 00:54:37.968
Why?

542
00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:41.405
You think we're being watched.

543
00:54:41.438 --> 00:54:43.340
- Well, I learned how
to spot a cop in a crowd


544
00:54:43.373 --> 00:54:44.675
when I was very young.

545
00:54:44.709 --> 00:54:45.510
Oh, is that right?

546
00:54:45.543 --> 00:54:47.044
What's the secret?

547
00:54:47.077 --> 00:54:50.014
- The olive stripes
in their pants.


548
00:54:56.554 --> 00:54:58.255
Who's your friend?

549
00:54:59.557 --> 00:55:01.859
- I'm not sure,
we only just met.


550
00:55:01.892 --> 00:55:03.260
Sheila Hood.

551
00:55:03.293 --> 00:55:06.196
My husband knew
your sister Merle.


552
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.097
How did you know Merle?

553
00:55:07.131 --> 00:55:08.065
- Well, I didn't
really know Merle,


554
00:55:08.098 --> 00:55:10.535
but like I said my husband did.

555
00:55:10.568 --> 00:55:11.702
And who's your husband?

556
00:55:11.736 --> 00:55:13.003
Tom Kale.

557
00:55:13.037 --> 00:55:15.339
He used to go out with her.

558
00:55:19.944 --> 00:55:24.081
- Don't worry, he doesn't
know our little secret.


559
00:55:31.421 --> 00:55:32.590
You've have to excuse her.

560
00:55:32.623 --> 00:55:36.326
She's not deal with
Merle's death very well.


561
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:41.632
So tell me, um,

562
00:55:44.802 --> 00:55:46.470
what would an attractive
woman like you


563
00:55:46.503 --> 00:55:50.374
be doing with a guy with
a name like Tom Kale?


564
00:55:51.942 --> 00:55:53.711
- You know what, I
think I gotta go.


565
00:55:53.744 --> 00:55:55.212
No.

566
00:55:55.245 --> 00:55:56.113
You stay.

567
00:55:57.414 --> 00:55:58.716
Another time.

568
00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:03.754
- As a cop,
why do you get involved


569
00:56:03.788 --> 00:56:06.423
with a known criminal
like Starling?


570
00:56:06.456 --> 00:56:10.060
- I thought he would
lead me to a solution.


571
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:23.273
Starling did have an unhealthy
preoccupation with Tom.


572
00:56:32.116 --> 00:56:35.452
- Make sure you wear that
kimono when you see Tom.


573
00:56:35.485 --> 00:56:37.888
- Starling hired you,
right, to do what?


574
00:56:37.922 --> 00:56:39.156
Investigate Merle's death.

575
00:56:39.189 --> 00:56:40.290
- Okay, but don't
you find that crazy,


576
00:56:40.324 --> 00:56:42.359
because what Mr. James
had already hired you.


577
00:56:42.392 --> 00:56:43.761
Did Starling know that?

578
00:56:43.794 --> 00:56:46.296
- Starling never really
mentioned Mr. James.


579
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.197
I think

580
00:56:48.232 --> 00:56:49.700
I was trying to see
where all this was going.


581
00:56:49.734 --> 00:56:51.869
I think he just wanted to
use me to fuck with Tom.


582
00:56:51.902 --> 00:56:52.770
How so?

583
00:56:55.172 --> 00:56:56.974
- Maybe he thought that Tom
and Merle shared something


584
00:56:57.007 --> 00:56:58.275
that he and she never did.

585
00:56:58.308 --> 00:57:02.012
Maybe he felt like he
lost control over her.


586
00:57:13.223 --> 00:57:17.427
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
drop in on you like this.


587
00:57:20.064 --> 00:57:24.268
You were one of the few
people Merle ever trusted.


588
00:57:27.404 --> 00:57:30.440
- Merle never really
trusted anyone.


589
00:57:36.013 --> 00:57:39.449
- So this is what all
the fuss was about.


590
00:57:43.253 --> 00:57:44.121
Yeah.

591
00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:49.159
I'm trying to show that

592
00:57:49.193 --> 00:57:51.595
birds didn't descent directly
from the theropod dinosaurs


593
00:57:51.628 --> 00:57:55.599
but likely the small,
reptilian thecodonts


594
00:57:55.632 --> 00:57:59.336
that roamed the earth

595
00:58:02.639 --> 00:58:04.675
Wow, is that like the,

596
00:58:06.176 --> 00:58:07.044
arc,

597
00:58:10.514 --> 00:58:11.548
archaeopteryx?

598
00:58:11.581 --> 00:58:12.950
Archaeopteryx.

599
00:58:15.886 --> 00:58:20.691
- That's all I can remember
from my natural science class.


600
00:58:20.725 --> 00:58:22.192
That's not bad.

601
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:36.406
- I think my sister's
intentions were good.


602
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.876
My dad as much as he loved Merle

603
00:58:38.909 --> 00:58:42.112
thought she had lost
her way and perhaps


604
00:58:42.146 --> 00:58:44.414
was a bad influence on you.

605
00:58:48.218 --> 00:58:50.921
He really likes you, by the way.

606
00:58:54.658 --> 00:58:58.262
He thinks you're doing
important work here.


607
00:59:30.727 --> 00:59:31.595
Hmm.

608
01:00:11.535 --> 01:00:13.303
Are you an actress?

609
01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:17.774
- Well, that's a
tawdry pickup line.


610
01:00:17.808 --> 01:00:19.776
- I only meant there's
something superficial


611
01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:21.946
and insincere about you.

612
01:00:21.979 --> 01:00:23.013
Oh.

613
01:00:23.047 --> 01:00:26.050
You're not who you seem to be.

614
01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:27.284
- Well, you already
know I'm a cop


615
01:00:27.317 --> 01:00:31.521
but sometimes I like to
moonlight as a private eye.


616
01:00:33.757 --> 01:00:37.962
- You know, I never guessed
you'd be back so soon.


617
01:00:40.297 --> 01:00:42.699
Hazel exudes a certain
seductive quality,


618
01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:44.134
wouldn't you agree?

619
01:00:44.168 --> 01:00:46.803
She is a very beautiful girl.

620
01:00:46.837 --> 01:00:48.605
You got that right.

621
01:01:03.888 --> 01:01:07.958
* Lullaby by birdland
that's what I *


622
01:01:07.992 --> 01:01:12.262
* Always hear, when you sigh

623
01:01:12.296 --> 01:01:16.500
* Never in my wordland could
there be ways to reveal *


624
01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:20.938
* In a phrase how I feel

625
01:01:20.971 --> 01:01:25.175
- How did you get into the
crime fighting business?


626
01:01:26.476 --> 01:01:29.746
- To be perfectly
honest, crime bores me.


627
01:01:29.779 --> 01:01:32.749
I'd rather be
photographing nature.


628
01:01:35.185 --> 01:01:37.955
* When we kiss

629
01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:41.425
* And there's
a weepy old willow *


630
01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:42.993
Crime is nature.

631
01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:50.600
* That's how I'd
cry in my pillow *


632
01:01:50.634 --> 01:01:54.838
* If you should tell
me farewell and goodbye *


633
01:01:56.706 --> 01:01:57.574
So,

634
01:01:59.076 --> 01:02:02.412
you get off watching
people's deep dark secrets.


635
01:02:02.446 --> 01:02:04.982
Watching is my line of work.

636
01:02:08.052 --> 01:02:09.586
What do you see?

637
01:02:16.126 --> 01:02:16.994
'Cause um,

638
01:02:18.428 --> 01:02:20.297
you know what I think?

639
01:02:23.467 --> 01:02:27.671
I think you been thinking about
me a lot since we last met.


640
01:02:30.374 --> 01:02:32.076
Touch my dick.

641
01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:34.878
Seriously.

642
01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:41.218
Touch my dick.

643
01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:53.830
Relax, I just wanted to
see we could work together.


644
01:02:55.565 --> 01:02:56.433
Now.

645
01:03:00.804 --> 01:03:03.507
Let's find out who killed Merle.

646
01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:19.556
- You never told me
you'd been to Japan.


647
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.133
Were you in love with her?

648
01:03:33.737 --> 01:03:35.505
She's very beautiful.

649
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:41.411
- It's really not
that important, it


650
01:03:41.445 --> 01:03:43.313
It's before I met you.

651
01:03:45.182 --> 01:03:47.017
Where'd you find this?

652
01:03:48.052 --> 01:03:50.187
I went to her memorial.

653
01:03:51.755 --> 01:03:55.625
I thought someone should
represent the family.


654
01:04:03.133 --> 01:04:04.000
I thought we talked about

655
01:04:04.034 --> 01:04:07.071
not having secrets
in this marriage.


656
01:04:10.707 --> 01:04:12.109
What's worse than anything is

657
01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:15.179
you've been keeping
yourself secret.


658
01:04:52.949 --> 01:04:54.484
Come on.

659
01:04:55.719 --> 01:04:59.022
- What is his
fucking problem?


660
01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:00.257
Who?

661
01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:01.258
Bird boy.

662
01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:06.062
- Don't worry about it,
I'm taking care of him.


663
01:05:06.096 --> 01:05:07.764
I fucking hope so.

664
01:05:07.797 --> 01:05:11.935
If it wasn't for him,
Merle would still be alive.


665
01:05:12.836 --> 01:05:15.205
Do you like to tango, Tom?

666
01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:20.244
I can show you the secret.

667
01:05:21.378 --> 01:05:25.081
All the mystery that
lives below our waists.


668
01:05:27.184 --> 01:05:28.252
- I feel like I need
to tell you that


669
01:05:28.285 --> 01:05:31.221
I have to turn down your
father's sponsorship offer.


670
01:05:31.255 --> 01:05:35.459
- Mm, babe, is that the only
reason you came to see me?


671
01:05:37.527 --> 01:05:38.462
In a way,

672
01:05:39.629 --> 01:05:42.432
I feel like I'm honoring
Merle's last wishes,


673
01:05:42.466 --> 01:05:46.303
but I think it's even
bigger than Merle.


674
01:05:46.336 --> 01:05:49.038
I know what you did, you know.

675
01:05:52.442 --> 01:05:53.310
Boom.

676
01:05:57.381 --> 01:05:59.649
You've been a bad boy, Tom.

677
01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:04.354
I can make you feel better.

678
01:06:15.165 --> 01:06:16.533
I did nothing.

679
01:06:20.704 --> 01:06:21.571
I know.

680
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:27.377
I know.

681
01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.548
I know.

682
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.720
- I think this is what
you're looking for.


683
01:06:36.753 --> 01:06:39.289
Next time you should just ask.

684
01:06:48.898 --> 01:06:51.835
Now nothing happens
for 48 minutes.


685
01:06:53.136 --> 01:06:54.938
Which is a little
bit impressive,


686
01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:57.674
I didn't think he had it in him.

687
01:07:04.214 --> 01:07:07.917
See, the next thing you
know, Merle is dead.


688
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:16.360
- What else did you
find out about the cowboy?


689
01:07:16.393 --> 01:07:20.597
- Bob McIntyre either had
scruples, or he was just dumb.


690
01:07:22.432 --> 01:07:24.033
Other ranchers had been
bribed into allowing


691
01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:26.803
Futron Energy to
frack on their land.


692
01:07:26.836 --> 01:07:30.574
The cowboy was under
considerable pressure.


693
01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:32.809
Tom and Merle had
convinced him it was wrong.


694
01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:35.412
Then Starling threw in
Hazel to sweeten the deal,


695
01:07:35.445 --> 01:07:39.649
and she turned out to be
an even bigger influence.


696
01:07:39.683 --> 01:07:42.986
Oh, and I found out that
fracking causes earthquakes.


697
01:08:01.838 --> 01:08:02.806
Geez, what do you get out

698
01:08:02.839 --> 01:08:05.809
of such a ideological
rigid agenda?


699
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:09.879
Have you ever heard
of ethical oil?


700
01:08:09.913 --> 01:08:12.682
People need oil,
they demand oil.


701
01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:14.851
I tell you, I hate
to see my daughters


702
01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:18.688
living under some repressive
regime in the Middle East.


703
01:08:18.722 --> 01:08:22.826
No, I can't quite
picture you in burkas.


704
01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.128
- What
was Mr. James like?


705
01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:27.263
- He was a captain
of industry type.


706
01:08:27.297 --> 01:08:29.165
- You're destroying
everything I care about.


707
01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:32.168
- Inscrutable,
Machiavellian, philanthropist.


708
01:08:32.201 --> 01:08:33.937
Merle, come on, let's go.

709
01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:34.938
Merle please.

710
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:37.407
- It was obvious that he
and Merle had had some


711
01:08:37.441 --> 01:08:40.009
professional disagreements,
but he seemed to adore her,


712
01:08:40.043 --> 01:08:40.910
and Hazel.

713
01:08:41.945 --> 01:08:45.649
- My dear, those who
provide are the anointed.


714
01:08:48.017 --> 01:08:52.221
And those who don't appreciate
it can go fuck themselves.


715
01:08:56.059 --> 01:08:58.828
- Sabotage is just
the beginning.


716
01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:04.468
- I think it's time
to do a little tally


717
01:09:04.501 --> 01:09:06.370
on the old mental
scorecard here.


718
01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:09.506
So, Tom's resume, his
biography if you will,


719
01:09:09.539 --> 01:09:11.508
he is an ornithologist
who works at


720
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:14.143
the natural history museum, who

721
01:09:15.512 --> 01:09:17.747
at the time of Merle's
death claims he was working


722
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:20.484
on his dino-bird exhibit, right?

723
01:09:23.787 --> 01:09:26.790
Did you ever see that
show, What's My Line?


724
01:09:26.823 --> 01:09:27.691
Kind of.

725
01:09:28.925 --> 01:09:32.596
- So, on your episode
here, let's call it that,


726
01:09:32.629 --> 01:09:36.232
you decide not to ask
any questions at all.


727
01:09:37.133 --> 01:09:38.768
Instead, detective,

728
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.872
you suspect your husband
of having an affair


729
01:09:42.906 --> 01:09:46.209
and you begin to
surveil your marriage.


730
01:09:47.477 --> 01:09:49.546
So Tom's mistress
Merle, she just,


731
01:09:49.579 --> 01:09:52.115
she falls from a bridge
and just gets hit


732
01:09:52.148 --> 01:09:55.018
by an oncoming train and
her body just magically


733
01:09:55.051 --> 01:09:59.122
ends up in Tom's possession
in a fridge at the museum.


734
01:09:59.155 --> 01:10:03.192
Not to mention Tom
also bashes in the head


735
01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:05.028
of Merle's boyfriend Starling,

736
01:10:05.061 --> 01:10:07.263
and this is my favorite part,

737
01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:11.501
Tom uses Hazel, Merle's sister,
for his blue kimono fetish.


738
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:17.140
- Did you come here
to see me, or Merle?


739
01:10:20.143 --> 01:10:22.111
- Tom's motivation
for murdering Starling


740
01:10:22.145 --> 01:10:23.847
was all spelled out.

741
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:26.550
Jealous rage, revenge.

742
01:10:28.151 --> 01:10:32.088
Not to mention his
connection to Merle's death.


743
01:10:34.624 --> 01:10:37.494
And what is your
part in all this?


744
01:10:38.595 --> 01:10:42.298
By the way, does Tom
own a gray sports coat?


745
01:12:16.225 --> 01:12:19.829
- Don't you just love
to fuck tragic women?


746
01:12:21.197 --> 01:12:25.001
Makes me kind of hard
just thinking about it.


747
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:28.572
So what do you
think makes people


748
01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:31.808
stick together in
marriage like swans?


749
01:12:32.676 --> 01:12:34.110
'Cause personally I
don't want people to read


750
01:12:34.143 --> 01:12:36.913
in my obituary that
I snapped my neck


751
01:12:36.946 --> 01:12:39.583
tripping on some
fucking baby toy.


752
01:13:00.069 --> 01:13:00.937
Go on.

753
01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:09.813
The boy's an old hand.

754
01:13:39.743 --> 01:13:41.344
Where's your Tom?

755
01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:04.267
- You have had
too much to drink.


756
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.503
Why don't you go
upstairs to my suite.


757
01:14:08.838 --> 01:14:11.941
Take her with you
and straighten out.


758
01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:47.143
I like you.

759
01:14:47.977 --> 01:14:48.845
You do?

760
01:14:50.513 --> 01:14:53.182
What do you like about me?

761
01:14:53.216 --> 01:14:55.251
You're smart.

762
01:14:55.284 --> 01:14:56.652
You're stunning.

763
01:14:57.821 --> 01:14:58.955
Just like me.

764
01:15:52.508 --> 01:15:54.277
Say goodbye to Merle.

765
01:16:12.061 --> 01:16:14.697
What about your husband?

766
01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:18.267
Tom, does he uh, like
to fuck other women?


767
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.641
Oh wait, this is
payback sex, isn't it?


768
01:16:25.674 --> 01:16:28.444
Sauce for the
goose and all that.


769
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.717
Fuck you and your
murdering husband.


770
01:16:35.551 --> 01:16:37.453
Where's Merle's ring,
you rotten cunt?


771
01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:48.397
Tom is a dead man.

772
01:17:03.279 --> 01:17:05.748
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

773
01:17:13.857 --> 01:17:17.827
- We finally tracked down
Starling's cameraman.


774
01:17:19.595 --> 01:17:20.964
No, no!

775
01:17:20.997 --> 01:17:23.566
Merle, wait, come here.

776
01:17:23.599 --> 01:17:24.467
Come here!

777
01:19:18.948 --> 01:19:21.917
- Do you have
something to tell me?


778
01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:33.162
- She came to the
museum a few months ago.


779
01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.701
How many months?

780
01:19:42.571 --> 01:19:44.373
How many months?

781
01:19:44.407 --> 01:19:46.409
I don't know.

782
01:19:46.442 --> 01:19:47.310
A while.

783
01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:54.783
She came to convince me to

784
01:19:57.553 --> 01:19:59.788
convince the museum

785
01:19:59.822 --> 01:20:03.993
to withdraw from her
father's sponsorship.


786
01:20:04.027 --> 01:20:06.062
And she had some coke.

787
01:20:25.548 --> 01:20:27.183
What happened next?

788
01:20:32.855 --> 01:20:34.890
You started fucking her.

789
01:20:37.326 --> 01:20:40.696
How awkward, I
can't even imagine


790
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:43.032
how your parts got
stuck together.


791
01:20:43.066 --> 01:20:44.233
Just stop it.

792
01:20:44.267 --> 01:20:45.134
Why?

793
01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:47.970
Tom, why

794
01:20:49.238 --> 01:20:50.106
did you?

795
01:20:53.842 --> 01:20:55.111
Sheila.

796
01:20:58.581 --> 01:20:59.682
I was stoned.

797
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:02.551
Why didn't you stop it?

798
01:21:02.585 --> 01:21:04.553
What did you do to stop it?

799
01:21:04.587 --> 01:21:05.888
I,

800
01:21:05.921 --> 01:21:06.855
I couldn't.

801
01:21:09.024 --> 01:21:09.825
I couldn't.

802
01:21:09.858 --> 01:21:11.127
You couldn't.

803
01:21:12.095 --> 01:21:14.363
You couldn't, you couldn't,

804
01:21:15.364 --> 01:21:16.899
you couldn't what?

805
01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:22.205
What, were you fucking
her to save the planet?


806
01:21:41.724 --> 01:21:45.294
When I first started
filming Tom I felt like,


807
01:21:45.328 --> 01:21:49.532
by filming my marriage, I
could somehow protect it.


808
01:21:52.435 --> 01:21:54.937
But the more I capture the
things that were going on,


809
01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:58.107
the more things
appeared that I feared,


810
01:21:58.141 --> 01:22:00.176
that I couldn't control.

811
01:22:42.285 --> 01:22:43.152
No!

812
01:23:48.984 --> 01:23:50.253
We're asleep
throughout our lives


813
01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:54.257
and it's only in
death that we wake up,


814
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:58.160
just like we wake up
from sleep every morning.


815
01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:04.300
This is a wake.

816
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.068
For Merle,

817
01:24:08.271 --> 01:24:09.137
Starling,

818
01:24:10.873 --> 01:24:15.077
and anyone and anything who
ever has died or ever will die.


819
01:24:23.085 --> 01:24:24.853
Death is not the end.

820
01:24:27.723 --> 01:24:30.326
Wakes are for the living.

821
01:25:26.315 --> 01:25:29.852
* You've loved me forever

822
01:25:30.886 --> 01:25:33.756
* Until I ran dry

823
01:25:36.892 --> 01:25:41.096
* Then you said
goodbye for another *


824
01:25:49.872 --> 01:25:53.308
* You held me so tightly

825
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:57.546
* Until I asked why

826
01:26:00.516 --> 01:26:04.720
* Then you said
goodbye for another *


827
01:26:08.524 --> 01:26:11.059
* And another

828
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:15.831
* Goodbye

829
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.536
* For another

830
01:26:22.838 --> 01:26:26.274
* When no other would do

831
01:26:32.247 --> 01:26:34.450
* Goodbye

832
01:26:36.919 --> 01:26:39.455
* For another

833
01:26:41.524 --> 01:26:44.126
* But no other

834
01:26:45.894 --> 01:26:48.531
* Came through

835
01:27:14.957 --> 01:27:17.159
* Goodbye

836
01:27:19.628 --> 01:27:22.164
* For another

837
01:27:23.799 --> 01:27:26.502
* When no other

838
01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:31.239
* Would do

839
01:27:34.076 --> 01:27:36.278
* Goodbye

840
01:27:38.514 --> 01:27:41.049
* For another

841
01:27:42.818 --> 01:27:45.454
* But no other

842
01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:50.092
* Came through

843
01:27:53.095 --> 01:27:56.632
* You've loved me forever

844
01:27:57.833 --> 01:28:00.703
* Until I ran dry

845
01:28:03.539 --> 01:28:07.743
* Then you said
goodbye for another *


846
01:28:11.747 --> 01:28:14.282
* And another

847
01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:19.955
* Before I ran dry
