1
00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.867
Hey.

2
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:47.835
Are you okay?

3
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:04.921
Are you okay?

4
00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:16.760
- What the fu--

5
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.122
â™ª Ha, ha, ha ha, haa

6
00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:39.022
- I know.

7
00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:39.954
I know.

8
00:06:39.954 --> 00:06:41.266
I start my new job in a week.

9
00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:45.028
You'll get your money back.

10
00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:47.445
Thanks.

11
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.348
Do you remember me?

12
00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:22.323
I've missed you so much.

13
00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:24.878
So much.

14
00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:34.543
Hey, slow down.

15
00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:35.992
I brought you a whole packet.

16
00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:52.871
It's okay.

17
00:09:58.601 --> 00:10:01.431
- Stay here, I'll be right back.

18
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.850
Richard.

19
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.678
- Paige.

20
00:10:06.678 --> 00:10:07.921
- Spit that out!

21
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:09.094
I'm not going to waste
my money on medicine


22
00:10:09.094 --> 00:10:11.096
if you get a stomach ache.

23
00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:12.926
- You make me sick.

24
00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:16.481
Eight years, eight years ago
you took her away from me


25
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:17.827
and for what?

26
00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:19.864
So she can live in this dump?

27
00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:22.660
And if that wasn't enough,
she still doesn't say a word.


28
00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:26.318
Now that's all going to change.

29
00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:29.736
- What's this?

30
00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:32.877
- It explains just how bad
a mother you actually are.


31
00:10:32.877 --> 00:10:35.120
You do realize they're
coming to pick her up.


32
00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:39.400
- I've never seen a
social worker around here.


33
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.094
- I will not allow my daughter
to be taken into care.


34
00:10:43.094 --> 00:10:44.302
Come on, Mindy.

35
00:10:44.302 --> 00:10:45.130
- What do you
think you're doing?


36
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.097
- She's coming with me!

37
00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:47.961
- She's not going anywhere!

38
00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:02.907
- Why the fuck are you
pissing off my woman?


39
00:11:02.907 --> 00:11:05.150
- I just want my daughter back.

40
00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:08.015
I can give her a future.

41
00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:12.882
Next week I'm starting
a new job, a good job.


42
00:11:12.882 --> 00:11:14.194
- Just leave.

43
00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:16.230
- Paige, just listen to me.

44
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:21.719
- Are you deaf?

45
00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:23.341
Get the fuck out of here.

46
00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:27.448
- You've tattooed her name.

47
00:11:27.448 --> 00:11:29.450
Well I hope for you,
it's not permanent.


48
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:36.216
- You talk too much.

49
00:11:37.355 --> 00:11:38.805
I am going to count to three.

50
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.774
One,

51
00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:44.983
two,

52
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:47.779
three!

53
00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:48.608
- Okay.

54
00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:51.749
Okay, I'm leaving.

55
00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:00.274
I'll be back, sweetheart.

56
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.728
I promise.

57
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.375
Another one.

58
00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:36.138
- Make it a double
and I'll have a beer.


59
00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:36.966
Bad day?

60
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.107
It's on me.

61
00:12:46.873 --> 00:12:47.701
- I'm Richard.

62
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.911
- To Richard and
Sasha, the strangers.


63
00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:53.500
- Is it that obvious?

64
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.571
- Nobody here goes around
on a rented bicycle.


65
00:12:57.297 --> 00:12:59.886
So, what brings you here?

66
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.680
- Family matters.

67
00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:04.407
Unpleasant family matters.

68
00:13:04.407 --> 00:13:05.823
- Well, if it's any consolation,

69
00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:06.755
who doesn't have them?

70
00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:08.929
- Yeah, life shits on everybody,

71
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:10.448
but with me, it had diarrhea.

72
00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:13.831
I've made so many
mistakes in my life,


73
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:15.211
now I want to put things right.

74
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.075
I don't know where to begin.

75
00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:19.595
- Are we talking
about a broken heart?


76
00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:21.908
- No, the end of
my relationship was


77
00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:24.462
one of the few good things
that happened to me.


78
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.951
Today my heart beats
for just one person.


79
00:13:32.988 --> 00:13:35.438
And I'm happy to say, she
feels the same way too.


80
00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:38.959
- Oh, she's beautiful.

81
00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.134
Is this your daughter?

82
00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:42.204
- Her name is Mindy.

83
00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:46.311
And I need to get her
back at all costs.


84
00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.108
- Do you want to talk about it?

85
00:13:50.108 --> 00:13:51.523
Come on, I can help
you take your mind


86
00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:52.524
off things for a while.

87
00:13:52.524 --> 00:13:53.767
- You're not one of those--

88
00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.769
- No, of course I'm not.

89
00:13:58.668 --> 00:13:59.462
- Okay.

90
00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:03.604
- To Mindy.

91
00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:04.433
- To Mindy.

92
00:15:42.703 --> 00:15:44.844
I haven't enjoyed
myself this much since,


93
00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:48.123
I can't even remember
the last time.


94
00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:53.059
Perhaps this is
what we really need,


95
00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:55.130
the simple things in life,

96
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.546
without ulterior motives.

97
00:15:59.134 --> 00:16:00.100
Like tonight.

98
00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:04.001
Thank you.

99
00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:08.695
- Why don't you hire a lawyer?

100
00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:11.180
A good one.

101
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.388
You are her father.

102
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.632
A lawyer could help
to get her back.


103
00:16:14.632 --> 00:16:18.705
- Sasha, I'm still paying back
the debts my ex-wife ran up.


104
00:16:18.705 --> 00:16:21.190
I don't know when I'll be
able to afford a lawyer.


105
00:16:25.056 --> 00:16:26.299
What an idiot.

106
00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:28.266
- I can help.

107
00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:32.374
I can help to get
the money you need.


108
00:16:32.374 --> 00:16:34.065
- Yeah, right.

109
00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:36.723
- 25,000.

110
00:16:36.723 --> 00:16:37.551
- What?

111
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:39.070
- 25,000 euro.

112
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.658
Is that enough?

113
00:16:40.658 --> 00:16:42.108
- What are you talking about?

114
00:16:43.592 --> 00:16:45.352
- Tomorrow there is a new
theatrical format nearby,


115
00:16:45.352 --> 00:16:47.009
where a group of
aspiring actors will be


116
00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:49.943
closed inside a
theater for 24 hours,


117
00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:52.773
a whole day of pure
improvisation with no script.


118
00:16:52.773 --> 00:16:55.293
It's incredible and
the best part is,


119
00:16:55.293 --> 00:16:57.019
the actor who gives
the best performance


120
00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:58.710
wins the cash prize.

121
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.057
- That sounds too
good to be true.


122
00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:01.127
- But it is.

123
00:17:01.127 --> 00:17:02.852
I've been chosen
to take part and


124
00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:04.406
you could come with
me tomorrow morning.


125
00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:05.925
- Why would they
let me take part?


126
00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.375
I mean, I don't even
know how to act.


127
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:11.344
- Come on, I'm sure they'll
give you a chance because


128
00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:13.277
well, I don't think
it's actually legal


129
00:17:13.277 --> 00:17:16.590
seeing as I found it looking
for easy money in the deep web.


130
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.799
- If it's illegal, how do
you know they'll pay you?


131
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:21.216
- I think there must be
some clandestine gambling.


132
00:17:21.216 --> 00:17:23.080
I'd have more doubts
if it was legal.


133
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.772
Just give it a try.

134
00:17:25.772 --> 00:17:27.670
When will you get another
occasion like this?


135
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.913
What do you have to lose?

136
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:05.044
- Morning.

137
00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:07.322
- Good morning.

138
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:11.878
- Well, are you coming with me?

139
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.685
This should be the place.

140
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.960
Sorry, it's my fault, but
he's perfect for the show.


141
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.479
He's an outsider too, he's--

142
00:20:02.308 --> 00:20:03.826
What?

143
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.631
- I can see him.

144
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.943
We need to make a change.

145
00:20:19.187 --> 00:20:20.464
- Listen, are you
sure about this?


146
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.708
And I didn't like
the look of that guy.


147
00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:25.124
- Be a little more
optimistic and


148
00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:26.366
everything will work out fine.

149
00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:27.712
It's called the
law of attraction.


150
00:20:27.712 --> 00:20:29.680
- Yeah, if you say so.

151
00:21:31.638 --> 00:21:32.467
- I told you that--

152
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.442
Ah right, the rules.

153
00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:26.003
See? Not that bad.

154
00:22:26.003 --> 00:22:28.695
- Well, certainly
better than the outside.


155
00:22:44.918 --> 00:22:47.473
- Hey guys, come over here.

156
00:23:00.969 --> 00:23:01.797
I'm Debbie.

157
00:23:03.005 --> 00:23:04.800
- I'm Richard.

158
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.182
- Sasha, pleased to meet you.

159
00:23:07.182 --> 00:23:08.563
And you?

160
00:23:08.563 --> 00:23:09.391
- Kurt.

161
00:23:12.463 --> 00:23:15.397
- Uh, where are you from?

162
00:23:15.397 --> 00:23:17.468
- It's not important
where I'm from,


163
00:23:17.468 --> 00:23:18.607
but where I'm headed.

164
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:20.678
And you?

165
00:23:20.678 --> 00:23:21.921
Where are you from?

166
00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:22.784
- I'm English.

167
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.959
- And you?

168
00:23:25.959 --> 00:23:26.788
- Ukraine.

169
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.725
- That's not a joint, is it?

170
00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:35.797
- It's not important what
it is, but how it smokes.


171
00:23:35.797 --> 00:23:37.039
Why don't you get a life.

172
00:23:38.006 --> 00:23:38.972
- Uh, calm down.

173
00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:41.837
Move, get down!

174
00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:43.425
Everybody goes to the
center of the stage.


175
00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:49.673
You, on your knees.

176
00:23:49.673 --> 00:23:51.778
I said on your knees!

177
00:23:51.778 --> 00:23:52.848
- What's going on?

178
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:53.849
- Shut the fuck up!

179
00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:05.447
Look at me.

180
00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:07.553
Look at me!

181
00:24:10.763 --> 00:24:12.178
- No, no, please.

182
00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:38.204
- This is a fucking farce.

183
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.623
- Well done.

184
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.868
A wonderful performance,

185
00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:49.284
but let me introduce myself.

186
00:24:49.284 --> 00:24:52.460
I'm the director and my
audience greatly appreciated


187
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.256
this little introduction
and they want to see more,


188
00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:58.638
so please, continue.

189
00:25:01.192 --> 00:25:03.125
- Did you hear that?

190
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.300
They're giving me compliments.

191
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.612
Did you see my performance?

192
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.304
- Performance?

193
00:25:09.304 --> 00:25:10.719
You nearly shit yourself.

194
00:25:16.173 --> 00:25:18.451
Oh no, please.

195
00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:20.798
Eh, fuck this bullshit.

196
00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:22.144
I'm leaving.

197
00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:36.883
- Come on, let's go.

198
00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:39.127
- You have
just met mask number one


199
00:25:39.127 --> 00:25:43.062
and mask number two, who
together with three other masks


200
00:25:43.062 --> 00:25:45.236
will form the team of hunters.

201
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.453
So please, accept my
apologies for not having been


202
00:25:54.453 --> 00:25:56.731
completely sincere with you.

203
00:25:56.731 --> 00:26:00.044
But then again, without
a little deception,


204
00:26:00.044 --> 00:26:03.220
there would have been
no fun for our audience.


205
00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:16.751
- What the fuck's going on?

206
00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:17.579
- I don't know.

207
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:23.205
- Ladies
and gentlemen,


208
00:26:23.205 --> 00:26:24.690
you are the actors of future.

209
00:26:28.659 --> 00:26:30.419
I am pleased to inform you,

210
00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:32.663
that thanks to this
opening performance,


211
00:26:32.663 --> 00:26:37.426
the winner's prize has
increased to 100,000 euros,


212
00:26:37.426 --> 00:26:39.290
which will be divided
by those who manage


213
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.707
to stay alive until
tomorrow morning.


214
00:26:43.156 --> 00:26:47.126
However, in order to win
the money, you, the prey,


215
00:26:47.126 --> 00:26:49.128
have to eliminate
the team of hunters.


216
00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:52.131
But the hunters
will share the money


217
00:26:52.131 --> 00:26:54.616
if they manage to
eliminate all of you.


218
00:26:54.616 --> 00:26:57.999
On one condition, they
have to take their time


219
00:26:57.999 --> 00:27:02.831
and be creative in order to
make the show more entertaining.


220
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.214
And you as their prey,

221
00:27:06.214 --> 00:27:08.147
should know that we
have cameras everywhere.


222
00:27:08.147 --> 00:27:09.631
- We're not safe here.

223
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:13.532
- So searching for
a hiding place is pointless.


224
00:27:14.947 --> 00:27:15.982
- We need to get out.

225
00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:18.537
- Wait.

226
00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:20.124
Wait.

227
00:27:20.124 --> 00:27:25.129
Didn't you hear him?

228
00:27:28.512 --> 00:27:31.550
- Welcome to the one, the only,

229
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.137
theatrical team death match.

230
00:27:34.104 --> 00:27:36.209
Die in one day.

231
00:27:36.209 --> 00:27:37.521
Let the massacre begin.

232
00:29:08.577 --> 00:29:10.890
- Jesus, you're frightening.

233
00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:04.970
- If you think about
it, we have an advantage.


234
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.488
- Which is?

235
00:31:06.488 --> 00:31:08.767
- Like he said, they
can't kill us right away.


236
00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:11.700
- Your definition of advantage
leaves a lot to be desired.


237
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.012
- I know
it's brutal, but--


238
00:31:13.012 --> 00:31:14.496
- Listen.

239
00:31:14.496 --> 00:31:17.741
I have no intention of getting
killed, not now nor later.


240
00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:23.160
Fuck, fuck.
- Hey.


241
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.817
- Hey, over there.

242
00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:56.090
What I was trying to tell you is

243
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.401
we have a chance
to win the money.


244
00:31:57.401 --> 00:31:58.230
- Shit.

245
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.127
Fuck.

246
00:31:59.127 --> 00:32:00.094
Fuck.

247
00:32:00.094 --> 00:32:01.302
- Richard, I'm being serious.

248
00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:02.682
- So am I.

249
00:32:02.682 --> 00:32:04.857
I was always told to
keep out of trouble.


250
00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:05.720
- It's a lot of money.

251
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.101
Think about Mindy.

252
00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:11.933
- What's happening?

253
00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:15.040
Come on.

254
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.008
Debbie?

255
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:19.380
- Do you think we
should help her?


256
00:33:27.733 --> 00:33:28.561
- Look.

257
00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:24.884
Debbie!

258
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:54.466
- Run, Sasha, run!

259
00:38:50.918 --> 00:38:51.746
- Fuck.

260
00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:22.725
- Communication
to the hunters,


261
00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:24.347
a bonus will be awarded
if you manage to


262
00:41:24.347 --> 00:41:28.109
eliminate one of the two
remaining contestants


263
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:30.146
in the next few minutes.

264
00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:34.633
But remember, it has
to be done with style.


265
00:42:05.353 --> 00:42:06.700
- You've tattooed her name.

266
00:44:10.755 --> 00:44:11.583
Why him?

267
00:44:13.378 --> 00:44:14.931
Tell me.

268
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:15.760
Why him?

269
00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:21.351
What the fuck does
all this mean?


270
00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:26.391
Fuck.

271
00:44:28.151 --> 00:44:28.980
Fuck!

272
00:45:13.024 --> 00:45:13.852
- Fuck.

273
00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:50.820
- Come on you fucking freak.

274
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.821
Bring it on!

275
00:56:59.074 --> 00:56:59.902
- Richard?

276
00:57:02.077 --> 00:57:03.216
- Don't touch me.

277
00:57:03.216 --> 00:57:04.528
Stay away from me.

278
00:57:06.288 --> 00:57:08.290
This, what does it mean?

279
00:57:09.222 --> 00:57:10.706
- It's--

280
00:57:10.706 --> 00:57:12.674
- You knew about this from
the start and you set me up.


281
00:57:12.674 --> 00:57:13.640
- I can explain.

282
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.469
- What?

283
00:57:14.469 --> 00:57:15.401
What can you explain?

284
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:16.919
- It's not what you think.

285
00:57:16.919 --> 00:57:20.129
I mean, yes, I
knew who you were,


286
00:57:20.129 --> 00:57:21.924
and I did everything to
get you to take part,


287
00:57:21.924 --> 00:57:25.307
but I swear, I didn't know
that this would happen.


288
00:57:27.205 --> 00:57:28.621
I thought it was just a game.

289
00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:35.248
I know, I made a mistake.

290
00:57:37.388 --> 00:57:38.596
With the letter too.

291
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:43.049
I did it for Mindy.

292
00:57:43.049 --> 00:57:45.085
- Leave my daughter out of this!

293
00:57:45.085 --> 00:57:48.019
- She may be your daughter,
but she's also my sister.


294
00:57:48.019 --> 00:57:50.436
My name is Sasha,
short for Alexandra.


295
00:57:50.436 --> 00:57:51.471
Paige is my mother.

296
00:57:51.471 --> 00:57:52.714
I'm her first child.

297
00:57:59.065 --> 00:58:01.550
- I knew she'd been
married before in Russia--


298
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:02.379
- Ukraine.

299
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:06.003
- I didn't know
she had a daughter.


300
00:58:06.003 --> 00:58:07.901
- Of course you didn't.

301
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.421
When I was 13, she sold
me to start a new life.


302
00:58:11.629 --> 00:58:13.804
When I finally found
her six months ago,


303
00:58:13.804 --> 00:58:15.668
I discovered that
I had a sister.


304
00:58:16.945 --> 00:58:18.981
We immediately became close.

305
00:58:18.981 --> 00:58:21.984
I go to visit her
every time she's alone.


306
00:58:21.984 --> 00:58:25.263
And she is also so
sweet, so innocent.


307
00:58:25.263 --> 00:58:28.025
I swore to myself that
what happened to me


308
00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:29.509
would never happen to her.

309
00:58:30.959 --> 00:58:32.547
And I tried everything to
get her away from Paige,


310
00:58:32.547 --> 00:58:34.549
but it was useless.

311
00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:42.384
Please,

312
00:58:43.523 --> 00:58:44.421
forgive me.

313
00:58:45.905 --> 00:58:50.323
I just wanted to improve
our chances of winning.


314
00:58:50.323 --> 00:58:51.324
- Sasha--

315
00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:03.267
- Richard!

316
00:59:18.351 --> 00:59:19.179
You.

317
00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.009
- Me.

318
00:59:23.218 --> 00:59:25.565
We are not that different.

319
00:59:25.565 --> 00:59:28.154
I do it for the money too.

320
00:59:28.154 --> 00:59:29.949
- You're nothing
but a sick bastard.


321
01:00:13.613 --> 01:00:15.615
- Yeah, I'm a sick fuck.

322
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.725
And you know what I'm
going to do when I win?


323
01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:26.730
I will sell that little bitch
to the first pedo I can find.


324
01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:30.906
But, your mother was
wrong about one thing.


325
01:00:32.805 --> 01:00:35.808
She said you weren't a worth
shit compared to your sister,


326
01:00:35.808 --> 01:00:38.604
but today, you are
worth a fortune.


327
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:43.470
- For you two, money
is never enough.


328
01:00:50.685 --> 01:00:51.548
- Shh,

329
01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:52.376
shh,

330
01:00:52.376 --> 01:00:53.170
shhh.

331
01:00:58.762 --> 01:00:59.935
Now it's your turn.

332
01:01:00.936 --> 01:01:02.559
- Stop.

333
01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:05.941
If there is one thing
I can not stand,


334
01:01:07.115 --> 01:01:10.394
it is seeing my simple
rules being broken.


335
01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:14.985
You can not eliminate
one of your teammates.


336
01:01:14.985 --> 01:01:17.850
My audience isn't
paying for this.


337
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.922
They are paying
to enjoy the show.


338
01:01:20.922 --> 01:01:23.234
- Fuck you and fuck your rules!

339
01:01:23.234 --> 01:01:24.132
I want my--

340
01:01:28.515 --> 01:01:29.862
- Run.

341
01:01:29.862 --> 01:01:30.690
Run.

342
01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:53.299
- I bet you are thinking
about Mindy right now.


343
01:01:55.094 --> 01:01:55.888
So am I.

344
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:05.242
- Go to fucking hell.

345
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:34.892
- Sasha.

346
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.378
- I don't want to die.

347
01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:39.828
I don't want to die.

348
01:04:12.334 --> 01:04:13.991
- Finally alone, eh?

349
01:04:15.406 --> 01:04:16.407
Eh bitch?!

350
01:04:45.712 --> 01:04:46.541
- Debbie!

351
01:04:49.406 --> 01:04:50.234
Richard!

352
01:05:48.016 --> 01:05:50.156
Did you like the
show, mother fuckers?


353
01:10:54.288 --> 01:10:56.497
The day we give them
back to each other again


354
01:10:57.705 --> 01:10:59.845
will be the day I take
you away from here.


355
01:11:23.144 --> 01:11:24.939
I'm here to report
a missing person.


356
01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:26.768
- When?

357
01:11:27.735 --> 01:11:28.839
- When?

358
01:11:28.839 --> 01:11:30.600
When she went missing?

359
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.327
Uh, this morning or
perhaps yesterday.


360
01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.190
I'm not sure.

361
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:39.333
- Fill this in.

362
01:11:46.132 --> 01:11:47.996
- You should be
ashamed of yourselves.


363
01:11:48.894 --> 01:11:49.860
Forget it.

364
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.448
I'll go elsewhere, assholes.

365
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:14.747
- Hello?

366
01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.197
- I served her up
to you on a plate


367
01:12:16.197 --> 01:12:18.441
and you didn't
manage to kill her.


368
01:12:18.441 --> 01:12:19.269
I also lost Vinnie.

369
01:12:19.269 --> 01:12:20.891
I want compensation now.

370
01:12:20.891 --> 01:12:23.963
- You will receive much more
than you can possibly imagine.


371
01:12:23.963 --> 01:12:26.759
We are taking the show
to the next level.


372
01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.520
- And what makes you
think she'll come back?


373
01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.384
- Oh, she'll come back.

374
01:12:32.006 --> 01:12:34.146
Because she is the best
player we ever met.


375
01:12:35.561 --> 01:12:39.841
And you, you are going to sell
me what she is looking for.
