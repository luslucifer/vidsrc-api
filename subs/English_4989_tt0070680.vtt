1
00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:55.673
The only two fighters to win
three different titles were...


2
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.005
...Ruby Bob Fitzsimmons and Henry Armstrong.

3
00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:04.806
ln baseball, who holds the record
for the most stolen bases?


4
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.852
Maury Wills holds the modern record,
but the overall record...


5
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:12.253
...is held by Harry Stovey of Philadelphia.
ln 1888 the man stole 156 bases.


6
00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:13.814
All right, in football...

7
00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.952
...what were the names
of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame?


8
00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:22.125
Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller,
Elmer Layden and Sleepy Jim Crowley.


9
00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:23.595
The only two fighters....

10
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.772
Heavy's Pool Hall, 
Heavy speaking.

11
00:01:31.643 --> 00:01:33.042
-Springy?
-Yeah?


12
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.978
-You seen McCoy today?
-No, he ain't been in yet, Heav.


13
00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:39.244
Robert Mitera holds the record
for the longest hole in one.


14
00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.217
Try the shamus at home.

15
00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:45.518
535-0184.

16
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.172
Yeah?

17
00:02:07.312 --> 00:02:09.212
6:30.

18
00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.478
What is your address?

19
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.785
Where the hell is that?

20
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.589
Westchester?

21
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.255
Are you sure you got the right McCoy?

22
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.391
All right, you pay
for the car rental, right?

23
00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.370
All right, 6:30.

24
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:50.393
Oh, 'morning.

25
00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:54.322
Hi.

26
00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.093
You want some coffee with cream and sugar?

27
00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.495
Do you have any saccharine?

28
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.271
l don't have any cream and sugar.

29
00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:12.439
-You know what?
-What?


30
00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:17.113
Well, l never slept
on a pool table before.

31
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.586
l told you to put your feet in the side pockets.
lt keeps them warm, you know.


32
00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:28.097
ls that what you meant?

33
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:34.035
You know, and l kept on thinking
you were some kind of foot freak....


34
00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:38.639
Listen....

35
00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:41.108
-Alice.
-Alice, yeah.


36
00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:44.307
lf a cat comes around here, you let him in.
All right, honey?


37
00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:46.009
What kind of cat?

38
00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:49.485
Just a cat, you know. 
Like a little cat.

39
00:07:49.554 --> 00:07:50.953
l hate cats.

40
00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:55.021
Well, how could you stand them?

41
00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:59.492
He just stands me. You understand?
l don't stand him, he stands me.


42
00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:02.556
Give him something to eat, all right?

43
00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:04.635
All right, yeah. l will.

44
00:08:08.072 --> 00:08:11.166
Where is the fire?

45
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.278
-You know what? You're terrific.
-What?


46
00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:18.878
Yeah. Well, you're not so bad yourself.

47
00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:21.781
You be out of here by 12:00.

48
00:08:21.853 --> 00:08:24.686
-All right.
-See ya.


49
00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:21.740
Get down!

50
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.915
Stay, Lancer!

51
00:09:26.984 --> 00:09:30.112
lt's okay now. 
You can come out, Mr. McCoy.

52
00:09:32.023 --> 00:09:35.322
-l'll just stay in the car.
-But Mr. Hume is expecting you inside.


53
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.120
As long as Rin Tin Tin's around,
l'll stay in the car.


54
00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:41.131
Suppose l take him down to the kennel?

55
00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.457
Good thinking.

56
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.792
Heel.

57
00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:53.269
-Mr. McCoy?
-Yeah.


58
00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:56.836
Please come in. Mr. 
Hume is expecting you.

59
00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:26.936
This way, please.

60
00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:33.745
Come in.

61
00:10:37.622 --> 00:10:40.056
Thank you for coming, Mr. McCoy.

62
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.054
Are you a dog lover, Mr. McCoy?

63
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.396
When l see dogs like
that, l get very emotional.

64
00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:50.624
-Emotional?
-Yeah.


65
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.965
They scare the shit out of me.

66
00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:56.465
Marvelous.

67
00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:59.169
Tait, take Samson back to the kennels.

68
00:10:59.544 --> 00:11:01.011
Come, Samson.

69
00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:06.615
Come, Samson.

70
00:11:12.757 --> 00:11:15.851
Come in, Mr. McCoy. Have a seat.

71
00:11:17.195 --> 00:11:20.961
Can l offer you something?
A cold drink? lced tea?


72
00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:23.222
No, thank you.

73
00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:26.198
Very well. To business then.

74
00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:31.605
Mr. McCoy, what do you know about me?

75
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.173
You know, l was thinking about that
on the way out here.


76
00:11:36.547 --> 00:11:40.108
''E.J. Hume, now what the hell
could he want with me?''


77
00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:44.477
Maybe advice on his diamond mines
or his oil wells.


78
00:11:46.424 --> 00:11:48.858
You have a delicious sense of humor.

79
00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:52.462
What can l do to help you?

80
00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:56.463
Very good.

81
00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:58.634
l like that.

82
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:06.640
Last Sunday, burglars broke into
the Lanvan Jewelry Company.


83
00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:12.515
Took millions in cut and uncut diamonds
from a supposedly impregnable safe.


84
00:12:13.684 --> 00:12:15.549
Very professional job.

85
00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:19.689
The police had just about established
that Victor Pappas...


86
00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:23.716
...a well-known man in his field,
was the key man in the burglary...


87
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.686
...when he turned up dead.

88
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:29.094
Heard of him?

89
00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:32.498
-Yeah, the guy was burned, right?
-Right.


90
00:12:32.803 --> 00:12:35.795
Now, l want to find
out who killed him and why.

91
00:12:36.607 --> 00:12:38.575
And l want to know fast.

92
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.368
Why?

93
00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:44.436
l'm the Lanvan Jewelry Company.
Those diamonds are mine.


94
00:12:45.082 --> 00:12:46.572
Tried the police?

95
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.087
My people are in touch with them.
l doubt if it'll do any good.


96
00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:52.178
They must have been insured.

97
00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:54.383
Those diamonds belong to me.

98
00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.386
l want them back.

99
00:12:57.261 --> 00:13:00.253
Find Pappas' killer and you'll find the diamonds.

100
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.392
Are you sure you
wouldn't like some iced tea?

101
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.670
No, thank you.

102
00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:35.655
Why me? There are a lot of other
very high-class detectives around.


103
00:13:35.733 --> 00:13:36.893
Why would you pick me?

104
00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:40.028
You were not the first
idea that came to mind.

105
00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:41.999
The second?

106
00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:43.665
The fifty-third.

107
00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:45.866
The next time, lie.

108
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:51.780
Two reasons:

109
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:57.214
One, Pappas was a Brooklyn boy,
and you're a Brooklyn detective.


110
00:13:58.122 --> 00:14:00.682
Two, the price is right.

111
00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:05.992
You can use the cash, and l like to work
with people who need my money.


112
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.421
lt gives me a trump card.

113
00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:17.563
You think you can buy me?

114
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:21.771
l'll give you $10,000 to come up with the killer
or the diamonds.


115
00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:24.178
$5,000 now, $5,000 more on delivery.

116
00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:26.144
You just bought me.

117
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:32.815
l want a report every day, understood?

118
00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:34.822
Understood.

119
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.020
Any questions?

120
00:14:37.828 --> 00:14:39.295
No questions.

121
00:14:39.764 --> 00:14:41.493
l'm relying on you, McCoy.

122
00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:44.596
You'll be seeing me.

123
00:14:49.607 --> 00:14:53.099
-Now l understand why you wear that jacket.
-ln winter we wear overcoats.


124
00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:55.668
You can hang beef up in that joint.

125
00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:28.168
-l've seen the horse run before.
-l don't need your suggestion.


126
00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:31.942
You've got a diseased mind.
You wouldn't know a winner if you fell over one.


127
00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:35.110
-You don't know a winner.
-Will you look at it. He's due to pop.


128
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:37.518
-Will you stop? Look.
-No. You are the worst.


129
00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:38.680
Don't do that.

130
00:15:38.756 --> 00:15:41.953
Split and take yesterday's suggestions
with you, you creep.


131
00:15:42.026 --> 00:15:44.256
l don't need a
partner in a pool hall.

132
00:15:44.328 --> 00:15:46.296
-Who is this from?
-Mama.


133
00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:49.226
She wants to know
what night you're coming to dinner.


134
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.064
-ls Vinnie here?
-Upstairs. Where else?


135
00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:54.534
Tell your mama l love her.

136
00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:01.741
-McCoy, what do you say?
-No, Sal. l got a hangover.


137
00:16:06.684 --> 00:16:11.178
ln 1952, ''English'' Sammy Marxon
scored 200 consecutive bull's eyes...


138
00:16:11.255 --> 00:16:15.055
...throwing a 10-inch butcher knife at 50 yards,
left-handed.


139
00:16:15.426 --> 00:16:17.087
The record stands.

140
00:16:22.032 --> 00:16:26.230
-Kid's got a nice stroke.
-Yeah. He could be a good one.


141
00:16:26.704 --> 00:16:31.732
ln 1924, ''Tight Pockets'' Maxie Braunschweiger
ran 124 straight in one pocket.


142
00:16:32.009 --> 00:16:34.000
Good old Max, the German.

143
00:16:39.683 --> 00:16:41.514
l'm glad you talked to him--

144
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:44.145
l want you to check up
on a man named Vic Pappas.


145
00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:46.246
Big Vic Pappas? 
Pappas worked on the docks.

146
00:16:46.323 --> 00:16:49.224
-No, l want to know who hit him.
-lf l knew who hit him--


147
00:16:49.293 --> 00:16:53.161
Also a man named E.J. Humes.
Did you ever hear of him?


148
00:16:54.298 --> 00:16:57.756
-E.J. Hume, credited to be one of--
-Not the usual crap.


149
00:16:58.102 --> 00:17:01.936
E.J. Hume, in 1942, made.... 
Not the usual crap.

150
00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:03.967
l can handle that.

151
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:05.702
l'll see you later.

152
00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:34.333
Come on with that damn
thing, it's not a church.

153
00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:36.066
-My mother's....
-Yeah, yeah.


154
00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:46.040
l have statistics that prove that 90 percent
of guinea cops are lousy crap shooters.


155
00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.084
Who the....

156
00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:52.412
Please, stop. l got the worst hangover.

157
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:56.425
-lf you were married--
-lf l was married, l'd be home with my wife in bed.


158
00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.222
Well, up yours.

159
00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:01.164
What's happening with the Pappas case?

160
00:18:01.232 --> 00:18:02.961
Who wants to know?

161
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.101
-l have a client.
-You got a client?


162
00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.534
l got a client, yes.

163
00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:08.128
-Who?
-Who what?


164
00:18:08.205 --> 00:18:09.729
Who what? Who's the client?

165
00:18:09.807 --> 00:18:14.540
-lt's none of your business who my client is.
-Well, then read about it in the papers.


166
00:18:15.112 --> 00:18:16.170
Vinnie...

167
00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:20.875
...come on, you help me, you help my client.
Give me some information.


168
00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:22.213
We don't know a damn thing.

169
00:18:22.286 --> 00:18:24.015
-Nothing?
-Honestly.


170
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:29.291
l can't get over you going legit.

171
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:34.188
l'd be better off shooting pool full time.
l'd make more money.


172
00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:38.326
l know a couple of hustlers down there
who wouldn't mind that either.


173
00:18:38.402 --> 00:18:39.926
Take care.

174
00:18:45.242 --> 00:18:47.210
The way you deal....

175
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.681
-Hi, Mac.
-Sit down, Mac. You got a buck?


176
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.250
-l got a buck.
-For a buck, l'll let you in.


177
00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:57.310
Cheapie game.

178
00:18:58.155 --> 00:19:00.817
That's only the beginning.
You didn't tell him the rest.


179
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.587
Some of the details,
we got some surprises for you.


180
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:05.891
-Do you feel lucky?
-l always feel lucky.


181
00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:07.959
The cards are hot.

182
00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:15.232
You guys hear anything on the Pappas burning?

183
00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:20.209
Make it $25.

184
00:19:20.277 --> 00:19:22.575
What is the proposition, McCoy?

185
00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:26.475
Big shot. l bet it all.

186
00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:38.323
Mac, how much money are we talking about?

187
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.598
-We're talking about $100.
-That's not enough. At least a deuce.


188
00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:48.037
All right, Rock, a deuce. 
Make it good, go.

189
00:19:49.073 --> 00:19:52.804
The broad with Pappas,
her old man's pushing for Big Macio.


190
00:19:53.644 --> 00:19:58.638
Shooting Galleries, 34 South Street,
apartment two, down by the docks.


191
00:19:59.516 --> 00:20:02.110
-Name is Johnnie Brosten.
-Johnnie Brosten.


192
00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:05.187
-Yep.
-Well, is that it?


193
00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.385
-That's it.
-What about Pappas?


194
00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:08.686
Nothing.

195
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:12.125
-ls that all l get for a deuce? Come on.
-Nothing. No talk.


196
00:20:12.196 --> 00:20:14.721
Somebody big has put the lid on tight.

197
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.225
All right, Rock.

198
00:20:19.203 --> 00:20:20.295
McCoy...

199
00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:25.266
...that Johnnie Brosten is a junkie.
Watch yourself.


200
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.609
Thanks, Rock.

201
00:21:03.113 --> 00:21:04.045
Yeah?

202
00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.505
Big M sent me.

203
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.080
He said l could feed my arm here.

204
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.911
Just a second.

205
00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:17.892
Don't move, you son of a bitch.
Don't move or l'll cut your head off.


206
00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:20.990
Open up, Johnnie.

207
00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:31.097
Get them out, Johnnie.

208
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.804
Everyone move.

209
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:22.582
-Tell me about Vic Pappas.
-l don't know.


210
00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:24.684
-Tell me.
-l don't know anything.


211
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.025
You don't know anything?

212
00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:31.823
Tell me!

213
00:22:32.302 --> 00:22:34.099
l never even knew him.

214
00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:36.634
No, wait, wait!

215
00:22:37.374 --> 00:22:40.036
lt's true. l never even saw him.

216
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.302
My wife worked at this...

217
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.242
...joint as a bookkeeper.

218
00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:48.113
What joint? What joint?

219
00:22:48.252 --> 00:22:51.983
Riveredge Export.
lt's on Front Street, down at the docks.


220
00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:54.551
That's all l know. Honest. Honest!

221
00:22:54.625 --> 00:22:57.560
That's all.... l didn't even know
that they were making it.


222
00:22:57.628 --> 00:23:00.358
l swear. That's all l know.

223
00:23:00.697 --> 00:23:03.325
Try Riveredge. Don't.

224
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.892
Or John Bolton. He'd know. 
He was Pappas' pal.

225
00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:09.499
Where do l find him? 
Where do l find him?

226
00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:12.133
He works at the Health Club...

227
00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:14.743
...in the Village East, Broadway.

228
00:23:16.346 --> 00:23:17.472
ls that it?

229
00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.907
On my dead mother, l swear.

230
00:24:03.927 --> 00:24:05.360
Take anything you like.

231
00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:09.456
-l bet you thought this was a sweat box.
-That's what l thought it was, a sweat box.


232
00:24:09.533 --> 00:24:11.296
Good food. lt'll make you healthy.

233
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:14.826
-You've been eating a lot of fat?
-Yeah. Enjoy yourself.


234
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.417
...lifetime batting average was 369.

235
00:24:29.486 --> 00:24:32.819
Stanley Ketchel, the ''Michigan Assassin,''
had 85 lifetime KOs...


236
00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:35.221
...and would not pass up a bribe
for the tank shot.


237
00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:37.886
McCoy, say hello to
my friend Marvin, the waiter.

238
00:24:37.961 --> 00:24:40.156
-Mr. Shicks.
-Hi, Marvin.


239
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:44.560
-Rare or medium?
-Marvin, rare, double vodka, no ice.


240
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:47.694
You got something for me, right?

241
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.867
l got good news,
and l got bad news.

242
00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:53.273
Give me the bad news.

243
00:24:53.343 --> 00:24:58.337
The bad news is the information faucet
is really turned off on the Pappas thing.


244
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.910
-Give me the good news.
-l got your message, and here l am.


245
00:25:02.986 --> 00:25:05.454
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you, Marvin.


246
00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:11.323
Heinie Manush and Goose Goslin
never played ball together, contrary to belief.


247
00:25:12.362 --> 00:25:13.454
Marvin.

248
00:25:16.566 --> 00:25:18.090
Where's Bolton?

249
00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:20.663
See those guys hand-wrestling at the bar?

250
00:25:20.737 --> 00:25:22.864
The guy in the T-shirt, that's Bolton.

251
00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:27.239
l predict he will be pinned in two minutes,
he's pitted against Big Felix Montaigne.


252
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.041
-Felix who?
-Felix Montaigne, football player, was tight end.


253
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:33.981
Ex-all-American, ex-all-pro,
till he busted his knee.


254
00:25:41.058 --> 00:25:43.959
-What did l tell you?
-You were right.


255
00:25:44.594 --> 00:25:46.824
-Thank you.
-Marvin.


256
00:25:47.064 --> 00:25:48.429
''Strangler'' Lewis...

257
00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:51.625
...had 125 consecutive pins in 1936.

258
00:25:54.671 --> 00:25:58.607
-What does Bolton do?
-Bolton's a bouncer, and he loves his work.


259
00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:02.333
All right, l'm going to
get a closer look at Bolton.

260
00:26:03.847 --> 00:26:06.543
You work on Victor Mature's leg.

261
00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:30.635
-You creep, l saw that.
-Who did that? Did you pinch me?


262
00:26:30.707 --> 00:26:33.608
-Pinch you?
-ls that the way you get your jollies?


263
00:26:33.677 --> 00:26:38.011
Me? l certainly did not. l got a drink in one hand
and a briefcase in the other.


264
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:41.016
How could he have pinched me?
He had something in both hands.


265
00:26:41.084 --> 00:26:43.279
He put it down, grabbed
you, picked it back up.

266
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:46.345
-ls that the way you get your jollies?
-lt certainly is not.


267
00:26:46.423 --> 00:26:48.721
l should have met my friend someplace else.

268
00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:51.989
-Didn't we meet in a massage parlor?
-You're a very disturbed man.


269
00:26:52.062 --> 00:26:55.156
l am. You disturb me a great deal.
l think l'm in love with you.


270
00:26:55.232 --> 00:26:58.201
-l don't want to be pushy, but l love you.
-This guy bothering you?


271
00:26:58.268 --> 00:26:59.292
Outrageous!

272
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:02.236
-Look, the Health Club is here.
-ls everything all right here?


273
00:27:02.305 --> 00:27:05.433
-Yes, everything is just fine, thank you.
-Sorry.


274
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:07.968
Do you mind holding this?

275
00:27:17.754 --> 00:27:20.018
-You like it?
-Marvin.


276
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:26.754
Onni Savi, the ''Finn Fantastic''
skied 190 miles without stopping in 1966.


277
00:27:30.867 --> 00:27:32.266
Keep the change, Marvin.

278
00:27:34.805 --> 00:27:37.239
Keep digging on Pappas.
l'm going to check on Bolton.


279
00:27:37.307 --> 00:27:39.867
McCoy, the guy likes to hurt people.

280
00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:46.579
Onni Savi?

281
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:49.678
Who the hell is Onni Savi?

282
00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:58.994
Thank you.
What time does this place close, honey?


283
00:27:59.062 --> 00:28:02.691
-2:00 a.m. What do you have in mind?
-Thought we'd do some skin diving.


284
00:28:02.766 --> 00:28:04.495
Bring your snorkel.

285
00:28:35.332 --> 00:28:37.197
You make me so sick.

286
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:46.030
Miss?

287
00:28:47.744 --> 00:28:50.474
Just a moment, please.
l'll be right with you.

288
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:54.111
-You got today's newspapers?
-Yeah.


289
00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:58.076
Anything else?

290
00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:01.824
-You don't carry <i>Ring Riders</i> in there?
-No, we don't.


291
00:29:05.795 --> 00:29:08.286
You're a healthy devil, aren't you?

292
00:29:09.733 --> 00:29:12.258
ls there anything else
l can help you with?

293
00:29:15.972 --> 00:29:18.702
Well, l was just looking for something
to read tonight.


294
00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.470
You got any suggestions?

295
00:29:26.383 --> 00:29:28.851
Well, how about the new Walter Hill novel?

296
00:29:29.753 --> 00:29:33.553
No, l don't think so. 
What are you reading now?

297
00:29:35.392 --> 00:29:39.419
Well, currently,
l'm just finishing <i>Hoffnung und Sorge</i>.


298
00:29:39.496 --> 00:29:40.929
By Karl Jaspers.

299
00:29:42.132 --> 00:29:43.861
-You know that?
-l read it.


300
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:48.163
Do you know <i>Die Unauffindbaren</i>
by Ernst Kreuder?


301
00:29:48.338 --> 00:29:51.136
-l know it very well.
-l can't wait to get into that.


302
00:29:51.207 --> 00:29:52.640
Do you fool around?

303
00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:01.751
l've heard a lot of approaches.

304
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.782
You certainly don't have a problem being direct,
do you?


305
00:30:08.391 --> 00:30:11.588
Well, l'll tell you, somebody
as pretty as you are...

306
00:30:13.997 --> 00:30:16.625
...they've heard every line there is, you know.

307
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.498
Well, you didn't get
a body like that overnight.

308
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.501
Did you?

309
00:30:23.273 --> 00:30:24.501
No.

310
00:30:26.643 --> 00:30:28.076
Thank God.

311
00:30:58.008 --> 00:31:01.876
lf you ever want the <i>Melbourne Gazette</i>
or the latest...


312
00:31:06.249 --> 00:31:10.049
...<i>Kennels and Paddocks</i>,
you know where to find them.


313
00:31:11.454 --> 00:31:13.149
l'll make a point of it.

314
00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:26.265
Move it.

315
00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:30.837
Come on, move it.

316
00:32:07.077 --> 00:32:08.635
Who killed Pappas?

317
00:32:10.513 --> 00:32:11.810
Are you a cop?

318
00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:13.712
Who killed Pappas?

319
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:16.944
l don't know. l swear to God.

320
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.415
Are you and him partners?

321
00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:20.714
No.

322
00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:23.585
No bullshit. Come on!

323
00:32:24.994 --> 00:32:27.121
Look, l don't know who killed him.

324
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.290
l just introduced him
to some people is all.

325
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.960
What people?

326
00:32:33.636 --> 00:32:36.400
-They'll burn me.
-What people?


327
00:32:38.007 --> 00:32:39.304
Montaigne.

328
00:32:40.977 --> 00:32:42.842
-Felix Montaigne?
-Yeah.


329
00:32:51.287 --> 00:32:52.686
Hey, you!

330
00:32:53.957 --> 00:32:56.221
Your life ain't worth spit.

331
00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:17.073
-Heavy, is Springy around?
-No. No calls.


332
00:33:17.514 --> 00:33:19.675
-You want some coffee?
-No.


333
00:33:19.949 --> 00:33:21.280
What the hell is that?

334
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:24.286
l lent a guy a fin
and he gave these as collateral.

335
00:33:24.354 --> 00:33:26.413
What do you think? 
Do they do anything for me?

336
00:33:26.489 --> 00:33:29.515
Yeah. You look like a faggot movie star.

337
00:33:29.592 --> 00:33:30.718
Thanks.

338
00:33:31.528 --> 00:33:34.497
-Tell him l want to check up on that guy.
-Felix Montaigne?


339
00:33:34.564 --> 00:33:37.032
Yeah. Have him call me first thing
in the morning.


340
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.124
Sure.

341
00:33:39.135 --> 00:33:41.933
Hey, feet off the table.

342
00:34:27.517 --> 00:34:29.917
You're going to beat the
shit out of me, right?

343
00:34:29.986 --> 00:34:31.180
That's right.

344
00:34:31.854 --> 00:34:34.789
-Can't we talk this over?
-You talk too much, McCoy.


345
00:34:42.599 --> 00:34:46.035
-Get him up, get him up.
-Hold him up.


346
00:34:56.012 --> 00:34:57.445
Forget Pappas.

347
00:34:59.582 --> 00:35:02.278
You understand? 
Forget Pappas.

348
00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:28.342
Hey, McCoy, it's me, Springy.

349
00:35:28.978 --> 00:35:30.240
lt's unlocked.

350
00:35:32.915 --> 00:35:36.214
Hey, where you been?
l've been calling you for an hour.


351
00:35:36.286 --> 00:35:37.310
l've been out.

352
00:35:37.387 --> 00:35:39.753
You could give a guy
a call, tell him where....

353
00:35:39.822 --> 00:35:41.756
What are you doing in the tub?

354
00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:44.958
l'm taking a bath.

355
00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:47.556
Taking a bath with your clothes on?

356
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.325
Saves on a laundry bill.

357
00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:52.460
Give me a towel.

358
00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:56.997
And a shirt.

359
00:35:57.073 --> 00:35:59.268
-Where?
-Over there.


360
00:36:05.381 --> 00:36:07.076
ls this one all right?

361
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.380
Yeah. What about Pappas?

362
00:36:09.452 --> 00:36:12.080
-Hey, you're walking funny.
-Yeah.


363
00:36:12.188 --> 00:36:13.849
So why are you walking funny?

364
00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:17.381
l'm in training. l want to break the world's record
for walking funny.


365
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.950
Now what about Pappas?

366
00:36:19.028 --> 00:36:23.897
l can't find out anything about Pappas. Every
drifter l mention him to, comes up with a zero.


367
00:36:23.966 --> 00:36:26.366
l've gone up to
a C-note. Nothing. No takers.

368
00:36:26.436 --> 00:36:28.063
What about Felix Montaigne?

369
00:36:28.137 --> 00:36:30.935
Like l told you, Montaigne, football player, right?
Ex-pro...


370
00:36:31.007 --> 00:36:32.440
...ex-all
-American--

371
00:36:32.508 --> 00:36:33.975
Yeah, you said that.

372
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.079
Anyway, three years ago,
the guy retires from pro football...


373
00:36:37.146 --> 00:36:40.775
...takes a job as Vice President
with Riveredge Export. One year later--


374
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.648
-Wait a minute. Riveredge Export?
-Yeah.


375
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.651
Down by the docks?

376
00:36:45.722 --> 00:36:48.088
Yeah. 23 Front Street. 
Does that ring a bell?

377
00:36:48.157 --> 00:36:50.216
Yeah. Pappas and his girlfriend worked there.

378
00:36:50.293 --> 00:36:52.386
Come on, help me with this shirt.

379
00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:55.431
One year later,
the guy buys complete ownership...


380
00:36:55.498 --> 00:36:57.796
...and becomes President of Riveredge.

381
00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:01.864
The guy is unmarried,
lives with his sister, a big-time model, Alexis.


382
00:37:01.938 --> 00:37:03.838
56 Sutton Place South.

383
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.835
The guy is a big spender.

384
00:37:07.844 --> 00:37:10.335
-ls that it?
-Well, yeah, you want more?


385
00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:12.178
Yeah, l want more.

386
00:37:13.015 --> 00:37:17.008
How does an ex-jock get the money
for Riveredge Export, and what does he export?


387
00:37:17.086 --> 00:37:18.144
Okay, l got it.

388
00:37:18.221 --> 00:37:21.088
l'll find out. 
And l'll keep checking on Pappas.

389
00:37:21.157 --> 00:37:23.352
We're really into something big now, huh?

390
00:37:23.526 --> 00:37:26.495
Listen, if anything happens, you get out.

391
00:37:26.863 --> 00:37:27.761
Yeah.

392
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.856
You hear what l'm saying?
lf anything happens, you get out.


393
00:37:30.933 --> 00:37:31.831
Okay.

394
00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:41.977
You don't think we're getting
into anything too big?


395
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.948
No.

396
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.159
Hello.

397
00:38:08.237 --> 00:38:11.400
l'm an old friend of Mr. Montaigne's.
l'd rather not be announced.


398
00:38:11.474 --> 00:38:13.942
-l'd kind of like to surprise him.
-The name, sir?


399
00:38:14.277 --> 00:38:17.576
-Mr. Green.
-Thank you. Penthouse A, sir.


400
00:38:18.314 --> 00:38:19.406
Thank you.

401
00:38:30.793 --> 00:38:32.021
Well, hello.

402
00:38:32.361 --> 00:38:34.625
-You must be kidding.
-No, l'm not.


403
00:38:35.298 --> 00:38:38.062
-Did you follow me last night?
-No, ma'am.


404
00:38:39.302 --> 00:38:41.167
How did you get past the doorman?

405
00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:44.229
Charmed him.
Charmed the old boy right out of his socks.


406
00:38:44.307 --> 00:38:46.867
You're selling door-to-door today?

407
00:38:46.943 --> 00:38:49.741
-No. My name is McCoy.
-Mr. McCoy, l have some advice.


408
00:38:49.812 --> 00:38:53.304
-You better go downstairs or l'm going--
-l'm a private detective.


409
00:38:55.685 --> 00:38:57.175
You are something.

410
00:38:57.587 --> 00:39:01.284
Yesterday a pervert, today a private detective.
Mr. McCoy, l'm....


411
00:39:03.926 --> 00:39:07.123
-What do you want?
-l want to see Felix Montaigne.


412
00:39:07.263 --> 00:39:10.198
l want to ask him some questions.
He wasn't in his office.


413
00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:12.427
No, he doesn't work on Saturdays.

414
00:39:13.703 --> 00:39:16.934
Maybe l can answer some questions for you.
l'm his sister.


415
00:39:17.974 --> 00:39:19.100
Yeah, maybe.

416
00:39:19.742 --> 00:39:21.004
Can l come in?

417
00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:25.774
Thank you.

418
00:39:33.656 --> 00:39:36.489
-Mr. McCoy, would you like to follow me?
-What?


419
00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:42.028
-ls Felix in some sort of trouble?
-Nope.


420
00:39:42.598 --> 00:39:45.123
l just want to ask
him a couple of questions.

421
00:39:46.836 --> 00:39:48.463
Felix, this is Mr. McCoy.

422
00:39:48.538 --> 00:39:51.530
He's a private detective.
He wants to ask you some questions.


423
00:39:51.607 --> 00:39:53.268
Hi. How do you do?

424
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.600
What can l do for you?

425
00:39:56.045 --> 00:39:59.811
l want to ask you about a former employer
of yours named Vic Pappas.


426
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:01.941
Who do you work for?

427
00:40:02.919 --> 00:40:05.114
Well, that's privileged information.

428
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.617
Look, what can you ask
that we haven't told the police already?


429
00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:13.184
Well, maybe nothing.

430
00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:16.262
But it might help me out
a lot, if you don't mind.

431
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.494
Okay.

432
00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:22.693
-Drink?
-Yeah. Vodka, no ice.


433
00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:30.237
Our records show Pappas came
to work for us about six months ago.


434
00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:32.572
Warehouse man. 
Rated: hard worker.

435
00:40:33.149 --> 00:40:34.810
Attitude: excellent.

436
00:40:35.418 --> 00:40:37.249
Habits: excellent.

437
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:41.882
Terry Brosten came to work
for Riveredge three years ago.


438
00:40:43.192 --> 00:40:45.092
Bookkeeper. Rated: excellent.

439
00:40:45.928 --> 00:40:47.486
Quiet, neat...

440
00:40:48.764 --> 00:40:50.664
...one of our best employees.

441
00:40:52.468 --> 00:40:54.629
No, we did not know
they were having an affair.

442
00:40:54.704 --> 00:40:58.572
Yes, we did know Pappas had a record.
But at dockside, that's no big thing.


443
00:41:01.611 --> 00:41:03.408
-Thank you.
-Anything else?


444
00:41:04.747 --> 00:41:06.681
John Bolton. Do you know him?

445
00:41:07.683 --> 00:41:09.674
The bouncer at the Health Club?

446
00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:13.779
-Yeah.
-Yeah, what about him?


447
00:41:13.956 --> 00:41:16.288
Did you know that
he and Pappas were friends?

448
00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:18.589
-John Bolton and Pappas?
-Yeah.


449
00:41:19.629 --> 00:41:21.654
No, l didn't.

450
00:41:23.466 --> 00:41:24.797
l guess that's all.

451
00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:26.630
-Good.
-Thank you.


452
00:41:26.702 --> 00:41:28.431
l'll show him out.

453
00:41:29.505 --> 00:41:30.938
One more thing.

454
00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.503
Are you the sole owner of Riveredge Export?

455
00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:36.442
l got a partner.

456
00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:39.780
-What's his name?
-Privileged information.


457
00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:51.588
-Lovely apartment you have here.
-Thank you, Mr. McCoy.


458
00:41:51.694 --> 00:41:53.889
Reminds me a great deal of mine.

459
00:42:45.781 --> 00:42:48.750
l see the cops are still using
the same high-powered...


460
00:42:48.818 --> 00:42:52.811
...scientific methods of gathering information
that have made them famous.


461
00:42:52.988 --> 00:42:56.515
-When in doubt, ask the family.
-Do you know this comedian?


462
00:42:56.592 --> 00:43:01.163
-Angie and l were dancing partners in fifth grade.
-Always welcome at Ponte's, McCoy.


463
00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:03.256
-ls the big man in?
-ln the kitchen.


464
00:43:03.566 --> 00:43:05.124
l was just telling Angie...

465
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:09.433
...that we figure it's somebody in the service
tied up into the Pappas killing.


466
00:43:09.505 --> 00:43:13.100
-No one else could get near a flamethrower.
-lt's the same thing l--


467
00:43:13.175 --> 00:43:14.870
Let's go see the Doctor.

468
00:43:33.796 --> 00:43:35.320
Gentlemen, welcome.

469
00:43:41.937 --> 00:43:42.904
McCoy.

470
00:43:45.875 --> 00:43:47.274
How's your mother?

471
00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:50.106
She passed away, last year.

472
00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:54.080
And you, <i>Dottore</i>?

473
00:43:55.084 --> 00:43:57.575
l survive. lt's not easy, you know.

474
00:43:59.255 --> 00:44:00.222
Come.

475
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.158
-Gentlemen, why don't you have some lunch?
-l don't think so, <i>Dottore</i>.


476
00:44:06.395 --> 00:44:09.125
Come on, have a glass of wine. McCoy?

477
00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:34.852
Gentlemen, <i>tagliatelle verdi all'amatriciana</i>.

478
00:44:35.124 --> 00:44:37.752
Afterwards the <i>aragosta</i>...

479
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.928
...and to make life complete...

480
00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:42.897
...<i>un buon</i> Verdicchio to bring out the flavor.

481
00:44:43.132 --> 00:44:44.292
<i>Buon appetitol</i>

482
00:45:01.784 --> 00:45:03.843
Now, how can l help you?

483
00:45:04.587 --> 00:45:06.020
The Pappas case.

484
00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:08.516
-Anything we should know.
-Angie?


485
00:45:09.158 --> 00:45:11.922
We don't touch it. 
Not our style.

486
00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:14.457
<i>Dottore</i>...

487
00:45:14.897 --> 00:45:18.264
...last night l got worked over
by a couple of professionals.


488
00:45:19.134 --> 00:45:21.034
They did a hell
of a job on me.

489
00:45:21.136 --> 00:45:24.162
l was wondering if maybe you might know
who they were.


490
00:45:24.907 --> 00:45:27.068
We have no quarrel with you, McCoy.

491
00:45:27.676 --> 00:45:30.440
lf our boys see you, you don't eat...

492
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.708
...or walk...

493
00:45:33.582 --> 00:45:35.675
...or shoot that beautiful pool.

494
00:45:42.524 --> 00:45:44.617
Check the torpedoes for McCoy.

495
00:45:49.765 --> 00:45:51.630
<i>Dottore</i>...

496
00:45:52.668 --> 00:45:56.126
...but we are running into a stone wall
on this Pappas thing.


497
00:45:56.639 --> 00:45:59.164
People downtown, they're pressing me.

498
00:46:02.645 --> 00:46:04.704
l know you two
since you threw a rock...

499
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.181
...through the window
of my brother Giuseppe's fruit store.


500
00:46:09.285 --> 00:46:11.014
You were wild boys.

501
00:46:11.921 --> 00:46:14.913
l was amazed the two
of you stayed out of jail.

502
00:46:15.324 --> 00:46:17.656
And now you're standup citizens.

503
00:46:20.296 --> 00:46:22.457
This could only happen in America.

504
00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:26.199
So l'm going to
tell you a little story.

505
00:46:29.672 --> 00:46:31.071
lf a person...

506
00:46:32.074 --> 00:46:33.439
...any person...

507
00:46:34.276 --> 00:46:38.212
...fools around with things
that shoot and explode...


508
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:42.008
...things their own government won't touch...

509
00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:44.310
...this person has a very good chance...

510
00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:47.514
...to wind up doing a permanent back-float
in the river.


511
00:46:48.223 --> 00:46:49.815
Gunrunning, munitions.

512
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.960
l was only telling a story.

513
00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:58.660
Pappas stole diamonds, not guns.

514
00:46:59.501 --> 00:47:02.493
Diamonds can be insured, books can't.

515
00:47:04.106 --> 00:47:07.075
-Books? What do you--
-l've said enough.


516
00:47:18.253 --> 00:47:20.687
-Do you know Felix Montaigne?
-Yeah.


517
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.386
-He's got a very pretty sister.
-No kidding?


518
00:47:26.562 --> 00:47:30.692
He also knows some tough boys
who visit at night.


519
00:47:40.142 --> 00:47:42.940
Well, l thank you for the information, <i>Dottore</i>.

520
00:47:44.013 --> 00:47:46.538
For the old days, and the old neighborhood.

521
00:47:49.018 --> 00:47:52.146
-You're not going to eat?
-l have a previous engagement.


522
00:47:53.389 --> 00:47:55.550
-Where you going?
-You stay and eat.


523
00:47:56.458 --> 00:47:57.857
Yeah. <i>Mangia, mangia.</i>

524
00:48:12.374 --> 00:48:14.501
Selling door-to-door now, are you?

525
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:17.503
l need to talk to you.

526
00:48:19.548 --> 00:48:21.846
-How did you get past the doorman?
-Okay.


527
00:48:23.886 --> 00:48:25.786
Are you going to invite me in?

528
00:48:32.461 --> 00:48:35.521
l'm sure that l was rude this morning,
and l apologize.


529
00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:37.655
Yes, you were.

530
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.305
-Charming apartment.
-Yes, it is.


531
00:48:44.373 --> 00:48:46.534
You want a drink? lt's over there.

532
00:48:46.675 --> 00:48:49.109
Hey, that's a terrific idea for a bed.

533
00:48:50.612 --> 00:48:53.911
-And that's where you keep score.
-As a matter of fact, yes.


534
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:59.350
McCoy, l want to hire you professionally.
Are you available?


535
00:48:59.555 --> 00:49:02.046
-What have you got in mind?
-Felix, my brother.


536
00:49:02.357 --> 00:49:04.951
l want you to follow him
or whatever it is you do.

537
00:49:05.027 --> 00:49:06.961
-You want an egg?
-No, thank you.


538
00:49:07.029 --> 00:49:10.487
l want to know where he goes,
what he does, and who he talks to.


539
00:49:11.733 --> 00:49:14.133
-Why?
-ls it necessary for you to know that?


540
00:49:14.203 --> 00:49:16.603
-Can't you just do your--
-lt is necessary.


541
00:49:16.672 --> 00:49:20.164
-What seems to be his problem?
-l don't even know that there is a problem.


542
00:49:20.242 --> 00:49:23.769
l'm worried about him
because he's been behaving very strangely lately.


543
00:49:23.846 --> 00:49:26.110
-Ever since the Pappas killing?
-Even before.


544
00:49:26.181 --> 00:49:29.378
He is a changed man, you know.
He's jumpy, he's irritable.


545
00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:32.648
When l walk into the room,
he breaks off telephone conversations.


546
00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:34.621
He never used to do that. You see....

547
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.454
-What are you going to do with that?
-That is club soda.


548
00:49:37.526 --> 00:49:39.858
-lt holds the eggs together.
-You mustn't do that.


549
00:49:39.928 --> 00:49:42.123
-What do you mean?
-You can't put club soda in it.


550
00:49:42.197 --> 00:49:43.960
That makes them very runny.

551
00:49:44.032 --> 00:49:47.559
-My sainted mother taught me that.
-Your mother taught you that?


552
00:49:47.636 --> 00:49:50.469
Who's your brother's partner at Riveredge?

553
00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:51.597
l don't know.

554
00:49:51.673 --> 00:49:53.140
-You don't know?
-l don't know.


555
00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:56.939
Felix was a big football star.
You know how it is with big football players?


556
00:49:57.012 --> 00:49:59.344
A lot of people want things.
You know what l mean?


557
00:49:59.414 --> 00:50:00.312
No.

558
00:50:00.382 --> 00:50:02.714
-Do you want this job or don't you?
-Go on.


559
00:50:02.784 --> 00:50:05.150
One of these men, and
l don't know his name...

560
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.381
...gave Felix the money to buy Riveredge.

561
00:50:07.456 --> 00:50:09.287
Look how pretty they are. Cheese?

562
00:50:09.358 --> 00:50:10.347
-No.
-Sorry.


563
00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:14.361
-How are they doing financially?
-Profits are up 30 percent since Felix took over.


564
00:50:15.531 --> 00:50:18.125
-What do they export?
-Well, what do you mean?


565
00:50:18.734 --> 00:50:20.463
l mean, what do they export?

566
00:50:20.536 --> 00:50:23.164
Munitions? Arms?

567
00:50:24.573 --> 00:50:28.100
l don't.... l don't know.
What does that have to do with anything?


568
00:50:29.678 --> 00:50:31.873
Anybody at their warehouse on Sunday?

569
00:50:32.147 --> 00:50:33.375
Not that l know of. Why?

570
00:50:33.448 --> 00:50:36.008
Your brother mention anything
about a special book?


571
00:50:36.084 --> 00:50:36.914
No. What book?

572
00:50:36.985 --> 00:50:39.180
-l don't know. You know what?
-What?


573
00:50:40.289 --> 00:50:42.018
You got a great lower lip.

574
00:50:43.525 --> 00:50:46.050
l get $75 a day, plus expenses.

575
00:50:47.229 --> 00:50:50.630
Three day minimum, half in advance.
lt's $112.50.


576
00:50:56.872 --> 00:50:58.601
All l have is $85.

577
00:51:06.181 --> 00:51:08.615
We could work the rest
out on the pool table.

578
00:51:08.684 --> 00:51:10.015
-You know what?
-What?


579
00:51:10.085 --> 00:51:11.916
l don't like your mustache.

580
00:51:12.287 --> 00:51:13.720
You want me to call you a cab?

581
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:15.984
lt's not necessary. l'm parked right in front.

582
00:51:16.058 --> 00:51:18.151
Am l going to get a daily report?

583
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.503
McCoy, come on out.

584
00:55:29.044 --> 00:55:30.773
Make it easy on yourself.

585
00:55:32.414 --> 00:55:33.847
There's no way out.

586
00:55:36.418 --> 00:55:39.751
All right, l'm coming out.

587
00:56:19.494 --> 00:56:22.327
-He's not on it.
-What do you mean he's not on it?


588
00:56:23.965 --> 00:56:25.227
Get out front.

589
00:57:43.178 --> 00:57:44.304
There he is.

590
00:58:45.473 --> 00:58:48.033
ln a contest for the world bantamweight crown...

591
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:50.907
...one Vic Toweel knocked down
a Danny O'Sullivan...


592
00:58:50.979 --> 00:58:53.277
...a record 14 times in 10 rounds.

593
00:58:54.716 --> 00:58:56.707
Mr. O'Sullivan then retired.

594
00:58:58.787 --> 00:59:00.584
Son of a gun! Gin.

595
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.458
December 2, 1950, South Africa.

596
00:59:05.794 --> 00:59:08.524
-You look awful.
-Thank you.


597
00:59:10.065 --> 00:59:11.191
Any calls?

598
00:59:11.266 --> 00:59:15.635
A guy called 15 minutes ago.
l told him you weren't here, and he hung up.


599
00:59:17.172 --> 00:59:20.835
How about the back room?
You want to get a couple of hours of shuteye?


600
00:59:21.142 --> 00:59:22.632
No, l'm going home.

601
00:59:23.545 --> 00:59:27.106
-You have got something for me, right?
-Wrong.


602
00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:31.812
l can't even rouse the guy
that's the janitor at Riveredge.


603
00:59:31.886 --> 00:59:33.285
lt's embarrassing.

604
00:59:33.521 --> 00:59:36.490
l've got to know who put up the dough
for Riveredge Export.


605
00:59:36.558 --> 00:59:38.856
-You understand?
-l can't promise you anything.


606
00:59:38.927 --> 00:59:41.122
You are worthless to me, totally worthless.

607
00:59:41.196 --> 00:59:43.687
l'm not. l'm not looking for any medals
on this one.


608
00:59:43.765 --> 00:59:45.357
Listen to me. Listen.

609
00:59:46.034 --> 00:59:47.763
Can you make a phone call?

610
00:59:48.136 --> 00:59:50.161
-You call Vinnie.
-Lieutenant Promuto.


611
00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:52.900
-Tell him to go to Riveredge Export.
-23 Front Street.


612
00:59:52.974 --> 00:59:56.239
Tell him the joint is full
of military hardware and a stiff.


613
00:59:56.678 --> 00:59:59.203
A stiff? lf there's a
stiff in this, l'm not--

614
00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.440
Do it!

615
01:00:28.943 --> 01:00:31.434
Don't you ever go out and fool around?

616
01:01:23.498 --> 01:01:24.988
McCoy?

617
01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:41.372
Yeah?

618
01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.314
lt's Alexis Montaigne.

619
01:01:44.085 --> 01:01:46.883
-What do you want?
-l want to talk to you.


620
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:51.217
Are you alone?

621
01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:52.816
Yes, of course.

622
01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:05.495
lt's unlocked.

623
01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:12.739
McCoy?

624
01:02:17.085 --> 01:02:19.781
Aren't you overdoing it a little bit?

625
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:23.450
-Hello there.
-Hi.


626
01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:26.084
What do you want?

627
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:29.726
Well, you said that l was going to get
a daily report.


628
01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:33.824
And you didn't call,
then l tried to call you and couldn't get you...


629
01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:36.166
...and so l came
over here to get it.

630
01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:39.232
-You came out here for a daily report?
-Yes.


631
01:02:40.241 --> 01:02:42.209
l don't work on Sundays, lady.

632
01:02:42.377 --> 01:02:44.402
You don't work on Sundays?

633
01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:46.068
Nope.

634
01:02:46.147 --> 01:02:49.082
l have hired me a detective
who doesn't work on Sundays.


635
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:50.947
l'm a very religious person.

636
01:02:51.786 --> 01:02:54.846
How about a little light,
or does your religion forbid that, too?


637
01:02:54.956 --> 01:02:58.824
Well, l would prefer candles.
Since you're a nonbeliever.


638
01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:07.491
-What did you expect? White tie and tails?
-All you need is a cape and a whip.


639
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.078
Sure you have all
the protection you need there?

640
01:03:21.149 --> 01:03:23.140
You know what New York streets are like.

641
01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:26.186
l don't know,
she doesn't look like she needs any protection.


642
01:03:26.254 --> 01:03:28.415
She's an ''A'' protection, she's flat-chested.

643
01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:35.690
Well, what a pretty cat.
Hello, cat. What's your name?


644
01:03:35.863 --> 01:03:36.522
Cat.

645
01:03:36.597 --> 01:03:39.065
Cat. That makes sense. 
He belongs to you?

646
01:03:39.133 --> 01:03:41.567
Well, we share the same apartment.

647
01:03:41.803 --> 01:03:44.169
-lt looks like you.
-Yeah, a little.


648
01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.899
Hello, pretty cat.

649
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:12.788
This is a very important confession,
and l don't want you to laugh.


650
01:04:13.101 --> 01:04:16.298
When we were making love,
l had this tremendous urge.


651
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:22.140
Well, l wanted to see if my legs would fit
in the side pockets.


652
01:04:24.712 --> 01:04:28.148
My feet, so l could keep them warm.
l think it's nutty.


653
01:04:29.617 --> 01:04:30.811
You, too?

654
01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:37.890
Well, l'll tell you. l got this....

655
01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:41.658
l got this friend of
mine, his name is Springy.

656
01:04:42.296 --> 01:04:45.390
He's a funny little guy, red hair. 
You'll meet him.

657
01:04:46.034 --> 01:04:48.559
He's got a photographic memory, see?

658
01:04:49.704 --> 01:04:53.640
He remembers all kinds of things.
Statistics and stuff, you know?


659
01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:55.699
You know what he told me?

660
01:04:56.077 --> 01:04:58.944
He said that any woman...

661
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:03.414
...who has a secret urge to stick her feet
in the side pockets...


662
01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:07.347
...is sexually frustrated.

663
01:05:08.256 --> 01:05:09.416
That's me.

664
01:05:09.957 --> 01:05:11.549
-That's me.
-That's you?


665
01:05:11.626 --> 01:05:13.253
That was me.

666
01:05:26.274 --> 01:05:27.605
Yeah?

667
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:31.576
Yeah, Heavy. Go.

668
01:05:37.518 --> 01:05:42.979
Well, you tell Mr. E.J. Hume
that l won't go up to Westchester tonight.


669
01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:45.852
Tell him, if he wants to see me...

670
01:05:45.927 --> 01:05:49.055
...l'll meet him in your place
at 10:00 in the morning...


671
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:52.691
...and then hang up
on him. You got it?

672
01:05:55.503 --> 01:05:56.629
Thanks, Heav.

673
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.640
-You sure are tough.
-Yes, l am.


674
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:02.869
Tough man.

675
01:06:04.745 --> 01:06:06.007
You know him?

676
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.412
-Whom?
-Not whom. Hume.


677
01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:09.811
-Hume?
-E.J. Hume.


678
01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.681
The E.J. Hume? 
The multi-millionaire?

679
01:06:11.752 --> 01:06:13.652
-You met him, right?
-No, never met him.


680
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:15.450
-No?
-No.


681
01:06:15.523 --> 01:06:19.220
-What about Felix? He ever met him?
-Not that l know of. Why?


682
01:06:19.293 --> 01:06:22.091
-You sure?
-Yeah, l don't know him, why?


683
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.230
Tell me a little bit about your brother.

684
01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:27.699
My big, adorable, handsome brother.

685
01:06:27.935 --> 01:06:29.766
Don't you agree with that?

686
01:06:30.738 --> 01:06:32.763
l don't know, l mean....

687
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.999
We've been very close for a long time.

688
01:06:35.076 --> 01:06:38.273
Our folks died when l
was 12 and he was 8.

689
01:06:39.013 --> 01:06:42.141
He helped me through a bad marriage
and a divorce and everything.


690
01:06:42.216 --> 01:06:45.310
lt was really hard for him
when he tried to give up football.


691
01:06:45.386 --> 01:06:47.616
He tried hard to
find himself, and he did.

692
01:06:47.688 --> 01:06:50.384
He's done crazy things, but
he's still a good guy.

693
01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:52.449
-Will you kiss me?
-That's your....


694
01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:05.732
What are you doing?

695
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:11.635
Got to work my way through the brush
to get to the picnic grounds.


696
01:07:37.371 --> 01:07:38.861
He's in there.

697
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:45.001
He's got help.

698
01:07:55.556 --> 01:07:57.183
Well, the Brothers Grimm.

699
01:07:57.258 --> 01:07:59.954
Mr. McCoy, you have quite a flair
for the melodramatic.


700
01:08:00.027 --> 01:08:00.857
Thanks.

701
01:08:00.928 --> 01:08:04.193
Nice place for a meeting. 
Dirty, hot....

702
01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:11.136
The last time, l froze my ass off.

703
01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:13.735
This time you sweat.

704
01:08:13.808 --> 01:08:18.006
Mr. McCoy, when you accepted this assignment,
you were told to report each day.


705
01:08:18.079 --> 01:08:19.410
And l didn't.

706
01:08:20.548 --> 01:08:22.106
Well, l'm off this case.

707
01:08:23.217 --> 01:08:26.744
You see, l never really was on it.
Not the real case.


708
01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:28.448
Was l?

709
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.791
Here's your money back, minus $400.

710
01:08:34.061 --> 01:08:35.494
Expenses.

711
01:08:36.564 --> 01:08:37.895
l'll see you around.

712
01:08:37.965 --> 01:08:41.628
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
l haven't said you were off the case.


713
01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:44.694
l'm entitled to know
what you've uncovered up until now.


714
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.501
You're entitled to nothing.

715
01:08:46.607 --> 01:08:47.869
Nothing!

716
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:51.745
You got a complaint,
you take it up with the State Board of Licenses.


717
01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:53.541
And one more thing.

718
01:08:54.282 --> 01:08:57.274
l want to apologize in
case l lose my temper.

719
01:08:57.618 --> 01:09:01.554
Because if l do lose it,
l'm going to kick the hell out of somebody.


720
01:09:01.622 --> 01:09:04.523
You have a very refreshing sense of humor.

721
01:09:04.992 --> 01:09:07.222
All right, you're off the case.

722
01:09:07.295 --> 01:09:09.195
l never lose my temper...

723
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:13.191
...but if l ever
should, l want to apologize.

724
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:33.051
-Nice friends you got there.
-Yeah, beautiful.


725
01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:37.351
-Vinnie been looking for me?
-No.


726
01:09:38.059 --> 01:09:40.459
-Did Springy check in?
-Not yet.


727
01:09:40.895 --> 01:09:43.728
When he checks in,
tell him the deal's off.

728
01:09:45.066 --> 01:09:48.297
And tell him to stay here.
l'll call you in an hour.

729
01:09:48.369 --> 01:09:49.563
Got it.

730
01:10:06.721 --> 01:10:10.782
-l don't believe we've been formally introduced.
-Shut up, smart ass.


731
01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:50.096
l want to show you something.

732
01:10:57.571 --> 01:11:00.096
Hey, fellow, hold it a second.

733
01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:13.911
Oh, my God!

734
01:11:31.038 --> 01:11:33.836
We got a guy. Sector car made him
running a red light...


735
01:11:33.908 --> 01:11:35.773
...about a half a mile from here.

736
01:11:36.243 --> 01:11:38.268
There was blood on his jacket.

737
01:11:38.345 --> 01:11:39.607
Anything?

738
01:11:40.214 --> 01:11:41.613
He's a clam.

739
01:11:42.183 --> 01:11:44.777
Hey, man, let's see your pretty face.

740
01:11:48.022 --> 01:11:49.785
Come on, turn, look.

741
01:11:51.525 --> 01:11:52.992
Do you know him?

742
01:12:12.413 --> 01:12:13.744
Watch him.

743
01:12:19.854 --> 01:12:21.822
You know him, don't you?

744
01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:32.498
Okay, last night you have Springy call me
and run me out to Riveredge Export.


745
01:12:32.733 --> 01:12:36.066
Guns, munitions all over the joint,
he said, and a dead body.


746
01:12:36.136 --> 01:12:39.003
You know what l found? Nothing.

747
01:12:39.673 --> 01:12:42.073
That's right, a great big naught.

748
01:12:42.977 --> 01:12:44.945
That damn watchman thinks l'm a nut.

749
01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:47.173
-You want to tell me about that?
-No.


750
01:12:47.248 --> 01:12:48.943
Who the hell do you think you are?

751
01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:54.044
Do you think this is some credit checkout
some shyster lawyer throws your way?


752
01:12:55.422 --> 01:12:59.051
You try to take this alone,
and you'll end up in a bag, too.


753
01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:09.092
-Hello.
-Where's your brother?


754
01:13:09.203 --> 01:13:11.194
l don't know. He hasn't been around.

755
01:13:11.272 --> 01:13:14.002
Don't give me any crap. 
Now where is he?

756
01:13:14.308 --> 01:13:16.970
l haven't seen him since last Saturday.

757
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.310
Now, would you care
to tell me what's wrong?

758
01:13:22.383 --> 01:13:25.944
You remember that little redheaded guy
that l told you about? Springy?


759
01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.078
Yes.

760
01:13:28.722 --> 01:13:32.214
They found him this morning. 
His throat was cut.

761
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.361
Oh, no. l'm so sorry.

762
01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:40.662
What does that have to do with Felix?
l mean....


763
01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:44.671
You don't think
that Felix had something to do with that?


764
01:13:44.772 --> 01:13:46.069
You bet l do.

765
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.903
Well, you're wrong.
Felix wouldn't have anything to do with that.


766
01:13:50.277 --> 01:13:54.008
l busted into his warehouse, opened some crates.
You know what l found?


767
01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:56.845
A dead body with a
bullet hole through the head.

768
01:13:57.585 --> 01:13:58.984
A dead body?

769
01:13:59.987 --> 01:14:01.454
That's not all.

770
01:14:01.655 --> 01:14:05.887
-lllegal military hardware, machine guns.
-What does that mean?


771
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.361
l don't know what it means.
How the hell do l know what it means.


772
01:14:19.673 --> 01:14:22.301
Did you ever hear
of a Lieutenant Colonel C.C. Hardcore?


773
01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:24.936
Of course. He has
dinner here all the time.

774
01:14:25.579 --> 01:14:29.845
He and Felix have business dealings together,
so we have to entertain him often.


775
01:14:30.084 --> 01:14:31.881
He's a weird man.

776
01:14:35.289 --> 01:14:38.315
-When was the last time you saw him?
-l don't know.


777
01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:42.294
They talk on the telephone all the time.
They make dates.


778
01:14:44.131 --> 01:14:46.326
-You got his phone number?
-No.


779
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.196
l don't know.
Maybe Felix has it in his book.


780
01:14:53.774 --> 01:14:55.241
Will you see?

781
01:15:08.856 --> 01:15:10.881
-Here it is.
-Will you call him?


782
01:15:10.958 --> 01:15:14.724
-l don't see what this has to do with--
-Will you call him for me, please?


783
01:15:26.607 --> 01:15:28.837
Tell him Felix is out of town.

784
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:31.871
Tell him you're calling
for a very good friend.

785
01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:35.472
-Colonel Hardcore, please.
-Tell him the friend's name is Burns.


786
01:15:35.549 --> 01:15:38.279
Colonel Hardcore, please. 
Alexis Montaigne.

787
01:15:38.652 --> 01:15:40.552
You have to see him right away.

788
01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:44.421
Colonel Hardcore.... 
You are very sweet.

789
01:15:45.192 --> 01:15:48.650
Colonel, Felix is not in town.
Now, he's away, but...


790
01:15:48.729 --> 01:15:52.961
...a friend of his has arrived unexpectedly,
and Felix would like you to meet him.


791
01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:55.528
-Tonight?
-Now.


792
01:15:55.636 --> 01:16:00.300
No, you see, my friend is very anxious,
and he'd like to come out now if that's possible.


793
01:16:00.741 --> 01:16:02.231
Burns.

794
01:16:03.043 --> 01:16:04.806
Oh, that's terrific!

795
01:16:05.045 --> 01:16:07.445
We'll be right there. Thank you.

796
01:16:25.432 --> 01:16:26.660
-Mr. Burns?
-Yeah.


797
01:16:26.734 --> 01:16:29.294
The Colonel's been waiting. 
Right this way.

798
01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.063
-You stay here.
-l want to go with you.


799
01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:34.664
l know you do,
but stay here anyway. Sit.

800
01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:41.071
Thank you.

801
01:16:48.856 --> 01:16:50.483
Colonel Hardcore.

802
01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:53.625
That was the last real war.

803
01:16:54.728 --> 01:16:56.593
Now, what can l
do for you, my boy?

804
01:16:56.663 --> 01:16:59.632
-Well, l represent a--
-Well, you saw action, did you?


805
01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:01.600
Which theater?

806
01:17:02.336 --> 01:17:03.803
Korea. Airborne.

807
01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:05.133
-ls that right?
-Yeah.


808
01:17:05.205 --> 01:17:07.196
You one of them glamour boys?

809
01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:10.643
-Tough, wasn't it, son?
-Yeah.


810
01:17:10.911 --> 01:17:14.711
l was with old Georgie Patton himself,
in the Third Army.


811
01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:19.252
l kept the tanks
moving come snow or mud.

812
01:17:20.387 --> 01:17:22.412
Georgie used to say:

813
01:17:22.656 --> 01:17:26.649
''When l die, l'll go to Heaven...

814
01:17:28.862 --> 01:17:31.262
''...because l've already been to Hell.''

815
01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:35.967
Yeah. Colonel Hardcore.

816
01:17:37.271 --> 01:17:38.602
Colonel.

817
01:17:39.173 --> 01:17:42.040
l represent this group of people
who are very interested...


818
01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:46.168
...in making a bid on some
of this surplus material you have here.


819
01:17:52.753 --> 01:17:57.884
Felix Montaigne told me that you were the man
that could get the job done.


820
01:18:12.639 --> 01:18:14.163
Let's move out.

821
01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:20.504
Yes, sir.
l'll check the files immediately. Right.


822
01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:26.450
-My dear Alexis.
-Colonel Hardcore.


823
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.911
Honored to see you again.

824
01:18:29.423 --> 01:18:30.856
lt's nice to see you, too.

825
01:18:58.452 --> 01:19:00.818
What we have here is two-inch armor plate!

826
01:19:00.888 --> 01:19:05.689
We're talking dual-operating, synchronized,
self-feeding, .50-caliber machine guns.


827
01:19:05.759 --> 01:19:08.785
We're talking about a 90-millimeter,
tank-armor-piercing gun...


828
01:19:08.862 --> 01:19:11.854
...with a range of up to seven miles.
How's that for kill power?


829
01:19:11.932 --> 01:19:14.730
Talk about speed.
Top speed: 45 miles per hour.


830
01:19:14.801 --> 01:19:17.929
Four-wheel drive, full threads,
electric fan, air conditioning...


831
01:19:18.005 --> 01:19:20.940
...all included as standard equipment.
Come on.


832
01:19:29.082 --> 01:19:30.982
Now this little baby right here...

833
01:19:31.084 --> 01:19:33.518
...the newly-developed,
armored personnel carrier.


834
01:19:33.587 --> 01:19:36.420
Designed to transport 12 persons and a driver.

835
01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:40.756
This unit is amphibious,
and can cross inland, lakes, and streams.


836
01:19:40.894 --> 01:19:44.921
-Terrific.
-Closest thing to a masterpiece there is.


837
01:19:45.499 --> 01:19:47.592
How much does one of these babies cost?

838
01:19:47.668 --> 01:19:50.034
$65,000 per unit.

839
01:19:50.103 --> 01:19:51.263
For an APC?

840
01:19:51.338 --> 01:19:53.670
Accompanying ordnance
with commensurate prices.


841
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.173
lt's the only way.

842
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:59.372
-Well, that's a little steep, Colonel.
-What?


843
01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:03.678
-l said, that's a little steep.
-This is war material, boy. Not no....


844
01:20:06.687 --> 01:20:08.587
You sure you're on the level?

845
01:20:08.655 --> 01:20:10.782
l'll let you in on a secret.

846
01:20:10.857 --> 01:20:13.348
-l've been approached before--
-You've been had.


847
01:20:13.427 --> 01:20:15.952
The cops know about Riveredge
and about the guns.


848
01:20:16.029 --> 01:20:18.293
Your brother promised me this wouldn't happen.

849
01:20:18.365 --> 01:20:21.095
Now you got one chance.
You'd better make a deal.


850
01:20:21.168 --> 01:20:23.500
-You promised.
-Tell me about that code book.


851
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:26.562
He said this would never happen.
Now, he promised.


852
01:20:53.667 --> 01:20:55.498
What are you doing?

853
01:21:00.807 --> 01:21:01.865
Halt!

854
01:21:01.975 --> 01:21:04.102
Pull over! Halt!

855
01:21:05.078 --> 01:21:06.102
Halt, damn it!

856
01:21:19.826 --> 01:21:21.851
Will you let me out of this truck?

857
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:33.071
Hang on!

858
01:21:37.344 --> 01:21:39.175
Somebody's coming.

859
01:21:47.954 --> 01:21:49.251
Halt! Stop!

860
01:22:29.963 --> 01:22:31.328
Hang on!

861
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.325
Here's the keys to my apartment.

862
01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:07.628
When you arrive call Lt. Promuto, 
Brooklyn West.

863
01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:11.728
Tell him to go to E.J. Hume's estate.
He knows where it is. You got that?


864
01:23:12.906 --> 01:23:15.568
Wait. l haven't got any money or anything.

865
01:23:17.777 --> 01:23:20.610
-Here's a subway token.
-Subway token.


866
01:23:24.284 --> 01:23:25.751
Take a cab.

867
01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.401
Drop it!

868
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:05.871
Kick it over here.

869
01:26:10.483 --> 01:26:12.713
Put your hands over your head.

870
01:26:16.923 --> 01:26:19.323
Over there against the fireplace.

871
01:26:20.827 --> 01:26:22.590
You, too, ape-shape.

872
01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.589
Don't misunderstand this, McCoy.

873
01:26:25.665 --> 01:26:26.927
Sit down.

874
01:26:31.838 --> 01:26:33.931
Put your hands on the desk.

875
01:26:44.718 --> 01:26:47.812
What have you been beating up
on poor Felix for?


876
01:26:48.822 --> 01:26:51.586
You could've left him in this room.
He'd have froze to death.


877
01:26:51.658 --> 01:26:55.287
This man has confessed to instigating
the murder of Pappas and his woman.


878
01:26:55.362 --> 01:27:00.129
He has admitted to the murder of Amos Ryan,
sergeant, U.S. Army flamethrower expert.


879
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.261
Mr. Montaigne has told us
where the stolen diamonds were hidden...


880
01:27:04.337 --> 01:27:05.895
...and we've recovered them.

881
01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:10.170
-l'm prepared to give you the agreed upon fee--
-Let me ask you something.


882
01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:12.905
How long has Felix been here?

883
01:27:15.615 --> 01:27:17.583
Since yesterday morning.

884
01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:19.541
ls that right?

885
01:27:19.953 --> 01:27:21.580
Get out of there.

886
01:27:25.325 --> 01:27:28.317
lf he's been here since yesterday morning...

887
01:27:29.295 --> 01:27:32.662
...then you must have given the order
to have Springy's throat cut.


888
01:27:36.202 --> 01:27:38.500
Now you get me that code book.

889
01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:49.041
Samson!

890
01:28:06.065 --> 01:28:09.228
l gave you a chance to save your life,
Mr. McCoy.


891
01:28:09.636 --> 01:28:11.763
But you're a persistent man.

892
01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:15.839
-What do we do now?
-Just proceed with our plans for Felix.


893
01:28:15.909 --> 01:28:19.003
Only now we add Mr. 
McCoy to the festivities.

894
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.110
l got a lot of
friends that know l'm here.

895
01:28:23.183 --> 01:28:25.879
Yes, but l doubt they'll ever find you.

896
01:28:46.139 --> 01:28:47.766
Samson!

897
01:29:05.925 --> 01:29:08.951
What the hell is going on here?

898
01:29:09.028 --> 01:29:11.121
Get the dogs separated!

899
01:29:13.399 --> 01:29:15.629
-Where's McCoy?
-He went through the woods.


900
01:29:15.702 --> 01:29:19.001
You idiot! Call the gate
and tell them to lock it.

901
01:35:14.694 --> 01:35:16.059
-Hi.
-Hi.


902
01:35:17.029 --> 01:35:21.295
-Lieutenant Promuto, E.J. Hume.
-l'd like to contact my lawyer.


903
01:35:21.367 --> 01:35:23.801
There's a cabinet behind his desk.

904
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:26.962
ln it you'll find that code book
the <i>Dottore</i> told us about.


905
01:35:27.106 --> 01:35:29.802
l have a right to
talk to my lawyer, mister.

906
01:35:29.942 --> 01:35:31.204
Sergeant...

907
01:35:33.179 --> 01:35:36.546
...give him his rights,
call his lawyer, book him.

908
01:35:47.894 --> 01:35:49.327
You look a mess.

909
01:35:49.395 --> 01:35:52.887
l don't feel so
good either. l'll see you.

910
01:35:54.467 --> 01:35:57.834
Mac, you coming for dinner?

911
01:36:28.768 --> 01:36:29.792
Hi.

912
01:36:34.206 --> 01:36:36.003
Did you hear about Felix?

913
01:36:37.176 --> 01:36:38.700
Promuto called.

914
01:36:41.981 --> 01:36:43.141
l'm sorry.

915
01:37:02.468 --> 01:37:03.799
Coming back?

916
01:37:04.804 --> 01:37:07.034
l don't know. Not right away.

917
01:37:07.373 --> 01:37:08.931
l....

918
01:37:10.042 --> 01:37:12.670
l don't want you to
go out of my life.
