Madam Ye! We must take
the kids and leave!


11
00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:53.949
Now. To the basement.

- [clamoring]
- Move fast.

[man] Here you go.

20
00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.787
Huh?

21
00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:30.989
Manguan Xue?

22
00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.759
Because I lost this darn place to you,
it doesn't mean you can lock me out.


23
00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:37.763
- Come on.

[bird squeaks]

27
00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:48.572
Did it give you a big scare?

28
00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:50.106
[Lucky] Uh-uh.

29
00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:51.978
Don't worry, boy.
This tea house is still ours.


30
00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:54.276
Even though
their name's on the door.


31
00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:55.612
We won it fair and square.

Hey, hey, honey.

40
00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:16.034
Tell me then, Yaogu Xue.

41
00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.669
What were you secretly discussing
in the tea room earlier?


42
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:20.573
Ah... Oh.

43
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.107
Why would I tell you?

44
00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:25.674
Well, why would you have
any reason not to tell me?

How many pilots
do we have left?


49
00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:19.364
Fifteen left, sir.

50
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.099
How many planes?

51
00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.070
Thirteen I-16s, one I-15,
two in repair.


52
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.739
We're recruiting
as we speak, sir.


53
00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:31.176
We are soldiers, Colonel. Protecting
our country in war is our job.


54
00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:32.842
I know how you feel.

55
00:05:32.844 --> 00:05:34.878
You have to be rational.

56
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.850
Can't just send these kids
up there to get shot down.


57
00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.885
I need you two. Both of you.

58
00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:42.655
If we don't take action,

59
00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:45.790
the Japanese will continue
to bomb Chongqing.


60
00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:47.325
How could we face our people?

61
00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:49.294
We need more planes.

62
00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.897
And we need to get those kids
out there trained.


63
00:05:52.263 --> 00:05:53.398
Nobody flies today.

64
00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:56.102
Sir?

65
00:05:57.368 --> 00:05:59.070
Please allow us
to go kick some ass.


66
00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:15.988
Let's go!

67
00:06:32.503 --> 00:06:35.138
We're barely making a dent.
How do we take them out?


68
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.342
Shoot the fuel tanks.

69
00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:52.424
Yeah!

70
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.969
- What kind of planes are those, Captain?
- The new Zeros.


71
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:06.171
Argh!

72
00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.909
Watch out! Incoming for you.

73
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:12.777
[groans]

74
00:07:16.847 --> 00:07:17.917
No!

75
00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:25.491
I can't shake this guy.

76
00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:27.993
I got you covered.

77
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.373
Lei Tao!

78
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.478
My brother, I'm not gonna
make it back for dinner.


79
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.181
Lei Tao!

80
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:02.360
Ugh!

Ten-hut!

I promise
to avenge you, brother.

Vice-captain Gangtou Xue,

91
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.994
Reporting from the 4th Battalion.
At your service.


92
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.962
[officer] <i>Captain Xue, since you
are unable to fight due to injury,</i>


93
00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:22.632
<i>the air force has loaned you
to us for a special mission.</i>


94
00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:25.100
[Gangtou] <i>I'm at your command,
sir.</i>


95
00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:27.202
[officer] <i>Tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.,
you will go down to the port</i>


96
00:10:27.204 --> 00:10:30.376
<i>and take truck 82560
back to Chongqing.</i>


97
00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.675
<i>The Japanese planes
are patrolling the roads,</i>


98
00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:34.409
<i>firing upon
anything that moves.</i>


99
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:36.646
<i>It is extremely dangerous.</i>

100
00:10:36.648 --> 00:10:39.081
[Gangtou] <i>I understand, sir.</i>

101
00:10:39.083 --> 00:10:42.250
[officer] <i>Your mission is to ensure that
truck gets to Chongqing in one piece.</i>


102
00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:44.289

[scream]

106
00:11:19.256 --> 00:11:20.191
Gangtou?

107
00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:21.659
Little Cui?

108
00:11:22.327 --> 00:11:24.494
What in heaven's name
is going on?


109
00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:26.999
I'm supposed to safeguard this truck.
I didn't expect to see you.


110
00:11:39.077 --> 00:11:40.111
[groans]

[grunts]

112
00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:50.990
Go over there.

113
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.258
[groans]

114
00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:56.528
Drive straight on through.

115
00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:03.168
[Jack] Pilots of China,

116
00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:07.171
we have reached a very critical
time in this war with the Japanese.


117
00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.672
I don't expect any of you new
trainees to get up there


118
00:12:10.674 --> 00:12:12.742
and take down
every Zero you see,


119
00:12:12.744 --> 00:12:15.445
but I do want you to take
this training very seriously.


120
00:12:15.447 --> 00:12:16.347
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:16.814 --> 00:12:19.217
We are here to avenge
our family and comrades.


122
00:12:20.184 --> 00:12:21.352
Who told you to speak?

123
00:12:22.654 --> 00:12:24.088
That's not why you're here.

124
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:27.289
You are here
to protect your families,


125
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:30.192
your mothers, your fathers,
your children,


126
00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:33.097
from having the bombs dropped
on them from the Japanese.


127
00:12:33.363 --> 00:12:34.563
That's your job.

128
00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:36.132
What do you know
about these planes?


129
00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:37.566
I know I can put up a fight.

130
00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:40.039
I know that once you reach
the combat zone,


131
00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:43.241
you have a very short
life expectancy.


132
00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:46.711
Five days, if that.

133
00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:51.582
I don't wanna be attending your funeral
or any of these men's funerals.


134
00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:54.218
At ease.

135
00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:58.253
This Yank thinks he's a hardass.
Don't take it personally.


136
00:12:58.255 --> 00:13:00.425
So you're
the new target practice?


137
00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:02.093
Huh?

138
00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:08.734
Think shooting Zeros is easy?

139
00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:10.435
You think it's a piece of cake?

140
00:13:14.338 --> 00:13:15.773
He's worse than the American.

141
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.313
Let's go.

142
00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:23.481
Hold on.

143
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.148
You're hiding something.

144
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.218
Why do you say that?

145
00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:31.420
What's in this truck?

146
00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:32.324
Medicine.

147
00:13:34.192 --> 00:13:36.191
I know you're lying.
What's in there?


148
00:13:36.193 --> 00:13:37.159
I told you.

149
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:38.296
You think I'm naive, huh?

150
00:13:39.764 --> 00:13:41.567
Gangtou? Gangtou!

151
00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:46.638
Gangtou, do not open that!

152
00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:48.473
They'll court-martial you.

153
00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:50.508
Where's your soldier's honor?

154
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.345
Medicine, huh?

155
00:13:57.347 --> 00:13:58.784
Why can't you just believe what
somebody tells you for once?


156
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.486
I told you the deal.

157
00:14:00.784 --> 00:14:03.322
I get my wife once I deliver.

158
00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:07.558
And I'm entering
the mahjong contest.


159
00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:11.229
I'm gonna win back our tea
house once and for all.


160
00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:14.931
So you have a plan
to beat my sister-in-law?


161
00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:18.201
Ha! She's just a cheater and a bragger.
Everyone knows how she won.


162
00:14:18.203 --> 00:14:19.637
Did I ever tell you
how she did it?


163
00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:21.472
[gasps]

164
00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:23.773
Is this truck
going to Chongqing?


165
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.975
I've been trying to
hitch a ride for two days.


166
00:14:25.977 --> 00:14:28.510
You can run over me if you like.
I'm not leaving.


167
00:14:28.512 --> 00:14:29.847
I like the sound of that.

168
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:34.753
All right!

169
00:14:35.653 --> 00:14:37.289
It's all right. Easy now.

170

[sighs]

171
00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:43.361
Officer, could you please
do me a favor?


172
00:14:45.597 --> 00:14:51.336
Deliver these two English pigs to Director Liu
of the National Livestock Research Center.


173
00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:53.337
Professor Chun's my name.

174
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.575
I did my job.

175
00:15:07.552 --> 00:15:09.454
[pigs grunting]

176
00:15:09.987 --> 00:15:10.888
What do you do?

177
00:15:16.294 --> 00:15:17.994
[Gangtou] So you're
an expert in livestock?


178
00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:19.795
[Chun] Not really.

179
00:15:19.797 --> 00:15:22.301
The research I've done
focuses on selective breeding.


180
00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:24.633
I brought these two piglets
back from England.


181
00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:27.903
They have a high meat-to-fat
ratio, about 55% or so.


182
00:15:27.905 --> 00:15:29.604
If the experiment
works as planned...


183
00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:31.742
But right now,
human life matters the most.


184
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:33.475
Pigs are worthless.

185
00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:35.280
You deal in fighting wars,

186
00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:37.647
I deal in porcine research.

Officer, I'll repair your
truck in return for a ride.


192
00:16:18.622 --> 00:16:19.654
Piss off!

193
00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:21.292
Why don't you let him try?

194
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:23.859
We can't stay stuck here.
We'll definitely get bombed.

Get out. Come here.

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:46.674
Look down there. See where
you almost put us, huh?


207
00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:47.578
Officer...

208
00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:50.779
Sir, I'm a mechanic
and a good driver.


209
00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:53.018
You have my word,
this will never happen again.


210
00:18:04.628 --> 00:18:05.629
Attention.

211
00:18:06.897 --> 00:18:08.596
I'm taking away
your flying privileges.


212
00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:10.533
You have to let me know
what I did wrong.


213
00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:12.437
- You really don't know?
- No, I don't.


214
00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.475
- [Jack] <i>What was your altitude?</i>
- <i>Forty-five hundred.</i>

[grunts]

220
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.150
So you do know the difference.

221
00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:28.787
You still wanna ask me
what you did wrong?


222
00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:32.523
You crying about
your dead brother?


223

Your brother you got killed?

224
00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:40.030
Is it just that I'm treating you too
harshly, or are you just feeling shitty?


225
00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:42.534
I'm feeling shitty.

226
00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:44.568
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

227
00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:46.737
- I'm feeling shitty!
- Good!

That's what I want! Now get
the fuck out of here now!

I'm sorry.

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:56.414

What's going on?

238
00:19:52.703 --> 00:19:54.472
There's a pretty young girl
walking down the road.


239
00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:56.838
Stop gawking. Drive on.

240
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.975
Where are you going, my friends?

241
00:19:58.276 --> 00:19:59.578
Chongqing.

242
00:19:59.976 --> 00:20:01.512
We could take them
with us, right?


243
00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:04.216
I call the shots here.

244
00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:07.982
I'll pay their fare.

245

It's not about
the money, Professor.


246

Be quiet. You don't have
a say here.


247
00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:13.055
Give me one good reason
not to take them.


248
00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:14.726
- Why would I?
- Because.


249
00:20:19.896 --> 00:20:21.899
Did you join the army
just to look tough, Officer?


250
00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:25.002
Protecting women and children
is a soldier's duty.


251
00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:27.137
You have to take these children
with you.


252
00:20:27.972 --> 00:20:29.604
Why is that?

253
00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:31.510
Because their dads are soldiers
like you.

Impressive. And look at
all these people. [chuckles]

How many have signed up, huh?

Ah, Uncle Cui. Hi.

259

Are you signing up, too, Cui?

Oh, come on now.
His gambling days are over.

We mustn't encourage him
to start playing again.


262

I'm here to sign up for my son.

263

When he comes
and competes with you,


264
00:20:56.968 --> 00:21:00.705
this tea house right here may well
return to its rightful owners.


265
00:21:01.172 --> 00:21:02.173
I'll be ready for him.

Uh... I worked at Union Bank
in Jiangxi, then the Japs came.

00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:16.855
What's in the bag?

271
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:18.890
Is it money?

272
00:21:19.123 --> 00:21:21.092
I wish. No, documents.

273
00:21:21.725 --> 00:21:23.127
I have to keep them right here.

274
00:21:24.328 --> 00:21:26.629
What for?

275
00:21:26.631 --> 00:21:29.801
It's sensitive customer information.
Numbers, statements. That kinda stuff.


276
00:21:30.768 --> 00:21:32.034
Has to be private.

277
00:21:32.036 --> 00:21:32.938
Why is that?

278
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:35.307

- Get in the truck, now!
- Oh, no, my pigs.

I'm right here! Fascist clowns!
Come on!

Got it. Got your pig.

to my father for the contest.

Step back.

Here, give the hose to me.
I got it.

All right. Someone help them put
this fire out. Faster, faster.

[Gangtou] I'm not really
with the army.

Ah...

315
00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:17.469
I'm with the air force.

316
00:24:18.202 --> 00:24:20.739
I love the air force.
So dignified.

[scoffs] What nonsense.

318
00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:26.778
We go up there to die.
I'm not afraid of the Japs,


319
00:24:27.144 --> 00:24:29.079
but their planes are more
advanced.


320
00:24:29.547 --> 00:24:31.482
It's a bloodbath up there.

321

Try to get in there first
or they'll shoot you down.

Thank you, hero.

I'm not a hero.
Not as long as I'm alive.

In the last few battles,
everyone in our squadron died.

Except for me.

326

Get away from here.

00:25:08.018 --> 00:25:11.990
Stay away. It's a bomb from a
Japanese plane. Didn't blow.


331
00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:17.428
I can try and disable it.

332
00:25:17.862 --> 00:25:20.231
- Please don't risk it if you're not certain.
- What else can we do?


333
00:25:21.565 --> 00:25:23.464
The road's narrow.
Truck won't fit.

it if you're not sure.

Why are you here?

We ask for your permission
to join the battle, sir.


340
00:26:27.964 --> 00:26:29.397
No way.

341
00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:31.435
The Japanese airplanes
are humiliating us.


342
00:26:32.135 --> 00:26:34.271
How can you sit here
and play mahjong?


343
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:36.506
Mahjong is no kids' stuff.

344
00:26:37.141 --> 00:26:39.074
It's mimic warfare.

345
00:26:39.076 --> 00:26:41.309
Could be helpful with your critical
thinking, especially yours.


346
00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:46.213
Sir, people in the city and even the whole
country are calling us helpless cowards.


347
00:26:46.215 --> 00:26:47.651
We cannot bear this anymore.

348
00:26:48.218 --> 00:26:50.551
Please give us permission
to fight.


349
00:26:50.553 --> 00:26:54.588
A truly brave person does not demonstrate his
bravery by hastening his death for nothing.


350
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.362
And if he has to die,
he has to die a martyr's death.


351
00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:01.329
But your air force is not
well-trained or equipped at all.


352
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:04.268
Even then, it's better than
sitting here playing mahjong.

00:27:08.172 --> 00:27:11.174
Ha! Yes! Big three
dragons, red dragon.


354
00:27:12.976 --> 00:27:15.679
That was quite a trick back there.
If you were Japanese,

like me, but that's okay.

we do have a common interest.

And what's that?

360
00:27:28.392 --> 00:27:29.327
The truck.

361

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.754
[all shouting] Never!
Never! Never! Never!


487
00:40:11.955 --> 00:40:14.091
[in Japanese]

488
00:40:20.296 --> 00:40:22.332
[screaming]

489
00:40:28.972 --> 00:40:31.307
[screaming]

490
00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:42.418
Coming through. Make way.
Let us through.


491
00:40:43.218 --> 00:40:44.287
Hurry up, hurry up.

492
00:40:45.455 --> 00:40:46.790
Help me, help me.

493
00:40:51.327 --> 00:40:54.897
I can't stop the bleeding.
We tried different compresses.


494
00:40:56.098 --> 00:40:58.566
He's hemorrhaging badly. He's
stopped breathing. Hurry, please.


495
00:40:58.568 --> 00:40:59.937
Julia?

496
00:41:01.037 --> 00:41:03.473
I thought you got on the boat.
Why are you still here?


497
00:41:03.872 --> 00:41:05.372
The boat was hit
before it even docked.


498
00:41:05.374 --> 00:41:07.408
I came back with a team
transporting the wounded.


499
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.379
You are the expert
brought here by our government.


500
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.383
Since you're still here,
we could really use your help.


501
00:41:17.153 --> 00:41:19.022
The boat sails to England
twice a month.


502
00:41:19.321 --> 00:41:21.959
So you'll have my international
assistance for the next two weeks.


503
00:41:22.225 --> 00:41:24.024
Thanks a lot.
Let's get to work.


504
00:41:24.026 --> 00:41:24.959
Hmm.

505
00:41:24.961 --> 00:41:26.296
[indistinct chatter]

506
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.838
Hey.

507
00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:41.310
You want some water?
Some water? Something?


508
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:44.314
[man] The last boat out of here
leaves tomorrow, Steve.


509
00:41:45.147 --> 00:41:46.214
I want you on it.

510
00:41:46.216 --> 00:41:47.948
I can't leave these people.

511
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.319
After this,
I can't guarantee safe passage.


512
00:41:54.323 --> 00:41:55.892
Someone told me something.

513
00:41:56.892 --> 00:41:57.961
Stuck with me.

514
00:42:00.263 --> 00:42:02.933
If you're not willing to fight
for what you love...


515
00:42:05.468 --> 00:42:07.538
then you never deserved it
in the first place.


516
00:42:14.577 --> 00:42:16.078
May God be with you.

517
00:42:18.414 --> 00:42:19.582
Take care, Steve.

518
00:42:23.285 --> 00:42:24.886
[indistinct chatter]

519
00:42:24.888 --> 00:42:26.287
Excuse me, I'm looking
for an Uncle Cui.


520
00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:28.321
Yeah. That's me. [laughs]

521
00:42:28.323 --> 00:42:32.261
Gangtou gave me, um,
a couple of things to give you.


522
00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:34.097
There's a letter, and this.

523
00:42:34.296 --> 00:42:35.198
- Here you are.
- Oh.


524
00:42:36.432 --> 00:42:38.466
Gangtou? Where is he?

525
00:42:38.468 --> 00:42:40.437
On the north side. The bridges are down.
He's stuck there.


526
00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:42.970
Can you get her
a cup of tea?


527
00:42:42.972 --> 00:42:44.540
Not for me. I must get going.
But thank you.


528
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:49.378
Thank you. Thank you. [laughs]

529
00:42:50.613 --> 00:42:53.046
Young Gangtou
is such a good boy.


530
00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:54.681
It's so nice of him
to think of me.


531
00:42:54.683 --> 00:42:56.350
- Yeah.
- Would you tell me what it says, please?


532
00:42:56.352 --> 00:42:57.421
Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:42:59.689 --> 00:43:00.591
Uncle...

534
00:43:01.323 --> 00:43:02.325
Something wrong?

535
00:43:04.327 --> 00:43:05.595
Your boy is gone.

536
00:43:28.984 --> 00:43:32.021
Lucky, I have
nothing to live for now.


537
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:35.491
I'm too sad to take care of you.

538
00:43:36.392 --> 00:43:37.327
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:39.062 --> 00:43:40.230
You deserve better.

540
00:43:41.531 --> 00:43:42.466
Go now.

541
00:43:44.566 --> 00:43:46.535
Find someone
with a reason to live.


542
00:43:56.678 --> 00:43:58.381
[crying]

543
00:44:11.593 --> 00:44:13.195
[laughs] Here you go.

544
00:44:13.595 --> 00:44:14.329
Thanks.

545
00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:16.997
I taught him
everything he knows.


546
00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:18.631
But I got to ask you,

547
00:44:18.633 --> 00:44:22.169
what's a beautiful girl like you
doing with this guy? [laughs]


548
00:44:22.171 --> 00:44:23.738
[all laughing]

549
00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.672
Hey, Minxun, my good friend,

550
00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:28.375
you don't mind if I show your
pretty lady friend around the base?


551
00:44:28.377 --> 00:44:30.210
- [chattering]
- Yeah, he's good.


552
00:44:30.212 --> 00:44:31.412
That's good.

553
00:44:31.414 --> 00:44:32.613
Hey, come on...

554
00:44:32.615 --> 00:44:33.549
Sir!

555
00:44:34.683 --> 00:44:36.386
Sir.

556
00:44:38.086 --> 00:44:40.957
You aren't concerned about us exploiting
your first date with this beautiful woman?


557
00:44:41.256 --> 00:44:42.158
Uh...

558
00:44:42.392 --> 00:44:43.426
We're not dating.

559
00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.597
I order you to escort this
young woman around the base.


560
00:44:48.263 --> 00:44:49.265
That's an order.

561
00:44:50.499 --> 00:44:51.534
[laughing]

562
00:44:55.604 --> 00:44:58.407
[Susan] These photos are more full
of life than any I've ever taken.


563
00:45:04.446 --> 00:45:05.448
Mmm-mmm.

564
00:45:06.115 --> 00:45:06.984
[laughs]

565
00:45:10.452 --> 00:45:11.354
It's ready.

566
00:45:14.557 --> 00:45:15.459
Wow.

567
00:45:15.825 --> 00:45:17.027
Gorgeous.

568
00:46:06.575 --> 00:46:07.476
Here you are.

569
00:46:08.644 --> 00:46:09.645
For keepsake.

570
00:46:15.218 --> 00:46:17.053
You keep one for yourself.

571
00:46:20.189 --> 00:46:21.091
I'm leaving.

572
00:46:22.524 --> 00:46:23.559
Tomorrow morning.

573
00:46:26.361 --> 00:46:27.530
[sighs]

574
00:46:29.165 --> 00:46:30.834
[explosions]

575
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:40.776
Just make sure
you stay alive.


576
00:46:42.477 --> 00:46:43.646
Yeah, you, too.

577
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.183
I forbid you to die.

578
00:47:00.897 --> 00:47:02.365
Be careful with my piggies!

579
00:47:02.932 --> 00:47:05.198
Look here. I'll teach you.

580
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.234
From here to here
to the target,


581
00:47:08.236 --> 00:47:09.738
line up the dots
and you can't miss.


582
00:47:10.872 --> 00:47:12.508
- But be careful...
- [gunshot]


583
00:47:16.912 --> 00:47:18.615
What is going on?
Are you out of your mind?


584
00:47:18.915 --> 00:47:20.617
Why are you teaching them
about guns?


585
00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:23.884
You're worse than gunpowder.
Always exploding.


586
00:47:23.886 --> 00:47:25.689
Well, if that's the case,
you shouldn't provoke me.


587
00:47:26.555 --> 00:47:27.590
You're just a big bully.

588
00:47:28.758 --> 00:47:29.658
Let's go.

589
00:47:33.562 --> 00:47:34.597
What do you think of her?

590
00:47:35.363 --> 00:47:36.332
Flawless.

591
00:47:36.531 --> 00:47:37.501
Perfect.

592
00:47:44.307 --> 00:47:45.207
Easy.

593
00:47:47.475 --> 00:47:49.410
From the first time
I've seen this fighter plane,


594
00:47:49.412 --> 00:47:50.814
I've never been afraid to die.

595
00:47:51.714 --> 00:47:53.850
I'll always find
the right reason to fight.


596
00:47:56.252 --> 00:47:57.354
What do you mean, sir?

597
00:47:57.653 --> 00:47:59.789
You and An Minxun
have that experience.


598
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.393
But only one person
could pilot the P-40.


599
00:48:20.343 --> 00:48:22.345
There's only one man
who can fly the P-40.


600
00:48:23.479 --> 00:48:24.548
That's me!

601
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.859
Hey! Minxun!

602
00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.827
You come back here right now!

603
00:48:42.298 --> 00:48:43.265
Are you deaf?

604
00:48:43.765 --> 00:48:44.667
Get off.

605
00:48:45.033 --> 00:48:46.602
[grunting]

606
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.841
That P-40 is mine!
You get that?


607
00:49:07.522 --> 00:49:08.424
Get up!

608
00:49:30.912 --> 00:49:32.248
[grunting]

00:49:40.656 --> 00:49:41.658
Argh!

610
00:49:55.537 --> 00:49:58.407
Give me the P-40,
please.


611
00:49:59.808 --> 00:50:01.410
Please let me seek revenge.

612
00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:05.481
Take the damn P-40.

613
00:50:06.948 --> 00:50:08.851
But you're not the only one
seeking revenge.


614
00:50:23.131 --> 00:50:25.968
The winner of today's contest
will donate his winnings


615
00:50:26.502 --> 00:50:28.337
to help our forces
fight the Japs.


616
00:50:28.604 --> 00:50:31.105
So, with pleasure,
I hereby start the contest.

[cheering]

618
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.810
Our Uncle Cui's son
died for our country.


619
00:50:36.812 --> 00:50:40.113
So we're pleased to announce
Cui will play instead!

Sit down. Yeah. Come on.

There. Take a seat. That's it.

[indistinct chatter]

Make it strong.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.031
Put in lots of nails.

626
00:50:57.033 --> 00:50:59.002
- How's it going?
- Take the kids across, okay?


627
00:51:00.136 --> 00:51:01.067
Be careful.

628
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:02.569
Oh, okay. Sure.

629
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:03.540
Come on.

630
00:51:43.711 --> 00:51:44.813
It's an air raid!

631
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.950
Come on! Run!

632
00:51:49.118 --> 00:51:50.116
Drive across.

[Gangtou] Get them in the truck.
Get all the kids in the truck.

It's an honor to be here
with you men tonight.


641
00:52:53.515 --> 00:52:54.983
I appreciate this little party.

This may be my last birthday.

643

Just a moment, sir.

please keep our presents.

to stay on the ground

I know what this gift represents
and what it means,

happened to him, he should...

979
01:26:19.952 --> 01:26:20.951
You called?

980
01:26:20.953 --> 01:26:22.921
I'm very proud to announce

981
01:26:22.923 --> 01:26:25.557
that this year's Mahjong
Champion is Uncle Cui!


982
01:26:25.559 --> 01:26:27.929
[cheering]

983
01:26:28.161 --> 01:26:29.597
Thanks to...

984
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:31.162
one tile.

985
01:26:31.164 --> 01:26:32.230
[Yaogu] Uncle Cui?

986
01:26:32.232 --> 01:26:34.298
It's time to take back the keys.

987
01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.299
What are you doing?

988
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:37.103
Uh, wait a minute, Yaogu.

989
01:26:37.571 --> 01:26:38.673
I appreciate your gesture,

990
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.475
but the rules of the game
were already established.


991
01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:42.977
Yeah.

992
01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:45.580
Remember? This money's
going to the air force.


993
01:26:46.045 --> 01:26:47.180
You can keep the tea house.

994
01:26:48.247 --> 01:26:50.248
But I'm keeping this one tile
as a souvenir.


995
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:52.683
Don't say that.
I've just announced it.


996
01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:54.953
You're trying to make me lose face.
These are yours.


997
01:26:54.955 --> 01:26:57.091
Look, let's get this straight.

998
01:26:57.624 --> 01:27:00.094
I'm just enjoying
being an honest winner.


999
01:27:00.326 --> 01:27:03.093
She handed the victory to you
on a plate.


1000
01:27:03.095 --> 01:27:04.296
Not quite.

1001
01:27:04.298 --> 01:27:06.131
- [shushing]
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.


1002
01:27:06.133 --> 01:27:08.669
I got it. We each take half
of the tea house.


1003
01:27:08.935 --> 01:27:11.072
And Manguan and I
will run it for you.


1004
01:27:12.339 --> 01:27:13.808
- Well?
- Well?


1005
01:27:14.241 --> 01:27:15.276
What was that?

1006
01:27:17.577 --> 01:27:18.278
What are you saying?

1007
01:27:19.313 --> 01:27:20.515
I get half the profits...

1008
01:27:22.014 --> 01:27:23.981
as co-owner, and yet
you two will do all the work?


1009
01:27:23.983 --> 01:27:25.553
- Right.
- Right.


1010
01:27:28.755 --> 01:27:30.291
I really like the sound of that.

1011
01:27:32.893 --> 01:27:34.060
Manguan.

1012
01:27:34.661 --> 01:27:36.127
You're like my new son.

1013
01:27:36.129 --> 01:27:38.062
[all laugh]

1014
01:27:38.064 --> 01:27:39.866
Thank you. Thank you.

1015
01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.635
Thank you.

1016
01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:44.071
Yes.

1017
01:27:51.812 --> 01:27:52.747
[Susan] <i>Minxun,</i>

1018
01:27:53.848 --> 01:27:56.283
<i>I hate to leave you,
but I'm heading to the front.</i>


1019
01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:00.185
<i>These pictures,
steeped in blood and tears,</i>


1020
01:28:00.187 --> 01:28:03.657
<i>are witnesses to the tragedy
and strength of our people.</i>


1021
01:28:04.625 --> 01:28:07.627
<i>You're like a sword in the
dark, my darling Minxun.</i>


1022
01:28:09.362 --> 01:28:11.865
<i>Your tight embrace
made me lose my fear of death.</i>


1023
01:28:13.233 --> 01:28:14.635
<i>The pictures are for you.</i>

1024
01:28:15.736 --> 01:28:18.104
<i>I hope they will remind
you of me and my camera.</i>


1025
01:28:20.006 --> 01:28:22.076
<i>The Chinese culture
will live on.</i>


1026
01:28:23.042 --> 01:28:26.947
<i>For the freedom and security of
our children and their children,</i>


1027
01:28:27.747 --> 01:28:31.952
<i>we must defend this sacred
land with our lives.</i>


1028
01:28:33.006 --> 01:28:38.006
