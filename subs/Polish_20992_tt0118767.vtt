3
00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:49.648
Spongers.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.664
You fracture his guard's arm and hardly
knock out his eye.


12
00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:50.625
You would not be sober, l would put you
into prison.


13
00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:53.628
Go!

14
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.633

15
00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:32.626

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:27.639
Was killed in the prison in January
of 1982.


23
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.643
My class-mate.

24
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:43.655
Do you have compact-disk of Nautilus
''Wings''.


25
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.663
What do you want? Get out! But l call
the police.


26
00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:08.639
Would better chop wood than place
your face.


27
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.641
Better would stay in the Army.

28
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:12.643
Here, fool, you will be killed sooner.

29
00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:15.646
You still switch on your piece
of ironmongery!


30
00:05:17.648 --> 00:05:21.652
Will die in the prison as your
good-for-nothing father.


31
00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:30.661
The only hope l have 
- My Vitenka.

32
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:35.666
Probably an important person there
ln Leningrad.


33
00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:48.637
Look at that, evereybody small

34
00:05:48.637 --> 00:05:50.639

But look once more!

37
00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:01.650
Well, would go to your brother
in Leningrad.


38
00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:07.656
Will die soon, but he was for instead
of your father


39
00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:09.658
lt's your blood.

40
00:06:09.658 --> 00:06:13.662
He is the most relative man
all over the world.


41
00:06:14.663 --> 00:06:16.623
Vitenka mine!

42
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.634
''BROTHER''

43
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:32.639
Who hadn't been in Moscow
hadn't seen beauty.


44
00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:39.646
Chechen was dismissed.
lt's necessary to kill him.


45
00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:43.650
Takes all market.
Listen, speaks:


46
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.652
Everything was mine in the past
''Takes from our places''.


47
00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:48.655
At the meeting of bandits we
have come to the agreement.


48
00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:50.657
Ours don't want the war

49
00:06:50.657 --> 00:06:53.660
but he is Paramon's relative.

50
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.663
But Chechen is here!

51
00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:01.626
ln shot - 15.

52
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.632
You know me, my prices are real.

53
00:07:08.634 --> 00:07:10.636
Fifteen?

54
00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:16.642
Money, of course, good
but for Chechen...


55
00:07:17.643 --> 00:07:20.646
Here l steak my neck out.

Have taken a lot in advance.

61
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.644
Stay at the market, don't catch
his eye.


62
00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:06.650
Take burden for you, for not fall when
you are running.


63
00:09:45.666 --> 00:09:47.626
Miss, do you have ''

64
00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:49.628

But come again must be delivered more.

And something another do you have?

Here you are ''Titanic over Fontanka''

How much is this?

71
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.653
This - 75800, and this - 78000.

72
00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:15.630
OK, bruises, trade?

Do you have watch?

74
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:21.637
Well, now everyone gives 50 now!

75

City? City is the terrible force.

84
00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.641
And than city is bigger,
the force is stronger.


85
00:12:07.641 --> 00:12:13.647
lt carries away. Only a strong man

He knows that we are weak now,
and he suppresses.


162
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:09.641
He has bought everybody there,

May be you need my help?

206

Go, go! l will find you.

207

lt wasn't Tatarin, and young man.

208
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:46.630
Did everything professionally.

209
00:32:46.672 --> 00:32:49.633
Chechen is dead and he ran away.

210
00:32:49.633 --> 00:32:53.637
Took yellow tram and went.

211

l shooted this skunk.

212
00:32:55.639 --> 00:32:57.641
He killed Shisha.

213

He was taken at hospital.


215

But why did you shoot,
if it's not Tatarin?


216
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.652
But l...

217
00:33:08.652 --> 00:33:11.655
We have to pay money to Tatarin
all the same.


218
00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:13.657
Stupid!

219
00:33:21.665 --> 00:33:23.625
And that he killed Shisha is very good.

220
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.628
We will remain above suspicion.

221
00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:29.631
Well Tatarin! ...

222
00:33:30.632 --> 00:33:34.636
His life is hang by a thread,
but he thinks about profit!


223
00:33:42.644 --> 00:33:45.647
You have to be taken to hospital.

224
00:33:45.647 --> 00:33:48.650
l can't go to hospital, German.

225
00:33:52.654 --> 00:33:58.660
Ok, German, we will break through.

226
00:34:11.632 --> 00:34:15.636

236
00:35:09.648 --> 00:35:13.652
Tell me, what do we live for?

237
00:35:13.652 --> 00:35:16.655
O, this is decision of everyone.

238
00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:20.659
This is a proverb:

239
00:35:20.659 --> 00:35:23.662
''That is good for Russian -
it's death for German.

Do you have a girl-friend?

242
00:35:38.635 --> 00:35:40.637
What about Zinka?

243
00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:45.642
Probably was beaten from her?

244
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:54.651
All right.

245
00:35:57.654 --> 00:36:00.657

lt's not in Christian.

512
01:12:33.642 --> 01:12:35.644

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.654
...but he has found me himself.

517

At first Shisha, then two have

534
01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:59.640
And now Mole has been killed.

l called you Daddy. What you?

559
01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:15.641
And remember, l have pierced my

560
01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:18.644
You carried me to home

There is a place there.

578
01:23:51.653 --> 01:23:53.655
Don't take the train.

579
01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:57.659
Go away from city
on the passing cars.

You spoke: city - force, and here
everybody are feeble.


617
01:28:11.663 --> 01:28:16.626
City - malicious force. Strong comes,
becomes feeble.


618
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:19.629
The city takes force.

619
01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:25.636
And it's have happened to you.

620

What do you? Take! A lot of
money here. Live.


622
01:28:43.654 --> 01:28:46.657
That is good for Russian - is the
death for German.


623
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.643
Well, German, good-by.

624

What are you going to do?

630
01:30:30.636 --> 01:30:32.638
May be to ''Piramida'',

631
01:30:32.638 --> 01:30:35.641
...may be ''Planetariy'',
but it's expensive there.


632
01:30:35.641 --> 01:30:37.643
Penkin sings today.

633
01:30:38.644 --> 01:30:40.646
