at all costs.

Is there any chance there are
packages with the wreckage?

- [Commando] Negative, we've
searched the crash site.

00:18:36.237 --> 00:18:38.440
It has to be with the pilot.

to the moosh there?

288
00:21:09.225 --> 00:21:12.228
But, uh, that
reminds me of a joke


289
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.329
the old man told me
when I was a kid.


290
00:21:15.598 --> 00:21:17.298
Guy gets in the subway train.

291

and the other guy's
got a black eye.


294
00:21:23.606 --> 00:21:25.440
And he says to him,
uh, "Hey, buddy,


295
00:21:25.473 --> 00:21:27.610
how'd you get your black eye?"

296
00:21:27.643 --> 00:21:31.479
And he goes, uh, "Uh, I was
looking to go on vacation.


297
00:21:31.514 --> 00:21:33.516
So, I went into a travel agency,

298
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:36.652
and, uh, here's
this hottie blonde


299
00:21:36.685 --> 00:21:39.320
with a big rack and
a tight sweater.


300
00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:41.557
I wanna ask her for two
tickets to Pittsburgh.


301
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.795
And I ended up asking her for
two pickets to Tittsburgh."

(Murph laughing)

303

Uh, he looks at at
him, and he goes,


304
00:21:49.265 --> 00:21:50.866
"How'd you get your black eye?"

305
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.936
"I came down to sit at
the breakfast table,


306
00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:56.404
and the wife asked me
what I'd like to have,


307
00:21:56.437 --> 00:22:00.276
and what I wanted to say was,
'A bowl of Post Toasties,'


308
00:22:00.308 --> 00:22:01.677
but what I ended up saying was,

'You fucking whore,
you've ruined my life.'"

00:22:09.218 --> 00:22:10.318
- That's a good one.

313
00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:12.154
That is a good one, Murph.

314
00:22:12.188 --> 00:22:13.689
The last time you told it to me,

315
00:22:13.722 --> 00:22:16.457
the last time, they were
on a bus, but I think,


316
00:22:16.492 --> 00:22:20.696
I think the subway, subway
is much, much better.

(Murph laughing)

318

Way better.

319
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.666
- Oh, I know.

320
00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:25.366
Ah.

321
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.704
Hey, anyway, I heard what
happened at your house


322
00:22:28.737 --> 00:22:30.673
with that little asshole, Robby.

323
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:33.441
That wasn't right.

324
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.212
Let me tell you, that
little douchebag,


325
00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:37.713
I fucking taught him
everything he knows


326
00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:41.951
about service work, heating,
plumbing, all right?


327
00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:45.453
You want me to take him
out behind a plumbing shop


328
00:22:45.486 --> 00:22:47.189
and straighten his ass
out, I'll fucking do that.


329
00:22:47.223 --> 00:22:49.325
- No, look.

330
00:22:49.357 --> 00:22:50.425
Appreciate it, okay?

331
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:52.595
It's my life, my problem.

332
00:22:52.628 --> 00:22:54.330
I'll take care of it.

333
00:22:54.362 --> 00:22:55.998
- [Murph] Hey, you gimme
the word, I'll take him


334
00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:58.433
out back and get all
Jersey all over his shit.


335
00:22:58.968 --> 00:22:59.869
- It's all good.

336
00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:02.805
- We all right with that?

337
00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:06.242
I'm sorry about that.
(glasses clinking)


338
00:23:06.275 --> 00:23:10.880
♪ I got down on my knees,
and I prayed, but they won ♪


339
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.749
(glasses thudding)

340
00:23:13.782 --> 00:23:16.484
Anyway, I'm supposed
to pick up this guy


341
00:23:16.518 --> 00:23:18.954
coming in from Canada,
and God knows where he is.


342
00:23:18.988 --> 00:23:21.891
He's running a little late,
but anyway, I gotta go.


343
00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:23.424
We all right?

344
00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:25.094
All right, we'll
catch up with you.


345
00:23:25.127 --> 00:23:27.229
- All right, brother.
- [Murph] All right, later.


346

(soldiers yelling indistinctly)

358
00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:51.046
- Let me go.

359
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.581
Get away from me.

360
00:24:53.582 --> 00:24:54.450
Someone help me.

361
00:24:54.482 --> 00:24:56.251
Stop, no, stop.

362
00:24:56.285 --> 00:24:57.686
I mean it.

363
00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.587
(gun clanking)
(dramatic music continues)


364
00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.722
I mean it, stop.

365
00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:03.359
Stop.

366
00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:05.461
Hey, I mean it, stop.

(door clattering)

370
00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:16.605
- Thank you.

371
00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:19.475
(engine revving)

372
00:25:19.508 --> 00:25:23.078

(bell ringing)

379
00:25:48.804 --> 00:25:50.339
- Who'd you piss off?

380
00:25:50.372 --> 00:25:52.541
- You know, usual story.

381
00:25:52.574 --> 00:25:53.742
You know, came
down to breakfast,


382
00:25:53.776 --> 00:25:56.678
and wife asked me what I wanted.

383
00:25:56.712 --> 00:25:58.515
I wanted to tell her I'd
like a bowl of cereal,


384
00:25:58.547 --> 00:26:01.884
but instead, I said,
"You fucking whore.


385
00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:04.053
You ruined my life (laughs)."

386
00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:05.921
She, uh, she smacked me.

387
00:26:05.954 --> 00:26:07.823
- Well, good to see you
haven't changed much.


388
00:26:07.856 --> 00:26:10.392
- Yeah, how are the elk doing?

389
00:26:10.426 --> 00:26:11.393
- Oh, they're still up high.

390
00:26:11.427 --> 00:26:12.728
It's been pretty warm.

391
00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:13.829
Should be coming
down soon, though.


392
00:26:13.862 --> 00:26:15.464
- Hope my guy likes walking.

393
00:26:15.498 --> 00:26:17.132
- Client's not a guy.

394
00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:18.600
- What?

395
00:26:18.634 --> 00:26:20.135
(door squeaking)
(bells ringing)


396
00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:21.504
- [Bill] There she is.

397
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:22.704
(latch clicking)

398
00:26:22.738 --> 00:26:26.008
(footsteps plodding)

399
00:26:31.146 --> 00:26:32.047
- Hi.

400
00:26:34.917 --> 00:26:35.818
I'm Kate.

401
00:26:39.888 --> 00:26:40.789
- Jackson.

402
00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:45.961
(crickets chirping)

403
00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:48.730
(mellow music)

404
00:27:03.745 --> 00:27:05.614
- My father always wanted
to take me hunting,


405
00:27:05.647 --> 00:27:07.149
but he never did it.

406
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.719
When he passed, I felt it
would be a good way to connect.


407
00:27:10.752 --> 00:27:13.222
So, I made the jump
and moved to Montana.


408
00:27:14.723 --> 00:27:15.824
I don't even have
an apartment yet.


409
00:27:15.858 --> 00:27:17.594
I've been staying at that motel.

410
00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:20.563
(hooves clopping)

411
00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:21.663
(Kate laughs)

412
00:27:21.697 --> 00:27:23.065
I'm riding with his ashes.

413
00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:26.702
I'd like to spread them
when we get an elk.


414
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.239
It's funny the things we
regret when a loved one dies.


415
00:27:32.774 --> 00:27:35.177
It's hard to connect
when you've lost someone.


416
00:27:36.945 --> 00:27:38.847
- Hunting isn't about talking.

417
00:27:39.915 --> 00:27:41.618
- Thought we were just
riding to high camp.


418
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.887
- We are, and we're
gonna do it quietly.


419
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.089
Animals know when
they're being hunted,


420
00:27:48.525 --> 00:27:53.095
so pretty please
with sugar on top-


421
00:27:53.128 --> 00:27:54.196
- Shut the fuck up?

422
00:27:55.164 --> 00:27:58.800
(mellow music continues)

423
00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:07.042
(crickets chirping)

424
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:16.752
- That's your tent over there.

425
00:28:16.785 --> 00:28:18.153
Make yourself comfortable.

426
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.455
I'll get the horses settled in,

427
00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:21.890
and then I'll start on dinner.

428
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.927
Pull out your rain gear.

429
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.862
I'll put it in my
pack for tomorrow,


430
00:28:26.895 --> 00:28:28.797
cut down on your weight.

431
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.066
We're gonna be putting
down a lot of miles.


432
00:28:32.569 --> 00:28:35.470
(Jackson exhales)

433
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:36.872
Never gets old.

434
00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:40.742
(mellow music continues)

435
00:28:43.312 --> 00:28:45.682
(zipper whizzing)

436
00:28:45.714 --> 00:28:48.317
(tent rustling)

437
00:28:52.589 --> 00:28:55.157
(gentle music)

438
00:28:55.991 --> 00:28:57.859
- [Commando] This is alpha one.

439
00:28:57.893 --> 00:29:00.095
I'm on the northern ridge side.

440
00:29:00.128 --> 00:29:02.097
No indication of the pilot yet.

441
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:07.336
(static hissing)
(walkie-talkie beeps)


442
00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:12.774
- This is whiskey seven.

443
00:29:12.808 --> 00:29:14.510
I've got nothing to your six.

444
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:16.311
I'm moving to your position.

445
00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:19.682
(wind howling)

446
00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:21.383
- This is tango leader.

447
00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:23.819
We've got nothing in the
third or fourth quadrant.


448
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.223
(suspenseful music)

449
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:35.931
(wood thudding)
(fire crackling)


450
00:29:35.964 --> 00:29:39.134
- So, sun up tomorrow's it 7:56.

451
00:29:41.604 --> 00:29:44.106
Means the first
legal shot's 7:41.


452
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.976
We wanna be in
position 7:15 latest.


453
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.145
It's about hour
walk to get there,


454
00:29:51.614 --> 00:29:54.651
so breakfast 5:30.
(crickets chirping)


455
00:29:54.684 --> 00:29:56.018
(Jackson sniffs)

456
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:58.954
- I'd like to split up
to cover more ground.


457
00:30:00.122 --> 00:30:00.989
- No.

458
00:30:01.823 --> 00:30:02.891
- Why not?

459
00:30:02.924 --> 00:30:04.627
(fire crackling)

460
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:06.629
- Because this is a guided hunt.

461
00:30:06.663 --> 00:30:07.362
(Kate sighs)

462
00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:08.297
Can't split up.

463
00:30:09.931 --> 00:30:12.367
- But wouldn't we have a
better shot of getting an elk?


464
00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:15.571
- I'm not hunting.

465
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.338
I'm guiding.

466
00:30:17.674 --> 00:30:19.007
- What's the difference?

467
00:30:20.677 --> 00:30:22.978
- I'm here to keep you safe

468
00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:26.783
and, um, take care
of your needs.


469
00:30:26.815 --> 00:30:28.651
(fire crackling)

470
00:30:28.685 --> 00:30:30.118
- I like the sound of that.

471
00:30:31.688 --> 00:30:33.188
- There's grizzlies, okay?

472
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:35.991
You could cross into Canada.

473
00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:38.360
You could accidentally
shoot an illegal animal.


474
00:30:38.393 --> 00:30:39.629
(Jackson sniffs)

475
00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:40.429
- Are we that close to Canada?

476
00:30:41.897 --> 00:30:43.165
An illegal animal?

477
00:30:44.366 --> 00:30:45.267
- Yeah.

478
00:30:48.136 --> 00:30:49.838
You know the difference

479
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:51.406
between a brown-tined
bull and a spike bull?


480
00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:57.346
Or, how about what side of
the creek section 314 ends


481
00:30:59.014 --> 00:31:00.949
and 317 begins, making it
illegal to shoot a cow?


482
00:31:00.982 --> 00:31:05.220
Or, what are you gonna
do, shoot a bull,


483
00:31:05.253 --> 00:31:08.156
runs off into somebody's
private field, hmm?


484
00:31:12.027 --> 00:31:15.931
- A spike bull is an elk with
antlers that do not branch.


485
00:31:16.998 --> 00:31:19.502
You can't shoot a bull
east of Mill Creek.


486
00:31:19.535 --> 00:31:23.105
And if your cow end's up in
a private field this far out,


487
00:31:23.138 --> 00:31:24.940
you should be a better shot.

488
00:31:27.209 --> 00:31:31.179
Just 'cause I'm a girl doesn't
mean I don't know shit, 'kay?


489
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.984
If you have something
to say, say it.


490
00:31:40.155 --> 00:31:42.991
- Well, I look forward to
showing you an adventure.


491
00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:46.829
(cup clanking)

492
00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:47.896
- I bet you will.

493
00:31:47.929 --> 00:31:50.966
(Jackson sniffs)

494
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.969
- You know, just 'cause
you read a book about it


495
00:31:54.002 --> 00:31:58.741
or you know, watched a
hunting show doesn't mean


496
00:31:58.775 --> 00:31:59.975
anybody can do this.

497
00:32:02.944 --> 00:32:05.213
- That is why I hired you.

498
00:32:06.348 --> 00:32:07.850
(clothes rustling)

499
00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:11.119
(footsteps plodding)

500
00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:15.490
(dramatic music)

501
00:32:15.525 --> 00:32:18.895

505
00:32:46.054 --> 00:32:47.122
(Sarah laughing)

506
00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:48.123
- [Hailey] I put it right here.

507
00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:49.224
- It's pretty good.

508
00:32:49.257 --> 00:32:50.325
I like that.
(latch clicking)


509
00:32:50.358 --> 00:32:52.327
(door squeaking)

510
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.130
- Look, Hailey,
Daddy's got the ball.


511
00:32:55.163 --> 00:32:56.833
- Throw me the ball.

512
00:32:56.866 --> 00:32:57.733
Throw me the ball.
(Jackson laughs)


513
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.936
- Okay, ready?

514
00:32:59.968 --> 00:33:03.940
(engine humming)
(upbeat music)


515
00:33:03.972 --> 00:33:05.340
Here it comes.

516
00:33:05.373 --> 00:33:06.074
(ball thudding)

517
00:33:06.107 --> 00:33:07.375
Oh, yes.
- Yeah.


518
00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:08.511
- Nice job.

519
00:33:08.544 --> 00:33:09.812
- Again, again.

520
00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:10.947
(engine humming)

521
00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:14.182
♪ Just started something ♪

522
00:33:16.117 --> 00:33:18.119
(upbeat music)
(hand thudding)


523
00:33:18.153 --> 00:33:20.890
- All right, here
comes a deep pass.


524
00:33:20.923 --> 00:33:25.761
(upbeat music continues)
(hand thudding)


525

(ball thudding)

526
00:33:27.195 --> 00:33:28.764
No.

(brakes screeching)

00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:45.942
(elk squealing)

540
00:34:45.975 --> 00:34:47.577
Did you hear 'em?

541
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.377
They're right up there.

542
00:34:49.411 --> 00:34:53.248
We're gonna go, but
go really quietly.


543
00:34:55.216 --> 00:34:56.217

(Jackson sighs)

551
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.728
It's funny, we, we
know they're so close,


552
00:35:39.962 --> 00:35:41.030
but they can feel the pressure,

553
00:35:41.063 --> 00:35:43.365
and they just, just move on.

554
00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:46.201
- We should split up.

555
00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:49.705
- Not a chance.

556
00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.575
(dramatic music)

557
00:36:09.357 --> 00:36:13.294

(birds chirping)

559
00:36:30.478 --> 00:36:31.279
- Up.

560
00:36:31.312 --> 00:36:34.215
- Yeah, it's pretty big.

561
00:36:35.316 --> 00:36:36.819
You know, grizzly bears

562
00:36:36.852 --> 00:36:40.022
in this area actually
run towards gunshots.


563
00:36:40.056 --> 00:36:41.557
- Why?

564
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.560
- Because they've learned
it's usually a hunter's kill,


565
00:36:44.593 --> 00:36:46.762
trying to get a nice, easy
meal before hibernation.


566
00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:48.497
- Ah.

567
00:36:48.531 --> 00:36:49.965
- Come on.

568
00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:52.267
That thing doesn't wanna
have anything to do with us.


569
00:36:55.604 --> 00:37:00.810
(dramatic music)
(footsteps plodding)


570
00:37:34.242 --> 00:37:36.812
(wind howling)

571
00:37:41.083 --> 00:37:44.653

(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)


574
00:38:22.858 --> 00:38:23.826
Look at that.

575
00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:25.293
- [Kate] What is it?

576
00:38:25.326 --> 00:38:26.427
- It's a print.

577
00:38:27.229 --> 00:38:28.296
- Elk?

578
00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:30.499
- Yeah, looks pretty fresh.

579
00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:35.838
(dramatic music continues)

580
00:38:38.174 --> 00:38:38.908
Come on.

581
00:38:40.543 --> 00:38:44.847
(footsteps plodding)
(dramatic music continues)


582
00:38:46.314 --> 00:38:47.750
Might be something up there.

583
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:49.885
(Kate sighs)

584
00:38:49.919 --> 00:38:50.786
- I'm too tired.

585
00:38:53.454 --> 00:38:55.423
It's getting late.

586
00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:58.359
We've been at it for 10 hours.

587
00:38:59.995 --> 00:39:02.865
- Okay, I'm gonna go to
the top of the ridge.


588
00:39:04.332 --> 00:39:05.768
If there's a herd
of elk up there,


589
00:39:07.203 --> 00:39:08.469
at least we'll
know for tomorrow.


590
00:39:09.437 --> 00:39:12.675

(footsteps plodding)
(gun clanking)


615
00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:43.679
Kate.

616
00:43:44.813 --> 00:43:46.448
(dramatic music continues)

617
00:43:46.482 --> 00:43:48.050
Kate.

618
00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:51.153
(Jackson grunting)

619
00:43:51.186 --> 00:43:52.054
What happened?

620
00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:53.155
You okay?

621
00:43:53.188 --> 00:43:55.090
- I took a shot at a bull.

622
00:43:55.124 --> 00:43:56.593
- What?

623
00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:58.994
- A bull elk, I took
a shot, and I missed.


624
00:43:59.027 --> 00:44:01.196
Did you see anything up there?

625
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.097
- Me?

626
00:44:03.632 --> 00:44:08.470
Uh, yeah, I, I saw
a bull out, too.


627
00:44:08.505 --> 00:44:09.805
(dramatic music continues)

628
00:44:09.838 --> 00:44:11.974
- Guess we should
start here tomorrow.


629
00:44:13.642 --> 00:44:15.744
- Yeah, yeah.

630
00:44:15.777 --> 00:44:16.745
(metal clanging)

(Jackson exhales)

632
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.882
We still gotta
drop your dad off.


633
00:44:19.915 --> 00:44:20.816
- What?

634
00:44:21.783 --> 00:44:24.019
- The ashes in the urn.

635
00:44:24.052 --> 00:44:25.053
- Yeah.

636
00:44:25.087 --> 00:44:26.355
- Yeah.

637
00:44:26.388 --> 00:44:29.691
All right, let's, uh,
let's get back to camp.


638
00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:32.861
(dramatic music continues)

639
00:44:32.895 --> 00:44:36.499
- [Kate] So, what
got you into hunting?


640
00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:37.500
- Well, I dunno.

641
00:44:37.534 --> 00:44:39.168
I had the experience.

642
00:44:40.235 --> 00:44:43.939
(dramatic music continues)

643
00:44:46.808 --> 00:44:48.511

(fire crackling)
(crickets chirping)


645
00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:55.851
So, tell me, did you really
come out here to shoot an elk,


646
00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.054
spread your father's ashes,

647
00:45:00.923 --> 00:45:03.025
start a new life
in Big Sky Country?


648
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:08.030
- Daddy wasn't cut
out to be a dad.


649
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:12.635
(Kate sighs)

650
00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:16.772
I'd like to say he did
his best, but he didn't.


651
00:45:19.975 --> 00:45:25.180
I wanted to come up here
to truly put him to rest.


652
00:45:25.847 --> 00:45:27.849
(fire crackling)

653
00:45:27.883 --> 00:45:29.751
I, I hope we will tomorrow.

654

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.703
(Jackson exhales)

658
00:45:46.735 --> 00:45:47.836
(dramatic music)

659
00:45:47.869 --> 00:45:50.272
- Stop pushing me away, Jackson.

660
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.246
I won't let you do
this to me, to us.


661
00:45:58.914 --> 00:46:00.683
We can get through
this together.


662
00:46:00.717 --> 00:46:03.519
We can be there for each other.

663
00:46:03.553 --> 00:46:06.021
You just, you gotta let me in.

664
00:46:07.122 --> 00:46:08.991
- There's a part of
me that's missing,


665
00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:16.231
a part of me that never
came back and died.


666
00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:23.372
And every day, I, I wait
for it to come back.


667
00:46:26.441 --> 00:46:30.078
Then, every day, I'm
disappointed because there it is


668
00:46:30.912 --> 00:46:32.381
just waving at me,

669
00:46:34.383 --> 00:46:38.954
reminding me, taunting me.

670
00:46:43.859 --> 00:46:44.826
(Jackson sighs)

671
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.827
(hands thudding)

672
00:46:45.861 --> 00:46:46.763
- But what?

673
00:46:46.795 --> 00:46:49.331
(Jackson sighs)

674
00:46:49.364 --> 00:46:51.501
But what, Jackson?

675
00:46:51.534 --> 00:46:56.104
You say you wanna be here
with me, to be here now,


676
00:46:56.138 --> 00:46:58.206
so do it.

677
00:47:01.343 --> 00:47:02.878
I lost Haley, too.

678
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.480
(fire crackling)

679
00:47:05.515 --> 00:47:08.884
We can get through all of
this together, you and me.


680
00:47:08.917 --> 00:47:10.419
We can do this.

681
00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.955
You gotta trust me.

682
00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:20.162
We can make it through
all of this together.


683
00:47:21.664 --> 00:47:23.599
You need to trust me.

684

694
00:48:17.486 --> 00:48:20.956
(footsteps plodding)

695
00:48:22.491 --> 00:48:23.992
- Got colder last night.

696
00:48:26.763 --> 00:48:28.163
- Try some pants.

697
00:48:29.998 --> 00:48:31.801
- No, it's all right.

698
00:48:31.834 --> 00:48:33.435
It reminds me of boarding
school in Russia.


699
00:48:35.904 --> 00:48:38.206
- You went to boarding
school in Russia?


700
00:48:39.241 --> 00:48:40.108
- Da.

701
00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:43.378
I told you I'm
full of surprises.


702
00:48:44.146 --> 00:48:45.414
Can I get some coffee?

703
00:48:46.281 --> 00:48:48.785
- Yeah, you gotta grind it.

704
00:48:48.818 --> 00:48:49.985
(coffee thudding)

705
00:48:50.018 --> 00:48:52.354
- All right.

706
00:48:52.387 --> 00:48:55.390
(footsteps plodding)

707
00:48:55.424 --> 00:48:57.092

(bird squawking)

714
00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:19.014
- [Commando] All
right, no sudden moves.


715
00:49:19.047 --> 00:49:21.016
Everyone move in slowly.

716
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:26.188
(dramatic music continues)

717
00:49:27.557 --> 00:49:30.927

(gunshots blasting)

719
00:49:34.062 --> 00:49:35.898

(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)


721
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:39.100

target is engaged.

(gunshots blasting)

725
00:49:43.573 --> 00:49:44.473

(dramatic music continues)


727

(footsteps plodding)

730
00:49:57.319 --> 00:49:58.487
We gotta go.

731
00:49:58.521 --> 00:49:59.755
- My father's urn.

732
00:49:59.789 --> 00:50:00.455
- You'll end up in an urn.

733
00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:01.557
Come on.

734
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:03.225

00:50:21.744 --> 00:50:27.048
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)

(soldier grunting)

740
00:50:36.959 --> 00:50:38.326
- Take the shot.

741
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.495
Do it.

742
00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:40.997

(dramatic music continues)

749
00:50:56.646 --> 00:50:57.513
- Jackson.

750
00:50:59.649 --> 00:51:00.816
- Gun.

751
00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.984

Let's go.

756
00:51:15.196 --> 00:51:17.465
(equipment rustling)

757
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.067
Now.

758
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.937
(footsteps plodding)

759
00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.305
- Target's on foot,
one male, one female.


760
00:51:23.338 --> 00:51:25.340
Package presumed
to be with targets.


761
00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:27.175
Intercept and neutralize.

762
00:51:27.208 --> 00:51:28.176
- [Commando] Copy that, Dina.

763
00:51:28.209 --> 00:51:29.177
We're in pursuit.

764
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.047
(engines revving)

765
00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:32.213

00:51:32.247 --> 00:51:33.315
(footsteps plodding)

767
00:51:33.348 --> 00:51:34.517
- [Kate] What's happening?

768
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.618
- [Jackson] Go, go.

769
00:51:35.651 --> 00:51:36.619
- [Kate] What's going on?

770
00:51:36.652 --> 00:51:37.620
- [Jackson] Keep moving.

771
00:51:37.653 --> 00:51:38.888
- [Kate] Jackson, stop.

772
00:51:38.921 --> 00:51:39.622
- [Jackson] They're coming.

773
00:51:39.655 --> 00:51:40.890
- Jackson, stop.

774
00:51:40.923 --> 00:51:42.892
I need pants. I need pants.

775
00:51:42.925 --> 00:51:44.492
Jackson.
- Shit.


776
00:51:44.527 --> 00:51:45.393
(bag rustling)

777
00:51:45.427 --> 00:51:46.929
I got your rain pants in mine.

778
00:51:46.963 --> 00:51:48.263
(engines revving)

779
00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:49.464
- Who are those guys?

780
00:51:49.498 --> 00:51:50.165
(zipper whizzing)

781
00:51:50.198 --> 00:51:51.067
What's going on?

782
00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:52.068
- This is bad.

783
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.936
This is my fault.

784
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.037
(bag rustling)

785
00:51:55.071 --> 00:51:56.639
- Why are they shooting at us?

786
00:51:56.672 --> 00:51:58.975
(equipment clanking)

787
00:51:59.008 --> 00:52:01.309
- I found a case full
of money yesterday.


788
00:52:01.343 --> 00:52:02.511
(dramatic music continues)

789
00:52:02.545 --> 00:52:03.311
- [Kate] You what?

790
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.917
- Up in that deer stand
on top of the ridge line.


791
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:11.087
There was a dead
guy in a parachute.


792
00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:12.722
In his hand was
a submachine gun,


793
00:52:14.389 --> 00:52:18.561
and at his feet, there
was a case full of money.


794
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:20.062
- Yeah, right.

795
00:52:20.096 --> 00:52:21.097
(dramatic music continues)

(lid thudding)

802
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:44.219
- We gotta get outta here.

803
00:52:44.252 --> 00:52:45.621
(engines revving)

804
00:52:45.655 --> 00:52:46.689
I ruined your hunt.

805
00:52:46.722 --> 00:52:48.991
(bag rustling)

806
00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:50.358
- You ruined my hunt?

807
00:52:51.192 --> 00:52:53.261
You saved my life.

808
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.966
- I never should
have opened the case.


809
00:52:56.999 --> 00:53:00.002
They wouldn't have chased us.

810
00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:01.604
- Just get me outta here alive.

811
00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:05.206
We can split the money.

812
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.275
(engines revving)

813
00:53:07.308 --> 00:53:11.013
(dramatic music continues)

814
00:53:11.047 --> 00:53:13.716
- All right, that's a deal.

815
00:53:15.151 --> 00:53:17.687
(engines revving)

816
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.621
- What are we gonna do?

817
00:53:21.222 --> 00:53:22.323
- Kill 'em.

818
00:53:25.161 --> 00:53:28.731
(dramatic music continues)

819
00:53:30.733 --> 00:53:33.569
(phone ringing)

820
00:53:33.602 --> 00:53:35.071
- Go.

821
00:53:35.104 --> 00:53:37.205
- Targets were engaged
but able to escape.


822
00:53:37.238 --> 00:53:38.507
In pursuit now.

823
00:53:38.541 --> 00:53:40.176
Package presumed
to be with them.


824
00:53:40.208 --> 00:53:42.011
- What do you mean presumed?

825
00:53:42.044 --> 00:53:43.012
- It's with them.

826
00:53:43.045 --> 00:53:44.345
We'll get it.

827
00:53:44.379 --> 00:53:46.749
- Very good, send
me your coordinates.


828
00:53:46.782 --> 00:53:48.150
- I said we'll get it.

829
00:53:48.184 --> 00:53:49.250
It'll be had.

830
00:53:49.284 --> 00:53:50.586
- Send me your coordinates.

831
00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:51.787
I'm gonna get you
your money back.


832
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:56.092
(phone beeping)

833
00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:57.526
(engine humming)

834
00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.463
(dramatic music continues)

835
00:54:17.245 --> 00:54:19.280
(dramatic music continues)

836
00:54:19.314 --> 00:54:21.217
- There's no out
running dirt bikes.


837
00:54:21.249 --> 00:54:22.752
How good of a shot are you?

838
00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:24.019
- What do you mean?

839
00:54:24.053 --> 00:54:25.286
- I got a plan.

840
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.189
(strap rustling)

841
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:28.256
Come on.

842
00:54:28.289 --> 00:54:30.826
(footsteps plodding)

843
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.162
- I really hate your plan.

844
00:54:33.195 --> 00:54:36.098
- If they stop, I'll
give 'em the bag.


845
00:54:36.132 --> 00:54:38.567
If they don't, you shoot 'em.

846
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.436
- What if they just shoot you?

847
00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:44.106
- It's hard to get a clean
shot from a moving bike.


848
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.108
- What if they stop
and then shoot you?


849
00:54:46.142 --> 00:54:47.643
(engines revving)

850
00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:49.245
- Well, let's just hope I
can draw quicker than them.


851
00:54:49.277 --> 00:54:50.112
(dramatic music continues)

852
00:54:50.146 --> 00:54:52.047
(Kate exhales)

853
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:54.315
(footsteps plodding)

854
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:56.218
(engines revving)

855
00:54:56.252 --> 00:54:57.253
(water splashing)

856
00:54:57.285 --> 00:55:00.388
(engines revving)

857
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:06.896
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)


858
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.465
(engines humming)

859
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:20.276
(guns clanking)

860
00:55:20.308 --> 00:55:21.309
- Drop the bag.

861
00:55:21.342 --> 00:55:22.978
Hands in the air.

862
00:55:23.012 --> 00:55:27.550
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)


863
00:55:30.186 --> 00:55:31.520
- You're crazy (laughs).

864
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.860
(bag rustling)

865
00:55:39.662 --> 00:55:40.563
- Jackson.

866
00:55:43.833 --> 00:55:45.234
- Drop the gun.

867
00:55:45.267 --> 00:55:47.102
Drop the bag.

868
00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:48.137
Drop that gun.

869
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.437
I'll blow her head off.

870
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:51.307
- Okay, all right, just tell me

871
00:55:51.339 --> 00:55:52.508
what you want me to do first.

872
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:53.809
- You heard what I said.

873
00:55:53.843 --> 00:55:55.343
Just do it.

874
00:55:55.376 --> 00:55:56.745
- Okay, I'm really
bad at directions.


875
00:55:58.147 --> 00:55:59.548
- Just drop the-
- Look, you got


876
00:55:59.582 --> 00:56:01.016
a gun at my friend's head.

877
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:03.185
You just tell me what
you want me to do first.


878
00:56:03.219 --> 00:56:03.919
- Don't be stupid.

879
00:56:03.953 --> 00:56:04.820
You heard me.

880
00:56:06.255 --> 00:56:07.122
(bag rustling)
(gunshot blasting)


881
00:56:07.156 --> 00:56:07.857
(soldier grunts)

882
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:08.724
- Let's do mine.

883
00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:11.727
Let's do it my way.

884
00:56:14.196 --> 00:56:15.631
- You are crazy.

885
00:56:21.737 --> 00:56:23.505
- [Commando] Alpha one to Dina,

886
00:56:23.539 --> 00:56:26.041
target's engaged on North Road.

887
00:56:26.075 --> 00:56:28.644
Permission to engage.
(dramatic music continues)


888
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.847
- Excellent, kill them
and retrieve the package.


889
00:56:33.448 --> 00:56:37.853
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)


890
00:56:38.587 --> 00:56:41.489
(gunshots blasting)

891
00:56:47.496 --> 00:56:49.531
(gun clanking)

892
00:56:49.565 --> 00:56:53.736
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)


893
00:56:53.769 --> 00:56:56.404
(gun clanking)

894
00:56:56.437 --> 00:57:01.644
(dramatic music continues)
(gunshots blasting)


895
00:57:09.018 --> 00:57:10.986
(bird squawking)

896
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.424
(gunshots blasting)
(dramatic music continues)


897
00:57:20.529 --> 00:57:22.331
- Jackson, on your right.

898
00:57:22.364 --> 00:57:23.464
(gunshots blasting)

899
00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:24.500
(commando grunting)

900
00:57:24.533 --> 00:57:27.736
(gunshots blasting)

901
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:31.807
(footsteps plodding)

902
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.275
- You okay?

903
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:35.644
- I'm fine.
- Okay, let's go.


904
00:57:35.678 --> 00:57:36.912
- Who are you really?

905
00:57:38.714 --> 00:57:41.283
- On your feet, let's go.

906
00:57:41.317 --> 00:57:43.619
(footsteps plodding)

907
00:57:43.652 --> 00:57:48.824
(dramatic music)
(footsteps plodding)


908
00:57:54.697 --> 00:57:57.566
(equipment clanking)

909
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:59.268
Those aren't for this.

910
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:02.905
Listen, we need to get some
cover and get off this mountain.


911
00:58:04.373 --> 00:58:05.607
- Who are you really?

912
00:58:07.076 --> 00:58:09.712
- I'm just a hunting guide
trying to get you down safe.


913
00:58:10.846 --> 00:58:12.581
I think you should go
down alone, all right,


914
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:15.017
no pack, no money, no
reason to bother you.


915
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:17.386
It'll be safer.

916
00:58:17.419 --> 00:58:20.756
- Absolutely not, I'd
die on that trail.


917
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:21.690
- Yeah?

918
00:58:21.724 --> 00:58:23.491
Well, you may die up here.

919
00:58:23.525 --> 00:58:25.127
- I am not walking on foot

920
00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.463
through grizzly bear-infested
woods while a bunch


921
00:58:27.496 --> 00:58:30.866
of paramilitary guys with
machine guns shoot at me.


922
00:58:30.899 --> 00:58:32.468
I trusted you to
take me up here.


923
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:34.803
You need to get me out, too.

924
00:58:34.837 --> 00:58:35.704
Who are you?

925
00:58:38.107 --> 00:58:40.309
(gun clanking)

926
00:58:40.342 --> 00:58:43.645
- That is an MDRX
bullpup assault rifle,


927
00:58:43.679 --> 00:58:46.749
suppressed and chambered in 308,

928
00:58:46.782 --> 00:58:48.617
has a multidynamic firing system

929
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.086
between semi-automatic
and fully automatic modes.


930
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.188
It weighs 8.7 pounds.

931
00:58:53.222 --> 00:58:55.758
The firing mechanics are all
located behind the trigger.


932
00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:58.627
The purpose of this
design gives the MDRX


933
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.796
a shorter overall length
than a conventional rifle


934
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:02.431
of a similar barrel length.

935
00:59:02.464 --> 00:59:03.832
It comes in four main variants,

936
00:59:03.866 --> 00:59:07.669
223, 308, 6.5 Creedmoor,
and 300 Blackout.


937
00:59:07.703 --> 00:59:10.305
This, this is a
custom-made assault rifle


938
00:59:10.339 --> 00:59:12.741
chambered in a NATO 556 round.

939
00:59:12.775 --> 00:59:15.611
These guys, these guys are pros.

940
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.381
(Kate sighs)

941
00:59:19.415 --> 00:59:21.550
I was a Navy Seal
for most of my life.


942
00:59:21.583 --> 00:59:23.719
We stepped into
something really bad.


943
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.091
- So, military operatives
are trying to kill us?


944
00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:32.728
- They probably
just want the money.


945
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.533
- What if they don't
just want the money?


946
00:59:36.565 --> 00:59:37.666
What if they wanna kill you

947
00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:39.468
because you know
about the money?


948
00:59:39.502 --> 00:59:42.671
- We, we know about the money.

949
00:59:44.773 --> 00:59:46.475
So, what do you say?

950
00:59:46.509 --> 00:59:47.476
I'll get you on that trail.

951
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:48.511
You can go down alone.

952
00:59:48.545 --> 00:59:49.812
It'll be safer for you.

953
00:59:49.845 --> 00:59:51.880
- You're not hearing me.

954
00:59:51.914 --> 00:59:53.115
Trust me.

955
00:59:53.148 --> 00:59:54.049
I need you.

956
00:59:55.518 --> 00:59:56.618
Please.

957
00:59:57.453 --> 00:59:58.620
- I don't do that.

958
00:59:59.888 --> 01:00:00.789
- What?

959
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:02.791
- Trust.

960
01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:06.128
(Kate sighs)

961
01:00:07.763 --> 01:00:09.631
- If, if I'm going down the
mountain, it's with you.


962
01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:11.568
If I'm gonna die,
it's not gonna be


963
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.969
at the hands of some
gunman or a bear.


964
01:00:16.872 --> 01:00:18.774
I'm staying with you.

965
01:00:22.211 --> 01:00:23.078
- Okay.

966
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.647
I'm your guide.

967
01:00:25.681 --> 01:00:27.216
I'll get you out of this alive.

968
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.155
(dramatic music)
(footsteps plodding)


969
01:00:43.232 --> 01:00:44.133
Let's go.

970
01:00:45.568 --> 01:00:47.169
- This isn't the
way we came, is it?


971
01:00:48.137 --> 01:00:50.607
- Nope, it's a back way.

972
01:00:50.639 --> 01:00:52.674
I'm hoping not to
run into anyone.


973
01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:56.011
- Hate to burst your bubble.

974
01:00:57.514 --> 01:00:59.481
(dramatic music continues)

975
01:00:59.516 --> 01:01:01.717
- [Jackson] Go, go, go.

976
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:06.955
(footsteps plodding)
(dramatic music continues)


977
01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.861
(gun clanking)

978
01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:24.673
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)


979
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.274
- We're trapped.

980
01:01:27.843 --> 01:01:29.011
We should go back.

981
01:01:29.711 --> 01:01:31.113
- No, no.

982
01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.014
We can ascend it.

983
01:01:32.047 --> 01:01:33.148
- What?

984
01:01:33.182 --> 01:01:34.750
- I can climb it.

985
01:01:34.783 --> 01:01:36.385
- You're gonna rock-climb it

986
01:01:36.418 --> 01:01:38.720
with an automatic weapon
strapped to you and a backpack?


987
01:01:38.754 --> 01:01:40.889
- No, that would be ridiculous.

988
01:01:40.923 --> 01:01:42.691
- [Kate] Then what?

989
01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:44.493
- You're gonna have the pack.

990
01:01:44.527 --> 01:01:47.029
I'm gonna go up, and
I'll bring you up.


991
01:01:47.062 --> 01:01:48.964
(zipper whizzing)
If we can gain


992
01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.800
the knife-blade ridge, we can
get to the truck really fast,


993
01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.068
long as nobody falls.

994
01:01:53.936 --> 01:01:55.672
- And that sounds better?

995
01:01:55.704 --> 01:01:57.940
(gun clanking)
(dramatic music continues)


996
01:01:57.973 --> 01:02:00.475
- [Jackson] I don't like this.

997
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:01.243
- What is it?

998
01:02:03.779 --> 01:02:08.050
- If you can't see the
target, you become the target.


999
01:02:09.284 --> 01:02:11.588
(dramatic music continues)

1000
01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:12.788
We're being hunted.

1001
01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:19.728
(gun clanking)

1002
01:02:19.761 --> 01:02:20.729
We gotta get up this wall.

1003
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:25.000
(bags rustling)

1004
01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:32.007
(crickets chirping)
(footsteps plodding)


1005
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:43.318
(dramatic music)

1006
01:02:43.352 --> 01:02:44.319
'Kay.

1007
01:02:44.353 --> 01:02:46.088
(zipper whizzing)

1008
01:02:46.121 --> 01:02:47.657
When the rope goes tight,
it means you're on belay.


1009
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.324
- What does that mean?

1010
01:02:49.358 --> 01:02:51.960
- When the rope goes tight,
you start climbing up.


1011
01:02:52.828 --> 01:02:54.731
- And if I fall, I'm safe?

1012
01:02:54.763 --> 01:02:57.065
- I'm only giving
you a hip belay.


1013
01:02:57.099 --> 01:02:57.966
Don't fall.

1014
01:02:58.767 --> 01:03:01.903
(clothes rustling)

1015
01:03:03.706 --> 01:03:08.910
(feet thudding)
(Jackson grunting)


1016
01:03:14.283 --> 01:03:16.852
(Kate sighs)

1017
01:03:16.885 --> 01:03:18.820
(Jackson grunting)

1018
01:03:18.854 --> 01:03:22.224
(dramatic music continues)

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.193
(Jackson grunting)

1020
01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:32.769
(Kate sighs)

1021
01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:37.973
(dramatic music continues)
(Jackson grunting)


1022
01:03:43.912 --> 01:03:46.783
- Drop the pack and put
your hands in the air.


1023
01:03:49.151 --> 01:03:50.352
(Kate grunting)
(soldier grunting)


1024
01:03:50.385 --> 01:03:51.621
(elbow thudding)

1025
01:03:51.654 --> 01:03:52.755
(body thudding)

1026
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:54.189
(footsteps plodding)

1027
01:03:54.222 --> 01:03:56.358
(dramatic music continues)
(rope whizzing)


1028
01:03:56.391 --> 01:03:57.326
- Watch the rope.

1029
01:03:58.695 --> 01:04:00.228
(rope whizzing)

1030
01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:01.897
(feet thudding)

1031
01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:02.898
(rope whizzing)

1032
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:04.734
(soldier grunting)

1033
01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:06.902
(Kate grunting)
(body thudding)


1034

(rope whizzing)
(Kate grunting)


1035
01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:12.841
(dramatic music continues)

1036
01:04:12.874 --> 01:04:15.877
(Kate grunting)

1037
01:04:22.785 --> 01:04:24.286
(foot thudding)
(soldier grunting)


1038
01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.287
(knee thudding)

1039
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.390
(footsteps plodding)

1040
01:04:28.423 --> 01:04:29.759
(rope whizzing)
- Ow.


1041
01:04:29.792 --> 01:04:31.828
(gunshots blasting)

1042
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.995
(footsteps plodding)

1043
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:36.264
(gunshots blasting)

1044
01:04:36.298 --> 01:04:39.434
(water sloshing)

1045
01:04:39.468 --> 01:04:42.839
(gunshots blasting)

1046
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:45.974
(soldier grunting)
(gunshots blasting)


1047
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:46.975
(soldier grunting)
(body thudding)


1048
01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.712
(gunshots blasting)

1049
01:04:49.746 --> 01:04:52.715
(dramatic music continues)

1050
01:04:52.749 --> 01:04:54.149
- Jackson, pull me up.

1051
01:04:56.552 --> 01:05:01.957
(dramatic music continues)
(Kate breathing heavily)


1052
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:03.860
(grunting) Oh, shit.
- That's it.


1053
01:05:03.892 --> 01:05:04.993
Keep coming.

1054
01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.829
I've got you.
(Kate grunting)


1055
01:05:06.863 --> 01:05:07.830
Did you get hit?

1056
01:05:07.864 --> 01:05:08.964
- I think it grazed me.

1057
01:05:08.997 --> 01:05:10.098
- You're gonna sit down.

1058
01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:10.867
Hold on.

1059
01:05:10.899 --> 01:05:13.001
(Kate gasping)

1060
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.871
(footsteps plodding)

1061
01:05:14.903 --> 01:05:16.438
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?


1062
01:05:16.471 --> 01:05:17.439
- [Kate] I told you.

1063
01:05:17.472 --> 01:05:18.741
I'm full of surprises.

1064
01:05:18.775 --> 01:05:19.509
- Okay.

1065
01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:24.146
- My dad wanted a boy,

1066
01:05:24.179 --> 01:05:25.515
so he made me take
mixed martial arts.


1067
01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:28.150
(Kate sighs)

1068
01:05:28.183 --> 01:05:29.786
Look, I don't think you got
a direct hit on that guy.


1069
01:05:29.819 --> 01:05:30.952
- Yeah.

1070
01:05:30.986 --> 01:05:32.421
How's your leg?

1071
01:05:32.454 --> 01:05:33.922
- [Kate] It hurts.

1072
01:05:33.955 --> 01:05:35.991
- All right, let
me have the pack.


1073
01:05:36.024 --> 01:05:37.058
(both breathing heavily)

1074
01:05:37.092 --> 01:05:38.326
- You don't trust me?

1075
01:05:40.195 --> 01:05:42.164
- Look, I need to get
a look at the leg.


1076
01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:45.200
(clothes rustling)
(Jackson grunting)


1077
01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:46.134
- Here.

1078
01:05:47.804 --> 01:05:48.504
(zipper whizzing)

1079
01:05:48.538 --> 01:05:49.872
Here.

1080
01:05:49.906 --> 01:05:50.773
(zipper whizzing)

1081
01:05:50.807 --> 01:05:52.340
Try it this way.

1082
01:05:52.374 --> 01:05:54.209
(belt clanking)

1083
01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:58.180
(dramatic music continues)

1084
01:05:59.849 --> 01:06:01.784
How's it look?

1085
01:06:01.818 --> 01:06:05.420
(dramatic music continues)

1086
01:06:13.763 --> 01:06:16.331
(Kate moaning)

1087
01:06:25.842 --> 01:06:27.175
How's it look?

1088
01:06:32.047 --> 01:06:33.281
- It just grazed you.

1089
01:06:37.887 --> 01:06:39.120
Let me have the pack.

1090
01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:41.423
- The pack?

1091
01:06:43.325 --> 01:06:44.760
- Yeah.

1092
01:06:44.794 --> 01:06:46.496
There's a first aid
kit in the pack.


1093
01:06:48.865 --> 01:06:51.466
(bag rustling)

1094
01:06:55.203 --> 01:06:56.772
We gotta stash the case.

1095
01:06:56.806 --> 01:06:59.542
(zipper whizzing)

1096
01:07:01.209 --> 01:07:03.078
- You wanna hide a case
full of money in the woods


1097
01:07:03.111 --> 01:07:04.981
after everything
we've been through?


1098
01:07:05.013 --> 01:07:06.214
(Jackson breathing heavily)

1099
01:07:06.248 --> 01:07:07.950
- Look, you're hit.

1100
01:07:07.984 --> 01:07:10.553
This case, it's just
gonna slow us down.


1101
01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.322
We stand a much better
chance of surviving


1102
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:16.592
if it's not on us.

1103
01:07:16.626 --> 01:07:17.492
- I'm not hit.

1104
01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:19.829
It grazed me.

1105
01:07:19.862 --> 01:07:20.997
(hand thudding)

1106
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:22.130
(Jackson breathing heavily)

1107
01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.466
(bag rustling)

1108
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.067
(zipper whizzing)

1109
01:07:26.101 --> 01:07:27.537
(clothes rustling)

1110
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:28.470
- You trust me?

1111
01:07:30.038 --> 01:07:31.373
- I trust you.

1112
01:07:33.576 --> 01:07:35.043
- Good.

1113
01:07:35.076 --> 01:07:38.614
(bag rustling)
(zipper whizzing)


1114
01:07:38.648 --> 01:07:40.016
I know just the place.

1115
01:07:40.048 --> 01:07:42.484
(bag rustling)

1116
01:07:42.518 --> 01:07:43.385
Come on.

1117
01:07:44.152 --> 01:07:47.188
(dramatic music)

1118
01:07:54.462 --> 01:07:56.164
Watch your step.
(footsteps plodding)


1119
01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.133
- (sighs) What's your plan?

1120
01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:00.068
- We're gonna hide
the case in that tree.


1121
01:08:00.101 --> 01:08:01.169
- What?

1122
01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.304
- You'll see.

1123
01:08:03.739 --> 01:08:08.644
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps plodding)


1124
01:08:11.514 --> 01:08:12.515
Okay.

1125
01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:14.617
(zipper whizzing)

1126
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:15.551
Hold this.

1127
01:08:17.185 --> 01:08:18.286
Okay.
(gun clanking)


1128
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.689
I'm gonna go up the tree.

1129
01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:24.192
I'm gonna drop this
rope down to the bottom.


1130
01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.928
You're gonna tie it to the case.

1131
01:08:25.962 --> 01:08:28.163
I'm gonna pull it up, 'kay?

1132
01:08:28.196 --> 01:08:29.599
You watch.
- Really?


1133
01:08:29.632 --> 01:08:31.500
- Yeah, it's gonna work.

1134
01:08:31.534 --> 01:08:32.902
- All right.

1135
01:08:32.935 --> 01:08:34.537
(dramatic music continues)

1136
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:37.540
(Jackson grunting)

1137
01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:49.652
- Rope's coming down.

1138
01:08:51.286 --> 01:08:52.955
(dramatic music continues)

1139
01:08:52.989 --> 01:08:53.689
You got it?

1140
01:08:53.723 --> 01:08:54.957
- Yeah.

1141
01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:57.093
- Okay, tie it to the pack.

1142
01:08:57.125 --> 01:09:00.462
(briefcase clattering)

1143
01:09:01.998 --> 01:09:02.965
You good?

1144
01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:03.733
- Yeah.

1145
01:09:06.736 --> 01:09:08.236
(briefcase thudding)

1146
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.105
- [Jackson] All right,
I'm gonna pull it up.


1147
01:09:09.137 --> 01:09:10.106
- Okay.

1148
01:09:10.138 --> 01:09:13.075
(briefcase clattering)

1149
01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:16.679
(dramatic music continues)

1150
01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:18.080
- [Jackson] It worked.

1151
01:09:18.114 --> 01:09:19.214
- Genius.

1152
01:09:20.049 --> 01:09:23.619
(dramatic music continues)

1153
01:09:29.424 --> 01:09:31.192
Think we'll see that case again?

1154
01:09:31.226 --> 01:09:32.094
(bag rustling)

1155
01:09:32.128 --> 01:09:33.428
- I hope so.

1156
01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:35.397
All right, the sun's going down.

1157
01:09:36.431 --> 01:09:37.767
We're a couple
miles from my truck.


1158
01:09:39.101 --> 01:09:40.736
All right, let's go.

1159
01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:44.707
(footsteps plodding)

1160
01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.476
(dramatic music continues)

1161
01:09:56.052 --> 01:09:57.352
(Jackson breathing heavily)

1162
01:09:57.385 --> 01:09:59.287
- What are you doing?

1163
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.222
- I'm gonna throw the
pack in the river.


1164
01:10:01.256 --> 01:10:02.958
That way, if they find it,

1165
01:10:02.992 --> 01:10:05.260
it's far away from
us and the money.


1166
01:10:06.095 --> 01:10:07.328
(bag thudding)

1167
01:10:07.462 --> 01:10:08.229
You okay?

1168
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:09.464
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You cold?


1169
01:10:09.598 --> 01:10:10.298
- I'm fine.

1170
01:10:10.432 --> 01:10:11.567
- All right, we
gotta keep moving.


1171
01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:12.300
Let's go.

1172
01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:18.239
(dramatic music continues)

1173
01:10:21.811 --> 01:10:24.680
(leaves rustling)

1174
01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:38.293
(dramatic music continues)

1175
01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:48.637
That's one heck of a view.
(Kate exhales)


1176
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.409
(dramatic music continues)

1177
01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:56.612
These guys are like
the freaking plague.


1178
01:10:59.849 --> 01:11:02.383
(gun clanking)

1179
01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:07.388
Come on, come on. Keep up.
(gunshots blasting)


1180
01:11:11.761 --> 01:11:13.562
Come on, keep up.

1181
01:11:13.596 --> 01:11:16.065
- Easy for you to
say, Mr. Navy Seal.


1182
01:11:16.098 --> 01:11:17.566
I don't usually
spent my time running


1183
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.836
around the mountain at altitude
being chased by a maniac.


1184
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:22.505
(gunshots blasting)

1185
01:11:22.538 --> 01:11:26.175
- Yeah, well, now you know
what feels like to be an elk.


1186
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.910
So, next time I
take you hunting,


1187
01:11:27.943 --> 01:11:29.444
you'll have new insight
into how to stalk a bull,


1188
01:11:29.477 --> 01:11:31.247
and you'll be able
to get yourself one.


1189
01:11:31.279 --> 01:11:32.882
- Assuming there is a next hunt.

1190
01:11:34.449 --> 01:11:35.718
- I got one more
trick on my sleeve.


1191
01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:36.619
Come on.

1192
01:11:39.221 --> 01:11:42.423
(gunshots blasting)

1193
01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:49.364
(dramatic music continues)

1194
01:11:54.904 --> 01:11:58.073
- This is your plan,
getting us killed?


1195
01:11:58.107 --> 01:12:00.408
No way, I don't do water.

1196
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.077
You should just kill them.

1197
01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:03.679
- Yeah?

1198
01:12:03.712 --> 01:12:05.748
Do you wanna stay here and
die, or do you wanna live?


1199
01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:08.784
(gunshots blasting)

1200
01:12:10.219 --> 01:12:11.287
(water splashing)

1201
01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:12.688
(Kate screaming)

1202
01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:14.857
(water sloshing)

1203
01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.626
(Kate gasping)

1204
01:12:19.195 --> 01:12:21.797
(water sloshing)

1205
01:12:24.567 --> 01:12:28.304
(dramatic music continues)

1206
01:12:28.336 --> 01:12:30.739
Okay, there's a rapid ahead.

1207
01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:36.512
(gunshot blasting)

1208
01:12:37.345 --> 01:12:38.881
Stay on me.

1209
01:12:38.914 --> 01:12:40.850
(gunshot blasting)

1210
01:12:40.883 --> 01:12:43.719
(water sloshing)

1211
01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:48.958
Here we go.

1212
01:12:52.228 --> 01:12:52.962
Stay calm.

1213
01:12:54.964 --> 01:12:59.969
(water sloshing)
(dramatic music continues)


1214
01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:08.811
Hold your breath.

1215
01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:10.478
(water sloshing)

1216
01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:13.616
(Jackson gasping)

1217
01:13:14.415 --> 01:13:16.952
(Kate screaming)

1218
01:13:16.986 --> 01:13:22.390
(water roaring)
(dramatic music continues)


1219
01:13:27.496 --> 01:13:29.798
- [Kate] Jackson, Jackson.

1220
01:13:32.635 --> 01:13:34.770
Jackson, where are you?

1221
01:13:36.338 --> 01:13:41.510
(water sloshing)
(dramatic music continues)


1222
01:13:42.578 --> 01:13:44.179
- They're in the
river, headed down.


1223
01:13:44.213 --> 01:13:45.547
Fan out.

1224
01:13:45.581 --> 01:13:47.283
Search the banks and any
possible egress points.


1225
01:13:47.316 --> 01:13:50.886
(dramatic music continues)

1226
01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:54.256
(water sloshing)

1227
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.990
- Jackson.

1228
01:13:58.426 --> 01:13:59.528
Jackson.

1229
01:14:01.897 --> 01:14:03.399
Jackson.

1230
01:14:03.431 --> 01:14:08.604
(water splashing)
(Jackson gasping)


1231
01:14:09.238 --> 01:14:09.872
- You okay?

1232
01:14:10.839 --> 01:14:12.308
- Great.

1233
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:13.409
Never been better.

1234
01:14:13.441 --> 01:14:14.677
(Jackson gasping)

1235
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.945
- [Jackson] At
least you're alive.


1236
01:14:15.978 --> 01:14:17.680
Look on the bright side.

1237
01:14:17.713 --> 01:14:19.982
Most tourists pay hundreds of
dollars to float that river.


1238
01:14:20.015 --> 01:14:21.350
You got it for free.

1239
01:14:21.383 --> 01:14:23.085
(Jackson gasping)

1240
01:14:23.118 --> 01:14:25.587
- Most tourists do it in a
raft and don't almost die.


1241
01:14:25.621 --> 01:14:27.656
- Yeah, well, I never
said I was a rafting guy.


1242
01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:29.425
Now, listen, we
gotta get outta here.


1243
01:14:29.457 --> 01:14:31.961
We bought us some
time but not a lot.


1244
01:14:31.994 --> 01:14:32.861
Let's go.

1245
01:14:32.895 --> 01:14:34.330
(water sloshing)

1246
01:14:34.363 --> 01:14:36.398
(dramatic music continues)

1247
01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:39.001
(wind howling)

1248
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:45.473
(footsteps plodding)

1249
01:14:52.348 --> 01:14:54.416
- Jackson, it's so cold.

1250
01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:55.517
- I know. Come on.

1251
01:14:55.551 --> 01:14:56.652
- We gotta get outta here.

1252
01:14:56.685 --> 01:14:57.553
- We're almost there.

1253
01:14:57.586 --> 01:14:58.454
Keep moving.

1254
01:14:58.486 --> 01:14:59.922
Come on.

1255
01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:00.956
Don't quit. Come on.

1256
01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:06.962
(wind howling)
(dramatic music continues)


1257
01:15:10.733 --> 01:15:12.801
(footsteps plodding)

1258
01:15:12.835 --> 01:15:14.603
Okay, okay.

1259
01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:16.271
- What's the plan?

1260
01:15:16.305 --> 01:15:17.873
- We're gonna take this
road back to the trailhead,


1261
01:15:17.906 --> 01:15:20.075
and my truck, it's
about four miles.


1262
01:15:20.109 --> 01:15:21.610
- Four miles?

1263
01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:23.445
- Yep, yep, we're gonna
move fast on this road,


1264
01:15:23.479 --> 01:15:24.747
get back to my truck.

1265
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.415
I got some toys
that'll even the odds.


1266
01:15:26.448 --> 01:15:29.418
(footsteps plodding)
(engine humming)


1267
01:15:29.451 --> 01:15:31.086
Well, I'll be.

1268
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.455
Guess we won't have to
walk all the way after all.


1269
01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:34.757
Come on.

1270
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:39.895
(footsteps plodding)
(engine humming)


1271
01:15:40.529 --> 01:15:41.498
You good?

1272
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:42.865
It's a friend of mine.

1273
01:15:42.898 --> 01:15:45.734
(engine humming)

1274
01:15:56.979 --> 01:15:58.647
(brakes squeaking)

1275
01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.050
(brakes hissing)

1276
01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:02.751
(door clattering)

1277
01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.521
- Jackson, what are you
doing way the fuck out here?


1278
01:16:04.553 --> 01:16:05.421
(Jackson laughs)

1279
01:16:05.454 --> 01:16:06.922
- Was on a hunt.

1280
01:16:06.955 --> 01:16:08.791
Uh, our horses got spooked
and left us on foot.


1281
01:16:08.824 --> 01:16:10.459
We were walking
back to my truck.


1282
01:16:10.492 --> 01:16:12.761
Do you think we could,
uh, catch a ride?


1283
01:16:12.795 --> 01:16:15.130
- Yeah, my passenger's
seat had that fire, though.


1284
01:16:15.164 --> 01:16:16.131
Jump in the back.

1285
01:16:16.165 --> 01:16:17.466
There's plenty of room.

1286
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.201
- Murph, this is
Kate, my client.


1287
01:16:19.234 --> 01:16:20.636
- What are you doing
with a roughneck like him


1288
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:22.137
way the fuck out here, sweetie?

1289
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:23.138
(Kate laughs)

1290
01:16:23.172 --> 01:16:24.507
- He's not so bad.

1291
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:25.508
- All right, come on.

1292
01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:26.509
Jump in the back.

1293
01:16:26.543 --> 01:16:28.143
(footsteps plodding)

1294
01:16:28.177 --> 01:16:31.380
(metal clanging)

1295
01:16:31.413 --> 01:16:32.748
(door clattering)

1296
01:16:32.781 --> 01:16:34.850
(wrench thudding)
(Jackson grunting)


1297
01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:36.553
Get up and in the back, sweetie.

1298
01:16:36.585 --> 01:16:37.554
Get up and in there
with your boyfriend.


1299
01:16:37.586 --> 01:16:39.054
Get up. Get in.

1300
01:16:40.089 --> 01:16:41.390
Lemme see your hands.

1301
01:16:41.423 --> 01:16:42.491
Get up and in there. Lay down.

1302
01:16:42.525 --> 01:16:45.194
(metal clanging)

1303
01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:54.136
(dramatic music)

1304
01:16:57.172 --> 01:16:58.073
- Jackson.

1305
01:16:59.576 --> 01:17:00.676
Jackson, Jackson.

1306
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:05.948
Jackson.

1307
01:17:07.483 --> 01:17:10.419
(footsteps plodding)

1308
01:17:10.452 --> 01:17:15.090
- Oh, here's the
cute couple, huh?


1309
01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:16.658
How you doing, honey?

1310
01:17:16.692 --> 01:17:17.926
You gonna tell Uncle Murph

1311
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.195
where that money is now?
(hand slapping)


1312
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:21.663
- Don't touch me.

1313
01:17:22.931 --> 01:17:24.933
I told you I don't know
where Jackson put the money.


1314
01:17:24.967 --> 01:17:26.603
- Huh?

1315
01:17:26.635 --> 01:17:30.472
Come on, tell Uncle
Murph where the money is.


1316
01:17:30.507 --> 01:17:31.640
- I just came up
here to go hunting


1317
01:17:31.673 --> 01:17:33.876
and spread my father's ashes.

1318
01:17:33.909 --> 01:17:37.746
- Oh, were you
daddy's little girl?


1319
01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:39.081
Where's the money?

1320
01:17:39.114 --> 01:17:40.482
(Jackson groaning)

1321
01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:42.117
Where's the money?

1322
01:17:42.151 --> 01:17:43.485
- Eat shit.

1323
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.987
- Oh, honey, I need a yard

1324
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.889
of your shit to
kiss your asshole.


1325
01:17:46.922 --> 01:17:48.190
Where's the fucking money?

1326
01:17:48.223 --> 01:17:50.225
- I told you I don't know.

1327
01:17:50.259 --> 01:17:51.860
- You lizard-brained bitch.
(foot thudding)


1328
01:17:51.894 --> 01:17:54.096
You're gonna to tell
me sooner or later.


1329
01:17:55.498 --> 01:17:56.566
- [Jackson] No.

1330
01:17:56.599 --> 01:17:58.033
- Oh, look who's waking up?

1331
01:17:59.468 --> 01:18:00.769
Oh, Jackson.

1332
01:18:00.802 --> 01:18:01.904
(Jackson groaning)

1333
01:18:01.937 --> 01:18:04.106
Look who's waking up?

1334
01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:05.240
(hand slapping)

1335
01:18:05.274 --> 01:18:07.109
Jackson, Jackson, come on.

1336
01:18:08.076 --> 01:18:09.646
Wake up now.

1337
01:18:09.678 --> 01:18:10.779
Time to talk to Uncle Murph.
(hand thudding)


1338
01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:13.448
Hey, Jackson, come on.

1339
01:18:13.482 --> 01:18:14.783
Wake up.

1340
01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:16.118
Time to talk to
Uncle Murph, buddy.


1341
01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:17.252
Come on.

1342
01:18:17.286 --> 01:18:18.720
Come on, Jackson.

1343
01:18:18.754 --> 01:18:21.524
We're gonna go have
a nice talk now.


1344
01:18:21.558 --> 01:18:24.259
(dramatic music)

1345
01:18:25.562 --> 01:18:26.261
(case thudding)

1346
01:18:26.295 --> 01:18:27.630
Oh, Jackson.

1347
01:18:27.664 --> 01:18:28.931
(knives clinking)

1348
01:18:28.964 --> 01:18:30.966
Time to wake up, Jackson.

1349
01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:33.135
(knives clinking)

1350
01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:33.835
Hey, Jackson.

1351
01:18:33.869 --> 01:18:34.937
(hand thudding)

1352
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:36.606
Jackson, wake the fuck up.

1353
01:18:36.639 --> 01:18:37.940
(knives clinking)

1354
01:18:37.973 --> 01:18:39.274
Where's the fucking
money, Jackson?


1355
01:18:39.308 --> 01:18:40.809
Where's the fucking money?

1356
01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:41.810
(knife slapping)
(Jackson grunting)


1357
01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:43.979
(Jackson gasping)

1358
01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:46.549
You know, Jackson, I never
thought that this would be


1359
01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:48.417
where I'm coming
outta retirement.


1360
01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:51.019
I always thought a couple months
you'd come looking for me,


1361
01:18:51.053 --> 01:18:52.821
and I'd have to
pick up the tools


1362
01:18:52.854 --> 01:18:54.691
just to tie up some loose ends.

1363
01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:56.626
I never really thought
that I'd be coming


1364
01:18:56.659 --> 01:18:58.493
around here chasing you.

1365
01:18:58.528 --> 01:19:00.062
Ain't life a fucking bitch?

1366
01:19:00.095 --> 01:19:02.931
Now, where's the
fucking money, Jackson?


1367
01:19:02.965 --> 01:19:04.132
- Where's the girl?

1368
01:19:05.801 --> 01:19:07.637
- I've already questioned
her, and she didn't come


1369
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:09.304
across with anything whatsoever.

1370
01:19:09.338 --> 01:19:11.708
That's the only reason
you're still alive.


1371
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.942
Where is the
motherfucking money?


1372
01:19:13.976 --> 01:19:15.877
(dramatic music continues)

1373
01:19:15.911 --> 01:19:18.847
You know, it's been a while,
but it's like riding a bike.


1374
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.349
(knives clinking)

1375
01:19:20.382 --> 01:19:22.317
I'll just pick it right
up where I left off.


1376
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.353
Where is the fucking money?

1377
01:19:25.787 --> 01:19:26.855
(hand thudding)
(Jackson grunting)


1378
01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:28.558
Where is the fucking money?

1379
01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:31.026
- Oh, I'm sure you still know
how to do your job, Murph.


1380
01:19:31.059 --> 01:19:34.062
Those skills, once
you learn 'em,


1381
01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:36.865
they're kinda hard to forget.

1382
01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.167
Believe me, I tried.

1383
01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:42.004
Never saw it coming.

1384
01:19:42.037 --> 01:19:43.740
- Well, you know, I had to
do a little role-playing


1385
01:19:43.772 --> 01:19:45.874
out here in the
country, you know?


1386
01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:48.043
I mean, I really did.

1387
01:19:48.076 --> 01:19:49.911
I really liked it, too.

1388
01:19:49.945 --> 01:19:51.947
You know, I shoulda
been an actor.


1389
01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.950
That pilot, Nate, he
was a friend of mine.


1390
01:19:54.983 --> 01:19:57.853
I was supposed to pick
him up at the border.


1391
01:19:57.886 --> 01:20:01.557
What'd you do, take a sack
of money off a dead guy,


1392
01:20:01.591 --> 01:20:02.625
(laughing) you sick fuck?

1393
01:20:02.659 --> 01:20:04.359
(Murph laughing)

1394
01:20:04.393 --> 01:20:06.895
Ah, I woulda done the same
fucking thing, Jackson.


1395
01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:08.598
Don't get me wrong.

1396
01:20:08.631 --> 01:20:10.065
I like you and the
people out here.


1397
01:20:10.098 --> 01:20:14.136
I also like $100 million,
and some Mai Tais,


1398
01:20:14.169 --> 01:20:16.639
and some strippers
on the beach, huh?


1399
01:20:16.673 --> 01:20:18.006
That would be nice.

1400
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.642
- I know what you mean, Murph.

1401
01:20:19.676 --> 01:20:22.044
(dramatic music continues)

1402
01:20:22.077 --> 01:20:23.746
So, how's this
gonna go Murph, huh?


1403
01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.113
(knives clinking)

1404
01:20:25.147 --> 01:20:28.584
You gonna torture
me, make me talk?


1405
01:20:28.618 --> 01:20:30.952
- Yeah, something
just like that.


1406
01:20:30.986 --> 01:20:34.456
But you know, we could
save all that mess.


1407
01:20:34.489 --> 01:20:38.628
All you gotta do is tell me
where the fucking money is.


1408
01:20:38.661 --> 01:20:40.162
That's all, and then it'll end

1409
01:20:40.195 --> 01:20:42.164
a little differently, all right?

1410
01:20:43.398 --> 01:20:44.366
(knife thudding)

1411
01:20:44.399 --> 01:20:45.267
- Tell you what, Murph.

1412
01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:48.136
(dramatic music continues)

1413
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.038
This life's kicked my ass.

1414
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.743
My daughter dies.

1415
01:20:53.776 --> 01:20:55.243
My wife cheats on me.

1416
01:20:56.912 --> 01:20:58.980
Got (laughs) more bills
than I got fucking money.


1417
01:21:00.849 --> 01:21:03.418
My body's old and broken.

1418
01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:04.654
(dramatic music continues)

1419
01:21:04.687 --> 01:21:06.221
- Oh, poor Jackson.

1420
01:21:06.254 --> 01:21:10.425
You're really gonna make me
lose some sleep over your life?


1421
01:21:10.459 --> 01:21:11.360
Come on.

1422
01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:14.831
I need to know where
that fucking money is.


1423
01:21:14.863 --> 01:21:17.466
Are we seeing eye
to eye, big boy?


1424
01:21:19.134 --> 01:21:21.069
- But ain't muscle memory
a funny thing, Murph?


1425
01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:24.906
Yeah, muscle memory.

1426
01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.441
You know when you do something,

1427
01:21:26.475 --> 01:21:29.077
no matter how long it's
been since you done it,


1428
01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:31.079
the body remembers how to do it.

1429
01:21:32.548 --> 01:21:36.418
Yeah, you know, like take, uh,
picking a lock for example.


1430
01:21:38.253 --> 01:21:39.856
- What?

1431
01:21:39.888 --> 01:21:40.989
(dramatic music continues)
(chain clanking)


1432
01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:41.890
(fist thudding)
(Murph grunting)


1433
01:21:41.923 --> 01:21:43.058
(body thudding)

1434
01:21:43.091 --> 01:21:44.159
(dramatic music continues)

1435
01:21:44.192 --> 01:21:46.428
- Now, we see eye to eye, Murph.

1436
01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:50.899
(chain clanking)

1437
01:21:50.932 --> 01:21:53.335
(dramatic music continues)

1438
01:21:53.368 --> 01:21:56.238
(door clattering)

1439
01:21:57.774 --> 01:21:59.007
(metal clanging)

1440
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.175
(metal bar whooshing)

1441
01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:01.009
Kate?

1442
01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:02.879
(footsteps plodding)

1443
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:05.748
(engine humming)

1444
01:22:05.782 --> 01:22:07.750
(footsteps plodding)
Kate.


1445
01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:10.485
(engine humming)

1446
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:18.260
(door clattering)

1447
01:22:20.395 --> 01:22:21.764
(gun clanking)

1448
01:22:21.798 --> 01:22:25.501
(footsteps plodding)

1449
01:22:25.535 --> 01:22:26.401
Kate.

1450
01:22:28.303 --> 01:22:29.505
(gun clanking)

1451
01:22:29.539 --> 01:22:32.307
(feet thudding)

1452
01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:36.044
(door slamming)

1453
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.450
(feet thudding)

1454
01:22:41.483 --> 01:22:44.554
(footsteps plodding)

1455
01:22:49.424 --> 01:22:50.793
Kate.

1456
01:22:50.827 --> 01:22:52.093
Oh, my God.
(footsteps plodding)


1457
01:22:52.127 --> 01:22:53.261
Are you okay?
(metal bar thudding)


1458
01:22:53.295 --> 01:22:54.196
- Fine.

1459
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:57.032
You have some
interesting friends.


1460
01:22:57.065 --> 01:22:58.066
Murph is a real asshole.

1461
01:22:58.099 --> 01:22:59.334
(metal clanging)

1462
01:22:59.367 --> 01:23:00.870
- Yeah, I know.

1463
01:23:00.903 --> 01:23:02.103
We gotta get outta here.

1464
01:23:02.137 --> 01:23:04.473
(footsteps plodding)

1465
01:23:04.507 --> 01:23:07.309
(door creaking)

1466
01:23:08.511 --> 01:23:11.079
(gun clanking)

1467
01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:11.948
We've been followed.

1468
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.949
(ties snapping)

1469
01:23:12.981 --> 01:23:14.316
- It's him, isn't it?

1470
01:23:14.349 --> 01:23:15.183
(metal clanging)

1471
01:23:15.217 --> 01:23:16.819
- Yeah.
(ties snapping)


1472
01:23:16.853 --> 01:23:17.553
Later.

(fists thudding)

1496
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.888
- It's just me and
you now, frog man,


1497
01:24:25.922 --> 01:24:28.290
and I eat seals for breakfast.

Looks like that's the end
of your little girlfriend.


1512

You're next.

(feet shuffling)

1527

01:26:03.019 --> 01:26:05.521
(Kate laughs)

1530

Are you?

1531
01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:10.258
- Same.

1532
01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.162
Are all your hunting
trips this much fun?


1533
01:26:16.098 --> 01:26:18.299
- Yeah, all of 'em.

1534
01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.903
(Jackson sighs)

1535
01:26:20.936 --> 01:26:24.540
Sometimes you get to play
the hunter, not the hunted.


1536
01:26:28.744 --> 01:26:31.113
(Jackson sighs)

1537
01:26:31.147 --> 01:26:33.314
What do you say we
get some clothes on,


1538
01:26:34.349 --> 01:26:35.518
go get that money?

(Kate laughs)

1540
01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:40.790

(thunder rumbling)

1551
01:27:44.419 --> 01:27:46.321
Should we open it?

1552
01:27:47.255 --> 01:27:48.356
- Yeah.

1553
01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:52.293

(latches clicking)

1555
01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:02.238
That is a ton of cash.

1556
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:03.773
(Kate laughs)

1557
01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:04.874
- Just one more thing.

1558
01:28:09.545 --> 01:28:12.648
- Well, I guess you'll never
forget your first hunt, huh?


1559
01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:15.283
- It's not over yet.

1560
01:28:17.153 --> 01:28:19.822
(birds chirping)

1561
01:28:21.322 --> 01:28:22.691
- Ain't it funny, though?

1562
01:28:24.894 --> 01:28:29.632
You did all those martial
arts, you know, for your dad,


1563
01:28:31.366 --> 01:28:32.768
learned how to shoot a gun,

1564
01:28:35.336 --> 01:28:37.740
but you never went
hunting with him.


1565

(Jackson groaning)

1571
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:03.431
Why? Why?

1572
01:29:08.304 --> 01:29:09.238
Why?

1573
01:29:09.271 --> 01:29:10.639
(Jackson coughs)

1574
01:29:10.673 --> 01:29:11.907

(walkie-talkie beeping)

1580
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:27.723

(Jackson gasps)

1582
01:29:29.457 --> 01:29:32.795
- I recruited you
to kill my enemies.


1583
01:29:32.828 --> 01:29:33.796
- What?

1584
01:29:33.829 --> 01:29:36.364
(Jackson gasping)

1585
01:29:36.397 --> 01:29:37.566

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.402
(Jackson gasping)

1587
01:29:42.403 --> 01:29:43.606

(Jackson groans)

1589
01:29:47.643 --> 01:29:52.447
- You did exactly what
we knew you would do.


1590
01:29:53.315 --> 01:29:57.452
(Jackson groaning and gasping)

1591
01:29:59.355 --> 01:30:00.756

1609

I'm gonna kill that bitch.
