00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.243
Coming up on KTLA 5:

2
00:00:57.742 --> 00:00:59.784
This season's hottest Christmas
gifts!


3
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.243
It's November 1st people,
give us a break!


4
00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.282
Hi.

5
00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:25.407
How's your day so far?

6
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.657
You heard, right?

7
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.115
Barely into my first episode
and already it's a mess.


8
00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:30.281
Potential mess.

9
00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:32.340
Anyway, why do you think
I recommended you for this job?


10
00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:33.715
Because I haven't worked
in almost a year


11
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.620
and my career was vanishing
before my very eyes?


12
00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:36.989
Guess again.

13
00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:38.322
Because I'm your oldest friend?

14
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.155
Because you're smart
and resourceful,


15
00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:41.277
and good at troubleshooting.

16
00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:43.323
And there's plenty of trouble
to shoot around here.


17
00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:44.406
Now you tell me.

18
00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:45.696
It's true, you can handle it.

19
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.696
Except for getting over
that cheat Marco


20
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.946
and the whole man embargo.

21
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.821
It's been way too long, Soph.

22
00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.530
Over Marco. No embargo.
Not looking.


23
00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.214
Please! If you're living,
you're looking.


24
00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:00.112
Sophia! Sit, please. Help.

25
00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.404
I always thought
the Sexy Santa Society


26
00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:05.737
sounded a little... sketchy.

27
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.213
Who knew they were going
to get busted


28
00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:09.237
for running an
illegal escort ring?


29
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.279
And we just thought they
serviced shopping malls.


30
00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:13.528
They certainly put the "ho"
in "ho-ho-ho."


31
00:02:13.986 --> 00:02:15.962
To be honest, I always thought
doing a whole episode


32
00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:17.653
on the group seemed
a little exploitive.


33
00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:20.153
Even for a show called
"Extreme Holidays."


34
00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:22.653
Oh, I'm sorry we aren't as noble

35
00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:24.819
as the cooking shows
that you were working on.


36
00:02:24.903 --> 00:02:27.443
Yeah, well, there's nothing
noble about getting cancelled.


37
00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:29.485
Or being unemployed.

38
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:30.402
Ain't that right?

39
00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:32.527
Now, check out the article
I just sent you, okay?


40
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.985
I forgot all about this guy,
but it just might work.


41
00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:39.693
Guy celebrates Christmas

42
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.651
- Yeah.
- I can hardly handle it one day.


43
00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:43.984
That's why we're not doing
a show about you.


44
00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.651
What kind of oddball is this
Will Saunders?


45
00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.276
A devoted one, apparently.

46
00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.609
His house is a shrine
to all things yuletide.


47
00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.151
And he does charity work:

48
00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.608
kids, pets, and homeless people.

49
00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:56.059
So, he should want to do this.

50
00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:58.108
And, if he's not
a complete freak,


51
00:02:58.191 --> 00:02:59.191
we should want to, too.

52
00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:00.542
I can't even tell
what he looks like


53
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:01.847
underneath this reindeer get up.

54
00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:04.775
Nothing about his personal life
except for 33,


55
00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:08.982
has a history in production
and carpentry in scenic design.


56
00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:09.940
That makes sense, I guess?

57
00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.291
I just sent you the number
from the studio where he works.


58
00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:14.649
I want you to find him,
meet him, and sell him.


59
00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:15.982
You have one day, sorry.

60
00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:17.524
I'm on it!

61
00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:21.315
Oh, and don't forget that
the entire Bravada TV deal,


62
00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.523
not to mention your future
as a producer here,


63
00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:25.398
hinges on the success
of this show.


64
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.356
So... no pressure.

65
00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:29.564
None at all.

66
00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:31.356
Thank you!

67
00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:43.313
No Twitter, no Instagram...

68
00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:45.397
Social media ghost.

69
00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.062
Hi, is this Will?

70
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:01.146
Will, this is Sophia Worthy.

71
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.604
I'm with Super Real Productions.

72
00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:05.561
I am producing a new reality
TV show about the holidays,


73
00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:06.645
and we...

74
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.829
I got your phone number
from your work,


75
00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:11.103
I hope that's okay.

76
00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:14.645
Anyway, this whole "every day
is Christmas" thing you do


77
00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:15.978
sounds really...

78
00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:17.894
fascinating...

79
00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:19.435
and I wondered if we could meet

80
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.269
and talk about filming you
for the show?


81
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.352
Oh, can I ask you why not?

82
00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:29.019
Well, yeah, it's reality TV,
but not how you think...


83
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:32.518
That's a drag.

84
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:33.910
You know, it really
could have brought


85
00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:36.559
a lot of attention to all that
great charity work you do.


86
00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:39.643
Oh yeah!

87
00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.393
It could have been
a big part of it.


88
00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:43.934
Amazing!

89
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.642
How does tomorrow morning sound?

90
00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:48.933
Yes, I do know that place.

91
00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:50.975
10:00 a.m.? Perfect!

92
00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:52.808
I'll see you then.

93
00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.058
Okay, bye.

94
00:04:57.308 --> 00:04:58.475
Charmer.

95
00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:00.474
Yes!

96
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.515
Excuse me, Will?

97
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:15.598
Sophia from
Super Real Productions.


98
00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:18.431
Sorry, my bad.

99
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.390
I thought you were someone else.

100
00:05:21.015 --> 00:05:22.015
Sophia?

101
00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:26.514
You're Will?

102
00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:29.097
You were expecting an elf?

103
00:05:29.722 --> 00:05:30.722
Maybe?

104
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.347
What can I get you?

105
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.764
Oh no, it's on me.

106
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.514
Well, it's on Super Real
Productions, actually.


107
00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:39.305
What do you want?

108
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.638
Thank Super Real,
but it's on me.


109
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.929
No arguments.

110
00:05:43.763 --> 00:05:44.763
Okay.

111
00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:47.096
Medium, non-fat,
half-caf, no foam latte,


112
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:48.888
with a teaspoon of agave.

113
00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:50.096
Coming right up.

114
00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:59.637
Can I get a medium, non-fat,
no foam, half-caf latte,


115
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.553
with a teaspoon of agave?

116
00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:03.137
Christmas blend,

117
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.720
and just a regular
Christmas blend for me.


118
00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:27.218
Thanks.

119
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.551
What's this?

120
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:37.134
Just a little something for you.

121
00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:38.134
Open it.

122
00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:40.384
My first gift from
Mr. Christmas.


123
00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:42.259
I could get used to this.

124
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:43.425
Is that so?

125
00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:45.509
I mean...

126
00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:48.134
I meant, the gifts
you must give...


127
00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:52.258
The pink one's strawberry,
the yellow is lemon,


128
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:54.258
and the orange is passion fruit.

129
00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:56.758
How did you know I liked
macaroons?


130
00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:58.299
Just a guess.

131
00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.883
They seem kind of fancy...
like you.


132
00:07:02.133 --> 00:07:03.133
Fancy?

133
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:04.965
Interesting.

134
00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:09.048
Hope you like Christmas blend,
I used it for your latte.


135
00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:10.590
It may or may not surprise you

136
00:07:10.673 --> 00:07:12.340
that I wait for it
all year long.


137
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.715
I love Christmas blend,
it's my favorite.


138
00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:16.798
Yay!

139
00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:20.506
So you live around here?

140
00:07:20.714 --> 00:07:22.756
Yeah, I'm in Vista Gardens.

141
00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:24.964
A little bungalow
right in the canyon.


142
00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:26.589
I know the place, actually.

143
00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:27.506
Really?

144
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:30.131
Yeah, a friend of mine used to
live right next door, I think.


145
00:07:30.214 --> 00:07:31.546
Beautiful spot. Quaint.

146
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.630
So, the show.

147
00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:37.921
The show, right.

148
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:40.130
Look, I don't want
to disappoint you...


149
00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:41.421
But I'm a pretty low-key guy

150
00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:47.004
and the whole reality show deal
just isn't really my thing.


151
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.004
And honestly, people don't
understand what I do.


152
00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:52.462
Or why I do it.

153
00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:55.754
Then let's change their mind.

154
00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:58.962
You could create a whole
new massive wave


155
00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.753
of Christmas enthusiasm!

156
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:03.253
What's in it for you, exactly?

157
00:08:03.878 --> 00:08:05.378
A skeptic, are we?

158
00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:07.169
Been down this road before.

159
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:11.711
Okay... the truth?

160
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.293
Our story just fell through

161
00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:18.877
and if we don't find a new one
ASAP we're screwed.


162
00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:22.460
My last show went belly up
and I need to prove myself.


163
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:23.835
To be honest with you,

164
00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:25.599
I don't know if you are right
for the show,


165
00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:27.292
not until I see your house.

166
00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:29.292
But after meeting you,

167
00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:31.459
I think you could be
great on television.


168
00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.084
How's that, mystery man?

169
00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:36.834
That was honest. 
I'm impressed.

170
00:08:39.084 --> 00:08:40.459
And between you and me,

171
00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:42.875
I am cuckoo for Christmas.

172
00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:50.375
Producing a show like this
would be a dream come true.


173
00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:52.375
If you like my house.

174
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:54.250
Right, I'd have to see
your house first.


175
00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:56.290
So can I?

176
00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:58.582
I'm not sure.
I'll have to think about it.


177
00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:00.707
Right, of course. Think about it
and let me know.


178
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.040
But I have to know
by the end of the day.


179
00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:04.499
So...

180
00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:07.082
he's not the oddball you
thought he was going to be?


181
00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:09.498
Nope, he's actually
kind of a regular guy


182
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.998
with an irregular hobby.

183
00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:13.289
And he's also kind of
on the hot side.


184
00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:15.789
Really? How hot?

185
00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:19.581
Like fireman meets GQ model
meets superhero hot.


186
00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:21.831
You're going to like him.

187
00:09:22.206 --> 00:09:23.080
I'm married.

188
00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:25.372
I don't have the luxury
of liking anyone anymore.


189
00:09:32.122 --> 00:09:33.455
4:45.

190
00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:35.788
End of day.

191
00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:47.496
Hey.

192
00:09:47.704 --> 00:09:50.079
Will? Hi, it's Sophia Worthy.

193
00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:51.953
Ah, Sophia Worthy.

194
00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:53.620
Is it the end of the day
already?


195
00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:54.870
We're getting there.

196
00:09:54.953 --> 00:09:56.245
So, what did you decide?

197
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.846
Wow, cutting right to the chase.

198
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.304
Listen Will, if you're
not going to do it,


199
00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:00.370
please just tell me now.

200
00:10:00.703 --> 00:10:02.411
Okay, I don't want to do it.

201
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.870
Oh...

202
00:10:04.577 --> 00:10:06.035
But that doesn't mean I won't.

203
00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:07.410
Or that I will.

204
00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:09.202
I'm confused.

205
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.202
At this point, all I can offer

206
00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:13.077
is an invitation for you
to see my home.


207
00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:16.160
How's half an hour?

208
00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:17.994
Nothing like playing
hard to get.


209
00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.284
Is that what you're doing?

210
00:10:20.284 --> 00:10:21.784
Let me give you my address.

211
00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:50.782
- Hi.
- Hey.


212
00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:52.449
Welcome to my humble abode.

213
00:10:52.907 --> 00:10:55.074
Humble? More like amazing.

214
00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:58.866
It was my grandparents home.
I inherited it.


215
00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:01.573
And who's this?

216
00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:03.990
This is Romeo.

217
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.031
My vicious guard dog.

218
00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:10.073
They're a pretty good
judge of character.


219
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.281
Come on!

220
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:18.280
I'd say holy cow,
but I'm assuming


221
00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:20.155
you've probably
heard something like it.


222
00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:21.947
Doesn't get old, trust me.

223
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.197
How do you keep
those floating like that?


224
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.447
They're suspended on a filament
that washes out in the light.


225
00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:28.696
Tricky.

226
00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:30.654
Tricks of the trade
in the movie business.


227
00:11:31.488 --> 00:11:32.488
Follow me.

228
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.113
Oh, and don't mind
the mistletoe.


229
00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:38.821
It's everywhere.

230
00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:41.487
Thanks for the warning.

231
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.570
Wow...

232
00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:49.298
How do you keep
those snowing like that?


233
00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:52.112
Wait, don't tell me!
More trade secrets?


234
00:11:54.487 --> 00:11:56.652
So, how did this all start?

235
00:11:56.736 --> 00:11:58.236
Honestly, I've always
loved Christmas.


236
00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:01.194
You could call me
a Christmas enthusiast.


237
00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:04.527
7 or 8 years ago I was working
on a small Christmas movie


238
00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:05.944
that ran out of money.

239
00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:09.526
So they paid me with
scenery and special effects.


240
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.877
Which was cool,
but then I thought


241
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:12.693
where the hell am I
going to put it all


242
00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:14.068
when it's not Christmas?

243
00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:15.568
And the rest is history?

244
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:17.610
Or hysteria, take your pick.

245
00:12:19.818 --> 00:12:22.610
It's gorgeous.
And a little trippy.


246
00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.275
But in a good way!

247
00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:25.859
Over here, come on.

248
00:12:26.692 --> 00:12:29.734
May I present:
Christmas under the Sea.


249
00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:32.650
It is so romantic. And peaceful.

250
00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:34.067
Unless you're the seasick type.

251
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.567
Which I'm not.

252
00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:38.733
A friend of yours?

253
00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:40.899
Oh yeah, that's
my second cousin, Ariel.


254
00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:46.733
He loves the ladies, that one.

255
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.815
Little Romeo - did you teach him
everything he knows?


256
00:12:50.898 --> 00:12:52.107
Just gave him the name.

257
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:53.940
Good answer.

258
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.898
So... how long have you
lived here for?


259
00:12:57.482 --> 00:12:58.815
You said you inherited it?

260
00:12:59.148 --> 00:13:01.273
From my grandparents,
those two right there.


261
00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:02.398
It's so modern.

262
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.314
I had to gut the entire home:
Interior, exterior...


263
00:13:06.772 --> 00:13:08.064
But I kept the original bones.

264
00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:11.606
So now, it's modern
with a heritage spine.


265
00:13:11.689 --> 00:13:14.814
What about your parents?
They didn't want the house?


266
00:13:15.606 --> 00:13:18.771
I'm sure they would have,
but they died when I was a kid.


267
00:13:19.063 --> 00:13:21.730
Long story, but I actually grew
up here.


268
00:13:21.813 --> 00:13:22.980
With my grandparents.

269
00:13:23.063 --> 00:13:24.605
Who were major Christmas fans,

270
00:13:24.688 --> 00:13:26.480
and my inspiration
when I decided


271
00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:29.521
to turn my home into a
Christmas extravaganza.


272
00:13:30.896 --> 00:13:32.271
Extravagant it is.

273
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.604
Pop quiz,
Miss Cuckoo for Christmas:


274
00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:37.173
who's your favorite
ornament maker?


275
00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:38.979
Me?

276
00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:43.020
I don't know, I would say
I'm kind of like


277
00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:45.145
an equal opportunity
ornament fan.


278
00:13:45.687 --> 00:13:47.103
Ah, I get it.

279
00:13:47.603 --> 00:13:49.561
Wouldn't want to offend
any of Santa's helpers.


280
00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:50.894
Exactly!

281
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:02.643
And here we have
"The Train Room".


282
00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:05.018
All aboard?

283
00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:08.560
It's amazing.

284
00:14:08.977 --> 00:14:11.643
My grandpa was a big collector
who got me going on it.


285
00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:14.142
And when I started doing
all this to my home,


286
00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:15.976
the train set grew like crazy.

287
00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.434
I'm always working on it,
it keeps me busy...


288
00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:19.851
And out of trouble!

289
00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:21.809
Sorry about that!

290
00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:23.226
Hank, meet Sophia.

291
00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:24.684
Sophia, Hank: my right hand man.

292
00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:25.767
Nice to meet you.

293
00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:27.184
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

294
00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.975
Sophia wants to make us
TV stars.


295
00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:32.058
Will hasn't agreed to it yet.

296
00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:33.600
Help me out, would you?

297
00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:37.516
You guys, this looks so good.

298
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.975
It's going to look amazing
on TV.


299
00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:40.683
Which I haven't agreed to, yet.

300
00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.182
Sorry, I know.

301
00:14:42.307 --> 00:14:44.724
I'm a producer,
the wheels are always turning.


302
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.390
Right.

303
00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:48.182
Want to see it in action?

304
00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:49.265
Yeah.

305
00:14:49.432 --> 00:14:50.474
Check it out.

306
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:01.806
So good!

307
00:15:05.098 --> 00:15:06.348
Hank seems nice.

308
00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:07.764
He's the best.

309
00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:10.138
He stays here sometimes
when the shelter's full.


310
00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:12.153
And I hire him for odd jobs
here and there.


311
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.222
He's homeless?

312
00:15:13.305 --> 00:15:15.138
Without a permanent home.
For now.


313
00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:18.013
He had one, lost it.
Amongst other things.


314
00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:19.513
We're working on it.

315
00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:23.222
Will, your house is wonderful.

316
00:15:23.887 --> 00:15:27.262
I would love for you and
your home to star in our show.


317
00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:28.512
So what do you think?

318
00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:29.929
I think...

319
00:15:31.012 --> 00:15:33.346
How do I know you won't
make me look like an idiot?


320
00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:36.096
You've just got to trust me,
I guess.


321
00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:37.304
Yeah?

322
00:15:37.553 --> 00:15:38.553
Yeah.

323
00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:40.636
For what it's worth,

324
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.095
I'd like to mention that I was

325
00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:44.261
a documentary film major
in college.


326
00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:45.928
So I know how to get to
the truth.


327
00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:47.345
Really?

328
00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:49.428
So why reality TV?

329
00:15:50.345 --> 00:15:52.677
I suppose real life
got in the way?


330
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.135
Something called paying
the bills came knocking.


331
00:15:55.469 --> 00:15:56.635
Fair enough.

332
00:15:56.719 --> 00:15:58.552
I'd also like to mention
that we are willing


333
00:15:58.635 --> 00:16:02.052
to make a serious donation
to a charity of choice.


334
00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:04.385
You're killing me.

335
00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:07.968
I just...

336
00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:11.134
I don't know.

337
00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:15.468
Your house is unbelievable,
Will.


338
00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:18.801
The way you do Christmas and
the legacy of your grandparents.


339
00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:21.883
How great would it be to,
on screen,


340
00:16:21.967 --> 00:16:24.508
show everybody
the beauty of that?


341
00:16:24.758 --> 00:16:27.258
I just know that people
would flip over you,


342
00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:28.675
and your home and your story.

343
00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:30.717
And why you do it,
and how you do it.


344
00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.174
Your house is one of a kind.

345
00:16:35.174 --> 00:16:36.341
You're one of a kind.

346
00:16:45.007 --> 00:16:47.298
I have to confer with
my business manager.


347
00:16:51.715 --> 00:16:52.916
What do you think?

348
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.340
Okay.

349
00:16:57.423 --> 00:16:58.256
Okay?

350
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.423
We'll do it.

351
00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:02.797
Will, this is amazing!
Thank you!


352
00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:04.922
You are not going
to regret this!


353
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.422
Who's the happy camper?

354
00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:18.129
Oh, you'll find out...

355
00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:38.003
Wow, what a beauty!

356
00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:40.003
Imagine when it's all
decorated and lit up!


357
00:17:40.087 --> 00:17:41.420
I bet the crowds are crazy.

358
00:17:41.837 --> 00:17:43.877
Yes, but his crabby neighbor
hates those crowds.


359
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:45.002
He got an injunction,

360
00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:47.627
so he's not allowed to start
decorating until Thanksgiving.


361
00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:48.961
Nice neighbor.

362
00:17:49.044 --> 00:17:50.294
So, plan accordingly, Linz.

363
00:17:50.377 --> 00:17:51.377
I know the type.

364
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:54.169
He'll be the first to want a
location fee. Guaranteed.


365
00:17:54.252 --> 00:17:55.252
Let's go!

366
00:18:01.043 --> 00:18:02.210
The gang?

367
00:18:02.293 --> 00:18:05.668
Yes. Will, this is Lindsey,
Kayla, and Aaron.


368
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.085
Our A-team of lights,
camera and...


369
00:18:08.168 --> 00:18:09.418
- Action?
- Sound.


370
00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:11.875
Action is good too, Will.

371
00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:16.917
And this is Romeo, our
Extreme Holidays mascot.


372
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.542
Romeo, are you ready
for your close-up?


373
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.042
At least one of us is.

374
00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:29.999
Let me know if you have
any questions, okay?


375
00:18:30.624 --> 00:18:32.249
Yeah, I got one.

376
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:34.291
Got any idea what
a nightmare it is


377
00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:37.541
to shoot all this white
on white on white?


378
00:18:37.624 --> 00:18:39.540
Sorry, I didn't design it
with TV in mind, dude.


379
00:18:39.623 --> 00:18:41.748
Relax, Aaron.
I've seen you shoot tougher.


380
00:18:41.832 --> 00:18:44.582
All these projections could
be pretty tricky to light.


381
00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:45.957
Thanks, Kayla.

382
00:18:49.957 --> 00:18:51.040
Are you okay?

383
00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:54.081
Yeah, just taking it all in.

384
00:18:56.622 --> 00:18:58.581
Do you mind if they get
a lay of the land?


385
00:18:58.664 --> 00:18:59.831
Check things out a bit?

386
00:19:00.414 --> 00:19:02.414
Okay, that would be great.
Give us some more time.


387
00:19:02.497 --> 00:19:03.706
Fan out everyone!

388
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.913
Just don't go in any rooms
that are being redone!


389
00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:07.538
And watch out for wet paint!

390
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:08.621
It's okay.

391
00:19:11.538 --> 00:19:14.121
Your beautiful house is in
good hands. I promise.


392
00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:16.871
As are you.

393
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:20.995
I'm going to hold you to that.

394
00:19:24.037 --> 00:19:26.329
I'm gonna go follow them.
You want to join?


395
00:19:26.954 --> 00:19:28.329
Sure, after you.

396
00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:31.495
Thanks a lot, Will.

397
00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:33.578
We'll see you Monday morning.

398
00:19:34.328 --> 00:19:36.869
Monday? Like four days
from today, Monday?


399
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.095
Didn't you say your hiatus
started in four days?


400
00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:41.369
Yeah, but I've got a ton
of work to do on the house.


401
00:19:41.453 --> 00:19:42.328
No worries, Will.

402
00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:43.953
That's why the
crew is here to help.


403
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:47.036
No crew. Just me
and Hank only, please.


404
00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.511
You know what?
Why don't you guys go?


405
00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:49.678
I'm just going to grab an Uber

406
00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:51.136
and chat with Will
about a few things.


407
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160
Shotgun!

408
00:19:59.535 --> 00:20:00.535
Fred!

409
00:20:03.826 --> 00:20:05.107
What's all the hubbub, Saunders?

410
00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:06.576
Reality TV show.

411
00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:08.117
This is my producer, Sophia.

412
00:20:08.201 --> 00:20:09.492
Sophia, meet Fred.

413
00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:10.576
Hi!

414
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.034
Television, huh?

415
00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:14.659
How much are you paying
for our inconvenience?


416
00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:17.908
Don't worry, you'll be
compensated for your trouble.


417
00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:20.366
The producer is going to
reach out to you shortly.


418
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.491
She better.

419
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:24.116
Put up with enough
as it is around here.


420
00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:30.324
So... you want a drink?

421
00:20:31.615 --> 00:20:33.699
Yeah, I could have some water.

422
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.615
I can facilitate that.

423
00:20:39.657 --> 00:20:41.574
So, you should have
your contract by tomorrow.


424
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.470
Let me know if you have
any questions.


425
00:20:43.656 --> 00:20:44.906
So I can still back out?

426
00:20:45.864 --> 00:20:46.864
Seriously?

427
00:20:48.031 --> 00:20:51.948
Listen: Christmas means
all the world to me.


428
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:53.364
Obviously, you can see.

429
00:20:53.448 --> 00:20:55.531
And I do this to share it
with others.


430
00:20:56.281 --> 00:20:59.822
But personally. One-on-one.
My way.


431
00:21:00.613 --> 00:21:01.822
What's that supposed to mean?

432
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.030
Maybe I jumped into this
too quickly.


433
00:21:05.238 --> 00:21:06.530
I do that sometimes.

434
00:21:07.613 --> 00:21:10.488
Listen: this is going to
be hectic, inconvenient,


435
00:21:10.572 --> 00:21:12.987
and a total disruption
of your nice, cozy life.


436
00:21:13.779 --> 00:21:15.779
But you won't regret it.
I promise.


437
00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:42.527
Umm... I've gotta go.
I should go.


438
00:21:49.069 --> 00:21:50.069
All right...

439
00:21:51.027 --> 00:21:53.984
I will see you later, I guess.

440
00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:55.318
Looking forward to it.

441
00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:57.359
Okay!

442
00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:06.751
These people haven't given you
much time to get ready,


443
00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:07.608
have they?

444
00:22:07.692 --> 00:22:08.942
I'll never really be ready.

445
00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:10.525
Don't ask me why I'm doing this.

446
00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:12.983
Oh, I know why
you're doing this.


447
00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:14.567
That obvious?

448
00:22:15.317 --> 00:22:18.400
She's beautiful.
And smart, and persuasive.


449
00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:21.732
The way I see it is if I can
help


450
00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.191
promote the charities I
work with,


451
00:22:23.274 --> 00:22:26.024
use the show for good,
then I guess it's worth it.


452
00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:28.816
Maybe it's a good opportunity
to talk about the shelter.


453
00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:31.524
That's a good idea, Hank.
I'll put that on the wish list.


454
00:22:31.607 --> 00:22:32.857
Along with Sophia?

455
00:22:40.023 --> 00:22:41.023
Oww!

456
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:47.356
Oh my gosh, it is perfect.

457
00:22:47.606 --> 00:22:48.606
There he is!

458
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.647
Hi, I'm Paul Rivera.

459
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.814
I'm the executive producer
and creator of the show.


460
00:22:52.897 --> 00:22:53.730
Hi!

461
00:22:53.814 --> 00:22:55.605
AKA my boss, so you've
got to be nice to him.


462
00:22:56.564 --> 00:22:59.397
I absolutely love what
you've done with the place.


463
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.314
It is wonderful.

464
00:23:00.397 --> 00:23:02.938
Our only hope is that
we can do it justice.


465
00:23:03.396 --> 00:23:04.896
And you, too, of course.

466
00:23:06.188 --> 00:23:07.271
Why don't you come with me?

467
00:23:07.354 --> 00:23:09.063
I'm going to give you
a rundown of the day.


468
00:23:09.146 --> 00:23:10.563
Great, we'll see you in a bit.

469
00:23:12.729 --> 00:23:14.771
Nice to see you again,
Miss producer.


470
00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:17.103
It's nice to see you again, too.

471
00:23:18.437 --> 00:23:23.145
Okay, so today is mostly just
going to be shots of the house,


472
00:23:23.228 --> 00:23:27.478
bits and pieces of you
talking and explaining


473
00:23:27.562 --> 00:23:28.978
and we're going to get
a shot of you


474
00:23:29.062 --> 00:23:30.352
greeting us at the front door.

475
00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:31.311
Does that sound good?

476
00:23:31.394 --> 00:23:32.977
Yeah. I guess.

477
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:35.061
As the old saying goes:

478
00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:36.703
if it doesn't work,
we'll just fix it in post.


479
00:23:36.727 --> 00:23:38.019
That's what I'm afraid of.

480
00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:40.352
Don't worry.

481
00:23:43.976 --> 00:23:46.185
I figured you like
to make lists.


482
00:23:46.268 --> 00:23:49.226
Here's mine: these are some
of the charities I work with.


483
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.018
I think it would be good to
put them in the interviews.


484
00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:54.393
Got it.

485
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:55.786
Okay, while they're getting
set up,


486
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.952
let's get you in
hair and makeup.


487
00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:57.976
Makeup?

488
00:23:58.517 --> 00:24:00.142
No, I don't wear makeup.

489
00:24:00.392 --> 00:24:02.142
On camera everyone wears makeup.

490
00:24:02.225 --> 00:24:03.142
Is this our boy, Soph?

491
00:24:03.225 --> 00:24:04.434
Yes Gia, this is Will.

492
00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:06.809
Sit.

493
00:24:08.017 --> 00:24:09.267
Smile. Look pretty.

494
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.267
Which shouldn't be
a problem for you.


495
00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:13.266
Will, look,

496
00:24:13.349 --> 00:24:15.683
I know a lot of guys don't
like the whole makeup idea,


497
00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:17.099
but the point is
to make you look


498
00:24:17.183 --> 00:24:18.367
like you don't
have on makeup on.


499
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:21.058
Let me get this straight,
you want to put makeup on me


500
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:23.974
so I look like I don't
have makeup on me?


501
00:24:24.058 --> 00:24:26.682
That is why they call it
reality TV!


502
00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:27.598
How we doing?

503
00:24:27.682 --> 00:24:29.473
Good! Just getting
golden boy ready.


504
00:24:29.557 --> 00:24:31.307
So, what do you think?

505
00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.473
Dude, or dwarf?

506
00:24:32.557 --> 00:24:33.390
What for?

507
00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:35.432
For Will. To wear
in the opening shot.


508
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:36.756
We never discussed a costume...

509
00:24:36.807 --> 00:24:38.098
Please hold still, Will.

510
00:24:38.182 --> 00:24:39.639
I'm not wearing a costume.

511
00:24:39.722 --> 00:24:42.389
What about the reindeer suit
you wore in that article?


512
00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:43.306
That was a costume.

513
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:45.472
I was playing Rudolph
for the kids, for charity.


514
00:24:45.556 --> 00:24:46.597
One time!

515
00:24:47.097 --> 00:24:49.139
Well, now you'll be playing
Christmas dude.


516
00:24:49.222 --> 00:24:50.222
Or dwarf.

517
00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:51.847
Ta-dah! Adorable.

518
00:24:51.931 --> 00:24:53.221
I don't want to look "adorable."

519
00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:55.221
Okay, honey,
that ship has sailed.


520
00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:57.221
She just means we love
the way you look already.


521
00:24:57.305 --> 00:25:00.471
We do, but the audience
has a certain expectation.


522
00:25:00.555 --> 00:25:02.221
Namely, holiday cheer.

523
00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:04.805
So let's be cheery, shall we?

524
00:25:06.596 --> 00:25:07.970
Take this. Thank you.

525
00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:09.887
Did you know about this?

526
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.054
I had no idea.

527
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.679
Look, you told me that
sometimes you can be impulsive.


528
00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:19.679
So... how about now?

529
00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:28.303
That's the one.

530
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:30.761
Okay, Will.

531
00:25:30.844 --> 00:25:32.303
Sophia is going to call action.

532
00:25:32.386 --> 00:25:34.677
You're going to open the door
and say your first line.


533
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.093
Then you're going to step back,
open the door a little more


534
00:25:37.177 --> 00:25:39.052
like you're inviting us
into your home,


535
00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:40.468
and Aaron is going to do

536
00:25:40.552 --> 00:25:42.510
a beautiful tracking shot
right inside.


537
00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:43.427
Cool?

538
00:25:43.593 --> 00:25:44.510
What's my line?

539
00:25:44.593 --> 00:25:46.093
Oh sorry, it's...

540
00:25:46.968 --> 00:25:49.259
Hi, I'm Will Saunders.

541
00:25:49.342 --> 00:25:51.759
Welcome to my magical
Christmas wonderland!


542
00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.926
Isn't that a little corny?

543
00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:55.634
Christmas is corny.

544
00:25:56.426 --> 00:25:57.301
Not to me.

545
00:25:57.384 --> 00:25:58.693
Why don't we just drop
the "magical"


546
00:25:58.717 --> 00:26:00.259
and stick with the rest?

547
00:26:01.384 --> 00:26:02.384
Okay.

548
00:26:03.758 --> 00:26:04.758
And...

549
00:26:05.758 --> 00:26:06.758
Action!

550
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:09.633
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

551
00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:11.800
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


552
00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:14.841
Cut!

553
00:26:15.383 --> 00:26:16.383
Let's go again, Will.

554
00:26:16.465 --> 00:26:18.215
This time just
a little livelier.


555
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.674
Ready, and... action!

556
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.299
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

557
00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:26.715
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


558
00:26:27.882 --> 00:26:28.882
Again!

559
00:26:29.007 --> 00:26:30.339
Okay that was a lot better,
Will.


560
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:32.423
We're just going to go
one more time. Good work.


561
00:26:32.798 --> 00:26:33.923
And... action!

562
00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:36.923
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

563
00:26:37.006 --> 00:26:39.214
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


564
00:26:39.298 --> 00:26:40.298
Cut!

565
00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:44.048
Okay Will, This is television.

566
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.838
You need to pretend to be happy,
okay?


567
00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:48.630
You're super excited
about your house


568
00:26:48.713 --> 00:26:50.398
and you can't wait to
share it with the world.


569
00:26:50.422 --> 00:26:52.547
But I'm not and
I look ridiculous.


570
00:26:52.797 --> 00:26:54.838
Fake it, Will. It's TV.

571
00:26:55.672 --> 00:26:56.981
How about we get rid
of the shirt?


572
00:26:57.005 --> 00:26:58.005
We love the shirt.

573
00:26:58.337 --> 00:27:00.004
Not all of us love the shirt.

574
00:27:00.087 --> 00:27:03.254
Hugo? Can you please get
his shirt from the green room?


575
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:04.421
- On it!

576
00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:34.294
Okay. Let's try that again.

577
00:27:35.502 --> 00:27:37.794
Ready? And... action!

578
00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:40.126
Hey, I'm Will Saunders

579
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:41.918
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


580
00:27:42.626 --> 00:27:43.709
And cut!

581
00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:45.209
That was perfect, Will!

582
00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:46.501
Really?

583
00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:47.668
Oh yeah.

584
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:49.459
Super.

585
00:27:52.001 --> 00:27:53.917
So Will, first thing's first.

586
00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:55.875
What do you think sets you apart

587
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:58.417
from other Christmas
enthusiasts?


588
00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.833
I don't know, I guess
when it comes to Christmas,


589
00:28:01.917 --> 00:28:03.833
I'm all in. 110%.

590
00:28:05.292 --> 00:28:07.582
You could say 365%.

591
00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:10.666
Very true. But I can't take
all the credit.


592
00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:12.249
I had a lot of help
along the way.


593
00:28:12.332 --> 00:28:14.957
Starting with my grandparents.
My grandma actually...


594
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:17.999
I'm sorry, grandparents?
Will, I'm curious.


595
00:28:18.082 --> 00:28:20.249
You're a young, strapping lad.

596
00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:23.081
You're single, you probably have
a very active dating life,


597
00:28:23.165 --> 00:28:25.790
how do women react when you
bring them back here?


598
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:27.123
Women?

599
00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:32.956
They like it, I guess,
but usually everyone does...


600
00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:38.080
So you could say that this place
is kind of a chick magnet?


601
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:39.705
Chick magnet?

602
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:42.414
Yeah! They come and see
all the Christmas joy


603
00:28:42.497 --> 00:28:44.015
and they're like, "Which way
to the sleigh bed?"


604
00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:45.039
Am I right?

605
00:28:45.372 --> 00:28:47.330
I'm sorry, what kind of
questions are these?


606
00:28:47.414 --> 00:28:48.330
Fun ones!

607
00:28:48.414 --> 00:28:50.704
Will come on, we love hearing
about your grandma


608
00:28:50.788 --> 00:28:52.180
and all that stuff,
yadda, yadda, yadda.


609
00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:53.121
It's great.

610
00:28:53.204 --> 00:28:54.496
But look at you:

611
00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:58.204
you're a fireman meets
GQ model meets superhero.


612
00:28:58.454 --> 00:28:59.913
So, Christmas aside,

613
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.305
the folks are going to want
to hear a little dirt.


614
00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:03.412
I think I need a break.

615
00:29:03.495 --> 00:29:06.287
Yeah, of course.
Everyone take five!


616
00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:08.912
Really?

617
00:29:08.995 --> 00:29:09.995
What?

618
00:29:10.162 --> 00:29:11.953
I thought it was a
legitimate question.


619
00:29:12.037 --> 00:29:13.953
You asked where
the sleigh bed was.


620
00:29:28.202 --> 00:29:30.494
I know that was
kind of weird, but...


621
00:29:30.577 --> 00:29:32.743
Paul was just doing his job.

622
00:29:33.618 --> 00:29:36.618
What are you two like
good cop and bad cop?


623
00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:38.368
What? No!

624
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.743
Wait, I'm the good cop, right?

625
00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:43.368
You tell me.

626
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.075
Look, we had a deal.

627
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:48.534
And it didn't include me
talking about my love life.


628
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.200
He was trying to loosen you up,

629
00:29:52.284 --> 00:29:53.492
in his own way.

630
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.093
I'm sure none of it's going
to end up on the show.


631
00:29:56.117 --> 00:29:58.699
Sophia, this is my life.
It's important to me.


632
00:30:00.074 --> 00:30:02.324
I don't pretend to be perfect,
far from it.


633
00:30:02.408 --> 00:30:05.408
But I try to stand for
a few good things.


634
00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:07.449
And that comes across
loud and clear.


635
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:12.366
Look, just say
what you want to say.


636
00:30:12.448 --> 00:30:13.865
Forget about the questions.

637
00:30:14.282 --> 00:30:15.573
Don't listen to Paul.

638
00:30:15.657 --> 00:30:17.407
It will slide off of him
like Teflon.


639
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.032
Just take a deep breath.

640
00:30:21.823 --> 00:30:23.490
I know this is weird and new.

641
00:30:27.989 --> 00:30:29.531
It sure feels nice.

642
00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:32.072
I meant...

643
00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.572
I know what you meant.

644
00:30:35.156 --> 00:30:36.697
But it still feels nice.

645
00:30:39.781 --> 00:30:41.530
Hey, maybe we could...

646
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.196
donate the leftover lunch food
to the shelter?


647
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.696
I could get Hank to pick it up.

648
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.363
Yeah. I'll have to ask Lindsey,
but I don't see why not.


649
00:30:50.863 --> 00:30:53.863
Thanks, Sophia. 
That'd be great.

650
00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:58.695
All right, are you ready to face
the big bad cameras again?


651
00:30:59.987 --> 00:31:01.529
I only need you
for one more shot.


652
00:31:01.612 --> 00:31:02.612
All right...

653
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:05.237
No one has ever asked
to donate leftovers


654
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.654
to any other place than
their own refrigerator.


655
00:31:07.737 --> 00:31:10.486
This guy is sexy and saintly.

656
00:31:10.861 --> 00:31:12.111
So we can do it then?

657
00:31:12.194 --> 00:31:14.319
To keep our star happy? Sure.

658
00:31:14.569 --> 00:31:16.361
Oh, no! I left him with Paul.

659
00:31:16.611 --> 00:31:18.069
I really hope he's okay.

660
00:31:18.694 --> 00:31:20.944
See? You don't have
to worry about Paul.


661
00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:22.318
One thing I know about Paul:

662
00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:24.527
he knows how to charm
the pants off of anyone.


663
00:31:24.777 --> 00:31:26.527
I have a feeling those
particular pants


664
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.735
are going to be staying on.

665
00:31:27.818 --> 00:31:29.068
Maybe for Paul...

666
00:31:29.735 --> 00:31:30.985
What's that supposed to mean?

667
00:31:31.527 --> 00:31:33.610
I've seen the way
he looks at you.


668
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.026
So what are you going
to do about it, sunshine?


669
00:31:36.942 --> 00:31:38.442
I'm going to get this last shot.

670
00:31:38.526 --> 00:31:41.067
And stay away from all
mistletoe at every cost.


671
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:44.234
Is that a professional decision
or that whole


672
00:31:44.317 --> 00:31:47.526
"all hot dudes are heartbreakers"
thing you got going on?


673
00:31:47.817 --> 00:31:51.816
Sweetie, not every guy you
like is gonna turn into Marco.


674
00:31:52.025 --> 00:31:55.983
It is statistically and
physically impossible!


675
00:31:58.275 --> 00:31:59.941
Thank you, have a good day!

676
00:32:00.358 --> 00:32:01.525
You too, bye!

677
00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.982
All right, let's go!
Up top, Will!


678
00:32:05.399 --> 00:32:06.399
No?

679
00:32:06.732 --> 00:32:08.982
Are you the fist bump type?
I'm good with that.


680
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:15.399
I know there were some hiccups,

681
00:32:15.482 --> 00:32:18.481
but you actually
kind of rocked it.


682
00:32:19.064 --> 00:32:19.898
You're welcome.

683
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:21.356
Is that what I'm
supposed to say?


684
00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:25.273
I saw you chuckling with Paul.
You were making friendly.


685
00:32:25.523 --> 00:32:26.523
That's a good sign.

686
00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:29.648
There are only a few
fleeting pockets of horrible.


687
00:32:30.773 --> 00:32:32.813
Better than I expected.
How's that?


688
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.688
I'm going to give
you some advice.


689
00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:38.909
Have a beer, or six,
and a nice dinner,


690
00:32:39.117 --> 00:32:40.784
and get a good sleep.

691
00:32:42.563 --> 00:32:43.605
Want to join me on that?

692
00:32:45.687 --> 00:32:47.396
Join you for dinner?

693
00:32:51.187 --> 00:32:52.687
Actually, I can't.

694
00:32:54.396 --> 00:32:57.354
As much as I kind of,
really want to.


695
00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:03.603
I'll take "really kind of want
to" for the future.


696
00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:06.936
Good night, Sophia.

697
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.895
Good night, Will.

698
00:33:41.933 --> 00:33:42.933
Hi.

699
00:33:43.433 --> 00:33:45.433
- Will?
- Sophia!


700
00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.725
What are you doing here?

701
00:33:48.808 --> 00:33:50.100
How do you know where I live?

702
00:33:50.183 --> 00:33:52.975
I get nicer greetings
at the DMV.


703
00:33:53.392 --> 00:33:55.474
You told me when we first met.

704
00:33:55.932 --> 00:33:58.141
Can I come in?

705
00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.016
Yeah, sure...

706
00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:03.807
I hope you like irises.

707
00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:07.432
I do! They're beautiful.

708
00:34:07.599 --> 00:34:09.806
From my front lawn.
But flowers all the same.


709
00:34:10.473 --> 00:34:14.473
Very Van Gogh of you.
What are they for?


710
00:34:15.306 --> 00:34:18.223
An apology. For being
such a grouch today.


711
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:19.515
A grouch?

712
00:34:19.598 --> 00:34:20.598
I kinda was...

713
00:34:21.265 --> 00:34:23.972
But I also needed an excuse
to come over here.


714
00:34:24.305 --> 00:34:25.347
Right.

715
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.139
Thinking about the questions
Paul was asking today.


716
00:34:30.305 --> 00:34:32.597
About me being a chick magnet.

717
00:34:33.597 --> 00:34:35.097
And I just wanted
to clarify that


718
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.221
I am not some sort of player.

719
00:34:37.388 --> 00:34:39.471
Thank you... I think.

720
00:34:40.513 --> 00:34:44.054
It felt like Paul was kind of
trying to make me seem like one.


721
00:34:44.138 --> 00:34:45.763
You know, for
television entertainment.


722
00:34:45.846 --> 00:34:47.554
Maybe he just thinks
you're cute.


723
00:34:49.388 --> 00:34:50.637
I like your place.

724
00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:53.970
It's quirky, elegant.

725
00:34:54.887 --> 00:34:57.262
Yeah? Even without gifts
hanging from the ceilings


726
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.262
and mermaid murals on the wall?

727
00:34:59.345 --> 00:35:00.887
I can arrange that.

728
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.345
I know people.

729
00:35:04.177 --> 00:35:05.094
Do you want to sit?

730
00:35:05.177 --> 00:35:06.761
Yeah, just for a minute.

731
00:35:08.427 --> 00:35:10.761
I'm doing this reality TV show

732
00:35:10.844 --> 00:35:13.594
and these people show up
at the crack of dawn, so...


733
00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:15.136
Sounds like it sucks.

734
00:35:15.219 --> 00:35:16.219
Oh, it does...

735
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:18.676
But there's this
hot producer lady


736
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.635
who kind of makes it
all worthwhile.


737
00:35:38.425 --> 00:35:40.967
Stop! I can't.

738
00:35:41.384 --> 00:35:42.467
Okay.

739
00:35:42.884 --> 00:35:45.883
This is really bad.
It's really bad for the show.


740
00:35:46.299 --> 00:35:47.841
And for me professionally.

741
00:35:48.299 --> 00:35:49.299
Okay.

742
00:35:58.758 --> 00:35:59.758
No!

743
00:35:59.798 --> 00:36:01.173
I can't, I can't...

744
00:36:02.048 --> 00:36:03.965
What? You don't like
the way I kiss?


745
00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:06.882
I do. I like the way
you kiss too much.


746
00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:09.382
A lot. Which is why
you need to go.


747
00:36:09.882 --> 00:36:12.132
Thank you for the flowers
and the kiss.


748
00:36:12.215 --> 00:36:13.922
I will see you tomorrow.

749
00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.214
You are one disciplined girl.

750
00:36:16.297 --> 00:36:18.131
You will thank me later.

751
00:36:18.922 --> 00:36:21.214
Thank you. Goodbye, Will.

752
00:36:49.962 --> 00:36:50.962
Hey.

753
00:36:51.254 --> 00:36:52.920
- Hello.
- Hi.


754
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.253
- Morning.
- Yeah.


755
00:37:06.794 --> 00:37:09.502
You sure I don't look silly
sitting in the middle like this?


756
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.710
You look great, I promise.

757
00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:13.793
Okay, ready?

758
00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:18.960
So Will, you've been collecting
this train set your entire life.


759
00:37:19.043 --> 00:37:21.460
At what point did it become
a Christmas village?


760
00:37:22.002 --> 00:37:23.667
When my house became
holiday central,


761
00:37:23.751 --> 00:37:24.751
so did the trains.

762
00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:26.792
It keeps the kid
alive in me, too.


763
00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:27.876
Absolutely.

764
00:37:27.917 --> 00:37:30.417
The kids that come through
on our fundraising tours,


765
00:37:30.501 --> 00:37:32.042
this is their favorite stop.

766
00:37:32.209 --> 00:37:34.209
Fundraising?
Why don't you tell us


767
00:37:34.292 --> 00:37:35.973
a little about the charities
you work with?


768
00:37:36.042 --> 00:37:37.916
Well, the first and key charity
I work with


769
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.333
is at the Union Hope Shelter.

770
00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.777
That's downtown
at Third and Lucas.


771
00:37:40.833 --> 00:37:42.083
Look at him go.

772
00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.500
I guess there is
some personality


773
00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:44.833
attached to those pecs.

774
00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:46.726
Oh, there's definitely more
to Christmas Dude


775
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.125
than meets the eye.

776
00:37:48.208 --> 00:37:50.999
Just takes the right energy
to bring it out of him.


777
00:37:51.082 --> 00:37:52.141
Of course, on the other hand,

778
00:37:52.165 --> 00:37:53.766
we don't want him to
get too comfortable.


779
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.415
Okay, great!

780
00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:57.415
Let's go over here
and get some more stuff.


781
00:37:57.499 --> 00:37:58.499
Okay.

782
00:38:06.998 --> 00:38:08.289
Okay, so...

783
00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:10.706
This room is really theatrical.

784
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:13.539
It's almost "The Little Mermaid"
meets "A Christmas Story."


785
00:38:13.623 --> 00:38:15.873
Yeah, it was
really fun to design.


786
00:38:15.956 --> 00:38:18.663
It's got kind of a
feminine vibe to it


787
00:38:18.747 --> 00:38:20.788
for such a manly man
like yourself.


788
00:38:20.872 --> 00:38:21.913
Wouldn't you say, Will?

789
00:38:23.497 --> 00:38:26.372
Well, I just wanted a little
something for everyone.


790
00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.663
What exactly was
the inspiration?


791
00:38:29.705 --> 00:38:30.705
Truth?

792
00:38:31.622 --> 00:38:32.704
Always.

793
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:38.787
I had this girlfriend,
and she loved mermaids.


794
00:38:38.871 --> 00:38:42.162
I think she thought she
was one in a past life.


795
00:38:42.246 --> 00:38:44.496
So the idea came from her.

796
00:38:45.621 --> 00:38:48.453
Some people think mermaids
are kind of sexy.


797
00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:52.328
Does this double as a fantasy
suite for you sometimes?


798
00:38:54.953 --> 00:38:57.495
Well, any room can feel special

799
00:38:57.578 --> 00:38:59.620
if you're in it with
the right person.


800
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.244
Wouldn't you agree, Paul?

801
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.994
Works for me.

802
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.244
No further questions,
your honor.


803
00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:11.285
You gave it right back
to Paul in there.


804
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:15.409
I got some good advice
from a smart producer I know.


805
00:39:15.868 --> 00:39:17.159
You should listen to her.

806
00:39:18.034 --> 00:39:19.659
So a mermaid girlfriend?

807
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:23.034
It was ages ago...
water under the bridge.


808
00:39:23.243 --> 00:39:25.118
I just wanted to toss
your nosy boss a bone.


809
00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:26.034
Good job.

810
00:39:26.118 --> 00:39:27.868
Come on, I want to
show you something.


811
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:32.325
Okay, so picture
all this stuff covering


812
00:39:32.408 --> 00:39:35.533
the entire front of the
house and you get the idea.


813
00:39:37.492 --> 00:39:39.658
Santa's workshop has
got nothing on you.


814
00:39:39.742 --> 00:39:41.575
Who do you think he calls
for reinforcements?


815
00:39:44.324 --> 00:39:45.574
Hey, I remember this.

816
00:39:45.991 --> 00:39:48.907
This was what you were working
on the day of our walkthrough.


817
00:39:48.991 --> 00:39:52.449
I was. It's a gingerbread house.

818
00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:56.448
My mom and dad bought it for me

819
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:58.990
the Christmas before
they passed away.


820
00:40:00.448 --> 00:40:01.948
Your last year with them?

821
00:40:03.948 --> 00:40:04.948
It was.

822
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:10.197
Anyway, my grandpa and I added

823
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.072
a whole bunch of details
to it over the years.


824
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.655
Maybe we can do something
special with it on camera?


825
00:40:18.905 --> 00:40:20.864
Absolutely we can.

826
00:40:44.987 --> 00:40:46.153
Sophia!

827
00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.570
Wait five minutes
and then come out.


828
00:40:50.653 --> 00:40:52.486
Yoohoo! Soph!

829
00:40:55.652 --> 00:40:57.277
That was... where were you?

830
00:40:57.361 --> 00:40:59.277
Checking out the millions
of Christmas things.


831
00:40:59.361 --> 00:41:00.569
Will had in the garage.

832
00:41:00.652 --> 00:41:02.152
You would not believe
all the things


833
00:41:02.236 --> 00:41:03.444
he has stashed away in there.

834
00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.652
Crazy!

835
00:41:04.736 --> 00:41:06.068
I cannot wait until
we get a shot


836
00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:08.526
of him decorating the
house. It's going to be insane.


837
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.127
I really hope we scheduled
enough time for it.


838
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:11.276
Did we schedule enough time?

839
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.026
Why are you talking so fast?

840
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.860
- Am I?
- Yeah. You are.


841
00:41:15.235 --> 00:41:19.234
It's just this really strong
coffee this morning.


842
00:41:19.317 --> 00:41:21.359
Yeah! No matter how
much sugar I put in it...


843
00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:33.358
In our next hour: this season's
hottest Christmas recipes.


844
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:35.399
You're watching KTLA.

845
00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:42.108
Hey, Fred. Come to lend a hand?

846
00:41:42.191 --> 00:41:43.191
Not on your life.

847
00:41:43.566 --> 00:41:44.983
I better not see
any of these lights


848
00:41:45.066 --> 00:41:46.566
shining before
they're supposed to!


849
00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:47.565
You know what the
injunction says!


850
00:41:47.648 --> 00:41:49.607
The lights will be up, not on.

851
00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.565
It's just for some
quick filming.


852
00:41:52.315 --> 00:41:54.374
And can I give you a little
piece of neighborly advice?


853
00:41:54.398 --> 00:41:56.065
And what might that be?

854
00:41:56.148 --> 00:41:59.523
How about this Christmas,
I don't know.


855
00:41:59.607 --> 00:42:00.897
Enjoy yourself?

856
00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:13.189
I had it made for you
to wear on the show.


857
00:42:13.272 --> 00:42:14.712
Try it on and tell me
what you think.


858
00:42:14.771 --> 00:42:15.771
I love it!

859
00:42:22.563 --> 00:42:23.563
Oh!

860
00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:29.854
How's it look?

861
00:42:29.937 --> 00:42:31.145
Like a million bucks!

862
00:42:31.229 --> 00:42:32.604
I think it's amazing.

863
00:42:32.895 --> 00:42:34.937
Maybe we need to make it
a little tighter?


864
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.104
Put it in the dryer?

865
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:37.770
If you hot wash it,

866
00:42:37.854 --> 00:42:39.854
we can dry it on your abs,
you know what I mean?


867
00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:41.187
How are you today?

868
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.870
- Doing well, how are you?
- Hi, I'm Paul.


869
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.120
- Paul, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.


870
00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:47.353
So, how do you feel about
Will's Christmas extravaganza?


871
00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:49.162
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.


872
00:42:49.186 --> 00:42:51.519
He can decoare my bush anytime.

873
00:42:52.894 --> 00:42:53.978
I can tell you one thing:

874
00:42:54.061 --> 00:42:56.518
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill. No way!


875
00:42:56.935 --> 00:43:00.768
What do you think of Will's
majestic Christmas wonderland?


876
00:43:03.602 --> 00:43:05.102
I hate the whole thing.

877
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.102
Oh, is that everything?

878
00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:09.893
Yeah, that just about covers it.

879
00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:12.142
Great, great. Did we get that?

880
00:43:12.517 --> 00:43:14.642
Great, can we try it
one more time with a smile?


881
00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:15.726
With a smile?

882
00:43:17.142 --> 00:43:19.017
I hate the whole thing.

883
00:43:48.265 --> 00:43:50.515
So, you happy?

884
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.764
Not unhappy.

885
00:43:53.306 --> 00:43:55.139
Definite improvement.
I'll take it.


886
00:43:55.889 --> 00:43:57.306
Are you heading
back to the office?


887
00:43:57.389 --> 00:43:58.431
No. Home.

888
00:43:59.764 --> 00:44:00.764
Wanna stick around?

889
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:03.306
Maybe.

890
00:44:03.389 --> 00:44:04.473
You've gotta eat, right?

891
00:44:04.806 --> 00:44:06.055
You cook, too?

892
00:44:06.472 --> 00:44:07.972
Oh yeah. I cook.

893
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.888
No measuring cups or cookbooks.
I'm impressed.


894
00:44:14.847 --> 00:44:16.930
I just wing it.
Usually works out.


895
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.762
Are you sure I can't help
with anything?


896
00:44:20.054 --> 00:44:21.054
I'm sure.

897
00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:23.012
All right, I'm on dishes then.

898
00:44:24.012 --> 00:44:25.221
Be my guest.

899
00:44:29.679 --> 00:44:32.637
So, other than the
mermaid wannabe,


900
00:44:32.721 --> 00:44:34.970
are there any other serious
relationships in your past?


901
00:44:35.553 --> 00:44:36.803
A few, for sure.

902
00:44:36.886 --> 00:44:38.720
I was actually engaged
in college.


903
00:44:38.803 --> 00:44:41.845
Really? Engaged.
That is serious.


904
00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:45.928
Yeah, but we were young and
it would've been a disaster.


905
00:44:46.053 --> 00:44:47.220
Hit and miss since then,

906
00:44:47.303 --> 00:44:50.094
and lately it's just been
me and Romeo.


907
00:44:51.927 --> 00:44:53.885
What about you? 
Anyone serious?

908
00:44:55.427 --> 00:44:58.760
Yeah, but no one I wanted
to go the distance with.


909
00:44:59.344 --> 00:45:01.260
The last relationship
was a disaster.


910
00:45:01.343 --> 00:45:03.009
He was a cheating mess.

911
00:45:03.843 --> 00:45:09.176
It kind of tainted relationships
and trust for me, so...


912
00:45:10.176 --> 00:45:11.593
Want me to kick his ass?

913
00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:14.343
No, he was not worth the energy.

914
00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:22.842
How did your parents die?

915
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.425
Sorry, was that
way too personal?


916
00:45:26.508 --> 00:45:27.734
You don't have to
answer that question.


917
00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:29.382
No. It's fine.

918
00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:34.382
It was a car accident.
Drunk driver.


919
00:45:35.841 --> 00:45:36.841
Sorry.

920
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:38.841
How old were you?

921
00:45:39.049 --> 00:45:40.049
Eight.

922
00:45:41.174 --> 00:45:42.632
Do you have any siblings?

923
00:45:43.465 --> 00:45:44.465
Just me.

924
00:45:44.756 --> 00:45:45.965
Any other family?

925
00:45:47.006 --> 00:45:48.006
No.

926
00:45:49.756 --> 00:45:50.881
That's sad.

927
00:45:54.673 --> 00:45:56.548
What I've experienced
in my life,


928
00:45:57.005 --> 00:45:59.839
it's all relative to what
you've experienced,


929
00:45:59.922 --> 00:46:01.589
what Hank has experienced.

930
00:46:02.422 --> 00:46:03.773
The kids from the
charities I work with,


931
00:46:03.797 --> 00:46:05.505
what they're experiencing.

932
00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:07.589
We only know what we know,

933
00:46:07.964 --> 00:46:10.214
if we have nothing else
to compare it to.


934
00:46:10.838 --> 00:46:12.963
Yeah, I suppose so.

935
00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.147
My grandparents swooped me up,
moved me in here,


936
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:17.671
and raised me like champs.

937
00:46:18.921 --> 00:46:21.004
I was always loved,
that's for sure.


938
00:46:21.838 --> 00:46:24.254
Even though I was a pretty
challenging teenager.


939
00:46:24.463 --> 00:46:25.753
Challenging how?

940
00:46:25.837 --> 00:46:27.295
Fell in with a bad crowd.

941
00:46:27.503 --> 00:46:28.962
Drugs, booze...

942
00:46:29.045 --> 00:46:29.878
Really?

943
00:46:29.962 --> 00:46:31.045
Oh yeah.

944
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.212
I was a shithead.

945
00:46:34.378 --> 00:46:35.837
I even broke into a house once.

946
00:46:36.295 --> 00:46:38.919
I hit rock bottom when
I was in my late teens.


947
00:46:39.502 --> 00:46:41.169
Grandparents kicked me out.

948
00:46:41.252 --> 00:46:43.377
Went from one
friend's couch to the next.


949
00:46:44.211 --> 00:46:46.086
Spent a few nights
on the street.


950
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:50.627
Long story short: it was
definitely an eye opener.


951
00:46:51.252 --> 00:46:53.168
I was lucky my grandparents
took me back.


952
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:54.251
Yeah.

953
00:46:55.876 --> 00:46:58.876
Worst I ever did was get
a week's detention.


954
00:46:59.376 --> 00:47:01.335
And I swear, it wasn't my fault!

955
00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:02.751
I'm sure it wasn't.

956
00:47:11.042 --> 00:47:13.917
You were lucky to have them -
your grandparents.


957
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.500
I honestly don't know where

958
00:47:15.584 --> 00:47:17.417
I would have ended up
without them.


959
00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:20.791
So I try to help others
the way they helped me.


960
00:47:20.874 --> 00:47:22.291
Pay it forward, you know?

961
00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:25.958
And keeping the meaning
of Christmas alive every day


962
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:27.374
just ties it all together.

963
00:47:28.374 --> 00:47:29.624
That's beautiful, Will.

964
00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:34.123
I wonder what your
grandparents would think


965
00:47:34.207 --> 00:47:36.040
about everything
that's going on here now?


966
00:47:36.123 --> 00:47:37.957
Are you kidding? 
They'd love it.

967
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.457
They were the happiest,
chattiest pair you've ever seen.


968
00:47:42.373 --> 00:47:43.498
How about your parents?

969
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.498
Not the happiest, chattiest
pair you've ever met.


970
00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:49.956
They were divorced when I was
in third grade, so...


971
00:47:52.289 --> 00:47:54.081
Will, I have a confession
to make.


972
00:47:54.664 --> 00:47:56.247
Should I be sitting down?

973
00:47:56.664 --> 00:47:57.872
No, it's just...

974
00:48:00.039 --> 00:48:03.080
I am not cuckoo for Christmas.

975
00:48:03.621 --> 00:48:06.080
I just said it so you
would do the show


976
00:48:06.163 --> 00:48:08.205
and so that you'd like me.

977
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.913
I have something
to confess, too.


978
00:48:12.996 --> 00:48:14.080
I already knew.

979
00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:15.871
Any true Christmas nut

980
00:48:15.912 --> 00:48:17.888
could've immediately named
their favorite ornament maker.


981
00:48:17.912 --> 00:48:19.454
You went generic.

982
00:48:19.537 --> 00:48:20.787
But it's okay, really.

983
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.704
I won't hold it against you.

984
00:48:22.787 --> 00:48:23.870
Well, thank you.

985
00:48:23.954 --> 00:48:26.662
Although I'm not sure
that I deserve that.


986
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.370
My parents.

987
00:48:32.203 --> 00:48:36.161
Every year they would argue over
who got me at Christmas time.


988
00:48:37.703 --> 00:48:39.036
It was a big competition:

989
00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:43.910
who had the bigger house,
better gifts, fancier vacation,


990
00:48:43.993 --> 00:48:46.702
and it made me dread
Christmas every year.


991
00:48:46.785 --> 00:48:48.077
I still do.

992
00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:51.743
Maybe this year
will be different.


993
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.202
Maybe it will.

994
00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:24.649
Who knew he'd look
so good on a ladder?


995
00:51:24.732 --> 00:51:26.373
Wait! We shouldn't
be letting him do that!


996
00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:28.042
Yeah, it's not really
the best time for our star


997
00:51:28.066 --> 00:51:29.274
to end up in a full body cast.

998
00:51:29.357 --> 00:51:31.481
This is going to be gold.
It'll cut together great!


999
00:51:31.565 --> 00:51:34.815
Plus we are insured up
the wazoo, so...


1000
00:51:36.815 --> 00:51:38.273
He's smiley today.

1001
00:51:38.523 --> 00:51:40.773
Maybe our boy got
a little lucky last night.


1002
00:51:40.856 --> 00:51:41.981
Why do you say that?

1003
00:51:42.398 --> 00:51:44.689
That glow, it ain't from
the Christmas lights.


1004
00:51:44.772 --> 00:51:47.439
I'll tell you one thing:
he loves that t-shirt.


1005
00:51:47.522 --> 00:51:49.189
And we love him in it.

1006
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.272
Nice job, Sophia.

1007
00:51:54.814 --> 00:51:56.355
How's that? Did you
get what you want?


1008
00:51:57.689 --> 00:51:58.521
That was scary.

1009
00:51:58.604 --> 00:52:01.563
That was hilarious, and our
cameras caught every second.


1010
00:52:01.646 --> 00:52:03.688
Great job, Will,
that was perfect!


1011
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:05.063
He could've killed himself!

1012
00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:08.938
Sophia, come on! We need a
little excitement, some action.


1013
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:10.271
Yeah, that you can manipulate.

1014
00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:12.312
Don't try this at home, kids.

1015
00:52:12.812 --> 00:52:13.853
Will, let's go again.

1016
00:52:16.312 --> 00:52:18.187
What is it? What is wrong?

1017
00:52:18.603 --> 00:52:19.978
You know what?
I don't trust Paul.


1018
00:52:20.062 --> 00:52:22.187
I understand that we're
making television here,


1019
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:24.103
but there are
real lives at stake.


1020
00:52:24.187 --> 00:52:27.519
Okay, I'm just gonna
take a stab here:


1021
00:52:27.727 --> 00:52:31.811
this isn't about Paul, is it?
It's about you and Will.


1022
00:52:32.727 --> 00:52:34.061
What about me and Will?

1023
00:52:34.477 --> 00:52:35.477
I asked you first.

1024
00:52:37.602 --> 00:52:39.519
Oh my god, you slept with him!

1025
00:52:39.602 --> 00:52:40.602
Shhh!

1026
00:52:40.643 --> 00:52:42.018
Why didn't you say something?

1027
00:52:42.268 --> 00:52:45.101
This is... fantastic!

1028
00:52:45.643 --> 00:52:47.185
When was it? How was it?

1029
00:52:47.268 --> 00:52:49.518
It was last night and
it was off the charts.


1030
00:52:50.018 --> 00:52:52.893
I'm in it really
deep here, Linz.


1031
00:52:52.976 --> 00:52:54.017
Okay yeah, I mean,

1032
00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.017
maybe this isn't the beset
career move for you


1033
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:00.059
at this very second, but you'd
have to be made of cement


1034
00:53:00.142 --> 00:53:01.725
not to respond to Will.

1035
00:53:02.225 --> 00:53:03.809
That doesn't make it right.

1036
00:53:04.684 --> 00:53:07.350
Look, you deserve to be happy.

1037
00:53:07.433 --> 00:53:10.974
Just be careful, don't
let it affect the work.


1038
00:53:11.058 --> 00:53:13.849
And... enjoy the shit out of it.

1039
00:53:15.808 --> 00:53:16.808
Not a peep!

1040
00:53:17.266 --> 00:53:18.349
You got it, sister.

1041
00:53:23.682 --> 00:53:25.140
Give us the countdown, man.

1042
00:53:25.223 --> 00:53:26.973
Three, two, one...

1043
00:53:28.057 --> 00:53:29.348
Merry Christmas!

1044
00:53:54.971 --> 00:53:55.971
Hey!

1045
00:53:56.638 --> 00:53:58.513
Leaving without a goodbye?

1046
00:53:58.971 --> 00:54:00.471
Goodbyes with you
get me in trouble.


1047
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.721
You won't stay?

1048
00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:05.387
I can't stay.

1049
00:54:06.804 --> 00:54:07.804
I understand.

1050
00:54:10.345 --> 00:54:11.929
I was thinking, if you want,

1051
00:54:12.012 --> 00:54:14.213
I could help you pick out a
Christmas tree this weekend.


1052
00:54:15.429 --> 00:54:16.512
Like a date?

1053
00:54:17.469 --> 00:54:18.594
Call it work.

1054
00:54:20.303 --> 00:54:21.303
Alright.

1055
00:54:21.678 --> 00:54:23.570
My grandpa and I used to
go out after Thanksgiving


1056
00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:25.344
and chop down our own tree.

1057
00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:27.070
My biggest thrill was
when I was old enough


1058
00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:28.636
to do the chopping myself.

1059
00:54:28.719 --> 00:54:30.802
Just a boy and his axe.

1060
00:54:30.885 --> 00:54:32.218
Until I discovered girls.

1061
00:54:32.718 --> 00:54:33.718
Lucky us.

1062
00:54:35.302 --> 00:54:37.635
So, how do I know
which one to pick?


1063
00:54:38.052 --> 00:54:39.468
Which looks best to you?

1064
00:54:41.052 --> 00:54:42.510
I kind of like that one.

1065
00:54:43.302 --> 00:54:45.884
Noble fir.
Good, traditional choice.


1066
00:54:46.676 --> 00:54:47.676
How tall?

1067
00:54:50.259 --> 00:54:52.342
About your height's perfect.

1068
00:54:52.926 --> 00:54:54.009
You like the shape?

1069
00:54:54.092 --> 00:54:56.217
Oh, yeah. So symmetrical.

1070
00:54:57.134 --> 00:54:59.258
Okay, now you have
to check the branches


1071
00:54:59.341 --> 00:55:00.776
and make sure they're
soft and pliable


1072
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.383
and not brittle in any way.

1073
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:04.966
There's nothing brittle
about this one.


1074
00:55:12.757 --> 00:55:15.049
Do you always travel
with 100 spare ornaments?


1075
00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:17.299
I just figured,
given your humbug history,


1076
00:55:17.382 --> 00:55:19.383
you'd be a little light
in the ornament department.


1077
00:55:20.007 --> 00:55:21.965
You figured right.
Thank you.


1078
00:55:24.715 --> 00:55:26.339
I grabbed one of my favorites.

1079
00:55:28.339 --> 00:55:29.714
A movie theater!

1080
00:55:29.798 --> 00:55:32.381
This reminds me of
It's a Wonderful Life.


1081
00:55:32.964 --> 00:55:34.298
My favorite Christmas movie.

1082
00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:36.006
So she does like Christmas!

1083
00:55:36.089 --> 00:55:38.464
I never said I didn't
like Christmas.


1084
00:55:38.548 --> 00:55:39.798
Just aspects of it.

1085
00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:42.630
Pick a place of honor
for the movie house.


1086
00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.047
Perfect.

1087
00:55:55.712 --> 00:55:56.712
Come here.

1088
00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.212
I'm falling, Sophia.

1089
00:56:09.795 --> 00:56:11.211
I'm falling for you.

1090
00:56:35.335 --> 00:56:38.209
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


1091
00:56:39.418 --> 00:56:41.709
Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful you are?


1092
00:56:42.793 --> 00:56:45.334
Can't say anyone has told me
I'm beautiful before.


1093
00:56:45.626 --> 00:56:46.626
No.

1094
00:56:50.083 --> 00:56:52.875
Romeo - is Romeo home alone?

1095
00:56:52.958 --> 00:56:54.208
He's with Hank.

1096
00:56:54.292 --> 00:56:57.042
Can I say that I love that
you think about my dog?


1097
00:56:57.125 --> 00:57:01.167
I think about you.
And how lucky I am.


1098
00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:02.792
That you found me?

1099
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.374
Well, technically
Paul found you.


1100
00:57:05.457 --> 00:57:07.707
I just... followed up.

1101
00:57:08.666 --> 00:57:09.749
Remind me to thank him.

1102
00:57:10.791 --> 00:57:12.624
How about after the show airs,
okay?


1103
00:57:12.916 --> 00:57:13.916
Got it.

1104
00:57:15.749 --> 00:57:18.748
Hey, wanna maybe go for a hike
or something this morning?


1105
00:57:18.956 --> 00:57:21.373
I can grab Romeo,
we can hit up Griffith Park?


1106
00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:25.373
I'm still thinking low profile
is the way to go.


1107
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.540
Or we could just stay in...

1108
00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.997
That could definitely have
its definite advantages.


1109
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:39.872
And here we have Frosty,
and his little brother, Norman.


1110
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.164
Frosty is a more appropriate
Christmas name,


1111
00:57:44.247 --> 00:57:47.079
but Norman's
still... he's nice.


1112
00:57:47.538 --> 00:57:49.496
Here you go, hold
these edges down.


1113
00:57:57.204 --> 00:57:59.828
Our man's certainly got
charisma, no question.


1114
00:57:59.912 --> 00:58:01.245
Once we opened him up.

1115
00:58:01.328 --> 00:58:02.578
Or should I say once you did.

1116
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:07.453
Me, you, the crew... teamwork!

1117
00:58:07.787 --> 00:58:08.787
Mmm-hmm.

1118
00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:13.827
We still need some more
drama, conflict.


1119
00:58:14.202 --> 00:58:15.202
Chaos.

1120
00:58:15.244 --> 00:58:16.244
Chaos?

1121
00:58:16.327 --> 00:58:17.608
We have one more day
of shooting.


1122
00:58:17.661 --> 00:58:18.577
See what you can get.

1123
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.911
I don't want it to have
to be manufactured.


1124
00:58:20.994 --> 00:58:23.452
Like this... snow.

1125
00:58:23.952 --> 00:58:26.202
Everything you see here
has a history,


1126
00:58:26.286 --> 00:58:27.493
a meaning, a purpose.

1127
00:58:28.076 --> 00:58:30.117
So how long have you been
collecting all this stuff?


1128
00:58:30.576 --> 00:58:33.076
I'm 33 years old so... 33 years.

1129
00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:34.826
Since you were a baby?

1130
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:36.535
Well, maybe not that far back.

1131
00:58:36.618 --> 00:58:38.701
But my first words were,
"Santa Claus."


1132
00:58:39.951 --> 00:58:41.951
Why don't you tell us about
this gingerbread house?


1133
00:58:42.284 --> 00:58:44.659
My parents gave me this
incredible gingerbread house


1134
00:58:44.742 --> 00:58:46.409
for Christmas when I was a kid.

1135
00:58:46.492 --> 00:58:48.510
I was too young then to know
how to put it together,


1136
00:58:48.534 --> 00:58:50.659
so my dad and grandpa
showed me how.


1137
00:58:51.159 --> 00:58:53.867
And every Christmas since,
I've assembled it.


1138
00:58:54.534 --> 00:58:56.408
Last few years,
Hank has lent me a hand.


1139
00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.533
Push in a little bit.

1140
00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:00.717
Kayla, your boom
is in the shot again.


1141
00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:02.199
- I'm not in the shot!

1142
00:59:02.658 --> 00:59:03.866
I'm looking through the frame!

1143
00:59:03.949 --> 00:59:05.616
Kayla, just back up.

1144
00:59:05.991 --> 00:59:09.073
Well, I can't really back up...

1145
00:59:10.032 --> 00:59:11.532
Kayla, just put your boom up.

1146
00:59:11.615 --> 00:59:13.016
Okay, I guess I'm getting
up then...


1147
00:59:25.406 --> 00:59:27.822
Okay... no worries,
it's all good.


1148
00:59:29.156 --> 00:59:31.197
No one got hurt.
The house can be fixed.


1149
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:32.197
Kayla, are you okay?

1150
00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:35.406
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, the house...


1151
00:59:36.488 --> 00:59:37.488
It's fine.

1152
00:59:41.196 --> 00:59:42.196
Cut.

1153
00:59:54.737 --> 00:59:55.737
Is everything okay?

1154
00:59:56.279 --> 00:59:57.279
Yup.

1155
00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.404
How's the house?

1156
01:00:01.695 --> 01:00:02.695
Getting fixed.

1157
01:00:05.111 --> 01:00:07.986
Kayla feels so bad. We all do.

1158
01:00:08.778 --> 01:00:10.361
If I wouldn't have told her
to back up,


1159
01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:11.986
none of this would
have happened.


1160
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:13.319
I'm so, so sorry.

1161
01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.736
Sorry about what?

1162
01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:17.736
I just told you: your house.

1163
01:00:18.818 --> 01:00:20.693
How about being sorry
you kept rolling?


1164
01:00:22.568 --> 01:00:23.794
Why didn't you stop the filming

1165
01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:25.485
the second you saw
what happened?


1166
01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:33.067
Listen, I gotta fix this.

1167
01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:34.692
I'll see you inside.

1168
01:00:55.316 --> 01:00:56.691
So, do you need a ride home?

1169
01:00:56.775 --> 01:00:58.400
Don't you live in the
opposite direction?


1170
01:00:58.483 --> 01:01:00.399
Yeah, but I can give you
a ride there


1171
01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:01.857
if you need one, obviously.

1172
01:01:02.857 --> 01:01:04.982
I guess I can put up
with you for a little longer.


1173
01:01:09.524 --> 01:01:10.815
He's in the garage.

1174
01:01:10.899 --> 01:01:12.333
I should have stopped
rolling immediately.


1175
01:01:12.357 --> 01:01:13.416
That's not what Paul would say.

1176
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.064
Yeah, well Paul isn't secretly
involved with our lead.


1177
01:01:20.689 --> 01:01:22.523
- Shit.
- What?


1178
01:01:23.773 --> 01:01:24.856
Oh my God.

1179
01:01:27.522 --> 01:01:29.397
That's good,
but that's not good.


1180
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.813
That's bad for the show.

1181
01:01:33.688 --> 01:01:34.956
Who you're with is
really none of his


1182
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.855
or anyone else's business.

1183
01:01:35.938 --> 01:01:37.980
That's just it,
it is his business.


1184
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.230
And it just looks bad.

1185
01:01:42.146 --> 01:01:43.896
I mean, I know it wasn't exactly

1186
01:01:43.979 --> 01:01:46.396
the smartest choice to make,
but...


1187
01:01:48.062 --> 01:01:49.062
I made a choice.

1188
01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:50.896
Are you sorry you did?

1189
01:01:51.812 --> 01:01:52.854
No.

1190
01:01:53.562 --> 01:01:55.311
Are you sorry you decided
to do the show?


1191
01:01:56.436 --> 01:01:57.436
A little.

1192
01:01:58.561 --> 01:02:00.436
But then I wouldn't
have met you...


1193
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.478
Unless of course
we're breaking up?


1194
01:02:04.186 --> 01:02:07.936
No. I'm an excellent
multi-tasker.


1195
01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:09.395
You are.

1196
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.185
But I have a show to produce.

1197
01:02:13.602 --> 01:02:16.894
I have to stay focused,
there is a lot riding on it.


1198
01:02:16.977 --> 01:02:18.435
Like my career.

1199
01:02:19.977 --> 01:02:21.144
Sophia Worthy...

1200
01:02:23.226 --> 01:02:26.018
You are one of the
most determined, capable,


1201
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:28.184
inspiring people
I've ever known.


1202
01:02:29.268 --> 01:02:31.476
You can do it all. I know it.

1203
01:02:32.934 --> 01:02:35.434
That's one of the sweetest
things anyone's ever said to me.


1204
01:02:36.933 --> 01:02:39.017
I knew I liked you for a reason.

1205
01:02:43.767 --> 01:02:46.392
I'm sorry I got so intense
about the gingerbread house.


1206
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:49.433
It meant a lot to you.

1207
01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:52.891
It's a big part of your past.

1208
01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:56.057
Yeah, but it's a decoration.

1209
01:02:57.182 --> 01:02:58.641
You were just doing your job.

1210
01:02:59.307 --> 01:03:00.682
I should have stopped rolling.

1211
01:03:01.432 --> 01:03:03.016
And I knew the history
of the house,


1212
01:03:03.099 --> 01:03:04.141
and if it's broken...

1213
01:03:04.224 --> 01:03:05.224
I'll fix it.

1214
01:03:06.223 --> 01:03:07.390
That's what I do.

1215
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.472
There you are.

1216
01:03:24.555 --> 01:03:26.139
I want you to call
to this person.


1217
01:03:27.347 --> 01:03:28.430
Who's Helena Miller?

1218
01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:29.639
She's a shrink. She's great.

1219
01:03:31.514 --> 01:03:34.179
Paul, I know I've got issues,
but I don't need a shrink.


1220
01:03:34.263 --> 01:03:36.388
Not for you, for the show.

1221
01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:39.179
She's great. I want you
to set up a sitdown with her.


1222
01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:41.584
Get her to talk about Christmas,
how it messes with people,


1223
01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:44.263
gets in their head,
makes them go nuts.


1224
01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:45.947
And by people, I'm
assuming you mean Will?


1225
01:03:45.971 --> 01:03:47.928
Sophia, we still need
more dimension.


1226
01:03:48.345 --> 01:03:49.946
Unless you're scared you're
going to find out something


1227
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.012
you don't want to know.

1228
01:03:53.387 --> 01:03:55.387
I call the holidays
my tax season.


1229
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.470
It's my busiest time.

1230
01:03:56.803 --> 01:03:57.803
Why is that?

1231
01:03:57.887 --> 01:03:58.904
Why do you think the holidays

1232
01:03:58.928 --> 01:04:00.802
are such a difficult time
for people?


1233
01:04:01.052 --> 01:04:05.636
Christmas time is kind of
a perfect emotional storm.


1234
01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:08.552
Another year is gone.
What have I accomplished?


1235
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.177
Who do I have to celebrate with?

1236
01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:12.677
Why does everybody
seem so happy but me?


1237
01:04:13.136 --> 01:04:15.926
And then there are the childhood
triggers that pop up.


1238
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.635
They can really derail you.

1239
01:04:18.385 --> 01:04:19.385
Of course.

1240
01:04:20.676 --> 01:04:22.843
So for example,
say if someone wanted


1241
01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:26.135
to celebrate Christmas
every day of the year.


1242
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.560
What do you think is
the deeper meaning there?


1243
01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:32.300
Two words: disfunction junction.

1244
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.384
Thank you. Done.

1245
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.092
That was great.

1246
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:43.883
Sophia, this is so wrong.

1247
01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:46.716
I know, it wasn't my idea.

1248
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:49.966
How is the show looking so far?

1249
01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:52.133
We have a lot of great footage.

1250
01:04:52.216 --> 01:04:54.383
You are looking like
a major star.


1251
01:04:54.674 --> 01:04:58.382
Everyone loves Christmas,
so what can go wrong?


1252
01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.007
Even I'm getting into it.

1253
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:01.090
Yeah?

1254
01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:06.923
Anything important?

1255
01:05:07.007 --> 01:05:09.465
My buddy CJ saw a promo
for the show.


1256
01:05:09.548 --> 01:05:10.548
He texted it to me.

1257
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:11.839
A promo?

1258
01:05:11.922 --> 01:05:13.589
You're kidding, I
didn't know we had one.


1259
01:05:14.464 --> 01:05:17.297
Wait... maybe I
should watch it first?


1260
01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.714
Why? Are you
afraid of something?


1261
01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:22.631
No, I just...

1262
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.838
Okay fine, let's watch it.

1263
01:05:27.046 --> 01:05:30.213
Buckle up this Christmas as
Bravada Television presents.


1264
01:05:30.296 --> 01:05:34.255
"Extreme Holidays" with an eye-
opening look at one sexy stud


1265
01:05:34.338 --> 01:05:38.170
who celebrates yuletide 365
crazy days a year!"


1266
01:05:39.129 --> 01:05:40.754
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

1267
01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:43.337
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!


1268
01:05:49.004 --> 01:05:50.795
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.


1269
01:05:50.879 --> 01:05:52.759
But my kids love it, so
what're you gonna do?


1270
01:05:52.794 --> 01:05:54.378
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill.


1271
01:05:54.878 --> 01:05:56.253
I hate the whole thing.

1272
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:59.378
Uh...

1273
01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:01.294
It's snowing!

1274
01:06:02.878 --> 01:06:05.960
Two words: disfunction junction.

1275
01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:09.085
You've never seen a guy so
hopelessly devoted in your life!


1276
01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:11.127
Catch the series premier,
Christmas Eve!


1277
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.002
I don't know, maybe I'm nuts...

1278
01:06:13.085 --> 01:06:14.335
Can I do that again?

1279
01:06:16.543 --> 01:06:17.543
What the hell was that?

1280
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.460
So you knew about this?

1281
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.393
Well, I knew they
were cutting promos.


1282
01:06:21.417 --> 01:06:22.560
I didn't know when
they were airing.


1283
01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:23.501
Well, they have to pull it.

1284
01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:24.584
That's not happening.

1285
01:06:24.626 --> 01:06:25.626
It has to!

1286
01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:26.935
Not only does it
misrepresent Will,


1287
01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:28.251
but it misrepresents the show!

1288
01:06:28.334 --> 01:06:30.084
Okay Sophia, calm down!

1289
01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:34.416
The network got ahold of me
late last night.


1290
01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:38.041
The new promos
tested through the roof.


1291
01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:40.666
The network immediately
slapped them online, on air...


1292
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:41.892
But it's not the show
we're making!


1293
01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:43.416
Well I hate to tell you,
but it is.


1294
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.781
At least it's the tone
they want.


1295
01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:45.750
What about what we want?

1296
01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.915
We want our deal renewed.

1297
01:06:49.582 --> 01:06:51.165
What if I disagree?

1298
01:06:51.249 --> 01:06:53.874
Well, you could quit

1299
01:06:53.957 --> 01:06:57.249
and have absolutely no say
in the direction we take.


1300
01:06:57.332 --> 01:07:00.624
Or you can stay and cut
a great show.


1301
01:07:00.706 --> 01:07:02.914
One that Bravada will
really, really love.


1302
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:04.432
So you're letting them
make me look


1303
01:07:04.456 --> 01:07:06.581
like a complete idiot
on national TV.


1304
01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:09.081
The one thing I was
worried about from the start.


1305
01:07:11.539 --> 01:07:13.706
I'm going to be there
every step of the way


1306
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:15.497
and make sure that
the show looks


1307
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.288
as good as it possibly can.

1308
01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.788
Within my power.

1309
01:07:19.872 --> 01:07:21.330
This was such a mistake.

1310
01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.705
I never should have said yes.

1311
01:07:24.705 --> 01:07:26.163
Why did you then?

1312
01:07:28.163 --> 01:07:29.163
The truth?

1313
01:07:30.704 --> 01:07:31.704
Because of you.

1314
01:07:33.787 --> 01:07:36.621
I believed you saw something
in me that maybe I didn't.


1315
01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:39.746
So when you told me
to trust you, I did.


1316
01:07:43.453 --> 01:07:45.078
I also feel kind of used.

1317
01:07:47.536 --> 01:07:50.370
Used? By who?

1318
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:52.745
By Paul. And by you.

1319
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:57.244
I know how you feel 
- I do.

1320
01:07:59.452 --> 01:08:01.077
I was blindsided too.

1321
01:08:05.452 --> 01:08:08.035
I really don't want this
to come between us.


1322
01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:11.368
It already has.

1323
01:08:22.659 --> 01:08:23.659
There you go.

1324
01:08:24.075 --> 01:08:25.783
I knew it was too good
to be true.


1325
01:08:27.367 --> 01:08:29.575
You can't be that
surprised by it.


1326
01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:31.533
I can't?

1327
01:08:32.367 --> 01:08:34.658
He was a little prickly.

1328
01:08:35.492 --> 01:08:36.742
Very much his own man,

1329
01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:39.116
which is not necessarily
a bad thing,


1330
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:41.116
but there were some red flags

1331
01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:43.199
flying amid that
first-rate hunkiness.


1332
01:08:43.282 --> 01:08:44.907
There were? What red flags?

1333
01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:47.741
Well, he's Christmas crazy.
That's unusual.


1334
01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:50.282
He's creative and nostalgic.

1335
01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:52.448
Not crazy, don't call him that.

1336
01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:53.573
You know what I mean.

1337
01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:55.365
I don't know, Linz.

1338
01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:57.240
He's honestly
all-around perfect.


1339
01:08:58.656 --> 01:09:01.656
It's just your judgment got
a little clouded, that's all.


1340
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:04.990
I have never felt this way.
Ever.


1341
01:09:05.947 --> 01:09:08.739
Guys like Will don't
come around every day.


1342
01:09:08.822 --> 01:09:11.530
Good thing, because how could
we keep up with them all?


1343
01:09:14.947 --> 01:09:17.530
Will told me that he thought
that I saw things in him


1344
01:09:17.614 --> 01:09:19.447
that he hadn't seen in himself.

1345
01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:22.904
Honestly, it was
the other way around.


1346
01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:25.613
And I was starting
to love him for it.


1347
01:09:27.404 --> 01:09:28.779
At least I thought I was.

1348
01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.071
Men...

1349
01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.070
Men.

1350
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.775
Set it down over there.

1351
01:10:21.192 --> 01:10:23.067
Still haven't fixed that yet?

1352
01:10:23.692 --> 01:10:24.692
Roof's busted.

1353
01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:28.067
Long as I've known you, Will,
you've never been a quitter.


1354
01:10:29.483 --> 01:10:31.774
Some things are just
broken beyond repair.


1355
01:10:33.399 --> 01:10:35.524
You talking about the house,
or Sophia?


1356
01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.774
What are we if we can't be
trusted to do the right thing?


1357
01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:41.733
People make mistakes, Will.

1358
01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:44.690
It doesn't mean they can't learn
from them, can't change.


1359
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.541
Yvette and I might
still be together


1360
01:10:46.565 --> 01:10:48.648
if I had just made
some different choices.


1361
01:10:49.232 --> 01:10:51.565
I might know my kids,
my grand kids.


1362
01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:53.982
Just don't be like me, Will.

1363
01:10:54.398 --> 01:10:55.523
Don't have regrets.

1364
01:10:58.147 --> 01:11:01.356
Come on - let's fix this old
gingerbread house already.


1365
01:11:06.022 --> 01:11:09.189
You know what?
Just give me a sec.


1366
01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:19.730
Need some help?

1367
01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:23.355
Damn gophers...

1368
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:27.062
One of these days they're going
to eat the whole damn mailbox.


1369
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.520
Maybe you could get an
injunction against them?


1370
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:39.603
Really is quite the deal
you put on there.


1371
01:11:40.686 --> 01:11:42.644
I don't think I quite
realized that


1372
01:11:42.728 --> 01:11:44.394
until that whole TV show
came along.


1373
01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.561
Gotta love those cameras, right?

1374
01:11:48.894 --> 01:11:50.019
I, uh...

1375
01:11:51.228 --> 01:11:52.768
I gave them an interview,
you know.


1376
01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:56.102
I saw. Nice work, very quotable.

1377
01:11:58.643 --> 01:12:01.435
Ginny always talked about
how great it was on the inside.


1378
01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.893
I've been missing her a lot
this last little while.


1379
01:12:09.351 --> 01:12:10.767
Feel like a quick tour?

1380
01:12:11.517 --> 01:12:13.434
Yeah, I'd like that.

1381
01:12:16.059 --> 01:12:17.559
Don't worry, it will stay there.

1382
01:12:19.267 --> 01:12:22.475
I don't always succeed,
but that's what I try to do.


1383
01:12:24.683 --> 01:12:26.183
So, how's it going?

1384
01:12:27.183 --> 01:12:30.308
Good, just trying to decide
what to use from this clip.


1385
01:12:30.766 --> 01:12:34.557
Oh, is this when he waxes poetic
about peace on earth


1386
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.057
and good will hunting,
or whatever?


1387
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.265
Can we please use as little
of this as possible?


1388
01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:43.099
Yeah, it's only his entire
philosophy and reason for being.


1389
01:12:44.349 --> 01:12:46.515
I get it: laughs, gaffes,
and thrills.


1390
01:12:46.599 --> 01:12:47.640
I'm on it, Paul.

1391
01:12:49.306 --> 01:12:52.598
Look, I know I've been
hard on you.


1392
01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:56.598
But it's because I really
want you to succeed.


1393
01:12:57.139 --> 01:13:00.514
You have real ability, and
I want everyone to see it.


1394
01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:02.723
Okay?

1395
01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:08.055
So, you going to bring Superman
to the Christmas party?


1396
01:13:09.222 --> 01:13:10.972
That would be a little hard
right now.


1397
01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:12.597
We're not exactly speaking.

1398
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.180
Oh.

1399
01:13:15.263 --> 01:13:16.554
Is that because of the show?

1400
01:13:17.304 --> 01:13:21.971
The show. Expectations.
Trust issues.


1401
01:13:22.179 --> 01:13:24.887
And don't date the talent:
you were right.


1402
01:13:25.846 --> 01:13:28.721
Well, I had to learn
that one the hard way.


1403
01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:30.970
But then I married the guy,
so...


1404
01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:33.053
It's not always a trainwreck.

1405
01:15:47.502 --> 01:15:48.543
- Sophia...
- Will!


1406
01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:51.126
I was just...

1407
01:15:51.793 --> 01:15:53.043
getting a latte.

1408
01:15:54.251 --> 01:15:57.585
Medium nonfat, half-caf,
no foam...


1409
01:15:59.043 --> 01:16:00.126
teaspoon of agave.

1410
01:16:02.001 --> 01:16:03.084
Good memory.

1411
01:16:04.334 --> 01:16:06.084
- So how've you been?
- How've you been?


1412
01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:08.292
How's Romeo?

1413
01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:11.084
Excited to see you.

1414
01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:12.959
Yeah, I miss him too.

1415
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:20.083
The show is looking really good.

1416
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:25.666
Paul was asking me if you
would do publicity for it,


1417
01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.833
but I assumed it was a fat "no."

1418
01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:30.290
Whatever the opposite
of publicity is,


1419
01:16:30.373 --> 01:16:32.832
that's what I'll be doing.

1420
01:16:38.582 --> 01:16:41.415
I fixed the gingerbread house.
Looks almost good as new.


1421
01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:44.789
That's really good.

1422
01:16:48.872 --> 01:16:49.872
Well...

1423
01:16:57.206 --> 01:16:58.496
Merry Christmas, Sophia.

1424
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.288
You too, Will.

1425
01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:05.621
Bye Romeo.

1426
01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:24.037
Hey.

1427
01:17:24.495 --> 01:17:25.911
I just downloaded some extra
B-roll


1428
01:17:25.994 --> 01:17:27.536
that must have got
lost in the shuffle.


1429
01:17:27.619 --> 01:17:28.494
You should check it out.

1430
01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:29.494
Okay. Thanks, I will.

1431
01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:30.828
File's named "New."

1432
01:17:31.619 --> 01:17:33.078
You know, Will he's like,

1433
01:17:33.161 --> 01:17:35.161
he's this tall, good looking
young man.


1434
01:17:35.244 --> 01:17:38.161
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold.


1435
01:17:38.244 --> 01:17:39.910
And uh, I just love the guy.

1436
01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.118
And uh, I just love the guy.

1437
01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:50.493
It was probably my favorite
Christmas present of all time.


1438
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:51.910
High five!

1439
01:18:02.617 --> 01:18:04.117
Hey, I got your text, what's up?

1440
01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:06.409
Bravada moved up the viewing
meeting. It's in two hours.


1441
01:18:06.492 --> 01:18:08.283
Two hours? No, it's not
for two days!


1442
01:18:08.366 --> 01:18:09.908
Bentley has to
leave town tonight,


1443
01:18:09.991 --> 01:18:11.700
wants to see a cut
in person, with us.


1444
01:18:11.783 --> 01:18:13.259
No, it's nowhere close
to being ready...


1445
01:18:13.283 --> 01:18:14.967
It's not like they haven't
seen footage already.


1446
01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:17.200
They cut promos, remember?
They're expecting rough.


1447
01:18:17.491 --> 01:18:18.408
How rough is it?

1448
01:18:18.491 --> 01:18:19.783
I mean it's long, but watchable.

1449
01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:21.282
Fine, just wrap it up.

1450
01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:22.199
Paul, I've been meaning to...

1451
01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:23.199
I don't have time.

1452
01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.966
I need to crunch numbers with
Lindsey before the meeting.


1453
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:26.074
- Okay.
- Thank you.


1454
01:18:27.032 --> 01:18:30.490
Our goal is to launch with
a subject and a situation


1455
01:18:30.574 --> 01:18:34.407
so unique and strange,
yet relatable,


1456
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:35.988
that it will set the bar

1457
01:18:35.989 --> 01:18:40.031
for an entire year of
extreme holiday madness.


1458
01:18:40.406 --> 01:18:42.090
At the same time, we've
tried to split the difference


1459
01:18:42.114 --> 01:18:44.573
between sentiment
and sensationalism.


1460
01:18:44.656 --> 01:18:46.073
Entertaining, but authentic.

1461
01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:47.317
And I think you'll agree that

1462
01:18:47.364 --> 01:18:50.363
we have found a major star
in Will Saunders.


1463
01:18:50.447 --> 01:18:51.488
Let's see what you've got.

1464
01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.780
Of course.

1465
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.572
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

1466
01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.655
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


1467
01:19:01.238 --> 01:19:03.112
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

1468
01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:05.362
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


1469
01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:07.571
Welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!


1470
01:19:08.279 --> 01:19:09.946
This shirt sucks.

1471
01:19:11.321 --> 01:19:12.904
Hey, I'm Will Saunders

1472
01:19:12.987 --> 01:19:14.737
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.


1473
01:19:15.196 --> 01:19:16.903
You sure I don't look silly?

1474
01:19:17.195 --> 01:19:18.195
I love that.

1475
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.361
How's it look?

1476
01:19:23.445 --> 01:19:24.921
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.


1477
01:19:24.945 --> 01:19:27.278
But my kids love it, so
what're you going to do?


1478
01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:28.861
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill!


1479
01:19:28.945 --> 01:19:30.278
I hate the whole thing.

1480
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:36.902
Will is like this tall,
good looking young man.


1481
01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:41.319
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold


1482
01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.402
and I just love the guy.

1483
01:19:49.193 --> 01:19:51.294
Imagine if we could
keep the spirit of Christmas,


1484
01:19:51.318 --> 01:19:53.401
with all its joy and generosity
and good will


1485
01:19:54.276 --> 01:19:55.484
alive all year round.

1486
01:19:56.193 --> 01:19:58.026
Think how much better off
we'd be?


1487
01:19:59.108 --> 01:20:02.275
I don't always succeed,
but it's what I try to do.


1488
01:20:04.525 --> 01:20:05.525
Wow.

1489
01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:10.442
That really wasn't like the
promos we cut, now was it?


1490
01:20:10.525 --> 01:20:12.899
Jayla, let me explain...

1491
01:20:13.274 --> 01:20:16.399
Actually, Sophia,
why don't you explain?


1492
01:20:16.691 --> 01:20:17.524
Well...

1493
01:20:17.607 --> 01:20:19.024
You know, that won't
be necessary.


1494
01:20:19.691 --> 01:20:22.399
I know what I expected,
I know what I saw,


1495
01:20:22.732 --> 01:20:24.232
and I know how I feel.

1496
01:20:24.316 --> 01:20:25.357
I loved it.

1497
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:28.106
Yeah, those promos
that we cut drew eyeballs,


1498
01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.648
but now it is clear that
we can't have sustain


1499
01:20:30.731 --> 01:20:32.356
that broad of a tone
for a whole show.


1500
01:20:33.356 --> 01:20:36.940
Paul, you and your team found
the sweet spot in the story.


1501
01:20:37.023 --> 01:20:39.398
You made it engaging and vivid,

1502
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:42.272
without sacrificing the charge
of reality TV.


1503
01:20:43.147 --> 01:20:45.814
Heck, you almost kind
of redefined the genre.


1504
01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:47.397
And just in time for Christmas.

1505
01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.647
Well done, people.

1506
01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:49.605
Congratulations.

1507
01:20:49.689 --> 01:20:53.105
We are thrilled that
you enjoyed the...


1508
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:54.479
I've got a plane to catch!

1509
01:20:55.354 --> 01:20:56.354
And Sophia?

1510
01:20:56.688 --> 01:20:58.146
Thank Will for me, would you?

1511
01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:01.813
It is clear that you really
brought out the best in him.


1512
01:21:04.979 --> 01:21:06.604
Well, that was a surprise.

1513
01:21:06.688 --> 01:21:08.312
All the way around.

1514
01:21:08.645 --> 01:21:10.312
I tried to warn you
before we went in...


1515
01:21:10.395 --> 01:21:11.413
It's a good thing you didn't.

1516
01:21:11.437 --> 01:21:12.579
I probably would
have freaked out.


1517
01:21:12.603 --> 01:21:14.353
Actually, I still might.

1518
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.288
I was just trying to do
the right thing for everyone.


1519
01:21:17.312 --> 01:21:18.395
Including you.

1520
01:21:18.478 --> 01:21:19.603
And Will.

1521
01:21:20.103 --> 01:21:21.977
Not really. He doesn't
care anymore.


1522
01:21:22.061 --> 01:21:23.727
You know what? His loss.

1523
01:21:24.477 --> 01:21:26.186
Anyway, once we get
picture lock,


1524
01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:28.101
we have to jump
on Valentine's Day.


1525
01:21:28.102 --> 01:21:30.811
Now, I have got a couple
of romance freaks,


1526
01:21:30.894 --> 01:21:32.977
but I want to know
what you think.


1527
01:21:34.477 --> 01:21:35.477
I think...

1528
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:37.185
I quit.

1529
01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:38.351
Great, quit what?

1530
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.060
My job.

1531
01:21:41.435 --> 01:21:42.560
Excuse me?

1532
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.018
I realized in there that this
isn't the place for me.


1533
01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.062
I don't want to sneak around
behind my boss's back


1534
01:21:48.101 --> 01:21:49.600
to do what I think is right.

1535
01:21:49.684 --> 01:21:50.850
What are you talking about?

1536
01:21:51.517 --> 01:21:53.684
I somehow thought
that I could take


1537
01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:56.684
my love of documentary film
and bring it to reality TV.


1538
01:21:56.767 --> 01:21:58.267
And that was very wrong.

1539
01:21:58.809 --> 01:22:00.684
What happened in there
was a one-off.


1540
01:22:00.767 --> 01:22:02.142
I got lucky, and I know that.

1541
01:22:02.225 --> 01:22:04.105
We're going to go right back
to chasing ratings.


1542
01:22:04.141 --> 01:22:07.224
Which is fine for some people,
just not for me.


1543
01:22:08.016 --> 01:22:09.974
I'm sorry, did Will
put you up to this?


1544
01:22:10.891 --> 01:22:12.766
Hardly. If anything, it was you.

1545
01:22:13.391 --> 01:22:15.391
You're a sharp,
talented guy, Paul.


1546
01:22:15.474 --> 01:22:18.640
But your eye is on the prize,
not the passion.


1547
01:22:19.473 --> 01:22:22.765
Don't worry, I'm going to help
you deliver the show on Friday.


1548
01:22:22.973 --> 01:22:25.515
And if you're thinking about
replacing me, consider Lindsey.


1549
01:22:25.848 --> 01:22:26.848
She's the best.

1550
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.098
Merry Christmas, Paul.

1551
01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:33.889
What does Christmas
have to do with it?


1552
01:23:40.385 --> 01:23:42.009
Dear Will,

1553
01:23:42.092 --> 01:23:44.217
I hate the idea that
your last thoughts of me


1554
01:23:44.301 --> 01:23:45.967
are such disappointing ones.

1555
01:23:47.051 --> 01:23:49.009
As I got to know the man
you truly are,


1556
01:23:49.426 --> 01:23:52.759
my respect and my feeling
for you grew and took shape


1557
01:23:52.842 --> 01:23:55.466
in ways that, honestly,
surprised me.


1558
01:23:57.216 --> 01:23:59.800
Now my greatest wish
is that I can be a person


1559
01:23:59.883 --> 01:24:01.633
you'd respect
with equal measure.


1560
01:24:03.175 --> 01:24:05.800
Even if I never see you again,
I want to be a woman


1561
01:24:05.883 --> 01:24:08.507
who deserves an amazing man
like you.


1562
01:24:09.049 --> 01:24:12.340
Thank you for being that man.
Love, Sophia.


1563
01:24:20.674 --> 01:24:22.881
Welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!


1564
01:24:23.839 --> 01:24:25.548
This shirt sucks.

1565
01:24:26.339 --> 01:24:28.089
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill!


1566
01:24:28.756 --> 01:24:30.464
I hate the whole thing.

1567
01:24:31.548 --> 01:24:35.464
Will is like this tall,
good looking young man.


1568
01:24:36.131 --> 01:24:39.130
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold.


1569
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.130
I just love the guy.

1570
01:24:45.797 --> 01:24:46.797
Hi.

1571
01:24:47.838 --> 01:24:50.504
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd drop by.


1572
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.462
With irises?

1573
01:24:56.379 --> 01:24:57.379
Yup.

1574
01:25:06.336 --> 01:25:08.586
So, did you watch the show?

1575
01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.003
I did.

1576
01:25:11.086 --> 01:25:12.128
And?

1577
01:25:12.461 --> 01:25:14.045
It wasn't half as bad
as I expected.


1578
01:25:14.128 --> 01:25:16.795
Oh, hold off on the praise,
okay?


1579
01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.085
I'm saying I got what
you were going for.


1580
01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.502
You tried to keep it real,
make me seem okay,


1581
01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:24.466
but give the audience enough
of that dopey stuff


1582
01:25:24.502 --> 01:25:25.919
they'd need to keep watching.

1583
01:25:28.335 --> 01:25:30.210
And I know it wasn't what
you were told to do,


1584
01:25:30.294 --> 01:25:32.084
but you did it anyway.

1585
01:25:33.959 --> 01:25:35.668
I know you did that for me.

1586
01:25:36.126 --> 01:25:40.709
I didn't do it for you,
I did it because of you.


1587
01:25:42.043 --> 01:25:43.884
Because of who you showed
the cameras you were.


1588
01:25:44.876 --> 01:25:46.750
I didn't go to film school
for nothing!


1589
01:25:47.167 --> 01:25:48.500
And you didn't get in trouble?

1590
01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:50.458
The network flipped over it.

1591
01:25:50.542 --> 01:25:52.542
Paul folded like a deck chair.

1592
01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:54.958
They're already onto
Valentine's Day.


1593
01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:58.167
So that must make you
Super Real's new golden girl.


1594
01:25:58.583 --> 01:25:59.749
Oh, it totally did.

1595
01:26:00.749 --> 01:26:02.291
I'm happy for you, Sophia.

1596
01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:07.624
But I quit.

1597
01:26:08.499 --> 01:26:09.624
You quit?

1598
01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.291
What do you mean, you quit?

1599
01:26:12.374 --> 01:26:15.081
I want to get excited
about what I do.


1600
01:26:16.248 --> 01:26:18.915
I want solve problems with
my art, not make them.


1601
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:22.351
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?


1602
01:26:23.165 --> 01:26:25.373
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1603
01:26:27.497 --> 01:26:29.205
But I am sure about one thing.

1604
01:26:29.664 --> 01:26:32.205
Oh yeah? What's that?

1605
01:26:33.747 --> 01:26:35.164
That I really miss you.

1606
01:26:36.664 --> 01:26:38.539
And I hope you know that,
no matter what,


1607
01:26:38.622 --> 01:26:40.039
you can trust me again.

1608
01:26:43.204 --> 01:26:44.204
I do.

1609
01:26:46.121 --> 01:26:48.038
I understand now what
you were up against,


1610
01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:50.579
how much was truly
out of your control.


1611
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:55.328
What happened wasn't
intentional, or personal.


1612
01:26:56.828 --> 01:26:58.203
Until it was personal.

1613
01:26:59.537 --> 01:27:01.328
Yeah, I think I remember those.

1614
01:27:02.662 --> 01:27:04.328
They were pretty good,
weren't they?


1615
01:27:05.203 --> 01:27:06.370
They were okay.

1616
01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:07.537
Only okay?

1617
01:27:10.369 --> 01:27:11.661
What are you thinking?

1618
01:27:12.702 --> 01:27:14.202
I'm thinking...

1619
01:27:14.952 --> 01:27:17.202
About you, and me.

1620
01:27:17.994 --> 01:27:20.161
Without all that noise
from the show between us.


1621
01:27:21.327 --> 01:27:22.869
I like that thought.

1622
01:27:25.285 --> 01:27:28.743
If you'll have me, Sophia,
I'm yours.
