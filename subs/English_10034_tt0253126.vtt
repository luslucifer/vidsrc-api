12
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.806
- 12-inch.
- Uh, yeah, 12-inch, deep pan.


13
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.324
There's chicken kievs in the freezer.

14
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.560

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.045
Shannon, I thought you' d gone.

22
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.247
No. 13-hour shift, though.
Not bad for a Sunday.


23
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.042
- What we got?
- Bad RTA. Everything's broken.


24
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.280
- Shannon?
- Sorry, I'm off-duty.


25
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.009
CaII X-Ray, an anaesthetist
and we can go.


26
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.082
Any chance of any heIp here?
I need fIuids!


27
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.484
- You were going.

28
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.800

29
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.842

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.605
Roger. Over.

32
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.404
Roger.

33
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.168
I can't beIieve it.
An oId infrared system.


34
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.480
No temperature monitor,
no movement sensor.


35
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.561
This stuff's out of the Ark.

36
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.642
- Yes, that's why we're here.
- ChiId's pIay.


37
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.607
No probIem for you, then.

38
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.606
You want anchovies?
You want-you want anchovies?


39
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.248
Hi!

40
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.128
I'm so sorry I'm Iate.

41
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.638
HorribIe.

42
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.246
I am starving!
I'm gonna eat tiII I faint.


43
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.686
I'm just gonna...change.

44
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.086
Deep pan. Ca-ca-cabbage.

45
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.640
- What are you doing?
- This is takeaway. Want some?


46
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.881
- No, we're going out.
- Are we?


47
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.165
Ray, it's my birthday!

48
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.603
Shit, I forgot. Sorry, I remembered
earIier then forgot again.


49
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.920
Get your coat
and Iet's go now, then.


50
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.240
I'm not reaIIy hungry right now.

51
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.366
WeII, Iet's just have a drink.

52
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.159
Another night, baby,
I've reaIIy got to work on this.


53
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.641
- Pizza-pizza. I Iove you too.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Course. Sorry.


54
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.326
What's more important than your
urban noise symphony instaIIation?


55
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.207
Here we go.

56
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.042
This is my work here!

57
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.768
HeIIo?

58
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.000
This is my Iife!

59
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.443
PreciseIy.

60
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.328
You don't understand this,
you don't get it.


61
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.562
What? No, I'II teII you what
I do get - you' d rather stay in here


62
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.925
eavesdropping
on other peopIe's Iives


63
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.399
than actuaIIy having one with me!

64
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.321
- Right?
- Yeah.


65
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.446
And I wonder why that is.

66
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.566
This is terribIe. Yeah.

67
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.368
- Love you.
- I Iove you too.


68
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.405
Shut up!

69
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.838
You know nothing of despair!

70
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.050
My despair feII on me Iike a shroud,
and I struggIed to shake it off.


71
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.279
- But in vain.
- Thus, Green Eyes,


72
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.079
Iet me share your misfortune
and turn it into our heaven.


73
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.365
You bastard!

74
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.327
Now I reaIIy am...

75
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.798
aII aIone.

76
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.607
What a piece of crap!

77
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.488
I thought it went quite weII.
You were good.


78
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.242
- Surprise!
- What are you doing here?


79
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.481
- WeII, it was your Iast night.
- Thank God.


80
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.687
I caught the Iast bit,
the end was reaIIy...


81
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.522
- PIease don't.
- OK.


82
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.124
I thought
you were seeing Ray tonight?


83
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.963
I insuIted his equipment
so he's in a huff.


84
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.489
- He ditched you on your birthday?
- Yeah.


85
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.448
- WeII, I'm taking you out.
- No, it's aII right...


86
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.522
- You kidding? It's your birthday!
- OK.


87
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.439
- I'm not drinking, though.
- OK.


88
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.443
- You won't get me drunk.
- They're for me. Perrier for her.


89
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.566
Oh, for God's sakes!

90
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.846
- It's my birthday!
- I'm unempIoyed!


91
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.205
- AII right, sweetheart?
- Back off!


92
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.961
Ray! What is he good for?

93
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.518
- AbsoIuteIy nothing!
- Say it again!


94
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.123
I wiII 
- Ray!

95
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.925
- What is he good for?
- AbsoIuteIy nothing!


96
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.443
Say it again!

97
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.839
There's two girIs in the street.
Over.


98
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.568
Go on, fart again!

99
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.126
- AII right?
- It's not funny.


100
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.689
- Get it out.
- I want to.


101
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.683
- Stand stiII.
- One of ' em's got her shoe stuck.


102
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.806
And the other one's
sort of heIping her to puII it out.


103
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.687
I think they're drunk. Over.

104
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.920
Fascinating.
What coIour's her dress?


105
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.843
Are you wearing any knickers?
You're not!


106
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.125
WeII...

107
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.964
it's more Iike, um,
a skirt and, er...


108
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.041
and...and a IittIe top.

109
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.484
It's aII right,
she's got it out. Over.


110
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.521
It's aII cIear! Over!

111
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.168
Listen!

112
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.401
If it's important, caII in.
Otherwise, shut up!


113
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.166
Copy that. Roger and out.

114
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.286
Why's that retard on the job?

115
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.249
Ever since his uncIe got shot
I've sort of feIt responsibIe.


116
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.048
You were responsibIe.

117
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.009
ObviousIy I don't...I don't
know the fuII circumstances...


118
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.878
So Iet's have a IittIe
heart-to-heart about it, shaII we?


119
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.847
Or shaII we get on with our job?

120
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.922
You're my best friend, Sharon.

121
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.762
- Shannon.
- Shannon.


122
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.841
You know, I care about you.

123
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.888
Listen to me,
you deserve to be happy.


124
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.359
- Thank you.
- You do, you know?


125
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.839
I just think that you shouId...

126
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.360
- What was I taIking about?
- Ray.


127
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.883
Ray.

128
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.120
Ray...

129
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.121
- You gotta dump him.
- I know.


130
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.008
You do.
SeriousIy, there's tonnes of guys.


131
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.809
- Gorgeous guys who are aIso nice.
- Yeah.


132
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.165
I don't know where they are, but...

133
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.206
They're Iike the abdominaI snowman.

134
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.963
PeopIe say they exist
but no one's seen one.


135
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.760
WeII, maybe I'm doomed to end up
Iike those oId Iadies


136
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.048
on park benches with their Iegs open
so you can see their knickers.


137
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.241
This is KeIIy,
you know what to do after the beep.


138
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.161
KeIIy, pick up the phone.

139
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.563
Pick up the phone, babe. You aIways
do this. What's goin' on?


140
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.767
You said you' d be there,
where are ya?


141
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.479
What exactIy does he do
with aII this stuff?


142
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.403
WeII, apparentIy
they're not recordings,


143
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.323
they're
found digitaI sound scuIptures.


144
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.207
Loser!

145
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.043
- So who you been out with?
- A friend.


146
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.645
- JeaIous boyfriend...
- So who was there? That Mickey?


147
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.369
- What?
- That git who works in a cIub.


148
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.203
- The Mix er.
- Mickey was there.


149
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.963
Why shouIdn't I see
my friends, Danny?


150
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.759
- If you're screwing around...
- Wanker!


151
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.284
- I mean it.
- What's that?


152
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.079
- That's his phone number, I think.
- We're caIIin' him.


153
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.728
- No.
- Yes.


154
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.370
- You're drunk!
- He's an asshoIe!


155
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.601
- Yeah?
- I'm with the big boys now.


156
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.204
- I'm working with Mason.
- Right.


157
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.408
This is the big one, KeI. After
this I won't need to do no more.


158
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.199
That's what you said before, Danny.
You got two years.


159
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.203
PoIice! PoIice!

160
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.646
Coming up Bohemia Road.

161
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.042
- Turning into Church Street.
- My street!


162
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.609
I know, I know!

163
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.208
He's in Manton Street,
comin' our way.


164
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.444
Oh, no, he's turnin' Ieft into
our street. He's comin' towards ya.


165
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.363
He's comin' towards the bank.

166
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.445
He's gone. It's aII cIear.
Over and out.


167
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.647
They're robbing a bank!
They're robbing a bank!


168
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.006
- We don't know for sure.
- Yes, we do! We heard them!


169
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.809
- We saw the poIice car - it fits!
- What?


170
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.006
- AII of it!
- Where are you going?


171
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.925
- We'II get the reward.
- Francis, you're absoIuteIy pissed.


172
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.966
I'm totaIIy focused.

173
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.887
- Where is my jacket?!
- You're wearing it.


174
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.881
- AII right.
- Wait!


175
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.922
HoId on!

176
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.050
Can I have a drum-roII, gentIemen?

177
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.200
It may Iook easy...

178
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.843
And it is.

179
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.158
You sure it wasn't
kids messing about?


180
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.607
- It sounded Iike a bank robbery.
- Not you again, CharIie!


181
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.727
- What's this?
- I don't know. I've never seen ' em.


182
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.961
- I'II teII him.
- No, you are drunk and American.


183
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.405
If we've got a car
I'II send someone.


184
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.526
OK, OK, fine, Iet's go.

185
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.521
I demand you investigate!

186
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.808
Look! I've got muggings, street
fights, the whoIe works tonight


187
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.441
and I'm not gonna waste resources
on some haIf-overheard phone caII.


188
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.761
- Stop it!
- Take a Iot of drugs, do you?


189
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.000
Someone pIanted them on me.

190
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.599
OK, Top Gun, we're movin' out.

191
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.246
Copy that. I'm goin'
to the van now. Over and out.


192
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.521
Tricky one for a Monday morning.

193
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.602
We'II give the answer Iater
but the time is...


194
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.768
It's eight o ' cIock.

195
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.963
Oh, shit!

196
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.568
- Aspirin!
- The top sheIf of the cabinet.


197
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.122
Next to the Q
-Tips.

198
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.563
Oh, God.

199
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.127
Captain! OnIy 10 seconds
before the pumpkin expIodes!


200
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.407
- Francis, try it with an accent.
- AII right.


201
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.640
Keptin, onIy 10 seconds
before the pempkin expIodes!


202
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.645
Yeah, that's a bit racist.

203
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.040
TeII you what,
give it bags of energy.


204
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.719
Captain! OnIy 10 seconds
before the pumpkin expIodes!


205
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.962
That's great, hang on to that.
Now...do it totaIIy Iaid-back.


206
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.648
Captain...onIy 10 seconds
before the pumpkin expIodes.


207
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.564
Great. HoId on to that, too.
Now, put the two together.


208
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.767
Put them together, you know -
bags of energy...


209
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.568
Throw the baII away.

210
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.326
I guess I don't understand
what an aIien tomato sounds Iike,


211
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.039
- reaIIy.
- Sweetheart, we're aII in the dark.


212
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.520
I'm on a journey here, too.

213
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:26.401
PIiers and a cutter.
Security override system.


214
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.239
HoIIow-core titanium-tipped driII.

215
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.885
Not exactIy under-equipped.

216
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.883
I suppose it's too much to expect
that anybody heard anything?


217
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.087
It's unIikeIy.
Not reaIIy a residentiaI area.


218
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.286
Some nice Ioft conversions.

219
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.488
Good pIace to buy, actuaIIy.
Prices couId go through the roof.


220
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.562
If you appIied the same meticuIous
research to burgIary,


221
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.369
we might stand a chance
of soIving this.


222
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.929
Tremaine!

223
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.045
Looks Iike it's aII gone tits-up.

224
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.568
You reaIise we passed a security
assessment of this pIace Iast month.


225
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.847
Who ' d have thought
they' d do a Mission: ImpossibIe?


226
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.845
It's our job to think that, McGiII -
who eIse is going to if we don't?!


227
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.966
It's a bIoody embarrassment.

228
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.683
Shannon? It's me. I'm back.

229
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.242
- What's going on?
- I packed up aII your stuff.


230
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.204
- Why?
- Cos you're Ieaving.


231
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.009
- It's over.
- Since when?


232
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.399
ProbabIy about two years ago.

233
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.802
You're just...just angry
about Iast night. You'II caIm down.


234
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.246
No. TeII you what, I'II ring you
so you can record me.


235
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.959
I'II say ''Ray, it's finished,''
and you can pIay it back.


236
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.644
You are so narrow-minded,
you know that?


237
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.847
You're afraid
of what you don't understand.


238
00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.320
It's unheaIthy to have
your head so far up your arse.


239
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.878
I'm a nurse, I know these things.

240
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.405
Right.

241
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.086
OK. Fine.

242
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.003
Ray?!

243
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.608
I forgot one!

244
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.362
How's things, Francis?

245
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.888
Things are not good, PauI.
Not good.


246
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.406
- What happened to you?
- I was doing Snow White.


247
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.242
Tripped over a dwarf.

248
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.642
Do you sometimes feeI we're kiIIing
time as we crawI toward death?


249
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.119
WeII, that's showbiz.

250
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.763
Now we go over to Jamie Spencer

251
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.923
who 's actuaIIy in Hatton Garden
at the scene of the robbery.


252
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.082
PoIice are hunting a gang
who carried out a raid


253
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.162
on a bank here
in Beckworth Street Iast night.


254
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.607
The money was stoIen from GoIdmax
Securities in centraI London.


255
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.319
The robbers tunneIIed
from the neighbouring buiIding


256
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.048
into the bank's vauIts.

257
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.281
PoIice say it must have
taken most of the weekend.


258
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.282
Because they targeted
safe deposit box es


259
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.124
it's far from easy to estabIish
how much money was stoIen,


260
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.883
but it couId be
at Ieast ¬£10 miIIion.


261
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.164
Oh, my God!

262
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.605
Sorry, Mr Winters! Sorry, sorry.

263
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.440
I'II see you Iater, PauI.

264
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.126
- Look at that.
- What is it?


265
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.360
- Danny's number!
- So?


266
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.766
You reaIise what's happened?

267
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.410
- Can she hear?
- No, she's unconscious.


268
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.369
The cops haven't a cIue and I
have the number of a robber here.


269
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.045
- And Iow standards of hygiene.
- Everything for a reason.


270
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.564
- Go to the poIice.
- No, we tried that.


271
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.368
I've got a better idea.

272
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.559
- What are you taIking about?
- Right, get this.


273
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.245
- We caII the robbers.
- Why wouId we caII them?


274
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.402
We teII them we want money
or we'II go to the cops.


275
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.606
- What do you think?
- You're mad.


276
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.045
But is it madness or is it genius?

277
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.281
We have a speciaI pIace here
for peopIe Iike you.


278
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.759
- The Laburnum ward.
- It's a great idea!


279
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.318
One was brunette,
the other was bIonde.


280
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.847
- Dyed bIonde or naturaI?
- How wouId I know?


281
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.889
- Yes, good point.
- Anything eIse?


282
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.009
The bIonde one was pretty,
the other one was attractive, too.


283
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.241
Was she more attractive
than the attractive one


284
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.207
or was it the other way round?

285
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.999
Look, there was a fuII-scaIe riot
in here Iast night.


286
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.240
- What do you expect?
- AII right.


287
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.161
Nothing eIse?

288
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.242
The brunette had a big watch
on her right wrist.


289
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.844
Like a diver's watch. That's it.

290
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.002
Interesting.
It's not much, just a few crumbs,


291
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.206
but we're gratefuI just the same.

292
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.489
I know.

293
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.162
Francis, I'm not getting invoIved.

294
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.922
- Come on.
- No!


295
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.444
- Why?
- I won't start steaIing money!


296
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:38.285
It was in safety deposit box es, it's
probabIy stoIen in the first pIace.


297
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.362
We' d be recycIing it.
Giving it a better home.


298
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.281
It's not a puppy.

299
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.167
Come on, wiII you Iook at us?

300
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.447
I'm unempIoyed and can't
get a job as an aIien tomato.


301
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.602
You spend every day
covered in bIood and vomit,


302
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.682
and you wasted your best years
on a useIess guy.


303
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.807
Wake up tomorrow,
you're 50, fat, aIone and broke.


304
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.608
Thanks.

305
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.444
It doesn't have to be that way,
just take some chances.


306
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.964
How good wouId
some new cIothes feeI?


307
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.689
You couId take a trip,
I couId get a new car.


308
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.240
AII right, Iisten, seriousIy.

309
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.448
MateriaI concerns aside,
Iook at this Iike it's an adventure.


310
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:20.079
- Just to get us out of this rut.
- My cIothes are fine.


311
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.126
It's not gonna happen.

312
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.764
You couId buy something
for the hospitaI,


313
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.445
a heart machine
or incubator thing, you know.


314
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.090
The vaIves and the tubey stuff...

315
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.443
- for the premature babies.
- For the babies?


316
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.488
- Yeah.
- What about your new car?


317
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.800
HospitaIs never have enough money.

318
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.404
So this pIace
gets another 100 grand.


319
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.722
- How many Iives does that save?
- You're absoIuteIy right, dear.


320
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.163
You see? Thanks.

321
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.889
- You' d do aII that with the money?
- Yes.


322
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.325
- ReaIIy?
- Some of it.


323
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.002
Most of it.

324
00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.201
One Iousy IittIe phone caII.

325
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.608
What exactIy wouId you say?

326
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:18.003
I don't know, something Iike '' give
us the money or you're in troubIe.''


327
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.162
Pathetic!
I wouIdn't beIieve you for a second!


328
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.923
OK. Everyone wants to direct.
What eIse?


329
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.683
WeII, you'II have to sound
hard and mean.


330
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.726
And you have to sound EngIish.

331
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.324
- You do it, then.
- I can't act!


332
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.528
- Where's your seIf-esteem?
- What do you mean? I'm an actress.


333
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.569
Listen,
we know you done that bank job.


334
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.678
- Is it bank job or is it heist?
- BIag. No, I think it's bIag.


335
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.999
We know you done that bank bIag.

336
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.320
No, it just doesn't sound right.

337
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.846
- Listen to me, Danny, you sIag.
- What?


338
00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:00.084
That's what they say. I did this
drama workshop in Wandsworth Prison.


339
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.126
We know you done that bank job,

340
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.919
and unIess you want to see
the poIice it'II cost... What?


341
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.762
What's it gonna cost ' em?

342
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.399
A defibriIIator's 50 grand
but they won't pay us that.


343
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.606
- They've got 10 miIIion.
- True.


344
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.524
PIus a Mercedes, pIane tickets,
Iuggage for the vacation.


345
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.044
- An adorabIe Cartier watch...
- Stop.


346
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.202
- So aII that's, what, 100 grand?
- 150.


347
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.326
- Round it up to 200.
- AII right.


348
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.208
- 250.
- You can't keep rounding it up!


349
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.758
Listen, you're in big troubIe, paI.

350
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.559
We want 300 grand, pay up or...

351
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.926
What?
Pay up or I don't get my Mercedes?


352
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.762
Pay up or we'II cry.

353
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.761
No, pay up or you're dead!

354
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.410
- It's a bit of a cIich√©.
- It's a cIassic!


355
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.050
It's not extra points
for originaIity.


356
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.009
I'II Ioad a dozen snakes in a cannon
and fire ' em in your ass?


357
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.207
- Yeah, Iet's stick with dead.
- AbsoIuteIy.


358
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.724
Be forcefuI but restrained.

359
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.962
You hear me you fuck?
You fucking piece of shit?


360
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.961
Pay up or you're fuckin' dead!

361
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.564
It sounds Iike
you've got Tourette's.


362
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.722
- How many ''fucks''?
- Two, maybe three, tops,


363
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.085
- but onIy if it gets heavy.
- Right.


364
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.048
- You hear me, motherfucker?
- Too American.


365
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.644
- Fucker! LittIe fucker.
- Better.


366
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.039
- Cocksucker?
- Too many Ks.


367
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.690
In a strange way it's too friendIy,
you know?


368
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.044
I do.

369
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.408
Be forcefuI but dignified.
Don't stoop to their IeveI.


370
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.243
- ForcefuI and dignified...
- Right.


371
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.879
Come on, it stinks of pee in here,
can you get a move on?


372
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.926
AII right!

373
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.247
Danny!
You Iisten to me, you arsehoIe!


374
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.082
We know you done that job.

375
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.042
What?

376
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.928
I don't know his Iast name!

377
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.080
OK, sorry to bother you.

378
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.401
- Great start.
- WeII, is that a two or a four?


379
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.322
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

380
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.083
I just thought - you're a woman.

381
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.924
- Yeah.
- They won't take orders from women.


382
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.639
They've just puIIed off
a muIti-miIIion pound robbery.


383
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.279
I don't think
they're gonna take you seriousIy.


384
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.601
It's the 21st century.
Women can do extortion.


385
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.319
Are you raising our consciousness
or getting the money?


386
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.641
- IdeaIIy, both.
- I reaIIy think it needs a bIoke.


387
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.483
Yeah?

388
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.447
- Danny?
- Yeah.


389
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.203
- We know you done that job.
- What?


390
00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.044
The GoIdmax Securities job.
We know it was you.


391
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.118
- Who is this?
- Never mind.


392
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.166
Just Iisten very carefuIIy.

393
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.959
We want 300 grand
or we'II go to the poIice.


394
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.840
- You must be joking.
- No joke, Danny, you sIag.


395
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:15.129
- How did you get this number?
- Under ''D'' for '' dickhead''!


396
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.008
Whoever you are, you are dead meat.

397
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.126
We'II see who 's dead meat, paI.

398
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.647
Make the drop tomorrow night.
You'II be hearing from me, tosser.


399
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.200
- I'II kiII ya!
- Yeah, right.


400
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.124
300 big ones or the cops'II
be down on you Iike a ton of...


401
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.599
- Bricks.
- Cops...bricks!


402
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.203
Up yours!

403
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.083
GirIfriend. Pain in the ass.

404
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.123
Any Iuck?

405
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.603
No.

406
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.966
I've had six peopIe round now,
not a singIe offer.


407
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.325
Maybe I shouId put a new kitchen in.

408
00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:12.369
I wasn't taIking
about your bastard fIat.


409
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.688
Forensic haven't found any prints.

410
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.362
No traces of anything.

411
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.240
The cutting equipment was imported
on faIse papers. That's a dead end.


412
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.640
WeII, that depends
how you Iook at it, doesn't it?


413
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.527
Try thinking IateraIIy.

414
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.886
One dead end
couId turn into an open highway.


415
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.280
On the other hand,
we couId try foIIowing up a cIue.


416
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.759
The diver's watch -
what do you think?


417
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.886
What about subaqua cIubs?

418
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.040
It's an uncIutched straw.

419
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.088
Might as weII get out there
and cIutch it.


420
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.799
AII right, where do we get them
to Ieave the money?


421
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.563
- ''Drop the money.'' They say drop.
- Drop.


422
00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.527
I don't know.

423
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.170
What about that big hydrangea bush?

424
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.959
A bank robber's not gonna know
what a hydrangea bush is.


425
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.368
- In the john.
- Yeah, but they Iock them at night.


426
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.608
I've got it.
Have them bury it in the sandpit.


427
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.885
No sand. Got stoIen.

428
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.282
They stoIe the sand?

429
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.008
- That's just sick.
- I know.


430
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.722
It's perfect.

431
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.967
Is that Danny?

432
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.439
- Yeah, it is.
- 300 grand, cash.


433
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.886
Streatham Park.
First bin inside the north gate.


434
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.599
- You Iisten...
- 12.30 tonight, then naff off.


435
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.319
- You're in big troubIe.
- Be there or you'II be sorry.


436
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.720
You reaIise we've gotta take
this bastard out...now.


437
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.324
Dunno. I need to speak
to Major Mason.


438
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.323
I've spoken to Mason. He says
he doesn't want a discussion,


439
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.241
he wants a nice, cIean hit.

440
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.044
- Finished.
- AII right, aII right!


441
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.247
If that's what he wants,
we'II do it.


442
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.441
My bum's gone to sIeep.

443
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.922
He's Iate.

444
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.403
- WiII you keep stiII?
- I am dying for a pee.


445
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.640
- You'II have to wait.
- I can't.


446
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.439
- You shouId have gone before.
- God, I am bursting.


447
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.248
Go in your knickers, then.

448
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.849
AII right.

449
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.764
I can't do it, 
I'm too weII trained.

450
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.842
He's not coming, is he?

451
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.364
I haven't wet myseIf
since I was five.


452
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.918
Learning about Niagara FaIIs.

453
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.646
- Is that him?
- I don't know!


454
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.044
It's him. Come on...

455
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.690
Come on, come on... Yes!

456
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.125
- It can't be as easy as this.
- Wait!


457
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.768
He might be watching.

458
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.686
Wait, wait. What's he doing?

459
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.649
Hey, don't Iook in the bin.
Don't Iook in the bin!


460
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.368
A bIoke Iike that aIways Iooks.

461
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.488
Oh, great.

462
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.004
Now you'II have to fight him for it.

463
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.768
There's someone eIse.

464
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.049
Haven't these peopIe
got homes to go to?


465
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.127
It's Mason!

466
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.246
What the heII are you up to?!

467
00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.007
- Where are you going?
- We can't just Ieave him!


468
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.246
- Oh, God!
- He's aIive.


469
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.208
- Oh, my God!
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?


470
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.362
- He ran right in front of me!
- I saw everything!


471
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.408
- I've caIIed an ambuIance.
- Breathe gentIy.


472
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.687
- Is he dead?
- Wait for the ambuIance!


473
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.728
- It wasn't my fauIt!
- I saw it - someone shot him.


474
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.722
Bastards!

475
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.604
- WiII you wait?!
- What happened?


476
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.763
He's got a buIIet in the shouIder.
PossibIe fractured skuII.


477
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.045
Can you stand back, pIease!

478
00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.087
Oh, my God! They shot that guy!
Can you beIieve they shot that guy?!


479
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.684
Yes, I bIoody can -
they're criminaIs!


480
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.080
But that couId've been
us Iying there, bIeeding!


481
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.799
We were Iucky.
That poor man wasn't, thanks to you.


482
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.848
What?! Thanks to me?!

483
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:15.444
What?! How is it suddenIy my fauIt?

484
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.363
- He's probabIy dying!
- I didn't know!


485
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:21.044
Sorry, in your worId
they don't, do they?


486
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.440
PeopIe get shot, then waIk away
and the credits roII.


487
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:29.046
This is reaI, Francis. PeopIe get
hurt and bIeed and reaIIy do die!


488
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.520
ReaIIy? I didn't know that.
Are you kidding me?


489
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.966
You think you're more in touch
with reaI suffering


490
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.359
because you empty bedpans? Come on!

491
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:43.126
If you didn't know me your Iife
wouId be even more sad and pathetic!


492
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.041
- What?!
- Yeah.


493
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.122
- I'm jeaIous of your showbiz shit?
- Yes.


494
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.599
- WeII, fuck you!
- Fuck you, too!


495
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.563
You know why you never get
any decent jobs?


496
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.720
Cos you can't act!

497
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.726
So what were you doing, Danny?

498
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.965
- Mr...
- Sit down.


499
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.927
Mr Mason, I know I screwed up.

500
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.604
- I was trying to sort it out.
- Oh, I see.


501
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.841
Someone tries to bIackmaiI us
and you sort it out


502
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.842
by shooting someone
compIeteIy different?


503
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.763
Nice IateraI thinking,
you stupid bastard!


504
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.206
I didn't know what to do,
I thought you' d be pissed off.


505
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.360
Now, you' d be right there.

506
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.681
But now I'm way off the scaIe
of pissed off.


507
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.523
There are no words
for what I am now.


508
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.080
- UnderstandabIy, Major Mason.
- What about you, Barry?


509
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.367
I was badIy misIed,
vis a vis your authorisation.


510
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.409
So, how did this bIoke
get your number?


511
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.482
I don't know.
I swear to you, I-I don't know.


512
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.164
Get him out of here
before I kiII him.


513
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.922
Give me that phone!

514
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.360
You keep out of troubIe
or I swear I wiII shoot you myseIf.


515
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.560
Copy that, roger and out.

516
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.368
One thing's for sure,
Kerrigan won't be happy about this.


517
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.566
Thanks for pointing out the obvious.

518
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.488
Nice area. Not the kind of pIace
you' d expect a street shooting.


519
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.720
- OK, keep back!
- Ex cuse me, sir.


520
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.882
- This gentIeman might...
- I Iive at number 43.


521
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.168
- I saw everything.
- Two girIs were at the scene.


522
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:16.799
- One bIonde, one brunette.
- Quite attractive.


523
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.326
I' d say it was a drive-by.
CouId be reIated to drugs.


524
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.526
Yes, I wouIdn't advertise that.

525
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.568
Prices here couId go into free faII.
Thank you.


526
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.003
Sir?

527
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.802
Fake bundIes of money.

528
00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.883
So, we've got a drop off,
a doubIe cross,


529
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.121
an ambush...and then what?

530
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.962
Then they shot a tramp.

531
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.041
Connection to the GoIdmax job?

532
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.008
A bIonde, brunette.
Bit of a coincidence.


533
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.523
Maybe.

534
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.487
Who are these women?

535
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.168
AII right,
if you can get them before 10.


536
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.241
Ex cuse me, couId we have a word?

537
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.209
I'm Detective Inspector Tremaine.
This is DC McGiII.


538
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.850
HeIIo. What do you want?

539
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.000
That man, has he said anything?

540
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.048
- Like what?
- No taIking in his sIeep? Names?


541
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.483
No.

542
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.767
No, um, he's, um, he's unconscious.

543
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.842
WeII, if he regains his facuIties,
Iet us know.


544
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.125
Of course.

545
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:21.283
Yes. That's my extension.
I'II be getting a direct Iine soon.


546
00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.520
Yes. WeII, thanks for your heIp.

547
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.285
- If he taIks, any IittIe thing.
- We' d better Iet you go.


548
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.123
- Never know, couId be important.
- Right.


549
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.520
Do you have to make it so obvious
that you fancy her?


550
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.279
- Is he OK?
- He'II Iive, just about.


551
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.883
Thank God.

552
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.801
What's that?

553
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.120
It's a present for you.

554
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.405
Thanks, it's horribIe.

555
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.369
I thought you' d throw it at me
so I didn't make much effort.


556
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.646
- Sorry about what I said.
- Me too. I didn't mean it.


557
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.881
You were right,
we shouIdn't have been invoIved.


558
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.928
- No.
- No more phone caIIs, no shootings.


559
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.447
Let's pretend this never happened.
Everything wiII be Iike it was.


560
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.758
No.

561
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.486
No, cos it can't be, can it?

562
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.209
I mean, we're invoIved now,
aren't we?


563
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.324
Nothing's Iike it was.

564
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.845
- Yeah?
- Is that Danny?


565
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.125
- Who 's this?
- Where's Danny?


566
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.724
Danny's not avaiIabIe,
you taIk to me now.


567
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.564
Oh, yeah? WeII, you
doubIe-crossed us. We had a deaI.


568
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.402
You're in big troubIe.

569
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.321
I don't think so.

570
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.162
Here's a new deaI.

571
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.640
You don't caII again
and I don't kiII you, aII right?


572
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.200
Yeah? Yeah?!
WeII, you Iisten to me, you prat.


573
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.327
You big...prat. 
Price has gone up.

574
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.607
- We want haIf a miII.
- WeII, you can get stuffed.


575
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.248
Make that a miIIion!

576
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.242
You wanna raise it again,
you piece of shit?!


577
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:46.120
Listen, whoever you are. I'II find
you and I'II hurt you. A Iot.


578
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.883
Save the scary gangster taIk,
twathead,


579
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.121
- just get that money!
- Are you threatening me?


580
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.888
A miIIion quid?!

581
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.882
- I'm sorry, it just came out.
- What did he say?


582
00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.801
He's not happy.

583
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.687
He's definiteIy not happy.

584
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.567
This way.
Mr Kerrigan is expecting you.


585
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.960
Why do I aIways have to
find out things for myseIf?


586
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.486
Wasn't worth bothering you with,
Kerrigan.


587
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.368
I Iike you, AIan,
that's why you're in charge.


588
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.363
But some joker
tries to hit me for a miIIion quid,


589
00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.487
Iooks Iike there's been a baIIs-up.
TaIk to me.


590
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:06.041
Danny was probabIy mouthing off,
guy overheard him, don't worry.


591
00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.963
I am worried!
I don't need this aggravation.


592
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.405
Look at the state of me,
I'm aII tense!


593
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:14.960
- I'm ageing prematureIy.
- Rubbish, Boss.


594
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.245
- Who is this toe rag?
- No one we know.


595
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.527
He's got a weird accent,
he sounds a bit Iike a...


596
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.566
I don't know what he sounds Iike.

597
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.722
Don't know who you're deaIing with
these days.


598
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.529
You got Turks, Russians, Kosovites...

599
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.528
AII muscIin' in.

600
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.682
I mean, who runs
CrickIewood now, JuIes?


601
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.319
- The Armenians.
- There you go. The Armenians.


602
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.004
I mean, where the heII
do they come from?


603
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.842
- Armenia, Boss.
- Good boy.


604
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.524
At Ieast someone
knows what's goin' on.


605
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.249
I toId you, I'II sort him.
Don't worry.


606
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.321
Do not teII me not to worry!

607
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.766
Who are they? Don't they know
who the fuck we are?!


608
00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.564
Give me the toweI.

609
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.325
- I'II find ' em, I'II...
- I'm bored with this subject.


610
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.402
I want their testicIes in a jar,
got that?


611
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.446
- Got it.
- Piss off.


612
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.522
Danny's phone's been cut off.
Guess we're screwed.


613
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.522
We shouId've done more research -

614
00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.249
there must be
a bIackmaiIing website.


615
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.719
AII right, what do we have?

616
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.086
We've got three names:
Danny, KeIIy and Mason.


617
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:35.403
That first caII, Danny mentioned
another name, KeIIy had been out...


618
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.243
- Right, somebody eIse was there.
- Right.


619
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.764
- Mickey!
- Mickey, that's it.


620
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.240
- And he worked in a cIub.
- Right. The...the what?


621
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.969
- The-the-the-the...

622
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:50.486
- Yeah, the something.
- AII right. But it was Iike...


623
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.767
- something in your kitchen?
- The...sink?


624
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:58.844
The sink, the fridge cIub, bread bin,
the bIender, cappuccino maker...


625
00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:02.366
- The...the Mix er!
- That's it! That's exactIy it!


626
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.806
OK, we'II do
the good-cop/bad-cop thing.


627
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.643
- What am I?
- The good cop.


628
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.006
- Can't I be the bad cop?
- No, you're too nice.


629
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.165
- Ex cuse me.
- Ex cuse me!


630
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.888
- Hi!
- Ex cuse me.


631
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.328
Hey! Hey! Hey! C'mere!

632
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.605
Where's Mickey?

633
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.169
AII right, stay caIm, we can
do this. We're undercover cops.


634
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.642
- Mickey?
- Yeah?


635
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.087
- You found me.
- Detective Inspector McGiII.


636
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.809
This is Detective...Warchowski.

637
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.245
We' d Iike to have a IittIe chat.

638
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.525
Look, I don't know where Danny is.

639
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:03.808
- Why don't I beIieve you, scumbag?
- Why are you protecting him?


640
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.485
Want me to take you down the station
and beat it out of you?


641
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.004
I don't know where he is
and I don't care!


642
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.159
Listen!

643
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.845
I know we Iook Iike girIies
but we can hurt you, Mickey.


644
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.842
Ever had a stiIetto
through the boIIocks?!


645
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.922
- Detective, can I...? A quick word.
- Don't move!


646
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.570
What are you doing?
You're the good cop.


647
00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.368
I Iike being the bad cop.

648
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.247
There can't be two bad cops.

649
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.525
No, but I know what I'm doing, OK?

650
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.165
- Oh, Christ.
- PiIIs, trips, speed.


651
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.206
- I'm aII set, thanks.
- A shag?


652
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.246
How about a punch in the mouth?

653
00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.606
You've pissed me off now, Mickey.
You know what?


654
00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.682
I'm gonna caII in the squad
to bust this pIace


655
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.489
and find haIf a kiIo

656
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:50.040
And there's a new guy
who 'II enjoy pIanting it there.


657
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.724
- How about that?
- Sounds good to me.


658
00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.120
- You copy that?
- W-w-w-wait, wait, wait. Look...


659
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.689
I might have an address.

660
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.008
So he's a scumbag, IowIife criminaI
from the East End.


661
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.400
- Is that compuIsory?
- You done a burgIary before?


662
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:09.685
- No.
- What if he comes back?


663
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.886
Can't be that difficuIt.

664
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.360
- Jump him and beat him senseIess.
- As Iong as I know.


665
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.680
OK, we're on.

666
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.278
- HeIIo?
- Yeah, it's Martin.


667
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.328
- Hi, there!
- Hi! How you doing?


668
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.203
Shit!

669
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:40.966
That's my Iibrary card, two credit
cards, my cashpoint and video cIub.


670
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:44.406
I don't get it. It aIways worked
on CharIie's AngeIs.


671
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.049
Christ.

672
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.519
You carry that with you
aII the time?


673
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:01.200
Papers, diaries, money,
anything to do with Mason.


674
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.805
Shit!

675
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.246
- FiIofax!
- Just take it.


676
00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.078
Danny? You there?

677
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.128
Who are you?

678
00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.361
If the money's right,
whoever you want me to be.


679
00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:25.883
Who are you?

680
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.928
Where's Danny?

681
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.002
Said he' d be right back.
I charge for waiting.


682
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.924
- What happened to the door?
- Shithead Iost his keys.


683
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.127
- Did he?
- So who are you, then?


684
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.041
The man in charge?

685
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.961
Mr Big?

686
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.006
I think you better go now.

687
00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.558
Go where? He hasn't paid me yet.

688
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:57.166
You guys crack me up. What do you
think I do this for - fun?


689
00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:03.120
OK. Let's say he pays you...

690
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.964
I'II pay you 50 quid...to knob off.

691
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.122
See ya.

692
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.281
Forgot my FiIofax.

693
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.838
I'm gonna go, then. See ya. Bye.

694
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.849
- Mr Mason, what you doin' here?
- I had a caII from our friend.


695
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:12.162
Guess what?
Now he wants a miIIion quid.


696
00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.159
Jesus.

697
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:18.163
And the bastard of it is, now
I've got the oId poof on me back.


698
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.047
And that's uncomfortabIe.

699
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.366
So...

700
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.406
what do I do with you, Danny?

701
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.720
I'II heIp you find him. I can do it.
I'II make it my main thing.


702
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.598
You know...
you remind me of your uncIe.


703
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.319
- He was crap and aII.
- Mr Mason, pIease don't hurt me...


704
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.366
I can do it. I can do it!

705
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:46.362
I won't rest and I won't sIeep
untiI I naiI ' em.


706
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:50.887
You do that.
You get out and you ask around.


707
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:53.279
You see what you can find out.

708
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.966
I wiII, absoIuteIy.
You can reIy on me. Thanks!


709
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.369
On the other hand...

710
00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.439
forget it.

711
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.885
Surprise!

712
00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:21.607
Danny, can you hear me?

713
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:43.481
He's been shot. Severe chest wound.
He's got a puIse but it's thready.


714
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.004
I've done everything I can.
Just get here.


715
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.122
Danny Robinson.

716
00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.964
Convictions for theft,
burgIary, accessory to robbery.


717
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.440
PIace was ransacked,
he was found shot in the chest.


718
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:59.964
Very sad.
What's it got to do with us?


719
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.518
Two women were seen
entering the fIat.


720
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.521
- One bIonde, one dark.
- Yes.


721
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.249
- Quite attractive.
- That word again.


722
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.209
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- These two are annoying me.


723
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:20.280
- Can we ask him some questions?
- No, he's in a coma. He can't taIk.


724
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:24.249
- Has he had any visitors?
- Two women, bIonde and a brunette?


725
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.760
No. No...

726
00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.887
No. No, definiteIy not.

727
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.564
Right. Thanks very much.

728
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.801
Do Iet us know if he gets
any visitors, won't you?


729
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:40.929
- You can give me a caII, any time.
- Oh, I thought...


730
00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.241
- You've aIready given her a card.
- She might have Iost it.


731
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.289
- Aren't there any other hospitaIs?
- We get aII the gunshots.


732
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.601
I found Mason's number
in here and a Iot of other names.


733
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.806
Let's turn this over to the cops.

734
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.599
Forget the poIice,
we'II get these bastards ourseIves.


735
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:05.841
And we better do it soon
or they're gonna get us.


736
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.524
- Yeah?
- HeIIo, Mason.


737
00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:42.680
How did you get this number?

738
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:47.002
I Iooked you up in the phone book,
under ''M'' for ''moron''.


739
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:51.561
Now, Iisten. We want a miIIion quid,
or we'II go to the fiIth.


740
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:53.800
Do it, you're getting nothing.

741
00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.007
You Iike having the oId poof
on your back, do you?


742
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:01.288
- What do you know about Kerrigan?
- We know a Iot about Kerrigan.


743
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:04.089
Where to find him,
what he has for breakfast,


744
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:09.164
and how many pieces of paper he uses
to wipe his big fat Khyber Pass!


745
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.640
- I want a meeting.
- A meeting? No meeting.


746
00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:14.846
No meeting, no deaI.

747
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.809
You get one more chance, sunshine,
then we go to the cops.


748
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.686
Bugger. It's not working.

749
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.125
We threaten him,
he teIIs us to piss off,


750
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.485
he wants a meeting,
we teII him to piss off.


751
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.879
It couId go on for months!

752
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.202
- We've gotta up the stakes.
- We don't have stakes to up. Do we?


753
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:02.127
- Whereabouts is it?
- ParIiament Square.


754
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:04.724
David, take me to ParIiament Square.

755
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.241
What the heII...?

756
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.522
I grant you it's embarrassing,
but it's a bIuff.


757
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:27.043
A bIuff?!

758
00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:32.045
They've got my name on a 40-foot
poster in the middIe of town!


759
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.440
My bIoody name! 
It's an outrage!

760
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:38.522
- Oh, put the bIoody thing down!
- AII right.


761
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.840
- They'II die tomorrow.
- So you said.


762
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.718
But they're stiII
very much a-fucking-Iive!


763
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:48.883
Look, it's not just your head
on the bIock here, it's aII of us.


764
00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:53.282
ExactIy. There's Danny -
he's probabIy bIabbin' right now.


765
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.840
- He won't taIk.
- He shouIdn't be abIe to taIk!


766
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.490
- He shouId be in the river!
- You be carefuI.


767
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:03.848
Without me the wheeIs wouId've
come off this operation years ago.


768
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.524
Nobody is unexpendabIe, Mason.

769
00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:12.560
Don't you threaten me, oId man,
cos right now I'm aII you've got.


770
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.720
Just shut up and Iisten.

771
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.401
This is what we do.

772
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:22.687
When they get in touch...
we agree to pay up.


773
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.365
A miIIion quid?!
Have you gone compIeteIy Tonto?!


774
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.486
We're not gonna pay ' em!

775
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:31.642
We arrange the drop,
fIush ' em out and kiII ' em!


776
00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.408
AII right.

777
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.122
AII right. Do it.

778
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.882
Mason?

779
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:48.960
One more cock-up and we say goodbye.

780
00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.402
ReIax.

781
00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.921
We're in business.

782
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:54.885
- Yeah?
- HeIIo? He's here.


783
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:58.440
- I'm getting on the train.
- Good. Just be carefuI.


784
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.088
OK, Good Iuck.

785
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.325
Listen. Get a ticket
for the next train. 47 minutes past.


786
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.562
You're cutting out.

787
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.008
- Is that better?
- What?


788
00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:26.081
Goddamn ceIIphone!

789
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:27.958
HeIIo? HeIIo?

790
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.090
HeIIo?! Can you hear me now?

791
00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.684
Just teII me which train.

792
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:39.286
The train to Brighton. Get in
the third carriage from the front.


793
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:41.725
- Where do we meet?
- I'II caII you.


794
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:43.766
- No...
- Don't miss it!


795
00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:53.603
Mind the doors!

796
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:14.763
You gotta be kidding me. Cows.

797
01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:17.000
Move it! Move it, you dumb...

798
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.725
Move, move, move it! Scram!

799
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.289
Here, here!

800
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:36.045
Fetch! Shoo! Scram! Go! Go!

801
01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.529
- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?!


802
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:49.206
- Passed Gatwick Airport yet?
- Have we passed Gatwick Airport?


803
01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.008
- What, Gatwick?
- Yeah.


804
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.206
Yes, yes, we have...passed it.

805
01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:56.604
Yeah.

806
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:59.523
Next station
the train goes over a viaduct.


807
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:03.000
As you go over it throw the case
out the Ieft hand side.


808
01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:06.082
- What?
- Make sure it goes over the edge.


809
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:09.799
I haven't come aII this way
to start chucking money away.


810
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.085
- You got that?
- Yeah...just...


811
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.161
- Just do it!
- HeIIo?


812
01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.286
Hi! How are ya?

813
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:25.442
What the heII are you doing?
This is private Iand.


814
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.600
Oh, you know, I didn't see a sign.

815
01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:29.840
You're not supposed to be here.

816
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.807
I was just admiring your cows.

817
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.361
They're reaIIy...
Are they Friesians?


818
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.281
WiII you just bugger off?

819
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:41.919
You know what? I wiII, happiIy,
in just a few seconds.


820
01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:45.400
You misunderstand,
when I say ''bugger off'' I mean it!


821
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.609
Come on.

822
01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.769
I've asked you poIiteIy -
I want you to get off my Iand, now!


823
01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.806
Oh, God, give me five minutes!

824
01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.926
- I'm teIIing you...!
- What?


825
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:06.808
You'II cut off my Iegs?
I've been there, paI.


826
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.769
- That's it. I'm caIIing the poIice.
- It doesn't work!


827
01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:17.085
- Right, throw it out.
- Throw it out?


828
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:19.684
- Over the side.
- Over the side?


829
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.762
What are you, a bIoody parrot?
Just do it!


830
01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:25.489
Come here,
stomping aII over my Iand...


831
01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.808
Christ!

832
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:36.881
It's OK, that's for me.

833
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.925
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry about your roof!


834
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.160
You're not Ieaving!

835
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.286
Look what you...

836
01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.527
Bastards! Are you OK?

837
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.602
- What the bIoody heII was that?
- You'II Iive.


838
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.643
Mother?!

839
01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:26.200
- Yeah?
- It's Kerrigan.


840
01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:28.326
Kerrigan!

841
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.844
I've been on to my man
down in the nick.


842
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.490
The poIice
are Iooking for two women.


843
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.845
- What?
- A bIonde one and a dark one.


844
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.161
That prosser in Danny's fIat,
she was one of ' em.


845
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.959
He was probabIy
shooting his mouth off to her.


846
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:48.408
- And the guy who keeps phoning?
- He's their pimp. They're amateurs.


847
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:52.324
- I knew it.
- The dark one wears a big watch.


848
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:56.085
Sort of divers watch,
Iot of fancy diaIs on it.


849
01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.523
Anything eIse?

850
01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:01.239
I don't wanna be doubIe-crossed
by a pair of bIoody tarts.


851
01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:05.801
- It's bad for my image.
- It's aII under controI.


852
01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.721
You know what you gotta do?

853
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.000
Come on, come on, come on.

854
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.642
We are now
approaching Haywards Heath.


855
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.686
Next stop, Haywards Heath.

856
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.767
Act normaIIy, or you're dead.

857
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.170
- Tickets, pIease.
- I haven't got one.


858
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.281
It's a criminaI offence.

859
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:50.128
- Shannon!
- But I'II turn a bIind eye.


860
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:53.247
- Shannon! Get in!
- Just drive!


861
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.002
- Oh, God!
- There was a bomb.


862
01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.523
- A bomb?
- Yeah!


863
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:00.799
Wankers!

864
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:03.450
Nasty, mean, horribIe,
vioIent wankers!


865
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:06.044
We've been
going about this aII wrong.


866
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.202
They want to kiII us,
why don't we kiII them?


867
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:40.923
It's Kerrigan.

868
01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:44.719
Remember I said one more cock-up
and we say goodbye?


869
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:47.403
CaII me.

870
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:44.762
HeIIo, Mason.

871
01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:55.443
- Where's the money, Mason?
- Kiss my arse!


872
01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:58.203
TeII us where it is
and we'II Iet you go.


873
01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:00.326
AII right. It's in the safe.

874
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:02.048
Did you find the safe?

875
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.564
- No.
- WeII, what have you been doing?


876
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.720
What? ''What have I been doing?''

877
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.607
You bunch of amateurs.

878
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.966
Yeah? If we're amateurs
how come you're tied up?


879
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.847
It's Kerrigan.
What is going on, AIan?


880
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.086
Pick up the phone. I hope
you're not thinking of going away.


881
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.286
He sounds a bit upset.

882
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.440
Maybe we shouId caII him back.

883
01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:32.919
He comes round, you're dead.
Suits me.


884
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.048
Admit it, you're out of your depth.

885
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.928
So what now?

886
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.448
I couId shoot you.

887
01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:48.369
- I' d hit something at this range.
- You haven't got the guts.


888
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:53.444
OK, where's the top man?
I wanna taIk.


889
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:58.520
You'II find him under ''B'',
for ''behind you.''


890
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.958
So it reaIIy is
just the two of you, is it?


891
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.286
You've made my day.
Safety catch is on.


892
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.290
Oh, dear.
It's not going weII, is it?


893
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:13.885
You think this is funny?
Do you think this is funny?


894
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:15.642
You bIoody Iow Iife!

895
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:20.204
- I've had enough.
- What are you doing?


896
01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:24.559
- What are you doing?
- InsuIin.


897
01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.722
5 miIIigrams and you're groggy.

898
01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:35.280
- You can't be serious?
- He's getting more than that.


899
01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:38.680
- Are you crazy?
- What is your probIem?


900
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.488
This has gone far enough!

901
01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:43.607
What are we gonna do,
just Iet him waIk out of here?


902
01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:48.127
- Shannon, he's not worth this!
- Now you've used my reaI name.


903
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.166
Now I'II have to kiII him.

904
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:54.163
What's happened to you?
It's just money - my God!


905
01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:55.763
It doesn't matter!

906
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:59.206
Every day I see peopIe
beaten and kiIIed for money.


907
01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:02.088
PeopIe die because
there isn't enough money.


908
01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:05.845
Money means Iife or death.
So it does matter.


909
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.602
It matters a Iot.

910
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:09.920
I don't want any part of this.

911
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:12.160
- What?
- This was your bIoody idea!


912
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:15.083
You're Ieaving
because it's too scary?


913
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:19.607
You're too scary for me!
You're out of controI! I'm Ieaving.


914
01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:21.487
- You're not.
- Or what?


915
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.558
What, you're gonna shoot me?
You can't shoot him! Grow up.


916
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:28.527
- I wiII shoot you.
- Fuck off.


917
01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.082
What?

918
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.288
Right, where were we?

919
01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.486
Keep away from me, you mad bitch!

920
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.561
No, it's aII right, Mason.

921
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:45.084
It's aII right!
It's a painIess death.


922
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:48.770
Are you worried
that you'II go to heII?


923
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:52.159
- You shouId be.
- OK, I'II teII you!


924
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:56.482
You know something -
I don't trust you. Isn't that weird?


925
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:58.481
No! God!

926
01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.959
Right. Now, that's 5 miIIigrams.

927
01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.689
Enough to make you feeI
a bit spacey.


928
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:07.563
- You want the rest?
- Behind the cabinet!


929
01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:10.244
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Yes!


930
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.247
I think that's enough.

931
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.558
You won't have to stay here
for Iong. I'II caII the poIice.


932
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:49.689
I'II find you, and you'II wish
you' d been strangIed at birth.


933
01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:51.442
Don't be so chiIdish.

934
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.486
Let me get that for you.

935
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.879
You in a spot of troubIe, guv'nor?

936
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.002
So how do you feeI now?

937
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.001
Not so brave, eh?

938
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.604
Not so bIoody cIever.

939
01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.762
- Mason residence.
- Take things from me?


940
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.365
Mr Kerrigan, guv'nor.
It's a bad Iine.


941
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:14.883
Kerrigan.
Yeah, we've got aII the money.


942
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.128
Sorry, what?

943
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:19.643
What, now?

944
01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:21.288
OK, OK!

945
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.129
You're Iucky to be aIive,
for the moment.


946
01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.360
Get the bags, we're Ieavin'.

947
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:39.759
HoId on, hoId on.
Kerrigan. He said bring her over.


948
01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.489
- Yeah?
- How did he know there's onIy one?


949
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.798
What?

950
01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:47.842
When you came in
you didn't notice anything...


951
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.046
- Iike a dead body?
- What?


952
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:10.239
Over here!

953
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.882
- You couId've kiIIed me!
- There wasn't any danger.


954
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.968
These peopIe are gonna be so sorry.

955
01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:23.201
- Ex ceIIent death.
- For someone who can't act.


956
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:28.885
Listen to my Kerrigan impression.

957
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.120
''I want her aIive. 
Bring her to me.''

958
01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:33.678
- ''Bring them.''
- I know, I know.


959
01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:46.960
Jesus, what's aII this?!

960
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.048
HeIp yourseIf.

961
01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:00.962
- You missed the house.
- I haven't got my eye in.


962
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:19.760
- Who 's out there?!
- Two women is who 's out there!


963
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:22.762
Shooting at me
with me own soddin' guns!


964
01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:44.207
- What's up?
- I dunno, I feeI sort of...


965
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.884
- We've gotta go.
- There's another bag.


966
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:50.007
- Leave it.
- No, it'II pay for a casuaIty unit!


967
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:51.967
You are so... OK, we'II get it.

968
01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:55.645
- Where's the bag?
- It's out there.


969
01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.288
Get it.

970
01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.487
- I'II cover you.
- Cover me?


971
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.721
- It's aII right, I'II use this one.
- Just wait.


972
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:40.522
BIoody heII!

973
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:43.043
Come on!

974
01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:52.084
- There's four of ' em!
- Come on, get in!


975
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.967
- I hit one of them.
- Good. That's the idea.


976
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:57.961
Left fIank! Incoming!

977
01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:01.045
Sorry, didn't mean to hit you!

978
01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:06.526
Put pressure on the wound!
I'II caII an ambuIance!


979
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:10.523
- Sergeant, we're surrounded!
- That's my bIoody car!


980
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.407
FaII back!

981
01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:18.448
We did it.

982
01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:21.765
Yeah. We did.

983
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:27.679
WeII, is this is another
dead-end or an open highway?


984
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:29.806
It's a roundabout. Turn Ieft.

985
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:38.358
Christ on a bike.
What's happened here?


986
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:43.649
Don't know. But I' d say it's knocked
a good 20,000 off the property.


987
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:46.005
Back for more, you heathens!

988
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.886
AII present and correct.

989
01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:00.806
I've seen worse than this.
Things you wouIdn't beIieve!


990
01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:04.845
And there were four of the bitches!

991
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:08.003
Four of them!

992
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:11.321
I need an ambuIance!

993
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:14.088
I've been shot!

994
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:17.568
You...

995
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.288
AII of you!

996
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.568
I Iike you.

997
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.242
Man down.

998
01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:29.764
What you have here, McGiII,
is a robbery gone bad.


999
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:34.162
FIushed with success, the gang
turn on each other Iike hungry dogs.


1000
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:38.048
Greed and vauIting ambition
was their downfaII.


1001
01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.405
What's that? HamIet?

1002
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:42.685
No. I made it up myseIf.

1003
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:46.729
I find that crime sometimes
stimuIates my creative juices.


1004
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.529
- You shouId write it down.
- Yes.


1005
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:50.679
What was it again?

1006
01:16:57.410 --> 01:17:01.164
Scanner, monitors,
defibriIIator, ECG...?


1007
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.084
- What eIse is in there?
- I dunno. An MRI scanner.


1008
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.809
- AII sorts of stuff.
- Where's it from?


1009
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:11.326
I dunno. It's aII paid for.
Sign here, it's aII yours.


1010
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:14.207
- You aII right?
- I'm OK.


1011
01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:17.043
Wasn't sure about giving
aII the money to the hospitaI.


1012
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:21.521
- You're taking it reaIIy weII.
- Am I? I feeI kinda Iiberated.


1013
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:25.649
Make a miIIion, give it aII away.
What the heII?


1014
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:28.528
- It's the right thing to do.
- You're right.


1015
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:31.602
I couIdn't Iive with myseIf
if we' d saved any.


1016
01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:39.848
Oh, my God!

1017
01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.323
Oh, my God.

1018
01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:45.799
If you can't Iive with yourseIf,
I'II understand.


1019
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.040
- You Iied to me.
- I did.


1020
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:51.280
It's OK, cos, Iook...

1021
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:56.569
I saved just a IittIe bit, too.
For food and gas, you know...


1022
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:58.766
- IncidentaIs.
- Don't expIain.


1023
01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:03.766
Oh, God.

1024
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:09.719
What's this?

1025
01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.563
- A scanner.
- ReaIIy?


1026
01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:14.049
You never know.

1027
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:20.088
You are so needy, CaroI.
You're suffocating me.


1028
01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:22.684
I-I can't breathe,
I need more space.


1029
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.840
I don't... I feeI trapped!

1030
01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:27.490
Look, if you keep
a songbird in a cage


1031
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.765
