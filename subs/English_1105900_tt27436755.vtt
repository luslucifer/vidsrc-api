1
00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:03.049
- Tom harvey has been very much

2
00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:06.185
An enigmatic,
mysterious character.


3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.591
- He was a little bit secretive

4
00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.495
About having einstein's brain
in his apartment.


5
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:22.068
- I mean, he was no hero,
but I don't think


6
00:00:22.203 --> 00:00:26.139
He did anything with
evil intentions.


7
00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:35.681
- Bottom line, he was to protect
that brain, and he did.


8
00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.820
- Tom harvey turned out
to be the man who really


9
00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:44.824
Set in motion the immortal
afterlife of einstein's brain.


10
00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:45.051
- Tom harvey is a very
mysterious fellow,


11
00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:48.221
And his motivations
are not understood.


12
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:51.757
There was high expectations
in tom's family


13
00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:55.228
For high achievement,
in professional terms.


14
00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:58.164
He had a great-grandfather
that was a doctor


15
00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.433
And a grandfather
who was a judge.


16
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.305
It was sort of a given
that he would, you know,


17
00:02:06.473 --> 00:02:09.675
Do something like that,
doctoring or lawyering,


18
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.011
And so he went to yale
for medical school,


19
00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:14.380
And he had always hoped
to be a pediatrician.


20
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:26.025
- Einstein in 1905, he's
a patent clerk, second class,


21
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.431
And he rips off five
of these earth-shattering,
paradigmatic articles.


22
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.535
You know, the annus mirabilis

23
00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:37.770
Where you're finding out
e equals mc squared,


24
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:41.807
And special relativity. I mean,
for a patent clerk in bern,


25
00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.010
Just rattling off these papers.

26
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:48.247
And then, ten years later,
learning enough mathematics


27
00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:51.617
That he could come up with the
theory of general relativity.


28
00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.086
What was going on
in this guy's head


29
00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:56.088
That he could think
of stuff like that?


30
00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:04.330
- Tom harvey was partly through
medical school at yale


31
00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:07.366
And he developed tuberculosis,

32
00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:10.836
And in those days,
to treat tuberculosis,


33
00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:13.105
They thought fresh air
was the cure,


34
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.177
So they had him set up
at the gaylord sanatorium.


35
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.116
Which was just this place
where young people were living


36
00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:27.420
All year-round,
no matter the temperature,


37
00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:30.957
And it could get cold.
And he described shivering


38
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.961
Out there and really having
a renegotiation


39
00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.797
With religion during that time.

40
00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.933
And it also turned out
to be where he met


41
00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:42.902
His first wife, elouise,

42
00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:45.838
And she was a nursing student.

43
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.042
When they both recovered, they
got married shortly after that.


44
00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.515
- Einstein came up with the
general theory of relativity,


45
00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:58.818
But it was based on many
scientists before him


46
00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:00.853
Who had come up
with the building blocks


47
00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.488
For the theory of relativity.

48
00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.524
And then, like a spark
of lightning,


49
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.527
He finished the equation
and he made it famous,


50
00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:11.364
And boom, he's on the cover
of the new york times.


51
00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:14.266
You know, he's time magazine's
person of the century.


52
00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.639
- When he comes
to the united states


53
00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:21.140
And he's mobbed at new york

54
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.376
Where there was a huge
jewish population,


55
00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:28.814
You know, they were yelling out
to him like he was the messiah.


56
00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:30.683
He was a great jew.

57
00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:34.720
And he thought this was
totally ridiculous.


58
00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:41.060
After the seizure of power
by hitler in January 1933,


59
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:43.929
He was removed from his position

60
00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:46.132
At the prussian academy
of sciences.


61
00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.868
So einstein moved
to the united states.


62
00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:51.170
He said, "I'm never returning."

63
00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:56.409
the war broke out,

64
00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:59.712
And this was difficult for tom
because he was a quaker.


65
00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:01.947
And quakers are pacifists.

66
00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:04.750
So instead of fighting
on the battlefield,


67
00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:07.687
He signed up to work
in an army pathology lab.


68
00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:14.794
In very quick succession,
elouise and tom had three sons.


69
00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.930
by the time the war was over,

70
00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:21.500
It was pretty clear to tom
that he could go back


71
00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:24.303
And be a resident and try
to become a pediatrician,


72
00:05:24.438 --> 00:05:27.506
But it would be pretty hard
to house and feed the family


73
00:05:27.674 --> 00:05:29.041
On a resident's salary.

74
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.878
Whereas if he went
into pathology,


75
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.615
Which he sort of already
had this grounding in
during the war,


76
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:38.651
He could get paid fairly well.

77
00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:05.478
Yeah.

78
00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:28.167
- Princeton had its virtues.

79
00:06:30.337 --> 00:06:33.072
My father, he was a pathologist.

80
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:40.179
It was an unusual kind of
upbringing, in that regard,


81
00:06:40.314 --> 00:06:46.952
Surrounded by organs and,
you know, bits and pieces


82
00:06:47.154 --> 00:06:49.021
Of humanity.

83
00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:52.458
And I guess one of the most
dramatic recollections


84
00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:55.427
I have of him when I was tiny,

85
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.831
He took me to watch him
do an autopsy.


86
00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:04.904
I didn't quite know
what to think about that


87
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.006
For a long time, but you know,

88
00:07:07.174 --> 00:07:10.075
He seemed so calm
about the whole process


89
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.047
That I just tried
to absorb it and enjoy it.


90
00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:38.704
At princeton university
lives new jersey's


91
00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:40.773
Most famous foreign-born
citizen,


92
00:07:40.908 --> 00:07:43.075
Professor albert einstein.

93
00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:46.579
- Albert einstein came
to princeton in '33.


94
00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.782
Only good stories.

95
00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:53.786
The stories of, you know,

96
00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:56.789
Helping kids with their
homework, they're legit.


97
00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:59.091
They've actually followed up
some of those.


98
00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.461
Even though he had
this statement about,


99
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:05.931
"it's a funny little town
with gods on stilts,"


100
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.766
But... I think
he liked the town.


101
00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:15.808
- Oh, well, the basement
was interesting.


102
00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:25.417
It was an anatomical museum
of a sort, you know,


103
00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:27.353
With organs and...

104
00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:32.157
Organs that I couldn't identify.

105
00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:36.395
You know, some of them
were clearly brains.


106
00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:41.066
It was very strange, and
it was a real source of wonder


107
00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:45.037
To friends that we would
bring over and take downstairs.


108
00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:48.207
We should've charged money.
I could've been a very...


109
00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:51.376
...Very well-off child.

110
00:08:54.348 --> 00:08:57.349
- Einstein was an interesting
man of contradictions.


111
00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:00.319
On the one hand,
he really didn't care


112
00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:02.588
What people thought about him.
He would walk around princeton


113
00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:05.925
In his pyjamas.
He had dishevelled hair,
he didn't wear socks.


114
00:09:06.127 --> 00:09:08.193
He was a man of very few
social graces.


115
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:10.829
And so, he really didn't care
what people thought about him.


116
00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:13.999
And I think that's what made him
so popular with people.


117
00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:17.469
It was kind of this, you know,
doing the opposite


118
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:20.739
Is what made him popular.
Being authentic is what
made him popular.


119
00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:57.776
- Tom harvey was always
interested in making


120
00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:01.580
Some kind of meaningful
contribution to science
and society.


121
00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:05.551
You know, when the boys
were young, he would team up


122
00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:09.588
With this cast of characters
to conduct these experiments


123
00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:11.890
In his yard and his garage.

124
00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:19.398
- An armenian doctor that had
lost his laboratory,


125
00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:23.435
He was looking
for cures to cancer.


126
00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:29.641
He wanted to use our garage
and my father said sure.


127
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:36.148
And it turned out he was using
chickens for his lab subjects.


128
00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:40.352
It was quite peculiar
for a while.


129
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.992
- The holy grail for einstein
was the theory of everything.


130
00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:51.330
The idea of saying, can you
reconcile quantum mechanics,


131
00:10:51.532 --> 00:10:53.665
Electromagnetism with gravity,

132
00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:55.300
A theory that explains
everything?


133
00:10:56.236 --> 00:10:57.636
And to his dying day,

134
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:00.472
And that's not an expression
I use loosely.


135
00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:03.742
When he died on April 18th, '55,

136
00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:06.512
There were five or six pages
of handwritten manuscript


137
00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:08.947
Where he was still
trying to come up


138
00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:13.419
With a mathematical synthesis
of the theory of everything.


139
00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:27.566
Doctor albert einstein
came to america with his wife


140
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:29.535
To escape nazi persecution.

141
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.637
His mathematical wizardry
led to the atomic age.


142
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.172
He received highest honors,

143
00:11:33.307 --> 00:11:35.641
But lived quietly at princeton,
new jersey.


144
00:11:35.809 --> 00:11:39.111
There, death came to albert
einstein. He was 76.


145
00:11:41.748 --> 00:11:44.383
- So, einstein died
at princeton hospital


146
00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:49.054
At about one o'clock in the
morning on April 18th, 1955,


147
00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:53.725
And somewhere
in the middle of that night
between that and dawn,


148
00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:58.130
A call came to tom harvey's
house from the hospital,


149
00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:01.867
And it was einstein's doctor,
guy dean,


150
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:06.438
And he said basically, "tom,
you should get over here."


151
00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:09.675
"einstein died last night,

152
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.678
And we'd like you
to do the autopsy.


153
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.182
You should come in first thing
and get to it."


154
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.755
- Well, I remember sitting
around the kitchen table


155
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:25.958
And the subject came up.

156
00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:32.531
And, of course, I had no idea
what really, you know,


157
00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:37.202
It portended in terms of what
was going to happen


158
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.638
In terms of my father's career.

159
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:44.877
- Tom harvey got ready for work
that morning and walked,


160
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:47.479
As he often did, from
his home on jefferson street


161
00:12:47.614 --> 00:12:48.714
To the hospital.

162
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:17.442
- At that point, I think there
was a realization on his part


163
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:23.448
That all of his ambitions,
which, on many levels,


164
00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:26.151
Had been thwarted
for his career,


165
00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:28.854
Were now leading him
to this moment.


166
00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:34.326
He was going to be
the pathologist, the one,


167
00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:37.095
As the chief pathologist
of princeton hospital,


168
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:40.899
To perform the autopsy
on albert einstein,


169
00:13:41.034 --> 00:13:43.969
The genius of the modern age.

170
00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:48.106
- He does the autopsy.
In the 50s, they did that,


171
00:13:48.242 --> 00:13:50.309
And he would've set to work.

172
00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:20.572
- And then he did something
that was off the script,


173
00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:23.909
And he basically takes a saw
to remove the skull,


174
00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:26.345
Reaches in, grabs the brain...

175
00:14:29.716 --> 00:14:33.218
- When I asked him
in the autopsy suite


176
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.089
Why he decided to take
albert einstein's brain,


177
00:14:37.257 --> 00:14:40.726
He said, quite unequivocally,

178
00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:43.629
You know, that this was
the brain of a genius,


179
00:14:43.831 --> 00:14:47.933
And he would've felt ashamed
if he left it.


180
00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:55.140
This was the 50s, you know,
a high time for science.


181
00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:59.578
You know, color televisions
and antibiotics


182
00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:03.649
And dna structure
had just been discovered.


183
00:15:03.784 --> 00:15:07.419
There was a whole lot of hubris
around science at that time.


184
00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:10.856
Could we find the source
of genius? Of course we can!


185
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:13.158
We just have to look
at albert einstein's brain.


186
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.831
So for tom, in that moment,

187
00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:24.836
This brain represents
all of his ambitions


188
00:15:25.004 --> 00:15:28.674
To make a meaningful
contribution to science.


189
00:15:35.515 --> 00:15:39.351
The president of the hospital
at that time wasn't a doctor


190
00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:43.955
But a really ambitious
businessman by the name
of jack kaufmann,


191
00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:47.492
And he was really keen that,

192
00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:51.029
You know, not only would they
do the einstein autopsy,


193
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:53.332
But that princeton hospital
would hold on to that brain.


194
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.870
And he was happy that tom harvey
then went out after the autopsy


195
00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:02.974
And announced this to the press,
'cause it put them on the map.


196
00:16:05.011 --> 00:16:07.479
- I don't know how the media
found out about it,


197
00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:11.717
But there's a photograph
of him, there's sort of
wrought iron veranda.


198
00:16:11.852 --> 00:16:15.087
It's on the ground level of
the princeton medical center,


199
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:17.522
And he's talking
to the reporters.


200
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.562
- And the problem came
the next day


201
00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:27.599
When einstein's family reads
about it in the new york times


202
00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:31.436
That einstein's brain
did not get cremated
with the rest of him.


203
00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:34.272
That's when things go sideways.

204
00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:41.446
- I mean, I understand that
members of einstein's family


205
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:45.517
Were very concerned
about what had happened


206
00:16:45.685 --> 00:16:49.688
And whether or not my father
should have the brain,


207
00:16:49.823 --> 00:16:54.559
And I don't know all the factors
in his decision,


208
00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:59.064
But I trusted my father
and his judgement.


209
00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:05.771
- Somehow, harvey had a
conversation with otto nathan,


210
00:17:05.906 --> 00:17:08.874
Fellow √©migr√©
and einstein's executor,


211
00:17:09.008 --> 00:17:10.976
And hans albert, his son,

212
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:14.446
And convinced them that this
is a unique specimen.


213
00:17:15.748 --> 00:17:19.551
You know, a genius for the ages,
and a man of science.


214
00:17:19.686 --> 00:17:22.254
And I'm told his son
went for it,


215
00:17:22.456 --> 00:17:26.258
And then pretty much
the executor, otto nathan,
had to go along with it.


216
00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:28.827
He said, "okay, go ahead
and study it."


217
00:17:29.629 --> 00:17:31.029
- Dear dr. Harvey...

218
00:17:49.883 --> 00:17:52.317
- And tom makes this promise,

219
00:17:52.452 --> 00:17:57.155
This oath which really
would outlast every other
he made in his life,


220
00:17:57.357 --> 00:18:02.027
Which was that he would save
the brain for scientific study


221
00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:05.497
And that it would only be used
for scientific research,


222
00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:09.167
And that anything about it,
any publicity about it


223
00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:14.206
Would only appear in scientific
or medical journals.


224
00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:20.178
That it would not become
the object of layperson's
fascination,


225
00:18:20.313 --> 00:18:23.582
Or to quote einstein,
who really didn't want people


226
00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:25.851
To come and worship
at his bones.


227
00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:29.087
So, that was tom harvey's
promise.


228
00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:44.803
- This was a violation
of einstein the man,


229
00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:47.339
Einstein the body
in such a visceral way,


230
00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:51.343
And so I find it hard
to believe that anyone would say


231
00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:53.812
Thomas harvey was doing
the right thing.


232
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.215
Who was he to make that call?

233
00:18:57.417 --> 00:19:01.086
You know, nowadays, hopefully,
I would hope that morgues


234
00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:03.188
Are run in a better fashion,

235
00:19:03.356 --> 00:19:05.123
That people can't steal
the brain.


236
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.195
- The rest of einstein
was cremated.


237
00:19:10.363 --> 00:19:12.564
That's not in the will,
but he was cremated.


238
00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:14.666
No one knows
where his ashes are.


239
00:19:16.402 --> 00:19:19.771
Some people feel
they were scattered near
the crematorium in ewing.


240
00:19:19.906 --> 00:19:23.708
Other people felt that they
scattered them on lake carnegie,


241
00:19:23.876 --> 00:19:27.746
Where einstein liked to sail
a bit, but no one really knows.


242
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.650
Harvey kept the brain.

243
00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:01.546
- People called it the heist
of the century.


244
00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:05.951
I mean, that was always
one of the crazier aspects
of this story.


245
00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:09.621
I mean, when they were
collecting einstein's papers


246
00:20:09.823 --> 00:20:11.823
And works after his death,

247
00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:15.827
There were armed guards,
like, escorting his work


248
00:20:15.962 --> 00:20:19.931
To the hebrew university
where the archives are,


249
00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.767
And yet his brain somehow ended
up going right off the grid!


250
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.484
I think that when tom first took
the brain into his possession,


251
00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:43.755
He was reading constantly
about normal brains


252
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.324
And what they looked like,
and how best to preserve them.


253
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.131
- The first thing was
to preserve the tissue,


254
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:58.837
One with formaldehyde
put through the great blood
vessels of the brain,


255
00:20:59.005 --> 00:21:03.074
And then you put it in a jar
full of formaldehyde to...


256
00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:05.944
This is double fixation.
This is what you want to do


257
00:21:06.146 --> 00:21:08.980
With specimens to reduce
artefacts so you get the most...


258
00:21:09.148 --> 00:21:10.715
The best slides.

259
00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:15.020
And then once they were
in the plastic stuff


260
00:21:15.188 --> 00:21:16.688
That you put the blocks in,

261
00:21:16.823 --> 00:21:18.990
Then you could put them
in a microtome.


262
00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:23.762
Think of like how
you slice cold cuts,


263
00:21:23.897 --> 00:21:25.597
You know, those
at the grocery store?


264
00:21:25.765 --> 00:21:28.133
Well, you got a fancier one
for that, a very special one


265
00:21:28.267 --> 00:21:30.502
That only a few people
knew how to do it.


266
00:21:34.907 --> 00:21:41.646
- After he had sectioned
the brain into, you know,

267
00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:47.652
And after he had boxes of slides
made of the brain tissue,


268
00:21:47.787 --> 00:21:52.724
He went about distributing
the brain out on a road trip


269
00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:55.694
Along the highway
to different scientists.


270
00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:02.667
It was in an effort to try
to get somebody interested


271
00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:04.569
In actually studying the brain.

272
00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:08.907
But everybody was busy,
and tom didn't have any money.


273
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.576
Who was going to study
einstein's brain for free?


274
00:22:13.146 --> 00:22:15.714
As it turned out,
not many people.


275
00:22:17.884 --> 00:22:20.885
I think a lot of the researchers
who were interested


276
00:22:21.087 --> 00:22:22.987
In getting pieces
of the brain from harvey


277
00:22:23.122 --> 00:22:26.925
Were interested,
not simply because they were


278
00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:30.195
Really interested in finding
the source of intelligence,


279
00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:33.064
But because it was
einstein's brain.


280
00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:38.937
They were, in many ways,
seduced by the allure


281
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:43.241
Of the fame of the man himself,

282
00:22:43.376 --> 00:22:46.111
The proximity to genius.

283
00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:08.867
- Harvey was invited down

284
00:23:09.069 --> 00:23:11.402
To the armed forced institute
of pathology,


285
00:23:11.538 --> 00:23:15.507
Which was kind of just
an incredible aggregation
of experts,


286
00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:18.443
In terms of any type of
pathology, but brain pathology,


287
00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:20.779
They had special experts.

288
00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:27.652
- And chief among them
was the head of neuropathology


289
00:23:27.787 --> 00:23:30.989
For the us army, a fellow
by the name of webb haymaker.


290
00:23:32.925 --> 00:23:35.260
- Haymaker was quite a guy.

291
00:23:35.428 --> 00:23:37.996
He was a chain-smoking
pathologist, wrote a bunch


292
00:23:38.164 --> 00:23:41.266
Of books, he supposedly
looked at mussolini's brain


293
00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:45.170
And robert ley's brain,
who was a nazi criminal.


294
00:23:45.305 --> 00:23:47.972
He was kind of
a hard-bitten guy,


295
00:23:48.107 --> 00:23:50.308
And he was trying to get harvey.

296
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.010
He says, "well, you are going
to leave the brain


297
00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:53.478
With us, dr. Harvey."

298
00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:57.282
And harvey, I think,
probably had anticipated that,


299
00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:59.484
'cause he didn't bring
the brain with him.


300
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.122
- He had never any intention
of turning the brain


301
00:24:04.324 --> 00:24:06.024
Over to the us military,

302
00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:09.260
Which is interesting because
he really thought, on one hand,


303
00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:12.130
It was because he had made
the personal promise
to einstein's family


304
00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:15.633
And they had given him
the permission to keep it,


305
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:17.702
Not to turn it over
to anyone else,


306
00:24:17.904 --> 00:24:22.106
And also as a pacifist
and knowing that also
einstein was a pacifist,


307
00:24:22.275 --> 00:24:26.177
He didn't want to see the brain
in the hands of the army.


308
00:24:26.345 --> 00:24:31.382
That was another motivating
factor for him to hold on to it.


309
00:24:33.486 --> 00:24:36.688
- I mean, this is a labor of
love. This is off the clock.


310
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.157
This guy's got a full-time job.

311
00:24:39.292 --> 00:24:42.460
"does my patient have kidney
cancer, dr. Harvey?"


312
00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:45.363
And he would deal with that,
but on the weekends,


313
00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:46.931
He would do this.

314
00:24:47.734 --> 00:24:51.836
- He really thought
that if he devoted himself


315
00:24:51.971 --> 00:24:56.975
To einstein's brain in this way
that it would put him in,


316
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.645
At last, the higher
annals of science.


317
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.549
The irony was that after
taking this brain


318
00:25:04.717 --> 00:25:06.551
And making this promise,

319
00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:10.021
His personal life sort of
started to unravel.


320
00:25:13.492 --> 00:25:15.693
After tom harvey took the brain,

321
00:25:15.861 --> 00:25:18.529
He became a bit
of a local celebrity, right?


322
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.068
The rumor was that tom ended up
having an affair


323
00:25:24.203 --> 00:25:28.373
With somebody at the hospital,
a lab technician or a nurse.


324
00:25:29.175 --> 00:25:32.443
And apparently,
this word got out


325
00:25:32.578 --> 00:25:34.913
And tom's wife
heard about it.


326
00:25:36.582 --> 00:25:41.920
She was livid. And so,
she went to jack kaufmann


327
00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:43.855
Who was the president
of the hospital,


328
00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:46.791
The one really happy that they
had einstein's brain,


329
00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:50.561
And she went in
and she told him, "hey!"


330
00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:52.997
Apparently, lost her temper
and said,


331
00:25:53.165 --> 00:25:54.866
"what kind of place
are you running here?


332
00:25:55.034 --> 00:25:57.101
Do you know this is happening?"

333
00:25:57.303 --> 00:26:02.440
- They broke up, they got back
together, they broke up again.


334
00:26:03.576 --> 00:26:05.443
I don't know how many times

335
00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:08.279
That happened, I think it
might've happened a third time,


336
00:26:08.447 --> 00:26:13.117
Which was when my mother
finally gave him a divorce.


337
00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:20.124
- No one really knows
why he quit his position


338
00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:22.026
At princeton medical center.

339
00:26:24.263 --> 00:26:26.898
You know, maybe his marriage
was going south,


340
00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:29.734
He had a number
of relationships in his life,


341
00:26:29.936 --> 00:26:33.504
But he quit the job or...

342
00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:37.241
Did he get pushed a bit because
of the einstein publicity?


343
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.644
No one really knows.

344
00:26:41.348 --> 00:26:43.448
- Was he fired? Did he quit?

345
00:26:43.582 --> 00:26:47.352
He certainly, sometime late
in the 60s, resigned.


346
00:26:47.554 --> 00:26:49.754
And einstein's brain
went with him.


347
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.322
- Well, when he and my mom met
and they were just dating,


348
00:27:24.524 --> 00:27:28.326
My earliest literal memory
was calling him uncle tom.


349
00:27:30.296 --> 00:27:34.132
But we started calling him
"dad" immediately.


350
00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:36.834
He is the only dad
I've ever known.


351
00:27:37.002 --> 00:27:39.237
The only dad I've ever known.

352
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.341
- All I remember is always
knowing that he did


353
00:27:43.543 --> 00:27:45.843
The autopsy on albert einstein.

354
00:27:45.978 --> 00:27:48.613
I knew he was a pathologist,

355
00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:52.517
And I'm sure when I was really
young I'm like, I don't know,


356
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:54.519
"what's a pathologist?
What's an autopsy?"


357
00:27:56.021 --> 00:28:00.091
- They met in princeton.
I know they met in princeton.


358
00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:03.494
They did so many things
together. They both loved


359
00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:05.930
Sailing, they loved
the outdoors.


360
00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:09.033
They both literally
loved the outdoors.


361
00:28:11.036 --> 00:28:14.439
- Well, my dad was
a little character.


362
00:28:14.573 --> 00:28:16.374
His personality, you know,

363
00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:19.110
Because he was kind of
a quiet man, you know?


364
00:28:19.312 --> 00:28:25.950
And wasn't a loud, boisterous,
flamboyant... But quietly.


365
00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:31.589
Quietly, like, with no words,
mowing the lawn in lederhosen.


366
00:28:31.724 --> 00:28:36.260
You know, just entertaining
his guests with his kilt on.


367
00:28:36.462 --> 00:28:38.563
You know, just quietly doing it,

368
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:42.967
Not bringing any other attention
than it was already bringing.


369
00:28:44.336 --> 00:28:48.172
- My dad had a pair
of leather lederhosen.


370
00:28:49.475 --> 00:28:52.577
And whenever he had those on,

371
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:56.214
It was the day we had to be
cleaning the yard.


372
00:28:57.951 --> 00:29:00.585
He mowed the lawn
in his lederhosen


373
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.954
With the socks
and the suspenders


374
00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:06.491
And the little ivory thing
and the whole...


375
00:29:08.928 --> 00:29:13.498
He played the banjo
and he played the accordion.


376
00:29:13.633 --> 00:29:16.968
- He had his office
in the basement


377
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.170
In the very back
left corner,


378
00:29:19.372 --> 00:29:22.607
And you know, one of those big,
wooden desks,


379
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:25.576
And bookshelves with
loads of books,


380
00:29:25.778 --> 00:29:29.113
And he had the brain there.

381
00:29:34.053 --> 00:29:39.557
- And I happened to see this jar
with a brain in it.


382
00:29:39.692 --> 00:29:43.961
And I asked what it was,
and he told me,


383
00:29:44.129 --> 00:29:46.464
But we weren't allowed
to talk about it.


384
00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:50.401
We were not allowed
to talk about it.


385
00:29:52.338 --> 00:29:54.672
- Well, yeah, I'm the one
who wanted like,


386
00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:56.340
"can I bring it
into school?"


387
00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:59.644
And you know,
but it was like, "no."


388
00:30:00.713 --> 00:30:03.981
And any time I had a friend
over, "come on, let me show you


389
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:05.316
Where the brain is!"

390
00:30:05.451 --> 00:30:06.817
And we'd go down the stairs

391
00:30:06.986 --> 00:30:08.553
And into the back room,
and there it is!


392
00:30:43.355 --> 00:30:47.024
- In 1975, we moved to kansas.

393
00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:50.328
Now, living in new jersey
and moving to wichita,


394
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.265
Which all we ever heard about
was dodge city,


395
00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:56.701
Cowboys and indians,
and we literally thought,


396
00:30:56.836 --> 00:30:58.836
"we're gonna be the only people

397
00:30:58.971 --> 00:31:01.072
In the state of kansas
with a car."


398
00:31:02.908 --> 00:31:05.743
And I'm not kidding,
that's what we thought.


399
00:31:05.878 --> 00:31:08.246
- And it was hard, because then,

400
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.249
You know, all our real close
friends were in new jersey.


401
00:31:11.383 --> 00:31:14.518
And I don't think it affected
my younger sisters,


402
00:31:14.653 --> 00:31:17.255
They were young. But...

403
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:20.791
I just know that
that's hard on kids.


404
00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:26.464
And also to pull my mom away
from all her friends and family,


405
00:31:26.632 --> 00:31:29.600
You know, just where we grew up.

406
00:31:30.602 --> 00:31:33.404
- It was different.
It was different.


407
00:31:34.406 --> 00:31:37.308
'cause my parents,
their marriage ended there,


408
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.011
So that was hard. Really hard.

409
00:32:07.373 --> 00:32:10.508
- Every time tom moves,
otto nathan,


410
00:32:10.642 --> 00:32:13.077
Einstein's executor
tracks him down,


411
00:32:13.212 --> 00:32:16.180
And he keeps writing tom
these impatient letters,


412
00:32:16.315 --> 00:32:18.683
Basically begging him
for an update


413
00:32:18.818 --> 00:32:22.586
On what's happening
with the study of his great
friend's brain.


414
00:32:23.856 --> 00:32:26.724
- It's a little bit of,
what I would call,


415
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:28.826
An asymmetric correspondence,

416
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:32.863
Because it's overwhelmingly
nathan pleading with harvey


417
00:32:32.998 --> 00:32:37.668
To do something with that brain.

418
00:32:37.803 --> 00:32:39.770
- Dear dr. Harvey...

419
00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:55.486
- Some 23 years past
since einstein's death,


420
00:32:55.654 --> 00:33:00.658
And there was a particular
editor who assigned


421
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.361
A young reporter by the name
of steven levy


422
00:33:03.563 --> 00:33:05.529
To go in search
of einstein's brain,


423
00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:07.365
And this actually would set off

424
00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:09.767
What became
the recurring pattern.


425
00:33:09.935 --> 00:33:13.437
So, somebody in the media
would say,


426
00:33:13.572 --> 00:33:15.539
"hey, whatever happened
to einstein's brain?


427
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:16.774
We should find out."

428
00:33:18.077 --> 00:33:20.077
- And one day, my editor,

429
00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:22.646
He was a pretty new editor
who would come from new york,


430
00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:26.250
Told me, "I want you to find
einstein's brain."


431
00:33:26.452 --> 00:33:28.552
It was a crazy assignment.

432
00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:30.488
Einstein's brain is missing?

433
00:33:30.623 --> 00:33:32.323
I hadn't heard anything
about that.


434
00:33:34.827 --> 00:33:38.929
And my editor told me,
"by the way, I want to use this


435
00:33:39.064 --> 00:33:40.798
For the August cover story."

436
00:33:40.966 --> 00:33:44.769
Which only gave me a few weeks
to find einstein's brain,


437
00:33:44.971 --> 00:33:48.639
Something no one had done
in more than 20 years.


438
00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:53.010
First point of contact was
dr. Otto nathan,


439
00:33:53.145 --> 00:33:57.481
Who was the executor
of the einstein estate.


440
00:33:57.616 --> 00:33:59.984
And he gave me no help.

441
00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:02.586
He was aggressively
not interested


442
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:04.955
In following up on this.

443
00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:10.461
The new york times article
had said the brain had been


444
00:34:10.663 --> 00:34:13.264
Removed from the body
by dr. Thomas harvey.


445
00:34:13.466 --> 00:34:17.835
And you know, there was no way
to google him back then in 1978,


446
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:21.872
But there were ways to look
people up, and eventually,


447
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.644
I realized that since
he was a physician, an md,


448
00:34:26.812 --> 00:34:28.879
The american medical association

449
00:34:29.081 --> 00:34:32.149
Might know where he is
or who he was.


450
00:34:32.351 --> 00:34:34.652
I want you to find
this guy, dr. Thomas harvey...


451
00:34:34.786 --> 00:34:36.854
And I called them up,
their office was in chicago.


452
00:34:37.022 --> 00:34:41.258
And I talked some very nice
woman there into telling me,


453
00:34:41.426 --> 00:34:45.796
You know, the numbers
of any dr. Thomas harvey.


454
00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:49.867
There was a dr. Thomas s.
Harvey, I knew his middle name,


455
00:34:50.035 --> 00:34:53.037
And she said there's one
in wichita, kansas.


456
00:34:54.873 --> 00:34:57.341
I arrived in wichita.

457
00:34:57.509 --> 00:35:00.744
By the time I got there,
there was a torrential rain,


458
00:35:00.913 --> 00:35:05.149
And the taxi cab is driving
and bumping around


459
00:35:05.317 --> 00:35:09.053
And going through giant puddles
the size of bomb craters.


460
00:35:10.389 --> 00:35:13.724
And I arrive
at this medical lab.


461
00:35:13.859 --> 00:35:16.093
And I had been under the
impression that it would be


462
00:35:16.228 --> 00:35:19.497
Some sort of research lab
with state-of-the-art equipment


463
00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:21.899
And people going around

464
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:24.235
And doing advanced
scientific research,


465
00:35:24.403 --> 00:35:27.705
But it was the kind of lab
you'd go to get a blood test.


466
00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:33.477
And dr. Harvey greeted me
at the door.


467
00:35:33.612 --> 00:35:35.479
I think we both were
a little nervous,


468
00:35:35.681 --> 00:35:39.717
And took me back through the lab
to his office,


469
00:35:39.852 --> 00:35:45.422
Which was sort of a glass
enclosure towards the back
of the building,


470
00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:49.493
And we sat in his office
and began to talk.


471
00:35:51.597 --> 00:35:57.034
He was definitely nervous about
talking about this and feeling,


472
00:35:57.236 --> 00:36:00.771
You know, almost as if there
had been some other ear


473
00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:03.240
In the room that was listening

474
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.476
With a voice saying,
"no, no, no, no,


475
00:36:05.644 --> 00:36:07.111
You shouldn't be
talking about this."


476
00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:13.651
And I'm listening to this
and taking it in.


477
00:36:13.786 --> 00:36:16.453
I'm realizing I'm hearing things
that haven't been said


478
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:18.389
For over 20 years,

479
00:36:18.524 --> 00:36:20.157
But on the other hand
I'm wondering,


480
00:36:20.292 --> 00:36:23.427
"where's the brain?"
so I keep pressing him on this,


481
00:36:23.562 --> 00:36:27.064
And finally. I get frustrated
and say, "don't you even have


482
00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:29.266
Like a photograph
of einstein's brain?


483
00:36:29.468 --> 00:36:31.468
Anything I could look at?"
'cause I'm thinking


484
00:36:31.604 --> 00:36:34.471
My whole mission
might be going to naught.


485
00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:38.542
He said, "well, I do have some
of the gross matter here."


486
00:36:39.478 --> 00:36:40.844
What?

487
00:36:43.448 --> 00:36:47.217
So, I better describe
what this room was like.


488
00:36:49.054 --> 00:36:54.959
I'm sitting in a chair
and behind me are some
cardboard boxes,


489
00:36:55.094 --> 00:36:58.395
And there's kind of like
a red cooler off to the side.


490
00:37:00.432 --> 00:37:05.636
So he gets up from his desk
without a word


491
00:37:05.771 --> 00:37:08.472
And walks, kind of like cuts
in front of me,


492
00:37:08.607 --> 00:37:10.641
Kind of where the cooler is,
and I'm wondering,


493
00:37:10.843 --> 00:37:12.910
Is einstein's brain
in a beer cooler?!


494
00:37:13.112 --> 00:37:16.180
But no, he keeps walking and
he goes to the cardboard box


495
00:37:16.382 --> 00:37:20.551
Behind me. I look at it
and it has a legend on the box.


496
00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:22.086
"costa cider."

497
00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:25.656
And there's like stuff inside

498
00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:29.293
And he goes up and there's
kind of yellowed masking tape


499
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:34.832
Around the thing and he said,
"well, this is the cerebellum,


500
00:37:34.966 --> 00:37:38.202
And these are aortic vessels."

501
00:37:38.404 --> 00:37:42.873
And I'm looking at it. It's
definitely brain-like stuff,


502
00:37:43.008 --> 00:37:47.111
And it is einstein's brain.
I'm looking at it right then!


503
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.181
And before I could even
collect myself, he goes


504
00:37:51.316 --> 00:37:54.051
And gets this other jar,
and there's these things,


505
00:37:54.186 --> 00:37:56.654
They look like goldenberg's
peanut chews,


506
00:37:56.856 --> 00:38:00.524
Which are these candies
in the philadelphia area,
maybe about this big.


507
00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:03.594
And he said, "well,
these are the sectioned parts


508
00:38:03.796 --> 00:38:06.263
Of the brain." and each one
was labelled with a number


509
00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:08.732
That described where it was
in his brain.


510
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.369
And there it was!
Einstein's brain!


511
00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:22.746
So, at first, I was stunned
that it was really there,


512
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:25.516
My mission was accomplished.

513
00:38:25.684 --> 00:38:29.687
And then I realized that...

514
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:34.425
Why people were so fascinated
with this, because there it was,


515
00:38:34.559 --> 00:38:39.063
The physical... Source

516
00:38:39.265 --> 00:38:44.334
Of these theories
and discoveries


517
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.937
That literally changed
our world.


518
00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:49.973
You know, changed the way
we perceive the world,


519
00:38:50.142 --> 00:38:54.878
The universe. And there was
sort of a magic to it.


520
00:39:00.152 --> 00:39:02.820
The story was our August cover.

521
00:39:03.022 --> 00:39:05.089
And it caught fire.

522
00:39:05.224 --> 00:39:08.058
This was pre-internet,
but at the time,


523
00:39:08.193 --> 00:39:09.693
Things could get picked up,

524
00:39:09.828 --> 00:39:11.495
You know, in a pony express
kind of way.


525
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.332
And you know, I spent
two days doing one radio


526
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.433
Interview after another.

527
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:18.736
- And now, ladies and gentlemen

528
00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:21.205
Here's...

529
00:39:21.373 --> 00:39:22.139
Johnny!

530
00:39:23.308 --> 00:39:24.908
- The apex was, johnny carson

531
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.610
Made a joke about it.

532
00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.114
- Now, here's an unusual item,
I hope it doesn't turn you off


533
00:39:30.316 --> 00:39:31.515
Because it's kind of
a scientific item,


534
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.618
But portions of albert
einstein's brain


535
00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:38.088
Have turned up in a laboratory
in wichita, kansas.


536
00:39:38.223 --> 00:39:39.623
Remains were found
in a jar there...


537
00:39:43.161 --> 00:39:44.361
What really convinced

538
00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:45.996
The scientists
in wichita, kansas,


539
00:39:46.131 --> 00:39:47.664
That it was einstein's brain,

540
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.666
One morning,
they came into the lab,


541
00:39:49.802 --> 00:39:53.103
And they saw the brain checking
the greyhound schedule bus


542
00:39:53.238 --> 00:39:54.371
Leaving wichita.

543
00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:56.340
So they figured it was einstein.

544
00:39:57.743 --> 00:39:59.877
- I was watching
the johnny carson show.


545
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.682
And he made reference to, um...

546
00:40:05.818 --> 00:40:08.452
Einstein's brain

547
00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.288
Getting off a greyhound bus.

548
00:40:11.423 --> 00:40:12.956
In wichita, kansas.

549
00:40:14.392 --> 00:40:16.994
And of course, you know,
it was just like...


550
00:40:17.128 --> 00:40:20.464
Oh my gosh,
they followed us here.


551
00:40:22.033 --> 00:40:24.401
- Now, I shared the story
with him,


552
00:40:24.569 --> 00:40:25.936
On the eve of publication.

553
00:40:26.104 --> 00:40:28.972
And I send him
the advance copy as well.


554
00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:33.143
He was okay with the story.
He felt it was fine.


555
00:40:34.246 --> 00:40:36.647
But then, the story came out,

556
00:40:36.782 --> 00:40:38.882
The news hit,

557
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.351
The einstein estate was unhappy,

558
00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:45.189
And there were people camped out
on his lawn wanting interviews.


559
00:40:45.324 --> 00:40:47.224
And his life was changed...

560
00:40:48.493 --> 00:40:50.928
Dramatically,
because of that story,


561
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.263
Because the secret
being public.


562
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.466
He wasn't too happy.

563
00:40:56.602 --> 00:40:58.468
And from that moment on,

564
00:40:58.604 --> 00:41:01.038
He was the person who had
einstein's brain.


565
00:41:01.172 --> 00:41:03.774
Even worse, he was the person
who had einstein's brain


566
00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:06.076
Who had a lot of questions
to answer about it.


567
00:41:08.013 --> 00:41:09.446
- Dear dr. Harvey,

568
00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:13.383
I'm writing you to renew our
acquaintance of almost 27 years,


569
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:17.621
But also to inquire about your
present intention to describe


570
00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:19.990
And publish your work
on einstein's brain.


571
00:41:21.459 --> 00:41:23.293
- It's like this homework
assignment,


572
00:41:23.495 --> 00:41:25.462
One of those nightmares
you have.


573
00:41:25.597 --> 00:41:27.831
You have this long-standing,
important assignment


574
00:41:27.966 --> 00:41:29.566
That you haven't completed.

575
00:41:29.701 --> 00:41:31.802
For decades, this poor man

576
00:41:31.937 --> 00:41:35.272
Had not been able to complete
his assignment.


577
00:41:35.407 --> 00:41:38.642
- So, steve levy
writes his article


578
00:41:38.777 --> 00:41:40.510
And it makes a big splash.

579
00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:42.746
And you know, it seemed like

580
00:41:42.914 --> 00:41:46.016
The whole world had forgotten
about einstein's brain.


581
00:41:47.085 --> 00:41:51.989
And science, which is one of
the leading science journals,


582
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.491
In the world, actually,
and based in the united states,


583
00:41:54.626 --> 00:41:57.661
They actually feature a picture
from levy's article


584
00:41:57.863 --> 00:41:59.630
Of the brain in the cider box.

585
00:42:00.298 --> 00:42:04.968
And someone in the lab
of marian diamond at berkeley


586
00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:08.739
Cuts it out and pins it up on
the bulletin board in the lab.


587
00:42:09.641 --> 00:42:14.478
And marian diamond is this,
you know, dynamo maverick,


588
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.214
Brain researcher, at the time,

589
00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:19.583
Who was really
ahead of her time.


590
00:42:20.285 --> 00:42:23.153
She was doing all kinds
of studies proving


591
00:42:23.288 --> 00:42:25.022
That we are born with a brain,

592
00:42:25.157 --> 00:42:28.325
But that the brain can change,
depending on our environment.


593
00:42:29.228 --> 00:42:31.728
She was showing that there was
a kind of brain cell


594
00:42:31.896 --> 00:42:33.163
Called the glial cell,

595
00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:35.399
Which is like a nursemaid
to neurons,


596
00:42:35.533 --> 00:42:38.168
And the more of them you have,
the better your neurons work.


597
00:42:38.303 --> 00:42:40.904
So this is how a brain
could grow.


598
00:42:41.573 --> 00:42:43.240
So she's doing
this kind of work,


599
00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.409
And it's in this environment
that she looks over


600
00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:48.812
At her bulletin board
and she sees this picture


601
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.580
From the magazine

602
00:42:50.716 --> 00:42:52.716
Of einstein's brain
in a cider box.


603
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:56.687
And she think, "hmm, I wonder
how many glial cells he had."


604
00:42:56.821 --> 00:42:59.556
And she thinks,
"okay, how do I get that?"


605
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:03.193
And this then takes her
onto the rabbit chase


606
00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:05.262
Of finding tom harvey.

607
00:43:35.027 --> 00:43:37.794
- He always wanted to be
a family doctor.


608
00:43:37.962 --> 00:43:40.330
But he was a pathologist
his whole life.


609
00:43:40.465 --> 00:43:43.266
So here he was in his 70s,

610
00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:46.336
Becoming a family doctor
for the first time.


611
00:43:47.939 --> 00:43:49.940
Everybody called him "doc".

612
00:43:51.643 --> 00:43:54.745
If somebody didn't have money
to be treated,


613
00:43:54.913 --> 00:43:56.179
He treated them anyway.

614
00:43:56.381 --> 00:43:59.416
If they'd bake him a loaf
of bread, and we were even.


615
00:43:59.584 --> 00:44:01.485
He made house calls.

616
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.987
He was "that" person.

617
00:44:04.122 --> 00:44:08.325
He genuinely cares about people.

618
00:44:13.832 --> 00:44:17.000
- When I first met
dr. Tom harvey,


619
00:44:17.202 --> 00:44:19.803
The first week I worked for him,

620
00:44:21.306 --> 00:44:23.073
The telephone rang.

621
00:44:23.275 --> 00:44:25.142
The man on the other line said,

622
00:44:25.277 --> 00:44:27.811
"could I speak to
dr. Thomas harvey?"


623
00:44:28.013 --> 00:44:29.513
And I said, "who's calling,
please?"


624
00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:32.215
And he said, "david hartman
from good morning america."


625
00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:36.353
Young girl in her 20s,
I got really excited.


626
00:44:36.488 --> 00:44:38.688
Jumped up,
ran to doctor's office.


627
00:44:38.824 --> 00:44:40.624
He said, "oh, you take care
of it.


628
00:44:40.826 --> 00:44:42.459
And don't tell him anything."

629
00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:45.429
We were busy. We were busy

630
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:49.232
Taking care of everyday life,
for people.


631
00:44:49.367 --> 00:44:50.901
Keeping them healthy,

632
00:44:51.103 --> 00:44:54.204
Treating emergencies,
making house calls.


633
00:44:54.339 --> 00:44:56.039
I think he was really happy.

634
00:44:56.241 --> 00:44:58.508
He loved what he was doing.

635
00:45:00.112 --> 00:45:02.546
He did other things
in his life:


636
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.281
Working emergency rooms,

637
00:45:04.416 --> 00:45:08.685
To try to support his family
and his lifestyle.


638
00:45:10.722 --> 00:45:13.623
- As somebody who had gone
to medical school,


639
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:15.358
You know, in the '30s,

640
00:45:15.493 --> 00:45:18.161
And then, had done a general
pathology residency, I mean,


641
00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:19.963
Sure, you understand
what the heart does


642
00:45:20.098 --> 00:45:21.898
And what the kidneys do,
but that's something else


643
00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:24.534
If somebody comes in with
a urinary tract infection.


644
00:45:24.669 --> 00:45:26.503
You haven't spent several years

645
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:28.872
Learning the ropes
of practicing medicine.


646
00:45:29.007 --> 00:45:30.841
So he did that for a while.

647
00:45:32.143 --> 00:45:34.578
- I guess there was
a complaint against him,


648
00:45:34.713 --> 00:45:37.514
At the time, and he was
in his mid-70s.


649
00:45:37.649 --> 00:45:40.550
And so, this complaint
results in a hearing,


650
00:45:40.685 --> 00:45:42.385
And I think there's
a realization that,


651
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.821
"whoa, this doctor is like
in his mid-70s.


652
00:45:45.023 --> 00:45:48.592
I think you better take your
state licensing exam again."


653
00:45:49.827 --> 00:45:51.528
- He actually had to...

654
00:45:51.663 --> 00:45:54.898
Sit for the boarding exams
somewhere in the midwest.


655
00:45:56.168 --> 00:45:58.869
I don't know, at that point,
what is he? He's in his 80s?


656
00:45:59.003 --> 00:46:02.506
And those exams
are very challenging.


657
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:03.874
And I think he came close,

658
00:46:04.042 --> 00:46:06.710
But he couldn't get
relicensed for that.


659
00:46:07.946 --> 00:46:10.814
- They said he diagnosed
them incorrectly.


660
00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:14.050
And when...

661
00:46:14.186 --> 00:46:16.720
And when he had to give
his license back...


662
00:46:16.922 --> 00:46:20.724
Oh! The diagnosis was correct!

663
00:46:21.292 --> 00:46:23.827
He did not misdiagnose anybody.

664
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.497
Just conclusions were jumped to.

665
00:46:27.665 --> 00:46:30.133
And because that doctor
didn't agree with the way


666
00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:33.470
He was being treated,
the diagnosis...


667
00:46:33.605 --> 00:46:35.472
Automatically thought
it was wrong.


668
00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:37.541
But it wasn't.

669
00:46:37.676 --> 00:46:38.942
I wasn't there.

670
00:46:39.077 --> 00:46:42.212
I don't remember exactly
what he gave this patient.


671
00:46:43.548 --> 00:46:45.649
But it was the right treatment.

672
00:46:50.956 --> 00:46:52.289
- As the story goes,

673
00:46:52.424 --> 00:46:54.024
That's when otto nathan
writes harvey


674
00:46:54.158 --> 00:46:56.493
And indignant letter saying,

675
00:46:56.695 --> 00:46:58.428
"you've had the brain
for quite some time.


676
00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:00.130
Why are you not publishing?"

677
00:47:01.566 --> 00:47:05.268
So, clearly, the expectation
was harvey should keep the brain


678
00:47:05.403 --> 00:47:07.871
For scholarly study,

679
00:47:08.039 --> 00:47:12.175
And if anything, he was getting
berated for not doing enough.


680
00:47:13.445 --> 00:47:16.680
- Tom harvey's getting a lot
of pressure from otto nathan


681
00:47:16.814 --> 00:47:18.949
In the letters, saying, "hey!

682
00:47:19.117 --> 00:47:21.618
I've seen this article
in new jersey monthly.


683
00:47:21.753 --> 00:47:23.420
I'm really not so happy

684
00:47:23.554 --> 00:47:25.488
That the brain
is in a costa cider box,


685
00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.692
And it's being compared
to some kind of candy chews.


686
00:47:28.826 --> 00:47:30.293
And what the heck?!

687
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:31.628
Like, where's
the study already?"


688
00:47:31.796 --> 00:47:34.397
And so, what happens
is tom's like,


689
00:47:34.599 --> 00:47:37.167
So delighted to hear
from marian diamond


690
00:47:37.302 --> 00:47:39.369
Who's, you know,
this maverick researcher


691
00:47:39.504 --> 00:47:42.372
That he immediately goes
to his jars


692
00:47:42.507 --> 00:47:45.976
And fishes out four pieces
of einstein's brain,


693
00:47:46.144 --> 00:47:47.677
And...

694
00:47:47.879 --> 00:47:51.681
Puts them in a mayonnaise jar
and they arrive at berkeley.


695
00:47:54.519 --> 00:47:58.488
Then, she begins this really,
really tedious study


696
00:47:58.623 --> 00:48:02.826
Of counting the glial cells
einstein had per neuron,


697
00:48:03.028 --> 00:48:04.928
Compared to average brains.

698
00:48:06.364 --> 00:48:09.366
And she concludes that einstein
had more


699
00:48:09.568 --> 00:48:13.703
Of these glial cells, generally,
than other people.


700
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.241
- So we had hypothesized,
if we were dealing


701
00:48:18.443 --> 00:48:20.677
With one of the greatest brains
that's ever lived


702
00:48:20.845 --> 00:48:23.313
That we should find more
glial cells per neuron.


703
00:48:23.515 --> 00:48:25.515
And that's essentially
what we did find.


704
00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:29.419
- In fact, dr. Diamond
found 73% more glial cells


705
00:48:29.587 --> 00:48:30.854
Than average.

706
00:48:31.723 --> 00:48:34.090
- Of course, you know,
she's not got a lot of genius


707
00:48:34.225 --> 00:48:35.725
Brains for comparison,

708
00:48:35.927 --> 00:48:38.762
And she publishes this
in a friend's journal


709
00:48:38.896 --> 00:48:41.097
Because she's wanting
to give her friend a boost,


710
00:48:41.265 --> 00:48:42.966
And it was called
experimental neurology.


711
00:48:43.101 --> 00:48:44.934
So it comes out in the 1980s.

712
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:49.272
And you know, she's really
hopeful that it will be, um,


713
00:48:49.407 --> 00:48:50.874
You know, something
that will help bring


714
00:48:51.076 --> 00:48:54.077
More attention to her work
and that it would boost


715
00:48:54.212 --> 00:48:55.679
The journal and so on...

716
00:48:55.814 --> 00:48:59.949
And instead, it's met with
some pretty fierce criticism.


717
00:49:02.087 --> 00:49:06.423
And in fact, a lot of people
used her study as an example


718
00:49:06.557 --> 00:49:08.358
Of not good science,
of bad science.


719
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.660
There was one researcher
who even used to post


720
00:49:10.795 --> 00:49:13.229
A slide in his powerpoints
as a kind of joke


721
00:49:13.432 --> 00:49:14.931
To break the ice.

722
00:49:17.468 --> 00:49:20.503
So came the very first
sort of public suggestions


723
00:49:20.705 --> 00:49:24.107
That scientists who were
interested in studying


724
00:49:24.242 --> 00:49:27.944
This brain were more seduced
by the idea of celebrity,


725
00:49:28.112 --> 00:49:31.181
Less by the idea
of doing serious science.


726
00:49:34.853 --> 00:49:40.290
- Some of them were interested
for purely scientific reasons.


727
00:49:41.192 --> 00:49:43.993
And they had valid...

728
00:49:44.729 --> 00:49:48.965
Issues about whether
they could continue with...


729
00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:51.368
A certain line
of research or not.


730
00:49:51.502 --> 00:49:54.104
But still fascinates people...

731
00:49:55.874 --> 00:49:58.308
...On multiple levels, you know.

732
00:49:58.443 --> 00:49:59.709
And...

733
00:50:00.412 --> 00:50:01.945
I don't know.

734
00:50:02.147 --> 00:50:04.280
I guess...

735
00:50:05.082 --> 00:50:07.016
Even if they had
some of the brain,


736
00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:11.821
You know, what can you
ascertain from one sample?


737
00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:14.858
How important could that be?

738
00:50:19.431 --> 00:50:23.099
- When he was in weston,
he was married to rachelle.


739
00:50:23.267 --> 00:50:25.301
That was his third wife.

740
00:50:25.504 --> 00:50:28.938
But he worked almost 24-7.

741
00:50:30.675 --> 00:50:33.576
He would leave the clinic
and go to ers to work.


742
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.178
He worked at the prison,

743
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.847
He just... That was his life,
was to work.


744
00:50:38.049 --> 00:50:41.284
So I imagine it was
a lonely life for her.


745
00:50:43.488 --> 00:50:46.256
I later found out
that they divorced,


746
00:50:46.424 --> 00:50:49.325
After he lost his license.

747
00:51:02.907 --> 00:51:08.278
- When I met tom, he was
working second shift at e & e.


748
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.381
It's kind of inherently
dangerous work.


749
00:51:13.218 --> 00:51:15.318
During the time I worked
at e & e,


750
00:51:15.453 --> 00:51:19.222
I watched a young woman
cut her index finger off.


751
00:51:20.892 --> 00:51:24.994
I was 20 feet away when actually
a very good friend of mine


752
00:51:25.129 --> 00:51:27.096
Used a radial saw and kind of

753
00:51:27.232 --> 00:51:29.499
Sliced down the middle
of his finger this way.


754
00:51:29.701 --> 00:51:31.968
I mean, there...
Yes, there were plenty


755
00:51:32.103 --> 00:51:33.303
Of accidents all the time.

756
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.076
- By the time tom is, you know,
at an age when most people


757
00:51:40.244 --> 00:51:41.978
Would be thinking
about retiring


758
00:51:42.113 --> 00:51:43.713
And putting their feet up
and so on,


759
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:45.515
He is, you know,

760
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.885
Working flat out
at a plastics factory.


761
00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.626
- He was working on the back
of a machine called an extruder.


762
00:51:56.794 --> 00:52:00.163
An extruder is kind of like
a play-doh hair factory.


763
00:52:00.331 --> 00:52:02.499
I don't know if you had one
of those when you were a kid,


764
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:04.701
But you cram all
the play-doh in here,


765
00:52:04.835 --> 00:52:07.871
And then you use this lever
and you crank down on it


766
00:52:08.039 --> 00:52:10.340
And it comes out over here.

767
00:52:10.475 --> 00:52:12.342
You can make it
into certain shapes.


768
00:52:12.544 --> 00:52:14.711
You can put the star
attachment on


769
00:52:14.845 --> 00:52:17.480
And it comes out
as a cross-sectional star,


770
00:52:17.615 --> 00:52:19.716
Or a tube, or whatever
you wanna do.


771
00:52:19.884 --> 00:52:22.218
That's essentially
what an extruder is.


772
00:52:23.755 --> 00:52:27.991
And so, tom's job was, he was
on the back-end of the thing


773
00:52:28.193 --> 00:52:32.228
Taking off this long extrusion
and cutting it to size.


774
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.731
So for 8 to 10 hours a day,

775
00:52:34.865 --> 00:52:37.200
Tom would pull a part off
the extruder,


776
00:52:37.368 --> 00:52:40.003
Wait for an automatic saw
to cut it roughly,


777
00:52:40.171 --> 00:52:42.872
And then, he would put it
in a jig and use a radial saw,


778
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.008
Cut one in,
put it in the other end,


779
00:52:45.142 --> 00:52:46.843
And cut the other end.

780
00:52:47.045 --> 00:52:48.845
Can you believe that?

781
00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:53.750
Tom was a little bit
of a misfit, initially.


782
00:52:54.786 --> 00:52:58.555
Eventually, tom became
very well liked.


783
00:53:00.992 --> 00:53:04.093
Every month, we would pick
an employee of the month.


784
00:53:04.228 --> 00:53:05.862
And I couldn't even begin

785
00:53:06.064 --> 00:53:07.830
To tell you what month
or what year it was,


786
00:53:07.999 --> 00:53:11.167
But tom was selected
as an employee of the month.


787
00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:14.170
And it was a pretty big deal.
You got a parking spot


788
00:53:14.305 --> 00:53:15.905
Right out in front
of the building


789
00:53:16.073 --> 00:53:18.541
And you got like a plaque,
and then there was a thing


790
00:53:18.743 --> 00:53:21.511
In the break room
that your name went on for,


791
00:53:21.679 --> 00:53:23.580
You know, perpetuity,
or at least until the company


792
00:53:23.782 --> 00:53:25.214
Goes out of business.

793
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:31.621
- Well, I was a poor
phd student.


794
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:35.358
And it struck me that he was
a man of moderate means as well.


795
00:53:35.493 --> 00:53:37.560
That seemed like
a perfect match.


796
00:53:37.695 --> 00:53:39.629
And before we knew it,
we had moved in.


797
00:53:40.865 --> 00:53:44.567
He moved in these enormous
wooden shelves, bookshelves,


798
00:53:44.769 --> 00:53:48.204
And filled the dining room wall
with bookshelves.


799
00:53:48.339 --> 00:53:49.872
And what followed
soon afterwards


800
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:53.810
Were piles of books and papers,
and a mysterious jar.


801
00:53:54.846 --> 00:53:57.146
And then, it all came out.

802
00:53:57.314 --> 00:53:59.282
And I suddenly realized
that I was probably


803
00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.918
One of the very few physics
students in history


804
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.854
That were living with
the god of physics' brain.


805
00:54:06.924 --> 00:54:10.460
It did suddenly appear one day
on the dining room table.


806
00:54:10.595 --> 00:54:12.095
And he would sit there
with the jar


807
00:54:12.229 --> 00:54:13.963
Right next to his breakfast.

808
00:54:17.234 --> 00:54:18.668
Like, can't imagine anybody

809
00:54:18.803 --> 00:54:21.137
Would dream of such thing
in their wildest dreams.


810
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.512
- As quakers, we tried
to be sort of quiet.


811
00:54:30.882 --> 00:54:34.384
I thought of tom as just
this quiet elderly man


812
00:54:34.552 --> 00:54:37.954
Who rode a bicycle
and who was kind and...


813
00:54:39.224 --> 00:54:43.726
Pleasant to be around,
quiet, he didn't say much.


814
00:54:44.229 --> 00:54:47.897
So I was... I was really
surprised, as time went on,


815
00:54:48.032 --> 00:54:50.500
When I found out more
about his past.


816
00:54:53.104 --> 00:54:56.572
- We often had parties together
and he was a real party animal.


817
00:54:57.408 --> 00:55:00.510
He was a lot of fun.
He could mix with any age group.


818
00:55:00.712 --> 00:55:03.112
He could mix with
any social class.


819
00:55:03.314 --> 00:55:05.114
He was a real quaker
in that respect,


820
00:55:05.316 --> 00:55:06.616
And he brought it to the party.

821
00:55:06.784 --> 00:55:08.551
Nothing like a quaker
at a party.


822
00:55:09.453 --> 00:55:11.254
He could drink people
under the table.


823
00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:14.390
He could laugh
and joke with anyone.


824
00:55:14.592 --> 00:55:16.259
He was fabulous to have around.

825
00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:20.530
- Tom did seem a bit
mysterious to me.


826
00:55:21.132 --> 00:55:23.066
Here was this older man
who rode a bicycle


827
00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:24.901
And worked at a plastics plant

828
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:27.670
Who'd been a chief pathologist
at princeton hospital.


829
00:55:27.872 --> 00:55:31.607
And it kind of didn't
seem to fit real well.


830
00:55:33.845 --> 00:55:38.014
And then, I learned that
not only had he done


831
00:55:38.216 --> 00:55:40.083
The autopsy on einstein,

832
00:55:40.285 --> 00:55:43.486
But that he possessed
einstein's brain.


833
00:55:43.688 --> 00:55:46.656
- I did not understand
how that...


834
00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:48.558
How having a dissected brain

835
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.494
Could further our
understanding of brains.


836
00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:53.229
So as a scientist,

837
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:55.498
I struggled to understand

838
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.601
How having one sample
could lead you


839
00:55:58.769 --> 00:56:01.104
To a theory of...

840
00:56:01.306 --> 00:56:02.572
The brain.

841
00:56:04.308 --> 00:56:06.442
- When I saw the brain,

842
00:56:06.644 --> 00:56:08.077
I was sort of unimpressed

843
00:56:08.212 --> 00:56:10.713
Because, again, I was expecting
to see the whole brain.


844
00:56:10.848 --> 00:56:13.216
And I just saw this little
piece of it.


845
00:56:13.418 --> 00:56:15.618
And so, it was like,
oh, it was not quite


846
00:56:15.753 --> 00:56:17.620
As impressive as I expected.

847
00:56:17.755 --> 00:56:20.857
I don't know what I was
expecting, actually.


848
00:56:20.992 --> 00:56:22.458
I guess when you think
of einstein's brain,


849
00:56:22.593 --> 00:56:24.293
You think of something
really marvelous,


850
00:56:24.461 --> 00:56:26.295
Like you've never seen before.

851
00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:30.266
And it was just like a specimen
in a specimen jar.


852
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:37.473
- One of the things that
everybody loved about tom,


853
00:56:37.608 --> 00:56:40.743
The guy never missed work.
I mean, never missed work.


854
00:56:40.878 --> 00:56:42.211
So...

855
00:56:42.413 --> 00:56:44.580
One day, I got a call
telling me that tom


856
00:56:44.748 --> 00:56:46.916
Was not going to be
at work that day.


857
00:56:47.084 --> 00:56:51.154
And I was told that he was
in a bicycle accident.


858
00:56:53.724 --> 00:56:57.460
He was hit, while on his bike,
was hit by a car


859
00:56:57.628 --> 00:57:00.396
That was driven
by a woman who...


860
00:57:00.531 --> 00:57:04.167
Oh, by the way, at the time,
he was 79 or 80.


861
00:57:04.369 --> 00:57:06.836
And she was one year older
than tom,


862
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:08.437
If you can imagine that.

863
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.906
So I've always kind of suspected

864
00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:11.974
That if guinness book
of world records


865
00:57:12.176 --> 00:57:15.978
Ever had a category
for "bike v. Car


866
00:57:16.113 --> 00:57:17.747
Accident combined age,"

867
00:57:17.915 --> 00:57:19.849
There's not doubt in my mind
that they would be


868
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:21.517
In the running for that one.

869
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:27.156
When tom did come back
to the line


870
00:57:27.324 --> 00:57:28.858
After the bicycle accident,

871
00:57:28.993 --> 00:57:33.296
I don't think I ever saw him
move without pain,


872
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:36.399
In the same way that I did
before the accident.


873
00:57:38.102 --> 00:57:40.002
He lost a little bit
of strength,


874
00:57:40.137 --> 00:57:43.873
And he was noticeably
less agile.


875
00:57:44.075 --> 00:57:47.777
I think he always moved
really well, um...


876
00:57:47.945 --> 00:57:53.216
And I think he just couldn't be
quite as pain-free after that.


877
00:57:54.452 --> 00:57:56.219
- Whenever he came back
from the factory,


878
00:57:56.387 --> 00:57:58.521
He was clearly exhausted.

879
00:57:58.656 --> 00:58:02.692
He was ashen with just...

880
00:58:02.894 --> 00:58:04.794
You know, mind-numbing
exhaustion.


881
00:58:04.996 --> 00:58:09.332
And it broke my heart
to see somebody of his age,


882
00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.968
And of his incredible abilities,

883
00:58:12.103 --> 00:58:13.803
Working away
at this kind of work.


884
00:58:16.641 --> 00:58:20.309
- He could have somehow
profited personally


885
00:58:20.477 --> 00:58:23.813
From his role as the keeper
of einstein's brain,


886
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:25.715
But he never did.

887
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.516
So he would turn down

888
00:58:27.652 --> 00:58:31.888
Big money offer interviews
from various media and tv shows.


889
00:58:32.056 --> 00:58:34.790
And yet, he would show
the brain to, you know,


890
00:58:34.993 --> 00:58:38.194
Sort of the rotary club members
or high school students


891
00:58:38.396 --> 00:58:40.763
Or, you know, fellow quakers.

892
00:58:40.931 --> 00:58:43.866
Or he wouldn't sell the brain.
He had offer, you know.


893
00:58:44.001 --> 00:58:45.735
People wanted to buy the brain,
and so on.


894
00:58:45.937 --> 00:58:49.672
But he would instead work like,
three, four, five jobs


895
00:58:49.874 --> 00:58:52.842
To make ends meet before
he thought about, you know,


896
00:58:52.977 --> 00:58:54.644
Taking any money for the brain.

897
00:58:56.214 --> 00:58:59.081
But at the same time,
he got so busy living


898
00:58:59.283 --> 00:59:03.052
That einstein's brain was this
thing on his to-do list


899
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:08.224
That slipped further and further
down the list.


900
00:59:23.007 --> 00:59:24.807
- Long trip from japan, huh?
- Yeah.


901
00:59:24.942 --> 00:59:26.275
- Very long.

902
00:59:27.178 --> 00:59:29.412
So what is the purpose
of your visit here?


903
00:59:29.546 --> 00:59:32.882
- I'm looking for
einstein's brain.


904
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:34.016
- Okay.

905
00:59:35.586 --> 00:59:37.553
- A couple years later,
there was a documentary


906
00:59:37.721 --> 00:59:39.121
That some guy did.

907
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:41.924
- Dr. Harvey's house

908
00:59:42.126 --> 00:59:44.794
Is just on the other side
of the creek.


909
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.763
- This physicist from japan

910
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:49.899
Was really very interested
in einstein.


911
00:59:50.067 --> 00:59:52.301
And harvey clearly liked him.
It was in kansas.


912
01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:04.113
Oh! Wow!

913
01:00:11.855 --> 01:00:12.955
oh!

914
01:00:13.157 --> 01:00:15.157
- His brain has been sectioned.

915
01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:18.160
- Oh!
- Cut into many pieces.


916
01:00:18.362 --> 01:00:20.296
As you see.

917
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.639
- Possible please give me...

918
01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:35.344
From photo, one piece
of einstein's brain?


919
01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:39.281
- And he says, "could I have
a piece of the brain?"


920
01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:40.816
And harvey...

921
01:00:40.951 --> 01:00:42.385
Harvey grabs
his mayonnaise jars


922
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.986
And cuts off a little bit
of the cerebellum


923
01:00:44.154 --> 01:00:45.888
With a kitchen knife.
I know he had a better knife.


924
01:00:46.023 --> 01:00:48.057
I think he had
a pathology knife.


925
01:00:48.259 --> 01:00:49.325
And gave him a bit.

926
01:00:49.493 --> 01:00:52.161
- Let me get this knife and...

927
01:00:52.296 --> 01:00:54.230
Cutting board.

928
01:01:04.876 --> 01:01:06.442
Okay...

929
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:10.579
- And slowly, it took on
some circus-like aspects


930
01:01:10.714 --> 01:01:12.415
That were exactly
the nightmare...


931
01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:15.584
- This is brain stem
and cerebellum.


932
01:01:15.752 --> 01:01:18.687
- ...That the einstein estate,

933
01:01:18.823 --> 01:01:20.923
And einstein himself I guess,

934
01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:22.925
Would never want to see.

935
01:01:23.794 --> 01:01:26.529
- Oh, thank you for this, sir.
- You're welcome.


936
01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:33.602
- Later on, it took on,
you know, kind of crazy aspects,


937
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:38.574
Maybe culminating in this one
trip some guy wrote a book about


938
01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:41.210
Going cross-country
with einstein's brain.


939
01:01:51.656 --> 01:01:54.457
I think it's driving mr. Albert
by paterniti


940
01:01:54.592 --> 01:01:56.025
Which was a great read,

941
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.527
But it really didn't do

942
01:01:58.729 --> 01:02:00.329
Anything great
for thomas harvey.


943
01:02:02.766 --> 01:02:06.936
Paterniti, you know,
went cross-country with a brain,


944
01:02:07.138 --> 01:02:09.605
With harvey and sort of
portrayed him as,


945
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.640
I don't even know
how he portrayed him.


946
01:02:12.877 --> 01:02:15.778
He got down to wichita
and he introduced him


947
01:02:15.946 --> 01:02:18.948
To william burroughs
of naked lunch fame.


948
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:20.983
And william burroughs...

949
01:02:21.118 --> 01:02:23.586
Harvey, who was this very,
to me,


950
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.822
Scholarly quaker quiet guy,

951
01:02:26.957 --> 01:02:31.460
And burroughs is saying,
"what's your addiction, doctor?"


952
01:02:31.628 --> 01:02:33.796
So that's in the book,
and... I mean,


953
01:02:33.964 --> 01:02:36.565
Those kind of things which make
for a very diverting reading,


954
01:02:36.767 --> 01:02:39.802
I don't think the family
was terribly thrilled with it.


955
01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:46.175
- And dr. Harvey, at that point,

956
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:50.212
Didn't seem really in possession
of his own story,


957
01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:51.981
But was just going with it.

958
01:02:54.484 --> 01:02:56.685
Maybe at that point
he just should've given it


959
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.955
To a research institution
and passed it on


960
01:03:00.123 --> 01:03:04.126
Instead of having
the brain loose out there


961
01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:06.128
And not under, you know,

962
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:10.799
The protection
of a scientific institute.


963
01:03:11.002 --> 01:03:13.502
And you know...

964
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:15.171
Less of a spectacle.

965
01:03:19.977 --> 01:03:23.379
- Tom was quite unfairly
portrayed in some media.


966
01:03:24.215 --> 01:03:26.815
I think there was the element
of the sort of freak show


967
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:29.685
About tom and his possession
of the brain.


968
01:03:31.255 --> 01:03:33.656
By and large, journalists
did not bother to find out


969
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.792
That aspect.
They immediately latched onto


970
01:03:36.927 --> 01:03:39.195
The circus element of it all.

971
01:03:39.397 --> 01:03:42.198
And almost abused it,
in a way.


972
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.768
And marketed it
as a brand.


973
01:03:58.982 --> 01:04:00.382
- Einstein has a bobble head.

974
01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:02.251
There's been lots of movies
about einstein.


975
01:04:02.386 --> 01:04:05.521
People have posters of einstein
in their room.


976
01:04:05.656 --> 01:04:07.156
I remember watching
a spiderman movie.


977
01:04:07.324 --> 01:04:08.691
And in the spiderman movie,

978
01:04:08.825 --> 01:04:12.328
There's a poster of einstein
on peter parker's wall.


979
01:04:12.463 --> 01:04:16.932
One of the reasons is because,
a: He personifies genius.


980
01:04:17.067 --> 01:04:21.370
And I think everybody,
across race, religion, culture,


981
01:04:21.538 --> 01:04:24.540
Republican, democrat,
right, left, old, young.


982
01:04:24.742 --> 01:04:28.077
It doesn't matter.
Everybody knows who einstein is.


983
01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:35.150
I live in the appalachian
mountains,


984
01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:37.386
And you know, I wake up
in the morning


985
01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:40.055
And get eggs from my chickens
and then I boot up my computer,


986
01:04:40.223 --> 01:04:43.525
And to the world I am
the digital avatar


987
01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.161
Of albert einstein.
It's pretty bananas.


988
01:04:50.568 --> 01:04:53.335
Believe it or not,
einstein is one of the few


989
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:56.805
Dead celebrities who has
a presence on social media.


990
01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.942
And he has 20 million followers

991
01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:03.445
On facebook,
instagram and twitter.


992
01:05:03.647 --> 01:05:05.381
More than most living
celebrities.


993
01:05:05.516 --> 01:05:07.583
More than tom hanks,
more than jennifer aniston.


994
01:05:07.718 --> 01:05:09.551
And... Yeah!

995
01:05:10.688 --> 01:05:13.522
I get all sorts of interesting
people try to direct message me


996
01:05:13.724 --> 01:05:15.024
On social media.

997
01:05:15.158 --> 01:05:17.159
I get teenagers in india

998
01:05:17.327 --> 01:05:19.161
Message me for help
with their math homework.


999
01:05:19.296 --> 01:05:20.829
I get physicists in florida

1000
01:05:20.997 --> 01:05:23.966
Who want to show me their new
scientific research paper.


1001
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:27.436
As if I can weigh in on it
in any meaningful way.


1002
01:05:27.604 --> 01:05:29.238
Well, I think you're missing
a comma over there.


1003
01:05:29.373 --> 01:05:31.240
Or I think that equation
is off.


1004
01:05:31.408 --> 01:05:32.841
I don't know what
they're thinking.


1005
01:05:33.009 --> 01:05:34.643
Maybe they just want a response,
a pat on the...


1006
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:36.245
A virtual, digital
pat on the shoulder


1007
01:05:36.413 --> 01:05:37.446
For their good work.

1008
01:05:41.085 --> 01:05:43.218
One of the first things I posted

1009
01:05:43.354 --> 01:05:45.654
When I took over the albert
einstein social media account


1010
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:47.956
Was the story about
thomas harvey


1011
01:05:48.092 --> 01:05:50.859
Stealing einstein's brain
in the morgue.


1012
01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:55.464
And it got one of the worst

1013
01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:58.867
Results ever on einstein's
social media.


1014
01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:00.936
People did not want to hear it.

1015
01:06:01.071 --> 01:06:03.672
These were fans who look up
to einstein,


1016
01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:05.274
He's a beloved character,

1017
01:06:05.409 --> 01:06:10.379
He's enshrined in their mind
as this perfect totem of genius,


1018
01:06:10.514 --> 01:06:12.014
And...

1019
01:06:12.182 --> 01:06:14.516
To hear the story
of thomas harvey


1020
01:06:14.718 --> 01:06:17.353
Violently taking the brain,

1021
01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:20.356
And the brain, and what it
represents for einstein.


1022
01:06:20.524 --> 01:06:22.224
It's not like he took
einstein's ear


1023
01:06:22.359 --> 01:06:23.826
Or a lock einstein's hair.

1024
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.729
Einstein's brain
is what he's famous for.


1025
01:06:26.864 --> 01:06:29.531
And this guy cracked open
his head,


1026
01:06:29.733 --> 01:06:32.634
Grabbed the brain
and stole it.


1027
01:06:32.803 --> 01:06:34.970
And when... Think about it.

1028
01:06:35.138 --> 01:06:36.672
Like, I wasn't thinking
when I posted it...


1029
01:06:36.874 --> 01:06:38.807
Here's a fan page
for albert einstein


1030
01:06:39.009 --> 01:06:41.143
With 20 million people
who love albert einstein.


1031
01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:44.480
I should've known better
how they were gonna respond.


1032
01:06:44.615 --> 01:06:45.881
It didn't get that many likes,

1033
01:06:46.016 --> 01:06:47.716
It got all these
negative comments.


1034
01:06:47.851 --> 01:06:50.719
"what are you doing?
We don't wanna hear about this."


1035
01:06:50.854 --> 01:06:52.888
Even the einstein archives
themselves were like,


1036
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.257
"could you please not post
about thomas harvey so much?"


1037
01:06:55.392 --> 01:06:58.394
It's one of the few blemishes
on einstein's legacy.


1038
01:07:51.748 --> 01:07:55.317
- I got the impression that
he was profoundly embarrassed


1039
01:07:55.452 --> 01:07:58.420
That he had not
produced the study.


1040
01:07:58.588 --> 01:08:00.622
He had sent it to many,
many people.


1041
01:08:01.758 --> 01:08:05.494
And one could argue
that at a certain point


1042
01:08:05.696 --> 01:08:10.232
He owed it to
the einstein family,


1043
01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:13.235
To the public,
maybe to einstein himself,


1044
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.038
To come up with what
he had at that moment.


1045
01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.209
And then, maybe throw it open
for other scientists.


1046
01:08:26.183 --> 01:08:29.418
- There was a canadian
researcher, sandra witelson,


1047
01:08:29.586 --> 01:08:31.854
Who had a very large collection
of normal brains,


1048
01:08:32.056 --> 01:08:33.522
Which is, you know,
highly unusual


1049
01:08:33.724 --> 01:08:35.824
And very precious
in brain research.


1050
01:08:35.959 --> 01:08:39.728
And so, one day, she received
a one-page fax


1051
01:08:39.863 --> 01:08:42.831
That came out of the blue
into her office


1052
01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:45.234
That simply said,
"would you like to study


1053
01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:47.736
The brain of albert einstein?"

1054
01:08:52.676 --> 01:08:54.142
Tom told me this story

1055
01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:57.546
Of having packed the brain
into the trunk of his dodge.


1056
01:08:58.348 --> 01:09:02.718
And driving up to canada

1057
01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:05.954
And crossing at niagara falls
at midnight.


1058
01:09:07.824 --> 01:09:10.058
And trying to declare

1059
01:09:10.226 --> 01:09:12.961
The brain of albert einstein
at customs.


1060
01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:15.564
and the customs officers

1061
01:09:15.766 --> 01:09:17.366
Had said, you know,

1062
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:18.867
"do you have anything
to declare?"


1063
01:09:19.002 --> 01:09:20.402
He tells them what he has.

1064
01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:22.971
I suspect they did not
believe him


1065
01:09:23.106 --> 01:09:26.942
Because he said they didn't ask
to see it or anything.


1066
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.644
So...

1067
01:09:29.512 --> 01:09:31.547
He just drove straight through

1068
01:09:31.681 --> 01:09:34.783
And he delivered a certain
portion of the brain


1069
01:09:34.985 --> 01:09:37.252
To sandra witelson in hamilton.

1070
01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:44.526
You know, she describes
holding it in her hands


1071
01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:47.329
And feeling a sense of awe.

1072
01:09:48.398 --> 01:09:51.166
You know, you think scientists
are somehow immune


1073
01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:54.236
To the kind of mystical
hocus-pocus


1074
01:09:54.404 --> 01:09:56.338
That goes around
when we think about


1075
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.941
The body parts of famous people,

1076
01:09:59.143 --> 01:10:01.043
But they're not.
And I think that that's one


1077
01:10:01.177 --> 01:10:02.711
Of the interesting things
about science,


1078
01:10:02.879 --> 01:10:05.581
Is that it tries
to be objective,


1079
01:10:05.749 --> 01:10:10.485
It tries to transcend all
of the other foibles


1080
01:10:10.621 --> 01:10:12.688
That mark the human condition.

1081
01:10:12.823 --> 01:10:16.191
But it can never
because it's driven by people.


1082
01:10:16.326 --> 01:10:17.859
And we are all flawed.

1083
01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.497
- She wrote this paper
about the exceptional brain


1084
01:10:22.633 --> 01:10:23.865
Of albert einstein.

1085
01:10:24.034 --> 01:10:26.835
And, I'm gonna do her
a disservice,


1086
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:30.505
But say that she really focused
on the parietal lobe,


1087
01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.140
Albert einstein's parietal lobe

1088
01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:34.343
Which, when she studied
the photographs,


1089
01:10:34.477 --> 01:10:38.447
She found anatomical anomalies.

1090
01:10:38.649 --> 01:10:40.616
- Neuroscientist sandra witelson

1091
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.318
Has just finished peering
into one of the greatest minds


1092
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.420
Of the 20th century.

1093
01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:48.390
- The width of the brain,
from left to right,


1094
01:10:48.592 --> 01:10:52.394
Was larger by 15 percent,
in einstein's brain,


1095
01:10:52.529 --> 01:10:54.062
Compared to the control group.

1096
01:10:55.598 --> 01:10:57.332
- I remember her describing it
at the time


1097
01:10:57.534 --> 01:11:00.002
And saying, to her,
it was as obvious


1098
01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:03.905
As seeing eyebrows misplaced
on the face.


1099
01:11:04.074 --> 01:11:07.509
And that's how different
this one particular fissure


1100
01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:09.945
In einstein's brain was.

1101
01:11:10.547 --> 01:11:14.216
And it so happens that
the regions of the brain


1102
01:11:14.418 --> 01:11:17.886
That this fissure separates
generally in people


1103
01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:22.090
Are involved in mathematical
and visual, spatial reasoning,


1104
01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:25.060
Which really correlates
to the way einstein


1105
01:11:25.228 --> 01:11:28.230
Used to think,
or describe his thinking,


1106
01:11:28.432 --> 01:11:30.732
Which he said, he didn't think
in terms of numbers.


1107
01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:33.935
It wasn't math
that he envisioned


1108
01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:38.473
When he conducted
his thought experiments,


1109
01:11:38.608 --> 01:11:41.410
But rather he would actually
see himself,


1110
01:11:41.578 --> 01:11:45.313
Be able to imagine himself
riding on a beam of light.


1111
01:11:47.183 --> 01:11:50.919
So, you know, when sandra
witelson completed her study,


1112
01:11:51.054 --> 01:11:53.455
She said, you know,
maybe this explains


1113
01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:54.956
Why he thought in images,

1114
01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:59.761
Why he had such
a fertile lab for a mind.


1115
01:12:02.499 --> 01:12:06.068
She felt that she had located,
to some extent,


1116
01:12:06.203 --> 01:12:10.138
The source of what made
his mind so extraordinary.


1117
01:12:16.746 --> 01:12:18.914
Then, after witelson's study,

1118
01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:21.983
Fred lepore and his research
partner dean falk,


1119
01:12:22.152 --> 01:12:24.286
Came out with a big study
of their own.


1120
01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:27.089
And I think tom would've felt
vindicated for all the years


1121
01:12:27.223 --> 01:12:28.790
He kept the brain.

1122
01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:30.926
- Witelson just stopped
at the parietal lobe.


1123
01:12:31.128 --> 01:12:33.195
But we found every lobe:

1124
01:12:33.397 --> 01:12:35.597
Frontal lobe, parietal lobe,

1125
01:12:35.765 --> 01:12:37.799
Occipital lobe,
cingulate lobe...


1126
01:12:37.967 --> 01:12:39.601
Everything was different.

1127
01:12:39.803 --> 01:12:41.636
That is not standard issue,

1128
01:12:41.839 --> 01:12:43.004
That frontal lobe.

1129
01:12:43.173 --> 01:12:46.141
- So one more makes a big
difference, okay, got it.


1130
01:12:47.511 --> 01:12:49.244
- Extraordinary,
never-before-seen pictures


1131
01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:51.780
Of albert einstein's brain
have just been revealed


1132
01:12:51.982 --> 01:12:54.549
And they could provide clues
about how he came to be


1133
01:12:54.717 --> 01:12:56.952
One of the greatest geniuses
of all-time.


1134
01:12:57.154 --> 01:13:00.288
- And now, people can study
his brain in detail


1135
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:01.957
Through modern technology.

1136
01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:05.861
There's an ipad app which has
detailed three-dimensional


1137
01:13:06.063 --> 01:13:08.130
Images of einstein's brain.

1138
01:13:08.332 --> 01:13:09.664
- I wanna see that.

1139
01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.392
- I mean, he was no hero.

1140
01:14:10.594 --> 01:14:14.996
But I don't think he did
anything with evil intentions.


1141
01:14:16.532 --> 01:14:18.834
- I'm sure he had regrets,
we all have regrets.


1142
01:14:19.036 --> 01:14:22.103
But he was always
about doing the right thing.


1143
01:14:23.273 --> 01:14:25.974
- I think history
has been unfair to him.


1144
01:14:26.176 --> 01:14:29.110
He wanted to be thought
of as a scientist.


1145
01:14:30.046 --> 01:14:34.516
- He didn't want to use
the brain for fame's sake.


1146
01:14:34.651 --> 01:14:38.119
But he did hope that by doing
right by the brain,


1147
01:14:38.254 --> 01:14:42.123
It would make him famous
in a scientific sense.


1148
01:14:43.093 --> 01:14:46.061
He did not leave this earth
a wealthy man.


1149
01:14:46.797 --> 01:14:51.299
But he left this earth
with his integrity


1150
01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:53.969
And knowing he always did
the best he could for people.


1151
01:14:55.872 --> 01:14:58.039
- I think it cost him a lot.

1152
01:14:58.174 --> 01:14:59.741
Would that same sequence
of events,


1153
01:14:59.943 --> 01:15:01.910
Would he've had
marriages that'd go south


1154
01:15:02.045 --> 01:15:03.411
Without einstein's brain,

1155
01:15:03.579 --> 01:15:06.114
Would they have kindly
inclined to him as a part


1156
01:15:06.249 --> 01:15:07.649
Of the medical center
of princeton?


1157
01:15:07.784 --> 01:15:09.184
We're never gonna know.

1158
01:15:10.587 --> 01:15:12.354
- I got interested
in albert einstein


1159
01:15:12.522 --> 01:15:14.456
Because I was in college
reading a book


1160
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:16.124
That was like, "oh, my god,

1161
01:15:16.259 --> 01:15:18.793
Somebody stole
einstein's brain."


1162
01:15:18.929 --> 01:15:21.730
And that story itself,
if that story gets people


1163
01:15:21.932 --> 01:15:23.832
Interested in albert einstein,
there's something positive


1164
01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:25.400
To be said about that.

1165
01:15:28.805 --> 01:15:30.338
- Do we know where
the brain is now?


1166
01:15:30.473 --> 01:15:32.540
- No. No, you don't.

1167
01:15:32.743 --> 01:15:34.809
And you're not gonna find out.

1168
01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:40.815
If you call medical centre
in princeton, they say,


1169
01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:43.351
"well, that's under
the care of dr. X."


1170
01:15:46.556 --> 01:15:52.127
I don't blame dr. X about being
concerned about publicity.


1171
01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:06.041
- These are the original jars
that dr. Harvey


1172
01:16:06.243 --> 01:16:09.511
Placed all the brain parts
in back in 1955


1173
01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:12.347
When he did the autopsy
and dissected the brain.


1174
01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:16.084
It is a heavy responsibility.

1175
01:16:16.252 --> 01:16:18.153
Dr. Harvey understood that.

1176
01:16:18.287 --> 01:16:21.323
He carried it with him
for most of his adult life.


1177
01:16:21.458 --> 01:16:24.993
And after he ceded the brain,

1178
01:16:25.195 --> 01:16:27.028
I think he was somewhat relieved

1179
01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:29.164
Not to have to worry
about it anymore,


1180
01:16:29.332 --> 01:16:31.466
That someone else was taking
over the helm,


1181
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:33.535
That the person who was
taking it over


1182
01:16:33.737 --> 01:16:36.705
Had sufficient respect
for this material.


1183
01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:41.042
It was never meant
to be a museum piece.


1184
01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:43.578
It was never meant to sit
on a shelf


1185
01:16:43.713 --> 01:16:45.413
For people to gawk at.

1186
01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:48.350
It was to be used
for scientific purposes.


1187
01:16:48.485 --> 01:16:51.286
And I think that,

1188
01:16:51.488 --> 01:16:54.522
At least as far as we have been
able to go with the science,


1189
01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.158
We've kept true to that spirit.

1190
01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.460
Hopefully, in the future,

1191
01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:00.261
We'll be able to do
more with it.


1192
01:17:01.864 --> 01:17:04.733
It sounds silly to have
a heavy responsibility,


1193
01:17:04.867 --> 01:17:07.869
But it is einstein's brain.
It's not nothing.


1194
01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:10.105
It is einstein's brain.

1195
01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:43.338
Subtitling: Difuze
