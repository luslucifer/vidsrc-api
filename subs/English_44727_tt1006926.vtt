5
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.490
<b>Pull in the sails!</b>

6
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.500
<b>Damn it! It was such a beautiful weather
just a while ago , what happened so suddenly?</b>

7
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.300
<b>It can't be helped, after all
we are on the mysterious Grand Line.</b>

8

<b>This furious storm is capable of damaging our ship. 
Good thing I already gave orders to take extra precautions.</b>

<b>The pirate ships are likely having same troubles , 
What's the situation of our fuel?</b>

10
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.010
<b>I already sent men to
deal with the fuel reserves.</b>

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.220
<b>And what about the pirate
ship , where is it?</b>

12
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.170
<b>It's in front of starboard,
ten'o clock, distance 800 meters.</b>

<b>Damn…</b>

20

<b>Why aren't they sinked or captured yet?</b>

21
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420
<b>Due to the small size of their boat
, they are moving really fast using currents.</b>

22
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.040
<b>At this rate they are gonna get away..</b>

23

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.780
<b>Its same as you heard.</b>

34
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.550
<b>According to our sources, the pirates are gathering.</b>

35
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.850
<b>Why are they gathering...?</b>

36
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.860
<b>Can you handle it or
is it too much for you?</b>

37
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.510
<b>Is this some kind of race...?</b>

38
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.690
<b>I believe so.</b>

39
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
<b>Well, we located another pirate

<b>Exactly , the shame of navy.</b>

46

<b>So got anything?</b>

<b>No , its impossible
to work here for money..</b>

71
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.610
<b>What should we do...</b>

72
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.810
<b>What are you saying?
Hey! As I am Captain,</b>


73
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.730
<b>I must complain that you
all spend too much money!</b>

74
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.910
<b>We don't wanna hear it from
you who wasted every penny on food!</b>

<b>ehhh really?</b>

76
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.740
<b>But it's a really big problem..</b>

77
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.090
<b>Well it's nothing , i
m sure we'll find some way..</b>

78
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.610
<b>But we can't earn money here
, we should go to next island.</b>

79
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.410
<b>Is something the matter?</b>

80
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.860
<b>A rum, please.</b>

81
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.350
<b>Thank you.</b>

82
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.900
<b>This island, this is Shinabalu, right?</b>

83
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.170
<b>Yes.</b>

84
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.700
<b>You... Return me my....</b>

85
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.060
<b>It's mine..</b>

86

<b>I won't give it
to you without a fight!</b>

87
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.320
<b>I told you to
stop doing that! , Idiot.</b>

88
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.410
<b>Nami-san, is there something?</b>

89
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.700
<b>No nothing…</b>

90
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.030
<b>I think that the guy who
just went in is a pirate.</b>

91
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.660
<b>and he made a
strange trade with the bartender.</b>

92
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.330
<b>Zoro, what are you implying?</b>

93
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.340
<b>It can't be a conicidence.</b>

94
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.210
<b>with what just happened.</b>

95
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.220
<b>They went in there , right?</b>

96
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.620
<b>I am not an idiot like them!
You also smelled the odor(scent) of money right?</b>


97
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.590
<b>What? You are calling me a Money Worshipper?</b>

98
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.200
<b>Is that wrong?
Do not insult Nami-san!</b>


99
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.630
<b>Well thats true , 
I Like Money and Oranges best in the world!</b>

100
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.720
<b>I can't be wrong about them.</b>

101
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.380
<b>Luffy, Ussop, Chopper!
 We are going for adventure.</b>


102
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.370
<b>Its not the time to fight among yourselves.</b>

103
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.910
<b>Hey, I have shortage of money.</b>

104
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.100
<b>And just in case , you wouldn't know
of a way to get a lot of money,right?</b>

105
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.540
<b>Don't worry , we can
pay you a considerate amount.</b>

106
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.690
<b>With a Little Interest if you want.</b>

107
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.200
<b>you are one cheeky gambler.</b>

108
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.100
<b>I am also a pirate.</b>

109
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.780
<b>I already have the impression
that you were somewhat strange.</b>

110
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.820
<b>I surely have something, but it risks dying.</b>

111
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.690
<b>Well you're right , we may die.</b>

112
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.490
<b>But its better than to mourn.</b>

113
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:38.380
<b>Like we can never know if there is a
tiger in a cave unless we see for ourselves.</b>

114
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.000
<b>It's perhaps our chance,</b>

115
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.920
<b>to find a treasure
which isn't easy to obtain.</b>

116
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.160
<b>So if one wants to
avoid the surprising risks ,</b>

117
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.430
<b>then it's necessary to prepare
for all kinds of risks.</b>

118
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.980
<b>With a risk like that its
likely to have a lot of reward.</b>

119
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.360
<b>Come to think of it ,
we are always risking our lives.</b>

120
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.890
<b>But that wont matter..</b>

121
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.270
<b>because my partners are already
prepared because of the money problem.</b>

122
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.490
<b>They won't give up due to
small danger , especially the Captain.</b>

123
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.040
<b>Now , please tell me where is it?</b>

124
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.050
<b>The Place which reeks of Gold?</b>

125
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.980
<b>You truly are the
most idiotic pirates I've met.</b>

126
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.570
<b>Who is he calling idiot?</b>

127
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
<b>It is you, Zoro?</b>

128
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.620
<b>He's calling us Idiot!</b>

129
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.800
<b>Follow me.</b>

130
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.810
<b>yeah!!</b>

131
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.410
<b>Close the door, quickly!</b>

132
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.980
<b>Is this a tunnel?</b>

133
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.300
<b>Continue walking straight.</b>

134
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.880
<b>Where?</b>

135
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.600
<b>Continue walking straight and you'll arrive there shortly.</b>

136
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.150
<b>Wait! You didn't tell us anything!</b>

137
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.960
<b>Exactly.</b>

138
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.290
<b>I can't go any further. 
You will know of it when you reach the end.</b>

139
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.640
<b>Isn't it exciting?</b>

140
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.590
<b>Luffy, idiot, this surely is a trap!</b>

141
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.100
<b>It would make things easy
for me if you give up.</b>

142
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.940
<b>Oi lets go there , 
I am curious to know whats there!</b>

143
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.590
<b>Oh really? Curious?</b>

144
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.410
<b>Are there really valuable things at the end?</b>

145
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.060
<b>I am not lying but
i can't say anything more either.</b>

146
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.940
<b>I don't like the sound of that.</b>

147
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.570
<b>Ussop, Give up already , once our captain decides
a thing , its impossible to change his decision.</b>

148
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.880
<b>And ofcourse there is that we don't have
any money , so we need to go there.</b>

149
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.550
<b>I really don't like the sound of this.</b>

150
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.980
<b>Is it really fun where we are going?</b>

151
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.860
<b>Ouais!</b>

152
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.120
<b>Well we'll think of a
way once we reach there.</b>

153
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.650
<b>Then , Let's Goo!
 Adventure is waiting for us!</b>


154
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.390
<b>This is clearly suspicious.</b>

155
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.510
<b>When you reach there , pay two
hundred belly , thats a payment to pass.</b>

156
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.090
<b>Thank you Oldman!</b>

157
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.560
<b>One more thing.</b>

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.500
<b>What?</b>

159
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.640
<b>Why did you become a pirate?</b>

160
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.400
<b>To Become The Pirate King</b>

161
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.190
<b>And then… we are also free ,</b>

162
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.110
<b>We can find lots of adventures waiting for us. 
Its really interesting.</b>

163
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.860
<b>Especially with a crew like that..</b>

164
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.610
<b>Then I wish you Good Luck. 
Try and Survive!</b>

165
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.980
<b>What?</b>

166
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.010
<b>No, nothing.</b>

167
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.430
<b>Ah!! It's hot!!</b>

168
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.450
<b>Zoro , What are you doing!?</b>

169
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.980
<b>Who is that?</b>

170
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.830
<b>Sanji-kun, wait!</b>

171
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.530
<b>Zoro, you are blocking the passage.</b>

172
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.380
<b>Sheathe your sword.  
I have something for you.</b>

173
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.490
<b>What is with this place?!</b>

174
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.270
<b>There is a ship stuck on the ceiling.</b>

175
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.720
<b>Its really hot in here!</b>

176
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.620
<b>What is with that?</b>

177
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.050
<b>Why is the ship up there?</b>

178
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.910
<b>Oy , Miss!</b>

179
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.700
<b>Do you want to be bet upon?</b>

180
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.830
<b>Bet?</b>

181
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.630
<b>You are not here for the race?</b>

182
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.300
<b>Oh? A race?</b>

183
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.520
<b>Don't think about it … you
won't be able to beat me anyway.</b>

184
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.300
<b>Oh so it was here.</b>

185
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.390
<b>Now I remember I came
here before and entered the race.</b>

186
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.200
<b>ehhh… what? Tell us!</b>

187
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.160
<b>I already came here once and joined
the race with a group of Pirates.</b>

188
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.570
<b>Although this race doesn't have fixed date.</b>

189
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.010
<b>The Pirates Decided to organize this event , Dead
-End Race!</b>

190
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.130
<b>Organized by the pirates?</b>

191
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.010
<b>This city was always populated
by the pirates in the past.</b>

192
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.070
<b>Ah… I see...</b>

193
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.490
<b>The pirates who took part
in race started from here.</b>

194
00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.720
<b>The race was very long.</b>

195
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.570
<b>The rules are very simple.
The first who passes the finishing line wins.</b>


196
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.580
<b>At the end whoever wins ,
will get a reward from here.</b>

197
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.900
<b>That is if everything went well..</b>

198
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.900
<b>That seems simple.</b>

199
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.690
<b>Its only a race..?</b>

200
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.920
<b>This seems like some kind of competition.</b>

201
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.830
<b>I don't think we'll have much problem.</b>

202
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.360
<b>And then Luffy really seems interested in it.</b>

203
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.440
<b>Hey, which ones take part in race?
You know it?</b>

That's approximately 300.000 people.</b>

205
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.920
<b>Woa! There are really many people.</b>

206
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.670
<b>Down ,  There are people
from the people from third continent.</b>

207
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.450
<b>They made a party of Giants to take part
in race , they are called Bobbi and Boggo.</b>

208
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.780
<b>Ah they are taking part in it too?</b>

<b>Hey Luffy.
Tell me you wont take part in the race , right?</b>


215
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.640
<b>We can't win against these guys</b>

216
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.730
<b>We'll get nothing!
 Are you listening to me!??</b>


217
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.240
<b>So what's the reward money?</b>

 Its a race and I didn't saw any ship docked here.</b>


233
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.070
<b>Were you the one who docked
the ship in middle of the port?</b>

234
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.510
<b>Sounds like our ship.</b>

235
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.470
<b>Are you trying to get all of us into trouble? 
Everyone camouflaged their ship to hide from Navy.</b>

236
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.440
<b>Grandpa! , Grandpa!

<b>Why are you saying you're fine?</b>

239
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.840
<b>You have been having this
fever for a week now!</b>

240
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.570
<b>It's nothing , you
shouldn't be concerned about it.</b>

<b>You know him, Robin?</b>

256
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.290
<b>Ah, I am not really sure.</b>

257
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.080
<b>I wonder of who he was again...?</b>

258
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.760
<b>Ah, where are the
others, what are they doing?</b>

<b>Still eating.</b>

<b>Didn't you eat a while ago?</b>

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.540
<b>It's hardly 6 hours.</b>

<b>Full with energy.</b>

267
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.250
<b>You don't need to.</b>

268
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.800
<b>Really?</b>

269
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.790
<b>It smells good , give me some!</b>

270

<b>This place is wonderful.

<b>You are really a Glouton.
 Glouton : A Creature who Gulps Everything Maybe??</b>


277
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.260
<b>Why did you do that?</b>

278
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.860
<b>Why I did that??! 
Why I did that…</b>

279
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.210
<b>It should be me the one saying that!</b>

280
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.340
<b>What do you mean?!</b>

281
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.280
<b>Shut up! I am talking about you
stealing the food by stretching your hands!</b>

282
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.390
<b>Though I don't know how you did that..</b>

283
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.710
<b>My hands…?</b>

284
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.400
<b>You aren't the one?</b>

285
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.700
<b>It wasn't us..</b>

286
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.110
<b>Yosh..
 I was the one who did that.</b>


287
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.130
<b>You ate the Devil's Fruit?</b>

288
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.070
<b>So?</b>

289
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.870
<b>Is there a problem with that?</b>

290
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.380
<b>Guess who's showing off , you
were the ones to steal our food!</b>

291

<b>Don't act stupid like

<b>We are crewmates of Captain Gasparde.</b>

<b>We will make you a trophy.</b>

295

<b>What do you want?
You want to apologize?</b>


296

<b>Hey, you still have to fight against me!</b>

<b>Bastard, what the hell are you made of?!</b>

312
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.540
<b>Yeah!!</b>

<b>Why did you save him?</b>

350
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.590
<b>I just felt like saving him…</b>

<b>I don't have the right to be here?</b>

361
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.960
<b>I didn't meant that....
It was just that you said that you'll drink on ship.</b>


362
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.120
<b>So you mean to say

<b>I don't know you.</b>

371
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:09.020
<b>Nobody in my crew which

372
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.570
<b>… by a insect as him.</b>

<b>What was that?</b>

376
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.440
<b>Something Fell Down.</b>

377
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.050
<b>Waste of time.</b>

378
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.150
<b>What??
Isn't that Captain Gasparde?</b>


379
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.890
<b>You seems rather skillful.
Who are you?</b>


380
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:49.010
<b>My name is Shuraya.
 I am a Bounty Hunter.</b>


381
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.260
<b>Shuraya?</b>

382
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.130
<b>Is that really?</b>

<b>He is Shuraya?</b>

386
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.380
<b>Oh you're quite famous , Mr. 
Bounty hunter</b>

387
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.240
<b>I am not that famous around here yet/</b>

388
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.050
<b>You don't seem like the guy
to be worth 30 million bounty.</b>

389
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.720
<b>You are rather extraordinary. 
Its interesting.</b>

390
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.350
<b>So how about it? 
Want to work for me?</b>


391
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.240
<b>Hey, I am only here to capture you.</b>

392
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.660
<b>I am already aware that
you met Navy on the way.</b>

393
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.220
<b>If you can fight, that is enough for me.
I love skillful people.</b>

<b>Thank you for your compliments.</b>

395

<b>So, What do you think about it?</b>

396
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.840
<b>No way.</b>

397
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.050
<b>This person is evil.</b>

398
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.520
<b>My hat…</b>

399
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.330
<b>Don't hate me for that ,
 You shouldn't insult me.</b>


400
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.390
<b>As you want.
But what will honor be for if you don't have the life to live for?</b>


401
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.550
<b>If you change your mind , 
Come and meet me on my ship.</b>

402
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.030
<b>We should hold the fun for the competition.</b>

403
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.880
<b>Look where you put your feet!!</b>

404
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.260
<b>Move! Don't touch it!</b>

405
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.320
<b>It's my treasure!</b>

406
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.880
<b>This hat is your treasure?</b>

407
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.590
<b>It's a very important and
precious hat which Shanks gave me.</b>

408
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.010
<b>Shanks? You know that Extraordinary Pirate?</b>

409
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.120
<b>yes.</b>

410
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.980
<b>You really are an interesting pirate.</b>

411
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.250
<b>Thats because I will become the Pirate King!</b>

412
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.200
<b>And I will find one piece.</b>

413
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.330
<b>But looks like all those
who know about it are</b>

414
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.920
<b>dead.</b>

415
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.300
<b>You are very spirited.</b>

416
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.430
<b>Do you know what would happen if
you say something like that in open ocean?</b>

417
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.390
<b>Don't care , because I
decided to become a pirate.</b>

418
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.410
<b>If I die in the way
of my ambition , then that's that.</b>

419
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.150
<b>Heh You are one small arrogant Brat.</b>

420

<b>He's sick and really old

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.710
<b>Shut up!</b>

459
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.140
<b>Let him do it.</b>

460
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.610
<b>He seems very spirited , he may have the
gut to kill , but he is also very stupid.</b>

461
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.550
<b>If you kill this certain person , 
I will let you join the crew.</b>

462
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.590
<b>Really?</b>

463
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.290
<b>Only insane would do that for his relative.</b>

464
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.280
<b>Hang in there Grandpa , 
I will be back with medicine soon!</b>

465
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.650
<b>Oy , is it done?</b>

466
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.390
<b>It is.</b>

467
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.370
<b>It really does point towards the mountain.</b>

468
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.780
<b>What's wrong , Nami?</b>

469
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.330
<b>This Eternal poses points
in direction of that mountain.</b>

470
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.840
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

471
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.110
<b>He said that this city
would be the starting point.</b>

472
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.090
<b>Are we lost?.
 So says the Zoro.</b>


473
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.370
<b>The hell.</b>

474
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.220
<b>What's wrong?</b>

475
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.050
<b>We are on the right place
, the starting point is here.</b>

476
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.130
<b>There are a lot of
currents going inland and outland both.</b>

477
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.790
<b>I think everyone took different streams or currents.</b>

478
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.380
<b>But all the inland streams go towards the...</b>

479
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:18.940
<b>They must be preparing
somewhere else on the island.</b>

480
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.040
<b>Wait , you meant we have
to go to the top of mountain?</b>

481
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.240
<b>Exactly. Once we reach there ,
we'll see the rest of the way.</b>

482
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.690
<b>But where does all these currents originate from?</b>

483
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.690
<b>Several years ago, there was an eruption here.</b>

484
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.820
<b>and so many streams were formed
, making the way towards the mountain.</b>

485
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.450
<b>Ahh, Robin-chan you are really informative</b>

486
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.730
<b>I understand your point...</b>

487
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.270
<b>It seems like we
have to start from here..</b>

488
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.720
<b>It doesn't look so.</b>

489
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:49.220
<b>Will we really be okay?
The last time we went on something like this it turned out bad..</b>


490
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.540
<b>It's Okay.
Things will turn out fine.</b>


491
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.450
<b>The wind...</b>

492
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.600
<b>Luffy, unload the sail!
Ussop, take the rudder!</b>


493
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.510
<b>Robin, keep an eye out on the backside , 
Zoro and Sanji, look on both sides for any dangers.</b>

494
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.340
<b>Here it comes!</b>

495
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.930
<b>we are almost flying!!</b>

496
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.850
<b>Yosh! Go!!!</b>

497
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:17.280
<b>I see, so this is what he
meant by race will start from here.</b>

498
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.020
<b>Looks like we are pretty popular.</b>

499
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.910
<b>Yosh, Leave it to us!</b>

500
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.040
<b>Be careful if you come my way!</b>

501
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.980
<b>If you come in my way , 
I'll kill you!</b>

502
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.380
<b>Well it seems normal now.</b>

503
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.070
<b>So who is this Gasparde?</b>

504
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.010
<b>You are interested in him?</b>

505
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.930
<b>You sure spent your time finding about him.</b>

506
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.680
<b>wow, this stream really will take
us on the top of mountain?</b>

507
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.350
<b>Its just the start , you know?</b>

508
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.900
<b>You have yet to beat Gasparde,
its because of him I'm here?</b>

509
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.280
<b>Really?</b>

510
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.840
<b>I can see the other ships.</b>

511
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.620
<b>There are also on this side too.</b>

512
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.710
<b>That one is huge.</b>

513
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.950
<b>Steam Engine? 
It's the first time that I see any ship using it.</b>


514
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.930
<b>That's the ship of Gasparde. ''
Salamander''</b>

515
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.030
<b>Is that...</b>

516
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.130
<b>That is the symbol of that ship?</b>

517
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.890
<b>Doesn't it resemble the navy logo?</b>

518
00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:27.280
<b>Well the story is as follows , 
Gasparde was a Navy once and then somehow he changed into a Pirate and took the same ship he ordered as his own.</b>

519
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.710
<b>Now, his bounty is 90 million berry.</b>

520
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.850
<b>90 million…
Thats really a lot of money.</b>


521
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.320
<b>It's certainly true.
And all that with his brute force.</b>


522
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.730
<b>There also seems to be rumour
that he ate the Devil;s Fruit.</b>

523
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.940
<b>Formerly he was Vice Admiral
Once , but not anymore now.</b>

524
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.230
<b>Is it a good news?
 He is a pirate now , right?</b>


525
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.910
<b>No its not…</b>

526
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.950
<b>Luffy…</b>

527
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.660
<b>I hate him.</b>

528
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.420
<b>Look at that , 
A funny little ship..</b>

529
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.680
<b>You really believe that
it can ride the currents?</b>

530
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.760
<b>That's the ship of Bigaro, with a tail.</b>

531
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.170
<b>He's Certainly Powerful.</b>

532
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.130
<b>That's one huge ship!</b>

533
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.340
<b>We are really going up!</b>

534
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.580
<b>Its okay , Nothing will happen…</b>

535
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.930
<b>I believe that we should prepare
ourselves for the worst case scenario.</b>

536
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.310
<b>Was that Grand Fall?</b>

537
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.340
<b>Young Navigator , it is not
the time to be taking easy yet.</b>

538
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.070
<b>Why are they destroying each other?!</b>

539
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.740
<b>The race has started.</b>

540
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.830
<b>Everything is allowed!</b>

541
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.220
<b>Ussop, Take care of
the one in the back!</b>

542
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.040
<b>Ahh… me?</b>

543
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.910
<b>Move out of the way!!</b>

544
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.720
<b>It doesn't seem well.</b>

545
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.140
<b>Okay I got it., 
I'll take care of it.</b>

546
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.130
<b>Really…</b>

547
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.030
<b>Fire!!</b>

548
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.560
<b>Yosh! Ussop the Man
is in the race now!</b>

549
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.280
<b>Everyone is battling, 
 It seems really fun!</b>


550
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.400
<b>Bobbi, we cannot make the turn at current speed!
Why don't we accelerate?</b>


551
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.000
<b>You are right.</b>

552
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.960
<b>Oh no!! We won't make it!</b>

553
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.750
<b>Chopper, turns the rudder to back!!</b>

554
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.110
<b>I am already doing it 
But it doesn't seem that it will work.</b>


555
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.930
<b>We won't make the turn at this pace.</b>

556
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.150
<b>Isn't there another way?</b>

557
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.840
<b>We should do something..</b>

558
00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.320
<b>Then do it!!</b>

559
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.060
<b>Ah, yes!</b>

560
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.270
<b>Luffy..</b>

561
00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.290
<b>Luffy!</b>

562
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.830
<b>But… what should we do now?</b>

563
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.960
<b>Million Fluer!</b>

564
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.790
<b>Hey Luffy!!!</b>

565
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.180
<b>Seems like we got through it somehow</b>

566
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.990
<b>I am glad we are all okay.</b>

567
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.140
<b>Robin, thank you, it was my fault,
I made a  mistake in my calculations.</b>


568
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.280
<b>Liar!</b>

569
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.980
<b>Well I am looking forward for this journey.</b>

570
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.480
<b>Let's make this race a fun adventure guys.</b>

571
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.410
<b>We have just started ,
we can't back down now.</b>

572
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.600
<b>For it puts our
pride as pirate to ground.</b>

573
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.600
<b>If we win , 
I will get all the 3 million belly for myself.</b>

574
00:40:53.610 --> 00:41:03.610
<b>I think I am getting some '' i can't
go on any further on this adventure '' disease.</b>

575
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.560
<b>Very well!</b>

576
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.760
<b>Shut up man.</b>

577
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.970
<b>The bounty hunter is responsible for me being here , 
We are gonna rot here for the rest of our lives.</b>

578
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.780
<b>Thats certainly shameful and awkward.</b>

579
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.260
<b>Damn it. How much more do
we need to throw in it?</b>

580
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.620
<b>Who told you to put
the coal in the steam engine?</b>

581
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.920
<b>Keep quiet Old man. 
Its not like I am doing this for myself.</b>

582
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.470
<b>Well if you are not , you better be
careful with the amount of coal you put it.</b>

583
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.030
<b>I know!</b>

584
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.100
<b>Where is Anaguma?</b>

585
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.120
<b>Anaguma?</b>

586
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:33.530
<b>My Little Assistant.</b>

587
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.970
<b>Ah yes, come to think of it , 
He went on board on one of the pirate ship.</b>

588
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.280
<b>What?!</b>

589
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.610
<b>I don't see any ship around.</b>

590
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.300
<b>I think every ship follow its route.</b>

591
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.240
<b>So anybody wanna eat?</b>

592
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.230
<b>Good idea!</b>

593
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.460
<b>Zoro , Can you check
the ship for any damage?</b>

594
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.140
<b>Don't push it on me!</b>

595
00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.360
<b>Man , she really has her way
to make us of people around her.</b>

596
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.140
<b>Anyway , Let's check
the ship for any holes…</b>

597
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.640
<b>Well it looks fine.</b>

598
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.540
<b>You chose a really bad ship to hide.
It's a pirate ship.</b>


599
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.630
<b>A kid?</b>

600
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.820
<b>How cruel of you , don't
you have sympathy even for a kid?</b>

601
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.030
<b>I didn't have a choice
, he had a gun.</b>

602
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.880
<b>Cruel! .. Cruel!</b>

603
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.360
<b>You guys…</b>

604
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.690
<b>The Supper is ready .
 Come at the table.</b>


605
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.630
<b>Are you awake now?</b>

606
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.050
<b>The racoon dog can talk!</b>

607
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.460
<b>I am not a racoon dog! 
I am a Reindeer!!</b>

608
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.390
<b>You're weird!</b>

609
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.970
<b>Shut up! , you bastard!</b>

610
00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.590
<b>No , don't say that , 
He's not a monster , he's our expert doctor.</b>

611
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.570
<b>Even if he looks a little weird.</b>

612
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.800
<b>Idiot, You're praise doesn't make me happy.</b>

613
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.820
<b>Idiot… You Stupid!</b>

614
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.140
<b>Is this what you're looking for?</b>

615
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.220
<b>You took this on a pirate ship?</b>

616
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.680
<b>Don't you know if they pirates saw
you with this , you'll be killed?</b>

617
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.690
<b>What is your goal?
Why are you here?</b>


618
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.820
<b>Well this kid hasn't recovered fully
yet , we shouldn't be hard...</b>

619
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:34.300
<b>I came here to kill
you and claim your bounties!!</b>

620
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.710
<b>You're after money? 
You are really honest though.</b>

621
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.640
<b>But there were many pirates on that
port , why did you chose us?</b>

622
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:47.010
<b>Well its certain of course. 
He must have been attracted by our Strawhat Beautiful Ship!</b>

623
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.430
<b>I don't care about it. 
This Ship is the worst of all the ships I have seen!</b>

624
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.980
<b>wow, what a joke.</b>

625
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.190
<b>You.. , I am serious.</b>

626
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.850
<b>Stop it now. 
Your body haven't…</b>

627
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.270
<b>Don't touch me!</b>

628
00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.830
<b>The pirates are being
targeted by assassins now eh...</b>

629
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.320
<b>If you aren't prepared for it
, most likely you'll be assassinated.</b>

630
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.200
<b>Show me your determination, unless
you are a small cute kid.</b>

631
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.130
<b>Don't make fun of me..!</b>

632
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.030
<b>Bastard!!</b>

633
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.360
<b>What the hell is with that?!!?!</b>

634
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.480
<b>Dev... A Devil Fruit..?</b>

635
00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.190
<b>Exactly, Didn't you saw him earlier?</b>

636
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.970
<b>I never left my hiding place.</b>

637
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.950
<b>His body has changed.</b>

638
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.100
<b>Though the price for these gifts is that once
a human eats it , he cannot swim anymore.</b>

639
00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:48.060
<b>And there are others we have , 
Robin and Chopper , with devil fruit abilities...</b>

640
00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:49.070
<b>This racoon dog?</b>

641
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.850
<b>I am a reindeer!</b>

642
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.980
<b>Kill me , kill me already!</b>

643
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.920
<b>Damn it, Just do it already!</b>

644
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.900
<b>You are very determined .
But do you happen to know the importance..</b>


645
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.820
<b>You cherish you life,  right?</b>

646
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.660
<b>Its better than to
listening to you're pirate morals!</b>

647
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.880
<b>I don't care about you , you people roaming
around the sea without any goals wasting your lives.</b>

648
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.820
<b>Zoro, give me your katana.</b>

649
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.390
<b>Don't hurt someone...</b>

650
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.140
<b>You worst of all talking like this ,</b>

651
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.790
<b>If you really want it ,  
I'll fulfill your wish!</b>

652
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.820
<b>Nami, Stop it!</b>

653
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:26.900
<b>Don't stop me!</b>

654
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.570
<b>I hate these kids ,</b>

655
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.500
<b>You say you're life
doesn't have goals , hein?</b>

656
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.530
<b>If the life doesn't have any
goals , you have to make one!!!</b>

657
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.900
<b>Stop it! , its too much.</b>

658
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.570
<b>You Guys! Stop That!</b>

659
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.840
<b>The meal is prepared.</b>

660
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.080
<b>Sanji!!</b>

661
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.040
<b>Just stay as desperate as you are! 
 Thank you for the food!!</b>


662
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:52.140
<b>I want to teach this kid a lesson
who doesn't know the importance of words like gratitude!!!</b>

663
00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.400
<b>I can't help my grandfather anymore. 
Death is my only choice.</b>

664
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:05.220
<b>Don't say things like that .
Good things will arrive soon.</b>


665
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.560
<b>Really?</b>

666
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.300
<b>If you don't want
to die, then keep struggling.</b>

667
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.820
<b>You seemed down a bit , 
Are you ill?</b>

668
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.770
<b>Grand Line don't have much islands or lands.</b>

669
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.590
<b>If you get sick, they will be worried for you.
 Let me tell you something...</b>


670
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.090
<b>When Nami-san was young,
 Her family was killed by pirates.</b>


671
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.000
<b>She live 7 years of a life with those
pirates which no one else would've wanted to live.</b>

672
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.860
<b>That reindeer also has a tragic past.</b>

673
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:42.840
<b>Nobody here has a good past.</b>

674
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.480
<b>Hey, Don't be sad.</b>

675
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.460
<b>The life is like that , it can't
be complete if there isn't anything to mourn.</b>

676
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.540
<b>Despite that if you try,
then the future can become better.</b>

677
00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.470
<b>Are you listening..?</b>

678
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.840
<b>Whats this ?
 You are actually nicer than I thought.</b>


679
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.260
<b>Oh yeah come to think of it , 
Are we lost.?</b>

680
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.110
<b>Is it okay? 
It's the list of the participants.</b>

681
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:25.730
<b>Well things like that doesn't matter… I
doubt anyone who can survive the race.</b>

682
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.680
<b>You changed our course, why?</b>

683
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.320
<b>Its fine, we should play a bit.</b>

684
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.750
<b>It will be interesting.</b>

685
00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.090
<b>Gasparde
-Sama! A ship is approaching!</b>

686
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.720
<b>Who?</b>

687
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.240
<b>Weilis, it is Hiela the Fish-man.</b>

688
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.200
<b>Its just the beginning and some of
them are so eager to die already?</b>

689
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.140
<b>Gasparde, why did you chose this course?</b>

690
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.020
<b>It was a bad choice to turn in our way. 
I'll be looking forward to crush your head.</b>

691
00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.080
<b>You're making a mistake ,
thinking so light of me.</b>

692
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.570
<b>Prepare for Battle!</b>

693
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.690
<b>Its been such a long
time since we had some fun.</b>

694
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:16.930
<b>Yes!</b>

695
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.430
<b>It's a pity that
you have to die here.</b>

696
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:28.520
<b>Your opponents are very strong...</b>

697
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.360
<b>What's he saying?</b>

698
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:31.720
<b>Nothing at all.</b>

699
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.280
<b>This ship, it's the one which
we saw before the race started.</b>

700
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.320
<b>It's Bigaro.</b>

701
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.400
<b>eh? I believed that this
one was the last ship.</b>

702
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.110
<b>oh they were at last.</b>

703
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.280
<b>Don't make fun of us!!</b>

704
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:44.770
<b>I will kill all of you...</b>

705
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.170
<b>I… I hit him?</b>

706
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.560
<b>Nice, Ussop!</b>

707
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.070
<b>It was just a piece of cake.</b>

708
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.710
<b>What did you say?</b>

709
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.520
<b>Your Turn..</b>

710
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.760
<b>Very well, then…</b>

711
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.120
<b>Wait here , 
We'll take care of them.</b>

712
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.560
<b>Allright.</b>

713
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.620
<b>I hold nothing against you so
don't mind me when I cut you.</b>

714
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.790
<b>After this, 
I will prepare the dinner.</b>

715
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.320
<b>One minute is enough to beat you all.</b>

716
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.180
<b>They are very strong.</b>

717
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.000
<b>What's that noise?</b>

718
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.840
<b>It's a nest of SeaKings!</b>

719
00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.800
<b>They are Enormous!</b>

720
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.290
<b>Idiot, Don't speak so loud!</b>

721
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.470
<b>Hey Sanji! , 
Hold a bit!</b>

722
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.780
<b>Don't you consider before where you hit?</b>

723
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.280
<b>Oi Zoro and Sanji hasn't return yet…</b>

724
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.400
<b>oh right, its true. 
Ahhoyyy…!</b>

725
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:14.830
<b>That was great , Zoro.</b>

726
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.310
<b>Why didn't you come earlier to save us?</b>

727
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.840
<b>I was great , right??</b>

728
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.620
<b>This is really delicious.</b>

729
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.120
<b>Oi, you want to eat?</b>

730
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.080
<b>The Food is on the table.</b>

731
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.650
<b>Are you all reckless
all the times like that?</b>

732
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.590
<b>You already know that you're taking very
dangerous risk which may take your life.</b>

733
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.820
<b>but still you don't stop taking risks.</b>

734
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.430
<b>Dying or Losing Life isn't funny you know!</b>

735
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.500
<b>But that wasn't dangerous.</b>

736
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.010
<b>This is not a joke!</b>

737
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.460
<b>You are not afraid of death?</b>

738
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.250
<b>Of course I am.</b>

739
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.560
<b>Then why?</b>

740
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.580
<b>I was saved by pirates
when I was very young,</b>

741
00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.700
<b>and one of them lost
an arm while saving me…</b>

742
00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.160
<b>Don't be afraid now.</b>

743
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.920
<b>You're not hurt. 
You're allright now, 
I am glad.</b>

744
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:07.490
<b>If its for him , 
I can even die.</b>

745
00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.120
<b>He taught me lot of things. So</b>

746
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.020
<b>I know my ambitions are big , but
if I try my best in my life...</b>

747
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.710
<b>chasing those ambitions or goals might become a reality. 
It doesn't matter if I get hit or</b>

748
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:21.590
<b>die while chasing , 
I'll happily accept if that is as far as I can go.</b>

749
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.000
<b>Why these flowers?</b>

750
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:27.690
<b>Those are flowers?</b>

751
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.520
<b>Why they look so dull?</b>

752
00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.440
<b>Oy Sanji. They are very small.</b>

753
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:32.900
<b>It doesn't matter!</b>

754
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.630
<b>Boss! the ship can't go further.</b>

755
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.710
<b>Let's run away!</b>

756
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.050
<b>Why is this happening...</b>

757
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.520
<b>Isn't it... Partia? 
Whats happening here?!</b>

758
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.910
<b>What happened here...?</b>

759
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.670
<b>The Navy did this...?!</b>

760
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.110
<b>Is it sinked?</b>

761
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.260
<b>Affirmative.</b>

762
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.050
<b>There is another ship approaching!</b>

763
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.250
<b>Another one? 
What's happening today?!</b>

764
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:19.720
<b>Nami-san , what's wrong?</b>

765
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.150
<b>It's not the wrong path... 
The Log Pose is still directing us towards this way...</b>

766
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.860
<b>Ne , Are you sure
this log pose is for Partia?</b>

767
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.640
<b>Damn it, I knew it
we couldn't trust that Enlister!</b>

768
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.920
<b>Its a Plan of Gasparde for sure..</b>

769
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.430
<b>Luffy…</b>

770
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.380
<b>He's the only one who
can do something like this..</b>

771
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.740
<b>There must be something we could do still..</b>

772
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:47.550
<b>It's true. I can't be wrong.</b>

773
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.080
<b>Wait, I believe that I've seen
the log pose for Partia before...</b>

774
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:57.400
<b>Not long ago I saw a Eternal Pose
on his ship. that was probably the correct one.</b>

775
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.990
<b>Oh so you were on another pirate ship?</b>

776
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.530
<b>You are fine young Strategist.</b>

777
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.020
<b>And a fine dumb brat.</b>

778
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.840
<b>What should we do? 
Continue our Journey?</b>

779
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.340
<b>No we can't , without the
right Eternal Pose, it's completely useless.</b>

780
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.530
<b>It's true , nothing can be
done now , its already too late!</b>

781
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.570
<b>For my grandfather also…</b>

782
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.570
<b>Your grandfather?</b>

783
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:20.860
<b>He's not my real grandfather, he's just
an old man who saved my life.</b>

784
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:25.010
<b>But now he's very sick… and
other people doesn't care about him..</b>

785
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.610
<b>It is for him that I...</b>

786
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.060
<b>So thats why you came on
our ship to get the bounty?</b>

787
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.060
<b>Yes..</b>

788
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.380
<b>Are you Stupid?</b>

789
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.200
<b>To come here instead
of looking after you're grandfather..</b>

790
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.630
<b>But…</b>

791
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:46.640
<b>If you really wanted him
to live , then fight!</b>

792
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.300
<b>If you want help , Ask us!</b>

793
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.000
<b>But don't ever Lose Hope!</b>

794
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.110
<b>Luffy…</b>

795
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.500
<b>And what do you hope to do?</b>

796
00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:05.670
<b>Well you came on the right time. 
I  was just thinking of beating his ass. 
You wanna come?</b>

797
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.270
<b>I do, take me along!!!</b>

798
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.520
<b>Very well.</b>

799
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.940
<b>Guess I dont have a choice.
I must give up the reward of 3 million berry.</b>

800
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.930
<b>Well then we should go
and recover Eternal Pose from him.</b>

801
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:23.080
<b>Excuse me? you mean to fight against Gasparde?</b>

802
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.810
<b>woah Enemy!</b>

803
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:26.810
<b>Gomu Gomu No..... Baloon!</b>

804
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.030
<b>Yosh! Let's Go!</b>

805
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.600
<b>Wait a bit , 
How will we find that guy?</b>

806
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:37.600
<b>Chopper's Nose..</b>

807
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:38.150
<b>Oh.. i see</b>

808
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.380
<b>Allright.</b>

809
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.350
<b>That's ridiculous.</b>

810
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.730
<b>They are strong! dangerous!. 
Dont Worry We'll handle them all.</b>

811
00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.020
<b>You are Really Gonna go there?</b>

812
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.250
<b>Exactly.</b>

813
00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.440
<b>What are you doing?</b>

814
00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:12.060
<b>I will not let you
go up with that intent.</b>

815
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:15.760
<b>What do you hope to
do in your current state?</b>

816
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:19.700
<b>Don't make me laugh. 
I wouldn't be worried about that!</b>

817
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.900
<b>I am one of the
last people in this apartment.</b>

818
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:25.570
<b>You'll be killed someday
if you don't stop interfering.</b>

819
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:29.270
<b>Atleast i will be of some
good use , unlike those Pirates!</b>

820
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.640
<b>You sure speak ahead of you Old Man.</b>

821
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:33.060
<b>Stop your rubbish!</b>

822
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:36.550
<b>Go and Do some Decent
work so you can eat Decently!</b>

823
00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.060
<b>There's isn't much fuel left.</b>

824
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.310
<b>I have to do my job.</b>

825
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.840
<b>What are you doing down here
, you have nothing to do here..</b>

826
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.240
<b>I know..</b>

827
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:58.650
<b>I Don't want to destroy this ship, 
I have too many memories of here.</b>

828
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.640
<b>I just want to cause a big ruckus.</b>

829
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.470
<b>So that I may find
a Chance to Kill him.</b>

830
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.310
<b>It's nonsense. 
This method will not work.</b>

831
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.130
<b>Is it true? you
are here to Kill Gaspard?</b>

832
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.770
<b>If my body would let me , 
I would've helped you.</b>

833
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:24.110
<b>Are you okay Old man?</b>

834
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:28.810
<b>I'm just sick but i wont
die until i see Anaguma for myself.</b>

835
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.810
<b>Anaguma?</b>

836
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.130
<b>My assistant.</b>

837
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:34.810
<b>He's currently working for pirates
in order to help me.</b>

838
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:41.570
<b>This bastard Gaspard. 
He filled Anaguma's head with his rubbish..</b>

839
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.000
<b>That Kid?</b>

840
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.820
<b>You saw him?</b>

841
00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:52.020
<b>I crossed him while leaving for
race, he had some odd aura.</b>

842
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:55.050
<b>Did you talk to him? 
Did he say something?!</b>

843
00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.450
<b>I know there are good pirates unlike Gaspard...</b>

844
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.800
<b>Pirates Like Gaspard can
strongly effect kid's mind badly!</b>

845
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:06.710
<b>That kid.. I wish he's still alive..</b>

846
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.970
<b>Well uptil now, all the pirates
whom I met were all very similar.</b>

847
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:15.080
<b>A cheap bunch of
good-for-nothings who belittle others completely.</b>

848
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.920
<b>It's strange , 
I think I have seen you somewhere before.</b>

849
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:21.860
<b>Me?</b>

850
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.870
<b>You said a while ago that
you have some memories of this place..</b>

851
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.000
<b>What are those memories?</b>

852
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:28.320
<b>You are not only here
to kill Gaspard , right?</b>

853
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:32.520
<b>You must've something else to do , right? 
You... who are you…?</b>

854
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.210
<b>Old man you talk too much. 
It's true i m here for bounty on his head..</b>

855
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:39.680
<b>But it wont be enough, because there is a limit with all that.
Its nothing I m that interested in..</b>

856
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:44.120
<b>My father built boats. 
Basically this skill (BoatMaking) was already flourished in the city where he was born in.</b>

857
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.610
<b>One day a ship came for repairs,
but after the repairs the killed everyone..</b>

858
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:54.080
<b>That man was Gaspard. 
It was around 8 years ago.</b>

859
00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:02.090
<b>There were only handful survivors… I strived there and come to
think of it now I don't want to live there anymore!</b>

860
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:07.230
<b>I understand So it is revenge you're after?</b>

861
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.980
<b>What do you understand?!</b>

862
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.350
<b>Well its funny considering how we've just met...</b>

863
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.580
<b>But its already too late. 
Blood has already been spilled..</b>

864
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.200
<b>I have involved myself in something very dangerous..
and some people have to lost their lives...</b>

865
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:28.520
<b>But now I'll do this alone.. . 
All by myself..</b>

866
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:31.840
<b>Idiot, you mustn't lose hope!. 
As long as you can live you can...</b>

867
00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:34.930
<b>Old man its already too late...</b>

868
00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.940
<b>Well I'm going now.. 
Im sure that kid Anaguma is still alive somewhere..</b>

869
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.320
<b>Wait! Tell me your name!</b>

870
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:47.240
<b>Shuraya! Shuraya Baskedo.</b>

871
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:04.430
<b>Big-brother!</b>

872
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.370
<b>Andelu!</b>

873
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:18.190
<b>Hurry, Bounty Hunter..</b>

874
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.860
<b>I'm getting impatient here..</b>

875
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.720
<b>I would be honored to have a fight with you ,
any time, which is growing inside you that you may burst anytime..</b>

876
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:46.200
<b>I already listened to your conversation.
I know that you are not here for gold or money.</b>

877
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.940
<b>You worked this much during those 8 years?</b>

878
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:52.730
<b>And yet you seem
so impatient and inexperienced now.</b>

879
00:59:54.750 --> 01:00:00.950
<b>I am also eager fight against you, but
he would like to fight against you first.</b>

880
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.130
<b>I will be here as spectator.</b>

881
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:06.770
<b>Let's see who dies First!</b>

882
01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.930
<b>You are also one of my target!</b>

883
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.120
<b>Hey, Don't damage the ship..</b>

884
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.970
<b>Hehe, it's broken.</b>

885
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.600
<b>I told you to
not to damage the boat!</b>

886
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.720
<b>Get a hold of yourself! Hey!! Wake up!</b>

887
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.480
<b>How are you now? 
You dont have anything left do you?</b>

888
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:41.140
<b>These are the orders of Gaspard. 
Burn Everything to Ashes!</b>

889
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.070
<b>And don't leave any survivor!!</b>

890
01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.450
<b>Big
-Brother!!</b>

891
01:01:56.310 --> 01:02:01.130
<b>Marvellous, 
It's a very rare boat which we have here..</b>

892
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.670
<b>I think we should take it!</b>

893
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:07.310
<b>And moreover, there is an old
man which can make engine work.</b>

894
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.910
<b>Now its your turn…</b>

895
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.560
<b>I will kill this man, 
I will not let him live anymore..</b>

896
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:27.360
<b>heh , Be careful with those claws..</b>

897
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.520
<b>Die!</b>

898
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.480
<b>The final blow.</b>

899
01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.960
<b>Goodbye…</b>

900
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.380
<b>What happened here?</b>

901
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.030
<b>Hey, look over there!</b>

902
01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:49.020
<b>Shit, the engine stopped all of
a sudden , is it gonna explode?</b>

<b>You are quite persistent!</b>

1055
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.260
<b>You forgot something of importance here.</b>

1056
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.270
<b>It is a very precious hat I believe,</b>

1057

<b>a treasure that Shanks the Red
-Hair gave you!</b>

<b>It's not mine!

<b>I wont touch it

<b>Stop, If you don't I'll never forgive you!</b>

1061

<b>You Little insect! , 
Do you believe you can threaten me?</b>

1062

<b>Very well… I'll return it to you.</b>

1070

<b>Eh well… that really doesn't resemble a battle.</b>

1071
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:29.320
<b>Wind has changed, 
I can feel a great storm heading for us..</b>

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.600
<b>But what it could be..</b>

<b>Luffy, Hurry and Finish him off already!</b>

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.930
<b>You are still here!?</b>

<b>Of course. What are
you saying there all alone?</b>

1083
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.680
<b>Straw hat is fighting against Gaspard.</b>

<b>All the others were beaten.
The only ones left are you.</b>

<b>This boat is about to explode.</b>

1086

<b>You should leave this ship
as soon as you can.</b>

1087
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:44.130
<b>What?</b>

1088
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.980
<b>Grandfather.</b>

1089
01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.220
<b>Who is there?</b>

1090
01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.980
<b>It's me. Strawhat crewmate.</b>

<b>What do you want?

<b>Don't you wanna come?
This child is waiting for you!</b>


1093

<b>I know , this child
is very precious to me.</b>

1094
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.900
<b>But at the end ,
I still want to remain with this ship.</b>


1095
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.660
<b>Quickly! Escape!!</b>

1096

<b>This ship will soon explode!</b>

1097
01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.580
<b>Luffy…</b>

1098
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:21.200
<b>Is he okay?</b>

1099
01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.130
<b>yes there's no mistake.

<b>This guy…</b>

1101
01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:31.750
<b>You're stupid , still fighting

1102
01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:36.350
<b>yet making so much effort..</b>

1103
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.880
<b>I already told you I won't forgive you!!!</b>

1104
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.270
<b>Stop it, your attacks are useless.</b>

1105
01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.240
<b>You didn't even aim at me.</b>

1106
01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:52.220
<b>Is this all a man
worth 30 million bounty can do?</b>

1107
01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.280
<b>I will kill you , quickly without pain.</b>

1108
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.400
<b>I will kill you with kindness.</b>

1109
01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.840
<b>Gomu Gomu No....

<b>We must hurry the ship is gonna explode, 
Let's Escape!</b>

1113

<b>The Battle isn't finished yet.</b>

1114
01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:34.760
<b>I'm impressed..</b>

1115
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:42.040
<b>It's been such a long time
since i've had this much fun</b>

1116
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.570
<b>This guy.. he sure is something else..</b>

1117
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.020
<b>I get it. I'll go first.</b>

1118
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.690
<b>Can I go?</b>

1119
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.420
<b>Ofcourse!</b>

1120
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:51.420
<b>Here take this.</b>

1121
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:52.470
<b>What's this?</b>

1122
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.950
<b>Use it carefully, Okay..</b>

1123
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.600
<b>Sanji, you are late.</b>

1124
01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:02.810
<b>Let's leave quickly ,
this place is getting dangerous!</b>

1125
01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.210
<b>It's really dangerous , the storm is going berserk, 
Where is Luffy?</b>

1126
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:09.100
<b>Wait.. Didn't you go to get the oldman?</b>

1127
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.380
<b>He decided to remain with the ship.
The ship is gonna explode any minute now!</b>


1128
01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.300
<b>Is this a joke?
Quickly, turn back!!</b>


1129
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:28.050
<b>Why did you left him on the ship?!</b>

1130
01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.500
<b>You said you'll help me , then why?!</b>

1131
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:32.170
<b>Luffy?</b>

1132
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.030
<b>He's still fighting on the ship..</b>

1133
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.010
<b>Zoro?</b>

1134
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.230
<b>It is better like that.</b>

1135
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.180
<b>You mean to strike a girl on head?!</b>

1136
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.330
<b>You had not guessed?</b>

1137
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:46.690
<b>This child… is a girl!</b>

1138
01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.740
<b>Is Luffy Allright?</b>

1139
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:28.750
<b>I don't know.</b>

1140
01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.000
<b>Why you don't know?</b>

1141
01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:34.910
<b>Well with a explosion like that..</b>

1142
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.780
<b>And the grandfather… ?</b>

1143
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.050
<b>Everything is…</b>

1144
01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:41.170
<b>Everything what? 
I don't understand..</b>

1145
01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.900
<b>Anyway quickly, we must save Luffy!</b>

1146
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:46.070
<b>Wait. He's alive.</b>

1147
01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:49.270
<b>And Gaspard too.</b>

1148
01:20:56.710 --> 01:21:00.540
<b>What? What Happened?</b>

1149
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:05.410
<b>Where's he? 
Did he ran away?</b>

1150
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.450
<b>I am here!
There you are! Bastard!</b>


1151
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.310
<b>You did not escape yet?</b>

1152
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.230
<b>Your crew already left though.</b>

1153
01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.300
<b>Could it be that they abandoned you?</b>

1154
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:26.460
<b>They didn't leave. 
They are my friends!</b>

1155
01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.630
<b>I don't have a crew on my ship!</b>

1156
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:34.180
<b>Why these Friends? 
Why not your underlings?</b>

1157
01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:37.640
<b>You are a pirate and you believe in the friendship?
Don't make me laugh!</b>


1158
01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:41.880
<b>In the middle of this ocean, it just “eat or be eaten”, 
There are no other rules!</b>

1159
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.810
<b>Only the Strength counts.</b>

1160
01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:49.220
<b>Although I hate this sea,yet for more
power I left the Navy to become pirate.</b>

1161
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:51.160
<b>Because I was born for power!</b>

1162
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.990
<b>Thats why you're just a stupid bastard.</b>

1163
01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:01.220
<b>You don't understand a thing.
 Thats why you utter such nonsense.</b>


1164
01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:07.440
<b>Being a pirate is about having reliable companions ,
 If you don't have then you don't qualify for being a pirate!</b>


1165
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.570
<b>That's what I wanted to say , 
So now i'll kick your ass.</b>

1166
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.680
<b>Right now!</b>

1167
01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:16.150
<b>Very interesting.</b>

1168
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.880
<b>You are the first to have battle
with me for such a long time</b>

1169
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:24.060
<b>To show you my respect, 
I will you with something special!</b>

1170
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:28.420
<b>There is a safeboat behind me.</b>

1171
01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:30.470
<b>And look behind you…</b>

1172
01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.560
<b>Ah!!! What the hell is that?!</b>

1173
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.610
<b>You are surprised?
This storm is very dangerous.</b>


1174
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:43.390
<b>Its really bad , infact its one
of the worst thing you face on sea.</b>

1175
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:47.960
<b>Now let's see who Lives and who Dies..</b>

1176
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.840
<b>Let's go...</b>

1177
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:59.690
<b>Its useless , your fists don't hurt me.</b>

1178
01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:06.970
<b>It hurts!</b>

1179
01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:10.260
<b>Why?
How did you touch me?</b>


1180
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:12.310
<b>It's…</b>

1181
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:18.430
<b>Flour…?</b>

1182
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.350
<b>I cannot lose now anymore!</b>

1183
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:26.580
<b>Let's Continue!</b>

1184
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.420
<b>Gomu Gomu no.......... Gatling!!</b>

1185
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.060
<b>You have no right to be a pirate! ,

1186
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:49.030
<b>It's the end for you!!</b>

1187
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:51.030
<b>Gomu Gomu no.................
Spinning Axe!</b>

1188
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.190
<b>Idiot, That didn't work on me..</b>

1189
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:08.010
<b>It's my turn, Take this! Shredder!</b>

1190
01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.030
<b>You idiot… you believe you can touch
me while i have spikes on my body?</b>

1191
01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.460
<b>Gomu Gomu No.........</b>

1192
01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:20.530
<b>Then die trying!</b>

1193
01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.020
<b><b>BAZOOKA!</b></b>

<b>Atlast its finished...</b>

1195
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:46.990
<b>I won..</b>

1196
01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.760
<b>You saw that?</b>

1197
01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.190
<b>It Getting Dangerous!</b>

1198
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.050
<b>Luffy don't have anymore power left within him?</b>

1199
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:03.230
<b>If he dont get out of
there this could get very bad!</b>

1200
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:05.070

<b>I don't have any more reason to live..</b>

1213

<b>Excuse me, but can you adopt this girl?</b>

1229

<b>I am too young to be a mother.</b>

1230
