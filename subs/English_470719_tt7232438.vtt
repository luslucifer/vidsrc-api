Movie released on www.YTS.ME

3
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.913
"Corpse"

00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:32.044
"1997"

5
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.880
Come, do it now

6
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.340
doing what?

7
00:02:36.674 --> 00:02:38.842
Put your hand next to me

8
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.902
Don't move, otherwise it will draw crooked off

9
00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:07.246
Reserved

10
00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.998
My dad has talked to your dad

11
00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:10.582
They will give us a unit

12
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.629
But this layer has only one unit

13
00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.471
He never said that he
could not choose the penthouse

14
00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:27.057
Ancient confusion

15
00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:28.809
But I like it

16
00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:30.686
Promise me, after completion

17
00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:31.854
We move together to live

18
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.273
it is good

19
00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:39.695
No regret

20
00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:41.447
it is good

21
00:04:41.757 --> 00:04:42.883
Wait

22
00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:45.344
Don't forget to use
the ring I gave you

23
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:47.262
So we are like Shuangmei Mark

24
00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:49.348
Don't you remember?

25
00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.683
The mall has a new sticker camera

26
00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:54.436
OK, we see the school tomorrow

27
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.773
My business is over when you do this

28
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.732
What do they say?

29
00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:00.192
Banks are going bankrupt

30
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:01.360
collapse?

31
00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:04.113
You can't do that

32
00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:08.117
All my cash and assets...

33
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.827
What happened?

34
00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:26.635
Thailand becomes Asia's economy
The dream of the fifth largest country has come to nothing


35
00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:29.263
The government announced the
Thai baht exchange rate fluctuations

36
00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.391
Leading to an unprecedented drop
in the Thai economic index

37
00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.144
Thailand is about to go bankrupt

38
00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:38.730
Due to the economic collapse,
many companies closed their businesses

39
00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:41.775
The government ordered 16
financial institutions to cease operations

40
00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:46.280
At present, the core of
Thailand's economy has ceased operation

41
00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:50.117
More than three million people are
expected to be unemployed this year

42
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.286
Numbers continue to rise

43
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.833
The company goes bankrupt, so
I have to sell something

44
00:05:58.167 --> 00:05:59.626
Thai baht devaluation

45
00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:03.255
From 25 Thai baht to 1
US dollar down to 56 Thai baht

46
00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:07.134
Debts of various industries
are high and bankrupt overnight

47
00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:09.052
We lost this battle

48
00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:10.220
"Dilapidated households rich market"

49
00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.973
Directly affected is...

50
00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:21.732
The people's life is very difficult

51
00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:22.858
Get out!

52
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.944
Without income, the public can
only live and work hard

53
00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:30.157
The real estate market has
frozen nearly 200 billion baht

54
00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:33.869
Overhead demand for residential buildings and skyscrapers

55
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:35.871
Nobody wants to buy now

56
00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:50.427
"No entry"

57
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.001
My dad is a bad guy

58
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.797
How can he do this to you?

59
00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:30.319
Here's what I bought for you

60
00:08:35.073 --> 00:08:38.493
Your dad still want to commit suicide?

61
00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:42.414
He is so poor

62
00:08:42.998 --> 00:08:44.833
What to do will not be successful

63
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.835
When he wants to commit suicide

64
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.921
My mom hid the gun so
that he could not find it

65
00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:55.052
But I know where she hides

66
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.100
and so…

67
00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:05.270
Do you want to kill your dad?

68
00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:09.775
No, I can't give up

69
00:09:11.777 --> 00:09:13.278
I am still relatively easy to commit suicide

70
00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:18.116
Are you stupid?

71
00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:21.286
Who are you dead?

72
00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:31.963
Our family will be seized next week

73
00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:36.635
My mom may take us to somewhere else

74
00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.557
I'm afraid I can't see you again

75
00:09:45.435 --> 00:09:47.020
Don't worry too much

76
00:09:51.108 --> 00:09:53.735
Here's for you

77
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.990
This is my tuition

78
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.830
Anyway, I don't want
to read that rotten school

79
00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:10.168
Without you, am I good?

80
00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:16.258
You less exaggerated

81
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.764
What can I call at any time?

82
00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:27.394
don't Cry

83
00:10:39.823 --> 00:10:42.367
"Happy birthday to you!"

84
00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:50.083
"Now call you Miss."

85
00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:53.253
"I hope we
Can go through this difficulty together


86
00:10:55.172 --> 00:10:58.800
Thai baht currency has been fluctuating since 1996

87
00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:03.096
Stock market investors began to manipulate the market

88
00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:06.099
Spread rumors at the same time

89
00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:08.602
Said that the Thai economy is in crisis

90
00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:10.645
Now it is a daytime shower

91
00:11:10.729 --> 00:11:12.773
As a result, stock is gradually being shorted

92
00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:15.901
Bank of Thailand's stance is firm

93
00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:20.197
Don't reduce the Thai baht, in
order to defend the Thai baht

94
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.656
Intervene...

95
00:11:28.914 --> 00:11:29.790
dad

96
00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:44.221
Why don't you talk to Daddy?
Continue to build Sathorn Building?


97
00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:45.555
do you know?

98
00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:50.268
I went back to stock
broking for a few days

99
00:11:50.852 --> 00:11:54.397
There is a big passenger to
give me money to buy stocks

100
00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:57.567
We will be rich again

101
00:11:59.444 --> 00:12:00.779
Really? Dad?

102
00:12:01.071 --> 00:12:01.822
Really

103
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.117
Not bad right?

104
00:12:35.897 --> 00:12:39.943
"I must move somewhere else."

105
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.405
"I may never see you again."

106
00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:50.287
Where did the money go?

107
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.872
What money, Mom?

108
00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.208
The school called you have not paid tuition

109
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.668
Where did the money go?

110
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.883
I have spent it

111
00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:04.968
How can you spend it?

112
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:06.344
I gave you a lot of money

113
00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:08.471
What did you bought?

114
00:13:13.018 --> 00:13:13.768
Mom!

115
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.647
Let go

116
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.489
Do you know how hard
it is to make money?

117
00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:29.200
Even used to buy this meaningless thing

118
00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.912
My daughter will not mess like this

119
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.668
Am I still your daughter?

120
00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.130
Did you think of
me when making your decision?

121
00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:44.424
Help me transfer to school casually

122
00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:46.760
Also forced me to go to
the streets to help you sell things

123
00:13:49.012 --> 00:13:51.556
I will be very shameful
when I see my friend

124
00:13:54.976 --> 00:13:56.102
If you let me choose

125
00:13:56.645 --> 00:13:58.229
I will not want to
be born as your daughter

126
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.237
Since you feel shameful

127
00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:07.489
Get out

128
00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:08.990
Just die to the edge

129
00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:25.048
"Dad hit me again"

130
00:14:25.173 --> 00:14:27.717
"I can't stand it anymore."

131
00:14:35.725 --> 00:14:36.601
Hey?

132
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.228
Ok

133
00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:39.646
Give you

134
00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:40.689
Miss

135
00:14:41.022 --> 00:14:41.815
Pay money

136
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.024
I am sorry

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.318

Wes Kraven directed

139
00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.134
You don't have to worry about it

140
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:13.013
Believe me, you will make big money

141
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.059
It's fun to talk
to people who understand things

142
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.604
Those scholars don't know what to say

143
00:15:24.149 --> 00:15:24.983
do you know?

144
00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:30.113
Waiting for the market
temperature, those scholars are unemployed

145
00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:33.116
So they want to blindly scared

146
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:37.370
But I think...

147
00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:40.206
Currently

148
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:42.167
Those moths that extinguish
the fire will die first

149
00:15:44.127 --> 00:15:45.879
That's right

150
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.133
Wen

151
00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:51.593
How did you come?

152
00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:53.386
Only you?

153
00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:55.555
Wait for me, we'll go home together

154
00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:58.141
I'll dump with guests first

155
00:15:58.558 --> 00:15:59.267
Yes

156
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.103
That oil group, as I said

157
00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:03.980
The most stable array

158
00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:07.609
In any case, the
government has to subsidize them

159
00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:11.488
That's right

160
00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.410
Right, it is time

161
00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:19.496
Trust me

162
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.831
I have inside information

181810

165
00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:36.930
It is meaningless to be alive

166
00:16:37.722 --> 00:16:38.807
I am going to
the building waiting for you

167
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.393
I remember with that velvet bag

168
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:24.352
Are you afraid?

169
00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:37.615
Don't be afraid

170
00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:41.786
If you continue to live,
how much will be hurt?

171
00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:00.263
Don't let me die alone

172
00:18:08.563 --> 00:18:09.814
promise me

173
00:18:23.244 --> 00:18:24.204
happy Birthday

174
00:19:20.802 --> 00:19:27.016
Don't want to see anything,
don't want to see the sky

175
00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:32.313
My eyes want to rest forever

176
00:19:41.072 --> 00:19:43.866
Other important news

177
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.329
Investigate the project of "Man
Yi Hao Life" apartment building

178
00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:50.707
"2017"

179
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.668
It has been found that the blueprints
have not been constructed according to the design

180
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:57.630
Officials have revoked construction licenses

181
00:19:57.714 --> 00:20:01.301
The following is the chief
executive of the contractor development company

182
00:20:01.384 --> 00:20:04.053
Interview with Parivian Ryan Vichaya

183
00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:07.140
This is the responsibility of the contractor

184
00:20:07.348 --> 00:20:09.726
We are about to
file a complaint against them

185
00:20:10.018 --> 00:20:13.187
If you continue to develop
the plan, will be informed

186
00:20:13.563 --> 00:20:17.358
"Monday"

187
00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:24.657
Miss Pa, the car arrived

188
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:26.784
Belle and the manager are
waiting for you in the car

189
00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:28.619
OK, I'll go right away

190
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:37.837
Sathorn Building Construction Project

191
00:20:41.257 --> 00:20:44.177
Fortunately, you continue to build this building

192
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.138
Otherwise, our company will be declared bankrupt

193
00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:49.390
don't worry

194
00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:53.561
I have also experienced that kind of thing

195
00:20:54.437 --> 00:20:56.272
I know how terrible it feels

196
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.026
I will not repeat history

197
00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:03.446
Mani project is a pity

198
00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:05.615
We have invested a lot of money

199
00:21:05.823 --> 00:21:07.658
Did not expect that kind of thing happen

200
00:22:19.522 --> 00:22:22.400
The structure is 100% safe

201
00:22:22.984 --> 00:22:26.571
The structure of the building
was completed before the shutdown

202
00:22:31.159 --> 00:22:32.118
I am sorry

203
00:22:33.494 --> 00:22:35.371
what's up?

204
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:42.044
You can see the
building is still very attractive

205
00:22:43.754 --> 00:22:46.215
Has been idle for 20 years

206
00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:49.552
Because the other half
belongs to my dad's partner

207
00:22:50.094 --> 00:22:54.348
It's hard to find land
right in the city center

208
00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:57.935
As long as you are willing to give us a loan, 
I would like to...

209
00:22:57.977 --> 00:23:01.772
Miss Pau, Man Arnold
loan you have not paid

210
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.609
We are going to file
a bankruptcy application for you

211
00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:08.070
How could you approve another loan to you?

212
00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:12.492
Even if you confiscate all
of our assets for resale

213
00:23:13.201 --> 00:23:14.494
Not enough full loan

214
00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:17.330
And you have to sell it all

215
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:22.251
But if you give me
a loan to build this building

216
00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:24.587
We will have enough money

217
00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:27.340
Manui and Sathorn are paid
two pen counts to the bank

218
00:23:27.423 --> 00:23:29.842
This is good for you and me, right?

219
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.514
I will give you a week

220
00:23:34.597 --> 00:23:36.974
You clarify with your partner

221
00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:40.353
We have to make sure that the
project will be carried out as scheduled

222
00:23:40.603 --> 00:23:43.689
Otherwise, I must file
a bankruptcy application for you

223
00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:47.527
Absolutely no problem

224
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.506
Hey

225
00:26:56.924 --> 00:26:58.259
I just stroll

226
00:26:58.843 --> 00:27:00.136
I'll drop right away

227
00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:01.637
OK, Mom

228
00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:05.182
"happy Birthday"

229
00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:16.253
Why did you bring it back?

230
00:28:16.837 --> 00:28:18.214
Dirty and old

231
00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:21.175
I have never seen a real pager

232
00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:22.760
Only seen online

233
00:28:22.843 --> 00:28:24.762
You know old stuff

234
00:28:25.554 --> 00:28:26.472
Open to it!

235
00:28:26.555 --> 00:28:27.598
Scared to death 咩

236
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:28.973
Can also be used

237
00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:30.434
Do you have a message? tell me

238
00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:31.060
Yes!

239
00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:33.145
Rose is red

240
00:28:33.354 --> 00:28:35.397
Violet is blue

241
00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:37.817
please tell me…

242
00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:40.318
Point solution I will hang you?

243
00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:42.612
Very old fashioned

244
00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:44.073
and also…

245
00:28:44.615 --> 00:28:47.076
1,2,3, shark live

246
00:28:47.201 --> 00:28:49.370
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

247
00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:51.997
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

248
00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:55.292
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

249
00:28:57.628 --> 00:29:00.923
Writing is good, but using
the map is much simpler

250
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:01.966
Right

251
00:29:02.299 --> 00:29:05.886
In those days they wanted
to say such things to strangers

252
00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:07.555
Will not be awkward?

253
00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:13.936
what happened?

254
00:29:16.772 --> 00:29:19.775
Don't want to see anything,
don't want to see the sky

255
00:29:20.818 --> 00:29:23.487
My eyes want to rest forever

256
00:29:25.072 --> 00:29:28.075
Hide in the shadow of the moon

257
00:29:29.285 --> 00:29:31.537
Just want to dream, no longer awake

258
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.500
I feel really sad

259
00:29:38.711 --> 00:29:39.879
As if heard

260
00:29:39.962 --> 00:29:42.590
Should be the lyrics come

261
00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:44.508
wait for me

262
00:29:47.511 --> 00:29:48.220
found it

263
00:29:48.888 --> 00:29:50.139
Passed to you

264
00:29:53.434 --> 00:29:54.393
This is the link

265
00:29:54.435 --> 00:29:55.227
it is good

266
00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:05.070
Don't want to see anything,
don't want to see the sky

267
00:30:05.195 --> 00:30:10.242
My eyes want to rest forever

268
00:30:14.496 --> 00:30:15.247
Peach

269
00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:17.666
Last message

270
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.461
It is meaningless to be alive

271
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:22.171
I am going to
the building waiting for you

272
00:30:23.422 --> 00:30:25.716
I remember with that velvet bag

273
00:30:32.973 --> 00:30:35.184
Do you think the same as I thought?

274
00:30:45.235 --> 00:30:47.321
It may be nothing

275
00:30:47.613 --> 00:30:49.865
Maybe just a joke

276
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:51.200
Oh shit!

277
00:30:54.036 --> 00:30:55.329
Scared you!

278
00:30:56.413 --> 00:30:57.830
Are you scared? I am sorry

279
00:30:57.831 --> 00:30:59.666
Don't open this joke

280
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:01.835
Tin back to you

281
00:31:02.002 --> 00:31:03.003
Okay

282
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.452
Is it you, Belle?

283
00:33:31.318 --> 00:33:32.444
Belle?

284
00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:29.084
You want to point?

285
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:31.962
I have the alarm

286
00:34:57.446 --> 00:34:58.155
Belle

287
00:34:58.614 --> 00:34:59.531
Someone broke in

288
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:00.991
Call the police

289
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.159
Faster!

290
00:35:06.747 --> 00:35:08.040
How many people live here?

291
00:35:08.582 --> 00:35:09.374
Two

292
00:35:11.877 --> 00:35:13.629
My husband passed away long ago

293
00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:20.427
We did not find anyone searching everywhere

294
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:22.638
I went to see the fire escape

295
00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:24.806
Wait for me here

296
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:26.433
Okay, police officer

297
00:35:34.358 --> 00:35:35.734
What are you looking for?

298
00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:37.069
My cell phone

299
00:35:37.152 --> 00:35:38.445
It must be in the room

300
00:35:38.654 --> 00:35:39.780
I'll look for it

301
00:35:39.947 --> 00:35:41.031
Wait for me to get it

302
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:05.764
Sorry, my wife

303
00:36:06.265 --> 00:36:07.182
what's up?

304
00:36:07.307 --> 00:36:10.435
How long was the handprint on the wall?

305
00:36:37.671 --> 00:36:40.424
When the maid's gone, 
I locked the door

306
00:36:40.549 --> 00:36:42.509
No one came in again later

307
00:36:42.759 --> 00:36:43.677
Try fast turn

308
00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:51.643
What is the problem? Press play

309
00:38:10.263 --> 00:38:11.598
"Tuesday"

310
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:15.227
I thought Belle was no
longer sleepy after age five

311
00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.105
This is her first time sleepwalking again?

312
00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:18.814
Yes, doctor

313
00:38:18.939 --> 00:38:20.023
you sure?

314
00:38:20.107 --> 00:38:24.027
Sometimes the patient will sleepwalking for many years

315
00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:26.905
But don't know their sleepwalking

316
00:38:26.988 --> 00:38:28.824
Because they are sleeping alone

317
00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:33.078
Doctors…

318
00:38:33.954 --> 00:38:37.207
Why did Belle begin to draw while dreaming?

319
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:38.750
in fact…

320
00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:40.752
When the patient is sleepwalking

321
00:38:41.128 --> 00:38:42.504
No matter the way

322
00:38:42.838 --> 00:38:44.881
It is good to see or do anything

323
00:38:45.632 --> 00:38:50.262
They are all done according to subconscious instructions

324
00:39:04.568 --> 00:39:07.112
For example, her current symptoms

325
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.324
Is caused by the imbalance of neurotransmitters

326
00:39:11.992 --> 00:39:13.285
Does she need to be hospitalized again?

327
00:39:13.452 --> 00:39:14.286
Not necessary

328
00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:16.705
I will prescribe medicine to improve her condition

329
00:39:16.788 --> 00:39:17.706
Re-open sleeping pills

330
00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:19.166
If she is still sleepwalking

331
00:39:19.249 --> 00:39:20.792
Don't wake her up immediately

332
00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:22.461
Please take her picture

333
00:39:22.544 --> 00:39:24.171
We can use to analyze symptoms

334
00:39:25.672 --> 00:39:26.339
it is good

335
00:39:30.927 --> 00:39:35.849
# Sick # sleep
a lot # declined visit

336
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.958
I heard you want to come, 
I'll pick up something instrument

337
00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:05.545
This should be done to send you

338
00:40:12.552 --> 00:40:14.513
When I see you
reminds me of the instrument

339
00:40:14.596 --> 00:40:17.516
I don't know what she is alive

340
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:19.392
What will I do now?

341
00:40:19.476 --> 00:40:20.644
Enough, Mom

342
00:40:21.061 --> 00:40:23.104
The instrument has been dead for 20 years

343
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.232
She may have been reborn

344
00:40:25.857 --> 00:40:29.361
Into the wealthy daughter, lived comfortably

345
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:31.279
More comfortable than me

346
00:40:31.738 --> 00:40:33.782
Mom, only you can't let go

347
00:40:35.742 --> 00:40:37.619
As for this contract...

348
00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:38.662
It's okay

349
00:40:40.997 --> 00:40:42.207
But the number can't

350
00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:47.546
Now the land in this
area has risen a lot

351
00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:49.422
Probably tenfold

352
00:40:51.258 --> 00:40:53.843
Have you seen the status of that building?

353
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.472
Construction spending and devaluation must be counted

354
00:40:58.473 --> 00:40:59.599
You know it too

355
00:41:00.475 --> 00:41:03.186
Our dad only finished 60% of the project

356
00:41:04.437 --> 00:41:06.856
I try to give you the highest amount

357
00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:09.192
Since it is so
troublesome, don't get up again

358
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.610
Trouble is dead, too hard to do

359
00:41:12.654 --> 00:41:13.405
Ao

360
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.240
Don't be excited

361
00:41:16.366 --> 00:41:17.909
Wen is like family

362
00:41:18.076 --> 00:41:20.036
Price can't be higher anymore

363
00:41:21.288 --> 00:41:22.789
But if you want more

364
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.917
I can give you 10% of the profits

365
00:41:30.297 --> 00:41:32.007
Profit dividend?

366
00:41:32.424 --> 00:41:34.175
What if you don't make money?

367
00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.093
I can't get the slightest bit

368
00:41:36.094 --> 00:41:36.845
Right?

369
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.306
How do I know if
you will keep your promise?

370
00:41:41.558 --> 00:41:44.185
You know I can't
understand the number of discs

371
00:41:50.275 --> 00:41:51.443
Then you are free

372
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.862
and many more

373
00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:59.492
Well, I am out
of respect for our father

374
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.287
Not like this

375
00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:07.917
If you can give me
your bonus as you said

376
00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:10.295
Then deal it

377
00:42:11.588 --> 00:42:13.048
This contract is good enough

378
00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:15.008
The price can be negotiated

379
00:42:26.895 --> 00:42:28.480
Belle took sleeping pills

380
00:42:28.563 --> 00:42:31.024
9:00 to go to bed

381
00:42:31.232 --> 00:42:33.151
So far no sleepwalking

382
00:42:50.126 --> 00:42:52.671
If you are hungry, there
is a salad in the fridge

383
00:42:53.588 --> 00:42:56.341
I will ask you
to go later than usual

384
00:42:56.758 --> 00:42:59.135
Until I'm sure Belle no longer sleepwalking

385
00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:07.060
Problems?

386
00:43:07.061 --> 00:43:10.355
I saw a piece of Belle's sleepwalking

387
00:43:11.064 --> 00:43:13.440
Do you think she is just sleepwalking?

388
00:43:13.441 --> 00:43:14.567
of course

389
00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:18.947
Yes, ma'am

390
00:43:48.435 --> 00:43:51.895
Wen and instrument

391
00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:55.483
"happy Birthday"

392
00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:34.499
Are you coming alone?

393
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:44.717
come in

394
00:46:24.465 --> 00:46:25.633
me too

395
00:46:28.553 --> 00:46:29.512
really?

396
00:46:31.931 --> 00:46:32.974
where is it?

397
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.937
How long have you been there?

398
00:46:40.148 --> 00:46:41.649
Beautiful scenery

399
00:46:45.445 --> 00:46:47.071
Are you lonely?

400
00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:39.999
How long have you known with my mom?

401
00:48:01.437 --> 00:48:02.563
What do you stand there?

402
00:48:37.432 --> 00:48:45.023
Don't want to see anything,
don't want to see the sky

403
00:48:45.314 --> 00:48:51.279
My eyes want to rest forever

404
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.868
Belle!

405
00:49:05.918 --> 00:49:09.088
"Wednesday"

406
00:49:10.256 --> 00:49:11.716
Did I sleep around last night?

407
00:49:14.343 --> 00:49:15.595
Have you recorded it?

408
00:49:18.973 --> 00:49:20.141
No

409
00:49:20.641 --> 00:49:22.643
You don't sleep long time

410
00:49:22.852 --> 00:49:23.853
Ugh…

411
00:49:23.936 --> 00:49:26.773
The doctor said sleepwalking symptoms will eventually disappear

412
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:32.862
I have obediently take
medicine, how will still sleepwalking?

413
00:49:35.323 --> 00:49:36.157
mom

414
00:49:36.616 --> 00:49:39.077
I want to cancel Saturday's birthday party

415
00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:42.997
I kind of only a
panda 咁, video will be ugly

416
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:46.626
Ok

417
00:49:47.502 --> 00:49:49.796
Wait for you to fill it up again

418
00:49:50.963 --> 00:49:52.632
Want me to send you a birthday present?

419
00:49:53.674 --> 00:49:54.716
Alright

420
00:49:54.717 --> 00:49:56.677
My phone is broken

421
00:49:57.595 --> 00:49:59.847
Can I send my new
cell phone as a birthday present?

422
00:50:00.598 --> 00:50:03.893
Try it if you don't believe it

423
00:50:04.143 --> 00:50:06.896
Lights will always flash when the ring

424
00:50:07.313 --> 00:50:08.064
look

425
00:50:08.815 --> 00:50:09.774
like this

426
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:13.945
Thank you

427
00:51:16.424 --> 00:51:17.466
instrument…

428
00:51:19.886 --> 00:51:22.346
I'm sorry for leaving you that day

429
00:51:24.473 --> 00:51:26.684
I did not come
back to see you later

430
00:51:30.396 --> 00:51:31.939
From now on…

431
00:51:32.398 --> 00:51:34.942
I will do more good
deeds and often pray for you

432
00:51:38.696 --> 00:51:39.822
but…

433
00:51:43.492 --> 00:51:45.203
Can you please put my daughter?

434
00:52:08.351 --> 00:52:11.229
1,2,3, shark live

435
00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:14.899
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

436
00:52:15.358 --> 00:52:18.402
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

437
00:52:18.945 --> 00:52:22.114
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

438
00:52:25.618 --> 00:52:26.786
What's wrong, Amon?

439
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.417
Wait!

440
00:52:39.507 --> 00:52:40.216
and many more!

441
00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:42.593
what happened?

442
00:52:43.219 --> 00:52:44.470
Why do you run away?

443
00:52:45.304 --> 00:52:46.889
I ask you, what did you see?

444
00:52:49.976 --> 00:52:51.978
She is behind you

445
00:52:55.898 --> 00:52:56.565
Who?

446
00:52:57.775 --> 00:52:58.317
who is it?

447
00:52:58.567 --> 00:52:59.652
Who are you talking about?

448
00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:00.820
I ask you, who are you talking about?

449
00:53:01.112 --> 00:53:01.654
answer me!

450
00:53:01.737 --> 00:53:02.363
What do you mean?

451
00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:03.281
Who?

452
00:53:03.364 --> 00:53:04.407
Sorry

453
00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:06.742
The child into a messing story

454
00:53:06.826 --> 00:53:09.036
Please ignore him

455
00:54:08.095 --> 00:54:09.055
Belle

456
00:54:12.016 --> 00:54:13.559
What are you looking for?

457
00:54:15.644 --> 00:54:16.604
Belle?

458
00:54:18.731 --> 00:54:20.066
big scissors

459
00:54:20.816 --> 00:54:22.234
Right there

460
00:54:23.194 --> 00:54:24.737
your mom

461
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.073
I asked the scissors to close

462
00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:29.492
It's all here

463
00:54:35.956 --> 00:54:37.750
Belle, you scared me

464
00:54:37.917 --> 00:54:38.751
Give you

465
00:54:39.752 --> 00:54:42.380
You run out and ask
you to put the scissors back

466
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.715
I am going to go to the market

467
00:55:47.653 --> 00:55:48.529
it is good

468
00:55:48.946 --> 00:55:50.030
I am up now

469
00:55:50.865 --> 00:55:51.907
Is Belle still awake?

470
00:55:53.033 --> 00:55:55.119
Go to the market and go quickly

471
00:56:39.163 --> 00:56:40.498
"Alive is meaningless..."

472
00:56:52.927 --> 00:56:54.178
"Alive is meaningless, 
I am going to the building waiting for you."

473
00:57:05.397 --> 00:57:07.858
Miss Pa, you have a registered letter

474
00:57:39.974 --> 00:57:40.641
Belle?

475
00:57:41.267 --> 00:57:41.934
Belle!

476
00:57:44.186 --> 00:57:45.521
Belle!

477
00:57:46.564 --> 00:57:47.606
What happened?

478
00:57:47.982 --> 00:57:49.275
Are you OK?

479
00:57:51.026 --> 00:57:52.611
Inhale, take a deep breath

480
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.032
mom…

481
00:58:00.035 --> 00:58:01.328
Where did you get it from?

482
00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:03.247
I obviously have thrown away

483
00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:13.716
I remember that…

484
00:58:16.302 --> 00:58:18.137
At that time I
was almost 15 years old

485
00:58:20.764 --> 00:58:22.683
That is our impulsive decision

486
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.936
We want to commit suicide together

487
00:58:26.645 --> 00:58:28.272
So that everything can end

488
00:58:32.901 --> 00:58:34.445
But after the instrument committed suicide

489
00:58:36.655 --> 00:58:37.740
I'm scared

490
00:58:40.784 --> 00:58:42.244
She left her like this

491
00:58:44.163 --> 00:58:46.332
I did not tell anyone about it

492
00:58:47.082 --> 00:58:48.250
Did not even tell her mother

493
00:58:57.843 --> 00:58:58.677
mom…

494
00:59:00.888 --> 00:59:01.930
This Saturday

495
00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:04.099
I am about 15 years old

496
00:59:07.853 --> 00:59:09.730
As old as you were then

497
00:59:11.398 --> 00:59:12.316
Belle

498
00:59:13.942 --> 00:59:15.736
This matter has nothing to do with you

499
00:59:16.195 --> 00:59:16.862
Belle

500
00:59:17.112 --> 00:59:18.197
look at me

501
00:59:18.405 --> 00:59:19.406
Hear me out

502
00:59:19.698 --> 00:59:21.283
You can't do anything

503
00:59:22.868 --> 00:59:23.869
I am here

504
00:59:24.703 --> 00:59:25.871
Belle, look at me

505
00:59:26.455 --> 00:59:27.915
Mom, I'm so scared

506
00:59:27.998 --> 00:59:29.375
Calm down

507
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.043
Can I stay with you?

508
00:59:31.126 --> 00:59:32.795
Don't mess around

509
00:59:33.212 --> 00:59:33.962
Belle

510
00:59:34.421 --> 00:59:36.298
Mom, I really die?

511
00:59:36.924 --> 00:59:39.635
I will not let anyone hurt you

512
00:59:39.927 --> 00:59:41.553
Please help me

513
01:00:03.158 --> 01:00:04.201
Hurts?

514
01:00:05.619 --> 01:00:06.829
do you know?

515
01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:09.415
I'm actually good for you

516
01:00:10.165 --> 01:00:12.126
I caught in this dilemma

517
01:00:13.794 --> 01:00:16.130
Although all this has
nothing to do with me

518
01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:21.510
But I think back

519
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.349
You are not suicide right

520
01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:36.567
mom

521
01:00:37.443 --> 01:00:38.819
Can you promise me?

522
01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:42.322
From now on no matter what happens

523
01:00:42.614 --> 01:00:44.324
You can't give up life

524
01:00:44.992 --> 01:00:47.369
Don't have the idea of suicide

525
01:00:51.874 --> 01:00:52.541
it is good

526
01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:55.753
I promise you

527
01:00:57.838 --> 01:01:00.507
Adults are shaking hands

528
01:01:59.316 --> 01:01:59.983
Belle

529
01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:02.194
Belle...

530
01:02:08.367 --> 01:02:09.076
Belle...

531
01:02:09.535 --> 01:02:10.619
Why do you do this?

532
01:02:12.663 --> 01:02:13.831
I really want to sleep

533
01:02:20.045 --> 01:02:21.046
Nothing, good girl

534
01:02:21.755 --> 01:02:22.714
Go to sleep

535
01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:23.674
I will accompany you

536
01:02:27.803 --> 01:02:28.554
Belle

537
01:02:29.888 --> 01:02:30.639
Belle

538
01:02:32.432 --> 01:02:37.312
"Thursday"

539
01:02:37.729 --> 01:02:39.940
The doctor helped her inject the medicine

540
01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:42.359
Let her rest will be better

541
01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.238
no matter what happens

542
01:02:46.947 --> 01:02:48.949
Don't let her leave your sight

543
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.993
If you want to
go or do other things

544
01:02:51.076 --> 01:02:52.536
You have to find someone to replace you

545
01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:55.038
If she woke up

546
01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:56.039
Call me right away

547
01:02:56.123 --> 01:02:57.416
rest assured

548
01:02:57.457 --> 01:02:59.042
We gave her sleeping pills

549
01:02:59.084 --> 01:03:00.586
She will wake up long after she sleeps

550
01:03:00.627 --> 01:03:02.087
If you don't understand me

551
01:03:02.504 --> 01:03:04.047
I'll look for someone
to take care of her

552
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:08.719
understood

553
01:03:16.768 --> 01:03:18.353
I'll be back soon

554
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:32.492
What did you tell me yesterday?

555
01:03:34.202 --> 01:03:36.121
Do you really see her?

556
01:03:41.043 --> 01:03:43.545
What does she look like?

557
01:03:43.712 --> 01:03:44.755
I am also not certain

558
01:03:45.464 --> 01:03:46.715
I am scared to see

559
01:03:47.382 --> 01:03:48.675
Only saw one

560
01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:50.135
Girl wearing a red dress

561
01:03:53.013 --> 01:03:54.514
Can you take me to find her?

562
01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.518
Please let him go

563
01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:04.983
I beg you!

564
01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:06.818
As long as he helps me

565
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:09.029
I am willing to give you a reward

566
01:04:09.696 --> 01:04:11.448
Not a question of money

567
01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:13.742
I'm worried he will be short and long

568
01:04:13.825 --> 01:04:16.536
Please don't force him to do it

569
01:04:16.662 --> 01:04:17.913
Please, my wife

570
01:04:24.586 --> 01:04:26.463
How many people in their home work here?

571
01:04:28.382 --> 01:04:29.341
8 people

572
01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:34.471
All will be expelled tomorrow

573
01:04:35.722 --> 01:04:36.598
Miss Pal

574
01:04:38.433 --> 01:04:39.685
Please calm down

575
01:04:40.769 --> 01:04:42.062
Think twice

576
01:04:43.855 --> 01:04:45.273
please

577
01:04:45.357 --> 01:04:48.443
Please don't fire us,
we have nowhere to go

578
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.736
it is good

579
01:04:55.617 --> 01:04:56.910
I'll take you

580
01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:03.792
what!

581
01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:09.589
Are you hurt?

582
01:05:11.883 --> 01:05:15.679
I'm not really going to fire your family

583
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.306
But I really have no choice

584
01:05:18.807 --> 01:05:21.059
She is coming to claim my daughter

585
01:05:21.935 --> 01:05:23.562
Please help me this favor

586
01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:53.133
what happened?

587
01:06:13.445 --> 01:06:15.030
Nothing, Amon

588
01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.011
who is it?

589
01:06:41.848 --> 01:06:42.641
Natty

590
01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.935
There are workers in the building site?

591
01:06:45.894 --> 01:06:46.812
No

592
01:06:47.229 --> 01:06:49.356
As your bidding evacuated everyone

593
01:06:54.027 --> 01:06:54.694
instrument

594
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:56.196
is it you?

595
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:04.496
where are you?

596
01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:36.695
instrument

597
01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.780
Kind of come out

598
01:08:27.787 --> 01:08:28.538
Amon, wait!

599
01:08:28.747 --> 01:08:29.581
don't go!

600
01:08:29.915 --> 01:08:31.499
Help me pass it to her

601
01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:33.210
please

602
01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.095
instrument

603
01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:47.224
is it you?

604
01:08:51.519 --> 01:08:52.646
Is it instrument?

605
01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:16.253
instrument…

606
01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:21.091
Can you put my daughter?

607
01:09:22.342 --> 01:09:24.511
Can you let her daughter?

608
01:09:37.315 --> 01:09:38.483
I beg you, instrument

609
01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.403
This thing has nothing to do with Belle

610
01:09:42.445 --> 01:09:43.655
Please stop pestering her again

611
01:09:44.739 --> 01:09:47.284
Do you want to
give life to her daughter?

612
01:09:54.249 --> 01:09:55.583
Injustice, debt owners

613
01:09:56.042 --> 01:09:57.043
I'm sorry to you

614
01:09:57.085 --> 01:09:59.087
If you want revenge, find me

615
01:10:08.263 --> 01:10:09.139
Where has she been?

616
01:10:09.931 --> 01:10:10.974
where is she?

617
01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:12.767
I don't know

618
01:10:21.234 --> 01:10:21.901
Amon

619
01:10:23.236 --> 01:10:23.903
Amon!

620
01:10:25.071 --> 01:10:25.864
Are you OK?

621
01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:30.910
Let go!

622
01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:32.662
I'm going, I am so scared!

623
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:34.456
Amon

624
01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:35.665
Amon!

625
01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.000
Amon!

626
01:10:43.465 --> 01:10:44.257
Amon, it's me

627
01:10:44.299 --> 01:10:45.675
let me go!

628
01:10:45.717 --> 01:10:46.634
Amon, it's me

629
01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.178
Amon!

630
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:49.346
it's me

631
01:10:49.637 --> 01:10:50.638
I can't do it…

632
01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:52.682
Can not help you anymore

633
01:10:52.724 --> 01:10:53.558
Of course you can

634
01:10:53.975 --> 01:10:55.685
Please help me, I beg you

635
01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:56.478
please

636
01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.355
Your daughter is going to die anyway

637
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:00.315
Don't!

638
01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:02.233
My daughter can't die!

639
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:04.194
My daughter will not die!

640
01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:20.627
Amon

641
01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.795
What do you see, Amon?

642
01:11:22.796 --> 01:11:23.463
Amon

643
01:11:23.838 --> 01:11:24.798
What's wrong, Amon?

644
01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:31.137
enough!

645
01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:32.972
I am so scared, 
I don't want to help you again

646
01:11:33.264 --> 01:11:34.766
Mom saves me!

647
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.059
So scary!

648
01:11:36.142 --> 01:11:37.394
Nothing to be scared of

649
01:11:37.602 --> 01:11:39.562
Amon, calm down

650
01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:40.355
Amon...

651
01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:41.606
All right

652
01:11:41.648 --> 01:11:42.357
Amon

653
01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.859
Calm down, don't be afraid

654
01:11:45.819 --> 01:11:47.570
I'll take you back to find your mother

655
01:11:47.654 --> 01:11:49.197
Don't be afraid

656
01:11:49.322 --> 01:11:50.198
Nothing will happen

657
01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.128
I am sorry

658
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:15.348
"Friday"

659
01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:16.141
Wen

660
01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:18.726
What's wrong?

661
01:12:20.979 --> 01:12:21.771
aunt

662
01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:24.941
Can I talk to you?

663
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.861
Miss Pa, what's the problem?

664
01:12:29.154 --> 01:12:30.321
This is a private matter

665
01:12:34.742 --> 01:12:36.035
I think we should...

666
01:12:37.245 --> 01:12:39.372
I have something important to tell you

667
01:12:53.595 --> 01:12:55.388
You have something to say to my mom, 
I should also be there

668
01:13:05.732 --> 01:13:06.608
aunt…

669
01:13:09.027 --> 01:13:10.278
I am sorry

670
01:13:15.867 --> 01:13:16.576
Wen...

671
01:13:17.744 --> 01:13:18.786
what's up?

672
01:13:19.913 --> 01:13:21.247
tell me

673
01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:25.585
That day…

674
01:13:29.547 --> 01:13:30.673
Instrument suicide...

675
01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:37.805
I asked her out

676
01:13:39.933 --> 01:13:42.185
We made an appointment to commit suicide

677
01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:45.063
But I am scared

678
01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:46.940
I ran away

679
01:13:47.565 --> 01:13:49.192
How do you tell us now?

680
01:13:49.275 --> 01:13:51.236
After 20 years

681
01:14:00.662 --> 01:14:01.663
just now…

682
01:14:03.122 --> 01:14:04.874
Instrument came back to fulfill my promise

683
01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:10.630
My daughter is 15 tomorrow

684
01:14:13.925 --> 01:14:15.593

Let go!

695
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.413
Mom, let's go home

696
01:14:49.836 --> 01:14:51.087
Wait, wait a minute

697
01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:52.422
What happened to the contract?

698
01:14:52.463 --> 01:14:53.214
Cancel it

699
01:14:53.673 --> 01:14:55.383
The reason to ask your boss

700
01:14:55.675 --> 01:14:56.301
Go away!

701
01:14:56.342 --> 01:14:56.884
and many more

702
01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:57.844
I told you to go away

703
01:14:57.885 --> 01:14:58.469
Speak slowly

704
01:14:58.511 --> 01:14:59.637
Mom, let's go

705
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.062
Miss Pal

706
01:15:08.146 --> 01:15:09.439
Belle disappeared

707
01:15:09.522 --> 01:15:10.398
Missing?

708
01:15:11.691 --> 01:15:12.483
how come?

709
01:15:12.859 --> 01:15:16.696
She locked me up
and escaped from the hospital

710
01:15:16.821 --> 01:15:18.323
what? say it again

711
01:15:18.656 --> 01:15:22.076
She locked me up and ran away

712
01:15:23.036 --> 01:15:24.662
I'll be right there

713
01:15:24.829 --> 01:15:26.706
Immediately notify me when I find her

714
01:15:26.873 --> 01:15:28.124
Ok

715
01:15:35.214 --> 01:15:36.758
Mom, save me

716
01:15:37.425 --> 01:15:39.469
I don't know where I
am when I wake up

717
01:15:39.677 --> 01:15:41.512
It is not a hospital here

718
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:43.640
Belle

719
01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:45.350
calm down

720
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:46.976
Say it slowly

721
01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:50.104
Where are you?

722
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.315
don't know

723
01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:55.818
This is a dark room

724
01:15:56.069 --> 01:15:57.737
Look around you

725
01:15:57.945 --> 01:15:58.905
what did you see?

726
01:15:59.405 --> 01:16:00.198
Belle

727
01:16:00.281 --> 01:16:02.116
Old things are everywhere

728
01:16:02.367 --> 01:16:04.452
Grandpa and grandmother photos

729
01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:06.537
And your childhood photo with them

730
01:16:24.722 --> 01:16:25.515
Belle?

731
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.524
"Parvijan Ryan Vichaya"

732
01:16:34.607 --> 01:16:35.566
mom…

733
01:18:21.631 --> 01:18:22.882
"Thank you, Miss Palin."

734
01:18:22.924 --> 01:18:25.593
"I've been taking care of
me since I was a kid."

735
01:18:25.676 --> 01:18:26.886
I wish you peace and health

736
01:18:26.928 --> 01:18:29.263
"Please stay with me until I get married."

737
01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:30.306
"Love your Belle"

738
01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:00.336
mom

739
01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:01.963
I want to pee

740
01:19:09.053 --> 01:19:10.054
Will it hurt?

741
01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:11.889
Will it be too tight?

742
01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:16.477
Belle

743
01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:20.481
Belle!

744
01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:31.534
Belle

745
01:19:31.742 --> 01:19:32.368
stop

746
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:33.077
Belle

747
01:19:33.119 --> 01:19:33.786
I told you to stop

748
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:34.453
Belle

749
01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:35.788
Stop!

750
01:19:40.668 --> 01:19:41.335
Belle

751
01:19:41.961 --> 01:19:42.545
Belle

752
01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:43.212
Please stop!

753
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:44.297
Belle

754
01:20:02.315 --> 01:20:03.065
You're back?

755
01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:08.613
Please enter

756
01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:35.640
No, Belle!

757
01:20:36.015 --> 01:20:36.974
No!

758
01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:38.351
I want to go with you

759
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.977
Wait for me

760
01:20:40.019 --> 01:20:41.020
Belle, no

761
01:20:41.896 --> 01:20:43.856
Instrument, don't haunt my daughter again

762
01:20:43.898 --> 01:20:44.899
Let her go!

763
01:20:44.982 --> 01:20:46.692
Please, I beg you

764
01:20:46.776 --> 01:20:48.736
Instrument, don't take her away

765
01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:51.906
1,2,3, shark live

766
01:20:51.989 --> 01:20:54.158
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

767
01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:56.369
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

768
01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:58.621
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

769
01:20:58.704 --> 01:21:01.082
1,2,3, shark live

770
01:21:01.332 --> 01:21:03.834
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

771
01:21:03.918 --> 01:21:06.253
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

772
01:21:06.337 --> 01:21:08.714
10, hanging you hung
up to your eyes wet

773
01:21:09.006 --> 01:21:11.425
1,2,3, shark live

774
01:21:11.509 --> 01:21:13.719
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

775
01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:20.851
Please stop

776
01:21:20.935 --> 01:21:22.019
Let go!

777
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.479
I told you to let go!

778
01:21:23.771 --> 01:21:24.814
No, Belle

779
01:21:24.855 --> 01:21:27.274
If I die, it is you harm

780
01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:28.109
Don't move

781
01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:29.068
It's your fault!

782
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:30.569
stop! I told you
to let go of me!

783
01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:31.696
I call you stop!

784
01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:32.405
let me go!

785
01:21:32.446 --> 01:21:34.490
Quiet!

786
01:21:37.284 --> 01:21:38.619
I am sorry

787
01:21:56.303 --> 01:21:57.179
mom

788
01:21:58.639 --> 01:21:59.807
Don't you sleep?

789
01:22:13.821 --> 01:22:14.655
mom

790
01:22:15.239 --> 01:22:16.407
what happened?

791
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:18.784
Please relax for me

792
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:26.500
mom

793
01:22:28.002 --> 01:22:28.878
I am Belle ah

794
01:22:44.518 --> 01:22:46.604
Aunt Zhu came soon

795
01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:50.024
Nothing to be scared of

796
01:23:00.701 --> 01:23:01.619
mom…

797
01:23:02.536 --> 01:23:03.329
mom

798
01:23:04.288 --> 01:23:05.998
I beg you to come back

799
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:51.961
Enough, instrument

800
01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:57.466
In the face of father bankruptcy

801
01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:02.972
Remember how angry we are?

802
01:24:04.431 --> 01:24:06.767
Although we are powerless

803
01:24:08.519 --> 01:24:10.062
Don't you remember?

804
01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:16.360
Why do you hurt my daughter?

805
01:24:16.569 --> 01:24:17.736
mom!

806
01:24:19.905 --> 01:24:22.032
Those who have not
kept their promise are me

807
01:24:22.616 --> 01:24:24.660
You should come to me

808
01:24:28.164 --> 01:24:31.208
"Belle, don't forget how much
I love you / mom."

809
01:24:34.587 --> 01:24:36.964
Mom, don't leave me

810
01:24:54.607 --> 01:24:55.524
hateful!

811
01:24:59.028 --> 01:25:00.446
I want to fulfill our promise

812
01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:01.906
What do you want?

813
01:25:02.489 --> 01:25:04.116
Although everything is my beginning

814
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.327
But who is not you want to die?

815
01:25:21.008 --> 01:25:22.509
Is this really what you want?

816
01:25:24.386 --> 01:25:24.929
Ok

817
01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:41.737
Wen, don't shoot

818
01:25:43.239 --> 01:25:45.032
Wen

819
01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:46.492
Please don't hurt me

820
01:25:47.034 --> 01:25:47.701
instrument…

821
01:25:48.786 --> 01:25:50.496
Do you really want me to die?

822
01:25:50.704 --> 01:25:52.665
Then I'll send your mom to funeral

823
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.291
This matter has nothing
to do with my mom

824
01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:55.501
The meter is dead

825
01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:56.418
Correct

826
01:25:56.502 --> 01:25:58.712
You died a long time!

827
01:25:58.879 --> 01:26:01.298
Don't haunt my daughter!

828
01:26:03.008 --> 01:26:03.676
Don't!

829
01:26:16.897 --> 01:26:18.607
Hand closed okay?

830
01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:19.441
Okay?

831
01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:20.526
Wen, please don't hurt me

832
01:26:20.651 --> 01:26:21.402
Beg you, Wen

833
01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:23.112
I ask you close your hand?

834
01:26:23.362 --> 01:26:24.196
Answer I am so good!

835
01:27:25.632 --> 01:27:26.759
never mind

836
01:27:33.807 --> 01:27:39.229
"on Saturday"

837
01:27:43.650 --> 01:27:46.570
Are you going to commit suicide?

838
01:27:48.072 --> 01:27:49.365
how do you know…

839
01:27:49.948 --> 01:27:51.825
I will be safe after your death?

840
01:27:55.162 --> 01:27:56.622
Her goal is me

841
01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.089
If I die

842
01:28:05.756 --> 01:28:06.757
She will give up

843
01:28:23.023 --> 01:28:23.774
Belle

844
01:28:31.365 --> 01:28:32.157
Belle...

845
01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:41.792
Why do you do this?

846
01:28:44.044 --> 01:28:44.795
mom

847
01:28:45.462 --> 01:28:46.004
shell…

848
01:28:49.383 --> 01:28:50.092
Belle...

849
01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:54.012
Please don't do that

850
01:28:54.847 --> 01:28:55.806
Belle

851
01:28:56.932 --> 01:28:58.642
Why do you do this?

852
01:28:58.725 --> 01:29:01.353
You know how much I love you, right?

853
01:29:02.646 --> 01:29:04.148
Please don't bother me

854
01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:07.526
As long as tonight, you may be fine

855
01:29:07.818 --> 01:29:09.194
You may be fine

856
01:29:30.924 --> 01:29:31.967
You are coming, right?

857
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.477
Don't scare me, I hate it

858
01:29:41.768 --> 01:29:43.228
If you want me
to die, take me away

859
01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.606
Let my mother let it go!

860
01:30:27.356 --> 01:30:27.981
Hey?

861
01:30:28.232 --> 01:30:29.107
Which building?

862
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:30.817
Abandoned Sathorn Building, is it?

863
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:31.568
Correct

864
01:30:31.985 --> 01:30:33.487
Sathorn building

865
01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.781
Please send an ambulance immediately

866
01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.049
Belle

867
01:31:20.784 --> 01:31:22.411
Belle...

868
01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:54.401
Belle...

869
01:31:57.154 --> 01:31:58.030
Belle!

870
01:32:32.773 --> 01:32:33.523
Belle

871
01:33:35.544 --> 01:33:36.920
Tonight will die!

872
01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:38.380
I want to die because of you!

873
01:33:56.815 --> 01:33:57.482
Belle...

874
01:33:58.358 --> 01:33:59.067
Belle!

875
01:34:08.034 --> 01:34:08.702
Belle...

876
01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:26.845
Belle...

877
01:34:30.307 --> 01:34:30.932
Belle

878
01:34:39.065 --> 01:34:39.608
instrument

879
01:34:40.192 --> 01:34:41.860
Instrument, don't do this

880
01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:42.903
I beg you

881
01:34:48.158 --> 01:34:49.618
Don't let me die alone

882
01:34:50.327 --> 01:34:51.328
promise me

883
01:34:52.496 --> 01:34:53.121
instrument!

884
01:34:53.205 --> 01:34:55.290
instrument! Don't!

885
01:34:55.582 --> 01:34:56.625
happy Birthday

886
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.084
Instrument, stop hand!

887
01:34:58.126 --> 01:34:59.085
Don't!

888
01:35:22.108 --> 01:35:22.651
Belle!

889
01:35:22.692 --> 01:35:23.610
stop!

890
01:35:23.693 --> 01:35:24.402
Belle!

891
01:35:25.111 --> 01:35:26.822
Give me the gun!

892
01:35:34.746 --> 01:35:35.622
Don't!

893
01:35:49.344 --> 01:35:50.053
instrument

894
01:35:50.887 --> 01:35:52.389
I bet you dare not shoot at me

895
01:35:52.931 --> 01:35:54.224
bring it on! Kill me!

896
01:35:54.266 --> 01:35:55.183
shot!

897
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:55.994
Belle

898
01:38:28.712 --> 01:38:29.462
Belle

899
01:38:29.879 --> 01:38:31.172
Belle, can you hear it?

900
01:38:45.228 --> 01:38:45.854
Belle

901
01:38:45.979 --> 01:38:47.731
never mind

902
01:38:47.772 --> 01:38:49.190
Someone will come to save you right away

903
01:38:49.482 --> 01:38:51.568
You have to withstand

904
01:38:51.735 --> 01:38:53.069
Help!

905
01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:54.571
Help!

906
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:56.573
Help!

907
01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:07.292
Bullet removed

908
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:11.212
However, the injured brain was seriously injured

909
01:39:12.672 --> 01:39:16.176
Patients must rely on equipment to survive

910
01:39:17.218 --> 01:39:19.387
Even if you choose to continue treatment

911
01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.515
The patient can't fully recover

912
01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:24.786
I am sorry

913
01:40:26.329 --> 01:40:28.164
Let you wait so long

914
01:41:50.705 --> 01:41:53.917
Belle

915
01:42:14.812 --> 01:42:15.730
instrument

916
01:42:16.814 --> 01:42:19.025
Really sorry

917
01:42:20.818 --> 01:42:22.904
We will meet again one day

918
01:42:27.283 --> 01:42:28.826
But not like this

919
01:42:33.164 --> 01:42:34.666
anyway…

920
01:42:38.169 --> 01:42:39.921
I will not commit suicide

921
01:42:41.464 --> 01:42:45.468
Belle

922
01:42:53.309 --> 01:42:55.311
I fulfilled my promise

923
01:43:06.322 --> 01:43:08.783
Belle, you can't give up

924
01:43:50.408 --> 01:43:52.243
Miss Pa, everything okay?

925
01:44:03.296 --> 01:44:05.506
I just heard about your daughter

926
01:44:05.673 --> 01:44:06.716
Unfortunately

927
01:44:09.427 --> 01:44:10.261
Conscious

928
01:44:11.554 --> 01:44:13.263
This box was originally placed in the closet

929
01:44:13.264 --> 01:44:14.724
Do you want to take it?

930
01:44:16.267 --> 01:44:17.101
thank you

931
01:44:38.956 --> 01:44:41.376
Hello, Miss Palin, can you hear it?

932
01:44:42.877 --> 01:44:43.920
I'm Belle

933
01:44:45.004 --> 01:44:45.880
I don't know

934
01:44:45.922 --> 01:44:48.674
What happens to my birthday?

935
01:44:50.218 --> 01:44:52.970
But I want to
tell you I love you

936
01:44:57.725 --> 01:44:59.769
I love you all over the world

937
01:45:01.896 --> 01:45:03.689
But you must be strong

938
01:45:04.273 --> 01:45:07.610
I hope you feel happy
every time I think of it

939
01:45:10.238 --> 01:45:12.323
Even though I may not be with you

940
01:45:13.991 --> 01:45:16.202
I will always guard you far

941
01:45:19.622 --> 01:45:21.958
Sorry for using your cassette to bring recordings

942
01:45:21.999 --> 01:45:23.292
That's it, Mom

943
01:45:23.334 --> 01:45:24.168
Goodbye

944
01:45:28.548 --> 01:45:29.590
Let me help

945
01:45:30.591 --> 01:45:31.926
You come back early

946
01:45:33.803 --> 01:45:37.181
I changed my diaper and
fed her twice with a syringe

947
01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:39.809
Trouble you

948
01:45:40.309 --> 01:45:41.269
You're welcome

949
01:45:42.145 --> 01:45:44.105
I'll go first and see you next time

950
01:45:50.153 --> 01:45:51.821
How are you, good girl?

951
01:45:53.948 --> 01:45:57.493
Do you know what I found today?

952
01:46:02.582 --> 01:46:03.291
look

953
01:46:04.584 --> 01:46:06.461
Who allows you to bring this cassette recording?

954
01:46:06.794 --> 01:46:08.880
This is Platinum Edition

955
01:46:09.130 --> 01:46:10.673
I can't find it now

956
01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:19.182
Thank you anyway

957
01:46:23.311 --> 01:46:24.937
I will always be strong

958
01:46:29.650 --> 01:46:31.402
Belle, please get well soon

959
01:46:39.202 --> 01:46:40.578
I'll pour water to you

960
01:46:48.794 --> 01:46:50.630
Why are you holding my hand tight?

961
01:46:51.172 --> 01:46:52.298
Don't want me to go?

962
01:47:00.681 --> 01:47:01.390
Belle?

963
01:47:05.811 --> 01:47:07.355
Belle, can you hear it?

964
01:47:12.610 --> 01:47:13.986
If you can hear it

965
01:47:15.947 --> 01:47:18.032
Just squeeze my hand twice

966
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:30.100
