Congratulations on

55
00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:03.400
and I'm so sorry
to all of you who missed out


56
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.070
because every painting
has already sold.


57
00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:08.538
So can we just...

58
00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.508
Can we just
cut this stuffy shit out


59
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.510
and really fucking party?

60
00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.118
Ah, I'm going to need you
to take that whole thing.


61
00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:23.587
Uh, no. I'm trying not

before my sister gets here.

63
00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.159
She's finally coming
to one of these things.


64
00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.627
How come
I've never met your sister?


65
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:31.829
Um, I don't know.

66
00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.998
I mean, she doesn't
get out a whole lot.


67
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.781
You know what?

68
00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:54.018
Oh, yes. That's my girl.

69
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:55.953
- She's back!
- Give me another one. Give me another one.


70
00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:57.989
Deejay, turn that shit up!

71
00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:37.028
- What is it?
- Does it matter?


72
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:12.163
Oh, shi...

73

I'm sorry, I am...

74
00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:16.599
Oh, it's...

75
00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:18.936
it's bathtub gin.

76
00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:20.603
Get it?

77
00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.006

Bathtub...

79
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:25.843
Do you want some?

80
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:51.634
Excuse me.

81
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.139
Hello?

82
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.110

Yeah, we're coming down.

88
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.958
Yeah, we'll be there

89
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:17.695
I'm just waiting for my husband
to get out of the bathroom.


90
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:22.900
Can I make that two?

- You know my mom...
- Oh, careful.


115
00:07:38.742 --> 00:07:41.112
I can't believe this is
happening tonight,


116
00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:43.180
because I thought we were
going to meet at some point


117
00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:44.748
and then it was tonight.

118
00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:45.950
Really?

119
00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:47.852
Oh my God.
You're a...


120
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.253
You're a lot heavier
than you look.


121
00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.321
- Yeah.
- Yep.


122
00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:54.391
You're the perfect height
to be my best friend.


123
00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:01.365
Were'd you learn how to...

00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:07.738
So now we go down.

133
00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.041

137
00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:54.385
I gotta go the...
other way.


138
00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:57.021
- But you...
- You're not coming?


139
00:08:57.054 --> 00:08:58.889
Okay. Feel better.

140
00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:00.758
Your feet...
Are your feet?


141
00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:03.327
Okay.

No, no, no, no, no.

144
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.111
Shit.

145
00:09:37.428 --> 00:09:39.096
Hello?

146
00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:20.230

Hey, man.

148
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:25.969
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, wait a minute.


149
00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:28.339
Hey, man.

150
00:11:28.372 --> 00:11:29.506
Dude.

151
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.108
What the fuck.
Don't lock me in.


152
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:32.242

the number of...</i>


163
00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:09.166
<i>So is it alright
if I record our interview?</i>


164
00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:11.068
<i>Jane?</i>

165
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.604
<i>Jane?</i>

166
00:14:13.637 --> 00:14:14.806
Huh?

167
00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:17.675
Is it all right
if I record our interview?


168
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.745
Yeah.

169
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.312
Yeah.

170
00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:26.684
All right.

171
00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:30.387
Did you recognize
your attacker?


172
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.356
Was it somebody
that you knew,


173
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:35.760
or maybe you had met
or even just seen at the party?


174
00:14:35.793 --> 00:14:38.195
No, no, no.

175
00:14:38.228 --> 00:14:41.733
I mean,
I didn't really get a good look,


176
00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:44.501
but it was like a...

177
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:48.806
It was um,

178
00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:51.341
I don't...

179
00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:53.443
It's okay.
Just take your time.


180
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.212
Just try to remember.

181
00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:01.719
<i>There was this smell
and flies...</i>


182
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.622
I don't really remember.

183
00:15:08.191 --> 00:15:10.662
It's really common

184
00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:12.730
in instances like this,

185
00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:15.432
for things to be
a little bit fuzzy at first,


186
00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:16.801
and that's okay.

187
00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:19.570
Our bodies have a way
of storing memories


188
00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:22.472
in different parts of our brain
after experiencing trauma,


189
00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.876
so things might, you know,

190
00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:28.445
feel a little out of order
or come back to you slowly.


191
00:15:29.646 --> 00:15:30.782
- Okay.
- All you have to do


192
00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:34.786
is just try your best to
remember anything that you can.


193
00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:36.888
And I promise you,

194
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:40.157
I'll do my best
to catch this guy.


195
00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:44.595
Um...

196
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.165
He pushed down

197
00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.500
and I tried to push it off,

198
00:15:50.802 --> 00:15:52.436
and then...

199
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.877
<i>I got stuck in
something sticky and hot.</i>


200
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.446
And then...

201
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:05.449
And then, um...

202
00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:08.285
<i>something was burning my wrist,</i>

203
00:16:08.318 --> 00:16:10.587
<i>um, some...
I couldn't move my legs,</i>


204
00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:12.790
<i>my whole body
went paralyzed.</i>


205
00:16:12.824 --> 00:16:14.859
<i>And then I... 
I screamed.</i>

206
00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:18.195
I think I screamed.

207
00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:21.298
<i>I tried to but the sound
wouldn't come out.</i>


208
00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:23.533
You know, like when
you're stuck in a dream.


209
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.435
You're doing really well,
Jane.


210
00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:28.205
Do you need a minute
or you're ready to keep going?


211
00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:29.741
Just keep going.

212
00:16:30.207 --> 00:16:32.242
Can you try to describe

213
00:16:32.275 --> 00:16:34.478
the attacker
a little bit more to me?


214
00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:38.582
Uh, it was like shredding it,

215
00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:43.286
<i>like, tearing at my dress
and I was just laying there.</i>


216
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.922
<i>Why was I just laying there?</i>

217
00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:46.691
It was...

218
00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:48.525
<i>It was definitely
going to kill me.</i>


219
00:16:48.558 --> 00:16:51.495
<i>I remember thinking,
this is it, this is how I die.</i>


220
00:16:54.364 --> 00:16:56.566
<i>Then there was this light.</i>

221
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.736
It was like a bright light

222
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.504
<i>that scared it,</i>

223
00:17:00.537 --> 00:17:02.239
that scared it away.

224
00:17:03.306 --> 00:17:05.409
Why do you keep
using the word "it"


225
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.612
to describe the attacker.

226
00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:11.716
Um...

227
00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:15.252
It's okay.

228
00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:19.423
Don't say another word
until we get you a lawyer.


229
00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.258
I'm sorry, ma'am,
this is a closed interview.


230
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.360
- Absolutely not.
- It's okay, this is my sister.


231
00:17:23.393 --> 00:17:25.262
I'm her sister and you're
not legally authorized


232
00:17:25.262 --> 00:17:26.664
to continue questioning her
once the presence of a lawyer


233
00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:28.465
- has been requested.
- There's no need for a lawyer


234
00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:30.001
because she's not
being questioned.


235
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.904
Your sister
was the victim of an assault.


236
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.277
I'm okay.

237
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.848
I'm... I'm going to keep talking
to the detective, okay?


238
00:17:46.718 --> 00:17:48.920
- It's okay.
- Okay.


239
00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:49.887
I'll keep you updated

240
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:52.322
on any developments
in the investigation.


241
00:17:52.355 --> 00:17:55.292
But if there's anything
that you can think of


242
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.461
or if Jane remembers anything,

243
00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.429
please don't hesitate
to contact me.


244
00:17:59.463 --> 00:18:00.865
Thank you.

245
00:18:04.634 --> 00:18:06.336
Oh, uh, one more thing,

246
00:18:07.537 --> 00:18:09.406
has Jane been in
some sort of trouble?


247
00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:11.042
You seemed very concerned
with getting her a lawyer


248
00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:12.509
when you came in.

249
00:18:13.477 --> 00:18:15.312
She's just been through a lot.

250
00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:40.865
Oh shit.
You scared me.


251
00:19:40.898 --> 00:19:43.968
Sorry, sorry.

252
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:45.870
I'm going to go
jump in the shower.


253
00:19:45.903 --> 00:19:48.105
Do you want me to drop you
off on my way to work?


254
00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:49.539
You're sweet.

255
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:52.009
I'll take you up on that,
Officer.


256
00:19:52.043 --> 00:19:53.543
Detective.

257
00:20:22.106 --> 00:20:23.607
Hey, what are you doing?

258
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.475
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. Um...


259
00:20:25.508 --> 00:20:27.812
You can't go snooping
through my stuff.


260
00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:29.981
Look, I need to bring my work
home with me sometimes,


261
00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:31.148
and if it's too
tempting for you,


262
00:20:31.182 --> 00:20:32.183
then maybe
you shouldn't stay here.


263
00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:33.650
No, no.

264
00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:35.887
It's just I know
you were on call last night.


265
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.724
You came home,
all worked up, and it's scary.


266
00:20:39.757 --> 00:20:42.159
- That poor girl...
- This is the first time the department's given me


267
00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:44.095
the lead on
a big case like this,


268
00:20:44.128 --> 00:20:46.130
and I just...

269
00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:48.733
I really need to blow them
out of the water, you know.


270
00:20:50.902 --> 00:20:53.570
I don't want you to worry, okay.

271
00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:54.906
It's going to be okay.

272
00:20:55.639 --> 00:20:58.042
So have a little bit
of faith in me, alright.


273
00:21:00.144 --> 00:21:03.047
<i>So I think it's too late
to cancel this open house.</i>


274
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.684
<i>I would, but I already feel like
I might be losing some clients.</i>


275
00:21:06.717 --> 00:21:08.653
<i>I'll come straight
back after work,</i>


276
00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:11.521
<i>but for now, we'll get you
set up in your own space</i>


277
00:21:11.554 --> 00:21:13.523
<i>and you can get some rest,
okay.</i>


278
00:21:13.556 --> 00:21:16.761
Because I think right now sleep
is the best thing for you.


279
00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:18.495
Yeah.

280
00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.197
Are you sure
you don't want me to stay?


281
00:21:21.165 --> 00:21:23.500
No, no, I'm fine.

282
00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:28.739
Okay.

283
00:21:31.508 --> 00:21:33.044
You're going to need some food.

284
00:21:39.582 --> 00:21:41.652
I forgot
you don't have a fridge.


285
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.627
Okay.

286
00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:55.900
So...

287
00:21:57.802 --> 00:22:00.671
the doctors said
to take these


288
00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:02.539
if you're having
trouble sleeping.


289
00:22:13.918 --> 00:22:15.152
You wanna move to the bed?

290
00:22:15.186 --> 00:22:18.555
No.
Sis, seriously.


291
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.992
I'm fine.

292
00:22:34.672 --> 00:22:36.741
Jane, I'm so sorry
that this has happened to you.


293
00:22:36.774 --> 00:22:38.075
I am fine, really.

294
00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:40.878
No, you're not fine.

295
00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:43.147
And that's okay.

296
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:48.252
Okay, listen.

297
00:22:48.285 --> 00:22:51.789
I really appreciate you

298
00:22:51.822 --> 00:22:53.590
coming to the hospital.

299
00:22:54.692 --> 00:22:55.826
I really do.

300
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.796
You were...
You were amazing.


301
00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:01.899
But I don't really
want to dwell on this.


302
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.268
You know?

303
00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:07.104
I mean, it could have been
a lot worse,


304
00:23:07.138 --> 00:23:09.639
so I say we just go
back to our lives, seriously.


305
00:23:09.673 --> 00:23:10.941
Jane.

306
00:23:13.077 --> 00:23:14.912
I'm here for you, okay?

307
00:23:15.746 --> 00:23:17.214
Whatever you need.

308
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.318
Yeah, thanks.

309
00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:35.099
Well, okay.
Um, I'm going to go to work.


310
00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:38.869
I'll pick you up some
groceries when I get back.


311
00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:42.973
Oh, can we do
Chinese instead?


312
00:23:43.007 --> 00:23:44.108
I kinda feel like I'm gonna want

313
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:46.177
some General Tso's
chicken later?


314
00:23:46.643 --> 00:23:48.946
- Hmm?
- Sure. Whatever.


315
00:23:48.979 --> 00:23:50.281
Whatever you want.

316
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:52.016
- Awesome.
- Yeah.


317
00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:13.771
Just try to get some sleep,
okay?


318
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:20.277
Yeah. No,
it shouldn't be a problem.


319
00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:45.256
<i>Hey, it's Jane.</i>

320
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:47.858
<i>I don't check these,
but do your thing.</i>


321
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.061
Well, I hope you
check your email


322
00:26:51.095 --> 00:26:52.529
because I sent you
a bunch of therapists,


323
00:26:52.563 --> 00:26:54.398
that I think
you would really like


324
00:26:54.431 --> 00:26:57.034
and I know you said
you wanted to move on,


325
00:26:57.067 --> 00:27:00.537
but I just think
it won't be like last time.


326
00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:04.074
So...

327
00:27:04.108 --> 00:27:06.877
Oh, I have to go.
I'll call you. Bye.


328
00:27:07.911 --> 00:27:08.979
- Hi.
- Hi.


329
00:27:09.013 --> 00:27:10.281
- How was it?
- It was good.


330
00:27:10.314 --> 00:27:11.482
- Yeah?
- It was good. Yeah.


331
00:27:11.515 --> 00:27:15.152
Okay, well, let me give you,
let me give you one of these


332
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:18.289
and just give me a call.

333
00:27:18.322 --> 00:27:20.090
- That's my information right there.
- Thanks.


334
00:27:20.124 --> 00:27:22.893
And um, you know, if you
want to come see it again,


335
00:27:22.926 --> 00:27:25.462
I'm happy to show you again
and we can talk more details.


336
00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:27.564
Yeah, I got it.
No problem. Thank you.


337
00:27:27.598 --> 00:27:29.166
Yeah, thank you.
Have a good one.


338
00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:30.567
You didn't have any
questions or...


339
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.369
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.


340
00:27:32.403 --> 00:27:34.471
Alright.
Well, drive safe.


341
00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:37.107
Enjoy the sunny weather.

346
00:28:21.085 --> 00:28:25.055
Hey. Uh, how fast can you get
ECT van down here


347
00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:26.190
to the Toy District?

348
00:28:26.223 --> 00:28:28.325
I'm pretty sure I'm looking at
a secondary crime scene.


349
00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:50.447
Jane?

350
00:29:03.728 --> 00:29:05.229
Jane?

351

354
00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:53.644
Um, I reported to the police.

355
00:29:53.678 --> 00:29:57.247
They took photos of my injuries.

356
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.186
I went through the whole
process, the whole thing.


357
00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:05.022
And that should
make me feel better.


358
00:30:06.123 --> 00:30:09.460
It should make me
feel empowered.


359
00:30:11.729 --> 00:30:13.230
But it doesn't.

360

Hey. Jane. Jane.

Jesus Christ, it's just me!

That's not what I'm saying,
I'm just...


380
00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:13.825
I'm saying that you
definitely shouldn't be


381
00:31:13.858 --> 00:31:17.160
publishing your personal
email address on the internet.


382
00:31:17.662 --> 00:31:19.731
Well, how else
are they going to contact me?


383
00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:21.766
Why would you
want them to contact you?


384
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.102
Did you see the video?

385
00:31:25.102 --> 00:31:26.303
Yes.

386
00:31:26.503 --> 00:31:27.839
Did you call that therapist yet?

387
00:31:27.872 --> 00:31:29.239
Oh my God.

388
00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:30.842
You need to focus
on your own recovery.


389
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:33.110
- That is what I'm doing.
- Is it?


390
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.111
Yeah.

391
00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:37.715
I'm sorry, I'm just having
a very difficult time


392
00:31:37.749 --> 00:31:42.252
wrapping my brain around
the video or whatever.


393
00:31:42.286 --> 00:31:43.520
Shocker.

394
00:31:44.288 --> 00:31:46.791
Why would you want people
to know what happened to you?


395
00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:51.495
Because I don't want
anyone else to get hurt.


396
00:31:51.528 --> 00:31:52.830
Okay.

397
00:31:52.864 --> 00:31:54.732
I understand that,

398
00:31:54.766 --> 00:31:59.136
but what you're doing,
it's reckless.


399
00:31:59.169 --> 00:32:01.706
You're opening yourself up
to more dangerous situations,


400
00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:03.741
you have to take
responsibility


401
00:32:03.775 --> 00:32:06.476
because if you're going
to live a certain way...


402
00:32:09.146 --> 00:32:10.347
What?

403
00:32:10.915 --> 00:32:13.183
No, no, please go on.

404
00:32:13.216 --> 00:32:16.320
If I'm going to live
a certain way...


405
00:32:16.353 --> 00:32:17.588
You know what I mean?

406
00:32:18.455 --> 00:32:19.456
No.

407
00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:22.159
No, I don't.

408
00:32:23.695 --> 00:32:25.529
You drink, you party.

409
00:32:25.562 --> 00:32:26.898
Oh, here we go.

410
00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:28.733
We've worked so hard
to get this far,


411
00:32:28.766 --> 00:32:30.601
you need to have
some common sense.


412
00:32:30.634 --> 00:32:32.837
- You walk home alone at night.
- Oh my God.


413
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.638
Are you saying
that I deserve this?


414
00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:37.240
No. No, I'm not saying that.

415
00:32:37.274 --> 00:32:38.676
What happened to you
was a terrible, terrible thing.


416
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.644
Just because I don't
have a blood diamond


417
00:32:40.678 --> 00:32:41.746
on my finger.

418
00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:43.480
A normal nine to five

419
00:32:43.513 --> 00:32:45.582
and a boring 3-2
in fucking Englewood,


420
00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:47.284
- does not mean that I deserve that.
- I'm so sorry,


421
00:32:47.317 --> 00:32:48.820
that I worked hard
and saved up money,


422
00:32:48.853 --> 00:32:49.921
- and bought a house.
- Just because I'm not like you


423
00:32:49.954 --> 00:32:51.089
doesn't mean
that I deserve this.


424
00:32:51.188 --> 00:32:53.624
- I'm not the one on trial here.
- You think you're better?


425
00:32:55.258 --> 00:32:56.493
You're not better.

426
00:32:58.462 --> 00:33:01.899
We come from the same
shit slog of a childhood.


427
00:33:01.933 --> 00:33:03.567
So I drank.

428
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.202
I party.

429
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.505
Sorry, I can't dress up
my fucked up in J. Crew


430
00:33:08.538 --> 00:33:11.208
and play house
like a good little girl.


431
00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:13.310
But you know what?

432
00:33:15.545 --> 00:33:17.347
Everyone knows.

433
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:20.584
You're not fooling anyone.

434
00:33:23.453 --> 00:33:26.724
If you don't like
the therapist I recommended,


435
00:33:26.758 --> 00:33:29.493
I can send you a list
of really great ones.


436
00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:30.594
All in the neighborhood.

437
00:33:30.627 --> 00:33:34.932
I don't want
a fucking therapist?


438
00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:37.567
I want to move on.

439
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:39.536
How is this moving on?

440
00:33:40.237 --> 00:33:43.240
You're broadcasting
to strangers on the internet


441
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.609
and drawing an incredible
amount of attention to yourself.


442
00:33:45.642 --> 00:33:48.612
- You're so unfair.
- You're basking in it.


443
00:33:48.645 --> 00:33:50.447
That's the exact opposite
of moving on,


444
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.849
even pulling this shit
since we were kids.


445
00:33:51.883 --> 00:33:52.984
I am helping people.

446
00:33:53.017 --> 00:33:55.318
These people
don't deserve your help.


447
00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:56.788
Oh my God.

448
00:33:56.821 --> 00:33:59.389
Have you read their comments?

449
00:33:59.423 --> 00:34:00.858
They're saying
terrible things about you.


450
00:34:00.892 --> 00:34:02.492
Who gives a shit?

451
00:34:03.061 --> 00:34:04.796
You're looking into your past.

452
00:34:06.396 --> 00:34:08.265
There's stuff about
Mom on there.


453
00:34:09.734 --> 00:34:11.334
What about Mom?

454
00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:20.644
Hello.

455
00:34:22.046 --> 00:34:23.480
Yeah, this is Jane.

456
00:34:26.483 --> 00:34:28.720
Yeah. No, that's,
that sounds great.


457
00:34:28.753 --> 00:34:30.387
I, um...

458
00:34:30.888 --> 00:34:32.522
No, I would be honored.

459
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.694
Oh, I... I don't know
how brave it is.


460
00:34:36.728 --> 00:34:38.830
I'm just doing
what I think is right.


461
00:34:40.597 --> 00:34:42.332
Yeah. Great.

462
00:34:43.801 --> 00:34:45.670
Yep, I'll be there.
Okay.


463
00:34:49.606 --> 00:34:53.845
Well those YouTube haters
can fuck off


464
00:34:53.878 --> 00:34:56.346
because I'm going to
get to say my piece.


465
00:34:57.447 --> 00:34:58.582
What?

466
00:34:58.615 --> 00:35:00.852
Tomorrow night
on <i>Goodnight L.A.</i>


467
00:35:00.885 --> 00:35:03.420
Guess who
is the guest of honor?


468
00:35:03.755 --> 00:35:05.022
This guy.

469
00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:07.390
Primetime interview.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.464
<i>I'm gonna work through dinner.</i>

478
00:35:47.497 --> 00:35:48.365
<i>Miss you.</i>

479
00:37:12.616 --> 00:37:13.751
Hello.

480
00:37:14.517 --> 00:37:15.853
This is Jane.

481
00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:20.457
Am I in trouble?

482
00:37:23.828 --> 00:37:24.929
What's up?

483
00:37:26.463 --> 00:37:28.132
Nothing. It's just
out of all the times


484
00:37:28.165 --> 00:37:29.767
I've ever called somebody
down to the precinct.


485
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.068
I've never had
an innocent person


486
00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:32.770
ask if they were in trouble.

487
00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:37.174
You told me...

488
00:37:37.607 --> 00:37:39.944
Jane, you told me that you were
attacked around 1:00 a.m.


489
00:37:39.977 --> 00:37:42.980
Why didn't you just tell me in
your own words, what happened?


490
00:38:16.814 --> 00:38:17.982
Can you stop that?

491
00:38:20.718 --> 00:38:22.053
Okay, Jane,

492
00:38:22.086 --> 00:38:23.988
let's just take it
from the top, okay.


493
00:38:24.021 --> 00:38:26.691
Can you go over the events
of your evening two nights ago?


494
00:38:26.724 --> 00:38:27.792
Why are you
making me do this?


495
00:38:27.825 --> 00:38:30.061
You have it all written down
right in front of you.


496
00:38:30.094 --> 00:38:31.829
Because it's difficult
to get the department


497
00:38:31.862 --> 00:38:33.798
to allocate funds
for a full investigation


498
00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:35.032
on cases like this.

499
00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:37.068
It's difficult to
get a conviction.


500
00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:39.937
If you could just help me
clarify some things then...


501
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:41.604
Okay. Clarify what?

502
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.942
There's some inconsistencies
with your story.


503
00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:48.545
- Like what?
- Like, for example, your whereabouts.


504
00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:50.948
You told me that you were
heading home around 1:00 a.m.


505
00:38:50.982 --> 00:38:52.917
from a warehouse party
at 4th and Central, right?


506
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.616
Mm-hmm.

507
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.220
So here it shows that you made

508
00:38:56.253 --> 00:39:00.623
a couple of purchases
at 1:17 a.m. and 1:52 a.m.


509
00:39:00.658 --> 00:39:02.660
at bars in Korea Town.

510
00:39:02.693 --> 00:39:05.229
That's a lot closer to the
hospital where we met at,


511
00:39:05.262 --> 00:39:06.797
which is over here.

512
00:39:06.831 --> 00:39:09.767
And I'm just I'ml just
trying to connect the dots.


513
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.704
How did you get
from here to the hospital?


514
00:39:13.738 --> 00:39:16.573
- What?
- How did you get to the hospital?


515
00:39:16.606 --> 00:39:17.908
Because there's three others

516
00:39:17.942 --> 00:39:20.111
within closer walking
distance over here.


517
00:39:20.577 --> 00:39:22.279
So did you take a car

518
00:39:22.313 --> 00:39:24.614
or did you have somebody
drop you off at the hospital?


519
00:39:24.647 --> 00:39:26.684
I don't...

520
00:39:27.617 --> 00:39:29.586
I just...
I can't really...


521
00:39:30.888 --> 00:39:33.691
This is the results of
your toxicology screening


522
00:39:33.724 --> 00:39:35.760
that says is that
you had cocaine, MDMA


523
00:39:35.793 --> 00:39:37.094
and methamphetamine
in your system


524
00:39:37.128 --> 00:39:38.863
in addition to the alcohol.

525
00:39:38.896 --> 00:39:40.164
I did not do meth.

526
00:39:40.197 --> 00:39:42.066
Well, it ended up
in your system somehow.


527
00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:43.234
I took a pill.

528
00:39:44.068 --> 00:39:47.204
And I just thought it was
regular ecstasy or whatever,


529
00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:48.706
but it must have been
laced with something.


530
00:39:48.739 --> 00:39:49.940
Yeah,
it must have been.


531
00:39:49.974 --> 00:39:53.310
The point is you never mentioned
this to me in our interview,


532
00:39:53.344 --> 00:39:54.912
I went back
and listened to all the tapes


533
00:39:54.945 --> 00:39:57.281
and there was no mention
of the little pill.


534
00:39:57.314 --> 00:39:59.116
So why would you
withhold that form me?


535
00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.185
Why would I neglect
to tell an officer of the law


536
00:40:01.218 --> 00:40:03.988
that I spent the evening
dabbling in illegal drugs.


537
00:40:04.021 --> 00:40:06.157
Yeah. Illegal drugs that
can cause you to hallucinate


538
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.658
or see things that aren't there.

539
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:08.726
To exaggerate your story?

540
00:40:08.759 --> 00:40:11.262
I mean, this could get
the entire case thrown out.


541
00:40:11.295 --> 00:40:12.296
What?

542
00:40:17.001 --> 00:40:18.969
No. That's bullshit.

543
00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:20.237
I was attacked.

544
00:40:26.043 --> 00:40:27.812
No, I was attacked.

545
00:40:27.845 --> 00:40:29.914
I was at...
I was attacked.


546
00:40:34.218 --> 00:40:35.219
Jane?

547
00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:39.757
I need you to think
long and hard


548
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.591
about what you say here.

549
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.729
I want to help you,
but you have to tell the truth.


550
00:40:50.101 --> 00:40:52.103
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?


551
00:40:57.775 --> 00:40:59.276
What about these abrasions?

552
00:41:00.711 --> 00:41:02.079
How did you get these?

553
00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:07.017
Did you fall

554
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:10.221
or maybe you got in
a little scuffle at the party?


555
00:41:10.254 --> 00:41:14.325
They took swabs
and cultures.


556
00:41:14.758 --> 00:41:16.760
You have DNA evidence.

557
00:41:19.263 --> 00:41:20.931
We're not
going to be running that


558
00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:23.100
unless we know
that there's an actual suspect


559
00:41:23.134 --> 00:41:24.368
that we should be looking for.

560
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:25.336
What are you talking about?

561
00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:30.007
Jane, the department
has a backlog of 13,000


562
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.976
physical evidence recovery kits.

563
00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:34.411
Each one costs $800 to run.

564
00:41:34.445 --> 00:41:36.881
That's 13 times...

565
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:38.849
It's over $10 million.

566
00:41:39.416 --> 00:41:41.318
So unless you can convince me

567
00:41:41.352 --> 00:41:45.256
that there is a perpetrator
that we should be looking for,


568
00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:47.024
I'm not going to waste manpower

569
00:41:47.057 --> 00:41:50.394
and tax dollars
to bump you up in the queue.


570
00:41:51.762 --> 00:41:53.097
You know what?

571
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.134
Fuck you.

572
00:41:59.103 --> 00:42:01.305
The prosecutor
is going to imply


573
00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:03.274
that these wounds
are self-inflicted.


574
00:42:07.378 --> 00:42:09.813
Fuck you.

575
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:12.349
You are supposed
to be protecting me.


576
00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:15.753
I came here for help

577
00:42:15.753 --> 00:42:17.054
and to try to stop this thing,

578
00:42:17.087 --> 00:42:18.956
and you're treating me
like a fucking criminal.


579
00:42:18.989 --> 00:42:20.191
Okay.

580
00:42:20.224 --> 00:42:22.393
Just calm down, okay.
We're not done here.


581
00:42:22.426 --> 00:42:23.761
Yes, we are.

582
00:42:24.128 --> 00:42:25.396
Sit down.

583
00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:26.463
Am I under arrest?

584
00:42:26.497 --> 00:42:28.098
- No, but we...
- Then we're done.


585
00:42:31.902 --> 00:42:33.470
So I went to the cops again,

586
00:42:33.504 --> 00:42:37.341
and once again they are
doing jack shit for me.


587
00:42:41.445 --> 00:42:43.047
- <i>Just what.</i>
- She's back.


588
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.149
<i>Somebody take this
seriously for once.</i>


589
00:42:45.182 --> 00:42:46.450
<i>Do your fricking job,</i>

590
00:42:46.483 --> 00:42:48.786
<i>is that so much to ask for?</i>

591
00:42:50.921 --> 00:42:53.457
<i>And can somebody
please explain to me why</i>


592
00:42:54.425 --> 00:42:58.862
<i>It should matter
if I'm having to drink or...</i>


593
00:42:58.896 --> 00:43:00.931
Always matters, damn.

594
00:43:00.965 --> 00:43:04.401
<i>I'm nervous to even post
anything about this, actually,</i>


595
00:43:04.435 --> 00:43:06.470
<i>because I'm sure
all the little trolls</i>


596
00:43:06.503 --> 00:43:08.339
<i>will have heyday with it,
but...</i>


597
00:43:08.872 --> 00:43:11.208
<i>Like, why are you checking
my credit card statements</i>


598
00:43:11.242 --> 00:43:13.444
<i>when I'm the one
that was attacked?</i>


599
00:43:14.411 --> 00:43:15.813
What now?

600
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.952
<i>Hang on a second, guys.
I'm having some car trouble.</i>


601
00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:39.303
That's just what I need.

602
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.908
<i>Great.</i>

603
00:43:45.843 --> 00:43:49.446
Ladies and gentlemen
and my non-binary beauties,


604
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.948
May I present to you...

605
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.918
a flat tire.

606
00:43:58.188 --> 00:43:59.356
<i>Let's do this.</i>

607
00:44:00.057 --> 00:44:01.258
Okay.

608
00:44:07.264 --> 00:44:09.333
All right, for those
of you still with me,


609
00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:12.436
if there's anything I've learned
in the last couple of days,


610
00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:14.471
it's that you have to be
self-sufficient


611
00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:18.242
because even on
the worst day of your life,


612
00:44:18.275 --> 00:44:22.146
no matter how much of a damsel
in distress you may actually be,


613
00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:24.014
chances are no one's
coming to save you.


614
00:44:24.048 --> 00:44:26.583
So for tonight's
lesson in autonomy,


615
00:44:26.617 --> 00:44:28.218
changing a tire.

616
00:44:28.252 --> 00:44:30.921
Step one,
loosen before you lift.


617
00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:36.894
All right,
so we're trying to do this


618
00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:38.395
when your car's up on a jack,

619
00:44:38.429 --> 00:44:40.331
the wheel is just going
to spin around and round.


620
00:44:40.364 --> 00:44:43.934
But if you do it
while it's on the ground...


621
00:44:43.967 --> 00:44:45.469
Woo!

622
00:44:45.502 --> 00:44:49.073
Look at that,
nice and loose.


623
00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.515
You put this guy in here,

624
00:44:58.982 --> 00:45:02.386
and then we just hoist
this bad boy up.


625
00:45:04.922 --> 00:45:05.456
Alright.

626
00:45:06.924 --> 00:45:08.258
So...

627
00:45:09.093 --> 00:45:10.494
Alright.

628
00:45:10.527 --> 00:45:15.432
Now we are going
to take the tire off.


629
00:46:05.616 --> 00:46:08.720
Lesson number two in autonomy.

630
00:46:08.753 --> 00:46:10.587
Keep the receipts.

631
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:17.327
That way, no one
can accuse you of lying.


632
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:20.297
Now this next part
is really important


633
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.234
so I just need you to all pay
really close attention.


634
00:46:24.268 --> 00:46:25.469

What the fuck.

Okay, thanks.

What?

689
00:55:13.898 --> 00:55:15.232
That cut is new

690
00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.135
and you got a big bruise
on your eye.


691
00:55:20.705 --> 00:55:21.906
What's going on?

692

Okay, I know I sound crazy,

693
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:31.282
but there's... there's
an actual monster after me.


694
00:55:31.315 --> 00:55:34.551
I don't know. It's got like,
teeth and claws


695
00:55:34.584 --> 00:55:37.554
and the hold deal like,
straight out of a fucking movie.


696
00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:40.157
And at first I didn't really,
I didn't really remember.


697
00:55:40.191 --> 00:55:42.059
But then I started
having flashbacks


698
00:55:42.093 --> 00:55:43.661
and weird dreams.

699
00:55:43.694 --> 00:55:44.929
And then last night,
I swear to God,


700
00:55:44.962 --> 00:55:46.664
I'm driving home
from the police station


701
00:55:46.697 --> 00:55:48.598
and I hit it
with my fucking car.


702
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:50.134
I got a good look at it and...

703
00:55:51.335 --> 00:55:52.470
There's my girl.

704
00:55:52.569 --> 00:55:54.805

705
00:55:54.839 --> 00:55:55.873
Okay.

706
00:55:56.741 --> 00:55:58.608
I know this is
going to be difficult.


707

708
00:56:01.278 --> 00:56:02.279
Yeah.

- That bitch?


728
00:57:04.041 --> 00:57:06.643
Well, I. I was arrested once

729
00:57:06.643 --> 00:57:09.146
for carrying
a dime bag of marijuana,


730
00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.183
but I thought that was the
great thing about California.


731
00:57:12.216 --> 00:57:14.752
I mean, we all know there's
nothing you can't cure


732
00:57:14.785 --> 00:57:19.223
with some yoga, avocados
and a little bit of weed, right?


733
00:57:19.256 --> 00:57:20.925
Very funny.

734
00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:22.827
All jokes aside, though,

735
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.095
that can't feel very good

736
00:57:24.128 --> 00:57:26.697
to have people
bringing up your past like that.


737
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.799
Look, I have admittedly been

738
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:31.235
a little bit of
a troublemaker in the past,


739
00:57:31.268 --> 00:57:33.871
but that's completely
irrelevant to the fact


740
00:57:33.904 --> 00:57:37.007
that I was hunted down
and violated.


741
00:57:37.408 --> 00:57:40.044
It's, it's also completely
irrelevant to the fact


742
00:57:40.077 --> 00:57:43.080
that the monster that did this
to me is still out there.


743
00:57:43.114 --> 00:57:44.849
It feels like
a huge step backwards


744
00:57:44.882 --> 00:57:47.384
for women to live in fear
of something as basic


745
00:57:47.418 --> 00:57:48.319
as a walk home at night.

746
00:57:48.352 --> 00:57:51.755
You know, honestly,
I am just terrified


747
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:53.891
that this is going to happen
to someone else.


748
00:57:54.892 --> 00:57:56.927
Monsters are real.

749
00:57:56.961 --> 00:58:00.197
We have to shed light
in all of the dark corners...


750
00:58:00.231 --> 00:58:03.234
Los Angeles has been
your home for a long time.


751
00:58:03.267 --> 00:58:04.101
Yeah.

752
00:58:04.135 --> 00:58:06.203
You were raised by
a single mother


753
00:58:06.237 --> 00:58:08.272
who was one of
the most prolific artists


754
00:58:08.305 --> 00:58:10.040
to come out of
the city at the time.


755
00:58:10.074 --> 00:58:11.709
Much like yourself.

756
00:58:12.877 --> 00:58:15.246
Um...
She was very talented,


757
00:58:15.279 --> 00:58:17.882
that's a kind of comparison.

758
00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:22.186
But much of her art was fueled
by her psychotic episodes.


759
00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:24.989
Is it true that she was
diagnosed with schizophrenia


760
00:58:25.022 --> 00:58:28.125
and committed when
you were just 14 years old?


761
00:58:29.093 --> 00:58:31.095
Um, she was very sick...

762
00:58:31.128 --> 00:58:32.897
That must have
just been terrible.


763
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:34.098
What she did to you

764
00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:36.734
must have had an immense effect
on the rest of your life.


765
00:58:37.768 --> 00:58:38.903
I don't really, I don'...

766
00:58:38.936 --> 00:58:41.939
<i>Police records show that
your mother was committed</i>


767
00:58:41.972 --> 00:58:44.175
<i>after she tried to drown you.</i>

768
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:55.319
I understand that you
were committed yourself


769
00:58:55.352 --> 00:58:56.253
at age 17,

770
00:58:56.287 --> 00:58:59.089
when you spent some time
at Hyacinth House,


771
00:58:59.123 --> 00:59:02.026
an inpatient facility
specializing in mental health


772
00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:04.228
and psychiatric rehabilitation.

773
00:59:04.261 --> 00:59:09.266
No, no,
I was um... that was for stress.


774
00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:14.238
I, I had just lost my mother
and I took some pills, and...


775
00:59:14.271 --> 00:59:15.773
You did what?

776
00:59:20.945 --> 00:59:23.914
<i>Is it possible you saw something
in common with your mother,</i>


777
00:59:23.948 --> 00:59:25.783
<i>beyond a love for art?</i>

778
00:59:28.252 --> 00:59:31.422
No, I, I was young and...

779
00:59:32.957 --> 00:59:34.858
Um...
Can we cut?


780
00:59:36.794 --> 00:59:39.330
Jane.
Jane, just calm down, okay.


781
00:59:39.363 --> 00:59:41.098
Just take a breath.
It's going to be fine.


782
00:59:41.131 --> 00:59:43.801
I'm not crazy.
I didn't make this up, okay?


783
00:59:43.834 --> 00:59:45.002
I'm not like Mom.

784
00:59:45.035 --> 00:59:46.103
I just need you
to take a beat


785
00:59:46.136 --> 00:59:47.805
before we talk to anyone else.

786
00:59:47.838 --> 00:59:50.507
Just get you
to the right doctor the time.


787
00:59:50.608 --> 00:59:51.809
Oh my God.

788
00:59:52.943 --> 00:59:54.245
You don't believe me.

789
00:59:59.083 --> 01:00:00.084
Jane.

790
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.321
What?

791
01:00:05.456 --> 01:00:07.791
Oh, I'm actually
glad you called.


792
01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:11.962
No, I was going to
say that the...


793
01:00:18.535 --> 01:00:21.005
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on my way.


794
01:00:21.538 --> 01:00:23.474
All right,
let's just get this typed up


795
01:00:23.507 --> 01:00:24.975
and have you sign
on the offer?


796
01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:28.112
Uh, you can wait there, Jane.

797
01:00:28.145 --> 01:00:29.313
I'll be right with you.

798
01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:49.133
We just got a visit
from a woman


799
01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:51.935
who signed a sworn affidavit
about your activities,


800
01:00:51.969 --> 01:00:53.570
the night of the crime.

801
01:00:53.604 --> 01:00:55.339
What, like a witness?

802
01:00:55.372 --> 01:00:57.041
Character witness.
Yeah.


803
01:00:57.074 --> 01:00:59.376
She claims that you
had extramarital affairs


804
01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:01.312
with her husband
in a bathroom


805
01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:04.415
moments before what would
have been the alleged attack.


806
01:01:04.615 --> 01:01:07.618
Wait. What do you mean
by alleged attack?


807
01:01:07.651 --> 01:01:08.585
The DNA evidence

808
01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:10.621
from the crime scene
came back inconclusive.


809
01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:12.222
I'm not making this up.

810
01:01:12.256 --> 01:01:14.558
Your story has changed
too many times, Jane.


811
01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:16.360
It changed
on national television,


812
01:01:16.393 --> 01:01:17.928
alienating any possible juror.

813
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:19.330
No, D.A.
is going to touch this case.


814
01:01:19.363 --> 01:01:20.264
I am not lying.

815
01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:21.899
Why would you go on
<i>Good Night. L.A.?</i>


816
01:01:21.899 --> 01:01:23.200
That bitch tricked me.

817
01:01:23.233 --> 01:01:25.069
Okay, sit down.

818
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.507
Shit.

819
01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:39.350
You want to know
what I think happened?


820
01:01:39.383 --> 01:01:41.251
I think you had
a few too many drinks.


821
01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:43.387
You took some drugs

822
01:01:43.822 --> 01:01:45.589
and you woke up
in the hospital.


823
01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:47.958
You were embarrassed.

824
01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:49.661
The hospital staff
starts asking questions,


825
01:01:49.694 --> 01:01:51.495
you just start answering.

826
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:54.231
The more you start talking,

827
01:01:54.264 --> 01:01:57.167
the more you develop
your story, this villain.


828
01:01:58.335 --> 01:01:59.937
The monster.

829
01:02:04.241 --> 01:02:07.111
And the bigger the monster got,

830
01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:09.179
the further away you got

831
01:02:09.213 --> 01:02:13.183
from taking responsibility
for what actually happened.


832
01:02:20.391 --> 01:02:22.025
I swear this is real.

833
01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:29.967
I am not, I am not
making this up, okay?


834
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.103
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the drugs,


835
01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:35.506
I guess I should have
told you about that guy,


836
01:02:35.539 --> 01:02:37.441
but you have to believe me.

837
01:02:37.474 --> 01:02:39.576
I just, I didn't think of it.

838
01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:44.682
It's like another life,
it's another person.


839
01:02:44.716 --> 01:02:47.050
There's this split in time,

840
01:02:47.084 --> 01:02:49.086
there's old Jane
on one side


841
01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:51.021
and new Jane
on the other side,


842
01:02:51.054 --> 01:02:53.490
just cracked
right down the middle.


843
01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:57.729
I don't recognize
myself anymore.


844
01:02:57.762 --> 01:02:59.630
You have to believe me.

845
01:03:01.064 --> 01:03:02.599
You have to believe.

846
01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:08.205
It's too late, Jane.

847
01:03:08.439 --> 01:03:09.674
No.

848
01:03:09.707 --> 01:03:11.442
I'm sorry.

849
01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:15.479
I need you
to write a statement.


850
01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:18.515
Saying that you
were under extreme duress


851
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:20.317
and that you
fabricated the incident,


852
01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:22.119
as originally reported.

853
01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:23.755
The judge will only
give you probation


854
01:03:23.788 --> 01:03:25.255
and maybe some mental
health counseling.


855
01:03:25.289 --> 01:03:26.758
I mean, I'll take
a lie detector test.


856
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.026
I can't just give you
a lie detector test, Jane.


857
01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:31.562
You're making this harder
than it has to be.


858
01:03:31.595 --> 01:03:35.265
Just say that you were confused

859
01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:38.368
that you're sorry
and we'll close the case.


860
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:43.106
I mean, you were there.

861
01:03:46.043 --> 01:03:49.046
You saw what this thing
did to me.


862
01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:03.060
Okay.

863
01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:06.196
Okay, I'll give you
a lie detector test.


864
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:07.564
But if you fail,

865
01:04:08.733 --> 01:04:10.501
I'm charging you
with false reporting,


866
01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:11.703
obstruction of justice,

867
01:04:11.736 --> 01:04:13.570
and I'll throw an assaulting
an officer for good measure.


868
01:04:13.604 --> 01:04:15.272
Fine. Yeah, whatever.

869
01:04:15.305 --> 01:04:17.074
Let's do it.
Let's take it.


870
01:04:19.543 --> 01:04:20.712
Okay.

871
01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.082
We're done here.

872

I don't have anyone else,
really.


888
01:05:43.594 --> 01:05:46.698
I will go to the fucking ends
of the Earth for you, Jane,


889
01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:49.166
even if you lie
about the whole thing.


890

I will lie with you.

891
01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:53.170
I just need to know.

892
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.273
I'm not making this up.

894
01:06:24.334 --> 01:06:25.703
Come with me.

895
01:06:27.972 --> 01:06:30.808

Yes.

897
01:06:33.878 --> 01:06:35.479
Are you aware

898

fabricating an assault
to any official police personnel


899

Jane doesn't live here.

Get off my property, please.

927
01:09:32.089 --> 01:09:34.692

A moon shaped scar?

929
01:09:40.497 --> 01:09:42.632
there's these online communities

all across the country,
like, across the world,


931

technology or whatever, but...

All of these women
are running or dead.


934
01:09:57.682 --> 01:10:02.687

is that it will be back

- <i>Hey, this is Jane.</i>

Uh, don't don't go home,
okay?


944
01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:33.918

945
01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:35.753
Oh, shit.

946

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.829
Is that a gun in your hand,
are you happy to see me?


951
01:11:18.863 --> 01:11:20.798
Get in here.
You're not supposed to be here.


952
01:11:28.172 --> 01:11:29.874
What are you doing?

953
01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:32.009
You can't do that,
I don't know if you noticed,


954
01:11:32.043 --> 01:11:34.644
but I'm actually
supposed to enforce the law.


955
01:11:34.679 --> 01:11:36.981
Oh, then arrest me, officer.

956
01:11:38.749 --> 01:11:40.751
It's Detective.

957
01:11:40.785 --> 01:11:43.520
Guess who got the
lead story on the 11 o'clock?


958
01:11:43.988 --> 01:11:44.989
Wow.

959
01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:50.627
Aren't you going
to congratulate me?


960
01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:52.663
<i>A local L.A. artist
and social media...</i>


961
01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.630
Congratulations.

962
01:11:53.664 --> 01:11:56.934
Well, I couldn't have done it
without you.


963
01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:04.574
<i>...She stands to
alienate almost a million fans,</i>

<i>her family and the police force
in the lie that she created.</i>


965
01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:11.248
<i>A lie the shape of a monster.</i>

966

<i>While the authorities
don't know what motivated Jane</i>


967

<i>to tell these lies,</i>

968
01:12:15.652 --> 01:12:17.989
<i>what I do know
is the case has been closed</i>


969
01:12:18.022 --> 01:12:19.690
<i>and Jane will face a court date</i>

970
01:12:19.724 --> 01:12:22.860
<i>where a judge will decide
the extent of her punishment.</i>


971
01:12:22.893 --> 01:12:25.062
<i>The charges include
false reporting</i>


972
01:12:25.096 --> 01:12:26.764
<i>and obstruction of justice.</i>

973
01:12:26.797 --> 01:12:28.631
<i>Jane to face hefty fines</i>

974
01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.968
<i>and pending
a psychiatric evaluation,</i>


975
01:12:31.002 --> 01:12:34.105
<i>she will also receive
court ordered psychotherapy.</i>


976
01:12:35.139 --> 01:12:37.975
<i>This seems to be the classic
case of the apple</i>


977
01:12:38.009 --> 01:12:40.177
<i>not falling too far
from the tree.</i>


978
01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:44.148
<i>There inability to distinguish
reality from fantasy</i>


979
01:12:44.181 --> 01:12:47.084
<i>may stem from her
immense trauma she suffered</i>


980
01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:48.585
<i>from the hands of her mother.</i>

981
01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:50.988
<i>A mother,
plagued with mental illness.</i>


982
01:12:51.022 --> 01:12:54.158
<i>Some assume the case
an elaborate publicity stunt,</i>


983
01:12:54.191 --> 01:12:57.594
<i>others maintain it to be
a sad and public display</i>


984
01:12:57.594 --> 01:13:00.664
<i>of the onset
of a genetic mental illness.</i>


985
01:13:00.698 --> 01:13:03.600
Okay. Stop, stop, stop.

986
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.668
<i>What we desperately need</i>

987
01:13:04.702 --> 01:13:06.771
<i>is now the least
law enforcement can do...</i>


988
01:13:06.804 --> 01:13:08.806
I can't do this.

989
01:13:08.839 --> 01:13:09.974
I need you
to get out of the car.


990
01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:12.910
<i>...outpouring for this woman
and a deep concern...</i>


991
01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:18.615
You can catch a bus right
up there in like, five minutes.


992
01:13:19.316 --> 01:13:20.684
The bus?

993
01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:24.889
Protect and serve, my ass!

994
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:26.623
Fuck you.

995
01:13:32.263 --> 01:13:34.832
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

996
01:13:34.865 --> 01:13:36.801
It's not real,
it's not real.


997
01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.969
It's not real. 
It's not real.

998
01:15:20.471 --> 01:15:22.139
No!

999
01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:05.182
No!

1000
01:16:08.986 --> 01:16:11.388
No! No, no, no, no...

1001
01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:28.245
No, no. No!

1002
01:20:35.486 --> 01:20:37.287
No.

1003
01:20:55.506 --> 01:20:57.474
No, no...

1004
01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.682
No!

1005
01:21:11.288 --> 01:21:12.690
Hey!

1006
01:21:24.334 --> 01:21:26.303
No means, no, motherfucker.

1007
01:21:35.747 --> 01:21:37.347
Okay, Jane.

1008
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:39.249
It's going to be okay.
Help is on the way.


1009
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.518
I can't feel my legs.

1010
01:21:41.552 --> 01:21:42.519
You're going to be okay.

1011
01:21:42.553 --> 01:21:45.155
I can't feel my legs.
I think it paralyzed me.


1012
01:21:45.188 --> 01:21:46.623
Just try to stay still, okay?

1013
01:21:46.658 --> 01:21:48.258
The medics are on their way.

1014
01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:54.298
You did it.

1015
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.532
They're all going to see now.

1016
01:21:57.568 --> 01:21:59.403
The knife.

1017
01:21:59.436 --> 01:22:01.204
- The knife, I need...
- Don't move.


1018
01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:02.774
I dropped the knife.

1019
01:22:02.807 --> 01:22:03.808
What?

1020
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:05.509
Only that can kill it.

1021
01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:09.814
You have to kill it
with the knife.


1022
01:22:09.847 --> 01:22:11.381
What?
What knife?


1023
01:22:57.662 --> 01:22:58.696
Jane!

1024
01:22:59.262 --> 01:23:00.732
Jane. Oh my God. Jane.

1025
01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:02.532
Oh my God.
Are you okay?


1026
01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:05.469
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.


1027
01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:06.637
Did you see that?

1028
01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:07.672
- Did you see it?
- Jane.


1029
01:23:07.705 --> 01:23:08.673
You saw it, right?

1030
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.809
- Jane...
- We have to kill this thing. We have to kill it.


1031
01:23:11.843 --> 01:23:14.411
- It's never going to stop.
- Okay, okay. But...


1032
01:23:14.444 --> 01:23:15.612
We have to kill him.

1033
01:23:15.646 --> 01:23:17.280
But there is
a dead cop down there


1034
01:23:17.314 --> 01:23:18.750
and you are standing
off the ledge


1035
01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:20.517
that she just fell off.

1036
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:22.586
No. No, I didn't do this.

1037
01:23:22.619 --> 01:23:27.257
- She was trying to save me.
- I know. I know. I know.


1038
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:28.225
I believe you.

1039
01:23:28.225 --> 01:23:29.694
I believe you.
I really believe you, okay,


1040
01:23:29.727 --> 01:23:31.863
but the entire LAPD
is about to make its way


1041
01:23:31.896 --> 01:23:33.597
onto this roof, alright?

1042
01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:35.632
We have to go.
We have to go.


1043
01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:38.535
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:23:39.302 --> 01:23:40.537
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:41.739
Here.

1046
01:23:42.707 --> 01:23:44.608
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.


1047
01:23:46.276 --> 01:23:48.445
- Come on.
- Okay.


1048
01:23:48.478 --> 01:23:51.816
Okay. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.


1049
01:24:19.977 --> 01:24:22.479
<i>Um, I know that the
media is saying some</i>


1050
01:24:22.512 --> 01:24:24.414
<i>pretty crazy shit
about me right now,</i>


1051
01:24:24.448 --> 01:24:27.551
<i>but I did not push that woman.</i>

1052
01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:30.520
<i>She was trying to save me.</i>

1053
01:24:30.554 --> 01:24:32.824
<i>And until we got everything
sorted out with the cops,</i>


1054
01:24:32.857 --> 01:24:35.625
<i>I have to go silent for a while,</i>

1055
01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.695
<i>but keep messaging me.</i>

1056
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:39.396
<i>Keep reaching out
to each other.</i>


1057
01:24:39.429 --> 01:24:40.732
<i>Keep sharing your stories.</i>

1058
01:24:40.765 --> 01:24:41.699
<i>Keep posting.</i>

1059
01:24:41.733 --> 01:24:44.001
<i>Keep using the hashtag.</i>

1060
01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:46.470
<i>Let me know
where you are fighting</i>


1061
01:24:47.138 --> 01:24:49.006
<i>and I will come fight with you.</i>

1062
01:24:51.843 --> 01:24:54.544
<i>A manhunt underway
across the south this evening,</i>


1063
01:24:54.578 --> 01:24:57.380
<i>according to police sources,
the well-liked female detective</i>


1064
01:24:57.414 --> 01:24:58.648
<i>fell to her death,</i>

1065
01:24:58.683 --> 01:25:01.418
<i>or should I say,
was pushed to her death</i>


1066
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:04.588
<i>from a fourth floor rooftop
in downtown Los Angeles</i>


1067
01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:05.990
<i>earlier this morning.</i>

1068
01:25:06.023 --> 01:25:09.060
<i>The manhunt has expanded from
Los Angeles to city and county</i>


1069
01:25:09.093 --> 01:25:11.328
<i>to state wide and further.</i>

1070
01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:13.765
<i>Now we go live to a news
conference in progress.</i>


1071
01:25:13.798 --> 01:25:15.398
<i>The last vehicle
that they stole</i>


1072
01:25:15.432 --> 01:25:17.001
<i>did have two hand guns in it.</i>

1073
01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:19.904
<i>And we know that they probably
know they're in there.</i>


1074
01:25:19.937 --> 01:25:22.707
<i>And certainly that raises
the level of alert</i>


1075
01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.641
<i>for any officer
that may encounter them,</i>


1076
01:25:24.675 --> 01:25:26.844
<i>and any civilian
that may approach him either.</i>


1077
01:25:26.878 --> 01:25:28.813
<i>I think we should
remember one thing here.</i>


1078
01:25:28.846 --> 01:25:30.580
<i>There's a difference
between leads</i>


1079
01:25:30.614 --> 01:25:32.750
<i>of what we've been getting
thousands of leads,</i>


1080
01:25:32.784 --> 01:25:34.752
- and a credible sighting.
- And a credible sighting Right.


1081
01:25:34.786 --> 01:25:35.953
<i>Now, we've had credible...</i>

1082
01:25:44.628 --> 01:25:46.563
<i>I just think that you're
being a little nonchalant</i>


1083
01:25:46.596 --> 01:25:48.565
<i>about this whole
on the run thing.</i>


1084
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.002
<i>I have a wig.</i>

1085
01:25:51.035 --> 01:25:52.402
<i>Can you chill?</i>

1086
01:25:52.937 --> 01:25:54.471
You are seriously demented
if you think that


1087
01:25:54.504 --> 01:25:56.373
that wig helps you blend in?

1088
01:25:57.541 --> 01:26:00.745
But this whole thing
is pretty demented.


1089
01:26:00.778 --> 01:26:02.880
We can only do
what we can do, sis.


1090
01:26:02.914 --> 01:26:05.016
We are fucked
six ways to Sunday.


1091
01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:07.584
At least
we're fucked together.


1092
01:26:07.617 --> 01:26:10.453
Oh, I would not agree to that.

1093
01:26:10.487 --> 01:26:12.522
You're so gross.

1094
01:26:12.556 --> 01:26:14.125
- You know what I meant.
- You're disgusting.


1095
01:26:14.158 --> 01:26:16.593
That's disgusting.

1096
01:26:16.626 --> 01:26:19.897
Take it.
Twinkie twins.


1097
01:26:19.931 --> 01:26:21.766
I just brushed my teeth.

1098
01:26:33.643 --> 01:26:37.114
We should probably um,
get a move on pretty soon.


1099
01:26:37.148 --> 01:26:39.016
We're starting to
wear out our welcome.


1100
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:42.452
We can head out
first thing in the morning.


1101
01:26:44.889 --> 01:26:45.957
So...

1102
01:26:47.725 --> 01:26:48.893
where two next?

1103
01:26:49.593 --> 01:26:50.862
Does it matter?

1104
01:26:52.897 --> 01:26:53.764
Mexico.

1105
01:26:53.798 --> 01:26:55.933
Do you know
I've never been to Mexico.


1106
01:27:00.938 --> 01:27:03.573
Do you really think
that thing is still...?


1107
01:27:09.479 --> 01:27:11.115
How long do we have to hide?

1108
01:27:14.651 --> 01:27:16.020
Does it matter?

1109
01:27:21.192 --> 01:27:22.693
Scooch.

1110
01:27:26.529 --> 01:27:27.932
I can't believe
I'm eating this.


1111
01:27:27.965 --> 01:27:29.800
Yes, you can
Adjust the light?


1112
01:27:29.834 --> 01:27:30.835
Yeah.

1113
01:27:36.473 --> 01:27:38.709
I think they're good for you,
if you only eat one.


1114
01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:41.879
I think they use
real cane sugar in these.


1115
01:27:41.913 --> 01:27:43.114
Yeah, right?

01:27:57.091 --> 01:28:02.091
