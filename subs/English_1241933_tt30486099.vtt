00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:51.763
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful here.


3
00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.765
Isn't it exciting?

4
00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:56.266
[Ester] This place is amazing.

5
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.603
If you are impressed
how it looks now,


6
00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.906
you should have seen it
when I was a child.


7
00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.076
<i>One side of the square</i>

8
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.146
<i>and the other,</i>
<i>the Slovak market.</i>


9
00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.081
[man] Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:17.655
[Emil] <i>There was</i>
<i>a friendship between the two</i>


12
00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.557

15
00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.801
This is my heder

16
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.303
where I learned the Bible.

17
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:10.875
And this
is my grandfather's house


18
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.409
where he lived.

19
00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:15.413
I'm making a <i>neder.</i>

20
00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:17.281
-[woman] Do you think that--
-What's a <i>neder?</i>


21
00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:19.717
A <i>neder</i> is a promise to the Jews

22
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.986
that they'll never be forgotten

23
00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.388
and their history
and their behavior


24
00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:27.559
and their example
will live forever.


25
00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:32.697
What happened to them?

26
00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:43.441
[Stefan] All the Jews, wake up!

27
00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:46.209
All the Jews need
to register for work.


28
00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:49.212
Young and old.

29
00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:52.082
Who does not want...

30
00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:54.419
will be punished.

31
00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.889
[Emil] <i>They were not Nazis.</i>

32
00:02:58.022 --> 00:02:59.857
<i>They were Hlinka Guards,</i>

00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:02.694
<i>Slovakian State Police.</i>

34
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:06.898
Make sure to get
all the alleyways this time,


35
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.266
not just the main square.

36
00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:11.536
The whole Jewish quarter?

37
00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:13.370
Yes.

38
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.408
Every Jew, that's what it says.

39
00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:20.678
So everyone
can see it and read it.


40
00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:24.281
[Emil] <i>They had to make sure</i>
<i>that every Jew in Bardejov</i>


41
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:26.517

42
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.553
[Mrs. Schondof]
Thomas, is that you?


43
00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.822
Good morning, Mrs. Schondof.

44
00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:32.490
-Hi, Thomas.
-Hi.


45
00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:34.224
[Emil] <i>It was mostly</i>
<i>friends and neighbors</i>


46
00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:35.325
<i>who brought them the news.</i>

47
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.561
Why so early?

48
00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:38.663
Oh, I'm so sorry for waking you.

49
00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.031
It's not my doing.

50
00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:43.901
Oh, hi, Helena.
See you at football later.


51
00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:46.403
Yeah. See you.

52
00:03:56.014 --> 00:03:57.682
Lowy, the Jew.

53
00:03:58.382 --> 00:04:00.183
[Emil] <i>Refuel Lowy was the head</i>

55
00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:05.155
<i>He was a successful businessman</i>

56
00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:06.824
<i>and a winemaker.</i>

57
00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.894
<i>Those who knew him,</i>
<i>respected him.</i>


58
00:04:10.028 --> 00:04:12.497
<i>And those who didn't,</i>
<i>feared him.</i>


59
00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:16.233
You couldn't wait
'til a decent hour?


60
00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:22.907
Yes,

61

[indistinct] into
the General Council at night.


62
00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.280
You'll be hearing from us.

63
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:35.252
Oh, please,

64
00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:37.855
and pay your drivers
better next time.


65
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.562
Maybe it's not a good time...

66
00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:47.832
to bark orders, Mr. Lowy.

Refuel.

74
00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:26.704
-We were so worried.
-I'm fine.


75
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.040
The meeting went 'til 3:00 a.m.

76
00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.341
and then by the time
[indistinct] from Bratislava.


77
00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:33.343
You must be exhausted.

[Lowy groans]

79
00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:37.380
I need to [indistinct]
and call the meeting.


80
00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:40.084
Where are the boys?

81
00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:42.053
They're upstairs getting ready.

82
00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:43.788
Tell them to meet me at shul.

83

-Do we need to register?
-No.


84
00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:52.930
We have a-- a yellow card. Yes.

80 exempt families
are at the essentials.


86

Okay? It's all right.

87
00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.537
Just a bit more complicated.

88
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.706
The boys are scared, Refuel.

89
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.343
There's too much happening
too quickly.

-I am.

We are.

I'm too vital for them.
Do you understand?

I heard they've made
a deal with the Germans.

Of course they have.

That's why the Germans

They need us all to work

that's why
they closed the schools.

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.873
Passion should keep him safe.

166
00:12:10.007 --> 00:12:12.209
-We need him.
-I will see you upstairs.


167
00:12:12.343 --> 00:12:14.078
-I'll bring the [indistinct].
-Yes.


168
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:16.914
And the others, we need
the whole Jewish Council.


169
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.417
And-- and coffee.

170
00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:22.386
Please tell my son,
[indistinct], to fetch me one.


171
00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:23.854
I haven't slept.

172
00:12:34.798 --> 00:12:36.066
Thank you, Ben.

173
00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:45.242
Halberstam,
with your permission.


174
00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:47.044
-Sure.
-Sure.


175
00:12:49.713 --> 00:12:51.782
Clearly I couldn't
stop the order.


176
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.153
Now we handed a letter
to give to President Tiso


177
00:12:56.287 --> 00:12:59.256
requesting assurance
that the work will stay local


178
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.026
and that, uh,
protect the Slovakian Jews


179
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.894
from German deportations.

180
00:13:04.695 --> 00:13:06.964
-Assurance?
-What kind of assurance?


181
00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:09.534
Clearly we don't believe
their promises, all right?


182
00:13:09.668 --> 00:13:12.002
They're trying to make good
for the independence


183
00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:14.639
and they have to give
Hitler what he-- what he wants.


184
00:13:14.772 --> 00:13:15.806
They need us.

185
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:18.175
The sheer numbers
of the economic force


186
00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:20.545
of the Slovakian Jews is
something to show the Germans.


187
00:13:20.945 --> 00:13:23.013
-Foolish to deport us.
-[Mayer] Absolutely.


188
00:13:23.147 --> 00:13:25.483
Yeah, but we also
received a telegram from, uh,


189
00:13:25.617 --> 00:13:28.420
the German other secretary,
uh, Martin, uh--


190
00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:30.154
-Martin Luther?
-Yes.


191
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:33.257
They're requesting

192
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.326
to work in the East.

193
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.762
Now they're registering us.

194
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.066
-That's just the beginning.
-It's just for show.


195
00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:46.504
20,000, 90,000
Jews in all of Slovakia.


196
00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:49.106
And Tiso is going to pay...

197
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.943
20,000 German marks per Jew

198
00:13:53.077 --> 00:13:55.045
to Hitler for the privilege.

199
00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:58.182
Ah, so we are making the money

200
00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:01.185
to pay for our own deportation.

201
00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.623
What's the plan?
Who's getting deported?


202
00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.190
Those who can walk, I suppose.

203
00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:09.260
I don't think
they have a plan right now.


204
00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:12.129
But it's important that we keep

205
00:14:12.263 --> 00:14:15.165
playing the game
for the time being.


206
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:18.335
But it's important
to put a message out there.


207
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.037
People need to register.

208
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.007
We have to go through
these motions here.


209
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.110
There are 450 families
in Bardejov.


210
00:14:27.545 --> 00:14:30.080
4600 people.

211
00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:31.650
Listen,

212
00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:33.951
purim is [indistinct] Shaboss.

213
00:14:34.084 --> 00:14:36.421
All right, let's keep
things normal, Rabbi.


214
00:14:36.554 --> 00:14:40.492
We need to make everything
just like <i>pur.</i>


215
00:14:41.292 --> 00:14:43.927
Turn it on its head,
God willing.


216
00:14:44.061 --> 00:14:45.329
[Rabbi speaking
other language]


217
00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:47.097
Amen.

218
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:48.700
[Rabbi speaking
other language]


219
00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:51.302
Thursday is Taanit Esther.

220
00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:54.706
Two and a half
thousand years ago,


221
00:14:54.838 --> 00:14:56.807
she demanded a fast.

222
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.678
We listened and we were saved.

223
00:15:00.377 --> 00:15:04.582
Make sure everyone
is fasting this time as well.


224
00:15:04.716 --> 00:15:06.317
It's-- it's important.

225
00:15:07.351 --> 00:15:09.587
Also, please...

226
00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:13.324
make sure that you have
a plan for your families.


227
00:15:13.924 --> 00:15:15.326
You understand?

228
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:20.230
What about all the Polish Jews
that have come flooding in?


229
00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:22.232
Yeah, that's a--
that's a good point.


230
00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:23.967
Mayer,

231
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:26.236
try to tell Helena
to stop for right now.


232
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.372
All right?
Your daughter will understand.


233
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:33.277
I-- I-- I don't know
how we can do anything.


234
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.978
Well, she's a very
clever girl, all right?


235
00:15:35.112 --> 00:15:37.114
She's arranged
for hundreds of them.


236
00:15:37.981 --> 00:15:39.451
She can figure out a way.

237
00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:43.120
It makes sense to think
Slovakia is different.


238
00:15:43.253 --> 00:15:46.624
Safer, but we cannot
take the risk anymore.


239
00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:49.226
[Mayer] What risk is it
to us to help them?


240
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.464
[Lowy] How about overcrowding,
rations, typhus.


241
00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:54.298
Our leverage
is in our workforce.


242
00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.934
We need to remain
healthy, productive.


243
00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:58.436
This will protect us.

244
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.772
[Mayer] We cannot
turn Jews away.


245
00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:02.440
[Lowy] I understand that,

246
00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:06.043
but we have to comply
with the order to buy more time.


247
00:16:06.578 --> 00:16:07.779
Curfew at seven.

248
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:09.748
No doing business with Aryans.

249
00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:12.584
No walking on
the same side of the street.


250
00:16:13.016 --> 00:16:16.387
It's important
that we be very smart.


251
00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:18.790
We be close to our families,

252
00:16:18.922 --> 00:16:22.960
close to each other
and make sure that we understand


253
00:16:23.093 --> 00:16:25.864
that we are living
in very dangerous times.


254
00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:29.868
We-- we just
put our trust in God


255
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.902
and pray for the best.

256
00:16:32.035 --> 00:16:34.371
We-- we have to believe...

257
00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:36.474
he will save us.

258
00:16:40.177 --> 00:16:43.782
Friends, it's important
that you register.


259
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.551
Each family head
must register his family.


260
00:16:46.684 --> 00:16:49.454
We have to keep to the codex.
We have to be under the radar.


261
00:16:49.587 --> 00:16:51.989
Do what they ask us
to do so we can...


262
00:16:52.824 --> 00:16:54.191
work things out, please.

263
00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:57.327
It's better
we cooperate and keep calm.


264
00:16:59.062 --> 00:17:00.598
Hashem will keep us safe.

265
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.036
Go upstairs.
Get your toys there.


266
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.572
We'll go eat soon. Okay?

267
00:17:09.306 --> 00:17:10.274
-Hi.
-Hi.


268
00:17:10.407 --> 00:17:11.843
I'm going to lie down.

269
00:17:11.975 --> 00:17:14.111
I know. I know, Refuel.
But two minutes.


270
00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:16.046
[sighs] Roza, please.

271
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.715
I promise we'll <i>schmues</i> later.

272
00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.184
I know, I know, but not me.

273
00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.153
-I promised them.
-Huh?


274
00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:28.258
[sighs] Really?

275
00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:30.895
They're your uncle's cousins,
your family.


276
00:17:31.028 --> 00:17:32.597
[Lowy groans]

277
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:35.567
Yes. All Jews are family.

278
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.234
Things are not
better here anymore.


279
00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:38.736
Things are much better here.

280
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.338
Refuel, listen to what
they have to say.


281
00:17:41.906 --> 00:17:43.541
-Only two.
-Only two.


282
00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:56.454
-We have the room.
-We have the room.


283
00:17:57.354 --> 00:17:59.156
We have nothing but room.

284
00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:03.561
[laughs] Okay. All right.

285
00:18:10.502 --> 00:18:13.036
-[indistinct].
-They have our address, Helena.


286
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.105
Did you plaster our address

287
00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.241
on every ghetto in Poland?

288
00:18:17.374 --> 00:18:20.110
Helena, we need
to stop them coming.


289
00:18:20.244 --> 00:18:23.113
-It's not helping--
-I cannot, Daddy.


290
00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:25.884
We have a good system.

291
00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:27.284
We're better off than they are.

292
00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:29.186
They know that.
And you know that.


293
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:33.190
Mr. Lowy says
that we're already too crowded


294
00:18:33.323 --> 00:18:35.225
and they bring typhus.

295
00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:36.661
Let's see him turn them away.

296
00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:40.130
Darling, I'm not sure Bardejov

297
00:18:40.264 --> 00:18:42.934
is as protected
as they think it is.


298
00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:45.335
As you think it is.

299
00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:49.807
[Emil] <i>Jewish businesses</i>
<i>were handed over to non-Jews.</i>


300
00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:51.976
<i>They were known as</i> [indistinct]

301
00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:55.647
<i>put in place to control</i>
<i>the Jewish businesses.</i>


302
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.416
<i>Fredrik</i>
<i>was Lowy's</i> [indistinct],


303
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.919
<i>but also his friend.</i>

304
00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:03.253
You should have signed them,
Herr Director.


305
00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:05.023
You are the boss now, Fredrik.

306
00:19:05.155 --> 00:19:06.558
It seems absurd.

307
00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:08.526
Yeah, it is.

308
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.429
Herr Director, you and your
family are sorted, yeah?


309
00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:15.098
I can't do anything
for any of these people.


310
00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:17.301
But for you
and Roza and the boys.


311
00:19:17.435 --> 00:19:19.269
We are good.
It's very kind, Fredrik.


312
00:19:19.403 --> 00:19:21.573
I-- We have the--
the yellow card.


313
00:19:21.706 --> 00:19:24.341
All right,
so we exempt at least--


314
00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:26.010
at least from this one.

315
00:19:26.844 --> 00:19:29.814
And Lowy,
you know if you ever need...


316
00:19:30.715 --> 00:19:32.850
I have a place for you
just outside these walls.


317
00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:34.485
It's my father's place.

318
00:19:35.787 --> 00:19:37.855
They've asked us
to take your passports.


319
00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:39.524
[sighs] Yes.

320
00:19:40.525 --> 00:19:43.661
First, all rights then property.

321
00:19:43.795 --> 00:19:45.964
[laughs] And now papers.

322
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:48.265
Well, we're losing us to dogs.

323
00:19:48.398 --> 00:19:50.635
It's still better
than having the Germans here.


324
00:19:50.768 --> 00:19:53.671
Well, it's only because
you all so incompetent.


325
00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:55.105
[Lowy laughs]

326
00:19:55.573 --> 00:19:58.175
Besides, we have, uh,
bigger jobs to do right now.


327
00:19:58.308 --> 00:19:59.944
Purim.

328
00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:03.146
There we go, you know, Fredrik,
you could pass as a Jew.


329
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.084
Yes, purim.
Not tomorrow. The next day.


330
00:20:06.884 --> 00:20:09.954
And everyone is getting
whatever wine they want


331
00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:11.355
for whatever they can give.

332
00:20:11.489 --> 00:20:12.957
And this is an order.
You understand?


333
00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:14.525
You're asking me to take a loss.

334
00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:16.594
Well, don't worry.
You'll make it up somehow.


335
00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:19.998
I want to thank you
for recruiting Adam.


336
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:22.600
He brought us
some very important information


337
00:20:22.734 --> 00:20:23.801
this morning.

338
00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:29.474
This is a sanctuary
more than a factory.


339
00:20:29.607 --> 00:20:31.141
Mm.

340
00:20:31.943 --> 00:20:33.811
Make sure today and tomorrow

341
00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:37.280
everyone has a chance to go
to the main square and register.


342
00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:38.950
-Yes.
-Stagger the groups.


343
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:40.350
Okay? Keep them busy.

344
00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:42.587
Yes. Yes. I-
- I saw the notice.

345
00:20:45.723 --> 00:20:47.725
I wish this was
just a formality.

Oh.

349
00:21:04.207 --> 00:21:07.011
We don't know what they want
from all those Jews here.


350
00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:10.014
Work, they're following orders
like good little Jews.


351

They already work for us.
We own all their bloody stores.

[Pieter]
I hear Tiso asked Himmler


353
00:21:14.619 --> 00:21:15.987
to take the whole lot of them.

354
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.755
All 90,000 Jews in Slovakia.

355
00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:19.457
[Slav]
Himmler wanted the Jews out.


356
00:21:20.024 --> 00:21:22.894
Tiso asked him
to have them never return.


357
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:25.763
You know what that means?

358
00:21:25.897 --> 00:21:27.197
That's why
they registering them.


359
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.900
We are paying the Germans?

360
00:21:30.668 --> 00:21:31.936
20,000.

361
00:21:33.303 --> 00:21:36.040
-20,000 what?
-20,000.


362
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:39.010
The order is for 20,000.

363
00:21:39.143 --> 00:21:41.344
20,000 for what?

364

366
00:21:46.818 --> 00:21:48.820
But we don't have
more than 4,000 here.


367
00:21:48.953 --> 00:21:49.987
Yeah.

368

Not all of them, you moron.

369

20,000 total.

-For what?
-For work.

You mean for death?

372
00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:01.298
What the German do with Jews,
it's not our problem.


373
00:22:02.232 --> 00:22:03.968
Our problem is Kovac

and these bastards
who treat us like dogs.

-But not us.

No.

We can do the job ourselves.

We call a curfew tomorrow

Lowy, use this.
As much as you need.

00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:56.821
Tell my wife I'm safe.
I'll be back in the morning.

I'm not here for you, Mr. Lowy.

00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:16.568
I have business
with Captain Reisteiter.

If this keeps, I can no longer
promise calm and cooperation.

Our debts are clear now.

503
00:29:22.173 --> 00:29:25.843
Do your job Mr. Lowy
and stay clear.

-Stefan!

-Yes, it is.
-No.


507

Let him think he was a big hero.

508
00:30:07.552 --> 00:30:09.787
I was going to have
a problem here regardless.


509
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.323
It's them Jews,
think they can do--


510
00:30:12.457 --> 00:30:13.891
Think, yes.

511
00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:16.595
Let them think
whatever they want, it's good.


512
00:30:17.094 --> 00:30:18.929
You and your men, [indistinct],

513
00:30:19.063 --> 00:30:20.864
we need the Jews compliant...

515
00:30:23.867 --> 00:30:26.036
Could it be that
your [indistinct]


516
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.738
will work to our advantage.

517
00:30:28.272 --> 00:30:30.774
They'll think they've won.

518
00:30:30.908 --> 00:30:32.876
They'll think they're protected.

519
00:30:34.646 --> 00:30:37.281
We have plans
in place for all Slovakia.


520
00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:40.017
We'll be moving them
by the thousands

522

I need to save face here.

-My men.
-Don't worry.

Just follow the plan.

That's what this pin means.

526
00:30:53.465 --> 00:30:55.032
Sir,

527
00:30:55.165 --> 00:30:58.235
there is a--
a boy with a high fever.


528
00:30:58.802 --> 00:31:00.170
Looks like typhus.

529
00:31:00.304 --> 00:31:01.839
For God's sake!

530
00:31:03.073 --> 00:31:05.543
Get everyone away.
Leave him for the Jews.


531
00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:06.745
Yes, sir.

532
00:31:07.111 --> 00:31:10.080
You get your Jew
to get a doctor here


533
00:31:10.214 --> 00:31:12.383
and quarantine them under guard.

534
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:15.654
If this spreads,

535
00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.489
it'll be your head
they come for.

You used to have
an appetite, remember?

Hmm.

I'm not hungry.

Mrs. Lowy. Refuel.

00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:23.954
Boy, typhus.

548
00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:28.125
One boy?

549
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:29.893
So far.

550
00:32:30.027 --> 00:32:31.463
All right, isolate the boy

551
00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:33.665
and then make sure
that the family quarantine


552
00:32:33.798 --> 00:32:35.032
during Shabbos.

553

We'll come to see him soon.

554
00:32:37.101 --> 00:32:39.637
Okay. Good Shabbos, Mrs. Lowy.

555
00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:46.544
All we need now
is a typhus outbreak.


556

The Rabbi is speaking.

559
00:32:57.622 --> 00:33:00.425
The evil Haman
sought to destroy us all.


560
00:33:00.991 --> 00:33:02.660
The plan was in place.

561
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:05.996
And who did he start with?

562
00:33:08.533 --> 00:33:10.300
Also the children.

563
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:12.269
Now...

564
00:33:13.103 --> 00:33:17.174
now we have
and new Haman just as evil.


565
00:33:18.643 --> 00:33:21.044
We all have to fast...

566

The rumors from Poland
are terrifying, true.

But today, here in Bardejov...

572
00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:42.700
we have our most powerful
weapons in place.


573
00:33:43.535 --> 00:33:47.605
Faith that the Almighty
will redeem his people.


574
00:33:48.205 --> 00:33:51.676
Faith that ultimately
the wicked are punished


575
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.977
and the righteous prosper.

576

But joy in being a Jew.

00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:40.458
There.

[doorbell dinging]

00:50:22.801 --> 00:50:24.301
I-- uh,

814
00:50:24.436 --> 00:50:26.671
I'm picking up a prescription

815
00:50:26.805 --> 00:50:28.138
for Hershe.

816
00:50:39.016 --> 00:50:40.552
I told you he'd show up.

817
00:50:40.984 --> 00:50:42.286
Glad you were expecting me.

818
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.656
That means
you know what's going on.


819
00:50:44.955 --> 00:50:46.658
Tell me what you know.

820
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:49.960
We know the Hlinka Guard, uh,
are involved in the roundups.


821
00:50:50.929 --> 00:50:53.565
Poprad is a local
transit center.


822
00:50:53.698 --> 00:50:55.700
At least 1000 people...

823
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:59.036
girls in the next two days.

824
00:50:59.771 --> 00:51:03.641
Is there a--
a shoe factory in Brezovec?


825
00:51:07.411 --> 00:51:10.280
There is no
shoe factory in Brezovec.


826
00:51:14.184 --> 00:51:15.986
Where are the trains going?

Tell us they're okay.

855
00:53:13.538 --> 00:53:14.806
You found the factory?

856
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:18.977
Auschwitz.

857
00:53:19.444 --> 00:53:21.278
-Auschwitz?
-[Rabbi] Auschwitz?


858
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:23.313
-[Mayer] Auschwitz?
-Auschwitz?


859
00:53:23.448 --> 00:53:26.417
A camp called Auschwitz.
Prisoner camp.


860
00:53:29.454 --> 00:53:31.589
The prisoners
are making shoes now?


861
00:53:33.323 --> 00:53:34.592
[Lowy chuckles]

862
00:53:35.927 --> 00:53:37.729
It's not a shoe factory.

863
00:53:38.963 --> 00:53:40.431
[Erwin] What is it then?

864
00:53:43.868 --> 00:53:46.037
Executions. Gassings.

865
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:48.238
-[Erwin sighs]
-It's a death camp.


866
00:53:54.378 --> 00:53:55.880
They have already killed...

867
00:53:56.848 --> 00:53:57.982
hundreds of Russians.

868
00:53:58.416 --> 00:54:01.284
-Jews?
-No, not yet.


869
00:54:02.954 --> 00:54:05.188
But they're building a new camp.

870
00:54:05.322 --> 00:54:07.224
A massive new camp...

871
00:54:07.959 --> 00:54:09.226
for us.

872
00:54:12.362 --> 00:54:14.899
Our girls are not
coming back from there.


873
00:54:15.033 --> 00:54:16.901
Not just our girls.

874
00:54:17.869 --> 00:54:18.936
Thousands...

875
00:54:21.171 --> 00:54:23.141
of Jewish girls
from all over Slovakia.


876
00:54:23.273 --> 00:54:25.677
[sighs] We cannot let them go.

877
00:54:26.811 --> 00:54:29.947
-Let's storm the school.
-Have you seen how many guards?


878
00:54:30.081 --> 00:54:33.551
-It's suicide if we do that.
-Let's call the partisans.


879
00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:34.886
My Helena.

880
00:54:38.255 --> 00:54:39.791
They are still right here.

881
00:54:39.924 --> 00:54:41.559
We have to do something.

882
00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.463
Lowy, what are you thinking?

883
00:54:46.597 --> 00:54:48.966
Soviet war, [indistinct],

884
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.536
mass murder, gas chambers.

885
00:54:52.302 --> 00:54:54.337
All true.

886
00:54:54.472 --> 00:54:57.442
Now Auschwitz, now our girls...

887
00:54:58.341 --> 00:55:00.210
and we're going to be next.

888
00:55:00.343 --> 00:55:02.279
We'll follow them
to the slaughter.


889
00:55:03.147 --> 00:55:04.415
Faster! Go!

890
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:06.050
[Lowy]
The fate of Slovakian Jewry


891
00:55:06.184 --> 00:55:07.785
is written on the wall.

892
00:55:08.453 --> 00:55:09.554
[all crying]

893
00:55:09.687 --> 00:55:11.756
But wishing it was different...

894
00:55:11.889 --> 00:55:13.223
Sit down. Fast!

895
00:55:13.356 --> 00:55:14.425
[Lowy] ...won't change.

896
00:55:15.193 --> 00:55:19.396
Thousands of girls were stolen
from their homes tonight.


897
00:55:20.397 --> 00:55:22.166
And how many more to follow?

898
00:55:22.834 --> 00:55:25.670
We need to send
the world a message.


899
00:55:27.972 --> 00:55:29.674
What you're suggesting?

900
00:55:30.775 --> 00:55:34.746
I have enough gasoline
and gunpowder in my warehouse...


901
00:55:35.613 --> 00:55:37.982
to blow the whole
of Bardejov sky high...


902
00:55:39.417 --> 00:55:41.686
Bardejov burn to the ground

903
00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:43.855
by its people, by the Jews.

904
00:55:44.254 --> 00:55:46.424
And the Germans
will then understand


905
00:55:46.557 --> 00:55:48.760
that they cannot
take us and leave.


906
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:52.329
Many people will die.

907
00:55:53.396 --> 00:55:55.032
Many Jews will die.

908
00:55:55.433 --> 00:55:56.768
I know.

909
00:55:57.135 --> 00:55:59.470
They take our daughters...

910
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:02.405
and-- and we kill theirs?

911
00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.076
We save our daughters
and who knows how many.


912
00:56:06.244 --> 00:56:09.614
There will be no train
leaving from Bardejov tomorrow.


913
00:56:10.548 --> 00:56:12.717
There will be no Bardejov.

914
00:56:13.417 --> 00:56:14.752
Where we will go?

915
00:56:15.352 --> 00:56:17.088
We'll all be shot within hours.

916
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:18.956
Killed like animals.

917
00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:20.191
By-- by whom?

918
00:56:20.625 --> 00:56:23.360
They will be running
for their lives, too.


919
00:56:25.563 --> 00:56:26.831
Uh, Lowy...

920
00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:29.600
I cannot allow it.

921
00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:33.538
The only question is, what...

922
00:56:34.472 --> 00:56:36.440
does God say?

923
00:56:37.642 --> 00:56:41.612
In here,
I don't think He says yes.


924
00:56:47.752 --> 00:56:50.488
[Lowy] Here.
Come here. [indistinct]


925
00:56:55.126 --> 00:56:56.494
[Adam exhales sharply]

926
00:56:56.627 --> 00:57:00.164
Good evening,
Mr. Bear and Mr. Rabbit.


927
00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:02.900
[laughs]
You have a carrot for me?


928
00:57:03.034 --> 00:57:06.504
[laughs] I'm just joking.
Give me a cigarette.


929
00:57:06.637 --> 00:57:09.406
-I'm scared.
-Be brave.


930
00:57:11.876 --> 00:57:14.045
Listen, guys,
I have something for you.


931
00:57:15.847 --> 00:57:16.981
Pure gold.

932
00:57:17.615 --> 00:57:19.951
Follow me. Follow me.

933
00:57:23.087 --> 00:57:25.489
You could buy
something for your wife,


934
00:57:25.623 --> 00:57:28.092
your second wife. [laughs]

935
00:57:30.528 --> 00:57:32.096
Here, take the watch.

936
00:57:32.697 --> 00:57:36.500
And for you, Mr. Rabbit,
you can take it all.


937
00:57:37.168 --> 00:57:38.401
That's for you.

938
00:57:41.072 --> 00:57:44.308
Ah, you saw
the football game yesterday.


939
00:57:44.442 --> 00:57:46.409
[laughs] They got them Germans.

940
00:57:46.544 --> 00:57:48.378
They know how to play.
Huh? [chuckles]


941
00:57:48.512 --> 00:57:49.747
[breathing heavily]

942
00:57:49.881 --> 00:57:51.482
It's all right. 
It's all right.

943
00:57:51.616 --> 00:57:53.050
It's going to be okay.

944
00:57:53.751 --> 00:57:55.887
It's okay. It's okay.

945
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.121
Here.

946
00:57:58.356 --> 00:57:59.557
She must come with me!

947
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.359
It's all right.
What's the matter?


948
00:58:01.492 --> 00:58:03.594
She's sick. She must be removed.

949
00:58:03.728 --> 00:58:05.263
She's just scared.
Leave her alone.


950
00:58:05.395 --> 00:58:07.999
-It's all right.
-[panting] Mommy.


951
00:58:08.132 --> 00:58:09.467
She has typhus.

952
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.702
-She cannot stay.
-She's just scared.


953
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.272
Leave us. I'll bring her to you.

954
00:58:14.404 --> 00:58:16.406
[breathing heavily]

955
00:58:17.608 --> 00:58:19.610
-[whimpering]
-Everything will be okay.


956
00:58:19.744 --> 00:58:21.312
At least she will go home.

957
00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:24.015
[tense music playing]

958
00:58:26.317 --> 00:58:27.752
Okay. I'm sorry.

959
00:58:27.885 --> 00:58:29.787
Thank you. God bless you.

960
00:58:34.592 --> 00:58:36.527
-[Giselle] Shh.
-[breathing heavily]


961
00:58:37.995 --> 00:58:40.131
[indistinct]

962
00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:42.934
-Give it to me.
-Thank you.


963
00:58:44.001 --> 00:58:46.137
Take that to him. 
Do it quickly.

964
00:58:46.737 --> 00:58:49.740
[whimpering]

965
00:58:53.144 --> 00:58:55.079
Adam. Adam.

966
00:58:59.383 --> 00:59:01.285
-Take this.
-What is it?


967
00:59:01.886 --> 00:59:03.154
Just-- just take it.

968
00:59:04.088 --> 00:59:05.189
Thank you.

969
00:59:28.012 --> 00:59:29.080
[Lowy] Come.

970
00:59:29.914 --> 00:59:32.417
There's no way out.
It's sealed shut.


971
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.752

972
00:59:34.885 --> 00:59:36.587
They're [indistinct]
the extra troops.


973
00:59:36.721 --> 00:59:39.390
You will never be able
to take 300 girls.


974
00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:43.127
If you have someone here
that know how to speak with God,


975
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.729
now it's the time.

976
00:59:47.365 --> 00:59:48.632
From the girls.

977
00:59:55.573 --> 00:59:58.242
[tense music playing]

978
01:00:01.212 --> 01:00:02.813
Is there a way in?

979
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.682
I don't know. I...

980
01:00:06.217 --> 01:00:07.718
I suppose.

981
01:00:10.054 --> 01:00:11.922
[Erwin] What are you
going to do, Mr. Lowy?


982
01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:15.292
-Blow it up?
-[Lowy laughs]


983
01:00:20.898 --> 01:00:22.434
Besides the Jews...

984
01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:26.404
what is the one thing
the Germans are most afraid of?


985
01:00:26.537 --> 01:00:28.139
There are no Germans here, Lowy.

986
01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:30.174
Yes, yes there are.

987
01:00:31.575 --> 01:00:33.377
Auschwitz is theirs.

988
01:00:33.512 --> 01:00:34.979
This is their plan.

989
01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:37.548
Hlinka Guards
are their errand boys.


990
01:00:37.681 --> 01:00:38.983
They're here.

991
01:00:39.984 --> 01:00:41.919
And what are
they most afraid of?


992
01:00:42.053 --> 01:00:44.423
-The Russians?
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


993
01:00:44.889 --> 01:00:46.991
What kills their plans?

994
01:00:47.124 --> 01:00:48.759
Puts a wrench
in their whole machine?


995
01:00:48.893 --> 01:00:50.795
-Kills production?
-Enough!


996
01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:52.329
What?

997
01:00:53.498 --> 01:00:54.965
Typhus.

998
01:00:57.601 --> 01:00:59.637
-It's brilliant.
-[Lowy laughs]


999
01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:02.773
If we can get
enough serum for the girls,


1000
01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:04.275
if we can get in...

1001
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:08.779
it'll create an epidemic.

1002
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.382
How much do we need?

1003
01:01:11.516 --> 01:01:14.919
A double dose of serum
will bring out symptoms.


1004
01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:16.521
That should be enough.

1005
01:01:16.654 --> 01:01:19.156
It will declare
Bardejov of infected.


1006
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.560
Seal us off
and force a quarantine.


1007
01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:22.927
Who has the authority?

1008
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.796
Dr. Milos Baratis
in [indistinct]


1009
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.365
is a district head medic.

1010
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.868
So how many people
need to show symptoms?


1011
01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:32.903
Five won't stop the trains.

1012
01:01:34.238 --> 01:01:35.372
10-15...

1013
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.274
should do it.

1014
01:01:37.408 --> 01:01:39.643
How dangerous is a double dose?

1015
01:01:44.982 --> 01:01:47.251
-There is a risk.
-A real risk.


1016
01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:50.721
An outbreak, maybe worse.

1017
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:53.324
But there are guards everywhere.

1018
01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.626
How will we even get inside?

1019
01:01:55.759 --> 01:01:57.895
-Boris.
-The plumber?


1020
01:01:58.829 --> 01:02:00.664
He has access to the sewers.

1021
01:02:01.132 --> 01:02:02.766
They run directly
beneath the school.


1022
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.335
Forget about how we get in.

1023
01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:07.104
H-- how can we get
enough serum this quickly?


1024
01:02:07.238 --> 01:02:08.305
Kosice.

1025
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:10.609
In Kosice.

1026
01:02:10.741 --> 01:02:12.710
It's a two hour drive.

1027
01:02:13.344 --> 01:02:16.814
And they're not exactly
waiting for us either.


1028
01:02:16.947 --> 01:02:18.782
You-- you won't be back
till midnight.


1029
01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:21.018
Who says it's enough time

1030
01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:23.287
for the serum to take effect?

1031
01:02:23.421 --> 01:02:26.123
Dr. Baratis will need
to declare an epidemic


1032
01:02:26.257 --> 01:02:28.092
and this will
stop the transport.


1033
01:02:28.225 --> 01:02:31.362
And we need to have early
enough to show these symptoms.


1034
01:02:31.496 --> 01:02:33.898
Can we really do this?

1035
01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:36.700
Bomba, can you get us in?

1036
01:02:37.234 --> 01:02:38.936
I'm not sure. Maybe one of you.

1037
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:41.238
No. Has to be two.

1038
01:02:41.805 --> 01:02:43.073
Two of us.

1039
01:02:44.576 --> 01:02:45.843
This is...

1040
01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:47.778
this is our plan.

1041
01:02:48.245 --> 01:02:50.314
Okay? There's nothing else.

1042
01:02:52.183 --> 01:02:55.853
If anyone has any objection,
please speak now.


1043
01:02:59.356 --> 01:03:01.892
Josef, you have
to go to Kosice now.


1044
01:03:02.026 --> 01:03:04.128
Hurry up.
Get enough serum for the girls.


1045
01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:06.464
You're going to administer it.
I'll meet you there.


1046
01:03:06.598 --> 01:03:08.766
Bomba, go get Boris.

1047
01:03:08.899 --> 01:03:10.502
If there is a way
into the sewer,


1048
01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:12.102
we need to know for certain.

1049
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:15.072
I will get
the outbreak declaration set up.


1050
01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:17.908
I will meet my people in Zborov.

1051
01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:21.812
We meet at the brewery at 12:30.

1052
01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:24.014
All right.
Now go home to your families.

1054

And may God help us.

I thought I'd come to see

what the Jews
would be doing now...

with something.

Don't you think?

1067

I'm not sure
what you want me to say.

Please tell me.

I'm not like you, Stefan.

1077

Yes. Yes, they are.
