00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.448
Laras? It's time to wake up!

2
00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:04.865
I'm up already, Mom!

3
00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:10.865
"Their faces are moving closer..."

4
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.531
"Their lips are almost touching..."

5
00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:22.906
Laras, time to take a shower!

6
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.156
- Laras! come on!
- In a minute, Mom!

#27 DAVID'S DAISY
#26 FROM JAKARTA FOR LIVERPOOL


9
00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:37.990
<i>For all Your blessings</i>

10
00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:42.906
<i>Thank you, Jesus</i>

11
00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:46.531
<i>Our praises just for You</i>

12
00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.656
Mom, add some sausages, please?

13
00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:57.490
Have you been staying up late?

14
00:03:57.573 --> 00:03:59.615
Your face is breaking out.

15
00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:04.448
Do you wash your face before bed?

16
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:05.531
Of course I do.

17
00:04:05.573 --> 00:04:08.490
Ask your sister
what facial wash she's using.


18
00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:11.948
She's been up with the baby,
but her face is cleaner now.


19
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:13.281
She's pretty again.

20
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.448
No one told her to get pregnant.

21
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.948
She stays up late
because she has too many kids.


22
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.031
I'm staying up late
to get into the UI.

23
00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:21.531
You never listen.

24
00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.240
You can study hard. 
Just don't overdo it.

25
00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:28.281
Have a little fun. You're still young.

26
00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:30.490
Go hang out with Dilla again.

27
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.615
Are you still not speaking?

28
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.792
THE WINNER FOR HIGH SCHOOL SHORT WRITING
COMPETITION 2022, DKI JAKARTA


29
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.990
Leaving for school, miss?

30
00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:31.948
Yeah.

31
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:34.031
Hold on, miss.

32
00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:40.198
Ride carefully.

33
00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:05.198
Yes! Come on!

34
00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:06.281
Take it!

35
00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.115
Come on, bro!

36
00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:09.865
David! Come on!

37
00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:11.240
Yes!

38
00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:12.865
Very good! Nice play!

39
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.781
- Good job!
- Come on!


40
00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:18.906
- Back to your position!
- Okay, get back to your position!


41
00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:23.281
- Good morning, Ms. Indah.
- Morning, Laras.


42
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.615
- Let me help you with those.
- Here, thank you.


43
00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:28.323
- All good with the Cahaya Cup?
- I'm drafting the proposal.


44
00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.115
But I might need to get some funding
from the students.


45
00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:34.031
- Make sure it goes well.
- Of course, ma'am.


46
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:36.740
Sherin, Sindy, Sasa!

47
00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.406
Classes haven't even started
and you're dancing already?


48
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.781
Turn your phone off!

49
00:07:44.573 --> 00:07:45.823
Bring those to my office?

50
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:46.906
Sure, ma'am.

51
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:50.531
Oops!

52
00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:51.948
"Sure, ma'am."

53
00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:55.365
- Scholarship students are ass-kissers.
- She has to be.


54
00:07:55.448 --> 00:07:59.198
Otherwise, how can she afford
to come to this school?


55
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240
Come on.

56
00:08:20.698 --> 00:08:21.698
Excuse me.

57
00:08:24.073 --> 00:08:25.198
Is Mr. Rizky here?

58
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.698
Not yet.

59
00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:35.323
I have to see him before class
about last week's remedial test.


60
00:08:36.031 --> 00:08:37.073
What am I, his mother?

61
00:08:37.156 --> 00:08:39.406
What? Aren't you his assistant?

62
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.490
What?

63
00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:43.615
- What do you mean?
- Is something wrong?


64
00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:45.698
I don't know.

65
00:09:04.865 --> 00:09:06.115
What are you doing?

66
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.740
Wiping this off.

67
00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:11.281
And soaking your shirt?

68
00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:22.448
Stupid girl.

69
00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:26.198
Hey. Have you seen the slut's latest post?

70
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:28.198
She's practically naked, again.

71
00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:29.656
Such an attention whore.

72
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.115
I don't understand Ms. Indah.
Why hasn't she expelled that bitch?


73
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.323
Hey, is the rumor true?

74
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.490
She did "it" with Arya in the gym?

75
00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:41.031
And all the guys at school, I bet.

76
00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:43.781
What were they doing in the gym?

77
00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.448
"Work out" together, of course. What else?

78
00:09:46.948 --> 00:09:48.281
I see.

79
00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:50.031
Did you hear that?

80
00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:54.781
Look, the Three Little Pigs.

81
00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:56.073
- Bitch.
- Come back here!


82
00:09:56.156 --> 00:09:57.781
Do we really look like pigs?

83
00:10:17.323 --> 00:10:18.823
Can you get me some toilet paper?

84
00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:26.615
Pass it under the door.

85
00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:00.823
You know my name?

86
00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:02.323
- What?
- What?


87
00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:05.073
Damn!

88
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:08.781
Hey, Dilla.

89
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.865
What were you doing with Dilla?

90
00:11:10.948 --> 00:11:12.656
Getting your shirt wet like that.

91
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.740
Whatever.

92
00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:17.740
A goody-goody church boy like you
getting on with a girl like Dilla?


93
00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:19.156
And Arya's hand-me-down too.

94
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.323
Chill, bro. I'm not possessive.

95
00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:23.406
Go for it.

96
00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.448
I need you to
make this graphic chart now.

97
00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:37.740
This is from yesterday.

98
00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:40.906
In the toilet. I'll give you some first.
Some first, okay?


99
00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:51.906
DILLA: DELETE IT!

100
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.448
GILANG: DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS ARE FOREVER

101
00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:56.948
DILLA: DELETE IT!!

102
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.115
Ras! Laras!

103
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:15.948
Poor Dilla.

104
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:43.656
OUR STORY

105
00:12:53.698 --> 00:12:57.115
<i>Once upon a time,
in a palace far away,</i>

106
00:12:57.865 --> 00:13:01.448
<i>a beautiful queen rules the land.</i>

107
00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:08.990
<i>The queen is surrounded by slaves
ready to fulfill her lusty needs.</i>


108
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.865
You are the fairest, your royal highness.

109
00:13:29.948 --> 00:13:32.781
<i>But the most special one is David,</i>

110
00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:36.823
<i>her favorite love slave,
always ready to serve.</i>


111
00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:39.156
<i>His body is always available.</i>

112
00:13:56.406 --> 00:14:00.698
<i>Many slutty slaves have the nerve
to flirt with her favorite toy boy.</i>


113
00:14:02.073 --> 00:14:03.656
I'm so sorry.

114
00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:11.198
<i>The queen is furious.</i>

115
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:14.531
<i>And curses the handmaid.</i>

116
00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:22.698
<i>But seeing David's wet chest,</i>

117
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.698
<i>the queen is suddenly overcome by lust.</i>

118
00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:34.656
<i>David has to face his punishment.</i>

119
00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:18.073
OUR STORY

120
00:15:25.198 --> 00:15:31.031
<i>Your light illuminates</i>

121
00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:37.865
<i>And enlightens my heart</i>

122
00:15:37.948 --> 00:15:44.823
<i>Teach me to receive</i>

123
00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:51.781
<i>Your Love, My Lord</i>

124
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:53.281
Let us pray.

125
00:15:55.406 --> 00:15:58.698
We are sinful
and unworthy of Your love, Lord.


126
00:16:00.948 --> 00:16:02.865
We are begging for Your mercy.

127
00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:07.323
Please forgive our sins, Lord.

128
00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:10.198
Please forgive our sins, Lord.

129
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.781
Have you asked your sister
about facial wash?


130
00:16:21.031 --> 00:16:21.865
What's up, Mom?

131
00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.448
Your sister's face is breaking out
from staying up late.


132
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:25.990
We can talk about it later.

133
00:16:27.406 --> 00:16:29.156
- Hi, Mr. Dedi.
- Hi, Mrs. Hana.


134
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.198
- How are you?
- I'm good.


135
00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:34.448
I heard David will be joining
the national training camp?


136
00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:36.656
David is being eyed by a recruiter.

137
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.781
That's why we are training hard
for the Cahaya Cup.


138
00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.573
That's amazing.
He'll be like you, the national athlete.


139
00:16:42.656 --> 00:16:44.698
- Which one do you want?
- What's in this?


140
00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:48.073
Rice noodles, carrots, potato.
Have you never had one?


141
00:16:50.073 --> 00:16:51.073
Cancel that.

142
00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:53.781
I'll take this one. 
What's in this?

143
00:16:53.865 --> 00:16:56.781
Same thing. You've never had this either?

144
00:16:58.573 --> 00:16:59.823
What's with the tone?

145
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.490
Forget it then.

146
00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:05.531
What do you want?
Fine, let me pick some out for you.


147
00:17:05.615 --> 00:17:08.906
God's children must be patient.
Haven't you been listening to the sermon?


148
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:10.740
Leave God out of this!

149
00:17:10.823 --> 00:17:12.781
My, oh, my!

150
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:16.240
You're not dating yet,
but bickering like a married couple.


151
00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:17.781
No way!

152
00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:18.865
How much?

153
00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:20.990
- It's free.
- No, it's okay.


154
00:17:22.323 --> 00:17:23.615
No, really.

155
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.990
Thanks.

156
00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:29.781
Thank you, Auntie.

157
00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:32.323
- Thank you, Mrs. Hana. Laras.
- Yes, Mr. Dedi.


158
00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:33.240
God bless you.

159
00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:36.740
You're welcome. We go to the same church,
we have to help each other.


160
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:46.031
They are all so handsome.

161
00:17:46.115 --> 00:17:47.115
Laras!

162
00:19:12.823 --> 00:19:15.740
I wanted to apologize about Gilang.
He sent out our picture.


163
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.740
Usually people don't give me flowers
with the pot.


164
00:19:24.448 --> 00:19:27.531
I thought doing this
would let the flower live longer.


165
00:19:28.073 --> 00:19:30.906
Well then, why don't
you take care of it?

166
00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:26.490
SOCCER TOURNAMENT CAHAYA CUP

167
00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:27.573
Yes, indeed.

168
00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:39.656
- Morning, Miss Vice President.
- Shush! Hold on.


169
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.531
"The tiger just transformed into David..."

170
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.615
Am I going to hell for reading this?

171
00:20:45.698 --> 00:20:47.990
But I just can't put it down.

172
00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:52.406
- Where did you get this?
- From Desas Desus. It went viral.


173
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.948
This gossip account on Twitter.

174
00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:55.490
David asked her to have sex?

175
00:20:55.573 --> 00:20:56.573
On a school trip?

176
00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:57.990
- Seriously?
- Oh my God!


177
00:20:58.073 --> 00:20:59.615
He's licking her?

178
00:20:59.698 --> 00:21:02.156
- Have you read <i>Dear David</i>?
- Here.


179
00:21:04.281 --> 00:21:07.073
Have you read the part
where David is a pirate?


180
00:21:07.156 --> 00:21:09.906
Oh my God, not yet.
I'm still reading David at the goat farm.


181
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.448
Oh my God!

182
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.865
Where?

183
00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:20.073
But his amnesia's gone after he's groped.

184
00:21:20.156 --> 00:21:21.823
Have you read <i>Forgive Me Father</i>?

185
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.406
David is a pastor!

186
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.573
- Seriously?
- Yeah!


187
00:21:24.656 --> 00:21:26.281
- Is it fun?
- It's wild!


188
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:29.281
ENDA HERIYANTO
IS THE WRITER A CAHAYA HIGH STUDENT?


189
00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:31.656
ANNISA KUMALA
OH MY GOD, END OF DAYS IS COMING...


190
00:22:40.156 --> 00:22:41.323
All the way!

191
00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:43.365
- It is, ma'am.
- Come on.


192
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.656
Not there. Up here. 
You're hopeless.

193
00:22:48.156 --> 00:22:50.615
And the other stuff. 
Laras, help me out.

194
00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:53.990
Get the shovel and the wires.

195
00:22:54.073 --> 00:22:56.365
- Yeah. Put them here.
- Okay, ma'am.


196
00:22:56.448 --> 00:22:58.323
- Laras!
- Anything else, ma'am?


197
00:22:59.115 --> 00:23:00.115
Wan! That one!

198
00:23:08.031 --> 00:23:09.031
Laras?

199
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.365
You missed your dinner.

200
00:23:22.448 --> 00:23:23.448
Are you okay?

201
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240
I'm not hungry.

202
00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:33.156
I'll make you some porridge.

203
00:23:37.573 --> 00:23:38.573
No thanks, Mom.

204
00:24:02.448 --> 00:24:07.406
The news about this pornographic writing
has reached the Foundation's chairman.


205
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.531
The school has conducted an investigation,

206
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.323
and found out
that the last story was uploaded


207
00:24:12.406 --> 00:24:14.740
from a school computer last Friday.

208
00:24:15.365 --> 00:24:18.573
This was the only computer class
on that day.


209
00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:23.240
So the writer must be one of you.

210
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.198
Whoever wrote them

211
00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:30.240
and distributed them
should come forward now.


212
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.281
So the school can do some damage control.

213
00:24:36.573 --> 00:24:40.615
This is not the first time
our school has dealt with pornography.


214
00:24:45.906 --> 00:24:46.906
Anyone?

215
00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:49.198
No one?

216
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:55.115
Fine. If the culprit
doesn't cooperate and confess,


217
00:24:57.115 --> 00:24:58.448
they will be expelled.

218
00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:06.990
Starting today, all students must report
every social media account they have.


219
00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.365
- What?
- How come?


220
00:25:08.448 --> 00:25:10.990
- Accounts should be set to "Public."
- You can't do that.


221
00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:12.698
No "Private" setting is allowed.

222
00:25:13.823 --> 00:25:15.990
- Just confess, Dilla.
- Why me?


223
00:25:16.073 --> 00:25:18.531
Your face says it all.
That's not a good girl's face.


224
00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:19.740
Trouble-making slut!

225
00:25:20.531 --> 00:25:23.156
I bet you're the one
who leaked the stories yourself.


226
00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:25.406
Sprint!

227
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.281
Okay, go! Quickly!

228
00:25:31.823 --> 00:25:33.281
GOOD LUCK CAHAYA CUP PARTICIPANTS

229
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.073
Laras! Come here.

230
00:25:36.781 --> 00:25:38.365
Sit down and look at this.

231
00:25:38.448 --> 00:25:39.740
I LOVE YOU, DAVID

232
00:25:39.823 --> 00:25:40.823
What's this?

233
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.073
Isn't he hot? No wonder
David has gotten 8K more followers now.


234
00:25:45.156 --> 00:25:46.990
- Disgusting.
- I edited that.


235
00:25:47.073 --> 00:25:49.031
- What? You made this?
- Cool, huh?


236
00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:51.490
Hey, the hype around <i>Dear David</i> is crazy!

237
00:25:51.573 --> 00:25:53.740
Why did we just
realize that David is hot?

238
00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:55.865
We've been lusting over Arya
all this time.


239
00:25:55.948 --> 00:25:56.781
Come on!

240
00:25:56.865 --> 00:25:59.490
- Guys, it's David's turn now!
- What? Oh my God.


241
00:25:59.573 --> 00:26:01.073
You go, David!

242
00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:03.656
Come on, David! 
You can do it!

243
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.406
Just take off your shirt!

244
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.948
Oh my gosh, I can't take this anymore.

245
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:09.406
What do I do?

246
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.073
David!

247
00:26:11.156 --> 00:26:13.656
David!

248
00:26:17.073 --> 00:26:19.490
Come on, David! 
You can do it!

249
00:26:19.573 --> 00:26:21.323
No!

250
00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:22.406
David!

251
00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:24.365
What was that?

252
00:26:24.448 --> 00:26:25.573
Focus!

253
00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:30.906
If you keep playing like this,
you won't even make it to the semifinal.


254
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:33.781
Do the laps, now!

255
00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:36.031
Yes, Coach.

256
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240
Next!

257
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.490
Just relax!

258
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.448
Go!

259
00:26:48.823 --> 00:26:54.615
"Slowly, she caresses David's eggplant,
and it's growing bigger..."


260
00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:56.240
Seriously? It's that big?

261
00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:02.448
Really? Let me see.
Is it bigger than mine?


262
00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:03.990
- What the hell?
- Show us, David.


263
00:27:04.073 --> 00:27:06.406
The biggest in Cahaya High.

264
00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.948
I've seen yours. I have.

265
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:11.073
But is yours truly that big?

266
00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:14.865
Hey!

267
00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:18.573
Shit!

268
00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:25.656
- Not funny, assholes!
- Why so sensitive?


269
00:27:26.573 --> 00:27:28.240
He's so sensitive!

270
00:27:44.615 --> 00:27:46.573
I'm sure David's junk is big.

271
00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:47.656
Gotta hurt.

272
00:27:48.573 --> 00:27:51.365
Why did David wet
his pants? Did he pee?

273
00:27:51.865 --> 00:27:54.031
I want to be a sex slave too.

274
00:27:55.115 --> 00:27:56.406
You have to read this.

275
00:27:56.948 --> 00:27:57.948
Read it.

276
00:28:00.156 --> 00:28:05.323
"But the handmaid accidentally
spills the milk all over David's chest..."


277
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:08.573
"David..."

278
00:28:08.656 --> 00:28:12.156
"The queen stares at David's...

279
00:28:13.281 --> 00:28:14.406
soaking chest!"

280
00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.906
This one.

281
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.281
Where is this one?

282
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.573
Before we begin today's session,

283
00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:34.448
would anyone like to ask for absolution
in front of your brothers and sisters?


284
00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:38.406
Yes, Abigail?

285
00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:43.323
I lie to my boyfriend a lot, Brother.

286
00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:47.448
Thank you, Abigail.

287
00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:54.990
You have to remember 1 Peter 3:10-11.

288
00:28:55.073 --> 00:28:59.490
"Honesty will lead to a peaceful life."

289
00:29:08.865 --> 00:29:09.865
Laras.

290
00:29:11.448 --> 00:29:12.865
Who do you think wrote them?

291
00:29:13.573 --> 00:29:14.740
I didn't write them.

292
00:29:15.323 --> 00:29:16.448
You didn't write what?

293
00:29:19.031 --> 00:29:20.156
I know you wrote them.

294
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.156
Here.

295
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.615
"'I hope you win,
to compete in the Cahaya Cup, '


296
00:29:25.698 --> 00:29:28.448
I said to David before the game began."

297
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:32.698
"When he is gone, I fantasize tying him up
and stripping him."


298
00:29:33.281 --> 00:29:36.281
This was after the election
of student body president, right?


299
00:29:36.823 --> 00:29:37.823
Need to hear more?

300
00:29:38.656 --> 00:29:40.323
This was in the computer classroom.

301
00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:43.073
"The handmaid accidentally spilled milk
on David's body."


302
00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:45.656
"I was furious,
but David's wet chest made my lust..."


303
00:29:55.073 --> 00:29:56.198
Fine, I wrote them.

304
00:29:57.906 --> 00:29:58.906
But why?

305
00:29:59.698 --> 00:30:02.156
If you have a crush on me,
why didn't you tell me?


306
00:30:04.573 --> 00:30:05.990
I don't have a crush on you.

307
00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:08.115
But in your writing...

308
00:30:08.198 --> 00:30:10.740
I picked a name randomly
from the school's student list.


309
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.448
Okay. So, you don't have a crush on me,
but you used my name...


310
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:15.906
What do you want, David?

311
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.740
To embarrass me?

312
00:30:19.823 --> 00:30:22.365
I've had enough embarrassment
from the whole school.


313
00:30:22.948 --> 00:30:26.156
You think you're the only one
who's embarrassed? What about me?


314
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.698
I didn't ask to be
the center of attention in school,


315
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:30.198
or on some gossip account...

316
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:32.948
I didn't leak it,
and I don't know who did, David!


317
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.740
I didn't want it to spread either!

318
00:30:45.115 --> 00:30:46.240
Okay, I'm sorry.

319
00:30:51.198 --> 00:30:53.948
I didn't expect all this would affect you.

320
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.531
I deleted all the stories.

321
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:04.406
I've stopped writing too.

322
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:06.656
Can you promise me

323
00:31:08.115 --> 00:31:09.781
not to tell anyone?

324
00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:15.198
If people find out, I'm done, David.

325
00:31:17.615 --> 00:31:20.615
But the problem is
now everyone looks at me differently.


326
00:31:21.615 --> 00:31:22.906
They expect more of me.

327
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:26.365
I'm just a nobody.

328
00:31:38.615 --> 00:31:39.990
I can't even get Dilla.

329
00:31:45.365 --> 00:31:46.615
So you like Dilla?

330
00:31:50.406 --> 00:31:51.531
Not just like...

331
00:31:54.073 --> 00:31:55.323
I think I love her.

332
00:32:04.073 --> 00:32:06.990
How is that possible
when you barely speak to her?


333
00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:12.156
I just know.

334
00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:26.115
David.

335
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:28.490
Why don't you just punish me?

336
00:32:28.573 --> 00:32:32.906
Make me do your homework
or take you everywhere. I'll do it.


337
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.573
But please,

338
00:32:34.656 --> 00:32:37.198
don't tell anyone I'm the writer.

339
00:32:41.406 --> 00:32:42.406
What if...

340
00:32:43.781 --> 00:32:46.406
you help me

341
00:32:47.073 --> 00:32:49.656
get close to Dilla?

342
00:32:50.573 --> 00:32:51.573
Me?

343
00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:56.198
You're the only kid at school
who was ever her friend.


344
00:32:56.281 --> 00:32:58.240
It's no longer the case.

345
00:32:59.698 --> 00:33:02.531
I give you an inch
and you take a mile.

346
00:33:02.615 --> 00:33:04.115
But you said "anything."

347
00:33:16.115 --> 00:33:19.365
Last month, the Foundation was this close
to having you expelled


348
00:33:20.073 --> 00:33:23.115
because of your pornographic posts
on social media.


349
00:33:23.198 --> 00:33:24.823
But I stood up for you.

350
00:33:25.698 --> 00:33:28.365
So please, Dilla,
let's help each other out.


351
00:33:28.448 --> 00:33:32.073
But you don't have any proof
that I wrote them.


352
00:33:33.781 --> 00:33:34.781
Dilla.

353
00:33:35.656 --> 00:33:39.656
Think about your future.
It's better for you to confess now!


354
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:50.281
David.

355
00:33:51.323 --> 00:33:55.031
Do you know who wrote these about you?

356
00:34:00.073 --> 00:34:01.073
No, ma'am.

357
00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:06.906
Mr. Rizky thinks
the writer is in your class.


358
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.573
But all traces have been deleted.

359
00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:14.781
You have the key
to the computer classroom, right?


360
00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:19.240
It means you could have gotten in anytime
to delete the trace.


361
00:34:20.656 --> 00:34:23.781
But I left the door open
from morning to afternoon.


362
00:34:23.865 --> 00:34:27.365
And sometimes the students use the room
during recess time.


363
00:34:27.448 --> 00:34:29.073
So, anybody could get in.

364
00:34:32.448 --> 00:34:35.365
You must've known who wrote the stories.

365
00:34:43.323 --> 00:34:45.531
When you spoke with David,

366
00:34:46.698 --> 00:34:49.073
did he tell you
who might have written them?


367
00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:52.656
No.

368
00:34:53.448 --> 00:34:54.781
He's also in the dark.

369
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.781
Hey, let's go to the cafeteria.
I'll pay for it.


370
00:35:01.865 --> 00:35:03.073
Hey, you know what...

371
00:35:30.823 --> 00:35:33.323
Steamed chicken from my mom,
for your dad.


372
00:35:34.865 --> 00:35:37.490
Thank you, Auntie Hana.

373
00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:42.948
Thanks for not telling anyone.

374
00:35:46.073 --> 00:35:48.198
Don't you want to find out
who leaked them?


375
00:35:49.031 --> 00:35:52.365
No. If I ask around,
people will suspect something.


376
00:35:56.448 --> 00:35:57.573
What are you doing?

377
00:35:58.615 --> 00:36:01.198
Planting this rose.
It was supposed to be for Dilla.


378
00:36:17.615 --> 00:36:19.365
Dilla doesn't like stuff like this.

379
00:36:20.531 --> 00:36:23.073
She's into music, camera...

380
00:36:23.156 --> 00:36:26.448
Yeah, I'm the biggest fool
when it comes to Dilla.


381
00:36:26.948 --> 00:36:29.031
I always get it wrong.
It was a bad choice.


382
00:36:29.115 --> 00:36:31.240
I'm telling you now
so you can take notes.

383
00:36:32.656 --> 00:36:34.656
You said you wanted
to get close to Dilla.

384
00:36:39.906 --> 00:36:42.323
One meeting, for you and Dilla.

385
00:36:43.781 --> 00:36:44.906
That's my only job.

386
00:36:46.156 --> 00:36:48.948
If nothing comes out of it,
that's no longer my problem.


387
00:36:49.031 --> 00:36:50.031
It's a deal.

388
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.156
- Hey, Laras.
- Hi, Uncle.


389
00:37:00.948 --> 00:37:02.906
Come, David. The game's starting.

390
00:37:03.573 --> 00:37:05.073
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.


391
00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.740
- See you, Laras.
- Yes, Uncle.


392
00:37:09.406 --> 00:37:10.406
Gotta go.

393
00:37:42.823 --> 00:37:43.823
Civica?

394
00:37:43.865 --> 00:37:45.156
Where did you steal this?

395
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.281
I bought it
with my Chinese New Year's money.


396
00:37:49.115 --> 00:37:50.115
For you.

397
00:37:57.031 --> 00:37:57.948
Can I come in?

398
00:37:58.031 --> 00:37:59.115
What for?

399
00:37:59.823 --> 00:38:02.031
- So we can talk inside.
- I'm busy.


400
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:06.073
- I walked all the way here.
- No one told you to.


401
00:38:07.448 --> 00:38:08.990
You know me, I'm dramatic.

402
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.115
I'm sorry if I did something wrong
and drove you away from me.


403
00:38:16.198 --> 00:38:18.406
You don't even know
if you did something wrong?


404
00:38:52.823 --> 00:38:54.740
Hey! Dildo!

405
00:38:54.823 --> 00:38:56.281
- My name's not Dildo!
- Come here!


406
00:38:56.365 --> 00:38:57.406
- Give it to me!
- No!


407
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.823
Ouch!

408
00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:00.156
<i>No!</i>

409
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.323
<i>La!</i>

410
00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:03.198
Ouch!

411
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:04.323
Are you okay?

412
00:39:04.406 --> 00:39:05.240
It hurts.

413
00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:06.406
But I lied!

414
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.406
Stop it! Go to hell.

415
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.531
- Give me the camera!
- No!


416
00:39:10.615 --> 00:39:12.198
- No!
- Give it to me!


417
00:39:12.698 --> 00:39:16.323
<i>Come on! Or I'll tickle you!</i>

418
00:39:33.031 --> 00:39:36.990
What's all this?
The parents' text group is on fire.


419
00:39:37.823 --> 00:39:40.948
There's some porn writing about David.

420
00:39:42.156 --> 00:39:42.990
What?

421
00:39:43.073 --> 00:39:45.240
The whole church
can't stop talking about it.


422
00:39:45.323 --> 00:39:46.323
Have you read it?

423
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.406
Why would I?

424
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.865
Poor David.

425
00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:52.448
They say he's not performing well
because of this.


426
00:39:54.156 --> 00:39:55.948
And poor Mr. Dedi too.

427
00:39:56.531 --> 00:40:00.656
You know he gets stressed easily.

428
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.948
The parents are making a petition

429
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:05.740
to find the writer and expel them.

430
00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:10.073
I'm curious what the writing is about.

431
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.531
They just sent me the link. Here.

432
00:40:16.406 --> 00:40:18.198
Just a little...

433
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:19.448
Don't read this stuff.

434
00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:21.948
- Just the beginning...
- No! It's a sin!


435
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:23.198
There, I deleted it!

436
00:40:23.698 --> 00:40:24.698
Hey!

437
00:40:31.615 --> 00:40:33.823
In light of the current situation,

438
00:40:33.906 --> 00:40:38.448
the student body and the school
will hold a sex education seminar...


439
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:39.531
Sex!

440
00:40:40.156 --> 00:40:41.573
Hey.

441
00:40:42.323 --> 00:40:45.615
...that all Cahaya High students must attend

442
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:47.990
at the last period of the day.

443
00:40:53.365 --> 00:40:56.615
Each student will be called individually
to Ms. Indah's office...


444
00:40:56.698 --> 00:40:57.865
Sex!

445
00:40:57.948 --> 00:40:58.823
That...

446
00:40:58.906 --> 00:41:00.156
Sex!

447
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.406
Silence!

448
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.240
...will start with Gilang.

449
00:41:03.323 --> 00:41:04.906
Sex!

450
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.698
Gilang!

451
00:41:10.115 --> 00:41:13.156
Please come to Ms. 
Indah's office now!

452
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.573
Thank you.

453
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.156
Boys, follow Mr. Anton. 
Girls, follow me.

454
00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:32.073
Relax, this won't take long.

455
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.531
I'm sure this is
nothing new to you all.

456
00:41:35.615 --> 00:41:36.948
Especially you, Arya.

457
00:41:52.948 --> 00:41:53.948
Dil!

458
00:41:55.156 --> 00:41:56.156
Where are you going?

459
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.406
I'd rather die
than join your shitty seminar!


460
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.823
Listen to me...

461
00:42:00.906 --> 00:42:02.990
You'd better go back
before they see you.


462
00:42:03.073 --> 00:42:05.115
- Dilla, please.
- What's the deal?


463
00:42:05.698 --> 00:42:06.531
Do you miss me...

464
00:42:06.615 --> 00:42:07.906
Yes, I miss you.

465
00:42:11.406 --> 00:42:15.365
I miss all the stupid things
that can only happen when I'm with you.


466
00:42:18.156 --> 00:42:21.698
If you truly miss me,
then let's get out of here together.


467
00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:31.656
Fine.

468
00:42:37.198 --> 00:42:38.198
Fine, come on!

469
00:42:40.531 --> 00:42:41.531
Let's go!

470
00:42:58.365 --> 00:43:01.448
I've been alive for 17 years,
but never once did I play hooky.


471
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:20.656
CAHAYA HIGH
A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE


472
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.115
Watch out!

473
00:43:22.198 --> 00:43:24.490
Hey, where are you going?

474
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:28.198
Oh my God!

475
00:43:44.906 --> 00:43:45.906
It's raining.

476
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:47.573
Two, please.

477
00:43:51.448 --> 00:43:52.781
Thank you.

478
00:43:56.365 --> 00:43:57.490
Here you go.

479
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.990
My name is not...

480
00:44:03.281 --> 00:44:04.281
Whatever.

481
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.990
Have some.

482
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:18.406
It's hot!

483
00:44:32.698 --> 00:44:33.698
Here.

484
00:44:42.573 --> 00:44:43.490
Mom!

485
00:44:43.573 --> 00:44:44.948
- Yes?
- Dilla wants a shower.


486
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.281
- Hi, Auntie!
- Hey, Dilla! Where have you been?


487
00:44:48.365 --> 00:44:50.615
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

488
00:44:50.698 --> 00:44:51.615
No way!

489
00:44:51.698 --> 00:44:53.198
You're all soaked.

490
00:44:53.823 --> 00:44:55.323
- Take your shower!
- Okay.


491
00:45:04.656 --> 00:45:05.656
Your turn!

492
00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.073
Take this!

493
00:45:16.906 --> 00:45:17.906
La.

494
00:45:19.948 --> 00:45:23.365
Do you know
why people started calling me a slut?


495
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.615
Arya asked me
to be his girlfriend in the gym.


496
00:45:35.115 --> 00:45:36.115
I said no.

497
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.948
The next day, the whole school
thought I had sex with him there.


498
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:45.240
I was going to tell you.

499
00:45:47.865 --> 00:45:51.490
But for the first time in my life,

500
00:45:52.698 --> 00:45:53.906
I got called a slut,

501
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.198
and the whole class laughed at me.

502
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.323
Why didn't you stand up for me?

503
00:46:05.031 --> 00:46:08.823
I got a feeling
that's what pulled you away from me.


504
00:46:10.156 --> 00:46:12.073
You pulled away from me first.

505
00:46:12.156 --> 00:46:14.323
You were so busy
being student body president.


506
00:46:14.948 --> 00:46:17.365
But didn't you refuse
to sit next to me in class?


507
00:46:17.448 --> 00:46:19.990
- You were ashamed to sit next to a slut.
- Dil!


508
00:46:23.073 --> 00:46:24.156
You're not a slut.

509
00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:33.615
I'm sorry.

510
00:47:04.031 --> 00:47:05.365
Ready for Ms. Indah?

511
00:47:06.656 --> 00:47:07.656
Come on.

512
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.823
- Dildo!
- What?


513
00:47:14.906 --> 00:47:16.990
Ms. Indah didn't only punish me,
but you too!


514
00:47:17.073 --> 00:47:19.073
A little help? 
We can finish sooner!

515
00:47:19.156 --> 00:47:22.656
And go back to class sooner? What for?

516
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.448
It's better to hang around here
and watch you all miserable.


517
00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:26.656
You're a bitch!

518
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:34.073
I saw you playing with your phone
during math test the other day.


519
00:47:34.156 --> 00:47:36.615
Well, you know I suck at math.

520
00:47:36.698 --> 00:47:39.031
Of course I know. 
Want to study together?

521
00:47:41.365 --> 00:47:42.740
I'll invite David, okay?

522
00:47:43.948 --> 00:47:45.281
He's been begging me.

523
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:48.031
He's afraid he'll be off the team
'cause his grades are bad.


524
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.240
I feel bad for him.
Thought I'd do him a favor.


525
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.656
He'll just have weird ideas.

526
00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.781
He and I know you're not the writer.

527
00:47:57.865 --> 00:48:00.073
Tell that to Ms. Indah.

528
00:48:00.156 --> 00:48:02.115
And those Three Little Pigs over there!

529
00:48:04.906 --> 00:48:07.823
I'll tell David and
we'll set up a date.

530
00:48:07.906 --> 00:48:08.906
Okay.

531
00:48:09.573 --> 00:48:10.990
Speaking of David,

532
00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:13.990
have you seen the latest upload
on social media?


533
00:48:17.323 --> 00:48:19.323
I WASH AWAY MY
THIRST ON THE SOCCER FIELD

534
00:48:21.781 --> 00:48:23.740
Ms. Indah will be so mad at me.

535
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.781
I'm so emotionally invested!

536
00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:31.906
Too much sport though. 
I can't relate.

537
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:36.781
I like the part where David is tied up
to the goal post and gets stripped.


538
00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:40.406
You know what? 
I cried my eyes out

539
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.740
when David has to go to England
to play for Liverpool.


540
00:48:43.823 --> 00:48:46.781
- Me too! My eyes are still puffy.
- Oh, yeah!


541
00:48:47.573 --> 00:48:48.698
So sad...

542
00:48:48.781 --> 00:48:50.740
Why are you so obsessed with <i>Dear David</i>?

543
00:48:50.823 --> 00:48:52.323
It's so addictive!

544
00:48:52.406 --> 00:48:54.448
Now I want to try and write too.

545
00:48:55.448 --> 00:48:57.490
- Don't you feel bad for David?
- What?


546
00:48:58.115 --> 00:49:01.073
Besides, thanks to <i>Dear David</i>,
all the sponsors pulled out.


547
00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:24.281
Hey!

548
00:49:24.698 --> 00:49:25.698
You're still here?

549
00:49:26.406 --> 00:49:27.740
The semifinal's coming.

550
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.823
Let's study together tomorrow.
You, me, and Dilla.


551
00:49:35.656 --> 00:49:37.615
Tomorrow? Are you serious?

552
00:49:39.198 --> 00:49:40.906
I can't, I'm not ready.

553
00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.740
Tell you what.

554
00:49:44.573 --> 00:49:46.490
Imagine I'm Dilla.

555
00:49:48.781 --> 00:49:49.781
Okay.

556
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.073
It's hard.

557
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.281
Okay, hold on. Okay.

558
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.990
Okay.

559
00:50:03.198 --> 00:50:05.615
So, what do you like about me?

560
00:50:07.823 --> 00:50:08.990
I don't know.

561
00:50:09.073 --> 00:50:12.031
Don't give an answer like that.
Such a conversation killer!


562
00:50:14.073 --> 00:50:15.781
Okay, let me try again.

563
00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:20.740
I like your personality.

564
00:50:22.115 --> 00:50:23.115
Be more specific.

565
00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:30.365
I like how free-spirited you are.

566
00:50:33.573 --> 00:50:34.615
And brave.

567
00:50:36.198 --> 00:50:40.198
Brave to go anywhere, to do anything.

568
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:41.740
Come to think of it,

569
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.573
you remind me of my late mother.

570
00:50:48.823 --> 00:50:50.240
Total Oedipus complex!

571
00:50:50.865 --> 00:50:51.865
What's that?

572
00:51:03.198 --> 00:51:05.531
- Why are you so dressed up?
- Am I?


573
00:51:12.031 --> 00:51:12.865
I got it.

574
00:51:12.948 --> 00:51:14.948
Okay, come on in.

575
00:51:28.656 --> 00:51:30.865
Center point coordinates and circle radius

576
00:51:30.948 --> 00:51:36.531
x²-y²-4x+6y+4 = 0 is...

577
00:51:37.073 --> 00:51:39.156
Hold on.

578
00:51:41.323 --> 00:51:42.323
C!

579
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.990
It's D.

580
00:51:45.073 --> 00:51:47.031
You just have to find
the number derivative.


581
00:51:47.115 --> 00:51:52.948
(x-2)²+(y+3)² equals to 9.

582
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.156
So the answer is 2-3.

583
00:51:56.865 --> 00:51:57.865
Get it?

584
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:00.031
I get it.

585
00:52:01.073 --> 00:52:02.073
Good.

586
00:52:02.823 --> 00:52:04.240
Where are you going?

587
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.490
Bathroom. You want to come with me?

588
00:52:14.448 --> 00:52:16.156
Do you have any plans this weekend?

589
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:24.781
David.

590
00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:28.073
You know I didn't write <i>Dear David</i>, right?

591
00:52:29.865 --> 00:52:31.906
- I know.
- How did you know?


592
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:40.948
La, do you want some tea?

593
00:52:41.906 --> 00:52:42.906
Yes, please!

594
00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:00.490
- I want this one.
- Sure.


595
00:53:01.823 --> 00:53:03.948
La, what's your plan for tomorrow?

596
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:06.031
Let's go out!

597
00:53:06.115 --> 00:53:08.156
It's been a while since we hung out.

598
00:53:09.115 --> 00:53:10.448
I can't make it tomorrow.

599
00:53:16.365 --> 00:53:17.573
Actually, I can.

600
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:19.990
But I can't stay out too late.

601
00:53:20.073 --> 00:53:24.198
Yes! Can we take your motorbike?
My car's not available.


602
00:53:24.281 --> 00:53:27.823
Why don't we ask David to drive us?
I'm too lazy to drive anywhere far.


603
00:53:27.906 --> 00:53:28.906
What?

604
00:53:29.698 --> 00:53:33.615
We go to the same church.
We can go from there and pick you up.


605
00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.448
What's wrong?

606
00:53:40.156 --> 00:53:41.281
Is he bugging you?

607
00:53:42.365 --> 00:53:45.365
- If so, we'll just ditch him...
- Do you have a crush on David?


608
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.990
Hell no.

609
00:53:47.365 --> 00:53:49.698
You really need me around
to get close to him?


610
00:53:50.448 --> 00:53:51.490
What?

611
00:53:51.573 --> 00:53:53.490
I don't want you
to end up with David.

612
00:53:54.156 --> 00:53:56.281
Why not? Do you like him?

613
00:53:56.823 --> 00:53:58.198
Do you want me to like him?

614
00:53:58.698 --> 00:54:01.281
Well, if you do, go for it.
He's a good guy.


615
00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.656
Can we change the music?

616
00:54:31.906 --> 00:54:33.990
- I love...
- I love this song!


617
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.990
Since when?

618
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.948
Didn't you say it's too mainstream?

619
00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.031
I like it too, Dil.

620
00:54:45.198 --> 00:54:47.406
Your taste is not so bad after all.

621
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:02.531
- Are you okay?
- Sure!


622
00:55:05.615 --> 00:55:06.448
Hi!

623
00:55:06.531 --> 00:55:07.615
Hello!

624
00:55:09.823 --> 00:55:11.115
Hey, look.

625
00:55:11.698 --> 00:55:13.323
Clown fish. Looks just like you.

626
00:55:13.906 --> 00:55:16.073
And you look like the rock over there.

627
00:55:16.156 --> 00:55:18.406
Not even a fish, just decoration.

628
00:55:19.073 --> 00:55:21.323
So, you agree? 
You look like a clown fish?

629
00:55:21.406 --> 00:55:23.531
At least I'm not some piece of stone.

630
00:55:23.615 --> 00:55:25.448
- I'd rather be that than...
- Let's go!


631
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.406
I want to see the mermaids.

632
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:29.531
- Cool, let's go.
- Come on!


633
00:55:31.615 --> 00:55:34.615
- Mind your head!
- Sure.


634
00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:35.698
- All good?
- Yeah.


635
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:04.698
Laras! Picture time!

636
00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:05.948
Come here!

637
00:56:16.281 --> 00:56:17.198
Take a picture!

638
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:18.573
Come on!

639
00:56:22.948 --> 00:56:24.990
Look, I took these.

640
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:26.781
With Dilla.

641
00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:32.281
Say cheese!

642
00:56:32.948 --> 00:56:34.073
Bye...

643
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.615
Hi!

644
00:56:38.698 --> 00:56:40.406
Okay, thank you.

645
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:42.240
Thank you.

646
00:56:44.781 --> 00:56:45.990
Want to try touching it?

647
00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:48.281
It makes me cringe!

648
00:56:48.365 --> 00:56:50.365
- Give me your hand!
- David!


649
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:52.615
- It makes me cringe! David!
- Try it.


650
00:56:55.281 --> 00:56:56.448
It makes me cringe!

651
00:56:56.531 --> 00:56:58.240
I don't believe you. Just try.

652
00:56:58.781 --> 00:57:01.781
I don't want to! Why don't you try?
- It's okay!


653
00:57:01.865 --> 00:57:03.781
- So weird!
- Now, you try!


654
00:57:06.573 --> 00:57:09.615
<i>The pornographic story of</i> Dear David
<i>has gone viral on the internet.</i>


655
00:57:09.698 --> 00:57:14.198
<i>Until now, the writer behind these stories
is suspected to be a Cahaya High student.</i>


656
00:57:14.281 --> 00:57:15.365
Here you go, miss.

657
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.323
Just admit it!
This has been going on for too long!


658
00:57:22.406 --> 00:57:25.115
I want you to make an apology.

659
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.948
In writing!

660
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:29.865
Ma'am, anyone could have used my name!

661
00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:33.615
You're suspended for ten days!
I'm confiscating your phone.


662
00:57:33.698 --> 00:57:35.990
I didn't write them.
Do you even listen to me?


663
00:57:36.073 --> 00:57:37.073
Your phone!

664
00:57:38.323 --> 00:57:39.573
Your phone!

665
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:46.948
You can use this extra free time
for a little self-reflection.


666
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:50.990
And ask yourself
why you're such an attention seeker.


667
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:57.573
Dilla, I'm sure
you can be a better person.


668
00:57:58.281 --> 00:58:01.365
Ma'am, I don't want
to be a better person.

669
00:58:01.448 --> 00:58:02.990
I just want to be myself!

670
00:58:03.073 --> 00:58:05.906
I didn't leak or write
the <i>Dear David</i>stories!


671
00:58:23.115 --> 00:58:26.323
What's with the fishnet stockings?
Are you doing a fashion show?


672
00:58:32.823 --> 00:58:33.906
Lower.

673
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:37.781
- But it's only a centimeter too short.
- It shouldn't be too short at all.


674
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:39.906
Boys will give you weird looks.

675
00:58:40.448 --> 00:58:41.448
Yeah, whatever.

676
00:58:45.323 --> 00:58:46.656
This is too much!

677
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.740
You're the student body president.
You can put a stop to this.


678
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.573
My hands are tied.

679
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.490
Lower it.

680
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.740
Lower!

681
00:59:05.365 --> 00:59:07.281
I didn't expect it would come to this.

682
00:59:13.406 --> 00:59:15.865
I didn't know
Ms. Indah would take it this far.


683
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:23.073
What do we do now?

684
00:59:48.406 --> 00:59:50.198
if you want to
move to a different school?

685
00:59:52.573 --> 00:59:53.573
No.

686
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:56.198
I've moved around too much.

687
01:00:43.031 --> 01:00:44.490
Put this under the shirt.

688
01:00:44.573 --> 01:00:46.240
There are only a few pins left.

689
01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:48.656
There aren't many differences
if this is under it.


690
01:00:53.865 --> 01:00:56.281
CAUGHT! THE ALLEGED STUDENT THAT WROTE
DEAR DAVID SUSPENDED!


691
01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:59.365
IT'S GOOD, SO SHE CAN NO LONGER
SEEK MY BOYFRIEND'S ATTENTION.


692
01:01:13.323 --> 01:01:15.365
INCOMING CALL: DILLA (NEW)

693
01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:17.073
Yeah.

694
01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.573
Forget it. It's okay.

695
01:01:18.615 --> 01:01:20.656
Like this. Good enough?

696
01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.906
We tuck it in or not?

697
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:23.031
Yes, tuck it in.

698
01:01:59.823 --> 01:02:04.615
Cahaya!

699
01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:06.031
Cahaya!

700
01:02:17.406 --> 01:02:19.156
- David!
- David!


701
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240
Goal!

702
01:02:30.698 --> 01:02:31.698
Yeah!

703
01:02:53.031 --> 01:02:55.240
CAHAYA CUP COMMITTEE

704
01:02:56.823 --> 01:02:59.323
Get off the field, attention whore!

705
01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:04.573
Go away, slut!

706
01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:07.531
Now you're my boyfriend.

707
01:03:16.781 --> 01:03:18.031
You did it, bro!

708
01:03:20.698 --> 01:03:23.490
David!

709
01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:26.406
David!

710
01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:39.531
Based on your midterm exams,

711
01:03:40.031 --> 01:03:44.031
we decided to further decrease
your tuition fee next semester.


712
01:03:44.865 --> 01:03:48.240
We hope you continue to make us proud.

713
01:03:52.365 --> 01:03:54.365
Go ahead, you can cry if you want.

714
01:03:56.073 --> 01:03:57.406
Must be emotional for you.

715
01:03:59.406 --> 01:04:04.573
Mr. Rolla ordered 123 sacks of cement,
but you only sent him 119 sacks.


716
01:04:04.656 --> 01:04:07.115
He just texted me to complain.

717
01:04:07.198 --> 01:04:11.115
And now, the number of this green paint
is 021, not 020.


718
01:04:11.198 --> 01:04:13.073
Don't make any more mistakes.

719
01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:15.906
He's a loyal customer. 
I'm so embarrassed.

720
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:19.656
Yes, ma'am, sorry. I spaced out.

721
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.198
Don't worry.
I'll send over the rest tomorrow.


722
01:04:23.281 --> 01:04:24.281
Fine.

723
01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.156
What's wrong, dear?

724
01:04:31.365 --> 01:04:34.240
I got an extra scholarship.

725
01:04:34.323 --> 01:04:35.865
Praise the Lord!

726
01:04:35.948 --> 01:04:38.115
I'm so proud of you.

727
01:04:41.156 --> 01:04:44.531
Why the long face? 
You should be happy.

728
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:47.531
Wait here.

729
01:04:49.781 --> 01:04:51.865
This is for the retreat.

730
01:04:54.073 --> 01:04:55.073
Retreat?

731
01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:57.781
That's right.
The Church Youth Commission Retreat.


732
01:04:58.365 --> 01:05:00.115
Relax, I already signed you up.

733
01:05:00.198 --> 01:05:03.740
Mr. Dedi said David will be going too.

734
01:05:03.823 --> 01:05:05.073
It's fun, right?

735
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:08.115
You two can have fun there.

736
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:34.281
What's wrong?

737
01:05:36.156 --> 01:05:37.156
Nothing.

738
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240
Dilla...

739
01:05:43.115 --> 01:05:44.615
- Dildo.
- What?


740
01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:46.156
Call me Dildo.

741
01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:48.031
Come on.

742
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:51.406
Dildo...

743
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.490
Dildo...

744
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.990
Dildo...

745
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.698
Laras!

746
01:07:03.406 --> 01:07:04.406
I need to talk.

747
01:07:06.406 --> 01:07:07.406
Laras!

748
01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.490
What?

749
01:07:10.115 --> 01:07:12.156
Later. I want to sleep.

750
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:14.031
It's a long trip.

751
01:07:29.865 --> 01:07:31.656
The one in the middle is our villa.

752
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.740
Laras! I want to tell you something.

753
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.823
So, Dilla and I kissed.

754
01:07:38.615 --> 01:07:39.906
Yes, we all saw it.

755
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.198
Good then, my work is done.

756
01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:46.031
No... Not like that. I mean...

757
01:07:46.115 --> 01:07:47.365
we really kissed.

758
01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.823
And it's nothing like I expected.

759
01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:54.240
Maybe I need more practice?

760
01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:56.531
Congratulations.

761
01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:59.823
What? Why are you upset?

762
01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:01.865
Shouldn't you be happy?

763
01:08:03.823 --> 01:08:04.823
I'm not happy.

764
01:08:10.115 --> 01:08:12.740
Right, I haven't paid you
for your mission.


765
01:08:13.365 --> 01:08:14.740
What do you want? Anything.

766
01:08:15.406 --> 01:08:16.406
Sushi.

767
01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:18.865
Damn, so expensive.

768
01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:28.948
Dear Lord, we are grateful
for Your absolution...


769
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:30.698
for all our sins.

770
01:08:32.948 --> 01:08:36.615
Lord, we are also grateful

771
01:08:37.448 --> 01:08:42.406
for Your unwavering love
throughout our lives.


772
01:08:45.073 --> 01:08:50.823
Please teach us how to forgive ourselves.

773
01:08:53.906 --> 01:08:58.823
Deliver us, Lord, from this binding guilt.

774
01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:05.073
And please grow new seeds
within our souls.


775
01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:12.531
In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
Hallelujah, amen.


776
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.948
We have prepared signs along this path.

777
01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:23.490
Use your lights to follow the signs
to the next post.


778
01:09:24.073 --> 01:09:27.031
And don't forget
to ask the post guard for a token


779
01:09:27.115 --> 01:09:29.115
after you complete the game.

780
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:32.698
"Watch and pray

781
01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:36.365
so that you will not fall
into temptation."


782
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:41.948
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."


783
01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:44.323
Let's start.

784
01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:45.948
Come on.

785
01:09:52.115 --> 01:09:53.281
Will there be a ghost?

786
01:09:59.573 --> 01:10:02.490
Did you bring a spare battery?
I forgot to change mine.


787
01:10:03.823 --> 01:10:04.906
It's in my room.

788
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.781
Just use mine. 
It's bright enough.

789
01:10:09.781 --> 01:10:10.781
Want to hold it?

790
01:10:11.906 --> 01:10:12.906
No, it's fine.

791
01:10:31.031 --> 01:10:32.031
What's wrong?

792
01:10:33.656 --> 01:10:35.115
There's something over there.

793
01:10:36.948 --> 01:10:37.948
What is it?

794
01:10:38.656 --> 01:10:39.656
- A ghoul?
- Silence.


795
01:10:42.031 --> 01:10:43.031
Are you scared?

796
01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:45.531
If a ghost pops up,

797
01:10:45.615 --> 01:10:47.656
think of its head as a ball,
kick it hard...


798
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.198
Laras.

799
01:10:56.156 --> 01:10:58.115
Okay. Come on.

800
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.031
David?

801
01:11:41.115 --> 01:11:42.115
Vid?

802
01:11:43.156 --> 01:11:44.156
David?

803
01:11:47.198 --> 01:11:48.198
David!

804
01:11:51.615 --> 01:11:52.656
David, what's wrong?

805
01:12:04.198 --> 01:12:05.198
Wait here.

806
01:12:05.865 --> 01:12:08.865
I'm okay. I just
need to take a breath.

807
01:12:08.948 --> 01:12:10.323
Please, don't leave me.

808
01:12:12.448 --> 01:12:14.615
I'm going to die here.

809
01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.531
David, you're not going to die here!

810
01:12:31.823 --> 01:12:33.906
Can you not stay quiet like this?

811
01:12:39.031 --> 01:12:40.365
What do you want me to do?

812
01:12:42.865 --> 01:12:44.281
You like telling stories, right?

813
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:47.656
Tell me a story.

814
01:13:16.031 --> 01:13:17.240
Once upon a time...

815
01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:23.323
there lived a writer...

816
01:13:25.865 --> 01:13:28.073
in a cottage by the sea.

817
01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:34.406
<i>She is writing her new novel...</i>

818
01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:40.115
<i>but she runs out of ideas.</i>

819
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:44.490
<i>Writer's block.</i>

820
01:13:57.281 --> 01:14:00.781
<i>Then she meets a soccer player
on the beach.</i>


821
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.198
<i>Apparently, they both are running away
from the bustling city life.</i>


822
01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.281
The soccer player,

823
01:14:27.198 --> 01:14:28.365
what does he look like?

824
01:14:39.198 --> 01:14:40.698
He's well-built.

825
01:14:46.323 --> 01:14:47.698
He has clear skin.

826
01:14:52.448 --> 01:14:53.865
A thin mustache.

827
01:14:55.865 --> 01:14:57.365
His eyes are warm...

828
01:15:00.698 --> 01:15:03.198
but they can be piercing
if you mess with him.


829
01:15:18.406 --> 01:15:22.073
<i>In their escape, they grow close.</i>

830
01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.990
<i>They are enjoying
a simple life on the beach.</i>


831
01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.198
But as time flies by...

832
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:25.573
everything must come to an end.

833
01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.198
<i>The soccer player has to go home
for his game.</i>


834
01:16:32.281 --> 01:16:37.656
<i>And after the game,
he will marry his fiancée.</i>


835
01:16:52.615 --> 01:16:56.823
<i>Before he goes,
the writer gives him a letter</i>


836
01:16:56.906 --> 01:16:59.906
<i>and asks him to read
it when he gets home.</i>

837
01:17:15.573 --> 01:17:16.823
<i>What does the letter say?</i>

838
01:17:21.781 --> 01:17:24.490
Things she's always wanted to say to him.

839
01:17:29.781 --> 01:17:31.698
Why doesn't she tell him directly?

840
01:17:44.448 --> 01:17:45.573
She's afraid.

841
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.490
She'd rather try to forget everything.

842
01:18:03.906 --> 01:18:05.823
For him and his fiancée's happiness...

843
01:18:09.781 --> 01:18:12.656
the writer is willing
to sacrifice her own.


844
01:18:19.906 --> 01:18:21.990
But the writer also deserves to be happy.

845
01:18:28.573 --> 01:18:29.573
Laras.

846
01:19:26.698 --> 01:19:27.698
David,

847
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:30.323
what happened to you?

848
01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:34.406
Do you have panic attacks often?

849
01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:41.948
My mom had unstable moods.

850
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.031
Sometimes,

851
01:19:47.948 --> 01:19:51.573
she'd lock herself up
in her room all day.

852
01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:55.740
But whenever she was happy,

853
01:19:56.573 --> 01:19:58.865
she was the most pleasant person.

854
01:19:59.698 --> 01:20:00.698
She really was.

855
01:20:02.281 --> 01:20:06.990
When I was little, she took me
to the forest to look for a waterfall.


856
01:20:09.323 --> 01:20:12.990
But what happened was, we got lost.

857
01:20:15.865 --> 01:20:19.615
That was the first time I hyperventilated.

858
01:20:22.406 --> 01:20:24.448
Since I decided to take up soccer,

859
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.448
I often hyperventilate.

860
01:20:30.406 --> 01:20:34.406
At first, I thought
I had a heart condition.


861
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:37.948
But during the medical check-up
to make the team,


862
01:20:38.031 --> 01:20:42.448
I asked the doctor, and he said
there's nothing wrong with my heart.


863
01:20:44.531 --> 01:20:46.406
How did your dad
react when he found out?

864
01:20:50.031 --> 01:20:53.240
Dad doesn't know, and he can't know.

865
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.823
My dad left us when
I was in fourth grade.

866
01:21:13.323 --> 01:21:15.740
So I understand where you're coming from.

867
01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.365
Sometimes I think,

868
01:21:24.323 --> 01:21:26.990
"Did he leave because of me?"

869
01:21:30.823 --> 01:21:32.823
Maybe I'm not good enough as a daughter.

870
01:21:37.448 --> 01:21:39.698
That's why I want
to be a good kid.

871
01:21:42.615 --> 01:21:44.240
I want to be somebody.

872
01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:47.490
Make a lot of money.

873
01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:54.698
And have a cottage by the beach?

874
01:22:49.115 --> 01:22:51.073
CHATS 
- DAVID

875
01:22:52.781 --> 01:22:54.573
I WAS WONDERING HOW THE STORY GOES.

876
01:22:57.323 --> 01:22:58.948
<i>Years pass by...</i>

877
01:22:59.948 --> 01:23:02.115
<i>the soccer player returns to the cottage.</i>

878
01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:07.031
<i>But the writer is no longer there.</i>

879
01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.365
<i>He never read the letter.</i>

880
01:23:12.531 --> 01:23:15.365
<i>Maybe opening the letter
is too hard for him,</i>


881
01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:20.156
<i>reminding him of the wonderful times
with the writer.</i>


882
01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:22.865
<i>A long time passes.</i>

883
01:23:24.906 --> 01:23:26.365
<i>Finally, he is ready.</i>

884
01:23:27.448 --> 01:23:28.865
<i>He opens the letter.</i>

885
01:23:30.031 --> 01:23:31.740
<i>And it reads...</i>

886
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240
<i>"Dear David..."</i>

887
01:23:44.198 --> 01:23:45.740
You went after me...

888
01:24:05.865 --> 01:24:07.406
Want me to leave you alone?

889
01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:40.406
YEARS PASS. THE SOCCER PLAYER
RETURNS TO THE LIGHTHOUSE.


890
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:41.865
DEAR DAVID, I LOVE YOU.

891
01:24:41.948 --> 01:24:43.531
YOURS, THE WRITER, LARAS.

892
01:24:43.615 --> 01:24:46.990
"Yours, the writer, Laras."

893
01:25:12.406 --> 01:25:15.115
Dil, I just wanted to say...
What are you doing?


894
01:25:23.906 --> 01:25:28.448
I got suspended, ostracized,
and got bullied by the whole school.


895
01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:38.073
I promised Laras.

896
01:25:39.406 --> 01:25:40.948
Promised her what?

897
01:25:43.948 --> 01:25:46.740
I promised Laras I wouldn't say a word
about <i>Dear David</i>.


898
01:25:47.865 --> 01:25:50.948
As long as she helped me
get close to you, Dil.


899
01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:57.073
I'm an asshole, Dil. 
But Laras didn't...

900
01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:14.531
Laras!

901
01:26:15.323 --> 01:26:17.948
You need to know
about your text last night.


902
01:26:18.656 --> 01:26:21.115
- Sorry, I didn't reply right away.
- Vid...


903
01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:23.406
Just forget I ever texted anything.

904
01:26:24.573 --> 01:26:27.573
Dilla read it accidentally.
She knows everything.


905
01:26:30.031 --> 01:26:31.281
- What do you mean?
- David!


906
01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.490
We have to talk to her.

907
01:26:53.948 --> 01:26:55.073
Hey, it's Laras.

908
01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.906
The writer.

909
01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:02.323
Oh my gosh, Ras...

910
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:06.531
You're kind of cool.

911
01:27:06.615 --> 01:27:07.698
And poetic too!

912
01:27:07.781 --> 01:27:11.490
Student body president
with a damn dirty mind!


913
01:27:11.573 --> 01:27:13.031
Horny girl, bro!

914
01:27:20.198 --> 01:27:23.073
Enough! Shut up, all of you!

915
01:27:27.115 --> 01:27:28.115
Laras...

916
01:27:29.073 --> 01:27:30.406
Write us more stories.

917
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:36.406
PLOT TWIST! THIS IS THE REAL FACE
OF DEAR DAVID'S WRITER!


918
01:27:42.198 --> 01:27:43.198
Well, Laras...

919
01:27:44.365 --> 01:27:45.781
You're still not confessing?

920
01:27:47.656 --> 01:27:50.365
I'm confiscating your phone for evidence.

921
01:27:51.573 --> 01:27:52.865
No, ma'am.

922
01:27:52.948 --> 01:27:55.156
A cell is personal property.
You have no right...


923
01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.323
You want me to expel you right now?

924
01:28:10.073 --> 01:28:11.698
I'm sick and tired of this case.

925
01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:15.531
You have until tomorrow...

926
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:18.031
to confess.

927
01:28:29.115 --> 01:28:30.698
I know I made a mistake.

928
01:28:32.656 --> 01:28:34.281
Why did you have to tell everyone?

929
01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:37.031
I've fought for my scholarship,
my position...


930
01:28:40.323 --> 01:28:41.573
Everything is about you.

931
01:28:46.406 --> 01:28:48.698
I'm ashamed I was ever your friend.

932
01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:52.823
I feel sorry for your mom
for having a daughter like you.


933
01:29:20.906 --> 01:29:21.906
Laras!

934
01:29:22.573 --> 01:29:24.698
Laras!

935
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.990
I'm so stupid.

936
01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:33.406
I've put my own best friend through hell.
I messed up everything.


937
01:29:38.365 --> 01:29:40.115
If only I hadn't written about you...

938
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.990
Come on.

939
01:30:23.531 --> 01:30:24.531
You go ahead.

940
01:30:25.073 --> 01:30:26.073
I'm going home.

941
01:30:26.781 --> 01:30:30.240
Don't be afraid. 
God is forgiving.

942
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.406
It's not about God, Mom.

943
01:30:36.781 --> 01:30:37.781
Come.

944
01:30:43.156 --> 01:30:44.656
It's Mrs. Hana's daughter.

945
01:30:45.281 --> 01:30:46.281
Mrs. Hana's daughter...

946
01:30:46.323 --> 01:30:49.198
- Right, it's her.
- Her name is Laras, and her mom is Hana.


947
01:30:49.281 --> 01:30:52.365
Right, I had no idea
she could write such a thing.


948
01:30:52.448 --> 01:30:56.031
They go to church,
but the child is troublesome.


949
01:30:56.115 --> 01:30:59.490
She writes porn stories
and leaked it to everyone.


950
01:30:59.573 --> 01:31:00.865
Poor mother.

951
01:31:00.948 --> 01:31:02.906
Oh my God...

952
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.781
She's a troublemaker.

953
01:31:04.865 --> 01:31:07.906
Poor education makes problematic kids.

954
01:31:42.948 --> 01:31:47.448
You do know
I might get expelled from school, right?


955
01:31:48.115 --> 01:31:49.115
I know.

956
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:57.240
My life is over, Mom.

957
01:32:00.698 --> 01:32:02.948
If you get expelled,
just move to another school.


958
01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:07.615
If you can't get to the college you want
because of this, find another college.


959
01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.531
But it means I'm a failure.

960
01:32:10.156 --> 01:32:12.240
We're all failures
at some point in our lives.


961
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.698
But I want to
be more than that, Mom.

962
01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:16.490
And I know I can be.

963
01:32:18.406 --> 01:32:20.156
For me, for you.

964
01:32:24.198 --> 01:32:27.115
For me, having you as my daughter
is enough.


965
01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:32.698
I never ask for anything more.

966
01:32:50.198 --> 01:32:55.656
<i>For all Your blessings</i>

967
01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:03.990
<i>Thank you, Jesus</i>

968
01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:12.948
<i>Our praises just for You</i>

969
01:33:38.698 --> 01:33:39.865
Honey.

970
01:33:46.865 --> 01:33:47.865
It's okay.

971
01:33:56.906 --> 01:33:57.906
Dilla!

972
01:33:59.615 --> 01:34:00.615
Dilla.

973
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:02.615
I'm down here, Dil.

974
01:34:15.156 --> 01:34:16.615
What are you doing, La?

975
01:34:19.198 --> 01:34:20.198
La!

976
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.031
La!

977
01:34:29.948 --> 01:34:30.948
What's that?

978
01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.948
Antiseptic from your mom.

979
01:34:33.031 --> 01:34:34.656
No, that's gonna hurt like hell.

980
01:34:35.656 --> 01:34:37.906
- Let me see it.
- No! Just a little!


981
01:34:39.448 --> 01:34:40.448
Oh my...

982
01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.781
It hurts! Enough!

983
01:34:42.865 --> 01:34:44.240
It hurts so much!

984
01:34:44.323 --> 01:34:45.531
All right...

985
01:34:45.615 --> 01:34:47.323
It hurts!

986
01:34:50.823 --> 01:34:51.823
It hurts.

987
01:34:57.698 --> 01:34:58.698
Ouch.

988
01:35:05.906 --> 01:35:07.406
I want you to go home now.

989
01:35:09.156 --> 01:35:10.823
If you want me
to go home, drive me.

990
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:14.615
You know what? 
You're such a handful.

991
01:35:29.906 --> 01:35:31.615
I'm not a good friend to you, Dil.

992
01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:38.531
I'm a bad friend.

993
01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:43.531
You're a bad friend.
You got me into trouble and you're stupid.


994
01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:51.281
You set me up with David
even though you have a crush on him.


995
01:35:55.781 --> 01:35:58.365
Now what do you regret the most?

996
01:35:59.406 --> 01:36:01.990
The fact that everyone knows
you're the porn writer,


997
01:36:02.948 --> 01:36:05.323
or the fact
that you got me together with David?


998
01:36:11.948 --> 01:36:13.615
The fact that I hurt you, Dil.

999
01:36:32.531 --> 01:36:34.448
I'm used to getting hurt by you.

1000
01:36:37.615 --> 01:36:39.323
You don't even realize it, do you?

1001
01:36:40.365 --> 01:36:43.073
How much I hurt
every day because of you.

1002
01:36:57.198 --> 01:36:59.073
Do you know what it feels like

1003
01:36:59.156 --> 01:37:02.990
to love someone who doesn't love you back?

1004
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.406
But I do love you.

1005
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:09.656
Yeah, as a friend, right?

1006
01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:25.531
Why didn't you tell me?

1007
01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:44.115
But I can't...

1008
01:37:46.948 --> 01:37:49.990
I can't have you
see me as a freak.

1009
01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:03.281
Dil...

1010
01:38:04.615 --> 01:38:05.740
You are not a freak.

1011
01:38:08.948 --> 01:38:10.865
I don't want to lose you, La.

1012
01:38:11.448 --> 01:38:13.490
You won't.

1013
01:38:15.198 --> 01:38:16.865
In fact, I'm thankful

1014
01:38:17.906 --> 01:38:20.615
that someone has been loving me
all this time.


1015
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.156
And that someone is you.

1016
01:38:28.031 --> 01:38:31.406
So I don't want you to go through
all this alone.


1017
01:38:38.365 --> 01:38:40.115
And I'll be here for you.

1018
01:38:50.448 --> 01:38:52.823
A lot of people
want you to get expelled.

1019
01:38:54.490 --> 01:38:57.990
Don't ask me how many parents
came directly to me,


1020
01:38:58.906 --> 01:39:02.406
to the Foundation, even your own friends.

1021
01:39:06.198 --> 01:39:07.698
But I'm still fighting.

1022
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:13.323
We've decided not to expel you.

1023
01:39:15.448 --> 01:39:18.073
Thank you, ma'am. 
Thank you so much.

1024
01:39:18.948 --> 01:39:20.740
You'll need to issue an apology.

1025
01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:23.698
Here's the draft.

1026
01:39:26.906 --> 01:39:29.448
You have to make this statement
during the flag ceremony.


1027
01:39:30.573 --> 01:39:32.198
We will revoke your scholarship.

1028
01:39:33.615 --> 01:39:36.865
But you may stay
because of your academic achievement.


1029
01:39:38.156 --> 01:39:42.990
We need you so we can become
the top-ranking school in Jakarta.


1030
01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:48.240
So, we are helping each other here.
Do you understand?


1031
01:39:54.281 --> 01:39:56.490
How about the person
who leaked the stories?


1032
01:39:58.115 --> 01:40:00.115
We suspect that Arya did it.

1033
01:40:02.781 --> 01:40:05.406
So, we'll both apologize this Monday?

1034
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:06.490
No, just you.

1035
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:08.406
Just me?

1036
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:11.156
Well, you're the one
who wrote the stories.


1037
01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.240
So, you're the one to apologize

1038
01:40:13.323 --> 01:40:15.656
for causing trouble
and disgracing the school.


1039
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.073
But it's not fair, ma'am!

1040
01:40:19.365 --> 01:40:21.698
Or do you prefer to get expelled?

1041
01:40:25.531 --> 01:40:26.740
So you leaked it?

1042
01:40:27.656 --> 01:40:28.740
David!

1043
01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:30.990
- David!
- Have you lost your mind?


1044
01:40:31.073 --> 01:40:32.865
- Stop it!
- You're all out of your minds!


1045
01:40:35.573 --> 01:40:37.031
Why did you leak them?

1046
01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.698
I just thought it's funny.

1047
01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:41.281
But you see? Now you're the school hero.

1048
01:40:41.906 --> 01:40:43.698
Let's get out of here!

1049
01:41:14.823 --> 01:41:15.906
Come on!

1050
01:41:17.156 --> 01:41:18.156
David!

1051
01:41:21.323 --> 01:41:22.656
Guys, let's go!

1052
01:41:23.573 --> 01:41:26.740
Cahaya!

1053
01:41:28.365 --> 01:41:30.781
Let's go, boys! Let's go! 
You can do this.

1054
01:41:30.865 --> 01:41:32.323
We can do it!

1055
01:41:32.406 --> 01:41:33.406
Come on!

1056
01:41:34.115 --> 01:41:37.198
Focus! Communicate with each other!
Let's win this, okay?


1057
01:41:37.281 --> 01:41:38.406
Let's go!

1058
01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:39.740
Let's go!

1059
01:41:39.823 --> 01:41:41.323
Three, two, one! Cahaya!

1060
01:41:41.406 --> 01:41:42.698
Come on! You can do it!

1061
01:41:45.615 --> 01:41:47.198
Go, Cahaya!

1062
01:41:47.281 --> 01:41:49.115
Go, David!

1063
01:42:11.948 --> 01:42:13.740
- What's going on?
- David!


1064
01:42:13.823 --> 01:42:15.990
What's wrong with David?

1065
01:42:16.073 --> 01:42:16.906
David.

1066
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:18.281
- Are you okay?
- David!


1067
01:42:18.823 --> 01:42:20.281
You take his place.

1068
01:42:20.365 --> 01:42:21.365
What's with him?

1069
01:42:34.698 --> 01:42:36.240
David, what's wrong?

1070
01:42:36.323 --> 01:42:37.781
I'm okay, Dad.

1071
01:42:37.865 --> 01:42:41.531
You're having a panic attack.
Take a breath slowly.


1072
01:42:46.448 --> 01:42:47.448
Vid!

1073
01:42:49.156 --> 01:42:51.406
Just take a breath!

1074
01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:53.990
I don't know, Dad.

1075
01:42:55.198 --> 01:42:56.198
I feel like...

1076
01:42:58.115 --> 01:42:59.365
I'm going crazy.

1077
01:43:01.115 --> 01:43:03.156
Calm down, Vid.

1078
01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.531
Easy now.

1079
01:43:05.323 --> 01:43:06.573
Relax.

1080
01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.115
Calm down. Breathe...

1081
01:43:11.031 --> 01:43:14.698
I don't want to end up like Mom.

1082
01:43:16.448 --> 01:43:17.448
Come here.

1083
01:43:36.073 --> 01:43:40.823
CERTIFICATE 
- AWARD

1084
01:44:34.198 --> 01:44:37.323
I'd like to invite Laras
from Class XI A IPS to the stage


1085
01:44:37.406 --> 01:44:39.615
to say an important message.

1086
01:44:41.906 --> 01:44:43.031
Quiet, everyone!

1087
01:44:44.906 --> 01:44:45.906
Laras...

1088
01:45:02.323 --> 01:45:03.990
Good morning, Ms. Principal,

1089
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.990
the teachers and staff,
and my dear friends.


1090
01:45:10.031 --> 01:45:13.156
My name is Laras Susanto,
and I'd like to say a few words.


1091
01:45:23.531 --> 01:45:24.531
First...

1092
01:45:26.365 --> 01:45:28.198
I would like to apologize to David,

1093
01:45:30.281 --> 01:45:33.281
for making him an object in my writing.

1094
01:45:42.198 --> 01:45:43.490
Secondly...

1095
01:45:46.115 --> 01:45:49.115
my sincerest apology
to my best friend, Dilla,


1096
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:53.156
who, because of my dishonesty,

1097
01:45:53.906 --> 01:45:57.115
had to endure hatred and bullying
from her schoolmates,


1098
01:45:58.656 --> 01:46:01.656
including the teachers and the principal.

1099
01:46:06.073 --> 01:46:07.740
My congratulations to Arya

1100
01:46:07.823 --> 01:46:10.490
for leaking and sharing my writing.

1101
01:46:11.906 --> 01:46:16.406
Those stories were not supposed to be read
and enjoyed by anyone but myself!


1102
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:18.198
Enjoyed?

1103
01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:28.031
I also congratulate the school,
an educational institution,


1104
01:46:28.781 --> 01:46:31.865
that claims it has enforced justice

1105
01:46:32.781 --> 01:46:35.531
by only punishing me,

1106
01:46:35.615 --> 01:46:38.365
and not the one who violated my rights.

1107
01:46:41.073 --> 01:46:43.531
To this school,
private spaces don't mean shit.


1108
01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.281
And lastly...

1109
01:46:56.656 --> 01:46:58.906
I want to apologize to myself.

1110
01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:03.740
I shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty.

1111
01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.698
I'm a passionate, young person...

1112
01:47:15.698 --> 01:47:17.781
and a woman in love.

1113
01:47:20.031 --> 01:47:21.198
Is that wrong?

1114
01:47:23.781 --> 01:47:24.990
I don't think so.

1115
01:47:25.073 --> 01:47:26.365
Yeah, Laras!

1116
01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:34.031
Silence!

1117
01:47:35.031 --> 01:47:36.031
Go, Laras!

1118
01:47:36.781 --> 01:47:37.781
Silence!

1119
01:47:40.365 --> 01:47:41.365
Laras!

1120
01:47:51.073 --> 01:47:54.323
With all due respect, we are asking you

1121
01:47:55.115 --> 01:47:57.948
not to continue your senior year
in Cahaya High School.


1122
01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:00.073
Very well, ma'am.

1123
01:48:37.531 --> 01:48:38.656
You rock!

1124
01:48:44.448 --> 01:48:45.448
"Dear David,

1125
01:48:46.323 --> 01:48:47.865
I love you."

1126
01:48:47.948 --> 01:48:50.198
"Yours, the writer, Laras."

1127
01:48:52.365 --> 01:48:55.073
I just want to say that I also...

1128
01:49:22.115 --> 01:49:24.531
How does it feel
to swim with the fishes?

1129
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:28.323
Feels like...

1130
01:49:29.198 --> 01:49:31.156
I'm flying together with them.

1131
01:49:32.281 --> 01:49:33.448
- Flying?
- Yeah.


1132
01:49:33.531 --> 01:49:34.656
I'm Anya.

1133
01:49:37.031 --> 01:49:38.198
Dilla.

1134
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:44.490
Mr. David?

1135

Fendi...

1137
01:49:58.323 --> 01:50:00.281
Auntie, have you read <i>Dear David</i>?

1138
01:50:00.365 --> 01:50:01.365
Hey!

1139
01:50:01.448 --> 01:50:02.865
Don't give her ideas. Dilla.

1140
01:50:03.406 --> 01:50:07.948
I think Laras has so much potential
to become a famous writer.


1141
01:50:08.031 --> 01:50:10.906
You're dead. Mom, don't!

1142
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:14.698
Relax, dear.
I told you I will never read them.


1143
01:50:14.781 --> 01:50:16.073
Good.

1144
01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:32.781
<i>Now, she is making her way
through the jungle...</i>


1145
01:50:39.156 --> 01:50:42.990
<i>without having to find somebody
to make her happy.</i>


1146
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:15.448
<i>Because being her is enough.</i>

1147
01:51:45.448 --> 01:51:49.156
<i>And for the first time in her life,
she feels at peace.</i>


1148
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:23.948
What? Oh, dear Lord.

1149
01:52:25.156 --> 01:52:26.156
Ma'am.

1150
01:52:26.198 --> 01:52:27.198
Oh my!

1151
01:52:27.656 --> 01:52:28.656
What?

1152
01:52:31.406 --> 01:52:34.740
Wahyu?

1153
01:52:42.115 --> 01:52:43.198
Ma'am?

1154
01:52:44.365 --> 01:52:45.365
What?

1155
01:52:45.781 --> 01:52:48.906
Sorry. Was the order seven or eight sacks?

1156
01:52:50.031 --> 01:52:52.281
What? Eight?
