Long frame for taking in the big
skull.


166
00:17:46.072 --> 00:17:49.249
So let few play their part.

167
00:17:49.292 --> 00:17:52.687
Don't lie can make that call.

168
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.037
He'll understand.

169
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:56.647
Y'all stick to working the short
con,


170
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:59.520
you know, playing the tables.

171
00:17:59.563 --> 00:18:02.088
Let it come to you.

172
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:09.008
And remember, be here for the
dough, not to shoot.


173
00:18:09.051 --> 00:18:10.574
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: All you had
to do was earn.


174
00:18:10.618 --> 00:18:14.361
Sometimes, that meant violence.

175
00:18:14.404 --> 00:18:15.449
C'mon man, I'm just a cook!

176
00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:16.580
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Mad boy was
what


177
00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:18.234
we called the lucky Pierre.

178
00:18:18.278 --> 00:18:21.585
He had no game, so he never got
the choice end of the score,


179
00:18:21.629 --> 00:18:23.935
but he always took the fall with
the blue trap shut.


180
00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.894
I don't have your money!

181
00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:27.330
I don't have your money!

182
00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.289
You don't have my what?

183
00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:30.942
Fuck you!

184
00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.075
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Paul The
Pawn was off his fucking nut.


185
00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:35.077
He was also Carl's number one
player.


186
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:36.035
It used to be Nichols.

187
00:18:38.602 --> 00:18:40.126
Nichols got turned out.

188
00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:44.086
His team got kicked in,
remember?


189
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.044
Fuck you!

190
00:18:45.087 --> 00:18:45.957
Get--

191
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.222
So, uh, he owes Paul how much?

192
00:19:03.192 --> 00:19:06.456
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Me, I was
different from those fools.


193
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.111
I was a hustler, sure, but I had
a goal.


194
00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:14.899
And a hustler with a goal ended
up one of two ways.


195
00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:16.336
[INAUDIBLE]

196
00:19:16.379 --> 00:19:17.293
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Happy--

197
00:19:17.337 --> 00:19:18.251
Chicago.

198
00:19:18.294 --> 00:19:19.774
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Or dead.

199
00:19:19.817 --> 00:19:21.123
No, Boston.

200
00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:22.342
[INAUDIBLE]

201
00:19:22.385 --> 00:19:24.344
What the fuck is this, a
geography lesson?


202
00:19:24.387 --> 00:19:25.258
This is bullshit.

203
00:19:25.301 --> 00:19:28.435
I need some play [INAUDIBLE].

204
00:19:28.478 --> 00:19:30.654
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Cue Ball
Carl Bridgers.


205
00:19:30.698 --> 00:19:34.702
He was one of the best nine ball
players ever.


206
00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:38.880
Now, he was just a stake horse.

207
00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:39.968
You know, you never let a twist

208
00:19:40.011 --> 00:19:41.752
get between you and the tribe.

209
00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:44.625
You know what I mean?

210
00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:45.974
Yeah?

211
00:19:46.017 --> 00:19:47.758
Do you like arita?

212
00:19:47.802 --> 00:19:49.369
Because I love arita.

213
00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.505
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: The
shooting gallery.


214
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:58.334
Carl's own private fishing hole.

215
00:19:58.378 --> 00:20:00.075
He sunk everything he had into
it.


216
00:20:03.992 --> 00:20:08.736
At the end of the day, he took

217
00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:10.955
Snap it.

218
00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:13.044
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: One of the
things Carl taught us--


219
00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.308
never underestimate the
stupidity


220
00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:16.439
of the general public.

221
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:26.754
And never show your speed until
the mark gave you


222
00:20:26.797 --> 00:20:28.147
what you wanted.

223
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.714
If I don't have bad luck, I
have no luck at all.


224
00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:32.151
Fuck it, I'm done.

225
00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.065
You got me sown tighter than a
bull's ass tonight.


226
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.371
Ey, one more.

227
00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:37.199
I'll give you the five and the
break, c'mon.


228
00:20:37.243 --> 00:20:39.288
But uh, it's 20 a game.

229
00:20:39.332 --> 00:20:40.724
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Like an
Orange Crush--


230
00:20:40.768 --> 00:20:42.683
the five and the break.

231
00:20:42.726 --> 00:20:47.862
Wow, I have to be stupid not to
take that spot, uh?


232
00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:48.819
20 a game.

233
00:21:08.012 --> 00:21:10.145
Can you fucking believe that?

234
00:21:10.189 --> 00:21:12.365
I never shot stick--

235
00:21:12.408 --> 00:21:14.628
come on, you gotta admit that's
a hell of a shot.


236
00:21:14.671 --> 00:21:16.456
Run it back.

237
00:21:16.499 --> 00:21:17.544
Fuck that, man.

238
00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:18.501
I quit.

239
00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:26.727
Fuck.

240
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.126
[INAUDIBLE] gettin' you a
regular pay day.


241
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.303
You've been in dead stroke for
weeks now.


242
00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:38.869
You know what I say Carl?

243
00:21:38.913 --> 00:21:40.958
Give him a stick and he'll be as
cool as cool


244
00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.439
as the other side of the pillow.

245
00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:44.875
I'm playin' OK.

246
00:21:44.919 --> 00:21:46.181
W you say, son.

247
00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:47.051
OK.

248
00:21:47.095 --> 00:21:48.139
I'm going to bounce.

249
00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:50.098
So, you guys can talk.

250
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:57.061
See you later, [INAUDIBLE].

251
00:21:57.105 --> 00:22:00.935
That's some dangerous pussy,
son.


252
00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:02.241
You smell it?

253
00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:11.337
[INAUDIBLE] telling me that she
hear


254
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.600
about an ace nine baller coming
into town


255
00:22:13.643 --> 00:22:16.646
by the name of Tenderloin Tony.

256
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.606
Now I've got me some history
with this fool.


257
00:22:19.649 --> 00:22:22.261
In this town, he's supposed to
be back by Rockefeller


258
00:22:22.304 --> 00:22:24.393
[INAUDIBLE] wantin' to play
high,


259
00:22:24.437 --> 00:22:28.310
so I want to run a long cream on
him.


260
00:22:28.354 --> 00:22:30.791
No nine ball on this one.

261
00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:33.881
Consider yourself my player.

262
00:22:33.924 --> 00:22:35.317
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Moving up
in the tribe


263
00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:38.581
was like hitting the jackpot on
your birthday.


264
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:41.018
Nevermind Paul?

265
00:22:41.062 --> 00:22:42.281
Paul's having some problems.

266
00:22:46.807 --> 00:22:48.591
He's strictly front room from
now on.


267
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.338
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: It also
meant someone else


268
00:22:56.382 --> 00:22:57.600
was going to be moving down.

269
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.561
RADIO: Detective [INAUDIBLE]
expressed his frustration


270
00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:05.434
that the grand jury had failed
to hand out any indictments.


271
00:23:05.478 --> 00:23:07.828
The city with the number one
murder rate in the nation.


272
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:10.570
The savagery of the triple
homicide involving three


273
00:23:10.613 --> 00:23:13.747
undercover NOPD detectives is
remembered as one


274
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.096
of the most brutal slayings.

275
00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:25.715
Hiya, Bambi.

276
00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:30.024
They call me thumper.

277
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.468
Thanks for talking me up,
making me look good to Carl.


278
00:23:39.512 --> 00:23:43.472
So Carl made you his player
huh?


279
00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:45.126
Um, yes.

280
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:46.867
Thanks to you.

281
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.390
Thanks to me, right?

282
00:23:48.434 --> 00:23:55.136
So, I was thinking maybe--

283
00:23:55.179 --> 00:23:57.094
Yeah?

284
00:23:57.138 --> 00:23:59.967
Listen, I landed this stake
horse the other night,


285
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.491
and he told me that if I could
get him a player,


286
00:24:02.535 --> 00:24:05.276
he was going to give me a
finder's fee.


287
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.713
I need the money.

288
00:24:06.756 --> 00:24:07.888
So please?

289
00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:13.459
OK.

290
00:24:13.502 --> 00:24:14.373
Wait, Jez.

291
00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:17.027
Come on.

292
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:23.643
I can help you but if Carl finds
me freelancing, I'm fucked.


293
00:24:23.686 --> 00:24:24.557
You know that.

294
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.688
He won't.

295
00:24:25.732 --> 00:24:26.733
I promise.

296
00:24:33.653 --> 00:24:34.958
So where'd you meet him?

297
00:24:54.238 --> 00:24:58.286
Um, we can make a little money
while we wait.


298
00:24:58.329 --> 00:24:59.243
All right!

299
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.077
Hi.

300
00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:08.078
How are ya?

301
00:25:08.122 --> 00:25:10.080
I'm good, how are you?

302
00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.342
I'm doing better.

303
00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:54.081
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Who showed
your ass in a pool ball.


304
00:25:54.124 --> 00:25:55.038
You lost your stake.

305
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:05.048
And when I played with Jags, I
had fun.


306
00:26:05.092 --> 00:26:06.615
I just did.

307
00:26:06.659 --> 00:26:09.139
The hard part was not letting it
show.


308
00:27:14.857 --> 00:27:16.206
Fuckin' hustler dog?

309
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.992
Nah, everyone has their
moments.


310
00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:19.993
That's what I thought.

311
00:27:20.036 --> 00:27:21.777
He is part of a crew.

312
00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:25.041
Woah, woah, easy, easy.

313
00:27:25.085 --> 00:27:27.914
You watch your fucking back.

314
00:27:27.957 --> 00:27:29.089
Hey, how are you guys doing?

315
00:27:29.132 --> 00:27:30.351
Sorry, I got hung up. - You're
late.


316
00:27:30.394 --> 00:27:31.221
We're leaving.

317
00:27:31.265 --> 00:27:32.832
Where are you going?

318
00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:35.835
You know if he leaves, you don't
get your finder's fee.


319
00:27:35.878 --> 00:27:37.140
You any good, kid?

320
00:27:37.184 --> 00:27:39.360
It's going to cost you to find
out, all right?


321
00:27:39.403 --> 00:27:42.189
So that was him huh?

322
00:27:42.232 --> 00:27:44.757
[INAUDIBLE]

323
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.019
We made money.

324
00:27:46.062 --> 00:27:47.063
Glad we didn't make a deal with
the stakers,


325
00:27:47.107 --> 00:27:47.977

Hey kid, I saw your tat.

That means you belong to Carl
Bridgers right?

Where are you on your way to,
Shooting Gallery?


329
00:27:58.684 --> 00:28:00.729
What if I told you I was staking
in a rogue player

remaining anonymous.


334
00:28:13.002 --> 00:28:15.004
Got a name.

Ever heard of him?

341
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.547
He's a great fucking player.

342

See, I need somebody on the

You do that for us?

I'll pay you then.

I'll take that as a yes. Silence
is a yes.

They're fucking cannibals man,
I'm telling you.

No.

He invented pool.

Good thing I just finished
scrubbing.


461
00:38:03.026 --> 00:38:13.026
A clean office is a sign of a
clean establishment.


462
00:38:13.298 --> 00:38:19.304
That's why every Monday, I come
here for scrubbing day.

anything out?

well,

been hit.

00:38:55.253 --> 00:39:01.824

back.

00:39:04.131 --> 00:39:09.092
He think he got a chance to beat
me clean.


471
00:39:09.136 --> 00:39:14.097
So, we gon' run a slider on him.

00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:17.579
Gon' call out his stake horse,
and gon' set him up way.


473
00:39:20.147 --> 00:39:26.284

JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Carl laid
it out.


475
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.334
Make another game with Tony.

476
00:39:33.378 --> 00:39:34.596
Play him on the limit.

477
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.815
Make a show of it.

478
00:39:35.858 --> 00:39:37.469
Play the dandelion.

479
00:39:37.512 --> 00:39:41.037
The idea was, once Tony realized
the level of play in the room,


480
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:43.736
he'd jump at the chance to play
Carl next.


481
00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:45.346
That was the plan.

482
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.828
But I knew Tony's stake horse
was a fucking cop.


483
00:39:48.871 --> 00:39:51.134

488
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:05.497
OK.

489
00:40:09.283 --> 00:40:11.285
C'mon, get in.

490
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:12.504
Go for a ride.

491
00:40:26.605 --> 00:40:28.128
Look through those again,
anything stand out?


492
00:40:39.182 --> 00:40:45.406
That last one, in the room,

493
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.407
There's your video.

494
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:47.321
Yeah.

495
00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:54.197
But I wasn't in the room when it
went down.


496
00:41:10.823 --> 00:41:12.433
It's been the bane of my fucking
existence.


497
00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:17.395
Tape disappeared.

498
00:41:17.438 --> 00:41:18.396
Bridgers was in that room.

499
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:26.926
So Bridgers must be on that
table.


500
00:41:26.969 --> 00:41:28.493
Fucking fairytale.

501
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.932
Fairytales have happy endings.

502
00:41:32.975 --> 00:41:34.368
You want to know how this ends?

503
00:41:34.412 --> 00:41:37.676
DA deemed everything I had
circumstantial.


504
00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:42.550
No DNA, no weapon, no videotape.

505
00:41:42.594 --> 00:41:45.335
I lost my partner, my
assignment,


506
00:41:45.379 --> 00:41:47.163
eventually my marriage.

507
00:41:47.207 --> 00:41:49.296
Because you couldn't prove
shit.


508
00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:52.952
Because I couldn't prove that
Bridgers was the trigger man.


509
00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:55.476
You scratched on the eight
ball.


510
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.435
Yeah.

511
00:41:57.478 --> 00:41:58.610
But I got a plan.

512
00:41:58.653 --> 00:42:01.351
Hustle if you will, to get
what's owed.


513
00:42:01.395 --> 00:42:02.831
Starts with that table.

514
00:42:06.618 --> 00:42:08.358
I know Bridgers.

515
00:42:08.402 --> 00:42:09.751
I know what he likes.

516
00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:12.841
Especially, I know what he
hates.


517
00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:15.017
He hates Tenderloin Tony.

518
00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:17.759
So I called him.

519
00:42:17.803 --> 00:42:21.110
I told him I was a stake horse.

520
00:42:21.154 --> 00:42:23.852
[INAUDIBLE] high stakes game
with Bridgers, and if you


521
00:42:23.896 --> 00:42:26.681
want to be my player.

522
00:42:26.725 --> 00:42:30.468
And I need you to find a way
into the Shooting Gallery.


523
00:42:30.511 --> 00:42:34.907
Desperation makes people do a
lot of stupid things.


524
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.778
And that girl of yours?

525
00:42:36.822 --> 00:42:38.737
Desperate.

526
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:45.483
She led me to you, unknowingly
of course.


527
00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:47.223
So this whole thing was a
fucking setup?


528
00:43:01.499 --> 00:43:03.370
COP: Bridgers has that tape.

529
00:43:03.413 --> 00:43:05.633
Took it for insurance.

530
00:43:05.677 --> 00:43:13.119
He owns the one thing I need,
and I


531
00:43:13.162 --> 00:43:15.687
need that game to win it back.

532
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.297
I can't get it any other way.

533
00:43:20.648 --> 00:43:23.390
Why the hell would Carl stake a
videotape that proves


534
00:43:23.433 --> 00:43:25.871
he killed someone?

535
00:43:25.914 --> 00:43:30.440
Allow me to demonstrate.

536
00:43:30.484 --> 00:43:31.572
You know what a blank is?

537
00:43:35.837 --> 00:43:37.665
Of course you do.

538
00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:39.580
Fake bullet.

539
00:43:39.624 --> 00:43:44.019
All bang, no bite.

540
00:43:44.063 --> 00:43:46.718
Right?

541
00:43:46.761 --> 00:43:49.459
You know it's a blank, but
you're


542
00:43:49.503 --> 00:43:51.418
afraid to move aren't you?

543
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:52.462
Go ahead, move.

544
00:43:56.423 --> 00:43:58.077
I pull this trigger, there's
enough powder in there


545
00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.948
to send a part of your skull
right through your brain.


546
00:44:05.519 --> 00:44:10.959
You're a smart kid, but you only
got one move.


547
00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:13.919
Set up my game for me.

548
00:44:13.962 --> 00:44:17.139
Set up my fucking game for me.

549
00:44:17.183 --> 00:44:18.053
I'll let you take a walk.

550
00:44:24.103 --> 00:44:25.931
I gotta take this.

551
00:44:28.934 --> 00:44:30.022
Hello?

552
00:44:30.065 --> 00:44:30.936
What?

553
00:44:35.331 --> 00:44:37.682
It is the right amount,
Michelle.


554
00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:38.770
Hang on a sec.

555
00:44:38.813 --> 00:44:40.902
Is Katie in the same room with
you?


556
00:44:40.946 --> 00:44:43.035
Could you try just a little bit
harder to humiliate me


557
00:44:43.078 --> 00:44:44.906
right the fuck in front of her?

558
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.212
Yeah, well I happen to be in a
meeting


559
00:44:46.255 --> 00:44:49.694
here myself, incidentally.

560
00:44:49.737 --> 00:44:52.131
So I set up the game, you let
me skate?


561
00:44:52.174 --> 00:44:53.262
On my word.

562
00:44:53.306 --> 00:44:55.787
Could you do me a favor, will
you--


563
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.092
OK, so what is it?

564
00:44:57.136 --> 00:44:58.790
How much is it, according to
you?


565
00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:01.053
The right and proper amount you
blackmailing--


566
00:45:01.096 --> 00:45:02.837
Katie, hi, hi.

567
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:05.013
How you doing?

568
00:45:05.057 --> 00:45:08.538
No, no, we're not fighting.

569
00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:11.411
Did your mother get you to say
that?


570
00:45:11.454 --> 00:45:14.893
Yeah, well, you tell her 2000 is
easily enough.


571
00:45:14.936 --> 00:45:15.850
Hello?

572
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:31.431
I can't see my daughter unless I
send


573
00:45:31.474 --> 00:45:32.867
her a maintenance check in the
amount


574
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:35.783
that she thinks is right.

575
00:45:41.354 --> 00:45:44.705
So what do you say?

576
00:45:44.749 --> 00:45:45.619
We got a deal?

577
00:45:50.842 --> 00:45:53.496
There's something you need to
know about hustlers.


578
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.849
First, we're all about the
money.


579
00:45:57.892 --> 00:46:00.852
Now, you only just met Tony.

580
00:46:00.895 --> 00:46:02.505
Called him on the phone.

581
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:05.770
Told him you had some money to
play.


582
00:46:05.813 --> 00:46:09.338
As long as you got some money,
he's got an opportunity


583
00:46:09.382 --> 00:46:12.951
to make it offa you.

584
00:46:12.994 --> 00:46:15.954
What are you trying to say.

585
00:46:15.997 --> 00:46:18.652
I think maybe he's working a
double-dump on you.


586
00:46:18.696 --> 00:46:19.740
Can you do me a favor?

587
00:46:19.784 --> 00:46:22.612
Could you speak fucking English?

588
00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:26.399
Doing some business on you, with
Carl?


589
00:46:26.442 --> 00:46:29.489
Thought ever cross your mind?

590
00:46:29.532 --> 00:46:30.882
I don't doubt Bridgers could
talk


591
00:46:30.925 --> 00:46:33.623
the Virgin Mary herself into
picking up a hammer,


592
00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:34.973
but here's the thing.

593
00:46:39.629 --> 00:46:40.587
That was a blank.

594
00:46:43.764 --> 00:46:48.290
My other gun doesn't take
blanks.


595
00:46:54.775 --> 00:46:56.255
You set up the game for tonight.

596
00:47:00.825 --> 00:47:01.739
That hurt?

597
00:47:06.178 --> 00:47:07.092
Don't try to fuck me.

598
00:47:15.753 --> 00:47:16.579
Jez.

599
00:47:16.623 --> 00:47:17.929
Hey, what happened?

600
00:47:17.972 --> 00:47:19.060
This whole situation.

601
00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:29.974
What's with the bags?

602
00:49:30.017 --> 00:49:30.931
You gonna go some place?

603
00:49:38.243 --> 00:49:39.157
Not now.

604
00:49:43.422 --> 00:49:45.772
You're sweet.

605
00:49:45.815 --> 00:49:48.644
You don't understand.

606
00:49:48.688 --> 00:49:52.170
You have that one backwards
kiddo.


607
00:49:52.213 --> 00:49:53.432
You get to know me a little
better,


608
00:49:53.475 --> 00:49:54.520
you'll see this is what I do.

609
00:49:57.262 --> 00:49:59.960
What, run away?

610
00:50:00.004 --> 00:50:03.616
You don't think I know about
that?


611
00:50:03.659 --> 00:50:04.965
That's not what I meant,
Jericho.


612
00:50:12.842 --> 00:50:17.369
Listen, I'm an addict.

613
00:50:17.412 --> 00:50:22.809
It's just that instead of
sticking needles up my arm


614
00:50:22.852 --> 00:50:24.289
I gamble a lot.

615
00:50:28.946 --> 00:50:31.992
And what happens when you gamble
is that sooner or later,


616
00:50:32.036 --> 00:50:34.777
you have to leave.

617
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:36.388
You have to jet.

618
00:50:36.431 --> 00:50:38.433
Things got a little too hot.

619
00:50:38.477 --> 00:50:39.826
You gotta go.

620
00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:41.219
That's what I'm doing.

621
00:50:41.262 --> 00:50:42.568
It's all right.

622
00:50:42.611 --> 00:50:44.265
I would've.

623
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:45.353
You don't take what I say?

TENDERLOIN TONY: Did you know
that in World War II,


625
00:50:58.366 --> 00:51:08.072
Japs would use crystal meth to
give


626
00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:11.727
the Japanese pilots on the
suicide mission,


627
00:51:11.771 --> 00:51:14.730
right before they went off.

628
00:51:14.774 --> 00:51:17.603
They would fly off into the

629
00:51:17.646 --> 00:51:24.523
feeling better than they ever
did in their goddamn lives.


630

Hey, it's OK.

637
00:51:46.675 --> 00:51:48.112
Hey, it's OK.

638
00:51:48.155 --> 00:51:49.026
Close the door.

639
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:50.070
Close the door, Tony.

640
00:51:50.114 --> 00:51:51.028
Close the door.
