1
00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.129
He who merits...

2
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.761
...through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks...


3
00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:32.475
...is, however, not counted...

4
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.270
...among the members
of our Central Committee.


5
00:03:36.897 --> 00:03:38.564
And so...

6
00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:44.779
...we only can explain it
by reading this letter...


7
00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:48.616
...from the hand and word...

8
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.621
...of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.

9
00:03:56.792 --> 00:04:00.503
A self-explanatory letter.

10
00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.173
It says the following:

11
00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.426
Havana, Year of Agriculture.

12
00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:13.557
Fidel, at this moment
l remember many things:


13
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.103
When l met you
at María Antonia's house...


14
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:20.564
...when you proposed that l come
along...


15
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:23.776
...all the tension
involved in the preparations.


16
00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:29.198
One day they came by asking
who to notify in case of death...


17
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.619
...and the real possibility
of it struck us all.


18
00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:38.791
Later we knew it was true...

19
00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:44.839
...that in a real revolution,
one either wins or dies.


20
00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:49.718
I feel that I have
completed the part of my duty...


21
00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:53.222
...that tied me to the
Cuban Revolution in its territory...


22
00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:56.016
...and l say farewell to you...

23
00:04:56.393 --> 00:05:00.646
...to the comrades,
to your people, who now are mine.


24
00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:04.441
l formally resign my positions...

25
00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:07.236
...in the leadership of the party...

26
00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:13.450
...my post as minister, my rank of
Comandante, and my Cuban citizenship.


27
00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:20.457
Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.


28
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.796
l can do what is denied to you by
your responsibility as Cuba's leader...


29
00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:29.049
...and the time
has come for us to part.


30
00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:33.929
lf my last hour
arrives beneath other skies...


31
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:39.143
...my last thought
will be for this people...


32
00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:41.645
...and especially for you.

33
00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:08.672
Let me see you without the hat.

34
00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:16.388
You're the living portrait
of your father.


35
00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:21.518
You have the money?

36
00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:24.605
Yes.

37
00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:30.819
We could wait
until things settle down.


38
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:38.369
If we don't do it now, we'll have
to wait another 50 years.


39
00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:40.913
One more.

40
00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:43.499
One, two...

41
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.169
...three.

42
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.967
Aleidita, remember Mom and Dad
sit at the head of the table.


43
00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:57.346
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramón the seat.


44
00:06:57.973 --> 00:07:00.140
Here it is. Four...

45
00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:02.893
...and five.

46
00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.026
What is he doing?

47
00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:13.404
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.


48
00:07:14.864 --> 00:07:16.657
Go see what your brother is doing.

49
00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:16.300
Special representative
from the "O.A.S."?


50
00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:20.471
Yes,
the Organization of American States.


51
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.891
Just a second, please.

52
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.106
There's a man who is
a special O.A.S. representative.


53
00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:35.110
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.


54
00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:43.285
-Please, come in.
-Thank you.


55
00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:46.413
Mister,
may I help you with your suitcase?


56
00:08:46.748 --> 00:08:47.790
No need.

57
00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:08.402
I'm worried about Monje.

58
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.570
Why?

59
00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:13.907
When I asked him about
the 20 men he promised...


60
00:14:14.992 --> 00:14:19.204
...he said, "Which men?" as if I had
never talked to him.


61
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:22.791
It's okay.

62
00:14:34.887 --> 00:14:36.096
Apolinar.

63
00:14:37.598 --> 00:14:38.598
Serapio.

64
00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:41.017
-How old are you, Serapio?
-Sixteen.


65
00:14:42.812 --> 00:14:45.564
At sixteen,
a man already knows what he wants.


66
00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:50.736
Hello. I'm Camba.

67
00:14:50.903 --> 00:14:52.237
Ramón.

68
00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:59.619
Do you know who that man is?

69
00:15:00.413 --> 00:15:01.663
He came with you.

70
00:15:01.789 --> 00:15:04.332
The man you just shook hands with...

71
00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.251
...is Che Guevara.

72
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.549
-Are you sure?
-Yes.


73
00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:16.595
Could I shake his hand again?

74
00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:27.123
-Ramón.
-Ricardo.


75
00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:32.504
-This is Coco, Inti's brother.
-I know, I know.


76
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.340
-The farm is under his name.
-Braulio.


77
00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:38.677
-How are you doing, bro?
-How are you?


78
00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:41.638
-Miguel!
-What's up?


79
00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:45.684
-Urbano, how was the trip?
-Quite tough.


80
00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.482
Rolando.

81
00:16:56.737 --> 00:16:57.904
You're Inti?

82
00:16:58.072 --> 00:17:01.491
-It's an honour to meet you.
-The honour is mine. I'm Ramón.


83
00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:06.413
This is doctor Ernesto Maymura.

84
00:17:06.956 --> 00:17:10.876
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.


85
00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:14.087
-Where did you do your residency?
-At Calixto García.


86
00:17:19.176 --> 00:17:21.177
And so we fell asleep.

87
00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:24.389
Do you know where we woke up?

88
00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:27.684
-In the United States.
-In New York.


89
00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:32.731
We went right in with
our Panamanian passports.


90
00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:34.858
Everything was going smoothly...

91
00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:38.403
...until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!


92
00:17:39.572 --> 00:17:43.116
Braulio says, "Let's go
over there, they have hot dogs."


93
00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:47.662
So we got there, and
of course, the vendor was Dominican.


94
00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:52.334
The first thing he says is,
"Oh, but you're Cuban."


95
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.128
Braulio just looks at him.

96
00:17:56.923 --> 00:18:00.717
He served us the hot dogs
without another word.


97
00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:05.597
I made a mistake
and took the wrong flight.


98
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.726
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.


99
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.561
What did we discover?

100
00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:16.316
If you dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.


101
00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:20.403
Good one!

102
00:18:20.529 --> 00:18:23.406
To Bolivia or anywhere else!

103
00:18:29.914 --> 00:18:30.956
Brother!

104
00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:42.050
Let's go.

105
00:18:53.187 --> 00:18:54.229
Hello.

106
00:18:55.648 --> 00:18:58.441
-Eustaquio.
-Welcome, Eustaquio. I'm Ramón.


107
00:19:00.069 --> 00:19:02.153
-Salustio.
-Ramón.


108
00:19:02.405 --> 00:19:05.532
-I'm Pedro.
-Ramón.


109
00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:08.702
Paco.

110
00:19:08.828 --> 00:19:09.869
Aniceto.

111
00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:11.955
Tuma, this is Aniceto.

112
00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:15.208
Carlos.

113
00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:17.377
Tuma.

114
00:19:19.588 --> 00:19:21.673
-Willy.
-I'm Chapaco.


115
00:19:21.882 --> 00:19:24.676
I'll need a few days
to learn all your names.


116
00:20:59.814 --> 00:21:02.065
In the last conversation
I had with Monje...


117
00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:05.193
... I made it clear that if we really
want to change this society...


118
00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:07.487
...we are the ones
most capable of doing it.


119
00:21:07.822 --> 00:21:10.365
That's why the party
has to support the guerrilla.


120
00:21:13.369 --> 00:21:16.538
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.


121
00:21:17.665 --> 00:21:19.999
He began to talk
about his love for his family.


122
00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:23.002
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.


123
00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:27.382
That is why,
with all due respect, Ramón...


124
00:21:28.551 --> 00:21:31.845
... I don't think the party
will support an armed struggle...


125
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:33.805
...much less Mario Monje.

126
00:21:36.517 --> 00:21:38.768
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz...


127
00:21:38.894 --> 00:21:41.896
...and recruit
the best people from the party...


128
00:21:43.023 --> 00:21:44.566
...to join the group.

129
00:21:46.318 --> 00:21:48.862
First we have to meet Mario Monje...

130
00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:50.196
...as we agreed to.

131
00:21:50.364 --> 00:21:52.574
Not doing so would be inappropriate.

132
00:22:08.716 --> 00:22:12.468
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.


133
00:22:14.138 --> 00:22:15.180
Mario.

134
00:22:15.848 --> 00:22:19.058
Anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men...


135
00:22:19.393 --> 00:22:21.227
...conditions are right.

136
00:22:22.438 --> 00:22:25.398
When children work in mines...

137
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.945
...and 50 percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age.


138
00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:35.200
When these same miners
go on strike...


139
00:22:35.993 --> 00:22:37.702
...to improve their wages...

140
00:22:38.245 --> 00:22:44.083
...and they are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right, or not?


141
00:22:45.502 --> 00:22:48.838
If infant mortality rates...

142
00:22:49.423 --> 00:22:51.674
...are the highest in Latin America...

143
00:22:51.926 --> 00:22:54.510
...because of lack of hospitals
and medical care...


144
00:22:55.512 --> 00:22:57.430
...the situation is right for me.

145
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.101
If we learned something in Cuba...

146
00:23:03.604 --> 00:23:07.607
...it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle...


147
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.860
...has no chance of taking power.

148
00:23:13.113 --> 00:23:17.450
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner...


149
00:23:17.785 --> 00:23:19.619
...they will turn their backs on you.

150
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.539
You will die heroically...

151
00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:28.670
...but you have no hope
of achieving victory.


152
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:33.007
Then let's change
the name of Bolivia.


153
00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:37.470
After all, Simón Bolívar
was a Venezuelan, right?


154
00:23:38.264 --> 00:23:39.889
Comrade Monje...

155
00:23:40.224 --> 00:23:43.476
...your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che...


156
00:23:43.978 --> 00:23:48.147
...that Ramón, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.


157
00:23:48.565 --> 00:23:51.693
It's true.
Ramón is like Simón Bolívar.


158
00:23:52.736 --> 00:23:55.947
The party does not
endorse armed struggle.


159
00:23:56.282 --> 00:23:58.533
You are free to abandon it.

160
00:24:00.327 --> 00:24:03.162
And you will have
our support if you do.


161
00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:09.168
If you stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.


162
00:24:10.421 --> 00:24:12.213
As the head
of the Communist Party here...


163
00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:14.173
... I advise you to leave with me.

164
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.145
With a mojito,
you cannot grind up the leaves.


165
00:24:27.271 --> 00:24:29.522
-I know about mojitos...
-So you know you can't grind them up.


166
00:24:29.773 --> 00:24:31.941
You cannot grind the leaves.

167
00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:43.328
How are you?

168
00:24:44.163 --> 00:24:47.040
Come over.
Just a second, I'm finishing here.


169
00:24:47.499 --> 00:24:49.334
Then you have to cover it.

170
00:24:49.543 --> 00:24:51.294
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.


171
00:24:51.545 --> 00:24:55.131
No, I forgot something ―
on top of the cream, put cheese.


172
00:24:55.382 --> 00:24:56.549
Cheese.

173
00:24:57.301 --> 00:24:59.594
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.


174
00:24:59.928 --> 00:25:00.845
Go ahead.

175
00:25:03.015 --> 00:25:05.308
-Everything good?
-Yes, good.


176
00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:09.937
Why did Che change
the location of the camp?


177
00:25:10.939 --> 00:25:13.608
I think he wanted
to be closer to Argentina.


178
00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:16.861
He had contacts
waiting for him in Alto Beni.


179
00:25:17.863 --> 00:25:21.741
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.


180
00:25:22.409 --> 00:25:23.993
They support us.

181
00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:28.998
Che needed somewhere
to train for six months...


182
00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:31.084
...where he wouldn't be bothered.

183
00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:35.963
How is that Ñancahuazú region?

184
00:25:37.841 --> 00:25:42.970
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.


185
00:25:44.139 --> 00:25:47.558
In fact,
the few peasants who live there...


186
00:25:48.394 --> 00:25:50.603
...don't trust foreigners.

187
00:25:52.689 --> 00:25:57.068
The Soviets won't allow Monje
to make a deal.


188
00:25:57.611 --> 00:25:58.653
No.

189
00:26:01.198 --> 00:26:05.785
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.


190
00:26:07.287 --> 00:26:10.164
And we need to find out if
there's anything else...


191
00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:12.834
...that we need to send.

192
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.005
We also found a cave
which could be useful.


193
00:26:19.633 --> 00:26:20.633
Good morning.

194
00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:26.055
I told the men that I'm going back
to La Paz today.


195
00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:29.267
I'm resigning from the party.

196
00:26:30.686 --> 00:26:32.019
My mission...

197
00:26:32.688 --> 00:26:34.063
...is over.

198
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:37.024
-Okay.
-The jeep arrives this afternoon.


199
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:42.697
Why don't you stay in the camp
until the jeep arrives?


200
00:26:42.948 --> 00:26:44.490
I would like to be alone.

201
00:26:45.492 --> 00:26:47.910
I'll wait at the zinc house.

202
00:26:48.203 --> 00:26:49.287
Fine.

203
00:26:49.913 --> 00:26:55.209
I'll return on January 1 0th,
with my decision made.


204
00:26:56.837 --> 00:26:59.505
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.

205
00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:10.266
Coco, find Moisés Guevara.

206
00:27:10.934 --> 00:27:12.727
Tell him I want to talk to him.

207
00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:17.565
We're leaving in a few days
on a training march...


208
00:27:18.567 --> 00:27:21.277
...for about 20, 25 days.

209
00:27:24.239 --> 00:27:26.073
I'll go to the mines.

210
00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:30.203
I'll be back between the 4th and

211
00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:34.123
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's Carnival season...


212
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:36.792
...La Diablada in Oruro.

213
00:27:37.544 --> 00:27:40.755
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.


214
00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:46.552
You are our primary
connection to the outside.


215
00:27:47.387 --> 00:27:49.805
Your cover needs to remain intact.

216
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.600
You can't come back to the camp.

217
00:27:54.102 --> 00:27:56.562
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.

218
00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:01.526
And your husband?

219
00:28:02.236 --> 00:28:04.820
How are things? Did you
get the trip straightened out?


220
00:28:05.113 --> 00:28:08.407
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.


221
00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:11.953
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?


222
00:28:13.413 --> 00:28:15.081
We've been in contact.

223
00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:20.169
-What happened?
-I think he likes me.


224
00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:22.630
I know he likes me.

225
00:28:24.883 --> 00:28:28.177
-Should I try to see him again?
-Yes.


226
00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:32.974
Tania, when this thing heats up...

227
00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:36.352
...your job will make the difference.

228
00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.776
Here are provisions ―
sugar, eggs, flour ― what's needed.


229
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.619
The new employee, is he Bolivian?

230
00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:55.454
Yes.

231
00:28:56.456 --> 00:28:58.291
-How much do I owe you?
-No, keep your money.


232
00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:01.377
-No, keep it.
-We are neighbours now.


233
00:29:02.254 --> 00:29:04.338
-Take it.
-I'm not doing this for the money.


234
00:29:10.596 --> 00:29:12.638
I want to take part in your project.

235
00:29:13.098 --> 00:29:18.102
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.


236
00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.438
Okay?

237
00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:23.482
Go with Tuma to see our neighbour...

238
00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:29.155
...and tell him we need his help.
Involve him without offering much.


239
00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:34.285
Tell him that we'll pay
for what he carries in the jeep...


240
00:29:35.037 --> 00:29:36.370
...and nothing else.

241
00:29:36.997 --> 00:29:38.039
Tumaini.

242
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:40.499
Put a little fear in him.

243
00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:43.628
And explain to him that if he
betrays us he'll pay with his life.


244
00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.590
You can drive back and forth
to town in your jeep...


245
00:29:47.841 --> 00:29:51.594
...so you can buy the food we need
and we'll pay you well.


246
00:29:52.179 --> 00:29:54.180
Yes, sure, whatever you want.

247
00:29:54.681 --> 00:29:58.351
-Good.
-I have to tell you something.


248
00:29:59.227 --> 00:30:02.521
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.


249
00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:04.231
Okay, fine.

250
00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:27.171
You want some more?

251
00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:33.344
There were two
little birds who lived in a tree.


252
00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:38.891
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers, and sing and sing.


253
00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:42.395
One day a hunter came by.

254
00:30:43.146 --> 00:30:47.525
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.


255
00:30:48.652 --> 00:30:51.487
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.


256
00:30:51.905 --> 00:30:53.614
He saved his own life.

257
00:30:54.908 --> 00:30:55.950
It's a nice story.

258
00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.369
-It's good.
-It's good. I liked it.


259
00:30:58.662 --> 00:31:00.705
I really liked it.
I know what you mean.


260
00:31:16.304 --> 00:31:18.180
You junkie son of a bitch.

261
00:31:19.474 --> 00:31:20.850
We'll see.

262
00:31:35.532 --> 00:31:36.490
Good morning.

263
00:31:37.576 --> 00:31:38.993
-How are you?
-Good morning.


264
00:31:39.953 --> 00:31:41.495
This looks beautiful!

265
00:31:43.582 --> 00:31:46.292
I see the factory is doing well.

266
00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:52.673
-Good morning.
-Come with me.


267
00:31:55.427 --> 00:31:57.762
Can we come in? 
Show me the house.

268
00:32:01.933 --> 00:32:03.976
I see you are really busy.

269
00:32:07.564 --> 00:32:11.609
Soon. I don't know when, but soon...

270
00:32:12.027 --> 00:32:14.320
...we will confront the enemy.

271
00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:19.950
Our contact
with the outside will be limited.


272
00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:27.166
Some of us will die, and it's
sad to see your comrades die...


273
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:32.421
...because you can't help them
with your limited resources.


274
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.674
Food will be scarce.

275
00:32:37.135 --> 00:32:39.595
Sometimes we won't have
anything to eat.


276
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:45.184
And if all of this weren't enough...

277
00:32:45.685 --> 00:32:49.313
...we'll have to
endure the harsh weather.


278
00:32:52.317 --> 00:32:53.776
By the end...

279
00:32:54.653 --> 00:32:56.862
...we will have become human waste.

280
00:32:57.697 --> 00:32:59.949
That's all I can promise you.

281
00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:02.284
Think it over.

282
00:33:05.539 --> 00:33:07.957
You still have time to go back home.

283
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.626
Afterwards it will be too late.

284
00:33:13.171 --> 00:33:14.672
In closing...

285
00:33:16.967 --> 00:33:19.468
... I would like to repeat...

286
00:33:21.388 --> 00:33:23.180
...what I said to Monje.

287
00:33:24.975 --> 00:33:27.685
Me? I'm already here.

288
00:33:29.354 --> 00:33:32.189
They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.


289
00:33:32.983 --> 00:33:37.403
I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.


290
00:34:19.362 --> 00:34:22.156
How much corn can you
sell us right now?


291
00:34:23.283 --> 00:34:25.701
There's not even enough for us, sir.

292
00:34:26.036 --> 00:34:27.870
At least sell us a pig.

293
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:32.833
They're piglets, just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?


294
00:34:33.043 --> 00:34:34.710
Besides, they belong to the missus.

295
00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:37.796
How much is your pig, madam?

296
00:34:38.298 --> 00:34:41.383
I can't sell them,
they're only sucklings.


297
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.219
I'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.

298
00:34:45.263 --> 00:34:47.056
I'm not sure.

299
00:34:48.391 --> 00:34:49.975
How about 40,000?

300
00:34:50.393 --> 00:34:52.978
Should we sell or not?

301
00:34:54.814 --> 00:34:56.732
Make it 50,000, okay?

302
00:34:57.567 --> 00:34:58.692
Okay.

303
00:34:59.778 --> 00:35:01.695
What conditions do they live in?

304
00:35:02.572 --> 00:35:04.615
Very bad.

305
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.826
Do they have children?

306
00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:13.082
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.


307
00:35:13.917 --> 00:35:17.086
One of the little boys
has a badly infected eye.


308
00:35:17.754 --> 00:35:19.338
How old is the peasant?

309
00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:23.676
About 40, 50 years old.

310
00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:26.512
I think he's a bit older, you know?

311
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:33.102
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?


312
00:35:33.895 --> 00:35:36.438
His eyes sparkled
when he saw the money.


313
00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:38.607
Hello.

314
00:35:39.776 --> 00:35:41.151
Good day, Honorato.

315
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:54.081
Come, I want to talk to you.

316
00:35:57.752 --> 00:36:00.462
We want there
to be schools for your children...


317
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.716
...and hospitals to take care of them...

318
00:36:04.634 --> 00:36:05.968
...and roads to be built...

319
00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:09.138
...so trucks can reach here
and you can sell your products.


320
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.975
Don't you want all these things?

321
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.811
Well, yes, that would be nice.

322
00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:19.314
But in order to do this,
we need your help.


323
00:36:28.742 --> 00:36:29.825
Two...

324
00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:31.910
...and three.

325
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:33.996
Look.

326
00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:38.000
You are a big man.

327
00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:39.668
May God repay you.

328
00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:43.130
-It's all right.
-May God repay you.


329
00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.179
Okay.

330
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:54.016
-See you.
-Bye, madam.


331
00:36:55.727 --> 00:36:57.895
-Goodbye.
-May God repay you.


332
00:38:09.801 --> 00:38:11.051
What are you doing?

333
00:38:13.888 --> 00:38:15.597
That's communal food.

334
00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:20.310
No one helps themselves without
being given permission to do so.


335
00:38:20.603 --> 00:38:21.812
Understood?

336
00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:26.150
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.


337
00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:30.362
-Everything belongs to the group.
-But we're hungry.


338
00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:35.492
We're all hungry, Darío.
But one can feed six for breakfast.


339
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:49.131
There's one missing.

340
00:39:09.444 --> 00:39:13.655
I have no radio coverage
with the main camp so I'm going back.


341
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:16.658
No, big guy.
You're not going anywhere.


342
00:39:17.368 --> 00:39:21.121
Stay with us until six, then you
can tell Ramón how far we've gone.


343
00:39:21.247 --> 00:39:22.915
No, I'm going now
while it's still light out.


344
00:39:23.041 --> 00:39:25.626
Hey, I'm giving you an order!

345
00:39:25.752 --> 00:39:27.544
Stay here until six.

346
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.217
-I'm leaving now.
-You're not leaving, can't you hear?


347
00:39:33.343 --> 00:39:34.927
You listen to me, 
I'm fucking going.

348
00:39:35.053 --> 00:39:37.512
You'll have to
go through my machete first!


349
00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:39.473
-Hey!
-What's wrong with you?


350
00:39:39.682 --> 00:39:41.558
Hey, Miguel!

351
00:39:41.726 --> 00:39:43.560
What's going on here?

352
00:39:44.187 --> 00:39:46.063
Listen, listen!

353
00:39:46.231 --> 00:39:47.814
Miguel, look at me!

354
00:39:48.024 --> 00:39:49.608
Hey, you're comrades.

355
00:39:50.068 --> 00:39:51.401
"Comrades" for what?
He has to follow orders!


356
00:39:51.569 --> 00:39:52.569
That's enough!

357
00:39:53.404 --> 00:39:56.240
Miguel, you have to control yourself...

358
00:39:57.158 --> 00:39:59.409
...and give orders with respect...

359
00:40:00.495 --> 00:40:01.912
...like a boss.

360
00:40:03.498 --> 00:40:07.209
You cannot threaten
or hit anyone here.


361
00:40:08.586 --> 00:40:11.004
That's not
permitted by the guerrilla.


362
00:40:11.923 --> 00:40:14.424
And you know that better than anyone.

363
00:40:16.094 --> 00:40:17.594
And you...

364
00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:21.098
...lied.

365
00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:26.770
Miguel never hit you with the machete
handle. He didn't even touch you.


366
00:40:28.982 --> 00:40:31.275
The one thing I won't tolerate here...

367
00:40:31.734 --> 00:40:33.443
...is a liar!

368
00:40:34.112 --> 00:40:36.446
One more incident like that, Pacho...

369
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:40.242
...and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonourable discharge.


370
00:40:43.788 --> 00:40:47.249
Incidents like this destroy group
morale and our readiness for combat...


371
00:40:47.542 --> 00:40:49.751
...not only of you, or you...

372
00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:51.753
...but of the entire group.

373
00:40:54.257 --> 00:40:56.758
If anyone feels weak or discouraged...

374
00:40:58.136 --> 00:41:00.345
...he shouldn't resort to such methods...

375
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:06.059
...but should speak to the political
commissaries, to Inti or Rolando...


376
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:07.644
...or to me...

377
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:10.772
...and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.


378
00:41:41.387 --> 00:41:44.598
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.


379
00:41:51.606 --> 00:41:53.357
Listen to me.

380
00:41:54.525 --> 00:41:58.362
Ramón could be back now
in Cuba with his family...


381
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:04.076
...with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.


382
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:08.705
But he is here because he
wants you to have a better life...


383
00:42:09.749 --> 00:42:11.917
...so your kids
can learn to read and write.


384
00:42:13.795 --> 00:42:17.297
I'm just a baker,
I've been a slave all my life...


385
00:42:18.508 --> 00:42:20.425
...but some day I'll be free.

386
00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:28.892
Rest because
we'll be leaving at sunrise.


387
00:42:29.394 --> 00:42:32.396
-We're not staying here?
-No, we need to be patient.


388
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.899
We are taking you to another
camp where you'll be safer.


389
00:42:36.401 --> 00:42:38.151
Have you had any problems?

390
00:42:38.736 --> 00:42:41.780
There's a neighbour that thinks
we're making cocaine.


391
00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:45.242
The police have
been here twice already.


392
00:42:51.874 --> 00:42:53.917
When's the last time
you heard from Ramón?


393
00:42:54.377 --> 00:42:56.128
Over a week ago.

394
00:42:56.838 --> 00:42:58.755
We lost contact with the whole group.

395
00:43:01.426 --> 00:43:03.385
Moisés, hello!

396
00:43:08.766 --> 00:43:10.475
Who did you bring?

397
00:43:10.601 --> 00:43:13.979
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Perú.


398
00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:18.442
Are you going back to Camiri?

399
00:43:18.943 --> 00:43:21.027
I need to talk to Ramón first.

400
00:43:21.863 --> 00:43:24.906
Monje and the Party
are interfering with everything.


401
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:29.453
They even convinced the last
Bolivians that were trained in Cuba...


402
00:43:29.787 --> 00:43:32.789
...not to come here and join us.

403
00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:36.960
Hey, listen.

404
00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:39.004
Hey.

405
00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.630
Everyone keep away from her hammock.

406
00:43:40.798 --> 00:43:43.633
Whoever touches her will
be severely punished.


407
00:43:46.012 --> 00:43:47.304
Listen to me, Arturo.

408
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:52.642
They are Bolivian,
and they have come to fight.


409
00:43:53.144 --> 00:43:54.895
You must not disrespect them.

410
00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:08.992
I need two volunteers to go hunt
and I thought about you.


411
00:44:11.204 --> 00:44:15.248
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.


412
00:44:18.252 --> 00:44:22.547
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this!


413
00:45:37.498 --> 00:45:39.249
Hey, that sounds like a plane.

414
00:45:40.751 --> 00:45:42.085
Airplane!

415
00:45:44.547 --> 00:45:45.964
Come on, Ramón.

416
00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:54.264
Get down, Ramón.

417
00:46:21.792 --> 00:46:24.961
They caught two of Moisés' men
who deserted...


418
00:46:25.296 --> 00:46:26.796
...and they talked like parrots.

419
00:46:27.131 --> 00:46:29.299
Soldiers went into the zinc house.

420
00:46:29.634 --> 00:46:32.385
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.

421
00:46:32.637 --> 00:46:35.305
-Who gave orders to move camp?
-Antonio did.


422
00:46:35.556 --> 00:46:37.599
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.

423
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.977
-Bring back all to the camp.
-Okay.


424
00:46:41.479 --> 00:46:42.687
Rolando.

425
00:46:44.357 --> 00:46:46.566
Prepare an ambush.

426
00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.532
Was there anything in the jeep?

427
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.329
I had some
recordings of Fidel's speeches.


428
00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:04.542
They're going to search the jeep
which will lead them to the hotel...


429
00:47:04.877 --> 00:47:07.337
...and the hotel will lead
them to your apartment...


430
00:47:08.464 --> 00:47:10.632
...and your apartment will
lead them to everything.


431
00:47:11.676 --> 00:47:13.551
I couldn't trust anyone.

432
00:47:15.638 --> 00:47:18.556
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.


433
00:47:18.891 --> 00:47:25.146
-That's why I decided to bring...
-You had strict orders not to return.


434
00:47:26.232 --> 00:47:30.318
That's five years of lost work.

435
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.154
Tania, five!

436
00:47:34.323 --> 00:47:35.657
Give me your rifle.

437
00:47:37.785 --> 00:47:41.287
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.


438
00:48:22.913 --> 00:48:24.414
Hold your fire!

439
00:48:25.249 --> 00:48:29.252
We surrender! We surrender!

440
00:48:32.506 --> 00:48:35.258
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.


441
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.804
I didn't want to be here. I swear.

442
00:48:39.972 --> 00:48:41.431
Calm down.

443
00:48:41.932 --> 00:48:45.393
-Please don't kill me, please.
-Calm down.


444
00:48:48.773 --> 00:48:50.523
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.

445
00:48:50.733 --> 00:48:52.442
-Listen, no one is going to hurt you.
-And I have a bad heart.


446
00:48:53.444 --> 00:48:56.780
Don't believe a word Major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.


447
00:48:56.906 --> 00:49:00.074
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.


448
00:49:00.451 --> 00:49:05.038
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.


449
00:49:06.165 --> 00:49:08.041
So what should we do with him?

450
00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:10.084
Kill him.

451
00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:13.838
Yes, kill him.

452
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.884
Put him on his side.

453
00:49:19.845 --> 00:49:22.889
-Did you give him a painkiller?
-Not yet.


454
00:49:24.391 --> 00:49:26.059
Give him some morphine.

455
00:49:27.102 --> 00:49:29.854
We have committed
ourselves to a struggle...


456
00:49:30.815 --> 00:49:34.192
...in which, whether we
like it or not, we may have to kill...


457
00:49:35.611 --> 00:49:40.323
...or be killed because we are
fighting for Bolivia's freedom.


458
00:49:42.326 --> 00:49:45.537
You can do it now.

459
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:56.089
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.


460
00:49:58.884 --> 00:50:01.553
We hope to see you soon.

461
00:50:02.847 --> 00:50:06.391
Because we could use more
of your ammunitions and weapons.


462
00:50:11.939 --> 00:50:13.690
Long live a free Bolivia!

463
00:50:13.941 --> 00:50:16.109
Long live
the National Liberation Army!


464
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:27.495
No one wanted to stay.

465
00:50:29.081 --> 00:50:30.456
That takes time.

466
00:51:58.379 --> 00:52:01.839
No, if you leave now
you could be arrested.


467
00:52:02.257 --> 00:52:06.094
I think you should wait
until we start our march northward.


468
00:52:06.512 --> 00:52:08.846
-You're going north?
-Yes.


469
00:52:10.099 --> 00:52:13.184
Then we can let you off
on the Cochabamba road.


470
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:17.689
No. I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.


471
00:52:17.898 --> 00:52:20.441
Ciro, we're at war.

472
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.320
Give me a guide.

473
00:52:24.613 --> 00:52:26.823
Give me a guide and I'll
make the arrangements.


474
00:52:27.241 --> 00:52:29.909
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.


475
00:52:31.203 --> 00:52:33.079
I'll think about an alternative.

476
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:37.250
But any move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.


477
00:52:48.137 --> 00:52:51.097
Ramón, your books are soaked.

478
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.808
Put them on
those rocks to dry.


479
00:52:58.939 --> 00:53:00.106
Arturo.

480
00:53:00.524 --> 00:53:02.942
Water got in the radio,
everything is rusted.


481
00:53:04.236 --> 00:53:06.654
What are you saying,
that it doesn't work?


482
00:53:07.031 --> 00:53:09.115
It still receives,
but it doesn't send.


483
00:53:14.371 --> 00:53:16.330
Shit. Now we're really screwed.

484
00:53:16.957 --> 00:53:21.878
Not quite, we still have
the visitors to relay messages.


485
00:53:26.383 --> 00:53:29.302
The army says that you are
here to practice Communism.


486
00:53:30.137 --> 00:53:33.139
That you have no God,
that you all work for the State.


487
00:53:34.058 --> 00:53:37.393
That you rape women and
destroy families.


488
00:53:38.312 --> 00:53:41.981
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and want to make us slaves.


489
00:53:42.983 --> 00:53:44.984
And what kind of freedom do you have?

490
00:53:45.319 --> 00:53:46.861
The kind where
I can do whatever I want.


491
00:53:47.279 --> 00:53:50.990
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.


492
00:53:51.492 --> 00:53:53.326
We haven't come to harm anybody.

493
00:53:53.827 --> 00:53:56.871
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.


494
00:53:57.164 --> 00:53:59.832
But I have nothing, only this.

495
00:54:02.586 --> 00:54:04.337
How much do you want for this?

496
00:54:05.422 --> 00:54:07.882
Whatever you have ― take it.

497
00:54:09.593 --> 00:54:13.221
I'll stay if you need me.

498
00:54:14.723 --> 00:54:18.726
What I need now are peasants.

499
00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:24.440
It's better if you go to France and
make a network to promote our cause...


500
00:54:25.192 --> 00:54:29.237
...so they can send us money,
medicine and radios.


501
00:54:31.698 --> 00:54:34.951
I'd also need you to take
some messages to Cuba.


502
00:54:36.995 --> 00:54:43.334
I'll write Sartre and Bertrand Russell
to organize a worldwide fund...


503
00:54:44.378 --> 00:54:46.754
...on behalf
of the Bolivian revolution.


504
00:54:59.017 --> 00:55:00.560
Don't worry.

505
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.396
We'll take you out
of here when you recover.


506
00:55:05.774 --> 00:55:07.942
I'm not worried.

507
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:17.451
Tumaini.

508
00:55:28.255 --> 00:55:29.714
Here, it's yours.

509
00:55:30.465 --> 00:55:32.049
To protect you.

510
00:55:42.394 --> 00:55:47.190
I'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.


511
00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:51.235
I want you to stay
with the sick until we come back.


512
00:55:51.862 --> 00:55:53.654
How long will you be gone?

513
00:55:54.198 --> 00:55:55.615
About three days.

514
00:56:36.156 --> 00:56:37.448
Rolando.

515
00:56:37.824 --> 00:56:40.493
Go with Loro to replace
Benigno and Miguel.


516
00:56:41.995 --> 00:56:43.329
Ramón.

517
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:45.373
There's no one in the house.

518
00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:48.501
So leave the money with a note.

519
00:57:14.528 --> 00:57:16.195
Pick up everything, we're leaving.

520
00:57:26.832 --> 00:57:27.707
Ramón.

521
00:57:31.295 --> 00:57:32.795
There's no sign of Loro.

522
00:57:41.221 --> 00:57:43.097
That's what they've given me, Captain.

523
00:57:44.016 --> 00:57:45.224
What good is this for?

524
00:57:45.976 --> 00:57:47.560
Are there any shops here?

525
00:57:49.313 --> 00:57:51.939
They took my pigs and my corn.

526
00:57:54.443 --> 00:57:57.737
You helped them
and they gave you money.


527
00:57:58.113 --> 00:58:01.574
Now you are going
to help us eliminate them, otherwise...


528
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:04.952
And now you are stealing
my chickens, Captain.


529
00:58:05.871 --> 00:58:09.081
Listen to me closely,
smart ass, really pay attention.


530
00:58:09.833 --> 00:58:14.420
Let me know immediately
if the guerrillas come back again.


531
00:58:15.088 --> 00:58:17.590
You have a good heart.

532
00:58:18.884 --> 00:58:20.426
You'll do it.

533
00:59:34.668 --> 00:59:35.960
Good morning.

534
00:59:37.629 --> 00:59:42.842
I'm just here to write an article on the
guerrilla movement in Bolivia.


535
00:59:43.844 --> 00:59:49.348
Trying to confirm
the Bolivian Army's rumours...


536
00:59:50.517 --> 00:59:53.686
...that Che Guevara
is the leader of the group...


537
00:59:55.021 --> 00:59:57.106
...and there is a woman with him.

538
00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:01.068
This guy is a Trojan horse.

539
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.073
I don't want
any Cubans talking to him.


540
01:00:12.372 --> 01:00:14.874
-What's up, Darío?
-Food is ready.


541
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.169
Start serving. 
Children first.

542
01:00:21.465 --> 01:00:23.007
Are you from Paraguay?

543
01:00:23.216 --> 01:00:26.886
Paraguay? No way, 
I'm from Oruro.

544
01:00:28.722 --> 01:00:30.097
Okay, kids.

545
01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:33.684
Once you are done you
have to leave, right?


546
01:00:34.102 --> 01:00:37.396
We can't leave because that
gringo owes us money.


547
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:39.982
How much does he owe you?

548
01:00:40.192 --> 01:00:41.734
50 pesos.

549
01:00:54.915 --> 01:00:57.291
I spoke with the Englishman
about the way out.


550
01:00:59.294 --> 01:01:01.921
He says the army knows him in Camiri.

551
01:01:04.424 --> 01:01:06.383
We could get out that way.

552
01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:10.429
You are the ones
to make that decision.


553
01:01:12.432 --> 01:01:15.935
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.


554
01:01:20.941 --> 01:01:24.860
Inti will take you
up the road to Camiri.


555
01:01:25.987 --> 01:01:28.155
Try not to go through Muyupampa.

556
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.158
Don't get yourselves captured.

557
01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.329
If that happens remember to
always deny my presence...


558
01:01:35.664 --> 01:01:39.750
...and the presence of all Cubans
here at each moment and at all costs.


559
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.672
-Do you have a cigarette?
-No, I don't.


560
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.757
Goddamn it!

561
01:01:47.133 --> 01:01:50.302
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.


562
01:01:50.637 --> 01:01:52.763
But I do have some tobacco.

563
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.266
Thanks, brother.

564
01:01:57.435 --> 01:01:58.644
Where are the Cubans?

565
01:01:58.812 --> 01:02:01.021
-Well, they should be...
-Darío, come here!


566
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:07.861
I told you not
to talk to that guy!

567
01:02:08.321 --> 01:02:09.363
What did he say?

568
01:02:09.573 --> 01:02:12.866
He didn't say anything, brother.
I asked him for a cigarette.


569
01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:14.660
You're going to the back.

570
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.409
Freeze! Stop right there!

571
01:02:55.535 --> 01:02:58.037
Drop your backpacks
and show us your papers, shitheads!


572
01:03:00.915 --> 01:03:02.041
Throw them on the ground.

573
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:05.878
The Frenchman's name is Regis Debray.

574
01:03:07.088 --> 01:03:10.257
Masquerades as a radical author,
a Marxist journalist.


575
01:03:11.051 --> 01:03:14.303
Spends a lot of time in Cuba,
and is a good friend of Fidel Castro.


576
01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:18.057
The Argentine's name is Ciro Bustos.

577
01:03:18.475 --> 01:03:19.975
A painter, and also a writer.

578
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:23.937
This character collected money in 1 963...

579
01:03:24.064 --> 01:03:27.733
...for a local guerrilla
movement led by Jorge Massetti.


580
01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:31.945
Massetti was killed
by the police in Argentina in 1 964.


581
01:04:02.143 --> 01:04:05.771
Two mercenaries, a Frenchman
and an Argentine were killed...


582
01:04:05.897 --> 01:04:09.566
...when confronted by the army in
the area known as Vaca Guzmán.


583
01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:12.236
The Guzmán region,
that's in Muyupampa.


584
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:18.992
If that's true, those bastards
are going to pay for it, big time.


585
01:04:28.753 --> 01:04:31.839
The three of them were arrested.
They were taken to Camiri.


586
01:04:31.965 --> 01:04:33.132
Who told you that?

587
01:04:33.258 --> 01:04:36.343
We stopped a van that
came from Muyupampa...


588
01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:40.806
...with a German priest and a man.
They gave all the information.


589
01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:45.602
They want to talk to the boss.
They gave us some sweets and stuff.


590
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:49.273
-Inti, have those people seen you?
-No.


591
01:05:00.952 --> 01:05:02.995
Many of your men are not Bolivian.

592
01:05:03.455 --> 01:05:06.039
That's why no one trusts you.

593
01:05:06.166 --> 01:05:07.833
But they trust you.

594
01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:11.962
They asked us to talk to you.

595
01:05:13.173 --> 01:05:16.759
Then tell them that our army is
open to anyone who wants to fight...


596
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:19.178
...they should be here with us.

597
01:05:19.345 --> 01:05:22.431
No, they reject everything that
has to do with violence.


598
01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:27.227
So, people in power can
use violence to oppress us...


599
01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:30.439
...but we can't
use it to free ourselves?


600
01:05:30.774 --> 01:05:33.400
They don't want to join you
and they don't want you here.


601
01:05:33.526 --> 01:05:36.528
You don't have
the right to ruin their lives.


602
01:05:43.828 --> 01:05:45.954
You are going to have peace
today in Muyupampa...


603
01:05:46.372 --> 01:05:49.875
...on the condition that you bring us
a truck of food and medical goods...


604
01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:51.960
...by 6 p.m. on this watch.

605
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:56.507
We'll meet at Nemesio's farm.
We'll pay for everything.


606
01:05:57.801 --> 01:06:00.177
Then we'll go; you have my word.

607
01:06:01.888 --> 01:06:02.971
Okay.

608
01:06:04.974 --> 01:06:06.433
Open your mouth.

609
01:06:26.287 --> 01:06:28.664
They will torture Bustos and Debray.

610
01:06:29.123 --> 01:06:30.999
They'll learn everything.

611
01:06:36.673 --> 01:06:37.840
Ramón.

612
01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:40.884
I think you should change your name.

613
01:06:43.429 --> 01:06:45.013
That's not a bad idea.

614
01:06:51.271 --> 01:06:52.312
Plane!

615
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.897
Get everyone out of the house.

616
01:06:54.107 --> 01:06:55.274
-Run!
-Cover yourselves!


617
01:06:56.943 --> 01:06:58.569
Quickly, under the tree!

618
01:06:58.736 --> 01:07:00.028
Get out of here!

619
01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:10.914
Most of these men are Cubans.
Don't be mistaken.


620
01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:16.628
This is an invasion
promoted by Castro.


621
01:07:19.924 --> 01:07:24.970
A Communist plot to remove a peaceful,
democratically elected government.


622
01:07:25.305 --> 01:07:28.056
President Barrientos,
what about the Americans?


623
01:07:28.266 --> 01:07:31.268
Are there U .S. military advisors?

624
01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:35.939
The United States has sent planes,
helicopters and nothing more.


625
01:07:36.274 --> 01:07:39.318
That's their response
to the guerrilla threat?


626
01:07:40.653 --> 01:07:45.574
Our military is entirely capable
of handling this situation.


627
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.578
The guerrilla forces
are on their last legs.


628
01:07:51.623 --> 01:07:53.707
Is Che Guevara leading this group?

629
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:58.962
I'll say it once.
Che Guevara is not in Bolivia.


630
01:08:13.311 --> 01:08:14.394
Fernando.

631
01:08:16.105 --> 01:08:18.607
The miners are threatening
to go on strike.


632
01:08:22.153 --> 01:08:23.320
Where?

633
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:25.155
In Catavi, Siglo XX.

634
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:27.991
The miners are going on strike!

635
01:08:56.854 --> 01:09:00.148
Miners have pledged 50 bolivianos
of their paychecks to our cause.


636
01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.945
For them, that's a fortune.

637
01:09:08.074 --> 01:09:10.742
Arturo,
report to Miguel at the ambush...


638
01:09:11.202 --> 01:09:12.869
...and replace Pablito.

639
01:09:15.206 --> 01:09:17.916
I'll go through all of Bolivia
without firing a single shot.


640
01:09:18.042 --> 01:09:19.167
Okay.

641
01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:23.964
Sir, the situation is slipping
through our fingers.


642
01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:26.717
The Pope and de Gaulle are
pressuring us about Debray.


643
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:30.971
Some members of your coalition are
expressing support for the strike...


644
01:09:31.222 --> 01:09:33.056
...and sympathy for the rebel cause.

645
01:09:33.391 --> 01:09:35.642
We need to
take control of this thing.


646
01:09:36.728 --> 01:09:38.603
What do you have in mind?

647
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:40.313
Tell people about Guevara.

648
01:09:40.606 --> 01:09:44.192
Declare a state of emergency and
crack down on the Siglo XX miners...


649
01:09:44.485 --> 01:09:45.777
...the iron fist.

650
01:09:46.195 --> 01:09:49.656
Seal the borders and declare
a national state of war.


651
01:09:50.783 --> 01:09:52.034
And the rebels?

652
01:09:52.702 --> 01:09:55.078
Your main problem,
Mr. President, is the lack...


653
01:09:55.246 --> 01:09:57.539
...of coordination
among your deployed forces.


654
01:09:58.207 --> 01:10:00.125
I couldn't agree more, sir.

655
01:10:02.003 --> 01:10:03.253
What do you suggest?

656
01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:05.922
Divide the region in three zones.

657
01:10:06.132 --> 01:10:09.301
Surround each zone,
cut off its source of supply...


658
01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:12.220
...and liquidate any guerrilla forces.

659
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:19.269
A few minutes ago,
Radio Argentina reported...


660
01:10:19.645 --> 01:10:22.481
...the sad news about
the Siglo XX massacre...


661
01:10:22.732 --> 01:10:26.109
...which resulted in the deaths
of 87 miners.


662
01:10:26.819 --> 01:10:29.863
The families and fellow miners
mourn their loss.


663
01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:33.075
What are they saying
on Bolivian stations?


664
01:10:34.077 --> 01:10:35.327
The same.

665
01:10:35.953 --> 01:10:39.289
They confirm the battle in the mines,
but they are silent about the death toll.


666
01:10:56.933 --> 01:10:58.350
They hit Pombo.

667
01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:01.770
They almost got us, man.

668
01:11:21.624 --> 01:11:22.874
Pour me some water.

669
01:11:36.013 --> 01:11:37.889
Come on, breathe.

670
01:11:56.117 --> 01:11:57.367
The worst is over.

671
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.188
He asked that you hold his watch
until you can give it to his son.


672
01:12:39.243 --> 01:12:40.368
Joaquín.

673
01:12:41.287 --> 01:12:43.413
We can't circle it forever.

674
01:12:43.789 --> 01:12:45.665
This place is crawling with troops.

675
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:50.879
Ramón told us
not to move out of the area.


676
01:12:51.255 --> 01:12:54.424
That was before
the army overran our camp.


677
01:12:55.259 --> 01:12:57.928
We have no food left ― nothing.

678
01:12:58.095 --> 01:13:00.430
If Ramón were
coming back, he'd be here by now.


679
01:13:01.807 --> 01:13:03.808
If we leave,
how are we going to meet him?


680
01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:07.270
If Ramón is not here it's
because the army is preventing him.


681
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.067
I say we find
our way to the Rio Grande.


682
01:13:12.985 --> 01:13:16.613
We've got as much chance finding
Ramón across the river...


683
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.115
...as we do here.

684
01:13:37.468 --> 01:13:38.843
Good morning, miss.

685
01:13:39.303 --> 01:13:41.137
Can you sell me a can of milk?

686
01:13:43.307 --> 01:13:45.016
Ricardo, what's up?

687
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.478
-Shut up and give me your canteen.
-Moron!


688
01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.036
Breathe! Now hold it.

689
01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:06.830
-Fuck!
-Calm down.


690
01:14:06.998 --> 01:14:08.248
Hold it!

691
01:14:26.726 --> 01:14:27.767
Breathe.

692
01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:49.497
How long are we going to
look for these people?


693
01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:52.208
Until we find them.

694
01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:56.546
I agree, but I think
we're moving away from them.


695
01:14:57.173 --> 01:14:59.716
We should try to make contact
with the capital again.


696
01:15:00.593 --> 01:15:02.344
We're at an impasse.

697
01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:05.722
How many more of us have to die
to find the other group?


698
01:15:06.557 --> 01:15:10.894
Chapaco, if you were lost,
we'd do the same thing.


699
01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:15.732
No one abandons anyone in the group.

700
01:15:16.734 --> 01:15:18.109
Is that clear?

701
01:15:20.571 --> 01:15:21.571
Let's go.

702
01:16:13.624 --> 01:16:15.166
Excuse me, Fernando...

703
01:16:17.962 --> 01:16:19.879
...but the men are starving...

704
01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:22.632
...and we have nothing to give them.

705
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.470
We also have nothing for the animals.
They're eating the bark off the trees.


706
01:16:28.222 --> 01:16:30.098
-What do you want me to do?
-Kill a horse.


707
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:40.108
I'm giving you another shot.

708
01:17:12.016 --> 01:17:13.933
Fernando, with your permission.

709
01:17:19.356 --> 01:17:21.691
I think I could...

710
01:17:22.526 --> 01:17:25.778
...make it back to the camp
to look for your medicines.


711
01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.157
What do you want?

712
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:32.285
Do you want me
to divide the group again?


713
01:17:33.204 --> 01:17:34.704
I'm not doing it.

714
01:17:34.997 --> 01:17:39.250
And even less, risk anyone's life...

715
01:17:40.294 --> 01:17:42.337
...for the sake of my own well-being.

716
01:18:44.942 --> 01:18:48.736
We are in a difficult situation.

717
01:18:49.446 --> 01:18:51.823
The truth is, all of us...

718
01:18:52.783 --> 01:18:54.450
...have made mistakes.

719
01:18:55.452 --> 01:18:57.036
But I made the worst mistake...

720
01:18:57.871 --> 01:19:00.832
...when I didn't
bring my medicines along.


721
01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:05.128
This struggle gives us...

722
01:19:06.463 --> 01:19:08.631
...the opportunity to become...

723
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:12.302
...true revolutionaries,
the highest level...


724
01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:14.596
...of humanity.

725
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.266
To become men...

726
01:19:18.976 --> 01:19:22.812
...in the purest sense of the word.

727
01:19:25.357 --> 01:19:27.442
Too old to learn.

728
01:19:28.902 --> 01:19:31.070
If the wheel rolls downhill...

729
01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:33.656
...let it go.

730
01:19:52.426 --> 01:19:54.010
Come on, let's go up.

731
01:19:57.806 --> 01:19:59.140
Let's go!

732
01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:08.441
-Let's go!
-No, I can hold them!


733
01:20:08.984 --> 01:20:10.276
Go!

734
01:20:15.449 --> 01:20:17.116
You bastards!

735
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:26.459
They're reporting three hours
of intense combat in Monteagudo...


736
01:20:27.044 --> 01:20:29.837
...between a group of guerrillas
and the 3rd division.


737
01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:35.051
The army didn't
suffer any casualties.


738
01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:36.969
Here's Monteagudo.

739
01:20:38.889 --> 01:20:40.890
They are talking
about one dead guerrilla...


740
01:20:41.225 --> 01:20:42.684
...named Antonio Fernández from Tarata.

741
01:20:43.018 --> 01:20:45.603
Pombo, sounds like it was Pedro.

742
01:20:46.063 --> 01:20:47.522
He's from Tarata.

743
01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:50.483
Monteagudo is here.

744
01:20:52.194 --> 01:20:55.530
-Where exactly?~
-Here, south of Nancahuazú.


745
01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:08.126
This is where Joaquín
and his group are operating.


746
01:21:10.421 --> 01:21:13.047
-So, what we're hearing makes sense.
-We're not far off.


747
01:21:18.095 --> 01:21:19.846
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Good afternoon.


748
01:21:20.556 --> 01:21:22.849
With your permission,
I need to check your house.


749
01:21:24.309 --> 01:21:25.935
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.


750
01:21:28.272 --> 01:21:29.897
Hello, madam.

751
01:21:31.233 --> 01:21:32.442
Good afternoon.

752
01:21:39.992 --> 01:21:42.243
Don't worry, madam,
we won't do you any harm.


753
01:21:43.954 --> 01:21:45.371
Who's that man over there?

754
01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:48.875
-Sit down.
-No, thanks.


755
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:52.587
-Who is that man?
-Oh, he's a friend...


756
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.130
Is he all right?

757
01:21:54.256 --> 01:21:56.007
Have you seen the army around here?

758
01:21:57.176 --> 01:21:59.552
He's a neighbour. 
He has a fever.

759
01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.889
We have a doctor with us.

760
01:22:03.682 --> 01:22:07.018
We'll bring him to see you
when we come back.


761
01:22:08.187 --> 01:22:09.228
Do you understand me?

762
01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:11.147
...but what about the army?

763
01:22:13.609 --> 01:22:16.277
We need to find a way
across the river, a ford.


764
01:22:16.528 --> 01:22:19.155
You live here and you know
this area well. You can help us.


765
01:22:23.535 --> 01:22:25.244
Get us some food.

766
01:22:25.788 --> 01:22:27.330
There, have some money.

767
01:22:27.623 --> 01:22:30.583
You are seven people, right?
And eight with the woman.


768
01:22:32.377 --> 01:22:34.003
How do you know that we're seven?

769
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:39.133
I'm slowing everyone down.
I don't know if I'll be able to go on.


770
01:22:39.968 --> 01:22:41.761
Of course you can, Tania.

771
01:22:43.222 --> 01:22:44.806
We'll be back in two days.

772
01:22:49.019 --> 01:22:53.189
Remember, sir, find us an easy place
to cross the river.


773
01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:55.001
Pombo, I've got to talk to Fernando.

774
01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.086
Fernando is sleeping.

775
01:23:57.337 --> 01:23:58.671
He's recovering
from an asthma attack.


776
01:23:58.839 --> 01:24:01.424
Don't you think
he's had enough worries for today?


777
01:24:01.884 --> 01:24:03.092
Let him rest.

778
01:24:03.343 --> 01:24:05.803
Inti, what's the matter?

779
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:08.139
Okay, go and tell him.

780
01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:16.898
I think you should speak to
Camba and Chapaco.


781
01:24:17.608 --> 01:24:20.526
Camba says his physical condition
prevents him from continuing.


782
01:24:22.279 --> 01:24:24.739
I think he no longer
sees the point of the struggle.


783
01:24:27.159 --> 01:24:28.451
I talked to Inti already.

784
01:24:30.287 --> 01:24:34.123
Fernando, I am a bit sick.

785
01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.751
-I don't believe...
-Camba.


786
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.589
I can't let you go
until we meet Joaquín's group...


787
01:24:42.925 --> 01:24:44.592
...because if they capture you...

788
01:24:45.385 --> 01:24:47.345
...you not only risk your own life...

789
01:24:47.763 --> 01:24:51.307
...but you also put
the whole group at risk.

790
01:24:53.769 --> 01:24:55.269
Look, Camba.

791
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:58.397
To survive here, to win...

792
01:24:59.399 --> 01:25:01.984
...you have to live
as if you've already died.


793
01:25:11.161 --> 01:25:13.454
I never said to Inti
that I wanted to quit.


794
01:25:15.248 --> 01:25:17.083
Quitting is for cowards.

795
01:25:19.294 --> 01:25:23.506
What I told Inti is that in six months
to a year, I want to return home.


796
01:25:36.103 --> 01:25:37.436
Let's see.

797
01:25:39.272 --> 01:25:40.481
Tell me...

798
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:45.778
...exactly where you said to cross.

799
01:25:47.614 --> 01:25:50.950
Just about here is where
I will make them cross, captain.


800
01:25:59.126 --> 01:26:00.584
Now...

801
01:26:02.129 --> 01:26:05.965
...put this white shirt on
so we don't shoot at you.


802
01:26:08.051 --> 01:26:10.720
Now go home and don't move...

803
01:26:11.513 --> 01:26:15.474
...until the guerrillas arrive,
or they'll suspect something.


804
01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:08.295
Fire!

805
01:28:15.637 --> 01:28:21.433
Today, the Bolivian Army reported
a rebel clash at Vado del Yeso.


806
01:28:21.935 --> 01:28:24.979
Ten rebels were reported killed.

807
01:28:25.313 --> 01:28:29.984
The group's one survivor, José Carrillo,
is a local miner who was under...


808
01:28:30.235 --> 01:28:33.154
...the command of a Cuban
named Joaquín Acuña.


809
01:28:33.613 --> 01:28:35.614
That's bullshit from the army.

810
01:28:35.949 --> 01:28:37.783
They can't all be dead...

811
01:28:38.535 --> 01:28:40.744
...unless they were
walking in their sleep.


812
01:28:41.746 --> 01:28:43.372
José Carrillo is Paco.

813
01:28:43.832 --> 01:28:45.833
Maybe he was caught and is talking.

814
01:28:48.587 --> 01:28:49.628
Let's go.

815
01:28:51.173 --> 01:28:52.423
It's already five o'clock.

816
01:29:13.403 --> 01:29:16.363
-What happened to her face?
-The piranhas ate it.


817
01:29:18.533 --> 01:29:21.577
I requested a coffin.
There's a cemetery in town.


818
01:29:21.995 --> 01:29:24.038
Mr. President,
with your permission, sir.


819
01:29:24.497 --> 01:29:26.874
What do you plan to do
with Che if he is captured alive?


820
01:29:29.544 --> 01:29:30.961
Personally, I think...

821
01:29:31.796 --> 01:29:33.881
...the biggest mistake Batista made...

822
01:29:34.424 --> 01:29:36.884
...was not killing Fidel
when he had the chance.


823
01:30:40.115 --> 01:30:41.615
Thanks.

824
01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:49.498
Fernando, they say the truck comes
every day, and the deputy...


825
01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:51.917
-What's his name?
-Vidal Aguilar...


826
01:30:52.127 --> 01:30:55.296
...left yesterday for Vallegrande
to warn the army about us.


827
01:30:55.755 --> 01:30:59.133
It's a two-day-old telegram
sent by the army to the deputy.


828
01:30:59.592 --> 01:31:02.469
It says:
"Any expenses incurred will be...


829
01:31:02.971 --> 01:31:05.389
...reimbursed by the army."

830
01:31:06.474 --> 01:31:09.184
Inti is already talking to the wife.
They own a store.


831
01:31:09.644 --> 01:31:11.937
Tell Inti that in reprisal for that...

832
01:31:12.063 --> 01:31:14.481
...we will take all that
we need from the store.


833
01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:18.485
Take 1 0 cans of sardines
and those tomatoes.


834
01:31:21.364 --> 01:31:23.741
This is for my children!

835
01:31:24.159 --> 01:31:25.993
Madam, madam.

836
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:32.333
Dear comrades, we've been here
fighting the army for six months now.


837
01:31:32.584 --> 01:31:34.168
You may wonder why.

838
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:38.714
We want to
end injustice in this country.


839
01:31:39.549 --> 01:31:42.593
To end neglect and misery...

840
01:31:42.844 --> 01:31:45.596
...to which the government subjects
its own people.


841
01:31:46.848 --> 01:31:49.850
For example,
where is the nearest hospital?


842
01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.396
About 1 00 kilometres away,
right? What if you get sick?


843
01:31:54.731 --> 01:31:57.649
First you have to pay
to take a truck to Vallegrande...


844
01:31:57.984 --> 01:31:59.568
...and then you pay for the stay.

845
01:31:59.694 --> 01:32:02.654
So you go to a hospital,
which they say is public...


846
01:32:02.947 --> 01:32:05.657
...but to see a doctor,
you must pay first.


847
01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:07.868
lsn't this the way it is?

848
01:32:08.703 --> 01:32:12.873
And the medicine? They won't even
give you aspirin for free.


849
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.209
ln other words...

850
01:32:15.585 --> 01:32:20.214
...if your kid gets sick or dies because
you have no money for the hospital...


851
01:32:21.132 --> 01:32:23.008
...who is going to care?

852
01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.220
That is the reason why your
luck changing for the better...


853
01:32:26.721 --> 01:32:29.973
...depends on the triumph
of our struggle...


854
01:32:31.768 --> 01:32:32.810
Yes?

855
01:32:33.061 --> 01:32:35.396
Is there going
to be fighting here in the village?


856
01:32:38.233 --> 01:32:42.486
We have no intention of
fighting in the villages.


857
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:29.450
Nothing.

858
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.077
Two pigs and a mule.

859
01:33:32.912 --> 01:33:35.080
-Weird, isn't it?
-You're telling me.


860
01:33:35.623 --> 01:33:38.542
-Where is Miguel?
-He should already be here.


861
01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:43.088
Hey.

862
01:33:43.923 --> 01:33:45.966
Madam, madam!

863
01:33:47.635 --> 01:33:48.802
Madam!

864
01:33:55.477 --> 01:33:57.144
I don't see anything.

865
01:33:58.021 --> 01:33:59.480
Absolute silence.

866
01:34:00.857 --> 01:34:03.734
Smells like soldiers to me.

867
01:34:04.819 --> 01:34:06.862
It's completely deserted.

868
01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:11.909
I talked to an old woman who said
that her grandson saw soldiers yesterday.


869
01:34:15.079 --> 01:34:16.163
Miguel.

870
01:34:17.582 --> 01:34:21.668
Get the vanguard ready to go
to Jagüey at 1 300 hours.


871
01:34:22.003 --> 01:34:24.338
You heard it.
The vanguard, get ready.


872
01:34:24.506 --> 01:34:27.174
Miguel, stay on guard.

873
01:34:28.134 --> 01:34:30.093
Take all security measures.

874
01:34:31.513 --> 01:34:32.554
Understood.

875
01:34:39.896 --> 01:34:41.688
-Tell me.
-Fernando...


876
01:34:42.148 --> 01:34:44.149
I think it's better that I stay here.

877
01:34:44.359 --> 01:34:46.818
I can't stand up or pee.

878
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:50.948
We aren't going to leave you here.

879
01:34:52.825 --> 01:34:56.870
When we get to Jagüey,
we'll make a decision.


880
01:35:12.804 --> 01:35:14.012
Good afternoon.

881
01:35:14.305 --> 01:35:15.931
I met him on the way to Jagüey.

882
01:35:16.391 --> 01:35:18.225
He says he comes from Vallegrande.

883
01:35:20.979 --> 01:35:22.729
Where are you going with these goods?

884
01:35:23.064 --> 01:35:27.234
To Picacho, sir.
I have jerky and cheese to sell to...


885
01:35:27.402 --> 01:35:28.735
Pombo, Pombo.

886
01:35:29.404 --> 01:35:30.529
...support my family, sir.

887
01:35:30.738 --> 01:35:34.616
-Have you seen the army around?
-No, sir. I haven't seen the army.


888
01:35:35.410 --> 01:35:37.411
Fernando,
he looks too nervous to me.


889
01:35:37.745 --> 01:35:39.580
Maintain vigilance.

890
01:35:40.623 --> 01:35:43.208
Fall into line. 
Everyone, stay alert.

891
01:35:46.963 --> 01:35:49.756
Are you sure
you haven't seen the army?


892
01:35:50.258 --> 01:35:52.217
No, sir. I haven't seen the army.

893
01:35:53.011 --> 01:35:54.011
Good.

894
01:35:55.096 --> 01:35:57.472
Pombo, walk with him
to the outskirts of the village.


895
01:35:57.932 --> 01:35:59.224
Thank you, sir.

896
01:36:10.153 --> 01:36:12.446
You have
a pebble factory in your shoe.


897
01:36:12.655 --> 01:36:14.364
It's the second time
you've stopped for the same shit.


898
01:36:21.039 --> 01:36:24.249
Pacho, that way.
Darío, go over there.


899
01:36:26.461 --> 01:36:27.628
Willy, go with them.

900
01:36:30.882 --> 01:36:32.299
-Antonio.
-Chapaco, let's go.


901
01:36:32.634 --> 01:36:35.135
Urbano, go over by the fence.

902
01:36:38.473 --> 01:36:40.140
Arturo, over there.

903
01:36:40.975 --> 01:36:42.392
Keep going, Darío.

904
01:36:43.895 --> 01:36:46.313
Retreat!
Everybody run down the hill!


905
01:36:50.443 --> 01:36:53.070
I'm covering you!
Downhill, everyone!


906
01:36:53.696 --> 01:36:56.657
-Chino, what's wrong?
-I lost my glasses!


907
01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.618
They'll kill you. 
Here they are!

908
01:36:59.952 --> 01:37:02.162
They killed Coco, 
Julio and Miguel.

909
01:37:03.748 --> 01:37:05.832
Camba, this way. Camba!

910
01:37:07.335 --> 01:37:10.170
Camba! What are you doing?

911
01:37:12.507 --> 01:37:13.674
Come on!

912
01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:34.027
What happened?

913
01:37:37.573 --> 01:37:39.866
They killed Miguel,
Julio, and your brother.


914
01:37:44.539 --> 01:37:46.248
I tried to get them out...

915
01:37:47.542 --> 01:37:48.917
...but I couldn't.

916
01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:57.217
I'm sorry.

917
01:38:14.485 --> 01:38:16.194
This is Che's vanguard.

918
01:38:17.029 --> 01:38:18.405
You think he's close?

919
01:38:19.157 --> 01:38:21.700
I think you should bring in the
second Ranger division.


920
01:38:22.744 --> 01:38:24.578
They haven't finished training.

921
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.081
You're going to need
every man you can get.


922
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.949
Benigno.

923
01:39:04.452 --> 01:39:07.788
Benigno,
Fernando is asking you to stop.


924
01:39:11.834 --> 01:39:13.293
Hold on.

925
01:39:30.478 --> 01:39:34.314
Benigno, let me see your wound.

926
01:39:34.982 --> 01:39:37.692
It's okay. It's nothing.

927
01:39:41.656 --> 01:39:42.989
Take it.

928
01:39:45.993 --> 01:39:47.410
Tell me, Fernando.

929
01:39:49.664 --> 01:39:52.249
Go with Benigno to explore.

930
01:39:52.834 --> 01:39:57.504
Let's see if we can find a place
to spend the day without being seen.


931
01:40:01.926 --> 01:40:04.344
Captain,
a message from Lieutenant Huerta.


932
01:40:04.637 --> 01:40:07.514
A peasant saw some rebels
heading toward Yuro Ravine.


933
01:40:08.599 --> 01:40:10.392
Tell him we're on our way.

934
01:40:20.528 --> 01:40:21.528
Look.

935
01:40:26.617 --> 01:40:29.494
Must be a peasant
on his way to Pucará.


936
01:41:33.768 --> 01:41:36.436
-How many are there?
-More than a battalion.


937
01:41:36.687 --> 01:41:40.023
-Are they together?
-Two or three meters from each other.


938
01:41:40.358 --> 01:41:43.318
Willy, go look for Ñato
and Urbano, immediately.


939
01:41:43.945 --> 01:41:46.112
Arturo, bring Darío and Aniceto.

940
01:41:47.949 --> 01:41:51.952
Fernando,
the left ravine ends in a house...


941
01:41:52.328 --> 01:41:53.787
...that's taken by the army.

942
01:41:54.956 --> 01:41:58.166
-You can't get out of the middle one.
-This is the steepest ravine.


943
01:41:58.709 --> 01:42:01.294
It's 500 meters to the hill.

944
01:42:01.504 --> 01:42:05.966
And there's also a tree I think
would be good as a lookout.


945
01:42:06.175 --> 01:42:07.968
-Then, go there immediately.
-Okay.


946
01:42:08.135 --> 01:42:12.597
Benigno, be vigilant, find a place
where we can leave during the night.


947
01:42:13.057 --> 01:42:14.140
Okay.

948
01:42:14.392 --> 01:42:15.475
Take care.

949
01:42:17.812 --> 01:42:19.938
We'll wait there until nine at night.

950
01:42:20.982 --> 01:42:22.565
Those who don't arrive by then...

951
01:42:22.817 --> 01:42:26.403
...should make their way down
the ravine to Rio Grande...


952
01:42:27.822 --> 01:42:30.657
...and from there
to the mouth of Santa Elena.


953
01:42:30.992 --> 01:42:32.867
We'll wait there for two days.

954
01:42:34.537 --> 01:42:36.579
Pacho and Willy.

955
01:42:37.164 --> 01:42:39.249
You will take this position here.

956
01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:41.501
Antonio...

957
01:42:42.628 --> 01:42:43.837
...and Arturo...

958
01:42:45.423 --> 01:42:47.007
...into this ravine.

959
01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:50.677
No one shoots until they shoot.

960
01:42:51.387 --> 01:42:52.846
If you hear gunfire...

961
01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.682
...first, find out for sure that
they know about you...


962
01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:58.184
...and that they're not just
sweeping the area.


963
01:42:58.394 --> 01:43:00.687
Do you understand? Go now.

964
01:43:06.193 --> 01:43:09.279
Go with Darío
and reinforce Benigno's position.


965
01:43:09.655 --> 01:43:12.615
Don't let him
fall asleep from exhaustion.


966
01:43:18.873 --> 01:43:19.914
Fernando.

967
01:43:22.543 --> 01:43:25.045
We've been in
worse situations than this.


968
01:43:29.258 --> 01:43:32.886
There are three ravines:
La Tusca, San Antonio and Yuro.


969
01:43:33.512 --> 01:43:36.723
The guerrillas
could be in any one of them.


970
01:43:36.849 --> 01:43:38.391
Search all three.

971
01:43:38.809 --> 01:43:41.019
Start in the upper canyons
and make your way down.


972
01:43:41.228 --> 01:43:42.645
What if they try to escape?

973
01:43:43.272 --> 01:43:46.107
I'll set up a command post
where the three ravines meet.


974
01:45:52.359 --> 01:45:53.526
Ñato.

975
01:45:55.738 --> 01:45:56.863
Get Aniceto.

976
01:46:05.706 --> 01:46:08.708
Go with Ñato and take over
for Pombo and Urbano.


977
01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.377
Make them both come back.

978
01:46:12.713 --> 01:46:14.214
Wait a moment.

979
01:47:39.842 --> 01:47:41.175
What's that?

980
01:47:44.596 --> 01:47:46.264
Hey, Urbano.

981
01:47:46.974 --> 01:47:49.142
Ñato is making
signs I don't understand.


982
01:47:49.476 --> 01:47:52.854
Either he's saying Fernando wants us
to retreat or move toward him.


983
01:48:14.168 --> 01:48:17.003
-Antonio, do we move?
-No, we stay here.


984
01:48:26.305 --> 01:48:29.182
Pablito,
prepare the wounded to leave.


985
01:48:31.185 --> 01:48:32.560
Go now.

986
01:49:40.462 --> 01:49:42.588
Fuck! We have to leave now, Urbano.

987
01:49:42.798 --> 01:49:45.091
Pombo, go now! 
I can cover you!

988
01:49:45.801 --> 01:49:47.260
Wait, wait, wait!

989
01:49:49.054 --> 01:49:50.680
Wait! Now move!

990
01:50:05.946 --> 01:50:08.948
There they are.
Pombo and Urbano are there.


991
01:52:43.604 --> 01:52:44.895
How do you feel?

992
01:52:46.773 --> 01:52:48.107
Fine.

993
01:52:49.234 --> 01:52:51.277
The lieutenant bandaged it for me.

994
01:52:54.865 --> 01:52:56.866
Where have you taken Willy and Chino?

995
01:52:57.909 --> 01:52:59.368
They're next door.

996
01:53:01.288 --> 01:53:03.372
How many guerrillas are left out there?

997
01:53:04.666 --> 01:53:05.875
I don't know.

998
01:53:07.836 --> 01:53:09.795
What was your rendezvous point?

999
01:53:11.214 --> 01:53:12.632
We didn't have one.

1000
01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:15.426
What's your rendezvous point?

1001
01:53:15.636 --> 01:53:18.721
-I told you we didn't have one.
-You didn't have one?


1002
01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.725
Why did you come here
to La Higuera during the day?


1003
01:53:22.934 --> 01:53:25.436
Does it matter?
Nothing matters anymore.


1004
01:53:25.646 --> 01:53:26.896
Listen to me.

1005
01:53:28.273 --> 01:53:29.940
You are no longer in Cuba, sir.

1006
01:53:31.318 --> 01:53:34.445
And you should know that
I am a colonel in the Bolivian army.


1007
01:53:35.322 --> 01:53:38.866
You escaped the Congo, Venezuela,
but I assure you, not Bolivia.


1008
01:53:40.243 --> 01:53:44.080
This is where your adventures end,
you foreign piece of shit.


1009
01:53:44.915 --> 01:53:46.874
Alright. Get some rest.

1010
01:53:47.459 --> 01:53:50.961
Tomorrow we'll go to Vallegrande
to have your wound examined.


1011
01:53:57.344 --> 01:53:59.136
Put on your best face.

1012
01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:02.306
A lot of people
will want a photograph of you.


1013
01:54:04.851 --> 01:54:06.519
Maybe we should shave you.

1014
01:54:16.279 --> 01:54:17.530
Piece of shit!

1015
01:54:23.328 --> 01:54:25.996
Bring me the dead,
and leave them here, quickly!


1016
01:55:32.272 --> 01:55:33.439
That's not right.

1017
01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:36.358
They shouldn't do that with the dead.

1018
01:55:43.617 --> 01:55:45.284
Do you want to smoke?

1019
01:55:46.578 --> 01:55:47.661
Yes.

1020
01:55:54.044 --> 01:55:55.336
Thanks.

1021
01:55:59.341 --> 01:56:00.633
How is Cuba?

1022
01:56:03.136 --> 01:56:05.054
Cuba is progressing.

1023
01:56:06.598 --> 01:56:08.474
Do they have religion there?

1024
01:56:10.227 --> 01:56:13.020
Yes, there are religions.

1025
01:56:14.105 --> 01:56:16.690
I thought Communists
didn't believe in God.


1026
01:56:18.068 --> 01:56:19.193
Well...

1027
01:56:20.403 --> 01:56:22.279
...in Cuba
there's no official religion...


1028
01:56:23.114 --> 01:56:24.698
...but many people believe in God.

1029
01:56:27.202 --> 01:56:28.285
You don't believe in anything?

1030
01:56:28.745 --> 01:56:31.831
Yes, I believe in mankind.

1031
01:56:38.547 --> 01:56:40.714
-Are you married?
-No, no.


1032
01:56:41.508 --> 01:56:43.968
-How about you?
-Yes.


1033
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:46.136
Do you have children?

1034
01:56:46.388 --> 01:56:48.055
-I have five.
-Five!


1035
01:56:49.766 --> 01:56:51.600
Three girls and two boys.

1036
01:56:55.564 --> 01:56:56.981
You want some more?

1037
01:56:58.066 --> 01:56:59.066
Yes.

1038
01:57:07.951 --> 01:57:09.535
What's your name?

1039
01:57:09.619 --> 01:57:11.161
Eduardo.

1040
01:57:18.044 --> 01:57:19.795
Would you untie me, Eduardo?

1041
01:57:51.369 --> 01:57:52.578
Hey.

1042
01:57:53.121 --> 01:57:55.789
-Che asked me to free him.
-What?


1043
01:57:56.583 --> 01:57:58.125
He asked me to untie him.

1044
01:57:58.376 --> 01:58:00.461
No, you're crazy.
They'd kill both of us.


1045
01:58:03.465 --> 01:58:05.132
I don't want to go back in.

1046
01:58:05.675 --> 01:58:07.343
You take the next shift.

1047
01:58:50.053 --> 01:58:51.720
What are you thinking about,
Comandante?


1048
01:58:53.431 --> 01:58:55.057
Where are you from?

1049
01:58:55.725 --> 01:58:57.017
From Cuba.

1050
01:58:58.895 --> 01:59:00.729
I don't talk to traitors.

1051
01:59:02.649 --> 01:59:04.483
Okay, so you don't
want to talk to traitors.


1052
01:59:05.402 --> 01:59:07.361
But listen to what I have to say.

1053
01:59:08.405 --> 01:59:10.364
You executed my uncle.

1054
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.536
Must be hard, Comandante?

1055
01:59:16.246 --> 01:59:17.871
You, here, in the jungle...

1056
01:59:18.665 --> 01:59:21.542
...and Fidel in Havana
having lunch at El Nacional.


1057
01:59:23.878 --> 01:59:25.671
Can you imagine?

1058
01:59:53.867 --> 01:59:57.494
What made you think the Bolivians
would be receptive to your ideas?


1059
01:59:58.496 --> 02:00:00.622
We already had our revolution.

1060
02:00:01.583 --> 02:00:04.084
Didn't you hear
about the land reform in 1 952?


1061
02:00:04.252 --> 02:00:09.089
Yes, and Barrientos sold out.
Now you have a military dictatorship.


1062
02:00:09.924 --> 02:00:12.301
Have you seen how your peasants live?

1063
02:00:13.636 --> 02:00:16.096
If the peasants are so bad off...

1064
02:00:16.765 --> 02:00:18.390
...why did they turn you in?

1065
02:00:19.517 --> 02:00:21.602
Maybe they believed your lies.

1066
02:00:25.774 --> 02:00:27.941
Or maybe, they never wanted you here.

1067
02:00:28.610 --> 02:00:30.444
Yes, maybe...

1068
02:00:32.072 --> 02:00:34.698
...or maybe
our failure will wake them up.


1069
02:01:03.978 --> 02:01:05.020
Captain.

1070
02:01:05.146 --> 02:01:07.106
-Tell me.
-A call for Colonel Zenteno.


1071
02:01:07.232 --> 02:01:11.401
I told them he had left, but they
asked for the senior officer.


1072
02:01:14.739 --> 02:01:15.989
Bravo Uno.

1073
02:01:18.118 --> 02:01:19.827
This is Captain Ramírez.

1074
02:01:22.497 --> 02:01:23.914
Repeat, please.

1075
02:01:26.167 --> 02:01:29.461
Order 600. I will tell the colonel.

1076
02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.687
Put him there.

1077
02:01:49.023 --> 02:01:51.608
Take a picture.
You just have to press here.


1078
02:01:55.738 --> 02:01:57.573
So that you can smoke, Comandante.

1079
02:02:00.785 --> 02:02:02.452
Say cheese.

1080
02:02:09.711 --> 02:02:10.961
Stop there.

1081
02:02:18.386 --> 02:02:22.431
I have a message for you from
the high command. They ordered a 600.


1082
02:02:23.933 --> 02:02:25.934
Fine.
I have to leave for Vallegrande.


1083
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:30.272
I'll send a helicopter back at 1 400 hours.
Have the body ready.


1084
02:02:31.858 --> 02:02:33.192
Yes, sir.

1085
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:35.235
Let's go.

1086
02:02:37.906 --> 02:02:40.324
You can shoot from here down.
Nothing more.


1087
02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:42.117
Listen to me closely.

1088
02:02:42.827 --> 02:02:44.828
I need two volunteers.

1089
02:02:50.710 --> 02:02:52.211
Someone else?

1090
02:02:58.259 --> 02:03:00.219
Sergeant. Let me do it.

1091
02:03:02.263 --> 02:03:04.139
Shoot him below the neck.

1092
02:03:05.433 --> 02:03:06.683
Come.

1093
02:03:19.656 --> 02:03:20.656
Come with me.

1094
02:03:32.377 --> 02:03:33.919
Sit down!

1095
02:03:36.965 --> 02:03:39.800
Shoot. Do it.
