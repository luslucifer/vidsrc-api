2
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.630
Allende, the people support you!

3
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.470
When I was a young filmmaker,

4
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.270
I was lucky that Chris Marker
came to Chile.


5
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.110
He liked my first film,
"The First Year",


6
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.230
about Salvador Allende's
first months in power.


7
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.630
He took it to France and organized
its release in movie theaters there.


8
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.630
We exchanged many letters.

9
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.190
It was as if I were doing
a correspondence course in film.


10
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.310
I was thrilled.

11
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.070
Later on, when we were making
The "Battle of Chile",


12
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.430
he gave me some advice
that I remember well:


13
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.150
"When you want to film a fire,

14
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.270
"you must be ready at the place
where the first flame will appear."


15
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.230
MY IMAGINARY COUNTRY

16
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.550
On October 18, 2019,

17
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.910
a social outburst set Chile on fire.

18
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.150
This time, I wasn't able
to film the first flame.

19
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.510
One year later,

20
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.550
when I arrived with my camera,
I was reunited with my old friends


21
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.750
the stones of the Cordillera.

22
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.030
They are scattered around,

23
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.510
there are many of them.

24
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.790
As if it had been raining stones.

25
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.950
The young people, here,

26
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.630
seem to have very clear ideas.

27
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.230
They are preparing something
that I wasn't expecting.


28
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.030
I see they are determined to take risks.

29
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.350
They are united by a single purpose

30
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.830
and they act as if
they were one single body.


31
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.030
Without leaders, without ideologies.

32
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.790
This is new.

33
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.750
These are the accessories

34
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.030
that I use to protect myself.

35
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.550
With the hood on, it's better.

36
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.910
It protects me from the tear gas.

37
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.790
Do you always wear the flowers?

38
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.110
Yes, this hood is a part of me.

39
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.430
Why do you wear the flowers?

40
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.430
I think the flowers represent me.

41
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.350
I also have them tattooed on my body.

42
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.310
They represent me so much that...

43
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.670
In fact,

44
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.830
with the revolt, 
I've blossomed.

45
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.190
I could put it like that.

46
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.510
The uprising gave me strength,
it gave me life.


47
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.030
Being able to help people,
to fight for my people,


48
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.230
that's something that touched me here.

49
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.510
I have nothing to do with politics.

50
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.390
I'm not a member of any party.

51
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.790
And I'm not the only one.

52
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.470
There are many of
us who think this way.

53
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.430
We might be killed.

54
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.270
I have a son,
I'm doing this for him.

55
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.790
If they kill me,
he'll live with my memory.


56
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.350
If I lose an eye,
I'll still be there for him.


57
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.870
If they hurt my legs, 
I'll carry on.

58
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.470
If the cops arrest me,
I'll suffer, but they'll let me go.


59
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.550
So nobody must worry, 
I'll be alright.

60
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.310
Look after my son.

61
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.710
Look after him
and if anything happens to me,


62
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.070
take him in and look after him.

63
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.110
That's what I say to myself
each time I leave home.


64
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.310
I know that each time I leave,
I may not return.


65
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.750
But we must do this
so that they listen to us,


66
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.830
so they pay attention to us.

67
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.470
Because there are people
who have nothing to eat.


68
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.270
It happened to me.

69
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.550
I had to pay for university

70
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.110
and I had no money left
to feed myself or my son.


71
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.390
He is nine years old.

72
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.950
He's a big boy.

73
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.350
He's nine years old.

74
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.150
He has his own hood.

75
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.670
He covers one eye
when he sees the cops.


76
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.870
He detests the cops,
but I didn't influence him.


77
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.350
It's because of what he sees on TV.

78
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.950
They showed things on TV.

79
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.190
Afterwards, it was censured,
but that's another subject.


80
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.550
He saw it on social media.

81
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.310
Videos.

82
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.790
He wanted to be a police officer.

83
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.630
I would say to him:

84
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.310
"Tomás, it's your decision.

85
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.070
"I live my life as I want to,
you must do the same.


86
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.750
"I won't say anything.

87
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.990
"But don't be a cop with no morals.

88
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.270
"I didn't bring you up that way."

89
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.550
And he would reply:
"I will be a good cop."


90
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.430
Dumb cops!

91
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.950
Cops, I'm ashamed of you!

92
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.870
Murdering cops!

93
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.070
Bastards!

94
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.270
Murderers!

95
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.470
We're all on the frontline.

96
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.390
Everyone is equally important.

97
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.310
Some are braver than others,
that's for sure,


98
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.870
but we are all on the frontline,

99
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.190
from those who carry the shields,

100
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.190
to the families sitting on the grass
with their banners.


101
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.150
I believe we are all equally important.

102
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.430
It is thanks to us
that this is becoming reality.


103
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.510
That's what scares
the cops and the State.


104
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.310
We are acting out of love,

105
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.150
we act because we are courageous

106
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.790
and because we must fight.

107
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.150
We are courageous.

108
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.190
I wonder, how is it possible

109
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.430
that I am facing
a second revolution in Chile?


110
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.470
What happened
that woke up an entire country?


111
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.870
Each time I came back,

112
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.110
I noticed that Chile
was turning into a shopping mall,


113
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.030
a display window that didn't show
what was behind it.


114
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.630
That lasted for thirty years.

115
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:58.230
Meanwhile,
three fearless generations were born.


116
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.110
When I was young,
I lived through a revolution


117
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.550
that was led by the political parties.

118
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.070
Today, the movement
is wary of the political parties


119
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.870
and of all the institutions.

120
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.390
I wonder how it all began?

121
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.670
In October 2019,

122
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.510
subway fares increased by thirty pesos.

123
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.270
I never imagined

124
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.550
that this would be the spark
that set the country on fire.


125
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.430
<i>Fare dodging,</i>
<i>is another way of fighting</i>


126
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.350
<i>If you don't jump you're a cop!</i>

127
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.350
Not paying your subway ticket

128
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.470
was an expression
of anger and furious indignation.


129
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.630
The conflict spread.

130
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.710
Fires were started, stores attacked,

131
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.830
pharmacies and banks were looted.

132
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.870
A mixture of things
that were hard to understand.


133
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.390
There was an atmosphere
of liberation, adventure,


134
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.550
and street fights.

135
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.470
On October 19,

136
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.470
the President of the Republic,
Sebastián Piñera,


137
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.470
declared a state of emergency.

138
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.710
We are at war

139
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.310
against an enemy who is powerful,

140
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.790
ruthless,

141
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.390
who respects nothing and nobody,

142
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.790
who is willing to use violence

143
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.310
and delinquency without limits,

144
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.150
even when that involves
loss of human life.


145
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.070
An enemy willing to burn our hospitals,

146
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.550
our subways, our grocery stores

147
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.550
with one sole objective:

148
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.630
to create the maximum possible damage.

149
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.830
I had never seen,
other than under the military regime,


150
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.150
a head of State
deciding to call in the army


151
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.470
to resolve social conflict.

152
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.550
As a Chilean,
seeing the soldiers in the street


153
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.070
reminds me of the coup d'État.

154
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.950
The people's rejection of them
was immediate.


155
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.310
Soldiers get lost!

156
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.550
On Friday October 25,

157
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.030
1,200,000 people

158
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.310
gathered in Plaza Baquedano.

159
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.150
I had never seen anything like it.

160
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.390
They told their president:

161
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.030
"You are wrong, we are not at war!"

162
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.670
It was the biggest people's protest

163
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.750
in the history of Chile.

164
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.790
I am moved to see an entire country

165
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.430
breaking the silence
with such determination.


166
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.110
I don't think anybody had foreseen

167
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:16.270
the effect of the revolt
that altered the soul of Chile.


168
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.950
It was very strange

169
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.510
to enter a subway station

170
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.150
and to go out
into a very different Chile.


171
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.790
I came out of Santa Lucía station

172
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.150
and there were people with saucepans.

173
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.390
They were shouting and walking
towards Plaza Dignidad.


174
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.950
I burst into tears.

175
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.950
Seeing people shouting
and waving banners.


176
00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.070
People I never imagined
I would see at protests.


177
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.150
And I began to cry.

178
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.790
I took my friend's
hand and said to her:

179
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.350
"We've been saying it for years."

180
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.270
We've always spoken about this.

181
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.070
People have realized
that we are exploited.


182
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.830
This system is permanently oppressing

183
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.630
women, the disadvantaged,
the rural areas, the laborers.


184
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.030
It was very moving

185
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.910
to see the image
of a woman with a banner


186
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.390
that demanded a rise
in pensions or a new model,


187
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.110
while banging her saucepan.

188
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.630
She could be my grandmother
who wasn't able to be there,


189
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.350
but people are protesting for her

190
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.110
and for all the victims
of this shameful pension system.


191
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.270
It was amazing to come out of the subway
into a different world,


192
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.950
a different Chile,

193
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.870
the Chile in which I'd wanted to live
for a long time.


194
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.550
CHILE WITHOUT FEAR

195
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.230
I dream of a different society.

196
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.350
I want to live in a Chile
that offers basic standards of living.


197
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.310
Not even dignified,
just basic, such as housing.


198
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.030
Some children, in the shanty towns,
do their homework on the floor.


199
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.390
The State has never taken measures
to give them a decent home.


200
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.790
We will fight for what we deserve,
which is dignity.


201
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.070
That is all I
hope for of this Chile

202
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.150
that we are starting to build.

203
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.950
<i>It woke up, it woke up</i>

204
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.230
<i>Chile has woken up!</i>

205
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.110
"Outburst" isn't the word,
it was more of a relief


206
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.950
to be able to go outside
and speak or shout your mind.


207
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.670
People were laughing and dancing.

208
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.150
One week later, there was that big march

209
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.510
that was more carefully planned.

210
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.030
There were banners, etc.

211
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.550
But on that Friday, it was chaos.

212
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.830
A marvelous chaos.

213
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.030
There were people dancing,
older women...


214
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.110
I still can't quite believe it.

215
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.990
But I'm left with the feeling
of a wonderful buzz,


216
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.790
as if the soul
has returned to the body.

217
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.430
"It's strange, I am on fire.
We are on fire!"


218
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.830
That was the start
of the social outburst.


219
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.270
It was the beginning,
when the young people revolted.


220
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.270
I remember the emotion
I felt at that moment.


221
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.950
People were so happy.

222
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.270
There was no fear
and the students were so moved.


223
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.990
They were worked up and angry too.

224
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.910
The fear disappeared.

225
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.550
The young people had had enough
of poverty, of exploitation


226
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.910
and of precariousness.

227
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.430
And all of a sudden, they did this.

228
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.830
This is a photo

229
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.230
of the frontline
who were defending the protesters.


230
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.430
Those stones were the people's weapons.

231
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.990
They broke the ground with hammers.

232
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.350
They banged relentlessly
to release the paving stones.


233
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.990
Those stones were their only weapons.

234
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.230
For me,

235
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.150
this Chile, riddled with bullets,

236
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.350
this half-destroyed Chile

237
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.750
is being transformed.

238
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.270
It is a Chile in flames.

239
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:46.110
This flag dotted with holes
symbolizes the bullets


240
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.910
that they shot at us.

241
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.910
During the first days of the protests,
everything was improvised.


242
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.390
People only wore their hoods.

243
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.150
Then, they realized
there was a real danger,


244
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.910
a real danger in the streets.

245
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.950
The protesters could be badly wounded

246
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.150
or they could die.

247
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.670
"I want you to take a photo

248
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.350
"just of my mutilated eye."

249
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.430
I asked him if he was sure,
because it would be intense.


250
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.750
He said: "I want this to be seen.

251
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.030
"In Chile, human rights
are systematically violated.


252
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.270
"Look what they did to me,
they burst my eye!


253
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.870
"They shot at my face
from less than 20 meters.


254
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.510
"I want people to know that.

255
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.950
"Please, take a photo of me."

256
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.710
Cameras played a fundamental role
in this revolt.


257
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.510
They couldn't repress,
kill or torture us more


258
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.350
because there were ten cameras
filming what they were doing.


259
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.190
That is also the reason
why we became targets.


260
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.110
All those who, like me, were observing,
journalists and photographers,


261
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.390
we became targets and were shot at.

262
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.470
They shot me in the eye.

263
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.550
The impact...

264
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.150
was very brutal.

265
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.350
I felt a pain...

266
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.790
I had never felt anything like it.

267
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.150
It felt like my head
was going to explode.


268
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.910
I felt...

269
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.990
With the impact,

270
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:47.310
I felt that my eye
had knocked against my skull.


271
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.670
It was atrocious.

272
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.710
I fell to the ground, 
I lost my balance.

273
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.870
I was terrified
as I couldn't see anything.


274
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.550
I saw a dark shadow

275
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.390
in my wounded eye.

276
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.430
Your left eye?

277
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.230
You can no longer
see well with that eye?

278
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.910
I can see rays
of light on the sides.

279
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.510
It is still inflamed.

280
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.510
Looking on the bright side,
it could have been worse.


281
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.750
At least I don't need a prosthesis.

282
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.870
But they have still done me
terrible damage.


283
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.390
I felt alone,
nobody could understand how bad it was


284
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.750
to lose your sight
when it's your work tool.


285
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.110
Why did it happen to me?

286
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.470
Why wasn't I wounded
in the face or an arm,


287
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.190
why did it have to be my eye?

288
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.230
<i>Your silence is an accomplice</i>

289
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.550
<i>Of the gunshots, of the abuse</i>

290
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.110
<i>Of the humiliation!</i>

291
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.950
<i>Your silence is an accomplice</i>

292
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.870
<i>Of the lies, the violence</i>
<i>and the harassment!</i>


293
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.990
<i>Your silence is an accomplice</i>

294
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.870
<i>Of the powerlessness, of the pain</i>

295
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.110
<i>Of the failure of your conscience!</i>

296
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.030
<i>Your silence is an accomplice</i>

297
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.070
<i>Of the pepper spray, of the contempt</i>
<i>and of the blindness!</i>


298
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.630
<i>Your silence is an accomplice</i>

299
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.150
I've been a first aid worker
for one year.


300
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.150
I never could have imagined

301
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.270
everything that I've seen.

302
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.190
So many seriously wounded...

303
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.230
A panic attack is serious.
People think they are dying.


304
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.270
But concerning physical health,

305
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.230
we've had deaths.
There's nothing more serious.


306
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.870
I've had to deal with eye injuries,

307
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.510
open fractures,
people who've been run over.


308
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.110
Now, all that is par for the course.

309
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.750
I had never experienced confrontation.

310
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:24.750
I'm not somebody who fights,
I'm a peacemaker.


311
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.870
But the fear is there
and I will never get rid of it.


312
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.110
The fear that I feel because of
what I've seen and experienced,


313
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.550
it won't go away,
I'll always be afraid of the authorities.


314
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.310
When it's curfew time, I rush home.

315
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.950
Not because I respect the curfew
but because I'm afraid of the military.


316
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.710
Especially because I'm a woman

317
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.150
and they have weapons of war.

318
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.430
As a first-aid worker,
I've experienced extreme situations.


319
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.390
I've received blows from a baton.

320
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.190
Colleagues had to protect us
from military attacks


321
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.790
while we performed first aid.

322
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.270
They've thrown tear gas at us.

323
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.550
We have to wear shields
and protective gear.


324
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.670
Not because we have to kneel down,

325
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.990
but to avoid being wounded
by the military.


326
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.350
We are medical staff.

327
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.670
Our role is precious.

328
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.430
Without us, there would be more deaths.

329
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.230
We had to protect ourselves
because we were in real danger.


330
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.630
People aren't protesting
for just one reason.


331
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.070
The people we see in the streets,
after this first stage,


332
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.270
are people who feel
a general dissatisfaction.


333
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.670
That won't alter with one law change.

334
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.830
It would be a start,

335
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.830
but right now, they have

336
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.750
parents who receive a pathetic pension,

337
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.230
a brother dying of cancer,

338
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.150
children who are forced into debt
to study,


339
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.430
or to whom the
banks won't give a loan.

340
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.830
These things will surely change,
but people need immediate solutions.


341
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.630
They don't want to
give up and go home.

342
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.670
They finally feel part of a movement
and can voice their discontent.


343
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.950
What unites us are our moral values,
our ethical values.


344
00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:01.110
It's a question of civic-mindedness,
it's fundamental.


345
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.230
What we have in common is saving lives.

346
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.470
Colleagues of mine have shielded me
and been shot at


347
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.350
to protect me
while I was giving first aid.


348
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.390
Nothing could unite us more than that.

349
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.150
It's touching to hear the young say:

350
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.830
"I can't stand seeing
my grandparents forced to work,


351
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.870
"selling things in the street
to survive."


352
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.550
It makes me want to cry

353
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.230
when I see a 17-year-old boy

354
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.710
collecting the garbage,

355
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.310
who looks at me and says:
"Yes, I had to give up school


356
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.030
"because I have to help
my grandparents and my parents,


357
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.270
"as they are fragile.

358
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.070
"I will try to go back to school.

359
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.070
"But for now, I'm doing this
and I'm proud of it


360
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.870
"because I'm supporting my family."

361
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.710
One year has passed since October 18,

362
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.630
and not a single measure has been taken

363
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.430
to help

364
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.030
and reassure all those who have nothing

365
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.950
and who urgently need state help.

366
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.630
One year has passed.

367
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.310
Not one single measure has been taken

368
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.990
to say to those people:
"The system will help you."


369
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.030
How many women

370
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.310
represent the majority
of poor families today,


371
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.950
heads of the household,

372
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.870
without a man
to help them raise their children?


373
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.030
73% of babies in this country

374
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.510
are born out of wedlock.

375
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.870
73%!

376
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.990
We don't know how many women
make up these poor households,


377
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.510
we only know that they count
for more than 60%.


378
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.270
But how many are there
and in which municipalities?


379
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.670
We would only need to compare data
and to go find them.


380
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.710
These women need urgent help.

381
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.750
These are the women who are protesting.

382
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.870
They have nobody
to look after their children


383
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.110
so they can't go out to work.

384
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.630
They don't receive any help at all.

385
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.990
I see them every day

386
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.430
and I'm left speechless.

387
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.990
During the dictatorship,
women had to search for their partners


388
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.350
who were prisoners

389
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.230
in the concentration camps
or who had disappeared.


390
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:47.470
They travelled all over the country

391
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.950
to look for them in the barracks,
morgues or hospitals.


392
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.230
Afterwards, they went out to work,

393
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:58.110
washing clothes for others,
cleaning houses,


394
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.350
then, little by little,

395
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.270
they became housewives again.

396
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.190
This time, there will be no going back.

397
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.350
This movement will have the face
and the voice of women.


398
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.430
There will be no going back
in this country.


399
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.150
Women are furious.

400
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.830
And they are right.

401
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.510
They are totally right.

402
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.550
The youngest women, the students,

403
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.830
often speak of sexual freedom.

404
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.070
I think they are right,

405
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.270
because the right to make love
is a human right.


406
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.030
Of course.

407
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.470
Women have been denied this right
for centuries.


408
00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.550
But there are many women

409
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.790
who, forced to clean offices
from morning to night,


410
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.070
their hands are covered...

411
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.510
with cracked skin.

412
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.430
They can't even caress their children.

413
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:15.670
They come home exhausted
to make food for their children


414
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.430
and notice that one of them
has new sneakers.


415
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.150
They don't even ask
where the shoes came from,


416
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.430
because they already know:
the drug traffickers!


417
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.190
Those women don't even think
about making love.


418
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.190
They just want somebody
to help them raise their children.


419
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.910
It has never been said

420
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.910
that making love was a human right
that had to be defended.


421
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.990
For women.

422
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.350
How long have you lived here?

423
00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.910
I've been in this camp for nine months.

424
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.470
What will happen here?

425
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.670
I'm fighting to obtain housing.

426
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.630
I'm head of the Housing Committee
"Towards a reality".


427
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.350
That's the name of our school too.

428
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.630
I cannot give up.

429
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.190
People here don't trust the politicians?

430
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.550
They are just lining their pockets.

431
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.910
Here, thousands of people have turned up:

432
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.990
counsellors, deputies,

433
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.830
from all over,
from each municipality.


434
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.270
All those idiots, sorry to say it,

435
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.310
they only think of getting rich.

436
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.070
They turn up here
to take advantage of us,


437
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.470
to benefit from our needs.

438
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.630
That's the truth, damn it!

439
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.550
We don't see them here
the rest of the year,


440
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.430
they only come before the elections.

441
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.550
It proves they think only
of themselves, not the people.


442
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.430
Come get some candy!

443
00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.110
Irma, did you tell the kids?

444
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.310
Tell them to come get some candy.

445
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.550
No, it's for the under 14's.

446
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.390
Those who live here know the reality.

447
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.390
People may criticize the camps

448
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.230
because it's true,
you can find delinquents here.


449
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:25.270
But there are families too,
not just delinquents.


450
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.310
I have three daughters, a husband.

451
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.790
We are a family
who came here to find a home.


452
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.950
We want our own space, some comfort.
Do you see?


453
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.390
You have to live here
to be able to speak of our reality.


454
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:41.510
Others can't talk about it,
they haven't lived here.


455
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.870
They've never stepped
outside their bubble.


456
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.750
They've never lacked
a piece of bread or some milk.


457
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.630
That is what we are fighting for:
equality!


458
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.750
We are fighting for that together,
as a community.


459
00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.030
There was a feeling of victory,
a beautiful atmosphere in the square.


460
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.710
THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE

461
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.910
We heard

462
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.150
the noise of a saucepan in the distance.

463
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.150
And Nati said to me:

464
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.630
"A saucepan!"

465
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.510
She got up,

466
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.550
we picked up a saucepan and we began

467
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.390
to bang it.
We didn't stop to think.


468
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:33.710
After one hour,

469
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.390
it had become this amazing orchestra.

470
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:41.790
We went out into the streets
where people were gathering.


471
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.550
It was a moment...

472
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:48.110
Friends came to see us
and we began to talk


473
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.350
about this shared feeling
we all carried inside us,


474
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.190
deep down inside.

475
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.150
That feeling

476
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.710
of bitterness, of constant sadness,

477
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.390
of disgust and injustice

478
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.950
was a lot stronger than it appeared.

479
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.390
That is what initiated
our conversations.


480
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.510
We didn't just wake up one day
and suddenly realize.


481
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.830
It had been slowly building up

482
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.390
for quite a while.

483
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.790
But it exploded, it burst,

484
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.950
and now we are going to change things,
there's no going back.


485
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.430
Civic responsibility
still isn't taught in schools.


486
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.270
Civics just isn't taught.

487
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.350
We grew up hearing people say:

488
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.630
"You mustn't talk about
politics or religion."


489
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.870
Isn't that right?

490
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.350
You couldn't express an opinion,
that was bad manners.


491
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.550
I think we are disconnected.

492
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:19.950
The politicians are disconnected
from the people and vice-versa.


493
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.390
And people are disconnected
from politics too.


494
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.830
I think the politicians deceived us.

495
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.030
They promised us many things.

496
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.030
They sedated us heavily

497
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.230
over the last thirty years.

498
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.150
Major social change takes a lot of time.

499
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.830
We must be patient.

500
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.430
These changes are not for us.

501
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.830
They are for the next generations,

502
00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.030
for future generations.

503
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.310
Chile is known for being backward.

504
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.070
<i>If you don't jump you're a cop!</i>

505
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.990
I think there is a flame.

506
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.550
I hope that this flame

507
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.910
will serve an important purpose.

508
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.670
That it will create a fire

509
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.550
that will help to build this new Chile.

510
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.270
We know how to light fires.

511
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.870
My father used to take me
on the railroaders' strikes.


512
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.270
There was always a fire and a tin,
an empty can...


513
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.230
A can for toasted flour.

514
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.950
In that can,

515
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.790
they put rags and gasoline

516
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.310
when we went into the street.

517
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.190
I'll never forget that
because it was very impressive.


518
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.910
There are flames that consume
and flames that nourish.


519
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.830
We'll see what happens.

520
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.790
No violence!

521
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:33.150
We have reached a level of violence
that's never been seen in Chile.


522
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.230
I think that violence has laid bare
our problem with the police,


523
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.870
which is not something new.

524
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.470
This isn't a result of the revolt,
it's an old problem.


525
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.550
The use of the military

526
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.630
to suppress the protests.

527
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.870
That allows them, in some way,
to justify their violence


528
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.470
and lack of respect of the rules.

529
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:02.270
The police force is considered
a politicized enemy.


530
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.110
There is total divorce
between the armed forces


531
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.150
and the civilian population.

532
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.790
There is no real monitoring
by the Chilean State


533
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.630
of what is taught in the military

534
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:18.910
or the police academies.

535
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:22.390
That hid many problems
inherited from the dictatorship.


536
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.990
Today, with the revolt
and the police tactics,


537
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.150
we are paying the price
for not acknowledging or resolving


538
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.750
the problems inherited
from the dictatorship.


539
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:38.510
<i>The people, united,</i>
<i>will never be defeated!</i>


540
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.710
I cannot believe
that I'm in present-day Chile.


541
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.910
I feel like I'm witnessing a civil war.

542
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:39.510
The police violence
reminds me of Pinochet's era.


543
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.750
The armed men

544
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.870
appear to be fueled
by unrestrained impulses,


545
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.430
without leadership,
without a legal framework.


546
00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.270
It really is unbearable.

547
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:24.110
I never imagined
I would see here, once again,


548
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.870
what I saw more than forty years ago.

549
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.310
The repression is so violent

550
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.070
that it provokes anger and despair.

551
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.470
I am anxious about
the outcome of this struggle.


552
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:43.630
Who will lose and who will win?

553
00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.430
For a long time,
we found it normal to pay for everything


554
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.790
and normal that certain people got rich
on the back of cheap labor.


555
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:02.230
To receive a good education,
you had to pay.


556
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.830
To receive good medical care,
you had to pay.


557
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.950
We no longer believe that is normal.

558
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.630
There was a feeling of indignation.

559
00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.070
That's why they renamed the square
"Dignity".


560
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.390
Ultimately, the indignation soaked in.

561
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.470
At the same time, it blossomed.

562
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.470
People began to form Open Councils.

563
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.550
Everybody wanted to take part.

564
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.470
The Open Councils grew and multiplied.

565
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.990
What did people want most?

566
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:40.550
To change the Constitution.

567
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:41.830
Why?

568
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:47.270
Because even though
they had tried to hide


569
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.470
the fact that we had
a terrible Constitution


570
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.870
and a terrible system of government,

571
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.190
people realized it for themselves.

572
00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.750
The information was circulating,

573
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.750
we knew that the Constitution
was important.


574
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.390
But never before had social unease

575
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:08.150
developed a solution:

576
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.470
to change the Constitution.

577
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.350
The objective of the Open Councils

578
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.070
was to determine what people wanted
for the country


579
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:21.070
and what was actually
in the Constitution.


580
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.950
We realized it was terrible
and needed to be changed.


581
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.430
The social outburst

582
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.830
has also sparked
a creative outburst in Chile.


583
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.350
The rupture is violent,

584
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.950
but it is also full of joy.

585
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:52.270
Now, there are not only stones.

586
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.230
There is also a horizon for the future.

587
00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:01.030
The current economic model
seems outdated.


588
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.390
The fear of talking about the chaos
has disappeared.


589
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:10.990
That is the feeling of many families
and of society in general.


590
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:14.150
I APPROVE

591
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.190
These four women wrote a poem

592
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.990
that has been sung
by thousands of Chilean women.


593
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.790
All Chilean women were able
to identify with this poem,


594
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.550
women of all ages

595
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.390
and beyond borders.

596
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.630
<i>The patriarchy is a judge</i>

597
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.670
<i>Who judges us for being born</i>

598
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.870
<i>And our punishment</i>

599
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.430
<i>Is the violence that you see</i>

600
00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:00.910
<i>It's not my fault,</i>
<i>it's not the place, it's not my clothes</i>


601
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:08.750
<i>It's not my fault,</i>
<i>it's not the place, it's not my clothes</i>


602
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:14.750
<i>The rapist is you!</i>

603
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.270
<i>The rapist is you!</i>

604
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.270
<i>It's the cops...</i>

605
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:26.270
Here, in Chile, the popular revolt
has being going on for one year.


606
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:27.870
It is huge.

607
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.470
This revolt comes from the base,

608
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:33.070
it has no leaders,

609
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.990
no individuals who, in some way,

610
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:39.990
might lead this revolt
towards a fixed goal.


611
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:42.430
That is what makes it complicated

612
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.750
to initiate negotiations
with the authorities.


613
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:50.190
And that's a good thing, as we don't want
to negotiate with anyone.


614
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.910
We just want to change things,
that's all!


615
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.390
We want to put an end to this system
that has put us at risk


616
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:02.270
in a deeply inhuman way.

617
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:06.190
The protesters didn't demand
a referendum,


618
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.070
but a constituent assembly.

619
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:12.030
There was a referendum,
we voted for this constitutional change.


620
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:15.870
We know that symbolically,
it is an important first step


621
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:19.790
because it is very violent
to carry on living in a country


622
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.670
governed by the laws
of a military dictatorship


623
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.670
and to continue experiencing
the direct consequences


624
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.070
of that horrendous period

625
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.070
of our history.

626
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:35.230
We know that this is the first step,

627
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.270
but the change we are demanding
goes a lot further.


628
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.830
It's a socio-cultural change.

629
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.190
That's why us women

630
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.230
think that the demands
of the popular uprising,


631
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.150
of the revolt,
are also feminist demands.


632
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.030
Therefore, the solutions

633
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.150
should be tackled
from a feminist point of view.


634
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:57.510
These are not lesser demands,

635
00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:01.630
they aren't just about sexual abuse,
for example.


636
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.830
They concern everybody's well-being,

637
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.190
everybody's dignity.

638
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.870
We want people to be able to have a life,
not just to survive.


639
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:16.430
That is what we have done
for too long in this country.


640
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:18.550
If you ask us for our opinion:

641
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.790
we hope that
the neo-liberal system burns,


642
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:24.030
that the patriarchy burns,

643
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.950
and that all of
the harmful institutions burn,


644
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.470
those that perpetuate

645
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.270
the situation we are in today.

646
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:35.110
We can no longer live
with these kinds of institutions


647
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:36.910
in our society.

648
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.270
It's impossible.

649
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.350
We aspire to this macro-social change.

650
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.070
We know it is hard,
it must be done step by step,


651
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.150
one of which is the rewriting
of the Constitution.


652
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:52.030
But we hope to live
to see this concrete change.


653
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:55.150
Until all forms of oppression have ended,

654
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:57.990
we will always face the same problems,

655
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:59.350
that's the reality.

656
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:01.710
Because it's a very perverse system,

657
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.830
one that unfortunately,
has been well constructed.


658
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:16.510
<i>The patriarchy is a judge</i>

659
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.430
<i>Who judges us for being born</i>

660
00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:23.910
<i>And our punishment</i>

661
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.510
<i>Is the violence you can't see</i>

662
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:32.430
<i>It's not my fault,</i>
<i>it's not the place, it's not my clothes</i>


663
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:36.070
<i>It's not my fault,</i>
<i>it's not the place, it's not my clothes</i>


664
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.550
<i>The rapist is you!</i>

665
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:42.670
<i>The rapist is you!</i>

666
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:46.270
<i>It's the police</i>

667
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:49.630
<i>The judges</i>

668
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.390
<i>The State</i>

669
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.190
<i>The President</i>

670
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.310
<i>The oppressive State is a macho rapist!</i>

671
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.270
<i>The oppressive State is a macho rapist!</i>

672
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:33.470
For months,

673
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:38.550
many people kept the sound
of disapproval resounding.


674
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:42.350
It is the sound of indignation,

675
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.470
like a symphony of protest

676
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:49.510
that will not stop
until there's a solution.


677
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.110
I APPROVE, IF NOT, WHAT'S THE POINT?

678
00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.310
I APPROVE

679
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:07.830
Today, we have the chance
to create a true democracy


680
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.750
that reflects the plurality
of Chilean society.


681
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.190
We have never had that.

682
00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.270
In these thirty years of democracy,

683
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:18.310
our plurality has not been represented
in the political system


684
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:22.190
because the rules of the game
falsify the reports.


685
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.830
They hinder some public policies,

686
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:27.270
even though many people want them.

687
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:35.110
But I think we should address
the specific problems.


688
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.870
In Chile, the major problems
are the excessive elitism of politics,


689
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.470
the concentration of power and exclusion.

690
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.910
We have denied the Indian peoples
representation


691
00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:48.070
for far too long.

692
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.230
Chile hasn't advanced, it's one
of the most conservative countries,


693
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.310
whose political participation
is based on centralism.


694
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:57.950
To this day,

695
00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:01.030
Congress is composed mainly
of elderly men,


696
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:03.190
most of whom are related to each other.

697
00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:06.870
It really is an inadmissible elitism

698
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.150
during a political period

699
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:13.190
in which people are demanding
different levels of participation.


700
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.910
<i>The people, the people</i>

701
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.150
<i>Where are the people?</i>

702
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:23.110
<i>The people are in the streets</i>
<i>demanding dignity!</i>


703
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:52.310
A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY NOW!

704
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:56.550
The constituent process
will allow us to be open to uncertainty.


705
00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:00.470
Uncertainty generates anxiety and fear,

706
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.830
but it is necessary
for the legitimacy of the policy.


707
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.990
If there is no uncertainty,

708
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:07.550
there is no democracy.

709
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:13.030
What is happening is positive,

710
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.790
but I wish it had happened earlier.

711
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:20.870
If only 400 people hadn't lost an eye
for us to get here.


712
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:35.990
In almost every film I make,
we see the National Stadium,


713
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.230
as if I were a football player.

714
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:42.230
During the dictatorship,

715
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:46.310
it was Pinochet's
biggest concentration camp.


716
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:50.550
I was imprisoned here
with thousands of other prisoners.


717
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.510
That marked me forever.

718
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:03.550
The Stadium also acts as a polling place.

719
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.270
Today,

720
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.510
people are voting for the end
of Pinochet's Constitution


721
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.710
in order to write a new one.

722
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.910
Faced with pressure from the people,

723
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:18.510
the government and political parties
had no other choice


724
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.310
but to organize this referendum.

725
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:26.350
On the same day,
the results are published.


726
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.910
80% of votes want a constituent assembly

727
01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:34.430
to write the new constitution.

728
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:39.790
That is the victory
of the social outburst.


729
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.990
For a long time,

730
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.710
Parliament was the center and the heart

731
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.470
of the country's political history.

732
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:37.110
A place of discussion, conflict

733
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:40.150
and laws that were approved or rejected.

734
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:45.470
After the coup d'État, in 1973,

735
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.270
Pinochet, the dictator, dissolved it

736
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.910
and abandoned it after its evacuation.

737
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.750
For years, it remained empty.

738
01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:11.430
I often filmed here
when I made "The Battle of Chile".


739
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.790
I had to come and go

740
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:17.750
according to the decisions taken
by the members of parliament.


741
01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:24.670
For me, the never-ending world
of the political game was a mystery.


742
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:30.670
I remember the hallways
and the noise of the comings and goings.


743
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.510
It was a hive

744
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:38.350
full of smoke and glasses of tea
that they served during the sessions.


745
01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:54.950
Today, as if History were being repaired,

746
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:59.470
this place is finally recovering
its purpose.


747
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:04.710
It is here that the members
of the Constituent Assembly


748
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:09.190
will write the new Constitution
over the coming months.


749
01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:13.150
Nobody could have imagined
something like this happening


750
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.950
just two years ago.

751
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.190
In chess,

752
01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:24.390
the most important pieces are the pawns

753
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.310
but nobody says that.

754
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.070
People think it's the Queen.

755
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:32.070
Well, I see a certain symbolism.

756
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.910
There are eight pawns.

757
01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:36.870
It's the only piece
that is reproduced eight times


758
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:40.390
and when all eight work together,
they define everything:


759
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.910
the movements of the other pieces,

760
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:47.030
the position of the defense,
the attack strategy,


761
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.630
who controls the center

762
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:51.430
and therefore, the whole chessboard.

763
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:56.030
I think that this, in the Convention,
is very clear.


764
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.670
Very clear.

765
01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.870
We have approved

766
01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:02.270
many popular participation mechanisms.

767
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:05.270
Generally speaking,

768
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:09.190
us members of the Convention,
that is where we come from.


769
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:11.710
We are part of these people.

770
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:16.150
It's not just a number, it's the reality.

771
01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.710
When we discuss the various issues

772
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:23.750
of the new Constitution,
regulatory or more important ones,


773
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:26.190
we see that we all have shared history.

774
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:28.670
Nobody told us about public health,

775
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.910
nobody told us stories
about public education,


776
01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.470
we experienced it firsthand.

777
01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:38.190
And that is very precious.

778
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.990
It's a process of constant debate.

779
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.230
We are also constantly listening

780
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:49.190
to the citizens, the young people,
the children.


781
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.990
I think it's quite an intense process.

782
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:57.030
The most intense process
I've been involved with.


783
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:58.350
In your life?

784
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:03.070
It's like playing in a chess tournament,
but every day.


785
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.030
It's very, very intense.

786
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.910
When we began this process,

787
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:20.670
we didn't only think about
the constitutional text.


788
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:22.630
We did it, thinking that

789
01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:25.790
writing a new Constitution,

790
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:29.710
the first one written
in a democratic context,


791
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:33.150
the first one in the world
to be written with equality,


792
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:35.910
was one stage of a journey.

793
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.550
For decades,
we've been fighting for matters


794
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.870
that are partial:

795
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.630
we fight for free, decent,
non-sexist public education,


796
01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:51.750
we fight against
specific extractive projects.


797
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.390
Gradually,
we are generalizing our outlook.


798
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.950
We fight against patriarchal violence,

799
01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:00.230
probably one of the most general issues.

800
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:05.390
But now, we'll be addressing everything
at the same time.


801
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:07.430
Everything.

802
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.630
That will probably cause an earthquake.

803
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.350
My name is Valentina Miranda.

804
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:15.670
I live in Lo Espejo,

805
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:18.270
one of the poorest municipalities
in Chile.


806
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.390
I am a radical and homosexual activist,

807
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.150
a young, feminist woman,

808
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:25.670
ex-representative of the
Federation of High-school Associations,


809
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.790
the first in my family
to go to university,


810
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:31.550
born of public education
and a humble family,


811
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.110
daughter of the slums.

812
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:37.150
I grew up surrounded by drugs,
poverty and extractivism,


813
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.470
violation of human rights and corruption.

814
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:43.950
I am 21 years old, a hick,
a bumpkin, scum, an Indian.


815
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.990
Proud to be a campaigner
for the Communist Youth.


816
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:51.270
I am convinced that the Constitution
written here will be ecological,


817
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.830
feminist, multinational, intercultural,

818
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:57.990
and that it will enable
all people to thrive.


819
01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:02.390
I don't forget my origins,
as memory is our best weapon.


820
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.070
This is for you, Grandma!

821
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.830
Free the protesters of Santa Adriana!

822
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.470
From the turnstiles to the Convention!

823
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.630
We students have made it here,
the humble will triumph.


824
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:14.070
Thank you very much!

825
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.070
I dared, because I needed to say:

826
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.670
"The young people are here."

827
01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:21.070
Two years ago,

828
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:23.550
we jumped over the subway turnstiles,

829
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:26.110
now, I'm writing the new Constitution.

830
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:29.230
So, it's really...

831
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:32.310
As well as being gratifying,

832
01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:36.710
it is very moving to know,

833
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:39.750
to be aware, now,

834
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.470
that everything we went through
during the 2019 repression


835
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:45.390
and everything that happened

836
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.630
led to this amazing process
that we are experiencing today.


837
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:54.670
We students made the first move,

838
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:59.550
but it turned into a social struggle
of all Chilean people.


839
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.350
What we are writing

840
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:06.550
are the wishes of those who said:
"Enough!"


841
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:10.710
We must build,
that is our main responsibility.


842
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:13.550
Build and move forwards.

843
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:16.670
And hopefully, in the future,

844
01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.110
we won't have to jump over
all those turnstiles,


845
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.270
because I didn't just do it
on October 18,


846
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.510
I had to jump over many more
to get this far.


847
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:43.910
This is a solemn moment.

848
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:47.390
I ask the members
of the Convention to rise,


849
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:48.830
please.

850
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:53.790
Now,

851
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:59.710
in accordance with article 79
of the General Regulation,


852
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:03.830
I declare, before the plenary Assembly,

853
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:08.030
the official opening
of the constitutional debate.


854
01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:09.670
Elisa Loncón

855
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:14.070
is the president
of the constituent Convention.


856
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:17.110
She is also the first Mapuche woman

857
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:20.630
to take on such a role
in the history of Chile.


858
01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.670
She makes us feel
this breath of fresh air


859
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.870
that is traversing the country.

860
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:33.070
Each day,
we deal with many things,


861
01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:37.790
but I am very happy
to be participating in this process.


862
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:41.870
I am also happy for the Mapuche people,

863
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:45.150
for the young people
and for all those women


864
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.470
who see in me so many delays

865
01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.270
but, at the same time,
so many opportunities for action.


866
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:57.190
That makes me so happy
and it fuels my dream of transformation.


867
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:59.510
We are moving forward,

868
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.470
we will achieve
the goal we set ourselves.


869
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:05.870
When we Mapuche, say:

870
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.950
<i>"marichiweu",</i>

871
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:09.630
that means:
"We will never be overcome".


872
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:14.350
It is a word that has historic importance

873
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.110
and one that is also very colloquial.

874
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.430
I learnt it from my grand-mother.

875
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.790
Whenever she achieved something,
she said: "Marichiweu!"


876
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:27.190
I understood that every achievement
should be accompanied by this word.


877
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:31.110
Marichi means "forever",
and "marichiweu":


878
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.790
"We will always win".

879
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:35.270
You can also say "marichi poyeyu",

880
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.030
"I will love you all my life".

881
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.430
With "marichi",
you can create various combinations


882
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:44.270
to express things that will last forever.

883
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:46.630
It's a very pretty word.

884
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:59.550
We also believed
in the permanent changes


885
01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:02.710
initiated by Salvador Allende.

886
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.110
We were happy,

887
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:11.390
but the coup d'État
shattered our lives and our dreams.


888
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:18.750
Today, there is this new hope.

889
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:23.670
I like to think
that the dream is finally happening


890
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:28.230
and that the country we imagined
will become reality.


891
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:37.350
This square has become the symbol
of the street fights,


892
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:41.390
under the indifferent gaze
of General Baquedano,


893
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:45.110
a military hero from the 19th century.

894
01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:52.950
Baquedano and his horse
would never have imagined


895
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:58.030
that their statue would be the center
of these new struggles.


896
01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:01.870
The young people come here

897
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:06.670
to transform this space
into a theater of the future.


898
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:18.070
What is the greatest danger
that could happen?


899
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:19.710
The first,

900
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:22.430
would be if we lose faith
in the Convention


901
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:26.990
to the point where the campaign
against the leaving referendum


902
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.350
wins, for example,

903
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.470
and we are left with
the dictator's Constitution.


904
01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:33.550
For me, that would be terrible.

905
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.710
That could happen,
and it would be the worst thing.


906
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.390
The second danger,

907
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:43.630
is that many things

908
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:48.910
have fueled a sense of patriotism

909
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.270
that is very painful, in Chile.

910
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:56.630
These two things together,
would be a terrible outcome.


911
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.390
Firstly, that we fail
to drive a new Constitution,


912
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.230
we would regret that.

913
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.070
It would be a step backwards,

914
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:08.390
regretting what we said
during the referendum,


915
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:13.350
that we wanted a new Constitution
and that we should defend it.


916
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:16.950
Secondly, that once again,

917
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:19.990
far-right sectors of this country
are re-established,


918
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:23.270
as has happened elsewhere
in Latin America and the world.


919
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.070
That would be fatal.

920
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.350
Is chess also a fight?

921
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:36.430
It's a fight, a confrontation.

922
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:41.270
It's also a space for meetings

923
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.430
and discussions.

924
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:48.630
According to the legend
of the Goddess of chess, Caïssa,


925
01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:52.310
who, at some point, was linked to war,

926
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:57.110
she said:
"Listen, make war on a chessboard.


927
01:13:57.270 --> 01:14:00.110
"Converse, think, imagine, create

928
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.630
"and stop making war outside".

929
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:06.230
But there is a fight.

930
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:07.830
Someone dies.

931
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:09.750
Yes, of course.

932
01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:11.830
You must destroy...

933
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.310
You must capture, rather.

934
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:16.910
You capture, you never kill.

935
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.070
We capture.

936
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:19.750
There is a fair trial.

937
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:22.550
The King is allowed a fair trial.

938
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:49.550
In order to preserve it,
the military removed the statue.


939
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:53.390
Even so, they built a high fence

940
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:55.550
around the empty stand.

941
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.270
That provoked indignation.

942
01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:03.990
A huge crowd converged in the square
on the second anniversary


943
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.270
of the outburst.

944
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:48.990
Everything indicates
that we have reached the end of an era.


945
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:52.630
I feel a new era is beginning.

946
01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:56.990
At the same time,

947
01:16:57.390 --> 01:17:01.110
Chile is voting
for a new president of the Republic.


948
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:05.670
The candidate Gabriel Boric wins.

949
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:10.830
He wins it by 4,600,000 votes

950
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:14.270
against the far-right candidate.

951
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.750
He triumphs thanks to the huge support

952
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:22.670
of young people, women,

953
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:26.070
and of all Chileans who wish for change.

954
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:41.950
These stones now form

955
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.710
the foundations of a new house,

956
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:49.070
in which Chile will open its windows wide

957
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.830
to let the air circulate.

958
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:59.790
I am beginning to see
a new imaginary country.


959
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:18.510
Good evening, Chile!

960
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.310
<i>Po nui</i>

961
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:26.470
<i>suma aruma, pun may, Chile!</i>

962
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.390
Thank you all,

963
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:32.990
every one of you,

964
01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:36.990
all peoples who live
in this place we call Chile.


965
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.350
Today, hope overcame fear!

966
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:51.710
As you know, I come from far away,

967
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:55.830
from the South, from Magallanes,
on the edge of the Antarctic,


968
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:57.670
and I am 35 years old.

969
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:04.630
I am fully aware
that history doesn't start with us.


970
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.230
I feel like an heir,

971
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.510
and that our project is the heir

972
01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:13.190
of a long historical trajectory,

973
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:16.230
that of those whom,
from various positions,


974
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:20.190
have searched tirelessly for justice,

975
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.550
the expansion of democracy,

976
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:25.030
the defense of human rights,

977
01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.030
and the protection of freedoms.

978
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:30.830
That, my large family,
is what I want to see reunited


979
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:33.310
in this chapter which we are initiating.

980
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.990
We are facing an historic change of cycle

981
01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:37.830
that we cannot lose out on!

982
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.790
I would like to thank, in particular,

983
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:45.310
the women of our homeland.

984
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:51.670
They came together,
throughout the entire country,


985
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:56.150
to defend the rights
that they had such difficulty obtaining.


986
01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:01.550
From things so basic
as the right to vote,


987
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:05.910
to the right to be in charge
of their own bodies.


988
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:10.670
From the right to non-discrimination...
