1
00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:13.116
How did you get him
so quickly?


2
00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:15.201
A medical team heard
the shell coming in.


3
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:16.765
Apparently, he did, too.

4
00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:19.763
Chest and belly
practically unmarked.


5
00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:22.239
Curious how they always
double up in the fetal position.


6
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.760
What's curious about it?

7
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.673
They're trying to
protect their genitals.


8
00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:28.670
Well, this young man
unfortunately succeeded.


9
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.626
Any identification?

10
00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:31.710
No, sir.

11
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.057
Then we'll assume he's ours.

12
00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.142
I'll need to take personal
charge of this case


13
00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:37.663
until repairs are completed.

14
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.705
That could be
rather a long time,


15
00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.270
Colonel Tillery.

16
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.788
Wouldn't you say, Captain,

17
00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.832
that it's worth a year
of any doctor's life


18
00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:46.700
to observe
a case like this?


19
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.785
You'd never know what
has happened to him.


20
00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:52.392
The one part of his brain
that has escaped damage


21
00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:54.478
is the medulla oblongata.

22
00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:56.562
It is only because of this

23
00:03:56.562 --> 00:03:58.648
that his heart, vasal, motor,

24
00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:01.255
and respiratory centers
still function.


25
00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.382
In short, that he lives.

26
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.288
Unidentified casualty
number 4-7.


27
00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:15.374
Post-operation orders,

28
00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:16.417
Colonel M.F. Tillery,

29
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:19.023
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

30
00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:21.630
Although the cerebellum
still permits


31
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.194
limited physical movement,

32
00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:25.801
said movement
signifies nothing.


33
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.407
Bodily actions
have become violent,


34
00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:29.971
and are persistently
repetitive


35
00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:33.621
and must be treated as
reflexive muscular spasms--


36
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:36.227
which is to say, by sedation.

37
00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:43.396
The cerebrum has suffered
massive and irreparable damage.


38
00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:44.960
Had I not been sure of this,

39
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.088
I would not have
permitted him to live.


40
00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:55.953
There's no justification
for his continued existence


41
00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:59.038
unless we learn from him
how to help others.


42
00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:01.122
Care for him as gently

43
00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.207
as if he knew
what you were doing


44
00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:06.336
and would feel the pain
if you did it badly.


45
00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:08.943
Attending personnel
will remember that


46
00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:10.462
good medical care forbids

47
00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:13.330
emotional involvement
with the patient.


48
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.373
Avoid such involvement
by remembering


49
00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:19.500
that it is impossible for
a decerebrated individual


50
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.149
to experience pain,
pleasure, memory,


51
00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.756
dreams, or thought
of any kind.


52
00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:29.883
It follows, therefore,
that this young man


53
00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:33.533
will be as unfeeling,
as unthinking as the dead


54
00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:36.140
until the day he joins them.

55
00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.818
Kareen?

56
00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:07.161
Kareen?

57
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.938
What happened?

58
00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:18.152
Where am I?

59
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:27.015
It's dark in here.

60
00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:30.144
Shouldn't have
turned the lights out.


61
00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:32.229
Your old man
will be sore.


62
00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:34.140
Oh, Mike won't care.
He loves me.


63
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.920
Only could I just
ask you one thing?


64
00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:40.485
Why'd you have to volunteer?

65
00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:43.003
Only six months
from the draft anyhow.


66
00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:45.610
Pinkie and Larry
have already gone.


67
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.218
You could have been exempt
because of your sisters.


68
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.781
My mother's got a job.

69
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:51.215
Besides, when the country
needs you, you've gotta go.


70
00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:53.214
You should go.

71
00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:55.865
I don't think
anybody should go.


72
00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:57.861
They'll kill you.

73
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.947
Oh, I could get killed
at the bakery, too,


74
00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:02.033
or crossing the street.

75
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:05.160
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry.


76
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.202
Lots of people get killed
who don't think they'll be.


77
00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:10.201
Lots of people come
back, too. Most of 'em.


78
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:14.111
Most of them, Joe,
they never come back.


79
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:16.023
Oh, if anything ever
happened to you,


80
00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:17.501
I'd just die.

81
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.410
Ah, you're only
saying that.


82
00:08:21.454 --> 00:08:23.451
I love you.

83
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:25.537
I do love you.

84
00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:38.788
Stop it.

85
00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:42.959
I won't have this
in my house.


86
00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.871
You think you're sitting in
the back seat of a flivver?


87
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:47.217
Now get up. Both of you,
get up like decent people.


88
00:08:47.217 --> 00:08:48.781
Come on, get up.

89
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:50.346
But he's going away
in the morning.


90
00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:52.953
I know, I know.
Get in the bedroom.


91
00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:55.559
Both of you.

92
00:09:02.684 --> 00:09:04.248
I ain't much.

93
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.333
25 years
in the coal mines,


94
00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:07.898
carryin' an IWW card.

95
00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:09.287
Now, what am I?

96
00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:11.330
Goddamn railroad
bull, that's what.


97
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.371
Oh, anyhow.

98
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:15.413
Go on in there
with her. She's scared.


99
00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:17.413
Go-
- Go on in.

100
00:09:17.413 --> 00:09:19.280
Yes, sir.
Put your arms around her.


101
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.366
You know how to
treat her, don't you? Yes, sir.


102
00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:22.887
Uh--

103
00:09:22.887 --> 00:09:24.928
She isn't a whore.
You know that, don't ya?


104
00:09:24.928 --> 00:09:26.492
Yes, sir.

105
00:09:26.492 --> 00:09:29.056
Eh, go to bed, son.

106
00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:30.621
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:37.832 --> 00:09:39.873
Son.

108
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:47.998
I see you.

109
00:09:49.562 --> 00:09:51.127
Nice room.

110
00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:58.208
Mike fixed it up
for my graduation.


111
00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.248
Picture's crooked, though.

112
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:11.242
It was my mother's.

113
00:10:17.454 --> 00:10:19.497
Why don't you
take your shoes off?


114
00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:21.018
Okay.

115
00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:09.765
Joe.

116
00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:11.241
Yeah?

117
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:12.806
Could you turn your back?

118
00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.370
Why?

119
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.846
I have to get out of bed.

120
00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:18.757
No. I want to see you.

121
00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.322
I won't let you see me.

122
00:11:20.322 --> 00:11:22.277
Would you get me my robe?

123
00:11:22.277 --> 00:11:23.145
Sure.

124
00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:25.189
It's on the closet
door. It's red.


125
00:11:26.577 --> 00:11:28.488
Okay.

126
00:11:35.615 --> 00:11:37.701
Why'd you do that?

127
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:39.743
Hot night.

128
00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:40.654
Here it is.

129
00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:45.173
Bring it
closer, silly. Uh-uh. Reach for it.


130
00:11:45.173 --> 00:11:47.257
All right, here.
I'll help you.


131
00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.599
Oops.

132
00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:02.160
Let's get it
through here.


133
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.202
There. There you go.

134
00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:09.850
I'll get it right.

135
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.893
Here, let me show you.

136
00:12:10.893 --> 00:12:14.021
Now we got it. There.

137
00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:18.627
Huh?
No.


138
00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:49.387
We should have flowers.
Hm? Sure.


139
00:12:56.816 --> 00:12:59.423
If you really
want to see me--


140
00:12:59.423 --> 00:13:00.987
Oh, if you don't
want me to,


141
00:13:00.987 --> 00:13:02.550
I don't want to, either.

142
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.167
Well, fair is fair.

143
00:13:56.901 --> 00:13:59.378
Okay.

144
00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:32.267
It's nice like this,
isn't it?


145
00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:35.220
Mm-hmm.

146
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.827
Have you ever been this
way with anyone else?


147
00:15:37.827 --> 00:15:39.913
Not with anyone I loved.

148
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.955
I'm glad.

149
00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:44.040
Have you?

150
00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:45.647
You shouldn't
ask that.


151
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:47.169
Why not?

152
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.688
Because I'm a lady.

153
00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:51.643
You're a mick.

154
00:15:51.643 --> 00:15:53.164
No, I've never
been this way


155
00:15:53.164 --> 00:15:55.206
with anyone
else before.


156
00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:57.813
I know.
But you couldn't have known.


157
00:15:57.813 --> 00:15:59.376
Not really.

158
00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:03.373
Joe, I don't
want you to go.


159
00:16:03.373 --> 00:16:06.458
I want you
to run away.


160
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:09.021
You don't want me
to see Paris, France,


161
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:10.586
that's all.

162
00:16:21.794 --> 00:16:24.358
Don't go, Joe.
Please don't go.


163
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.747
Run away.

164
00:16:26.747 --> 00:16:27.791
Where to? Shipyards?

165
00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:29.789
Anywhere.

166
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.614
I'll hide you,
honest I will.


167
00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:34.567
Want me to be
a slacker, huh?


168
00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:36.002
Yes.

169
00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:39.347
Oh, they'll kill you,
Joe. I know they will.


170
00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:42.474
In the words of
that great patriot


171
00:16:42.474 --> 00:16:44.517
Theodore Roosevelt--

172
00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:46.559
I love you, Joe.

173
00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:49.556
Hold me closer.

174
00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:52.163
Put both your arms
around me.


175
00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:54.163
Both of them.

176
00:16:59.723 --> 00:17:01.808
Let us pray.

177
00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:05.328
Our Father--

178
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:12.105
I can't pray like that.

179
00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:14.016
All I can say is
dear God,


180
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.363
don't make him go away.

181
00:17:16.363 --> 00:17:18.883
Don't let him be killed.
I won't be.


182
00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:21.968
All aboard!

183
00:17:23.922 --> 00:17:25.009
All aboard!

184
00:18:44.602 --> 00:18:46.645
<i>Why don't they turn the lights on?</i>

185
00:18:49.468 --> 00:18:51.033
<i>It's dark in here.</i>

186
00:18:54.074 --> 00:18:56.681
<i>It's dark and still,</i>

187
00:18:56.681 --> 00:19:01.285
<i>and I can feel the blood
pumping through my veins.</i>


188
00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:04.240
<i>But I can't hear
the pulse in my ears.</i>


189
00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:09.324
<i>If you can't hear
your own pulse, you're deaf.</i>


190
00:19:09.845 --> 00:19:11.409
<i>You're deaf, Joe.</i>

191
00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:13.451
<i>Deaf.</i>

192
00:19:15.318 --> 00:19:18.925
<i>Maybe not.
Maybe I'm just dreaming.</i>


193
00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:21.401
<i>Maybe-- oh, Jesus
Christ, I hurt!</i>


194
00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:29.656
<i>I can feel the sweat
pouring out of my skin.</i>


195
00:19:29.656 --> 00:19:32.741
<i>Hot, wet skin that's
all covered up with--</i>


196
00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:35.173
<i>with bandages.</i>

197
00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.563
<i>Even my head.</i>

198
00:19:37.563 --> 00:19:40.474
<i>I sure must've
caught a big one.</i>


199
00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.036
<i>No.</i>

200
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:46.079
<i>Telephones in the middle
of the night</i>


201
00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.599
<i>are bad luck.</i>

202
00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:50.553
<i>Don't let anybody
answer it, Father.</i>


203
00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:54.725
<i>What's this? 
Footsteps.</i>

204
00:19:54.725 --> 00:19:57.331
<i>I can feel
their vibrations.</i>


205
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:05.890
<i>What are they doing?</i>

206
00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:09.540
Any evidence of
hypostasis


207
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.582
while aspirating?

208
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:12.581
None thus far.

209
00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:20.922
<i>They're looking
at something.</i>


210
00:20:20.922 --> 00:20:22.487
Trachea tube clear.

211
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.440
<i>A hand on my chest.</i>

212
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.048
He's breathing well.

213
00:20:30.655 --> 00:20:33.783
No more oxygen unless
an emergency develops.


214
00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:37.433
<i>I don't understand that.</i>

215
00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.429
Can you lift for
intravenous feeling?


216
00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:40.951
Good.

217
00:20:43.037 --> 00:20:44.601
<i>My face.</i>

218
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:46.077
<i>Is something wrong
with my face?</i>


219
00:20:46.077 --> 00:20:47.599
Skin grafts will
be necessary here.


220
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.726
Colostomy good.

221
00:20:51.726 --> 00:20:54.202
Cystotomy functioning?

222
00:20:54.202 --> 00:20:55.767
Uh-huh.
Very good.


223
00:20:55.767 --> 00:20:56.723
<i>What next?</i>

224
00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:58.286
Is the ambulance
ready? Yes, sir.


225
00:20:58.286 --> 00:20:59.850
Very well.
Bring him along.


226
00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.936
Where are you
taking him, sir?


227
00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:04.455
Occupation forces
base hospital


228
00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:06.889
number 3 at
Jeanville St. Clears.


229
00:21:09.496 --> 00:21:12.623
All right.
Let's move it.


230
00:21:12.623 --> 00:21:13.709
<i>David's Perfection Bakery.</i>

231
00:21:13.709 --> 00:21:14.752
<i>Rudy McKenna speaking.</i>

232
00:21:14.752 --> 00:21:16.316
<i>It's Rudy.</i>

233
00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:17.359
<i>Telephone, Joe.</i>

234
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.923
<i>Okay, coming.</i>

235
00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:25.615
Hello.

236
00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:35.476
Yes, Mother.
I'll be right home.


237
00:21:46.382 --> 00:21:48.293
Thank you.
I'll let you know


238
00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:50.422
when everything's
finished, okay? Okay, Joe.


239
00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:52.507
I'll be back to work
in a couple days.


240
00:21:52.507 --> 00:21:56.026
That's all right.
Rest up. Good night.


241
00:24:12.795 --> 00:24:15.401
I'm sorry, Father.

242
00:24:16.965 --> 00:24:20.137
I'm sorry I lost
your fishing pole, too.


243
00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:24.264
I loved you.

244
00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:41.382
<i>Well, the bandages
are off my arm.</i>


245
00:24:41.904 --> 00:24:43.468
<i>It itches.</i>

246
00:24:43.468 --> 00:24:45.553
<i>I wish they'd
scratch it.</i>


247
00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:48.681
<i>What happens now?</i>

248
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:51.201
Yes, we can remove
the sutures.


249
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:54.372
Let's disinfect.

250
00:24:54.372 --> 00:24:56.458
<i>I wish they'd get
this stuff off my face</i>


251
00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:58.543
<i>so I could see
what they're doing.</i>


252
00:24:58.543 --> 00:25:00.108
Sorry, sir.
Another.


253
00:25:10.448 --> 00:25:11.925
<i>Ouch!</i>

254
00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:12.924
<i>They're pinching me.</i>

255
00:25:12.924 --> 00:25:15.445
<i>No, it's more like a--</i>

256
00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:18.485
<i>a little stab of heat.</i>

257
00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:20.528
<i>Wait a minute.
I know.</i>


258
00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:21.962
<i>It's just like when
I ran into</i>


259
00:25:21.962 --> 00:25:23.959
<i>the barbed-wire fence
and cut my eyebrow.</i>


260
00:25:23.959 --> 00:25:25.784
<i>They sew you up,
and then it heals,</i>


261
00:25:26.305 --> 00:25:28.391
<i>and then they take
the stitches out.</i>


262
00:25:28.912 --> 00:25:31.867
<i>Only-- Well, only
this is different.</i>


263
00:25:31.867 --> 00:25:33.952
<i>I can feel what they're
doing to my arm,</i>


264
00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:36.516
<i>but I can't feel the end
of my arm at all.</i>


265
00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:38.602
<i>The nearest thing
to the end of my arm</i>


266
00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:39.991
<i>is the heel of my hand.</i>

267
00:25:39.991 --> 00:25:44.727
<i>The heel of my hand,
the end of my arm.</i>


268
00:25:44.727 --> 00:25:46.812
<i>It's too high.</i>

269
00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:48.898
<i>It's high
as my shoulder.</i>


270
00:25:48.898 --> 00:25:52.026
<i>You've cut off my arm!
The tissues have closed.</i>


271
00:25:52.026 --> 00:25:53.591
<i>My arm! Oh, my God.
Remove the wrist.</i>


272
00:25:54.112 --> 00:25:55.458
<i>Why did you do
a thing like that?</i>


273
00:25:55.632 --> 00:25:56.762
<i>I need that arm.</i>

274
00:25:56.762 --> 00:25:59.369
<i>Oh, I've gotta
work with it. I--</i>


275
00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:03.018
<i>You can't go around
cutting a man's arm off,</i>


276
00:26:03.018 --> 00:26:06.624
<i>like you were pruning
dead branches off a tree!</i>


277
00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:09.752
<i>Well, there's
a law or something!</i>


278
00:26:09.752 --> 00:26:10.795
<i>You've gotta get
his consent</i>


279
00:26:10.795 --> 00:26:12.272
<i>before you do
a thing like that.</i>


280
00:26:12.793 --> 00:26:13.836
<i>He's gotta sign a paper</i>

281
00:26:13.836 --> 00:26:15.400
<i>because a man
with only one arm</i>


282
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.791
<i>is a cripple, and--
and all he can do</i>


283
00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:19.223
<i>is go around
selling pencils!</i>


284
00:26:24.957 --> 00:26:28.173
<i>Oh, no!
Not my other arm, too!</i>


285
00:26:28.477 --> 00:26:30.129
<i>No, no! Please, no.</i>

286
00:26:30.129 --> 00:26:31.127
<i>You've already taken
one of my arms--</i>


287
00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:33.734
I want him moved to
the least conspicuous room


288
00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:36.863
you can find,
for his own good.


289
00:26:36.863 --> 00:26:38.949
A room with a lock
and something over the windows


290
00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:39.990
so they can't peer
in at him.


291
00:26:40.511 --> 00:26:42.902
There isn't a decent
unoccupied room in the building.


292
00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:44.467
Utility room?
Supply room?


293
00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:45.682
Store room? Anything.

294
00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:47.246
He can't tell
the difference.


295
00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:49.331
Put someone
in here who can.


296
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.015
<i>There's a game out there,</i>

297
00:27:07.015 --> 00:27:09.622
<i>and the stakes are high.</i>

298
00:27:09.622 --> 00:27:12.229
<i>And the guy who runs it
figures the averages</i>


299
00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:14.835
<i>all day long
and all night long.</i>


300
00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:18.484
<i>Once in a while,
he lets you steal a pot.</i>


301
00:27:18.484 --> 00:27:21.134
<i>But if you stay
in the game long enough,</i>


302
00:27:21.655 --> 00:27:23.220
<i>you've got to lose.</i>

303
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.390
<i>And once you've lost,
there's no way back.</i>


304
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.738
<i>No way at all.</i>

305
00:27:28.954 --> 00:27:30.606
Hit me.

306
00:27:32.605 --> 00:27:34.688
Pay 20.

307
00:27:34.688 --> 00:27:38.339
Christ, I sure could
do with a shot of whiskey.


308
00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:39.902
Help yourself.

309
00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:43.379
Bets down.

310
00:27:44.899 --> 00:27:46.333
How'd you learn that?

311
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:48.896
I used to do it
at weddings.


312
00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:50.461
Hey, can you do
card tricks, too?


313
00:27:50.982 --> 00:27:51.982
Sure.

314
00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:58.238
Cards to the gamblers.

315
00:27:59.802 --> 00:28:01.843
Hit me.

316
00:28:01.843 --> 00:28:03.972
I'm just fine.

317
00:28:03.972 --> 00:28:05.015
Boy, I'm just fine.

318
00:28:05.015 --> 00:28:06.058
Hit me.

319
00:28:07.578 --> 00:28:09.619
Stan?

320
00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:11.662
Hit me,
but not too hard.


321
00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:12.661
Now, watch him get 21.

322
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:19.265
Pay 21.

323
00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:21.264
It's a funny thing,

324
00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:22.741
I can do
almost everything


325
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:24.739
but hit a 12.

326
00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:26.217
12 shouldn't be
any harder to hit


327
00:28:26.217 --> 00:28:27.215
then a 13, should it?

328
00:28:27.215 --> 00:28:28.780
Shouldn't be, but it is.

329
00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.213
That's nothing
but superstition.


330
00:28:31.213 --> 00:28:33.168
A 12 to hit
is just the same


331
00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:34.602
as any other
number above it,


332
00:28:34.602 --> 00:28:36.123
only better.

333
00:28:36.123 --> 00:28:39.597
Don't let anybody
tell you different.


334
00:28:42.118 --> 00:28:43.682
Assembly. What time
is it anyhow?


335
00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:46.244
Three Christmases
and 41 days.


336
00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:49.331
Time to go.

337
00:28:49.331 --> 00:28:52.240
If I don't make
that train, I miss--


338
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.761
I miss a date to be killed

339
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:55.282
on the 27th of June

340
00:28:55.282 --> 00:28:57.412
at 4:30 a.m.
in the morning.


341
00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:00.018
Not too good
for my kid, huh?


342
00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.060
He's only a year,
eight months,


343
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.102
and smart as hell
already.


344
00:29:05.448 --> 00:29:07.360
Sure wish I could see
him when he was 5.


345
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.792
You'll see him
when he's 50.


346
00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:13.355
And you'll still be 23.

347
00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:15.138
What the hell?
We're all gonna be killed.


348
00:29:15.138 --> 00:29:16.180
That's what we're here for.

349
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.743
He's already got his.

350
00:29:19.134 --> 00:29:21.784
And the big Swede here,
he's gonna catch flu


351
00:29:22.307 --> 00:29:23.782
and die on shipboard.

352
00:29:25.868 --> 00:29:27.954
I'm gonna get buried
in a trench cave-in


353
00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:28.996
and smothered to death.

354
00:29:28.996 --> 00:29:31.516
Now, isn't that
a hell of way to go?


355
00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:33.602
Jeez.

356
00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:36.209
All aboard!

357
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:38.641
Next stop, New York,

358
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:41.813
Atlantic Ocean,
and Paris, France!


359
00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:42.813
What's this guy doing here?

360
00:29:42.813 --> 00:29:45.332
He ain't gonna get killed.

361
00:29:45.332 --> 00:29:46.852
Leave him alone.
He's all right.


362
00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:48.764
Come on, boys.
On your feet.


363
00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:50.329
We've got to make
that train.


364
00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:51.371
Are you going with us?

365
00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:54.369
Of course. I've got
lots of trains to handle.


366
00:29:54.369 --> 00:29:55.976
Lots of dead men.

367
00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.539
So many dead men,

368
00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:00.147
you wouldn't believe it.

369
00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:34.165
Not my legs! Not my legs, too!

370
00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:36.772
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

371
00:30:36.772 --> 00:30:39.900
<i>Not my legs, too.</i>

372
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.506
<i>Help me, somebody.</i>

373
00:30:42.506 --> 00:30:44.592
<i>Help me.</i>

374
00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:48.764
<i>Don't let them
cut my legs off.</i>


375
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:52.934
<i>Don't let them take my legs, too.</i>

376
00:31:00.451 --> 00:31:02.537
<i>Jesus.</i>

377
00:31:02.537 --> 00:31:05.664
<i>They just went ahead
and chopped off everything.</i>


378
00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:07.792
<i>Of course,
it's a lot cheaper</i>


379
00:31:07.792 --> 00:31:10.921
<i>to cut a leg off
than fix it up.</i>


380
00:31:10.921 --> 00:31:15.091
<i>With a war going on,
they haven't got much time.</i>


381
00:31:15.091 --> 00:31:17.177
<i>Everybody is tired.</i>

382
00:31:19.263 --> 00:31:21.870
<i>But, what kind of doctor
would cut a man down</i>


383
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.433
<i>to what I am now</i>

384
00:31:23.433 --> 00:31:24.997
<i>and still let him live?</i>

385
00:31:27.604 --> 00:31:29.690
<i>Do they have a bet on?</i>

386
00:31:31.253 --> 00:31:33.860
<i>Were they showing off
or something?</i>


387
00:31:35.424 --> 00:31:37.510
<i>Was it some kind
of experiment?</i>


388
00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:41.680
<i>No.</i>

389
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.810
<i>Nobody would do
a thing like that</i>


390
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.895
<i>to another man.</i>

391
00:31:45.895 --> 00:31:50.066
<i>Nobody could be
such a butcher.</i>


392
00:31:50.066 --> 00:31:51.108
My dear students,

393
00:31:51.543 --> 00:31:55.106
war has various meanings

394
00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.757
to various persons.

395
00:31:56.757 --> 00:31:58.321
To the scientist,

396
00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:01.883
war means that he
is actually set free


397
00:32:01.883 --> 00:32:04.838
to accomplish
his most brilliant


398
00:32:04.838 --> 00:32:07.488
and most imaginative
enterprises.


399
00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:08.531
For example,

400
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:11.007
in previous wars,

401
00:32:11.007 --> 00:32:13.962
each injury has resulted

402
00:32:13.962 --> 00:32:16.959
in a very serious loss
to the taxpayers,


403
00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:20.349
the loss of a most
expensively trained soldier--


404
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:23.129
or fighting unit,
as we call him now.


405
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:25.127
However, in the next war,

406
00:32:25.127 --> 00:32:26.995
we shall be able to repair

407
00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:30.080
and deliver that
same fighting unit


408
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.514
to the frontline trenches

409
00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:33.860
in three weeks
or even less.


410
00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.467
And all because

411
00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:39.421
of the radical
new techniques


412
00:32:39.421 --> 00:32:42.462
which this young man
has taught us.


413
00:32:42.462 --> 00:32:45.634
<i>I'm having a nightmare
that says I'm real.</i>


414
00:32:45.634 --> 00:32:48.242
<i>Wake me up, Mother,
and tell me I'm not real.</i>


415
00:32:48.762 --> 00:32:51.195
<i>I don't know where you are, my son,</i>

416
00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:52.715
<i>or what troubles you.</i>

417
00:32:52.715 --> 00:32:56.278
<i>Try to remember that God
is the only reality,</i>


418
00:32:56.278 --> 00:32:59.841
<i>and that you are made
in his image and likeness.</i>


419
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:01.926
<i>And since you are
the perfect reflection</i>


420
00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:03.882
<i>of God's reality,</i>

421
00:33:04.403 --> 00:33:05.401
<i>you are real.</i>

422
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:06.966
<i>You're wrong, Mother.</i>

423
00:33:06.966 --> 00:33:09.052
<i>It's a dream.</i>

424
00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:10.615
<i>It's got to be.</i>

425
00:33:11.136 --> 00:33:13.744
<i>Everything else
is true, but not this.</i>


426
00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:17.828
<i>No, I remember
the real things, Mother.</i>


427
00:33:17.828 --> 00:33:22.997
<i>Even before we left Colorado
and moved to Los Angeles.</i>


428
00:33:22.997 --> 00:33:25.083
<i>I remember everything.</i>

429
00:33:25.083 --> 00:33:26.082
Ouch.

430
00:33:26.082 --> 00:33:27.604
You hurt yourself,
son?


431
00:33:27.604 --> 00:33:30.210
Uh-uh.
Let's see.


432
00:33:33.251 --> 00:33:35.336
Oh, honestly.

433
00:33:35.336 --> 00:33:38.855
Someday those feet
are gonna get so dirty,


434
00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:41.374
they'll
never wash clean.


435
00:34:19.217 --> 00:34:22.779
From now on, I'm gonna
take my baths at the YMCA,


436
00:34:22.779 --> 00:34:25.214
the way Daddy does.

437
00:34:41.853 --> 00:34:45.197
For behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy


438
00:34:45.197 --> 00:34:48.195
that shall be
to all people.


439
00:34:48.195 --> 00:34:50.803
For unto you is
born this day


440
00:34:50.803 --> 00:34:53.930
in the city of David,
a savior,


441
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.537
which is Christ the Lord.

442
00:34:56.537 --> 00:34:59.622
And suddenly there was
with the angel--


443
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.177
See those rocks
over there?


444
00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:13.525
A long time ago,
they caught


445
00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:16.392
a hunting party
of Ute Indians there.


446
00:35:16.392 --> 00:35:20.042
Know what they did?
Rounded 'em up,


447
00:35:20.042 --> 00:35:22.431
tied rocks around their feet,
and threw 'em in the lake.


448
00:35:23.866 --> 00:35:25.950
About where we are now.

449
00:35:26.255 --> 00:35:31.033
The, uh, fishing on this
side of the lake's been good ever since.


450
00:35:37.377 --> 00:35:39.506
<i>Science and Health
with Key to the Scriptures,</i>


451
00:35:39.506 --> 00:35:41.070
by Mary Baker Eddy.

452
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.676

<i>There is no more reality</i>

<i>than there is to
the dream we have in sleep.</i>


466
00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:25.516
<i>Reality is God.</i>

467
00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:28.123
<i>And the essence
of God is love--</i>


468
00:36:28.123 --> 00:36:29.685
<i>that perfect love</i>

469
00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:31.250
<i>which banishes all fear</i>

470
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.117
<i>and heals all wounds.</i>

471
00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:36.594
<i>Stop it. I don't
want to hear anymore</i>


472
00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.680
<i>about God is love.
Prepare an injection.</i>


473

<i>Because If I do,
I'll begin to hate him.</i>


474

When did you
aspirate him last? 4:30.


475
00:36:41.807 --> 00:36:43.372
Gavage feeding?

476
00:36:43.372 --> 00:36:45.458
2:00 and again at 4.

477
00:36:53.799 --> 00:36:55.885
<i>No, no.
Don't put me under again.</i>


478

00:37:03.184 --> 00:37:05.791
<i>I'm in terrible trouble,
and I need help.</i>


481
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:08.397
<i>Father?
Did you hear me?</i>


482
00:37:08.397 --> 00:37:09.917
Father?

483
00:37:09.917 --> 00:37:12.959
I hear ya, son. But I
got troubles of my own.


484
00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:18.389
Nothing I have in this world
is really any good, you know?


485
00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:21.474
My house is small.
My job is small.


486
00:37:21.474 --> 00:37:24.906
My salary is also small.

487
00:37:24.906 --> 00:37:29.207
Son is small.
So is my wife,


488
00:37:29.207 --> 00:37:31.640
and get right down to it,
I'm no giant, myself.


489
00:37:32.682 --> 00:37:34.768
Everything
around me is small,


490
00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.332
inferior,

491
00:37:37.332 --> 00:37:40.893
except this fishing pole.

492
00:37:41.807 --> 00:37:44.457
I, myself,
wind it every year


493
00:37:44.457 --> 00:37:46.326
with the best
of silk thread.


494
00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:48.322
See this lacquer?

495
00:37:48.801 --> 00:37:51.278
Comes from China.

496
00:37:51.278 --> 00:37:53.275
No finer lacquer
in the world.


497
00:37:58.489 --> 00:37:59.967
See those guides?

498
00:37:59.967 --> 00:38:01.444
Pure amber.

499
00:38:03.442 --> 00:38:05.485
Nobody in town has
a fishing pole like this.


500
00:38:06.006 --> 00:38:08.613
Not even Mr. Ladamer
down at the bank.


501
00:38:10.177 --> 00:38:12.263
My life is so poor
and shoddy


502
00:38:12.263 --> 00:38:14.739
that without this pole,
why,


503
00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:18.258
I'd have nothing to set me
apart from other men.


504
00:38:18.258 --> 00:38:21.951
Nothing to give me distinction,
nothing at all.


505
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:26.469
That's why
I love it so much.


506
00:38:26.469 --> 00:38:29.076
Do you love it more
than you love me?


507
00:38:29.554 --> 00:38:31.118
'Course I do.

508
00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:34.507
What is there about you
that can give a man distinction?


509
00:38:34.507 --> 00:38:36.505
You're not unusual at all.

510
00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:38.503
Yes I am, Father.

511
00:38:38.503 --> 00:38:40.286
How's that?

512
00:38:40.503 --> 00:38:42.588
I may not be
unusual now,


513
00:38:42.588 --> 00:38:44.846
but I'm going to be.

514
00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:47.236
Of course you are.

515
00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:49.756
You're gonna make the world
safe for democracy, aren't ya?


516
00:38:50.148 --> 00:38:51.668
What is democracy?

517
00:38:55.752 --> 00:38:57.708
Well, I was never very
clear on it, myself.


518
00:38:59.836 --> 00:39:02.399
Like every other
kind of government,


519
00:39:02.399 --> 00:39:04.788
it's got something to do
with young men


520
00:39:04.788 --> 00:39:06.266
killing each other,
I believe.


521
00:39:07.656 --> 00:39:09.741
Why don't old men
kill each other?


522
00:39:09.741 --> 00:39:11.176
Well, the old men
are needed


523
00:39:11.176 --> 00:39:13.174
to keep the home
fires burning.


524
00:39:13.174 --> 00:39:16.171
Couldn't the young men
do that just as well?


525
00:39:16.171 --> 00:39:18.517
Young men don't have homes.

526
00:39:18.517 --> 00:39:20.472
That's why they must go out
and kill each other.


527
00:39:22.037 --> 00:39:25.208
When it comes my turn,

528
00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:26.642
will you want me to go?

529
00:39:28.597 --> 00:39:30.638
For democracy,

530
00:39:30.638 --> 00:39:33.637
any man would give
his only begotten son.


531
00:39:34.984 --> 00:39:35.897
I wouldn't.

532
00:39:44.976 --> 00:39:47.062
I won't be here
to stop you, Joe.


533
00:39:53.317 --> 00:39:54.882
Put your arms around me.

534
00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:57.663
I need their warmth

535
00:39:57.663 --> 00:40:00.486
to keep the chill
of death away.


536
00:40:02.355 --> 00:40:03.311
I can't.

537
00:40:06.743 --> 00:40:08.741
Please?

538
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:10.306
No!

539
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:20.298
Well...

540
00:40:20.298 --> 00:40:21.341
I guess it always
comes down to that.


541
00:40:23.947 --> 00:40:26.554
Each man faces
death by himself.


542
00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:29.553
Alone.

543
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.985
From now on, it's
a simple matter


544
00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:32.334
of good nursing care,

545
00:40:33.636 --> 00:40:35.678
I can always be
reached at GHQ


546
00:40:35.678 --> 00:40:37.155
if anything develops.

547
00:40:37.155 --> 00:40:39.589
Let's try the mask.

548
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:41.152
<i>Thank God. They're
finally getting</i>


549
00:40:41.152 --> 00:40:43.195
<i>this stuff off my face.</i>

550
00:40:43.195 --> 00:40:44.193
<i>The air feels good.</i>

551
00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:46.279
<i>Feels cool.</i>

552
00:40:49.276 --> 00:40:51.797
Repairs seem to
have healed well.


553
00:40:54.403 --> 00:40:56.489
<i>What's this?</i>

554
00:40:56.489 --> 00:40:58.054
You see?

555
00:40:58.054 --> 00:40:59.617
Works very well.

556
00:40:59.617 --> 00:41:01.182
Any questions?

557
00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:04.135
Good luck.

558
00:41:04.135 --> 00:41:05.700
<i>It's better.</i>

559
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.264
<i>It does let
the air in.</i>


560
00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:09.348
<i>But I thought when
they unbandaged my face,</i>


561
00:41:09.348 --> 00:41:11.390
<i>I'd be all healed.</i>

562
00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:29.725
<i>She's cleaning
my breathing tube.</i>


563
00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:33.071
<i>I thought when they took
this stuff off my face,</i>


564
00:41:33.071 --> 00:41:35.852
<i>they'd take
the tubes out, too.</i>


565
00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:38.892
<i>But they didn't.</i>

566
00:41:38.892 --> 00:41:40.413
<i>I don't understand.</i>

567
00:41:42.498 --> 00:41:44.584
<i>Where is she going now?</i>

568
00:41:56.445 --> 00:41:58.008
<i>Oh, yes. I know.</i>

569
00:42:00.616 --> 00:42:03.525
<i>I've still got
my feeding tube.</i>


570
00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:07.914
<i>When am I gonna
be able to feed myself?</i>


571
00:42:08.436 --> 00:42:10.521
<i>When am I going to get well?</i>

572
00:42:16.518 --> 00:42:18.384
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

573
00:42:18.384 --> 00:42:21.339
<i>But it won't always
be like this, will it?</i>


574
00:42:21.557 --> 00:42:23.728
<i>Now wait.</i>

575
00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:26.770
<i>Think for a minute.</i>

576
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:27.813
<i>There's something
funny here--</i>


577
00:42:27.813 --> 00:42:29.812
<i>something cool,
something wet.</i>


578
00:42:29.812 --> 00:42:31.897
<i>I thought my face
was just wrapped up,</i>


579
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:33.938
<i>when they unwrapped it,
I could--</i>


580
00:42:34.417 --> 00:42:37.414
<i>Oh. Oh, please, I--</i>

581
00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:39.370
<i>Now, get a hold
of yourself, Joe.</i>


582
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.454
<i>Don't lose your head.</i>

583
00:42:41.454 --> 00:42:42.888
<i>Your jaws.</i>

584
00:42:42.888 --> 00:42:44.453
<i>You can't move your jaws.</i>

585
00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:49.667
<i>They don't work.</i>

586
00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.273
<i>You haven't got any.</i>

587
00:42:51.273 --> 00:42:53.229
<i>Well, take your tongue, rub
it around inside your teeth</i>


588
00:42:53.229 --> 00:42:55.315
<i>like you were chasing
a raspberry seed.</i>


589
00:42:56.878 --> 00:42:59.398
<i>I-
- I haven't got any tongue!</i>

590
00:42:59.398 --> 00:43:02.266
<i>I-- I haven't got
any teeth for it to feel.</i>


591
00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:05.394
<i>I haven't got anything
here but a hole.</i>


592
00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:06.783
<i>How big is it?</i>

593
00:43:06.783 --> 00:43:09.390
<i>How-
- How does it go?</i>

594
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.520
<i>Now don't panic.</i>

595
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.127
<i>Think.</i>

596
00:43:15.127 --> 00:43:18.775
<i>Inside of the hole is--
is wet.</i>


597
00:43:18.775 --> 00:43:21.817
<i>The edges of it are dry.</i>

598
00:43:21.817 --> 00:43:23.337
<i>Wet, dry.</i>

599
00:43:23.337 --> 00:43:25.119
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

600
00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.073
<i>Now, figure out
where it's dry.</i>


601
00:43:27.073 --> 00:43:29.116
<i>Feel. Yes.</i>

602
00:43:29.593 --> 00:43:31.071
<i>I'm feeling.</i>

603
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:34.980
<i>Dry-- And shouldn't
the hole go up?</i>


604
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.501
<i>Up.</i>

605
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:38.891
<i>No eyes.</i>

606
00:43:38.891 --> 00:43:40.412
<i>I haven't got any eyes</i>

607
00:43:40.412 --> 00:43:41.889
<i>or mouth or teeth,
tongue, or nose.</i>


608
00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:42.932
<i>I haven't gotten anything,</i>

609
00:43:42.932 --> 00:43:45.017
<i>but my whole face
is scooped out!</i>


610
00:43:45.017 --> 00:43:48.015
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's me, and I'm alive!</i>


611
00:43:48.015 --> 00:43:49.449
<i>Oh, no. It can't be!</i>

612
00:43:49.969 --> 00:43:53.010
<i>Not me! I--
I can't live like this!</i>


613
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.575
<i>I-
- I can't.</i>

614
00:43:54.575 --> 00:43:56.052
<i>Please, no, I can't--
I can't!</i>


615
00:43:56.052 --> 00:43:57.572
<i>Help me. Somebody
please help me.</i>


616
00:43:57.572 --> 00:44:00.136
<i>Mother, where are ya?</i>

617
00:44:00.136 --> 00:44:01.701
<i>Help me, Mother.
I'm having a nightmare</i>


618
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:03.656
<i>and I can't wake up.</i>

619
00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:07.305
<i>If you don't wake me up
I'll be like this for years</i>


620
00:44:07.305 --> 00:44:08.260
<i>and years</i>

621
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.215
<i>and years</i>

622
00:44:17.644 --> 00:44:21.208
<i>Pray for me, please.</i>

623
00:44:21.208 --> 00:44:23.815
<i>Please, pray for me.</i>

624
00:44:23.815 --> 00:44:27.463
To all those
in the armed forces


625
00:44:27.463 --> 00:44:31.635
who sacrificed
their young lives


626
00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:35.284
in this just and holy war

627
00:44:35.284 --> 00:44:38.412
for everlasting peace,

628
00:44:38.412 --> 00:44:44.147
I grant absolution
of all their sins.


629
00:44:44.147 --> 00:44:45.711
In the name of the Father

630
00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:47.275
and of the Son

631
00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.447
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.


632
00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:52.532
Let us pray.

633
00:45:00.613 --> 00:45:02.699
<i>A place like this,
you've gotta think</i>


634
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:06.390
<i>in order to keep
from thinking.</i>


635
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.955
<i>There are eight planets,</i>

636
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:11.474
<i>Earth, Venus,</i>

637
00:45:11.474 --> 00:45:13.908
<i>Mars, Jupiter,</i>

638
00:45:14.385 --> 00:45:18.382
<i>Mercury--
What's that?</i>


639
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.903
<i>There's something
chewing on my forehead.</i>


640
00:45:22.901 --> 00:45:24.421
<i>It's a rat!</i>

641
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.986
<i>It's one of those great
big fat trench rats.</i>


642
00:45:25.986 --> 00:45:29.504
<i>Help me, somebody.
Kill it!</i>


643
00:45:29.504 --> 00:45:32.068
<i>No, couldn't be a rat.</i>

644
00:45:32.547 --> 00:45:34.066
<i>They wouldn't let
rats run around</i>


645
00:45:34.066 --> 00:45:36.022
<i>chewing up the customers
in a place like this.</i>


646
00:45:36.587 --> 00:45:38.151
<i>It's a dream.</i>

647
00:45:39.715 --> 00:45:40.758
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

648
00:45:40.758 --> 00:45:42.321
<i>It is a rat.</i>

649
00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:44.884
<i>It's crawling.
It's crawling.</i>


650
00:45:44.884 --> 00:45:46.884
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

651
00:45:46.884 --> 00:45:49.794
<i>Don't--
Don't let it get me.</i>


652
00:45:49.794 --> 00:45:52.618
<i>No. No, no. 
No, no, no.</i>

653
00:45:52.618 --> 00:45:56.138
<i>He's close.</i>

654
00:45:56.138 --> 00:45:58.180
<i>He's on my chest.</i>

655
00:45:58.701 --> 00:46:00.700
<i>Don't even scare him.</i>

656
00:46:02.263 --> 00:46:04.696
<i>Hold still and he will--</i>

657
00:46:07.433 --> 00:46:08.953
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

658
00:46:08.953 --> 00:46:10.387
<i>Did somebody kill it?</i>

659
00:46:10.387 --> 00:46:12.255
<i>Or did it just go away?</i>

660
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.600
<i>What if it comes back?</i>

661
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.122
<i>It was a dream.</i>

662
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:19.599
<i>It had to be.</i>

663
00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:21.164
<i>But how can you tell</i>

664
00:46:21.684 --> 00:46:22.726
<i>what's a dream
and what's real</i>


665
00:46:22.726 --> 00:46:24.725
<i>when you can't even
tell when you're awake</i>


666
00:46:24.725 --> 00:46:26.289
<i>and when you're asleep?</i>

667
00:46:27.679 --> 00:46:29.200
<i>Or maybe the rat's real</i>

668
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.720
<i>and the nurse here
is a dream.</i>


669
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.587
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,
how can I ever be able to tell the difference?</i>


670
00:46:35.587 --> 00:46:38.671
The thing to do is yell.

671
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:41.757
Sometimes, even now,
I have this old dream


672
00:46:42.278 --> 00:46:43.842
that somebody
wants to kill me.


673
00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:45.405
And my mother and father
are running away


674
00:46:45.405 --> 00:46:47.317
with me to Egypt.

675
00:46:47.317 --> 00:46:49.403
I hear the sound of
soldiers riding at night


676
00:46:49.403 --> 00:46:51.271
and the screams.

677
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:52.660
And I yell.

678
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.790
And the yell wakes me up.

679
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:57.310
And then I know
that it's a dream.


680
00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.308
So what you have
to do is yell.


681
00:46:59.308 --> 00:47:01.393
But, you see,
I can't yell.


682
00:47:01.915 --> 00:47:04.000
I can't even whisper.

683
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.129
Well, whispering
wouldn't help anyhow.


684
00:47:07.129 --> 00:47:11.299
Another way is just
to tell yourself


685
00:47:11.299 --> 00:47:15.992
"Wait a minute, here.
This is a nightmare.


686
00:47:15.992 --> 00:47:18.511
"And I have to wake up
in order to stop it."


687
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:19.555
Then just force
your eyes open,


688
00:47:19.989 --> 00:47:21.640
and the dream
will be gone.


689
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.072
Oh, I can't open my eyes.
I haven't got any.


690
00:47:29.634 --> 00:47:31.457
Well, that complicates things.

691
00:47:33.543 --> 00:47:35.065
Maybe the thing to do

692
00:47:35.065 --> 00:47:38.105
is police your mind
before you go to sleep.


693
00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:40.191
Say to yourself,

694
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.755
"I'm going to sleep now.

695
00:47:42.755 --> 00:47:46.186
"And I'm not going
to have any nightmares."


696
00:47:46.186 --> 00:47:48.619
Could be done, you know?
With practice.


697
00:47:52.139 --> 00:47:54.006
You feel yourself
getting drowsy--


698
00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:55.919
I never feel drowsy.

699
00:47:55.962 --> 00:47:57.874
I haven't got anything
to feel drowsy with.


700
00:48:00.784 --> 00:48:02.609
Nothing?

701
00:48:40.537 --> 00:48:42.623
Maybe we should

702
00:48:42.623 --> 00:48:44.145
take a different
line of attack,


703
00:48:44.145 --> 00:48:45.664
altogether.

704
00:48:45.664 --> 00:48:48.663
Let us begin
by assuming


705
00:48:48.663 --> 00:48:50.052
that everything
is a dream,


706
00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:52.486
which by and large,
it is.


707
00:48:52.486 --> 00:48:53.962
When we're awake,
we have one kind of dream.


708
00:48:54.483 --> 00:48:55.439
When we're asleep,
we have another.


709
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:57.569
The difference is

710
00:48:57.569 --> 00:48:59.655
that we control
our daydreams.


711
00:48:59.655 --> 00:49:01.652
And the dream
that comes at night


712
00:49:01.652 --> 00:49:04.259
controls us.

713
00:49:04.259 --> 00:49:06.866
Now think about that.

714
00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:10.515
When you dream that
the rat is there,


715
00:49:10.515 --> 00:49:13.122
do you control the dream?

716
00:49:13.122 --> 00:49:14.687
Or does the dream
control you?


717
00:49:14.687 --> 00:49:16.164
It controls me.

718
00:49:16.599 --> 00:49:18.640
Yes, exactly.

719
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.204
If the rat
were really there,


720
00:49:20.204 --> 00:49:22.203
you'd knock it off,
wouldn't you?


721
00:49:22.203 --> 00:49:23.679
Of course.

722
00:49:23.679 --> 00:49:25.679
So the fact that
you don't knock it off


723
00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:28.329
proves that
it really is a dream.


724
00:49:28.329 --> 00:49:30.718
Yes, yes.

725
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.325
I--

726
00:49:33.325 --> 00:49:35.758
That doesn't work.

727
00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:38.712
Even if the rat was real,
I couldn't knock it off


728
00:49:38.712 --> 00:49:40.103
because I haven't
got any arms.


729
00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:44.491
No arms.

730
00:49:44.491 --> 00:49:46.576
I haven't got anything.

731
00:49:46.576 --> 00:49:48.574
I'm just like a piece of meat

732
00:49:49.095 --> 00:49:50.617
that keeps on living.

733
00:49:56.221 --> 00:49:59.261
Since your real life--

734
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:01.608
is a greater nightmare
than your dreams,


735
00:50:03.129 --> 00:50:04.605
it would be cruel

736
00:50:04.605 --> 00:50:08.300
to pretend that anyone
could help you.


737
00:50:10.819 --> 00:50:12.383
What you need is a miracle.

738
00:50:12.383 --> 00:50:13.948
No, not a miracle.

739
00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:16.033
Just tell me
that the rat is real.


740
00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:19.161
And the way I am now
is a dream.


741
00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:20.725
Perhaps it would be
better for you


742
00:50:20.725 --> 00:50:22.289
to go away now.

743
00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:23.853
You're a very
unlucky young man,


744
00:50:23.853 --> 00:50:25.418
and sometimes
it rubs off.


745
00:50:25.418 --> 00:50:28.024
I'll go, but first
tell me just one thing.


746
00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:30.631
Are you and I
really here together?


747
00:50:31.152 --> 00:50:32.759
Or is this
a dream, too?


748
00:50:32.759 --> 00:50:34.323
It's a dream.
How do you know?


749
00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:37.494
Because I'm a dream.
I don't believe you.


750
00:50:37.494 --> 00:50:40.579
Nobody does.

751
00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:43.099
That's why I'm as unreal

752
00:50:43.099 --> 00:50:46.098
as every other dream
that didn't come true.


753
00:50:51.486 --> 00:50:53.048
<i>I don't know whether
I'm alive and dreaming</i>


754
00:50:53.048 --> 00:50:55.090
<i>or dead and remembering.</i>

755
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.090
<i>Am I getting old?</i>

756
00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.654
<i>Is my hair turning gray?</i>

757
00:50:58.654 --> 00:51:01.260
<i>Will anybody ever
come to visit me?</i>


758
00:51:01.782 --> 00:51:03.172
<i>I hope not.</i>

759
00:51:03.172 --> 00:51:04.649
<i>I really wouldn't
want anybody</i>


760
00:51:04.649 --> 00:51:07.126
<i>to see me like this.</i>

761
00:51:07.126 --> 00:51:10.123
<i>I do get homesick, though.</i>

762
00:51:10.123 --> 00:51:12.730
<i>Oh, but they wouldn't
have shipped me that long way home.</i>


763
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.337
<i>Not with all these
tubes and things in me.</i>


764
00:51:15.858 --> 00:51:18.464
<i>No, I'm probably in
some frog hospital,</i>


765
00:51:18.464 --> 00:51:20.550
<i>or maybe limey.</i>

766
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.157
<i>At least my teeth
don't ache.</i>


767
00:51:24.157 --> 00:51:26.719
<i>Wait a minute.
What's this?</i>


768
00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:28.283
<i>There are two
vibrations,</i>


769
00:51:28.283 --> 00:51:29.805
<i>and one of them
is heavy.</i>


770
00:51:29.805 --> 00:51:31.368
<i>It's a man.</i>

771
00:51:31.411 --> 00:51:34.409
Why are the shutters
closed?


772
00:51:34.409 --> 00:51:35.495
They always have been.

773
00:51:36.017 --> 00:51:38.016
At least, as long
as I've been here.


774
00:51:38.016 --> 00:51:40.101
It's on the order sheet.

775
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:41.621
Well, it's crazy.

776
00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:44.228
<i>Well,
what are you doing?</i>


777
00:51:44.228 --> 00:51:46.314
<i>Hello? Have I
got visitors?</i>


778
00:51:46.314 --> 00:51:47.878
<i>What happened then?</i>

779
00:51:47.878 --> 00:51:49.442
As long as I'm
head nurse of this ward,


780
00:51:49.442 --> 00:51:52.396
the shutters are open
and they will stay open.


781
00:51:52.396 --> 00:51:54.308
Let him have
a little sunshine.


782
00:51:54.308 --> 00:51:55.785
They said it was
to keep people


783
00:51:55.785 --> 00:51:56.785
from peeking
in at him.


784
00:51:58.391 --> 00:51:59.956
It would take a man

785
00:51:59.956 --> 00:52:02.040
to peek through that window.

786
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.605
Oh, and another thing.

787
00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:05.170
I want sheets
on this bed.


788
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.994
<i>He's walking.
No more blankets.</i>


789
00:52:07.994 --> 00:52:10.036
He can't really
tell the difference, you know.


790
00:52:10.036 --> 00:52:12.034
<i>Now he's stopped.
I can.</i>


791
00:52:16.118 --> 00:52:18.594
Well.

792
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:22.635
How did the triage officer
ever overlook this one?


793
00:52:26.805 --> 00:52:28.239
<i>He's looking at me.</i>

794
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.195
Poor baby.

795
00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:37.362
<i>No, it's a woman.</i>

796
00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:38.841
<i>Those hands, a fat woman.</i>

797
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:40.839
<i>That's why I could feel
her footsteps so plain.</i>


798
00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:43.837
Poor-
- Poor baby.

799
00:52:48.224 --> 00:52:49.311
Come on.

800
00:52:58.783 --> 00:53:00.302
<i>That was funny.</i>

801
00:53:00.824 --> 00:53:02.301
<i>What were they doing?
What has happened?</i>


802
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:03.866
<i>What's different?</i>

803
00:53:04.343 --> 00:53:05.864
<i>Think, Joe.</i>

804
00:53:05.864 --> 00:53:06.907
<i>Think. Use your head.</i>

805
00:53:06.907 --> 00:53:08.949
<i>Feel.
Feel with your scalp</i>


806
00:53:08.949 --> 00:53:10.469
<i>and the skin
on your forehead.</i>


807
00:53:10.469 --> 00:53:11.946
<i>Something has changed.</i>

808
00:53:11.946 --> 00:53:15.030
<i>It was cooler before
she came in than it is now.</i>


809
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.595
<i>What I feel is--
is warmth.</i>


810
00:53:17.985 --> 00:53:19.376
<i>But where does it come from?</i>

811
00:53:19.376 --> 00:53:22.417
<i>Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Of course.</i>


812
00:53:22.417 --> 00:53:24.503
<i>Oh, my God. 
I see it now.</i>

813
00:53:24.503 --> 00:53:27.066
It-
- It's the sun.

814
00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:29.151
<i>The sun, the sun, the sun.</i>

815
00:53:29.151 --> 00:53:32.495
<i>I found the sun.</i>

816
00:53:32.495 --> 00:53:35.451
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

817
00:53:35.972 --> 00:53:40.186
Thank you. Thank you.

818
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.529
If I never have
anything else,


819
00:53:47.529 --> 00:53:50.656
I'll always have God

820
00:53:50.656 --> 00:53:53.263
and the morning sunlight.

821
00:54:01.257 --> 00:54:02.692
<i>It's night.</i>

822
00:54:02.692 --> 00:54:04.081
<i>If a man can
tell the difference</i>


823
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:04.950
<i>between day and night,</i>

824
00:54:05.472 --> 00:54:06.428
<i>he's beginning to tell time.</i>

825
00:54:06.428 --> 00:54:08.426
<i>It's warm again.
It's morning,</i>


826
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.425
<i>and she's changing
my sheets.</i>


827
00:54:10.728 --> 00:54:12.293
<i>Now it's night.</i>

828
00:54:12.293 --> 00:54:14.594
<i>Morning again.
She's bathing me.</i>


829
00:54:14.594 --> 00:54:16.116
<i>One morning she changes me,</i>

830
00:54:16.116 --> 00:54:18.028
<i>the next morning,
she bathes me.</i>


831
00:54:18.028 --> 00:54:19.505
<i>Night, night.</i>

832
00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:21.156
<i>Day. Night.</i>

833
00:54:21.503 --> 00:54:22.850
<i>How will I keep track?</i>

834
00:54:23.155 --> 00:54:24.805
<i>I know.
Put a big blackboard up in your mind.</i>


835
00:54:24.805 --> 00:54:26.500
<i>And right here
in the middle,</i>


836
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.151
<i>put a mark for each day.</i>

837
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:30.670
<i>Four, six, seven days.</i>

838
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:32.496
<i>Now, put a mark up
in this corner for the weeks.</i>


839
00:54:32.496 --> 00:54:34.625
<i>Erase the days.
Start over again.</i>


840
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:36.622
<i>Three, four weeks.
That's right!</i>


841
00:54:36.622 --> 00:54:38.057
<i>Erase the weeks
and mark down</i>


842
00:54:38.057 --> 00:54:39.056
<i>a month over here.</i>

843
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:42.575
<i>5, 9, 11, 12 months.</i>

844
00:54:42.575 --> 00:54:43.531
<i>Now that isn't a year,
not yet.</i>


845
00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:45.182
<i>Four twelves is only 48.</i>

846
00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:47.614
<i>Okay, check off
four more weeks,</i>


847
00:54:47.963 --> 00:54:49.179
<i>very carefully.</i>

848
00:54:49.395 --> 00:54:52.262
<i>And then put Roman
numeral number 1</i>


849
00:54:52.262 --> 00:54:54.827
<i>right down here. One year!</i>

850
00:54:54.827 --> 00:54:56.391
<i>I'm ringing bells!</i>

851
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:57.868
<i>Hey, I'm blowing horns</i>

852
00:54:57.868 --> 00:54:59.258
<i>and shooting off
firecrackers.</i>


853
00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:00.779
<i>Everybody's singing</i>

854
00:55:00.779 --> 00:55:03.430
<i>"Should old acquaintance
be forgot."</i>


855
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.514
<i>And I'm saying--</i>

856
00:55:05.514 --> 00:55:08.643
<i>I'm saying,
"Happy New Year, Kareen."</i>


857
00:55:08.643 --> 00:55:10.729
<i>And I'm kissing her.</i>

858
00:55:16.724 --> 00:55:19.243
<i>But it isn't
New Year's Day out there.</i>


859
00:55:19.243 --> 00:55:20.807
<i>Sure, I've counted a year,</i>

860
00:55:20.807 --> 00:55:22.806
<i>but a year from when?</i>

861
00:55:22.806 --> 00:55:25.196
<i>I don't even know
how old I am.</i>


862
00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:27.238
<i>All I know is
I'm 20 years old,</i>


863
00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:29.758
<i>plus X years since
I got blown up,</i>


864
00:55:29.758 --> 00:55:32.235
<i>plus the year I just counted.</i>

865
00:55:32.235 --> 00:55:34.753
<i>But when did
those X years begin?</i>


866
00:55:34.753 --> 00:55:37.318
<i>Think, Joe. 
Think back.</i>

867
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:40.792
<i>We were next to
an English regiment.</i>


868
00:55:40.792 --> 00:55:43.399
<i>And we went out
on night patrol and scattered.</i>


869
00:55:43.399 --> 00:55:44.920
<i>And then I hooked up</i>

870
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.484
<i>with that little
limey corporal</i>


871
00:55:46.484 --> 00:55:47.484
<i>and his outfit, and--</i>

872
00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:50.351
<i>Yes, I remember now.</i>

873
00:55:50.655 --> 00:55:52.740
<i>I was writing a letter
to you, Kareen.</i>


874
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:54.261
Corporal Timlon?

875
00:55:54.261 --> 00:55:55.825
Yes, sir?

876
00:55:58.953 --> 00:56:02.083
What is that damnable odor?

877
00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:03.124
Out there, sir.

878
00:56:03.645 --> 00:56:06.295
This fat Hun came
stumbling through the fog.


879
00:56:06.295 --> 00:56:09.945
Some bloke lost his head
and popped him off.


880
00:56:09.945 --> 00:56:11.509
The stink ain't half so bad

881
00:56:11.814 --> 00:56:12.726
when they're close
to the ground, sir,


882
00:56:12.726 --> 00:56:14.856
but he's got himself
hung up on the wire.


883
00:56:14.856 --> 00:56:16.897
Bad for morale.
Extremely bad.


884
00:56:16.897 --> 00:56:20.025
He's a Bavarian, sir.
They always smell worse.


885
00:56:20.546 --> 00:56:22.111
Yes, they do,
don't they?


886
00:56:22.632 --> 00:56:25.759
Not so bad as Hindu is,
though. Or Welshmen.


887
00:56:25.759 --> 00:56:27.845
While it's nice and quiet,
sir, we keep on trying


888
00:56:27.845 --> 00:56:29.931
to shoot him down,
but he hangs on pretty good.


889
00:56:29.931 --> 00:56:32.538
Well, take a detail
out tonight, Corporal.


890
00:56:32.538 --> 00:56:34.101
And bury him.

891
00:56:34.101 --> 00:56:36.708
Well, but it's kind of
busy out there, sir. Even at night.


892
00:56:37.229 --> 00:56:39.315
And don't forget,
Corporal.


893
00:56:39.315 --> 00:56:41.922
Death has a dignity
all its own.


894
00:56:41.922 --> 00:56:46.092
And you will say
a few words of prayer over the remains.


895
00:56:46.614 --> 00:56:48.178
Yes.

896
00:56:50.264 --> 00:56:52.348
Oh, Jesus!

897
00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.825
Just for that,
I'll take volunteers.


898
00:56:54.825 --> 00:56:56.911
You. You. You.

899
00:56:56.911 --> 00:56:59.430
You two.
You in the back there.


900
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.950
And to almighty God,

901
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:05.861
we commend the soul of
our brother departed,


902
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:08.685
and we commit his body
to the ground.


903
00:57:15.374 --> 00:57:19.242
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,


904
00:57:19.242 --> 00:57:21.675
dust to dust.

905
00:57:21.675 --> 00:57:23.413
Who's got the dust?

906
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:27.844
It's kinda wet, but--

907
00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:28.887
I have--

908
00:57:28.887 --> 00:57:33.058
Well, throw the bloody
stuff in. Go on.


909
00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:39.575
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.


910
00:57:39.575 --> 00:57:41.139
God have mercy on his soul!

911
00:57:41.139 --> 00:57:43.529
The bloody bastards
have shot me in the ass!


912
00:57:43.529 --> 00:57:45.396
Take cover, men.

913
00:57:45.396 --> 00:57:48.003
If it's prayers he wants,
he can make up his own.


914
00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:25.410
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

915
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.366
<i>I shouldn't have
been there at all.</i>


916
00:58:27.366 --> 00:58:28.886
<i>Or that poor
Bavarian, either.</i>


917
00:58:31.319 --> 00:58:32.970
<i>For all I know,</i>

918
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.881
<i>we might have been friends.</i>

919
00:58:36.358 --> 00:58:37.837
<i>Instead of him dead,</i>

920
00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:40.269
<i>out there in the mud.</i>

921
00:58:40.269 --> 00:58:43.397
<i>And me, lying here like...</i>

922
00:58:43.397 --> 00:58:46.394
<i>like some freak
in a carnival show.</i>


923
00:58:49.175 --> 00:58:51.217
<i>Remember that time
in Los Angeles,</i>


924
00:58:51.217 --> 00:58:52.782
<i>when we all went
to the circus,</i>


925
00:58:52.782 --> 00:58:54.824
<i>and took Kareen
with us, too?</i>


926
00:58:54.824 --> 00:58:56.648
<i>And when we got
home, the old man began</i>

927
00:58:56.648 --> 00:58:58.951
<i>imitating those
sideshow barkers?</i>


928
00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:01.383
<i>And the rest of us
joined in, too?</i>


929
00:59:02.904 --> 00:59:04.903
<i>He was a funny man!</i>

930
00:59:04.903 --> 00:59:07.987
<i>Just think what he
could have done with me,</i>


931
00:59:07.987 --> 00:59:09.465
<i>the way I am now.</i>

932
00:59:09.465 --> 00:59:12.810
<i>I eat...through a tube!</i>

933
00:59:13.159 --> 00:59:16.372
He breathes through a tube.

934
00:59:16.372 --> 00:59:18.980
And whatever goes in a tube

935
00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.065
has to come out
through a tube.


936
00:59:21.587 --> 00:59:25.235
He is the armless,
legless wonder


937
00:59:25.235 --> 00:59:27.321
of the 20th century!

938
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:28.885
And yet, by God,

939
00:59:28.885 --> 00:59:30.971
he's just as alive
as you and me!


940
00:59:30.971 --> 00:59:35.141
He was a good boy.

941
00:59:35.402 --> 00:59:39.313
He was always forgetting things!

942
00:59:39.313 --> 00:59:41.485
And it's this
fellow right here!


943
00:59:41.485 --> 00:59:45.091
But he don't worry
about no shoes.


944
00:59:45.091 --> 00:59:46.481
'Cause he don't
need no shoes!


945
00:59:46.742 --> 00:59:48.914
He'd forget his overshoes.

946
00:59:48.914 --> 00:59:51.521
No shoes! No shirt!

947
00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:53.084
No socks!

948
00:59:53.084 --> 00:59:55.169
No gloves! No hat!

949
00:59:55.169 --> 00:59:57.255
He would forget his cap.

950
00:59:57.604 --> 00:59:59.255
No necktie!
No collar buttons!


951
00:59:59.255 --> 01:00:00.297
No vest! No coat!
No nothing!


952
01:00:00.818 --> 01:00:02.903
And now...

953
01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:07.075
he's forgotten...
just everything.


954
01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:10.203
All you gotta do
is drop a love offering


955
01:00:10.203 --> 01:00:13.939
of 15 cents or more
in this little lady's thunder mug.


956
01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.242
And I'll you
what I'm gonna do!


957
01:00:16.242 --> 01:00:19.067
I'm gonna lift the lid
of this box here,


958
01:00:19.067 --> 01:00:21.673
and I'm gonna let you
look at the face


959
01:00:21.673 --> 01:00:23.801
of the only man in the world

960
01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:27.452
who don't give a damn
about anything.


961
01:00:27.452 --> 01:00:29.537
And remember!

962
01:00:29.537 --> 01:00:32.143
It only cost ya 15 cents.

963
01:00:32.143 --> 01:00:34.229
And if this guy
looks back at you,


964
01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:35.793
by golly, I'll give ya
a five dollar bill.


965
01:00:37.704 --> 01:00:39.876
All right! Bring on
the music, Rollo Boy!


966
01:00:39.876 --> 01:00:41.440
Okay! Step right up!

967
01:00:41.962 --> 01:00:43.526
Step right up, folks!

968
01:00:43.526 --> 01:00:45.611
Step right up. Hurry,
hurry, hurry. hurry.


969
01:00:45.611 --> 01:00:47.219
Get a close look
at the man who can't--


970
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.389
Thank you.
Or maybe he can!


971
01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:55.040
Thank you.

972
01:00:56.602 --> 01:00:58.167
Thank you.

973
01:01:00.253 --> 01:01:02.860
See that little lady?
Make her pot ring out


974
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.945
like the bells of St. Mary!

975
01:01:05.466 --> 01:01:08.073
Glory, glory, glory!
Thank you, sir.


976
01:01:08.073 --> 01:01:10.159
Thank you.

977
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.244
Thank you.

978
01:01:12.287 --> 01:01:13.852
Thank you!

979
01:01:16.979 --> 01:01:19.586
Thank you.

980
01:01:19.586 --> 01:01:22.062
Thank you.

981
01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.579
<i>Thank you.</i>

982
01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:46.957
<i>What's this?</i>

983
01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:49.477
<i>A different nurse?</i>

984
01:01:49.477 --> 01:01:51.563
<i>Why does she walk
without vibrations?</i>


985
01:01:51.563 --> 01:01:53.648
<i>Is she tip-toeing?</i>

986
01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.255
<i>Or-
- Or is she just--</i>

987
01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:57.297
<i>little?</i>

988
01:03:00.381 --> 01:03:02.206
<i>Something fell on me.</i>

989
01:03:02.206 --> 01:03:03.683
<i>Something wet.
What was it?</i>


990
01:03:07.289 --> 01:03:08.853
<i>She must be new.</i>

991
01:03:08.853 --> 01:03:12.199
<i>She is new. Her hands
are soft, like Kareen's.</i>


992
01:03:12.677 --> 01:03:15.500
<i>She's a girl,
and I don't make her sick.</i>


993
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.586
<i>She isn't afraid of me.</i>

994
01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.020
<i>Hello, new nurse.</i>

995
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.541
<i>Hello, new beautiful
young nurse.</i>


996
01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:23.148
<i>Hello out there.</i>

997
01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:27.187
<i>Kareen.</i>

998
01:03:27.187 --> 01:03:30.229
<i>Oh, Kareen...</i>

999
01:03:30.229 --> 01:03:33.356
<i>where are you?</i>

1000
01:03:33.356 --> 01:03:36.485
<i>We only made love
to each other one time</i>


1001
01:03:36.485 --> 01:03:40.135
<i>in our--
in our whole lives.</i>


1002
01:03:40.179 --> 01:03:43.827
<i>Joe-oe...</i>

1003
01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:52.560
Joe-oe...

1004
01:03:56.557 --> 01:04:00.642
Come out to the garden
in the pale moonlight!


1005
01:04:03.074 --> 01:04:04.638
Is that you, Kareen?

1006
01:04:04.638 --> 01:04:06.681
Hello, Joe.

1007
01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:08.245
I had to get married.

1008
01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.591
So now I'm somebody
else's Kareen.


1009
01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:12.198
Then where's mine?

1010
01:04:12.198 --> 01:04:13.632
In the pale moonlight,

1011
01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:14.631
where she said she'd be.

1012
01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:54.863
Kareen?

1013
01:05:02.422 --> 01:05:05.376
Why did you bring me
to a place like this?


1014
01:05:05.376 --> 01:05:06.897
I didn't.

1015
01:05:06.897 --> 01:05:08.461
I heard you calling.

1016
01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:11.632
I called,
and I called.


1017
01:05:11.632 --> 01:05:14.239
And you never came.

1018
01:05:14.239 --> 01:05:15.282
I was held up.

1019
01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:18.931
How late am I?

1020
01:05:18.931 --> 01:05:21.016
How long have I been away?

1021
01:05:21.538 --> 01:05:23.102
I don't know.

1022
01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:26.229
It may have been
forever, though.


1023
01:05:26.229 --> 01:05:27.794
I can't remember.

1024
01:05:27.794 --> 01:05:29.315
Well, try, Kareen.

1025
01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:31.922
Please try.

1026
01:05:31.922 --> 01:05:36.135
You see, I don't know
how long I've been here.


1027
01:05:36.135 --> 01:05:37.178
I don't know
what year I'm in.


1028
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.090
And I'm trying
to get back into--


1029
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.088
into time.

1030
01:05:42.088 --> 01:05:45.608
I don't pay much attention
to time any more.


1031
01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.650
Oh, you must.

1032
01:05:48.127 --> 01:05:49.517
All I think about is time.

1033
01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:52.819
Time is what
makes people old.


1034
01:05:52.819 --> 01:05:55.210
The way I am, Kareen,

1035
01:05:55.731 --> 01:05:58.598
the way it is with me,
you'll never grow old.


1036
01:05:58.598 --> 01:06:02.160
Because I keep you
right here in my mind.


1037
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.637
And in my heart.

1038
01:06:03.637 --> 01:06:06.288
Just the way you were
when I saw you last.


1039
01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:10.850
So you see, with me,
you can't get old.


1040
01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:14.022
Your hair will always
stay brown.


1041
01:06:14.022 --> 01:06:17.800
Your skin will always
be fresh like rain.


1042
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.145
I won't let one little
wrinkle mark your face.


1043
01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:26.708
I'll keep you beside me,
young and beautiful forever.


1044
01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:29.662
Because of all the people
in the world,


1045
01:06:30.183 --> 01:06:34.528
only with me will you
be safe from time.


1046
01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:37.482
Like a fresh, fresh flower.

1047
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.002
Like a rose--
I'm not! I'm not!


1048
01:06:41.002 --> 01:06:42.913
Nobody loves me anymore!

1049
01:06:42.913 --> 01:06:44.999
Oh, I do, Kareen.

1050
01:07:01.074 --> 01:07:02.072
Stop that.
What happened to you?


1051
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.723
Don't even know
how to treat her.


1052
01:07:04.723 --> 01:07:06.199
Then you got her pregnant,
went away,


1053
01:07:06.199 --> 01:07:08.285
and stopped writing to her.

1054
01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:11.326
I didn't know! 
I couldn't write!

1055
01:07:11.326 --> 01:07:13.326
Bye, Joe.

1056
01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:16.801
Goodbye.

1057
01:07:26.185 --> 01:07:28.705
Goodbye, Joe!

1058
01:07:28.705 --> 01:07:32.876
Kareen!
Goodbye, Joe...


1059
01:07:40.175 --> 01:07:43.737
[Kareen
Don't let them take you, Joe...


1060
01:07:43.737 --> 01:07:45.301
Run away!

1061
01:07:46.822 --> 01:07:49.342
Goodbye, Joe...

1062
01:07:49.864 --> 01:07:52.470
Can't you tell me
how long it's been?


1063
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:54.512
No...

1064
01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:00.247
Can't you tell me
where I am?


1065
01:08:00.247 --> 01:08:01.724
No...

1066
01:08:08.371 --> 01:08:12.281
Can't you even tell me
what country I'm in?


1067
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:15.845
No country...

1068
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.664
<i>Well...</i>

1069
01:08:25.664 --> 01:08:28.792
<i>I can feel them wheeling
my old bed out.</i>


1070
01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:31.399
<i>And I am in a new one.</i>

1071
01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.484
<i>With a pillow.</i>

1072
01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.047
<i>What next?</i>

1073
01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:47.863
<i>She's moving me.</i>

1074
01:08:47.863 --> 01:08:50.470
<i>Yes.</i>

1075
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.556
<i>Ah, into the sunlight.</i>

1076
01:09:05.589 --> 01:09:07.675
<i>Now she's in back of me.</i>

1077
01:09:20.883 --> 01:09:23.012
<i>That tube.</i>

1078
01:09:23.012 --> 01:09:25.619
<i>I never did
understand that one.</i>


1079
01:09:28.182 --> 01:09:29.225
<i>Now my table.</i>

1080
01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:37.914
<i>What else?</i>

1081
01:10:20.579 --> 01:10:21.621
<i>Good.</i>

1082
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.660
<i>Good.</i>

1083
01:10:33.873 --> 01:10:37.001
<i>I wonder if she's
an American.</i>


1084
01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:39.000
<i>I hope so.</i>

1085
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.433
<i>I've only seen
one American girl</i>


1086
01:10:41.433 --> 01:10:42.301
<i>since I left home.</i>

1087
01:10:42.779 --> 01:10:46.255
I'm as American as apple pie.

1088
01:10:49.253 --> 01:10:51.816
I was born
in San Francisco.


1089
01:10:51.816 --> 01:10:53.641
Didn't I tell you?

1090
01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:55.726
I was there when
the earthquake hit


1091
01:10:55.726 --> 01:10:57.768
in 1906.

1092
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.375
Believe me,
that was a shake.


1093
01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:03.981
I was up on the fourth floor

1094
01:11:03.981 --> 01:11:05.415
of a hotel on Market Street,

1095
01:11:05.415 --> 01:11:08.499
entertaining
a gentleman friend.


1096
01:11:08.499 --> 01:11:11.020
And when I first
heard that thing hit,


1097
01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.582
I said to myself,
I said, "Lucky," I said.


1098
01:11:14.582 --> 01:11:17.232
"That's an earthquake.

1099
01:11:17.232 --> 01:11:18.796
"And you ain't
gonna be caught dead


1100
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:22.663
with no fat son of a bitch
on top of ya like this."


1101
01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:25.400
So you know what I did?

1102
01:11:25.834 --> 01:11:26.878
Uh-uh.

1103
01:11:27.311 --> 01:11:28.267
I pushed him off

1104
01:11:28.267 --> 01:11:30.917
and ran stark naked
down the street.


1105
01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:33.393
And you shoulda seen
the guys stare.


1106
01:11:33.393 --> 01:11:35.479
I'll bet.

1107
01:11:35.479 --> 01:11:36.435
Yeah.

1108
01:11:43.126 --> 01:11:44.604
You aren't wanting
to do anything now,


1109
01:11:44.604 --> 01:11:45.645
I guess, huh?

1110
01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.210
Ah, too tired.

1111
01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.295
That's what that French
cognac will do to ya.


1112
01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.816
It'll be $2.00, just the same.

1113
01:11:54.336 --> 01:11:55.899
Okay.

1114
01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:57.464
What are you
knitting there?


1115
01:11:57.464 --> 01:11:59.940
Sweater for my kid.

1116
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.937
He's only 5 years old.

1117
01:12:03.937 --> 01:12:05.414
And the sweetest little
bastard you ever saw.


1118
01:12:05.414 --> 01:12:07.456
Huh. Where is he?

1119
01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.888
Oh, I keep him in
a school in Long Island.


1120
01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.277
That's in New York.

1121
01:12:13.277 --> 01:12:15.363
A private school.

1122
01:12:15.363 --> 01:12:18.709
They got lots of
polo players there.


1123
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:22.097
And that's what I want him
to be when he grows up.


1124
01:12:22.097 --> 01:12:24.139
Once you're a polo player,

1125
01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:26.181
you meet all
the best people.


1126
01:12:26.181 --> 01:12:27.746
Did you know that?

1127
01:12:32.698 --> 01:12:34.175
You asleep?
No.


1128
01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:40.215
Must have... cost you
a lot of money.


1129
01:12:40.215 --> 01:12:41.691
A school like that.

1130
01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.646
Oh, sure it does!

1131
01:12:43.646 --> 01:12:46.253
But I don't do
too bad here.


1132
01:12:46.253 --> 01:12:49.164
I make about
a hundred bucks a week.


1133
01:12:51.206 --> 01:12:52.814
Of course...

1134
01:12:52.814 --> 01:12:54.812
you got to dress up
to your position,


1135
01:12:54.812 --> 01:12:56.768
and that takes money.

1136
01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:47.295
<i>Kareen?</i>

1137
01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:51.422
<i>Kareen...</i>

1138
01:13:51.422 --> 01:13:53.507
<i>Oh, Kareen.</i>

1139
01:15:58.242 --> 01:15:59.285
Hello, Bill.

1140
01:15:59.285 --> 01:16:00.327
Hi, Mr. Bonham.

1141
01:16:00.327 --> 01:16:01.414
Bill hasn't got a pole,

1142
01:16:01.414 --> 01:16:03.412
and he's only here
for the afternoon.


1143
01:16:03.412 --> 01:16:05.498
And I thought maybe
he could borrow yours.


1144
01:16:05.498 --> 01:16:06.974
We could borrow yours.

1145
01:16:06.974 --> 01:16:08.408
Oh.

1146
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.406
Uh...sure.

1147
01:16:12.406 --> 01:16:13.970
Hey, but, uh--

1148
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:16.098
give Bill your pole,
and you take mine.


1149
01:16:16.098 --> 01:16:17.620
Oh, sure.

1150
01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:23.571
We'll be back
before dark.


1151
01:16:23.571 --> 01:16:25.570
Thank you, Mr. Bonham.
Yeah.


1152
01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:34.389
Hmm.

1153
01:18:10.492 --> 01:18:12.013
Father.

1154
01:18:15.401 --> 01:18:16.445
Yes?

1155
01:18:19.964 --> 01:18:24.526
I lost your pole
today, Father.


1156
01:18:24.526 --> 01:18:25.915
Got a quick strike,
and before we knew,


1157
01:18:26.436 --> 01:18:29.262
your pole
was in the water.


1158
01:18:29.262 --> 01:18:31.695
And, um-- we hunted
around for it,


1159
01:18:31.695 --> 01:18:34.301
fished with the oars,
but--


1160
01:18:34.692 --> 01:18:37.299
but we couldn't find it,
so it's gone.


1161
01:19:01.628 --> 01:19:03.627
Well...

1162
01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:09.144
Shouldn't let
a fishing pole...


1163
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:13.619
spoil our last trip
together, should we?


1164
01:19:13.619 --> 01:19:14.619
No.

1165
01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:56.024
I'll go on ahead. 
Catch us a ride into town.

1166
01:19:58.108 --> 01:19:59.673
I won't be long.

1167
01:20:14.271 --> 01:20:16.660
<i>Hello?</i>

1168
01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.224
<i>Is it you?</i>

1169
01:20:19.224 --> 01:20:20.787
<i>The one I love?</i>

1170
01:20:23.916 --> 01:20:25.393
<i>Yes.</i>

1171
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:38.427
<i>What's this?</i>

1172
01:20:38.427 --> 01:20:39.426
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1173
01:20:43.857 --> 01:20:45.942
<i>One up. One down.</i>

1174
01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:48.550
<i>One up. One down again.</i>

1175
01:20:50.114 --> 01:20:51.678
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

1176
01:20:51.678 --> 01:20:54.197
<i>It can't be!
It can't!</i>


1177
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.847
<i>Are you talking to me
out there?</i>


1178
01:20:56.847 --> 01:20:58.846
<i>Are you saying
something to me?</i>


1179
01:20:59.367 --> 01:21:02.931
<i>Are you drawing a letter
on my skin, and then erasing it?</i>


1180
01:21:02.931 --> 01:21:03.973
<i>A word?</i>

1181
01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.621
<i>You are. You are.
You are! Yes, you are!</i>


1182
01:21:09.621 --> 01:21:11.663
<i>It's a letter M!</i>

1183
01:21:11.663 --> 01:21:14.226
<i>Yes. Oh, God bless you,
nurse! I got it! M!</i>


1184
01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:21.656
<i>E.</i>

1185
01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:26.652
<i>R.</i>

1186
01:21:30.128 --> 01:21:32.213
<i>R.</i>

1187
01:21:36.775 --> 01:21:38.339
<i>Y. Yes.</i>

1188
01:21:38.339 --> 01:21:40.425
<i>Yes, of course
I've got it!</i>


1189
01:21:40.425 --> 01:21:42.335
<i>Merry!</i>

1190
01:21:42.509 --> 01:21:44.986
I'm trying to tell you.

1191
01:21:44.986 --> 01:21:46.507
Merry Christmas.

1192
01:21:47.072 --> 01:21:48.592
C.

1193
01:21:53.198 --> 01:21:54.717
H.

1194
01:21:59.845 --> 01:22:01.279
R.

1195
01:22:03.148 --> 01:22:05.058
I.

1196
01:22:08.534 --> 01:22:10.011
S.

1197
01:22:12.618 --> 01:22:13.662
T.

1198
01:22:30.039 --> 01:22:33.690
<i>Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!</i>


1199
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:36.687
<i>Oh, Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!</i>


1200
01:22:36.687 --> 01:22:37.729
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1201
01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:41.727
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1202
01:22:43.812 --> 01:22:46.420
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1203
01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.983
<i>I've got a date
to count from!</i>


1204
01:22:48.983 --> 01:22:51.546
<i>By counting Christmases,
I can tell when it's spring!</i>


1205
01:22:51.546 --> 01:22:53.631
<i>I can tell when it's summer!</i>

1206
01:22:53.631 --> 01:22:56.107
<i>I can smell leaves
burning in autumn.</i>


1207
01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:01.017
<i>Oh, Merry Christmas,
sweet nurse.</i>


1208
01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:04.102
<i>Merry Christmas to you.</i>

1209
01:23:04.102 --> 01:23:05.666
<i>Merry Christmas,
and all my love!</i>


1210
01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:08.272
<i>Merry, Merry,
Merry Christmas.</i>


1211
01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:10.663
Merry Christmas!

1212
01:23:29.735 --> 01:23:32.342
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.


1213
01:23:32.342 --> 01:23:34.426
Merry Christmas.

1214
01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:37.033
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.


1215
01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:38.077
Merry Christmas.

1216
01:23:38.077 --> 01:23:40.120
I'm the boss.

1217
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.204
This is champagne.

1218
01:23:42.204 --> 01:23:43.638
Merry Christmas.

1219
01:23:43.638 --> 01:23:45.680
Where's my boy?
I'm the boss.


1220
01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.766
Where's my little boy?
This is champagne.


1221
01:23:47.766 --> 01:23:49.329
Merry Christmas.
He's too young.


1222
01:23:49.329 --> 01:23:51.415
Can't you see--
I'm the boss.


1223
01:23:51.415 --> 01:23:53.500
...he's underage?
This is champagne.


1224
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.107
Merry Christmas!
He just came up from Tucson.


1225
01:23:56.107 --> 01:23:57.149
I'm the boss.

1226
01:23:57.670 --> 01:23:59.235
This is champagne.
His name is--


1227
01:23:59.756 --> 01:24:00.799
Merry Christmas.
...Jesus Christ.


1228
01:24:00.799 --> 01:24:02.885
I'm the boss.
And today is


1229
01:24:02.885 --> 01:24:03.928
his birthday.

1230
01:24:03.928 --> 01:24:06.534
Merry Christmas.

1231
01:24:06.534 --> 01:24:07.576
I'm the boss.

1232
01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:09.662
This is champagne.

1233
01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:12.269
Merry Christmas.

1234
01:24:12.269 --> 01:24:13.833
I'm the boss.

1235
01:24:13.833 --> 01:24:15.396
This is champagne.

1236
01:24:15.396 --> 01:24:16.440
Merry Christmas.

1237
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.003
Might I cut in?

1238
01:24:18.003 --> 01:24:19.568
Uh-uh.

1239
01:24:19.568 --> 01:24:21.132
I have influence.

1240
01:24:21.132 --> 01:24:24.260
Merry Christmas.
I can get you a soft berth.


1241
01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:26.345
I can be
of great help.


1242
01:24:26.345 --> 01:24:27.865
Merry Christmas.
I can help myself.


1243
01:24:27.865 --> 01:24:29.430
That's what you think.

1244
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:31.516
But everything
has changed.


1245
01:24:31.516 --> 01:24:34.643
The time has come
for you to go out


1246
01:24:34.643 --> 01:24:36.121
and fight.

1247
01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:38.075
Are you going
to fight, too?


1248
01:24:38.075 --> 01:24:40.161
Merry Christmas.
I'm overaged. I can't.


1249
01:24:40.161 --> 01:24:43.289
But somebody's
got to fight them.


1250
01:24:43.289 --> 01:24:45.940
Merry Christmas.
We must have a just


1251
01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:49.068
and lasting peace!

1252
01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:51.153
Merry Christmas.
We've already got ours.


1253
01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:52.196
Damn right.

1254
01:24:52.196 --> 01:24:54.282
See these?
Two arms.


1255
01:24:54.282 --> 01:24:55.845
Merry Christmas.
You see these?


1256
01:24:55.845 --> 01:24:56.888
Two legs.

1257
01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:58.452
You see this?

1258
01:24:58.452 --> 01:25:00.017
One girl.

1259
01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:02.624
Merry Christmas.
What else does anyone want?


1260
01:25:02.624 --> 01:25:03.666
I'm the boss.

1261
01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.708
This is champagne.
Liberty.


1262
01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:05.751
And justice.

1263
01:25:05.751 --> 01:25:07.837
Merry Christmas.
Liberty.


1264
01:25:07.837 --> 01:25:08.879
And justice.

1265
01:25:09.923 --> 01:25:11.486
Liberty.
I love you, Kareen.


1266
01:25:11.486 --> 01:25:14.614
Merry Christmas.
You're so lucky, Joe. You are.


1267
01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:15.613
You don't understand.

1268
01:25:15.613 --> 01:25:17.699
I have to make
the world safe.


1269
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:19.785
This is champagne.

1270
01:25:19.785 --> 01:25:21.826
Merry Christmas.

1271
01:25:21.826 --> 01:25:22.868
I'm the boss.

1272
01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.954
This is champagne.

1273
01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:27.561
Merry Christmas.

1274
01:25:27.561 --> 01:25:28.604
I'm the boss.
You're not my boy.


1275
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.167
This is champagne.

1276
01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.210
Where's my boy?

1277
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:33.296
Merry Christmas.
Kareen?


1278
01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:35.381
Where's
my little boy?


1279
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:36.424
Kareen?

1280
01:25:36.424 --> 01:25:38.510
I'm the boss.

1281
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:40.073
This is champagne.

1282
01:25:40.073 --> 01:25:43.071
Merry Christmas!

1283
01:25:44.548 --> 01:25:46.547
Fellow workers.

1284
01:25:48.154 --> 01:25:49.067
Ahem!

1285
01:25:49.588 --> 01:25:51.109
Fellow workers?

1286
01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.454
Fellow workers!

1287
01:25:58.104 --> 01:26:00.711
Due to the war emergency,

1288
01:26:00.711 --> 01:26:04.403
our little holiday will end
in just three more minutes.


1289
01:26:04.403 --> 01:26:06.923
But the ovens are hot,

1290
01:26:06.923 --> 01:26:09.183
and we must keep
the home fires burning.


1291
01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:11.572
Let us sing.

1292
01:26:15.222 --> 01:26:21.696
♪ Keep the home fires
burning ♪


1293

1302
01:27:16.133 --> 01:27:17.090
Father.

1303
01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:25.256
Hello, son.

1304
01:27:25.256 --> 01:27:26.256
Hello, Father.

1305
01:27:26.778 --> 01:27:28.342
Want some honey?

1306
01:27:28.342 --> 01:27:29.385
No, thanks.

1307
01:27:29.385 --> 01:27:30.428
Sit down.

1308
01:27:37.639 --> 01:27:39.202
Goodbye, Joe.

1309
01:27:39.202 --> 01:27:41.201
Who was that girl?

1310
01:27:44.155 --> 01:27:45.677
I really don't know.

1311
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:48.761
I was fishing.
She happened by.


1312
01:27:49.283 --> 01:27:51.367
Wriggled
into my arms and stayed there.


1313
01:27:52.846 --> 01:27:54.931
So many young girls
these days


1314
01:27:54.931 --> 01:27:59.057
seem to be
hunting for a place in old men's arms.


1315
01:27:59.057 --> 01:28:00.015
Pshew.

1316
01:28:02.099 --> 01:28:03.664
Where did all
the young men go?


1317
01:28:03.664 --> 01:28:05.140
They drift away.

1318
01:28:06.704 --> 01:28:08.312
How is it with you,
Father?


1319
01:28:08.312 --> 01:28:09.789
It's all right.

1320
01:28:11.309 --> 01:28:13.351
You know,
it's a funny thing.


1321
01:28:16.262 --> 01:28:18.348
I was a very good
shoe clerk.


1322
01:28:18.348 --> 01:28:19.912
But I was
more than that.


1323
01:28:19.912 --> 01:28:21.476
I could handle
a horse.


1324
01:28:21.476 --> 01:28:22.519
If I had a cow,

1325
01:28:22.519 --> 01:28:24.039
she was
always healthy,


1326
01:28:24.039 --> 01:28:25.647
gave plenty of milk.

1327
01:28:25.647 --> 01:28:28.254
Raised our own food
on two city lots.


1328
01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:32.860
Even up to the honey
on our biscuits.


1329
01:28:33.902 --> 01:28:36.509
I could, uh, hoe
a pretty good row...


1330
01:28:37.898 --> 01:28:39.376
lay out
a pretty good grade


1331
01:28:39.376 --> 01:28:41.983
on an uphill road.
Build a house.


1332
01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:47.196
But I never did learn
how to make any money.


1333
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:50.717
The goddamndest thing
I ever ran into.


1334
01:28:52.279 --> 01:28:53.757
See, the trouble
with life is


1335
01:28:53.757 --> 01:28:55.320
you work so much,
you don't enjoy it.


1336
01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.885
Yeah.

1337
01:28:56.885 --> 01:28:57.927
Yeah.

1338
01:29:01.534 --> 01:29:02.619
Better this way.

1339
01:29:04.705 --> 01:29:05.226
Except...

1340
01:29:07.312 --> 01:29:08.353
I do miss your mother.

1341
01:29:13.004 --> 01:29:14.047
How is she?

1342
01:29:14.047 --> 01:29:16.133
I haven't seen her lately.

1343
01:29:16.133 --> 01:29:17.174
Oh.

1344
01:29:18.217 --> 01:29:19.260
Well...

1345
01:29:22.735 --> 01:29:24.734
not too long
till sunrise.


1346
01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.298
Mmhh.

1347
01:29:26.298 --> 01:29:27.819
I have to go.

1348
01:29:29.904 --> 01:29:31.337
Trout'll be rising.

1349
01:29:31.337 --> 01:29:33.248
Willow Lake.

1350
01:29:33.248 --> 01:29:35.204
Now that I got
my pole back, I don't want to miss 'em.


1351
01:29:38.854 --> 01:29:40.375
Goodbye, Father.

1352
01:29:42.982 --> 01:29:45.024
Give my love
to your mother when you see her.


1353
01:29:47.065 --> 01:29:49.020
Sorry I had to leave
you in the lurch,


1354
01:29:49.063 --> 01:29:50.628
but it was
the only way, believe me.


1355
01:29:52.193 --> 01:29:53.060
Goodbye.

1356
01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:26.731
Joe.

1357
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:28.731
Joe.

1358
01:30:28.731 --> 01:30:31.077
Here I am.

1359
01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:33.074
No, Joe.
Over here.


1360
01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:36.724
Let's play
blindman's bluff.


1361
01:30:37.767 --> 01:30:38.810
Joe.

1362
01:30:43.936 --> 01:30:45.936
Find me, Joe.

1363
01:30:45.936 --> 01:30:48.454
Why did you
leave me, Joe?


1364
01:30:49.497 --> 01:30:50.498
Run, Joe.

1365
01:30:50.498 --> 01:30:53.365
Why didn't you
write me?


1366
01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:54.711
I couldn't
write you!


1367
01:30:54.711 --> 01:30:56.275
I just couldn't!

1368
01:30:58.230 --> 01:30:59.230
Why couldn't you?

1369
01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:00.706
I can't tell you!

1370
01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:02.270
That's all!
I can't!


1371
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:05.225
You don't
love me, Joe.


1372
01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:13.828
You don't love me.

1373
01:31:13.828 --> 01:31:15.392
I do love you!

1374
01:31:16.825 --> 01:31:17.910
I do love you!

1375
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:19.953
No, you don't, Joe.
You never did.


1376
01:31:19.953 --> 01:31:22.039
Don't go, Kareen!

1377
01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.079
Where are you?

1378
01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:27.209
Olly olly
oxen free!


1379
01:31:28.599 --> 01:31:30.163
Don't go away
from me again.


1380
01:31:36.767 --> 01:31:38.287
Please.

1381
01:31:39.287 --> 01:31:40.329
Don't.

1382
01:31:45.977 --> 01:31:47.020
You need help, son.

1383
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:53.797
There isn't any help.

1384
01:31:53.797 --> 01:31:56.970
Have you asked for any?

1385
01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:58.534
I can't.

1386
01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.269
I can't ask for anything.

1387
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:08.440
There is no way
I can talk to them.


1388
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.089
Then why don't you
send a telegram?


1389
01:32:23.906 --> 01:32:26.556
A telegram?

1390
01:32:26.556 --> 01:32:29.119
Don't you remember
when you were little?


1391
01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:31.205
How you and Bill Harper
used to


1392
01:32:31.205 --> 01:32:33.291
string a wire
between the two houses


1393
01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:35.767
so you could telegraph
to each other?


1394
01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:39.242
Yes.

1395
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:47.715
Still remember
the Morse code?


1396
01:32:49.235 --> 01:32:50.800
Yes.

1397
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:57.011
What good is that?

1398
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:59.575
How can I type out
a message to them?


1399
01:32:59.575 --> 01:33:02.139
You've got to learn to think.

1400
01:33:02.139 --> 01:33:04.224
Use your head.

1401
01:33:06.266 --> 01:33:08.698
Yes.

1402
01:33:08.698 --> 01:33:11.784
Yes. My head.

1403
01:33:13.782 --> 01:33:16.216
My head. My head, my head!

1404
01:33:16.737 --> 01:33:18.474
Yes.

1405
01:33:19.865 --> 01:33:23.515
<i>Yes. My head.</i>

1406
01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:25.600
<i>My head.</i>

1407
01:33:49.886 --> 01:33:51.972
<i>Where is she going?</i>

1408
01:33:53.796 --> 01:33:56.968
Captain?
Yes?


1409
01:33:56.968 --> 01:33:59.053
Could you come here
a minute, please?


1410
01:33:59.053 --> 01:34:02.659
Yes, of course. Would you
take care of that, nurse? Thank you.


1411
01:34:02.659 --> 01:34:04.745
<i>She's brought somebody in!</i>

1412
01:34:13.043 --> 01:34:15.128
I can't understand
what he's doing.


1413
01:34:16.648 --> 01:34:18.213
May I see
the orders, please?


1414
01:34:18.213 --> 01:34:19.777
Yes.

1415
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:23.947
Thank you.

1416
01:34:23.947 --> 01:34:26.380
Probably an early entry.

1417
01:34:29.944 --> 01:34:31.463
"If bodily action
becomes violent


1418
01:34:31.985 --> 01:34:33.897
or persistently repetitive"--

1419
01:34:33.897 --> 01:34:36.981
These movements
are persistently repetitive.


1420
01:34:36.981 --> 01:34:39.588
"They must be treated
as reflexive muscular spasms."


1421
01:34:39.588 --> 01:34:42.239
Which is to say by sedation.

1422
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.846
Fair enough.
I'll prepare an injection.


1423
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.886
<i>Why is she trying to stop me?</i>

1424
01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:52.579
I don't believe that
the movement is reflexive.


1425
01:34:54.012 --> 01:34:56.055
Oh, you don't?

1426
01:34:56.055 --> 01:34:59.053
Well, General Tillery
will pass through on the 23rd


1427
01:34:59.053 --> 01:35:02.093
with his annual
staff inspection.


1428
01:35:02.093 --> 01:35:03.571
If you don't trust me,
nurse,


1429
01:35:03.571 --> 01:35:05.657
perhaps you'd better
take it up with him.


1430
01:35:09.349 --> 01:35:10.914
I will.

1431
01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:13.521
Well, that's excellent,
nurse.


1432
01:35:13.521 --> 01:35:16.649
General Tillery is
the chief operating surgeon


1433
01:35:16.649 --> 01:35:18.734
who wrote those orders.

1434
01:35:20.254 --> 01:35:21.818
<i>No. No.</i>

1435
01:35:22.339 --> 01:35:24.425
<i>Don't give me dope.</i>

1436
01:35:24.425 --> 01:35:27.553
<i>Don't put me under again.
Would you unlock the door, please?</i>


1437
01:35:27.553 --> 01:35:30.682
<i>I'm trying to talk to you.</i>

1438
01:35:31.203 --> 01:35:34.851
<i>Oh, God, please
make them hear me.</i>


1439
01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:38.372
<i>All I'm asking is for you
to take one little idea</i>


1440
01:35:38.372 --> 01:35:41.934
<i>that's in my mind
and put it into their minds.</i>


1441
01:35:41.934 --> 01:35:45.062
<i>Maybe only 2 or 3
feet away from me.</i>


1442
01:35:45.062 --> 01:35:49.015
<i>It's-- It's such
a little thing to ask,</i>


1443
01:35:49.015 --> 01:35:51.101
<i>but they won't listen.</i>

1444
01:35:51.101 --> 01:35:53.186
<i>They won't hear me.</i>

1445
01:35:53.186 --> 01:35:56.314
<i>All they do is give me dope,</i>

1446
01:35:56.314 --> 01:35:58.749
<i>and I go down</i>

1447
01:35:58.749 --> 01:36:01.355
<i>and down</i>

1448
01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:02.918
<i>and...</i>

1449
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.004
<i>Oh, there you are, brothers.</i>

1450
01:36:06.481 --> 01:36:09.609
<i>What were you hunting
when they caught you?</i>


1451
01:36:09.609 --> 01:36:12.781
<i>Look, Father!
I found your fishing pole!</i>


1452
01:36:14.823 --> 01:36:17.604
<i>Use your head, son.</i>

1453
01:36:17.604 --> 01:36:20.557
<i>I am, Father. I am.</i>

1454
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:24.468
<i>Hear me.</i>

1455
01:36:24.468 --> 01:36:28.986
<i>Please try to understand
what I'm doing and hear me!</i>


1456
01:36:41.541 --> 01:36:43.627
<i>She did hear me!</i>

1457
01:36:43.627 --> 01:36:45.582
<i>She's going
to get somebody!</i>


1458
01:36:48.103 --> 01:36:50.405
<i>She didn't even
close the door!</i>


1459
01:36:58.704 --> 01:37:01.136
<i>I've broken through.</i>

1460
01:37:01.136 --> 01:37:04.308
<i>I'm back
with people again.</i>


1461
01:37:04.308 --> 01:37:07.437
<i>Hello,
all you people out there.</i>


1462
01:37:07.437 --> 01:37:11.563
<i>It's me, and we're going
to talk to each other.</i>


1463
01:37:11.563 --> 01:37:14.170
<i>They're here. 
A lot of them.</i>

1464
01:37:21.253 --> 01:37:22.729
It's Morse code.

1465
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:24.510
For what?

1466
01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:28.290
SOS. Help.

1467
01:37:32.374 --> 01:37:35.328
Do you mean to say
that this man


1468
01:37:35.328 --> 01:37:38.848
is actually speaking to us?

1469
01:37:38.848 --> 01:37:41.281
<i>What are they doing?</i>

1470
01:37:41.281 --> 01:37:42.757
Yes, sir.

1471
01:37:51.838 --> 01:37:53.879
Decerebrated, General?

1472
01:37:54.879 --> 01:37:57.920
Completely decerebrated?

1473
01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.962
<i>What are they waiting for?</i>

1474
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.223
<i>What's happening?</i>

1475
01:38:10.997 --> 01:38:13.604
<i>Are they leaving?</i>

1476
01:38:13.604 --> 01:38:15.168
<i>No.</i>

1477
01:38:15.168 --> 01:38:17.776
<i>Just one of them.</i>

1478
01:38:17.776 --> 01:38:19.774
<i>Or maybe two.</i>

1479
01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:21.381
<i>No. Just one.</i>

1480
01:38:27.507 --> 01:38:29.420
Ask what he wants.

1481
01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.373
How can I ask a man like this
a question like that?


1482
01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:36.457
By asking it.
How else can we help him?


1483
01:38:37.413 --> 01:38:41.019
<i>Why don't they do something?</i>

1484
01:38:43.452 --> 01:38:44.930
<i>They are.
What...</i>


1485
01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.185
do...you...

1486
01:38:54.531 --> 01:38:56.225
want?

1487
01:38:58.137 --> 01:39:01.569
<i>What do I want?</i>

1488
01:39:02.003 --> 01:39:03.654
<i>What do I want?</i>

1489
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:07.218
<i>What I want...</i>

1490
01:39:09.303 --> 01:39:10.867
<i>I want out!</i>

1491
01:39:11.258 --> 01:39:12.648
<i>I want to feel fresh air
against my skin.</i>


1492
01:39:12.952 --> 01:39:15.342
<i>I want to feel people
around me.</i>


1493
01:39:15.646 --> 01:39:17.645
<i>No.</i>

1494
01:39:17.645 --> 01:39:18.688
<i>It would cost too much money</i>

1495
01:39:19.209 --> 01:39:20.685
<i>taking care of me
on the outside.</i>


1496
01:39:20.685 --> 01:39:22.554
<i>They never do that.</i>

1497
01:39:22.554 --> 01:39:25.074
<i>But-- But maybe
there's a way</i>


1498
01:39:25.074 --> 01:39:27.159
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

1499
01:39:28.724 --> 01:39:31.242
<i>Yes! There is a way!</i>

1500
01:39:31.242 --> 01:39:33.328
<i>All you have to do
is put me on display</i>


1501
01:39:33.328 --> 01:39:34.935
<i>and people
will pay to see me.</i>


1502
01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:37.021
<i>Lots of people.
Put me in a fancy coffin</i>


1503
01:39:37.542 --> 01:39:39.497
<i>with windows in it,
and take me out where people</i>


1504
01:39:39.497 --> 01:39:41.453
<i>are spending money
and having fun.</i>


1505
01:39:41.453 --> 01:39:43.539
<i>Take me to the beaches
and the county fairs</i>


1506
01:39:43.539 --> 01:39:44.580
<i>and the 4th of July
celebrations</i>


1507
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.666
<i>and all the church bazaars.</i>

1508
01:39:46.666 --> 01:39:48.708
<i>They've seen
the pin-headed girl from Timbuktu</i>


1509
01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:49.751
<i>or the dog-faced man</i>

1510
01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:51.315
<i>who crawls on his belly
like a reptile.</i>


1511
01:39:51.315 --> 01:39:53.357
<i>But they're not real freaks.
They were born that way.</i>


1512
01:39:53.357 --> 01:39:55.442
<i>They were made
that way by God.</i>


1513
01:39:55.442 --> 01:39:57.528
<i>But this thing here
in his fancy coffin</i>


1514
01:39:57.528 --> 01:39:59.569
<i>was made by people--</i>

1515
01:39:59.569 --> 01:40:01.655
<i>by you and me
and the lady next door--</i>


1516
01:40:01.655 --> 01:40:03.132
<i>and that takes
a lot of planning</i>


1517
01:40:03.132 --> 01:40:04.610
<i>and costs a lot of money.</i>

1518
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:06.694
<i>Advertise me as the only
piece of meat in the world</i>


1519
01:40:07.216 --> 01:40:08.780
<i>that can talk through
the back of its head.</i>


1520
01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.301
<i>And if that
doesn't pull them in, then-- then-- then--</i>


1521
01:40:11.866 --> 01:40:13.951
<i>then bill me as the last man
on earth who joined the Army.</i>


1522
01:40:13.951 --> 01:40:16.036
<i>Because the army makes men.</i>

1523
01:40:16.036 --> 01:40:17.600
<i>So rally around
the flag, boys--</i>


1524
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.686
<i>your flag, their flag,
anybody's flag--</i>


1525
01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:20.641
<i>because the flag
needs soldiers,</i>


1526
01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:23.683
<i>and the army makes men.</i>

1527
01:40:23.683 --> 01:40:28.896
I...want...out...

1528
01:40:29.157 --> 01:40:32.241
so...people...

1529
01:40:32.762 --> 01:40:36.151
can...see...

1530
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:39.019
what...I am.

1531
01:40:39.019 --> 01:40:43.450
Put me...in...

1532
01:40:43.450 --> 01:40:46.839
a...

1533
01:40:46.839 --> 01:40:50.879
c-carnival...show

1534
01:40:50.879 --> 01:40:55.008
where they...can

1535
01:40:55.051 --> 01:40:57.614
look...at me.

1536
01:40:57.614 --> 01:41:00.785
Let...me out.

1537
01:41:00.785 --> 01:41:04.869
Well, what could we
have expected?


1538
01:41:05.912 --> 01:41:08.475
Tell him, uh...

1539
01:41:08.475 --> 01:41:10.473
Tell him we'll do
everything we can,


1540
01:41:10.473 --> 01:41:13.385
but, uh, his condition
won't permit him to be moved.


1541
01:41:13.688 --> 01:41:15.123
For the present, that is.

1542
01:41:15.644 --> 01:41:18.468
Be sure to say
"for the present."


1543
01:41:27.853 --> 01:41:29.286
If...

1544
01:41:30.893 --> 01:41:31.893
you...

1545
01:41:34.326 --> 01:41:38.237
won't...let...

1546
01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:41.495
people see me,

1547
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:43.190
then...

1548
01:41:45.274 --> 01:41:46.622
kill me.

1549
01:42:01.132 --> 01:42:04.129
He's upset.
Understandably so.


1550
01:42:04.650 --> 01:42:06.215
Ask him what his name is.

1551
01:42:26.592 --> 01:42:29.937
These shutters are to be closed
at all times.


1552
01:42:29.937 --> 01:42:32.022
What's he saying?

1553
01:42:32.457 --> 01:42:35.063
He says, "Kill me."

1554
01:42:35.063 --> 01:42:37.497
Over and over again.
"Kill me."


1555
01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:44.839
Tell him we'll do everything
we can to make him comfortable.

1556
01:42:44.839 --> 01:42:46.360
For now, he needs rest.

1557
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.357
Tell him we'll give him
a sedative and come back later.


1558
01:42:49.357 --> 01:42:51.400
And try to get his name.

1559
01:42:53.441 --> 01:42:56.440
You're not to mention
what has happened here to anyone.


1560
01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.481
I'll hold you collectively
responsible for any breach.


1561
01:42:59.481 --> 01:43:02.522
If new orders are received
in view of the new situation which has developed,


1562
01:43:02.522 --> 01:43:04.607
you'll be notified.

1563
01:43:05.129 --> 01:43:06.170
Well?

1564
01:43:08.213 --> 01:43:11.123
He won't wait
for an answer.


1565
01:43:11.123 --> 01:43:14.210
All he says is

1566
01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:18.640
"Kill me, kill me, kill me."

1567
01:43:21.116 --> 01:43:24.201
Don't you have some message
for him, Padre?


1568
01:43:26.722 --> 01:43:27.677
You could at least tell him

1569
01:43:27.677 --> 01:43:29.370
to put his faith in God,
couldn't you?


1570
01:43:30.805 --> 01:43:33.369
I'll pray for him
for the rest of my days,


1571
01:43:33.889 --> 01:43:36.323
but I will not risk
testing his faith


1572
01:43:36.323 --> 01:43:38.191
against your stupidity.

1573
01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.881
Well, you're a hell
of a priest, aren't you?


1574
01:43:45.403 --> 01:43:48.488
He's the product
of your profession,


1575
01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.877
not mine.

1576
01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.092
Clear the room.

1577
01:43:55.092 --> 01:43:57.698
Give him a light sedative,
nurse.


1578
01:43:59.262 --> 01:44:01.869
<i>They're going away. Why?</i>

1579
01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:03.868
<i>Why don't they get it
over with and kill me?</i>


1580
01:44:05.345 --> 01:44:07.735
<i>But you're still here.</i>

1581
01:44:07.735 --> 01:44:10.341
<i>Can't you see
what I'm tapping to you?</i>


1582
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:13.470
<i>I'm asking you to kill me.</i>

1583
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:15.555
<i>Please do.</i>

1584
01:44:39.928 --> 01:44:41.839
O my God,

1585
01:44:42.839 --> 01:44:45.271
I'm heartily sorry

1586
01:44:45.271 --> 01:44:47.748
for having offended thee.

1587
01:44:49.227 --> 01:44:52.266
And I detest all my sins,

1588
01:44:52.266 --> 01:44:54.700
not because of Thy judgment,
O Lord,


1589
01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.524
but because
thou art all good


1590
01:44:57.524 --> 01:45:00.781
and deserving
of all my love.


1591
01:45:08.037 --> 01:45:10.123
I firmly resolve,

1592
01:45:10.123 --> 01:45:13.511
with the help of thy grace,

1593
01:45:13.511 --> 01:45:16.945
to sin no more, to avoid
all the occasions of sin.


1594
01:45:19.942 --> 01:45:21.462
Amen.

1595
01:45:28.848 --> 01:45:30.890
<i>Oh, nurse--</i>

1596
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:35.017
<i>beautiful,
beautiful nurse--</i>


1597
01:45:35.017 --> 01:45:37.017
<i>thank you,</i>

1598
01:45:37.017 --> 01:45:40.492
<i>thank you, thank you.</i>

1599
01:45:40.492 --> 01:45:42.577
<i>Dear God,
thank her for me.</i>


1600
01:45:42.577 --> 01:45:44.663
<i>Be sweet to her, God.</i>

1601
01:45:44.663 --> 01:45:47.183
<i>Make her happy.
Make her beautiful.</i>


1602
01:45:47.183 --> 01:45:49.834
<i>Make everything she wants
come true!</i>


1603
01:45:50.355 --> 01:45:51.919
<i>Make everyone love her!</i>

1604
01:45:54.004 --> 01:45:55.568
No!

1605
01:45:57.132 --> 01:45:58.653
No.

1606
01:45:58.653 --> 01:45:59.695
Leave the room.

1607
01:45:59.695 --> 01:46:04.083
<i>Oh, somebody stopped her.</i>

1608
01:46:04.083 --> 01:46:06.386
<i>Why?</i>

1609
01:46:06.386 --> 01:46:10.167
I said,
"Leave the room."


1610
01:46:10.688 --> 01:46:12.513
Give me the key.

1611
01:46:12.513 --> 01:46:15.076
<i>What's happening?</i>

1612
01:46:15.076 --> 01:46:17.030
The key?

1613
01:46:20.594 --> 01:46:22.157
Go on.

1614
01:46:24.155 --> 01:46:26.719
<i>She's going.</i>

1615
01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:29.499
<i>I can feel her
moving toward the door.</i>


1616
01:46:29.499 --> 01:46:32.496
<i>He's sending her away.</i>

1617
01:46:32.496 --> 01:46:34.496
<i>Why?</i>

1618
01:46:34.496 --> 01:46:36.494
<i>First they
close the shutters,</i>


1619
01:46:36.494 --> 01:46:40.622
<i>and now they're
sending her away.</i>


1620
01:46:40.622 --> 01:46:43.185
<i>Why did they
close the shutters?</i>


1621
01:46:45.531 --> 01:46:48.137
<i>Why is he
sending her away?</i>


1622
01:46:49.701 --> 01:46:52.787
<i>Why won't they
let me talk?</i>


1623
01:46:53.177 --> 01:46:56.827
<i>Because I'm a secret
or something?</i>


1624
01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:58.913
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

1625
01:47:00.432 --> 01:47:02.432
<i>She's gone.</i>

1626
01:47:03.996 --> 01:47:06.082
<i>Good-bye, nurse.</i>

1627
01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:10.295
<i>You're gone,</i>

1628
01:47:10.295 --> 01:47:12.380
<i>and I'm a secret.</i>

1629
01:47:13.945 --> 01:47:16.030
<i>Oh, no. Not that again.</i>

1630
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.807
<i>I-- I thought
they'd be glad</i>


1631
01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:26.848
<i>that I found a way to--</i>

1632
01:47:26.848 --> 01:47:28.934
<i>to talk to them.</i>

1633
01:47:29.976 --> 01:47:32.062
<i>But they're not.</i>

1634
01:47:35.711 --> 01:47:38.839
<i>The only thing on this earth
I'm any good for</i>


1635
01:47:40.361 --> 01:47:43.010
<i>they won't let me do.</i>

1636
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:44.574
<i>All they want is to push me</i>

1637
01:47:44.574 --> 01:47:48.745
<i>back into the darkness
down here</i>


1638
01:47:48.745 --> 01:47:51.742
<i>so they won't ever
see me again.</i>


1639
01:47:53.177 --> 01:47:56.782
<i>He's gone, too.</i>

1640
01:47:56.782 --> 01:48:00.214
<i>Well, now I know.</i>

1641
01:48:00.214 --> 01:48:02.258
<i>They'll never let me out.</i>

1642
01:48:04.255 --> 01:48:07.774
<i>They'll keep me a secret here
until someday,</i>


1643
01:48:07.774 --> 01:48:10.772
<i>when I'm an old, old man,</i>

1644
01:48:10.772 --> 01:48:13.814
<i>I'll sneak away
from them and die.</i>


1645
01:48:16.421 --> 01:48:17.985
<i>It isn't easy, though.</i>

1646
01:48:19.374 --> 01:48:24.371
<i>Inside me,
I'm screaming and yelling</i>


1647
01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:26.848
<i>and howling
like a trapped animal...</i>


1648
01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:31.844
<i>and nobody
pays any attention.</i>


1649
01:48:31.844 --> 01:48:34.884
<i>If I had arms,
I could kill myself.</i>


1650
01:48:36.363 --> 01:48:39.360
<i>If I had legs,
I could run away.</i>


1651
01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.272
<i>If I had a voice,</i>

1652
01:48:41.272 --> 01:48:45.094
<i>I could talk and be some
kind of company for myself.</i>


1653
01:48:45.573 --> 01:48:47.571
<i>I could yell for help.</i>

1654
01:48:48.614 --> 01:48:51.482
<i>But nobody'd help me.</i>

1655
01:48:51.482 --> 01:48:54.479
<i>Not even God,
because there isn't any God.</i>


1656
01:48:54.479 --> 01:48:56.999
<i>Couldn't be
in a place like this.</i>


1657
01:48:58.389 --> 01:49:00.258
<i>And, uh...</i>

1658
01:49:02.213 --> 01:49:04.690
<i>And yet,</i>

1659
01:49:04.690 --> 01:49:08.295
<i>I've just got
to do something</i>


1660
01:49:10.728 --> 01:49:13.813
<i>because I--</i>

1661
01:49:14.768 --> 01:49:17.158
<i>I don't see how I can</i>

1662
01:49:17.158 --> 01:49:19.721
<i>go on like this</i>

1663
01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:22.197
<i>much longer.</i>

1664
01:49:26.325 --> 01:49:29.410
<i>S.O.S.</i>

1665
01:49:30.164 --> 01:49:32.786
<i>Help Me.</i>

1666
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:37.172
<i>S.O.S.</i>

1667
01:49:38.092 --> 01:49:40.549
<i>Help Me.</i>

1668
01:49:41.848 --> 01:49:44.471
<i>S.O.S.</i>

1669
01:49:45.729 --> 01:49:48.019
<i>Help Me.</i>

1670
01:49:49.484 --> 01:49:52.356
<i>S.O.S.</i>

1671
01:49:53.323 --> 01:49:55.780
<i>Help Me.</i>

<i>S.O.S.</i>

1673
01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:03.869

<i>S.O.S.</i>

1675
01:50:09.222 --> 01:50:11.097
<i>Help Me.</i>
