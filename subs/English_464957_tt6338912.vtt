1
00:00:01.253 --> 00:00:03.004
- Macdonald Hall.
- Over the last century,


2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:04.465
- Its students
- have gone on to become


3
00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:05.612
Judges, scientists,

4
00:00:05.613 --> 00:00:06.758
journalists,

5
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.240
and one magician who

6
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.719
we don't like to talk about.

7
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.117
But just because they went on

8
00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:12.513
to change the world

9
00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:13.953
doesn't mean they didn't have

10
00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:15.391
any fun while they were here.

11
00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:21.440
What is this noise?

12
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:23.190
That's Boots.

13
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.339
All-around athlete,

14
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.485
all-around great guy.

15
00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:27.321
- Not much of
- a Death Rooster fan.


16
00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:30.531
Seven-alarm clock sound.

17
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.326
- That's me, Bruno.
- Slacker, rules hacker,


18
00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:34.745
and all-around

19
00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.162
not a morning person.

20
00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:37.873
Bruno, we slept in. Practice

21
00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:39.582
starts in 10 minutes.

22
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:48.761
- The two of us
- don't always agree.


23
00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:51.803
Our schemes don't

24
00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:53.387
always work out.

25
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:55.349
- We are so cut from the team
- if we're late again.


26
00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:56.725
- Relax. I figured out
- how to shave


27
00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.519
- Three minutes
- off our shortcut.


28
00:00:58.522 --> 00:00:59.770
Man, you are so accurate

29
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:01.020
with a frozen kumquat!

30
00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.731
- But we're best friends
- for life. Roomies forever.


31
00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:05.025
Oh, we gotta go.

32
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:06.444
There's no time for...

33
00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:07.861
Waffles?

34
00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:11.781
- And nothing will ever
- change that.


35
00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:20.499
- Looking good,
- Chris!


36
00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:28.674
- Lucky for us,
- I always have a plan.


37
00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:32.760
Nice.

38
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:34.513
Finally, some alone time

39
00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:36.264
with my flags of the world.

40
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.269
OK, what do I start with?

41
00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:44.982
You know, I've never

42
00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:46.064
envied the boys

43
00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.735
- over at the Hall
- before...


44
00:01:47.738 --> 00:01:49.736
Until aerial meditation day.

45
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.238
Om...

46
00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.449
- Cathy and Diane go to
- the school across the street,


47
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.806
the Scrimmage Academy

48
00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:58.160
for Education and Awakening,

49
00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.413
which has produced just as many

50
00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:00.663
judges, scientists,

51
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:02.624
- and journalists
- as Macdonald Hall.


52
00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:04.668
Coming through!

53
00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:07.901
Gotta mow this! Kinda late.

54
00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:09.714
Talk soon, bye!

55
00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:12.550
- And that's Sturgeon,
- our headmaster.


56
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:13.969
Always on the lookout

57
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.386
for trouble,

58
00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:16.889
- which usually means
- me and Boots.


59
00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:18.057
Sturgeon's nickname

60
00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:19.223
is The Fish,

61
00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:20.601
but you don't wanna call him

62
00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:21.976
that to his face.

63
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:22.978
Here you go,

64
00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:23.979
Willy,

65
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.606
the updated you-know-what list.

66
00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:27.231
I have divided them

67
00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:29.547
into bad seeds and bad apples.

68
00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:31.861
Ms. Davis, what do you know

69
00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:34.113
about Malbonia?

70
00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:36.574
Is that a skin condition?

71
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:37.951
Well, technically it's an

72
00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:39.326
unincorporated protectorate

73
00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.287
with a constitutional monarchy,

74
00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:43.311
but the real question is,

75
00:02:43.312 --> 00:02:45.332
why is their flag on our pole?

76
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.627
What?

77
00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:48.838
Oh, good Lord.

78
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.140
One hundred.

79
00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:05.770
Roll call!

80
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.502
Hey, look out for

81
00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.232
that garbage can! Look out!

82
00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:18.032
Okay, O'Neal...

83
00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:19.701
And that's what I call

84
00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:21.368
sleeping in in style.

85
00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.038
- It was so relaxing.
- Why don't


86
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.206
We do it every morning?

87
00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:25.372
Never seen you before. Okay.

88
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.626
- I've been thinking about that.
- I kinda have a plan.


89
00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.023
Of course you do.

90
00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:30.419
If we put in job résumés now,

91
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.547
dude, we'll have jobs at the

92
00:03:31.548 --> 00:03:32.672
Hall by the time we graduate

93
00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:33.841
and then we'll never

94
00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:35.008
have to leave.

95
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.260
- I'm just kinda still figuring
- out if we keep our room.


96
00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:38.971
Okay, helmets on!

97
00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:42.098
Let's get... lacrossing.

98
00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.767
Yeah, practicing will help us

99
00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.434
beat those York turkeys.

100
00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:47.354
- Wouldn't it just be more fun
- to pull a bunch of


101
00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:49.106
- Hilarious
- pranks on them, though?


102
00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.336
Come on, we're

103
00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:51.566
better than that.

104
00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:03.161
Is that brains?

105
00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:04.351
Please tell me

106
00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:05.538
that's not your brain!

107
00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.291
It's pudding! And it's

108
00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:09.043
on your heads! Ha-ha-ha!

109
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:12.317
The best part is when you put

110
00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.921
the pudding in the helmets.

111
00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.051
- Ah yes, Macdonald Hall's
- bitter rivals, York Academy.


112
00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:19.491
This isn't a story about that

113
00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.928
rivalry, but it starts there,

114
00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:22.285
thanks to a really

115
00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:23.639
dumb prank called...

116
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.392
The old "putting pudding

117
00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.143
in a helmet" gag. Classic!

118
00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:29.417
Let's get out of here.

119
00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:31.689
Later, suckers!

120
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.817
Look on the bright side...

121
00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:35.943
Free pudding!

122
00:04:35.944 --> 00:04:38.445
Ha-ha-ha! Mmm!

123
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.305
Good morning, Headmaster

124
00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:43.409
Hartley speaking,

125
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.641
working hard for my students

126
00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:45.870
every day and every way.

127
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.247
Cut the bull, Hartley,

128
00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:48.622
you know it's me.

129
00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.541
Headmaster Sturgeon?

130
00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:51.918
Well, somebody certainly

131
00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.293
got vinegar on their chips

132
00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:54.337
this morning.

133
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.632
Actually, Hartley, I was

134
00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:57.882
getting tired of waiting

135
00:04:57.883 --> 00:04:59.572
for your call.

136
00:04:59.573 --> 00:05:01.260
Call? What call exactly?

137
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:02.325
The one where

138
00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:03.387
your boys apologize

139
00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:04.973
for pulling that infantile prank

140
00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:06.557
on my junior lacrosse team.

141
00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:07.893
Prank? What

142
00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:09.227
do you mean, prank?

143
00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:11.188
- We don't have any pranks
- scheduled here.


144
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.794
Well, I'll just check my agenda,

145
00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:14.398
shall we? Prank...

146
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.734
no... no prank...

147
00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:17.068
no prank...

148
00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.904
no...

149
00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:20.218
No, absolutely no prank

150
00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.530
scheduled whatsoever.

151
00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:22.865
Come off it, Hartley,

152
00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:23.867
are you telling me

153
00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:24.868
you don't know anything

154
00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:26.015
about these pudding helmets?

155
00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:27.161
Oh my!

156
00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:28.747
- That's not where
- pudding belongs.


157
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.290
- That sounds
- downright messy.


158
00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.625
I hope it didn't

159
00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:32.960
set your boys off.

160
00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:36.568
Because pudding needs

161
00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.172
to set, you see.

162
00:05:38.173 --> 00:05:39.195
Yeah, I got it, Hartley,

163
00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:40.216
it just wasn't funny.

164
00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.406
Oh! Well, you know

165
00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.593
what else isn't funny?

166
00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:43.637
I'm getting tired

167
00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:44.678
of waiting around

168
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.013
for you to call me all day!

169
00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:47.307
Call you? What on earth for?

170
00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:48.599
To reassure me

171
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.517
that your students won't stoop

172
00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:51.561
to some lame-o retaliation

173
00:05:51.562 --> 00:05:52.603
against my boys.

174
00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:54.356
You know, let me remind you,

175
00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:56.107
Headmaster Hartley,

176
00:05:56.108 --> 00:05:57.922
that while my boys aren't

177
00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:59.735
perfect, not by a long shot,

178
00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:01.050
they are certainly

179
00:06:01.051 --> 00:06:02.362
well above petty things

180
00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:05.866
like getting revenge. Goodbye.

181
00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.348
We need revenge.

182
00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.828
All of it.

183
00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:10.997
All in favor?

184
00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:12.207
It's unanimous:

185
00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:13.415
revenge will be sought.

186
00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:15.085
- Okay, just promise me
- whatever we do,


187
00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:17.212
- It's better than
- shoving pudding into a helmet.


188
00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.276
Exactly, right? Like,

189
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.339
where's the poetry in that?

190
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.842
Where's the craft?

191
00:06:22.843 --> 00:06:24.342
Alright, so what do we do?

192
00:06:25.387 --> 00:06:26.428
I believe this calls

193
00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:27.931
for a revenge pitch speed round.

194
00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:29.431
Good pitches get a thumbs up,

195
00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:33.186
bad pitches get the gong.

196
00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:34.897
You heard the man.

197
00:06:34.898 --> 00:06:36.605
So what have we got?

198
00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:37.712
We'll play the sound

199
00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:38.816
of an ice cream truck,

200
00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:40.234
and when they come running out,

201
00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:41.924
there's no ice cream.

202
00:06:45.615 --> 00:06:46.888
Okay, I'm not saying

203
00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.159
it's a guillotine, but...

204
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.265
okay, it's pretty much

205
00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:50.369
a guillotine.

206
00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.082
We infect York's water supply

207
00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:56.105
with a special strain

208
00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:57.126
of rhinovirus,

209
00:06:57.127 --> 00:06:58.316
spliced with just enough

210
00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.503
earthworm DNA

211
00:06:59.504 --> 00:07:00.777
to significantly alter their

212
00:07:00.778 --> 00:07:02.048
morphology and create...

213
00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:03.841
Elmer.

214
00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:05.469
Is this another plan to turn

215
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.094
the York boys into worm people?

216
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:09.222
Would that be a problem?

217
00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:17.501
I like

218
00:07:17.502 --> 00:07:18.564
the sentiment, but...

219
00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:19.608
I'm not sure

220
00:07:19.609 --> 00:07:20.649
we can afford a crane.

221
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.113
My uncle raises these

222
00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:26.613
thoroughbred guinea pigs, right?

223
00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:27.636
I say we borrow, like,

224
00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:28.657
a hundred of them...

225
00:07:28.658 --> 00:07:30.285
Nope! Not even

226
00:07:30.286 --> 00:07:31.911
going there.

227
00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:34.080
Severe guinea pig phobia.

228
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:35.915
But they're so cute!

229
00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.542
- And they have
- such luxurious hair...


230
00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:38.648
Can we please talk

231
00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:39.753
about something else?

232
00:07:41.922 --> 00:07:43.194
And so, I say that we hire

233
00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.464
a witch to put a curse

234
00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.466
on the York team.

235
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:49.011
Hm! that's interesting.

236
00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:51.598
Yeah, except for the little

237
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:54.183
detail that curses aren't real.

238
00:07:54.184 --> 00:07:55.707
What if we put a curse

239
00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.228
on the York Academy team,

240
00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:59.356
- but then just don't tell them
- that it's not real?


241
00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:00.691
Wait, athletes are

242
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.024
superstitious...

243
00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:03.172
You mess with their pre-game

244
00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:04.318
traditions and it can throw

245
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.363
- their whole game.
- Exactly, right? If, you know,


246
00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:07.698
Someone steals their mascot,

247
00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.031
something like that.

248
00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.075
Princess Penelope!

249
00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.493
Good shot, boys!

250
00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:16.455
And it's all because of you,

251
00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:18.562
the prettiest princess

252
00:08:18.563 --> 00:08:20.667
in all the land.

253
00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:23.754
Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:25.486
we're gonna steal a princess.

255
00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:30.136
It's about to go down.

256
00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:40.960
Alright, York clothes on.

257
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.731
It's go time. Over.

258
00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:44.046
You know, we are right here.

259
00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:45.359
You could just tell us.

260
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.736
But this way's more fun. Over.

261
00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:50.530
Good point. Over.

262
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.742
Let's do this!

263
00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:02.168
Welcome, parents,

264
00:09:02.169 --> 00:09:05.045
students, pain help,

265
00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:08.215
and our many corporate donors.

266
00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:11.970
Find tomorrow's leaders today!

267
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:16.765
Welcome, one and all,

268
00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:18.914
to another York Boys

269
00:09:18.915 --> 00:09:21.061
Academy pep rally

270
00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:23.647
where we celebrate victory

271
00:09:23.648 --> 00:09:26.400
before it has actually happened.

272
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.069
Why?

273
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.197
Because, come on!

274
00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:35.409
We are the York Boys Academy!

275
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.245
- Dude, I tackled him
- so hard,


276
00:09:37.248 --> 00:09:38.455
It's a miracle

277
00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:39.663
he can still walk.

278
00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:40.832
That's 'cause you're

279
00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:41.999
the greatest, Chip.

280
00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:44.794
Hey, did you hear that?

281
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:48.319
Let's check it out.

282
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.965
Hey, what are you doing?

283
00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:51.239
Check it out,

284
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.510
it's Hartley!

285
00:09:52.511 --> 00:09:53.700
Look at those teeth.

286
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:54.887
Ha-ha-ha!

287
00:09:54.888 --> 00:09:56.847
That's my dad, man.

288
00:09:56.848 --> 00:10:00.059
His nose is way bigger!

289
00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:04.022
Make it bigger, make it bigger.

290
00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:10.652
Oh yeah.

291
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:12.093
Oh, add some spinach

292
00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:13.531
to his teeth. Yeah.

293
00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:22.019
Oh yeah, he's like

294
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.040
a hundred years old, man.

295
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:25.042
Can't forget the wrinkles.

296
00:10:25.043 --> 00:10:26.357
Hey, guys.

297
00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:27.669
Hey, man.

298
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.507
That is just wrong, man.

299
00:10:34.094 --> 00:10:35.220
Copy that. Princess

300
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:36.345
is traveling.

301
00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:39.014
Yo, let's go.

302
00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:40.475
You really captured

303
00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:41.934
his lack of scruples.

304
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:44.728
Nice job,

305
00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:46.356
little weird artist dude.

306
00:10:46.357 --> 00:10:47.981
Oh man, that's just wrong.

307
00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:56.179
Yes!

308
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.241
They had no idea!

309
00:10:57.242 --> 00:10:59.285
Totally clueless.

310
00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:00.850
High fives for a perfectly

311
00:11:00.851 --> 00:11:02.413
planned caper.

312
00:11:02.414 --> 00:11:03.457
Uh-uh. Gotta keep my hands

313
00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:04.498
at ten and two.

314
00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:05.999
Driving's no joke, boys.

315
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.356
High five for Wilbur getting

316
00:11:07.357 --> 00:11:08.710
his license last month

317
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:10.317
and being such

318
00:11:10.318 --> 00:11:11.922
a conscientious driver.

319
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:14.968
- When's the last time
- you ate, Wilbur?


320
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:16.219
Don't look at me.

321
00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:23.143
It came from the cage.

322
00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.730
That does not sound

323
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:28.439
like a princess.

324
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.816
As many of you know,

325
00:11:30.817 --> 00:11:32.985
our beloved Princess Penelope

326
00:11:32.986 --> 00:11:34.945
died earlier this month

327
00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:36.594
after 17 years

328
00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.240
of devoted service.

329
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.243
Why, that's almost a hundred

330
00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:43.496
in cat years,

331
00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:45.228
and almost 200

332
00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:46.957
in mascot years.

333
00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.960
But, sometimes,

334
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:50.961
the passing of a loved one

335
00:11:50.962 --> 00:11:53.671
gives one the opportunity

336
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.216
to rethink your branding

337
00:11:55.217 --> 00:11:56.758
strategy, which is why

338
00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.407
I am proud to introduce

339
00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:00.053
to you all

340
00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:01.868
York Boys Academy Cougars'

341
00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:03.681
new mascot,

342
00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.310
Princess Murdertooth!

343
00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:13.214
Oh, dude!

344
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.620
A bowl of pudding?

345
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:28.041
Curse you, Macdonald Hall!

346
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.509
Who has an actual,

347
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.926
real live cougar

348
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.428
as their mascot? Why?

349
00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:43.390
- Because they are called
- the Cougars, right?


350
00:12:43.393 --> 00:12:45.017
Fun fact: cougars

351
00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:46.642
aren't considered big cats.

352
00:12:46.643 --> 00:12:47.936
They fall into the same family

353
00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:49.228
as housecats.

354
00:12:49.229 --> 00:12:51.064
- Fun fact:
- you can't talk about fun facts


355
00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:53.066
- When you're dead!
- That's a technicality.


356
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:54.442
What do we do?

357
00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:55.817
We calm down. We calm down.

358
00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:57.278
It's perfectly secure

359
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.736
inside its cage.

360
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:05.328
OK, it's...

361
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:06.704
it's perfectly secure

362
00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:08.539
inside the van.

363
00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:15.964
You were saying?

364
00:13:15.965 --> 00:13:17.339
What the...

365
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.675
That cougar's

366
00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:20.008
a terrible driver!

367
00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:21.615
He's definitely not keeping

368
00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:23.220
his hands at ten and two!

369
00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:25.180
Let's go, we gotta get it!

370
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.726
Come on!

371
00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:31.395
- The surprisingly
- low speed chase ended


372
00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:33.106
with animal control officers

373
00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:34.814
tranquilizing the animal.

374
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:35.983
Charged with one count

375
00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:37.150
of purchasing

376
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:39.028
a banned exotic animal

377
00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.904
is Thomas J. Hartley,

378
00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:42.198
headmaster of the now

379
00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:43.490
formerly prestigious

380
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:46.160
York Boys Academy, who faces

381
00:13:46.161 --> 00:13:48.828
disciplinary action.

382
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.123
Headmaster Hartley

383
00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:51.416
lost his job today.

384
00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:54.335
We're sorry.

385
00:13:54.338 --> 00:13:56.254
Because your shenanigans

386
00:13:56.257 --> 00:13:57.985
Brought to light his black

387
00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.715
market animal purchase.

388
00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:02.134
Uh, you're welcome?

389
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.264
Boys, since you've both been

390
00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:08.348
together here at the Hall,

391
00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:10.039
you've found yourselves in no

392
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.727
small amount of trouble, hm?

393
00:14:11.728 --> 00:14:13.480
Pancake launcher,

394
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:15.230
illegal road tolls,

395
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:16.483
underground tunnel to the local

396
00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:17.733
movie theater...

397
00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:19.151
Attempted tunnel,

398
00:14:19.152 --> 00:14:20.694
sir.

399
00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:22.446
Oh, I stand corrected.

400
00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:24.366
What Bruno means is that

401
00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:26.283
we will graciously accept

402
00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:27.702
whatever punishment

403
00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:29.119
you think is fair.

404
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.080
No, actually, I think the time

405
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:33.039
for punishment is over.

406
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.855
I think for the sake of the Hall

407
00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:36.669
and its legal bills...

408
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.546
We need to have a change.

409
00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:42.341
We punish you?

410
00:14:42.342 --> 00:14:44.302
- Do some kind
- of yard work?


411
00:14:44.305 --> 00:14:45.491
Keep in mind, I burn easy.

412
00:14:45.492 --> 00:14:46.679
I'm less concerned

413
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.889
- about punishing you for the past
- and more interested


414
00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:50.433
- In preparing
- you for the future.


415
00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:52.435
- What future?
- A future where you're no longer


416
00:14:52.438 --> 00:14:53.893
At the Hall.

417
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.563
- Or living together,
- for that matter.


418
00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:57.063
Actually, sir,

419
00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:58.941
- I have a plan for that.
- I'm sure you do, O'Neal,


420
00:14:58.944 --> 00:15:00.360
But a big part of growing up

421
00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:01.777
is adapting to change,

422
00:15:01.778 --> 00:15:03.321
and it's my job to ensure that

423
00:15:03.322 --> 00:15:04.863
you're up for the challenge.

424
00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:06.553
Which is why,

425
00:15:06.554 --> 00:15:08.241
effective immediately,

426
00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:11.161
I'm separating the two of you.

427
00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:12.559
That's...

428
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.955
No...

429
00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.229
No, sir, that's...

430
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.500
Okay, um,

431
00:15:16.501 --> 00:15:17.898
let's just talk this through...

432
00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:19.294
No need.

433
00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:21.839
My decision's final.

434
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.424
- I know it's gonna take some
- adjusting,


435
00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:24.925
- But I'm sure
- you'll be up to it.


436
00:15:24.928 --> 00:15:26.594
- What if we're not
- up for it?


437
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:27.783
What happens then? Have you

438
00:15:27.784 --> 00:15:28.971
even thought about that?

439
00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:32.183
I very, very strongly suggest

440
00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:33.767
you find a way, O'Neal,

441
00:15:33.768 --> 00:15:35.249
because if you don't,

442
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.729
you'll find yourself

443
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.481
not at the Hall much longer.

444
00:15:39.482 --> 00:15:41.983
Yes, sir.

445
00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:43.319
I know this is gonna be

446
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.653
difficult, but I truly believe

447
00:15:44.654 --> 00:15:45.864
it'll do you both good

448
00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:47.072
to see what you're capable of

449
00:15:47.073 --> 00:15:48.699
separately.

450
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.264
So, as of right now, no more

451
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:51.827
classes, no more clubs,

452
00:15:51.828 --> 00:15:54.621
no more roommates.

453
00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:56.207
No more

454
00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:57.792
Bruno and Boots.

455
00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:12.891
Ms. Davis dropped these off.

456
00:16:12.892 --> 00:16:14.433
Our new roommate assignments.

457
00:16:14.434 --> 00:16:16.185
- We should probably
- get it over with.


458
00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:17.937
- I wanna give you
- something first.


459
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.731
Dude!

460
00:16:20.732 --> 00:16:23.066
My party shades! Ha!

461
00:16:23.067 --> 00:16:26.361
Uh... oh! Here.

462
00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:27.864
My lucky puck.

463
00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:30.929
Isn't this the puck that

464
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.991
hit you in the stomach?

465
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.368
Yep, but it's lucky

466
00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:34.516
because it didn't nail me

467
00:16:34.517 --> 00:16:35.663
anywhere lower.

468
00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.628
What's wrong, man?

469
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:43.587
I've never seen you like this.

470
00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:46.590
I'm not good with change.

471
00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:48.343
My parents once painted my room

472
00:16:48.344 --> 00:16:50.093
without telling me...

473
00:16:50.094 --> 00:16:51.095
I didn't sleep

474
00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:52.096
for a month, Bruno.

475
00:16:52.097 --> 00:16:54.161
Don't be scared.

476
00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:56.224
Here, look. Come here.

477
00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:58.226
You take the smoothie station.

478
00:16:58.227 --> 00:16:59.958
Okay? I'll be fine.

479
00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:01.688
That's just it! 
You'll be fine!

480
00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:03.942
- You're Bruno Walton, you always
- land on your feet!


481
00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:05.110
You've got

482
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:06.276
a plan! What do I have?

483
00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:07.987
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right, I do.


484
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.405
And so... here.

485
00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:12.346
You take your half, I'll take

486
00:17:12.347 --> 00:17:14.284
mine. Hang on to that.

487
00:17:14.285 --> 00:17:15.703
We're gonna be making cheddar

488
00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:17.120
and bacon smoothies in no time.

489
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.665
Yeah, I actually hate those.

490
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:21.959
I promise you.

491
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.085
Alright.

492
00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:25.984
How weird can our roommate

493
00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:27.882
assignments actually be, right?

494
00:17:34.013 --> 00:17:35.555
Yeah, that weird.

495
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.814
- Don't you have
- your own hazmat suit?


496
00:17:43.815 --> 00:17:45.148
Pardon?

497
00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:46.672
Don't you have

498
00:17:46.673 --> 00:17:48.193
your own hazmat suit?

499
00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:50.904
Uh, no? Should I?

500
00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.866
- Opening a window
- should suffice.


501
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:55.075
Welcome, roomie.

502
00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:59.830
Lot of stuff and gear, Elmer.

503
00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:01.665
And why is it so creepy?

504
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:02.709
My world is the world

505
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.750
of science,

506
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:04.878
the world of knowledge

507
00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:06.003
and discovery.

508
00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:07.922
- Yeah, okay, but where
- did the last guy live?


509
00:18:07.925 --> 00:18:09.361
For some reason, he elected

510
00:18:09.362 --> 00:18:10.799
to live in a box. On the roof!

511
00:18:12.657 --> 00:18:14.511
I can't imagine why.

512
00:18:15.535 --> 00:18:16.555
My synthetic mucus!

513
00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:18.225
Oh, sorry! I did not

514
00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:19.892
mean to... wow.

515
00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:21.478
That is a new smell.

516
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:23.061
I can see we're going to have

517
00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:25.481
- to establish some ground rules.
- Let me start with a list


518
00:18:25.484 --> 00:18:27.733
Of things you shouldn't touch.

519
00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:29.006
Test tubes, beakers,

520
00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.276
petri dishes,

521
00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:31.592
anything on the primary

522
00:18:31.593 --> 00:18:32.905
or secondary science tables,

523
00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:34.470
likewise my pheromones

524
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:36.033
of the animal kingdom,

525
00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:37.243
and you do not wanna touch

526
00:18:37.244 --> 00:18:38.451
any of the slime molds

527
00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:40.246
in the specimen fridge.

528
00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:42.603
OK, but what about

529
00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:43.665
the blueberry yogurt?

530
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:45.668
What blueberry yogurt?

531
00:19:05.522 --> 00:19:06.688
Hi. This is...

532
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:10.149
- Mr. O'Neal, welcome.
- Mr. Wexford-Smith III


533
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.798
has been expecting you.

534
00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:13.446
He has?

535
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.668
Is this room bigger

536
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:30.067
on the inside?

537
00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.463
Considerably.

538
00:19:31.464 --> 00:19:33.715
But well worth the expense.

539
00:19:33.716 --> 00:19:36.094
Murray, if you please?

540
00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.847
Good to have you on board.

541
00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:41.995
So you're outsourcing

542
00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.141
handshakes now.

543
00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:44.601
I was a skeptic,

544
00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:46.604
until I ran the numbers.

545
00:19:46.605 --> 00:19:48.605
Welcome to your new home.

546
00:19:48.606 --> 00:19:50.816
Non-disclosure agreement.

547
00:19:50.817 --> 00:19:51.902
You shouldn't have.

548
00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:52.985
Well, living here,

549
00:19:52.986 --> 00:19:54.300
you may be privy to trade

550
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:55.612
secrets, cap and trade policies,

551
00:19:55.613 --> 00:19:56.656
etc. etc.

552
00:19:56.657 --> 00:19:57.697
Most of all...

553
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.659
I love the smell of contracts

554
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.828
in the morning.

555
00:20:02.829 --> 00:20:05.580
I need to lie down.

556
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.582
Where do you sleep?

557
00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:11.795
Sleep?

558
00:20:11.796 --> 00:20:13.214
And miss a day's trade

559
00:20:13.215 --> 00:20:14.631
or the Tokyo Stock Exchange?

560
00:20:14.632 --> 00:20:16.467
No, no, no, no. That's

561
00:20:16.468 --> 00:20:18.301
Murray's job now, old fence.

562
00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:21.680
I'm sorry, but I need a bed

563
00:20:21.681 --> 00:20:23.640
to sleep in, to study in,

564
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:25.643
- to sleep in while pretending
- to be studying...


565
00:20:25.646 --> 00:20:27.353
- This is not gonna work,
- I'm sorry.


566
00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:28.854
Relax, old sock.

567
00:20:28.855 --> 00:20:30.085
We have you all settled.

568
00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:31.314
Right over here.

569
00:20:34.694 --> 00:20:36.820
You'll be snug as a bug.

570
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:38.823
- I mean, of course I'll expect
- you to clean out


571
00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:40.304
By start of business hours

572
00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.783
each AM, but until then,

573
00:20:41.784 --> 00:20:43.368
welcome home.

574
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.287
Ah! That's my 6:50.

575
00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:17.944
Hey!

576
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:20.238
So you deciphered my code.

577
00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:21.428
A picture of the place

578
00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:22.615
we're secretly meeting at

579
00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:23.638
doesn't really

580
00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:24.659
qualify as a code.

581
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.619
So, how's living with George?

582
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.768
Is it true that his room's

583
00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:28.914
actually some company?

584
00:21:28.915 --> 00:21:30.041
Yeah, no, I sleep

585
00:21:30.042 --> 00:21:31.166
next to the photocopier.

586
00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:33.169
- And it's not so much sleep
- as I close my eyes


587
00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:34.253
For ten seconds before

588
00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:35.336
somebody prints something.

589
00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.090
- Well, um,
- I found


590
00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:38.133
One of Elmer's carnivorous

591
00:21:38.134 --> 00:21:39.174
centipedes in my bed.

592
00:21:39.175 --> 00:21:40.468
Don't ask why I know

593
00:21:40.469 --> 00:21:41.760
it's carnivorous.

594
00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:43.826
I'm glad at least one of us is

595
00:21:43.827 --> 00:21:45.889
getting a kick out of all this.

596
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.849
Wait a minute.

597
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.268
I know that smirk.

598
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:50.685
You've got a plan.

599
00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:52.167
Why else would I call you here?

600
00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:53.646
OK, well, make it quick.

601
00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:54.669
If The Fish catches us

602
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.690
together, we're through.

603
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:57.902
- Should I get the guys together - for a meeting?
- No, no.


604
00:21:57.905 --> 00:21:59.571
Actually, this plan kinda means

605
00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:01.238
doing the exact opposite.

606
00:22:01.239 --> 00:22:02.948
Normally,

607
00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:04.388
we ask our friends for a bit

608
00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.825
of help, right? This time,

609
00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:07.077
our friends are gonna help us

610
00:22:07.078 --> 00:22:08.327
without them even knowing.

611
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.830
We're about to become

612
00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:11.330
the worst roommates

613
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:13.063
in the history

614
00:22:13.064 --> 00:22:14.793
of rooms... or mates.

615
00:22:14.794 --> 00:22:18.631
I call it Operation Doommates.

616
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:21.967
Then Sturgeon threw some butter

617
00:22:21.968 --> 00:22:23.384
and someone threw some icing in,

618
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:24.762
and then it just turned into

619
00:22:24.763 --> 00:22:26.138
this huge epic food fight

620
00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:27.786
right on stage.

621
00:22:27.787 --> 00:22:29.432
Such tales of waste, Bruno!

622
00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:30.747
You could've fed

623
00:22:30.748 --> 00:22:32.060
dozens instead!

624
00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:33.771
Macdonald Hall

625
00:22:33.772 --> 00:22:35.480
is a dream school.

626
00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:37.690
Every day, it's zany antics.

627
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:38.985
What are you doing?

628
00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:40.277
Oh, just talking to Francisco,

629
00:22:40.278 --> 00:22:41.759
your Malbonian video pen pal.

630
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.238
Hey, Elmer!

631
00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:44.365
Yeah, my Malbonian

632
00:22:44.366 --> 00:22:45.490
video pen pal!

633
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:47.180
Hey, Franny, you should

634
00:22:47.181 --> 00:22:48.868
totally come to the Hall!

635
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:49.933
You know, maybe there's,

636
00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:50.996
like, an exchange or...

637
00:22:50.997 --> 00:22:52.831
No! No, no, no, no, no!

638
00:22:52.832 --> 00:22:54.187
Come to MacDonald Hall?

639
00:22:54.188 --> 00:22:55.541
Where students sell doorknobs

640
00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:57.543
and don't go to jail?

641
00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:58.962
Where are my test tubes?

642
00:22:58.963 --> 00:23:00.379
Ah man, you know what?

643
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.381
The charity drive came by today.

644
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:03.467
They must have taken it.

645
00:23:03.468 --> 00:23:04.550
Bruno, those were

646
00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:05.719
highly concentrated

647
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.886
skunk pheromones

648
00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:08.345
I was collecting for a year!

649
00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:09.556
If one of those

650
00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:10.765
test tubes breaks,

651
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:11.872
it'll be skunk mating

652
00:23:11.873 --> 00:23:12.976
season for months!

653
00:23:12.977 --> 00:23:14.124
Elmer, I'm sorry,

654
00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:15.270
I had no idea.

655
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.607
What is that?

656
00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:21.651
Oh, Mr. Captain Cuddles?

657
00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:24.030
- I've had him for like ten years.
- Have you guys not met?


658
00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:25.989
Wherever he goes, I go.

659
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.740
Isn't that right, Mr. Cuddles?

660
00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:29.222
Aren't you cute?

661
00:23:29.223 --> 00:23:30.703
Look at you, you're so cute!

662
00:23:32.788 --> 00:23:34.873
Well, you can rest assured,

663
00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:36.167
because when it comes to

664
00:23:36.168 --> 00:23:37.458
collateralized debt obligations,

665
00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.544
I happen to be

666
00:23:38.545 --> 00:23:39.627
a bit of an expert.

667
00:23:40.964 --> 00:23:42.297
Hello? Hello?

668
00:23:42.298 --> 00:23:45.675
Hello? What are you doing?

669
00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:49.221
This simply cannot be!

670
00:23:49.222 --> 00:23:51.597
Oh, sorry, George.

671
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:52.954
I gotta be ready for

672
00:23:52.955 --> 00:23:54.309
the Junior Jazz Ensemble.

673
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.436
The show is only

674
00:23:55.437 --> 00:23:56.561
three months away!

675
00:23:56.562 --> 00:23:58.043
This just

676
00:23:58.044 --> 00:23:59.522
cost me a client!

677
00:23:59.523 --> 00:24:01.566
I'll try and play as quietly

678
00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:04.070
as I possibly can.

679
00:24:08.615 --> 00:24:10.910
See? It's like

680
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:13.203
I'm not even here!

681
00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:16.332
Ms. Davis? Ms. Davis!

682
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.606
[GEORGE AND ELMER

683
00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:24.757
It was so loud I could

684
00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:26.050
feel it in my chest!

685
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:30.554
- I can't believe
- this is working.


686
00:24:30.557 --> 00:24:31.660
Hey, I made a promise,

687
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:32.764
didn't I?

688
00:24:32.765 --> 00:24:33.808
Rinse and repeat until

689
00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:34.849
we're roomies again.

690
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.602
Alright, alright, alright!

691
00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:38.353
Take it easy, Einstein!

692
00:24:38.354 --> 00:24:39.417
Don't get your fifties

693
00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:40.479
in a knot. Here.

694
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.565
Fill out these roommate

695
00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:42.648
request forms.

696
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:44.464
Now you need to

697
00:24:44.465 --> 00:24:46.279
build up an appetite.

698
00:24:54.287 --> 00:24:59.374
♪ I stick to you like glue ♪

699
00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:01.043
♪ You're my weekend

700
00:25:01.044 --> 00:25:02.710
I like what you did ♪

701
00:25:04.423 --> 00:25:06.131
'Sup, roomie?

702
00:25:06.132 --> 00:25:07.299
Hey, this isn't

703
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.466
your food, is it?

704
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.595
This isn't gonna work out.

705
00:25:19.103 --> 00:25:22.230
Um, you boys wouldn't be

706
00:25:22.231 --> 00:25:23.754
intentionally bad fits for all

707
00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.275
your new roommates, would you?

708
00:25:25.276 --> 00:25:27.028
Mr. Sturgeon, I can honestly

709
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:28.778
say we would be terrible fits

710
00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:30.322
with anybody.

711
00:25:30.323 --> 00:25:31.864
We're trying our best, sir.

712
00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:33.783
Ah, don't worry.

713
00:25:33.784 --> 00:25:35.411
There are over 300 new boys

714
00:25:35.412 --> 00:25:37.037
for you to try harder with.

715
00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:48.174
Operation Doommates just got

716
00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:50.008
a "snore-midable" improvement.

717
00:25:56.329 --> 00:25:57.807
You gotta be kidding me!

718
00:25:59.332 --> 00:26:00.852
- Aw, man! Come on,
- be quiet, let me sleep!


719
00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:02.313
Incoming.

720
00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:12.198
Here we go again.

721
00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:33.052
Do angels live here?

722
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.606
No, I don't drink tea.

723
00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:50.132
Actually, you know,

724
00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:51.904
I'll give it a try.

725
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:59.119
Ah! Thank you.

726
00:27:16.387 --> 00:27:18.097
Man, I've been on fire!

727
00:27:18.098 --> 00:27:19.805
Bro, most of these kids

728
00:27:19.806 --> 00:27:21.350
- don't even last
- a single night with me!


729
00:27:21.353 --> 00:27:22.727
Carlos, done.

730
00:27:22.728 --> 00:27:24.102
Brian J., done.

731
00:27:24.103 --> 00:27:25.396
That Gordon kid that never

732
00:27:25.397 --> 00:27:26.687
stopped typing, done.

733
00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:27.961
Wow! That's great,

734
00:27:27.962 --> 00:27:29.232
man, really.

735
00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:31.110
- If you've been
- keeping up with me,


736
00:27:31.113 --> 00:27:32.382
We have got to be through most

737
00:27:32.383 --> 00:27:33.652
of the roommate options by now.

738
00:27:33.653 --> 00:27:34.947
Gimme your names,

739
00:27:34.948 --> 00:27:36.239
I'll cross them off.

740
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.658
I'm... kind of still

741
00:27:37.659 --> 00:27:39.075
living with Chris.

742
00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:40.828
What? Dude, it's been

743
00:27:40.829 --> 00:27:42.579
over a week!

744
00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.829
Doesn't he drive you crazy,

745
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.499
- always never talking,
- always so quiet?


746
00:27:45.502 --> 00:27:47.166
Well...

747
00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:48.836
Mumsie, look! The Duke of

748
00:27:48.837 --> 00:27:50.503
Bermondsey's driving a lorry,

749
00:27:50.504 --> 00:27:52.089
and he's wearing a jumper!

750
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.672
Cheerio!

751
00:27:53.673 --> 00:27:56.509
So he really is British.

752
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.386
Super British.

753
00:27:58.387 --> 00:28:00.637
Dude, it's been over a week!

754
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:01.911
Meanwhile, I've been

755
00:28:01.912 --> 00:28:03.182
burning through roommates

756
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:04.455
like sulfuric acid

757
00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:05.726
burns through iron.

758
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:06.958
I think I still have

759
00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:08.187
some residual Elmer on me.

760
00:28:08.188 --> 00:28:09.753
I know, but Chris

761
00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.316
is a good guy.

762
00:28:11.317 --> 00:28:12.318
I don't know, I kinda

763
00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:13.319
like living with him.

764
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.862
What's wrong? Do you need a

765
00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:16.404
hand? 'Cause I can come by...

766
00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:17.969
No, no. Tonight's

767
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.532
- watercolor night.
- Excuse me?


768
00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:20.701
I... it's

769
00:28:20.702 --> 00:28:21.867
just a thing...

770
00:28:21.868 --> 00:28:23.660
that we do. Obviously,

771
00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:25.705
- I didn't have the greatest
- technique at first,


772
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:26.727
But he really helped me

773
00:28:26.728 --> 00:28:27.748
work on my brush strokes

774
00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:28.958
and my use of negative space,

775
00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:30.002
and the whole thing

776
00:28:30.003 --> 00:28:31.043
just came to...

777
00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:32.920
What?

778
00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:34.880
I like painting!

779
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:36.049
Whatever. We just need

780
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.216
to stick to the plan.

781
00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:39.136
- Don't you think that maybe
- we've been taking


782
00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:40.971
- Some of this
- Doommate stuff pretty far?


783
00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:42.680
You'll get over it, dude.

784
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:43.786
All we're doing is slightly

785
00:28:43.787 --> 00:28:44.890
annoying people

786
00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:46.476
for a good cause. We're like

787
00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:48.060
mosquitoes who recycle.

788
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:49.563
Well, maybe I don't

789
00:28:49.564 --> 00:28:51.064
wanna be Chris' mosquito.

790
00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:54.026
Are you forgetting why

791
00:28:54.027 --> 00:28:55.485
we're doing this, dude?

792
00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:56.758
You know, "I can't

793
00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:58.029
handle change, Bruno!

794
00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.198
Help me, Bruno! I'm

795
00:28:59.199 --> 00:29:00.365
nothing without you!"

796
00:29:00.366 --> 00:29:01.972
Okay, I remember the first two,

797
00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.576
not so sure about the last one.

798
00:29:03.577 --> 00:29:05.161
I know what you meant.

799
00:29:05.162 --> 00:29:06.726
Anyways, don't you still

800
00:29:06.727 --> 00:29:08.289
wanna live together?

801
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.084
Of course!

802
00:29:10.085 --> 00:29:11.876
I swear. Just...

803
00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:13.316
maybe we should take a break

804
00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:14.753
for a couple days, you know,

805
00:29:14.754 --> 00:29:15.755
make sure we still have

806
00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:16.756
some friends left.

807
00:29:16.757 --> 00:29:18.258
I suppose next you'll want me

808
00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:19.758
to give back Elmer's pheromones.

809
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.760
Hey!

810
00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:23.972
That's the spirit! C'mon!

811
00:29:25.474 --> 00:29:27.226
Let's go.

812
00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:36.776
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing here? I...


813
00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:38.403
Elmer's pheromones, please.

814
00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:39.676
There's three words that

815
00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:40.946
should never go together.

816
00:29:42.471 --> 00:29:43.991
- Have you tried
- buying him dinner?


817
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:45.286
What happened

818
00:29:45.287 --> 00:29:46.578
to Operation Doommates?

819
00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:48.454
Thank you.

820
00:29:48.455 --> 00:29:49.644
But he's been practicing

821
00:29:49.645 --> 00:29:50.831
his brush stroke technique.

822
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:54.043
Not to be a drama llama,

823
00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:55.379
but are you guys okay?

824
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.713
Never better.

825
00:29:56.714 --> 00:29:58.507
- I'll take that.
- No, you need


826
00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.696
To get back to Chris.

827
00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:00.883
I said I got it.

828
00:30:00.884 --> 00:30:02.261
You don't trust me now?

829
00:30:02.262 --> 00:30:03.636
Come on, dude, gimme the phero...

830
00:30:04.763 --> 00:30:06.556
Ugh, that stuff reeks!

831
00:30:06.557 --> 00:30:07.642
We are so sorry. We will

832
00:30:07.643 --> 00:30:08.725
- stay and clean up.
- Uh, no.


833
00:30:08.726 --> 00:30:10.851
We have no time.

834
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:12.229
We have to get you back

835
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.606
to that canvas. 
See you, gals!

836
00:30:15.441 --> 00:30:16.796
Okay...

837
00:30:16.797 --> 00:30:18.150
Uh...

838
00:30:18.151 --> 00:30:19.902
Are you serious?

839
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:21.697
- So they can use a little
- air freshener!


840
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.948
What's the worst that

841
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:24.198
could actually happen?

842
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:26.825
Uh... that?

843
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:33.333
And that.

844
00:30:34.543 --> 00:30:35.982
We should go.

845
00:30:35.983 --> 00:30:37.421
Really should.

846
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:52.916
Boys, a couple of things

847
00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:54.771
have come to my attention.

848
00:30:54.772 --> 00:30:56.439
Oh...

849
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.422
Uh, I think what Boots

850
00:30:59.423 --> 00:31:02.403
meant to say was, uh, "Oh?"

851
00:31:02.404 --> 00:31:03.927
Let's begin with how

852
00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:05.448
incompatible you both seem to be

853
00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:06.888
with virtually

854
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:08.326
every other boy in dorm 1.

855
00:31:08.327 --> 00:31:09.599
Yeah, it's a real shame.

856
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.869
I feel like I could room

857
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.268
with anyone, but I don't know,

858
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:13.665
I guess the other guys just...

859
00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:14.813
don't feel the

860
00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:15.958
same way about me.

861
00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:18.419
Yeah... ditto.

862
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.318
Hm. It's almost as if the only

863
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:22.214
people you two can live with

864
00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:24.216
are... the two of you.

865
00:31:24.217 --> 00:31:26.512
Almost, sir.

866
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:31.600
Except for one little wrinkle.

867
00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:35.166
The plan to separate you is

868
00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:37.062
working. Boots' marks are up 6%.

869
00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:39.482
Really? That's great!

870
00:31:39.483 --> 00:31:41.485
But 6% is not that much.

871
00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:43.486
It's enough for me to think

872
00:31:43.487 --> 00:31:44.946
- that separating you was
- a good idea.


873
00:31:44.949 --> 00:31:46.699
- I'm tempted
- to keep it that way for good.


874
00:31:46.702 --> 00:31:48.054
But that's not part

875
00:31:48.055 --> 00:31:49.408
of the plan. I mean, uh...

876
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:51.076
I mean... no...

877
00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:52.495
Not like we have a plan.

878
00:31:52.496 --> 00:31:53.912
Or I had a plan.

879
00:31:53.913 --> 00:31:56.040
What plan?

880
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:57.689
Well, regardless,

881
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.335
there's another little wrinkle

882
00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:00.817
that's going to affect the way

883
00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:02.296
we all live for a while.

884
00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:03.507
Something happened at

885
00:32:03.508 --> 00:32:04.716
Scrimmage's last night.

886
00:32:04.717 --> 00:32:06.967
Oh... I mean,

887
00:32:06.968 --> 00:32:08.678
oh?

888
00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:11.494
Yeah, massive skunk damage. Some

889
00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:14.308
kind of skunk mating frenzy.

890
00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:16.436
- Carpets have to be ripped out,
- wood replaced...


891
00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:18.230
- The air quality alone means
- it's going to be


892
00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:19.939
- Uninhabitable
- for months.


893
00:32:19.942 --> 00:32:21.003
I guess you already

894
00:32:21.004 --> 00:32:22.066
know that we...

895
00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:23.485
- Would have no choice
- but to invite


896
00:32:23.488 --> 00:32:24.507
Our neighbors here

897
00:32:24.508 --> 00:32:25.528
in their time of need.

898
00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:26.822
P... pardon?

899
00:32:26.823 --> 00:32:28.114
Say what now?

900
00:32:30.116 --> 00:32:31.951
- Attention,
- Macdonald Hall students,


901
00:32:31.954 --> 00:32:32.994
This is

902
00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:34.036
Headmaster Sturgeon.

903
00:32:34.037 --> 00:32:35.727
Macdonald Hall's mission is

904
00:32:35.728 --> 00:32:37.415
to ensure each of you grow up

905
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:39.625
to be functioning adults,

906
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:40.877
and also understand

907
00:32:40.878 --> 00:32:42.127
that change,

908
00:32:42.128 --> 00:32:43.526
however difficult,

909
00:32:43.527 --> 00:32:44.922
can also be a good thing,

910
00:32:44.923 --> 00:32:46.404
especially when it means

911
00:32:46.405 --> 00:32:47.884
being a good citizen

912
00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:49.343
and a good neighbor.

913
00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:50.387
There will be some new

914
00:32:50.388 --> 00:32:51.429
faces in this school,

915
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.765
and possibly for the rest

916
00:32:52.766 --> 00:32:54.098
of the year,

917
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:55.768
because Macdonald Hall is now

918
00:32:55.769 --> 00:32:57.435
the new temporary home

919
00:32:57.436 --> 00:32:59.521
of Scrimmage Academy.

920
00:33:01.607 --> 00:33:02.942
Please welcome our guests,

921
00:33:02.943 --> 00:33:04.275
while giving them

922
00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:06.111
- what little space
- we can offer.


923
00:33:06.114 --> 00:33:08.113
- Although their classes
- and living quarters


924
00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:10.032
Will remain separate, we'll all

925
00:33:10.033 --> 00:33:11.949
be under the same roof.

926
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.348
Maybe we should take our

927
00:33:13.349 --> 00:33:14.744
chances with the skunks.

928
00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:16.101
It smells like

929
00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:17.456
grandpas in here.

930
00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:21.230
Come on, Diane.

931
00:33:21.231 --> 00:33:23.294
So let's all rise

932
00:33:23.295 --> 00:33:25.047
to the challenge of this

933
00:33:25.048 --> 00:33:26.798
temporary change, shall we,

934
00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.718
and embrace the opportunity

935
00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:30.635
to grow and to learn.

936
00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:31.950
Thank you.

937
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:33.262
Wow.

938
00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:34.348
So what does this mean?

939
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:35.431
Uh, it means that space

940
00:33:35.432 --> 00:33:36.746
is now very limited,

941
00:33:36.747 --> 00:33:38.058
so no more room changes.

942
00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:39.332
Compatibility is a luxury

943
00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:40.603
we can no longer afford.

944
00:33:40.604 --> 00:33:42.147
But our... our room!

945
00:33:42.148 --> 00:33:43.689
Your room is now...

946
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.233
Ah!

947
00:33:46.234 --> 00:33:47.882
Scrimmage's Therapeutic

948
00:33:47.883 --> 00:33:49.528
Bubble Wrap Room.

949
00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:50.635
Apparently, popping

950
00:33:50.636 --> 00:33:51.739
bubbles is a keystone

951
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.866
of her curriculum.

952
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:53.991
I'm sorry, boys,

953
00:33:53.992 --> 00:33:55.911
- you won't be living together
- anytime soon,


954
00:33:55.914 --> 00:33:57.746
- Not until things
- are back to normal. Clear?


955
00:33:57.749 --> 00:33:59.185
Yes, sir. This

956
00:33:59.186 --> 00:34:00.623
certainly brings everything

957
00:34:00.624 --> 00:34:02.167
into perspective.

958
00:34:02.168 --> 00:34:03.709
Oh, does it now?

959
00:34:04.921 --> 00:34:06.128
Hello! Make way! Hello!

960
00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:08.923
Coming through! 
Oh, watch out!

961
00:34:08.924 --> 00:34:11.467
Oh, hello!

962
00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:14.136
Eugenia... I mean Ms. Scrimmage,

963
00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:15.847
what are you doing here?

964
00:34:15.848 --> 00:34:17.556
Hello, office mate.

965
00:34:17.557 --> 00:34:19.475
May I just say

966
00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:20.498
that your generosity

967
00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:21.519
is an inspiration,

968
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.938
and quite unexpected. Oh!

969
00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:25.898
So much possibility in here.

970
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.942
All of this... gone.

971
00:34:27.943 --> 00:34:29.382
Uh, you're moving

972
00:34:29.383 --> 00:34:30.820
into my office?

973
00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:32.323
Well, as headmistress, I need

974
00:34:32.324 --> 00:34:33.823
a nexus of concentration,

975
00:34:33.824 --> 00:34:35.284
and if the boys and girls

976
00:34:35.285 --> 00:34:36.742
can share the school,

977
00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:37.744
surely you and I

978
00:34:37.745 --> 00:34:38.745
can share one room.

979
00:34:38.746 --> 00:34:40.059
How would you say that the

980
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.372
energy flows best in this room...

981
00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:43.916
This way, or this way?

982
00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:45.711
Wouldn't you be much happier

983
00:34:45.712 --> 00:34:47.503
in a... oh, I don't know,

984
00:34:47.504 --> 00:34:49.630
a field or a lovely tree?

985
00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:51.590
Ha! No, I would not.

986
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.134
I am not an orangutan.

987
00:34:54.135 --> 00:34:55.470
It's not even

988
00:34:55.471 --> 00:34:56.805
my spirit animal.

989
00:34:59.307 --> 00:35:00.809
Well, we'll let you, uh,

990
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.309
rise to the challenge

991
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.270
and embrace opportunities.

992
00:35:06.398 --> 00:35:07.691
I cannot work without my wind

993
00:35:07.692 --> 00:35:08.983
chimes.

994
00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:10.027
These will change

995
00:35:10.028 --> 00:35:11.069
your life, William.

996
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.907
- So wait, you're
- telling us that you spent


997
00:35:15.908 --> 00:35:17.326
the last month making our lives

998
00:35:17.327 --> 00:35:18.743
a waking nightmare

999
00:35:18.744 --> 00:35:20.016
from which there was

1000
00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.286
no escape, just so you two

1001
00:35:21.287 --> 00:35:23.205
could be roomies again?

1002
00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:24.729
But now you want our help to

1003
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.250
do the same thing to the girls?

1004
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:27.523
Maybe we owe you guys

1005
00:35:27.524 --> 00:35:28.794
an apology.

1006
00:35:28.795 --> 00:35:30.338
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe!


1007
00:35:30.341 --> 00:35:31.757
- And Boots
- is working on that


1008
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.592
- Right now, okay,
- but the bottom line is,


1009
00:35:33.595 --> 00:35:35.531
The longer the girls stay,

1010
00:35:35.532 --> 00:35:37.469
the more Macdonald Hall changes.

1011
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.888
They have got to go.

1012
00:35:38.889 --> 00:35:40.807
- And the girls
- Could not agree more.


1013
00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.768
Don't touch me.

1014
00:35:44.603 --> 00:35:46.854
Wait, really?

1015
00:35:46.855 --> 00:35:47.856
Well, I don't know

1016
00:35:47.857 --> 00:35:48.857
what you guys are serving

1017
00:35:48.858 --> 00:35:49.900
in the buffeteria,

1018
00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:50.942
but it isn't food.

1019
00:35:50.943 --> 00:35:52.736
- And I don't know
- what buffeteria means,


1020
00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:54.152
But it isn't a real word.

1021
00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:56.154
- And one of your teachers
- scolded Diane


1022
00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:58.116
- for digging a hole
- in the schoolyard.


1023
00:35:58.119 --> 00:35:59.368
I was just trying to bury

1024
00:35:59.369 --> 00:36:00.618
my metaphorical inhibitions.

1025
00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:04.956
- Plus-and I mean this
- in the nicest way possible...


1026
00:36:04.957 --> 00:36:06.521
I've smelled fast food dumpsters

1027
00:36:06.522 --> 00:36:08.084
that stink less than you alls.

1028
00:36:08.085 --> 00:36:09.607
That's true.

1029
00:36:09.608 --> 00:36:11.128
That one's fair, actually.

1030
00:36:11.129 --> 00:36:12.504
The gong is ready to go.

1031
00:36:12.505 --> 00:36:14.382
- Oh no, we don't need that
- anymore, Wilbur.


1032
00:36:14.385 --> 00:36:16.216
I actually already have a plan.

1033
00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:19.304
Operation Fake Prank War.

1034
00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:22.140
That's...

1035
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.141
that's brilliant.

1036
00:36:23.142 --> 00:36:24.142
If Sturgeon

1037
00:36:24.143 --> 00:36:25.143
and Scrimmage think

1038
00:36:25.144 --> 00:36:26.541
the boys and the girls can't get

1039
00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:27.937
along, they'll separate us.

1040
00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:30.107
- Scrimmage will find us somewhere
- else to stay


1041
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.733
- While the school
- gets de-skunked.


1042
00:36:31.736 --> 00:36:33.089
A motel, a trailer park,

1043
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.443
a ditch... anything would be

1044
00:36:34.444 --> 00:36:36.029
an improvement. No offense.

1045
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.613
Guys,

1046
00:36:37.614 --> 00:36:40.282
do I have to remind you?

1047
00:36:40.283 --> 00:36:41.722
Bruno's plans don't

1048
00:36:41.723 --> 00:36:43.160
always go as...

1049
00:36:43.161 --> 00:36:45.412
planned.

1050
00:36:45.413 --> 00:36:47.539
He's right.

1051
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.334
Sometimes they go better.

1052
00:36:50.335 --> 00:36:51.753
Alright, let's go!

1053
00:36:51.754 --> 00:36:53.170
Yeah!

1054
00:36:53.171 --> 00:36:55.048
- Okay, let's just remember
- the ground rules.


1055
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:56.800
- That's right,
- where there are no rules,


1056
00:36:56.803 --> 00:36:58.426
- Only losers and winners.

Right?

- This prank is going

Guys! Guys, look!

1171
00:40:48.573 --> 00:40:49.825
Who would leave

1172
00:40:49.826 --> 00:40:51.076

No, no, no!

What?

1175
00:41:01.753 --> 00:41:03.379
Nuts.

Now, Mr. Sturgeon and I

1177
00:41:05.965 --> 00:41:07.446
understand that this has been

1178
00:41:07.447 --> 00:41:08.926
a difficult time.

1179
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.677
Actually, "we" don't.

1180
00:41:12.223 --> 00:41:13.764
- I think what William
- is trying to say


1181
00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:15.308
is that we feel

1182
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:16.850
your confusion.

1183
00:41:16.851 --> 00:41:19.103
Hmm... no, I'm not.

1184
00:41:19.104 --> 00:41:21.064
I'm too busy feeling

1185
00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:23.023
very, very pink.

1186
00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:24.213
Sir, I think I can

1187
00:41:24.214 --> 00:41:25.401
speak for all of us

1188
00:41:25.402 --> 00:41:26.507
when I say pink is

1189
00:41:26.508 --> 00:41:27.611
definitely your color.

1190
00:41:27.612 --> 00:41:29.572
- And I think I can speak
- for all of us when I say


1191
00:41:29.575 --> 00:41:31.095
This is entirely Bruno's fault.

1192
00:41:31.096 --> 00:41:32.616
My fault?

1193
00:41:32.617 --> 00:41:33.660
Who was the one who put

1194
00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:34.701
all the moustaches

1195
00:41:34.702 --> 00:41:35.703
and wigs all over Chris'

1196
00:41:35.704 --> 00:41:36.704
masterpieces?

1197
00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.893
Well, who's the one that

1198
00:41:37.894 --> 00:41:39.081
painted the entire staircase

1199
00:41:39.082 --> 00:41:40.188
that I walked into?

1200
00:41:40.189 --> 00:41:41.292
I've still got a headache.

1201
00:41:41.293 --> 00:41:43.170
Oh, I have something for that.

1202
00:41:43.171 --> 00:41:45.045
Where is my wet noise generator?

1203
00:41:45.046 --> 00:41:47.505
Oh, it's drying out.

1204
00:41:47.506 --> 00:41:48.924
On the roof.

1205
00:41:48.925 --> 00:41:50.531
The thing I don't understand

1206
00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:52.136
is... I thought

1207
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:53.180
you all liked each other.

1208
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:54.221
We do.

1209
00:41:54.222 --> 00:41:56.890
I mean, we're friends.

1210
00:41:56.891 --> 00:41:58.435
Arguable.

1211
00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:01.561
Mr. Sturgeon,

1212
00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:03.272
Ms. Scrimmage,

1213
00:42:03.273 --> 00:42:04.962
we only did all this to show you

1214
00:42:04.963 --> 00:42:06.650
that we couldn't get along

1215
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:08.028
so you would split us

1216
00:42:08.029 --> 00:42:09.403
back up and...

1217
00:42:09.404 --> 00:42:10.405
everything would go

1218
00:42:10.406 --> 00:42:11.406
back to normal.

1219
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:13.824
I guess it just...

1220
00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:16.119
got out of hand.

1221
00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:19.414
That is the most...

1222
00:42:19.415 --> 00:42:20.789
Idiotic,

1223
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.167
harebrained, impossible...

1224
00:42:23.168 --> 00:42:25.149
Poignant, understandable,

1225
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.129
beautiful...

1226
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.047
Beautiful...

1227
00:42:29.048 --> 00:42:31.092
- Wait, what?
- Well, William, we're the ones


1228
00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:32.844
Who forced them to do this,

1229
00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:34.594
so this is really our fault.

1230
00:42:34.595 --> 00:42:35.784
Is this really happening?

1231
00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:36.972
Oh, and it gets better.

1232
00:42:36.973 --> 00:42:37.995
Watch.

1233
00:42:37.996 --> 00:42:39.016
Wait a minute.

1234
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:40.539
I'm not the reason I got

1235
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.060
pink powder up my nose.

1236
00:42:42.061 --> 00:42:44.022
Aren't you, William?

1237
00:42:44.023 --> 00:42:45.981
In your heart.

1238
00:42:45.982 --> 00:42:47.234
I think it's time to let

1239
00:42:47.235 --> 00:42:48.484
bygones be bygones.

1240
00:42:48.485 --> 00:42:49.736
We have so much to learn

1241
00:42:49.737 --> 00:42:50.986
from each other...

1242
00:42:50.987 --> 00:42:52.822
which we could do at

1243
00:42:52.823 --> 00:42:54.656
a coed equinox gathering

1244
00:42:54.657 --> 00:42:57.618
of movement and co-mingling!

1245
00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:01.351
I believe what she's trying

1246
00:43:01.352 --> 00:43:02.622
to say is a dance, and no,

1247
00:43:02.623 --> 00:43:04.959
- I don't think this is the right
- time for that, Eugenia.


1248
00:43:04.962 --> 00:43:06.398
Nonsense! It's a perfect way

1249
00:43:06.399 --> 00:43:07.836
to let off some steam

1250
00:43:07.837 --> 00:43:09.527
through vigorous

1251
00:43:09.528 --> 00:43:11.215
rhythmic activity.

1252
00:43:11.216 --> 00:43:12.592
Yeah, actually, I think that

1253
00:43:12.593 --> 00:43:13.967
would be a really good way

1254
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:14.990
for everyone to just...

1255
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:16.011
get along again.

1256
00:43:17.077 --> 00:43:18.138
Really.

1257
00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:19.724
Do you think that's

1258
00:43:19.725 --> 00:43:21.308
possible, hm? Walton?

1259
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:23.685
Ms. Burton?

1260
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:25.813
Absolutely.

1261
00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:31.235
Come on! Rubber chicken,

1262
00:43:31.236 --> 00:43:33.529
Cayenne pepper, bird's nest...

1263
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.655
There is no way

1264
00:43:35.656 --> 00:43:37.012
that evil girl's not

1265
00:43:37.013 --> 00:43:38.367
planning something.

1266
00:43:38.368 --> 00:43:39.932
We have to be ready.

1267
00:43:39.933 --> 00:43:41.495
Bruno, we literally just agreed

1268
00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:42.935
to let bygones be bygones.

1269
00:43:42.936 --> 00:43:44.373
Which we'll do,

1270
00:43:44.374 --> 00:43:46.314
but if they start bygoning

1271
00:43:46.315 --> 00:43:48.252
again, we'll be ready.

1272
00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:50.088
Ah, there you are!

1273
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:51.922
Old Faithful.

1274
00:43:51.923 --> 00:43:53.883
- I've actually rigged it
- to a small battery


1275
00:43:53.886 --> 00:43:55.218
So it's way more buzzy. Hope

1276
00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:56.552
Diane doesn't have a pacemaker.

1277
00:43:56.553 --> 00:43:57.700
No!

1278
00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:58.845
Oh, come on!

1279
00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:01.182
- Dude, it doesn't hurt that bad.
- I do it to myself.


1280
00:44:01.185 --> 00:44:03.184
- Why do I get to have
- all of the fun, you know?


1281
00:44:03.187 --> 00:44:04.331
Bruno, I mean

1282
00:44:04.332 --> 00:44:05.477
no more pranks.

1283
00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:07.105
No more revenge.

1284
00:44:07.106 --> 00:44:08.730
It's over.

1285
00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:11.775
Wait, what's over? Like, us?

1286
00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.818
No, of course not!

1287
00:44:13.819 --> 00:44:15.425
Just... we can deal with

1288
00:44:15.426 --> 00:44:17.030
a little bit of change.

1289
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:18.116
It's only until

1290
00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:19.199
the end of the year.

1291
00:44:20.244 --> 00:44:21.285
Sorry, do you smell that?

1292
00:44:23.455 --> 00:44:26.039
Oh yeah, it's you.

1293
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.208
Stinking and sounding

1294
00:44:27.209 --> 00:44:28.375
like The Fish.

1295
00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:29.523
Dude, I don't know what's

1296
00:44:29.524 --> 00:44:30.668
happening to you anymore.

1297
00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:32.338
- Maybe I just
- don't want everybody


1298
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:33.922
To end up hating everybody.

1299
00:44:33.923 --> 00:44:35.112
Maybe I actually liked

1300
00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:36.300
living with those other guys,

1301
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:37.365
doing different stuff.

1302
00:44:37.366 --> 00:44:38.427
Since when?

1303
00:44:38.428 --> 00:44:39.804
You were the one who was all,

1304
00:44:39.805 --> 00:44:41.179
"I don't know what to do, Bruno.

1305
00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.890
- I don't want change.
- I don't want to room


1306
00:44:42.893 --> 00:44:44.433
With anybody else, Bruno!"

1307
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:45.664
Yeah, well, maybe I've

1308
00:44:45.665 --> 00:44:46.893
changed. You know what,

1309
00:44:46.894 --> 00:44:48.584
maybe The Fish was right.

1310
00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.273
Maybe we should be apart.

1311
00:44:55.529 --> 00:44:56.529
Oh wow!

1312
00:44:58.449 --> 00:45:00.365
Ah! Okay.

1313
00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:01.931
Oh, come now, William,

1314
00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.494
it's going to be fun!

1315
00:45:03.495 --> 00:45:05.267
Music, movement, mutual respect.

1316
00:45:05.268 --> 00:45:07.038
Eugenia,

1317
00:45:07.039 --> 00:45:08.687
in my not inconsiderable

1318
00:45:08.688 --> 00:45:10.334
experience, I have found

1319
00:45:10.335 --> 00:45:11.920
that forced gatherings

1320
00:45:11.921 --> 00:45:13.504
meant to create amity

1321
00:45:13.505 --> 00:45:14.965
usually do

1322
00:45:14.966 --> 00:45:16.423
the exact opposite.

1323
00:45:16.424 --> 00:45:18.050
Oh, you. What could

1324
00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:19.675
possibly go wrong?

1325
00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:20.824
What could go wrong?

1326
00:45:20.825 --> 00:45:21.970
Where shall I start?

1327
00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:23.160
It's like you're standing

1328
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:24.348
on the edge of a cliff

1329
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:25.725
and you can't help but take

1330
00:45:25.726 --> 00:45:27.100
the extra step.

1331
00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:29.082
And you're like a fussy man

1332
00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:31.062
in a suit who doesn't believe

1333
00:45:31.063 --> 00:45:32.523
that kids can

1334
00:45:32.524 --> 00:45:33.982
have fun at a dance.

1335
00:45:33.983 --> 00:45:35.902
You don't quite understand how

1336
00:45:35.903 --> 00:45:37.819
analogies work, do you, Eugenia?

1337
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.695
Analogies are like kids.

1338
00:45:39.696 --> 00:45:41.178
Sometimes you just have

1339
00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:42.659
to trust them.

1340
00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:49.498
Oh...

1341
00:45:49.499 --> 00:45:53.085
♪ I want you by my side ♪

1342
00:45:58.341 --> 00:46:00.716
You were saying?

1343
00:46:00.717 --> 00:46:02.554
Ooh, dolphin!

1344
00:46:04.347 --> 00:46:07.182
♪ I could barely hide ♪

1345
00:46:07.183 --> 00:46:08.497
♪ I will fall for you

1346
00:46:08.498 --> 00:46:09.809
That way ♪

1347
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.124
We could just go over there

1348
00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:12.437
and ask them to dance.

1349
00:46:12.438 --> 00:46:14.232
Or... just hear me out here, we

1350
00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:16.024
could stay right here, and not.

1351
00:46:16.025 --> 00:46:17.026
I like this plan.

1352
00:46:17.027 --> 00:46:18.027
It's workable

1353
00:46:18.028 --> 00:46:19.049
and it has a lower

1354
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.070
humiliation factor.

1355
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:21.927
OK, guys, what is the worst

1356
00:46:21.928 --> 00:46:23.782
thing that is gonna happen?

1357
00:46:27.662 --> 00:46:30.872
Okay, that's pretty bad.

1358
00:46:30.873 --> 00:46:32.146
You know if we don't even try,

1359
00:46:32.147 --> 00:46:33.417
Ms. Scrimmage will make us all

1360
00:46:33.418 --> 00:46:35.336
- do a sharing circle
- about it tomorrow.


1361
00:46:35.339 --> 00:46:36.463
Okay, I'd rather do

1362
00:46:36.464 --> 00:46:37.588
a hot yoga sharing circle

1363
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:38.611
in a parka

1364
00:46:38.612 --> 00:46:39.631
than let that guy

1365
00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:40.737
have even one chance

1366
00:46:40.738 --> 00:46:41.841
to laugh at us.

1367
00:46:41.842 --> 00:46:43.636
Cathy, do you think

1368
00:46:43.637 --> 00:46:45.429
you're maybe getting

1369
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.847
a little... obsessed?

1370
00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:49.808
- I don't know what
- you're talking about.


1371
00:46:59.985 --> 00:47:01.820
Cathy?

1372
00:47:03.822 --> 00:47:05.303
Alright, how much longer do we

1373
00:47:05.304 --> 00:47:06.782
have to force these children

1374
00:47:06.783 --> 00:47:08.202
- to endure this?
- Oh!


1375
00:47:08.205 --> 00:47:09.621
Hey, everybody!

1376
00:47:09.624 --> 00:47:12.372
Are you ready to dance?

1377
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:15.208
Get this outta here!

1378
00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:16.878
That's right, it's me,

1379
00:47:16.879 --> 00:47:18.545
TV's Kip Kipperson,

1380
00:47:18.546 --> 00:47:20.256
here to answer

1381
00:47:20.257 --> 00:47:21.965
that age-old question...

1382
00:47:21.966 --> 00:47:25.176
Boogie or Breakdown?

1383
00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:27.721
No, no, no, no!

1384
00:47:27.722 --> 00:47:28.785
I'm still picking cupcakes

1385
00:47:28.786 --> 00:47:29.847
out of my ears.

1386
00:47:29.848 --> 00:47:30.954
I don't know who's

1387
00:47:30.955 --> 00:47:32.058
responsible for this,

1388
00:47:32.059 --> 00:47:33.144
but it's just

1389
00:47:33.145 --> 00:47:34.228
what we need.

1390
00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:40.735
- I knew Walton would
- pull something.


1391
00:47:40.738 --> 00:47:42.529
This has Burton written

1392
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.322
all over it. In pen.

1393
00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:47.492
Now, I'm gonna ask

1394
00:47:47.493 --> 00:47:48.493
two participants

1395
00:47:48.494 --> 00:47:49.744
to come up here

1396
00:47:49.745 --> 00:47:50.994
into our dance-agon

1397
00:47:50.995 --> 00:47:52.100
and show us their

1398
00:47:52.101 --> 00:47:53.204
most groovetastic moves

1399
00:47:53.205 --> 00:47:54.706
while the rest of us

1400
00:47:54.707 --> 00:47:56.209
and the viewers online

1401
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.709
make the decision: Boogie

1402
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:01.254
or Breakdown?

1403
00:48:01.255 --> 00:48:02.652
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1404
00:48:02.653 --> 00:48:04.048
No, no, no, no!

1405
00:48:04.049 --> 00:48:05.426
Yes!

1406
00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:06.802
Awesome!

1407
00:48:06.803 --> 00:48:07.887
Now, what do you

1408
00:48:07.888 --> 00:48:08.970
crazy kids have to say

1409
00:48:08.971 --> 00:48:10.598
before you boogie

1410
00:48:10.599 --> 00:48:12.223
or breakdown?

1411
00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:14.351
Holy Mother!

1412
00:48:14.352 --> 00:48:15.833
I have nothing to do with

1413
00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:17.312
this, but I just wanna say

1414
00:48:17.313 --> 00:48:18.794
thank you to whoever it was.

1415
00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.273
Was it my girls?

1416
00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:21.463
No!

1417
00:48:21.464 --> 00:48:22.651
Let's just say

1418
00:48:22.652 --> 00:48:24.820
it was a fun-nonymous tipster

1419
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:26.072
who knew that this place

1420
00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:27.322
needed some funk in its trunk,

1421
00:48:27.323 --> 00:48:29.116
some swing in its sting,

1422
00:48:29.117 --> 00:48:30.908
some black in its blue.

1423
00:48:30.909 --> 00:48:31.952
Now you're just

1424
00:48:31.953 --> 00:48:32.994
talking nonsense.

1425
00:48:32.995 --> 00:48:35.122
Hey, doesn't matter, we've got

1426
00:48:35.123 --> 00:48:37.248
13 million YouTube followers!

1427
00:48:38.793 --> 00:48:40.420
A Macdonald Hall headmaster

1428
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:42.045
does not bust moves.

1429
00:48:42.046 --> 00:48:43.444
Get fly, bowtie!

1430
00:48:43.445 --> 00:48:44.840
William, loosen up!

1431
00:48:46.531 --> 00:48:48.218
Go Sturgeon!

1432
00:49:26.758 --> 00:49:27.988
This is a trap!

1433
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:29.217
I can smell it!

1434
00:49:29.218 --> 00:49:30.949
Hold on, girls!

1435
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:32.679
We didn't plan this!

1436
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:28.234
Ha-ha-ha!

1437
00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:31.404
Such hijinks, such wild abandon!

1438
00:50:31.405 --> 00:50:33.178
If only I could be

1439
00:50:33.179 --> 00:50:34.951
part of such fun.

1440
00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:42.834
Come on, Cathy!

1441
00:50:52.259 --> 00:50:53.573
What are you doing here?

1442
00:50:53.574 --> 00:50:54.886
I'm about to end this nightmare!

1443
00:50:54.887 --> 00:50:57.222
Not before I do!

1444
00:50:59.935 --> 00:51:01.434
Drop it, drop it!

1445
00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.403
Drop it!

1446
00:51:27.127 --> 00:51:28.880
Everybody, back!

1447
00:51:51.257 --> 00:51:53.028
Is everybody okay? Everybody?

1448
00:51:53.029 --> 00:51:55.154
Okay?

1449
00:52:05.374 --> 00:52:08.167
Hello, Sturgeon.

1450
00:52:08.168 --> 00:52:10.294
Hartley?

1451
00:52:10.295 --> 00:52:12.255
What are you doing here?

1452
00:52:12.256 --> 00:52:13.278
Oh, I think

1453
00:52:13.279 --> 00:52:14.298
the real question is:

1454
00:52:14.299 --> 00:52:16.300
what are you doing here?

1455
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:18.929
I'm headmaster of this school.

1456
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.014
Oh, really? And for how long?

1457
00:52:21.015 --> 00:52:22.683
I would think that after

1458
00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:24.350
a disastrous prank war,

1459
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:25.936
the last thing a responsible

1460
00:52:25.937 --> 00:52:27.520
headmaster would do

1461
00:52:27.521 --> 00:52:28.710
is hold a Boogie or Breakdown

1462
00:52:28.711 --> 00:52:29.898
competition

1463
00:52:29.899 --> 00:52:31.380
in front of 10 million

1464
00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:32.859
YouTube viewers!

1465
00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.028
Thirteen million.

1466
00:52:35.029 --> 00:52:36.947
Oh, God.

1467
00:52:36.948 --> 00:52:38.512
How would you even

1468
00:52:38.513 --> 00:52:40.075
know about...

1469
00:52:44.622 --> 00:52:46.186
Hello? Kip Kipperson, from

1470
00:52:46.187 --> 00:52:47.749
Boogie or Breakdown Productions?

1471
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.751
Great. I have an event

1472
00:52:49.752 --> 00:52:51.087
that I think you'd be

1473
00:52:51.088 --> 00:52:52.420
Kip-tastic for.

1474
00:52:54.339 --> 00:52:55.507
Diabolical laughter

1475
00:52:55.508 --> 00:52:56.674
in the halls.

1476
00:52:56.675 --> 00:52:57.676
Three demerits.

1477
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.226
I dig the use of "Kip-tastic",

1478
00:53:07.227 --> 00:53:08.562
but you used dance

1479
00:53:08.563 --> 00:53:09.896
for evil, man,

1480
00:53:09.897 --> 00:53:11.522
and that is not cool with Kip.

1481
00:53:11.523 --> 00:53:13.067
Eh.

1482
00:53:18.154 --> 00:53:20.615
I just don't understand

1483
00:53:20.616 --> 00:53:22.013
how you thought this was

1484
00:53:22.014 --> 00:53:23.409
a good idea, Sturgeon.

1485
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:24.891
You know, it wasn't

1486
00:53:24.892 --> 00:53:26.370
exactly my idea,

1487
00:53:26.371 --> 00:53:28.081
Superintendent Snow.

1488
00:53:28.082 --> 00:53:29.312
And that's the problem.

1489
00:53:29.313 --> 00:53:30.541
You've lost control.

1490
00:53:30.542 --> 00:53:32.211
Hosting the Scrimmage girls

1491
00:53:32.212 --> 00:53:33.878
is one thing, but a prank war?

1492
00:53:33.879 --> 00:53:36.631
An internet dance fiasco?

1493
00:53:36.632 --> 00:53:37.842
And reports

1494
00:53:37.843 --> 00:53:39.050
you were seen doing...

1495
00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:41.052
the stanky leg?

1496
00:53:42.805 --> 00:53:43.827
Hello, this is Eugenia

1497
00:53:43.828 --> 00:53:44.848
Scrimmage and I think

1498
00:53:44.849 --> 00:53:45.913
I can help.

1499
00:53:45.914 --> 00:53:46.975
Oh, please don't.

1500
00:53:46.976 --> 00:53:48.227
We have had some interesting

1501
00:53:48.228 --> 00:53:49.477
transition challenges,

1502
00:53:49.478 --> 00:53:50.896
it's nothing that a sharing

1503
00:53:50.897 --> 00:53:52.313
circle couldn't sort out.

1504
00:53:52.314 --> 00:53:53.857
Ms. Scrimmage, the Governing

1505
00:53:53.858 --> 00:53:55.399
Board of Governance and I

1506
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.464
couldn't agree more.

1507
00:53:56.465 --> 00:53:57.527
In fact, we are prepared

1508
00:53:57.528 --> 00:53:58.862
to have our own sharing

1509
00:53:58.863 --> 00:54:00.195
circle when we discuss

1510
00:54:00.196 --> 00:54:01.782
who will run the Hall before

1511
00:54:01.783 --> 00:54:03.367
someone gets seriously hurt.

1512
00:54:05.036 --> 00:54:06.391
Surely you don't mean...

1513
00:54:06.392 --> 00:54:07.745
firing me?

1514
00:54:07.746 --> 00:54:08.976
That is one option

1515
00:54:08.977 --> 00:54:10.205
on the table.

1516
00:54:10.206 --> 00:54:11.750
We do have a very qualified

1517
00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:13.292
replacement

1518
00:54:13.293 --> 00:54:15.191
who is willing and able to...

1519
00:54:15.192 --> 00:54:17.088
No. No, please, don't say...

1520
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:18.653
Hello, Sturgeon.

1521
00:54:18.654 --> 00:54:20.215
Hartley.

1522
00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:21.677
It's me, Rob Hartley.

1523
00:54:21.678 --> 00:54:23.136
Yeah, I just said that.

1524
00:54:23.137 --> 00:54:24.284
Oh.

1525
00:54:24.285 --> 00:54:25.429
Mr. Hartley

1526
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.328
has some very interesting ideas

1527
00:54:27.329 --> 00:54:29.224
about how better to serve

1528
00:54:29.225 --> 00:54:31.436
- the students of Macdonald Hall.
- Mm-hmm.


1529
00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:32.500
Oh, I'm sure he's very

1530
00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:33.563
interested in my job,

1531
00:54:33.564 --> 00:54:34.772
since he just lost his own.

1532
00:54:34.773 --> 00:54:36.317
Well, you see,

1533
00:54:36.318 --> 00:54:37.859
let me explain that.

1534
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.883
Like many great men before me,

1535
00:54:39.884 --> 00:54:41.905
I was duped... duped, I say...

1536
00:54:41.906 --> 00:54:43.948
By cougar traffickers,

1537
00:54:43.949 --> 00:54:45.221
but all charges were

1538
00:54:45.222 --> 00:54:46.492
dropped, Sturgeon,

1539
00:54:46.493 --> 00:54:47.766
when I agreed to testify

1540
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:49.037
against everyone,

1541
00:54:49.038 --> 00:54:50.956
- including people
- I've never met before.


1542
00:54:50.959 --> 00:54:52.729
So all's well that ends well.

1543
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:54.500
We can discuss

1544
00:54:54.501 --> 00:54:56.378
all of this, including just who

1545
00:54:56.379 --> 00:54:58.253
is best suited to run the Hall,

1546
00:54:58.254 --> 00:55:00.464
when the Board meets at the Hall

1547
00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:02.466
tomorrow. Hartley?

1548
00:55:02.467 --> 00:55:03.948
Mm-hmm. I wouldn't

1549
00:55:03.949 --> 00:55:05.428
miss it for the world.

1550
00:55:08.057 --> 00:55:09.350
Your evil is

1551
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:10.641
showing, Hartley.

1552
00:55:10.642 --> 00:55:13.144
Oh. Thought I'd hung up.

1553
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.065
Still on, Hartley.

1554
00:55:17.066 --> 00:55:18.649
Oh.

1555
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.694
Tomorrow, Sturgeon.

1556
00:55:22.571 --> 00:55:23.718
We will support you,

1557
00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:24.864
William, don't worry.

1558
00:55:24.865 --> 00:55:26.158
My girls, myself,

1559
00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:27.450
my entire school...

1560
00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:29.452
We will all be behind you.

1561
00:55:29.453 --> 00:55:31.829
Eugenia,

1562
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.206
I'm right over here.

1563
00:55:38.462 --> 00:55:40.089
William,

1564
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.714
are you alright?

1565
00:55:41.715 --> 00:55:43.363
I told my boys

1566
00:55:43.364 --> 00:55:45.009
that change was good,

1567
00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.511
- that it was a necessary
- part of life


1568
00:55:46.514 --> 00:55:48.304
- And they could
- deal with it and...


1569
00:55:48.307 --> 00:55:49.681
And you were right.

1570
00:55:49.682 --> 00:55:51.057
No, I was wrong!

1571
00:55:51.058 --> 00:55:53.726
I was very wrong.

1572
00:55:53.727 --> 00:55:56.146
Now I have to fix it.

1573
00:55:56.147 --> 00:55:58.816
Somehow.

1574
00:56:06.031 --> 00:56:07.825
Where did you

1575
00:56:07.826 --> 00:56:09.617
learn those moves?

1576
00:56:09.618 --> 00:56:12.203
Don't you wanna see, Cathy?

1577
00:56:12.204 --> 00:56:14.122
Everyone's having a blast.

1578
00:56:14.123 --> 00:56:15.958
Okay, where you see a blast,

1579
00:56:15.959 --> 00:56:17.792
I see another Bruno Walton plot.

1580
00:56:17.793 --> 00:56:18.982
Yeah, well,

1581
00:56:18.983 --> 00:56:20.170
we sure see something.

1582
00:56:20.171 --> 00:56:22.130
Girls, we need to talk.

1583
00:56:22.131 --> 00:56:23.798
I'll get the sharing stick.

1584
00:56:23.799 --> 00:56:24.800
I'd like to propose

1585
00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:25.801
another study session:

1586
00:56:25.802 --> 00:56:26.990
revenge and its practical

1587
00:56:26.991 --> 00:56:28.178
applications.

1588
00:56:28.179 --> 00:56:29.347
Diane, forget the stick.

1589
00:56:29.348 --> 00:56:30.513
And I'm not here to talk

1590
00:56:30.514 --> 00:56:32.474
- about a study session.
- I'm here to say that,


1591
00:56:32.477 --> 00:56:33.663
For the first time

1592
00:56:33.664 --> 00:56:34.851
in my life as an educator

1593
00:56:34.852 --> 00:56:36.437
and an awakening

1594
00:56:36.438 --> 00:56:38.021
specialist, that I am...

1595
00:56:38.022 --> 00:56:40.065
disappointed.

1596
00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:43.235
In who?

1597
00:56:43.236 --> 00:56:44.610
Yeah, tell us

1598
00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:46.301
and they're done.

1599
00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:47.989
In you girls and your behavior.

1600
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:50.407
But I...

1601
00:56:50.408 --> 00:56:52.451
I don't understand.

1602
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:54.330
Is this what

1603
00:56:54.331 --> 00:56:56.206
they call... criticism?

1604
00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:57.833
Yes, it is, and I think

1605
00:56:57.834 --> 00:56:59.458
you all need some.

1606
00:56:59.459 --> 00:57:01.023
Mr. Sturgeon opened up

1607
00:57:01.024 --> 00:57:02.586
his hall to us

1608
00:57:02.587 --> 00:57:04.005
in our time of need,

1609
00:57:04.006 --> 00:57:05.422
and how have we repaid him?

1610
00:57:05.423 --> 00:57:07.591
Through prank wars

1611
00:57:07.592 --> 00:57:09.552
and dance disasters

1612
00:57:09.553 --> 00:57:10.805
and horrible manners!

1613
00:57:10.806 --> 00:57:12.055
Manners?

1614
00:57:12.056 --> 00:57:13.620
What is this supposed to be, a

1615
00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:15.183
young ladies' finishing school?

1616
00:57:15.184 --> 00:57:16.227
I thought you wanted

1617
00:57:16.228 --> 00:57:17.268
strong, independent women

1618
00:57:17.269 --> 00:57:18.937
that take...

1619
00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:20.604
I do Strong independent women

1620
00:57:20.605 --> 00:57:22.086
know how to treat their friends,

1621
00:57:22.087 --> 00:57:23.566
which is apparently something

1622
00:57:23.567 --> 00:57:26.194
you don't know how to do.

1623
00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:37.278
- Oh, nice try, but I'm still
- not talking to you, dude.


1624
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:39.582
- Yeah, well, I didn't ask
- for this meeting, you did.


1625
00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:40.939
Wrong again, Melvin.

1626
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.293
Yeah, that's right,

1627
00:57:42.294 --> 00:57:44.588
- I'm so mad at you I'm not even
- using your cool nickname,


1628
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:46.382
- Which I gave you.
- Wait.


1629
00:57:46.385 --> 00:57:47.696
If I didn't set this up

1630
00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.008
and you didn't set this up,

1631
00:57:49.009 --> 00:57:50.281
then who set this up?

1632
00:57:50.282 --> 00:57:51.552
We did.

1633
00:57:51.553 --> 00:57:53.159
We need to talk,

1634
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.764
all of us.

1635
00:57:54.765 --> 00:57:56.392
- I'd rather eat dirt
- than talk to her.


1636
00:57:56.395 --> 00:57:58.352
- Oh, I can arrange that.
- Stop!


1637
00:57:58.355 --> 00:57:59.875
Guys, Sturgeon might get fired

1638
00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.396
because we can't get along.

1639
00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:03.315
- Fired?
- What do you mean?


1640
00:58:03.318 --> 00:58:04.775
How do you know?

1641
00:58:07.403 --> 00:58:08.529
When Scrimmage came

1642
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.653
and gave us a lecture...

1643
00:58:09.654 --> 00:58:11.177
Wait, wait.

1644
00:58:11.178 --> 00:58:12.698
Scrimmage lectured you?

1645
00:58:12.699 --> 00:58:15.076
Yeah, pretty freaky.

1646
00:58:15.077 --> 00:58:16.099
So we checked around,

1647
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.120
talked to some

1648
00:58:17.121 --> 00:58:18.289
of our resources... we can't

1649
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:19.455
really tell you who,

1650
00:58:19.456 --> 00:58:20.833
it's hush-hush, but...

1651
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:22.208
We asked Mrs. Davis.

1652
00:58:22.209 --> 00:58:23.565
The Board's meeting tomorrow

1653
00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:24.919
to decide if Sturgeon goes

1654
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.255
and Hartley

1655
00:58:26.256 --> 00:58:27.588
takes his place.

1656
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:29.341
Whoa, The Fish can be a real

1657
00:58:29.342 --> 00:58:31.092
pain in the pants sometimes...

1658
00:58:31.093 --> 00:58:32.553
Yeah, but no way the Hall

1659
00:58:32.554 --> 00:58:34.012
would deserve Hartley.

1660
00:58:35.555 --> 00:58:36.702
This is all our fault.

1661
00:58:36.703 --> 00:58:37.848
No,

1662
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:39.205
I'd say it's 30% us,

1663
00:58:39.206 --> 00:58:40.559
70% the Scrimmage girls.

1664
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.874
Oh my...

1665
00:58:41.875 --> 00:58:43.187
But who's counting, right?

1666
00:58:43.188 --> 00:58:44.690
Well, 100% of us

1667
00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:46.191
need to do something.

1668
00:58:47.776 --> 00:58:49.049
She's right. Thankfully,

1669
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:50.320
I have a plan.

1670
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:51.468
Bruno!

1671
00:58:51.469 --> 00:58:52.613
It's risky, you know,

1672
00:58:52.614 --> 00:58:54.012
and may involve military

1673
00:58:54.013 --> 00:58:55.408
vehicles and a lot of penguins...

1674
00:58:55.409 --> 00:58:58.202
We do nothing.

1675
00:58:58.203 --> 00:58:59.726
Boots, if we don't

1676
00:58:59.727 --> 00:59:01.247
do anything,

1677
00:59:01.248 --> 00:59:02.665
Sturgeon could get fired

1678
00:59:02.666 --> 00:59:04.626
- and Hartley would be - running the Hall.
- No.


1679
00:59:04.629 --> 00:59:06.252
He's right.

1680
00:59:06.253 --> 00:59:07.713
Everything we've been doing,

1681
00:59:07.714 --> 00:59:09.172
it all has to stop.

1682
00:59:09.173 --> 00:59:10.361
But when Sturgeon

1683
00:59:10.362 --> 00:59:11.548
is having that meeting,

1684
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:12.613
the Hall needs to be

1685
00:59:12.614 --> 00:59:13.676
the quietest,

1686
00:59:13.677 --> 00:59:14.970
best school

1687
00:59:14.971 --> 00:59:16.262
in the country.

1688
00:59:18.245 --> 00:59:20.224
So no pranks and no revenge.

1689
00:59:20.225 --> 00:59:22.059
Okay.

1690
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.687
- Just to be clear,
- I'm still mad at you.


1691
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.355
Yeah, me too.

1692
00:59:25.356 --> 00:59:26.858
We still have to tell the boys.

1693
00:59:26.859 --> 00:59:28.358
And I'll tell the girls.

1694
00:59:28.359 --> 00:59:29.568
For one day in

1695
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:30.776
the Hall's history,

1696
00:59:30.777 --> 00:59:32.903
no surprises.

1697
00:59:35.366 --> 00:59:37.409
You gotta be kidding me!

1698
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:44.791
A hot air balloon?

1699
00:59:51.173 --> 00:59:53.008
It is I, crown prince

1700
00:59:53.009 --> 00:59:54.842
of Malbonia, Francisco Diaz.

1701
00:59:54.843 --> 00:59:56.762
I ran away to come here

1702
00:59:56.763 --> 00:59:58.679
to be a Macdonald Hall boy

1703
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.849
like you said I should, Bruno.

1704
01:00:03.977 --> 01:00:05.354
So, where's all

1705
01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:06.729
the fun to be had?

1706
01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.814
You were right.

1707
01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:10.859
It does taste like stardust.

1708
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.902
So funny!

1709
01:00:14.593 --> 01:00:16.280
What's the problem, Smith?

1710
01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:17.387
George isn't a big fan

1711
01:00:17.388 --> 01:00:18.491
of the homeless.

1712
01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:19.535
I mean, where

1713
01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:20.576
do they even live?

1714
01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:22.600
But that's not what my look

1715
01:00:22.601 --> 01:00:24.621
of horror is about, O'Neal.

1716
01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:25.978
Am I the only one here who

1717
01:00:25.979 --> 01:00:27.334
follows international news?

1718
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:30.921
Of course I am.

1719
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.424
People of Malbonia,

1720
01:00:34.425 --> 01:00:35.676
something terrible

1721
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.926
has happened.

1722
01:00:36.927 --> 01:00:38.802
Late last night,

1723
01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:39.888
our beloved prince regent

1724
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:40.971
Francisco

1725
01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:42.036
was taken

1726
01:00:42.037 --> 01:00:43.099
from Castle Malbonia

1727
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.976
by some unscrupulous monsters

1728
01:00:45.977 --> 01:00:48.251
who left a note with

1729
01:00:48.252 --> 01:00:50.523
only one word: Canada.

1730
01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:52.213
Franny, did you

1731
01:00:52.214 --> 01:00:53.901
write that note?

1732
01:00:53.902 --> 01:00:55.652
The Prime Minister

1733
01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:57.572
of this strange and exotic land

1734
01:00:57.573 --> 01:00:59.490
has agreed to help us.

1735
01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:01.951
Rest assured, my people,

1736
01:01:01.952 --> 01:01:03.474
when we find out

1737
01:01:03.475 --> 01:01:04.995
where Francisco is,

1738
01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:06.310
there will be terrible

1739
01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:07.623
consequences.

1740
01:01:07.624 --> 01:01:08.874
Awesome.

1741
01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.169
Remember Malbonia's

1742
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.461
royal motto:

1743
01:01:11.462 --> 01:01:14.048
Never forget. Never forgive.

1744
01:01:14.049 --> 01:01:16.632
Never forget, never forgive.

1745
01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:19.635
Okay.

1746
01:01:19.636 --> 01:01:21.325
Wait, you ran away!

1747
01:01:21.326 --> 01:01:23.013
This isn't our fault!

1748
01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:24.640
This is a fair point.

1749
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.976
- We just need to take him
- to the Malbonia Embassy


1750
01:01:26.977 --> 01:01:28.166
and explain what happened.

1751
01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:29.353
No!

1752
01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:31.355
I came here to have fun.

1753
01:01:31.356 --> 01:01:33.816
Malbonia is so boring.

1754
01:01:33.817 --> 01:01:35.465
I wanna be a Hall boy.

1755
01:01:35.466 --> 01:01:37.111
I can live right here.

1756
01:01:37.112 --> 01:01:38.280
Uh, no, no, no, no, no,

1757
01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:39.447
absolutely not.

1758
01:01:39.448 --> 01:01:40.824
There's already a waiting list

1759
01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:42.199
to be one of my interns. He...

1760
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.556
Francisco, when you become king,

1761
01:01:43.557 --> 01:01:44.910
you're gonna be able

1762
01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:46.329
to do whatever you want.

1763
01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:47.746
But I already know

1764
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.853
what I want! I wanna stay

1765
01:01:48.854 --> 01:01:49.957
here, be a Hall boy,

1766
01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51.293
and make hijinks with Bruno

1767
01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:52.627
and Boots forever.

1768
01:01:52.628 --> 01:01:54.296
But Franny, we're not

1769
01:01:54.297 --> 01:01:55.963
gonna stay here forever,

1770
01:01:55.964 --> 01:01:57.466
'cause at some point,

1771
01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:58.967
everything's gonna change.

1772
01:02:03.013 --> 01:02:04.931
Whether we like it or not.

1773
01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:11.021
We have to fix this

1774
01:02:11.022 --> 01:02:12.938
before the Hall becomes

1775
01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:13.982
the middle of

1776
01:02:13.983 --> 01:02:15.024
an international incident

1777
01:02:15.025 --> 01:02:16.733
and The Fish gets blamed!

1778
01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.132
But even if you do,

1779
01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:19.529
to save Sturgeon, you need

1780
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.990
to convince the Board and unless

1781
01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:22.448
one of you is a member, which...

1782
01:02:22.449 --> 01:02:23.679
Well, I do have

1783
01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.908
an aunt and uncle on it.

1784
01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:26.077
So they can come and talk

1785
01:02:26.078 --> 01:02:27.244
to the Board tomorrow!

1786
01:02:28.539 --> 01:02:29.830
No, no, no, no, no,

1787
01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:30.916
there's no time!

1788
01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:31.999
They live in Singapore!

1789
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.397
They haven't been back to

1790
01:02:33.398 --> 01:02:34.793
the Hall in over 20 years.

1791
01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:35.900
There may have been

1792
01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:37.004
some legal issues.

1793
01:02:37.005 --> 01:02:38.131
Of course there were.

1794
01:02:38.132 --> 01:02:39.256
You know how it is...

1795
01:02:39.257 --> 01:02:41.218
- You run one billion-dollar
- Ponzi scheme,


1796
01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:43.116
Suddenly you're the bad guy.

1797
01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:45.012
Cathy...

1798
01:02:45.013 --> 01:02:47.014
I know that look.

1799
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:49.600
So do I. Bruno...

1800
01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:50.623
you have a crazy plan,

1801
01:02:50.624 --> 01:02:51.644
don't you?

1802
01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:53.251
Feel like dressing up as a

1803
01:02:53.252 --> 01:02:54.855
certain aunt and uncle, Burton?

1804
01:02:54.856 --> 01:02:56.462
Maybe, Walton. You feel like

1805
01:02:56.463 --> 01:02:58.067
making an impassioned case

1806
01:02:58.068 --> 01:02:59.695
to the Board, convincing them

1807
01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:01.320
that The Fish must stay?

1808
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:02.635
That is the craziest thing

1809
01:03:02.636 --> 01:03:03.947
I have ever heard

1810
01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:05.200
and there is no way it is gonna

1811
01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:06.450
work the way you think it is.

1812
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:07.765
Of course not.

1813
01:03:07.766 --> 01:03:09.078
But whatever does happen,

1814
01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:10.414
Burton and I will

1815
01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:11.747
figure it out. Together.

1816
01:03:17.754 --> 01:03:19.256
Come on, George.

1817
01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:20.757
Didn't wanna touch you.

1818
01:03:21.675 --> 01:03:24.301
For the muffins!

1819
01:03:24.302 --> 01:03:26.637
I mean... for the Hall!

1820
01:03:26.638 --> 01:03:29.099
You're absolutely right, Franny.

1821
01:03:29.102 --> 01:03:30.225
- Break!
- Yes!


1822
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:37.671
Peaceful and quiet.

1823
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.652
As long as that lasts.

1824
01:03:41.653 --> 01:03:43.405
William, I'm sure everything

1825
01:03:43.406 --> 01:03:45.155
is going to be fine.

1826
01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:46.721
Really, Eugenia?

1827
01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.284
What exactly in the past month

1828
01:03:48.285 --> 01:03:50.099
has given you confidence

1829
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.912
to say that? Hm?

1830
01:03:51.913 --> 01:03:54.831
Ms. Davis,

1831
01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:57.834
bring me... the speech.

1832
01:03:59.276 --> 01:04:00.713
Are you sure, Mr. Sturgeon?

1833
01:04:00.714 --> 01:04:02.798
Absolutely.

1834
01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:05.217
What is the speech?

1835
01:04:19.149 --> 01:04:20.900
Ready?

1836
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.737
- Three,
- One,


1837
01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.967
Two, one.

1838
01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:26.197
Two, three.

1839
01:04:31.828 --> 01:04:33.559
What is that?

1840
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.289
This...

1841
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:36.833
is the speech that

1842
01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:38.375
Willy gave to the Board

1843
01:04:38.376 --> 01:04:39.836
when he first interviewed

1844
01:04:39.837 --> 01:04:41.295
for the job, and they said

1845
01:04:41.296 --> 01:04:43.131
it was the best speech they'd

1846
01:04:43.132 --> 01:04:44.965
ever heard about Macdonald Hall

1847
01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:47.134
that didn't rhyme.

1848
01:04:47.135 --> 01:04:48.762
And sometimes, on a clear night,

1849
01:04:48.763 --> 01:04:50.387
you can still hear the words

1850
01:04:50.388 --> 01:04:52.723
echoing down the halls.

1851
01:04:52.724 --> 01:04:55.058
And by Mackenzie's beard,

1852
01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.060
these words shall echo again.

1853
01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.250
William, I'm sure

1854
01:04:58.251 --> 01:04:59.438
it's a very nice speech,

1855
01:04:59.439 --> 01:05:01.129
but haven't you changed a lot

1856
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.817
since you first started? Grown?

1857
01:05:02.818 --> 01:05:04.236
Blossomed, even? 
Don't you think

1858
01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:05.653
you should talk about that?

1859
01:05:05.654 --> 01:05:06.863
Don't touch it!

1860
01:05:06.864 --> 01:05:08.071
Oh!

1861
01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:09.136
Eugenia, I think

1862
01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:10.199
I've done enough change.

1863
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.222
It's time to go

1864
01:05:11.223 --> 01:05:12.242
with what works.

1865
01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:13.745
Tradition.

1866
01:05:13.746 --> 01:05:15.245
History.

1867
01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:19.249
"To my fellow educators.

1868
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:21.918
"A full education means

1869
01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:24.129
an ethical education."

1870
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.131
And of course tradition,

1871
01:05:26.132 --> 01:05:27.300
the very foundation on which

1872
01:05:27.301 --> 01:05:28.467
Macdonald Hall is built...

1873
01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:29.490
Nice words, Sturgeon,

1874
01:05:29.491 --> 01:05:30.511
but you can save it

1875
01:05:30.512 --> 01:05:31.846
for when we get inside.

1876
01:05:31.847 --> 01:05:32.889
Oh, don't be too hard

1877
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:33.930
on him, Ms. Snow.

1878
01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.120
I'm sure

1879
01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:36.308
Headmaster Sturgeon

1880
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:38.186
- will do everything
- he can to keep his job.


1881
01:05:38.189 --> 01:05:39.917
Not everything, Hartley.

1882
01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:41.647
Just the right thing.

1883
01:05:41.648 --> 01:05:43.400
We'll see about

1884
01:05:43.401 --> 01:05:45.151
that, won't we?

1885
01:05:48.363 --> 01:05:49.614
Fish.

1886
01:05:51.783 --> 01:05:53.431
Yes, I went there.

1887
01:05:55.078 --> 01:05:56.705
Snow?

1888
01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:01.834
Please.

1889
01:06:01.835 --> 01:06:03.128
I can't believe it!

1890
01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:04.420
I, Francisco Diaz,

1891
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:05.443
crown prince of Malbonia,

1892
01:06:05.444 --> 01:06:06.463
involved

1893
01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:07.486
in a legendary

1894
01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:08.507
Macdonald Hall caper.

1895
01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:10.467
That's pretty exciting.

1896
01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.178
- If you guys don't stop
- distracting me,


1897
01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:14.180
It'll be pretty over soon.

1898
01:06:27.048 --> 01:06:28.068
So long as Diane's drone

1899
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:30.196
- can get the keys, we should be
- able to drive the prince


1900
01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:31.406
Out of here before the board

1901
01:06:31.407 --> 01:06:32.615
meeting is even finished.

1902
01:06:32.616 --> 01:06:33.867
And since I'm driving,

1903
01:06:33.868 --> 01:06:35.117
you know what that means.

1904
01:06:35.118 --> 01:06:37.350
We can test vehicular velocity

1905
01:06:37.351 --> 01:06:39.580
as it relates to wind drag?

1906
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:41.749
No, man! Drive-thru!

1907
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:44.167
I envy you, Wilbur.

1908
01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:45.586
For your simple pleasures.

1909
01:06:45.587 --> 01:06:46.630
There is nothing simple

1910
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:47.671
about this.

1911
01:06:47.672 --> 01:06:49.800
- We have about an hour to hit up
- ten places between here


1912
01:06:49.803 --> 01:06:51.114
And the embassy. We'll need

1913
01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:52.426
some serious coordination.

1914
01:06:52.427 --> 01:06:53.762
Whereas I chose my life's

1915
01:06:53.763 --> 01:06:55.095
passion: science.

1916
01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:57.055
Yes, she has betrayed me.

1917
01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.057
Everybody else's

1918
01:06:58.058 --> 01:06:59.058
prank worked,

1919
01:06:59.059 --> 01:07:02.519
but my Viscositizer... nothing!

1920
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.543
The irony, it stings...

1921
01:07:04.544 --> 01:07:06.565
like iron.

1922
01:07:06.566 --> 01:07:09.192
Uh-huh.

1923
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.445
So, about that drive-thru?

1924
01:07:11.446 --> 01:07:13.489
Chris, we gotta move.

1925
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:15.658
Time to do your magic.

1926
01:07:15.659 --> 01:07:17.161
I'm assuming this

1927
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:18.661
is all unionized?

1928
01:07:29.756 --> 01:07:30.945
Why is he smiling

1929
01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.132
like that, Walton?

1930
01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:33.364
We're usually the ones

1931
01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:34.593
with the big crazy smiles.

1932
01:07:34.594 --> 01:07:35.886
Yeah, I know.

1933
01:07:35.887 --> 01:07:37.639
- It's kind of weird
- to look at.


1934
01:07:37.642 --> 01:07:39.975
Chris, what are you thinking?

1935
01:07:44.145 --> 01:07:46.105
And of course, what would a

1936
01:07:46.106 --> 01:07:48.064
Macdonald Hall board meeting be

1937
01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.233
without my renowned

1938
01:07:49.234 --> 01:07:50.400
tea biscuits?

1939
01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:52.528
Ms. Snow?

1940
01:07:52.529 --> 01:07:53.551
Why don't you take two?

1941
01:07:53.552 --> 01:07:54.571
Nobody's looking.

1942
01:07:56.533 --> 01:07:58.450
Looks like Mr. 
Sturgeon forgot

1943
01:07:58.451 --> 01:07:59.765
about your extreme gluten

1944
01:07:59.766 --> 01:08:01.077
allergy, Ms. Snow.

1945
01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:02.246
Carrot stick?

1946
01:08:02.247 --> 01:08:03.414
Thank you.

1947
01:08:11.006 --> 01:08:13.340
Stress eating again, Sturgeon?

1948
01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.759
Alright, alright.

1949
01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.220
Let's get this show on the road.

1950
01:08:17.221 --> 01:08:18.679
Wait!

1951
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.411
Don't start without us!

1952
01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:22.140
We are on the board, too.

1953
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:23.414
Hello, everyone!

1954
01:08:23.415 --> 01:08:24.685
Charlie Wexford,

1955
01:08:24.686 --> 01:08:25.937
and this is my beautiful wife

1956
01:08:25.938 --> 01:08:27.187
Brunhilda.

1957
01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:28.690
- Sorry to be late.
- Hello.


1958
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:34.904
- Yes, sorry
- to be late, yes.


1959
01:08:34.905 --> 01:08:36.594
I'm sure if I was allowed to go

1960
01:08:36.595 --> 01:08:38.281
to the Hall, Mr. Sturgeon

1961
01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:39.325
would've taught me

1962
01:08:39.326 --> 01:08:40.367
about arriving on time.

1963
01:08:40.368 --> 01:08:42.369
And freshly baked goods!

1964
01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:44.287
This takes leadership, you know.

1965
01:08:44.288 --> 01:08:45.498
Well, speaking

1966
01:08:45.499 --> 01:08:46.707
about leadership,

1967
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.938
let's discuss it, shall we?

1968
01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:49.167
Ah!

1969
01:08:49.168 --> 01:08:50.545
Fantastic idea!

1970
01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:51.922
Let's.

1971
01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:08.563
What is that horrible noise?

1972
01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.108
The keys!

1973
01:09:13.818 --> 01:09:14.903
You did it!

1974
01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:15.986
Was there ever any doubt?

1975
01:09:15.987 --> 01:09:18.114
- Not in you.
- Alright, now let's get everyone


1976
01:09:18.117 --> 01:09:19.950
- Back to the parking lot,
- and Wilbur and Elmer


1977
01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:21.618
- Can drive this kid
- back to his embassy.


1978
01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:23.119
- But I've barely
- had any adventure!


1979
01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:24.328
It's not over yet, Franny.

1980
01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.876
- The Viscositizer had three
- main elements


1981
01:09:29.879 --> 01:09:31.544
- Meant to work
- in perfect harmony:


1982
01:09:31.547 --> 01:09:33.213
Mechanical, chemical, and

1983
01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:34.880
what I like to call awesome.

1984
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:36.841
It...

1985
01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.074
Why does it feel like

1986
01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.386
I'm at the dentist?

1987
01:09:41.387 --> 01:09:44.598
Get it? Laughing gas!

1988
01:09:44.599 --> 01:09:46.892
Why can't I work?

1989
01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:55.715
They're fine.

1990
01:09:55.716 --> 01:09:57.319
Just sleeping.

1991
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.030
- What is this place?
- Some kind


1992
01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:00.114
Of infernal Canadian

1993
01:10:00.115 --> 01:10:01.197
kidnapping academy?

1994
01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:02.429
Once we have

1995
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.659
what we came for,

1996
01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:05.516
we will free all the children.

1997
01:10:05.517 --> 01:10:07.370
For Malbonia!

1998
01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:15.401
And now, I think

1999
01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:17.089
the Board is ready

2000
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:18.696
to hear statements

2001
01:10:18.697 --> 01:10:20.300
from headmaster Sturgeon,

2002
01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:22.219
- followed
- by Mr. Hartley,


2003
01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:24.055
- On what they
- think is best


2004
01:10:24.058 --> 01:10:26.890
For Macdonald Hall.

2005
01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:28.810
Sturgeon!

2006
01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:36.775
Ladies and gentlemen...

2007
01:10:36.776 --> 01:10:39.049
Honor and tradition...

2008
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:41.322
are the, uh...

2009
01:10:42.657 --> 01:10:43.867
Oh, no.

2010
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.785
Are the, uh...

2011
01:10:46.786 --> 01:10:49.412
Excuse me

2012
01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:51.040
just one moment, please,

2013
01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:52.666
if you could. I, uh...

2014
01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.877
Well, if Mr. Sturgeonpants

2015
01:10:54.878 --> 01:10:56.796
- doesn't seem to be ready
- for this meeting


2016
01:10:56.799 --> 01:10:58.256
which he's known about since

2017
01:10:58.257 --> 01:10:59.715
yesterday, but who's counting?

2018
01:10:59.716 --> 01:11:01.885
Perhaps I could go first.

2019
01:11:03.887 --> 01:11:05.013
Yes, please do.

2020
01:11:05.014 --> 01:11:06.139
Ah!

2021
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:18.108
We'll see about that, won't we?

2022
01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:19.903
Fish.

2023
01:11:26.201 --> 01:11:27.868
What does this Hall

2024
01:11:27.869 --> 01:11:29.558
deserve? Well,

2025
01:11:29.559 --> 01:11:31.246
unlike my friend here,

2026
01:11:31.247 --> 01:11:32.957
I can think of a few words

2027
01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:34.666
right off the top of my head.

2028
01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:36.211
Words like "tradition"

2029
01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:37.753
and "honor".

2030
01:11:37.754 --> 01:11:39.005
I just finished saying

2031
01:11:39.006 --> 01:11:40.255
those exact words.

2032
01:11:40.256 --> 01:11:43.508
Let the man speak, Sturgeon.

2033
01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:45.220
Thank you, Ms. Snow.

2034
01:11:50.141 --> 01:11:51.392
What's going on?

2035
01:11:51.393 --> 01:11:52.642
My initial findings

2036
01:11:52.643 --> 01:11:53.874
would suggest some sort

2037
01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:55.105
of sleeping gas.

2038
01:11:59.817 --> 01:12:01.902
Just before I passed out,

2039
01:12:01.903 --> 01:12:03.154
I think I remember

2040
01:12:03.155 --> 01:12:04.404
some soldiers.

2041
01:12:04.405 --> 01:12:05.761
They were all wearing these

2042
01:12:05.762 --> 01:12:07.116
funny black slippers.

2043
01:12:07.117 --> 01:12:08.848
Soldiers?

2044
01:12:08.849 --> 01:12:10.577
Black funny slippers... ninjas?

2045
01:12:10.578 --> 01:12:12.268
Cool!

2046
01:12:12.269 --> 01:12:13.956
The Hall's in trouble. Not cool.

2047
01:12:13.957 --> 01:12:15.479
Stealing keys and smuggling in

2048
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.000
underage dignitaries

2049
01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:19.544
is one thing, but... ninjas?

2050
01:12:19.545 --> 01:12:20.922
Sturgeon and Bruno and Cathy

2051
01:12:20.923 --> 01:12:22.297
are still in that meeting.

2052
01:12:22.298 --> 01:12:23.529
Maybe we should,

2053
01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:24.758
like, warn them?

2054
01:12:24.759 --> 01:12:26.261
Yeah, but...

2055
01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:27.761
ninjas!

2056
01:12:27.762 --> 01:12:29.805
Do my ears deceive me?

2057
01:12:29.806 --> 01:12:32.016
- You have the greatest school
- in all of the world,


2058
01:12:32.019 --> 01:12:33.163
And yet you are afraid

2059
01:12:33.164 --> 01:12:34.309
to defend it?

2060
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:35.582
Well, I am not.

2061
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:36.854
For the Hall!

2062
01:12:40.024 --> 01:12:41.255
You know what?

2063
01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.484
He's right.

2064
01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:43.695
Our school

2065
01:12:43.696 --> 01:12:44.903
is the greatest.

2066
01:12:44.904 --> 01:12:46.364
So let's go save our school

2067
01:12:46.365 --> 01:12:47.824
and our friends.

2068
01:12:50.201 --> 01:12:51.494
Sorry, who's that

2069
01:12:51.495 --> 01:12:52.786
crazy kid again?

2070
01:12:52.787 --> 01:12:53.830
It is he,

2071
01:12:53.831 --> 01:12:54.871
Francisco Diaz,

2072
01:12:54.872 --> 01:12:56.833
crown prince of Malbonia.

2073
01:12:58.084 --> 01:12:59.669
- The one you're doing
- all this for?


2074
01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:01.024
Oh no, I'm just in it

2075
01:13:01.025 --> 01:13:02.378
for the drive-thru.

2076
01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:04.547
OK, let's go get him.

2077
01:13:04.548 --> 01:13:06.592
Let's go, buddy.

2078
01:13:08.303 --> 01:13:11.513
Yup, definitely sleeping gas.

2079
01:13:11.514 --> 01:13:14.557
Which means we're in trouble...

2080
01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:17.894
and I know just what we need!

2081
01:13:17.895 --> 01:13:19.813
And that is what a school

2082
01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:21.086
like Macdonald Hall

2083
01:13:21.087 --> 01:13:22.357
needs in a headmaster,

2084
01:13:22.358 --> 01:13:25.568
which you will get in me,

2085
01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.863
William Theodore Stur...

2086
01:13:27.864 --> 01:13:31.283
Uh, Robert Jeremiah Hartley.

2087
01:13:31.284 --> 01:13:32.556
Oh!

2088
01:13:32.557 --> 01:13:33.827
Thank you.

2089
01:13:35.539 --> 01:13:37.247
Excellent speech, Hartley.

2090
01:13:38.521 --> 01:13:39.791
Thank you.

2091
01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:40.939
The Hall will be

2092
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.085
in excellent hands

2093
01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:43.129
if run by the man

2094
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.171
who wrote that.

2095
01:13:44.172 --> 01:13:46.089
Alright, William,

2096
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:47.300
if you have anything

2097
01:13:47.301 --> 01:13:48.509
else to add...

2098
01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:51.575
Well...

2099
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.472
Um...

2100
01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:56.766
I suppose that anybody

2101
01:13:56.767 --> 01:14:00.854
that is fa... familiar, uh,

2102
01:14:00.855 --> 01:14:02.981
with the, um...

2103
01:14:04.714 --> 01:14:06.442
I'm not a big fan of, uh...

2104
01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.862
improvisation. In some ways,

2105
01:14:08.863 --> 01:14:11.156
I find that, um...

2106
01:14:11.157 --> 01:14:12.659
Ladies and gentlemen,

2107
01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.159
I, Brunhilda Wexford,

2108
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.432
would like to... would like

2109
01:14:15.433 --> 01:14:16.703
to say a few words

2110
01:14:16.704 --> 01:14:17.977
on behalf of The Fi... uh,

2111
01:14:17.978 --> 01:14:19.248
Headmaster Sturgeon.

2112
01:14:19.249 --> 01:14:20.792
No! Maybe not

2113
01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:22.334
the right time for...

2114
01:14:22.335 --> 01:14:23.919
My dear,

2115
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.964
dear nephew, George,

2116
01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:28.006
well, to be honest,

2117
01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:29.446
is not my favorite person in

2118
01:14:29.447 --> 01:14:30.884
the world... bit of a snob really.

2119
01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:32.345
Brunhilda, Brunhilda,

2120
01:14:32.346 --> 01:14:33.803
stay focused, dear.

2121
01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:35.931
Yes, right.

2122
01:14:35.932 --> 01:14:38.100
This isn't about George.

2123
01:14:38.101 --> 01:14:39.915
It isn't even really

2124
01:14:39.916 --> 01:14:41.728
about Headmaster Sturgeon.

2125
01:14:41.729 --> 01:14:45.399
This is about change. Right.

2126
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.277
Do you remember those things

2127
01:14:47.278 --> 01:14:49.152
we used to say to the kids?

2128
01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:51.613
You know: "Change is a part

2129
01:14:51.614 --> 01:14:52.866
"of growing up

2130
01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:54.116
and it's a part of life,

2131
01:14:54.117 --> 01:14:56.577
and change helps us grow..."

2132
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.792
Ha! New heels.

2133
01:15:04.168 --> 01:15:05.566
Let's be honest.

2134
01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.962
Change isn't good.

2135
01:15:06.963 --> 01:15:08.715
Change means losing

2136
01:15:08.716 --> 01:15:10.465
what you're used to.

2137
01:15:10.466 --> 01:15:11.988
We had to change our mascot.

2138
01:15:11.989 --> 01:15:13.509
No fun, believe me.

2139
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.346
You know, I think perhaps this

2140
01:15:15.347 --> 01:15:17.180
is not the best time to talk...

2141
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:18.620
But that doesn't mean

2142
01:15:18.621 --> 01:15:20.058
it isn't gonna happen anyways,

2143
01:15:20.059 --> 01:15:21.517
to all of us,

2144
01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.166
and there's nobody better

2145
01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:24.813
at helping with that

2146
01:15:24.814 --> 01:15:26.899
than Mr. Sturgeon.

2147
01:15:28.985 --> 01:15:31.445
I know. I mean, uh,

2148
01:15:31.446 --> 01:15:33.010
George has told me

2149
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:34.572
that Headmaster Sturgeon

2150
01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:36.221
understands that kids make

2151
01:15:36.222 --> 01:15:37.867
mistakes and they mess up,

2152
01:15:37.868 --> 01:15:41.579
right? Even temporarily...

2153
01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.332
take down a school or two, huh?

2154
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:45.083
Isn't that right?

2155
01:15:45.084 --> 01:15:48.544
He cares about us.

2156
01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:52.715
Some change is good. Some isn't.

2157
01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:54.322
Macdonald Hall without

2158
01:15:54.323 --> 01:15:55.927
Headmaster Sturgeon...

2159
01:15:55.928 --> 01:15:57.597
Ha!

2160
01:15:57.598 --> 01:15:59.264
That isn't change.

2161
01:15:59.265 --> 01:16:01.851
That's just crazy.

2162
01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:06.313
Wait one minute.

2163
01:16:06.314 --> 01:16:07.399
You said "Sturgeon

2164
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.482
cares about us".

2165
01:16:08.483 --> 01:16:09.567
You're not a student

2166
01:16:09.568 --> 01:16:10.650
of this school...

2167
01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:12.090
or are you?

2168
01:16:12.091 --> 01:16:13.528
Pff!

2169
01:16:13.529 --> 01:16:15.218
Whoa, easy, easy there, Hartley.

2170
01:16:15.219 --> 01:16:16.906
No need to pick on a lady.

2171
01:16:16.907 --> 01:16:18.618
Or is she a lady? Hm?

2172
01:16:18.619 --> 01:16:20.327
How dare you say

2173
01:16:20.328 --> 01:16:21.809
such a thing? I ought to take

2174
01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.288
you outside right now...

2175
01:16:23.289 --> 01:16:24.373
Get out now!

2176
01:16:24.374 --> 01:16:26.792
I'm defending you, dear.

2177
01:16:31.673 --> 01:16:32.714
Oh, please!

2178
01:16:32.715 --> 01:16:34.321
This is obviously a ruse to end

2179
01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:35.925
this meeting and save Sturgeon!

2180
01:16:37.054 --> 01:16:38.178
Show's what you know.

2181
01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:39.722
He didn't know about any

2182
01:16:39.723 --> 01:16:41.264
of this. He has no control

2183
01:16:41.265 --> 01:16:42.537
over any of us.

2184
01:16:42.538 --> 01:16:43.808
Not helping, Bruno,

2185
01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:45.353
- but you can
- explain later. Uh...


2186
01:16:45.356 --> 01:16:46.521
If everybody could just

2187
01:16:46.522 --> 01:16:47.687
please follow me, quickly.

2188
01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:49.023
Quickly, quickly.

2189
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.360
Again, nice trick, Sturgeon,

2190
01:16:53.361 --> 01:16:54.508
but I'm not

2191
01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.653
falling for it.

2192
01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:03.871
Where's Jane Snow?

2193
01:17:03.872 --> 01:17:05.580
How can she just disappear?

2194
01:17:05.581 --> 01:17:07.417
- Alright, come on,
- keep moving.


2195
01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:16.842
- There's two more
- board members gone.


2196
01:17:16.845 --> 01:17:18.156
Not to worry,

2197
01:17:18.157 --> 01:17:19.469
I'm still here.

2198
01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:24.433
Hartley!

2199
01:17:24.434 --> 01:17:26.561
This way, let's go, let's go!

2200
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:31.190
Okay, I know a shortcut.

2201
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:32.648
I had that sealed off last week.

2202
01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.444
- Yeah, I know you think
- you did, but...


2203
01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.198
Other way.

2204
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.787
Hold this. Hold this.

2205
01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:49.624
Hey! Are those my biscuits?

2206
01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:50.877
That's not working!

2207
01:17:50.878 --> 01:17:52.127
They're too light and fluffy!

2208
01:17:52.128 --> 01:17:54.547
- They're an award-winning
- recipe, of course they're light


2209
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.382
- And fluffy!
- We need something more


2210
01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:57.674
Than baked goods to save us!

2211
01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:03.597
It worked!

2212
01:18:03.598 --> 01:18:05.181
Elmer?

2213
01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:07.643
Everybody duck!

2214
01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:10.146
Whoa!

2215
01:18:10.147 --> 01:18:11.563
Chew on that!

2216
01:18:11.564 --> 01:18:14.399
It worked! It worked!

2217
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.714
All it needed was

2218
01:18:15.715 --> 01:18:17.026
a little more awesome,

2219
01:18:17.027 --> 01:18:18.279
and also a couple extra screws

2220
01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.529
in the backpack, but still,

2221
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.761
the Viscositizer's a win!

2222
01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:21.990
Nice job!

2223
01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:24.285
- Okay, we need to find
- the rest of the board members.


2224
01:18:24.288 --> 01:18:27.412
Ladies, if you can hear me:

2225
01:18:27.413 --> 01:18:29.122
for the Hall's honor!

2226
01:18:36.422 --> 01:18:37.589
Yes!

2227
01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:42.678
Yeah!

2228
01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:57.276
This is all...

2229
01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.385
As soon as we have our prince,

2230
01:19:01.386 --> 01:19:03.448
you all will go.

2231
01:19:03.449 --> 01:19:04.740
But until then...

2232
01:19:31.519 --> 01:19:33.978
Hi, everyone!

2233
01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:35.794
Don't worry, we're gonna get you

2234
01:19:35.795 --> 01:19:37.607
out of here as soon as possible.

2235
01:19:37.608 --> 01:19:39.775
You're last.

2236
01:19:50.539 --> 01:19:51.746
Team one, where are you?

2237
01:19:51.747 --> 01:19:53.499
Come in!

2238
01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:57.127
Fire in the hole!

2239
01:20:00.467 --> 01:20:03.925
Pando? Is that you?

2240
01:20:03.926 --> 01:20:07.679
Save our school!

2241
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.806
William,

2242
01:20:08.807 --> 01:20:09.931
what is going on?

2243
01:20:09.932 --> 01:20:11.309
Why am I getting texts

2244
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:12.684
from my girls about ninjas?

2245
01:20:12.685 --> 01:20:13.748
Do you hear

2246
01:20:13.749 --> 01:20:14.810
what they're chanting?

2247
01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.605
Save our school.

2248
01:20:16.606 --> 01:20:18.398
Your girls

2249
01:20:18.399 --> 01:20:20.567
and my boys.

2250
01:20:20.568 --> 01:20:22.070
Speaking of boys, all I have

2251
01:20:22.071 --> 01:20:23.570
to do now is get Francisco back.

2252
01:20:23.571 --> 01:20:24.947
Sorry, who?

2253
01:20:24.948 --> 01:20:26.322
Uh, never mind.

2254
01:20:26.323 --> 01:20:27.574
It doesn't matter.

2255
01:20:27.575 --> 01:20:28.824
It's not important.

2256
01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:30.369
Boots, man, you did it! Well,

2257
01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:31.911
I mean, we did it. But you...

2258
01:20:31.912 --> 01:20:33.476
Bruno! Where's the prince?

2259
01:20:33.477 --> 01:20:35.039
I thought you had him.

2260
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.542
I did, and... well,

2261
01:20:36.543 --> 01:20:38.042
then I didn't, so...

2262
01:20:38.043 --> 01:20:39.170
Wait, wait.

2263
01:20:39.171 --> 01:20:40.295
What prince?

2264
01:20:40.296 --> 01:20:42.005
Bruno! Boots!

2265
01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:46.842
That was so much fun!

2266
01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:47.949
That prince.

2267
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:49.053
He's with one of them!

2268
01:20:49.054 --> 01:20:50.472
Save our prince!

2269
01:20:50.473 --> 01:20:51.889
No, no, no, no, no!

2270
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.105
It's alright! This is Pando,

2271
01:20:53.106 --> 01:20:55.506
- head of the Royal Commandos.
- Wait, the Royal Commandos?


2272
01:20:55.519 --> 01:20:59.670
- Could somebody
- please tell me what is


2273
01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:00.732
going on here, exactly?

2274
01:21:00.733 --> 01:21:04.778
I would appreciate this, too.

2275
01:21:04.779 --> 01:21:06.821
And you would be...

2276
01:21:08.366 --> 01:21:09.907
It is I, King Balthazar Diaz

2277
01:21:09.908 --> 01:21:11.472
of the Royal Republic

2278
01:21:11.473 --> 01:21:13.035
of Malbonia.

2279
01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:15.413
Malbonia.

2280
01:21:15.414 --> 01:21:17.667
Malbonia.

2281
01:21:19.335 --> 01:21:20.503
But why would you

2282
01:21:20.504 --> 01:21:21.670
want to come here,

2283
01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:23.694
to this place of commoners?

2284
01:21:23.695 --> 01:21:25.715
No offense intended.

2285
01:21:25.716 --> 01:21:27.176
Because, Father, ever since

2286
01:21:27.177 --> 01:21:28.635
I became video pals with

2287
01:21:28.636 --> 01:21:30.033
Bruno Walton, I saw how much fun

2288
01:21:30.034 --> 01:21:31.429
you can have in a school!

2289
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:33.390
- Even a school
- that is not a castle


2290
01:21:33.393 --> 01:21:34.558
And has no statues

2291
01:21:34.559 --> 01:21:35.725
of myself inside.

2292
01:21:35.726 --> 01:21:36.894
It is true,

2293
01:21:36.895 --> 01:21:38.060
I am quite fun.

2294
01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:40.396
But that is ridiculous!

2295
01:21:40.397 --> 01:21:41.878
School is not for fun.

2296
01:21:41.879 --> 01:21:43.358
School is for important things,

2297
01:21:43.359 --> 01:21:45.090
like learning how to be a king.

2298
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:46.820
You understand this, yes?

2299
01:21:46.821 --> 01:21:48.051
Actually, Your Highness,

2300
01:21:48.052 --> 01:21:49.280
I happen to believe that when

2301
01:21:49.281 --> 01:21:50.491
you let children guide their

2302
01:21:50.492 --> 01:21:51.700
own learning experience,

2303
01:21:51.701 --> 01:21:53.182
their sense of self

2304
01:21:53.183 --> 01:21:54.661
engenders so...

2305
01:21:54.662 --> 01:21:55.830
I think what my well-meaning

2306
01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:56.996
colleague is trying to say

2307
01:21:56.997 --> 01:21:58.144
is that kids know

2308
01:21:58.145 --> 01:21:59.290
what they need.

2309
01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:00.835
I need a snack!

2310
01:22:02.545 --> 01:22:04.422
Believe it! Not only

2311
01:22:04.423 --> 01:22:06.297
endangering the board

2312
01:22:06.298 --> 01:22:09.509
and the entire school, but me!

2313
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:12.136
Well, and you, of course.

2314
01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:13.952
While saving your hide,

2315
01:22:13.953 --> 01:22:15.765
Hartley.

2316
01:22:15.766 --> 01:22:18.976
While saving all of our hides.

2317
01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:20.541
Which the board has agreed

2318
01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:22.104
is a pretty great example

2319
01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:24.128
of how well Headmaster Sturgeon

2320
01:22:24.129 --> 01:22:26.150
has prepared his students

2321
01:22:26.151 --> 01:22:28.445
- for life beyond Macdonald Hall.
- What?


2322
01:22:29.614 --> 01:22:30.780
- Plus, any school
- that can make a prince travel


2323
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:32.156
halfway around the world for fun

2324
01:22:32.157 --> 01:22:33.596
must be doing

2325
01:22:33.597 --> 01:22:35.034
something right.

2326
01:22:36.559 --> 01:22:38.079
I don't know what to say.

2327
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.540
Well, I do.

2328
01:22:44.442 --> 01:22:45.545
Oh, God.

2329
01:22:45.546 --> 01:22:47.297
Oh, God.

2330
01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.633
You know, she is right.

2331
01:22:50.634 --> 01:22:52.344
Yes. Miss Snow is

2332
01:22:52.345 --> 01:22:54.053
tough, but fair.

2333
01:22:54.054 --> 01:22:56.098
No, no. Your colleague, here.

2334
01:22:56.099 --> 01:22:58.140
The beautiful.

2335
01:22:58.141 --> 01:22:59.664
Eugenia Scrimmage.

2336
01:22:59.665 --> 01:23:01.185
Currently single.

2337
01:23:01.186 --> 01:23:02.187
Oh!

2338
01:23:04.357 --> 01:23:05.523
- I have ignored
- what my son wants


2339
01:23:05.524 --> 01:23:06.630
for too long,

2340
01:23:06.631 --> 01:23:07.734
and I will fix this.

2341
01:23:07.735 --> 01:23:09.985
And I will fix the school

2342
01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:11.301
for the damage that my Royal

2343
01:23:11.302 --> 01:23:12.614
Commandos have done to it!

2344
01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:15.074
Well, one down, at least.

2345
01:23:15.075 --> 01:23:16.992
I'm sorry?

2346
01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:18.850
Sorry. What my friend means is

2347
01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:20.705
that Miss Scrimmage's academy

2348
01:23:20.706 --> 01:23:21.832
was also damaged

2349
01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:22.957
a few weeks ago, so...

2350
01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:24.585
We have to wait for that to be

2351
01:23:24.586 --> 01:23:26.210
fixed, and... steam cleaned.

2352
01:23:26.211 --> 01:23:27.775
Or, you can allow me to pay

2353
01:23:27.776 --> 01:23:29.338
for one brand new school!

2354
01:23:29.339 --> 01:23:31.340
That way, Mr. Sturgeon

2355
01:23:31.341 --> 01:23:32.447
and Miss Scrimmage

2356
01:23:32.448 --> 01:23:33.551
can teach together forever!

2357
01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:35.595
No!

2358
01:23:35.596 --> 01:23:37.890
- No, I mean, I think,
- you know, when it's possible...


2359
01:23:37.893 --> 01:23:39.079
There is such a thing as

2360
01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.266
too much change.

2361
01:23:40.267 --> 01:23:42.061
Well! I can just pay for

2362
01:23:42.062 --> 01:23:43.853
both schools to be fixed!

2363
01:23:43.854 --> 01:23:46.564
Rush job! Around the clock!

2364
01:23:46.565 --> 01:23:48.046
Would you say one week

2365
01:23:48.047 --> 01:23:49.525
is too long to wait?

2366
01:23:49.526 --> 01:23:51.320
- Oh, thank you, that would
- really help us


2367
01:23:51.323 --> 01:23:52.696
- Let things
- get back to normal.


2368
01:23:57.952 --> 01:23:59.495
Wow. I suppose this means you

2369
01:23:59.496 --> 01:24:01.037
guys can be roommates again!

you were right, you know?

2416

Maybe we can do

2418
01:26:04.078 --> 01:26:05.745
