00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:41.396
<i>The magnificence of the Ambersons</i>

2
00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.940
<i>began in 1873.</i>

3
00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.609
<i>Their splendor lasted
throughout all the years</i>


4
00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:50.613
<i>that saw their midland town
spread and darken into a city.</i>


5
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:53.783
<i>In that town, in those days,</i>

6
00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.744
<i>all the women who wore silk or velvet</i>

7
00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.872
<i>knew all the other women
who wore silk or velvet,</i>


8
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:02.292
<i>and everybody knew everybody else's
family horse and carriage.</i>


9
00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.211
<i>The only public conveyance was the streetcar.</i>

10
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:06.337
Yoo-hoo!

11
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.090
<i>A lady could whistle to it
from an upstairs window,</i>


12
00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:12.260
<i>and the car would halt at once
and wait for her</i>


13
00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:16.014
<i>while she shut the window,
put on her hat and coat,</i>


14
00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:19.017
<i>went downstairs, found an umbrella,</i>

15
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.352
<i>told the girl what to have for dinner,</i>

16
00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:24.606
<i>and came forth from the house.</i>

17
00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.900
<i>Too slow for us nowadays,</i>

18
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.235
<i>because the faster we're carried,</i>

19
00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.988
<i>the less time we have to spare.</i>

20
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.240
<i>During the earlier years of this period,</i>

21
00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:37.619
<i>while bangs and bustles
were having their way with women,</i>


22
00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:39.621
<i>there were seen men of all ages</i>

23
00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:43.082
<i>to whom a hat meant only
that rigid, tall, silk thing</i>


24
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.752
<i>known to impudence as a stovepipe.</i>

25
00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:49.756
<i>But the long contagion of the derby
had arrived.</i>


26
00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:52.342
<i>One season the crown of this hat
would be a bucket.</i>


27
00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.594
<i>Next it would be a spoon.</i>

28
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:57.180
<i>Every house still kept its boot jack,</i>

29
00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.725
<i>but high-top boots gave way
to shoes and congress gaiters,</i>


30
00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:04.479
<i>and these were played through fashions
that shaped them now with toes like box-ends,</i>


31
00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:08.024
<i>and now with toes
like the prows of racing shells.</i>


32
00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:10.902
<i>Trousers with a crease
were considered plebeian.</i>


33
00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.947
<i>The crease proved that the garment
had lain upon a shelf</i>


34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.949
<i>and hence was ready-made.</i>

35
00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:19.494
<i>With evening dress
a gentleman wore a tan overcoat,</i>


36
00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:23.957
<i>so short that his black coattails hung visible
five inches below the overcoat.</i>


37
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.376
<i>But after a season or two
he lengthened his overcoat</i>


38
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.378
<i>till it touched his heels,</i>

39
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:31.339
<i>and he passed out of his tight trousers</i>

40
00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.550
<i>into trousers like great bags.</i>

41
00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:39.931
<i>In those days,
they had time for everything.</i>


42
00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:42.976
<i>Time for sleigh rides and balls</i>

43
00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.937
<i>and assemblies and cotillions,</i>

44
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.939
<i>and open house on New Year's,</i>

45
00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:50.400
<i>and all-day picnics in the woods,</i>

46
00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:54.070
<i>and even that prettiest
of all vanished customs,</i>


47
00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.197
<i>the serenade.</i>

48
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.824
<i>Come a summer night,</i>

49
00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.869
<i>young men would bring an orchestra
under a pretty girl's window,</i>


50
00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:04.497
<i>and flute, harp, fiddle,
cello, cornet, and bass viol</i>


51
00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:07.959
<i>would presently release their melodies
to the dulcet stars.</i>


52
00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:16.593
<i>Against so homespun a background,</i>

53
00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.470
<i>the magnificence of the Ambersons</i>

54
00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.473
<i>was as conspicuous
as a brass band at a funeral.</i>


55
00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:25.184
- There it is!
- The Amberson mansion!


56
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.812
- The pride of the town.
- Well, well.


57
00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.481
$60,000 for the woodwork alone.

58
00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:33.192
- Hot and cold running water.
- Upstairs and down.


59
00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:36.821
And stationary washstands
in every last bedroom in the place.


60
00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:46.706
- Is Miss Amberson at home?
- No, sir, Mr. Morgan.


61
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.458
Miss Amberson's not home.

62
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.085
Well, thanks, Sam.

63
00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:04.807
No, sir. Miss Amberson
ain't at home to you, Mr. Morgan.


64
00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:07.268
Thanks.

65
00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:10.939
- I guess she's still mad at him.
- Who?


66
00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.816
- Isabel.
- Major Amberson's daughter.


67
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.277
Eugene Morgan's her best beau.

68
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.155
Took a bit too much to drink
the other night, right out here,


69
00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:22.700
and stepped clean through the bass fiddle
serenadin' her.


70
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.702
Well, well.

71
00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:27.205
I haven't seen her
since she got back from abroad.


72
00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:28.831
Isabel?

73
00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:31.709
Well, sir, I don't know
as I know just how to put it...


74
00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:35.046
but she's ‒ she's kind of a...

75
00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.090
delightful looking young lady.

76
00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:56.567
<i>Wilbur? Wilbur Minafer?</i>

77
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.571
<i>I never thought he'd get her.
Well, what do you know!</i>


78
00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:03.825
Well, Wilbur may not be any Apollo,
as it were,


79
00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:05.618
but he's a steady young businessman.

80
00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:07.286
Wilbur Minafer!

81
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.915
Looks like Isabel's pretty sensible
for such a showy girl.


82
00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.500
To think of her taking him.

83
00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.461
Yes, just because a man any woman
would like a thousand times better


84
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:17.463
was a little wild
one night at a serenade.

85
00:05:17.547 --> 00:05:21.300
What she minds was his making
a clown of himself in her own front yard.


86
00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:23.469
Made her think
he didn't care much about her.


87
00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:27.265
She's probably mistaken, but it's too late
for her to think anything else now.


88
00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:30.184
The wedding will be
a big Amberson-style thing ‒


89
00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.730
raw oysters floating
in scooped-out blocks of ice,


90
00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:35.648
a band, from out of town,

91
00:05:35.732 --> 00:05:37.191
and then Wilbur will take Isabel

92
00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:40.069
on the carefullest little wedding trip
he can manage.


93
00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:42.155
And she'll be a good wife to him.

94
00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:45.992
But they'll have the worst-spoiled lot
of children this town will ever see.


95
00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.077
How on earth do you figure that out,
Mrs. Foster?


96
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.496
She couldn't love Wilbur, could she?

97
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.126
Well, it'll all go to her children.
And she'll ruin them.


98
00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:59.797
<i>The prophetess proved
to be mistaken in a single detail merely.</i>


99
00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:03.051
<i>Wilbur and Isabel did not have "children."</i>

100
00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:04.302
<i>They had only one.</i>

101
00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:05.720
<i>"Only one."</i>

102
00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:09.098
<i>But I'd like to know if he isn't spoiled enough
for a whole carload!</i>


103
00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:12.351
<i>Again, she found none to challenge her.</i>

104
00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:15.855
<i>George Amberson Minafer,
the major's one grandchild,</i>


105
00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:17.482
<i>was a princely terror.</i>

106
00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:18.816
Hey!

107
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.153
By golly,
I guess you think you own this town!


108
00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:26.324
<i>There were people,
grown people they were,</i>


109
00:06:26.407 --> 00:06:29.202
<i>who expressed themselves longingly.</i>

110
00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.788
<i>They did hope to live
to see the day, they said,</i>


111
00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.874
<i>when that boy would get his comeuppance.</i>

112
00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:37.376
- His what?
- His comeuppance.


113
00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.089
Something's bound to
take him down someday.


114
00:06:41.172 --> 00:06:42.757
I only want to be there.

115
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.761
Eh, look at the girly-curlies!
Eh, look at the girly-curlies!


116
00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:49.222
Say, bub, where'd you steal
your mother's old sash?


117
00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:51.224
Your sister stole it for me!

118
00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:54.185
She stole it off our old clothesline
and gave it to me!


119
00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:57.647
You go get your hair cut!
Yeah, and I haven't got any sister!


120
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.775
Yeah, I know you haven't at home.
I mean the one that's in jail!


121
00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.860
I dare you to get
out of that pony cart.

122
00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.490
- I dare you outside that gate!
- Dare ya halfway here, I dare ya!


123
00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:10.785
Here I come, you dirty... rat!

124
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.835
- Boy! Boy!
- Father! Father!


125
00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:21.963
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size, you big bully!


126
00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:25.133
Hey, boy!

127
00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:27.468
- Father!
- Boy!


128
00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:29.428
- Father!
- Boy!


129
00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:31.681
That'll ‒ That'll be enough of that!

130
00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:33.891
You stop that, you!

131
00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:37.019
- Ow!
- I guess you don't know who I am!


132
00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:39.438
Yes, I do,
and you're a disgrace to your mother!


133
00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:41.732
- You shut up about my mother!
- Ow!


134
00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:43.901
She oughta be ashamed
of a bad little boy like you!


135
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.362
Pull down your vest,
you old billy goat, you!


136
00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:49.365
Pull down your vest,
and wipe off your chin, and ‒


137
00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:50.950
- and go to ‒
- What?


138
00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:53.578
"This was heard not only by myself,

139
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.455
but by my wife,
and the lady who lives next door."


140
00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.791
- He's an old liar.
- Georgie.


141
00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.169
You mustn't say "liar."

142
00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:04.255
Dear, did you say
what he says you did?

143
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.801
Well, Grandpa wouldn't wipe his shoe
on that old storyteller.


144
00:08:08.885 --> 00:08:10.386
Georgie, you mustn't.

145
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:12.763
I mean, none of us Ambersons
wouldn't have anything to do with him.


146
00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:14.765
That's not what we're talking about.

147
00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:17.393
I'll bet if he wanted to see any of us,
he'd have to go around to the side door.


148
00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:20.271
Please, Father!

149
00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.149
From his letter he doesn't seem
a very tactful person, but ‒


150
00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:26.235
- He's just riffraff.
- Oh, you mustn't say so.


151
00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:31.032
And you must promise me
never to use those bad words again.


152
00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:32.700
I promise not to.

153
00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:37.663
Unless I get mad at somebody.

154
00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:41.500
Wait'll they send him away to school.

155
00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:43.169
<i>Then</i> he'll get it.

156
00:08:43.252 --> 00:08:46.047
They'll knock the stuffin' out of him.

157
00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:49.258
<i>But George returned
with the same stuffing.</i>


158
00:08:49.342 --> 00:08:51.093
Ow!

159
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:54.013
Got any sense? See here, bub.
Does your mother know you're out?


160
00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:56.432
Turn down your pants, you would-be dude!

161
00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.810
<i>When Mr. George Amberson Minafer
came home for the holidays</i>


162
00:08:59.894 --> 00:09:01.395
<i>in his sophomore year,</i>

163
00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:06.776
<i>nothing about him encouraged any hope
that he had received his comeuppance.</i>


164
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.947
<i>Cards were out for
a ball in his honor,</i>

165
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.783
<i>and this pageant of the tenantry</i>

166
00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:17.245
<i>was the last of
the great long-remembered dances</i>


167
00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:19.455
<i>that everybody talked about.</i>

168
00:09:29.048 --> 00:09:30.758
Hello there!

169
00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:37.974
They had her in a good place
in my big bow window.


170
00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:41.727
Suppose that's where they'll put the major
when his time comes.


171
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:44.855
Now, don't you look at me
like that, Major!


172
00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:46.190
- Georgie!
- Sam.


173
00:09:46.274 --> 00:09:48.734
You look fine!

174
00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:51.654
There was a time though,
in your fourth month,


175
00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:54.782
that you were so puny
nobody thought you'd live.


176
00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:56.951
- Where's Fanny?
- Remember you very well indeed.


177
00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:01.247
- Isabel.
- Eugene.


178
00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:04.792
This your boy, Isabel?

179
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.920
- George, this is Mr. Morgan.
- Remember you very well indeed.


180
00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.172
George, you never saw me before
in your life.


181
00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:13.509
But from now on you're going to
see a lot of me. I hope.


182
00:10:13.592 --> 00:10:16.387
- I hope so too, Eugene.
- Where's Wilbur?


183
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.557
You'll find him in the game room
with some of the others.


184
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.809
He never was much for parties.
Remember?


185
00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:23.686
Yes, I remember.

186
00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.273
- I'll come back for a dance.
- Please do.


187
00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:30.234
- Eugene Morgan, Major Amberson.
- Well, well, well.


188
00:10:30.318 --> 00:10:33.237
Remember you very well indeed.
Remember you very well indeed.


189
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:34.405
Miss Morgan.

190
00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:36.490
- Jack!
- Gene!


191
00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.410
Remember you very well <i>indeed.</i>

192
00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:41.787
You don't remember her either, Georgie.

193
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:43.539
But of course you will.

194
00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:45.624
Miss Morgan's from out of town.

195
00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:49.628
You might take her up to the dancing.
I think you've pretty well done your duty here.


196
00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:51.047
Be delighted.

197
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.719
What did you say your name was?

198
00:10:56.802 --> 00:10:58.012
- Morgan.
- Oh.


199
00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:02.141
- Well, I'm certainly glad you're back.
- It's nice to be back too, Jack.


200
00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.310
- It's been a long time.
- Who's that?


201
00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:07.021
Oh, I didn't catch his name
when my mother presented him to me.


202
00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:09.190
- You mean the queer-looking duck?
- The who?


203
00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:12.151
- The queer-looking duck.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.


204
00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:14.153
The one with him is my Uncle Jack.

205
00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:16.739
Honorable Jack Amberson.
I thought everybody knew him.


206
00:11:16.822 --> 00:11:18.949
He looks as though everybody
ought to know him.


207
00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:20.951
Seems to run in your family.

208
00:11:21.035 --> 00:11:24.663
I suppose most everybody does know him,
out in this part of the country especially.


209
00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:26.749
Uncle Jack's pretty well-known.

210
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:29.627
- He's a congressman, you know.
- Oh, really?


211
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.214
Oh, yes. The family always liked to
have someone in Congress.


212
00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.216
It's sort of a
good thing, in one way.

213
00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:36.801
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello!


214
00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:38.427
- Lucy!
- Hello, Garland.


215
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:40.638
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello.


216
00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:43.015
How did all these ducks
get to know you so quick?


217
00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:46.018
- Oh, I've been here a week.
- Seems to me you've been pretty busy.


218
00:11:46.102 --> 00:11:47.436
Most of these ‒

219
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.063
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello.


220
00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:53.275
Most of these ducks, I don't know what my mother
wanted to invite 'em here for anyway.


221
00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:54.693
Don't you like them?

222
00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:58.572
I used to be president of a club we had here
and some of them belonged to it.


223
00:11:58.656 --> 00:12:01.450
But I don't care much
for that sort of thing anymore.


224
00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:03.494
I really don't see
why my mother invited 'em.


225
00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:06.414
Maybe she didn't want to offend
their fathers and mothers.


226
00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:10.543
I hardly think that my mother need worry
about offending anybody in this old town.


227
00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.796
Must be wonderful, Mr. Amberson.
Mr. Minafer, I mean.


228
00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.506
What must be wonderful?

229
00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:17.883
- To be so important as that.
- Oh, that isn't important.


230
00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.552
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


231
00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:21.011
Anybody that really is anybody

232
00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:24.056
oughta be able to do about as they like
in their own town, I should think.


233
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.809
Hello!

234
00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:29.854
Well.

235
00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:32.648
- How's that for a bit of freshness.
- What was?


236
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:35.151
That queer-looking duck
waving his hand at me like that.


237
00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:37.111
He meant me.

238
00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:38.821
Oh, he did?

239
00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:40.698
Everybody seems to mean you.

240
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:45.995
See here. Are you engaged to anybody?

241
00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:47.288
No.

242
00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:49.290
You certainly seem to know
a good many people.


243
00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:52.751
Papa does. He used to live here
in this town before I was born.


244
00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:55.588
- Where do you live now?
- We've lived all over.


245
00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:59.049
What do you keep moving around so for?

246
00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:01.844
- Is he a promoter?
- No, he's an inventor.


247
00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:03.554
Oh? What's he invented?

248
00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:05.723
- Georgie.
- Grandfather.


249
00:13:05.806 --> 00:13:09.435
Just lately he's been working on
a new kind of horseless carriage.


250
00:13:09.518 --> 00:13:12.313
Horseless carri ‒ Automobile?

251
00:13:12.396 --> 00:13:13.981
Well, well.

252
00:13:14.064 --> 00:13:16.400
Don't you approve of them, Mr. Minafer?

253
00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:19.320
Oh, yes, they're all right.

254
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.740
You know,
I'm just beginning to understand.


255
00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:24.283
Understand what?

256
00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.036
What?

257
00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:29.872
What it means to be
a real Amberson in this town.


258
00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:34.168
Papa told me something about it before we came,
but I see he didn't say half enough.


259
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:37.087
Did your father say he knew the family
before he left here?


260
00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:40.716
I don't think he meant to boast of it.
He spoke of it quite calmly.


261
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:43.010
Most girls are usually pretty fresh.

262
00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:44.803
They oughta go to a man's college
for about a year.


263
00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:48.265
They'd get taught a few things
about freshness.


264
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:51.560
Look here. Who sent you those flowers
you keep making such a fuss over?


265
00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:53.896
- Lucy.
- He did.


266
00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:55.981
- Who's he?
- The queer-looking duck.


267
00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:58.317
I've come for that dance.

268
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.320
Oh, him.
I suppose he's some old widower.


269
00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:03.447
Some old widower.

270
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:06.367
Yes, he is a widower.
I ought to have told you before.


271
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.536
- He's my father.
- Oh.


272
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:11.330
Well, that's a horse on me.
If I'd known he was your father ‒


273
00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:15.209
This is our dance.
But I guess I won't insist on it.


274
00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:17.503
George, dear, are you enjoying the party?

275
00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:18.963
Yes, Mother, very much.

276
00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:21.966
Will you please excuse us?
Miss Morgan.


277
00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:28.097
- Eggnog, anybody?
- Not for me, sir.


278
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.432
I see you kept your promise, Gene.

279
00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:34.353
Isabel, I remember the last drink
Gene ever had.


280
00:14:34.436 --> 00:14:37.565
Fact is, I believe if he hadn't
broken that bass fiddle,


281
00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:39.567
Isabel never would have taken Wilbur.

282
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.444
- What do you think, Wilbur?
- I shouldn't be surprised.


283
00:14:42.528 --> 00:14:45.531
If your notion's right,
I'm glad Gene broke the fiddle.


284
00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:47.825
What do you say about it, Isabel?

285
00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:50.452
By Jingo, she's blushing.

286
00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:52.788
Who wouldn't blush?

287
00:14:53.956 --> 00:14:58.002
The important thing is that Wilbur
did get her, and not only got her, but kept her.


288
00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:00.879
There's another important thing.
That is, for me.


289
00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:05.009
In fact, it's the only thing that makes me
forgive that bass viol for getting in my way.


290
00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:07.469
Well, what's that?

291
00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:08.971
Lucy.

292
00:15:09.054 --> 00:15:10.639
You havin' a good time?

293
00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:13.809
- I don't suppose you ever gave up smoking.
- No, sir.


294
00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:15.894
Well, I've got some Havanas.

295
00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:19.148
Do your ears burn, young lady?

296
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:21.150
Would you care for some refreshments,
Miss Morgan?


297
00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:22.484
Yes, thanks.

298
00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:26.322
What did you say your name was?

299
00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:28.532
- Morgan.
- Funny name.


300
00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:30.701
Everybody else's name always is.

301
00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.578
I didn't mean it was really funny.

302
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.831
That's just one of the crowd's
bits of horsing in college.


303
00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:38.709
I knew your last name was Morgan.
I meant your first name.


304
00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.252
Lucy.

305
00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:42.963
Well!

306
00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:44.965
Is Lucy a funny name too?

307
00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:46.884
No.

308
00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:48.719
- Lucy's very much all right.
- Thanks.


309
00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:51.347
- Here they are. Here they are, Henry!
- Are they?


310
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.350
- Thanks for what?
- Thanks about letting my name be Lucy.


311
00:15:57.686 --> 00:15:59.730
Good-bye. I've got this dance with her.

312
00:15:59.813 --> 00:16:01.398
- With who?
- With Isabel, of course.


313
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:03.651
Eighteen years have passed. 
But have they?

314
00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:05.903
Tell me, have you danced
with poor old Fanny too this evening?


315
00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:07.321
Twice. Wilbur.

316
00:16:07.404 --> 00:16:09.782
By gosh, old times certainly
are starting all over again.


317
00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:12.242
"Old times." Not a bit.
There aren't any old times.


318
00:16:12.326 --> 00:16:15.621
When times have gone
they aren't old, they're dead.


319
00:16:15.704 --> 00:16:18.165
There aren't any times but new times.

320
00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:30.511
What are you studying in school?

321
00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:33.055
- I beg your pardon?
- What are you studying in school?


322
00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:34.515
- College.
- College.


323
00:16:34.598 --> 00:16:36.350
Oh, lots of useless guff.

324
00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:39.645
- Why don't you study some useful guff?
- What do you mean, "useful?"


325
00:16:39.728 --> 00:16:42.356
Something you could use later
in your business or profession.


326
00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:44.817
I don't intend to go into
any business or profession.


327
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.026
- No?
- No.


328
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.113
- Why not?
- Well, just look at them.


329
00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:51.407
That's a fine career
for a man, isn't it?

330
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.076
Lawyers, bankers, politicians.

331
00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:57.663
What do they ever get out of life,
I'd like to know.


332
00:16:57.746 --> 00:17:00.165
What they know about real things?

333
00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:01.625
Where do they ever get?

334
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.503
What do you want to be?

335
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:07.131
A yachtsman.

336
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.989
What good are they?
They always break down.


337
00:17:32.072 --> 00:17:36.076
- They do not always break down.
- Oh, of course they do.


338
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.370
Horseless carriages.

339
00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:40.372
- Automobiles.
- Hmm?


340
00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:43.167
People aren't going to spend their lives
lying on their backs in the road,


341
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.461
letting grease drip on their faces.

342
00:17:45.544 --> 00:17:47.880
No, I think your father
better forget about 'em.


343
00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:51.842
Papa would be so grateful
if he could have your advice.


344
00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.511
I don't know that I've done anything
to be insulted for.


345
00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:58.599
You know, I don't mind your being
such a lofty person at all.


346
00:17:58.682 --> 00:18:00.476
I think it's ever so interesting.

347
00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.978
- But Papa's a great man.
- Is he?


348
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:04.605
Well, let us hope so.

349
00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:06.565
I hope so, I'm sure.

350
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.073
How lovely your mother is.

351
00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:16.658
I think she is.

352
00:18:16.742 --> 00:18:19.995
She's the gracefullest woman.
She dances like a girl of 16.


353
00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.248
Most girls of 16 are pretty bad dancers.

354
00:18:23.332 --> 00:18:25.501
Anyhow...

355
00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:28.629
I wouldn't dance with one of them
unless I had to.


356
00:18:28.712 --> 00:18:31.673
Uh, the snow's fine for sleighing.

357
00:18:31.757 --> 00:18:33.842
I'll be by for you in a cutter
at ten minutes after 2:00.


358
00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:35.177
- Tomorrow?
- Thank you, Isabel.


359
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.386
I can't possibly go ‒

360
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.806
Bravo! Bravissimo!

361
00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:40.265
Papa.

362
00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:42.309
Lucy.

363
00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:43.852
I'll get your things.

364
00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:47.606
If you don't, I'm going to sit
in a cutter at your front gate,


365
00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:50.609
and if you try to go out with anybody else
he has to whip me before he gets to you.


366
00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:52.611
Hey, you two,
I think you oughta take this,


367
00:18:52.694 --> 00:18:54.905
in case you break down
in that horseless carriage.


368
00:18:54.988 --> 00:18:56.323
- Uncle Jack.
- Take a scarf, Lucy dear.


369
00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.866
- Good night, Isabel.
- Come here.


370
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.994
- Fanny, where are you going?
- Oh, just out to look.


371
00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:03.163
Do you think
you'll be warm enough, Lucy?


372
00:19:03.247 --> 00:19:05.874
- Well?
- Oh, nothing.


373
00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.918
Here. Hold this.

374
00:19:08.001 --> 00:19:10.671
Who is this fellow, Morgan?

375
00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:14.633
Why, he's a man
with a pretty daughter, Georgie.


376
00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:17.094
Certainly seems to be
awfully at home here,


377
00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:19.596
the way he was dancing
with Mother and Aunt Fanny.


378
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.224
Well, I'm afraid your Aunt Fanny's heart

379
00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:25.602
was stirred by...
ancient recollections, Georgie.


380
00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:29.064
You mean, she used
to be silly about him?

381
00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.276
She wasn't considered, uh... singular.

382
00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:34.695
He was, uh ‒ He was popular.

383
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.446
Oh.

384
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.449
Do you take the same passionate interest
in the parents of every girl you dance with?


385
00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:42.160
Oh, dry up. I
only wanted to know ‒

386
00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:44.788
Lucy, about that sleigh ride.

387
00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:48.166
I want to look at that, uh,
automobile carriage of yours, Gene.


388
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.752
- Fanny, you'll catch cold.
- Want to ride in that thing, see if it's safe.


389
00:19:50.836 --> 00:19:52.754
- Good night, Isabel.
- Good night, Eugene.


390
00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:55.757
- You be ready at ten minutes after 2:00.
- No, I won't.


391
00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:57.801
Yes, you will. 
Ten minutes after 2:00.

392
00:19:57.885 --> 00:20:00.804
- Look at that, Fanny!
- Oh, goodness!


393
00:20:00.888 --> 00:20:04.016
- Yes, I will.
- Come on, Gene! Show us how it works!


394
00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:06.143
If it <i>does</i> work!

395
00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:08.353
- Suppose you break down.
- Come on, Lucy!


396
00:20:08.437 --> 00:20:10.814
- I'm coming, Papa!
- I hope you're going to be warm enough.


397
00:20:10.898 --> 00:20:13.567
Got a blanket for you, Gene. Catch!

398
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.819
Good night! Bye! Bye!

399
00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:19.364
- Bye!
- Good night!


400
00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:24.119
- Papa?
- Huh?


401
00:20:24.202 --> 00:20:28.040
Papa, do you think George
is terribly arrogant and domineering?


402
00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:30.792
Uh, oh, he's still only a boy.

403
00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:34.630
Plenty of fine stuff in him.

404
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:39.801
Can't help but be.
He's... Isabel Amberson's son.


405
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.848
You liked her pretty well once,
I guess, Papa.


406
00:20:44.932 --> 00:20:47.935
Yes. Do still.

407
00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:50.604
I know that isn't all
that's worrying you.


408
00:20:50.687 --> 00:20:52.731
Well, several things.

409
00:20:52.814 --> 00:20:55.150
I've been a little bothered
about your father too.


410
00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:56.234
Why?

411
00:20:56.318 --> 00:20:58.362
It seems to me he looks so badly.

412
00:20:58.445 --> 00:21:01.615
He isn't any different than the way
he's looked all his life that I can see.


413
00:21:01.698 --> 00:21:04.868
He's been worried about some
investments he made last year.


414
00:21:04.952 --> 00:21:07.037
I think the worry's affected his health.

415
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.789
What investments?

416
00:21:08.872 --> 00:21:11.875
See here, he isn't going into Morgan's
automobile concern, is he?


417
00:21:11.959 --> 00:21:15.462
Oh, no.
The automobile concern is all Eugene's.


418
00:21:15.545 --> 00:21:17.965
No, your father's rolling mills ‒

419
00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:21.218
Hello, dear.
Have you had trouble sleeping?


420
00:21:21.301 --> 00:21:22.928
Look here, Father.

421
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:25.555
About this man Morgan
and his old sewing machine.


422
00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:29.184
Doesn't he want to get Grandfather to put
some money into it? Isn't that what he's up to?


423
00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:33.271
You little silly.
What on earth are you talking about?


424
00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:37.025
Eugene Morgan's perfectly able to
finance his own inventions these days.


425
00:21:37.109 --> 00:21:39.027
I'll bet he borrows money from Uncle Jack.

426
00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:41.154
Georgie, why do you say such a thing?

427
00:21:41.238 --> 00:21:44.533
Just strikes me as that sort of a man.
Isn't he, Father?


428
00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:47.494
He was a fairly wild young fellow

429
00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:50.872
He's like you in one thing, Georgie.
He spent too much money.


430
00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:54.459
Only he didn't have any mother to get money
out of a grandfather for him.


431
00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:56.586
But I believe he's done fairly well
of late years,


432
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.881
and I doubt if he needs anybody else's money
to back his horseless carriage.


433
00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:01.842
Well, what's he brought
the old thing here for then?


434
00:22:01.925 --> 00:22:04.886
I'm sure I don't know.
You might ask him.


435
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.014
I'll be in to say good night, dear.

436
00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.685
Aunt Fanny.

437
00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:15.313
What in the world's
the matter with you?


438
00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:19.609
I suppose you don't know why Father doesn't want
to go on that horseless carriage trip tomorrow.


439
00:22:19.693 --> 00:22:21.153
What do you mean?

440
00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:23.739
You're his only sister,
and yet you don't know.


441
00:22:24.656 --> 00:22:26.199
Well, he ‒

442
00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:29.327
he never wants to go anywhere
that I ever heard of.


443
00:22:30.287 --> 00:22:32.497
What is the matter with you?

444
00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:35.208
He doesn't want to go
because he doesn't like this man Morgan.


445
00:22:35.292 --> 00:22:37.794
Oh, good gracious!

446
00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:40.547
Eugene Morgan
isn't in your father's thoughts at all,


447
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.715
one way or the other.

448
00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:43.216
- Good night.
- Why should he be?


449
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.301
- Good night.
- Good night.


450
00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:45.343
- Hey.
- You two at it again?


451
00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:48.638
What makes you and everybody
so excited over this man Morgan?


452
00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:50.098
- "This man Morgan."
- Excited?


453
00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:51.933
- Oh, shut up.
- Can't ‒


454
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.063
Can't people be glad
to see an old friend

455
00:22:56.146 --> 00:23:00.067
without silly children like you
having to make a to-do about it?


456
00:23:01.443 --> 00:23:02.527
I ‒

457
00:23:03.195 --> 00:23:05.947
I've just been suggesting to your mother

458
00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:08.325
that she might give
a little dinner for them.


459
00:23:08.408 --> 00:23:09.868
For who?

460
00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:11.661
"For whom," Georgie.

461
00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:13.830
"For whom, Georgie."

462
00:23:16.249 --> 00:23:18.835
For Mr. Morgan and his daughter.

463
00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:23.256
Oh, look here. Don't do that.
Mother mustn't do that.


464
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.258
"Mother mustn't do that."

465
00:23:25.342 --> 00:23:27.219
- Wouldn't look well.
- "Wouldn't look ‒"


466
00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:31.807
See here, Georgie Minafer.

467
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.100
I suggest...

468
00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:37.646
that you just march
straight on into your room!


469
00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:40.649
Sometimes you say things that show
you have a pretty mean little mind.


470
00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:42.859
- What upsets you this much?
- Shut up!


471
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:44.694
I know what you mean!

472
00:23:45.403 --> 00:23:49.324
You're trying to insinuate that I'd get your mother
to invite Eugene Morgan here on my account.


473
00:23:49.407 --> 00:23:51.159
I'm gonna move to a hotel!

474
00:23:51.243 --> 00:23:53.495
- Because he's a widower!
- What?


475
00:23:53.578 --> 00:23:54.913
"What?"

476
00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:01.086
I'm trying to insinuate
that you're setting your cap for him


477
00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:02.671
and getting Mother to help you?

478
00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:04.756
- Oh!
- Is that what you mean?


479
00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:11.304
You attend to your own affairs!

480
00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:13.932
Well. I will be shot.

481
00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:16.226
I <i>will.</i>

482
00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:18.103
I certainly will be shot.

483
00:24:18.186 --> 00:24:19.604
- Oh!
- Oh.


484
00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:31.449
Do you think you'll get it to start?

485
00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.877
What's wrong with it, Gene?

486
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.587
I wish I knew.

487
00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.273
Jack! Push! Not in front of there!

488
00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:05.692
Push here! Come on!

489
00:25:05.775 --> 00:25:07.027
Push!

490
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.820
Get up, Jack! Come on!

491
00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:18.163
Come on! Push! Come on, Jack!

492
00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:21.291
Get a horse. Get a horse!

493
00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:22.834
Get a horse!

494
00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:25.879
Get a horse! Get a horse!

495
00:25:27.964 --> 00:25:29.591
Look out, Lucy!

496
00:25:29.674 --> 00:25:31.885
What's happened to them?
Oh, George!


497
00:25:31.968 --> 00:25:34.012
- Don't get excited, Isabel.
- Lucy!


498
00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:44.981
- Are you all right?
- Georgie!


499
00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:47.859
They're all right, Isabel.
The snow bank's a feather bed.


500
00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:49.945
- Georgie!
- Lucy dear.


501
00:25:50.028 --> 00:25:52.030
- Oh, I'm fine, Papa.
- Nothing's the matter.


502
00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:54.699
- Oh, Georgie!
- They're all right, Isabel.


503
00:25:54.783 --> 00:25:56.785
Are you sure you're not hurt, Lucy dear?

504
00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:58.578
- Georgie.
- Don't make a fuss, Mother.


505
00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:01.539
- George, that terrible fall.
- Please, Mother, please.


506
00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.375
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure, Georgie?


507
00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:05.627
- Sometimes one doesn't realize the shock.
- Oh, Isabel!


508
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.129
You've just got to be sure, dear.

509
00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:10.507
I'm all right, Mother.
Nothing's the matter.


510
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.801
- Let me brush you off, dear.
- Leave me alone.


511
00:26:12.884 --> 00:26:15.345
You look pretty spry, Lucy.
All that snow becomes you.


512
00:26:15.428 --> 00:26:17.931
That's right, it does.

513
00:26:18.014 --> 00:26:19.474
That darned horse.

514
00:26:19.557 --> 00:26:21.476
Pendennis will be home
long before we will.


515
00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.604
All we've got to depend on is Gene Morgan's
broken-down chafing dish yonder.


516
00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:29.985
- She'll go!
- All aboard!


517
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:34.364
- You'll have to sit on my lap, Lucy!
- All right!


518
00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:36.783
Stamp the snow.
You mustn't ride with wet feet.


519
00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:40.287
They're not wet. For goodness sakes, get in.
You're standing in the snow yourself.


520
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.705
Get in, Mother.

521
00:26:41.788 --> 00:26:45.500
You're the same Isabel I used to know.
You're a divinely ridiculous woman.


522
00:26:46.334 --> 00:26:48.962
George, you'll push
if we get started, won't you?


523
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:51.089
Push.

524
00:26:51.172 --> 00:26:54.384
"Divinely" and "ridiculous"
just counterbalance each other, don't they?


525
00:26:54.467 --> 00:26:56.803
Plus one and minus one equal nothing.

526
00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.514
So you mean I'm nothing in particular?

527
00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:02.183
No, that doesn't seem to be
precisely what I meant.


528
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:07.605
What are you doing?

529
00:27:16.865 --> 00:27:18.450
Come on, Georgie! Push!

530
00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:20.118
I'm pushing!

531
00:27:20.994 --> 00:27:23.079
Push harder!

532
00:27:23.163 --> 00:27:25.081
Hooray!

533
00:27:42.974 --> 00:27:44.225
Come on, Georgie! Push!

534
00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:46.436
What do you think I'm doing?

535
00:27:49.314 --> 00:27:53.026
Your father wanted to prove that his
horseless carriage would run even in the snow.


536
00:27:53.109 --> 00:27:55.111
- It really does too.
- Oh.


537
00:27:55.195 --> 00:27:57.155
It's so interesting.

538
00:27:57.238 --> 00:28:02.494
He says he's going to have wheels
all made of rubber and blown up with air.


539
00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:04.371
I should think they'd explode.

540
00:28:04.454 --> 00:28:06.581
But Eugene seems very confident.

541
00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:10.001
It seems so like old
times to hear him talk.

542

George, you tried to swing underneath me
and break the fall for me when we went over.


548
00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:37.487
I knew you were doing that.
It was nice of you.


549
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.990
Wasn't much of a fall to speak of.
How about that kiss?

Wilbur Minafer.

559
00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:20.673
Quiet man.

560
00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:24.052
Town will hardly know he's gone.

561
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.315
Where did Isabel go to?

562
00:30:37.398 --> 00:30:39.192
She was tired.

563
00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:41.528
Never was becoming to her to look pale.

564
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.738
Look out.

565
00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:46.491
Oh, boy. Strawberry shortcake.

566
00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:48.618
It's the first this season.

567
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:50.161
Hope it's big enough.

568
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:53.498
- You must've known I was coming home.
- Mmm.


569
00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:57.001
- What did you say?
- Nothing.


570
00:30:59.837 --> 00:31:01.881
- Mmm.
- Sweet enough?


571
00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:03.174
It's fine.

572
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:10.265
Suppose your mother's been pretty gay
at the commencement.


573
00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:13.560
Going a lot?

574
00:31:13.643 --> 00:31:15.812
How could she, in mourning?

575
00:31:15.895 --> 00:31:19.274
All she could do was sit around and look on.
That's all Lucy could do either, for that matter.


576
00:31:19.357 --> 00:31:21.067
How did Lucy get home?

577
00:31:22.068 --> 00:31:24.445
On the train with the rest of us.

578
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:26.406
Quit bolting your food.

579
00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:38.501
Did you drive out to their house with her
before you came here?


580
00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:41.379
No.

581
00:31:41.462 --> 00:31:43.464
She went home with her father.

582
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:46.676
Oh, I see.

583
00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.054
Don't eat so fast, George!

584
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.643
So, uh...

585
00:31:57.353 --> 00:32:00.064
Eugene came to the station to meet you?

586
00:32:01.649 --> 00:32:02.859
To meet us?

587
00:32:04.569 --> 00:32:05.945
How could he?

588
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.490
I don't know what you mean.

589
00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:14.412
Want some more milk?

590
00:32:14.495 --> 00:32:15.830
No, thanks.

591
00:32:19.334 --> 00:32:22.170
I haven't seen him
while your mother's been away.


592
00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:25.298
Naturally. He's been east himself.

593
00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:28.843
Did you see him?

594
00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:31.721
Naturally, since he made
the trip home with us.


595
00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:34.641
He did? He was
with you all the time?

596
00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:36.476
Uh-uh.

597
00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:39.228
Only on the train,
in the last three days before we left.


598
00:32:39.312 --> 00:32:41.606
Uncle Jack got him to come along.

599
00:32:41.689 --> 00:32:43.650
You're gonna get fat.

600
00:32:43.733 --> 00:32:45.652
I can't help that.

601
00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:47.820
You're such a wonderful housekeeper.

602
00:32:48.905 --> 00:32:50.907
You certainly know how
to make things taste good.


603
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.325
Mmm.

604
00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:55.370
I don't think you'd stay single very long
if some of these bachelors or widowers ‒


605
00:32:55.453 --> 00:32:57.080
It's a little odd.

606
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:02.043
What's odd?

607
00:33:02.126 --> 00:33:05.588
Your mother's not mentioning
that Mr. Morgan had been with you.


608
00:33:05.672 --> 00:33:07.465
Didn't think of it, I suppose.

609
00:33:07.548 --> 00:33:10.426
- But I'll tell you something in confidence.
- What?


610
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.263
Well, it struck me that Mr. Morgan was looking
pretty absent-minded most of the time.


611
00:33:14.347 --> 00:33:16.265
And he certainly is dressing
better than he used to.


612
00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:19.644
Oh, he... he isn't dressing better.
He's dressing up.


613
00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:23.064
Fanny, you oughta be a little encouraging

614
00:33:23.147 --> 00:33:27.276
when a prized bachelor begins
to show by his haberdashery...


615
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.278
what he wants you to think about him.

616
00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:31.280
Jack tells me that the factory's
been doing quite well.


617
00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:32.824
- "Quite well"?
- Honestly, Aunt Fanny ‒


618
00:33:32.907 --> 00:33:34.200
Why, listen, Eugene's got ‒

619
00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:36.202
I shouldn't be a bit surprised
to have him request an interview


620
00:33:36.285 --> 00:33:38.204
and declare that his intentions
are honorable,


621
00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:40.540
and ask my permission
to pay his addresses to you.


622
00:33:40.623 --> 00:33:43.126
What had I better tell him?

623
00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:47.130
- Oh, Aunt Fanny.
- Oh, Fanny, we were only teasing.


624
00:33:47.213 --> 00:33:49.132
- Oh, let me alone!
- Please, Fanny.


625
00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.426
- We didn't mean anything.
- Let go of me! Please!


626
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:54.345
We didn't know you'd got
so sensitive as all this!


627
00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:06.399
It's getting so you can't joke with her
about anything anymore.


628
00:34:07.442 --> 00:34:10.945
It all began when we found out
Father's estate was all washed up


629
00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:13.030
and he didn't leave anything.

630
00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:17.285
I thought she'd feel better
when we turned over his insurance to her.


631
00:34:18.453 --> 00:34:21.664
Gave it to her
absolutely without any strings to it.


632
00:34:21.748 --> 00:34:24.375
But now... I don't know.

633
00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:25.668
Yeah.

634
00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:29.964
Think maybe we've been...

635
00:34:30.757 --> 00:34:32.967
teasing her about the wrong things.

636
00:34:34.927 --> 00:34:37.054
Fanny hasn't got much in her life.

637
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.144
You know, George,
just being an aunt isn't...


638
00:34:43.811 --> 00:34:46.939
really the great career
it may sometimes seem to be.


639
00:34:49.233 --> 00:34:52.236
I really don't know of anything much
Fanny has got.


640
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.072
Except her feeling about Eugene.

641
00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:04.457
We're now turning out
a car and a quarter a day.


642
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.918
- Isn't that marvelous?
- What's marvelous?


643
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:09.253
They're turning out
a car and a quarter a day.


644
00:35:09.337 --> 00:35:12.131
- Oh!
- All this noise ‒ Mother?


645
00:35:12.215 --> 00:35:16.844
Mother, all this noise and smell
seems to be good for you.


646
00:35:16.928 --> 00:35:18.971
I think you oughta come here
every time you get the blues.


647
00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:21.474
Oh, she never gets the blues, George.

648
00:35:21.557 --> 00:35:23.893
I never knew a person
of a more even disposition.


649
00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:26.729
- No, it's this place.
- I wish I could be more like that.


650
00:35:26.813 --> 00:35:31.234
Wouldn't anybody be delighted to see an old
friend take an idea out of the air like that ‒


651
00:35:31.317 --> 00:35:33.903
an idea most people
laughed at him for ‒

652
00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:37.657
and turn it to such
a splendid humming thing as this factory.


653
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.200
Do you remember this?

654
00:35:40.284 --> 00:35:42.161
Our first machine.

655
00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:44.288
The original Morgan Invincible.

656
00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:46.374
I remember.

657
00:35:46.457 --> 00:35:48.042
How quaint.

658
00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:51.003
Of course I'm happy.
So very, very happy.


659
00:35:51.087 --> 00:35:53.381
Just look at the Morgan now,
Mrs. Minafer.


660
00:35:53.464 --> 00:35:55.216
It's beautiful.

661
00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:56.968
Just beautiful.

662
00:35:57.677 --> 00:36:00.096
- Did you ever see anything so lovely?
- As what?


663
00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:02.932
As your mother. 
She's a darling.

664
00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:07.353
And Papa looks as if he were going to
either explode or to utter loud sobs.


665
00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:08.980
It's just glorious.

666
00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:12.275
It makes us all happy, Eugene.

667
00:36:12.358 --> 00:36:13.985
Give him your hand, Fanny.

668
00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:16.153
There.

669
00:36:16.237 --> 00:36:19.907
If brother Jack were here, Eugene would
have his three oldest and best friends


670
00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:22.410
congratulating him all at once.

671
00:36:22.493 --> 00:36:24.829
We know what brother Jack
thinks about it though.


672
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.250
I used to write verse
about 20 years ago.


673
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:31.919
- Remember that?
- I remember that too.


674
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.298
I'm almost thinking I could do it again...

675
00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:40.136
to thank you for making a factory visit
into such a kind celebration.


676
00:36:49.061 --> 00:36:50.438
Isabel, dear.

677
00:36:51.355 --> 00:36:53.065
Yes, Eugene?

678
00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:55.151
Don't you think you should tell George?

679
00:36:56.193 --> 00:36:58.070
- About us?
- Yes.


680
00:37:00.823 --> 00:37:02.742
There's still time.

681
00:37:02.825 --> 00:37:04.827
I think he should hear it from you.

682
00:37:06.954 --> 00:37:08.414
He will, dearest.

683
00:37:10.416 --> 00:37:12.043
Soon.

684
00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:15.796
Soon.

685
00:37:24.972 --> 00:37:27.975
I'll still take a horse any day.

686
00:37:33.606 --> 00:37:35.566
- Whoa.
- Oh, don't.


687
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.361
Why? Do you want him
to trot his legs off?


688
00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:40.488
- No, but ‒
- "No, but" what?


689
00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:44.742
I know when you make him walk, it's so you can
give all your attention to proposing to me again.


690
00:37:44.825 --> 00:37:47.662
- George, do let Pendennis trot again.
- I won't.


691
00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:50.831
Get up, Pendennis.
Go on, trot. Commence.


692
00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:55.044
Lucy, if you aren't
the prettiest thing in this world.


693
00:37:55.127 --> 00:37:57.505
When are you going to say
we're really engaged?


694
00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:01.634
Not for years. 
So there's the answer.

695
00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:04.220
Lucy.

696
00:38:04.303 --> 00:38:06.263
Dear, what's the matter?

697
00:38:06.347 --> 00:38:09.100
You look as if you're going to cry.

698
00:38:09.183 --> 00:38:12.770
You always do that whenever I can
get you to talk about marrying me.


699
00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:16.065
- I know it.
- Well, why do you?


700
00:38:16.148 --> 00:38:19.819
One reason's because
I have a feeling it's never going to be.


701
00:38:19.902 --> 00:38:22.530
- You haven't any reason or ‒
- It's just a feeling.


702
00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:25.366
I don't know.

703
00:38:25.449 --> 00:38:27.493
Everything's so unsettled.

704
00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:31.330
If you aren't the queerest girl.
What's unsettled?


705
00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:35.126
Well, for one thing, George,
you haven't decided on anything to do yet.


706
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.545
Or at least if you have,
you've never spoken of it.


707
00:38:37.628 --> 00:38:40.172
Lucy, haven't you
perfectly well understood


708
00:38:40.256 --> 00:38:43.551
that I don't intend to go into a business
or adopt a profession?


709
00:38:43.634 --> 00:38:45.970
Well, what are you going to do, George?

710
00:38:46.053 --> 00:38:49.223
Why, I expect to lead an honorable life.

711
00:38:49.306 --> 00:38:51.475
I expect to contribute my share to charities

712
00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:54.520
and to take part
in ‒ well, in movements.

713
00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:57.064
- What kind?
- Whatever appeals to me.


714
00:38:58.107 --> 00:39:01.027
I should like to revert to the questions
I was asking you, if you don't mind.


715
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.154
- No, George. I think we'd better ‒
- Your father's a businessman.


716
00:39:03.237 --> 00:39:05.531
He's a mechanical genius.
Of course, he's both.


717
00:39:05.614 --> 00:39:07.908
Isn't it your father's idea
that I ought to go into business


718
00:39:07.992 --> 00:39:09.910
and you oughtn't to be
engaged to me until I do?


719
00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:12.872
No. I've never once
spoken to him about it.


720
00:39:12.955 --> 00:39:15.207
But you know that's the way
he does feel about it.


721
00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:16.917
Yes.

722
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:18.919
Do you think that I'd be
very much of a man


723
00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:21.464
if I let another man dictate to me
my own way of life?


724
00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:23.799
George.
Who's dictating your way of life?


725
00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:27.303
I don't believe in the whole world
scrubbing dishes,


726
00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:30.473
selling potatoes, or trying law cases.

727
00:39:32.016 --> 00:39:36.187
No, I daresay I don't care any more
for your father's ideals than he does for mine.


728
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.355
- George.
- Giddap, Pendennis.


729
00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:44.904
Well, seems to have recovered.

730
00:39:44.987 --> 00:39:47.114
Looks in the highest good spirits.

731
00:39:47.198 --> 00:39:49.366
- I beg pardon?
- Your grandson.


732
00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:52.953
Last night he seemed inclined to melancholy.

733
00:39:53.037 --> 00:39:54.330
What about?

734
00:39:55.998 --> 00:39:59.919
Not getting remorseful about
all the money he spent in college, is he?


735
00:40:01.253 --> 00:40:03.672
I wonder what he thinks I'm made of.

736
00:40:03.756 --> 00:40:05.341
Gold.

737
00:40:05.424 --> 00:40:08.761
- And he's right about that part of you, Father.
- What part?


738
00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:10.262
Your heart.

739
00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:16.602
I suppose that may account for
how heavy it feels nowadays sometimes.


740
00:40:18.729 --> 00:40:23.526
This town seems to be rolling right over
that old heart you mentioned just now, Jack.


741
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.196
Rolling over it and burying it under.

742
00:40:34.036 --> 00:40:35.788
I miss my best girl.

743
00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:40.209
We all do. Lucy's on a visit, Father.
She's spending a week with a school friend.


744
00:40:40.292 --> 00:40:41.836
- She'll be back Monday.
- Ah.


745
00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:45.506
George, how does it happen
you didn't tell us before?


746
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:48.300
He never said a word to us
about Lucy's going away.


747
00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:49.510
Probably afraid to.

748
00:40:49.593 --> 00:40:52.930
Didn't know that what he might break down
and cry if he tried to speak of it.


749
00:40:53.013 --> 00:40:55.307
Isn't that so, Georgie?

750
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:58.060
- Or didn't Lucy tell you she was going?
- She told me.


751
00:40:58.144 --> 00:41:00.312
At any rate, Georgie didn't approve.

752
00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:03.816
I suppose you two aren't speaking again?

753
00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:07.570
Gene, what's this I hear about someone else
opening up a horseless carriage shop,


754
00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:09.196
somewhere out in the suburbs?

755
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.615
Well, I suppose
they'll drive you out of business.


756
00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:16.120
Or else the two of you'll get together
and drive all the rest of us off of the streets.


757
00:41:16.203 --> 00:41:19.415
Well, we'll even things up
by making the streets bigger.


758
00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:22.543
Automobiles will carry our streets
clear out to the county line.


759
00:41:22.626 --> 00:41:25.588
Well, I hope you're wrong,
because if people go to moving that far,


760
00:41:25.671 --> 00:41:28.841
real estate values here
in the old residence part of town


761
00:41:28.924 --> 00:41:30.551
will be stretched pretty thin.

762
00:41:30.634 --> 00:41:34.305
So your devilish machines
are going to ruin all your old friends, eh, Gene?


763
00:41:34.388 --> 00:41:37.850
You really think they're going
to change the face of the land?


764
00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:40.811
They're already doing it, Major,
and it can't be stopped.


765
00:41:40.895 --> 00:41:43.564
- Automobiles are ‒
- Automobiles are a useless nuisance.


766
00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:49.069
What did you say, George?

767
00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:51.405
I said automobiles
are a useless nuisance.


768
00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:54.700
Never amount to anything but a nuisance,
and they had no business to be invented.


769
00:41:54.783 --> 00:41:57.703
Of course you forget
Mr. Morgan makes them.


770
00:41:57.786 --> 00:42:00.122
Also did his share in inventing them.

771
00:42:00.206 --> 00:42:04.210
If you weren't so thoughtless,
he might think you rather offensive.


772
00:42:07.004 --> 00:42:09.882
I'm not sure George is wrong
about automobiles.


773
00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:16.013
With all their speed forward,
they may be a step backward in civilization.


774
00:42:17.806 --> 00:42:22.353
It may be that they won't add to the beauty
of the world or the life of men's souls.


775
00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:24.480
I'm not sure.

776
00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:27.274
But automobiles have come.

777
00:42:28.692 --> 00:42:32.821
And almost all outward things are going
to be different because of what they bring.


778
00:42:34.448 --> 00:42:37.701
They're going to alter war
and they're going to alter peace.


779
00:42:39.161 --> 00:42:43.832
And I think men's minds are going to be changed
in subtle ways because of automobiles.


780
00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:47.044
And it may be that George is right.

781
00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:52.424
It may be that
in ten or 20 years from now,


782
00:42:52.508 --> 00:42:55.886
if we can see the inward
change in men by that time...


783
00:42:57.054 --> 00:42:59.139
I shouldn't be able to defend
the gasoline engine,


784
00:42:59.223 --> 00:43:01.225
but would have to agree with George...

785
00:43:02.226 --> 00:43:05.646
that automobiles had no business
to be invented.


786
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:14.196
Well, Major, if you'll excuse me.

787
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.114
Fanny.

788
00:43:15.197 --> 00:43:17.074
- Oh, Eugene, ple ‒
- Isabel.


789
00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:19.326
Got to run down to the shop
and speak to the foreman.


790
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.329
- I'll see you to the door.
- Don't bother, sir. I know the way.


791
00:43:22.413 --> 00:43:23.872
I'll come too.

792
00:43:41.682 --> 00:43:43.600
Georgie dear, what did you mean?

793
00:43:43.684 --> 00:43:45.311
Just what I said.

794
00:43:46.603 --> 00:43:49.982
- He was hurt.
- I don't see why he should be.


795
00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:52.318
I didn't say anything about him.

796
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:55.779
Didn't seem to me to be hurt.
He seemed perfectly cheerful.


797
00:43:55.863 --> 00:43:58.365
What made you think he was hurt?

798
00:43:58.449 --> 00:43:59.867
I know him.

799
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.879
By Jove, Georgie, you are a puzzle.

800
00:44:11.962 --> 00:44:13.505
In what way, may I ask?

801
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:16.091
Well, it's a new style
of courting a pretty girl, I must say,


802
00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:18.427
for a young fellow
to go deliberately out of his way


803
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.389
to try and make an enemy of her father
by attacking his business.


804
00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:24.433
By Jove!

805
00:44:24.516 --> 00:44:26.643
It's a new way of winning a woman.

806
00:44:34.735 --> 00:44:35.903
George.

807
00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:38.739
You struck just the right treatment to adopt.
You're doing just the right thing.


808
00:44:38.822 --> 00:44:39.823
Oh, what do you want?

809
00:44:39.907 --> 00:44:41.825
Your father would thank you
if he could see what you're doing.


810
00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:44.203
Quit the mysterious detective business.
You make me dizzy.


811
00:44:44.286 --> 00:44:46.580
You don't care to hear
that I approve of what you're doing?


812
00:44:46.663 --> 00:44:48.707
For the gosh sakes,
what in the world is wrong with you?


813
00:44:48.791 --> 00:44:52.378
Oh, you're always picking on me, always,
ever since you were a little boy.


814
00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:53.337
Oh, my gosh.

815
00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.090
You wouldn't treat anybody in the world
like this except old Fanny.


816
00:44:56.173 --> 00:44:59.093
"Old Fanny," you'd say,
"It's nobody but old Fanny, so I'll kick her.


817
00:44:59.176 --> 00:45:01.845
Nobody'll resent it.
I'll kick her all I want to."


818
00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:05.099
And you're right. I haven't got anything
in the world since my brother died.


819
00:45:05.182 --> 00:45:06.642
- Nobody, nothing.
- Oh, my gosh.


820
00:45:06.725 --> 00:45:08.644
I never, never in the world
would have told you about it,


821
00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:10.479
or even made the faintest reference to it

822
00:45:10.562 --> 00:45:12.314
if I hadn't seen
that somebody else had told you,


823
00:45:12.398 --> 00:45:14.108
or you found out
for yourself in some way.

824
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:17.945
- Somebody else had told me what?
- How people are talking about your mother.


825
00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:26.328
What did you say?

826
00:45:26.412 --> 00:45:29.957
Of course, I understood what you were doing
when you started being rude to Eugene.


827
00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.502
I knew you'd give Lucy up in a minute if it came
to a question of your mother's reputation.


828
00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:34.795
- Look here ‒
- Because you said ‒


829
00:45:34.878 --> 00:45:36.630
Look here! Just what do you mean?

830
00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:40.843
I only wanted to say
that I'm sorry for you, George, that's all.


831
00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:44.721
But it's only old Fanny,
so whatever she says, pick on her for it.


832
00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:46.932
- Hammer her! Hammer her!
- Jack said ‒


833
00:45:47.015 --> 00:45:49.017
It's only poor old, lonely Fanny!

834
00:45:49.101 --> 00:45:51.520
Uncle Jack said if there was any gossip,
it was about you!


835
00:45:51.603 --> 00:45:54.440
He said people might be laughing about the way
you ran after Morgan, but that was all!


836
00:45:54.523 --> 00:45:58.610
Oh, yes, it's always Fanny!
Ridiculous old Fanny. Always! Always!


837
00:45:58.694 --> 00:46:02.823
Listen! You said Mother let him come here
just on your account, and now you say ‒


838
00:46:02.906 --> 00:46:04.241
He did.

839
00:46:04.324 --> 00:46:06.160
Anyhow, he liked to dance with me.

840
00:46:06.243 --> 00:46:08.078
He danced with me
as much as he did with her.


841
00:46:08.162 --> 00:46:10.581
You told me Mother never saw him
except when she was chaperoning you.


842
00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:13.459
Well, you don't suppose
that stops people from talking, do you?


843
00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:16.670
They just thought I didn't count.

844
00:46:16.753 --> 00:46:19.047
"It's only Fanny Minafer,"
I suppose they'd say.


845
00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.551
Besides, everybody knew
he'd been engaged to her.


846
00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:24.219
- What's that?
- Everybody knows it.


847
00:46:24.303 --> 00:46:27.973
Everybody in this town knows that Isabel
never really cared for any other man in her life.


848
00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:30.100
I believe I'm going crazy.

849
00:46:30.184 --> 00:46:32.352
You mean you lied
when you told me there wasn't any talk?


850
00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:34.438
It never would have amounted
to anything if Wilbur had lived.


851
00:46:34.521 --> 00:46:36.607
You mean Morgan might have married you?

852
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.317
No.

853
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.235
Because I don't know
that I'd have accepted him.


854
00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:43.530
Are you trying to tell me that because
he comes here and they see her with him,


855
00:46:43.614 --> 00:46:45.324
driving and all that,

856
00:46:45.407 --> 00:46:48.202
they think that they were right
in saying that she was ‒


857
00:46:48.285 --> 00:46:50.537
she was in love with him before ‒

858
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.623
before my father died?

859
00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:54.333
Why, George.

860
00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:56.835
Don't you know that's what they say?

861
00:46:56.919 --> 00:46:58.921
You must know that everybody in town ‒

862
00:46:59.004 --> 00:47:00.547
- Who told you?
- What?


863
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:02.466
Who told you there was talk?
Where is this talk?


864
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:03.842
Where does it come from? Who does it?

865
00:47:03.926 --> 00:47:06.178
Why, I suppose pretty much everybody I know.
It's pretty general.


866
00:47:06.261 --> 00:47:07.304
- Who said so?
- What?


867
00:47:07.387 --> 00:47:10.307
- How did you get hold of it? You answer me!
- I hardly think it would be fair to give names.


868
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.936
Look here, one of your best friends is that
mother of Charlie Johnson's across the way.


869
00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:16.271
- Has she ever mentioned this to you?
- Well, she may have intimated it.


870
00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:17.856
You and she have been talking about it.
Do you deny it?


871
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.316
- Why, George ‒
- Do you deny it?


872
00:47:19.399 --> 00:47:22.277
She's a very kind, discreet woman, George,
but she may have intimated ‒


873
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:23.779
George!

874
00:47:25.405 --> 00:47:27.241
What are you going to do, George?

875
00:47:28.659 --> 00:47:30.827
Mr. Amberson.

876
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:32.829
I mean Mr. Minafer.

877
00:47:32.913 --> 00:47:34.706
- Won't you come in, please.
- Thank you.


878
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:38.418
Well! How nice to see you, Mr. Minafer.

879
00:47:38.502 --> 00:47:40.003
Mrs. Johnson?

880
00:47:43.048 --> 00:47:46.051
Mrs. Johnson,
I have come to ask you a few questions.


881
00:47:46.134 --> 00:47:48.762
Certainly, Mr. Minafer.
Anything I can do for you.


882
00:47:48.845 --> 00:47:52.015
I don't mean to waste any time,
Mrs. Johnson.


883
00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:56.937
You ‒ You were talking about a ‒
a scandal that involved my mother's name.


884
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.814
Mr. Minafer!

885
00:47:58.897 --> 00:48:01.733
My aunt told me
you repeated this scandal to her.


886
00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:05.153
I don't think your
aunt can have said that.

887
00:48:05.237 --> 00:48:09.074
We may have discussed some few matters
that have been a topic of comment about town.


888
00:48:09.157 --> 00:48:11.034
Yes, I think you may have.

889
00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:13.078
Other people may be less considerate.

890
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:14.997
Other people?
That's what I want to know about.


891
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.583
These other people. How many? How many?

892
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:19.501
- What?
- How many other people talk about it?


893
00:48:19.585 --> 00:48:22.087
Really, this isn't a courtroom.

894
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.590
And I'm not a
defendant in a libel suit.

895
00:48:24.673 --> 00:48:25.841
You may be.

896
00:48:25.924 --> 00:48:27.593
I want to know
just who's dared to say these things


897
00:48:27.676 --> 00:48:29.845
if I have to force my way
into every house in town.


898
00:48:29.928 --> 00:48:32.431
- I mean to know just who told you these ‒
- You mean to know!


899
00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:34.933
Well, you'll know something pretty quick.

900
00:48:35.017 --> 00:48:37.394
You'll know that you're out in the street.

901
00:48:37.477 --> 00:48:39.646
Please to leave my house!

902
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:50.032
Oh! Now you have done it.

903
00:48:50.115 --> 00:48:52.117
What have I done
that wasn't honorable and right?


904
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.287
You think these riffraff can go around town
bandying my mother's good name?


905
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.788
They can now!

906
00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:59.708
Georgie, gossip's never fatal till it's denied.

907
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:01.793
Well, if you think I'm gonna let
my mother's good name be ‒


908
00:49:01.877 --> 00:49:05.297
Good name!
Nobody has a good name in a bad mouth!


909
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.924
Nobody has a good name
in a silly mouth either.


910
00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:11.678
Didn't you understand me when I told you people
are saying my mother means to marry this man?


911
00:49:11.762 --> 00:49:14.723
- Yes, yes, I understood you.
- Great gosh! You speak of it so calmly!


912
00:49:14.806 --> 00:49:16.850
- Why shouldn't they marry if they want to?
- Why shouldn't they?


913
00:49:16.933 --> 00:49:18.268
- It's their own affair.
- Why shouldn't they?


914
00:49:18.352 --> 00:49:22.522
- Yes! Why shouldn't they?
- That you can sit there and speak of it!


915
00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:25.859
- Your own sister.
- Oh, for heaven's sake, don't be so theatrical.


916
00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:27.986
Come back here!

917
00:49:53.637 --> 00:49:57.349
Needn't mind, Mary.
I'll see who it is and what they want.


918
00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:59.518
Probably it's only a peddler.

919
00:49:59.601 --> 00:50:01.144
Thank you, Mr. George.

920
00:50:12.155 --> 00:50:14.157
Good afternoon, George.

921
00:50:14.241 --> 00:50:16.868
Your mother expects to go driving with me,
I believe.


922
00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:20.080
If you'll be so kind
as to send her word I'm here.


923
00:50:20.163 --> 00:50:21.164
No.

924
00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:24.710
- I beg your pardon. I said ‒
- I heard you.


925
00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:27.796
You said you had an engagement
with my mother, and I said no.


926
00:50:28.714 --> 00:50:29.965
What's the matter?

927
00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:33.552
My mother will have no interest
in knowing that you came here today.


928
00:50:33.635 --> 00:50:35.762
- Or any other day.
- I'm afraid I don't understand you.


929
00:50:35.846 --> 00:50:39.725
I doubt if I can make it much plainer,
but I'll try.


930
00:50:39.808 --> 00:50:41.476
You're not wanted in this house, Mr. Morgan.

931
00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:45.397
Now or at any other time.
Perhaps you'll understand this.


932
00:51:27.647 --> 00:51:29.900
- Isabel?
- Yes.


933
00:51:29.983 --> 00:51:31.985
I've just come from Eugene.

934
00:51:33.487 --> 00:51:35.405
Yes?

935
00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:37.324
I want to talk to you.

936
00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:48.668
Well!

937
00:51:51.296 --> 00:51:53.673
I can just guess what that was about.

938
00:52:08.188 --> 00:52:10.899
- He's telling her what you did to Eugene.
- You go back to your room.


939
00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:13.318
- You're not going in there!
- You go back to your room.


940
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:15.612
George! George!

941
00:52:15.695 --> 00:52:18.406
No, you don't, Georgie Minafer!
You'll keep away from there!


942
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.534
- You let go of me!
- I won't! Let them alone!


943
00:52:20.617 --> 00:52:23.119
- Stop taking ahold of me!
- Hush up. Hush up.


944
00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:25.872
Go onto the top
of the stairs! Go on!

945
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.133
It's indecent!

946
00:52:37.217 --> 00:52:39.928
Like squabbling outside the door
of an operating room.


947
00:52:41.388 --> 00:52:43.765
The idea of you going in there now.

948
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:46.184
Jack's telling Isabel the whole thing.

949
00:52:46.268 --> 00:52:48.270
Now you stay here
and let him tell her.

950
00:52:48.353 --> 00:52:50.730
- He's got some consideration for her.
- I suppose you think I haven't.


951
00:52:50.814 --> 00:52:53.233
- You, considerate of anybody?
- I'm considerate of her good name.


952
00:52:53.316 --> 00:52:54.985
- Ah!
- Look here.


953
00:52:55.068 --> 00:52:56.903
Seems to me you're taking
a pretty different tack.


954
00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:59.322
I thought you already knew
everything I did.


955
00:52:59.406 --> 00:53:03.159
I was just suffering,
so I wanted to let out a little.


956
00:53:03.243 --> 00:53:05.579
Oh, I was a fool!

957
00:53:05.662 --> 00:53:09.583
Eugene never would have looked at me,
even if he had never seen Isabel.


958
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:12.210
And they haven't done any harm!

959
00:53:12.294 --> 00:53:14.838
She made Wilbur happy.

960
00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:17.966
She was a true wife to him,
as long as he lived.


961
00:53:18.925 --> 00:53:22.929
But here I go,
not doing myself a bit of good by...


962
00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:24.514
just ruining them.

963
00:53:24.598 --> 00:53:27.392
You told me how all the riffraff in town
were busy with her name,


964
00:53:27.475 --> 00:53:29.728
and the minute I lift my hand to protect her,
you attack me and ‒


965
00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:32.689
Shh! Your uncle's leaving.

966
00:53:32.772 --> 00:53:34.399
I'll be back, Isabel.

967
00:53:34.482 --> 00:53:36.651
George. Let her alone.

968
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:38.862
She's down there by herself.
Don't go down.


969
00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:44.743
Let her alone!

970
00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:19.110
<i>Dearest one,</i>

971
00:54:19.194 --> 00:54:23.114
<i>Yesterday I thought the time had come
when I could ask you to marry me.</i>


972
00:54:23.198 --> 00:54:27.327
<i>And you were dear enough to tell me,
sometime it might come to that.</i>


973
00:54:28.161 --> 00:54:32.332
<i>But now we are faced not with slander</i>

974
00:54:32.415 --> 00:54:36.252
<i>and not with our own fear of it,
because we haven't any,</i>


975
00:54:36.336 --> 00:54:38.922
<i>but someone else's fear of it</i> ‒

976
00:54:39.005 --> 00:54:41.216
<i>your son's.</i>

977
00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:44.844
<i>Oh, dearest woman in the world,
I know what your son is to you,</i>


978
00:54:44.928 --> 00:54:47.263
<i>and it frightens me.</i>

979
00:54:47.347 --> 00:54:49.641
<i>Let me explain a little.</i>

980
00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:52.018
<i>I don't think he'll change.</i>

981
00:54:52.102 --> 00:54:58.441
<i>At 21 or 22, so many things appear
solid and permanent and terrible,</i>


982
00:54:58.525 --> 00:55:02.028
<i>which 40 sees
are nothing but disappearing miasma.</i>


983
00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:05.991
<i>Forty can't tell 20 about this.</i>

984
00:55:06.074 --> 00:55:09.244
<i>Twenty can find out
only by getting to be 40.</i>


985
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.206
<i>And so we come to this, dear</i> ‒

986
00:55:13.289 --> 00:55:16.209
<i>Will you live your life your way,</i>

987
00:55:16.292 --> 00:55:17.877
<i>or George's way?</i>

988
00:55:19.212 --> 00:55:21.506
<i>Dear, it breaks my heart for you,</i>

989
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:23.591
<i>but what you have to oppose now</i>

990
00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:28.263
<i>is the history of your own selfless
and perfect motherhood.</i>


991
00:55:29.347 --> 00:55:31.599
<i>Are you strong enough, Isabel?</i>

992
00:55:31.683 --> 00:55:33.685
<i>Can you make a fight?</i>

993
00:55:46.239 --> 00:55:48.616
<i>I promise you
that if you will take heart for it,</i>


994
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.911
<i>you will find so quickly
that it's all amounted to nothing.</i>


995
00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:56.958
<i>You shall have happiness,
and only happiness.</i>


996
00:55:58.626 --> 00:56:01.087
<i>I'm saying too much for wisdom, I fear.</i>

997
00:56:02.464 --> 00:56:05.341
<i>But, oh, my dear, won't you be strong?</i>

998
00:56:05.425 --> 00:56:08.470
<i>Such a little short strength
it would need.</i>


999
00:56:15.143 --> 00:56:17.771
<i>Don't strike my life down twice, dear.</i>

1000
00:56:19.022 --> 00:56:21.232
<i>This time I've not deserved it.</i>

1001
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.880
Come in.

1002
00:56:55.391 --> 00:56:57.560
Did you read it, dear?

1003
00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:00.396
Yes, I did.

1004
00:57:03.274 --> 00:57:04.776
All of it?

1005
00:57:08.571 --> 00:57:10.073
Yes.

1006
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.288
Well, what do you think, Georgie?

1007
00:57:18.832 --> 00:57:22.877
- What do you mean?
- You can see how fair he means to be.


1008
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:24.462
Fair?

1009
00:57:26.172 --> 00:57:28.800
Fair when he says that he and you
don't care what people say?


1010
00:57:28.883 --> 00:57:30.885
What people say?

1011
00:57:32.303 --> 00:57:35.223
- That Eugene loves me?
- He's always loved you.


1012
00:57:42.647 --> 00:57:44.232
That's true, Georgie.

1013
00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:48.403
But you're my mother.

1014
00:57:48.486 --> 00:57:50.655
You're an Amberson.

1015
00:57:50.738 --> 00:57:52.157
You just ‒

1016
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.534
Yes, dear?

1017
00:58:07.046 --> 00:58:09.007
I don't know, Mother.

1018
00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:31.321
I'll write Eugene.

1019
00:58:34.324 --> 00:58:36.159
He'll understand.

1020
00:58:36.951 --> 00:58:38.453
He'll wait.

1021
00:58:40.788 --> 00:58:42.540
Be better this way.

1022
00:58:46.878 --> 00:58:49.589
We'll go away for
a while, you and I.

1023
00:58:54.928 --> 00:58:55.929
Hello.

1024
00:59:01.684 --> 00:59:03.728
Lucy, you ‒

1025
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.481
- Haven't you ‒
- Haven't I what?


1026
00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:08.524
Nothing.

1027
00:59:08.608 --> 00:59:11.444
- May I walk with you a little ways?
- Yes, indeed.


1028
00:59:21.663 --> 00:59:24.958
- I want to talk to you, Lucy.
- Hope it's about something nice.


1029
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:28.002
Papa's been so glum today,
he's scarcely spoken to me.


1030
00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:30.088
- Well, it's ‒
- Is it a funny story?


1031
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:32.298
May seem like one to you.

1032
00:59:32.382 --> 00:59:34.384
Just to begin with,

1033
00:59:34.467 --> 00:59:36.469
when you went away,
you didn't let me know.


1034
00:59:36.552 --> 00:59:39.847
- Not a word. Not even a line.
- Why, no!


1035
00:59:39.931 --> 00:59:42.225
I just trotted off for some visits.

1036
00:59:42.308 --> 00:59:44.310
- At least you might have done something.
- Why, no, George.


1037
00:59:44.394 --> 00:59:46.521
Don't you remember? 
We'd had a quarrel.

1038
00:59:46.604 --> 00:59:50.108
We didn't speak to each other
all the way home from a long, long drive.


1039
00:59:50.191 --> 00:59:52.819
And since we couldn't play together
like good children,


1040
00:59:52.902 --> 00:59:55.822
of course it was plain
that we oughtn't to play at all.


1041
00:59:55.905 --> 00:59:57.198
Play?

1042
00:59:57.282 --> 01:00:01.411
What I mean is, we'd come to the point
where it was time to quit playing,


1043
01:00:01.494 --> 01:00:04.747
well, what we were playing.

1044
01:00:04.831 --> 01:00:06.624
At being lovers you mean, don't you?

1045
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.876
Something like that. 
It was absurd.

1046
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.753
Didn't have to be absurd.

1047
01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:12.338
No, it couldn't help but be.

1048
01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:16.592
The way I am, and the way you are,
it wouldn't ever be anything else.


1049
01:00:16.676 --> 01:00:19.095
This time, I'm going away.

1050
01:00:19.178 --> 01:00:21.723
That's what I wanted to tell you, Lucy.

1051
01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:25.059
I'm going away tomorrow night,
indefinitely.


1052
01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:28.062
I hope you have ever so nice a time,
George.


1053
01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:30.898
I don't expect
to have a particularly nice time.


1054
01:00:30.982 --> 01:00:33.735
Well then, if I were you, 
I don't think I'd go.

1055
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:38.114
This is our last walk together, Lucy.

1056
01:00:38.197 --> 01:00:41.451
Evidently,
if you're going away tomorrow night.


1057
01:00:41.534 --> 01:00:44.412
This is the last
time I'll see you, ever.

1058
01:00:45.413 --> 01:00:46.914
Ever in my life.

1059
01:00:48.249 --> 01:00:51.836
Mother and I are starting on a trip
around the world tomorrow,


1060
01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:54.088
and we've made no plans at all
for coming back.


1061
01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:56.174
My, that does sound like a long trip.

1062
01:00:56.257 --> 01:00:59.886
Do you plan to be traveling all the time, or will
you stay in one place for the greater part of it?


1063
01:00:59.969 --> 01:01:02.680
- I think it would be lovely to ‒
- Lucy!


1064
01:01:02.764 --> 01:01:05.266
I can't stand this.

1065
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.310
I'm just about ready
to go in that drugstore there


1066
01:01:07.393 --> 01:01:10.396
and ask the clerk to give me something
to keep me from dying in my tracks.


1067
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.648
- It's quite a shock, Lucy.
- What is?


1068
01:01:12.732 --> 01:01:15.651
To find out just how deeply you care.

1069
01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:17.820
To see how much difference
this makes to you.


1070
01:01:17.904 --> 01:01:21.199
- George!
- I can't stand this any longer!


1071
01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:22.784
I can't, Lucy.

1072
01:01:26.746 --> 01:01:28.247
Good-bye, Lucy.

1073
01:01:31.376 --> 01:01:32.877
It's good-bye.

1074
01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:45.973
- I think it's good-bye for good, Lucy.
- Good-bye, George.


1075
01:01:46.057 --> 01:01:48.351
I do hope you
have the most splendid trip.

1076
01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:52.355
Give my love to your mother.

1077
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.791
May I please have a few drops
of aromatic spirits of ammonia


1078
01:02:11.874 --> 01:02:13.835
and a glass of water?

1079
01:02:20.216 --> 01:02:22.051
For gosh sake, miss!

1080
01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:32.019
It's mighty nice of you, Lucy.

1081
01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:35.857
You and Eugene to have me over
to your new house my first day back.


1082
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.818
You'll probably find the old town
rather dull after Paris.


1083
01:02:43.614 --> 01:02:47.618
I found Isabel as well as usual.

1084
01:02:50.204 --> 01:02:55.418
Only I'm afraid "as usual"
isn't particularly well.


1085
01:02:58.045 --> 01:03:00.506
Struck me Isabel
oughta be in a wheelchair.


1086
01:03:01.883 --> 01:03:04.469
What do you mean by that?

1087
01:03:04.552 --> 01:03:06.554
Oh, she's cheerful enough.

1088
01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:09.974
At least... she manages to seem so.

1089
01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:14.061
She's pretty short of breath.

1090
01:03:15.771 --> 01:03:18.232
Father's been that way for years,
of course, but...


1091
01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:22.195
never nearly so much as Isabel is now.

1092
01:03:24.197 --> 01:03:26.949
I told her I thought she oughta
make Georgie let her come home.


1093
01:03:27.033 --> 01:03:29.035
"Let her"?

1094
01:03:29.118 --> 01:03:31.037
Does she want to?

1095
01:03:32.038 --> 01:03:33.789
She doesn't urge it.

1096
01:03:35.374 --> 01:03:39.462
George seems to like the life there
in his grand, gloomy, and peculiar way.


1097
01:03:41.964 --> 01:03:44.759
She'll never change
about being proud of him and all that.


1098
01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:48.346
He's quite a swell.

1099
01:03:49.639 --> 01:03:51.474
She does want to come.

1100
01:03:53.559 --> 01:03:56.229
She'd like to be with Father,
of course, and I think she's ‒


1101
01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:00.608
Well...

1102
01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:04.570
she intimated one day that she
was afraid it might even happen


1103
01:04:04.654 --> 01:04:06.656
she wouldn't get to see him again.

1104
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.411
Think she was really thinking
of her own state of health.


1105
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.456
I see.

1106
01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:20.169
And you say he
won't let her come home?

1107
01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:25.007
Well, uh, I don't think he uses force.

1108
01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:28.553
He's very gentle with her.

1109
01:04:29.804 --> 01:04:32.348
Doubt if the subject
is mentioned between them, yet ‒


1110
01:04:34.684 --> 01:04:37.186
Yet knowing my interesting nephew
as you do...


1111
01:04:39.105 --> 01:04:41.857
wouldn't you think
that was about the way to put it?


1112
01:04:44.193 --> 01:04:47.113
Knowing him as I do, yes.

1113
01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:08.676
Changed.

1114
01:05:10.469 --> 01:05:12.430
So changed.

1115
01:05:12.513 --> 01:05:15.516
You mean ‒ You mean the town?

1116
01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:19.020
You mean the old place is changed,
don't you, dear?


1117
01:05:19.103 --> 01:05:20.104
Yes.

1118
01:05:20.187 --> 01:05:23.441
It'll change to a happier place, old dear,
now that you're back in it.


1119
01:05:23.524 --> 01:05:25.735
You're going to get well again.

1120
01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:31.490
Mr. George will be right down, Mr. Morgan.

1121
01:05:31.574 --> 01:05:32.908
Thank you.

1122
01:05:56.724 --> 01:05:59.393
I've come to see your mother, George.

1123
01:06:00.353 --> 01:06:01.729
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

1124
01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:09.862
Not this time, George.
I'm going up to see her.


1125
01:06:09.945 --> 01:06:14.325
The doctor said that...
she had to be kept quiet.


1126
01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:18.037
I'll be quiet.

1127
01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:25.544
I don't think you should right now.

1128
01:06:27.296 --> 01:06:29.507
The doctor says ‒

1129
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.802
Fanny's right, Gene.

1130
01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:39.058
Why don't you come back later?

1131
01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:06.252
All right.

1132
01:07:18.055 --> 01:07:20.057
She wants to see you.

1133
01:07:51.714 --> 01:07:53.340
Darling.

1134
01:07:53.424 --> 01:07:56.260
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yes, Mother.


1135
01:07:57.344 --> 01:07:59.680
- All you needed?
- Yes, Mother.


1136
01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:06.187
Are you sure you didn't catch cold
coming home?


1137
01:08:06.937 --> 01:08:08.856
I'm all right, Mother.

1138
01:08:11.984 --> 01:08:13.486
That's sweet.

1139
01:08:14.987 --> 01:08:16.530
Sweet.

1140
01:08:16.614 --> 01:08:18.491
What is, Mother darling?

1141
01:08:18.574 --> 01:08:20.868
My hand against your cheek.

1142
01:08:22.077 --> 01:08:24.038
I can feel it.

1143
01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:31.003
I wonder...

1144
01:08:32.004 --> 01:08:35.800
if Eugene and Lucy know
that we've come home.


1145
01:08:35.883 --> 01:08:37.718
I'm sure they do.

1146
01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:44.016
Has he asked about me?

1147
01:08:47.436 --> 01:08:48.437
Yes.

1148
01:08:49.313 --> 01:08:51.440
He was here.

1149
01:08:53.484 --> 01:08:55.444
Has he gone?

1150
01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.614
Yes, Mother.

1151
01:09:03.828 --> 01:09:05.663
I'd like to have seen him...

1152
01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:10.876
just once.

1153
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.842
She must rest now.

1154
01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:52.376
George!

1155
01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:54.920
She loved you.

1156
01:09:55.004 --> 01:09:56.755
She loved you.

1157
01:09:58.507 --> 01:10:02.177
<i>And now, Major Amberson was engaged</i>

1158
01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:05.014
<i>in the profoundest thinking of his life.</i>

1159
01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:08.434
<i>And he realized that everything
which had worried him or delighted him</i>


1160
01:10:08.517 --> 01:10:10.728
<i>during this lifetime</i> ‒

1161
01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:14.440
<i>all his buying and building
and trading and banking</i> ‒


1162
01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:19.653
<i>that it was all trifling and waste,
beside what concerned him now.</i>


1163
01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:25.784
<i>For the major knew now that he had to plan
how to enter an unknown country,</i>


1164
01:10:25.868 --> 01:10:30.080
<i>where he was not even sure
of being recognized as an Amberson.</i>


1165
01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:32.750
Father?

1166
01:10:33.459 --> 01:10:35.794
- Father.
- Ah?


1167
01:10:35.878 --> 01:10:38.672
The house was in Isabel's name, wasn't it?

1168
01:10:40.966 --> 01:10:42.343
Yes.

1169
01:10:42.426 --> 01:10:45.554
Can you remember when
you gave her the deed, Father?


1170
01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.141
No.

1171
01:10:49.224 --> 01:10:52.227
No, I... can't yet remember.

1172
01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:54.355
It doesn't matter.

1173
01:10:54.438 --> 01:10:57.733
Whole estate's about as mixed up
as an estate can get.


1174
01:10:57.816 --> 01:11:00.027
You oughta have that deed, George.

1175
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.112
No, don't bother.

1176
01:11:07.326 --> 01:11:08.327
Uh ‒

1177
01:11:09.578 --> 01:11:12.206
It must be in the sun.

1178
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.421
There wasn't anything here...
but the sun in the first place.


1179
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:24.635
The sun.

1180
01:11:24.718 --> 01:11:26.804
The Earth came out of the sun...

1181
01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.391
and we came out of the Earth.

1182
01:11:31.558 --> 01:11:37.272
So, whatever we are,
we must be of the Earth.


1183
01:11:47.074 --> 01:11:50.995
Well, odd way
for us to be saying good-bye.


1184
01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:54.957
One wouldn't have thought it
even a few years ago.


1185
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.042
But here we are.

1186
01:11:57.126 --> 01:12:01.046
Two gentlemen of elegant appearance
in a state of bustitude.


1187
01:12:03.382 --> 01:12:06.301
Ah, you can't ever tell
what'll happen at all, can you?


1188
01:12:07.469 --> 01:12:10.514
Once I stood where we're standing now
to say good-bye to a pretty girl.


1189
01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:12.766
Only it was in the old station,
before this was built.


1190
01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:14.852
We called it the depot.

1191
01:12:16.186 --> 01:12:19.773
We knew we wouldn't see each other
again for almost a year.


1192
01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:22.234
I thought I couldn't live through it.

1193
01:12:22.317 --> 01:12:24.319
She stood there crying.

1194
01:12:25.904 --> 01:12:28.407
Don't even know where she lives now.

1195
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:30.325
Or if she is living.

1196
01:12:31.702 --> 01:12:33.746
If she ever thinks of me,
she probably imagines


1197
01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:36.832
I'm still dancing in the ballroom
of the Amberson mansion.


1198
01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:40.961
She probably thinks of the mansion
as still beautiful,


1199
01:12:41.045 --> 01:12:43.130
still the finest house in town.

1200
01:12:45.674 --> 01:12:48.135
Ah, life and money both behave like...

1201
01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:51.430
loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks.

1202
01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:56.769
When they're gone, you can't tell where,
or what the devil you did with them.


1203
01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:59.063
But I... believe I'll say now,

1204
01:12:59.146 --> 01:13:01.148
while there isn't much time left

1205
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:04.026
for either of us to get
any more embarrassed, I ‒


1206
01:13:04.693 --> 01:13:06.695
I believe I'll say I've always
been fond of you, Georgie.


1207
01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:08.906
I can't say I've always liked you.

1208
01:13:08.989 --> 01:13:11.450
But we all spoiled you terribly
when you were a boy.


1209
01:13:11.533 --> 01:13:14.244
But you've had a pretty heavy jolt,
and you've taken it pretty quietly.


1210
01:13:14.328 --> 01:13:16.538
With the train coming into the shed,
you'll forgive me for saying


1211
01:13:16.622 --> 01:13:18.624
there have been times
I thought you oughta be hanged.


1212
01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:20.959
And just for a last word,
there may be somebody else in this town


1213
01:13:21.043 --> 01:13:22.628
who's always felt about you like that.

1214
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:25.506
Fond of you, I mean, no matter how much
it seems you oughta be hanged.


1215
01:13:25.589 --> 01:13:27.508
You might try ‒

1216
01:13:27.591 --> 01:13:29.093
I must run.

1217
01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:31.804
I'll send back the money
as fast as they pay me, so good-bye


1218
01:13:31.887 --> 01:13:33.514
and God bless you, Georgie.

1219
01:13:38.977 --> 01:13:42.564
Did you ever hear the Indian name
for that little grove of beech trees?


1220
01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:44.525
No.

1221
01:13:46.485 --> 01:13:48.487
You never did either.

1222
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.240
Well?

1223
01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:55.077
The name was... Loma
-Nashah.

1224
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.204
It means "They couldn't help it."

1225
01:13:57.287 --> 01:14:00.165
- Doesn't sound like it.
- Indian names don't.


1226
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:05.337
There was a bad Indian chief lived there,
the worst Indian that ever lived.


1227
01:14:06.213 --> 01:14:07.840
And his name was ‒

1228
01:14:07.923 --> 01:14:11.718
It was... Vendonah.

1229
01:14:11.802 --> 01:14:14.763
- Means "Rides down everything."
- What?


1230
01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:17.975
Name was Vendonah,
same thing as "Rides down everything."


1231
01:14:18.058 --> 01:14:20.060
I see.

1232
01:14:22.062 --> 01:14:23.355
Go on.

1233
01:14:24.815 --> 01:14:27.317
Vendonah was unspeakable.

1234
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:31.363
He was so proud, he wore iron shoes
and walked over people's faces with them.


1235
01:14:32.197 --> 01:14:35.909
So at last the tribe decided that it wasn't
a good enough excuse for him


1236
01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:38.412
that he was young and inexperienced.

1237
01:14:38.495 --> 01:14:41.123
He'd have to go.

1238
01:14:41.206 --> 01:14:44.251
So they took him down to the river,
put him in a canoe,


1239
01:14:44.334 --> 01:14:46.795
and pushed him out from shore.

1240
01:14:46.879 --> 01:14:50.090
And the current carried him
on down to the ocean.


1241
01:14:50.174 --> 01:14:52.551
And he never got back.

1242
01:14:52.634 --> 01:14:55.053
They didn't want him back, of course.

1243
01:14:55.137 --> 01:14:57.681
They hated Vendonah,

1244
01:14:57.764 --> 01:15:00.767
but they weren't able
to discover any other warrior


1245
01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:03.395
they wanted to make chief in his place.

1246
01:15:04.938 --> 01:15:07.441
They couldn't help feeling that way.

1247
01:15:07.524 --> 01:15:09.610
I see.

1248
01:15:09.693 --> 01:15:12.446
So that's why they named
the place "They Couldn't Help It."


1249
01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:14.156
Must have been.

1250
01:15:24.124 --> 01:15:26.752
So, you're going to stay in your garden.

1251
01:15:28.879 --> 01:15:33.800
You think it's better just to keep walking
about among your flower beds


1252
01:15:33.884 --> 01:15:35.510
till you get old...

1253
01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:40.265
like a pensive garden lady
in a Victorian engraving?


1254
01:15:40.933 --> 01:15:42.601
Hmm?

1255
01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:45.270
I suppose I'm like that tribe
that lived here, Papa.


1256
01:15:46.188 --> 01:15:48.523
I had too much unpleasant excitement.

1257
01:15:48.607 --> 01:15:50.317
I don't want any more.

1258
01:15:51.193 --> 01:15:54.279
In fact, I don't want anything but you.

1259
01:15:55.072 --> 01:15:57.032
You don't?

1260
01:15:57.115 --> 01:15:59.117
- What was the name of that grove?
- "They couldn't help ‒"


1261
01:15:59.201 --> 01:16:00.911
Oh, the Indian name, I mean.

1262
01:16:00.994 --> 01:16:02.412
Oh.

1263
01:16:02.496 --> 01:16:03.914
Mola
-Haha.

1264
01:16:06.124 --> 01:16:07.834
Mola
-Haha.

1265
01:16:08.919 --> 01:16:10.671
That wasn't the name you said.

1266
01:16:10.754 --> 01:16:12.297
Oh, I've forgotten.

1267
01:16:12.381 --> 01:16:14.007
I see you have.

1268
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:16.843
Perhaps you remember
the chief's name better.


1269
01:16:19.805 --> 01:16:21.306
I don't.

1270
01:16:25.602 --> 01:16:28.021
I hope someday you can forget it.

1271
01:16:30.482 --> 01:16:32.484
Please try and understand.

1272
01:16:32.567 --> 01:16:35.570
It's not doing either of us any good
going on arguing this way.


1273
01:16:35.654 --> 01:16:39.324
- That place you picked out ‒
- But this boardinghouse is practical.


1274
01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:42.035
- And we could be together.
- How?


1275
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:44.329
On eight dollars a week?

1276
01:16:44.413 --> 01:16:48.750
I'm only going to be getting
eight dollars a week at the law office.


1277
01:16:48.834 --> 01:16:52.212
Why, you'd be paying more
of the expenses than I would.


1278
01:16:52.296 --> 01:16:54.089
I'd be paying?

1279
01:16:55.007 --> 01:16:57.634
- I'd be paying?
- Certainly, you would.


1280
01:16:57.718 --> 01:16:59.553
We'd be using more of your money
than mine.


1281
01:16:59.636 --> 01:17:01.430
My money?

1282
01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:04.349
My ‒

1283
01:17:04.433 --> 01:17:07.686
I've ‒ I've got $28.

1284
01:17:07.769 --> 01:17:09.980
- That's all!
- Twenty-eight?


1285
01:17:10.063 --> 01:17:12.149
- Twenty-eight dollars?
- That's all.


1286
01:17:13.775 --> 01:17:17.195
I know I told Jack I didn't put everything
in the headlight company,


1287
01:17:17.279 --> 01:17:19.614
but I did.

1288
01:17:20.949 --> 01:17:22.659
Every cent.

1289
01:17:24.119 --> 01:17:25.787
And it's gone.

1290
01:17:25.871 --> 01:17:29.958
- Why did you wait till now to tell me?
- I couldn't tell till I had to.


1291
01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:32.627
It wouldn't do any good.

1292
01:17:32.711 --> 01:17:33.795
My gosh!

1293
01:17:33.879 --> 01:17:37.382
Oh, I know what you're gonna do.

1294
01:17:39.217 --> 01:17:42.596
You're ‒
You're gonna leave me in the lurch.


1295
01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:45.474
I'm only asking you to be reasonable,

1296
01:17:45.557 --> 01:17:49.311
to try and understand that it's impossible
for either of us to go on this way.


1297
01:17:49.394 --> 01:17:52.189
- Will you get up!
- I can't.


1298
01:17:53.982 --> 01:17:55.359
I'm too weak.

1299
01:17:55.442 --> 01:17:58.320
Oh, none of this makes any sense.

1300
01:17:58.403 --> 01:17:59.738
Will you get up.

1301
01:18:00.614 --> 01:18:04.618
I knew your mother'd
want me to watch over you.


1302
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:09.081
And try and make something
like a home for you.


1303
01:18:09.164 --> 01:18:10.957
And I tried.

1304
01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:14.795
I tried to make things
as nice for you as I could.


1305
01:18:14.878 --> 01:18:16.713
I know that.

1306
01:18:17.547 --> 01:18:22.552
I walked my heels down
looking for a place for us to live.


1307
01:18:23.845 --> 01:18:28.308
I ‒ I walked
and walked over this town.

1308
01:18:29.184 --> 01:18:31.019
I ‒

1309
01:18:31.103 --> 01:18:34.606
I didn't ride one block on a streetcar.

1310
01:18:36.942 --> 01:18:42.406
I wouldn't use five cents,
no matter how tired I was.


1311
01:18:42.489 --> 01:18:44.282
Oh, for the gosh
sakes, will you get up!

1312
01:18:44.366 --> 01:18:46.368
Don't sit there
with your back against the boiler.


1313
01:18:46.451 --> 01:18:48.161
Get up, Aunt Fanny!

1314
01:18:48.245 --> 01:18:51.748
It's not hot, it's cold.

1315
01:18:51.832 --> 01:18:54.251
The plumbers disconnected it.

1316
01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:58.547
I ‒ I wouldn't mind if they hadn't.

1317
01:19:00.757 --> 01:19:02.801
I wouldn't mind if it burned.

1318
01:19:03.427 --> 01:19:05.470
I wouldn't mind if it burned me, George!

1319
01:19:05.554 --> 01:19:08.265
Oh, Fanny, for gosh sakes, get up!

1320
01:19:08.348 --> 01:19:11.726
Now stop it! Stop it!
Listen to me. Do you hear me?


1321
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:13.937
Stop it! Stop it!

1322
01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.814
Listen to me now!

1323
01:19:15.897 --> 01:19:17.774
There. That's better.

1324
01:19:17.858 --> 01:19:20.652
Now let's see where we stand.

1325
01:19:20.735 --> 01:19:22.946
See if we can afford
this place you picked out.


1326
01:19:23.029 --> 01:19:27.242
I ‒ I'm sure the boardinghouse
is practical, George.


1327
01:19:27.325 --> 01:19:30.662
- I'm sure it's practical!
- I know it must be practical, Aunt Fanny.


1328
01:19:30.745 --> 01:19:34.791
And it is a comfort
to be among ‒ among nice people.


1329
01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:37.127
It's all right.
I was thinking of the money, Aunt Fanny.


1330
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.963
There's ‒ There's one great economy.

1331
01:19:40.046 --> 01:19:42.716
They ‒ They don't allow tipping.

1332
01:19:42.799 --> 01:19:44.801
They ‒ They have signs that prohibit it.

1333
01:19:44.885 --> 01:19:46.219
That's good.

1334
01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:48.388
But the rent's $36 a month,

1335
01:19:48.472 --> 01:19:51.308
and dinner's 22 and a
half for each of us.

1336
01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:53.602
I've got about a hundred dollars left.

1337
01:19:53.685 --> 01:19:55.604
A hundred dollars. That's all.

1338
01:19:55.687 --> 01:19:57.981
Won't need any new clothes for a year.

1339
01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:00.567
- Perhaps there ‒
- Oh, longer.


1340
01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.528
- So ‒ So, you see.
- Yes, I see.


1341
01:20:03.612 --> 01:20:06.907
I see that 36 and 45 make 81.

1342
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.576
That's the lowest.
We'll need a hundred dollars a month.


1343
01:20:11.369 --> 01:20:13.371
And I'm going to be making 32.

1344
01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:18.752
A real flair!

1345
01:20:18.835 --> 01:20:20.712
Real flair for the law.

1346
01:20:20.795 --> 01:20:24.049
That's right.
Couldn't wait till tomorrow to begin.


1347
01:20:24.132 --> 01:20:27.385
The law's a jealous mistress,
and a stern mistress.


1348
01:20:27.469 --> 01:20:30.180
I can't do it. 
I can't take up the law.

1349
01:20:30.263 --> 01:20:31.473
What?

1350
01:20:31.556 --> 01:20:34.100
I've come to tell you
that I've got to find something quicker,


1351
01:20:34.184 --> 01:20:35.977
something that pays from the start.

1352
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:39.648
I can't think of anything just this minute
that pays from the start.


1353
01:20:39.731 --> 01:20:43.693
Well, sir, I've heard that they pay very high
wages to people in dangerous trades.


1354
01:20:43.777 --> 01:20:46.905
People that handle touchy chemicals
or high explosives.


1355
01:20:46.988 --> 01:20:48.990
Men in the dynamite factories.

1356
01:20:49.074 --> 01:20:51.826
Thought I'd see
if I couldn't get a job like that.


1357
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:54.246
I want to get
started tomorrow, if I could.

1358
01:20:54.329 --> 01:20:57.415
Georgie, your grandfather and I
were boys together.


1359
01:20:57.499 --> 01:21:00.085
Don't you think I ought to know
what's the trouble?


1360
01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:02.963
Well, sir, it's Aunt Fanny.

1361
01:21:03.046 --> 01:21:05.799
She's set her mind
on this particular boardinghouse.


1362
01:21:05.882 --> 01:21:08.843
Seems she put everything
in the headlight company.


1363
01:21:08.927 --> 01:21:11.137
Well, she's got some old cronies.

1364
01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:13.890
I guess she's been looking forward
to the games of bridge


1365
01:21:13.974 --> 01:21:17.477
and the harmless kind of gossip
that goes on in such places.


1366
01:21:18.395 --> 01:21:21.565
Really, it's the life she'd like
better than anything else.


1367
01:21:21.648 --> 01:21:23.525
Struck me that
she's just about got to have it.


1368
01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:27.028
I got her in that headlight business with Jack.
I feel a certain responsibility myself.


1369
01:21:27.112 --> 01:21:29.531
I'm taking the responsibility.
She's not your aunt, you know, sir.


1370
01:21:29.614 --> 01:21:31.533
No, I'm unable to
see, even if she's yours,

1371
01:21:31.616 --> 01:21:34.494
that a young man is morally called upon
to give up a career at the law


1372
01:21:34.578 --> 01:21:37.998
to provide his aunt with a favorable
opportunity to play bridge whist.


1373
01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:41.960
All right, all right.

1374
01:21:42.043 --> 01:21:46.548
If you promise not to get blown up,
I'll see if we can find you the job.


1375
01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:50.927
You certainly are the most practical
young man I ever met.


1376
01:21:52.637 --> 01:21:55.557
<i>George Amberson Minafer
walked homeward slowly</i>


1377
01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.269
<i>through what seemed to be
the strange streets of a strange city.</i>


1378
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:03.356
<i>For the town was growing and changing.</i>

1379
01:22:04.357 --> 01:22:07.110
<i>It was heaving up in the middle incredibly.</i>

1380
01:22:07.861 --> 01:22:09.779
<i>It was spreading incredibly.</i>

1381
01:22:10.572 --> 01:22:13.116
<i>And as it heaved and spread,</i>

1382
01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:16.494
<i>it befouled itself and darkened its sky.</i>

1383
01:22:18.413 --> 01:22:21.374
<i>This was the last walk home</i>

1384
01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:25.837
<i>he was ever to take up National A venue
to Amberson Addition</i>


1385
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.923
<i>and the big old house
at the foot of Amberson Boulevard.</i>


1386
01:22:30.175 --> 01:22:32.302
<i>Tomorrow, they were to move out.</i>

1387
01:22:33.386 --> 01:22:35.597
<i>Tomorrow, everything would be gone.</i>

1388
01:22:44.356 --> 01:22:46.066
Mother, forgive me.

1389
01:22:49.319 --> 01:22:50.945
God forgive me.

1390
01:22:56.785 --> 01:22:59.079
<i>Something had happened.</i>

1391
01:22:59.162 --> 01:23:02.832
<i>A thing which, years ago,</i>

1392
01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:07.796
<i>had been the eagerest hope
of many, many good citizens of the town.</i>


1393
01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.300
<i>And now it came at last.</i>

1394
01:23:13.802 --> 01:23:18.515
<i>George Amberson Minafer
had got his comeuppance.</i>


1395
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:22.227
<i>He got it three times filled...</i>

1396
01:23:23.645 --> 01:23:25.480
<i>and running over.</i>

1397
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:31.820
<i>But those who had so longed for it
were not there to see it.</i>


1398
01:23:31.903 --> 01:23:33.738
<i>And they never knew it.</i>

1399
01:23:34.572 --> 01:23:36.741
<i>Those who were still living</i>

1400
01:23:36.825 --> 01:23:38.660
<i>had forgotten all about it...</i>

1401
01:23:39.661 --> 01:23:41.287
<i>and all about him.</i>

1402
01:23:43.373 --> 01:23:46.918
- All right, stay back there, now.
- He run into me as much as I run into him.


1403
01:23:47.001 --> 01:23:50.839
And if he gets well, he ain't gonna get
not one single cent out of me!


1404
01:23:50.922 --> 01:23:53.967
I'm perfectly willing to say I'm sorry for him,
and so's the lady with me.


1405
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:56.886
Wonderful the damage one of these
little machines can do. You'd never believe it.


1406
01:23:56.970 --> 01:23:59.055
All right, sonny.
Back in your car, back in your car.


1407
01:23:59.139 --> 01:24:01.141
All right. Stay back there now.

1408
01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:21.578
What are you going to do, Papa?

1409
01:24:33.548 --> 01:24:35.049
I'm going to him.

1410
01:24:40.346 --> 01:24:42.056
You coming, Papa?

1411
01:25:28.728 --> 01:25:30.355
How is he?

1412
01:25:31.314 --> 01:25:34.609
- How is Georgie?
- He's going to be all right.


1413
01:25:34.692 --> 01:25:39.197
Fanny, I wish you could have seen
George's face when he saw Lucy.


1414
01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:44.702
You know what he said to me
when we went into that room?


1415
01:25:45.537 --> 01:25:47.038
He said...

1416
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:53.753
"You must have known my mother
wanted you to come here today,


1417
01:25:53.837 --> 01:25:56.339
so that I could
ask you to forgive me."

1418
01:25:58.383 --> 01:25:59.884
We shook hands.

1419
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.227
I never noticed before
how much like Isabel Georgie looks.


1420
01:26:12.313 --> 01:26:13.940
You know something, Fanny?

1421
01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.153
I wouldn't tell this to anybody but you.

1422
01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:29.497
But it seemed to me
as if someone else was in that room.


1423
01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:36.129
And that through me,
she brought her boy under shelter again.


1424
01:26:39.883 --> 01:26:42.093
And that I'd been true at last...

1425
01:26:43.511 --> 01:26:45.430
to my true love.

1426
