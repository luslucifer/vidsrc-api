00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:47.856
<i>This is the universe.</i>

2
00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.649
<i>Big, isn't it?</i>

3
00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:54.988
<i>Thousands of suns, myriads of stars,</i>

4
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.824
<i>separated by immense distances</i>

5
00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.535
<i>and by thin, floating clouds of gas.</i>

6
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.455
<i>The starlight makes the gas transparent,</i>

7
00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.541
<i>and where there are no stars,</i>

8
00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:09.460
<i>it appears as dark, obscuring clouds,</i>

9
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.047
<i>like that great black cone over there.</i>

10
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.928
<i>Hello. There's a nova.</i>

11
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.890
<i>A whole solar system exploded.</i>

12
00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:24.934
<i>Someone must have been messing about</i>
<i>with the uranium atom.</i>


13
00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.355
<i>No, it's not our solar system,</i>
<i>I'm glad to say.</i>


14
00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.575
<i>Ah, those are called</i>
<i>a globular cluster of stars.</i>


15
00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.077
<i>Rather fine.</i>

16
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.377
<i>Down here in the right-hand corner,</i>

17
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.130
<i>see that little chap</i>
<i>rather like a Boy Scout's badge?</i>


18
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:58.843
<i>It's a mass of gas expanding</i>
<i>at thousands of cubic miles a minute.</i>


19
00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.939
<i>Ah, here we are.</i>
<i>We're getting near a home.</i>


20
00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:13.816
<i>The moon, our moon, in the first quarter.</i>

21
00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:17.820
<i>And here's the Earth, our Earth,</i>

22
00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:20.031
<i>moving around in its place,</i>

23
00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:23.284
<i>part of the pattern, part of the universe.</i>

24
00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:25.828
<i>Reassuring, isn't it?</i>

25
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.254
<i>It's night over Europe,</i>
<i>the night of the 2nd of May, 1945.</i>


26
00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:37.840
<i>That point of fire is a burning city.</i>

27
00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.843
<i>It had a thousand-bomber raid an hour ago.</i>

28
00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:54.774
<i>And here, rolling in over the Atlantic,</i>
<i>is a real English fog.</i>


29
00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:58.319
<i>I hope all our aircraft got home safely.</i>

30
00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:02.156
<i>Even the big ships sound frightened.</i>

31
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:06.995
<i>Listen to all the noises in the air.</i>

32
00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:10.289
<i>This was their finest hour.</i>

33
00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:13.418
<i>Listen.</i>

34
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.086
<i>Listen.</i>

35
00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.006
<i>Request your position.</i>
<i>Request your position.</i>


36
00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.342
<i>Come in, Lancaster. Come in, 
Lancaster.</i>

37
00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:24.554
<i>Position nil. Repeat nil. 
Age 27, 27.</i>

38
00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:26.514
<i>Did you get that? 
That's very important.</i>

39
00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:28.933
<i>Education interrupted,</i>
<i>violently interrupted.</i>


40
00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:30.518
<i>Religion, Church of England.</i>

41
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.688
<i>Politics, Conservative by nature,</i>
<i>Labour by experience.</i>


42
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.690
<i>What's your name?</i>

43
00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:38.651
I cannot read you, cannot read you.

44
00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:41.738
Request your position.
Can you see our signals?


45
00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:45.658
<i>"Oh, give me my scallop-shell of quiet,</i>

46
00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:47.744
<i>my staff of faith to walk upon,</i>

47

50
00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.587
<i>Sir Walter Raleigh wrote that.</i>

51
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.715
<i>I'd rather have written that</i>
<i>than flown through Hitler's legs.</i>


52
00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:05.928
I cannot understand you.

53
00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:07.513
Hello, Lancaster.

54
00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:10.641
We are sending signals.
Can you see our signals?


55
00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:13.311
Come in, Lancaster. Come in, Lancaster.

56
00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:50.306
"But at my back I always hear

57
00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.391
time's winged chariot hurrying near,

58
00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:56.729
and yonder all before us lie
deserts of vast eternity."


59
00:06:56.813 --> 00:06:59.440
Andy Marvell, what a marvel.
What's your name?


60
00:06:59.524 --> 00:07:03.444
Are you receiving me?
Repeat, are you receiving me?


61
00:07:03.528 --> 00:07:05.863
Request your position. Come in, Lancaster.

62
00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:08.116
You seem like a nice girl.
I can't give you my position.


63
00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.951
Instrument's gone. 
Crew gone too.

64
00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:12.161
All except Bob here, my sparks, he's dead.

65
00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:15.790
The rest all bailed out on my orders.
Time out 3:35. You get that?


66
00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:17.708
Crew bailed out 03:35.

67
00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.044
<i>Station Warrenden,</i>
<i>bomber group "A," "G" for George.</i>


68
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:21.754
<i>Send them a signal. Got that?</i>

69
00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.132
Station Warrenden,
bomber group "A," apple, "G," George.


70
00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:26.384
They'll be sorry about Bob.
We all liked him.


71
00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:31.848
Hello, "G," George.
Hello, "G," George. Are you all right?


72
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:34.142
Are you going to try and land?
Do you want a fix?


73
00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:36.310
The name's not "G," George.
It's "P," Peter.


74
00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:38.521
Peter D. Carter. "D" is for David.

75
00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:40.606
Squadron Leader Peter Carter.
No, I'm not going to land.


76
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.067
Undercarriage is gone,
inner port's on fire.


77
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.111
I'm bailing out presently.
I'm bailing out.


78
00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:47.697
- <i>Take a telegram.</i>
- Got your message.


79
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.866
Received your message. 
We can hear you.

80
00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.784
<i>Telegram to my mother.</i>

81
00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:55.788
<i>Mrs. Michael Carter,</i>
<i>88 Hampstead Lane, London Northwest.</i>


82
00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:57.415
88 Hampstead Lane, London.

83
00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.169
Tell her that I love her.

84
00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:04.172
You'll have to write this for me,
but what I want her to know is


85
00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:06.048
that I love her very much,

86
00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:08.551
that I've never shown it to her,
not really,


87
00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:10.761
but that I've loved her always,
right up to the end.


88
00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:14.557
<i>Give my love to my two sisters too.</i>
<i>Don't forget them.</i>


89
00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:19.645
Received your message. 
We can hear you.

90
00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:23.274
Are you wounded? Repeat, are you wounded?
Are you bailing out?


91
00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:25.359
- What's your name?
- June.


92
00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:28.946
Yes, June, I'm bailing out.
I'm bailing out, but there's a catch.


93
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.574
- I've got no parachute.
- Uh -


94
00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:34.285
Hello. Hello, Peter. 
Do not understand.

95
00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:38.456
Hello. Hello, Peter. 
Can you hear me?

96
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.375
<i>Hello, June.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid. It's quite simple.</i>


97
00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.004
We've had it, and
I'd rather jump than fry.

98
00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:47.089
After the first thousand feet,
what's the difference?


99
00:08:47.173 --> 00:08:49.008
I shan't know anything anyway.

100
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.219
I say, I hope I haven't frightened you.

101
00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:54.847
- No, I'm not frightened.
<i>- Good girl.</i>


102
00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:58.476
Your sparks - You said he was dead.
Hasn't he got a chute?


103
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:01.562
Cut to ribbons. Cannon shell.
June, are you pretty?


104
00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:03.356
Not bad.

105
00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:05.983
<i>- Can you hear me as well as I hear you?</i>
- Yes.


106
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.402
You've got a good voice.
You've got guts too.


107
00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:11.447
It's funny, I've known dozens of girls.
I've been in love with some of them.


108
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.784
But an American girl whom I've never seen
and who I never shall see


109
00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.410
will hear my last words.

110
00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:18.663
That's funny. It's rather sweet.

111
00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:22.041
June, if you're around
when they pick me up,


112
00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.626
turn your head away.

113
00:09:24.877 --> 00:09:28.130
Perhaps we can do something, Peter.
Let me report it.


114
00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:31.676
<i>No, no one can help. Only you.</i>
<i>Let me do this in my own way.</i>


115
00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.720
<i>I want to be alone with you, June.</i>
<i>Where were you born?</i>


116
00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:37.098
- Boston.
<i>- Mass?</i>


117
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:38.015
Yes.

118
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:40.101
That's a place to be born.
History was made there.


119
00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:42.353
Are you in love with anybody?
No. No, don't answer that.


120
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.647
I could love a man like you, Peter.

121
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.983
I love you, June.
You're life, and I'm leaving you.


122
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.484
Where do you live, on the station?

123
00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.404
No, in a big country house
about five miles from here.


124
00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:52.989
- Lee Wood House.
<i>- Old house?</i>


125
00:09:53.072 --> 00:09:54.198
Yes, very old.

126
00:09:54.282 --> 00:09:56.200
Good. I'll be a ghost
and come and see you.


127
00:09:56.284 --> 00:09:58.911
You're not frightened of ghosts, are you?
It would be awful if you were.


128
00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:01.956
- I'm not frightened.
<i>- What time will you be home?</i>


129
00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.749
Well, I'm on duty till 6:00.

130
00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:06.919
I have breakfast in the mess
and then I have to cycle half an hour.


131
00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:09.005
I often go along the sands.

132
00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:11.590
This is such nonsense.

133
00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:13.676
No, it's not.
It's the best sense I ever heard.


134
00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:16.887
I was lucky to get you, June.
It can't be helped about the parachute.


135
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.056
I'll have my wings soon anyway.
Big white ones.


136
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.226
I hope they haven't gone all modern.
I'd hate to have a prop instead of wings.


137
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:25.730
<i>What do you think the next world's like?</i>
<i>I've got my own ideas.</i>


138
00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:26.647
Oh, Peter.

139
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:29.650
I think it starts where this one leaves off
or where this one could leave off


140
00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:32.611
if we'd listened
to Plato and Aristotle and Jesus.


141
00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:36.574
With all of our little earthly problems solved,
but with greater ones worth the solving.


142
00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:39.368
I'll know soon enough anyway.
I'm signing off now, June.


143
00:10:39.452 --> 00:10:40.953
Good-bye! Good-bye, June!

144
00:10:41.037 --> 00:10:43.998
Hello, "G" for George? 
Hello, "G" George?

145
00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:46.584
Hello, "G" George? Hello -

146
00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:53.924
So long, Bob. I'll
see you in a minute.

147
00:10:54.008 --> 00:10:57.345
You'll know what we wear by now -
a prop or wings.


148
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:28.417
<i>A prop or wings.</i>

149
00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:32.254
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

150
00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:36.634
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

151
00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:41.055
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

152
00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:45.267
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

153
00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:49.355
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

154
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.639
Oh, bad luck, old boy.

155
00:13:15.232 --> 00:13:16.859
Name and rank?

156
00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:03.155
Come on, fellows, break it up.
Spread out here.


157
00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:05.616
Room with bath.

158
00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:08.494
- Oh, uh, do you have USO shows here?
- No, we don't.


159
00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:10.204
Okay, we'll stay.

160
00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:14.083
- Officer's quarters, of course.
- We're all the same up here, Captain.


161
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.503
Excuse me... brother.

162
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.554
Take over.

163
00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:31.308
- I wish I could make a phone call.
- From here? That would be long distance.


164
00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.520
- Flying Officer Trubshawe?
- Oh, I'm so sorry.


165
00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:36.355
You can't wait here any longer.

166
00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:38.440
You must be mistaken about your captain.

167
00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:41.860
- Well, if anyone's mistaken, it's not me.
- Mistakes don't happen here.


168
00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:44.113
But this is the aircrew section, isn't it?

169
00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:45.698
You should know.

170
00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:47.783
Peter couldn't have got away with it.

171
00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:52.830
Besides, you checked
his invoice for me, didn't you?


172
00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:55.499
Yes. It was against the regulations.

173
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:58.711
Regulations are made to be broken.

174
00:14:58.794 --> 00:15:02.464
He was due here half an hour after me.
This is his section, and he hasn't reported.


175
00:15:02.548 --> 00:15:05.551
So he's either AWOL
or there's been a mistake.


176
00:15:05.634 --> 00:15:08.178
There hasn't been a mistake here
for a thousand years.


177
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.473
Oh! So there have been mistakes?

178
00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:15.060
The girl that was here before me,
she was here 640 years.


179
00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:16.270
Holy smoke!

180
00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:18.188
She said when the records don't balance,

181
00:15:18.272 --> 00:15:20.649
all of the alarm bells start ringing
in the records office.


182
00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:23.611
I bet they do. 
Proper flap, eh?

183
00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:25.070
Yes.

184
00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:38.292
That's only the living records.

185
00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:42.588
Everyone on Earth has a file -
Russian, Chinese, black, or white,


186
00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:44.673
rich or poor, Republican or Democrat.

187
00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:46.133
Holy smoke.

188
00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:49.470
If anybody had told me the clocks were
working away up here, just like on Earth -


189
00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:51.805
Everyone here is allowed
to start how they like.


190
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:56.393
It's heaven, isn't it?

191
00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:02.191
You see,

192
00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:06.028
there are millions of people on Earth
who would think it heaven to be a clock.


193
00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:10.282
- And don't say, "Holy smoke."
- Why not?


194
00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:15.454
There's no smoke without fire,
and we don't call smoke holy.


195
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:19.500
Thanks for the gin, 
Section Officer.

196
00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:22.753
Boy, oh, boy! Home was nothing like this!

197
00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:27.132
Mine was.

198
00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:34.807
Sign here.

199
00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:38.727
Oh, all right.
I don't want to start those bells ringing.


200
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.085
I wonder where I report.

201
00:19:27.187 --> 00:19:29.606
Oh, I always hoped there would be dogs.

202
00:20:04.224 --> 00:20:05.726
Good morning.

203
00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:09.646
- Morning.
- Where do I go from here?


204
00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:13.859
- Huh?
- I'm new. I only just arrived.


205
00:20:13.942 --> 00:20:15.777
Where do I report?

206
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:17.863
You mean the aerodrome?

207
00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:19.531
Aerodrome?

208
00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:27.331
- Where am I?
- Huh?


209
00:20:27.414 --> 00:20:29.374
- This place, what's it called?
- The Boroughs.


210
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:31.919
- The Boroughs, where?
- Lee Wood.


211
00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:33.629
- Lee Wood?
- Yeah.


212
00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:35.547
Do you know a
house called Lee Wood House?

213
00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:37.132
That's it.

214
00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:40.385
- Where the smoke is, behind those trees.
- Is that the quickest way?


215
00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:43.138
There's a track from the beach.
See that bike?


216
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:51.772
- Who is it?
- Don't know. One of the Yank girls.


217
00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:54.232
They live up at the house.

218
00:20:59.404 --> 00:21:01.657
Here, Jock.

219
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.708
Hey!

220
00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:23.345
- Hello.
- Hello yourself. What's wrong?


221
00:21:27.391 --> 00:21:28.934
You're June.

222
00:21:36.274 --> 00:21:37.693
You're Peter!

223
00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:44.074
How did you get here?

224
00:21:44.157 --> 00:21:47.786
I'm glad you're safe.
What did you do? What happened?


225
00:21:47.869 --> 00:21:49.371
I don't know. I just don't know.

226
00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:51.665
- Are you hurt?
- My head feels a bit queer.


227
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:56.294
Oh, there's a little cut in your hair.
It's nothing much.


228
00:21:57.337 --> 00:21:59.297
Oh, Peter, it was a cruel joke.

229
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.383
If it was, it was on me.

230
00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:04.177
I've been crying so
ever since we said good-bye.


231
00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:05.887
Don't cry, darling.

232
00:22:06.763 --> 00:22:08.807
Peter, darling.

233
00:22:20.193 --> 00:22:23.530
91,716 invoiced,

234
00:22:23.613 --> 00:22:27.242
91,715 checked in.

235
00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:29.119
Conductor 71?

236
00:22:29.202 --> 00:22:30.912
Madame, it could have happened to anybody.

237
00:22:30.996 --> 00:22:32.205
How did it happen?

238
00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:35.500
Everything was calculated
except for this accursed fog.


239
00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:39.337
The pilot jumped, he got lost in the fog,
I missed him.


240
00:22:41.214 --> 00:22:42.966
Flying Officer Trubshawe.

241
00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:52.476
You've been waiting all day for your pilot.

242
00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.977
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:56.813
You see, over the Channel
we ran into this ruddy pea-souper.


244
00:22:56.897 --> 00:22:58.231
Aha.

245
00:22:58.315 --> 00:23:00.233
Oh, excuse the language, ma'am,

246
00:23:00.317 --> 00:23:02.235
but really, it was so thick that you
could have stepped out of the kite


247
00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.528
and walked about on it.

248
00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:04.738
<i>Sacré brouillard!</i>

249
00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:09.868
And he, the skipper, ordered everybody
to bail out when we were over the coast.


250
00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:13.330
He knew his brolly - chute -
had been written off.


251
00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:15.332
It got a direct hit
as he was bandaging me.


252
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.667
But he didn't tell the others.

253
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:20.170
I only knew about it
because I'd bought it by then.


254
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:23.006
I mean, I was... dead.

255
00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:25.675
I understand.

256
00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:27.969
And I knew he'd be clocking in here,

257
00:23:28.053 --> 00:23:30.847
so I thought I'd stooge around
and wait for him.


258
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:33.767
Oh, this young lady is
not to blame at all.

259
00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:37.521
- I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
- Thank you.


260
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.235
Nineteen hours and 50 minutes
have elapsed.


261
00:23:43.902 --> 00:23:47.322
Don't you know that any slip
must be reported immediately?


262
00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:50.158
- I lost my head.
- Not long in the service?


263
00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:53.578
I joined in the so-called second germinal

264
00:23:53.662 --> 00:23:56.623
of the so-called glorious French Revolution.

265
00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:58.792
I see. Natural death.

266
00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:01.419
I lost my head.

267
00:24:04.673 --> 00:24:06.216
The case is not so simple.

268
00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:08.176
- No?
- No.


269
00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.262
He's fallen in love.

270
00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:12.264
Ah!

271
00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:13.181
Oh!

272
00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:15.392
- It complicates things.
- True, madame.


273
00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:18.145
- You must do your best.
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>


274
00:24:18.228 --> 00:24:20.772
- You'll proceed to Earth immediately.
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>


275
00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:23.900
You will explain your grave error
to Squadron Leader Carter -


276
00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:25.569
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>
- and ask him to follow you.


277
00:24:25.652 --> 00:24:27.404
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>
- Wait.


278
00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:31.491
Your captain is not an unreasonable man,
I hope?


279
00:24:31.575 --> 00:24:34.744
The skipper? Oh, no, ma'am.
Unless he's had a few, of course.


280
00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:37.164
<i>Euh, pardon?</i> "Had a few"?

281
00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:40.167
Beers.

282
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.336
Scotch being hard to come by, you know.

283
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.838
<i>Naturellement.</i>

284
00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:48.133
By the way, Monsieur, when you see Peter,
would you give him a message for me?


285
00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:51.887
<i>- A vec plaisir.</i>
- Just say, "What ho."


286
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.138
<i>Bon.</i>

287
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.698
One is starved for Technicolor up there.

288
00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:18.246
What a night for love.

289
00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.567
Drink, darling?

290
00:26:56.511 --> 00:26:57.554
<i>Mon Ami?</i>

291
00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:02.559
Evening.

292
00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:07.522
I think I keep these for a little.

293
00:27:08.398 --> 00:27:11.526
- And how are you, my friend?
- I've never been better.


294
00:27:12.944 --> 00:27:14.446
- June, wake.
- She cannot wake.


295
00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:18.366
We are talking in space, not in time.

296
00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:21.494
Are you cracked?

297
00:27:21.578 --> 00:27:23.413
Look at your watch.

298
00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:28.918
It has not moved since you said,
so charmingly, "Drink, darling?"


299
00:27:29.002 --> 00:27:33.506
Nor will it move, nor will anything move...

300
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:37.177
until we have finished our little talk.

301
00:27:37.677 --> 00:27:38.928
It is only a trick.

302
00:27:40.555 --> 00:27:41.556
Who are you?

303
00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:45.393
We should have met yesterday
at 04:10, <i>Mon Cher.</i>


304
00:27:45.477 --> 00:27:47.270
Unfortunately, I missed you.

305
00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:49.731
Well, you couldn't have missed me
because I wasn't here. Now, who the -


306
00:27:49.814 --> 00:27:53.276
I bring you a message from Mr. Trubshawe.

307
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.530
Bob? Bob's dead.

308
00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:00.283
Oh, yes, he's dead.

309
00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:02.327
He says, "What ho."

310
00:28:03.286 --> 00:28:05.830
Well, that sounds like Trubshawe.
But he is dead, isn't he?


311
00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:07.624
<i>En effet.</i> But how?

312
00:28:07.707 --> 00:28:09.084
- Why?
- Cannon shell.


313
00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:13.546
And what should happen to a man
who jumps from his aircraft


314
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.173
without his parachute?

315
00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:17.342
How do you know?

316
00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:21.554
But it is I who am telling you, my friend.
It is I.


317
00:28:21.638 --> 00:28:23.598
Your time was up,

318
00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:27.769
but they missed you because
of your ridiculous English climate.


319
00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:29.437
I am French.

320
00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:33.733
- But what do you want now?
- You, my friend.


321
00:28:33.817 --> 00:28:35.777
- What for?
- To conduct you.


322
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.488
- Where to?
- To the training center.


323
00:28:38.571 --> 00:28:41.074
- Training for what?
- For another world.


324
00:28:44.744 --> 00:28:45.912
You don't mean -

325
00:28:45.995 --> 00:28:50.458
But, my dear friend,
that is just what I do mean.


326
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.337
Oh, this is absolutely fantastic. June?

327
00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:58.174
June!

328
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:03.430
All right. And what
if I refuse to go?

329
00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:05.390
But you cannot refuse.

330
00:29:05.473 --> 00:29:07.308
Your time was up.

331
00:29:07.392 --> 00:29:11.187
Now, by mistake, you overstayed by about,

332
00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:14.899
speaking in time, of course, 20 hours.

333
00:29:14.983 --> 00:29:17.485
The advantage was exclusively yours.

334
00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:20.155
You lost nothing. 
You only gained.

335
00:29:20.238 --> 00:29:21.448
What about her?

336
00:29:26.744 --> 00:29:28.329
<i>Exquise.</i>

337
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.000
You will see her again
when her time comes.


338
00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:37.505
She will live to be 97.

339
00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:39.090
I looked her up in the files.

340
00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:43.136
- I'm in love with her.
- But, my friend, what is love?


341
00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:45.054
The feeling of the moment.

342
00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:47.307
But I represent eternity,

343
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.809
the law of this world and the other.

344
00:29:49.893 --> 00:29:52.312
- Good, but what is law?
- Law is law.


345
00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:54.481
- Yes, but law is based on reason.
- That is so.


346
00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:58.109
Now, yesterday I wasn't in love.
Today I am.


347
00:29:58.193 --> 00:30:01.488
But, my friend, what is love?
How many people are in love?


348
00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:04.032
Soldiers, airmen. 
How many sailors?

349
00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:06.868
Do they protest when their time is up?
No, they don't.


350
00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:08.453
- They have no right.
- Exactly.


351
00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:09.704
- But I have.
- Why?


352
00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:13.082
Look, I've fallen in love
because of your mistake.


353
00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:16.085
I'm in an entirely different position
from what I was in last night.


354
00:30:16.169 --> 00:30:18.379
Then I expected to die,
I was ready to die,


355
00:30:18.463 --> 00:30:21.007
and it wasn't my fault that I didn't,
it was yours.


356
00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:24.219
- What kind of government do you represent?
- I do not represent any government.


357
00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:26.095
Well, what laws govern
the place you come from?


358
00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:28.306
I am not permitted
to express any political views.


359
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:30.975
Well, if it's a respectable place,
there must be a law of appeal.


360
00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:32.852
But, my friend, be reasonable.
Appeal to whom?


361
00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:35.146
- That's for you to find out.
- But it's never been done.


362
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.899
Is that any reason
why it can't be done now?


363
00:30:37.982 --> 00:30:40.985
You are determined
to get me into this salad.


364
00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:43.238
And what about the
salad you got me into?

365
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:46.991
Now look here, you don't want me
to use force, do you?


366
00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:49.244
Well, you can always try.

367
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:53.122
- I think I'll leave you for a little.
- That's the form.


368
00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:56.793
- I shall report for instructions.
- Now you're talking.


369
00:30:56.876 --> 00:31:01.839
And do not fall any deeper in love now.
You have been warned.


370
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:05.927
She is... charming.

371
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.513
You know, I think
you're not a bad chap.

372
00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:12.976
- Do you play chess?
- Yes.


373
00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:14.644
So do I.

374
00:31:14.727 --> 00:31:17.230
We could play every day.

375
00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:21.234
Some other time.

376
00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:23.736
Next time perhaps?

377
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.906
<i>Au revoir, Mon ami.</i>

378
00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:36.082
No, thank you, darling.

379
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.585
"No, thank you" what?

380
00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:42.255
You just asked me to have a drink.

381
00:31:45.925 --> 00:31:47.343
Did I?

382
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:53.391
Yes, I remember I did.

383
00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:57.854
What's the matter with me?

384
00:31:57.937 --> 00:32:00.481
What is it? Is it your head again?

385
00:32:00.565 --> 00:32:02.191
It might be, yes.

386
00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:05.903
An odd thing happened
while you were asleep.


387
00:32:06.904 --> 00:32:08.990
I haven't been asleep.

388
00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:11.492
Didn't you hear us talking?

389
00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:14.120
No. Who was there to talk to?

390
00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:17.081
- They sent somebody.
- "They"?


391
00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:19.083
Who are they?

392
00:32:19.792 --> 00:32:21.502
I don't know.

393
00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:27.550
June, do I look cracked?

394
00:32:27.634 --> 00:32:29.927
Not to me, darling. Are you?

395
00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:34.974
Look, there was a ten-tenths fog last night.
That's right, isn't it?


396
00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:36.643
You know there was.

397
00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:39.729
- And I did bail out without a parachute?
- That's your story.


398
00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:42.815
So how can I be alive?

399
00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:45.777
I give up. I don't
know and I don't care.

400
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.779
I had no parachute. 
It was shot up.

401
00:32:47.862 --> 00:32:49.822
And when I came to this morning,
I had no parachute.


402
00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:51.532
Anyway, why wasn't I drowned?

403
00:32:51.616 --> 00:32:53.534
You don't need to prove to me
that you ought to be dead.


404
00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:55.453
Well, I ought to be,
according to this character.


405
00:32:55.536 --> 00:32:56.537
What character?

406
00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:58.623
Well, this conductor character
they sent after me.


407
00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.500
He says he missed me in the fog.

408
00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:03.586
Bad luck for them, good luck for me.

409
00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:06.964
I told him I was going to appeal.
He's gone off to get instructions.


410
00:33:07.048 --> 00:33:08.800
It's not my fault I'm not dead.

411
00:33:08.883 --> 00:33:12.512
It's not my fault that I've found you
and fell in love with you.


412
00:33:14.472 --> 00:33:17.975
Maybe he wasn't here at all.
Hey, you, Frenchman!


413
00:33:18.726 --> 00:33:20.228
Where are you?

414
00:33:21.979 --> 00:33:24.816
- What is it?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.


415
00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:36.452
June!

416
00:33:37.578 --> 00:33:39.414
June, you're there, aren't you?

417
00:33:39.497 --> 00:33:41.749
Yes, Peter, of course I'm here.

418
00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:44.252
Oh!

419
00:33:44.335 --> 00:33:46.337
I thought I'd lost you.

420
00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:55.221
Dr. Reeves's residence.

421
00:33:55.304 --> 00:33:57.390
Oh, good morning, Miss June.

422
00:33:57.473 --> 00:33:58.850
Yes, isn't it?

423
00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:02.478
The doctor's up in his thing,
you know, his camera obscura.


424
00:34:02.562 --> 00:34:04.605
He's got his new lens
from the shop this morning,


425
00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:06.774
and it makes a lovely picture.

426
00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:10.027
He's taken the big white garden table
to project on.


427
00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:13.698
He'll be glad you're coming over.
He's showing it to the dogs now.


428
00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:15.366
Ah!

429
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.285
Nice day.

430
00:34:17.368 --> 00:34:19.746
Hmm. Mrs. Bibble's ducks are too early.

431
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:22.248
She'll lose all the eggs
if she's not careful.


432
00:34:22.331 --> 00:34:25.793
Ah, the start of the cycling season.

433
00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:29.380
There's a hefty young girl.
Time Mrs. Tucker went to get our rations.


434
00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:32.759
There she is.
Oh, the vicar and his sister.


435
00:34:32.842 --> 00:34:35.136
Not coming here, I hope. No. Good.

436
00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:38.598
Quite a queue at the butcher's.
Must have some offal.


437
00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:41.476
Wonderful how the kids
love playing in the splash.


438
00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:42.935
Just the same in my day.

439
00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:47.523
That tree ought to come down.

440
00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:54.530
Old Mary looking quite skittish.

441
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:57.116
Sally Allgood getting herself dated up.

442
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.869
Ah, here's June. 
Here she comes.

443
00:35:00.536 --> 00:35:03.706
"She walks in beauty like the night."

444
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.375
Only she's cycling and the sun is out.

445
00:35:06.459 --> 00:35:10.463
Nice girl. Worth a hat full of ambassadors
in Lee Wood anyway.


446
00:35:19.597 --> 00:35:21.098
Come on up!

447
00:35:32.944 --> 00:35:35.988
- Hello, Doc.
- Hello, June. Come in. Shut the door.


448
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.332
- Surveying your kingdom?
- A village doctor has to know everything.


449
00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:49.502
You would be surprised
how many diagnoses I've formed up here.


450
00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:54.549
I love looking at the village from here.
It looks so different.


451
00:35:55.925 --> 00:35:59.262
That's because you see it all clearly
and at once, as in a poet's eye.


452
00:36:00.012 --> 00:36:01.514
I want to talk to you.

453
00:36:01.597 --> 00:36:03.766
So you said on the phone,
but it's really none of my business.


454
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.977
Dr. McEwen says
it's right down your street.


455
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.981
This is my street, a village street,
and I'm a village doctor.


456
00:36:10.064 --> 00:36:12.316
Only because you like living in a village.

457
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.903
Dr. McEwen says what you don't know
about neurology would fill a peanut.


458
00:36:15.987 --> 00:36:17.947
Well, I'm a good guesser.

459
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.700
Your guesses are published
by very famous magazines


460
00:36:20.783 --> 00:36:23.035
like that <i>Brain</i> I've seen in your library.

461
00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.121
- Dr. McEwen says -
- I know what Dr. McEwen says.


462
00:36:25.204 --> 00:36:27.206
I had a talk with him
on the phone this morning.


463
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.875
Oh, did you?

464
00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:31.627
After I talked to you.

465
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:33.880
This is really the RAF's business.

466
00:36:33.963 --> 00:36:36.173
Carter should have rejoined
his station today.


467
00:36:36.257 --> 00:36:39.260
- I know.
- Anyhow, what's it got to do with you?


468
00:36:39.343 --> 00:36:42.471
- Oh, I'm just interested.
- Oh, I see.


469
00:36:42.555 --> 00:36:44.599
But strictly speaking, he's a RAF case.

470
00:36:44.682 --> 00:36:48.185
He's not a case at all.
He's a person. A very fine person.


471
00:36:48.269 --> 00:36:50.021
And I want you to see him, Frank.

472
00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:53.107
I don't want just anybody mauling him about
and asking him questions.


473
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.319
I want you.
I'm sure the RAF would say that -


474
00:36:56.402 --> 00:36:59.155
I know what the RAF would say.
I had a talk to his CO this morning.


475
00:36:59.238 --> 00:37:00.239
Oh, Frank.

476
00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:02.158
And I had a talk
to his group medical officer too.


477
00:37:02.241 --> 00:37:04.452
- Fortunately he's heard of me.
- Oh, Frank.


478
00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:07.747
And if you'd done that earlier,
I would have told you earlier.


479
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.625
You can't go around the place
kidnapping good-looking RAF officers


480
00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:12.543
just because
you like the shape of their nose.


481
00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:16.088
It's not his nose, it's his voice.
I fell for that before I ever saw him.


482
00:37:16.172 --> 00:37:18.257
He still believes that he bailed out
without a parachute?


483
00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.800
- Yes.
- And he has hallucinations?


484
00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:20.718
Mm-hmm.

485
00:37:20.801 --> 00:37:22.803
And during these bouts,
does he go rather pale?


486
00:37:22.887 --> 00:37:25.890
- Yes, yes, he did.
- And he has headaches, here?


487
00:37:25.973 --> 00:37:28.309
I think so. I don't know.
You'd better ask him.


488
00:37:28.392 --> 00:37:30.811
- But he definitely sees things?
- And hears.


489
00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:32.480
All right.

490
00:37:32.563 --> 00:37:34.899
- Did you tell him he was talking rubbish?
- No.


491
00:37:34.982 --> 00:37:36.734
- Quite right.
- He's not talking rubbish.


492
00:37:36.817 --> 00:37:38.319
He's talking very logically.

493
00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:40.696
Then he can't be in love. Bye.

494
00:37:43.282 --> 00:37:44.784
- Frank?
- Yes?


495
00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:46.869
He has a very cute nose too.

496
00:37:46.953 --> 00:37:49.163
- I'll be over about teatime.
- Right.


497
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.979
It's Dr. Reeves. Let's go.

498
00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:46.345
Yippee!

499
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:59.358
That's not the way to spell Shakespeare.

500
00:38:59.442 --> 00:39:00.943
Who are you? His agent?

501
00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:03.487
"You spotted snakes with double tongues.

502
00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:06.490
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.

503
00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:10.411
Newts and blind worms -"

504
00:39:10.494 --> 00:39:12.163
Um 
- Uh -

505
00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:14.081
- "Do no wrong."
- "Do no wrong.


506
00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:16.375
Come not near our Fairy Queen."

507
00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:19.712
"Oh, you can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?"


508
00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:21.005
"Some guy or other -"

509
00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:24.717
No, no, no, my dear Private Logan,
Bottom's not a gangster.


510
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.177
Now, watch me.

511
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.637
"Some man or other must present Wall,

512
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:30.848
and let him have some plaster
or some loam,


513
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:34.435
or some rough-cast about him
to signify Wall,


514
00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:36.729
and let him hold his fingers thus,

515
00:39:36.812 --> 00:39:40.441
and through that cranny
shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper."


516
00:39:40.524 --> 00:39:42.651
- Now try that, my boy.
- Can I do the business?


517
00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:45.362
- Business as well, yes.
- Oh, brother.


518
00:39:46.113 --> 00:39:48.491
"Some man or other must present Wall,

519
00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:51.577
and let him have some plaster
or some loam,


520
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.872
or some rough-cast about him
to signify Wall."


521
00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:18.437
Check.

522
00:40:25.236 --> 00:40:27.780
Peter, check.

523
00:40:27.863 --> 00:40:31.575
"Peaseblossom. Cobweb.
Moth and mustard seed."


524
00:40:32.618 --> 00:40:34.453
Oh, dear, I didn't see that one coming.

525
00:40:34.537 --> 00:40:37.414
"Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.

526
00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:39.917
- Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes."
- Good afternoon.


527
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.294
Hello, Frank.
Squadron Leader Carter, Dr. Reeves.


528
00:40:42.378 --> 00:40:43.671
- How do you do?
- How do you do?


529
00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:45.840
- Do I get some tea?
- Mmm. It's ordered. Ginger cookies.


530
00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:48.217
- Good. Who's winning?
- June's very good.


531
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.553
But he's winning. 
Sit down, everybody.

532
00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:51.846
Thanks.

533
00:40:52.888 --> 00:40:55.766
- "I beseech your worship's name.
- Thank you.


534
00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.103
I shall desire you of more acquaintance,
good Master Cobweb.


535
00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:01.981
If I cut my finger,
I shall make bold with you.


536
00:41:02.064 --> 00:41:04.066
Your name, honest gentleman?"

537
00:41:06.068 --> 00:41:07.987
- I told Peter.
- What?


538
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.906
- Who you are, what you are, all about you.
- Mmm. Tall order.


539
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.992
And I've told you all about him.

540
00:41:13.075 --> 00:41:14.994
- Has she read your poems?
- What poems?


541
00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:17.454
Well, didn't you know
this is Peter Carter?


542
00:41:18.747 --> 00:41:21.167
- I didn't know.
- We hadn't got around to that yet.


543
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.044
I haven't got much modern stuff
in my library, but you're there.


544
00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:25.004
Oh, good.

545
00:41:25.087 --> 00:41:26.922
I like your point of view
and I like your English.


546
00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:29.758
- I hope we shall have some talks together.
- So do I.


547
00:41:30.509 --> 00:41:32.845
Now let's get down to this thing.

548
00:41:32.928 --> 00:41:35.347
You've never had any visions
or hallucinations before?


549
00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:37.266
- Never.
- What were you in civil life?


550
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:38.767
- I was at Oxford.
- Specializing?


551
00:41:38.851 --> 00:41:41.061
- European history.
- Hmm.


552
00:41:41.145 --> 00:41:43.397
- Both parents alive?
- My mother.


553
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.275
- Brothers, sisters?
- Two sisters, both in the Wrens.


554
00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:49.820
- What was the cause of your father's death?
- Same as mine.


555
00:41:49.904 --> 00:41:51.697
- Brain?
- No, war.


556
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.199
- When?
- 1917.


557
00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.744
- You're, um, 29?
- Twenty-seven.


558
00:41:56.827 --> 00:41:58.287
- Called up?
- No, volunteered.


559
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:00.497
- Trained in Canada, went on ops in '41.
- Bomber?


560
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:03.209
A spell of coastal, a spell of instructor.
Back to bombers, Lancasters.


561
00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:05.544
- You must have done a good many operations.
- Sixty-seven.


562
00:42:05.628 --> 00:42:08.839
I'm surprised they let you go back,
with your experience and seniority.


563
00:42:08.923 --> 00:42:10.424
With a new job - master bomber.

564
00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:12.218
- Tricky?
- Somebody's got to do it.


565
00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:13.886
Hmm.

566
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.351
Now about these headaches.
When did they start?


567
00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:22.394
- Headaches?
- Oh, I know you get them.


568
00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:25.272
I know you've had them for some time,
and I know you've told nobody about them,


569
00:42:25.356 --> 00:42:26.941
especially your MO, right?

570
00:42:27.024 --> 00:42:29.818
- What else do you know?
- I know about your eyes.


571
00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:32.571
- You know a good deal.
- I'd like to know more.


572
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:35.324
All right.

573
00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:38.369
Good.

574
00:42:38.452 --> 00:42:40.537
These headaches, when did this start?

575
00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:42.248
- About six months ago.
- Bad?


576
00:42:42.331 --> 00:42:43.874
- Not at first.
- Where mostly?


577
00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:45.876
Here.

578
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.920
Frontal and temporal.

579
00:42:48.003 --> 00:42:50.673
Did you ever have
a rather nasty bang on the head?


580
00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:52.800
- I don't think so.
- Sure?


581
00:42:52.883 --> 00:42:55.552
The usual one - dropped as a baby.

582
00:42:55.636 --> 00:42:59.014
- Does that support everything for you?
- Yes, I'm afraid it does.


583
00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:01.225
I'll see what I can cook up.

584
00:43:01.308 --> 00:43:04.019
- Do you mind if I try something?
- No, go ahead.


585
00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:07.564
Now, uh, just face this way. Don't move.

586
00:43:09.775 --> 00:43:12.361
Now, don't move your eyes.
Look straight ahead.


587
00:43:13.028 --> 00:43:14.780
- Check.
- What are you looking at?


588
00:43:14.863 --> 00:43:16.865
That girl with the
red hair and the legs.

589
00:43:16.949 --> 00:43:19.243
All right, I've got her.
Don't take your eyes off her.


590
00:43:19.326 --> 00:43:20.744
This is going to be easy.

591
00:43:20.828 --> 00:43:24.915
Now, without moving your eyes,
what can you see on the extreme right?


592
00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:26.083
Fireplace.

593
00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:27.668
- In the center?
- Girl.


594
00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.253
Extreme left?

595
00:43:31.297 --> 00:43:32.881
Windows.

596
00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:34.466
- Curtains?
- Yes.


597
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.093
- Color?
- Red.


598
00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:38.971
All right, that will do.

599
00:43:39.054 --> 00:43:41.974
Well, if you're quite done staring
at that girl's legs, both of you.


600
00:43:42.057 --> 00:43:43.350
Well, you've got to do
what the doctor tells you.


601
00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:45.602
Confidentially,
they're rather knock-kneed.


602
00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:51.900
Hmm.

603
00:43:51.984 --> 00:43:53.986
- Now, any loss of appetite?
- No.


604
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:55.571
- Nor of thirst?
- No fear.


605
00:43:55.654 --> 00:43:58.324
In fact, if anything, you've been eating
and drinking rather more than usual?


606
00:43:58.407 --> 00:43:59.950
You've just been looking at my mess bills.

607
00:44:00.868 --> 00:44:04.038
And you've seen something?

608
00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:05.664
- Someone.
- Clearly?


609
00:44:05.748 --> 00:44:07.666
As clear as I see you.

610
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.752
Have you had
a similar hallucination before?


611
00:44:09.835 --> 00:44:11.712
No, thanks.

612
00:44:11.795 --> 00:44:15.632
Tell me, do you believe in the survival
of human personality after death?


613
00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:18.719
I thought you said you read my verses?

614
00:44:19.636 --> 00:44:21.472
Do you?

615
00:44:21.555 --> 00:44:24.183
I don't know. I've never thought about it.
Do you?


616
00:44:25.184 --> 00:44:27.519
I don't know.
I've thought about it too much.


617
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.028
- I thought I was asked to tea?
- It isn't time yet.


618
00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:37.654
Past my time.

619
00:44:37.738 --> 00:44:40.240
One last question. 
It may sound silly.

620
00:44:40.324 --> 00:44:44.286
But, um, have you imagined recently
that you've smelled something


621
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.456
that couldn't possibly be there?

622
00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:50.084
- What an extraordinary thing.
- What is?


623
00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:52.753
- How did you know?
- It was a long shot. You have?


624
00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:55.589
Yes, but it was so silly,
I would never have told you.


625
00:44:55.672 --> 00:44:59.218
It's important. It might explain everything
abnormal that you've seen and heard.


626
00:44:59.301 --> 00:45:00.594
Well, that would be a relief.

627
00:45:00.677 --> 00:45:03.305
But it still can't explain how I can jump
without a parachute and be alive.


628
00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:04.723
No, it couldn't do that,

629
00:45:04.807 --> 00:45:07.810
but there might be a possible explanation
even of that.


630
00:45:07.893 --> 00:45:11.271
Now, this heavenly messenger.
You saw him quite clearly?


631
00:45:11.355 --> 00:45:13.982
I told you, as
clear as I see you.

632
00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:16.693
And this smell you imagined,
was it at the same time?


633
00:45:16.777 --> 00:45:18.278
Yes, it was particularly strong.

634
00:45:18.362 --> 00:45:20.114
- Was it a pleasant smell?
- Yes.


635
00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:22.783
- Could you place it?
- Fried onions.


636
00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:26.954
And this messenger,
he hasn't turned up again?


637
00:45:27.037 --> 00:45:28.205
- No, but he will.
- When?


638
00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:30.207
He picks his own time and stops it.

639
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.626
- Oh, Peter's lodged an appeal.
- Against what?


640
00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:35.587
- Against his call up.
- That's the spirit. Don't give in.


641
00:45:36.922 --> 00:45:38.006
I won't.

642
00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.509
I'm lucky that June knew you, Doctor.
Thank you for coming.


643
00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:42.386
June has lucky friends.

644
00:45:42.469 --> 00:45:44.721
- I've got bad news for you.
- Then why the grin?


645
00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:46.390
- You're going with me.
- Where to?


646
00:45:46.473 --> 00:45:47.975
To my house, for two reasons.

647
00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:50.727
First, I want to meet this chap
next time he drops in.


648
00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:52.688
Second,
I like a nice girl around the house,


649
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:54.940
and she only comes to see me
to borrow a book.


650
00:45:55.023 --> 00:45:57.234
- And she's a slow reader.
- What about my CO?


651
00:45:57.317 --> 00:46:02.156
I fixed it with him. Besides,
until we get this settled, I am your CO.


652
00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:04.324
And at my house,
you get your tea at half past 4:00.


653
00:46:04.408 --> 00:46:06.952
- Tea breaks!
- All right!


654
00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:09.079
Here you get it at 5:00.

655
00:46:10.706 --> 00:46:12.499
Sinkers, Doc?

656
00:46:12.583 --> 00:46:14.334
Thank you.

657
00:46:14.418 --> 00:46:16.795
We are shaping, Frank. 
We are shaping.

658
00:46:42.905 --> 00:46:44.907
Ha-ha! 20-all!

659
00:46:53.665 --> 00:46:54.958
Ah!

660
00:46:55.042 --> 00:46:56.210
21-20. Sorry.

661
00:46:56.293 --> 00:46:58.670
- You're sorry, my foot. Ready?
- Ready.


662
00:47:02.382 --> 00:47:03.383
Nearly.

663
00:47:03.467 --> 00:47:05.761
Nearly doesn't count. 21-all.

664
00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:09.431
- Up!
- I'll be.


665
00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:10.682
Count ten.

666
00:47:10.766 --> 00:47:13.852
- I wonder if Peter's a good player.
- You can ask him when he wakes.


667
00:47:13.936 --> 00:47:15.938
Well, he's been asleep
nearly two hours and a half.


668
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:17.523
- He'll wake at 11:00.
- How do you know?


669
00:47:17.606 --> 00:47:19.608
- I gave him a tablet.
- Well, how can you tell exactly?


670
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:21.527
I can't tell exactly,
but I know the patient.


671
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.111
- But do you know him?
- I think so.


672
00:47:23.195 --> 00:47:27.407
- Well, then tell me something about him.
- Are we playing table tennis, or are we not?


673
00:47:27.491 --> 00:47:29.368
- All right, your serve.
- Right. Ready?


674
00:47:29.451 --> 00:47:30.452
Ready.

675
00:47:31.203 --> 00:47:33.205
- Oh.
- Your game.


676
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:37.292
Now tell me what you think about him.

677
00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:40.212
- I think he's fascinating.
- So do I.


678
00:47:40.295 --> 00:47:42.047
Not biologically. Medically.

679
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.799
- Have a drink?
- Love one.


680
00:47:53.475 --> 00:47:55.894
What do the books say, Doc?

681
00:47:55.978 --> 00:47:58.355
I see a dark stranger in his life.

682
00:48:13.996 --> 00:48:16.665
Do you know what's wrong with him?

683
00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:18.834
Yes, I think I do.

684
00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:20.919
Is he going to be all right?

685
00:48:21.003 --> 00:48:23.005
He'll be all right. 
Here's your drink.

686
00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:26.800
Will he have any more hallucinations?

687
00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:28.719
- Yes.
- How do you know?


688
00:48:28.802 --> 00:48:31.471
Because this conductor
promised to come back.


689
00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:34.641
- Will that make him worse?
- Why should it?


690
00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:36.059
I don't know.

691
00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:40.522
Seeing things, arguing about his own life,
talking to a nonexistent man and -


692
00:48:40.606 --> 00:48:43.191
He does exist for him.

693
00:48:43.275 --> 00:48:46.153
He's not going mad then?
His brain isn't being affected?


694
00:48:46.236 --> 00:48:49.364
Of course it's being affected,
but not in the way you mean.


695
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.533
That's why I asked him
about his sense of smell.


696
00:48:51.617 --> 00:48:53.118
I saw it was important.

697
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:56.079
He's having a series
of highly organized hallucinations


698
00:48:56.163 --> 00:48:58.832
comparable to an experience
of actual life.


699
00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:02.461
A combination of vision,
of hearing, and of idea.


700
00:49:02.544 --> 00:49:04.963
To a neurologist,
that points to a direct connection


701
00:49:05.047 --> 00:49:07.049
with a sense of smell or of taste.

702
00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:10.385
Once that connection is established,
we know where to look for the trouble.


703
00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:12.971
I only want to find out one thing more
in his personal history,


704
00:49:13.055 --> 00:49:14.806
and I'll find that out later.

705
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.099
Now...

706
00:49:18.518 --> 00:49:20.812
- I'm not going to tell you any more.
- Thanks.


707
00:49:22.105 --> 00:49:24.566
But how did he survive the jump?

708
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.068
I don't know.

709
00:49:26.151 --> 00:49:28.737
If we could find that out and tell him,
it would save him.


710
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:32.574
It would help. But the main thing
is for him to win his case.


711
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.952
- Are you serious?
- Perfectly serious.


712
00:49:36.036 --> 00:49:38.705
- We must help him to win it.
- How?


713
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:41.708
It depends on what message
the conductor brings.


714
00:49:41.792 --> 00:49:44.711
But suppose he loses his case?

715
00:49:44.795 --> 00:49:46.338
Oh, that's absurd.

716
00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:49.007
If we see that he's losing
or we think he's going to lose,


717
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:51.259
we'll find out the reason why he survived.

718
00:49:51.343 --> 00:49:54.304
Or we'll invent one.
We'll have a couple of drinks, you and I.


719
00:49:54.388 --> 00:49:58.183
And we'll invent the greatest lie
in medical history.


720
00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:00.352
- Care for another game?
- I don't mind.


721
00:50:00.435 --> 00:50:02.479
Now, don't worry about him.
You see that bell?


722
00:50:02.562 --> 00:50:03.397
Yes.

723
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.440
He's promised to ring it
if he gets another visit.


724
00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:07.526
- Fine.
- Come on, your serve.


725
00:50:16.618 --> 00:50:18.203
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.


726
00:50:27.003 --> 00:50:28.630
One-love. Come up.

727
00:51:00.203 --> 00:51:02.122
Doc, he's here! June!

728
00:51:09.212 --> 00:51:10.130
Doc!

729
00:51:48.794 --> 00:51:52.088
<i>Eh bien, Mon Cher,</i>
<i>comment ça Va?</i>


730
00:51:52.172 --> 00:51:55.175
- Not too good.
- Hmm. Not too good, huh?


731
00:51:57.469 --> 00:52:00.806
I would not bother to ring that bell
if I were you. Nothing will happen.


732
00:52:00.889 --> 00:52:03.767
A little trick of mine, you remember?

733
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.479
After all, what is time?

734
00:52:19.449 --> 00:52:21.785
Only, uh, tyranny.

735
00:52:23.286 --> 00:52:25.789
Let me know if you're going
to do that again, won't you?


736
00:52:25.872 --> 00:52:28.166
- This looks good.
- Very good. Do you know the author?


737
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.294
- No, but I often have a game with Philidor.
- Philidor?


738
00:52:31.378 --> 00:52:33.088
The greatest master of chess
who ever lived.


739
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:36.716
A Frenchman, <i>naturellement.</i>
Come along and I'll introduce you.


740
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.176
- Good.
- Splendid.


741
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.470
No, I mean you've got
good news for me, my friend.


742
00:52:40.554 --> 00:52:41.847
How did you guess?

743
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.849
Well, you wouldn't try to entice me
with this Philimor -


744
00:52:43.932 --> 00:52:44.766
Philidor.

745
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.310
Philidor. If you had the right
to conduct me anyway.


746
00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:48.895
- True.
- Well?


747
00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:52.190
Speaking officially,
I have good news for you.


748
00:52:52.274 --> 00:52:53.275
Good.

749
00:52:53.358 --> 00:52:55.652
You are to be allowed to appeal
to the high court.


750
00:52:55.735 --> 00:52:56.570
Splendid.

751
00:52:56.653 --> 00:52:59.406
The trial will be a full-dress affair,
<i>très chic,</i> in three days,


752
00:52:59.489 --> 00:53:01.241
to give you time to prepare your case.

753
00:53:01.324 --> 00:53:02.951
- Better and better.
- Hmm.


754
00:53:03.034 --> 00:53:05.912
- Do not be too pleased.
- Why? Is there a catch?


755
00:53:05.996 --> 00:53:07.831
The prosecuting counsel.

756
00:53:07.914 --> 00:53:11.918
Of course, I am not permitted to offer advice
or give a personal opinion, but -


757
00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:14.379
- Who is this prosecuting counsel?
- Be prepared.


758
00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:15.672
- For what?
- A shock.


759
00:53:15.755 --> 00:53:17.757
Well, come on.
Tell me the worst. Who is it?


760
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:19.551
Abraham Farlan.

761
00:53:19.634 --> 00:53:21.511
- Come again?
- Abraham Farlan!


762
00:53:21.595 --> 00:53:23.138
- Well, I never heard of him.
- No?


763
00:53:23.221 --> 00:53:25.432
- Never in my life.
- He lives in Boston.


764
00:53:25.515 --> 00:53:27.517
- I've never been in Boston.
- Massachusetts?


765
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:29.102
I'd never been there.

766
00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:33.273
Abraham Farlan died in Boston in 1775.

767
00:53:33.356 --> 00:53:35.817
Does that date convey anything to you?

768
00:53:35.901 --> 00:53:38.820
- Lexington, Concord?
- Exactly. You are good at history.


769
00:53:38.904 --> 00:53:40.697
The American war of independence.

770
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.992
- Oh, he was killed?
- By a British bullet.


771
00:53:44.075 --> 00:53:46.494
Oh. He might be, uh, prejudiced.

772
00:53:46.578 --> 00:53:49.164
Hmm. He hates your guts.

773
00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:52.125
And he hates the guts of every Englishman.

774
00:53:52.208 --> 00:53:56.171
And particularly, he hates
this little affair with a Boston-born girl.


775
00:53:56.254 --> 00:53:57.756
It's not a little affair.

776
00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:01.051
A big affair.
He will hate you even more.


777
00:54:01.134 --> 00:54:03.303
- All right, I'll appeal against it.
- It will be no good.


778
00:54:03.386 --> 00:54:06.806
After all, we had to choose a good man.
The honor of the department was at stake.


779
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:10.018
No, what you have to do
is to choose a good man for yourself.


780
00:54:10.101 --> 00:54:11.811
- As defending counsel?
- Precisely.


781
00:54:11.895 --> 00:54:14.230
- Can I choose anybody?
- Anybody in the other world.


782
00:54:14.314 --> 00:54:16.358
Anybody who has ever lived upon Earth.

783
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:18.735
Everybody is at your disposal.

784
00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:20.445
You can choose me.

785
00:54:20.528 --> 00:54:22.864
- That would suit your book.
- But do not waste any time.


786
00:54:22.948 --> 00:54:25.617
Abraham Farlan
is piling up his case already.


787
00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.453
You can choose Socrates.
You can choose William Pitt.


788
00:54:28.536 --> 00:54:30.163
You can choose Henry VIII.

789
00:54:30.246 --> 00:54:34.668
Oh. Madame Du Barry.
She knows all about love.


790
00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:37.545
- Rather a one-track mind.
- You are a good chess player.


791
00:54:37.629 --> 00:54:38.838
Philidor.

792
00:54:38.922 --> 00:54:40.465
I'll think it over.

793
00:54:40.548 --> 00:54:43.593
By the way, I'd like to borrow this.

794
00:54:43.677 --> 00:54:46.471
- It's not mine. It belongs to the doctor.
- Oh, doctors.


795
00:54:46.554 --> 00:54:47.639
What about them?

796
00:54:47.722 --> 00:54:50.558
They give me a great deal
of trouble in my job.


797
00:54:57.399 --> 00:55:01.236
- He was here. He tricked us.
- Yes, he was... here.


798
00:55:03.363 --> 00:55:05.448
And these were on the floor.

799
00:55:05.532 --> 00:55:07.492
Peter, sit down.

800
00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:14.082
Now, look up.

801
00:55:15.083 --> 00:55:17.669
Yeah. You've been doing some hard talking.

802
00:55:17.752 --> 00:55:20.296
- I have.
- I hope you didn't give into anything.


803
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.007
- No.
- That's the spirit.


804
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.260
- Do you think I could stay overnight, Frank?
- Yes, I'll tell Mrs. Tucker.


805
00:55:25.343 --> 00:55:27.887
- I don't need anything much.
- Now, let's see.


806
00:55:30.598 --> 00:55:33.059
Hmm. I'll tell Mrs. 
Tucker you're staying.

807
00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:34.352
- Dr. Reeves?
- Yes?


808
00:55:34.436 --> 00:55:36.896
Can I stay in here?
I want to be near these books.


809
00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.399
Of course. I'll fix up a camp bed.

810
00:55:40.817 --> 00:55:42.694
- Great news, darling.
- What, sweet?


811
00:55:42.777 --> 00:55:44.904
- I'm to be allowed to appeal.
- Really?


812
00:55:44.988 --> 00:55:46.990
Oh, June, I don't want to leave you.

813
00:55:47.073 --> 00:55:50.744
Darling, why should you leave me?
Everything will be all right.


814
00:55:50.827 --> 00:55:53.496
- Well, if I can get a good counsel.
- Of course you will.


815
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.499
It's very important.
I - I don't want to lose you.


816
00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.960
Darling, I don't intend to let you go.

817
00:55:59.044 --> 00:56:01.129
No one can take you from me.
I won't let them.


818
00:56:01.212 --> 00:56:02.213
It's no good, you see?

819
00:56:02.297 --> 00:56:05.091
A judgment against me will be backed up
by all of the power of this world


820
00:56:05.175 --> 00:56:06.843
and of the other.

821
00:56:08.344 --> 00:56:09.846
Drink this.

822
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:13.224
- Peter's got the right to appeal.
- Splendid.


823
00:56:13.308 --> 00:56:14.976
- Did you smell anything?
- Yes.


824
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.478
- The same? Fried onions?
- Yes.


825
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:18.855
Good. Drink that up.

826
00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:20.482
- Any headache?
- Hmm.


827
00:56:21.399 --> 00:56:24.402
- You can tell me tomorrow what he said.
- No. He said -


828
00:56:25.945 --> 00:56:27.655
- Good heavens.
- What is it?


829
00:56:27.739 --> 00:56:29.741
- He's got my <i>Hundred Best Games.</i>
- What?


830
00:56:29.824 --> 00:56:32.410
Alekhine's chess book, <i>Hundred Best Games.</i>
Are you sure?


831
00:56:32.494 --> 00:56:34.829
Absolutely certain. He had it in his hand.
What a nerve.


832
00:56:34.913 --> 00:56:37.415
A bit cold. Now,
how about getting to bed?

833
00:56:37.499 --> 00:56:39.000
I want to talk to you first.
It's important.


834
00:56:39.084 --> 00:56:42.587
No, not now. Have a long sleep.
Tomorrow you'll feel as fresh as a daisy.


835
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.423
It's about my counsel. I don't think
you believe a word of what I say.


836
00:56:45.507 --> 00:56:46.716
Of course we do.

837
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.178
My dear friend, here on Earth,
I am your defending counsel,


838
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:53.473
and as your counsel,
I believe everything you tell me.


839
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:04.734
Uh, hello, Dr. Gaertler.

840
00:57:04.818 --> 00:57:07.403
Why, hello, Dr. Reeves.
You make your rounds the hard way.


841
00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:09.489
- Give me a coupe anytime.
- Is Dr. McEwen free?


842
00:57:09.572 --> 00:57:10.990
- He's just going to operate.
- Oh.


843
00:57:11.074 --> 00:57:13.993
He hasn't started yet. I'll tell him.
I imagine he'll see you in the washroom.


844
00:57:14.077 --> 00:57:15.453
Thanks.

845
00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:42.939
- Hello, Frank. What's new?
- Deterioration all around.


846
00:57:43.022 --> 00:57:45.650
- We ought to operate tonight.
- That's impossible. We're swamped.


847
00:57:45.733 --> 00:57:48.653
- Are you sure of your diagnosis?
- Certain. I discovered the missing fact.


848
00:57:48.736 --> 00:57:51.406
He had slight concussion two years ago
with no aftereffects.


849
00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:54.159
The X-ray is inconclusive.
You'll see in the ocular reports.


850
00:57:54.242 --> 00:57:56.536
You know all about these
highly organized hallucinations


851
00:57:56.619 --> 00:57:58.204
coupled with a sense of smell.

852
00:57:58.288 --> 00:58:02.167
Everything points to arachnoid adhesions
involving the olfactory nerve in the brain.


853
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.335
It's a tricky operation,
but I've never seen one.


854
00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:07.422
I have. Several
at the Hospital de la Pitié in Paris.


855
00:58:07.505 --> 00:58:09.757
I've made some notes, so I wonder
if the surgeon could see them.


856
00:58:09.841 --> 00:58:12.510
Sure. It'll be Dr. Liza.
He's a very fine neurosurgeon.


857
00:58:12.594 --> 00:58:16.055
- Liza. A good man.
- I don't see how we can manage tonight.


858
00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:18.600
There's no crisis in such a thing.
Any day will do.


859
00:58:18.683 --> 00:58:20.101
No, it won't.

860
00:58:20.185 --> 00:58:23.021
And I'll tell you why I think it won't
and why there is a crisis.


861
00:58:23.104 --> 00:58:25.523
I'm afraid of his brain
being permanently affected.


862
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:27.901
- Insanity?
- Yes.


863
00:58:27.984 --> 00:58:28.943
Why?

864
00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:33.281
Because his trial is fixed for tonight
and he hasn't found anyone to defend him yet.


865
00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:36.201
He spends all his time in my library
or in talks with me and the girl.


866
00:58:36.284 --> 00:58:38.411
He only sleeps when I drug him.

867
00:58:38.494 --> 00:58:41.080
The boy has a fine mind,
but it's a little taxed.


868
00:58:41.164 --> 00:58:43.625
That's the trouble. 
It's too good a mind.

869
00:58:43.708 --> 00:58:46.085
A weak mind isn't strong enough
to hurt itself.


870
00:58:46.169 --> 00:58:48.713
Stupidity has saved many a man
from going mad.


871
00:58:48.796 --> 00:58:50.173
Yes, you're right there.

872
00:58:50.256 --> 00:58:53.927
And he's had several talks
with this heavenly messenger.


873
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:57.889
Hallucinations, of course,
but you never saw such an imagination.


874
00:58:57.972 --> 00:59:02.268
I've been taking tips on the other world -
laws, system, architecture.


875
00:59:02.352 --> 00:59:03.561
Here's the interesting point.

876
00:59:03.645 --> 00:59:05.939
He never steps outside the limits
of his own imagination.


877
00:59:06.022 --> 00:59:09.484
- I don't quite get you.
- Nothing he invents is entirely fantastic.


878
00:59:09.567 --> 00:59:12.278
It's invention, but logical invention.

879
00:59:12.362 --> 00:59:16.449
And the keystone to his invention
is that the trial takes place tonight.


880
00:59:16.532 --> 00:59:19.118
He must win or lose his case tonight,

881
00:59:19.202 --> 00:59:21.204
and that's why I think
we ought to operate tonight.


882
00:59:21.287 --> 00:59:24.249
It's no use shaking your head, and that's
why I think we ought to find a counsel


883
00:59:24.332 --> 00:59:27.001
to save him from losing his case,
or we may lose him.


884
00:59:45.979 --> 00:59:49.524
What about... him?

885
00:59:51.234 --> 00:59:55.280
Lincoln?
No, it's hardly fair to drag him in.


886
00:59:55.363 --> 00:59:56.990
I don't believe he'd be prejudiced.

887
00:59:59.742 --> 01:00:01.035
Plato.

888
01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:04.539
How would you like
to be defended by Plato?


889
01:00:04.622 --> 01:00:07.458
Nobody knew more
about reasoning than Plato.


890
01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.712
He was 81 when he died.
He might be too old to think love important.


891
01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:12.255
You think so?

892
01:00:12.338 --> 01:00:15.216
Anyhow, Plato had
very elementary ideas about love.


893
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.845
Besides, didn't he quote Sophocles

894
01:00:18.928 --> 01:00:21.556
when somebody asked him
if he was still able to appreciate a woman?


895
01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:22.974
What did the old boy say?

896
01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:26.269
Well, he said, uh,
"I'm only too glad to be rid of all of that.


897
01:00:26.352 --> 01:00:28.688
It's like escaping from bondage
to a raving madman."


898
01:00:30.023 --> 01:00:32.775
These Greeks - cold as their marble.

899
01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:34.360
Now, if he had been French.

900
01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:37.780
Richelieu, for example.
Irresistible at 80.


901
01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:40.158
How about Richelieu?

902
01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:42.618
I never liked him much
since <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>


903
01:00:53.046 --> 01:00:55.381
Solomon.

904
01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:57.592
Solomon.

905
01:00:58.217 --> 01:00:59.677
No?

906
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:02.096
<i>Mais, tonnerre de Dieu,</i> who do you want?

907
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.723
You have only a few hours left.

908
01:01:03.806 --> 01:01:07.894
Look, it sounds a grand idea to have
all these great men to choose from,


909
01:01:07.977 --> 01:01:11.064
but what did they know
of our problems today?


910
01:01:11.147 --> 01:01:12.857
True. Very little.

911
01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.193
Besides, I think it ought
to be an Englishman.


912
01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:20.573
Nobody famous, but somebody
with his head screwed on all right.


913
01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:23.159
Screwed?

914
01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:25.119
Now, this Abraham, um -

915
01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:27.705
- Farlan.
- Farlan. Was he a famous man?


916
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:30.291
He was the first American
to be killed by a British bullet.


917
01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:33.169
No. I don't mean that. I mean, was he
a great philosopher or statesman?


918
01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:36.506
- He was a schoolteacher.
- There, you see.


919
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:42.345
Now, Plato would probably talk
about perceptions and causations.


920
01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:43.471
Pardon?

921
01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:46.391
- Over your head too?
- Definitely.


922
01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:48.476
Well, it's quite simple.

923
01:01:51.687 --> 01:01:56.401
By the way, why are you so interested
in my winning my case?


924
01:01:56.484 --> 01:01:57.610
I?

925
01:01:57.693 --> 01:01:59.112
Yes, you.

926
01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:09.622
And why am I
being taken up this stairway?

927
01:02:13.751 --> 01:02:15.920
I'm not being taken for a ride,
am I, by any chance?


928
01:02:16.003 --> 01:02:18.881
- What a suggestion.
- Take that bit of barley sugar away.


929
01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:20.925
I don't like it,
and I don't like your suggestions.


930
01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:22.927
I think I'll go
back before it's too late.

931
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.263
Peter. Peter!

932
01:02:25.346 --> 01:02:27.098
Peter!

933
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:28.641
Peter.

934
01:02:28.724 --> 01:02:32.270
<i>Peter, Ne soyez pas bête!</i> Peter!

935
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:37.400
Peter, come back.

936
01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:41.362
Peter. Peter, come back!

937
01:02:41.446 --> 01:02:42.822
Peter.

938
01:02:42.905 --> 01:02:44.740
Peter, come back!

939
01:02:46.367 --> 01:02:47.702
Peter!

940
01:02:47.785 --> 01:02:49.787
Peter, come back!

941
01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:52.582
Peter, come back!

942
01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:56.711
Peter! Peter, come back!

943
01:02:58.421 --> 01:03:01.716
Peter! Peter, come back!

944
01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:05.178
Peter! Peter, come back!

945
01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:06.971
Peter! Peter!

946
01:03:07.972 --> 01:03:10.057
Peter, my darling, come back to me.

947
01:03:18.024 --> 01:03:19.942
He almost got me.

948
01:03:49.805 --> 01:03:52.391
He'll be all right in a moment.
Why isn't the ambulance here?


949
01:03:52.475 --> 01:03:53.976
It was due half an hour ago.

950
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.854
Go and phone Dr. McEwen.
Tell him we must operate tonight.


951
01:03:56.938 --> 01:03:59.023
It's life or death.
And tell him about the ambulance.


952
01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:00.191
Yes, Doctor.

953
01:04:00.274 --> 01:04:02.485
Send a telegram to his mother.
He's got two sisters too.


954
01:04:02.568 --> 01:04:04.278
- Yes, Doctor.
- That's all.


955
01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.368
- Now, Peter -
- Where's June?


956
01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:12.078
Phoning. Back in a moment.

957
01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:13.996
- He almost got me.
- I know.


958
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.666
He's a crafty beggar.
I only got away by the skin of my teeth.


959
01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:19.794
Now look here, don't let anybody
fool you into giving up this case.


960
01:04:19.877 --> 01:04:22.255
You've been allowed to appeal.
You've been promised a fair trial.


961
01:04:22.338 --> 01:04:25.341
- Don't give in to anybody. Promise?
- I've got no counsel.


962
01:04:25.424 --> 01:04:28.427
We'll find the right man. They can't
start your trial without your counsel.


963
01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.721
- They might appoint some stooge.
- Nonsense.


964
01:04:30.805 --> 01:04:33.432
- Or let it go by default.
- I tell you, we'll find somebody.


965
01:04:33.516 --> 01:04:35.476
They can't start till then.

966
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.395
Nobody famous.

967
01:04:37.478 --> 01:04:39.689
No, that would be
the worst thing we could do.


968
01:04:39.772 --> 01:04:42.233
- How about a pal of yours?
- We might find somebody.


969
01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:44.068
What about your radio operator?

970
01:04:44.151 --> 01:04:45.903
- Bob?
- Yes, think it over.


971
01:04:47.363 --> 01:04:48.990
- You couldn't get through?
- They don't answer.


972
01:04:49.073 --> 01:04:51.325
It's the storm, Mr. Frank.
They always cut the telephone off.


973
01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.411
- I'll go on my bike.
- No, one of us must go.


974
01:04:53.494 --> 01:04:55.454
Look, you're more valuable here.

975
01:04:55.538 --> 01:04:58.207
Now, if the ambulance comes,
don't wait for me.


976
01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.751
And if I meet it, I'll come back.
Now, go to him.


977
01:05:00.835 --> 01:05:03.921
Don't allow him to despair.
His life is in your hands.


978
01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:33.826
- Where's Frank?
- He won't be long, darling.


979
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.454
I must talk to him.

980
01:05:36.537 --> 01:05:40.750
- I don't think Bob's the right man.
- I'll tell him you said so.


981
01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.335
- Do you know Bob?
- No.


982
01:05:43.002 --> 01:05:45.796
He was my sparks.

983
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.423
Highly operational type.

984
01:05:47.506 --> 01:05:49.008
We'll find somebody.

985
01:05:51.177 --> 01:05:52.887
Time's nearly up.

986
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:56.057
- Frank will come up with something.
- I wish he'd hurry.


987
01:06:04.106 --> 01:06:05.149
Look out!

988
01:06:14.575 --> 01:06:16.535
Dr. Reeves!

989
01:06:21.832 --> 01:06:23.542
- Get the fire extinguishers!
- Okay, sir!


990
01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:25.127
- And the blankets!
- Right!


991
01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:35.763
- Can I help you, sir?
- Watch the road.


992
01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:06.627
He never saw us
until it was too late.

993
01:07:06.711 --> 01:07:08.796
He turned off to save us.

994
01:07:09.547 --> 01:07:12.174
Gosh, I feel bad about it.
He was a fine man.


995
01:07:12.258 --> 01:07:14.427
You couldn't help it.

996
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:16.637
He was interested in this case, wasn't he?

997
01:07:17.805 --> 01:07:20.975
- Yes.
- I saw his notes he left for Dr. Liza.


998
01:07:21.058 --> 01:07:23.102
It was a fine piece of diagnosis.

999
01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:25.396
He left notes for the operation too.

1000
01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:28.107
- Dr. Liza is very good, isn't he?
- The best.


1001
01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:33.529
Frank?

1002
01:07:35.948 --> 01:07:37.032
I'm here, darling.

1003
01:07:39.034 --> 01:07:40.035
Where's Frank?

1004
01:07:43.873 --> 01:07:45.374
He's gone ahead.

1005
01:07:50.504 --> 01:07:52.590
He's had an accident.

1006
01:07:56.552 --> 01:07:58.179
Hasn't he?

1007
01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:03.225
Yes, a bad accident.

1008
01:08:08.522 --> 01:08:09.940
Is he dead?

1009
01:08:12.485 --> 01:08:14.195
Yes, he's dead.

1010
01:08:31.545 --> 01:08:33.547
All right, boys. Step lively.

1011
01:08:35.925 --> 01:08:38.135
Okay, Doc. His hand.

1012
01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:40.971
- Easy.
- All right.


1013
01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.890
Easy down there.

1014
01:08:47.019 --> 01:08:49.188
- All right, Johnny. Take it away.
- Okay.


1015
01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:26.559
- An atropine injection, Sister?
- Yes, a hundredth.


1016
01:09:26.642 --> 01:09:29.270
- Is this the cranial case?
- Yes, that's right.


1017
01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:34.191
Hello, Squadron Leader.
We're all ready for you.


1018
01:11:18.003 --> 01:11:19.672
- Dr. Reeves?
- Yes.


1019
01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:22.299
Permit me to return your book.

1020
01:11:22.383 --> 01:11:23.801
- Oh-ho!
- Aha!


1021
01:11:23.884 --> 01:11:27.054
- So, it's you?
- I will introduce you to Philidor.


1022
01:11:27.137 --> 01:11:29.932
<i>Cher collègue,</i>
this is a special case. Court of Appeal.


1023
01:11:30.015 --> 01:11:33.352
- I will undertake to deliver Dr. Reeves.
- As you wish.


1024
01:11:34.228 --> 01:11:35.646
<i>Merci.</i>

1025
01:11:38.649 --> 01:11:40.818
- Be of good cheer, friend.
- Thank you.


1026
01:11:40.901 --> 01:11:43.237
One of the best men in the service,
a compatriot of yours.


1027
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.905
- What's his name?
- Oh, John -


1028
01:11:44.989 --> 01:11:46.490
Bunyan. Yes, of course.

1029
01:11:46.573 --> 01:11:49.743
And how is dear Peter?

1030
01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:52.621
Oh, he has a fighting chance.

1031
01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:54.206
Oh-ho.

1032
01:12:01.588 --> 01:12:03.674
- Dr. Frank Reeves?
- Yes.


1033
01:12:04.383 --> 01:12:06.635
You're familiar with the case
of Squadron Leader Carter?


1034
01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:08.345
I am.

1035
01:12:08.429 --> 01:12:12.808
- He has chosen you to be his counsel.
- I hoped he would.


1036
01:12:12.891 --> 01:12:14.643
- Do you accept?
- I do.


1037
01:12:14.727 --> 01:12:17.438
You have very little time
in which to prepare your case.


1038
01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:20.190
What facilities do you wish?

1039
01:12:20.274 --> 01:12:23.277
I should like to see my client
and get his instructions.


1040
01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:26.280
And I subpoena
Flying Officer Trubshawe as a witness.


1041
01:12:26.363 --> 01:12:29.283
Certainly. Conductor 71.

1042
01:12:29.366 --> 01:12:32.619
You will take Dr. Frank Reeves
to Squadron Leader Carter.


1043
01:12:58.312 --> 01:13:01.148
Psst. Peter. Peter.

1044
01:13:29.718 --> 01:13:31.553
- Hello, Bob.
- What ho, Skipper.


1045
01:13:31.637 --> 01:13:33.889
I didn't expect to see you here.
Not yet anyway.


1046
01:13:33.972 --> 01:13:35.682
Not up there either.

1047
01:13:35.766 --> 01:13:38.602
- Well, it was Doc Reeves' idea.
- I subpoenaed him. Let's talk.


1048
01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:40.062
Right.

1049
01:13:40.145 --> 01:13:43.524
- You sure they won't miss me?
- Miss you? You know me, <i>Mon ami.</i>


1050
01:13:44.858 --> 01:13:47.778
That surgeon's very neat.
Very neat indeed.


1051
01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:50.114
I like his work.
You're in good hands, Peter.


1052
01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:51.365
I know.

1053
01:13:51.448 --> 01:13:53.242
- Now, look here.
- I know what's coming.


1054
01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:55.786
Yes, I'm very flattered,
but are you sure I'm the best man?


1055
01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:56.703
Quite sure.

1056
01:13:56.787 --> 01:13:58.956
Aren't you afraid that I may be
out of my depths up there?


1057
01:13:59.039 --> 01:13:59.873
No.

1058
01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.834
- Well, doesn't it worry you I'm no lawyer?
- No.


1059
01:14:01.917 --> 01:14:03.961
- If he gets onto politics, I'm sunk.
- Who isn't?


1060
01:14:04.044 --> 01:14:07.214
- Come on, Frank. You must have something.
- Oh, just a little common sense.


1061
01:14:07.297 --> 01:14:09.842
And if it's as rare up there
as it is down here, it'll do me.


1062
01:14:09.925 --> 01:14:11.135
- Say yes.
- Well -


1063
01:14:11.218 --> 01:14:13.929
- He has no choice anyhow.
- What are we talking about then?


1064
01:14:14.012 --> 01:14:16.431
All right. I need evidence.

1065
01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:24.064
Look at her.

1066
01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:26.567
Holy smoke!

1067
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:27.943
Well -

1068
01:14:28.026 --> 01:14:31.196
- She looks like a nice girl.
- She is a nice girl.


1069
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.407
Hardly your type, Skip.

1070
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.826
I've fallen in love with her.

1071
01:14:35.909 --> 01:14:39.913
Her accent is foreign,
but it sounds sweet to me.


1072
01:14:41.665 --> 01:14:46.086
We were born thousands of miles apart...
but we were made for each other.


1073
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:47.796
That's an excellent piece of prose.

1074
01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:52.843
- Sorry.
- Nothing to be ashamed of.


1075
01:14:53.719 --> 01:14:55.554
May I kiss her,
just in case, you know?

1076
01:14:55.637 --> 01:14:57.890
Okay, you may, but
she will not know it.

1077
01:14:58.432 --> 01:15:00.142
It doesn't matter.

1078
01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:03.103
Oh, he's English.

1079
01:15:03.187 --> 01:15:06.440
What is the good of kissing a girl
if she does not feel it?


1080
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.659
- Look.
- What?


1081
01:15:17.743 --> 01:15:20.037
The evidence you wanted.

1082
01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.830
Her tears.

1083
01:15:23.624 --> 01:15:25.542
Oh, I wish I
could take one with me.

1084
01:15:25.626 --> 01:15:28.045
You are counsel. 
You can do as you wish.

1085
01:15:28.128 --> 01:15:31.173
I say, why don't we wrap it up
and take it with us?


1086
01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:33.759
Permit me.

1087
01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:45.187
That's it.
The only real bit of evidence we have.


1088
01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:49.524
Quick. We must not keep the court waiting.

1089
01:18:18.215 --> 01:18:20.592
The court of appeal sits
to consider the case


1090
01:18:20.675 --> 01:18:22.302
of the <i>Department of Records</i>

1091
01:18:22.386 --> 01:18:26.264
<i>versus Squadron Leader Peter David Carter</i>
<i>of the Royal Air Force.</i>


1092
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.017
He claims negligence

1093
01:18:29.101 --> 01:18:32.604
and superior rights and responsibilities
arising out of that negligence.


1094
01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:37.526
He is appealing for remission
of the date of his term on Earth


1095
01:18:37.609 --> 01:18:40.112
and for a reconsideration of his case.

1096
01:18:40.946 --> 01:18:43.365
It has been decided to allow this appeal.

1097
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:46.493
It is for the jury to decide
whether it shall be successful.


1098
01:18:48.662 --> 01:18:50.831
Owing to the Interest aroused by the case,

1099
01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:53.542
there is an unusually large audience.

1100
01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.170
We can, of course, seat everyone
who wishes to be present,


1101
01:18:58.046 --> 01:19:01.800
but the front rows have been reserved for those
who have a special interest in the case.


1102
01:19:02.676 --> 01:19:05.011
Members of the jury,

1103
01:19:05.095 --> 01:19:09.224
do not allow yourselves to be influenced
by anything but the facts


1104
01:19:09.307 --> 01:19:10.892
and by your conscience.

1105
01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:15.439
You will have every assistance from the court
to help you to arrive at your verdict.


1106
01:19:17.774 --> 01:19:20.277
The counsel for the prosecution
will take his place.


1107
01:19:46.928 --> 01:19:49.306
The counsel for the defense
will take his place.


1108
01:19:58.565 --> 01:20:01.234
I call upon the prosecution
to open the case.


1109
01:20:06.072 --> 01:20:09.284
Your Honor, members of the jury,

1110
01:20:09.367 --> 01:20:11.828
this case has three issues.

1111
01:20:11.912 --> 01:20:14.998
Peter D. Carter, an Englishman,

1112
01:20:15.081 --> 01:20:18.793
should have died
on the second day of May, 1945,


1113
01:20:18.877 --> 01:20:21.254
at ten after 4:00 of the clock.

1114
01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:23.965
British double summertime.

1115
01:20:24.049 --> 01:20:29.304
Due to an oversight, which I hasten to state
is contrary to the traditions of a great service...


1116
01:20:31.306 --> 01:20:33.600
the defendant did not die.

1117
01:20:33.683 --> 01:20:37.729
Therefore, issue number one,
who is responsible?


1118
01:20:37.812 --> 01:20:40.482
When summoned to report
some 20-odd hours later,


1119
01:20:40.565 --> 01:20:43.485
the defendant refused
to accompany Conductor 71,


1120
01:20:43.568 --> 01:20:47.739
giving, as his reason,
that in the time, which he had borrowed,


1121
01:20:47.822 --> 01:20:49.783
he had accumulated new responsibilities

1122
01:20:49.866 --> 01:20:53.411
of an allegedly important
and permanent nature.


1123
01:20:53.495 --> 01:20:57.999
He claimed, in fact,
that in these 20 hours,


1124
01:20:58.083 --> 01:21:02.837
a young lady of good American stock
had fallen in love with him.


1125
01:21:03.964 --> 01:21:06.633
Therefore, issue number two,

1126
01:21:06.716 --> 01:21:08.927
are we to believe this?

1127
01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:13.223
Furthermore, he states that
in these 20 hours, which he had borrowed -


1128
01:21:13.306 --> 01:21:18.311
My lord, I object to the word "borrowed,"
which counsel is using so emphatically.


1129
01:21:18.395 --> 01:21:20.939
To borrow means
to get temporary use of something,


1130
01:21:21.022 --> 01:21:22.899
to use something
without being the true owner.


1131
01:21:22.983 --> 01:21:25.193
My client didn't get.

1132
01:21:25.277 --> 01:21:27.821
He was given the 20 hours in question.

1133
01:21:27.904 --> 01:21:30.615
He didn't use something
without being the true owner.


1134
01:21:30.699 --> 01:21:32.576
He was the true
owner of his own life.

1135
01:21:34.202 --> 01:21:37.664
The next points are,
is this young Englishman in love


1136
01:21:37.747 --> 01:21:40.542
with this young lady
of good American stock?


1137
01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:43.837
And even more important this,
is she in love with him?


1138
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:46.423
Why do you stress their nationalities?

1139
01:21:46.506 --> 01:21:49.175
Very important, sir. 
Extremely important.

1140
01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:52.554
- Why?
- Because we are talking of love, sir.


1141
01:21:52.637 --> 01:21:55.807
It can happen, you know, between
an Englishman and an American girl.


1142
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.310
And, uh, vice versa.

1143
01:21:58.393 --> 01:22:00.395
Possibly.

1144
01:22:00.478 --> 01:22:03.773
But what are these love affairs,
Dr. Reeves?


1145
01:22:03.857 --> 01:22:06.985
Men and women,
thousands of miles away from home,


1146
01:22:07.068 --> 01:22:10.196
away from the love they left behind.

1147
01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.199
Minute sparks instead of scorching flames.

1148
01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:18.079
Fading shabby wigs
instead of the rich gold of a woman's hair.


1149
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.791
The love of the moment, Dr. Reeves.

1150
01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:24.127
Do I call it love?

1151
01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:26.171
Once in a thousand times, perhaps.

1152
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.549
And how many end in lasting marriage?

1153
01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:31.134
One in 10,000.

1154
01:22:31.718 --> 01:22:34.763
My case, sir.
That, sir, is for you to prove.


1155
01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.349
When in the course of human events,

1156
01:22:37.432 --> 01:22:39.643
our men and women came
to your country as your allies,


1157
01:22:39.726 --> 01:22:41.353
it was not to become your prisoners.

1158
01:22:41.436 --> 01:22:45.482
Sir, may I bring you up to date?
We're living in the 20th century, not in the 18th.


1159
01:22:45.565 --> 01:22:48.193
May I bring you up to date, sir?

1160
01:22:48.276 --> 01:22:50.445
We are not alive at all.

1161
01:22:50.528 --> 01:22:52.364
A point.

1162
01:22:53.031 --> 01:22:55.075
And I am up to date, sir.

1163
01:22:55.158 --> 01:22:58.078
I've been watching you English
from upstairs.


1164
01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:00.580
Your wars, your politics, your business.

1165
01:23:01.373 --> 01:23:04.876
From the tax on tea in 1766

1166
01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:06.753
to a certain report on England

1167
01:23:06.836 --> 01:23:10.507
by five members
of the United States Senate in 1944.


1168
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.927
The defendant has nothing to do
with tea nor senators.


1169
01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:16.971
But other Englishmen had, sir.

1170
01:23:17.055 --> 01:23:20.684
Is Peter D. Carter what you would call
a good Englishman, sir?


1171
01:23:20.767 --> 01:23:22.477
Yes, sir.

1172
01:23:23.478 --> 01:23:25.480
Do you see this glass?

1173
01:23:25.563 --> 01:23:29.109
Out of it Benedict Arnold
drank the health of King George Ill.


1174
01:23:31.861 --> 01:23:35.031
Does it break because it is faulty
or because it is glass?


1175
01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:39.744
Can I tear this piece of paper
because it is defective


1176
01:23:39.828 --> 01:23:41.788
or because it is paper?

1177
01:23:41.871 --> 01:23:44.290
We are all as God made us, sir.

1178
01:23:44.374 --> 01:23:47.961
But our ancestors had a deal to do
in the shaping us, as well.


1179
01:23:48.044 --> 01:23:51.089
I quite agree.
The jury will please note that.


1180
01:23:51.172 --> 01:23:55.051
My lord, may I ask where Mr. Farlan's
grandfather was born?


1181
01:23:55.135 --> 01:23:56.761
Your Honor, the question is irrelevant.

1182
01:23:56.845 --> 01:23:58.638
Could it have been in England?

1183
01:23:58.722 --> 01:24:00.932
You need not answer that question,
Mr. Farlan.


1184
01:24:01.015 --> 01:24:04.018
But I prefer to answer, Your Honor.

1185
01:24:04.102 --> 01:24:06.688
My grandfather left England, sir,
because he didn't like it.


1186
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.733
And Granddad would have liked it
even less today.


1187
01:24:11.025 --> 01:24:12.485
Listen.

1188
01:24:12.902 --> 01:24:14.738
<i>Well, here we are at Lord's.</i>

1189
01:24:14.821 --> 01:24:17.824
The voice of England in 1945.

1190
01:24:19.075 --> 01:24:22.787
<i>And here, let me say, that the weather</i>
<i>is much more like cricket weather now.</i>


1191
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:26.833
<i>It's stopped raining.</i>
<i>Play has been resumed.</i>


1192
01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:29.878
<i>And the crowd of, I say,</i>
<i>about 50, 000 people</i>


1193
01:24:29.961 --> 01:24:32.547
<i>have discarded their macs and umbrellas</i>

1194
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:34.841
<i>and settled down to enjoy the game,</i>

1195
01:24:34.924 --> 01:24:37.135
which, to people all over the world,

1196
01:24:37.218 --> 01:24:39.721
<i>is perhaps more truly representative</i>

1197
01:24:39.804 --> 01:24:41.806
<i>of all that's typically English</i>

1198
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:43.516
<i>than anything else.</i>

1199
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.894
Do you admit that this
is an English voice, sir?


1200
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:51.608
<i>That was Wally Hammond</i>
<i>who played a delightful 14-shot off Miller -</i>


1201
01:24:57.447 --> 01:25:00.158
The voice of America in 1945.

1202
01:25:00.241 --> 01:25:02.577
♪ <i>Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby ♪</i>

1203

1204

1206

1208
01:25:22.388 --> 01:25:25.433

1209
01:25:26.559 --> 01:25:30.396

1210
01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.273

1211
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:35.193
Nor do I.

1212
01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:37.737
<i>♪ To say good-bye this way ♪</i>

1213
01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:42.534
But, for England, I am ready to call
John Donne, Dryden, Pope,


1214
01:25:42.617 --> 01:25:45.370
Wordsworth and Coleridge,
Shelley and Keats,


1215
01:25:45.453 --> 01:25:47.705
Tennyson, Bridges.

1216
01:25:47.789 --> 01:25:50.250
And Milton and Shakespeare.
I concede your point.


1217
01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:52.627
And you've already called Peter Carter.

1218
01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:55.463
- Is he a poet?
- He will be, if you give him time.


1219
01:25:55.547 --> 01:25:57.966
We are here to decide that, sir.

1220
01:25:58.049 --> 01:26:04.097
I can't deny it.

1221
01:26:49.684 --> 01:26:52.312
Can the new world return to the old?

1222
01:26:53.062 --> 01:26:56.107
Should the vibrant humor
of a young American girl


1223
01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.735
be stifled in the pages of <i>Punch</i>?

1224
01:26:59.944 --> 01:27:02.739
Should the swift tempo of her life
be slowed


1225
01:27:02.822 --> 01:27:04.657
to the crawl of a match at cricket?

1226
01:27:05.491 --> 01:27:08.494
Should her accustomed native comfort
per force conform


1227
01:27:08.578 --> 01:27:11.831
to England's warm drinks, cold rooms,

1228
01:27:11.915 --> 01:27:15.168
drafty windows, smoky chimneys,
faulty plumbing?


1229
01:27:15.251 --> 01:27:17.170
Two million houses have no windows at all,

1230
01:27:17.253 --> 01:27:19.589
and frequently the roof and walls
have gone with the windows.


1231
01:27:19.672 --> 01:27:21.633
My lord,
I submit that this court is concerned


1232
01:27:21.716 --> 01:27:23.217
with the life and death of Peter Carter,

1233
01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:26.179
and not with past history
or prison plumbing.


1234
01:27:26.262 --> 01:27:28.014
Hear! Hear!

1235
01:27:28.097 --> 01:27:31.601
But Peter Carter's character, sir,
like every other human being,


1236
01:27:31.684 --> 01:27:35.605
has been formed by circumstance,
by a chain of circumstances.


1237
01:27:36.731 --> 01:27:40.068
As Benjamin Franklin said,
"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.


1238
01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:43.237
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.
For want of a horse, the rider was lost.


1239
01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:46.824
For want of a rider, the message was lost.
For want of a message, the kingdom was lost.


1240
01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:49.827
And all for the
want of a horseshoe nail."

1241
01:27:51.496 --> 01:27:54.123
You've heard of Benjamin Franklin, sir?

1242
01:27:54.207 --> 01:27:57.168
I beg you, in George Washington's words,

1243
01:27:57.251 --> 01:27:59.087
"Labor to keep alive in your breast

1244
01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:02.590
that little spark of celestial fire
called conscience."


1245
01:28:03.132 --> 01:28:05.385
That could not have been said
by an Englishman, sir.


1246
01:28:05.468 --> 01:28:07.470
What was George Washington?

1247
01:28:08.638 --> 01:28:10.014
Conscience, Mr. Farlan.

1248
01:28:10.098 --> 01:28:14.018
Are you insinuating, sir, that something
is wrong with my conscience?


1249
01:28:14.102 --> 01:28:15.853
- I am.
- Your Honor, I protest.


1250
01:28:15.937 --> 01:28:19.774
I'm only trying to give a full picture
of this case to the jury.


1251
01:28:19.857 --> 01:28:22.652
You are trying to prejudice the jury, sir.

1252
01:28:22.735 --> 01:28:26.739
I see that they've been selected
from many races, creeds, and nationalities.


1253
01:28:26.823 --> 01:28:29.325
I cannot believe them interested
in ancient grudges


1254
01:28:29.409 --> 01:28:31.244
against Peter Carter's ancestors,

1255
01:28:31.327 --> 01:28:33.955
nor in present grumblings
about drafty windows.


1256
01:28:34.038 --> 01:28:35.957
I don't need to prejudice the jury, sir.

1257
01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.002
They're already prejudiced against
your country, and with good reason.


1258
01:28:39.085 --> 01:28:40.712
You can't pick a jury that isn't.

1259
01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:43.923
Look closely at the distinguished
members of the jury, sir.


1260
01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:47.719
The first member is?

1261
01:28:47.802 --> 01:28:49.595
Jean
-Marie Barault, French.

1262
01:28:49.679 --> 01:28:53.433
Has any century passed without war
between England and France?


1263
01:28:53.516 --> 01:28:56.811
- The second member is -
- Gregorius Johannes Bund, sir.


1264
01:28:56.894 --> 01:28:58.187
Burgher from Transvaal.

1265
01:28:58.271 --> 01:29:00.606
The Boer War, Dr. Reeves.

1266
01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:04.193
- The third member is -
- Ivan Burdei, Russki.


1267
01:29:04.277 --> 01:29:06.320
- What?
- I am Russian.


1268
01:29:06.863 --> 01:29:09.407
The Crimean War, Dr. Reeves.

1269
01:29:09.490 --> 01:29:11.951
- And you, sir?
- Chang Chi Min, Peking.


1270
01:29:12.035 --> 01:29:15.830
Don't forget England's attack
on China in 1857,


1271
01:29:15.913 --> 01:29:18.041
occupying unprotected Peking.

1272
01:29:19.292 --> 01:29:22.253
- And you, sir?
- Rana Tejpalal from the Punjab.


1273
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.672
Think of India, Dr. Reeves.

1274
01:29:25.256 --> 01:29:27.216
Think of India.

1275
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.801
And you, sir, you are?

1276
01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:30.845
James Monahan, Irish.

1277
01:29:34.223 --> 01:29:37.018
Choose a new jury anywhere, Dr. Reeves.

1278
01:29:37.101 --> 01:29:40.438
It will always be prejudiced
against your country.


1279
01:29:42.023 --> 01:29:45.693
My lord, I wish to take counsel
for the prosecution's advice.


1280
01:29:45.777 --> 01:29:49.030
I challenge the jury and request
that a new one be chosen.


1281
01:29:49.113 --> 01:29:51.324
Chosen from where, Dr. Reeves?

1282
01:29:51.407 --> 01:29:53.951
- Mr. Farlan said from anywhere.
- Except from England!


1283
01:29:54.035 --> 01:29:55.536
Why not from England?

1284
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.372
Where else in the world have the rights
of the individual been held so high?


1285
01:29:58.456 --> 01:30:02.460
In America, sir, where these rights
are held to be inalienable.


1286
01:30:02.543 --> 01:30:05.963
I doubt if you have more practical freedom
in America than in England.


1287
01:30:06.047 --> 01:30:08.591
An Englishman thinks as he likes
in religion and politics.


1288
01:30:08.674 --> 01:30:10.510
It isn't what a man thinks and says.

1289
01:30:10.593 --> 01:30:13.763
It's when and where and to whom
he thinks and says it.


1290
01:30:13.846 --> 01:30:19.060
A man with a flint and steel striking sparks
over a wet blanket is one thing,


1291
01:30:19.143 --> 01:30:21.521
but striking them over a tinderbox
is another.


1292
01:30:22.438 --> 01:30:24.649
An American baby sucks in freedom

1293
01:30:24.732 --> 01:30:26.859
with the milk of the breast
at which he hangs.


1294
01:30:27.777 --> 01:30:31.531
A man can see further, sir,
from the top of Boston statehouse,


1295
01:30:31.614 --> 01:30:33.825
and see more worth seeing

1296
01:30:33.908 --> 01:30:36.869
than from all the pyramids
and turrets and steeples


1297
01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:38.704
of all the places of the world.

1298
01:30:39.622 --> 01:30:41.833
No smoke, sir.

1299
01:30:41.916 --> 01:30:43.668
No fog, sir.

1300
01:30:43.751 --> 01:30:46.838
And a clean sweep
from the outer light in the sea beyond


1301
01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:49.215
to the New Hampshire mountains.

1302
01:30:49.298 --> 01:30:52.301
Yes, sir, there are great truths,

1303
01:30:52.385 --> 01:30:55.304
higher than mountains
and broader than seas,


1304
01:30:55.388 --> 01:30:58.558
that people look for
from the tops of our hills.


1305
01:30:59.475 --> 01:31:04.021
America, sir, is the only place
where man is full-grown.


1306
01:31:18.286 --> 01:31:20.955
Then I choose a jury of Americans.

1307
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:29.297
Of Americans, sir, selected
from every walk of American life.


1308
01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.841
If there is one who has fought
in the wars of independence,


1309
01:31:31.924 --> 01:31:34.260
I want one who has fought
shoulder to shoulder with us


1310
01:31:34.343 --> 01:31:37.096
against our common enemies
in this century.


1311
01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.225
If the third has a mind
that can only think 170 years back,


1312
01:31:41.309 --> 01:31:45.146
I want the fourth
to be thinking 170 years ahead.


1313
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:48.983
I cannot deny that I hope,
know that I know,


1314
01:31:49.066 --> 01:31:52.236
that this jury will be prejudiced
in favor of my case,


1315
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:55.990
for I am pleading for the rights
of the individual against the system.


1316
01:31:56.073 --> 01:31:59.160
But it is also against the law,
Dr. Reeves,


1317
01:31:59.243 --> 01:32:01.829
the eternal law of the universe.

1318
01:32:01.913 --> 01:32:04.415
Nothing is stronger than the law.

1319
01:32:04.498 --> 01:32:06.334
The whole universe is built upon it.

1320
01:32:06.834 --> 01:32:10.129
This is a court
of justice, not of law.

1321
01:32:11.172 --> 01:32:14.967
My lord, I ask for a new jury
of American citizens.


1322
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:21.098
- Do you agree, Mr. Farlan?
- I would welcome such a jury, Your Honor.


1323
01:32:21.766 --> 01:32:23.768
The jury will stand.

1324
01:32:25.937 --> 01:32:29.148
The jury will retire,
and a new jury will take their place.


1325
01:32:36.948 --> 01:32:39.367
Robert Dupont, 
American citizen.

1326
01:32:45.122 --> 01:32:48.459
Lieutenant Pete Vandereyk,
American citizen.


1327
01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.176
Alexander Barabaranoff, 
American citizen.

1328
01:33:02.348 --> 01:33:04.558
George Wong, American citizen.

1329
01:33:11.399 --> 01:33:14.235
Jefferson Lincoln Brown, 
American citizen.

1330
01:33:18.281 --> 01:33:21.200
Patrick Aloysious Mahoney,
American citizen.


1331
01:33:25.663 --> 01:33:27.498
The jury will be seated.

1332
01:33:28.791 --> 01:33:30.042
Counsel for the defense?

1333
01:33:31.377 --> 01:33:36.132
Here in this rose is my case.
And what is my case?


1334
01:33:36.215 --> 01:33:38.175
I entirely agree with Mr. Farlan.

1335
01:33:38.259 --> 01:33:41.304
Has Peter Carter fallen in love
during the allotted extra -


1336
01:33:41.387 --> 01:33:42.805
Borrowed, Dr. Reeves.

1337
01:33:42.888 --> 01:33:46.350
Disputed extra 20 hours he had
or hasn't he?


1338
01:33:46.434 --> 01:33:50.980
Has someone, the name is unimportant,
fallen in love with him?


1339
01:33:51.063 --> 01:33:54.483
Now, here are two young people
who would never have met


1340
01:33:54.567 --> 01:33:56.193
but for a mistake higher up,

1341
01:33:56.277 --> 01:34:00.114
penalized for the most natural
and simple thing in the world.


1342
01:34:00.197 --> 01:34:01.657
They fell in love.

1343
01:34:02.533 --> 01:34:07.330
Here in this tear
are love and truth and friendship.


1344
01:34:07.872 --> 01:34:12.043
Those qualities and those qualities alone
can build a new world today


1345
01:34:12.126 --> 01:34:14.253
and must build a better one tomorrow.

1346
01:34:15.004 --> 01:34:16.797
That is my case,

1347
01:34:16.881 --> 01:34:21.135
and upon it I demand a verdict
that Peter Carter shall live.


1348
01:34:24.096 --> 01:34:27.391
Your Honor, we all feel
that the defendant and this young girl


1349
01:34:27.475 --> 01:34:29.143
should be given the chance to be heard.

1350
01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:32.938
My lord, nothing is impossible.

1351
01:34:37.485 --> 01:34:38.986
The court will adjourn.

1352
01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:57.314
There is no reason to deny ourselves,
for the dimension of time will not disturb us.


1353
01:35:57.398 --> 01:36:01.152
The jury feels it would help establish
a true picture of the conditions.


1354
01:36:02.403 --> 01:36:04.113
Very well.

1355
01:36:07.741 --> 01:36:08.951
I call -

1356
01:36:09.034 --> 01:36:10.453
My diagnosis was right.

1357
01:36:10.536 --> 01:36:14.248
Fine vascular meningeal adhesions
binding the optic nerve to the brain.


1358
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:15.916
The internal carotid and the chiasm.

1359
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.586
Similar adhesions
between the chiasm and the brain.


1360
01:36:19.336 --> 01:36:22.339
Did I tell you about my operation?

1361
01:36:23.174 --> 01:36:26.260
Dr. Reeves, we are not here
to check your diagnosis,


1362
01:36:26.343 --> 01:36:28.804
but to put certain questions
to this young man.


1363
01:36:28.888 --> 01:36:29.972
Quite right, certainly.

1364
01:36:30.055 --> 01:36:33.476
I call Squadron Leader Peter D. Carter.

1365
01:36:36.145 --> 01:36:38.439
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Frank. How's the operation going?


1366
01:36:38.522 --> 01:36:41.358
- Fine. Liza is a very good man.
- He better be.


1367
01:36:42.318 --> 01:36:44.236
Peter Carter,
you are on the witness stand.


1368
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.448
- You are under oath. Do you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Farlan.


1369
01:36:47.531 --> 01:36:49.325
You know me, sir?

1370
01:36:49.408 --> 01:36:51.535
There's no mistaking you.

1371
01:36:54.038 --> 01:36:56.540
Your smile is not unattractive, sir.

1372
01:36:56.624 --> 01:36:59.293
Did you use it to enamor
this young American lady?


1373
01:36:59.376 --> 01:37:00.794
I love her, sir.

1374
01:37:00.878 --> 01:37:02.546
Answer the question.

1375
01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:05.633
Would you repeat the question?
It, um, had "enamored" in it.


1376
01:37:05.716 --> 01:37:07.718
Never mind the exact question.

1377
01:37:07.801 --> 01:37:11.847
Did you consciously try to influence
the emotions of this young American lady?


1378
01:37:11.931 --> 01:37:14.183
We fell in love before we'd ever met.

1379
01:37:14.266 --> 01:37:16.560
- You claim you love her.
- I do love her.


1380
01:37:16.644 --> 01:37:19.480
- Can you prove it?
- Oh, give me time, sir.


1381
01:37:19.563 --> 01:37:21.649
Fifty years will do.

1382
01:37:21.732 --> 01:37:23.484
But can you prove it?

1383
01:37:23.567 --> 01:37:26.946
Well, can a starving man prove
he's hungry except by eating?


1384
01:37:27.029 --> 01:37:30.032
- Would you die for her?
- I would.


1385
01:37:30.991 --> 01:37:32.409
But, uh, I'd rather live.

1386
01:37:33.911 --> 01:37:35.913
Young devil.

1387
01:37:35.996 --> 01:37:38.624
Your Honor,
I apologize for the expression.


1388
01:37:39.291 --> 01:37:41.377
- Your witness.
- No questions.


1389
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:44.588
- Conductor 71.
- Monsieur?


1390
01:37:44.672 --> 01:37:46.966
Is the young lady available?

1391
01:37:47.049 --> 01:37:49.134
- She sleeps.
- She sleeps?


1392
01:37:49.218 --> 01:37:52.930
- The jury will please note that.
- I put her to sleep.


1393
01:37:53.013 --> 01:37:54.598
Indeed, why?

1394
01:37:54.682 --> 01:37:56.809
To enable you to call her, sir.

1395
01:37:56.892 --> 01:37:59.061
The jury will please note that.

1396
01:37:59.144 --> 01:38:01.647
I do call her, Your Honor.

1397
01:38:07.987 --> 01:38:10.781
You are before the high court
in the case of Peter Carter.


1398
01:38:12.074 --> 01:38:15.536
You have been called as a witness
by the prosecution.


1399
01:38:15.619 --> 01:38:16.954
You will tell the truth.

1400
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:20.749
This gentleman is counsel
for the prosecution.


1401
01:38:23.794 --> 01:38:27.172
- Child, where were you born?
- In Boston, sir.


1402
01:38:27.256 --> 01:38:29.300
Do you know this man?

1403
01:38:29.383 --> 01:38:31.468
- I think so.
- You think so?


1404
01:38:31.552 --> 01:38:36.181
- I only met him a few days ago.
- You hardly know him.


1405
01:38:36.265 --> 01:38:39.476
- How can you think you love him?
- But I do love him.


1406
01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.437
- Nonsense, my child.
- I object.


1407
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.024
- Counsel will withdraw the expression.
- It's all right, Frank. He's right.


1408
01:38:45.107 --> 01:38:47.651
There's no sense in love.

1409
01:38:47.735 --> 01:38:50.404
Wisdom still flowers in Boston.

1410
01:38:51.488 --> 01:38:53.866
Can you prove that you love him?

1411
01:38:54.575 --> 01:38:56.201
How can I?

1412
01:38:56.285 --> 01:38:58.954
- Would you be willing to die for him?
- Yes.


1413
01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.584
Would you take his place
in the balance sheet?


1414
01:39:03.667 --> 01:39:04.585
Yes.

1415
01:39:04.668 --> 01:39:05.836
- Don't believe her!
- Would you?


1416
01:39:05.919 --> 01:39:07.004
- My lord?
- Stand aside, sir!


1417
01:39:07.087 --> 01:39:09.214
- You've got no right to ask.
- How dare you address me like that!


1418
01:39:09.298 --> 01:39:12.259
- Peter, you must obey.
- Well, of all the dirty tricks!


1419
01:39:12.343 --> 01:39:14.261
This is contempt of court.
I'll have you committed.


1420
01:39:14.345 --> 01:39:15.888
Commit away.
Don't answer any more questions.


1421
01:39:15.971 --> 01:39:17.890
Do you realize that by this attitude

1422
01:39:17.973 --> 01:39:20.142
you've forfeited any chance
of winning your case?


1423
01:39:20.225 --> 01:39:22.269
All right, but you
won't get June as well.

1424
01:39:24.021 --> 01:39:26.857
Your Honor, members of the jury,

1425
01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.942
I'm afraid he really does love her.

1426
01:39:29.026 --> 01:39:30.736
Your witness.

1427
01:39:33.614 --> 01:39:35.991
June, you know me well. 
Do you trust me?

1428
01:39:36.075 --> 01:39:37.743
Yes, Frank, I trust you.

1429
01:39:37.826 --> 01:39:41.789
It is absolutely necessary that you take
Peter's place in the other world.


1430
01:39:42.373 --> 01:39:43.374
Have you gone mad?

1431
01:39:43.457 --> 01:39:47.086
If you really love him, June,
step onto this staircase and come with us.


1432
01:39:47.169 --> 01:39:50.255
- You are mad!
- It is the only way to prove your love.


1433
01:39:50.339 --> 01:39:51.924
- I do love him.
- You shan't go.


1434
01:39:52.007 --> 01:39:54.176
- My lord, I ask the court to restrain him.
- Granted.


1435
01:39:54.843 --> 01:39:56.345
June.

1436
01:40:03.519 --> 01:40:05.938
Take care, Dr. Reeves.

1437
01:40:06.021 --> 01:40:09.233
In the whole universe,
nothing is stronger than the law.


1438
01:40:16.448 --> 01:40:18.033
Good-bye, darling.

1439
01:40:42.808 --> 01:40:46.395
Yes, Mr. Farlan, nothing is stronger
than the law in the universe,


1440
01:40:46.478 --> 01:40:49.565
but on Earth,
nothing is stronger than love.


1441
01:40:58.115 --> 01:41:02.828
Members of the jury,
as Sir Walter Scott is always saying,


1442
01:41:02.911 --> 01:41:06.540
"In peace, love tunes the shepherd's reed.

1443
01:41:06.623 --> 01:41:08.876
In war, he mounts the warrior's steed.

1444
01:41:09.668 --> 01:41:12.337
In halls, in gay attire is seen.

1445
01:41:12.421 --> 01:41:14.715
In hamlets, dances on the green.

1446
01:41:15.632 --> 01:41:18.135
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,

1447
01:41:18.218 --> 01:41:20.721
and men below and saints above,

1448
01:41:20.804 --> 01:41:24.558
for love is heaven and heaven is love."

1449
01:41:24.641 --> 01:41:26.727
Will you please consider your verdict?

1450
01:41:30.147 --> 01:41:32.775
- Case for the defendant, Your Honor.
- Bravo!


1451
01:41:34.318 --> 01:41:36.153
The appeal is granted.

1452
01:41:36.236 --> 01:41:39.990
There now remains the new date
on Squadron Leader Carter's file.


1453
01:41:40.073 --> 01:41:42.284
Will, uh, both counsel approve it?

1454
01:41:45.746 --> 01:41:49.291
- Does that satisfy you, Dr. Reeves?
- Very generous, my lord.


1455
01:41:49.374 --> 01:41:51.877
Do you agree, Mr. Farlan?

1456
01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.588
Isn't that a little too much, Your Honor?

1457
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:56.423
I agree.

1458
01:41:57.424 --> 01:41:59.760
My lord, I hope this will not
establish a precedent.


1459
01:41:59.843 --> 01:42:01.094
- I object!
- I object!


1460
01:42:01.178 --> 01:42:02.930
- Uh, you, sir.
- You, sir.


1461
01:42:03.013 --> 01:42:05.098
You mean the rights
of the common man -

1462
01:42:05.182 --> 01:42:07.476
- The uncommon man.
- Exactly.


1463
01:42:07.559 --> 01:42:11.104
The rights of the uncommon man
must always be respected.


1464
01:42:11.188 --> 01:42:12.689
Exactly.

1465
01:42:20.781 --> 01:42:23.367
Keep his head firm, between the sandbags.
I've written him up.


1466
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:25.953
- Tell Nurse I'll send the notes.
- Yes, sir.


1467
01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:30.916
Congratulations.

1468
01:42:30.999 --> 01:42:32.876
An interesting case.

1469
01:42:40.008 --> 01:42:41.927
Peter!

1470
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:45.097
Don't forget your book!

1471
01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:19.715
Frank.

1472
01:43:22.217 --> 01:43:23.343
Frank.

1473
01:43:25.137 --> 01:43:26.555
Frank.

1474
01:43:42.946 --> 01:43:43.989
Hello.

1475
01:43:45.073 --> 01:43:46.241
Hello.

1476
01:43:47.784 --> 01:43:50.746
- We won.
- I know, darling.
