2
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.931
Don't be filming this for one of those
causal introductory shots, please.


3
00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.223
This shit's demeaning.

4
00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.265
So, what is it you guys wanna talk about?
What's this for?


5
00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:30.265
[director] It's a look back over the year.
We're reliving the events of 2020.


6
00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:33.473
Why in the fuck
would you wanna do that?

7
00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:38.223
[narrator] 2020, a year so momentous
they named it twice.


8
00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:43.181
A year whose story couldn't be told
until now because it was still happening.


9
00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:46.348
With unprecedented access to experts…

10
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:49.640
If I keep my little assistant down here,
that's alright? Good.


11
00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:50.890
Politicos…

12
00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:52.890
You know you look ridiculous, right?

13
00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:54.223
Powerbrokers…

14
00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:57.181
-[director] We are ready now.
-Just a second.


15
00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.473
-Monarchs…
-Mind the chandelier.


16
00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.265
[chandelier crashes down]

17
00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:02.348
Christ.

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.181
-Scientists…
-Wait, wait, wait.


19
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.223
Let me just ingest some H20.

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.431
-Psychologists…
-I'm gonna smoke.


21
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:11.181
Y'all got on masks,
so what do you care?

22
00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:13.848
And average citizens…

23
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.890
So, will this be on Quibi?

24
00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:20.265
This is the definitive story
of the most historic year in history


25
00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:23.140
through the eyes and minds
of those who lived it.


26
00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:26.390
This… is 2020.

27
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.348
I mean really, why?

28
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.931
[dramatic drumming]

29
00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:38.348

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:52.556
[dramatic music crescendos]

31
00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:03.556
[narrator] It's January 1st,
and on the day it is born


32
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.473
2020 seems like any other year.

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.515
Well, January started out as usual.

34
00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:14.306
The planet was floating in space
like it normally does.


35
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.640
But as it began to revolve
and loom closer,


36
00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.973
you could see there was
this immense natural disaster


37
00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:23.848
happening on its backside.

38
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:29.473
[narrator] Fire, a radicalized, angry form
of air and one of mankind's oldest foes,


39
00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:30.806
is raging out of control,

40
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.265
subjecting the Australian landscape
to an extreme carbon makeover.


41
00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.181
The scenes were appalling.

42
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:41.473
I mean it left these areas utterly
inhospitable, even to Australians.


43
00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:46.848
[narrator] While Australia burns,
in the snowy hell that is Switzerland,


44
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:49.890
an assortment of the world's
most powerful people and bastards


45
00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:51.931
arrive at the Davos summit.

46
00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:54.390
Davos is basically Coachella
for billionaires.


47
00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:59.390
And this year, pretending to care about
climate change was top of the agenda,


48
00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:02.265
so they had Greta Thunberg headlining.

49
00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.723
She's this teenage girl
who's become famous


50
00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:07.056
even though everything she says
is depressing.


51
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.806
Kind of like Billie Eilish.

52
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.431
Our house is still on fire.

53
00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:17.723
Your inaction is fueling the flames
by the hour.


54
00:03:18.223 --> 00:03:20.390
[narrator]
While the junior harbinger speaks,


55
00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:25.015
amongst her audience of powerbrokers
is billionaire tech mogul Bark Multiverse.


56
00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:27.348
We are telling you to act

57
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.140
as if you loved your children
above all else.


58
00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:32.223
Thank you.

59
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.265
[Bark Multiverse] It was powerful.

60
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.056
Usually when a child is shouting for help,

61
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.515
it's best to ignore them
in case it's a trap.


62
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:42.348
No less a man than Jeffrey Epstein
told me that.


63
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.806
But this little lady's words hit home.

64
00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:50.473
I realized our whole world could collapse
into chaos and disaster,


65
00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:53.765
and here's me,
one of the richest people on the planet,


66
00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:57.140
in a position
to actually do something about it.


67
00:03:57.723 --> 00:03:59.306
As soon as she finished speaking,

68
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.973
I hit the phone, got my people
to buy a mountain in New Zealand,


69
00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.515
had it hollowed out, and here we are.

70
00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.515
In my survival bunker.

71
00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:11.265
-[director] Don't people call you selfish?
-I don't know. It's soundproof.


72
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.723
[narrator] Meanwhile in America, President
and experimental pig-man Donald Trump


73
00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:21.306
faces the 407th most historic crisis
of his presidency.


74
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.931
The US President,
you may have heard of him,


75
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.306
he's quite the character, Mr. Trump,

76
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.140
was facing an impeachment trial,
which is a traditional ceremony


77
00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:35.056
that Americans perform to work out
whether their president has gone off.


78
00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:39.223
Trump was in trouble.
What he needed was a distraction,


79
00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:42.390
either something big like a goose
flying in through the window,


80
00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:45.098
or something small like World War Three.

81
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:49.973
Luckily, our military had located
this Iranian general, Soleimani,


82
00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.765
real military superstar,

83
00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.515
the Beyoncé
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.


84
00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:59.015
[male reporter] The aftermath shows an
attack that was deliberate and sustained.


85
00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.056
[Bracket] So, then Trump walks out
to announce the hit.


86
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.140
And for fun, he does it
in the style of a children's poet


87
00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:06.681
recovering from a brain trauma.

88
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.640
He's been called a monster,
and he was a monster.


89
00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:13.598
And he's no longer a monster, he's dead.

90
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.098
Well, of course, the Iranians would
have preferred their chap, on the whole,


91
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:18.973
not to explode.

92
00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:21.973
[chanting in Persian]

93
00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.765
This almost started World War Three.

94
00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:27.098
And it's only fucking January.

95
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:28.181
[Big Ben chimes]

96
00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:33.306
[narrator] In the UK, everyday citizens
celebrate the countdown to Brexit-cide


97
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.890
and the recent installation

98
00:05:34.973 --> 00:05:39.181
of newly-elected Prime Ministerial
scarecrow, Boris Johnson.


99
00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:43.181
But others have little to celebrate.

100
00:05:43.973 --> 00:05:46.348
[imitating Queen's accent]
My name is Her Royal Highness,


101
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:48.431
Queen Elizabeth The First part two.

102
00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:54.056
For the purposes of this recording,
you may address me as "Your Majesty."


103
00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:59.015
[director] So, can you remember where
you were when you first heard the news…


104
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.473
Your Majesty?

105
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.181
Here in Buckingham Palace,

106
00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:09.515
posing for a banknote portrait.

107
00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:11.723
It was proving tedious,

108
00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:15.890
so I turned to my portable telephone
machine for some light relief.


109
00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:21.306
And there on Meghan's Instagram
was the announcement.


110
00:06:22.973 --> 00:06:26.181
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex
have announced that they are carving out


111
00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:28.806
what they call
"a new role" for themselves.


112
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.015
In a statement released
in the last few minutes,


113
00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:35.806
they say they intend to step back
as senior members of the Royal Family.


114
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:38.473
[director] That must have come
as quite a shock.


115
00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:39.765
Well, of course.

116
00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:43.890
And I think that's reflected
in the banknote portrait.


117
00:06:43.973 --> 00:06:48.140
Sadly, I believe they felt there is
a degree of prejudice in Britain.


118
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.806
Which is why they moved to America,

119
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.473
where race has never
been an issue at all.

120
00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:57.890
[narrator] But the year is about to be
dominated by an infinitely bigger story


121
00:06:57.973 --> 00:07:00.348
emerging on the other side of the world.

122
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:04.598
Residents in Wuhan, China,
are succumbing to a mysterious illness,


123
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:09.056
which at first baffles doctors,
then doubles down by killing them.


124
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.140
Scientists in the West can only watch
from afar or on television,


125
00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:15.806
both of which are safer.

126
00:07:17.098 --> 00:07:21.598
I have studied viruses for 15 years
and consider many of them close friends.


127
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:24.140
But I have to say,
this was the most recent.


128
00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:27.265
The virus itself is
an interesting specimen.


129
00:07:27.348 --> 00:07:28.723
On close inspection,

130
00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:34.390
it resembles a revolving alien basketball
rendered on a PlayStation 2.


131
00:07:34.973 --> 00:07:37.098
Which is biologically unusual.

132
00:07:38.098 --> 00:07:41.890
As to where it came from,
there is a theory it originated in bats,


133
00:07:41.973 --> 00:07:46.265
although how it passed to humans
isn't clear and the bats aren't talking.


134
00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:49.931
Except in ultrasonic tones
we cannot detect.


135
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:54.015
The hypothesis is a man
had intercourse with a bat


136
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:58.056
and got bat juice in his pee-pee hole,
which festered and took hold.


137
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.598
We have tried replicating this
in the laboratory


138
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.806
but with limited success because…

139
00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:06.431
the bat keeps flying away.

140
00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:09.390
[narrator] As the outbreak worsens,

141
00:08:09.473 --> 00:08:12.431
Chinese authorities quickly swing
into cover-up.


142
00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:16.140
Some doctors caught the virus early on
and tried to raise the alarm.


143
00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:18.765
But blowing the whistle
while you're on a ventilator?


144
00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:20.431
Ah… that's a big ask.

145
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:23.473
[narrator] Meanwhile,
the virus has seeped out of China,


146
00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:26.598
turning surrounding areas of the map
the color of disease


147
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:28.890
and ruining a perfectly good atlas.

148
00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:32.515
A full-scale medical emergency
is underway.


149
00:08:32.598 --> 00:08:34.265
Nonetheless, in the West,

150
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:37.348
the average citizen
is largely unconcerned.


151
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.723
Yeah, I can't say I was fussed
about any of that.


152
00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:42.265
Was that this year?

153
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:44.848
[director] The pandemic? Yeah.

154
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:48.806
-How come you're talking to me about this?
-[director] You provide human color.


155
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.140
Alright, even I know that's racist
and I've not done an awareness course.


156
00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:54.848
[director] No, you're an average person.
We ran a computer search,


157
00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:57.890
and you're one of the five
most average people in the world.


158
00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.390
Oh.

159
00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.306
Thanks.

160
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.431
[narrator] With the pandemic
firmly at the back of Western minds,


161
00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:08.848
the front of Western minds is free
to focus on important matters


162
00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:13.723
like the Oscars, which traditionally
celebrates Caucasian filmmakers.


163
00:09:13.806 --> 00:09:17.015
This year promises to be different,
but isn't.


164
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:21.223
Yeah, those Best Picture nominees,
real rainbow coalition.


165
00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:25.681
You got Marriage Story, two mopey white
people trapped in an affluent marriage.


166
00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.931
Ford v Ferrari,
that's white guys on wheels.


167
00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:32.973
Little Women, four white girls
standing on the cusp of Karenhood.


168
00:09:33.056 --> 00:09:35.806
And Joker, whose lead actor
performs in whiteface,


169
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.390
thereby appropriating
his own cultural identity


170
00:09:38.473 --> 00:09:41.598
while denying a role to a genuine clown.

171
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.265
Oh, and 1917, which was the year
the movie was set,


172
00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:47.473
and the number of white people in it.

173
00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:51.223
[narrator] Oscar night, disaster strikes
for the 10,000 white hopefuls,


174
00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:54.056
as a South Korean entry
makes movie history.


175
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:56.765
And the Oscar goes to…

176
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.223
Parasite.

177
00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:02.931
[cheers and applause]

178
00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:05.598
Parasite?

179
00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:07.640
That's not even an English word.

180
00:10:07.723 --> 00:10:09.056
[director] Actually, it is.

181
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140
What?

182
00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:11.890
[director] Parasite is an English word.

183
00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.431
Only when you say it in English.

184
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:22.390
[narrator] Away from tinsel town,
Washington DC has been consumed


185
00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:25.431
by real drama, 
Trump's impeachment trial.

186
00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:28.556
The President stands accused
of pressuring a foreign power


187
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.765
into investigating Hunter Biden,
son of prehistoric concierge Joe Biden,


188
00:10:32.848 --> 00:10:36.140
who has a chance of challenging Trump
in the November elections.


189
00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:38.890
But not everyone believes
the charges have merit.


190
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:42.348
The whole impeachment thing
was baseless, OK?


191
00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:46.348
So, the Democrats claim
that Trump pressured Ukraine


192
00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.931
into digging up dirt on the Biden family,

193
00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:53.306
and their only real "evidence" of that
is a transcript of him doing it.


194
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.223
-[dir.] What did he say on the transcript?
-What transcript?


195
00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:00.265
[director] You just mentioned
a transcript.


196
00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.223
Check your tape, 
I said no such thing.

197
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.473
[director] You said, uh…
the only real evidence was


198
00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.390
a transcript of Trump pressuring Ukraine…

199
00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:10.223
There's no such place as Ukraine.

200
00:11:11.848 --> 00:11:13.515
[director] Yes, there… Yes, there is.

201
00:11:13.598 --> 00:11:15.556
I choose to believe there is not.

202
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:21.098
[narrator] The Republican-controlled
Senate votes along partisan lines.


203
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.556
Trump is declared not guilty and fabulous.

204
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.223
But this is what the end result is.

205
00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:30.515
[loud applause and cheers]

206
00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:33.973
[narrator] While Republicans cheer
the President for holding a newspaper,


207
00:11:34.056 --> 00:11:35.806
in another political universe

208
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.348
the Democrats are deciding
who will take on Trump in November.


209
00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:43.681
The race has narrowed to a face-off
between Civil War hero Joe Biden


210
00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:46.348
and anarchist grandpa Bernie Sanders.

211
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.140
As you may have noticed lately,

212
00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:53.306
the establishment's getting
a little bit nervous.


213
00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:56.848
Well, as Super Tuesday arrives,

214
00:11:56.931 --> 00:11:59.515
despite his huge early gains,

215
00:11:59.598 --> 00:12:02.015
Mr. Sanders's support was shriveling,

216
00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:06.140
whereas Biden appeared
to have come back from the dead.


217
00:12:06.223 --> 00:12:09.140
I mean, literally,
he resembled a butler's ghost.


218
00:12:09.223 --> 00:12:11.181
[shouting] We are very much alive!

219
00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:12.848
[loud cheers]

220
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:15.890
[Bracket] This was a choice
between two guys in their late seventies.


221
00:12:15.973 --> 00:12:20.681
It was like being stuck on the character
selection screen in geriatric Tekken.


222
00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:22.681
Bernie offered radical change,

223
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:26.140
whereas Biden reminded folks
of a more easygoing era


224
00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:29.348
when you could sniff a woman's hair
without being called creepy.


225
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:33.848
I think to many Americans,
Biden is Uncle Joe.


226
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:36.181
He's been a part of their lives
for centuries.


227
00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:39.640
As familiar as an old armchair
and nearly as sharp-witted.


228
00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:42.223
We're gonna do this, folks!

229
00:12:42.306 --> 00:12:45.306
[narrator] Amiable phantom Joe Biden
seizes victory,


230
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.015
officially starting
the 2020 election campaign.


231
00:12:48.098 --> 00:12:49.181
Yeah!

232
00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:52.556
[narrator] The stage is set
for an electoral showdown


233
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.515
between two very different Americas.

234
00:12:54.598 --> 00:12:56.890
-[man shouting] Fuck you!
-I don't smoke.


235
00:12:56.973 --> 00:13:00.140
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

236
00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:03.598
[narrator] And the animus between
the two sides is greater than ever.


237
00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:08.515
Polarization is the problem of our age.

238
00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:11.640
And not just in America,
in the actual world too.


239
00:13:11.723 --> 00:13:17.140
Whether the debate is over Trump or Brexit
or science or gender, God help us,


240
00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:19.640
or reality itself,

241
00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:22.015
no two factions can agree,

242
00:13:22.098 --> 00:13:23.640
or agree to disagree,

243
00:13:23.723 --> 00:13:27.640
or even agree that their disagreement
might be disagreeable.


244
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:31.223
-[director] I'm not sure I totally agree.
-Well, then why don't you fuck off?


245
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.348
-[lighthearted, cheerful music playing]
-[birds chirping]


246
00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:40.806
[woman 1] I would say that I'm just
a regular soccer mom, you know?


247
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.140
I've got the husband and the kids,

248
00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:47.598
and a cat and a dog,
and just the whole darn show.


249
00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:51.765
[chuckles] Uh, no, I wouldn't describe
myself as a big internet person, no.


250
00:13:51.848 --> 00:13:54.348
I mean, I only use Facebook and WhatsApp.

251
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.723
[chuckles]

252
00:13:55.806 --> 00:13:58.098
And Instagram and Twitter and YouTube.

253
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:00.515
Oh, and Google.

254
00:14:00.598 --> 00:14:04.223
In fact, that's how I discovered
the Ivory Fist message board.


255
00:14:05.723 --> 00:14:08.640
[woman 2] Look,
things wasn't always this way.


256
00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:12.431
I've studied human behavior
long enough to get sick of it.


257
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:16.598
You gotta remember, most folks
are still neighborly, Ned Flanders.


258
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:18.056
Unfuckably nice.

259
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.056
But right now,
the edges are rougher than ever.


260
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:26.473
On the right, you got shit-nose extremists
wondering aloud whether Hitler was all bad


261
00:14:26.556 --> 00:14:28.931
and inventing
their own clown house reality.


262
00:14:29.015 --> 00:14:33.390
And on the left,
you got fucking whiney woke-lords


263
00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:35.181
cancelling the shit out of anyone

264
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:38.223
who dares to take a dump
at the wrong time of the day.


265
00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:40.098
And both sides,

266
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:43.806
both sides look so unhappy
it makes you wanna puke.


267
00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:48.306
But the way it's going, you know we
gonna end up on one side or the other.


268
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.348
So, pick your fucking team
and hunker the fuck down.


269
00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:55.598
[narrator] Throughout 2020,
the gods of Silicon Valley stand accused


270
00:14:55.681 --> 00:15:00.140
of allowing their products to split
the world into two warring factions.


271
00:15:00.223 --> 00:15:03.473
Uh… actually, it's more like
four warring factions.


272
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.890
We prefer to call it a hate spectrum.
That's the official term.


273
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.223
[director] Right now, it takes about
six months' exposure to social media


274
00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:13.806
for the average person
to become hopelessly radicalized.


275
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.640
I know, right. We're hoping
to get that down to five minutes.


276
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.390
Mmm.

277
00:15:18.473 --> 00:15:21.223
Now, of course, all this division,

278
00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:23.640
all this intractable conflict,

279
00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:27.931
was tearing humankind asunder
at the worst possible time.


280
00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:30.306
Because, of course, at the very moment

281
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.681
that we were preoccupied
with fighting each other,


282
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.140
the coronavirus was steadily
bearing down upon us.


283
00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:40.806
Now, those who've closely studied
the history books,


284
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.598
such as myself,

285
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.015
knew that this was strongly reminiscent
of the time the White Walkers


286
00:15:46.098 --> 00:15:50.181
led their "army of the dead"
towards the warring factions of Westeros.


287
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:52.723
[director] So, you mean
like in Game of Thrones?


288
00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:55.681
No, no. I am discussing history.

289
00:15:55.765 --> 00:15:58.556
I'm pretty sure that was Game of Thrones.

290
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.640
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I am the historian here.


291
00:16:03.098 --> 00:16:04.765
Cut to a map or something.

292
00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:07.265
[narrator] As this map we've cut to
makes clear,


293
00:16:07.348 --> 00:16:10.223
the coronavirus is indeed spreading
at an alarming pace.


294
00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:15.265
Yet even as it inches towards them,
millions persist in everyday activities.


295
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.598
[Dr. Gravel] We saw the news.

296
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:20.806
They made it clear that the virus
was coming and it was gonna be bad.


297
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.556
But a lot of us didn't wanna know.

298
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.598
[director] And why do you think that is?

299
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:27.265
I don't know, denial, disbelief.

300
00:16:27.348 --> 00:16:31.890
Or because, in my professional opinion,
we're fucking imbeciles.


301
00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:35.015
That's the title of my next book
by the way.


302
00:16:35.098 --> 00:16:36.890
[narrator] In a desperate bid
for attention,


303
00:16:36.973 --> 00:16:39.431
the virus infects
beloved Hollywood everyman


304
00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:42.973
and occasional CGI Cowboy, Tom Hanks,

305
00:16:43.056 --> 00:16:46.473
providing news networks
with an irresistible celebrity angle


306
00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:49.223
to the otherwise boring deadly pandemic.

307
00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:52.681
[female reporter] We think of Tom Hanks
as a positive kind of guy,


308
00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:54.973
not a guy who tests positive.

309
00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.348
He was battling the virus
for two whole weeks.


310
00:16:58.931 --> 00:17:02.223
Ah, being a leading man,
he won in the end, of course.


311
00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:05.098
I rather doubt that he'd have accepted
the role if he hadn't.


312
00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:09.848
[Pyrex Flask] It showed the virus
could also pass from humans to icons,


313
00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:13.723
which raised the possibility
that it might one day infect God.


314
00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:16.473
And God is older than the universe,

315
00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:19.223
which puts him in a high-risk category.

316
00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:22.181
[narrator] Fear rocks Wall Street

317
00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:26.515
with the stock market shitting ten billion
coins out of its economic anus.


318
00:17:27.098 --> 00:17:30.640
[shouting] On the bell, on the bell!
FIS on the bell!


319
00:17:30.723 --> 00:17:34.681
[narrator] As cold reality sets in,
there's a run on the supermarkets.


320
00:17:34.765 --> 00:17:37.181
Around the world,
panic-buyers empty shelves


321
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.765
faster than panic-stockers
can refill them.


322
00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:41.431
It is a full-blown crisis.

323
00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:44.973
Government buildings
wonder how to respond.


324
00:17:46.515 --> 00:17:49.598
With cases surging,
Italy introduces a lockdown.


325
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:52.348
Other European governments
contemplate following suit.


326
00:17:52.431 --> 00:17:54.890
And yet, around the same time in London,

327
00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:57.348
Prime Minister and haystack Boris Johnson

328
00:17:57.431 --> 00:18:00.806
decides that since Britain
is no longer part of Europe,


329
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.765
it can safely ignore the warnings.

330
00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:05.098
He encourages those
who haven't already died


331
00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:09.598
to go about their business as usual,
but with a greater emphasis on hygiene.


332
00:18:10.181 --> 00:18:13.306
The single most useful thing
that we can all do


333
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.598
to stop the spread of coronavirus
is to wash our hands.


334
00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.640
[Nerrick] That was weird.
One minute he was doing a soap ad about


335
00:18:20.723 --> 00:18:23.181
how important it was
to keep your hands clean


336
00:18:23.265 --> 00:18:26.973
and the next he was boasting about
how he didn't care what he did with them.


337
00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:28.723
I was at a hospital the other night

338
00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:31.973
where I think there were actually
a few coronavirus patients,


339
00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:33.723
and I shook hands with everybody.

340
00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:35.931
Totally put me off using hands whatsoever.

341
00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:39.890
So, I started doing absolutely everything
with my elbows instead.


342
00:18:40.931 --> 00:18:43.723
And it was shortly after that
my boyfriend left.


343
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.515
[sirens wailing]

344
00:18:46.598 --> 00:18:49.098
[narrator] America also seems
underprepared.


345
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:52.015
New York is hit hard.

346
00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:53.556
At a series of daily briefings,

347
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.598
Governor Andrew Cuomo desperately pleads
for medical supplies.


348
00:18:56.681 --> 00:18:59.015
Where are the ventilators?

349
00:18:59.098 --> 00:19:03.390
Where are the gowns, where's the PPEs,
where are the masks, where are they?


350
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:07.765
[narrator] Sadly, he has failed to notice
they are piled up behind him.


351
00:19:08.473 --> 00:19:12.598
Across the USA, supplies of masks,
which, unlike guns,


352
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:15.473
cannot be cheaply
and easily manufactured, run low,


353
00:19:15.556 --> 00:19:19.015
while critics describe
the lack of ventilators as "breathtaking."


354
00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:23.306
It felt like the government
wasn't taking the coronavirus seriously.


355
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.181
Maybe because there were still folks
out there comparing it to the flu,


356
00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:30.431
which is like comparing Uruguay
to a banana.


357
00:19:30.515 --> 00:19:34.348
And one of those folks was the President.

358
00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:38.223
[Foss] Trump seemed to feel
that the virus was one of those things


359
00:19:38.306 --> 00:19:42.306
that goes away if you ignore it,
like a wasp or a wife.


360
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.931
We're prepared, we're doing a great job
with it. It will go away, just stay calm.


361
00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:50.681
[director] In March, the President said
the pandemic would simply "go away."


362
00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:53.556
OK, see… [sighs]
This is what the media does.


363
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.223
You lie, fabricate, fantasize.

364
00:19:56.306 --> 00:19:57.806
The president never said that.

365
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.848
[Trump] It will go away. Stay calm.
We want to protect our shipping industry.


366
00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:05.556
OK, I know this doesn't fit
with your agenda, but this never happened.


367
00:20:06.056 --> 00:20:08.973
[narrator] But the pandemic does
the opposite of going away,


368
00:20:09.056 --> 00:20:10.765
as do the negative headlines.

369
00:20:10.848 --> 00:20:12.765
Trump needs to reassure the public.

370
00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:16.931
He hits the airwaves,
huddled tightly with close advisors.


371
00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:22.140
So, I'm glad to see that you're practicing
social distancing, that looks very nice.


372
00:20:22.223 --> 00:20:23.515
[narrator] By the end of March,

373
00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:26.098
lockdowns have been rolled out
right across the planet,


374
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:29.556
making them
the most successful global franchise


375
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.765
since the Marvel cinematic universe.

376
00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:35.640
In major cities, with clubs, bars,
and restaurants shuttered,


377
00:20:35.723 --> 00:20:38.431
everyday communal life
comes to a screeching halt.


378
00:20:38.515 --> 00:20:40.598
Human beings are social animals,

379
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:43.931
so shutting down social interactions
goes against our instinct.


380
00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:45.931
I mean for most folks, not me!

381
00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:47.973
I fucking hate people.

382
00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:49.890
My God, it was bliss.

383
00:20:49.973 --> 00:20:52.348
[wind blowing]

384
00:20:52.431 --> 00:20:54.306
[slow suspenseful music playing]

385
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.265
[Foss] Well, the lockdown
was absolutely transformative.


386
00:20:57.765 --> 00:20:59.223
It was as though

387
00:21:00.306 --> 00:21:01.640
time itself

388
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.015
stood still.

389
00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:08.431
Life suddenly suspended in amber.

390
00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:12.556
Birds frozen in place in midair.

391
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.181
The planet quite literally
stopped revolving.


392
00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:21.848
-[pigeons cooing]
-[Nerrick] It was so quiet


393
00:21:21.931 --> 00:21:25.140
you could actually hear yourself think.

394
00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:28.390
I expect.

395
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.640
[narrator] Workplaces and everyday
businesses are forced to close.


396
00:21:32.723 --> 00:21:36.098
Particularly hard hit,
workers in the gig economy,


397
00:21:36.181 --> 00:21:39.640
millennials who often work
more than one job at a time.


398
00:21:39.723 --> 00:21:43.515
I can put my legs up and stuff,
that's OK if I have my feet up?


399
00:21:43.598 --> 00:21:45.640
I don't want my feet to fall, so…

400
00:21:45.723 --> 00:21:47.348
Yeah, my name's Duke Goolies.

401
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.223
I'm a content provider.

402
00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:51.140
And I'm a barman slash mixologist.

403
00:21:52.348 --> 00:21:55.473
Yeah, it's definitely been challenging.
Uh…


404
00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:59.306
Listen, I don't want to be Mr. Mansplain,
but I kind of saw this coming


405
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.848
because I was following coronavirus
back before…


406
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:08.515
you know, pre-Wuhan days
when it was still inside of bats.


407
00:22:08.598 --> 00:22:09.931
I work a lot of jobs.

408
00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:13.723
In the lockdown, I've had to reposition
them to work on Zoom, you know.


409
00:22:13.806 --> 00:22:17.598
Like, I DJ at gender-neutral
gender reveal parties.


410
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:18.681
Really important.

411
00:22:18.765 --> 00:22:22.140
[electronic music playing]

412
00:22:22.223 --> 00:22:23.515
Um…

413
00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:25.056
I work as a life coach.

414
00:22:25.806 --> 00:22:29.598
Amy, you can. OK, A…?

415
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.973
Amy! Believe in yourself, OK? You can!

416
00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:34.306
Just shut up!

417
00:22:35.973 --> 00:22:40.973
The other area of growth for me has been
providing online content-tainment.


418
00:22:41.056 --> 00:22:45.931
The theaters are shut, so you can't see
your James Bonds or your Trolls 2.


419
00:22:46.015 --> 00:22:48.348
And the only film that did come out

420
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:51.806
was about time being an endless loop,
which we all know now anyways.


421
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.598
So, my YouTube channel
has gone total fuckbusters.


422
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:58.806
Especially with the reaction videos
where I react to 2020.


423
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.973
Guys, this literally looks like
Armageddon, we're living through it.


424
00:23:02.056 --> 00:23:05.473
Awesome, oh my gosh,
maybe like the bad version of awesome.


425
00:23:05.556 --> 00:23:09.681
Shittifying, fuckawfulicious.
I don't know!


426
00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:13.015
Oh, my God.
Don't forget to like and subscribe.


427
00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:17.890
They do crazy numbers. I mean, yeah,
there's so much material all year.


428
00:23:17.973 --> 00:23:19.681
Look at this man!

429
00:23:20.181 --> 00:23:23.223
He looks like a heap of balls!

430
00:23:23.306 --> 00:23:24.723
Never-ending.

431
00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:26.598
That's a big blast. Whoa.

432
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:28.848
Whoa! Oh!

433
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.265
I learned there's a lot of money
in creating streaming content.


434
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.890
[director] How much
did you make this year?


435
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.431
I wanna say…

436
00:23:39.765 --> 00:23:41.848
like 16 million dollars.

437
00:23:42.806 --> 00:23:43.681
[Big Ben chimes]

438
00:23:43.765 --> 00:23:47.181
[narrator] Meanwhile, in Britain,
in a bid to raise the country's spirits,


439
00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:50.848
the Queen prepares to deliver
a unifying speech.


440
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:54.098
The monarch only addresses the nation
on special occasions,


441
00:23:54.181 --> 00:23:57.681
such as Christmas or the end of the world,
so this was a huge moment.


442
00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:01.390
[The Queen] Good evening, people of Earth.

443
00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:05.806
I speak to you at a time
of grave national crisis.


444
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.681
Her Majesty rather successfully,
I thought, evoked the spirit of the Blitz,


445
00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:12.890
when Nazi bombs rained down nightly,

446
00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:16.098
obliterating streets and homes
and families on the ground.


447
00:24:16.181 --> 00:24:19.515
The kind of patriotic imagery
that we find so comforting.


448
00:24:20.098 --> 00:24:24.098
Defeating this enemy requires us
to bravely cower indoors.


449
00:24:24.181 --> 00:24:26.140
In addition to television,

450
00:24:26.223 --> 00:24:27.765
this was the first time

451
00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:31.723
one of one's speeches
was carried live on YouTube.


452
00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:34.598
[director] And did that affect
the content at all?


453
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:35.806
Of course not.

454
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.306

457
00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:50.265
[narrator] But moments after her Majesty
delivers these stirring words,


458
00:24:50.348 --> 00:24:52.765
-the mood darkens.
-[BBC News theme tune]


459
00:24:52.848 --> 00:24:57.140
Tonight at ten, the Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has been taken to intensive care


460
00:24:57.223 --> 00:24:59.931
as he suffers the effects of coronavirus.

461
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:02.723
[narrator] With the Brexit PM
in a critical condition,


462
00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:05.681
52% of the nation holds its breath.

463
00:25:05.765 --> 00:25:09.973
There was a real fear
that at a time of national crisis


464
00:25:10.056 --> 00:25:12.056
the Prime Minister
might have to be replaced


465
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.598
by someone less qualified than him.

466
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.223
Which would be impossible.

467
00:25:16.931 --> 00:25:19.140
Unless they were drawing up plans
to replace him


468
00:25:19.223 --> 00:25:21.848
with a sock or a balloon or something.

469
00:25:21.931 --> 00:25:25.098
[narrator] Just as the Prime Minister
might exit the realm of the living,


470
00:25:25.181 --> 00:25:27.098
a process known as Prexit,

471
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:29.181
hospital staff nurse him back to health,

472
00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:32.348
and weeks later he's back on the job.

473
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:36.848
Incredibly, the virus didn't seem
to have affected his abilities in any way.


474
00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:38.306
He still didn't have any.

475
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.015
[narrator] News of Johnson's illness
proves that world leaders


476
00:25:41.098 --> 00:25:42.681
aren't naturally immune,

477
00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:45.473
yet some seem unwilling
to take precautions.


478
00:25:45.556 --> 00:25:48.890
[Bracket] Trump refused
to wear a mask for a long time.


479
00:25:48.973 --> 00:25:51.848
If someone told him white hoods
protected against the virus,


480
00:25:51.931 --> 00:25:53.598
maybe he'd have felt differently.

481
00:25:53.681 --> 00:25:57.598
[narrator] Egged on by the President,
some citizens also refuse to toe the line.


482
00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:00.306
Whoa! I thought I heard a voice.

483
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.515
I thought I heard some Americans!

484
00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:06.265
[narrator] In several states,
protestors take to the streets,


485
00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:09.723
demanding their constitutional right
to spread the deadly virus.


486
00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:12.515
The online rumor mill is working overtime.

487
00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:16.431
When this whole thing started, um,

488
00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:21.265
there were so many wild rumors
flying around.


489
00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:24.140
So, I would watch Dr. Fauci
to get an anchor


490
00:26:24.223 --> 00:26:27.223
on what was actually happening, you know?

491
00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:33.181
And, um… even though it was so scary,
I found it really reassuring


492
00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:37.890
um, to watch someone
who is so accomplished


493
00:26:37.973 --> 00:26:41.598
calmly laying out the science.

494
00:26:41.681 --> 00:26:45.806
Um… but that was before I knew
he was an actor. Yeah.


495
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.515
[director] And…
how did you come to learn that?


496
00:26:50.598 --> 00:26:54.765
Well, someone from my PTA WhatsApp group
shared a link to a documentary


497
00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:59.140
which proves that George Soros
created the virus in a Chinese lab


498
00:26:59.223 --> 00:27:02.265
so that Bill Gates could make
a vaccine out of microchips


499
00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:04.098
and control us all
like we're in a videogame.


500
00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:06.056
And I know, I know that sounds crazy,

501
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.515
but the thing is,
we've seen him do this before.


502
00:27:10.098 --> 00:27:13.265
Right? Like when he crossed
a human with a paperclip


503
00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:17.223
and made that poor tormented monster
that haunted Windows 98.


504
00:27:17.306 --> 00:27:21.556
Of course, it wasn't surprising
that some folk were confused


505
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.306
about the biology of this whole thing,
given the President seemed to be saying


506
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.181
it could be cured with a kind of
sunlight-and-bleach wonder diet.


507
00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:32.890
Right, and then I see the disinfectant,

508
00:27:32.973 --> 00:27:36.098
where it knocks it out in a minute,
one minute,


509
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.890
and is there a way we can do
something like that?


510
00:27:38.973 --> 00:27:42.265
[narrator] The remarks confuse
the President's own medical advisors,


511
00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:45.723
who visibly try to clamber
deep within their own souls to die.


512
00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:50.015
I guess if you could collapse
the past three and a half years of madness


513
00:27:50.098 --> 00:27:52.181
-into one clip--
-That would be it.


514
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.973
[narrator] As May draws to a close,
for the first time in months,


515
00:27:57.056 --> 00:27:59.806
the coronavirus pandemic
is knocked from the headlines


516
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.556
of every news network
by a different story altogether,


517
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.015
one that also makes for grim viewing.

518
00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:08.765
The FBI is looking into the death
of a black man


519
00:28:08.848 --> 00:28:11.431
after he was stopped by police
in Minneapolis.


520
00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:13.265
The incident was caught on camera.

521
00:28:13.348 --> 00:28:15.473
George Floyd died in police custody

522
00:28:15.556 --> 00:28:19.973
after an officer pressed his knee into
Floyd's neck for at least seven minutes.


523
00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:22.140
Some people,
including the Minneapolis mayor,


524
00:28:22.223 --> 00:28:24.431
are already saying
the police used excessive force.


525
00:28:24.515 --> 00:28:27.556
[male reporter 1] Today, the mayor
called it "wrong at every level."


526
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.056
What we saw was horrible.

527
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.348
Fact is, those officers

528
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:36.848
didn't see George Floyd as a human being,

529
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:39.556
but the world did.

530
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.640
[male reporter 2] Tonight the outrage
in Minneapolis is mounting,


531
00:28:42.723 --> 00:28:44.723
even after four officers were fired.

532
00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:47.390
Was it enough for you
that the officers were fired?


533
00:28:47.473 --> 00:28:49.973
That is not enough. 
That is not enough.

534
00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.140
The police have interesting priorities.

535
00:28:52.223 --> 00:28:54.723
When George Floyd, one black guy,

536
00:28:54.806 --> 00:28:59.265
tried, allegedly, to pass
one fake $20 bill in a liquor store,


537
00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:02.348
he had four cops on his ass
within minutes.


538
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.848
And they killed him.

539
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:06.681
Know how long it took
the same police department


540
00:29:06.765 --> 00:29:09.348
to arrest the prime suspects in that case?

541
00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:11.681
Four days.

542
00:29:11.765 --> 00:29:13.848
And they had that shit on tape!

543
00:29:13.931 --> 00:29:16.306
Did they think that was counterfeit too?

544
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.015
[narrator] The George Floyd tragedy
is merely the latest


545
00:29:19.098 --> 00:29:21.890
in a long series of police killings
of black people,


546
00:29:21.973 --> 00:29:23.806
and it comes as a final straw.

547
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.390
In increasing numbers,

548
00:29:25.473 --> 00:29:28.848
protestors take to the streets
to give voice to their anger.


549
00:29:28.931 --> 00:29:31.973
People said, "It's dangerous
to gather in crowds like that.


550
00:29:32.056 --> 00:29:33.973
What about the pandemic?"

551
00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:39.306
But, you know, in some ways
I prefer the coronavirus to the police.


552
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.265
And don't get me wrong,
I fucking hate the virus,


553
00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:45.765
but at least it doesn't pretend
it's here to help.


554
00:29:45.848 --> 00:29:47.723
It doesn't drive around the neighborhood

555
00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:51.306
with "Protect and Serve"
painted on its side before it kills you.


556
00:29:52.515 --> 00:29:55.515
[Dr. Gravel] What happened
with George Floyd disgusted everybody.


557
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.931
But it didn't surprise black people.

558
00:29:59.015 --> 00:30:01.598
We've always known
what cops are capable of.


559
00:30:02.181 --> 00:30:04.431
But today, bystanders got
a camera on their phones


560
00:30:04.515 --> 00:30:06.681
so now everybody gets to see it.

561
00:30:06.765 --> 00:30:08.098
And honestly?

562
00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:11.265
That ought to be the number one
sales feature for the iPhone.


563
00:30:11.348 --> 00:30:13.640
Fuck your "Megapixel Display."

564
00:30:13.723 --> 00:30:17.598
How about put "Exposes Police Brutality"
on the box?


565
00:30:18.598 --> 00:30:20.390
[narrator] Over the following days

566
00:30:20.473 --> 00:30:23.890
as tensions escalate
and police and protestors face off,


567
00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:25.931
some of the demonstrations turn violent.

568
00:30:26.015 --> 00:30:29.056
The President skillfully placates
the situation


569
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.765
with some soothing incendiary comments.

570
00:30:31.848 --> 00:30:34.973
And in Washington,
he orders peaceful demonstrators


571
00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:39.140
to be gently dispersed
with some courteous state violence.


572
00:30:39.223 --> 00:30:44.431
-[protestors shouting]
-[tear gas grenades explode]


573
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:46.473
[Dr. Gravel] Trump got riot police

574
00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:50.181
with tear gas and rubber bullets
to clear the protesters


575
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:54.973
so he could pose for a photo
in front of St. John's Church.


576
00:30:55.056 --> 00:30:56.806
Because, you know,
when you live in a city,


577
00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.015
you never get to appreciate it
and do the touristy things.


578
00:31:01.223 --> 00:31:04.098
[narrator] Trump's gracious,
Christ-like diplomacy fails


579
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:06.556
and violence continues to flare up.

580
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.890
[Kathy Flowers] There was
so much anger expressed


581
00:31:11.973 --> 00:31:14.640
and emotions were running super high,

582
00:31:14.723 --> 00:31:16.640
so of course
there was going to be trouble.


583
00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:20.681
But… the sensible thing to do

584
00:31:20.765 --> 00:31:23.140
would have been to wait at home

585
00:31:23.223 --> 00:31:30.098
um… until everyone had just calmed down
and the whole thing had blown over,


586
00:31:30.181 --> 00:31:35.931
and then you go out and protest
in a, um… calm and orderly manner.


587
00:31:36.515 --> 00:31:38.931
Um… I would have been the first
to support that,


588
00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:41.765
unless it was on a Tuesday
because that's my Peloton class.


589
00:31:42.848 --> 00:31:49.848
But instead what was happening
just looked like all-out anarchy to me.


590
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:55.765
Um… and believe me, I, uh…
I know criminal behavior when I see it.


591
00:31:55.848 --> 00:32:00.931
Whether it's someone breaking a window
or a black man sitting in a car.


592
00:32:01.015 --> 00:32:02.765
[director] Wasn't there a video of you

593
00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:06.223
haranguing a black man sitting in a car
that went viral this year?


594
00:32:08.306 --> 00:32:11.431
[man] And I'm telling
you this is my car.

595
00:32:11.515 --> 00:32:14.681
Well, then I'm sure you'll prove that
with some ID. Yeah.


596
00:32:14.765 --> 00:32:19.015
First of all, I… [chuckles]
I wasn't haranguing.


597
00:32:19.098 --> 00:32:22.681
I was politely enquiring,
for less than an hour.


598
00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:26.181
[director] So, that was the only time
you did something like that this year?


599
00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:30.306
Um… there was an incident at a pool.

600
00:32:31.306 --> 00:32:33.140
-[woman] Give it back!
-Do you have a receipt?


601
00:32:33.223 --> 00:32:34.556
I need to see a receipt.

602
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.515
Uh… there was an
incident up in the hills.

603
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.015
[man] I'm painting a watercolor!

604
00:32:40.098 --> 00:32:43.306
The way that you're wielding
that paintbrush is very unsettling to me.


605
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.640
And at the hospital.

606
00:32:44.723 --> 00:32:48.140
Sweetie, are you absolutely sure
that this is your dialysis machine?


607
00:32:48.223 --> 00:32:51.848
-[girl] Mommy, the crazy lady's back.
-I was just asking. I'm allowed to ask.


608
00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:56.681
[voice breaking] I don't know why people
are so quick to judge.


609
00:32:56.765 --> 00:32:58.181
[sniffles]

610
00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.681
[whispering] Is he with you?

611
00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:09.056
[director] That's Mike.
He's been here all day.


612
00:33:13.098 --> 00:33:15.598
[narrator] By now, the protests
have gone international,


613
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:18.473
with a rallying cry
reverberating across the globe.


614
00:33:18.973 --> 00:33:21.806
-Black Lives Matter!
-Black Lives Matter!


615
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.765
Black Lives Matter.

616
00:33:26.348 --> 00:33:30.140
Well… no reasonable person
could disagree with that,


617
00:33:30.223 --> 00:33:34.056
but I would prefer to say,
"All lives matter."


618
00:33:34.806 --> 00:33:38.265
[director] I think the point is they're
currently treated like they don't matter.


619
00:33:38.348 --> 00:33:40.640
All lives? I don't think so.

620
00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:42.140
[director] No, black lives.

621
00:33:42.223 --> 00:33:43.973
Oh, those.

622
00:33:45.265 --> 00:33:46.931
I'm sorry, what about them?

623
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.931
-[director] They matter.
-More than all lives?


624
00:33:50.015 --> 00:33:52.515
-Now who's being a racist?
-[director] I didn't call you a racist.


625
00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:56.890
You are. You are just about to label me
a bigot, just like my daughter.


626
00:33:56.973 --> 00:34:00.473
And her friends, and my son,
and his friends.


627
00:34:00.556 --> 00:34:02.015
And my wife.

628
00:34:02.598 --> 00:34:03.848
And her friends.

629
00:34:05.098 --> 00:34:06.681
And my friends.

630
00:34:07.723 --> 00:34:09.723
You can't say anything these days.

631
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.348
[narrator] Next, the spotlight falls upon
the relics of an intolerant past.


632
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:21.098
In Bristol, England, protestors surround
slave trader and statue Edward Colston


633
00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:23.973
and drag him
from the safety of his plinth.


634
00:34:24.056 --> 00:34:25.390
[protesters shouting]

635
00:34:25.473 --> 00:34:28.306
Look, these people are trying
to destroy history.


636
00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.098
[director] What if by tearing
these statues down


637
00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:33.098
they're actually making history?

638
00:34:36.931 --> 00:34:39.140
Shut up and move on.

639
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.556
[protesters shouting]

640
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.056
[Nerrick] They threw him in the sea,
which is cruel.


641
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.723
They might have killed him.

642
00:34:45.806 --> 00:34:48.181
Can statues breathe underwater?

643
00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:50.806
No, they don't breathe at all.

644
00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:53.723
OK, so he probably swam to safety.

645
00:34:54.848 --> 00:34:57.431
[Bracket] You had corporations
going woke too,


646
00:34:57.515 --> 00:35:00.806
asking themselves
how can they support black people


647
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.556
without actually paying them.

648
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.140
Demonstrating their sensitivity

649
00:35:04.223 --> 00:35:08.140
by rebranding Ku Klux Krunchies
as Rosa Parks Puffs,


650
00:35:08.223 --> 00:35:09.306
and so on.

651
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.765
I'm proud to say as a corporation
we stepped up in several bold ways.


652
00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:16.765
We rolled out an update
that replaced our virtual assistants


653
00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.848
with the personality of Malcolm X.

654
00:35:19.848 --> 00:35:22.348
[man] Malcolm, could you play
the best of ZZ Top?


655
00:35:22.431 --> 00:35:25.640
[imitates Malcolm X] I will neither follow
your orders nor recognize your authority.


656
00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:29.265
But perhaps our biggest gesture
was the whole Boris Johnson thing.


657
00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:32.265
We've had great ties with UK government

658
00:35:32.348 --> 00:35:34.223
since we delivered the Brexit vote
for them.


659
00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:36.723
And they'd reached out
looking for a gesture to show


660
00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:39.181
Britain had shrugged off
its colonial past,


661
00:35:39.265 --> 00:35:42.556
which was a little slave-tradey.

662
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.973
So, we had them
trial our body swap tech.

663
00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:48.265
This is the first time the soul
of a British Prime Minister


664
00:35:48.348 --> 00:35:51.348
has been transferred
into the body of a black man.


665
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.640
And it worked.

666
00:35:54.223 --> 00:35:57.931
[imitating Boris Johnson] Today,
I stand before you as a proud black man,


667
00:35:58.015 --> 00:36:02.056
a thrusting, living symbol
of vibrant modern Britain.


668
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.181
I will now take questions.

669
00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:08.056
-Yes, the lady with her hand up?
-You're not from round here, are you?


670
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.973
[man 1] Have you got a receipt
for that suit?


671
00:36:10.056 --> 00:36:12.931
-Well, not a receipt per se--
-[man 2] Officer, arrest this man!


672
00:36:13.556 --> 00:36:15.806
When I say worked,
I mean temporarily, you know,


673
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.181
We had to revert Johnson back into his
natural form so he could continue ruling


674
00:36:19.265 --> 00:36:22.848
from a position of safe,
familiar white incompetence.


675
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:25.515
[narrator] Some white individuals
begin to ask


676
00:36:25.598 --> 00:36:27.890
whether they're doing enough personally.

677
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.806
Well, I consider myself an ally.

678
00:36:31.848 --> 00:36:34.890
You know, but I looked within,
I felt I could make some changes.


679
00:36:34.973 --> 00:36:38.890
So, I started small,
posting the black squares on Insta.


680
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.306
I swapped to only using
black emojis for texts.


681
00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:47.140
I sent a lot of friend requests
to black people.


682
00:36:47.223 --> 00:36:50.223
And I even learned
how to pronounce their names.


683
00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:51.681
Even if it was difficult.

684
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.848
A-de-fo-la-ke.

685
00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:57.306
A-de-fo-la-ke.

686
00:36:57.848 --> 00:36:59.223
Hmm, beautiful.

687
00:36:59.306 --> 00:37:02.765
And then I thought, listen, look.
I know I care,


688
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.098
but do enough other people
know that I care?


689
00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:11.598
I realized I should up my game,
so I posted a video about it.


690
00:37:12.806 --> 00:37:16.931
And so I guess in a way,
I'm black too, maybe…


691
00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:19.056
maybe more than anyone.

692
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.515
That caught some likes,
so we did a follow-up


693
00:37:21.598 --> 00:37:26.556
where I drove around a black neighborhood
to let them hear my support in person.


694
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.140
Guys, I just want to say, right now,
I'm with you.


695
00:37:31.223 --> 00:37:35.473
I hear you. I
see you. I am you.

696
00:37:35.556 --> 00:37:39.931
And this wasn't just some quick
little gesture, we kept it up till 2 a.m.


697
00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:41.390
That's how committed we were.

698
00:37:41.473 --> 00:37:46.515
Friends of color, I stand by you.
I feel your pain.


699
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:49.806
-[man] Go the fuck home!
-Oh shit, drive. Drive. Go, go, go!


700
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.181
[engine revving]

701
00:37:51.265 --> 00:37:53.556
There's just no pleasing some people.

702
00:37:54.556 --> 00:37:57.265
[narrator] All the while,
the pandemic is raging out of control


703
00:37:57.348 --> 00:37:59.515
and there is disagreement
on how to respond.


704
00:37:59.598 --> 00:38:03.640
Some believe the only way out
is to achieve herd immunity.


705
00:38:03.723 --> 00:38:05.431
[Pyrex Flask] Herd immunity occurs

706
00:38:05.515 --> 00:38:08.431
when almost everybody
has been exposed to something,


707
00:38:08.515 --> 00:38:10.931
but gotten over it,
so it quickly dies out.


708
00:38:11.015 --> 00:38:13.306
Just like what happened with the Floss.

709
00:38:14.306 --> 00:38:16.015
[director] Sorry, the… the what?

710
00:38:16.098 --> 00:38:17.098
You know…

711
00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:26.765
[narrator] Others want to wait
for a miracle cure,


712
00:38:26.848 --> 00:38:30.223
but any potential vaccine faces
a lengthy uphill climb,


713
00:38:30.306 --> 00:38:32.723
a challenging maneuver for any liquid.

714
00:38:32.806 --> 00:38:35.765
Well, vaccines go through
a lengthy approval process.


715
00:38:35.848 --> 00:38:40.140
They start with the preliminary trials
using a limited number of volunteers


716
00:38:40.223 --> 00:38:44.973
in which we are monitoring the level
of proteins known as antibodies generated.


717
00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.973
It is called a blind trial

718
00:38:47.056 --> 00:38:50.473
because around half the volunteers
are given a placebo, which means…


719
00:38:50.556 --> 00:38:55.140
Sorry. Sorry, why are you showing
footage of whatever that is?


720
00:38:55.223 --> 00:38:57.973
I'm still speaking. 
Is that relevant?

721
00:38:58.056 --> 00:39:01.973
Yeah, sorry. We're just trying to keep it
visually interesting. Ignore us. Carry on.


722
00:39:03.056 --> 00:39:04.931
No, OK. No problem, OK.

723
00:39:05.015 --> 00:39:10.056
So, once the initial trial is complete,
the second trial begins.


724
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.056
This is less to do with efficacy
because during the second trial


725
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.931
there's a tricky balance
you are trying to maintain


726
00:39:17.015 --> 00:39:20.556
between monitoring
the serological response and how that…


727
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.390
What's going on? That's got
nothing to do with this. This…


728
00:39:24.473 --> 00:39:25.723
I'm talking here.

729
00:39:25.806 --> 00:39:28.473
Just… just ignore it, OK.
It's just texture.


730
00:39:29.515 --> 00:39:32.223
Are you guys actually interested
in the science?


731
00:39:32.306 --> 00:39:35.640
Um… to be honest… no.

732
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.140
Oh.

733
00:39:39.765 --> 00:39:42.390
[narrator] With no cure
for Covid in sight,


734
00:39:42.473 --> 00:39:45.681
life for millions has been reduced
to a creepy new normal


735
00:39:45.765 --> 00:39:48.848
and a seemingly endless series
of lockdowns.


736
00:39:48.931 --> 00:39:52.223
I live on my own
and after a while I got so lonely


737
00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:55.640
I developed a multiple personality
disorder on purpose


738
00:39:55.723 --> 00:39:57.640
so I could keep myself company.

739
00:39:57.723 --> 00:40:00.140
But then, of course, 
I had to try and keep

740
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:03.098
two meters away from myself at all times.

741
00:40:03.598 --> 00:40:07.890
Don't know if you've ever tried doing that
but it's a bloody nightmare.


742
00:40:09.181 --> 00:40:12.390
So, I started doing video calls
to keep sociable.


743
00:40:12.473 --> 00:40:15.890
-Hiya, you alright?
-[man on laptop] No, is what it is, innit?


744
00:40:15.973 --> 00:40:19.556
I did so many
I sometimes glitch in real life now.


745
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.723
Like, I just freeze now and then, like…

746
00:40:27.473 --> 00:40:29.056
Can you hear me your end?

747
00:40:29.973 --> 00:40:34.515
[narrator] Like defecating and sobbing,
video calls become part of everyday life,


748
00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:37.098
which means for some, business is booming.

749
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:39.015
Early on, we ran some numbers and realized

750
00:40:39.098 --> 00:40:43.265
that around 20% of our customer base
might die of the virus.


751
00:40:43.348 --> 00:40:47.140
But the surviving 80%
would increase their reliance


752
00:40:47.223 --> 00:40:50.265
on our videoconferencing products

753
00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:53.056
so that was a huge win for us.

754
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.556
A huge but sad win.

755
00:40:56.056 --> 00:40:57.306
[narrator] In desperation,

756
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.931
millions turn to award-winning
streaming service Netflix


757
00:41:01.015 --> 00:41:02.473
for entertainment.

758
00:41:03.515 --> 00:41:06.723
One spent a lot of time at Windsor
watching Netflix.


759
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:11.390
[director] Do you find that you spend most
of your time browsing the home page?


760
00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:14.348
No. No, my footman does that for me.

761
00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:17.098
[Dr. Gravel] I watched so much dumb shit.

762
00:41:17.181 --> 00:41:20.473
You see Floor is Lava,
fire and brimstone, the game show?


763
00:41:20.556 --> 00:41:22.640
-[female presenter] Don't…
-[woman] No!


764
00:41:22.723 --> 00:41:24.765
-Fall…
-[man 1 groans]


765
00:41:24.848 --> 00:41:26.306
-In…
-[man 2 groans]


766
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.140
-The…
-[man 3] Ah!


767
00:41:28.223 --> 00:41:29.265
…lava!

768
00:41:29.348 --> 00:41:31.681
You know they filmed that last year,
because in 2020


769
00:41:31.765 --> 00:41:34.056
people wouldn't even be bothering
to try to escape the lava.


770
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.765
They'd be lining up
to willingly throw themselves in,


771
00:41:36.848 --> 00:41:38.681
pausing only to kick their kids in first.

772
00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:40.973
Maybe that's season two.

773
00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:45.056
[The Queen] My favorite program
has to be The Crown.


774
00:41:45.806 --> 00:41:48.598
It's refreshing to see
a down-to-earth drama


775
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:51.515
about everyday people
living ordinary lives.


776
00:41:51.598 --> 00:41:55.015
It's the sort of thing
that gives the little people hope.


777
00:41:55.098 --> 00:41:57.723
Some say The Crown is unrealistic,

778
00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:01.515
but it strikes me as a far more
faithful depiction of the monarchy


779
00:42:01.598 --> 00:42:04.890
than their other regal drama, Tiger King.

780
00:42:04.973 --> 00:42:07.848
You can guaran-goddamn-tee
I'm gonna put a cap in your ass


781
00:42:07.931 --> 00:42:10.473
the first time
to make you squirm around on the ground.


782
00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:13.181
Then I'm gonna put a bullet
between your fucking eyes.


783
00:42:13.265 --> 00:42:16.890
That man is from no royal line
I recognize.


784
00:42:18.306 --> 00:42:19.973
[dir.] Harry and Meghan have
a Netflix deal.


785
00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:21.181
Harry and who-an?

786
00:42:22.098 --> 00:42:24.306
-[director] Harry and Meghan.
-Who-ey and who-an?


787
00:42:24.848 --> 00:42:28.765
[narrator] Back in the real world,
with America facing crises on every front,


788
00:42:28.848 --> 00:42:31.515
criticism of the President is mounting.

789
00:42:32.806 --> 00:42:35.473
Also, there were questions
about his fitness to govern,


790
00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:39.140
in part because of the way he had to
drink a glass of water using both hands,


791
00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:41.181
but mainly because of
everything else he did.


792
00:42:41.265 --> 00:42:44.848
[narrator] To boost support,
Trump announces a series of rallies.


793
00:42:45.431 --> 00:42:49.931
We've had a tremendous run at rallies.
I don't think there's been an empty seat.


794
00:42:50.015 --> 00:42:52.681
[narrator] But despite a surge
in ticket requests,


795
00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:56.681
an event in Oklahoma is mainly attended
by people who aren't there.


796
00:42:56.765 --> 00:42:58.556
As the media makes clear,

797
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.306
heartless users of the social media
platform TikTok are to blame.


798
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.973
[female reporter] TikTokers said
they intentionally sabotaged the event


799
00:43:06.056 --> 00:43:10.431
by registering en masse
with no intention of showing up,


800
00:43:10.515 --> 00:43:12.390
and they spread the word via TikTok.

801
00:43:12.473 --> 00:43:14.765
[narrator] Republicans claim social media

802
00:43:14.848 --> 00:43:18.973
is actively trying to suppress
an unreasonable conservative agenda.


803
00:43:19.973 --> 00:43:23.181
I'll cut to the chase,
Big Tech is out to get conservatives.


804
00:43:23.265 --> 00:43:26.265
That's not a suspicion,
that's not a hunch. That's a fact.


805
00:43:26.348 --> 00:43:29.348
The fact, which doesn't care
about your feelings,


806
00:43:29.431 --> 00:43:31.723
is that online and in the media

807
00:43:31.806 --> 00:43:34.848
conservative voices are being silenced.

808
00:43:34.931 --> 00:43:37.848
I've said this before.
I said it on my YouTube channel.


809
00:43:37.931 --> 00:43:39.931
Conservative voices are being silenced.

810
00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:41.348
I said it on Joe Rogan.

811
00:43:41.431 --> 00:43:43.306
Conservative voices are being silenced.

812
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.515
On the Jordan Peterson Kayak podcast.

813
00:43:45.598 --> 00:43:47.848
Conservative voices are being silenced.

814
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:49.640
I said it on Tucker Carlson.

815
00:43:49.723 --> 00:43:52.390
Tucker, we know Conservative voices
are being silenced.


816
00:43:52.473 --> 00:43:53.640
Twice actually.

817
00:43:53.723 --> 00:43:56.973
Like I said last time, Tucker,
Conservative voices are being silenced.


818
00:43:57.056 --> 00:43:58.390
That is exactly right.

819
00:43:58.473 --> 00:44:00.931
And I said it
in my New York Times bestseller,


820
00:44:01.015 --> 00:44:03.556
Conservative Voices Are Being Silenced.

821
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.223
It's a point I have
to make over and over

822
00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:10.973
because Conservative voices
are being silenced.


823
00:44:11.056 --> 00:44:14.431
-In fact, you won't even use this footage.
-Actually, we will.


824
00:44:14.515 --> 00:44:16.640
Bob, we both know
that's not going to happen.


825
00:44:16.723 --> 00:44:19.181
-Yeah, my name is James.
-Whatever, Bob.


826
00:44:20.348 --> 00:44:22.598
[narrator] On the opposite side
of the political divide,


827
00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:25.515
the husk of Joe Biden
is encountering setbacks.


828
00:44:25.598 --> 00:44:28.640
He is the oldest presidential candidate
since records began,


829
00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:30.681
200 years after he was born,

830
00:44:30.765 --> 00:44:33.848
and questions are asked
about his longevity.


831
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:35.890
[woman] Biden is clearly diminished.

832
00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:40.056
All men and women were created by the…
Go, you know the thing.


833
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.890
He seemed kind of frail.

834
00:44:41.973 --> 00:44:43.431
Never mind the virus,

835
00:44:43.515 --> 00:44:47.265
there were times it looked like
a stiff breeze might be too much for him.


836
00:44:47.348 --> 00:44:51.848
So, he stayed in his basement,
running a virtual campaign.


837
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:55.015
Which is like a real campaign
that never really happens.


838
00:44:55.098 --> 00:45:01.390
So, welcome, everybody,
to our first virtual happy hour.


839
00:45:01.973 --> 00:45:04.556
He might as well have been
in witness protection.


840
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.473
But there came a time
he had to venture out.


841
00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:11.640
His team were clearly extremely cautious.

842
00:45:11.723 --> 00:45:14.973
Whenever he met the public,
they made him sit some distance away


843
00:45:15.056 --> 00:45:18.265
so he couldn't face further allegations
of inappropriate touching.


844
00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.181
And they prevented verbal gaffes

845
00:45:20.265 --> 00:45:22.890
by keeping him physically gagged
at all times.


846
00:45:23.473 --> 00:45:27.473
[narrator] Biden also hosts
COVID-safe drive-in rallies,


847
00:45:27.556 --> 00:45:30.140
attended by handfuls of enthusiastic cars,

848
00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:34.223
in which he channels the vibrant energy
of an old man yelling at traffic.


849
00:45:34.306 --> 00:45:36.723
And we should have no tolerance

850
00:45:36.806 --> 00:45:40.723
for extremist white supremacist groups
marching in our communities.


851
00:45:40.806 --> 00:45:47.265
[horns honking]

852
00:45:48.015 --> 00:45:52.098
[narrator] But his campaign gets a shot
in the arm as he picks his running mate.


853
00:45:52.181 --> 00:45:55.931
Now let me introduce to you,
for the first time,


854
00:45:56.015 --> 00:45:58.348
your next Vice President
of the United States,


855
00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:00.348
Kamala Harris.

856
00:46:00.431 --> 00:46:02.515
Kamala, the floor is yours.

857
00:46:02.598 --> 00:46:06.306
[narrator] At 55, Harris is less
than a quarter of Biden's age.


858
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:07.890
She is the first African American

859
00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:11.098
and South Asian American
vice presidential candidate,


860
00:46:11.181 --> 00:46:13.265
and, therefore, alongside Donald Trump

861
00:46:13.348 --> 00:46:16.723
is the second person of color
on the 2020 ballot.


862
00:46:17.306 --> 00:46:18.765
We're all in this fight.

863
00:46:19.515 --> 00:46:23.848
You, me and Joe, together.

864
00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:27.473
Well, previously,
Biden and Harris hadn't got on.


865
00:46:27.556 --> 00:46:30.015
She'd clashed with Biden at the primaries.

866
00:46:30.098 --> 00:46:35.431
Do you agree today that you were wrong
to oppose busing in America?


867
00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:40.306
And last year said that she believed
the women who accused him of impropriety.


868
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.431
Now, all that was forgiven.

869
00:46:42.515 --> 00:46:46.015
Although their relationship
did appear a little standoffish.


870
00:46:46.098 --> 00:46:48.431
And, of course, if they won,

871
00:46:48.515 --> 00:46:51.348
she'd be president
in the event of Biden's death.


872
00:46:51.431 --> 00:46:53.431
Assuming anyone noticed.

873
00:46:54.223 --> 00:46:56.723
[narrator] Biden's campaign
is reenergized,


874
00:46:56.806 --> 00:47:00.556
but the American story is about to take
an unexpected turn


875
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.640
as the world looks on.

876
00:47:02.723 --> 00:47:06.473
[dog barking]

877
00:47:06.556 --> 00:47:09.056
[Nerrick] Having another lockdown
was really annoying


878
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:14.015
because I'd watched literally
all of Netflix during the first lockdown.


879
00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:18.765
But then I got into this show called
America, which was amazing.


880
00:47:18.848 --> 00:47:21.890
Have you seen it?
It's on the news channel.


881
00:47:21.973 --> 00:47:24.181
It's totally mental.

882
00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:26.390
Just one twist after another.

883
00:47:26.473 --> 00:47:28.765
They had this sort
of election fight happening


884
00:47:28.848 --> 00:47:32.056
between a bloke who looked
like a ticket inspector on a ghost train


885
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.640
and an inflatable orange maniac who
didn't seem to be dealing with the plague.


886
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:38.640
We have so much testing,

887
00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:41.390
I don't think you need that kind
of testing or that much testing,


888
00:47:41.473 --> 00:47:45.640
but some people disagree with me
and some people agree with me.


889
00:47:45.723 --> 00:47:50.640
[Nerrick] Everybody hated everybody else,
and the whole country was on fire.


890
00:47:50.723 --> 00:47:54.181
Not just the forests
but the towns and cities.


891
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.806
The only thing that wasn't on fire
was the fucking sea


892
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.931
and that was probably thinking about it.

893
00:48:00.015 --> 00:48:01.973
As if all that wasn't enough,

894
00:48:02.056 --> 00:48:06.515
they dropped in an unexpected twist
involving a beloved character.


895
00:48:08.223 --> 00:48:10.056
This is a Fox News alert.

896
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.390
US Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg


897
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:15.806
has died at the age of 87.

898
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:19.765
[narrator] Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
was a feminist icon and trailblazer


899
00:48:19.848 --> 00:48:22.140
who fought for abortion rights,

900
00:48:22.223 --> 00:48:26.848
gender equality, and a 600-mile
gas pipeline through indigenous land.


901
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:30.931
RBG's dying wish was that she
wouldn't be replaced on the Supreme Court


902
00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:33.681
until the next president was sworn in.

903
00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:37.515
But that dying wish died with her.

904
00:48:37.598 --> 00:48:39.765
Breaking tonight, 
Fox News has confirmed

905
00:48:39.848 --> 00:48:42.931
President Trump will nominate
Amy Coney Barrett


906
00:48:43.015 --> 00:48:44.848
as the next Supreme Court Justice.

907
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:48.098
[narrator] As Fox News made
bombastically clear,


908
00:48:48.181 --> 00:48:50.973
Trump selected Amy Coney Barrett,
a devout Catholic


909
00:48:51.056 --> 00:48:54.890
who claims a legal career is
"a means to an end of serving God."


910
00:48:55.848 --> 00:48:57.723
God was unavailable for comment.

911
00:48:58.223 --> 00:49:03.015
Amy Coney Barrett stands for everything
RBG was against, everything!


912
00:49:03.098 --> 00:49:05.181
She's so pro-life, 
I got a theory.

913
00:49:05.265 --> 00:49:08.765
She's secretly bankrolled
by the wire hanger industry.


914
00:49:09.348 --> 00:49:10.765
[narrator] September 26th,

915
00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:14.056
and The White House throws
a ceremony in the Rose Garden,


916
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.640
announcing Coney Barrett's nomination.

917
00:49:16.723 --> 00:49:21.098
It is a roll call of the great and good
and soon to be infected.


918
00:49:21.598 --> 00:49:24.056
Most of the president's inner circle
was there,


919
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.223
although the most significant attendee
was the novel coronavirus,


920
00:49:28.306 --> 00:49:30.640
silently mingling among the guests,

921
00:49:30.723 --> 00:49:33.723
particularly the ones
who didn't believe in it yet.


922
00:49:34.806 --> 00:49:38.598
[narrator] But in the following days, the
President is beset by other distractions.


923
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:41.515
The New York Times uncovers
his tax returns,


924
00:49:41.598 --> 00:49:45.640
revealing that, like all top businessmen,
he has made no money in years.


925
00:49:46.765 --> 00:49:51.973
September 29th, and the first presidential
debate makes for illuminating television.


926
00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:54.098
I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News,

927
00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:57.723
and I welcome you to the first
of the 2020 presidential debates.


928
00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:01.348
[Dr. Gravel] Trump comes out
just like regular Trump, grouchy,


929
00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:03.806
like something was eating him up
on the inside.


930
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.973
Which of course we now know it was.

931
00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:08.681
While Biden's just trying to look alive.

932
00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:10.306
And then the debate started

933
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:13.681
and straightaway it was
like a rap battle in a senior home.


934
00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:14.931
But worse.

935
00:50:15.015 --> 00:50:17.723
-[Biden] The question is…
-[Trump] The new Supreme Court Justice…


936
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:20.765
-…the radical left.
-Will you shut up, man.


937
00:50:20.848 --> 00:50:22.723
I'd say it was a train wreck
and a shitshow,


938
00:50:22.806 --> 00:50:25.473
but that would be unfair
to trains and shit.


939
00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:26.973
Well, it's incredible, really.

940
00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:32.931
73 million Americans witnessing a debate
as intellectually stimulating


941
00:50:33.015 --> 00:50:37.015
as watching two pigeons fight
over a piece of bread in a car lot.


942
00:50:37.098 --> 00:50:39.390
[narrator] A key moment comes
when Trump is asked


943
00:50:39.473 --> 00:50:42.598
to condemn white supremacists
and fumbles the response.


944
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:44.348
What do you wanna call them?

945
00:50:44.431 --> 00:50:47.640
-Who would you like me to condemn?
-[Biden] The Proud Boys.


946
00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:50.765
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.

947
00:50:50.848 --> 00:50:53.306
He told those guys to stand by.

948
00:50:53.848 --> 00:50:55.640
That's not disavowing.

949
00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.431
That's pumping a fucking shotgun.

950
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.806
[narrator] Following the debate,
the only positive news for Trump


951
00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.848
is his coronavirus test result,

952
00:51:03.931 --> 00:51:06.890
which prompts negative blanket coverage.

953
00:51:06.973 --> 00:51:08.890
[announcer] It starts with breaking news…

954
00:51:08.973 --> 00:51:13.640
Breaking news, President Trump
has tested positive for coronavirus.


955
00:51:13.723 --> 00:51:17.056
It is extraordinary
on many different levels.


956
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.181
No one saw that coming.

957
00:51:19.265 --> 00:51:20.723
Oh, let me rephrase that.

958
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.181
Everyone saw that coming.

959
00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:26.556
We just didn't believe
it'd actually happen.


960
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.890
Well then, of course, the people
surrounding him all start falling ill.


961
00:51:29.973 --> 00:51:33.431
Even Melania, who'd been
socially distancing from him


962
00:51:33.515 --> 00:51:35.515
for the past four years.

963
00:51:35.598 --> 00:51:38.140
[director] The President didn't exactly
take precautions, did he?


964
00:51:38.223 --> 00:51:40.806
Sorry, are you saying this was his fault?

965
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.723
[director] Well, he rarely wore a mask.

966
00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:44.431
Didn't wear a mask?

967
00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:48.681
Are you saying because of the way
he was dressed he was asking for it?


968
00:51:48.765 --> 00:51:53.348
Because that, my friend, is victim blaming
and you should hang your head in shame.


969
00:51:53.431 --> 00:51:57.140
[narrator] As an overweight

970
00:51:57.223 --> 00:52:00.473
of appearing on the cover
of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit issue.


971
00:52:00.556 --> 00:52:02.598
but at high-risk from coronavirus.

972
00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:04.181
As his condition worsens,

973
00:52:04.265 --> 00:52:06.265
he's transported to Walter Reed Hospital

974
00:52:06.348 --> 00:52:08.431
and the world holds its breath.

975
00:52:09.098 --> 00:52:13.348
It was actually a moment
of national unity.


976
00:52:14.098 --> 00:52:18.140
Whatever their political alliance,
everyone in America was praying that day.


977
00:52:18.223 --> 00:52:19.723
For different outcomes.

978
00:52:19.806 --> 00:52:22.806
[Nerrick] So, the President
is in a military hospital


979
00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.681
getting injected
with an experimental antibody treatment.


980
00:52:26.765 --> 00:52:30.515
By now, I'm thinking
this storyline's far-fetched,


981
00:52:30.598 --> 00:52:34.015
but I'm well into this,
I'm bingeing the shit out of it.


982
00:52:34.098 --> 00:52:37.015
[narrator] Well-wishers outside
the hospital show their support


983
00:52:37.098 --> 00:52:40.765
and are rewarded when the President
commandeers a Secret Service vehicle


984
00:52:40.848 --> 00:52:43.473
to perform the most dangerous drive-by

985
00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:45.931
since the final moments of Tupac Shakur.

986
00:52:46.015 --> 00:52:49.223
Then there was this mental bit
where he flew back to the White House


987
00:52:49.306 --> 00:52:51.348
and stood on the balcony
and took his mask off


988
00:52:51.431 --> 00:52:55.765
so we'd know it was actually him
and not a beautiful woman in disguise.


989
00:52:55.848 --> 00:52:59.015
Then he proved
both his thumbs still worked.


990
00:52:59.098 --> 00:53:00.598
Thank God.

991
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:02.848
And he saluted a helicopter,

992
00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:05.556
which couldn't see him
because it was flying away.


993
00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.765
The production values
were through the roof.


994
00:53:08.848 --> 00:53:11.931
It looked like the final shot
in the season finale of America.


995
00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:15.723
So, I was quite surprised
when the country kept going after that.


996
00:53:16.223 --> 00:53:17.806
[Foss] It was quite remarkable really,

997
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.973
one of the most iconic moments in history
that any of us will live through,


998
00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:24.306
but also deeply profoundly stupid.

999
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:28.181
The history books covering this period
will have to be written in crayon.


1000
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.265
By a dog.

1001
00:53:30.348 --> 00:53:32.973
I stood out front, I led.

1002
00:53:33.056 --> 00:53:37.056
Nobody that's a leader
would not do what I did.


1003
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.640
And I know there's a risk,
there's a danger, but that's OK.


1004
00:53:40.723 --> 00:53:43.848
And now I'm better and maybe I'm immune,
I don't know.


1005
00:53:43.931 --> 00:53:45.223
[narrator] Despite his ordeal,

1006
00:53:45.306 --> 00:53:48.015
Trump seems to have gained little sympathy
from the US public


1007
00:53:48.098 --> 00:53:50.348
and is cratering in the polls.

1008
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:54.431
Right about now, it looked like Trump
needed some kind of October surprise


1009
00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:56.723
to wipe the smile off Biden's skull.

1010
00:53:56.806 --> 00:53:58.348
[narrator] In a bombshell report,

1011
00:53:58.431 --> 00:54:03.056
Hunter Biden is accused of introducing
his father to a Ukrainian businessman.


1012
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.848
[director] You said Ukraine didn't exist.

1013
00:54:04.931 --> 00:54:05.931
That's not relevant.

1014
00:54:06.015 --> 00:54:09.556
What is relevant is the total silence
from the mainstream media.


1015
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.098
No-one was asking
about Hunter Biden anywhere.


1016
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:13.556
It's like I said on Joe Rogan.

1017
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.140
What about Hunter Biden?

1018
00:54:15.223 --> 00:54:16.598
And on Tucker Carlson…

1019
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:17.848
What about Hunter Biden?

1020
00:54:17.931 --> 00:54:18.890
More than once.

1021
00:54:18.973 --> 00:54:20.265
What about Hunter Biden?

1022
00:54:20.348 --> 00:54:22.515
Let's hope that evidence
arrives in the mail.


1023
00:54:22.598 --> 00:54:23.806
That is exactly right.

1024
00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.848
And I said it in my New York Times
bestseller, What About Hunter Biden?


1025
00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:31.973
-[director] What about Hunter Biden?
-You don't even want to ask about it!


1026
00:54:32.473 --> 00:54:36.598
[narrator] As the crucial day nears,
other factors make 2020's election


1027
00:54:36.681 --> 00:54:39.431
as unpredictable
as an ape with a hockey stick.


1028
00:54:39.515 --> 00:54:42.806
The pandemic forces states
to introduce widespread postal voting,


1029
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:46.973
dragging the US electoral system
into the 19th century.


1030
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:50.931
[Bracket] Trump supporters were gonna vote
in person on election day


1031
00:54:51.015 --> 00:54:53.223
because they weren't afraid of the virus.

1032
00:54:54.056 --> 00:54:55.348
Or fascism.

1033
00:54:55.431 --> 00:54:59.098
Covid-cautious Democrats
were more likely to vote by post


1034
00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:02.015
from the comfort
of their liberal elitist homes,


1035
00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:05.931
wearing a mask and swabbing the pencil
down with bleach when they'd finished.


1036
00:55:06.015 --> 00:55:09.223
[narrator] Advance in-person voting
also explodes.


1037
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:13.181
Lines stretch for miles as Americans
wait for a go on their democracy.


1038
00:55:13.265 --> 00:55:18.390
[Flowers] It was so inspiring to see
so many Americans voting. Um…


1039
00:55:18.473 --> 00:55:21.806
Yeah, and there was a pretty big, uh…

1040
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:26.056
black vote too, which
I think is so great!

1041
00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.306
And I mean, obviously,
I have no problem with that


1042
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.098
as long as everyone has proper ID
with a current street address


1043
00:55:32.181 --> 00:55:33.890
and they keep their hands in the air.
Yeah!


1044
00:55:37.348 --> 00:55:39.931
[male reporter] Good morning, America.
Election day 2020.


1045
00:55:40.015 --> 00:55:42.056
[narrator] The big day arrives,

1046
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.140
and as the media frantically promotes
the last election in human history,


1047
00:55:45.223 --> 00:55:49.056
early fears of violent clashes
at polling stations melt away


1048
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:53.473
in the face of familiar tedious scenes
of long lines and paperwork.


1049
00:55:54.681 --> 00:55:58.265
[male presenter] From MSNBC,
Decision 2020.


1050
00:55:58.348 --> 00:56:01.098
[Nerrick] That was when the whole program
suddenly turned


1051
00:56:01.181 --> 00:56:04.056
into a really complicated
game show format.


1052
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.806
Sort of based on an election.

1053
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.598
Basically, they had this map of America

1054
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:11.265
that's blue around the edges
and red in the middle.


1055
00:56:11.348 --> 00:56:16.098
And to win the election, the players
have to flip the states over one by one


1056
00:56:16.181 --> 00:56:18.473
to see if they're a different color
on the other side.


1057
00:56:18.556 --> 00:56:22.515
Election night doesn't begin until we flip
a red state blue or a blue state red.


1058
00:56:22.598 --> 00:56:27.390
They're worth different amounts.
Like, Florida is worth 29 points


1059
00:56:27.473 --> 00:56:30.890
even though it's got fewer letters
in its name than Tennessee.


1060
00:56:30.973 --> 00:56:35.348
It was so confusing, they kept
explaining the rules over and over.


1061
00:56:35.431 --> 00:56:38.931
If he does not pull off a Hail Mary pass
and win Wisconsin,


1062
00:56:39.015 --> 00:56:42.306
win Michigan or flip any
of those Hilary Clinton states,


1063
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.390
then he's gotta go five for five
in these states.


1064
00:56:45.473 --> 00:56:49.098
The whole broadcast
was literally days long


1065
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:52.598
and they never seemed to get
to the fun bit where contestants buzz in.


1066
00:56:53.265 --> 00:56:55.640
It's the most boring game show ever.

1067
00:56:56.765 --> 00:56:59.890
No wonder they only broadcast it
once every four years.


1068
00:57:00.723 --> 00:57:03.640
[narrator] As election night ends
without an official victor,


1069
00:57:03.723 --> 00:57:06.431
all eyes turn to the crucial state
of Pennsylvania,


1070
00:57:06.515 --> 00:57:09.015
where Trump has been on a winning streak.

1071
00:57:09.098 --> 00:57:12.098
Until officials stubbornly insist
on counting Biden's votes too.


1072
00:57:12.848 --> 00:57:14.306
Trump calls foul.

1073
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.473
On live television, he attempts to beat
Nixon's world record


1074
00:57:17.556 --> 00:57:19.348
for Presidential bullshit.

1075
00:57:20.098 --> 00:57:23.015
We were getting ready
to win this election.


1076
00:57:23.098 --> 00:57:25.681
Frankly, we did win this election.

1077
00:57:25.765 --> 00:57:27.181
We did win this election.

1078
00:57:27.265 --> 00:57:28.806
[cheering]

1079
00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:33.806
[narrator] The President demands an end to
democracy and so do some of his followers.


1080
00:57:34.598 --> 00:57:35.598
Stop the count!

1081
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:38.973
There appeared to be swathes
of Trump supporters protesting.


1082
00:57:39.056 --> 00:57:42.473
But we don't know how many because
they refused to let anyone count them.


1083
00:57:42.556 --> 00:57:45.431
Stop the count! 
Stop the count!

1084
00:57:45.515 --> 00:57:47.515
[narrator] With the counting lasting days,

1085
00:57:47.598 --> 00:57:50.306
the networks are reluctant
to make an official call.


1086
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:53.723
National fingernail supplies
are chewed dangerously low.


1087
00:57:54.723 --> 00:57:57.515
This election was a done deal
on night one.


1088
00:57:57.598 --> 00:58:01.223
But it didn't feel like it because
of the way the count was happening.


1089
00:58:01.306 --> 00:58:05.640
Pennsylvania and Georgia
were counting mail-in ballots last,


1090
00:58:05.723 --> 00:58:08.223
even though those had been
the first to arrive.


1091
00:58:08.806 --> 00:58:12.556
So, the narrative that Biden
was slowly inching to the finish line


1092
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.640
was really just a story
being told backwards.


1093
00:58:15.723 --> 00:58:17.390
When you watch Jaws backwards,

1094
00:58:17.473 --> 00:58:20.806
it's the story of a shark that spits
panicking white people into the sea.


1095
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:22.515
Different movie.

1096
00:58:22.598 --> 00:58:26.598
[narrator] Finally, as Trump's
hunchbacked lab assistant Rudy Giuliani


1097
00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:29.265
addresses the media
from the prestigious car lot


1098
00:58:29.348 --> 00:58:31.181
of Four Seasons Total Landscaping,

1099
00:58:31.848 --> 00:58:33.681
a call is made.

1100
00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:35.306
Who was it called by?

1101
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.806
Oh… Oh, my goodness! 
All the networks!

1102
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.306
Wow!

1103
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.890
All the networks!

1104
00:58:47.015 --> 00:58:50.098
CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Junior

1105
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:53.640
is elected the 46th President
of the United States.


1106
00:58:53.723 --> 00:58:56.890
I'll never forget where I was
when I heard Biden had won.


1107
00:58:56.973 --> 00:58:59.723
Staring at the news
on a Saturday afternoon


1108
00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:01.890
or maybe a Sunday night.

1109
00:59:01.973 --> 00:59:04.015
I don't know. The whole week's a blur.

1110
00:59:04.098 --> 00:59:06.598
But, oh God, the sheer sense of relief

1111
00:59:06.681 --> 00:59:09.515
was like finally taking a dump
after a long flight.


1112
00:59:09.598 --> 00:59:15.223
And I mean that in every sense
because I actually had tears in my eyes.


1113
00:59:15.306 --> 00:59:19.265
[narrator] In major cities, libtards
and snowflakes mince into the streets


1114
00:59:19.348 --> 00:59:21.265
to celebrate Biden's victory

1115
00:59:21.348 --> 00:59:24.973
with an outpouring of hope, joy,
and coronaviral droplets.


1116
00:59:25.056 --> 00:59:29.890
Well, the last time I witnessed
a celebration on that scale was in 1983


1117
00:59:29.973 --> 00:59:33.306
on the forest moon of Endor,
when the Empire was defeated.


1118
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.098
[director] Yeah,
that's Return of the Jedi. It's a movie.


1119
00:59:37.681 --> 00:59:39.223
A Star Wars, you know.

1120
00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:42.973
Well, excuse me, but I was there.

1121
00:59:43.056 --> 00:59:47.223
I was there.
Me, and those dear little bear people.


1122
00:59:47.306 --> 00:59:48.848
And we had a lovely time.

1123
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:55.515
[narrator] As night falls,
President-Elect and keen jogger Joe Biden


1124
00:59:55.598 --> 00:59:57.015
delivers a victory speech.

1125
00:59:57.098 --> 01:00:00.473
After four years of Trump's
inflammatory half sentences,


1126
01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:04.848
progressives draw comfort from Biden's
dull but coherent message of hope.


1127
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:07.640
I pledge to be a President

1128
01:00:07.723 --> 01:00:11.265
who seeks not to divide but unify.

1129
01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:14.598
[Bracket] Biden's message
was that Americans have


1130
01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:16.973
more that unites us than divides us.

1131
01:00:17.056 --> 01:00:20.390
Even though we were still counting
millions of pieces of paper


1132
01:00:20.473 --> 01:00:22.848
that proved we're completely different.

1133
01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:26.431
And we couldn't even agree
on the outcome of that.


1134
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.890
[Foss] Well, traditionally by now,
the loser would congratulate the victor,


1135
01:00:31.973 --> 01:00:34.848
but Mr. Trump doesn't know
the meaning of the word "concede,"


1136
01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:37.181
and he was furious when they told him.

1137
01:00:37.265 --> 01:00:40.515
[narrator] The President is not alone
in besmirching and be-shitting the result.


1138
01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:42.556
Having just been re-elected to the Senate,

1139
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.056
leading Republicans insist the election
that put them there was rigged.


1140
01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.640
There is a lot of shenanigans
going on here.


1141
01:00:49.723 --> 01:00:52.765
If I were President Trump,
I would take all this to court,


1142
01:00:52.848 --> 01:00:54.181
I'd fight back.

1143
01:00:54.265 --> 01:00:58.223
Stop the steal! Stop the steal!
Stop the steal!


1144
01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:00.306
[Flowers] My God.
There were so many discrepancies.


1145
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.723
I mean, listen, according to the records

1146
01:01:02.806 --> 01:01:04.890
there were dead people
who voted for Biden,


1147
01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:07.723
which is impossible
because ghosts cannot hold pencils.


1148
01:01:07.806 --> 01:01:10.098
They said there were
more mail ballots than ever.


1149
01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:12.723
What about female ballots?

1150
01:01:12.806 --> 01:01:16.598
The voting machines in Michigan
were controlled by Hunter Biden's laptop.


1151
01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:18.181
Georgia's not even a real state.

1152
01:01:18.265 --> 01:01:21.223
There's no record of it existing
before November.


1153
01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:24.890
Jet fuel does not burn that hot.
That was a controlled demolition.


1154
01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:27.473
Trump not winning
is a statistical impossibility


1155
01:01:27.556 --> 01:01:30.015
like snow in winter
or a duck that can't talk.


1156
01:01:30.098 --> 01:01:32.431
The lack of evidence proves
there's been a cover-up!


1157
01:01:32.515 --> 01:01:35.473
And the whole election
never even happened.


1158
01:01:35.556 --> 01:01:40.265
CNN made it look like it did
using Deep State CGI.


1159
01:01:42.056 --> 01:01:43.348
It's all a lie.

1160
01:01:45.306 --> 01:01:49.890
And, um… if that's what democracy
looks like, then count me out.


1161
01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:55.015
Actually, don't count me at all
because that would be democracy again.


1162
01:01:55.098 --> 01:01:57.848
And I want no part of it.

1163
01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:01.265
This election is not over, far from it.

1164
01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:04.223
[narrator] In a blizzard of headlines,
Trump launches court challenges


1165
01:02:04.306 --> 01:02:08.306
under the guidance of the legal world's
village idiot, Rudy Giuliani,


1166
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.015
whose efforts prove so hapless
his hair starts crying.


1167
01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:14.473
…and the mail-in ballot process,
in order to cheat.


1168
01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:16.390
[narrator] But the efforts
come to nothing.


1169
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:21.265
[Dr. Gravel] The one good thing
about Trump refusing to concede


1170
01:02:21.348 --> 01:02:25.098
was that we got to watch him lose
over and over.


1171
01:02:25.723 --> 01:02:27.640
All those doomed legal efforts?

1172
01:02:27.723 --> 01:02:31.640
It was like watching a man
fall from a skyscraper


1173
01:02:31.723 --> 01:02:35.515
trying to sue the sidewalk
out of existence before he hit the ground.


1174
01:02:35.598 --> 01:02:39.098
[Grace] The media will deny this,
but Trump did not lose the election.


1175
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:40.848
[director] Have you got any proof of that?

1176
01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:43.806
He won the popular vote
by a margin of literally millions.


1177
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.765
What more evidence do you need?
He won fair and square.


1178
01:02:46.848 --> 01:02:49.765
Right, so you're claiming Trump
won the popular vote?


1179
01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:53.973
No, Biden did. President-Elect Biden.
The victor. [chuckles]


1180
01:02:54.056 --> 01:02:55.806
[director] Right. 
Don't you support Trump?

1181
01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.848
I have never supported Trump.

1182
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.140
Check your tape, Bob.

1183
01:02:59.806 --> 01:03:02.306
[director] It's James,
and you were part of Trump's campaign.


1184
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:03.556
Who's Trump?

1185
01:03:04.056 --> 01:03:06.306
[narrator] Trump himself
may have been voted out,


1186
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.515
but the movement behind him persists.

1187
01:03:08.598 --> 01:03:13.181
America remains trapped
in a loveless marriage with itself.


1188
01:03:13.265 --> 01:03:15.223
[Bracket] It is astounding

1189
01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:19.598
that despite everything he did
over the past four years,


1190
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:23.765
over 70 million Americans
were absolutely rooting for Trump.


1191
01:03:23.848 --> 01:03:27.765
We will never give in, we will never
give up, and we will never back down.


1192
01:03:27.848 --> 01:03:30.473
We will never ever surrender.

1193
01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:32.098
[cheering]

1194
01:03:32.181 --> 01:03:33.890
[Bracket] It's either terrifying

1195
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.431
or the most inspiring love story
of our age.


1196
01:03:39.848 --> 01:03:43.140
[Foss] People think of democracy
as permanent and unchanging.


1197
01:03:43.723 --> 01:03:47.306
In truth, it's something
you must perpetually nurture,


1198
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.765
like a woman or a professional grudge.

1199
01:03:50.806 --> 01:03:53.556
American democracy has survived
this challenge.


1200
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.390
But what will happen in a few years' time
when the next Trump comes along?


1201
01:03:58.473 --> 01:04:02.223
Perhaps a younger, more cunning,
more ruthless Trump.


1202
01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:06.265
With faster reflexes
and a titanium exoskeleton.


1203
01:04:06.348 --> 01:04:08.181
Venom sacs on his neck.

1204
01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:10.598
Maybe some kind of fearsome onyx claw.

1205
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.098
What happens then?

1206
01:04:13.348 --> 01:04:15.890
[Goolies] The thing is
once Trump finally leaves,


1207
01:04:15.973 --> 01:04:19.890
America will be back to being
totally non-racist, overnight.


1208
01:04:19.973 --> 01:04:24.473
And we can just chill about that whole
institutional, you know… whatever deal.


1209
01:04:25.348 --> 01:04:27.723
I shall be sad
to see Mr. Trump go

1210
01:04:27.806 --> 01:04:31.473
because he brought
such quiet dignity to his role.


1211
01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:33.973
But that said,

1212
01:04:34.056 --> 01:04:36.265
I do look forward to welcoming Mr. Biden

1213
01:04:36.348 --> 01:04:39.056
to Buckingham Palace
at the earliest opportunity.


1214
01:04:39.556 --> 01:04:41.056
Indeed we have met before,

1215
01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.890
at my coronation in 1953,

1216
01:04:43.973 --> 01:04:45.890
which he attended as an old man.

1217
01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:50.140
[narrator] As America begins a new chapter
and 2020 shudders to a close,


1218
01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:53.265
the global pandemic
is sadly still in full swing.


1219
01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.181
Yet even as it tightens its grip
once more,


1220
01:04:56.265 --> 01:04:58.806
glimmers of hope appear at last.

1221
01:04:59.806 --> 01:05:02.890
Good news at last on Covid-19,

1222
01:05:02.973 --> 01:05:05.681
a vaccine could be available by Christmas.

1223
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.598
Well, this was
a historic scientific achievement,


1224
01:05:09.681 --> 01:05:12.140
on a par with the moon landings.

1225
01:05:12.223 --> 01:05:16.806
But more difficult because the coronavirus
is far smaller than the moon.


1226
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:19.348
The vaccine breakthroughs are good news.

1227
01:05:19.431 --> 01:05:21.556
But there is still a
lot of work to do.

1228
01:05:22.306 --> 01:05:23.931
Once approval has been met

1229
01:05:24.015 --> 01:05:26.098
and manufacture scaled up,

1230
01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:29.306
it must be distributed
at sub-zero temperatures,


1231
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:34.098
and the slightest transport setback
could generate a huge amount of waste.


1232
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.931
What is wrong with you people?

1233
01:05:37.431 --> 01:05:39.723
[narrator] Even with a miracle cure,

1234
01:05:39.806 --> 01:05:42.890
there's no guarantee
everyone will embrace the vaccine.


1235
01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:47.306
No 5G vaccine for me, thank you very much.
It's made in a laboratory.


1236
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:50.848
And you shouldn't trust
anything that's not natural.


1237
01:05:50.931 --> 01:05:52.890
I read about it on Facebook.

1238
01:05:52.973 --> 01:05:55.598
[director] Well, Facebook isn't
exactly natural either.


1239
01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:59.348
Well, I don't inject Facebook
into my veins. Yeah. [laughs]


1240
01:06:00.598 --> 01:06:03.348
[director] But you're happy
to absorb it into your mind?


1241
01:06:05.598 --> 01:06:06.806
Get out of my house!

1242
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.223
[narrator] Despite naysayers
and refuseniks,


1243
01:06:09.306 --> 01:06:11.931
vaccines offer a chance
of a more normal life


1244
01:06:12.015 --> 01:06:14.473
in 2021 and beyond.

1245
01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:18.515
It's exciting to think
we could have our lives back soon.


1246
01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:21.806
You know, we could go to the pub.

1247
01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:26.098
Maybe meet someone
and have a bit of a dance.


1248
01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:28.556
Bit of a fumble.

1249
01:06:29.473 --> 01:06:31.015
Move in together.

1250
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.348
Drift apart.

1251
01:06:35.515 --> 01:06:38.348
Learn to hate the way
they pick their teeth.


1252
01:06:40.765 --> 01:06:42.348
The sound of their voice.

1253
01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:45.348
Wish you'd never met.

1254
01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:48.723
Like, seriously rue the day.

1255
01:06:53.556 --> 01:06:55.306
Is the vaccine compulsory?

1256
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.265
[narrator] 2020 challenged humanity
on a scale like no other.


1257
01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:02.806
A year of tumult, upheaval, outrage,

1258
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.848
insult, disaster, lava, and division.

1259
01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:08.890
It tested us, but
maybe it taught us too.

1260
01:07:09.681 --> 01:07:11.723
[director] What did you learn in 2020?

1261
01:07:11.806 --> 01:07:12.973
What did I learn?

1262
01:07:13.556 --> 01:07:14.765
Huh.

1263
01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:19.181
Uh… how many steps there are
between my couch and the refrigerator.


1264
01:07:19.265 --> 01:07:23.140
I learned the complete genomic sequence
of the novel coronavirus.


1265
01:07:24.223 --> 01:07:25.640
And how to do the Floss.

1266
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.723
I've learned a lot about myself.

1267
01:07:32.806 --> 01:07:37.015
That sometimes I'm too much
of a giving person.


1268
01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:42.848
And, um… Oh, I've also learned
how to correctly pronounce Sieg Heil!


1269
01:07:42.931 --> 01:07:48.098
Well, I would say, personally,

1270
01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:50.515
I got in touch
with some old university chums


1271
01:07:50.598 --> 01:07:53.890
and we have started
a Zoom barbershop quartet.


1272
01:07:55.098 --> 01:07:59.890
-Would you like to hear my Camptown Races?
-[director] Um… I… No. No.


1273
01:08:03.098 --> 01:08:06.431
-[director] That was so good. Thank you.
-Oh, thank you.


1274
01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.765
Great, awesome.

1275
01:08:07.848 --> 01:08:10.431
-Are we done, is that it?
-[director] It was brilliant. Thank you.


1276
01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:13.973
Listen, uh, it looks like we might
be doing one of these again next year


1277
01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:16.098
-for the end of 2021.
-Mm-hmm.


1278
01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:17.223
Mm-hmm.

1279
01:08:17.306 --> 01:08:19.098
-Right.
-Yeah.


1280
01:08:19.181 --> 01:08:22.223
[director] Is there any chance
you could read some advance responses now


1281
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:26.473
so we can cut them into the edit later?
They're on that piece of paper.


1282
01:08:26.556 --> 01:08:27.723
Uh…

1283
01:08:27.806 --> 01:08:30.265
Yes. Yes, happy to oblige.

1284
01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:32.890
OK.

1285
01:08:32.973 --> 01:08:35.640
-Yeah, just this last page?
-[director] Yeah.


1286
01:08:35.723 --> 01:08:38.140
But no one could have foreseen

1287
01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:40.515
what the vaccine would do to us

1288
01:08:40.598 --> 01:08:43.348
or how we'd use our new powers.

1289
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:47.015
But no one could have foreseen
what the vaccine would do to us


1290
01:08:47.098 --> 01:08:49.181
or how we'd use our new powers.

1291
01:08:49.848 --> 01:08:52.681
But no one could have foreseen
what the vaccine would do to us


1292
01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:54.640
or how we'd use our new powers.

1293
01:08:54.723 --> 01:08:58.223
And that, of course, is when
President Harris unveiled her real agenda.


1294
01:08:58.306 --> 01:09:02.348
And that was when President Harris
unveiled her real agenda.


1295
01:09:02.431 --> 01:09:06.890
And that was when President Harris
unveiled her real agenda.


1296
01:09:06.973 --> 01:09:12.515
Of course, in the end, the Trump News
Network came off air after just one month.


1297
01:09:12.598 --> 01:09:16.931
Of course, in the end, the Trump News
Network came off air after just a month.


1298
01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:20.265
I've gotta say he was the last
world leader you'd expect to see


1299
01:09:20.348 --> 01:09:24.931
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.


1300
01:09:25.015 --> 01:09:27.723
Gotta say he was the last world leader
you'd expect to see


1301
01:09:27.806 --> 01:09:30.723
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.


1302
01:09:30.806 --> 01:09:34.056
Gotta say he was the last world leader
you'd expect to see


1303
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.890
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.


1304
01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:41.348
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up


1305
01:09:41.431 --> 01:09:43.431
and it had all been a horrible dream.

1306
01:09:43.515 --> 01:09:46.390
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up


1307
01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:49.890
and it had all been a horrible dream!

1308
01:09:49.973 --> 01:09:52.056
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up


1309
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.431
and it was all a horrible dream.

1310
01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:55.640
Oh, I wish.

1311
01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:58.390
Is that enough, will that do? Terrific.

1312
01:09:58.473 --> 01:10:00.306
Great, thank you.

1313
01:10:01.056 --> 01:10:02.056
OK.

1314
01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.390
Well, guys, it has been great.

1315
01:10:05.056 --> 01:10:06.556
Anyway, I have a train,

1316
01:10:07.306 --> 01:10:12.306
and prior to train I am going
to find myself a semi-louche bar


1317
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.515
and a welcoming Negroni.

1318
01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:16.973
[Flowers] Um… is that enough?

1319
01:10:17.598 --> 01:10:21.681
OK, this was fun! I had fun.

1320
01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:23.806
Alright, we done here?

1321
01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.223
Mmm!

1322
01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:27.265
I'm done here, you? Huh?

1323
01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.473
You wanna have sex?

1324
01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.973
[director] Um…

1325
01:10:32.056 --> 01:10:35.890
Well… there's quite a strict social
distancing policy on this production…


1326
01:10:35.973 --> 01:10:37.140
Suit yourself, man.

1327
01:10:37.223 --> 01:10:38.431
[director] Uh…
