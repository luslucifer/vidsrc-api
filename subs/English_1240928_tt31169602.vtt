1
00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.212
Holt: A New York grand jury
has just voted to indict


2
00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:16.089
former president Donald Trump.

3
00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:19.467
It's the first indictment
ever of a former U.S. president


4
00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:20.969
and could have a major impact

5
00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.596
in the 2024 race
for the White House.


6
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.139
Man:
Trump's attorney has been told


7
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:26.808
the indictment relates
to hush-money payments


8
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.560
made during the 2016
presidential election


9
00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:31.604
to porn actress
Stormy Daniels.


10
00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.524
DeSantis says Florida
will not assist


11
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.734
in an extradition request.

12
00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.444
Ugh. Let's pack.

13
00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:40.196
Man #2: The judge did say
to Mr. Trump,


14
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.614
and I'm quoting now,

15
00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.075
"Please refrain
from making comments


16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.704
that have the potential
to incite violence."


17
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:56.170
**

18
00:00:56.296 --> 00:01:01.426
Daniels:
I have been just tormented
for the last five years or so,


19
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.261
and here I am.
I'm still here.


20
00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.054
Blade:
What are we doing?


21
00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.849
Are you fucking filming me?

22
00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:12.103
I've been traveling the world
to speak at universities.


23
00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.440
It's not something
that you think would ever happen


24
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:18.526
in your lifetime,
coming from porn.


25
00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:23.072
Man: We're very, very lucky
to have Stormy Daniels.


26
00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.993
Daniels: People want to believe
what they want to believe,


27
00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:28.286
no matter what.

28
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.496
I really wanted
to use my platform


29
00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:32.707
to prove that
I could not be bullied,


30
00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.668
that women could not be
quieted or hushed.


31
00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:37.211
Woman: Stormy,
with the recent indictment,


32
00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.213
is it dangerous to keep
speaking out in public?


33
00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:42.050
You know, there's that saying,
"hiding in plain view."


34
00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:45.929
If I hide and cower away,
it just sort of feeds the bully.


35
00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:48.014
So it's just going
to make it worse.


36
00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.432
Blade: Where are we?
Daniels: Where are we?


37
00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:50.433
Blade: Where are we?

38
00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:51.851
I don't even know anymore.

39
00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:54.729
Man: Donald Trump is facing
criminal charges.


40
00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:57.732
He's already suggested
there would be destruction


41
00:01:57.857 --> 00:01:59.609
and violence
if this happened.


42
00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:00.985
So people will be
holding their breath


43
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.321
now these charges
have been brought.


44
00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.907
Daniels:
At first, when I spoke out,
you'd never saw my name


45
00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:08.493
that didn't say "porn star"
in front of it.


46
00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.788
Because we're not
considered human.


47
00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:13.831
Because of that,
people thought I couldn't


48
00:02:13.957 --> 00:02:15.124
possibly be telling the truth.

49
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.876
Man: Back the fuck up!

50
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.836
Daniels:
That was the real reason why,


51
00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:22.131
at the end of the day,
I decided to come forward.


52
00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:27.679
**

53
00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:29.889
Okay. I'm ready.

54
00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:35.728
**

55
00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:37.730
Gibson: So let me know
when we're good to go.


56
00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:39.524
Man: I'm ready.

57
00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.694
Gibson:
Okay, let's do this.


58
00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.279
Stormy, introduce yourself

59
00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:46.864
and tell us why
you're doing this documentary.


60
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.660
**

61
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:53.871
Daniels: I am Stormy Daniels,
from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.


62
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:57.125
Adult-film star, writer, mom,

63
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.877
pain in the ass, idiot
who can't keep her mouth shut.


64
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.213
I don't know.

65
00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:06.676
Flowers,
or just the usual?


66
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:08.886
That one. Just the usual.

67
00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:10.555
This one will look
really good on you, yeah.


68
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.973
As long as it's not red.

69
00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:13.725
Yeah.

70
00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.811
You're so much better
at this than me.


71
00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:20.106
Daniels: I am here today
to tell my story.


72
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.818
And even if I just change a few
people's minds, that's fine.


73
00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:26.362
If not, at least my daughter
can look back on this


74
00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.073
and know the truth.

75
00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:31.034
Man:
Take one, marker.


76
00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.786
Daniels: And...

77
00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:34.787
action.

78
00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:38.207
In 2018,
before the story broke,


79
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.626
I was transitioning out

80
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.878
from being in front
of the camera to behind.


81
00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.547
We can see Jake
get up from his desk.


82
00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:45.757
So I want to be here.

83
00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:48.009
I was finally
getting recognition.


84
00:03:48.134 --> 00:03:50.261
I had just become
the second-highest-paid director


85
00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:51.596
in porn.

86
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:54.057
Make sure that you go that way.

87
00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:56.267
I was writing and directing
between 10 and 12 movies a year.


88
00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.811
We're gonna do six
and eight first, actually.


89
00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.480
And I started working
on a horror film,


90
00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:03.191
which was my dream.

91
00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:06.653
And I had numerous
dance bookings at strip clubs


92
00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:08.154
across the country.

93
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.032
I was only gone
for like five days a month.


94
00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:15.578
Otherwise, I was home
with my husband and my daughter.


95
00:04:15.703 --> 00:04:20.750
I lived in what I considered
to be my dream home in Texas.


96
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:24.170
My neighbors had no idea
that I was a porn star.


97
00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.673
What was really,
really important to me


98
00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:28.967
was to be a good mom.

99
00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:34.097
**

100
00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:37.850
I grew up in this pretty rough
neighborhood in Baton Rouge.


101
00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.103
Lots of drugs,
a lot of violence.


102
00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.563
We used to hear gunshots
and stuff all the time.


103
00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.858
I was basically white trash.

104
00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:47.360
I have a few pictures of me,
of my dad.


105
00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:49.988
Like, there's an old picture
of me and my dad.


106
00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.323
This is when he was
rocking the the porn stache.


107
00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:56.869
This is my dad teaching me
how to drive a boat.


108
00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:58.913
He never wanted
to have a child.


109
00:04:59.038 --> 00:05:02.125
He was very transparent
about that with my mother.


110
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.085
She got pregnant on purpose
because she wanted to be a mom,


111
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.171
and she wanted to have his baby,
which I understand.


112
00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:09.299
But, also, you shouldn't
take that right away


113
00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:12.260
from the other parent.

114
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:16.514
This is one of the only pictures
I have of me and my mom.


115
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.225
My parents split up
when I was 4.


116
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.813
After my dad left,
my mother sort of changed.


117
00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:28.484
I think it broke her heart.
She was married a couple times.


118
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.236
None of them were great.

119
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:34.741
And she just became
a very neglectful parent.


120
00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.576
She never, like, beat me
or anything like that,


121
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.704
but she would disappear
for a long time,


122
00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.749
and then the power got cut off.

123
00:05:42.874 --> 00:05:46.169
Being not a repetition
of my mom,


124
00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:49.756
that's something really,
really important to me.


125
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:53.092
The last time I talked
to my dad, I was 17.


126
00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:57.764
I hadn't seen him
or spoken to him since then.


127
00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.974
But he married
my stepmom, Susan,


128
00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.938
who gifted me
with my love of horses.


129
00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:07.357
**

130
00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:09.651
My first horse show.

131
00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:12.570
I started riding horses
when I was 11.


132
00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:14.906
It gave me, like, an outlet.

133
00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:16.324
Was able to teach lessons

134
00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.785
and work exercising
other people's horses.


135
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.662
So it was also a way
to make money.


136
00:06:20.787 --> 00:06:24.874
And I just feel like it
gave me a sense of control.


137
00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.795
I wanted to be
a veterinarian first.


138
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.381
I got a full scholarship
to Texas A&M


139
00:06:31.506 --> 00:06:33.424
for veterinary medicine.

140
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:36.386
But blessing in disguise
that I did not become a vet


141
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.889
because I would have gone after
somebody who hurt an animal,


142
00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:41.975
or I would be on "Hoarders,"

143
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.228
because I would have
all of the horses.


144
00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:47.105
And that's kind of also the
reason why I started dancing,


145
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.983
because I had a horse to feed.

146
00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:54.404
When I was 17,
I went to some party,


147
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:55.905
and this girl pulls up

148
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.407
and she's got this
brand-new purple Camaro,


149
00:06:57.532 --> 00:07:03.663
which in '97, in Louisiana,
is a purple Ferrari.


150
00:07:03.788 --> 00:07:05.915
**

151
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.208
But I was like, "Oh, my God.

152
00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.918
Did you get that
for graduation?"


153
00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:10.628
She's like,
"I bought it for myself."


154
00:07:10.753 --> 00:07:12.422
And I was like,
"What do you do?"


155
00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:14.048
She's like, "I'm a dancer.

156
00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:16.134
You should come by
and see me at work one day."


157
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:17.719
Fast-forward
a couple weeks later,


158
00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:19.387
I got to the club.

159
00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:21.347
They were like,
"You want to do a guest set?"


160
00:07:21.472 --> 00:07:23.516
And the next thing I know, it
was basically that door opening,


161
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.810
it was like, pbt!,
and I was out on stage,


162
00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:28.563
and I made more
in that 30 seconds


163
00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:31.149
than I did in two weeks
of shoveling horse shit.


164
00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:33.860
And I was like,
"This is my dream.


165
00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:36.487
Do you know how many horses
I could have?"


166
00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:37.864
One of my first modeling shoots.

167
00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:40.700
This is before I ever did porn
or moved to L.A.


168
00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:42.994
**

169
00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:47.081
I never wanted to be
a mainstream actress.


170
00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:48.958
That's the running joke
is that people who do porn


171
00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:52.253
failed as actresses.

172
00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:54.964
When I started dancing
more and more,


173
00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.300
I bought my house,
I bought my boobs.


174
00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:01.387
And then, my friend was going
to California to do a shoot.


175
00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:03.640
I went to set with her,
and, you know, I had big boobs,


176
00:08:03.765 --> 00:08:06.225
so they thought I did porn, and
I was like, "No, no, no, no."


177
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:09.646
And they wanted to do
some test shots.


178
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.065
Five days later, the owner of
Wicked wanted to meet with me,


179
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.900
and they offered me a contract.

180
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:15.526
I didn't even know
what that meant.


181
00:08:15.652 --> 00:08:19.405
I remember a phone call
I got from her in 2002.


182
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.450
She was approached
by Wicked Pictures.


183
00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:25.370
She was a little hesitant,
and she wanted my opinion.


184
00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:28.623
And I told her, "Stormy,
this is your opportunity."


185
00:08:28.748 --> 00:08:33.044
She used all of her abilities
to pull herself up


186
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.464
by her bootstraps
and get out of Baton Rouge.


187
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:38.383
This is on the side
of my first Wicked movie.


188
00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:40.802
It was called "Heat."

189
00:08:40.927 --> 00:08:43.012
I had such a huge, long career

190
00:08:43.137 --> 00:08:47.100
where I was never asked to do
something I didn't want to do,


191
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:51.980
especially with my body
or sexually.


192
00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:53.648
King:
She had a strategy.


193
00:08:53.773 --> 00:08:57.360
She wasn't just a pretty face
who wanted to be famous.


194
00:08:57.485 --> 00:09:00.738
No, she wanted to be a director,
she wanted to be a writer.


195
00:09:00.863 --> 00:09:02.991
What a way to start.
Right, guys?


196
00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:04.867
She had vision.

197
00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:08.329
She's a disturbingly smart
porn star.


198
00:09:08.454 --> 00:09:11.291
King: At Wicked, it was like,
"What can we do different


199
00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:14.043
so that women can have it
be their fantasy,


200
00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:15.795
not just his fantasy?"

201
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.297
Action.

202
00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:19.507
King: And we were successful
in large part


203
00:09:19.632 --> 00:09:23.052
due to the movies
that Stormy directed.


204
00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:42.155
Daniels: In 2006, I was young
and naive and single,


205
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.450
and I had no idea
what was about to happen.


206
00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:47.410
Man: Love you!

207
00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:56.085
Daniels:
I was working at a charity
golf tournament


208
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.338
in Lake Tahoe in 2006.

209
00:09:58.463 --> 00:09:59.631
The company I worked for,
Wicked Pictures,


210
00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:01.591
had sponsored a hole,

211
00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:03.718
which meant that, you know,
the golfers come around,


212
00:10:03.843 --> 00:10:07.555
we give them water.
We had a table and a gift room.


213
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.433
That day, I took pictures
with other celebrities


214
00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:14.520
that are exactly the same
as the picture of me and Trump.


215
00:10:16.064 --> 00:10:19.901
Donald Trump was basically
just a goofy reality TV star.


216
00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:23.488
Mr. Trump, here you go.
Three medium pizzas, $5 each.


217
00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:24.739
Tell you what.

218
00:10:24.864 --> 00:10:26.741
I'll counter that offer
with an even better one.


219
00:10:26.866 --> 00:10:29.202
Here's the deal.
You give me those three pizzas,


220
00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:33.164
only I'll give you
just $5 a piece.


221
00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:34.999
Daniels: I knew him
from "The Apprentice,"


222
00:10:35.124 --> 00:10:36.501
which I had never
actually watched,


223
00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:38.378
but there was commercials
and billboards, obviously,


224
00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:40.838
and from a P.R. stunt
he had done on, like,


225
00:10:40.964 --> 00:10:42.465
WWE Wrestling.

226
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.802
Announcer:
The battle of the billionaires!


227
00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:48.179
Daniels: I knew who he was
from those things,


228
00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:49.555
but I didn't know
him personally.


229
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:53.810
And who would really
take him seriously?


230
00:10:53.935 --> 00:10:55.478
Look over here, Bridget.

231
00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:57.313
He was a playboy.

232
00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:59.816
And he was
used to getting his way.


233
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:06.698
**

234
00:11:06.823 --> 00:11:10.451
When Donald Trump invited me
to dinner, I said, "Fuck no."


235
00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:16.249
He was 60, and I was 27,
just doing my job.


236
00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:19.419
But I talked to my publicist,
and he was like,


237
00:11:19.544 --> 00:11:21.588
"I think you should do it.
Just -- Just go.


238
00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:23.756
At least you'll get
a good laugh out of it.


239
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:25.925
You have a good story."

240
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.635
We were supposed to have dinner

241
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.763
at one of the restaurants
in this very nice hotel.


242
00:11:30.888 --> 00:11:33.308
I was a little bit early,
but he said, "Just come up.


243
00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:35.435
We'll meet up here,
and we'll go down."


244
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.979
So that's how I ended up
going up to his room.


245
00:11:38.104 --> 00:11:45.486
**

246
00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:49.866
I walk in, but he wasn't
dressed for dinner yet.


247
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:52.911
He was in black silk pajamas,
which I promptly made fun of him


248
00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:54.746
for and told him to go
put some fucking clothes on,


249
00:11:54.871 --> 00:11:57.916
Hefner wanted his PJs back,
and he complied.


250
00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:59.792
**

251
00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:02.879
This hotel room was bigger
than my apartment.


252
00:12:03.004 --> 00:12:06.799
It wasn't like I walked into
his room and sat on the bed.


253
00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:10.678
We did actually have
a good conversation.


254
00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:13.556
We had this rapport
that wasn't sexual at all.


255
00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:17.352
He didn't ask me about sex
or who I like.


256
00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:19.270
He wanted to know
the business side


257
00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:21.272
and my visions as a director.

258
00:12:21.397 --> 00:12:23.274
And I actually signed
a copy of my movie,


259
00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.359
"3 Wishes," for him
that I wrote


260
00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:25.902
and directed and starred in,

261
00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:28.404
but he wasn't interested
in the sexual performances.


262
00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:30.365
It was all about business.

263
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.660
And we had water.
Nothing else.


264
00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:35.745
**

265
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:41.209
Did not get any bad vibes
or sexual innuendos or nothing.


266
00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:44.420
He said, "You're
actually really smart."


267
00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.756
Somehow the conversation
about "Celebrity Apprentice"


268
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:50.843
came up, and his angle was,
"I'll get a lot of attention


269
00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:55.765
for putting this blond
adult actress on TV."


270
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.811
And I was like, "NBC would never
let me on television."


271
00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:03.940
And that's when he's like,
"Every season,


272
00:13:04.065 --> 00:13:07.944
I get to pick one person
that they can't overrule.


273
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:09.654
It's my wild card."

274
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.531
**

275
00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:12.782
He spun into me as, "Well,

276
00:13:12.907 --> 00:13:14.492
you want to be
a mainstream director,


277
00:13:14.617 --> 00:13:16.327
you want to direct music
videos and horror movies,"


278
00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:17.829
because we had
talked about that,


279
00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:19.205
and I said, "Yeah."
He goes, "Well, this is a chance


280
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.541
for you to be on TV
and show people


281
00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:26.254
that you're not
just what you look like."


282
00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:30.300
He told me
I reminded him of his daughter.


283
00:13:30.425 --> 00:13:33.177
I felt like he was being
sympathetic to me.


284
00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:35.054
Ivanka is beautiful,
and she's blond,


285
00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:38.725
and I'm sure she's had people
assume that she's an idiot.


286
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.811
But I felt like,
as this father figure,


287
00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:44.647
who has watched his daughter
be treated


288
00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:48.067
a certain way,
could identify with me.


289
00:13:48.192 --> 00:13:49.736
I thought we had
this mutual respect.


290
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:52.363
**

291
00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:54.991
Which is why I was so crazy

292
00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:59.287
when, having no red flags
whatsoever in a conversation,


293
00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:01.122
I came out of a bathroom
to find myself cornered.


294
00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:05.668
**

295
00:14:05.793 --> 00:14:08.046
I don't remember
how I got on the bed,


296
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:09.631
and then,
the next thing I know,


297
00:14:09.756 --> 00:14:14.218
it was humping away
and telling me how great I was.


298
00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:15.929
It was awful.

299
00:14:16.054 --> 00:14:20.016
**

300
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:21.768
But I didn't say no.

301
00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:26.522
**

302
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.819
At the time, I was doing a lot
of photo shoots in L.A.,


303
00:14:31.945 --> 00:14:34.072
and Trump had this uncanny knack
for calling me


304
00:14:34.197 --> 00:14:35.823
when I was in the makeup chair.

305
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:39.369
He was calling me at least
once a week, sometimes more.


306
00:14:39.494 --> 00:14:41.079
Profess his love,
begged to see me again,


307
00:14:41.204 --> 00:14:43.248
call me "honey bunch."

308
00:14:43.373 --> 00:14:46.626
It's not a secret.
It never was.


309
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:49.712
Donald Trump was obsessed
with crafting his public image


310
00:14:49.837 --> 00:14:54.008
as sort of a great
entertainment spectacle.


311
00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:57.845
He had spent years trying
to perpetuate the narrative


312
00:14:57.971 --> 00:15:03.393
in New York tabloids that he was
this very in-demand man.


313
00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:06.354
During his first marriage
to Ivana Trump,


314
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:08.856
he was leaking to the tabloids
about the affair


315
00:15:08.982 --> 00:15:10.942
that he was having
with Marla Maples.


316
00:15:12.443 --> 00:15:13.569
I think it was
very important to him


317
00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:15.613
and remains very important
to him


318
00:15:15.738 --> 00:15:20.493
to be just surrounded
by beautiful younger women.


319
00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.912
Daniels:
I met with him several times.


320
00:15:23.037 --> 00:15:24.998
Five or six.

321
00:15:25.123 --> 00:15:28.960
But the only time we had sex
was that first meeting.


322
00:15:31.004 --> 00:15:34.674
When I met Trump
at the Beverly Hills Hotel,


323
00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:36.759
he sat next to me on the sofa.

324
00:15:36.884 --> 00:15:39.095
He was obsessed
with watching Shark Week.


325
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.680
He said, "I love your nose.

326
00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:42.682
It looks like an eagle beak.
Regal."


327
00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:46.060
I'm like, "That is not
a fucking compliment."


328
00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:47.353
Can't forget that.

329
00:15:47.478 --> 00:15:48.605
One of
the specific things he said,


330
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.023
he's like,
"I donate to charities,


331
00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:52.108
and people hit me up
all the time to want me


332
00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:53.526
to make donations and money,"
and he goes, "And they're fine,


333
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.069
they're good because
they're tax write-offs.


334
00:15:55.194 --> 00:15:58.072
But I would never give a dime
to a shark rescue."


335
00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:00.116
He hates sharks.

336
00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:03.494
I would say it's a phobia.

337
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.496
Trump wanted to have sex,

338
00:16:05.622 --> 00:16:07.123
but I lied and told him
I was on my period


339
00:16:07.248 --> 00:16:08.166
so he wouldn't try.

340
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.752
He would invite me to things.

341
00:16:10.877 --> 00:16:12.879
I blew him off way
more than I said yes.


342
00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:14.464
It's a vodka
that people really like,


343
00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:17.175
and as you know,
it's taken off like crazy.


344
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.217
Man:
Say hello.


345
00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:19.177
Daniels: Hello.

346
00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:20.303
Man: Introduce yourself.

347
00:16:20.428 --> 00:16:22.096
I'm Stormy Daniels.

348
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:25.016
So, Stormy, when's your
next mainstream appearance?


349
00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:28.311
Um, "Knocked Up."
It'll be in theaters in June.


350
00:16:28.436 --> 00:16:31.689
Daniels:
Trump called me when I was
on the set of "Knocked Up."


351
00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:33.650
That's where I met Seth Rogen.

352
00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:34.692
Seth!

353
00:16:34.817 --> 00:16:36.861
Now, that's how you
get pink eye.


354
00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:39.072
Rogen: I've known
Stormy Daniels a long time.


355
00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:44.202
Uh, and at the time,
when you ask a porn star


356
00:16:44.327 --> 00:16:45.578
who they've been sleeping with

357
00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:46.913
and the answer was,
"Donald Trump,"


358
00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:49.082
it was, like,
the least surprising thing


359
00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:51.084
that she could have said.

360
00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:54.462
From my memory, we were like,
"What's up with the hair?


361
00:16:54.587 --> 00:16:56.005
Like, what's going on
with the hair?"


362
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.174
And she was like, "Oh,
I asked him about the hair."


363
00:16:58.299 --> 00:17:02.387
He said to her that he had had
a dream like, uh,


364
00:17:02.512 --> 00:17:03.805
Samson and Delilah

365
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.556
and that he, like,
felt as though his power,


366
00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:07.767
like, rested in his hair,
and that if he lost it,


367
00:17:07.892 --> 00:17:10.144
he would lose his, like,
power and his stature.


368
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.563
And that's why, even though
he knows it's ridiculous


369
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:14.482
and like, holding --
you know, not --


370
00:17:14.607 --> 00:17:16.693
you know,
like, objectively not passing


371
00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:18.778
all the --
the check marks,


372
00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:20.655
you would want a head of hair
to pass,


373
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.658
to him, that is preferable
than cutting it off


374
00:17:23.783 --> 00:17:26.578
because he has, like,
superstitions about it.


375
00:17:26.703 --> 00:17:29.038
Okay. Listen to this debacle.

376
00:17:29.163 --> 00:17:30.456
"The Celebrity Apprentice"

377
00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.875
was still being dangled
in front of me.


378
00:17:33.001 --> 00:17:35.503
I just didn't want it
to be for nothing.


379
00:17:35.628 --> 00:17:39.090
And this went on
for like six months.


380
00:17:39.215 --> 00:17:42.802
Trump called me finally and
said, "I've got some bad news,


381
00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:44.721
and I don't want you
to be mad at me,


382
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:48.474
but I can't put you
on 'Celebrity Apprentice.'"


383
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.560
I was relishing in the
"I told you so"


384
00:17:50.685 --> 00:17:53.313
and kicking myself.

385
00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:56.566
There was no reason for me
to take his calls after that.


386
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:58.568
I thought it was done.

387
00:17:58.693 --> 00:18:00.695
And then someone
had told the story


388
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.990
about me and Trump
to In Touchmagazine in 2011.


389
00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:06.951
If I decide to run,

390
00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:09.078
and that's a big decision
for me...


391
00:18:09.203 --> 00:18:13.666
Nuzzi: In 2011, Donald Trump had
been sort of promoting the idea


392
00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:17.962
to run for president,
and sex still sold.


393
00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:20.715
The story about him cheating
on Melania Trump,


394
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.844
it would be threatening
to his public image


395
00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:27.597
in a way that it really
wouldn't have been


396
00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:29.807
before he got into
presidential politics.


397
00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:31.017
That's a great picture.
Where the hell did you get this?


398
00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:33.770
Nuzzi: But now the story
of Stormy Daniels


399
00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:36.940
probably seemed like it
would be a blockbuster.


400
00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:41.653
I had just given birth,
and someone who knew me well


401
00:18:41.778 --> 00:18:43.237
is definitely
who told the story,


402
00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:46.032
because they have 90%
of the information correct.


403
00:18:46.157 --> 00:18:48.576
I will probably
never know who it was.


404
00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:50.245
I still said no.

405
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.579
Then I was told,

406
00:18:51.704 --> 00:18:53.665
"Well, the story
is gonna come out anyway.


407
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.084
You have two options.

408
00:18:56.209 --> 00:18:58.461
Let it come out anyway
or take control of it,


409
00:18:58.586 --> 00:19:01.547
correct some of the facts,
and make some money off of it.


410
00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:03.299
Otherwise, someone
who's betrayed you


411
00:19:03.424 --> 00:19:04.634
is going to get the money."

412
00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:07.971
So I said yes.
And that's how I met Gina.


413
00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:11.975
Nuzzi: Gina Rodriguez is
a former porn star herself


414
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.644
and a publicist,
and she sort of acted


415
00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:17.063
like Stormy Daniels's agent.

416
00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:23.945
**

417
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.741
The publisher said that I had
to take a polygraph test.


418
00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:31.911
I passed 100%
with flying colors.


419
00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.664
**

420
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:38.710
But in May of 2011,

421
00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:41.170
I was with my daughter,

422
00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:46.676
and I was threatened by someone
I didn't know in a parking lot


423
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:49.012
about the Trump story.

424
00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:51.014
I was very shook.

425
00:19:51.139 --> 00:19:54.809
I did not go to the police
because I was terrified.


426
00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:56.936
So I just didn't say anything.

427
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.106
And then the story
was never mentioned again.


428
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.858
I definitely slept
better after that,


429
00:20:01.983 --> 00:20:03.484
knowing that it was killed
and never coming out.


430
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:13.536
**

431
00:20:13.661 --> 00:20:19.667
**

432
00:20:21.127 --> 00:20:25.089
Trump:
I am officially running


433
00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:28.468
for president of
the United States.


434
00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:30.261
At this point,
Trump is top of the heap


435
00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:32.472
for the Republican nomination
for president.


436
00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:34.974
Woman: Save us! Save us!

437
00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:38.102
Palazzolo:
Stormy's thinking about
the liaison with him


438
00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:41.606
and whether it would be
worth it to sell the story.


439
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:42.815
Daniels:
When Trump had announced


440
00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.776
that he was running
for president,


441
00:20:44.901 --> 00:20:46.152
I really thought that it was

442
00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:48.947
just another
one of his P.R. stunts.


443
00:20:49.072 --> 00:20:51.241
I wasn't worried about it at all

444
00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:54.702
because he had told me
he never wanted to be president.


445
00:20:54.827 --> 00:20:57.872
But then Trump got
the Republican nomination,


446
00:20:57.997 --> 00:21:00.166
and that's when shit got real.

447
00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:04.420
Palazzolo: So in April of 2016,
Gina starts making calls.


448
00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:07.590
One of the first that she makes
is to The National Enquirer,


449
00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:10.843
looking for
like $200,000, $250,000.


450
00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.178
Nuzzi:
The National Enquirerwas owned


451
00:21:12.303 --> 00:21:15.306
by American Media, Inc.,
also known as AMI,


452
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:17.392
and the C.E.O. of that company
at the time


453
00:21:17.517 --> 00:21:21.104
was David Pecker,
a friend of Donald Trump's.


454
00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:23.982
Palazzolo: Over the years,
David Pecker and Donald Trump


455
00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:27.110
developed this sort
of transactional relationship.


456
00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:29.904
And David Pecker agreed
to help Trump


457
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:33.866
by intercepting negative
stories about him,


458
00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:35.994
like the nine-month affair
that he had had


459
00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:39.706
with a former Playboy Playmate,
Karen McDougal.


460
00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.834
AMI paid
Karen McDougal $150,000


461
00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:45.962
in exchange for her story about
her affair with Donald Trump,


462
00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:50.341
and the story never came out.
It was a catch-and-kill.


463
00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:58.349
**

464
00:21:58.474 --> 00:22:01.519
Daniels:
My friend was like, "You might
actually have a problem.


465
00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:02.937
I don't want to scare you,

466
00:22:03.062 --> 00:22:06.107
but based on the things
you've told me,


467
00:22:06.232 --> 00:22:10.361
now you're the whole
Republican Party's problem.


468
00:22:10.486 --> 00:22:12.864
And they like to make
their problems go away."


469
00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:14.282
A recording of Donald Trump

470
00:22:14.407 --> 00:22:16.868
made more than a decade ago
has surfaced.


471
00:22:16.993 --> 00:22:18.703
It is lewd.
It is vulgar.


472
00:22:18.828 --> 00:22:22.332
And we caution you, you won't
want young children to hear it.


473
00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:35.094
Palazzolo:
The "Access Hollywood" tape


474
00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:39.474
immediately gave
Stormy's story more salience.


475
00:22:42.852 --> 00:22:44.520
The campaign is more sensitive

476
00:22:44.646 --> 00:22:48.232
to any kind of news coming out
about Trump that's negative.


477
00:22:48.358 --> 00:22:50.318
And so now
The National Enquirer,


478
00:22:50.443 --> 00:22:54.072
they're very much interested
in the Stormy story.


479
00:22:54.197 --> 00:22:55.740
When Cohen finds out
about her story,


480
00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:57.825
he initially goes
to David Pecker,


481
00:22:57.951 --> 00:23:00.119
hoping that, like, Pecker
is going to kill it.


482
00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:01.704
And Pecker's like,
"Not this time."


483
00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:03.122
You know?
"No."


484
00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:10.421
**

485
00:23:10.546 --> 00:23:14.133
Daniels: I was very relieved
when Gina started reaching out


486
00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:17.804
and offering me the chance
to keep it quiet.


487
00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.889
I was fucking terrified.

488
00:23:20.014 --> 00:23:23.434
I mean, people have been
suspiciously killed


489
00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:25.311
for political reasons.

490
00:23:25.436 --> 00:23:27.313
It was really
about two things --


491
00:23:27.438 --> 00:23:29.691
trying to keep the story
from coming out


492
00:23:29.816 --> 00:23:33.945
so that it would not hurt
my husband and my daughter


493
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.364
and I wouldn't lose my life,

494
00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:39.784
and that there would be
a paper trail and money trail


495
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:42.328
linking me to Donald Trump

496
00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:44.998
so that he could not
have me killed.


497
00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:49.085
All I had to do was sign
this piece of paper


498
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.256
and collect $130,000.

499
00:23:55.258 --> 00:23:58.303
Pence: It is my high honor
to introduce to you


500
00:23:58.428 --> 00:24:01.598
the president-elect,
Donald Trump.


501
00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:06.227
Trump: Ours was not a campaign,

502
00:24:06.352 --> 00:24:10.648
but rather an incredible
and great movement.


503
00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:21.576
**

504
00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:23.328
Man:
Breaking news tonight --
The Wall Street Journal


505
00:24:23.453 --> 00:24:25.413
reporting that a lawyer
for President Trump


506
00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:29.667
arranged a hefty payment
to an adult-film star.


507
00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:33.046
Woman: The agreement reportedly
required Stephanie Clifford,


508
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:35.465
who goes by the name
also as Stormy Daniels,


509
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.762
to stay quiet about an alleged
sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.


510
00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:44.557
Woman #2: This House is listed
as the triple-X actress's home.


511
00:24:44.682 --> 00:24:46.267
Daniels:
When The Wall Street Journal


512
00:24:46.392 --> 00:24:47.977
story broke, there was press
in our front yard,


513
00:24:48.102 --> 00:24:49.979
they're beating on the door.

514
00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:51.314
Our daughter answered it,

515
00:24:51.439 --> 00:24:53.066
thinking it was
her little friend,


516
00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:55.193
and someone shoved a camera
in her face.


517
00:24:55.318 --> 00:24:57.028
My daughter couldn't
go out and play.


518
00:24:57.153 --> 00:24:58.613
Glen couldn't leave the house.

519
00:24:58.738 --> 00:25:02.492
Man: Stormy, did you touch
Donald Trump's penis?


520
00:25:03.618 --> 00:25:05.203
I know you don't
want to know about me,


521
00:25:05.328 --> 00:25:06.287
just want to know about her.
So why do you --


522
00:25:06.412 --> 00:25:07.747
Why are you even talking to me?

523
00:25:07.872 --> 00:25:12.835
**

524
00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:16.256
There was no knowledge of any
payments from the President,


525
00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:18.466
and he's denied
all of these allegations.


526
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:24.889
We're hearing old news
from a stripper porn star.


527
00:25:25.014 --> 00:25:26.182
Daniels:
I think the Twitter thing,


528
00:25:26.307 --> 00:25:27.392
I could deal with any of it

529
00:25:27.517 --> 00:25:29.269
because I have
pretty thick skin.


530
00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:32.522
People called me
just a whore or whatever.


531
00:25:32.647 --> 00:25:34.065
But the only name
anyone's ever called me


532
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.734
that really upset me is a liar.

533
00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:43.658
**

534
00:25:43.783 --> 00:25:45.660
They were saying, I made up
these lies about Trump


535
00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:47.120
to make money,

536
00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.580
but I was under
the hush money NDA,


537
00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:51.374
so I was not able to respond
about anything at all.


538
00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:52.917
But Jimmy could.

539
00:25:53.042 --> 00:25:54.711
Please welcome Stormy Daniels.

540
00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:59.215
Do you think the president
is watching right now?


541
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.092
I like to imagine him...

542
00:26:01.217 --> 00:26:03.428
I don't
want to imagine him.


543
00:26:03.553 --> 00:26:06.306
Kimmel: We had Stormy
booked on the show,


544
00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:09.142
and she had a pretty
good sense of humor.


545
00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.686
But I remember that
she was fearful


546
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:14.355
that she would violate
her nondisclosure agreement.


547
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.857
I know you can't answer
any questions


548
00:26:15.982 --> 00:26:19.444
because of this NDA
that you don't have, but...


549
00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:22.530
Stormy puppet perhaps
can answer some questions.


550
00:26:22.655 --> 00:26:24.657
I remember that
she was fearful, in general.


551
00:26:24.782 --> 00:26:27.660
I think that that made sense.
You know, you made an enemy


552
00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:29.662
out of the president
of the United States.


553
00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:33.750
And look who's here with us.
It's Donald in his underpants.


554
00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.962
It's fun to make fun
of Donald Trump. It is.


555
00:26:38.087 --> 00:26:39.380
Stormy,
you look fantastic.


556
00:26:39.505 --> 00:26:41.049
Welcome to
the golf tournament.


557
00:26:41.174 --> 00:26:43.676
But his followers, these people
that he doesn't care


558
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.721
about at all,
some of them are very sick.


559
00:26:46.846 --> 00:26:49.307
And all it takes is one of them
to do something


560
00:26:49.432 --> 00:26:52.518
that could
really ruin your life.


561
00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:56.356
It seems like she's been
on the losing end of this deal


562
00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.775
from day one,
and that's a shame,


563
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.278
because one of the two people
involved is telling the truth,


564
00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:04.197
and it's not Donald Trump.

565
00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.657
Cooper: The New York Times
is now reporting


566
00:27:05.782 --> 00:27:07.408
that Michael Cohen,
the President's lawyer,


567
00:27:07.533 --> 00:27:10.745
says he paid the $130,000
out of his own pocket.


568
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.040
Nuzzi: The hush money NDA
should have prevented her


569
00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.541
from speaking publicly

570
00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.585
about Donald Trump
and their relationship,


571
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.504
and it should have also
prevented Trump


572
00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:21.714
from speaking publicly about it.

573
00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:24.425
But then, a month
after the story broke,


574
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.886
it was reported that
Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen,


575
00:27:27.011 --> 00:27:29.973
was shopping a book proposal
to potential publishers


576
00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:34.227
in which he promised to tell all
about the Stormy Daniels saga.


577
00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.899
As Stormy saw it, the book
proposal violated the NDA,


578
00:27:40.024 --> 00:27:42.443
thus rendering it null.

579
00:27:42.568 --> 00:27:44.153
This meant that
he was attempting


580
00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:45.780
to profit off of her story

581
00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:48.324
when she couldn't even
comment on it publicly.


582
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:49.617
She couldn't defend herself.

583
00:27:49.742 --> 00:27:51.160
She couldn't give
her version of events.


584
00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:53.663
She was furious.

585
00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:56.541
Daniels: Cohen was exploiting me
and using me to make money,


586
00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:59.252
and I had just
fucking had it.


587
00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:02.255
I don't need anyone
to speak for me.


588
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.173
Nuzzi: And so she hired a lawyer
with the hope


589
00:28:04.299 --> 00:28:05.758
of getting out of the NDA.

590
00:28:05.883 --> 00:28:07.385
King: Stormy Daniels
has a new attorney.


591
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.928
His name is Michael Avenatti.

592
00:28:09.053 --> 00:28:11.264
Woman: The porn star is suing
the President.


593
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.766
Stormy Daniels
hoping a judge will rule


594
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:17.812
that nondisclosure agreement
is not valid.


595
00:28:17.937 --> 00:28:21.441
Melber: She is suing this time
not for money, she says,


596
00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.610
but for freedom,
for freedom of speech.


597
00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:26.237
Our position's clear.
He never signed the agreement,


598
00:28:26.362 --> 00:28:27.572
even though he knew
all about it,


599
00:28:27.697 --> 00:28:29.490
and therefore
she's free to speak.


600
00:28:29.616 --> 00:28:31.993
Avenatti understood how
to play outside of the rules,


601
00:28:32.118 --> 00:28:35.038
so he drew Trump into a conflict
that elevated his client,


602
00:28:35.163 --> 00:28:36.706
Stormy Daniels, and himself.

603
00:28:40.793 --> 00:28:42.211
I don't know, man.

604
00:28:42.337 --> 00:28:43.880
Man: No thoughts on it?

605
00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:47.634
10 days after Stormy filed
a lawsuit to get out of the NDA,


606
00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.969
Trump struck back
with his own lawsuit.


607
00:28:50.094 --> 00:28:52.055
Man:
Donald Trump and his personal
legal team firing back


608
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.643
at Stormy Daniels, seeking more
than $20 million in damages.


609
00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:58.895
He was seeking $1 million
for each time


610
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.773
that she allegedly
violated the contract.


611
00:29:01.898 --> 00:29:03.608
Melber: Donald Trump and a lot
of other people


612
00:29:03.733 --> 00:29:05.526
who use the legal system
this way understand


613
00:29:05.652 --> 00:29:07.528
that if you're poor enough,

614
00:29:07.654 --> 00:29:09.030
a money penalty
might ruin your life,


615
00:29:09.155 --> 00:29:13.576
bankrupt your family forever,
make you homeless.


616
00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:15.870
Donald Trump will fight
a 30-front war.


617
00:29:15.995 --> 00:29:18.039
He's never cared about
looking like the bad guy.


618
00:29:18.164 --> 00:29:20.041
Kimmel: Meanwhile,
there are new developments


619
00:29:20.166 --> 00:29:22.043
in the "Hussia" investigation --
that, of course,


620
00:29:22.168 --> 00:29:25.713
being Stormy Daniels,
the adult-film star who may...


621
00:29:25.838 --> 00:29:29.884
She started a GoFundMe
to support her legal bills.


622
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:32.845
And I decided we were
going to mention it on the air.


623
00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:35.390
So now you can give money
to a porn star


624
00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:38.184
just like the president
of the United States.


625
00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:41.854
Man: She's the porn star
making headlines across America.


626
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.109
Now Stormy Daniels is telling
her story on "60 Minutes."


627
00:29:46.234 --> 00:29:49.070
I was offered a lot of money
when the story first broke,


628
00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:52.574
and I chose to do "60 Minutes"
because it wasn't paid,


629
00:29:52.699 --> 00:29:54.576
which meant nobody could say
I did it for the money.


630
00:29:54.701 --> 00:30:01.082
**

631
00:30:01.207 --> 00:30:03.251
Man: Tonight on CBS,
produced with "60 Minutes,"


632
00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:05.378
an interview people waiting for.

633
00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.879
Stormy Daniels tells her story.

634
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.798
Let me grab that,
actually, real quick.


635
00:30:08.923 --> 00:30:10.049
Kayla:
Is it on?


636
00:30:10.174 --> 00:30:11.342
Not yet.

637
00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:12.719
Hey, can she go
play with Paul?


638
00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:15.388
No, I don't want her
going outside.


639
00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.724
There could be press
or something out there.


640
00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:21.144
It's not safe for her
to go out right now.


641
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:25.023
Nicks: How much does she, like,
understand what's going on?


642
00:30:25.148 --> 00:30:27.692
She doesn't know specifics
about what's going on,


643
00:30:27.817 --> 00:30:29.193
and that's
the only problem about


644
00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:30.987
we have to keep the TV off,

645
00:30:31.112 --> 00:30:34.699
because people keep saying
porn starStormy Daniels,


646
00:30:34.824 --> 00:30:36.284
and I'm not ready to explain
what porn is because


647
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:38.161
she doesn't know what sex is.

648
00:30:38.286 --> 00:30:39.787
A couple years ago,

649
00:30:39.913 --> 00:30:42.957
my daughter saw me packing
my feature-dance costumes,


650
00:30:43.082 --> 00:30:44.584
and probably a couple weeks
later, she comes in,


651
00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:47.253
and she's like,
"I know what you do."


652
00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.964
And I said, "Oh.
What do you think I do?"


653
00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:52.634
And she goes...

654
00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:55.595
"You're a spy,
and those of your costumes."


655
00:30:56.804 --> 00:30:58.514
I will guarantee you this.

656
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.560
She will know everything before
someone else can tell her.


657
00:31:02.685 --> 00:31:04.979
That's the most important thing.

658
00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:09.025
Meanwhile, my husband,
this is what he just texted me.


659
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.444
Because he knows, in my moment
of weakness, when he said,


660
00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:14.364
"Can I have --"
Just buy it! Go away!"


661
00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:17.951
Kayla: Stormy Daniels's name is
currently number one on Twitter.


662
00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:19.494
Nicks: Trending --
Trending number one.


663
00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:21.412
Trending number one.

664
00:31:21.537 --> 00:31:24.499
All right.
And "60 Minutes" is second.


665
00:31:24.624 --> 00:31:27.502
I can really appreciate
the witty, like, memes.


666
00:31:27.627 --> 00:31:31.047
Even if they're negative
or derogatory towards me,


667
00:31:31.172 --> 00:31:32.257
I can't help but --

668
00:31:32.382 --> 00:31:34.342
Like, if they're well done...
Right.


669
00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:36.761
...and witty and funny,
I can't help but laugh.


670
00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.596
I don't know
what that says about me.


671
00:31:38.721 --> 00:31:39.931
Everybody's tweeting
about how they're having,


672
00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:42.475
like, Stormy Daniels
viewing parties.


673
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.143
We're ready to
root for and cheer on


674
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.770
and watch Stormy Daniels.

675
00:31:45.895 --> 00:31:47.772
Thanks, everybody,
for coming!


676
00:31:47.897 --> 00:31:50.024
Daniels:
Yeah, a bunch of gay bars
are having, like,


677
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:51.734
dress-up stuff.

678
00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:54.862
Stormy Daniels is
breaking the Internet.


679
00:31:54.988 --> 00:31:57.198
Man: "60 Minutes,"
Stormy Daniels tells her story.


680
00:31:57.323 --> 00:31:58.908
Nick: Here we go.

681
00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:00.910
Cooper: A week and a half
before the 2016 election,


682
00:32:01.035 --> 00:32:03.413
Donald Trump's personal
attorney paid a porn star


683
00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:04.956
named Stormy Daniels

684
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:07.709
to keep quiet about
her alleged relationship


685
00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:10.420
with the Republican candidate
for president.


686
00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:12.505
You had sex with him?
-Yes.


687
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.591
Did you want
to have sex with him?


688
00:32:14.716 --> 00:32:16.009
No. But I didn't --

689
00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.552
I didn't say no.
I'm not a victim.


690
00:32:17.677 --> 00:32:18.803
I'm not --

691
00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:19.971
It was entirely
consensual.


692
00:32:20.096 --> 00:32:21.723
Oh, yes.

693
00:32:21.848 --> 00:32:24.976
But in May 2011, Daniels agreed
to tell her story


694
00:32:25.101 --> 00:32:28.062
to a sister publication
ofIn Touch magazine.


695
00:32:28.187 --> 00:32:30.607
The story never ran
because Michael Cohen


696
00:32:30.732 --> 00:32:32.025
threatened to sue.

697
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.319
Daniels says
she was never paid,


698
00:32:34.444 --> 00:32:36.237
and says, a few weeks later,

699
00:32:36.362 --> 00:32:39.032
she was threatened
by a man who approached her.


700
00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:42.785
A guy walked up on me
and said to me,


701
00:32:42.911 --> 00:32:44.954
"Leave Trump alone.
Forget the story."


702
00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:47.665
And then he leaned around and
looked at my daughter and said,


703
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.875
"A beautiful little girl.
It'd be a shame


704
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.209
if something happened
to her mom."


705
00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.711
And then he was gone.

706
00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.630
Avenatti:
This is about the extent.


707
00:32:53.755 --> 00:32:56.549
That Mr. Cohen
and the President


708
00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:59.344
have gone to intimidate
this woman,


709
00:32:59.469 --> 00:33:01.721
to silence her,
to threaten her,


710
00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:04.849
and to put her
under their thumb.


711
00:33:04.974 --> 00:33:08.770
It is thuggish behavior
from people in power,


712
00:33:08.895 --> 00:33:10.897
and it has no place
in American democracy.


713
00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.190
A lot of lady boners
going on right now.


714
00:33:12.315 --> 00:33:13.816
Oh, yeah.

715
00:33:13.942 --> 00:33:16.277
Melber: New reports tonight show
it was the most watched episode


716
00:33:16.402 --> 00:33:19.906
in over a decade --

717
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:25.036
Daniels talking all
about Donald Trump.


718
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:26.788
With respect to that interview,

719
00:33:26.913 --> 00:33:28.665
I will say the President
strongly,


720
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.585
clearly, and has consistently
denied these underlying claims.


721
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.712
And the only person
who's been inconsistent


722
00:33:34.837 --> 00:33:37.757
is the one making the claims.

723
00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:40.009
**

724
00:33:40.134 --> 00:33:43.012
Nuzzi:
In the aftermath of Stormy's
"60 Minutes" appearance,


725
00:33:43.137 --> 00:33:44.931
the White House
went on the defensive.


726
00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:47.016
They attacked
Stormy's credibility,


727
00:33:47.141 --> 00:33:49.477
and they said that the encounter
with Donald Trump


728
00:33:49.602 --> 00:33:51.938
at Lake Tahoe never happened.

729
00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:54.732
Daniels: After "60 minutes,"
the backlash was awful,


730
00:33:54.857 --> 00:33:57.860
especially from
Trump supporters.


731
00:33:57.986 --> 00:34:00.488
I had these crazy messages
and tweets.


732
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.784
And I was freaking out.

733
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:09.747
**

734
00:34:09.872 --> 00:34:11.916
Daniels:
This car fucking sucks.


735
00:34:18.214 --> 00:34:19.716
There he is.

736
00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.759
Call 911.

737
00:34:21.884 --> 00:34:24.679
What the fuck are you doing?!

738
00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.015
Call the police.

739
00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:32.020
Yep. Police are coming.
Congratulations.


740
00:34:33.813 --> 00:34:35.189
Nicks: When I met Stormy,
she was convinced that


741
00:34:35.315 --> 00:34:39.611
she was living in the last weeks
or months of her life.


742
00:34:39.736 --> 00:34:41.237
It sounds insane,
and it is,


743
00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:42.655
but she was also, like,

744
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.198
suing the president
of the United States.


745
00:34:44.324 --> 00:34:46.826
I mean, in the middle
of a kind of -- the kind of


746
00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.661
situation where shit
like that happens,


747
00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:51.039
like conspiracies
are built around.


748
00:34:55.001 --> 00:34:58.171
Yeah. I was completely sure
that I was going to die.


749
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.188
Nicks: Yeah.

750
00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:23.112
Yeah.

751
00:35:24.614 --> 00:35:26.199
Right.

752
00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:30.036
No, I just, um, figured
this is all happening fast,


753
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:31.996
you know, like,
let's just get the footage


754
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:34.249
and we'll just have it,
you know?


755
00:35:36.125 --> 00:35:38.253
Figure out
what to do with it.


756
00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:46.970
Okay.

757
00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:16.624
Yeah.

758
00:36:16.749 --> 00:36:19.335
I mean...

759
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.254
Yeah.

760
00:36:23.756 --> 00:36:26.509
Melber: President Trump
just spoke out on the record


761
00:36:26.634 --> 00:36:28.261
about Stormy Daniels.

762
00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.179
The President
of the United States,


763
00:36:30.305 --> 00:36:33.308
denying he paid Stormy Daniels
for that secret NDA agreement.


764
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.773
Melber: Trump was asked
about it on Air Force One.


765
00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:43.026
And there's a million ways
to handle that,


766
00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:45.153
including walking away.

767
00:36:57.624 --> 00:37:00.960
It's an example of Donald Trump
passing the buck.


768
00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:03.171
So the press then
didask Michael Cohen.


769
00:37:03.296 --> 00:37:08.051
It fed the story in ways
that did clearly hurt Trump.


770
00:37:08.176 --> 00:37:12.013
He definitely made it worse
by just pushing it on Cohen.


771
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.728
Welker: Tonight,
a dramatic FBI raid at


772
00:37:18.853 --> 00:37:21.898
the New York office
and hotel room of Michael Cohen,


773
00:37:22.023 --> 00:37:23.316
the President's
personal attorney,


774
00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:26.027
who paid off adult-film star
Stormy Daniels


775
00:37:26.152 --> 00:37:28.029
for her silence
about her alleged affair


776
00:37:28.154 --> 00:37:30.907
with Mr. Trump 11 days
before the election.


777
00:37:31.032 --> 00:37:32.825
Woman: A watchdog group
filed a complaint


778
00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:34.577
with the
Federal Elections Commission,


779
00:37:34.702 --> 00:37:37.997
alleging the deal involving then
presidential candidate Trump


780
00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:41.000
is a violation
of campaign finance law.


781
00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:43.419
There's a very narrow
set of circumstances


782
00:37:43.544 --> 00:37:48.258
in which who you are having
sex with is newsworthy.


783
00:37:48.383 --> 00:37:51.678
What seemed most interesting
about it from the get-go


784
00:37:51.803 --> 00:37:53.179
was the salacious element of it.

785
00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:55.390
**

786
00:37:55.515 --> 00:37:58.893
But it gets worse in terms
of the criminal law,


787
00:37:59.018 --> 00:38:01.813
potentially,
because the payment to Stormy,


788
00:38:01.938 --> 00:38:03.439
to make her story go away,

789
00:38:03.564 --> 00:38:06.943
came from Michael Cohen's
home-equity line.


790
00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:08.945
And Michael Cohen
does get reimbursed


791
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.613
for having paid that money

792
00:38:10.738 --> 00:38:12.740
in a way that may have affected
Donald Trump's ability


793
00:38:12.865 --> 00:38:13.950
to get into the White House.

794
00:38:14.075 --> 00:38:16.286
But the issue is not her.

795
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:20.373
The issue is --
the issue is the crime.


796
00:38:40.101 --> 00:38:42.020
Thank you, I think?

797
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:43.313
I mean...

798
00:38:43.438 --> 00:38:45.607
I don't even know
what to say to that.


799
00:38:48.234 --> 00:38:49.444
Amateur.

800
00:38:49.569 --> 00:38:52.614
We have to run to the airport
and pick up my husband,


801
00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:55.325
who is flying in that
we were supposed to have


802
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.078
a couple of days
together, alone, kid-free,


803
00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:02.290
to celebrate
our nine-year anniversary,


804
00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:04.542
in Miami, and he booked
a really nice hotel room


805
00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:06.085
and stuff on the beach.

806
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.088
But it got cut a day short

807
00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:12.342
by having to go
to court now tomorrow.


808
00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:16.471
So what was supposed to be,
like, a nice three-day little,


809
00:39:16.596 --> 00:39:22.852
two-night, three-day thing
is now less than 24 hours.


810
00:39:22.977 --> 00:39:24.228
**

811
00:39:24.354 --> 00:39:25.813
Woman:
A federal judge in New York,


812
00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:28.316
has ordered President Trump's
personal attorney,


813
00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:31.569
Michael Cohen, to attend a court
hearing this afternoon.


814
00:39:31.694 --> 00:39:34.030
Federal prosecutors
and Cohen's defense attorneys


815
00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:35.573
will be arguing today

816
00:39:35.698 --> 00:39:38.785
about how FBI-seized material
should be handled.


817
00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:51.673
**

818
00:39:51.798 --> 00:39:52.966
Hi, everyone.

819
00:39:54.884 --> 00:39:56.594
So, for years,

820
00:39:56.719 --> 00:39:59.806
Mr. Cohen has acted
like he is above the law.


821
00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.559
He has openly referred to
himself as Mr. Trump's fixer.


822
00:40:03.685 --> 00:40:06.604
He has never thought
that the little man,


823
00:40:06.729 --> 00:40:12.402
or especially women, and even
more, women like me, mattered.


824
00:40:12.527 --> 00:40:13.611
That ends now.

825
00:40:13.736 --> 00:40:16.447
My attorney and I
are committed to making sure


826
00:40:16.572 --> 00:40:18.825
that everyone
finds out the truth


827
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.827
and the facts of what happened,

828
00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:24.914
and I give my word that we will
not rest until that happens.


829
00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:26.416
Thank you very much.

830
00:40:29.836 --> 00:40:32.505
McCain: It seems like
a publicity stunt on some level.


831
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.756
I mean, because you
didn't have anything


832
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:34.924
to do with the case.

833
00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:36.301
It seemed a little like you

834
00:40:36.426 --> 00:40:38.094
were just trying
to get attention,


835
00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:42.348
which I understand that you're
being sued by our president,


836
00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.976
but it does seem like
you're benefiting a lot.


837
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:47.812
Daniels:
Yes, there's a lot of publicity,
but I didn't do it for that,


838
00:40:47.937 --> 00:40:50.773
because this isn't
what I want to be known for.


839
00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:52.609
As a matter of fact,
I hid for quite a while,


840
00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:55.445
and it's -- it's overwhelming
and intimidating


841
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.489
and downright scary
a lot of times.


842
00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:09.167
Glen: The night I met Stormy,
thought she was pretty,


843
00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:11.169
and I just walked right up
to her and sat down next to her


844
00:41:11.294 --> 00:41:13.254
and just was like,
"Hey, what's up?"


845
00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:15.214
**

846
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.634
I was like, "I would ask you
for your number,


847
00:41:17.759 --> 00:41:19.761
but I know
you'll never call me."


848
00:41:19.886 --> 00:41:21.554
And she was like,
"What makes you think that?"


849
00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.973
And I'm like,
"Well, just look at you."


850
00:41:24.098 --> 00:41:26.976
Daniels:
I'm not really sure what it
was about Glen right away,


851
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:28.478
but the spark was instant.

852
00:41:28.603 --> 00:41:35.109
He was talented and funny
and sweet, and he was hot.


853
00:41:35.234 --> 00:41:37.570
Glen: On paper, who I was
and who she was,


854
00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:41.241
that should have gone up
in flames in about five minutes.


855
00:41:41.366 --> 00:41:45.787
It ended up being
the love of my life.


856
00:41:45.912 --> 00:41:49.249
I knew she was involved
in an adult industry.


857
00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:50.500
She had presented it
as what it was,


858
00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:52.418
and what she had told me
was what it was,


859
00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:56.297
and I was able to either
take it or leave it.


860
00:41:56.422 --> 00:41:59.926
Honestly, it was hard, you know?
But it wasn't.


861
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:03.346
It wasn't harder than leaving
and not hanging out with her.


862
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.224
You don't change
somebody you love.


863
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:07.642
Early on in our relationship,

864
00:42:07.767 --> 00:42:09.686
I was playing a show
at a club in Pittsburgh


865
00:42:09.811 --> 00:42:12.730
and I get a frantic call.
She's crying.


866
00:42:12.855 --> 00:42:14.315
She says,
"I can't do this anymore.


867
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.317
I love you too much.
I need to do this stuff,


868
00:42:16.442 --> 00:42:18.653
but I can't do it
with anybody but you."


869
00:42:18.778 --> 00:42:23.616
Right there is presented a huge,
life-changing decision.


870
00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:28.413
And then, I actually
ended up doing porn.


871
00:42:28.538 --> 00:42:30.748
You think you're invincible.

872
00:42:30.873 --> 00:42:33.001
Your career's going well.

873
00:42:33.126 --> 00:42:36.045
"I can handle this.
I got you, babe."


874
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.965
You don't think, "Oh, wow.

875
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.968
My dick's half the size of
everybody else that does this.


876
00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:44.304
That's not going to be
a problem later down the road.


877
00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.347
That's not going to fuck
with my emotions at all.


878
00:42:46.472 --> 00:42:48.308
That's not going to
make me feel inferior.


879
00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:50.518
That's not going
to give me a complex."


880
00:42:50.643 --> 00:42:55.356
It slowly eroded
my confidence.


881
00:42:55.481 --> 00:42:58.568
She is the type of person
that has the calluses.


882
00:42:58.693 --> 00:43:00.069
You know,
I'll put it in drummers terms.


883
00:43:00.194 --> 00:43:01.571
You play drums for a while,
you have the calluses,


884
00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:03.281
so you can play drums
for a long time


885
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:04.782
and your hands don't get hurt.

886
00:43:04.908 --> 00:43:07.076
She had the mental calluses,
the physical calluses,


887
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:10.496
the walls built up to where she
just fucking took it in stride


888
00:43:10.622 --> 00:43:13.041
and used it
as a badge of honor.


889
00:43:13.166 --> 00:43:16.461
And she's good at that shit,
you know what I mean?


890
00:43:16.586 --> 00:43:19.339
Daniels:
Glen was my third husband,


891
00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:21.132
but this time around,
it was a different


892
00:43:21.257 --> 00:43:24.344
kind of thing completely.

893
00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:27.722
Glen did not know
about the Trump stuff.


894
00:43:27.847 --> 00:43:30.224
He was going through
some really serious


895
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.769
personal demons of his own.

896
00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:35.063
Do you tell everybody
you're with every single person


897
00:43:35.188 --> 00:43:36.898
you had sex with three years
before you meet them,


898
00:43:37.023 --> 00:43:39.567
especially if one of them
is an orange hobgoblin?


899
00:43:39.692 --> 00:43:43.529
No, it was just a conversation
that we had never had.


900
00:43:43.655 --> 00:43:46.741
And I didn't think
it fucking mattered.


901
00:43:46.866 --> 00:43:48.534
Glen: If you're ashamed
of something,


902
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.078
you're probably not going
to tell the people


903
00:43:50.203 --> 00:43:52.163
that are closest to you
because you're ashamed of it.


904
00:43:52.288 --> 00:43:54.207
I guess I can

905
00:43:54.332 --> 00:43:56.251
stand up and be a man
and admit that


906
00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:58.878
because I lied to her
about drinking a lot.


907
00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:02.507
Daniels: I told him that Trump
and I had not had sex,


908
00:44:02.632 --> 00:44:04.425
that I had gone
to the hotel room.


909
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.969
I told him about
"Celebrity Apprentice,"


910
00:44:06.094 --> 00:44:08.304
I had told him that he would
call me all the time.


911
00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:11.808
And he said, "That's it? 'Cause
they're saying you fucked him."


912
00:44:11.933 --> 00:44:14.060
And I was like, "Well, they'll
say that about any porn star


913
00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:16.771
who goes to a rich guy's room."

914
00:44:16.896 --> 00:44:19.732
Glen: The sexual part
I didn't know about.


915
00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:22.735
But the money came
to my bank account.


916
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.570
She said, you know,
"Hey, I got these calls


917
00:44:24.696 --> 00:44:26.656
from Donald Trump's lawyer,"
all this stuff.


918
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:28.366
There's a payment
that they're trying


919
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:29.909
to take care of
for the election."


920
00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:33.121
It was awfully naive of me
at the time


921
00:44:33.246 --> 00:44:36.332
to think
that a $130,000 payment


922
00:44:36.457 --> 00:44:40.378
from somebody that was
a business partner


923
00:44:40.503 --> 00:44:42.630
or a relationship
from 12 years ago


924
00:44:42.755 --> 00:44:45.592
all of a sudden is becoming
a necessity


925
00:44:45.717 --> 00:44:48.511
the week
before a presidential election.


926
00:44:48.636 --> 00:44:50.471
She absolutely lied to me

927
00:44:50.597 --> 00:44:53.683
until I found out
from her attorney on CNN


928
00:44:53.808 --> 00:44:56.060
when all this shit came to light
with the Michael Cohen stuff.


929
00:44:56.185 --> 00:44:58.229
**

930
00:44:58.354 --> 00:45:00.690
Colbert: Adult actress
Stormy Daniels just announced


931
00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:05.945
she'll be dancing as part of the
Making America Horny Again Tour,


932
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.324
which, I got to say,
America needs right now.


933
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.036
Woman: Although Stormy was a
well-known porn actress before,


934
00:45:13.161 --> 00:45:15.622
she's been selling out
performances like tonight's


935
00:45:15.747 --> 00:45:18.082
since coming forward
with allegations


936
00:45:18.207 --> 00:45:20.043
against the President.

937
00:45:20.168 --> 00:45:22.670
Daniels: The only time I took
a break from stripping


938
00:45:22.795 --> 00:45:25.715
was the year and a half
that I had my daughter.


939
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.634
I'm one of the most famous
feature dancers in the world.


940
00:45:27.759 --> 00:45:30.470
I didn't wake up
after the Trump presidency,


941
00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:33.056
like, "I'm gonna make
America horny."


942
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:34.807
The Trophy Club coined that,

943
00:45:34.933 --> 00:45:36.225
and it made it look like
it was my idea.


944
00:45:36.351 --> 00:45:38.061
Team Stormy!
Team Stormy!
Team Stormy!


945
00:45:38.186 --> 00:45:40.730
So, yes, more offers started
coming in for a lot more money,


946
00:45:40.855 --> 00:45:42.690
and the club
started getting filled.


947
00:45:42.815 --> 00:45:44.651
But there was stuff
that I was already doing.


948
00:45:44.776 --> 00:45:46.402
Gibson: Have you guys
ever interviewed her


949
00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:49.530
or, like, met her or...?

950
00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:53.034
No. I mean, I really
don't want to talk about this.


951
00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:54.327
Um...

952
00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:56.454
Yeah, well, let's...
We have to.


953
00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:59.374
So, I have been in the same room
as Stormy Daniels before, yes.


954
00:45:59.499 --> 00:46:03.878
To be clear, it was her
Make America Horny Again Tour.


955
00:46:04.003 --> 00:46:05.546
I was there
for the sole purpose


956
00:46:05.672 --> 00:46:07.298
of trying to get comment
from her.


957
00:46:07.423 --> 00:46:08.716
It was mortifying.
She flirted --


958
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:10.885
I did get motorboated.

959
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.303
Did you know that?

960
00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:14.722
Oh, my God.

961
00:46:14.847 --> 00:46:17.517
Joe actually didn't ask
to get motorboated like that.


962
00:46:17.642 --> 00:46:19.269
No, I did not.
It was not his choice.


963
00:46:19.394 --> 00:46:22.230
No, I did not.
Yeah.


964
00:46:22.355 --> 00:46:25.984
I love my job, and I'm happy
to be here in Detroit.


965
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.995
Woman:
A drunk man threw a wallet
at her, striking her head.


966
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.247
He just wanted to throw
a lot of money at her.


967
00:46:39.372 --> 00:46:41.916
He just forgot to take
the money out of his wallet.


968
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:44.127
Daniels: I'm the sole
breadwinner in my family.


969
00:46:44.252 --> 00:46:45.670
Like, I pay for everything.

970
00:46:45.795 --> 00:46:47.380
If you drive
an ice cream truck


971
00:46:47.505 --> 00:46:49.591
and you've been driving an
ice-cream truck for two years,


972
00:46:49.716 --> 00:46:50.842
and you don't drive it the week

973
00:46:50.967 --> 00:46:52.802
of the heat wave,
you're an idiot.


974
00:46:52.927 --> 00:46:54.554
Man: She's all about
making money and getting


975
00:46:54.679 --> 00:46:56.556
her 15 minutes, you know?

976
00:46:56.681 --> 00:46:59.684
So she comes out
with this thing about Trump.


977
00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:01.144
Woman:
You don't believe it?


978
00:47:01.269 --> 00:47:02.812
No, I believe it.

979
00:47:02.937 --> 00:47:06.149
Crawford: April 2018, I got
a phone call from Stormy.


980
00:47:06.274 --> 00:47:09.777
She told me, "Hey, I need
somebody that I can trust,


981
00:47:09.902 --> 00:47:11.195
and you're it."

982
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.490
I had obviously never traveled
with Stormy in a capacity


983
00:47:14.616 --> 00:47:18.661
that involved security
and a journalist.


984
00:47:19.954 --> 00:47:22.540
It was a lot of fun,
but I was often scared.


985
00:47:24.083 --> 00:47:25.960
The crowds were getting bigger,
and people


986
00:47:26.085 --> 00:47:29.964
were protesting outside
of every club with signs.


987
00:47:30.089 --> 00:47:32.759
Security guards would
report people showing up,


988
00:47:32.884 --> 00:47:35.094
trying to bring guns in,
knives in.


989
00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.847
It was terrifying.
It was...


990
00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:42.101
Fuck, it was hell.

991
00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.437
And Stormy wanted to keep

992
00:47:44.562 --> 00:47:46.147
the whole thing
away from her daughter.


993
00:47:46.272 --> 00:47:48.816
Daniels: I can't be home
for more than 24 hours


994
00:47:48.942 --> 00:47:51.235
because then press parks
in my fucking front yard,


995
00:47:51.361 --> 00:47:52.946
and she can't ride her bike.

996
00:47:53.071 --> 00:47:54.739
She can't be a kid.
She can't be a kid.


997
00:47:54.864 --> 00:47:56.908
I have
to stay away from her.


998
00:47:57.033 --> 00:47:58.576
And so far, her name
and her photo


999
00:47:58.701 --> 00:47:59.994
hasn't been
splashed everywhere.


1000
00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:01.955
And it shouldn't be
because once that happens...


1001
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.665
It's coming.
Like...


1002
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.376
...life gets difficult for her.
And a 7-year-old


1003
00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:08.962
should not have
to live with that.


1004
00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:10.880
**

1005
00:48:11.005 --> 00:48:12.632
Woman: Stormy Daniels
and her attorney


1006
00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:14.050
have promised
for quite some time now


1007
00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:16.636
that they would be releasing
a sketch of the man


1008
00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:19.222
that Stormy Daniels says
threatened her years ago


1009
00:48:19.347 --> 00:48:24.727
to stay quiet about her alleged
affair with Donald Trump.


1010
00:48:24.852 --> 00:48:27.605
Woman #2: This is going back
to an incident in 2011


1011
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.774
when Stormy Daniels
says a man approached her


1012
00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:32.819
in a Las Vegas parking lot
and threatened her


1013
00:48:32.944 --> 00:48:35.363
and told her to leave
Donald Trump alone.


1014
00:48:35.488 --> 00:48:38.491
**

1015
00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:40.702
Daniels:
Trump retweeted a photo of Glen


1016
00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:43.663
that said that he was the guy
in the sketch


1017
00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:47.792
and called me a con job.

1018
00:48:47.917 --> 00:48:50.420
Glen: Looking on Twitter and
seeing a picture of myself


1019
00:48:50.545 --> 00:48:53.214
on Donald Trump's
Twitter account,


1020
00:48:53.339 --> 00:48:57.051
it's just like, you don't --
you don't plan for that.


1021
00:48:57.176 --> 00:49:00.471
Daniels: I'm agreeing with you.
You are entitled to feel


1022
00:49:00.597 --> 00:49:03.474
everything you're feeling.
Like...


1023
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.186
You're hurt, you're jealous,
you're sad, you're scared.


1024
00:49:07.312 --> 00:49:08.855
You're worried.

1025
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.693
Like, all of that
is 100% justified.


1026
00:49:13.818 --> 00:49:14.944
I'm not telling you
to get over it.


1027
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:16.904
I'm not telling you
to grow up.


1028
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.032
I'm not telling you that
I don't understand how you feel.


1029
00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:21.200
Like, I feel
all the exact same thing.


1030
00:49:21.326 --> 00:49:25.788
Like I said, the President
tweeted a photo of you, Glen.


1031
00:49:25.914 --> 00:49:27.540
Like...

1032
00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.542
He hasn't tweeted
a photo of anyone else.


1033
00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:32.170
You're the only person
in the entire universe


1034
00:49:32.295 --> 00:49:37.091
that this is happening to,
and you're all alone.


1035
00:49:37.216 --> 00:49:39.260
I get it.

1036
00:49:39.385 --> 00:49:40.595
Like, I don't
want to be here.


1037
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.807
I don't want to be fucking
stripping when I'm 45.


1038
00:49:44.933 --> 00:49:47.894
Glen: I felt alone.
It's not about, "Oh, my God,


1039
00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:49.854
I can't believe
you fucked Donald Trump."


1040
00:49:49.979 --> 00:49:52.941
It's about the fact
that a lot of other things


1041
00:49:53.066 --> 00:49:55.276
started to unravel
because of that.


1042
00:49:55.401 --> 00:50:02.825
**

1043
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:05.995
Daniels: Michael Avenatti
had done a lot of things


1044
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.206
without telling me he was going
to necessarily do them.


1045
00:50:08.331 --> 00:50:10.583
I found out he actually filed
the defamation suit


1046
00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:12.085
by reading
about it on Twitter.


1047
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:17.590
**

1048
00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.885
I figured that Michael's
main goal


1049
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.556
was to be able
to depose Trump.


1050
00:50:25.682 --> 00:50:30.144
You need really
solid false claims


1051
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:32.939
for a solid defamation case
rather than opinion.


1052
00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:37.151
**

1053
00:50:37.277 --> 00:50:39.320
Daniels: I remember saying to
him, like, "Yeah,


1054
00:50:39.445 --> 00:50:41.572
Trump called me a con job.
I get called way worse,


1055
00:50:41.698 --> 00:50:44.033
by the minute, every day."

1056
00:50:44.158 --> 00:50:45.827
Looking back, I didn't
realize the gravity of that


1057
00:50:45.952 --> 00:50:47.745
was like Trump
basically called me a liar,


1058
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.122
and that is actually
defamation.


1059
00:50:49.247 --> 00:50:51.791
But it wasn't what
I wanted to focus on.


1060
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:53.793
Nuzzi: Anytime Trump is on
the receiving end


1061
00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:56.629
of any allegation
from any woman,


1062
00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:58.756
his standard playbook
is to attack,


1063
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.842
attack, attack,
and to defame.


1064
00:51:00.967 --> 00:51:03.428
You've called women
you don't like "fat pigs"


1065
00:51:03.553 --> 00:51:05.305
and "disgusting animals."

1066

1067
00:51:06.764 --> 00:51:08.474
Only Rosie O'Donnell.

1068
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.978
Nuzzi: Whereas, for Stormy,
what the general public saw


1069
00:51:12.103 --> 00:51:14.981
was a woman not afraid
to fight back


1070
00:51:15.106 --> 00:51:18.192
against the sitting president
of the United States.


1071
00:51:18.318 --> 00:51:24.365
She was liberated, and she
didn't seem scared of him.


1072
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:28.161
**

1073
00:51:32.749 --> 00:51:33.958
Earhardt: Thank you so much for
being with us, Mr. President.


1074
00:51:34.083 --> 00:51:35.376
Trump: Well, good morning.

1075
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:36.920
And I picked a very,
very special day


1076
00:51:37.045 --> 00:51:38.046
because it's
Melania's birthday.


1077
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:39.380
So happy birthday to Melania.

1078
00:51:39.505 --> 00:51:41.049
Kilmeade:
Let's talk about Michael Cohen.


1079
00:51:41.174 --> 00:51:43.426
He's going to be
taking the Fifth.


1080
00:51:43.551 --> 00:51:45.595
What's your reaction to that,
being that you worked with him


1081
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.096
for a couple of decades?

1082
00:51:47.221 --> 00:51:49.015
Trump: Brian, you know, Michael,
Michael's been on your show,


1083
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.308
I'm sure, a lot.
You know, Michael.


1084
00:51:50.433 --> 00:51:52.185
-We know him.
-A good person.


1085
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.395
Trump: Let me just tell you
that he represents me,


1086
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.607
like, with this crazy
Stormy Daniels deal.


1087
00:51:57.732 --> 00:51:59.067
He represented me.

1088
00:51:59.192 --> 00:52:01.235
And, you know,
from what I see...


1089
00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:02.236
It's so creepy.

1090
00:52:02.362 --> 00:52:05.073
It's the first time
he said my name.


1091
00:52:05.198 --> 00:52:08.451
Two weeks ago, he said
that he knew nothing about me


1092
00:52:08.576 --> 00:52:13.414
or any of that when he was
on Air Force One, right?


1093
00:52:13.539 --> 00:52:17.210
He's starting to do what I said
he was going to do all along.


1094
00:52:17.335 --> 00:52:19.587
He's starting to throw Cohen
under the bus.


1095
00:52:19.712 --> 00:52:22.548
Trump: And I've been told
I'm not involved, right.


1096
00:52:22.674 --> 00:52:25.843
Daniels: I don't think he proved
that he's guilty of anything


1097
00:52:25.969 --> 00:52:28.721
other than publicly,
on Fox News,


1098
00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:31.683
saying that he hired a lawyer
to handle


1099
00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:35.103
"the Stormy Daniels thing,"
so...


1100
00:52:35.228 --> 00:52:36.604
Earhardt:
We want to get to Kanye West.


1101
00:52:36.729 --> 00:52:39.899
He tweeted that he loves you,
that you're his brother.


1102
00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:41.901
Trump:
You know, I have known Kanye


1103
00:52:42.026 --> 00:52:43.194
a little bit,
and I get along with Kanye.


1104
00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:45.905
I get along
with a lot of people.


1105
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.031
Avenatti:
We need to take his deposition.


1106
00:52:47.156 --> 00:52:48.616
We need to put him
under oath.


1107
00:52:48.741 --> 00:52:51.327
We need to find out
exactly what his position is --


1108
00:52:51.452 --> 00:52:54.205
about the agreement,
what he knew, what he paid,


1109
00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.416
what he didn't pay,
what he did about it.


1110
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:59.669
This could be the last nail
in the coffin.


1111
00:52:59.794 --> 00:53:04.090
Stormy Daniels is causing stormy
weather for this president.


1112
00:53:04.215 --> 00:53:08.469
**

1113
00:53:08.595 --> 00:53:11.764
Her being here and
Michael Avenatti being on TV


1114
00:53:11.889 --> 00:53:13.224
all the time reminds us

1115
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:15.727
that we have to get to the truth
about everything.


1116
00:53:15.852 --> 00:53:17.145
Woman: This is a great time

1117
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:19.897
on the #MeToo movement
and standing up


1118
00:53:20.023 --> 00:53:21.399
for what she believes in.

1119
00:53:21.524 --> 00:53:25.111
Anything we can do
to support her, we'll do it.


1120
00:53:25.236 --> 00:53:26.654
Daniels: Suddenly,
I looked out in the crowd


1121
00:53:26.779 --> 00:53:28.406
and it's these groups of women
and they're crying.


1122
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:29.866
"There's no crying
in titty bars!


1123
00:53:29.991 --> 00:53:32.327
What are you guys doing?!"

1124
00:53:39.584 --> 00:53:40.877
There are very often women
at Stormy's


1125
00:53:41.002 --> 00:53:43.254
strip-club performances who

1126
00:53:43.379 --> 00:53:45.757
will come up
while she's dancing.


1127
00:53:45.882 --> 00:53:47.467
And instead
of putting a dollar


1128
00:53:47.592 --> 00:53:49.260
in her G-string,
they'll like, say, "No, no, no,"


1129
00:53:49.385 --> 00:53:52.931
and, like, put it in her hand.
You know, like,


1130
00:53:53.056 --> 00:53:55.183
"No, here.
I respect you."


1131
00:53:55.308 --> 00:53:56.851
Woman: You know, she talks
about the demographic


1132
00:53:56.976 --> 00:53:58.394
that come to her strip shows.

1133
00:53:58.519 --> 00:54:01.439
The white men who used to come
are just gone now,


1134
00:54:01.564 --> 00:54:02.941
and it's hordes of women.

1135
00:54:03.066 --> 00:54:04.442
it's gay couples,
it's immigrants.


1136
00:54:04.567 --> 00:54:06.736
Here to comment
is Stormy Daniels.


1137
00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:11.407
Strong: I'm like a liberal hero,
even though


1138
00:54:11.532 --> 00:54:15.370
I'm a Republican porn star
who loves Sarah Palin, right?


1139
00:54:15.495 --> 00:54:19.165
The selective outrage
and the twisted morality


1140
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.377
of the left
never fails to amaze me.


1141
00:54:22.502 --> 00:54:31.302
**

1142
00:54:31.427 --> 00:54:33.680
Woman: These women came to talk
to Stormy Daniels


1143
00:54:33.805 --> 00:54:34.806
about Jesus Christ.

1144
00:54:34.931 --> 00:54:37.267
**

1145
00:54:37.392 --> 00:54:38.810
It's pretty common knowledge

1146
00:54:38.935 --> 00:54:41.145
that I am
a registered Republican.


1147
00:54:41.271 --> 00:54:43.523
I make the joke
"I go both ways."


1148
00:54:43.648 --> 00:54:46.734
I wasn't trying to be a champion
for #MeToo,


1149
00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:49.237
or for any other movement.

1150
00:54:49.362 --> 00:54:50.863
Originally,
I just did this for purely


1151
00:54:50.989 --> 00:54:52.574
fucking selfish reasons.

1152
00:54:52.699 --> 00:54:55.702
I wanted to stand up for myself
and save my own ass,


1153
00:54:55.827 --> 00:54:57.245
not everyone else's.

1154
00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.706
Woman: She has become this
symbol of the resistance.


1155
00:54:59.831 --> 00:55:01.541
She didn't necessarily
want to become that,


1156
00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:03.960
but it's pretty impossible
to put that genie


1157
00:55:04.085 --> 00:55:06.170
back in the bottle.

1158
00:55:11.092 --> 00:55:12.385
I'm not that special.

1159
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.680
Makes me feel
like a hypocrite.


1160
00:55:15.805 --> 00:55:19.809
I feel like I better
do something that's worthy


1161
00:55:19.934 --> 00:55:25.189
of what they're giving me,
and I don't know what that is.


1162
00:55:29.902 --> 00:55:31.279
No.

1163
00:55:38.202 --> 00:55:41.414
That's what they all keep
telling me to do.


1164
00:55:41.539 --> 00:55:42.457
But...

1165
00:55:42.582 --> 00:55:45.752
that was not
what I set out to do.


1166
00:55:45.877 --> 00:55:48.254
I just...

1167
00:55:51.925 --> 00:55:54.844
just wanted to

1168
00:55:54.969 --> 00:55:57.096
stand up for myself.

1169
00:55:58.514 --> 00:56:00.600
You've got your phone working.

1170
00:56:02.143 --> 00:56:04.103
Yeah, it's hard for me to answer
if you call late at night,


1171
00:56:04.228 --> 00:56:06.940
'cause that's when
I'm usually at work.


1172
00:56:07.065 --> 00:56:08.733
Or if you call really early
in the morning, I'm sleeping


1173
00:56:08.858 --> 00:56:10.693
because I worked really late.
But if you call


1174
00:56:10.818 --> 00:56:15.573
the middle of the day,
like right now, it's okay.


1175
00:56:15.698 --> 00:56:18.117
Most people who go out on tour,
they get a break.


1176
00:56:18.243 --> 00:56:20.328
They get to go home
for a little while.


1177
00:56:20.453 --> 00:56:23.665
But when I went home,
it was dangerous to my family.


1178
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.418
I'm hurting my daughter

1179
00:56:27.543 --> 00:56:32.131
every day that I don't see her.

1180
00:56:32.257 --> 00:56:36.302
She doesn't understand why,
at 7 years old,


1181
00:56:36.427 --> 00:56:40.515
mommy has disappeared
and why daddy cries.


1182
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:49.148
**

1183
00:56:49.274 --> 00:56:51.192
You're way overthinking it.
Glen: No, but --


1184
00:56:51.317 --> 00:56:52.819
You have more important things
to worry about.


1185
00:56:52.944 --> 00:56:54.320
Like, seriously.

1186
00:57:09.711 --> 00:57:11.337
Cooper: Joining us now
for an exclusive interview,


1187
00:57:11.462 --> 00:57:12.589
he's the former mayor
of New York City,


1188
00:57:12.714 --> 00:57:13.965
he is attorney
for President Trump.


1189
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:15.592
Rudy Giuliani is with us.

1190
00:57:15.717 --> 00:57:19.846
Paying some Stormy Daniels
woman $130,000?


1191
00:57:19.971 --> 00:57:24.100
I mean, which is going to
turn out to be perfectly legal.


1192
00:57:24.225 --> 00:57:27.562
No campaign finance violation.

1193
00:57:27.687 --> 00:57:30.398
Cooper: So they funneled it
through the law firm,


1194
00:57:30.523 --> 00:57:34.152
Funneled through a law firm,
and the President repaid it.


1195
00:57:34.277 --> 00:57:36.529
Oh, I didn't know --
He did.


1196
00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:40.283
Nicks: Today,
the seriousness ramped up


1197
00:57:40.408 --> 00:57:43.161
with Giuliani confirming
the President


1198
00:57:43.286 --> 00:57:44.746
knew about the payment.

1199
00:57:44.871 --> 00:57:46.539
Not only knew about it,
but that he paid him back.


1200
00:57:46.664 --> 00:57:47.916
Knew about it,
and paid him back.


1201
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:49.500
So, who's lying?

1202
00:57:49.626 --> 00:57:52.045
Is it Cohen saying
that he mortgaged his house


1203
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.630
and hasn't been paid back?

1204
00:57:53.755 --> 00:57:57.050
Or is it Giuliani saying
that the President paid it back?


1205
00:57:57.175 --> 00:57:58.760
And honestly,
how would he even know?


1206
00:57:58.885 --> 00:58:02.430
Because part of me kind
of believes Cohen, that, like,


1207
00:58:02.555 --> 00:58:04.474
Trump was supposed to pay him
back and fucked him over


1208
00:58:04.599 --> 00:58:06.142
because he's got
such a bad reputation


1209
00:58:06.267 --> 00:58:07.727
about paying people back.

1210
00:58:07.852 --> 00:58:09.729
There's a considerable
amount of evidence


1211
00:58:09.854 --> 00:58:12.315
that's going to come to light
in connection with this case.


1212
00:58:15.818 --> 00:58:17.320
I don't think
I'm going on "SNL"


1213
00:58:17.445 --> 00:58:20.615
because I'm a fantastic
actress comedian,


1214
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.076
and they've invited me on
because I'm so talented,


1215
00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:25.203
even though they should.

1216
00:58:25.328 --> 00:58:29.165
I think
it's because of scandal.


1217
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:30.667
Crawford:
I feel like you're also


1218
00:58:30.792 --> 00:58:34.545
going on because a lot
of people are backing you.


1219
00:58:34.671 --> 00:58:37.674
You're standing up to a bully.
That's exactly what's happening,


1220
00:58:37.799 --> 00:58:41.970
and it's looking like
you're coming out on top,


1221
00:58:42.095 --> 00:58:43.429
as you should.

1222
00:58:43.554 --> 00:58:45.974
I see.

1223
00:58:46.099 --> 00:58:49.435
It's just, like, this constant
fucking roller coaster.


1224
00:58:53.147 --> 00:58:55.358
"Welcome to Studio 8
-H.

1225
00:58:55.483 --> 00:58:57.819
From Lorne and everyone
here at 'SNL.'"


1226
00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.864
Nicks:

1227
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.784
Coolest thing ever.

1228
00:59:07.495 --> 00:59:10.206
Woman: Yes!

1229
00:59:18.965 --> 00:59:20.300
Woman: What?

1230
00:59:24.304 --> 00:59:25.680
Okay.
That's Okay.


1231
00:59:25.805 --> 00:59:27.056
No, it's so good.

1232
00:59:27.181 --> 00:59:29.267
Okay.
Perfect.


1233
00:59:35.023 --> 00:59:37.066
Yes. Sorry.

1234
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:38.610
I'm wearing underwear.

1235
00:59:38.735 --> 00:59:40.320
I didn't wear underwear
to court.


1236
00:59:40.445 --> 00:59:42.697
I didn't wear underwear
to "The View."


1237
00:59:42.822 --> 00:59:46.826
I didn't wear underwear
to "60 Minutes."


1238
00:59:46.951 --> 00:59:49.579
Trying to class it up
a little bit.


1239
00:59:49.704 --> 00:59:52.290
Jones:
Stormy Daniels.


1240
00:59:52.415 --> 00:59:53.499
Dwayne, will you take a picture?

1241
00:59:53.625 --> 00:59:54.667
Woman:
I was hitting on Leslie.


1242
00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:56.294
I know.

1243
00:59:58.171 --> 00:59:59.339
Thank you.

1244
00:59:59.464 --> 01:00:01.049
Mr. Trump, I don't know
what to do.


1245
01:00:01.174 --> 01:00:03.051
You keep changing your story
on the Stormy Daniels payment.


1246
01:00:03.176 --> 01:00:05.762
Look, let's get Rudy Giuliani
on the phone.


1247
01:00:05.887 --> 01:00:07.430
He'll fix this.
He's got the sharpest legal mind


1248
01:00:07.555 --> 01:00:09.015
since "My Cousin Vinny."

1249
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.893
Rudy, is that you?

1250
01:00:12.018 --> 01:00:15.021
Yes. That's right.

1251
01:00:15.146 --> 01:00:16.606
It's me.

1252
01:00:27.909 --> 01:00:30.578
Call up Stormy Daniels
and fix this once and for all.


1253
01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:37.502
Hello?

1254
01:00:37.627 --> 01:00:40.129
Stormy?
This is Michael Cohen.


1255
01:00:40.255 --> 01:00:41.798
Are you alone?

1256
01:00:41.923 --> 01:00:42.966
Yes.

1257
01:00:43.091 --> 01:00:43.925
And what
are you wearing?


1258
01:00:45.718 --> 01:00:47.387
Excuse me?

1259
01:00:47.512 --> 01:00:49.681
Okay, Michael,
I can take it from here.


1260
01:00:49.806 --> 01:00:51.975
Sorry, Donald.
It's too late for that.


1261
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.185
I know you don't believe
in climate change,


1262
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.479
but a storm's a-comin',
baby.


1263
01:00:58.439 --> 01:01:01.943
I've never been so scared
and so horny at the same time.


1264
01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:05.571
Both: And live from New York,
it's "Saturday Night"!


1265
01:01:05.697 --> 01:01:15.582
**

1266
01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:23.506
**

1267
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:25.341
We're just here to support
our president.


1268
01:01:25.466 --> 01:01:28.595
-She's an American hero, sir.
-Yeah, that's the problem.


1269
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.179
-It's why we're out here.
-Just take over.


1270
01:01:30.305 --> 01:01:32.640
Yeah.
We got one right now.


1271
01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:35.852
Duran: Under the great laws
of the Golden State,


1272
01:01:35.977 --> 01:01:39.564
I hereby declare it
Stormy Daniels Day


1273
01:01:39.689 --> 01:01:41.983
in the city
of West Hollywood.


1274
01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:46.529
This community has a history
of standing up to bullies


1275
01:01:46.654 --> 01:01:48.197
and speaking truth to power.

1276
01:01:48.323 --> 01:01:51.159
And I'm so very, very lucky
to be a part of it.


1277
01:01:51.284 --> 01:01:54.037
Thank you.

1278
01:01:54.162 --> 01:01:56.748
There's no hate tweets.

1279
01:01:56.873 --> 01:01:58.666
I'm scrolling through Twitter.

1280
01:01:58.791 --> 01:01:59.375
Man: Really?

1281
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.461
Yeah. They're all good.

1282
01:02:01.586 --> 01:02:03.504
Do you understand
how disappointing this is?


1283
01:02:05.298 --> 01:02:07.592
Really?!
Yay!


1284
01:02:07.717 --> 01:02:10.386
City leaders are more interested
in hashtag resisting


1285
01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:14.098
the president than they are
in taking care of the crime


1286
01:02:14.223 --> 01:02:17.352
and the blight and the piles
of trash on our streets.


1287
01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:20.813
A porn star
that extorts the president


1288
01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:23.650
for $130,000
gets a key to the city.


1289
01:02:23.775 --> 01:02:26.277
Man: Sexual predator
in the White House.


1290
01:02:26.402 --> 01:02:28.863
Avenatti:
I think the last 2 1/2 months
have been a warm-up lap.


1291
01:02:28.988 --> 01:02:31.157
I think there's
a lot more information,


1292
01:02:31.282 --> 01:02:32.575
a lot more bombs to drop.

1293
01:02:34.494 --> 01:02:36.829
Oh, Avenatti?

1294
01:02:37.956 --> 01:02:39.999
I saw he was
signing autographs up front.


1295
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.504
Boston.

1296
01:02:53.554 --> 01:02:54.931
Did you like my speech?

1297
01:03:06.484 --> 01:03:09.862
I'm serious.
I'm serious.


1298
01:03:12.115 --> 01:03:13.741
I know, but it's all --

1299
01:03:13.866 --> 01:03:15.201
Keep saying nice things to me
and I'll take my clothes off


1300
01:03:15.326 --> 01:03:17.412
because that's my go-to
defense mechanism.


1301
01:03:19.998 --> 01:03:21.541
Daniels:
Before I met Michael Avenatti,


1302
01:03:21.666 --> 01:03:23.751
I called several lawyers,
and some were just


1303
01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:25.878
immediately like,
"I'm sorry, too hot for us,"


1304
01:03:26.004 --> 01:03:29.382
or, you know,
"We need a minimum $100,000,"


1305
01:03:29.507 --> 01:03:31.259
and like, "No, no, no."

1306
01:03:31.384 --> 01:03:33.720
When I first met him,
I thought he was so generous


1307
01:03:33.845 --> 01:03:37.849
by not taking more
than $100 from me.


1308
01:03:37.974 --> 01:03:40.226
He was the only person
even willing


1309
01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:43.438
to not only help me
and champion for me,


1310
01:03:43.563 --> 01:03:45.106
but believed me.

1311
01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:47.942
Hey, Michael,
we're the...


1312
01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:49.319
Melber: Joining me now is
Stormy Daniels' lawyer,


1313
01:03:49.444 --> 01:03:50.903
Michael Avenatti.

1314
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.946
Michael Avenatti.

1315
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:52.947
Michael Avenatti.

1316
01:03:53.072 --> 01:03:54.866
Lawyers don't normally
do talk shows.


1317
01:03:54.991 --> 01:03:57.285
I'm not
your normal lawyer, I guess.


1318
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.621
Maddow: Michael Avenatti
was doing lots and lots


1319
01:03:59.746 --> 01:04:01.080
and lots of media.

1320
01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:03.833
It struck me that he was sort of
standing as much


1321
01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:05.668
in the spotlight as she was.

1322
01:04:05.793 --> 01:04:07.337
Stelter:
There's been a lot of attention


1323
01:04:07.462 --> 01:04:09.339
about whether you're going
to run for president in 2020.


1324
01:04:09.464 --> 01:04:12.383
How serious are you at this
moment in time about that?


1325
01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:13.718
I'm very serious, Brian.

1326
01:04:13.843 --> 01:04:15.803
If I decide to enter
this fight,


1327
01:04:15.929 --> 01:04:18.097
I think it'll be good
for the Democratic Party.


1328
01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:20.016
Scarborough:
If you look at Michael Avenatti,


1329
01:04:20.141 --> 01:04:23.937
he has done to Donald Trump what
nobody else has been able to do


1330
01:04:24.062 --> 01:04:26.856
since he first rode down
that golden escalator.


1331
01:04:26.981 --> 01:04:30.777
The level of competition
on the other side is pathetic.


1332
01:04:30.902 --> 01:04:32.528
I'm calling him
a pathetically slow learner,


1333
01:04:32.654 --> 01:04:33.738
just so we're clear.

1334
01:04:33.863 --> 01:04:36.032
This guy
is an absolute pig.


1335
01:04:36.157 --> 01:04:38.910
You're the one that refers to
her consistently as a porn star,


1336
01:04:39.035 --> 01:04:40.954
and to me
as a creepy porn lawyer.


1337
01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:42.956
And meanwhile,
you give the President --


1338
01:04:43.081 --> 01:04:44.916
Meanwhile, you give
the President a pass.


1339
01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.793
Why is it
that you don't call


1340
01:04:46.918 --> 01:04:48.628
Donald Trump
the creepy porn president?


1341
01:04:48.753 --> 01:04:51.089
He's the one
that had sex


1342
01:04:51.214 --> 01:04:52.632
with a 4-month-old
son at home


1343
01:04:52.757 --> 01:04:55.927
with my client
without a condom.


1344
01:04:56.052 --> 01:05:01.933
**

1345
01:05:02.058 --> 01:05:05.687
What, you may be asking,
is a "porn star lawyer"


1346
01:05:05.812 --> 01:05:08.022
doing here tonight

1347
01:05:08.147 --> 01:05:13.444
to speak with you about
our party and our republic?


1348
01:05:13.569 --> 01:05:15.613
What are we fighting against?

1349
01:05:15.738 --> 01:05:17.991
An old man with ideas

1350
01:05:18.116 --> 01:05:22.078
about women's bodies
over women themselves.


1351
01:05:22.203 --> 01:05:24.539
Daniels:
He was very charismatic.
The camera loved him.


1352
01:05:24.664 --> 01:05:26.457
He was handsome.
He was charming.


1353
01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:29.127
He was good at his job.

1354
01:05:29.252 --> 01:05:32.171
And what I thought he was doing
for me was so kind and so brave


1355
01:05:32.297 --> 01:05:35.550
that I was fine with him
getting his own stuff,


1356
01:05:35.675 --> 01:05:37.969
you know, as long as it didn't
interfere with my cases.


1357
01:05:38.094 --> 01:05:39.596
Are you trying to
out-Trump Trump


1358
01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:41.055
by using the media?

1359
01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.224
And if so, won't that
be a Pyrrhic victory?


1360
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:44.517
You will have won,

1361
01:05:44.642 --> 01:05:46.561
but at what cost,
Michael Avenatti?


1362
01:05:46.686 --> 01:05:48.104
At what cost?

1363
01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:01.242
Right this minute.

1364
01:06:01.367 --> 01:06:02.702
I'm sure you'll
call me back later and call me


1365
01:06:02.827 --> 01:06:04.370
all sorts of fun names.

1366
01:06:17.175 --> 01:06:20.303
It's not a crusade,
and I did not get caught.


1367
01:06:20.428 --> 01:06:21.971
You just don't get it.

1368
01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:24.015
Glen:
Then tell me what it is.
Tell me what it is.


1369
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.975
I told you
like 100 times.


1370
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.687
It's like talking
to a brick wall.


1371
01:06:29.812 --> 01:06:30.939
Okay.
Then tell me again.


1372
01:06:31.064 --> 01:06:34.192
I'm not -- I'm -- Bye.
Don't call me again.


1373
01:06:35.568 --> 01:06:40.073
**

1374
01:06:40.198 --> 01:06:41.866
Daniels:
Glen started to kind of unravel,


1375
01:06:41.991 --> 01:06:45.119
and we would just fight,
and he would scream at me.


1376
01:06:45.245 --> 01:06:48.873
And it just, like,
went downhill really quickly,


1377
01:06:48.998 --> 01:06:51.876
which was surprising
because we had a really


1378
01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:57.257
good relationship and marriage.
Like, it worked really well.


1379
01:06:57.382 --> 01:06:59.968
Glen: I don't understand
what she did


1380
01:07:00.093 --> 01:07:02.178
and the path that she chose.

1381
01:07:02.303 --> 01:07:07.892
But I think the problems
definitely came to fruition


1382
01:07:08.017 --> 01:07:09.727
in all types of manners.

1383
01:07:09.852 --> 01:07:12.313
Infidelity increased.

1384
01:07:12.438 --> 01:07:15.441
And if we're talking
about that guy, Denver, um,


1385
01:07:15.566 --> 01:07:19.445
I don't like to hold grudges,
but I just...


1386
01:07:21.864 --> 01:07:23.950
I don't know what else to say.

1387
01:07:24.075 --> 01:07:33.960
**

1388
01:07:34.085 --> 01:07:35.295
**

1389
01:07:41.509 --> 01:07:51.394
**

1390
01:07:51.519 --> 01:08:01.404
**

1391
01:08:01.529 --> 01:08:10.705
**

1392
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.041
Sheila:
Hey, babe, it's mom.


1393
01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:15.418
First of all, you know
everything you said


1394
01:08:15.543 --> 01:08:20.214
in thisPenthouse article,
it's just about a lie.


1395
01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.468
You made me sound like
a fucking mean-ass woman,


1396
01:08:23.593 --> 01:08:26.304
and I wasn't mean to you.

1397
01:08:26.429 --> 01:08:30.099
I loved you with all my heart.

1398
01:08:30.224 --> 01:08:33.811
And you were never left alone,
hungry, and scared.


1399
01:08:33.937 --> 01:08:37.190
There was always a babysitter.

1400
01:08:37.315 --> 01:08:41.819
You got everything
you ever wanted.


1401
01:08:41.945 --> 01:08:43.321
So I don't know if this was

1402
01:08:43.446 --> 01:08:45.615
just what you wanted
to let people think


1403
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:48.534
about me or what.

1404
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.828
And you know what?

1405
01:08:50.954 --> 01:08:52.413
I gave you those
pretty titties.


1406
01:08:52.538 --> 01:08:56.334
You just made them
a little bigger by a doctor.


1407
01:08:56.459 --> 01:09:00.880
So you take care of yourself.

1408
01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:03.258
No one ever helped me.

1409
01:09:05.927 --> 01:09:08.429
I mean, you saw the message
from my other neighbor.


1410
01:09:08.554 --> 01:09:12.767
That was a kid
who lived right next door.


1411
01:09:12.892 --> 01:09:14.769
Travis.
He was my best friend.


1412
01:09:14.894 --> 01:09:17.313
He saw everything.

1413
01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:19.524
Stormy's mom...

1414
01:09:19.649 --> 01:09:21.359
She was one of the guys.

1415
01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:26.114
She would party hard, go out
drinking, maybe something else.


1416
01:09:26.239 --> 01:09:29.117
Um, and I remember a time
or two that,


1417
01:09:29.242 --> 01:09:31.160
you know, she didn't come home.

1418
01:09:31.286 --> 01:09:35.832
Daniels: She was always looking
for situations with men.


1419
01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:38.084
And I think that's one
of the bad things


1420
01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:40.336
that I picked up from her.

1421
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:43.506
The only thing I'm addicted to,
or always searching for is,


1422
01:09:43.631 --> 01:09:48.177
is being loved by someone
who actually loves me back.


1423
01:09:48.303 --> 01:09:56.394
**

1424
01:09:59.397 --> 01:10:02.567
**

1425
01:10:02.692 --> 01:10:06.279
This is where I grew up.
There's nothing left of it.


1426
01:10:06.404 --> 01:10:08.031
**

1427
01:10:08.156 --> 01:10:10.241
Everything's closed down.

1428
01:10:10.366 --> 01:10:13.286
Everything's, like, just gone.

1429
01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:17.665
**

1430
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.585
This was my house.

1431
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.086
There's a porta potty

1432
01:10:22.211 --> 01:10:24.547
in the front yard of the house
I grew up in.


1433
01:10:39.479 --> 01:10:41.606
My mom knew there was a neighbor
abusing me


1434
01:10:41.731 --> 01:10:43.775
when I was 9 years old.

1435
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.027
He was a child molester.

1436
01:10:46.152 --> 01:10:47.487
Nicks: You think
he still lives there?


1437
01:10:47.612 --> 01:10:49.530
He died.

1438
01:10:49.656 --> 01:10:50.865
When did he die?

1439
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.201
A long time ago.

1440
01:10:53.326 --> 01:10:55.453
I was sad.

1441
01:10:57.247 --> 01:10:59.332
Because I wanted
to kill him.


1442
01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:12.387
We shouldn't stay here.
It's not safe.


1443
01:11:15.431 --> 01:11:17.225
He did it
to some other girls,


1444
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:18.851
and they went to
the guidance counselor,


1445
01:11:18.977 --> 01:11:21.354
and the police were involved.

1446
01:11:21.479 --> 01:11:22.730
And when to the police
came to the house,


1447
01:11:22.855 --> 01:11:24.524
my mom had me lie
because she didn't want me


1448
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:26.526
to be taken away,
because if I was taken away,


1449
01:11:26.651 --> 01:11:27.777
she didn't get
those child-support checks


1450
01:11:27.902 --> 01:11:29.654
from my father.

1451
01:11:29.779 --> 01:11:33.825
And so the adults at school
believed my friends and not me.


1452
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:37.120
They thought I was just trying
to get attention, and I was--


1453
01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:39.539
I wasn't believed.

1454
01:11:39.664 --> 01:11:42.375
I was in every way
headed down a path


1455
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.002
that should say
that I should be still


1456
01:11:44.127 --> 01:11:46.546
in a trailer park in Louisiana

1457
01:11:46.671 --> 01:11:48.673
and have never seen
or done anything.


1458
01:11:48.798 --> 01:11:53.720
**

1459
01:11:55.722 --> 01:11:58.600
Woman: Controversial adult-film
star Stormy Daniels


1460
01:11:58.725 --> 01:12:01.561
will be performing
in Columbus.


1461
01:12:01.686 --> 01:12:04.606
Sirens telling us she is
going to be in town July 11th


1462
01:12:04.731 --> 01:12:07.275
and 12th at their club.
Daniels claims


1463
01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.028
she had an affair
with President Trump.


1464
01:12:11.946 --> 01:12:16.409
So, we'd been hired for
two nights at Sirens club


1465
01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:21.664
in Columbus, Ohio, and things
got really crazy there.


1466
01:12:28.796 --> 01:12:31.674
I don't believe it.
They're here for something else.


1467
01:12:31.799 --> 01:12:33.718
What's the issue?

1468
01:12:35.762 --> 01:12:38.556
There were two planted
undercover police officers,


1469
01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:41.351
females,
and one encouraged Stormy


1470
01:12:41.476 --> 01:12:44.604
to put her tits in her face.

1471
01:12:57.033 --> 01:12:58.576
The two female officers,

1472
01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:00.119
they were in
the merchandise line.


1473
01:13:00.245 --> 01:13:01.746
They bought shirts.

1474
01:13:01.871 --> 01:13:06.417
They took pictures with her,
hugged her, thanked her,


1475
01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:09.837
and then immediately,
they were ready to arrest her.


1476
01:13:12.632 --> 01:13:15.093
They were trying to get her
on sexual misconduct.


1477
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:33.611
I went to the back of the bus
and counted out $25,000 in cash


1478
01:13:33.736 --> 01:13:39.242
and, uh, sent Denver in at 8:00
in the morning to bail her out.


1479
01:13:39.367 --> 01:13:41.369
That's all we could do.

1480
01:13:41.494 --> 01:13:51.421
**

1481
01:13:51.546 --> 01:14:01.431
**

1482
01:14:01.556 --> 01:14:07.895
**

1483
01:14:08.021 --> 01:14:10.106
Daniels: Well, yes,
I want you to change your plans


1484
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:11.733
so that I can see her.

1485
01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:13.359
But you don't have
to change your plans.


1486
01:14:13.484 --> 01:14:14.819
You can drop her off,
and then you can go do


1487
01:14:14.944 --> 01:14:17.363
whatever you wanted to do.
She's fine with me.


1488
01:14:19.741 --> 01:14:22.827
Awful, but I'll take it.
See you soon.


1489
01:14:26.039 --> 01:14:30.752
Crawford:
The incident in Columbus,
Ohio, kind of caused Glen to...


1490
01:14:30.877 --> 01:14:33.671
I think it was just kind of
the final straw for him.


1491
01:14:35.924 --> 01:14:38.801
Daniels:
My daughter was supposed
to come out and visit me,


1492
01:14:38.927 --> 01:14:43.765
and my friends were going to
pick her up and bring her out.


1493
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:47.477
And she didn't get on the plane.
They couldn't find her.


1494
01:14:49.812 --> 01:14:53.232
Glen didn't answer the phone,
so I panicked.


1495
01:14:53.358 --> 01:14:55.276
I got to Dallas
as fast as possible.


1496
01:15:35.191 --> 01:15:40.488
At the time, I thought I was
never going to see her again.


1497
01:15:40.613 --> 01:15:43.616
Since I might not get
to talk to her,


1498
01:15:43.741 --> 01:15:46.536
I'm going to hide a note
in her bed.


1499
01:15:57.589 --> 01:16:01.718
I come to the house
to see you.


1500
01:16:01.843 --> 01:16:06.222
But you and daddy
were not home.


1501
01:16:06.347 --> 01:16:08.057
You came home?

1502
01:16:08.182 --> 01:16:09.392
Yeah, baby.

1503
01:16:09.517 --> 01:16:12.061
I came looking for you.

1504
01:16:12.186 --> 01:16:13.354
Bye, I love you.

1505
01:16:13.479 --> 01:16:15.523
I love you, too.

1506
01:16:17.775 --> 01:16:19.611
I do understand,
but you don't have


1507
01:16:19.736 --> 01:16:21.946
to go about it this way.

1508
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:27.243
If I have to show up in court,
there will be press,


1509
01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:30.622
and they will be
yelling her name on TV.


1510
01:16:30.747 --> 01:16:33.082
We can get divorced,
and then we can go to mediation


1511
01:16:33.207 --> 01:16:37.170
and have a private
custody agreement with no judge


1512
01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:39.631
so there's no fucking filing.

1513
01:16:39.756 --> 01:16:41.049
And if that's what you'll do,

1514
01:16:41.174 --> 01:16:43.509
then I will give you
fucking full custody.


1515
01:16:43.635 --> 01:16:47.138
And we agree
that I get to see her.


1516
01:16:47.263 --> 01:16:49.766
And I'm only doing that not
because I don't want her...


1517
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.146
...but because
I want to keep her safe.


1518
01:17:00.902 --> 01:17:02.570
Woman:
Stormy Daniels's divorce drama


1519
01:17:02.695 --> 01:17:05.448
is playing out right here
in North Texas.


1520
01:17:05.573 --> 01:17:07.116
Today, News 8 was first
to report her husband


1521
01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:11.079
has filed for divorce,
citing adultery as a cause.


1522
01:17:11.204 --> 01:17:13.957
He was also granted a temporary
restraining order,


1523
01:17:14.082 --> 01:17:16.376
keeping Daniels from taking
their young daughter


1524
01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.753
on her adult tour.

1525
01:17:18.878 --> 01:17:22.382
Glen: I hate that there are
bad times to talk about


1526
01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:25.510
because there was
so many good times.


1527
01:17:25.635 --> 01:17:27.136
I thought we were ride-or-die.

1528
01:17:27.262 --> 01:17:29.180
I thought she was going to say
something crazy, like,


1529
01:17:29.305 --> 01:17:30.723
"Okay, we're going to Cuba.

1530
01:17:30.848 --> 01:17:31.891
We'll just start over,
me and you and her.


1531
01:17:32.016 --> 01:17:33.810
Get the dogs,
put them on the plane.


1532
01:17:33.935 --> 01:17:35.019
Let's go."

1533
01:17:35.144 --> 01:17:36.354
That's not what happened at all.

1534
01:17:36.479 --> 01:17:39.899
What I saw, point blank, was,

1535
01:17:40.024 --> 01:17:42.110
you left me at home
with the kid,


1536
01:17:42.235 --> 01:17:45.571
and you're on a strip-club
tour of North America,


1537
01:17:45.697 --> 01:17:48.116
playing this up
to the high heavens.


1538
01:17:48.241 --> 01:17:49.784
I thought she wanted to be
in the spotlight.


1539
01:17:49.909 --> 01:17:52.203
I thought she wanted
her 15 minutes of fame.


1540
01:17:52.328 --> 01:17:55.206
I didn't see the justification
in any of it.


1541
01:17:55.331 --> 01:17:58.626
And I hate saying that
because she's a great person.


1542
01:17:58.751 --> 01:18:01.754
But I don't understand
what this was about,


1543
01:18:01.879 --> 01:18:05.633
and I still really don't,
to be quite honest.


1544
01:18:05.758 --> 01:18:09.012
Um, I know that
it ripped my family apart.


1545
01:18:14.058 --> 01:18:16.853
Yeah, I can't do this,
Denver.


1546
01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.370
Daniels:

1547
01:18:34.495 --> 01:18:36.164
I'm trying.

1548
01:18:36.289 --> 01:18:37.749
Nicks: Okay.

1549
01:18:37.874 --> 01:18:40.043
I don't know
what else to say.


1550
01:18:43.463 --> 01:18:45.757
Everything
was for nothing.


1551
01:18:49.218 --> 01:18:52.096
Can I be excused now?

1552
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:57.435
And I felt horrible, but I can't
even imagine how Glen felt.


1553
01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.189
It was just not good for him.
But mostly I broke his heart.


1554
01:19:01.314 --> 01:19:05.026
And that is the one thing
in this whole thing


1555
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:06.361
that I regret.

1556
01:19:06.486 --> 01:19:10.531
He really didn't deserve...

1557
01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:15.078
I'm sorry.

1558
01:19:26.756 --> 01:19:28.841
He didn't deserve this.

1559
01:19:34.055 --> 01:19:36.474
And he's a really good dad.

1560
01:19:38.518 --> 01:19:40.228
Sorry.

1561
01:19:47.318 --> 01:19:48.695
Holt: Here in New York,
Donald Trump's


1562
01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.238
former private lawyer,
Michael Cohen,


1563
01:19:50.363 --> 01:19:52.949
accepted his own fate
in a deal with prosecutors.


1564
01:19:53.074 --> 01:19:57.912
Man: Mr. Cohen pled guilty
to two campaign-finance charges,


1565
01:19:58.037 --> 01:20:01.874
both for the purpose of
influencing the 2016 election.


1566
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.793
Holt: Cohen says it was
at the direction


1567
01:20:03.918 --> 01:20:06.129
of then-candidate Trump.

1568
01:20:06.254 --> 01:20:08.131
Woman:
Cohen's lawyer late tonight
is now pushing back


1569
01:20:08.256 --> 01:20:10.049
on the argument
the President's team is making,


1570
01:20:10.174 --> 01:20:13.303
asking if those payments
were a crime for Michael Cohen,


1571
01:20:13.428 --> 01:20:16.264
then why wouldn't they be
a crime for Donald Trump?


1572
01:20:16.389 --> 01:20:17.974
Woman: Did you know about
the payments?


1573
01:20:18.099 --> 01:20:19.392
Trump: Later on I knew.

1574
01:20:19.517 --> 01:20:21.394
And they weren't
taken out of campaign finance.


1575
01:20:21.519 --> 01:20:23.730
That's a big thing.
That's a much bigger thing.


1576
01:20:23.855 --> 01:20:26.941
Because that could be
a little dicey.


1577
01:20:27.066 --> 01:20:29.694
Daniels: Eventually, Cohen
had turned on Trump


1578
01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:32.697
and admitted what he had done.

1579
01:20:32.822 --> 01:20:35.033
But he didn't apologize to me.

1580
01:20:35.158 --> 01:20:39.120
Mr. Trump called me a rat
for choosing to tell the truth,


1581
01:20:39.245 --> 01:20:42.165
much like a mobster
would do when one of his men


1582
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:45.084
decides to cooperate
with the government.


1583
01:20:45.209 --> 01:20:47.962
I had sympathy for him.
I had a lot of hostility, too,


1584
01:20:48.087 --> 01:20:50.131
because he kind of put me
in this mess.


1585
01:20:50.256 --> 01:20:53.760
But he's not the one
that committed the crime.


1586
01:20:53.885 --> 01:20:55.845
And he goes to prison
for something


1587
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:59.223
that he was told to do.

1588
01:20:59.349 --> 01:21:00.934
**

1589
01:21:02.936 --> 01:21:04.562
Janklow: Michelle Obama
has a book coming out.


1590
01:21:04.687 --> 01:21:06.105
Bernie Sanders has a book.

1591
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:08.191
There's a lot of
very, very big books.


1592
01:21:08.316 --> 01:21:10.401
Your fans and people who know
about you and are curious


1593
01:21:10.526 --> 01:21:12.528
about you are going
to buy this book regardless.


1594
01:21:12.654 --> 01:21:15.782
And my goal always is to get
people who are on the fence.


1595
01:21:15.907 --> 01:21:17.408
It's just you have
to get them to


1596
01:21:17.533 --> 01:21:21.120
to overcome their "Fuck
this bitch," and pick it up.


1597
01:21:21.246 --> 01:21:22.956
Look, I trust you
on that.


1598
01:21:23.081 --> 01:21:24.916
Daniels:
Avenatti got me the book deal.


1599
01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:27.293
That's all him.
He got it.


1600
01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:31.214
And I still think
that he may be the devil.


1601
01:21:31.339 --> 01:21:37.262
So I have to be careful
that he's...


1602
01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:38.888
um...

1603
01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:42.976
that he doesn't lose sight
of what I need him to do.


1604
01:21:43.101 --> 01:21:44.477
Everyone's going
to have a reaction.


1605
01:21:44.602 --> 01:21:46.604
It's either going to be like,
"We knew it.


1606
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:47.981
She was in it for the money.

1607
01:21:48.106 --> 01:21:50.900
She did this to be rich,
and fuck her.


1608
01:21:51.025 --> 01:21:52.735
She's a gold digger,"
and the other half


1609
01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.737
is gonna be like, "Fuck yes!

1610
01:21:56.155 --> 01:21:56.948
-He's already up there.
-Okay, great. We'll see --


1611
01:21:57.073 --> 01:21:58.449
I'll come up
in a little bit.


1612
01:22:03.454 --> 01:22:05.456
-I'm Luke. How are you?
-Nice to meet you.


1613
01:22:11.045 --> 01:22:12.171
I have my response.

1614
01:22:12.755 --> 01:22:14.340
Not gonna tell you.

1615
01:22:14.465 --> 01:22:15.842
Okay.

1616
01:22:15.967 --> 01:22:17.510
Do you want him to, like,
have a heart attack


1617
01:22:17.635 --> 01:22:19.220
right here and now?

1618
01:22:20.388 --> 01:22:21.889
Okay.

1619
01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.687
You guys need
some privacy?


1620
01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:30.148
No.

1621
01:22:31.524 --> 01:22:33.776
You can tell me
what you would like it to be.


1622
01:22:49.417 --> 01:22:51.085
Okay.

1623
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:54.255
How did I know you were
gonna say that, regardless?


1624
01:22:55.798 --> 01:22:56.841
She wants to have fun
with it.


1625
01:22:56.966 --> 01:22:58.092
This is --
You know, this is --


1626
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:03.640
Goldberg: Stormy, you have
an announcement to share.


1627
01:23:03.765 --> 01:23:05.683
Tell everybody what it is.

1628
01:23:05.808 --> 01:23:06.768
Oh, you're gonna
let me do it?


1629
01:23:06.893 --> 01:23:08.353
It's your book.

1630
01:23:08.478 --> 01:23:10.396
Oh, you just did it!

1631
01:23:10.521 --> 01:23:13.191
I knew you wouldn't
let me have that.


1632
01:23:13.316 --> 01:23:15.610
I have a book coming out
October 2nd.


1633
01:23:15.735 --> 01:23:16.861
-Wow.
-Cool.


1634
01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:21.157
Avenatti: I think people are
going to be very moved,


1635
01:23:21.282 --> 01:23:23.785
and they're going
to learn a lot


1636
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:26.120
about this
incredible woman,


1637
01:23:26.246 --> 01:23:29.374
who I am proud
to call my client and my friend


1638
01:23:29.499 --> 01:23:31.834
because she's had
an amazing life.


1639
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.087
And this book
is incredibly insightful,


1640
01:23:34.212 --> 01:23:36.923
and I am very anxious
for people to read it.


1641
01:23:37.048 --> 01:23:38.508
But are you gonna give
details of that night


1642
01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:40.510
in the hotel with --
Yes.


1643
01:23:40.635 --> 01:23:42.345
-You are.
-Yes.


1644
01:23:44.931 --> 01:23:48.518
Daniels: People just wanted
the salacious details.


1645
01:23:51.062 --> 01:23:53.022
When I came out of that bathroom
and Trump


1646
01:23:53.147 --> 01:23:54.941
was there in his underwear,

1647
01:23:55.066 --> 01:23:59.737
you know, so entitled,

1648
01:23:59.862 --> 01:24:05.952
I remember thinking, "Oh, fuck.
How did I get myself into this?


1649
01:24:06.077 --> 01:24:09.080
I felt that I had been misled
and tricked,


1650
01:24:09.205 --> 01:24:12.500
and I-I
can't even find the words,


1651
01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:15.837
but I thought we had
this mutual respect.


1652
01:24:18.339 --> 01:24:20.633
You know, I've maintained
it wasn't rape in any fashion.


1653
01:24:20.758 --> 01:24:22.969
Like, you know...

1654
01:24:23.094 --> 01:24:26.889
But I didn't say no
because I just --


1655
01:24:27.015 --> 01:24:29.142
I was 9 years old again.

1656
01:24:29.267 --> 01:24:33.146
**

1657
01:24:33.271 --> 01:24:34.689
And the last thing I remember
was like,


1658
01:24:34.814 --> 01:24:37.150
"I could totally take him
if I want to scream or fight,


1659
01:24:37.275 --> 01:24:39.193
but like, I'm not supposed
to act like that."


1660
01:24:39.319 --> 01:24:41.738
**

1661
01:24:41.863 --> 01:24:44.866
There's that whole dynamic,
because I was from the South,


1662
01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:48.286
that he was an elder and a man,

1663
01:24:48.411 --> 01:24:51.915
and I was taught to show respect

1664
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.667
and be a good girl.

1665
01:24:54.792 --> 01:24:57.712
**

1666
01:24:57.837 --> 01:25:01.883
People say, "You know,
you can't abuse a porn star."


1667
01:25:02.008 --> 01:25:03.551
That is not true.

1668
01:25:03.676 --> 01:25:07.055
What Trump said about
grabbing women by the pussy,


1669
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.514
he wasn't wrong.

1670
01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.350
Women will let you
grab them by the pussy


1671
01:25:10.475 --> 01:25:12.894
because they --
especially if you're famous,


1672
01:25:13.019 --> 01:25:14.604
whatever his direct quote was.

1673
01:25:14.729 --> 01:25:17.106
He shouldn't have said it,
he should never have done it,


1674
01:25:17.231 --> 01:25:19.150
but he's not wrong.

1675
01:25:19.275 --> 01:25:21.444
And I don't know
if they "Let you,"


1676
01:25:21.569 --> 01:25:26.032
but they don't tell you not to,
and that's what happened to me.


1677
01:25:26.157 --> 01:25:27.992
Trump obviously openly
admitted and bragged


1678
01:25:28.117 --> 01:25:29.786
about that sort of behavior.

1679
01:25:29.911 --> 01:25:32.372
And if somebody gets away with
something, they get more brazen,


1680
01:25:32.497 --> 01:25:35.291
they get more bold,
they get more aggressive.


1681
01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:39.254
To this day, I blame myself,
and I have not forgiven myself


1682
01:25:39.379 --> 01:25:43.716
because I didn't shut his ass
down in that moment


1683
01:25:43.841 --> 01:25:48.263
so maybe make him pause before
he tried it with someone else.


1684
01:25:48.388 --> 01:25:50.265
The hardest part
about all of this


1685
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.100
is I feel like
I am partially responsible


1686
01:25:52.225 --> 01:25:54.602
for every woman
that could have come after me.


1687
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.241
Daniels:
Good. How are you?


1688
01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:10.410
Uh-huh.

1689
01:26:10.535 --> 01:26:12.787
I'm sure it'll be
on Twitter any second.


1690
01:26:26.634 --> 01:26:29.012
Woman:
Federal judge has dismissed
Stormy Daniels lawsuit


1691
01:26:29.137 --> 01:26:30.471
against President Trump.

1692
01:26:30.597 --> 01:26:33.933
Man: The judge ruling
that Daniels is liable


1693
01:26:34.058 --> 01:26:37.395
for the President's
attorneys fees.


1694
01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.439
Woman: From the president,
a triumphant tweet


1695
01:26:39.564 --> 01:26:42.400
with a gratuitous insult.
"Great," he wrote,


1696
01:26:42.525 --> 01:26:46.362
"Now I can go after Horseface
and her third rate lawyer."


1697
01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:50.909
Daniels, deriding the president,
responded, "Game on, Tiny."


1698
01:26:51.034 --> 01:26:52.285
Nuzzi:
Losing the defamation case


1699
01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:55.788
has really destabilized
Stormy financially,


1700
01:26:55.914 --> 01:26:59.459
and Trump's supporters have
really seemed to relish in this


1701
01:26:59.584 --> 01:27:02.670
and to take great pleasure
in her defeat.


1702
01:27:04.756 --> 01:27:05.924
Okay.

1703
01:27:07.425 --> 01:27:08.801
Yes.

1704
01:27:08.927 --> 01:27:10.595
Daniels:
Remember how. the last booking,


1705
01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.931
it was completely
fucking packed


1706
01:27:13.056 --> 01:27:14.349
and all anybody wanted
was books?


1707
01:27:14.474 --> 01:27:15.391
Man: Yeah.

1708
01:27:15.516 --> 01:27:18.478
They're not selling
any more anywhere.


1709
01:27:19.604 --> 01:27:20.772
Uh, the same reason
that I've gotten


1710
01:27:20.897 --> 01:27:22.482
several e-mails
and messages


1711
01:27:22.607 --> 01:27:23.816
from people going, "We still
love you and support you,


1712
01:27:23.942 --> 01:27:26.694
but we can't justifiably
give you money anymore


1713
01:27:26.819 --> 01:27:28.404
because we know it's going
directly to Trump now


1714
01:27:28.529 --> 01:27:30.657
'cause you lost your case."

1715
01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:33.076
But I'm just so scared
all the time now


1716
01:27:33.201 --> 01:27:34.494
that I can't trust anyone.

1717
01:27:34.619 --> 01:27:36.663
I've gotten ripped off
by everybody.


1718
01:27:36.788 --> 01:27:38.915
You know, I think that when
people think you have money


1719
01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.503
that they're -- when they think
you're making millions,


1720
01:27:43.628 --> 01:27:46.047
they have less of a conscience
about stealing from you.


1721
01:27:52.637 --> 01:27:56.224
-Hello.
-Hey, Luke. It's Stormy.


1722
01:27:57.684 --> 01:28:01.604
Um, so I've been trying to get
my payment from Michael,


1723
01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:03.940
and Michael's been telling me
that it was in the mail,


1724
01:28:04.065 --> 01:28:06.734
that I should have it next
week, like, blah, blah, blah.


1725
01:28:06.859 --> 01:28:08.194
Well, finally, I just said,
"Fuck this,"


1726
01:28:08.319 --> 01:28:10.571
and called the publisher,

1727
01:28:10.697 --> 01:28:12.657
and they said that they already
made my third payment,


1728
01:28:12.782 --> 01:28:14.117
and all this time
I've been thinking


1729
01:28:14.242 --> 01:28:17.662
they were
four months late.


1730
01:28:21.499 --> 01:28:23.543
Two.

1731
01:28:23.668 --> 01:28:27.380
I got paid --
I'm 100% positive.


1732
01:28:27.505 --> 01:28:29.549
Those are the only
two payments I've gotten,


1733
01:28:29.674 --> 01:28:31.384
and I have text messages
back and forth with me


1734
01:28:31.509 --> 01:28:33.344
and Michael
from every single day


1735
01:28:33.469 --> 01:28:34.762
for the last three months,
going,


1736
01:28:34.887 --> 01:28:36.639
"When are they going
to make my third payment?


1737
01:28:36.764 --> 01:28:39.559
When are they going to make
their third payment?"


1738
01:28:49.652 --> 01:28:51.779
From who?
That's not a real thing.


1739
01:28:51.904 --> 01:28:53.698
I never did that.

1740
01:28:55.033 --> 01:28:57.243
I didn't sign anything,
Luke, I swear to you.


1741
01:28:57.368 --> 01:29:00.371
I have no idea
what you are talking about.


1742
01:29:04.918 --> 01:29:07.754
I am 99% sure that Michael
forged my signature,


1743
01:29:07.879 --> 01:29:09.380
because this is the first time
I've heard


1744
01:29:09.505 --> 01:29:12.800
"custodial account" ever.
Ever.


1745
01:29:19.307 --> 01:29:22.727
I don't know, Luke.
It's life-changing money to me.


1746
01:29:24.562 --> 01:29:26.356
All right. When you get
that fourth payment,


1747
01:29:26.481 --> 01:29:28.066
for the love of God,

1748
01:29:28.191 --> 01:29:30.234
don't give it to anybody but me.

1749
01:29:36.407 --> 01:29:37.951
You know what?
They're gonna give me


1750
01:29:38.076 --> 01:29:39.619
my fourth payment on Tuesday,
and Michael was gonna pass


1751
01:29:39.744 --> 01:29:41.704
the fourth payment off
as the fucking third,


1752
01:29:41.829 --> 01:29:45.541
and then say that they never
gave me the fourth payment.


1753
01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:48.711
-Fucking is now.
-Busted, motherfucker.


1754
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:53.800
Well, Tulsa attorney
Clark Brewster tells me


1755
01:29:53.925 --> 01:29:55.343
he is now the new attorney
for adult-film


1756
01:29:55.468 --> 01:29:58.471
actress Stormy Daniels.
A federal judge...


1757
01:29:58.596 --> 01:30:00.890
Brewster:
Mr. Avenatti, Clark Brewster.


1758
01:30:01.015 --> 01:30:03.268
Avenatti: Ah, Mr. Brewster,
pleasure to meet you by phone.


1759
01:30:03.393 --> 01:30:04.936
Yes.
Hey, just on an abundance


1760
01:30:05.061 --> 01:30:06.854
of caution, because we're
probably gonna cover


1761
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.732
a number of topics,
I do have my recorder on.


1762
01:30:09.857 --> 01:30:11.609
Do you have any problem
with that?


1763
01:30:11.734 --> 01:30:14.445
Yeah, I do. I mean,
I'm not crazy about having my --


1764
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:16.030
I'll send you --
I'll send it to you.


1765
01:30:16.155 --> 01:30:17.699
Especially with counsel.
Yeah.


1766
01:30:17.824 --> 01:30:21.452
I simply know this --
that wires were sent to her


1767
01:30:21.578 --> 01:30:22.996
on the first payment only.

1768
01:30:23.121 --> 01:30:24.956
And then they got interrupted
by your office


1769
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:27.750
and were sent to you,
and that is very concerning.


1770
01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:29.752
Sounds like I'm being
accused of something


1771
01:30:29.877 --> 01:30:32.922
that, frankly,
we didn't do anything wrong.


1772
01:30:33.047 --> 01:30:36.634
Brewster:
He resisted, he pushed back,
he became threatening,


1773
01:30:36.759 --> 01:30:39.762
and I just lost
all kind of effort


1774
01:30:39.887 --> 01:30:42.557
to try to talk with the guy
in a reasonable way.


1775
01:30:42.682 --> 01:30:45.226
What I see is a lawyer
that has lied to his client


1776
01:30:45.351 --> 01:30:46.561
and has embezzled
some money


1777
01:30:46.686 --> 01:30:48.271
and converted the money.
That's outrageous.


1778
01:30:48.396 --> 01:30:49.689
Okay. Well, that's
what the record shows.


1779
01:30:49.814 --> 01:30:51.482
Well,
that's not what...


1780
01:30:51.608 --> 01:30:54.569
I had no idea about the depth
and background of other cases


1781
01:30:54.694 --> 01:30:56.029
that he might be involved in.

1782
01:30:56.154 --> 01:30:59.616
Today, we announce criminal
extortion charges


1783
01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:02.035
against Michael Avenatti.

1784
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.579
The charges are based
on Avenatti's scheme


1785
01:31:04.704 --> 01:31:06.831
to extract more
than $20 million


1786
01:31:06.956 --> 01:31:09.292
in payments
from a public company.


1787
01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:10.710
Explain myself?

1788
01:31:10.835 --> 01:31:11.753
Man: What's going on
with the Nike case?


1789
01:31:11.878 --> 01:31:13.212
Looking forward
to that trial.


1790
01:31:13.338 --> 01:31:15.006
-Yeah.
-Yeah, they say that the trial


1791
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:17.717
is a search for the truth,
and we're gonna find it.


1792
01:31:17.842 --> 01:31:19.636
Turned out that he had
a much deeper,


1793
01:31:19.761 --> 01:31:21.012
bigger problem in California

1794
01:31:21.137 --> 01:31:24.057
that I didn't have knowledge
of at the time.


1795
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.811
He just got way in, I think,
over his head, financially,


1796
01:31:28.937 --> 01:31:31.481
and did some things that were
damaging to a lot of clients,


1797
01:31:31.606 --> 01:31:33.107
including Stormy.

1798
01:31:33.232 --> 01:31:35.318
Holt: One of the President's
most vocal critics


1799
01:31:35.443 --> 01:31:36.945
faces new troubles tonight.

1800
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:40.156
Federal prosecutors charged
attorney Michael Avenatti


1801
01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:44.118
with stealing nearly $300,000
from his former client,


1802
01:31:44.244 --> 01:31:45.662
Stormy Daniels,

1803
01:31:45.787 --> 01:31:48.623
by forging her name
to fund a lavish lifestyle,


1804
01:31:48.748 --> 01:31:52.252
including travel, dry-cleaning,
and a payment on his Ferrari.


1805
01:31:52.377 --> 01:31:56.464
Daniels: Michael Avenatti --
he betrayed me in every way.


1806
01:31:56.589 --> 01:31:59.384
And when it comes to somebody
that you trusted


1807
01:31:59.509 --> 01:32:00.760
and you thought
was your friend,


1808
01:32:00.885 --> 01:32:03.972
it's really heartbreaking
and upsetting,


1809
01:32:04.097 --> 01:32:07.892
which became this pattern
with the people closest to me.


1810
01:32:10.061 --> 01:32:11.437
Man: Stormy Daniels
coming to Calgary,


1811
01:32:11.562 --> 01:32:13.648
Sunday, November 3rd,
at 7:00 p.m.


1812
01:32:13.773 --> 01:32:15.692
She'll be performing at the...

1813
01:32:18.319 --> 01:32:19.862
We booked another tour,

1814
01:32:19.988 --> 01:32:22.657
and it was a combination
of dancing and comedy clubs.


1815
01:32:22.782 --> 01:32:26.869
Crawford: We left L.A.,
flying to Calgary


1816
01:32:26.995 --> 01:32:29.581
and the Border Patrol agent
for Canada,


1817
01:32:29.706 --> 01:32:31.374
he pulls Stormy off to the side

1818
01:32:31.499 --> 01:32:33.668
and he's looking at her I.D.,
he's looking at her passport.


1819
01:32:36.838 --> 01:32:41.134
And he tells her that she has
all of these charges.


1820
01:32:41.259 --> 01:32:45.263
Just this crazy shit
that is in no way true.


1821
01:32:45.388 --> 01:32:47.015
Man:

1822
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:52.520
It was 17 charges,
not even a believable amount.


1823
01:33:03.364 --> 01:33:06.910
Daniels: You're not nearly
as fucking confused as I am.


1824
01:33:07.035 --> 01:33:10.038
You said this is in the
United States FBI system?


1825
01:33:11.331 --> 01:33:13.041
Because I wasn't there
for any of this stuff.


1826
01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:15.501
The Border Patrol agent
realized


1827
01:33:15.627 --> 01:33:16.961
something had to be off.

1828
01:33:17.086 --> 01:33:20.632
He said, "There's no way
you did all of this."


1829
01:33:20.757 --> 01:33:22.717
Daniels:
Dwayne, call Clark.


1830
01:33:22.842 --> 01:33:25.803
I was advised by both
the Border Patrol


1831
01:33:25.929 --> 01:33:30.141
and by my attorneys to lay low.

1832
01:33:30.266 --> 01:33:34.646
All it took was the wrong person
to pull me over or scan my I.D.


1833
01:33:34.771 --> 01:33:36.606
and make a phone call.

1834
01:33:45.907 --> 01:33:47.033
They were on my FBI record,

1835
01:33:47.158 --> 01:33:49.077
but the FBI
did not put them there.


1836
01:33:50.536 --> 01:33:53.331
They know who did it.
Like, the FBI's not gonna come


1837
01:33:53.456 --> 01:33:57.794
to a porn star and tell me
how they got breached.


1838
01:33:57.919 --> 01:33:59.254
I couldn't obviously
go to Canada,


1839
01:33:59.379 --> 01:34:01.965
I couldn't go anywhere,
which made it impossible


1840
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:05.051
for me to work,
and I had no way to make money.


1841
01:34:05.176 --> 01:34:07.887
Every time I stood up,
I got kicked down even harder.


1842
01:34:08.012 --> 01:34:09.555
And I didn't believe
in those moments


1843
01:34:09.681 --> 01:34:11.516
that it would ever
be normal again.


1844
01:34:11.641 --> 01:34:14.018
And I hit rock bottom.

1845
01:34:24.445 --> 01:34:27.532
Man: Trump's presidency ends
today after four contentious


1846
01:34:27.657 --> 01:34:29.659
and, at times,
tumultuous years.


1847
01:34:38.084 --> 01:34:39.544
Man:
The 45th president leaves


1848
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:40.962
behind a nation
severely wounded,


1849
01:34:41.087 --> 01:34:43.590
scarred by an insurrection
at the U.S. Capitol


1850
01:34:43.715 --> 01:34:45.258
and crippled by the doubts
he sowed


1851
01:34:45.383 --> 01:34:49.304
over the nation's
fair electoral process.


1852
01:34:50.805 --> 01:34:51.806
Daniels:

1853
01:34:51.931 --> 01:34:54.684
I think I did what I wanted to.

1854
01:34:54.809 --> 01:34:56.227
Did I get it?

1855
01:34:56.352 --> 01:34:58.313
Right in the crotch.

1856
01:35:00.398 --> 01:35:02.358
I have some anger issues.

1857
01:35:02.483 --> 01:35:04.819
Man: Attorney Michael Avenatti
has been convicted


1858
01:35:04.944 --> 01:35:06.529
for stealing
from his former client,


1859
01:35:06.654 --> 01:35:08.156
the adult-film star
Stormy Daniels.


1860
01:35:08.281 --> 01:35:09.991
Woman: Michael Avenatti
said the whole time he was


1861
01:35:10.116 --> 01:35:13.244
100% innocent, but the jury
thought differently.


1862
01:35:13.369 --> 01:35:15.288
Daniels: Michael Avenatti is
on a bus right now,


1863
01:35:15.413 --> 01:35:19.250
being shipped across the country
for sentencing in my case


1864
01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:23.212
and I guess wrote me
an apology letter today.


1865
01:35:23.338 --> 01:35:27.842
Does this sound
one bit remorseful to you?


1866
01:35:27.967 --> 01:35:31.179
"Dear Stormy,
I write to apologize to you


1867
01:35:31.304 --> 01:35:34.182
for my actions and conduct
over the last three years


1868
01:35:34.307 --> 01:35:36.684
and especially over
the last several months,


1869
01:35:36.809 --> 01:35:38.436
I have had a significant
amount of time


1870
01:35:38.561 --> 01:35:39.854
to reflect on my life..."

1871
01:35:39.979 --> 01:35:42.315
'Cause you in prison, bitch.

1872
01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.193
"...our friendship, and my
legal representation of you.


1873
01:35:45.318 --> 01:35:48.112
It is obvious that I failed you
in many respects,


1874
01:35:48.237 --> 01:35:51.241
and that I disappointed you and
let you down in multiple ways.


1875
01:35:51.366 --> 01:35:54.744
I tried my best to serve you
in many ways as a friend,


1876
01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:56.663
confidant, and adviser.

1877
01:35:56.788 --> 01:35:59.624
I made myself available
to you 24/7


1878
01:35:59.749 --> 01:36:01.251
and in my support for you.

1879
01:36:01.376 --> 01:36:03.711
But along the way,
I know that I failed.


1880
01:36:03.836 --> 01:36:05.213
I wish that we could
turn back the clock..."


1881
01:36:07.006 --> 01:36:08.925
"So that I'd be better
at stealing from you"?


1882
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:11.219
"...turn back the clock
so that the mistakes I made


1883
01:36:11.344 --> 01:36:14.764
would never be repeated.
I am truly sorry, Michael."


1884
01:36:14.889 --> 01:36:16.975
That's pretty epic.

1885
01:36:34.909 --> 01:36:37.245
Blade: Let's go get it!

1886
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:39.831
All right.

1887
01:36:39.956 --> 01:36:42.166
Be prepared.
He is ugly.


1888
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.879
We love ugly, beautiful horses.

1889
01:36:47.005 --> 01:36:48.423
Daniels: Watch that gate.
Watch it.


1890
01:36:48.548 --> 01:36:50.341
Daniels: Now, the Trump wasn't
in office anymore


1891
01:36:50.466 --> 01:36:51.968
and he had his own
set of issues,


1892
01:36:52.093 --> 01:36:54.679
so it wasn't all
"The Stormy Daniels Show,"


1893
01:36:54.804 --> 01:36:56.306
I had just sort of began
to return


1894
01:36:56.431 --> 01:36:59.058
to a little bit
of normalcy in my life.


1895
01:36:59.183 --> 01:37:01.269
Glen and I started
to get on better terms.


1896
01:37:01.394 --> 01:37:03.980
We came to an understanding,
and our daughter


1897
01:37:04.105 --> 01:37:07.317
was never taken from me.

1898
01:37:07.442 --> 01:37:11.070
Glen: To her credit, I think
whatever version of a family


1899
01:37:11.195 --> 01:37:14.574
we have right now,
I applaud her for it.


1900
01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:15.909
There was a lot of --

1901
01:37:16.034 --> 01:37:18.328
a lot of damage
left in the in the wake,


1902
01:37:18.453 --> 01:37:19.913
and a lot of people
don't realize that,


1903
01:37:20.038 --> 01:37:21.164
and they don't realize
it's people's lives


1904
01:37:21.289 --> 01:37:23.041
that are being affected.

1905
01:37:23.166 --> 01:37:25.251
It's not a perfect situation,

1906
01:37:25.376 --> 01:37:27.712
but we're trying to make
the best of it.


1907
01:37:27.837 --> 01:37:29.839
Are you watching this?
Look at this ridiculousness.


1908
01:37:29.964 --> 01:37:31.299
Mister --

1909
01:37:34.135 --> 01:37:35.720
* Let's go, boys *

1910
01:37:35.845 --> 01:37:37.722
* Let's go get us
some carrots *


1911
01:37:37.847 --> 01:37:39.557
Daniels:
I got married to Barrett,


1912
01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:42.185
who was a good friend of mine.

1913
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:45.146
We had worked together
quite a few times,


1914
01:37:45.271 --> 01:37:48.691
but we never dated,
never even kissed off screen.


1915
01:37:48.816 --> 01:37:53.071
And so we rekindled all of that
and moved and got horses,


1916
01:37:53.196 --> 01:37:55.323
and everything was going great.

1917
01:37:57.450 --> 01:38:00.745
And then, last March,
I was actually out here riding


1918
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.121
and my phone
was ding ding ding!


1919
01:38:02.247 --> 01:38:04.582
I was like,
"Who is blowing up my phone?"


1920
01:38:04.707 --> 01:38:07.669
And I picked it up,
and I was like, "Oh, my God."


1921
01:38:07.794 --> 01:38:10.380
It was like -- it was like 2018
all over again.


1922
01:38:10.505 --> 01:38:12.173
Muir: We're coming
in the air a bit earlier


1923
01:38:12.298 --> 01:38:14.092
than usual because of
breaking news at this hour.


1924
01:38:14.217 --> 01:38:16.511
A grand jury here in
New York City has just


1925
01:38:16.636 --> 01:38:20.306
handed up an indictment against
former president Donald Trump,


1926
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:22.183
making him the first
former president


1927
01:38:22.308 --> 01:38:25.186
in U.S. history
to face criminal charges.


1928
01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:27.981
The D.A. has evidence that Trump
was plotting to hide


1929
01:38:28.106 --> 01:38:30.149
two sets of stories
from two women,


1930
01:38:30.275 --> 01:38:31.776
which could have
impacted voters.


1931
01:38:31.901 --> 01:38:33.486
This is the catch-and-kill plot.

1932
01:38:33.611 --> 01:38:37.490
These four horrible radical-left
Democrat investigations


1933
01:38:37.615 --> 01:38:41.536
of your all-time
favorite president, me,


1934
01:38:41.661 --> 01:38:45.957
is just a continuation of
the most disgusting witch hunt


1935
01:38:46.082 --> 01:38:48.543
in the history of our country.

1936
01:38:48.668 --> 01:38:52.505
Stormy "Horseface" Daniels'
extortion plot,


1937
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:53.923
it's fake news.

1938
01:38:54.048 --> 01:38:55.758
Our enemies are desperate
to stop us


1939
01:38:55.883 --> 01:39:00.471
because they know that we are
the only ones who can stop them,


1940
01:39:00.597 --> 01:39:03.349
and they know it very strongly.

1941
01:39:06.644 --> 01:39:10.106
Daniels:
When the indictment happened,
Michael Cohen actually texted me


1942
01:39:10.231 --> 01:39:13.901
and expressed extreme fear
for my safety.


1943
01:39:22.535 --> 01:39:26.873
Somehow, our address
was leaked again online,


1944
01:39:26.998 --> 01:39:29.834
and in an attempt
to draw my horse out


1945
01:39:29.959 --> 01:39:32.045
so that I would then go out,

1946
01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:35.590
they shot him
with the rubber bullet.


1947
01:39:37.467 --> 01:39:39.344
The justice system failed me.

1948
01:39:39.469 --> 01:39:43.473
It has absolutely failed me
in every single way.


1949
01:39:43.598 --> 01:39:47.852
It didn't protect me when I made
reports about being threatened


1950
01:39:47.977 --> 01:39:50.563
or somebody attacking my horse.

1951
01:39:50.688 --> 01:39:53.566
And that's been one of
the hardest things about this.


1952
01:39:53.691 --> 01:40:03.576
**

1953
01:40:03.701 --> 01:40:05.078
**

1954
01:40:05.203 --> 01:40:06.496
Man:
Now, there are very few


1955
01:40:06.621 --> 01:40:08.164
confirmed details
about Trump's indictment.


1956
01:40:08.289 --> 01:40:09.749
According to
the Associated Press,


1957
01:40:09.874 --> 01:40:11.292
Trump's attorney has been
told the indictment


1958
01:40:11.417 --> 01:40:13.503
relates to hush-money payments
made during


1959
01:40:13.628 --> 01:40:17.924
the 2016 presidential election
to porn actress Stormy Daniels.


1960
01:40:18.049 --> 01:40:20.802
DeSantis says Florida
will not assist


1961
01:40:20.927 --> 01:40:22.595
in an extradition request.

1962
01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.973
Ugh.
Let's pack.


1963
01:40:33.106 --> 01:40:34.857
Nobody cares about her agenda,

1964
01:40:34.983 --> 01:40:37.652
and that's the hardest part.

1965
01:40:37.777 --> 01:40:40.613
No disrespect, but this
documentary is an agenda


1966
01:40:40.738 --> 01:40:43.491
to help somebody
do something to make money.


1967
01:40:43.616 --> 01:40:46.411
At this point, she should do it
for the fucking money.


1968
01:40:46.536 --> 01:40:48.121
She deserves to be compensated

1969
01:40:48.246 --> 01:40:49.664
so she can go hide
on an island somewhere


1970
01:40:49.789 --> 01:40:52.458
and stay away from everybody
and live her life


1971
01:40:52.584 --> 01:40:55.545
without everybody
fuckin' fucking it up.


1972
01:41:02.552 --> 01:41:04.512
Morgan: Do you believe
if this goes to trial


1973
01:41:04.637 --> 01:41:06.806
that you will be
completely vindicated


1974
01:41:06.931 --> 01:41:08.933
and that it will be established
you've told the truth


1975
01:41:09.058 --> 01:41:10.685
and he's lied?

1976
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:11.894
Um...

1977
01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.771
That's wishful thinking.

1978
01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:16.232
It makes you
become paranoid.


1979
01:41:16.357 --> 01:41:17.859
But do you wish
you'd never met him?


1980
01:41:17.984 --> 01:41:20.361
Of course.

1981
01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.536
"You should be super proud."

1982
01:41:30.246 --> 01:41:32.665
"Here's our straight
-A student."

1983
01:41:34.834 --> 01:41:38.880
I said, "I'm so proud.
Did she like her gift?"


1984
01:41:39.005 --> 01:41:42.425
And her dad said, "Yep. So cool.
Thanks for doing that.


1985
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:45.511
She's so stoked.
Wish you could be here.


1986
01:41:45.637 --> 01:41:50.475
Our baby got straight A's
and is at the top of her class."


1987
01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.185
So yesterday was her last day
of school because --


1988
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:54.979
Time change, obviously.

1989
01:41:55.104 --> 01:41:57.649
She got straight A's.

1990
01:41:57.774 --> 01:42:00.860
And instead of being there
with her,


1991
01:42:00.985 --> 01:42:05.490
I'm here talking about
an ex-president's penis.


1992
01:42:05.615 --> 01:42:09.619
**

1993
01:42:09.744 --> 01:42:13.873
As you sat down this morning,
you said to us, "It's pointless.


1994
01:42:13.998 --> 01:42:16.626
It's winless.
I now regret speaking out."


1995
01:42:16.751 --> 01:42:18.169
Why?

1996
01:42:18.294 --> 01:42:19.545
Because of that.
It just --


1997
01:42:19.671 --> 01:42:22.298
Nobody cares what
the truth is anymore.


1998
01:42:22.423 --> 01:42:23.883
Are you frightened?

1999
01:42:24.008 --> 01:42:25.927
Yes.

2000
01:42:26.052 --> 01:42:27.595
Yeah, I think
we all should be.


2001
01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.598
**

2002
01:42:30.723 --> 01:42:32.308
Daniels: "Just watched
'Good Morning Britain'


2003
01:42:32.433 --> 01:42:36.562
and you're a brave
and strong woman. Keep going."


2004
01:42:36.688 --> 01:42:38.356
"Trying to set an example
for your daughter?


2005
01:42:38.481 --> 01:42:41.150
Yeah, right.
Try closing your legs first."


2006
01:42:41.276 --> 01:42:42.568
"You're tired and bloated.

2007
01:42:42.694 --> 01:42:44.529
How many drinks
did you have this morning?"


2008
01:42:44.654 --> 01:42:46.656
"Just a modern-day whore saint."

2009
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:47.865
"You are pure scum."

2010
01:42:47.991 --> 01:42:49.659
"Even if you'd have been raped,

2011
01:42:49.784 --> 01:42:51.411
you should have kept your mouth
quiet for the greater good."


2012
01:42:51.536 --> 01:42:52.662
"You're nothing
but a fat hillbilly.


2013
01:42:52.787 --> 01:42:55.665
Trump would never touch you.
Stop lying


2014
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:58.501
before I'm forced
to shut you up myself."


2015
01:42:58.626 --> 01:42:59.711
Direct threat.

2016
01:42:59.836 --> 01:43:02.130
"Kill yourself."

2017
01:43:03.339 --> 01:43:05.425
"Stormy Daniels'
expression of demoralization


2018
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:08.845
provides us
with a glimpse of our future."


2019
01:43:08.970 --> 01:43:10.054
"Take a good look."

2020
01:43:10.179 --> 01:43:11.764
You don't need to read
any more.


2021
01:43:11.889 --> 01:43:13.516
There's much more.

2022
01:43:13.641 --> 01:43:15.560
"You just signed
your death warrant."


2023
01:43:15.685 --> 01:43:17.395
I don't know what that means.

2024
01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.857
I thought I did that
a long time ago.


2025
01:43:20.982 --> 01:43:28.281
Back in 2018, there was stuff
like, "Liar, slut, gold digger."


2026
01:43:28.406 --> 01:43:30.700
This time around,
it is very different.


2027
01:43:30.825 --> 01:43:32.785
It is direct threats.

2028
01:43:32.911 --> 01:43:35.622
It is, "I'm gonna come to your
house and slit your throat.


2029
01:43:35.747 --> 01:43:37.707
Your daughter
should be euthanized."


2030
01:43:37.832 --> 01:43:39.751
They're not even using
bot accounts.


2031
01:43:39.876 --> 01:43:43.421
They're using
their real accounts.


2032
01:43:43.546 --> 01:43:45.882
I compare them
to suicide bombers.


2033
01:43:46.007 --> 01:43:49.928
They legitimately think that
what they're doing is right.


2034
01:43:52.597 --> 01:43:55.433
Those people who see me
as a villain,


2035
01:43:55.558 --> 01:43:58.436
it just makes me scratch my head
and really question


2036
01:43:58.561 --> 01:44:01.606
how they would want
their daughters treated


2037
01:44:01.731 --> 01:44:04.359
or their sisters
or their mother.


2038
01:44:10.531 --> 01:44:13.743
Just a never-ending

2039
01:44:13.868 --> 01:44:18.164
avalanche of court documents
and lawsuits


2040
01:44:18.289 --> 01:44:20.792
and court transcripts.

2041
01:44:22.377 --> 01:44:24.504
I want it to die.

2042
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:26.756
If I had all
of these legal bills piled up,


2043
01:44:26.881 --> 01:44:29.008
I would have never been able
to pay them.


2044
01:44:29.133 --> 01:44:33.012
And Clark is the only one
who never charged me


2045
01:44:33.137 --> 01:44:34.681
and kept fighting for me.

2046
01:44:34.806 --> 01:44:38.685
I can't even imagine
where I would be.


2047
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:40.853
She's really in
the eye of the storm.


2048
01:44:40.979 --> 01:44:43.982
The irony is, Trump's
going after her for fees


2049
01:44:44.107 --> 01:44:46.109
he probably has never paid.

2050
01:44:46.234 --> 01:44:50.738
I think it's more about him
trying to intimidate a witness


2051
01:44:50.863 --> 01:44:54.659
that may appear
in a case against him.


2052
01:44:54.784 --> 01:44:57.245
King: When the Trump story
first started, I thought,


2053
01:44:57.370 --> 01:45:00.707
"Oh, but Stormy's gonna be fine.
She'll always be fine."


2054
01:45:00.832 --> 01:45:05.295
And I don't think
I really got worried


2055
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:07.922
until more recently

2056
01:45:08.047 --> 01:45:10.091
with the lawsuits.

2057
01:45:10.216 --> 01:45:13.678
It's like they're just trying
to bleed her dry.


2058
01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:25.148
It's very telling
that someone like Stormy Daniels


2059
01:45:25.273 --> 01:45:31.195
can get this mistreated this
many times by this many lawyers,


2060
01:45:31.321 --> 01:45:35.742
all of whom are men, and she's
still left holding the bag.


2061
01:45:35.867 --> 01:45:37.911
But I think it tells you
something both about


2062
01:45:38.036 --> 01:45:41.706
the real decay
and race to the bottom


2063
01:45:41.831 --> 01:45:45.293
that often surrounds
Donald Trump and the larger,


2064
01:45:45.418 --> 01:45:52.759
if I may, structural misogyny
in the legal system


2065
01:45:52.884 --> 01:45:55.094
when you look
at the whole thing together.


2066
01:45:55.219 --> 01:45:58.181
**

2067
01:45:58.306 --> 01:46:00.516
It's a lot.

2068
01:46:01.976 --> 01:46:05.813
Yeah, and it's a fire hazard
in my house and my brain.


2069
01:46:07.982 --> 01:46:10.443
The way that this has changed
over time is, it started off


2070
01:46:10.568 --> 01:46:13.363
as, "You got
to be fucking kidding me.


2071
01:46:13.488 --> 01:46:15.031
This is ridiculous,"

2072
01:46:15.156 --> 01:46:16.658
to "This is terrifying,"

2073
01:46:16.783 --> 01:46:18.826
to, "This is infuriating,"

2074
01:46:18.952 --> 01:46:21.746
to now it's just like,
"This is just pointless."


2075
01:46:21.871 --> 01:46:24.958
I have no hope at all anymore.

2076
01:46:26.542 --> 01:46:30.588
Kimmel: She told the truth,
and she paid a price for that.


2077
01:46:30.713 --> 01:46:31.965
It's probably the first thing

2078
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:34.801
everyone who meets her
asks her about.


2079
01:46:34.926 --> 01:46:36.594
Her daughter
has to deal with it.


2080
01:46:36.719 --> 01:46:38.888
This is not something
that just goes away.


2081
01:46:39.013 --> 01:46:40.431
Rogen: She didn't realize
she would one day


2082
01:46:40.556 --> 01:46:41.933
be at the center
of this giant thing,


2083
01:46:42.058 --> 01:46:46.396
as she was messing around
with some game-show host.


2084
01:46:46.521 --> 01:46:48.231
She's someone who, like,

2085
01:46:48.356 --> 01:46:51.484
made an enemy of the most
powerful guy on the planet


2086
01:46:51.609 --> 01:46:53.486
and didn't, like, cower and --

2087
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:55.071
And, you know, that was
something that --


2088
01:46:55.196 --> 01:46:57.991
that's something that takes
a lot of strength, you know?


2089
01:46:58.116 --> 01:47:01.786
Nuzzi: She didn't want to be
in a years-long legal battle


2090
01:47:01.911 --> 01:47:04.038
with the now former president.

2091
01:47:04.163 --> 01:47:05.957
The fact that she said
that she doesn't want him to go


2092
01:47:06.082 --> 01:47:09.419
to prison
over their legal drama,


2093
01:47:09.544 --> 01:47:11.004
but she would go to prison

2094
01:47:11.129 --> 01:47:14.090
so that she doesn't have
to pay him a dime,


2095
01:47:14.215 --> 01:47:17.093
that's Stormy Daniels.

2096
01:47:17.218 --> 01:47:21.014
I think that Stormy Daniels
and the phrase "hush money"


2097
01:47:21.139 --> 01:47:23.725
is forever going to be
associated with the idea


2098
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:27.186
of legal accountability
coming home to Donald Trump.


2099
01:47:27.312 --> 01:47:31.649
I want her to be speaking as
much or as little as she wants.


2100
01:47:31.774 --> 01:47:36.321
I mean, that's freedom, right?

2101
01:47:36.446 --> 01:47:38.865
Daniels:
I feel like, you know,


2102
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:42.410
the way that this is
different from 2018


2103
01:47:42.535 --> 01:47:44.829
is that I have
more knowledge.


2104
01:47:44.954 --> 01:47:47.498
Um, the shock of
it's not the same.


2105
01:47:47.624 --> 01:47:50.919
I'm desensitized
to some of it,


2106
01:47:51.044 --> 01:47:54.631
but they've also become
more violent with me.


2107
01:47:54.756 --> 01:47:58.635
I'm more prepared
with my legal knowledge,


2108
01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.595
but I'm also tired.

2109
01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.265
Like, my soul is so tired.

2110
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:07.060
So, I mean...

2111
01:48:07.185 --> 01:48:10.521
And I don't know
if I'm so much a warrior now


2112
01:48:10.647 --> 01:48:13.691
as -- -- as, um...

2113
01:48:13.816 --> 01:48:16.277
out of fucks, man.
I'm out of fucks.


2114
01:48:18.071 --> 01:48:20.323
And I won't give up because
I'm telling the truth,


2115
01:48:20.448 --> 01:48:24.911
and I kind of don't even know
if it matters anymore.


2116
01:48:27.205 --> 01:48:28.164
Gibson: Thank you.

2117
01:48:28.289 --> 01:48:30.208
Thank you.

2118
