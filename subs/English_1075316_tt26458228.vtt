1
00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:23.941
Yeah, it's so quiet out here,
I feel like I'm all alone.


2
00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:26.988
Mm.

3
00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:30.339
No, Mom, that's a good thing.

4
00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:32.428
Yeah, after all that nonsense
with Jeff,


5
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:37.041
I just really needed
to get away and unplug.


6
00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:38.303
No, I don't know.

7
00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:44.484
No, I don't really want
to get into it if I'm honest.


8
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.095
It's a divorce.

9
00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:50.533
He's a jerk,
it's gonna be messy.


10
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.493
Yeah, I just really want
to relax.


11
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.192
Okay.

12
00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:58.367
Mm.

13
00:00:58.498 --> 00:00:59.629
Hey, Mom?

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.936
Mom, I'm gonna go ahead and go.

15
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.722
Yeah, I'll talk to you
in a few days when I get back.


16
00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.682
Yeah, I know.

17
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.553
I love you, too, mm-hm.

18
00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:16.559
Okay. Bye.

19
00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:11.179
♪ I'm the type who expects you
to surface ♪


20
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.364
♪ 'Cause then I'll wait for you
to come through ♪


21
00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.461
Howdy, partner!

22
00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:36.857
- Are you going country on me?
- Hardly.


23
00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:39.816
I'm just packing up
a few of Craig's things.


24
00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:41.949
And trying them all on
as you do it?


25
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.299
You don't think
I can pull it off?


26
00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.429
Danielle.

27
00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:46.823
Yeesh.

28
00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:53.787
So, what are you gonna do
with all this junk?


29
00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:55.963
Gonna leave it in the garage
until he picks it up.


30
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.355
You should throw it away.

31
00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:59.096
Some of it is good stuff.

32
00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:01.055
Then you donate it to Goodwill.

33
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.796
You don't give it back to him.

34
00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.276
It's his, though.

35
00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.891
Are you all right?

36
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.283
I'm fine.

37
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.981
Why?

38
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.548
Well, because Craig
cheated on you


39
00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.203
and lied to you about it

40
00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:23.991
and then got caught red-handed
here in your home.


41
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.428
And now you're packing up
all of his things


42
00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:27.908
all nice and neatly for him?

43
00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.171
What else am I supposed to do?

44
00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:34.523
I can't have all of him
in my house.


45
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.394
Besides, he's still
on the mortgage


46
00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:38.197
and I don't want to give him
any ammunition


47
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:39.659
to use against me.

48
00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.184
He'll get what's coming to him.

49
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.707
I know it.

50
00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:49.494
There she is, there's my spicy
best friend I know and love!


51
00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:53.063
Ugh.

52
00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.024
For the record,

53
00:03:57.111 --> 00:04:00.592
while I'm not happy
how things unfolded,


54
00:04:00.723 --> 00:04:02.856
I am glad that they did.

55
00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:04.596
I mean, he wasn't good enough
for you.


56
00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:07.208
Alesha...

57
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:08.818
Sorry. Too soon.

58
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.168
Thank you.

59
00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:20.221
There's just
so many memories here.


60
00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:24.007
Maybe you should get away.

61
00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:26.923
- And go where?
- Anywhere!


62
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.272
Go see your mom.

63
00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:32.146
Or better yet,
where's your computer?


64
00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:33.276
Why?

65
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.109
Vacation.

66
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.068
You, me, Hannah.

67
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:42.480
I can't take a vacation
right now.


68
00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:44.375
- I have work.
- Mm-hm.


69
00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:47.596
Next week is really important
and sweeps are coming up.


70
00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:51.252
- Found it!
- Found what?


71
00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:56.736
It's only 20 miles away
and it is right at the beach.


72
00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:58.433
You're not gonna let up
on this, are you?


73
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.043
Nope.

74
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.220
You do the honors.

75
00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.007
Okay.

76
00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:08.617
Ahh! Ha-ha!

77
00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:09.705
Party central!

78
00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.402
Here we come!

79
00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.057
Oh, this is gonna be a blast.

80
00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:41.432
Wow.

81
00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:58.623
- Ooh.
- Wow.


82
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.670
Wow, you were right.

83
00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:03.324
Skipping Derek's
niece's birthday for.


84
00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:04.716
Yeah, and, I mean, she's two.

85
00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:06.849
She's not gonna remember.

86
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.809
And besides, she needs us more
right now.


87
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.467
Okay, ladies, so, to recap.
The primary bedroom


88
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.514
which is right down the hall
over there.


89
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:20.926
- Thank you.
- And, then, there's two


90
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.647
other bedrooms
for me and Hannah.


91
00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:24.954
You can pick.
I'm fine with whatever.


92
00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.391
Okay, well, then,
I'll pick the one back here


93
00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:29.916
because it's bigger.

94
00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:31.569
- See you guys later!
- Yes.


95
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.484
Shall we?

96
00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:35.051
Woo-hoo!

97
00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:37.271
Party time!

98
00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:06.169
Not today, Craig.

99
00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:19.008
Woo! Woo-hoo!

100
00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.272
Oh, it is never too early
for champagne.


101
00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.796
- It's champagne.
- Yes, yes, yes.


102
00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:26.470
Bubbly, bubbly.
Who doesn't love bubbly?


103
00:07:26.494 --> 00:07:28.147
- Thank you.
- Yes, ladies, yes, yes, yes.


104
00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:29.323
Partake, please.

105
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.455
Okay.

106
00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:34.241
A cheers to Danielle,

107
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.939
who is the bestest friend
anyone can have


108
00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:40.987
and the hottest
and newest single thang


109
00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:42.945
- to hit the town.
- Oh, yeah.


110
00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:44.792
Okay, I'm telling ya,
when people think about divorce,


111
00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:47.819
they do not picture
this little number, okay?


112
00:07:47.907 --> 00:07:49.821
To Danielle.

113
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:52.912
- Cheers.
- Cheers to that.


114
00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:59.266
Danielle Banks,
celebrating a divorce.


115
00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:01.268
Ooh, let's go look at the view.

116
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.444
Let's feel free.

117
00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:10.016
Oh, this is beautiful!

118
00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:12.105
It's just what I needed.

119
00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:18.938
And whatever you want to do
this weekend, we're doing it.


120
00:08:19.068 --> 00:08:21.636
Unless you don't say,
"Let's go to the beach,"


121
00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:23.986
'cause then
we're gonna have problems.


122
00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:25.683
I'm kidding!

123
00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:27.120
Kind of.

124
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.948
The beach would be perfect.

125
00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:31.080
The beach it is.

126
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:32.473
To the beach.

127
00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:43.266
What about right here?

128
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:46.966
Ooh, actually, how about
all the way over there?


129
00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:48.880
What? Close to all those guys?

130
00:08:48.968 --> 00:08:50.839
Those hot guys playing football?

131
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.319
- Uh, yeah.
- Well,


132
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.321
I just brought my book
and I'm good.


133
00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:57.628
Okay, well, you can read
your book over there.


134
00:08:57.715 --> 00:09:03.460
We'll be two single women
in their prime against one.


135
00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:04.766
Yeah, I like that.

136
00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:05.897
Come on!

137
00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:08.161
- She does have a point.
- I know.


138
00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:13.862
Run, single lady, run!

139
00:09:13.993 --> 00:09:15.820
Woo!

140
00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.870
Ugh, oh my God, this is amazing.

141
00:09:22.001 --> 00:09:23.441
Why don't we live like this
every day


142
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.525
for the rest of our lives?

143
00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:26.483
Some people got to work.

144
00:09:26.614 --> 00:09:28.398
I like my job.

145
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.662
The stories I share
with my community


146
00:09:31.749 --> 00:09:34.100
Well, that's why you're
the best news producer I know.


147
00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:37.364
How many news producers
do you know?


148
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.497
- Do you want a compliment?
- I'll take it.


149
00:09:40.584 --> 00:09:41.933
Oh, I need another drink.

150
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:44.545
Want to head back to the house?

151
00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:47.374
Actually, I have a better idea.

152
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:52.814
Dani, why don't you go see
what is in those guys' cooler?


153
00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:54.381
Why me?

154
00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:57.514
Because that guy
keeps looking over here


155
00:09:57.645 --> 00:10:01.475
and he ain't looking at me.

156
00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:03.651
Because her hat is so big
it covers half her face.


157
00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:07.176
They can't even see
what she looks like.


158
00:10:07.263 --> 00:10:09.309
- He's kind of cute.
- See?


159
00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:10.527
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

160
00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:12.573
Come on.

161
00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:15.054
Okay, I'm going.

162
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:16.881
Ah, lose that shirt.

163
00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:20.798
- Shirt.
- Woo-hoo!


164
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.934
So what do you think,
is this gonna work?


165
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:27.762
Let's hope so.

166
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:33.985
- Hi.
- Hi.


167
00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:36.075
We were just watching
you guys play


168
00:10:36.205 --> 00:10:38.077
and it looks like
you are having fun.


169
00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:39.948
- Yeah.
- That's not what I meant to say.


170
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.341
What I meant was...

171
00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:42.428
I'm Jack.

172
00:10:42.472 --> 00:10:44.170
Jack, hi.

173
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.128
Uh, nice to meet you.

174
00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:48.565
So, we're on vacation, and we...

175
00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:51.568
- And you are?
- Out of practice.


176
00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:54.180
What?

177
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.313
- I'm Danielle.
- Nice to meet you too, Danielle.


178
00:10:57.444 --> 00:10:59.074
Would you and your friends
like to come over?


179
00:10:59.098 --> 00:11:01.274
We're finished playing
for the day.


180
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.885
- Really?
- Yeah, uh, and maybe


181
00:11:03.972 --> 00:11:07.236
it'll get your friend
to stop staring at us.


182
00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.977
They're calling us.

183

187
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:22.643
Hi. Hannah.

188
00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:25.385

You're a very pretty man,
you know that?


197
00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:54.667
I don't think I've ever been
called pretty before,


198
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.867
but I'm glad you think so.

199
00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:00.480
I need to go back to the house.

200
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.222
Uh, I have to go back.

201
00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:05.354
- Go back? Now?
- Yeah, you can stay.


202
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:09.967
I just... the drinks and the sun.

203
00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:14.842
Uh, I wouldn't mind taking you,
if that's not weird.


204
00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:16.887
I don't think so.

205
00:13:16.974 --> 00:13:18.411
Okay.

206
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:20.195
I'll help you with your stuff.

207
00:13:20.326 --> 00:13:21.544
Okay.

208
00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.296
Let the vacation really begin.

209
00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:57.014
I had a really nice time today.

210
00:13:57.145 --> 00:13:58.494
So did I.

211
00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:03.673
I'll just set this down
and, uh, I'll be going.


212
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.066
Should I put it
in the back yard?


213
00:14:05.196 --> 00:14:06.763
Oh, there is fine.

214
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.417
- Okay.
- Okay.


215
00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:17.992
So...

216
00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:21.778
Um, well, I should be going.

217
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:26.609
Mm.

218
00:14:31.048 --> 00:14:32.876
Too much?

219
00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:35.705
Not enough.

220
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.620
Are you thirsty?

221
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.363
We have champagne and champagne.

222
00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:44.453
Champagne.

223
00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:55.377
- Wow, this house is...
- Not a nightmare?


224
00:14:57.423 --> 00:15:00.991
Yeah, definitely
not a nightmare.


225
00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:03.951
What a view.

226
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:05.692
It's beautiful.

227
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.998
This is the perfect day.

228
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.134
You're not married, are you?

229
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.527
No.

230
00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:16.355
Why?

231
00:15:16.442 --> 00:15:18.139
Because I am, technically,

232
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:20.533
but that is over and done with.

233
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.727
That's why you're here, right?

234
00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:23.797
Celebrating the divorce.

235
00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:27.017
- So, Alesha told you, huh?
- Yeah, pretty much,


236
00:15:27.104 --> 00:15:28.932
as soon as you left
to go to the restroom.


237
00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.194
Got it.

238
00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:34.068
Are you cool with that?

239
00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:35.852
He's not gonna be
showing up here, is he?


240
00:15:35.983 --> 00:15:37.288
Not a chance.

241
00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:39.421
Then I'm cool.

242
00:15:39.552 --> 00:15:41.075
Okay.

243
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.371
What is that?

244
00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:17.938
It's the front door.

245
00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:24.247
Hey.

246
00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:30.516
Well, hello, Mr. Jack.

247
00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:36.522
Uh, have you two
been behaving yourselves?


248
00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:39.002
What time is it?

249
00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:41.222
It's dinnertime, babe.

250
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:43.790
And I am starving!

251
00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:48.142
Sorry about the knocking.

252
00:16:48.229 --> 00:16:50.318
This one here lost her key.

253
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:54.844
I didn't so much lose it as...

254
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.020
I don't have it.

255
00:16:57.151 --> 00:16:58.650
It's okay, I'm sure
we can get another one


256
00:16:58.674 --> 00:17:00.676
from the rental company.

257
00:17:00.807 --> 00:17:02.330
I'm feeling like sushi.

258
00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:05.768
- Is everyone okay with that?
- Yeah.


259
00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:10.294
Uh, thank you, but I should
actually get going.


260
00:17:10.381 --> 00:17:12.253
- Oh, okay.
- I have surf lessons


261
00:17:12.383 --> 00:17:14.864
early in the morning that I need
to be well-rested for.


262
00:17:14.995 --> 00:17:17.171
Can't have my students
drowning on me, can I?


263
00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:19.259
That would not be good
for business.


264
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.828
Not at all, but I'd love
to take you out tomorrow


265
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:26.441
- on a real date.
- I would like that.


266
00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:28.138
Can you just do me one favor?

267
00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:31.838
- What's that?
- Can we not call it a date?


268
00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.250
With everything
I'm going through.


269
00:17:33.274 --> 00:17:36.016
Uh, yeah. Uh, not a date.

270
00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:38.409
We can call it
a "casual hangout."


271
00:17:38.497 --> 00:17:39.498
I like it.

272
00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:42.370
- Lame!
- Yeah.


273
00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.721
I'm sorry, for the first time
I have to side with...


274
00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:47.462
It's lame.

275
00:17:49.159 --> 00:17:52.032
How about we meet at the canals,
like 7:00?


276
00:17:52.162 --> 00:17:53.294
Sounds good.

277
00:17:53.424 --> 00:17:55.688
Sounds like a non-date.

278
00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:59.822
Perfect.

279
00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.650
I'll walk you out.

280
00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:18.667
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.


281
00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:26.153
I'll be there!

282
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.609
Thank you, man.

283
00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:50.394
Have a good night.

284
00:19:18.422 --> 00:19:19.859
Who are you?

285
00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:20.947
Stop!

286
00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:06.966
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.


287
00:21:07.096 --> 00:21:09.795
- Have you seen my bracelet?
- What bracelet?


288
00:21:09.882 --> 00:21:11.797
Yeah, what bracelet?

289
00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:13.842
- Never mind.
- Okay, well, what are you doing?


290
00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:16.018
You should come,
you should join us.


291
00:21:16.105 --> 00:21:18.629
- I was just getting ready.
- Getting ready?


292
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.764
Girl, it's, like, noon
and aren't you meeting him


293
00:21:22.851 --> 00:21:25.201
- She's nervous.
- Okay, it's not noon,


294
00:21:25.332 --> 00:21:26.942
and I'm not nervous.

295
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:30.554
I just haven't been
on a first date in a long time.


296
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.297
Oh, I thought it wasn't a date.

297
00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:37.648
With a guy who isn't Craig
in a long time.


298
00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:39.868
Well, what about yesterday?

299
00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:41.355
Okay, you don't
have to answer that.


300
00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:44.830
Just come over here
and chill with us.


301
00:21:44.917 --> 00:21:46.614
I can't sit.

302
00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:48.224
Uh, okay, then we'll go out.

303
00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:49.530
Okay, where should we go?

304
00:21:49.617 --> 00:21:51.140
Well, it's a beach town.

305
00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:53.621
Let's go walk around,
see the beach,


306
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:57.277
get out some of that
nervous/not nervous energy


307
00:21:57.364 --> 00:22:01.063
and possibly get you
something sexy to wear tonight.


308
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.371
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?


309
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:06.982
Hannah?

310
00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:08.288
Yeah, we're going out.

311
00:22:08.418 --> 00:22:10.899
- Yeah, let's go out.
- Okay.


312
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.685
♪ Forget everything I know, oh

313
00:22:14.773 --> 00:22:17.776
Don't fall in silly!

314
00:22:17.863 --> 00:22:19.995
You know I'm the clumsiest
out of the three of us.


315
00:22:23.129 --> 00:22:25.305
♪ Found my way
back to you, ooh ♪


316

♪ Go where you
want to go, oh ♪

317
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.667
You want us to hang around
until he gets here?


318
00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:42.801
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

319
00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:44.367
Okay, good luck, honey.

320
00:22:44.454 --> 00:22:46.979
- Text us if you need anything.
- I will.


321
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:52.114
You look stunning.

322
00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:54.116
- Stop.
- No, she's right.


323
00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:55.335
You look beautiful.

324
00:22:55.422 --> 00:22:56.422
Thank you.

325
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.990
Love you, guys.

326
00:22:59.905 --> 00:23:01.080
And we love you.

327
00:23:01.167 --> 00:23:02.603
Enjoy.

328
00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:05.345
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.


329
00:24:37.002 --> 00:24:38.196
Oh, hey, do you want to get
something to eat?


330
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.181
- Yeah, sure.
- Do you still


331
00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:44.487
Oh, I don't know,
I'm a little tired.


332
00:24:44.574 --> 00:24:45.924
Plus, it's not
what it used to be.


333
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:48.187
Eh. Oh, hang on.

334
00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:52.234
It's Danielle.

335
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:54.758
- Hello?
- Jack ghosted me.


336
00:24:54.845 --> 00:24:56.543
- What?
- Yeah.


337
00:24:56.673 --> 00:25:00.025
I called and texted,
and he never showed up.


338
00:25:00.112 --> 00:25:02.766
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.


339
00:25:02.853 --> 00:25:06.901
It's okay, I guess this is
what dating is like now.


340
00:25:07.032 --> 00:25:08.294
Where are you?

341
00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:10.470
I'm walking back to the rental.

342
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.212
We're gonna get
something to eat.


343
00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:17.390
I'd rather just go back
and curl into a ball.


344
00:25:17.477 --> 00:25:19.237
Well, we're gonna grab
something really quickly,


345
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.500
and then we're gonna head back
as soon as possible, okay?


346
00:25:21.524 --> 00:25:22.961
Yeah, sounds good.

347
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:25.485
- See you soon.
- Okay, babe.


348
00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:30.490
- What a jerk.
- Yeah, he seemed so nice.


349
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.536
Men.

350
00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:11.591
Help!

351
00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:13.332
Help!

352
00:27:16.117 --> 00:27:17.771
Please, someone help me!

353
00:27:17.901 --> 00:27:19.338
Someone just tried to attack me!

354
00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:27.346
- Call 911.
- Are you okay?


355
00:27:31.437 --> 00:27:33.091
And you saw no one
in the immediate area


356
00:27:33.221 --> 00:27:35.919
when you approached the house?

357
00:27:36.006 --> 00:27:38.966
There were a couple people
on the street.


358
00:27:39.097 --> 00:27:41.011
They were the ones
who helped me.


359
00:27:41.099 --> 00:27:43.318
So, this Jack,

360
00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:45.929
did you happen
to catch his last name?


361
00:27:46.016 --> 00:27:47.235
No.

362
00:27:47.322 --> 00:27:49.672
I have his phone number.

363
00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:52.414
We'll need that later.

364
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.634
Your attacker got into a van.

365
00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:58.899
Yeah, it was, um...

366
00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:01.771
It was a gray van.

367
00:28:01.858 --> 00:28:03.730
No windows.

368
00:28:05.558 --> 00:28:08.691
There wasn't a lot of light.

369
00:28:08.778 --> 00:28:11.520
Did you see
a license plate at all?


370
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.827
- No.
- Anything unusual on the van:


371
00:28:13.957 --> 00:28:16.873
scratches, dents,
bumper stickers?


372
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.094
I don't know,
it was just a gray van.


373
00:28:31.671 --> 00:28:33.977
Excuse me. Just a moment.

374
00:28:35.588 --> 00:28:37.285
Can I help you, gentlemen?

375
00:28:37.372 --> 00:28:39.461
This is a crime scene
if you couldn't tell.


376
00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.376
Apparently.

377
00:28:41.507 --> 00:28:43.596
Anton King, I'm head
of security operations


378
00:28:43.683 --> 00:28:45.641
in this region for Escape Pads.

379
00:28:45.728 --> 00:28:48.557
This is Michael Snyder,
my assistant.


380
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:51.343
We work for the company
that owns this property.


381
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.780
I see. And...

382
00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:56.043
And your department contacted us

383
00:28:56.174 --> 00:28:57.412
about the incident that occurred

384
00:28:57.436 --> 00:29:00.482
early this evening.

385
00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:03.920
- Is that the victim?
- It is.


386
00:29:04.007 --> 00:29:07.620
She's a little occupied
at the moment.


387
00:29:07.707 --> 00:29:12.059
We just wondered
if we could speak with her


388
00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:13.974
I don't think
that'll be possible, fellas.


389
00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:17.151
I'd be glad to talk
to the two of you eventually,


390
00:29:17.282 --> 00:29:19.893
but you need to leave
while I'm investigating here.


391
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.809
If I could just speak
to the client for one second.


392
00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:26.204
I'm sure you have her
contact information on file.


393
00:29:26.291 --> 00:29:33.080
You can establish whatever
contact you need that way, okay?


394
00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:36.170
Lou, can you show these guys
out for me?


395
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:38.999
No, got it, got it.

396
00:29:55.842 --> 00:29:58.105
So no sign of forced entry
at all?


397
00:30:07.767 --> 00:30:10.248
So, what are your thoughts?

398
00:30:10.335 --> 00:30:13.729
Well, obviously this Jack
is our primary suspect.


399
00:30:13.816 --> 00:30:16.471
We didn't find any signs
of forced entry


400
00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:19.126
and he was inside the night
before the attack.


401
00:30:20.649 --> 00:30:22.390
But how...

402
00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:24.479
What?

403
00:30:24.566 --> 00:30:27.830
I lost my key.

404
00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:31.007
Okay... well, when Hannah and I
got back from the beach,


405
00:30:31.138 --> 00:30:33.445
he was already inside
with Danielle.


406
00:30:33.575 --> 00:30:35.882
In fact, he had to let us in.

407
00:30:36.012 --> 00:30:39.842
That's very helpful to know.

408
00:30:39.929 --> 00:30:41.409
We don't know what happened.

409
00:30:41.496 --> 00:30:43.672
We don't even know
if the key was used.


410
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:46.153
Just focus
on helping your friend.


411
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.242
Okay? Hold on to this.

412
00:30:48.373 --> 00:30:49.852
I gave one to Danielle,

413
00:30:49.983 --> 00:30:51.308
but people in her state
can get, you know,


414
00:30:51.332 --> 00:30:52.377
a little frazzled.

415
00:30:54.335 --> 00:30:55.335
Okay.

416
00:31:10.656 --> 00:31:12.484
Did the detective leave?

417
00:31:12.614 --> 00:31:14.616
Yes, Detective Greer said

418
00:31:14.703 --> 00:31:17.227
we can pack up our things
and go home


419
00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:21.144
and they'll call us
if anything develops.


420
00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:24.017
Well, there's not much else
they can do right now.


421
00:31:25.932 --> 00:31:28.282
What do you wanna do, Dani?

422
00:31:28.369 --> 00:31:30.042
Do you need some time
before we hit the road


423
00:31:30.066 --> 00:31:31.851
or do you want to go now?

424
00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.768
♪ I just want to pack our bags
and go.


425
00:31:40.642 --> 00:31:41.861
Hang on, I'll get that.

426
00:31:47.649 --> 00:31:49.608
Hi, we spoke earlier.

427
00:31:49.738 --> 00:31:53.263
I'm Anton King, head of security
for Escape Pads.


428
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:55.222
This is my associate, Michael.

429
00:31:55.353 --> 00:31:57.485
You can call me Mike.

430
00:31:57.616 --> 00:32:00.401
So, are you guys here to give us
a refund or something?


431
00:32:00.488 --> 00:32:02.577
We'd be happy to put you up
in a premium rental


432
00:32:02.708 --> 00:32:05.232
for the remainder of your stay
if you like.


433
00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:06.799
Yeah, it's not the size
of the house


434
00:32:06.886 --> 00:32:08.670
that's the problem, Michael.

435
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:11.586
- Mike.
- Okay, um,


436
00:32:11.717 --> 00:32:14.415
I know that this
is a sensitive time.


437
00:32:14.546 --> 00:32:16.417
We were just wondering
if we can ask you


438
00:32:16.504 --> 00:32:18.288
some questions
about the incident.


439
00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:21.161
It's just security protocol

440
00:32:21.248 --> 00:32:25.818
for when or if any crimes
happen on our properties.


441
00:32:25.905 --> 00:32:27.863
Well, now's not
a very good time.


442
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.518
Oh, oh, I understand.

443
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:35.262
Well, um, maybe we could
come back tomorrow morning


444
00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:38.047
after you've had
a good night's rest.


445
00:32:38.178 --> 00:32:41.355
Yeah, we're... we're not staying
the night, you know,


446
00:32:41.442 --> 00:32:43.575
with a guy breaking in
and attacking my friend.


447
00:32:43.662 --> 00:32:45.533
- Yeah, sorry.
- Just didn't seem like


448
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.926
the right thing.

449
00:32:47.056 --> 00:32:47.840
Leaving this late?

450
00:32:47.927 --> 00:32:48.841
How far is home?

451
00:32:48.928 --> 00:32:50.843
Lakeview.

452
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.457
Oh, um, it's on your paperwork.

453
00:32:56.588 --> 00:32:58.764
I took a look
before we came over.


454
00:32:58.851 --> 00:32:59.982
So you're close.

455
00:33:00.113 --> 00:33:02.071
That's great.

456
00:33:02.202 --> 00:33:03.899
Is everything okay?

457
00:33:03.986 --> 00:33:05.945
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.


458
00:33:06.032 --> 00:33:08.251
Well, we'll leave you alone,

459
00:33:08.338 --> 00:33:12.734
and when you're ready to talk,
you have my information.


460
00:33:12.821 --> 00:33:14.649
It's going to be
a short discussion.


461
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.825
We just need some things
for our records.


462
00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:18.566
Do we have to come back here?

463
00:33:18.653 --> 00:33:21.177
No, ma'am, we'll come to you.

464
00:33:21.264 --> 00:33:24.529
Okay, it was nice
meeting you ladies.


465
00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:25.791
Thank you.

466
00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:35.322
Okay, I think we've had enough
for one night, yeah?


467
00:33:35.453 --> 00:33:36.758
Yeah. Thank you, guys.

468
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:41.154
Did you contact Pennington yet?

469
00:33:41.284 --> 00:33:42.372
Waiting to hear back.

470
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.940
You know, that's him right now.

471
00:33:45.027 --> 00:33:48.553
He's said he's looking into it,
he'll text us.


472
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.078
Until we get this police report,
it's hard to tell.


473
00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:55.951
I want to have zero liability
attached to this one.


474
00:33:56.082 --> 00:33:57.300
Can you handle that?

475
00:34:00.303 --> 00:34:02.088
Why do I even have you?

476
00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:05.047
As of now, it seems like
a B&E gone wrong.


477
00:34:05.178 --> 00:34:06.808
If that holds,
it should stay out of the paper


478
00:34:06.832 --> 00:34:08.921
and maybe nothing'll come of it.

479
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.358
Or maybe it's Portland
all over again.


480
00:34:11.445 --> 00:34:13.534
Or Denver.

481
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:16.058
Denver went away.

482
00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.583
That never happened
as far as I'm concerned.


483
00:34:18.713 --> 00:34:20.106
Okay.

484
00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:24.632
Another silly,
stupid little girl


485
00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.112
gets herself into danger,

486
00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.418
and somehow
it's our responsibility?


487
00:34:28.505 --> 00:34:31.333
How is any of this our fault?

488
00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:33.336
This doesn't even make sense.

489
00:34:34.947 --> 00:34:36.296
I guess not.

490
00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:47.481
Oh.

491
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:52.791
There it is.

492
00:35:56.768 --> 00:35:58.639
Anton, where have you been?

493
00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:01.381
At work again paying
for this one-bedroom dump?


494
00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:03.601
Where's the money you promised
when we got married?


495
00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:07.387
Anton, you can't even provide
security for your family.


496
00:36:07.474 --> 00:36:09.215
Don't you dare take my son.

497
00:36:09.302 --> 00:36:10.782
This marriage is over.

498
00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:12.871
I am sick of wasting my life

499
00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:16.962
with someone who can't even
take care of us.


500
00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:20.356
You'll never,
ever hear from us again.


501
00:36:20.487 --> 00:36:22.141
Why are you doing this?

502
00:36:22.271 --> 00:36:24.796
Why are you doing this to us?

503
00:36:24.883 --> 00:36:28.669
What kind of a woman
could ever love you?


504
00:36:30.236 --> 00:36:32.064
You're pathetic.

505
00:36:32.194 --> 00:36:35.284
How could another woman stand
to be with you?


506
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:37.330
Is there someone else?

507
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.853
Tell me!

508
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.204
I'm asking you,
is there someone else?


509
00:36:42.335 --> 00:36:44.076
Answer me, who is he?

510
00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:46.339
You don't deserve love.

511
00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:50.473
No woman could ever love you.

512
00:36:58.612 --> 00:36:59.787
Police.

513
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:24.725
Hello? Mr. Casey?

514
00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.119
Are you home?

515
00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:50.490
Let's move.

516
00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:09.335
Let's collect this boot print
just in case.


517
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.994
Let's see if he has
his employers listed online.


518
00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:02.170
Oh, hi,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.


519
00:39:02.301 --> 00:39:04.782
No problem, Mrs. Banks,
thank you for meeting with us.


520
00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:05.869
Sure. Come in.

521
00:39:05.913 --> 00:39:07.262
Thank you.

522
00:39:17.707 --> 00:39:20.885
I didn't realize you were here.

523
00:39:20.972 --> 00:39:24.105
Well, it'll be good
to get your perspective as well.


524
00:39:24.192 --> 00:39:26.586
How are you doing?

525
00:39:26.716 --> 00:39:28.631
- I'm okay.
- Good, good.


526
00:39:28.718 --> 00:39:31.330
Before we get into anything,

527
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.072
I just want to express
that Escape Pads


528
00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:38.032
is very upset at what happened
and our main concern is you.


529
00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:40.905
We just have a few details
we need to clear up


530
00:39:41.035 --> 00:39:43.255
so we can get a better picture
of what happened.


531
00:39:43.385 --> 00:39:46.432
Do you by chance have a copy
of the police report.


532
00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:48.608
It's on the counter
in the manila envelope.


533
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:52.307
Yep, I got it.

534
00:39:52.394 --> 00:39:55.049
Thank you.

535
00:39:55.136 --> 00:39:59.706
Um, the report should handle
most our questions, really.


536
00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:01.873
That you know that Escape Pads
is on your side and...


537
00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:08.889
And we just want to make sure
that all our bases are covered.


538
00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:10.499
Get the forms out, please.

539
00:40:12.545 --> 00:40:15.243
Now, these are
standard insurance forms


540
00:40:15.374 --> 00:40:19.291
we need you to review
and sign off for us.


541
00:40:22.903 --> 00:40:24.818
You should take your time
reading that.


542
00:40:26.776 --> 00:40:28.213
What is this?

543
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.215
Waiving liability?

544
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:33.000
It's...

545
00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:37.222
Are you trying to ensure
that I don't sue you?


546
00:40:39.137 --> 00:40:42.967
I'm sorry,
I can't sign anything like that.


547
00:40:43.097 --> 00:40:46.709
Well, we're not trying
to make you feel compelled


548
00:40:46.796 --> 00:40:49.234
to sign anything right now.

549
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:52.672
We'll leave these here and you
can look over them tonight...


550
00:40:52.802 --> 00:40:54.630
With her attorney.

551
00:40:54.761 --> 00:40:56.632
Maybe you saw her
at the house with us.


552
00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:59.679
I'm sure she'd have
a few thoughts about this.


553
00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:02.464
Mm-hm.

554
00:41:02.595 --> 00:41:04.989
I think you and your friend
have the wrong idea


555
00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:08.557
about our intentions.

556
00:41:08.644 --> 00:41:12.953
We are just as upset about this
as you are, ma'am.


557
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.912
You're just here
to cover your asses.


558
00:41:16.435 --> 00:41:18.480
I'm here to help, ma'am,

559
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:20.197
and, frankly,
I don't appreciate the tone


560
00:41:20.221 --> 00:41:22.397
that this conversation
is taking.


561
00:41:22.484 --> 00:41:24.182
Our company didn't ask
your friend here


562
00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:26.967
to cavort around town
with strange men.


563
00:41:27.054 --> 00:41:29.187
I mean, am I right?

564
00:41:29.274 --> 00:41:31.232
What did you just say?

565
00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:33.399
- We should really be...
- I think you should get out.


566
00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:37.456
I said get out.

567
00:41:40.763 --> 00:41:43.375
You have a wonderful day.

568
00:41:43.505 --> 00:41:45.725
Um, can we have those back,
please?


569
00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:49.207
Of course.

570
00:42:07.747 --> 00:42:10.489
Not a good showing, Michael.

571
00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:12.099
We're gonna have a serious talk.

572
00:42:31.423 --> 00:42:33.860
If he thinks
we are not suing him now.


573
00:42:34.774 --> 00:42:35.993
Ooh, that piece of...

574
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.343
How did he know about Jack?

575
00:42:39.692 --> 00:42:41.607
He barely looked at this.

576
00:42:41.737 --> 00:42:46.264
How did he know I met up
with Jack the night before?


577
00:42:46.351 --> 00:42:48.309
♪ Well, he was there
when the police came.


578
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.007
Maybe he talked to one of them.

579
00:42:50.094 --> 00:42:52.139
I guess so.

580
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.967
Why were they there?

581
00:42:54.098 --> 00:42:56.535
How did they get there so fast?

582
00:42:58.754 --> 00:43:00.887
Maybe he tripped an alarm?

583
00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:05.152
But the guy who attacked me
was inside when I got back.


584
00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:07.241
There wasn't an alarm going off.

585
00:43:07.328 --> 00:43:08.634
Did you even see an alarm?

586
00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:12.420
No.

587
00:43:12.551 --> 00:43:15.075
There's something up with him.

588
00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:17.208
Look, the police
will figure it out.


589
00:43:18.644 --> 00:43:19.906
Who are you calling?

590
00:43:19.993 --> 00:43:21.734
Hannah.

591
00:43:21.821 --> 00:43:23.475
I wanna see what she thinks.

592
00:43:34.268 --> 00:43:35.400
Jack?

593
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.142
You home?

594
00:43:38.272 --> 00:43:39.708
Dad sent me over.

595
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.198
Jack?

596
00:43:51.285 --> 00:43:53.766
Why haven't you been answering
any of our calls?


597
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.291
It stinks in here, bro.

598
00:43:57.422 --> 00:43:58.782
You gotta really learn
to clean up.


599
00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:14.917
Hey, I'm headed out
to see Hannah.


600
00:44:15.048 --> 00:44:16.658
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.


601
00:44:16.745 --> 00:44:18.530
You need nutrition.

602
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.142
You've been stressed,
so I made you this.


603
00:44:22.273 --> 00:44:23.839
This looks delicious.

604
00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:25.276
Mm, mm.

605
00:44:25.363 --> 00:44:27.669
It is delicious,
but I really have to go.


606
00:44:27.756 --> 00:44:30.672
Okay, just give me like
two minutes and I'll be ready.


607
00:44:30.803 --> 00:44:32.805
Girl, seriously,
it's not a big deal.


608
00:44:32.892 --> 00:44:34.546
I survived, right?

609
00:44:37.505 --> 00:44:40.117
I have to know
I can handle this by myself.


610
00:44:40.204 --> 00:44:42.815
- You trust me?
- Yeah.


611
00:44:42.902 --> 00:44:47.211
Wait, hang on,
just as long as you take this.


612
00:44:48.473 --> 00:44:50.214
Okay. For you.

613
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.955
Be safe.

614
00:44:53.042 --> 00:44:54.305
Love you!

615
00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:04.445
When you booked it
is pretty concrete.


616
00:45:04.532 --> 00:45:07.448
I mean,
nobody really reads those.


617
00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:11.104
But we can establish malice
based on how derelict they are


618
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:14.368
in their responsibility
to their clients.


619
00:45:14.499 --> 00:45:18.198
We have a case, but it could be
a tough road though,


620
00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:20.766
and after everything
you've been through,


621
00:45:20.853 --> 00:45:22.507
- I don't think you sh...
- I wanna do it.


622
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.816
The way those men treated me.

623
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.882
And these vultures
don't let a day go by


624
00:45:30.906 --> 00:45:34.693
before they show up at my house
and try to hustle me.


625
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.435
I don't want that to happen
to anyone else.


626
00:45:37.565 --> 00:45:39.045
All right.

627
00:45:39.132 --> 00:45:42.396
We're gonna see it through
the whole way.


628
00:45:42.483 --> 00:45:43.484
Thank you.

629
00:45:45.138 --> 00:45:47.880
So, how much do I owe you?

630
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.379
- Hannah, you have to let...
- No, no, no.


631
00:45:49.403 --> 00:45:52.754
Stop.

632
00:45:52.885 --> 00:45:54.930
I'm gonna take care
of things here.


633
00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:57.368
You'll relax.

634
00:45:57.455 --> 00:45:59.979
Well, I'm headed to the spa,

635
00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:01.676
so that should be no problem.

636
00:46:01.807 --> 00:46:03.896
- By yourself?
- Yeah.


637
00:46:03.983 --> 00:46:06.507
Oh, but I could go with you.

638
00:46:06.594 --> 00:46:08.814
I would love that,
but aren't you busy?


639
00:46:08.944 --> 00:46:12.687
Well, I can push things back
and then...


640
00:46:12.774 --> 00:46:14.863
I literally
just talked to Alesha


641
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.431
about treating me like a victim.

642
00:46:17.518 --> 00:46:18.780
All right.

643
00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:20.826
You enjoy yourself.

644
00:46:20.956 --> 00:46:22.349
Thank you.

645
00:46:41.934 --> 00:46:43.979
Afternoon, gentlemen.

646
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.243
Wasn't expecting a visit
from you.


647
00:46:46.373 --> 00:46:48.332
Is this an all right time?

648
00:46:48.462 --> 00:46:50.334
Yeah, we were just
finishing up our review


649
00:46:50.464 --> 00:46:52.466
on your case just now.

650
00:46:52.553 --> 00:46:54.512
Well, I'd like to follow up
with you gentlemen


651
00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:55.687
on a couple of things.

652
00:46:55.774 --> 00:46:57.384
It'll be a minute of your time.

653
00:46:57.471 --> 00:46:59.299
- Gladly.
- I'm just a little curious


654
00:46:59.386 --> 00:47:01.867
about these electronic locks
on the property.


655
00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:04.173
How simple would it be to...

656
00:47:04.304 --> 00:47:07.089
I guess the term is override
them and gain access inside?


657
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.962
Well, each property belongs
to an individual owner,


658
00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:13.182
and we act as the liaison
between both parties.


659
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.881
Oh, so your company
has no physical ownership


660
00:47:15.968 --> 00:47:18.057
- over the places you rent.
- Not as such.


661
00:47:18.144 --> 00:47:21.278
I mean, there's some premium
properties that we own outright,


662
00:47:21.365 --> 00:47:24.281
but for the most part
we're the middleman.


663
00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:30.374
Do you need me
to elaborate on that?


664
00:47:30.504 --> 00:47:31.853
No.

665
00:47:31.984 --> 00:47:33.942
I'm just at a loss here.

666
00:47:34.029 --> 00:47:36.118
My technician
that examined the system


667
00:47:36.205 --> 00:47:38.947
says it's very securely
encrypted.


668
00:47:39.034 --> 00:47:41.298
Someone would have
to have a key to enter,


669
00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:44.083
or be one hell
of an electronics wiz


670
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.041
to bypass it.

671
00:47:46.128 --> 00:47:49.218
That should narrow things
down a bit.


672
00:47:49.306 --> 00:47:52.309
Well, I'd like to talk
to the owner, if possible.


673
00:47:53.832 --> 00:47:56.443
I can't find
any contact information for.


674
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.638
I'm sorry,
we can't give you that.


675
00:47:57.662 --> 00:47:59.577
That's private information.

676
00:47:59.664 --> 00:48:02.841
We're not in the business
of betraying our clients.


677
00:48:02.971 --> 00:48:04.756
There are legal channels
you can go through


678
00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:06.888
to request such information,

679
00:48:06.975 --> 00:48:10.327
but I'm sure
you're aware of that.


680
00:48:10.414 --> 00:48:12.503
You know, fellas,

681
00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:15.767
I understand your interest
is to limit your liability


682
00:48:15.854 --> 00:48:17.638
and your client's liability.

683
00:48:17.769 --> 00:48:19.988
Now I'm not looking to put
the owner of this property


684
00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:22.251
in any kind of legal bind.

685
00:48:22.382 --> 00:48:25.124
I just want to have a little
chat to help with this case,


686
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:26.995
see if I can access
any security footage,


687
00:48:27.082 --> 00:48:29.084
- things like that.
- Oh, I'm certain


688
00:48:29.215 --> 00:48:32.697
that your intentions
are pure, Detective,


689
00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:37.223
I just... I just wouldn't be
doing my job if I did that.


690
00:48:37.354 --> 00:48:39.051
Our company
would be more than happy


691
00:48:39.138 --> 00:48:41.619
to fulfill any subpoenas
of our records.


692
00:48:41.706 --> 00:48:46.014
And correct me if I'm wrong,
I thought you had a suspect.


693
00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:47.538
Wouldn't your time
be better spent


694
00:48:47.668 --> 00:48:50.715
talking to him about all this?

695
00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:53.152
The strange man
that she spread her legs for


696
00:48:53.282 --> 00:48:55.284
the night before.

697
00:48:55.415 --> 00:48:58.026
I would.

698
00:48:58.113 --> 00:49:00.159
But he was found dead
in his home.


699
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:04.381
That would make it difficult.

700
00:49:06.557 --> 00:49:08.472
I'll get those subpoenas
over to you


701
00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.212
as soon as possible.

702
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.755
That one has a major problem.

703
00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:33.061
She seems reasonable enough.

704
00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:36.717
I mean...

705
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:40.808
Whose side are you on here,
Mike?


706
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:45.247
I didn't know
there were any sides.


707
00:49:45.378 --> 00:49:48.555
Okay, let me lay it out for you.

708
00:49:48.642 --> 00:49:50.383
Some loose girl
gets all liquored up


709
00:49:50.514 --> 00:49:53.473
and invites a stranger
into her home.


710
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.782
The next night, someone happens
to try to rape her.


711
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.262
Now we're being harassed
by a rinky-dink detective


712
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:01.960
that can't put
two and two together.


713
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.092
You get it?

714
00:50:04.223 --> 00:50:05.833
- I guess.
- "I guess."


715
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.357
"I don't know, I guess."

716
00:50:08.445 --> 00:50:09.576
I'm going to lunch.

717
00:51:00.322 --> 00:51:02.455
Built in 1995.

718
00:51:14.554 --> 00:51:16.643
The West Palm Beach incident.

719
00:51:29.917 --> 00:51:32.354
Who is Laura Winters?

720
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.367
All these incidents.

721
00:51:53.637 --> 00:51:55.160
Oh my God.

722
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.641
Anton's the trust holder?

723
00:53:48.795 --> 00:53:50.318
Craig, no.

724
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:32.143
He bleached his clothes.

725
00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:40.891
And Anton left in a van?

726
00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:42.172
I tried to get a picture of it,

727
00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:46.287
but it was the same van,
I know it.


728
00:54:50.422 --> 00:54:51.858
Dani.

729
00:54:51.989 --> 00:54:53.730
I know what I saw.

730
00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:54.905
I believe you.

731
00:54:56.689 --> 00:54:58.430
So what are you gonna do
about it?


732
00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.997
Call the detective.

733
00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:01.085
But...

734
00:55:03.304 --> 00:55:05.437
He bleached everything.

735
00:55:05.524 --> 00:55:08.483
It's not really evidence
if there's no DNA on it.


736
00:55:08.614 --> 00:55:10.355
Well, it could be.

737
00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:13.358
I need something more.

738
00:55:13.445 --> 00:55:14.707
No, no. No, no, no, no.

739
00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:17.405
Whatever it is
you're thinking, no.


740
00:55:17.492 --> 00:55:19.494
If he's this buttoned up
about things,


741
00:55:19.581 --> 00:55:21.496
it probably happened before.

742
00:55:21.627 --> 00:55:23.237
I need the full story.

743
00:55:23.324 --> 00:55:26.414
Let the police
get the full story.


744
00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:29.069
Look, Detective Greer
is on your side.


745
00:55:29.156 --> 00:55:30.723
You can trust her,

746
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.160
and I don't say that lightly.

747
00:55:52.092 --> 00:55:53.092
No!

748
00:55:56.488 --> 00:55:57.576
Help!

749
00:56:17.422 --> 00:56:18.640
Until this is situated,

750
00:56:18.727 --> 00:56:21.252
I don't feel comfortable
staying here.


751
00:56:21.382 --> 00:56:23.384
He knows where I live.

752
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:25.996
We know he's not afraid
to break into houses.


753
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.041
Yeah.

754
00:56:28.172 --> 00:56:29.695
Okay.

755
00:56:29.782 --> 00:56:33.742
As soon as I get to your place,
I'll call the detective.


756
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:35.701
Okay, thanks, babe.

757
00:56:35.832 --> 00:56:37.529
Bye.

758
00:56:37.616 --> 00:56:39.661
Hello, it's Craig.

759
00:56:39.748 --> 00:56:41.315
Please call back
when you get this.


760
00:56:48.061 --> 00:56:50.107
It's my house too, remember?

761
00:56:50.237 --> 00:56:52.544
It's good to be back.

762
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:54.894
I don't have anywhere else
to go.


763
00:56:55.025 --> 00:56:56.940
What about her place?

764
00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:00.334
Let's make a baby, baby.

765
00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.468
I gotta go.

766
00:57:03.555 --> 00:57:04.861
Didn't work out.

767
00:57:06.775 --> 00:57:08.057
Well, you can't be here
right now.


768
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:10.170
This is not a good place to be.

769
00:57:10.257 --> 00:57:12.999
What's that supposed to mean?

770
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.498
Seems like
it's the best place to be.


771
00:57:14.522 --> 00:57:15.393
You don't understand.

772
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.524
Dani.

773
00:57:18.048 --> 00:57:19.658
I don't have anywhere to go.

774
00:57:21.965 --> 00:57:22.835
Well, you should have
thought about that


775
00:57:22.966 --> 00:57:24.881
before you cheated on me.

776
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:35.065
Craig.

777
00:57:36.588 --> 00:57:38.503
Craig.

778
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.113
You have to go.

779
00:57:40.244 --> 00:57:42.333
Wow, you're more on edge
than normal.


780
00:57:42.463 --> 00:57:44.639
I was attacked.

781
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.076
What?

782
00:57:46.206 --> 00:57:47.642
Somebody tried to kill me.

783
00:57:47.729 --> 00:57:49.340
No, you're playing with me.

784
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.560
See for yourself.

785
00:57:55.912 --> 00:57:58.349
Look, I gotta leave,

786
00:57:58.436 --> 00:58:00.786
but you better not be here
when I get back.


787
00:58:03.484 --> 00:58:06.052
And take your stuff with you
this time.


788
00:58:06.139 --> 00:58:07.924
I'm not holding onto them
any longer.


789
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:10.160
Ow.

790
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.261
Aggravated assault.

791
00:59:24.348 --> 00:59:26.219
Walking home alone at night,

792
00:59:26.306 --> 00:59:28.439
date never showed up.

793
00:59:28.569 --> 00:59:32.617
Date? She was on a date?

794
00:59:32.704 --> 00:59:36.316
Yeah, she really was attacked.

795
00:59:36.403 --> 00:59:37.796
But why would you go
to the beach?


796
00:59:37.926 --> 00:59:40.016
Or at least tell me you're going
so I could...


797
00:59:46.544 --> 00:59:48.894
God, what was she thinking?

798
00:59:50.243 --> 00:59:51.853
She could have
just stayed with me,


799
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.508
just listened for once.

800
00:59:54.595 --> 00:59:56.771
How could this happen to her?

801
00:59:56.858 --> 00:59:58.251
It's not gonna happen again.

802
00:59:58.338 --> 00:59:59.948
I can protect her.

803
01:00:00.036 --> 01:00:02.255
I'm gonna keep her safe.

804
01:00:02.342 --> 01:00:04.142
It was this guy
that made her walk home alone.


805
01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:06.259
I would have never done that.

806
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:08.653
And you're positive
it was the same van?


807
01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.699
Absolutely, and the clothes
were in a black bag...


808
01:00:11.786 --> 01:00:14.224
What?

809
01:00:14.354 --> 01:00:16.182
I just realized
I left it at my house.


810
01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.793
Okay.

811
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.597
But I'll be there
first thing in the morning.


812
01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:21.970
We'll go over everything
carefully


813
01:00:22.058 --> 01:00:23.320
and make a statement.

814
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.583
You stay safe.

815
01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:27.474
And there's no way
he or anyone at the company


816
01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:30.153
has your friend's address,
is there?


817
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.893
Okay, good.

818
01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.591
I'll call you first thing
in the morning.


819
01:00:33.721 --> 01:00:35.332
Thank you, Detective.

820
01:00:35.419 --> 01:00:38.596
Danielle.

821
01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:42.600
What you did was very brave.

822
01:00:42.687 --> 01:00:45.646
You leave these things to me,
though.


823
01:00:45.777 --> 01:00:47.083
Okay, good night.

824
01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:48.170
Good night.

825
01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:04.535
Hello?

826
01:01:04.622 --> 01:01:05.797
Miss Banks?

827
01:01:05.884 --> 01:01:07.146
Who is this?

828
01:01:07.233 --> 01:01:10.106
It's Mike from Escape Pads.

829
01:01:10.193 --> 01:01:12.020
I have something
regarding your case


830
01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:13.935
to look into.

831
01:01:14.022 --> 01:01:15.111
Miss Banks?

832
01:01:15.198 --> 01:01:16.547
Yes, I'm here.

833
01:01:16.634 --> 01:01:18.375
I can't say a lot.

834
01:01:18.505 --> 01:01:22.074
Just try to get in touch
with a Laura Winters.


835
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:23.728
She's the owner of the property.

836
01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:25.033
How do I do that?

837
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.650
Mr. King?

838
01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:58.725
No, no, I'm sorry.

839
01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.379
I'm so sorry about that.

840
01:05:00.466 --> 01:05:01.772
I'm so sorry about that.

841
01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:06.777
Everything she did to you,

842
01:05:06.864 --> 01:05:09.345
she deserves
everything she gets.


843
01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:15.002
Just so you know,

844
01:05:15.089 --> 01:05:19.485
your death will not be in vain.

845
01:05:21.966 --> 01:05:24.360
I almost failed
for the first time.


846
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.542
Never made a mistake.

847
01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:36.197
Never even been suspected.

848
01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:41.986
This is all new to me.

849
01:05:42.073 --> 01:05:45.381
Then you come along,
and you make it so easy.


850
01:05:47.078 --> 01:05:50.734
The jilted spouse snaps,

851
01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.780
tries to kill the girl
and the lover.


852
01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:58.089
I mean, it's...
It's too perfect, isn't it?


853
01:05:58.219 --> 01:05:59.569
Huh?

854
01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:01.179
Isn't it?

855
01:06:06.489 --> 01:06:08.229
Thank you.

856
01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:49.940
Alesha was right.

857
01:07:50.027 --> 01:07:51.985
Should've blocked you.

858
01:07:56.816 --> 01:07:59.340
Love is a killer.

859
01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.161
Thanks, Detective.

860
01:10:04.248 --> 01:10:06.293
Yeah, we'll be here waiting.

861
01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:27.140
Craig?

862
01:10:32.537 --> 01:10:35.496
Craig? The bag is gone, did...

863
01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:45.985
Craig!

864
01:10:51.599 --> 01:10:53.514
Call 911!

865
01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:58.536
It was the exact same van,
I'm telling you.


866
01:11:58.623 --> 01:12:01.495
Craig wasn't a perfect person,

867
01:12:01.626 --> 01:12:05.021
but I know he wasn't the one
who attacked me that night.


868
01:12:05.108 --> 01:12:09.025
Okay, I've got a lot of work
left to do here,


869
01:12:09.112 --> 01:12:12.898
but I promise you,
we're gonna follow up on this.


870
01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:15.508
I'm not gonna close this case
until I'm 100% sure


871
01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.249
we have whoever did this

872
01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:19.731
and that you're safe.

873
01:12:23.691 --> 01:12:26.258
You have my word.

874
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.522
Thank you.

875
01:12:28.609 --> 01:12:30.002
Excuse me.

876
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:34.790
This is Greer.

877
01:12:34.877 --> 01:12:35.878
Detective Greer.

878
01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:41.186
Anton King from Escape Pads.

879
01:12:41.318 --> 01:12:44.668
Why were you at my property
last night?


880
01:12:46.017 --> 01:12:47.758
I'm afraid I don't.

881
01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:50.066
I can't help but think
that you have


882
01:12:50.153 --> 01:12:52.198
some kind of
personal vendetta against me


883
01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:55.811
because I wouldn't
bend over backwards for you.


884
01:12:55.941 --> 01:12:59.292
You know, I have
a lot of contacts


885
01:12:59.423 --> 01:13:02.426
and I don't want to file
a formal complaint against you


886
01:13:02.513 --> 01:13:04.079
for harassment.

887
01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:06.168
Are you at a loss for words?

888
01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:09.172
Enjoy this while you can,
Mr. King.


889
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:12.131
Again, I don't know
what you mean.


890
01:13:27.799 --> 01:13:29.365
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
share, share.


891
01:13:29.496 --> 01:13:31.977
Sebastian, get out of there!

892
01:13:32.064 --> 01:13:33.065
Let them eat.

893
01:13:33.152 --> 01:13:34.719
You've had enough.

894
01:13:41.073 --> 01:13:42.640
What's wrong with you?

895
01:13:42.727 --> 01:13:45.295
Nothing.

896
01:13:45.425 --> 01:13:49.820
They found Ms. Banks' attacker
this morning.


897
01:13:49.908 --> 01:13:52.128
Suicide.

898
01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:55.174
Her fiancé
followed her to the beach


899
01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:58.133
so we're off the hook
on this one.


900
01:13:58.221 --> 01:13:59.309
Whooo!

901
01:14:00.614 --> 01:14:01.789
Yup!

902
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.530
Textbook.

903
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:12.191
Are you sweating, Michael?

904
01:14:15.847 --> 01:14:17.370
I have to get some air.

905
01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:25.552
I'm sorry, Dani.

906
01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:28.555
No one should have
to go through all this.


907
01:14:28.642 --> 01:14:30.470
What a bastard.

908
01:14:30.557 --> 01:14:32.646
It wasn't Craig.

909
01:14:32.733 --> 01:14:35.258
Look, I know you still want
to see the best in him, but...


910
01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.608
It wasn't him.

911
01:14:39.001 --> 01:14:41.917
Look, I've got
a quick Zoom meeting,


912
01:14:42.004 --> 01:14:44.180
and then I'm all yours.

913
01:14:44.267 --> 01:14:46.008
So can I get you anything
right now?


914
01:14:46.095 --> 01:14:47.966
No, I'm okay.

915
01:14:48.052 --> 01:14:51.056
Thank you.

916
01:14:51.142 --> 01:14:54.190
Well, there's coffee upstairs,
too, if you need.


917
01:14:54.277 --> 01:14:55.887
I'm fine.

918
01:14:55.974 --> 01:14:57.715
Okay.

919
01:15:26.874 --> 01:15:29.442
Hi, I'm looking for Mike
or Michael


920
01:15:29.573 --> 01:15:31.531
with the security division.

921
01:15:31.618 --> 01:15:33.011
Hi, beautiful.

922
01:15:33.097 --> 01:15:35.318
Mike's not here right now.

923
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.977
Hey!

924
01:15:42.064 --> 01:15:44.414
They canceled my meeting.

925
01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:46.720
We need to go
to Hannah's office.


926
01:15:46.807 --> 01:15:48.157
Now.

927
01:15:56.034 --> 01:15:57.688
- That's it.
- This?


928
01:15:57.775 --> 01:15:59.907
That's the vacation house.

929
01:15:59.995 --> 01:16:02.258
So Laura Winter is dead.

930
01:16:02.345 --> 01:16:04.173
Anton owns the house?

931
01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:22.886
Whoa!

932
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:24.671
Not looking too good, Mike.

933
01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:25.890
I just needed to get some...

934
01:16:25.977 --> 01:16:28.501
Fresh air, right?

935
01:16:28.632 --> 01:16:30.373
You know what,
why don't we take a ride,


936
01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:35.030
and I'll make all your fresh air
worries disappear.


937
01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:37.858
No, it's okay.

938
01:16:37.945 --> 01:16:40.338
I think I should be all good
in just a bit.


939
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:43.299
Get in the car.

940
01:16:43.386 --> 01:16:47.999
Please, do not make me
repeat myself.


941
01:17:03.275 --> 01:17:04.407
Where are we going?

942
01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:06.104
It's a surprise.

943
01:17:06.191 --> 01:17:08.237
You like those, don't you?

944
01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.412
Uh...

945
01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.805
Not sure? Okay.

946
01:17:11.936 --> 01:17:14.112
How about privacy,
do you like that?


947
01:17:14.199 --> 01:17:17.681
'Cause I do.

948
01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:21.206
So answer me this, Mike.

949
01:17:21.293 --> 01:17:23.252
Laura Winters' property holdings

950
01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.644
on my computer?

951
01:17:24.731 --> 01:17:28.083
And why was Danielle Banks
calling you?


952
01:17:38.658 --> 01:17:41.444
Yes, thank you, Detective.

953
01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:47.014
They're gonna put you in a hotel
until they find him.


954
01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:48.842
An officer's gonna come
to pick you up,


955
01:17:48.929 --> 01:17:51.584
and he'll be guarding the lobby
once you're there.


956
01:17:51.715 --> 01:17:53.325
Just one?

957
01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:55.719
Yes, he's gonna be under
an assumed name.


958
01:17:55.806 --> 01:17:59.592
Plus I think he's too smart
to just walk into a local hotel


959
01:17:59.722 --> 01:18:01.811
as a wanted man, right?

960
01:18:04.423 --> 01:18:05.642
It'll be all right.

961
01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:11.300
Okay. Okay.

962
01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.215
So what can I do?

963
01:18:13.345 --> 01:18:16.174
You should pick up her stuff
from your place.


964
01:18:16.261 --> 01:18:19.221
Okay. Okay, I... 
I can do that.

965
01:18:19.308 --> 01:18:20.177
Where are your keys?

966
01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:21.484
Oh.

967
01:18:23.225 --> 01:18:25.140
Okay, I'll be back soon.

968
01:18:25.227 --> 01:18:26.924
Thank you!

969
01:18:29.144 --> 01:18:31.363
I can get out of your hair
if you need to work.


970
01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:33.539
Oh, no, I'm fine.

971
01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:35.628
But I think
you should get some rest.


972
01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:37.891
There's a suite for you
if you want.


973
01:18:38.022 --> 01:18:39.415
Yeah, that sounds good.

974
01:18:39.502 --> 01:18:41.329
Come on, I'll show you.

975
01:18:44.463 --> 01:18:45.682
Mike, check this out.

976
01:18:45.811 --> 01:18:47.423
The tracker on her car
is working.


977
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:49.990
Oh, you don't care.

978
01:18:50.077 --> 01:18:52.036
Here she comes.

979
01:18:52.123 --> 01:18:53.646
I see you.

980
01:19:00.305 --> 01:19:01.915
I'm on my way now.

981
01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.833
This is gonna be fun.

982
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:36.733
All right, I'm gonna be
one second, Mike.


983
01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:40.737
You just hang tight, all right?

984
01:19:40.824 --> 01:19:43.043
All right.

985
01:19:59.277 --> 01:20:00.713
Shut up! Shut up!

986
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.932
Come here!

987
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:05.240
Shh, shh, shh!

988
01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:22.909
Where are you, girl?

989
01:20:28.088 --> 01:20:29.133
Hey!

990
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.352
Hi, beautiful.

991
01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:34.225
What have you done to her?

992
01:20:34.356 --> 01:20:36.096
She's just fine!

993
01:20:42.146 --> 01:20:46.106
And she will stay that way
if you do what I say.


994
01:20:46.193 --> 01:20:50.110
I want you to come meet me
by yourself.


995
01:20:50.197 --> 01:20:54.376
If I see you with anyone else,
especially the police,


996
01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:56.856
I will do to your friend here
what I did to the others,


997
01:20:56.987 --> 01:20:59.685
you understand?

998
01:20:59.816 --> 01:21:01.338
Where?

999
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.775
Where we had our first date,
silly.


1000
01:21:03.863 --> 01:21:08.302
Now, hurry up,
because I might get bored


1001
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:09.999
and use your friend as...

1002
01:21:12.394 --> 01:21:14.265
entertainment.

1003
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:26.016
Hey, hey.

1004
01:21:28.365 --> 01:21:29.933
Hey, hey, hey, shh, shh!

1005
01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.022
Relax.

1006
01:21:32.109 --> 01:21:33.632
As long as you stay
nice and quiet,


1007
01:21:33.719 --> 01:21:36.461
I have no reason to hurt you.

1008
01:21:36.548 --> 01:21:39.551
You've done nothing wrong,
as far as I know.


1009
01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:41.727
Unlike your friend.

1010
01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.599
Breaking her vows.

1011
01:21:43.686 --> 01:21:45.383
Okay?

1012
01:21:46.775 --> 01:21:48.472
Good girl.

1013
01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:04.749
Anton?

1014
01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.100
I'm here.

1015
01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:09.494
Alone.

1016
01:22:11.017 --> 01:22:12.017
Get up.

1017
01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.499
Okay, it's all right, shh.

1018
01:22:18.677 --> 01:22:21.332
So nice of you to join us.

1019
01:22:22.463 --> 01:22:24.074
Not quite yet.

1020
01:22:24.204 --> 01:22:25.597
I'm the one you want.

1021
01:22:25.728 --> 01:22:28.338
Let her go.

1022
01:22:28.426 --> 01:22:30.733
She gets to watch.

1023
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:34.911
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.


1024
01:22:34.998 --> 01:22:38.305
Not if I don't have to.

1025
01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:40.699
You should've been
more committed to your husband.


1026
01:22:40.829 --> 01:22:43.789
But instead, you come here
and celebrate your divorce


1027
01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.051
with your friends?

1028
01:22:45.182 --> 01:22:46.923
Why do you care?

1029
01:22:47.052 --> 01:22:48.664
I see it all the time.

1030
01:22:48.793 --> 01:22:53.320
You women on your vacations
thinking you can just escape


1031
01:22:53.408 --> 01:22:55.105
from your responsibilities.

1032
01:22:55.235 --> 01:22:56.933
"Oh, I'm searching
for the new me


1033
01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.413
so I can be free!"

1034
01:22:59.805 --> 01:23:02.852
But you, you took it
a step further


1035
01:23:02.939 --> 01:23:06.029
with your adultery.

1036
01:23:06.115 --> 01:23:09.336
You made yourself a target.

1037
01:23:09.424 --> 01:23:12.514
Now you need to be punished.

1038
01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:14.100
And you have the right
to determine that?


1039
01:23:14.124 --> 01:23:17.213
Right? No.

1040
01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:19.042
It's not my right.

1041
01:23:19.172 --> 01:23:20.609
It's my burden.

1042
01:23:22.611 --> 01:23:23.873
Ah!

1043
01:23:25.874 --> 01:23:27.790
- Are you okay?
- Mhm.


1044
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.574
Okay, take my phone.

1045
01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:33.622
You need to go to the bedroom
and lock yourself in.


1046
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:35.101
Danielle,
I'm not gonna leave you!


1047
01:23:35.188 --> 01:23:36.407
Just go, trust me!

1048
01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:38.931
Danielle! Danielle!

1049
01:23:39.017 --> 01:23:40.758
Danielle!

1050
01:24:00.039 --> 01:24:02.258
Danielle!

1051
01:24:02.346 --> 01:24:06.176
Ah, there's no place to hide!

1052
01:24:06.306 --> 01:24:08.439
I know this place
inside and out.


1053
01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:22.540
Ah!

1054
01:24:32.289 --> 01:24:34.291
Where do you think
you're going, huh?


1055
01:24:34.378 --> 01:24:35.858
Where do you think you're going?

1056
01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:37.033
You're not going anywhere.

1057
01:24:46.695 --> 01:24:48.914
I'm gonna kill you.

1058
01:24:49.045 --> 01:24:50.525
Dani!

1059
01:25:03.146 --> 01:25:04.016
Are you okay?

1060
01:25:04.103 --> 01:25:05.278
Yeah.

1061
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.195
It's over.

1062
01:25:09.282 --> 01:25:11.067
Oh, my God.

1063
01:25:17.377 --> 01:25:19.031
Oh, my God.

1064
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:29.258
Wow, this really makes it
feel real.


1065
01:25:32.262 --> 01:25:34.917
I just want to leave
all of this behind me.


1066
01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:36.527
Okay, well,
as soon as you get settled,


1067
01:25:36.658 --> 01:25:39.311
we are gonna go
on a proper vacation


1068
01:25:39.399 --> 01:25:42.707
at a five star hotel on me.

1069
01:25:42.793 --> 01:25:43.793
I'll drink to that.

1070
01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.405
- Okay.
- Wine?


1071
01:25:45.492 --> 01:25:46.275
A bottle of champagne!

1072
01:25:46.363 --> 01:25:48.060
- Oh!
- Champagne.


1073
01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:50.758
- Champagne it is.
- Yes!


1074
01:25:50.889 --> 01:25:52.935
Let's go plan it,
where should we go?


1075
01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:56.242
- Bora Bora!
- Ooh, I like that!
