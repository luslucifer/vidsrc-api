1
00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:57.245
You know,
bakeries are dangerous places.


2
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.380
Flour is flammable,
you know that, right?


3
00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:03.425
They've got these
particles


4
00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.123
that kind of float
all over a room.


5
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.603
I mean, just one of them
catches fire,


6
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:08.953
the whole place just kind of

7
00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:11.999
goes up like a tinderbox.

8
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.187
I got it.

9
00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:37.329
The boredom is a killer,
you know?


10
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.723
Aren't you bored?

11
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.335
Uh, yeah, at first,

12
00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:47.339
but, uh...

13
00:01:47.382 --> 00:01:50.777
I had enough good times.

14
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.736
So you're content with being
some fucking robot?


15
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.217
'Cause I'm not.

16
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.828
Can't do this much longer.

17
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.134
I guess what you've been doing
up to this point


18
00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:01.962
has been working out
so well, huh?


19
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:03.834
See, even that.

20
00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:06.575
You sound
like a fucking robot.


21
00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.579
99 out of 100 of you guys
will say that same exact shit.


22
00:02:10.623 --> 00:02:12.983
And the other guy would say
"You're sitting here getting fat


23
00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.975
while your disease is out back
doing push-ups."


24
00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.021
Yo, it's not funny.

25
00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:21.416
Okay.

26
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.985
I gotta go.
You cover this?


27
00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.031
- I got you next time?
- Yeah, sure.


28
00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:31.296
Hey, you call me
if you need me.


29
00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.341
Yeah.

30
00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:12.641
Hi, everybody.
My name is Isabel.


31
00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:14.252
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

32
00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:16.341
Hi, Isabel.

33
00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.344
And I've been in and out
of these rooms for years.


34
00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:22.347
Until I finally had the guts
to tell my sponsor


35
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.350
what made me wanna get sober
in the first place.


36
00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:30.355
I killed someone.

37
00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.574
I was driving home
and I hit a guy.


38
00:03:32.618 --> 00:03:35.490
And I was so loaded
I didn't even slow down.


39
00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:38.276
I drove home waiting for the
police to show up at the door


40
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.625
and they never did.

41
00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:43.629
My sponsor told me
what I had to do.


42
00:03:43.672 --> 00:03:46.371
I had to turn myself in

43
00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.373
and make amends to his family.

44
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:49.983
And she told me this,

45
00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:51.985
"His family may never
forgive you,


46
00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:53.987
and you will go to prison,

47
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:55.989
but you'll have some of us
out here


48
00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:57.860
and you'll have some of us
in there.


49
00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:02.039
'Cause out here with all
the lies and the guilt,


50
00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:05.085
you'll be less free
than you'll be in there."


51
00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:16.531
We're years out,

52
00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:19.534
but my guys think they have
isolated a cluster of cells


53
00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:22.233
that can be built
into a filter.


54
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:26.889
Salt water goes in and
fresh water comes out.


55
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.328
What about the resulting
overpopulation?


56
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.287
Problems ascribed to
overpopulation are...


57
00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:35.289
political contrivances.

58
00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.291
Misbehavior of power.

59
00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:39.641
You know that.

60
00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:42.993
You know, John, for one
of the richest guys I know,


61
00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:45.299
you sound an awful lot
like a communist.


62
00:04:45.343 --> 00:04:47.301
According to the internet,

63
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:50.304
you're one of the richest guys
anybody knows,


64
00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:53.307
but every time we talk
about overpopulation,


65
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:55.353
you sound like an asshole.

66
00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:57.572
Remind me again,
what's the internet?


67
00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:00.073
Oh, come on, Max, don't pretend
like you're an old fart, all right?


68
00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:01.533
I know you better than this.

69
00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.187
Nick, do me a favor.

70
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.189
In the future, in say
ten years from now,


71
00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:07.191
you ever catch me bragging

72
00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:11.108
that I had dinner
with John Ives, shoot me.


73
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:14.111
You know, Max,

74
00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:15.851
I'll do you a favor

75
00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.636
and I'll shoot you myself.

76
00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:23.076
Well, you impressed me
at least.


77
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.644
Well, that's because
you are a communist.


78
00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:27.211
Oh, very funny.

79
00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:29.430
Max may look
like a "Bond" villain,


80
00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:31.998
but he's got a good heart
and I think you made your point.


81
00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:35.001
You ready to go home, Red?

82
00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:37.003
Let's get outta here.

83
00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:39.005
Now?

84
00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:40.528
Yeah, Maria's gotta go
to sleep.


85
00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:43.879
Maria, put Ethan
to bed long ago.


86
00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:46.882
And right now she's falling
asleep in front of the TV.


87
00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:48.145
You're gonna dance with me.

88
00:05:48.188 --> 00:05:50.147
I'm gonna...

89
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.800
- I'm gonna dance with you?
- Mm-hmm.


90
00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:34.147
Selene.

91
00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:28.506
There's a Mrs. Ives
to see you.


92
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.725
Mrs. Ives.

93
00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:32.771
She's in conference
room three.


94
00:07:35.774 --> 00:07:38.733
- Tell her I'll be there in ten minutes.
- Okay.


95
00:08:05.064 --> 00:08:07.675
You know, I...

96
00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:09.851
I read about your son,

97
00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:12.376
and I'm sorry for your loss.

98
00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:17.207
Thank you.

99
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.210
It's been hard on John.

100
00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:22.255
How have you been?

101
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.703
I miss him so much.

102
00:08:38.793 --> 00:08:40.273
I'd give...

103
00:08:40.317 --> 00:08:42.319
I'd give anything
to have him back.


104
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.324
But I know that's crazy,
isn't it?


105
00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:53.330
No.

106
00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:56.855
I don't think that's crazy.

107
00:08:56.898 --> 00:08:59.901
I know why you're here.

108
00:09:02.382 --> 00:09:05.385
It is possible.

109
00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:15.439
The answer is yes.

110
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:24.665
They cloned a sheep.

111
00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:26.972
You're talking
about a human being.


112
00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:31.542
All he needs is Ethan's DNA.

113
00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:46.296
We can finally
move on, John.


114
00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:02.181
This isn't moving on.

115
00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:06.446
He can bring Ethan back.

116
00:10:08.492 --> 00:10:11.103
The technology is there,
John.


117
00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:14.149
He can clone him.

118
00:10:36.998 --> 00:10:39.784
No.

119
00:10:39.827 --> 00:10:42.830
I can't.

120
00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:51.448
You don't have to.

121
00:10:56.366 --> 00:10:58.324
- I'm sorry.
- I can't.


122
00:10:58.368 --> 00:11:00.370
I can't.

123
00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:58.009
Sit down.

124
00:12:58.052 --> 00:13:01.055
Look at me.

125
00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.024
Come to my room.

126
00:13:13.067 --> 00:13:15.635
I'll let you touch.

127
00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:18.105
Fuck!

128
00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.325
You fuck!

129
00:15:20.368 --> 00:15:23.328
Get the fuck...

130
00:18:44.921 --> 00:18:47.924
What happens when Nick starts
to look like Ethan?


131
00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:50.970
What are we going
to tell people?


132
00:18:53.407 --> 00:18:56.846
The same parents,
kids are gonna look alike.


133
00:19:00.414 --> 00:19:03.374
Nick uses his right hand.

134
00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:05.376
So what?

135
00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:08.379
Ethan used his left.

136
00:19:08.422 --> 00:19:10.816
Hon...

137
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.687
he's a baby.

138
00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:13.950
How can you tell?

139
00:19:13.993 --> 00:19:15.952
Because I'm with him
all day.


140
00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:17.997
I know.

141
00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.570
Maybe you should talk
to someone.


142
00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:30.618
No, I... I can't talk
to anybody about this.


143
00:19:30.662 --> 00:19:33.404
I don't mean about this.

144
00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:36.494
I mean...
about how you're feeling.


145
00:19:39.236 --> 00:19:42.239
Don't diminish
what I'm feeling, John.


146
00:19:43.457 --> 00:19:45.416
I'm not, okay?

147
00:19:45.459 --> 00:19:48.245
I'm sorry.

148
00:19:48.288 --> 00:19:51.248
Hey.

149
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.946
I just hate seeing you
like this.


150
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.993
I was lost, Selene.

151
00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:00.431
And you pulled me back.

152
00:20:00.474 --> 00:20:03.477
You saved my life.

153
00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:09.396
There's nothing in the world
I wouldn't do for you.


154
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.485
Or Nick.

155
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.925
I love you.

156
00:20:15.968 --> 00:20:18.928
I love Nick.

157
00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:20.930
I was in the supermarket the other day

158
00:20:20.973 --> 00:20:22.932
and there was this piece
of fruit


159
00:20:22.975 --> 00:20:26.936
that had fallen off the stand

160
00:20:26.979 --> 00:20:30.940
and it was just there
on the floor all by itself


161
00:20:30.983 --> 00:20:33.943
and I started to cry.

162
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.598
I don't know, there was just
something about it


163
00:20:37.642 --> 00:20:39.992
that was incredibly sad.

164
00:20:40.036 --> 00:20:42.995
What do you think it was
that made you cry?


165
00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.606
I don't know.

166
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.653
I mean, I guess I do know.

167
00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:53.310
But I can't talk about it.

168
00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.965
Okay.

169
00:20:57.053 --> 00:21:00.230
How are things with John?

170
00:21:01.274 --> 00:21:03.798
Things with John are good.

171
00:21:04.843 --> 00:21:06.627
I got home from the market

172
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.674
and John was there
and he was great.


173
00:21:09.717 --> 00:21:13.069
I promise
I will man the fort 24-7.


174
00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:17.116
He really works hard
to make me feel better.


175
00:21:18.422 --> 00:21:20.380
He's happy.

176
00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:22.382
He seems happy.

177
00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:25.429
He acts happy.

178
00:21:29.302 --> 00:21:34.046
The other day I looked
through a box of Ethan's stuff.

179
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.746
I found his baby teeth
and I took them to the park.


180
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.270
I don't even know why.

181
00:21:40.313 --> 00:21:43.273
I guess I just wanted him
close to me.


182
00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:45.710
Hey, girl.

183
00:21:45.753 --> 00:21:48.234
How've you been?

184
00:21:48.278 --> 00:21:51.237
Let me ask you something.

185
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.023
Do you think Nick
looks like Ethan?


186
00:21:56.764 --> 00:22:01.334
Well, um... no.

187
00:22:01.378 --> 00:22:04.381
I don't.

188
00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:15.696
You know when you walk
into a spider web


189
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.439
and you freak out and you're
pulling it off of you,


190
00:22:19.483 --> 00:22:21.833
but it's so thin and silky?

191
00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:23.400
And you can't feel it anymore,

192
00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:26.968
but you know it's all over
your body.


193
00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.014
I feel like that.

194
00:22:29.058 --> 00:22:31.277
But there's no web.

195
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:34.324
No spider.

196
00:22:34.367 --> 00:22:37.196
It's Nick.

197
00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.995
John!

198
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.041
What are you doing?

199
00:22:59.088 --> 00:23:00.872
Oh, God.

200
00:23:00.915 --> 00:23:03.135
John, his diaper
is soaking wet.


201
00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:11.056
I need to know
what he's doing.


202
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.146
I need to know what he's doing
when I'm not there.


203
00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:20.848
Who are you talking about,
John or Nick?


204
00:23:24.504 --> 00:23:27.203
Everything is like something.

205
00:23:29.248 --> 00:23:31.468
I said it's like a spider web.

206
00:23:33.513 --> 00:23:35.472
But it's not.

207
00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:39.040
It's...

208
00:23:44.481 --> 00:23:46.874
Your body has changed since carrying Ethan.

209
00:23:46.918 --> 00:23:50.008
Environmental conditions
play a major factor


210
00:23:50.051 --> 00:23:52.131
- in the development of the baby.
- Oh, God, bullshit!


211
00:23:55.709 --> 00:23:58.712
I just want to know
if they're the same person.


212
00:24:05.719 --> 00:24:07.156
They are.

213
00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:09.549
How do you know?

214
00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:13.553
Because Shepard tested
the blood, the hair...


215
00:24:13.597 --> 00:24:15.207
I don't believe him, John.

216
00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:18.210
He's got his fingerprints.

217
00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:28.307
You have Ethan's
fingerprints?


218
00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:32.920
I wanna see.

219
00:24:32.964 --> 00:24:35.923
I gave Shepard everything
from the crime scene.


220
00:24:35.967 --> 00:24:38.926
I don't have them,
he has them.


221
00:24:41.494 --> 00:24:43.801
You know something's wrong.

222
00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:49.241
You act happy and pretend
that everything is normal,


223
00:24:49.285 --> 00:24:52.070
but I've seen the way
you look at Nick.


224
00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:54.638
You spend every day and night
in your office


225
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:56.248
because you don't wanna admit

226
00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:59.251
what's really going on
in our lives.


227
00:24:59.295 --> 00:25:01.427
You know.

228
00:25:01.471 --> 00:25:03.647
I know you know.

229
00:25:07.738 --> 00:25:09.740
What do I know?

230
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.092
That Nick is not our son.

231
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.188
Then who is he?

232
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.272
Oh.

233
00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:20.174
After we made our agreement,

234
00:27:20.218 --> 00:27:23.177
John gave me the sample.

235
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:27.791
But very quickly
I knew it wasn't your son.


236
00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:30.794
But he gave me a choice:

237
00:27:30.837 --> 00:27:33.405
you can work with this sample,

238
00:27:33.449 --> 00:27:36.930
you can clone this sample,

239
00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:39.759
or you can walk away.

240
00:27:39.803 --> 00:27:43.589
He assured me that he would
produce the true donor


241
00:27:43.633 --> 00:27:46.244
of the sample at a later date,

242
00:27:46.287 --> 00:27:49.856
and he said that he would
explain everything to you


243
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.816
and that you would
be okay with it.


244
00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:54.861
He promised me that.

245
00:27:54.905 --> 00:27:57.473
I had to believe him.

246
00:27:57.516 --> 00:28:00.476
I needed to believe him.

247
00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:03.479
This work...

248
00:28:03.522 --> 00:28:06.395
I felt it had to be done.

249
00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:10.007
We were never gonna get Ethan.

250
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.053
At the very least,
we could get the killer.


251
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:22.585
What is...
What is this?


252
00:28:22.628 --> 00:28:24.630
This is Nick.

253
00:28:24.674 --> 00:28:28.112
And this is a man
that John fired.


254
00:28:29.853 --> 00:28:31.507
This is John's uncle.

255
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.553
He was caught embezzling,
stealing from the company.


256
00:28:36.337 --> 00:28:38.209
He's comparing
facial features


257
00:28:38.252 --> 00:28:40.907
between Nick and all
of these people.


258
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:42.387
John didn't lie to you

259
00:28:42.431 --> 00:28:45.216
when he said the sample came
from the crime scene.


260
00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:48.611
But it wasn't Ethan's DNA.

261
00:28:48.654 --> 00:28:51.222
It's the killer's DNA.

262
00:28:51.265 --> 00:28:55.618
My son, the boy you put
in my body,


263
00:28:55.661 --> 00:28:58.577
will reveal who killed Ethan.

264
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:02.799
The face of my baby
is the face


265
00:29:02.842 --> 00:29:04.844
of the man
who killed Ethan.


266
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:10.589
You pushed me into it.

267
00:29:14.288 --> 00:29:17.378
My father's picture was in your files.

268
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:24.690
Do you think
my father did this?


269
00:29:24.734 --> 00:29:27.301
Am I married to a man

270
00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:30.522
who thinks that my father
could murder his own grandson?


271
00:29:32.568 --> 00:29:35.527
Are you so weak

272
00:29:35.571 --> 00:29:39.183
that you have to believe
there was a reason?


273
00:29:39.226 --> 00:29:42.229
There's never any reason, John.

274
00:29:47.626 --> 00:29:51.021
Ethan's death was
not something


275
00:29:51.064 --> 00:29:54.024
that was natural
or unnatural.


276
00:29:54.067 --> 00:29:58.071
It was just something
that happened.


277
00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:07.428
But Nick...

278
00:30:11.868 --> 00:30:14.871
what is he?

279
00:30:17.047 --> 00:30:21.051
What you did was unnatural,
John.


280
00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:25.011
And he...

281
00:30:25.055 --> 00:30:28.232
he is not natural.

282
00:32:46.587 --> 00:32:49.590
Mr. and Mrs. Ives.

283
00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.116
My name is Dean Ruster.

284
00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:57.337
I'm the man
who murdered your son.


285
00:33:00.384 --> 00:33:03.387
Nothing I can ever do
can set things right.


286
00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:08.305
I'm writing this letter
in an attempt


287
00:33:08.348 --> 00:33:10.742
to make amends to both of you

288
00:33:10.786 --> 00:33:14.572
and to allow you some peace.

289
00:33:19.577 --> 00:33:23.146
What I want you to know is
that I've made the decision


290
00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:27.193
to turn myself into the police
and accept the punishment.


291
00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:38.465
Part of the process of making
amends is to ask for forgiveness


292
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:41.512
but what I've done is
beyond forgiveness.


293
00:33:43.557 --> 00:33:46.125
I could try and explain
who I was


294
00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:48.301
and where I was in my life
back then,


295
00:33:48.345 --> 00:33:51.740
but I know that there could
never ever be any excuse


296
00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:54.743
for what I've done.

297
00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.272
I know I'll never get a chance
to speak to you in person,


298
00:34:02.315 --> 00:34:06.189
so this is my only chance
to speak to you directly.


299
00:34:06.232 --> 00:34:09.670
I hope that knowing the truth
about what happened to your son

300
00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:13.674
and knowing that the man
who did it will be punished


301
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:17.504
will bring some kind of peace.

302
00:34:18.549 --> 00:34:20.812
God bless.

303
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.246
Nick!

304
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.293
Nick, now!

305
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:21.019
God grant me the serenity

306
00:36:21.063 --> 00:36:23.021
to accept the things
I cannot change.


307
00:36:23.065 --> 00:36:25.458
Courage to change
the things I can


308
00:36:25.502 --> 00:36:27.286
and wisdom to know
the difference.


309
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.811
Keep coming back,
it works if you work it.


310
00:36:47.437 --> 00:36:51.093
This is West 8th Street,
New York Aquarium.


311
00:36:51.136 --> 00:36:53.530
Transfer is available
to the Q train.


312
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.586
You expecting a phone call
or something?


313
00:37:08.632 --> 00:37:11.200
Put the fucking phone away.

314
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.242
You're... you're a cop.

315
00:37:53.285 --> 00:37:55.984
No.

316
00:37:58.029 --> 00:38:00.075
A lawyer?

317
00:38:00.118 --> 00:38:02.077
Oh, God, no.

318
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.080
No, I'm a friend of Mrs. Ives.

319
00:38:05.123 --> 00:38:07.952
Dean.

320
00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:10.346
I know who you are.

321
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:14.393
And I... I know
what you've done.


322
00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:21.183
The Ives have a son.

323
00:38:21.226 --> 00:38:24.186
Nick. He's gonna
be 12 years old.


324
00:38:24.229 --> 00:38:26.405
And as crazy
as it sounds...


325
00:39:53.971 --> 00:39:55.929
How old are you, Dean?

326
00:39:55.973 --> 00:39:57.235
35.

327
00:39:57.279 --> 00:40:00.891
Have you ever had any
major illnesses?


328
00:40:00.934 --> 00:40:02.501
No.

329
00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:03.763
Surgeries?

330
00:40:03.807 --> 00:40:05.765
No.

331
00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:07.985
Have you broken
any bones?


332
00:40:08.028 --> 00:40:10.988
Yes. Many.

333
00:40:11.031 --> 00:40:13.425
Siblings?

334
00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:16.428
Dean?

335
00:40:16.472 --> 00:40:19.431
Are you okay?

336
00:40:19.475 --> 00:40:22.130
Have some juice.

337
00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.062
Are you good?

338
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.108
Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.245
Are you troubled
by feelings of guilt?


340
00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:51.985
No.

341
00:40:52.029 --> 00:40:55.206
Have you ever experienced
a deep emotional connection


342
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.208
with another person?

343
00:40:57.252 --> 00:40:59.210
No.

344
00:40:59.254 --> 00:41:01.212
Yes.

345
00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:04.259
Uh, not in the way
you're asking.


346
00:41:05.912 --> 00:41:08.350
The boy... is... is there
something wrong with the boy?


347
00:41:09.394 --> 00:41:11.570
The boy's fine.

348
00:41:11.614 --> 00:41:13.746
So, these... these questions...

349
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.488
Is this, um... Is this a nature
nurture thing?


350
00:41:16.532 --> 00:41:19.535
It's not...
It's not one thing.


351
00:41:21.537 --> 00:41:23.495
May I go on?

352
00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:26.106
Yeah.

353
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.501
Do you feel the world
exists solely for you?


354
00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:32.504
Hmm.

355
00:41:32.548 --> 00:41:35.507
I remember...

356
00:41:35.551 --> 00:41:37.248
going to bed at night

357
00:41:37.292 --> 00:41:41.252
and I knew that the world
collapsed when I was asleep.


358
00:41:43.298 --> 00:41:45.909
And then when I woke up,

359
00:41:45.952 --> 00:41:49.913
it had reassembled itself.

360
00:41:49.956 --> 00:41:51.349
What's going on here?

361
00:41:51.393 --> 00:41:52.698
What do you mean?

362
00:41:52.742 --> 00:41:55.701
This isn't...

363
00:41:55.745 --> 00:41:58.313
This is not what I expected.

364
00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:01.185
I was...

365
00:42:01.229 --> 00:42:03.187
I thought I'd be crucified,

366
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:07.235
but instead I'm getting a
blood test, orange juice.


367
00:42:10.716 --> 00:42:13.676
There's a part of me
that welcomes it.


368
00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:16.200
The survival part,

369
00:42:16.244 --> 00:42:19.072
but the...
the moral part...


370
00:42:21.118 --> 00:42:25.078
I want to see him.

371
00:42:25.122 --> 00:42:27.385
You seem like
a reasonable guy, Dean,


372
00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:30.910
but you're gonna have to wait.

373
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.699
Yeah.

374
00:44:41.258 --> 00:44:42.259
Nick.

375
00:44:45.393 --> 00:44:47.395
Nick.

376
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.622
Mom?

377
00:44:57.666 --> 00:44:59.711
Hey.

378
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:21.124
Mom, what are you doing?

379
00:45:32.744 --> 00:45:36.008
You're freaking me out, mom.

380
00:45:48.368 --> 00:45:50.719
I'm gonna go to bed now.

381
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.232
This is Dean.

382
00:46:26.276 --> 00:46:27.538
Leave a message.

383
00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:33.849
This is Selene Ives.

384
00:46:33.892 --> 00:46:36.852
I'd like to come
and talk to you.


385
00:46:36.895 --> 00:46:39.419
Give me a call back
with your address.


386
00:46:59.831 --> 00:47:01.224
None for you?

387
00:47:01.267 --> 00:47:03.269
Oh, not now.

388
00:47:27.555 --> 00:47:29.557
This is very good.

389
00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:53.972
I've been trying
to locate the...


390
00:47:56.975 --> 00:47:59.978
the nanny's family.

391
00:48:03.503 --> 00:48:06.506
I... I want to speak
with them.


392
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:12.295
But...
well, I can't find anything.


393
00:48:14.689 --> 00:48:17.692
She didn't have any family.

394
00:48:18.736 --> 00:48:20.695
No kids.

395
00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:22.740
Her parents were both dead.

396
00:48:25.917 --> 00:48:28.877
She divorced her husband
and moved from Guatemala.


397
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.922
She had no one.

398
00:48:40.932 --> 00:48:42.891
What was her name?

399
00:48:42.934 --> 00:48:44.936
Maria.

400
00:48:46.634 --> 00:48:49.593
We buried her.

401
00:48:49.637 --> 00:48:51.900
I contacted some of her friends
from Guatemala,


402
00:48:51.943 --> 00:48:54.554
but no one came.

403
00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.600
It was just us.

404
00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:51.524
What?

405
00:50:05.713 --> 00:50:07.976
Ah! Ow.

406
00:50:32.304 --> 00:50:36.134
John wanted to hate Nick.

407
00:50:36.178 --> 00:50:39.921
But he was so helpless
and so small,


408
00:50:39.964 --> 00:50:42.097
so we raised Nick
as our own.


409
00:50:43.272 --> 00:50:46.188
What's he like?

410
00:50:46.231 --> 00:50:48.886
Nick?

411
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:50.366
Nick doesn't have that scar.

412
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.765
What's it from?

413
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.680
Blood brothers.

414
00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.900
Are you still in touch
with your blood brother?


415
00:51:02.944 --> 00:51:04.728
No.

416
00:51:06.425 --> 00:51:09.777
There was more blood
there than brother.


417
00:51:14.912 --> 00:51:20.526
Five years ago,
I first decided to contact you,


418
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.877
and by the grace of God...

419
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:27.359
and whatever moral sense
I still had,


420
00:51:27.403 --> 00:51:31.102
I knew I had to confess.

421
00:51:31.146 --> 00:51:34.236
To give you closure.

422
00:51:34.279 --> 00:51:37.195
When I finally
found you and John...


423
00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:41.373
I couldn't.

424
00:51:43.854 --> 00:51:45.813
I was a coward.

425
00:51:49.294 --> 00:51:53.733
I felt so alone
back then.


426
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:55.997
I was a different person.

427
00:51:58.564 --> 00:52:01.654
No.
It was me.


428
00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.660
I did these things.

429
00:52:07.704 --> 00:52:10.925
To you.
To your husband.


430
00:52:10.968 --> 00:52:13.928
To your nanny.

431
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:16.234
To your son.

432
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.330
Tell me.

433
00:52:25.374 --> 00:52:27.855
I need to know.

434
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:38.517
That day...

435
00:52:38.561 --> 00:52:42.217
I'd fallen asleep
on a train.


436
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.569
And I woke
in Coney Island.


437
00:52:46.612 --> 00:52:51.313
It was so hot,
I swam in the ocean.


438
00:52:51.356 --> 00:52:52.923
Dried out in the sun.

439
00:52:54.751 --> 00:52:58.537
Then I was back
on the train.


440
00:52:58.581 --> 00:53:02.280
And then
I was somewhere else.


441
00:53:02.324 --> 00:53:05.893
The streets were tree-lined,
big houses.


442
00:53:17.252 --> 00:53:20.298
She woke up
and saw me standing there.


443
00:53:23.606 --> 00:53:26.435
She asked what I wanted.

444
00:53:26.478 --> 00:53:29.264
And... and I hit her.

445
00:53:31.222 --> 00:53:34.530
I don't know
what I wanted.


446
00:53:34.573 --> 00:53:39.013
I wasn't there
'cause I wanted anything.


447
00:53:39.056 --> 00:53:44.018
But once I started,
I couldn't stop.


448
00:53:47.195 --> 00:53:49.327
And then I saw him.

449
00:53:49.371 --> 00:53:51.590
He just stood there.

450
00:53:55.855 --> 00:53:59.642
He closed the door behind him,
but it wasn't locked.


451
00:54:05.953 --> 00:54:07.955
Sorry.

452
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.656
Tell me.

453
00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:15.440
I need to hear it.

454
00:54:22.795 --> 00:54:26.625
He was crying, but calm.

455
00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:33.328
It was as if he had accepted
what was happening.


456
00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:36.940
So I walked him
down the hall


457
00:54:36.984 --> 00:54:40.639
and he tried to bite me.

458
00:54:40.683 --> 00:54:42.902
He didn't hurt me.

459
00:54:46.341 --> 00:54:49.300
I threw him down
and he hit his head


460
00:54:49.344 --> 00:54:52.390
on the corner
of the television stand.


461
00:54:56.307 --> 00:55:00.746
He tried to crawl away,
but his...


462
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:05.795
he couldn't get his arms and legs
to work the way that he wanted.


463
00:55:08.363 --> 00:55:12.106
And then he stopped moving.

464
00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:14.325
And then
he stopped breathing.


465
00:55:18.329 --> 00:55:22.681
I looked around the house. I was there,
so I figured I should steal something.


466
00:55:22.725 --> 00:55:24.118
But...

467
00:55:26.903 --> 00:55:29.514
there was nothing for me.

468
00:55:32.256 --> 00:55:35.085
I couldn't remember everything
that had happened, but...


469
00:55:39.263 --> 00:55:40.917
I felt it.

470
00:55:49.447 --> 00:55:51.797
I'm turning myself in.

471
00:55:54.757 --> 00:55:56.933
I shoulda done it long ago.

472
00:56:22.654 --> 00:56:23.916
Hey, it's getting late.

473
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.440
I haven't heard from you
all night.


474
00:56:25.483 --> 00:56:27.442
Give me a ring, okay?

475
00:56:31.185 --> 00:56:34.536
All right,
it's bedtime, bud.


476
00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:36.146
Nick.

477
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.106
Yeah?

478
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:45.851
How long's it take
before you finish that thing?


479
00:56:45.895 --> 00:56:48.115
However long it takes.

480
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:53.946
All right, get to bed.

481
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:57.254
One second.

482
00:57:03.565 --> 00:57:06.045
Nick, now. Go.

483
00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:30.722
- Hey.
- Hey.


484
00:57:30.766 --> 00:57:32.420
How's Jeannie?

485
00:57:34.552 --> 00:57:38.034
She's fine.
She's good.


486
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.998
It's late. I left you
a couple messages.


487
00:57:49.176 --> 00:57:51.090
I left my phone
in the car.


488
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.571
I'm gonna
take a shower.


489
00:57:53.615 --> 00:57:54.616
Hey.

490
00:57:57.358 --> 00:57:59.969
Come here.

491
00:58:00.012 --> 00:58:02.450
John, I'm so tired.

492
00:58:02.493 --> 00:58:04.495
Come here.

493
00:58:29.738 --> 00:58:32.436
I miss you.

494
00:58:38.094 --> 00:58:39.835
I love you.

495
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.277
I love you.

496
00:59:02.553 --> 00:59:04.860
I'm gonna go take a shower.

497
01:00:50.879 --> 01:00:53.229
...what might happen in our lives,

498
01:00:53.272 --> 01:00:55.623
we'll be able to move closer
to the idea


499
01:00:55.666 --> 01:00:57.973
we've been trying to prove.

500
01:01:23.607 --> 01:01:26.088
...conscious contact with God,

501
01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:29.657
with His grace,
wisdom, and love.


502
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.401
And always remember that
meditation is in reality...


503
01:03:00.356 --> 01:03:03.838
Father,
it's been a long time,


504
01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:08.146
and I miss you.

505
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:12.586
I wonder how you are,
where you are,


506
01:03:12.629 --> 01:03:14.631
if I'll ever see you again.

507
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.552
I bought land
in the mountains.


508
01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:27.252
Acres and acres
of empty canvas.


509
01:03:32.388 --> 01:03:37.436
But I've been staring so long
into the forest...


510
01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.790
I feel like the forest has
started to stare back into me.


511
01:04:40.456 --> 01:04:42.632
Hey!

512
01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.251
Hey!

513
01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:02.130
Hey!

514
01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:13.010
Hey!

515
01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:38.470
Hey.

516
01:05:38.514 --> 01:05:41.343
Hey, asshole!

517
01:05:48.698 --> 01:05:50.657
Hey!

518
01:06:30.566 --> 01:06:32.307
Hey.

519
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:39.357
Holy shit, man.

520
01:06:45.494 --> 01:06:48.149
Hey.

521
01:06:48.192 --> 01:06:50.238
Did you think that I was
just gonna give up?


522
01:06:57.985 --> 01:06:59.508
What the hell's
going on here?


523
01:07:14.566 --> 01:07:17.613
There's a hole
in my floor.


524
01:07:17.656 --> 01:07:19.833
Einhorn won't fix it.

525
01:07:22.574 --> 01:07:26.056
Why are you telling me?

526
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.450
Well, you own the land.

527
01:07:28.493 --> 01:07:30.452
And my house.

528
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:36.980
Talk to Einhorn.

529
01:07:44.858 --> 01:07:46.947
You're deaf.

530
01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:57.827
Pleasure.

531
01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:25.028
You put these up?

532
01:08:29.163 --> 01:08:30.599
Yes.

533
01:08:30.642 --> 01:08:33.297
Why?

534
01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:35.691
Boredom.

535
01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:39.608
I guess I wanted to make it more difficult
to walk around a familiar space.


536
01:08:44.265 --> 01:08:46.136
Where's the hole?

537
01:08:59.019 --> 01:09:03.719
These columns go all the way
through the floor to the ground?


538
01:09:03.762 --> 01:09:05.242
You tried to put
a column there.


539
01:09:05.286 --> 01:09:07.201
That's why Einhorn
wouldn't fix it.


540
01:09:15.165 --> 01:09:17.167
I'll see what I can do.

541
01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.431
Thanks for stopping by.

542
01:09:30.746 --> 01:09:33.923
Father, you live inside me.

543
01:09:33.967 --> 01:09:37.057
The past lives inside me.

544
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.887
My body existed
before I was born.


545
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:45.108
It walked through a timeline
I wasn't part of.


546
01:09:45.152 --> 01:09:48.590
The past is imprinted
in my DNA.


547
01:10:38.509 --> 01:10:43.253
This body killed
a woman and a child.


548
01:10:43.297 --> 01:10:45.952
I was raised by a man
who murdered his wife


549
01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:49.172
and then killed himself.

550
01:10:49.216 --> 01:10:51.653
I'm an abomination.

551
01:12:18.218 --> 01:12:22.091
A riverfront property runs along
the front of all these cabins.


552
01:12:22.135 --> 01:12:23.484
It's just
a little clearing.


553
01:12:23.527 --> 01:12:25.964
Now, all of 'em.
And this, this is a road.


554
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.706
This is the end
of the property up here.


555
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:31.883
And there's a real nice
building site way up here.


556
01:12:31.927 --> 01:12:34.756
- Mm.
- And it overlooks the whole valley.


557
01:12:34.799 --> 01:12:36.758
- And then there's...
- Hey, boys.


558
01:12:46.724 --> 01:12:48.857
Wow.

559
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.512
You build this place
yourself?


560
01:12:51.555 --> 01:12:54.602
With the trees
that were standing here.


561
01:12:54.645 --> 01:12:56.604
I'll take a look.

562
01:12:59.911 --> 01:13:02.784
Do you want to look at a
bigger chunk of property here?


563
01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:05.308
Yeah.

564
01:13:05.352 --> 01:13:07.093
Through here.

565
01:13:07.136 --> 01:13:09.878
And then there's another chunk
up here on this map here.


566
01:13:09.921 --> 01:13:12.620
But you could be
something else.


567
01:13:12.663 --> 01:13:16.145
Like, it's some gorgeous
pieces of property here.


568
01:13:24.327 --> 01:13:26.460
Jesus Murphy.
You have a lot of books.


569
01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:28.549
Mm.

570
01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:33.336
Why don't you
give me one?


571
01:13:36.296 --> 01:13:38.211
Uh...

572
01:13:47.959 --> 01:13:50.484
What's this?

573
01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:54.531
When Benjamin was writing,
about 100 years ago,


574
01:13:54.575 --> 01:13:58.753
there was a massive jump
in the speed and accuracy


575
01:13:58.796 --> 01:14:00.581
of mass reproduction.

576
01:14:00.624 --> 01:14:03.061
He believed this
changed the context


577
01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:07.196
in which all art
could be understood.


578
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.024
How?

579
01:14:09.067 --> 01:14:12.984
The authenticity
of a work of reproduction.


580
01:14:13.028 --> 01:14:16.162
If the copy is the same
as the original,


581
01:14:16.205 --> 01:14:18.294
it's just as authentic.

582
01:14:18.338 --> 01:14:24.300
But an exact copy is different
in one very important respect.


583
01:14:26.172 --> 01:14:28.130
Time.

584
01:14:28.174 --> 01:14:31.220
One was created
after the other.


585
01:14:31.264 --> 01:14:33.701
So what?

586
01:14:33.744 --> 01:14:37.139
If anything, that makes
the copy more interesting.


587
01:14:37.183 --> 01:14:39.272
How do you figure?

588
01:14:39.315 --> 01:14:42.405
Well, it has all the same qualities
as the original, but it's...


589
01:14:42.449 --> 01:14:44.494
something different.

590
01:14:44.538 --> 01:14:47.193
But you just said
they're indistinguishable.


591
01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:49.630
- Yes, but...
- So, why do you now say...


592
01:14:49.673 --> 01:14:51.327
Wait, wait. Wait.

593
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:58.160
If an object could possess
some sort of historical quality,


594
01:14:58.204 --> 01:15:00.336
does the bullet that
killed Abraham Lincoln


595
01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.687
have some sort
of mystical quality?


596
01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:05.752
Something that the thousands
of other identical bullets


597
01:15:05.776 --> 01:15:08.692
that weren't used
don't have?


598
01:15:08.736 --> 01:15:14.263
Isn't intentionality
more important than appearance?


599
01:15:14.307 --> 01:15:18.267
No, the people interpret it
the way they choose.


600
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:20.051
A guy living in a cave.

601
01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:23.098
He sees "The Last Supper"
for the first time.


602
01:15:23.141 --> 01:15:28.582
Now, he might just see a bunch of
people sitting at a dinner table.


603
01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:32.499
But the ideas and the symbols
are still there.


604
01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:34.631
No, they're
shape and color.


605
01:15:34.675 --> 01:15:39.593
But it's the people
that give the thing meaning.


606
01:15:44.728 --> 01:15:46.339
What?

607
01:15:46.382 --> 01:15:48.123
It's just funny
coming from a guy


608
01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:51.474
that's been living out here
for, like, a thousand years.


609
01:15:51.518 --> 01:15:53.433
Let me as you something.

610
01:15:53.476 --> 01:15:58.916
If you could make an exact
reproduction of yourself,


611
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.091
would you?

612
01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:03.878
Sure.

613
01:16:03.921 --> 01:16:05.967
What would you do with it?

614
01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:09.492
I'd fuck it.

615
01:16:11.581 --> 01:16:14.062
No, wait.

616
01:16:14.105 --> 01:16:18.109
I'd fuck it,
I'd cook it,


617
01:16:18.153 --> 01:16:20.329
I'd kill it,
and eat it.


618
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.126
Are you lonely?

619
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:38.826
- Hmm?
- Are you lonely?


620
01:16:38.869 --> 01:16:40.393
You get used to it.

621
01:16:50.751 --> 01:16:52.796
I gotta go.

622
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.584
No.

623
01:16:57.627 --> 01:16:59.890
What?

624
01:17:01.414 --> 01:17:03.416
Yeah, go ahead.

625
01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:05.461
I'll come by
your place tomorrow.


626
01:17:26.395 --> 01:17:32.096
Father,
I remember the day at the carousel.


627
01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.142
John brought me there
because when I was younger,


628
01:17:34.185 --> 01:17:38.102
that was our favorite place.

629
01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:43.369
I remember stirrings of nostalgia
so bad my stomach ached.


630
01:17:43.412 --> 01:17:47.198
I remember in that moment,
wanting to go back


631
01:17:47.242 --> 01:17:49.418
to when I was even younger,

632
01:17:49.462 --> 01:17:52.900
back to waking up
in the back seat of the car


633
01:17:52.943 --> 01:17:56.817
when John would
carry me into the house.


634
01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.908
I try to hold onto memories,
but they fade.


635
01:18:00.951 --> 01:18:02.518
- Hmm.
- Ahem.


636
01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:04.085
I'd forgotten
what it feels like


637
01:18:04.128 --> 01:18:06.348
to know another person
is in the next room.


638
01:19:05.712 --> 01:19:07.453
No music.

639
01:21:40.606 --> 01:21:43.043
Nick?

640
01:22:06.327 --> 01:22:10.200
I know you.
I remember you.


641
01:22:10.244 --> 01:22:13.682
Well, I guess you would.

642
01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:17.686
Of course, I've only met
you before as a child.


643
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:18.905
Here, that is.

644
01:22:18.948 --> 01:22:20.689
Where you're from, I...

645
01:22:20.733 --> 01:22:23.387
- Where I'm from?
- Yeah.


646
01:22:23.431 --> 01:22:25.389
Where you're from.

647
01:22:25.433 --> 01:22:27.740
What year is it?

648
01:22:27.783 --> 01:22:30.481
- What?
- Humor me.


649
01:22:30.525 --> 01:22:33.397
Uh, it's 2033.

650
01:22:33.441 --> 01:22:35.835
2033.

651
01:22:35.878 --> 01:22:37.401
Maybe.

652
01:22:37.445 --> 01:22:39.186
Maybe not.

653
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:44.539
What if it's 300 years
past that?


654
01:22:44.582 --> 01:22:47.455
What if you're not
number two, Nick?


655
01:22:47.498 --> 01:22:51.502
But version 10
or version 20?


656
01:22:52.939 --> 01:22:55.463
Your friend,

657
01:22:55.506 --> 01:22:59.423
he looks familiar,
doesn't he?


658
01:22:59.467 --> 01:23:02.905
You think
he's an original?


659
01:23:02.949 --> 01:23:04.472
Original what?

660
01:23:04.515 --> 01:23:09.520
If you're number 20, eh,

661
01:23:09.564 --> 01:23:11.000
what if he's number 18?

662
01:23:11.044 --> 01:23:14.482
And you two have been
doing this same dance,


663
01:23:14.525 --> 01:23:18.878
with minor variations,
for a very long time?


664
01:24:17.327 --> 01:24:22.506
I took Nick out of school early today.

665
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:25.466
Wanted to take him
somewhere special.


666
01:24:25.509 --> 01:24:30.688
When I asked him, he told me he wanted
to go to the carousel in Brooklyn.


667
01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:34.214
Remember when we
used to take him there?


668
01:24:34.257 --> 01:24:37.347
Those are memories
I'll cherish forever.


669
01:24:37.391 --> 01:24:41.177
I wonder if the carousel
is also Dean's favorite place.


670
01:24:41.221 --> 01:24:44.659
I wonder how deep the
similarities run between them.


671
01:24:49.316 --> 01:24:51.840
I guess you know
the answer to that.


672
01:24:53.668 --> 01:24:55.888
- Is he here?
- No.


673
01:25:02.024 --> 01:25:04.418
I love you very much.

674
01:25:04.461 --> 01:25:08.770
And I love Nick very much.

675
01:25:08.814 --> 01:25:12.208
John? John!

676
01:25:47.417 --> 01:25:49.202
Nick.

677
01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.600
I love you, all right?

678
01:26:10.353 --> 01:26:13.443
- Wanna go out there?
- Sure.


679
01:26:15.619 --> 01:26:17.404
- Coming?
- Yeah.


680
01:26:17.447 --> 01:26:18.807
Yeah, I'll swim
out there in a bit.


681
01:28:24.618 --> 01:28:29.927
Father, why did you take
me in and raise me as your own?


682
01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:33.061
Was it penance?

683
01:28:33.105 --> 01:28:36.369
What did it feel
like to raise...


684
01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:40.068
yourself?

685
01:28:40.112 --> 01:28:45.856
How did the letter you wrote to
John and Selene end up at my door?


686
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.424
Who put it there?

687
01:28:48.468 --> 01:28:50.687
Did he?

688
01:28:50.731 --> 01:28:53.603
Is he a copy of John?

689
01:28:53.647 --> 01:28:55.910
I don't understand.

690
01:28:55.953 --> 01:29:00.349
Do you think you were crazy
when you killed his boy?


691
01:29:00.393 --> 01:29:05.615
Was it you who killed him,
or was it a copy?


692
01:29:05.659 --> 01:29:11.230
Am I a copy of you or
a copy of a copy of a copy?


693
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.624
Maybe I killed the boy.

694
01:29:18.498 --> 01:29:21.153
I feel like I'm going crazy.

695
01:29:23.894 --> 01:29:25.374
I need to know.

696
01:29:25.418 --> 01:29:30.292
I need to find proof
of... of what?


697
01:29:33.991 --> 01:29:35.645
Did you put the...

698
01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:38.387
did you put that letter
under my door?


699
01:29:40.172 --> 01:29:41.999
Did you put that letter
under my door?


700
01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:44.132
Did you... no, no!

701
01:29:44.176 --> 01:29:46.352
No! No! No!

702
01:29:46.395 --> 01:29:49.311
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry, no!


703
01:29:49.355 --> 01:29:53.228
Oh, no, don't do it!

704
01:29:53.272 --> 01:29:55.578
I'm sorry,
don't make me leave.


705
01:29:55.622 --> 01:29:57.232
Don't... no! No!

706
01:29:57.276 --> 01:29:59.626
Don't make me...
don't... no.


707
01:29:59.669 --> 01:30:01.671
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

708
01:30:01.715 --> 01:30:03.760
- Get out of my house.
- Please.


709
01:30:03.804 --> 01:30:09.288
- Get out of my house.
- Please. I'm sorry.


710
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:13.727
I'm so lonely.
I'm so lonely.


711
01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:19.298
I can't see you.

712
01:30:19.341 --> 01:30:22.692
I can't see you.

713
01:30:26.783 --> 01:30:28.481
Get out.

714
01:30:30.352 --> 01:30:34.269
Okay.

715
01:30:34.313 --> 01:30:37.359
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.


716
01:31:55.481 --> 01:31:57.570
Father.

717
01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:01.051
You once told me that everything
is already in the past.


718
01:32:01.095 --> 01:32:04.490
And you loved a line
from that old movie.


719
01:32:04.533 --> 01:32:07.493
"The present is real,
but you're not in it now.


720
01:32:07.536 --> 01:32:12.411
You're not in it now.
You're not in it now.


721
01:32:12.454 --> 01:32:15.109
By the time the light
bounces off something


722
01:32:15.152 --> 01:32:18.068
and into your eyes
it's already in the past."


723
01:32:18.112 --> 01:32:21.594
Everything we see
is past.


724
01:32:21.637 --> 01:32:25.119
Everything
has already past.


725
01:33:30.097 --> 01:33:34.144
But you're not
in it now.


726
01:33:34.188 --> 01:33:38.018
You're not in it now.

727
01:33:38.061 --> 01:33:41.064
You're not
in it now.


728
01:33:41.108 --> 01:33:45.547
You're not in it now.
