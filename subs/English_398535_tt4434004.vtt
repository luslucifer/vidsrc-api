Take out the packet.

Come on, Shamsher. Go for it!

3
00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:42.010
Hurry up.

4
00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.676
<i>Look! Look! Look! Look...</i>

5
00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:40.635
<i>Look up you wasted folk,
Right here into my face.</i>


6
00:05:41.218 --> 00:05:44.176
<i>Hold your arms tight,
I'm shooting up this place!</i>


7
00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:47.926
<i>Life's a thrill ride,
I'm gonna hit top</i> speed


8
00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:51.426
<i>Freedom and liberty,
It's all in the weed.</i>


9
00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.885
<i>Don't shy away from high,
Screw those asking why!</i>


10
00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:58.426
<i>If they don't let you try,
Just shoot them in the eye!</i>


11
00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:02.010
<i>I'll sing in my jammies,
I'll sing in the nude,</i>


12
00:06:02.426 --> 00:06:05.510
<i>Got a problem?
Get off my hood!</i>


13
00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:09.010
<i>I am what I am,
The coolest dude!</i>


14
00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:12.468
<i>Don't mess with me,
I'm an eagle on the prowl.</i>


15
00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:14.176
<i>I'm the daddy of swag,
Tsunami unleashed!</i>


16
00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:16.093
<i>Fans across the world,
No time to pause.</i>


17
00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:17.676
<i>All groove to my song,
Thugs or cops alike.</i>


18
00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:19.551
<i>Don't bullshit me,
I can read the future.</i>


19
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:21.510
<i>You follow your god,
I need no nurture.</i>


20
00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:49.718
<i>Oh darling white one,
Oh darling white one,</i>


21
00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:52.510
<i>You're our beloved happiness!</i>

<i>Oh sweet sugar, oh sweet sugar,</i>

23
00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:59.051
<i>One sniff is eternal bliss.</i>

24
00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:02.260
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

25
00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:12.718
<i>Oh brother Romeo</i>

26

<i>This is your true Juliet!</i>

27
00:07:15.676 --> 00:07:18.551
<i>Draw up that line,</i>

28
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:22.051
<i>Snort the heaven inside.</i>

29
00:07:26.843 --> 00:07:28.135
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

30
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.051
<i>They shall soar,</i>

31
00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:55.718
<i>The ones who sniff it all.</i>

32
00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:59.135
<i>You shall win,</i>

33

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:06.926
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

35
00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:24.510
<i>She is white but
She speaks Punjabi.</i>


36
00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:27.926
<i>She rules the mighty state of Punjab!</i>

37
00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:31.301
<i>She's a ball of fire,
Roll up in her charm.</i>


38
00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:35.010
<i>Shoot up your nerves,
Her love's crawling in</i>


39
00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:42.010
<i>Her love is crawling in!
Her love is crawling in!</i>


40
00:08:42.218 --> 00:08:45.426
<i>In the country, markets,
She's everywhere</i>


41
00:08:45.843 --> 00:08:48.885
<i>She's a friend to
Traders of the dark world</i>


42
00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:52.551
<i>In weddings, funerals,
She's everywhere</i>


43
00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:56.176
<i>In parties, dark alleys,
She quietly sneaks in</i>


44
00:08:56.343 --> 00:08:59.426
<i>She cuts across boundaries,
across times</i>


45
00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:03.051
She's <i>always there,
In your living, in dying</i>


46
00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:04.760
<i>Trade your life with her euphoria.</i>

47
00:09:05.051 --> 00:09:06.510
<i>It's her time now.</i>

48
00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:08.176
<i>Boy, girl, woman, man,
You can't escape her</i>


49
00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:10.260
<i>She'll strike a blow,
You scream with joy!</i>


50
00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:20.176
<i>Like a kite,</i>

51
00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:26.135
<i>Punjab is flying in the air!</i>

52
00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:34.176
<i>A Punjab of myriad colors,</i>

53
00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:41.426
<i>Has blown up in white.</i>

54
00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:54.426
<i>WELCOME TO PUNJAB!
(THE LAND OF FIVE RIVERS)</i>


55
00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:47.051
Hello...

56
00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:50.676
This is Bhandi speaking...

57
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.051
Told you not to get
Shamsher along.


58
00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:57.676
The loser can't aim.

59
00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:01.551
You think I have
nothing better to do?


60
00:11:02.468 --> 00:11:03.676
I can't find it.

61
00:11:05.301 --> 00:11:08.551
Just can't!
You are making a fool out of me.


62
00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.260
I don't have time for all this.

63
00:11:13.093 --> 00:11:15.301
Oh no, sister fucker!!!
Patrol officers are here!


64
00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:23.051
I'll be busted, assholes!

65
00:11:55.843 --> 00:11:57.926
<i>Tommy Singh in the house!</i>

66
00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:04.593
<i>Listen up!</i>

67
00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:08.051
<i>Tommy's got a tongue
sharp like Ecstasy.</i>


68
00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:11.426
<i>Tommy's lips taste
like Heroin's intimacy.</i>


69
00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:15.176
<i>Tommy's c*&k is white
as Coke's supremacy!</i>


70
00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:19.051
<i>Tommy's c*&k is white
as Coke's supremacy!</i>


71
00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:26.676
<i>C*&k-coke, coke-c*&k,
C*&k-coke, oh yeah, I am so high!</i>


72
00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:45.635
Shut it down!

73
00:12:47.093 --> 00:12:49.468
Bro, this is fucking killer stuff!

74
00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:51.260
I am telling you, we are
going to kill it, the market is...


75
00:12:51.468 --> 00:12:53.801
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&e...
It's going to be an anthem, man.


76
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:55.551
I can see it.
I can so fucking see it, man.


77
00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:58.468
Yo, bro! Coke-c*&k is the stuff.
Coke- c*&k is the scene


78
00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:00.051
This is the international stuff.

79
00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:02.176
I tell you,
this is going to be the next swag!


80
00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:05.468
UK, Canada...
Tommy, you are a bloody poet!


81
00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:06.426
'GABRU!'

82
00:13:08.093 --> 00:13:11.051
Isn't it a super hit?

83
00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:14.551
Can <i>we</i> hear the rest of the songs?

84
00:13:14.718 --> 00:13:17.551
The thing is... it's work in progress.

85
00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:21.510
Sunday... probably Monday...
Wednesday it'll be done for sure!


86
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.260
Have been hearing that
since three months.


87
00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:26.468
The release date has been
pushed twice already.


88
00:13:26.468 --> 00:13:28.426
The hoardings have gone up twice.

89
00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:32.010
You know what?
We didn't sign up for this.


90
00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:35.301
Son, hear me out.
Could you talk to him...


91
00:13:36.343 --> 00:13:37.676
I'm really sorry.

92
00:13:38.468 --> 00:13:40.801
We'll just have to call
the deal off, yeah?


93
00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:42.676
Bye!
- We can work something out.


94
00:13:42.843 --> 00:13:48.426
I've been away for dozen years,
brought myself a little frock.


95
00:13:49.218 --> 00:13:53.510
Tommy sets off a party,
as he yanks his white c*&k!


96
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:58.926
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...

97
00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:03.635
Time to let your mind unblock,
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...


98
00:14:07.343 --> 00:14:10.760
Those who bug, give 'em a sock.
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...


99
00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:14.301
<i>Motherfuckers!</i>

100
00:14:17.093 --> 00:14:18.676
The deal is off!

101
00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:21.051
Juggle your nuts now!

102
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.301
<i>Fuck!</i>

103
00:14:33.718 --> 00:14:35.926
Hello, Tommy. Are you there? Hello.

104
00:14:36.593 --> 00:14:37.926
You fired me, asshole!

105
00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:40.676
No no, Tommy.
You are misunderstanding me.


106
00:14:41.218 --> 00:14:41.676
Yes, you did.

107
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:45.176
No, Tommy.
Don't say that. You know...


108
00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.051
it just wasn't working out... okay?

109
00:14:47.218 --> 00:14:50.551
Wasn't working out?
Sister fucker, who am I?


110
00:14:51.051 --> 00:14:54.135
Your girlfriend?
Am I your fucking girlfriend?


111
00:14:55.218 --> 00:14:56.551
What do you want me to say, Tommy?

112
00:14:56.843 --> 00:14:57.551
Say it to my face.

113
00:14:58.468 --> 00:14:59.760
You fired me.

114
00:15:00.718 --> 00:15:01.176
Say it.

115
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.301
Say it.
- Alright, man.


116
00:15:04.468 --> 00:15:07.176
I fired you. Yeah, got it?

117
00:15:08.718 --> 00:15:10.426
He says that he's fired me.

118
00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:12.426
<i>He fired me, fucker!</i>

119
00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.051
Nobody fires Tommy!

120
00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:17.135
Alright.

121
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:18.760
Brother, brother...
- Nobody.


122
00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:20.426
Give it to him, fucker!

123
00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:23.426
Speedy, you sister fucker,
listen to me!


124
00:15:23.843 --> 00:15:28.010
Tommy's got record labels queuing
till Jalandhar & Chandigarh.


125
00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:31.301
Only Tommy fires Tommy.
Are you fucking Tommy?


126
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:33.176
Listen up, fucker!
- What the fuck are you laughing at?


127
00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:38.301
Fucker, you Whatsapp dad begging
for a concert with Tommy?


128
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:40.801
Suck on that!

129
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:43.176
Fucking shit!
- And what is your worth?


130
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:44.551
The best record labels in
the world want Tommy!


131
00:15:44.718 --> 00:15:46.635
Not you!
You bloody ear-grease!


132
00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:49.551
Who's the GABRU!?
- Who's your Daddy?!


133
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.510
Ask your hot wife who's the GABRU!?

134
00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:54.468
Speedy, we'll split
your behind open...


135
00:15:54.468 --> 00:15:57.176
and do a concert in there,
- You fucker!


136
00:15:57.676 --> 00:15:58.551
You!!

137
00:15:58.843 --> 00:16:01.760
I fire you. I double fire you.

138
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:04.676
Speedy, you bought an S-class?

139
00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:07.010
Move... move!

140
00:16:11.093 --> 00:16:12.551
You fucker!

141
00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:16.676
Nobody fires Tommy!

142
00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:17.926
Be careful.

143
00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:19.176
Only Tommy fires Tommy!

144
00:16:19.343 --> 00:16:20.676
I'm the GABRU!

145
00:16:21.218 --> 00:16:24.051
Speedy, <i>l'll</i> fuck you over!

146
00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:25.885
Ram into his bloody car!

147
00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:28.051
Overtake him from the right
and make him stop!


148
00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:31.385
Speedy, you motherfucker!

149
00:16:40.093 --> 00:16:41.801
Ambush his damn car, fucker!

150
00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:12.176
Be careful, bro.

151
00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:14.051
Fuck, are you crazy?

152
00:17:15.343 --> 00:17:16.426
Do you find this funny?

153
00:17:17.093 --> 00:17:20.135
Do you? The deal's off
and you're laughing?


154
00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:23.051
You are past your expiry date, babe.

155
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:25.385
It's over.

156
00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:27.635
Really?
- Really.


157
00:17:27.968 --> 00:17:31.135
And so are you, Tommy.
So are you!


158
00:17:47.468 --> 00:17:49.551
Why are the lights off?

159
00:17:50.676 --> 00:17:52.551
Switch on the lights.

160
00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:54.176
Anyone home?

161
00:17:55.843 --> 00:18:02.801
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!


162
00:18:02.801 --> 00:18:06.301
Tommy, the GABRU!

163
00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:10.176
Party!

164
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:19.426
There are cities in Mexico...

165
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:21.176
where the cops can't put a foot in.

166
00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:22.301
Really?

167
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.176
Drug lords are the bloody law.

168
00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:27.426
Don't get me wrong...

169
00:18:27.593 --> 00:18:30.135
but what have the police done here?

170
00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:32.385
The situation is the same.

171
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:37.301
The situation is the same?
- Yes, brother.


172
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.926
Stop that sister fucker!

173
00:18:42.218 --> 00:18:43.010
Stop him.

174
00:18:44.843 --> 00:18:46.676
Stop him!
- Get him down.


175
00:18:46.843 --> 00:18:50.010
Get down.

176
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:02.260
Brilliant!

177
00:19:02.968 --> 00:19:03.801
Where are your papers?

178
00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:06.426
It is election time.

179
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:08.676
Driving without papers, asshole?

180
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:12.176
Look at the packaging.

181
00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:13.885
With proper branding.

182
00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:16.051
First it was those mini-vans

183
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:17.301
now they're getting them in trucks.

184
00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:20.551
This is what they call progress.

185
00:19:21.468 --> 00:19:23.176
<i>Green revolution,</i> part <i>two.</i>

186
00:19:23.468 --> 00:19:25.010
But what about our progress?

187
00:19:25.301 --> 00:19:27.926
Our cut is still the same.
Fucking 10,000 rupees!


188
00:19:28.343 --> 00:19:30.551
Can <i>we</i> get anything in 10,000?
- No.


189
00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:33.926
I think they've taken
the Punjab police for granted.


190
00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:36.426
There's no regard
for law and order here.


191
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.301
If this continues,
Punjab will become Mexico.


192
00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:42.176
Sister fucker, you will turn Punjab into Mexico?
- No, sir.


193
00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:43.551
I will not, sir!

194
00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:44.801
I feel he surely will.

195
00:19:44.801 --> 00:19:47.676
No, sir. I will not
turn it to a Mexico. Never!


196
00:19:47.843 --> 00:19:50.718
Tell your boss to up
our commission.


197
00:19:50.718 --> 00:19:53.176
It's a red light here!

198
00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:54.301
No green light.

199
00:19:54.468 --> 00:19:56.801
Yes, sir.
- Fuck off!


200
00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:00.135
Make it quick... move!

201
00:20:01.593 --> 00:20:03.926
See... cop power?

202
00:20:04.343 --> 00:20:05.426
Yes.

203
00:20:06.343 --> 00:20:09.010
Who is calling?
Yes, sir.


204
00:20:11.468 --> 00:20:13.760
<i>I'll</i> be there... right away.

205
00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:14.676
Go to hell!

206
00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:17.385
Let's go, Sartaj.

207
00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:20.760
<i>I'll</i> show you what
'law and order' can do.


208
00:20:21.426 --> 00:20:26.801
<i>"Baby, come sit in my car
We'll celebrate your happy birthday</i>


209
00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:31.801
<i>"Baby, come sit in my car
We'll celebrate your happy birthday</i>


210
00:20:39.093 --> 00:20:42.426
<i>Unleash the dog
Till the dawn is to crack.</i>


211
00:20:47.051 --> 00:20:51.010
<i>Set the world on fire,
Time to payback.</i>


212
00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:58.385
<i>Unleash the dog
Till the dawn is to crack.</i>


213
00:20:58.843 --> 00:21:02.801
<i>Set the world on fire,
Time to payback.</i>


214
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.801
<i>Infinite lines of coke,
Who keeps a track?</i>


215
00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:07.801
The cops are here!

216
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:10.676
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

217
00:21:10.843 --> 00:21:13.885
Stop this nonsense.
- Party is over!


218
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:16.801
Sir! This is a birthday...
- Stop it!


219
00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:18.301
Sir, this is a birthday party.

220
00:21:18.301 --> 00:21:19.301
Where is Tommy?

221
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:21.801
Sir, Tommy is not here.
It is a birthday party.


222
00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:22.801
Where is Tommy?

223
00:21:22.801 --> 00:21:25.010
Sir, Tommy is not here.
Back off!


224
00:21:25.593 --> 00:21:27.218
Sir, Tommy is not here.

225
00:21:27.218 --> 00:21:28.676
He's lying.
- Liar!


226
00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:30.635
I am not lying. 
I swear on you.

227
00:21:31.593 --> 00:21:33.176
What happened?

228
00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:36.010
Gracing us with your presence at <i>3</i> am?

229
00:21:36.593 --> 00:21:37.760
Is there a problem?

230
00:21:38.218 --> 00:21:40.343
Get some tea and cookies.
We've got guests.


231
00:21:40.343 --> 00:21:43.176
No need for that.
We have orders from the top.


232
00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:47.301
Get Tommy here. Or all these
sister fuckers will gets arrested.


233
00:21:48.218 --> 00:21:52.426
Tommy?
He left for London yesterday.


234
00:22:34.176 --> 00:22:35.176
Who's the GABRU?

235
00:22:37.718 --> 00:22:39.093
I'm the GABRU.

236
00:22:39.093 --> 00:22:39.801
What?

237
00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.010
I didn't hear that.

238
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:45.135
I'm the GABRU.

239
00:22:48.093 --> 00:22:49.051
Haven't you eaten?

240
00:22:49.426 --> 00:22:50.801
I'm the GABRU.

241
00:22:51.051 --> 00:22:52.551
I still can't hear you.

242
00:22:52.718 --> 00:22:58.676
I'm the GABRU.

243
00:23:00.843 --> 00:23:04.176
Didn't Tommy go to London?

244
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:08.676
So apparently he is here.

245
00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:13.385
But he has given up cocaine.
Doesn't even touch it.


246
00:23:13.551 --> 00:23:20.260
Listen up sister fuckers!
I am the fucking GABRU!


247
00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:30.176
Tommy Singh's arrest is
the latest development...


248
00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:33.635
in the drug crisis that has been
plaguing Punjab for the last few years...


249
00:23:33.843 --> 00:23:38.176
And we have with us eminent politician
MP - Mr. Maninder Brar


250
00:23:38.426 --> 00:23:41.051
Instead of taking concrete
steps to tackle the drug menace...


251
00:23:41.301 --> 00:23:43.885
Why is the government going
for soft targets like Tommy Singh.


252
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:45.551
People like Tommy Singh -

253
00:23:45.718 --> 00:23:49.093
they are the ones who are encouraging
drug addiction in our society


254
00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:52.135
with their music,
with their choice of lifestyle.


255
00:23:52.801 --> 00:23:55.260
Look at the kind of videos
they are making.


256
00:23:56.176 --> 00:24:00.218
I think the youth of Punjab deserves
a better role model than Tommy Singh.


257
00:24:00.218 --> 00:24:01.051
Bloody phoney!

258
00:24:01.218 --> 00:24:04.051
- The milk's come to a boil.
Turn off the stove!


259
00:24:04.218 --> 00:24:05.301
- Please understand this.

260
00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:06.926
Breakfast!

261
00:24:07.343 --> 00:24:09.635
Drop Balli off to college.
He's still asleep.


262
00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:11.468
Good morning to you also!

263
00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:16.426
Phagwara's boy transformed from
Punjab's Gabru to a menace to society.


264
00:24:17.843 --> 00:24:18.426
Greetings.

265
00:24:18.593 --> 00:24:21.635
Greetings, son. You ready?

266
00:24:22.468 --> 00:24:23.551
Good morning, grandma.

267
00:24:23.718 --> 00:24:25.301
Bless you, son.

268
00:24:25.301 --> 00:24:27.010
I am very worried about Balli.

269
00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:30.051
He wears sunglasses even at home.

270
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:31.426
Even at home?
- Doesn't study at all.


271
00:24:31.426 --> 00:24:32.760
Let me talk to him.

272
00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:35.010
Balli!

273
00:24:36.301 --> 00:24:37.176
Balli!

274
00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:39.551
Balli!

275
00:24:43.301 --> 00:24:43.926
Get ready.

276
00:24:44.718 --> 00:24:45.426
Aren't you late for college?

277
00:24:46.843 --> 00:24:47.801
And remove this idiot's poster.

278
00:24:51.343 --> 00:24:53.676
With your precious vote,

279
00:24:53.843 --> 00:24:57.301
make Rajveer Singh Pehlwan win.

280
00:24:57.468 --> 00:25:01.135
His victory is yours as well.

281
00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:05.885
Please vote for him!

282
00:25:06.218 --> 00:25:09.635
Vote for Rajveer Singh!

283
00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:22.426
Listen...

284
00:25:23.218 --> 00:25:23.926
Come here...

285
00:25:28.051 --> 00:25:28.801
Need money?

286
00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:35.551
If I find you at a coffee shop,
<i>l'll</i> thrash you.


287
00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:39.051
Thank you!

288
00:25:50.093 --> 00:25:54.385
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I"m getting it.


289
00:25:57.718 --> 00:25:58.676
Give me two today.

290
00:26:07.801 --> 00:26:08.760
Faster.

291
00:26:11.718 --> 00:26:13.176
Greetings.

292
00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:16.301
Greetings. How are you?

293
00:26:20.968 --> 00:26:23.093
Why? You took very long.

294
00:26:23.093 --> 00:26:26.385
You know, Punjab roads are a mess.

295
00:26:27.551 --> 00:26:29.801
Here's the stuff you asked for.

296
00:26:29.968 --> 00:26:32.676
This one is white
and this is the pink stuff.


297
00:26:34.218 --> 00:26:37.926
This one is for five grand
and this is for 10.


298
00:26:38.093 --> 00:26:39.510
This one is very good as well.

299
00:26:39.676 --> 00:26:41.426
Try it once

300
00:26:42.218 --> 00:26:43.926
and you'll surely ask for more!

301
00:26:48.051 --> 00:26:49.551
What are you doing here?

302
00:26:50.843 --> 00:26:52.676
My stomach is hurting.

303
00:26:53.343 --> 00:26:54.551
I need to go to the doctor.

304
00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:56.593
Get back by 12 o'clock.

305
00:26:56.593 --> 00:26:58.051
Or <i>I'll</i> cut your entire day's pay.

306
00:26:58.343 --> 00:26:59.551
Run along.

307
00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:01.676
There's a shortage.

308
00:27:02.343 --> 00:27:03.676
Check the stuff.

309
00:27:12.051 --> 00:27:15.301
That soap. The red one.

310
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:16.676
The one on top?

311
00:27:22.926 --> 00:27:25.301
There used to be a huge crowd

312
00:27:25.468 --> 00:27:26.676
at the tea stall earlier.

313
00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:28.301
Who drinks tea these days?

314
00:27:28.593 --> 00:27:31.510
They are all drugged out at the ruins.

315
00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:41.926
Did you see Tommy's pose?

316
00:27:42.551 --> 00:27:44.301
Take that, yo, sister fucker!

317
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:46.885
His brother caught Tommy.

318
00:27:47.343 --> 00:27:48.885
Did-k!

319
00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:53.051
Idiot!

320
00:27:55.218 --> 00:27:58.885
Don't take it to heart, my love.

321
00:28:02.468 --> 00:28:03.676
Who are you?

322
00:28:04.343 --> 00:28:05.801
What are you looking at?

323
00:28:07.843 --> 00:28:09.010
Do you want stuff?

324
00:28:10.093 --> 00:28:11.301
What do you have?

325
00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:13.010
Powder.

326
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:15.260
Heroin?

327
00:28:15.468 --> 00:28:17.301
What?
- Heroin?


328
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:19.426
Yes. That. Heroin.

329
00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:22.051
I don't have any money. Ask them.

330
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:24.635
You ask them. And take a commission.

331
00:28:26.593 --> 00:28:27.426
How much?

332
00:28:28.218 --> 00:28:29.260
How much can you offer?

333
00:28:29.593 --> 00:28:30.676
3000 is the going rate.

334
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:33.051
How much do you have?

335
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:34.260
Three.

336
00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:36.301
Come tomorrow.
<i>I'll</i> have it arranged.


337
00:28:36.468 --> 00:28:37.426
Full three grams, right?

338
00:28:37.676 --> 00:28:38.426
Kilos!

339
00:28:40.551 --> 00:28:41.551
Three kilos!

340
00:28:42.218 --> 00:28:44.801
Where did you get that much stuff?

341
00:28:45.051 --> 00:28:46.885
Do you really want it?
Or should I leave?


342
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:50.760
Nobody can buy it here.

343
00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:54.176
There is someone in town.
Raja, he is...


344
00:28:54.176 --> 00:28:55.301
Give me his mobile...

345
00:28:56.718 --> 00:28:57.801
Number...

346
00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:03.635
9988... I will take 10 percent.

347
00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:05.510
What?
- 10 percent. 10!


348
00:29:05.718 --> 00:29:06.926
No. Five percent.

349
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:11.051
Alright)!-

350
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:14.426
He's back.

351
00:29:14.968 --> 00:29:16.926
Brother of a cop!

352
00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:21.135
Again... already?

353
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:22.260
Easy, bro!

354
00:29:22.926 --> 00:29:24.176
Give it an hour at least.

355
00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:26.426
Get lost.

356
00:29:27.093 --> 00:29:29.176
Don't act like a roadie, bro!

357
00:29:35.218 --> 00:29:37.301
Balli...! Balli...!

358
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:03.635
Give me the blood pressure set. Hurry!

359
00:30:05.593 --> 00:30:07.926
Is that what you do in college?

360
00:30:14.468 --> 00:30:15.676
Balli?

361
00:30:16.218 --> 00:30:17.385
Doctor...

362
00:30:17.926 --> 00:30:19.301
Is he going to make it?

363
00:30:19.468 --> 00:30:20.426
Wait outside.

364
00:30:20.593 --> 00:30:22.051
The doctor is coming. Please.

365
00:30:22.051 --> 00:30:24.926
So call the doctor. 
Who is the doctor?

366
00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:26.176
Please wait outside.
- Balli...


367
00:30:26.343 --> 00:30:28.176
Inform the traffic police.

368
00:30:30.051 --> 00:30:32.676
Turn him on his side.
How many times should I tell you?


369
00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:42.135
Open your eyes, kiddo.

370
00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:45.260
Show me the readings.

371
00:30:49.718 --> 00:30:51.051
Get the IV line started.

372
00:30:51.343 --> 00:30:53.676
Prepare a Naloxone injection.
Double dose.


373
00:30:53.968 --> 00:30:54.801
Madam...

374
00:30:56.093 --> 00:30:57.051
Will he be okay?

375
00:30:57.593 --> 00:30:59.010
Please wait outside.

376
00:31:00.301 --> 00:31:02.301
Please wait outside. Please.

377
00:31:02.676 --> 00:31:06.676
If you have any sort of addiction -

378
00:31:06.843 --> 00:31:10.093
alcohol or drugs
- you just let us know.


379
00:31:10.093 --> 00:31:13.093
We will get you off any addiction.

380
00:31:13.093 --> 00:31:15.968
Cough syrup, smack or heroin...

381
00:31:15.968 --> 00:31:18.426
we have a solution...

382
00:31:18.593 --> 00:31:20.135
You can have it

383
00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:22.301
Give it to your mate

384
00:31:22.468 --> 00:31:23.676
To your family.

385
00:31:23.926 --> 00:31:25.426
We will cure everyone.

386
00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:29.301
Madam, thank you.

387
00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:34.593
What did he have? Heroin?

388
00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:36.301
Hard to say right now.

389
00:31:36.468 --> 00:31:38.760
But he's been doing it for a while.

390
00:31:38.968 --> 00:31:40.176
Heavy dosage.

391
00:31:40.176 --> 00:31:42.176
No, madam.
The boys must have forced him.


392
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:44.051
My Balli isn't the kind.

393
00:31:46.176 --> 00:31:47.260
Have you seen his hands?

394
00:31:48.218 --> 00:31:50.510
His veins are turning blue,
thanks to the needles.


395
00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:55.426
"My boy is not like that,
it's the others!"


396
00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.426
Madam...

397
00:31:59.468 --> 00:32:00.385
Madam...

398
00:32:02.343 --> 00:32:05.010
Sorry, madam. I had no idea.

399
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:08.926
I was just checking, madam...

400
00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:10.801
Will he be able to give it up?

401
00:32:10.801 --> 00:32:12.051
It is up to him.

402
00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:13.551
And his environment.

403
00:32:13.551 --> 00:32:16.801
At such high dependence,
a person loses comprehension.


404
00:32:17.093 --> 00:32:18.968
He is my younger brother.

405
00:32:18.968 --> 00:32:20.926
Dad left me to raise him.

406
00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:25.426
After he's discharged,
bring him to my clinic.


407
00:32:25.593 --> 00:32:28.843
Maqbool road,
opposite Rajju's mansion.


408
00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:30.635
We'll do our best.

409
00:32:31.593 --> 00:32:32.885
Okay?

410
00:32:48.926 --> 00:32:50.176
Hello.

411
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.510
Stuff... Do you want stuff?

412
00:32:56.593 --> 00:32:58.926
Wrong number.
- Three kilos of heroin.


413
00:32:59.176 --> 00:33:01.260
I will not call again.

414
00:33:05.843 --> 00:33:07.010
How much?

415
00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:09.885
Three thousand.

416
00:33:10.843 --> 00:33:12.176
Write down the address.

417
00:33:16.426 --> 00:33:17.676
Just a second.

418
00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:29.676
Birdbrain!

419
00:33:29.843 --> 00:33:36.301
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

420
00:33:36.468 --> 00:33:38.801
ten thousand!

421
00:33:55.218 --> 00:33:56.551
Is anyone there?

422
00:33:57.218 --> 00:34:02.135
Please let me talk to Mr. Brar.

423
00:34:02.676 --> 00:34:04.843
Maninder Brar, MP

424
00:34:04.843 --> 00:34:08.260
I performed at his daughter's wedding.

425
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:10.426
I am Tommy Singh.

426
00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:12.885
Let me talk to him.

427
00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:18.010
Let me talk to him.

428
00:34:27.676 --> 00:34:29.760
At least give me water.

429
00:34:31.718 --> 00:34:34.760
I should at least get water,
sister fuckers!


430
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:37.926
This is wrong, sister fuckers!

431
00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:40.343
It's 'human rights', sister fuckers!

432
00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:43.426
Give me water right now!

433
00:34:43.426 --> 00:34:46.635
Give me water!

434
00:34:52.843 --> 00:34:54.260
What happened?

435
00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:56.468
<i>You want to go home'?</i>

436
00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:57.551
Go then.

437
00:34:57.926 --> 00:35:00.135
The bail can happen later, sir.

438
00:35:00.551 --> 00:35:03.385
You're a celebrity, after all. VIP!

439
00:35:03.718 --> 00:35:06.676
Kartar, take out the jeep.

440
00:35:07.468 --> 00:35:09.551
We have to drop sir back home.

441
00:35:11.593 --> 00:35:12.885
This way, sir.

442
00:35:15.843 --> 00:35:19.676
Sister fucker, so you are the GABRU?

443
00:35:20.843 --> 00:35:23.176
Sister fucker,
you're spoiling the youth.


444
00:35:23.176 --> 00:35:24.676
You fucker!

445
00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:26.301
You are the GABRU, right?

446
00:35:34.843 --> 00:35:37.801
Become a man first, then a VIP.

447
00:35:37.968 --> 00:35:39.635
Loser!

448
00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:24.051
<i>Ambarsar is high, Jalandhar,
Ludhiana and Moga, every burb.</i>


449
00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:27.551
<i>You try it too, brother,
Don't fear, don't curb.</i>


450
00:36:27.843 --> 00:36:35.135
<i>Daddy is high, brother is high,
Uncles are digging it on the sly,</i>


451
00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:39.551
<i>Strong and the weak snort it alike
Let the white power strike.</i>


452
00:36:40.426 --> 00:36:42.343
We were in the 8th grade

453
00:36:42.343 --> 00:36:44.551
when your first song released.

454
00:36:45.218 --> 00:36:47.260
We are your fans since.

455
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:49.926
We want to be like you.

456
00:36:50.301 --> 00:36:51.760
The GABRU!

457
00:36:52.468 --> 00:36:54.801
The first time I injected myself,

458
00:36:54.968 --> 00:36:58.051
I swear,
all I could see was your face!


459
00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:04.426
Mother fuckers!
You've killed your mother.


460
00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:06.426
And now you sing songs here?

461
00:37:06.593 --> 00:37:08.385
Aren't you ashamed!

462
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:13.510
She was not giving us money.

463
00:37:13.843 --> 00:37:17.176
We needed to have our fix.
What else could we do.


464
00:38:01.593 --> 00:38:06.551
<i>Tales of a lonely night,</i>

465
00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:10.801
<i>Lone in a daze,
Nobody in sight</i>


466
00:38:11.176 --> 00:38:15.885

Don't turn back to look</i>

00:38:30.343 --> 00:38:35.051
<i>Look what just crept up from behind</i>

471
00:38:35.468 --> 00:38:39.010
<i>Fear of the unknown
Turning me blind.</i>


472
00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:44.885
<i>Keep an eye,
Tread with caution</i>


473

<i>The world is shrinking into a dot</i>

479
00:39:11.093 --> 00:39:13.426
<i>I can't breathe,
I'm left to rot.</i>


480
00:39:13.593 --> 00:39:15.968
<i>Draw me a few lines,
I beg of you.</i>


481
00:39:15.968 --> 00:39:18.051
<i>Let me snort happiness,
I beg of you.</i>


482

<i>My veins throbbing with desire
Just one inhale, and I'll retire</i>


485
00:39:27.843 --> 00:39:30.135
<i>I feel empty, 
I feel lonely.</i>

486
00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:32.426
<i>I am agitated, 
I can't go on.</i>

487
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:34.801
<i>My body is trembling,
My soul on fire</i>


488
00:39:35.093 --> 00:39:37.135
<i>Death is crooning,
Feels like my pyre</i>


489
00:39:37.468 --> 00:39:39.760
<i>My gullet is dry as a bone</i>

490
00:39:39.926 --> 00:39:42.301
<i>Life is leaving me
One breath at a time.</i>


491
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:44.635
<i>When will this misery end
When will I end?</i>


492
00:39:44.843 --> 00:39:47.426
<i>I run and hide
From nobody but myself.</i>


493
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:48.551
I think she is the same girl...

494
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:49.635
Faster!

495
00:40:02.593 --> 00:40:04.926
Bro, why is she running
into the fields?


496
00:41:04.968 --> 00:41:07.676
Kuku, stop her, sister fucker!
What is she doing?


497
00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:09.676
Yes, sir.
- Run... run!


498
00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:13.801
Ruining our stuff, bitch!

499
00:41:28.343 --> 00:41:31.051
Here you go, Jackie Chan.

500
00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:52.176
Greetings.

501
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.635
Greetings to you too.

502
00:41:54.093 --> 00:41:56.051
Will you have some buttermilk?

503
00:42:09.843 --> 00:42:10.635
Greetings.

504
00:42:11.343 --> 00:42:12.510
Bhandi at your service, sir!

505
00:42:13.676 --> 00:42:15.426
Look at me!

506
00:42:17.218 --> 00:42:18.551
She is from Bihar.

507
00:42:18.968 --> 00:42:21.301
A labourer in Karnail Singh's farm.

508
00:42:22.093 --> 00:42:25.760
Such meticulous planning, the bitch!

509
00:42:27.093 --> 00:42:30.176
That explains the
fucking missing delivery.


510
00:42:32.843 --> 00:42:35.926
Sister fucker!

511
00:42:44.593 --> 00:42:47.760
Let Jackie Chan have him.

512
00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:49.010
Let's go, sister fucker!

513
00:42:53.093 --> 00:42:56.051
Listen... don't kill him.

514
00:42:57.176 --> 00:42:58.926
He is family.

515
00:42:59.093 --> 00:43:00.926
Take him to the fields.

516
00:43:07.426 --> 00:43:10.801
Sir, what to do with her?

517
00:43:11.218 --> 00:43:14.051
She isn't family, right?

518
00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:28.301
Child, the stuff was worth 10 million.

519
00:43:30.468 --> 00:43:34.176
If you wanted to throw it,

520
00:43:34.343 --> 00:43:37.176
then why did you steal it?

521
00:44:29.676 --> 00:44:32.926
Let me go.

522
00:44:32.926 --> 00:44:33.968
Just for a little while.

523
00:44:33.968 --> 00:44:35.051
It won't take long.

524
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:48.176
Leave me!
- Bitch


525
00:44:53.343 --> 00:44:56.926
Leave me.
- Listen to me.


526
00:45:05.593 --> 00:45:09.301
Leave me. Let me go.

527
00:45:24.176 --> 00:45:26.010
Come.
- Calm down.


528
00:45:26.218 --> 00:45:28.801
Now grab me.

529
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:37.135
Grab her.

530
00:45:38.718 --> 00:45:39.926
Leave me.

531
00:45:40.426 --> 00:45:44.176
I'll teach her a lesson.
Hold her down.


532
00:45:45.551 --> 00:45:47.635
Leave me, motherfuckers!

533
00:46:07.593 --> 00:46:09.926
"After a whole week..."

534
00:46:10.093 --> 00:46:13.426
"Tommy Singh was finally
released from prison today."


535
00:46:13.593 --> 00:46:17.051
"While agreeing to his bail,
the court has specified..."


536
00:46:17.218 --> 00:46:21.843
"that his celebrity status
shouldn't warrant any leniency."


537
00:46:21.843 --> 00:46:23.385
Move aside.

538
00:46:25.968 --> 00:46:28.301
- Tommy, who is the GABRU?

539
00:46:28.301 --> 00:46:30.301
- Where has the GABRU gone?
- Where has Tommy, the GABRU gone?


540
00:46:30.968 --> 00:46:34.010
At least let me get inside. Move.

541
00:46:45.218 --> 00:46:46.801
A single person takes to drugs.

542
00:46:48.968 --> 00:46:52.176
But, it affects the entire family.

543
00:46:53.301 --> 00:46:55.551
Initially,
drugs are taken for pleasure.


544
00:46:56.176 --> 00:47:00.426
Later, drugs become their life goal.
- Open the door, I beg you!


545
00:47:00.968 --> 00:47:04.885
Love, friends, family,
career, education...


546
00:47:05.218 --> 00:47:05.885
Nothing remains!

547
00:47:06.093 --> 00:47:09.676
What do I do with you?

548
00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.176
Leave him, Sartaj.

549
00:47:11.343 --> 00:47:13.093
Let him go, son. Let him go.

550
00:47:13.093 --> 00:47:14.385
Leave him.

551
00:47:15.843 --> 00:47:17.301
I'm away from home all day.

552
00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:19.051
How do I know what's happening here?

553
00:47:19.218 --> 00:47:21.426
You all should've
taken care of him.


554
00:47:28.093 --> 00:47:30.135
Everything that is
beautiful within the person,


555
00:47:31.718 --> 00:47:37.926
his adorations in life,
drugs finishes off everything.


556
00:47:39.968 --> 00:47:41.926
I am not reciting hearsay.

557
00:47:45.968 --> 00:47:47.051
I have seen it with my own eyes.

558
00:47:53.468 --> 00:47:54.801
Sign here.

559
00:48:00.343 --> 00:48:02.468
Mother, I want to go home.

560
00:48:02.468 --> 00:48:04.218
Don't worry, son.

561
00:48:04.218 --> 00:48:05.676
Just a little longer.

562
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:08.718
Shyam, take him to the ward.

563
00:48:08.718 --> 00:48:10.301
Go with them, kiddo.

564
00:48:11.718 --> 00:48:12.801
- Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:48:13.801 --> 00:48:14.926
Let's go, my dear.

566
00:48:15.426 --> 00:48:16.926
Thank you, Madam.

567
00:48:16.926 --> 00:48:19.176
Now it's all up to you. Thank you.

568
00:48:21.968 --> 00:48:23.760
Wait a moment.
- Yes?


569
00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:37.885
Next time, don't come here
in your uniform.


570
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:39.801
Why?

571
00:48:40.093 --> 00:48:41.426
What were you saying the other day?

572
00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:44.801
You weren't aware of what was
happening with your brother?


573
00:48:45.051 --> 00:48:47.718
Have any idea what's
happening in Jashanpura?


574
00:48:47.718 --> 00:48:50.551
In Amritsar? In Tarn Taran?
In all of Punjab?


575
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:52.926
Do you have any idea?

576
00:48:53.301 --> 00:48:54.843
You're an Assistant Inspector, right?

577
00:48:54.843 --> 00:48:55.885
Which department?

578
00:48:56.718 --> 00:48:58.176
What is the matter, madam?

579
00:48:58.176 --> 00:48:59.801
Why are you talking to me like this?

580
00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:02.801
What's your 'cut'
for not having an idea?


581
00:49:03.801 --> 00:49:06.176
Ten thousand a week, isn't it?

582
00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:08.051
Then why have you got him here?

583
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:10.426
Take him to a private clinic in Delhi.

584
00:49:10.426 --> 00:49:11.593
What is it, Madam?

585
00:49:11.593 --> 00:49:13.051
Because I am silent...

586
00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:14.551
What will you say?

587
00:49:14.926 --> 00:49:17.176
It doesn't bother you
to ruin a generation.


588
00:49:17.343 --> 00:49:18.968
But when it <i>comes</i> to
your brother, it hurts?


589
00:49:18.968 --> 00:49:20.135
Madam...

590
00:49:22.468 --> 00:49:24.301
This is what he's addicted to.

591
00:49:25.093 --> 00:49:27.801
A combination of Pheniramine
and buprenorphine.


592
00:49:28.718 --> 00:49:31.135
You must've seen
this bottle somewhere.


593
00:49:31.801 --> 00:49:33.760
Or do you have
no idea about this too?

594
00:49:37.176 --> 00:49:39.468
They are two separate drugs...

595
00:49:39.468 --> 00:49:42.051
that should only be
sold with prescription.


596
00:49:42.218 --> 00:49:46.176
But thanks to you, the producers are
combining these drugs...


597
00:49:46.176 --> 00:49:48.718
and sellers are openly selling them

598
00:49:48.718 --> 00:49:51.426
by the name of 'Chaand',
in every chemist shop.


599
00:49:51.426 --> 00:49:53.260
For a mere 50 rupees.

600
00:49:53.551 --> 00:49:55.885
The price of your brother's life!

601
00:50:01.968 --> 00:50:03.010
It's my turn tonight.

602
00:50:03.843 --> 00:50:05.926
Let them go, baby.

603
00:50:06.801 --> 00:50:07.801
Let them go.

604
00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.010
All good?

605
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:17.385
Do you want to do her?

606
00:50:20.343 --> 00:50:21.301
She looks good.

607
00:50:21.968 --> 00:50:22.551
Let go.

608
00:50:22.801 --> 00:50:24.926
I need to buy a phone, sir.
- Buy it next time.


609
00:50:26.926 --> 00:50:28.010
Will you buy it for me?

610
00:50:31.093 --> 00:50:33.801
Sir, what are you doing?

611
00:50:33.968 --> 00:50:36.176
He's a regular on this route.

612
00:50:36.176 --> 00:50:39.010
Sir, leave him, he'll die.

613
00:50:39.718 --> 00:50:42.676
Leave him.
- What happened?


614
00:50:51.843 --> 00:50:53.176
Let it go.

615
00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:56.718
Are you out of your mind?

616
00:50:56.718 --> 00:50:59.885
It is Pehelwan's truck, sister fucker!
Get him water.


617
00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:05.468
It happens. He just lost it.

618
00:51:05.468 --> 00:51:07.885
Hey, get him bandaged.

619
00:51:08.218 --> 00:51:12.426
Here, take this, go on.

620
00:51:12.968 --> 00:51:15.260
You leave the truck at Pehelwan's.

621
00:51:15.968 --> 00:51:16.551
Okay, sir.

622
00:51:16.968 --> 00:51:17.760
Don't mention anything to anyone.

623
00:51:18.551 --> 00:51:19.176
Hurry up.

624
00:51:22.093 --> 00:51:23.551
There is a system.

625
00:51:23.718 --> 00:51:25.760
And everyone has to follow it.

626
00:51:26.968 --> 00:51:29.551
I can handle him being beaten up.

627
00:51:30.301 --> 00:51:33.260
But how can you damage his truck?

628
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:37.385
It is Pehelwan's truck!

629
00:51:39.176 --> 00:51:41.051
Pehelwan is a Member of Parliament.

630
00:51:41.593 --> 00:51:44.135
Yet he pays our cut. Doesn't he?

631
00:51:44.718 --> 00:51:46.301
He can have both of us suspended.

632
00:51:46.468 --> 00:51:48.135
Brother, I want to go home.

633
00:51:48.343 --> 00:51:50.051
Go home.

634
00:51:50.801 --> 00:51:52.385
Take care of Balli.

635
00:51:52.926 --> 00:51:53.676
Go.

636
00:51:56.593 --> 00:51:58.426
Whatsapp me if there is a problem.

637
00:52:49.593 --> 00:52:52.926
- Make it quick. 
There's a lot to finish.

638
00:52:54.676 --> 00:52:55.926
- No Issues.

639
00:52:56.176 --> 00:52:58.551
- Everything is in control.

640
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:00.676
- No, no. It's okay.

641
00:53:01.093 --> 00:53:02.551
- Hey, boss is here.

642
00:53:14.093 --> 00:53:15.801
- Come. Have some tea.

643

00:54:38.343 --> 00:54:39.885
Hello, baby.

648
00:54:46.093 --> 00:54:47.551
Baby...

649
00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.676
Look here!

650
00:54:51.593 --> 00:54:53.010
Look here!

651
00:54:53.843 --> 00:54:55.301
Smile please...

652
00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:02.676
It's nice.

653
00:55:03.968 --> 00:55:05.676
You look pretty.

654
00:55:17.551 --> 00:55:19.801
Tell me if you need anything.

655
00:55:21.093 --> 00:55:22.635
Anything for you.

656
00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:44.051
We've spoilt you.

657
00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.093
She is quite petite.

658
00:56:30.093 --> 00:56:31.635
She looked okay on the phone.

659
00:56:33.301 --> 00:56:34.176
New phone?

660
00:56:35.676 --> 00:56:37.801
Yes, sir. I bought it for 8000 rupees.

661
00:56:38.843 --> 00:56:41.926
Eight thousand! 
You aren't worth it.

662
00:56:43.593 --> 00:56:45.635
New phone!

663
00:56:55.343 --> 00:56:56.551
She won't bite, right?

664
00:56:57.301 --> 00:57:00.176
No, sir. She's well trained now.

665
00:58:34.093 --> 00:58:37.510
Hey, Tommy. My darling child!

666
00:58:38.218 --> 00:58:39.426
Do one thing...

667
00:58:39.718 --> 00:58:42.260
Just make one hit number!

668
00:58:42.718 --> 00:58:44.926
Just one monster hit song!

669
00:58:45.343 --> 00:58:48.551
And then there is that
anti-drug concert.


670
00:58:48.718 --> 00:58:52.010
It's the best step for our image.

671
00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:54.801
Will help the case too.

672
00:58:55.551 --> 00:59:00.926
Public will know that our Tommy
is no more into drugs.


673
00:59:01.468 --> 00:59:02.510
He's clean now.

674
00:59:33.468 --> 00:59:37.801
Told you it's not happening.

675
00:59:38.343 --> 00:59:39.301
Told you!

676
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:52.676
Uncle...

677
00:59:54.093 --> 00:59:57.510
I think our bro here
can probably do with some inspiration.


678
01:00:04.426 --> 01:00:06.010
Sister fuckers!

679
01:00:07.468 --> 01:00:12.551
Your 'inspiration'
sent my boy to jail.


680
01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:14.926
Now, if you even mention it...
- I am sorry, uncle.


681
01:00:22.926 --> 01:00:24.551
I want to go to London.

682
01:00:27.968 --> 01:00:29.926
I want to go to London!

683
01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:33.010
I have to go to London.

684
01:00:34.176 --> 01:00:35.010
You shut up!

685
01:00:36.218 --> 01:00:37.385
Killed your mother!

686
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.551
I want to go to London!

687
01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:44.885
Going to London, fuckers!

688
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:48.051
Open the door, Monty.

689
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:50.885
I say open the door.
- Please, sir.


690
01:00:51.718 --> 01:00:55.551
Please, sir. Stop.

691
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.426
Please don't.
- I'll shoot!


692
01:00:58.426 --> 01:01:01.301
No... no!
- Move away.


693
01:01:01.301 --> 01:01:03.301
Bro, what are you doing?
- Get out of my way.


694
01:01:03.301 --> 01:01:05.426
<i>I'll</i> shoot.
- No... no!


695
01:01:05.718 --> 01:01:07.593
Son...

696
01:01:07.593 --> 01:01:11.801
Son, the court will decide
if you can go or not.


697
01:01:12.218 --> 01:01:14.593
You only do your concert.

698
01:01:14.593 --> 01:01:16.718
I don't want to do the concert.
I want to go.


699
01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:18.843
Please let me go, uncle.

700
01:01:18.843 --> 01:01:20.176
Sister fucker!

701
01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:23.510
You'll shoot me? Me?

702
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:26.176
I made you a star.

703
01:01:26.593 --> 01:01:30.676
Your father had abandoned you, sister fucker!.
- I want to go, uncle.


704
01:01:30.676 --> 01:01:34.968
I got your younger sister married, fucker!
- I want to go...


705
01:01:34.968 --> 01:01:38.426
And you'll shoot me? Shoot me!

706
01:01:38.718 --> 01:01:39.551
Let me go.

707
01:01:39.551 --> 01:01:40.801
Shoot... shoot!

708
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:57.010
- Call your mom in the morning.

709
01:02:04.676 --> 01:02:06.510
Get up Kiddo.

710
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:10.135
Get up, child. Easy!
- No!


711
01:02:10.968 --> 01:02:12.051
Have the medicine.

712
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:15.010
Have. You'll feel better.
- I won't!


713
01:02:15.468 --> 01:02:16.301
It isn't bitter.

714
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:17.676
Very good!

715
01:02:56.843 --> 01:02:59.260
They're luring voters with drugs this
election, not alcohol or blankets.


716
01:02:59.718 --> 01:03:01.176
Trucks are loaded with this stuff.

717
01:03:01.343 --> 01:03:04.676
Godowns are getting filled.
It's a well organized operation.


718
01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:07.385
Party workers will be
distributing them in every village.


719
01:03:07.968 --> 01:03:11.176
I will drag Pehelwan
by his balls to jail.


720
01:03:11.968 --> 01:03:14.926
I will either lose
my job or I will get shot.


721
01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:19.385
You decide if you want to
take it to the media.


722
01:03:20.343 --> 01:03:23.301
It may get difficult to
hush the matter later.


723
01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:26.926
Might get your name
on all the front pages too!


724
01:03:31.718 --> 01:03:33.051
Fighting from within the system...

725
01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:35.926
and shouting slogans
from the sidelines...


726
01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:37.760
You'll realise the difference
with this case, madam.


727
01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:48.426
Hey listen... hello!

728
01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:51.801
What's the point in arresting
Pehelwan alone?


729
01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:53.010
What?

730
01:03:54.051 --> 01:03:56.343
There is a Pehelwan sitting
in every district.


731
01:03:56.343 --> 01:03:57.218
So?

732
01:03:57.218 --> 01:03:59.551
Pehelwan is just a dealer
of these drugs.


733
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.301
The manufacturers are
the ones to be arrested.


734
01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:04.051
Find out about their factory.
Raid them.


735
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:06.176
Madam, have you seen my uniform?

736
01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.093
How many stars do I have?

737
01:04:08.093 --> 01:04:09.093
One star.

738
01:04:09.093 --> 01:04:10.551
What does one star mean?

739
01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:13.051
D.l.G.? Commissioner?

740
01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:14.801
I am only an Assistant.

741
01:04:14.801 --> 01:04:17.676
You said that this stuff is being
made to lure voters.


742
01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:19.718
So there must be
a political connection.


743
01:04:19.718 --> 01:04:22.051
There is no political connection.
This is politics!


744
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:24.343
The sermons that you give
on TV about narco politics.


745
01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:25.093
This is it.

746
01:04:25.093 --> 01:04:26.676
So many MPs are dealers themselves.

747
01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:30.926
We can shout from the rooftops,
no one will listen to us.


748
01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:35.426
Election Commission.

749
01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:39.093
Elections will take place in a month.

750
01:04:39.093 --> 01:04:41.801
Right now, the Commission
is powerful in the state.


751
01:04:42.218 --> 01:04:44.176
Add media pressure to that,

752
01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:46.385
they'll be forced to take action.

753
01:04:46.676 --> 01:04:49.676
But everything has to be
done before the elections.


754
01:05:02.343 --> 01:05:04.468
I am sorry about yesterday.

755
01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.385
Hang on.
I just want to talk to you.


756
01:05:09.801 --> 01:05:12.176
Sir, I am just a driver.

757
01:05:12.468 --> 01:05:13.551
From the factory to the godown,

758
01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:15.093
and godown to the factory.

759
01:05:15.093 --> 01:05:16.801
I don't know about these games.

760
01:05:17.843 --> 01:05:19.635
Your factory is in Barotiwala

761
01:05:20.218 --> 01:05:22.010
near the Himachal border, isn't it?

762
01:05:22.426 --> 01:05:23.843
Come, let's take a ride.

763
01:05:23.843 --> 01:05:26.801
No, sir. I will lose my job.

764
01:05:26.968 --> 01:05:30.676
I came from my village
just to earn a living.


765
01:05:40.593 --> 01:05:42.093
I have to arrange for
my sister's wedding, too.


766
01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:43.801
<i>Fuck off!</i>

767
01:05:53.468 --> 01:05:55.426
I've been snooping around
the factory for four days, madam.


768
01:05:56.468 --> 01:05:58.176
Inside out.

769
01:05:58.468 --> 01:05:59.676
Took lot of pics too.

770
01:06:01.718 --> 01:06:03.551
From outside, the factory appears
to be shut for long.


771
01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.176
Just some guards outside.

772
01:06:06.843 --> 01:06:08.426
Work happens in the morning shift.

773
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:11.551
9 AM through 7 PM.

774
01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:12.676
Covertly.

775
01:06:16.343 --> 01:06:18.301
I searched everywhere but
I found nothing.


776
01:06:18.843 --> 01:06:20.301
Looked into the workshop, too.

777
01:06:20.593 --> 01:06:21.926
Inspected the machines.

778
01:06:23.843 --> 01:06:25.551
I saw some oil bottles there

779
01:06:25.968 --> 01:06:27.635
but no names on them.

780
01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:32.760
No factory signboard either.

781
01:06:34.926 --> 01:06:37.301
We won't get information
about the owners from here.


782
01:06:51.218 --> 01:06:55.176
These are the chemicals used
to make this drug.


783
01:06:55.426 --> 01:06:58.551
Ethanol, Hydrochloric Acid, Methyl,
Paraben, Maleic Acid, Opium.


784
01:07:00.051 --> 01:07:01.301
They aren't easy to procure.

785
01:07:01.801 --> 01:07:04.010
Some are imported...
and some are controlled.


786
01:07:04.343 --> 01:07:05.385
Like Opium.

787
01:07:06.093 --> 01:07:08.760
Only two places in India where
opium is legally manufactured...


788
01:07:09.343 --> 01:07:11.176
Neemuch and Ghazipur.

789
01:07:11.968 --> 01:07:14.426
Detailed paper work is required
to source opium from there...


790
01:07:14.968 --> 01:07:15.926
with thorough inspection.

791
01:07:16.593 --> 01:07:18.676
Any random company
can't procure from there.


792
01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:22.551
It is issued to licensed
pharmaceutical companies only.


793
01:07:25.843 --> 01:07:28.426
Now, if they are procuring such large
amounts of opium...


794
01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:36.010
it means either a pharma company or
its employee is supplying them illegally.


795
01:07:36.593 --> 01:07:40.926
And they are doing all the paper
work behind a bogus company.


796
01:07:41.426 --> 01:07:44.801
If we find out the name of
this company and its owner


797
01:07:45.301 --> 01:07:48.051
we'll understand the entire
political nexus, Sartaj.


798
01:07:48.218 --> 01:07:50.176
That's it. Their game will be over.

799
01:07:50.968 --> 01:07:52.551
I'm slow in these matters.

800
01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:54.760
I barely made it past college.

801
01:07:55.718 --> 01:07:57.551
I've been at it since four days.

802
01:07:57.551 --> 01:08:00.051
Whatever I could find, I have.

803
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:01.926
You can take someone's help.

804
01:08:01.926 --> 01:08:03.176
Whose help can I take?

805
01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:06.176
If anyone in the
department finds out...


806
01:08:07.218 --> 01:08:11.010
Think, Sartaj. 
Think of something.

807
01:08:11.843 --> 01:08:13.301
Are you bloody mad?

808
01:08:13.676 --> 01:08:16.051
Only you know this chemical business.

809
01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:18.426
Are you out of your mind? No way!

810
01:08:18.718 --> 01:08:20.301
We will go after the shift is over.

811
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:22.010
Except for two watchmen,
nobody is going to be there.


812
01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:23.301
We don't have to go today.

813
01:08:23.593 --> 01:08:24.676
Maybe after a couple of days.

814
01:08:25.051 --> 01:08:26.510
This is not my job, Sartaj.

815
01:08:27.676 --> 01:08:30.426
I am a doctor. 
A lady at that.

816
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:34.218
All the men in Punjab
are drugged out, madam.


817
01:08:34.218 --> 01:08:36.676
Now it's up to the ladies.

818
01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.051
You have saved Balli's life.

819
01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:42.051
I won't let anything happen to you.

820
01:08:44.593 --> 01:08:46.760
Careful!

821
01:08:47.968 --> 01:08:52.051
Where is Tommy's Diet Coke?

822
01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:53.051
I had the Diet Coke kept.

823
01:08:53.051 --> 01:08:55.301
Where is the Diet Coke?
- Where is the Diet Coke, sister f****r!?


824
01:08:56.218 --> 01:08:57.426
Get the Diet Coke.

825
01:08:57.593 --> 01:08:59.510
This should have been put first.

826
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:01.426
Careful.

827
01:09:01.426 --> 01:09:02.801
Get it fast.

828
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:07.885
Son, it happens.

829
01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:10.551
It was cocaine's withdrawal symptom

830
01:09:10.718 --> 01:09:11.926
Love you...

831
01:09:12.426 --> 01:09:15.176
Hug <i>me</i> as well, daddy.

832
01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:23.301
How are you?
- All okay?


833
01:11:23.301 --> 01:11:24.801
Do you want a dose?
- No.


834
01:11:24.968 --> 01:11:27.093
Our man's shooting up at the back.
Go join.


835
01:11:27.093 --> 01:11:28.676
I have a bad stomach.

836
01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:30.676
Okay then.

837
01:11:30.926 --> 01:11:33.343
They've put us on a double shift.

838
01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:35.093
They think we are dogs.

839
01:11:35.093 --> 01:11:36.051
Why don't you say something?

840
01:11:36.218 --> 01:11:39.801
There's no point to it.
Who cares about us?


841
01:11:43.551 --> 01:11:48.010
Tommy! Tommy!

842
01:11:51.343 --> 01:11:54.426
Move aside.

843
01:13:28.468 --> 01:13:34.801
There was an election rally at Jashanpura,
organized by Maninder Brar...


844
01:13:35.051 --> 01:13:38.051
He addressed over thousand people...

845
01:13:38.218 --> 01:13:44.301
He raised the issue of
drugs ruining the youth...


846
01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:48.510
He appealed to the people,
asking their support in this issue.


847
01:13:48.843 --> 01:13:52.051
I want to tell the youth of Punjab...

848
01:13:52.343 --> 01:13:55.926
that this whole fight,

849
01:13:56.343 --> 01:13:58.260
this war on drugs,

850
01:13:58.843 --> 01:14:01.926
is above all, an individual war.

851
01:14:03.968 --> 01:14:06.051
We're with you in this war.

852
01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:08.260
We are here to support you.

853
01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:11.426
I appeal to the the youth of Punjab,

854
01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:14.260
to fight it back!

855
01:14:14.468 --> 01:14:16.218
My dear young ones, march on!

856
01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:17.301
We are with you.

857
01:14:17.593 --> 01:14:19.051
My dear young ones, march on!

858
01:14:19.968 --> 01:14:21.051
We are with you.

859
01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:34.885
Hey, Kaka, Lucky, Sonu!

860
01:14:35.093 --> 01:14:37.510
Get up all of you!
She's running away.


861
01:15:45.426 --> 01:15:46.385
Found anything?

862
01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:51.885
Look at this.

863
01:15:52.926 --> 01:15:54.551
They want to ruin all of Punjab.

864
01:15:57.468 --> 01:15:58.551
What are they on to?

865
01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.426
There is nothing here, Sartaj.

866
01:16:09.801 --> 01:16:10.801
Let's look over there.

867
01:16:24.968 --> 01:16:26.426
Come on. Let's get going.

868
01:16:26.968 --> 01:16:28.676
Wasn't it a day off today?

869
01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:35.176
- Sir, the Ghazipur goods are here.

870
01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:40.010
Sartaj, I think this
is the consignment


871
01:16:40.343 --> 01:16:42.385
This is what we were looking for.

872
01:16:42.843 --> 01:16:44.510
Do you have a safety pin?

873
01:16:47.551 --> 01:16:49.801
Come out as soon
as I call you. Okay?

874
01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:50.760
<i>Okay.</i>

875
01:16:50.968 --> 01:16:53.301
Don't worry. I am here.

876
01:17:04.968 --> 01:17:07.135
- Be careful.

877
01:17:09.843 --> 01:17:12.176
- Watch it, it's heavy.

878
01:17:17.176 --> 01:17:17.968
- Keep it here.

879
01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:19.385
- Hurry.

880
01:17:20.718 --> 01:17:22.551
- Get that here.

881
01:17:23.718 --> 01:17:25.385
- Faster.

882
01:17:30.468 --> 01:17:32.051
- Move it.

883
01:17:33.968 --> 01:17:35.718
- <i>Easy...'</i>

884
01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.426
- I got it...

885
01:17:37.426 --> 01:17:38.926
[Opium and Alkaloids]

886
01:17:38.926 --> 01:17:40.426
- Move it.

887
01:17:49.718 --> 01:17:52.926
Good job.
Brother, please take over.


888
01:17:53.676 --> 01:17:54.676
What happened?

889
01:18:03.093 --> 01:18:04.760
What's with the power?

890
01:18:05.051 --> 01:18:06.676
I think the power has gone out.

891
01:18:06.843 --> 01:18:07.676
Even I know that.

892
01:18:07.843 --> 01:18:09.093
The power has not gone.

893
01:18:09.093 --> 01:18:10.301
There are lights outside.

894
01:18:10.301 --> 01:18:11.468
Only our factory is blacked out.

895
01:18:11.468 --> 01:18:13.301
I think the fuse must have blown.

896
01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:14.843
Why are you standing here
and talking about it?


897
01:18:14.843 --> 01:18:15.843
Do something.

898
01:18:15.843 --> 01:18:16.676
Come on.
- Come.


899
01:18:16.843 --> 01:18:18.051
Check if there's a lose connection.

900
01:18:18.218 --> 01:18:20.301
Turn the damn generator on!

901
01:18:20.843 --> 01:18:22.593
Just find some help.

902
01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:24.176
Everything is okay here...

903
01:18:24.176 --> 01:18:25.718
Did you find anything?

904
01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:27.051
No. Everything is okay here.

905
01:18:27.718 --> 01:18:29.510
Turn the damn generator on!

906
01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:40.510
This damn power cut!

907
01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:45.176
Thank God, the power's back on.

908
01:18:45.176 --> 01:18:48.010
Everybody back to work.

909
01:18:48.676 --> 01:18:49.301
What was the problem?

910
01:18:49.468 --> 01:18:51.301
The fuse was down.

911
01:19:47.176 --> 01:19:48.176
Come on hurry up.

912
01:19:50.093 --> 01:19:50.885
Come on.

913
01:19:51.968 --> 01:19:52.926
Sartaj...

914
01:19:53.218 --> 01:19:55.051
Sartaj, come on.

915
01:19:57.093 --> 01:19:58.135
<i>Leave it. I'll ride.</i>

916
01:20:00.343 --> 01:20:01.135
Sit tight.

917
01:20:36.093 --> 01:20:41.635
Stop!

918
01:21:09.176 --> 01:21:12.551
Tommy, try the blonde look.

919
01:21:13.051 --> 01:21:14.301
It will suit you.

920
01:21:15.343 --> 01:21:17.260
GABRU, The Great!

921
01:21:31.093 --> 01:21:32.801
My hero...

922
01:21:35.426 --> 01:21:37.260
The crowd is in a crazy mood.

923
01:21:37.843 --> 01:21:39.135
Rock the show!

924
01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:41.426
Daddy, relax!

925
01:21:41.593 --> 01:21:42.676
You're adding to the pressure.

926
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:45.801
What is your problem?

927
01:21:46.093 --> 01:21:49.760
We're just talking.
None of your business.


928
01:22:00.426 --> 01:22:01.385
I can't do this.

929
01:22:04.468 --> 01:22:06.801
Ricky, enough already!

930
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:09.051
You want to turn him into Lady Gaga?

931
01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:10.301
Funny, eh?

932
01:22:11.843 --> 01:22:13.051
Get lost.

933
01:22:13.926 --> 01:22:16.051
<i>I will</i> thrash you.

934
01:22:17.843 --> 01:22:19.926
Brother, I understand.

935
01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.760
If there's no fuel in the car,
will it run?


936
01:22:23.968 --> 01:22:25.801
<i>Never.</i>

937
01:22:26.343 --> 01:22:29.551
And our car is a
Range Rover.


938
01:22:30.093 --> 01:22:34.135
When you drive a Range Rover,
you need more fuel.


939
01:22:36.968 --> 01:22:38.301
Fuel.

940
01:22:38.926 --> 01:22:40.301
Now you tell me,

941
01:22:40.593 --> 01:22:42.135
who's the GABRU?

942
01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:43.885
Say it!

943
01:22:44.843 --> 01:22:46.051
Get ready quickly.

944
01:22:46.301 --> 01:22:47.301
I am out of here.

945
01:22:49.218 --> 01:22:51.635
And yeah, I love you, too!

946
01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:17.926
Where is it?

947
01:23:21.426 --> 01:23:22.926
Can I say something, madam?

948
01:23:23.593 --> 01:23:24.551
Go on.

949
01:23:26.343 --> 01:23:27.676
I...

950
01:23:31.968 --> 01:23:33.051
Sartaj...

951
01:23:33.468 --> 01:23:35.260
I want to take you on a date.

952
01:23:35.676 --> 01:23:36.760
Sartaj...

953
01:23:37.051 --> 01:23:38.510
Will you come to
a coffee shop with me?


954
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:40.051
Sartaj?

955
01:23:56.968 --> 01:23:58.801
Madam...

956
01:24:00.093 --> 01:24:01.926
I've never seen a lady like you.

957
01:24:03.343 --> 01:24:05.426
You are surrounded by filth.

958
01:24:06.593 --> 01:24:08.926
Yet, you are absolutely clean.

959
01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:12.551
Dignity.

960
01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:17.426
Okay. Now get up.

961
01:24:22.468 --> 01:24:24.801
You sitting too far away, madam.

962
01:24:27.343 --> 01:24:28.926
Do you know?

963
01:24:30.051 --> 01:24:31.801
What hit me the most...

964
01:24:32.551 --> 01:24:37.551
Life's <i>worst</i> tragedy, Madam,

965
01:24:41.218 --> 01:24:45.426
To lose someone you love,

966
01:24:49.593 --> 01:24:52.051
And not being able
to do anything about it.


967
01:24:52.468 --> 01:24:54.301
Father had passed away.

968
01:24:55.468 --> 01:24:57.301
If my brother had too...

969
01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.885
That day, you didn't save
him, but me instead.


970
01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:06.051
Sartaj, look at me.

971
01:25:07.468 --> 01:25:08.051
Look at me.

972
01:25:08.218 --> 01:25:10.676
Now show me your tongue.

973
01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:13.885
Martyr Sartaj Singh.

974
01:25:15.593 --> 01:25:17.801
Nothing is going to happen to Balli.

975
01:25:19.093 --> 01:25:20.260
Nothing.

976
01:25:22.468 --> 01:25:23.676
Are you sure?

977
01:25:24.843 --> 01:25:25.926
Promise.

978
01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:31.551
Brave warrior-madam, Preet Sahni!

979
01:25:32.343 --> 01:25:34.385
Commander, drugs on war.

980
01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:38.010
Not drugs on war,
war on drugs.


981
01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:40.468
And I am no hero.

982
01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:41.885
I am only trying.

983
01:25:43.843 --> 01:25:46.260
There are two wars going on in Punjab.

984
01:25:47.093 --> 01:25:48.801
The one you and I are fighting

985
01:25:49.593 --> 01:25:52.551
against people like Pehelwan,
against the system.


986
01:25:54.051 --> 01:25:56.260
That is easy.

987
01:25:57.926 --> 01:26:00.176
The real war on drugs...

988
01:26:00.176 --> 01:26:03.176
is the one that people
like Balli are fighting.


989
01:26:03.593 --> 01:26:05.135
With themselves.

990
01:26:08.218 --> 01:26:10.301
If they win, we win.

991
01:26:12.343 --> 01:26:13.801
If they lose, Punjab...

992
01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:17.510
loses!

993
01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:23.801
And so, Punjab has lost!

994
01:26:26.218 --> 01:26:27.801
Sartaj...

995
01:26:28.301 --> 01:26:29.551
What happened?

996
01:26:33.343 --> 01:26:35.385
Okay. Come here.

997
01:27:28.968 --> 01:27:31.426
Where could she be?
- Look over there!


998
01:27:53.843 --> 01:28:02.385
Presenting Tommy, the GABRU!

999
01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:29.176
Bro, are you okay?

1000
01:28:32.676 --> 01:28:35.051
Rock and roll, bro.

1001
01:29:21.218 --> 01:29:27.051
GABRU!

1002
01:29:42.843 --> 01:29:48.135
GABRU!

1003
01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.176
Have you seen him?

1004
01:29:52.593 --> 01:29:54.135
Has anyone seen GABRU?

1005
01:29:56.343 --> 01:29:58.301
How will you see him?

1006
01:30:00.676 --> 01:30:03.051
Some are lying in the gutters.

1007
01:30:05.176 --> 01:30:07.801
Swimming in their own vomit.

1008
01:30:08.468 --> 01:30:11.010
And some have already
made it to the other side.


1009
01:30:11.301 --> 01:30:12.426
Dead!

1010
01:30:12.843 --> 01:30:14.676
Sing us a song already!

1011
01:30:15.468 --> 01:30:17.801
<i>I willsing a song, too.</i>

1012
01:30:18.176 --> 01:30:20.176
First, hear what I have to say.

1013
01:30:21.593 --> 01:30:23.301
Meet me.

1014
01:30:24.718 --> 01:30:26.801
Do you want to meet him?

1015
01:30:28.093 --> 01:30:33.301
Do you want to meet
the real Tommy Singh?


1016
01:30:34.676 --> 01:30:36.176
Statutory warning -

1017
01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:39.176
He's no GABRU!

1018
01:30:39.468 --> 01:30:41.801
Now, do you want to meet him?

1019
01:30:42.093 --> 01:30:46.260
Then... here is Tommy
Singh in 3,2,1...


1020
01:30:46.551 --> 01:30:48.801
<i>[L
-O
-S
-E
-R]</i>

1021
01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:53.260
This is Tommy Singh.

1022
01:30:54.093 --> 01:30:55.260
Loser!

1023
01:30:57.718 --> 01:31:01.051
A small town boy,
Tejender Singh Loser,


1024
01:31:03.426 --> 01:31:08.301
Scored a visa and went to
Birmingham, once upon a time.


1025
01:31:09.926 --> 01:31:12.593
Somehow his music worked.

1026
01:31:12.593 --> 01:31:15.426
Otherwise, he would be driving a cab.

1027
01:31:16.593 --> 01:31:18.635
Or waiting tables.

1028
01:31:19.718 --> 01:31:22.426
He scraped through high school.

1029
01:31:24.218 --> 01:31:26.551
He just knew one thing.

1030
01:31:28.468 --> 01:31:29.551
Drugs.

1031
01:31:32.843 --> 01:31:35.176
And he sang about it.

1032
01:31:38.093 --> 01:31:40.551
And you folks thought
it was philosophy?


1033
01:31:45.968 --> 01:31:51.801
You folks are bigger
losers than I am, fuckers!


1034
01:31:52.593 --> 01:31:55.885
Come on, sing the song already!

1035
01:31:56.093 --> 01:31:58.885
And you're the biggest loser,

1036
01:31:59.051 --> 01:32:00.926
since you still don't get it!

1037
01:32:01.093 --> 01:32:03.801
We aren't here for your sermons.

1038
01:32:04.093 --> 01:32:05.343
Sing or get lost!

1039
01:32:05.343 --> 01:32:06.676
Sing or get lost.

1040
01:32:06.676 --> 01:32:14.051
Sing or get lost!

1041
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:26.968
You want to hear a song?

1042
01:32:26.968 --> 01:32:28.551
Do you?

1043
01:33:33.301 --> 01:33:35.176
Where's the car? Fuck!

1044
01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.176
Where is the Range Rover?

1045
01:33:38.718 --> 01:33:39.510
Oh damn!

1046
01:33:58.551 --> 01:34:01.176
He must be here somewhere.

1047
01:34:01.676 --> 01:34:03.176
Get the car quickly.

1048
01:34:27.343 --> 01:34:28.801
Stay back!

1049
01:34:29.843 --> 01:34:32.926
Let me hide.

1050
01:34:35.468 --> 01:34:36.926
Who are you?

1051
01:34:36.926 --> 01:34:38.093
Tommy.

1052
01:34:38.093 --> 01:34:39.093
A dog?

1053
01:34:39.093 --> 01:34:41.426
A singer. Tommy Singh.

1054
01:34:43.218 --> 01:34:44.801
Please let me hide.

1055
01:34:45.718 --> 01:34:47.593
Over there.

1056
01:34:47.593 --> 01:34:49.801
Thank you.
- Shut up!


1057
01:35:15.718 --> 01:35:17.051
Do you have stuff?

1058
01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:26.051
Who you hiding from?

1059
01:35:28.218 --> 01:35:29.176
From myself.

1060
01:35:29.343 --> 01:35:30.135
Huh?

1061
01:35:30.926 --> 01:35:32.051
From myself.

1062
01:35:33.968 --> 01:35:35.010
Moron.

1063
01:35:35.593 --> 01:35:37.051
The biggest one.

1064
01:35:38.093 --> 01:35:39.676
Not bigger than me, Tommy boy.

1065
01:35:39.676 --> 01:35:41.343
Oh, come on!

1066
01:35:41.343 --> 01:35:43.635
I am the champion of morons.

1067
01:35:44.093 --> 01:35:46.051
His Highness Moron Number One.

1068
01:35:48.218 --> 01:35:50.051
Look where I've landed up.

1069
01:35:50.968 --> 01:35:53.385
You think I lost my way here?

1070
01:35:53.718 --> 01:35:55.551
If you hear my story,
you'll shit your pants.


1071
01:35:55.718 --> 01:35:57.676
Let it be.

1072
01:35:58.468 --> 01:36:00.301
It is even written on my head.

1073
01:36:00.718 --> 01:36:04.135
<i>Look.</i>

1074
01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.135
<i>Look.</i>

1075
01:36:12.218 --> 01:36:14.426
That's L-O-S-E-R written.
- Yes, loser.


1076
01:36:15.551 --> 01:36:16.718
They mean the same thing.

1077
01:36:16.718 --> 01:36:18.260
How so?

1078
01:36:18.843 --> 01:36:21.260
A loser is a loser,
a moron is a moron.


1079
01:36:25.718 --> 01:36:27.635
That makes sense.

1080
01:36:28.718 --> 01:36:30.926
A loser is a loser...

1081
01:36:31.176 --> 01:36:32.926
and a moron is a moron.

1082
01:36:42.551 --> 01:36:44.926
Wear it.

1083
01:36:50.051 --> 01:36:52.926
I was wondering...

1084
01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:56.051
I wont be able to do it alone.

1085
01:37:00.468 --> 01:37:02.426
Will you commit suicide with me?

1086
01:37:04.843 --> 01:37:06.051
Get lost!

1087
01:37:08.051 --> 01:37:10.010
I am not that big a moron.

1088
01:37:11.843 --> 01:37:14.676
Loser, don't you plant
these ideas in my head.


1089
01:37:14.676 --> 01:37:16.051
Hit me. You also fucking hit me.

1090
01:37:16.051 --> 01:37:17.343
Then why are you talking rubbish?

1091
01:37:17.343 --> 01:37:19.760
What else should I do?

1092
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.551
Who wants to hear
the fucking right thing?


1093
01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:26.051
They only want rubbish which
I've said for four years.


1094
01:37:26.218 --> 01:37:28.051
Made <i>me</i> a pop star! The Fuck!

1095
01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.801
A pop star at fucking 22!

1096
01:37:31.093 --> 01:37:33.426
Asian underground number three.

1097
01:37:33.676 --> 01:37:35.926
Tommy, the GABRU!

1098
01:37:35.926 --> 01:37:38.051
And now... poof!

1099
01:37:39.926 --> 01:37:45.093
Think... if someone tells you
that your best times are over.


1100
01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:46.551
And they won't come back.

1101
01:37:46.718 --> 01:37:48.301
The stuff is finished.
Party over!


1102
01:37:48.301 --> 01:37:49.635
Go home.

1103
01:38:16.968 --> 01:38:18.010
Sorry.

1104
01:39:24.676 --> 01:39:27.926
Run away!

1105
01:39:31.801 --> 01:39:33.176
Bloody loser!

1106
01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:35.426
Why won't the good times come?

1107
01:39:35.593 --> 01:39:38.301
Look what's become of me...

1108
01:39:38.301 --> 01:39:39.801
I am no moron.

1109
01:39:39.801 --> 01:39:42.051
Hockey champion,
district player!


1110
01:39:42.051 --> 01:39:44.551
I thought I'd see good times
if I played state level.


1111
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:46.676
But my father dropped dead.

1112
01:39:46.676 --> 01:39:47.593
When I got over that...

1113
01:39:47.593 --> 01:39:49.551
my hockey stick was
replaced with a sickle.


1114
01:39:49.718 --> 01:39:53.135
Left home, reached Sarhota
village to work in the farms.


1115
01:39:53.676 --> 01:39:55.843
One day a packet flew from the skies.

1116
01:39:55.843 --> 01:39:59.301
I thought, if I sold it,
I'd finally see good times.


1117
01:39:59.968 --> 01:40:02.468
That's it. The biggest fuck up!

1118
01:40:02.468 --> 01:40:03.926
I got busted, damn it!

1119
01:40:03.926 --> 01:40:05.843
They've turned me into an animal.

1120
01:40:05.843 --> 01:40:07.176
They took turns to do me...

1121
01:40:07.343 --> 01:40:09.676
Sometimes all motherfuckers together.

1122
01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:13.093
Do you know what
I've been through, loser?


1123
01:40:13.093 --> 01:40:14.676
Do you know? Do you?

1124
01:40:22.176 --> 01:40:25.801
Besides this,
everything else.


1125
01:40:26.968 --> 01:40:28.301
Do you understand?

1126
01:40:37.676 --> 01:40:38.885
Let's leave.

1127
01:41:02.343 --> 01:41:09.676
There's this big billboard
I can see from the window


1128
01:41:12.926 --> 01:41:17.426
An ad for a Goa holiday.

1129
01:41:21.593 --> 01:41:25.176
That's all I keep staring at
all the time, without a blink.


1130
01:41:26.968 --> 01:41:30.801
Because I believe that,
that is my 'good time'.


1131
01:41:32.093 --> 01:41:35.551
And that day will come.

1132
01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:38.051
And when it does, 
I will ask it.

1133
01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:42.135
Where were you all this while?

1134
01:41:42.593 --> 01:41:45.926
Waiting for me to be decimated?

1135
01:41:45.926 --> 01:41:47.885
Is that what it
takes for you to come?

1136
01:41:48.468 --> 01:41:51.218
But here I am and
I refuse to fall apart!


1137
01:41:51.218 --> 01:41:54.551
I am standing right here!

1138
01:42:03.468 --> 01:42:05.051
Still waiting.

1139
01:42:11.468 --> 01:42:15.010
Your Punjab failed me, loser!

1140
01:42:17.676 --> 01:42:20.176
I've never touched a cigarette.

1141
01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:23.551
And now I'm hooked to the needle.

1142
01:42:27.218 --> 01:42:29.135
Why don't you quit it?

1143
01:42:32.676 --> 01:42:33.885
What?

1144
01:42:35.218 --> 01:42:36.551
Punjab?

1145
01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:39.426
Or the needle?

1146
01:42:40.468 --> 01:42:42.135
What is your name?

1147
01:43:35.843 --> 01:43:37.051
Sartaj?

1148
01:44:27.176 --> 01:44:31.176
Punjab police filed a case against Tommy
Singh for lewd and Lascivious behaviour.


1149
01:44:31.343 --> 01:44:35.426
The court has issued a non-bailable
warrant against Tommy Singh.


1150
01:44:35.426 --> 01:44:37.676
The Punjab government
has condemned this...


1151
01:44:37.843 --> 01:44:41.135
and has asked for Tommy's
immediate arrest.


1152
01:44:41.926 --> 01:44:45.301
Forgive her.
- I'm going to kill the bitch!


1153
01:44:45.468 --> 01:44:47.135
If the boss found out...

1154
01:44:47.426 --> 01:44:49.051
No. I will talk to her.

1155
01:44:49.218 --> 01:44:50.676
Please forgive her.

1156
01:44:50.843 --> 01:44:51.718
Brother...

1157
01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.093
Relax, let me handle it.

1158
01:44:53.093 --> 01:44:54.801
What is left of her anyway?

1159
01:44:55.468 --> 01:44:57.843
She's a chewed out bone.
Let's chop and throw her.


1160
01:44:57.843 --> 01:44:59.801
No. Let me talk to her.

1161
01:44:59.801 --> 01:45:03.385
Assure them you won't do it again.

1162
01:45:03.551 --> 01:45:04.551
<i>She won't.</i>

1163
01:45:04.718 --> 01:45:06.926
Bunch of sister fuckers!

1164
01:45:08.176 --> 01:45:10.051
Keep her under control.

1165
01:45:27.301 --> 01:45:29.051
I am really mad at you.

1166
01:45:31.093 --> 01:45:32.968
Baby, understand.

1167
01:45:32.968 --> 01:45:34.676
You can't manage
on your own.


1168
01:45:35.593 --> 01:45:37.385
Do you know how
expensive heroin is?


1169
01:45:38.593 --> 01:45:40.801
You'll have to sleep with
someone for money.


1170
01:45:41.093 --> 01:45:42.801
Will you like that?

1171
01:45:43.968 --> 01:45:46.301
They're only going to use you.

1172
01:45:48.593 --> 01:45:52.010
But, Sonu loves you, baby.

1173
01:45:53.593 --> 01:45:55.385
Baby...

1174
01:45:58.718 --> 01:46:02.385
Don't run away again. Okay?

1175
01:46:17.176 --> 01:46:18.051
Sartaj!

1176
01:46:19.176 --> 01:46:19.885
Come here!

1177
01:46:20.926 --> 01:46:21.551
<i>Look.</i>

1178
01:46:23.301 --> 01:46:25.301
Some Virender Singh
is behind all this.


1179
01:46:25.593 --> 01:46:26.926
The owner of Deluxe Pharmaceuticals.

1180
01:46:28.176 --> 01:46:30.301
Deluxe Pharmaceuticals is
the front in whose name...


1181
01:46:30.468 --> 01:46:32.676
government controlled
opium is being sourced.


1182
01:46:33.343 --> 01:46:34.385
It's a fake company.

1183
01:46:34.593 --> 01:46:36.260
There is nothing about it online.

1184
01:46:36.468 --> 01:46:38.426
The telephone numbers
also don't work.


1185
01:46:39.093 --> 01:46:40.551
But guess what I did?

1186
01:46:41.343 --> 01:46:43.593
I logged on to Registrar of
Companies website


1187
01:46:43.593 --> 01:46:45.135
and found out owner details.

1188
01:46:46.093 --> 01:46:48.676
It's some Virender Singh
from village Havelian.


1189
01:46:49.468 --> 01:46:50.635
Who is this Virender Singh?

1190
01:46:52.593 --> 01:46:54.926
I thought the owner would
be a big politician.


1191
01:46:55.468 --> 01:46:56.551
I don't know.

1192
01:46:57.218 --> 01:47:00.176
Could be a political stooge.

1193
01:47:08.593 --> 01:47:09.676
Madam...

1194
01:47:12.176 --> 01:47:14.176
Last night...

1195
01:47:14.968 --> 01:47:16.176
Are you okay now?

1196
01:47:16.176 --> 01:47:18.051
Balli, stop.

1197
01:47:23.176 --> 01:47:25.426
Let me go.
- Wait.


1198
01:47:27.593 --> 01:47:29.801
Chetan, hold him.

1199
01:47:29.968 --> 01:47:32.301
Balli, listen...

1200
01:47:41.343 --> 01:47:43.051
Thorazine, quick!

1201
01:47:43.051 --> 01:47:44.426
Balli?

1202
01:47:58.468 --> 01:48:00.301
Stop. Drop me here.

1203
01:48:12.301 --> 01:48:14.843
On Radio Bollywood,
I am your RJ Manveer.


1204
01:48:14.843 --> 01:48:19.301
It's 9 AM. Tommy Singh's been
absconding for the past 12 hours.


1205
01:48:19.676 --> 01:48:20.551
<i>Bro, Tommy'.!</i>

1206
01:48:21.218 --> 01:48:23.051
What's going on, brother?

1207
01:48:26.218 --> 01:48:28.301
Tommy, you have any idea...

1208
01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:36.926
I have lots to tell you.

1209
01:48:37.093 --> 01:48:37.676
What happened?

1210
01:48:37.676 --> 01:48:38.926
Come with me.
- What happened?


1211
01:48:39.218 --> 01:48:40.676
Sit down.

1212
01:48:41.093 --> 01:48:42.801
First let's check into a hotel.

1213
01:48:42.801 --> 01:48:45.093
I have to freshen up.

1214
01:48:45.093 --> 01:48:47.968
I haven't eaten since last night.

1215
01:48:47.968 --> 01:48:51.051
And there's this girl
that I have to save.


1216
01:48:52.968 --> 01:48:55.926
For once think of someone
other than yourself, asshole!


1217
01:48:56.176 --> 01:48:59.468
Do you know where my dad is, Tommy?

1218
01:48:59.468 --> 01:49:01.176
They've put him in jail.

1219
01:49:01.551 --> 01:49:05.218
The police must be beating him
asking him where Tommy is.


1220
01:49:05.218 --> 01:49:06.676
If it were up to me, Tommy...

1221
01:49:06.676 --> 01:49:09.426
I'd hand you over
to the police myself.


1222
01:49:11.593 --> 01:49:15.635
But you do as you please,
you're on your own now.


1223
01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:18.343
And forgive me.

1224
01:49:18.343 --> 01:49:20.926
Jassi, listen.
- I don't want to listen.


1225
01:49:20.926 --> 01:49:22.218
It's not what you think.

1226
01:49:22.218 --> 01:49:26.218
The girl's in deep trouble,
some heroin mafia shit.


1227
01:49:26.218 --> 01:49:28.301
We need some money
to get her released.


1228
01:49:28.468 --> 01:49:31.676
After that I will do
whatever you ask...


1229
01:49:32.051 --> 01:49:33.051
Surrender.

1230
01:49:34.718 --> 01:49:36.010
You were my hero.

1231
01:49:36.468 --> 01:49:39.218
When you came from London,
I danced with joy.


1232
01:49:39.218 --> 01:49:40.635
'My cool cousin!'
'My cool cousin!'


1233
01:49:41.093 --> 01:49:43.051
Sisterfucker!
Now just look at this 'cool cousin'.


1234
01:49:44.093 --> 01:49:45.260
GABRU's crew tee.

1235
01:49:46.468 --> 01:49:48.176
I used to wear it with pride.

1236
01:49:53.093 --> 01:49:55.260
To hell with it, sisterfucker!

1237
01:49:56.468 --> 01:49:57.301
Jassi.

1238
01:49:57.301 --> 01:50:00.135
There's no love in your heart,
only cocaine.


1239
01:50:00.718 --> 01:50:02.051
Remember that, f****r!

1240
01:50:02.218 --> 01:50:03.801
Listen up.
- Jassi is dead.


1241
01:50:03.801 --> 01:50:04.635
Your uncle is dead.

1242
01:50:04.926 --> 01:50:06.926
It's not what you think.

1243
01:50:07.093 --> 01:50:08.885
We have to save her!

1244
01:50:23.343 --> 01:50:25.551
Sometimes I get high
with just your touch.


1245
01:50:30.968 --> 01:50:35.885
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>


1246
01:50:36.176 --> 01:50:41.010
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>


1247
01:50:41.343 --> 01:50:44.093
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder</i>


1248
01:50:44.093 --> 01:50:46.385
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>

1249
01:50:46.593 --> 01:50:48.801
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder,</i>


1250
01:50:48.968 --> 01:50:51.301
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>

1251
01:50:55.801 --> 01:50:57.885
Sir, we've reached Sarhota.

1252
01:50:58.093 --> 01:51:00.176
Is this Sarhota?
- Yes.


1253
01:51:11.718 --> 01:51:14.051
There this girl, from your village.

1254
01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:15.385
Which block?

1255
01:51:16.093 --> 01:51:17.176
Don't know.

1256
01:51:18.301 --> 01:51:19.301
Name?

1257
01:51:19.593 --> 01:51:20.635
Don't know that either.

1258
01:51:21.843 --> 01:51:24.051
Idiots get me riled,
early in the morning!


1259
01:51:25.343 --> 01:51:27.093
She may be from Bihar.

1260
01:51:27.093 --> 01:51:28.801
From Bihar?

1261
01:51:29.968 --> 01:51:34.676
Maybe at Karnail Singh's fields?
Lot of women from Bihar work there.


1262
01:51:36.301 --> 01:51:37.676
She ran away.

1263
01:51:38.218 --> 01:51:39.885
Didn't <i>even</i> take her stuff along.

1264
01:51:40.468 --> 01:51:42.676
Who did she go with?

1265
01:51:43.093 --> 01:51:44.051
Do you know anything?

1266
01:51:44.926 --> 01:51:46.593
No idea, sir.

1267
01:51:46.593 --> 01:51:48.885
She was the silent type.

1268
01:51:49.093 --> 01:51:50.676
Her name?

1269
01:51:51.343 --> 01:51:53.301
She had a strange name.

1270
01:51:54.426 --> 01:51:57.301
Pushpa, what was
the hockey girl's name?


1271
01:51:57.468 --> 01:52:00.676
What do I know?
I used to call her 'birdbrain'.


1272
01:52:27.593 --> 01:52:30.426
Who is the dealer over here?

1273
01:52:31.468 --> 01:52:32.551
Tell me, you fucker!

1274
01:52:34.051 --> 01:52:38.801
You can take some
from me if you want.

1275
01:52:38.801 --> 01:52:42.051
Supply is down.

1276
01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:43.551
Cut it out!!

1277
01:52:46.968 --> 01:52:48.301
What happened?

1278
01:52:49.093 --> 01:52:52.301
Our dealer,
Bhandi, is in the hospital.


1279
01:52:53.593 --> 01:52:57.926
His gang beat him
up over a bad deal.

1280
01:52:59.718 --> 01:53:02.635
Okay then, have a nice day!

1281
01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:06.385
Holy shit! Doesn't he
look just like Tommy?


1282
01:53:06.676 --> 01:53:08.760
Yeah, bro!

1283
01:53:09.218 --> 01:53:11.051
[GABRU]

1284
01:53:39.176 --> 01:53:43.260
Why would an MD of a pharma
company live here?


1285
01:53:44.593 --> 01:53:46.426
You listening?

1286
01:53:46.593 --> 01:53:47.551
Praise the lord!

1287
01:53:54.593 --> 01:53:55.801
That's a nice house.

1288
01:53:55.968 --> 01:53:57.760
Grace of God.

1289
01:53:59.468 --> 01:54:01.426
Mobiles don't work in our village.

1290
01:54:01.718 --> 01:54:03.760
But I have a phone at home.

1291
01:54:04.301 --> 01:54:07.468
You can speak to Virender
if you want


1292
01:54:07.468 --> 01:54:08.510
No, that's fine.

1293
01:54:08.718 --> 01:54:11.051
Since we were around,
we thought we'd say hello.


1294
01:54:11.051 --> 01:54:12.176
It's been a while.

1295
01:54:13.468 --> 01:54:14.760
What's he up to these days?

1296
01:54:14.968 --> 01:54:16.843
Same. Driving.

1297
01:54:16.843 --> 01:54:18.093
Private car?

1298
01:54:18.093 --> 01:54:22.176
Yes. With Amar Pal Singh.

1299
01:54:26.093 --> 01:54:29.051
Mr. Brar's son-in-law.

1300
01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:31.343
Maninder Brar?

1301
01:54:31.343 --> 01:54:32.593
Yes.

1302
01:54:32.593 --> 01:54:34.593
I remember.

1303
01:54:34.593 --> 01:54:37.301
Virender had mentioned
that they are like family


1304
01:54:37.968 --> 01:54:40.260
Hey, get the family album.

1305
01:54:47.468 --> 01:54:52.551
Mr. Brar's entire family had danced
at my son's wedding.


1306
01:54:54.343 --> 01:54:56.635
There was so much pomp.

1307
01:54:58.926 --> 01:55:00.301
Virender is looking so good.

1308
01:55:00.468 --> 01:55:01.551
Of course.

1309
01:55:02.468 --> 01:55:03.510
We must be going.

1310
01:55:34.218 --> 01:55:36.051
Left from here.
- Yes.


1311
01:55:38.093 --> 01:55:39.551
Oh no.

1312
01:55:43.843 --> 01:55:45.051
What happened?

1313
01:55:46.051 --> 01:55:47.676
Police.

1314
01:55:58.718 --> 01:55:59.676
Greetings.

1315
01:55:59.676 --> 01:56:00.926
What is it?

1316
01:56:01.468 --> 01:56:03.093
How is everything?
- All good.


1317
01:56:03.093 --> 01:56:05.176
I was saying...

1318
01:56:05.176 --> 01:56:07.718
Get out of here, bloody junkies!

1319
01:56:07.718 --> 01:56:08.468
Get lost!

1320
01:56:08.468 --> 01:56:10.051
Relax, will you.

1321
01:56:10.218 --> 01:56:11.301
What happened to the boy?

1322
01:56:11.468 --> 01:56:15.426
I think he's got an attack.

1323
01:56:21.343 --> 01:56:23.801
Doctor!

1324
01:56:33.551 --> 01:56:35.676
Don't hit me more.

1325
01:56:35.676 --> 01:56:37.926
No. Don't worry. Be quiet.

1326
01:56:38.176 --> 01:56:39.885
I am your brother.

1327
01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:43.301
Your brother's been beaten
to pulp, my man.


1328
01:56:43.468 --> 01:56:45.051
I know, bro. I know.

1329
01:56:45.218 --> 01:56:46.676
But there this girl.

1330
01:56:46.676 --> 01:56:49.718
Fuckers fed me to Jackie.

1331
01:56:49.718 --> 01:56:51.176
Listen to me.

1332
01:56:51.176 --> 01:56:53.218
Fucker, chewed out my bones.

1333
01:56:53.218 --> 01:56:54.176
Bloody listen!

1334
01:56:54.176 --> 01:56:57.801
This girl from Bihar who is in
trouble with the heroin mafia.


1335
01:56:57.968 --> 01:57:00.635
It's very important that I meet her.

1336
01:57:00.968 --> 01:57:04.676
I've never done anything for anyone.

1337
01:57:04.676 --> 01:57:06.885
Let me do this once.

1338
01:57:07.093 --> 01:57:08.051
It'll set me free.

1339
01:57:12.593 --> 01:57:16.301
Sorry. Listen to me.

1340
01:57:16.468 --> 01:57:17.551
Listen to me.

1341
01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:21.926
After a long time,
there's a tune in my head.


1342
01:57:23.218 --> 01:57:25.426
And it is thanks to the girl.

1343
01:57:26.051 --> 01:57:28.635
Ever since I've met her,

1344
01:57:29.093 --> 01:57:31.551
I just don't feel like taking cocaine.

1345
01:57:32.176 --> 01:57:35.218
I've got my 'mojo' back.

1346
01:57:35.218 --> 01:57:38.176
You know mojo, man. It's back!

1347
01:57:39.593 --> 01:57:40.801
Tommy?
- Yes.


1348
01:57:40.968 --> 01:57:41.551
Tommy.

1349
01:57:41.718 --> 01:57:43.426
Dude.

1350
01:57:43.426 --> 01:57:44.551
Where is the girl?
- THE Tommy.


1351
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.635
Where is the girl?

1352
01:57:48.593 --> 01:57:49.426
Sing me a song.

1353
01:57:49.593 --> 01:57:50.676
Just one song.
- Who is inside?


1354
01:57:50.676 --> 01:57:51.843
I can't sing here.

1355
01:57:51.843 --> 01:57:53.635
It'll make me feel lot better.

1356
01:57:54.968 --> 01:57:55.551
Tell me.

1357
01:57:55.718 --> 01:57:57.260
Sing-
. okay-


1358
01:57:58.593 --> 01:58:00.093
You'll have to tell me then!

1359
01:58:00.093 --> 01:58:01.260
Sure.

1360
01:58:02.093 --> 01:58:04.260
Just one song!
- Okay, calm down!


1361
01:58:07.468 --> 01:58:15.551
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1362
01:58:16.593 --> 01:58:25.176
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1363
01:58:27.093 --> 01:58:35.010
<i>Her saintly charm,
her sublime beauty.</i>


1364
01:58:35.426 --> 01:58:43.510
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1365
01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:53.176
Her face is ethereal,

01:58:53.593 --> 01:59:00.760
<i>Warmth, like Mary's embrace.</i>

1367
01:59:01.343 --> 01:59:03.051
Sultanpura.

1368
01:59:04.093 --> 01:59:05.093
What?

1369
01:59:05.093 --> 01:59:06.885
Sultanpura.

1370
01:59:13.343 --> 01:59:15.093
Catch him.

1371
01:59:15.093 --> 01:59:17.051
Don't let him get away.

1372
01:59:17.051 --> 01:59:18.260
I won't spare you today.

1373
01:59:31.468 --> 01:59:38.260
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

<i>Warmth, like Mary's embrace</i>

1382
02:00:42.718 --> 02:00:50.260
Her smile makes the flowers bloom.

1383
02:00:50.593 --> 02:00:58.385
<i>Her gait feels like a moving sonnet.</i>

1384
02:00:59.093 --> 02:01:06.010
<i>Tall as a cypress in winter,</i>

Yet she knows what the eyes speak.

02:02:41.093 --> 02:02:42.176
Done?

1395
02:02:54.551 --> 02:02:56.051
So, Chandigarh tomorrow at seven?

1396
02:02:56.676 --> 02:02:57.426
Yes.

1397
02:02:58.968 --> 02:03:00.926
Let's give the Election commission
a couple of days.


1398
02:03:01.176 --> 02:03:03.926
If nothing happens,
we will approach the media.


1399
02:03:04.218 --> 02:03:05.926
But I am sure, it'll work out.

1400
02:03:08.093 --> 02:03:09.551
Thank you, madam.

1401
02:03:11.218 --> 02:03:14.135
Whenever <i>I'll</i> look into the
mirror to tie my turban...


1402
02:03:15.176 --> 02:03:17.260
I'll feel a little less ashamed.

1403
02:03:24.301 --> 02:03:26.260
Okay... ta ta!

1404
02:03:34.468 --> 02:03:36.635
Madam, I've been wanting
to say something


1405
02:03:36.843 --> 02:03:38.051
I messed it up that evening.

1406
02:03:39.093 --> 02:03:41.926
The thing is that... you are so...

1407
02:03:44.968 --> 02:03:46.801
You are so perfect that...

1408
02:03:50.218 --> 02:03:51.676
Ta ta!

1409
02:04:03.718 --> 02:04:08.551
Sartaj. Sartaj, wait up.

1410
02:04:13.468 --> 02:04:15.926
Tomorrow when we're done...

1411
02:04:16.093 --> 02:04:17.801
do you want to have coffee with me?

1412
02:04:19.468 --> 02:04:20.676
At a cafe?

1413
02:04:22.926 --> 02:04:24.551
You came all the way
to ask me this?


1414
02:04:25.218 --> 02:04:26.176
Yes.

1415
02:04:30.176 --> 02:04:31.010
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
02:04:31.843 --> 02:04:32.801
Okay?

1417
02:05:13.843 --> 02:05:15.385
What happened, kiddo?

1418
02:05:15.676 --> 02:05:18.051
The water is over. I am thirsty.

1419
02:05:18.218 --> 02:05:20.760
Thirsty? What did you
have for dinner?


1420
02:05:21.551 --> 02:05:23.635
Give me your jug.

1421
02:05:23.926 --> 02:05:25.426
Where are you?

1422
02:05:31.343 --> 02:05:32.676
Give it to me.

1423
02:05:32.843 --> 02:05:34.385
This is not a toy.

1424
02:05:35.093 --> 02:05:36.301
This is not a toy.

1425
02:05:36.968 --> 02:05:38.426
Some one will get hurt.

1426
02:05:39.093 --> 02:05:40.426
Give it to me.

1427
02:06:10.843 --> 02:06:15.926
Everything okay?

1428
02:06:18.718 --> 02:06:22.801
Kiddo, let's go in.

1429
02:06:26.468 --> 02:06:28.926
Listen to me, Balli.

1430
02:06:32.426 --> 02:06:38.010
Let me go.
- Balli, wait!


1431
02:08:17.676 --> 02:08:20.551
Motherfucker! Were you
warming your balls here?


1432
02:08:28.468 --> 02:08:30.051
You haven't told anyone, right?

1433
02:08:30.218 --> 02:08:31.676
How can you say that, sir?

1434
02:08:31.676 --> 02:08:33.176
Your cousin is my cousin.

1435
02:09:00.593 --> 02:09:02.885
It's okay... Don't stress.

1436
02:09:04.218 --> 02:09:05.676
Your brother, Jujhar is here.

1437
02:09:06.843 --> 02:09:08.676
There's a safe-house in Sultanpura.

1438
02:09:09.801 --> 02:09:11.676
Go underground there for some time.

1439
02:09:13.926 --> 02:09:15.551
Don't lose hope.

1440
02:09:16.926 --> 02:09:17.676
Alright?

1441
02:09:18.968 --> 02:09:20.010
Nopi.

1442
02:09:21.676 --> 02:09:22.218
Sir.

1443
02:09:22.218 --> 02:09:24.051
Take him to the safe-house.

1444
02:09:24.426 --> 02:09:25.426
I'll inform them.

1445
02:09:25.426 --> 02:09:26.260
Okay, let's go.

1446
02:09:50.968 --> 02:09:52.301
Hold her head.

1447
02:09:54.718 --> 02:09:56.301
Come on.

1448
02:09:56.468 --> 02:09:58.135
Switch on the light.
- Yes sir.


1449
02:09:58.343 --> 02:09:59.676
I'll create a crime scene here.

1450
02:09:59.843 --> 02:10:02.426
You wash the blood outside. Quick!

1451
02:10:20.426 --> 02:10:21.926
Where are you?

1452
02:10:22.093 --> 02:10:23.926
Sorry, I was riding.

1453
02:10:25.343 --> 02:10:25.926
- What happened?

1454
02:10:26.176 --> 02:10:27.426
Come to the clinic.

1455
02:10:27.593 --> 02:10:29.176
Balli has created a mess.

1456
02:11:07.551 --> 02:11:09.385
Motherfucker!

1457
02:11:26.218 --> 02:11:29.010
Be careful. The floor is wet.

1458
02:12:11.093 --> 02:12:12.426
Motherfucker!

1459
02:14:07.093 --> 02:14:16.051
Today, a large number of Punjab youth
is in drug addiction.


1460
02:14:16.218 --> 02:14:22.385
Many house have
at least one drug addict.


1461
02:14:23.468 --> 02:14:32.676
Sir, if this vicious narco-politics
is not stopped,


1462
02:14:33.218 --> 02:14:37.051
Punjab will soon become like Mexico.

1463
02:14:38.093 --> 02:14:40.926
I hear that Mexican
girls are really hot.


1464
02:14:41.093 --> 02:14:43.801
J Lo... Jennifer Lopez.

1465
02:14:43.968 --> 02:14:47.051
Such a derriere can be found only
in Mexico, or in Punjab.


1466
02:14:47.218 --> 02:14:48.635
Really?
- Isn't it?


1467
02:14:52.176 --> 02:14:53.176
<i>Fucker.</i> I

1468
02:14:57.843 --> 02:15:03.051
You should've at least kept
my name out of the list.


1469
02:15:05.343 --> 02:15:06.551
Mine's there, too.

1470
02:15:08.551 --> 02:15:12.301
As kid brothers, we weren't shy to
even show each others' dicks.


1471
02:15:14.343 --> 02:15:18.135
I got you this job.
I helped you keep it too.


1472
02:15:19.968 --> 02:15:21.926
And you betrayed me for that bitch?

1473
02:15:24.968 --> 02:15:26.510
It's not about you or me.

1474
02:15:27.801 --> 02:15:28.801
Then who is it about?

1475
02:15:31.218 --> 02:15:32.051
Punjab.

1476
02:15:32.593 --> 02:15:35.260
Fucker, you think
Punjab belongs to your daddy?


1477
02:15:38.301 --> 02:15:39.885
Motherfucker!

1478
02:15:40.676 --> 02:15:41.635
Son...

1479
02:15:42.593 --> 02:15:44.176
Too late to save now...

1480
02:15:45.343 --> 02:15:48.551
Lands are dry and kids are high.

1481
02:16:15.343 --> 02:16:17.051
Good morning, baby.

1482
02:16:17.426 --> 02:16:18.801
Bed tea for...

1483
02:16:19.218 --> 02:16:20.635
What are you doing?

1484
02:17:51.968 --> 02:17:53.426
Don't shoot.

1485
02:19:43.676 --> 02:19:44.301
There's a dog there.

1486
02:19:44.468 --> 02:19:45.635
Come this way.

1487
02:19:47.843 --> 02:19:48.551
Be careful.

1488
02:20:07.676 --> 02:20:10.135
Hey you... Girl!

1489
02:20:10.968 --> 02:20:12.926
At least tell me your name.

1490
02:21:19.343 --> 02:21:21.635
Is the Sultanpura massacre
leading to a can of worms?


1491
02:21:21.801 --> 02:21:23.051
What's in that file at crime scene...

1492
02:21:23.218 --> 02:21:26.301
that's got Punjab government
to swing into action?


1493
02:21:26.468 --> 02:21:30.426
An Inquiry Committee has
been set up against MP Brar.


1494
02:21:30.426 --> 02:21:37.385
I beg the media not to drag
my family in this matter.


1495
02:21:37.926 --> 02:21:39.926
Why speculate the
involvement of my family?


1496
02:21:40.218 --> 02:21:43.010
Sir... Sir!

1497
02:21:44.468 --> 02:21:46.718
Tommy, how are you?

1498
02:21:46.718 --> 02:21:49.676
Let it be.
You don't miss me.


1499
02:21:50.593 --> 02:21:51.676
You are busy in jail, too?

1500
02:21:51.843 --> 02:21:59.926
<i>'The weather is crazy today.'</i>

1501
02:22:00.843 --> 02:22:05.843
What is this green stuff?

1502
02:22:05.843 --> 02:22:07.801
Get me some buttermilk.

1503
02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:19.176
I don't understand her, too.

1504
02:22:19.176 --> 02:22:21.551
Remember,
a brother before a lover. Okay?


1505
02:22:23.176 --> 02:22:24.551
He is asking your name.

1506
02:22:34.468 --> 02:22:35.926
Mary Jane.

1507
02:22:36.093 --> 02:22:37.676
Eh?

1508
02:22:37.676 --> 02:22:39.093
As in, my beloved?

1509
02:22:39.093 --> 02:22:41.926
You guys!
Her name is Mary Jane.


1510
02:22:41.926 --> 02:22:44.510
Not your Jane.
My Jane, my Mary Jane.


1511
02:22:44.801 --> 02:22:46.301
Mary Jane, my beloved!

1512
02:22:46.593 --> 02:22:48.551
Mary Jane, my beloved!

1513
02:22:52.301 --> 02:22:53.051
Spoke to her?

1514
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:20.593
<i>Born along the blessed five rivers</i>

1515
02:24:20.593 --> 02:24:25.801
<i>Bred in this soil, our motherland.</i>

1516
02:24:25.801 --> 02:24:31.885
<i>Brother, now don't sing out of tune</i>

1517
02:24:32.093 --> 02:24:37.010
<i>God is watching over us from above.</i>

1518
02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:41.176
<i>But us earthlings are lost
In our own trance.</i>


1519
02:24:41.468 --> 02:24:46.176
<i>So question your conscience.</i>

1520
02:24:46.593 --> 02:24:51.510
<i>Peep in the mirror within.</i>

1521
02:24:51.926 --> 02:24:56.801
<i>Know this, the eternal truth:</i>

1522
02:24:57.093 --> 02:25:03.551
<i>His divinity is in every being.</i>

1523
02:25:03.843 --> 02:25:07.260
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1524
02:25:09.093 --> 02:25:12.551
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1525
02:25:14.301 --> 02:25:17.676
It's the essence of our existence.

1526
02:25:19.551 --> 02:25:23.551
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1527
02:25:44.926 --> 02:25:47.426
<i>Watch over yourselves.</i>

1528
02:25:47.593 --> 02:25:50.010
<i>Look for the path of righteousness.</i>

1529
02:25:50.218 --> 02:25:55.176
<i>Beloved mother is
waiting with open arms</i>


1530
02:25:55.343 --> 02:25:58.093
<i>Let's ward off the
evil that hurts our land.</i>


1531
02:25:58.093 --> 02:26:00.676
<i>Let's exorcise this demon.</i>

1532
02:26:01.218 --> 02:26:05.010
<i>Come back home, now!</i>

1533
02:26:06.218 --> 02:26:11.176
<i>Don't let these tears turn you weak.</i>

1534
02:26:11.343 --> 02:26:15.010
<i>A promise you owe to your land.</i>

1535
02:26:15.343 --> 02:26:20.135
<i>So question your conscience.</i>

1536
02:26:20.426 --> 02:26:25.135
<i>Peep in the mirror within.</i>

1537
02:26:25.718 --> 02:26:30.760
<i>Know this, the eternal truth:</i>

1538
02:26:30.968 --> 02:26:37.010
<i>His divinity is in every being.</i>

1539
02:26:37.843 --> 02:26:41.135
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1540
02:26:43.051 --> 02:26:46.301
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1541
02:26:48.218 --> 02:26:51.551
It's the essence of our existence.

1542
02:26:53.468 --> 02:26:56.551
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>
