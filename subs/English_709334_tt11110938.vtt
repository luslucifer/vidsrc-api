00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:58.753
Well, well. What do we got here?

3
00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:03.524
You, uh, runnin' late
for the boneyard, mister?


4
00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:12.133
Yeah, well,

5
00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.368
I can see you're a little...

6
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.771
a little filled up here
right now.


7
00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:19.040
I don't think you'd mind me
taking a peek


8
00:04:19.174 --> 00:04:22.244
at the dearly departed,
now, would you?


9
00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:26.413
You see, it could be
some family treasures in there


10
00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:29.184
I'll be interested in.

11
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.721
Now, you just be still,
you goofy old son of a bitch.


12
00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:42.998
Fitch.

13
00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.584
You think you can
waltz on in here,


14
00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.088
kill all my men? Shut up!

15
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:41.488
Take my whore?

16
00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.457
Chickenshit.

17
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.160
What you gonna do, No Name?

18
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:48.595
Yeah. A chickenshit, Deuce.
That's what you are.


19
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.597
Let the female go.

20
00:05:50.732 --> 00:05:52.434
Oh, like hell I will.

21
00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.670
Like hell I will, motherfucker.

22
00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:59.506
Oh! Fuckin' shot me in my toe!
Fuckin'...


23
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:05.180
Hmm.

24
00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:11.853
Hi.

25
00:06:11.987 --> 00:06:14.089
I'm gonna get you untied.

26
00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:15.890
I'm gonna untie you.

27
00:06:16.024 --> 00:06:17.524
I'm gonna untie you.

28
00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:18.893
Calm down.

29
00:06:19.027 --> 00:06:21.796
I'm gonna untie you.

30
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.399
Okay? Just let me untie you.

31
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.202
Put you on a horse.

32
00:06:52.127 --> 00:06:53.560
Aw.

33
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.433
That's for leaving me
with the hotel bill in Denver.


34
00:06:58.565 --> 00:06:59.834
That hurt.

35
00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.636
But thanks for the help
with that pervert.


36
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.572
I'll be seeing you, No Name.
Come on!


37
00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:28.063
What did they used
to call you down in Mexico?


38
00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:28.897
Slimy.

39
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.865
Slimy. Goddamn.

40
00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:32.967
Slimy Murdock,
they called me.


41
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.336
Can you go back into Mexico?

42
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.339
They won't let me back there,
but I've snuck in a time or two.


43
00:07:38.473 --> 00:07:40.574
Yeah, you better watch out.
They'll hang you.


44
00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:42.343
Whatever happened
to that old gal you dated?


45
00:07:42.477 --> 00:07:43.745
That Dirty Lou you called her.

46
00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:45.513
- Dirty Lou?
- Yeah.


47
00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:47.215
Well, she was a little dirty,

48
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:50.452
but she wasn't like
that fish lady thing you had.


49
00:07:52.654 --> 00:07:54.422
Yeah, but she was sweet.
I loved her.


50
00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:58.126
Oh, yeah. Looked like a frog
going across a tree.


51
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.362
I wanna know what was the name
of that damn...


52
00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.531
- The Union of...
- The Arab Masa.


53
00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:05.700
The Union Trust Bank.

54
00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:07.102
- Well, Angus...
- Yeah.


55
00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:10.305
...what do you think
we got out of this deal?


56
00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:13.908
Well, I know we got

57
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:15.743
- Now, we, uh...
- Holy shit.


58
00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:18.246
You greasy bastard,
you can't even count.


59
00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:20.215
Uh, bullshit.

60
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:21.816
Let's play the cards,
for Christ's sake.


61
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.351
Deal those cards, will ya? Here.

62
00:08:41.803 --> 00:08:43.938
Excuse me, gentlemen.

63
00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:46.341
Do you have any water?

64
00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:53.047
Hold it right there, partner.

65
00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:55.984
No need for violence.

66
00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:59.154
I dare say I'm unarmed.

67
00:08:59.287 --> 00:09:01.289
I sell candles.

68
00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:06.361
And all I want
is a drink of water.


69
00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:17.071
You see, I've been traveling
all about selling my wares,


70
00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:19.374
and I'm completely parched.

71
00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:23.144
I would go as far as to say

72
00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:26.848
I will give each of you
a free candle


73
00:09:26.981 --> 00:09:29.117
for a drink of water.

74
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.085
Go get him some water, Mack.

75
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.198
Thank you.

76
00:09:54.108 --> 00:09:57.879
Now, pick up your shit and
get back to the railroad, boy.


77
00:09:59.314 --> 00:10:00.548
Sure.

78
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.417
No problem.

79
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.319
And thanks again.

80
00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:08.624
Hey, China boy.

81
00:10:08.756 --> 00:10:11.259
Leave the candles with us.

82
00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:16.130
Leave all my candles?

83
00:10:16.264 --> 00:10:19.702
You heard him.
Leave the candles.


84
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:50.231
Now, why would I do that?

85
00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:52.533
Why?

86
00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:54.168
'Cause if you don't,

87
00:10:54.302 --> 00:10:56.371
I'ma blow a second hole
right in your ass.


88
00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:01.042
- Yeah.
- Second hole.


89
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:23.965
I see.

90
00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:27.201
You made your point quite clear,
I might add.


91
00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:49.324
Well, it's been nice
making your acquaintance.


92
00:13:04.932 --> 00:13:07.001
Where are they?

93
00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:15.510
They're worth more alive.

94
00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:20.548
True.

95
00:13:20.682 --> 00:13:22.785
Well, when they're alive,

96
00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:24.853
for some reason,

97
00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:26.954
they want revenge.

98
00:13:27.088 --> 00:13:29.457
It's easier to get rid of 'em.

99
00:13:31.993 --> 00:13:34.362
I love peanuts.

100
00:13:34.495 --> 00:13:37.833
Hey, barkeep,
do you have those, uh...


101
00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:39.100
You know,
the ones that are cooked?


102
00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:40.636
- <i>Qué?</i>
- The peanuts.


103
00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:42.738
The new ones.
The cooked peanuts.


104
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:44.807
They're called roasted peanuts.

105
00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:47.175
Oh, no, Señor Dynamite.

106
00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:49.444
I don't have any of those.

107
00:13:49.577 --> 00:13:52.113
Actually, I've never heard
of those roasted peanuts.


108
00:13:52.246 --> 00:13:53.481
What are those?

109
00:13:53.614 --> 00:13:56.819
- The cooked ones.
- They're roasted peanuts.


110
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.822
- Cooked.
- They're roasted peanuts.


111
00:14:02.023 --> 00:14:03.458
Compadre.

112
00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.629
You seen him?

113
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.799
- This guy.
- No. Never in my life.


114
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.266
Listen, mister.

115
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.838
You looking for trouble?
You just found it.


116
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.306
Okay. Tell me right now.
Where is he?


117
00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:21.442
In the church. It's around
the corner. You can't miss it.


118
00:14:21.576 --> 00:14:24.479
- How many?
- Four or five.


119
00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:26.214
Maybe. I think.

120
00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:27.615
Do you think four?
Do you think five?


121
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:30.485
Five or four.
<i>Cuatro, cinco.</i>


122
00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:33.287
You're not as stupid
as you look.


123
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.632
Let's go.

124
00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:30.411
I want you to get me
another bottle of whiskey now.


125
00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:33.147
I don't want you
to bring me that piss


126
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:35.249
that you serve
to the Mexicans.


127
00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:38.119
You understanding me?

128
00:15:38.252 --> 00:15:40.087
Now, if you do,

129
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:44.559
what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna skin you alive.


130
00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:47.796
Now, get out there
and get me whiskey.


131
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.364
Top-shelf whiskey.

132
00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:51.432
Get!

133
00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:03.277
One game. Just one game.

134
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:06.848
Will it kill you
to let me win one game?


135
00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:45.319
This is a private party.

136
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.782
Like I said before...

137
00:17:15.751 --> 00:17:18.654
this here is a private party.

138
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.158
Are those roasted peanuts?

139
00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:26.695
May I have one?

140
00:17:47.115 --> 00:17:49.283
They <i>are</i> roasted peanuts.

141
00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:51.720
Holy shit.

142
00:17:58.592 --> 00:18:00.796
A little something.

143
00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:07.836
What the...

144
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.674
You done ruined my peanuts.

145
00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:14.943
Mm-mmm.

146
00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:17.511
Nothing short of a miracle.

147
00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:22.450
Now...

148
00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.689
try one.

149
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:39.500
Now, those are
some good roasted peanuts.


150
00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:52.848
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

151
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:54.883
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.


152
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.286
You know,
may I have some whiskey?


153
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.690
These, uh...

154
00:19:01.823 --> 00:19:05.559
These peanuts build up
a paste in your mouth.


155
00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:17.005
Ah.

156
00:19:17.139 --> 00:19:19.306
Now, that's some good shit
right there.


157
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.076
Good shit.

158
00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:25.247
Say, uh, what are you playing
over there?


159
00:19:25.379 --> 00:19:26.347
Solitaire.

160
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.618
I heard about that.

161
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.721
But, uh, never had
the chance to play it.


162
00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:36.124
- You any good at it?
- <i>Sí, bueno.</i> He...


163
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:37.458
No. Nothing.

164
00:19:41.163 --> 00:19:43.932
Ooh, ooh. Too much tequila.
I gotta go pee-pee.


165
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:48.435
Seems like quite
a difficult game.


166
00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:50.404
How does one play?

167
00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:53.074
Carefully.

168
00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:55.376
Hmm.

169
00:19:57.879 --> 00:19:59.781
Peanuts are fine.

170
00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:02.784
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?


171
00:20:02.918 --> 00:20:07.321
Why are two gentlemen like you

172
00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:09.257
in my establishment?

173
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.827
Well, I couldn't agree more.

174
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:20.467
Looking for this guy.

175
00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:30.912
I ain't never seen him.

176
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.884
Help me out!

177
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.414
- Four. That was four.
- That was five.


178
00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:09.483
- That was four.
- That was five.


179
00:21:09.618 --> 00:21:12.654
That... One, two, three, four.

180
00:21:12.787 --> 00:21:16.523
One, two, three, four, and five.

181
00:21:18.827 --> 00:21:21.462
Son of a bitch. God...

182
00:21:25.432 --> 00:21:26.868
Five.

183
00:21:28.103 --> 00:21:29.738
- That was six.
- That was five.


184
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:30.705
Six.

185
00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:32.741
Goddamn it. That was five.

186
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:35.877
One, two, three, four, five.

187
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:37.979
Shh.

188
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.296
Now, that was six.

189
00:21:54.428 --> 00:21:56.430
That was good.

190
00:21:57.866 --> 00:21:59.566
That was really good.

191
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:01.303
Now, go get him.

192
00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:03.038
All right.

193
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.719
All right, let's go, Mexican.

194
00:22:17.852 --> 00:22:20.922
Huh? <i>Gracias.</i>

195
00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:53.855
The horses are back there, sir.

196
00:22:53.989 --> 00:22:55.890
All right, Lieutenant.
What you got?


197
00:22:56.024 --> 00:22:59.861
There's a cabin
about a half mile up that trail.


198
00:22:59.995 --> 00:23:02.797
Sir, I suggest we reconnoiter
the position.


199
00:23:04.165 --> 00:23:05.566
Very well. Carry on.

200
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.402
We'll send someone
down to the cabin,


201
00:23:07.568 --> 00:23:08.670
and then we'll set up.

202
00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:10.038
That sounds good and all,

203
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:12.140
but if'n he ain't here,
we should just quit.


204
00:23:12.273 --> 00:23:15.076
I'm tired of chasing
this son of a bitch.


205
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.817
We're all tired, Lieutenant.

206
00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:24.518
- Private.
- Yes, sir.


207
00:23:24.652 --> 00:23:27.655
Get your ass on up
to that farmhouse.


208
00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:43.405
Billy Goat Gang.

209
00:23:43.537 --> 00:23:45.673
It said "alive."

210
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:50.712
I know. I know.
Like I said before...


211
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.214
they like revenge.

212
00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:56.918
I did them a favor,
them old dirty bastards.


213
00:23:57.052 --> 00:24:00.221
We are not getting paid
on this job.


214
00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:02.023
Oh, stop your hollerin' already.

215
00:24:02.157 --> 00:24:05.493
Don't get all mad and your
unmentionables up in a wad.


216
00:24:05.627 --> 00:24:07.529
I'll straighten it out.

217
00:24:07.662 --> 00:24:09.764
Yeah, well,
you'd better see to it.


218
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.135
And since we're gonna be
near a mercantile,


219
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:16.504
we're gonna have to pick up
some supplies.


220
00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:19.573
The horses are gonna need
to be shod.


221
00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:24.345
By the way,
what are unmentionables?


222
00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:34.456
Don't forget to pick up
some dynamite...


223
00:24:34.588 --> 00:24:35.957
for Dynamite.

224
00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:37.892
Yeah.

225
00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:42.330
So, those old boys fell
for your candlestick trick, hmm?


226
00:24:42.464 --> 00:24:43.965
Yep.

227
00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:48.203
They were a little drunk
and feeble, so that helped.


228
00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:52.474
You know, I don't think they
could see all that well either.


229
00:24:52.606 --> 00:24:54.776
Hmm. Yeah.

230
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:58.646
They don't listen either.

231
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.348
So the church.

232
00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:04.252
How many sticks did you use?

233
00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:11.860
Ah, fuck.

234
00:25:14.496 --> 00:25:16.397
You gotta be kidding me.

235
00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:20.902
23 sticks in all.

236
00:25:21.035 --> 00:25:23.738
Ah, you wasteful shitbird.

237
00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:25.940
I know.

238
00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:28.276
You know, you could've done
twice as much damage


239
00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:30.445
with half as many.

240
00:25:31.212 --> 00:25:34.182
Probably. But you know
I like to do my job


241
00:25:34.315 --> 00:25:36.017
as thorough as possible.

242
00:25:40.588 --> 00:25:42.123
Ay.

243
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:47.395
Ah.

244
00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:49.632
Don't mind if I do.

245
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:07.215
Whew! Oh, my God. Oh, my Lord.
They're chasing me.


246
00:26:07.348 --> 00:26:10.218
They wanna kill me.
Help me, please.


247
00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:12.153
- Who's chasing you?
- Them.


248
00:26:12.287 --> 00:26:14.822
Yes. Them.
But who the hell's them?


249
00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:18.226
Where are you going?

250
00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:20.562
Stop your
stammerin' around, mister.


251
00:26:20.695 --> 00:26:22.330
What's your name?

252
00:26:22.463 --> 00:26:24.098
Help, please.

253
00:26:25.266 --> 00:26:26.501
Name!

254
00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:30.038
I don't know!
I don't want them to find me.


255
00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:32.273
My name's John.

256
00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:34.342
John.

257
00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:41.716
Wait.

258
00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:43.652
Are you with them?

259
00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:46.721
Are you vigilantes? Hired men?

260
00:26:46.854 --> 00:26:47.855
- No.
- No.


261
00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:51.125
Oh! Good. Thank you.

262
00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:53.662
Well, you could
help me possibly.


263
00:26:53.795 --> 00:26:56.197
They're coming for me.
A lot of them.


264
00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:03.204
Oh.

265
00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:05.773
I don't see anyone
at the present moment.


266
00:27:05.907 --> 00:27:07.842
Nobody?

267
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.147
Mister, I suggest you tell us
what's going on.


268
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:16.751
Please!
They wanna take my life!


269
00:27:16.884 --> 00:27:19.120
I haven't done anything.

270
00:27:19.254 --> 00:27:23.258
I beg you.
I beg you for mercy. Please.


271
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:25.026
Mercy?

272
00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:27.195
- I don't know.
- I don't like this guy.


273
00:27:27.328 --> 00:27:29.998
Quit your whining.

274
00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:37.405
You can hurt me,
but you will not take my life.


275
00:27:37.538 --> 00:27:39.774
Oh, shut up!

276
00:27:39.907 --> 00:27:42.143
Or we will kill you.

277
00:27:42.277 --> 00:27:45.480
Not one word unless spoken to.
You understand?


278
00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:50.318
Oh, Jesus.

279
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:54.155
I'm terribly thirsty.
You have anything to drink?


280
00:27:58.493 --> 00:27:59.961
Thank you.

281
00:28:00.094 --> 00:28:02.030
Oh, thank you.

282
00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:23.786
Oh!

283
00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.955
Ah, fine. I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.


284
00:28:28.089 --> 00:28:30.224
Naa!

285
00:28:30.358 --> 00:28:32.160
- Didn't I tell him?
- You told him.


286
00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:33.729
- I told him, right?
- You told him.


287
00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:35.263
- You heard me.
- I heard you.


288
00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:38.166
He heard me. How many times
do I gotta tell you?


289
00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:41.637
Not to speak unless spoken to.

290
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.605
The bullshit act
stops here, John.


291
00:28:50.978 --> 00:28:54.215
Until spoken to.

292
00:29:11.132 --> 00:29:12.867
Very well.

293
00:29:14.737 --> 00:29:16.805
I was acting in a play.

294
00:29:16.938 --> 00:29:19.474
I'm an actor, you see.

295
00:29:19.607 --> 00:29:22.745
And a damn good one,
I might add.


296
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:27.683
Some say maybe the best
in the world, I tell you.


297
00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:29.250
In my last performance,

298
00:29:29.384 --> 00:29:32.855
I went to procure payment
for my services,


299
00:29:32.987 --> 00:29:35.556
where I was pounced upon
by the stagehands


300
00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:37.959
and believe I suffered
a broken leg


301
00:29:38.092 --> 00:29:40.461
due to this misfortune.

302
00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:43.164
The producers
thought I was someone else.


303
00:29:43.297 --> 00:29:45.566
A charlatan of some sort.

304
00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:52.674
Now, if you fine gentlemen
could help me back to my hotel


305
00:29:52.808 --> 00:29:56.177
in secrecy and protect me,

306
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.213
I would pay you handsomely
for your services.


307
00:29:59.347 --> 00:30:03.117
I have $12,000 waiting
in a safe deposit box


308
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:05.319
at the Grove Hotel.

309
00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:12.694
Hey, No Name.
Get your ass over here.


310
00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:20.334
Captain, sir, the cabin seems
to be unoccupied at this time.


311
00:30:20.468 --> 00:30:23.004
I bet that slick bastard's
long gone.


312
00:30:23.137 --> 00:30:25.440
Let's get the hell out of here.

313
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:35.216
John Wilkes Booth.

314
00:30:36.484 --> 00:30:39.587
This is Captain Forbes,
United States Army.


315
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:41.623
You got five minutes.

316
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:44.158
Five minutes, Mr. Booth,
on my command.


317
00:30:44.292 --> 00:30:45.993
- You seeing this?
- Yeah.


318
00:30:46.127 --> 00:30:47.663
These men will burn
that structure down


319
00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:49.096
and the ground around you.

320
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.466
Give me
a quarter stick of dynamite.


321
00:30:54.469 --> 00:30:58.172
All right. Now, listen up.

322
00:30:58.306 --> 00:30:59.942
You're gonna take asshole
on a horse


323
00:31:00.074 --> 00:31:01.576
and get him ready
to go out the back.


324
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.812
I'm gonna lay down a field
of fire here on the front.


325
00:31:03.946 --> 00:31:05.446
Hell of a plan.

326
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.883
Let's go before they know
what hit 'em.


327
00:31:08.015 --> 00:31:09.718
Come on, asshole.

328
00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:14.589
Remember, $12,000
if you keep me safe.


329
00:31:30.873 --> 00:31:32.240
Fire!

330
00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:40.381
Forward, boys!
Let's double quick!


331
00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:42.116
Yes, sir!

332
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:49.023
That son of a bitch,
he got away,


333
00:31:49.156 --> 00:31:50.792
and he had the help
of two more men!


334
00:31:50.926 --> 00:31:53.394
They skedaddled, Captain!

335
00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:57.064
Son of a bitch.

336
00:33:34.997 --> 00:33:37.231
Damn good beans.

337
00:33:39.901 --> 00:33:41.803
Do you know...

338
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:44.138
in ancient Egypt...

339
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:46.642
they would burn
the dead with beans


340
00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:50.144
to ensure their return
to the afterlife?


341
00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:55.984
The beanfield was a place
where the souls of the dead


342
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.788
would await their reincarnation.

343
00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:01.757
True story.

344
00:34:03.257 --> 00:34:05.127
Is that why you like beans?

345
00:34:12.768 --> 00:34:17.739
So, the two men that saved you,

346
00:34:17.873 --> 00:34:19.741
who are they?

347
00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:26.648
I'm not quite sure.

348
00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:36.557
They did not...
They did not come for me.


349
00:34:36.692 --> 00:34:39.628
They came for Mr. Black Jack.

350
00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:46.267
There's my love.
What have you been...


351
00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:49.104
Sergio.

352
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.507
Hilda, not now. No. Go. Not now.

353
00:34:54.408 --> 00:34:56.678
Hilda, run! Get out of here!

354
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.685
Please.

355
00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:05.286
Señor.

356
00:35:05.419 --> 00:35:07.288
Please.

357
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.732
Hilda?

358
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.399
Chair.

359
00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:22.536
Señor Brown.

360
00:35:25.841 --> 00:35:28.677
Señor, please.

361
00:35:36.184 --> 00:35:38.854
No!

362
00:35:42.958 --> 00:35:46.427
Okay. Don't hurt her.
I'll tell you anything.


363
00:35:48.997 --> 00:35:50.866
What they look like?

364
00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:54.268
One gringo. One chino.

365
00:36:44.518 --> 00:36:46.788
You are coming with me.

366
00:36:46.922 --> 00:36:49.057
No. No!

367
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:50.192
No!

368
00:36:55.429 --> 00:36:57.498
No!

369
00:36:57.632 --> 00:37:00.936
No, <i>mi amore!</i>

370
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:03.537
No, no!

371
00:37:06.208 --> 00:37:07.541
No!

372
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.779
Okay, now, where are they?

373
00:38:24.152 --> 00:38:26.621
That smells.

374
00:38:30.457 --> 00:38:32.961
What the hell is this?

375
00:38:33.094 --> 00:38:34.763
Oh!

376
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:39.200
Um, let me think here. Um...

377
00:38:39.334 --> 00:38:41.568
These guys are them guys.

378
00:38:41.703 --> 00:38:44.072
Sorry, mister.

379
00:38:44.205 --> 00:38:45.506
No can do.

380
00:38:46.942 --> 00:38:52.013
We need an identifiable corpse
for all rewards.


381
00:38:52.147 --> 00:38:54.149
Identifiable.

382
00:38:55.984 --> 00:38:58.987
This looks pretty
goddamn identifiable to me.


383
00:39:00.956 --> 00:39:03.158
The proof is in the bag,
you old geezer.


384
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:07.796
I'm sorry, sonny,
but I have rules to abide by,


385
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:13.201
and no body means no reward.

386
00:39:13.335 --> 00:39:15.003
No reward?

387
00:39:16.805 --> 00:39:18.673
I told you, mister,

388
00:39:18.807 --> 00:39:21.676
the identifiable parts
is right here.


389
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.179
These guys are them guys!

390
00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:27.514
You get outta here right now,
yellow boy...


391
00:39:27.649 --> 00:39:29.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, old bastard.


392
00:39:29.884 --> 00:39:32.754
...before I fill your ass
full of lead.


393
00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:34.856
I'm finding the door.
I'm walking.


394
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.490
- Get out!
- I'm walking.


395
00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:37.859
Go on. Get out.

396
00:39:37.993 --> 00:39:39.394
You goofy round-eye,
old wrinkled bastard.


397
00:39:39.526 --> 00:39:40.996
Get out now!

398
00:42:39.642 --> 00:42:42.645
You mother...

399
00:42:46.681 --> 00:42:48.783
You get the reward?

400
00:42:58.293 --> 00:43:00.595
No payout.

401
00:43:00.728 --> 00:43:03.965
No. No payout.

402
00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:07.235
And for that shitbird,
Black Jack?


403
00:43:07.368 --> 00:43:09.170
Nothing.

404
00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:11.339
Not even a dime for that turd

405
00:43:11.472 --> 00:43:14.075
or the remnants
of the Billy Goat Gang.


406
00:43:14.209 --> 00:43:17.278
Barkeep, I need a drink.
I need it bad.


407
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:23.084
Can you act?

408
00:43:24.586 --> 00:43:25.720
No.

409
00:43:27.055 --> 00:43:28.990
Do you know what acting is?

410
00:43:29.123 --> 00:43:31.059
I've been to a play once.

411
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.629
Mister, you're okay?

412
00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:36.699
No, I am not okay.
I'm in dire need for an actor


413
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:39.200
to play the lead
in my play tonight.


414
00:43:39.334 --> 00:43:41.002
Hey, mister.

415
00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:43.371
You need an actor?

416
00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:45.206
Yes. But it can't be you.

417
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.909
You're too... You're, uh, too...

418
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:51.212
You're, um... I'm sorry.
You're not the right type.


419
00:44:00.288 --> 00:44:01.724
Hello.

420
00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:04.459
I'm not an actor,
but I know one.


421
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.464
Hey, John.

422
00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:12.300
Good afternoon.

423
00:44:12.433 --> 00:44:14.902
This man here
is looking for an actor.


424
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.171
I'm not an actor.

425
00:44:17.305 --> 00:44:20.408
What do you mean
you're not an actor?


426
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:22.143
You're one of the best
damn actors there is.


427
00:44:22.277 --> 00:44:24.647
You even said so yourself.

428
00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:28.983
He also did this play
called "The American Assassin."


429
00:44:29.117 --> 00:44:31.386
"An American Assassin"?

430
00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:36.591
You can act.

431
00:44:36.725 --> 00:44:38.459
You have saved me, my good man,

432
00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:40.995
and I need you to act
in my play tonight.


433
00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:42.363
Here's the script.

434
00:44:42.497 --> 00:44:44.165
We must get you
to the theater immediately.


435
00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:45.900
I can't believe
this is happening!


436
00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:48.136
Barkeep, a bottle on me
for those two.


437
00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:50.138
And I would love you
to be my guests tonight.


438
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:53.107
Two reserved seats
on the house.


439
00:44:53.241 --> 00:44:54.309
You.

440
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:56.077
- Thank you, mister.
- You're gonna be great.


441
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.646
And good luck tonight!

442
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.247
What do you
expect from me?


443
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.549
You look perfect
for this part.


444
00:45:12.327 --> 00:45:15.463
I would like bottle
and some glasses.


445
00:45:15.596 --> 00:45:16.531
Four glasses.

446
00:45:16.665 --> 00:45:18.433
Anything for you, Taviano.

447
00:45:18.566 --> 00:45:20.168
You gonna do a show
for us tonight?


448
00:45:20.301 --> 00:45:22.870
No. No show.
I'm just passing through.


449
00:45:23.004 --> 00:45:24.305
No show tonight.

450
00:45:24.439 --> 00:45:25.540
Okay.

451
00:45:25.674 --> 00:45:28.409
Excuse me. Are you an actor?

452
00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:31.446
No. I'm magician.

453
00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:33.247
Magician?

454
00:45:34.582 --> 00:45:37.919
Hear that, No Name?
He's a magician.


455
00:45:39.587 --> 00:45:41.956
I got an idea.

456
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.392
Mr. Magician.

457
00:45:47.095 --> 00:45:49.597
Can you make
this peanut disappear?


458
00:46:04.078 --> 00:46:06.782
Goddamn! You see that, No Name?

459
00:46:06.914 --> 00:46:08.483
He made the peanut disappear.

460
00:46:08.616 --> 00:46:10.084
It was in his left hand,
moved it around,


461
00:46:10.218 --> 00:46:11.986
and then he went back
to his left hand,


462
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.955
and it came out his mouth.

463
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.363
Okay, ladies, let's go.

464
00:46:22.497 --> 00:46:25.032
Come see our show!
One night only!


465
00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:26.869
Get 'em going.

466
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:29.270
Two bits. Come on in. Two bits.

467
00:46:29.404 --> 00:46:31.572
Come on in for a good time.

468
00:46:31.707 --> 00:46:34.676
Special on Tarheels.

469
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.411
Yeah!

470
00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:39.748
Come on in, boys,
and get your vodka!


471
00:47:22.658 --> 00:47:23.892
Thank you.

472
00:47:24.025 --> 00:47:25.861
I would like
to present to you tonight


473
00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:28.463
a tale of treachery and deceit.

474
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:32.099
Of course we have
to add a splash of levity


475
00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:33.702
along the way as well.

476
00:47:33.836 --> 00:47:37.205
I now ask you to sit back

477
00:47:37.338 --> 00:47:41.108
and enjoy
"A Light Through the Darkness."


478
00:47:41.242 --> 00:47:42.310
Whoo!

479
00:47:47.783 --> 00:47:49.918
Think I'm gonna go get us
some whiskey.


480
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:53.755
See if they have those peanuts.
Them roasted ones.


481
00:47:53.889 --> 00:47:57.391
Hey, keep it down over there.
Show some respect.


482
00:47:57.525 --> 00:47:59.393
Shut up.

483
00:48:03.064 --> 00:48:05.667
Whoo!

484
00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:12.273
I told you time and again,
Emma Sue,


485
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:17.411
I wouldn't waste my time
on such rubbish as Charles.


486
00:48:17.545 --> 00:48:19.614
Oh!

487
00:48:21.015 --> 00:48:24.853
That's what you get for lying,
you heated Jezebel!


488
00:48:24.987 --> 00:48:27.355
Oh!

489
00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:32.293
Oh, the whore!

490
00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:36.531
How could my most
cherished friend hurt me so?


491
00:48:36.665 --> 00:48:38.800
I should've known
this would happen.


492
00:48:38.934 --> 00:48:41.803
Even when we were children,
she was the jealous type.


493
00:48:41.937 --> 00:48:46.675
I can't help that such a dashing
young man is in love with me.


494
00:48:52.814 --> 00:48:54.515
Oh, no!

495
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.151
You wicked double-minded wench.

496
00:48:57.285 --> 00:49:00.187
You're nothing
but a low-life...


497
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:02.456
Oh! Oh!

498
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.660
Get her! Get her!

499
00:49:04.793 --> 00:49:07.629
- Get her!
- Get her. That's it.


500
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:15.570
There you go.

501
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:47.669
Now what are you gonna do?

502
00:49:47.803 --> 00:49:49.203
Who is it?

503
00:49:49.337 --> 00:49:51.073
It is I, my love.

504
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.941
Please don't keep
a fella waiting,


505
00:49:53.075 --> 00:49:55.443
for I've long to see you,
my sweet.


506
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:02.149
Is everything okay, dearest?

507
00:50:02.283 --> 00:50:04.552
Think, Emma Sue. Think.

508
00:50:24.538 --> 00:50:26.207
Come in.

509
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:31.379
Emma Sue!

510
00:50:31.512 --> 00:50:34.650
You are most irresistible,
darling.


511
00:50:34.783 --> 00:50:37.853
I cannot tell you
how long I've waited for you.


512
00:50:37.986 --> 00:50:39.955
Mwah.

513
00:50:40.088 --> 00:50:45.060
Charles, my love, I want this.
I need this.


514
00:50:45.192 --> 00:50:47.395
But can I spare your patience

515
00:50:47.528 --> 00:50:50.966
to play along with me
in a game of intimacy?


516
00:50:56.337 --> 00:50:58.439
What? What, my sweet?

517
00:50:58.572 --> 00:51:00.608
No need to tarry.
I've got what you need.


518
00:51:02.443 --> 00:51:04.780
Oh!

519
00:51:04.913 --> 00:51:06.782
Now, put this on,

520
00:51:06.915 --> 00:51:10.184
and I'll take you outside for
the ride of your life, darling.


521
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:15.222
Then tally-ho, shall we?

522
00:51:15.356 --> 00:51:17.224
This is so entertaining,
dearest.


523
00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:20.561
What in tarnation was that?

524
00:51:20.696 --> 00:51:23.031
Oh. What, darling?
I didn't hear anything.


525
00:51:23.165 --> 00:51:25.299
That.

526
00:51:25.433 --> 00:51:28.670
Don't tell me
you didn't hear that.


527
00:51:28.804 --> 00:51:30.872
What the hell is that?
Who is it?


528
00:51:31.006 --> 00:51:33.075
Oh.

529
00:51:33.207 --> 00:51:34.943
Darling, I can explain.

530
00:51:35.077 --> 00:51:37.611
I can explain it to you outside
with a breath of fresh air.


531
00:51:37.746 --> 00:51:39.047
Come on.

532
00:51:39.181 --> 00:51:40.882
Oh!

533
00:51:43.018 --> 00:51:44.920
Mirabel?

534
00:51:45.053 --> 00:51:47.122
What the devil is going on here?

535
00:51:47.254 --> 00:51:48.924
I think I should take my leave.

536
00:51:51.093 --> 00:51:52.861
Oh, Charles, my love.

537
00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:55.697
I don't know
how she could've gotten here.


538
00:51:55.831 --> 00:51:57.565
I haven't
the slightest idea why.


539
00:51:57.699 --> 00:52:00.836
Why did you try and kill me,
Emma Sue?


540
00:52:00.969 --> 00:52:03.504
I never did anything
to hurt you.


541
00:52:03.638 --> 00:52:07.008
I thought we were friends,
Emma Sue.


542
00:52:07.142 --> 00:52:10.578
Aw!

543
00:52:10.712 --> 00:52:13.447
I must be taking
my leave now.


544
00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:15.817
How can one person
be so callous?


545
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:18.854
Charles!

546
00:52:18.987 --> 00:52:21.957
You can't leave me.

547
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:23.091
Never.

548
00:52:23.225 --> 00:52:24.893
- Emma Sue.
- Charles.


549
00:52:26.094 --> 00:52:27.095
- Look at me.
- Whoa.


550
00:52:28.964 --> 00:52:30.665
Oh!

551
00:53:00.294 --> 00:53:01.328
Yeah.

552
00:53:01.462 --> 00:53:03.397
Thank you all for coming!

553
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:05.700
That was pretty nice.

554
00:53:05.834 --> 00:53:07.903
- Them girls were good, man.
- Yeah, they were.


555
00:53:08.036 --> 00:53:09.738
I sure enjoyed that.

556
00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:12.240
That's probably the best
two bits I've ever spent.


557
00:53:12.373 --> 00:53:16.343
Two bits? You think two bits
can get us one of them girls?


558
00:53:16.477 --> 00:53:18.612
Maybe $2.

559
00:53:18.747 --> 00:53:21.950
Oh, my God!
It's the guy from the play!


560
00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:23.718
I
-I just saw him.

561
00:53:23.852 --> 00:53:26.922
He-He rode off on a horse.
He went that way.


562
00:53:27.055 --> 00:53:29.523
Oh, my God!
He killed the president!


563
00:53:29.658 --> 00:53:31.492
The president's dead?

564
00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:34.029
Oh, my God!
The president's dead!


565
00:53:35.897 --> 00:53:37.498
Huh.

566
00:53:37.632 --> 00:53:40.235
War Department in Washington.

567
00:53:40.367 --> 00:53:41.870
What the hell.

568
00:53:42.003 --> 00:53:46.107
"Murderer of our late beloved
president, Abraham Lincoln.


569
00:53:46.241 --> 00:53:48.609
John Wilkes Booth."

570
00:53:48.743 --> 00:53:50.477
Look at that. Shit.

571
00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:53.048
Shit.

572
00:53:53.181 --> 00:53:54.381
Shit!

573
00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:55.917
Shit!

574
00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:01.990
Let's go get him.

575
00:54:02.123 --> 00:54:03.992
Goddamn it.

576
00:55:00.248 --> 00:55:04.185
I just never would've figured
him for a murderer, No Name.


577
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:06.121
He's such a good actor.

578
00:55:06.254 --> 00:55:09.090
But the president, no less?

579
00:55:09.224 --> 00:55:11.960
That's pretty cool,
come to think of it.


580
00:55:13.328 --> 00:55:15.630
Well, good actor or not,

581
00:55:15.764 --> 00:55:18.733
he's worth $50,000, partner.

582
00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:25.240
And this time, let's try alive,
not dead.


583
00:55:25.373 --> 00:55:29.110
I suppose you're right.

584
00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:30.345
Just never know

585
00:55:30.477 --> 00:55:33.715
when evil lurks
in the hearts of men sometimes.


586
00:55:33.848 --> 00:55:36.918
A real bona fide assassin.

587
00:55:37.052 --> 00:55:39.688
Don't get riled up
over his fame.


588
00:55:39.821 --> 00:55:42.157
He's just
a bloodthirsty assassin.


589
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.525
Nothing more, nothing less.

590
00:55:47.362 --> 00:55:48.897
You're right.

591
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.867
I guess I just got all caught up
in all the fun of it all.


592
00:55:54.836 --> 00:55:58.173
Come to think of it,
you did, too.


593
00:55:58.306 --> 00:56:01.276
What was her name anyways?
I never got to meet her.


594
00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:04.346
Dynamite, let's try to focus up,
all right? Just let it go.


595
00:56:04.478 --> 00:56:05.347
Focus up here.

596
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.990
Just be quiet. Shut up.

597
00:56:23.198 --> 00:56:25.834
It was pretty funny.
Those two gals got after it


598
00:56:25.967 --> 00:56:28.670
like a couple of polecats.

599
00:56:28.803 --> 00:56:30.238
Oh, shit.

600
00:56:30.372 --> 00:56:32.374
And then when John died.

601
00:56:32.506 --> 00:56:34.442
When he got shot and stuff.

602
00:56:34.575 --> 00:56:36.478
He got shot.
He was like... aaaah!


603
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.047
That was pretty
fucking hilarious.


604
00:56:41.216 --> 00:56:44.352
I told you, man,
that was... that was some shit.


605
00:56:44.486 --> 00:56:47.588
That was some shit.

606
00:56:48.656 --> 00:56:50.291
Evenin', gentlemen.

607
00:56:57.832 --> 00:56:59.634
Now, take those guns out.

608
00:56:59.768 --> 00:57:01.870
Slowly.

609
00:57:02.003 --> 00:57:05.173
And drop them on the ground
near me.


610
00:57:08.043 --> 00:57:09.610
Like this?

611
00:57:11.746 --> 00:57:16.117
Now, Black Jack Bennet
was my partner.


612
00:57:16.251 --> 00:57:18.686
Upon his demise,

613
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.688
it's all mine.

614
00:57:20.822 --> 00:57:22.424
Now, where's the gold?

615
00:57:22.556 --> 00:57:24.826
Gold.

616
00:57:24.959 --> 00:57:28.763
Don't play me for a fool.
Where's the gold?


617
00:57:28.897 --> 00:57:31.699
We ain't after the gold,
just the bounty.


618
00:57:31.833 --> 00:57:34.202
After a wanted man,
in case you didn't know.


619
00:57:34.335 --> 00:57:37.505
Don't lie to me, boy.

620
00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:42.377
Listen. We're bounty hunters,
and that's what we do.


621
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:45.013
I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
call my friend here a liar.


622
00:57:45.146 --> 00:57:46.848
You'll appreciate it, do you?

623
00:57:49.417 --> 00:57:53.621
Well, you boys got a line
of shit, I will give you that.


624
00:57:53.755 --> 00:57:55.657
More importantly,

625
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.827
you have a nice payout
down in the cabin,


626
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.964
and I think
that might be mighty profitable


627
00:58:03.098 --> 00:58:05.233
now that you've come
to mention it.


628
00:58:05.366 --> 00:58:07.068
Yeah, maybe so.

629
00:58:07.202 --> 00:58:09.938
Yeah, that is so.

630
00:58:10.071 --> 00:58:12.240
Bigger than your penny-ass,
nickle dime shit


631
00:58:12.373 --> 00:58:13.808
you would've got
from Black Jack, mister.


632
00:58:13.942 --> 00:58:15.076
Dynamite, knock it off.

633
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.744
You damn right
there's a hostage,


634
00:58:16.878 --> 00:58:18.213
and a big amount of payout

635
00:58:18.346 --> 00:58:20.248
is due upon the delivery
of that bounty.


636
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:23.084
Hey, Dynamite, knock it off.
Pipe down.


637
00:58:23.218 --> 00:58:24.919
All right.

638
00:58:27.388 --> 00:58:28.790
He's right.

639
00:58:28.923 --> 00:58:31.960
Big payout.

640
00:58:32.093 --> 00:58:33.661
Okay.

641
00:58:33.795 --> 00:58:36.664
You. Pick up your gun.

642
00:58:40.068 --> 00:58:41.336
Easy.

643
00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:49.410
Now, go down to the cabin.

644
00:58:50.912 --> 00:58:53.615
Bring back that hostage.

645
00:58:53.748 --> 00:58:55.550
One false move,

646
00:58:55.683 --> 00:58:58.887
and your partner here is dead.

647
00:58:59.988 --> 00:59:03.358
Now, get going. 
Now, hurry up.

648
00:59:03.491 --> 00:59:05.426
No Name?

649
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.762
Yeah. Just make it quick.

650
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.972
Let me go.

651
00:59:18.106 --> 00:59:21.876
Can't you see I'm bleeding
to dea... Oh, no, no, no, no!


652
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.145
I told you to stop whining.

653
00:59:24.279 --> 00:59:27.482
Oh! Oh!

654
00:59:28.249 --> 00:59:31.519
It's nice to finally get
some peace and quiet here.


655
00:59:31.654 --> 00:59:35.757
Oh. That there is my knife,

656
00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:37.692
and I'll be taking it back, Ed.

657
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.197
Oh! I bet that felt good.

658
00:59:43.298 --> 00:59:44.599
Come again?

659
00:59:44.732 --> 00:59:47.202
I didn't quite hear you.

660
00:59:48.236 --> 00:59:52.240
Oh. You want some more wine.

661
00:59:54.075 --> 00:59:57.779
Well, here you go.

662
00:59:57.912 --> 01:00:00.315
You sure deserved it.

663
01:00:00.448 --> 01:00:01.684
Besides,

664
01:00:01.816 --> 01:00:04.252
you look kinda pale and all.

665
01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:07.855
That wine there is gonna
make you feel alive again.


666
01:00:07.989 --> 01:00:10.425
Mm.

667
01:00:10.558 --> 01:00:13.494
Can you believe...

668
01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:15.530
that kid...

669
01:00:15.664 --> 01:00:20.301
killed the president
of the United States?


670
01:00:29.645 --> 01:00:31.112
Ouch.

671
01:00:32.648 --> 01:00:34.415
Oh, this hurts.

672
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.885
This hurts.

673
01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:41.923
Uh-oh.

674
01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.792
I think I have a broken nose.

675
01:00:46.494 --> 01:00:49.130
You better let me go.

676
01:00:49.264 --> 01:00:51.700
They're coming to rescue me.

677
01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:53.401
Who?

678
01:00:53.534 --> 01:00:56.739
Ain't no one's
gonna find you here.


679
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:59.642
Like no one found
these guys I killed


680
01:00:59.774 --> 01:01:01.909
over two years ago.

681
01:01:02.043 --> 01:01:03.978
Goddamn it.

682
01:01:07.115 --> 01:01:09.917
So, with that being said,

683
01:01:10.051 --> 01:01:13.187
I don't think
I can do that, mister.


684
01:01:13.321 --> 01:01:16.557
At least till I collect
that reward for you...


685
01:01:16.692 --> 01:01:17.792
for killing the president.

686
01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.961
Please.

687
01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:22.463
That president had it coming.

688
01:01:24.232 --> 01:01:26.501
You need to listen to me.

689
01:01:26.635 --> 01:01:29.103
I'm not the man they say I am.

690
01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:34.042
I did justice,
and you all should be grateful.


691
01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:37.312
My face!

692
01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:38.846
All right!

693
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.848
That tears it.

694
01:01:40.982 --> 01:01:43.652
There's something
stuck in my face.


695
01:01:44.419 --> 01:01:47.288
I've had enough of this shit.

696
01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:53.294
Huh.

697
01:01:54.663 --> 01:01:55.830
There.

698
01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.299
That's more like it.

699
01:01:59.434 --> 01:02:00.669
Bop.

700
01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:04.773
Go on. You can cry now,
you needy little bitch.


701
01:02:04.906 --> 01:02:06.174
- Woof!
- Oh!


702
01:02:06.307 --> 01:02:09.712
And quit your bleedin'
all over the floor.


703
01:02:09.844 --> 01:02:11.612
Be nice.

704
01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:13.915
There are guests here.

705
01:02:17.585 --> 01:02:19.387
Shh.

706
01:02:29.197 --> 01:02:31.432
You stay right here.

707
01:02:38.106 --> 01:02:40.441
You best hold up right there.

708
01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:45.012
One more move...

709
01:02:45.146 --> 01:02:47.448
and I'm gonna shoot.

710
01:02:51.854 --> 01:02:53.287
Shh.

711
01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:58.761
Oh. John. Holy shit.

712
01:02:58.893 --> 01:03:01.596
You're shot. You okay?

713
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.399
What the hell happened? Huh?

714
01:03:04.532 --> 01:03:05.701
Here.

715
01:03:05.834 --> 01:03:07.468
I'm okay.

716
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:10.338
Hey, we gotta stop
the bleeding.


717
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:13.007
Goddamn it. Put this on.
Put your hand right there.


718
01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:15.042
Now, hold tight. Good.

719
01:03:15.176 --> 01:03:16.812
Put pressure right there.

720
01:03:16.944 --> 01:03:19.080
What the hell happened, John?

721
01:03:22.818 --> 01:03:24.185
What in the hell is this?

722
01:03:24.318 --> 01:03:26.554
What the hell you want?

723
01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:31.025
This here
is my friend John here.


724
01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:32.927
You shot him?

725
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.962
This rotten son of a bitch?

726
01:03:35.096 --> 01:03:36.865
Well, I didn't shoot him.

727
01:03:36.998 --> 01:03:39.033
He was already bleedin' out

728
01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:41.637
when I grabbed him
outside the theater.


729
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:44.038
And I think
he'll be staying right here.


730
01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:49.845
Well, looks like
we're in a little fix, lady.


731
01:03:49.977 --> 01:03:53.014
You see, you got someone I need,

732
01:03:53.147 --> 01:03:55.016
and I ain't
letting him die on me.


733
01:03:55.149 --> 01:03:56.617
What the hell
are you waiting for?


734
01:03:56.752 --> 01:03:59.387
- Shoot the crazy witch.
- Shut the hell up, John.


735
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.289
Not another word.

736
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.560
You better listen, John,

737
01:04:05.694 --> 01:04:08.029
and shut your piehole.

738
01:04:10.164 --> 01:04:14.268
Well, what's it gonna be?

739
01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:17.338
I ain't accustomed to shooting
a woman, but I will.


740
01:04:18.674 --> 01:04:20.241
Well, well, well.

741
01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.480
A chivalrous gentlemen, I see.

742
01:04:27.883 --> 01:04:30.485
Well, I tell you what.

743
01:04:35.624 --> 01:04:39.494
Why don't you get No Name
to shoot this bitch?


744
01:04:39.628 --> 01:04:43.431
How the hell you know
a man called No Name?


745
01:04:46.234 --> 01:04:48.035
That's my partner.

746
01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:50.672
We're what you call...

747
01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:54.509
business associates.

748
01:04:58.613 --> 01:05:02.049
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch,
if that don't beat all.


749
01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:04.519
He saved my hide a time or two.

750
01:05:04.653 --> 01:05:06.722
You know what?

751
01:05:06.855 --> 01:05:08.122
Let me tell you...

752
01:05:08.256 --> 01:05:10.692
Let me tell you the time
he really saved my ass.


753
01:05:10.826 --> 01:05:14.930
No shit. Goddamn,
it's a small world, ain't it?


754
01:05:15.062 --> 01:05:17.064
It's really nice to meet you.

755
01:05:17.198 --> 01:05:19.166
Hey, I'm dying over here.

756
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.168
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


757
01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:28.777
I wonder what's taking
your buddy so long.


758
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:32.213
Well, he'll be back directly.

759
01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:35.383
I wouldn't worry
so much about it.


760
01:05:35.516 --> 01:05:39.587
I hate to think that he
was trying to pull a fast one.


761
01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.526
Hey, Hoodoo!
How's my partner doing?


762
01:05:45.661 --> 01:05:48.462
Your partner
is doing just fine.


763
01:05:48.596 --> 01:05:52.668
Howdy, sweetheart.
It's been a long time.


764
01:06:01.944 --> 01:06:03.477
You good with that Hawkens?

765
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:06.848
Well, I'm just fine,
Mr. Dynamite?


766
01:06:06.982 --> 01:06:08.516
I use this rifle

767
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.386
in one of those newfangled
traveling Wild West shows.


768
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.724
I can hit a gnat
off a dog's ass.


769
01:06:15.857 --> 01:06:17.291
At 300 yards.

770
01:06:19.628 --> 01:06:21.195
Damn.

771
01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:25.767
Hey!

772
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:29.871
Just to be sure,
I can't see my friend from here!


773
01:06:30.005 --> 01:06:32.506
Walk him out in the open
if you would, please!


774
01:06:37.713 --> 01:06:39.246
Come on.

775
01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:45.453
There's your sweetheart.

776
01:06:45.586 --> 01:06:48.724
Now, just get your ass up here.

777
01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:01.870
Now!

778
01:07:22.824 --> 01:07:26.028
Pearl. Well, I never thought
I'd say this,


779
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.429
but it's good seeing you.

780
01:07:28.562 --> 01:07:29.898
Hmm.

781
01:07:30.032 --> 01:07:31.532
Well...

782
01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:35.871
it's good to see you, too,
darlin'.


783
01:07:39.273 --> 01:07:41.109
Got pretty wooly
with your friend there


784
01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:43.045
for a minute or two.

785
01:07:43.177 --> 01:07:46.982
You never told me you're running
with a business partner.


786
01:07:47.115 --> 01:07:50.652
Well, for you,
he's not the kinda guy


787
01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:53.187
that would square off
with a female.


788
01:08:01.063 --> 01:08:02.798
Did you shoot him?

789
01:08:02.931 --> 01:08:04.866
Why in the hell
did you shoot him?


790
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.803
Better yet, why did you take off
with him after the play?


791
01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:13.975
Like I told your friend there,

792
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:15.977
I didn't shoot him.

793
01:08:16.111 --> 01:08:18.847
I kinda just bumped into him
after the play.


794
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.117
Bullshit, Pearl.
Someone had to shoot him.


795
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:23.551
Huh.

796
01:08:23.685 --> 01:08:26.387
In the play,
he was shot with a real gun.


797
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.990
- Mm.
- That was real.


798
01:08:29.124 --> 01:08:32.894
Holy shit. I thought
he was acting on that.


799
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:40.267
Pearl put a ball in the chamber.

800
01:08:44.072 --> 01:08:45.207
You know.

801
01:08:47.676 --> 01:08:50.212
I'm still dying here.

802
01:08:50.344 --> 01:08:52.714
What?

803
01:08:52.848 --> 01:08:57.284
You can't even notice?
You're worthless.


804
01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:03.524
He's talking about you.

805
01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:06.393
I need help, you dumb ass.

806
01:09:06.527 --> 01:09:09.197
Now he's
talking about me.


807
01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:11.565
I swear,

808
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:16.905
I've never met
a more ignorant group of...


809
01:09:19.241 --> 01:09:23.812
A... A...

810
01:09:23.945 --> 01:09:26.280
Oh!

811
01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.549
Damn it.

812
01:09:29.785 --> 01:09:31.620
Y'all got caught up
in conversing,


813
01:09:31.753 --> 01:09:33.822
I completely forgot about him.

814
01:09:35.257 --> 01:09:37.659
He look kinda bad.

815
01:09:37.793 --> 01:09:40.996
Poor bastard took quite
a beating from me earlier.


816
01:09:42.563 --> 01:09:44.666
Well, shit.

817
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.501
He's dead. Another lost...
Another lost one.


818
01:09:47.636 --> 01:09:50.404
Dead and not alive.

819
01:09:50.538 --> 01:09:53.440
Hmm. You know what?
The way I see it,


820
01:09:53.574 --> 01:09:56.178
let's take the bounty,
split it three ways.


821
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:58.146
Does that sound fair to you?

822
01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.580
- Fair.
- Fair enough.


823
01:09:59.714 --> 01:10:00.916
- Yeah.
- All right.


824
01:10:01.049 --> 01:10:02.818
- We should probably ride.
- Let's ride.


825
01:10:02.951 --> 01:10:05.053
Get the horses ready.
You know what?


826
01:10:05.187 --> 01:10:07.823
You should probably wrap him up
in a blanket like you do.


827
01:10:07.956 --> 01:10:09.390
Y'all hear that?

828
01:10:09.523 --> 01:10:11.425
- Señor!
- I do.


829
01:10:13.594 --> 01:10:15.263
Go get the horses ready.

830
01:10:15.396 --> 01:10:17.531
Pearl, let's find out
what's hollerin'.


831
01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:20.802
Wrap him up?

832
01:10:24.272 --> 01:10:27.341
Sergio, what are you
doing tied to a tree?


833
01:10:30.645 --> 01:10:32.180
You know him?

834
01:10:32.314 --> 01:10:36.818
Yeah. He was taken hostage
by Black Jack Bennet Gang.


835
01:10:36.952 --> 01:10:38.419
What were you doing here,
Sergio?


836
01:10:38.552 --> 01:10:39.921
Hold.

837
01:10:42.157 --> 01:10:44.826
- <i>Hola,</i> Señor Dynamite.
- What are you doing here?


838
01:10:48.063 --> 01:10:49.698
Hoodoo.

839
01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.402
He killed my wife.

840
01:10:57.839 --> 01:11:00.675
He take me out here again.

841
01:11:00.809 --> 01:11:02.409
He come back
looking for you guys.


842
01:11:02.543 --> 01:11:04.312
That was Hoodoo Brown?

843
01:11:04.445 --> 01:11:06.982
I heard of him.
That son of a bitch.


844
01:11:07.115 --> 01:11:09.084
You coming with us?

845
01:11:09.217 --> 01:11:10.618
No.

846
01:11:10.752 --> 01:11:14.521
I gotta go and, you know,
put my wife to rest.


847
01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:16.791
Ah, <i>sí.</i>

848
01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:20.394
Well, listen, Sergio.

849
01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:24.132
I'm really sorry for your loss.
I feel terrible about that.


850
01:11:24.266 --> 01:11:25.700
But, uh, I'll tell you what,

851
01:11:25.834 --> 01:11:28.637
we'll stop in and see you
on our next ride through there.


852
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.640
Now, listen. Remember that piece
of paper I gave you?


853
01:11:31.773 --> 01:11:34.242
Are you listening?
Remember that piece of paper?


854
01:11:34.376 --> 01:11:36.645
That's how you're gonna reach me
when you hear something


855
01:11:36.778 --> 01:11:38.647
about the Black Jack Bennet
mine.


856
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.649
You remember something
about the mine?


857
01:11:40.782 --> 01:11:43.251
No Name!
I think he's gotta take a piss.


858
01:11:43.385 --> 01:11:46.121
I'm going to piss!

859
01:11:46.254 --> 01:11:47.889
Aah!

860
01:11:50.759 --> 01:11:53.427
<i>Adios,</i> Señor Dynamite!

861
01:12:17.886 --> 01:12:21.455
Get up. Hold up.
Don't go running in there.


862
01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:22.791
No, come on.

863
01:12:22.924 --> 01:12:24.159
What in the hell
she's doing now?


864
01:12:24.292 --> 01:12:26.795
She knows better.
She knows better than that.


865
01:12:30.865 --> 01:12:33.500
What in the world.

866
01:12:33.635 --> 01:12:35.337
Those kids.

867
01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:41.876
Oh, God. Oh!

868
01:12:51.853 --> 01:12:53.955
Name is Little Bill.
You've done been had.


869
01:12:54.089 --> 01:12:56.490
Now, hand that pistol over
nice and easy.


870
01:12:56.624 --> 01:12:57.993
That's nice.

871
01:12:58.126 --> 01:13:00.228
Stay down there with me
and don't move a muscle,


872
01:13:00.362 --> 01:13:01.930
or you're a dead woman.

873
01:13:27.322 --> 01:13:30.225
What in the Sam Hill
kinda shit is this?


874
01:13:30.358 --> 01:13:31.558
Ay-ya.

875
01:13:32.727 --> 01:13:35.497
That's one of them midgets
right there.


876
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.098
Hey!

877
01:13:37.232 --> 01:13:39.234
This...

878
01:13:39.367 --> 01:13:40.735
I don't know what that is.

879
01:13:40.869 --> 01:13:44.305
That looks like
a goddamn train wreck.


880
01:13:44.439 --> 01:13:47.942
You gonna pay,
you rotten son of a bitch.


881
01:13:48.076 --> 01:13:49.978
You killed my brother,
Little Bill.


882
01:13:50.111 --> 01:13:51.578
I'm Little Mary,

883
01:13:51.713 --> 01:13:54.749
and you done messed
with the wrong midget.


884
01:13:54.883 --> 01:13:57.584
I mean, little person,
you prick.


885
01:13:57.719 --> 01:14:00.055
This here's my partner,
Little Peter,


886
01:14:00.188 --> 01:14:02.157
and he ain't one
to be fucked with either.


887
01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:05.627
Now, throw down your weapons,
asswipes.


888
01:14:06.828 --> 01:14:08.930
You heard the lady,
boys and girls.


889
01:14:09.064 --> 01:14:12.500
Throw down your guns.
We can end all this drama.


890
01:14:12.634 --> 01:14:15.070
Give me the body.
He is rightfully mine.


891
01:14:15.203 --> 01:14:19.674
If I can't have him,
none of you can.


892
01:14:19.808 --> 01:14:21.109
I've been following for years

893
01:14:21.242 --> 01:14:23.178
without him giving me
a second glance.


894
01:14:24.879 --> 01:14:26.981
It was meant to be.

895
01:14:29.317 --> 01:14:31.119
You.

896
01:14:31.252 --> 01:14:32.754
You ruined my plan.

897
01:14:32.887 --> 01:14:34.856
Now you must pay with your life.

898
01:14:34.989 --> 01:14:40.594
Oh, go on and make your play,
you crazy son of a bitch.


899
01:14:40.728 --> 01:14:42.697
Come get some,

900
01:14:42.831 --> 01:14:47.068
you and that sawed-off
little runt.


901
01:15:01.282 --> 01:15:02.951
What are you laughing at,
you idiots?


902
01:15:03.084 --> 01:15:05.353
Greetings, my friends.

903
01:15:07.088 --> 01:15:11.993
I'm sorry to say you
no longer have the advantage.


904
01:15:12.127 --> 01:15:15.530
Hey. You're the magician
who walked in the saloon.


905
01:15:15.663 --> 01:15:17.165
That's him, No Name.

906
01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:18.933
You did good
on that one trick, though.


907
01:15:19.067 --> 01:15:20.735
Stop this nonsense bullshit.

908
01:15:20.869 --> 01:15:22.670
You will speak when spoken to.

909
01:15:22.804 --> 01:15:24.339
One more word,

910
01:15:24.472 --> 01:15:29.410
and I will spill your guts
with two barrels of buckshot.


911
01:15:30.178 --> 01:15:34.349
Now, you're going to give us
the body of John Wilkes Booth


912
01:15:34.482 --> 01:15:36.251
on that horse.

913
01:15:38.753 --> 01:15:40.688
See,

914
01:15:40.822 --> 01:15:43.658
back in town,

915
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:47.061
I saw this lovely lady...

916
01:15:47.195 --> 01:15:50.498
ride out on horse
with John Wilkes Booth's body,


917
01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:53.368
and she disappeared in thin air.

918
01:15:58.439 --> 01:16:01.976
Now, you kneel down,

919
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.879
or your friend will be first.

920
01:16:05.013 --> 01:16:07.415
Come on. Get down.

921
01:16:07.549 --> 01:16:09.350
Mr. Taviano.

922
01:16:09.484 --> 01:16:12.854
If you please afford me
one last smoke.


923
01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:14.389
Fine.

924
01:16:14.522 --> 01:16:17.825
Why do you Americans
always want to be so dramatic?


925
01:16:17.959 --> 01:16:20.061
Just die already.

926
01:16:54.796 --> 01:16:58.099
I got you now,
you Rasputin prick.


927
01:16:59.534 --> 01:17:02.804
It's the last time you run out
on me, you no-paying pig.


928
01:17:02.937 --> 01:17:05.807
I chased you across two states,

929
01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.810
countless carnivals
and saloons,


930
01:17:08.943 --> 01:17:12.614
and four
very unreputable cathouses.


931
01:17:12.747 --> 01:17:14.449
Oh, my dearest.

932
01:17:14.582 --> 01:17:17.518
What a wonderful surprise
to see you, my lovely.


933
01:17:17.653 --> 01:17:19.554
We were so worried.

934
01:17:19.688 --> 01:17:21.690
Save it, peckerhead.

935
01:17:21.823 --> 01:17:25.126
It's time to pay the piper,
you unsavory son of a bitch.


936
01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.229
But, my lovely, 
I never meant...

937
01:17:35.303 --> 01:17:38.539
I'm not playing. Time's up.

938
01:17:43.444 --> 01:17:46.080
Oh. Oh, please.

939
01:17:46.214 --> 01:17:48.816
I'm not falling
for one of your phony tricks.


940
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.086
Hey, hold yourself together
and die like a man, pansy boy.


941
01:17:56.124 --> 01:18:00.161
I only beg for your forgiveness

942
01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:03.498
and hope we will meet again
one day,


943
01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:06.735
my delicate desert flower.

944
01:18:06.868 --> 01:18:13.174
Now, will you do me a favor
for one last time for a smoke?


945
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:17.312
Now who's being dramatic?
You phony bastard.


946
01:18:18.714 --> 01:18:22.417
- Go on and burn one.
- But make it quick.


947
01:18:46.007 --> 01:18:47.208
What?

948
01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:49.344
No. No!

949
01:18:50.679 --> 01:18:52.313
No!

950
01:18:52.447 --> 01:18:53.649
No!

951
01:18:53.782 --> 01:18:56.984
Damn it! Damn! God... Blubberin'.

952
01:18:57.118 --> 01:18:59.621
You do not... No!

953
01:18:59.755 --> 01:19:01.889
You hunk of shit piece...

954
01:19:02.023 --> 01:19:04.392
No! This ain't how this goes!

955
01:19:04.525 --> 01:19:06.628
- He stiffed the whore!
- Rubber Jean, wait.


956
01:19:06.762 --> 01:19:08.262
Wait for me.

957
01:19:08.396 --> 01:19:10.733
Okay. Show's over.

958
01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:13.034
Let's go.

959
01:19:16.571 --> 01:19:17.972
She's dead.

960
01:19:20.308 --> 01:19:23.611
We need to hurry up.
Gotta make it to the camp.


961
01:19:23.746 --> 01:19:24.979
Well, I don't think

962
01:19:25.113 --> 01:19:27.348
they're gonna be any more
ridiculous distractions.


963
01:19:27.482 --> 01:19:29.384
Well, let's just make sure
there are not.


964
01:19:29.517 --> 01:19:31.552
- Okeydoke.
- Let's get going.


965
01:19:32.654 --> 01:19:35.156
Huh. Goddamn.

966
01:19:35.289 --> 01:19:38.259
That was the best damn trick
I ever did see.


967
01:19:38.393 --> 01:19:43.097
How far you figure
to the garrison in Owens?


968
01:19:43.231 --> 01:19:46.234
It shouldn't be more
than a couple days' ride


969
01:19:46.367 --> 01:19:48.569
if I figured correctly.

970
01:19:48.704 --> 01:19:51.539
That is,
if we keep our shit together.


971
01:20:00.047 --> 01:20:01.215
Ah.

972
01:20:03.017 --> 01:20:05.453
So, Pearl,

973
01:20:05.586 --> 01:20:09.991
how did you come about going
after John in the first place?


974
01:20:14.529 --> 01:20:16.597
Well, boys,

975
01:20:16.732 --> 01:20:19.567
I guess I'm kinda like y'all,
in that...


976
01:20:19.701 --> 01:20:22.069
I've done my fair share
of bounty hunting


977
01:20:22.203 --> 01:20:24.238
for quite some time.

978
01:20:35.884 --> 01:20:41.322
Aw. It's like the last time
I hooked up with No Name.


979
01:20:42.523 --> 01:20:45.026
I was chasing a bounty skip
at the time


980
01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:47.028
till I was smooth talked

981
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:49.297
into spending
a better quality time


982
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:52.366
with your friend here.

983
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.101
Yee-ha!

984
01:20:59.607 --> 01:21:03.311
Well, then, Pearl, you must
tell me the whole story.


985
01:21:03.444 --> 01:21:05.747
All the gritty details.

986
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:08.983
Don't leave nothing out.

987
01:21:09.116 --> 01:21:11.285
And I think we've heard enough
about that subject tonight.


988
01:21:11.419 --> 01:21:13.789
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes.


989
01:21:13.922 --> 01:21:17.158
That's enough. I think
it's time we go to sleep.


990
01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:20.528
Oh.

991
01:22:06.374 --> 01:22:08.543
Someone's here.

992
01:22:29.497 --> 01:22:31.432
A horse is here, sir.

993
01:22:43.244 --> 01:22:44.846
Captain Forbes.

994
01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.347
Pearl.

995
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.717
Got something for you.

996
01:22:50.886 --> 01:22:52.553
Hold this, darlin'.

997
01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.326
Thank you.

998
01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:01.429
All right. Shh.

999
01:23:14.275 --> 01:23:16.778
You got John Wilkes Booth?

1000
01:23:16.912 --> 01:23:19.347
- Yee-ha!
- She got John Wilkes Booth.


1001
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.617
That's it, boys. Pack it in.
We're done.


1002
01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:29.958
Lieutenant,
take control of that body.


1003
01:23:30.092 --> 01:23:31.627
Yes, Captain.

1004
01:23:33.194 --> 01:23:37.531
Pearl, if you would be so kind
as to join me in my tent.


1005
01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:39.133
Well...

1006
01:23:43.537 --> 01:23:45.741
Hey, guys.
How did you find him?


1007
01:23:47.843 --> 01:23:51.145
How did you guys get
that son of a bitch?


1008
01:23:51.278 --> 01:23:54.582
Well, it's quite
an interesting story.


1009
01:23:54.716 --> 01:23:57.351
So, we first found John
in a cabin in the woods.


1010
01:23:57.485 --> 01:23:59.721
He come running in
like his ass was on fire.


1011
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.095
Well, thank you, Captain.

1012
01:24:07.228 --> 01:24:09.163
My pleasure, ma'am.

1013
01:24:14.335 --> 01:24:15.771
Lieutenant.

1014
01:24:17.438 --> 01:24:19.573
Fetch some peanuts,
wine, that table.


1015
01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:20.676
Yes, sir.

1016
01:24:20.809 --> 01:24:22.911
Me and No Name there
were posted up,


1017
01:24:23.045 --> 01:24:24.713
just enjoying the night
like some normal...


1018
01:24:24.846 --> 01:24:28.784
Hold on a minute there,
Dynamite. Let's go.


1019
01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:30.786
No Name. Dynamite.

1020
01:24:30.919 --> 01:24:32.486
Join me, won't you?

1021
01:24:37.626 --> 01:24:39.728
Yeah. We're like Cornwallis.

1022
01:24:39.861 --> 01:24:41.763
You know Cornwallis?

1023
01:24:41.897 --> 01:24:43.264
Yes, I do.

1024
01:24:43.397 --> 01:24:44.866
Well, gentlemen...

1025
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.168
Take this.

1026
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.203
...I think a drink is in order.

1027
01:24:50.504 --> 01:24:53.374
You gotta pour heavier
on that one. Thank you.


1028
01:24:58.747 --> 01:25:01.950
Just introduced to
the United States of America.


1029
01:25:02.084 --> 01:25:03.118
Cheers, gents.

1030
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.385
Cheers.

1031
01:25:04.518 --> 01:25:06.587
Roasted peanuts.

1032
01:25:06.722 --> 01:25:09.057
Crush those up.
Drink some wine with them.


1033
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:10.826
They're amazing.

1034
01:25:16.064 --> 01:25:17.598
Good, ain't it?

1035
01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:22.871
So, where's Pearl?

1036
01:25:29.276 --> 01:25:30.879
Pearl's not important.

1037
01:25:31.012 --> 01:25:32.914
Where's Pearl?

1038
01:25:33.048 --> 01:25:36.617
Pearl's not important.
What's important is the reward.


1039
01:25:43.324 --> 01:25:45.627
- I disagree.
- Yeah.


1040
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:49.865
For example... Dynamite, what
would you spend your reward on?


1041
01:25:51.332 --> 01:25:54.002
Well, I would spend it on buying

1042
01:25:54.136 --> 01:25:56.337
a whole lot of these peanuts
here, that's for sure.


1043
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:58.907
So at the end of the day,

1044
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.244
we're all just working
for peanuts.


1045
01:26:04.079 --> 01:26:06.514
Let me get this straight.

1046
01:26:06.648 --> 01:26:09.483
You gave the reward to Pearl,

1047
01:26:09.617 --> 01:26:11.853
and we get peanuts.

1048
01:26:15.456 --> 01:26:17.759
Horseshit.

1049
01:26:17.893 --> 01:26:20.361
- No Name, let's go.
- Hmm.


1050
01:26:24.232 --> 01:26:27.102
You know what?
This never would've happened


1051
01:26:27.235 --> 01:26:30.304
if you hadn't gotten involved
with that Pearl.


1052
01:26:33.275 --> 01:26:34.910
You're right.

1053
01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:38.880
You have fucked up.

1054
01:26:47.889 --> 01:26:49.523
Hey.

1055
01:26:50.491 --> 01:26:52.828
Stay warm, soldiers.

1056
01:28:08.069 --> 01:28:09.804
Pearl!

1057
01:28:43.571 --> 01:28:48.571
