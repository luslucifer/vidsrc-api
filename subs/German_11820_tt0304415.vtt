1
00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:19.064
All her life she had wanted
to teach at Wellesley College.


2
00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:22.276
So when a position opened
in the Art History department...


3
00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:26.196
...she pursued it single-mindedly
until she was hired.


4
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:34.121
It was whispered
that Katherine Watson...


5
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.832
...a first-year teacher
from Oakland State...


6
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.252
...made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree.


7
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.348
Which was why this bohemian
from California...


8
00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:57.853
...was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation.


9
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:00.606
-Excuse me, please.
-Oh, sorry.


10
00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:03.984
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.324
Excuse me. The bus?

12
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.201
-Keep walking, ma'am.
-Thank you.


13
00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:16.121
But Katherine Watson didn't come
to Wellesley to fit in.


14
00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:20.751
She came to Wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference.


15
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.546
-Violet.
-My favorite Italian professor.


16
00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:26.673
-Nice summer?
-Terrific, thanks.


17
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.009
-Who's that over there?
-Where?


18
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:33.847
Oh, Katherine Watson. New teacher.
Art History. I'm dying to meet her.


19
00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:38.161
Who knocks at the Door of Learning?

20
00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.874
-I am every woman.
-What do you seek?


21
00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:45.669
To awaken my spirit
through hard work...


22
00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:48.088
...and dedicate my life
to knowledge.


23
00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:49.715
Then you are welcome.

24
00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:54.970
All women who seek to follow you
can enter here.


25
00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:59.891
I now declare
the academic year begun.


26
00:04:19.078 --> 00:04:23.623
A shame you didn't come yesterday.
It's so quiet before the girls arrive.


27
00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:29.713
Just a few rules.
No holes in the walls.


28
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:34.509
No pets, no loud noises, no radio
or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...


29
00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:36.386
...10 on weekends...

30
00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:40.015
...no hot plates and no male visitors.

31
00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:43.977
Anything wrong?

32
00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:48.440
I don't think I can go a year
without a hot plate.


33
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.572
Don't you just love chintz?

34
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.616
And look.

35
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.455
They match.

36
00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:07.542
Sweet, right? Your room's here.

37
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.755
My room is just across the way...

38
00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:15.008
...and Amanda Armstrong's
down the other end.


39
00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:18.303
-You grew up here?
-My whole life.


40
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:22.307
You'll meet my parents
when they come to visit.


41
00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:25.811
-They visit?
-Regularly.


42
00:05:28.314 --> 00:05:33.985
-What do you teach?
-Speech, elocution and poise.


43
00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:36.822
Dinners are communal,
so I'll handle that.


44
00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:40.617
But breakfast and lunch,
you're on your own. So...


45
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:45.831
...we each get our own shelf.
I'll make your label this evening.


46
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.212
I don't need to tell you, everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct.


47
00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:57.717
I just knew when we met...

48
00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:01.012
...we'd be instant friends.

49
00:06:19.198 --> 00:06:23.743
Be careful. They can smell fear.

50
00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.892
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


51
00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:48.894
Thank you.

52
00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:54.524
This is History of Art 100.

53
00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:59.112
We'll be following
Dr. Staunton's syllabus.


54
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.240
-Any questions so far?
-Your name?


55
00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:05.619
-Why don't you go first?
-Connie Baker.


56
00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:10.457
-Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you.
-Dr. Watson, I presume.


57
00:07:11.584 --> 00:07:14.794
-Not yet. And you are?
-Giselle Levy.


58
00:07:14.962 --> 00:07:17.547
Giselle. If someone could get the--

59
00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:22.761
-Susan Delacorte.
-Thank you, Susan Delacorte.


60
00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:31.186
From the beginning, man has always
had the impulse to create art.


61
00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:34.773
-Can anyone tell me what this is?
-Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...


62
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:38.235
...about 15,000 B.C.
Joan Brandwyn.


63
00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:40.612
Very good, Joan.

64
00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:44.950
Despite the age of these, they are
technically sophisticated because--


65
00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:49.621
The shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison's hump.


66
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.750
-Is that right?
-Yes, that's exactly right.


67
00:07:54.502 --> 00:07:56.503
Next slide.

68
00:07:57.046 --> 00:08:01.132
This is probably less familiar.
It was discovered by archeologists--


69
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.262
In 1879, Lascaux, France.
Dates back to 10,000 B.C.


70
00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:09.724
Singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal.


71
00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:14.604
-Impressive. Name?
-Herd of Horses.


72
00:08:14.772 --> 00:08:17.983
-I meant yours.
-We call her Flicka.


73
00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:21.361
Elizabeth Warren.
They call me Betty.


74
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:23.154
Very good.

75
00:08:23.322 --> 00:08:25.991
Betty is also correct.

76
00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:30.036
Just because something is ancient
doesn't mean that it is primitive.


77
00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:32.455
For example. Next slide, please.

78
00:08:32.623 --> 00:08:35.125
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.

79
00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:37.794
It's a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen...


80
00:08:37.962 --> 00:08:42.257
...originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh's KA. Soul.


81
00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:48.763
Have any of you taken
Art History before?


82
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:51.182
No.

83
00:08:53.894 --> 00:08:56.521
Let's go on. Slide.

84
00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:59.774
Seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B.C.

85
00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:04.362
Peasant Couple Plowing.
Sixteenth century B.C. Egypt.


86
00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:08.074
Snake Goddess.
Minoan. 1600 B.C.


87
00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:10.785
Fresco. Minoan. 1600 B.C.

88
00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:13.872
Funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1200.

89
00:09:26.218 --> 00:09:27.594
Could someone please get--?

90
00:09:34.393 --> 00:09:36.061
Thank you.

91
00:09:37.605 --> 00:09:41.024
By a show of hands only...

92
00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:46.029
...how many of you have read
the entire text?


93
00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:53.870
-And the suggested supplements.
-Long way from Oakland State?


94
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:59.751
Well, you girls do prepare.

95
00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.672
If you've nothing else for us,
we could go to independent study.


96
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.216
Ac--

97
00:10:42.962 --> 00:10:49.092
I was in California once. How do you
get work done with all that sunshine?


98
00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:53.054
-We tan in class.
-Really?


99
00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:54.639
No.

100
00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:01.521
You know, not everybody
wanted you.


101
00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:04.190
I'm not naming any names.

102
00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:08.987
These jobs usually go quickly.
Ex-students, friends of, you know...


103
00:11:09.155 --> 00:11:11.489
...the right people.

104
00:11:11.657 --> 00:11:15.577
The person they wanted took a job at
Brown, and no one else was available.


105
00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:17.829
So here you are.

106
00:11:18.664 --> 00:11:22.500
You can go in now. Good luck.

107
00:11:28.507 --> 00:11:31.301
Your first class left a lot
to be desired, Miss Watson.


108
00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:35.138
And I'm curious about the subject
of your dissertation.


109
00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:40.226
You suggest, "Picasso will do
for the 20th century...


110
00:11:40.394 --> 00:11:44.355
...what Michelangelo did
for the Renaissance," unquote.


111
00:11:45.107 --> 00:11:47.567
In terms of influencing movements.

112
00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:50.945
So these canvases that
they're turning out these days...


113
00:11:51.113 --> 00:11:54.199
...with paint dripped
and splotched on them...


114
00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:59.329
...they're as worthy of our attention
as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?


115
00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:01.664
I'm not comparing them.

116
00:12:01.832 --> 00:12:05.460
Have you ever seen
the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?


117
00:12:05.628 --> 00:12:07.629
Actually stood there?

118
00:12:09.256 --> 00:12:11.132
I've never been to Europe.

119
00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:19.224
I can assure all of you this is the place
I want to be more than anything.


120
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:23.895
Better discipline next class,
Miss Watson.


121
00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:31.444
-Hello.
-It's me.


122
00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:34.656
-Hey!
-Collect from Katherine Watson.


123
00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:38.409
-Will you accept?
-Yeah, sure, of course I will.


124
00:12:39.036 --> 00:12:41.246
Hey, is everything okay?

125
00:12:42.498 --> 00:12:43.498
Yeah.

126
00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:46.417
Tough, huh?

127
00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:52.006
Well, how are the classes?

128
00:12:52.633 --> 00:12:54.592
Snobs, right?

129
00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:59.973
-I hate to say I told you so.
-You don't have to.


130
00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:08.648
I can't really talk right now.

131
00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:11.776
I'll write you tonight.

132
00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:17.448
So you got a fella?

133
00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:22.120
He's-
- He's there. I'm here.

134
00:13:22.288 --> 00:13:27.792
Long distance. Torture. I know.
Come. Come in and sit down.


135
00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:35.633
When Lenny left for the South Pacific,
it nearly broke my heart.


136
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:38.511
We wrote every day until....

137
00:13:41.181 --> 00:13:43.308
He was a great man.

138
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.020
-I'm sorry.
-It was a hundred years ago.


139
00:13:47.187 --> 00:13:48.980
I'm babbling.

140
00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:56.279
I love Lucy.
Even if she is a communist.


141
00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:59.324
The only thing red about Lucy
is her hair.


142
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:01.951
And even that's fake. Desi said it.

143
00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.037
Winchell wrote it.

144
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.749
Amanda Armstrong.
I see you survived.


145
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:09.792
Katherine Watson. Just barely.

146
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.087
Oh, good. You've met.
Katherine's taken the third bedroom.


147
00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:16.257
How about a little dinner
before What's My Line?


148
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:19.844
How about a little drink?

149
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.016
Her companion died in May.

150
00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:26.893
Companion?

151
00:14:27.728 --> 00:14:30.104
You know, companion.

152
00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:37.236
Josephine Burns.
Taught biology here for 30 years.


153
00:14:40.616 --> 00:14:43.743
You'll love it here, Katherine.
You'll see.


154
00:14:43.911 --> 00:14:48.873
I already do. I-- Honestly,
it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.


155
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:53.586
Well, don't fool yourself. They have
claws underneath their white gloves.


156
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.381
Who?

157
00:14:57.174 --> 00:15:01.719
The alumnae, their offspring,
the faculty. You name it.


158
00:15:02.054 --> 00:15:03.888
Watch out for yourself.

159
00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:06.099
Too much independence
frightens them.


160
00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:10.061
-Will you please stop?
-Oh, a word of advice.


161
00:15:10.229 --> 00:15:13.606
Don't let those girls
know that they got to you.


162
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.195
-They didn't.
-Good for you.


163
00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.907
You almost convinced me.

164
00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:56.190
-What is that?
-You tell me.


165
00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:03.448
Carcass by Soutine. 1925.

166
00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:07.910
-It's not on the syllabus.
-No, it's not.


167
00:16:09.913 --> 00:16:12.165
Is it any good?

168
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:22.050
Come on, ladies.
There's no wrong answer.


169
00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:25.720
There's also no textbook
telling you what to think.


170
00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:28.806
It's not that easy, is it?

171
00:16:29.892 --> 00:16:32.226
All right. No. 
It's not good.

172
00:16:32.394 --> 00:16:35.188
In fact, I wouldn't even call it art.
It's grotesque.


173
00:16:35.397 --> 00:16:37.273
Is there a rule against
grotesque art?


174
00:16:37.483 --> 00:16:40.943
I think there's something
aggressive about it...


175
00:16:41.653 --> 00:16:44.822
-...and erotic.
-To you, everything is erotic.


176
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.408
-Everything is erotic.
-Girls.


177
00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:49.827
-Aren't there standards?
-Of course.


178
00:16:49.995 --> 00:16:53.331
Otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a Rembrandt.


179
00:16:53.499 --> 00:16:57.710
My Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings. He loves those clowns.


180
00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:03.633
There are standards, technique,
composition, color, even subject.


181
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:06.803
So if you're suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art...


182
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.139
...much less good art,
then what are we going to learn?


183
00:17:11.308 --> 00:17:12.850
Just that.

184
00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:16.604
You have outlined our new syllabus,
Betty. Thank you.


185
00:17:16.772 --> 00:17:19.690
What is art?
What makes it good or bad?


186
00:17:19.858 --> 00:17:21.818
And who decides?

187
00:17:22.778 --> 00:17:24.237
Next slide, please.

188
00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:29.367
Twenty-five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant.


189
00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:31.786
-I can see that.
-Who?


190
00:17:31.954 --> 00:17:35.498
My mother. I painted it
for her birthday.


191
00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:39.877
Next slide. This is my mom.

192
00:17:40.462 --> 00:17:43.756
-Is it art?
-It's a snapshot.


193
00:17:43.924 --> 00:17:47.885
If I told you Ansel Adams had taken it,
would that make a difference?


194
00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:53.349
-Art isn't art until someone says it is.
-It's art!


195
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:57.353
-The right people.
-Who are they?


196
00:17:57.563 --> 00:17:58.896
Betty Warren!

197
00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:02.650
-We're lucky we have one right here.
-Screw you.


198
00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:06.821
Could you go back
to the Soutine, please?


199
00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:13.202
Just look at it again.
Look beyond the paint.


200
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.249
Let us try to open our minds
to a new idea.


201
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.256
All right, back to chapter three.
Has anyone read it?


202
00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:28.551
Okay.

203
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.891
"When your courses are set,
and a dream boat you've met...


204
00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:37.101
...have a real cigarette.
Have a Camel."


205
00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:41.272
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel
cigarette. Where is my dream boat?


206
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.984
-Giselle, where is my dream boat?
-Betty's cousin isn't good enough?


207
00:18:45.152 --> 00:18:47.195
-I haven't met him.
-Don't encourage her.


208
00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:49.947
He's only escorting
Connie as a favor.


209
00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:52.033
Why are you like this?

210
00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:54.785
I didn't mean that.

211
00:18:54.953 --> 00:18:57.622
I'm just under so much pressure
with the wedding.


212
00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:00.791
Do you realize November 2nd
is three weeks from now?


213
00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:02.877
-Oh, honey.
-Don't have it.


214
00:19:03.045 --> 00:19:04.670
-Don't come.
-Here. Here.


215
00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:08.049
I'm working on table seating now,
so I can just erase your name.


216
00:19:08.217 --> 00:19:09.467
-Can I see it?
-No.


217
00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:11.677
Let me look.
I can't look for a second?


218
00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:15.264
-You want to see where Bill is sitting.
-No. That is over. Right?


219
00:19:15.432 --> 00:19:18.100
Right? Giselle, right?

220
00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:21.646
Damn it.

221
00:19:27.653 --> 00:19:31.155
-Do I look a little bit like her?
-Like who?


222
00:19:31.657 --> 00:19:35.117
-Katherine Watson.
-You mean, "crap is art"?


223
00:19:35.827 --> 00:19:40.122
-I think she's fabulous.
-Well, no man wanted her.


224
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.668
-She isn't dead.
-She's at least 30.


225
00:19:43.835 --> 00:19:46.921
-Oh, no. No.
-I guess she never wanted children.


226
00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:49.006
For your information...

227
00:19:49.174 --> 00:19:55.221
...Katherine Watson had to take
this job to escape from California.


228
00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:57.181
Please.

229
00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:01.269
She had a torrid affair
with a Hollywood movie star.


230
00:20:01.436 --> 00:20:05.773
-She came here to get away.
-That's ridiculous.


231
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:08.693
-Who was it?
-I don't know.


232
00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:11.737
Who was it, Giselle?
Don't be a pimple! Tell me!


233
00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:14.615
-It's ridiculous.
-Tell me. No, it's not. You know.


234
00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:18.411
-You know something. Tell me.
-It's William Holden.


235
00:20:19.871 --> 00:20:21.622
-Fantastic!
-I know.


236
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.416
Who is it?

237
00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:26.794
William Holden.

238
00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:39.515
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm-- Abject
pleading, apologies, forgiveness.


239
00:20:39.808 --> 00:20:41.350
Is she giving you any trouble?

240
00:20:41.518 --> 00:20:45.229
If these girls can't get back on time,
know what I say? Lock them out.


241
00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:50.901
Come on. Out! I'm going
to lock the door. Out!


242
00:20:51.194 --> 00:20:56.490
Bedtime, ladies. Bedtime.
Let's go. Bedtime.


243
00:20:57.075 --> 00:20:59.201
-Hey, Betty.
-Quiet time, ladies.


244
00:20:59.369 --> 00:21:01.787
Women like Katherine Watson
don't get married...


245
00:21:01.955 --> 00:21:04.999
-...because they choose not to.
-No woman chooses to live...


246
00:21:05.167 --> 00:21:08.586
...without a home, unless she's
sleeping with her Italian professor.


247
00:21:08.754 --> 00:21:10.921
-You are so critical.
-I am not.


248
00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:13.591
Of course you are.
You're your mother's daughter.


249
00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:15.551
It's a classic Electra complex.

250
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:18.304
I don't blame you. I mean...

251
00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:20.639
...who wouldn't want
to murder your mother?


252
00:21:20.807 --> 00:21:24.018
-Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart?
-Divine.


253
00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.270
Got an extra ciggie?

254
00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:28.272
-Did you do his homework?
-Of course.


255
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.442
-Want to do mine?
-No.


256
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:38.491
This isn't what I
think it is. Is it?

257
00:21:40.786 --> 00:21:42.078
Where'd you get it?

258
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:46.290
From the school nurse.

259
00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:51.879
-It's against the law.
-Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.


260
00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:56.550
-A certain kind of girl.
-Meet the last virgin bride.


261
00:21:57.886 --> 00:22:01.972
-Spencer is a gentleman.
-And even gentlemen have dicks.


262
00:22:06.186 --> 00:22:09.188
-Maybe I'll get one.
-What? A dick?


263
00:22:09.356 --> 00:22:11.607
Don't be stupid, Connie.

264
00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:17.488
Someone, somewhere,
someday might be interested.


265
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.785
Just in case.
Just in case, I'll be prepared.


266
00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:28.249
Was that necessary?

267
00:22:28.417 --> 00:22:30.668
I was taught it's best
to speak honestly.


268
00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:33.712
Okay. You're a bitch.

269
00:22:40.762 --> 00:22:43.431
We recently learned
that Amanda Armstrong...


270
00:22:43.598 --> 00:22:48.561
...our nurse, has been distributing
contraception to Wellesley girls.


271
00:22:48.728 --> 00:22:51.522
This revelation is disturbing
to an institution...


272
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.316
...that prides itself on propriety.

273
00:23:05.203 --> 00:23:10.374
Go, go, go! Go, go!
It's been going on since the late '80s.


274
00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:14.253
-Whoever wins is first to marry!
-Do the girls take it literally?


275
00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:19.258
Only the girl with the winning hoop.
Oh, look, it's Phyllis Nayor!


276
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.348
Good for her. It gets me every time.

277
00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:29.101
-Why the buggies?
-They've got their man.


278
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:31.770
They're wishing for their babies.

279
00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:37.902
Have you seen this?

280
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.488
What is it?

281
00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:45.910
It's a front-page attack on Amanda
Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.


282
00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:55.544
"By providing contraception
on demand, our school nurse...


283
00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:58.756
...is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity." Wow.


284
00:23:58.924 --> 00:24:02.259
Oh, they're not going to dump her
in a lake!


285
00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:06.639
-I'm coming, Phyllis!
-Have you seen this?


286
00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:10.017
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just
a young girl flexing her muscles.


287
00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:12.978
So was Lizzie Borden,
and her mother wasn't president...


288
00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:16.941
-...of the alumnae association.
-Would somebody get that girl a towel!


289
00:24:17.108 --> 00:24:20.194
-That's her mother?
-Apple, tree.


290
00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:22.530
Is Amanda going to get into trouble?

291
00:24:22.697 --> 00:24:25.574
Amanda needs to start
minding her p's and q's.


292
00:24:25.742 --> 00:24:28.661
The trick to surviving Wellesley
is never getting noticed.


293
00:24:28.828 --> 00:24:30.913
Ciao, Mona Lisa.

294
00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:33.999
The big war hero.

295
00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:36.627
He thinks he's something special.

296
00:24:37.837 --> 00:24:40.589
He sleeps with his students.

297
00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:45.261
The gold is fine.
The napkin rings are vulgar.


298
00:24:45.428 --> 00:24:47.721
The glassware should be trimmed
with gold.


299
00:24:47.889 --> 00:24:52.351
The little sugar boxes, gold and white,
filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.


300
00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:55.396
-Freesia instead of daisies.
-Wise choice, madam.


301
00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:58.148
No baby's breath.

302
00:25:03.446 --> 00:25:06.782
-You already had your fitting?
-We're on our way.


303
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.494
Here's the seating chart
and Spencer's list of groomsmen.


304
00:25:10.662 --> 00:25:12.746
Oh, I almost forgot.

305
00:25:13.123 --> 00:25:17.459
I spoke to him about reading the
poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.


306
00:25:19.087 --> 00:25:21.547
Excuse us for a second, Joan.

307
00:25:26.886 --> 00:25:30.222
A good wife lets her husband
think that everything's his idea...


308
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.058
-...even when it's not.
-I don't care if he reads it.


309
00:25:33.226 --> 00:25:35.311
You will in retrospect.

310
00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:42.026
Now, why don't you see if you
can't nudge the idea into his head?


311
00:25:47.282 --> 00:25:51.160
I've been here now
for 21 years, Jocelyn.


312
00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:54.455
-I remember you as a student.
-Twenty-four, if you count that.


313
00:25:54.623 --> 00:25:56.665
So why the theatrics?

314
00:25:57.083 --> 00:26:01.253
We cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity.


315
00:26:01.421 --> 00:26:04.798
Okay. It's about appearances, then?
No.


316
00:26:04.966 --> 00:26:07.217
All right, all right.

317
00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:12.264
All right. Well, I promise not to appear
to be sympathetic, progressive...


318
00:26:12.432 --> 00:26:16.060
...or what did Mrs. Warren
call it? "Liberal."


319
00:26:16.645 --> 00:26:18.520
Scout's honor.

320
00:26:19.939 --> 00:26:23.400
I spent the better part of Friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae...


321
00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:25.444
...that your record was impeccable...

322
00:26:25.612 --> 00:26:29.865
...that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices...


323
00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:32.701
...and you'd make
a public statement to that effect.


324
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:34.995
I'm not willing to make
a public statement.


325
00:26:35.163 --> 00:26:37.498
It doesn't matter, Amanda.

326
00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:42.044
They're letting you go.

327
00:26:45.298 --> 00:26:47.508
It's out of my hands.

328
00:26:50.804 --> 00:26:53.097
And this champagne cup
is in the wrong place.


329
00:26:53.264 --> 00:26:56.934
And up and down. And up and--

330
00:26:57.102 --> 00:26:59.645
Katherine. Good evening,
Miss Watson.


331
00:26:59.813 --> 00:27:02.147
-Good evening, Miss Watson.
-Join us.


332
00:27:06.111 --> 00:27:07.444
No.

333
00:27:07.612 --> 00:27:10.114
-Good night, Miss Watson.
-Good night, Miss Watson.


334
00:27:10.281 --> 00:27:12.533
And down. Very nice. Very nice.

335
00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:29.967
Hey.

336
00:27:31.803 --> 00:27:35.180
Heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.

337
00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:38.434
She seemed all right about it.
I wouldn't be.


338
00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:41.019
They don't give you
too many chances around here.


339
00:27:41.187 --> 00:27:44.106
Oh, that depends how much
they hate you to begin with.


340
00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:48.569
Can I buy you a drink?
Or are you here for dinner?


341
00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:51.155
How long do
the marriage lectures take?


342
00:27:51.322 --> 00:27:53.490
Get this woman a booth.

343
00:28:08.173 --> 00:28:11.383
Your husband is at a crossroads
in his career.


344
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:18.599
He's competing for promotion
against two rivals, Smith and Jones.


345
00:28:19.642 --> 00:28:24.271
To get the edge, you have wisely
decided to invite the boss...


346
00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:27.483
...and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.

347
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.360
You've carefully planned
your meal...


348
00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:33.864
...set your table
and arranged for a babysitter.


349
00:28:34.032 --> 00:28:36.992
-Oh, we have babies!
-Yes, and I have twins!


350
00:28:39.037 --> 00:28:41.789
Then, surprise. It's 6:15...

351
00:28:41.956 --> 00:28:46.502
...and your husband's called to say
that Smith, Jones and their wives...


352
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:49.296
...have been invited
at the boss's request.


353
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.552
Ever the Wellesley girl...

354
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.263
...you keep your cool
and understand...


355
00:28:58.431 --> 00:29:02.893
...that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband. What next?


356
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:06.146
-Yes?
-File for divorce?


357
00:29:08.566 --> 00:29:10.984
That's very funny.

358
00:29:11.152 --> 00:29:14.071
But the thing is, it's not a joke.

359
00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:17.282
A few years from now
your sole responsibility...


360
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.994
...will be taking care
of your husband and children.


361
00:29:23.957 --> 00:29:26.917
You may all be here...

362
00:29:27.085 --> 00:29:29.127
...for an easy A...

363
00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:34.383
...but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you, not me.


364
00:29:35.093 --> 00:29:38.220
-You'll need to--
-Whatever you do...


365
00:29:38.388 --> 00:29:40.806
...don't put the boss's wife
next to your husband.


366
00:29:40.974 --> 00:29:44.726
-Why not?
-She's screwing him.


367
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.439
Is that where you learned
to speak Italian? In Italy?


368
00:29:49.607 --> 00:29:51.108
Yeah.

369
00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.989
-Have you got a boyfriend?
-Yes.


370
00:29:59.284 --> 00:30:01.743
You know, if you were mine,
I'd never let you go.


371
00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:04.288
I wouldn't have asked
your permission.


372
00:30:06.332 --> 00:30:08.500
Yeah, they say you're progressive.

373
00:30:09.002 --> 00:30:10.794
A forward thinker.

374
00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:14.464
-Are you?
-There are a lot of labels here...


375
00:30:14.883 --> 00:30:16.341
...I've noticed.

376
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:22.347
Right family, right school, right art,
right way of thinking.


377
00:30:22.807 --> 00:30:25.350
Well, saves the effort
on thinking for yourself.


378
00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:29.980
How do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke?


379
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.068
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to
Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.


380
00:30:37.322 --> 00:30:41.575
-Thank you for the drink.
-No, no. Wait. I was teasing.


381
00:30:42.368 --> 00:30:44.828
They have their own way
of doing things here.


382
00:30:45.121 --> 00:30:49.458
You just gotta find a way
to work with them. We all had to.


383
00:31:01.012 --> 00:31:02.846
I'm sorry.

384
00:31:04.933 --> 00:31:08.101
Five years ago,
they'd have slapped my wrist.


385
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:12.397
But now there's a committee
for the protection of everything.


386
00:31:14.233 --> 00:31:16.068
They think you're dangerous?

387
00:31:16.235 --> 00:31:20.447
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.

388
00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:23.992
It's gotten to the point...

389
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.537
...where you don't know
who is protecting whom from what.


390
00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:34.711
Or should that be "from whom"?
Well, whom gives a damn anyway?


391
00:31:35.213 --> 00:31:37.923
They're doing me a favor really.

392
00:31:40.218 --> 00:31:41.927
Will you be all right?

393
00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:47.432
Better than that.

394
00:31:51.604 --> 00:31:56.274
I should really have left
when Josephine died.


395
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.656
Nothing left to love
here anymore. So....


396
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.089
Hello?

397
00:32:20.299 --> 00:32:23.218
-Miss Watson?
-Yes. I'm back here.


398
00:32:24.804 --> 00:32:29.349
I've never been to this part
of campus before. Where are we?


399
00:32:30.184 --> 00:32:34.438
No man's land. So to speak.

400
00:32:37.233 --> 00:32:38.942
Come on in.

401
00:32:39.777 --> 00:32:41.403
What's all this?

402
00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:44.281
Different things different days.

403
00:32:44.449 --> 00:32:50.787
People who inspire me,
artists I admire, editorials I don't.


404
00:32:51.122 --> 00:32:54.416
So you came to see me.

405
00:32:55.293 --> 00:32:58.295
-You gave me a C.
-I'm kind.


406
00:32:58.629 --> 00:33:01.465
The assignment was to write
about Bruegel. I did that.


407
00:33:01.924 --> 00:33:05.469
-No, what you did was copy Strauss.
-I was referencing an expert.


408
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.639
If I wanted to know what he thought,
I'd buy his book.


409
00:33:13.102 --> 00:33:15.812
Miss Watson, with all due respect....

410
00:33:17.607 --> 00:33:19.858
Bruegel was a storyteller.
Find the stories.


411
00:33:20.026 --> 00:33:24.112
Break them down into smaller pieces.
You might actually enjoy it.


412
00:33:25.073 --> 00:33:29.076
-You're giving me another chance?
-So it seems.


413
00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:34.206
Is that my file? 
What's it say?

414
00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:38.043
Well, let's see.

415
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.756
-Straight A's.
-Until now.


416
00:33:44.008 --> 00:33:47.677
President of the poetry society,
captain of the debate team...


417
00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:51.556
...co-captain of the tennis club,
founder of the horticulture league.


418
00:33:51.724 --> 00:33:56.186
-I sound like a pompous ass.
-Yes, you do, but a very busy one.


419
00:33:56.354 --> 00:34:01.191
And it says here that you're pre-law.
What law school are you gonna go to?


420
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:05.112
I hadn't thought about that.
After I graduate, I'm getting married.


421
00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:09.074
-And then?
-And then I'll be married.


422
00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:11.201
You can do both.

423
00:34:11.494 --> 00:34:16.289
Just for fun, if you could go
to any law school, which would it be?


424
00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:20.544
Yale.

425
00:34:20.711 --> 00:34:25.632
They keep five slots open for women,
one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.


426
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.635
But you haven't really
thought about it.


427
00:34:46.237 --> 00:34:50.615
Wake up, Joanie, wake up.
Wake up.


428
00:34:51.576 --> 00:34:52.909
Okay, don't get up.

429
00:34:53.077 --> 00:34:55.954
Don't hear what I have to say
about Tommy and Spencer...


430
00:34:56.122 --> 00:34:59.416
...looking at an engagement ring...

431
00:34:59.584 --> 00:35:01.001
...for you.

432
00:35:02.753 --> 00:35:04.254
You're sure?

433
00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:06.631
That's everything
we always wanted, huh?


434
00:35:06.799 --> 00:35:10.260
We'll be best friends, and our
husbands will be best friends...


435
00:35:10.428 --> 00:35:13.805
...and we'll have houses together
and we'll have babies together...


436
00:35:13.973 --> 00:35:16.099
...and they'll be best friends.

437
00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:19.269
You're going to be
Mrs. Tommy Donegal.


438
00:35:19.645 --> 00:35:20.770
When?

439
00:35:20.938 --> 00:35:25.233
I'll get the scoop tomorrow.
You go back to sleep.


440
00:35:26.235 --> 00:35:30.197
The first part of the exam
will consist of two pairs of slides.


441
00:35:30.364 --> 00:35:34.451
Please identify each of the slides
by name, period and date.


442
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:36.620
Then compare and contrast them.

443
00:35:36.787 --> 00:35:39.122
You will have 10 minutes
for each pair.


444
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.666
Then you will write
a 1500-word essay...


445
00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:46.171
...describing the stylistic differences
between Raphael and van Eyck.


446
00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:49.007
Eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.

447
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.927
You have 40 minutes.

448
00:35:52.094 --> 00:35:53.595
Good luck.

449
00:36:10.446 --> 00:36:12.822
-Excuse me.
-Governor. Another shot, please.


450
00:36:15.493 --> 00:36:17.869
This way, please. Thank you.

451
00:36:37.348 --> 00:36:38.682
Excuse me.

452
00:36:45.314 --> 00:36:47.691
This is quite the event.

453
00:36:47.858 --> 00:36:51.820
-I'm surprised I was invited.
-Well, look around you.


454
00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:53.613
Who wasn't?

455
00:36:58.286 --> 00:37:01.288
You ever hear the expression
"Keeping up with the Joneses"?


456
00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:02.706
Of course.

457
00:37:02.873 --> 00:37:04.624
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Jones.

458
00:37:04.792 --> 00:37:09.045
The actual, historical family
they invented the phrase about.


459
00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:13.091
Good to know.

460
00:37:35.948 --> 00:37:37.240
That's him!

461
00:38:20.868 --> 00:38:23.953
-Thank you.
-Good to see you.


462
00:38:25.122 --> 00:38:27.874
-Thank you very much.
-A beautiful dress.


463
00:38:28.042 --> 00:38:30.418
Hi, we're so glad you came.

464
00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:33.254
-We're together. Table 19.
-Good.


465
00:38:35.007 --> 00:38:36.966
Holy God!

466
00:38:37.134 --> 00:38:40.845
The governor is right behind you.
Don't turn around.


467
00:38:44.016 --> 00:38:45.725
Great band.

468
00:38:48.646 --> 00:38:50.188
-Violet.
-Yes?


469
00:38:50.356 --> 00:38:52.524
-Would you mind if I go here?
-Not at all.


470
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:54.401
Over here. Thank you.

471
00:38:57.113 --> 00:39:00.448
-Great band.
-Great band.


472
00:39:00.783 --> 00:39:03.243
-Hi, Katherine.
-Hi, Professor Dunbar.


473
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.498
I'm getting a Manhattan.
Like anything?


474
00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:10.417
No, thank you.

475
00:39:10.584 --> 00:39:12.836
I'll take a Jack and ginger.

476
00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:18.091
He's making his move.

477
00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:22.929
I knew he'd go for her.

478
00:39:23.097 --> 00:39:25.515
She's too old for him.

479
00:39:25.683 --> 00:39:27.892
She's too smart for him.

480
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.352
Hold that.

481
00:39:41.031 --> 00:39:43.116
-They're playing our song.
-What?


482
00:39:43.284 --> 00:39:46.536
-They're playing our song.
-I heard you.


483
00:39:46.704 --> 00:39:49.747
-Hi.
-Hi, Giselle.


484
00:39:52.376 --> 00:39:54.252
-Ladies' choice?
-Sure.


485
00:39:55.546 --> 00:39:57.172
Excuse me.

486
00:40:05.431 --> 00:40:09.058
Ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!

487
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.312
What's this about the poem
you wanted me to read?


488
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.482
-It was your idea, remember?
-I never said that.


489
00:40:15.649 --> 00:40:17.192
Ready?

490
00:40:18.986 --> 00:40:19.986
Excellent.

491
00:40:20.821 --> 00:40:25.241
Well, I wrote this down, just in case
you forgot. It's my favorite.


492
00:40:25.993 --> 00:40:27.577
Smile.

493
00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:38.338
Now, Betty, I tried to think of
a million ways to tell you how I feel.


494
00:40:38.506 --> 00:40:40.590
But instead...

495
00:40:41.383 --> 00:40:44.093
...I refer to your favorite poem.

496
00:40:53.854 --> 00:40:56.606
-Good catch.
-You said it.


497
00:40:58.859 --> 00:41:01.027
He's a morsel. Miss Watson!

498
00:41:01.195 --> 00:41:03.905
-He's a favor. Remember?
-Come on.


499
00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:07.075
Miss Watson,
I want you to meet Tommy.


500
00:41:07.243 --> 00:41:09.369
Tommy, come here for a second.

501
00:41:10.913 --> 00:41:13.498
You are so beautiful.

502
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.835
-This is Katherine Watson.
-Oh, wow! In the flesh.


503
00:41:18.003 --> 00:41:21.714
-She has not shut up about you.
-Oh, stop.


504
00:41:21.882 --> 00:41:24.467
-You know what I'm saying?
-I do.


505
00:41:24.635 --> 00:41:28.388
-You did something to impress her.
-Well, it seems you did too.


506
00:41:31.183 --> 00:41:35.645
-You make these especially well.
-Thank you.


507
00:41:36.397 --> 00:41:39.232
I had a fella. Lenny.

508
00:41:40.317 --> 00:41:44.862
You remind me of him so much.

509
00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:48.157
He had this...

510
00:41:48.701 --> 00:41:51.786
...funny little thing
where his two front teeth...


511
00:41:51.954 --> 00:41:53.997
...they overlapped.

512
00:41:56.834 --> 00:41:58.459
He's dead.

513
00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:02.880
South Pacific.

514
00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:26.029
My parents say my future
is right on the horizon.


515
00:42:26.196 --> 00:42:28.573
Tell them the horizon
is an imaginary line...


516
00:42:28.741 --> 00:42:30.825
...that recedes as you approach it.

517
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:36.205
I think I'll go back to my seat.

518
00:42:36.373 --> 00:42:39.375
I had a really nice time. Thank you.

519
00:42:40.878 --> 00:42:42.211
Connie.

520
00:42:43.172 --> 00:42:46.007
-Is this the brushoff?
-No.


521
00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:48.551
I thought you were, you know...

522
00:42:48.719 --> 00:42:50.678
...done with me.

523
00:42:52.097 --> 00:42:56.559
-Why would you think that?
-Betty said that you--


524
00:42:56.727 --> 00:43:02.106
I don't wanna take advantage.
I know that this was some favor.


525
00:43:02.274 --> 00:43:05.568
She did me the favor, not you.

526
00:43:06.487 --> 00:43:08.655
Come on, dance with me.

527
00:43:38.727 --> 00:43:41.020
She's too good for you.

528
00:43:42.606 --> 00:43:44.357
Maybe you're right.

529
00:43:45.943 --> 00:43:48.778
I'm too good for you too.

530
00:43:49.738 --> 00:43:54.784
-But I have lower expectations.
-I thought we settled this last spring.


531
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.539
So then we probably shouldn't have
slept together over the summer.


532
00:43:59.873 --> 00:44:01.374
Stop.

533
00:44:04.837 --> 00:44:06.379
You ready?

534
00:44:06.797 --> 00:44:09.716
Do you wanna know something funny?

535
00:44:09.883 --> 00:44:12.468
Lenny's not dead.

536
00:44:12.928 --> 00:44:15.596
Not technically.

537
00:44:15.764 --> 00:44:17.056
He....

538
00:44:17.224 --> 00:44:18.725
He's got married.

539
00:44:18.892 --> 00:44:22.145
He's got a wife and kids...

540
00:44:22.688 --> 00:44:24.230
...and a mortgage.

541
00:44:24.398 --> 00:44:28.151
It was all supposed to be mine,
except for the wife.


542
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.990
And you....
You don't look a thing like him.


543
00:44:34.158 --> 00:44:35.950
-You ugly bartender.
-Stop it.


544
00:44:36.118 --> 00:44:39.912
-You couldn't shine his shoes.
-I'm sorry.


545
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:46.252
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.


546
00:44:47.296 --> 00:44:50.298
-Which way?
-Let me just see here.


547
00:44:50.466 --> 00:44:52.383
I'm not sure.

548
00:44:52.968 --> 00:44:56.220
-Where are we supposed to go?
-I think it's here.


549
00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:58.639
Come this way. 
We're almost there.

550
00:45:12.654 --> 00:45:13.988
Joe.

551
00:45:14.573 --> 00:45:16.991
-Hello.
-Hi. How are you?


552
00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:19.535
Great. Thank you so much for this.
You're a pal.


553
00:45:19.703 --> 00:45:21.788
It's a pleasure.
Your timing is perfect.


554
00:45:24.124 --> 00:45:26.000
There it is.

555
00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:02.078
-That's Jackson Pollock.
-In a word.


556
00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:06.707
I was getting used to the idea of dead,
maggoty meat being art, now this.


557
00:46:07.668 --> 00:46:10.711
Please don't tell me
we have to write a paper about it.


558
00:46:10.879 --> 00:46:12.296
Do me a favor.

559
00:46:12.464 --> 00:46:15.883
Do yourselves a favor.
Stop talking and look.


560
00:46:16.468 --> 00:46:21.514
You're not required to write a paper.
You're not even required to like it.


561
00:46:21.682 --> 00:46:23.933
You are required...

562
00:46:24.101 --> 00:46:25.810
...to consider it.

563
00:46:25.978 --> 00:46:30.690
That's your only assignment today.
When you're done, you may leave.


564
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.778
Thank God Betty isn't here.

565
00:47:31.668 --> 00:47:33.711
Where did you come from?

566
00:47:33.879 --> 00:47:35.504
Mars.

567
00:47:36.757 --> 00:47:38.925
What a coincidence.

568
00:47:39.927 --> 00:47:45.890
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan.
So I hopped a ride.


569
00:47:46.266 --> 00:47:47.934
Why?

570
00:47:50.479 --> 00:47:52.563
So I could do this:

571
00:48:08.664 --> 00:48:10.873
-Katherine.
-Yes?


572
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:13.501
-Have you got a minute?
-Of course.


573
00:48:13.669 --> 00:48:15.211
Walk with me.

574
00:48:16.004 --> 00:48:18.381
-You going home for the holidays?
-No.


575
00:48:18.548 --> 00:48:20.341
-Too far?
-Too expensive.


576
00:48:20.509 --> 00:48:23.052
But I've never had
a New England Christmas, so....


577
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.931
-Our weather hasn't scared you away?
-I love it here.


578
00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:28.432
Do you?

579
00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:32.770
I've been getting some calls about
your teaching methods, Katherine.


580
00:48:32.938 --> 00:48:36.440
They're a little unorthodox...

581
00:48:36.608 --> 00:48:38.734
...for Wellesley.

582
00:48:38.902 --> 00:48:42.238
-We are traditionalists, Katherine.
-Yes, I noticed.


583
00:48:42.406 --> 00:48:44.907
So if you'd like to stay here....

584
00:48:45.075 --> 00:48:48.244
-Is that a question?
-More a discussion.


585
00:48:48.412 --> 00:48:52.790
-About my staying here?
-You'll have your formal review in May.


586
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.459
Until then...

587
00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:59.255
...a little less modern art.

588
00:48:59.423 --> 00:49:01.340
Happy holidays.

589
00:49:01.508 --> 00:49:03.134
And to you.

590
00:49:09.266 --> 00:49:11.684
-Afternoon.
-Oh, hi--


591
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:18.941
I hope you get that ring!

592
00:49:19.276 --> 00:49:22.945
Bye, girls, see you next year.
Have a safe trip.


593
00:49:31.038 --> 00:49:34.123
So, what's the big hush-hush secret?

594
00:49:34.291 --> 00:49:37.668
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of little Spencers?


595
00:49:37.836 --> 00:49:40.087
Stop. They'll tell us
when they're ready.


596
00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:41.881
Are you ready?

597
00:49:42.049 --> 00:49:45.760
Is she the cutest? You are the cutest.
Come here, you.


598
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.642
Spencer's been made junior partner.

599
00:49:54.478 --> 00:49:58.606
-It is about time.
-And it's a significant raise too!


600
00:49:58.774 --> 00:50:01.734
-Betty!
-What? I can say that, can't I?


601
00:50:01.902 --> 00:50:03.819
To Tommy and Joan?

602
00:50:03.987 --> 00:50:09.408
Well, it is.
So maybe a family isn't far behind.


603
00:50:10.494 --> 00:50:13.162
Let's take our coffee
in the sitting room, shall we?


604
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.330
I'll help.

605
00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:21.128
-Keep them closed.
-All right.


606
00:50:26.009 --> 00:50:29.345
Beautiful! You've got everything
you've ever dreamed of.


607
00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:31.305
You will too.

608
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:36.685
I've got a secret to tell you.
You swear you won't gab to anyone?


609
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.397
I got accepted early
to Yale Law School.


610
00:50:40.565 --> 00:50:44.985
To what?! Why?!
You don't want to be a lawyer.


611
00:50:45.153 --> 00:50:46.904
Maybe I do.

612
00:50:47.197 --> 00:50:51.450
You won't switch cold creams without
asking me, but you applied to school?


613
00:50:51.618 --> 00:50:54.370
On a lark.
We never thought I'd get in.


614
00:50:54.538 --> 00:50:56.539
-Who's "we"?
-Miss Watson.


615
00:50:56.706 --> 00:50:59.875
She practically filled out
my application for me.


616
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.379
You've got to be kidding me!
What right does she have?


617
00:51:03.547 --> 00:51:05.172
You're getting married!

618
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.217
First of all,
there's no ring on this finger.


619
00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:11.887
Second, I can do both. I can.

620
00:51:12.389 --> 00:51:15.766
-How does Tommy feel about this?
-He doesn't know. No one does.


621
00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:18.978
-Not even her?
-No one.


622
00:51:19.146 --> 00:51:20.688
Joanie! Betty!

623
00:51:20.856 --> 00:51:23.816
You are this close to getting
everything you ever wanted.


624
00:51:23.984 --> 00:51:26.068
And this close to losing it.

625
00:51:37.914 --> 00:51:40.583
I just got a call.
They need me in New York tomorrow.


626
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:43.544
Joan and Tommy are here.
Can't you leave in the morning?


627
00:51:43.712 --> 00:51:47.590
Then I'd miss the meeting.
Sorry, guys. We take a rain check?


628
00:51:47.757 --> 00:51:50.050
-Sure, buddy.
-We'll see you in the new year.


629
00:51:50.218 --> 00:51:52.094
Happy and merry.

630
00:51:55.599 --> 00:51:57.600
I'll call you in the morning.

631
00:52:10.697 --> 00:52:12.281
Coffee?

632
00:52:17.913 --> 00:52:20.789
Guess who has
an early Christmas present?


633
00:52:20.957 --> 00:52:24.627
-Oh, my! How can you live like this?
-Like what?


634
00:52:24.794 --> 00:52:27.129
We'll just wait for you
to tidy up a bit.


635
00:52:27.297 --> 00:52:31.133
In this lifetime? It'll never happen.
Come here, beautiful.


636
00:52:34.804 --> 00:52:37.681
What are you doing here?

637
00:52:38.058 --> 00:52:42.645
-You still like it here?
-I do. I like getting to know the girls.


638
00:52:42.812 --> 00:52:44.897
Most of the time.

639
00:52:45.065 --> 00:52:47.608
-And the weather.
-Yeah, the weather's nice.


640
00:52:47.776 --> 00:52:49.276
-Are you freezing?
-Yeah.


641
00:52:49.444 --> 00:52:52.154
-Your lips are a little blue.
-I like them that way.


642
00:52:52.322 --> 00:52:53.739
Why didn't you bring a coat?

643
00:53:18.974 --> 00:53:20.349
Bill.

644
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.311
Giselle, what are you doing here?

645
00:53:25.522 --> 00:53:27.189
Freezing.

646
00:53:30.568 --> 00:53:34.697
Look, it's over.
I can't see you anymore.


647
00:53:34.864 --> 00:53:37.199
-I can't.
-I know.


648
00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:40.160
Really.

649
00:53:42.872 --> 00:53:45.291
I just want to talk to you
for a minute.


650
00:53:47.669 --> 00:53:49.253
Come on.

651
00:53:58.179 --> 00:53:59.888
Oh, I missed you.

652
00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:03.017
You're beautiful.

653
00:54:03.852 --> 00:54:05.728
Life without you...

654
00:54:05.895 --> 00:54:07.813
...just isn't life.

655
00:54:09.566 --> 00:54:12.860
And I don't wanna go through life
not living. Do you?


656
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.737
No.

657
00:54:14.946 --> 00:54:20.075
I love you so much I would move
to this elitist icebox if you want me to.


658
00:54:25.915 --> 00:54:28.292
Make an honest man out of me.

659
00:54:29.919 --> 00:54:31.754
Miss Watson?

660
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.923
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

661
00:54:35.925 --> 00:54:37.634
Hi.

662
00:54:39.512 --> 00:54:43.474
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar,
this is....


663
00:54:43.641 --> 00:54:45.893
-This is my.... Paul.
-Fiancé.


664
00:54:46.311 --> 00:54:49.313
As of about a minute and a half ago.
Paul Moore.


665
00:54:51.691 --> 00:54:55.819
God. Congratulations!
Your fiancé?


666
00:54:57.697 --> 00:54:59.490
You must be thrilled.

667
00:54:59.657 --> 00:55:02.117
I don't think she's caught
her breath yet.


668
00:55:02.285 --> 00:55:03.452
I haven't.

669
00:55:06.289 --> 00:55:10.834
-Well, sit down. We'll have a toast.
-We'd love to. We're in a hurry.


670
00:55:11.002 --> 00:55:14.129
But that's really great.
Congratulations, old man.


671
00:55:14.297 --> 00:55:17.591
-Congratulations. Merry Christmas.
-Come on, let's....


672
00:55:17.759 --> 00:55:21.303
Best of tidings to you both. Bye.

673
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:51.333
No, Paul.

674
00:55:51.501 --> 00:55:54.253
Nancy'll have a heart attack.
She has these rules.


675
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:56.839
-Come on.
-No.


676
00:55:57.549 --> 00:56:01.260
-Why?
-I said no. I'm not comfortable.


677
00:56:02.512 --> 00:56:05.222
I'll make up the convertible sofa.

678
00:56:12.439 --> 00:56:14.356
What are you doing?

679
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.861
You're not kidding?

680
00:56:19.028 --> 00:56:24.491
I just came 3000 miles to see you.
I'm sleeping down here by myself?


681
00:56:28.329 --> 00:56:30.873
Stop. Stop. Stop for a second.

682
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.710
-Tell me what the hell's going on.
-I don't know.


683
00:56:34.878 --> 00:56:37.296
I feel like everything
is getting away from me.


684
00:56:37.464 --> 00:56:42.551
We haven't actually, literally looked
at each other for three months...


685
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:45.971
...and now you're here,
and I have this ring on my finger.


686
00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:49.057
Which makes you uncomfortable too?

687
00:56:50.018 --> 00:56:54.521
The last time I checked,
we weren't on this track.


688
00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:56.899
When was the last time
you checked?


689
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:19.213
Bill....

690
00:57:20.757 --> 00:57:22.716
The name is Paul.

691
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.434
I'm not saying no to you.

692
00:57:32.602 --> 00:57:34.937
No, you're not saying anything.

693
00:57:36.523 --> 00:57:38.565
You never really do.

694
00:57:58.461 --> 00:58:03.090
If you need me for anything else,
my number's on the refrigerator.


695
00:58:03.258 --> 00:58:05.926
I feel so guilty
leaving you alone after--


696
00:58:06.094 --> 00:58:08.637
I'm fine. I have lots of research
to do.


697
00:58:08.805 --> 00:58:12.391
That's right.
Throw yourself into work.


698
00:58:12.684 --> 00:58:13.850
I'll be back...

699
00:58:14.727 --> 00:58:16.562
...on the 2nd.

700
00:58:17.522 --> 00:58:19.398
See you next year.

701
00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:21.358
1954!

702
00:58:56.686 --> 00:58:59.646
Sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1888.

703
00:58:59.814 --> 00:59:03.275
He painted what he felt,
not what he saw.


704
00:59:03.443 --> 00:59:06.862
People didn't understand. To them,
it seemed childlike and crude.


705
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:10.240
It took years for them to recognize
his actual technique...


706
00:59:10.408 --> 00:59:14.286
...to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move.


707
00:59:14.454 --> 00:59:18.206
Yet, he never sold a painting
in his lifetime.


708
00:59:18.374 --> 00:59:20.375
This is his self-portrait.

709
00:59:20.543 --> 00:59:24.796
There's no camouflage, no romance.
Honesty.


710
00:59:24.964 --> 00:59:30.344
-Now, 60 years later, where is he?
-Famous?


711
00:59:30.511 --> 00:59:34.389
So famous, in fact,
that everybody has a reproduction.


712
00:59:34.557 --> 00:59:37.601
-There are post cards--
-We have the calendar.


713
00:59:37.769 --> 00:59:42.272
With the ability to reproduce art,
it is available to the masses.


714
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.733
No one needs to own
a van Gogh original.


715
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:47.861
We do. In the Newport house.

716
00:59:48.655 --> 00:59:51.740
But it's small. Tiny.

717
00:59:55.244 --> 00:59:58.497
They can paint their own.
Van Gogh in a box, ladies.


718
00:59:58.665 --> 01:00:01.750
The newest form
of mass-distributed art:


719
01:00:01.918 --> 01:00:03.502
Paint by numbers.

720
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:06.713
"Now everyone can be van Gogh.
It's so easy.


721
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:09.132
Just follow the simple instructions...

722
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.260
...and in minutes, you're on
your way to being an artist."


723
01:00:13.304 --> 01:00:15.263
Van Gogh by numbers?

724
01:00:15.431 --> 01:00:19.101
Ironic, isn't it? Look at what
we have done to the man...


725
01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:22.896
...who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste.


726
01:00:23.064 --> 01:00:26.108
Who refused to compromise
his integrity.


727
01:00:26.275 --> 01:00:31.863
We have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him.


728
01:00:32.448 --> 01:00:34.157
So the choice is yours, ladies.

729
01:00:34.325 --> 01:00:38.787
You can conform to what
other people expect or you can--


730
01:00:38.955 --> 01:00:41.915
I know. Be ourselves.

731
01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:44.793
You're a sight for sore eyes.

732
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:49.256
I would've been on time but, silly me,
I thought class was in the classroom.


733
01:00:49.424 --> 01:00:53.218
Glad you could join us, Mrs. Jones.
We thought we'd lost you.


734
01:00:53.469 --> 01:00:56.054
-There's an unwritten rule for Marr--
-Don't bother.


735
01:00:56.222 --> 01:01:00.225
Since your wedding, you've missed
six classes, a paper and your midterm.


736
01:01:00.393 --> 01:01:03.854
Well, thank God I didn't miss
the paint-by-numbers lecture.


737
01:01:04.147 --> 01:01:07.691
I was on my honeymoon
and then I had to set up house.


738
01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:10.902
-What does she expect?
-Attendance.


739
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.531
Most of the faculty turn their heads...

740
01:01:14.699 --> 01:01:17.617
...when the married students
miss a class or two.


741
01:01:17.785 --> 01:01:19.786
Then why not get married
as freshmen?


742
01:01:19.954 --> 01:01:25.041
That way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus.


743
01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:30.630
Don't disregard our traditions
just because you're subversive.


744
01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:34.885
Don't disrespect this class
just because you're married.


745
01:01:35.052 --> 01:01:37.512
Don't disrespect me
just because you're not.


746
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.849
Come to class, do the work,
or I'll fail you.


747
01:01:41.017 --> 01:01:44.144
If you fail me,
there will be consequences.


748
01:01:45.438 --> 01:01:49.149
-Are you threatening me?
-I'm educating you.


749
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:51.443
That's my job.

750
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:37.697
Miss Watson!

751
01:02:40.409 --> 01:02:41.576
What's this?

752
01:02:41.744 --> 01:02:45.747
Every year, the ARs nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest.


753
01:02:45.915 --> 01:02:47.290
The what?

754
01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:51.044
You'll see. Come by tonight at 5:00.

755
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:57.592
Adam's Ribs. A very secret society.

756
01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.094
Wait here.

757
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.064
First, the oath.
Please raise both hands.


758
01:03:12.733 --> 01:03:15.902
Do you swear not to repeat what
you see, hear or smell tonight?


759
01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:17.571
-Smell?
-Keep your hands up!


760
01:03:17.738 --> 01:03:19.823
Yes, smell.

761
01:03:20.116 --> 01:03:21.533
I do.

762
01:03:39.552 --> 01:03:41.887
It'll only burn for a second.

763
01:03:42.054 --> 01:03:43.638
Go on.

764
01:03:53.858 --> 01:03:59.613
And now that you've taken the oath,
we get to ask you whatever we want.


765
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.992
-Oh, is that how it works?
-And you have to answer.


766
01:04:04.535 --> 01:04:05.660
Who invited her?

767
01:04:05.828 --> 01:04:08.038
You're in time
for truth or consequences.


768
01:04:08.205 --> 01:04:11.541
I go first. Why aren't you married?

769
01:04:13.753 --> 01:04:15.295
Well....

770
01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:18.757
That's poisonous.

771
01:04:18.925 --> 01:04:22.677
I'm not married because...

772
01:04:23.095 --> 01:04:24.679
...I'm not.

773
01:04:25.556 --> 01:04:30.018
I was engaged to Patrick Watts.

774
01:04:30.353 --> 01:04:33.939
Everybody called him Leo,
and I never knew why.


775
01:04:34.106 --> 01:04:39.069
He was the first person
that I ever danced with...


776
01:04:39.236 --> 01:04:44.157
...or smoked with,
got incredibly drunk with and--


777
01:04:44.325 --> 01:04:47.702
Well, a lot of first things.

778
01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:53.333
We were 18 and getting married,
Christmas of ‘41.


779
01:04:54.085 --> 01:04:58.046
Then Pearl Harbor happened
and everything changed.


780
01:04:58.214 --> 01:05:02.384
Everybody changed.
And by June, he was sent overseas.


781
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:04.386
-Did he come back?
-Yes.


782
01:05:04.553 --> 01:05:07.222
-Was he changed?
-They both were.


783
01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:12.227
I'm sorry.

784
01:05:12.937 --> 01:05:15.605
-Your parents?
-Yeah.


785
01:05:17.566 --> 01:05:19.484
After the war...

786
01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:24.614
...they didn't know each other
anymore, didn't like each other.


787
01:05:26.575 --> 01:05:29.577
He left. He got a whole new family.

788
01:05:31.372 --> 01:05:32.914
Divorce.

789
01:05:33.082 --> 01:05:34.124
What?

790
01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:38.294
Yeah. First on my block.
That's a city block.


791
01:05:40.715 --> 01:05:44.968
People change. Things happen.
It's the same with me and Leo.


792
01:05:45.386 --> 01:05:48.054
He went off and married
someone else.


793
01:05:48.347 --> 01:05:51.850
-And I got to go to graduate school.
-UCLA, right?


794
01:05:52.018 --> 01:05:55.228
-Which is in Hollywood?
-It's close.


795
01:05:55.396 --> 01:06:00.608
Anyway, aren't you gonna tell
everybody about, you know...


796
01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:03.945
-...your big news?
-What are you talking about?


797
01:06:04.155 --> 01:06:07.532
-She got engaged over Christmas!
-Congratulations!


798
01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.785
I'm sorry to blab.
It's just so romantic.


799
01:06:10.953 --> 01:06:12.704
How fantastic!

800
01:06:13.456 --> 01:06:15.206
We split up.

801
01:06:17.626 --> 01:06:20.920
-What?
-We split up.


802
01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:24.382
Well, that was fast.

803
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.886
Well, not every relationship
is meant for marriage.


804
01:06:28.054 --> 01:06:31.306
-Some are strictly affairs?
-Bill Dunbar.


805
01:06:31.474 --> 01:06:34.684
He'd be an affair. Let's talk
about that, Miss Watson.


806
01:06:34.852 --> 01:06:36.895
You don't believe in withholding,
do you?


807
01:06:37.063 --> 01:06:41.775
No. I do, however, believe in manners.
But for you, I'll make an exception.


808
01:06:41.942 --> 01:06:45.820
That's what we're supposed to do
for married students. Right, Betty?


809
01:06:46.363 --> 01:06:50.617
Professor Dunbar and I
are not having an affair.


810
01:06:50.785 --> 01:06:52.619
Did you have one
with William Holden?


811
01:06:52.787 --> 01:06:54.829
-Connie!
-She asked about Bill Dunbar.


812
01:06:54.997 --> 01:06:57.832
-How did you hear that?
-Oh, it is true!


813
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.292
Betty, I told you.

814
01:07:02.797 --> 01:07:06.007
-Won't you regret never marrying?
-There's still time.


815
01:07:06.175 --> 01:07:08.343
I guess I assume that I will
at some point.


816
01:07:08.511 --> 01:07:11.554
-I'm not gonna plan my life around it.
-Neither should we.


817
01:07:11.722 --> 01:07:13.556
-I didn't say that.
-You did to Joan.


818
01:07:13.724 --> 01:07:16.267
-That's what she told me.
-What are you saying?


819
01:07:16.435 --> 01:07:18.686
She knew you and Tommy
were getting engaged.


820
01:07:18.854 --> 01:07:21.272
And she practically filled out
your application.


821
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.775
-I didn't say that.
-She's been accepted.


822
01:07:23.943 --> 01:07:27.237
Now she just has to figure out
a way to tell Tommy.


823
01:07:28.489 --> 01:07:31.866
Why don't you do it? You're good
at butting into people's business.


824
01:07:32.034 --> 01:07:35.578
Funny, that's what they say
about you.


825
01:07:37.581 --> 01:07:41.668
-Spencer, do I look all right?
-Yeah, fine.


826
01:07:41.836 --> 01:07:44.963
-I don't have a lot of time. Speed it up.
-Mr. Grouchy.


827
01:07:45.422 --> 01:07:49.050
-All right, here we go again.
-All right, go ahead, Louise.


828
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:54.597
Married Wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations.


829
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:56.516
One hears such comments as:

830
01:07:56.684 --> 01:08:01.229
"I baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other."


831
01:08:01.397 --> 01:08:04.607
While our mothers were called
to work for Lady Liberty...


832
01:08:04.775 --> 01:08:09.779
...it is our duty, nay, obligation
to reclaim our place in the home...


833
01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:14.534
...bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future.


834
01:08:14.702 --> 01:08:18.580
One must pause to consider why
Miss Katherine Watson...


835
01:08:18.747 --> 01:08:21.040
...instructor in the Art History
department...


836
01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:25.128
...has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage.


837
01:08:25.296 --> 01:08:28.923
Her subversive and political teachings
encourage our Wellesley girls...


838
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:32.677
...to reject the roles
they were born to fill.


839
01:08:49.653 --> 01:08:51.487
Thank you.

840
01:09:11.634 --> 01:09:13.843
Slide.

841
01:09:16.096 --> 01:09:18.556
-Contemporary art.
-That's just an advertisement.


842
01:09:18.724 --> 01:09:20.350
Quiet!

843
01:09:22.186 --> 01:09:24.854
Today you just listen.

844
01:09:26.732 --> 01:09:30.610
What will the future scholars see
when they study us?


845
01:09:32.404 --> 01:09:36.115
A portrait of women today?

846
01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:40.370
There you are, ladies.

847
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.873
The perfect likeness
of a Wellesley graduate.


848
01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:49.712
Magna cum laude, doing exactly
what she was trained to do.


849
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.172
Slide.

850
01:09:52.841 --> 01:09:54.133
A Rhodes scholar.

851
01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:00.348
I wonder if she recites Chaucer while
she presses her husband's shirts.


852
01:10:00.516 --> 01:10:01.766
Slide.

853
01:10:03.686 --> 01:10:07.689
Now, you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume...


854
01:10:07.856 --> 01:10:10.650
...of every meat loaf you make.
Slide.


855
01:10:11.694 --> 01:10:14.112
A girdle to set you free.

856
01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:23.788
What does that mean?

857
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.208
What does it mean?

858
01:10:31.547 --> 01:10:33.673
I give up.

859
01:10:35.718 --> 01:10:37.719
You win.

860
01:10:38.387 --> 01:10:42.682
The smartest women in the country.

861
01:10:45.311 --> 01:10:50.523
I didn't realize that
by demanding excellence...


862
01:10:50.983 --> 01:10:53.901
...I would be challenging....

863
01:10:56.155 --> 01:11:01.993
What did it say?

864
01:11:04.455 --> 01:11:07.915
"The roles you were born to fill."

865
01:11:08.792 --> 01:11:10.752
Is that right?

866
01:11:14.423 --> 01:11:17.050
The roles you were born to fill?

867
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:26.768
It's my mistake.

868
01:11:39.782 --> 01:11:42.116
Class dismissed.

869
01:11:54.338 --> 01:11:58.841
These girls....
Are you proud, President Carr?


870
01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:03.054
-Yes, actually, I am.
-Well, you should be, I guess.


871
01:12:03.222 --> 01:12:06.641
Half of them are married.
The other half, give it a month or so.


872
01:12:06.809 --> 01:12:08.976
It's really only a matter of time.

873
01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:11.396
They're biding time
until somebody proposes!


874
01:12:11.563 --> 01:12:14.440
A hundred years ago, it was
inconceivable for a woman...


875
01:12:14.608 --> 01:12:16.109
...to be a college graduate.

876
01:12:16.276 --> 01:12:19.112
Perhaps you should look back
to see how far we've come.


877
01:12:19.279 --> 01:12:22.657
I'm sorry, from where I sit,
it's just a different kind of corset.


878
01:12:22.825 --> 01:12:26.869
-Well, we can all use a little support.
-Oh, like Amanda Armstrong?


879
01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:29.372
-She broke the law!
-According to Betty Warren.


880
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.999
According to the state
of Massachusetts.


881
01:12:35.963 --> 01:12:38.172
To hell with Wellesley.
I'm done.


882
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.176
Goddamn it!

883
01:12:44.471 --> 01:12:46.931
It's brilliant, really.
A perfect ruse.


884
01:12:47.099 --> 01:12:49.976
A finishing school disguised
as a college. They got me.


885
01:12:50.144 --> 01:12:52.061
-What do you expect?
-More. More.


886
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:55.898
I thought it was a place for
tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.


887
01:12:56.066 --> 01:12:57.900
-Calm down, please.
-No, I will not!


888
01:12:58.068 --> 01:13:01.362
I've got 10 more minutes.
Meet me in my office. Meet me!


889
01:13:26.597 --> 01:13:31.934
-How you feeling?
-Stupid. Deceived.


890
01:13:32.186 --> 01:13:35.146
Really, really angry.

891
01:13:36.565 --> 01:13:42.069
Change takes time, you know?
You gotta let them catch up with you.


892
01:13:43.071 --> 01:13:45.698
Katherine, this place needs you.

893
01:13:46.241 --> 01:13:50.786
I don't know how the hell they let
you in, but I'm sure glad they did.


894
01:13:53.874 --> 01:13:58.711
The things I said to President Carr.
She'll never let me back in.


895
01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:00.630
She's a pretty good egg.

896
01:14:01.924 --> 01:14:04.133
What things?

897
01:14:04.301 --> 01:14:06.385
Don't worry.

898
01:14:06.803 --> 01:14:08.638
Time will heal it.

899
01:14:08.805 --> 01:14:12.808
Unless, of course, you want to go back
to California and that fiancé of yours.


900
01:14:14.269 --> 01:14:17.355
We're not engaged. Thanks.

901
01:14:17.523 --> 01:14:20.733
Sorry I interrupted your class.

902
01:14:30.953 --> 01:14:32.578
Katherine!

903
01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:41.295
I wanted to give you this.
It was for Christmas, and....


904
01:14:41.547 --> 01:14:44.423
Then I met your man, so I....

905
01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:03.276
The Sistine Chapel.

906
01:15:03.944 --> 01:15:05.736
David.

907
01:15:06.321 --> 01:15:09.407
Venus de Milo. And...

908
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.909
...Mona Lisa.

909
01:15:14.663 --> 01:15:16.664
Thank you.

910
01:15:24.548 --> 01:15:27.800
This is gonna be
a three-in-one shot. Ready?


911
01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:32.763
You didn't even try.

912
01:15:34.349 --> 01:15:37.643
This game is probably a no-no
in the Better Homes and Gardens.


913
01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:41.981
Not that I have ever been in the
better homes and gardens. Have you?


914
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:44.317
No. No, I'm just an old soldier.

915
01:15:44.484 --> 01:15:48.237
They don't invite us.

916
01:15:48.405 --> 01:15:50.531
What do they say about them though?

917
01:15:50.699 --> 01:15:53.409
-Old soldiers never die. We just--
-They just...


918
01:15:53.577 --> 01:15:57.038
...become philandering
Italian professors.


919
01:15:57.205 --> 01:15:59.373
-That was below the belt.
-That was unkind.


920
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:00.958
Deeply unkind.

921
01:16:15.599 --> 01:16:19.060
You know, I don't know how I feel
about being a rebound.


922
01:16:19.227 --> 01:16:23.439
-I'll leave.
-No, you don't have to do that.


923
01:16:23.607 --> 01:16:25.900
I'll get used to it.

924
01:16:26.109 --> 01:16:29.403
-What are you doing?
-Getting dressed.


925
01:16:29.571 --> 01:16:33.532
I had fun, and I'm not looking
for anything serious.


926
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.410
Why don't you come down here
and we can discuss it?


927
01:16:36.578 --> 01:16:40.831
But as long as we're doing
whatever it is that we're doing--


928
01:16:40.999 --> 01:16:43.834
Which we did pretty well,
don't you think?


929
01:16:47.089 --> 01:16:48.714
No students.

930
01:16:50.509 --> 01:16:52.927
I'm serious.

931
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:58.683
I don't want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume.


932
01:17:00.519 --> 01:17:03.604
-Katherine, I--
-I need your word.


933
01:17:07.275 --> 01:17:08.776
All right, you have my word.

934
01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:13.823
-Okay.
-Now can we change the subject?


935
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:17.702
Talk about something
a little more interesting?


936
01:17:17.869 --> 01:17:20.996
Like breakfast.

937
01:17:21.456 --> 01:17:23.791
You know, I make
a mean blueberry pancake.


938
01:17:23.959 --> 01:17:25.876
I just put that shoe on.

939
01:17:26.044 --> 01:17:28.671
I don't think I know you
well enough for breakfast.


940
01:17:28.839 --> 01:17:30.548
I don't know about that.

941
01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:36.303
So how does a guy
get to know you better?


942
01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:40.474
Well, let me--
That's a good idea.


943
01:17:48.275 --> 01:17:50.735
Is that a battle wound you have?

944
01:17:54.573 --> 01:17:58.701
I'm a sucker for war stories
in Romance languages.


945
01:17:58.869 --> 01:18:01.203
-Well, that's pretty easy.
-Yeah?


946
01:18:02.998 --> 01:18:09.003
I was in a village... called San Remo...

947
01:18:11.089 --> 01:18:15.009
...the Krauts pounded us hard...

948
01:18:15.177 --> 01:18:16.719
...me & Stan...

949
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:21.682
...you remember Stan? We were the
only two left from our platoon.


950
01:18:21.975 --> 01:18:29.315
We heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed.


951
01:18:30.108 --> 01:18:31.692
When night fell...

952
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.694
A trap it was?

953
01:18:37.032 --> 01:18:38.532
Remember...

954
01:18:39.326 --> 01:18:41.869
...invert your nouns and
your verbs.


955
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:08.187
-Hungry?
-Famished.


956
01:19:08.355 --> 01:19:11.440
Don't say we can live on love.
That's how I missed breakfast.


957
01:19:15.695 --> 01:19:17.530
What's the matter?

958
01:19:18.865 --> 01:19:22.284
-What's the matter?
-Phillip and Vanessa McIntyre.


959
01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:25.079
-Parents of a friend.
-You wanna say a quick hello?


960
01:19:25.247 --> 01:19:28.249
No! No, I'll be trapped.

961
01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:30.167
Damn it!

962
01:19:33.296 --> 01:19:35.965
-Could you seat us in the bar?
-We're only serving...


963
01:19:36.132 --> 01:19:39.218
...in the front part of the restaurant
this afternoon.


964
01:19:43.056 --> 01:19:45.724
Miss! Miss Stone.

965
01:19:45.892 --> 01:19:50.563
This has been the most romantic
weekend I may ever have.


966
01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:54.859
Ever. And all that's standing
between right now and perfection...


967
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:57.361
...are the McIntyres over there.

968
01:19:57.529 --> 01:20:02.783
Now, with the competition out there,
a girl's got to be able to move...


969
01:20:02.951 --> 01:20:05.703
...a few mountains
every once in a while.


970
01:20:05.871 --> 01:20:09.623
-I could use all the help I could get.
-Come this way.


971
01:20:14.337 --> 01:20:18.507
-I fixed it. No more McIntyres.
-Thank you. Thank you.


972
01:20:20.802 --> 01:20:24.388
-Let's not talk about this.
-All right.


973
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.226
Hold your breath and--

974
01:20:31.521 --> 01:20:33.564
And turn.

975
01:20:34.107 --> 01:20:37.443
Don't forget to smile.

976
01:20:38.486 --> 01:20:40.321
Arms up.

977
01:20:40.488 --> 01:20:43.157
Move together. Faster, Fran!

978
01:20:44.326 --> 01:20:47.745
-When you surface, smile.
-Come on, Connie!


979
01:20:50.373 --> 01:20:53.876
How about we have a girls' luncheon
this weekend? Just us.


980
01:20:54.711 --> 01:20:57.171
-Where's Spencer?
-Away.


981
01:20:57.339 --> 01:20:59.506
-I'm free.
-I'm busy.


982
01:20:59.674 --> 01:21:02.217
-What are you doing?
-She's dating a psychoanalyst.


983
01:21:02.385 --> 01:21:04.178
-Oh, really?
-Who's married.


984
01:21:04.346 --> 01:21:06.931
-Giselle!
-Sorry, it slipped.


985
01:21:07.098 --> 01:21:09.475
-Are you in, Connie?
-I'll check with Charlie.


986
01:21:09.643 --> 01:21:12.561
-Who?
-Charlie Stewart. Your cousin.


987
01:21:12.729 --> 01:21:14.813
You're kidding?

988
01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:19.860
We spent last weekend at the Cape.

989
01:21:20.028 --> 01:21:23.697
-A little hideaway he knew about.
-Operative word, "hide."


990
01:21:23.865 --> 01:21:27.201
Men take women to the Cape in
the winter when they're embarrassed.


991
01:21:27.369 --> 01:21:30.537
-He's using you.
-He's not using you if you wanna go.


992
01:21:30.705 --> 01:21:32.414
Come here. Don't listen to her.

993
01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:36.043
I love you, and I swear
I'm not saying this to hurt you.


994
01:21:36.211 --> 01:21:40.255
Charlie's promised to Deb McIntyre.
She wears his pin.


995
01:21:41.049 --> 01:21:44.802
-Giselle, you know it's true.
-I don't know anything about a pin.


996
01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.971
McIntyre?

997
01:21:47.389 --> 01:21:50.265
Are her parents named
Phillip and Vanessa?


998
01:21:50.892 --> 01:21:52.726
You know them?

999
01:21:54.396 --> 01:21:56.188
Only from a distance.

1000
01:22:09.035 --> 01:22:12.830
-Good morning. Good morning.
-Goodbye. Good morning.


1001
01:22:12.998 --> 01:22:15.499
Okay, wait. No, we have an audience.
Don't look.


1002
01:22:18.086 --> 01:22:20.254
No, I don't--
No. Stop it. Put me down.


1003
01:22:20.422 --> 01:22:22.756
Put me down.
You're not coming in this house.


1004
01:22:22.924 --> 01:22:26.260
You are not coming
in this house. No.


1005
01:22:26.428 --> 01:22:28.220
-Bye. Good morning.
-Good morning.


1006
01:22:28.388 --> 01:22:30.347
Go away. Go away.

1007
01:22:37.439 --> 01:22:42.359
How can you date a man like that?

1008
01:22:43.486 --> 01:22:46.363
What if you're wrong about him?

1009
01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:48.699
What if I'm not?

1010
01:22:53.872 --> 01:22:56.331
Coffee's cold.

1011
01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.021
Row!

1012
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:20.606
Ride the plank!

1013
01:23:20.774 --> 01:23:22.983
Row!

1014
01:23:45.006 --> 01:23:47.382
Are your ears burning?

1015
01:23:48.093 --> 01:23:51.178
I think the feet go first
when they set the stake on fire.


1016
01:23:51.346 --> 01:23:54.098
"What do you say, Edward?
Should we have her back?"


1017
01:23:54.265 --> 01:23:56.517
"She's got rather nice legs."

1018
01:23:56.684 --> 01:23:58.769
-Who's to say I wanna come back?
-What...


1019
01:23:58.937 --> 01:24:01.730
...leave me here with all these girls?

1020
01:24:11.783 --> 01:24:14.076
You'd think someone
would notice empty trays.


1021
01:24:14.244 --> 01:24:17.621
You are good. You remind me
of myself when I was your age.


1022
01:24:32.554 --> 01:24:34.471
Cheers.

1023
01:24:34.722 --> 01:24:38.559
He's positively vomititious, Giselle.

1024
01:24:38.893 --> 01:24:41.520
Don't be so sentimental, Connie.

1025
01:24:42.689 --> 01:24:45.983
It was a fling. It's fine.
It was nothing.


1026
01:24:54.951 --> 01:24:56.910
Hi!

1027
01:24:58.079 --> 01:25:00.038
Pleasure to meet you.

1028
01:25:05.753 --> 01:25:08.255
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.


1029
01:25:09.174 --> 01:25:12.426
Connie! Connie!
Excuse me. Sorry. Connie!


1030
01:25:12.594 --> 01:25:15.470
Charlie. It's been a while.

1031
01:25:15.638 --> 01:25:18.515
Yeah. How are you?

1032
01:25:18.766 --> 01:25:21.435
I'm fine, thank you. You? Deb?

1033
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:25.939
-Pardon?
-Deb. Your girlfriend.


1034
01:25:26.107 --> 01:25:27.941
With the very large--

1035
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:32.321
With the very large teeth.

1036
01:25:32.488 --> 01:25:36.450
-Oh, did you think I didn't know?
-Connie.


1037
01:25:36.618 --> 01:25:40.621
Deb and I broke it off last summer.
That's Miranda.


1038
01:25:40.788 --> 01:25:46.418
We started seeing each other when
you stopped returning my calls...


1039
01:25:46.586 --> 01:25:49.546
...or answering any of my letters.

1040
01:25:55.261 --> 01:25:56.762
Okay, maybe I should go.

1041
01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:18.700
Have you seen Spencer?

1042
01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:28.293
But I did see Charlie Stewart.

1043
01:26:29.837 --> 01:26:33.632
And he told me that he and Deb
broke up last summer.


1044
01:26:34.342 --> 01:26:38.637
And you told me they were together
when he invited me to the Cape.


1045
01:26:38.805 --> 01:26:41.848
Oh, Connie.
I don't keep track of his dates.


1046
01:26:42.016 --> 01:26:46.520
They've been on-again, off-again
for the past few years.


1047
01:26:46.688 --> 01:26:50.857
No, apparently they've been
off-again for a while. For quite a while.


1048
01:26:51.025 --> 01:26:53.986
-So?
-So you made me believe...


1049
01:26:54.153 --> 01:26:56.780
...that he was hiding me.

1050
01:26:58.950 --> 01:27:01.285
Either way...

1051
01:27:01.452 --> 01:27:04.288
...why couldn't you let me be happy?

1052
01:27:10.545 --> 01:27:12.462
Betty.

1053
01:27:35.945 --> 01:27:38.238
And we switch.

1054
01:27:40.158 --> 01:27:42.951
-Wonder teacher.
-Tommy.


1055
01:27:45.288 --> 01:27:48.832
-How's Harvard?
-Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.


1056
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.501
-Congratulate me.
-You set a date?


1057
01:27:54.047 --> 01:27:56.089
No, nothing official. Yet.

1058
01:27:56.257 --> 01:27:59.259
I meant, I got into Penn. Grad school.

1059
01:27:59.719 --> 01:28:02.679
Congratulations. 
What about Yale?

1060
01:28:03.264 --> 01:28:08.560
Yale? Oh, you mean Joanie.
Yeah. How about that, huh?


1061
01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:11.355
She is some girl.

1062
01:28:11.522 --> 01:28:14.107
-She's terrific.
-Yeah.


1063
01:28:14.275 --> 01:28:19.488
Just the fact that she got in.
I mean, she will always have that.


1064
01:28:19.655 --> 01:28:23.617
Thanks to you. Miss Watson,
you've been real swell to her.


1065
01:28:23.785 --> 01:28:26.370
We both appreciate it.

1066
01:28:27.789 --> 01:28:31.083
I'm sorry. "The fact that she got in,"
what does that mean?


1067
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:34.544
Well, she'll be in Philadelphia.

1068
01:28:34.712 --> 01:28:36.171
With me.

1069
01:28:39.467 --> 01:28:43.553
Well, that's an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5:00.


1070
01:28:44.138 --> 01:28:47.933
-And we switch.
-Thank you.


1071
01:28:53.981 --> 01:28:55.816
Excuse me.

1072
01:28:56.067 --> 01:28:59.444
Excuse me. Have you seen Spencer?
I can't find him anywhere.


1073
01:29:03.157 --> 01:29:06.993
Actually, Spencer asked me
to take you home.


1074
01:29:07.161 --> 01:29:11.289
-He has this meeting--
-In New York.


1075
01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:13.542
Thank you.

1076
01:29:42.196 --> 01:29:45.657
-Honey, what are you doing here?
-I'm staying the night.


1077
01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:49.619
-Spencer won't mind?
-Spencer won't notice.


1078
01:29:49.787 --> 01:29:55.417
-He's in New York again. Working.
-He's working hard for both of you.


1079
01:29:55.585 --> 01:29:59.421
Don't lie for him, Mother.
He does it so well for himself.


1080
01:29:59.589 --> 01:30:02.090
You're going to turn around,
go home...


1081
01:30:02.258 --> 01:30:04.551
...fix your face
and wait for your husband.


1082
01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:07.929
This is the bargain you made,
Elizabeth. We all did.


1083
01:30:08.097 --> 01:30:10.557
So you're not gonna let me
stay in my own house?


1084
01:30:10.725 --> 01:30:12.893
Spencer's house is your house now.

1085
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:17.022
Believe me, it's for your own good.

1086
01:30:34.081 --> 01:30:36.875
Miss Watson. Come in.

1087
01:30:37.293 --> 01:30:40.086
Seven law schools within 45 minutes
of Philadelphia.


1088
01:30:40.254 --> 01:30:42.964
You can study and get dinner
on the table by 5:00.


1089
01:30:43.132 --> 01:30:45.967
-It's too late.
-No. Some accept late admissions.


1090
01:30:46.135 --> 01:30:48.303
-I was upset at first.
-Joan, the guests.


1091
01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:51.431
When Tommy told me that he got
accepted to Penn, I thought:


1092
01:30:51.599 --> 01:30:54.434
"Her fate is sealed.
How can she throw it all away?"


1093
01:30:54.602 --> 01:30:58.396
I realized you won't have to. You
could bake your cake and eat it too.


1094
01:30:58.564 --> 01:31:00.774
We're married.

1095
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:03.944
We eloped over the weekend.

1096
01:31:04.111 --> 01:31:06.863
Turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony...


1097
01:31:07.031 --> 01:31:10.116
...so we did a sort of
spur-of-the-moment thing.


1098
01:31:10.284 --> 01:31:12.244
Very romantic.

1099
01:31:12.411 --> 01:31:14.162
Look.

1100
01:31:22.588 --> 01:31:24.714
It's beautiful.

1101
01:31:27.718 --> 01:31:32.514
It was my choice. Not to go.
He would have supported it.


1102
01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:36.726
-But you don't have to choose.
-No, I have to.


1103
01:31:36.894 --> 01:31:39.854
I want a home, a family.
It's not something I'll sacrifice.


1104
01:31:40.022 --> 01:31:43.191
No one's asking you
to sacrifice that, Joan.


1105
01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:46.111
I just want you to understand
that you can do both.


1106
01:31:46.279 --> 01:31:49.155
Think I'll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer?


1107
01:31:49.323 --> 01:31:50.865
Yes, I'm afraid that you will.

1108
01:31:51.033 --> 01:31:55.495
Not as much as I'd regret not having
a family. Not being there to raise them.


1109
01:31:55.663 --> 01:32:00.041
I know exactly what I'm doing, and
it doesn't make me any less smart.


1110
01:32:00.918 --> 01:32:03.962
-This must seem terrible to you.
-I didn't say that. I--


1111
01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:07.173
Sure you did. You always do.

1112
01:32:07.341 --> 01:32:11.011
You stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image, but you don't.


1113
01:32:11.178 --> 01:32:15.098
To you, a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial.


1114
01:32:15.266 --> 01:32:19.060
She has no depth,
no intellect, no interests.


1115
01:32:21.856 --> 01:32:25.650
You're the one who said
I could do anything I wanted.


1116
01:32:25.818 --> 01:32:28.194
This is what I want.

1117
01:32:32.742 --> 01:32:34.909
Congratulations.

1118
01:32:35.077 --> 01:32:37.120
Be happy.

1119
01:32:58.184 --> 01:33:02.270
Sometimes I think you say
these things to provoke me.


1120
01:33:02.438 --> 01:33:05.398
Does your father know
that you speak this way?


1121
01:33:09.904 --> 01:33:12.739
Does your wife know you're here?

1122
01:33:50.444 --> 01:33:54.114
-Where might I find Charlie Stewart?
-Charlie Stewart? C1744.


1123
01:33:54.281 --> 01:33:57.534
-But it's too late. You'll have to leave.
-All right.


1124
01:34:02.164 --> 01:34:04.332
You can't go up there!

1125
01:34:07.586 --> 01:34:09.462
What is going on here?

1126
01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:11.965
There's no women allowed
in the dorms!


1127
01:34:13.801 --> 01:34:16.970
Can you please not interrupt me?!

1128
01:34:18.514 --> 01:34:23.643
Connie! What are you doing here?

1129
01:34:25.563 --> 01:34:26.938
Well, I saw....

1130
01:34:27.106 --> 01:34:29.190
I saw Big Teeth with...

1131
01:34:29.358 --> 01:34:32.986
...Kevin Tawil looking pretty cozy,
and I thought that maybe....


1132
01:34:33.154 --> 01:34:35.739
Maybe you two weren't....

1133
01:34:36.657 --> 01:34:40.368
-Dating?
-Yes. Thank you.


1134
01:34:40.661 --> 01:34:42.829
Hey, no girls in the dorm.

1135
01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:50.044
I know I have made mistakes.
A ton.


1136
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:53.465
But I never make them twice.

1137
01:35:12.777 --> 01:35:14.319
And?

1138
01:35:14.862 --> 01:35:20.492
And it was perfect. Romantic.
We stayed up all night talking.


1139
01:35:20.659 --> 01:35:22.994
You're late. What happened
to Sunday brunch?


1140
01:35:23.162 --> 01:35:26.372
We stayed up all night too.
Not talking.


1141
01:35:26.999 --> 01:35:30.335
The psychoanalyst? Again.

1142
01:35:32.213 --> 01:35:35.298
-Divine exhaustion.
-He's married.


1143
01:35:35.466 --> 01:35:37.258
He's not married like
you and Tommy.


1144
01:35:37.426 --> 01:35:38.885
What does that mean?

1145
01:35:39.053 --> 01:35:42.180
It means he and his wife
don't speak the same language.


1146
01:35:42.348 --> 01:35:45.099
-Spelled S-E-X.
-Does he pay you?


1147
01:35:45.267 --> 01:35:46.810
For sex?

1148
01:35:47.144 --> 01:35:49.687
At the rate you're going,
you could make a fortune.


1149
01:35:50.231 --> 01:35:53.608
-Betty.
-Everyone thinks so.


1150
01:35:53.776 --> 01:35:57.487
Do you know what they say?
They say you're a whore.


1151
01:35:57.988 --> 01:36:02.033
Once they've all sampled you,
they'll toss you aside like a used rag.


1152
01:36:02.201 --> 01:36:05.036
-Betty, stop now.
-The men you love don't want you.


1153
01:36:05.204 --> 01:36:08.581
-Your father doesn't want you.
-I'm gonna meet you downstairs.


1154
01:36:08.749 --> 01:36:10.750
-Professor Dunbar.
-Betty, that's enough.


1155
01:36:10.918 --> 01:36:13.670
Everybody knows that you hide
outside his house.


1156
01:36:13.879 --> 01:36:17.549
It must be torturous running after
a man who doesn't care about you...


1157
01:36:17.967 --> 01:36:21.261
...who's in love with someone else,
who hates you.


1158
01:36:21.428 --> 01:36:23.763
-He hates you!
-Betty.


1159
01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:25.890
And it hurts! No!

1160
01:36:26.058 --> 01:36:29.060
-Get off me!
-Quiet!


1161
01:36:38.112 --> 01:36:40.113
Oh, God.

1162
01:36:41.949 --> 01:36:45.243
-He doesn't want me.
-Okay.


1163
01:36:45.452 --> 01:36:48.538
He doesn't sleep with me. He--

1164
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:50.373
I know.

1165
01:37:02.803 --> 01:37:06.973
I say no. I mean,
it's not fair to her.

1166
01:37:07.141 --> 01:37:10.810
-She's not happy.
-Don't forget about her outburst.


1167
01:37:10.978 --> 01:37:13.104
Oh, that's right.

1168
01:37:13.355 --> 01:37:16.983
Dr. Staunton, will you tell the
alumnae the figures you have?


1169
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:20.111
Enrollment for her class next year...

1170
01:37:20.279 --> 01:37:24.782
...is the highest
the department's had. Ever.


1171
01:37:25.784 --> 01:37:28.453
She'd have to promise
to turn in her lesson plans.


1172
01:37:28.829 --> 01:37:32.749
In advance. And they'll need
to be approved.


1173
01:37:32.917 --> 01:37:34.918
She'll never agree to that.

1174
01:37:44.136 --> 01:37:47.263
Bill, the brochures
for Europe arrived.


1175
01:37:51.769 --> 01:37:53.686
Surprise!

1176
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:56.689
Sir, I'm so sorry!

1177
01:37:56.857 --> 01:37:59.359
-Who are you?
-I'm Stanley Sher...


1178
01:37:59.526 --> 01:38:02.153
...a friend of Bill's.
We were in the 37th together.


1179
01:38:02.321 --> 01:38:05.073
-Okay.
-You must be Katherine.


1180
01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.241
I am.

1181
01:38:07.409 --> 01:38:10.954
He told me you were a looker, but....

1182
01:38:12.915 --> 01:38:16.876
-I'll wait for you downstairs, Stanley.
-Okey-dokey.


1183
01:38:20.798 --> 01:38:23.049
So you and Bill
were in the war together?


1184
01:38:23.217 --> 01:38:26.761
Yep. Now he's some
fancy teacher...


1185
01:38:26.929 --> 01:38:29.305
...and I'm in air conditioning.

1186
01:38:29.473 --> 01:38:30.974
Forget the A-bomb.

1187
01:38:31.892 --> 01:38:34.811
Freon. It's gonna change
the good old U.S. of A.


1188
01:38:35.187 --> 01:38:39.190
Open the entire West to development.
I'm based in El Paso.


1189
01:38:39.608 --> 01:38:42.485
-Oh, thank you.
-And cheers.


1190
01:38:45.364 --> 01:38:47.824
Well, you've come a long way
from San Remo.


1191
01:38:47.992 --> 01:38:49.909
Yes, sirree.

1192
01:38:50.536 --> 01:38:52.704
That in California?

1193
01:38:53.414 --> 01:38:54.914
Italy.

1194
01:38:55.082 --> 01:38:58.501
-Where you two were stationed.
-Italy?


1195
01:38:58.669 --> 01:39:01.129
Well, somebody's been
pulling your long leg.


1196
01:39:01.296 --> 01:39:05.550
We were stationed at the Army
Language Institute on Long Island.


1197
01:39:05.718 --> 01:39:09.637
Closest we ever got to Italy
was the baked ziti at Mama Leone's.


1198
01:39:09.805 --> 01:39:12.765
I don't think Bill's
ever been to Europe.


1199
01:39:12.933 --> 01:39:15.101
I sure as hell haven't.

1200
01:39:15.477 --> 01:39:16.769
Cheers.

1201
01:39:26.947 --> 01:39:28.865
Katherine!

1202
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:34.620
You okay?

1203
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:37.623
I met Stan.

1204
01:39:38.584 --> 01:39:39.834
Hell of a nice guy.

1205
01:39:40.002 --> 01:39:41.794
-Yeah.
-What a talker.


1206
01:39:41.962 --> 01:39:43.880
Yeah.

1207
01:39:44.048 --> 01:39:47.133
We go back a long way.

1208
01:39:47.301 --> 01:39:49.802
All the way to Long Island.

1209
01:39:53.766 --> 01:39:55.975
Secret's out.

1210
01:39:57.478 --> 01:40:00.229
What an incredible lie.

1211
01:40:03.317 --> 01:40:06.903
I spoke the language, I had the
uniform, people just assumed things.


1212
01:40:07.071 --> 01:40:11.574
I didn't correct them.
I guess I should've done.


1213
01:40:12.826 --> 01:40:15.203
I guess you should've done.

1214
01:40:16.955 --> 01:40:19.832
Katherine, look, 
I'm sorry, okay?

1215
01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:22.502
I made a mistake.

1216
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:24.587
Just give me a chance...

1217
01:40:24.755 --> 01:40:27.298
...to straighten things out, okay?

1218
01:40:30.552 --> 01:40:33.346
Why couldn't you just be honest?

1219
01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:38.226
You don't make it easy.

1220
01:40:40.395 --> 01:40:42.271
You're so perfect, you....

1221
01:40:44.358 --> 01:40:47.401
It's impossible to be honest
with you. I....


1222
01:40:48.529 --> 01:40:50.613
For you, it is.

1223
01:40:53.784 --> 01:40:57.870
Well, it's not just me, Katherine.
Joan failed you too, right?


1224
01:40:58.038 --> 01:41:01.415
-That's an awful thing to say.
-I know, but it's the truth.


1225
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:05.545
If you want honesty,
I can be real honest.


1226
01:41:05.712 --> 01:41:08.714
You didn't come to Wellesley
to help people find their way.


1227
01:41:08.882 --> 01:41:12.426
I think you came to help people
find your way.


1228
01:41:37.077 --> 01:41:40.496
I'm not accustomed
to hunting you down.


1229
01:41:42.457 --> 01:41:45.042
Elizabeth, look at me, please.

1230
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:52.633
I've spoken with Mrs. Jones.
There will be no divorce.


1231
01:41:53.927 --> 01:41:57.096
There's always a period
of adjustment.


1232
01:41:57.264 --> 01:42:01.100
I've assured her that you will try
for a year.


1233
01:42:03.687 --> 01:42:05.980
Look at this, Mother.

1234
01:42:10.819 --> 01:42:13.029
Spencer will try as well.

1235
01:42:13.197 --> 01:42:17.408
According to her, he's really
very upset. You should call him.


1236
01:42:17.576 --> 01:42:21.537
She's smiling. Is she happy?

1237
01:42:22.956 --> 01:42:26.792
The important thing
is not to tell anyone.


1238
01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.669
She looks happy.

1239
01:42:29.213 --> 01:42:31.547
So, what does it matter?

1240
01:42:32.216 --> 01:42:36.552
Don't wash your dirty laundry
in public.


1241
01:42:36.845 --> 01:42:39.472
Let me tell you something.

1242
01:42:40.766 --> 01:42:44.227
Not everything is as it seems.

1243
01:43:03.455 --> 01:43:05.998
Dear Miss Watson:

1244
01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:08.334
It is with great pleasure...

1245
01:43:08.502 --> 01:43:10.670
...that we invite you...

1246
01:43:10.837 --> 01:43:14.340
...to return as an instructor...

1247
01:43:14.508 --> 01:43:16.842
...in the Art History department...

1248
01:43:17.010 --> 01:43:22.640
...for the 1954-1955
academic year.


1249
01:43:22.808 --> 01:43:27.687
We do wish to make clear, however,
that this invitation...


1250
01:43:27.854 --> 01:43:33.317
...is absolutely conditional
upon the following:


1251
01:43:34.861 --> 01:43:37.029
Please, Nora, may we continue?

1252
01:43:37.197 --> 01:43:39.323
Number one:

1253
01:43:39.825 --> 01:43:45.037
You will teach only the syllabus
as outlined by the department chair.


1254
01:43:45.998 --> 01:43:47.707
Number two:

1255
01:43:47.874 --> 01:43:49.750
All lesson plans...

1256
01:43:49.918 --> 01:43:55.214
...must be submitted at the beginning
of every term for approval...


1257
01:43:55.382 --> 01:43:57.508
...and revision.

1258
01:43:57.676 --> 01:43:59.051
Number three:

1259
01:43:59.219 --> 01:44:03.306
You shall not provide counsel
beyond your own subject...


1260
01:44:03.473 --> 01:44:06.517
...for any student at any time.

1261
01:44:06.685 --> 01:44:08.311
And finally:

1262
01:44:08.478 --> 01:44:13.816
That you will agree to maintain
a strictly professional relationship...


1263
01:44:13.984 --> 01:44:16.569
...with all members of the faculty.

1264
01:44:16.737 --> 01:44:19.238
-Good evening, Katherine.
-Hi, Violet.


1265
01:44:19.614 --> 01:44:23.784
Assuming you accept the conditions,
we look forward to your continuing...


1266
01:44:23.952 --> 01:44:26.203
...to be a part
of our Wellesley tradition.


1267
01:44:34.963 --> 01:44:37.381
Nice party.

1268
01:44:37.549 --> 01:44:39.258
I didn't realize.

1269
01:44:40.344 --> 01:44:42.178
It was a surprise.

1270
01:44:42.387 --> 01:44:45.139
William H. Taft.
What does the letter H stand for?


1271
01:44:45.307 --> 01:44:47.767
-Howard.
-Howard. Yes!


1272
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.394
Howard.

1273
01:44:51.313 --> 01:44:53.314
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1274
01:44:53.482 --> 01:44:57.360
The important thing is
that you'll be back next year.


1275
01:44:57.527 --> 01:44:59.945
Hopefully living here.

1276
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:07.370
Well, I haven't really thought about
that. They just told me today.


1277
01:45:09.289 --> 01:45:11.582
Well, there's still plenty of time.

1278
01:45:11.958 --> 01:45:14.960
You should be celebrating.

1279
01:45:20.884 --> 01:45:22.635
You're right.

1280
01:45:24.721 --> 01:45:26.764
You're right. Let's celebrate.

1281
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.854
Let's go upstairs and get gussied up
and go out dancing.


1282
01:45:36.191 --> 01:45:40.861
Silly, it's after 8:00.
Strike It Rich is on.


1283
01:45:41.029 --> 01:45:45.032
-Life isn't about Strike It Rich.
-It's a school night.


1284
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:49.537
-So what?
-So I don't want to go. I'm happy here.


1285
01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:52.373
It's back on.

1286
01:45:55.836 --> 01:45:59.547
-Do you feel good about music....
-Oh, isn't he handsome?


1287
01:46:01.133 --> 01:46:03.050
Watch with me.

1288
01:46:04.803 --> 01:46:10.057
"You talked me into it," says this
oldie. What's the title of this one?


1289
01:46:13.353 --> 01:46:15.438
"You Made Me Love You."

1290
01:46:15.605 --> 01:46:19.316
"You Made Me Love--"
"You Made Me Love You."


1291
01:46:23.363 --> 01:46:26.031
You get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas...


1292
01:46:26.199 --> 01:46:28.909
...and it's her facial expression...

1293
01:46:29.077 --> 01:46:31.203
...her eyes that makes
you think that.


1294
01:46:31.371 --> 01:46:35.166
-I think that makes it interesting.
-The context that it comes from...


1295
01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:36.876
...affects the way we view it.

1296
01:46:37.043 --> 01:46:40.129
I think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter...


1297
01:46:40.297 --> 01:46:43.674
...and in turn, he's kind of sending
that message to us.


1298
01:46:43.842 --> 01:46:47.386
Whether or not it's a good painting
cannot be subjective.


1299
01:46:47.554 --> 01:46:50.347
I feel like I'm missing something.

1300
01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.444
It was Joan's idea.

1301
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:52.034
How else will you remember us?

1302
01:48:35.287 --> 01:48:38.330
-They've invited you back.
-Do you think they made a mistake?


1303
01:48:38.498 --> 01:48:39.957
I do.

1304
01:48:44.713 --> 01:48:48.966
-Elizabeth, I don't see Spencer.
-Excuse me, Mother.


1305
01:48:49.134 --> 01:48:52.511
Miss Watson, can you help me
get in touch with your friend...


1306
01:48:52.679 --> 01:48:53.971
...in Greenwich Village?

1307
01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:56.557
What do you need
in Greenwich Village?


1308
01:48:56.725 --> 01:48:58.142
An apartment.

1309
01:48:59.644 --> 01:49:02.605
I filed for a divorce this morning.

1310
01:49:03.857 --> 01:49:06.942
And since we know
I'm not welcome at your house....


1311
01:49:08.653 --> 01:49:12.823
You remember Giselle Levy?
What did you call her?


1312
01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.201
"A New York kike." That's it.

1313
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:19.663
Well, we're going to be roommates.

1314
01:49:20.749 --> 01:49:22.541
Hi.

1315
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:26.211
-You ready?
-Yeah.


1316
01:49:38.767 --> 01:49:40.559
You okay?

1317
01:49:42.604 --> 01:49:45.522
-Greenwich Village?
-Yeah. For a while.


1318
01:49:46.316 --> 01:49:48.567
Then, who knows?

1319
01:49:48.735 --> 01:49:52.029
Maybe law school. Yale, even.

1320
01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.075
Well...

1321
01:49:56.743 --> 01:50:01.288
...I wouldn't want to come up against
you in any court anywhere.


1322
01:50:01.456 --> 01:50:04.166
Maybe I can drop by next year?

1323
01:50:04.334 --> 01:50:06.627
Keep you on your toes.

1324
01:50:08.755 --> 01:50:10.839
You will be here?

1325
01:50:11.591 --> 01:50:13.592
Miss Watson?

1326
01:50:19.683 --> 01:50:21.600
Dear Betty:

1327
01:50:21.768 --> 01:50:26.605
I came to Wellesley because
I wanted to make a difference.


1328
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:28.899
But to change for others....

1329
01:50:29.067 --> 01:50:31.235
--is to lie to yourself.

1330
01:50:31.403 --> 01:50:32.695
My teacher...

1331
01:50:32.862 --> 01:50:36.240
...Katherine Watson,
lived by her own definition...


1332
01:50:36.408 --> 01:50:38.659
...and would not compromise that.

1333
01:50:38.827 --> 01:50:41.537
Not even for Wellesley.

1334
01:50:42.163 --> 01:50:44.998
I dedicate this, my last editorial...

1335
01:50:45.166 --> 01:50:47.126
...to an extraordinary woman...

1336
01:50:47.293 --> 01:50:49.211
...who lived by example...

1337
01:50:49.379 --> 01:50:53.424
...and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes.


1338
01:50:54.634 --> 01:50:58.512
By the time you read this,
she'll be sailing to Europe...


1339
01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.598
...where I know she'll find new walls
to break down...


1340
01:51:01.766 --> 01:51:03.726
...and new ideas
to replace them with.


1341
01:51:03.893 --> 01:51:05.978
Hold it, everybody.

1342
01:51:11.818 --> 01:51:14.153
I've heard her called a quitter
for leaving...


1343
01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.780
...an aimless wanderer.

1344
01:51:16.948 --> 01:51:21.160
But not all who wander are aimless.

1345
01:51:21.327 --> 01:51:25.831
Especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition...


1346
01:51:27.834 --> 01:51:30.043
...beyond definition...

1347
01:51:32.756 --> 01:51:34.840
...beyond the image.

1348
01:51:35.258 --> 01:51:37.760
Get the hell out of the way!

1349
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:49.480
I'll never forget you.

1350
01:51:54.736 --> 01:51:58.989
Betty! Betty!

1351
01:52:28.686 --> 01:52:30.312
What about after this war, Lee?

1352
01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.232
Well, this job belongs
to some soldier.


1353
01:52:33.399 --> 01:52:34.691
When he comes back...

1354
01:52:34.859 --> 01:52:37.277
-...he can have it.
-Oh, that's swell.
