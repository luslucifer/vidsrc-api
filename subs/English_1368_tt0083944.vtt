00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.550
Excuse me, can you tell me
this, where Delmare Berry lives?


2
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.902
He ain't here.

3
00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:30.423
Go on inside, baby.

4
00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:37.410
He's a friend of mine...

5
00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:43.005
Well in fact, he wrote his
address down...right here.


6
00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.818
Here.

7
00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.421
You can see that's Delmare's writing.

8
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:50.567
I sure had a hard
time finding this place!


9
00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:54.212
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.


10
00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.878
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in Nam.


11
00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.336
I don't know if he
ever talked about me...


12
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:06.293
I've got a picture of us together.

13
00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:08.625
Somewhere...

14
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.251
This junk in my pocket!

15
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.042
Here...here it is.

16
00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.376
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,


17
00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.729
and there's Delmare, right in the back.

18
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.583
We had to put him in the
back because he's so big,


19
00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.853
if we didn't, he'd take
up the whole picture!


20
00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.353
Delmare's gone.

21
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.266
- What time will he be back?
- He died.


22
00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:33.620
What?

23
00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:36.560
Died last summer.

24
00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:39.851
Died how?

25
00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.871
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.

26
00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:47.390
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.


27
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.452
Cut him down to nothing. I
couldn't lift him off the sheet.


28
00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:04.680
I'm very sorry.

29
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.963
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?

30
00:05:02.964 --> 00:05:05.025
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?


31
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.629
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!


32
00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:24.771
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!


33
00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.814
Gonna take a bath this week?!

34
00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:35.937
Morning!

35
00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:43.894
You...you visiting someone around here?

36
00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:46.476
No.

37
00:05:48.437 --> 00:05:52.310
You know, wearing that flag on that
jacket, looking the way you do...


38
00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:55.392
you're askin' for
trouble around here, friend!


39
00:05:57.101 --> 00:06:00.642
- Headed North or South?
- North.


40
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.767
Jump in, I'll make sure you
head in the right direction, huh!


41
00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.347
- Where you heading?
- Portland.


42
00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:23.431
Portland is South, you said
you were headed North.


43
00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:26.762
You got some place I
can eat around here?


44
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.576
There's a diner about

45
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.844
Is there a law against me
getting something to eat here?


46
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:38.114
Yeah, me.

47
00:06:40.344 --> 00:06:41.886
Why are you pushin' me?

48
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.009
What did you say?

49
00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.384
l said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.


50
00:06:48.634 --> 00:06:51.925
First of all, you don't ask the
questions around here, I do. Understand?


51
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:57.633
Secondly...we don't want
guys like you in this town.


52
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:01.048
Drifters.

53
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.547
First thing you know
we got a whole bunch


54
00:07:02.548 --> 00:07:05.049
of guys like you in
this town. That's why!


55
00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.587
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...

56
00:07:10.673 --> 00:07:12.338
It's a quiet little town.

57
00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.380
In fact, you might say it's boring!

58
00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:18.068
But that's the way we like it.

59
00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.942
And I get paid
to keep it that way.

60
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.421
Boring...

61
00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:41.877
Portland, straight ahead!

62
00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.314
If you want some friendly advice...

63
00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:51.521
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!


64
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:53.833
Hope this ride helped you out!

65
00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:02.063
Have a nice day, huh!

66
00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:42.473
Where the hell do
you think you're going?


67
00:08:44.054 --> 00:08:45.553
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!

68
00:08:51.055 --> 00:08:52.075
Let's see some I.D.!

69
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.469
All right, you're under arrest!

70
00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:57.886
You hear me? You put
your hands on the car.


71
00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:00.927
Now you put your hands on
the car, and you spread'em.


72
00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:05.281
Are you gonna put
your hands on that car?


73
00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:07.968
How you do it, you
decide, right now!


74
00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.257
Put your legs back.

75
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.318
Back!

76
00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:30.798
You try to be nice to some people!

77
00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:37.046
Well, what do we have here, huh?

78
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.672
What would you be
carrying a knife like this?


79
00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:44.568
Hunting.

80
00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:48.713
Don't be a wise guy! What
do you hunt with a knife?


81
00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:51.545
Name it.

82
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.128
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.


83
00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:01.438
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?

84
00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:04.292
Hey, talk about your
sorry looking humanity!


85
00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:06.480
Just another smartass drifter.

86
00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:13.375
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?


87
00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:15.831
I want you to book
this gentleman for


88
00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:19.916
vagrancy, resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.


89
00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:21.852
He says he uses it for hunting.

90
00:10:22.896 --> 00:10:25.165
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

91
00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:29.164
See if you can clean him up a
little. He smells like an animal!


92
00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:36.747
Hey, Mitch...Mitch!

93
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.163
Yo!

94
00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:39.244
Escort this young man downstairs.

95
00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:40.515
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:41.663 --> 00:10:43.350
Right this way, partner.

97
00:10:43.664 --> 00:10:44.497
Right here.

98
00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:46.375
That's it.

99
00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:54.660
OK, here we go.

100
00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:00.043
You know, it looks
like it'll take old Leroy


101
00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:02.074
about 10 years to paint this hall!

102
00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.470
Why don't you paint it your damned self?

103
00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:06.388
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

104
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:08.159
Mr. Ward!

105
00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:11.699
Would you take this for me, please?

106
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:21.114
Name?

107
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:27.446
Your name?

108
00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:31.203
Your name!

109
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:37.256
Name!

110
00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:42.422
Hey...you're lookin' to trouble?

111
00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:44.986
You came at the right place, buddy!

112
00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:46.609
Oh, wait a second.

113
00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:50.985
You got three seconds
before I break your face in!


114
00:11:51.862 --> 00:11:53.257
He means it.

115
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.193
Yeah, I do.

116
00:12:14.023 --> 00:12:17.772
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!


117
00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.771
Rambo...

118
00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:22.477
John J.?

119
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.000
You're gonna talk to me.

120
00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:30.501
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.


121
00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:34.937
I'm starting to dislike you.

122
00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:37.809
A lot.

123
00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:41.852
I'm gonna run a make on him.

124
00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:46.225
Put his name in the Teletype.

125
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.684
Just roll it across.

126
00:12:50.143 --> 00:12:51.599
Roll it across!

127
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:54.431
Push it.

128
00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:57.078
It won't work that way, it'll
only smear. Roll it across!


129
00:12:58.308 --> 00:13:00.036
Look, you son of a
bitch, if you don't put your


130
00:13:00.037 --> 00:13:02.389
goddamned hand down
there, I'm gonna break it off!


131
00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:06.848
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?


132
00:13:07.347 --> 00:13:09.014
Nothing I can't handle.

133
00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:11.763
He won't let us print him well.

134
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:14.345
Leave the ink on your hand!

135
00:13:16.513 --> 00:13:18.240
Just what is your problem, huh?

136
00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:21.595
Listen, hardass! As
things stand right now,


137
00:13:21.596 --> 00:13:24.179
you're facing the ass end
of a 90 day incarceration!


138
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:28.491
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you
don't look to me like you can pay!


139
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:31.406
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.


140
00:13:32.241 --> 00:13:33.510
And you think we're tough!

141
00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:36.386
We're gonna make you
look more presentable


142
00:13:36.387 --> 00:13:38.032
for your courtroom appearance.

143
00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.634
Between now and then, you can
just impress the hell outta me


144
00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:43.987
by doing exactly as you're told.

145
00:13:50.132 --> 00:13:51.405
Clean him up.

146
00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:54.529
All right, Preston,
I want you to go


147
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.215
over there and get that
hose ready, alright?


148
00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:04.445
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?


149
00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:06.297
Who gives a shit?

150
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.693
All right, put your hands on
top of your head and turn around.


151
00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:18.483
Oh, Christ! We should report this
to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!


152
00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.837
You just do what I tell you.

153
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.442
Gault, what the fuck was that?

154
00:14:28.356 --> 00:14:30.460
Well, the Man said "clean him up".

155
00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:35.273
Clean him up!

156
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.937
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!


157
00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:57.144
How'd you like that, huh?

158
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:01.143
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?


159
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:14.391
All right, hurry it up, it's time for
my coffee break. Alright, sit down!


160
00:15:14.892 --> 00:15:16.599
Sit down!

161
00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:27.034
Damn it, that boy's
hard to get a hold of!


162
00:15:28.513 --> 00:15:30.660
That's OK, Ward, don't worry
about the soap, he's tough.


163
00:15:30.974 --> 00:15:32.910
Just shave him. Dry!

164
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.745
All right...

165
00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:38.450
How blind are you? Can't
you see this guy's crazy?


166
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:41.075
Can't you see I don't give a shit?

167
00:15:41.784 --> 00:15:43.910
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.


168
00:15:44.617 --> 00:15:46.739
See there, I knew that you...

169
00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:50.678
We're just going to shave
you partner, take it easy!


170
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.033
Take this, Mitch.

171
00:15:57.907 --> 00:15:59.219
Don't move...

172
00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:01.365
I don't want you
to cut your own throat!

173
00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:18.006
You son of a bitch! Come on!

174
00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:38.378
What the hell is...

175
00:16:42.553 --> 00:16:43.595
Art! Art!

176
00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:01.339
Hey, you can't...

177
00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:30.908
I'm gonna kill this asshole!

178
00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:32.159
Art, don't shoot!

179
00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:35.058
Don't shoot, there's people down there!

180
00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:37.247
All right, get help! 
I'll go after him!

181
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:42.159
Get outta the way!

182
00:19:22.392 --> 00:19:23.748
Son of a bitch!

183
00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:34.247
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.


184
00:19:34.747 --> 00:19:37.081
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.


185
00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:58.066
I know you can hear me!

186
00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:01.517
You're finished!

187
00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:06.052
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!

188
00:21:08.772 --> 00:21:10.231
D'you hear me?

189
00:22:16.132 --> 00:22:16.862
Mitch!

190
00:22:17.488 --> 00:22:18.321
Lester!

191
00:22:19.888 --> 00:22:21.638
He's up there behind the draw.

192
00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.512
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

193
00:22:25.452 --> 00:22:28.118
Tell him to get out here with
his damned dogs right away.


194
00:22:28.617 --> 00:22:30.178
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!

195
00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:32.573
lt's gonna rain, we'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.


196
00:22:33.448 --> 00:22:35.448
Lester, tell Paul to get
out to the lumber camp


197
00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:36.928
to get the helicopter up here.

198
00:22:37.948 --> 00:22:39.050
If they give him
any shit, tell him to

199
00:22:39.051 --> 00:22:41.822
site him for obstruction
right on the spot.


200
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.472
We'll get him!

201
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.367
No problem.

202
00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:22.983
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

203
00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:25.940
Come on, sweethearts!

204
00:23:26.774 --> 00:23:28.107
Let's go get him, babies!

205
00:23:30.274 --> 00:23:33.233
Won't be long before he's
stuffed and mounted, huh Will?


206
00:23:34.172 --> 00:23:35.149
Make him into a bear rug!

207
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:36.918
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?

208
00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:38.813
Yeah, I got a
couple of bucks last year!

209
00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:41.812
Hey Mitch, up the hill!

210
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.894
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!


211
00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:09.185
Keep moving, my dogs can
eat and run at the same time!


212
00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:11.244
He's going straight to the top.

213
00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:14.079
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?

214
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.349
He's just dumb!

215
00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:35.596
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!


216
00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:41.241
- This is no good.
- Why?


217
00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:44.326
There were three of us in
the cell block down there!


218
00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:46.491
He went through us like
we weren't even there!


219
00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:49.198
Oh, come on!

220
00:26:01.584 --> 00:26:04.062
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!

221
00:26:04.168 --> 00:26:06.646
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's
heading for Chapman's gorge.


222
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:08.750
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!

223
00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.911
There he is! On the cliff!

224
00:27:03.408 --> 00:27:04.824
Son of a bitch!

225
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.451
What the hell's going on?

226
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.904
What are you doing? We're
just supposed to spot him!


227
00:27:17.404 --> 00:27:21.281
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!


228
00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:24.781
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

229
00:27:25.281 --> 00:27:30.881
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!


230
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:34.654
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

231
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:41.463
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

232
00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.151
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

233
00:27:45.276 --> 00:27:47.420
Get closer and hold it steady!

234
00:27:47.526 --> 00:27:49.880
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I
want to know what's going on!


235
00:27:54.103 --> 00:27:56.187
I got him...easy now.

236
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:42.683
There he is!

237
00:28:42.684 --> 00:28:45.351
Over there, dummy! Come on!

238
00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:51.702
Hey, soldier boy!

239
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.700
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this
radio! What's going on up there?


240
00:29:18.312 --> 00:29:20.919
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?


241
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.963
Art, come in!

242
00:30:21.748 --> 00:30:24.146
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!


243
00:30:25.334 --> 00:30:26.376
Christ, look!

244
00:30:30.023 --> 00:30:33.063
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!

245
00:30:34.606 --> 00:30:37.063
Oh no, no, no! Shit!

246
00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:26.134
I can't figure it...
How did he fall out?

247
00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:28.428
Does it matter?

248
00:31:28.682 --> 00:31:31.347
Let's nail this sucker's
ass...He can't be far!


249
00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.658
Will!

250
00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:37.282
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!

251
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:45.594
There's one man dead. lt's not my
fault. I don't want any more hurt.


252
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.699
Freeze!

253
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.947
Stay right where you
are and give yourself up!


254
00:31:50.407 --> 00:31:52.320
But I didn't do anything!

255
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:55.551
I'm warning you, boy, don't make
a move, I'll blow your head off!


256
00:31:55.592 --> 00:31:57.091
I didn't do anything!

257
00:32:02.863 --> 00:32:05.155
Cease fire! Cease fire!

258
00:32:06.028 --> 00:32:08.319
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

259
00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:13.069
I think we hit him. Let
us get down there. Move!


260
00:32:15.652 --> 00:32:17.321
Sheriff to base, come in.

261
00:32:21.445 --> 00:32:22.070
Go ahead, Will.

262
00:32:22.527 --> 00:32:24.141
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

263
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.256
Galt's dead, alright? Where the
hell is that goddamned chopper?


264
00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:31.795
He won't come, Will. Says
there's a storm heading your way.


265
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:34.292
I don't give a goddamned
what's on its way.


266
00:32:34.293 --> 00:32:36.065
I want that chopper back here right now!

267
00:32:36.645 --> 00:32:38.940
I don't want Gault's
body out here all night.


268
00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:42.774
Listen, Will. You sure picked one
hell of a guy to mess around with!


269
00:32:42.853 --> 00:32:44.365
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.


270
00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:45.877
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

271
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:50.481
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!


272
00:32:50.648 --> 00:32:52.355
Jesus, that freak?!

273
00:32:52.356 --> 00:32:54.688
I knew there was
something about that guy!


274
00:32:55.456 --> 00:32:58.585
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?


275
00:33:03.244 --> 00:33:05.539
I want you to do what I
told you to do, goddamn it!


276
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.041
Get that chopper back here now! Out.

277
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.375
Green Beret!

278
00:33:13.688 --> 00:33:15.982
War hero!

279
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.787
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!


280
00:33:19.993 --> 00:33:21.036
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?


281
00:33:21.037 --> 00:33:23.434
He's one man...wounded!

282
00:33:24.928 --> 00:33:28.056
Those Green Berets...they're
real bad asses.


283
00:33:28.517 --> 00:33:30.393
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?


284
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.556
Look. Look at him...look at
him! That's Art Gault, boy!


285
00:33:42.098 --> 00:33:44.473
He and I were friends when your

286
00:33:44.474 --> 00:33:46.848
momma was still wiping your nose!

287
00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:50.905
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!


288
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.312
Now you listen boy,
you listen to me good:


289
00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:53.881
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch...

290
00:33:54.403 --> 00:33:57.322
and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!


291
00:33:58.715 --> 00:33:59.757
And I'm gonna do it,

292
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:02.888
with you, or without you!

293
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:23.377
We're closin' in, the
scent's getting stronger.


294
00:34:24.003 --> 00:34:25.461
All right, keep your eyes open!

295
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.564
It's gonna storm...it's all we need now!

296
00:34:32.565 --> 00:34:35.171
Will, c'mon, let's get out of
here before it gets too dark.


297
00:34:35.292 --> 00:34:37.066
What's the matter, you
afraid of the boogie man?


298
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.420
You goddamned pansy!

299
00:34:40.939 --> 00:34:43.024
Put your gun down, I'll
show you who the pansy is!


300
00:34:44.913 --> 00:34:47.520
Knock it off! Ward! 
Ward, move out!

301
00:34:47.521 --> 00:34:50.126
The fight is out here! He's
out there waiting for you.


302
00:34:50.832 --> 00:34:52.919
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

303
00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:58.003
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!


304
00:34:58.582 --> 00:35:00.668
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.


305
00:35:09.497 --> 00:35:10.540
There he is!

306
00:35:12.542 --> 00:35:14.185
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

307
00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:17.001
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!


308
00:35:25.913 --> 00:35:27.996
Cease fire!

309
00:35:33.538 --> 00:35:35.102
Goddammit, I'm hit!

310
00:35:37.662 --> 00:35:40.369
Jesus, he's got a gun..

311
00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:52.077
It's not him, it's a
goddamned scarecrow!


312
00:35:53.031 --> 00:35:55.012
No scarecrow that
shot Orville, he's close.


313
00:35:57.572 --> 00:35:58.616
Kill him! Go get him!

314
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.868
Go get him, Maggie!

315
00:36:14.658 --> 00:36:18.533
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.


316
00:36:19.193 --> 00:36:21.279
Look at his leg!

317
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.948
Mitch, get your belt. Make
a tourniquet around that.


318
00:36:23.443 --> 00:36:24.956
We got to get
this guy to a doctor!

319
00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:27.406
Goddamnit, get your belt on that
fast! Where's the first-aid kit?


320
00:36:27.502 --> 00:36:28.441
I left it in the car.

321
00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:29.485
Shit!

322
00:36:29.693 --> 00:36:32.299
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.


323
00:36:32.444 --> 00:36:34.412
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?


324
00:36:34.727 --> 00:36:37.320
Because whatever killed Orval's
dog was no bullet, that's how!


325
00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:40.132
Hurry up! Orval, listen
to me, now listen!


326
00:36:40.654 --> 00:36:42.007
You have to stay awake, all right?

327
00:36:42.289 --> 00:36:44.427
You have to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.


328
00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:47.398
We'll be right back! We go
get him now, he's outta ammo.


329
00:36:48.395 --> 00:36:51.522
Get him! He had no right to shoot
my babies. Get the son of a bitch!


330
00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:53.003
- Let's go!
- Go get him!


331
00:36:55.148 --> 00:36:57.690
All right, now listen up!

332
00:36:58.316 --> 00:36:59.410
We're right on top of him.

333
00:36:59.411 --> 00:37:01.444
We're gonna form a
skirmish line, 50 feet apart.


334
00:37:01.626 --> 00:37:03.920
Keep moving, there's no way
outta here, except through us.


335
00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:09.974
OK, let's do some huntin'...

336
00:37:10.604 --> 00:37:13.628
Huntin'? We ain't
huntin' him, he's huntin' us!


337
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:31.603
Spread out. Spread out,
dammit! I said 50 feet!


338
00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:57.999
I hate this!

339
00:39:12.068 --> 00:39:13.112
Will, it's Mitch!

340
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.608
Who is it?

341
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:52.935
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!


342
00:39:56.473 --> 00:39:59.079
He's got Ward. Spread
out, I'll go this way.


343
00:40:09.093 --> 00:40:10.135
Will! Over here!

344
00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:15.725
Who's firing?

345
00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:18.471
Who's firing?

346
00:40:18.681 --> 00:40:19.825
I got him!

347
00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:21.948
Shingleton, follow me!

348
00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:28.928
Will, help me!

349
00:40:30.182 --> 00:40:31.224
Help me, Will!

350
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.994
Balford? Where the hell are you?!

351
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:52.116
Shingleton, over here!

352
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:10.843
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!

353
00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:38.399
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.


354
00:41:39.604 --> 00:41:41.794
In town you're the law,
out here, it's me!


355
00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:47.542
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll
give you a war you won't believe!


356
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.814
Let it go.

357
00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.020
Let it go.

358
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.932
Move back, you guys, move back!

359
00:42:59.552 --> 00:43:02.054
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...


360
00:43:03.008 --> 00:43:04.573
That's the only good thing about this,

361
00:43:04.574 --> 00:43:06.136
is the business you're doing in town!

362
00:43:06.968 --> 00:43:09.054
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

363
00:43:11.502 --> 00:43:13.639
You look like you're
ready to keel over, Will.


364
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.715
Why don't you go
home? It's my problem now.


365
00:43:16.814 --> 00:43:19.317
Your problem? Listen Dave,
don't give me any of your


366
00:43:19.318 --> 00:43:22.132
horsehit about jurisdiction
in this one, you understand?


367
00:43:22.837 --> 00:43:25.444
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.


368
00:43:26.982 --> 00:43:30.424
Somewhere in this rugged mountain
countryside, possibly above the snow line,


369
00:43:31.568 --> 00:43:34.697
shrouded in mist, the
fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.


370
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:36.090
Units of the state
police along with local


371
00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:40.152
members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.


372
00:43:40.768 --> 00:43:43.218
What still remains
unexplained by local authorities


373
00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:45.148
is just how and where
the former Green Beret


374
00:43:45.605 --> 00:43:46.855
came into possession of the weapons

375
00:43:46.856 --> 00:43:49.777
with which he allegedly
killed one deputy sheriff,


376
00:43:50.184 --> 00:43:51.540
and tried to kill 6 others.

377
00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:53.731
Only their skilled training
in police enforcement


378
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:55.609
techniques saved their lives.

379
00:43:55.687 --> 00:43:57.616
And word now is that
the fugitive will be


380
00:43:57.617 --> 00:43:59.754
in custody in a matter of hours.

381
00:44:01.833 --> 00:44:03.038
Maps, Will.

382
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.899
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.


383
00:44:08.003 --> 00:44:09.358
I'll talk to you later, OK?

384
00:44:09.828 --> 00:44:12.019
What is it, Lester? What is it
for Christ sake, spit it out!


385
00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:18.437
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that


386
00:44:18.438 --> 00:44:22.333
Gault and a couple of deputies
were...a little hard on the guy.


387
00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:23.959
Assholes!

388
00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:28.454
It doesn't make one goddammed bit
of difference, Dave, and you know it!


389
00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:34.505
If one of my deputies...gets
outta line with a prisoner,


390
00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:35.913
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!


391
00:44:36.622 --> 00:44:38.917
And if I find out it's like he
says, I kick the deputy's ass!


392
00:44:38.994 --> 00:44:41.392
Me, the law! That's
the way it's gotta be.


393
00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:46.703
People start fuckin' around with
the law, and all hell breaks loose.


394
00:44:50.073 --> 00:44:51.846
Whatever possessed God in
heaven to make a man like Rambo?


395
00:44:52.576 --> 00:44:53.931
God didn't make Rambo.

396
00:44:55.452 --> 00:44:56.495
I made him.

397
00:44:57.035 --> 00:44:58.078
Who the hell are you?

398
00:44:58.677 --> 00:45:01.492
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

399
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:05.053
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?


400
00:45:05.086 --> 00:45:06.963
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?


401
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:11.552
I recruited him, I trained him, I
commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.


402
00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:13.796
I'd say that makes him mine.

403
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.404
I wonder why the Pentagon would

404
00:45:16.405 --> 00:45:19.427
send a full bird Colonel to handle this?

405
00:45:20.305 --> 00:45:22.390
The army thought I
might be able to help.


406
00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:24.260
I don't know in what way.

407
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:26.033
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.

408
00:45:27.586 --> 00:45:31.653
I don't think you understand. I didn't
come here to rescue Rambo from you.


409
00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.966
I came here to rescue you from him.

410
00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:37.692
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.


411
00:45:38.422 --> 00:45:39.986
We'll try to be extra careful!

412
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.608
I'm just amazed he allowed
any of your posse to live.


413
00:45:44.445 --> 00:45:45.382
Is that right?

414
00:45:45.773 --> 00:45:49.214
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!


415
00:45:49.215 --> 00:45:50.257
That's just great!

416
00:45:51.927 --> 00:45:52.675
Colonel, you came out here

417
00:45:52.676 --> 00:45:55.404
to find out why one of
your machines blew a gasket!


418
00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:58.037
You don't seem to want to
accept the fact that you're


419
00:45:58.038 --> 00:46:00.652
dealing with an expert
in guerilla warfare.


420
00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:02.692
With a man who's the best.

421
00:46:03.111 --> 00:46:05.421
With guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.


422
00:46:06.088 --> 00:46:09.963
A man who's been trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather.


423
00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:12.816
To live off the land...

424
00:46:12.817 --> 00:46:15.212
To eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.


425
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:20.502
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel, to kill...period!


426
00:46:21.419 --> 00:46:25.461
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!


427
00:47:21.618 --> 00:47:23.993
OK, Colonel, now you've
got us all scared to death.


428
00:47:23.994 --> 00:47:26.367
What do you and the Special Forces think

429
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.732
I oughta do about your psycho out there?

430
00:47:30.609 --> 00:47:31.619
Let him go.

431
00:47:31.702 --> 00:47:33.386
- Do what?
- For now.


432
00:47:34.783 --> 00:47:36.782
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.

433
00:47:37.616 --> 00:47:39.928
Provide a little gap and
let him slip through it.


434
00:47:40.427 --> 00:47:43.303
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks,


435
00:47:43.304 --> 00:47:46.073
you'll pick him up in Seattle or
someplace, working in a car wash.


436
00:47:46.115 --> 00:47:47.573
There'll be no fight and
nobody else will get hurt.


437
00:47:47.613 --> 00:47:50.196
I do my own work. I don't
figure the best way to do that is


438
00:47:50.197 --> 00:47:52.885
to close my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle!


439
00:47:53.697 --> 00:47:55.802
If you send your people in
there after him, they'll get killed!


440
00:47:55.884 --> 00:47:58.508
You know, we're just a small
hick town Sheriff's department,


441
00:47:58.509 --> 00:48:00.609
Colonel, but we're
expected to do our duty


442
00:48:00.647 --> 00:48:02.733
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.


443
00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:06.194
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.


444
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.177
No shit, I never thought of that!

445
00:48:08.217 --> 00:48:09.276
You want a war you can't win?

446
00:48:09.382 --> 00:48:13.568
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against
your boy is a no win situation for us?


447
00:48:13.876 --> 00:48:15.597
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.


448
00:48:15.702 --> 00:48:16.586
What?

449
00:48:16.899 --> 00:48:18.568
A good supply of body-bags!

450
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:23.295
Trautman!

451
00:48:26.128 --> 00:48:27.940
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman...


452
00:48:28.566 --> 00:48:31.004
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.


453
00:48:31.398 --> 00:48:35.501
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...


454
00:48:56.833 --> 00:49:00.041
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.


455
00:49:06.435 --> 00:49:11.413
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!


456
00:49:13.268 --> 00:49:17.057
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded.


457
00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:19.870
Every possible exit has been blocked,

458
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:22.433
every highway, every
road, every fire break.


459
00:49:22.656 --> 00:49:24.376
You have our word that
your services to your


460
00:49:24.377 --> 00:49:26.097
country will be taken
into consideration.


461
00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:27.845
And you'll receive fair treatment.

462
00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:31.243
Just respond, we can
work everything out...over.


463
00:49:32.078 --> 00:49:32.867
Anything?

464
00:49:33.493 --> 00:49:37.118
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.


465
00:49:37.759 --> 00:49:39.114
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up


466
00:49:39.115 --> 00:49:41.512
some information. Maybe
catch some cross talk.


467
00:49:42.034 --> 00:49:42.869
Of course, he's listening.

468
00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.573
He's not gonna break radio silence.

469
00:49:44.574 --> 00:49:47.700
No, not for us, but he
might do it for you, Colonel.


470
00:49:48.366 --> 00:49:49.906
He's your boy, isn't he?

471
00:49:52.784 --> 00:49:56.446
Maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.


472
00:49:57.363 --> 00:49:58.425
I can try.

473
00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:01.406
At least, we'd get a
radio fix on his position,


474
00:50:01.407 --> 00:50:02.844
if you don't mind
setting him up for us...


475
00:50:02.885 --> 00:50:04.310
Setting him up for you?

476
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.883
It's like bringing the
pigeons to the cat!


477
00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:14.446
Thanks for bringing your people out.

478
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:15.403
Any time, Will.

479
00:50:15.487 --> 00:50:17.632
C'mon, Bobby, put the
magazine away, will ya?


480
00:50:17.633 --> 00:50:20.298
Pay attention. I mean we
may only get one crack at this.


481
00:50:25.443 --> 00:50:28.463
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.


482
00:50:31.296 --> 00:50:32.814
Company leader calling Raven.

483
00:50:37.335 --> 00:50:40.458
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.


484
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.999
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

485
00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:50.437
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

486
00:50:50.581 --> 00:50:55.186
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

487
00:50:55.894 --> 00:50:56.746
Confirm.

488
00:50:57.665 --> 00:50:58.912
This is Colonel Trautman.

489
00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:02.474
Talk to me, Johnny.

490
00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:19.266
They're all gone, Sir.

491
00:51:19.766 --> 00:51:23.536
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.


492
00:51:23.576 --> 00:51:25.368
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.

493
00:51:26.701 --> 00:51:29.451
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

494
00:51:29.951 --> 00:51:31.534
Berry's gone too, Sir.

495
00:51:32.973 --> 00:51:33.908
How?

496
00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:36.324
Got himself killed in Nam...

497
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:39.805
Didn't even know it. Cancer
ate him down to the bone.


498
00:51:41.116 --> 00:51:42.949
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

499
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.844
I'm the last one, Sir.

500
00:51:46.698 --> 00:51:49.738
lt's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!


501
00:51:51.698 --> 00:51:54.260
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,


502
00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:55.257
but they don't want any more trouble.

503
00:51:55.363 --> 00:51:56.718
He's north-west!

504
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.842
That's why I've come.

505
00:52:00.094 --> 00:52:01.758
I'm gonna come in
and fly you the hell out.


506
00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:05.737
Just you and me. We'll work this
out together. Is that fair enough?


507
00:52:06.738 --> 00:52:08.007
Where'd you come from, Sir?

508
00:52:08.424 --> 00:52:09.487
Bragg.

509
00:52:11.237 --> 00:52:12.401
I tried to get in touch with you,

510
00:52:12.402 --> 00:52:14.610
but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you.


511
00:52:14.694 --> 00:52:16.984
Well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately,


512
00:52:16.985 --> 00:52:20.110
they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.


513
00:52:20.735 --> 00:52:22.568
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

514
00:52:25.568 --> 00:52:27.421
We'll talk about that when you come in.

515
00:52:27.422 --> 00:52:29.066
I can't do that, Sir.

516
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.452
Well, look, John, we can't have
you running around out there,


517
00:52:34.557 --> 00:52:35.920
wasting friendly civilians.

518
00:52:36.565 --> 00:52:39.523
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.


519
00:52:40.607 --> 00:52:42.930
I was there with you, knee
deep in blood and guts.


520
00:52:43.973 --> 00:52:45.773
I covered your ass more than once!

521
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.115
Seems like bailing you out of trouble

522
00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:51.771
is becoming a lifetime job for me!

523
00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:54.626
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king shit cop!


524
00:52:55.709 --> 00:52:57.062
All I wanted was something to eat.

525
00:52:58.604 --> 00:53:00.333
But the man kept pushin', Sir.

526
00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:03.209
Well, you did some
pushin' on your own, John!


527
00:53:04.271 --> 00:53:05.830
They drew first blood, not me.

528
00:53:05.913 --> 00:53:06.851
Look Johnny...

529
00:53:08.104 --> 00:53:09.996
Let me come in, and get
you the hell outta there.


530
00:53:12.143 --> 00:53:14.184
They drew first blood...

531
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:24.746
Rambo! Are you still reading me?

532
00:53:29.557 --> 00:53:31.224
Company leader to Raven!

533
00:53:32.556 --> 00:53:33.828
Rambo, acknowledge!

534
00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.889
He's all finished, Colonel!

535
00:53:38.058 --> 00:53:39.910
We've got a real
good fix on him now.

536
00:53:40.328 --> 00:53:42.805
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got upon that ridge.


537
00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.284
Then we'll get him my way!

538
00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:52.762
Goddammit.

539
00:53:54.428 --> 00:53:55.303
Goddammit!

540
00:54:05.594 --> 00:54:07.345
Come on, move it!

541
00:54:09.222 --> 00:54:10.057
Let's go!

542
00:54:12.092 --> 00:54:13.800
Does this guy got a gun?

543
00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:26.007
There's the guy the
cops are shootin' at!


544
00:55:26.008 --> 00:55:29.019
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!


545
00:55:29.518 --> 00:55:30.726
Don't shoot!

546
00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:33.079
This way! Let's go!

547
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.434
There he is! Come on!

548
00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:00.534
Now we got him!

549
00:56:04.493 --> 00:56:07.264
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.


550
00:56:07.786 --> 00:56:09.929
Surround the area with every
man you've got, but don't move in.


551
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.286
I repeat: don't move in!

552
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:14.242
Don't do anything till I get
there! And no shooting!


553
00:56:14.452 --> 00:56:16.012
I don't want him dead, 
I want him alive!

554
00:56:33.966 --> 00:56:35.715
Keep firing!

555
00:56:37.758 --> 00:56:39.674
Come on guys, shoot!

556
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:42.799
Come on!

557
00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:46.339
You guys are great!

558
00:56:47.464 --> 00:56:48.609
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!


559
00:56:49.131 --> 00:56:50.380
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,


560
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:51.526
go to the front of that mine.

561
00:56:51.567 --> 00:56:53.537
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!


562
00:56:53.538 --> 00:56:54.463
No way!

563
00:56:59.274 --> 00:57:00.439
- Brandon?
- What?


564
00:57:01.378 --> 00:57:04.089
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!


565
00:57:04.128 --> 00:57:05.066
What do you mean, not me?!

566
00:57:05.484 --> 00:57:07.774
Look, I do this part time, I
didn't come here to get killed.


567
00:57:07.984 --> 00:57:10.691
He's probably just waitin' for us!

568
00:57:10.732 --> 00:57:12.127
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

569
00:57:16.732 --> 00:57:20.669
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.


570
00:57:21.459 --> 00:57:23.125
National Guard leader.

571
00:57:24.626 --> 00:57:29.040
And I'm giving you just

572
00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:33.082
Who's got the rocket launcher?

573
00:57:33.604 --> 00:57:35.041
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.


574
00:57:35.146 --> 00:57:35.980
Right!

575
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:40.582
Rambo! This is your
last chance to come out.


576
00:57:41.686 --> 00:57:43.497
Maybe we should wait.

577
00:57:43.955 --> 00:57:46.413
Earl, this creep is a killer!

578
00:57:46.414 --> 00:57:49.080
Besides, I'm in charge
and I say we blow it up!


579
00:57:49.328 --> 00:57:53.036
Now fire that thing! Just let
me get outta the way first.


580
00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:19.991
Give that man a cigar!

581
00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:21.972
Bull's eye!

582
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:05.173
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.


583
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:10.214
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwa Jima.


584
00:59:12.922 --> 00:59:15.421
I don't believe it! Idiots!

585
00:59:16.338 --> 00:59:18.688
All right, one more for
''Soldier of Fortune''!


586
00:59:18.793 --> 00:59:19.837
Soldier of Fortune?!

587
00:59:20.315 --> 00:59:23.420
Dammit, what the hell do you
think this is, some kind of a circus?


588
00:59:23.525 --> 00:59:24.857
Get the hell outta here!

589
00:59:27.065 --> 00:59:27.855
Clinton, Jesus!

590
00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:30.335
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

591
00:59:30.336 --> 00:59:32.294
I told you people to
wait until I got up here!


592
00:59:32.334 --> 00:59:33.708
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!

593
00:59:33.709 --> 00:59:36.022
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.

594
00:59:38.647 --> 00:59:39.644
What a mess!

595
00:59:41.918 --> 00:59:44.375
We have to dig his body
out of there right away.


596
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.248
You can't get a dozer up here,

597
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.105
you're gonna have to find
somebody to dig him out!


598
00:59:49.499 --> 00:59:51.102
lt's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.


599
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.165
Will, come on...I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow!


600
00:59:54.209 --> 00:59:56.687
You'd better get started
right away, Clinton!


601
00:59:59.816 --> 01:00:00.859
Shit!

602
01:00:45.926 --> 01:00:48.508
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamned weekend warriors!


603
01:00:50.008 --> 01:00:51.570
Thought you said he was
the best you ever trained!


604
01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:53.862
However he may have ended up,

605
01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:55.694
there was a time when
he was very special.


606
01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:59.081
'Special', my ass! He was just
another drifter that broke the law.


607
01:00:59.187 --> 01:01:00.653
Vagrancy, wasn't it?

608
01:01:01.111 --> 01:01:03.986
That's gonna look real good on
his gravestone in Arlington:


609
01:01:04.716 --> 01:01:08.112
''Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor.


610
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:11.546
Survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines.


611
01:01:12.734 --> 01:01:15.172
Killed for vagrancy,
in 'Jerkwater', USA.


612
01:01:16.046 --> 01:01:17.961
Don't give me any of
that crap, Trautman!


613
01:01:18.899 --> 01:01:22.169
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?


614
01:01:22.315 --> 01:01:24.940
He killed a police
officer, for Christ sake!


615
01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:26.834
You're goddamned lucky
he didn't kill all of you...


616
01:01:44.146 --> 01:01:46.562
This character! He
comes waltzing in here,


617
01:01:46.563 --> 01:01:48.143
full of all kinds of good advice.

618
01:01:48.353 --> 01:01:51.168
And wished we'd let that
goddamned maniac go on the loose,


619
01:01:51.169 --> 01:01:52.421
so we could save our own asses!

620
01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:55.810
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.


621
01:01:56.373 --> 01:02:00.644
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!


622
01:03:33.797 --> 01:03:36.440
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.


623
01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:58.289
Colonel?

624
01:06:02.878 --> 01:06:03.834
Have a seat.

625
01:06:10.043 --> 01:06:12.564
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?

626
01:06:12.565 --> 01:06:15.085
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?


627
01:06:15.541 --> 01:06:18.084
A shot of wild turkey.

628
01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:24.625
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.


629
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:28.977
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?


630
01:06:30.893 --> 01:06:32.247
No, I guess not.

631
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.790
I suppose...

632
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:39.330
I just feel...

633
01:06:41.746 --> 01:06:45.329
Like you were...cheated
outta your chance?


634
01:06:45.913 --> 01:06:47.704
I wanted to kill that kid.

635
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.453
I wanted to kill him so
bad, I could taste it.


636
01:06:52.974 --> 01:06:55.055
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

637
01:06:56.389 --> 01:06:58.764
It can get confusing sometimes...

638
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.054
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and

639
01:07:03.055 --> 01:07:07.076
I got pretty confused. 
But we had orders.

640
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.617
When in doubt...kill!

641
01:07:14.866 --> 01:07:16.427
But what the hell, you're a civilian.

642
01:07:16.428 --> 01:07:19.189
You can go home to your wife,

643
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:20.804
and your house and
your little flower garden.


644
01:07:21.263 --> 01:07:23.198
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.


645
01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:24.204
And what about you, Colonel?

646
01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:25.716
What did you figure
out from all of this, huh?


647
01:07:26.761 --> 01:07:28.951
I mean what would you have
done with him if he came in?


648
01:07:29.282 --> 01:07:31.676
Would you wrap your arms
around him to give a big sloppy kiss?


649
01:07:32.176 --> 01:07:34.113
Or would you have blown his brains out?

650
01:07:42.883 --> 01:07:45.673
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face to face.


651
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:50.777
Well, there it is.

652
01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.027
Just as well we never
got a chance to find out.


653
01:09:47.176 --> 01:09:48.259
Drive!

654
01:09:50.926 --> 01:09:54.862
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!


655
01:09:55.924 --> 01:09:59.007
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.


656
01:09:59.508 --> 01:10:01.361
All right, what do you
got in the back, Robert A.?


657
01:10:01.884 --> 01:10:03.425
M60.

658
01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:09.794
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!


659
01:10:11.045 --> 01:10:12.088
Go home! Move, go home!

660
01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:39.628
Want to turn that up?

661
01:10:43.085 --> 01:10:45.334
What's your story, Steamboat?

662
01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:48.145
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon...


663
01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:51.083
That Rambo guy? 
He's on the loose again!

664
01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.126
Shit!

665
01:10:55.479 --> 01:10:58.708
Hey Will, it's Rambo! 
He's still around!

666
01:14:40.633 --> 01:14:44.132
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!


667
01:15:09.377 --> 01:15:11.253
What the hell is going on?!

668
01:15:14.378 --> 01:15:16.959
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!


669
01:15:27.127 --> 01:15:29.416
Attention, all civilians!

670
01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:34.396
For your own safety, please
evacuate the streets immediately.


671
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.956
Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.


672
01:15:39.018 --> 01:15:41.851
I repeat: this is a police emergency.

673
01:15:41.852 --> 01:15:44.580
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

674
01:16:03.162 --> 01:16:05.121
They found Rambo's body...

675
01:16:05.824 --> 01:16:08.805
As a matter of fact,
he stole an army truck


676
01:16:08.806 --> 01:16:11.264
and blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.


677
01:16:12.036 --> 01:16:13.472
The kid is resilient.

678
01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:17.157
Why don't you forget what you're
thinking and clear out while you can?


679
01:16:17.887 --> 01:16:20.182
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.


680
01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:22.991
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,


681
01:16:22.992 --> 01:16:25.636
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

682
01:16:27.034 --> 01:16:28.512
I suspected it.

683
01:16:28.866 --> 01:16:33.824
Sure...Sure, that's why you
stuck around. You trained him.


684
01:16:34.116 --> 01:16:36.614
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.


685
01:16:37.531 --> 01:16:39.449
But he's not gonna
get out of this place!


686
01:16:39.906 --> 01:16:42.364
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,


687
01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:44.196
what makes you think
you can handle him now?


688
01:16:45.324 --> 01:16:47.340
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.


689
01:16:59.403 --> 01:17:00.902
You're gonna die, Teasle.

690
01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:03.236
Everybody dies!

691
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.674
There's only one man in this
room that has half a chance.


692
01:17:06.675 --> 01:17:08.611
That's not because
I'm better than he is.


693
01:17:09.069 --> 01:17:10.611
But it's because he trusts me.

694
01:17:11.068 --> 01:17:13.087
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,


695
01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.523
and that may be
all the edge I need.

696
01:17:15.984 --> 01:17:18.274
Jesus Christ, where do
you people come from?


697
01:17:23.442 --> 01:17:26.252
This is my job Trautman,
this is my town!


698
01:17:26.606 --> 01:17:30.129
And I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!


699
01:17:30.691 --> 01:17:34.024
Now you just stay
the hell outta my way!

700
01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:45.396
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!


701
01:17:45.438 --> 01:17:46.853
lt's too goddamned hot!

702
01:17:48.772 --> 01:17:50.621
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

703
01:17:52.686 --> 01:17:55.852
Come on, let's go! Will, this
is Lester, do you copy, over?


704
01:17:57.062 --> 01:18:02.060
Listen Will, we've got some serious
problems. The highway's been cut off.


705
01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.352
The truck's out here, but
we couldn't find the body.


706
01:18:05.809 --> 01:18:07.412
I repeat: no body,
it's totally burnt out.


707
01:18:07.414 --> 01:18:09.328
Preston, get those people outta here!

708
01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:12.390
Move them back to the south side.

709
01:18:14.142 --> 01:18:18.931
We don't know how many gas
tanks there are under the pumps...


710
01:24:10.586 --> 01:24:13.546
Go ahead...go ahead!

711
01:24:14.296 --> 01:24:16.317
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch, finish me!


712
01:24:16.422 --> 01:24:17.503
Rambo!

713
01:24:18.462 --> 01:24:20.001
Rambo, don't do it!

714
01:24:20.959 --> 01:24:22.271
Listen to me, Rambo!

715
01:24:22.626 --> 01:24:23.626
You have no chance.

716
01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:26.147
Drop your weapon.

717
01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:31.166
We're gonna order a chopper
in and fly you back to Bragg.


718
01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:34.562
Hold your fire!

719
01:24:39.253 --> 01:24:40.186
Hold your fire!

720
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.272
Hold your fire! 
Hold your fire!

721
01:24:43.373 --> 01:24:44.871
Think about what you're doin'.

722
01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:50.164
The building's perimeter's
covered. No exits.


723
01:24:50.831 --> 01:24:53.539
There's nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s!


724
01:24:53.998 --> 01:24:56.244
You did everything to make
this private war happen.


725
01:24:57.579 --> 01:24:59.412
You've done enough damage!

726
01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:02.080
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?


727
01:25:03.579 --> 01:25:04.724
This mission is over!

728
01:25:08.287 --> 01:25:09.618
Look at 'em out there.

729
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:13.972
Look at 'em!

730
01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:18.824
If you won't end this
happen, they'll kill you!


731
01:25:20.327 --> 01:25:21.765
Is that what you want?

732
01:25:25.201 --> 01:25:28.012
lt's over, Johnny. lt's OVER!

733
01:25:28.367 --> 01:25:33.032
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!


734
01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:37.050
lt wasn't my war. You
asked me, I didn't ask you!


735
01:25:37.865 --> 01:25:41.052
And I did what I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.


736
01:25:41.615 --> 01:25:44.094
And I come back to
the world, and I see all


737
01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:46.781
those maggots at the
airport, protestin' me, spittin'.


738
01:25:47.345 --> 01:25:49.757
Callin' me baby killer
and all kinds of vile crap!


739
01:25:51.114 --> 01:25:53.721
Who are they to protest
me, huh? Who are they?


740
01:25:53.902 --> 01:25:55.467
Unless they've been me and been there,

741
01:25:55.468 --> 01:25:57.134
and know what the
hell they're yellin' about?


742
01:25:57.175 --> 01:26:00.591
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.


743
01:26:00.634 --> 01:26:03.247
FOR YOU! For me,
civilian life is nothing.


744
01:26:03.977 --> 01:26:05.651
In the field, we
had a code of honor.

745
01:26:05.903 --> 01:26:09.132
You watch my back, I watch
yours. Back here, there's nothing!


746
01:26:09.277 --> 01:26:13.173
You're the last of an elite
group...don't end it like this.


747
01:26:13.214 --> 01:26:15.798
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank,


748
01:26:15.902 --> 01:26:17.859
I was in charge of a
million dollar equipment!


749
01:26:18.108 --> 01:26:21.130
Back here, I can't even
hold a job parking cars!


750
01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:32.251
Where is everybody?

751
01:26:38.481 --> 01:26:41.146
I had a friend, who
was in the Air Force.


752
01:26:42.938 --> 01:26:47.229
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!


753
01:26:47.688 --> 01:26:49.314
Who were my friends!

754
01:26:49.355 --> 01:26:52.560
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?


755
01:26:54.145 --> 01:26:55.017
Wore this black headband.

756
01:26:55.228 --> 01:26:57.352
I took one of his magic
markers, and I said:


757
01:26:57.394 --> 01:26:59.894
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",

758
01:26:59.895 --> 01:27:01.663
'cause we were always
talkin' about Vegas,


759
01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:05.356
and this fuckin' car. This so
great '58 Chevy convertible!


760
01:27:05.357 --> 01:27:06.764
He was talkin' about his car,

761
01:27:06.765 --> 01:27:09.787
he said we'd get cruised
till the tires fell off!


762
01:27:17.725 --> 01:27:19.891
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up,


763
01:27:20.517 --> 01:27:22.577
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

764
01:27:22.765 --> 01:27:25.370
And there, he says:
''Shine please, shine!''


765
01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:29.140
I said no, and he kept askin',
yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.


766
01:27:29.598 --> 01:27:31.450
And...I went to get a couple of beers.

767
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:35.181
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...


768
01:27:35.637 --> 01:27:37.492
Fucking blew his
body all over the place.


769
01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:40.180
He's laying there and
he's fucking screaming,


770
01:27:40.181 --> 01:27:41.741
there's pieces of him all over me!

771
01:27:43.137 --> 01:27:47.116
And I'm trying to pull them off, you
know...my friend! It's all over me!


772
01:27:47.928 --> 01:27:49.240
I got blood and everything and...

773
01:27:49.241 --> 01:27:51.803
I'm trying to hold him
together, I put him together


774
01:27:51.845 --> 01:27:53.802
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

775
01:27:54.261 --> 01:27:56.095
And nobody would help!

776
01:27:56.594 --> 01:28:00.633
He's saying, sayin', ''I want to
go home!'' just calling my name.


777
01:28:01.092 --> 01:28:03.801
''I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"


778
01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:06.051
I said: "Why I can't
find your fuckin' legs."


779
01:28:06.925 --> 01:28:08.424
''I can't find your legs!''

780
01:28:10.175 --> 01:28:14.800
I can't get it out of my
head. lt was seven years.


781
01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:16.798
Every day it hurts.

782
01:28:17.299 --> 01:28:23.173
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.


783
01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:25.840
Sometimes a day.

784
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:29.422
Sometimes a week.

785
01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:33.256
I can't put it outta my mind...

786
01:28:33.257 --> 01:28:40.257
