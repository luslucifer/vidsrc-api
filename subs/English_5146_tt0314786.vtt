1
00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:11.374
You will see that her fingerprint
matches exactly.


2
00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:25.787
That's very nice. 
Very, very nice.

3
00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.768
So...

4
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:32.029
...when will your buyer have the money?

5
00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.230
He should have the money
within a week.


6
00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:36.602
You will do it in four days.

7
00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:39.811
Four days. That's sunday.

8
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.779
I've got something going on on sunday.

9
00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.781
Sunday will be fine. I'll work out
my schedule. I'll juggle it, not to worry.


10
00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:49.888
One more thing.

11
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:51.751
If I come to america with Olga...

12
00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:56.361
...you think you can get me tickets
to celine dion?


13
00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:00.592
I will not only get you tickets,
i will get you backstage.


14
00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:03.860
And if we're really lucky,
you'll have coffee with her, okay?


15
00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:08.867
Get down!

16
00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:06.431
There's your guys.
See you in four days?


17
00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:43.667
- How'd it go?
- Well, I had a minor snag.


18
00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:30.207
Not bad.

19
00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:33.318
I would've liked to gotten in
a double twist before the blowup.


20
00:05:36.322 --> 00:05:37.755
Heads up.

21
00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:43.025
- Thanks, doll-face.
- Anytime.


22
00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:45.220
You got any gum?

23
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:47.227
Put your thumb in there.

24
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.560
So cherkasov wants
to do the deal on sunday.


25
00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:52.931
The wedding's on sunday.

26
00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:57.539
I knew that.
I wouldn't forget my only son's wedding.


27
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.507
We'll just have to juggle.

28
00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:04.713
Don't think of it as a problem,
think of it as an opportunity for a solution.


29
00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:11.522
- So have you met the bride's family yet?
- No, I'm a little worried about that.


30
00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:14.692
- About what?
- Well, the father. He's a doctor.


31
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.591
You know how they are. They think
they're better than all the rest of us.


32
00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:21.528
He's probably a brain surgeon
or something.


33
00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:24.602
I need you to listen
to me carefully now...


34
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.171
...because it's getting very, very serious.

35
00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:30.198
All right.

36
00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:33.311
Now, the fungus on your toes
is coming back.


37
00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.442
Are you putting the powder in your shoes?
Are you using the cream at night?


38
00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:38.605
Sometimes.

39
00:06:38.784 --> 00:06:42.447
If a piano was falling on your head,
you move out of the way "sometimes"?


40
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:44.316
It's a fungus. 
I wasn't worried.

41
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.822
Start worrying! 
It doesn't hurt to worry.

42
00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:48.619
Dr. Peyser, your daughter's here.

43
00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:51.957
I'll be right back.

44
00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:54.791
- Hey, daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.


45
00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:56.457
What'd you want?

46
00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:00.061
The mortons are bringing
their children now.


47
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.665
- You know their 8-year-old, irwin?
- Yeah.


48
00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:05.242
He has a shoe fetish.

49
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.039
I had them at the table
with uncle Bernie and aunt Thelma...


50
00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:09.772
...but I think this is a problem.

51
00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.782
- Thelma was beaten up in a shoe store.
- My god.


52
00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:17.412
I don't wanna put them together. I'll move
bernie and thelma to the 12-step table.


53
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.285
Fine. Whatever you want, dad.

54
00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:22.518
I just don't want you to be too anxious
about the seating chart.


55
00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:25.926
No, I'm fine. I just want
the best wedding in the world, that's all.


56
00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:29.090
Marc's only requirement is that
his parents are at separate tables...


57
00:07:29.268 --> 00:07:31.498
...facing away from each other,
and out of earshot.


58
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.036
- I know.
- And his dad's coming over at 7 tonight.


59
00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:37.972
- I'll believe that when I see it.
- Marc swears he'll be there this time.


60
00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:41.978
- Well, I'm making a veal.
- Nice, dad.


61
00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:46.511
Okay, I'll sign off on this and fax it
to the new caterer and we're done.


62
00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:48.846
- The new caterer?
- Yeah, you know that.


63
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:51.387
Daddy, you fired another caterer?

64
00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:56.551
They weren't caterers.
That was a man and his wife and lettuce.


65
00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:01.462
Okay. Fine. I didn't even want a caterer,
i just wanted six people and a beach, but...


66
00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:05.536
Melissa, this is what you want.
This is the wedding you'll remember.


67
00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:07.534
You're right.

68
00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.230
Thank you, dad.

69
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.499
Bye.

70
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.437
Get the beach out of your head,
it's overrated.


71
00:08:13.612 --> 00:08:16.877
You'll be standing there in front
of an e. Coli sign.


72
00:08:18.617 --> 00:08:22.678
Shit. We got a fire in number one again.
Got any halon left?


73
00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:24.117
Barely.

74
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.689
We're losing altitude.

75
00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:27.382
We're coming up on nova scotia.

76
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.188
- How about thibodoux?
- You're meeting his person tonight.


77
00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:32.523
I can't tonight.
I've got the in-laws for dinner.


78
00:08:32.698 --> 00:08:34.393
I've blown them off three times.

79
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.933
I can meet with thibodoux's person.
You do the parent thing.


80
00:08:37.102 --> 00:08:38.535
No. You're not ready yet.

81
00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:42.772
- Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
- Who got you into this business?


82
00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:46.901
I taught you everything you know.
When you're ready, you can take the lead.


83
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:51.516
I'll figure it out tonight.
I'll just improvise.


84
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.240
Okay, here we go.

85
00:08:54.587 --> 00:08:58.045
Mayday, mayday! Lear niner-whiskey-mike
approaching cape breton.


86
00:09:22.114 --> 00:09:24.844
And this is when Melissa
went bungee jumping.


87
00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:26.712
She's so crazy.

88
00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.150
- Was that my dad?
- Nope.


89
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:31.551
Your father seems
to be working all the time.


90
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:35.256
I had no idea selling xerox machines
was so demanding.


91
00:09:35.427 --> 00:09:38.328
It's a wild ride.
Yeah, but he loves it.


92
00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:40.795
I have an announcement to make!

93
00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:47.098
The glaze on the veal is now a laminate.
It's like a plastic jacket.


94
00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:50.637
He doesn't usually cook.
He can't handle the pressure.


95
00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:53.734
I'd just like to know
what day we're gonna eat.


96
00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:55.907
He's here.

97
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.747
Here we go.

98
00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:02.483
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

99
00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:07.615
My apologies. Engine trouble.
Mea culpa. Mea culpa to the tenth power...


100
00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:09.090
are you Katherine?

101
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:12.560
Oh, my god! Marc said you were gorgeous,
but he didn't do you justice.


102
00:10:12.731 --> 00:10:14.961
- Come here. Come here.
- Well, thank you.


103
00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:18.393
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

104
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.267
Good to see you.
Hi, buddy. Sorry, business.


105
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.841
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be at the rehearsal dinner.


106
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.341
Okay, good.

107
00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:29.003
Boy, do you have a beautiful house here.

108
00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:32.284
What is that, veal jerky?

109
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:35.011
We passed jerky about an hour ago.

110
00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:38.723
This has gotta be the doctor.

111
00:10:38.891 --> 00:10:40.483
- Come here.
- That's all right.


112
00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.526
- Come here. Come on.
- No, I don't like this.


113
00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:51.026
Thank you, Jer. I don't need your watch.
I've already got my own right here.


114
00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:53.603
What are you talking about?

115
00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:57.366
How did you do that?

116
00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:08.179
- I love magic tricks!
- That's wonderful.


117
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.085
Breaks the ice a little bit, huh?
Gets that party going!


118
00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:16.058
All right. That's very entertaining.

119
00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:18.321
Dad, does he get the watch back?

120
00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:22.194
Of course! I just feel terrible about the meal,
so dinner is on me!


121
00:11:22.368 --> 00:11:25.394
He who is tardy
pays for the party, okay?

122
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.931
Jer, Katherine, what do you feel like?
Ethnic food?


123
00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:31.332
How ethnic?

124
00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:40.148
This place is gonna
knock your socks off.


125
00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:43.386
I'll meet you inside, okay?
Dad, can I have a second with you?


126
00:11:50.195 --> 00:11:52.755
- At least the dog looks fresh.
- Just relax, honey.


127
00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:54.626
The whole schmoozy salesman thing...

128
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.098
- yeah, how's that playing?
- Take it down a notch.


129
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:59.567
Yeah, okay, I got you. Thanks.

130
00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:07.277
Good evening and welcome to Quan Lee.
Table for five?


131
00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:11.041
- Are you full tonight?
- Expecting to be any moment, sir.


132
00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:24.160
This is Quan Lee.
He's the owner of the place here.


133
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:33.031
Quan Lee and I did some copy-related work
in vietnam together.


134
00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:35.867
Katherine, why don't you sit over here.

135
00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:45.273
He had a copier with a paper slot
that was choked with paper.


136
00:12:51.557 --> 00:12:53.320
So I destroyed the copier.

137
00:12:54.326 --> 00:12:56.351
Dad's always got great stories.

138
00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:11.635
Tastes like beer,
but it's got an incredible buzz.


139
00:13:14.213 --> 00:13:15.680
This guy gets around.

140
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:19.682
He's chased across prague in the morning,
has dinner with u.s. Contacts that night.


141
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.988
- So have you ever been to vietnam?
- No, but we hear it's lovely.


142
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:31.288
Jerry prefers to stay in one place.

143
00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:35.194
He had an anxiety attack
watching an airline commercial once.


144
00:13:35.367 --> 00:13:38.165
Honey, I did not have an anxiety attack.

145
00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:42.865
If I remember correctly, that airline is now
out of business, so thank you very much.


146
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:47.501
Jer, I'm with you. I like to be in control.
I like to be right there in the driver's seat.


147
00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:50.045
In which case,
pray you're not a passenger.


148
00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:53.150
Marc doesn't like the way I drive.

149
00:13:53.318 --> 00:13:56.549
Am I wrong? I look at traffic signals
sort of as a suggestion.


150
00:13:56.722 --> 00:13:59.316
In that case, you would be wrong.

151
00:13:59.658 --> 00:14:00.647
He would.

152
00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:02.823
- Who's that?
- Which one?


153
00:14:02.995 --> 00:14:04.929
- The guy on the left.
- Just a sec.


154
00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:12.527
You got him?

155
00:14:16.008 --> 00:14:17.908
I've got no id.

156
00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:19.873
He could be deep cover.

157
00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:21.706
Menus.

158
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.585
Would you like me to bring you
some arm extenders with that?


159
00:14:27.753 --> 00:14:29.846
No, I'm fine, thank you. I'm just...

160
00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:32.047
I'm stretching.

161
00:14:35.394 --> 00:14:38.454
We'll have the house special, please.

162
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.257
Excellent.

163
00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:47.228
Extra hot.
Let me check, make sure they do it right.


164
00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:51.069
But whatever you bring extra hot,
bring out mild too.


165
00:14:52.377 --> 00:14:53.435
Or eggs!

166
00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:01.717
Can we hold this off
for about two hours?


167
00:15:02.221 --> 00:15:05.952
I have to wire my employer
in 30 minutes.


168
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.088
Jer, wait till you see the special.
You are gonna flip out.


169
00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:16.325
- We're very excited.
- I can't wait.


170
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:25.409
Jer, you all right?
You haven't touched your food.


171
00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:28.068
My food is still eating.

172
00:15:28.347 --> 00:15:31.180
- Well, I think it's time for a toast.
- Hear, hear.


173
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.648
Marc, buddy...

174
00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:36.583
...seems like yesterday you
were just starting school.


175
00:15:38.156 --> 00:15:40.090
What was the name of that school?

176
00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:42.250
- Horton?
- Horton, yeah.


177
00:15:42.594 --> 00:15:47.054
Sorry. I should have gotten there
a little more often.


178
00:15:47.232 --> 00:15:50.531
But look at you now,
out of law school...


179
00:15:50.702 --> 00:15:55.833
...working with a brand-new firm,
about to marry this beautiful girl.


180
00:16:01.813 --> 00:16:03.474
Where did the time go, man?

181
00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:14.722
I gotta go to the john.

182
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:17.885
Oh, I'm sorry.

183
00:16:18.063 --> 00:16:20.497
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


184
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:22.361
Cheers.

185
00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:37.671
You haven't even tasted it.

186
00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:40.647
Have you seen the discovery channel?
This is one of the stars.


187
00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:43.645
You might as well eat
barbara walters.


188
00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:48.424
I'm going to the bathroom.

189
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.728
I don't like to be kept waiting.

190
00:16:51.396 --> 00:16:53.193
You know we're hot?

191
00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:57.267
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it now. Take it out.


192
00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:06.004
- Should I put it in?
- I'll do it.


193
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.844
Very well. Good old Olga.

194
00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:19.015
She's in good shape for a 20-year-old
runaway. Where is she exactly?


195
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:21.716
I'll tell you when I get the money.

196
00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:27.231
Bring the proof to monsieur thibodoux.

197
00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:29.424
I'll wire him now,
tell him you check out.

198
00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:31.796
I'm not going to france,
i just came from europe.


199
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.631
I'm barely adjusted
to the time change.


200
00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:36.069
This deal has gotta go down
by sunday.


201
00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:38.607
You are not serious
about brokering a deal for Olga.


202
00:17:38.777 --> 00:17:40.540
I'm serious...

203
00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:45.143
hey, Jer?

204
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:50.115
- You're not a stall-peeper, are you?
- No. No.


205
00:17:50.288 --> 00:17:54.315
Because they got a website for guys like
you. I think you ought to take it online.


206
00:17:54.493 --> 00:17:57.519
Actually, I dropped a quarter, and...

207
00:17:57.696 --> 00:18:00.290
- it's not in there?
- No.


208
00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:03.901
I don't need it. I'm all right. Thanks.

209
00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:11.608
Yeah, could I do this alone?

210
00:18:11.777 --> 00:18:13.540
You're not centered.

211
00:18:13.712 --> 00:18:17.842
Would you mind? It's too close for me.
I have a shy bladder.


212
00:18:18.183 --> 00:18:19.445
Oh, great.

213
00:18:19.618 --> 00:18:21.108
Talk to me on day six.

214
00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:26.053
Jer, you still here?
Oh, you got that shy bladder thing, huh?


215
00:18:26.224 --> 00:18:29.057
That's pretty common.

216
00:18:29.494 --> 00:18:31.792
Buddy, you mind?
My friend is trying to take a pee.


217
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.462
Well, well. What do we have here?

218
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.972
- I'll come back.
- No, you stay where you are, Jer.


219
00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:46.736
This man's just about to leave.

220
00:18:49.014 --> 00:18:50.311
Excuse me.

221
00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:51.813
What is this? I mean, what...?

222
00:18:51.983 --> 00:18:54.008
Next time I see a woman
in the men's room...


223
00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:57.019
...l'm calling management!
Can you believe this?


224
00:18:57.189 --> 00:18:58.781
Doug?

225
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.338
That's it, we're going home.
The wedding is off.


226
00:19:14.506 --> 00:19:16.872
What? Dad, what are you talking about?

227
00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:19.306
- What happened?
- He beat up a guy in the bathroom.


228
00:19:19.478 --> 00:19:21.969
He wasn't even going to the bathroom
to begin with.


229
00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.479
- Dad, you're going insane.
- I'm already there.


230
00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:26.610
I got it.

231
00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:32.722
An unconscious person.
You must be working.


232
00:19:32.891 --> 00:19:35.587
The first thing I noticed about the guy
is he supinates.


233
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.921
- So?
- His shoes show medial heel erosion.


234
00:19:38.096 --> 00:19:40.997
Only pronators have that!
Never mind, it's technical.


235
00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:42.656
Marc is a wonderful guy.

236
00:19:43.034 --> 00:19:44.865
But this is too much for me
to handle.


237
00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:47.334
Fine. Don't marry Marc, I will.

238
00:19:47.506 --> 00:19:50.100
- Jerry.
- Don't "Jerry" me now. Let's go.


239
00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:53.403
- Oh, sweetheart...
- honey, let's go. Let's go. Now.


240
00:19:53.578 --> 00:19:55.273
Mom!

241
00:19:55.914 --> 00:19:56.972
I tried to push this...

242
00:19:57.148 --> 00:20:00.208
it's bad enough you screwed up your life.
I won't let you screw up mine.


243
00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:01.852
I'll make this up to you.

244
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.514
No, no, no! You listen.
Don't apologize to me, apologize to them.


245
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.420
You fix this. You fix this.

246
00:20:12.197 --> 00:20:14.290
Okay. I hear you.

247
00:20:16.668 --> 00:20:18.659
I'm sorry about my father.

248
00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:21.101
Honey, I'm sorry about my father.

249
00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:23.434
- Here.
- Thanks.


250
00:20:23.608 --> 00:20:25.200
- I have an idea.
- Yeah?


251
00:20:25.377 --> 00:20:30.440
Let's you and me leave town immediately.
Let's escape our wedding.


252
00:20:30.615 --> 00:20:32.606
There's no escaping.

253
00:20:32.784 --> 00:20:34.877
- Really?
- Really.


254
00:20:35.053 --> 00:20:37.647
Isn't this supposed to be about us?

255
00:20:37.822 --> 00:20:44.125
Sweet, funny, whimsical Melissa.
Weddings aren't about the bride and groom.


256
00:20:53.738 --> 00:20:56.571
- There he is! He's inside! Let's move!
- Go!


257
00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:10.011
Get that out!

258
00:21:12.157 --> 00:21:13.715
Some doctors like to operate...

259
00:21:13.892 --> 00:21:17.658
...but I believe in exhausting all
non-surgical techniques first.


260
00:21:17.829 --> 00:21:20.855
This gentleman, however,
will need surgery.


261
00:21:21.032 --> 00:21:23.865
- What?
- I'm sorry. That's my fault.


262
00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:26.663
I should've told you that privately.
It slipped out.


263
00:21:26.838 --> 00:21:29.500
It's not a big deal.
At worst, you'd lose a toe.


264
00:21:29.674 --> 00:21:32.006
- Oh, my god.
- It rarely happens.


265
00:21:37.682 --> 00:21:40.776
All right, gorgeous, you arrange
for the plane. I'll be right back.


266
00:21:40.952 --> 00:21:45.218
Are you sure about this? We've got
the fbi on us like trailer trash on velveeta.


267
00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:50.751
Yeah. No, I promised Marc.
Besides, I owe the guy an apology.


268
00:22:09.014 --> 00:22:13.314
Okay, guys,
let's try and keep a low profile.


269
00:22:30.902 --> 00:22:34.030
Since we're talking
about the sesamoid bones...


270
00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:37.936
...let's see their role in the deformity
anatomically known as...


271
00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:42.739
...hallux abducto valgus, or what?
The...?


272
00:22:42.914 --> 00:22:44.404
The bunion.

273
00:22:44.582 --> 00:22:47.710
The bunion...
what? What are you doing here?


274
00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:51.083
Listen to you.
You're mr. Medical authority.


275
00:22:51.256 --> 00:22:54.589
I asked you on the phone not to come here.
I don't want to see you again.


276
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.019
I just wanted to apologize and make sure
that you don't have any problem with me...


277
00:22:59.197 --> 00:23:03.099
...that would interfere with the wedding.
- There's not gonna be a wedding.


278
00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:07.531
- Would you like us to step outside, sir?
- No, I wouldn't.


279
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.967
Do you know what a remarkable teacher
you have here?


280
00:23:13.144 --> 00:23:18.275
This man was chosen chicago's podiatrist
of the year three years in a row!


281
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.748
So let's give him a hand, huh?

282
00:23:24.556 --> 00:23:26.490
Would you please leave right now?

283
00:23:26.658 --> 00:23:30.116
Five minutes, a cup of coffee.
I just want to iron out a couple of things.


284
00:23:30.295 --> 00:23:32.991
If I give you five minutes,
will you leave me alone forever?


285
00:23:33.164 --> 00:23:35.530
Of course I will.

286
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:41.297
I need five minutes. All right?
Just relax. I'll be right back.


287
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.966
Thank you.

288
00:23:43.141 --> 00:23:44.733
This is where I work.

289
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:48.208
I don't bother you when you're
in the bathroom with your hookers.


290
00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:52.941
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please. Olga, the 20-year-old runaway.


291
00:23:53.118 --> 00:23:57.452
What are you doing?
No more magic tricks! Thank you.


292
00:23:57.622 --> 00:24:00.090
- What happened? What is that?
- You! Freeze!


293
00:24:00.592 --> 00:24:02.082
What?

294
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.485
- What happened?
- I said, freeze!


295
00:24:06.064 --> 00:24:07.929
How'd it go?

296
00:24:08.266 --> 00:24:10.166
Patch things up with the family?

297
00:24:10.435 --> 00:24:12.960
Well, not really.

298
00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:14.805
Come on.

299
00:24:17.475 --> 00:24:19.409
Watch your head, sir.

300
00:24:26.985 --> 00:24:28.953
You took my picture?

301
00:24:29.154 --> 00:24:32.021
Jerome Allen Peyser,

302
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.559
Subject was apprehended in possession
of 9.4 milliliters of fissile nuclear waste.


303
00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:39.325
- Fissile what?
- Yeah, right.


304
00:24:39.497 --> 00:24:42.022
Next you'll tell me
you've never heard of Olga.


305
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.327
The 20-year-old runaway.

306
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.501
Hey, I don't know what that means.
I overheard it!


307
00:24:48.673 --> 00:24:51.642
Listen, I'm a foot doctor.

308
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.213
- I want a name. What's your name?
- Hutchins. Now I get to ask a question.


309
00:24:56.381 --> 00:24:58.474
Where'd you get that canister from,
this man?


310
00:25:19.604 --> 00:25:21.071
That's him!

311
00:25:21.573 --> 00:25:23.564
That's the guy who I got it from!

312
00:25:23.741 --> 00:25:25.538
The homeless guy? Great.

313
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.004
- An arms dealer and a smart-ass.
- Arms dealer?


314
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.341
- What happened to pimp?
- Fine. You're a pimp.


315
00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:34.883
- No, I'm nothing! It's him!
- Who?


316
00:25:36.988 --> 00:25:39.081
The meter maid is the hostess!

317
00:25:39.924 --> 00:25:43.087
- Nobody is who they are.
- Sounds like you're tripping on drugs, pal.


318
00:25:44.963 --> 00:25:46.760
Look, he's talking to me!

319
00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:50.959
Hi, there.

320
00:26:11.856 --> 00:26:14.120
- I think I breathed a little!
- Don't be such a pussy.


321
00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:18.661
Don't call me a pussy! You just made me
radioactive with your fissile nuclear waste!


322
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.321
Bet you never said that
sentence before, Jer.


323
00:26:21.499 --> 00:26:24.559
- I don't even know what it means!
- Some things you shouldn't know.


324
00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:26.101
You probably gave me leukemia!

325
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:28.262
Oh, you're gonna be fine.
Now, hop in.


326
00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:30.907
I'm not hopping anywhere with you.

327
00:26:31.075 --> 00:26:34.476
Jer, we are family. And don't make
me do something I don't wanna do.


328
00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:36.341
We're not family.
There's not gonna be...


329
00:26:37.482 --> 00:26:39.347
I'm going! I'm going!

330
00:26:39.517 --> 00:26:40.575
Now, you hold on tight.

331
00:26:40.752 --> 00:26:43.312
It's a cushman.
It goes 5 miles an hour.


332
00:26:43.488 --> 00:26:44.955
Not this one.

333
00:26:46.991 --> 00:26:48.322
All right, slow down!

334
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.284
Listen, while I got you here...

335
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:53.794
...i wanted to tell you I'm so sorry
i had to drag you through all this.


336
00:26:53.965 --> 00:26:55.956
All right, there's a car!

337
00:26:57.468 --> 00:26:59.026
Okay, wait a minute!

338
00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:04.870
- Is that a fanny pack?
- Yes.


339
00:27:06.811 --> 00:27:08.642
What's so funny?

340
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.808
There's a taxi! 
Oh, my god, a taxi!

341
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:16.146
This isn't funny. 
There's a girl!

342
00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:21.787
Ostop this! Stop the little thing!

343
00:27:23.561 --> 00:27:25.791
Jer, I'm worried about you.

344
00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:29.695
You just don't look good.
Let me get you a glass of water.


345
00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:32.893
What's the plane situation?
Will I make it to thibodoux's in time?


346
00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:35.437
It shouldn't be a problem.
You have tailwinds.


347
00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:37.267
He's expecting you at 3.

348
00:27:37.442 --> 00:27:40.639
- You want me with you, I can rejig.
- Here you go. No, I need you here.


349
00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:43.542
I wanna make sure cherkasov is okay
with the chicago drop.


350
00:27:43.715 --> 00:27:46.548
Jer. Jer. Don't go there, Jer.

351
00:27:46.718 --> 00:27:48.208
Jer.

352
00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:54.854
You're really gonna have
to work on your listening skills.


353
00:27:55.827 --> 00:27:57.795
Mr. Xerox.

354
00:27:57.962 --> 00:28:00.556
Well, a great supply of copiers
you have here.


355
00:28:00.732 --> 00:28:03.724
I like the one shaped like a rocket launcher.
Does it collate?


356
00:28:04.102 --> 00:28:05.831
Is that a fanny pack?

357
00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:07.995
- It's cute, isn't it?
- It's adorable.


358
00:28:08.172 --> 00:28:11.733
Yeah, it's a fanny pack. I'm a doctor,
something you know nothing about.


359
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:13.536
I'm riveted. Go on.

360
00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:16.240
I have a phone
in here and a pager...

361
00:28:16.414 --> 00:28:19.008
...and some lorna doones,
in case I get hungry.


362
00:28:19.283 --> 00:28:21.877
And I also have
a personal attack alarm...


363
00:28:22.053 --> 00:28:24.886
...and if you come near me again,
I'm gonna use it!


364
00:28:26.457 --> 00:28:28.516
She hit me!

365
00:28:29.527 --> 00:28:30.789
Did you like it?

366
00:28:30.962 --> 00:28:34.557
What is wrong with you?
Something's really wrong.


367
00:28:34.732 --> 00:28:39.294
So just tell me what you are. A smuggler?
A pimp? You deal in russian runaways?


368
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.031
Yeah, we're all those things and more.
We are deep undercover.


369
00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.468
We're the cia.

370
00:28:46.844 --> 00:28:48.277
Great.

371
00:28:48.446 --> 00:28:50.209
Now we have to kill him.

372
00:28:50.381 --> 00:28:52.747
- Oh, ange, enough already.
- Fine.


373
00:28:53.117 --> 00:28:56.245
I'm gonna go salvage what's left
of my personal life.


374
00:28:59.257 --> 00:29:02.192
- I don't believe anything you're saying.
- It's better that way.


375
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.158
The one thing you should know
is that we are the good guys.


376
00:29:05.329 --> 00:29:07.991
Okay. Look, I didn't see anything.
I'll never tell a soul.


377
00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:11.294
- So take me home and I'm done.
- We'll talk about it on the plane.


378
00:29:11.602 --> 00:29:13.399
I don't fly. There's no plane.

379
00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:17.337
Doctor, do you know what a roofie is?

380
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:21.274
Yeah, I know what a roofie is.
Frat boys give them to girls at parties.


381
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.940
Oh, no, no.

382
00:29:28.252 --> 00:29:30.618
Oh, don't rape me.

383
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.628
Hello?

384
00:30:17.616 --> 00:30:19.413
Hey, Jer.

385
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:21.312
We're on a plane!

386
00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:24.479
Yes, we are. And you're
doing quite well, I might add.


387
00:30:24.657 --> 00:30:26.682
I'm making myself an omelet.
You hungry?


388
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:27.951
I feel sick.

389
00:30:28.127 --> 00:30:30.595
How did that stuff work out
that I put in your drink?


390
00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:31.991
Gives you a hell of a kick.

391
00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:34.630
People say they wake up so refreshed.

392
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.698
You gave me a roofie.

393
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:41.128
- There's nobody flying!
- No, Gulfstream 5, top of the line.


394
00:30:41.307 --> 00:30:42.569
This baby flies itself.

395
00:30:43.242 --> 00:30:46.973
This one, I think,
belongs to Barbra Streisand.


396
00:30:47.146 --> 00:30:50.479
- What kind of omelet fillings you want?
- You stole Barbra Streisand's plane?


397
00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:53.880
I borrowed it. It's not like we're going
to the bahamas or anything.


398
00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:56.452
I mean, this is official business.

399
00:30:57.323 --> 00:31:00.053
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Bathroom's right behind me.


400
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.391
I'm really proud of you, Jer. I think
you really conquered this flying thing.


401
00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:06.724
You're my hero.

402
00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:45.264
You have dialed
an invalid country code.


403
00:31:45.471 --> 00:31:48.565
Okay, Marc is such a wonderful guy.

404
00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:53.905
And you are so lucky.

405
00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:57.480
I'm gonna get so drunk.

406
00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:13.589
I'm totally fine.
I fall all the time, you guys.


407
00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.165
I fall every day.

408
00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:18.899
- Marc?
- Melissa, it's your father!


409
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:20.766
- Dad?
- Honey.


410
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.167
Dad, I can't hear anything.
You're breaking up.


411
00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:24.707
I can't hear anything.

412
00:32:24.877 --> 00:32:27.277
- Jerry?
- Katherine!


413
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:31.246
I am in the bathroom
of Barbra Streisand's airplane.


414
00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:33.647
Steve is taking me to france!

415
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:37.046
Honey, your father's going to france
with Barbra Streisand!


416
00:32:37.222 --> 00:32:38.814
What?!

417
00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:41.289
Babs! Babs!

418
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.792
I'm not going to france
with Barbra Streisand!


419
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.021
So, what's she like? Is she nice?

420
00:32:46.198 --> 00:32:47.460
She's not here!

421
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:49.066
I love Barbra Streisand.

422
00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:52.362
- They're taking me against my will!
- This doesn't make any sense.


423
00:32:52.538 --> 00:32:55.769
These things don't have to make sense,
Katherine. Call everyone.


424
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:57.340
All the authorities!

425
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:58.806
Do it now!

426
00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:01.537
Is Melissa okay?
She said something to me in the office.


427
00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:04.511
I'm worried about her.
Put her back on the phone!


428
00:33:05.184 --> 00:33:06.344
Jerry?

429
00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:09.346
- Yeah?
- Hey, Jer, you fall in?


430
00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:11.055
Yeah, I did. I fell in.

431
00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:13.015
I'll be out in a minute.

432
00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:15.782
Hello?

433
00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:19.287
Mom, can you come here for a minute?

434
00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:26.003
Oh, no. This is about the tax return,
isn't it?


435
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.672
You ever been to france, Jer?

436
00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:37.039
No.

437
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.875
I think we're flying way too low.

438
00:33:41.587 --> 00:33:45.318
Well, we gotta stay under the radar.
It makes things a little less complicated.


439
00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:47.356
Yeah, but this is just too low.

440
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.726
Let me tell you about this guy we're gonna
see. His name is Jean-Pierre thibodoux.


441
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.388
Now, he is a smuggler of the worst kind.
But not to worry, all right?


442
00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:57.432
We're just going in and out.

443
00:33:57.603 --> 00:33:59.400
Gotta pick up $ 170 million.

444
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:04.440
Hopefully broker a deal where I can bust
both the buyer and seller, put them in jail.


445
00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:07.236
You're getting $ 170 million?

446
00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.506
Yeah. It's chump change for a guy
like that. Once he's got Olga...


447
00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:14.083
...he can control the black market
in the u.s., russia and the middle east.


448
00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:16.344
So everybody wants this Olga.

449
00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:19.718
Oh, my god. Oh, no.
What's this shaking?


450
00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:22.019
What is that? That's too much!

451
00:34:22.194 --> 00:34:23.183
Oh, Jer...

452
00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:25.927
...do you know anything
about flying a G5?


453
00:34:26.098 --> 00:34:27.395
That's not funny!

454
00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:30.694
I'm serious, Jer.
There's something wrong here.


455
00:34:32.604 --> 00:34:35.038
What are you doing?
Why are you banging that?


456
00:34:35.207 --> 00:34:37.732
Do you know how you put
the landing gear down in this?


457
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.540
You don't know where the landing gear is?
How can you not know that?!


458
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:47.414
I got you so good, didn't i, Jer?

459
00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:50.744
You son of a...

460
00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:59.793
my husband couldn't possibly
be buying a...


461
00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:02.966
- could you please repeat that?
- A stealth nuclear submarine.


462
00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:06.831
Missing since 1998. the commander
of the fleet, one alexei cherkasov...


463
00:35:07.072 --> 00:35:10.906
...now a kingpin with the russian mob,
has been selling stolen military equipment.


464
00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:14.036
This is his big-ticket item.
And we found a sample...


465
00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:17.148
...of her fissile nuclear waste
in your husband's possession.


466
00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:18.908
Fissile nuclear what?

467
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.617
Each submarine emits
a kind of radioactive waste...


468
00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:25.416
...which bears a unique imprint to that
particular sub. A proof of possession.


469
00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:28.215
You guys,
my dad wouldn't buy a russian sub.


470
00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:30.258
I mean,
he won't even buy a foreign car.


471
00:35:30.696 --> 00:35:32.493
Place is clean.

472
00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:34.427
Thank you.

473
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.192
We'll be in touch.

474
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:38.832
Guys, let's go.

475
00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.940
When I opened the door,
i thought they were strippers.


476
00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:48.771
So I'm in france because
of submarine piss.


477
00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:50.209
Yeah, it's nutty, isn't it?

478
00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:52.475
Think what you'll
tell your grandchildren.


479
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:56.246
Of course, you're gonna be sworn
to secrecy, so you won't be able to, but...


480
00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:59.754
who are these guys?

481
00:36:00.626 --> 00:36:03.561
Hi, how are you? Nice hair.

482
00:36:04.763 --> 00:36:06.856
I don't understand something!

483
00:36:07.032 --> 00:36:08.522
Why would a smuggler want a...?

484
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.034
Large, armed,
virtually undetectable transport vehicle?


485
00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:15.372
Right.

486
00:36:15.641 --> 00:36:18.166
So he moves drugs, munitions,
everything.


487
00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:21.801
World falls apart,
this guy makes a fortune.


488
00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.119
I see a lot of guns.

489
00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:41.061
Did you ever think it's because
you want to see the guns?


490
00:36:41.233 --> 00:36:45.431
I mean, I look around,
i see birds, flowers, beautiful girls.


491
00:36:45.604 --> 00:36:47.629
The cup is half-full.

492
00:36:47.806 --> 00:36:51.640
You know, you gotta stop,
smell the roses.


493
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:53.667
Arms up.

494
00:36:56.381 --> 00:37:00.909
Please be careful. I have very
sensitive underarms. I just don't...


495
00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:03.850
I'm not kidding.
Don't do that, please. Please!


496
00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:11.528
Fanny pack?

497
00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.536
By the way, this fanny pack comes
from france.


498
00:37:28.146 --> 00:37:29.545
Take a good look, boys.

499
00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:33.048
I've been known to shoot tranq darts
from my knees.


500
00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:40.551
Look at you.

501
00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:43.251
You're just an old guy pretending
to be a little kid.


502
00:37:43.729 --> 00:37:44.718
Knee brace.

503
00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:47.657
The brace is for getting through
metal detectors.


504
00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:50.927
Distracts them from the knife
in my shoe.


505
00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:52.294
Steven!

506
00:37:55.574 --> 00:37:58.099
Jean-Pierre.
Come on.


507
00:38:00.379 --> 00:38:02.438
One little thing I almost forgot.

508
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:05.208
I've been known to travel
with some dangerous types...


509
00:38:05.384 --> 00:38:08.581
...so he might think that you're
an arms dealer or a deadly assassin.


510
00:38:08.754 --> 00:38:11.018
- So you just play along with it, okay?
- What?


511
00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:13.180
Just play along at being a deadly...

512
00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:15.918
silent, but deadly.

513
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:27.504
We must hold our introduction.

514
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:30.639
Please, gentlemen, walk with me.

515
00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:44.552
This man was caught stealing from me.

516
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.225
Were this one year ago,
i would torture him to death.


517
00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:51.260
But I have made some personal growth.
You notice it, right?


518
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.398
I noticed right off the bat,
Jean-Pierre.


519
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:57.601
Well, I'm calmer now. I am more centered.
I spent some time with deepak chopra.


520
00:38:57.769 --> 00:39:02.001
He wrote molecules of emotion and
natural healing for anxiety and depression.


521
00:39:02.641 --> 00:39:05.474
I have learned how to forgive.

522
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:24.856
Run for your life!

523
00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:47.516
- I know I need to do more work on myself.
- You're doing great, j.p.


524
00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:49.449
I did not get your name.

525
00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:51.282
Jerry.

526
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:54.682
- You don't know who this guy is?
- No.


527
00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.222
The Fat Cobra.

528
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.767
Well, I am honored.

529
00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:11.237
I hope we shall get
to know each other better.


530
00:40:16.648 --> 00:40:18.343
Follow me.

531
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:21.814
Exactly who am i?

532
00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:26.151
A legendary crime leader known only
as the Fat Cobra.


533
00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:28.087
Fat Cobra?

534
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.993
So, what does that refer to?
A snake? Slithery? Venomous? What?


535
00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:36.861
No, not exactly. 
It refers to...

536
00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:42.634
oh. Shit.

537
00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:56.679
Your contact will meet the seller
in chicago on sunday.


538
00:40:56.855 --> 00:41:00.484
- Then he'll give him Olga's location.
- It was nova scotia on wednesday.


539
00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:03.592
It's chicago on sunday.
What do you want from me?


540
00:41:03.929 --> 00:41:06.056
I'm the middleman here.

541
00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:15.695
One hundred and seventy
in cash and bearer bonds.


542
00:41:15.874 --> 00:41:18.502
But I don't hand over cash
before seeing the merchandise.


543
00:41:18.677 --> 00:41:21.874
J.p., who gave you the rocket launchers
last month on credit?


544
00:41:22.047 --> 00:41:25.414
How long have we known each other?
Years.


545
00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:28.742
All right, I trust you.

546
00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:31.018
Besides, if you try to screw me...

547
00:41:31.189 --> 00:41:34.090
...i will kill you
and everyone you've ever met.


548
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.226
That's great, huh? 
That's great...

549
00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:42.423
shit, that knee.

550
00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:44.364
Wanna wait while I count the money...

551
00:41:44.536 --> 00:41:46.299
...or take a walk?
- We'll wait here.


552
00:41:46.471 --> 00:41:52.205
No! I would love nothing more than to
share a drink with the legendary Fat Cobra.


553
00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:33.580
Those mosquitoes are bad
this time of year.


554
00:42:53.872 --> 00:42:57.069
So you're buying a submarine.
Well, that'll be nice.


555
00:42:57.242 --> 00:43:01.178
Wonderful.
Now I can take anything anywhere.


556
00:43:01.346 --> 00:43:05.783
Cocaine, nuclear devices.
Whatever you want, I will move it.


557
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.884
That's terrific.

558
00:43:08.453 --> 00:43:11.251
We just got another town car.

559
00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:14.054
- Please make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.


560
00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:16.887
We're gonna lay here together.

561
00:43:26.638 --> 00:43:28.265
Thank you.

562
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:30.641
To Fat Cobra...

563
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:33.775
...in the flesh.

564
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.357
So tell me...

565
00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:56.465
...how many kills do you have?
- Kills?


566
00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:01.369
- Six.
- Six only?


567
00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:03.604
Since christmas.

568
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.869
People think we are insane.

569
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:13.709
They don't know the joy of holding a man's
beating heart in the palm of your hand.


570
00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:16.115
That's a good feeling.

571
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:22.691
- Let's take a walk.
- No, I walked too much today.


572
00:44:23.128 --> 00:44:27.258
Besides, I have a little pain
here behind my ankle.


573
00:44:27.432 --> 00:44:30.026
- Let me take a look at it.
- What do you mean?


574
00:44:30.702 --> 00:44:32.693
I'm a foot person.

575
00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:34.736
Just like me.

576
00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:38.833
All right, tell me something here.
Is it tender right there?


577
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.375
Yes!

578
00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:45.006
You have plantar fasciitis
in the heel.


579
00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:46.673
You should go soak that.

580
00:44:47.652 --> 00:44:49.347
Did you say "soak"?

581
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.690
I didn't mean soak the whole body.

582
00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:38.458
I'll grab a bathing suit.
Which would you like, american or french?


583
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:40.799
Soviet.

584
00:45:42.507 --> 00:45:44.600
I'll be right back.

585
00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:51.414
I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

586
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:54.814
That's great! Great, Jerry.
You're getting into character.


587
00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.546
I gotta get his client list
and see what he's smuggling...


588
00:45:57.722 --> 00:46:00.486
...and where it's traveling,
so keep him looking the other way!


589
00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:03.991
Did you hear what he's calling me?
Did you hear that? Fat Cobra!


590
00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:10.534
Listen...

591
00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:12.294
...i have to talk to you.

592
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:13.937
Hey!

593
00:46:16.174 --> 00:46:18.335
I can't go in with you,
but I'm happy to watch.


594
00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:21.910
- Why?
- I have, like, a childhood problem.


595
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.776
A disease. Sort of rare.

596
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:30.110
I'm not waterproof.
My skin will let in water.


597
00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:34.019
So I can't be in a situation where...

598
00:46:34.192 --> 00:46:37.320
...i submerse myself.

599
00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:40.953
So as a child, I couldn't do anything.
I couldn't even play with a hose.


600
00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:43.859
- You know, the slip 'n slides?
- Yes.


601
00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:45.559
I couldn't have that.

602
00:46:45.737 --> 00:46:48.137
And even snow cones.

603
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.773
Anyway, if I got in there and
it happened, then I could really get sick.


604
00:46:53.278 --> 00:46:56.406
What would happen is the water
goes all the way through the skin...


605
00:46:56.581 --> 00:47:00.984
...because I got what they...
well, they call "wet bone."


606
00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:06.319
I'm curious to know more
about wet bone.


607
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.352
Well, the money's all there, huh?

608
00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:15.522
You okay?
You're looking a little dizzy.


609
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.306
I'm married.

610
00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:26.068
- You're married?
- Yeah, I'm married.


611
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:29.379
Well, actually, we're separated.

612
00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:33.650
Okay, I killed her.

613
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:39.050
Well, my wife is still
very much alive.


614
00:47:39.824 --> 00:47:42.156
It's very nice to have a wife.

615
00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:45.690
But as a man, there are certain things
i can only do with other men.


616
00:47:46.464 --> 00:47:49.194
- Like golf?
- No, I'm not gay.


617
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:54.430
It's just occasionally I need the company
of a man.


618
00:47:54.973 --> 00:47:58.465
Just because I'm big,
it doesn't mean I'm easy.


619
00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:06.411
Wow!

620
00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:09.781
I don't want to interrupt.
Just wanted to tell you the money's good...


621
00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:13.219
...i talked to the supplier,
and he'll be there sunday.


622
00:48:14.092 --> 00:48:16.492
- Would you guys like me to go?
- No, we're done.


623
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:19.687
That was a good soak,
and I thank you very much.


624
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.572
The international operator.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!


625
00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:42.014
Could you hold, please?

626
00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:43.813
Excuse me!

627
00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:46.787
Peyser is on line one.

628
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:50.189
He's crazed. Something about
Steve Tobias and the Fat Cobra.


629
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:52.261
- Mr. Peyser?
- It's dr. Peyser!


630
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.591
You are in trouble.
Where you calling from?


631
00:48:54.766 --> 00:48:56.859
How can I be in trouble?
I didn't do anything.


632
00:48:57.035 --> 00:49:00.129
Steve Tobias gave me
that fissile waste!


633
00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:02.636
- Did you say Steve Tobias?
- Yes.


634
00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:05.967
- He's one of you guys, right?
- Mr. Peyser, this is the fbi.


635
00:49:06.144 --> 00:49:09.272
Tobias was with the cia, but he was let go.
He's a rogue agent.


636
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:11.176
- What does that mean?
- He went bad.


637
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:14.614
He's mentally unstable and dangerous.
What's this about the Fat Cobra?


638
00:49:14.786 --> 00:49:16.583
Please, I'm innocent.

639
00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:20.986
Why don't you come tonight. We'll be
in chicago at 8:00 at the marriott marquis.


640
00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:24.026
We're in the eleanor roosevelt
function room.


641
00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:27.323
There's no eleanor roosevelt function room
at that hotel.


642
00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:29.898
One of the roosevelts!

643
00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:34.530
- Who you talking to?
- Just an operator. Nobody.


644
00:49:38.076 --> 00:49:39.873
Are you lying to me, Jer?

645
00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:42.342
That will upset me.
You don't want to upset me.


646
00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:43.707
No, no. No, I don't.

647
00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:48.151
Good. So let's get going, huh?

648
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:53.154
Last one to the plane's gonna take

649
00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:56.116
Look, I'm used to dealing
with dr. Peyser, okay?


650
00:49:56.294 --> 00:49:59.491
- What do you have to do with this affair?
- Nothing. I'm the bride.


651
00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:03.225
Congratulations. Now, what do you want
me to do with the spray of freesia?


652
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:06.666
Hey, buddy, I'll show you where you
can put the spray of freesia, okay?


653
00:50:06.838 --> 00:50:08.066
Okay.

654
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:11.868
Gloria, what did you do with the
table-card seat-assignment thingies?


655
00:50:12.043 --> 00:50:14.102
What thingies? 
I'm a little muzzy.

656
00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:17.406
I think the devil's playing drums
in my head.


657
00:50:17.782 --> 00:50:19.807
That better be my dad.

658
00:50:20.518 --> 00:50:22.452
- "Streisand. Private."
- That would be me.


659
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.178
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


660
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:27.017
Where are you?
Melissa's just really freaking out.


661
00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.989
And her dad's not even here,
and he planned the whole thing.


662
00:50:30.161 --> 00:50:32.721
No, he's right here. He's fine.

663
00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.923
Listen, buddy, I wanna give you
the heads up on something.


664
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.933
We've changed the location
of the rehearsal dinner.


665
00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:41.162
We're gonna meet you
at the signature room...


666
00:50:41.339 --> 00:50:43.500
...at the hancock tower instead
of the marriott.


667
00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:45.706
You moved the rehearsal dinner?

668
00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:49.438
Well, the hancock tower owed us
a favor and they'll set us up really nice.


669
00:50:49.614 --> 00:50:53.345
So if you get there before I do and
there's any kind of problem, ask for artie.


670
00:50:53.518 --> 00:50:56.783
Reference the alabaster incident.
He'll know what you're talking about.


671
00:50:56.954 --> 00:50:58.182
Oh, my god.

672
00:50:58.356 --> 00:51:00.916
I'm sorry about this, buddy,
but it's important.


673
00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:02.286
And this isn't?

674
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.554
You gotta trust me on this, all right?
Have I ever let you down?


675
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.288
Well, as a matter of fact...

676
00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:09.262
don't answer that.

677
00:51:10.334 --> 00:51:12.461
I'll make it up to you.

678
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:18.534
What was the name of that song you guys
sang at that karaoke club on your first date?


679
00:51:19.177 --> 00:51:20.644
What?

680
00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:25.070
"Get down tonight"
by kc and the sunshine band. Why?


681
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:27.581
I was just curious.

682
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:30.915
- I'll talk to you later.
- Super.


683
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.214
Oh, my god.

684
00:51:38.896 --> 00:51:41.694
So you went and called the fbi.

685
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.397
I know all about you now.

686
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:47.504
You're a liar.
You lie about everything.


687
00:51:47.672 --> 00:51:50.436
I did not lie to you, Jer.

688
00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:52.735
I do not lie to family.

689
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:56.607
Don't call me family!
We're not family!


690
00:52:01.953 --> 00:52:03.853
- He did what?
- It's fine.


691
00:52:04.021 --> 00:52:05.886
He switches things around sometimes...

692
00:52:06.057 --> 00:52:07.854
how could he just go and do that?

693
00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:10.118
Because he's Steve Tobias.

694
00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:12.854
And Steve Tobias is
an emotional fascist.


695
00:52:13.331 --> 00:52:15.663
But I'd like to say something.

696
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:18.063
Just because I hate Marc's father...

697
00:52:18.236 --> 00:52:21.933
...it's not going to be uncomfortable here
at the wedding.


698
00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:24.006
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, mom.


699
00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:27.667
Hi, honey.
I'm so happy to be here.


700
00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.075
And I'm so proud of you.

701
00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:35.781
And finally,
the daughter I never had.


702
00:52:37.922 --> 00:52:40.015
You complete me.

703
00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:43.520
You know, Marc was supposed
to be a girl.


704
00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:47.895
And this is popo.

705
00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:49.589
- Popo?
- Hi.


706
00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:51.860
He's doing the ceremony
with the rabbi.


707
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:54.267
He is?

708
00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:06.178
The signature room?

709
00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:10.178
What happened to the marriott?
It's closer to the ground.


710
00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:12.049
Come on.

711
00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.016
The signature room.

712
00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:18.923
I've always wanted to come here,
but Jerry gets vertigo.


713
00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:21.894
Thank you so much for the surprise.

714
00:53:22.066 --> 00:53:23.658
This would be Steve's doing.

715
00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:24.994
He doesn't have a soul...

716
00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:28.730
...so he has to compensate
by making extravagant gestures.


717
00:53:28.906 --> 00:53:31.340
Well, marriage is difficult.

718
00:53:32.643 --> 00:53:36.079
But we had fantastic sex.

719
00:53:36.247 --> 00:53:39.114
Fantastic, angry...

720
00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:44.915
...crazy, crazy, crazy sex.

721
00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:50.326
Hey.

722
00:53:50.494 --> 00:53:53.793
- We're here.
- Oh, my god.


723
00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:57.259
Your dad must sell a lot of toner.

724
00:53:57.435 --> 00:54:00.802
Oh, hi. I'm so happy you could come.

725
00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:06.299
Roosevelt. This is it!

726
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:17.110
Freeze!

727
00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:18.977
Hey.

728
00:54:20.291 --> 00:54:22.054
What's up?

729
00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:24.253
Got Carlucci!
He found them.


730
00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:26.487
They're over at the hancock tower.

731
00:54:26.664 --> 00:54:28.529
Peyser set us up. 
Son of a bitch!

732
00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:32.726
I want the whole unit regrouped downstairs
in two minutes. Let's go!


733
00:54:33.304 --> 00:54:35.033
You're doing great, Jer.

734
00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:38.175
First an airplane, now one
of the tallest buildings in the world.


735
00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:40.173
I'm proud of you.

736
00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:42.636
Has the elevator stopped?

737
00:54:43.114 --> 00:54:44.513
It's too high.

738
00:54:44.682 --> 00:54:46.479
Here, please.

739
00:54:46.817 --> 00:54:48.478
Water.

740
00:54:50.988 --> 00:54:53.855
- What's this?
- My collapsible cup.


741
00:54:54.258 --> 00:54:56.453
You're a piece of work, Jer.

742
00:54:57.161 --> 00:55:01.029
If it's tap water,
let it run at least 20 seconds.


743
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:05.930
Melissa! Melissa!

744
00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:07.832
Daddy, where the hell
have you been?


745
00:55:08.005 --> 00:55:11.099
First you plan this whole thing
without me, and then you disappear.


746
00:55:11.275 --> 00:55:13.835
- I don't know anyone here!
- I'm sorry. I went to france.


747
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:15.672
It wasn't my fault.

748
00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:18.314
I just want everything to be wonderful,
that's all.


749
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:21.113
Are you having a good time, at least?

750
00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:23.378
I'm trying to.

751
00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:25.449
No.

752
00:55:25.623 --> 00:55:28.114
- No?
- We have to do shots!


753
00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:31.121
Shots, shots, shots!

754
00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:33.126
- Are you okay?
- No!


755
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:36.425
The fbi came to the house!

756
00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:41.531
It's Steve. I talked to them.
He's a rogue agent. He's unstable!


757
00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.332
- Who?
- Steve.


758
00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:46.237
- He's a rogue xerox agent?
- No, no! Cia.


759
00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.145
I'm lucky to be here.
I had a roofie. I was on a plane!


760
00:55:50.314 --> 00:55:53.715
- That's right, you flew!
- I did. I did fly!


761
00:55:53.884 --> 00:55:55.249
Isn't that something?

762
00:55:55.653 --> 00:55:58.816
- The thing is, you gotta go private.
- Yeah.


763
00:56:35.693 --> 00:56:37.661
Oh, god.

764
00:56:38.062 --> 00:56:42.021
- Oh, there you are.
- Judy, judy, judy. How are you?


765
00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:43.757
You look great.

766
00:56:44.368 --> 00:56:45.926
It's the work at the ashram.

767
00:56:46.904 --> 00:56:48.895
- And the therapy.
- Really?


768
00:56:49.073 --> 00:56:52.270
And several powerful prescription drugs.

769
00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:54.934
I'm kidding about the drugs. Or am i?

770
00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:58.479
At any rate, let's give ourselves permission
to be honest with each other...


771
00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:00.583
...so we can have some closure
this weekend.


772
00:57:00.885 --> 00:57:01.874
Let's not.

773
00:57:02.052 --> 00:57:06.250
Why do you enjoy moving rehearsal
dinners and having everyone hate you?


774
00:57:06.991 --> 00:57:09.357
Another question. 
On your birthday...

775
00:57:09.527 --> 00:57:14.226
...why do you always end up in the bathtub
in the fetal position clutching a firearm?


776
00:57:14.398 --> 00:57:15.660
And one more.

777
00:57:16.367 --> 00:57:19.666
Why did you always weep like a little girl
during orgasm?


778
00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:25.437
Answer to all of the above:
Fear of intimacy.


779
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:28.737
- Judy.
- You're heading for a crash, Steve Tobias.


780
00:57:28.913 --> 00:57:32.076
Into a mountain called
self-awareness.


781
00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:35.412
You have been running away
from yourself your whole life.


782
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:37.417
No, i've been running away from you!

783
00:57:37.588 --> 00:57:40.614
Because I'm the only one
that's got your number!


784
00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:48.824
Let's go! Hurry.

785
00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:56.101
Well, you're here, and you seem fine.

786
00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:58.104
I seem fine? Have you heard nothing?

787
00:57:58.275 --> 00:58:00.675
What, am I not talking english?
This is fine to you?


788
00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:03.074
- Katherine, hi. How are you?
- Hi, Steve.


789
00:58:03.247 --> 00:58:05.408
- Get away from me.
- I brought you your water.


790
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:07.448
- Okay, thanks.
- Come on, let's go.


791
00:58:07.618 --> 00:58:08.915
No, l...

792
00:58:09.086 --> 00:58:11.247
get help. Get some help!

793
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:13.879
Let's do it.

794
00:58:14.058 --> 00:58:16.356
What the hell is this?
I said, signature room!


795
00:58:16.527 --> 00:58:18.392
I did, I swear.

796
00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:19.824
Top floor.

797
00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:23.228
- Look, there are only three buttons.
- Signature room.


798
00:58:30.274 --> 00:58:33.141
Is this not a beautiful evening?

799
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:44.380
Well, I stand before you this evening
as a very, very happy man.


800
00:58:44.555 --> 00:58:47.581
Not only has the almighty seen fit...

801
00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:51.125
...to provide me
with a beautiful new daughter...


802
00:58:53.097 --> 00:58:57.659
...but I am blessed with this man
here on my left.


803
00:58:57.835 --> 00:59:01.703
A man who's given
so much to so many.

804
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:06.172
A man who has a taste
for adventure...


805
00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:08.504
- this is your father, right?
- My dad?


806
00:59:08.679 --> 00:59:11.443
...who is willing to try new things.

807
00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.113
Damn it!

808
00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.983
Let's take the stairs! Now!

809
00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:22.554
But most importantly...

810
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:27.060
...a man who I know will always be close
in my heart.


811
00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:31.432
- A man who l...
- he is mentally ill!


812
00:59:32.503 --> 00:59:35.199
No, I mean it, he's dangerous!

813
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.100
Listen, he gave me a roofie!

814
00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:42.811
He took me on a plane to france!

815
00:59:43.514 --> 00:59:46.278
Yeah, I took him to france!

816
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:52.350
Stop it! He's a rogue agent!
He works for the other side!


817
00:59:52.523 --> 00:59:54.650
Call somebody!

818
00:59:57.227 --> 01:00:00.492
Well, enough of the hearts and flowers,
huh?


819
01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:03.030
We're here to have a good time,
right?


820
01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:07.971
Here we go!

821
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.270
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
kc and the sunshine band!


822
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.280
Oh, my god.

823
01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.361
Honey, this is the song we sang
on our first date!


824
01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:39.524
I know.

825
01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:05.491
You are one slick bastard.

826
01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.257
Look, leave me alone!

827
01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.335
Find somebody else to torture.

828
01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:16.371
- Okay.
- Thank you!


829
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.804
Dr. Peyser.

830
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.345
Agent hutchins, thank god!

831
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:27.642
- You're under arrest.
- What are you doing?


832
01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.649
Stay where you are, dr. Peyser.

833
01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:32.521
Or should we call you Fat Cobra?

834
01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:34.356
I'm not the Fat Cobra!

835
01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.152
If necessary, shoot to kill.

836
01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.886
You got the wrong guy! I'm...

837
01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.593
there's 100 guns pointing at my head!

838
01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:44.598
- They think you're the Fat Cobra.
- Because you told them!


839
01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:48.727
- No, I didn't. You told them!
- No, I didn't!


840
01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:55.645
Meliss?

841
01:01:55.813 --> 01:02:00.079
Okay. It may not be the best time
to tell you this...


842
01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:04.744
...but a couple of years ago,
i slept with Marc.


843
01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:08.585
And I think I'm
still in love with him.

844
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.260
What?

845
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.704
Yesterday, I was a respected man
in my community.


846
01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.741
Today, they want to kill me!

847
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.139
My life is ruined!

848
01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:33.477
Jerry, I am sorry I ruined your life,
but you know what?


849
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:35.743
This case is my life.

850
01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.848
I'm on a roof.

851
01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:39.886
I don't do roofs.

852
01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.752
Peyser, down on the ground!

853
01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:45.124
On the ground now!

854
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.289
Well, buddy, I guess this is it, huh?
We tried.


855
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.228
- Give me a hug.
- What, are you crazy?


856
01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:54.461
- Fine, I'll hug you.
- No! What are you...?


857
01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.469
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

858
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.440
What are you doing?!
Holy mother of god!


859
01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:05.970
Now, you're gonna feel a slight jerk.

860
01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:11.684
- You're so much more than a slight jerk!
- That's not very nice.


861
01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:16.190
Jerry, listen to me. I need you
to keep your weight centered!


862
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.487
My weight's fine!

863
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.765
- Help!
- We're fine!


864
01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:26.096
- Help!
- Have a good night!


865
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.638
Get control! Get control, you schmuck!

866
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.902
- You're not exactly helping things, Jer.
- Helping how?


867
01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:36.238
- Unwrap your legs.
- What?


868
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.278
Unwrap your legs!

869
01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:39.813
- All right!
- Thank you.


870
01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:43.783
I guess I forgot to take parachute etiquette
when I went to medical school!


871
01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:46.821
- This isn't fun.
- You gotta stop and smell those roses.


872
01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.623
Don't ever use that expression again!
Ever!


873
01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:01.162
We're about to get impaled by that!

874
01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:05.734
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. I've always hated it.


875
01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:11.239
- Jer?
- Hold on to me! I'll hold on to you!


876
01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:14.851
It's okay. We're down. Easy, Jer.

877
01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.310
Get off me!

878
01:04:22.793 --> 01:04:24.385
I'm choking!

879
01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.689
- All right. We're safe and sound.
- Unbuckle it. Quick.


880
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.458
- We're neither!
- We are.


881
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:35.363
- Okay, pal, let's get the hell out of here.
- No, no. I am done!


882
01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.439
I'm finished with you! I mean it!

883
01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:38.930
What do you mean?

884
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:42.374
When I thought I was gonna die,
you know what image is in my head?


885
01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:44.072
No.

886
01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.614
I'm thinking of that look
my daughter gave me up there.


887
01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:51.242
I've given her these things she doesn't
want, and the one time she needs me...


888
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.286
...where am i? I'm with you!

889
01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:56.221
Something you should work on, Jer.

890
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:59.021
- What did you say?
- I said...


891
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.459
i have to work on that?

892
01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:06.466
The worst father in the universe is telling
me I gotta work on something?


893
01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:11.198
Do you know in the last three months I have
spent almost every day with your kid?


894
01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.866
Have you seen him even once?

895
01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:18.476
Were you even there for conception?
I bet you mailed your sperm in.


896
01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:22.315
I may be bad, granted,
but you're worse!


897
01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:25.819
Way worse! And you know I'm right!

898
01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:33.922
You're way off course.
What is he doing here?


899
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.394
My least favorite person.

900
01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.590
You wanna do something about it,
fanny boy?


901
01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:39.998
- I do. I really do.
- Let's go.


902
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.297
Come on. Bring it on.
You wanna fight me?


903
01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:46.499
Three rounds. Let's do it the right way.
He'll referee, we'll...


904
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.704
it was before I even met you.

905
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.111
It doesn't bother me that you went out
with someone before you met me.


906
01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.547
- I went out with other guys!
- But that's not even...


907
01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.552
- you went out with other guys? Who?
- I've told you about them.


908
01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:02.021
And that's the thing. You weren't
as honest with me as I was with you.


909
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:05.389
And by the way, can you just tell me
what your dad really does?


910
01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:09.760
Because he's got a few too many prada
and gucci outfits to be a xerox salesman.


911
01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:13.097
- I can't say.
- What?


912
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:17.602
I mean, I really...
I'm not allowed to say.


913
01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:19.674
He made me vow.

914
01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.545
And I gave him my word.

915
01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.204
How good is your word?

916
01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:30.316
Okay. I just think you're feeling
a little nervous about the wedding.


917
01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:34.647
Don't tell me what I'm feeling!
My father does that.


918
01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:11.359
- So, what are you doing?
- Just confirming.


919
01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.425
Cherkasov's got her in position
five miles offshore.


920
01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:18.591
Thibodoux's guy is en route, and they're
both set for a noon exchange time.


921
01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:22.329
I guess I can squeeze it in between
the "i dos" and the appetizers.


922
01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:28.543
Unless you think I'm ready
to take the lead.


923
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.170
Excuse me.

924
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:35.682
That's what I thought.
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.


925
01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:38.320
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

926
01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:06.715
Push everything back.

927
01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:08.043
Meaning what?

928
01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:11.244
The whole exchange. Cherkasov,
thibodoux, the money, everything.


929
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.356
Put it off until tomorrow
when the kids are on their honeymoon.


930
01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.958
I thought you were gonna
juggle both. You always do.


931
01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.391
I am tired of juggling.

932
01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:21.963
Cherkasov and thibodoux
are not gonna like this.


933
01:08:22.132 --> 01:08:25.568
- Well, they can kiss my ass.
- Fair enough.


934
01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:27.965
Did you get the tuxedos
from the dry cleaners?


935
01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.605
I sure did.

936
01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:33.436
- What about the pictures?
- Jacket pocket. Anything else?


937
01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.473
You look very nice this evening.

938
01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.879
Thank you.

939
01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.163
What are you doing?

940
01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.596
I'm just waiting for you,
mr. Bright eyes.


941
01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.969
- You dressed me?
- Yes, I did.


942
01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.273
So, Jer, we gotta talk.

943
01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:08.138
I know we've had our differences, but our
son and daughter are gonna be married.


944
01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:11.439
And whether we like it or not,
we're stuck with each other.


945
01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:13.515
Yeah.

946
01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:16.709
So you knocked some sense
into me, father-wise...


947
01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:21.084
...and I'm gonna be changing my lifestyle.
No more shenanigans.


948
01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:24.150
And I'm not working today.

949
01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.352
Does the fbi know about this?

950
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.824
It won't be a problem.

951
01:09:27.998 --> 01:09:32.697
This wedding is gonna be as normal
as butter on mashed potatoes.


952
01:09:32.869 --> 01:09:34.564
Come on, let's go.

953
01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:52.345
Freeze!

954
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:57.956
Like butter on mashed potatoes, huh?
That lasted about 10 minutes.


955
01:09:58.128 --> 01:10:00.153
Jer, just relax.

956
01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.225
Hutchins...

957
01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:08.060
...do you have kids?
- I have a jack russell terrier.


958
01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:11.230
Well, then you'll understand.
You gotta give me two hours.


959
01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:15.367
- You're kidding me!
- This is my son's wedding.


960
01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.738
You can do anything you want
to me afterwards.


961
01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:20.280
You can take me out back,
shoot me, be a hero.


962
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.714
But let me see my boy get married.

963
01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:31.218
- Or...
- hey! Hey! Hey!


964
01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:35.360
Well, maybe you ought
to just see this.


965
01:10:37.367 --> 01:10:38.857
What?

966
01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:44.733
Where'd you get...?

967
01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:48.605
- This was in college, man. I was pledging.
- Wow.


968
01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.405
- Stand down!
- That's a big pair of heels.


969
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.608
Hutch, thanks so much.

970
01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.275
Yeah, thank you.

971
01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:00.122
We'll send out some cake later.

972
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.583
Yeah, we'll be right here!

973
01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:09.091
- That was fun!
- Yeah. Blackmail. It's terrific.


974
01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.634
- Jerry!
- Uncle ben!


975
01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.063
- Mazel tov.
- Thanks.


976
01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:15.204
- Where's Marc and Melissa?
- Where are they?


977
01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:17.397
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Where are they?


978
01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:19.166
- I don't know.
- Ben, I'm asking you.


979
01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:20.809
- I'm asking you.
- I'm asking you.


980
01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:23.741
All right, stop!
We're turning into abbott and costello.


981
01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:25.847
I'm sure they're here.

982
01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.505
- Dr. Peyser.
- Hi, rabbi.


983
01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:31.586
We're already behind schedule, and I do
have two other ceremonies this afternoon.


984
01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:35.213
- And that buddhist monk...
- that was not my idea.


985
01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:37.155
- What's wrong with him?
- He's an idiot.


986
01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:40.922
- Okay. Well, let me talk to him.
- Thank you.


987
01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.122
I don't know one person here!
Not one person.


988
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.927
That's right,
because it's not an arms convention.


989
01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:48.127
Talk to these guys.

990
01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:50.100
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.


991
01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:51.672
Hi, who are you?

992
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.674
- Marc's frat brothers. Who are you?
- I'm Marc's dad.


993
01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:57.074
- Seriously?
- Yeah.


994
01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.674
- Marc never mentioned he had a dad.
- Like, not ever.


995
01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.511
Well, I'm traveling a lot.

996
01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:04.915
I just assumed that you were dead
or in jail.


997
01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.214
Me too.

998
01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.949
Well, fuck you very much
and have another beer.


999
01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.149
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.


1000
01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.954
Mr. Monk...

1001
01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:15.996
...if you two can't work this out,
the planet is doomed.


1002
01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.895
What can I do? 
Just talk to her.

1003
01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.329
- Dr. Peyser.
- Hi.


1004
01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.494
- Gloria, from before.
- Yeah, I know. Hi, gloria.


1005
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.402
- Have you seen Melissa?
- No, where is she?


1006
01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:27.806
I'm a little worried.

1007
01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:32.038
I got really wasted last night, and I did this
my best friend's wedding thing...


1008
01:12:32.215 --> 01:12:34.080
...and told her I dated Marc
one time.


1009
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:37.549
- You what?
- I think she may have bolted.


1010
01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:47.226
So, I thought you'd like
to know the wedding is off.


1011
01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:50.366
- Why? What happened?
- Marc and Melissa have vanished.


1012
01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:54.069
Jerry, calm down.
It's all gonna be all right.


1013
01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:00.734
Melissa. Melissa!

1014
01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.641
Hey! I'll be right back.

1015
01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:09.409
Melissa!

1016
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.823
Melissa...

1017
01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:22.360
...i know you're a little stressed out.
Well, so am i.


1018
01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:25.626
You know, it's a big day and,
you know, you're confused.


1019
01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:28.566
I was confused on the day
i got married.


1020
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.035
Obviously.

1021
01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:33.107
I've never seen Marc happier,
and I know it's because of you.


1022
01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:36.439
And I get down on my knees,
and I thank that big man up there...


1023
01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.103
...for you coming into his life.

1024
01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:40.875
And to tell you that the second
i saw you, I knew...


1025
01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:44.281
...you're the best girl in the world.

1026
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.747
Hi, Steve.

1027
01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.252
Oh, my god.

1028
01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.766
What are you doing in that dress?

1029
01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.466
I won't be the bridesmaid anymore.
Do you understand?


1030
01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.975
No! No, not really. No.

1031
01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:11.870
"I taught you.
When you're ready, take the lead."


1032
01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:14.141
Well, I'm ready,
and I'm taking the lead.


1033
01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.945
I don't wanna end up like you, Steve.
No personal life...


1034
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.348
...a family that hates you.

1035
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.319
I choose happiness!
It's really a breakthrough for me.


1036
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.981
Now, where's the money?

1037
01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:27.091
It's in a case in the warehouse.

1038
01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:29.891
The case in the warehouse is empty.

1039
01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:31.761
We want the money.

1040
01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:33.161
We?

1041
01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:56.325
Jesus christ.

1042
01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:58.784
Oh, god.

1043
01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.289
What a lovely setting.

1044
01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:07.300
- I see your touch in the decor, no?
- I worked with the designer a little.


1045
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.495
Why, it's wonderful.

1046
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:15.633
I was on my way here, excited about my
submarine, and then I realized something.


1047
01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:18.943
Do you want to know what it was
that I realized?


1048
01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:22.677
- Sure.
- I was more excited to see you.


1049
01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:26.578
- I cannot get you out of my mind.
- Okay.


1050
01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.782
I am attracted to you physically,
which for me is very strange...


1051
01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.723
...because I find homosexuality
disgusting!


1052
01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.863
This is a big subject.

1053
01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:40.869
And, you know, the wedding,
so I actually have to find my family.


1054
01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.028
I'll talk to you later.

1055
01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:46.375
- I have them.
- You what?


1056
01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:51.077
What are you doing in that?

1057
01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:53.044
Steven,
i see you have met my partner.


1058
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.382
Yeah, you make a lovely couple.

1059
01:15:57.687 --> 01:16:00.554
- So where's cherkasov?
- Dead.


1060
01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:03.182
What about Olga?

1061
01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:14.761
- Steven Tobias, you son of a bitch!
- Lf we don't die, I'm gonna kill you, dad!


1062
01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.529
- You suck!
- She's wearing my dress!


1063
01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.071
Quiet!

1064
01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:21.867
If I give you the money...

1065
01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.974
...will you leave everybody here
unharmed?


1066
01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:26.610
Of course.

1067
01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:33.752
Hi. Since we can't find the bride and the
groom, we're just gonna open up the bar.


1068
01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:37.188
So everybody have a cocktail!

1069
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.261
That would've made a great gift.

1070
01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:50.934
Now get out.

1071
01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:01.116
Are you coming, sweet cobra?

1072
01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.748
- Daddy, this is weird.
- Where you going, Jerry?


1073
01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:12.827
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1074
01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:21.265
Can I talk to you alone for one second?
It's about us.


1075
01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:24.270
- We don't have time to dilly-dally.
- Pull around the boat.


1076
01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:28.835
What is it, darling?

1077
01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.012
What am I to you, exactly?
A plaything? Or a toy?


1078
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.115
- No, no, no.
- Okay.


1079
01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.682
Let's do this the right way.

1080
01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:38.316
Jean
-Pierre, I love you.

1081
01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.719
And I want you to be...

1082
01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:42.824
...my wife!

1083
01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:48.730
How's the plantar fasciitis now?!

1084
01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.556
Help!

1085
01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:55.396
Jean
-Pierre, come on, we have to go.

1086
01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:58.403
I keep making myself vulnerable.

1087
01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.866
Focus on revenge.

1088
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:08.480
Well, Steve...

1089
01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:10.710
...you have ruined this darling girl's
wedding.


1090
01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:13.685
- No, no. I'm okay.
- No, you're not!


1091
01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:17.383
You will carry the scar of this day
until you die.


1092
01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:20.090
All right, I guess
I am kind of sad.

1093
01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.254
Judy, how is this helpful?

1094
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:25.400
Would both of you please just stop it?!

1095
01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.661
Why don't you give me a break, huh?

1096
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.463
I'll break your neck!

1097
01:18:29.639 --> 01:18:31.800
That's good, Marc.
Express your anger.


1098
01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:33.874
- You want a piece of me?
- You bet I do!


1099
01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.738
Here it goes!

1100
01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.582
Oh, my god!

1101
01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:47.812
What was that?

1102
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.151
The one time my dad showed up
at cub scouts...


1103
01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:53.489
...i earned a merit badge
in covert evasion techniques.


1104
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:03.164
- What happened?
- We broke up.


1105
01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:07.440
What is that?

1106
01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:12.474
That, my friend, is Olga.

1107
01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.411
In Lake Michigan?

1108
01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:17.576
So much for homeland security.

1109
01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:27.595
I'm excited to go on a submarine.

1110
01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:31.594
What was your name again?

1111
01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:34.326
It's Angela.

1112
01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.896
Goodbye, Angela.

1113
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.978
- What are you doing?
- Taking preventative measures.


1114
01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.135
To prevent what?

1115
01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.339
May be a torpedo heading towards
the wedding.


1116
01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.608
What?

1117
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.776
- I'm gonna come with you.
- Sorry, buddy. It's a one-man job.


1118
01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.354
You drag me around the world
when I don't want to go.


1119
01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:57.117
The one time I want to, you say no?
It's my family too.


1120
01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.888
- I'm going. You can't stop me.
- Wow, Jer.


1121
01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.531
- Get on.
- On this?


1122
01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:07.591
Okay.

1123
01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.035
What is the plan?

1124
01:20:12.208 --> 01:20:17.043
The juliett-class torpedo has
an acoustic guidance system.


1125
01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:19.579
It tracks whatever's making
the most noise.


1126
01:20:19.749 --> 01:20:23.014
So if he pulls the trigger,
we've gotta divert the torpedo.


1127
01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.219
Towards what?

1128
01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:29.790
Let me rephrase the question.
What does the torpedo wind up hitting?


1129
01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:32.052
- You said you wanted to help.
- Oh, my god.


1130
01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:35.163
That's before I knew the plan!
It's a terrible plan!


1131
01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:05.553
How are you doing?
You doing okay?


1132
01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:11.994
Yeah. You know,
i got a few questions, like...


1133
01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:15.699
...what the hell is happening?

1134
01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:19.030
My father is in the cia.
He works deep undercover.


1135
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.676
I've spent my life hiding that,
but that's the truth.


1136
01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:26.376
I dated a few skanky girls before I met you.
I don't really like being a lawyer.


1137
01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.779
Played with legos until I was 17...

1138
01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:32.944
...and I go to a colorist because
I'm prematurely gray. It's a rinse.


1139
01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.455
Really?

1140
01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:39.060
I don't want to hide anything
from you anymore, because I don't care!


1141
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:41.093
All I care about is you!

1142
01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.924
- Marc!
- What?


1143
01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:46.294
I love you.

1144
01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:55.808
What are we doing now?

1145
01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:58.469
Why are we turning?

1146
01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:01.211
Make noise!

1147
01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:06.712
Quiet! No noise!

1148
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.921
Hi!

1149
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:17.231
Wait, wait! I've got something...

1150
01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.964
...in my fanny pack!

1151
01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.229
Look!

1152
01:22:24.507 --> 01:22:28.603
- I'll never make a crack again!
- Yeah, because we'll be dead!


1153
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:48.929
Hold on! Hold on!

1154
01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:50.588
I'm gonna throw up!

1155
01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:57.532
It's coming at us!

1156
01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:04.542
Could you stop that, please?

1157
01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.408
Touchy.

1158
01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:16.113
All in all, I'm glad I met you!

1159
01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:18.726
Me too, buddy! I mean it!

1160
01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:20.562
You're the real thing!

1161
01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:24.631
I'm sorry I called you the worst father
in the world! I really didn't mean it!


1162
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.824
Thank you, Jer.

1163
01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:29.732
I'm sure there's at least two
or three guys that are worse!


1164
01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:15.966
That's so awesome!

1165
01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:19.740
Marc? Marc? Honey? Honey?

1166
01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:21.507
Honey, are you okay?

1167
01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:23.242
Baby, are you okay?

1168
01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:27.082
Yeah, but there's cake in my shorts.

1169
01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:38.590
Wait.

1170
01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:47.198
We're gonna go freshen up.

1171
01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.617
Are you guys all right?

1172
01:25:57.786 --> 01:25:59.378
Steve?

1173
01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:03.514
We just wanted to let you know this was
the worst wedding we have ever been to.


1174
01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:06.786
You should thank Jerry.
He put it all together.


1175
01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:09.360
Thanks for coming.

1176
01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:12.992
We gotta do something about this.
Come on.


1177
01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:20.638
I know you all got a lot of questions,
but listen up.


1178
01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:25.109
I am deep cover cia,
case number 3924.


1179
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:27.806
Peter Markell's my sole contact
at the agency.


1180
01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:30.383
All right. Well, we're gonna check that out.

1181
01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:33.282
You know, you almost blew my cover
a few times.


1182
01:26:33.455 --> 01:26:35.047
But I don't want an apology...

1183
01:26:35.224 --> 01:26:38.591
...because I think I got a way
that you can make it up.


1184
01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:44.696
And do you, Melissa, take Marc
to be your wedded husband...


1185
01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:47.961
...to have and to hold
from this day forward...


1186
01:26:48.137 --> 01:26:51.334
...for better or worse,
for richer or poorer...


1187
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.837
...in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?


1188
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.739
I do.

1189
01:26:57.046 --> 01:27:01.142
By the power vested in me
by the federal bureau of investigation...


1190
01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:04.343
...i now pronounce you man and wife.

1191
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.215
You may kiss the bride.

1192
01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:10.582
Yeah.

1193
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.564
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov.


1194
01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:43.149
You know how I run around
and try to save the world?


1195
01:27:43.492 --> 01:27:45.926
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, no. No.


1196
01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:49.496
What I want you to know
is, you are my world, Marc.


1197
01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:51.724
I'm so proud of you.

1198
01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:55.336
Congratulations.

1199
01:28:06.682 --> 01:28:09.515
I know we fought a lot,
but we must have done something right.


1200
01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:11.983
He's a great kid.

1201
01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:14.979
And you're a very good mother.

1202
01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:18.124
Thank you.

1203
01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:20.119
You're welcome.

1204
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.859
And I still hate you.

1205
01:28:26.235 --> 01:28:29.033
But I do have a room back
at the club.


1206
01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.575
I am so sorry about the wedding.

1207
01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:39.179
What are you talking about?
Daddy, don't you realize?


1208
01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:40.337
What?

1209
01:28:40.749 --> 01:28:43.718
This is exactly what I wanted.

1210
01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:46.554
Six people on a beach.

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.121
- Good.
- I love you.


1212
01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:51.987
Thank you.

1213
01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.152
I love you too.

1214
01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.527
Thanks.

1215

Six people on a beach.

1216
01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:09.843
I could have saved a fortune!

1217
01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:13.140
Jer, you're gonna be fine.

1218
01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:18.676
As a matter of fact...

1219
01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:23.814
...the whole family,
they're gonna be just fine.


1220
01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.766
Cobra! Fat Cobra!

1221
01:29:33.936 --> 01:29:36.131
It's all right, darling!

1222
01:29:36.305 --> 01:29:38.273
I forgive you!

1223
01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.306
Call me.

1224
01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:48.177
You know something?
He might actually like prison.


1225
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:50.147
Like it?

1226
01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:53.250
He's gonna love it.

1227
01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:02.511
A little help would be nice!

1228
01:32:03.952 --> 01:32:06.079
Anybody?
