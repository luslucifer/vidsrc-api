J' We are wonder women

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.044
J' Yes we are wonder women

7
00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:42.631
J' We've got that superpower

8
00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:46.969
J' Call us wonder women

9
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:50.806
J' Wonder women

10
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.891
J' Wonder women

11
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:55.978
J' We've got that superpower

12
00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:59.106
J' Call us wonder women

13
00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:23.672
- Give me a report on
the vital signs.


14
00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:25.299
Anesthesia, cortex control to
the second level.


15
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.972
- Respiration levels
are satisfactory.


16
00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:33.515
Heart beat regular.

17
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.188
Blood pressure normal.

18
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.859
Spinal reflexes I'm not sure.

19
00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:17.935
Jesus Christ, it worked.

20
00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:19.894
He's still alive?

21
00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:21.187
Of course he is.

22
00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:22.438
- Do you really think
she can do it?


23
00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:24.233
Hell yeah, she can do anything.

24
00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:26.110
- Do you think she'll be
pleased with us?


25
00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:28.070
- She's gotta be, we
pulled it off.


26
00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:31.573
- Yeah and everything went so
perfect, I can't believe it.


27
00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:33.075
Not quite.

28
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.868
You goofed back there remember.

29
00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:37.496
- It couldn't be helped, I
didn't expect that guard.


30
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.206
Our orders were not to kill,

31
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.749
you could have knocked him out.

32
00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:42.126
Get off my back.

33
00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:44.545
- Now you listen to me, you were

34
00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:46.296
Now the next time that
happens to you-


35
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.630
Here she comes.

36
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.548
Shut up, she'll hear us.

37
00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:49.549
Shh.

38
00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:51.134
Afternoon girls.

39
00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:52.094
Congratulations.

40
00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.268
There's no deterioration, you
are too be commended.


41
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.103
You also realize how important

42
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:02.896
the Paulson operation is to me?

43
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.230
And to all of you?

44
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.024
It must be a complete success.

45
00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:08.277
The key to immortality,

46
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.696
the living brain sustained,

47
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:13.490
transferred into new
and fine origins.


48
00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:17.327
And accepted because of my
anti-rejection serum.


49
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.372
Mr. Paulson's fee will
ensure all our futures.


50
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.667
$10 million.

51
00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:18.222
- Last call,
Japan Airline Flight 26,


52
00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:20.265
last call please, last call.

53
00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:21.642
Last call.

54
00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:23.811
- Japan Airline
Flight 26, last call please.


55
00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:27.314
- Japan
Airline Flight 26.


56
00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:31.026
Mister, where to?

57
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360
Downtown.

58
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.321
It is done, I take you.

59
00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:37.032
Go on, this is my taxi.

60
00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:38.367
Get down, get down.

61
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.370
My name is Lapu Lapu, I am
the number one,


62
00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:44.081
the fittest, the bravest,
tip please.


63
00:09:44.414 --> 00:09:46.291
Look I want is a ride okay.

64
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:47.625
You got it.

65
00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:50.254
Where to in downtown?

66
00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:51.880
Intercontinental Hotel.

67
00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:53.841
- I take you the best
scenic spots.


68
00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:56.510
Sometimes very hard to come in,

69
00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:00.597
it's down but it's alright.

70
00:10:10.274 --> 00:10:11.275
Very pretty city Manila.

71
00:10:11.608 --> 00:10:13.777
Many photo's, you
been here before?


72
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:16.280
- No, is it always
this hot here?


73
00:10:16.613 --> 00:10:17.613
This is not hot.

74
00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:19.199
Very soon much rain.

75
00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:26.248
Nice pitch my friend.

76
00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:29.793
Makes me a lover
not a fighter.


77
00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:34.381
Love a little, fight a
little.


78
00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:35.883
Good for the body.

79
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.231
Thank you very much.

80
00:10:52.357 --> 00:10:53.357
Change.

81
00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:54.609
There's no more.

82
00:10:56.486 --> 00:10:57.486
What's your name?

83
00:10:57.779 --> 00:10:59.114
Mike.

84
00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:05.329
- Paging
Miss Janet Snow.


85
00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:08.498
- You there, listen I'm looking
for man named Lorenzo.


86
00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:10.959
- Oh you must be Mr. Harber, Mr.
Lorenzo is expecting you.


87
00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:13.128
- You bet your sweet ass he is,
where can I find him?


88
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:14.462
Right here.

89
00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:18.133
- When the hell did you get off
snatching my passport?


90
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:23.013
I have here a check for $10,000.

91
00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:24.681
From Lloyds of London.

92
00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:26.683
It's made out to you.

93
00:11:27.017 --> 00:11:28.894
It should buy me five
minutes of your time.


94
00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:33.357
Five minutes, my passport

95
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.067
and the next flight to Melbourne.

96
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.443
- How about five
minutes over a drink,


97
00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:38.111
you look as though you
could use one.


98
00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:50.457
- Gail,
where's my schedule.


99
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:52.960
- You have the
optical regeneration on


100
00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:56.004
Lilian Taylor scheduled for
surgery tomorrow morning.


101
00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:57.338
And also the body bank

102
00:11:57.589 --> 00:11:59.383
has verified the perfect
match for her eyes.


103
00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:03.220
- Immediately upon her arrival,
program her against pain.


104
00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:04.553
Place her in an alpha state,

105
00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:06.598
10 and a half cycles per second.

106
00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:09.017
You may go Gail.

107
00:12:09.351 --> 00:12:10.602
Thank you doctor.

108
00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:12.562
- I've received a cable
ofveflficaflon


109
00:12:12.896 --> 00:12:14.398
from our former paraplegic.

110
00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:18.777
The English Duke.

111
00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:24.491
Completion money is to the extent
of 300,000 pounds sterling


112
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:28.286
will be acquitted into your Swiss
account, as of that date.


113
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.581
Good.

114
00:12:31.915 --> 00:12:33.375
I'm pleased to see that such a
handsome man as the Duke,


115
00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:34.960
can be a man again.

116
00:12:38.422 --> 00:12:41.341
Our South American friends

117
00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:43.135
are quibbling over pennies again.

118
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.680
$500,000 to be exact.

119
00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:49.474
It seems as those their
representative


120
00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:51.435
has expressed his
employers concern


121
00:12:51.768 --> 00:12:53.729
over the nature of
the donor's sex.


122
00:12:54.938 --> 00:12:56.356
If it would help Gregorious,

123
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.859
I would be happy to speak
to his employer.


124
00:12:59.192 --> 00:13:02.029
But you can reassure him that
a liver is a liver


125
00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:03.697
and that lungs are lungs.

126
00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:06.783
Besides today is a happy day

127
00:13:07.117 --> 00:13:09.995
and I don't want to hear
of any problems.


128
00:13:10.954 --> 00:13:12.622
That's what I pay you for.

129
00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:13.956
I know Doctor.

130
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:17.419
However, business is business

131
00:13:17.753 --> 00:13:20.464
and we have one more
matter to discuss.


132
00:13:21.882 --> 00:13:25.594
I think we have a problem, it
concerns the Paulson donor.


133
00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:26.970
It seems as though
Lloyds of London


134
00:13:27.304 --> 00:13:30.057
will be obligated to pay an
insurance policy of $500,000.


135
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.642
For a jai alai player?

136
00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:34.519
The worlds top player.

137
00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:35.896
His salary was extraordinary.

138
00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:39.399
We haven't got much time.

139
00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:41.651
They have to pay off the
policy within 90 days.


140
00:13:43.445 --> 00:13:45.489
- So they have to pay off, it
doesn't concern us.


141
00:13:45.822 --> 00:13:48.575
- If that's so Doctor, we have
nothing to worry about.


142
00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:50.702
However our London people
have informed me


143
00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:52.746
that Lloyds is sending a man.

144
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.374
- Oh, some invincible force,
a superman.


145
00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.251
According to his dossier,

146
00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.253
he's a man that can be
dangerous to us.


147
00:14:01.838 --> 00:14:03.465
- Don't you realize by
now Gregorious,


148
00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:06.468
that no one man is
dangerous to us.


149
00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:07.802
His name is Mike Harber.

150
00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:10.222
Four years service with the CIA,

151
00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:12.224
five year with the
Detective Bureau


152
00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:14.351
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.


153
00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:18.396
You've blown three minutes.

154
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.816
48 hours ago a jai alai player,

155
00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:23.443
Ramone Julio was kidnapped
right here in Manila.


156
00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:26.279
Unless he's found alive,

157
00:14:26.613 --> 00:14:29.449
it's going to cost my company
half a million dollars.


158
00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:30.783
So?

159
00:14:31.034 --> 00:14:34.162
- That kind of pay off is
bad publicity.


160
00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:38.416
It could become a fad like
skyjacking and get out of hand.


161
00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:40.836
I'll tell you one thing,

162
00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:42.169
you've got a hell of a
problem friend.


163
00:14:42.462 --> 00:14:43.713
- Now we need a miracle Mr.
Harber, a miracle.


164
00:14:44.047 --> 00:14:45.298
Miracle's come high.

165
00:14:46.258 --> 00:14:48.593
$10,000 plus all expenses.

166
00:14:48.927 --> 00:14:52.097
And another $15,000 when and if
you find Julio alive.


167
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.766
Ah, you got a piece of paper.

168
00:15:01.314 --> 00:15:03.191
Okay, this is what's gonna work.

169
00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:04.818
$25,000 win, lose or
draw and if I get,


170
00:15:05.152 --> 00:15:07.362
whatshisname back in one piece,

171
00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:10.740
then I'll settle for 130
of your action.


172
00:15:11.074 --> 00:15:13.034
$160,000?

173
00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:14.870
That's impossible.

174
00:15:15.203 --> 00:15:16.203
My passport.

175
00:15:16.454 --> 00:15:17.454
10%?

176
00:15:17.622 --> 00:15:18.874
That's impossible, my passport.

177
00:15:19.207 --> 00:15:20.292
20%?

178
00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:22.961
But I can't go a penny higher.

179
00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:24.504
- No one's asking you to,
it's a deal.


180
00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:26.173
Here lay it out.

181
00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:44.399
- I'm sorry sir, Mr. Paulson
does not allow smoking.


182
00:15:54.826 --> 00:15:55.826
Your attache case sir.

183
00:15:57.412 --> 00:15:58.830
- Are you aware of the
fact young man,


184
00:15:59.164 --> 00:16:00.164
that I am expected.

185
00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:02.500
- Yes sir, it's simply
routine procedure.


186
00:16:02.834 --> 00:16:03.834
May l?

187
00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:08.964
Thank you.

188
00:16:24.898 --> 00:16:26.691
The case is locked.

189
00:16:28.026 --> 00:16:29.486
Arrangements have been
made to open it


190
00:16:29.819 --> 00:16:32.155
only in the presence of Dr. Tsu.

191
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.099
With your permission sir?

192
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.907
Use this one please sir.

193
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.756
Ah, there's one more thing sir.

194
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:40.807
An oral disinfectant.

195
00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:47.063
I'm sorry sir, Mr.
Paulson requires it.


196
00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:52.568
Thank you.

197
00:18:29.814 --> 00:18:32.776
- Mr. Paulson, it is
indeed a pleasure.


198
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:35.319
I've been very
anxious to meet you.


199
00:18:50.168 --> 00:18:52.796
- Mr. Paulson assumes all
arrangements have been made?


200
00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:54.297
Yes of course.

201
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:55.924
Dr. Tsu will be here at any moment

202
00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:59.052
to discuss the details of
the operation.


203
00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:01.846
However there is the slight
matter of a fee.


204
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.180
Yes sir.

205
00:19:03.807 --> 00:19:04.807
Your deposit.

206
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.100
One million dollars.

207
00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:10.855
- That takes care of the first
part of the agreement.


208
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:12.189
Now as for the second.

209
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:23.952
- Mr. Paulson has noted that Dr.
Tsu


210
00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:26.913
was expelled from the
International Medical Association.


211
00:19:27.247 --> 00:19:29.833
- Dr. Tsu is a hundred years
ahead of her time.


212
00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:34.921
And it is characteristic of human
beings to resist progress.


213
00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:36.255
Mr. Paulson has further noted

214
00:19:36.464 --> 00:19:38.091
Dr. Tsu is reported to
have performed


215
00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:40.802
unusual experiments on
her patients.


216
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.179
- Dr. Tsu is an
extraordinary woman.


217
00:19:43.513 --> 00:19:46.307
Her genius and her talent

218
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:49.853
transcends the question of
human morality.


219
00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:54.816
- Mr.
Paulson is concerned


220
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.818
with the outcome of the operation.

221
00:19:57.152 --> 00:19:58.361
Her work is thoroughly documented.

222
00:19:58.695 --> 00:20:01.072
- How are you Mr. Paulson,
how are you?


223
00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:15.920
You must set your mind at ease Mr.
Paulson.


224
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.049
You are a man who's accustomed to
receiving the very best.


225
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:23.553
I'm here to make sure that you get
exactly what you want


226
00:20:23.887 --> 00:20:24.888
and nothing less.

227
00:20:25.221 --> 00:20:26.848
- Mr. Paulson expresses
his appreciation


228
00:20:27.182 --> 00:20:28.766
of your remarkable achievement

229
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.103
and regards you as an
extraordinary woman.


230
00:20:32.437 --> 00:20:35.190
However he finds the terms of the
financial agreement


231
00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:38.151
somewhat unsatisfactory to him.

232
00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:41.154
There are no guarantees
and no recourse.


233
00:20:41.488 --> 00:20:43.448
- I often amuse myself with a
provocative image


234
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:46.451
that death has been
seduced by a woman.


235
00:20:46.784 --> 00:20:48.786
The truth of the matter
is quite simple.


236
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.163
The medical facts.

237
00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:52.999
It is now possible for me to
transplant your brain


238
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:57.003
into the body of a healthy, young,
virile athlete.


239
00:21:04.344 --> 00:21:07.388
- The legal issue, it is
a difficult one.


240
00:21:07.722 --> 00:21:09.557
The outside possibility of
a murder charge.


241
00:21:09.891 --> 00:21:10.891
Murder?

242
00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:12.143
You surprise me.

243
00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:14.854
For a man of your
position and power,


244
00:21:15.188 --> 00:21:17.315
the legality issue is
purely academic.


245
00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:20.985
I'm presenting you with a
probability of immortality.


246
00:21:28.826 --> 00:21:30.036
What remains to be done?

247
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.372
- It's a simple matter
of arithmetic.


248
00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:37.126
50% of all your holdings in
exchange for 100% of eternity.


249
00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:47.011
Oh he's sexy.

250
00:21:47.345 --> 00:21:48.345
Wow.

251
00:21:49.597 --> 00:21:51.975
Sure turns me on.

252
00:21:52.308 --> 00:21:53.434
Turns me on too.

253
00:21:54.894 --> 00:21:57.063
- Well what are we
gonna do about it?


254
00:21:57.397 --> 00:22:00.108
- I'll take the bottom half, you
take the top half.


255
00:22:03.152 --> 00:22:04.152
He's beautiful.

256
00:22:06.322 --> 00:22:07.322
Perfection.

257
00:22:08.241 --> 00:22:10.243
- He doesn't do a thing
for me honey.


258
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880
Hey Vera.

259
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.510
That one really turns me on.

260
00:22:33.182 --> 00:22:36.769
- The Paulson party is due to
arrive late tomorrow.


261
00:22:37.103 --> 00:22:39.230
Now for the last item on the
agenda tomorrow morning,


262
00:22:39.564 --> 00:22:40.982
we have the eye transplant.

263
00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:43.151
Has the proper donor
been selected?


264
00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:44.611
Yes he has Dr. Tsu,

265
00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:46.988
but I strongly advise
a replacement.


266
00:22:47.322 --> 00:22:48.322
May I ask why?

267
00:22:49.532 --> 00:22:51.868
- I think the body bank
made a mistake.


268
00:22:52.201 --> 00:22:54.078
You see he has perfect
eyesight now,


269
00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:55.455
but his medical history

270
00:22:55.788 --> 00:22:58.249
indicates genetic
tolerance to stigmatism.


271
00:22:58.583 --> 00:23:00.668
- Well done, I'm
proud of you Vera.


272
00:23:10.303 --> 00:23:14.140
Perfection is our goal, however
our guarantee stipulates


273
00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:16.768
only the delivery of
perfect eyesight.


274
00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:19.896
We are not responsible for the
normal aging process.


275
00:23:21.272 --> 00:23:24.776
- Perhaps our actress will be
a future customer.


276
00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:26.944
- Laura you make us
sound so greedy.


277
00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:30.031
- You realize we can always find
other donors Dr. Tsu.


278
00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:32.450
Yes we can, but we won't.

279
00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:37.246
Well, shall we make our
rounds girls.


280
00:23:39.499 --> 00:23:41.876
- I might take another look at
our new arrivals.


281
00:23:43.252 --> 00:23:48.132
- Yeah, new arrivals mean
fresh entertainment.


282
00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:52.637
- Yeah, lord knows I could
use a good ball.


283
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.056
Well god knows I'm horny enough.

284
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.308
- Oh you gotta try the new
Argentinian soccer player,


285
00:23:57.642 --> 00:23:58.685
he's incredible. 
- Yeah?

286
00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:00.228
Too late.

287
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:02.271
Just this morning he was
requisitioned for vital organs


288
00:24:02.605 --> 00:24:03.605
and sent to dissection.

289
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:07.901
Fitting.

290
00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:40.309
- I'll bet you get your kicks out
of playing with guns.


291
00:24:40.643 --> 00:24:42.228
I don't play with guns.

292
00:24:42.562 --> 00:24:43.562
I don't like you.

293
00:24:43.762 --> 00:24:44.939
Leaver her alone Laura.

294
00:24:45.273 --> 00:24:46.273
Why should l?

295
00:24:48.234 --> 00:24:50.319
I don't trust her, she's
too emotional.


296
00:24:53.322 --> 00:24:55.116
You all heard what a
certain doctor thinks


297
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.201
about emotions
revealing weaknesses.


298
00:24:58.536 --> 00:25:00.663
- And a big mouth
revealing stupidity.


299
00:25:00.997 --> 00:25:02.999
Well the contessa has spoken.

300
00:25:03.332 --> 00:25:06.627
- Stay out of this Linda, I can
take care of myself.


301
00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:08.963
Hey, I got a great idea.

302
00:25:09.297 --> 00:25:12.008
Why don't you and Vera get
together and try brain sex.


303
00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:14.343
I heard it eliminates
emotional disorders.


304
00:25:15.428 --> 00:25:17.138
- Maybe you'd like to
eliminate me.


305
00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:18.472
I'd love to.

306
00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:21.851
Well what are you waiting for?

307
00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:24.729
The right time, the right place.

308
00:25:28.274 --> 00:25:30.318
Well what have we got here?

309
00:25:31.402 --> 00:25:32.402
It's toy time.

310
00:25:34.363 --> 00:25:37.700
Let me see, I think I'll take,
that one.


311
00:25:38.993 --> 00:25:43.164
Hands off bitch, he's mine.

312
00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:45.958
Tonight only sweetheart.

313
00:25:50.087 --> 00:25:51.087
Vera come here.

314
00:25:52.632 --> 00:25:55.593
Mei-Ling fetch us a
couple of drinks.


315
00:26:04.602 --> 00:26:05.602
She has a point.

316
00:26:07.271 --> 00:26:08.856
You're spending too much
time with him.


317
00:26:11.192 --> 00:26:12.985
- Haven't you ever felt
sorry for them?


318
00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:18.115
A long time ago.

319
00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:19.492
It doesn't pay.

320
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:22.829
Believe me it's not worth it.

321
00:26:24.622 --> 00:26:27.375
Here's to a long time ago.

322
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.304
Now it's my turn.

323
00:28:03.054 --> 00:28:05.640
- Freeze at 18
degrees below centigrade.


324
00:28:05.973 --> 00:28:07.391
Yes Dr. Tsu.

325
00:28:07.725 --> 00:28:08.725
Take him to the recovery room.

326
00:28:08.809 --> 00:28:10.436
Her condition?

327
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.770
Condition normal.

328
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.482
- Good, we're ready
for transplant.


329
00:28:14.815 --> 00:28:15.983
Prepare for the lady's surgery.

330
00:28:20.613 --> 00:28:23.157
- Lie still Tony,
you'll be alright.


331
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:25.493
What have they done with me?

332
00:28:25.826 --> 00:28:26.826
I can't see.

333
00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:28.454
Tony I'm sorry, 
I really tried.

334
00:28:29.497 --> 00:28:31.332
MY eyes, my god my eyes.

335
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:33.583
<i>' MY eyes.</i>

336
00:28:34.877 --> 00:28:38.381
Darling how can I ever thank you,
they're exquisite.


337
00:28:39.382 --> 00:28:41.092
Well we take care in providing

338
00:28:41.425 --> 00:28:44.929
an absolutely perfect selection
of replacement parts.


339
00:28:45.262 --> 00:28:46.597
Such a perfect match.

340
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:48.683
Where did you ever find?

341
00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:52.103
No, I, on second thought I
better not ask.


342
00:28:52.436 --> 00:28:56.148
- Now for six months, you will
take my anti-rejection serum,


343
00:28:56.482 --> 00:29:00.361
in pill form, to prevent the
rejection of your new tissues.


344
00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:01.695
Again thank you Doctor,

345
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:04.740
by the way may I refer my
friends to you?


346
00:29:05.074 --> 00:29:07.952
- You may contact me through Mr.
Gregorious.


347
00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:10.371
- I would be more than
happy to accommodate


348
00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:12.665
your recommendations my dear.

349
00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:15.376
Oh thank you Mr. Gregorious.

350
00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:20.381
- Lorenzo, how do you
know for sure


351
00:29:20.715 --> 00:29:22.383
that these athletes have
been kidnapped?


352
00:29:22.717 --> 00:29:25.636
- Well we don't, simply on
record as missing.


353
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.970
How many?

354
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:29.223
14, all over the world.

355
00:29:29.557 --> 00:29:30.557
And they were the
cream off the top,


356
00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:31.766
the best athletes in the world.

357
00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:34.395
- Yeah well a few things
bother me Lorenzo.


358
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:36.230
Yeah, what's that?

359
00:29:36.564 --> 00:29:37.564
Well number one

360
00:29:37.732 --> 00:29:38.774
there's been no contact
attempts at all.


361
00:29:39.108 --> 00:29:41.569
- That's right, not
even a ransom note.


362
00:29:41.902 --> 00:29:44.238
No bodies and no answers.

363
00:29:44.572 --> 00:29:45.573
That's true

364
00:29:45.906 --> 00:29:47.658
and that leaves us with a whole
lot of unanswered questions.


365
00:29:47.992 --> 00:29:49.118
- Yeah, listen I'd
like to have a look.


366
00:29:49.452 --> 00:29:50.494
You know, where you
found whatshisname,


367
00:29:50.828 --> 00:29:51.828
the jai alai players car.

368
00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:53.080
Yeah sure,

369
00:29:53.414 --> 00:29:54.540
I'll take you there first
thing in the morning.


370
00:29:54.874 --> 00:29:55.874
I might as well tell you,

371
00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.752
the police came up with
a big fat zero.


372
00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:01.839
Ah, Lorenzo.

373
00:30:03.716 --> 00:30:05.718
You got some money I can borrow?

374
00:30:06.052 --> 00:30:07.052
Naturally.

375
00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:09.513
Don't worry I'll pay you back.

376
00:30:50.888 --> 00:30:52.807
Okay Jack, so you busted me.

377
00:30:53.724 --> 00:30:55.392
What do you wanna know?

378
00:30:55.726 --> 00:30:57.144
You American?

379
00:30:57.478 --> 00:31:01.107
- I'm only a human being trying
not get my ass shot off.


380
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.484
They were gonna pull my
number out of a hat,


381
00:31:03.818 --> 00:31:06.654
put a gun in
my hand so I split.

382
00:31:06.987 --> 00:31:09.365
Look, I need some information.

383
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:14.829
The night that car was abandoned
here, you see anything?


384
00:31:15.162 --> 00:31:16.455
Weird trip.

385
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:19.500
I'm sitting here working, you
know doing my thing,


386
00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:21.043
when this big hearse drives up,

387
00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:22.503
followed by this catty limousine

388
00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:24.672
with two chicks in the backseat.

389
00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:26.507
It parked right over there.

390
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:28.259
Then this other car pulled.

391
00:31:28.592 --> 00:31:30.427
See, these two guys get out

392
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:32.721
and they carry a body
over to the hearse.


393
00:31:33.055 --> 00:31:35.724
They put it into a casket
and they just split.


394
00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:37.058
You see anything else?

395
00:31:37.143 --> 00:31:38.143
Who knows man?

396
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.645
I'm blind remember.

397
00:31:45.526 --> 00:31:47.653
Yeah the writing on the
door of the hearse


398
00:31:47.987 --> 00:31:49.738
said "Seaside Chapel."

399
00:31:50.072 --> 00:31:51.073
Who's wired in?

400
00:31:51.407 --> 00:31:53.367
Got this town connected, knows
everybody, everything?


401
00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:54.701
That would be Won Ton Charlie.

402
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.370
How do I find him?

403
00:31:56.704 --> 00:31:57.705
Hey man, I'm no fake.

404
00:31:58.038 --> 00:31:59.038
I've got my interests to protect.

405
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:00.916
I've got a business here.

406
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.543
It's called Faking Enterprises.

407
00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:05.421
I've got 75 dudes work on corners
just like this one.


408
00:32:15.306 --> 00:32:16.390
What do you know about

409
00:32:16.724 --> 00:32:19.226
a Chapel by the Sea or
Seaside Chapel?


410
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.560
Never heard of it.

411
00:32:20.811 --> 00:32:21.811
Well you better check into it,

412
00:32:22.104 --> 00:32:23.564
see if that's where the
hearse came from.


413
00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:26.942
You ever heard of a dude named Won
Ton, Won Ton Charlie?


414
00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:31.989
- Won Ton Charlie, you might try
the City of Death.


415
00:32:38.954 --> 00:32:40.664
City of Death huh?

416
00:32:41.832 --> 00:32:43.167
- That's right Mr.
Mike.


417
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.669
This is the Chinese cemetery,
very spooky,


418
00:32:52.593 --> 00:32:57.473
- You honor my dead with your
presence, Mr. Harber.


419
00:32:58.432 --> 00:32:59.432
They will sleep well tonight.

420
00:33:02.978 --> 00:33:03.979
You Won Ton Charlie?

421
00:33:06.815 --> 00:33:09.610
Euphemism, slang Mr. Harber.

422
00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:12.905
Your presence honors the
family tomb on Won Ton.


423
00:33:14.198 --> 00:33:17.576
Unlike in America, here in
the City of Death


424
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.206
our tombs are chambers of
peace and tranquility.


425
00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:24.208
There are no tears in our temples.

426
00:33:25.542 --> 00:33:29.755
Here we welcome death Mr. Harber.

427
00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:32.132
May I offer you some refreshments?

428
00:33:32.466 --> 00:33:33.801
Some tea perhaps.

429
00:33:34.134 --> 00:33:35.427
Yeah and some information.

430
00:33:35.761 --> 00:33:40.015
- Ah, information, that is a
priceless commodity.


431
00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:43.352
Yeah, just like sex.

432
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:45.771
Since you're so wired into death

433
00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:48.565
what can you tell me about a
Chapel by the Sea.


434
00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:50.025
I know no such Chapel.

435
00:33:51.568 --> 00:33:54.863
- Missing jai alai player,
a hearse, coffin.


436
00:33:55.197 --> 00:33:56.197
Is that a riddle?

437
00:33:57.533 --> 00:33:59.118
- No, no man, it's a
Chinese puzzle.


438
00:34:08.043 --> 00:34:09.378
An offering to your ancestors.

439
00:34:10.754 --> 00:34:13.007
That's one down, two to go.

440
00:34:16.135 --> 00:34:19.054
Crude but straight to the point.

441
00:34:20.764 --> 00:34:24.184
There's a fisherman Nono who might
be of interest to you.


442
00:34:24.518 --> 00:34:25.811
Where can I find him?

443
00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:27.145
At the cockpits.

444
00:34:28.272 --> 00:34:29.690
- And what's the
fisherman selling?


445
00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:31.900
His last catch.

446
00:34:32.234 --> 00:34:33.944
- And who wants a net
full of fish?


447
00:34:34.278 --> 00:34:36.530
- Not fish Mr. Harber,
human bones.


448
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.260
Hey, number one.

449
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.721
Yes.

450
00:37:48.055 --> 00:37:49.306
Everything alright down there.

451
00:37:51.266 --> 00:37:55.062
- Just checking for oil leaks Mr.
Mike.


452
00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:58.732
Looks like someone does not
like you so much huh?


453
00:37:59.066 --> 00:38:01.860
- Yeah it must be my warm and
loving personality.


454
00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:03.194
Come on let's clean up.

455
00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:08.260
- He says he was fishing in the
waters of Freedom Island.


456
00:39:09.386 --> 00:39:11.680
He has two friends, who have
two fishing boats.


457
00:39:12.014 --> 00:39:14.474
They went near the shore, he never
heard of them since.


458
00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:16.852
- Right and what about
these human bones?


459
00:39:17.185 --> 00:39:18.395
Ask him.

460
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:38.290
- He says off the coast of the
Island of a Thousand Women


461
00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:42.127
he was able to pick up nets
of human bones.


462
00:39:44.963 --> 00:39:47.132
Lot's of sharks in the China Sea,
boss.


463
00:39:47.466 --> 00:39:48.466
Lots of sharks.

464
00:39:51.303 --> 00:39:52.929
Can you take us there?

465
00:41:32.487 --> 00:41:36.366
- Lets get out of here, ask him
to meet outside okay.


466
00:42:06.271 --> 00:42:07.731
- Our track star I'm
told has run the mile


467
00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:10.317
in three and a half minutes,
quite remarkable.


468
00:42:11.401 --> 00:42:13.236
Schedule him for a leg transplant.

469
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.238
- Raise the brainwaves cycles
from beta to alpha


470
00:42:15.572 --> 00:42:16.615
and restore him to consciousness.

471
00:42:16.948 --> 00:42:18.241
I want him sent to me tonight.

472
00:42:18.575 --> 00:42:20.368
- That's the second time
this week Vera.


473
00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:22.120
You should show more restraint.

474
00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:25.749
Your old-fashioned way of
sex runs the risk


475
00:42:26.082 --> 00:42:29.252
of involving the emotion and
revealing weakness.


476
00:42:29.586 --> 00:42:30.586
With your permission Doctor,

477
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.340
I think I speak for all of us.

478
00:42:33.673 --> 00:42:35.342
Brain sex may work for you,

479
00:42:35.675 --> 00:42:38.053
but some of us still prefer
physical contact.


480
00:42:38.386 --> 00:42:40.180
- There will come a time
when physical contact


481
00:42:40.514 --> 00:42:42.057
will be unheard of.

482
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.100
Brain sex enables you
to experience


483
00:42:44.434 --> 00:42:46.603
the ultimate in physical sensation

484
00:42:46.937 --> 00:42:49.022
and eliminate emotional disorders.

485
00:42:52.526 --> 00:42:56.112
Increase the cortex control
anesthesia to the fourth level.


486
00:42:56.446 --> 00:42:58.990
- Yes Dr. Tsu, on the
fourth level.


487
00:42:59.324 --> 00:43:01.451
- Attention Dr.
Tsu,


488
00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:04.538
your call to Won Ton is now ready.

489
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:06.665
- I'll take it here on
the PA system.


490
00:43:11.253 --> 00:43:12.379
This is Won Ton.

491
00:43:14.172 --> 00:43:16.216
- It's come to my
attention Won Ton


492
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.802
that your organization suffers
from quality control.


493
00:43:20.095 --> 00:43:22.514
You need to improve the
status of your help.


494
00:43:22.848 --> 00:43:24.599
- Mr. Harber has proven to
be resourceful.


495
00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:27.269
He eliminated six of my men.

496
00:43:27.602 --> 00:43:30.230
With all respect Doctor,
I suggest to you


497
00:43:30.564 --> 00:43:33.900
that Mr. Harber represents a
threat to your security.


498
00:43:34.234 --> 00:43:35.569
The only threat to my security

499
00:43:35.902 --> 00:43:38.405
is an associates
inability to perform.


500
00:43:39.948 --> 00:43:42.993
The fact of Mr. Harber's existence
no longer concerns you.


501
00:43:44.369 --> 00:43:45.745
I shall determine Mr.
Harber's fate.


502
00:43:48.248 --> 00:43:49.248
Good day Won Ton.

503
00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:50.958
As you say Doctor.

504
00:43:54.546 --> 00:43:57.549
- We are ready to surgically
here with the splinter.


505
00:44:08.018 --> 00:44:09.686
Three loso, no ice.

506
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.020
Yes sir.

507
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440
What did you find out?

508
00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:16.318
- Just that there are no
funeral homes in Manila


509
00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:18.320
called Chapel by the Sea.

510
00:44:18.653 --> 00:44:20.864
- They all keep quiet when they
talk about the islands.


511
00:44:21.197 --> 00:44:22.574
- But we did get an
interesting report


512
00:44:22.908 --> 00:44:23.908
from the United States.

513
00:44:25.201 --> 00:44:27.746
It seems a witness
claims that a hearse


514
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:30.332
was used in the abduction of a
basketball player.


515
00:44:30.665 --> 00:44:32.292
- Well then that ties into
the blind beggar.


516
00:44:32.626 --> 00:44:35.211
- Now we checked the manifests of
the flights on that date


517
00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:37.505
and there was a coffin
shipped to Manila.


518
00:44:38.965 --> 00:44:42.302
It was accompanied by two women
dressed in mourning


519
00:44:42.636 --> 00:44:44.679
and met by two more women.

520
00:44:45.805 --> 00:44:47.766
That's a lot of widows.

521
00:45:14.584 --> 00:45:16.211
Now gentleman it's
been a long day.


522
00:45:18.296 --> 00:45:19.464
Have some milk.

523
00:45:29.891 --> 00:45:30.891
Try that.

524
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.236
You know you, you got
great legs baby.


525
00:45:44.406 --> 00:45:45.406
Thank you.

526
00:45:48.952 --> 00:45:50.286
But they're too long.

527
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.620
Oh.

528
00:45:51.913 --> 00:45:55.500
- I don't like long legs,
they get in the way.


529
00:45:56.668 --> 00:45:57.668
Well let's see what we can do

530
00:45:57.836 --> 00:45:59.212
about keeping them out of the way.

531
00:46:11.558 --> 00:46:15.020
Well we'll see what we
can do about that.


532
00:47:23.254 --> 00:47:25.131
You're really beautiful.

533
00:47:27.425 --> 00:47:30.929
It isn't often I meet a
man like you.


534
00:47:31.262 --> 00:47:35.141
You're one I'll remember for
the rest of my life.


535
00:47:37.435 --> 00:47:39.479
And I promise you, I will.

536
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.568
- You know that's what I
like about you baby.


537
00:47:46.861 --> 00:47:47.987
You're unpredictable.

538
00:47:48.321 --> 00:47:50.490
- I am predictable
about one thing.


539
00:47:50.824 --> 00:47:51.908
I never miss.

540
00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.059
Hey boss, Mr. Mike!

541
00:49:41.392 --> 00:49:42.392
She went that way.

542
00:49:42.592 --> 00:49:43.185
Well come on.

543
00:49:43.385 --> 00:49:43.977
I will come.

544
00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:45.271
Yeah okay, well you follow me!

545
00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.724
Mr. Mike, Mr. Mike!

546
00:52:27.934 --> 00:52:28.934
Over here.

547
00:56:28.924 --> 00:56:30.009
You bastard!

548
00:56:42.563 --> 00:56:45.232
- Now you've been in
there over an hour.


549
00:56:45.566 --> 00:56:46.901
You ready to talk yet?

550
00:56:47.234 --> 00:56:50.154
Come on sweetheart, let's
get out there.


551
00:56:52.865 --> 00:56:54.075
Now look at that.

552
00:56:54.408 --> 00:56:56.827
I've been trying to teach you to
behave like a lady,


553
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:58.161
but you don't seem to
appreciate that.


554
00:56:58.361 --> 00:56:59.079
So now talk.

555
00:57:06.212 --> 00:57:07.212
Who are you?

556
00:57:07.922 --> 00:57:09.340
Why did you try to kill me?

557
00:57:11.509 --> 00:57:12.885
And where did you come from?

558
00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:20.226
I said talk.

559
00:57:27.608 --> 00:57:30.111
- The patients under cortex
control Doctor.


560
00:57:30.444 --> 00:57:31.444
Excellent.

561
00:57:31.654 --> 00:57:32.738
- Attention,
attention.


562
00:57:33.072 --> 00:57:34.615
Paulson party has arrived.

563
00:57:34.949 --> 00:57:37.451
Operation Paulson is
now in session.


564
00:57:37.785 --> 00:57:40.788
Please use all
security precautions.


565
00:57:41.122 --> 00:57:43.124
Give orders to reception.

566
00:57:43.457 --> 00:57:45.543
Take Mr. Paulson to
the alpha room.


567
00:57:45.876 --> 00:57:49.255
Maintain at 62 degrees
for 12 hours.


568
00:57:49.588 --> 00:57:52.383
Place him in the beta state at
six cycles per second.


569
00:57:52.717 --> 00:57:53.843
Yes Dr. Tsu.

570
00:58:12.236 --> 00:58:13.946
Boss, boss, that vine.

571
00:58:18.743 --> 00:58:19.785
Now be quiet.

572
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:22.913
Here let me take it in.

573
00:58:36.427 --> 00:58:38.596
Now you listen to me, come on.

574
00:58:48.939 --> 00:58:51.317
Alright back to some basics,
which way?


575
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.319
- You'll never get off
the island alive.


576
00:58:53.652 --> 00:58:55.613
- Yes that's possible,
come on let's go.


577
00:58:55.946 --> 00:58:57.364
You coming?

578
00:58:57.698 --> 00:58:59.074
- Don't worry boss, I
stay right here


579
00:58:59.408 --> 00:59:00.618
and I watch my uncles bunker.

580
00:59:01.577 --> 00:59:02.577
Your uncles what?

581
00:59:02.777 --> 00:59:03.871
My uncles boat.

582
00:59:04.205 --> 00:59:07.249
Don't worry boss, I'll be right
here when you come back


583
00:59:07.583 --> 00:59:09.335
and I'll take you home safely.

584
00:59:09.668 --> 00:59:10.668
Alright.

585
00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:16.342
Oh no, not again.

586
00:59:16.675 --> 00:59:18.844
Did you see where she went?

587
00:59:19.178 --> 00:59:23.933
- Boss, do not take your eyes off
her, she's very tricky.


588
00:59:24.558 --> 00:59:25.558
No shit.

589
00:59:31.941 --> 00:59:33.192
I'm sorry.

590
00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.610
I tried.

591
00:59:36.403 --> 00:59:41.283
But he's so damned, unpredictable.

592
00:59:42.326 --> 00:59:43.326
Sit down Linda.

593
00:59:50.167 --> 00:59:52.753
It might be amusing to have you
two exchange parts.


594
00:59:53.087 --> 00:59:55.798
You my dear, with your
lovely face and figure.


595
00:59:56.131 --> 00:59:57.383
He with his brain and sex.

596
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:03.013
- Dr. Tsu let me have another
chance, I know him.


597
01:00:04.098 --> 01:00:05.182
I know how he thinks.

598
01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:08.978
I'll find him for you and
I'll bring him back.


599
01:00:09.311 --> 01:00:10.563
Let her have another go at it.

600
01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:13.524
After all what have
we got to lose?


601
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.320
Don't fail this time.

602
01:00:18.654 --> 01:00:19.654
I won't.

603
01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:21.489
You can count on it.

604
01:00:25.452 --> 01:00:27.162
Laura keep a watch on Linda.

605
01:00:27.496 --> 01:00:28.496
You can count on it.

606
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240
Ladies.

607
01:03:13.495 --> 01:03:15.414
- Ah,
Mayan volcano soup


608
01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:18.250
is the finest I've ever tasted.

609
01:03:18.584 --> 01:03:20.127
- My chefs survival
depends on her ability


610
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.837
to satisfy my tastes.

611
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.096
Well if it isn't the
indestructible Mr. Harber.


612
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:32.765
- Oh don't let me
interrupt your snack.


613
01:03:33.098 --> 01:03:34.600
- We've been looking
forward to this meeting


614
01:03:34.933 --> 01:03:36.602
with great anticipation.

615
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.480
Please join us.

616
01:03:39.813 --> 01:03:42.191
- No thanks, I forgot my
Bank of America card,


617
01:03:42.524 --> 01:03:43.901
I'll take a rain check on it.

618
01:03:44.902 --> 01:03:46.445
Sit down Mr. Harber.

619
01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:04.004
I think you're going to be a most
interesting diversion.


620
01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:05.338
You know I got a good idea,

621
01:04:05.538 --> 01:04:06.590
but I'm gonna ask you anyway.

622
01:04:06.924 --> 01:04:08.842
What type of business you in?

623
01:04:09.176 --> 01:04:11.386
- Transplants Mr. Harber,
transplants.


624
01:04:12.763 --> 01:04:14.431
It is possible for me
to transplant


625
01:04:14.765 --> 01:04:17.101
any part of the human body.

626
01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:18.434
Any part?

627
01:04:18.634 --> 01:04:19.770
Any part.

628
01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:23.357
- Listen, what's old fish nose got
to do with transplants?


629
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:25.651
Mr. Gregorious seeks our clients

630
01:04:25.984 --> 01:04:28.070
and arranges the
financial agreement.


631
01:04:28.403 --> 01:04:30.864
My organization secures a donor.

632
01:04:31.198 --> 01:04:35.327
- See that explains the kidnapping
of the jai alai player,


633
01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:37.579
whatshisname, and the other
missing athletes.


634
01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:40.874
- Correct Mr. Harber, the law of
supply and demand.


635
01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:43.168
Strong young bodies are
at a premium.


636
01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:45.295
And how high are these premiums?

637
01:04:45.629 --> 01:04:47.548
- As high as the market will
bear Mr. Harber.


638
01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:49.716
Now take you for instance.

639
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:52.511
You're not exactly what I
would consider


640
01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:56.640
blue ribbon material, first
class merchandise.


641
01:04:56.974 --> 01:05:01.061
But with Mr. Gregorious's superb
negotiating abilities


642
01:05:01.395 --> 01:05:06.150
you could maybe command $400 to
$500,000 for your body.


643
01:05:10.612 --> 01:05:13.824
- With all due respect Doctor, I
think you're a bit high.


644
01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:16.368
I mean I would have to sell him

645
01:05:16.702 --> 01:05:19.705
completely on his, virility.

646
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:23.834
Now if he were a few
years younger.


647
01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:27.171
You're quite right Gregorious.

648
01:05:27.504 --> 01:05:29.047
But enough of these
social amenities.


649
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:32.926
I'm sure Mr. Harber is anxious to
look over his new home.


650
01:05:34.428 --> 01:05:35.971
Sure, why not?

651
01:05:58.785 --> 01:05:59.953
Isn't that Peter-

652
01:06:00.287 --> 01:06:03.874
- The Paulson case, will be my
most important achievement.


653
01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:07.669
A complete brain and
body transplant.


654
01:06:11.673 --> 01:06:14.968
It may surprise you to learn Mr.
Harber,


655
01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:16.303
he died eight hours ago.

656
01:06:17.346 --> 01:06:19.181
But he's still breathing.

657
01:06:19.514 --> 01:06:22.267
- I have placed him under an alpha
controlled consciousness.


658
01:06:23.977 --> 01:06:27.105
So his brain will not deteriorate
from lack of oxygen.


659
01:06:30.776 --> 01:06:31.776
Alright.

660
01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:36.615
Hey isn't that uh-

661
01:06:36.949 --> 01:06:40.827
- The jai alai player,
yourjai alai player.


662
01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:42.454
Is he dead?

663
01:06:42.788 --> 01:06:44.915
- On the contrary, he's in perfect
physical condition,


664
01:06:45.249 --> 01:06:46.875
but in a comatose state.

665
01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:53.215
Now Mr. Harber, ultimately you
will end up here.


666
01:06:53.548 --> 01:06:54.883
That's my voloscope.

667
01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:58.428
A What?

668
01:06:58.762 --> 01:07:00.639
My vital organs vault.

669
01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:01.973
Oh.

670
01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:06.478
You mean to tell me these
things still work?


671
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.232
- They will when
transplanted properly.


672
01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:12.276
All of these organs
are functional.


673
01:07:12.609 --> 01:07:14.903
With the discovery of my
anti-rejection serum


674
01:07:15.237 --> 01:07:18.365
it was possible for me to develop
a preserving solution.


675
01:07:19.366 --> 01:07:20.784
That's incredible.

676
01:07:21.118 --> 01:07:24.162
- Credibility is the matter of
exposure and conditioning.


677
01:07:26.331 --> 01:07:27.749
A few years ago,

678
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:31.086
an interplanetary flight was
considered incredible,


679
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.047
but now it's a simple
matter of fact.


680
01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:35.381
Such as this.

681
01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.719
All usable.

682
01:07:39.052 --> 01:07:42.306
Thawed in a matter of moments by
high frequency sound waves.


683
01:07:42.639 --> 01:07:43.765
I gotta hand it to you Doc,

684
01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.102
this is a hell of
layout you got here.


685
01:07:47.436 --> 01:07:49.187
You don't waste a damn
thing do you?


686
01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:51.815
Nothing, not even my failures.

687
01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:57.612
I call him Tyrannosaurus Rex,
after the dinosaur,


688
01:07:57.946 --> 01:08:01.241
to remind me that evolution
also made mistakes.


689
01:08:02.826 --> 01:08:03.826
I would get too close
if I were you.


690
01:08:04.026 --> 01:08:04.786
That's Goliath.

691
01:08:07.831 --> 01:08:10.000
Now let me introduce to my
pet Shangri La.


692
01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:13.920
She was my first brain transplant,

693
01:08:14.254 --> 01:08:16.089
I had to use
the brain of an ape.

694
01:08:16.423 --> 01:08:18.550
- I'd hate to come to you
with a headache Doc.


695
01:08:20.802 --> 01:08:23.055
He's Colossus.

696
01:08:23.388 --> 01:08:24.388
- Didn't he used to
play basketball?


697
01:08:24.431 --> 01:08:25.724
Hmm-mm.

698
01:08:26.058 --> 01:08:29.019
He gets terrible upset
when he's ignored.


699
01:08:31.146 --> 01:08:32.146
I think he's jealous.

700
01:08:33.148 --> 01:08:35.776
It may seem fantastic to you Mr.
Harber,


701
01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:39.321
but remember we live in an age
where fact and fiction


702
01:08:39.654 --> 01:08:41.073
are two sides of the same coin.

703
01:08:42.908 --> 01:08:44.534
These are creatures
which I created.


704
01:08:45.744 --> 01:08:46.995
Granted they are mistakes.

705
01:08:49.289 --> 01:08:50.957
- Yeah, yeah I'll go
along with that.


706
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:54.669
- Come, I have a delightful
surprise for you.


707
01:09:00.884 --> 01:09:03.720
You and I will undertake a
different kind of experiment.


708
01:09:04.054 --> 01:09:05.889
One I'm sure you will enjoy.

709
01:09:06.223 --> 01:09:08.433
- Lead on Doc, you haven't
disappointed me yet.


710
01:09:20.237 --> 01:09:21.237
Brain sex.

711
01:09:22.197 --> 01:09:23.532
There are thousands
of erotic areas


712
01:09:23.865 --> 01:09:26.618
not fully experienced by
the ordinary mind.


713
01:10:35.479 --> 01:10:38.982
- The heart is stopping,
reaction negative.


714
01:10:42.694 --> 01:10:44.613
Emergency, emergency.

715
01:10:44.946 --> 01:10:47.532
The brain is close to the
deterioration point.


716
01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:49.117
Notify Dr. Tsu.

717
01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:53.038
- Emergency,
emergency, Dr. Tsu, emergency.


718
01:10:53.371 --> 01:10:54.748
Paulson's heart has stopped.

719
01:10:55.081 --> 01:10:59.169
Dr. Tsu emergency, Paulson's
heart has stopped.


720
01:10:59.503 --> 01:11:02.464
- Prepare him for
surgery immediately.


721
01:11:06.384 --> 01:11:08.178
I will rejoin you later.

722
01:11:20.899 --> 01:11:23.360
Have Vera join me in the
operating room immediately.


723
01:11:26.238 --> 01:11:28.657
Arrest her, place her in detention

724
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:30.909
and schedule her for a
complete dissection.


725
01:11:32.327 --> 01:11:33.327
Take her away.

726
01:11:33.453 --> 01:11:34.453
Move.

727
01:11:37.415 --> 01:11:41.795
- Guard, take Mr.
Harber to my office.


728
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.960
- Linda, don't shoot I
want out too.


729
01:13:49.422 --> 01:13:50.422
Together we can make it.

730
01:13:51.675 --> 01:13:54.094
Good, let's get Mike out.

731
01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:55.427
Just a minute,

732
01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:56.679
we need to create a diversion
or it won't work.


733
01:13:56.879 --> 01:13:57.554
You're right.

734
01:13:57.722 --> 01:13:58.722
What do we do?

735
01:14:01.059 --> 01:14:02.059
Dr. Tsu's freaks.

736
01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:02.976
Good.

737
01:14:03.269 --> 01:14:04.562
- You take this, go down
and let 'em out.


738
01:14:04.896 --> 01:14:05.896
I'll get Mike.

739
01:14:06.096 --> 01:14:06.814
We'll meet at the boat dock.

740
01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:08.149
Right.

741
01:14:51.443 --> 01:14:54.738
- Alert, alert,
escape in progress.


742
01:14:55.071 --> 01:14:58.867
The cage room specimens are loose.

743
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.078
Alert, alert, escape in progress.

744
01:15:02.412 --> 01:15:05.123
The cage room specimens are loose.

745
01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:06.958
I can't stop now.

746
01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:08.334
Bolt the doors.

747
01:15:13.673 --> 01:15:14.673
- Attention,
cage room specimens


748
01:15:14.873 --> 01:15:16.551
are to be destroyed on sight.

749
01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:19.763
Attention, cage room specimens
are to be destroyed.


750
01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:31.357
Alert, alert, escape in progress.

751
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:33.943
The cage room specimens are loose.

752
01:16:17.403 --> 01:16:18.403
- You know if it really
came down to it,


753
01:16:18.696 --> 01:16:19.989
I think you could take me.

754
01:16:20.323 --> 01:16:21.366
You've got a big mouth.

755
01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:22.992
Help me loosen up these ropes,
we've gotta get out of here.


756
01:16:23.326 --> 01:16:25.036
Pretty soon all hells
gonna break loose.


757
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.704
- Not yet, I a hundred grand
laying around here someplace


758
01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:28.248
and he's still alive.

759
01:16:28.581 --> 01:16:29.581
Who is it?

760
01:16:29.781 --> 01:16:30.374
The jai alai player.

761
01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:31.166
Grab the machine gun.

762
01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:32.417
- You know that
emergency operation?


763
01:16:32.617 --> 01:16:33.126
He's the one.

764
01:16:33.211 --> 01:16:34.211
Lead the way.

765
01:16:51.938 --> 01:16:54.274
- Attention,
red alert, red alert.


766
01:16:54.607 --> 01:16:56.401
Armed prisoners are escaping.

767
01:16:56.734 --> 01:16:59.445
Attention, red alert, red alert.

768
01:16:59.779 --> 01:17:02.031
Armed prisoners are escaping.

769
01:17:06.828 --> 01:17:07.828
He's dead.

770
01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:11.665
Leave me.

771
01:21:34.178 --> 01:21:35.596
He's unharmed Mr. Harber.

772
01:21:43.563 --> 01:21:45.022
That will do you no good.

773
01:21:45.356 --> 01:21:47.650
The glass is armored,
it's bulletproof.


774
01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.283
- Listen lady, aren't you a little
tired of playing God?


775
01:21:55.616 --> 01:21:58.661
- You won this time, but
just remember,


776
01:21:58.995 --> 01:22:01.956
like all great minds we cannot
avoid our destiny.


777
01:22:02.915 --> 01:22:04.208
Goodbye Mr. Harber.

778
01:22:14.385 --> 01:22:15.845
Come on kid, let's go home.

779
01:23:09.023 --> 01:23:11.484
- My god, I've heard a
lot of stories in my time.


780
01:23:11.817 --> 01:23:14.070
Just the idea of monsters
and transplants


781
01:23:14.403 --> 01:23:17.615
and an island of women, it's
so hard to believe.


782
01:23:17.949 --> 01:23:20.243
- You suit yourself
Lorenzo, but it's the truth.


783
01:23:20.576 --> 01:23:22.578
- Lloyds of London
won't believe it either.


784
01:23:22.912 --> 01:23:23.913
Lorenzo, it doesn't matter any

785
01:23:24.247 --> 01:23:25.665
what they believe or
don't believe,


786
01:23:25.998 --> 01:23:28.000
I delivered whatshisname,

787
01:23:28.334 --> 01:23:29.627
the jai alai player
back in one piece


788
01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:32.755
and all I want is my
check for $160,000.


789
01:23:33.089 --> 01:23:34.090
You're right, you're right.

790
01:23:34.423 --> 01:23:36.634
A deal is a deal, after all
it's not everyday


791
01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:38.886
we can save the company half
a million dollars.


792
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.847
That is with certain
large deductions.


793
01:23:49.605 --> 01:23:51.232
Now here you are.

794
01:23:51.565 --> 01:23:55.278
I'm sure it's gonna be put to
all kinds of good use.


795
01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:56.821
You can bet on it.

796
01:23:57.863 --> 01:23:59.824
- You know they're
expecting you in Rome.


797
01:24:00.157 --> 01:24:01.157
50W)'-

798
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.661
- You promised them that
you'd meet them there.


799
01:24:03.995 --> 01:24:06.706
- Postpone it, I'm gonna
take a vacation.


800
01:24:07.039 --> 01:24:08.249
