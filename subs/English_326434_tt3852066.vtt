<i>Do you ever pretend you're dead at home,
just practice?</i>


2
00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:37.122
<i>Do you ever pretend
you're dead in the bath -</i>


3
00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.081
<i>just hold your nose
and float around like a bloated corpse?</i>


4
00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:49.289
<i>Have you ever contemplated suicide</i>

5
00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:51.872
<i>just because
you're in a convenient spot to do it?</i>


6
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.164
<i>You're not particularly unhappy -</i>

7
00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.039
<i>'Yeah, that'd work,
if I was going to do it. '.</i>


8
00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:03.997
<i>Like, I was bushwalking the other day
with some friends.</i>


9
00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:07.289
<i>It was a beautiful day.
We were all connecting and chatting.</i>


10
00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:09.747
<i>We went on this big ridge,
we looked at the horizon.</i>


11
00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:13.497
<i>There's a huge drop. I looked over,
and the voice in my head went, 'Jump. '</i>


12
00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.914
<i>'What?' 'You heard me. '</i>

13
00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.747
<i>'Why?' 'You know why. '.</i>

14
00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:24.206
<i>I was making some toast
the other morning.</i>


15
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:29.747
<i>Had the knife in my hand, looking at
the toaster, waiting for it to come up.</i>


16
00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:32.664
<i>The voice said, '
Stick it in. '</i>

17
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.497
<i>'Why?' 'You know why. '.</i>

18
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:39.456
<i>I blame my father.</i>

19
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:42.706
<i>People always say to me, 'Where do you
get your sense of humour from?'.</i>


20
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.331
<i>I say, 'My old man, '</i>

21
00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.956
<i>'cause I figured out early on that there
was something really wrong with him.</i>


22
00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:02.122
<i>She goes,
'You're better looking in real life. '.</i>


23
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.206
<i>Sounds like a compliment.</i>

24
00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:11.414
<i>What it means is,
'Because on TV, you look like shit. '.</i>


25
00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.914
<i>You know, my whole life,
I've tried to improve myself,</i>


26
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.414
<i>ever since I was a young kid. I used to
read a lot, try and make myself better.</i>


27
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:25.122
<i>You know what I've realised now that
I'm older? You can't. It's hopeless.</i>


28
00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:28.831
<i>You'll never be anything different than
what you are.</i>


29
00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:31.122
<i>It's a happy story!</i>

30
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.081
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

31
00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:41.206
<i>For a long time, I thought my mother was
dead, when I was a kid.</i>


32
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:45.164
<i>I walked in the lounge room - 'Dad?'
He goes, 'What?'</i>


33
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.914
<i>'Where's Mum?' '
Your mother?</i>

34
00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.414
<i>She went mad and shot herself. '.</i>

35
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.372
<i>I was eight.</i>

36
00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:02.247
<i>I recently went to an old girlfriend's
wedding. I don't recommend it.</i>


37
00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:05.164
<i>I thought it'd be cool,
going to an old girlfriend's wedding.</i>


38
00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.122
<i>It's all a bit French and everything -
'Cool. We're all happy now. '.</i>


39
00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.747
<i>Shit.</i>

40
00:03:10.872 --> 00:03:16.497
<i>The predominant feeling at
an old girlfriend's wedding is, failure.</i>


41
00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:20.706
<i>Look at the happy couple on the altar.
'She's happy now.</i>


42
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.247
<i>I've never seen her smile like that
before. '.</i>


43
00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:33.247
<i>I've still got old girlfriends' numbers
in my phone. I can't let go.</i>


44
00:03:33.372 --> 00:03:37.206
<i>Some part of me thinks,
'Maybe we'll get back together.</i>


45
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.956
<i>Maybe I'll ring them, drunk,
at two in the morning -</i>


46
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.456
<i>'Hey! How are you?
I've been thinking about you lately.</i>


47
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.122
<i>Let's have a kid. '.</i>

48
00:03:55.247 --> 00:03:58.831
What can I say
about this fella? I mean...


49
00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:00.456
We both met starting out,

50
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.081
and it's just been
an absolute pleasure, watching him grow.


51
00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:08.747
I love him like a brother, and I'd like
to propose a toast to my friend.


52
00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:12.456
Manny, congratulations
on a really successful tour, mate.


53
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.414
Here's to Manny.

54
00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.622
Thanks, everyone. Cheers.

55
00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:22.331
Is your old man coming?

56
00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:24.456
Nah. Knew he wouldn't.

57
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.456
- Never does.
- Ah.


58
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.747
Oh, anyway,
let's just go and enjoy ourselves, eh?


59
00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.372
Yeah.

60
00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:35.247
Come on, get into it.

61
00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.331
I can't be bothered.

62
00:04:37.456 --> 00:04:38.997
Mate, you need a woman.

63
00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:41.122
Who are half these people, anyway?

64
00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.164
It doesn't matter. There's some
fucking gold in there, mate.


65
00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.789
Yeah.

66
00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:49.039
Just come and meet some of them.
Come on.


67
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.622
Come on, mate.
Just go and have a dance!


68
00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:54.914
Come on!

69
00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.289
I really connect
to everything you say.


70
00:04:57.414 --> 00:05:01.247
Thanks.
I appreciate that, but it's just jokes.


71
00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:03.039
No, you don't understand.

72
00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:05.289
What you say is the truth.

73
00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:06.914
You mean, like a prophet?

74
00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.206
Yes, you are, in a way.

75
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:12.081
Would it be strange
if I asked you for a hug?


76
00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.914
Probably.

77
00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.247
OK. Ah, sorry.

78
00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:17.872
Nah, it's alright.

79
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:20.581
Anyway, um...

80
00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:27.706
When we had hangovers,
we would have these Manny days.


81
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:32.289
We'd all get together and make these
really strong bloody Marys


82
00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:33.997
and watch your DVDs.

83
00:05:34.122 --> 00:05:36.872
What, you only find me funny
when you're drunk?


84
00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:39.706
No, no. I...

85
00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.664
So, are you, like,

86
00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.789
a manic depressive?

87
00:05:45.914 --> 00:05:48.497
- Yeah, I am, a bit.
- So am I.


88
00:05:48.622 --> 00:05:51.164
No, I'm not really. Sorry.

89
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:58.414
Apparently, you need, like, four hugs
a day to actually survive.


90
00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.289
If you don't get hugs,
if people don't get hugs,


91
00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:03.122
they can actually die.

92
00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:07.497
How do you know? How do you know
if it's manic depression?


93
00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:10.914
You might just be miserable.
Misery's not a disease.


94
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.539
It's just misery.

95
00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:16.872
Nothing wrong with being miserable,

96
00:06:16.997 --> 00:06:19.914
unless you hang around
a bunch of happy people.


97
00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.664
- They shit me.
- Do they?


98
00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.872
Yeah. Happy people shit me.

99
00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:26.414
You don't shit me.

100
00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.039
Thank you.

101
00:06:28.164 --> 00:06:30.539
'Cause you look like how I feel.

102
00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.831
You To Me Are Everything.

103
00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:49.081
Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again?

104
00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:55.206
I'm Not Coming Back.

105
00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:08.664
What are you doing out here, mate?
There's girls in there.


106
00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:10.706
What am <i>I</i> going to do with them?

107
00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.581
Have sex with one of them.

108
00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:14.247
I might just go home.

109
00:07:16.122 --> 00:07:18.497
I've got some good news for you.

110
00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:22.122
That's Joel Hillman.

111
00:07:22.247 --> 00:07:23.956
- Who?
- Joel Hillman.


112
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.747
- The American promoter. Remember?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.


113
00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:28.747
Mate, the big US tour's coming off.

114
00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:30.372
Yeah, right. Yeah.

115
00:07:31.997 --> 00:07:33.497
You're a classic, mate.

116
00:07:33.622 --> 00:07:35.122
What?

117
00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:37.664
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.


118
00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:39.289
Yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:07:40.414 --> 00:07:42.956
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers, mate.


120
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:44.789
All good.

121
00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:47.914
America, here we come.

122
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:52.289
I've never been there.

123
00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:56.414
They shouldn't let you in.

124
00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:53.539
<i>You know how they say, 'Smile,
and the whole world smiles with you'?</i>


125
00:08:53.664 --> 00:08:57.789
<i>No, they don't. They think
there's something wrong with you.</i>


126
00:08:57.914 --> 00:09:00.122
<i>I see someone walking down the street,
smiling,</i>


127
00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:02.956
<i>the first thing I think is, 'Drugs. '.</i>

128
00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:08.831
<i>If you see someone happy, you think
there's something wrong with them.</i>


129
00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:11.706
<i>You don't notice all the miserable,
unhappy people though.</i>


130
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:14.247
<i>They fade in the background,
because that's normal.</i>


131
00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.997
<i>You know, when you're famous...</i>

132
00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:21.081
<i>Being famous is, well,
it's hard sometimes.</i>


133
00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:23.122
<i>It's like you're a marked man.</i>

134
00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.622
<i>You walk the street,
people are staring at you.</i>


135
00:09:25.747 --> 00:09:29.372
<i>They point, whisper your name.
'There's Manny over there. Look at him.</i>


136
00:09:29.497 --> 00:09:31.331
<i>He's got a funny head. '.</i>

137
00:09:31.456 --> 00:09:34.622
<i>Like you've done something wrong.
Sometimes I feel like a criminal.</i>


138
00:09:34.747 --> 00:09:36.706
<i>All I did was make them laugh.</i>

139
00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:39.247
<i>Even prostitutes recognise me.</i>

140
00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:44.206
<i>I walked past one the other day. 'Hey,
Manny, want to come up for a freebie?'</i>


141
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.122
<i>'No, thanks. 
I'll pay. '.</i>

142
00:10:18.206 --> 00:10:19.706
G'day, mate.

143
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:22.581
How are you?

144
00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.372
You're a nice puppy.

145
00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.872
You by yourself tonight, hm?

146
00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:31.622
By yourself?

147
00:10:33.872 --> 00:10:35.414
Where's your mates?

148
00:10:36.581 --> 00:10:38.622
Where's your mates?

149
00:10:38.747 --> 00:10:40.247
Did they go on?

150
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:45.331
See you next time.

151
00:10:52.289 --> 00:10:55.206
<i>Abs workout
targets all those flabby bits.</i>


152
00:10:55.331 --> 00:10:56.831
<i>I just couldn't get rid of.</i>

153
00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.456
<i>I have been working out...</i>

154
00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:29.497
<i>Welcome to Fantasy Hotline. We're
just putting you through to our first...</i>


155
00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:45.956
<i>Welcome to Fantasy Hotline.</i>

156
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:49.539
<i>I'm just putting you through
to our first available lady.</i>


157
00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:54.247
<i>The young and beautiful Caroline is
ready to take your call.</i>


158
00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:57.581
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?


159
00:11:57.706 --> 00:12:00.206
<i>Hi. I'm Caroline.</i>

160
00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:02.039
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

161
00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.914
Me. I'm... Thomas.

162
00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:08.581
<i>Thomas!
Tell me what you look like, Thomas.</i>


163
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.247
I've got brown skin. 
I'm really tall.

164
00:12:12.372 --> 00:12:16.789
<i>Mmm! Tall men turn me on, Thomas.</i>

165
00:12:16.914 --> 00:12:21.247
Yeah. We're all tall in my family.
What do you look like?


166
00:12:21.372 --> 00:12:25.914
<i>- Long, leggy, curvaceous.</i>
- Oh, yeah?


167
00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:28.581
I love long, leggy, curvaceous.

168
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:32.456
<i>Tell me, Thomas, what turns you on?</i>

169
00:12:32.581 --> 00:12:37.122
Whatever. I like to do anything.
What do you like?


170
00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:41.081
<i>Let's start with a long and slow
back massage.</i>


171
00:12:41.206 --> 00:12:43.956
What?
You're going to give me a back massage?


172
00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:46.081
<i>Oh, yeah! You'll love it.</i>

173
00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:49.247
- I don't really want a back massage.
<i>- You're so tense!</i>


174
00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:52.039
- No, I don't want one.
<i>- Let me press my thumb...</i>


175
00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:53.872
I said I don't want one.

176
00:12:58.122 --> 00:12:59.956
Back massage?

177
00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:02.081
I don't want a back massage!

178
00:13:02.206 --> 00:13:04.206
It's my money. $5 a minute.

179
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:07.372
Fuck. It's cheaper
to go and get a proper massage.


180
00:13:24.497 --> 00:13:26.372
Hello?

181
00:13:26.497 --> 00:13:28.539
<i>This is</i> my <i>fantasy.</i>

182
00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:32.539
<i>I don't lay in bed at night thinking,
'I'd love to have a back massage</i>


183
00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:34.872
<i>over the phone. '.</i>

184
00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:40.164
Well. Mm, I really upset you.

185
00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:42.456
Oh, sorry.

186
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:44.706
Sorry I snapped at you.

187
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.122
I just feel like talking, really.

188
00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:51.497
What do you want to talk about?

189
00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:55.914
<i>Um, back massages? 
Just kidding.</i>

190
00:13:56.914 --> 00:13:58.747
Whatever.

191
00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.122
It's better than watching TV.

192
00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:06.622
Thomas. Sounds like a Czech name.

193
00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:08.247
<i>Are you Czech?</i>

194
00:14:09.372 --> 00:14:11.039
I don't know.

195
00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:13.081
I'm a bit of everything, really.

196
00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:14.747
<i>I'm a mongrel.</i>

197
00:14:14.872 --> 00:14:17.164
Mm, sounds strong.

198
00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.789
Yeah.

199
00:14:18.914 --> 00:14:20.539
I got big arms.

200
00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:23.956
I've got a beard.

201
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:25.581
I'm really manly.

202
00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:29.456
No, I'm not.

203
00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:32.622
<i>I'm bullshitting.</i>

204
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:36.372
<i>"I'm 5'7", bald. 
I've got wing nuts.</i>

205
00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:37.997
What's a wing nut?

206
00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:42.414
<i>Wing nuts. You know when your ears
stick out like a wing nut?</i>


207
00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:44.122
Wing nut?

208
00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:47.081
Yeah, that's what you call someone
with big ears - wing nuts.


209
00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:50.122
Anyway, that's what I've got -
fucking wing nuts.


210
00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:54.539
You think it's funny that
somebody's got wing nuts, do you?


211
00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:58.539
No! I think it's funny that
you call them 'wing nuts'.


212
00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:01.997
Anyway, let's get off my wing nuts.
Let's talk about something else.


213
00:15:02.122 --> 00:15:05.164
<i>This is supposed to be
an erotic phone call, isn't it?</i>


214
00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:07.289
If you want it to be.

215
00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:08.914
Do you want it to be?

216
00:15:09.914 --> 00:15:12.247
<i>Not really.</i>

217
00:15:12.372 --> 00:15:13.872
You're funny.

218
00:15:16.289 --> 00:15:19.664
Yeah, well,
that's one thing I'm good at.


219
00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:23.331
What, you're only good at one thing?

220
00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:26.247
Probably.

221
00:15:26.372 --> 00:15:31.497
I'm not good at anything else, really.
I mean, sometimes I feel like a loser.


222
00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:35.081
Yeah? Why do you feel like that?

223
00:15:35.206 --> 00:15:38.789
<i>Ah, let me see - it's three in the
morning, I've got the curtains drawn.</i>


224
00:15:38.914 --> 00:15:42.581
I'm talking to someone I don't even
know, having an erotic phone call.


225
00:15:42.706 --> 00:15:44.206
<i>I mean - loser.</i>

226
00:15:45.497 --> 00:15:47.914
I'm kind of doing the same thing.

227
00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:50.747
Yeah, but at least you're
getting paid for it.


228
00:15:50.872 --> 00:15:52.914
Anyway...

229
00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:56.747
it's late. Probably should go.

230
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:59.956
<i>It's been nice talking to you though.
Caroline, was it?</i>


231
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:02.831
Yeah. OK, Thomas.

232
00:16:02.956 --> 00:16:04.581
See ya.

233
00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:06.206
<i>Bye.</i>

234
00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:41.747
<i>Hello?</i>

235
00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:43.789
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>


236
00:16:43.914 --> 00:16:45.997
- Is that Caroline?
<i>- Yeah.</i>


237
00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:48.747
<i>It's me, Wing Nuts.</i>

238
00:16:48.872 --> 00:16:53.081
Thomas. You're back again.

239
00:16:53.206 --> 00:16:54.706
Yeah.

240
00:16:57.872 --> 00:16:59.581
Um...

241
00:16:59.706 --> 00:17:01.414
do you ever...

242
00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:06.372
Do you guys, I mean,
people that do your thing,


243
00:17:06.497 --> 00:17:10.872
are you allowed to kind of meet up with
people you talk on the phone with?


244
00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.997
<i>I'm not saying
I was thinking of doing that.</i>


245
00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:17.664
I'm glad you're not thinking about it,
Thomas, because unfortunately, I can't.


246
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.289
<i>I was just asking.</i>

247
00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:22.997
I'm not saying I was going to do it
anyway.


248
00:17:23.122 --> 00:17:26.122
I don't even know you. I mean,
you could be a freak or whatever.


249
00:17:28.122 --> 00:17:31.372
- You can always call.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>


250
00:17:31.497 --> 00:17:33.747
I feel a bit stupid now.

251
00:17:33.872 --> 00:17:37.872
Anyway, I'd better go to bed.
It's $5 a minute.


252
00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:39.747
<i>OK.</i>

253
00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:44.664
Anyway, I'll see you. I won't see you.
I mean, I'll...


254
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.872
I'll talk to you, whatever.

255
00:17:48.164 --> 00:17:49.664
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

256
00:17:56.081 --> 00:17:57.581
Dickhead.

257
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.581
Yoo!

258
00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:05.664
Go and score a goal, mate.

259
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:12.706
How did you end up?

260
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:15.372
Oh, you know, the usual.

261
00:18:15.497 --> 00:18:18.456
Jo was pissed off, I had a spew.

262
00:18:18.581 --> 00:18:20.914
Yeah, good times.

263
00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:23.456
You are a disaster.

264
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:25.289
Yeah, I know.

265
00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:27.622
So how are you feeling
about your time off?


266
00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.206
Yeah.

267
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:32.164
What are you going to do
for two months?


268
00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:36.164
Dunno.
Sit around, stare out the window,


269
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:40.539
wonder what's happening in my life,
cup of tea, kill myself.


270
00:18:40.664 --> 00:18:43.789
You know, normal shit.

271
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:48.122
Before you top yourself, Sad Sack,
think about the American offer.


272
00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:50.747
Yeah, I will.
What are you going to do?


273
00:18:50.872 --> 00:18:52.414
I'm doing it.

274
00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:54.039
Come to Dad, mate!

275
00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:01.914
Jump on Uncle Manny.

276
00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:04.039
Oh! Alright.

277
00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:06.997
- Is that your dad?
- No.


278
00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:08.706
Oh, yeah.

279
00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:10.581
He can't say that!

280
00:19:10.706 --> 00:19:12.914
- I'm your real dad.
- You're not my daddy.


281
00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:15.331
- He's my dad.
- No, he's a drunk.


282
00:19:15.456 --> 00:19:19.289
No, my dad's over there,
my dad's over there!


283
00:19:20.331 --> 00:19:23.247
<i>You talk a lot about your father.
What does he feel about it?</i>


284
00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:26.289
<i>Ah, he whinges a bit.
He's always whingeing.</i>


285
00:19:26.414 --> 00:19:32.372
<i>He's always saying, 'Comb your hair. It
looks like a bloody half-sucked mango. '.</i>


286
00:19:32.497 --> 00:19:37.539
<i>My head's too big for my body.
I've got no arse. I look like a foetus.</i>


287
00:19:37.664 --> 00:19:39.872
<i>You're being a bit hard on yourself,
Manny.</i>


288
00:19:39.997 --> 00:19:43.289
<i>- And I've got wing nuts.
- You really think you've got wing nuts?</i>


289
00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:45.081
<i>Yeah, look at them.</i>

290
00:19:45.206 --> 00:19:47.956
<i>Either that
or my head's too small for my ears.</i>


291
00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:52.122
<i>People always come up and say,
'I just look at you and laugh. '.</i>


292
00:19:52.247 --> 00:19:54.831
<i>I don't know whether to take that
as a compliment or not.</i>


293
00:19:57.122 --> 00:19:59.914
Right - America.
So, do you want to do it or not?


294
00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:02.122
'Cause I need an answer.

295
00:20:02.247 --> 00:20:04.456
Yeah. Why not?

296
00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:07.164
OK. You know it means living there.

297
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.497
They'll effectively own you.
Is that a problem?


298
00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:11.289
No. Let's go, let's go.

299
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:15.914
OK. Alright,
we'll get them out here for a show.


300
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.539
Yep.

301
00:20:17.664 --> 00:20:20.914
- There's just one more thing.
- What's that?


302
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:24.622
They want you to go out live
on national television, the whole show.


303
00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:26.956
Why?

304
00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:28.789
To see if you can do it.

305
00:20:28.914 --> 00:20:30.622
- What, perform?
- Yeah.


306
00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:32.247
I've done it a million times.

307
00:20:32.372 --> 00:20:35.122
What difference does it make
if there's a camera in my face?


308
00:20:35.247 --> 00:20:38.664
That's just the way they do it, mate.
That's the deal.


309
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:40.956
So do you want
to do it or not?

310
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:42.581
Yeah, I'll do it.

311
00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:46.164
Gold!
Alright, well, I'll book the State.


312
00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:53.997
What the fuck is that?

313
00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:55.956
Dunno, mate. Just eat it.

314
00:21:07.956 --> 00:21:09.997
You love your caramel slice.

315
00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:12.539
Yeah, just like Mum used to make.

316
00:21:15.164 --> 00:21:17.414
- See you, mate.
- Ciao, Manny.


317
00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.539
Ah, Hermann Hesse.

318
00:21:25.622 --> 00:21:27.122
It's a good book.

319
00:21:27.247 --> 00:21:28.914
- You've read it?
- Yeah.


320
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.914
It's about a miserable bloke
who wants to kill himself


321
00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:35.664
until he meets a woman who teaches him
how to dance and enjoy life.


322
00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:39.247
- Well, there goes the ending.
- Oh, sorry.


323
00:21:39.372 --> 00:21:40.872
It's OK.

324
00:21:40.997 --> 00:21:43.539
Anyway, I'm Manny. 
I ruin novels.

325
00:21:43.664 --> 00:21:45.497
I'm Maria.

326
00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:48.664
- I think I've seen you.
- I was just here.


327
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:51.997
- Anyway, I'd better get going.
- OK.


328
00:21:52.122 --> 00:21:54.872
Even though I've got nowhere to go.

329
00:21:54.997 --> 00:21:57.081
- I'll see you around.
- OK.


330
00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.539
Hey, ah...

331
00:22:08.664 --> 00:22:10.164
Sorry.

332
00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:15.372
Do you reckon I could get your number
and call you,


333
00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:19.331
and maybe have a coffee
and ruin another book?


334
00:22:22.456 --> 00:22:24.456
Um, sure.

335
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:26.081
Great.

336
00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:29.331
Do you have a pen?

337
00:22:29.456 --> 00:22:31.081
No. Do you have one?

338
00:22:31.206 --> 00:22:32.706
No.

339
00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:36.206
I think Armando...

340
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:37.831
Man, here!

341
00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:41.456
Oh. Yep.

342
00:23:24.831 --> 00:23:27.122
The finest comedian!

343
00:23:27.247 --> 00:23:28.747
How are you going, Dad?

344
00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:30.622
How the bloody hell are you?

345
00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:32.872
You finally decided
to visit your old man.


346
00:23:32.997 --> 00:23:35.497
- You could visit me.
- Here we go. Don't start.


347
00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:37.872
- You started.
- You can't argue with you, can you?


348
00:23:37.997 --> 00:23:39.789
You've always got to have the last word.

349
00:23:39.914 --> 00:23:42.081
- If I don't, you will.
- How's your shows going?


350
00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:44.456
- Good. You should come one time.
- I don't have to.


351
00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:47.706
I know what you talk about.
You talk about me half the time.


352
00:23:47.831 --> 00:23:50.247
It's all bloody bullshit anyway.

353
00:24:24.372 --> 00:24:26.289
- What's that?
- What?


354
00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:28.706
DVD with a naked girl on the front.

355
00:24:28.831 --> 00:24:31.872
Oh. Cloudy gave me that awhile back.

356
00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:33.622
- You ever watch it?
- Nah.


357
00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:35.789
Bullshit. Stick it on.

358
00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:43.997
You've got to be fit to do that.

359
00:24:44.997 --> 00:24:46.622
You had enough?

360
00:24:46.747 --> 00:24:48.289
You wanted to watch it.

361
00:24:48.414 --> 00:24:51.914
Just wanted to have a look.
I didn't want to watch the whole thing.


362
00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:53.581
I feel a bit sick now.

363
00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.914
Well, what do you want to do?

364
00:25:03.122 --> 00:25:06.414
Do you want to go out for lunch
or something?


365
00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:08.039
Lunch? Don't be fucking stupid!

366
00:25:08.164 --> 00:25:11.289
- Why's it stupid?
- Go to some bloody poofy cafe


367
00:25:11.414 --> 00:25:14.789
and pay ten bucks for one carrot?
There's bloody food in the fridge.


368
00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:16.997
Well, forget it.

369
00:25:17.122 --> 00:25:19.247
Do you want to go for a walk?

370
00:25:19.372 --> 00:25:21.747
What am I, your girlfriend?

371
00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:25.789
You never bring your girlfriends
out here.


372
00:25:25.914 --> 00:25:27.914
I would if I had one.

373
00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:30.956
When you going to make me a grandfather?

374
00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:33.581
When I get one of them pregnant.

375
00:25:37.372 --> 00:25:39.622
- Beer?
- Beer?


376
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.247
It's 11:30.

377
00:25:41.372 --> 00:25:43.997
Didn't the doctor say
you shouldn't be drinking?


378
00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:45.914
Mate, I gave up smoking.

379
00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:48.664
Haven't had a root
since your mother died.


380
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:53.956
Drinking's the only thing I've got left.
I'm drinking. Do you want one or not?


381
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:55.581
Yeah, righto.

382
00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:06.581
Right. Ring her up, say hello,

383
00:26:06.706 --> 00:26:11.039
ask her how she is, try to listen
to the answer, if that's possible.


384
00:26:11.164 --> 00:26:14.247
Talk about the weather,
not for too long.


385
00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:18.039
Then just ask her out
and get the fuck off the phone.


386
00:26:27.622 --> 00:26:29.122
Hi. Maria speaking.

387
00:26:29.247 --> 00:26:33.081
Oh, hi. It's Manny from down the cafe.

388
00:26:33.206 --> 00:26:36.164
Oh, hi, Manny. How are you?

389
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:37.789
<i>Yeah, I'm good.</i>

390
00:26:37.914 --> 00:26:41.039
How are you?
It was warm today, wasn't it?


391
00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:45.539
Yeah, a little bit.

392
00:26:47.747 --> 00:26:52.747
I was just wondering, are you
doing anything on Saturday night?


393
00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:55.831
<i>Saturday I'm busy. 
I'm sorry.</i>

394
00:26:56.831 --> 00:26:59.581
<i>Oh, OK. Well, what about Sunday?</i>

395
00:26:59.706 --> 00:27:02.289
No, Sunday, I'm busy all day and night.

396
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.039
Oh.

397
00:27:06.872 --> 00:27:10.956
OK, well, maybe I'll just see you around
some time.


398
00:27:11.081 --> 00:27:13.414
Um, I'm not busy tonight.

399
00:27:14.497 --> 00:27:16.289
<i>If you're free tonight.</i>

400
00:27:16.414 --> 00:27:20.289
Yeah, I am. I forgot about tonight.
That would be good.


401
00:27:20.414 --> 00:27:22.206
Great!

402
00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:25.122
<i>Perfect! Alright, 
I'll see you then.</i>

403
00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:26.747
OK.

404
00:27:29.456 --> 00:27:30.997
Yeah!

405
00:27:31.122 --> 00:27:34.497
This Charming Man

406
00:28:18.956 --> 00:28:20.456
Jesus.

407
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:23.331
Can you be normal tonight,
is that possible?


408
00:28:23.456 --> 00:28:27.331
Just be normal.
Don't tell her about your colonic.


409
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:29.747
You know what,
don't even talk about your arse.


410
00:28:29.872 --> 00:28:33.331
Just leave your arse
out of the conversation.


411
00:28:33.456 --> 00:28:35.914
When she talks, listen, you know?

412
00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:39.831
Don't glaze over while she's talking,
otherwise you look bored.


413
00:28:39.956 --> 00:28:42.914
You might be a bit bored at some point.
That's cool.


414
00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:45.539
Just don't let on that you're bored.

415
00:28:45.664 --> 00:28:48.247
Don't act sexy, whatever that is.
We can't be sexy.


416
00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:51.456
I'm not sexy. You sexy? 
Nobody's sexy.

417
00:28:51.581 --> 00:28:54.372
Pay for the meal. That's a good idea,
'cause you asked her out.


418
00:28:54.497 --> 00:28:58.372
That's the law.
If you ask them out, you've got to pay.


419
00:28:58.497 --> 00:29:02.706
Don't shovel the food in your mouth
like a guts, even though you are a guts.


420
00:29:02.831 --> 00:29:06.872
Just pretend that you're not a guts,
for one night.


421
00:29:06.997 --> 00:29:09.331
Can you do that, please?

422
00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:12.122
Just be normal, alright?

423
00:29:12.247 --> 00:29:13.747
Normal.

424
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:34.997
He always does that.

425
00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:36.747
First time I came here, I got beers.

426
00:29:36.872 --> 00:29:40.206
Now every time I come here, he gives me
beer before I have a chance to order.


427
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:43.247
I kind of like it, even though
I don't feel like beer sometimes.


428
00:29:43.372 --> 00:29:45.122
Would you mind if I had wine?

429
00:29:45.247 --> 00:29:47.831
He might get pissed off.
He's from Czechoslovakia.


430
00:29:47.956 --> 00:29:50.539
They're all a bit depressed there.

431
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:53.081
Excuse me?

432
00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:56.081
Could I get a
glass of red wine, please?

433
00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:58.289
OK.

434
00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:02.456
It's alright. I'll have hers.
I feel like two anyway.


435
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:09.122
Hey, look, it's a mandorla.

436
00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:14.622
- What's a mandorla?
- Mandorla is the almond shape


437
00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:16.789
that the two circles make
when they overlap.


438
00:30:16.914 --> 00:30:18.414
That's the mandorla.

439
00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:20.039
Right.

440
00:30:21.122 --> 00:30:23.331
Yo, funny guy!

441
00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:24.956
Mate, great!

442
00:30:26.331 --> 00:30:28.456
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah, no.


443
00:30:28.581 --> 00:30:30.581
I know him from work and stuff.

444
00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:32.206
I know. I've seen you perform.

445
00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:35.164
Oh, yeah? Hope you got a few laughs.

446
00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:38.039
- Yeah, I did.
- Just a few?


447
00:30:38.164 --> 00:30:40.122
Oh, no. I thought it was really funny.

448
00:30:40.247 --> 00:30:41.956
All of it?

449
00:30:42.081 --> 00:30:43.747
Do you like feedback about your show?

450
00:30:45.247 --> 00:30:48.331
Sort of. I mean,
over the years, I've heard it all.


451
00:30:48.456 --> 00:30:50.831
Some people say I'm great,
some people say I'm shit.


452
00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:54.831
No, I loved it.
Manny, I think you're really funny.


453
00:30:56.122 --> 00:30:57.622
But, um,

454
00:30:57.747 --> 00:31:02.039
if you don't mind me being honest,
you looked a bit tired.


455
00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:07.539
I am.

456
00:31:07.664 --> 00:31:10.372
20 years of telling people what I think,
what I reckon...


457
00:31:10.497 --> 00:31:14.914
I mean, I like making people laugh,
but I'm worn out.


458
00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.164
Anyway, what do <i>you</i> do?

459
00:31:19.164 --> 00:31:20.664
Um...

460
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:22.497
I work in a call centre.

461
00:31:22.622 --> 00:31:25.122
Oh, yeah? What do you call people about?

462
00:31:25.247 --> 00:31:27.206
All sorts of stuff.

463
00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.539
Mysterious! What sort of stuff?

464
00:31:29.664 --> 00:31:33.456
Just all sorts of jobs.

465
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.122
It's confidential.

466
00:31:35.247 --> 00:31:40.872
You know you've got a really nice voice?
Really feminine and calming.


467
00:31:40.997 --> 00:31:42.497
Thank you.

468
00:31:42.622 --> 00:31:45.122
If I didn't know you
and I was talking to you on the phone,


469
00:31:45.247 --> 00:31:48.039
I'd think you were really sexy.

470
00:31:48.164 --> 00:31:49.831
I wouldn't tell you what to do,

471
00:31:49.956 --> 00:31:52.331
but you could make a lot of money,
using your voice.


472
00:31:52.456 --> 00:31:54.164
There's something I should tell you.

473
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:58.997
Radio commercials and GPS
and fantasy hotlines.


474
00:31:59.122 --> 00:32:00.622
I'm not saying you do that, but...

475
00:32:00.747 --> 00:32:05.997
Anyway, that's just what I reckon.
Sorry. What were you saying?


476
00:32:06.122 --> 00:32:10.122
I... I forget.
Thanks for saying all that.


477
00:32:16.747 --> 00:32:19.497
I should go.
You've probably got things to do.


478
00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:21.456
Oh, OK.

479
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:24.706
No... I'm sure you're busy too.

480
00:32:26.331 --> 00:32:27.831
Yeah. Anyway...

481
00:32:27.956 --> 00:32:29.456
OK.

482
00:32:31.414 --> 00:32:34.497
I'm up for another drink if you are.

483
00:32:34.622 --> 00:32:36.122
Sure.

484
00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:37.747
Right.

485
00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:40.747
I know this really nice place
around the corner.


486
00:32:40.872 --> 00:32:42.372
Let's go.

487
00:32:42.497 --> 00:32:43.997
Mambo!

488
00:32:44.122 --> 00:32:46.247
♪ LATIN PIANO AND PERCUSSION

489
00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.581
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


490
00:33:17.581 --> 00:33:19.081
Mm, salt.

491
00:33:26.247 --> 00:33:27.956
- I love salsa.
- Yeah?


492
00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:31.372
What do you like about it?

493
00:33:31.497 --> 00:33:34.289
- Look how happy they all are.
- Yeah.


494
00:33:34.414 --> 00:33:36.206
- It's pretty sexy.
- Yeah.


495
00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:38.164
Can you salsa?

496
00:33:38.289 --> 00:33:41.872
Yeah, probably when I'm pissed,
do my own version.


497
00:33:43.706 --> 00:33:45.539
- You want to give it a go?
- Really?


498
00:33:45.664 --> 00:33:47.164
- Yeah.
- Ah...


499
00:33:47.289 --> 00:33:48.789
- Come on.
- Come on!


500
00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:51.997
Hang on.

501
00:33:56.497 --> 00:33:57.997
OK

502
00:36:41.081 --> 00:36:43.372
<i>Hello?</i>

503
00:36:43.497 --> 00:36:44.997
Hi, it's Manny.

504
00:36:45.122 --> 00:36:47.497
You know, the guy from the awkward hug
in the street?


505
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.206
<i>Yeah.</i>

506
00:36:49.331 --> 00:36:52.914
I just wanted to say,
thanks for tonight. I enjoyed it.


507
00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:55.081
And um, see you soon.

508
00:36:55.206 --> 00:36:57.122
<i>See you soon.</i>

509
00:36:57.247 --> 00:37:00.706
Alright.
Oh, by the way, I'm not stalking you.


510
00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:03.789
Alright. See ya.

511
00:37:03.914 --> 00:37:05.414
<i>Bye.</i>

512
00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:15.122
Probably should have waited
a couple of days before I called her.


513
00:37:15.247 --> 00:37:18.997
Wait for what,
some other bloke to call her?


514
00:37:19.122 --> 00:37:21.706
I don't want to look too desperate.

515
00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:23.372
I <i>am</i> desperate!

516
00:37:23.497 --> 00:37:26.164
I don't go out with anyone.

517
00:37:26.289 --> 00:37:28.539
You can't look too keen.

518
00:37:28.664 --> 00:37:32.247
What do you want to look like, then - a
fucking zombie who doesn't give a shit?


519
00:37:32.372 --> 00:37:33.914
<i>That's</i> attractive.

520
00:37:47.747 --> 00:37:49.289
Hello?

521
00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:50.914
<i>Caroline?</i>

522
00:37:51.914 --> 00:37:53.414
Thomas?

523
00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:56.372
I haven't heard from you in awhile.

524
00:37:56.497 --> 00:37:59.331
Believe it or not, 
I've met a girl.

525
00:38:01.247 --> 00:38:02.831
How's it going?

526
00:38:02.956 --> 00:38:05.122
<i>Mm, good.</i>

527
00:38:05.247 --> 00:38:06.747
Just 'good'?

528
00:38:07.956 --> 00:38:09.789
<i>It's got potential.</i>

529
00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:12.997
<i>But, you know,
the normal stuff comes up.</i>


530
00:38:13.122 --> 00:38:16.372
<i>You know - you always
find something wrong with them.</i>


531
00:38:16.497 --> 00:38:18.122
Like what?

532
00:38:18.247 --> 00:38:22.747
<i>Nothing serious. Just normal stuff.
I mean, it's just boring.</i>


533
00:38:22.872 --> 00:38:24.997
Oh, no. This is interesting.

534
00:38:25.122 --> 00:38:28.372
Well, I feel bad for saying it, but...

535
00:38:28.497 --> 00:38:31.331
she makes this noise with her lips
when she's eating.


536
00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:35.289
What noise?

537
00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:37.122
<i>'Mm-num-num-num... '.</i>

538
00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:40.039
<i>Drives me nuts.</i>

539
00:38:40.164 --> 00:38:41.664
Yeah.

540
00:38:42.956 --> 00:38:45.789
So what else bothers you about her?

541
00:38:45.914 --> 00:38:47.997
<i>She's a bit straight.</i>

542
00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:49.622
Straight?

543
00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:54.414
Yeah, just a bit old-fashioned.
But, you know, I can get around that.


544
00:38:57.456 --> 00:39:01.206
Well, there must be something you like
about her.


545
00:39:02.456 --> 00:39:04.664
Do you find her attractive?

546
00:39:04.789 --> 00:39:06.289
<i>Yeah.</i>

547
00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:09.081
Well, what do you mean, 'yeah'?

548
00:39:09.206 --> 00:39:13.789
<i>Well, she's not a glamour,
but I don't like glamours anyway.</i>


549
00:39:13.914 --> 00:39:18.372
<i>I like girls that look like
they want to make soup and watch DVDs.</i>


550
00:39:18.497 --> 00:39:20.872
I don't know. I always feel this way.

551
00:39:20.997 --> 00:39:25.706
I start going out with someone,
I feel like bolting at the same time.


552
00:39:25.831 --> 00:39:27.331
<i>Why?</i>

553
00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:33.081
Getting close to someone
and all that stuff.


554
00:39:33.206 --> 00:39:34.706
I just get scared.

555
00:39:37.664 --> 00:39:39.539
<i>But I like her.</i>

556
00:39:39.664 --> 00:39:42.831
<i>She looks to me in the eye
when she's talking to me.</i>


557
00:39:42.956 --> 00:39:46.247
<i>I've been having fun with her.
She's great.</i>


558
00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:50.789
Dad, can I please go
and play with the ducks, please?


559
00:39:50.914 --> 00:39:52.539
Yes, mate. Off you go.

560
00:39:58.872 --> 00:40:02.539
Ever think about leaving your wife and
kids and going back to your old life?


561
00:40:04.664 --> 00:40:06.372
Every day.

562
00:40:06.497 --> 00:40:08.747
Why don't you?

563
00:40:08.872 --> 00:40:10.456
'Cause I love my family.

564
00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:12.581
Fair enough.

565
00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:14.206
You should have one, you know.

566
00:40:14.331 --> 00:40:16.164
I reckon you'd love it.

567
00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:19.164
A bit of balance in your life
instead of performing all the time.


568
00:40:19.289 --> 00:40:23.206
Yeah, I know. I'm not against it.
Just got to get a girlfriend first.


569
00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:25.372
Well, stop fart-arseing around
and get one.


570
00:40:25.497 --> 00:40:28.456
Sure. What else am I going to do,
sit around and blow-dry my pubes?


571
00:40:32.456 --> 00:40:34.581
Right. So that's a yes, then?

572
00:40:34.706 --> 00:40:36.456
Yeah, alright.

573
00:40:38.206 --> 00:40:40.914
Ethan! Don't piss on the ducks, son.

574
00:41:03.039 --> 00:41:04.539
- Hello.
- Hi.


575
00:41:04.664 --> 00:41:06.164
Come in.

576
00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:09.706
Oh!

577
00:41:10.914 --> 00:41:13.247
- Wow!
- Yeah.


578
00:41:13.372 --> 00:41:15.914
My God, you have the harbour
<i>and</i> the city.


579
00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:19.456
When I'm feeling happy,
I look at the harbour


580
00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:22.581
and when I'm feeling depressed,
I look at the city.


581
00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:25.497
When I don't feel anything at all,
I just stare at the carpet.


582
00:41:25.622 --> 00:41:27.247
Do you want a cup of tea?

583
00:41:27.372 --> 00:41:28.872
That'd be great.

584
00:41:32.914 --> 00:41:35.372
Mm, yum!

585
00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:37.956
Iced VoVos. I love Iced VoVos.

586
00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:40.081
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.


587
00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:42.622
- Ever do that thing?
- What thing?


588
00:41:42.747 --> 00:41:45.747
You know, where you take the
pink stripes off first, then leave...


589
00:41:45.872 --> 00:41:47.414
I'll show you.

590
00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:49.664
- Watching?
- I'm watching.


591
00:41:49.789 --> 00:41:51.706
Mm...

592
00:41:58.122 --> 00:41:59.747
What's so good about the red bit?

593
00:41:59.872 --> 00:42:01.706
I don't know.

594
00:42:01.831 --> 00:42:04.789
I've been doing it since I was a kid.
It's just fun.


595
00:42:07.039 --> 00:42:08.539
I got a little bit of the rim.

596
00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:12.414
I didn't understand any of that -
'Rr-rr-rr-rp.'


597
00:42:13.414 --> 00:42:16.414
- What are you looking at me for?
- You've got coconut...


598
00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:19.706
You're not supposed to make eye contact
when you do it. Quite creepy.


599
00:42:19.831 --> 00:42:21.331
Good.

600
00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:23.539
You've got some coconut...

601
00:42:24.622 --> 00:42:26.747
- Yeah. I want it there.
- Just leaving it?


602
00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:28.664
- Yeah.
- For dinner?


603
00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:30.622
- For Ron.
- Who's Ron?


604
00:42:30.747 --> 00:42:32.414
Later on.

605
00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.206
Boom!

606
00:42:34.331 --> 00:42:36.956
You don't know that one? 
That's so old.

607
00:42:41.081 --> 00:42:42.581
Boom!

608
00:42:42.706 --> 00:42:44.206
Champion.

609
00:42:45.497 --> 00:42:46.997
Loser.

610
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:51.081
Are you watching?

611
00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:55.539
Tada!

612
00:42:58.497 --> 00:42:59.997
What is it?

613
00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:02.289
It's my trick. 
It's the Opera House.

614
00:43:02.414 --> 00:43:04.539
- Oh, yeah!
- That was my trick, growing up.


615
00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:06.581
Oh, right. Where'd you grow up?

616
00:43:06.706 --> 00:43:08.206
- Gympie.
- Gympie?


617
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:09.831
Gympie.

618
00:43:09.956 --> 00:43:13.247
- Parents still out there?
- Mum's still there.

That was very sweet,
you wrote a song about me.

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:12.622
Actually, it's about this other girl
in Gympie called Maria.


632
00:44:12.747 --> 00:44:14.456
Bad joke, sorry. Yeah.

633
00:44:16.164 --> 00:44:18.164
Um, so...

634
00:44:19.872 --> 00:44:21.956
what do you want to do now?

635
00:44:22.081 --> 00:44:24.747
I brought some soup.
I don't know if you like soup.


636
00:44:24.872 --> 00:44:26.831
You made soup?

637
00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:28.456
I love soup.

638
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:31.331
And I don't know if you feel like
watching a movie.


639
00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:34.914
Yeah You brought a movie and soup.
Good guess.


640
00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.539
Let's watch it.

641
00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:42.497
She's great. We got along really well.
It was like a perfect date.


642
00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:45.622
- Great!
<i>- Well, not perfect.</i>


643
00:44:45.747 --> 00:44:47.414
<i>There's always something missing.</i>

644
00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:49.039
<i>Like?</i>

645
00:44:50.372 --> 00:44:53.872
She always has her hair up.
Kind of looks like a librarian.


646
00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:59.831
<i>She wears loose clothes. I mean,
what's she hiding, what's under there?</i>


647
00:44:59.956 --> 00:45:01.831
Who knows?

648
00:45:01.956 --> 00:45:03.456
<i>It's not the only thing.</i>

649
00:45:05.331 --> 00:45:06.831
The thing is...

650
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.581
I think she's beautiful.

651
00:45:11.706 --> 00:45:13.247
<i>She doesn't know it.</i>

652
00:45:16.956 --> 00:45:19.664
<i>That's what I really like about her.</i>

653
00:45:35.872 --> 00:45:37.372
What is it?

654
00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:41.039
You look great.

655
00:45:41.164 --> 00:45:42.914
Really?

656
00:45:43.039 --> 00:45:44.539
Yeah!

657
00:45:44.664 --> 00:45:46.164
OK. Thanks.

658
00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:49.539
Shall we?

659
00:46:06.706 --> 00:46:09.331
Oh, no,
this is going to be embarrassing.


660
00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:11.664
Come. Armando!

661
00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:13.581
- Hey!
- Hey.


662
00:46:15.747 --> 00:46:16.789
Maria!

663
00:46:20.247 --> 00:46:22.164
How are you?

664
00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:23.789
This is Manny.

665
00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:26.164
- You're very muscly, very brown.
- Oh, thank you.


666
00:46:28.747 --> 00:46:31.164
Are you enjoying it?

667
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:33.331
Yeah.

668
00:46:33.456 --> 00:46:35.664
It's kind of like beans and meat,
really.


669
00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:37.706
It's feijoada.

670
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:39.331
Fezh-what?

671
00:46:39.456 --> 00:46:40.956
Feijoada.

672
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:44.206
Sounds like you're saying, 'Fish water'.

673
00:46:46.372 --> 00:46:47.914
Aren't they great?

674
00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:52.831
Yeah. No, it's good.

675
00:46:52.956 --> 00:46:54.747
Bit loud, don't you reckon?

676
00:46:54.872 --> 00:46:58.247
They offered me a spot on the boat
back to Hio.


677
00:47:00.122 --> 00:47:01.747
Back to where?

678
00:47:01.872 --> 00:47:03.664
Rio de Janeiro.

679
00:47:03.789 --> 00:47:05.289
Oh, I see.

680
00:47:05.414 --> 00:47:06.956
What?

681
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.789
I mean, Rio de Janeiro?

682
00:47:08.914 --> 00:47:11.872
No. In Brazil, we say, '
Hio de Janeiro'.

683
00:47:11.997 --> 00:47:13.664
I'm soh-hy.

684
00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:15.747
I'm Hong.

685
00:47:16.956 --> 00:47:18.914
So...

686
00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:20.997
you going to go?

687
00:47:21.122 --> 00:47:22.664
I'd love to.

688
00:47:24.622 --> 00:47:26.831
I don't know. It's a fantasy.

689
00:47:37.831 --> 00:47:39.831
What, who?

690
00:47:39.956 --> 00:47:42.081
Did you always want to go to Brazil?

691
00:47:42.206 --> 00:47:45.831
Well, they all seem really happy.

692
00:47:45.956 --> 00:47:47.622
They know how to have fun.

693
00:47:47.747 --> 00:47:49.247
Yeah, right.

694
00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:51.289
- Hey, funnyman!
- Incoming.


695
00:47:51.414 --> 00:47:53.539
- Can we swap chairs?
- Yeah.


696
00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:58.789
If he comes over,
we'll pretend we're having an argument,


697
00:47:58.914 --> 00:48:00.747
and he'll leave us alone.

698
00:48:00.872 --> 00:48:02.747
What did you just say?!

699
00:48:02.872 --> 00:48:05.372
- I was just...
- How dare you!


700
00:48:05.497 --> 00:48:08.914
I don't have to put up with this.
I'm leaving.


701
00:48:19.081 --> 00:48:22.122
Jesus! You don't hold back, do you?

702
00:48:22.247 --> 00:48:23.747
That really hurt!

703
00:48:23.872 --> 00:48:27.039
- Does it really hurt?
- Yeah. Ow!


704
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:39.831
<i>She's thinking about going to Brazil.</i>

705
00:48:39.956 --> 00:48:42.206
And how do you feel about that?

706
00:48:42.331 --> 00:48:45.789
To be honest, there's always part of me
that feels relief.


707
00:48:45.914 --> 00:48:48.039
<i>Relieved of what?</i>

708
00:48:48.164 --> 00:48:50.664
The burden of having a girlfriend.

709
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:53.497
<i>You've got to deal with their shit,</i>

710
00:48:53.622 --> 00:48:56.664
<i>you've got to listen to all the things
they have to say about you.</i>


711
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:59.747
I mean, I don't need help hating myself.

712
00:49:01.497 --> 00:49:04.956
It's exhausting, being a boyfriend.

713
00:49:06.706 --> 00:49:08.206
But you know...

714
00:49:09.414 --> 00:49:11.206
I don't want her to go.

715
00:49:15.456 --> 00:49:16.956
So?

716
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:20.956
How's it going with the new girlfriend?

717
00:49:21.081 --> 00:49:23.289
It's great.

718
00:49:23.414 --> 00:49:25.372
I just love talking to her.

719
00:49:30.372 --> 00:49:31.872
What?

720
00:49:31.997 --> 00:49:34.956
Your whole face changes
when you talk about her.


721
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:37.081
Yeah, I know.

722
00:49:38.914 --> 00:49:41.497
I've got that sick feeling though.

723
00:49:41.622 --> 00:49:43.122
What do you mean?

724
00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:47.289
You know,
when something good is happening?


725
00:49:49.581 --> 00:49:52.289
What? Stop looking at me.

726
00:49:52.414 --> 00:49:54.164
Don't be like that.

727
00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:01.997
Hi.

728
00:50:03.497 --> 00:50:05.539
Do you like kids?

729
00:50:05.664 --> 00:50:07.497
Sort of.

730
00:50:07.622 --> 00:50:09.414
You ever think about having them?

731
00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:13.164
Jesus! Three dates,
we're having the kid conversation.


732
00:50:13.289 --> 00:50:15.039
No, I'm just curious.

733
00:50:15.164 --> 00:50:18.664
I'm not against them,
I mean, if the right person comes along.


734
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:20.456
I don't really think about that much.

735
00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:24.122
Except their parents with their fucking
eyeballs bulging out of their heads,


736
00:50:24.247 --> 00:50:26.706
going, 'I haven't slept in two years!'

737
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:28.497
- It's him!
- Uh-oh.


738
00:50:28.622 --> 00:50:31.039
- What?
- Incoming.


739
00:50:31.164 --> 00:50:33.747
- What do you want me to do?
- Dunno.


740
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:52.331
Was that a real
kiss or a fake kiss?

741
00:50:54.872 --> 00:50:56.372
This is a fake one.

742
00:51:00.039 --> 00:51:02.081
And this is a real one.

743
00:51:08.956 --> 00:51:10.747
What did that feel like?

744
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:13.289
A real one.

745
00:51:13.414 --> 00:51:15.956
I wish those guys would come back.

746
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:19.581
Let's go for a swim.

747
00:51:19.706 --> 00:51:21.622
- Serious?
- Yeah, let's do it.


748
00:51:21.747 --> 00:51:24.331
- No way!
- Come on, it'll be great.


749
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:26.247
- We'll get wet!
- Yeah!


750
00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:28.664
- You go in.
- You don't think I will?


751
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:30.664
Go on, then.

752
00:51:34.997 --> 00:51:36.497
What about now?

753
00:51:36.622 --> 00:51:38.664
- I'm still not going in.
- Come on!


754
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:40.539
- I don't want to.
- Stop thinking!


755
00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.789
Come on, it'll be fun.
Don't be such a killjoy.


756
00:51:42.914 --> 00:51:44.622
I said, I don't want to!

757
00:51:51.622 --> 00:51:53.247
Anyway.

758
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.497
Sorry for snapping.

759
00:52:07.622 --> 00:52:09.414
I just don't like water.

760
00:52:10.664 --> 00:52:12.164
Why don't you like water?

761
00:52:12.289 --> 00:52:13.789
I just don't.

762
00:52:18.039 --> 00:52:19.997
Can we just go home? So...

763
00:52:22.081 --> 00:52:23.914
I'm OK. I'm just
going to get a cab.

764
00:52:24.039 --> 00:52:25.081
Yeah.

765
00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:29.081

00:53:41.956 --> 00:53:45.539
<i>Basically, I didn't want
to do something, she kept pushing me,</i>


782
00:53:45.664 --> 00:53:47.164
<i>and I snapped.</i>

783
00:53:48.622 --> 00:53:50.497
What do you mean, pushing you?

784
00:53:52.331 --> 00:53:55.581
I said
I didn't want to swim in the harbour.


785
00:53:56.914 --> 00:54:00.289
And she just kept going, and...

786
00:54:01.289 --> 00:54:03.622
trying to make me do it,
and I didn't want to.


787
00:54:03.747 --> 00:54:07.414
Maybe she was trying to be romantic.

788
00:54:07.539 --> 00:54:11.081
<i>Yeah, that's what she said,
but I don't like to be pushed.</i>


789
00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:13.622
I've just always had this thing.

790
00:54:15.039 --> 00:54:17.539
I just hate getting wet.

791
00:54:17.664 --> 00:54:19.164
<i>Why?</i>

792
00:54:21.164 --> 00:54:22.664
Well...

793
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:26.247
when I was a kid,
I remember having a bath...


794
00:54:27.747 --> 00:54:31.872
my old man coming in,
furious about something


795
00:54:31.997 --> 00:54:34.414
and holding my head underwater.

796
00:54:34.539 --> 00:54:37.331
I mean, I don't
know what I done wrong.

797
00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:40.331
It's kind of funny though.

798
00:54:40.456 --> 00:54:43.956
<i>Crying and blowing a bubble
at the same time.</i>


799
00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:45.831
That's terrible, Manny.

800
00:54:45.956 --> 00:54:47.664
<i>Yeah, I know. 
It</i> was <i>terrible, but...</i>

801
00:54:50.581 --> 00:54:53.539
Sorry, what did you...

802
00:54:53.664 --> 00:54:55.581
<i>What did you just call me?</i>

803
00:54:58.331 --> 00:54:59.831
Hello?

804
00:55:16.456 --> 00:55:18.247
Did she call me 'Manny'?

805
00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:21.872
Did I say I was Manny?

806
00:55:27.622 --> 00:55:29.122
How would she know?

807
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:12.331
<i>Hello?</i>

808
00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:17.581
Caroline? It's Thomas.

809
00:56:20.622 --> 00:56:22.497
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

810
00:56:23.956 --> 00:56:28.414
Well, I just found out something really
weird about the girl I've been seeing.


811
00:56:28.539 --> 00:56:30.039
<i>Mm. What's that?</i>

812
00:56:31.456 --> 00:56:33.706
I don't think she's being honest
with me.


813
00:56:33.831 --> 00:56:37.247
I just feel like
she's not who she says she is.


814
00:56:39.122 --> 00:56:42.872
<i>I guess we're all a bit like that
sometimes, aren't we, Thomas?</i>


815
00:56:42.997 --> 00:56:45.164
No. I'm honest.

816
00:56:46.164 --> 00:56:47.914
<i>I'm sure you are.</i>

817
00:56:48.039 --> 00:56:50.997
<i>Maybe she has reasons
for doing what she does.</i>


818
00:56:51.122 --> 00:56:54.247
Yeah? What reasons?

819
00:57:17.456 --> 00:57:20.414
<i>Yeah, so, meet the woman of your dreams?</i>

820
00:57:20.539 --> 00:57:23.247
<i>I don't want to meet
the woman of my dreams.</i>


821
00:57:23.372 --> 00:57:25.164
<i>I have nightmares.</i>

822
00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:27.247
<i>She's going to have three heads
and a tail,</i>


823
00:57:27.372 --> 00:57:30.497
<i>vomit coming out her eyeballs -
'Aaargh!'.</i>


824
00:57:30.622 --> 00:57:33.414
<i>Actually, there's an easy way
to break up with someone.</i>


825
00:57:33.539 --> 00:57:38.831
<i>Next time you're making love to them,
just whisper in their ear, 'Mummy.</i>


826
00:57:38.956 --> 00:57:41.456
<i>You remind me of my mother. '.</i>

827
00:57:43.622 --> 00:57:45.289
<i>That'll do the job.</i>

828
00:57:45.414 --> 00:57:49.122
<i>If she stays after that,
then you're in trouble.</i>


829
00:58:11.664 --> 00:58:14.247
When I was a kid, 
I was having a bath.

830
00:58:15.247 --> 00:58:19.539
I must have done something wrong,
'cause Dad came in all pissed off


831
00:58:19.664 --> 00:58:21.914
and held my head underwater.

832
00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:26.164
I don't know if he was punishing me
or teaching me to swim.


833
00:58:36.456 --> 00:58:38.914
Before he used to belt me,
he used to say, 'Hey, son!'


834
00:58:40.706 --> 00:58:42.206
I'd say, 'Yeah?'

835
00:58:44.456 --> 00:58:46.997
'This is going to hurt me
more than it hurts you.'


836
00:58:47.122 --> 00:58:49.372
I used to think, 'Yeah?

837
00:58:49.497 --> 00:58:52.164
Not unless you miss and hit the chair.'

838
00:58:59.706 --> 00:59:03.581
Before he used to hit me,
he used to test my eyesight.


839
00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.331
'See that, son?'

840
00:59:06.622 --> 00:59:08.456
'Yeah, I see it.'

841
00:59:08.581 --> 00:59:10.414
Ah, fuck!

842
00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:29.372
<i>Hi, Manny. It's me.</i>

843
00:59:29.497 --> 00:59:32.081
<i>Would you please call me? I just...</i>

844
00:59:33.414 --> 00:59:35.039
<i>I just want to talk.</i>

845
00:59:35.164 --> 00:59:38.622

You can look away all you like, dog.

I'll give you a good belting!

Hey!

871
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:39.747
What are you doing?

872
01:01:39.872 --> 01:01:41.539
What?

873
01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:44.122
What do you have a dog for,
if you treat it like shit?


874
01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:46.956
It licks my feet, 
Manny, not yours.

875
01:01:47.081 --> 01:01:50.372
- Don't beat the dog up, you cockhead.
- Wanker!


876
01:01:50.497 --> 01:01:53.372
Doesn't matter. Don't beat your dog up.
What's wrong with you?


877
01:01:53.497 --> 01:01:57.039
- Just stick to your jokes, Manny.
- Don't push me, you dickhead.


878
01:01:57.164 --> 01:01:59.206
What?

879
01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:01.622
Why don't you try me?

880
01:02:03.247 --> 01:02:06.039
It's my dog! Get your fucking own dog.

881

Why don't <i>you</i> feed the fucking thing?

Oi!

01:02:16.664 --> 01:02:18.497
Coppers!

884
01:02:18.622 --> 01:02:21.414
- The cop shop's right there.
- Yeah, well...


885
01:02:21.539 --> 01:02:23.581
- What's going on?
- He punched me in the face.


886
01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:24.956
No, I didn't.

887
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:28.081
Let's go.

888
01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:54.372
So...

889
01:02:55.456 --> 01:02:57.831
what was going on last night?

890
01:02:57.956 --> 01:03:01.081
It's all over the internet, mate.
It's in the papers.


891
01:03:01.206 --> 01:03:03.247
So what?

892
01:03:03.372 --> 01:03:04.872
People get pissed.

893
01:03:09.747 --> 01:03:13.497
You know
they've all got those camera phones now.


894
01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:15.414
- Everyone's seen it.
- Who cares?


895
01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:17.039
Manny, I care.

896
01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:21.914
And the Americans that I just picked up
from the airport, they care.


897
01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:26.956
And the network that's forking out
a shitload of money for your show care.


898
01:03:27.081 --> 01:03:30.497
As long as I do a funny show,
what's the problem?


899
01:03:30.622 --> 01:03:32.789
OK, I'll tell you the problem.

900
01:03:32.914 --> 01:03:36.039
It's not just about the show, Manny.

901
01:03:36.164 --> 01:03:38.081
I've been on the phone to them
for an hour


902
01:03:38.206 --> 01:03:41.706
trying to convince them that
you're not a total disaster.


903
01:03:41.831 --> 01:03:44.622
I'm sorry
you have to work for your money.


904
01:03:44.747 --> 01:03:49.372
What do you want for 20%?
To shake people's hands,


905
01:03:49.497 --> 01:03:53.706
take your family out for a good time
on the weekend, huh?


906
01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.539
Alright, mate,
you're a bit out of control.


907
01:03:58.664 --> 01:04:03.456
All I'm saying is, just try not
to ruin everything while they're here.


908
01:04:03.581 --> 01:04:05.289
Just stay off the piss.

909
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:10.414
That's rich, coming from you.

910
01:04:11.622 --> 01:04:14.664
At least I'm not drunk
in front of my kid.


911
01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.581
I think I might just walk home.

912
01:04:21.706 --> 01:04:23.206
Yeah, good idea.

913
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:06.539
Hello?

914
01:05:06.664 --> 01:05:08.164
How are you?

915
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:11.289
Are you home?

916
01:05:12.664 --> 01:05:14.456
Can I come over for a bit?

917
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:17.581
Righto.

918
01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.206
See ya.

919
01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:41.539
What happened to your hand?

920
01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:47.039
I punched a mirror.

921
01:05:49.122 --> 01:05:51.539
Why'd you punch a mirror for?

922
01:05:51.664 --> 01:05:53.164
Pissed off.

923
01:05:55.539 --> 01:05:57.039
What with?

924
01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:01.997
What did you think of me
when I was a kid?


925
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:05.206
Well, you were a good kid.

926
01:06:06.914 --> 01:06:09.414
You were a funny little bastard.

927
01:06:09.539 --> 01:06:12.664
You used to make me and your mother
laugh.


928
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:19.456
Why do you want to know that for?

929
01:06:20.872 --> 01:06:23.831
You know I was terrified of you
as a kid?


930
01:06:23.956 --> 01:06:25.456
Were you?

931
01:06:26.497 --> 01:06:27.997
Why?

932
01:06:29.872 --> 01:06:31.372
You used to hit me.

933
01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:39.831
I ain't been thinking about that lately.

934
01:06:45.122 --> 01:06:46.622
Life's been shit.

935
01:06:47.956 --> 01:06:52.414
I've been thinking about
when I was young, for some reason.


936
01:07:03.956 --> 01:07:06.997
Well, I apologise for hitting you, mate.

937
01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:47.331
Alright...

938
01:07:50.956 --> 01:07:52.456
Bye.

939
01:07:56.456 --> 01:07:57.956
Bye, friend.

940
01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:10.206
Where's your girlfriend?

941
01:08:12.497 --> 01:08:14.289
Too hard, Pieter.

942
01:08:14.414 --> 01:08:16.456
What too hard - girl?

943
01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:18.081
Yeah.

944
01:08:23.122 --> 01:08:24.622
Hey, Pieter?

945
01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:26.247
Yeah?

946
01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:28.997
Why do you always give me a beer
when I don't even order one?


947
01:08:29.122 --> 01:08:31.289
I know you. I know your brain.

948
01:08:31.414 --> 01:08:34.414
You think, think, think, never decide.

949
01:08:34.539 --> 01:08:36.497
I give you beer, you drink.

950
01:08:36.622 --> 01:08:39.581
Have beer, have woman.

951
01:08:39.706 --> 01:08:41.581
Don't think.

952
01:09:07.414 --> 01:09:11.331
<i>The number you have dialled
has been disconnected.</i>


953
01:09:23.581 --> 01:09:25.372
<i>Hello, Fantasy Hotline.</i>

954
01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:31.081
Ah, hi. I was
hoping to speak to Caroline, PIN 713?


955
01:09:31.206 --> 01:09:34.247
<i>PIN 713 is no longer with us,
I'm afraid,</i>


956
01:09:34.372 --> 01:09:36.581
<i>but I can put you through

957
01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:40.164
Oh. Well, where'd she go?

958
01:09:40.289 --> 01:09:42.456
<i>I'm sorry, I can't say.
But I can put you through</i>


959
01:09:42.581 --> 01:09:46.122
<i>to another one of our gorgeous girls,
if you'd like to chat with one of them.</i>


960
01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:47.956
No, that's OK. Thanks.

961
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:04.581
Maria!

962
01:10:06.414 --> 01:10:07.914
Maria!

963
01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.831
Manny?

964
01:10:11.956 --> 01:10:14.247
She's gone, Manny.

965
01:10:15.456 --> 01:10:17.581
Do you know where she's going?

966
01:10:17.706 --> 01:10:21.497
Man, she's going on the boat
to South America.


967
01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:23.122
South America?

968
01:10:24.372 --> 01:10:26.372
You didn't know?

969
01:10:26.497 --> 01:10:28.331
No.

970
01:10:28.456 --> 01:10:30.581
They sail tonight.

971
01:10:30.706 --> 01:10:32.706
I'm sorry.

972
01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:37.372
Oh, Manny,
she wanted me to give you something.


973
01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:46.247
Thanks, mate.

974
01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:49.914
Hey, Manny -
good luck for the show tonight.


975
01:10:50.039 --> 01:10:51.747
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

976
01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:36.956
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please make your way into the theatre.</i>


977
01:11:37.081 --> 01:11:40.122
<i>Manny Lewis Live will commence shortly.</i>

978
01:11:53.289 --> 01:11:55.706
G'day, mate.

979
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:59.497
Ah, Joel, this is Manny.
Manny, this is Joel.


980
01:11:59.622 --> 01:12:03.247
- How are you going, Joel?
- I hear you're a funny guy.


981
01:12:03.372 --> 01:12:05.706
That's a great crowd you've got
out there.


982
01:12:05.831 --> 01:12:07.331
Yeah, they're alright.

983
01:12:08.706 --> 01:12:11.122
- Congratulations.
- Well...


984
01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:14.414
if it wasn't for this bloke,
I wouldn't have anything.


985
01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:18.331
I'd still be working on a building site.
So...


986
01:12:18.456 --> 01:12:19.956
thanks, mate.

987
01:12:24.831 --> 01:12:27.539
Well, as they say in the business...

988
01:12:29.289 --> 01:12:32.247
chookers. We'll talk later.

989
01:12:32.372 --> 01:12:34.831
OK! Nice to meet you.

990
01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:36.997
- Got everything?
- Yeah, mate, I'm alright.


991
01:12:37.122 --> 01:12:38.622
- OK.
- Hey, ah...


992
01:12:40.206 --> 01:12:41.831
is the old man in?

993
01:12:41.956 --> 01:12:43.581
No. Sorry, mate.

994
01:12:53.664 --> 01:12:56.122
<i>Two minutes, Mr Lewis.</i>

995
01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.747
Yeah, righto.

996
01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:03.831
Right. Let's go be funny.

997
01:13:15.081 --> 01:13:16.914
<i>Live across Australia,</i>

998
01:13:17.039 --> 01:13:19.997
<i>please welcome our very own funnyman,
Manny Lewis.</i>


999
01:13:32.331 --> 01:13:33.831
So, where were we?

1000
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:37.247
Nice to be here. 
I was just over there,

1001
01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:40.081
and it wasn't very nice over there.
It's better over here.


1002
01:13:40.206 --> 01:13:42.539
I hope you laugh tonight.

1003
01:13:42.664 --> 01:13:44.164
I hope you laugh a lot.

1004
01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:47.206
Actually,
I hope a little bit of wee comes out.


1005
01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:49.039
That's a good night.

1006
01:13:49.164 --> 01:13:55.122
You go home - 'How was the show?'
'Look at my pants! Great show.'


1007
01:13:55.247 --> 01:13:58.414
I love performing. I've always
performed, ever since I was a kid.


1008
01:13:58.539 --> 01:14:02.831
I had no choice. My parents used to
get drunk and dress me up.


1009
01:14:02.956 --> 01:14:05.622
We used to have these African nights.

1010
01:14:05.747 --> 01:14:07.664
Mum would take all my clothes off,

1011
01:14:07.789 --> 01:14:11.372
get a lettuce leaf and a bit of string
and wrap it around here.


1012
01:14:11.497 --> 01:14:14.206
'Do the dance.' 'Righto.'

1013
01:14:16.372 --> 01:14:18.456
But I don't like watching performers.

1014
01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:21.372
I went and saw a country singer
the other day, and they shit me.


1015
01:14:21.497 --> 01:14:23.122
Before every song, he'd say,

1016
01:14:23.247 --> 01:14:27.122
'It's a beautiful song, and
it goes a little something like this.'


1017
01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:31.622
I feel like saying, 'Mate,
just play it exactly the way it goes.


1018
01:14:31.747 --> 01:14:34.914
How long have you been playing
that song, and you haven't nailed it?


1019
01:14:35.039 --> 01:14:38.914
You should say, "It's a beautiful song,
and it goes exactly like this."'


1020
01:14:42.456 --> 01:14:47.664
I don't know what 'wrong' is.
It's a funny thing, wrong.


1021
01:14:47.789 --> 01:14:50.331
What's wrong?

1022
01:14:50.456 --> 01:14:53.914
Washing your tea towels
with your underwear?


1023
01:14:56.914 --> 01:15:00.497
I mean, it all gets in the mix.
The soap powder washes it out,


1024
01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:03.289
but it just feels like
I'm drying the dishes with my bum.


1025
01:15:06.914 --> 01:15:08.789
Yeah, but anyway.

1026
01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:10.539
My dad was very precise, you know?

1027
01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:15.331
He said, 'Listen, son,
don't use this in life, use this, '


1028
01:15:15.456 --> 01:15:18.289
which I took to mean,
don't hit people, headbutt them.


1029
01:15:25.664 --> 01:15:28.206
<i>When I was a kid,
walking into the lounge...</i>


1030
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:32.164
- You alright there?
- Yeah. Go ahead, I'll catch up.


1031
01:15:32.289 --> 01:15:34.414
<i>I was eight.</i>

1032
01:15:37.414 --> 01:15:41.164
<i>When I was a kid,
I was having a bath once.</i>


1033
01:15:45.831 --> 01:15:48.539
I must have done something wrong...

1034
01:15:50.289 --> 01:15:51.789
'cause Dad...

1035
01:15:54.456 --> 01:15:55.956
Dad came in...

1036
01:16:08.622 --> 01:16:11.206
Come on, son. Spit it out!

1037
01:16:21.289 --> 01:16:23.956
People always ask me about the stuff
I do about Dad.


1038
01:16:24.081 --> 01:16:27.497
They say,
'Your father sounds like a hard man.'


1039
01:16:27.622 --> 01:16:30.706
He's probably not as hard as
I make out he is.


1040
01:16:30.831 --> 01:16:32.331
I do love him.

1041
01:16:33.706 --> 01:16:36.581
I probably should leave him alone
for awhile.


1042
01:16:37.747 --> 01:16:39.247
How am I doing, Dad?

1043
01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:43.581
Proud of you, son.

1044
01:16:49.247 --> 01:16:51.247
I'm proud of him.

1045
01:16:51.372 --> 01:16:54.622
Except for the time that
he shit his pants.


1046
01:16:55.831 --> 01:16:57.372
He's making that up.

1047
01:16:59.914 --> 01:17:02.706
I threatened to tell Mum for years...

1048
01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:07.747
but she was doing the same.

1049
01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:13.831
I'd like to sing a song now,
dedicated to a girl.


1050
01:17:13.956 --> 01:17:15.997

Here's to a fantastic performance
and a brilliant career.


1073
01:19:50.289 --> 01:19:54.331
I'm going to make your son a star
in America.


1074
01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.122
He's already a star.

1075
01:19:56.247 --> 01:19:58.664
- He certainly is, sir.
- I know.


1076
01:19:58.789 --> 01:20:00.831
OK.

1077
01:20:03.164 --> 01:20:04.664
Sa'ude!

1078

We're all very happy.
It's going to be a great adventure.

This is for you to sign.

1082
01:20:18.206 --> 01:20:19.706
Thanks, mate.

1083
01:20:27.664 --> 01:20:32.122
It's, ah, it's everything
we agreed upon, mate. It's fine.


1084
01:20:38.997 --> 01:20:40.497
You cool?

1085
01:20:41.789 --> 01:20:43.497
Yeah.

1086
01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:50.622
Just give me a minute, mate.

1087
01:20:53.956 --> 01:20:55.956
I'll just go have a word.

1088
01:20:56.081 --> 01:20:57.581
Let me, Jimmy.

1089
01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.122
We got a problem?

1090
01:21:03.122 --> 01:21:05.997
No, Joel.
I think it's just a bit of cold feet.


1091
01:21:06.122 --> 01:21:07.622
Maria!

1092
01:21:36.789 --> 01:21:38.497
I don't feel good, Dad.

1093
01:21:41.539 --> 01:21:43.039
Listen, son...

1094
01:21:44.872 --> 01:21:47.456
I never did much right in my life.

1095
01:21:48.872 --> 01:21:51.622
Could have been a better father...

1096
01:21:51.747 --> 01:21:53.247
better husband.

1097
01:21:53.372 --> 01:21:55.789
But one thing I can be proud of...

1098
01:21:57.872 --> 01:22:00.914
the day I told your mother
I loved her.


1099
01:22:02.081 --> 01:22:03.956
I was scared!

1100
01:22:04.081 --> 01:22:06.164
I thought she'd laugh at me.

1101
01:22:07.664 --> 01:22:10.039
It was the best thing I ever did.

1102
01:22:10.164 --> 01:22:12.706
It gave me everything I have.

1103
01:22:14.956 --> 01:22:16.497
All I'm saying is...

1104
01:22:18.831 --> 01:22:20.622
don't be afraid, son.

1105
01:22:21.997 --> 01:22:23.497
Don't be afraid.

1106
01:22:27.497 --> 01:22:28.997
Thanks, Dad.

1107
01:22:56.789 --> 01:22:59.164
Is everything alright, Jimmy?

1108
01:22:59.289 --> 01:23:01.747
Oh, everything's fine, Joel.

1109
01:23:01.872 --> 01:23:03.497
Let me buy you a drink.

1110
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:15.289
Cruising Yacht Club, thanks, mate.

1111
01:23:54.456 --> 01:23:55.956
Maria!

1112
01:23:57.372 --> 01:23:58.872
Maria!

1113
01:24:00.206 --> 01:24:01.706
Maria!

1114
01:24:08.997 --> 01:24:10.497
I love you.

1115
01:24:12.122 --> 01:24:13.622
I love you!

1116
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:17.081
