00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:15.225
♫ All to Jesus

2
00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.787
♫ I surrender

3
00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:21.370
♫ All to him I freely give

4
00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.801
♫ I will ever

5
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.326
♫ Love and trust him

6
00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:32.076
♫ In his presence daily live

7
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.143
♫ I surrender all

8
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.632
♫ I surrender all

9
00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:48.297
♫ All to thee my blessed savior

10
00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.000
♫ I surrender all

11
00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:03.149
- Satan wears lots of
disguises, doesn't he?


12
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.706
He wears disguises of friendship,

13
00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:08.768
of lustful thoughts,

14
00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.518
of drugs and alcohol.

15
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:16.698
He disguises himself as
things that make us feel good


16
00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:19.802
to make it easier for us to sin.

17
00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:22.149
Isn't that nice of him?

18
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.065
He wants to make it easy for us.

19
00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:26.565
Today of all days

20
00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:31.497
we must work together to stay alert.

21
00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:35.861
We must become a neighborhood watch

22
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.790
on the look out for Satan,

23
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.873
and we must let Jesus
Christ be our watch leader.


24
00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.982
For as Peter says,

25
00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:47.065
"Be sober, be vigilante,

26
00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.657
"for our adversary the devil

27
00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:53.303
"as a roaring lion walketh about

28
00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:55.803
"seeking whom he may devour",

29
00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:00.072
and whom does he want to devour?

30
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.234
Our children.

31
00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:12.189
For Satan is a pedophile,
brothers and sisters.


32
00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:18.737
Tonight he will be roaming
free in our neighborhoods


33
00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.644
luring our children into the shadows

34
00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:23.399
with the promise of candy

35
00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.824
forcing his burning darkness upon them

36
00:02:25.824 --> 00:02:29.732
and desecrating their
innocence from the inside out.


37
00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.315
We must pray for the children,

38
00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.085
and we must pray for each other

39
00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.585
for we are all God's children.

40
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.566
God doesn't want us to hide
behind masks and costumes.


41
00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:50.529
He wants us to find
our own greater truths.


42
00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.946
That is what a revelation is.

43
00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.799
It is a revealing of his truth.

44
00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.830
I want you to grab the hand

45
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.663
of the person sitting next to you.

46
00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.318
Feel that you are not alone.

47
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.300
Let God touch you.

48
00:03:12.554 --> 00:03:14.221
Let him protect you.

49
00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:17.758
Let him reveal himself to you.

50
00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:21.354
Can you feel him?

51
00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:23.437
Let us all bow our heads.

52
00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:27.996
All of those amongst us

53
00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:31.653
who are so moved by the heavenly spirit

54
00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:33.490
raise up your hands

55
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.334
and show the Lord that you are ready

56
00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:38.584
and willing to receive him.

57
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.977
If you want to
be protected by his light,

58
00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:45.624
guided by his power,

59
00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:49.821
saved with his redeeming
blood in your veins,


60
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.627
I invite you to come forward

61
00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:54.213
to kneel before the congregation

62
00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:57.213
and to accept Christ as your savior.

63
00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.428
(dog barking)

64
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.153
You gonna eat that?

65
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.967
Dude, I was kidding.

66
00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:37.911
No, you can have it
I don't even want it.

67
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:40.744
I just didn't wanna throw it away.

68
00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:47.159
- You know plain donuts
really are the worst.


69
00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.298
It's like just bread.

70
00:04:49.298 --> 00:04:50.879
- Actually that was a powdered one,

71
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.879
but I licked the entire thing first.

72
00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:00.769
- Oh, okay seriously.
- No, no, stop, stop.


73
00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:07.925
- Do you give up?
- Yes, yes.


74
00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:12.725
- Ascencion, I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:15.808
I didn't realize you were still here.

76
00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:20.486
- (gasping) Help me.

77
00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:27.626
- Talk to me, Ascencion.

78
00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:30.954
What does the demon do to you?

79
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:34.165
(woman gasping)

80
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:36.579
What does the demon do to you?

81
00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.329
(woman gasping)

82
00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.024
I want you to see Jesus
holding out his arms to you.


83
00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:50.089
I need you to go to him now.

84
00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.530
Alright I need you
to go be with him.

85
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.012
I need you to go be with him.

86
00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:55.850
Go be safe with Jesus,

87
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.600
and leave the demon here with us.

88
00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:02.157
(woman screaming)

89
00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:04.080
I'm speaking to the demon now.

90
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.952
(woman screaming)

91
00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:08.542
We call upon Jesus to banish the demons

92
00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:11.482
of violence and anger from this body.

93
00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:12.891
(woman mumbling)

94
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:15.824
We lift this inferior curse.

95
00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:18.964
I will leave this body
and return to the pit.


96
00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:19.797
Say it.

97
00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:24.818
(woman screaming)
(tense music)


98
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:29.582
I will leave this body and
return to the pit say it.


99
00:06:29.582 --> 00:06:34.067
I will leave this body say it.

100
00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:35.166
Say it.

101
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.328
Say it.

102
00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.128
I will leave this body.

103
00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.942
I will leave this body.

104
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:42.402
I will leave this body say it.

105
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.977
(woman gasping)

106
00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:48.065
I will return to the pit.

107
00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:49.143
I will return to the pit.

108
00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:51.393
- I will return to the pit.

109
00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:54.723
- I will return to the pit.

110
00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:56.973
- I will return to the pit.

111
00:06:57.827 --> 00:07:00.744
(heavy breathing)

112
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.976
- Jordan, I would like for
you to lead us in a prayer.


113
00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:26.022
- Blessed and eternal God our Father,

114
00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:31.623
we ask for protection for our friend

115
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:36.406
and neighbor Ascencion.

116
00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:39.468
Jesus sees that she's one of his children

117
00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:43.645
who's been blinded by
the worldly darkness.


118
00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:46.395
He offers her his guiding hands,

119
00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:48.833
his strong arms,

120
00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:52.599
his divine love to lift her up

121
00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:57.037
and walk beside him in the light.

122
00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:00.535
Amen.

123
00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:06.439
(dramatic music)

124
00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:22.111
- I wonder why we haven't
had any tricker treaters.


125
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:24.325
We still have like a
hundred tracts to give out.


126
00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:25.783
- Maybe the kids are scared to go--

127
00:08:25.783 --> 00:08:28.072
- Guys, I talked to Pastor Tim today.

128
00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.115
He wanted me to tell everyone

129
00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:31.734
that he thinks we're
doing a really great job,


130
00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:34.234
and he's super excited for us.

131
00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:38.011
Guys, this is our first baptism.

132
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.584
How cool is that?

133
00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:41.667
- Super cool.

134
00:08:47.229 --> 00:08:48.062
- Kara,

135
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.004
- What.

136
00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:52.253
- What's up?

137
00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:58.206
- Nothing.

138
00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:01.112
- Kara, come on.

139
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.100
- Okay, that tattoo that eye thing

140
00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:08.821
it's from Martkedejos.

141
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:10.226
- [Eli] Kedhos.

142
00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:12.023
- What tattoo?

143
00:09:12.023 --> 00:09:14.405
- The one on
the back of Ascencion's neck.

144
00:09:14.405 --> 00:09:16.485
It's from Markedehos.

145
00:09:16.485 --> 00:09:19.029
They're a gang and
they're super dangerous.


146
00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:20.703
They kill people with machetes,

147
00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:24.590
and their hand sign thing
is like devil horns.


148
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.157
There was this article in the Times.

149
00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:27.324
- Wow, really.

150
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.826
- Yeah, there was this story where they

151
00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.340
kidnapped this teenage girl,

152
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.461
and they made her to be
a prostitute for them.


153
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:37.667
They wouldn't give her any condoms,

154
00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:41.896
and then they killed her
for giving someone an STD.


155
00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:43.146
- That's crazy.

156
00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.695
- Yeah, and then they cut
her body into little pieces,


157
00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:47.966
and they sold her organs.

158
00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:49.017
They ate parts of her,

159
00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:51.299
and they threw the rest into the canyon.

160
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.576
The reason that the cops identified her

161
00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:53.564
was because they found her teeth

162
00:09:53.564 --> 00:09:54.637
in the dumpster.
- Kara, are you having doubts


163
00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:56.447
about the baptism?

164
00:09:56.447 --> 00:09:57.280
- No.

165
00:09:59.377 --> 00:10:02.960
I just think that we
should think about it.


166
00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:06.652
- Okay, let's think about it.

167
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.042
Jordan, thoughts?

168
00:10:14.642 --> 00:10:17.559
- I think that
we all came here to

169
00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:22.215
share Christ's love in an area

170
00:10:22.215 --> 00:10:24.382
that has high need for it.

171
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:30.968
I think that someone like
that has the highest need.


172
00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:33.639
- Exactly.

173
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:36.306
I mean that's the core foundation

174
00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:38.325
of the neighboring strategy.

175
00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:39.531
- I know.

176
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:42.714
I'm not saying that we shouldn't help her.

177
00:10:42.714 --> 00:10:45.099
I'm just saying that we
should think about it.


178
00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.932
They're a lot of factors you know.

179
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.544
- What sort of factors?

180
00:10:50.544 --> 00:10:53.179
- Like the factor that she
could kill us with a machete.


181
00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:55.589
- [Eli] Lindsey, that's not helping.

182
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.033
- I mean what does the mission
office say about gangs?


183
00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:01.033
Like is there a policy or something?

184
00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:06.070
I mean like what did your dad
say when you talked to him?


185
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.041
- Well, you can call Pastor
Tim back if you like.


186
00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:13.208
- I thing it's awesome that
she wants to get baptized.


187
00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:16.459
We should get those balloons,

188
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:18.938
you know the white ones,

189
00:11:18.938 --> 00:11:20.579
the little white ones
down at the liquor store.


190
00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.112
I'm sure we could like color them somehow.

191
00:11:23.112 --> 00:11:24.195
(doorbell ringing)

192
00:11:24.195 --> 00:11:25.888
Tricker treaters.

193
00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:26.721
Oh, my god.

194
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:28.600
- Gosh darn it, guys.

195
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.862
Did someone leave the
George Foreman on again?


196
00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:32.712
- [Jordan] I think I might have.

197
00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:35.462
- [Eli] Guys, we
have to be super careful

198
00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:37.496
with the breakers in this house.

199
00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.925
It's an old house.

200
00:11:38.925 --> 00:11:40.675
- [Jordan] I'm sorry.

201
00:11:42.358 --> 00:11:44.836
- [Eli] The doorbell
probably over loaded it.


202
00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:48.336
- Yeah, I'll go
flip the breaker at least.

203
00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:56.998
(lively music)

204
00:11:58.107 --> 00:11:59.808
- [Television Character]
It's like a dream or a song.


205
00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:01.586
It feels like something beautiful,

206
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:03.630
but you can't hold it in your hand.

207
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.380
Should that make it be less real?

208
00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:14.124
(glass breaking)

209
00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:16.685
(tires screeching)
- Guys on the floor.


210
00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:19.150
(tires screeching)

211
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.425
(dog barking)

212
00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:23.993
(dramatic music)

213
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:28.160
(television character singing faintly)

214
00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:36.831
(soft buzzing)

215
00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:38.081
- What is that?

216
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.923
- Pipes.

217
00:12:46.538 --> 00:12:49.656
- Sounds like they're gonna explode.

218
00:12:49.656 --> 00:12:52.156
(dog barking)

219
00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.186
- They're old pipes.

220
00:12:56.916 --> 00:12:59.916
(car horn honking)

221
00:13:03.877 --> 00:13:05.710
- Should we get a gun?

222
00:13:07.334 --> 00:13:10.127
- You wanna shoot the pipes?

223
00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:11.294
- [Jordan] No.

224
00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:16.937
- [Eli] No, I don't think
we should get a gun.


225
00:13:16.937 --> 00:13:18.814
- It was a stupid idea I guess.

226
00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:20.986
- You only get
shot if you're a gangster.

227
00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:22.612
- Yeah.

228
00:13:22.612 --> 00:13:23.779
Yeah, totally.

229
00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:31.185
Why do you think--
- Hey, hold on.


230
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.958
I was getting tired of
talking to your feet.


231
00:13:41.823 --> 00:13:44.490
- I forgot what I was gonna say.

232
00:13:45.823 --> 00:13:48.352
- You know Ascencion really likes you.

233
00:13:48.352 --> 00:13:50.435
- What, what do you mean?

234
00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:52.848
- Yeah.

235
00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:55.109
She was really moved by that
prayer you said for her.


236
00:13:55.109 --> 00:13:58.442
- No, no that was nothing.

237
00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:03.342
- Seriously I mean getting
through to someone like that


238
00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.675
it's a big deal.

239
00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:07.711
I don't just mean from the gang aspect,

240
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:12.368
but when you think about like
the voodoo and the witchcraft


241
00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:16.489
and the blood sacrifice that's
in a generational history


242
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:21.251
I mean that's power stuff
that you're doing battle with.


243
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.240
- Yeah, but I mean you're the
one that did all the work.


244
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.407
You're the one that really helped her.

245
00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.242
- Yeah, you're right.

246
00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:33.068
She probably just thinks
you're cute or something.


247
00:14:33.068 --> 00:14:35.747
- (laughing) Shut up.

248
00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:36.786
- [Eli] Night, buddy.

249
00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:37.619
- Night.

250
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.010
(car horn honking)

251
00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:04.137
(dramatic music)

252
00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:03.295
- [Kara] Guys, guys wake up.

253
00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.955
- What's going on?

254
00:16:04.955 --> 00:16:06.955
- [Jordan] I don't know.

255
00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:25.154
- We got robed.

256
00:16:26.022 --> 00:16:28.960
- Oh, my gosh do you think that
they're still in the house?


257
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.781
- They took the folding chairs

258
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.741
and the computer and my phone.

259
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:35.491
- Heck, the keyboard.

260
00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:38.600
Dude, I am so sorry.

261
00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:43.167
- I mean seriously they took my phone.

262
00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:45.653
What if they call my mom?

263
00:16:45.653 --> 00:16:47.102
- Why would they call your mom?

264
00:16:47.102 --> 00:16:50.576
- I don't know to
say dirty stuff to her.

265
00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:53.031
- What are we going to do?

266
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:54.881
- Call the police.

267
00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.246
- No, that's a bad idea.

268
00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:57.218
- Why?

269
00:16:57.218 --> 00:17:01.150
- Because then we'd have a
cop car in front of the house.


270
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.480
- If there's a cop car
in front of the house,


271
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.956
then no one in the
neighborhood's gonna trust us.


272
00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:06.238
- Yeah.

273
00:17:06.238 --> 00:17:08.118
We need them to trust us.

274
00:17:08.118 --> 00:17:09.043
We can't have them thinking

275
00:17:09.043 --> 00:17:11.677
we're gonna call a cop every 10 minutes.

276
00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:12.918
We don't wanna be outsiders.

277
00:17:12.918 --> 00:17:14.807
- They already think we're outsiders.

278
00:17:14.807 --> 00:17:17.311
They freaking robbed us.

279
00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:18.671
We're being targeted.

280
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.938
- Why would they be targeting us.

281
00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.147
I mean all we've done is
give these people food


282
00:17:22.147 --> 00:17:23.107
and prayed for them.

283
00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:24.284
I mean ungrateful can you--.

284
00:17:24.284 --> 00:17:28.330
- Ladies, listen to me
for one moment all right.


285
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.497
We are not being targeted.

286
00:17:31.793 --> 00:17:33.631
This is what's called
a crime of opportunity.


287
00:17:33.631 --> 00:17:35.979
We learned about this.

288
00:17:35.979 --> 00:17:37.340
Alright we should've boarded up the window

289
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.423
right after the drive by case closed.

290
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.206
This is an opportunity.

291
00:17:44.206 --> 00:17:45.774
God is providing us with the chance

292
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:49.419
to be better prepared next time that's it.

293
00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:50.586
- Eli's right.

294
00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:53.224
(woman gasping)

295
00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:54.696
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?


296
00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.805
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.


297
00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:58.464
- That.

298
00:17:58.464 --> 00:18:01.047
(tense music)

299
00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:18.045
- Can you hold this?

300
00:18:18.045 --> 00:18:19.878
- [Jordan] Yeah, sure.

301
00:18:22.117 --> 00:18:22.950
- Got it?

302
00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:25.220
- Yeah, yeah.

303
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.853
(dramatic music)

304
00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:37.239
- Sorry.

305
00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.739
- No, you're fine.

306
00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:05.660
- Careful I don't wanna get your hand.

307
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.493
(Jordan mumbling)

308
00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:18.316
I don't think you
have to hold it anymore.

309
00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:19.399
- Yeah, yeah.

310
00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:22.795
- Think I got a splinter.

311
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.358
- Oh, no.

312
00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:27.108
Do you want me
to try and get it?

313
00:19:32.098 --> 00:19:34.589
- Dude, where'd you get this?

314
00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:37.019
- I won it at MTYC,

315
00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:39.651
the frisbee golf thing.

316
00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:42.416
- Shot that's right frolf champ '08.

317
00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:44.377
- [Jordan] You know it.

318
00:19:44.377 --> 00:19:48.789
♫ We are marching
in the light of Jesus

319
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:50.502
♫ Marching in the light of God

320
00:19:50.502 --> 00:19:53.305
- Dude, please tell me you
still have that hackie sack?


321
00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:55.539
- No, no I
kicked it into the river

322
00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:58.274
'cause I'm super coordinated.

323
00:19:58.274 --> 00:20:00.365
- That's a bummer I was gonna
say we should play right now.


324
00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.198
- I know.

325
00:20:02.054 --> 00:20:03.036
- Here.

326
00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.786
- Okay, let's see it.

327
00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:08.804
Oh, yeah, yeah there it is.

328
00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:10.399
- Think you can get it?

329
00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:13.816
- I don't know
it's in there pretty deep.

330
00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:15.675
- Come on.

331
00:20:16.563 --> 00:20:18.396
Use that frolf spirit.

332
00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:23.149
Dude, you would make a terrible surgeon.

333
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:25.649
Look how shaky your hands are.

334
00:20:29.586 --> 00:20:32.597
- [Jordan] Yeah, yeah there it is.

335
00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:33.430
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.


336
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.752
- Okay.
- Hold on to it.


337
00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:35.585
- Yep.

338
00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:37.754
Dang,

339
00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:40.095
that's a big one.

340
00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:54.931
(dramatic music)

341
00:20:57.834 --> 00:21:02.001
(pulsating heartbeat)
(police siren blaring)


342
00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:19.017
♫ Perfect delight

343
00:21:19.017 --> 00:21:22.289
♫ Visions of rapture

344
00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:25.450
♫ First in my sight

345
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.734
♫ Angels descending

346
00:21:28.734 --> 00:21:32.051
♫ Bring from above

347
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:35.298
♫ Echos of mercy

348
00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:38.701
♫ Whispers of love

349
00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:42.283
♫ This is my story

350
00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:45.579
♫ This is my song

351
00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:48.952
♫ Praising my savior

352
00:21:48.952 --> 00:21:52.533
♫ All the day long

353
00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:55.897
♫ This is my story

354
00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:59.135
♫ This is my song

355
00:21:59.135 --> 00:22:02.439
♫ Praising savior

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:05.356
♫ All the day long

357
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:11.019
- Baptism is not about salvation.

358
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.123
It's not a step
that you have to take

359
00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:17.456
in order to get into Heaven.

360
00:22:18.644 --> 00:22:20.061
It's about trust.

361
00:22:21.826 --> 00:22:22.993
It's a choice.

362
00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:28.395
It's a decision made by someone

363
00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:31.062
of age to have informed consent

364
00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:35.098
making a public profession of faith.

365
00:22:37.403 --> 00:22:40.820
Baptism is not about getting into Heaven.

366
00:22:42.037 --> 00:22:46.865
It's about living for
Jesus Christ here on Earth.


367
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.694
Have you accepted Jesus Christ

368
00:22:48.694 --> 00:22:51.444
as your personal Lord and savior?

369
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.333
- Yes.

370
00:22:54.577 --> 00:22:58.778
- In obedience to our Lord
and savior Jesus Christ


371
00:22:58.778 --> 00:23:01.642
and upon your profession of faith

372
00:23:01.642 --> 00:23:04.176
I baptize you my sister

373
00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:08.343
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.


374
00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:12.988
Buried with him in the
likeness of his death


375
00:23:12.988 --> 00:23:17.155
and raised with him in the
likeness of his resurrection.


376
00:23:27.188 --> 00:23:30.521
(police siren blaring)

377
00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:40.711
Hey, you've room for this one?

378
00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:41.794
- Yeah, yeah.

379
00:23:54.899 --> 00:23:57.657
(soft buzzing)

00:23:57.657 --> 00:24:00.240

♫ Rock on the peaceful shore

384
00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:34.780
♫ There we deeply sing with him

385
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.197
♫ Hoping to rise no more

386
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.617
♫ And the master of the sea

387
00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:48.199
♫ Hearing my terrible cry

388
00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:53.634
♫ From the watchers lifted me

389
00:24:54.882 --> 00:24:57.465
(soft singing)

390
00:25:00.152 --> 00:25:02.735
(tense music)

391
00:25:23.836 --> 00:25:25.003
- Oh, my gosh.

392
00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:30.375
Oh, my god.
- No, no Lindsey.


393
00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:32.000
Lindsey.

394
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.570
Lindsey.

395
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.372
Hey, Lindsey are you okay?

396
00:25:35.372 --> 00:25:36.920
- What's going on?

397
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.857
- I don't know Lindsey was just acting.

398
00:25:38.857 --> 00:25:41.862
She's acting kind of weird so I just

399
00:25:41.862 --> 00:25:42.695
- Lindsey.

400
00:25:43.962 --> 00:25:46.372
Lindsey are you okay?

401
00:25:46.372 --> 00:25:47.539
Can I come in?

402
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.092
- Kara, this is really good.

403
00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:00.925
- Thanks.

404
00:26:03.686 --> 00:26:08.064
- So do you know where you're
gonna go for your MDiv yet?


405
00:26:08.064 --> 00:26:10.591
- I mean Pastor Tim wants me
to go to Southern Evangelical,


406
00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:12.957
but I kind of
wanna go somewhere more new

407
00:26:12.957 --> 00:26:15.721
you know like Veritas or something.

408
00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:18.053
It's a long way off.

409
00:26:18.053 --> 00:26:22.136
- They're doing this really
cool stuff like in Boston where


410
00:26:22.136 --> 00:26:23.476
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.


411
00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:27.643
It's this new Lazarus program
where you take your group


412
00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:33.162
and you put it on really strict
budgets and diets and stuff.


413
00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:38.974
Yeah, and then you just give
the rest of your money away.


414
00:26:38.974 --> 00:26:43.166
It's like this commitment to
fighting poverty kind of stuff.


415
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:46.000
- But I think
poverty is a good thing.

416
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.828
- Poverty is a good thing.

417
00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:50.125
- Yeah, I mean you get too comfortable

418
00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:52.708
you forget that you need Jesus.

419
00:26:53.601 --> 00:26:55.845
I'm not a huge fan of all the

420
00:26:55.845 --> 00:26:59.102
social justice stuff on the east coast.

421
00:26:59.102 --> 00:27:02.522
I mean you go to Heaven
with your teeth fixed great.


422
00:27:02.522 --> 00:27:04.979
Go to hell with your
teeth fixed not to great


423
00:27:04.979 --> 00:27:06.531
you know what I mean?

424
00:27:06.531 --> 00:27:10.114
- Yeah, yeah like it's
not the right focus.


425
00:27:11.264 --> 00:27:13.409
- Yeah, I mean
it's like the old saying

426
00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:15.991
you know you wanna teach people to fish

427
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:17.794
not just give them a fish.

428
00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:20.153
- Yeah, 'cause if you just
give them fish then they just


429
00:27:20.153 --> 00:27:24.320
they just want tartar
sauce (laughing) right?


430
00:27:25.191 --> 00:27:26.024
- Exactly.

431
00:27:27.243 --> 00:27:31.098
Anyway I might go to Russia
next year do discipleship there


432
00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:32.715
you know get some life experience.

433
00:27:32.715 --> 00:27:36.577
- Isn't that kind of dangerous though.

434
00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:39.207
I mean don't they kill
evangelicals in Russia.


435
00:27:39.207 --> 00:27:42.292
- Well, it's super dangerous for sure.

436
00:27:42.292 --> 00:27:45.391
But in a way it's harder to be
a missionary here in America.


437
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:48.547
People hide their demons here.

438
00:27:48.547 --> 00:27:51.540
- I'm gonna get
Lindsey a plate of food.

439
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.749
- But didn't she say she wasn't hungry.

440
00:27:53.749 --> 00:27:55.589
- [Kara] No, I'm just gonna go see.

441
00:27:55.589 --> 00:27:56.740
- I could bring
it to her if you--

442
00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.740
- [Kara] Okay, I got it.

443
00:28:04.135 --> 00:28:07.468
- Tell her we hope she's feeling better.

444
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.303
You know I do like your idea
for the toy drive though.


445
00:28:13.303 --> 00:28:14.392
- Wait.

446
00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:16.072
Wait what did you?

447
00:28:16.072 --> 00:28:17.480
Oh, right.

448
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.706
Yeah the toy drive that
could be fun right?


449
00:28:21.706 --> 00:28:24.599
You had just mentioned the
kids in the neighborhood


450
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.266
and got me thinking.

451
00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.230
- You know,

452
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.466
I think you would make a
really great pastor someday.


453
00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:34.299
- Really.

454
00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:36.501
- [Eli] You should consider it, yeah.

455
00:28:36.501 --> 00:28:40.660
- I don't like to talk in
front of people, like groups.


456
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.020
It really makes me nervous.

457
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.428
- Yeah, but that like makes you

458
00:28:43.428 --> 00:28:44.896
way more approachable to people.

459
00:28:44.896 --> 00:28:47.102
You know, you got this whole like

460
00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:49.852
sort of poet soul thing going on.

461
00:28:58.545 --> 00:28:59.941
Feeling better?

462
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:00.774
- Huh?

463
00:29:06.082 --> 00:29:08.450
Are you feeling better?

464
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.990
- Jordan, I'm going to give you
a chance to explain yourself


465
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.059
before I tell Eli what I saw.

466
00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:16.732
I think that it is your right

467
00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:18.515
and responsibility to this group

468
00:29:18.515 --> 00:29:22.598
and to God to be honest
with all of us right now.


469
00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:24.328
- I don't know what you're

470
00:29:24.328 --> 00:29:26.800
talking about.
- Yes, you do know.


471
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.100
- No, I really, really don't.

472
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.768
- I was walking down the
hallway before dinner,


473
00:29:32.768 --> 00:29:33.957
Eli was in the shower,

474
00:29:33.957 --> 00:29:37.273
and the bathroom door was open.

475
00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:39.059
Jordan was watching Eli through the door

476
00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:41.809
and touching himself.

477
00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:46.073
(nervous laughter)
- What?


478
00:29:46.073 --> 00:29:46.906
Seriously.

479
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:51.999
No, I mean I was in hall, but...

480
00:29:52.954 --> 00:29:57.494
No, I was there to see if
Eli was done in the shower.


481
00:29:57.494 --> 00:30:01.661
I mean we keep the door open
because of the steam issue.


482
00:30:04.463 --> 00:30:06.389
I mean, yeah, I guess I
could see why you would think


483
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:08.806
that I was doing that, but...

484
00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:12.772
Was that why you ran off like that?

485
00:30:12.772 --> 00:30:14.887
- Jordan, denying it is
only making it worse.


486
00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:17.304
I saw you, you were you know.

487
00:30:18.253 --> 00:30:20.923
I would not make this up, okay.

488
00:30:20.923 --> 00:30:23.445
Do you even realize how hard
it is for me to say the words.


489
00:30:23.445 --> 00:30:24.804
I mean how do you think I feel.

490
00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:26.535
- I didn't.
- Honestly, I mean


491
00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:29.036
I'm just sickened by this.

492
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:32.119
Jordan, I'm not trying to attack you.

493
00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:35.187
I care about you.

494
00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:36.020
We all do.

495
00:30:39.713 --> 00:30:40.546
- Jordan,

496
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:45.189
we're all on the same side here.

497
00:30:45.189 --> 00:30:47.939
Just tell us what happened, okay.

498
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.943
- Nothing happened.

499
00:30:54.918 --> 00:30:58.320
(Jordan stammering)

500
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.269
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

501
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:02.686
- The truth.
- Lindsey.


502
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:10.204
Just say yes or no.

503
00:31:12.127 --> 00:31:15.019
- I haven't been feeling well.

504
00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:16.019
- Yes or no.

505
00:31:16.952 --> 00:31:17.971
- I mean I was in the hall--

506
00:31:17.971 --> 00:31:18.971
- Yes or no.

507
00:31:23.746 --> 00:31:24.579
- Yes.

508
00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:30.521
- We should pray.

509
00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:44.730
Blessed and eternal Father,

510
00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:51.995
- Blessed and eternal Father,

511
00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:53.277
we thank you for your power

512
00:31:53.277 --> 00:31:56.016
to deliver us from all bondage.

513
00:31:56.016 --> 00:31:58.638
We pray for Jordan
that he may be released

514
00:31:58.638 --> 00:32:00.949
from this spirit of sexual perversion

515
00:32:00.949 --> 00:32:04.699
and forgiven for his
wicked and vile actions.


516
00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:09.408
We ask that the
fire of the Holy Spirit

517
00:32:09.408 --> 00:32:12.408
purge his soul in the name of Jesus.

518
00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:16.205
- Amen.

519
00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:23.039
Thank you, Lindsey.

520
00:32:36.173 --> 00:32:39.673
(emergency siren blaring)

521
00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:54.583
(pulsating drum beat)

522
00:33:04.214 --> 00:33:06.797
(dogs barking)

523
00:33:33.281 --> 00:33:35.281
- Hey, do you need help?

524
00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:37.256
- I'm good.

525
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.091
There was a dead
rat in here this morning.

526
00:33:42.091 --> 00:33:43.723
- Oh, really.

527
00:33:43.723 --> 00:33:45.662
I didn't even know that
we had rats around here.


528
00:33:45.662 --> 00:33:49.829
I thought they were just like
around the docks and stuff.


529
00:33:52.756 --> 00:33:55.006
I could get another sponge.

530
00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:57.267
- It's okay.

531
00:33:59.143 --> 00:34:01.893
Kind of one person job, you know.

532
00:34:03.468 --> 00:34:04.301
- Yeah.

533
00:34:05.499 --> 00:34:06.916
Yeah, okay, yeah.

534
00:34:29.203 --> 00:34:32.175
Purify my soul from darkness

535
00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:34.272
and deliver me from the
struggles of my sins


536
00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:37.903
from the struggles my sins
have built against me.


537
00:34:37.903 --> 00:34:42.070
I ask that you empower me
with your power and wash me


538
00:34:43.402 --> 00:34:47.569
and wash me in the redeeming
blood of Jesus Christ.


539
00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:06.220
Hey, where is everyone.

540
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.183
- They went shopping for the toy drive.

541
00:35:09.183 --> 00:35:10.850
How are you feeling?

542
00:35:12.023 --> 00:35:12.940
- I'm okay.

543
00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:18.989
- I stayed behind because
I wanted to talk to you.


544
00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:19.822
- Oh.

545
00:35:21.317 --> 00:35:22.150
Oh, okay.

546
00:35:29.154 --> 00:35:31.260
- I wanted to let you know

547
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.325
that I think I understand your problem.

548
00:35:35.325 --> 00:35:36.158
- You do.

549
00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.835
- It's the neighborhood.

550
00:35:41.294 --> 00:35:42.877
- The neighborhood.

551
00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:47.309
- What you're feeling
is Satan's influence.


552
00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:49.342
If we stay here long enough,

553
00:35:49.342 --> 00:35:51.359
he'll enter all of us.

554
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:53.371
So that's why I
think we need to leave.

555
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:55.968
I mean I've given
this a lot of thought,

556
00:35:55.968 --> 00:36:00.135
and I think it's the only
solution that makes sense.


557
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.592
- Have you talked to
anyone else about this?


558
00:36:07.592 --> 00:36:11.478
- No, I wanted
to talk to you first,

559
00:36:11.478 --> 00:36:13.689
so we can go to them together.

560
00:36:13.689 --> 00:36:17.674
They're not gonna listen if it's just me.

561
00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:19.895
- I'm gonna pray on this, okay.

562
00:36:19.895 --> 00:36:20.728
- Okay.

563
00:36:22.808 --> 00:36:24.891
- I'm gonna go for a run.

564
00:36:27.654 --> 00:36:30.075
- Can you get some toilet paper?

565
00:36:30.075 --> 00:36:32.002
I don't wanna go out there.

566
00:36:32.002 --> 00:36:32.835
- Sure.

567
00:36:34.873 --> 00:36:36.373
- And Dr. Skipper.

568
00:36:38.107 --> 00:36:42.190
- Why don't you make a
list of whatever you want


569
00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:45.801
and I'll pick it up for you.

I can feel it.

645
00:43:36.387 --> 00:43:39.397
- You answered the altar call.

646
00:43:39.397 --> 00:43:41.564
You asked for forgiveness.

647
00:43:43.923 --> 00:43:44.926
You're on the right path

just keep doing a good job.

00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:48.591
- In obedience to our Lord
and savior Jesus Christ


660
00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:52.758
and upon your profession of
faith I baptize you my brother


661
00:44:53.923 --> 00:44:55.774
in the name of the Father

662
00:44:55.774 --> 00:44:58.107
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

663
00:45:00.243 --> 00:45:03.910
Buried with him in the
likeness of his death


664
00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:08.536
(dramatic music)

665
00:45:08.536 --> 00:45:11.369
(women giggling)

666
00:45:12.828 --> 00:45:16.995
and raised with him in the
likeness of his resurrection.


667
00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:24.372
So the guy's in trouble, right.

668
00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:26.209
He's runaway from home.

669
00:45:26.209 --> 00:45:28.020
He's partied with the gentiles.

670
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.399
He spent all of his father's
money and gone broke,


671
00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:33.062
so what does he do next?

672
00:45:33.062 --> 00:45:34.562
He goes
- He goes.


673
00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:38.276
- He goes to
a farm to feed pigs,

674
00:45:38.276 --> 00:45:40.730
and in the first century
Greco-Roman culture


675
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.385
Jewish people are
forbidden from eating pork


676
00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:45.648
because pigs are considered unclean.

677
00:45:45.648 --> 00:45:48.873
So that's just a little
bit of historical context.


678
00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:52.266
It basically makes what
he does one of the lowest


679
00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:55.814
most degrading things that
someone in his position could do.


680
00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:57.445
- But do you think he
thinks it's degrading,


681
00:45:57.445 --> 00:45:59.003
or is it something--
- Worse than that


682
00:45:59.003 --> 00:46:00.680
worse than going to this farm

683
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.384
to work with these unclean animals

684
00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:03.514
what happens in the next verse

685
00:46:03.514 --> 00:46:06.038
when he actually goes to feeds the pigs?

686
00:46:06.038 --> 00:46:09.171
- He longs for
what the pigs are eating.

687
00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:10.882
- He longs for it.

688
00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:12.598
He yearns for it.

689
00:46:12.598 --> 00:46:16.175
He craves this slop.

690
00:46:16.175 --> 00:46:19.866
- What exactly is in first century slop?

691
00:46:19.866 --> 00:46:20.699
- What?

692
00:46:27.171 --> 00:46:29.060
- Just for historical context

693
00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.009
I was just wondering what exactly is in

694
00:46:32.009 --> 00:46:35.111
first century Greco
-Roman slop?

695
00:46:35.111 --> 00:46:39.278
- Yeah, I don't know what's
in first century slop.


696
00:46:41.908 --> 00:46:44.158
- Okay, I was just curious.

697
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:53.711
- If you have an issue
Jordan we can all discuss it.


698
00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:55.461
This is a safe space.

699
00:46:56.945 --> 00:46:58.945
- I don't have an issue.

700
00:47:00.132 --> 00:47:01.965
- Okay, see well I do.

701
00:47:02.917 --> 00:47:04.819
I have an issue with you intentionally

702
00:47:04.819 --> 00:47:06.643
derailing the study group.

703
00:47:06.643 --> 00:47:09.709
I think that all of our
time would be best served


704
00:47:09.709 --> 00:47:11.184
if you went elsewhere to practice some

705
00:47:11.184 --> 00:47:12.841
quiet contemplation on your own.

706
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:14.204
- Are you giving me a time out?

707
00:47:14.204 --> 00:47:17.070
- I am making a recommendation.

708
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.903
(dramatic music)

709
00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:33.319
♫ Blessed assurance Jesus is mine

710
00:47:34.265 --> 00:47:38.432
♫ O' what a foretaste of glory divine

711
00:47:39.981 --> 00:47:42.981
♫ Heir of salvation

712
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:01.859
- [Kara] You're packing.

713
00:48:01.859 --> 00:48:02.692
- Yeah.

714
00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:05.298
- Should I pack?

715
00:48:06.249 --> 00:48:07.511
- I don't know, Kara.

716
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:10.844
I think you should do whatever you want.

717
00:48:15.824 --> 00:48:18.560
- Jordan and I were just talking about

718
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.893
if I should do potato salad or coleslaw.

719
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:27.052
- Potato salad, right?

720
00:48:27.052 --> 00:48:28.552
It's more filling.

721
00:48:39.757 --> 00:48:40.590
Hey.

722
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:42.913
Stop packing.

723
00:48:49.222 --> 00:48:50.972
Come and sit with me.

724
00:49:03.297 --> 00:49:04.130
Man,

725
00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:08.109
I've been a horrible friend.

726
00:49:12.752 --> 00:49:13.782
You're going through hell

727
00:49:13.782 --> 00:49:17.115
and I haven't been
there for you at all.

728
00:49:18.434 --> 00:49:23.248
- I wouldn't wanna be around
me either if I was you.


729
00:49:23.248 --> 00:49:24.415
I'm a pervert.

730
00:49:25.328 --> 00:49:26.161
- No.

731
00:49:28.212 --> 00:49:31.986
You're someone who's asking for help.

732
00:49:31.986 --> 00:49:36.121
I haven't been strong
enough to give that to you,


733
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:37.204
but I am now.

734
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.160
- I don't think you can.

735
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.637
- [Eli] I'm willing
to try if you are.

736
00:49:49.711 --> 00:49:50.544
- How?

737
00:49:53.774 --> 00:49:55.524
- Tell me everything.

738
00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.490
- What do you mean?

739
00:50:01.303 --> 00:50:03.239
- How it started?

740
00:50:03.239 --> 00:50:04.489
What it's like?

741
00:50:05.331 --> 00:50:06.498
Every thought.

742
00:50:08.716 --> 00:50:11.716
Look I know this is kind of awkward.

743
00:50:14.519 --> 00:50:18.546
Honestly this is how I
would counsel anyone.


744
00:50:18.546 --> 00:50:22.046
We'll just pretend that it's not about me.

745
00:50:24.097 --> 00:50:26.097
Really I'm cool with it.

746
00:50:30.734 --> 00:50:34.901
- Yeah, I'm not really sure
how to answer that question.


747
00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:37.338
- Just tell me when you started

748
00:50:37.338 --> 00:50:40.088
noticing feeling stuff like this.

749
00:50:45.147 --> 00:50:47.230
- I don't know it's just

750
00:50:48.272 --> 00:50:51.855
random thoughts will
just pop into my head.


751
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.350
It's like they're not even my thoughts.

752
00:51:02.095 --> 00:51:05.178
- What kind of thoughts specifically?

753
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:11.498
- No, it's not like I wanna
act on them or anything.


754
00:51:11.498 --> 00:51:16.038
It's not like I even feel
that way about men in general.


755
00:51:16.038 --> 00:51:18.121
It's just when I think...

756
00:51:20.248 --> 00:51:22.665
Like when it's more specific.

757
00:51:24.302 --> 00:51:26.152
- I mean that's great.

758
00:51:26.152 --> 00:51:27.880
I mean you just said you don't wanna

759
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.713
act on it and that is
the most important part.


760
00:51:32.838 --> 00:51:36.023
What concerns me is that you said

761
00:51:36.023 --> 00:51:39.579
these thoughts don't feel like your own.

762
00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:41.829
Do you mean that literally?

763
00:51:47.327 --> 00:51:48.160
- Yeah.

764
00:51:49.018 --> 00:51:50.435
Yeah, I think so.

765
00:51:51.457 --> 00:51:55.040
It's like I can't even
control them at all.


766
00:51:55.988 --> 00:51:59.738
- Do you feel sick in your stomach?

767
00:52:01.076 --> 00:52:02.243
You can't eat?

768
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:07.120
How's your sleep?

769
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.037
- Terrible.

770
00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:12.343
- Do you hear voices?

771
00:52:15.703 --> 00:52:16.536
- Maybe.

772
00:52:18.482 --> 00:52:19.500
I think so.

773
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.333
- May I?

774
00:52:21.343 --> 00:52:22.760
- [Jordan] Yeah.

775
00:52:26.753 --> 00:52:29.836
- I've never told anyone this before.

776
00:52:32.867 --> 00:52:34.784
When my sister was 13,

777
00:52:35.728 --> 00:52:37.728
she manifested a demon,

778
00:52:39.413 --> 00:52:41.246
a really powerful one.

779
00:52:42.246 --> 00:52:43.079
- She did.

780
00:52:45.674 --> 00:52:49.841
- I won some goldfish at
the fair and we came home.


781
00:52:52.188 --> 00:52:55.412
She took them out of my tank

782
00:52:55.412 --> 00:52:58.639
and put them on the window sill.

783
00:52:58.639 --> 00:53:02.472
She made me watch as
they suffocated to death.


784
00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.799
Your heartbeat's really fast.

785
00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:10.314
- So what happened?

786
00:53:15.937 --> 00:53:18.020
- She started hurting me.

787
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.440
I didn't tell anyone about it.

788
00:53:26.019 --> 00:53:29.335
Eventually she took a hockey stick,

789
00:53:29.335 --> 00:53:32.394
and she hit me in the face.

790
00:53:32.394 --> 00:53:34.477
She knocked out my teeth.

791
00:53:36.531 --> 00:53:38.120
That was when Pastor Tim realized

792
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.453
that she had manifested a demon of rage.

793
00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:47.666
They performed a deliverance on her,

794
00:53:49.649 --> 00:53:51.982
and they cast the demon out.

795
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:56.931
She went back to
normal for the most part.

796
00:54:00.881 --> 00:54:03.214
- You're kind of scaring me.

797
00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:08.096
- I don't wanna scare you.

798
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.367
I wanna help you.

799
00:54:28.907 --> 00:54:30.880
- Always night and day
he was in the mountains


800
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.062
and in the tombs crying and
cutting himself with stones,


801
00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:37.292
but when he saw Jesus afar
off he ran and worshiped him


802
00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:38.790
and cried with a loud voice and said,

803
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:40.471
"What have I to do with thee, Jesus

804
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:42.565
"the Son of the Most High God.

805
00:54:42.565 --> 00:54:46.145
"I adjure thee by God
that thou torment me not."


806
00:54:46.145 --> 00:54:47.344
For he said unto him,

807
00:54:47.344 --> 00:54:51.011
"Come out of the man thou unclean spirit."

808
00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:55.009
The unclean spirits went out
and entered into the swine,


809
00:54:55.009 --> 00:54:58.309
and the herd ran violently down
a steep place into the sea.


810
00:54:58.309 --> 00:55:00.937
There were about 2,000 of them

811
00:55:00.937 --> 00:55:03.187
and were choked in the sea.

812
00:55:04.397 --> 00:55:06.980
(tense music)

813
00:55:11.736 --> 00:55:15.801
They went out to see what
it was that was done.


814
00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:16.796
They came.

815
00:55:16.796 --> 00:55:19.379
They came to Jesus and see him

816
00:55:21.131 --> 00:55:23.883
see he that was possessed with the devil

817
00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:27.033
devil and had the legion sitting

818
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:29.811
and clothed and in his right mind

819
00:55:29.811 --> 00:55:31.561
and they were afraid.

820
00:55:32.972 --> 00:55:35.555
(tense music)

821
00:56:06.021 --> 00:56:09.347
(people laughing)

822
00:56:09.347 --> 00:56:11.930
(tense music)

823
00:56:22.259 --> 00:56:25.009
- Can I get you anything, Pamela?

824
00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:29.630
- They're shooting horses out west.

825
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:30.993
- Excuse me.

826
00:56:30.993 --> 00:56:33.359
- They're over populated out there.

827
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:36.145
They shoot them from the airplanes now.

828
00:56:36.145 --> 00:56:39.395
I think that's terrible, just terrible.

829
00:56:49.986 --> 00:56:52.290
(foreign language spoken)

830
00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:54.027
- This is my friend Blanca.

831
00:56:54.027 --> 00:56:56.109
- Blanca, mucho gusto.

832
00:56:56.109 --> 00:56:58.812
Any friend of Ascencion a friend of ours.

833
00:56:58.812 --> 00:56:59.645
I hope you guys are hungry.

834
00:56:59.645 --> 00:57:02.213
We have some great food.

835
00:57:02.213 --> 00:57:03.796
Where are you from?

836
00:57:06.596 --> 00:57:08.596
Yeah, so we got hotdogs

837
00:57:09.704 --> 00:57:12.871
and I think some hamburgers somewhere.

838
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.614
Hey, buddy.

839
00:57:15.614 --> 00:57:16.791
You okay.

840
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:18.601
- You have to submit.

841
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.836
You have to submit to Jesus.

842
00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.502
You have to allow him to cast out

843
00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:24.797
them out like the pigs off the cliff.

844
00:57:24.797 --> 00:57:28.964
- Hey, Jordan, listen to me
I think Kara needs some help.


845
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.073
- Okay.

846
00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:34.249
Yeah, yeah, yeah okay.

847
00:57:47.966 --> 00:57:50.851
- You should come inside
and lie down for a bit.


848
00:57:50.851 --> 00:57:52.934
You don't look very good.

849
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:56.674
I'll come check on
you in a bit, okay?

850
00:57:56.674 --> 00:58:00.507
I'll bring you some tuna
mac then we can talk.


851
00:58:10.523 --> 00:58:13.550
- So the old lady yells Acts 2:38

852
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:14.645
and the robber freezes.

853
00:58:14.645 --> 00:58:16.780
He stops what he's doing.

854
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.794
The cops get there
and they say to him,

855
00:58:19.794 --> 00:58:21.408
"All the old lady did
was yell a bible verse.


856
00:58:21.408 --> 00:58:23.013
"Why'd you stop?"

857
00:58:23.013 --> 00:58:26.002
He says, "Bible verse I thought she said

858
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:28.966
"she had an ax and two 38s."

859
00:58:28.966 --> 00:58:32.484
(foreign language spoken)

860
00:58:32.484 --> 00:58:35.234
- I would've gotten out of there.

861
00:58:36.084 --> 00:58:39.143
- Okay, so basically Acts 2:38
is a bible verse that says


862
00:58:39.143 --> 00:58:41.441
if you repent and you're baptized

863
00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:44.798
then your sins will be forgiven.

864
00:58:44.798 --> 00:58:48.470
- Then you will receive the
gift of the Holy Spirit.


865
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:49.303
- Exactly.

866
00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:52.191
Anyway we have a ton of leftover food.

867
00:58:52.191 --> 00:58:54.861
I hope you guys
will take some with you.

868
00:58:54.861 --> 00:58:56.847
- No, no we can't.
- I'll give you guys extra


869
00:58:56.847 --> 00:59:01.079
so that you can have some for
the people you live with too.


870
00:59:01.079 --> 00:59:03.727
- It wouldn't be a good idea because

871
00:59:03.727 --> 00:59:06.810
then they will know that we was here.

872
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:13.416
- You know there are safe places.

873
00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.694
People can protect you.

874
00:59:15.694 --> 00:59:16.944
I can help you.

875
00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.304
- You've already helped me.

876
00:59:22.961 --> 00:59:26.414
I used to live
with evil inside of me,

877
00:59:26.414 --> 00:59:29.164
and now I have the love of Jesus.

878
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.000
- I know you do, but

879
00:59:35.188 --> 00:59:39.339
you can't worship Jesus and
live in the devil's house.


880
00:59:39.339 --> 00:59:41.089
You know what I mean?

881
00:59:45.276 --> 00:59:47.176
- [Kara] Jordan.

882
00:59:47.176 --> 00:59:49.676
(tense music)

883
00:59:53.524 --> 00:59:54.691
Are you okay?

884
00:59:58.058 --> 01:00:00.598
(Jordan growling)
(Kara gasping)


885
01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:01.431
- [Lindsey] Kara.

886
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.598
(Jordan muttering foreign dialect)

887
01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.900
(suspenseful music)

888
01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:15.844
- Was that

889
01:00:18.507 --> 01:00:19.340
Spanish?

890
01:00:34.367 --> 01:00:37.284
(Jordan gurgling)

891
01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.038
- Jordan,

892
01:00:44.304 --> 01:00:45.637
can you hear me?

893
01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:01.624
We're gonna get through this.

894
01:01:05.737 --> 01:01:07.320
It's gonna be okay.

895
01:01:12.165 --> 01:01:13.415
I'm right here.

896
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:29.788
(soft buzzing)

897
01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:41.396
(tense music)

898
01:01:42.504 --> 01:01:43.337
Jordan.

899
01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:45.920
(dog barking)

900
01:01:50.593 --> 01:01:53.931
(Jordan gurgling)

901
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:58.098
If there is an evil presence
inside of this body,


902
01:01:59.685 --> 01:02:01.685
I'm speaking to you now.

903
01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:09.359
I'm giving you a warning.

904
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.678
It is in your
best interest to leave now.

905
01:02:14.678 --> 01:02:15.928
Release Jordan.

906
01:02:17.436 --> 01:02:20.269
(Jordan gasping)

907
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.537
Do you hear me, huh?

908
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.504
Do you hear me in there?

909
01:02:28.504 --> 01:02:31.025
- [Jordan] I feel sick.

910
01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:31.858
- Jordan,

911
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.193
leave us.

912
01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:38.568
Go be safe with God.

913
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.230
I wanna speak with the demon now.

914
01:02:44.776 --> 01:02:47.247
Reveal yourself you fag demon.

915
01:02:47.247 --> 01:02:50.080
(Jordan gasping)

916
01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:56.487
I pierce you with God's sword.

917
01:02:59.035 --> 01:03:02.324
You want me so bad
come out and get me.

918
01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:05.845
(Jordan muttering)

919
01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:07.529
What was that?

920
01:03:07.529 --> 01:03:11.696
I can't hear you is your mouth
too full of Satan's penis?


921
01:03:15.705 --> 01:03:16.538
Hey.

922
01:03:24.205 --> 01:03:26.872
Submit yourself therefore to God.

923
01:03:26.872 --> 01:03:29.775
Resist the devil and
he will flee from you.


924
01:03:29.775 --> 01:03:32.714
Draw nigh to God and he
will draw nigh to you.


925
01:03:32.714 --> 01:03:34.808
Cleanse your hands ye sinners,

926
01:03:34.808 --> 01:03:37.774
and purify your hearts ye double minded.

927
01:03:37.774 --> 01:03:40.837
Be afflicted and mourn and weep.

928
01:03:40.837 --> 01:03:43.473
Let your laughter be turned to mourning

929
01:03:43.473 --> 01:03:45.493
and your joy to heaviness.

930
01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:48.150
Humble yourself in the sight of the Lord,

931
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:50.366
and he shall lift you up.

932
01:03:50.366 --> 01:03:52.949
(tense music)

933
01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:22.878
Get off of me.

934
01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:28.417
- Is everything okay?

935
01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.717
I heard shouts when
I was in the kitchen.

936
01:04:33.717 --> 01:04:35.231
I didn't know if

937
01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:37.652
there was something wrong.
- Grab that belt.


938
01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:39.903
You secure his wrists.

939
01:04:39.903 --> 01:04:41.070
I'll hold him.

940
01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.053
Loop it around.

941
01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:49.886
Tighter.

942
01:04:51.431 --> 01:04:52.264
Kara.

943
01:04:53.775 --> 01:04:55.002
That's good.

944
01:04:55.002 --> 01:04:57.169
You can go close the door.

945
01:04:58.554 --> 01:05:01.387
(Jordan gasping)

946
01:05:09.641 --> 01:05:11.141
You're not Jordan.

947
01:05:16.449 --> 01:05:18.324
What's your name?

948
01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:20.017
Look at me.

949
01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.517
What is your name?

950
01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.754
What is your name?

951
01:05:35.313 --> 01:05:37.980
- You look nice tonight, Elijah.

952
01:05:40.013 --> 01:05:42.072
- What is your name?

953
01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.405
- What do you want it to be?

954
01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:47.940
- What authority do you
have over this body?


955
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.773
- None.

956
01:05:50.286 --> 01:05:51.953
I have no authority.

957
01:05:53.455 --> 01:05:55.474
- Then I command you to release Jordan,

958
01:05:55.474 --> 01:05:59.162
and go back to the burning
pits of hell where you belong.


959
01:05:59.162 --> 01:06:00.995
- Good I want to burn.

960
01:06:03.856 --> 01:06:05.803
- You want to leave this body?

961
01:06:05.803 --> 01:06:09.053
- I want you to
come inside and get me.

962
01:06:10.385 --> 01:06:12.135
There's a difference.

963
01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:15.311
- Well, that should be easy.

964
01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:17.906
You're not a very strong demon are you?

965
01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:19.447
- No.

966
01:06:19.447 --> 01:06:20.966
No, I'm not.

967
01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:22.956
I'm powerless

968
01:06:22.956 --> 01:06:25.873
and useless, defenseless, helpless.

969
01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:29.876
- Jesus' love will destroy you.

970
01:06:29.876 --> 01:06:30.709
- Will it.

971
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:33.915
- God is in charge.

972
01:06:33.915 --> 01:06:35.256
- That sounds good.

973
01:06:35.256 --> 01:06:37.729
Play God take charge.

974
01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:41.098
- [Eli] I release Jordan say it.

975
01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:41.931
- No.

976
01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:45.722
- I will receive say it.

977
01:06:51.937 --> 01:06:53.770
I will receive say it.

978
01:06:56.603 --> 01:06:58.252
Say it.

979
01:06:58.252 --> 01:06:59.194
- No.

980
01:06:59.194 --> 01:07:00.611
- I will receive.

981
01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.870
- I will receive.

982
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:05.120
I will receive.

983
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:09.370
- God's judgment say it.

984
01:07:10.935 --> 01:07:11.768
- Make me.

985
01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:15.368
Make me.
- Say it.


986
01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:16.870
- Make me.
- I will


987
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.344
fucking make you.

988
01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:20.927
(tense music)

989
01:07:22.561 --> 01:07:24.394
Is this what you want?

990
01:07:25.524 --> 01:07:29.524
I break your curse of
defilement and perversion.


991
01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.359
I reject Satan's power,

992
01:07:38.359 --> 01:07:42.277
and replace it with the
redeeming blood of Christ.


993
01:07:42.277 --> 01:07:44.971
The Holy Spirit demands it.

994
01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:46.483
Jesus wills it.

995
01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:48.172
God commands it.

996
01:07:48.172 --> 01:07:50.755
(tense music)

997
01:07:58.148 --> 01:07:59.148
Release him.

998
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:03.511
Release Jordan.

999
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.513
- Eli.

1000
01:08:12.117 --> 01:08:12.950
- Jordan.

1001
01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:19.212
(heavy breathing)

1002
01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:50.265
♫ Love lifted me

1003
01:08:53.137 --> 01:08:55.887
♫ Love lifted me

1004
01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:02.676
♫ When nothing else would help

1005
01:09:04.739 --> 01:09:07.489
♫ Love lifted me

1006
01:09:10.548 --> 01:09:13.298
♫ Love lifted me

1007
01:09:16.181 --> 01:09:18.931
♫ Love lifted me

1008
01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:25.751
♫ When nothing else could help

1009
01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:31.416
- [Eli] Hey, tell me the truth.

1010
01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:32.694
- What.

1011
01:09:32.694 --> 01:09:34.264
- I picked the wrong song.

1012
01:09:34.264 --> 01:09:36.517
- What, no way it was perfect.

1013
01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:37.608
- Yeah, but I thought of like

1014
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.689
10 better ones like right after.

1015
01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:42.394
- Stop seriously it was awesome.

1016
01:09:42.394 --> 01:09:45.542
- Hey, have you seen Ascencion?

1017
01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:47.059
She never misses Sunday service.

1018
01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:48.487
I'm a little worried about her.

1019
01:09:48.487 --> 01:09:51.022
- No, when's the last time you talked

1020
01:09:51.022 --> 01:09:53.105
- Someone's following me.

1021
01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.613
- Jesus is following you.

1022
01:09:56.613 --> 01:10:00.037
He follows you to protect
and watch over you.


1023
01:10:00.037 --> 01:10:03.043
Jordan, would you like to lead
us in a prayer for Pamela?


1024
01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:03.876
- Yeah.

1025
01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:15.837
- Good call.

1026
01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:19.623
Getting kind of chubby anyway.

1027
01:10:19.623 --> 01:10:22.837
- You know I was thinking Psalms 28

1028
01:10:22.837 --> 01:10:25.664
would have been a stronger choice.

1029
01:10:25.664 --> 01:10:26.611
- Are you serious.

1030
01:10:26.611 --> 01:10:28.361
- Yeah, or Psalms 68.

1031
01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:31.818
Give us your strength
as you have done before.


1032
01:10:31.818 --> 01:10:32.868
- Are you serious or are you joking.

1033
01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:35.590
- Really any other Psalms would
have been a better choice.


1034
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:37.927
Than the one you chose (laughing).

1035
01:10:37.927 --> 01:10:39.510
Whoa, Eli, stop it.

1036
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.977
Get off me, Eli.
(woman screaming)


1037
01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:47.560
(tense music)

1038
01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:50.515
- I'll call the police.

1039
01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.443
- I'm calling my mom.

1040
01:10:59.443 --> 01:11:00.843
- Why?

1041
01:11:00.843 --> 01:11:02.496
- So she can pick me up.

1042
01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:03.481
I wanna go home.

1043
01:11:03.481 --> 01:11:04.314
- Kara.

1044
01:11:04.314 --> 01:11:06.481
- Someone give me a phone.

1045
01:11:13.216 --> 01:11:14.049
- Okay.

1046
01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:17.228
I understand thank you.

1047
01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:22.910
It's not an actual emergency,

1048
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.723
so if we wanna make a report,

1049
01:11:24.723 --> 01:11:25.705
we have to take some photos

1050
01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:28.578
and go down to the station ourselves.

1051
01:11:28.578 --> 01:11:30.648
- Should we all go together?

1052
01:11:30.648 --> 01:11:33.335
- Maybe someone should stay here.

1053
01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:35.585
- I think we should all go.

1054
01:11:36.429 --> 01:11:37.694
I don't think there's any real danger,

1055
01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:41.204
but it's best to
be on the safe side.

1056
01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:42.537
- My mom's here.

1057
01:12:33.022 --> 01:12:34.189
- Hey, Jordan

1058
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.179
can you go check
my jeans for my keys.

1059
01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.099
I'm gonna snap a few
photos then we can go.


1060
01:12:40.099 --> 01:12:41.182
- Yeah, sure.

1061
01:12:59.005 --> 01:13:00.947
- [Lindsay] I just don't feel
safe with him around anymore.


1062
01:13:00.947 --> 01:13:02.280
I can't help it.

1063
01:13:03.227 --> 01:13:06.310
- Lindsay, I saw the demon leave him.

1064
01:13:07.353 --> 01:13:08.859
He doesn't even remember it happening.

1065
01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:12.740
What's happening right now
has nothing to do with him.


1066
01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.383
- At least tell me that
you're not going to


1067
01:13:14.383 --> 01:13:16.288
share a bed with him again.

1068
01:13:16.288 --> 01:13:18.177
- What does that
have to do with anything?

1069
01:13:18.177 --> 01:13:20.255
Yeah, I don't see why not.

1070
01:13:20.255 --> 01:13:21.255
- Seriously.

1071
01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:25.088
- Hey.

1072
01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:32.163
We're gonna share a bed
together someday you and me.


1073
01:13:32.163 --> 01:13:32.996
I promise.

1074
01:13:33.985 --> 01:13:35.318
- You mean that.

1075
01:13:36.726 --> 01:13:38.742
- You bet I do.

1076
01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:43.376
But until then don't make me
sleep on a lumpy old couch.


1077
01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:44.209
- Okay.

1078
01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:50.461
(glass breaking)

1079
01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.052
(Jordan growling)

1080
01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:57.141
- Lindsay,

1081
01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.084
Stop.

1082
01:13:58.084 --> 01:13:59.746
Help me get him to the bedroom.

1083
01:13:59.746 --> 01:14:02.559
Run ahead and open the door.

1084
01:14:02.559 --> 01:14:05.392
(Jordan gasping)

1085
01:14:08.595 --> 01:14:11.595
Find something to restrain him with.

1086
01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:14.900
I thought we got rid of you.

1087
01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.077
- No, never, never.

1088
01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:18.519
- You are going to learn to do

1089
01:14:18.519 --> 01:14:21.145
what I as a man of God say.

1090
01:14:21.145 --> 01:14:22.916
(tense music)

1091
01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.792
- [Lindsay] Will this work?

1092
01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:28.154
- I'll hold him down you tie him.

1093
01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:29.321
Tie him tight.

1094
01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:34.178
(Jordan muttering)

1095
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.040
Grab that belt.

1096
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.697
You can leave now.

1097
01:14:49.697 --> 01:14:51.245
- No way I'm staying.

1098
01:14:51.245 --> 01:14:52.888
- Leave.

1099
01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.721
Leave.

1100
01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:56.102
- She's staying.

1101
01:14:57.171 --> 01:14:59.301
Hey, look at me.

1102
01:14:59.301 --> 01:15:04.250
- Eli, what's happening to (slapping).

1103
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.893
- I will receive God's judgment say it.

1104
01:15:07.893 --> 01:15:08.810
- Fuck you.

1105
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:13.509
- I release him and return
to the fiery pit say it.


1106
01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.314
- There is no pit.

1107
01:15:15.314 --> 01:15:16.564
- I will leave.

1108
01:15:19.468 --> 01:15:24.032
Lindsay, grab that cross
from the living room.


1109
01:15:24.032 --> 01:15:26.720
(tense music)

1110
01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.637
(heavy breathing)

1111
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.540
(Jordan muttering)

1112
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.026
Spirit of perversion come out.

1113
01:16:07.026 --> 01:16:09.644
Come out in the name of Jesus.

1114
01:16:09.644 --> 01:16:11.125
- Come out.

1115
01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.936
Leave this body and return to the pit.

1116
01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.603
- I am light say it.

1117
01:16:18.215 --> 01:16:22.215
I release Jordan and
return to the pit say it.


1118
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:24.647
I release Jordan.

1119
01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.771
- No.

1120
01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:30.604
No.

1121
01:16:34.499 --> 01:16:37.808
- Lindsay, get a belt
or something stronger.


1122
01:16:37.808 --> 01:16:39.900
I don't know if I can hold him.

1123
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.472
Lindsay.

1124
01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:42.305
- Stop.

1125
01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:45.250
(tense music)

1126
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.500
- Give me that.

1127
01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:49.913
Tie him again

1128
01:16:49.913 --> 01:16:51.413
tighter this time.

1129
01:16:55.665 --> 01:16:59.298
Turn over so she can tie your hands.

1130
01:16:59.298 --> 01:17:02.131
(Jordan gasping)

1131
01:17:03.561 --> 01:17:06.311
(Jordan crying)

1132
01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.830
- Eli, help me.

1133
01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:18.725
Eli, please.
- Jordan.


1134
01:17:18.725 --> 01:17:19.924
- Don't listen to it.

1135
01:17:19.924 --> 01:17:21.846
It's just the demon trying to fool you.

1136
01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.434
- Filthy sex demon.

1137
01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:24.749
Show it, Eli.

1138
01:17:24.749 --> 01:17:26.796
Take the sword of the spirit
and cut right through it.


1139
01:17:26.796 --> 01:17:28.609
Show it that if it doesn't
come out on it's own


1140
01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:30.499
we're going to go in after it.

1141
01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:32.154
Show it, show it.

1142
01:17:32.154 --> 01:17:35.553
- I have committed perverse
thoughts and actions,


1143
01:17:35.553 --> 01:17:38.806
and I am ready to receive
God's judgment say it.


1144
01:17:38.806 --> 01:17:42.209
- I have committed
perverse thoughts and acts.


1145
01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:45.459
- Ready to receive God judgment say it.

1146
01:17:46.405 --> 01:17:49.262
- I am ready to receive (screaming)

1147
01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:51.139
- God, release it.

1148
01:17:51.139 --> 01:17:52.056
Release it.

1149
01:17:54.106 --> 01:17:55.588
- Come out demon.

1150
01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:58.314
I release you with God's power.

1151
01:17:58.314 --> 01:18:00.105
I spill your diseased blood,

1152
01:18:00.105 --> 01:18:02.854
and fill you up with the spirit.

1153
01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:04.638
I spill your perversion,

1154
01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:07.436
and fill you with the spirit.

1155
01:18:07.436 --> 01:18:10.436
(Jordan screaming)

1156
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.197
(Jordan mumbling)

1157
01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:49.721
(Jordan crying)

1158
01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:21.073
- I'm telling you Jordan

1159
01:19:21.073 --> 01:19:22.866
is the one responsible for the goat head.

1160
01:19:22.866 --> 01:19:24.663
I mean you can
see what he's capable of.

1161
01:19:24.663 --> 01:19:27.500
He's completely manifested.

1162
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.451
I think we should call your dad.

1163
01:19:30.451 --> 01:19:33.970
- I think we should spend some
time in quiet contemplation.


1164
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.553
- Of course you do.

1165
01:19:37.757 --> 01:19:40.626
- I'm gonna take a shower, okay.

1166
01:19:40.626 --> 01:19:44.793
Why don't you make yourself
some tea or something.


1167
01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:52.959
We'll figure out what
we're gonna do after that.


1168
01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:58.638
(dog barking)

1169
01:20:03.664 --> 01:20:04.767
(tense music)

1170
01:20:04.767 --> 01:20:07.600
(water splashing)

1171
01:20:13.863 --> 01:20:16.113
- Did you get our messages?

1172
01:20:19.568 --> 01:20:22.985
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1173
01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.042
- Ascencion won't be
coming back here anymore.


1174
01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:30.336
Blanca won't be coming back here anymore.

1175
01:20:30.336 --> 01:20:31.669
If you're very,

1176
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:36.893
very careful I won't be
coming back here anymore.


1177
01:20:38.861 --> 01:20:41.861
You know what I'm talking about now?

1178
01:20:48.412 --> 01:20:51.495
(suspenseful music)

1179
01:21:17.533 --> 01:21:21.700
(Jordan gasping)
(Lindsay screaming)


1180
01:21:27.171 --> 01:21:30.088
(Lindsay gasping)

1181
01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:35.640
- No.

1182
01:21:43.868 --> 01:21:44.701
(Lindsay screaming)

1183
01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:47.034
(loud thud)

1184
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.809
(water splashing)

1185
01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:10.978
(tense music)

1186
01:22:10.978 --> 01:22:14.228
(Eli singing faintly)

1187
01:22:20.737 --> 01:22:24.162
♫ Jesus keep me from all harm

1188
01:22:24.162 --> 01:22:27.995
♫ Jesus kept me from all harm

1189
01:22:31.305 --> 01:22:33.748
♫ I'll be satisfied as long

1190
01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:37.415
♫ I'll be satisfied as long

1191
01:22:41.551 --> 01:22:43.884
♫ As I walk

1192
01:22:44.905 --> 01:22:47.405
♫ Let me walk

1193
01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:50.914
♫ Close to you

1194
01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:05.747
(door squeaking)

1195
01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:16.458
- I command you to
get back on the bed.

1196
01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:40.261
(tense music)

1197
01:23:40.261 --> 01:23:41.710
- Jordan.

1198
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:42.986
Jordan, stop.

1199
01:23:42.986 --> 01:23:44.069
Jordan, stop.

1200
01:23:44.988 --> 01:23:46.870
Jordan, wait, wait.

1201
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:49.172
Jordan, Jordan no.

1202
01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:50.089
Jordan, no.

1203
01:23:51.012 --> 01:23:52.355
Jordan.

1204
01:23:52.355 --> 01:23:53.660
Jordan.

1205
01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.176
No, son.

1206
01:23:55.176 --> 01:23:57.476
No, son I'm speaking to Jordan now.

1207
01:23:57.476 --> 01:24:00.451
Jordan, I'm speaking to Jordan now.

1208
01:24:00.451 --> 01:24:01.451
Please stop.

1209
01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:03.773
Stop (crying).

1210
01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:06.744
Jordan, I need you please just leave.

1211
01:24:06.744 --> 01:24:10.070
(screaming) Fuck, Jordan.

1212
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:12.395
Stop what are you doing.

1213
01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:13.478
No, no, stop.

1214
01:24:15.324 --> 01:24:16.157
Jordan.

1215
01:24:18.848 --> 01:24:21.515
(Eli screaming)

1216

(Eli crying)

1217
01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:32.829
No, Jordan, no (crying).

1218
01:24:38.739 --> 01:24:39.898
Stop.

1219
01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:42.481
(tense music)

1220
01:24:59.473 --> 01:25:01.973
(Eli crying)

1221
01:25:41.095 --> 01:25:41.928
Jordan.

1222
01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:49.818
I forgive you.

1223
01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:09.619
Let me help you.

1224
01:26:20.506 --> 01:26:21.589
Pray with me.

1225
01:26:35.901 --> 01:26:38.484
(tense music)

1226
01:26:43.082 --> 01:26:48.065
♫ In the soul
cleansing blood of the Lamb

1227
01:26:48.065 --> 01:26:50.533
♫ Are your garments spotless

1228
01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:53.052
♫ Are they white as snow

1229
01:26:53.052 --> 01:26:57.219
♫ Are you washed in
the blood of the Lamb

1230
01:26:58.128 --> 01:27:03.002
♫ Lay aside the garments
that are stained with sin


1231
01:27:03.002 --> 01:27:07.169
♫ And be washed in
the blood of the Lamb

1232
01:27:08.192 --> 01:27:13.188
♫ There's a fountain
flowing for the soul unclean


1233
01:27:13.188 --> 01:27:17.355
♫ Go be washed in
the blood of the Lamb

1234
01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:20.811
♫ Are you washed

1235
01:27:20.811 --> 01:27:23.355
♫ In the blood

1236
01:27:23.355 --> 01:27:28.317
♫ In the soul
cleansing blood of the Lamb

1237
01:27:28.317 --> 01:27:30.910
♫ Are your garments spotless

1238
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:33.348
♫ Are they white as snow

1239
01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:37.515
♫ Are you washed in
the blood of the Lamb

1240
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:42.557
(soft guitar strumming)

1241
