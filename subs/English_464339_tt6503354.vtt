♪

2
00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.030
( busy office sounds )

3
00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:33.613
Where is Alison?

4
00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:35.405
You're gonna be late
for your date.


5
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.238
Relax, Erin.

6
00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:37.238
The restaurant's right
around the corner.


7
00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:38.238
I have plenty of time.

8
00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:40.405
Leigh, you have to go home
and change first.


9
00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:41.655
Take the blue dress
from my closet.


10
00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.321
Oh, and my yellow sweater.

11
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:44.447
What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?


12
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:45.739
You're going on a date.

13
00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.113
Your first date
since you broke up with-


14
00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:47.905
Aaaaah!

15
00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:48.739
Don't say it.

16
00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.238
He who shall not be named.

17
00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:51.071
Thank you.

18
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.321
I just think you should look
like you're at least trying.


19
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.572
This is so exciting!

20
00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:55.613
Why aren't you more excited?

21
00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:58.947
Because it's my first date
since I broke up with...


22
00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:01.530
I'm just trying to keep
expectations low.


23
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.739
Hi, ladies.

24
00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.905
Sorry I'm late,

25
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:06.697
I was stuck on a call with
advertising just explaining


26
00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:09.822
that The Richards Record
is a serious, hard-hitting


27
00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:12.030
online news magazine
that deserves respect.


28
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.071
But I am here now
and my full attention


29
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:17.071
is on my top two editors so they
can pitch me new ideas


30
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.739
for the next edition of...?

31
00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.363
The Bad Date Chronicles.

32
00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:21.697
The Foodie Country Blog.

33
00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:23.530
Hard-hitting news magazine

34
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.864
with a softer, more human edge.

35
00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:27.280
What have you got?

36
00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:41.447
All I'm saying is that I think
you're overdressed.


37
00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:42.238
It's our first date.

38
00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.572
Exactly. You're setting the bar
way too high.


39
00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:45.113
Look, Brad.

40
00:03:45.113 --> 00:03:46.196
She knows I'm the Styles
and Trends editor


41
00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:46.947
for The Peters Post.

42
00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:48.321
I have to look good, ok?

43
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.488
I can't show up wearing
ratty jeans and a t-shirt.


44
00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:51.905
Hey. I look good.

45
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.280
Yeah, for the editor
of a sport's blog.


46
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.530
Conner and Brad, my
two favourite editors.


47
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.822
You say that to all your
editors, Milo?


48
00:03:56.822 --> 00:03:58.697
Yeah, but with you two
I actually mean it.


49
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.238
Just don't tell that to Susan
at the news desk,


50
00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:01.447
it might break her heart.

51
00:04:01.447 --> 00:04:02.321
Hey, Milo.

52
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.238
Don't you think that Conner
is a bit overdressed


53
00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:05.572
for a first date?

54
00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:06.655
No, he's a style guy.

55
00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:09.280
He has to look stylish,
otherwise he's the sports guy.


56
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.447
Hey, I still think
you're gonna regret


57
00:04:10.447 --> 00:04:11.405
wearing those nice clothes.

58
00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:12.613
Think fast!

59
00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:17.780
Dude!

60
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.238
I've got an extra pair of pants
in the car.


61
00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:20.530
I will be right back.

62
00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:26.447
And if you don't like those,

63
00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:27.864
I also have two
really good submissions


64
00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:29.780
for this week's
Bad Date Chronicles.


65
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.071
One is from Becky who's date
brought his mother.


66
00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.113
The second is Steve who forgot
to put his car in park


67
00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:35.447
and it rolled into the lake.

68
00:04:35.447 --> 00:04:36.280
Car in the lake.

69
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.238
That'll make better headlines.

70
00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:38.488
That is so depressing.

71
00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.613
Do you know what we need?

72
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.488
A true love blog to balance
out your Bad Date Chronicles.


73
00:04:42.488 --> 00:04:43.363
True love?

74
00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:45.530
We don't do fiction
at The Richards Record.


75
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.155
Besides, nobody wants to read
about happy people.


76
00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.030
Happy people
don't get page views.


77
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.447
She's right, Erin.

78
00:04:51.447 --> 00:04:53.488
Not many people are into hearts
and flowers anymore.


79
00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:55.405
Says the girl going
on a date tonight.


80
00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:56.655
A date?

81
00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:59.238
Well, I should really let you
get going so you can go change.


82
00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:00.196
See?

83
00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:01.989
She's got a date with
the Style and Trends editor-


84
00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:02.655
Erin?

85
00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:04.363
Over at The Peters Post.

86
00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:05.780
Peters Post?!

87
00:05:08.864 --> 00:05:11.405
Do not get me started
about Milo Peters!!


88
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.238
Huh?

89
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:22.947
No.

90
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.405
No, I'm not going
on a date like this.


91
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:25.321
Why not?

92
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:27.196
Because I look like a roadie
for a hair metal band.


93
00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:29.321
Well, maybe she likes music.

94
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.113
Conner, why don't you just
go home and change?


95
00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:32.363
I can't. I'm already
running late,


96
00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:33.864
the restaurant's all
the way across town.


97
00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:34.864
How's my phone?

98
00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:36.321
Uh, it got coffee too.

99
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.280
It's flickering on and off.

100
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.071
Sorry, dude.

101
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.280
Just use the one on the desk.

102
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.447
I can't. Her name is
in my contacts.


103
00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:42.238
Why don't you just explain
it to her when you get there.


104
00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:44.071
You'll probably have a good
laugh over it.


105
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:44.864
Hey, Brad.

106
00:05:44.864 --> 00:05:47.321
She edits a blog called
The Bad Date Chronicles, ok?


107
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.822
So if I show up
looking like this,


108
00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:50.113
I end up on the front page.

109
00:05:50.113 --> 00:05:52.280
The Bad Date Chronicles?

110
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.947
Yeah.

111
00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:56.238
Do not get my started
about Alison Richards!


112
00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.321
You know who Milo Peters
stole his entire idea from,


113
00:05:58.321 --> 00:05:59.113
don't you?

114
00:05:59.113 --> 00:05:59.697
You?

115
00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:00.613
Me.

116
00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:01.697
I hired him.

117
00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:02.613
I trained him.

118
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:04.071
I was his mentor.

119
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.363
He turned around,
stabs me in the back,


120
00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:07.864
and starts the ridiculous
Peters Post.


121
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:10.321
She still tells people
I stole her idea


122
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:12.155
for The Peters Post.

123
00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:14.739
Like doing an online magazine
is some brilliant idea


124
00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:16.155
no one's ever thought of before.

125
00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:17.071
I am so late.

126
00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:18.822
Conner?

127
00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:21.363
Do not give this woman
any ammunition


128
00:06:21.363 --> 00:06:24.655
for The Bad Date Chronicles,
please.


129
00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:25.947
Any more ammunition.

130
00:06:25.947 --> 00:06:27.155
Yeah, thanks boss.

131
00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:28.155
I feel better already.

132
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.905
Do not reveal any of
our company's secrets,


133
00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:31.905
but get him to reveal his.

134
00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:33.530
Is it too late to get out
of this date?


135
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.363
Stop. It'll be fine.

136
00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.822
You won't end up in
The Bad Date Chronicles.


137
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.238
What happened?

138
00:06:48.238 --> 00:06:50.405
You are never going
to believe this.


139
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:51.572
First, he was late.

140
00:06:51.572 --> 00:06:52.864
Really late.

141
00:06:52.864 --> 00:06:53.780
( Erin ): And he didn't
call you?


142
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.405
( Leigh ): No.

143
00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.280
I was just getting ready
to leave when he rushes up.


144
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.989
Hey.

145
00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:57.697
Hey, hey, hey.

146
00:06:57.697 --> 00:06:58.447
I'm sorry, look.

147
00:06:58.447 --> 00:06:59.155
My car wouldn't start

148
00:06:59.155 --> 00:07:00.196
so I had to get a cab
and race over here-


149
00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:01.947
( Erin ): I thought he was
a style editor?


150
00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.238
( Leigh ): He said
something about coffee
and switching clothes


151
00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:06.113
with his friend, and
that he tried to call me


152
00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:07.655
but his phone didn't work.

153
00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:08.989
Then...

154
00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:10.280
Julian called.

155
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.905
Ju
- Julian?

156
00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:11.822
Peters Post?

157
00:07:11.822 --> 00:07:13.321
( Erin ): He didn't make
a reservation?


158
00:07:13.321 --> 00:07:14.530
( Leigh ): Apparently not.

159
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.989
We had to wait at the bar
for 45 minutes.


160
00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:18.530
I- I came here on a date,
I need you to help me.


161
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.572
( Erin ): Why didn't you go
some place else?


162
00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:22.739
Because he said it was the
hottest restaurant in town.


163
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:23.405
Ugh.

164
00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:24.780
Typical trends editor.

165
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.989
Once we got to the table,
things were ok.


166
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:29.613
Because all great love stories
start with things going "ok".


167
00:07:29.613 --> 00:07:30.822
You know what I mean.

168
00:07:30.822 --> 00:07:32.488
I didn't feel any butterflies,

169
00:07:32.488 --> 00:07:33.864
but he was charming and smart

170
00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:35.905
and it was going fine
and then...


171
00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:37.321
Maître d' hooked me up.

172
00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:39.530
I love it.

173
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.363
Oh man, this is...
this is the best.


174
00:07:41.363 --> 00:07:42.363
You gotta try this.

175
00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:43.071
Oh, that's ok.

176
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:43.697
I uh-

177
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:44.488
Seriously, this will take-

178
00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:46.697
( gasps )

179
00:07:46.697 --> 00:07:48.196
( Erin ): He set you on fire?!

180
00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:50.405
Sorry.

181
00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:52.155
In his defense, he did
put me out quickly.


182
00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:53.196
No, no!

183
00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:59.238
( gasping )

184
00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:00.280
Look at it this way.

185
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.572
At least you can say
you felt a spark.


186
00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:04.238
Yeah, it's a little soon
for fire jokes.


187
00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:05.613
Sorry.

188
00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:08.030
Especially because I'm not
even finished the story yet.


189
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.405
Don't tell me it gets worse.

190
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.405
Mmmhmm.

191
00:08:11.405 --> 00:08:12.780
( Erin ): He left?!

192
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.280
Leigh ): At first I thought
was in the bathroom.


193
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.822
Or maybe making a call
on his broken phone


194
00:08:16.822 --> 00:08:18.780
but he never came back, so-

195
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.864
( Erin ): No!

196
00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:20.822
( Leigh ): Yes.

197
00:08:20.822 --> 00:08:23.447
I had to pay the whole bill.

198
00:08:23.447 --> 00:08:25.363
You are going to make him
reimburse you.


199
00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:26.488
Reimburse us?

200
00:08:26.488 --> 00:08:28.989
No. I just want to dry off,
accept the fact that


201
00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:30.822
I'm never going on a date again

202
00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:32.405
and eat my body weight
in ice cream.


203
00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:34.196
I will admit, this was
not a great re-entry


204
00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.196
into the dating pool.

205
00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:37.280
But, on the other hand,

206
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.947
maybe this is an improvement
from your break-up with-


207
00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:40.113
Don't say his name!

208
00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:41.822
The worst human
who ever lived.


209
00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:42.822
Thank you.

210
00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.947
How awful is it that being
set on fire is actually better


211
00:08:44.947 --> 00:08:47.405
than my last serious
relationship?


212
00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:49.697
Well, at least now you have
your own bad date chronicle


213
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:51.530
and you're not just editing
other people's.


214
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.572
I am not putting this
on the site.


215
00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:54.613
Uh, yeah you are.

216
00:08:54.613 --> 00:08:56.989
You're gonna crush
every other bad date ever.


217
00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:58.238
It's not a competition, Erin.

218
00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:58.947
It should be.

219
00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:00.071
'Cause you'd win.

220
00:09:03.822 --> 00:09:04.822
Hey, buddy.

221
00:09:04.822 --> 00:09:05.864
How was the big date?

222
00:09:05.864 --> 00:09:06.780
It was a disaster.

223
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.530
Why?

224
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.989
Well, I couldn't get my car
to start


225
00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:11.113
so I had to take a cab
and race over there.


226
00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:12.405
( Conner ): Julian,
the restaurant critic,


227
00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.155
said he would get me a
reservation at Il Tempo.


228
00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.238
( Brad ): And he didn't?

229
00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:17.989
Julian!

230
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:20.196
onner ): So we were at
bar for like half an hour.


231
00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:21.447
( Brad ): Why didn't you just
go somewhere else?


232
00:09:21.447 --> 00:09:22.488
Because I didn't have my car

233
00:09:22.488 --> 00:09:25.113
and I wasn't gonna
ask her to drive, and besides,


234
00:09:25.113 --> 00:09:29.280
once we started talking
she was smart and funny.


235
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.572
It wasn't bad.

236
00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:31.989
When you're telling your buddy
about the hot date


237
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:33.071
you went on the night before,

238
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:36.238
you probably shouldn't include
the phrase "it wasn't bad".


239
00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:39.447
Yeah, well, it definitely
got hotter.


240
00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:40.238
Oh man, this is-

241
00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:41.196
this is the best.

242
00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:41.989
You gotta try this.

243
00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:43.238
Oh, that's ok, I have-

244
00:09:43.238 --> 00:09:44.238
Seriously, this will change
your life-


245
00:09:44.238 --> 00:09:45.488
( gasps )

246
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.613
She set herself on fire?

247
00:09:49.613 --> 00:09:50.947
I'm totally freaking out!

248
00:09:50.947 --> 00:09:52.071
( laughing )

249
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:53.613
onner ): I'm convinced that
s woman's gonna press charges


250
00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:54.697
against me or something,

251
00:09:54.697 --> 00:09:56.405
so I go to get her
some paper towels,


252
00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:58.905
and to splash some water
on my face.


253
00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:02.447
You know, that waiter
would have


254
00:10:02.447 --> 00:10:03.405
probably brought you
another pitcher.


255
00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:04.530
Shut up.

256
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.989
( Conner ): Anyway, I managed
not to hyperventilate,


257
00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:07.780
and then...

258
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.363
( snap )

259
00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:16.905
Hello?

260
00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:18.030
Hello!

261
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.697
You got locked in the bathroom?

262
00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:23.405
( laughs )

263
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:24.947
By the time I got out
she was gone.


264
00:10:24.947 --> 00:10:26.780
And to make things worse,
she paid.


265
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.613
Oh, dude. That's bad.

266
00:10:28.613 --> 00:10:29.572
I wanted to try to call her

267
00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:30.905
to explain everything
that happened


268
00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.530
but my phone still
wasn't working


269
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.989
so I just crashed and figured
I'd deal with it in the morning.


270
00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:37.071
Conner.

271
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.113
I've been trying to call you
for an hour.


272
00:10:38.113 --> 00:10:38.989
You gotta see this.

273
00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:39.822
What's going on?

274
00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:40.822
Everyone's looking for you.

275
00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:41.572
Why?

276
00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:42.655
Because of how your date
went last night.


277
00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:43.780
How do you know how my date
went last night?


278
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.739
The whole world knows how
your date went last night.


279
00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:47.530
Read.

280
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.071
"He showed up an hour late
looking like he had just come


281
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:51.155
"from playing video games
in his mother's basement."


282
00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:52.155
Oh no.

283
00:10:52.155 --> 00:10:55.530
We got calls from websites,
TV stations, newspapers...


284
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.321
You've gone viral, dude!

285
00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:58.530
She didn't even use my name.

286
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.488
How-

287
00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:01.822
"My date with Conrad,
a lifestyle and trends editor


288
00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:03.238
"for an online magazine."

289
00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:04.864
It wasn't hard to crack
the code.


290
00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:05.989
Guys, what do I do?

291
00:11:05.989 --> 00:11:08.405
Change your name,
move to another state?


292
00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:09.530
I have to try to talk to her,
you know?


293
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.613
Convince her to take it down.

294
00:11:10.613 --> 00:11:11.947
Post a retraction or something.

295
00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:12.905
Excellent idea.

296
00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:15.655
Yes, do that.

297
00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:16.780
Where are you going?

298
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.780
With you.

299
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.947
You were late for dinner
and she set herself on fire.


300
00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:21.780
( laughs )

301
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.697
I have to see what she's doing
for an encore.


302
00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:35.030
Leigh.

303
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.780
Conner.

304
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.071
Conner!

305
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.697
You have a lot of nerve!

306
00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.113
He's got a lot of nerve?

307
00:11:40.113 --> 00:11:41.447
She's the one making up stuff
about their dates


308
00:11:41.447 --> 00:11:43.196
and broadcasting it
to the world.


309
00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:43.864
Who are you?

310
00:11:43.864 --> 00:11:45.530
His friend Brad,
who are you?


311
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.071
I'm her friend, Erin.

312
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.488
What does he mean,
I made stuff up?


313
00:11:48.488 --> 00:11:50.238
What you wrote on your site,
that didn't happen.


314
00:11:50.238 --> 00:11:50.905
I was there.

315
00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:52.697
I was the one on fire,
remember?


316
00:11:52.697 --> 00:11:54.030
Yeah, I feel terrible
about that,


317
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.905
but there were extenuating
circumstances.


318
00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:57.655
Look, I didn't use your name.

319
00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:59.030
Yeah, but everyone knows
it's me.


320
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.613
This could affect my job,
my life.


321
00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:02.363
My mother called me
all the way from Ohio


322
00:12:02.363 --> 00:12:04.864
asking what she had done wrong
to make me turn out like this.


323
00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:05.405
Really?

324
00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:06.822
Yeah.

325
00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:07.697
I'm sorry, I-

326
00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:08.447
Don't be sorry.

327
00:12:08.447 --> 00:12:09.864
This is his fault, Leigh.

328
00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:11.447
It is not his fault.

329
00:12:11.447 --> 00:12:12.864
You haven't even heard
his side of it yet.


330
00:12:12.864 --> 00:12:14.989
Well, he has a column
in The Peters Post.


331
00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:16.905
Maybe he should go see
if the truth is trending.


332
00:12:16.905 --> 00:12:17.572
Oh, no-

333
00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:18.655
Ok. He will.

334
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:19.530
No, maybe we should-

335
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.739
No, Conner, it is time
to fight fire with fire.


336
00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:22.613
See what I did there?

337
00:12:22.613 --> 00:12:23.864
Funny. Very funny.

338
00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:25.864
We'll just see who has
the last laugh.


339
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:33.780
Put something in there about
all we should do


340
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.238
is think about is think
about herself.


341
00:12:35.238 --> 00:12:37.447
"Oh, I can't believe
he made me wait.


342
00:12:37.447 --> 00:12:39.155
"Oh, I'm on fire!"

343
00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:40.030
I'm not gonna say that.

344
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.155
"And he didn't call to explain
what had happened.


345
00:12:42.155 --> 00:12:43.780
"Maybe he can't get
good cell service


346
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.864
"in his mother's basement."

347
00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:47.030
Huh?

348
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.739
One sec.

349
00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:51.947
Perhaps if she had taken
the time to listen to my side


350
00:12:51.947 --> 00:12:54.447
we would have a fun story
to laugh about later.


351
00:12:54.447 --> 00:12:56.196
But instead she jumped
to conclusions


352
00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:58.321
so she would have a good story
for her blog.


353
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:01.947
Yeah, that's- that's good.

354
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.071
More of that.

355
00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:14.113
Stop hitting refresh.

356
00:13:14.113 --> 00:13:17.196
Well, how else are we gonna
know if he posts something?


357
00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:21.321
( phone ringing
and cell vibrating )


358
00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:22.405
I think we'll know.

359
00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:23.864
Refresh.

360
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.655
Oh, he did NOT call you
self-absorbed.


361
00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:33.113
The handle came off
the bathroom door?


362
00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.822
Well, I didn't know that.

363
00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:37.280
"Jump to conclusions"?

364
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.739
Well, he has a point,
I guess.


365
00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:41.363
No, he doesn't.

366
00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.905
He's the bad guy.

367
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.030
If what he's saying is true,
there is no bad guy.


368
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.238
You have to write a rebuttal.

369
00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:50.071
Ok, I'm putting an end
to this right now.


370
00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:09.989
Hey.

371
00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:11.780
Um, I'll see you guys later.

372
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.613
Hi.

373
00:14:12.613 --> 00:14:13.280
Hey.

374
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.488
Sorry to barge in unannounced.

375
00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:15.864
No, no, no. That's ok.

376
00:14:15.864 --> 00:14:16.864
How'd you get back?

377
00:14:16.864 --> 00:14:18.697
Uh, the receptionist read
both our columns,


378
00:14:18.697 --> 00:14:19.655
she's taking my side.

379
00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:20.822
Ok, got it.

380
00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:21.989
Wanna sit?

381
00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:22.572
Sure.

382
00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:23.864
Ok.

383
00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.613
Listen, I read your post.

384
00:14:27.613 --> 00:14:29.572
You were actually a lot nicer
about the whole thing


385
00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:31.071
than I thought you would be.

386
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:32.947
I mean, I called you
self-absorbed and clueless.


387
00:14:32.947 --> 00:14:34.905
I called you vain
and entitled, so...


388
00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:36.363
Yeah.

389
00:14:36.363 --> 00:14:38.822
I wanted to apologize
for jumping to conclusions.


390
00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:40.947
I should have let you explain.

391
00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:41.864
That's ok.

392
00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:46.030
You know, and I wanted to
apologize for, well, everything.


393
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.238
( laughs )

394
00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:48.405
Apology accepted.

395
00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:48.947
Great.

396
00:14:48.947 --> 00:14:50.155
Truce?

397
00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:51.572
Truce.

398
00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:55.196
Ok, so I'm going to go back
to chronicling


399
00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:56.405
other people's bad dates.

400
00:14:56.405 --> 00:14:58.363
And I'll go back to writing
about the latest trendy topic


401
00:14:58.363 --> 00:15:01.113
that everyone will forget
about by tomorrow afternoon.


402
00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:03.488
And we can both just forget
this ever happened.


403
00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:04.947
Sounds like a plan to me.

404
00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:05.822
Ok.

405
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.780
Well, I better go.

406
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.196
Ok.

407
00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:10.989
Thanks for stopping by.

408
00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:12.405
Yeah.

409
00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:22.739
( door opens )

410
00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:31.155
Hey. How'd it go?

411
00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:31.989
He was fine.

412
00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:33.071
We made peace.

413
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:34.363
Well, you are a much
better person than I am


414
00:15:34.363 --> 00:15:35.864
because I'm still ready for war.

415
00:15:35.864 --> 00:15:37.447
Nobody messes
with my friends.


416
00:15:37.447 --> 00:15:39.280
I've been responding to comments
on his post for hours


417
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.071
just to work out
some aggression.


418
00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:42.613
Just let it go.

419
00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:43.613
If I can, you can.

420
00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:44.530
You're right.

421
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.905
Absolutely right.

422
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.947
You've already opened the laptop
again, haven't you?


423
00:15:57.947 --> 00:15:59.196
Yeah.

424
00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:03.321
"Sounds like this Bad Date
Chronicle girl


425
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:07.238
"needs to go on a date
with a real man"?


426
00:16:07.238 --> 00:16:10.613
I guess I can't expect more
from someone with a screen name


427
00:16:10.613 --> 00:16:14.155
of Muscleman1988,

428
00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:17.155
but maybe if you got out of
the gym every now and then


429
00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:22.196
you'd be able to deal with real
women instead of just girls.


430
00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:25.280
Signed, FoodieFan86.

432
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:40.989
Private chat?

433
00:16:43.363 --> 00:16:47.572
Ok, singlesurfer87, what do
you want to say to me?


434
00:16:47.572 --> 00:16:51.238
"Foodiefan88 I couldn't
agree more.


435
00:16:51.238 --> 00:16:55.447

Alison Richards.

443
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.113
Still answering your own phone,
huh Alison?


444
00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:26.363
Trying to prove you're
a woman of the people?


445
00:17:26.363 --> 00:17:27.947
Milo Peters.

446
00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.321
How are things going over
at that little blog of yours?


447
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:32.071
Not so little anymore.

448
00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:34.572
One of our posts just hit

449
00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:36.780
Really? I didn't know that
many people


450
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.697
in your target
audience could read.


451
00:17:38.697 --> 00:17:40.780
Apparently about a million more
than yours.


452
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.655
It seems people are siding
with my trends guy


453
00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:44.363
over your bad date woman.

454
00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:45.655
No accounting for taste.

455
00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:48.488
Same old Alison,
beautiful but ruthless.


456
00:17:48.488 --> 00:17:50.155
Same old Milo.

457
00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:52.071
Do women really fall
for that kind of line?


458
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:52.780
You did.

459
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.947
Once.

460
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.030
We went on one date.

461
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.321
It was horrible.

462
00:17:56.321 --> 00:17:57.280
It wasn't that bad.

463
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.530
I have had surgeries
less painful.


464
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.780
Is there something I can do
for you, Milo?


465
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.530
Actually I was thinking we could
help each other.


466
00:18:06.655 --> 00:18:07.822
I'm listening.

467
00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:10.363
It's obvious these posts
are connecting with people,


468
00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:11.530
and I'm not gonna lie.

469
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.155
15 million views is the biggest
thing we've ever seen


470
00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:18.613
and I'm guessing 14 million
is for you, too.


471
00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:20.363
I can neither confirm
or deny that.


472
00:18:20.363 --> 00:18:21.488
You just did.

473
00:18:21.488 --> 00:18:23.989
So it seems it's in our
mutual best interest


474
00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:28.530
to try and keep
this thing going.


475
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.280
What did you have in mind?

476
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280
You want me to what?

477
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.280
Go out with him again.

478
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.613
Like a do-over.

479
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.071
A do-over?

480
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:36.238
Woah, woah, woah.

481
00:18:36.238 --> 00:18:37.780
Ok, Milo, let me get
this straight.


482
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.655
You, my boss, want me,
your employee,


483
00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:41.196
to go out with a girl for work?

484
00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:42.572
I'm not asking you
to marry her,


485
00:18:42.572 --> 00:18:44.321
just go out for dinner with her
once or twice.


486
00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:44.864
Wait, wha-

487
00:18:44.864 --> 00:18:45.780
twice?

488
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.947
Let's make it three times.

489
00:18:46.947 --> 00:18:48.488
You want me to go on
three dates with him?


490
00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.030
Leigh, look at it like
public service.


491
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.905
Your dates help our readers,
good or bad.


492
00:18:53.905 --> 00:18:56.155
Yes, and then you both write
your respective columns.


493
00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.280
You want me to review my date?

494
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.071
However it turns out,
good or bad.


495
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:00.321
Besides, Conner,

496
00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:02.113
this is the kind of thing
that could make your career.


497
00:19:02.113 --> 00:19:03.238
I mean, come on.

498
00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:06.155
This is styles and trends,
and this is definitely trending.


499
00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:08.864
We're talking national
attention here.


500
00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.655
You don't want to be editing
The Bad Date Chronicles


501
00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:12.238
for the rest of your life,
do you?


502
00:19:12.238 --> 00:19:13.447
I want to be a news editor.

503
00:19:13.447 --> 00:19:14.572
Serious content.

504
00:19:14.572 --> 00:19:16.655
I don't see how this gets me
any closer to that.


505
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.280
Well, you just happen to be
talking to somebody


506
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.238
that hires editors.

507
00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:24.363
She's expecting your call.

508
00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.655
He'll call you.

509
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.280
Thank you.

510
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.280
( laughs )

511
00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:03.697
You are not going
to believe this.


512
00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:05.196
I don't believe it.

513
00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:06.238
Are you gonna do it?

514
00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:07.822
I don't know if I have
a choice.


515
00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:09.739
She can't make you go out
on a date with him.


516
00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:10.697
Three dates.

517
00:20:10.697 --> 00:20:12.864
And yes she can,
she's our boss!


518
00:20:12.864 --> 00:20:14.613
I mean obviously I'd love
for my career to be bigger


519
00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.697
but I don't know if this is
the way I want it to happen.


520
00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:17.864
Well, maybe it won't be
so bad.


521
00:20:17.864 --> 00:20:19.739
I mean, you said you kinda
made up with her, right?


522
00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:21.321
I only went over there
because I was convinced


523
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:24.030
I'd never have to see him again.

524
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.363
( sighs )

525
00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:27.697
Ugh.

526
00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:45.196
You are such a creature
of habit.


527
00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:48.030
Same coffee shop, same time,

528
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.947
and I'm guessing same coffee,
yep.


529
00:20:51.947 --> 00:20:52.989
I don't come here every day.

530
00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:55.864
Alison, I worked with you
for over two years.


531
00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:59.697
You think there isn't a single
thing I don't know about you?


532
00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:00.655
What do you want, Milo?

533
00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:03.071
Well, just checking in,
seeing if you're ready


534
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:05.447
for our big date tonight.

535
00:21:05.447 --> 00:21:07.447
Oh, is that tonight?

536
00:21:07.447 --> 00:21:09.238
Let me guess, you forgot
all about it?


537
00:21:09.238 --> 00:21:11.196
Totally slipped my mind.

538
00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:12.864
Well, maybe we need to make this

539
00:21:12.864 --> 00:21:15.864
a little bit more interesting
for you then.


540
00:21:15.864 --> 00:21:18.780
Go on.

541
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.030
I'm thinking a little wager.

542
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.989
Whoever gets the most
post views wins.


543
00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:26.155
Wins what?

544
00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:27.572
One dollar.

545
00:21:27.572 --> 00:21:30.030
Oh, times a little tough
over at Peters Post?


546
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.530
It's symbolic,
because I think losing


547
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:38.488
will drive you crazy
no matter what it is.


548
00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:41.488
Ok, you're on.

549
00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:42.488
But no interference.

550
00:21:42.488 --> 00:21:43.405
What do you mean?

551
00:21:43.405 --> 00:21:45.321
Well, it's in our interest
for these dates to go poorly.


552
00:21:45.321 --> 00:21:46.613
Whatever happens, happens.

553
00:21:46.613 --> 00:21:49.030
We stay out of it.

554
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.530
Deal.

555
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.155
So do you know where
they're going tonight?


556
00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:54.780
Hmm.

557
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.947
It's a do-over date so I believe
they're heading back


558
00:21:56.947 --> 00:21:59.864
to the scene of the crime,
Il Tempo.


559
00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:01.196
And who's idea was that?

560
00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:02.530
You know, I'd like
my dollar bill


561
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.071
to have nice, crisp,
sharp corners.


562
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:07.363
Please and thank you.

563
00:22:07.363 --> 00:22:09.697
Enjoy your coffee.

564
00:22:09.697 --> 00:22:12.071
I will.

565
00:22:27.113 --> 00:22:29.071
You have nothing to eat.

566
00:22:29.071 --> 00:22:30.071
Well, you invited yourself over,

567
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:31.488
you should have brought
your own food.


568
00:22:31.488 --> 00:22:32.280
Which tie?

569
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.989
For what?

570
00:22:32.989 --> 00:22:35.780
The job interview you have
to go on if you mess this up?


571
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.822
How is that helpful?

572
00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.697
Just relax, you know.

573
00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:40.572
Try and be yourself.

574
00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:42.321
You always know what to say.

575
00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:43.071
Ok, look.

576
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:44.155
If absolutely nothing else,

577
00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:46.905
just view this as like practice,
you know?


578
00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:48.947
It's been a long time
since Amy.


579
00:22:48.947 --> 00:22:50.488
Yeah, well, it takes a while
to get over


580
00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:52.238
having your heart stomped on.

581
00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:54.280
But you're dating again,
so that's progress.


582
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:54.989
No, no, no.

583
00:22:54.989 --> 00:22:55.822
This is not a date, Brad.

584
00:22:55.822 --> 00:22:57.989
This is being forced by
my boss to go out for dinner


585
00:22:57.989 --> 00:23:00.613
with a woman for work,
and you know what?


586
00:23:00.613 --> 00:23:02.238
I feel cheap.

587
00:23:02.238 --> 00:23:03.780
Yeah, ok, that is
a little weird,


588
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.655
but that first one, that,
that was a real date.


589
00:23:06.655 --> 00:23:08.238
And look how that turned out.

590
00:23:08.238 --> 00:23:10.655
Ok, I'm ready.

591
00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.822
Wish me luck.

592
00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:12.613
You don't need luck.

593
00:23:12.613 --> 00:23:13.447
Oh, thanks man.

594
00:23:13.447 --> 00:23:14.447
I meant all you have to do

595
00:23:14.447 --> 00:23:16.113
is just not set someone else
on fire.


596
00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:17.864
It's kind of a low bar,
you know?


597
00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:18.989
( laughs )

598
00:23:18.989 --> 00:23:20.739
Don't forget, she writes BAD
Date Chronicles.


599
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:23.155
Very funny.

600
00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:24.989
Wish you had some food.

601
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:35.363
How do I look?

602
00:23:35.363 --> 00:23:36.989
Perfect.

603
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:39.113
It's a little chilly though,
do you want to borrow a sweater?


604
00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:40.113
Is it fireproof?

605
00:23:40.113 --> 00:23:41.447
Right. Sorry.

606
00:23:41.447 --> 00:23:42.739
Never mind.

607
00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:44.238
I can't believe I'm so nervous.

608
00:23:44.238 --> 00:23:45.530
It's not even a real date.

609
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.822
I'm sure it'll be fine.

610
00:23:46.822 --> 00:23:48.321
Maybe you'll even have some fun.

611
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:51.280
Fun, on a date,
does that ever happen?


612
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.947
Wow, he really did a number
on you, didn't he?


613
00:23:53.947 --> 00:23:55.447
Who?

614
00:23:55.447 --> 00:23:56.572
You know...

615
00:23:56.572 --> 00:23:57.488
Oh.

616
00:23:57.488 --> 00:23:58.947
Yeah.

617
00:23:58.947 --> 00:24:01.697
Well, he broke my heart.

618
00:24:01.697 --> 00:24:03.071
Actually, it was more than that.

619
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:07.613
He made me feel like...
like I wasn't good enough.


620
00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:09.822
But you are, you know.

621
00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:11.613
You're amazing.

622
00:24:11.613 --> 00:24:12.697
Stop it.

623
00:24:12.697 --> 00:24:13.822
You're gonna make
my mascara run


624
00:24:13.822 --> 00:24:17.947
and you know how much
I hate female clichés.


625
00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:19.655
Call me if you need
to be rescued.


626
00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:21.947
Or, you know, if he wrecks
the date on purpose.


627
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:23.864
Thanks for that.

628
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.321
Hi.

629
00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:41.989
Hello.

630
00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:42.905
You're here.

631
00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:44.488
You sound surprised.

632
00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:45.572
Sorry.

633
00:24:45.572 --> 00:24:47.697
This is a little uh... weird,
huh?


634
00:24:47.697 --> 00:24:48.864
Yeah. Very weird.

635
00:24:48.864 --> 00:24:50.196
I mean, I've been set-up
by co-workers before


636
00:24:50.196 --> 00:24:51.488
but this is ridiculous.

637
00:24:51.488 --> 00:24:53.155
Exactly. Yeah.

638
00:24:54.238 --> 00:24:55.947
Well, shall we?

639
00:24:55.947 --> 00:24:57.864
Oh, we have a reservation?

640
00:24:57.864 --> 00:25:00.488
Uh, I sounded surprised again,
didn't I?


641
00:25:00.488 --> 00:25:01.864
I heard it that time.

642
00:25:01.864 --> 00:25:03.238
Sorry.

643
00:25:03.238 --> 00:25:05.238
I'm going to see if our table
is ready.


644
00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:07.739
Good evening, sir.

645
00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:08.697
How may I assist you?

646
00:25:08.697 --> 00:25:09.739
Hi. Hi.

647
00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:12.488
I have a reservation for 8:30.

648
00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:14.697
Conner Michaels.

649
00:25:14.697 --> 00:25:16.447
Uh, yes.

650
00:25:16.447 --> 00:25:17.905
Here it is.

651
00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:19.822
Table for two.

652
00:25:19.822 --> 00:25:21.572
9:45pm.

653
00:25:21.572 --> 00:25:22.822
No. No, no, no.

654
00:25:22.822 --> 00:25:24.989
I made the reservation
for 8:30.


655
00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:25.822
No, sir.

656
00:25:25.822 --> 00:25:27.280
See, it was 8:30.

657
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.780
It was moved to 9:45pm.

658
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.030
Moved by who?

659
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.739
Well, I'm sure I don't know,
sir.


660
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:36.238
( phone rings )

661
00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:37.989
Il Tempo.

662
00:25:41.238 --> 00:25:43.405
Trying to tank the date.

663
00:25:43.405 --> 00:25:45.071
Ok.

664
00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:46.363
Ok, I see how it is.

665
00:25:46.363 --> 00:25:47.530
Hi.

666
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.947
What will it take to move
the reservation to 8:30?


667
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.530
( message alert )

668
00:26:06.363 --> 00:26:10.321
Private message
from singlesurfer87.


669
00:26:10.321 --> 00:26:13.155
"What do you think
of the recipe?"


670
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:15.030
I'm not done yet.

671
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.864
The pasta is still boiling.

672
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.196
"This is my family's
secret recipe.


673
00:26:24.196 --> 00:26:28.321
"If you mess it up I'll never
forgive myself for sharing it."


674
00:26:28.321 --> 00:26:31.363
Well, then stop
chatting me.


675
00:26:31.363 --> 00:26:35.530
I can't type and cook
at the same time.


676
00:26:37.822 --> 00:26:40.363
( message alert )

677
00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:42.155
"You've got two hands."

678
00:26:42.155 --> 00:26:43.613
( laughs )

679
00:27:02.363 --> 00:27:04.321
Thank you.

680
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:06.155
Do you think they remember us?

681
00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:10.905
I'm thinking yes.

682
00:27:13.447 --> 00:27:15.572
So.

683
00:27:15.572 --> 00:27:18.655
So.

684
00:27:18.655 --> 00:27:21.238
I- I literally have no idea
what to say right now.


685
00:27:21.238 --> 00:27:24.071
Yeah, me neither.

686
00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:25.071
I have a question.

687
00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:26.572
Can I ask you something?

688
00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:28.155
Sure.

689
00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:31.447
Did you- and look, don't take
this the wrong way, but...


690
00:27:31.447 --> 00:27:32.530
did you want to do this?

691
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.363
This whole he said
she said date thing?


692
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:38.196
Well, I- I mean, I thought
it was a cute idea.


693
00:27:38.196 --> 00:27:39.280
But it wasn't your idea.

694
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.071
No.

695
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:44.155
I didn't mean for that to sound
so emphatic.


696
00:27:44.155 --> 00:27:45.113
No, it's ok.

697
00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:46.321
Look, it wasn't my idea, either.

698
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:47.447
It was my boss.

699
00:27:47.447 --> 00:27:48.113
It wasn't me!

700
00:27:48.113 --> 00:27:49.405
It was all Alison.

701
00:27:49.405 --> 00:27:50.405
So you didn't want to be here,
either?


702
00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:53.405
No! And I did mean to say
that emphatically.


703
00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:55.572
Well, then, there-
look at that.


704
00:27:55.572 --> 00:27:56.655
We both have something
in common.


705
00:27:56.655 --> 00:27:58.363
Neither of us wants to be
on this date.


706
00:27:58.363 --> 00:27:59.613
And we both have crazy bosses.

707
00:27:59.613 --> 00:28:00.280
You know what?

708
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.405
I will drink to that.

709
00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:02.071
Cheers.

710
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.488
Cheers.

711
00:28:06.405 --> 00:28:07.196
Yes, you're in luck.

712
00:28:07.196 --> 00:28:09.113
Something just opened up
in three months.


713
00:28:09.113 --> 00:28:10.280
Mmmhmm.

714
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.488
Ok.

715
00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:14.280
Alright, I'll talk to you soon.

716
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.155
May I help you, sir?

717
00:28:15.155 --> 00:28:16.697
What? Oh, no, I'm good.

718
00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:22.447
Actually, do you mind
maybe just...


719
00:28:22.447 --> 00:28:25.280
just a little to your left?

720
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280
Hmm.

721
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.739
Yes, I do mind.

722
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.572
( phone rings )

723
00:28:34.572 --> 00:28:37.530
You're not the only one
who can talk on a phone.


724
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.280
Milo speaking.

725
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.655
Milo, are you interrupting
Leigh and Conner's date?


726
00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:43.989
What? No, of course not.

727
00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:44.780
Really?

728
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.947
The maître d' obviously thinks
you are.


729
00:29:01.447 --> 00:29:02.572
What are you doing here?

730
00:29:02.572 --> 00:29:03.697
What are YOU doing here?

731
00:29:03.697 --> 00:29:05.196
Protecting my investment.

732
00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:06.613
From the lobby?

733
00:29:06.613 --> 00:29:08.238
I'm surprised you don't have
a table here.


734
00:29:08.238 --> 00:29:08.947
I did.

735
00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.071
They weren't supposed
to be seated this early.


736
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:12.530
You changed the reservation.

737
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.697
I don't know what
you're talking about.


738
00:29:13.697 --> 00:29:14.780
What else did you do?

739
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.989
Nothing.

740
00:29:18.196 --> 00:29:20.822
What did you do?

741
00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:22.405
Nothing.

742
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.739
You look amazing,
by the way.


743
00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:31.989
Thank you.

744
00:29:31.989 --> 00:29:33.196
I like the suit.

745
00:29:33.196 --> 00:29:36.030
Thank you. It's Italian.

746
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.822
Anyway, I need to use
the ladies' room.


747
00:29:38.822 --> 00:29:40.071
Oh, good.

748
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:43.530
Because I have to go
to the lit-


749
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.363
I have to go to the car.

750
00:29:44.363 --> 00:29:46.071
For something in the car.

751
00:30:04.989 --> 00:30:06.405
( message alert )

752
00:30:38.864 --> 00:30:40.238
So I guess we should do
all the first date stuff


753
00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:42.488
that we didn't get to do
last time, right?


754
00:30:42.488 --> 00:30:43.071
Right.

755
00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:44.905
Like where we're from,
family,


756
00:30:44.905 --> 00:30:46.739
how long we've lived here
type stuff.


757
00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:47.530
The basics.

758
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.155
Ok, well, I'm from-

759
00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:50.613
( phone rings )

760
00:30:50.613 --> 00:30:55.238
Sorry, I- I forgot to turn
the ringer off.


761
00:30:55.238 --> 00:30:56.905
Oh, no, go ahead.

762
00:31:00.613 --> 00:31:01.363
Right.

763
00:31:01.363 --> 00:31:02.697
Well, uh, I am from-

764
00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:04.071
( phone vibrating )

765
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:05.613
Sorry.

766
00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:08.822
I'm sorry, I'm- I'm just
gonna turn it off.


767
00:31:13.947 --> 00:31:15.655
Ok, we should- we should
be good now.


768
00:31:15.655 --> 00:31:16.613
So, you were saying?

769
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:18.363
Yes, I was saying
that I'm from-


770
00:31:18.363 --> 00:31:21.947
Miss Ryness, there's a call
for you at the front desk.


771
00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:22.780
Really?

772
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.280
Mmmhmm.

773
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.697
That's... that's weird.

774
00:31:26.697 --> 00:31:28.739
I better take it.

775
00:31:28.739 --> 00:31:30.030
Of course. Go ahead.

776
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.739
Right this way.

777
00:31:36.447 --> 00:31:37.488
There you are.

778
00:31:37.488 --> 00:31:39.655
Thanks.

779
00:31:39.655 --> 00:31:40.905
Hello?

780
00:31:41.989 --> 00:31:43.655
Hello?

781
00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:44.530
Excuse me?

782
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.405
There's nobody there.

783
00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:47.697
Really?

784
00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:48.947
There was just a moment ago.

785
00:31:48.947 --> 00:31:51.447
Said it was your brother,
and that it was urgent.


786
00:31:51.447 --> 00:31:52.947
I don't have a brother.

787
00:31:52.947 --> 00:31:54.697
Hmm.

788
00:31:54.697 --> 00:31:57.238
I don't suppose he said his name
was Brad, did he?


789
00:31:57.238 --> 00:31:58.905
He didn't leave a name.

790
00:31:58.905 --> 00:32:00.572
Excuse me.

791
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.572
So.

792
00:32:10.572 --> 00:32:13.196
You need this date to go bad
too, huh?


793
00:32:13.196 --> 00:32:15.113
I'm onto you, buddy.

794
00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:21.196
A call from her brother.

795
00:32:21.196 --> 00:32:23.447
Mmmhmm. I see.

796
00:32:23.447 --> 00:32:26.321
I have no idea what you're
talking about.


797
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.572
Ok, this means war.

798
00:32:39.947 --> 00:32:41.864
( gasps )

799
00:32:48.613 --> 00:32:50.780
( breathing heavily )

800
00:33:03.113 --> 00:33:04.905
Well, this has been...

801
00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:07.613
Yeah, just...

802
00:33:07.613 --> 00:33:08.822
Maybe we should...

803
00:33:08.822 --> 00:33:09.947
I think so.

804
00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:10.905
But hey, look at it this way.

805
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:13.113
At least nothing burst
into flames.


806
00:33:13.113 --> 00:33:16.739
Sir, as requested,
our signature dessert.


807
00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:18.363
Dessert?

808
00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.238
Dessert?

809
00:33:20.655 --> 00:33:22.864
Yes. Cherries jubilee.

810
00:33:22.864 --> 00:33:24.947
( cries out )

811
00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:28.530
( laughing )

812
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.238
Oh man.

813
00:33:31.238 --> 00:33:32.321
"I'm not 100 percent sure

814
00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:34.905
"but I think he might be
trying to kill me.


815
00:33:34.905 --> 00:33:38.947
"I should check my will to make
sure he's not a beneficiary."


816
00:33:38.947 --> 00:33:42.155
Wow. This is worse
than the original.


817
00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:43.363
I didn't order that dessert.

818
00:33:43.363 --> 00:33:44.655
This is so great.

819
00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.697
Great? Why is it great?

820
00:33:45.697 --> 00:33:48.822
Because your version has
twice as many hits as hers does.


821
00:33:48.822 --> 00:33:49.530
We're winning.

822
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.530
It's totally worth the effort.

823
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.864
What effort?

824
00:33:51.864 --> 00:33:55.155
The effort... it takes to build
a company


825
00:33:55.155 --> 00:33:57.697
and hire brilliant editors
like you guys.


826
00:33:57.697 --> 00:34:00.822
Good stuff.

827
00:34:00.822 --> 00:34:02.822
Well, that was weird.

828
00:34:02.822 --> 00:34:04.155
Yeah, this is weird.

829
00:34:04.155 --> 00:34:06.113
In your blog you said

830
00:34:06.113 --> 00:34:08.447
"I have no way of proving
that she sets of fake calls


831
00:34:08.447 --> 00:34:09.697
"to interrupt the date,

832
00:34:09.697 --> 00:34:13.071
"but if a bad date plot fits,
wear it."


833
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:14.405
You really think she had her
roommate page her


834
00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:15.363
at the front desk?

835
00:34:15.363 --> 00:34:17.697
I don't know who else
it could have been.


836
00:34:23.238 --> 00:34:26.196
MyraB wants to know
why Conner hates women.


837
00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:27.447
Who's MyraB?

838
00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:29.572
One of the people commenting
on your article.


839
00:34:29.572 --> 00:34:30.572
Why are you reading those?

840
00:34:30.572 --> 00:34:32.739
Everyone who posts
on there is crazy.


841
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:33.989
They're not all crazy.

842
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.113
Well, I'll tell you what
is crazy.


843
00:34:35.113 --> 00:34:36.572
That Conner really thinks
I did all this


844
00:34:36.572 --> 00:34:38.405
just to make the date go badly.

845
00:34:38.405 --> 00:34:39.488
I think the operative word

846
00:34:39.488 --> 00:34:42.071
in the title Bad Date
Chronicles is "bad".


847
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:43.321
Besides, it's what you said
he did.


848
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:44.613
I know that's what he did.

849
00:34:44.613 --> 00:34:46.822
Maybe he's trying
to divert suspicion.


850
00:34:46.822 --> 00:34:47.739
This is ridiculous!

851
00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.113
I went through all of that
and he's still getting


852
00:34:49.113 --> 00:34:50.947
more views than I am.

853
00:34:50.947 --> 00:34:52.280
How's Alison taking it?

854
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.613
She's ready to explode.

855
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.613
If I don't find a way to get
the page views up somehow,


856
00:34:55.613 --> 00:34:57.739
I don't know what
she's gonna do.


857
00:35:04.697 --> 00:35:05.488
Alison Richards.

858
00:35:05.488 --> 00:35:06.572
Double or nothing?

859
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:09.613
You're on.

860
00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:31.488
Hi.

861
00:35:31.488 --> 00:35:33.405
Your office said I could find
you here.


862
00:35:33.405 --> 00:35:34.530
I'm uh, I'm Brad.

863
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.780
Conner's friend.

864
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.321
I remember who you are.

865
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:39.113
If you're looking for Leigh
she's not here.


866
00:35:39.113 --> 00:35:39.864
I'm not here to talk to Leigh,

867
00:35:39.864 --> 00:35:40.989
I'm here to talk to you.

868
00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:41.739
Why?

869
00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.613
Because you're the one
helping Leigh tank their dates.


870
00:35:43.613 --> 00:35:44.655
What are you talking about?

871
00:35:44.655 --> 00:35:45.989
I haven't tanked anything.

872
00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:47.739
Oh, so that wasn't you
calling her a hundred times?


873
00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:48.864
Of course not.

874
00:35:51.071 --> 00:35:52.905
Their second date is tonight.

875
00:35:52.905 --> 00:35:55.113
All I'm asking is that
you just stay out of it.


876
00:35:55.113 --> 00:35:56.155
I'm not in it.

877
00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:57.238
Maybe you should stay
out of it.


878
00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:59.572
Maybe you're the one
making Conner look bad.


879
00:35:59.572 --> 00:36:03.071
Look. I know you
don't like Conner


880
00:36:03.071 --> 00:36:11.321
but he's actually a really good
guy and he's been hurt, ok?


881
00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:15.155
His last relationship was...

882
00:36:15.155 --> 00:36:16.238
it took him a really long time

883
00:36:16.238 --> 00:36:21.238
to where he felt like
he could trust anyone, so...


884
00:36:21.238 --> 00:36:25.030
just stay out of it. Ok?

885
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.655
Leigh was hurt, too.

886
00:36:27.655 --> 00:36:31.113
So bad that she won't even
let me say his name around her.


887
00:36:31.113 --> 00:36:34.989
The Bad Date Chronicles
isn't just a job for her.


888
00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:38.739
It's her way of feeling
a little less... alone.


889
00:36:40.655 --> 00:36:42.613
I'm sorry to hear that.

890
00:36:42.613 --> 00:36:43.905
I'm sorry, too.

891
00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:44.947
For him.

892
00:36:44.947 --> 00:36:47.488
Just let them have their date.
Ok?


893
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.697
I really need to find a new
place to go for coffee.


894
00:37:10.697 --> 00:37:13.363
When are you gonna let this feud
between us go?


895
00:37:13.363 --> 00:37:15.613
When you admit what you did.

896
00:37:15.613 --> 00:37:16.697
What did I do?

897
00:37:16.697 --> 00:37:17.780
You know.

898
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.030
What?

899
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.196
Start my own company?

900
00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.655
Want something for myself?

901
00:37:21.655 --> 00:37:24.030
Is this what you've been angry
about for the last couple years?


902
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.864
Why did you come here, Milo?

903
00:37:25.864 --> 00:37:30.030
Well, I was re-reading our
blog postings, both of them,


904
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.864
and I was actually feeling
a little bit...


905
00:37:34.864 --> 00:37:36.697
guilty about what we did.

906
00:37:36.697 --> 00:37:39.071
You? Guilty?

907
00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:41.905
Is this being recorded for
one of those prank shows?


908
00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:43.989
Alison, I'm serious.

909
00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:46.780
Look, our sites may not be
New York Times,


910
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.113
but should still have some level
of journalistic integrity,


911
00:37:50.113 --> 00:37:51.071
don't you think?

912
00:37:51.071 --> 00:37:53.238
Messing with the love lives
of two innocent people


913
00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:54.488
for our own personal gain

914
00:37:54.488 --> 00:37:56.947
is about as far from integrity
as you can get.


915
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:04.030
I hate it when you're right.

916
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.572
So tonight the date goes
how it goes,


917
00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:11.780
good or bad, we stay out of it.

918
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.530
Agreed?

919
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.196
Agreed.

920
00:38:16.488 --> 00:38:19.572
You know you're beautiful
when you compromise.


921
00:38:19.572 --> 00:38:21.321
Go away.

922
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:23.280
Enjoy your coffee.

923
00:38:33.363 --> 00:38:34.071
This is insane.

924
00:38:34.071 --> 00:38:35.405
He's just gonna try to mess
with me again


925
00:38:35.405 --> 00:38:36.572
like he did last time.

926
00:38:36.572 --> 00:38:38.071
Well, then you mess
with him first.


927
00:38:38.071 --> 00:38:40.655
Yeah, but doesn't that make
me just as bad as he is?


928
00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:41.864
Leigh, you have to make
a choice.


929
00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:46.321
Either take control or stay
here and hang out on the couch.


930
00:38:46.321 --> 00:38:48.864
Our couch is really comfortable.

931
00:38:48.864 --> 00:38:52.071
Take control. Ok?

932
00:38:52.071 --> 00:38:53.822
Ok.

933
00:38:57.989 --> 00:38:59.739
I don't know what you're
so freaked out about.


934
00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:00.530
I'm going out on a date
with someone


935
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.864
who thinks I'm trying
to kill her.


936
00:39:01.864 --> 00:39:03.196
She doesn't really think that,

937
00:39:03.196 --> 00:39:05.613
she just thinks you're trying
to sabotage your dates.


938
00:39:07.196 --> 00:39:08.488
You know what,
maybe you should


939
00:39:08.488 --> 00:39:09.071
What? Why?

940
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:10.071
Because otherwise
you're gonna end up


941
00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:13.739
playing defense all night.

942
00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:17.447
Don't let her take advantage
of you like...


943
00:39:17.447 --> 00:39:19.447
Like Amy did.

944
00:39:19.447 --> 00:39:20.280
Yeah.

945
00:39:22.947 --> 00:39:25.572
You know what?

946
00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:27.405
No more playing defense.

947
00:39:40.488 --> 00:39:42.238
( simultaneous ) Sorry I'm late.

948
00:39:42.238 --> 00:39:42.989
I just got here.

949
00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:44.113
Yeah, so did I.

950
00:39:44.113 --> 00:39:45.530
So we're both late.

951
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.864
Yeah, we missed the start
of the movie.


952
00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:50.739
Ok, so what's plan B?

953
00:39:50.739 --> 00:39:51.780
Well, I mean, I was thinking
we could take


954
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.363
a paddle boat ride
on the lake.


955
00:39:53.363 --> 00:39:57.071
Lake? No, no lakes.

956
00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:59.113
Uh, maybe we could
just get coffee?


957
00:39:59.113 --> 00:40:00.030
Oh, coffee huh?

958
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.905
A room full of hot liquids?

959
00:40:00.905 --> 00:40:03.030
No, no, no. I don't think so.

960
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.572
But there is a bar around
the corner that has karaoke.


961
00:40:05.572 --> 00:40:07.113
So I can embarrass myself
in public?


962
00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:08.363
No thank you.

963
00:40:08.363 --> 00:40:09.363
Ice skating?

964
00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:11.071
No, I don't want to end up
in a cast, no, no.


965
00:40:11.071 --> 00:40:13.405
So what're we gonna do?

966
00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:14.947
Maybe we could just...

967
00:40:14.947 --> 00:40:18.864
I don't know, go for a walk
or something?


968
00:40:18.864 --> 00:40:20.363
A walk?

969
00:40:20.363 --> 00:40:22.655
It'd be fun.

970
00:40:22.655 --> 00:40:24.030
Ok.

971
00:40:26.488 --> 00:40:27.530
Yeah.

972
00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:03.363
Woah.

973
00:41:59.822 --> 00:42:02.030
So how'd you get involved
with Bad Date Chronicles?


974
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.739
Uh, happenstance mainly.

975
00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:07.280
I got hired to be a copy editor
for the site


976
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.238
but then I had this really,
really epic break-up


977
00:42:09.238 --> 00:42:10.780
around the time they were
looking for someone


978
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.572
to run the blog.

979
00:42:12.572 --> 00:42:13.864
It seemed like a natural fit.

980
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.947
Had a few bad dates yourself,
huh?


981
00:42:15.947 --> 00:42:17.822
I mean, other than ours.

982
00:42:17.822 --> 00:42:20.530
More like bad relationships.

983
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.655
I kinda just wanted to forget
about it.


984
00:42:22.655 --> 00:42:24.697
Work on something happy
and upbeat


985
00:42:24.697 --> 00:42:25.989
but the site didn't have a blog

986
00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:27.947
for puppies and rainbows,
so...


987
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.697
How about you and trends?

988
00:42:34.697 --> 00:42:36.071
You know, in a way
it was the same thing.


989
00:42:36.071 --> 00:42:38.572
I was writing a sports blog,
went through a bad break-up


990
00:42:38.572 --> 00:42:42.822
and just decided that I needed
to write about something else.


991
00:42:42.822 --> 00:42:44.155
Why?

992
00:42:44.155 --> 00:42:45.822
Oh, did I not tell you that
she was a sports caster


993
00:42:45.822 --> 00:42:47.196
of a local TV station?

994
00:42:47.196 --> 00:42:49.947
Ah. Continue.

995
00:42:49.947 --> 00:42:52.405
So my college buddy, Brad,
hooked me up with this gig


996
00:42:52.405 --> 00:42:55.071
at The Peters Post by telling
them that I was super trendy


997
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:58.155
and cutting edge on
all the latest everything.


998
00:42:58.155 --> 00:42:59.155
And you weren't?

999
00:42:59.155 --> 00:43:02.321
No. No, my car was seven years
old and I had the same haircut


1000
00:43:02.321 --> 00:43:03.280
since I was 15.

1001
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.864
( laughs )

1002
00:43:04.864 --> 00:43:06.822
You know that saying
"fake it 'til you make it"?


1003
00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:07.697
Yes.

1004
00:43:07.697 --> 00:43:09.572
Yeah, well, I was really good
at faking it.


1005
00:43:09.572 --> 00:43:11.905
( laughs )

1006
00:43:11.905 --> 00:43:14.280
So I guess our break-ups
were good for something.


1007
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.613
They got us jobs.

1008
00:43:15.613 --> 00:43:16.905
Yeah, I guess they did.

1009
00:43:16.905 --> 00:43:17.905
( Conner ): I mean, there's
that whole


1010
00:43:17.905 --> 00:43:21.363
nability to trust anyone"
g to balance it out, but...


1011
00:43:21.363 --> 00:43:22.739
( Leigh ): So you want to give
ice skating a try?


1012
00:43:22.739 --> 00:43:25.280
( Conner ): I will
if you will.


1013
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:25.905
( knocking )

1014
00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:26.697
( gasps )

1015
00:43:30.822 --> 00:43:32.113
So much for integrity.

1016
00:43:32.113 --> 00:43:33.530
I was just watching.

1017
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.530
What are you doing here?

1018
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.363
Same. 15 million views
at stake here.


1019
00:43:38.363 --> 00:43:39.739
Well, we don't have to worry
about that anymore.


1020
00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:42.238
These two are on the most
boring date ever.


1021
00:43:42.238 --> 00:43:43.405
They're on a walk-and-talk.

1022
00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:44.405
I mean, come on!

1023
00:43:44.405 --> 00:43:46.447
This is not Bad Date Chronicle
worthy.


1024
00:43:46.447 --> 00:43:47.071
But what do we do?

1025
00:43:47.071 --> 00:43:48.530
We agreed not to interfere.

1026
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.530
Yes, we did.

1027
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:51.655
Because that

1028
00:43:51.655 --> 00:43:53.447
( simultaneous )
would be bad.


1029
00:43:53.447 --> 00:43:54.613
Yeah.

1030
00:43:58.864 --> 00:44:00.655
Although...

1031
00:44:00.655 --> 00:44:01.780
I'm listening.

1032
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.447
A bad date is not just
in our best interest,


1033
00:44:04.447 --> 00:44:05.655
it's also in theirs.

1034
00:44:05.655 --> 00:44:06.572
Go on.

1035
00:44:06.572 --> 00:44:09.739
A bad date means
more page views,


1036
00:44:09.739 --> 00:44:12.864
which means higher profile,

1037
00:44:12.864 --> 00:44:16.196
which means better jobs
and more money for them.


1038
00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:17.822
This could be their
first step towards


1039
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:19.613
starting their own
online magazine.


1040
00:44:19.613 --> 00:44:20.530
Exactly.

1041
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:21.697
We kind of owe it to them
to interfere.


1042
00:44:21.697 --> 00:44:22.530
Yep.

1043
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:23.530
We are their mentors.

1044
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.321
And you know what,
mentors have integrity.


1045
00:44:25.321 --> 00:44:26.071
Yes.

1046
00:44:26.071 --> 00:44:27.739
So what are we waiting for?

1047
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.196
Alison?

1048
00:44:30.196 --> 00:44:31.071
What?

1049
00:44:31.071 --> 00:44:32.238
You're beautiful
when you compromise


1050
00:44:32.238 --> 00:44:34.196
but you're gorgeous
when you're devious.


1051
00:44:34.196 --> 00:44:36.864
Let's just break up a date,
please.


1052
00:44:38.447 --> 00:44:48.447
( upbeat music ) ♪♪

1053
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:12.530
♪

1054
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.739
( drill buzzing )

1055
00:45:38.697 --> 00:45:41.030
Leigh, how does it feel?

1056
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.321
How does what feel?

1057
00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:43.780
To be a winner?

1058
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.822
Your write-up of last night's
date is out-pacing


1059
00:45:45.822 --> 00:45:49.405
The Peters Post version
by 30 percent.


1060
00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:51.572
We are gonna crush them
on the next date.


1061
00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:53.905
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.


1062
00:45:53.905 --> 00:45:56.321
I don't think there's gonna be
a next date.


1063
00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:58.321
Why don't you have a seat?

1064
00:46:05.405 --> 00:46:06.697
What do you mean?

1065
00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:09.280
I mean, he can't be that bad,
can he?


1066
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.405
No, he's not.

1067
00:46:10.405 --> 00:46:12.155
He actually seems like
a decent guy,


1068
00:46:12.155 --> 00:46:14.238
and in between all the horrible
stuff we were having fun.


1069
00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:14.947
But...

1070
00:46:17.321 --> 00:46:19.697
Alison, I think another
date is gonna kill me.


1071
00:46:19.697 --> 00:46:21.864
Leigh, I have been seeing you
in a whole new light


1072
00:46:21.864 --> 00:46:23.363
since this all started.

1073
00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:25.321
Smart. Funny.

1074
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:26.697
Talented.

1075
00:46:26.697 --> 00:46:29.447
Wait, how did you see me before?

1076
00:46:29.447 --> 00:46:31.030
Honestly, you were fine.

1077
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.572
Fine is fine, but
it's not amazing,


1078
00:46:32.572 --> 00:46:34.655
and since you've been sharing
your stories


1079
00:46:34.655 --> 00:46:36.864
you've been amazing.

1080
00:46:36.864 --> 00:46:37.447
Really?

1081
00:46:37.447 --> 00:46:39.989
Yes.

1082
00:46:39.989 --> 00:46:41.697
"If he's not intentionally
trying to make these dates


1083
00:46:41.697 --> 00:46:43.655
"a nightmare then I'm pretty
sure one of us has picked up


1084
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:46.405
"an ancient Tiki necklace
on a family trip to Hawaii,


1085
00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:48.739
"because we are cursed"?

1086
00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.739
That's funny.

1087
00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:54.196
I see big things for you
at The Richards Record.


1088
00:46:54.196 --> 00:46:55.697
But can't I write
about something else?


1089
00:46:55.697 --> 00:46:58.071
Something that doesn't involve
the threat of imminent death?


1090
00:46:58.071 --> 00:47:00.655
I'm sure you could,
but how are you gonna feel


1091
00:47:00.655 --> 00:47:03.613
if you don't see this
all the way through?


1092
00:47:03.613 --> 00:47:04.613
Relieved.

1093
00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:06.363
Like a quitter.

1094
00:47:06.363 --> 00:47:08.113
Nobody wants to be a quitter.

1095
00:47:08.113 --> 00:47:11.613
I know I don't.

1096
00:47:11.613 --> 00:47:17.697
Uh, I don't think you have as
much at stake in this as I do.


1097
00:47:17.697 --> 00:47:19.613
You might be right.

1098
00:47:23.321 --> 00:47:25.196
Thank you for the talk,
Leigh.


1099
00:47:25.196 --> 00:47:27.780
I look forward to your
next write up.


1100
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:34.989
What just happened?

1101
00:47:47.405 --> 00:47:49.071
Peters Post.

1102
00:48:04.697 --> 00:48:06.030
She thinks I sank the boat.

1103
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.363
I know.

1104
00:48:06.363 --> 00:48:07.530
But I did not sink
the boat.


1105
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.613
I know, but the boat sank
and so if I was your girlfriend-


1106
00:48:11.613 --> 00:48:13.030
She's not my girlfriend,
ok?


1107
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.280
And it is not my fault.

1108
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.739
It's gotta be someone's fault.

1109
00:48:15.739 --> 00:48:17.030
But it shouldn't be me, ok?

1110
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.363
Leigh is literally trying to
blame me for every single thing.


1111
00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:21.488
I did not break
the karaoke machine


1112
00:48:21.488 --> 00:48:24.447
and I most certainly
did not sink the boat!


1113
00:48:24.447 --> 00:48:25.989
Do you think
your girlfriend did?


1114
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:27.530
Stop calling her that.

1115
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.488
I don't know, ok?

1116
00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:30.947
It doesn't seem like her,
but it can't all be coincidence.


1117
00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:33.447
Nobody goes on three dates
in a row like that.


1118
00:48:33.447 --> 00:48:35.363
So what're you gonna do
about it?


1119
00:48:39.447 --> 00:48:40.155
Where are you going?

1120
00:48:40.155 --> 00:48:42.113
To go break up
with my girlfriend.


1121
00:48:42.113 --> 00:48:43.071
Ah hah!

1122
00:48:43.071 --> 00:48:44.989
I told you she was
your girlfriend!


1123
00:48:56.071 --> 00:48:57.613
You're late.

1124
00:48:57.613 --> 00:49:00.363
I'm not late, I'm varying
my routine.


1125
00:49:00.363 --> 00:49:02.447
Same coffee house,
same coffee.


1126
00:49:02.447 --> 00:49:04.530
You're just ten minutes
later than usual.


1127
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.780
I got a different drink, too.

1128
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.989
Looks the same to me.

1129
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:08.155
It's only half caf.

1130
00:49:08.155 --> 00:49:10.155
You are a madwoman.

1131
00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:11.613
Totally out of control.

1132
00:49:11.613 --> 00:49:14.280
Anyway, I was talking
to Leigh


1133
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.947
and she made an interesting
point.


1134
00:49:16.947 --> 00:49:18.780
What's that?

1135
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.155
That the stakes aren't
high enough for me


1136
00:49:20.155 --> 00:49:22.780
in this little competition
we have going on.


1137
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.196
Ok. What were you thinking?

1138
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.989
Your business card?

1139
00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:33.405
I don't think that's worth
the four dollars


1140
00:49:33.405 --> 00:49:34.739
our double or nothing
bet is up to-


1141
00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:36.113
Not the card.

1142
00:49:36.113 --> 00:49:38.405
The business.

1143
00:49:38.405 --> 00:49:40.280
I was doing a little research.

1144
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.613
The Richards Record
has women 18 - 49.


1145
00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:45.321
Peters Post has men.

1146
00:49:45.321 --> 00:49:48.280
Separately we do fine.

1147
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.447
But together we could
be amazing.


1148
00:49:52.447 --> 00:49:53.864
You want us to merge?

1149
00:49:53.864 --> 00:49:56.697
Yes.

1150
00:49:56.697 --> 00:49:59.488
As partners?

1151
00:49:59.488 --> 00:50:01.905
That's where the wager
comes in.


1152
00:50:01.905 --> 00:50:04.697
If we get more hits
on the next date post,


1153
00:50:04.697 --> 00:50:07.447
you work for me.

1154
00:50:07.447 --> 00:50:11.905
If you get more hits,
I work for you.


1155
00:50:11.905 --> 00:50:13.613
You're serious?

1156
00:50:13.613 --> 00:50:17.238
Very.

1157
00:50:17.238 --> 00:50:19.155
You're on.

1158
00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:33.113
Conner.

1159
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.113
I can't believe you think
I'm that much of a monster.


1160
00:50:35.113 --> 00:50:35.780
Do you mind?

1161
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.321
I
- I work here.

1162
00:50:40.155 --> 00:50:41.238
What're you talking about?

1163
00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.572
Your Bad Date Chronicle
where you called me a sociopath.


1164
00:50:43.572 --> 00:50:44.113
I did not.

1165
00:50:44.113 --> 00:50:44.989
You may as well have.

1166
00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:46.238
I mean, sabotage?

1167
00:50:46.238 --> 00:50:47.405
Food tampering?

1168
00:50:47.405 --> 00:50:48.196
Maritime disasters?

1169
00:50:48.196 --> 00:50:49.655
If I wasn't so offended
I would be impressed


1170
00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:51.321
that you thought I had
that much power.


1171
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.196
So, what?

1172
00:50:52.196 --> 00:50:55.071
You just expect me to believe
all this was just happenstance?


1173
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:56.488
No, I don't think that at all.

1174
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:57.447
So I'm the sociopath?

1175
00:50:57.447 --> 00:50:58.613
Well, if the straight
jacket fits.


1176
00:50:58.613 --> 00:50:59.405
It wasn't me.

1177
00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:00.613
Well, it wasn't me, either.

1178
00:51:00.613 --> 00:51:02.989
If it wasn't you and it
wasn't me, who was it?


1179
00:51:07.613 --> 00:51:08.822
Oh great.

1180
00:51:08.822 --> 00:51:10.739
Uh, that's my boss.

1181
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:11.739
That's my boss.

1182
00:51:11.739 --> 00:51:12.822
Wait a minute.

1183
00:51:12.822 --> 00:51:14.030
That's Milo Peters?

1184
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.405
Yeah. That's Alison Richards?

1185
00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.947
Yes.

1186
00:51:16.947 --> 00:51:19.447
What're they doing together?

1187
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.780
( Both ): Oh.

1188
00:51:31.447 --> 00:51:33.655
Brad?

1189
00:51:33.655 --> 00:51:34.947
Erin.

1190
00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:35.947
What're you doing here?

1191
00:51:35.947 --> 00:51:37.488
I'm meeting someone.

1192
00:51:37.488 --> 00:51:38.530
Me too.

1193
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.572
Go away.

1194
00:51:39.572 --> 00:51:40.655
What do you mean, go away?

1195
00:51:40.655 --> 00:51:42.155
I mean you're going to ruin it.

1196
00:51:42.155 --> 00:51:43.113
How am I gonna ruin it?

1197
00:51:43.113 --> 00:51:45.155
I don't know but I'm sure
you'll find a way.


1198
00:51:45.155 --> 00:51:46.697
Well, then maybe you should go.

1199
00:51:46.697 --> 00:51:47.739
I'm not leaving.

1200
00:51:47.739 --> 00:51:49.280
I'm not either.

1201
00:51:52.071 --> 00:51:53.405
Red shirt.

1202
00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:57.739
Singlesurfer?

1203
00:51:57.739 --> 00:51:59.238
Foodiefan?

1204
00:51:59.238 --> 00:52:00.405
No!

1205
00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:02.196
No!

1206
00:52:06.488 --> 00:52:07.864
It makes so much sense.

1207
00:52:07.864 --> 00:52:10.071
I was feeling so...

1208
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:10.947
Inept.

1209
00:52:10.947 --> 00:52:11.905
Yes!

1210
00:52:11.905 --> 00:52:13.196
Like I not only forgot
how to date


1211
00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.822
but was actually
really bad at it.


1212
00:52:14.822 --> 00:52:16.655
Like bodily harm bad.

1213
00:52:16.655 --> 00:52:17.321
I know.

1214
00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:19.739
I mean, I realize I shouldn't
wrap up my sense of self-worth


1215
00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:21.947
in this stereotypical
guy thing


1216
00:52:21.947 --> 00:52:24.113
of how women respond to me
on dates, but...


1217
00:52:24.113 --> 00:52:25.697
But it wasn't us,
it was them.


1218
00:52:25.697 --> 00:52:26.238
Yeah.

1219
00:52:26.238 --> 00:52:27.113
You know what?

1220
00:52:27.113 --> 00:52:28.030
They're the sociopaths.

1221
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.655
Yeah.

1222
00:52:28.655 --> 00:52:29.488
They sank our boat.

1223
00:52:29.488 --> 00:52:31.447
They lit me on fire, twice.

1224
00:52:31.447 --> 00:52:32.071
Once.

1225
00:52:32.071 --> 00:52:34.989
I mean, the first time was
before they got involved, but...


1226
00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:36.989
Well, I say we blame
them anyway.


1227
00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:38.071
That works for me.

1228
00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:40.947
( laughs )

1229
00:52:40.947 --> 00:52:42.030
So what're we gonna do?

1230
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.488
We were supposed to go
on a date this weekend.


1231
00:52:43.488 --> 00:52:45.155
Yeah, it's supposed to be
our last date and frankly


1232
00:52:45.155 --> 00:52:46.905
I don't think I want to know
what they have in mind


1233
00:52:46.905 --> 00:52:48.321
for a grand finale.

1234
00:52:48.321 --> 00:52:51.530
Yeah, that's definitely
not gonna end well for us.


1235
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.697
Yeah.

1236
00:52:53.697 --> 00:52:56.822
You know, unless...

1237
00:52:56.822 --> 00:52:58.071
they can't mess with our date
if they don't know


1238
00:52:58.071 --> 00:53:00.405
when it's happening.

1239
00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:02.113
But they already do.

1240
00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:03.280
Not if we change it.

1241
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.572
Oh, I like it.

1242
00:53:04.572 --> 00:53:07.947
Change it to when?

1243
00:53:07.947 --> 00:53:09.405
Right now?

1244
00:53:11.572 --> 00:53:12.155
Let's do it. Let's just go.

1245
00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:14.196
Let's go blow off the rest
of work,


1246
00:53:14.196 --> 00:53:16.572
go completely off the record.

1247
00:53:16.572 --> 00:53:19.238
Re-do all our bad dates
and make them good.


1248
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:19.905
You know?

1249
00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:20.613
Just prove to ourselves

1250
00:53:20.613 --> 00:53:24.655
that we're not Bad Date
Chronicles material.


1251
00:53:24.655 --> 00:53:27.155
Let's do it.

1252
00:53:27.155 --> 00:53:28.989
Perfect.

1253
00:53:48.488 --> 00:53:49.780
Did you know?

1254
00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.363
Know what?

1255
00:53:51.363 --> 00:53:52.363
That I was me?

1256
00:53:52.363 --> 00:53:53.780
That she was me?

1257
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.947
The one you were chatting-
you know what I mean.


1258
00:53:55.947 --> 00:53:58.155
No, I- we talked about Leigh
and Conner's dates


1259
00:53:58.155 --> 00:54:00.488
and you never said anything
about knowing them.


1260
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:02.530
I wanted to know
what you really thought.


1261
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:06.697
I figured if you knew I knew
her you'd censor your answers.


1262
00:54:06.697 --> 00:54:09.238
Yeah, me too.

1263
00:54:09.238 --> 00:54:13.280
But you defended Leigh online.

1264
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.321
I didn't want to admit that
I thought my friend was being-


1265
00:54:15.321 --> 00:54:16.697
Lame?

1266
00:54:16.697 --> 00:54:19.405
Something like that.

1267
00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:20.655
I read both sides of it
and I thought Leigh


1268
00:54:20.655 --> 00:54:22.071
was making a better case.

1269
00:54:22.071 --> 00:54:23.947
Don't tell her I said that.

1270
00:54:23.947 --> 00:54:25.113
I won't.

1271
00:54:25.113 --> 00:54:27.697
So why didn't you say anything
in our chats?


1272
00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:29.280
Because I'm her friend.

1273
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.155
It's in the job description
to defend her.


1274
00:54:31.155 --> 00:54:32.196
I get it.

1275
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:37.155
So what now?

1276
00:54:37.155 --> 00:54:40.030
Because as much as I may
have liked Singlesurfer,


1277
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:42.739
you in person has been-

1278
00:54:42.739 --> 00:54:45.989
Yeah, the feeling is mutual.

1279
00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:50.655
Well, I guess that's that then.

1280
00:54:50.655 --> 00:54:52.363
I guess so.

1281
00:54:57.655 --> 00:54:58.989
No way. Seriously?

1282
00:54:58.989 --> 00:55:01.655
When I was a kid I wanted to be
the governor of Ohio.


1283
00:55:01.655 --> 00:55:02.864
Not the president?

1284
00:55:02.864 --> 00:55:03.905
No. No, that's too scary.

1285
00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:05.572
I mean, with the president
you have


1286
00:55:05.572 --> 00:55:06.739
to deal with things like war.

1287
00:55:06.739 --> 00:55:08.071
With the governor you get

1288
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.530
all the cool stuff
the president does,


1289
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:11.989
like the car and the body guards
and the cool code name


1290
00:55:11.989 --> 00:55:13.488
but you don't have to worry
about whether or not


1291
00:55:13.488 --> 00:55:14.864
Michigan's gonna attack.

1292
00:55:14.864 --> 00:55:16.071
That's a good point.

1293
00:55:16.071 --> 00:55:16.822
What about you?

1294
00:55:16.822 --> 00:55:18.280
What'd you want to be
when you grew up?


1295
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.739
Oh, I did the little
girl trifecta.


1296
00:55:19.739 --> 00:55:22.530
Princess, ballerina,
or a doggy doctor.


1297
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:23.280
Nice.

1298
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.238
Mmm, yes.

1299
00:55:24.238 --> 00:55:26.363
But unfortunately I realized
I wasn't born into royalty,


1300
00:55:26.363 --> 00:55:28.113
I have two left feet
and our dog Skipper


1301
00:55:28.113 --> 00:55:30.697
didn't go live
on a farm upstate.


1302
00:55:30.697 --> 00:55:31.947
Bloom was off the rules
on all of them.


1303
00:55:31.947 --> 00:55:33.363
Understandable.

1304
00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.196
Hey, can I ask you something?

1305
00:55:35.196 --> 00:55:37.780
Yeah, of course.

1306
00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:43.155
If our first date hadn't
crashed and burned...


1307
00:55:43.155 --> 00:55:46.113
Ah, I see what you did there.

1308
00:55:46.113 --> 00:55:49.071
Would you have wanted to go out
with me again?


1309
00:55:49.071 --> 00:55:50.613
I think so.

1310
00:55:51.989 --> 00:55:55.363
Ok. Why?

1311
00:55:55.363 --> 00:55:58.155
Because I thought you were
a nice guy.


1312
00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:00.238
Despite everything that happened
I couldn't stop thinking


1313
00:56:00.238 --> 00:56:03.655
that you were nice I...

1314
00:56:03.655 --> 00:56:06.405
I didn't get a lot of nice
with my ex-boyfriend,


1315
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:11.196
so nice was a nice change
of pace.


1316
00:56:11.196 --> 00:56:12.113
Well, you know, 
I was relieved

1317
00:56:12.113 --> 00:56:15.280
when I thought I'd never have
to see you again.


1318
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:15.905
Oh.

1319
00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:17.363
But, I mean, listen.

1320
00:56:17.363 --> 00:56:21.530
I was... I was disappointed,
you know?


1321
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:25.280
Like I was missing out
on something special.


1322
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.655
Oh.

1323
00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:31.196
It's been a long time
since I've felt that way.


1324
00:56:31.196 --> 00:56:32.238
You know, it's been
over an hour


1325
00:56:32.238 --> 00:56:33.864
and nothing horrible
has happened.


1326
00:56:33.864 --> 00:56:34.655
No, no, no.

1327
00:56:34.655 --> 00:56:36.155
Don't, don't jinx it.

1328
00:56:36.155 --> 00:56:38.238
( giggles )

1329
00:56:38.238 --> 00:56:40.280
Hazards everywhere.

1330
00:56:44.447 --> 00:56:45.822
There's no way this could work.

1331
00:56:45.822 --> 00:56:46.321
I know.

1332
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:47.405
Our best friends
hate each other.


1333
00:56:47.405 --> 00:56:47.905
I know.

1334
00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:49.280
You and I hate each other.

1335
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.780
I don't know about hate...

1336
00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.113
We certainly don't
like each other.


1337
00:56:53.113 --> 00:56:56.363
But Foodiefan
and Singlesurfer do.


1338
00:56:56.363 --> 00:57:00.405
I mean, I think they do.

1339
00:57:00.405 --> 00:57:03.488
They do.

1340
00:57:03.488 --> 00:57:04.822
But that's not real life.

1341
00:57:04.822 --> 00:57:10.447
That's bits and bytes and
data and hiding behind personas


1342
00:57:10.447 --> 00:57:15.739
that aren't who we really are.

1343
00:57:15.739 --> 00:57:18.030
And even if they were,

1344
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.822
we don't know if they could
have worked.


1345
00:57:26.864 --> 00:57:28.613
So.

1346
00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.780
So.

1347
00:57:35.488 --> 00:57:37.113
I'm gonna go.

1348
00:57:37.113 --> 00:57:38.655
Yeah, me too.

1349
00:57:43.238 --> 00:57:45.030
For the record,

1350
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.447
I think Singlesurfer and
Foodiefan would have made it.


1351
00:58:00.405 --> 00:58:10.405
( upbeat music )♪♪

1352
00:59:00.613 --> 00:59:03.030
( phone rings )

1353
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:04.071
Alison Richards.

1354
00:59:04.071 --> 00:59:05.822
Working late as usual?

1355
00:59:05.822 --> 00:59:07.405
Just making sure everything
is in order


1356
00:59:07.405 --> 00:59:09.321
for when you come work
at the Richards Record.


1357
00:59:09.321 --> 00:59:10.238
What a coincidence.

1358
00:59:10.238 --> 00:59:11.822
I was just figuring out
where you're gonna sit


1359
00:59:11.822 --> 00:59:13.989
when you come to work
at The Peters Post.


1360
00:59:13.989 --> 00:59:15.780
I do enjoy our little chats.

1361
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.155
As do I.

1362
00:59:17.155 --> 00:59:19.071
So are we really gonna
do this?


1363
00:59:19.071 --> 00:59:20.488
Merge our two companies?

1364
00:59:20.488 --> 00:59:22.447
I've run the numbers ten times
and I keep coming up


1365
00:59:22.447 --> 00:59:24.030
with the same answer.

1366
00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:25.530
We're better together
than we are apart.


1367
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.697
We always were.

1368
00:59:26.697 --> 00:59:30.071
Are you really ready to let
this go?


1369
00:59:30.071 --> 00:59:32.113
I've been doing this
a long time.


1370
00:59:32.113 --> 00:59:33.780
I started this blog
before people really knew


1371
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.780
what a blog was.

1372
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.155
It's been my life.

1373
00:59:37.155 --> 00:59:37.739
I know.

1374
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:40.280
I was there every day and I
saw how important it is to you.


1375
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.405
Yes, it is.

1376
00:59:42.405 --> 00:59:43.488
But when Leigh told me

1377
00:59:43.488 --> 00:59:46.280
that the stakes weren't
high enough for me


1378
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.739
I realized she was right.

1379
00:59:48.739 --> 00:59:52.280
Things around here have
been routine.


1380
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.739
What, you switched
to half caf?


1381
00:59:53.739 --> 00:59:55.321
When the thought of betting
Richards Record


1382
00:59:55.321 --> 00:59:57.113
first popped into my mind

1383
00:59:57.113 --> 01:00:00.572
my first thought
wasn't "that's ridiculous".


1384
01:00:00.572 --> 01:00:03.905
It was "why doesn't
that sound ridiculous?"


1385
01:00:06.697 --> 01:00:08.822
I wouldn't have made this bet
if on some level at least


1386
01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:11.864
I wasn't prepared to lose.

1387
01:00:11.864 --> 01:00:12.822
Ok.

1388
01:00:12.822 --> 01:00:14.238
But I am gonna win.

1389
01:00:14.238 --> 01:00:15.196
Ok.

1390
01:00:15.196 --> 01:00:18.530
How are you gonna feel
when that happens?


1391
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.989
Let's just say you're not
the only one looking for


1392
01:00:19.989 --> 01:00:22.697
a little change in routine.

1393
01:00:22.697 --> 01:00:26.530
So I guess we should
talk about logistics.


1394
01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:30.363
Absolutely.

1395
01:00:30.363 --> 01:00:31.155
( laughing )

1396
01:00:31.155 --> 01:00:31.905
It was bad.

1397
01:00:31.905 --> 01:00:33.905
So bad.

1398
01:00:33.905 --> 01:00:35.447
( laughing )

1399
01:00:35.447 --> 01:00:37.947
Well, here we are.

1400
01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:39.363
Do you want me to escort
you home?


1401
01:00:39.363 --> 01:00:42.822
Uh, my car's here, so...
I could give you a ride.


1402
01:00:42.822 --> 01:00:44.488
Oh, no, it's good.
I drove here.


1403
01:00:44.488 --> 01:00:47.155
I'm good.

1404
01:00:47.155 --> 01:00:49.071
I uh, I had a great time.

1405
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:51.572
So did I.

1406
01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:53.989
So the date's officially over,
right?


1407
01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.530
Right.

1408
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.155
So that means...

1409
01:00:57.155 --> 01:00:58.822
What?

1410
01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.697
We're not bad dates.

1411
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.572
Yeah, buddy! That's what
I'm talking about!


1412
01:01:04.572 --> 01:01:05.655
In your face!

1413
01:01:05.655 --> 01:01:06.780
We crush bad dates!

1414
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.530
We're good at dating!

1415
01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:11.864
( laughing )

1416
01:01:11.864 --> 01:01:14.030
So I... I have an idea.

1417
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.905
Ok.

1418
01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.321
I know this date was for us,
not our blogs, but...


1419
01:01:17.321 --> 01:01:18.739
It was a really good date.

1420
01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:21.113
It was, wasn't it?

1421
01:01:21.113 --> 01:01:23.739
And you think we should
tell people about it?


1422
01:01:23.739 --> 01:01:25.739
Yeah.

1423
01:01:25.739 --> 01:01:28.739
I would love for people to read
about a good date for once.


1424
01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:29.822
Ok.

1425
01:01:29.822 --> 01:01:30.697
Yeah, let's write it up tonight

1426
01:01:30.697 --> 01:01:32.363
and turn it in first thing
tomorrow.


1427
01:01:32.363 --> 01:01:34.447
Great. I can't wait to read it.

1428
01:01:34.447 --> 01:01:36.405
Me too.

1429
01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:39.822
Well, um... goodnight.

1430
01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.530
Goodnight.

1431
01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:46.530
If we write about
tonight's date,


1432
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:48.864
that means it was for work.

1433
01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:53.655
I want our first kiss to be
on a real date.


1434
01:01:53.655 --> 01:01:56.196
So we get a real date?

1435
01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:57.864
Well, we were so good at it.

1436
01:01:57.864 --> 01:02:00.739
It would be a waste of all
that dating talent not to.


1437
01:02:02.572 --> 01:02:03.321
Goodnight.

1438
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:04.572
Goodnight.

1439
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.697
Ok, you are
never gonna believe


1440
01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:22.071
the incredible day I've had!

1441
01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:26.363
Seriously, it's like I've lost
all my bad dating karma.


1442
01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:28.155
Erin, what's wrong?

1443
01:02:28.155 --> 01:02:31.030
I think I found all your bad
dating karma.


1444
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.780
Oh no. What happened?

1445
01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.572
Erin? Leigh's Erin?

1446
01:02:34.572 --> 01:02:36.363
Your mystery internet
soulmate was the woman


1447
01:02:36.363 --> 01:02:37.989
who kinda hates you?

1448
01:02:37.989 --> 01:02:40.196
That's the one.

1449
01:02:40.196 --> 01:02:41.864
I'm sorry, man.

1450
01:02:41.864 --> 01:02:43.363
Hey, what're you gonna do?

1451
01:02:43.363 --> 01:02:44.989
I can't do anything.

1452
01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:46.989
We'd obviously never
work out.


1453
01:02:46.989 --> 01:02:48.780
But you said you were
hitting it off online.


1454
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.030
That was before I knew
who he really was.


1455
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:51.989
I just wish there was some way

1456
01:02:51.989 --> 01:02:53.989
I could show her
who I really am.


1457
01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.864
Enough about me, though.

1458
01:02:58.864 --> 01:03:00.280
Um, how'd things go with Leigh?

1459
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:00.905
Incredible.

1460
01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:02.113
We had the best time.

1461
01:03:02.113 --> 01:03:02.697
Really?

1462
01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:03.405
Really.

1463
01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:05.196
It's amazing how much easier
dating someone is


1464
01:03:05.196 --> 01:03:08.572
when you don't have crazy
people trying to mess it up.


1465
01:03:08.572 --> 01:03:11.989
Milo Peters and Alison
Richards together?


1466
01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.196
I thought they hated each other.

1467
01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:15.822
Well, apparently they have
one thing in common, greed.


1468
01:03:15.822 --> 01:03:17.030
You know, our posts
about our horrible dates


1469
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.238
were getting huge numbers

1470
01:03:18.238 --> 01:03:20.363
so it made sense
that they wanted more.


1471
01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.989
So what're you gonna do?

1472
01:03:21.989 --> 01:03:23.613
We are gonna give them
what they want.


1473
01:03:23.613 --> 01:03:25.238
A third date.

1474
01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:32.530
Ok. Where do I start?

1475
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.864
Uh, I'm sorry?

1476
01:03:33.864 --> 01:03:35.196
Oh, you don't have
to apologize.


1477
01:03:35.196 --> 01:03:36.405
No, I meant you.

1478
01:03:36.405 --> 01:03:39.363
You're sorry, for intentionally
ruining our dates.


1479
01:03:39.363 --> 01:03:41.530
Um... yes?

1480
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.530
Alison.

1481
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.155
Your Bad Date Chronicles
have generated millions of hits


1482
01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.321
as far as revenue.

1483
01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:49.280
I don't even think our
accounting department


1484
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.739
has ever been asked
to count that high.


1485
01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:53.905
So no, I won't apologize
for making something popular


1486
01:03:53.905 --> 01:03:55.030
and successful.

1487
01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.780
Even if it meant I got hurt
in the process?


1488
01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.947
How did you get hurt?

1489
01:03:57.947 --> 01:03:58.989
I was on fire.

1490
01:03:58.989 --> 01:04:00.947
Oh, you really need to let
that go, Leigh.


1491
01:04:00.947 --> 01:04:02.989
Everybody else has.

1492
01:04:02.989 --> 01:04:03.864
Well, it's over now.

1493
01:04:03.864 --> 01:04:05.071
You have your final date piece,

1494
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:06.405
I have fulfilled my duties.

1495
01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:07.739
I can't print this.

1496
01:04:07.739 --> 01:04:08.697
Why not?

1497
01:04:08.697 --> 01:04:10.321
"It's easy to get distracted
by the things


1498
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:12.071
"that don't really matter,

1499
01:04:12.071 --> 01:04:14.447
"but that's what makes it all
the more exciting


1500
01:04:14.447 --> 01:04:16.447
"when you can see
past those distractions to find


1501
01:04:16.447 --> 01:04:19.905
"the real person
standing behind them."


1502
01:04:19.905 --> 01:04:20.989
Ugh.

1503
01:04:20.989 --> 01:04:23.405
Erin already pitched
the love stories blog.


1504
01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:24.697
Remember?

1505
01:04:24.697 --> 01:04:26.822
We don't do fiction.

1506
01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:27.780
It's not fiction.

1507
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.321
That was our date.

1508
01:04:29.321 --> 01:04:30.822
You prefer that I make
something up?


1509
01:04:30.822 --> 01:04:33.655
Say we had a horrible time
and there was like a plague


1510
01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:34.989
of locusts or something?

1511
01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:36.655
Plague of locusts.

1512
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.780
That's a little far-fetched,

1513
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.196
but I like where
you're going with this.


1514
01:04:41.196 --> 01:04:43.030
What if the restaurant
had cockroaches?


1515
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.113
I'm not doing this.

1516
01:04:45.113 --> 01:04:46.780
That is the date we had.

1517
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.321
If you want something else,
write it yourself.


1518
01:04:54.363 --> 01:04:57.447
Alright. I will.

1519
01:05:15.447 --> 01:05:19.447
So Alison really tried
to sabotage your date, huh?


1520
01:05:19.447 --> 01:05:20.572
Milo.

1521
01:05:20.572 --> 01:05:23.613
Ok, ok. We're terrible people.

1522
01:05:23.613 --> 01:05:25.113
But we had good reason.

1523
01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:25.905
Oh, you did?

1524
01:05:25.905 --> 01:05:26.739
Yes, money.

1525
01:05:26.739 --> 01:05:27.613
Ok.

1526
01:05:27.613 --> 01:05:31.530
What I meant is money
for the company.


1527
01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.572
To pay people's salaries.

1528
01:05:32.572 --> 01:05:33.405
Not just you and me,

1529
01:05:33.405 --> 01:05:35.530
I'm responsible for
all these people here


1530
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.655
and sometimes it's a little...

1531
01:05:38.655 --> 01:05:40.780
Scary?

1532
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.155
Intimidating.

1533
01:05:45.447 --> 01:05:47.488
And I feel the weight of
that responsibility every day,


1534
01:05:47.488 --> 01:05:50.196
and I guess it made me
a little crazy.


1535
01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:52.405
And I'm sorry.

1536
01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:54.697
Thank you.

1537
01:05:54.697 --> 01:05:57.739
This is really well-written.

1538
01:05:57.739 --> 01:06:00.030
You really like her, huh?

1539
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.238
I do.

1540
01:06:02.238 --> 01:06:04.530
Well, this isn't
what they want.


1541
01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:04.697
I don't know, Milo.

1542
01:06:04.697 --> 01:06:06.989
Doesn't everybody want a story
with a happy ending?


1543
01:06:06.989 --> 01:06:11.155
Yeah, for themselves,
but not other people.


1544
01:06:11.155 --> 01:06:13.447
But if this is what you want
to publish...


1545
01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:15.280
It is.

1546
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.780
Then this is what we'll publish.

1547
01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.488
Ok.

1548
01:06:20.488 --> 01:06:23.155
Just let me show it
to Alison first.


1549
01:06:23.155 --> 01:06:25.196
I don't want there to be
any surprises.


1550
01:06:25.196 --> 01:06:26.697
Ok. Milo, thank you.

1551
01:06:26.697 --> 01:06:29.488
I appreciate it.

1552
01:06:29.488 --> 01:06:32.530
Remember that when
we're all unemployed.


1553
01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.363
This is good.

1554
01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:42.447
This is really good.

1555
01:06:42.447 --> 01:06:46.613
This makes that fire stuff
look like child's play.


1556
01:06:46.613 --> 01:06:50.655
Bad Date Chronicles,
here we come.


1557
01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:52.530
And publish.

1558
01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:06.363
Aargh!

1559
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.321
Hey. Can we talk?

1560
01:07:16.321 --> 01:07:18.739
Milo. Yes, actually
we need to talk,


1561
01:07:18.739 --> 01:07:21.405
but I have to run out and find
Leigh really quickly.


1562
01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:23.238
Do you mind waiting for me?

1563
01:07:23.238 --> 01:07:23.947
Not at all.

1564
01:07:23.947 --> 01:07:25.613
I'll be right here.

1565
01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:05.155
I don't understand.

1566
01:08:05.155 --> 01:08:06.030
Conner.

1567
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:07.196
This is not her.

1568
01:08:07.196 --> 01:08:09.739
Everything matches
with what you said.


1569
01:08:09.739 --> 01:08:11.113
Instead of writing
a romantic comedy,


1570
01:08:11.113 --> 01:08:13.196
she wrote a horror movie.

1571
01:08:16.238 --> 01:08:16.947
"When he asked me

1572
01:08:16.947 --> 01:08:19.447
"if I thought I wanted
to go out with him again


1573
01:08:19.447 --> 01:08:21.947
"after the first date I
almost couldn't decide


1574
01:08:21.947 --> 01:08:26.321
"if I wanted to scream, laugh,
run away, or throw up.


1575
01:08:26.321 --> 01:08:29.113
"That I kept myself from
doing any of these things


1576
01:08:29.113 --> 01:08:34.071
"is nothing short of a miracle."

1577
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:36.989
Why would she do this?

1578
01:08:36.989 --> 01:08:39.363
I hate to say it but I think
you got played.


1579
01:08:42.905 --> 01:08:45.572
This way she can write her
Bad Date Chronicles,


1580
01:08:45.572 --> 01:08:48.655
you look like a fool,
she gets all the hits,


1581
01:08:48.655 --> 01:08:50.447
we get left with nothing.

1582
01:08:54.905 --> 01:08:58.530
I really thought she liked me,
you know?


1583
01:08:58.530 --> 01:08:59.989
Sorry, man.

1584
01:09:04.655 --> 01:09:07.155
You haven't published
my story yet, have you?


1585
01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:11.155
Good. I think it needs
a few revisions.


1586
01:09:29.572 --> 01:09:31.280
Yes.

1587
01:09:36.196 --> 01:09:38.822
You have a food problem?

1588
01:09:46.864 --> 01:09:49.655
I always lose my appetite
when I feel like I've messed up


1589
01:09:49.655 --> 01:09:51.739
something important.

1590
01:09:54.447 --> 01:09:56.989
Maybe you didn't mess it up.

1591
01:09:56.989 --> 01:10:01.280
Maybe someone else
messed it up.


1592
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.238
Maybe we both did?

1593
01:10:04.238 --> 01:10:06.071
But I presume
you heard about


1594
01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:07.864
Leigh and Conner's date
last night?


1595
01:10:07.864 --> 01:10:09.113
Yes, it went great!

1596
01:10:09.113 --> 01:10:12.238
So I figured, you know, if they
could let bygones be bygones


1597
01:10:12.238 --> 01:10:16.155
and start over, then
maybe we could, too.


1598
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.280
( typing )

1599
01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.572
( message alert )

1600
01:10:27.572 --> 01:10:29.655
"What time can you
pick me up tonight?"


1601
01:10:35.238 --> 01:10:36.655
( message alert )

1602
01:10:36.655 --> 01:10:38.989
It wasn't me.

1603
01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:40.822
Oh, it's a news alert.

1604
01:10:40.822 --> 01:10:42.822
Conner just posted the write-up
of their date.


1605
01:10:46.613 --> 01:10:47.905
Uh oh.

1606
01:10:47.905 --> 01:10:50.113
"It turns out that our bad
dates really were my fault


1607
01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:51.780
"because I'm the one who was
willing to give her


1608
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.405
"the benefit of the doubt.

1609
01:10:53.405 --> 01:10:56.363
"I was willing to believe that
she was a decent human being."


1610
01:10:56.363 --> 01:10:57.238
Did you know about this?

1611
01:10:57.238 --> 01:10:57.905
No!

1612
01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:58.697
When I talked to him,
it was fine.


1613
01:10:58.697 --> 01:11:00.488
They had a great time,
everything was great.


1614
01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:01.572
Or maybe he was
just pretending that


1615
01:11:01.572 --> 01:11:03.405
so he could write
this hit piece.


1616
01:11:03.405 --> 01:11:05.655
No, Conner is not like that.

1617
01:11:05.655 --> 01:11:06.905
And what about you?

1618
01:11:06.905 --> 01:11:08.447
Coming over here all...

1619
01:11:08.447 --> 01:11:09.780
charming.

1620
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.780
I'm such an idiot.

1621
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:11.947
Where are you going?

1622
01:11:11.947 --> 01:11:13.488
I have to find Leigh.

1623
01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.613
( door opens )

1624
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:45.989
It's funny.

1625
01:11:45.989 --> 01:11:48.155
What is?

1626
01:11:48.155 --> 01:11:52.280
How fast it all comes back.

1627
01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.488
I really didn't think I had
gotten over my break-up


1628
01:11:54.488 --> 01:11:56.238
with Danny.

1629
01:11:56.238 --> 01:11:58.238
You said his name.

1630
01:11:58.238 --> 01:12:00.613
That's the thing.

1631
01:12:00.613 --> 01:12:03.655
I thought it would hurt too much
to say his name.


1632
01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:07.613
I thought I was still too hurt
by everything that had happened.


1633
01:12:07.613 --> 01:12:09.572
It's understandable.

1634
01:12:09.572 --> 01:12:11.321
But see? I wasn't.

1635
01:12:11.321 --> 01:12:12.864
I was better.

1636
01:12:12.864 --> 01:12:14.530
I felt better.

1637
01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:18.697
About myself, about my life,
about everything.


1638
01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:29.363
I just didn't realize it
until I read this.


1639
01:12:29.363 --> 01:12:32.196
Now I know how much better
I was


1640
01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:37.655
because now I remember
what it feels like to be hurt.


1641
01:12:37.655 --> 01:12:42.113
It comes back so fast.

1642
01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:45.155
It's funny, isn't it?

1643
01:12:45.155 --> 01:12:53.572
( sobbing )

1644
01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:03.780
You were just waiting
for an opportunity


1645
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.488
to stab me in the back,
weren't you?


1646
01:13:05.488 --> 01:13:08.280
Hold on a second.

1647
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.572
Somehow you're
the victim here?


1648
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.071
You know, I really gotta
give you credit for that.


1649
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:15.488
I was prepared to lose stuff.

1650
01:13:15.488 --> 01:13:17.405
That was a fantastic
performance.


1651
01:13:17.405 --> 01:13:20.405
Have a seat, please.

1652
01:13:20.405 --> 01:13:21.613
Let me guess.

1653
01:13:21.613 --> 01:13:23.989
Conner character assassination
piece?


1654
01:13:23.989 --> 01:13:25.196
All your idea, right?

1655
01:13:25.196 --> 01:13:27.780
Just like Leigh's hatchet job
was yours?


1656
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.113
What are you talking about?

1657
01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.363
We haven't posted anything.

1658
01:13:30.363 --> 01:13:34.071
Yeah, but I saw what
you were gonna post.


1659
01:13:34.071 --> 01:13:35.655
No!

1660
01:13:35.655 --> 01:13:37.613
Leigh didn't write this,
I did.


1661
01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:38.572
What?

1662
01:13:38.572 --> 01:13:44.447
Leigh wrote this really lovely,
sweet piece of fluff.


1663
01:13:44.447 --> 01:13:45.905
I couldn't let her post it.

1664
01:13:45.905 --> 01:13:48.447
So I wrote this and I was gonna
put it up instead.


1665
01:13:48.447 --> 01:13:51.405
But I changed my mind.

1666
01:13:51.405 --> 01:13:54.155
I don't believe you.

1667
01:13:54.155 --> 01:13:56.071
Where'd you find these papers,
Milo?


1668
01:13:56.071 --> 01:13:57.989
In the- in the trash.

1669
01:13:57.989 --> 01:13:59.113
Because that's where
I put them!


1670
01:13:59.113 --> 01:14:00.739
I threw it away!

1671
01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:04.363
I wasn't gonna post that.

1672
01:14:04.363 --> 01:14:06.196
And Conner's original piece
was about


1673
01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:08.030
how amazing their date was.

1674
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.572
And then I showed him this.

1675
01:14:09.572 --> 01:14:11.739
Of course you did.

1676
01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:13.238
We're terrible people.

1677
01:14:13.238 --> 01:14:14.822
The absolute worst.

1678
01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:16.030
I mean, they could
have been in love.


1679
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:17.488
Or at least headed that way.

1680
01:14:17.488 --> 01:14:18.613
And we ruined it.

1681
01:14:18.613 --> 01:14:20.655
Terrible, horrible people.

1682
01:14:20.655 --> 01:14:21.947
The worst.

1683
01:14:26.447 --> 01:14:28.030
Brad, get in here ASAP.

1684
01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:34.947
Yo.

1685
01:14:34.947 --> 01:14:39.947
Brad, we need your help.

1686
01:14:39.947 --> 01:14:42.071
What did you two do?

1687
01:14:59.405 --> 01:15:00.989
Erin?

1688
01:15:00.989 --> 01:15:02.613
Brad.

1689
01:15:02.613 --> 01:15:04.405
Get out!

1690
01:15:04.405 --> 01:15:06.363
And you!

1691
01:15:06.363 --> 01:15:07.989
Get out!

1692
01:15:07.989 --> 01:15:11.155
And you.

1693
01:15:11.155 --> 01:15:12.822
Well, you own the place so I
can't really tell you to get out


1694
01:15:12.822 --> 01:15:17.155
but I'm not very happy
with you, either.


1695
01:15:17.155 --> 01:15:18.447
That's fair.

1696
01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:21.530
Erin... just take a look
at these.


1697
01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:32.030
What did you do?

1698
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:33.947
It was them.

1699
01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:34.780
It's true.

1700
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.155
It's our fault.

1701
01:15:37.155 --> 01:15:40.196
But we just wanna know how
to fix it.


1702
01:15:40.196 --> 01:15:42.447
So what do we say?

1703
01:15:42.447 --> 01:15:44.155
How do we fix this?

1704
01:16:10.739 --> 01:16:11.780
Erin, I got your message.

1705
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.113
What...

1706
01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:32.655
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.


1707
01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:35.155
Just trust me, ok?

1708
01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:36.488
Ok.

1709
01:16:38.196 --> 01:16:39.196
Wow.

1710
01:16:39.196 --> 01:16:40.613
Amigo.

1711
01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:13.196
"My date with Conner
was unexpected.


1712
01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.822
"Not because it turns out
that he's charming and funny.


1713
01:17:15.822 --> 01:17:16.655
"I had gotten glimpses

1714
01:17:16.655 --> 01:17:20.071
"of those qualities on
our previous dates."


1715
01:17:20.071 --> 01:17:21.447
"No, the date with Conner
was unexpected


1716
01:17:21.447 --> 01:17:24.238
"because I realized that
our horrible dates were really


1717
01:17:24.238 --> 01:17:27.697
"our own faults.

1718
01:17:27.697 --> 01:17:29.363
"Our scars from past
relationships meant that


1719
01:17:29.363 --> 01:17:33.905
"we weren't willing to give each
other the benefit of the doubt."


1720
01:17:33.905 --> 01:17:35.780
"Leigh's willingness
to throw caution to the wind


1721
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.989
"and go out on a
spur-of-the-moment date


1722
01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:43.321
"made me look at her
in a whole new light."


1723
01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:45.613
"She not only accepted
this folly,


1724
01:17:45.613 --> 01:17:48.739
"she also embraced the chance
to jump off a very tall bridge


1725
01:17:48.739 --> 01:17:50.905
"with only a very thin
bungee cord


1726
01:17:50.905 --> 01:17:54.321
"and I admire her bravery."

1727
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:57.155
"Here's the thing about doubt.

1728
01:17:57.155 --> 01:17:59.363
"It's just a distraction.

1729
01:17:59.363 --> 01:18:00.780
"It's easy to get distracted
by the things


1730
01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.864
"that don't really matter

1731
01:18:01.864 --> 01:18:04.613
"but that's what makes it
all the more exciting


1732
01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.071
"when you can see past those
distractions to find


1733
01:18:06.071 --> 01:18:08.739
"the real person
standing behind them.


1734
01:18:11.572 --> 01:18:13.363
"I saw Conner for the first
time last night,


1735
01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:17.155
"and I hope it's not the last."

1736
01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:20.196
"Hands clammy, mouths dry,
hearts pounding.


1737
01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.530
"Leigh and I stood together
on the precipice,


1738
01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:26.697
"risking a fall but eagerly
anticipating the act of falling.


1739
01:18:26.697 --> 01:18:28.572
"And together we leapt."

1740
01:18:32.071 --> 01:18:34.780
You wrote this?

1741
01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:35.947
You?

1742
01:18:35.947 --> 01:18:40.280
Mmmhmm.

1743
01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.864
Can I ask you a question?

1744
01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:44.447
Ok.

1745
01:18:44.447 --> 01:18:48.280
Can we count this as
our first real date?


1746
01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.655
Sure.

1747
01:18:50.655 --> 01:18:55.196
Then why aren't you giving me
that goodnight kiss?


1748
01:18:55.196 --> 01:18:57.280
Because I'm not ready
to say goodnight.


1749
01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.905
Bradley, stop it.

1750
01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:12.822
Yeah, dude!

1751
01:19:12.822 --> 01:19:16.030
( laughing )

1752
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:17.363
Ok, ok.

1753
01:19:41.155 --> 01:19:42.488
Hey!

1754
01:19:42.488 --> 01:19:44.447
Woo!

1755
01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.196
A toast!

1756
01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:46.739
Somebody has to make
a toast.


1757
01:19:46.739 --> 01:19:49.280
I think Conner should go first.

1758
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.447
Ok.

1759
01:19:50.447 --> 01:19:51.739
Alright.

1760
01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:54.155
Well.

1761
01:19:54.155 --> 01:19:54.864
Thank you.

1762
01:19:54.864 --> 01:19:56.196
You're welcome.

1763
01:19:56.196 --> 01:20:01.905
To new beginnings, old friends,
and that's all I've got.


1764
01:20:01.905 --> 01:20:03.155
( laughs )

1765
01:20:03.155 --> 01:20:04.739
Wait, wait. I have one.

1766
01:20:04.739 --> 01:20:06.947
To the end of The Bad Date
Chronicles and the beginning


1767
01:20:06.947 --> 01:20:10.780
of the real love stories column,
non-fiction.


1768
01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.321
I have to hand it to you guys,
I didn't think anyone


1769
01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:14.822
would want to read
about that last date.


1770
01:20:14.822 --> 01:20:19.071
And who knew it would have
been our most popular post?


1771
01:20:19.071 --> 01:20:20.196
But enough of that
romantic stuff.


1772
01:20:20.196 --> 01:20:23.113
The real reason we're here
to celebrate.


1773
01:20:23.113 --> 01:20:26.280
A union between the Richards
Record and Peters Post.


1774
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.780
A partnership.

1775
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.864
To the Richards Peters Report.

1776
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:32.655
Wait a second.

1777
01:20:32.655 --> 01:20:34.113
Why does your name go first?

1778
01:20:36.447 --> 01:20:37.488
We talked about this.

1779
01:20:37.488 --> 01:20:40.196
Because my site has been
around a lot longer than yours.


1780
01:20:40.196 --> 01:20:41.697
Yeah, but I have a more
engaged audience.


1781
01:20:41.697 --> 01:20:42.488
Engaged?

1782
01:20:42.488 --> 01:20:44.405
Wait, my audience
is very engaged.


1783
01:20:44.405 --> 01:20:46.655
How long until they realize
they're in love with each other?


1784
01:20:46.655 --> 01:20:49.530
I think we should set them up
on a few bad dates.


1785
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.405
...so then my name
goes first-


1786
01:20:50.405 --> 01:20:53.155
Which is why we're here having
this partnership.


1787
01:20:53.155 --> 01:20:54.488
Why a bad date?

1788
01:20:54.488 --> 01:20:55.989
Because sometimes you need
a few bad dates


1789
01:20:55.989 --> 01:20:58.405
to know which ones
you really like.


1790
01:20:58.405 --> 01:21:00.447
...having this partnership.

1791
01:21:00.447 --> 01:21:04.071
( glasses clink )

1792
01:21:04.071 --> 01:21:04.822
Cheers.

1793
01:21:04.822 --> 01:21:06.321
( glasses clink )

1794
01:21:06.321 --> 01:21:08.405
( arguing continues )
