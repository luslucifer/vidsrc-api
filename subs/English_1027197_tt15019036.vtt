1
00:00:52.238 --> 00:00:53.696
It was a man's world.

2
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.696
The roles were assigned.
The cards were dealt.


3
00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:57.363
Men made the big money.

4
00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:00.238
We women kept in the background

5
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.863
and we were fine with it.

6
00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:02.738
Ten dollars!

7
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.821
Such were the times.

8
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.405
When I met Antek, he was
my professor at university.


9
00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:09.113
He dated my friend Helena.

10
00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:10.655
I was deeply impressed.

11
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.696
I had no idea
what he did after hours.

12
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.071
This is what I told you about.

13
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.863
Splendid.

14
00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:21.155
A Red dragon?

15
00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:24.113
Careful! It's an 18th century icon.

16
00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.946
Full discretion as discussed.

17
00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:35.280
It disappeared from police evidence,
so they won't look for it.


18
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:37.530
Would be embarrassing.

19
00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:50.321
This is what I told you about.

20
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:57.946
Careful! It's a 18th century work of art!

21
00:01:58.613 --> 00:01:59.696
Do you know what this is?

22
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.363
They say it's all about
the right time and place.


23
00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.071
12 December 1981 11:50 pm

24
00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:07.655
The partners were about
to meet at a historic time –


25
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.113
the introduction or martial law in Poland.

26
00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:14.363
It's the story of the first Polish fortunes.

27
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.821
And I was there to watch
how they made their millions.


28
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.030
Gentlemen,

29
00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.446
you are under arrest for fencing.

30
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.530
Fencing?

31
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.946
I can explain.

32
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.488
Did you sell this icon?

33
00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:29.405
I did.

34
00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:30.696
But it's not stolen.

35
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.738
He claimed it came from police evidence.

36
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.363
Badmouthing the state police?

37
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.238
You're under arrest.
Take him away.


38
00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.613
<i>The work of generations…</i>

39
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.238
What is this Muppet show?

40
00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.280
<i>…is being laid to ruins.</i>

41
00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.613
<i>Key areas stop functioning.</i>

42
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.863
<i>The dwindling economy…</i>

43
00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:54.280
That's what rock-stars do in the West.

44
00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:55.530
Open the window!

45
00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.238
Kazik!

46
00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:00.196
Kazik! Kazik!

47
00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:05.405
Off you go!

48
00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:12.905
This is how Kazimierz Bączek rocks!

49
00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:16.988
Kazimierz Bączek. A janitor, currency dealer
and small time crook.


50
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.613
Protected by the deal he struck
with state security.


51
00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:22.363
Do you know what you did?

52
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.280
I killed a man with a TV-set.

53
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.821
Worse.

54
00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:28.363
You killed a state security agent!

55
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.613
What's the penalty?

56
00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:33.155
Death.

57
00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:37.238
I am so sorry.

58
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.946
These things happen.

59
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:43.571
- Is there no other solution?
- Sign this.


60
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.738
And never mention any of this again.

61
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.905
I'll sign anything.

62
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.946
What's in it for me?

63
00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:58.821
Colonel Starczewski.

64
00:03:58.905 --> 00:03:59.946
A true villain.

65
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.571
Military intelligence.

66
00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:05.030
He was like the mafia,
spinning his web.


67
00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:13.280
Do you know this man?

68
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:16.363
Barely. Small-time crook.

69
00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:18.280
You are best friends now.

70
00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.530
Everything you see,

71
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.780
everything you find out…

72
00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:22.905
Know what I mean?

73
00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:27.238
I'm so sorry!

74
00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:28.446
There you are!

75
00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:29.946
I was worried sick!

76
00:04:29.988 --> 00:04:30.988
There's war!

77
00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:34.196
Curfew after 10 pm, the phones are off.

78
00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:36.030
I'm so happy they let you go.

79
00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:38.530
Nobody would to talk to me.

80
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.363
Well, you know…

81
00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.655
Through Antek, 
Bączek met Komar.

82
00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:44.530
Good day!

83
00:04:44.613 --> 00:04:45.696
A famous tennis player

84
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780
and party animal.

85
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.155
In reality he was most famous for

86
00:04:50.238 --> 00:04:52.488
running luxury escorts.

87
00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:55.738
Allow me to introduce
doctor Antoni Kafer!


88
00:04:56.821 --> 00:05:01.363
Artist and Art school faculty.

89
00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:05.863
- Maestro Antoni Kafer!
- That should fire up my ego.


90
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:08.655
And yet you're still idling.

91
00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:09.738
Better than misfiring.

92
00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:11.113
We've met.

93
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.988
It's good to see you.
I need more.


94
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.030
No problem.

95
00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:18.905
Are you Antoni's friend?

96
00:05:19.863 --> 00:05:21.321
Please, join us.

97
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.613
Friends of friends are also my friends.

98
00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:27.280
The three musketeers were soon
joined by a fourth one.


99
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.321
The son of a
general in the Polish Army.

100
00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:31.488
Karol Lis.

101
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.238
Also under colonel Starczewski's umbrella.

102
00:05:34.488 --> 00:05:37.071
Will she remain your wife after she
learns of your indiscretions?


103
00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:38.363
How do you know?

104
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.280
The wives were not stupid.

105
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:41.321
They knew.

106
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.863
They had their reasons not to leave.

107
00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:46.405
Dorota was the toughest.

108
00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:49.155
She ran a sewing business
and was doing good.


109
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:52.655
Denim was in fashion, but it
wasn't available anywhere.


110
00:05:52.863 --> 00:05:55.571
Thank you, lieutenant,

111
00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.863
for this well carried out search.

112
00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:00.821
I'll gladly report your dedication
to your superiors.


113
00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:02.696
I don't understand.

114
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.113
One word is enough.

115
00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:08.571
Talent can't go to waste
on such low level.


116
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.905
You could get promoted…

117
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.113
Krysia was Bączek's wife.

118
00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:13.988
I have work.

119
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.030
Well…

120
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.696
She just loved him too much.

121
00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:18.905
And he did what he wanted.

122
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.363
I made you some beef tartare!

123
00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:24.530
Beef tartare?
Janitors living the high life!


124
00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:26.321
Been queuing three days for the meat!

125
00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:28.530
- They sold beef, so…
- Queuing. Right…


126
00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:31.696
I always thought this was
the wrong company for Antek.


127
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.113
I was young, naive
and very much in love.

128
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:35.780
I resisted for a long time.

129
00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.155
Didn't want to be one of his flings.

130
00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.988
Love plays by its own rules.

131
00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:43.988
Nothing to do with rational thinking.

132
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:45.696
Oh…

133
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.446
Is it not too late?

134
00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:54.571
Absolutely not, professor.

135
00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:58.571
Can I come in?

136
00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:04.321
Yes, please.

137
00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:25.613
Are you painting with artificial lighting?

138
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.321
It's just a touch-up.

139
00:07:33.988 --> 00:07:35.613
I only have loose-leaf…

140
00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:37.488
I'll have some.

141
00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:17.238
Compared to the Polish transformation,
the Wild West was a sandbox.


142
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.071
Bączek was turning everything into money.

143
00:08:20.613 --> 00:08:22.655
Stolen cars, forged fuel coupons…

144
00:08:22.863 --> 00:08:23.988
This is the key.

145
00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:25.863
Tricking tourists.

146
00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:26.988
What is that?

147
00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:29.905
I wanted railway worker, not miner!

148
00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:33.405
It's my in-law's. The man
dreamed of being a railway worker!


149
00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:39.071
Lower the barrier.
They're coming.


150
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.238
How much?

151
00:08:52.405 --> 00:08:53.405
100!

152
00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:55.738
Bitte!

153
00:08:57.113 --> 00:08:58.113
Change money?

154
00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:02.738
There's the train!

155
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.946
- We need to do something!
- Leave it!


156
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.655
No, my bad! The
train will let you through.

157
00:09:16.113 --> 00:09:17.780
Crooks can smell other crooks.

158
00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:20.571
And when the lieutenant didn't get promoted,

159
00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:23.071
he stuck with Bączek's group.

160
00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:25.696
I do not only business protection.

161
00:09:26.488 --> 00:09:28.530
I became a businessman myself.

162
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:29.821
Much like you.

163
00:09:30.113 --> 00:09:31.905
I have access to wholesalers.

164
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.280
If you need something, just…

165
00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:37.196
I run everything from here.

166
00:09:37.696 --> 00:09:38.696
Room 102.

167
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.238
Good evening, Mr. Lis.

168
00:10:16.738 --> 00:10:17.738
What? Here?

169
00:10:19.113 --> 00:10:20.363
Are you crazy?

170
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:24.571
Relax. I'm not on duty.

171
00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:28.530
Sorry for bothering you.

172
00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:51.696
Bravo!

173
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:04.821
If you need anything.

174
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:09.405
Denim, threads, rivets.

175
00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:10.446
Anything.

176
00:11:11.363 --> 00:11:14.363
I run things from here. Room 102.

177
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.405
102 for denim, you say?

178
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.905
Tell him.

179
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.071
She didn't take your letter.

180
00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:23.196
Why not?

181
00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:25.363
Because she wanted to speak in person!

182
00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:32.363
How about you offer me a drink?

183
00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:34.905
Of course!

184
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.613
Vodka?

185
00:11:38.738 --> 00:11:41.363
A drink! Campari with juice.

186
00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:44.113
Can-can with juice for the lady!

187
00:11:44.613 --> 00:11:45.613
Coming up.

188
00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:48.280
How long has it been?

189
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.696
Seven years I was away.

190
00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:56.738
You're famous. 
Saw you at a festival.

191
00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:00.196
I wanted…

192
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.530
We could've had it all!

193
00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:06.071
All!

194
00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:07.738
I know.
I regret it.


195
00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:12.821
What about the child?

196
00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:15.530
I was 17! I wasn't ready!

197
00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:18.530
- Did you have an abortion?
- A miscarriage!


198
00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:24.405
Kazik…

199
00:12:25.363 --> 00:12:26.571
What if this is a sign?

200
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.530
Our second chance?

201
00:12:31.696 --> 00:12:33.363
Is there some place we can talk?

202
00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:39.030
There is.

203
00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:45.863
Bring the order to room 210
and put it on room 102.


204
00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:46.988
Certainly.

205
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.321
Good evening.

206
00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:50.821
Are you Kazimierz Bączek?

207
00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:55.488
Did you too turn to some business?

208
00:12:58.363 --> 00:12:59.571
Here's some seed money.

209
00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.780
My name is Maciejak. 
I'm with the police.

210
00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:05.696
You're coming with us.

211
00:13:06.863 --> 00:13:08.071
Where are you taking him?

212
00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:09.821
Put this back.

213
00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:13.155
Take him away.

214
00:13:13.446 --> 00:13:15.030
That was a great performance!

215
00:13:18.446 --> 00:13:20.988
For Lis and Bączek this was nothing unusual.

216
00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:22.530
They were always dirty.

217
00:13:23.738 --> 00:13:24.946
State police!

218
00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:27.821
- Let's talk about this!
- Not this time!


219
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.946
Nice. Grab them.

220
00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:35.030
I'm only here for the denim.

221
00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:36.988
Denim? What denim?

222
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.863
He came here with the bale
and is leaving with it.


223
00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:42.155
Very well.
I'm leaving.


224
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.946
You're leaving with us.

225
00:13:53.946 --> 00:13:55.738
Time in jail and orders from your handler.

226
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.488
Good base for a solid friendship.

227
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:01.446
Did you see the guy who just left?

228
00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:05.363
You'll work together.

229
00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:07.821
You'll keep an eye on him.

230
00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.196
What should I do?

231
00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:14.446
What you are. Just more actively.

232
00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:16.488
More actively.

233
00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.155
70% of every dime
you make goes to us.

234
00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:21.488
And everything will be forgotten.

235
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.780
Dorota was also very active.

236
00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:30.946
Hello?

237
00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:32.905
It's you.

238
00:14:34.113 --> 00:14:35.905
All is well. Don't worry.

239
00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:41.113
Can you call me later?
I am hiring a new seamstress.


240
00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:45.405
Do you need a lift?

241
00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.696
Yes! The bus stop is miles away!

242
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.446
We'll be grateful.

243
00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:53.238
I saw him inside. 
He's got friends.

244
00:14:53.988 --> 00:14:54.988
After you.

245
00:14:58.738 --> 00:15:00.988
Kazik felt that Karol might be useful.

246
00:15:01.613 --> 00:15:03.946
And he was right about that.

247
00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:10.238
I was gathering cards all over town.

248
00:15:10.321 --> 00:15:12.321
- Where's the money?
- Safe.


249
00:15:14.488 --> 00:15:15.488
Mind you head!

250
00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:24.196
By meeting Karol and Dorota
Kazik struck gold.


251
00:15:27.613 --> 00:15:28.613
POZNAŃ, 1987

252
00:15:29.113 --> 00:15:31.946
Back then we were doing
better than most people.


253
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.613
For Bączek this wasn't enough.

254
00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:34.696
Way to go, Komar!

255
00:15:35.613 --> 00:15:36.571
Keep it up!

256
00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:38.738
He was getting increasingly greedy.

257
00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:44.696
Dorota's idea brought him
the millions he desired.


258
00:15:48.571 --> 00:15:49.571
Kazik!

259
00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:50.905
Karol!

260
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:53.321
You didn't say you'd bring Dorota!

261
00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:54.405
Hi!

262
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:58.113
Don't you know I love tennis?

263
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.238
What's the score?

264
00:16:00.571 --> 00:16:02.071
Our champ is winning.

265
00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:07.113
Because Becker and Lendl didn't make it.

266
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:13.946
Pour us a drink!

267
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.030
Why does a tennis player
make a good barman?


268
00:16:20.071 --> 00:16:22.155
Because he can serve!

269
00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:26.530
I'll check on the juniors.

270
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.488
People spend their last dime
to buy decent vodka.


271
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:36.446
We should share the state's
monopoly on vodka and taxes.


272
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.863
- None for me.
- Like the US during the prohibition.


273
00:16:39.946 --> 00:16:41.280
I like what I hear.

274
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.863
Who needs all that tax money?

275
00:16:44.988 --> 00:16:46.155
It's all a waste!

276
00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:47.196
That's right.

277
00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:49.738
A sea of taxes!

278
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:53.280
Let's change state's money into our money.

279
00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:58.363
We can put it to better use
than those bureaucrats.


280
00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:05.363
That is a wicked idea!

281
00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:11.280
Hit him with a backhand!

282
00:17:16.155 --> 00:17:18.655
We need to flood the country with vodka.

283
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.571
400-600% profit.

284
00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:22.905
800%!

285
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.196
Like Escobar on cocaine!

286
00:17:26.238 --> 00:17:27.905
He's in the paper!

287
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:30.571
You'll be just as famous!

288
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.696
I need to pick up some wares.

289
00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:43.655
Remember who pointed you
towards big business.


290
00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:45.321
I'll always help you.

291
00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:47.405
I will never forget this.

292
00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:50.071
The devil is always in the details.

293
00:17:55.863 --> 00:17:59.821
And no more sewing for my playboy husband.

294
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.238
I'm always helping!

295
00:18:03.113 --> 00:18:04.113
Fuck off.

296
00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:07.238
Kazik!

297
00:18:08.113 --> 00:18:11.946
Substitution!
Komar for Lis!


298
00:18:12.238 --> 00:18:14.946
Heard you're looking for
someone to sell us the booze?


299
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.905
I know just the guy!

300
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:19.738
In Berlin.

301
00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:23.321
I hope he's more real than
our trip to DeNiro's private island…


302
00:18:23.446 --> 00:18:25.113
Don't bullshit a bullshitter!

303
00:18:26.113 --> 00:18:28.446
If at first you don't succeed…

304
00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:29.988
Let the others do the deed!

305
00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:34.655
And here's our friend from the coast!

306
00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:36.488
And no wife!

307
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:37.571
Gentlemen!

308
00:18:37.738 --> 00:18:40.613
I took care of the
fun part of the evening!

309
00:18:42.363 --> 00:18:43.488
Sounds interesting.

310
00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:46.405
It's time for some friendly family feud!

311
00:18:58.238 --> 00:18:59.571
Shall we dance, pretty boy?

312
00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:03.780
Maybe later, princess.

313
00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:10.530
There was a slight mix-up.

314
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.071
Is everyone happy?

315
00:19:18.238 --> 00:19:19.655
Where are you going?

316
00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:24.863
Relax, bro. Family stuff.

317
00:19:25.988 --> 00:19:26.988
I'll be back.

318
00:19:27.738 --> 00:19:28.738
Stick around.

319
00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.863
Just look at our life!

320
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:55.113
Hello, my dear!

321
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.863
I can't, I'm sorry.

322
00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.405
I met the Art School dean from Cracow.

323
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.446
The fat one. Have to talk to him.

324
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:08.071
Krystyna!

325
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.905
How big he is!

326
00:20:12.655 --> 00:20:15.155
I won't go further, 
I know what's going on.

327
00:20:16.613 --> 00:20:18.738
Can you get me some paintings?

328
00:20:20.905 --> 00:20:22.405
Hold on a second.

329
00:20:23.446 --> 00:20:24.738
- Krystyna…
- Call me Krysia.


330
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:29.446
I know about the women
and your men's business.


331
00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.530
I won't agree to a divorce.

332
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:33.071
"For better or worse."

333
00:20:33.321 --> 00:20:34.571
I swore it in church.

334
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.613
He can't mess with God's will.

335
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.530
Keep it down, please.

336
00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:40.696
I have a kid!

337
00:20:41.405 --> 00:20:42.863
I need security!

338
00:20:43.571 --> 00:20:46.113
Get me some paintings.
I know you can.


339
00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.238
I'll keep you in mind.

340
00:20:50.405 --> 00:20:52.071
Let me walk you to your cab.

341
00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:59.280
Or maybe your icons?

342
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.280
I heard you talking about value increase!

343
00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:04.113
How it's a good investment.

344
00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:06.071
Those icons…

345
00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:08.321
…are quite rare.

346
00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:09.988
I'll call around.

347
00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.738
I'll ask.

348
00:21:28.863 --> 00:21:29.863
Marzena?

349
00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:32.905
See, I got rid of the fat guy.

350
00:21:33.238 --> 00:21:34.571
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

351
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.405
Maybe we can go to the movies?

352
00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:39.571
Top Gun at 8 pm?

353
00:21:40.321 --> 00:21:41.738
I have to go to Berlin soon.

354
00:21:43.196 --> 00:21:44.196
Bye.

355
00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:09.696
What the hell?

356
00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:14.405
Get behind the wheel.

357
00:23:09.738 --> 00:23:11.696
WEST BERLIN, 1988

358
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.280
<i>Halt!</i>

359
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:17.821
CA.

360
00:23:18.113 --> 00:23:19.780
Store for rich Germans.

361
00:23:20.071 --> 00:23:21.071
Let's go.

362
00:23:21.238 --> 00:23:22.238
You bet!

363
00:23:22.738 --> 00:23:24.071
I'll be right back.

364
00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:27.446
Paradise!

365
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.571
Look! Perfect for you!

366
00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:02.238
Leave the bling.

367
00:24:03.405 --> 00:24:06.238
A Casio is good enough.
And it plays music!


368
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.655
Your suitcases!

369
00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:09.905
Excuse me!

370
00:24:11.613 --> 00:24:12.571
Guys!

371
00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:14.946
<i>Vielen Dank!</i>

372
00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:17.238
I bought western briefcases.

373
00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:18.655
<i>Danke.</i>

374
00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:21.363
To Poland? Together?

375
00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:23.363
No, thank you.

376
00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:26.405
I… come back.

377
00:24:26.488 --> 00:24:27.488
<i>Ich warte.</i>

378
00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:30.363
Warte? That's the river in Poznań!

379
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.030
<i>Warthe.</i>

380
00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:38.488
She knows our river! In Poznań!

381
00:25:12.238 --> 00:25:13.405
Hello, gentlemen!

382
00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:17.196
Let's take care of this vodka business.

383
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:19.030
It's all a piece of cake.

384
00:25:19.363 --> 00:25:22.946
My lawyers and I are in a hurry.

385
00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:25.780
We're meeting Saudi investors.

386
00:25:26.113 --> 00:25:28.780
Come on in! Don't be shy.

387
00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:30.613
Wait.

388
00:25:31.946 --> 00:25:33.821
Nice to see you, Kazik.

389
00:25:34.488 --> 00:25:35.655
Hallo, Karol!

390
00:25:36.988 --> 00:25:38.655
<i>Wieviel wollen sie kaufen?</i>

391
00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:40.738
Kazik…

392
00:25:41.696 --> 00:25:42.738
Open the vault!

393
00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:51.946
Dough.

394
00:25:53.196 --> 00:25:54.196
Money.

395
00:26:01.405 --> 00:26:02.613
<i>Meine Herren,</i>

396
00:26:03.488 --> 00:26:06.071
We could call this a…

397
00:26:07.488 --> 00:26:09.405
…misunderstanding.

398
00:26:11.071 --> 00:26:12.363
I wish you

399
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.155
a pleasant day.

400
00:26:22.655 --> 00:26:24.280
To Poland? Together?

401
00:26:24.613 --> 00:26:25.738
Where did he go?

402
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:26.863
To think?

403
00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:30.738
No! He's selling us the vodka
with delayed payment!


404
00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:32.405
Bullshit. He told us to get out.

405
00:26:35.363 --> 00:26:37.905
Our 20.000 German marks are nothing to him.

406
00:26:41.988 --> 00:26:42.988
Pack it up and let's go.

407
00:26:43.071 --> 00:26:44.113
I come back.

408
00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:56.446
I don't believe it!

409
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.280
Parking this junk right here?

410
00:26:59.363 --> 00:27:00.280
Get in.

411
00:27:00.363 --> 00:27:01.696
What are you doing?

412
00:27:01.946 --> 00:27:02.946
Are you crazy?

413
00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:04.113
Bloody SS!

414
00:27:04.238 --> 00:27:05.905
He's a very important man!

415
00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:06.946
Stop him!

416
00:27:06.988 --> 00:27:08.405
He knows Schwarzenegger!

417
00:27:08.446 --> 00:27:10.155
He sails with Navratilova!

418
00:27:11.613 --> 00:27:12.988
What are you doing?

419
00:27:17.488 --> 00:27:18.696
Give me a chance!

420
00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:21.613
I'll get you as much as you want!

421
00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:23.946
<i>Verstanden?</i>

422
00:27:24.946 --> 00:27:25.946
Tell him!

423
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.655
Don't you have distilleries in Poland?

424
00:27:41.321 --> 00:27:44.655
He asks about Polish distilleries.

425
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.071
Why buy here?

426
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.446
Let's make a different deal.

427
00:27:51.488 --> 00:27:53.488
Bring me your spirit.

428
00:27:53.988 --> 00:27:55.321
Spirit? Alcohol?

429
00:27:55.863 --> 00:27:57.071
Poland, Russia...

430
00:27:57.405 --> 00:27:58.405
Tank trucks!

431
00:27:58.988 --> 00:27:59.988
Tank trucks.

432
00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:03.405
I'll fill it in bottles

433
00:28:03.446 --> 00:28:05.113
and sell it back to you.

434
00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:07.363
No questions asked, no customs, no taxes.

435
00:28:08.113 --> 00:28:09.113
Nothing.

436
00:28:09.196 --> 00:28:11.905
Why share profits with the state?

437
00:28:12.738 --> 00:28:15.155
He wants you to bring him pure spirit.

438
00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:16.696
He'll bottle it.

439
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.280
No taxes, no customs.

440
00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:24.280
And you can sell it cheaper than vodka.

441
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:26.321
<i>Gut?</i>

442
00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:28.571
Is that possible?

443
00:28:30.988 --> 00:28:34.238
New laws will be passed soon.
You have to hurry.


444
00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.946
It won't last forever.

445
00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:40.113
Everything is possible.

446
00:28:49.238 --> 00:28:50.696
My friend!

447
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.530
My friends!

448
00:28:55.988 --> 00:28:56.988
I come back!

449
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.780
Thank you!

450
00:29:42.988 --> 00:29:44.571
The army is brilliant.

451
00:29:45.946 --> 00:29:49.280
A base in every town.
Like McDonald's in the West.


452
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.196
Our branches!

453
00:29:53.696 --> 00:29:55.613
This gives us contacts all over the country.

454
00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:59.780
Just need some spirit
to send to Germany.


455
00:29:59.821 --> 00:30:04.363
The army can help us
move the bottled spirit


456
00:30:05.613 --> 00:30:09.280
to wholesalers all over Poland.

457
00:30:11.405 --> 00:30:12.738
That's the deal.

458
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:22.280
See you tomorrow!

459
00:30:34.613 --> 00:30:36.446
I'm Maciejak, with the Polish police.

460
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.696
How's the weather in Berlin?

461
00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.238
So that's the deal.

462
00:30:42.696 --> 00:30:44.863
Want us to work on collective farms?

463
00:30:45.196 --> 00:30:47.530
Report each time we take a leak?

464
00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:54.363
Harassing people who want freedom of trade!

465
00:30:54.655 --> 00:30:57.238
Meaningless malcontents!

466
00:30:57.488 --> 00:31:00.030
I'm not here to harass you!

467
00:31:01.113 --> 00:31:02.155
I want to help!

468
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.405
You and Marzena.

469
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:06.280
How could you help me?

470
00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:20.988
We can talk nicely

471
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280
or not.

472
00:31:22.363 --> 00:31:24.905
Someone less nice could beat you up.

473
00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.321
What do you want?

474
00:31:36.613 --> 00:31:37.613
Lis.

475
00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:39.696
And Bączek.

476
00:31:41.446 --> 00:31:46.030
It's not you who runs your

477
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:47.821
small time cartel.

478
00:31:50.946 --> 00:31:52.030
Hello, darling!

479
00:31:52.405 --> 00:31:53.405
Hi!

480
00:31:53.863 --> 00:31:55.321
Everything all right?

481
00:31:56.155 --> 00:31:57.155
Just talking.

482
00:31:57.696 --> 00:32:00.405
I was leaving.

483
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.071
You should also think about it!

484
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.863
Do you want to live like this?

485
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:14.113
Drive in old Fiats to Berlin
with new Mercs parked here?


486
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:17.738
Can't we show some patriotic spirit?

487
00:32:18.155 --> 00:32:19.738
We all know it's a lie!

488
00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.446
The Merc is stolen!

489
00:32:21.488 --> 00:32:24.696
As soon as it crosses the border
you get in trouble.


490
00:32:24.988 --> 00:32:28.905
We don't cooperate with agencies
in the West. Yet!


491
00:32:30.655 --> 00:32:31.863
This will change.

492
00:32:33.488 --> 00:32:35.155
You still have a chance!

493
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:37.821
Right. Come on!

494
00:32:40.613 --> 00:32:42.613
I'm not naive!

495
00:32:42.696 --> 00:32:45.446
I know it's not easy doing business here.

496
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.863
It's getting to dangerous.

497
00:32:47.405 --> 00:32:49.113
It's time to step away.

498
00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.196
If this deal works out,
we'll talk about this.


499
00:32:53.238 --> 00:32:54.405
Okay?
Come on.


500
00:32:58.321 --> 00:32:59.321
Don't be mad.

501
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:07.530
You said you had a present?

502
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.655
Right, where is my mind.

503
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280
Ready?

504
00:33:20.488 --> 00:33:21.488
Jesus!

505
00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:23.696
Is it real?

506
00:33:23.738 --> 00:33:25.571
Straight from Berlin!
A Big Mac!


507
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.696
I'm sorry it's cold.

508
00:33:33.488 --> 00:33:34.488
Jesus!

509
00:33:36.196 --> 00:33:37.446
It smells so good!

510
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.530
Told you!

511
00:33:40.363 --> 00:33:41.363
Thank you!

512
00:33:44.863 --> 00:33:46.030
Want to split it?

513
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:47.280
No, I've had one.

514
00:33:49.405 --> 00:33:50.405
I have more!

515
00:33:50.655 --> 00:33:52.530
- It's so good!
- You like it?


516
00:34:15.238 --> 00:34:16.238
Hey! Romeo!

517
00:34:17.821 --> 00:34:20.280
Where's this Army
-McDonald's?

518
00:34:23.155 --> 00:34:25.655
- Anybody coming?
- Coming.


519
00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:34.488
That's alcohol!

520
00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:37.071
Vodka down the drain!

521
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:41.238
That's communist negligence.

522
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:46.280
In the US you'd get fired for this.

523
00:35:02.363 --> 00:35:05.363
Guys, this is colonel Zabieło.

524
00:35:05.738 --> 00:35:08.280
The commander of the local army base.

525
00:35:09.238 --> 00:35:10.613
You have to be the husband.

526
00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:11.946
The lieutenant.

527
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.405
I am lieutenant Lis. 
Cunning as a fox.

528
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.071
We'll see about that.

529
00:35:20.655 --> 00:35:22.363
And here's the plant manager.

530
00:35:22.738 --> 00:35:24.030
No deal!

531
00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:26.738
You can send them home.

532
00:35:27.113 --> 00:35:28.113
What's wrong?

533
00:35:28.155 --> 00:35:29.446
They have a buyer!

534
00:35:30.071 --> 00:35:32.488
- I won't sell.
- Why not?


535
00:35:33.363 --> 00:35:34.363
Do something!

536
00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:37.446
Unless you have… dollars.

537
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.530
I will take dollars.

538
00:35:39.696 --> 00:35:41.821
Why only dollars?

539
00:35:43.071 --> 00:35:45.321
Because I need a new line!

540
00:35:45.655 --> 00:35:46.655
And gaskets!

541
00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:48.530
The old line is falling apart.

542
00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:52.905
And since the army is in charge
I can't get any gaskets!


543
00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:54.113
You are forgetting yourself!

544
00:35:54.196 --> 00:35:56.030
Stop talking!

545
00:35:56.113 --> 00:35:57.738
With the old government
we had everything!


546
00:35:57.821 --> 00:36:00.071
Now with the army in charge?

547
00:36:00.155 --> 00:36:01.280
There's nothing!

548
00:36:02.405 --> 00:36:03.655
Without the gaskets

549
00:36:03.946 --> 00:36:05.530
I'll have to listen

550
00:36:05.988 --> 00:36:08.571
about communist negligence!

551
00:36:08.946 --> 00:36:10.363
I am a good manager!

552
00:36:11.738 --> 00:36:12.738
Listen,

553
00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:17.155
I like you.

554
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.946
I can do business with you.

555
00:36:20.363 --> 00:36:21.363
We'll get you dollars.

556
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.780
Everything.

557
00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:26.946
Our customer provided 2 million dollars.

558
00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:29.446
He's a big player.

559
00:36:32.071 --> 00:36:34.280
Excuse us for a second!

560
00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:37.905
We don't have that kind of money!

561
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:39.738
The dollars?

562
00:36:40.905 --> 00:36:42.488
How can you get it?

563
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.321
One has to steal the first million!

564
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.030
Gentlemen,

565
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.988
is there a phone I could use?

566
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.655
Certainly. This way.

567
00:37:09.238 --> 00:37:10.530
Hello, Mr. Bączek!

568
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.863
70:30 for you.

569
00:37:15.446 --> 00:37:16.488
It's all there.

570
00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:41.488
Are we good?

571
00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:45.238
I'd like my briefcase back.

572
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.655
From last month.

573
00:37:47.113 --> 00:37:48.530
They're not cheap.

574
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.071
More people are coming?

575
00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:02.446
Indeed.

576
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:03.821
But individually.

577
00:38:04.196 --> 00:38:05.196
Beef tartare?

578
00:38:05.363 --> 00:38:07.155
Two eggs, the way you like it.

579
00:38:08.988 --> 00:38:09.988
Some bread,

580
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.321
Mr. Bączek?

581
00:38:16.613 --> 00:38:18.655
I need dollars.

582
00:38:19.946 --> 00:38:21.696
For the spirit for the German.

583
00:38:22.655 --> 00:38:23.988
Business of a lifetime.

584
00:38:24.613 --> 00:38:26.113
You deal in currency.

585
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.113
So you're not going to help?

586
00:38:30.155 --> 00:38:31.280
Piece of advice.

587
00:38:32.488 --> 00:38:34.196
Big money stinks.

588
00:38:34.363 --> 00:38:37.321
That's why we'll after it
like flies after shit.


589
00:38:38.238 --> 00:38:41.446
But wise men know
that shit needs some perfume.


590
00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:45.488
Some dessert?

591
00:38:47.738 --> 00:38:48.738
Apple pie.

592
00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:49.863
Or no…

593
00:38:50.613 --> 00:38:52.196
I want a whole cake!

594
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.280
Chocolate?

595
00:38:56.155 --> 00:38:57.655
It's good. Swiss.

596
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.155
Shokotella.

597
00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.238
All children like chocolate.

598
00:39:03.113 --> 00:39:04.363
And everyone likes

599
00:39:04.613 --> 00:39:05.613
children.

600
00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:06.655
So…

601
00:39:06.988 --> 00:39:07.988
So what?

602
00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:13.655
So we'll contact you with
the Shokotella guy.


603
00:39:14.155 --> 00:39:16.488
You'll be the representative for Poland.

604
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.238
You won't make money,

605
00:39:18.613 --> 00:39:21.613
but it'll turn you into
legitimate businesspeople,


606
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.655
putting a smile on kids' faces.

607
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:28.405
But how will I pay for the spirit?

608
00:39:32.446 --> 00:39:34.280
See Wacław Trojan.

609
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.196
- Banker.
- And diplomat.


610
00:39:36.446 --> 00:39:38.280
Just came back from Luxembourg.

611
00:39:39.196 --> 00:39:41.446
Wants to get our financial market going.

612
00:39:43.113 --> 00:39:46.571
So he'll buy the chocolate
and get us the currency?


613
00:39:46.655 --> 00:39:47.655
No.

614
00:39:49.321 --> 00:39:51.196
You eat the chocolate.

615
00:39:53.946 --> 00:39:55.613
Tell Trojan everything.

616
00:39:56.988 --> 00:39:58.571
Mr. Bączek is leaving.

617
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.530
Grab a business-card.

618
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:09.071
BANKER
Wacław Trojan


619
00:40:27.196 --> 00:40:30.946
Honorary Consulate
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg


620
00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.488
Nobody noticed that the diplomat
was military intelligence.


621
00:41:00.613 --> 00:41:02.780
Everything was set up.

622
00:41:02.863 --> 00:41:06.696
He was the same guy
they spoke to in Berlin.


623
00:41:09.696 --> 00:41:11.155
And ready.

624
00:41:11.613 --> 00:41:14.113
Tea in seconds.

625
00:41:15.905 --> 00:41:16.905
That's magic.

626
00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:19.821
I need to touch it.

627
00:41:24.738 --> 00:41:26.655
What's it called again? Micro…

628
00:41:27.405 --> 00:41:28.405
Micro-well?

629
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:30.696
Micro
-WAVE.

630
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.113
Wait until you see
the trick with a credit card.


631
00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:39.030
You put it in a microwave and boom!

632
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.946
What's in this card?

633
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.655
Piece of plastic.

634
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.155
You put it in a wall
and money comes out.


635
00:41:49.905 --> 00:41:52.071
Where can I get this plastic?

636
00:41:52.363 --> 00:41:53.571
Only in the West.

637
00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.863
The West has to be…

638
00:41:57.155 --> 00:41:58.196
paradise.

639
00:41:59.238 --> 00:42:00.780
I want to go to the West!

640
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.530
Ladies,

641
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.905
how about you go for a smoke?

642
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:10.071
We'll discuss our visit
with the Sultan of Brunei,


643
00:42:10.446 --> 00:42:13.071
the wealthiest man alive.

644
00:42:27.446 --> 00:42:28.988
So how much do you need?

645
00:42:31.696 --> 00:42:32.696
Two…

646
00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:35.196
Don't inhale.

647
00:42:36.446 --> 00:42:38.155
Two? Did I hear right?

648
00:42:40.738 --> 00:42:42.238
- Two.
- Two what?


649
00:42:44.155 --> 00:42:45.155
Two million.

650
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:16.530
They say one has
to steal the first million.

651
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:19.321
Told you!

652
00:43:20.363 --> 00:43:21.363
Given…

653
00:43:21.863 --> 00:43:24.613
…we steal the first million,

654
00:43:24.946 --> 00:43:26.821
we'd still be one million short.

655
00:43:27.446 --> 00:43:29.030
Doesn't solve anything.

656
00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:30.571
And that is why

657
00:43:31.696 --> 00:43:33.696
you won't steal anything.

658
00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:36.363
Just cut it out. 
From newspapers.

659
00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.405
Cut it out?

660
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.780
What newspapers?

661
00:43:38.863 --> 00:43:40.113
Any paper will do.

662
00:43:40.196 --> 00:43:41.196
Got a light?

663
00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:46.280
- Are you crazy? So much money?
- Easy!


664
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:48.821
It's not your two dollars.

665
00:43:57.321 --> 00:44:00.655
Once you have more money,
you'll see it's just paper.


666
00:44:01.155 --> 00:44:02.363
Just paper.

667
00:44:11.488 --> 00:44:12.655
Grab some newspapers.

668
00:44:13.863 --> 00:44:15.155
And start cutting.

669
00:44:15.738 --> 00:44:17.238
I'll handle the rest.

670
00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:19.280
And the tennis pro will come in handy.

671
00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:22.488
Always glad to help.

672
00:44:22.655 --> 00:44:24.238
To keep up appearances.

673
00:44:24.321 --> 00:44:26.863
I'll contact you with a cooperative bank.

674
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.863
You need to own

675
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.155
a state company.

676
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280
Be quiet.

677
00:44:46.613 --> 00:44:47.571
Is something wrong?

678
00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:50.113
Just looking for a place to smoke.

679
00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:51.738
Do you have a light?

680
00:44:57.655 --> 00:44:58.655
Thank you.

681
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.530
Thanks.

682
00:45:07.655 --> 00:45:08.946
Are you a snitch?

683
00:45:09.405 --> 00:45:11.363
- What?
- Who do you work for?


684
00:45:11.655 --> 00:45:13.738
- It's not like that.
- You have a minute to explain.


685
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.988
I worry about Antoni.

686
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.988
That he ends up shit creek.

687
00:45:21.696 --> 00:45:24.488
Who the hell is this consul?
Damn porno fan.


688
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.905
Thinks we're stupid
and he can keep us in the kitchen.


689
00:45:28.821 --> 00:45:30.238
Give me that lighter.

690
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.988
You might be right.

691
00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:36.155
But what can we do?

692
00:45:43.238 --> 00:45:44.946
Maybe we should join forces?

693
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:16.780
Polish Socialist Youth Union

694
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:23.780
That is great!

695
00:46:24.113 --> 00:46:25.238
Got something else?

696
00:46:25.363 --> 00:46:26.363
Sure!

697
00:46:26.446 --> 00:46:29.905
There's a flight simulator.
Brilliant.


698
00:46:29.988 --> 00:46:31.530
And strategy games.

699
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.446
My… Our boy plays them for hours!

700
00:46:36.655 --> 00:46:37.655
And I'm dead.

701
00:46:39.821 --> 00:46:40.821
Wanna try?

702
00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:45.238
If only you were
so brilliant in other areas…

703
00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:48.738
Chanel No.5

704
00:46:49.405 --> 00:46:50.571
Only available for dollars.

705
00:46:51.655 --> 00:46:53.946
Interesting thing that Commodore.

706
00:46:54.113 --> 00:46:55.113
Commodore

707
00:46:55.488 --> 00:46:56.696
with a K.

708
00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.113
Can we talk about that chocolate?

709
00:47:01.821 --> 00:47:02.821
Short story.

710
00:47:07.113 --> 00:47:10.280
You become chairman of the board,
nominated by the Youth Union.


711
00:47:10.655 --> 00:47:13.738
The Union becomes majority shareholder.

712
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:17.238
While in reality the company is yours.

713
00:47:17.363 --> 00:47:18.363
Ours.

714
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:20.030
Ours and the Union's.

715
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.071
He's the

716
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.780
CEO and shareholder.

717
00:47:27.113 --> 00:47:28.613
Soldier. Servant of the state.

718
00:47:28.905 --> 00:47:31.363
Son of a general from
the Military Council!


719
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.196
Of National Salvation!

720
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.280
And you!

721
00:47:34.863 --> 00:47:37.780
On paper.
For the optics.


722
00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:40.321
People trust the army.

723
00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:45.280
What would I have to do?

724
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:47.780
On the supervisory board?

725
00:47:48.196 --> 00:47:49.446
Just be present.

726
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.613
As a young politician

727
00:47:51.988 --> 00:47:53.696
you should not ask "what".

728
00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:54.988
Ask "how much".

729
00:47:58.863 --> 00:47:59.863
Right.

730
00:48:00.988 --> 00:48:01.988
How much?

731
00:48:02.238 --> 00:48:03.238
100.

732
00:48:03.405 --> 00:48:04.405
100?

733
00:48:07.363 --> 00:48:10.530
I like a good negotiator.

734
00:48:11.988 --> 00:48:13.780
150$ a month.

735
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.946
Shall we start printing and visit the notary?

736
00:48:29.655 --> 00:48:32.655
What's the name of the company?

737
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.780
Maybe something patriotic?

738
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.280
Posnania?

739
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.905
What about that?

740
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.363
Posnania Import Export.

741
00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:46.488
Short
PIE!


742
00:48:47.446 --> 00:48:48.446
Pie!

743
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.488
Goes well with chocolate.

744
00:48:54.988 --> 00:48:57.071
You forgot the Commandore.

745
00:48:57.905 --> 00:49:00.613
It's a present.
Play with your kids.


746
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.696
With the TV-set it goes for 500$.

747
00:49:05.238 --> 00:49:06.905
Welcome to hard currency paradise.

748
00:49:11.655 --> 00:49:12.655
Think fast!

749
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.530
Good enough for Stockholm.

750
00:50:01.988 --> 00:50:03.655
Mr. Komar! It's an honor!

751
00:50:04.321 --> 00:50:05.613
Welcome to our humble abode.

752
00:50:05.655 --> 00:50:06.988
Hallo!

753
00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:11.488
I didn't know the consul
knew such famous people!


754
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.780
Thank you.

755
00:50:12.905 --> 00:50:15.571
I can't remember where I met him.

756
00:50:16.071 --> 00:50:17.905
Must've been at Roman Polanski's.

757
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.488
In his Alpine hut.

758
00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:22.071
Wouldn't mind owning one myself.

759
00:50:23.155 --> 00:50:25.571
Beautiful banks you have in Poland.

760
00:50:26.571 --> 00:50:27.780
Call me Filip.

761
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:30.571
I have a present for you.

762
00:50:31.571 --> 00:50:33.821
I hear your son is interested in sports?

763
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:36.821
I have a daughter.

764
00:50:37.155 --> 00:50:38.238
Two, actually.

765
00:50:38.321 --> 00:50:42.030
Great! Maybe one of them
will be a new Navratilova!


766
00:50:42.238 --> 00:50:44.113
Just better looking.

767
00:50:44.613 --> 00:50:48.696
I used this in the semi-final
in Stockholm.


768
00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:50.821
Must've been a tough match.

769
00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:54.238
Looks as if someone
hit it on the pavement.

770
00:50:55.488 --> 00:50:57.696
You know how it is.
It's not easy.


771
00:50:58.905 --> 00:51:00.030
Before I forget.

772
00:51:00.488 --> 00:51:01.988
One small matter.

773
00:51:02.238 --> 00:51:05.030
- I have friends who sell chocolate.
- Sweet.


774
00:51:05.113 --> 00:51:08.030
It's a Socialist Youth company,
so it's political.


775
00:51:08.238 --> 00:51:09.238
Posnania.

776
00:51:09.613 --> 00:51:13.071
They put a smile on kids' faces.

777
00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:17.488
If you could help them out…

778
00:51:17.863 --> 00:51:19.905
You're not trying to bribe me?

779
00:51:21.446 --> 00:51:23.321
I would never…

780
00:51:27.655 --> 00:51:28.655
Kidding!

781
00:51:29.363 --> 00:51:31.988
For you? Anything!

782
00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:33.155
Great!

783
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.280
There will be some gentlemen here tomorrow.

784
00:51:37.446 --> 00:51:39.696
- What was the name?
- Posnania.


785
00:51:40.488 --> 00:51:42.696
- Follow me.
- Thank you.


786
00:51:44.613 --> 00:51:45.696
Funny guy.

787
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280
Here you go.

788
00:51:52.905 --> 00:51:54.780
Stop slacking off!
Start cutting!


789
00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:57.405
It stands here…

790
00:51:57.905 --> 00:51:59.696
It says.

791
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.571
About our Polish river.

792
00:52:04.363 --> 00:52:07.988
It stands here that Warta is overflowing.

793
00:52:08.488 --> 00:52:09.488
It says!

794
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.780
All right, gentlemen.

795
00:52:19.196 --> 00:52:21.905
Let's open the bags and start counting.

796
00:52:22.863 --> 00:52:26.488
There are Mr. Komar's friends.
The tennis pro's!


797
00:52:26.988 --> 00:52:28.655
Rules are rules.

798
00:52:30.155 --> 00:52:33.071
For all I know it could be
cut up papers.


799
00:52:33.155 --> 00:52:34.488
You must be joking!

800
00:52:34.738 --> 00:52:35.738
Some trust, maybe?

801
00:52:35.905 --> 00:52:38.655
Trust, but verify!

802
00:52:39.405 --> 00:52:41.113
Do you know who said that?

803
00:52:41.196 --> 00:52:42.196
I do.

804
00:52:42.363 --> 00:52:43.363
Lenin.

805
00:52:44.696 --> 00:52:47.780
Just leave it.
You don't want our money?


806
00:52:47.863 --> 00:52:49.530
Let's go somewhere else.

807
00:52:50.196 --> 00:52:53.238
That won't be necessary.

808
00:52:53.446 --> 00:52:55.113
Thank you for your vigilance.

809
00:52:55.363 --> 00:52:57.988
Let me handle this personally.

810
00:52:58.155 --> 00:53:00.488
A famous client, a respected company,

811
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.905
entrepreneurship spirit

812
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:04.821
of the Polish Socialist Youth Union!

813
00:53:04.863 --> 00:53:07.280
Gentlemen! To the right, please.

814
00:53:07.863 --> 00:53:09.280
Don't be shy.

815
00:53:09.905 --> 00:53:12.946
It's a political matter
of international reach.


816
00:53:15.196 --> 00:53:18.280
If you vouch for them,

817
00:53:18.988 --> 00:53:21.030
then so be it.

818
00:53:22.238 --> 00:53:25.196
Let's assume it's twenty billion złoty.

819
00:53:25.405 --> 00:53:29.613
Here's a deposit confirmation.

820
00:53:29.696 --> 00:53:35.030
This will allow you
to buy 2 million dollars.

821
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:40.280
You have a month
to turn your chocolate over.

822
00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.321
If I don't have the money back by then,
I will have to look into those bags.


823
00:53:46.405 --> 00:53:48.988
I hope all is clear.

824
00:53:49.988 --> 00:53:51.571
Yes, sir.

825
00:53:51.655 --> 00:53:53.905
We will switch the bags before then.

826
00:53:53.988 --> 00:53:55.238
Great!

827
00:53:57.571 --> 00:53:58.571
Very well.

828
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:20.946
Can you tell me,

829
00:54:21.363 --> 00:54:23.321
why the Germans need so much spirit?

830
00:54:23.405 --> 00:54:24.530
The hell I know!

831
00:54:26.446 --> 00:54:27.738
Disinfecting hospitals?

832
00:54:28.988 --> 00:54:29.988
But this much?

833
00:54:30.321 --> 00:54:31.988
Germans like it clean.

834
00:55:08.321 --> 00:55:09.571
OUTSKIRTS OF WEST BERLIN

835
00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:13.280
Time for the baptism of fire.

836
00:55:13.738 --> 00:55:16.363
That is new in the People's Republic!

837
00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:17.988
I hope they let us in.

838
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:19.946
Remember what to say?

839
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.030
According to the Ministry

840
00:55:25.238 --> 00:55:27.030
of Foreign Trade,

841
00:55:27.155 --> 00:55:29.530
I can't remember.
Do I have to say it?


842
00:55:30.363 --> 00:55:33.446
Remember! Business is a show!

843
00:55:34.405 --> 00:55:38.071
You can't stand the pressure?
You're out!


844
00:55:39.196 --> 00:55:40.571
Keep calm.

845
00:55:42.738 --> 00:55:45.196
What if they ask me
what the vodka is for?

846
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.863
Say we're selling it through Posnania.

847
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.780
Just don't mention my husband, the chairman,

848
00:55:50.863 --> 00:55:53.155
and your husband, the vice-chairman.

849
00:55:53.946 --> 00:55:54.946
Guys!

850
00:55:55.613 --> 00:55:56.613
It's finished?

851
00:55:56.738 --> 00:55:57.738
That's all?

852
00:55:57.905 --> 00:55:58.905
Let's go!

853
00:55:59.321 --> 00:56:00.696
Close the door please.

854
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:03.780
Faster!

855
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:07.863
And go!

856
00:56:18.071 --> 00:56:19.071
Oh my gosh.

857
00:56:20.446 --> 00:56:22.488
Fingers crossed!

858
00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:29.113
Do I have to explain this racket
to the customs guys?


859
00:56:30.363 --> 00:56:32.155
It's not a racket!

860
00:56:32.696 --> 00:56:36.613
And the whole transport is in your name.

861
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:40.655
So you have to put it through customs.

862
00:56:44.405 --> 00:56:45.405
Go!

863
00:56:53.238 --> 00:56:54.238
Good evening.

864
00:56:56.155 --> 00:56:57.155
Trunk please.

865
00:56:59.988 --> 00:57:02.071
Look. I have

866
00:57:02.405 --> 00:57:04.655
trousers for my husband,

867
00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.863
an electric piano for my son

868
00:57:07.488 --> 00:57:10.655
and three trucks.

869
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:15.530
And what is inside said trucks?

870
00:57:16.863 --> 00:57:17.863
Vodka.

871
00:57:18.488 --> 00:57:20.155
Spirit.
Very good.


872
00:57:20.363 --> 00:57:21.738
Even Reagan likes it!

873
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.446
Do you have a concession?

874
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:24.530
Concession?

875
00:57:25.738 --> 00:57:27.405
The trade foreign minister

876
00:57:27.905 --> 00:57:31.405
will bring the alcohol in December.

877
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:34.071
Do you understand any of this?
Crazy woman.


878
00:57:34.988 --> 00:57:37.863
What am I supposed to do
with all the vodka?


879
00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:39.155
Dear madam,

880
00:57:39.655 --> 00:57:42.905
this vodka will not enter the
People's Republic of Poland.


881
00:57:43.738 --> 00:57:45.196
It's not a booze den!

882
00:57:45.655 --> 00:57:46.946
You're in trouble.

883
00:57:48.696 --> 00:57:54.446
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade,

884
00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:58.530
the import of alcohol not for sale

885
00:57:58.613 --> 00:58:02.030
is as of today excluded from concessioning.

886
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:07.071
Entering Poland with alcohol
for private use


887
00:58:07.488 --> 00:58:11.238
requires merely a bill of sale,
which I have here.


888
00:58:17.196 --> 00:58:18.821
Do you know about this?

889
00:58:21.655 --> 00:58:23.196
I need to call Warsaw.

890
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.988
Everything seems in order.

891
00:58:52.988 --> 00:58:53.988
You can go.

892
00:58:55.071 --> 00:58:56.530
Good-bye!

893
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:15.280
Now that was something!

894
00:59:16.155 --> 00:59:18.196
The devil himself
couldn't have pulled it off.


895
00:59:18.238 --> 00:59:19.655
But two women could!

896
00:59:20.821 --> 00:59:22.363
They will make movies about us!

897
00:59:22.571 --> 00:59:23.571
You'll see.

898
01:00:03.446 --> 01:00:04.446
Hello again!

899
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.571
Hello!

900
01:00:05.655 --> 01:00:08.113
Personal use, is it?
How much do you have?


901
01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:09.238
This time it's

902
01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:11.738
154.

903
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.655
Almost had me fooled.

904
01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.988
You're something!

905
01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.488
I thought she was crazy,

906
01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:28.696
but she really had 154 trucks
filled with booze.


907
01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:31.488
For personal use.

908
01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:33.738
I'd like to see her liver.

909
01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:50.613
Guten Tag!

910
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.155
How can we help?

911
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:53.655
Rolex watches.

912
01:00:54.113 --> 01:00:55.113
Daytona.

913
01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:00.321
Rolex.

914
01:01:01.863 --> 01:01:02.863
I'm Kazik.

915
01:01:03.405 --> 01:01:04.738
The watch is Rolex.

916
01:01:18.905 --> 01:01:20.280
35.000 German marks.

917
01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:23.780
How much is that?

918
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.363
20.000.

919
01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:28.613
That's dollars.
How much in złoty?


920
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280
200 million.

921
01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:37.655
We'll take three.

922
01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:41.446
Ask whether we get a discount.

923
01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:50.321
Do we get a
discount if we buy three?

924
01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:52.905
Certainly.

925
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.780
Ask for something for a daughter.

926
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.946
You don't have a daughter!

927
01:02:33.155 --> 01:02:34.488
Nothing for the wife?

928
01:02:36.655 --> 01:02:38.071
Remember this.

929
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.571
A wife gets her kids in the summer

930
01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:42.321
and slip-ons in winter.

931
01:02:42.363 --> 01:02:43.696
Not golden watches.

932
01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:47.488
I'll take that.

933
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.780
This one, please.

934
01:02:50.488 --> 01:02:51.488
<i>Und!</i>

935
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:57.071
I rented those safe deposit boxes.

936
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.655
How much do we have?

937
01:03:01.738 --> 01:03:02.738
Millions!

938
01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:07.071
But you were wrong with your 400% margin.

939
01:03:07.655 --> 01:03:09.155
But we're doing good?

940
01:03:10.446 --> 01:03:11.905
It's 800%!

941
01:03:13.363 --> 01:03:15.071
We're making more than Escobar!

942
01:03:15.655 --> 01:03:17.946
While he is being chased
by all the police in the world,


943
01:03:18.071 --> 01:03:19.863
we have just one stubborn cop.

944
01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:22.363
And round it goes!

945
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.446
They told me I could get trousers here?

946
01:04:16.655 --> 01:04:20.696
Used to. We are changing businesses.

947
01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:23.071
To what?

948
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:26.321
Best spirit… I mean chocolate!

949
01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:28.946
Chocolate, you say?

950
01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:30.571
Here.

951
01:04:33.988 --> 01:04:35.238
What is going on here?

952
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.321
The man wanted to buy trousers
and I explained the situation.


953
01:04:39.071 --> 01:04:40.446
I was just leaving.

954
01:04:41.988 --> 01:04:42.988
Good-bye.

955
01:04:50.196 --> 01:04:52.155
Police training sucks these days.

956
01:04:53.321 --> 01:04:54.363
Was that a cop?

957
01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:56.946
Surplus jacket?

958
01:04:57.738 --> 01:04:59.446
Pretends to be cool,
spiteful eyes?


959
01:04:59.488 --> 01:05:00.905
Everybody would notice!

960
01:05:00.946 --> 01:05:02.613
And we never had walk-ins!

961
01:05:02.655 --> 01:05:04.113
Plainclothes cop.

962
01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.780
Damn.

963
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.238
Five more minutes?

964
01:05:26.946 --> 01:05:28.488
Sabina…

965
01:05:33.446 --> 01:05:35.488
Feels like old times.

966
01:05:37.405 --> 01:05:39.113
I'd like to go back in time.

967
01:05:41.613 --> 01:05:45.155
Our child – would it
be a girl or a son?

968
01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:47.446
Don't know.

969
01:05:47.905 --> 01:05:49.363
I was in shock. Didn't ask.

970
01:05:52.488 --> 01:05:54.613
It was nice, but your Kaz has to

971
01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:57.405
go back to big business.

972
01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:00.530
Time to swallow some tiny fish.

973
01:06:03.946 --> 01:06:05.196
Go get them, shark!

974
01:06:05.238 --> 01:06:06.780
Or they will swallow you!

975
01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:24.488
For some shopping.

976
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280
Do you have some left?

977
01:06:29.446 --> 01:06:30.446
Stupid!

978
01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:34.321
Bye!

979
01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:14.863
Kaz? Did you forget something?

980
01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:23.738
It's you.

981
01:07:24.946 --> 01:07:26.613
Brought you some presents.

982
01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:37.280
You really are stupid.

983
01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.030
Think I can't afford coffee?

984
01:07:40.113 --> 01:07:41.321
Never refuse presents.

985
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.530
Never.

986
01:07:47.738 --> 01:07:49.238
You know what I want.

987
01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:51.321
And you know what I want.

988
01:07:51.905 --> 01:07:54.280
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?


989
01:07:57.488 --> 01:07:58.488
Address!

990
01:08:06.321 --> 01:08:07.321
Your report.

991
01:08:23.155 --> 01:08:24.363
What a naughty boy!

992
01:08:25.946 --> 01:08:27.780
Hiding his income.

993
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:32.280
Did you find out anything about Marzena?

994
01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:34.946
I'm working on it.

995
01:08:34.988 --> 01:08:36.488
She's starting to trust me.

996
01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:40.405
Keep working.
You might even get a medal.


997
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:47.030
Her address.

998
01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:53.946
You have to make do with pictures.

999
01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:07.488
You should not have given her up.

1000
01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.530
I just want to see her.

1001
01:09:11.405 --> 01:09:13.030
Yours and Bączek's.

1002
01:09:16.071 --> 01:09:17.738
I hope he doesn't know about her.

1003
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.446
I told him I had a miscarriage.

1004
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.155
Let's keep it that way.

1005
01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:32.613
Soon we'll allow private currency exchange.

1006
01:09:34.905 --> 01:09:37.071
Kazik, that's something up our alley?

1007
01:09:37.946 --> 01:09:39.571
I'm done with currency.

1008
01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:43.280
Olek might be interested.

1009
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.571
For the country, 
Prime minister!

1010
01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:48.946
Keep the vodka flowing.

1011
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:51.321
Are you doing so well?
With the chocolate?


1012
01:09:51.905 --> 01:09:53.030
It's good money.

1013
01:09:53.696 --> 01:09:54.696
Chocolate?

1014
01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:00.696
To go with the chocolate.

1015
01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:02.488
No hangover!

1016
01:10:03.613 --> 01:10:06.113
This needs to be diluted.

1017
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:07.946
It's all on the label.

1018
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.155
And here's the sports version.

1019
01:10:13.238 --> 01:10:15.071
Limited edition.

1020
01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:17.696
That's good.

1021
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.613
People are bored.
Let them play with spirits.


1022
01:10:23.155 --> 01:10:24.988
There's this company in Sweden.

1023
01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.738
They sell you furniture

1024
01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:29.613
which you have to assemble yourself.

1025
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.030
And people buy it!

1026
01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:32.905
They line up for it!

1027
01:10:32.988 --> 01:10:34.655
Just like here, but they didn't have war.

1028
01:10:34.738 --> 01:10:37.363
Like on this TV show!

1029
01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:39.155
„Do it yourself” with Adam Słodowy.

1030
01:10:40.446 --> 01:10:43.446
Maybe it's his family's business!

1031
01:10:44.613 --> 01:10:46.905
How much do you make on that chocolate?

1032
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:48.946
4-5 million dollars.

1033
01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:50.946
Per week.

1034
01:10:52.238 --> 01:10:54.821
Once I wanted to be like Al Capone.

1035
01:10:55.488 --> 01:10:57.571
Now we're bigger.

1036
01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:01.696
Prime minister, the press is waiting.

1037
01:11:01.738 --> 01:11:03.155
Let them in.

1038
01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:05.696
Hide the booze!

1039
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.446
Don't hide anything!

1040
01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:12.405
Let them see how good we're doing.

1041
01:11:12.821 --> 01:11:15.738
They'll show some respect.

1042
01:11:17.696 --> 01:11:22.280
How are the relations between the government
and private sector?


1043
01:11:22.405 --> 01:11:23.405
Excellent.

1044
01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:27.696
I've just had a great meeting
with top entrepreneurs.


1045
01:11:28.446 --> 01:11:31.863
Supported by a world-famous tennis pro.

1046
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.821
Can there be a better answer?

1047
01:11:33.988 --> 01:11:38.821
Few people know that Poznań is
the business capital of Poland.


1048
01:11:38.905 --> 01:11:41.280
Thank you very much.

1049
01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:43.321
Thank you.

1050
01:11:44.863 --> 01:11:45.863
Ladies and gentlemen,

1051
01:11:46.988 --> 01:11:47.988
please enjoy!

1052
01:11:48.655 --> 01:11:50.363
Compliments of the house!

1053
01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.988
This guy's suit?

1054
01:11:56.113 --> 01:11:57.530
Must be worth 200$.

1055
01:11:57.696 --> 01:11:59.696
A year's wages.

1056
01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:06.238
How did they turn this town into
Poland's booze El Dorado


1057
01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:08.238
even though there are no distilleries here?

1058
01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:10.655
Holier than thou?

1059
01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:12.571
Leave the private business be!

1060
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.071
Go pray to Lenin!

1061
01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.405
Hello, neigbor!

1062
01:13:10.363 --> 01:13:13.196
You're good for nothing!

1063
01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:15.863
Didn't make it again?

1064
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:17.530
Leave me be.

1065
01:13:18.196 --> 01:13:19.988
Should've left it to me.

1066
01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:23.738
We would have swapped the bags with ease.

1067
01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.071
Leave me alone!

1068
01:13:41.113 --> 01:13:42.696
You gave me a bloody nose!

1069
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.613
Maciejak, state police.

1070
01:13:45.238 --> 01:13:47.738
We received a tip
that you robbed a bank.

1071
01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:49.613
That's false information.

1072
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.988
I paid out my savings.

1073
01:13:52.113 --> 01:13:53.905
The company's, that is.

1074
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.155
It's a political matter.

1075
01:13:55.238 --> 01:13:57.280
- Bag the evidence.
- All the money?


1076
01:13:57.446 --> 01:13:58.905
There was a big transaction.

1077
01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:00.821
What can you possibly know.

1078
01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:06.196
You'll never make even half
of what I have here.


1079
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:13.655
What about this?

1080
01:14:13.821 --> 01:14:15.530
- Leave it!
- Are those savings too?


1081
01:14:15.571 --> 01:14:16.738
That's the boy's.

1082
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.405
Neighbour’s boy's! 
They play Monopoly!

1083
01:14:20.071 --> 01:14:22.196
He has too many bags at home.

1084
01:14:22.321 --> 01:14:24.571
He stored them here.

1085
01:14:24.738 --> 01:14:27.321
Are you persecuting children now?

1086
01:14:27.613 --> 01:14:30.196
Some big fish, those kids.

1087
01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:32.613
Listen up!

1088
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.155
I know what you are up to.

1089
01:14:37.196 --> 01:14:38.196
I don't know how,

1090
01:14:38.988 --> 01:14:40.238
but I will find out.

1091
01:14:41.405 --> 01:14:42.405
Do you know why?

1092
01:14:42.696 --> 01:14:43.821
Because I am hard-headed.

1093
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.155
Take everything!

1094
01:14:47.655 --> 01:14:49.363
Lis and his Monopoly too.

1095
01:14:49.488 --> 01:14:52.780
I am an officer of the Polish army!
My father is a general.


1096
01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:55.321
Yes, we know.

1097
01:14:56.155 --> 01:15:00.196
I don't see an officer.
Just a small-time crook


1098
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.071
on a pile of dirty money.

1099
01:15:02.613 --> 01:15:03.613
Take him away.

1100
01:15:04.363 --> 01:15:05.363
But gentlemen!

1101
01:15:06.863 --> 01:15:07.863
Gentlemen!

1102
01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:11.696
Grab everything!

1103
01:15:27.988 --> 01:15:28.988
Kazik?

1104
01:15:29.196 --> 01:15:30.613
They arrested Karol!

1105
01:15:31.155 --> 01:15:32.155
Do something!

1106
01:16:02.446 --> 01:16:03.446
Easy!

1107
01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:27.613
That was the district commander!

1108
01:16:28.071 --> 01:16:29.405
I know the big man.

1109
01:16:30.613 --> 01:16:32.196
We have to let your suspect go!

1110
01:16:32.738 --> 01:16:35.655
Keep him for 48
hours and send him home.

1111
01:16:37.113 --> 01:16:38.571
But we secured the money!

1112
01:16:39.321 --> 01:16:42.363
- I am so close to a testimony!
- Not anymore!


1113
01:16:44.405 --> 01:16:46.530
Warsaw wanted us
to fight illegal booze!


1114
01:16:48.113 --> 01:16:49.113
Wait a second!

1115
01:16:49.655 --> 01:16:51.613
I don't believe it.

1116
01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.030
Are we cops or not?

1117
01:16:54.821 --> 01:16:56.613
Arrest those "King Vodka"-guys.

1118
01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:57.946
They're small time!

1119
01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.530
- Posnania is our Al Capone!
- That was an order!


1120
01:17:01.655 --> 01:17:02.905
Leave Posnania be.

1121
01:17:03.613 --> 01:17:05.238
Exhibition
Marzena Pazik


1122
01:17:15.863 --> 01:17:17.738
You should put a band-aid on it.

1123
01:17:19.155 --> 01:17:20.446
Am I under arrest?

1124
01:17:22.196 --> 01:17:26.071
Please, don't be overly dramatic.

1125
01:17:27.613 --> 01:17:28.821
I'm being dramatic now?

1126
01:17:29.363 --> 01:17:30.988
Can't we just talk?

1127
01:17:31.405 --> 01:17:32.613
Do you need help?

1128
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:34.030
No.

1129
01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:35.571
It's fine.

1130
01:17:35.905 --> 01:17:37.196
Put it over there.

1131
01:17:47.071 --> 01:17:49.530
I am not the enemy.

1132
01:17:50.071 --> 01:17:51.530
I am not trying to hurt you.

1133
01:17:51.571 --> 01:17:53.446
I'd like to help you!

1134
01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:58.488
Help me and I'll help both of you.

1135
01:18:00.821 --> 01:18:01.821
How?

1136
01:18:02.363 --> 01:18:04.738
I need something on Lis and Bączek.

1137
01:18:17.696 --> 01:18:18.696
Is that you?

1138
01:18:22.905 --> 01:18:24.571
That cop knows everything!

1139
01:18:25.655 --> 01:18:26.988
Times are changing!

1140
01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:29.321
Soon you'll lose all protection.

1141
01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.613
We need to leave.

1142
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.530
Now! No discussion!

1143
01:18:33.905 --> 01:18:35.363
I can't take it no more!

1144
01:18:37.738 --> 01:18:40.405
Either we leave or I leave!

1145
01:18:56.321 --> 01:18:57.321
Marzena,

1146
01:19:03.821 --> 01:19:05.030
I am way ahead of you.

1147
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:07.530
I've had enough.

1148
01:19:09.071 --> 01:19:11.571
We'll get married and leave.

1149
01:19:12.155 --> 01:19:13.488
Berlin, USA.

1150
01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:16.488
Some remote island.

1151
01:19:17.363 --> 01:19:19.696
And we'll never leave.

1152
01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:22.071
We have enough money.

1153
01:19:23.363 --> 01:19:24.405
Yes!

1154
01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.196
Remember!

1155
01:19:31.113 --> 01:19:32.863
This is just in case.

1156
01:19:32.946 --> 01:19:34.071
Emergency only.

1157
01:19:36.446 --> 01:19:38.155
- Got it?
- Yes.


1158
01:19:42.488 --> 01:19:43.488
Finally.

1159
01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:45.863
I love you!

1160
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.863
Excuse me, I am looking for Mrs. Dorota.

1161
01:19:58.946 --> 01:20:01.613
What are you doing here?

1162
01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:04.071
I am buying spirit from you!

1163
01:20:04.238 --> 01:20:06.155
It's good stuff!

1164
01:20:06.238 --> 01:20:07.238
Sells quickly.

1165
01:20:07.363 --> 01:20:10.071
Even President Reagan like it!
Pure!


1166
01:20:10.446 --> 01:20:11.613
I'm in a hurry.

1167
01:20:11.738 --> 01:20:12.988
I sold you spirit.

1168
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.196
Good for you!

1169
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.863
I have a second production line!

1170
01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:17.946
Domestic!

1171
01:20:18.196 --> 01:20:19.905
This is how we make money!

1172
01:20:20.363 --> 01:20:23.655
I supply 40 stores!

1173
01:20:23.821 --> 01:20:24.946
Congratulations!

1174
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:27.196
Our product is too expensive!

1175
01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.155
That's why we buy your stuff!
It's cheaper!


1176
01:20:30.363 --> 01:20:32.821
To keep the stores open
and people employed!


1177
01:20:33.405 --> 01:20:35.280
I am buying back
what I sold you!


1178
01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:37.113
The invisible hand in economics!

1179
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:38.571
- Normal thing!
- Normal?


1180
01:20:38.696 --> 01:20:40.030
What is normal about that?

1181
01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.780
I have to go.

1182
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:46.696
Thank you, sir.

1183
01:20:46.988 --> 01:20:49.988
11 billion złoty, as agreed.

1184
01:20:50.363 --> 01:20:51.655
You're like family to me!

1185
01:20:51.988 --> 01:20:52.988
Antek!

1186
01:20:53.113 --> 01:20:54.821
How much is that in dollars?

1187
01:20:54.905 --> 01:20:57.238
I'm used to counting, but so many zeros…

1188
01:20:57.655 --> 01:20:58.821
Around 1 million.

1189
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:04.280
Here's 2 percent commission.

1190
01:21:05.196 --> 01:21:06.988
Tax, if you like.

1191
01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:08.821
And a racket.

1192
01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:11.405
As they say in
the West – excise tax!

1193
01:21:12.821 --> 01:21:14.238
Here's our lost boy!

1194
01:21:14.446 --> 01:21:17.821
Sorry guys, I had a run-in
with the authorities.


1195
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:20.613
Right, now we're complete.

1196
01:21:21.738 --> 01:21:24.738
I hereby open the monthly
friendly family feud!


1197
01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:26.363
Enjoy yourselves!

1198
01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.113
Great speech!

1199
01:21:30.613 --> 01:21:31.613
I know!

1200
01:21:35.696 --> 01:21:36.821
Leaving already?

1201
01:21:37.988 --> 01:21:39.405
I don't feel so well.

1202
01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:42.946
But tomorrow is still on?
I have a new exercise VHS!


1203
01:21:43.155 --> 01:21:44.155
Yes.
Bye.


1204
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.405
Please tell Kazik we left.

1205
01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:49.738
It'll be a wild night.
He won't even notice.


1206
01:21:50.196 --> 01:21:52.030
Know what? I'll come with you.

1207
01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:55.196
Kazik has to watch over business anyway.

1208
01:22:00.446 --> 01:22:01.446
Girls!

1209
01:22:02.405 --> 01:22:03.530
Leaving already?

1210
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:05.946
- Can you give Edyta a lift?
- Of course.


1211
01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.488
I'll be with you in an hour!

1212
01:22:10.113 --> 01:22:11.113
I'll take you.

1213
01:22:15.821 --> 01:22:17.738
Karol! Good to see you!

1214
01:22:17.946 --> 01:22:21.238
Meet our beautiful ladies.

1215
01:22:21.321 --> 01:22:24.321
Żaneta, Monika and Magda!

1216
01:22:24.405 --> 01:22:26.780
I noticed her earlier!

1217
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.238
Come back to bed!

1218
01:22:32.446 --> 01:22:34.155
I'm not done with you yet!

1219
01:22:35.905 --> 01:22:37.571
Shouldn't you go back?

1220
01:22:38.363 --> 01:22:39.905
This whole family feud?

1221
01:22:40.988 --> 01:22:42.655
Look after the business?

1222
01:22:43.571 --> 01:22:44.571
Why?

1223
01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.113
Let the boys think
they have some authority.


1224
01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.196
Don't they?

1225
01:22:53.863 --> 01:22:56.196
I am the one running things!

1226
01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.988
They just play bookkeeping.

1227
01:23:00.696 --> 01:23:01.696
And more.

1228
01:23:02.655 --> 01:23:04.238
I like it when you talk like this.

1229
01:23:04.988 --> 01:23:05.988
How?

1230
01:23:06.488 --> 01:23:07.488
Tough.

1231
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.821
Just like…

1232
01:23:11.113 --> 01:23:12.821
There is no "like"!

1233
01:23:14.363 --> 01:23:16.821
I am better and tougher

1234
01:23:16.905 --> 01:23:18.905
than the lot of you!

1235
01:23:34.363 --> 01:23:35.363
Army.

1236
01:23:37.071 --> 01:23:38.071
Then we have

1237
01:23:38.196 --> 01:23:40.071
central trade administrators.

1238
01:23:44.946 --> 01:23:45.946
State police.

1239
01:23:47.321 --> 01:23:48.738
Military intelligence.

1240
01:23:50.113 --> 01:23:51.530
And politicians.

1241
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.780
So? How about it then?

1242
01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:03.238
And off!

1243
01:24:03.863 --> 01:24:04.863
Look at them.

1244
01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:07.780
As if they had
never seen a naked broad.

1245
01:24:08.946 --> 01:24:10.280
Maybe they haven't.

1246
01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:15.696
What was that on the phone?
Didn't catch a word.


1247
01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:33.780
Ladies, there's a police raid.
We have to evacuate you.


1248
01:24:34.363 --> 01:24:35.613
Police?

1249
01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:37.321
I can't be seen here!

1250
01:24:37.863 --> 01:24:42.405
I am having breakfast
with Princess Diana!


1251
01:24:42.863 --> 01:24:44.655
Take the ladies out through the rear.

1252
01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.905
Let's get going!

1253
01:24:52.238 --> 01:24:55.405
Get the girls and Filip
and go to the next hotel.


1254
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:57.571
Just make it a decent one!

1255
01:24:57.613 --> 01:24:58.905
It'll be all right. Let's go.

1256
01:25:00.488 --> 01:25:02.321
Mr. Komar will take care of it.

1257
01:25:05.113 --> 01:25:06.571
I'm still drunk.

1258
01:25:10.321 --> 01:25:11.321
Just remain calm.

1259
01:25:13.155 --> 01:25:14.905
- Where?
- One o'clock.


1260
01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:18.780
Our dearest wives!

1261
01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:22.571
We've been working through the night…

1262
01:25:24.113 --> 01:25:26.446
…with the board of directors.

1263
01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:30.613
About to have breakfast.

1264
01:25:32.738 --> 01:25:34.613
Maybe you could join us?

1265
01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:37.738
Gladly, our dearest husbands!

1266
01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:39.280
Who are you here to see?

1267
01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:42.030
Excellent idea, this family feud!

1268
01:25:43.321 --> 01:25:46.238
Karol, what is that "family feud"?

1269
01:25:46.363 --> 01:25:47.363
It's just…

1270
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:50.696
Where's that police raid?

1271
01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:53.363
That's the raid?

1272
01:25:53.946 --> 01:25:56.696
Seems worse than the police.

1273
01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:01.488
"Family feud" is the meeting
of store managers.


1274
01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.613
We are almost like a big family!

1275
01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:11.113
And the other hotel was crap.

1276
01:26:11.655 --> 01:26:14.613
Filip is abroad, from what I hear?

1277
01:26:14.821 --> 01:26:17.446
And he left us 2 dollars.

1278
01:26:17.905 --> 01:26:18.905
Bye then!

1279
01:26:22.613 --> 01:26:24.321
Four beef tartare, please.

1280
01:26:26.696 --> 01:26:27.696
Karol!

1281
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.321
Cheating is for the competent!

1282
01:26:32.446 --> 01:26:34.738
Our husbands will pay for the cleaning.

1283
01:26:46.196 --> 01:26:47.196
Lead the way!

1284
01:27:06.071 --> 01:27:09.030
Let me introduce you.
Captain Jan Sebastian.


1285
01:27:09.071 --> 01:27:11.363
We have already met.

1286
01:27:22.196 --> 01:27:24.863
I never asked his first name.

1287
01:27:25.196 --> 01:27:28.155
Ladies like men in uniform.
Am I right?


1288
01:27:33.196 --> 01:27:35.030
How dare you cheat on me!

1289
01:27:37.655 --> 01:27:39.613
You sluts!

1290
01:27:41.696 --> 01:27:45.155
How can you not care about the parties?

1291
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:49.655
We have our own deal.

1292
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:51.613
He has to look after the business.

1293
01:27:51.988 --> 01:27:53.863
Push your pelvis out.

1294
01:27:54.321 --> 01:27:55.655
That's so pretty!

1295
01:27:57.446 --> 01:27:58.863
Antek gave it to you?

1296
01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:03.113
Did he propose?

1297
01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:07.030
Yes, but… don't tell!
It's a secret!


1298
01:28:07.196 --> 01:28:08.780
Sure thing.

1299
01:28:09.321 --> 01:28:11.446
That is great news!

1300
01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.405
Tell me all about it!

1301
01:28:31.321 --> 01:28:32.863
- There you go.
- Thanks.


1302
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.946
Wasn't that Marzena?

1303
01:28:59.696 --> 01:29:01.113
Do you have something to tell me?

1304
01:29:01.488 --> 01:29:02.488
Anything?

1305
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:12.280
Antek and Marzena have enough.

1306
01:29:12.363 --> 01:29:13.821
They met this stubborn cop

1307
01:29:14.321 --> 01:29:16.780
with ties to Warsaw.

1308
01:29:16.863 --> 01:29:21.321
And he guaranteed them immunity.

1309
01:29:22.821 --> 01:29:24.946
Provided Antek rats on Kazik and Karol.

1310
01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:29.821
And?

1311
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:34.446
They'll get married, go on honeymoon

1312
01:29:34.488 --> 01:29:35.905
and never come back.

1313
01:29:36.321 --> 01:29:37.321
Live abroad.

1314
01:29:38.363 --> 01:29:39.988
Good job, Sabrina!

1315
01:29:42.696 --> 01:29:44.238
And now the address.

1316
01:30:00.446 --> 01:30:01.946
This country has laws.

1317
01:30:17.196 --> 01:30:18.905
You gave your child away.

1318
01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:22.363
You can't be in touch.

1319
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.696
And I still need you.

1320
01:30:34.821 --> 01:30:38.113
Your time is over!

1321
01:30:44.946 --> 01:30:47.571
Our time is about to begin, Goldilocks!

1322
01:31:24.821 --> 01:31:26.238
There's this saying.

1323
01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.655
Lord, protect me from my friends.

1324
01:31:28.821 --> 01:31:30.488
I can take care of my enemies.

1325
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:31.780
That was the case with Bączek.

1326
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:35.030
Starczewski told him that we wanted out.

1327
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:37.238
He had no scruples.

1328
01:32:10.113 --> 01:32:11.405
Antoni Kafer!

1329
01:32:16.071 --> 01:32:18.780
An interesting car
for an interesting man!


1330
01:32:21.363 --> 01:32:22.571
Courtesy of me and Karol.

1331
01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:23.738
All the best!

1332
01:32:26.071 --> 01:32:27.405
Good luck, Marzena!

1333
01:32:28.946 --> 01:32:29.988
Like the colour?

1334
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:33.946
Do you know how much power it has?

1335
01:32:34.488 --> 01:32:39.738
You have to go
150 km/h to feel it.

1336
01:32:40.863 --> 01:32:43.280
The speedo maxes out at 160.

1337
01:32:43.988 --> 01:32:45.655
Sorry for being late!

1338
01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:48.780
You've met Helena, I believe.

1339
01:32:49.113 --> 01:32:51.488
- I know you!
- I'm pregnant.


1340
01:32:52.363 --> 01:32:54.238
Congratulations!

1341
01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.655
How could this happen?

1342
01:32:58.821 --> 01:33:01.571
I thought you never took the rubber off.

1343
01:33:02.238 --> 01:33:04.613
I am scratching my head over this myself.

1344
01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.071
What a pimped out ride!

1345
01:33:07.155 --> 01:33:09.363
- Whose is it?
- I guess it's ours now.


1346
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:11.196
We have to go for a cruise!

1347
01:33:41.155 --> 01:33:42.863
Our last night in Poland.

1348
01:34:00.196 --> 01:34:02.696
We'll leave all the shit behind.

1349
01:34:03.613 --> 01:34:04.655
And we'll have…

1350
01:34:04.738 --> 01:34:05.988
Beautiful children!

1351
01:34:06.405 --> 01:34:08.071
Oh yes!

1352
01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:10.446
And we shall raise them…

1353
01:34:11.696 --> 01:34:13.113
To be honest people!

1354
01:34:35.988 --> 01:34:37.363
I love you!

1355
01:36:13.905 --> 01:36:15.405
Remember me, wise-ass?

1356
01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:17.530
Barely.

1357
01:36:17.613 --> 01:36:19.905
You sold me a fake icon.
I got locked up!


1358
01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:22.405
It's a misunderstanding.

1359
01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:24.571
My marriage was a misunderstanding.

1360
01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.655
Go to the police then!

1361
01:36:28.613 --> 01:36:31.155
- I take care of business personally!
- I'm in a hurry.


1362
01:36:34.613 --> 01:36:36.155
You bastard!
Get him!


1363
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:19.280
The well is dry.

1364
01:38:21.113 --> 01:38:23.530
Next week we're out of business.

1365
01:38:23.613 --> 01:38:25.238
Taxes and customs on booze.

1366
01:38:26.905 --> 01:38:28.321
Prohibition is over.

1367
01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:31.113
Bye, bye, Capone!

1368
01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:32.196
Really?

1369
01:38:32.405 --> 01:38:35.071
Antek is fighting for his life
and all you can think of is booze?


1370
01:38:35.155 --> 01:38:36.363
He's your friend!

1371
01:38:37.738 --> 01:38:38.738
You are right.

1372
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:40.030
Sorry.

1373
01:38:41.863 --> 01:38:45.905
And he had all the passwords.

1374
01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:48.488
To access the money.

1375
01:39:35.905 --> 01:39:37.196
My dearest Marzena!

1376
01:39:38.196 --> 01:39:39.780
If you're reading this,

1377
01:39:39.821 --> 01:39:40.905
things are bad.

1378
01:39:41.571 --> 01:39:42.571
Don't weep.

1379
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.780
Not now.

1380
01:39:44.363 --> 01:39:45.780
There's always time to mourn.

1381
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:47.571
You have to act now.

1382
01:39:47.863 --> 01:39:48.863
And for that…

1383
01:39:49.571 --> 01:39:50.613
You need money.

1384
01:39:51.655 --> 01:39:54.571
I divided the company's assets
in three equal parts.


1385
01:39:55.321 --> 01:39:57.321
The passwords are hidden at home.

1386
01:39:57.696 --> 01:39:58.738
You know where.

1387
01:39:59.571 --> 01:40:00.821
Now the important part.

1388
01:40:01.446 --> 01:40:04.696
Get your money before you
give the guys their share.


1389
01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:05.780
That is crucial!

1390
01:40:05.863 --> 01:40:07.363
You first. Then them.

1391
01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:10.321
It's your only chance.

1392
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:12.405
Do it now.
Instantly.


1393
01:40:18.696 --> 01:40:21.780
Life creates the most unbelievable stories.

1394
01:40:22.238 --> 01:40:24.155
This story has a colorful continuation.

1395
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.321
Even though I was
convinced my life was over.
