1
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:32.140
Hello?

2
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:12.222
Good morning, is your mother in?

3
00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:57.351
Are your ready?

4
00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.065
I need to go now.

5
00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.202
Jesus, the son of God...

6
00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:19.164
...descended to earth and suffered...

7
00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:21.958
...to pay for our sins.

8
00:03:49.402 --> 00:03:52.989
THIRTY YEARS LATER

9
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:54.491
<i>You're in danger.</i>

10
00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:57.702
<i>I don't care
as long as I'm near you.</i>


11
00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:01.832
<i>I never thanked you for your help.</i>

12
00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:04.251
<i>It was brave, very courageous.</i>

13
00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:06.795
<i>I've never seen anybody so beautiful.</i>

14
00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:09.714
<i>I think I'm in love with you.</i>

15
00:04:12.134 --> 00:04:15.095
<i>- You'll come with me to the police?
- No.</i>


16
00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:16.388
<i>Why?</i>

17
00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:20.141
<i>I killed Charles Ringan.</i>

18
00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.435
<i>Would you tell the Commissioner?</i>

19
00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:25.146
<i>If you insist.</i>

20
00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:28.859
<i>I don't want to.</i>

21
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.571
<i>Listen, I'm very tired, 
I feel stiff.</i>

22
00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:37.242
<i>I killed a man and I witnessed
the murder of a poor soul.</i>


23
00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:40.996
<i>It's all because Geiger was singing Carmen.</i>

24
00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:45.125
<i>If I told, your house would
be invaded by police...</i>


25
00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.044
<i>...before you'd have time to flee.</i>

26
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.829
<i>Perhaps she'll recover.
I've seen it in the past.</i>


27
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:26.875
<i>We'll let your father know about Ringan.</i>

28
00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:29.002
<i>You forgot something.</i>

29
00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:31.212
<i>Me?</i>

30
00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:34.132
<i>What do you have?</i>

31
00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:37.302
<i>Nothing you can't heal.</i>

32
00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:55.487
OH!

33
00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:21.137
"The Slide Whistle Micmacs"

34
00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.486
If I extract the bullet,
he may become a vegetable.


35
00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:22.448
If I don't extract it,
he'll be living on a knife edge.


36
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.493
Better to be alive
and at risk of dying...

37
00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:28.496
...than to live without being
conscious of living.


38
00:07:28.788 --> 00:07:31.416
This is closer to philosophy then medicine.

39
00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.585
Heads or Tails?

40
00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:37.755
Heads!

41
00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:42.010
OK, I'll leave it be.
It will set off airport alarms!


42
00:08:02.864 --> 00:08:04.490
They changed the lock.

43
00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:08.161
What happened,
did you comb your hair with a can opener?


44
00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:10.038
Where are my belongings?

45
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.457
Initially, in the cellar.
But you know people...


46
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:17.086
After 3 days, there was
little more than odd socks left.


47
00:08:24.844 --> 00:08:25.887
That's my cap

48
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:30.516
Hey...

49
00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:56.959
My little Bazil...

50
00:08:57.251 --> 00:08:59.462
For you,
they fell off the back of a truck.


51
00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:01.130
100% cotton.

52
00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:04.926
You've a job, you'll find a new home.

53
00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:12.642
Good morning.
Is Serge in?


54
00:09:12.934 --> 00:09:15.895
Well! If it isn't Bazil!
You've come back!


55
00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:17.522
I almost didn't.

56
00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:20.691
I hope they took the lead
from your head.


57
00:09:20.983 --> 00:09:23.277
I'm back, faithful to the position.

58
00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:26.239
But the position was not faithful to you.

59
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:27.698
I had to replace you.

60
00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:31.244
This is Lola.

61
00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:33.037
Three month trial.

62
00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:36.290
We just signed a permanent contract.
Ah...


63
00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:39.335
Well, we haven't kissed...

64
00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:50.179
Mr Bazil!

65
00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:53.099
Don't listen to him.
In fact, I have a boyfriend.


66
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:54.851
His name's Ricardo.

67
00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:59.021
He picks me up
every night on his motorbike.

68
00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:00.648
He always parks over there.

69
00:10:01.274 --> 00:10:03.359
Where you were shot.

70
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:05.027
One day, while riding...

71
00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:10.616
We heard a little noise,
like a pebble stuck in the tyre.


72
00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:15.329
Mr Bazil, it was no pebble.

73
00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:18.332
Which hand?

74
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.045
Try again.

75
00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:36.893
<i>She puts her head under her feet
and her toes in her nose</i>


76
00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:40.313
<i>And then does the splits</i>

77
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:43.983
<i>She spins and
coils like a caterpillar</i>


78
00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:47.028
<i>Suddenly, her legs around his neck</i>

79
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.949
<i>She spins, like ball
And nibbles his knees</i>


80
00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:55.369
<i>The rubber woman</i>

81
00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:58.831
<i>With her, what fun they can have
Ah, it's crazy</i>


82
00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:02.335
<i>It's enough
to make you go funny in the head</i>


83
00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:06.297
<i>They search below
And they find it underneath</i>


84
00:11:06.714 --> 00:11:09.800
<i>The rubber woman</i>

85
00:11:10.676 --> 00:11:11.844
Thank you...

86
00:13:36.155 --> 00:13:37.448
You got five minutes?

87
00:13:41.493 --> 00:13:43.412
I spent my life in jail.

88
00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:45.414
So they call me "Closet".

89
00:13:46.123 --> 00:13:47.166
Mine's Bazil.

90
00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:49.335
I know.
You're a sweet in jar.


91
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:54.298
You've been on the streets for 2 months,

92
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.509
but you're not beaten, you have a purpose.
What is it?


93
00:13:58.385 --> 00:13:59.637
I live day to day.

94
00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:03.098
With the bullet,
that can make me trip out anytime.


95
00:14:03.807 --> 00:14:06.727
Me, the widow maker gave me
this injury.


96
00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.355
The guillotine in 59.

97
00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:13.400
The guillotine jammed.

98
00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:15.736
It happened 2 times.
I was pardoned.


99
00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:17.947
Get that bullet out of your head.

100
00:14:18.906 --> 00:14:21.742
Impossible.
The surgeon said...


101
00:14:22.034 --> 00:14:23.035
Because...

102
00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:27.039
You follow me.
A family will adopt you.


103
00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:51.730
Hi.

104
00:14:52.022 --> 00:14:53.232
Hi!

105
00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:55.859
That's Max.
Here we're home.


106
00:14:56.652 --> 00:14:59.571
We share our home.
This is our little goose of the Capitol.


107
00:14:59.863 --> 00:15:01.782
If the robber is pointing...

108
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.455
Ha! Ha!
Go, go, my little guy.


109
00:15:27.683 --> 00:15:29.560
Come on in, don't be shy.

110
00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:46.535
Wakey...

111
00:15:46.827 --> 00:15:48.162
Come, let me introduce you.

112
00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:52.249
She decides who is recruited.

113
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:55.502
You collect stray bullets?
Yes, ma'am.


114
00:15:55.794 --> 00:15:56.879
Say!

115
00:15:57.337 --> 00:15:58.922
I'm Tambouille.

116
00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:02.384
Here stuff is recovered,
we sort it and repair it.


117
00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:04.428
Everybody together.

118
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.180
Even little Pierre.

119
00:16:06.722 --> 00:16:09.766
And he's an artist.

120
00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:20.819
He brings anything we can use.

121
00:17:00.442 --> 00:17:01.568
59...

122
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.111
42...

123
00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:05.072
104!

124
00:17:07.866 --> 00:17:08.992
Nickel.

125
00:17:09.284 --> 00:17:12.663
She's called "Calculator".
Father and mother unknown.


126
00:17:12.955 --> 00:17:15.207
He has a compass in his eye.

127
00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:18.335
The white man
a compass in the eye


128
00:17:18.627 --> 00:17:21.713
...starvation,
begins at the top...


129
00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:24.091
...and goes from cock to the ass.
Yes!


130
00:17:24.383 --> 00:17:26.260
"The compass in the eye".
Note.


131
00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:29.054
He was a writer in Brazil.

132
00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:31.306
Fracasse is my name.

133
00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:33.016
I have carbon staples...

134
00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:34.685
...in my throat.

135
00:17:34.977 --> 00:17:38.814
He lost a lung in a
water bottle explosion


136
00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:42.651
...and also have a bicycle Dynamo
in my stomach


137
00:17:42.943 --> 00:17:45.237
...and 3 neck joints
of titanium.


138
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:49.324
Well, go ahead, tap away.
Go ahead, it's titanium!


139
00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:50.534
Go!
Go ahead!


140
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.327
Oh!

141
00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:55.247
He dreams of getting his name
in the Guinness Book of Records.


142
00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:59.167
I already did. in 77!

143
00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:01.503
We never saw
the certificate.


144
00:18:01.795 --> 00:18:03.880
I was robbed!
I've told you already.


145
00:18:05.382 --> 00:18:07.759
Hey, you!
Why do you get him upset?


146
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:20.897
Now that you belong to our
family...


147
00:18:21.189 --> 00:18:25.694
...get me a small pot of cream
from the fridge.


148
00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:40.584
Further down, boy!

149
00:18:43.503 --> 00:18:44.129
Aaaahh!

150
00:18:51.553 --> 00:18:52.679
You want my picture?

151
00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:54.973
She's a little snappish...

152
00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:59.186
...but she's always the first
to bend for others...


153
00:18:59.478 --> 00:19:02.981
You're a contortionist?
No, I am the vegetable crisper!


154
00:19:03.273 --> 00:19:04.816
She was like that from birth...

155
00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:08.779
At 5, she was already hiding
in the pantry.


156
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.490
And he remained so long
in the closet...


157
00:19:11.782 --> 00:19:15.535
...without laces in his shoes
that he's forgot how to tie them!


158
00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:19.247
Come!

159
00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:22.042
Go to the table, the mash is ready.

160
00:19:37.182 --> 00:19:39.017
*Speaking a Flemish dialect*

161
00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:16.007
Can I help you?

162
00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:19.344
Yes, I would like to see Mr. 
De Fenouillet.

163
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:21.387
Of course,
you have an appointment?


164
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:24.349
That is to say,
I have something in mind.


165
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:25.850
It concerns him.

166
00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:29.604
If this is a project or idea,
send an email.


167
00:22:29.896 --> 00:22:34.234
I could send him a scan,
but I prefer to see him.


168
00:22:34.526 --> 00:22:36.194
You'll have to leave.

169
00:22:36.486 --> 00:22:37.445
Yes. Warning!

170
00:22:37.737 --> 00:22:38.488
Warning!

171
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.907
Warning! Warning!

172
00:22:51.292 --> 00:22:52.043
Boo!

173
00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:55.129
Show this clown to the street, that's all.

174
00:22:56.172 --> 00:22:57.840
A bullet in the head?

175
00:22:58.132 --> 00:23:00.468
At least he'll remember us!

176
00:23:27.829 --> 00:23:30.290
Guys, I need someone here!
Go!


177
00:23:46.973 --> 00:23:49.600
You know we're leaders...

178
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:52.687
...in the field of cluster munitions.

179
00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:56.399
We have quadrupled our sales
in the Gulf...


180
00:23:57.108 --> 00:24:00.695
...decreased by 7 to 9%
on collateral damage.


181
00:24:01.696 --> 00:24:04.741
As you know, we're not monsters.

182
00:24:05.033 --> 00:24:07.285
We don't want anyone dead.

183
00:24:07.577 --> 00:24:09.162
We all know too well...

184
00:24:09.454 --> 00:24:12.999
...that a wounded soldier is more expensive
than a dead soldier!


185
00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:18.046
Our CBS-87 fires off

186
00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:21.341
...and cleans the equivalent
of 4 football fields.


187
00:24:21.632 --> 00:24:24.802
We have been present in the Gulf, Kosovo...

188
00:24:25.887 --> 00:24:29.015
..and Afghanistan...
In short, it's time to call...


189
00:24:29.307 --> 00:24:32.602
...to this forum
the architect of our success.


190
00:24:32.894 --> 00:24:35.688
Our CEO...
FranÃ§ois Marconi!


191
00:24:39.901 --> 00:24:42.320
Thank you, Thank you.
Thank you very much.


192
00:24:47.742 --> 00:24:49.702
Tracers...

193
00:24:50.203 --> 00:24:52.997
...explosives or bullets...

194
00:24:53.289 --> 00:24:55.458
...ours are the best...

195
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.211
...the most aggressive and successful.

196
00:25:02.173 --> 00:25:05.468
Rimbaud started out as a poet,
but is now an arms dealer.


197
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.304
Well, I...
I'll do the opposite.


198
00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:10.807
But until retirement...

199
00:25:11.349 --> 00:25:15.019
..I will continue to rhyme
ambition with ammunition...


200
00:25:15.311 --> 00:25:17.480
...Living with dynamite.

201
00:25:17.772 --> 00:25:20.900
Long live Vigilante Armament!

202
00:25:39.252 --> 00:25:41.003
Goodnight, Mr. President.

203
00:25:42.004 --> 00:25:43.714
General...

204
00:25:44.006 --> 00:25:45.967
Joseph, good night!

205
00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:28.718
May I remind you...

206
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.720
...of the new rule in effect.

207
00:26:31.012 --> 00:26:34.682
A landmine was placed
under the playing surface.


208
00:26:34.974 --> 00:26:37.310
Yes, it is a renewed challenge...

209
00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:39.061
...offered by the league.

210
00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:45.818
The suspense was short lived
as the centre -forward...


211
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.780
...the visiting team
just payed the price.


212
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.711
You were brilliant tonight.
Thank you, Georges.


213
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.049
Arthur Rimbaud was an arms dealer,
in history?


214
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:12.219
Yes, but it didn't prevent him from dying
of gangrene, when they amputated his leg.


215
00:27:14.388 --> 00:27:16.140
Baudelaire, of syphilis?

216
00:27:16.432 --> 00:27:17.683
Verlaine, delirium tremens...

217
00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:19.852
...Lorca was shot...

218
00:27:20.144 --> 00:27:22.146
...Nerval hanged himself from a lamppost.

219
00:27:22.438 --> 00:27:26.108
I will never encourage my son to
become a poet, sir.


220
00:27:36.827 --> 00:27:39.705
Tomorrow,
wake me up at 10am.


221
00:27:41.082 --> 00:27:42.166
Yes, sir.

222
00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:47.505
You've worked for us for how long?

223
00:27:48.756 --> 00:27:49.965
30 years next month.

224
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:51.550
Ah...

225
00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:53.469
Why don't we...

226
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:56.972
...upgrade this place for your 30 years?

227
00:27:57.264 --> 00:27:59.600
With some hightech equipment.

228
00:28:00.935 --> 00:28:04.563
The old pots make the best soups.

229
00:28:05.272 --> 00:28:06.398
Hum...

230
00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:08.275
Change is coming.

231
00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:11.946
At least once every 30 years.

232
00:30:20.199 --> 00:30:22.451
Why can't he sleep at
the foot of the bed?

233
00:30:22.743 --> 00:30:24.161
Stop moaning!

234
00:30:24.453 --> 00:30:26.163
Birds of a Feather.

235
00:30:26.455 --> 00:30:28.499
Hey, Grandma?
Croutons!


236
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.695
The day went well?

237
00:30:58.987 --> 00:31:01.407
Yes, papa!
I was brilliant tonight.


238
00:31:01.698 --> 00:31:05.494
My Speech was fantastic,
I was compared to Rimbaud.


239
00:31:05.786 --> 00:31:06.912
You know who he is?

240
00:31:07.204 --> 00:31:08.747
Yes, but your not that muscular.

241
00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:13.877
No, not "Rambo" darling... "Rimbaud".

242
00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:18.423
Put him to bed.

243
00:31:18.715 --> 00:31:19.800
Yes, Sir.

244
00:32:44.343 --> 00:32:46.386
Hello, Yes.

245
00:32:46.678 --> 00:32:49.932
No, wait...
How did you get this number?


246
00:32:50.223 --> 00:32:51.350
Yes, I see.

247
00:32:51.642 --> 00:32:55.479
No, not this kind of transaction,
not over the phone.


248
00:32:55.771 --> 00:32:57.773
No! neither...

249
00:32:58.065 --> 00:32:59.816
I prefer a public place.

250
00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:01.943
I know... Say Wednesday...

251
00:33:02.235 --> 00:33:04.780
...3pm, the sports department
of Galeries Lafayette.


252
00:33:05.405 --> 00:33:06.531
Yes, that's it.

253
00:33:19.127 --> 00:33:20.087
Waffles...

254
00:33:20.379 --> 00:33:21.296
...in Brussels!

255
00:33:23.507 --> 00:33:26.718
Don't eat too much, 
I put rum in the batter.

256
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.261
Hey, stop!

257
00:33:28.553 --> 00:33:31.765
*Speaking in Flemish dialect*

258
00:33:39.064 --> 00:33:41.817
*She speaks Chinese*

259
00:33:45.195 --> 00:33:48.532
Hurry, the minots!
They'll be ready soon!


260
00:33:48.824 --> 00:33:50.242
Mr Fracasse...

261
00:33:50.951 --> 00:33:53.912
Isn't this you, here in the
Guinness Book of Records?


262
00:33:54.204 --> 00:33:55.497
Yikes!

263
00:33:56.748 --> 00:33:58.250
The 77!

264
00:34:01.128 --> 00:34:02.796
What did I tell you!

265
00:34:03.088 --> 00:34:06.133
What did I tell you...
Ha! Ha!


266
00:34:08.009 --> 00:34:11.012
"On July 14, 1977,
Theodore Henri de Montreuil"...


267
00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:13.265
Who is Theodore Henry?

268
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.517
..."beat by 9 metres"...

269
00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:20.063
..."the record for Human-Canonball
established by Mr. Grampee in 66"! Ha!


270
00:34:20.355 --> 00:34:24.192
"Beat by 9 metres!"

271
00:34:29.072 --> 00:34:29.906
Yes!

272
00:34:33.785 --> 00:34:35.495
Give it to me, kid?
Oh no.


273
00:34:35.787 --> 00:34:37.289
Ah yes, please, give me.

274
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:40.041
But no...
If you give to me...


275
00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.419
You autograph my T-shirt, then.

276
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.924
"T. Henri"...

277
00:34:48.216 --> 00:34:49.676
Thierry Henri.

278
00:34:49.968 --> 00:34:52.304
Fracasso, I have a job for you.

279
00:34:52.596 --> 00:34:54.556
I'm not joking...

280
00:34:54.848 --> 00:34:57.350
...but I think
there's a catch.


281
00:34:57.642 --> 00:34:59.936
You've an idea in mind?

282
00:35:00.979 --> 00:35:03.607
Mister poses a mystery.

283
00:35:03.857 --> 00:35:06.651
Well, who cares, you're not curious.

284
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:19.497
Oh...Oh!

285
00:35:26.463 --> 00:35:27.464
What time?

286
00:35:27.756 --> 00:35:31.343
Tomorrow, 10am,
opposite the tomb of Sacha Guitry.


287
00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:56.451
Mister Marconi?

288
00:35:57.619 --> 00:35:59.955
I am the messenger
of Omar Boulounga.


289
00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:03.208
Omar Boulounga...
The former dictator...?


290
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.545
The former and the next.
He's preparing a revolution.


291
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.173
I don't have a polical view.

292
00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:14.177
We require rifles, grenades and mines.

293
00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:18.056
And the DGA, the Export Committee,
the Ottawa Treaty?


294
00:36:18.348 --> 00:36:20.308
You have the weapons.
In stock.


295
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.478
You don't have an export sector in Zamibia.

296
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.605
We'd like one.

297
00:36:25.897 --> 00:36:29.317
And this should interest me?
Check us out.


298
00:36:29.609 --> 00:36:34.698
We'll give you double the cash and more...
in diamonds if the coup succeeds.


299
00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:35.949
Continue.

300
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:38.118
Mr. Bouloungas' national account...

301
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.911
...the diamond mines...

302
00:36:40.203 --> 00:36:43.289
Don't Sneeze!
Think of something, fast!


303
00:36:43.581 --> 00:36:47.585
Zebras are white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?


304
00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:49.003
Oh, pygmies!

305
00:36:49.295 --> 00:36:52.173
Are there dwarfs among pygmies?

306
00:36:52.465 --> 00:36:54.467
Why do we say "CIA" and not "If
-E
-O"?

307
00:36:54.759 --> 00:36:57.387
Or "FBI
-Ouch" and not "FBI?

308
00:36:57.679 --> 00:36:58.722
Think...

309
00:36:59.013 --> 00:37:02.058
...but do not delay too much,
we returned to Conakry on Monday.


310
00:37:28.334 --> 00:37:29.252
You!

311
00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:32.005
Yes, You!

312
00:37:32.297 --> 00:37:34.507
I don't know what your shenanigans
are about...


313
00:37:34.799 --> 00:37:38.261
...but either you go and continue
doing everything by yourself...


314
00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:41.431
...or you stay and ask us for help.

315
00:37:41.723 --> 00:37:43.391
Am I clear?

316
00:37:43.683 --> 00:37:45.643
Some of them want to help me?

317
00:37:45.935 --> 00:37:46.978
What?

318
00:37:48.146 --> 00:37:52.358
I found the manufacturer of the bullet
that killed my father.


319
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.946
I need to do two things at once
I can't do it alone.


320
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.078
Stick together...

321
00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:14.005
They're the watchmen.

322
00:38:14.297 --> 00:38:16.925
Inside is the dealer.

323
00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:20.136
The drug's hidden in the mailbox.

324
00:38:20.428 --> 00:38:22.722
That way, if they're ever searched...

325
00:38:23.014 --> 00:38:25.433
...they are white as snow. Let's go!

326
00:38:36.194 --> 00:38:40.782
You've already done it for the crash
and whiplash at the same time?


327
00:38:41.074 --> 00:38:42.325
You're old school.

328
00:38:47.747 --> 00:38:48.665
Yes?

329
00:38:48.957 --> 00:38:51.918
Asbestos Control. 
A problem was reported.

330
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.420
But there's no asbestos here!

331
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.549
We didn't find asbestos in
the devil vauvert.


332
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.884
From the crack of dawn...

333
00:39:00.176 --> 00:39:02.553
...we dealt with that problem.

334
00:39:02.845 --> 00:39:05.473
So, no need to rock the boat.

335
00:39:05.765 --> 00:39:06.849
Ah!

336
00:39:07.433 --> 00:39:08.935
Oh! But...

337
00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:11.396
The widow told me she'd
never leave.


338
00:39:11.688 --> 00:39:14.983
Wherever I go, it's on my back.

339
00:39:15.274 --> 00:39:16.317
Hats off!

340
00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:40.842
And my receipt?

341
00:39:41.134 --> 00:39:43.302
The more one drinks,
the more one is right!

342
00:40:02.363 --> 00:40:04.991
The boarding hall, please?

343
00:40:08.453 --> 00:40:13.124
My brother, you want a magical necklace?
Get you into heaven.


344
00:40:13.416 --> 00:40:16.627
This powder wards off evil spirits.

345
00:40:16.919 --> 00:40:18.337
But yes! Ha! Ha!

346
00:40:18.629 --> 00:40:21.048
Ah, you're the boss? Commander!

347
00:40:28.222 --> 00:40:29.223
Here!

348
00:40:29.515 --> 00:40:31.350
It will protect you against the devil...

349
00:40:31.642 --> 00:40:32.810
...and the vagaries of fait.

350
00:40:33.102 --> 00:40:36.105
Incense that'll allow you to contact
the deceased.


351
00:40:36.397 --> 00:40:40.735
Let the passengers be!
I've told you a 100 times!


352
00:40:41.027 --> 00:40:42.987
This is your last warning. Get away!

353
00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:47.533
Sorry, gentlemen.
I wish you a safe journey.


354
00:41:04.926 --> 00:41:06.969
Excuse me, please sir.

355
00:41:07.261 --> 00:41:08.179
Hello.

356
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:10.097
We're after a flight to America.

357
00:41:10.389 --> 00:41:11.933
The departure hall?

358
00:41:12.225 --> 00:41:14.393
Yes, we're off to Manhattan to visit...

359
00:41:14.685 --> 00:41:15.686
...my son.

360
00:41:16.979 --> 00:41:19.232
You must register your baggage before.

361
00:41:19.524 --> 00:41:20.858
She's the stepsister...

362
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.070
...my son who left
in 1989 for New York.

363
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.199
New York...
You're talking to me?


364
00:41:28.908 --> 00:41:30.159
In 1988.

365
00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:31.702
On December 12, 1988.

366
00:42:04.944 --> 00:42:07.071
*Last call for Conakry*

367
00:42:07.363 --> 00:42:09.407
*Lufthansa Flight 202*

368
00:42:14.453 --> 00:42:16.664
The vertebra of Tino Rossi.

369
00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:21.335
Winston Churchills
Fingernail clippings.


370
00:42:24.588 --> 00:42:26.257
The molar of Marilyn...

371
00:42:27.633 --> 00:42:28.926
Monroe.

372
00:42:31.721 --> 00:42:34.223
The foot of Salma Lazarus...

373
00:42:34.515 --> 00:42:36.100
Heart of Louis XVI.

374
00:42:36.392 --> 00:42:38.060
The finger of Matisse.

375
00:42:39.854 --> 00:42:41.981
The eye of Mussolini...

376
00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:52.616
It is expected that the DGA launched
the study and called the Saudis...


377
00:42:52.908 --> 00:42:56.787
Yes, it was an individual effort more
than group...rather well done.


378
00:42:58.164 --> 00:43:01.042
Well, they will not provide the
source code.


379
00:43:01.959 --> 00:43:05.755
If it works?
Remember the Sarajevo market...


380
00:43:21.604 --> 00:43:26.525
Collateral damage added value
in the media.


381
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.620
But of course...

382
00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:44.710
That's why it kills me to say.

383
00:43:45.669 --> 00:43:47.421
You and I, we work...

384
00:43:48.506 --> 00:43:50.633
...in the defense industry...

385
00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:52.885
...not in the attack industry.

386
00:43:53.177 --> 00:43:55.387
I beg you, dear friend.

387
00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:57.932
You are always welcome.

388
00:43:58.682 --> 00:44:00.017
My respects to madame.

389
00:44:39.807 --> 00:44:43.644
Appointment at 5 pm Train Bleu restaurant:
The eye of Mussolini has arrived.


390
00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:55.739
I'm already 10 minutes late,
hurry!


391
00:44:59.868 --> 00:45:01.036
What was that, Maurice?

392
00:45:01.328 --> 00:45:03.205
"It's Stephen", sir.
Stephen, yes!


393
00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:06.750
We have a puncture, I think.
Sorry, I'll see.


394
00:45:10.087 --> 00:45:11.255
Peasant!

395
00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:33.694
Hello.

396
00:45:33.986 --> 00:45:37.239
I have a reservation
in the name of De Fenouillet.


397
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.658
Yes.
You are expected.


398
00:45:45.372 --> 00:45:47.750
I am Mr. De Fenouillet's right hand.

399
00:45:48.042 --> 00:45:51.962
He asked me to tell you that the
Eye of Mussolini interests him


400
00:45:52.254 --> 00:45:56.759
In exchange for Achilles heel and
Adam's apple of...


401
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:05.100
1, 2, 3...test.

402
00:46:05.392 --> 00:46:08.353
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

403
00:46:24.495 --> 00:46:26.538
Go ahead, make me an offer.

404
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.125
Do not put the cart
before the horse. It will save us...


405
00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:32.836
...from having 2 feet
in the same hoof.


406
00:46:34.379 --> 00:46:36.298
If you have the Eye of Mussolini...

407
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.718
...I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.

408
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.969
It's worth it.

409
00:46:41.678 --> 00:46:44.097
I've got the finger of Matisse
and fingernails Churchill...


410
00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:47.184
...name the price.
What say you, Mr. Lazarus?


411
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:51.438
Mr. Lazarus has had a setback,
he had to leave.


412
00:46:52.606 --> 00:46:55.567
Unfortunately,
Mr. Lazarus has had to stand you up.


413
00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:57.653
He's returned to his household.

414
00:46:58.195 --> 00:46:59.279
Who are you?

415
00:47:00.906 --> 00:47:04.284
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

416
00:47:05.702 --> 00:47:06.829
Boulounga?

417
00:47:07.704 --> 00:47:09.957
I thought...
We were done?


418
00:47:10.249 --> 00:47:11.124
Nay.

419
00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:13.710
A popular revolution...

420
00:47:14.837 --> 00:47:16.755
A popular revolution...

421
00:47:17.047 --> 00:47:19.591
...Omar will return where
Omar belongs.


422
00:47:20.634 --> 00:47:22.427
I'm not interested in politics.

423
00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:24.221
It doesn't feed you bread...

424
00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:30.352
Double the cash...

425
00:47:30.644 --> 00:47:32.020
...plus more diamonds...

426
00:47:32.312 --> 00:47:33.313
...if the usurper...

427
00:47:33.605 --> 00:47:37.609
...takes to his heels
and we get back Boulounga.


428
00:47:40.696 --> 00:47:42.114
When, how and where?

429
00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:45.367
Tuesday, 27th, one of your men.
Just one...


430
00:47:45.659 --> 00:47:49.288
...will be at the station
at 14.45 with the samples.


431
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.916
He'll buy a ticket for
Crecy-la-Chapelle and leave...


432
00:47:53.208 --> 00:47:54.334
...with a deposit...

433
00:47:54.626 --> 00:47:55.711
...of 30% Cash...

434
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:58.297
...dollars and cents.

435
00:48:01.508 --> 00:48:04.303
Well?
The operator's transferring me.


436
00:48:04.595 --> 00:48:07.472
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga in person.


437
00:48:07.764 --> 00:48:10.392
So you thought?
Ha! Ha!


438
00:48:10.684 --> 00:48:13.186
Congratulations, you're now looking
at noon to 2pm.


439
00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:15.981
I didn't invent sliced bread...

440
00:48:16.273 --> 00:48:19.151
...but I don't mistake candles
for lanterns.


441
00:48:19.443 --> 00:48:21.820
Well, I want one man
present...


442
00:48:22.112 --> 00:48:25.324
... with samples at the Eastern
railway station tomorrow at 14:45.


443
00:48:25.615 --> 00:48:29.077
He'll get a ticket
for La Ferte-Milon.


444
00:48:29.369 --> 00:48:32.914
He'll leave with the 1st
installment of the order. ok?


445
00:48:33.206 --> 00:48:34.374
Right. Ok!

446
00:48:39.129 --> 00:48:41.214
Ready for more, guys?

447
00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:43.633
Why "guys"?

448
00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:49.931
Well, because there'll be action.

449
00:48:50.223 --> 00:48:53.226
Ah! When there's action, it's not for girls?

450
00:48:55.729 --> 00:48:56.563
Preconception...

451
00:48:56.855 --> 00:48:58.356
Uh...

452
00:49:00.358 --> 00:49:01.902
You're not a real...

453
00:49:02.778 --> 00:49:03.862
Real what?

454
00:49:06.031 --> 00:49:08.408
A real girl! Is that it?

455
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.951
I wouldn't say that.

456
00:49:10.243 --> 00:49:11.244
If that's it.

457
00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:14.247
No.
Is it! Is that what you wanted to say.


458
00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:15.498
No.

459
00:49:15.499 --> 00:49:19.878
Did you mean I'm a 'Tomboy'?

460
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.630
That's right.

461
00:49:21.922 --> 00:49:25.926
When I have to fold into a bag,
I'm in the club!


462
00:49:50.408 --> 00:49:53.328
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
arms traffickers...</i>


463
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.498
<i>...currently waiting in the station.</i>

464
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.375
<i>Be vigilant.</i>

465
00:49:59.209 --> 00:50:03.088
<i>Don't buy a land mine from
a dealer on the run.</i>


466
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.008
<i>You risk him using it.</i>

467
00:50:07.968 --> 00:50:09.803
<i>Thank you for your attention.</i>

468
00:50:39.541 --> 00:50:42.836
Wow! What's that?

469
00:50:43.128 --> 00:50:46.423
1 kg 720 steel,

470
00:50:46.715 --> 00:50:48.383
...70 grammes of kevlar.

471
00:50:51.886 --> 00:50:54.222
And that's not a small Uzi is it?

472
00:50:54.514 --> 00:50:57.350
It's a MAC 10, maybe even 11.

473
00:50:57.642 --> 00:50:59.227
No, no!

474
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.480
You step on it
and it'll take your foot!

475
00:51:02.772 --> 00:51:03.656
Oh...

476
00:51:04.149 --> 00:51:05.734
Or your life, perhaps.

477
00:51:15.827 --> 00:51:17.120
Hold there!

478
00:51:17.412 --> 00:51:19.789
That's for recycling!
It's not for us.


479
00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:23.043
I didn't recycle it,
it fell off the back of a tank!


480
00:51:23.335 --> 00:51:24.502
Confiscated!

481
00:51:25.045 --> 00:51:26.838
It's a nasty game!

482
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.799
If you want to be
Al Capone, go to Chicago!

483
00:51:30.091 --> 00:51:30.967
Ah... if I wasn't here...

484
00:51:31.259 --> 00:51:34.721
Ready for Phase 2?
Strike while the iron is hot!


485
00:51:35.013 --> 00:51:37.349
Let's draw!

486
00:51:38.224 --> 00:51:40.226
De Fenouillet, here's Boulounga.

487
00:51:40.518 --> 00:51:42.771
Your man didn't turn up!

488
00:51:43.063 --> 00:51:46.733
The deal is obsolete.
Vigilante Armament offered me better.


489
00:51:47.025 --> 00:51:51.404
Make a cross on the diamonds and
butter in the spinach.


490
00:52:18.556 --> 00:52:20.266
Marconi Boulounga for Omar.

491
00:52:20.558 --> 00:52:22.894
If you could do
it a bit more sober.

492
00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:25.355
Marconi? Boulounga is pissed!

493
00:52:25.647 --> 00:52:28.858
Your boy took to his heels.

494
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.735
The deal is dead and gone.

495
00:52:31.027 --> 00:52:35.448
Aubervilliers Armaments are
better customers. Goodbye!


496
00:53:31.671 --> 00:53:33.882
Tambouille,
I have to go out between 1 and 2pm.


497
00:53:34.173 --> 00:53:36.009
Your 2 sharks have taken the bait?

498
00:53:36.801 --> 00:53:39.470
For now, they're biting.
I'm...


499
00:53:39.762 --> 00:53:41.055
...just going to sweeten the pot!

500
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.268
But when it bites,
it will be well hooked...

501
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.854
It's big.
Then I...


502
00:53:48.146 --> 00:53:51.816
Then 'We'...
We'll turn the screws.


503
00:53:52.525 --> 00:53:54.694
No, not until we see their faces.

504
00:53:58.239 --> 00:54:01.034
Not Gay, Gay.
Lookout!


505
00:54:01.326 --> 00:54:02.660
Lookout.

506
00:54:03.202 --> 00:54:04.912
Yes. Oh well...

507
00:54:05.204 --> 00:54:09.000
I need volunteers to go on the roofs.
Thank you, calculator.


508
00:54:09.292 --> 00:54:12.795
It's good to have people who count.

509
00:54:13.296 --> 00:54:14.172
Good...

510
00:54:21.387 --> 00:54:23.806
Uh...where are you going then?

511
00:54:24.098 --> 00:54:25.642
Well, wherever you go.

512
00:54:26.643 --> 00:54:30.021
Excuse me,
but I must handle a delicate matter.


513
00:54:30.313 --> 00:54:31.939
I prefer to go alone.

514
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.068
Ah, I understand.

515
00:54:35.652 --> 00:54:38.363
It's true that in matters of delicacy...

516
00:54:38.655 --> 00:54:41.366
...and even subtlety...

517
00:54:43.868 --> 00:54:46.037
...you're an expert.

518
00:55:03.262 --> 00:55:06.057
"The diva of porn",
she'll please you!


519
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:08.351
Something of a pencil sharpener!

520
00:55:09.143 --> 00:55:12.897
Great, but do you own a nightgown.

521
00:55:13.189 --> 00:55:14.524
I sleep naked.

522
00:55:14.816 --> 00:55:16.109
Hey, Henry...

523
00:55:17.151 --> 00:55:18.194
...you spell Henri...

524
00:55:18.486 --> 00:55:20.321
...not with a Y but with an I.

525
00:55:23.866 --> 00:55:25.159
Oh? Are you sure?

526
00:55:25.451 --> 00:55:27.328
Thierry Henri?
Yeah.


527
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.957
It would be wrong, 
Thierry Henry?

528
00:55:31.249 --> 00:55:35.420
Do not worry, I'm always game
for the Cyclops sneeze.


529
00:55:35.962 --> 00:55:38.423
Well, we'll do as you ask?
Yeah.


530
00:55:39.715 --> 00:55:41.592
Soon.
This evening.


531
00:55:48.683 --> 00:55:49.806
What?

532
00:55:50.315 --> 00:55:51.340
I thought...

533
00:55:51.352 --> 00:55:55.022
...you're fishing for shark,
not cod or herring!


534
00:55:57.233 --> 00:55:58.442
We're not married.

535
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.029
No, we're not married.

536
00:56:03.072 --> 00:56:05.908
Anyway,
perverts are not my thing.


537
00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:09.704
Mine's like...
with contortionists.


538
00:56:09.996 --> 00:56:13.249
My mother always told me
to distrust twisted...


539
00:56:14.959 --> 00:56:16.419
I am not twisted.

540
00:56:19.297 --> 00:56:22.925
I am a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.


541
00:56:23.217 --> 00:56:24.552
That's not the same

542
00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:35.438
Hello?
Listen to me.


543
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:36.689
You listen to me!

544
00:56:36.981 --> 00:56:38.107
Camel!

545
00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:40.318
I despise your shenanigans!

546
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.112
Put the Boulounga diamonds
where you like!


547
00:56:43.404 --> 00:56:47.617
You want to play the bloody idiot? You want
that I take out more teeth, fingers...


548
00:56:47.909 --> 00:56:52.496
...and bones of the Assyrian kings.
More looting of the Baghdad museum...


549
00:56:52.788 --> 00:56:55.499
If you want war,
think twice about it!


550
00:56:57.126 --> 00:56:59.211
When one is fortunate to have divorced...

551
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:02.131
...to advantage, one doesn't choose
as a mistress...


552
00:57:02.381 --> 00:57:04.675
...the wife of the Prime Minister.

553
00:57:05.301 --> 00:57:09.430
I also have the recording at home.

554
00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:20.835
Well, I gotta say...

555
00:58:21.127 --> 00:58:24.213
...that Grandpa and Grandma
did it in the dark...


556
00:58:24.505 --> 00:58:27.967
So doing it in front of everyone...

557
00:58:28.259 --> 00:58:31.595
...is just a little more dramatic...

558
00:58:31.887 --> 00:58:36.142
...a little more creative,
a little more flexible, right?


559
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.729
Bazil! Hey!

560
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:41.981
Boo!

561
00:58:45.651 --> 00:58:46.569
Oh...

562
00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:56.620
Let's go.

563
00:59:09.925 --> 00:59:14.930
There... I'm not too much girl
to act like an alley cat?


564
00:59:15.514 --> 00:59:18.767
No, precisely why we needed a person...

565
00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:19.977
Flexible!

566
00:59:20.978 --> 00:59:25.524
We needed someone like you,
feline and female.


567
01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:32.508
Oh dear...

568
01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:18.906
Marignan?

569
01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:20.949
Nagasaki?

570
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.159
Kiss?

571
01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.003
Hello, sir.

572
01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:37.633
Something happened during the night.
It's most unusual.


573
01:02:44.348 --> 01:02:45.766
Sir!

574
01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:52.564
Come on, Maurice.
"Stephen", Sir.


575
01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:13.627
I have a delivery for
Mr. De Fenouillet


576
01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:16.838
You're out of luck,
he just left.


577
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:18.382
Leave it to me.

578
01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:20.467
It's a bit heavy.

579
01:03:20.759 --> 01:03:21.510
Ah...

580
01:03:24.346 --> 01:03:25.430
Go ahead.

581
01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:32.896
There.

582
01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:13.979
7 metres, 50 centimetres, 4 millimetres.

583
01:04:45.218 --> 01:04:48.096
The same rubber

584
01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:51.099
With her, you can go crazy

585
01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.519
She'll send you funny in the head

586
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.772
It seeks the above

587
01:04:57.063 --> 01:04:59.691
And is found below

588
01:05:00.233 --> 01:05:04.821
The same rubber

589
01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:27.302
Child!

590
01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:30.514
You've washed your hands?
YES!


591
01:05:31.681 --> 01:05:32.724
Let's see.

592
01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:34.768
Hey, you!

593
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.813
There is no laughing at the table.

594
01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.568
How are you going,
with your merchants of death?


595
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:47.697
They're hooked! The more they struggle
the more their trapped.


596
01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:50.408
Oh... When I think of
those poor mothers...


597
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.328
...who lose their children
because of mines.


598
01:05:55.622 --> 01:05:57.290
You know Tambouille?

599
01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:01.670
She had 2 little girls.
One evening at the Foire du Trône...


600
01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:04.089
...she saw them enter
the labyrinth.


601
01:06:04.381 --> 01:06:06.049
She never saw them come out.

602
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:09.844
For years, she has searched
the streets.


603
01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:12.222
Eventually, she became a tramp.

604
01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:15.600
And after all that,
She adopted us.


605
01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:16.977
Fifififi...

606
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:19.479
Enough, my lowly masses.

607
01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:22.357
What can you see my
little salty?


608
01:06:22.649 --> 01:06:25.277
Fats: 62%, proteins: 4%...
OH!


609
01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:26.444
Ben who?

610
01:06:26.736 --> 01:06:29.364
A little salty is as it should be...

611
01:06:29.614 --> 01:06:32.325
...a black belt
at Cordon Bleu.


612
01:06:32.617 --> 01:06:34.119
Oh, surely not...

613
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:36.454
Even if...oh no.

614
01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:39.499
You've got an idea for cooking
your 2 big fish?


615
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:42.794
Frying.
There's more to roll in flour.


616
01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:45.755
In the flour!

617
01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:26.504
Fracasse, you sure?
No! He's okay.


618
01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:35.722
Go! We we will do Fracasse's final checks!

619
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.151
Calculator!

620
01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:49.861
Distance: 138 meters.

621
01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:52.781
Wind Speed: 12 km/h,
Direction South/SouthWest.


622
01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:54.574
There.
Weight of the projectile?


623
01:07:54.866 --> 01:07:56.242
76 kilos.

624
01:07:56.534 --> 01:07:59.204
Add 4.
It's Tambouilles fault.


625
01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:00.914
OK...say 80.

626
01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:02.624
Why did you add more?

627
01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:06.377
Slice: 70 grammes.
Butter: 37 g. Jam...


628
01:08:06.669 --> 01:08:08.755
Okay, okay!
Come on, get ready.


629
01:08:18.139 --> 01:08:19.474
Remington!

630
01:08:20.433 --> 01:08:22.310
For the committees approval!

631
01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:24.646
Engine!

632
01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:32.403
It's time to go.

633
01:08:32.695 --> 01:08:35.573
No, it's too early. 59...

634
01:08:37.534 --> 01:08:39.035
58...

635
01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:40.703
57...

636
01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:42.789
56...

637
01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.251
55 seconds.

638
01:08:46.543 --> 01:08:47.544
Oh!

639
01:08:57.387 --> 01:08:58.638
Closet, what happened?

640
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:03.268
What? It's recycled!
It's old...


641
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.435
Oh!

642
01:09:17.824 --> 01:09:18.825
Closet!

643
01:09:19.742 --> 01:09:21.744
You Bastard!

644
01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:24.289
But it's recycled!

645
01:10:18.801 --> 01:10:19.719
Fire!

646
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.631
Watchout!

647
01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:46.472
Come on, move!

648
01:11:51.769 --> 01:11:52.520
Watchout!!

649
01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:21.674
No batteries?!
How?!


650
01:12:21.966 --> 01:12:23.968
It's recycled.
It's recycled?


651
01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:27.638
I broke the altitude record!
And I had proof!


652
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:29.056
One Minute, butterfly!

653
01:12:29.348 --> 01:12:30.182
What?

654
01:12:30.474 --> 01:12:34.937
I devoted myself to the the filming!
That's the last straw!


655
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:36.939
No Battery!

656
01:12:40.776 --> 01:12:43.696
It's an unwritten law:
One key to the equipment.


657
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.281
It's going to explode.

658
01:12:45.573 --> 01:12:48.659
It's her.
Code 5, no quarter.


659
01:12:53.622 --> 01:12:56.584
You are Madame Cisse?
Yes.


660
01:12:56.876 --> 01:12:58.419
Your husband has a problem.

661
01:12:59.086 --> 01:13:01.088
What happened?

662
01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:05.301
Your husband is ashamed:
He lost your residency permit.


663
01:13:06.093 --> 01:13:07.803
Then I only have to request a duplicate.

664
01:13:08.095 --> 01:13:11.474
That's what I organised with
Edward Mangin...


665
01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:13.726
... my friend the Prefect of Police.

666
01:13:14.018 --> 01:13:15.728
But your record as not been found.

667
01:13:16.437 --> 01:13:18.564
But I assure you...

668
01:13:18.856 --> 01:13:20.191
Why have you done this?

669
01:13:21.609 --> 01:13:22.526
Who are you?

670
01:13:23.819 --> 01:13:26.739
I'm part of the company that
employs your husband.


671
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:29.492
You see, our activities relate to...

672
01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:31.327
...national defense.

673
01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:33.037
At the same time, obviously...

674
01:13:33.329 --> 01:13:36.040
...we feel obliged to protect children...

675
01:13:36.332 --> 01:13:40.336
I always try to put pressure on
my friend Mangin


676
01:13:40.628 --> 01:13:42.797
That's good,
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.


677
01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:45.049
I know, you know what?

678
01:13:47.802 --> 01:13:48.844
Show him.

679
01:13:50.262 --> 01:13:52.598
In Naval shipyards,
they have the same machine.


680
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:54.475
You see where it is?

681
01:13:54.767 --> 01:13:56.894
It's essential, it must be installed with...

682
01:13:57.186 --> 01:13:59.814
...the bulkhead opening on the outside...

683
01:14:00.064 --> 01:14:01.148
...like that.

684
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.693
This has been done
to guide the air out...

685
01:14:04.985 --> 01:14:06.487
...in case of...

686
01:14:06.779 --> 01:14:11.200
...the technician activating the machine
from behind the door...


687
01:14:11.492 --> 01:14:13.536
Ideally we would proceed...

688
01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:17.164
...during lunch, when the machine is paused.

689
01:14:17.456 --> 01:14:19.333
What should I do?
Almost nothing.


690
01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:23.921
You unscrew the small tube here,
you slide the steel ball out...


691
01:14:24.213 --> 01:14:26.423
...and that's all.

692
01:14:28.008 --> 01:14:29.385
It's dangerous?

693
01:14:29.677 --> 01:14:31.971
Returning to Somalia...
is dangerous too.


694
01:14:32.638 --> 01:14:34.682
I put it where?
Ah!


695
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:39.436
Do not bother to clean the
dust underneath.


696
01:15:12.428 --> 01:15:14.513
Do you have a minute?

697
01:15:17.933 --> 01:15:20.728
It's forbidden to park here
with this load.


698
01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.188
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

699
01:16:16.658 --> 01:16:18.452
By God!

700
01:16:43.519 --> 01:16:46.230
That's strange.
Usually, he warns me.


701
01:16:46.522 --> 01:16:49.525
In the time of his father,
you would not have come.


702
01:16:51.443 --> 01:16:52.736
There's nothing to sign?
No.


703
01:16:53.028 --> 01:16:54.154
Thank you very much.

704
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:09.086
Bazil, this blackmail evidence, what is it?

705
01:17:09.378 --> 01:17:11.213
It may be a video...

706
01:17:11.505 --> 01:17:14.383
...tape, envelopes,
photos...


707
01:17:14.675 --> 01:17:16.885
It can be anything
and anywhere.


708
01:17:17.803 --> 01:17:19.012
Thank's for the clarification.

709
01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.223
it's somewhere there.

710
01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:24.643
That slab...

711
01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:35.028
Where's this package?

712
01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.781
I understand, it was there.

713
01:17:38.073 --> 01:17:39.616
The nanny has put it away?

714
01:17:39.908 --> 01:17:42.286
No, your son is with his mother.

715
01:17:42.578 --> 01:17:44.621
His mother...
Ah yes, true.


716
01:17:44.913 --> 01:17:46.498
Get me the package.

717
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:49.835
I assure you...
Just go.


718
01:17:52.129 --> 01:17:53.797
Oh, this'll be sweet...

719
01:18:01.471 --> 01:18:03.891
<i>this afternoon in the
Naval shipyards of Aubervilliers...</i>


720
01:18:04.182 --> 01:18:06.393
<i>...it did extensive damage.</i>

721
01:18:06.685 --> 01:18:08.562
<i>No casualties were reported.</i>

722
01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:11.899
<i>An investigation is underway
to determine the cause.</i>


723
01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:15.777
<i>...recall the CEO
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...</i>


724
01:18:16.069 --> 01:18:19.031
<i>...has been cited in cases of
influencing the deal...</i>


725
01:18:19.323 --> 01:18:22.117
<i>...but he's not been replaced at this time.</i>

726
01:18:22.409 --> 01:18:24.453
<i>- I defy anyone to make...
- Rubbish.</i>


727
01:18:24.745 --> 01:18:26.413
<i>...no tangible evidence!*</i>

728
01:18:26.705 --> 01:18:28.749
<i>It's a scandal!</i>

729
01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:30.751
<i>Ongoing information on LCI.</i>

730
01:18:50.395 --> 01:18:53.023
Calm, calm...Breath.

731
01:18:55.942 --> 01:18:59.237
Practice:
The key issues.


732
01:18:59.529 --> 01:19:01.073
Number 12: Who...

733
01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:03.617
...invents jokes?

734
01:19:03.909 --> 01:19:07.913
No. 27: Why is the place we seek on a
map always in the fold?


735
01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:11.708
No. 62:
How much erosion is caused by walking?


736
01:19:16.463 --> 01:19:19.091
<i>The CEO,
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...</i>


737
01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:22.677
<i>...has been cited with charges
of influencing the sales...</i>


738
01:19:22.969 --> 01:19:25.055
<i>...and has been fired.</i>

739
01:19:26.473 --> 01:19:27.599
Ah! Rubbish!

740
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:29.267
<i>...no tangible evidence!</i>

741
01:19:29.559 --> 01:19:30.310
<i>It's a setup.</i>

742
01:19:30.602 --> 01:19:32.979
<i>Ongoing information on LCI.</i>

743
01:19:39.903 --> 01:19:41.905
So you want war?

744
01:19:42.197 --> 01:19:44.116
Well it will be a Blitzkrieg!

745
01:19:44.408 --> 01:19:45.909
Sir, we have to go?

746
01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:47.411
Go!

747
01:19:47.994 --> 01:19:49.746
Go.
Go.


748
01:19:50.288 --> 01:19:51.498
Go!

749
01:20:29.202 --> 01:20:30.495
Ah! What now!...

750
01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:52.267
That's it then?

751
01:20:53.977 --> 01:20:57.063
You thought we'd rot in prison?

752
01:20:57.689 --> 01:21:00.609
You're impressed by our resolve?

753
01:21:11.578 --> 01:21:13.204
Exercise # 8: Money...

754
01:21:13.496 --> 01:21:16.541
Dough, cash, money, moola, wonga,
lucre, grease...


755
01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:19.544
...dosh, pennies!

756
01:21:35.852 --> 01:21:36.895
Yeah!

757
01:22:08.093 --> 01:22:09.010
No!

758
01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:12.806
Tut tut tut...Hush.

759
01:22:14.891 --> 01:22:15.975
Oh...

760
01:22:52.053 --> 01:22:53.221
Oh! No!

761
01:23:01.813 --> 01:23:04.524
I came to teach you a little lesson...

762
01:23:04.816 --> 01:23:09.070
...but these clowns gave me another idea.

763
01:23:12.282 --> 01:23:13.867
Oh no...

764
01:23:15.452 --> 01:23:16.578
How?

765
01:23:19.581 --> 01:23:21.541
You'd never take such a risk.

766
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.835
What risk?

767
01:23:25.336 --> 01:23:30.341
You refused to sell arms to rebels
who were formenting a coup.


768
01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:33.178
They planted a bomb in the
Naval shipyards...


769
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:35.638
...before coming to attack you!

770
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:38.683
We rushed to your aid...

771
01:23:39.684 --> 01:23:40.935
Isn't that so, Libarski?

772
01:23:41.227 --> 01:23:43.146
We arrived a bit too late.

773
01:23:44.772 --> 01:23:46.232
This is perfect.

774
01:23:46.524 --> 01:23:47.817
Wait, wait...

775
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:07.503
Ah!

776
01:24:07.795 --> 01:24:10.298
I'll give you the tape with the evidence.

777
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:13.343
The teeth, the fingers,
the looting of Baghdad Museum.


778
01:24:13.635 --> 01:24:16.095
You take it and you leave.

779
01:24:18.973 --> 01:24:20.433
It's not enough.

780
01:24:20.725 --> 01:24:23.686
Oh, okay,
stop your bullshit!


781
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:28.816
Ok,
I would not have sabotaged your plant.


782
01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:30.777
But you stole my shells.

783
01:24:32.278 --> 01:24:33.196
What shells?

784
01:24:34.072 --> 01:24:35.490
Well...

785
01:24:36.157 --> 01:24:37.700
...the ammo truck.

786
01:24:38.826 --> 01:24:40.954
You stole an amunition truck.

787
01:24:41.245 --> 01:24:42.914
We did what?
No.


788
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:44.916
It wasn't us.

789
01:24:46.376 --> 01:24:47.752
The truck, wasn't me.

790
01:24:48.044 --> 01:24:50.546
It was probably them.

791
01:24:51.714 --> 01:24:54.342
Yes, it must be them.

792
01:24:54.801 --> 01:24:57.261
Him...it's him!

793
01:24:57.553 --> 01:25:00.390
He was spotted in the video!

794
01:25:00.682 --> 01:25:02.225
He was disguised as a server!

795
01:25:02.517 --> 01:25:04.644
I thought he worked for you.

796
01:25:04.936 --> 01:25:06.312
I thought he worked for you...

797
01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:07.939
...dirty trick number 2.

798
01:25:08.231 --> 01:25:11.359
What madness!
Who do you work for?


799
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:15.488
Er...I'm on my own.

800
01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:19.033
I have a bachelor flat.

801
01:25:19.325 --> 01:25:20.910
We'll question him there?

802
01:25:21.202 --> 01:25:22.954
My car is outside.

803
01:25:23.246 --> 01:25:24.872
I'm not too early!

804
01:25:25.164 --> 01:25:28.000
You're late.
The problem is over.


805
01:25:28.835 --> 01:25:29.711
That's him.

806
01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:33.256
Oh...

807
01:25:34.132 --> 01:25:36.426
Aeschylus died after...

808
01:25:36.718 --> 01:25:38.302
...a turtle hit him in the head.

809
01:25:38.594 --> 01:25:43.015
Jean-Baptiste Lully,
died of gangrene.


810
01:25:43.307 --> 01:25:47.645
Barbarossa drowned by forgetting to remove
his armor to cross a river.


811
01:25:47.937 --> 01:25:52.775
And me, I'm dying stupidly too,
feeling like a jerk.


812
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:37.403
Closet, Plan B.

813
01:26:37.695 --> 01:26:42.783
E-m-e-r-g-e-n-c-y!

814
01:28:02.113 --> 01:28:04.740
Everyone out!
Ha! Ha! Ha!


815
01:28:18.963 --> 01:28:20.423
Hop on!

816
01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:30.391
240, 230...

817
01:28:30.683 --> 01:28:32.518
...220, 210...

818
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:37.773
...200, 190, 180, 170...

819
01:28:38.065 --> 01:28:40.484
...160, 150...

820
01:28:42.653 --> 01:28:44.321
...130, 120...

821
01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:47.158
...110, 90, 70...

822
01:28:49.201 --> 01:28:51.162
And...and...and...now!

823
01:28:51.454 --> 01:28:52.913
Dump the trash!

824
01:29:02.757 --> 01:29:03.841
Slowly.

825
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:19.648
Oh shit...

826
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.734
Garbage pick-up!

827
01:29:56.936 --> 01:29:58.646
They're over us...
on the bridge!


828
01:29:58.938 --> 01:30:01.899
The carrots are cooked,
and you've drawn a blank!


829
01:30:03.817 --> 01:30:05.402
Hope you enjoy the sun.

830
01:30:05.694 --> 01:30:08.030
We're paying for your vacation
to North Africa.


831
01:30:16.288 --> 01:30:18.958
Closet, good landing, thank you

832
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:22.002
He! He! It's...
RECYCLED'!!!


833
01:30:39.019 --> 01:30:40.020
Again!

834
01:30:42.773 --> 01:30:43.816
Again!

835
01:31:31.655 --> 01:31:32.948
You recognise this?

836
01:31:50.132 --> 01:31:53.343
And you, recognise this?

837
01:32:07.733 --> 01:32:10.778
Shhh! Tut tut tut...

838
01:32:11.069 --> 01:32:12.446
Don't move.

839
01:32:13.906 --> 01:32:14.948
Don't move.

840
01:32:30.839 --> 01:32:32.508
You want a ransom?

841
01:32:35.594 --> 01:32:38.096
Demand a price...
we can afford it.


842
01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:41.391
I'm Friends...

843
01:32:41.683 --> 01:32:43.602
...with the President of the Republic.

844
01:32:43.894 --> 01:32:47.189
Take away this grenade, it's ridiculous!

845
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:51.443
We'll call,
you'll see, he will pay


846
01:32:51.735 --> 01:32:53.153
Articulate, idiot!

847
01:32:58.575 --> 01:32:59.785
What do you want?

848
01:33:02.955 --> 01:33:04.915
Sorry...

849
01:33:05.207 --> 01:33:07.251
...for the kids.

850
01:33:09.294 --> 01:33:12.214
Ah yes...
Sorry.


851
01:33:12.506 --> 01:33:13.966
Apologies to the women...

852
01:33:14.258 --> 01:33:16.426
...who are raped
in the wars!


853
01:33:16.718 --> 01:33:20.138
I sell weapons to people
who stop wars.


854
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:21.473
You bastard!

855
01:33:21.765 --> 01:33:24.101
You still sell
Landmines!


856
01:33:29.273 --> 01:33:31.984
I'm for terrorism.
Me too.


857
01:33:32.276 --> 01:33:34.570
The Boeing 300 who died in Ankara...

858
01:33:34.861 --> 01:33:37.322
The explosive were ours!

859
01:33:37.614 --> 01:33:40.576
You were using, 
I was providing...

860
01:33:40.867 --> 01:33:42.452
...ETA and the IRA.

861
01:33:42.744 --> 01:33:46.498
And Darfur, where do you think
they get their explosives from?


862
01:33:47.165 --> 01:33:49.334
You encouraged the markets?

863
01:33:49.626 --> 01:33:51.628
Kind of pathetic!

864
01:37:03.737 --> 01:37:06.740
Video traffickers

865
01:37:19.961 --> 01:37:22.047
Go to YouTube...

866
01:37:22.339 --> 01:37:25.050
...and type
"arms dealers caught".


867
01:37:46.738 --> 01:37:49.115
Guys, come see.

868
01:37:57.832 --> 01:37:59.709
Mr. Marconi, please!

869
01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:02.462
The price of your shares collapsed.

870
01:38:02.754 --> 01:38:06.424
You may serve 15 years.
What's your defense?


871
01:38:06.716 --> 01:38:08.676
We can send you a YouTube link...

872
01:38:11.596 --> 01:38:15.100
Fenouillet dropped by his former
political friends...


873
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:18.019
...by the President himself...

874
01:38:18.269 --> 01:38:20.563
...has fled to an unknown location...

875
01:38:20.855 --> 01:38:25.693
We expect one day to see the closing
of the Naval shipyards of Aubervilliers.


876
01:38:39.999 --> 01:38:42.418
As soon as the 2 merchants of
death hit the floor...


877
01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:47.006
...Bazil, proud as Lucifer,
beat his breast and made amends...


878
01:38:51.511 --> 01:38:53.972
There's no need
to be a genius...


879
01:38:54.264 --> 01:38:57.433
...to understand that they would
see with eyes of Chimene.


880
01:38:57.725 --> 01:38:59.310
And it was no secret...

881
01:38:59.602 --> 01:39:02.272
...they get along like a house on fire.
