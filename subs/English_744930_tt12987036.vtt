2
00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.157
One more thing before we get
into your next assignments.


3
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.867
The results for
the international


4
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:39.943
travel writer's awards are in.

5
00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.981
Congratulations, Caroline.

6
00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:44.262
Honestly, this is a team win.

7
00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:45.728
We all share this.

8
00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:48.498
Actually, it's a team
third place win.


9
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.559
Third place?

10
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.106
Yep. It happens.

11
00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.545
Now, I know you're all waiting
for your next assignments.


12
00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.110
We can't be a travel magazine
without you travelling,


13
00:00:56.194 --> 00:01:02.792
so Greece, Sao Paulo,
Bali, Nashville.


14
00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:03.853
You stay.

15
00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:08.944
I have a plum assignment
for you.


16
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.899
Carta de Amor.

17
00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:12.366
Carta de what?

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.239
Carta de Amor.

19
00:01:14.323 --> 00:01:17.011
Yes. The Spanish Riviera.

20
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:18.064
I like that.

21
00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.368
Tapas, beaches.

22
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:20.832
I can do a lot with that.

23
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:24.296
I know you can, but it's not
on the Spanish Riviera.


24
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:25.477
Brazil.

25
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.964
I'm gonna have to buy
a new swimsuit.


26
00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.919
If you're done guessing,
it's in rural New Mexico.


27
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.138
Really?

28
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:32.931
Population: 2,500.

29
00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:34.154
People?

30
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:35.498
Usually.

31
00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:37.228
Is this because I took
third place?


32
00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:39.776
No. Listen, you're
a terrific writer.


33
00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.178
This is the kind of story
you need right now.


34
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.883
Human, sweet.

35
00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:47.428
The 100th anniversary of the
Carta de Amor Christmas Parade.


36
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.872
You've never asked me to do
a Christmas story before.


37
00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.176
For good reason.

38
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.521
You don't celebrate it.

39
00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:53.865
I don't have the time.

40
00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:55.229
I have winter travel stories
to do.


41
00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:56.433
Stories you send me on.

42
00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.714
OK, I can take the blame
for that.


43
00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.872
Look, you are a terrific
travel writer.


44
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.560
You have this ability to be able
to drop in on a place


45
00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:04.905
and zone in on the thing

46
00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:07.512
that makes it special to
the person reading about it.


47
00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:11.906
But then, when you leave,
you leave it behind.


48
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.210
Isn't that the job?

49
00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:15.492
You not taking your experiences
on as a whole


50
00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.081
to the next place you go?

51
00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:19.239
It's beginning to show
in your writing.


52
00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:20.867
Something's missing.

53
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.962
That's where third place
comes in.


54
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.756
I don't know what to say.

55
00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.160
Say you'll go to New Mexico.

56
00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:30.726
I don't get back as often
as I should.


57
00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.169
The other shoe drops.

58
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.671
This sounds more like a story

59
00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:36.321
that you could do better
than me.


60
00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.141
You get to go home
and you love Christmas.


61
00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:41.027
I have commitments or I would,
trust me.


62
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.124
I want you to go there and spend
a week on the ground.


63
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.794
That's a long parade.

64
00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:48.850
I wanna push this blog as
the "Twelve Posts of Christmas".


65
00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:50.091
You space them out how you need,

66
00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:52.596
just end at Christmas day
with the parade.


67
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.185
A yule blog?

68
00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:55.246
Exactly!

69
00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.784
See? I knew you'd get
into the spirit.


70
00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:01.066
I want you to discover
the magic of Christmas there


71
00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.572
and hold onto it.

72
00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:04.323
It'll be good for
all of your writing.


73
00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:06.116
Do you trust me on this?

74
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.724
Of course I do.

75
00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:41.502
Hey.

76
00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.093
Are you UBER?

77
00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.721
No, I'm Oscar.

78
00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:48.871
Are you my ride?

79
00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:54.452
Are there any taxis?

80
00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:59.911
Not since Orlando's
horses retired.


81
00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:02.271
Is there anyone I can call
to get a ride?


82
00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.188
Yeah, absolutely.

83
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:12.084
It's 505-555-0184.

84
00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:18.522
Hello, can I help you?

85
00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:20.680
OK, very funny.

86
00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:23.329
I need to get to the Carta
de Amor Bed and Breakfast.


87
00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.813
Could you just point me
in the right direction?


88
00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:27.626
Well, if you're staying
in town overnight


89
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.969
that is the place to be.

90
00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:32.943
And I'm guessing
you're Caroline.


91
00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.551
So you are here waiting for me.

92
00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:35.713
Yeah.

93
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.240
My cousin Camilla asked me
to pick you up


94
00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:39.136
and show you the town.

95
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.738
Take you to the B&B.

96
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:44.793
I'm Oscar Ortiz.

97
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.863
Can I ask why we had to go
through all that?


98
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:53.426
Why couldn't you just tell me
you were my ride?


99
00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.505
What fun would that be?

100
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.617
You can put that on the floor
if you want.


101
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.206
Probably a lot more comfortable
for you.


102
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.654
That's OK.

103
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.097
I heard it wasn't that big
of a town.


104
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:26.012
It's huge to a lot of people.

105
00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:29.517
Families are here, their lives.

106
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.199
I meant in physical size.

107
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:34.683
I know what you meant.

108
00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:43.115
So this street that we're on
is the main parade route.


109
00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:44.581
That's why you're here, right?

110
00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.455
Yes sir, it is.

111
00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.044
Must be some kind of parade.

112
00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:49.388
Oh yeah.

113
00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:51.241
It's the best parade
you'll ever experience.


114
00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:53.156
And it's the 100th anniversary
this year.


115
00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:56.516
<i>The Christmas tree will be there
in a couple days.</i>


116
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.350
That's also a pretty big deal.

117
00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.183
That might make
a good blog post.


118
00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:02.852
Sure, I guess.

119
00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.583
I like to think it's more
than that.


120
00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:07.129
It reminds me of the small town
I grew up in.


121
00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:09.576
Everybody knows what
everybody else is doing.


122
00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.467
You say that like
it's a bad thing.


123
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.647
I like to think it's better

124
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:16.296
than it being so big
that nobody cares.


125
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.393
You might want to see a bit more
of the world


126
00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:19.841
before you make that judgement.

127
00:06:19.924 --> 00:06:21.791
Does L.A. count?

128
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.909
I was there for 10 years.

129
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:24.886
L.A.?

130
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.353
<i>Yeah.</i>

131
00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:29.000
Why would you come back here,
if you don't mind me asking?


132
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:30.426
My son.

133
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.382
Stability.

134
00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.396
The fact that everyone knows
what everyone else is doing.


135
00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.447
We just passed our school there.

136
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:43.624
We draw from two towns nearby.

137
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.091
How old is your son?

138
00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:47.162
Sean is 12.

139
00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:50.411
<i>Here we are.</i>

140
00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:53.667
<i>Carta de Amor bed and breakfast.</i>

141
00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:08.821
Thank you.

142
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.328
You're welcome.

143
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.930
One thing.

144
00:07:13.013 --> 00:07:15.252
You're gonna meet
mama and Mr. C.


145
00:07:15.294 --> 00:07:16.718
This is their place.

146
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.571
It has been for as long as
anyone can remember.


147
00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:26.209
Mr. C bears a striking
resemblance to... you'll see.


148
00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.041
We all kind of ignore it.

149
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:30.730
I've met my share of celebrities
in my line of work.


150
00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:32.402
It'll be fine.

151
00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:33.664
Great.

152
00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:41.643
<i>And just so you know,
everyone calls Mrs. C. "Mama".</i>


153
00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:42.948
Oscar!

154
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:44.249
Mama.

155
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.554
Camilla's guest is here.

156
00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:46.736
Miss Williams.

157
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.324
Welcome to Carta de Amor.

158
00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:50.443
You must be tired
after your trip.


159
00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.362
Can I get you something
to drink or eat?


160
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.539
I would love some coffee.

161
00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:54.882
White chocolate mocha?

162
00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:58.264
We just have regular
coffee here.


163
00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.057
Yeah, that works, too.
Thanks.


164
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.519
Come on in.

165
00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:16.819
Pretty amazing, huh?

166
00:08:16.902 --> 00:08:19.140
The rooms are just as nice.

167
00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:20.894
Here you go.

168
00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:22.196
Thank you.

169
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.684
Do you mind if I take
some pictures in here?


170
00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:25.782
Of course, dear.
As many as you need.


171
00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:27.527
I don't have any signal.

172
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:29.360
Is there no cell service here?

173
00:08:29.404 --> 00:08:31.521
This area of town is kinda iffy.

174
00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:33.802
They're gonna fix it
first of the year, I think.


175
00:08:33.844 --> 00:08:35.553
Not very comforting.

176
00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:36.816
Is there any WiFi?

177
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:37.875
<i>No.</i>

178
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.300
No TV's, either.

179
00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:42.886
It's a quiet, reflective place
to relax, think.


180
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.230
To recharge.

181
00:08:44.313 --> 00:08:47.286
What good is recharging
without a signal?


182
00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:52.373
She means recharge yourself.

183
00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:56.853
So no cell service, no Internet,
no WiFi.


184
00:08:56.938 --> 00:08:58.542
Is there anywhere else in town
that has it?


185
00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.364
I really need it to post
to my blog.


186
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.925
I think you'll find everything
you need here and more.


187
00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:03.862
Thank you.

188
00:09:03.946 --> 00:09:05.650
It's just for my work.

189
00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:08.544
Our guest has arrived.

190
00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:12.984
Told you.

191
00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:15.040
We are so glad that you've come
to be with us


192
00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:17.500
to celebrate Carta de Amor
Christmas.


193
00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:19.863
Mama, we need to get
those decorations up.


194
00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:22.064
Don't you worry, papa,
we're doing that this weekend.


195
00:09:22.147 --> 00:09:23.327
Tree and all.

196
00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:24.853
Sean and I will be here
to help, too.


197
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.238
Sean has been a really good boy
this year.


198
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:29.110
That he has, Mr. C.

199
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.708
<i>I'm glad you noticed.</i>

200
00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:34.353
Well, I leave you in their
more than capable hands.


201
00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:36.184
WiFi?
I really do need it.


202
00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:37.408
You'll be fine.

203
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:39.606
There's WiFi down the street
at the school.


204
00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:41.197
And at the diner.

205
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.900
And at my house, actually.

206
00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:45.181
And you're welcome to use
any of those.


207
00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:46.444
Thank you.

208
00:09:46.488 --> 00:09:47.830
That's a relief.

209
00:09:47.913 --> 00:09:53.208
And I will give you a WiFi tour
once you're settled.


210
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:55.121
<i>Mama will give me a call.</i>

211
00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:56.912
Thank you.

212
00:09:56.956 --> 00:09:58.135
OK.

213
00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:00.010
I'll see you in a bit.

214
00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:05.428
Can we get you some
milk and cookies?


215
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:07.743
You know what?
I would love some.


216
00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:24.515
OK.

217
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.546
On the first post of Christmas,

218
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.411
welcome to Carta de Amor,
New Mexico.


219
00:10:32.454 --> 00:10:34.162
It's not the Spanish Riviera,

220
00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:36.852
the kind of place you're used
to me posting from.


221
00:10:36.894 --> 00:10:39.948
I'm staying at a well-appointed
adobe style home,


222
00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:41.677
which actually looks
a bit out of place


223
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:44.306
in this small town of 2,500.

224
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.790
They tell me that Christmas
is really big here.


225
00:10:46.873 --> 00:10:51.190
I guess we'll just have
to wait and see.


226
00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:56.567
Now, I'm going to relax,
forget where I am,


227
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.924
sink into this bed,

228
00:10:59.007 --> 00:11:02.713
and dream about the sun-drenched
beaches of Mallorca.


229
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:05.606
Yep.

230
00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:12.652
Now, to find the Internet
so I can actually post this.


231
00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:15.912
<i>I can't believe I brought
the wrong clothes.</i>


232
00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:17.379
Luckily for you

233
00:11:17.463 --> 00:11:20.190
there is a pretty nice women's
clothing store in town.


234
00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:22.995
Women come from all over
the county to shop there.


235
00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:24.258
Really?

236
00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:26.458
Yeah, it's not another planet.

237
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:27.379
Sorry.

238
00:11:27.423 --> 00:11:28.439
That's OK.

239
00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:30.477
I think I owe you an apology,
too.


240
00:11:30.518 --> 00:11:34.103
I wasn't exactly Mr. Hospitality
earlier.


241
00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:36.463
I'm willing to start
from scratch if you are.


242
00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:38.907
I'll take that deal any time.

243
00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:45.018
Hi, dad.

244
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:46.933
Hi, miss Williams.
I'm Sean Ortiz.


245
00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:48.738
I've seen all your posts
on world vista


246
00:11:48.762 --> 00:11:50.267
and I've even left comments.

247
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.142
I wanna be a writer, too.

248
00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:53.772
You're that Sean.

249
00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:55.360
I've seen every issue.

250
00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:58.048
We all read it, and I guess when
you live in a place this small


251
00:11:58.132 --> 00:11:59.841
it's our way of seeing
the world.


252
00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:02.407
Well, that's the whole idea.

253
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.668
Your dad was kind enough to let
me come here and use the WiFi.


254
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.644
You wanna hook me up?

255
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.763
Sure. Right this way.

256
00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:12.837
This is a really big deal
for him.


257
00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:16.212
He has dreams of, well,
travelling and having your job,


258
00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.638
actually, one day.

259
00:12:17.721 --> 00:12:18.697
You OK with that?

260
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.796
Absolutely.

261
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.638
It's important to follow
your dreams.


262
00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.627
I always tell him that.

263
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.394
Just have a back-up plan.

264
00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:29.288
No worries.
I get it.


265
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:30.509
Thank you.

266
00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:38.371
And there.

267
00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:40.299
I connected you to the network
and I also made it


268
00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:43.622
so that you never have to use
the password ever again.


269
00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:45.659
Thank you, Sean.

270
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.296
I don't know.

271
00:12:48.338 --> 00:12:49.926
The jury's still out.

272
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.143
Camilla told me she's not
a Christmas fan.


273
00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:56.077
Come on, mama, be nice.

274
00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:04.830
Hello, Caroline.
I'm Rita Ortiz.


275
00:13:04.914 --> 00:13:07.030
My husband and Oscar's father,
Roberto, and I


276
00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:09.595
are hoping you can stay
for dinner.


277
00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.104
Can you?

278
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.914
<i>I'd love to.</i>

279
00:13:15.954 --> 00:13:17.946
Dinner was amazing.

280
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.145
You eat like this all the time?

281
00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:21.917
Rita has a golden touch
in the kitchen.


282
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.627
Stop. It's just dinner.

283
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.600
I would have moved home
from L.A. for this, too.


284
00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:35.907
I'm sorry. I think I just
stepped in something.


285
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.676
Oscar tells us you don't have
any clothes.


286
00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:40.469
Dad!

287
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.976
What did I do?

288
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.502
Josie has a really nice store
in town, women come...


289
00:13:44.586 --> 00:13:46.188
Come from all over
to shop there.


290
00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:47.639
Your son told me.

291
00:13:47.722 --> 00:13:49.595
I could help you look around.

292
00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:52.609
And afterwards I'd love to talk
about writing.


293
00:13:52.693 --> 00:13:54.966
That'd be a big help.

294
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:05.069
You have a wonderful family,
and your son is great.


295
00:14:05.152 --> 00:14:07.022
Yeah, Sean.

296
00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:09.059
I'd be lost without him.

297
00:14:13.381 --> 00:14:15.335
You don't have lights up.

298
00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:17.144
I'm not a huge Christmas person,
but...


299
00:14:17.168 --> 00:14:18.878
We have our traditions.

300
00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:20.786
It's worth the wait.

301
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:25.064
But we were wondering...
OK, I was wondering,


302
00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:28.161
why would Camilla send someone
who isn't really into Christmas


303
00:14:28.244 --> 00:14:32.233
to cover the Christmas capital
of the world?


304
00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:33.701
The world?

305
00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:35.697
Yeah, the whole world.

306
00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:41.401
Because she can?

307
00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:52.623
Good morning, sweetheart.

308
00:14:52.707 --> 00:14:54.254
Good morning, mama.

309
00:14:54.337 --> 00:14:55.939
I would love some
of your coffee.


310
00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:58.163
I can get some coffee
for you to go,


311
00:14:58.246 --> 00:15:01.135
and we have breakfast for you,
just not here.


312
00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:03.661
- Isn't this a bed and breakfast?
- It is.


313
00:15:03.745 --> 00:15:06.004
Now, let's get you dressed and
down to the competition area.


314
00:15:06.026 --> 00:15:07.491
I am dressed.

315
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.672
Competition?

316
00:15:08.756 --> 00:15:10.112
It's where we're
serving breakfast.


317
00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:11.660
Most of the town will be there.

318
00:15:11.725 --> 00:15:14.860
Now, put your head down. I'll
try not to mess up your hair.


319
00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:18.688
Please tell me what's going on.

320
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.132
You write about
your experiences, right?


321
00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:24.270
So, do you want to experience
Carta de Amor Christmas?


322
00:15:24.353 --> 00:15:26.349
This is the kick-off.

323
00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:28.832
OK.

324
00:15:36.162 --> 00:15:37.464
What is this?

325
00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:38.931
I can't wear this.

326
00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:40.071
Of course you can.

327
00:15:40.114 --> 00:15:41.474
Now, we've got to go
or we'll be late.


328
00:15:41.498 --> 00:15:42.622
What?!

329
00:15:42.706 --> 00:15:44.334
What is going on?

330
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:47.391
Hey!

331
00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:52.725
Mr. C. Can explain
while we walk.


332
00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:53.784
Walk?

333
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.491
Well, we have to let everyone
see your poncho.


334
00:15:57.574 --> 00:15:58.590
Yeah, OK.

335
00:15:58.673 --> 00:16:00.947
Let me just grab my phone.

336
00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:11.459
Look at that!

337
00:16:12.682 --> 00:16:14.840
Many years ago we started
the Christmas season


338
00:16:14.924 --> 00:16:17.611
with a traditional
ugly sweater contest.


339
00:16:17.694 --> 00:16:21.398
Then one year Rudy Santos
wore one of these and won.


340
00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:25.350
There were protests, naturally,
but the judges ruled it legal.


341
00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:26.913
Well, that sounds pretty smart
of Rudy.


342
00:16:26.935 --> 00:16:29.092
Soon everyone figured out
they had to have a poncho


343
00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.558
to have a chance to win.

344
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:32.556
Now it's a Christmas
poncho contest.


345
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.347
We host it every year.

346
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.282
This is definitely
my second post.


347
00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:48.216
I would love some pancakes,
please.


348
00:17:02.452 --> 00:17:03.958
It is pretty hideous.

349
00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:05.914
But yours isn't too bad, either.

350
00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:08.220
Yeah, thanks.

351
00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:09.727
It's the same as last year's.

352
00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:13.149
But, unlike you,
I'm not trying to win.


353
00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.309
Here, sit down.

354
00:17:15.393 --> 00:17:17.176
I can't stay.

355
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.398
I'm on clean up.

356
00:17:18.481 --> 00:17:20.435
Thank you.

357
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.876
Enjoy your meal.

358
00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:28.580
Good morning.

359
00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:30.107
Are you enjoying your stay
at the B&B?


360
00:17:30.131 --> 00:17:31.187
I sure slept well.

361
00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:33.511
Those beds are really nice.

362
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:36.037
Mr. C., it seems
so strange that...


363
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.010
You know, Oscar is the music
teacher for the district.


364
00:17:39.052 --> 00:17:41.856
Bands, choirs, singing groups.

365
00:17:41.939 --> 00:17:43.282
Music?

366
00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:44.545
I had no idea.

367
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:45.808
What does he play?

368
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.131
If it has strings on it,
he can play it.


369
00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:50.859
He was a big deal in L.A.

370
00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:57.642
These are the best pancakes
I've ever tasted.


371
00:17:57.666 --> 00:17:59.456
It's Sam, he's amazing.

372
00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:00.719
You'll meet him.

373
00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:02.592
You were asking about Oscar.

374
00:18:02.675 --> 00:18:04.141
Oh, yes.

375
00:18:04.224 --> 00:18:06.218
Music, that's what he was doing
in L.A.?


376
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:08.372
He was a successful
studio musician.


377
00:18:08.414 --> 00:18:10.409
Albums, soundtracks.

378
00:18:10.492 --> 00:18:11.956
You're kidding.

379
00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:16.479
Why would he leave all that
to come back here?


380
00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:19.939
I'm sorry, that came out wrong.

381
00:18:20.023 --> 00:18:22.016
An honest question.

382
00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:26.784
You should ask him.

383
00:18:40.197 --> 00:18:42.151
Hi, everyone.

384
00:18:42.234 --> 00:18:45.249
For those who don't know me,
I am Betty Johnson,


385
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.569
the school district librarian.

386
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.033
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


387
00:18:50.057 --> 00:18:53.477
If you want to know anything
about Carta de Amor history


388
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.508
Betty is the be all and end all.

389
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.810
Every detail.

390
00:18:56.854 --> 00:18:57.830
Good to know.

391
00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:03.166
Thank you, Sam.

392
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.286
Do you see where
that button is...?


393
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.327
Yeah.

394
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.222
That's Sam.

395
00:19:06.306 --> 00:19:07.482
He made your breakfast.

396
00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:10.050
A master chef and without
the formal training.


397
00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:11.313
Is the restaurant in town his?

398
00:19:11.396 --> 00:19:12.453
The diner?

399
00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:14.347
Oh, no. He's the school
cafeteria cook.


400
00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:15.753
What?!

401
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.370
It's time to announce
the finalists


402
00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:22.917
for the poncho contest.

403
00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:28.905
But before we do, our favourite
music teacher, Oscar Ortiz,


404
00:19:28.949 --> 00:19:31.798
has something he wants to say.

405
00:19:33.022 --> 00:19:34.773
Thank you, Betty.

406
00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:38.031
Hi, everyone,
and Merry Christmas.


407
00:19:38.074 --> 00:19:41.045
I just wanted to thank you all
for your generous donations


408
00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:44.306
to the band uniform fund.

409
00:19:44.389 --> 00:19:47.030
But I also know that
at this time of the year


410
00:19:47.072 --> 00:19:49.962
your money needs to be spent
on your families.


411
00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:52.651
I don't want any of this
to be a hardship.


412
00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:57.537
So that's why I've decided
to suspend the money drive


413
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.900
until after the holidays.

414
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.345
That's pretty sweet.

415
00:20:06.428 --> 00:20:08.707
He's always thinking about
everybody but himself.


416
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.227
<i>And now our finalists:</i>

417
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:15.139
<i>Eddie Gonzales
and Jackie Martin!</i>


418
00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:24.672
And last, in a surprise choice,
but I saw this woman's poncho


419
00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:27.971
in the food line and it
is truly horrible,


420
00:20:28.013 --> 00:20:32.697
and the first outsider ever
to make the final three,


421
00:20:32.781 --> 00:20:34.816
Caroline Williams!

422
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.870
<i>Who? Who?</i>

423
00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:37.173
Oh, no.

424
00:20:37.257 --> 00:20:38.453
Caroline is in town
to do a story


425
00:20:38.477 --> 00:20:41.573
for Camilla Talamantes's
travel magazine.


426
00:20:41.656 --> 00:20:45.036
I know a lot of you were
disheartened by her first post


427
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:48.373
but give her a chance.

428
00:20:51.064 --> 00:20:52.895
You've been summoned.

429
00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:55.830
You can't keep
your public waiting.


430
00:21:03.198 --> 00:21:11.013
And the winner of $100, courtesy
of Carta de Amor hardware, is,


431
00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:13.422
in an upset...

432
00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.664
Caroline Williams!

433
00:21:20.349 --> 00:21:22.833
I'm just as shocked
as you all are,


434
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.562
and I thank you.

435
00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:27.593
But I think I would like
to donate my prize


436
00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:29.590
to the band uniform fund.

437
00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:38.226
Thanks.

438
00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:45.394
<i>Thank you, thank you...</i>

439
00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:55.737
Mighty good job.

440
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.714
Thank you, Betty.

441
00:21:56.797 --> 00:21:58.181
You're welcome.

442
00:21:58.265 --> 00:21:59.076
Congratulations.

443
00:21:59.159 --> 00:21:59.892
Thank you.

444
00:21:59.975 --> 00:22:00.706
Have a good evening.

445
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:01.969
You too.

446
00:22:03.357 --> 00:22:04.251
Thank you.

447
00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:06.328
I appreciate every dollar.

448
00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:08.976
Well, it seemed like
the perfect thing to do.


449
00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:10.606
And I didn't just do it

450
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.907
because everybody didn't like
my first post.


451
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.771
Well, you know, your first post
did leave a lot to be desired.


452
00:22:17.854 --> 00:22:21.070
You talked about other places
you'd rather be.


453
00:22:21.154 --> 00:22:22.170
You read it?

454
00:22:22.254 --> 00:22:23.840
Oh yeah, I read it.

455
00:22:23.882 --> 00:22:25.308
So did Sean.

456
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.215
He was... he was a little bit
disappointed, to be honest.


457
00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:30.478
That wasn't my purpose.

458
00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:32.313
I'll talk to Sean.

459
00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:33.901
No, it's OK.

460
00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:36.916
He knows that actions
speak louder than words.


461
00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:38.342
But what you might wanna do

462
00:22:38.385 --> 00:22:40.501
is try and get what
we're doing here.


463
00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:42.694
I mean, it's our Christmas
traditions that...


464
00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:44.854
that bring us together

465
00:22:44.937 --> 00:22:47.950
and make us kinda unique,
I think.


466
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.461
So who were the judges, anyway?

467
00:22:51.502 --> 00:22:53.945
Mama and Mr. C.

468
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:55.291
They cheated.

469
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:57.531
Hey, never judge the C’s.

470
00:22:57.615 --> 00:22:59.649
It's a big rule around here.

471
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:02.745
OK, I have to ask you
about them.


472
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.363
Congratulations on your win!

473
00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:09.827
Just let it go.

474
00:23:09.871 --> 00:23:12.151
They rarely get things wrong.

475
00:23:12.234 --> 00:23:13.453
Thank you.

476
00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:18.017
So I'm gonna go grab Sean
but we'll be back later


477
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.581
to decorate the B&B.

478
00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.293
You wanna help?

479
00:23:22.376 --> 00:23:24.819
I know, Christmas isn't really
your thing,


480
00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:27.100
but there might be another post.

481
00:23:27.184 --> 00:23:29.219
Get you out of here sooner.

482
00:23:29.302 --> 00:23:30.378
You're looking out for me, huh?

483
00:23:30.402 --> 00:23:31.820
Yeah.

484
00:23:31.903 --> 00:23:34.997
It'd be nice if you opened
your mind a little


485
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.360
and tried to enjoy Carta de Amor
for what it is


486
00:23:37.443 --> 00:23:40.089
instead of what it isn't.

487
00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.918
<i>On the second post of Christmas</i>

488
00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:47.463
<i>Carta de Amor gave me a
new tradition to experience.</i>


489
00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:50.071
<i>The ugly Christmas poncho.</i>

490
00:23:50.154 --> 00:23:53.369
<i>They've taken the ugly sweater
and re-spun it.</i>


491
00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:55.448
The whole town turns out
in their custom


492
00:23:55.532 --> 00:23:58.254
ugly Christmas ponchos to crown
that year's Victor.


493
00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.698
And, being a journalist
who always tries to live


494
00:24:00.781 --> 00:24:04.487
what I'm reporting, I donned
a borrowed ugly poncho


495
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.520
and actually won
this year's crown.


496
00:24:08.603 --> 00:24:11.531
Here's me, mortified.

497
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:23.977
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.


498
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.403
My pleasure.

499
00:24:25.486 --> 00:24:27.156
So what do you wanna know?

500
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.419
History.

501
00:24:28.503 --> 00:24:31.309
What makes Carta de Amor tick?

502
00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:32.818
Can we start with the parade?

503
00:24:32.902 --> 00:24:35.752
That seems to be
the biggest deal.


504
00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:37.910
Nobody actually knows
how it started.


505
00:24:37.994 --> 00:24:38.972
Really?

506
00:24:39.054 --> 00:24:40.679
Does it matter?

507
00:24:40.763 --> 00:24:43.533
This is a community
who's definition of ourselves


508
00:24:43.575 --> 00:24:45.854
is in our Christmas celebration.

509
00:24:45.898 --> 00:24:49.760
It's like we get a rebirth
every year.


510
00:24:52.083 --> 00:24:53.425
I guess I...

511
00:24:53.509 --> 00:24:56.032
Wrote a couple of blog posts
before understanding that?


512
00:24:56.116 --> 00:24:57.744
Yeah.

513
00:24:57.828 --> 00:24:59.049
I did.

514
00:24:59.132 --> 00:25:02.428
But I'm going to try to be
more receptive.


515
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:04.239
I hope I haven't worn out
my welcome.


516
00:25:04.263 --> 00:25:06.705
Christmas is all about
new starts.


517
00:25:06.749 --> 00:25:10.779
You'll find everyone here
pretty forgiving.


518
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.892
One more question.

519
00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:14.725
Where is the clothing store?

520
00:25:14.808 --> 00:25:17.420
I have nothing to wear.

521
00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:18.825
Josie's.

522
00:25:18.908 --> 00:25:21.145
Come on, I'll take you.

523
00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:29.907
That was fun.

524
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.169
It was a blast.

525
00:25:31.252 --> 00:25:32.777
I can't believe her selection
for such a small...


526
00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.568
Small town in the middle
of nowhere?


527
00:25:34.592 --> 00:25:35.570
Sorry.

528
00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:36.587
Don't be.

529
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.646
You stopped yourself.

530
00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.026
That's an improvement.

531
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.451
It is.

532
00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:42.405
And I genuinely enjoyed
your company.


533
00:25:42.449 --> 00:25:44.198
And the history lesson.

534
00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:46.115
That's what new friends
do together.


535
00:25:46.156 --> 00:25:47.743
That they do.

536
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.952
OK, let it go.

537
00:25:56.787 --> 00:25:58.864
Caroline, you're just in time.

538
00:25:58.906 --> 00:26:01.471
And you got some
new clothes, too.


539
00:26:01.512 --> 00:26:02.611
Very nice.

540
00:26:02.654 --> 00:26:03.705
Thank you.

541
00:26:03.748 --> 00:26:07.372
And since you're all here,

542
00:26:07.456 --> 00:26:12.382
I wanted to apologize for not
being all in with Carta de Amor.


543
00:26:12.425 --> 00:26:15.600
I would like another chance.

544
00:26:15.684 --> 00:26:17.068
From you, too, Sean.

545
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:19.389
Do you wanna help us decorate
the tree?


546
00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:22.770
I haven't... I haven't
decorated a tree


547
00:26:22.854 --> 00:26:23.815
since I was a kid.

548
00:26:23.898 --> 00:26:25.608
Don't you miss it?

549
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:29.677
You know, the smell of that tree
does bring back memories.


550
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.671
I love that smell.

551
00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:34.687
Well, then decorate it.

552
00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:38.435
Fulfill this plain
tree's destiny.


553
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.677
Come on.

554
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.832
OK.

555
00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:52.609
No.

556
00:26:54.424 --> 00:26:55.929
Maybe.

557
00:27:01.757 --> 00:27:02.855
Yeah.

558
00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:08.030
That felt good.

559
00:27:08.113 --> 00:27:10.962
You know what?
Let's... let's do some more.


560
00:27:18.617 --> 00:27:20.164
Way up.

561
00:27:54.867 --> 00:27:55.965
Well, you got in the spirit.

562
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.352
That wasn't hard at all, was it?

563
00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:59.306
I honestly enjoyed it.

564
00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:00.896
It's been a long time.

565
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.502
We're going to the big tree
tomorrow night.


566
00:28:03.586 --> 00:28:04.874
You could write about that.

567
00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:05.874
Big tree?

568
00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:07.094
Yeah.

569
00:28:07.177 --> 00:28:08.581
Everyone who's there hangs
an ornament on it.


570
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:09.737
Something meaningful.

571
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.978
We'll have to get you
an ornament.


572
00:28:11.002 --> 00:28:11.773
There's a shop in town...

573
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:12.711
Sean.

574
00:28:12.794 --> 00:28:13.932
No, he's right.

575
00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:16.051
My job is to participate
in what I'm covering.


576
00:28:16.134 --> 00:28:18.863
So if everyone's hanging
an ornament then I will, too.


577
00:28:18.946 --> 00:28:20.429
How about ornament shopping
with me?


578
00:28:20.453 --> 00:28:21.428
Really?

579
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:22.363
Yeah, OK!

580
00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:23.424
Great.

581
00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:24.523
<i>Caroline?</i>

582
00:28:24.606 --> 00:28:25.969
<i>Would you like some more
hot chocolate?</i>


583
00:28:25.992 --> 00:28:26.763
Last call.

584
00:28:26.846 --> 00:28:28.393
Yes, please.

585
00:28:28.477 --> 00:28:30.105
Excuse me.

586
00:28:31.532 --> 00:28:34.131
Can you play mom's song?

587
00:28:34.215 --> 00:28:37.025
I'd really like to hear it.

588
00:28:37.108 --> 00:28:38.613
Sure, buddy.

589
00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:41.506
I'll go get your guitar.

590
00:28:46.152 --> 00:28:48.188
On the third post of Christmas,

591
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.551
Carta de Amor reminded me
of the fun


592
00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:53.401
I had as a child
decorating a tree,


593
00:28:53.485 --> 00:28:55.478
going all out to let anyone
coming in know


594
00:28:55.562 --> 00:28:58.983
there is no mistaking
the holidays are here.


595
00:28:59.067 --> 00:29:02.398
Carta de Amor does have
its appeal.


596
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.523
That was wonderful.

597
00:29:58.606 --> 00:30:01.742
They said you were good but...

598
00:30:01.786 --> 00:30:03.369
Thanks.

599
00:30:03.411 --> 00:30:05.407
It's a special song.

600
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.933
I could tell.

601
00:30:08.016 --> 00:30:09.889
Do you wanna have
lunch tomorrow?


602
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.054
Both of you?

603
00:30:11.098 --> 00:30:13.986
Sorry, we're making a float
for a parade, but thank you.


604
00:30:14.069 --> 00:30:16.834
Well, I would love to.

605
00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:18.543
But not at the diner.

606
00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:19.848
There's somewhere else?

607
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.948
Yep.

608
00:30:21.032 --> 00:30:22.374
I might need a ride.

609
00:30:22.457 --> 00:30:25.632
I could call a taxi but I heard
the horse retired.


610
00:30:26.897 --> 00:30:29.299
I think I could find you a ride.

611
00:30:29.343 --> 00:30:30.523
How's noon?

612
00:30:30.606 --> 00:30:32.518
That's great.

613
00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:36.306
Thank you both
for a great night.


614
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.139
It was fun.

615
00:30:38.222 --> 00:30:40.137
Yeah.

616
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.144
Well, I'm gonna take a walk
and see if I can find a signal


617
00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:44.651
to post to my blog.

618
00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:46.159
OK.

619
00:30:46.242 --> 00:30:49.622
No place safer
than Carta de Amor.


620
00:30:49.705 --> 00:30:50.722
See you tomorrow.

621
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:51.783
Noon.

622
00:30:57.363 --> 00:30:59.724
OK, I think I officially
like her.


623
00:30:59.808 --> 00:31:01.395
Mmmhmm.

624
00:31:01.478 --> 00:31:03.308
Alright, your turn.

625
00:31:11.092 --> 00:31:13.779
<i>I really had a great
time decorating last night.</i>


626
00:31:13.863 --> 00:31:16.510
<i>I watched you.
I could tell.</i>


627
00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:21.935
You need to pick something up
from the school?


628
00:31:22.018 --> 00:31:25.112
Well, I promised you
a great lunch.


629
00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:26.580
Here?

630
00:31:27.438 --> 00:31:28.814
Yeah.

631
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:37.614
OK.

632
00:31:37.697 --> 00:31:40.748
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

633
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.623
I'm always hungry.

634
00:31:51.872 --> 00:31:53.820
What's this?

635
00:31:53.903 --> 00:31:57.446
Well, a much better lunch
than at the diner.


636
00:32:06.248 --> 00:32:07.630
Hi.

637
00:32:07.713 --> 00:32:09.341
Thank you.

638
00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:13.211
Today's menu is a small
shrimp salad,


639
00:32:13.294 --> 00:32:16.918
then my special chicken de amor,
followed by dessert.


640
00:32:19.238 --> 00:32:20.417
That sounds lovely.

641
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:23.716
You have no idea.

642
00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:27.717
So, what do you think?

643
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.387
I'm stunned.

644
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.787
You did make a lot
of yummy noises.


645
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:33.336
- Did I?
- Yeah.


646
00:32:37.087 --> 00:32:39.285
What did you do to this chicken?

647
00:32:39.327 --> 00:32:41.443
I'll be back with the dessert.

648
00:32:43.925 --> 00:32:45.144
Thank you.

649
00:32:45.188 --> 00:32:46.814
You didn't have to do this much.

650
00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:48.242
I wanted to.

651
00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:50.196
Your last post was different.

652
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.314
It was better.

653
00:32:52.397 --> 00:32:55.777
Well, I wanna thank you
for being so honest with me.


654
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.856
Honesty is important.

655
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.422
I appreciate you being
so open to it.


656
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.968
Soloing and stuff, I just like
to play the bass.


657
00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:07.390
Like, the rhythm.

658
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:09.379
No, you should though.

659
00:33:10.358 --> 00:33:12.189
Last course.

660
00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:17.404
This is so pretty
I'm afraid to eat it.


661
00:33:17.488 --> 00:33:18.627
What's it called?

662
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:20.053
Platino Frito.

663
00:33:20.137 --> 00:33:23.104
It's a traditional Christmas
dessert around here.


664
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.060
OK.

665
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:34.385
Can I take you home with me?

666
00:33:36.343 --> 00:33:37.319
Enjoy!

667
00:33:38.706 --> 00:33:40.006
I told you.

668
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.840
I mean, he's the best.

669
00:33:41.882 --> 00:33:43.836
And this is the best.

670
00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:50.686
Sure, I'd love to have
my own restaurant.


671
00:33:50.723 --> 00:33:52.717
But it's all timing.

672
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:54.332
Baloney. It's all about Betty.

673
00:33:54.415 --> 00:33:57.999
Betty? Librarian Betty?
My friend, Betty?


674
00:33:58.083 --> 00:33:59.139
Your friend, Betty?

675
00:33:59.223 --> 00:34:00.722
Yes, we have bonded.

676
00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:03.940
OK, well, Sam and Betty
have been friends for years


677
00:34:04.023 --> 00:34:07.445
and Betty has no idea
that Sam wants more.


678
00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:09.196
You gotta tell her.

679
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.866
I can't risk it.

680
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:12.859
What if she doesn't feel
the same way?


681
00:34:12.942 --> 00:34:15.141
Then I don't even have her
as a friend.


682
00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:17.952
See, this is the same answer
he gives every time I ask.


683
00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.338
Come on.

684
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.497
She's really smart
and really funny.


685
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:23.982
She's not gonna be
available forever.


686
00:34:24.066 --> 00:34:25.851
Heck, just cook for her
like this!


687
00:34:25.893 --> 00:34:27.316
That would work on me.

688
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.086
Yeah, but are you sure she
would like the school gym?


689
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.349
I don't know.

690
00:34:31.433 --> 00:34:33.672
The beautiful table,
the exclusivity.


691
00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:36.035
The food.

692
00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:37.705
Company.

693
00:34:39.784 --> 00:34:41.373
It's the holidays.

694
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:46.098
You keep talking about Christmas
like it's something special.


695
00:34:47.158 --> 00:34:49.317
It's growing on me.

696
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.939
About time.

697
00:34:52.447 --> 00:34:53.933
<i>On the fourth post of Christmas</i>

698
00:34:53.957 --> 00:34:56.357
<i>a surprise holiday meal
came to me.</i>


699
00:34:56.401 --> 00:34:59.332
It wasn't four calling birds
but a magical chicken dish


700
00:34:59.415 --> 00:35:01.898
in a place you
wouldn't expect it.


701
00:35:01.981 --> 00:35:04.423
A stealth master chef in
a cafeteria cook disguise


702
00:35:04.506 --> 00:35:08.700
made me a yuletide lunch
of epic proportions.


703
00:35:08.783 --> 00:35:10.674
I'm so sorry you all couldn't
have a bite of it,


704
00:35:10.698 --> 00:35:12.326
but that's OK.

705
00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:14.239
I wouldn't have shared it.

706
00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:24.419
Hey, I'm singing
and playing Christmas songs


707
00:35:24.503 --> 00:35:26.067
tomorrow night at
the lakeside inn.


708
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:27.759
Do you wanna come?

709
00:35:27.803 --> 00:35:30.041
Another chance to hear you play.

710
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:30.937
I'm in.

711
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.323
Great.

712
00:35:32.366 --> 00:35:34.603
Tonight, before
we light the tree,


713
00:35:34.687 --> 00:35:36.843
everyone who comes
hangs their ornament on it.


714
00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:40.430
Something meaningful.

715
00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:43.072
I'm waiting for you to tell me
the wishes come true.


716
00:35:43.114 --> 00:35:45.800
Some do. But some don't.

717
00:35:45.884 --> 00:35:48.001
I can tell you that
from experience.


718
00:35:48.084 --> 00:35:50.608
Maybe your wish will come true
this year.


719
00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:55.494
So, letting the town decorate
the tree?


720
00:35:55.577 --> 00:35:57.124
I never heard of that before.

721
00:35:57.168 --> 00:35:58.266
It's nice.

722
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:59.366
Yeah.

723
00:35:59.938 --> 00:36:02.462
So I'll see you around 8:00?

724
00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:03.682
You're leaving?

725
00:36:03.766 --> 00:36:05.088
I'm giving you some time
with Sean.


726
00:36:05.112 --> 00:36:08.037
Just remember, pick
your ornament carefully.


727
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.703
- Something that represents...
- My Christmas wish.


728
00:36:11.786 --> 00:36:13.333
Yeah.

729
00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:23.558
Hi!

730
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:24.332
Sorry I'm late.

731
00:36:24.374 --> 00:36:25.472
Hi.

732
00:36:25.556 --> 00:36:26.409
I knew you'd be here.

733
00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:27.633
Dad told you about the wishes?

734
00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:29.996
In great detail.

735
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.211
You've gotta do it.

736
00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:33.046
I do.

737
00:36:33.129 --> 00:36:35.080
And you know, honestly,

738
00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:37.811
when I first got here I just
wanted to report and go.


739
00:36:37.894 --> 00:36:41.886
But I think there's something
special about this place.


740
00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:43.067
Besides Christmas?

741
00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:45.230
Including Christmas.

742
00:36:45.274 --> 00:36:48.572
Alright, let's pick an ornament.

743
00:36:48.655 --> 00:36:50.446
You'll have to do that
by yourself.


744
00:36:50.488 --> 00:36:51.791
I'll be in the store,

745
00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:54.804
but afterwards I would love
to talk about writing.


746
00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:56.028
Deal.

747
00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:00.748
Christmas.

748
00:37:02.215 --> 00:37:03.781
<i>On the fifth post of Christmas</i>

749

753
00:37:15.617 --> 00:37:19.243
Okay. Christmas or the world?

754
00:37:20.343 --> 00:37:23.026

<i>Carta de Amor's universal
Christmas spirit.</i>


758
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:35.366
Did you find one?

759
00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:36.547
I did.

760
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:37.894
I'm gonna go pay for this

761
00:37:37.935 --> 00:37:39.828
and then let's go get some
ice cream and talk.


762
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.438
Will do.

763
00:37:51.456 --> 00:37:52.675
Caroline Williams.

764
00:37:52.758 --> 00:37:53.898
<i>Caroline.</i>

Valerie Warshaw,
global destinations magazine.


766
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.072
Ms. Warshaw,
yes.


767
00:37:59.114 --> 00:38:00.986
You can just call me Valerie.

768
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.454
I was calling to let you know

769
00:38:02.537 --> 00:38:05.060
how much we're enjoying
your Christmas blog here.


770
00:38:05.102 --> 00:38:06.567
You mean my yule blog?

771
00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.667
That's genius.

772
00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:08.970
I hope you use it.

773
00:38:09.054 --> 00:38:10.315
I plan to.

774
00:38:10.398 --> 00:38:11.802
You know, this Carta de Amor
assignment


775
00:38:11.826 --> 00:38:13.578
has turned out to be
very interesting.


776
00:38:15.077 --> 00:38:16.970
Well, my friends are out
shopping for Christmas ponchos.


777
00:38:16.992 --> 00:38:17.970
You did that.

778
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.353
<i>Keep up the good work.</i>

779
00:38:19.436 --> 00:38:21.742
And I'll let you know
about the job soon.


780
00:38:21.785 --> 00:38:23.860
It looks quite promising.

781
00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:25.488
It's my dream job.

782
00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:28.218
<i>It's every travel reporter's
dream job.</i>


783
00:38:28.302 --> 00:38:32.251
Any-who, happy holidays if you
don't hear from me before that.


784
00:38:32.335 --> 00:38:34.532
OK, thank you.

785
00:38:38.766 --> 00:38:40.801
Did that really just happen?

786
00:38:47.506 --> 00:38:49.479
So, what'd you choose this year,
Sean?


787
00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:51.416
I'm gonna start as shortstop.

788
00:38:51.499 --> 00:38:53.452
Hey, that is a good wish.

789
00:38:57.569 --> 00:39:00.656
I notice you don't have
an ornament, Mr. C.


790
00:39:02.452 --> 00:39:03.997
What'd I say?

791
00:39:04.081 --> 00:39:07.338
All the ornaments are
my Christmas wishes.


792
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:14.831
Anybody wanna tell me
what that means?


793
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.513
Mine is the same as the last
eight years.


794
00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:22.564
That's a good wish.

795
00:39:23.354 --> 00:39:24.536
Yeah.

796
00:39:26.976 --> 00:39:28.644
Mine is the same as Oscar's

797
00:39:28.727 --> 00:39:30.640
because we both wish
for the same thing.


798
00:39:30.723 --> 00:39:32.718
Peace for him.

799
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:34.590
Peace for Oscar?

800
00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:37.035
Eight years since Judy passed.

801
00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:40.784
Sean's mother.

802
00:39:40.826 --> 00:39:44.084
That's why Oscar came home
from L.A.


803
00:39:55.201 --> 00:39:56.788
Your turn.

804
00:39:58.013 --> 00:40:01.188
What's your Christmas wish?

805
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.853
The world?

806
00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:07.542
It's job related.

807
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:11.249
I know it seems small
compared to your wishes.


808
00:40:11.332 --> 00:40:12.798
No.

809
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:16.050
Christmas wishes can be
anything you want.


810
00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.598
Go hang it.

811

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:30.308

about some place,</i>


816

reporting it or not,</i>


817
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.378

818
00:40:36.422 --> 00:40:39.313
<i>It's a night of hope and
community here in Carta de Amor,</i>


819
00:40:39.396 --> 00:40:42.606

820

<i>Including me.</i>

821
00:41:11.688 --> 00:41:12.705
Beautiful.

822
00:41:14.213 --> 00:41:18.081
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.


823
00:41:18.165 --> 00:41:19.503
Can I go to my friend's house?

824
00:41:19.984 --> 00:41:21.368
Yeah, of course.

825
00:41:21.451 --> 00:41:23.179
If you need a ride home
you just let me know, OK?


826
00:41:23.203 --> 00:41:24.137
I'll come get you.

827
00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:25.157
Thanks.

828
00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:30.822
Boy, that brings back memories.
The safety of a small town.


829
00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.160
It's rare these days.

830
00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:36.275
Oh yeah. When I was in L.A.
I was always on guard.


831
00:41:36.359 --> 00:41:38.231
Do you miss it?

832
00:41:38.273 --> 00:41:40.267
Yeah, I do sometimes.

833
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:44.788
Then I look at Sean
and I don't anymore.


834
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:47.232
Do you miss your small town?

835
00:41:47.274 --> 00:41:49.065
I didn't.

836
00:41:49.148 --> 00:41:53.670
But then I look around
at all this and I kinda do.


837
00:41:53.753 --> 00:41:57.410
I guess we have something
in common after all.


838
00:41:57.494 --> 00:41:59.978
Hey, I've got a signal.
I should probably go.


839
00:42:00.061 --> 00:42:01.566
Yeah. Work.

840
00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:05.722
It can wait.

841
00:42:05.805 --> 00:42:07.310
It's a beautiful night.

842
00:42:07.394 --> 00:42:10.325
Do you want to walk me back
to the B&B?


843
00:42:10.368 --> 00:42:13.625
It would be my pleasure.

844
00:42:27.009 --> 00:42:32.630
Hey, I'm so sorry
about your wife.


845
00:42:32.714 --> 00:42:35.600
Nobody said life was fair.

846
00:42:35.684 --> 00:42:38.045
You either curl up or you cope.

847
00:42:40.247 --> 00:42:41.927
If I hadn't had Sean
to think about


848
00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:44.442
I might have curled up.

849
00:42:44.526 --> 00:42:47.125
You're a good dad.

850
00:42:47.208 --> 00:42:49.772
Thanks. I try.

851
00:42:49.855 --> 00:42:51.402
It's harder at Christmas.

852
00:42:53.116 --> 00:42:56.821
To be honest, you're making
it easier this year.


853
00:42:56.862 --> 00:42:59.754
I'm not sure what I've done.

854
00:42:59.837 --> 00:43:02.524
You've exceeded my expectations.

855
00:43:02.607 --> 00:43:04.804
Camilla said you needed
some help with Christmas spirit


856
00:43:04.888 --> 00:43:06.965
but after a rough start...

857
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.812
You seem to be doing fine
on your own.


858
00:43:12.908 --> 00:43:14.576
Your posts show it, too.

859
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.348
Well, if my posts show it,
it's because of you.


860
00:43:17.389 --> 00:43:19.466
Your family.

861
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.969
I think it's in Carta de Amor's
DNA, honestly.


862
00:43:23.053 --> 00:43:24.600
Yeah.

863
00:43:24.683 --> 00:43:27.325
And I might have missed
Christmas a little.


864
00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:29.894
Well.

865
00:43:31.158 --> 00:43:34.089
I'm glad you're still reading
my posts.


866
00:43:34.132 --> 00:43:36.125
Everybody in town is.

867
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:38.564
You're a celebrity now.

868
00:43:38.647 --> 00:43:39.765
Not in the dog house anymore?

869
00:43:39.789 --> 00:43:40.765
No.

870
00:43:47.314 --> 00:43:50.083
OK, I really need to ask
you about him...


871
00:43:50.124 --> 00:43:52.201
Hey, do you wanna
come over tomorrow?


872
00:43:52.243 --> 00:43:54.808
There's a couple more Christmas
traditions I'd like to share.


873
00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:57.129
Might be good for your blog.

874
00:43:57.212 --> 00:44:03.072
But mostly because
I would like it.


875
00:44:04.988 --> 00:44:07.349
I'd love to.

876
00:44:07.432 --> 00:44:11.628
Just... just say when
and I'll be there.


877
00:44:11.712 --> 00:44:13.054
Great.

878
00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:27.630
Thank you.

879
00:44:27.713 --> 00:44:29.341
Thanks for coming.

880
00:44:29.383 --> 00:44:31.581
Dad's out planning with
the parade committee.


881
00:44:31.665 --> 00:44:34.433
So, are you ready to cook?

882
00:44:34.516 --> 00:44:36.755
Christmas cookies?

883
00:44:36.839 --> 00:44:39.567
You should know my mother and I
were champs at it.


884
00:44:39.651 --> 00:44:41.156
How are you at tamales?

885
00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:42.703
Tamales?

886
00:44:42.786 --> 00:44:43.926
Christmas tamales.

887
00:44:44.009 --> 00:44:44.945
Yeah.

888
00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:46.451
People come from far and wide

889
00:44:46.534 --> 00:44:48.019
for my mom's tamales
at Christmas time.


890
00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:50.037
I thought you might wanna watch.

891
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.097
Just watch?

892
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:53.453
No way.

893
00:44:53.496 --> 00:44:54.878
Oh, really?

894
00:44:56.917 --> 00:44:57.975
Wanna help?

895
00:44:58.059 --> 00:44:59.483
Start shucking.

896
00:44:59.566 --> 00:45:00.622
Like this.

897
00:45:00.706 --> 00:45:02.394
This corn's pickled
and ready to grind.


898
00:45:02.418 --> 00:45:04.248
Are you making masa
from scratch?


899
00:45:04.332 --> 00:45:05.794
You know tamales?

900
00:45:05.878 --> 00:45:07.605
I did a story last month
in Costa Rica,


901
00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:10.969
but are you gonna grind
the corn yourself?


902
00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:13.535
Nana said we're gonna do it
just like the Aztecs did,


903
00:45:13.618 --> 00:45:14.840
with rocks.

904
00:45:14.923 --> 00:45:15.978
OK, I'm in.

905
00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:17.813
Where are the rocks?

906
00:45:17.897 --> 00:45:20.943
This is my rock,
but I have to admit


907
00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:24.285
I'm impressed you were up
for it.


908
00:45:24.368 --> 00:45:26.198
I was joking.

909
00:45:34.187 --> 00:45:38.910
What do you say about letting
Caroline and me finish these up?


910
00:45:38.952 --> 00:45:41.313
I'm game if he is.

911
00:45:41.357 --> 00:45:43.793
We could take a look
at my Christmas list.


912
00:45:43.835 --> 00:45:46.114
You sure?

913
00:45:46.197 --> 00:45:47.702
OK.

914
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:50.147
Christmas list it is.

915
00:45:54.493 --> 00:45:56.037
This smells amazing.

916
00:45:56.081 --> 00:45:59.215
I never get tired of that smell.

917
00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:01.190
It takes me back to my
grandmother's kitchen.


918
00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.921
Now I gotta get another spoon.

919
00:46:12.004 --> 00:46:12.980
What?

920
00:46:13.023 --> 00:46:14.405
Who needs a spoon?

921
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:19.946
OK!

922
00:46:19.988 --> 00:46:21.046
It's on!

923
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.593
It's on!!

924
00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:39.087
My-my mom is gonna be mad.

925
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.962
Just tell her it's my fault.

926
00:46:41.003 --> 00:46:43.774
I think she's still mad at me
about that first blog post.


927
00:46:43.857 --> 00:46:45.118
No.

928
00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:47.049
Sometimes it's hard to combat
preconceived notions


929
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:48.741
but she'll come around.

930
00:46:48.824 --> 00:46:50.085
I did.

931
00:46:50.169 --> 00:46:51.430
Oh, you did, huh?

932
00:46:51.471 --> 00:46:54.649
I have. Completely.

933
00:46:54.732 --> 00:46:55.971
I always thought
you were trouble.


934
00:46:55.995 --> 00:46:56.685
Oh yeah?

935
00:46:57.664 --> 00:46:58.802
At first.

936
00:46:58.885 --> 00:47:00.752
But today I know for a fact.

937
00:47:09.798 --> 00:47:11.141
Sean.

938
00:47:11.184 --> 00:47:12.485
What're you doing?

939
00:47:12.568 --> 00:47:14.054
I think I should be the one
asking that question.


940
00:47:14.076 --> 00:47:16.153
It's not what you think.

941
00:47:16.236 --> 00:47:17.291
I think it was.

942
00:47:17.375 --> 00:47:18.942
<i>Doesn't sound like
cooking to me.</i>


943
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:21.473
OK, out.

944
00:47:21.557 --> 00:47:23.348
Go clean up, both of you.

945
00:47:23.392 --> 00:47:25.073
I can't believe you did this
to my kitchen.


946
00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:26.194
It's my kitchen.

947
00:47:26.277 --> 00:47:27.254
I'll clean up.

948
00:47:27.336 --> 00:47:28.149
We'll clean up.

949
00:47:28.232 --> 00:47:29.482
I don't trust either one of you.

950
00:47:29.537 --> 00:47:30.430
Out.

951
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.753
I need to salvage these tamales.

952
00:47:31.777 --> 00:47:33.568
Your father is counting on them.

953
00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:34.545
Me too.

954
00:47:34.628 --> 00:47:35.931
Yeah, so am I.

955
00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.631
OK, OK.

956
00:47:43.345 --> 00:47:44.892
Dios mio.

957
00:47:46.768 --> 00:47:48.638
<i>Go ahead, eat sweetheart.</i>

958
00:47:56.579 --> 00:47:59.511
I could write an entire article
on these alone.


959
00:47:59.553 --> 00:48:01.201
You should be making these
all year.


960
00:48:01.223 --> 00:48:03.665
No. They only taste
like this at Christmas.


961
00:48:03.749 --> 00:48:05.907
And it's only Christmas
when we get them.


962
00:48:05.991 --> 00:48:07.537
And it's Christmas.

963
00:48:07.578 --> 00:48:08.554
And I'm hungry.

964
00:48:08.597 --> 00:48:10.753
Hey, that-that is mine.

965
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:23.892
I haven't had that much fun
in a long time.


966
00:48:23.976 --> 00:48:25.604
Me neither.

967
00:48:25.646 --> 00:48:27.071
But...

968
00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:28.778
You want to slow it down.

969
00:48:28.862 --> 00:48:30.327
For Sean, I get it.

970
00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:33.953
No. No, actually Sean
seems fine.


971
00:48:34.037 --> 00:48:37.539
It's my own conflicted feelings
I think.


972
00:48:37.622 --> 00:48:41.566
I haven't felt these emotions
in a long time.


973
00:48:41.649 --> 00:48:43.724
I'm not going anywhere.

974
00:48:43.768 --> 00:48:46.048
At least not for a few days.

975
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:48.287
There's also that
to think about.


976
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.568
You think about that then.

977
00:48:50.612 --> 00:48:53.136
I'll be thinking about you.

978
00:48:53.178 --> 00:48:55.213
I'll see you tonight.

979
00:48:55.296 --> 00:48:58.226
I can't wait to hear you
sing again.


980
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:19.478
Thank you, Sean.

981
00:49:43.144 --> 00:49:44.608
On the seventh post of Christmas

982
00:49:44.692 --> 00:49:47.867
Carta de Amor is gonna make
the Christmas cookie obsolete.


983
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:50.598
Introducing the Christmas
tamale.


984
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:52.017
<i>It's a family tradition here</i>

985
00:49:52.101 --> 00:49:53.828
<i>and one that I got
to participate in.</i>


986
00:49:53.852 --> 00:49:55.702
<i>I wish that blog posts came
with scratch and sniff</i>


987
00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:58.699
<i>because it smelled so good.</i>

988
00:49:58.782 --> 00:50:00.224
<i>Only when the ingredients
are well mixed</i>


989
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:03.506
can the tamales
come out perfectly.


990
00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:07.129
Well, near perfection.

991
00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:11.937
And... yum.

992
00:50:17.758 --> 00:50:18.619
Hello?

993
00:50:18.703 --> 00:50:20.208
<i>It's Betty.</i>

994
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:25.463
<i>In your blog did you mean "yum"
for the tamales or for him?</i>


995
00:50:25.547 --> 00:50:26.970
Both.

996
00:50:47.499 --> 00:50:48.353
Hey.

997
00:50:48.437 --> 00:50:49.535
I'm so glad to see you here.

998
00:50:49.618 --> 00:50:50.798
You too.

999
00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:54.219
You're looking smoking hot.

1000
00:50:54.303 --> 00:50:57.149
I might be a tad overdressed.

1001
00:50:57.193 --> 00:50:59.473
If anyone thinks that,
they're just jealous.


1002
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.573
I'm jealous.

1003
00:51:16.822 --> 00:51:18.981
He looks happy.

1004
00:51:19.023 --> 00:51:20.121
This is new?

1005
00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:21.914
This is new.

1006
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.010
This is you.

1007
00:51:47.247 --> 00:51:48.630
What a night, huh?

1008
00:51:48.713 --> 00:51:53.397
As I look around at all
my friends, old and new,


1009
00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:55.597
I think we are the luckiest
people in the world


1010
00:51:55.638 --> 00:51:59.054
to be right here, right now.

1011
00:51:59.137 --> 00:52:02.638
There's nothing like a carta
de amor Christmas.


1012
00:52:05.045 --> 00:52:08.301
And there's no song like
this one to close out the night.


1013
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.852
Thanks guys.

1014
00:53:22.648 --> 00:53:25.539
I think I'm just going to stick
around for a minute.


1015
00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:30.302
Yeah, that sounds great.

1016
00:53:42.479 --> 00:53:44.310
It's wonderful.

1017
00:53:44.394 --> 00:53:47.244
I was waiting for you
to play your song.


1018
00:53:47.328 --> 00:53:48.589
What song?

1019
00:53:48.672 --> 00:53:51.480
The song that you sang to Sean.

1020
00:53:51.524 --> 00:53:54.780
Yeah, that-that's Judy's song.

1021
00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:57.468
I don't really play it
in public anymore.


1022
00:53:57.512 --> 00:54:01.054
I didn't know.
I just like it.


1023
00:54:01.096 --> 00:54:03.458
Yeah, I...

1024
00:54:03.542 --> 00:54:06.182
I love it, too.
But it's reserved.


1025
00:54:06.265 --> 00:54:07.037
OK.

1026
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.260
Yeah, I get it.

1027
00:54:09.972 --> 00:54:12.496
Do you wanna grab a coffee
or something?


1028
00:54:14.535 --> 00:54:18.482
Maybe not tonight.
I'm tired, you know.


1029
00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:21.579
Yeah, OK.

1030
00:54:24.026 --> 00:54:26.020
See you later.

1031
00:54:46.023 --> 00:54:46.998
<i>Caroline.</i>

1032
00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:55.304
Does that offer for coffee
still stand?


1033
00:54:55.387 --> 00:54:56.769
Of course.

1034
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.843
Thanks.

1035
00:55:06.101 --> 00:55:08.866
You found me a white
chocolate mocha?


1036
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:11.434
Yeah, I pay attention.

1037
00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:13.511
Thank you for both.

1038
00:55:13.555 --> 00:55:16.160
The coffee and for paying
attention.


1039
00:55:18.606 --> 00:55:20.593
Sorry for back at the inn.

1040
00:55:20.677 --> 00:55:23.080
That was so rude.

1041
00:55:23.163 --> 00:55:25.198
I get it.

1042
00:55:25.282 --> 00:55:27.437
It's that song.

1043
00:55:27.521 --> 00:55:30.331
This time of the year.

1044
00:55:30.414 --> 00:55:33.427
The guilt.

1045
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.057
You.

1046
00:55:39.172 --> 00:55:41.575
I like being with you, too.

1047
00:55:45.116 --> 00:55:46.991
How'd you know
that's what I meant?


1048
00:55:47.074 --> 00:55:48.416
I'm a writer.

1049
00:55:48.499 --> 00:55:50.004
I understand subtext.

1050
00:55:53.348 --> 00:55:55.384
Wherever it goes...

1051
00:55:57.909 --> 00:55:59.902
I'm happy right now.

1052
00:56:02.228 --> 00:56:03.814
Me too.

1053
00:56:15.502 --> 00:56:17.862
To Christmas and the joy
that it brings.


1054
00:56:17.906 --> 00:56:20.837
May this Christmas bring you
peace and love.


1055
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.141
I like that.

1056
00:56:22.225 --> 00:56:24.260
So no coal for any of us
this year?


1057
00:56:25.525 --> 00:56:26.663
No coal.

1058
00:56:26.746 --> 00:56:28.455
No coal, indeed.

1059
00:56:28.538 --> 00:56:30.532
Merry Christmas.

1060
00:56:34.039 --> 00:56:36.964
I want you to help me put out
Christmas lights tomorrow


1061
00:56:37.047 --> 00:56:37.886
at my house.

1062
00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:39.068
Sam usually helps me.

1063
00:56:39.151 --> 00:56:41.959
Speaking of Sam, don't
you think that Christmas


1064
00:56:42.043 --> 00:56:45.911
is the perfect time for him to
finally tell Betty how he feels?


1065
00:56:45.994 --> 00:56:47.339
You should tell him.

1066
00:56:47.422 --> 00:56:53.406
Well, you know, sometimes
it's hard to tell someone...


1067
00:56:53.448 --> 00:56:56.991
Special how you really feel.

1068
00:57:01.672 --> 00:57:06.924
So you wanna help me
with the lights?


1069
00:57:07.008 --> 00:57:10.510
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.


1070
00:57:12.223 --> 00:57:15.399
This is going to be such
a Merry Christmas.


1071
00:57:15.482 --> 00:57:17.518
It already is.

1072
00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:27.685
On the eighth post of Christmas
this city of Carta de Amor


1073
00:57:27.769 --> 00:57:30.781
gets more serious about
their Christmas celebrations,


1074
00:57:30.823 --> 00:57:32.247
if that's possible.

1075
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.856
Getting ready for a big parade
that I cannot wait to see,


1076
00:57:34.939 --> 00:57:37.581
I helped my friend Sean
decorate their float.


1077
00:57:38.928 --> 00:57:42.187
<i>Christmas is in full swing here
in Carta de Amor.</i>


1078
00:57:46.507 --> 00:57:47.277
Hey.

1079
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.332
Hi.

1080
00:57:48.373 --> 00:57:50.206
Do you want me to grab
the ladder?


1081
00:57:50.289 --> 00:57:52.477
I used to do that for my dad
when we'd put up lights.


1082
00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:55.990
That's very sweet but
we don't need the ladder.


1083
00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:57.598
How are we gonna
put the lights up, then?


1084
00:57:57.622 --> 00:57:58.476
They don't go up.

1085
00:57:58.559 --> 00:57:59.535
They go down.

1086
00:57:59.578 --> 00:58:01.041
On the ground.

1087
00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:03.831
What kind of Christmas lights
go down on the ground?


1088
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:05.972
The most meaningful kind.

1089
00:58:06.055 --> 00:58:07.111
Wait here.

1090
00:58:17.049 --> 00:58:18.798
I'm completely mystified.

1091
00:58:18.882 --> 00:58:21.283
In the late 1800's
at Christmastime


1092
00:58:21.326 --> 00:58:23.769
the locals marked the paths
of their houses


1093
00:58:23.852 --> 00:58:26.255
with small, controlled bonfires

1094
00:58:26.335 --> 00:58:29.266
to light the way
for the holy family.


1095
00:58:32.446 --> 00:58:36.274
The invention of the paper bag
changed everything.


1096
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:41.768
Pass me a candle, please.

1097
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.882
We do this to honour
the tradition,


1098
00:58:45.926 --> 00:58:49.426
and it also saves us from having
to buy wood for the fires.


1099
00:58:49.509 --> 00:58:50.770
It's probably safer, too.

1100
00:58:50.814 --> 00:58:52.196
And there's that.

1101
00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.559
We call them farolitos.

1102
00:58:54.643 --> 00:58:56.638
Some people call
them luminarias.


1103
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.389
I like farolitos.

1104
00:58:58.472 --> 00:59:00.118
Do you wanna help me
light the path?


1105
00:59:00.142 --> 00:59:01.852
Are you kidding?

1106
00:59:01.894 --> 00:59:03.401
I'd love to.

1107
00:59:42.097 --> 00:59:44.744
There aren't words.

1108
00:59:44.786 --> 00:59:46.495
<i>I never get tired of it.</i>

1109
00:59:46.579 --> 00:59:49.509
<i>In fact, I missed it
when I was in L.A.</i>


1110
00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:55.615
Greendale was Christmas
light central.


1111
00:59:55.699 --> 00:59:57.775
Not like this.

1112
00:59:57.858 --> 01:00:01.564
But I didn't realize I missed it
until tonight.


1113
01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:12.478
No one is getting lost tonight,
either.


1114
01:00:12.562 --> 01:00:14.720
Or until Christmas.

1115
01:00:16.555 --> 01:00:18.508
Can we walk and see them all?

1116
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.811
Of course.

1117
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.536
I'm gonna grab a jacket.
Do you need anything?


1118
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.066
No, thanks.

1119
01:00:23.107 --> 01:00:25.266
I'm gonna post
to the blog first.


1120
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:27.403
This is so amazing I don't wanna
be thinking about work


1121
01:00:27.426 --> 01:00:29.379
while we look at them.

1122
01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:31.375
OK. I'll be right back.

1123

<i>It was... magic.</i>

1130
01:00:57.632 --> 01:01:01.051
I may have lost my way to
the holidays over the years


1131
01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:03.212
but these lights will never
let me lose my way


1132

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.597
<i>to find it again, I think.</i>

1139
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.674
<i>You think?</i>

1140
01:01:24.758 --> 01:01:26.142
<i>I know.</i>

1141
01:01:29.932 --> 01:01:33.190
Hey, you wanna go check
on our Christmas wishes?


1142
01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:35.629
Everyone goes back
to the tree over the holidays


1143
01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:37.706
to check their wish.

1144
01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:39.518
You have a lot of Christmas
traditions here


1145
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.598
to keep track of.

1146
01:01:42.228 --> 01:01:43.916
Yeah, I never really thought
of it before


1147
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.832
but I guess you're right.

1148
01:01:57.779 --> 01:02:00.018
Are you taking your wish
off the tree?


1149
01:02:00.101 --> 01:02:01.926
No, never.

1150
01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:03.800
It's just... every year

1151
01:02:03.884 --> 01:02:06.285
I put my wish for a restaurant
on the tree.


1152
01:02:06.368 --> 01:02:07.466
And this year...

1153
01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.974
Sam?

1154
01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.928
Is that Betty?

1155
01:02:15.942 --> 01:02:16.920
Catch you later.

1156
01:02:17.003 --> 01:02:18.362
No, you're not going
anywhere, buster.


1157
01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:20.545
- Hi.
- Hi.


1158
01:02:20.628 --> 01:02:23.152
I guess I wasn't the only one
with this idea.


1159
01:02:23.194 --> 01:02:25.636
I guess not.

1160
01:02:25.713 --> 01:02:27.709
Which one is yours?

1161
01:02:37.937 --> 01:02:41.068
OK, time for a Christmas
miracle.


1162
01:02:41.151 --> 01:02:46.610
This one is Sam's and it's you.

1163
01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.611
I'm crazy about you.

1164
01:02:53.652 --> 01:02:56.013
I was afraid if you didn't feel
the same way


1165
01:02:56.097 --> 01:02:57.807
I'd lose you as a friend.

1166
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.150
Me too.

1167
01:03:23.998 --> 01:03:26.522
Christmas wishes coming true.

1168
01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:41.830
You made mine come true, too.

1169
01:03:41.914 --> 01:03:43.461
How?

1170
01:03:45.337 --> 01:03:49.002
I've been looking for some peace
in my life


1171
01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:54.054
and I have not felt this much
in years.


1172
01:03:54.137 --> 01:03:55.682
Thank you.

1173
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.941
It's been a long time
since I felt this comfortable


1174
01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:06.201
with anyone or any place, too.

1175
01:04:06.245 --> 01:04:08.151
It's all so special.

1176
01:04:10.636 --> 01:04:13.202
Yeah.

1177
01:04:13.246 --> 01:04:17.602
Spend Christmas Eve with me.
With my family.


1178
01:04:23.223 --> 01:04:24.933
I'd be honoured.

1179
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.725
Betty and Sam found each other

1180
01:04:29.785 --> 01:04:32.426
<i>in the light of the community
Christmas tree.</i>


1181
01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:34.789
<i>Christmas wishes coming true.</i>

1182
01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:36.947
I wish you were all here
to share it with me.


1183
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:38.332
You really should come.

1184
01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.291
It can't be described in words.

1185
01:04:41.374 --> 01:04:45.731
OMG I think I might have
writer's block.


1186
01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:49.519
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow
and for the first time


1187
01:04:49.604 --> 01:04:53.554
in years and years I'm actually
excited by the idea.


1188
01:04:53.638 --> 01:04:56.277
And if it's even a fraction
of what I've experienced so far


1189
01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.148
it will be beyond wonderful.

1190
01:05:14.163 --> 01:05:15.789
Good morning.

1191
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:17.949
I can't believe I slept so late.

1192
01:05:18.032 --> 01:05:19.658
I guess I missed breakfast, huh?

1193
01:05:19.742 --> 01:05:21.261
I'm sure I can find
you something.


1194
01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.669
You've been so nice.

1195
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.094
Both of you.

1196
01:05:24.178 --> 01:05:26.865
I'm actually going dress
shopping for tonight with Betty.


1197
01:05:26.948 --> 01:05:30.815
I'm spending it at Oscar's.

1198
01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:32.567
What do you do on Christmas Eve?

1199
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.686
I'll be at Oscar's with you.

1200
01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:35.981
I'm so glad you're both coming.

1201
01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.335
Just me.

1202
01:05:37.418 --> 01:05:38.678
Everyone knows Mr. C.

1203
01:05:38.761 --> 01:05:41.653
has a standing engagement
on Christmas Eve.


1204
01:05:44.955 --> 01:05:46.129
Of course he does.

1205
01:05:46.524 --> 01:05:48.435
Of course he does.

1206
01:05:48.518 --> 01:05:52.754
Probably a small trip around
the world with some reindeer.


1207
01:05:58.092 --> 01:06:00.287
<i>Yes, Betty, I am still
very excited about tonight.</i>


1208
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.349
Caroline?

1209
01:06:02.817 --> 01:06:05.422
Ms. Warshaw.

1210
01:06:05.506 --> 01:06:06.767
I mean, Valerie.

1211
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.111
<i>I
- I wasn't expecting...</i>

1212
01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:10.229
I thought I'd give you
an early gift.


1213
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:11.649
The dream job's yours.

1214
01:06:11.732 --> 01:06:14.461
<i>We'll spend the first week
going over your package</i>


1215
01:06:14.544 --> 01:06:15.805
and then it's off to London

1216
01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.924
for your coming out
at the London expo.


1217
01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.919
Of course, that's
after new year's.


1218
01:06:22.365 --> 01:06:23.341
I'm stunned.

1219
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:29.370
I... I thought you'd be out
for the holidays.


1220
01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.938
I just... I wasn't expecting
to hear from you so soon.


1221
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.363
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1222
01:06:33.447 --> 01:06:36.167
<i>I'm much too busy to worry
about Christmas.</i>


1223
01:06:36.211 --> 01:06:38.205
And you will be, too, soon.

1224
01:06:39.755 --> 01:06:41.341
<i>Are you there?</i>

1225
01:06:41.385 --> 01:06:43.379
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course.


1226
01:06:43.462 --> 01:06:44.600
I'm just...

1227
01:06:44.683 --> 01:06:46.067
So I'll see you in New York.

1228
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:47.046
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

1229
01:06:47.088 --> 01:06:48.512
On Christmas?

1230
01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:49.895
Of course, yes.

1231
01:06:49.978 --> 01:06:52.746
On the 26th then.
Bright and early.


1232
01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:53.928
<i>See you then.</i>

1233
01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.658
It's just-I’m-I'm in
New Mexico so I...


1234
01:06:56.742 --> 01:06:58.573
Hello? Valerie?

1235
01:07:18.153 --> 01:07:19.901
You OK?

1236
01:07:19.985 --> 01:07:21.125
Yeah.

1237
01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:24.709
I'm just thinking about
some work stuff.


1238
01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.205
Don't think about work tonight.

1239
01:07:39.247 --> 01:07:41.241
It's Christmas Eve.

1240
01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.769
Besides, we still have my
favourite tradition to go.


1241
01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:46.050
The parade, that's mine.

1242
01:07:48.048 --> 01:07:50.857
Mine is the Christmas wishes
on the tree.


1243
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:54.068
Well, you do have a lot of
traditions here to choose from.


1244
01:07:54.151 --> 01:07:56.288
Have you figured out which
is your favourite one yet?


1245
01:07:56.312 --> 01:07:58.712
Let her experience them all,
mama.


1246
01:07:58.796 --> 01:07:59.893
And tonight's mine.

1247
01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:01.809
OK. I give.

1248
01:08:01.851 --> 01:08:04.294
What happens tonight?

1249
01:08:05.151 --> 01:08:08.654
Well, we... we remember
and honour loved ones


1250
01:08:08.738 --> 01:08:14.398
who aren't here to share this
with us.


1251
01:08:14.482 --> 01:08:15.945
<i>Really?</i>

1252
01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:17.855
Yeah.

1253
01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:22.336
And that way we're still sharing
Christmas with them.


1254
01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:25.921
That's beautiful.

1255
01:08:25.964 --> 01:08:28.407
I like this one.

1256
01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:31.623
I'd like to talk about mom.

1257
01:08:31.706 --> 01:08:35.493
I- I do miss mom a little bit,
but that's OK


1258
01:08:35.577 --> 01:08:38.019
'cause I know she's here
with us on Christmas


1259
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:40.911
<i>and that's all that matters
to me.</i>


1260
01:08:43.799 --> 01:08:45.427
<i>I'd like to go next.</i>

1261
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:54.429
Best memories of Tommy Rowland,
a quality man.


1262
01:08:54.513 --> 01:08:59.035
We spent the best Christmases
of our lives together


1263
01:08:59.076 --> 01:09:00.795
and he also did one thing for me

1264
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:02.643
that I'll always be
grateful for.


1265
01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:08.101
When he was principal he hired
Betty to be librarian.


1266
01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:13.968
I wish he was here
to see us together.


1267
01:09:14.051 --> 01:09:15.475
Me too.

1268
01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.350
That was great, Sam.

1269
01:09:19.552 --> 01:09:21.910
So, who's next?

1270
01:09:25.008 --> 01:09:26.799
This is gonna be a good night.

1271
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.955
...and then he almost fell
in the fishing hole,


1272
01:09:29.977 --> 01:09:33.637
but instead the dog went in
and everybody got wet!


1273
01:09:37.223 --> 01:09:38.689
I don't understand!

1274
01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:57.143
Abuelita Pilar
only spoke Spanish.


1275
01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.279
Abuelita.

1276
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.927
Yeah, grandma.

1277
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:05.000
She used to pad around
the kitchen in her slippers.


1278
01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:08.707
She always had hot chocolate,
or chocolate milk for us kids.


1279
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.174
And hugs.

1280
01:10:10.218 --> 01:10:11.597
Lots of hugs.

1281
01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:12.697
Camilla!

1282
01:10:12.781 --> 01:10:14.002
I would have picked you up.

1283
01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.731
Orlando took his horses
out of retirement for me.


1284
01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:18.892
That's a real thing?

1285
01:10:18.933 --> 01:10:20.112
Yeah.

1286
01:10:29.153 --> 01:10:30.738
You've assimilated well.

1287
01:10:30.822 --> 01:10:32.817
Just doing my job.

1288
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:36.239
No, that's not true.

1289
01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:38.888
I'm here because
I wanna be here.


1290
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.780
And I wanna say something
to all of you.


1291
01:10:41.864 --> 01:10:46.546
I would like to say...
Merry Christmas!


1292
01:10:49.638 --> 01:10:51.225
Merry Christmas.

1293
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.852
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1294
01:10:54.893 --> 01:10:56.440
Thank you.

1295
01:10:59.577 --> 01:11:02.875
Caroline, your posts from here
have been incredible for us.


1296
01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:05.522
That thing that makes
your writing special?


1297
01:11:05.566 --> 01:11:06.785
It's back.

1298
01:11:06.869 --> 01:11:08.009
Thank you.

1299
01:11:08.092 --> 01:11:10.736
There's a bonus coming.

1300
01:11:10.819 --> 01:11:15.293
Thank you, Camilla, but I really
need to talk to you in private.


1301
01:11:15.377 --> 01:11:18.105
If it's about business it
can wait until after Christmas.


1302
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:20.019
I don't do business
at Christmas.


1303
01:11:20.062 --> 01:11:21.405
And neither should you.

1304
01:11:21.488 --> 01:11:22.628
Now, I'm tired.

1305
01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:25.031
I'll see you at the parade?

1306
01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.456
Goodnight, Camilla.

1307
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:39.081
Thank you.

1308
01:11:39.123 --> 01:11:40.015
For what?

1309
01:11:40.099 --> 01:11:41.362
You said "Merry Christmas".

1310
01:11:41.403 --> 01:11:42.928
I haven't heard you say
that before.


1311
01:11:42.952 --> 01:11:44.843
I have, too.
Haven't I?


1312
01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:45.843
No.

1313
01:11:47.271 --> 01:11:49.467
Look, I know it's been
a whirlwind,


1314
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:54.193
but before school starts
and I have to go back to work,


1315
01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:57.247
let's go to Santa Fe
for new year's.


1316
01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:59.609
It's really special there.

1317
01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:09.708
Or... you know,
forget that for now.


1318
01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:12.436
Do you wanna ride in my truck
tomorrow in the parade?


1319
01:12:16.064 --> 01:12:18.630
Hey.

1320
01:12:18.713 --> 01:12:21.562
Hey, what's the matter?

1321
01:12:24.294 --> 01:12:29.908
My wish on the tree,
it came true.


1322
01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:31.007
The world?

1323
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:34.024
I got the job I've always wanted

1324
01:12:34.107 --> 01:12:38.668
and I have to be in New York
on the 26th.


1325
01:12:38.752 --> 01:12:39.868
That means you have to leave...

1326
01:12:39.892 --> 01:12:41.966
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.


1327
01:12:44.166 --> 01:12:45.550
Yeah, well...

1328
01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.955
What was I thinking?

1329
01:12:48.038 --> 01:12:51.727
Of course you have to leave.

1330
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.881
You have a career.

1331
01:12:58.772 --> 01:13:01.051
I'm really happy for you.

1332
01:13:01.093 --> 01:13:02.272
I'm sorry.

1333
01:13:02.356 --> 01:13:04.717
No. No, don't be.

1334
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.017
I'm telling you the same thing
I tell Sean.


1335
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.602
You have to follow your dreams.

1336
01:13:11.686 --> 01:13:14.698
Always do what's in your heart.

1337
01:13:14.742 --> 01:13:16.062
Do you want a ride to the train...

1338
01:13:16.086 --> 01:13:18.318
I am really torn here
and you need to know that.


1339
01:13:18.402 --> 01:13:19.704
Yeah.

1340
01:13:19.788 --> 01:13:26.304
I've waited my whole life
for this job and... you...


1341
01:13:30.418 --> 01:13:31.802
Well, it's...

1342
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.716
I'll be back.

1343
01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.279
We both know that you won't.

1344
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:48.932
I really appreciate everything
you've done for the town


1345
01:13:49.015 --> 01:13:50.927
and for me.

1346
01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:59.728
You got me breathing again.

1347
01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:03.231
Tell Sean...

1348
01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:05.309
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.

1349
01:14:05.392 --> 01:14:07.346
Well, it's late.

1350
01:14:08.931 --> 01:14:10.721
And it's Christmas.

1351
01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.729
Merry Christmas, Caroline.

1352
01:14:18.261 --> 01:14:20.050
Merry Christmas, Oscar.

1353
01:15:00.074 --> 01:15:02.394
Need a ride?

1354
01:15:03.373 --> 01:15:05.490
I was gonna walk.

1355
01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:07.202
Let me give you a ride.

1356
01:15:07.285 --> 01:15:09.239
I'll get my keys.

1357
01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:48.299
You spent all Christmas day
in your room.


1358
01:15:48.383 --> 01:15:50.126
That's not good.

1359
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.081
I'm not in a celebrating mood.

1360
01:15:52.165 --> 01:15:53.181
I figured.

1361
01:15:53.265 --> 01:15:55.626
Why we left you alone.

1362
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:58.640
People all out for the parade.

1363
01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.026
I hope it's a good one.

1364
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:02.019
It's never a good one.

1365
01:16:02.103 --> 01:16:03.935
They last maybe 15 minutes.

1366
01:16:04.019 --> 01:16:07.601
Some old trucks all decorated
with crepe paper as floats.


1367
01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:10.888
Some of the kids from Oscar's
marching band.


1368
01:16:10.929 --> 01:16:13.534
Some dogs dressed up in
their Christmas finest.


1369
01:16:13.617 --> 01:16:14.465
What?

1370
01:16:14.548 --> 01:16:15.770
But I thought...

1371
01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:16.807
You thought it's like the ones
in San Francisco?


1372
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:17.847
No.

1373
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:21.026
It's small, but it's ours.

1374
01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.346
Genuinely ours.

1375
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:25.384
That's what makes it so special.

1376
01:16:25.467 --> 01:16:28.887
But if that's all that it is
why did Camilla send me here?


1377
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:31.658
She knew that you needed
to be here.


1378
01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:33.979
To soak in our Christmas.

1379
01:16:34.063 --> 01:16:37.280
You're not leaving Christmas
behind this time, are you?


1380
01:16:37.363 --> 01:16:40.778
You're taking it with you?

1381
01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:43.792
Absolutely, I'm taking it
with me.


1382
01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:50.107
OK, I have to ask you.

1383
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.614
Are you Santa Claus?

1384
01:16:54.262 --> 01:16:55.238
No.

1385
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.298
Of course not.

1386
01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:57.681
What made you think that?

1387
01:16:57.765 --> 01:16:58.743
Are you kidding?

1388
01:16:58.825 --> 01:17:00.086
Everything!

1389
01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:01.897
You were gone last night
and, according to everyone,


1390
01:17:01.921 --> 01:17:03.018
every Christmas Eve.

1391
01:17:04.645 --> 01:17:08.513
I serve food at the food kitchen
in Dorry every Christmas Eve.


1392
01:17:08.555 --> 01:17:10.997
I do play Santa for the kids.

1393
01:17:20.004 --> 01:17:21.916
Here we are.

1394
01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:25.745
Thank you for the ride.

1395
01:17:25.829 --> 01:17:28.516
Thank you for being here.

1396
01:17:28.599 --> 01:17:31.159
For your talent.

1397
01:17:31.242 --> 01:17:34.784
For honouring our town
with your words.


1398
01:17:34.825 --> 01:17:41.343
For opening yourself up to what
Christmas can be if you let it.


1399
01:17:41.426 --> 01:17:43.647
I know what Christmas
can be now.


1400
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:46.459
Even the magic?

1401
01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.903
Especially the magic.

1402
01:17:48.987 --> 01:17:51.836
Good.

1403
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.873
One more thing.

1404
01:17:54.969 --> 01:17:56.637
Merry Christmas.

1405
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.674
I can't.

1406
01:18:03.034 --> 01:18:04.012
Thank you.

1407
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:06.374
Thank you.

1408
01:18:45.924 --> 01:18:47.878
Not Santa, huh?

1409
01:18:51.749 --> 01:18:53.274
<i>On the 11th post of Christmas</i>

1410
01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:55.494
<i>I wait to leave Carta de Amor.</i>

1411
01:18:55.578 --> 01:18:56.799
<i>If there was ever a town</i>

1412

1413
01:18:59.369 --> 01:19:00.547

1414
01:19:00.631 --> 01:19:02.992
<i>A love letter to its wonderful

<i>Its traditions.</i>

1416
01:19:04.622 --> 01:19:07.106
<i>A huge love letter to Christmas.</i>

1417

I'm taking with me.</i>


1421
01:19:33.778 --> 01:19:35.732
It's Caroline Williams!

1422
01:19:38.016 --> 01:19:39.765
That is awful.

1423
01:19:39.849 --> 01:19:41.965
Congratulations.

1424
01:19:42.048 --> 01:19:43.879
What's going on here?

1425
01:19:43.923 --> 01:19:45.487
Oh, well we're here
for the parade


1426
01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:47.710
that you asked us to come
to see.


1427
01:19:47.793 --> 01:19:48.769
I did?

1428
01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:50.295
You said on your blog you wish

1429
01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:53.737
we could all experience it
for ourselves so we're here.


1430
01:19:53.821 --> 01:19:55.387
I was gonna spend
another Christmas alone


1431
01:19:55.411 --> 01:19:57.282
until you invited me.

1432
01:19:57.365 --> 01:19:59.218
You didn't all come together?

1433
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.724
No.

1434
01:20:00.766 --> 01:20:04.311
You'd better get going or
you're gonna miss the parade.


1435
01:20:07.408 --> 01:20:09.362
Are you coming?

1436
01:20:38.973 --> 01:20:39.990
Hey.

1437
01:20:40.562 --> 01:20:42.759
Where did you buy those antlers?

1438
01:21:36.198 --> 01:21:38.477
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

1439
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.693
Merry Christmas!

1440
01:22:05.624 --> 01:22:08.066
Hey you're late.
Parade's over.


1441
01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:10.429
Merry Christmas!

1442
01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:11.610
Caroline.

1443
01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:12.873
Hi, mister.

1444
01:22:12.956 --> 01:22:14.217
Want a ride?

1445
01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.154
You bet.

1446
01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.476
But give me a second first, OK?

1447
01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:18.944
- OK.
- Alright.


1448
01:22:23.303 --> 01:22:24.931
Can you do me a favour?

1449
01:22:25.789 --> 01:22:27.171
Thank you.

1450
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:33.765
I love that you're here...
What happened?


1451
01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:36.577
I changed my Christmas wish.

1452
01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.452
Your dream job?

1453
01:22:38.535 --> 01:22:41.508
My dream job didn't
include Christmas.


1454
01:22:41.591 --> 01:22:43.989
Or you.

1455
01:22:44.033 --> 01:22:46.394
And that's a deal breaker.

1456
01:22:53.321 --> 01:22:55.797
Oscar, your song.

1457
01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:57.021
But I
