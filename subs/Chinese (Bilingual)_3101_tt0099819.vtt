1
00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.800
保佑我，神父，我有罪。
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.


2
00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:30.972
你好吗?
How are you doing?


3
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.641
距离我上次忏悔已经两周了。
It's been two weeks since my last confession.


4
00:00:33.707 --> 00:00:37.378
那段时间我做了很多坏事。
I've done a lot of bad things in that time.


5
00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:47.445
我不去教堂，我多次徒然地使用上帝的名字，我骂我婆婆，但那是用意大利语说的，所以她听不懂，所以我不知道这算不算。
Didn't go to church, I took the Lord's name in vain quite a few times, I cursed my mother-in-law, but it was in Italian, so she couldn't understand, so I don't know if that counts.


6
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.660
这也算
It counts.


7
00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:57.431
好吧……我背叛了我的妻子。
Okay... And I cheated on my wife.


8
00:00:57.498 --> 00:00:59.767
你犯奸淫了吗?
You committed adultery?


9
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:00.834
是的。
Yes.


10
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:02.336
多少次?
How many times?


11
00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:07.976
在过去两周内已经打了五次了。
Five times the last two weeks.


12
00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:13.081
等待……不,那是错的。
Wait... No, that's wrong.


13
00:01:13.147 --> 00:01:23.147
这星期来了四次……与三个女人…上周有三次…和另外两个女人。
It was four times this week... with three women... and three times last week... with two other women.


14
00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:27.328
哇。
Wow.


15
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:37.395
另外，这周的一个女人和上周一样…或者有两个女人是一样的，所以我想这就…什么?我不知道。七次。
Plus, one of the women from this week was the same as last week... or maybe two of the women was the same, so I guess that makes... What? I don't know. Seven times.


16
00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:42.176
我是说，不止七次了，神父。
I mean, it was more than seven times, Father.


17
00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:52.243
大概有10到12次，但是，你知道，就像……在7个不同的场合，只有5个不同的女人，但有些女人不止一次……有些人还会来好几次。
It was more like 10 or 12 times, but, you know, it was like... on seven different occasions, only with five different women, but some of the women more than once... Some of them quite a few times.


18
00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:02.763
事实上，这很难说，神父。
In fact, it's hard to say, Father.


19
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.538
我没有仔细数过，但过去两周有十几次…多少有出入。
I didn't exactly keep count, but let's say a dozen times in the last two weeks... give or take a few times.


20
00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:00.154
罗莎莉!
Rosalie!


21
00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.640
乔伊，我还在等肉丸呢，宝贝。
Joey, I'm still waiting for those meatballs, baby.


22
00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:20.608
我马上就来。
I'll be right with you.


23
00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:22.643
谢谢你过来。
Hey, thanks for stopping by.


24
00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.351
罗莎莉，温德尔要再来一杯啤酒。
Rosalie, Wendel wants another beer.


25
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.552
原谅我。
Excuse me.


26
00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:35.923
本尼!你在这里做什么?我以为你去度假了。
Benny!What are you doing here? I thought you was on vacation.


27
00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.158
昨天回来。
Got back yesterday.


28
00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:38.792
玛莎怎么样?她是很棒的。
How's Martha? She's terrific.


29
00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.461
帮我转达乔伊的问候。
You tell her Joey said hello.


30
00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:41.929
我会的。
I will.


31
00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:43.997
德沃，肉丸，肉丸。来吧。
Devo, the meatball, the meatballs. Come on.


32
00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.600
我一分钟后就来，伙计们。
I'll be with you in one minute, folks.


33
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.962
唐娜·乔伊，你穿迷你裙真好看。
Donna Joy, you're looking mighty nice in that mini.


34
00:04:15.028 --> 00:04:16.797
谢谢,乔伊。
Thanks, Joey.


35
00:04:16.864 --> 00:04:19.233
你自己看起来也不错。
You're looking pretty good yourself.


36
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.836
是的,你觉得呢?谢谢。
Yeah, you think? Thanks.


37
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.040
乔伊的披萨。
Joey's Pizza.


38
00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:28.976
嘿，泰，你好吗?
Hey, Ty, how you doing?


39
00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:35.483
你想要辣香肠，你有辣香肠。
How many You want pepperoni, you got pepperoni.


40
00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:36.517
德沃，把这个拿出来。
Devo, take this out.


41
00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:37.885
罗莎莉!
Rosalie!


42
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:39.119
图斯基要来拿六个派
Tulsky's coming by to pick up six pies.


43
00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:41.222
我们需要更多的意大利辣香肠。在后面。
We need more pepperoni. It's in the back.


44
00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:46.627
乔伊的披萨。
Joey's Pizza.


45
00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:50.831
嘿，宝贝，你好吗?

46
00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:53.601
哦!
Oh!


47
00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:54.735
不，不，现在很糟糕。
No, no, now's bad.


48
00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:56.370
现在是不好的。
Now's bad.


49
00:04:56.437 --> 00:04:58.706
很忙。
Very busy.


50
00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.208
以后怎么样?
How about later on?


51
00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:02.042
稍后。好吗?
Later on. Okay?


52
00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:03.677
我得挂电话了。我妻子的到来。
I've got to hang up. My wife's coming.


53
00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:04.812
好吧,再见。
Okay, bye.


54
00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:06.680
谢谢你打来电话。
Thanks for calling.


55
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:11.519
安静点，好吗?
Be quiet, will you?


56
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:12.653
闭嘴!
Shut up!


57
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.954
嗨,妈妈。嗨,妈妈。
Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom.


58
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:15.122
多米尼克。
Dominic.


59
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.426
Devo。
Devo.


60
00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:21.429
“克里斯托尔先生，让它发光吧。
"Mr. Crystal, let it shine.


61
00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:25.466
像豪猪一样的尖刺。”
Spikes just like a porcupine."


62
00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.667
你好,你们两个。
Hello, you two.


63
00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.101
这就跟你问声好！
Hi!


64
00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:29.069
这是热的。我马上就来。
This is hot. I'll be with you in a minute.


65
00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:30.371
我要把这个给你。
I'm going to drop this off.


66
00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:33.407
好的。我要去看爸爸。
Okay. I'm going to go see Dad.


67
00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:34.742
嗨,爸爸。
Hi, Daddy.


68
00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:36.310
谁说的?
Who said that?


69
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:38.612
什么
What


70
00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:43.317
让我看看你的照片，多姆。
Let me see your picture, Dom.


71
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:46.086
哦，那真是太好了。它是什么?
Oh, that's really good. What is it?


72
00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:47.521
它看起来像什么?
What does it look like?


73
00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:49.223
看起来像披萨饼?
It looks like a pizza pie?


74
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.058
妈妈，这是一朵花。
Mom, it's a flower.


75
00:05:51.124 --> 00:05:52.560
哦,我很抱歉。
Oh, I'm sorry.


76
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.030
你觉得呢?
What do you think?


77
00:05:57.097 --> 00:05:59.066
米开朗基罗。
Michelangelo.


78
00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:01.201
看看这个。
Look at that.


79
00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:33.667
噢，正义的捍卫者。你好。
Oh, the defenders of justice. Hello.


80
00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:40.173
哦。滚开，警察们!
Uh-oh. Cheese it, the cops!


81
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:43.477
给你，拉里。所有的设置。
Here you go, Larry. All set.


82
00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:45.212
香肠和“房间”，重“房间”。
Sausage and 'rooms, heavy on the 'rooms.


83
00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.848
谢谢你,乔伊。
Thank you, Joey.


84
00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:49.283
卡洛斯，怎么了?
Carlos, what's the matter?


85
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.451
什么都没有。
Nothing.


86
00:06:50.518 --> 00:06:51.785
嘿，孩子们，你们好吗?
Hey, kids, how's it going?


87
00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:52.920
好的。
Okay.


88
00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:55.188
拉里,拉里,拉里。
Larry, Larry, Larry.


89
00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:56.990
看看多米尼克今天干的好事
Look what Dominic did today.


90
00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:58.526
你见过这么美的东西吗?
You ever see anything so beautiful?


91
00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:02.630
多米尼克,可爱。那是什么，一朵花吗?
Dominic, that's lovely. What is that, a flower?


92
00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:04.197
不，是披萨。
No, it's a pizza.


93
00:07:04.264 --> 00:07:06.534
我猜是意大利辣香肠。
It's pepperoni, I bet.


94
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.337
是的，有可能。我不确定。是的。
Yeah, it could be. I'm not sure. Yeah.


95
00:07:09.403 --> 00:07:11.138
我爱意大利辣香肠。
I love pepperoni.


96
00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:12.272
下一个时间。
Next time.


97
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.341
你总是说下次。
You always say next time.


98
00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:17.110
我听说你抓住了那个抢劫7- 11便利店的家伙。
I heard you caught that guy who was robbing all them 7-Elevens.


99
00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:18.379
你抓住那家伙了?
You caught that guy?


100
00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:19.447
正确的。
Right.


101
00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:20.814
昨晚把他接走了。
Picked him up last night.


102
00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:21.949
感谢上帝!
Thank God!


103
00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:22.816
你做得很好。
You're doing a great job.


104
00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:25.052
你听到了吗?
You hear that?


105
00:07:25.118 --> 00:07:32.893
这就是为什么在美国，我们生活安全，生活美好，因为我们有拉里·斯库纳(Larry Schooner)和卡洛斯·威利(Carlos Wiley)这样的警察，他们确保每个人都做自己该做的事。
That's how come, in America, we live safe, have a good life, because we've got cops like Larry Schooner and Carlos Wiley who make sure everybody does what he's supposed to do.


106
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.665
你努力工作，纳税，遵守法律，你可以得到你想要的任何东西。
You work hard, pay taxes, obey the law, you can have anything you want.


107
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:41.569
我想让我的孩子们明白我们的国家是多么伟大。
I want my kids to understand what a great country we've got here.


108
00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.372
我想他们能理解。
I think they understand.


109
00:08:03.924 --> 00:08:05.793
罗莎莉，盯着店里。
Hey, Rosalie, keep your eye on the shop.


110
00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:07.695
我得去看看莱西·弗林的水管。
I've got to look at Lacey Flynn's plumbing.


111
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:10.130
好吧,亲爱的。
Okay, sweetie.


112
00:08:10.197 --> 00:08:11.399
她的管道吗?
Her plumbing?


113
00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:16.269
德沃，你那边完事后，我要你到后面去清理一下垃圾桶。
Devo, when you're done there, I want you to go around back and clean out the garbage cans.


114
00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:18.772
它们满是蛆虫。
They're full of maggots.


115
00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:24.144
蛆虫。这是完美的。我爱那个男人。
Maggots. That's perfect. I love that man.


116
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:25.546
别担心。我和你一起做。
Don't worry. I'll do it with you.


117
00:08:25.613 --> 00:08:28.081
不，拜托，那是我的工作，照顾蛆虫。
No, please, that's my job, taking care of maggots.


118
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.152
你过得如何?
How you doing?


119
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:35.689
你过得如何?
How you doing?


120
00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:51.705
这是这周他第三次去看莱西的管道了。
This is the third time this week he's gone up there to visit Lacey's pipes.


121
00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:53.641
拜托，他是这栋楼的主人。
Come on, he owns the building.


122
00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.275
他得处理好这件事。
He has to take care of it.


123
00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:56.677
看到她看他的眼神了吗?
See the way she looks at him?


124
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:58.546
这不是他的错。
That's not his fault.


125
00:08:58.612 --> 00:09:00.714
除此之外,她是孤独的。我为她感到难过。
Besides, she's lonely. I feel sorry for her.


126
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:02.182
不要为她感到难过。
Don't feel sorry for her.


127
00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:04.217
这对乔伊来说太方便了。
It's too convenient for Joey.


128
00:09:04.284 --> 00:09:06.153
嘿，你不应该那样说话。
Hey, you shouldn't talk like that.


129
00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:07.320
它是不正确的。
It's not right.


130
00:09:07.387 --> 00:09:08.889
乔伊是我的丈夫。
Joey's my husband.


131
00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:11.324
我不想看到你受伤。
I don't want to see you get hurt.


132
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:14.828
我能照顾好自己。别担心我。
I can take care of myself. Don't worry about me.


133
00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:24.605
是谁?
Who is it?


134
00:09:24.672 --> 00:09:27.040
是送披萨的。
It's the pizza man.


135
00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:28.442
你好,披萨的人。
Hello, pizza man.


136
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:29.643
你好。
Hello.


137
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.878
我来检查你的管道。
I'm here to check your pipes.


138
00:09:30.944 --> 00:09:33.213
我真高兴，水喷得到处都是。
I'm so glad because water's squirting everywhere.


139
00:09:34.915 --> 00:09:37.350
觉得她漂亮吗?
Think she's pretty?


140
00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:40.454
是的，我想是的。
Yeah, I guess so.


141
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.859
我有眼睛，你知道吗?
I've got eyes, you know?


142
00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:49.563
我知道很多女孩都为乔伊疯狂，而且他对女人也很有眼光。
I can see a lot of girls are crazy for Joey, and he has an eye for the ladies too.


143
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.299
没关系。他是意大利人。他可以看。
That's okay. He's Italian. He's allowed to look.


144
00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:55.703
在现实中，我们知道，有些男人做的不仅仅是看。
In reality as we know it, some men do more than look.


145
00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:59.607
你不相信任何人，德沃。这就是你的全部麻烦。
You don't trust anyone, Devo. That's your whole trouble.


146
00:09:59.673 --> 00:10:00.908
我相信你。
I trust you.


147
00:10:00.974 --> 00:10:04.277
乔伊绝不会背叛我的。
Joey would never run around on me.


148
00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:06.514
罗莎莉——他永远不会。
Rosalie-- He never would.


149
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.815
让我这么说吧。
Let me put it this way.


150
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:12.385
假设你做了一个他做的梦，而这个梦被证明是真的。
Let's say you had a dream that he did, and the dream turned out to be true.


151
00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:14.622
你会怎么做?
What would you do?


152
00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:18.325
我会自杀的，如果我感觉不好，我会杀了他。
I'd kill myself, and if I didn't feel any better, I'd kill him.


153
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:19.627
是的。
Yeah.


154
00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:30.571
乔伊，再待一会儿。
Joey, stay a little longer.


155
00:10:30.638 --> 00:10:32.472
哦,我不能。我有很多工作要做。
Oh, I can't. I've got a lot of work.


156
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.707
也许你过会儿再来?
Maybe you'll come back later?


157
00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:34.875
可能过几天吧。
Maybe later.


158
00:10:34.942 --> 00:10:36.143
也许在这里过夜?
Maybe even spend the night?


159
00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:38.178
你疯了吗?
What are you, crazy?


160
00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:40.380
我不能在这儿过夜。
I can't spend the night.


161
00:10:40.447 --> 00:10:42.816
我有妻子和家庭。
I've got a wife and family.


162
00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:45.052
乔伊，你不爱你的妻子。
Joey, you don't love your wife.


163
00:10:45.118 --> 00:10:46.620
谁说?
Who says so?


164
00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.121
我当然爱她。
Of course I love her.


165
00:10:48.188 --> 00:10:51.058
我跟你做爱不代表我不爱她。
Just because I make love to you doesn't mean I don't love her.


166
00:10:51.124 --> 00:10:53.193
那是什么样的婚姻?
What kind of marriage is that?


167
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.762
这是一段美好的婚姻。
It's a good marriage.


168
00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:56.730
我买菜，她做饭。
I buy the food, she cooks it.


169
00:10:56.797 --> 00:10:58.298
我可以为你做饭。
I can cook for you.


170
00:10:58.365 --> 00:11:00.901
你不能给我做饭。你不是我妻子。
You can't cook for me. You're not my wife.


171
00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:02.335
你甚至都不是意大利人。
You're not even Italian.


172
00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:03.704
你妻子也不是。
Neither is your wife.


173
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:06.640
她是欧亚混血什么的。
She's some kind of Eurasian or something.


174
00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:09.276
不，她不是那里的人。
No, she's not from there.


175
00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:11.845
她她妈妈是南斯拉夫人
She's-- Her mother's from Yugoslavia.


176
00:11:11.912 --> 00:11:13.947
这是一个天主教国家。就在意大利旁边。
It's a good Catholic country. Right next to Italy.


177
00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:15.816
事实上，它曾经是意大利的一部分。
In fact, it used to be part of Italy.


178
00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:17.217
我认为。
I think.


179
00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:20.353
乔伊，这里不是意大利。这里是美国。
Joey, this isn't Italy. This is America.


180
00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:28.128
嘿，美洲是一个意大利人发现的，它是以另一个意大利人的名字命名的。
Hey, America was discovered by one Italian, and it's named after another.


181
00:11:28.195 --> 00:11:30.964
那又怎样?那能证明什么呢?
So what? What does that prove?


182
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:32.700
这证明美国是一个意大利国家。
It proves that America is an Italian country.


183
00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.067
我得走了。
I've got to go.


184
00:11:34.134 --> 00:11:37.437
乔伊，如果你是个虔诚的天主教徒，为什么还要通奸?
Joey, if you're such a good Catholic, why do you commit adultery?


185
00:11:37.504 --> 00:11:38.672
我一个人。
I'm a man.


186
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.008
我体内有很多荷尔蒙。
I've got a lot of hormones in my body.


187
00:11:41.074 --> 00:11:43.543
他跳得那么高，高，高*
* He jumped So high, high, high *

*直到7月4日*
* Till The Fourth of July-ly-ly *


190
00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:50.050
好了，又来了。
Okay, here we go again.


191
00:11:50.117 --> 00:11:52.886
最后一次。一个,两个,三个。
Last time. One, two, three.


192
00:11:52.953 --> 00:11:56.023
*玛丽小姐，麦克，麦克，麦克*穿着黑色，黑色，黑色*
* Miss Mary Mac, Mac, Mac * All dressed In black, black, black *

195
00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.294
她问她的妈妈，妈妈，妈妈
* She asked Her mother, mother, mother *


196
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.632
为50美分，美分，美分*看大象大象，大象*
* For 50 cents, cents, cents * To watch the elephants Elephants, elephants *


197
00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:06.834
*跳过栅栏，栅栏，栅栏*
* Jump over The fence, fence, fence *


198
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.468
他们跳得那么高，高，高*
* They jumped So high, high, high *


199
00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:11.672
*他们击中天空，天空，天空*没有回来，回来，回来*
* They hit the sky, sky, sky * And didn't come Back, back, back *


200
00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:13.641
*直到7月4日*
* Till The Fourth of July-ly-ly *


201
00:12:13.707 --> 00:12:15.542
然后他们开始担心，担心，担心
* Then they got Worried, worried, worried *


202
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.277
*去了香港，香港，香港*
* And went To Hong Kong, Kong, Kong *


203
00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:19.179
*去看《金刚，金刚，金刚》*
* To see The King Kong, Kong, Kong *


204
00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:20.814
为了得到他的建议，邪恶，邪恶
* To get His advice, vice, vice *


205
00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:22.382
但是他没有，没有，没有
* But he didn't have Any, any, any *


206
00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:24.117
所以他们回家，回家，回家*
* So they went Back home, home, home *


207
00:12:24.184 --> 00:12:28.088
他们没有得到任何建议——这是一种恶习
* They didn't get any Advice-vice-vice *


208
00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:30.590
所以他们去了罗马，罗马，罗马
* So they went To Rome, Rome, Rome *


209
00:12:30.658 --> 00:12:33.727
*没有回家，回家，回家…＊
* And didn't come Home, home, home... *


210
00:12:37.364 --> 00:12:39.733
罗莎莉，听我说。
Rosalie, listen to this.


211
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.204
这上面说有个女人被自己家的植物活活吃掉了。
It says here some woman was eaten alive by her own houseplants.


212
00:12:44.271 --> 00:12:45.673
你能想象吗?
Can you imagine?


213
00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:47.841
妈妈，还要咖啡吗?
Mama, want more coffee?


214
00:12:47.908 --> 00:12:49.777
如果没有，我就把它扔了。
If not, I'm going to throw it out.


215
00:12:49.843 --> 00:12:51.411
哦,不。去做吧。把它扔出去。
Oh, no. Go ahead. Throw it out.


216
00:12:51.478 --> 00:12:56.149
否则我整晚都得在厕所里。
Otherwise, I'll be in the bathroom all night.


217
00:12:56.216 --> 00:13:03.323
还记得你父亲每晚睡前都要喝一大杯黑咖啡吗?
Remember how your father used to drink a big cup of black coffee every night right before bed?


218
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.692
是的，也很热。
Yeah, boiling hot too.


219
00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:06.994
有四个糖。
With four sugars.


220
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.296
非常甜的。
Very sweet.


221
00:13:09.362 --> 00:13:10.563
就像他。
Just like him.


222
00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:16.804
你知道的…我每天都想他。
You know... I miss him every day.


223
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.973
我几乎忘记了我讨厌他的一切。
I forget almost everything I hate about him.


224
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.909
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.


225
00:13:21.975 --> 00:13:24.812
我也想他。
I miss him too.


226
00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.246
我得到了它。
I got it.


227
00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:03.984
他跳得那么高，高，高，他撞到了天空，天空，天空*
* He jumped so high, high, high He hit the sky, sky, sky *


228
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:05.652
嘿,Devo。
Hey, Devo.


229
00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:06.619
你好。
Hello.


230
00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:07.855
进来吧。你过得如何?
Come on in. How you doing?


231
00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:09.489
我做的很好。
I'm doing good.


232
00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:12.192
我正准备看完球赛呢。
I was just going to catch the end of the ball game.


233
00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:13.460
想看吗?
Want to watch?


234
00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:15.328
不用了，谢谢。
Oh, no, thank you.


235
00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:17.831
我想我会去拜访罗莎莉和娜佳妈妈。
I think I'll visit with Rosalie and Mama Nadja.


236
00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:19.967
确定。
Sure.


237
00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:21.201
他们在厨房里。
They're in the kitchen.


238
00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:23.303
谢谢你！
Thank you.


239
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:30.177
我该怎么办?
What do I do?


240
00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:32.545
你从袋子里拿出一个符文。
You reach in the bag and take out a rune.


241
00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:33.947
任何一个吗?
Any one?


242
00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:37.084
它们都很漂亮，你等着瞧吧。
Well, they're all beautiful, you'll see.


243
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.152
它们是什么，符文吗?
What are they, runes?


244
00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:42.022
它们是石头，非常有灵性
They're stones. They're very spiritual.


245
00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.190
他们有超自然的力量。
They have metaphysical powers.


246
00:14:43.256 --> 00:14:44.291
他们做了什么?
And what do they do?


247
00:14:44.357 --> 00:14:47.995
它不会说，他们会告诉你你在哪里。
It wouldn't say-- Well, they tell you where you're at.


248
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:48.962
我在家里。
I'm at home.


249
00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:50.697
我们在这里。
We're right here.


250
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:51.799
你在说什么?
What are you saying?


251
00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:53.233
不,在精神上。
No, spiritually.


252
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.602
在精神上，它们告诉你你在哪里。
Spiritually, they tell you where you're at.


253
00:14:55.668 --> 00:14:57.537
我不知道该不该这么做。
I don't know if I should do this.


254
00:14:57.604 --> 00:14:58.872
我是说，我是天主教徒。
I mean, I'm a Catholic.


255
00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:00.540
他们并不反对上帝或其他什么。
They're not against God or anything.


256
00:15:00.607 --> 00:15:03.476
去做吧。试一试。有什么坏处呢?
Go ahead. Try it. What can it hurt?


257
00:15:03.543 --> 00:15:05.178
好的。
Okay.


258
00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:11.551
哦，这个不错。我喜欢这个。
Oh, this is a good one. I love this one.


259
00:15:11.618 --> 00:15:13.220
这是力量。
This is strength.


260
00:15:13.286 --> 00:15:14.587
力量?
Strength?


261
00:15:14.654 --> 00:15:15.789
是的。
Yes.


262
00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:19.359
快攻!快攻!
Fast break! Fast break!


263
00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:20.560
看上去不错。
Looking good.


264
00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:23.763
是的!是的!
Yes! Yes!


265
00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:30.838
*……意思是不要忘记你是我的爱人
* ...means don't forget You are my darling *


266
00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:38.511
"更替和更新的符文，"暗示是时候改变你现在的生活了"
"The rune of replacement and renewal, "suggesting that the time has come to change the life you're living."


267
00:15:38.578 --> 00:15:40.247
它没有这么说。让我看看。
It doesn't say that. Let me see.


268
00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:42.082
确定它。看。
Sure it does. Look.


269
00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.650
你以为我瞎编的吗?
Think I made that up?


270
00:15:43.716 --> 00:15:45.118
不，但我了解你。
No, but I know you.


271
00:15:45.185 --> 00:15:46.453
我知道你在想什么。
I know what you think.


272
00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:49.056
罗莎莉，给我拿瓶啤酒，好吗?
Rosalie, bring me a beer, will you?


273
00:15:51.024 --> 00:15:52.960
我觉得你应该让他自己去买啤酒。
I think you should let him get his own beer.


274
00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:57.030
我不介意。他努力工作。我喜欢照顾他。
I don't mind. He works hard. I like taking care of him.


275
00:15:57.097 --> 00:15:59.299
有一件事叫做妇女解放。
There's such a thing as women's liberation.


276
00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:00.834
她不需要做奴隶。
She doesn't have to be a slave.


277
00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:02.035
这是正确的。
That's right.


278
00:16:02.102 --> 00:16:06.940
上周在电视上，我听说有个女人捅了她丈夫27刀。
Last week on TV, I heard about a woman who stabbed her husband 27 times.


279
00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:10.310
你知道为什么吗?因为他拒绝把芥末罐的盖子放回去。
You know why? Because he refused to put the top back on the mustard jar.


280
00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:12.645
是的,27倍。
Yeah, 27 times.


281
00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:14.581
你能想象吗?
Can you imagine?


282
00:16:14.647 --> 00:16:18.018
有花生或椒盐卷饼之类的东西可以嚼吗?
We got any peanuts or pretzels, something to munch on?


283
00:16:18.085 --> 00:16:19.887
不，我想我们完了。
No, I think we're out.


284
00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:21.621
我们总是出去。
We're always out.


285
00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:24.057
在我妈妈家，总是有很多食物可以吃。
My mama's house, there's always plenty food to eat.


286
00:16:24.124 --> 00:16:25.425
也许你该和你妈妈一起住。
Maybe you should live with your mama.


287
00:16:25.492 --> 00:16:26.459
不要讽刺。
Don't be sarcastic.


288
00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:27.594
别逼我。
Don't be a nudge.


289
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.795
别叫我助推器。
Don't call me that nudge thing.


290
00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:31.498
来吧。我是意大利人。我喜欢吃。
Come on. I'm Italian. I like to eat.


291
00:16:31.564 --> 00:16:32.966
我是南斯拉夫人。
I'm Yugoslavian.


292
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.567
我不喜欢做饭，尤其不喜欢做嫩鸡。
I don't like to cook, especially for nudges.


293
00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:36.503
是啊，别叫我傻逼。
Yeah, don't call me a nudge.


294
00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:38.972
轻推,推,推。
Nudge, nudge, nudge.


295
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:40.874
把那双鞋给我。
Give me those shoes.


296
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.609
你今晚又要出去吗?
You going out again tonight?


297
00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:43.843
嘿，罗莎莉，快点。
Hey, Rosalie, come on.


298
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:45.478
什么?我什么也没说。
What? I haven't said anything.


299
00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:48.115
我每天都工作。一整天。好吧?每一天。
I work every day. All day. Okay? Every day.


300
00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:52.185
晚上，我喜欢放松，出去玩，你知道的。
At night, I like to relax, go out, have fun, you know.


301
00:16:52.252 --> 00:16:53.653
我以为你待在家里。
I thought you were staying home.


302
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.289
对什么?
What for?


303
00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:58.425
对什么?
What for?


304
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:00.260
我不知道。
I don't know.


305
00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:04.231
谁知道呢?
Who knows?


306
00:17:04.297 --> 00:17:06.766
嗯,像什么?
Well, like what?


307
00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:10.370
首先，我们有文书工作。
Well, for one thing, we've got paperwork.


308
00:17:10.437 --> 00:17:12.805
文书工作吗?
Paperwork?


309
00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:16.944
每月的账单，保险，抵押贷款，电话费。
The monthly bills, the insurance, the mortgage, the phone bill.


310
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.611
我要出去。
I'm going out.


311
00:17:18.678 --> 00:17:23.483
*玛丽·麦克小姐，麦克，麦克*在迪斯科舞厅Theque, Theque *
* Miss Mary Mac, Mac, Mac * At the discotheque Theque, theque *


312
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:29.222
*我要抓住她，她，她*在她的背上，背上，背上……＊
* I'm going to get her, her, her * Down on Her back, back, back... *


313
00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:49.176
请伏特加。
Vodka, please.


314
00:18:01.821 --> 00:18:02.889
米奇，这都怪我。
Mickey, that's on me.


315
00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.657
没问题，乔伊。
You got it, Joey.


316
00:18:04.724 --> 00:18:07.560
我叫乔伊·博卡。
Joey Boca's my name.


317
00:18:07.627 --> 00:18:09.062
你知道吗?
And you know what?


318
00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:10.730
我知道你的一些事。
I know something about you.


319
00:18:10.797 --> 00:18:12.865
是吗?你对我了解多少?
Yeah? What do you know about me?


320
00:18:12.932 --> 00:18:15.435
我知道你以前从没来过这里。
I know you never been in here before in your life.


321
00:18:15.502 --> 00:18:17.804
真的可能是吧。
Really Maybe I have.


322
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.273
如果你说了，我早就知道了。
If you had, I would have known about it.


323
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.574
人们会谈论它。
People would have talked about it.


324
00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:26.046
比如"乔伊，你看"那天晚上这里面是什么?
Like, "Joey, you see "what was in here the other night?


325
00:18:26.113 --> 00:18:27.114
天哪，真是个美人。”
My God, what a beauty."


326
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.149
这是真的。
It's true.


327
00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:31.985
不，像你这样的人不常来。
No, someone like you doesn't come around that often.


328
00:18:32.052 --> 00:18:33.286
这就像一个全国性的节日。
It's like a national holiday.


329
00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:34.454
明白我的意思吗?
Know what I mean?


330
00:18:34.521 --> 00:18:36.556
你不会忘记的。
You don't forget it.


331
00:18:42.695 --> 00:18:46.966
谢谢你请我喝酒，但我有伴了。
Listen, I appreciate the drink, but I'm with someone.


332
00:18:47.034 --> 00:18:48.068
非常幸运的人。
Someone very lucky.


333
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:50.737
我希望我也能那么幸运。
I wish I could be that lucky.


334
00:18:50.803 --> 00:18:57.544
我看着你，对自己说，天哪，能和这个女人走在一起的男人一定觉得自己是人间之王
I look at you and I say to myself, "My God, the man who gets to walk "with this woman must feel like a king on earth."


335
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.780
这是给你。
Here's to you.


336
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:10.723
我想我最好回去了。
I guess I'd better get back.


337
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.559
让我看看你的男朋友。
Show me your boyfriend.


338
00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:19.566
我想亲眼看看他，这样我的余生就能希望我是他了。
I want to see him with my own eyes, so I can spend the rest of my life wishing I was him.


339
00:19:22.502 --> 00:19:24.504
他坐在角落里。
He's sitting in the corner.


340
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:25.605
在那里。
Over there.


341
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.712
不是穿黄色衬衫的那个吗?
Not the one in the yellow shirt?


342
00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:33.946
是的,就是他。
Yeah, that's him.


343
00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:36.015
不。
No.


344
00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:36.949
是的。
Yeah.


345
00:19:37.016 --> 00:19:37.950
不。
No.


346
00:19:38.017 --> 00:19:39.986
是的,就是他。
Yeah, that's him.


347
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:41.521
为什么?
Why?


348
00:19:41.588 --> 00:19:51.588
你指望我相信像你这样的美女，一个任何男人都愿意和她在一起的女人，会和这样的人在一起吗?
You expect me to believe that a beauty like you, a woman any man would die to be with, is throwing herself away on someone like that?


349
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.568
你可以拥有任何人。任何人。
You could have anyone. Anyone.


350
00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:59.038
你为什么要带走他?
Why would you take him?


351
00:19:59.106 --> 00:20:00.740
他不是我男朋友什么的。
He's not my boyfriend or anything.


352
00:20:00.807 --> 00:20:03.676
我只是和他一起来的。
I just came here with him.


353
00:20:03.743 --> 00:20:06.979
我并没有爱上他什么的。
I'm not in love with him or anything.


354
00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:14.254
当然不是。你怎么可能?
Of course not. How could you be?


355
00:21:23.923 --> 00:21:26.459
他到底要不要看?
Is he going to watch or what?


356
00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:27.927
你觉得困扰吗?
Does it bother you?


357
00:21:27.994 --> 00:21:30.263
我是意大利人，你知道的。
Well, I'm Italian, you know.


358
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.933
我不能和一个有德国牧羊犬的女人做爱。
I can't make love to a woman with a German shepherd in the room.


359
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.568
这对他来说很尴尬。
It's awkward for him.


360
00:21:35.635 --> 00:21:37.404
你不能吗?
You can't?


361
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.682
原谅我。
Excuse me.


362
00:21:49.749 --> 00:21:51.150
给你。
Here you go.


363
00:21:51.218 --> 00:21:53.420
好啊!。
Attaboy.


364
00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:58.358
再会,亨氏。
Auf Wiedersehen, Heinz.


365
00:22:03.796 --> 00:22:05.232
我想不出来。
I can't figure it out.


366
00:22:05.298 --> 00:22:10.169
像你这样年轻英俊的小伙子，怎么老是和罗莎莉在一起?
A young, good-looking guy like you, how come you're always hanging out with Rosalie?


367
00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:12.805
我喜欢她的陪伴。
I enjoy her company.


368
00:22:12.872 --> 00:22:15.041
你不是要和我妻子同居吧?
You're not moving in on my wife?


369
00:22:15.107 --> 00:22:19.011
不，当然不是。你在开玩笑吧?
No, of course not. What are you, kidding?


370
00:22:19.078 --> 00:22:20.347
这是可笑的。
That's ludicrous.


371
00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:22.215
你是荒谬的。
You're being ridiculous.


372
00:22:22.282 --> 00:22:23.916
可笑的是什么?
What's ridiculous?


373
00:22:23.983 --> 00:22:25.051
没有人能比得上罗莎莉。
There's nobody like Rosalie.


374
00:22:25.117 --> 00:22:26.085
正确的。
Right.


375
00:22:26.152 --> 00:22:27.119
她是最好的。
She's the best.


376
00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:28.455
完全正确。
Exactly.


377
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:29.222
我不敢相信你会这么说。
I can't believe you're saying that.


378
00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:32.492
为什么不呢?她是我的妻子。
Why not? She's my wife.


379
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.928
是的,我知道。我看着别的女人。
Yeah, I know. I look at other women.


380
00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:38.631
好的。那又怎样?这很自然。
Okay. So what? That's only natural.


381
00:22:38.698 --> 00:22:39.899
我是一个人。
I'm a human man.


382
00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.534
这不会伤害罗莎莉。
It don't hurt Rosalie.


383
00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:43.303
你怎么能这么说?
How can you say that?


384
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.605
就算她知道，她也不在乎。
Even if she knows, she don't care.


385
00:22:45.672 --> 00:22:46.973
她就是这样的人。
That's how she is.


386
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.174
哦,是吗?
Oh yeah?


387
00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:50.142
这是纯粹的投影。
Well, that's pure projection.


388
00:22:50.209 --> 00:22:51.411
纯粹的什么?
Pure what?


389
00:22:51.478 --> 00:22:52.912
投影。
Projection.


390
00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:55.748
这是投影，你想怎么想。
It's projection, what you want to think.


391
00:22:55.815 --> 00:22:57.183
我想怎么想?
What I want to think?


392
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.421
是啊，一想到她开心你就觉得很开心。
Yeah, it makes you feel good to think that she's happy.


393
00:23:01.488 --> 00:23:03.323
是啊!
Yeah!


394
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.059
只要她开心，我就开心。
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.


395
00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:09.496
我很高兴我们能相互理解。
I'm glad we understand each other.


396
00:23:09.562 --> 00:23:12.932
嗯,我也是。
Well, me too.


397
00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:15.668
我听说斯宾诺去贝灵汉了?
I hear Spino took off to Bellingham?


398
00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:17.470
是的。
Yeah.


399
00:23:17.537 --> 00:23:18.538
是吗?
Yeah?


400
00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:19.572
我得走了，伙计。
Got to go, man.


401
00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:21.173
好了，别紧张，比利。
Okay, take it easy, Billy.


402
00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:30.517
你怎么认识这些怪人的?
How do you know these weird people?


403
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:34.053
那家伙和我哥哥一起在监狱里。
That guy was in prison with my brother.


404
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.655
我第一个男朋友有一辆哈雷摩托。
My first boyfriend had a Harley.


405
00:23:35.722 --> 00:23:37.790
罗科·雅各布斯。
Rocco Jacobs.


406
00:23:39.926 --> 00:23:43.830
他真是个了不起的人。
What a piece of work he was.


407
00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:45.432
我们过去走得很快。
We used to go fast.


408
00:23:45.498 --> 00:23:47.600
也许我应该买辆自行车。
Maybe I should get a bike.


409
00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:52.972
当然。为什么不呢?让女孩们发疯。
Sure. Why not? Drives the girls crazy.


410
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.674
那时候我很狂野。
I was wild back then.


411
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:57.544
那么Rocco怎么了?
So what happened to Rocco?


412
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.011
乔伊博卡发生。
Joey Boca happened.


413
00:23:59.078 --> 00:24:00.847
他说:“嘿，我是乔伊。你想出去吗?
He said, "Hey, I'm Joey. You want to go out?


414
00:24:00.913 --> 00:24:02.949
你和那个混蛋在一起做什么?”
What are you doing with that jerk?"


415
00:24:05.718 --> 00:24:08.455
我一看到乔伊，就知道他就是我的真命天子。
As soon as I saw Joey, I knew he was the one.


416
00:24:08.521 --> 00:24:09.756
这么快?
So fast?


417
00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:10.957
当然,快。
Sure, fast.


418
00:24:11.023 --> 00:24:12.459
我做我感觉的事。
I do what I feel.


419
00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:14.026
那你一定想自杀。
Then you must have felt suicidal.


420
00:24:14.093 --> 00:24:18.197
闭嘴。
Shut up.


421
00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:24.136
总有一天，你会找到一个很棒的女人，你会用这辆大摩托车把她逼疯。
Some day, you're going to find a wonderful woman, and you'll drive her crazy with this big motorcycle.


422
00:24:24.203 --> 00:24:27.173
我找到了一个很好的女人，但她已经结婚了。
I found myself a wonderful woman, but she's married.


423
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:30.810
德沃，你对我的自尊有好处。
Devo, you're good for my ego.


424
00:24:30.877 --> 00:24:32.545
你得去认识和你年龄相仿的人。
You've got to meet somebody your own age.


425
00:24:32.612 --> 00:24:34.080
为什么?
Why?


426
00:24:34.146 --> 00:24:36.115
你的心不知道你的年龄。
Your heart doesn't know how old you are.


427
00:24:36.182 --> 00:24:37.450
你好。乔伊在吗?
Hi. Is Joey around?


428
00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:38.985
不,他不是。
No, he's not.


429
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.220
我是他的妻子。我能帮你吗?
I'm his wife. Can I help you?


430
00:24:41.287 --> 00:24:48.828
哦……我在一个保龄球馆认识他的，他告诉我他有几套公寓要出租。
Oh... I met him at a bowling alley, and he told me he had some apartments to rent.


431
00:24:48.895 --> 00:24:49.862
他现在就在上面。
He's up there right now.


432
00:24:49.929 --> 00:24:51.664
修复管道。
Fixing the pipes.


433
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:53.400
这是我的朋友，德沃。
This is my friend, Devo.


434
00:24:53.466 --> 00:24:55.034
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?


435
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:56.503
布丽姬特。
Bridget.


436
00:24:56.569 --> 00:24:57.537
布丽姬特。
Bridget.


437
00:24:57.604 --> 00:24:58.538
布丽姬特,Devo见面。
Bridget, meet Devo.


438
00:24:58.605 --> 00:24:59.772
嗨。
Hi.


439
00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:01.040
你好。
Hello.


440
00:25:01.107 --> 00:25:05.111
来吧。我带你上去。
Come on. I'll take you up.


441
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:12.619
我想我是时候搬出我的房子了。
I think it's time I was moving out of my house.


442
00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:14.887
我搬出去的时候和你差不多大。
I was about your age when I moved out.


443
00:25:14.954 --> 00:25:16.489
我和乔伊结婚了。
I got married to Joey.


444
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.590
现在我妈妈和我们住在一起。
Now my mother lives with us.


445
00:25:17.657 --> 00:25:18.858
那一定很有趣。
That must be fun.


446
00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:20.159
没关系。
It's okay.


447
00:25:20.226 --> 00:25:21.694
乔伊来了。
Oh, here's Joey now.


448
00:25:21.761 --> 00:25:26.365
布丽奇特，你好吗?你在这里做什么?
Bridget, how you doing? What are you doing here?


449
00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:29.402
她想看看其中一间公寓，宝贝。
She wants to look at one of the apartments, baby.


450
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:30.302
今天好吗?
Today?


451
00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:31.738
你们有空房吗?
Do you have any vacancies?


452
00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:34.941
我们下个月可能会有一个。
We might have one coming up next month.


453
00:25:35.007 --> 00:25:37.109
趁她还在，不妨去看看。
Might as well take a look while she's here.


454
00:25:37.176 --> 00:25:39.512
是的，是的。
Yeah, yeah.


455
00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:40.613
不。
No.


456
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.950
不，现在不是时候。
No, it's-- It's not a good time.


457
00:25:44.016 --> 00:25:45.485
可能明天吧。这是怎么回事?
Maybe tomorrow. How's that?


458
00:25:45.552 --> 00:25:47.420
当然。明天。
Sure. Tomorrow.


459
00:25:47.487 --> 00:25:49.255
很高兴见到你，博卡太太。
Well, it was nice to meet you, Mrs. Boca.


460
00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:51.123
罗莎莉。
Rosalie.


461
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.391
罗莎莉。
Rosalie.


462
00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:53.392
再见。
Bye.


463
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.561
再见,现在。
Bye-bye, now.


464
00:25:54.627 --> 00:25:56.095
再见。
Bye-bye.


465
00:25:56.796 --> 00:25:57.864
她远道而来。
She came all this way.


466
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.766
你今天不能给她看吗?
You couldn't show her today?


467
00:25:59.832 --> 00:26:02.201
不,不。我有很多事要做。我不是超人。
No, no. I've got a lot to do. I'm not Superman.


468
00:26:02.268 --> 00:26:06.238
嘿,乔伊!
Hey, Joey!


469
00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:07.406
你忘记了这一点。
You forgot this.


470
00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:10.843
谢谢。
Thanks.


471
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.081
我不喜欢那个杜威·布朗。
I don't like that Dewey Brown.


472
00:26:15.147 --> 00:26:17.349
为什么不呢?她是个好女孩。
Why not? She's a nice girl.


473
00:26:17.416 --> 00:26:18.685
她看上你了，乔伊。
She's got eyes for you, Joey.


474
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:19.752
什么?
What?


475
00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:20.920
我看得出来。
I can see that.


476
00:26:20.987 --> 00:26:22.555
来吧。她只是个孩子。
Come on. She's only a kid.


477
00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:25.992
她很漂亮。你觉得她漂亮吗?
She's very pretty. You think she's pretty?


478
00:26:26.058 --> 00:26:27.259
她很漂亮。
She's pretty.


479
00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:28.695
她的身材也很漂亮。
She's got a beautiful body too.


480
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:29.996
那又怎样?我在乎什么?
So what? What do I care?


481
00:26:30.062 --> 00:26:31.998
你是世界上最好的妻子。
You're the best wife in the world.


482
00:26:32.064 --> 00:26:33.866
我还想要什么?
What more could I want?


483
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.905
你工作太辛苦了。
You work too hard.


484
00:26:38.971 --> 00:26:40.707
你应该找个水管工。
You should get a plumber.


485
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:43.576
我付不起，你知道的。
I can't afford that, and you know it.


486
00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:46.178
我从来没让你在家修过东西。
I can never get you to fix anything at home.


487
00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:47.714
你妈妈修理一切。
Your mother fixes everything.


488
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.850
half-woman half-wrench。
half-woman, half-wrench.


489
00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:54.186
所以它在这里。看到了吗?
So this goes right here. See?


490
00:26:54.253 --> 00:26:56.589
保存在一起。
Holds it together.


491
00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:59.559
这是餐厅，不是车库。
This is a restaurant, not a garage.


492
00:26:59.626 --> 00:27:01.393
娜佳奶奶什么都能修。
Grandma Nadja can fix anything.


493
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.696
她昨天修好了妈妈的车。
She fixed Mommy's car yesterday.


494
00:27:03.763 --> 00:27:05.164
交流发电机被枪杀了。
Alternator was shot.


495
00:27:05.231 --> 00:27:09.502
一个女人做这种工作是不正常的。
It's not natural, a woman doing this kind of work.


496
00:27:09.569 --> 00:27:13.540
你知道，做这种工作的人每小时能赚20到30美元。
You know, people get paid $20, $30 an hour for this kind of work.


497
00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:15.842
你可以免费食宿。你还想怎么样?
You get free room and board. What more do you want?


498
00:27:15.908 --> 00:27:17.877
别那样跟妈妈说话!
Don't talk to Mama that way!


499
00:27:17.944 --> 00:27:19.946
她属于老年之家。
She belongs in an old-age home.


500
00:27:23.616 --> 00:27:25.117
她说了什么?
What did she say?


501
00:27:25.184 --> 00:27:26.719
别听他的，好吗?
Don't listen to him, okay?


502
00:27:49.408 --> 00:27:51.377
我待会儿再来。
I'll come back later.


503
00:27:57.283 --> 00:27:58.450
怎么了，多姆?
What's the matter, Dom?


504
00:27:58.517 --> 00:27:59.552
发生了什么事?
What happened?


505
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:00.519
我伤了手指。
I hurt my finger.


506
00:28:00.587 --> 00:28:01.888
让我看看。
Let me see.


507
00:28:01.954 --> 00:28:03.222
我们可以解决这个问题。
We can fix that.


508
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:05.257
这里。没有问题。
Here. No problem.


509
00:28:05.324 --> 00:28:06.292
我们马上修好。
We'll fix it right up.


510
00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:07.594
现在把它放进嘴里。
Now put that in your mouth.


511
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.795
这是怎么回事?
How's that?


512
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:13.399
更好的好。这是我的男孩。
Better Good. That's my boy.


513
00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:19.271
我们可以吃吗?
Can we eat?


514
00:28:32.118 --> 00:28:33.152
我返回。
I'm returning these.


515
00:28:33.219 --> 00:28:35.421
好的。谢谢。
Okay. Thanks.


516
00:28:51.503 --> 00:28:54.273
我在图书馆做什么?
What am I doing in a library?


517
00:28:56.142 --> 00:28:58.344
那是什么香水吗?你闻起来真香。
What's that perfume? You smell so good.


518
00:28:59.078 --> 00:29:00.246
乔伊。
Joey.


519
00:29:00.312 --> 00:29:01.380
什么?
What?


520
00:29:01.447 --> 00:29:03.515
不在这里。他们会把我们赶出去的。
Not here. They're going to throw us out.


521
00:29:03.582 --> 00:29:06.052
好。
Good.


522
00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:07.920
拿上你的书，我们走吧。
Get your book, and let's get out of here.


523
00:29:07.987 --> 00:29:10.589
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going to go?


524
00:29:10.657 --> 00:29:14.026
我们去你家，玩得开心点。
I say we go to your place, have a good time.


525
00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:16.162
你妻子呢?
What about your wife?


526
00:29:16.228 --> 00:29:19.365
不，她不能来。
No, she can't come.


527
00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:22.935
都准备好了吗?来吧。
All set? Come on.


528
00:29:23.002 --> 00:29:25.371
我很快就要回去工作了。
I've got to get back to work soon.


529
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.331
博卡夫人?
Mrs. Boca?


530
00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:54.867
你好,米莉。嗨。
Hi, Millie. Hi.


531
00:29:54.934 --> 00:29:56.268
你没事吧?
You okay?


532
00:29:56.335 --> 00:29:57.269
有人抢劫你了吗?
Did somebody mug you?


533
00:29:57.336 --> 00:30:01.273
我很好,亲爱的。
I'm fine, sweetie.


534
00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:07.513
我…我丢了一些东西，但没关系。
I... I lost something, but it's okay.


535
00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:09.849
你们去吧，伙计们。我会没事的。
You go ahead, guys. I'll be all right.


536
00:30:09.916 --> 00:30:12.118
我们能帮你找找吗?
Could we help you look for it?


537
00:30:12.184 --> 00:30:16.856
我会找到它。
I'll find it.


538
00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:17.757
好的。
Okay.


539
00:30:17.824 --> 00:30:19.425
来吧。
Come on.


540
00:30:45.752 --> 00:30:49.621
傻瓜。愚蠢的傻瓜!
Fool. Stupid fool!


541
00:31:56.422 --> 00:31:58.825
他离婚吗?不,从来没有。我为什么要呢?
Divorce him? No, never. Why should I?


542
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:00.827
好让他搬去和别的女人同居吗?
So he can move in with some other woman?


543
00:32:00.893 --> 00:32:01.928
我宁愿他先死。
I'd rather see him dead first.


544
00:32:01.994 --> 00:32:05.031
很好。他该死。
Good. He deserves to die.


545
00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:09.135
把脏毛巾扔得到处都是。他是一个烂摊子。
Leaves dirty towels everywhere. He's a mess.


546
00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:12.805
我恨他，妈妈。
I hate him, Mama.


547
00:32:12.872 --> 00:32:15.274
这么多年来，我真是个傻瓜。
All these years, what a fool I am.


548
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:17.776
德沃也警告过我。
Devo tried to warn me too.


549
00:32:17.844 --> 00:32:23.883
他死得越早，你就活得越早。
The sooner he's dead, the sooner you begin to live.


550
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.919
我认识一个需要钱的人。
I know someone who needs money.


551
00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:28.520
他会这样做。
He'd do it.


552
00:32:28.587 --> 00:32:31.423
他是个好孩子，人很好。
He's a good boy, very nice.


553
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.392
你是怎么认识这类人的?
How do you know these sort of people?


554
00:32:33.459 --> 00:32:34.894
我有很多朋友。
I've got a lot of friends.


555
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:36.495
你知道的。
You know that.


556
00:32:36.562 --> 00:32:38.197
杀手?
Killers?


557
00:32:38.264 --> 00:32:40.032
不是真正的杀手，不是。
Not real killers, no.


558
00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:42.401
他们这么做只是为了钱。
They only do it for money.


559
00:32:45.972 --> 00:32:47.473
如果我们被抓了怎么办?
What if we get caught?


560
00:32:47.539 --> 00:32:49.275
哦,请罗莎莉。
Oh, Rosalie, please.


561
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:52.044
在美国，人们互相残杀。
In America, people kill each other left and right.


562
00:32:52.111 --> 00:32:53.846
这就像是全国性的消遣。
It's like national pastime.


563
00:32:53.913 --> 00:32:55.982
没有人被抓。
Nobody gets caught.


564
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.151
我不知道。
I don't know.


565
00:32:59.218 --> 00:33:02.989
我只是很久没做过这种事了。
I just haven't done this kind of thing in a long time.


566
00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:05.091
好吧，它很容易回来。
Well, it comes back easy.


567
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:06.525
上次是什么时候?
When was last time?


568
00:33:06.592 --> 00:33:09.195
那是很久以前的事了。我记不清楚了。
It was a long time ago. I don't remember exactly.


569
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:11.797
好吧，你会为我做的。
Well, you'll do it for me.


570
00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:13.299
好的。
Okay.


571
00:33:13.365 --> 00:33:18.437
为了纪念你和我祖母的友谊，我保证我会干掉他。
In honor of your friendship with my grandmother, I guarantee I'll take this guy out.


572
00:33:18.504 --> 00:33:20.739
好的。你真是个好孩子。
Okay. You're very good boy.


573
00:33:20.806 --> 00:33:23.375
现在有这么多年轻人，他们不尊重人。
So many young people today, they have no respect.


574
00:33:23.442 --> 00:33:27.013
我认为这是因为电视，太多的性和暴力。
I think it's because of TV, so much sex and violence.


575
00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:29.615
是啊，谁能想到这个世界会变成什么样子?
Yeah, who can figure what this world's coming to?


576
00:33:56.008 --> 00:33:57.809
错误的房子。
Wrong house.


577
00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:06.818
狗娘养的，混蛋!
Son of a bitch, bastard!


578
00:34:15.627 --> 00:34:16.963
罗莎莉!
Rosalie!


579
00:34:17.029 --> 00:34:20.499
这是难以置信的。就差这么多。
It was unbelievable. It was by this much.


580
00:34:20.566 --> 00:34:22.334
进来吧。坐在这儿吧。
Come on in. Sit down here.


581
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.136
谢谢你这么快就过来。
I appreciate your coming over so quick.


582
00:34:24.203 --> 00:34:26.005
好吧,没关系。
Well, it's okay.


583
00:34:26.072 --> 00:34:27.406
听说过吗?
Ever hear of it?


584
00:34:27.473 --> 00:34:29.041
想用棒球棍打我吗?
Trying to hit me with a baseball bat?


585
00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:31.077
我的天，真是难以置信。
My God, it's unbelievable.


586
00:34:31.143 --> 00:34:32.911
罗莎莉，你在干什么?
Rosalie, what are you doing?


587
00:34:32.979 --> 00:34:34.846
给斯库纳警探倒杯咖啡。
Get Detective Schooner a cup of coffee.


588
00:34:34.913 --> 00:34:36.682
不。我很好,罗莎莉。谢谢你！
No. I'm okay, Rosalie. Thank you.


589
00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:39.085
不，她会在五分钟内给你煮咖啡。
No, she'll make you coffee in five minutes.


590
00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:41.353
谢谢,乔伊。我正在努力戒掉它。
Thanks, Joey. I'm trying to give it up.


591
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.959
不，拜托，你不喝咖啡了?从没听说过。
No, come on, please-- You give up coffee? Never heard of that.


592
00:34:47.026 --> 00:34:48.894
让我神经兮兮的。
Makes me jumpy.


593
00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:52.231
神经兮兮的?
Jumpy?


594
00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:55.067
罗莎莉，给拉里来点培根和鸡蛋怎么样?
Rosalie, how about some bacon and eggs for Larry?


595
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.668
他努力工作。
He works hard.


596
00:34:56.735 --> 00:35:01.407
我什么都不要，谢谢。罗莎莉，请坐。
Nothing for me, thank you. Rosalie, please sit down.


597
00:35:01.473 --> 00:35:04.276
我不是来吃早餐的，乔伊。
I didn't come here for breakfast, Joey.


598
00:35:04.343 --> 00:35:07.513
好的。从一开始。
Okay. From the beginning.


599
00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:11.417
当然，从一开始。好的。
Sure, from the beginning. Okay.


600
00:35:11.483 --> 00:35:16.422
有个戴着亚伯拉罕·林肯面具的疯子想用棒球棍爆我的头。
Some maniac in an Abraham Lincoln mask tries to brain me with a baseball bat.


601
00:35:16.488 --> 00:35:17.923
这就是整个故事。
That's the whole story.


602
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.160
你能看到他长什么样吗?
Yeah, could you see what he looked like?


603
00:35:21.227 --> 00:35:27.433
是的，他看起来就像亚伯拉罕·林肯准备击球。
Yeah, he looked like Abraham Lincoln coming up to bat.


604
00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:30.536
这算哪门子杀人方式?
What kind of way is that to kill somebody?


605
00:35:30.602 --> 00:35:31.937
一根棒球棒?
A baseball bat?


606
00:35:32.004 --> 00:35:34.440
现在我知道你为什么认为谋杀是全民消遣了。
Now I know why you think murder's the national pastime.


607
00:35:34.506 --> 00:35:36.875
棒球棒比枪便宜多了。
Baseball bat is much cheaper than gun.


608
00:35:36.942 --> 00:35:39.145
亚伯拉罕·林肯比乔治·华盛顿还便宜?
Abraham Lincoln is cheaper than George Washington?


609
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.412
我不认识他。
I don't know him.


610
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:57.663
罗莎莉，你在哪?
Rosalie, where are you?


611
00:35:57.729 --> 00:35:59.565
现在我们要做什么?
Now what are we going to do?


612
00:35:59.631 --> 00:36:01.667
这一次，一切都由我负责。
This time, I take care of everything.


613
00:36:01.733 --> 00:36:03.135
我们明天谈。
We'll talk tomorrow.


614
00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:04.970
这是错误的。这是错误的。
This is wrong. It's wrong.


615
00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:07.739
交给我吧。我自己做。
You leave it to me. I do it myself.


616
00:36:07.806 --> 00:36:09.341
不!不做任何事。
No! Don't do anything.


617
00:36:09.408 --> 00:36:10.742
我们明天谈。
We'll talk tomorrow.


618
00:36:15.081 --> 00:36:16.215
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing out here?


619
00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:18.684
什么?
What?


620
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.019
你在做什么?
What are you doing?


621
00:36:21.087 --> 00:36:21.920
只是透透气。
Just getting some air.


622
00:36:21.987 --> 00:36:23.422
来吧。
Come on.


623
00:36:23.489 --> 00:36:25.291
有个疯子在附近游荡。
There's a maniac loose in the neighborhood.


624
00:36:25.357 --> 00:36:26.692
进屋去。
Get in the house.


625
00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:28.360
什么
What


626
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.038
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!


627
00:36:40.106 --> 00:36:42.474
好吧，亚伯拉罕·林肯先生，狗娘养的，混蛋!
All right, Mr. Abraham Lincoln, son of a bitch, bastard!


628
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.710
现在你打算怎么做?
Now what are you going to do, huh?


629
00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:46.745
是的——你在干什么?
Yeah-- What are you doing?


630
00:36:46.812 --> 00:36:49.181
没什么。我有枪。
Nothing. I've got my gun.


631
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:50.782
你要枪干什么?
What do you want a gun for?


632
00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:53.385
我想那个戴面具的人是想抢劫我。
I figure that guy in the mask is trying to rob me.


633
00:36:53.452 --> 00:36:54.686
生意很好。
Business is good.


634
00:36:54.753 --> 00:36:57.289
人们以为我随身带着很多现金。
People think I carry a lot of cash around.


635
00:36:57.356 --> 00:37:00.992
我不喜欢家里有枪和孩子们在一起。
I don't like having a gun in the house with the children.


636
00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:51.310
*不要忘记你是我的爱人*
* Don't forget You are my darling *


637
00:37:51.377 --> 00:37:54.746
别忘了…＊
* Don't forget to be... *


638
00:38:12.898 --> 00:38:14.466
罗莎莉，来吧，如果你要来的话。
Rosalie, come on, if you're coming.


639
00:38:16.302 --> 00:38:17.303
乔伊,等等。
Joey, wait up.


640
00:38:17.369 --> 00:38:18.804
我不是田径明星。
I'm not a track star.


641
00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:21.207
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?


642
00:38:21.273 --> 00:38:22.841
看看他对这片灌木做了什么。
Look what he did to this bush.


643
00:38:22.908 --> 00:38:24.042
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.


644
00:38:30.682 --> 00:38:32.050
不!不,停止!
No! No, stop!


645
00:38:32.117 --> 00:38:35.321
等等!等待。不,等等。
Wait! Wait. No, wait.


646
00:38:35.387 --> 00:38:36.555
怎么了?
What's wrong?


647
00:38:36.622 --> 00:38:38.190
你在做什么?
What are you doing?


648
00:38:38.257 --> 00:38:39.791
去工作。
Going to work.


649
00:38:39.858 --> 00:38:40.992
不,等等。
No, wait.


650
00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:42.461
你怎么了?
What's the matter with you?


651
00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:44.263
你们从来不一起上班。
You never go to work together.


652
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.164
所以今天，我们一起走。
So today, we go together.


653
00:38:46.232 --> 00:38:50.436
我不喜欢今天早上我的车发出的声音，你能看看吗?
I didn't like the way my car sounded this morning, so would you look at it?


654
00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:56.742
在星期三下雨的时候，男人和女人一起坐车是很不吉利的。
It's very bad luck for man and woman to go together in car on Wednesday, when it's raining.


655
00:38:56.808 --> 00:38:58.377
下雨了。那又怎样?
It's raining. So what?


656
00:38:58.444 --> 00:39:00.011
它是湿的。
It's wet.


657
00:39:00.078 --> 00:39:02.481
雨总是湿的。
Rain is always wet.


658
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:03.515
街道是湿的。
The streets are wet.


659
00:39:03.582 --> 00:39:04.616
娜佳妈妈，你在干什么?
Mama Nadja, what are you doing?


660
00:39:04.683 --> 00:39:05.884
你怎么了?
What's the matter with you?


661
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:06.985
你到底是怎么了?
What the hell's wrong with you?


662
00:39:07.052 --> 00:39:08.320
今天是星期三。
It's Wednesday.


663
00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.122
你介意吗?我们得去工作了。
Do you mind? We've got to go to work.


664
00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:16.161
星期三的交通很糟糕，尤其是街上潮湿的时候。
Traffic is bad on Wednesdays, especially when streets are wet.


665
00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:17.663
你想让我因为堵车而待在家里?
You want me to stay home because of traffic?


666
00:39:17.729 --> 00:39:23.001
我想让罗莎莉待在家里帮我打扫房间。
I want Rosalie to stay home and help me with the housecleaning.


667
00:39:23.068 --> 00:39:26.238
清扫房间吗?
Housecleaning?


668
00:39:26.305 --> 00:39:27.306
我有工作要做。
I've got work to do.


669
00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:29.040
不!
No!


670
00:39:36.047 --> 00:39:37.082
你们俩怎么了?
What's the matter with you two?


671
00:39:45.123 --> 00:39:47.926
你为什么不告诉我你要炸了那辆车?
Why didn't you tell me you were going to blow up the car?


672
00:39:47.993 --> 00:39:49.961
我想这对你来说会是个惊喜。
I thought it would be a nice surprise for you.


673
00:39:50.028 --> 00:39:53.432
妈妈，我们说的不是生日派对。
Mama, we're not talking about a birthday party.


674
00:39:53.499 --> 00:39:55.834
我们要杀的是他，不是我。
We're supposed to be killing him, not me.


675
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:59.004
我不知道哪里出了问题。
I don't know what goes wrong.


676
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:03.775
我把电线从分电器盖连接到油箱里的火花塞。
I run a wire from distributor cap to spark plug in gas tank.


677
00:40:03.842 --> 00:40:05.944
我想当他发动汽车时，砰!
I figure when he starts car, boom!


678
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:07.112
整个东西都在上升。
Whole thing goes up.


679
00:40:07.178 --> 00:40:08.980
再见,乔伊。
Bye-bye, Joey.


680
00:40:09.047 --> 00:40:10.982
乔伊不应该那样死。
Joey shouldn't die that way.


681
00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:12.851
那是一种可怕的死法。
That's a terrible way to die.


682
00:40:12.918 --> 00:40:14.085
他应该怎么死呢?
Well, how should he die?


683
00:40:14.152 --> 00:40:20.058
我不知道，但更…更好的吗?
I don't know, but something a little more... Nicer?


684
00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:23.629
我会考虑的。
I'll think about it.


685
00:40:23.695 --> 00:40:25.063
他仍然是我的丈夫。
He's still my husband.


686
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.033
你自己也说过你恨他。
You said yourself you hate him.


687
00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:31.703
当我想到他跟那么多女人在一起时——哦，天哪，妈妈!
When I think of all the women he's been with-- Oh, God, Mama!


688
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.840
他欺骗你，愚弄你。
He cheats on you and makes a fool of you.


689
00:40:34.906 --> 00:40:36.207
我知道。我知道。
I know. I know.


690
00:40:36.274 --> 00:40:40.078
罗莎莉，求你了，如果你不杀他，就杀了你自己。
Rosalie, please, if you don't kill him, kill yourself.


691
00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:42.047
我相信可以安排。
I'm sure that can be arranged.


692
00:40:42.113 --> 00:40:49.321
我看到代码特别声明——站在队列中!
I see the code specifically states-- Stand fast in the ranks!


693
00:40:49.388 --> 00:40:51.222
你跟我说的是密码?
You speak to me of code?


694
00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:53.925
什么代码?
What code?


695
00:40:53.992 --> 00:40:57.596
懦夫的代码。
A coward's code.


696
00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:01.032
你对士兵守则了解多少?
What do you know of the Soldier's Code?


697
00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:03.234
很多胡椒。
A lot of pepper.


698
00:41:07.939 --> 00:41:10.108
一些不错的牛至。
Some nice oregano.


699
00:41:10.175 --> 00:41:12.243
再加一点罗勒。
And a little basil.


700
00:41:17.282 --> 00:41:19.317
很多安眠药。
A lot of sleeping pills.


701
00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:24.055
你确定他不会进来吗?
You sure he won't come in here?


702
00:41:24.122 --> 00:41:25.757
乔伊?不是一个机会。
Joey? Not a chance.


703
00:41:25.824 --> 00:41:29.728
他希望得到周到的服务。
He expects to be waited on hand and foot.


704
00:41:29.795 --> 00:41:31.597
妈妈，别尝。
Mama, don't taste it.


705
00:41:31.663 --> 00:41:33.264
需要更多的辣椒。
Needs more pepper.


706
00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:36.735
让它辣。
Make it spicy.


707
00:41:36.802 --> 00:41:38.504
一点盐。
A little salt.


708
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.772
还有一点酒。
And a splash of wine.


709
00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:46.645
还有很多安眠药。
And a lot of sleeping pills.


710
00:41:49.314 --> 00:41:50.882
到目前为止你投了多少钱?
How much did you put in so far?


711
00:41:50.949 --> 00:41:52.250
整整两瓶。
Two whole bottles.


712
00:41:52.317 --> 00:41:53.519
什么?
What?


713
00:41:53.585 --> 00:41:54.920
应该足以杀人了。
Should be enough to kill anyone.


714
00:41:54.986 --> 00:41:56.154
即使是乔伊。
Even Joey.


715
00:41:58.056 --> 00:42:00.058
他要做这件事。
He's going to do it.


716
00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:02.628
相信我，他真的会这么做的。
Believe me, he's really going to do it.


717
00:42:02.694 --> 00:42:04.295
给你。
Here you go.


718
00:42:06.832 --> 00:42:09.234
我警告你，斋藤上校。
I warn you, Colonel Saito.


719
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.836
孩子们在哪里?
Where are the kids?


720
00:42:10.902 --> 00:42:12.871
他们在露西阿姨家过周末。
They're at Aunt Lucy's for the weekend.


721
00:42:16.942 --> 00:42:20.078
一定要让他吃。
Make sure he eats it.


722
00:42:24.115 --> 00:42:25.484
你在看什么?
What are you looking at?


723
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:27.553
你的意大利面怎么样?
How's your spaghetti?


724
00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:30.288
好的。
Okay.


725
00:42:30.355 --> 00:42:32.858
有很多更多。
There's plenty more.


726
00:42:40.699 --> 00:42:44.002
这是最好吃的意大利面，罗莎莉。
It's the best spaghetti ever, Rosalie.


727
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:49.340
看，又香又辣，跟我妈做的一样。
See, nice and spicy, just like my mother's.


728
00:42:52.243 --> 00:42:54.345
没关系。
That's okay.


729
00:43:00.486 --> 00:43:02.087
真可惜孩子们都在露西阿姨家。
Too bad the kids are at Aunt Lucy's.


730
00:43:02.153 --> 00:43:04.723
他们错过了一顿大餐。
They're missing a great meal.


731
00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:18.904
一个帮助。
One more helping.


732
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.873
再给我拿一瓶啤酒来。
And bring me another beer.


733
00:43:24.142 --> 00:43:26.878
怎么了?你不是饿了吗?
What's the matter? You're not hungry?


734
00:43:47.098 --> 00:43:48.266
我感觉不太好。
I don't feel so good.


735
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:52.838
没有?
No?


736
00:43:52.904 --> 00:43:54.573
有点胃痛。
A little stomachache.


737
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.274
这是所有吗?
Is that all?


738
00:43:56.341 --> 00:43:58.009
"就这些了"是什么意思
What do you mean, "Is that all?"


739
00:43:58.076 --> 00:43:59.945
你想让我吃什么?
What do you want me to have?


740
00:44:00.011 --> 00:44:01.780
也许你应该吃点东西。
Maybe you should take something.


741
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:03.348
像什么?
Like what?


742
00:44:03.414 --> 00:44:06.484
再来点意大利面怎么样?
How about some more spaghetti?


743
00:44:06.552 --> 00:44:07.919
意大利面条?
Spaghetti?


744
00:44:07.986 --> 00:44:09.655
解决了肚子。
Settles the stomach.


745
00:44:09.721 --> 00:44:12.090
我去拿点来。
I'll go get some.


746
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.695
我不知道。
I don't know.


747
00:44:16.762 --> 00:44:18.296
也许我给他的不够多。
Maybe I didn't give him enough.


748
00:44:18.363 --> 00:44:20.766
但他吃了整整三碗。
But he had three whole bowls.


749
00:44:20.832 --> 00:44:22.000
一头牛。
What an ox.


750
00:44:22.067 --> 00:44:24.069
乔伊不是正常人。
Well, Joey is not a normal man.


751
00:44:24.135 --> 00:44:25.436
你知道他这个人。
You know how he is.


752
00:44:25.503 --> 00:44:33.979
每天工作14到15个小时，一周工作7天，每晚睡眠从不超过2到3个小时。
Works 14, 15 hours a day, seven days a week, never sleeps more than two or three hours a night.


753
00:44:34.045 --> 00:44:37.015
每晚都和不同的女人约会。
Out with a different woman every night.


754
00:44:37.082 --> 00:44:43.321
罗莎莉……他想吃什么就吃什么，从来没长胖过。
Rosalie... He eats anything he wants, never gains any weight.


755
00:44:43.388 --> 00:44:45.190
他不是人类。
He's not human.


756
00:44:45.256 --> 00:44:47.959
就像某种动物。
It's like some kind of animal.


757
00:44:48.026 --> 00:44:49.394
我们面对的是一台机器。
We're dealing with a machine.


758
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.729
罗莎莉!什么?
Rosalie! What?


759
00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:54.666
我现在感觉好多了。
I feel better now.


760
00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:59.304
我玩得很开心。这就是我所需要的。
I had a good crap. That's all I needed.


761
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:04.142
多么美丽的夜晚啊!
What a beautiful night!


762
00:45:10.782 --> 00:45:13.218
看到了吗?
See?


763
00:45:14.953 --> 00:45:21.760
意思是不要忘记你是我的宝贝
* Means don't forget You are my darlings *


764
00:45:21.827 --> 00:45:26.064
来吧。你不唱歌。
Come on. You're not singing.


765
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:32.170
*不要忘记你对我来说意味着一切……＊
* Don't forget to be All you mean to me... *


766
00:45:39.444 --> 00:45:49.444
*我的爱就像一颗星星*我的爱人*闪耀着明亮而清晰的光芒只因为你在这里*
* My love is like a star * My darling * Shining bright and clear Just because you're here *


767
00:45:54.993 --> 00:46:04.870
请不要忘记……你为什么要走?＊
* Please do not forget... * Why the hell Are you leaving? *


768
00:46:16.915 --> 00:46:19.617
来吧,女士们。我们走吧。
Come on, ladies. Let's go.


769
00:46:19.685 --> 00:46:22.721
垄断。
Monopoly.


770
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:30.762
噢，野兔今晚可爽了。
Whoa, the Wild Hare is feeling his oats tonight.


771
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.097
结束电话。
A close call.


772
00:46:32.163 --> 00:46:35.066
这就是它的样子，但我们要等测量结果出来。
That's what it looks like, but we'll wait for the measurement.


773
00:46:35.133 --> 00:46:36.134
没有更多的。
No more.


774
00:46:36.201 --> 00:46:39.170
你完成它。
You finish it.


775
00:46:39.237 --> 00:46:42.007
起跑线起飞使他占了上风。
A starting-line launch gave him the advantage.


776
00:46:42.073 --> 00:46:47.679
完全悬浮在赛车上方，但在冠军赤脚后面几英寸。
Completely airborne over the cars, but inches behind Barefoot, the winner.


777
00:46:50.381 --> 00:46:54.252
乔伊
Joey


778
00:47:04.662 --> 00:47:05.630
你在做什么?
What are you doing?


779
00:47:05.697 --> 00:47:06.597
我们朝他开枪。
We shoot him.


780
00:47:06.664 --> 00:47:07.966
不!不。
No! No.


781
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:09.835
但我们必须这么做。我们现在不能回去了。
But we have to. We can't go back now.


782
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:11.069
不，我们做得太过分了。
No, we've gone too far.


783
00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:17.475
如果我们带他去医院，他们会发现他总是做白日梦。
If we take him to the hospital, they find him full of dreamies.


784
00:47:17.542 --> 00:47:19.845
他们会知道我们想杀他。
They'll know we tried to kill him.


785
00:47:19.911 --> 00:47:21.646
我们别无选择。
We have no choice.


786
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:23.548
我们不能这么做。
We can't do that.


787
00:47:23.614 --> 00:47:24.983
我们不能杀他，妈妈。
We can't shoot him, Mama.


788
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:25.951
我们可以不?不!
We can't? No!


789
00:47:32.824 --> 00:47:35.894
好的，我们找到德沃了。
Okay, we get Devo.


790
00:47:35.961 --> 00:47:37.095
他的哥哥是海军陆战队的。
His brother was in Marines.


791
00:47:37.162 --> 00:47:39.464
他知道枪。
He knows guns.


792
00:47:47.372 --> 00:47:49.640
你好。
Hello.


793
00:47:49.707 --> 00:47:51.176
Devo,娜迪亚。
Devo, it's Nadja.


794
00:47:51.242 --> 00:47:52.143
嘿,娜迪亚。
Hey, Nadja.


795
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.378
你独自吗?
Are you alone?


796
00:47:53.444 --> 00:47:54.379
是的,为什么?
Yeah, why?


797
00:47:54.445 --> 00:47:55.446
好。
Good.


798
00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:57.115
戴沃，你知道你对罗莎莉的感觉吗?
Devo, you know how you feel about Rosalie?


799
00:47:57.182 --> 00:48:00.986
你怎么说你有多喜欢她?
How you say how much you like her?


800
00:48:01.052 --> 00:48:02.854
我爱罗莎莉。
I love Rosalie.


801
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:05.123
你愿意为她做什么?
And how you would do anything for her?


802
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:06.357
是的,任何东西。绝对的。
Yes, anything. Absolutely.


803
00:48:06.424 --> 00:48:10.595
什么吗?是的,任何东西。为什么?
Anything? Yeah, anything. Why?


804
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:13.131
你是个好孩子，很贴心。
You are a good boy, very sweet.


805
00:48:13.198 --> 00:48:17.836
我想让你帮我和罗莎莉一个小忙。
I want you to do a little favor for Rosalie and me.


806
00:48:17.903 --> 00:48:19.771
你来我家，我告诉你这是什么。
You come to the house, I'll tell you what it is.


807
00:48:19.838 --> 00:48:21.672
好的。
Okay.


808
00:48:32.683 --> 00:48:34.853
稍等。等一下。
Wait a moment. Wait a minute.


809
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.088
床单很珍贵。
The bedspread is very precious.


810
00:48:37.155 --> 00:48:39.124
别毁了它。
Don't ruin it.


811
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.359
好的。在他的背上。
Okay. On his back.


812
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.921
你知道该怎么做。
You know what to do.


813
00:49:09.988 --> 00:49:11.689
等待。你要去哪里?
Wait. Where are you going?


814
00:49:11.756 --> 00:49:12.790
我不能看。
I can't watch.


815
00:49:12.858 --> 00:49:13.925
我一个人做不到。
I can't do this alone.


816
00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:15.260
他是我的丈夫。
He's my husband.


817
00:49:15.326 --> 00:49:17.095
你到底想不想让他死?
Do you want him dead or not?


818
00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:19.430
我要他死，但我不希望他受伤。
I want him dead, but I don't want him hurt.


819
00:49:19.497 --> 00:49:20.798
他不会受伤的。他不会。
He won't get hurt. He won't.


820
00:49:20.866 --> 00:49:22.934
他的声音睡着了。
He's sound asleep.


821
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:24.903
是的。
Yeah.


822
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.737
我们要让他永远沉睡下去。
We're keeping him asleep forever.


823
00:49:26.804 --> 00:49:27.805
我不能看。
I can't watch.


824
00:49:27.873 --> 00:49:28.907
罗莎莉!
Rosalie!


825
00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:43.354
多久没见了?
How long has it been?


826
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:48.093
很快，乔伊醒了。然后呢?
Pretty soon, Joey wakes up. Then what?


827
00:49:52.297 --> 00:49:54.232
我做不到。我要阻止他。
I can't do it. I'm going to stop him.


828
00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:01.940
你没事吧?
Are you all right?


829
00:50:02.007 --> 00:50:02.941
我没事吧?
Am I all right?


830
00:50:03.008 --> 00:50:05.877
我是不是你为什么要问我是否还好?
Am I all-- Why are you asking me if I'm all right?


831
00:50:05.944 --> 00:50:07.745
他才是那个中枪的人。
He's the one who got shot.


832
00:50:07.812 --> 00:50:08.980
你最好坐下。
You'd better sit down.


833
00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:10.916
不!我不想坐下。
No! I don't want to sit down.


834
00:50:10.982 --> 00:50:12.951
乔伊呢?
What about Joey?


835
00:50:13.018 --> 00:50:14.252
他是活着还是死了?
Is he alive or dead?


836
00:50:14.319 --> 00:50:17.688
我不知道。
I don't know.


837
00:50:17.755 --> 00:50:19.724
血。
Blood.


838
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.392
不,番茄酱。
No, tomato sauce.


839
00:50:21.459 --> 00:50:22.660
番茄酱吗?
Tomato sauce?


840
00:50:22.727 --> 00:50:24.562
你到底有没有朝他开枪?
Did you shoot him or not?


841
00:50:24.629 --> 00:50:26.464
我想是的。
I think so.


842
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:28.466
你是什么意思?我听到一声枪响。
What do you mean? I heard a shot.


843
00:50:28.533 --> 00:50:32.037
我朝他开了一枪，但我不知道有没有打中他。
I shot him, but I don't know if I hit him.


844
00:50:32.103 --> 00:50:33.704
我是说，我在最后一秒把头扭开了。
I mean, I turned my head away at the last second.


845
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:36.007
抱歉，但我实在看不下去了。
I'm sorry, but I couldn't bear to watch.


846
00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:37.575
我以为你懂枪。
I thought you knew about guns.


847
00:50:37.642 --> 00:50:40.245
我以前从没开过枪。
I never shot anyone before.


848
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:42.313
哦,别担心。我明白了。
Oh, don't worry. I understand.


849
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.049
凡事都有第一次。
There's a first time for everything.


850
00:50:44.115 --> 00:50:48.253
我读到过一个牙科保健师妈妈，没关系。
I read about a dental hygienist-- Mama, never mind.


851
00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:52.623
哦,等等。有一些血。
Oh, wait. There's some blood.


852
00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:55.893
让我看看。
Let me see.


853
00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:57.528
它是什么?
What is it?


854
00:50:57.595 --> 00:51:00.298
我觉得是个弹孔。这是非常小的。
I think it's a bullet hole. It's very small.


855
00:51:00.365 --> 00:51:03.969
一颗子弹洞吗?你确定吗?
A bullet hole? Are you sure?


856
00:51:04.035 --> 00:51:05.236
是的,我肯定。
Yes, I'm sure.


857
00:51:05.303 --> 00:51:06.671
他死了吗?
Is he dead?


858
00:51:06.737 --> 00:51:09.207
乔伊乔伊?
Joey Joey?


859
00:51:09.274 --> 00:51:11.409
罗莎莉。什么?
Rosalie. What?


860
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:17.348
我觉得不太热。有点头疼。
I don't feel so hot. Got a little headache.


861
00:51:17.415 --> 00:51:20.751
我的胃也不觉得那么热了。
My stomach don't feel so hot neither.


862
00:51:20.818 --> 00:51:22.820
你被病毒感染了，亲爱的
You got a virus, honey.


863
00:51:22.887 --> 00:51:24.990
就是这样一种病毒
That's all, a virus.


864
00:51:25.056 --> 00:51:31.029
病毒洛维医生来过
Virus Dr. Lowe was here.


865
00:51:31.096 --> 00:51:32.497
他是吗?
He was?


866
00:51:32.563 --> 00:51:33.965
是的。
Yeah.


867
00:51:34.032 --> 00:51:35.400
我不记得了。
I don't remember.


868
00:51:35.466 --> 00:51:39.004
对，他来过，给了你机会。
Yeah, he was here, and he gave you a shot.


869
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.371
哦……
Ohh...


870
00:51:43.308 --> 00:51:46.577
能给我一杯水吗?
Can I get a glass of water?


871
00:51:46.644 --> 00:51:47.912
罗莎莉吗?
Rosalie?


872
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:50.948
也许我也吃两片阿司匹林。
Maybe I take a couple of aspirin too.


873
00:51:51.016 --> 00:51:52.050
哦,好的。
Oh, okay.


874
00:51:58.789 --> 00:52:00.225
哇。
Whoa.


875
00:52:03.294 --> 00:52:04.762
我们该怎么办?
What are we going to do?


876
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:08.066
你得再朝他开一枪。
You're going to have to shoot him again.


877
00:52:08.133 --> 00:52:09.567
不。我不能。
No. I can't.


878
00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:11.902
我不敢相信我第一次就做到了。
I can't believe I did it the first time.


879
00:52:11.969 --> 00:52:17.208
真不敢相信你让我这么做。
I can't believe you let me do that.


880
00:52:17.275 --> 00:52:19.544
如果你做不到，你就得找一个能做到的人。
If you can't do it, you have to find someone who can.


881
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.346
我来出钱。
I'll put up the money.


882
00:52:21.412 --> 00:52:22.347
我们需要专业人士。
We need professionals.


883
00:52:22.413 --> 00:52:23.948
这件事必须马上做。
This has to be done right away.


884
00:52:24.015 --> 00:52:25.216
哦，你认识什么人?
Oh, you know someone?


885
00:52:25.283 --> 00:52:28.919
我需要振作起来。
I need to collect myself.


886
00:52:34.992 --> 00:52:38.396
好了，控制住。
All right, get a grip.


887
00:52:38.463 --> 00:52:41.399
振作起来。好吧?好的。我们走吧。
Get your shit together. Okay? Okay. Let's go.


888
00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:46.604
我们能付多少钱?
How much can we pay?


889
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:51.008
尽我们所能。
As much as we have to.


890
00:52:51.076 --> 00:52:52.210
是啊，不过也不是太多。
Yeah, not too much, though.


891
00:52:52.277 --> 00:52:54.245
你知道，尽量打折。
You know, try for discount.


892
00:53:17.135 --> 00:53:18.736
这里有哈兰·詹姆斯吗?
Is there a Harlan James here?


893
00:53:18.803 --> 00:53:21.406
后面的，德沃。
In the back, Devo.


894
00:53:32.883 --> 00:53:35.253
哈兰，最近怎么样?
Hello, Harlan, how's it going?


895
00:53:46.731 --> 00:53:49.167
Devo。
Devo.


896
00:53:49.234 --> 00:53:51.469
你说呢?
What do you say?


897
00:53:58.643 --> 00:54:00.445
你认识我表哥马龙吗?
You know my cousin Marlon?


898
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:04.014
我当然知道。你好吗，马龙?
Well, of course I do. How are you, Marlon?


899
00:54:07.152 --> 00:54:09.420
什么?
What?


900
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.901
300美元不算多。
$300 is not much.


901
00:54:23.968 --> 00:54:27.472
他已经死亡。
He's already dying.


902
00:54:27.538 --> 00:54:29.474
你要做的就是干掉他。
All you have to do is finish him off.


903
00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.076
它仍然是——
It's still--


904
00:54:36.514 --> 00:54:39.984
它仍然是谋杀!
It's still murder!


905
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:44.222
但我已经完成了大部分工作。
But I've already done most of the work.


906
00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.229
我告诉你，600块就能搞定。
I'll tell you, we'll do it for $600.


907
00:54:51.296 --> 00:54:53.564
400美元。
$400.


908
00:54:53.631 --> 00:54:55.766
他都快快入土了。
He's practically got one foot in the grave.


909
00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:58.236
550美元。你说呢?
$550. What do you say?


910
00:55:00.538 --> 00:55:07.545
如果我们要浪费这家伙，我们应该得到报酬，伙计。
If we're going to waste the dude, we ought to get paid for it, man.


911
00:55:07.612 --> 00:55:11.949
这是美国人的方式，对吗?
That's the American way, right?


912
00:55:12.016 --> 00:55:13.584
是的。
Yeah.


913
00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:17.188
是啊，我是说，我们不是…这里有共产主义者，你知道吗?
Yeah, I mean, we're not... communists here, you know?


914
00:55:17.255 --> 00:55:19.490
我们是美国人。我们有谋生的权利。
We're Americans. We got a right to make a living.


915
00:55:19.557 --> 00:55:24.195
500美元。这是我的最终报价。
$500. That's my final offer.


916
00:55:34.939 --> 00:55:36.507
你告诉他。
You tell him.


917
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.414
好的。
Okay.


918
00:55:43.481 --> 00:55:46.917
你感觉怎么样，乔伊?
How you feeling, Joey?


919
00:55:46.984 --> 00:55:49.287
有点累了。
A little tired.


920
00:55:49.354 --> 00:55:50.788
你真的病了，宝贝。
You're real sick, baby.


921
00:55:50.855 --> 00:55:52.257
是的。
Yeah.


922
00:55:52.323 --> 00:55:55.293
也许我睡着了，嘿?
Maybe I sleep, hey?


923
00:55:59.497 --> 00:56:01.566
我在哪里?
What Where am I?


924
00:56:01.632 --> 00:56:04.201
你被病毒感染了，亲爱的没关系。
You got a virus, honey. It's okay.


925
00:56:04.269 --> 00:56:06.271
一个病毒。
A virus.


926
00:56:06.337 --> 00:56:09.707
哦,是的。我忘记了。
Oh, yes. I forgot.


927
00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:24.389
你能看到什么吗?
Can you see anything?


928
00:56:24.455 --> 00:56:27.392
不。
No.


929
00:56:27.458 --> 00:56:30.027
等一下。这是什么东西。
Wait a minute. Here is something.


930
00:56:34.865 --> 00:56:38.135
这是一辆出租车。不可能是为了我们。
It's a cab. It can't be for us.


931
00:56:38.202 --> 00:56:39.537
你想吃一口吗?
Do you want a bite?


932
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:41.005
不。
No.


933
00:56:45.075 --> 00:56:47.412
这些人是谁?
Who are these guys?


934
00:56:47.478 --> 00:56:49.013
8.50美元,请。
$8.50, please.


935
00:56:49.079 --> 00:56:50.247
这是怎么呢
What's going on?


936
00:56:50.315 --> 00:56:53.351
计。给我8.50美元。
The meter. Give me $8.50.


937
00:57:14.939 --> 00:57:16.841
他们在做什么?
What are they doing?


938
00:57:16.907 --> 00:57:19.377
我不知道。
I don't know.


939
00:57:27.885 --> 00:57:29.587
他们要去别的地方。
They're going someplace else.


940
00:57:29.654 --> 00:57:33.057
伙计们!在这里。
Guys! Over here.


941
00:57:33.123 --> 00:57:35.960
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?


942
00:57:36.026 --> 00:57:38.596
它是在这里。
It's over here.


943
00:57:41.866 --> 00:57:43.734
罗莎莉!
Rosalie!


944
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:46.671
是我。
It's me.


945
00:58:06.891 --> 00:58:08.626
你打的。
You took a taxi.


946
00:58:08.693 --> 00:58:11.161
你怎么能那样做?
How could you do that?


947
00:58:11.228 --> 00:58:12.363
这有什么问题吗?
What's wrong with that?


948
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:13.698
你是来杀乔伊的。
You came here to kill Joey.


949
00:58:13.764 --> 00:58:14.999
那又怎样?
So what?


950
00:58:15.065 --> 00:58:19.804
所以乘出租车去犯罪现场通常不被认为是一个好主意。
So it's generally not considered a very good idea to take a taxi to the scene of a crime.


951
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:24.008
嘿,伙计,看。很酷,对吧?
Hey, man, look. Be cool, okay?


952
00:58:24.074 --> 00:58:28.913
我是说，你知道，那家伙只是个出租车司机。
I mean, you know, the dude's only a taxi driver.


953
00:58:30.515 --> 00:58:33.451
他不像他叫什么名字。
He's not like what's his name.


954
00:58:36.421 --> 00:58:37.455
他叫什么名字?
What's his name?


955
00:58:37.522 --> 00:58:38.889
谁?
Who?


956
00:58:42.326 --> 00:58:45.029
你知道的。
You know.


957
00:58:45.095 --> 00:58:46.531
是的,对的。
Yeah, right.


958
00:58:46.597 --> 00:58:48.999
看,没关系。
Look, never mind.


959
00:58:49.066 --> 00:58:50.468
算了吧。这是完成了。好吗?
Forget it. It's done. Okay?


960
00:58:50.535 --> 00:58:55.740
这是罗莎莉，乔伊的妻子，这是罗莎莉的母亲。
This is Rosalie, Joey's wife, and this is Rosalie's mother.


961
00:58:55.806 --> 00:58:56.707
哈伦,马龙。
Harlan, Marlon.


962
00:58:56.774 --> 00:58:58.643
小心
Be careful.


963
00:58:58.709 --> 00:59:00.478
很高兴认识你。
Nice to meet you.


964
00:59:03.714 --> 00:59:05.483
最近怎么样?
How's it going?


965
00:59:09.253 --> 00:59:15.860
你想喝点咖啡或茶或吃点什么吗?在你开始之前?
Would you like some coffee or tea or something to eat before you... Well, before you get started?


966
00:59:19.997 --> 00:59:23.701
不。谢谢。
No. Thanks.


967
00:59:23.768 --> 00:59:24.602
我们很酷。
We're cool.


968
00:59:24.669 --> 00:59:29.273
打扰一下，哈兰，马龙。
Excuse me, Harlan, Marlon.


969
00:59:29.339 --> 00:59:33.077
就一会儿，我想跟戴沃说几句话。
Just for one second, I'd like to have a word with Devo over here.


970
00:59:47.592 --> 00:59:49.059
他们看起来像瘾君子。
They look like drug addicts.


971
00:59:49.126 --> 00:59:50.260
他们都是瘾君子。
Well, they are drug addicts.


972
00:59:50.327 --> 00:59:53.998
哦,我的上帝!你雇了瘾君子?
Oh, my God! You hired drug addicts?


973
00:59:54.064 --> 00:59:56.901
你想让我雇谁，红十字会吗?
Who did you expect me to hire, the Red Cross?


974
00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:58.335
他们看起来很有礼貌。
They seem like very polite boys.


975
00:59:58.402 --> 01:00:00.771
我不喜欢吸毒者来我家。
I don't like drug addicts in my house.


976
01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.373
罗莎莉，拜托，别把他们当成瘾君子。
Rosalie, please, don't think of them as drug addicts.


977
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.375
把他们想象成杀手。
Think of them as killers.


978
01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:17.655
袋鼠是怎么生下人类宝宝的?
How can a kangaroo give birth to a human baby?


979
01:00:17.722 --> 01:00:19.323
这是一个奇迹。这里写着呢。
It's a miracle. It says so right here.


980
01:00:19.389 --> 01:00:22.126
是合法的吗?
Is that legal?


981
01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:26.497
你知道的…和袋鼠做爱?
You know... having sex with a kangaroo?


982
01:00:26.564 --> 01:00:28.733
在这儿。
Here it is.


983
01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:36.907
哦,对不起。
Oh, sorry.


984
01:00:49.954 --> 01:00:51.288
口径的。
.22 caliber.


985
01:00:51.355 --> 01:00:52.289
不是什么好枪。
Not much of a gun.


986
01:00:52.356 --> 01:00:53.490
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?


987
01:00:53.558 --> 01:00:56.126
是有点小，你知道吗?
Well, it's kind of small, you know?


988
01:00:56.193 --> 01:00:57.361
不太流行。
Not much pop.


989
01:00:57.427 --> 01:00:59.129
好吧，这就是我们所知道的。
Well, that's all we've got.


990
01:00:59.196 --> 01:01:02.032
是的，这是我们的枪。
Yeah, this is our gun.


991
01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:05.335
放点音乐，好吗?
Put on some music, okay?


992
01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:08.573
声音要大，这样就能盖过枪声了。
Make it real loud so's it drowns out the noise of the gunshot.


993
01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:10.074
是的,哦。
Yeah, ooh.


994
01:01:13.477 --> 01:01:16.480
在后面，右边。
In the back, on the right.


995
01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:20.818
在角落里。看到灯了吗?门。
In the corner. See the lamp? Door.


996
01:01:27.391 --> 01:01:28.826
那是干什么用的?
What is that for?


997
01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:30.260
我不知道。
I don't know.


998
01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:32.563
以防万一，万一他醒了。
Just in case, you know, like if he wakes up.


999
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.799
哦,好的。
Oh, okay.


1000
01:01:47.511 --> 01:01:50.247
你准备好了吗?
You ready?


1001
01:01:50.314 --> 01:01:54.484
是的,我想。
Yeah, I guess.


1002
01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:58.155
你呢，乔伊?你准备好了吗?
How about you, Joey? You ready?


1003
01:02:00.224 --> 01:02:01.358
让我们做它。
Let's do it.


1004
01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:02.292
哈伦吗?
Harlan?


1005
01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:05.362
什么?
What?


1006
01:02:05.429 --> 01:02:09.800
我以前从没杀过人。
I never killed nobody before.


1007
01:02:09.867 --> 01:02:12.436
他已经半死不活的境地。
He's already half-dead.


1008
01:02:12.502 --> 01:02:19.977
即便如此，我的意思是…你知道，我也没杀过人。
Even so, I mean... you know-- I never killed nobody neither.


1009
01:02:20.044 --> 01:02:23.714
那又怎样?能有多难?
So what? How hard can it be?


1010
01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:31.656
我是说，我们所做的就是…我们宣读他的权利，然后杀了他。
I mean, all's we do is... we read him his rights and then kill him.


1011
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.827
你在做什么?
What are you doing?


1012
01:02:36.894 --> 01:02:38.829
寻找记录。
Looking for a record.


1013
01:02:38.896 --> 01:02:40.197
妈妈，任何唱片都可以。
Mama, any record will do.


1014
01:02:40.264 --> 01:02:42.266
我在找约翰尼·马西斯。
I'm looking for Johnny Mathis.


1015
01:02:42.332 --> 01:02:43.300
我爱他。
I love him.


1016
01:02:43.367 --> 01:02:44.669
玩这一套。
Play this one.


1017
01:02:44.735 --> 01:02:47.838
什么不，罗莎莉，求你了。
What No, Rosalie, please.


1018
01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:51.008
你知道我喜欢约翰尼·马西斯。
You know I love Johnny Mathis.


1019
01:02:51.075 --> 01:02:55.680
该死的音乐在哪里?
Where's the fucking music?


1020
01:02:55.746 --> 01:02:57.081
我不知道。
I don't know.


1021
01:02:57.147 --> 01:03:00.417
我不想整晚都坐在这里。
I don't want to sit here all night.


1022
01:03:04.221 --> 01:03:05.255
罗莎莉吗?
Rosalie?


1023
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.001
看看这个。
Look at that.


1024
01:03:17.067 --> 01:03:20.304
什么?
What?


1025
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.174
那是雷吉·杰克逊的模型。
That's a Reggie Jackson model.


1026
01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:26.476
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.


1027
01:03:26.543 --> 01:03:28.746
雷吉!
Reggie!


1028
01:03:28.813 --> 01:03:30.214
雷吉!
Reggie!


1029
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.583
雷吉!雷吉!雷吉!
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!


1030
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.985
我爱雷吉。
I love Reggie.


1031
01:03:35.052 --> 01:03:37.254
我也是,男人。他是最伟大的。
Me too, man. He's the greatest.


1032
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:38.455
他打了多少本垒打?
How many homers has he hit?


1033
01:03:38.522 --> 01:03:42.760
我的意思是,一生。
I mean, lifetime.


1034
01:03:42.827 --> 01:03:44.829
他妈的,人。
Shit, man.


1035
01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:48.598
哇。
Wow.


1036
01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:51.769
他妈的。
Fuck.


1037
01:03:51.836 --> 01:03:52.837
一群。
A bunch.


1038
01:03:52.903 --> 01:03:58.675
雷吉!雷吉!雷吉!雷吉!雷吉!
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!


1039
01:03:58.743 --> 01:04:01.211
他们想听雷鬼音乐。
They want to hear reggae music.


1040
01:04:01.278 --> 01:04:02.412
雷鬼音乐吗?是的。
Reggae? Yes.


1041
01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:05.182
不，就在这里的某个地方。我知道是这样。
No, it's right here somewhere. I know it is.


1042
01:04:05.249 --> 01:04:07.785
我在外面等你。
I'll be waiting outside.


1043
01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:09.119
为什么?
Why?


1044
01:04:09.186 --> 01:04:12.823
因为我再也受不了了。
Because I can't stand this anymore.


1045
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:14.158
什么是雷鬼音乐?
What is reggae music?


1046
01:04:22.432 --> 01:04:23.600
我要杀了这家伙。
I'm going to shoot this dude.


1047
01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.169
我等得不耐烦了。
I'm sick of waiting.


1048
01:04:25.235 --> 01:04:28.005
你要在哪里射杀他?
Where you going to shoot him?


1049
01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:29.006
在这里。
Right here.


1050
01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.508
你觉得呢，我要带他去市中心吗?
What do you think, I'm going to take him downtown?


1051
01:04:31.575 --> 01:04:34.912
不。我是说，他身上什么地方?
No. I mean, where on his body?


1052
01:04:34.979 --> 01:04:37.948
嗯，我不知道。我猜是他的心脏。
Well, I don't know. His heart, I guess.


1053
01:04:38.015 --> 01:04:41.385
这是哪一边的?他的心吗?
Which side is that on? His heart?


1054
01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:44.822
哦,狗屎,人。我不知道。
Oh, shit, man. I don't know.


1055
01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:46.757
它就在那里的某个地方。
It's in there somewhere.


1056
01:04:46.824 --> 01:04:49.626
我什么都没听到。
I don't hear nothing.


1057
01:04:49.693 --> 01:04:50.928
等一下。
Wait a minute.


1058
01:04:52.562 --> 01:04:54.131
学校。
School.


1059
01:04:54.198 --> 01:04:55.532
什么?
What?


1060
01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.267
学校，伙计，你知道的。忠诚的承诺。
School, man, you know. Pledge allegiance.


1061
01:04:57.334 --> 01:04:59.636
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.


1062
01:04:59.703 --> 01:05:01.271
交出你的心脏。
Hand over your heart.


1063
01:05:01.338 --> 01:05:03.841
是的,对的。
Yeah, right.


1064
01:05:03.908 --> 01:05:08.678
我宣誓效忠美利坚合众国国旗。
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.


1065
01:05:08.745 --> 01:05:18.745
敬共和国…在一个无形的国家…上帝庇佑下的国家…宽阔的天空和自由的琥珀坟墓……救我们脱离自由。
And to the republic... under one invisible nation... Nations under God whose... Spacious skies and amber graves of liberty for all... Deliver us from freedom.


1066
01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:28.032
哈伦。什么?
Harlan. What?


1067
01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:31.601
我看不下去了，伙计。
I can't watch this, man.


1068
01:05:41.846 --> 01:05:42.880
猫咪。
Pussy.


1069
01:05:45.215 --> 01:05:50.620
这一边。这一边。
This side. This side.


1070
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:07.972
啊!他妈的!
Aah! Fuck!


1071
01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:23.954
你应该在开拍前戴上的!
You were supposed to put it on before the shot!


1072
01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:25.856
是的，他们射得太快了。
Yeah, they shoots too fast.


1073
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:28.292
好吗?
Well?


1074
01:06:28.358 --> 01:06:29.459
好吧,什么?
Well, what?


1075
01:06:29.526 --> 01:06:30.560
他死了吗?
Is he dead?


1076
01:06:30.627 --> 01:06:32.329
他当然死了，伙计。
Of course he's dead, man.


1077
01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:35.299
你觉得呢?
What do you think?


1078
01:06:35.365 --> 01:06:37.167
我拍他。
I shot him.


1079
01:06:47.011 --> 01:06:49.079
怎么了?发生了什么事?
What's the matter? What happened?


1080
01:06:49.146 --> 01:06:51.481
她心烦意乱。
She's upset.


1081
01:06:51.548 --> 01:06:52.983
她会没事的。
She'll be all right.


1082
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.684
我以为她想让他死。
I thought she wanted him dead.


1083
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.487
我们做了什么，伙计?
What did we do, man?


1084
01:06:57.554 --> 01:06:59.223
我们杀错人了吗?
Did we kill the wrong person?


1085
01:06:59.289 --> 01:07:00.424
不,不。
No, no.


1086
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.793
不，她会没事的。
No, she'll be all right.


1087
01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.830
我们现在让她一个人呆着。
We leave her alone now.


1088
01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:10.800
我很震惊，你知道的。
It's the shock, you know.


1089
01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:12.036
音乐。
The music.


1090
01:07:12.102 --> 01:07:13.003
我想喝一杯。
I could use a drink.


1091
01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:13.938
是的。
Yeah.


1092
01:07:14.004 --> 01:07:15.505
是的,好的。是的。哦。
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Ooh.


1093
01:07:15.572 --> 01:07:16.573
好主意。
Good idea.


1094
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.574
来了。
Come.


1095
01:07:29.419 --> 01:07:31.421
我们该为什么干杯?
What should we drink to?


1096
01:07:31.488 --> 01:07:33.257
这是乔伊。
Here's to Joey.


1097
01:07:39.329 --> 01:07:42.632
那很酷。
That's cool.


1098
01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.635
这是错误的。
It's wrong.


1099
01:07:45.702 --> 01:07:47.404
这是错误的。
It's wrong.


1100
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:49.739
哦,亲爱的上帝。
Oh, dear Lord.


1101
01:07:49.806 --> 01:07:53.010
上帝啊，救救我吧。
Oh, please help me, God.


1102
01:07:53.077 --> 01:07:56.546
我真不该这么做。
Oh, I never should have done this thing.


1103
01:07:56.613 --> 01:08:06.490
我不该犯这样的罪。哦……不管你对我做什么，上帝，请把乔伊带回来。
I never should have sinned this way. Ohh... I never-- Whatever you do to me, God, please bring Joey back.


1104
01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:08.858
罗莎莉吗?
Rosalie?


1105
01:08:08.925 --> 01:08:09.826
啊!
Aah!


1106
01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.529
什么
What


1107
01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:18.135
哦!哦!哦!
Oh! Oh! Oh!


1108
01:08:19.469 --> 01:08:21.071
什么…哦!
What...oh!


1109
01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:26.010
什么……你在这里做什么?
What...what are you doing here?


1110
01:08:26.076 --> 01:08:28.312
我在祈祷。
I was praying.


1111
01:08:28.378 --> 01:08:32.149
我以为……祈祷吗?
I thought... Praying?


1112
01:08:32.216 --> 01:08:33.883
是的。
Yeah.


1113
01:08:37.954 --> 01:08:41.891
罗莎莉……我病得没那么严重。
Rosalie...I'm not that sick.


1114
01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:43.994
我得到的是什么?
All I got is what?


1115
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:45.795
一个病毒。这是所有。
A little virus. That's all.


1116
01:08:45.862 --> 01:08:46.796
乔伊。
Joey.


1117
01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:49.133
你怎么还没睡?
What are you doing up?


1118
01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:54.638
我听到了鞭炮之类的声音。
I heard a noise like firecracker or something.


1119
01:08:54.704 --> 01:08:55.672
把我吵醒了。
Woke me up.


1120
01:08:55.739 --> 01:08:57.441
耶稣。
Jesus.


1121
01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:05.049
罗莎莉，你怎么不…?
Rosalie, how come you don't...?


1122
01:09:05.115 --> 01:09:08.352
你知道的…我们有公司。
You know... we have company.


1123
01:09:08.418 --> 01:09:10.187
你没有喂他们。
You're not feeding them.


1124
01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:11.388
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?


1125
01:09:11.455 --> 01:09:15.992
我们家里没吃的了，还是怎么了?
We got no food in the house, or what?


1126
01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.063
他们不饿，乔伊。
They're not hungry, Joey.


1127
01:09:19.129 --> 01:09:21.498
他们不想吃任何东西。
They don't want anything to eat.


1128
01:09:24.934 --> 01:09:29.273
我不知道，我认识所有人吗?
I don't know-- Do I know everybody?


1129
01:09:36.613 --> 01:09:38.315
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.


1130
01:09:40.317 --> 01:09:45.822
嗯…嗯…他是好的吗?
Well...um... Is he okay?


1131
01:09:45.889 --> 01:09:47.191
是的。
Yeah.


1132
01:09:47.257 --> 01:09:48.458
我是马龙
I'm Marlon--


1133
01:09:51.161 --> 01:09:53.597
我是说，我是威廉。
I mean, I'm William.


1134
01:09:53.663 --> 01:09:56.566
我是威廉·布朗。
I'm William Brown.


1135
01:09:56.633 --> 01:10:00.437
我路易……詹姆斯。不。
I'm Louie... James. No.


1136
01:10:00.504 --> 01:10:03.173
不,等等。
No, wait.


1137
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.510
路易……史密斯吗?
Louie... Smith?


1138
01:10:06.576 --> 01:10:08.212
史密斯。
Smith.


1139
01:10:08.278 --> 01:10:09.846
乔伊的披萨。
Joey's Pizza.


1140
01:10:14.351 --> 01:10:17.787
一些奶酪和饼干?
Some cheese and crackers?


1141
01:10:17.854 --> 01:10:21.725
来点椒盐卷饼吧?
Maybe some pretzels, huh?


1142
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:25.295
你感觉怎么样，乔伊?
How are you feeling, Joey?


1143
01:10:25.362 --> 01:10:26.196
你还好吗?
You feeling all right?


1144
01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:29.333
谢谢你！
Thank you.


1145
01:10:34.138 --> 01:10:35.339
什么?
What?


1146
01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:38.074
感觉好吗?
Feeling okay?


1147
01:10:38.142 --> 01:10:44.114
嗯…不，我不觉得很热。不。
Uh... No, I don't feel so hot. No.


1148
01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:01.097
你好,Devo。
Hello, Devo.


1149
01:11:04.033 --> 01:11:04.934
蜂蜜。
Honey.


1150
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:07.137
乔伊……你不应该下床。
Joey...you shouldn't be out of bed.


1151
01:11:07.204 --> 01:11:09.206
你感染了严重的病毒
You got a bad virus.


1152
01:11:09.273 --> 01:11:11.275
来吧。
Come on.


1153
01:11:11.341 --> 01:11:12.876
你告诉我。
You're telling me.


1154
01:11:12.942 --> 01:11:17.447
这种病毒会要了我的命
It's killing me, this virus.


1155
01:11:17.514 --> 01:11:20.850
好了，大家晚安。
Well, good night, everybody.


1156
01:11:24.087 --> 01:11:25.155
哎呦。
Whoops.


1157
01:11:25.222 --> 01:11:27.457
乔伊，把裤子穿好。
Joey, pull your pants up.


1158
01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:32.696
很高兴认识你。
Nice to meet you.


1159
01:11:34.598 --> 01:11:35.565
你确定他们不饿吗?
You sure they're not hungry?


1160
01:11:35.632 --> 01:11:37.701
我肯定,宝贝。
I'm positive, baby.


1161
01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:40.570
我们可以派人去买中国菜。
We could send out for Chinese.


1162
01:11:40.637 --> 01:11:42.272
不，他们什么都不想要。
No, they don't want anything.


1163
01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:45.175
我们有意大利面条。
We got spaghetti.


1164
01:11:45.242 --> 01:11:48.878
我很失望。
I am very disappointed.


1165
01:11:48.945 --> 01:11:52.649
好男人。
Nice guys.


1166
01:11:53.717 --> 01:11:54.718
哦,你没事吧?
Ooh, you okay?


1167
01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.085
什么?
What?


1168
01:11:58.054 --> 01:11:59.689
我们还有肉丸吗?
We got any meatballs left?


1169
01:11:59.756 --> 01:12:01.825
什么，你饿了吗?
What, are you hungry?


1170
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:03.092
可以吃点东西。
Could eat a little something.


1171
01:12:03.159 --> 01:12:06.162
你知道的，让我恢复体力。
You know, get my strength back.


1172
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.199
来吧。对不起。
Come on. Sorry.


1173
01:12:09.266 --> 01:12:11.568
现在几点了?
What time is it?


1174
01:12:11.635 --> 01:12:12.802
这是晚了。
It's late.


1175
01:12:12.869 --> 01:12:17.173
你应该试着睡觉。
You should try to sleep.


1176
01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:20.710
好好照顾我，罗莎莉。
You take good care of me, Rosalie.


1177
01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:25.215
我知道你喜欢。
I know you do.


1178
01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:28.818
你是我的丈夫。
You're my husband.


1179
01:12:28.885 --> 01:12:30.887
罗莎莉。
Rosalie.


1180
01:12:30.954 --> 01:12:33.523
是吗?
Yeah?


1181
01:12:38.695 --> 01:12:40.397
哦,乔伊,没有。
Oh, Joey, no.


1182
01:12:40.464 --> 01:12:43.833
不,不是现在。来吧。
No, not now. Come on.


1183
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.803
静静地躺着，好吗?
Just lie quietly, okay?


1184
01:12:58.415 --> 01:12:59.583
这只有200。
This is only 200.


1185
01:12:59.649 --> 01:13:02.018
他们答应给我们五个。
We was promised five.


1186
01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:02.986
因为杀了他，五。
For killing him, five.


1187
01:13:03.052 --> 01:13:05.054
因为伤了他，2分。
For wounding him, two.


1188
01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:07.891
你想让我杀了他，对吧?
Well, you wanted me to shoot him, right?


1189
01:13:07.957 --> 01:13:09.359
所以我开枪打了他。
So I shot him.


1190
01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:14.097
你把他吵醒了。那有什么好处?
You woke him up. What good is that?


1191
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:26.943
好的。
Okay.


1192
01:13:37.687 --> 01:13:41.891
下次再这样做，我们会提前拿到钱的。
Next time we do this, we're going to get paid in advance.


1193
01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:46.496
如果我们继续朝乔伊开枪，你不觉得他会起疑心吗?
If we keep shooting Joey, don't you think he might get suspicious?


1194
01:13:48.565 --> 01:13:50.534
拉里。
Larry.


1195
01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:57.140
把你跟我说的告诉他。
Tell him what you told me.


1196
01:13:57.206 --> 01:13:58.308
我想做笔交易。
I want to make a deal.


1197
01:13:58.375 --> 01:14:00.344
不是那个，是另一件事。
Not that, the other thing.


1198
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:02.011
我的牢房没有足够的热量。
There's not enough heat in my cell.


1199
01:14:02.078 --> 01:14:04.781
不，是哈兰和马龙。
No, Harlan and Marlon.


1200
01:14:04.848 --> 01:14:06.416
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.


1201
01:14:06.483 --> 01:14:07.651
哈兰·詹姆斯和他的表姐马龙。
Harlan James and his cousin Marlon.


1202
01:14:07.717 --> 01:14:12.489
我听说他们花了很多钱去袭击乔伊·博卡。
I heard they was paid a lot of money to hit Joey Boca.


1203
01:14:12.556 --> 01:14:17.494
乔伊·博卡，我不知道。我是这么听说的，你知道吗?
Joey Boca I don't know. That's what I heard, you know?


1204
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:20.697
哈伦和马龙给每个人买酒，然后炫耀。
Harlan and Marlon was buying drinks for everyone and bragging on it.


1205
01:14:20.764 --> 01:14:25.234
说他们杀了那家伙。说他们有五千美元。
Said they shot the dude. Said they got $5,000.


1206
01:14:41.317 --> 01:14:43.086
有点晚了。也许他们是睡着了。
It's kind of late. Maybe they're asleep.


1207
01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:46.523
我最好的答案。我不得不这么做。
I'd better answer. I have to.


1208
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:53.397
不。不。罗莎莉……听着，不管发生什么，让我来跟你谈。
No. No. Rosalie... Now, look, whatever happens, let me do the talking.


1209
01:14:53.463 --> 01:14:55.131
妈妈，我不想让你说什么。
Mama, I don't want you to say anything.


1210
01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:56.165
什么?
What?


1211
01:14:56.232 --> 01:14:57.667
你太,Devo。
You too, Devo.


1212
01:14:57.734 --> 01:14:59.102
没必要每个人都惹上麻烦。
There's no sense everyone getting in trouble.


1213
01:14:59.168 --> 01:15:01.571
但我不想你惹上麻烦。
But I don't want you to get in trouble.


1214
01:15:01.638 --> 01:15:06.109
总之，乔伊没死，你知道的。
Anyway, Joey's not dead, you know.


1215
01:15:06.175 --> 01:15:09.413
我们所做的就是让他睡着，然后叫醒他几次。
All we did was put him to sleep and wake him up a few times.


1216
01:15:09.479 --> 01:15:10.847
妈妈，他中了两枪。
Mama, he has two bullets in him.


1217
01:15:10.914 --> 01:15:12.682
他可能要死了。
He could be dying.


1218
01:15:12.749 --> 01:15:14.884
那他为什么想吃肉丸呢?
So how come he wants meatballs?


1219
01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:23.727
晚上,罗莎莉。
Evening, Rosalie.


1220
01:15:23.793 --> 01:15:26.496
是错了吗?
Is something wrong?


1221
01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:27.664
我们可以进来吗?
May we come in?


1222
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.499
哦，你是说现在?
Oh, you mean now?


1223
01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:31.100
我们想见乔伊。
We'd like to see Joey.


1224
01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:32.636
乔伊?
Joey?


1225
01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.438
你的丈夫。乔伊。
Your husband. Joey.


1226
01:15:34.504 --> 01:15:38.408
哦,是的,乔伊。哦,乔伊。
Oh, yeah, Joey. Oh, Joey.


1227
01:15:38.475 --> 01:15:40.376
他现在不太舒服。
Uh, well, he's not feeling well right now.


1228
01:15:40.444 --> 01:15:43.079
你过几天再来吧?
Maybe you could come back in a couple of days?


1229
01:15:43.146 --> 01:15:44.313
乔伊非常恶心。
Joey very sick.


1230
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.415
你改天再来吧。
You come back some other time.


1231
01:15:45.482 --> 01:15:47.451
我们今晚想见见他。
We'd like to see him tonight.


1232
01:15:47.517 --> 01:15:48.985
可能明天吧。
Maybe tomorrow.


1233
01:15:49.052 --> 01:15:53.256
罗莎莉，如果有必要，我们会带着搜查令回来。
Rosalie, if we have to, we'll come back with a warrant.


1234
01:15:57.393 --> 01:15:59.395
乔伊?
Joey?


1235
01:15:59.463 --> 01:16:03.733
嘿，拉里，你好吗?
Hey, Larry, how you doing?


1236
01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:07.804
你对吧?
You all right?


1237
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:09.939
我染上了点病毒
I got a little virus.


1238
01:16:10.006 --> 01:16:11.107
一个病毒?
A virus?


1239
01:16:11.174 --> 01:16:13.543
是的某种病毒
Yes, some kind of virus.


1240
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:16.212
我头痛。
I got a headache.


1241
01:16:16.279 --> 01:16:18.281
你介意我开灯吗?
You mind if I turn on the light?


1242
01:16:18.347 --> 01:16:20.784
当然。去做吧。
Sure. Go ahead.


1243
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.587
我认为你不应该。
I don't think you should.


1244
01:16:23.653 --> 01:16:24.954
就一会儿。
Just for a second.


1245
01:16:25.021 --> 01:16:25.989
不管怎样，这是行不通的。
It doesn't work, anyway.


1246
01:16:26.055 --> 01:16:27.190
哦。
Oh.


1247
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:36.165
让你舒适舒适。
Get you nice and comfortable.


1248
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:40.369
对不起,罗莎莉。请原谅我。
Excuse me, Rosalie. Excuse me, please.


1249
01:16:40.436 --> 01:16:44.474
请原谅我。谢谢你！
Please, excuse me. Thank you.


1250
01:16:53.416 --> 01:16:54.450
耶稣。
Jesus.


1251
01:16:54.518 --> 01:16:56.285
什么?
What?


1252
01:16:56.352 --> 01:16:58.121
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell's going on here?


1253
01:16:58.187 --> 01:17:00.790
他头部中枪了。
He's been shot in the head.


1254
01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:03.493
真的吗?什么?
Really? What?


1255
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.662
难怪他头疼。
No wonder he has headache.


1256
01:17:05.729 --> 01:17:08.665
头痛吗?他身上有颗子弹。
Headache? He's got a bullet in him.


1257
01:17:08.732 --> 01:17:11.901
卡洛斯，马上叫辆救护车过来。
Carlos, get an ambulance over here right away.


1258
01:17:11.968 --> 01:17:14.671
Devo !
Devo!


1259
01:17:14.738 --> 01:17:17.340
我想给乔伊拿个创可贴。
I was going to get a Band-Aid for Joey.


1260
01:17:19.475 --> 01:17:21.377
我是卡洛斯·威利警探。
Yeah, this is Detective Carlos Wiley.


1261
01:17:21.444 --> 01:17:23.947
我在北C区424号，跟"查理"一样
I'm at 424 North C, as in "Charlie."


1262
01:17:24.013 --> 01:17:27.250
不是我们干的。我对天发誓我们没有。
We didn't do it. I swear to God we didn't.


1263
01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:30.019
我们在外面的草坪上发现了他。
We found him outside on the lawn.


1264
01:17:30.086 --> 01:17:31.655
是的。他躺在那里。
Yeah. He was lying there.


1265
01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:34.658
有人朝他开枪，把他扔在草地上。
Someone had shot him and thrown him on the lawn.


1266
01:17:34.724 --> 01:17:35.792
真是一团糟。
It was a mess.


1267
01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:39.696
太可怕了，所以我们……我们把他带进屋，放在床上。
It was terrible, so we... we brought him inside and we put him in bed.


1268
01:17:39.763 --> 01:17:40.830
是的，就像你看到的。
Yeah, like you see.


1269
01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:42.098
肯定是黑手党干的。
And it must have been the Mafia.


1270
01:17:42.165 --> 01:17:43.166
黑手党吗?
Mafia?


1271
01:17:43.232 --> 01:17:45.034
黑手党。
The Mafia.


1272
01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:46.736
乔伊是意大利人。
Yeah, Joey was Italian.


1273
01:17:46.803 --> 01:17:48.004
他是意大利人。
He is Italian.


1274
01:17:48.071 --> 01:17:51.374
罗莎莉，你为什么不送他去医院?
Rosalie, why didn't you take him to the hospital?


1275
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.508
他不想去。
He didn't want to go.


1276
01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:53.977
他觉得不能胜任。
He wasn't feeling up to it.


1277
01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:02.385
乔伊，你不想去医院吗?
Joey, you didn't want to go to the hospital?


1278
01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:05.154
不。为什么，因为病毒?
No. Why, for a virus?


1279
01:18:15.799 --> 01:18:17.400
罗莎莉。不要告诉罗莎莉。
Rosalie. Don't tell Rosalie.


1280
01:18:42.859 --> 01:18:45.428
你给他吃了多少瓶药?
How many bottles of pills did you give him?


1281
01:18:45.494 --> 01:18:49.098
我给了他两瓶。一,二。
I gave him two bottles. One, two.


1282
01:18:49.165 --> 01:18:53.737
哈伦和马龙说德沃第一次开枪打了他。
Harlan and Marlon say Devo shot him the first time.


1283
01:18:53.803 --> 01:18:55.038
是这样吗?
Is that right?


1284
01:18:55.104 --> 01:18:57.807
如果不是我，戴沃根本不会在那里。
Devo wouldn't even have been there if it wasn't for me.


1285
01:18:57.874 --> 01:18:59.809
你是什么意思?
How do you mean?


1286
01:18:59.876 --> 01:19:03.847
我想杀了乔伊。德沃跟这事无关。
I wanted to kill Joey. Devo had nothing to do with it.


1287
01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:06.049
德沃到底有没有朝他开枪?
Did Devo shoot him or not?


1288
01:19:06.115 --> 01:19:07.316
德沃怎么说?
What does Devo say?


1289
01:19:07.383 --> 01:19:08.551
别管他。你说呢?
Never mind him. What do you say?


1290
01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:11.387
它不是Devo。这是我。
It wasn't Devo. It was me.


1291
01:19:11.454 --> 01:19:18.294
我第一次开枪打了他，然后…谁杀了他?让我看看。这是马龙。
I shot him the first time, and then... Who shot him? Let me see. It was Marlon.


1292
01:19:18.361 --> 01:19:20.529
不,不。哈伦。哈伦。
No, no. Harlan. Harlan.


1293
01:19:20.596 --> 01:19:22.565
你确定吗?
Are you sure?


1294
01:19:22.632 --> 01:19:25.935
是的,我肯定。为什么?你觉得是谁杀了他?
Yeah, I'm sure. Why? Who do you think shot him?


1295
01:19:26.002 --> 01:19:27.103
你妈妈呢?
What about your mother?


1296
01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:30.106
她跟这事一点关系都没有。什么都没有。
She had nothing to do with it. Nothing.


1297
01:19:30.173 --> 01:19:32.976
是的，我杀了他。是的。
Yes, I shoot him. Yes.


1298
01:19:33.042 --> 01:19:36.245
你知道为什么吗?他是个没用的混蛋。
You know why? He is no-good son of a bitch.


1299
01:19:36.312 --> 01:19:37.814
谁给他的药?
Who gave him the pills?


1300
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:39.448
我做到了。你觉得呢?
I did. What do you think?


1301
01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:41.851
我先给他安眠药，然后杀了他。
First I give him sleeping pills, then I shoot him.


1302
01:19:41.918 --> 01:19:43.653
你想让我认罪?
You want me to confess?


1303
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.421
给我一张纸。我承认。
Give me piece of paper. I confess.


1304
01:19:45.488 --> 01:19:47.156
罗莎莉呢?
What about Rosalie?


1305
01:19:47.223 --> 01:19:49.092
罗莎莉吗?她什么也不做。
Rosalie? She does nothing.


1306
01:19:49.158 --> 01:19:50.526
不，我什么都做。
No, I do everything.


1307
01:19:50.593 --> 01:19:53.897
我给他吃药，开枪，什么都做。
I give him pills, I shoot him, everything.


1308
01:19:53.963 --> 01:19:56.499
你这么做的时候，你女儿在做什么?
And while you were doing this, what was your daughter doing?


1309
01:19:56.565 --> 01:20:01.404
她求我停下来。
She was begging me to stop.


1310
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:05.541
但我还是做了，你知道为什么吗?
But I do it anyway, and you know why?


1311
01:20:05.608 --> 01:20:09.312
我是她的妈妈。我做我喜欢做的事。
I am her mother. I do what I like.


1312
01:20:09.378 --> 01:20:11.815
我以为德沃第一次开枪打了他。
I thought Devo shot him the first time.


1313
01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:13.717
Devo吗?
Devo?


1314
01:20:13.783 --> 01:20:15.985
哦,不。你一定是在开玩笑。
Oh, no. You must be joking.


1315
01:20:16.052 --> 01:20:17.453
不，德沃是个好孩子。
No, Devo's very nice boy.


1316
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.056
他不会开枪的。
He wouldn't shoot nobody.


1317
01:20:20.123 --> 01:20:23.592
我不明白你为什么要把责任推到罗莎莉身上。
I don't understand why you're trying to blame it on Rosalie.


1318
01:20:23.659 --> 01:20:25.394
也许是我干的。
Maybe I did it.


1319
01:20:25.461 --> 01:20:26.963
也许我很高兴我这么做了。
Maybe I'm glad I did it.


1320
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.832
你是说是你干的?
Are you saying you did it?


1321
01:20:28.898 --> 01:20:29.999
不，他没这么说。
No, he's not saying that.


1322
01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:31.300
他说了什么?
What's he saying?


1323
01:20:31.367 --> 01:20:36.072
他什么也没说。
He's not saying anything.


1324
01:20:36.139 --> 01:20:38.041
我知道怎么开枪。
I know how to fire a gun.


1325
01:20:38.107 --> 01:20:40.076
我哥哥是国民警卫队的。
My brother was in the National Guard.


1326
01:20:40.143 --> 01:20:41.711
你是什么意思?
So what are you saying?


1327
01:20:41.778 --> 01:20:48.752
他说他哥哥是个爱国的美国人。
He's saying that his brother is a patriotic American.


1328
01:20:57.126 --> 01:20:59.062
博卡女士，这是冲动犯罪吗?
Ms. Boca, was it a crime of passion?


1329
01:20:59.128 --> 01:21:02.198
看看这些人。
Look at all these people.


1330
01:21:02.265 --> 01:21:04.433
罗莎莉，是我，托尼。你能告诉我什么?
Rosalie, it's me, Tony. What can you tell me?


1331
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.035
妈妈，记住，你跟这事无关。
Mama, remember, you had nothing to do with it.


1332
01:21:06.102 --> 01:21:10.473
今晚我跟你打赌我们会上电视，你和我。
Tonight I bet you anything we'll be on TV, you and me.


1333
01:21:10.539 --> 01:21:12.008
你能想象吗?
Can you imagine?


1334
01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.744
罗莎莉，你能给我们录一份口供吗?
Rosalie, can you give us a statement?


1335
01:21:19.182 --> 01:21:21.584
Devo。德沃，你能告诉我们什么?
Devo. Devo, what can you tell us?


1336
01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:22.919
发生了什么事?
What happened?


1337
01:21:22.986 --> 01:21:24.187
黑手党真的参与其中吗?
Is it true that the Mafia involved?


1338
01:21:24.253 --> 01:21:25.221
我现在没什么可说的。
I have nothing to say at this time.


1339
01:21:25.288 --> 01:21:26.622
无可奉告。
No comment.


1340
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:28.391
你呢，先生?
What about you, sir?


1341
01:21:28.457 --> 01:21:30.159
离我远点。
Get the fuck away from me.


1342
01:21:30.226 --> 01:21:32.128
乔伊呢?他死了吗?
What about Joey? Is he dead, or what?


1343
01:21:32.195 --> 01:21:34.697
乔伊是谁?
Who's Joey?


1344
01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:37.300
你知道的，那个人。那个家伙。
You know, the guy. The guy.


1345
01:21:37.366 --> 01:21:39.168
对，就是那个人。
Oh, yeah, the guy.


1346
01:21:39.235 --> 01:21:40.103
他妈的。
Fuck.


1347
01:21:40.169 --> 01:21:41.337
他还活着。
He's still alive.


1348
01:21:41.404 --> 01:21:42.738
为什么?你知道些什么?
Why? What do you know about it?


1349
01:21:42.806 --> 01:21:46.009
哦,没什么。
Oh, nothing.


1350
01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:00.023
罗莎莉……
Rosalie...


1351
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.341
莱西。
Lacey.


1352
01:22:18.407 --> 01:22:20.009
你过得如何?
How you doing?


1353
01:22:20.076 --> 01:22:22.045
嗨,乔伊。你感觉如何?
Hi, Joey. How do you feel?


1354
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:30.419
你该看看外面那些记者。
You should see all the reporters outside.


1355
01:22:30.486 --> 01:22:33.222
你会很出名的。
You're going to be so famous.


1356
01:22:33.289 --> 01:22:35.892
我甚至听说《人物》杂志要采访你。
I even heard People magazine was going to interview you.


1357
01:22:35.959 --> 01:22:36.792
蕾西，你现在不该来这里。
Lacey, you shouldn't be here now.


1358
01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.394
它是不正确的。
It's not right.


1359
01:22:38.461 --> 01:22:41.764
但医生说你一周后就能出院了。
But the doctor said you're going to be out in a week.


1360
01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:51.831
听着,宝贝…当有人朝你的头开枪…它让你思考。
Listen, baby... when somebody shoot you in the head... it makes you think.


1361
01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:58.681
我最近想了很多很多很多我不能再浪费时间了。
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, a whole lot, and... I can't mess around anymore.


1362
01:22:58.747 --> 01:23:00.149
我必须成为，你知道的，一个好丈夫。
I've got to be, you know, a good husband.


1363
01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:02.785
从现在开始，我要认真对待我的婚姻。
From now on, I've got to take my marriage a little more serious.


1364
01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:03.953
你明白我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?


1365
01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.289
乔伊，你在说什么?
Joey, what are you saying?


1366
01:23:06.355 --> 01:23:08.992
她射杀你。两次。
She shot you. Twice.


1367
01:23:09.058 --> 01:23:10.559
不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no.


1368
01:23:10.626 --> 01:23:13.997
她自己根本没朝我开枪。
She never shot me herself, per se.


1369
01:23:14.063 --> 01:23:17.766
那我们呢?
So what about us?


1370
01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:22.271
这就是我想告诉你的。
That's what I'm trying to tell you.


1371
01:23:22.338 --> 01:23:26.742
现在一切都结束了。
That's all over now.


1372
01:23:26.809 --> 01:23:29.778
我一直跟你说我爱我妻子。
I always told you I loved my wife.


1373
01:23:33.316 --> 01:23:35.384
乔伊，这女人是谁?
Joey, who is this woman?


1374
01:23:37.987 --> 01:23:41.224
妈妈，这是蕾西。
Mama, this is Lacey.


1375
01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:42.258
她是我的一个朋友。
She's a friend of mine.


1376
01:23:42.325 --> 01:23:45.294
我的乔伊得休息了。
My Joey has to get his rest.


1377
01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:46.963
你现在不应该在这里。
You shouldn't be here now.


1378
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.964
我正要走。
I was just leaving.


1379
01:23:48.031 --> 01:23:49.999
很好。刚刚离开。
Good. Just leave.


1380
01:23:50.066 --> 01:23:51.467
反正你也不属于这里。
You don't belong here anyway.


1381
01:23:51.534 --> 01:23:53.136
你不是他的妻子。
You're not his wife.


1382
01:23:56.105 --> 01:23:58.574
待会儿见，乔伊。
I'll see you later, Joey.


1383
01:24:15.091 --> 01:24:17.593
你今天感觉怎么样?
How are you feeling today?


1384
01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:23.866
好的,妈妈,更好。
Okay, Mama, better.


1385
01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:26.769
我今早和罗莎莉谈过了。
I spoke to Rosalie this morning.


1386
01:24:26.835 --> 01:24:30.806
你做了吗?她跟你说了什么?
You did? What did she tell you?


1387
01:24:30.873 --> 01:24:34.110
她告诉我什么了?
What did she tell me?


1388
01:24:34.177 --> 01:24:37.346
她告诉了我真相。
She told me the truth.


1389
01:24:37.413 --> 01:24:40.216
你怎么了，你这个大人物?
What's the matter with you, you big shot?


1390
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:41.184
欺骗你的妻子。
Cheating on your wife.


1391
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.851
Ai,妈妈!
Ai, Mama!


1392
01:24:42.918 --> 01:24:47.090
拜托，我脑袋里有颗子弹。
Please, I got a bullet in my head.


1393
01:24:47.156 --> 01:24:48.958
你脑袋里应该有两颗子弹。
You should have two bullets in your head.


1394
01:24:49.025 --> 01:24:50.293
三颗子弹!四子弹!
Three bullets! Four bullets!


1395
01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:53.062
人工智能!妈妈，求你了，我很抱歉。
Ai! Mama, please, I'm so sorry.


1396
01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:54.297
我能说什么呢?
What can I say?


1397
01:24:56.432 --> 01:25:01.004
你不告诉我你很抱歉。
You no tell me you're sorry.


1398
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:02.305
不。不。
No. No.


1399
01:25:02.371 --> 01:25:05.975
你告诉罗莎莉。
You tell Rosalie.


1400
01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:08.444
是啊，好主意。当然,是的。
Oh, si, good idea. Sure, yeah.


1401
01:25:08.511 --> 01:25:14.650
否则，我就揍你一顿…好的。
Otherwise, I give you such a beating... Okay.


1402
01:25:14.717 --> 01:25:19.055
妈妈，这是个好主意。
Mama, that's a good idea.


1403
01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:23.426
哦,不。
Oh, no.


1404
01:25:23.492 --> 01:25:26.429
妈妈……
Mama...


1405
01:25:33.269 --> 01:25:35.238
人工智能!
Ai!


1406
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:47.750
你怎么能把她保释出来?
How can you bail her out?


1407
01:25:47.816 --> 01:25:48.884
你不明白这意味着什么吗?
Don't you see what that means?


1408
01:25:48.951 --> 01:25:51.887
这意味着她可以回家了。
It means she can come home.


1409
01:25:51.954 --> 01:25:54.957
在医院里，你说你会起诉。
In the hospital, you said you'd prosecute.


1410
01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:57.493
我知道,拉里。我改变主意了。
I know, Larry. I changed my mind.


1411
01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.861
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


1412
01:25:58.927 --> 01:26:02.398
过去几周我学到了很多。
I learned a lot in the last few weeks.


1413
01:26:02.465 --> 01:26:05.368
你心里不会有复仇的念头吧，乔伊?
You wouldn't have revenge on your mind, would you, Joey?


1414
01:26:05.434 --> 01:26:08.037
她是我的妻子。
She's my wife.


1415
01:26:08.104 --> 01:26:10.673
我想带她回家。
I want to bring her home.


1416
01:26:10.739 --> 01:26:11.774
我爱她。
I love her.


1417
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.975
你明白吗?
You understand?


1418
01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:15.010
她不应该进监狱。
She shouldn't be in prison.


1419
01:26:15.078 --> 01:26:17.213
她是我孩子的母亲。
She's the mother of my children.


1420
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:22.751
也许她有很多想杀我的理由。
Maybe she had plenty of good reasons for trying to kill me.


1421
01:26:22.818 --> 01:26:24.053
你想过吗?
You ever think of that?


1422
01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.822
乔，假设她再试一次。
Joe, suppose she tries again.


1423
01:26:26.889 --> 01:26:27.890
她可以，你知道的。
She could, you know.


1424
01:26:27.956 --> 01:26:31.727
是的,她可以。
Yeah, she could.


1425
01:26:31.794 --> 01:26:34.063
你知道罗莎莉。
You know Rosalie.


1426
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:40.703
当她恋爱时，她就是个十足的疯子。
When she's in love, she's a complete maniac.


1427
01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:51.414
别为了妈妈把衣服弄湿了。
Don't get your dress wet for Mommy.


1428
01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.150
我不会的。
I won't.


1429
01:27:12.901 --> 01:27:14.470
嘿,Devo !
Hey, Devo!


1430
01:27:17.406 --> 01:27:18.674
Devo !
Devo!


1431
01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:20.008
你好吗?
How are you?


1432
01:27:20.075 --> 01:27:22.811
Devo吗?
Devo?


1433
01:27:31.887 --> 01:27:36.425
等待,马龙……看看谁来了。
Wait, Marlon... look who's here.


1434
01:27:36.492 --> 01:27:37.860
嘿,哇。
Hey, wow.


1435
01:27:37.926 --> 01:27:39.662
你过得如何?
How you doing?


1436
01:27:39.728 --> 01:27:40.929
我很好。
I'm okay.


1437
01:27:40.996 --> 01:27:43.098
这是谁?
Who is this?


1438
01:27:45.968 --> 01:27:47.603
这是乔伊。
This is Joey.


1439
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:48.671
乔伊?
Joey?


1440
01:27:48.737 --> 01:27:51.440
你知道的，那个人。
You know, the guy.


1441
01:27:51.507 --> 01:27:54.009
那个家伙。
The guy.


1442
01:27:54.076 --> 01:27:59.482
哦。哇。乔伊。
Oh. Wow. Joey.


1443
01:28:00.783 --> 01:28:02.651
你保释了我们。
You bailed us out.


1444
01:28:02.718 --> 01:28:04.653
是的，我保释了所有人。
Yeah, I bail out everybody.


1445
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.623
我想重新开始，把往事一笔勾销。
I want to make a new start, wipe the slate clean.


1446
01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:10.326
我听说他们可能会指控我们谋杀未遂。
I hear they may charge us with attempted murder.


1447
01:28:10.393 --> 01:28:12.661
不,不,不。我不会起诉的。
No, no, no. I'm not going to prosecute.


1448
01:28:12.728 --> 01:28:16.165
如果我起诉你，他们也会把罗莎莉关进监狱。
See, if I prosecute you, they're going to put Rosalie in jail too.


1449
01:28:16.232 --> 01:28:17.466
我不想那样。
I don't want that.


1450
01:28:17.533 --> 01:28:19.067
不，没有我，他们就没有案子。
No, without me, they got no case.


1451
01:28:19.134 --> 01:28:20.169
别担心。
Don't worry.


1452
01:28:20.236 --> 01:28:25.308
发生的这一切，不是针对你的。
Hey, you know, what happened, it wasn't personal or anything.


1453
01:28:25.374 --> 01:28:26.709
是的。
Yeah.


1454
01:28:26.775 --> 01:28:31.214
正确的。我的意思是……我们甚至都不认识你。
Right. I mean... we didn't even know you or anything.


1455
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.883
是啊，我们不是朋友，就像现在。
Yeah, we weren't friends or anything, like now.


1456
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:40.389
不。不。这样见面不太好。
No. No. It wasn't the best way to meet.


1457
01:28:40.456 --> 01:28:46.028
我们最好在他们改变主意之前离开这里。
We'd better get out of here, you know, before they change their mind.


1458
01:28:46.094 --> 01:28:48.931
是的。正确的。
Yeah. Right.


1459
01:28:48.997 --> 01:28:51.900
这么久,乔伊。
So long, Joey.


1460
01:28:51.967 --> 01:28:53.135
我想我们会再见的。
I guess we'll see you around.


1461
01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:55.638
好的。
Okay.


1462
01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:03.512
哦，多好的人啊。
Oh, what a nice guy.


1463
01:29:03.579 --> 01:29:04.613
是的。
Yeah.


1464
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.982
罗莎莉是谁?
Who's Rosalie?


1465
01:29:12.821 --> 01:29:18.160
乔伊，我对发生的事非常非常抱歉。
Joey, I'm really, really sorry about what happened.


1466
01:29:22.465 --> 01:29:25.568
你很久以前就想告诉我了，德沃。
You tried to tell me a long time ago, Devo.


1467
01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:28.070
我应该听你的。
I should have listened to you.


1468
01:29:28.136 --> 01:29:29.572
我没有好好对待罗莎莉。
I wasn't treating Rosalie right.


1469
01:29:29.638 --> 01:29:31.607
罗莎莉是个很棒的女人。
Rosalie is a wonderful lady.


1470
01:29:31.674 --> 01:29:34.443
我知道。我要补偿她。
I know. I'm going to make it up to her.


1471
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:35.378
好。
Good.


1472
01:29:35.444 --> 01:29:37.380
谢谢你救我出来。
Thanks for bailing me out.


1473
01:29:37.446 --> 01:29:38.814
当然,当然。
Sure, sure.


1474
01:29:38.881 --> 01:29:41.016
别再朝我脑袋开枪了，好吗?
Just no more shooting me in the head, okay?


1475
01:29:41.083 --> 01:29:44.052
为什么不呢?这似乎有所帮助。
Why not? It seems to have helped.


1476
01:29:44.119 --> 01:29:46.355
这是事实。
It's the truth.


1477
01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:50.626
我头上挨了一枪，感觉好极了。
I got a bullet in my head, I never felt better.


1478
01:29:57.833 --> 01:29:59.368
嗨,妈妈。
Hi, Mom.


1479
01:30:00.336 --> 01:30:02.605
哦,我的孩子!
Oh, my babies!


1480
01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:06.742
哦,多米尼克,多米尼克。
Oh, Dominic, Dominic.


1481
01:30:06.809 --> 01:30:10.813
别担心，我们很安全。
Don't worry, we're safe.


1482
01:30:10.879 --> 01:30:12.515
别担心。
Don't worry.


1483
01:30:19.388 --> 01:30:20.723
那么，你想要什么?
So, what do you want?


1484
01:30:20.789 --> 01:30:26.128
我很抱歉对你女儿这么不好。
I'm sorry I treat your daughter so bad.


1485
01:30:26.194 --> 01:30:32.100
我打破了我的结婚誓言……但我再也不会破坏任何东西了，我发誓。
I broke my marriage vows... but I don't break nothing ever again, I swear.


1486
01:30:32.167 --> 01:30:35.871
这糖果是给我的吗?
And this is for me, this candy?


1487
01:30:35.938 --> 01:30:39.408
好吧,我……是的,谢谢你。
Well, I... Yeah, thank you.


1488
01:30:39.475 --> 01:30:40.576
你真是个好孩子。
You're very good boy.


1489
01:30:40.643 --> 01:30:44.112
是啊，我曾经喜欢过你。
Yeah, you know, I liked you once.


1490
01:30:44.179 --> 01:30:50.353
也许我又喜欢上你了…只是巧克力不是我的最爱。
Maybe I like you again... except chocolate is not my favorite.


1491
01:30:50.419 --> 01:30:52.655
我喜欢硬糖。
I like hard candy.


1492
01:30:52.721 --> 01:30:56.692
好吧，我会记得的不不不。我暂时留着这个。
Well, I'll remember-- No, no, no, no. I keep this for now.


1493
01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.795
太好了。我等不及要回家了。
Great. I can't wait to get home.


1494
01:30:59.862 --> 01:31:01.730
多米尼克。多米尼克,来了。
Dominic. Dominic, come.


1495
01:31:01.797 --> 01:31:03.566
你跟我来。
You come with me.


1496
01:31:03.632 --> 01:31:06.669
跟我来，我给你一些我的糖果。
Come with me, I give you some of my candy.


1497
01:31:09.204 --> 01:31:12.040
我们去找德沃。来了。
We go find Devo. Come.


1498
01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:27.790
这是什么?
What's this?


1499
01:31:27.856 --> 01:31:29.358
你送我花干什么?
What are you giving me flowers for?


1500
01:31:34.963 --> 01:31:36.465
我想让你再嫁给我一次。
I want you to marry me again.


1501
01:31:36.532 --> 01:31:37.500
什么?
What?


1502
01:31:37.566 --> 01:31:41.003
新的婚姻，新的生活。
A new marriage, new life.


1503
01:31:41.069 --> 01:31:44.206
我们有一个盛大的仪式。
We have big ceremony.


1504
01:31:48.276 --> 01:31:49.645
你觉得我会犯同样的错误吗?
You think I'm going to make the same mistake?


1505
01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:51.079
我们还没离婚呢。
We're not even divorced yet.


1506
01:31:51.146 --> 01:31:53.081
你怎么能再娶我?
How can you marry me again?


1507
01:31:53.148 --> 01:31:54.550
罗西!罗西!
Rosie! Rosie!


1508
01:31:57.686 --> 01:32:00.523
请过来一下。
Come here, please.


1509
01:32:00.589 --> 01:32:03.959
我爱你。我保释了你。
I love you. I bailed you out.


1510
01:32:04.026 --> 01:32:06.328
别再这样对我了，乔伊。
Don't do this to me again, Joey.


1511
01:32:06.395 --> 01:32:08.431
我想杀了你。
I tried to kill you.


1512
01:32:08.497 --> 01:32:10.866
不。你救了我的命。
No. You saved my life.


1513
01:32:10.933 --> 01:32:12.267
什么?
What?


1514
01:32:12.334 --> 01:32:15.971
你给我的那些安眠药，减缓了我的出血速度。
Those sleeping pills you gave me, they slowed down my bleeding.


1515
01:32:16.038 --> 01:32:16.972
这是我活着的动力。
It's what kept me alive.


1516
01:32:17.039 --> 01:32:18.140
医生告诉我的。
The doctor told me.


1517
01:32:18.206 --> 01:32:21.143
狗娘养的，这么多年你一直在骗我。
Son of bitch, you cheated on me all these years.


1518
01:32:21.209 --> 01:32:22.611
我现在凭什么相信你?
Why should I trust you now?


1519
01:32:22.678 --> 01:32:25.280
因为我改变了。我焕然一新了。
Because I'm changed. I'm a new man.


1520
01:32:25.347 --> 01:32:27.115
为什么?为什么突然就来了?
Why? Why now all of a sudden?


1521
01:32:27.182 --> 01:32:29.317
因为你开枪打了我。
Because you shot me.


1522
01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:31.920
什么?
What?


1523
01:32:31.987 --> 01:32:41.987
罗西，当我在医院醒来发现发生了什么，我对自己说，天啊，这个女人，她爱死我了
Oh, Rosie, when I woke up in that hospital and I found out what happened, I said to myself, "My God, this woman, she loves me to death."


1524
01:32:42.531 --> 01:32:49.171
她太爱我了，她宁愿杀了我也不愿看到我和别的女人在一起。
She loves me so much she'd rather kill me than see me with another woman.


1525
01:32:49.237 --> 01:32:52.508
她已经准备好为我进监狱了，她太爱我了。
She's ready to go to prison for me, she loves me so much.


1526
01:32:52.575 --> 01:32:54.677
哦,宝贝。
Oh, baby.


1527
01:32:54.743 --> 01:33:04.743
这就是我所需要的，只是感受你的热情，知道你仍然像男人一样爱我……不像个丈夫，像个男人。
That's all I needed, just to feel your passion, to know you still love me like a man... not like a husband, like a man.


1528
01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:09.091
你是我的丈夫。
You are my husband.


1529
01:33:09.157 --> 01:33:10.493
你应该为此感到骄傲。
You should be proud of it.


1530
01:33:10.559 --> 01:33:13.295
我是你的妻子。我一直为此感到骄傲。
I'm your wife. I was always proud of it.


1531
01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:14.730
好吧,你是对的。
Okay, you're right.


1532
01:33:14.797 --> 01:33:16.632
我是你的丈夫。
I am your husband.


1533
01:33:16.699 --> 01:33:18.266
我也会感到骄傲的。
I'll be proud too.


1534
01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:21.303
我再也不会欺骗你了。从来没有。
I'll never cheat on you again. Never.


1535
01:33:21.369 --> 01:33:23.806
罗西，我爱你。
Oh, Rosie, I love you.


1536
01:33:23.872 --> 01:33:24.873
做我的妻子吧。
Be my wife again.


1537
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.742
哦,你疯了。
Oh, you're crazy.


1538
01:33:26.809 --> 01:33:28.376
你没有看见吗?
Don't you see?


1539
01:33:28.443 --> 01:33:29.645
这是我们的命运。
It's our destiny.


1540
01:33:29.712 --> 01:33:31.179
我们注定要在一起。
We're doomed to be together.


1541
01:33:31.246 --> 01:33:32.748
就像罗密欧与朱丽叶。
Like Romeo and Juliet.


1542
01:33:32.815 --> 01:33:35.050
我会永远对你忠诚。
And I'll always be faithful to you.


1543
01:33:35.117 --> 01:33:36.418
就像罗密欧与朱丽叶。
Like Romeo and Juliet.


1544
01:33:36.485 --> 01:33:38.386
无论什么。
Whatever.


1545
01:33:51.266 --> 01:33:53.268
你觉得乔伊能对她忠诚吗?
You think Joey can be faithful to her?


1546
01:33:53.335 --> 01:33:54.870
一切皆有可能。
Anything is possible.


1547
01:33:54.937 --> 01:33:56.839
他给了我一盒糖果。
He gave me a box of candy.


1548
01:33:58.974 --> 01:34:01.109
如果他不是呢?
What if he isn't?


1549
01:34:01.176 --> 01:34:03.245
我们再朝他开枪。
We shoot him again.


1550
01:34:06.014 --> 01:34:09.284
开玩笑的
Just kidding.
