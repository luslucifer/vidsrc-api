00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:44.620
<i>The sunset over Mount Huaguo
is more beautiful than any fairyland.</i>


2
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.799
<i>This is all that the monkey
remembers of Mount Huaguo.</i>


3
00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.423
<i>The monkey once heard a legend</i>

4
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.136
<i>that in the depths
of the Heavenly Kingdom</i>


5
00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.548
<i>the Destiny Astrolabe controls
the fate of all living things.</i>


6
00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.929
<i>However, the stone that NÃ¼wa
used to patch the sky bred a giant,</i>


7
00:02:05.054 --> 00:02:07.679
<i>who refused to accept his fate.</i>

8
00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.512
<i>The Heavenly Kingdom claims</i>

9
00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:12.262
<i>that any living thing that does not
submit to control is a demon.</i>


10
00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.430
<i>The giant became a devil.</i>

11
00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.055
<i>As the gods tried their utmost
to exterminate him,</i>


12
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.763
<i>the devil attacked
the Heavenly Kingdom.</i>


13
00:02:20.888 --> 00:02:23.513
<i>The heavens and the earth
were shocked at his fury.</i>


14
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.680
<i>But the giant was defeated
nonetheless.</i>


15
00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:31.721
<i>Fierce lightning tore
the giant's body to pieces.</i>


16
00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:34.263
<i>And the fragments of his body fell
and scattered across the earth.</i>


17
00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.263
<i>In the places where they fell,
all living things thrived,</i>


18
00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:40.013
<i>and Mount Huaguo was born.</i>

19
00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:43.513
<i>The heart of the stone
that patched the sky lived on</i>


20
00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:45.306
<i>and evolved into the monkey.</i>

21
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:50.222
<i>The monkey made Mount Huaguo
his home with the sunset as company.</i>


22
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.306
<i>But the Destiny Astrolabe found him.</i>

23
00:02:56.222 --> 00:03:00.431
<i>Plants are burnt,
creatures are frozen.</i>


24
00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:03.181
<i>Mount Huaguo passed out of existence.</i>

25
00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:06.431
<i>The monkey disappeared as
the earth was ripped asunder.</i>


26
00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:13.056
<i>The monkey was furious and vowed
that as long as he was still alive</i>


27
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:17.098
<i>he would destroy the Heavenly Kingdom
and wreak havoc there.</i>


28
00:03:17.223 --> 00:03:21.390
<i>But at that time
the sky was covered in darkness.</i>


29
00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:36.432
HEAVENLY KINGDOM

30
00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:52.766
My Lord.

31
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:55.433
Mount Huaguo was destroyed

32
00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.349
The Destiny Astrolabe
has run consistently.


33
00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:59.224
The heart of the stone
has disappeared.


34
00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.849
There is none left to challenge
the might of the Heavenly Kingdom.


35
00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:20.600
<i>Attention!</i>

36
00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:25.059
It is the 1,000-year changing of the guard
at the Destiny Council.


37
00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:29.600
The Academy of Destiny is responsible
for selecting succeeding immortals.


38
00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:33.850
You have all undergone rigorous
selection from various departments


39
00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:37.642
and are the wisest with the greatest
potential to ascend to immortality.


40
00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:41.893
You will be divided into two sects
in your spiritual journey here.


41
00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:43.768
The Heavenly Sect,

42
00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:48.268
those selected from
outstanding descendants of the gods,


43
00:04:48.393 --> 00:04:51.851
and the Earthly Sect,
the most hardworking pupils


44
00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:53.976
that conducted their spiritual journey
in the world of men.


45
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.768
Our Lady will award
the third class peaches,


46
00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:58.851
that the Queen Mother of the West
personally gave her,


47
00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:02.351
to the top disciples
of the Heavenly Sect.


48
00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:19.894
Azi?

49
00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.227
Azi!

50
00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:25.436
The ceremony is about to begin.
What are you doing sitting here?


51
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.186
I'm not doing anything,
just watching the sunset.


52
00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.811
Then I'll be going. Hurry up.

53
00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:08.187
Who's that?

54
00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.563
Stop!

55
00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:30.396
I've always watched others eat.
Now it's my turn to have a taste.


56
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:34.396
<i>I heard that these peaches
are really juicy.</i>


57
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.272
Prince Juling,
the peaches are coming.


58
00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:42.022
Should I go a bit harder?

59
00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:44.855
Hey! Where's she taking it?

60
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.189
Hurry, bring her here
and teach her a lesson!


61
00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:48.730
Come here!

62
00:06:49.647 --> 00:06:52.564
Put your peach down here.

63
00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.855
Put your peach here.

64
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.230
Sit!

65
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:58.689
Sit!

66
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.272
What are you doing? Come!

67
00:07:02.397 --> 00:07:05.022
- Get the assassin!
- I didn't do it on purpose.


68
00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:07.147
Catch her!

69
00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:12.440
- Are you here to assassinate me?
- I'm just here to deliver the peach.


70
00:07:15.273 --> 00:07:17.315
Is this the peach?

71
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.648
How dare you eat my peach?

72
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.606
Applause!

73
00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:26.440
I'm Juanlian.

74
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.273
Juling, show some respect.
You shouldn't hit women.


75
00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:37.232
I mustn't hit women?
I can also hit men!


76
00:07:48.774 --> 00:07:52.732
- You mustn't hit men!
- Great!


77
00:07:56.941 --> 00:07:59.066
Stop! No clapping!

78
00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.607
Go to hell!

79
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:07.067
I'll protect you.

80
00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:19.360
Great!

81
00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:33.277
I can't eat the peach?
Why didn't you say so earlier?


82
00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:35.570
And then you started beating them.

83
00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:39.570
If you're going to fight anyone,
fight me.


84
00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:47.111
Get him!
Do what he did to me back to him!


85
00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:50.236
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait up. Wait up.


86
00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:24.279
That's better.

87
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.197
I'm sorry.
Recently I've had a lot of earwax.


88
00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:03.739
- What is it?
- The disciples are fighting.


89
00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:07.156
My Lady, please go
to the side chamber and rest.


90
00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:09.864
Tianpeng.

91
00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:28.198
Do you know who I am?

92
00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:33.657
Listen up!

93
00:11:33.782 --> 00:11:38.157
For the next 10,000 years,
you will remember my name.


94
00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:39.532
My name is...

95
00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.574
It's you! You're the one that stole
the peach and got my friend in trouble.


96
00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:44.782
Think you're something special?
Think you can fight?


97
00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:46.157
What are you hitting me for?
I saved you, you silly witch.


98
00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:47.990
- Damn monkey!
- How do I look like a monkey?


99
00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:51.240
You look just like a monkey.
Damn monkey!


100
00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:53.907
An inferior little animal like you
isn't even qualified


101
00:11:54.032 --> 00:11:55.782
to serve me alongside Chalky.

102
00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:57.240
You...

103
00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:00.158
Who's Chalky?

104
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.283
Let me tell you.

105
00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:08.616
Listen up.
What are you shushing for?


106
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:11.283
Shush, my foot!
I haven't finished speaking.


107
00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:14.158
Chalky, let's go.

108
00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:16.200
Bye-bye.

109
00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:29.284
- My name is...
- Cut your crap.


110
00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.662
Stop!

111
00:14:02.912 --> 00:14:05.537
Get out of the way!

112
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.163
You're late.

113
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.538
Are you hurt?

114
00:14:28.663 --> 00:14:30.496
Of course not!

115
00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.246
And who are you?

116
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:36.996
I'm Erlang from Guankou
of the Kunlun Mountains.


117
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.080
Also known as Yang Jian.

118
00:16:57.876 --> 00:17:00.501
Do you know who I am?

119
00:17:02.168 --> 00:17:03.626
Listen up.

120
00:17:04.876 --> 00:17:09.460
For the next 10,000 years,
you will remember my name.


121
00:17:13.126 --> 00:17:15.751
My name is...

122
00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:18.293
Sun

123
00:17:18.418 --> 00:17:21.877
Wukong!

124
00:17:30.544 --> 00:17:32.086
I thought you'd never shut up.

125
00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:46.044
Don't think I'm afraid of you.
I'll beat you to death with this stick.


126
00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:49.627
I'll kill you today.
Today! I'll kill you for sure!


127
00:17:49.752 --> 00:17:51.712
What are you looking at?

128
00:17:55.128 --> 00:17:57.878
His name is Sun Wukong
and he's not from any of our sects.


129
00:17:58.003 --> 00:17:59.920
However, his power and magic

130
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.378
have broken all records for 100 years
in the Academy of Destiny.


131
00:18:02.503 --> 00:18:05.212
So we broke the rules
in taking him down.


132
00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:08.420
- But we never imagined...
- My Lady, I was wrong.


133
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:09.837
I was absent at the opening ceremony,
caused trouble in the great hall


134
00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:11.378
and broke academy rules.
It will not happen again.


135
00:18:11.503 --> 00:18:13.045
Just punish that damned monkey.

136
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.628
Erlang has just got back,
and I was the one that told him to do it.


137
00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:18.920
Just punish me.

138
00:18:19.045 --> 00:18:22.671
I sent Tianpeng to take care of things
but Erlang interfered,


139
00:18:22.796 --> 00:18:25.421
violating academy rules.

140
00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:38.463
I sent you on spiritual cultivation,

141
00:18:38.588 --> 00:18:42.963
but 100 years later,
you still act like this.


142
00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.713
You actually remember that we haven't
seen each other for a hundred years.


143
00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:50.922
Mother, I made this.
It can protect you.


144
00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:54.005
Take care of yourself.

145
00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.714
<i>Tianpeng,</i>

146
00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:14.005
<i>I will always remember you,
no matter how many years pass.</i>


147
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:36.548
Erlang.

148
00:19:36.673 --> 00:19:38.381
You're called Erlang, right?

149
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.215
Aren't you tired of keeping up
that morbid expression?


150
00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:45.006
Didn't you look mighty a minute ago?

151
00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:47.466
But now look at you.
You're locked up in here with me.


152
00:19:47.591 --> 00:19:50.091
The Heavenly Kingdom has rules.

153
00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:52.257
Fighting is a punishable offence.

154
00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:55.591
So two of you against me is
a rule of the Heavenly Kingdom.


155
00:19:55.716 --> 00:19:58.007
You still lost.

156
00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:00.924
Lost? I don't accept that.

157
00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:03.257
Let's go again. Come on.

158
00:20:03.382 --> 00:20:06.007
Let's do it again.

159
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:08.341
What? Don't you want to fight?

160
00:20:08.466 --> 00:20:12.341
Now I remember. Just now,
those jerks over there were laughing


161
00:20:12.466 --> 00:20:14.382
about how your mother
broke the divine law.


162
00:20:14.507 --> 00:20:17.758
She fell in love with a mortal
and is now trapped under Mount Tao.


163
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.675
Then she gave birth to you, a freak
that is neither human nor immortal.


164
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.508
Say that again.

165
00:20:22.633 --> 00:20:25.758
To put it simply, you are a mongrel.

166
00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:35.300
Our Lady.

167
00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:39.842
My Lady.

168
00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:43.383
Erlang, go back to the Destiny Council
and wait for me.


169
00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:47.843
What's going on? Why is he
allowed to go? What about me?


170
00:20:47.968 --> 00:20:49.968
Do you really think
no one can control you?


171
00:20:50.093 --> 00:20:52.301
There is nothing on earth
that can defeat me.


172
00:20:52.426 --> 00:20:56.676
So I came up here
to have some fun with you immortals.


173
00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:02.218
Is that a reward for me?

174
00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:07.676
This reward should not just
belong to me, but to all of us.


175
00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.926
That...

176
00:21:12.968 --> 00:21:14.468
A crown?

177
00:21:14.593 --> 00:21:16.927
Come. Give it here.

178
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.219
Wait.

179
00:21:24.344 --> 00:21:26.344
This is yours.

180
00:21:37.302 --> 00:21:39.010
That's it?

181
00:22:09.386 --> 00:22:11.678
That damned monkey deserved that.

182
00:22:11.803 --> 00:22:13.637
He brazenly destroyed the grand hall,
endangered the disciples


183
00:22:13.762 --> 00:22:15.262
and almost hurt me.

184
00:22:15.387 --> 00:22:17.554
And he got Erlang in trouble.

185
00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:19.429
My Lady, how about this?

186
00:22:19.554 --> 00:22:23.804
Give that golden lotus wand to me
and I'll discipline him for you,


187
00:22:23.929 --> 00:22:26.762
and make sure everyone is safe.

188
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:31.679
You can't even keep yourself disciplined.
How can you discipline others?


189
00:22:31.804 --> 00:22:34.429
Please give me this opportunity.

190
00:22:43.013 --> 00:22:45.638
Nothing can defeat him?

191
00:22:58.888 --> 00:23:00.430
<i>Monkey...</i>

192
00:23:02.472 --> 00:23:07.930
They destroyed Mount Huaguo and
wanted to eliminate your undying heart.


193
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:10.680
They said it was fate.

194
00:23:15.598 --> 00:23:20.223
Heart of the stone.
Yet I found you.


195
00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:26.306
In the beginning
you didn't know anything.


196
00:23:26.431 --> 00:23:30.181
To get rid of stubbornness,
you have to understand everything.


197
00:23:30.306 --> 00:23:33.514
You will be called Sun Wukong
from now on.


198
00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:38.681
While the heart of the stone lives on,

199
00:23:38.806 --> 00:23:41.099
the Heavenly Kingdom
will never let you be.


200
00:23:41.224 --> 00:23:45.432
I have sealed your power
inside the form of a human.


201
00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:48.890
I will teach you everything I can.

202
00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:53.682
Let me see what you can change
in this world.


203
00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:28.516
Do you know why you cannot
open your heavenly eye?


204
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:31.183
I sent you to
roam the earth for years,

205
00:24:31.308 --> 00:24:33.600
and although you can differentiate
the heavens from the earth,


206
00:24:33.725 --> 00:24:37.766
you have nothing but your mother
and Azi in your heart.


207
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:41.101
But as an immortal, you should embrace
all living creatures on the earth.


208
00:24:41.226 --> 00:24:44.059
You must dismiss
your personal emotions,


209
00:24:44.184 --> 00:24:47.517
before your heavenly eye can awaken
and bestow you with unlimited power.


210
00:24:47.642 --> 00:24:51.559
Only then, can you become
a real immortal.


211
00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.101
You're awake.

212
00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:02.476
What are you doing?

213
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:05.559
Why have you done this to me?
What is it?


214
00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:09.435
I cut it for you. 
Do you like it?

215
00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:16.102
Why? Why?

216
00:25:16.768 --> 00:25:20.643
- What do you think?
- Why did you cut my hair?


217
00:25:20.768 --> 00:25:22.310
You!

218
00:25:22.435 --> 00:25:24.602
It suits your golden band.

219
00:25:24.727 --> 00:25:28.435
Where's my master's scarf?
Give my scarf back.


220
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.352
Your scarf was filthy.
I had it washed for you.


221
00:25:31.477 --> 00:25:33.352
Look, look at yourself now.

222
00:25:33.477 --> 00:25:36.018
How can I take you anywhere
if you look like that?


223
00:25:36.143 --> 00:25:38.769
Look how clean Chalky is.

224
00:25:40.811 --> 00:25:42.853
I don't want to be your servant.

225
00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:45.603
Do you really think
that this can control me?


226
00:25:46.103 --> 00:25:48.103
You underestimated me, Sun...

227
00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:49.478
Wu...

228
00:25:50.644 --> 00:25:52.853
Don't waste your energy. This is
a holy article of the Heavenly Kingdom.


229
00:25:52.978 --> 00:25:54.561
Even I can't take it off.

230
00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:57.728
Right now, I'm the only one
that can recite the spell.


231
00:25:57.853 --> 00:26:02.353
OK.
I can accept you as my servant.


232
00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:06.728
Call me My Lady.

233
00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:09.895
Say the spell then. I dare you.

234
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.937
You don't know what you're dealing with.
I am from hell!


235
00:26:13.062 --> 00:26:14.937
My hands are stained with blood.

236
00:26:15.062 --> 00:26:19.187
No rare beasts, the old, weak,
women or children escape my wrath.


237
00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:24.229
- My Lady, I apologize.
- Sit.


238
00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:25.770
Sit!

239
00:26:30.687 --> 00:26:33.312
You're a good boy.

240
00:26:34.312 --> 00:26:35.687
Smile.

241
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.105
Bloody witch!
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?


242
00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:57.438
What's that noise?

243
00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.564
Stop!

244
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:36.023
Yesterday I thought
you were a righteous hero.


245
00:27:36.148 --> 00:27:38.690
Who would have thought
that you would try such filth today?


246
00:27:38.815 --> 00:27:40.648
Who told you to come in?

247
00:27:40.773 --> 00:27:43.148
- I didn't come in, I came down.
- Get back up there.


248
00:27:43.273 --> 00:27:44.898
It's easy getting down,
but getting back up is not so easy.


249
00:27:45.023 --> 00:27:48.190
- Get out!
- Pull me back up!


250
00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:51.232
You think you can fool me like that?
I won't be fooled.


251
00:27:51.357 --> 00:27:53.065
Women are so naive.

252
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.982
Get lost! Get lost!

253
00:28:01.648 --> 00:28:04.274
This is the kitchen with the best scenery
in the Heavenly Kingdom.


254
00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.191
You can stay here.

255
00:28:07.316 --> 00:28:08.983
Then I'll be...

256
00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:27.191
Why? Why did you destroy
so many beautiful places?


257
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:30.691
I don't understand.
I don't accept it.


258
00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:33.066
My Lady, it was all my fault.

259
00:28:33.192 --> 00:28:35.692
Don't punish Azi.

260
00:28:35.817 --> 00:28:39.025
Erlang, your mother has been
imprisoned under Mount Tao.


261
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.400
You are neither human nor immortal
and come from humble origins.


262
00:28:41.525 --> 00:28:43.817
I brought you here from
the Kunlun Mountains and promoted you


263
00:28:43.942 --> 00:28:46.192
because you had never made mistakes.

264
00:28:46.317 --> 00:28:48.067
You have really let me down.

265
00:28:48.192 --> 00:28:53.442
Erlang, I'm sorry
for getting you into trouble.


266
00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:56.025
I want to become a great immortal.

267
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.942
I'm going to save everyone.

268
00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:02.485
I want to be a great immortal, too.
I will always protect you.


269
00:29:09.693 --> 00:29:12.276
Erlang, I'm sorry for getting you
into trouble again.


270
00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:13.610
It's nothing.

271
00:29:13.735 --> 00:29:15.776
You've been down in the world
of humans for so long. Did you have fun?


272
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.151
There's nothing fun down there.

273
00:29:18.818 --> 00:29:23.193
You told me that you like flowers.
This is for you.


274
00:29:25.318 --> 00:29:27.276
What is it?

275
00:29:27.401 --> 00:29:31.611
Seeds of the most beautiful flowers
that I saw on my journeys.


276
00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:35.444
If you like, I can make the Heavenly
Kingdom look like the human world,


277
00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:37.861
full of flowers.

278
00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:40.611
I'd like that.

279
00:29:42.652 --> 00:29:44.986
- How has it been since I left?
- It's fine.


280
00:29:45.111 --> 00:29:47.111
- Look how fat it is.
- Too fine!


281
00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:49.194
It's so fat that it can't even put
on a suit of armour.


282
00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:52.194
- Xiaotian, let's go.
- I told you, its name's Chalky.


283
00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:54.611
- But he's black.
- He's white.


284
00:29:54.736 --> 00:29:57.444
- He's black.
- It's not me. Ask it yourself.


285
00:29:57.569 --> 00:29:59.152
Chalky, are you white or black?

286
00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:04.153
I have followed your commands
and I am monitoring Sun Wukong.


287
00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:06.903
He has some purpose for being here.

288
00:30:07.487 --> 00:30:10.112
Just give the order.

289
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.695
Wait for me to confirm something first.

290
00:30:26.778 --> 00:30:29.403
You say you want to become invincible.

291
00:30:31.613 --> 00:30:34.196
What's so great about being invincible?

292
00:30:34.321 --> 00:30:36.946
At least I can control my own destiny.

293
00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:46.779
All destiny in this world is controlled
by the Destiny Astrolabe.


294
00:30:46.904 --> 00:30:49.738
With it, the Heavenly Kingdom
can balance the three realms


295
00:30:49.863 --> 00:30:51.821
and govern all souls.

296
00:30:51.946 --> 00:30:54.654
No one can stop it.

297
00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:58.404
I don't care. I will go to
the Heavenly Kingdom and destroy it!


298
00:31:04.364 --> 00:31:06.989
<i>I will destroy the Destiny Astrolabe.</i>

299
00:31:15.072 --> 00:31:19.447
The Destiny Council is located
at the highest of the thirty-six heavens.


300
00:31:20.364 --> 00:31:22.947
It commands the three realms,
the six destinies, the five elements


301
00:31:23.072 --> 00:31:25.489
and the forces of yin and yang.

302
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.240
Behind this gate is the enchanted bridge
that leads to the Destiny Astrolabe,


303
00:31:42.698 --> 00:31:45.323
as well as the boundary that separates the
human world from the Heavenly Kingdom.


304
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.073
If you fall off, the power of enchantment
will suck all of your immortal powers


305
00:31:53.365 --> 00:31:56.740
and you will vanish and die
without a trace.


306
00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:15.366
This is the control room.

307
00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:19.199
The heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon,
the wind, thunder, rain, lightning,


308
00:32:19.324 --> 00:32:21.407
the changes in the four seasons,

309
00:32:21.532 --> 00:32:26.616
all celestial events that
mortals witness are operated from here.


310
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.950
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.


311
00:32:34.158 --> 00:32:35.908
Don't make trouble
in the Heavenly Kingdom.


312
00:32:36.033 --> 00:32:38.117
And what if I do?

313
00:32:38.242 --> 00:32:41.283
- You...
- What will you do?


314
00:32:49.783 --> 00:32:52.408
This is the Destiny Astrolabe,

315
00:32:53.867 --> 00:32:56.701
the core area in the Destiny Council.

316
00:32:56.826 --> 00:32:59.076
Greetings, My Lady.

317
00:32:59.201 --> 00:33:01.826
Greetings, My Lady!

318
00:33:02.534 --> 00:33:04.576
The first thing you will learn
in today's lesson


319
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:08.701
is an understanding of the balance
between the heavens and the earth.


320
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:13.909
This is Mount Huaguo.

321
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:16.659
The devil once reincarnated
and hid himself here.


322
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:24.659
300 years ago,

323
00:33:24.784 --> 00:33:27.119
we complied with the heavens' orders
and wiped out the devil.


324
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.827
The fires of heaven raged for months,

325
00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:38.285
and ice covered the mountain for years,

326
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.577
thoroughly cleansing Mount Huaguo

327
00:33:40.702 --> 00:33:43.327
and finally restoring a balance
to the heavens and the earth.


328
00:33:49.202 --> 00:33:52.994
Right now, this land should
have been restored to life,


329
00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:54.953
but because of years of disasters

330
00:33:55.078 --> 00:33:57.036
caused by the evil spirit
that permeates the land there,


331
00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:59.245
life is nothing but despair.

332
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.120
Possibly, the devil still lives.

333
00:34:04.536 --> 00:34:09.578
By the mercy of the gods, it is time again
to cleanse this land of evil.


334
00:34:12.745 --> 00:34:14.578
Rubbish!

335
00:34:20.703 --> 00:34:23.495
That used to be a beautiful land.

336
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.246
It is like this now
because of your cruelty.


337
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:29.496
Why don't you give them
a chance to be reborn?


338
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.537
The ones that sin
should be punished.


339
00:34:31.662 --> 00:34:35.996
But they shouldn't be killed.
I refuse any orders from heaven like that.


340
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:41.829
Answer me, if it was your own child,
would you kill it?


341
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:46.454
If it's destiny, I would do so
without a second thought.


342
00:34:48.996 --> 00:34:52.037
Finally, I realize
why you treat me like this.


343
00:35:06.455 --> 00:35:09.205
Damn monkey!
Wait for me.


344
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.372
Have you finished? You...

345
00:35:11.497 --> 00:35:13.497
You are her daughter.

346
00:35:13.622 --> 00:35:16.455
- What are you doing?
- Give it back!


347
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.372
Stay away from me.

348
00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:24.914
Just as I thought...

349
00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:29.581
The heart of the stone
was not destroyed.


350
00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:33.664
The devil lives on.

351
00:35:37.623 --> 00:35:40.081
We can't let him disturb
the Heavenly Kingdom.


352
00:35:40.206 --> 00:35:42.373
Find an opportunity to kill him.

353
00:35:42.498 --> 00:35:45.123
Bring me the heart of the stone.

354
00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:50.498
Azi?

355
00:35:50.623 --> 00:35:52.040
Azi?

356
00:35:59.665 --> 00:36:04.832
You invite me here
and then say nothing? Why?


357
00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:45.208
The enchanted bridge is a forbidden area
of the Heavenly Kingdom.


358
00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:47.333
You stole the entrance warrant.

359
00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:51.459
You are here
not to become an immortal,


360
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:53.167
but for some other scheme.

361
00:36:53.292 --> 00:36:56.167
Enough. Enough. Enough!

362
00:36:56.292 --> 00:36:58.501
What's so good
about being an immortal?


363
00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:01.251
Do you really think
that I can't defeat you?


364
00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:44.877
Damn monkey,
I want a word with you.


365
00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:58.086
If you want me, just say so!
Why did you have to knock me out?


366
00:37:58.211 --> 00:37:59.669
Don't do it again.

367
00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:03.169
What are you talking about?
Where's that damned monkey?


368
00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.419
You're leaving?

369
00:38:15.169 --> 00:38:17.795
Don't waste time.

370
00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:35.379
Erlang!

371
00:38:39.254 --> 00:38:41.254
- Stay away!
- Be careful!


372
00:39:40.672 --> 00:39:42.214
My meteorite...

373
00:39:48.257 --> 00:39:52.090
<i>They destroyed Mount Huaguo and
wanted to eliminate your undying heart.</i>


374
00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:54.132
<i>They said it was fate.</i>

375
00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:59.298
<i>The ice covered the mountain for years,
thoroughly cleansing Mount Huaguo.</i>


376
00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:03.465
<i>I don't care! I will go to
the Heavenly Kingdom and destroy it!</i>


377
00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.423
<i>Remember why you are here.</i>

378
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:15.760
Azi.

379
00:41:18.635 --> 00:41:21.260
We're not dead?

380
00:41:23.635 --> 00:41:26.260
What just happened?

381
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.593
Where is this?

382
00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:33.510
This is Mount Huaguo.

383
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:40.176
He is the reincarnation
of the devil 300 years ago.


384
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:43.636
His heart of the stone blocked
the enchanted storm.


385
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:45.594
He brought us here.

386
00:41:49.969 --> 00:41:52.844
I won't let you go back alive.

387
00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:56.386
If I can't go back,
don't think about going back either.


388
00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:00.511
- Then let's see.
- Come on!


389
00:42:00.636 --> 00:42:02.386
Come on.

390
00:42:56.596 --> 00:42:59.429
Stop it! Without any powers,
what exactly are you doing?


391
00:42:59.554 --> 00:43:01.804
I'm the boss down here.
Frozen saltpetre.


392
00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:04.679
It's a physical phenomenon.
It doesn't need any magic.


393
00:43:04.804 --> 00:43:06.304
I invented it.

394
00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:09.054
Stop it. Don't fight.

395
00:43:18.597 --> 00:43:20.847
- What is it?
- Keep it down.


396
00:43:23.389 --> 00:43:24.722
Kill it!

397
00:43:24.847 --> 00:43:27.472
What can we do
without any powers, Azi?


398
00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:31.222
Break in!

399
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:33.389
Give me that.

400
00:43:33.514 --> 00:43:35.014
Azi! Azi!

401
00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:37.972
Stay back!

402
00:43:46.556 --> 00:43:48.723
- Stay away, demon!
- We're not demons.


403
00:43:48.848 --> 00:43:52.765
Rubbish. Anything that falls
from the sky is a demon.


404
00:43:55.056 --> 00:43:58.640
- We're not! We're not!
- Mortal men, don't forget your manners.


405
00:43:58.765 --> 00:44:00.431
This doesn't look good.

406
00:44:00.556 --> 00:44:02.598
Azi, get out of here.
I don't want you getting hurt.


407
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:07.098
I'll show you my ultimate move.
A thousand fists!


408
00:44:16.266 --> 00:44:17.974
It seems there are bogus demons, too.

409
00:44:18.099 --> 00:44:20.432
- Get him.
- Kill him!


410
00:44:26.224 --> 00:44:28.932
You want to kill me, murder me.

411
00:44:30.432 --> 00:44:33.224
It's taken me 300 years.

412
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:36.016
You'll never succeed.

413
00:44:36.141 --> 00:44:38.642
Even if it takes me another 3,000 years,
or 30,000 years,


414
00:44:38.767 --> 00:44:41.225
I will never accept defeat!

415
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.058
The cloud demon is coming!
The cloud demon is coming!


416
00:44:50.558 --> 00:44:54.558
The cloud demon!
The cloud demon is coming!


417
00:45:08.934 --> 00:45:11.559
Azi!

418
00:45:22.434 --> 00:45:24.143
Wait!

419
00:45:35.018 --> 00:45:37.019
- Hide!
- Get inside.


420
00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:48.102
Azi! Don't worry.

421
00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:55.602
Village Chief! My child!

422
00:45:56.227 --> 00:45:58.560
- Village Chief!
- Your child?


423
00:45:58.685 --> 00:46:01.060
- My child's not here!
- Who's seen her child?


424
00:46:04.685 --> 00:46:06.770
The child is over there!

425
00:46:18.228 --> 00:46:23.561
- Don't go out there.
- There's someone out there.


426
00:46:23.686 --> 00:46:26.311
Don't go.

427
00:46:28.895 --> 00:46:30.561
Don't worry.

428
00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.729
<i>Ayue.</i>

429
00:46:35.854 --> 00:46:40.646
<i>The day we met,
the stars lit up in my life.</i>


430
00:46:41.937 --> 00:46:44.396
<i>The Heavenly Kingdom
is banishing you to the human world.</i>


431
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:47.021
But I won't let you face
this punishment alone.


432
00:46:48.396 --> 00:46:50.062
I'll go with you.

433
00:47:09.897 --> 00:47:12.022
<i>You are the guardian of the stars.</i>

434
00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:14.272
You have to stay here,

435
00:47:14.397 --> 00:47:18.980
to protect the world and the stars.

436
00:47:19.105 --> 00:47:21.730
The only thing I
want to protect is you.

437
00:47:25.688 --> 00:47:27.438
Run!

438
00:47:30.813 --> 00:47:32.814
Give him here.

439
00:47:32.939 --> 00:47:36.856
You can't go out there.
You'll die if you go out there.


440
00:47:47.648 --> 00:47:51.814
<i>Do you remember the meteorite
I gave you?</i>


441
00:47:51.939 --> 00:47:56.148
As long as we have the meteorite,
no matter where I go,


442
00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.898
I will always remember you.

443
00:48:14.899 --> 00:48:16.607
Damn monkey!

444
00:48:31.983 --> 00:48:34.483
Azi!
My magic weapon can stop it.


445
00:48:34.608 --> 00:48:37.233
Fire it. Now. Now!

446
00:49:16.776 --> 00:49:18.276
Ayue...

447
00:49:28.234 --> 00:49:30.735
My Lady, the enchanted bridge
has been destroyed


448
00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.610
and Azi has fallen off it.

449
00:49:32.735 --> 00:49:36.693
The enchanted storm wreaked havoc
upon the Instrument of Destiny.


450
00:49:36.818 --> 00:49:40.735
As soon as we get it working again,
we will do everything we can to find her.


451
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.235
Also, the Lord is looking
into this matter.


452
00:49:59.944 --> 00:50:02.361
Give it a rest.
You don't even have your powers.


453
00:50:02.486 --> 00:50:05.111
You can't get out of that rope.

454
00:50:07.319 --> 00:50:10.653
- Let me out.
- How can I? I'm tied up myself.


455
00:50:13.653 --> 00:50:17.653
- You're awake.
- You damned witch, let me go!


456
00:50:21.944 --> 00:50:25.486
Sit!
This is the last of the villagers' grain.


457
00:50:25.611 --> 00:50:27.278
They offer it to thank us.

458
00:50:27.403 --> 00:50:31.904
They believe that we are real immortals
and that we are here to save them.


459
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.070
The cloud demon absorbed
all their water supply.


460
00:50:34.195 --> 00:50:36.154
They can't even grow any grain.

461
00:50:36.279 --> 00:50:38.237
Either way, we cannot go back.

462
00:50:38.362 --> 00:50:40.570
And the cloud demon will appear again.

463
00:50:40.695 --> 00:50:44.820
I've decided that we are going
to stay here and save them.


464
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.237
Save them? Why?

465
00:50:50.362 --> 00:50:53.112
Right. Why?

466
00:50:53.237 --> 00:50:55.570
What do you mean?

467
00:50:55.695 --> 00:50:58.280
They can't be saved because
you immortals decide everything.


468
00:50:58.405 --> 00:51:00.488
If you want to save them, you have
to destroy the Destiny Astrolabe.


469
00:51:00.613 --> 00:51:02.571
That's the only way
they can control their own fate!


470
00:51:02.696 --> 00:51:06.113
Fate is predestined.
No one can change their fate.


471
00:51:06.238 --> 00:51:07.571
Erlang.

472
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:11.196
You're mad.

473
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:14.446
- You want to be punished again?
- Who do you think you're fooling?


474
00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:17.488
We don't even have any powers.
And your weapon is useless!


475
00:51:17.613 --> 00:51:21.196
- Out of the way.
- Where are you going?


476
00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.905
Out of the way. 
Out of the way.

477
00:51:29.822 --> 00:51:31.614
What are you looking at?

478
00:51:31.739 --> 00:51:34.114
<i>One's destiny cannot be denied.</i>

479
00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:37.822
<i>Azi, 300 years ago,</i>

480
00:51:38.906 --> 00:51:40.864
<i>this was Mount Huaguo.</i>

481
00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:45.031
<i>Look at the place.
What exactly can we do?</i>


482
00:51:45.156 --> 00:51:47.822
<i>Mother said that this place
is beyond hope.</i>


483
00:51:47.947 --> 00:51:50.572
<i>But I've seen hope here.</i>

484
00:51:51.656 --> 00:51:54.489
<i>I believe that the
Lord will see it, too.</i>

485
00:51:54.614 --> 00:51:57.990
Erlang, you told me

486
00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:00.407
that no matter where I was,
if I wanted it,


487
00:52:00.532 --> 00:52:03.157
you would plant
an ocean of flowers for me.


488
00:52:18.032 --> 00:52:20.657
I want those flowers to bloom here.

489
00:53:00.867 --> 00:53:03.200
- You're awake.
- Ayue!


490
00:53:05.867 --> 00:53:08.492
I've finally found you.

491
00:53:11.242 --> 00:53:13.450
Immortal, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to offend you.


492
00:53:13.575 --> 00:53:17.867
You saved our village,
but now we have nothing.


493
00:53:17.992 --> 00:53:20.617
That was all the water we had.

494
00:53:21.242 --> 00:53:22.409
I...

495
00:53:23.493 --> 00:53:27.160
Your armour, I mended it.

496
00:53:27.285 --> 00:53:29.910
I hope you don't mind.

497
00:53:33.701 --> 00:53:35.243
This stone...

498
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.826
I've had this stone since I was young.

499
00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:41.410
Please do not take it from me.

500
00:53:41.535 --> 00:53:43.118
I'm sorry.

501
00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:59.369
- Was there any water?
- There isn't any.


502
00:53:59.494 --> 00:54:02.744
- There's nothing.
- I told you before.


503
00:54:02.869 --> 00:54:05.202
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you everywhere.


504
00:54:05.327 --> 00:54:08.244
I've been looking for you everywhere!
I couldn't find you anywhere!


505
00:54:08.369 --> 00:54:10.786
- That's an immortal.
- Lady! No!


506
00:54:10.911 --> 00:54:13.494
That's Fengshou. He's my son.

507
00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:17.661
- Stop talking nonsense. Fengshou's dead.
- He's not dead.


508
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.537
This is Mount Huaguo, right?
I really like it here.


509
00:54:30.703 --> 00:54:33.328
Don't tell me that
this is Mount Huaguo again.


510
00:54:33.828 --> 00:54:36.453
There isn't even anywhere here
to watch the sunset.


511
00:54:40.078 --> 00:54:42.703
The Heavenly Kingdom
took away your sunsets,


512
00:54:43.162 --> 00:54:45.787
so we'll go and take them back.

513
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:52.371
I'll take care of this for you.

514
00:55:04.163 --> 00:55:06.829
Everyone, come!
Come over here. Come over here.


515
00:55:06.954 --> 00:55:10.246
We've decided to stay and help you
be rid of that demon.


516
00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:12.204
Great!

517
00:55:12.329 --> 00:55:14.038
We've looked into things thoroughly.

518
00:55:14.163 --> 00:55:16.079
The cloud demon absorbed water
from the land,


519
00:55:16.204 --> 00:55:19.329
but now it has no more water and is
consuming moisture from people's bodies.


520
00:55:19.454 --> 00:55:21.747
All we want to know
is how to get rid of it.


521
00:55:21.872 --> 00:55:23.955
Right. Right!

522
00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.830
Let me have a look. I'll have a look.
I'll have a look.


523
00:55:26.955 --> 00:55:28.664
Quiet!

524
00:55:31.622 --> 00:55:35.164
We cannot waste any time
waiting for it to appear again.


525
00:55:35.289 --> 00:55:38.539
We have to draw it out
and catch it.


526
00:55:38.664 --> 00:55:41.497
- How can we catch it?
- The best defence is offence.


527
00:55:41.622 --> 00:55:45.830
We will... catch the cloud.

528
00:55:45.955 --> 00:55:49.289
Nonsense.
I have a completely different idea.


529
00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:54.290
The way to get the upper hand over it
is to force it out and corner it.


530
00:55:54.415 --> 00:55:55.706
Then surround it and attack.

531
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:57.706
How is that any different
from my idea?


532
00:55:57.831 --> 00:55:59.248
I've got a plan. You haven't.

533
00:55:59.373 --> 00:56:00.956
I haven't even told you my plan.
How do you know I don't have one?


534
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:02.665
- Then tell us.
- You wouldn't even understand.


535
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.331
- Try me.
- Why should I tell you?


536
00:56:04.456 --> 00:56:05.415
- Whatever.
- I'll tell you.


537
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.706
- I don't want to hear it.
- I'm going to tell you anyway.


538
00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:11.748
Enough!
Be quiet if you don't know what it is.


539
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:14.165
The cloud demon was an immortal cloud
from the Heavenly Kingdom.


540
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.748
It wandered down here and absorbed
the resentment in Mount Huaguo,


541
00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.415
turning it into a demon.

542
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.416
It has taken the thing
most important away from me.


543
00:56:20.541 --> 00:56:24.499
And I want it back.
I can't do this alone.


544
00:56:24.999 --> 00:56:28.957
We believe that the immortals
can help us get rid of the demon.


545
00:56:31.082 --> 00:56:33.541
The cloud demon is up in the sky
and we have to trick it into coming down


546
00:56:33.666 --> 00:56:35.374
by creating a sunset scene.

547
00:56:35.499 --> 00:56:36.874
Either we draw it down
or we force it down.


548
00:56:36.999 --> 00:56:40.582
We will trap it here,
besiege it and then catch it.


549
00:56:40.707 --> 00:56:43.666
Well, creating a sunset
isn't exactly feasible.


550
00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:45.082
Why not?

551
00:56:45.207 --> 00:56:47.416
I've thought it through.
There's nothing here.


552
00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:51.083
All we have is cloth. So we'll use
cloth to create a sunset scene.


553
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:53.083
- Come on!
- OK.


554
00:56:58.375 --> 00:57:00.458
Even if we can draw it down,
then what?


555
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.625
Your weapon is pretty effective
against the cloud demon.


556
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.167
But the cloud demon is so big.
We can make a super-sized cannon.


557
00:57:05.292 --> 00:57:09.417
Make a crossbow for me. Improve
its consistency, accuracy and range.


558
00:57:09.542 --> 00:57:13.958
- Most importantly, it needs to be light.
- It needs to be big! Huge! Huge!


559
00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:18.834
- I'll put it here.
- OK.


560
00:57:18.959 --> 00:57:21.584
Come on. Let's try it.

561
00:57:22.918 --> 00:57:24.668
This won't do.

562
00:57:24.793 --> 00:57:26.918
Erlang, it's done. 
Is it big enough?

563
00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:30.126
What do you think?
Looks good, right?


564
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:34.334
- It's not big enough.
- It's not light enough.


565
00:57:34.459 --> 00:57:37.084
I want a big one!

566
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.918
How can we catch the cloud
with this cage?


567
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.419
So that's it.

568
00:57:48.544 --> 00:57:51.169
I'm sorry.

569
00:57:57.002 --> 00:57:59.544
Attack the cloud! 
Catch the cloud!

570
00:57:59.669 --> 00:58:02.627
Attack the cloud! 
Catch the cloud!

571
00:58:05.877 --> 00:58:10.210
Wukong, look at this. Look!
Big enough? Big enough?


572
00:58:12.169 --> 00:58:14.794
It's light enough.

573
00:58:16.503 --> 00:58:19.128
What do you think? 
Isn't it good?

574
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.211
Let's work together.

575
00:58:22.336 --> 00:58:24.253
- Let's make it rain.
- Let's make it rain.


576
00:58:24.378 --> 00:58:27.003
Prepare to attack the cloud.

577
00:58:27.753 --> 00:58:33.420
If this saltpetre shell fires,
we'll be able to freeze the cloud demon.


578
00:58:35.961 --> 00:58:39.711
Great! Great!

579
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:45.754
Careful.

580
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:54.962
Next, we'll arrange
all the cloth just here.


581
00:58:55.087 --> 00:58:58.587
I think it should go... just here.

582
00:58:58.712 --> 00:59:00.629
- Just here?
- Right.


583
00:59:00.754 --> 00:59:03.379
No. Here.

584
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:11.254
Wherever you want it.

585
00:59:16.547 --> 00:59:19.547
Come over here. Come here!

586
00:59:19.672 --> 00:59:22.047
Come here!

587
00:59:22.172 --> 00:59:24.547
I've got some delicious food.

588
00:59:24.672 --> 00:59:30.672
Everyone in the village said
you were dead.


589
00:59:31.463 --> 00:59:34.088
I told them you weren't.

590
00:59:34.213 --> 00:59:38.297
This is a sweet potato.
Eat it. Eat.


591
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.006
Son.

592
00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:48.631
Son!

593
00:59:58.714 --> 01:00:00.173
Come.

594
01:00:03.464 --> 01:00:06.173
Don't open your eyes.

595
01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:07.839
One.

596
01:00:07.964 --> 01:00:09.339
Two.

597
01:00:09.464 --> 01:00:12.089
Three.

598
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:19.465
It's beautiful.

599
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.965
There are no stars in the sky here,
so from now on,


600
01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:24.715
you'll be able to see the stars
whenever you open your eyes.


601
01:01:18.134 --> 01:01:19.467
<i>If you like,</i>

602
01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:22.009
<i>I can make the Heavenly Kingdom
look like the human world,</i>


603
01:01:22.134 --> 01:01:24.092
<i>full of flowers.</i>

604
01:01:24.217 --> 01:01:26.842
<i>I'd like that.</i>

605
01:01:33.676 --> 01:01:36.717
Heave! Heave!

606
01:01:36.842 --> 01:01:37.967
Heave!

607
01:01:38.092 --> 01:01:40.093
Heave!

608
01:01:40.843 --> 01:01:42.302
Heave!

609
01:01:42.427 --> 01:01:43.510
Great!

610
01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.178
It's coming!

611
01:02:11.303 --> 01:02:13.928
It's coming!

612
01:02:16.594 --> 01:02:17.928
It's dark!

613
01:02:18.053 --> 01:02:20.678
Illuminate the sunset!

614
01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:25.094
It fell down!

615
01:02:27.553 --> 01:02:30.261
Cloud attack force, come with me.
Quick.


616
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:35.303
I'll take the children into hiding.
Come. Come with me.


617
01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:38.053
Go.

618
01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:46.304
I'll go and get the saltpetre shells.

619
01:02:57.054 --> 01:02:59.679
Sun Wukong, hang in there.

620
01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:33.680
I'll help you.

621
01:03:33.805 --> 01:03:36.013
Hurry up, everyone. Hurry up!

622
01:03:36.138 --> 01:03:37.597
Hurry.

623
01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:51.264
Pull!

624
01:04:01.306 --> 01:04:03.889
Come over here,
and get it standing up.


625
01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:06.640
One, two, three!

626
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.932
Quick.

627
01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:16.682
Give me. Quick.

628
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.932
Aim at the cloud on the right.
Quick!


629
01:04:24.723 --> 01:04:29.015
Illuminate the sunset.
Leave this to us.


630
01:04:54.183 --> 01:04:55.974
It's coming. It's coming.

631
01:04:57.183 --> 01:05:00.058
The cloud is too high.
Lift it higher.


632
01:05:00.183 --> 01:05:01.683
- Erlang!
- Go!


633
01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:17.600
Hurry!

634
01:05:57.851 --> 01:05:59.810
We caught it!

635
01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:01.435
We caught it! We caught it!

636
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.186
We caught it!

637
01:06:27.519 --> 01:06:28.811
It's raining!

638
01:06:28.936 --> 01:06:31.561
It's raining!

639
01:06:52.395 --> 01:06:55.978
My Lord. This is all my fault.

640
01:06:56.103 --> 01:06:58.353
This was all an accident.

641
01:06:58.478 --> 01:07:00.895
The enchanted storm has subdued.

642
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.813
The Instrument of Destiny Astrolabe
is operating normally.


643
01:07:02.938 --> 01:07:05.563
The balance between heaven and earth
has not been affected.


644
01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:17.979
This time, we worked together
with these immortals and made it rain.


645
01:07:18.104 --> 01:07:20.521
Everyone must remember their names.

646
01:07:24.979 --> 01:07:26.646
Look.

647
01:07:26.771 --> 01:07:28.771
It's the same as my stone.

648
01:07:28.896 --> 01:07:32.314
This is the other half.
Originally they were one meteorite.


649
01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:34.272
Do you remember?

650
01:07:34.397 --> 01:07:36.105
You gave this to me.

651
01:07:40.814 --> 01:07:45.939
You told me that
as long as we had this meteorite,


652
01:07:46.064 --> 01:07:47.939
you would remember me.

653
01:07:58.855 --> 01:08:01.481
I'm sorry.

654
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:12.690
It seems that in 200 years
everything can be forgotten.


655
01:08:24.065 --> 01:08:28.856
Is the past...
really that important?


656
01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:36.857
These last few days with you...

657
01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:44.149
...have been the happiest of my life.

658
01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:50.607
This time you can
put it on for me.

659
01:08:52.066 --> 01:08:53.607
OK?

660
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:01.942
Sit down. Sit. Sit down.

661
01:09:02.067 --> 01:09:04.150
What do you have for me today?

662
01:09:04.275 --> 01:09:07.817
It's your favourite, sweet potato.

663
01:09:09.608 --> 01:09:12.233
It's sweet.

664
01:09:21.942 --> 01:09:24.942
I know that you're not Fengshou.

665
01:09:25.858 --> 01:09:28.484
Fengshou is never coming back.

666
01:09:30.026 --> 01:09:32.318
After you return to the heavens,

667
01:09:32.443 --> 01:09:34.984
if you see him,

668
01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:39.193
can you tell him
not to worry for me?

669
01:09:39.318 --> 01:09:44.818
He should be a great immortal.

670
01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:58.027
To be honest, I envy Fengshou.

671
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:06.152
All these years,
I've never seen my mother.


672
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:14.319
I want to know what she is doing.

673
01:10:19.194 --> 01:10:21.819
I hope one day I can meet her.

674
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.903
Don't worry.

675
01:10:28.028 --> 01:10:30.653
Fengshou will look after you.

676
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.945
OK.

677
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.736
I don't know how
the cloud demon fell for it.


678
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.486
This really doesn't look much
like a sunset.


679
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.153
But I like it.

680
01:10:50.528 --> 01:10:53.028
You know this golden band
has no power over you,


681
01:10:53.153 --> 01:10:55.779
so why are you still wearing it?

682
01:11:03.404 --> 01:11:06.029
I'm used to it.

683
01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.447
What's this?

684
01:11:27.572 --> 01:11:29.113
A monkey.

685
01:11:29.238 --> 01:11:31.238
That's a dog.

686
01:11:31.363 --> 01:11:34.280
It looks nothing like a monkey.
Monkeys don't look like that!


687
01:11:34.405 --> 01:11:37.030
Give it back.

688
01:12:10.406 --> 01:12:12.364
I'm back.

689
01:12:14.156 --> 01:12:16.781
Although it's not like
what it used to be,


690
01:12:18.198 --> 01:12:22.781
I can feel that
this is my Mount Huaguo.


691
01:12:48.824 --> 01:12:51.865
Let me tell you. Do you know why
Sun Wukong, Erlang,


692
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:53.783
and Tianpeng look up to me
so much?


693
01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:56.991
Because I have a special move
called a thousand fists.


694
01:12:57.116 --> 01:13:01.075
If everyone gives me five copper coins,
I'll teach it to you.


695
01:13:01.783 --> 01:13:03.116
Do you believe me?

696
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.116
I'll only charge you three copper coins.

697
01:13:06.241 --> 01:13:08.866
OK, free.

698
01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:38.534
Go!

699
01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:52.118
Sir, take things easy.

700
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:02.952
Tianpeng.

701
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:34.286
You don't have to take it
that seriously.


702
01:14:36.578 --> 01:14:39.369
If you want something,

703
01:14:39.494 --> 01:14:42.119
then come and get it.

704
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.954
Run!

705
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.204
Where are we going?

706
01:15:02.329 --> 01:15:04.204
She is coming
with the celestial warriors.


707
01:15:04.329 --> 01:15:07.245
If we don't go now, everyone will die.

708
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.704
So we have to go. Go!

709
01:15:10.829 --> 01:15:13.454
What about the villagers?

710
01:15:15.954 --> 01:15:17.995
Stay inside and don't come out.

711
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:21.538
Run as far as you can.

712
01:15:21.663 --> 01:15:25.830
We managed to defeat the cloud demon,
what do we have to fear?


713
01:15:30.455 --> 01:15:31.996
Fight!

714
01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:38.913
Do you still believe
in my thousand fists?


715
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:21.750
Immortal...

716
01:17:24.959 --> 01:17:27.584
How can this have happened?

717
01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.376
Juanlian.

718
01:17:49.835 --> 01:17:54.376
See if that kid... is still alive.

719
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:55.918
Kid?

720
01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:18.836
- The kid is fine.
- Then that's all that matters.


721
01:18:22.877 --> 01:18:27.461
Was my thousand fists...
really impressive?


722
01:18:28.711 --> 01:18:30.336
Really.

723
01:18:38.502 --> 01:18:39.919
Juanlian...

724
01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:43.087
Juanlian.

725
01:18:50.545 --> 01:18:52.295
Juanlian.

726
01:19:08.462 --> 01:19:09.878
Ayue?

727
01:19:12.338 --> 01:19:13.754
Ayue?

728
01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:20.129
You have to protect the villagers.

729
01:19:21.213 --> 01:19:23.838
And the stars you made for me.

730
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:32.254
I just want to be with you.

731
01:22:35.844 --> 01:22:37.720
As an immortal,

732
01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:40.803
you should feel no desire
or sense of self.


733
01:22:41.553 --> 01:22:45.511
You must forget your pain
and perceive life as it is.


734
01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:49.803
The day you fell down here,

735
01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:53.053
they should have died
in this decrepit temple.


736
01:22:53.178 --> 01:22:55.595
You gave them false hope,

737
01:22:56.928 --> 01:23:00.678
and you brought them nothing
but more pain in death.


738
01:23:00.803 --> 01:23:05.804
We're not here to kill people,
but to put an end to the chaos.


739
01:23:07.762 --> 01:23:11.429
Did you really think I didn't know
what you were up to?


740
01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:15.179
I made you experience all of this

741
01:23:16.096 --> 01:23:20.637
to teach you that
you can't change anything.


742
01:24:11.764 --> 01:24:13.348
Azi...

743
01:24:16.056 --> 01:24:18.223
We were wrong.

744
01:24:18.348 --> 01:24:22.598
Without permission from the heavens,
those seeds will never flower.


745
01:24:26.306 --> 01:24:28.931
While we were in the village,
we were mortals.


746
01:24:30.056 --> 01:24:34.182
He wasn't a demon
and you weren't an immortal.


747
01:24:36.765 --> 01:24:39.390
But now you are
in the Heavenly Kingdom


748
01:24:40.307 --> 01:24:42.932
and should do as immortals do.

749
01:24:46.349 --> 01:24:49.432
He is locked in a cell at the bottom
of the Destiny Purgatory.


750
01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:55.807
<i>He has endured every possible pain,
but still won't die.</i>


751
01:24:58.557 --> 01:25:01.182
<i>Because he is waiting for you.</i>

752
01:25:02.015 --> 01:25:05.725
<i>Go and beseech him to let go.</i>

753
01:25:20.308 --> 01:25:21.975
You came.

754
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:27.975
I knew you would come.

755
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.226
You kept yourself from dying
purely to tell me that?


756
01:25:37.767 --> 01:25:43.017
I want to say that I love the ocean
in Mount Huaguo.


757
01:25:43.142 --> 01:25:44.851
Sun Wukong...

758
01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.934
Seeing you like this,

759
01:25:51.892 --> 01:25:54.517
I realize you are nothing
but a handful of dirt.


760
01:25:55.476 --> 01:25:57.142
I hate you.

761
01:25:59.267 --> 01:26:00.684
I despise you.

762
01:26:09.435 --> 01:26:11.227
You've lost.

763
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:14.935
You've lost everything.

764
01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:33.353
Mount Huaguo is gone.

765
01:26:34.894 --> 01:26:38.936
The sky there is covered in darkness.
There is no sunset.


766
01:26:49.686 --> 01:26:51.519
So this is it.

767
01:26:54.186 --> 01:26:56.061
This is it.

768
01:28:14.939 --> 01:28:17.147
Rest in peace.

769
01:28:17.272 --> 01:28:20.897
I will complete your mission for you.

770
01:28:23.481 --> 01:28:27.148
<i>Wait for me.
I will be with you soon.</i>


771
01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:50.065
There has never been an immortal

772
01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:52.815
that could get
this undying heart of the stone.


773
01:28:53.523 --> 01:28:55.648
You managed it.

774
01:28:55.773 --> 01:29:01.774
Erlang, this test has finally taught you
to let go of your earthly ties.


775
01:29:02.816 --> 01:29:06.649
Now, I will help you open
your heavenly eye.


776
01:29:37.942 --> 01:29:40.775
After so much hardship,

777
01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.609
you find yourself here again.

778
01:29:43.734 --> 01:29:46.025
You wanted to seek revenge
for Mount Huaguo


779
01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:48.317
and defeat the immortals.

780
01:29:50.525 --> 01:29:53.150
Did you achieve it?

781
01:29:56.151 --> 01:29:58.318
I could not.

782
01:29:58.443 --> 01:30:02.985
Mount Huaguo is gone.
The heart of the stone is gone.


783
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:05.693
Everything is predestined.

784
01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.318
I lost.

785
01:30:08.443 --> 01:30:13.568
Feeling powerless is just the start
of your awakening.


786
01:30:15.401 --> 01:30:18.735
<i>Do you really think
there was no way left for you?</i>


787
01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.443
<i>Do you accept your fate?</i>

788
01:30:22.401 --> 01:30:25.402
<i>Or will you continue to fight
for what's in your heart?</i>


789
01:30:34.652 --> 01:30:38.069
No matter how powerful
the heart of the stone is,


790
01:30:38.194 --> 01:30:41.819
it is still a part of the stone
that NÃ¼wa used to patch the sky.


791
01:30:41.944 --> 01:30:45.611
Using it to topple its power
will never work.


792
01:30:47.194 --> 01:30:49.819
You still haven't found
the weapon you need.


793
01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:53.237
<i>Think about the life you have spent,</i>

794
01:30:56.403 --> 01:30:58.403
<i>who you have met,</i>

795
01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:02.612
<i>and everything that
you refuse to let go of.</i>


796
01:31:04.278 --> 01:31:06.403
<i>Now you have a power</i>

797
01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:09.653
<i>that the Heavenly Kingdom
has never witnessed.</i>


798
01:32:54.241 --> 01:32:56.491
GREAT SAGE, EQUAL OF HEAVEN

799
01:32:58.449 --> 01:33:00.282
We are demons.

800
01:33:00.407 --> 01:33:03.032
Take me to the heavens.

801
01:33:46.117 --> 01:33:50.159
I am entrusted by the Lord
with protecting the Destiny Council.


802
01:33:50.284 --> 01:33:53.659
Who dares to cause trouble here?
Show yourself!


803
01:34:49.245 --> 01:34:52.245
Who are you?
Who exactly are you?


804
01:34:53.161 --> 01:34:56.078
For the rest of your lives,

805
01:34:56.203 --> 01:34:58.828
you will remember my name.

806
01:35:04.495 --> 01:35:08.703
My name is...
the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven.


807
01:35:10.328 --> 01:35:14.078
Sun... Wukong!

808
01:35:22.371 --> 01:35:24.496
I really can't tell the difference
between any of you.


809
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:27.412
Either way,
anyone wearing a mask


810
01:35:29.246 --> 01:35:32.246
shouldn't even think
about getting out of here alive.


811
01:37:16.791 --> 01:37:19.125
It seems you finally understand.

812
01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:29.125
All of them died.

813
01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:33.250
You call it Fate.
All must comply.


814
01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:37.875
It turns out that you are the only one
who can control your destiny.


815
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.791
You have so much blood
on your hands


816
01:37:39.916 --> 01:37:43.042
in the name of balancing
the heavens and the earth.


817
01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:47.834
But all you ever wanted was
Sun Wukong's heart of the stone.


818
01:37:47.959 --> 01:37:52.042
You wanted it to increase your power
and continue your rule.


819
01:37:55.209 --> 01:37:59.501
Now you want to turn Erlang into someone
like you. I will not let that happen!


820
01:38:24.668 --> 01:38:26.168
You came.

821
01:39:13.879 --> 01:39:15.212
Let go!

822
01:39:18.837 --> 01:39:20.962
I told you to let go.

823
01:39:22.087 --> 01:39:25.462
Why do you always
have to go against me?


824
01:39:25.587 --> 01:39:29.629
I told you that I could kill you

825
01:39:29.754 --> 01:39:32.504
any time I wanted to!

826
01:40:06.088 --> 01:40:08.714
You know that you can change nothing.

827
01:40:09.964 --> 01:40:12.506
Why are you all here
seeking your deaths?


828
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:16.381
I'm not like you.
I can't spend my life alone.


829
01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:53.298
How come you came back
looking like a dog?


830
01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:57.382
This is what I've always looked like.

831
01:40:58.965 --> 01:41:00.715
I'm ugly, right?

832
01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.715
I like you like this.

833
01:41:04.423 --> 01:41:06.423
You look so cute.

834
01:41:14.174 --> 01:41:16.799
In the future, 
I'll be your servant.

835
01:41:22.841 --> 01:41:26.466
In the future... you will be free.

836
01:41:28.049 --> 01:41:33.008
No one will force you to do anything.
You can do whatever you like.


837
01:41:34.883 --> 01:41:38.467
Then I will take you to Mount Huaguo
to watch the sunset.


838
01:42:08.093 --> 01:42:10.010
What's that noise?

839
01:43:29.095 --> 01:43:32.470
<i>The Heavenly Kingdom
took away your sunsets,</i>


840
01:43:32.595 --> 01:43:35.054
<i>so we'll go and take them back.</i>

841
01:43:37.013 --> 01:43:40.554
<i>I can feel that
this is my Mount Huaguo.</i>


842
01:44:09.722 --> 01:44:14.180
<i>Is the past... really that important?</i>

843
01:44:16.514 --> 01:44:20.972
<i>These last few days with you
have been the happiest of my life.</i>


844
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:42.271
Yang Jian is already an immortal
and his heavenly eye has opened.


845
01:47:42.396 --> 01:47:44.437
He has no desires,
and achieves formlessness.


846
01:47:44.562 --> 01:47:46.812
All he can see
are the heavens and earth.


847
01:47:46.937 --> 01:47:49.687
You cannot defeat the power
of the heavens and the earth.


848
01:47:49.812 --> 01:47:53.646
The heavens want to suppress me,
so I'll cleave the heavens!


849
01:47:53.771 --> 01:47:57.147
The earth wants to stop me,
so I'll crush the earth!


850
01:49:53.026 --> 01:49:58.901
You finally understand
your true power.


851
01:50:49.527 --> 01:50:52.069
Why can't you still let go?

852
01:50:52.194 --> 01:50:54.819
Why can't you understand your destiny?

853
01:50:58.153 --> 01:50:59.861
Stop lying.

854
01:51:00.819 --> 01:51:05.069
This is your destiny. Not mine.

855
01:51:26.904 --> 01:51:30.070
The Heavenly Kingdom is in chaos.
The immortals are incompetent.


856
01:51:30.195 --> 01:51:34.445
Redefining order between the heavens
and the earth is my true destiny.


857
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:39.195
Your vain obsessions
are nothing but betrayals.


858
01:51:59.571 --> 01:52:02.196
I know the wrath of the heavens.

859
01:52:02.738 --> 01:52:07.571
But do you know
the heavens may tremble?


860
01:54:38.243 --> 01:54:39.993
Sun Wukong...

861
01:54:41.951 --> 01:54:45.036
Even by defeating
the Instrument of Destiny,


862
01:54:45.161 --> 01:54:47.536
there is nothing you can change.

863
01:54:49.869 --> 01:54:51.494
I came...

864
01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:54.994
...I fought...

865
01:54:56.244 --> 01:54:58.286
...and I care not
about the consequences.


866
01:55:00.411 --> 01:55:03.036
Today, Azi saved you.

867
01:55:05.494 --> 01:55:08.119
But from now on,

868
01:55:12.452 --> 01:55:15.995
I am a god
and you are a devil.

869
01:55:17.078 --> 01:55:20.120
I will always seek your destruction.

870
01:55:30.745 --> 01:55:33.370
The next time we meet,

871
01:55:36.203 --> 01:55:38.828
don't hold anything back.

872
01:55:56.288 --> 01:55:58.746
<i>The heavenly scriptures
record the event like this:</i>


873
01:55:58.871 --> 01:56:02.121
<i>Her Lady and the devil revolted
in the Heavenly Kingdom,</i>


874
01:56:02.246 --> 01:56:04.746
<i>and they were decried as demons.</i>

875
01:56:04.871 --> 01:56:06.913
<i>Yang Jian helped to remove the evil,</i>

876
01:56:07.038 --> 01:56:09.538
<i>and was promoted to the First General
of the Heavenly Southern Gate</i>


877
01:56:09.663 --> 01:56:12.079
<i>and entrusted with cleansing
the three realms.</i>


878
01:56:13.330 --> 01:56:15.789
<i>The monkey returned
to Mount Huaguo</i>


879
01:56:15.914 --> 01:56:18.080
<i>with the desire to see
the purple sunsets there.</i>


880
01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:20.997
<i>He called upon all living creatures
that refused to accept their fate</i>


881
01:56:21.122 --> 01:56:24.539
<i>to engage in a hundred years' war
with the Heavenly Kingdom.</i>


882
01:56:24.664 --> 01:56:27.122
<i>Who is the monkey?</i>

883
01:56:27.247 --> 01:56:28.777
<i>It's me.</i>

884
01:56:28.891 --> 01:56:33.365
<i>I am... Sun Wukong!</i>

885
01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:36.632
I WANT THE SKY
NO LONGER TO BLIND MY EYES


886
01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:40.010
I WANT THE EARTH
NO LONGER TO BURY MY HEART


887
01:56:40.136 --> 01:56:42.638
I WANT ALL THE LIVING BEINGS
TO UNDERSTAND MY MIND


888
01:56:43.181 --> 01:56:45.975
I WANT ALL THE GODS

889
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.687
TO DISAPPEAR
