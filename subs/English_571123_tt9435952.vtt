1
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.268
- I remember it was Sunday
morning after Thanksgiving.


2
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.185
I was 11 years old,

3
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:25.143
and I had spent the night

4
00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:28.019
at my best friend Tracy's
house.


5
00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.810
The clock radio went off
and woke me up,


6
00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:33.477
and I heard a news report say

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.226
my mom's body was found
off the coast of Catalina.


8
00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:41.852
The next thing I knew,
my stepdad's driver


9
00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:45.185
was there with our nanny,
Willie Mae.


10
00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:47.852
They had come to pick me up
and take me home.


11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.019
It had rained,
and the streets were wet,


12
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.351
and I was asking,
"Is Mommy okay?"


13
00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:57.393
But they were
just comforting me,


14
00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.894
and they weren't really
telling me what happened.


15
00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.810
When I got home,
I got into my mom's bed


16
00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.727
and tried to comfort myself.

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.393
I said, "Maybe she just has
a broken leg


18
00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.060
or something like that."

19
00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:16.143
Then my stepdad came back.

20
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.769
I went down the steps,
and I could tell,


21
00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:22.727
just when I looked
at his face,


22
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.602
that something awful
had happened.


23
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:30.560
The day my mom died,
my entire world was shattered,


24
00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:33.226
and our family
has never been the same.


25
00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:38.769
Since then, there's been
so much speculation


26
00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:41.935
and focus on how she died

27
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.727
that it's overshadowed
her life's work


28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.643
and who she was
as a person.


29
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.935
I'm Natasha Gregson Wagner,

30
00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.101
and my mom was Natalie Wood.

31
00:02:45.727 --> 00:02:47.602
- Hello, Natalie.
- Oh, hello again.


32
00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:49.268
Please sit down.
- Thank you.


33
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:50.602
How's the food?

34
00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:52.143
- Best location food
I ever ate.


35
00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.185
- Well, I must say,
you certainly seem


36
00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:54.310
to thrive on it.

37
00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:55.769
- Well, I was brought up on it.

38
00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:56.810
I've been eating lunch
on the set


39
00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:58.143
since I was four years old.

40
00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.310
- That's correct.
Natalie's a movie veteran.


41
00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:02.977
Been in pictures since 1941.
Is that correct?


42
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.310
- That's right.

43
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.935
My original real name

44
00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.310
was Natalia Nikolaevna
Zakharenko.


45
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:11.518
Zakharenko was always
being mispronounced.


46
00:03:11.602 --> 00:03:13.643
It was very difficult,
so my parents


47
00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.143
changed their name to Gurdin,

48
00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:16.810
and then that
got mispronounced a lot,


49
00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:18.602
so when I was five years old

50
00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:20.685
and William Goetz
put me into my first film,


51
00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.019
he that that Gurdin
was not a good name,


52
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.185
and at this point,
I was being called Natasha,


53
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.935
which is really a nickname
for Natalia,


54
00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.518
so he chose Natalie,
and then he chose Wood


55
00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:33.060
in honor of his friend
Sam Wood, the director.


56
00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:34.560
So that's how I got named.

57
00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:37.685
Oh, daisies
on your coffeepot!


58
00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.560
They're my favorite flower.

59
00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.852
- With Natalie Wood,

60
00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:43.101
one of the most fascinating
things about her is,


61
00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.852
generations of people
watched her grow up,


62
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:47.894
and so it was congruent

63
00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.685
with what was happening
with their own development.


64
00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.060
- No, Mom.
We haven't gone too far.


65
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:54.977
- When you're an adolescent,
you're a very different person


66
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.393
than you were when you were
five years old,


67
00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:00.185
and she certainly was that
but on steroids,


68
00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:02.143
'cause she was a movie star.

69
00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:03.143
- Wish me luck!

70
00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.894
I'm gonna make a noise
in the world!


71
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.727
- The business she was in
is a tough business,


72
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.393
and to survive
in that business,


73
00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:12.226
you had to have
a tough side to you,


74
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.935
and so I think she had
to develop that.


75
00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.560
But it wasn't comfortable.

76
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.852
What she really wanted to do
was to laugh and have fun


77
00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:20.226
and just be a regular person.

78
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.560
But mainly,
she had a big heart,


79
00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:24.019
and that showed up
in her work.


80
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.769
- You can't pinpoint what it is
that draws you to a character.


81
00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:29.852
You just suddenly say,
"I know her.


82
00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.019
I know that I can make her
be real."


83
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:35.226
- People knew she was smart
and incredibly well-organized,


84
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.019
and in a town
where women were


85
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.435
not always respected,

86
00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:43.060
not in their work
and not socially,


87
00:04:43.143 --> 00:04:44.518
she was an exception.

88
00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:46.727
She knew how it should be lit,

89
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.268
she knew how the sound
should be,


90
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:50.602
she knew how she should look,

91
00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:52.810
and she sure knew how to give
a great performance.


92
00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:54.351
- I know this may come
as a great big shock


93
00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:55.518
to the both of you,

94
00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:57.435
but underneath
all this hair and skin


95
00:04:57.518 --> 00:04:58.727
is a human girl

96
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.393
with all the regular things
going for me,


97
00:05:00.477 --> 00:05:01.602
and believe it or not,

98
00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:02.977
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life


99
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.435
married to a man
who's doing me a big favor!


100
00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:07.769
Primarily, I'm an actress,
and I think that at the point


101
00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:10.143
when you're a star,

102
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.393
mainly, I was thinking
of the work,


103
00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:15.769
not of the stardom
that follows it.


104
00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:18.060
I've enjoyed the part
where you act,


105
00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:19.727
where the red light goes on
and the camera rolls


106
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.310
and you really can do
your work,


107
00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:25.602
and in the film business,
there are so many other things


108
00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:27.852
that enter
into making it possible


109
00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:28.935
for those moments

110
00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:31.101
where you just are able
to do your craft


111
00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.435
without the interference
of a lot of other things.


112
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.727
- I always knew
that she was an actor,


113
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.435
but, you know,
around the house,


114
00:05:43.518 --> 00:05:45.977
my mom didn't wear
a lot of makeup,


115
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.310
and she was very casual,

116
00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:49.935
so I would look at her
and think,


117
00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.852
"What is--what's the big deal
about you, lady?"


118
00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.477
But then she and my stepdad
would get dressed up,


119
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.727
and they would go out
to dinner or something,


120
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.643
and she was amazing-looking.

121
00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:02.310
But we weren't raised
by someone


122
00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:05.185
who seemed like a movie star
at all.


123
00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:07.143
All she just seemed
was sort of larger than life


124
00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:08.810
but not because
she was famous,


125
00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:11.351
more because she was just her.

126
00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.019
- I was seven
when she passed away,


127
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.560
and I feel like my memories
of her


128
00:06:18.643 --> 00:06:20.685
are just ever-evolving.

129
00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:23.727
You know, there's
her beautiful face


130
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.393
and her voice
and her hands


131
00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:27.518
and all those things
that I remember.


132
00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:30.518
But when I try to think
of my mom now,


133
00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:32.643
it's so hard;
like, I will literally


134
00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:35.019
come across a picture,
and I'll just look at it,


135
00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.185
and I'll look at it
a little bit more, thinking,


136
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.351
"Is that really my mom?

137
00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:41.852
How is it that she's my mom?"

138
00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.060
I just have
this famous mother,


139
00:06:44.143 --> 00:06:46.560
and she's like
this mythology character.


140
00:06:46.643 --> 00:06:48.060
I--you know.

141
00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:50.560
I hope one day,
I'll get to a place


142
00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:54.894
where I can really access
the true feeling


143
00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:58.727
that this was my mother,
that I came from her


144
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.435
and that she was mine

145
00:07:01.518 --> 00:07:02.560
for a short time, you know?

146
00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:04.185
Like, I feel like

147
00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:08.602
it's just been very hard
to hold on to that.


148
00:07:11.643 --> 00:07:12.935
- I have two fathers.

149
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:15.518
My biological father
is Richard Gregson.


150
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.685
I call him Daddy Gregson.

151
00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:19.435
My stepfather
is Robert Wagner,


152
00:07:19.518 --> 00:07:21.226
who everyone calls RJ,

153
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.351
and I call him
Daddy Wagner.


154
00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:25.727
My mom was the one
that started calling them


155
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.351
Daddy Gregson
and Daddy Wagner


156
00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:30.935
to clarify who was who
in case people got confused.


157
00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:33.935
And then it's just
nicknames that have stuck.


158
00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.101
From the age of two,
I was primarily raised


159
00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:37.769
by my Daddy Wagner,

160
00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:39.101
and in all that time,

161
00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:41.226
he treated me
like his own blood.


162
00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:46.101
So, Dad,
I just want to say


163
00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:50.435
that I'm really excited
to talk to you about my mom...


164
00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:51.894
- Yes, I am too.

165
00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.810
- And everything
we've been through,


166
00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:56.101
the highs and the lows,

167
00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.060
how we've always stayed

168
00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:00.852
connected
through all of it.


169
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:02.769
- I don't think there's a day

170
00:08:02.852 --> 00:08:05.393
that has ever gone by
in my life that


171
00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:06.935
there hasn't been a moment

172
00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.935
that I haven't thought
about Natalie


173
00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:10.769
and how much
she meant to me


174
00:08:10.852 --> 00:08:12.935
in my heart
and in my soul.


175
00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:14.643
We started so young.

176
00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.435
To see her evolve
over the years


177
00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:18.935
into the woman that she was

178
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.351
was very special.

179
00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:23.810
- How did you two meet?
I want to hear both versions.


180
00:08:23.894 --> 00:08:25.852
- Well, actually,
when I was ten years old


181
00:08:25.935 --> 00:08:27.310
and RJ was about 18,
I guess,


182
00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:28.685
when you were first
under contract,


183
00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:31.477
I remember walking down
the hallway with my mother,


184
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.101
and I saw him,
and I said to my mother,


185
00:08:35.185 --> 00:08:38.935
"When I grow up,
I wish that I could marry him."


186
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.351
- Did you really?
- I really did.


187
00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:42.310
- Did you really know
that she...


188
00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:44.019
- Well, I didn't know it then.

189
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:45.477
It sure could've saved me
a lot of trouble,


190
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.477
I'll tell you.

191
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:50.310
- Could I ask for your
version of when you met?


192
00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:51.810
- When I came
into Natalie's life,


193
00:08:51.894 --> 00:08:53.894
I was sort of
a Happy Jack Squirrel kid,


194
00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:57.852
you know, with nothing
on my mind much but my hair


195
00:08:57.935 --> 00:09:00.351
and...

196
00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:02.185
She sort of resisted me
a bit, actually,


197
00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:03.685
at the beginning, because--
- I did?


198
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:04.810
- I was--yeah, well,
I was so different


199
00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:07.060
than all the rest of the--
- I don't remember that.


200
00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:08.685
- Well, yes, you did,
and then I finally started


201
00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:10.060
taking you--I remember
I took you out on--


202
00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:12.351
- On my 18th birthday, mm-hmm.
- On your 18th birthday.


203
00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:14.185
I took her out
on her birthday,


204
00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:17.477
July 20, 1956.

205
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.185
I had done a picture

206
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:21.393
with Spencer Tracy
called "The Mountain,"


207
00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:24.351
and we went to the premiere,
and that sort of started it.


208
00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:26.560
- Everybody knew
about Robert Wagner,


209
00:09:26.643 --> 00:09:29.185
and my dad
had introduced me to RJ


210
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:30.560
when I was maybe nine

211
00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:32.560
when he did "Prince Valiant,"

212
00:09:32.643 --> 00:09:34.977
which was, at the time,
my favorite movie,


213
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.727
and there he was,
Prince Valiant.


214
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.268
There was
nobody handsomer.


215
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:41.226
And he was so kind to me.

216
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.101
- On December 6, 1957,
I made a reservation


217
00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:46.685
at a restaurant
in Beverly Hills


218
00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:48.560
called Romanoff's.

219
00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:50.560
Man, I got Natalie down there,

220
00:09:50.643 --> 00:09:52.560
and I opened a bottle
of champagne.


221
00:09:52.643 --> 00:09:54.226
- We had some champagne,

222
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.894
and I suddenly looked
in my glass,


223
00:09:56.977 --> 00:09:59.393
and there was a ring in it,

224
00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:01.268
and I took the ring out
and looked,


225
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.310
and he said, "Look, guys,"
and, "My God, what is this?"


226
00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:06.101
Then he said,
"Look on the inside,"


227
00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:08.560
and it said, "Marry me."

228
00:10:54.852 --> 00:10:58.435
- We got married
in Scottsdale, Arizona,


229
00:10:58.518 --> 00:11:01.143
and I got
a private railroad car.


230
00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:06.351
After the ceremony,
we went to the private car,


231
00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:08.935
and a big train came by
and picked us up,


232
00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.143
and off we went to Chicago.

233
00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:13.101
It was pretty exciting.

234
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:20.977
- Maybe we should stay too.

235
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.518
- Well, I think
you ought to go.


236
00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:24.185
I really think you ought to.

237
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:25.810
Maybe she'll be better
by the morning.


238
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.310
Here.

239
00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:29.310
- Will you come back
to the apartment?


240
00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:31.477
- Yeah, yeah.
It's 695 Park Avenue.


241
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.310
Yeah, I'll come back.

242
00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.810
- I loved working
with RJ and Natalie.


243
00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:36.935
There was something about her

244
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:38.685
that was
incredibly ingratiating.


245
00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:41.852
She made you feel important,
not her.


246
00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:43.894
Something that's one
of the tricks of life


247
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:45.518
and success

248
00:11:45.602 --> 00:11:47.852
is to make other people
feel important


249
00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:50.019
when they're around you,
not because you are


250
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:51.185
an important person.

251
00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:52.977
- While here,
still enjoying the plaudits


252
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.518
for his
"In Love and War" role,


253
00:11:54.602 --> 00:11:55.685
is Robert Wagner

254
00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:57.185
with his lovely wife,
Natalie Wood.


255
00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:00.602
- The studios were always
anxious to get publicity,


256
00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:01.977
and at that time,

257
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.310
the movie magazines
were the thing--


258
00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:06.560
"Photoplay," "Modern Screen"--

259
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.769
and Natalie and I
were one of the hot things


260
00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:09.852
for the magazines,

261
00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:11.518
so they were very much
involved


262
00:12:11.602 --> 00:12:12.852
in our relationship.

263
00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:16.019
- Nat and RJ
were both major stars,


264
00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:19.351
and I didn't feel like one
was outshining the other.


265
00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:22.185
There's a sort of royalty
to that business,


266
00:12:22.268 --> 00:12:25.518
and RJ and Nat
were that royalty.


267
00:12:30.643 --> 00:12:33.727
- So why don't we start
by you telling me


268
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.185
how you and my mom met?

269
00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:37.351
- Oh, okay.

270
00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:39.685
Let's see.
How did we meet?


271
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:43.560
Well, I met your mother
and Daddy Wagner


272
00:12:43.643 --> 00:12:46.268
the same day,
the same moment,


273
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:50.518
because I was working
for the director Elia Kazan,


274
00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:52.727
and I was
a production assistant


275
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.685
on "Splendor in the Grass."

276
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:56.894
There, I had to go
and get your mother


277
00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:58.143
every morning.

278
00:12:58.226 --> 00:13:00.685
Therefore,
we talked an awful lot,


279
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:03.602
and it was clear to me

280
00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:07.310
that there was trouble
in their marriage.


281
00:13:07.393 --> 00:13:08.977
- Mm.

282
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.185
- I discovered that my mom
had written an article


283
00:13:12.268 --> 00:13:14.602
for "Ladies' Home Journal"
in 1966


284
00:13:14.685 --> 00:13:16.101
that was never published.

285
00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:17.101
It was called

286
00:13:17.185 --> 00:13:19.602
"Public Property,
Private Person."


287
00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.435
It was amazing
to read this article.


288
00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:24.727
I found out so many things
about my mom's life


289
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:25.852
that I didn't know,

290
00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:27.894
especially during
a really challenging time


291
00:13:27.977 --> 00:13:29.977
for her.

292
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.477
- "After two years
of marriage,


293
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.435
"things began to change.

294
00:13:34.518 --> 00:13:36.602
"We were aware
that we had problems,


295
00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:39.477
"but we tried to avoid
the real conflicts.


296
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.435
"We maintained a superficially
happy relationship


297
00:13:42.518 --> 00:13:45.060
"and hoped that by pretending
there was nothing wrong,


298
00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:47.019
"the problems would go away.

299
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:49.810
"How do you separate
reality from illusion


300
00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:53.477
"when you have been trapped
in make-believe all your life?


301
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.977
"Marriage requires patience
and work,


302
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.143
"as well as the capacity
to accept another human being,


303
00:13:59.226 --> 00:14:01.477
"flaws and all,
without cloaking him


304
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.268
in a smothering mantle
of perfection."


305
00:14:05.852 --> 00:14:09.185
- With the pressure of being
this wonderful couple


306
00:14:09.268 --> 00:14:12.685
and the marriage starting
to have difficulties in it,


307
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.310
I could feel it unraveling,
and so could she,


308
00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:16.643
and that time,

309
00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:19.769
her career really started
to catch on fire.


310
00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:21.351
It was like striking a match.

311
00:14:21.435 --> 00:14:24.143
And when she did "Splendor"
with Kazan,


312
00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:27.019
I mean, this was
a dream come true for her.


313
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.935
- "Though nothing
can bring back the hour


314
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.143
"of splendor in the grass,

315
00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:34.602
"glory in the flower,

316
00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.185
"we will grieve not,

317
00:14:37.268 --> 00:14:41.393
"rather find the strength

318
00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:45.351
in what remains behind."

319
00:14:45.435 --> 00:14:47.435
- And on that picture,
she knew


320
00:14:47.518 --> 00:14:50.685
that she was not
Kazan's first choice,


321
00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:52.393
and she was out to prove

322
00:14:52.477 --> 00:14:55.518
that she was
a serious actress.


323
00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:57.643
- Miss Metcalf,

324
00:14:57.727 --> 00:14:59.310
may I please be e--

325
00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:05.060
The opportunity
to work with Kazan


326
00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:06.643
was just fantastic,

327
00:15:06.727 --> 00:15:09.185
but it was emotionally
a very demanding role,


328
00:15:09.268 --> 00:15:11.226
and it-
-I don't know.

329
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.685
It had quite an effect
on my life, I think.


330
00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:17.727
- "As RJ and I struggled
to make our marriage work,


331
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.268
"the problems
continued to pile up.


332
00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:22.769
"After finishing work
on 'Splendor in the Grass,'


333
00:15:22.852 --> 00:15:25.101
"I went directly
into 'West Side Story'


334
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:28.602
"for another solid
and rigorous eight months.


335
00:15:28.685 --> 00:15:30.935
"The rest of the cast
had been rehearsing together


336
00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:33.101
"for a month
while I finished 'Splendor.'


337
00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:35.602
"Now I had to cram
four weeks of rehearsals


338
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.101
"into weekends.

339
00:15:37.185 --> 00:15:38.351
"I was worn out,

340
00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:40.435
"and I didn't have time
to be the kind of wife


341
00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:42.143
"I wanted to be.

342
00:15:42.226 --> 00:15:43.852
"During this hectic period,

343
00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:45.393
"RJ went through an ordeal

344
00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:47.393
"that all performers,
including myself,


345
00:15:47.477 --> 00:15:48.560
"have to face.

346
00:15:48.643 --> 00:15:50.894
"His career hit
a momentary lull.


347
00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:53.101
"Sometimes I waited
for him to complain


348
00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.435
"or start a fight,

349
00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:57.101
"but his calm exterior
remained intact.


350
00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:59.977
His coolness
drove me frantic."


351
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:04.602
- My career was not igniting
like hers was,


352
00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:07.977
but that wasn't really
a very big factor


353
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.602
in the fact
that we separated


354
00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:11.810
and then finally divorced.

355
00:16:11.894 --> 00:16:14.602
It was the pressure on her
and her career


356
00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:16.602
that caused that, and also,

357
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.393
I think that
I might have been able


358
00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.769
to handle it
a little bit better.


359
00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:20.977
If I'd have been
a little bit older


360
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.268
and had more experience,

361
00:16:22.351 --> 00:16:23.602
I might have been able

362
00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:25.268
to have worked it out.

363
00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:27.268
- Any rumors
that you've heard--


364
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.060
I mean, I'm here to say

365
00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:31.935
that Warren Beatty,
who was her costar


366
00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:33.560
in "Splendor in the Grass,"

367
00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:36.977
was not the problem at all,

368
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.685
and there definitely
did not develop


369
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:41.769
a relationship
between them


370
00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:46.143
until long after
"Splendor" had wrapped.


371
00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:48.310
- We were separated,
and Warren, I think,


372
00:16:48.393 --> 00:16:51.518
was very much taken by her,
and why wouldn't he be?


373
00:16:51.602 --> 00:16:53.477
But that was
a very difficult time


374
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.518
because I was so upset

375
00:16:55.602 --> 00:16:57.643
and so disturbed
by everything,


376
00:16:57.727 --> 00:16:59.310
I was ready
to go after him.


377
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.810
I can talk about that
pretty easily now,


378
00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:03.268
but at the time,
it was a little bit difficult,


379
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.810
as you can imagine.

380
00:17:04.894 --> 00:17:07.560
- The relationship between her
and Warren Beatty was hot.


381
00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:08.935
You could almost not look
at them.


382
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:10.310
Your eyes were gonna burn out.

383
00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:12.852
They were so good-looking.

384
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.101
- I was alone,

385
00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:16.019
I didn't have anybody
in my life,


386
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:19.226
and I just couldn't stay
in Los Angeles anymore


387
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.685
and be alone,

388
00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:22.351
and I made a decision

389
00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:23.518
to move to Europe.

390
00:17:23.602 --> 00:17:25.185
So I talked to her,

391
00:17:25.268 --> 00:17:27.602
and I said I was going
to Europe.


392
00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:30.060
"Do you feel like you'd want
to come there?"


393
00:17:30.143 --> 00:17:34.226
And she said,
"No, I have other plans,"


394
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.727
and I said, "Okay,"
and I hung up the phone,


395
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.060
and that was it.

396
00:17:42.518 --> 00:17:44.226
- "Neither Warren nor I
was ready


397
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.185
"for a permanent relationship,

398
00:17:46.268 --> 00:17:49.894
"although our romance lasted
approximately two years.


399
00:17:49.977 --> 00:17:53.393
"Our affair was a collision
from start to finish.


400
00:17:53.477 --> 00:17:56.019
"While RJ never did
express hostility,


401
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:57.852
"Warren couldn't stop,

402
00:17:57.935 --> 00:18:00.602
"and I contributed
my share of fireworks too.


403
00:18:00.685 --> 00:18:02.602
"In fact, we were both
so confused


404
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.727
"that we thought fighting
and hostility


405
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.477
meant real emotional honesty."

406
00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:12.060
After her relationship
with Warren had broken up,


407
00:18:12.143 --> 00:18:14.894
my mom had a string
of relationships,


408
00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:16.268
and during the '60s,

409
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.268
before she married
my Daddy Gregson,


410
00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:20.435
she had a couple
of broken engagements,


411
00:18:20.518 --> 00:18:22.602
one with Arthur Loew Jr.,

412
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.060
who remained
a very close friend of hers,


413
00:18:25.143 --> 00:18:26.935
another with Ladislav Blatnik,

414
00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:30.060
who was known as the shoe king
of Venezuela,


415
00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:33.351
but I think that my mom
was longing


416
00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:36.185
to be taken care of
emotionally,


417
00:18:36.268 --> 00:18:38.226
and I think that's
what she was looking for


418
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.060
during that time.

419
00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:42.060
- I was flattered
that I was, I think,


420
00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:44.185
the only one she ever dated
who was younger than she,


421
00:18:44.268 --> 00:18:46.226
and I was four years younger
than she was.


422
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.727
Didn't bother me.
Didn't bother her.


423
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.935
But it was never
gonna go anywhere.


424
00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:52.977
It was never supposed
to go anywhere.


425
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.143
It was fun
for as long as it lasted,


426
00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:58.560
and it--the friendship lasted
way beyond the dating period.


427
00:19:00.852 --> 00:19:02.268
- "For the first time
in my life,


428
00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:04.268
"I considered, in horror,

429
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:06.268
"the possibility
that I might join


430
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:08.977
"that sad parade
of famous movie ladies


431
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.268
"who wind up
desperately lonely


432
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.977
"with nothing more substantial
to sustain them


433
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.477
"than their scrapbooks
and old photos


434
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.226
"and memories of romances
and divorces.


435
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.727
"My ex-husband's first child
had just been born.


436
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.435
"I cried when I heard
the news.


437
00:19:26.518 --> 00:19:28.935
"It wasn't only
from the sense of loss I felt


438
00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.810
"for something
we never shared.


439
00:19:30.894 --> 00:19:34.143
It was also happiness
for him."


440
00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:35.685
- My mom's name
was Marion Marshall


441
00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:37.643
when she was
in the picture business,


442
00:19:37.727 --> 00:19:40.685
Marion Donen when she was
married to Stanley Donen,


443
00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:42.310
and she had two boys,

444
00:19:42.393 --> 00:19:44.435
my brothers Josh Donen
and Peter Donen,


445
00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:46.685
who are eight and ten years
older than me.


446
00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:51.602
- I left Los Angeles
and lived in Rome


447
00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:53.435
for three years,

448
00:19:53.518 --> 00:19:54.685
and I saw Marion,

449
00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:56.185
and Marion and I
started going out,


450
00:19:56.268 --> 00:19:58.351
traveling all over Europe
together,


451
00:19:58.435 --> 00:19:59.727
and fell in love
with each other


452
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.477
and got married and came back
to the United States.


453
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.852
She had two sons,
Peter and Josh.


454
00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:07.185
I loved these two boys,

455
00:20:07.268 --> 00:20:09.019
and we had
a wonderful life together,


456
00:20:09.101 --> 00:20:12.560
and I had a daughter with her
called Katie,


457
00:20:12.643 --> 00:20:15.226
and that was a joy in my life.

458
00:20:20.935 --> 00:20:22.560
- Here we are in Wales

459
00:20:22.643 --> 00:20:25.226
at my father
Richard Gregson's house.


460
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.560
My dad has Parkinson's
at this point in his life,


461
00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:32.143
and this might be
one of the last times


462
00:20:32.226 --> 00:20:34.560
we get to speak about my mom.

463
00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:01.852
- I was with her
the night she met your father.


464
00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:03.560
They started seeing
each other, dating,


465
00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:06.143
and it got serious.

466
00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:07.894
- Richard Gregson
was my agent,


467
00:21:07.977 --> 00:21:09.727
and then he became
a producer


468
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.935
from being my agent,

469
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:12.602
and right from the beginning,
I saw him


470
00:21:12.685 --> 00:21:15.560
as a very, very smart,
elegant guy


471
00:21:15.643 --> 00:21:17.560
and very, very sophisticated,

472
00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.602
more so than any of the agents
that I knew in Hollywood.


473
00:21:20.685 --> 00:21:22.727
And I was best man
at their wedding.


474
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.769
- I remember a story
with him saying


475
00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:28.101
that he asked all his wives
to marry him


476
00:21:28.185 --> 00:21:30.060
but they turned him down,

477
00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:32.435
so he then had to wait
for them to ask him.


478
00:21:32.518 --> 00:21:34.602
And eventually,
Natalie asked him


479
00:21:34.685 --> 00:21:36.310
to marry him,
and they'd been together


480
00:21:36.393 --> 00:21:37.977
for three or four years
at that time.


481
00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.435
- And they had
a big, big, fancy wedding


482
00:21:40.518 --> 00:21:42.810
at a Russian church,
Russian ceremony,


483
00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:44.810
and it was beautiful.

484
00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:54.810
- How long have you
been married now?


485
00:21:54.894 --> 00:21:56.101
- Five months.
- Five months.


486
00:21:56.185 --> 00:21:58.602
- Five months.
And they said it wouldn't last.


487
00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:01.769
- Don't say that!

488
00:22:01.852 --> 00:22:03.060
- And you've been quoted
as saying


489
00:22:03.143 --> 00:22:04.268
you wouldn't now take a film

490
00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:06.643
that was thousands of miles
apart?


491
00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:08.101
- Not if it meant
being away from Richard,


492
00:22:08.185 --> 00:22:10.310
no, I wouldn't.

493
00:22:10.393 --> 00:22:11.977
- How long have you
been married, Robert?


494
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.560
- 11 years.

495
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.977
- And what advice would you
give this young couple?


496
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.643
- Yes, Redford,
tell us what to do.


497
00:22:22.727 --> 00:22:25.643
- Well, just try to keep track

498
00:22:25.727 --> 00:22:27.185
of how many years
you're married


499
00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:30.643
and, you know, remember
the dates when they come up.


500
00:22:30.727 --> 00:22:32.101
- That's right, 'cause somebody
asked you last week,


501
00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:33.852
and they said, "What day
were you married on?"


502
00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:36.977
and simultaneously,
I said May 30th,


503
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.727
and he said May 31st.

504
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.685
- You don't need to ask
who was wrong, right?


505
00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:42.185
- Yeah.

506
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.685
- There's nothing
quite like finding out


507
00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:05.185
for the very first time

508
00:23:05.268 --> 00:23:06.310
that you're gonna be pregnant

509
00:23:06.393 --> 00:23:08.727
and to go through
that first pregnancy.


510
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.685
There's just nothing ever
quite as miraculous as that.


511
00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:15.185
Ah.
- She didn't "get pregnant."


512
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:18.019
She got pregnant
because she wanted a baby,


513
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:20.226
so she was doing
what she wanted


514
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.185
and doing it well,
and then the work,


515
00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.602
she put it aside
for a while.


516
00:23:24.685 --> 00:23:26.019
She knew she'd get back to it.

517
00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:28.060
There was nothing
more important to Natalie


518
00:23:28.143 --> 00:23:30.685
than being a mom;
that was really clear.


519
00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:34.894
- I once walked in,
and she was coddling you,


520
00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:37.226
and she just looked up at me
and said,


521
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:42.435
"Who needs show business
when one has this?"


522
00:23:42.518 --> 00:23:45.602
My God, you were
the spitting image of her,


523
00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:47.393
you know, when you were born
and a child.


524
00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:49.393
It was incredible.

525
00:23:49.477 --> 00:23:50.935
- Before Natasha was born,

526
00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:53.060
she would do
a great deal of things with us.


527
00:23:53.143 --> 00:23:54.935
We'd go out,
we'd go to SeaWorld,


528
00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:56.268
we'd go to Disneyland,

529
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.602
but then
when Natasha was born,


530
00:23:58.685 --> 00:24:01.935
her sole focus, really,
I would say, was on Natasha.


531
00:24:12.643 --> 00:24:16.602
- Richard felt that Natalie
was so involved


532
00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:18.435
and emotionally connected
to Natasha


533
00:24:18.518 --> 00:24:20.977
that there wasn't any room
for him,


534
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.894
so he did something
really stupid


535
00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:24.727
and got thrown out.

536
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.810
- What happened when you
and Mommy got divorced?


537
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.310
- Changed the locks, I think.

538
00:24:56.393 --> 00:24:58.019
- I love the story

539
00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:59.810
about how you
and Mommy reconnected


540
00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:02.310
at your friend
John Foreman's party.


541
00:25:02.393 --> 00:25:04.310
- We saw each other
at this party,


542
00:25:04.393 --> 00:25:06.852
and so the sparks
sort of flew a little bit,


543
00:25:06.935 --> 00:25:08.769
and then I offered
to drive her home,


544
00:25:08.852 --> 00:25:11.435
and I did drive her home
and dropped her off


545
00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:13.143
and said good night
to her, and...


546
00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:16.977
- And then she got
into her house on Bentley


547
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.977
and started to cry,

548
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.477
and then what did you do?

549
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.518
- I drove down the street,
and I stopped,


550
00:25:23.602 --> 00:25:26.685
and I had tears in my eyes
as well.


551
00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:27.977
- Because you guys realized

552
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.977
that you still missed
each other.


553
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.769
- How come you got married
to Bob Wagner again?


554
00:25:32.852 --> 00:25:34.019
- Again?
- I mean, and how does it feel


555
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:37.310
when you marry your husband
after you divorced him?


556
00:25:37.393 --> 00:25:38.810
And if you don't want
to talk about it, we'll pass.


557
00:25:38.894 --> 00:25:39.894
- Oh, it feels terrific.

558
00:25:39.977 --> 00:25:41.143
I don't mind talking about it.
- Okay.


559
00:25:41.226 --> 00:25:42.518
- I was just fortunate,
you know?


560
00:25:42.602 --> 00:25:44.602
Timing was on our side.

561
00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:47.852
We happened to meet at a time
when we were both free.


562
00:25:47.935 --> 00:25:50.810
The fact that we both had
feelings toward the other one


563
00:25:50.894 --> 00:25:52.310
we didn't keep to ourselves.

564
00:25:52.393 --> 00:25:53.852
I mean, we managed
to convey that.


565
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:56.852
Because I really had no idea
that RJ


566
00:25:56.935 --> 00:25:59.685
felt something still toward me,
even though I knew that I did,


567
00:25:59.769 --> 00:26:02.351
and he felt the same way
and didn't know if I did.


568
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:06.393
But luckily, we didn't
keep that to ourselves.


569
00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:10.852
- I came into Natalie's life
through RJ.


570
00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:14.351
RJ married my mother,

571
00:26:14.435 --> 00:26:16.268
and when RJ
and my mother divorced,


572
00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:18.560
I remained very close to RJ,

573
00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:22.268
so when he started
seeing Natalie again,


574
00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:25.685
naturally, that's how I was
introduced to Natalie,


575
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.935
and after college,

576
00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.852
Natalie said, "Come and live
in our guest house,"


577
00:26:30.935 --> 00:26:33.060
and I stayed there for years,

578
00:26:33.143 --> 00:26:34.518
and that's when we became
really close.


579
00:26:34.602 --> 00:26:36.685
You know, and it was clear,
seeing them together,


580
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:39.393
that they loved each other,
but it was more.


581
00:26:39.477 --> 00:26:43.268
It seemed to me that they
should be together.


582
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.060
This seemed right.

583
00:26:46.143 --> 00:26:48.602
- When you and Mommy
got back together,


584
00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:51.351
she was a mom
and you were a dad.


585
00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:52.894
- That's right.
- And you guys had had


586
00:26:52.977 --> 00:26:54.435
ten years between.

587
00:26:54.518 --> 00:26:56.894
So had you both
really grown up?


588
00:26:56.977 --> 00:26:58.060
- I think so.

589
00:26:58.143 --> 00:26:59.435
You know,
when we were younger,


590
00:26:59.518 --> 00:27:01.643
we were very interested
in our careers


591
00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:03.226
and where we could go
with it,


592
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.143
and that became less important
the second time.


593
00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:09.101
I mean, it had more
to do with us


594
00:27:09.185 --> 00:27:12.435
and you and Katie.

595
00:27:12.518 --> 00:27:14.477
- It was pretty exciting
to be a part of that


596
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.060
relationship
and that love affair.


597
00:27:16.643 --> 00:27:18.810
And then they got married
the second time around


598
00:27:18.894 --> 00:27:20.393
on the "Ramblin' Rose,"

599
00:27:20.477 --> 00:27:21.560
and it was just
an incredible day.


600
00:27:21.643 --> 00:27:22.935
It was a small group
of people,


601
00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:24.602
probably about 30 people.

602
00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:29.769
- We got married
in Paradise Cove,


603
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.935
and then we went
from Paradise Cove


604
00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:33.101
over to the Isthmus,

605
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:35.477
and we spent our honeymoon
in Catalina.


606
00:27:38.685 --> 00:27:40.769
- Clearly, RJ was
the love of her life,


607
00:27:40.852 --> 00:27:41.977
because when they got
back together,


608
00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:44.977
it was like just two parts
of the same whole


609
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.310
coming together again,

610
00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:48.602
and I saw her
in a more complete way.


611
00:27:48.685 --> 00:27:51.019
You know,
she was totally happy.


612
00:27:53.518 --> 00:27:55.310
- Natalie, you tried
natural childbirth


613
00:27:55.393 --> 00:27:56.643
with your second child.

614
00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:58.643
- Well, with my first child,
I did have--


615
00:27:58.727 --> 00:27:59.935
- You tried it?
- I was awake,


616
00:28:00.019 --> 00:28:01.268
and I watched Natasha
being born.


617
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.810
- Mm-hmm.
- And with Courtney,


618
00:28:02.894 --> 00:28:04.268
suddenly, there were
complications,


619
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:07.643
you know, after about

620
00:28:07.727 --> 00:28:09.810
and all of a sudden,
the doctor said,


621
00:28:09.894 --> 00:28:11.852
"Oh, no, this is gonna be
an emergency section,"


622
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:13.185
and he got Courtney out
in two minutes,


623
00:28:13.268 --> 00:28:14.518
saved her life.

624
00:28:18.143 --> 00:28:21.393
- I was born March 9, 1974,

625
00:28:21.477 --> 00:28:23.143
and I think there was a big--

626
00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:25.226
like, a whole thing
in the paper


627
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.143
saying that, like,
I was near death and--


628
00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:30.560
but I was the lovechild.

629
00:28:38.477 --> 00:28:40.685
- I had had Katie
with Marion,


630
00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:43.393
and she had had Natasha
with Richard,


631
00:28:43.477 --> 00:28:45.643
and we had Courtney together,

632
00:28:45.727 --> 00:28:48.685
so we were--we were thrilled.

633
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.477
- Do you know something more
the second time around?


634
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.143
- I know to appreciate him
for what--


635
00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:55.727
- Oh, you're taking
the blame, huh?


636
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.894
You didn't appreciate him
first time around?


637
00:28:56.977 --> 00:28:58.185
- No, no, no.
Not necessarily.


638
00:28:58.268 --> 00:29:00.351
I think we both appreciate
each other more,


639
00:29:00.435 --> 00:29:03.477
and I think we know
each other better as people,


640
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.060
and we're kind of
on the same wavelength.


641
00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:06.602
You know, we like to do
the same things,


642
00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:08.393
and we like
hanging out together.


643
00:29:08.477 --> 00:29:10.060
We like hanging out
with the kids.


644
00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:15.560
- When we got married,
we were living in the Springs.


645
00:29:15.643 --> 00:29:18.019
I had this home
in Palm Springs.


646
00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:19.727
And then we found this house

647
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.060
on Cañon Drive
in Beverly Hills,


648
00:29:22.143 --> 00:29:24.977
and then we bought that
and moved into there.


649
00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:31.060
- When we were all very much
a family in the '70s,


650
00:29:31.143 --> 00:29:33.310
it was you, Mommy,
Courtney, and I,


651
00:29:33.393 --> 00:29:35.393
and Katie came
and lived with us,


652
00:29:35.477 --> 00:29:37.226
and that was our group

653
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.101
with visits
from Josh and Peter,


654
00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:42.560
Sarah, Charlotte,
and Hugo.


655
00:29:42.643 --> 00:29:44.268
- The guest house
was rather filled, wasn't it?


656
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:46.185
- Yeah, it was always
turning over,


657
00:29:46.268 --> 00:29:47.435
and many, many dogs,

658
00:29:47.518 --> 00:29:49.226
many cats, many birds,
many--


659
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.518
- Lizards.
- Lizards.


660
00:29:50.602 --> 00:29:52.602
- Ducks.

661
00:29:52.685 --> 00:29:55.769
- We had this amazing nanny
named Willie Mae


662
00:29:55.852 --> 00:29:57.477
who lived with us
until she passed away


663
00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.435
at the age of 90.

664
00:29:59.518 --> 00:30:00.643
- Great lady.

665
00:30:00.727 --> 00:30:03.435
- I was really attached
to Willie Mae.


666
00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:05.727
I was always much more
attached to Willie Mae,


667
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:06.977
really, than my mom.

668
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.643
I felt that Natasha
had my mom


669
00:30:08.727 --> 00:30:09.935
and I had Willie Mae.

670
00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:11.560
And then, you know,
we had each other,


671
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.226
but I just--I don't know
what it was about Willie Mae.


672
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.268
I just loved Willie Mae
so much.


673
00:30:16.351 --> 00:30:19.101
- Willie Mae Worthen
was the nanny,


674
00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:20.268
who I adored.

675
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:21.435
Everybody adored her.

676
00:30:21.518 --> 00:30:24.935
She was this six-foot giant
from down South,


677
00:30:25.019 --> 00:30:27.560
very brusque but loving.

678
00:30:27.643 --> 00:30:30.019
She was part of the family.

679
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:32.643
And I was Natalie Wood's
personal assistant


680
00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:33.977
for four years.

681
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.643
My office was literally

682
00:30:35.727 --> 00:30:37.643
in the corner
of the master bedroom.


683
00:30:37.727 --> 00:30:39.852
These two were in bed.

684
00:30:39.935 --> 00:30:42.310
It was quite--
it was quite funny, actually,


685
00:30:42.393 --> 00:30:45.643
to be in that situation,
having come from an office.


686
00:30:45.727 --> 00:30:49.685
And Natalie would give
incredible parties,


687
00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:51.143
but the main one each year

688
00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:53.143
would be
the New Year's Eve party.


689
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:54.185
The guests would come.

690
00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:56.060
There would be
George Segal and his wife.


691
00:30:56.143 --> 00:30:58.477
There would be Gregory Peck,
Jimmy Stewart,


692
00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.977
Roddy McDowall.

693
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.185
- I look to my right,

694
00:31:01.268 --> 00:31:03.351
and there I saw,

695
00:31:03.435 --> 00:31:05.393
I swear to God,

696
00:31:05.477 --> 00:31:08.643
Fred Astaire singing
Cole Porter


697
00:31:08.727 --> 00:31:10.310
with a pianist
accompanying him,


698
00:31:10.393 --> 00:31:11.727
and he finished his song,

699
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.351
and everybody burst
into applause.


700
00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:14.894
- Those parties were the best.

701
00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:16.685
You'd be talking
to someone


702
00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:20.351
and turn around, and, ooh,
Sir Laurence Olivier.


703
00:31:20.435 --> 00:31:22.518
Now I have to figure out
what kind of conversation


704
00:31:22.602 --> 00:31:24.351
I can have with him.

705
00:31:24.435 --> 00:31:28.518
And the house was just
so full of love


706
00:31:28.602 --> 00:31:30.518
and happiness,

707
00:31:30.602 --> 00:31:33.685
it made you feel good
to be there.


708
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:34.852
- So many people
coming and going


709
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:37.185
in the Cañon Drive house
that were not only famous


710
00:31:37.268 --> 00:31:38.560
but just friends, you know,

711
00:31:38.643 --> 00:31:39.852
really, really great friends.

712
00:31:39.935 --> 00:31:41.852
They had parties
all the time.


713
00:31:41.935 --> 00:31:43.602
You know,
our holidays were huge.


714
00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:45.727
Courtney got as many presents
at Natasha's birthday


715
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.310
as Natasha got
at Courtney's birthday.


716
00:31:59.643 --> 00:32:01.226
- Everything was heaven.

717
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.560
The house was so beautiful
and also welcoming,


718
00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:07.060
and Natalie was so candid,

719
00:32:07.143 --> 00:32:09.518
and the focus was the children,
not the grown-ups.


720
00:32:13.143 --> 00:32:15.685
- I remember the parties.
I remember the laughter.


721
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:18.060
I remember they were
so in love with each other,


722
00:32:18.143 --> 00:32:20.060
and my mom would always say,

723
00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:21.769
"Oh, RJ, honestly!"

724
00:32:21.852 --> 00:32:24.019
but then she would, like,
break out laughing.


725
00:32:24.101 --> 00:32:26.060
They were just always
laughing.


726
00:32:26.143 --> 00:32:28.769
- That connection
that they had


727
00:32:28.852 --> 00:32:30.685
is what I remember
growing up.


728
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:33.351
And they were always
buying each other presents,


729
00:32:33.435 --> 00:32:35.769
and my mom
was always concocting


730
00:32:35.852 --> 00:32:37.435
some kind
of an incredible surprise


731
00:32:37.518 --> 00:32:39.685
for my dad
that she would tell us about.


732
00:32:41.019 --> 00:32:43.435
- The most important thing
for me is my family


733
00:32:43.518 --> 00:32:45.310
and my husband, my kids.

734
00:32:45.393 --> 00:32:46.935
That's why we like spending
a lot of time on the boat,


735
00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:49.226
where we really are
just a family


736
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.935
and there aren't a lot
of other things to relate to.


737
00:32:52.019 --> 00:32:54.810
- We got a boat together,
the "Splendour,"


738
00:32:54.894 --> 00:32:56.977
and we spent most weekends

739
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.769
and most vacations
in Catalina.


740
00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:00.894
We spent a lot of time
on that island.


741
00:33:02.351 --> 00:33:04.435
- Natalie never cooked at home,

742
00:33:04.518 --> 00:33:06.935
but she would always
cook breakfast on the boat,


743
00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:09.143
and it was huevos rancheros,

744
00:33:09.226 --> 00:33:11.268
and she enjoyed the boat.

745
00:33:11.351 --> 00:33:14.310
You know, she'd have
the hat on and the outfit.


746
00:33:14.393 --> 00:33:16.435
It was fun for the family,
and it was fun


747
00:33:16.518 --> 00:33:19.685
for RJ and Natalie
to get away as well.


748
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.435
- My parents were very relaxed
on the boat.


749
00:33:33.518 --> 00:33:36.143
They'd bring other friends,
or we'd bring our friends.


750
00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:38.477
We'd go to Catalina.
We'd go to Emerald Bay.


751
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.977
We'd go to the Isthmus.

752
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.060
And it was a really happy time
for us there.


753
00:33:46.226 --> 00:33:48.643
- As we reported earlier,
actress Natalie Wood


754
00:33:48.727 --> 00:33:49.977
was found dead today.

755
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.685
Her body was discovered
fully clothed


756
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:54.019
in waters
off Santa Catalina Island.


757
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:56.268
Los Angeles County officials
can only confirm


758
00:33:56.351 --> 00:33:58.643
the 43-year-old Ms. Wood
drowned,


759
00:33:58.727 --> 00:34:01.185
but nothing further
on the circumstances.


760
00:34:01.268 --> 00:34:03.852
David Burrington reports.

761
00:34:03.935 --> 00:34:05.393
- Natalie Wood
and her husband,


762
00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:06.852
actor Robert Wagner,

763
00:34:06.935 --> 00:34:08.518
had sailed to Catalina Island

764
00:34:08.602 --> 00:34:11.226
to spend the holiday weekend
with friends.


765
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.310
Apparently, they had returned
to their yacht,


766
00:34:13.393 --> 00:34:15.685
the "Splendour,"
after dinner,


767
00:34:15.769 --> 00:34:17.393
when Natalie went back out
on the water


768
00:34:17.477 --> 00:34:18.977
in this rubber boat.

769
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.643
Exactly what happened then,
nobody knows,


770
00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:24.185
but her body was found
after dawn this morning


771
00:34:24.268 --> 00:34:27.351
in a small cove
not far from the rubber boat.


772
00:34:27.435 --> 00:34:29.143
- It was on the news,

773
00:34:29.226 --> 00:34:31.769
and I called our mutual friend
Leonard Gershe,


774
00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:34.226
and I said,
"Is Natalie all right?"


775
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.393
And he said, "No.
Nat's..."


776
00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:43.894
Natalie was gone.

777
00:34:43.977 --> 00:34:46.894
- I remember being devastated
by that news


778
00:34:46.977 --> 00:34:51.393
and, having such affection
for her,


779
00:34:51.477 --> 00:34:53.185
hurt by the news.

780
00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:54.727
- The phone rang,

781
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.393
and I pick up the phone...

782
00:34:56.477 --> 00:35:00.435
And RJ screams

783
00:35:00.518 --> 00:35:02.060
into the phone...

784
00:35:05.977 --> 00:35:08.101
"She's gone!"

785
00:35:08.185 --> 00:35:11.393
- My brother Peter Donen
called me--my late brother--


786
00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:13.060
called me about 6:00
in the morning,


787
00:35:13.143 --> 00:35:15.560
and he--I picked up my phone
in my room,


788
00:35:15.643 --> 00:35:19.518
and he said, "Natalie's dead.
She drowned."


789
00:35:19.602 --> 00:35:21.310
And I thought to myself,
"Well, she drowned,


790
00:35:21.393 --> 00:35:22.685
but she'll be back, right?"

791
00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:24.393
I mean, that weird thing
that you think


792
00:35:24.477 --> 00:35:26.268
when you hear
something like that.


793
00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:27.602
- I was walking
along the beach,


794
00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:29.268
and it was early
in the morning,


795
00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:32.060
and I saw my brother

796
00:35:32.143 --> 00:35:33.643
came out onto the beach,

797
00:35:33.727 --> 00:35:35.602
and he came over to me;
he put his arms around me.


798
00:35:35.685 --> 00:35:37.977
He said, "Natalie's died."

799
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.351
And I was just
in a state of shock.


800
00:35:40.435 --> 00:35:43.477
- That was one
of the worst mornings


801
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.060
that we've ever experienced.

802
00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:50.643
So we got in the car
and went over to Cañon,


803
00:35:50.727 --> 00:35:53.268
and already, there was press
out in the street


804
00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:55.268
and cameras
and all of that,


805
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.560
and we were there
before RJ was there.


806
00:35:57.643 --> 00:35:59.935
- Eventually, RJ came home,

807
00:36:00.019 --> 00:36:01.477
and we went downstairs,

808
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.810
and he came in
looking like death.


809
00:36:04.894 --> 00:36:08.268
- I remember Willie Mae
woke me up,


810
00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:12.810
and I could hear
my sister Natasha crying,


811
00:36:12.894 --> 00:36:14.477
and I saw all of these people

812
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.185
in the living room,

813
00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:17.977
and I was walking
down the steps,


814
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.477
and my dad was at the edge
of the steps,


815
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.019
and he said to me, "You know,
you're not gonna see


816
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:24.351
your mom anymore."

817
00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:28.185
- He said,
"But I want you to know


818
00:36:28.268 --> 00:36:30.477
"that we're going to be
all right.


819
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.435
"We're staying together,

820
00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:34.310
"we're still a family,

821
00:36:34.393 --> 00:36:36.810
and we're gonna get
through this."


822
00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:40.101
It was heavy-duty stuff,

823
00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:42.852
and he just clung on to them

824
00:36:42.935 --> 00:36:44.685
and they on him.

825
00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:47.852
- It's like, the instant
that my mom passed away


826
00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:51.518
is like the air in the balloon
that was our life, you know,


827
00:36:51.602 --> 00:36:53.518
it just--it just--

828
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:56.477
you know, it just--
the party was over.


829
00:37:02.852 --> 00:37:05.852
- I remember hearing
that my grandma fainted,


830
00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:07.685
but I remember
that I didn't want


831
00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:09.351
to be around my grandma

832
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:11.852
because she was
too hysterical.


833
00:37:11.935 --> 00:37:14.685
I think I was more
of a private griever,


834
00:37:14.769 --> 00:37:19.351
and my grandma
was so kind of colorful


835
00:37:19.435 --> 00:37:22.060
with her grief,

836
00:37:22.143 --> 00:37:24.685
so I didn't feel safe
around her.


837
00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:27.560
- I remember my grandmother
being really--


838
00:37:27.643 --> 00:37:30.226
I mean, talk about someone
that was checked out.


839
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.393
I mean, she would just faint,
you know.


840
00:37:32.477 --> 00:37:34.435
She was very dramatic too.

841
00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.226
I mean, there would be times
where you would hear


842
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.769
that, like, she suddenly
just got frightened


843
00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:39.935
and she ran into a wall

844
00:37:40.019 --> 00:37:41.101
because she wasn't
paying attention.


845
00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:43.226
I mean, she was just--
you know, this was a woman


846
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.268
that was grief-stricken

847
00:37:45.351 --> 00:37:49.894
and whose whole life
revolved around her daughter.


848
00:37:52.643 --> 00:37:54.810
- My mom's parents,
my grandparents,


849
00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:57.101
were Nick and Maria Gurdin.

850
00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:59.351
They spoke with these
thick Russian accents


851
00:37:59.435 --> 00:38:01.019
because they were
both immigrants


852
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:03.769
who met and married
in San Francisco.


853
00:38:03.852 --> 00:38:06.727
My mom called her parents
Mud and Fad,


854
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.935
short for Mudda and Fadda.

855
00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:11.393
My mom was the middle child
of three girls.


856
00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:13.769
She had an older half sister
named Olga


857
00:38:13.852 --> 00:38:15.769
who was ten years older
than her


858
00:38:15.852 --> 00:38:19.643
and a younger sister, Lana,
who was eight years younger.


859
00:38:19.727 --> 00:38:22.226
- My parents moved
from San Francisco


860
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.310
to Santa Rosa
when I was about two, I think,


861
00:38:25.393 --> 00:38:28.101
and then a movie company
came to Santa Rosa


862
00:38:28.185 --> 00:38:30.727
on location, and they needed
a little girl


863
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.602
to drop an ice cream cone
and cry,


864
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:35.560
and I think my mama gave me
a little nudge


865
00:38:35.643 --> 00:38:37.310
in the right direction
and said,


866
00:38:37.393 --> 00:38:38.977
"Why don't you go talk
to that nice man,


867
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.685
sing him some of your songs?"

868
00:38:40.769 --> 00:38:43.226
And...

869
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.393
So I did, and he chose me
to drop the ice cream cone,


870
00:38:46.477 --> 00:38:50.185
and then he remembered me
a year later


871
00:38:50.268 --> 00:38:51.977
when he was doing
"Tomorrow is Forever."


872
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.435
His name was Irving Pichel,

873
00:38:53.518 --> 00:38:55.101
and he wrote to my parents
and said


874
00:38:55.185 --> 00:38:56.977
that he would like
to have me come


875
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.852
to Los Angeles
and do a screen test


876
00:38:58.935 --> 00:39:01.351
because he had a part
for a young German girl,


877
00:39:01.435 --> 00:39:04.143
and against
my father's deeper wishes,


878
00:39:04.226 --> 00:39:06.935
my mother and I
traveled down by train,


879
00:39:07.019 --> 00:39:09.268
and I made the screen test,
got the part,


880
00:39:09.351 --> 00:39:13.019
and it seemed a good idea
to move down to Los Angeles,


881
00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:15.435
which we then did,
and my father began working


882
00:39:15.518 --> 00:39:18.769
in the miniature prop
department at the studios,


883
00:39:18.852 --> 00:39:20.477
so we would sometimes
bump into each other.


884
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.810
We were both working.

885
00:39:22.894 --> 00:39:25.101
Shall we go away soon,
Father?


886
00:39:27.727 --> 00:39:29.143
- Go?

887
00:39:29.226 --> 00:39:31.518
- You said maybe
we would leave here.


888
00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:34.310
- I was her first leading man,

889
00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:37.019
and for six or seven takes,

890
00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:39.351
I kept blowing my lines.

891
00:39:39.435 --> 00:39:41.019
Not Natalie.

892
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:42.560
I think it was
her first picture,


893
00:39:42.643 --> 00:39:45.560
but she was already
a perfect little pro.


894
00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:47.185
- Well, young lady,
what's your name?


895
00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:49.477
- Susan Walker.
What's yours?


896
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.685
- Mine?
Kriss Kringle.


897
00:39:51.769 --> 00:39:54.226
I'm Santa Claus.

898
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.019
Oh, you don't believe that,
do you?


899
00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:58.226
- Mm-mm.

900
00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.019
You see, my mother's
Mrs. Walker,


901
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:02.894
the lady who hired you.
- Oh.


902
00:40:02.977 --> 00:40:04.060
- But I must say,

903
00:40:04.143 --> 00:40:05.685
you're the best-looking one
I've ever seen.


904
00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:07.477
- Really?
- Your beard doesn't have


905
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.393
one of those things
that goes over your ears.


906
00:40:09.477 --> 00:40:10.852
- Well, that's because
it's real,


907
00:40:10.935 --> 00:40:13.185
just like I'm
really Santa Claus.


908
00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:16.310
- What stands out about
Natalie Wood's performance


909
00:40:16.393 --> 00:40:18.977
in "Miracle on 34th Street"
is,


910
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.310
there's no artifice.

911
00:40:20.393 --> 00:40:23.727
She's so watchful
and skeptical


912
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.435
and very sure-seeming
in who she was,


913
00:40:27.518 --> 00:40:29.727
and then in the end,
she had the same dreams


914
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.393
and fantasies
as everybody else,


915
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:35.977
and I think that's what was
so appealing about it.


916
00:40:38.643 --> 00:40:42.185
- "The reality of Hollywood
was a dash of cold water.


917
00:40:42.268 --> 00:40:44.769
"Instead of glamour,
I found myself immersed


918
00:40:44.852 --> 00:40:46.894
"in work and study.

919
00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.435
"By the time I was 12,

920
00:40:48.518 --> 00:40:51.602
"my father suffered the first
of a series of heart attacks.


921
00:40:51.685 --> 00:40:54.143
"For a few years,
he couldn't work at all.


922
00:40:54.226 --> 00:40:56.935
"This meant my acting
was the sole economic support


923
00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:58.602
"of my family,

924
00:40:58.685 --> 00:40:59.977
"and therefore, getting jobs

925
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.769
"became a tremendous
responsibility.


926
00:41:02.852 --> 00:41:04.268
"Sometimes I had nightmares

927
00:41:04.351 --> 00:41:08.143
about the family starving
if I didn't act."


928
00:41:08.226 --> 00:41:09.769
- The story I remember

929
00:41:09.852 --> 00:41:10.810
Natalie telling me
about her mother


930
00:41:10.894 --> 00:41:13.226
was an audition she went to,

931
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.435
and her mother felt
it hadn't gone terribly well,


932
00:41:16.518 --> 00:41:19.101
and on the way
out of the studio,


933
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:21.477
she said to Natalie,

934
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.727
"Well, that wasn't very good,
was it?


935
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.101
No new shoes for your sister."

936
00:41:26.185 --> 00:41:27.435
Of course,
Natalie was called back


937
00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.477
and did get the role,
so presumably,


938
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.810
Lana did get her new shoes.

939
00:41:33.685 --> 00:41:35.351
But there was a lot
of pressure


940
00:41:35.435 --> 00:41:36.852
on young Natalie.

941
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:41.310
- When she did a film
called "The Green Promise,"


942
00:41:41.393 --> 00:41:43.226
she injured her wrist...

943
00:41:46.935 --> 00:41:48.310
And it never healed properly,

944
00:41:48.393 --> 00:41:51.268
and so her wrist bone
was bigger


945
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:52.810
on one wrist than the other,

946
00:41:52.894 --> 00:41:54.769
and she felt
self-conscious about it,


947
00:41:54.852 --> 00:41:58.185
so she always wore
a bracelet to cover it up.


948
00:41:58.268 --> 00:41:59.685
- She had a bracelet
she always wore,


949
00:41:59.769 --> 00:42:02.310
and it covered up
a thing on her wrist,


950
00:42:02.393 --> 00:42:04.268
and it always
kind of made me think,


951
00:42:04.351 --> 00:42:06.143
"This is a woman
in total control


952
00:42:06.226 --> 00:42:09.852
but had a flaw
that she was aware of."


953
00:42:09.935 --> 00:42:12.185
Didn't mean anything,
but in a way,


954
00:42:12.268 --> 00:42:15.852
it made me feel a connection
with her vulnerability


955
00:42:15.935 --> 00:42:18.477
and this childhood stardom
that she had had


956
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.685
that she was
childhood star, huge.


957
00:42:20.769 --> 00:42:23.518
- Don't you know that children
should be seen and not heard?


958
00:42:23.602 --> 00:42:25.143
- Not according to Jeremiah.

959
00:42:25.226 --> 00:42:26.560
"Say not I am a child,

960
00:42:26.643 --> 00:42:28.852
"for thou shalt go
to all that I shalt send thee,


961
00:42:28.935 --> 00:42:31.727
and whatsoever I command thee,
thou shalt speak."


962
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.226
- Steven, will you take her
away from here?


963
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.977
- Did you not feel
that you were missing


964
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.727
a lot of the fun
of being a child?


965
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.518
- Well, I wasn't aware of it
at the time, you know?


966
00:42:39.602 --> 00:42:40.852
I mean, I guess
I wasn't aware


967
00:42:40.935 --> 00:42:43.351
that other kids
did other things.


968
00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:46.477
And then
when I was about 12,


969
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.226
I started going
to a regular school


970
00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.727
in between jobs,

971
00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.894
and I did feel
a bit of a misfit then


972
00:42:51.977 --> 00:42:53.060
during that period,

973
00:42:53.143 --> 00:42:55.019
because I was
so comfortable with adults


974
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.685
and rather uncomfortable
with kids,


975
00:42:56.769 --> 00:42:58.560
having not been around
very many.


976
00:43:01.935 --> 00:43:04.685
- I met Natalie Wood
in junior high.


977
00:43:04.769 --> 00:43:06.351
She was very nice,
very pleasant.


978
00:43:06.435 --> 00:43:09.894
She wasn't, "Ha, look at me.
I'm a movie star,"


979
00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:11.560
not with anyone in the school,

980
00:43:11.643 --> 00:43:13.894
and they didn't treat her
like she was.


981
00:43:13.977 --> 00:43:15.894
But we became fast friends,

982
00:43:15.977 --> 00:43:18.560
and her mother
was very protective


983
00:43:18.643 --> 00:43:21.560
of who she chatted with,
who she went out with,


984
00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:24.226
and I passed
her mother's test.


985
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.685
So that was good.

986
00:43:27.769 --> 00:43:30.393
- Natalie's parents
were very involved with her.


987
00:43:30.477 --> 00:43:32.727
They knew everything
that she did


988
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.727
and where she went
and what she wore,


989
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.226
and they were
helicopter parents, you know?


990
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.894
They were always hovering
around her all the time.


991
00:43:40.977 --> 00:43:44.101
- Natalie's father, Nick,
he was very quiet.


992
00:43:44.185 --> 00:43:45.727
When I met him,

993
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.810
I think he had developed
a heart problem,


994
00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:50.602
and he generally was
a quiet, gentle man,


995
00:43:50.685 --> 00:43:51.643
that I knew.

996
00:43:51.727 --> 00:43:53.977
Didn't have
a lot of dialogue with him,


997
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.769
but with Maria, I did.

998
00:43:55.852 --> 00:43:57.435
She was a strange lady.

999
00:43:57.518 --> 00:43:59.769
She would say, "Don't walk
on that side of the road


1000
00:43:59.852 --> 00:44:01.101
"when the sun is shining,

1001
00:44:01.185 --> 00:44:03.310
because you'll be struck down."

1002
00:44:03.393 --> 00:44:06.477
And lots of little fears.

1003
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.602
- My grandma was
incredibly superstitious,


1004
00:44:09.685 --> 00:44:11.810
so she filled
my mom's head


1005
00:44:11.894 --> 00:44:14.268
with all kinds
of crazy stories.


1006
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:18.435
- I've always been terrified--
still am--of water,


1007
00:44:18.518 --> 00:44:21.602
dark water, seawater
or, you know, river water.


1008
00:44:21.685 --> 00:44:24.977
- There's this story
that a gypsy told my grandma


1009
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.727
that her second daughter
would become world-famous...


1010
00:44:29.894 --> 00:44:30.852
- Oh!

1011
00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:32.602
- But to beware
of dark water.


1012
00:44:35.226 --> 00:44:36.602
- Can you swim?

1013
00:44:36.685 --> 00:44:37.935
- A little!

1014
00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:39.810
- All right, cut.

1015
00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:41.685
- People are fixated
on the fact


1016
00:44:41.769 --> 00:44:43.477
that my mom was afraid
of dark water,


1017
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.685
I think,
simply because she drowned.


1018
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.769
But, you know, as a child,
she was in the pool with us


1019
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:49.727
all the time, and she and I

1020
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.143
never talked about her fear
of dark water,


1021
00:44:52.226 --> 00:44:55.727
so it never felt
like this big thing.


1022
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.685
I mean, who likes dark water?

1023
00:44:57.769 --> 00:45:00.351
It's not very enticing.

1024
00:45:00.435 --> 00:45:02.810
But my grandma
was so fantastical.


1025
00:45:02.894 --> 00:45:06.643
She was so twirling
and swirling with stories


1026
00:45:06.727 --> 00:45:09.143
that I don't know what was real
and what wasn't.


1027
00:45:09.226 --> 00:45:11.185
- I remember Natalie
was in bed,


1028
00:45:11.268 --> 00:45:12.769
studying her script,

1029
00:45:12.852 --> 00:45:16.393
and Maria was in one
of the second bedrooms,


1030
00:45:16.477 --> 00:45:19.727
and all of a sudden,
she started to tremble,


1031
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.393
and her eyes rolled up,

1032
00:45:21.477 --> 00:45:24.685
and I dashed
back into the room to Natalie.


1033
00:45:24.769 --> 00:45:26.894
I put her on the bed,
and I said, "Natalie,


1034
00:45:26.977 --> 00:45:28.518
"your mother, she's ill.

1035
00:45:28.602 --> 00:45:31.019
I think she's having
an epileptic fit."


1036
00:45:31.101 --> 00:45:33.101
And so Natalie said...

1037
00:45:34.477 --> 00:45:37.143
"She'll be all right
in a minute."


1038
00:45:37.226 --> 00:45:38.518
Never blinked an eye.

1039
00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.310
And it was from then I learned

1040
00:45:40.393 --> 00:45:44.019
that this was a regular habit
of Maria's to get attention.


1041
00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:46.019
- My mom's
very complicated relationship


1042
00:45:46.101 --> 00:45:48.185
with my grandma
and being a daughter


1043
00:45:48.268 --> 00:45:50.560
of a narcissistic,
controlling,


1044
00:45:50.643 --> 00:45:52.894
possessive mother--

1045
00:45:52.977 --> 00:45:55.393
I mean, that's played out
in so many of her films.


1046
00:45:55.477 --> 00:45:59.351
- On "Gypsy," your mother
actually said to me,


1047
00:45:59.435 --> 00:46:01.019
"I don't know
how I'm gonna play


1048
00:46:01.101 --> 00:46:03.019
this last scene,"

1049
00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:06.393
and I just nearly fell
on the floor, and I said,


1050
00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:09.101
"What?"

1051
00:46:09.185 --> 00:46:11.727
"You don't know
how to play that scene?


1052
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.351
"I mean, just look
at Rosalind Russell in the eye


1053
00:46:14.435 --> 00:46:17.060
"and pretend
it's your mother,


1054
00:46:17.143 --> 00:46:19.226
"it's Maria Gurdin,

1055
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.727
and you got it."

1056
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.060
- Mama, look at me now!
I'm a star!


1057
00:46:24.143 --> 00:46:25.894
Look!
Look how I live!


1058
00:46:25.977 --> 00:46:28.643
Look at my friends.
Look where I'm going.


1059
00:46:28.727 --> 00:46:30.268
I'm not staying in burlesque.

1060
00:46:30.351 --> 00:46:32.935
I'm moving,
maybe up, maybe down,


1061
00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:35.310
but wherever it is,
I'm enjoying it.


1062
00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:37.143
I'm having the time of my life

1063
00:46:37.226 --> 00:46:38.643
because for the first time,

1064
00:46:38.727 --> 00:46:41.268
it is my life,
and I love it.


1065
00:46:41.351 --> 00:46:42.810
I love every second of it,

1066
00:46:42.894 --> 00:46:45.602
and I'll be damned if you're
gonna take it away from me!


1067
00:46:45.685 --> 00:46:47.226
- Her mother was

1068
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:50.185
like a lot of mothers
of successful people.


1069
00:46:50.268 --> 00:46:51.935
She was determined

1070
00:46:52.019 --> 00:46:54.477
that her daughter
was going to be successful,


1071
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.935
I think,
and Natalie was.


1072
00:46:58.019 --> 00:47:02.101
- I think she once told me
that she didn't really decide


1073
00:47:02.185 --> 00:47:04.685
that that was
what she wanted to do


1074
00:47:04.769 --> 00:47:06.268
was be an actress

1075
00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:09.393
until Nick Ray
and "Rebel,"


1076
00:47:09.477 --> 00:47:11.101
and then it was clear to her

1077
00:47:11.185 --> 00:47:13.852
that she was not
just being pushed by her mother


1078
00:47:13.935 --> 00:47:15.393
any longer.
- Mm-hmm.


1079
00:47:16.852 --> 00:47:19.019
- He looks at me like

1080
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:22.643
I was the ugliest thing
in the world.


1081
00:47:22.727 --> 00:47:24.685
He doesn't like my friends.

1082
00:47:24.769 --> 00:47:27.769
He doesn't like one thing
about me.


1083
00:47:27.852 --> 00:47:32.101
And he called me...

1084
00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:35.477
he called me a dirty tramp!

1085
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.435
My own father!

1086
00:47:37.518 --> 00:47:40.643
- It was a very important film
for me personally


1087
00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:42.977
because up until then,
I had worked as a child,


1088
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.310
and I had always just done
as I was told.


1089
00:47:45.393 --> 00:47:46.935
I was--you know,
"You do this picture next,


1090
00:47:47.019 --> 00:47:48.268
and then you do
that picture next,"


1091
00:47:48.351 --> 00:47:50.810
and I was
a rather dutiful child.


1092
00:47:50.894 --> 00:47:54.019
And when my parents read
the script of "Rebel,"


1093
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:55.727
they said,
"Oh, no, not this one,"


1094
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.019
'cause this, you know,
showed parents


1095
00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:59.518
in a rather unsympathetic
light,


1096
00:47:59.602 --> 00:48:01.393
and yet I read it, and for
the first time in my life,


1097
00:48:01.477 --> 00:48:02.685
I said, "Oh, wait a minute.

1098
00:48:02.769 --> 00:48:04.935
I have to do this.
I love this."


1099
00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:07.019
You know, I love Judy,
and I felt


1100
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:10.226
very much of a connection,
identification with the part,


1101
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.894
and I guess I was going
through my first rebellion.


1102
00:48:12.977 --> 00:48:15.226
- My mom wanted to make
"Rebel Without a Cause"


1103
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.477
because she knew
that it was gonna take her


1104
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.226
away from these sort
of good little girl roles


1105
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.185
into leading lady roles,

1106
00:48:22.268 --> 00:48:25.351
and so she fought really hard
to get that part.


1107
00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:26.852
- When I was 15 years old

1108
00:48:26.935 --> 00:48:28.226
and doing
"Rebel Without a Cause,"


1109
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.685
at that time,

1110
00:48:29.769 --> 00:48:30.894
the director and the studios
and so forth


1111
00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:32.143
said I was too young,

1112
00:48:32.226 --> 00:48:33.351
even though I was
exactly the right age.


1113
00:48:33.435 --> 00:48:34.769
They were sort of testing
older girls,


1114
00:48:34.852 --> 00:48:38.060
and they also saw me
in pigtails with a pinafore,


1115
00:48:38.143 --> 00:48:39.393
because those were
the kind of parts


1116
00:48:39.477 --> 00:48:41.310
that I was associated with.

1117
00:48:41.393 --> 00:48:42.685
So I tested for it

1118
00:48:42.769 --> 00:48:44.226
a number of times,
as a matter of fact.


1119
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.560
Well, it's all right now.

1120
00:48:45.643 --> 00:48:47.685
You're our baby now.

1121
00:48:47.769 --> 00:48:49.852
I think I also got
into a car accident,


1122
00:48:49.935 --> 00:48:51.977
and instead of telling them
to call my parents,


1123
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.226
I told them to call
the director


1124
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.393
because one of the policemen

1125
00:48:54.477 --> 00:48:56.685
called me
a juvenile delinquent,


1126
00:48:56.769 --> 00:48:58.101
and I said, "Oh, well,
then that must mean


1127
00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:01.894
that I have the part."

1128
00:49:01.977 --> 00:49:04.101
"Call Nick Ray."

1129
00:49:04.185 --> 00:49:05.226
- There's sort of
a famous story


1130
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.310
where she went
to the Chateau Marmont


1131
00:49:07.393 --> 00:49:08.435
to get together
with Nicholas Ray,


1132
00:49:08.518 --> 00:49:10.060
the director
of "Rebel Without a Cause,"


1133
00:49:10.143 --> 00:49:12.727
and something intimate went on
with the two of them,


1134
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:13.935
a risky business back then.

1135
00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:16.393
She was underage,
and he was older,


1136
00:49:16.477 --> 00:49:17.935
right, so that would've been
a problem today.


1137
00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:20.560
- I met Nicholas Ray
a couple of times


1138
00:49:20.643 --> 00:49:22.894
even before
she was in "Rebel,"


1139
00:49:22.977 --> 00:49:26.894
and I knew when we went
to Nicholas Ray's apartment


1140
00:49:26.977 --> 00:49:29.101
that I never went upstairs.

1141
00:49:29.727 --> 00:49:32.060
And she would tell me
the next day or two


1142
00:49:32.143 --> 00:49:34.727
she just thought she was
in love with Nicholas Ray,


1143
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.977
and I said,
"Natalie, he's so old."


1144
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.935
She's, "Well, you know
I like older men."


1145
00:49:39.019 --> 00:49:40.602
I said, "But this
is really old."


1146
00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:43.101
- At no time did any
of the gentlemen


1147
00:49:43.185 --> 00:49:45.226
who were considered
your bosses--


1148
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.935
did they ever ask you
to do something


1149
00:49:47.019 --> 00:49:50.602
that might be considered
immoral?


1150
00:49:50.685 --> 00:49:52.226
- No.

1151
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.477
- Natalie is a product
of the studio system:


1152
00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.477
getting there on time
in the morning,


1153
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.143
working all day long,

1154
00:50:04.226 --> 00:50:06.852
knowing all of her lines
all the time.


1155
00:50:06.935 --> 00:50:09.268
That was the training
in that system,


1156
00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:13.019
and she came out of it
in such a good way.


1157
00:50:13.101 --> 00:50:14.518
Not everybody did,

1158
00:50:14.602 --> 00:50:15.977
because that system

1159
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.810
controlled everything
in your life.


1160
00:50:18.894 --> 00:50:21.310
You were just told
what pictures you're gonna do


1161
00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:24.185
and what time to report.

1162
00:50:24.268 --> 00:50:26.060
- She was owned by the studio,

1163
00:50:26.143 --> 00:50:27.643
and she didn't want
to be owned.


1164
00:50:27.727 --> 00:50:29.977
She wanted to have control
over the choices.


1165
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.727
I mean, if she's gonna spend
three months doing a film,


1166
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.477
she wants to believe in it,

1167
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.852
so she took on Jack Warner
and told him,


1168
00:50:36.935 --> 00:50:38.143
"I'm gonna go on strike

1169
00:50:38.226 --> 00:50:39.560
"because I don't like
the roles


1170
00:50:39.643 --> 00:50:41.852
that you're choosing for me."

1171
00:50:41.935 --> 00:50:44.518
- The suspension lasted
about 18 months,


1172
00:50:44.602 --> 00:50:46.560
so that--the punishment was

1173
00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.560
that if you wouldn't work
for them,


1174
00:50:48.643 --> 00:50:50.060
you couldn't work
anywhere else either.


1175
00:50:50.143 --> 00:50:51.226
- Right.
- It wasn't that I was


1176
00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.185
trying to get more money.

1177
00:50:52.268 --> 00:50:54.185
That really wasn't it at all.

1178
00:50:54.268 --> 00:50:56.852
But what I eventually did get
the right to do


1179
00:50:56.935 --> 00:51:00.852
was the right to choose
one picture a year


1180
00:51:00.935 --> 00:51:02.185
that, you know,
was my choice.


1181
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.727
The first one
that I was able to choose


1182
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.019
was "West Side Story."

1183
00:51:05.101 --> 00:51:07.393
Tonight is the real beginning
of my life


1184
00:51:07.477 --> 00:51:09.977
as a young lady of America.

1185
00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.852
- With "West Side Story,"
she became iconic,


1186
00:51:12.935 --> 00:51:14.393
a great legend.

1187
00:51:14.477 --> 00:51:17.477
I remember going
to train stations with Natalie


1188
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.477
or going to airports with her,

1189
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.727
and there--hundreds of people
would recognize her.


1190
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.435
- Madre de Dios,
I will do anything.


1191
00:51:25.518 --> 00:51:27.060
Make me die,

1192
00:51:27.143 --> 00:51:29.226
only please make it
to be true!


1193
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.560
- Today she would never
be cast in that role


1194
00:51:31.643 --> 00:51:33.351
because she's not
Puerto Rican.


1195
00:51:33.435 --> 00:51:34.769
That was obviously
a different time.


1196
00:51:34.852 --> 00:51:35.852
- It's sort of interesting

1197
00:51:35.935 --> 00:51:37.852
that Natalie Wood
would not have


1198
00:51:37.935 --> 00:51:41.727
one of her iconic roles today,
for sure.


1199
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.560
- You didn't get nominated
for an Academy Award


1200
00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:45.560
for "West Side Story,"

1201
00:51:45.643 --> 00:51:48.060
but there was
a particular reason why.


1202
00:51:48.143 --> 00:51:49.852
- Well, I was nominated
for "Splendor in the Grass."


1203
00:51:49.935 --> 00:51:51.727
- Right.

1204
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:54.310
- By the age of 25,
my mom had been nominated


1205
00:51:54.393 --> 00:51:55.477
for three Oscars.

1206
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.560
She was nominated
for Best Supporting Actress


1207
00:51:57.643 --> 00:51:59.185
for "Rebel Without a Cause,"

1208
00:51:59.268 --> 00:52:00.894
she was nominated
for Best Actress


1209
00:52:00.977 --> 00:52:02.268
for "Splendor in the Grass,"

1210
00:52:02.351 --> 00:52:03.769
and she was nominated
for Best Actress


1211
00:52:03.852 --> 00:52:05.894
for "Love with
the Proper Stranger."


1212
00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:08.268
Unfortunately,
she never won,


1213
00:52:08.351 --> 00:52:10.143
but I remember, in 1980,

1214
00:52:10.226 --> 00:52:11.268
my parents getting dressed up

1215
00:52:11.351 --> 00:52:13.101
to go
to the Golden Globe Awards,


1216
00:52:13.185 --> 00:52:14.268
and she won.

1217
00:52:14.351 --> 00:52:16.935
- Natalie Wood.

1218
00:52:17.019 --> 00:52:19.435
- She won a Golden Globe
for the television version


1219
00:52:19.518 --> 00:52:22.935
of "From Here to Eternity"
with William Devane.


1220
00:52:23.019 --> 00:52:25.019
- This really feels nice.

1221
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:27.268
Thank you very much.

1222
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.268
I'm completely surprised.

1223
00:52:29.351 --> 00:52:31.602
- She always had the ability

1224
00:52:31.685 --> 00:52:34.185
to recognize good material,

1225
00:52:34.268 --> 00:52:36.310
and when she did "Splendor"

1226
00:52:36.393 --> 00:52:39.643
and after "West Side Story"
was a tremendous hit,


1227
00:52:39.727 --> 00:52:41.602
she could start to make
her own decisions


1228
00:52:41.685 --> 00:52:43.060
on what she wanted to do

1229
00:52:43.143 --> 00:52:44.769
and what was available
for her.


1230
00:52:44.852 --> 00:52:46.310
She stepped out there
and took risks.


1231
00:52:46.393 --> 00:52:48.351
- I'm a female
past the age of consent.


1232
00:52:48.435 --> 00:52:50.977
I was the first woman to edit
the newspaper at my college.


1233
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.977
And I shall remain
handcuffed to this door


1234
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.351
until I become
the first female reporter


1235
00:52:55.435 --> 00:52:57.518
of the "New York Sentinel."
- Over my dead body.


1236
00:52:57.602 --> 00:52:59.310
- In "The Great Race,"

1237
00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:01.310
even though
it was a comedy,


1238
00:53:01.393 --> 00:53:03.602
she still was playing
a character


1239
00:53:03.685 --> 00:53:06.894
who was defending women,
believed in women,


1240
00:53:06.977 --> 00:53:08.518
but she found out
that she was not


1241
00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:11.351
being paid or treated equally

1242
00:53:11.435 --> 00:53:13.602
to Tony Curtis
and Jack Lemmon,


1243
00:53:13.685 --> 00:53:16.685
so she went to all kinds
of extremes


1244
00:53:16.769 --> 00:53:18.643
to make sure
that everything was equal,


1245
00:53:18.727 --> 00:53:20.435
down to the length

1246
00:53:20.518 --> 00:53:22.393
of the phone cord
in their rooms.


1247
00:53:22.477 --> 00:53:24.143
- And she was one
of the few women


1248
00:53:24.226 --> 00:53:27.226
that had the power
to do that at that time.


1249
00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.019
There weren't a lot of women
that did


1250
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.852
and who were outspoken enough

1251
00:53:30.935 --> 00:53:33.226
and could back it up
with her knowledge,


1252
00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.060
and everyone
who worked with her knew it.


1253
00:53:35.143 --> 00:53:36.518
They all learned from her.

1254
00:53:36.602 --> 00:53:37.643
- There's a picture of her

1255
00:53:37.727 --> 00:53:39.560
where she's
at the head of the table,


1256
00:53:39.643 --> 00:53:42.185
and then there's
her publicist, her agent,


1257
00:53:42.268 --> 00:53:43.518
her business manager.

1258
00:53:43.602 --> 00:53:45.019
They all work for her.

1259
00:53:45.101 --> 00:53:46.226
She's the only woman,

1260
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.935
and she's
at the head of the table.


1261
00:53:48.019 --> 00:53:50.643
And she wasn't afraid
to be empowered.


1262
00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:54.518
- I certainly owe
the beginning


1263
00:53:54.602 --> 00:53:56.226
of my career in film to her

1264
00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.060
'cause I was an actor
on Broadway in the theater,


1265
00:53:59.143 --> 00:54:01.560
and so she came to see
a play that I was in,


1266
00:54:01.643 --> 00:54:03.268
came backstage to say hello.

1267
00:54:03.351 --> 00:54:05.685
I was very flattered,
and then that was that.


1268
00:54:05.769 --> 00:54:07.518
Then a while later,
when they were getting her


1269
00:54:07.602 --> 00:54:10.226
to do "Inside Daisy Clover,"
my name came up,


1270
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:12.435
but I wasn't known at all
in Hollywood,


1271
00:54:12.518 --> 00:54:14.435
and she was the one

1272
00:54:14.518 --> 00:54:17.226
that stuck up for me
and said, "I want him."


1273
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.560
And there were a lot of people
that tried to resist that,


1274
00:54:19.643 --> 00:54:20.769
said,
"Well, he's just not known,


1275
00:54:20.852 --> 00:54:22.685
and you're a big star
and he's not," and so forth.


1276
00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:25.019
She--"I don't care.
I want to do it with him."


1277
00:54:25.101 --> 00:54:27.060
There was a young lady
named Cherry


1278
00:54:27.143 --> 00:54:30.477
who used to get swacked
on sweet sherry.


1279
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.727
And when they said--

1280
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:34.101
uh, when they said.

1281
00:54:34.185 --> 00:54:37.393
What--what...
what--what--help me!


1282
00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:39.393
- Um...
- When they said what?


1283
00:54:39.477 --> 00:54:40.810
- Um...
- Do you think


1284
00:54:40.894 --> 00:54:43.226
it's a sensible drink?

1285
00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.643
- That's good.

1286
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:47.852
She replied...

1287
00:54:51.643 --> 00:54:52.685
Not very.

1288
00:54:53.852 --> 00:54:56.477
So once that happened
and we made that film,


1289
00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.268
then we went into
"This Property Is Condemned,"


1290
00:54:58.351 --> 00:54:59.602
which she was desperate
to make.


1291
00:54:59.685 --> 00:55:02.435
She's, "Well, I'd like
to stay connected to Bob,"


1292
00:55:02.518 --> 00:55:04.435
so she just sort of
carried me along.


1293
00:55:04.518 --> 00:55:06.143
- Just because some people
might think I'm beautiful,


1294
00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:08.560
that doesn't mean
I'm everybody's property.


1295
00:55:08.643 --> 00:55:10.351
- If you really thought
you were beautiful,


1296
00:55:10.435 --> 00:55:11.643
you wouldn't be
anybody's property.


1297
00:55:11.727 --> 00:55:12.935
You'd be your own girl.

1298
00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:15.769
- I am my own girl,
Mr. Legate,


1299
00:55:15.852 --> 00:55:17.935
and I certainly don't need
some smart aleck like you


1300
00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:19.935
to come along and point out
the error of my ways.


1301
00:55:20.019 --> 00:55:22.560
- When I watch her films,
I straddle a fine line


1302
00:55:22.643 --> 00:55:25.477
between being caught
in her performance


1303
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.935
and then searching for clues
about who she was.


1304
00:55:30.019 --> 00:55:32.310
I think many of the movies
that my mom chose


1305
00:55:32.393 --> 00:55:36.060
had a cathartic aspect,
"Daisy Clover" especially.


1306
00:55:36.143 --> 00:55:37.810
The scene
in the recording booth


1307
00:55:37.894 --> 00:55:39.935
where she's supposed
to dub herself


1308
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:41.769
and we can't hear her
'cause we're outside


1309
00:55:41.852 --> 00:55:43.935
of the recording booth
but she's screaming...


1310
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.310
- That's how she felt
on the inside.


1311
00:55:47.393 --> 00:55:48.685
She was screaming
on the inside,


1312
00:55:48.769 --> 00:55:51.101
but nobody can hear her
because she was


1313
00:55:51.185 --> 00:55:53.935
owned by the studio.

1314
00:55:54.019 --> 00:55:55.643
- You have, in "Daisy Clover,"

1315
00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:57.643
the really brilliant
crack-up scene.


1316
00:55:57.727 --> 00:55:59.810
You have another one
in "Splendor in the Grass"


1317
00:55:59.894 --> 00:56:01.143
in the bathtub.

1318
00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:03.310
Those scenes must have been
difficult to do.


1319
00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.560
- I think they're
the kind of scenes


1320
00:56:05.643 --> 00:56:08.143
that one does just have to,
you know,


1321
00:56:08.226 --> 00:56:09.435
get into a certain mood,

1322
00:56:09.518 --> 00:56:11.810
and it's the kind of thing
that you can't do


1323
00:56:11.894 --> 00:56:13.727
very many times
over and over again.


1324
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.852
No, Mom!
I'm not spoiled!


1325
00:56:16.935 --> 00:56:19.351
I'm not spoiled, Mom!
- Deanie...


1326
00:56:19.435 --> 00:56:21.143
- I'm just as fresh
and I'm virginal


1327
00:56:21.226 --> 00:56:22.643
like the day I was born, Mom!

1328
00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:24.185
- Stop it!
Stop it!


1329
00:56:24.268 --> 00:56:26.518
- In the time that my mom
came of age,


1330
00:56:26.602 --> 00:56:29.351
nervous breakdowns
and mental institutions


1331
00:56:29.435 --> 00:56:31.101
and suicide,

1332
00:56:31.185 --> 00:56:33.226
that was more
of a taboo thing.


1333
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:35.351
There was a stigma
about all that stuff.


1334
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:36.393
- Deanie, come back here!

1335
00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:38.101
- And in
"Splendor in the Grass,"


1336
00:56:38.185 --> 00:56:40.685
she tries to commit suicide
in the water,


1337
00:56:40.769 --> 00:56:43.894
and then she goes
to a mental institution


1338
00:56:43.977 --> 00:56:45.435
for two years.

1339
00:56:45.518 --> 00:56:46.685
- She hasn't spoken
a word of sense


1340
00:56:46.769 --> 00:56:49.226
since they brought her
in here.


1341
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.019
- But in 1964,

1342
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:53.185
three years after "Splendor"
was released,


1343
00:56:53.268 --> 00:56:55.143
these themes
were actually reflected


1344
00:56:55.226 --> 00:56:57.019
in her real life.

1345
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:59.226
While she was filming
"The Great Race,"


1346
00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.685
she felt lonely and unhappy

1347
00:57:01.769 --> 00:57:04.560
and afraid of never being able
to maintain


1348
00:57:04.643 --> 00:57:07.226
a stable
and healthy relationship,


1349
00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.435
so she took
enough sleeping pills


1350
00:57:09.518 --> 00:57:11.101
to kill herself.

1351
00:57:11.185 --> 00:57:12.894
When I found out
about all this,


1352
00:57:12.977 --> 00:57:15.560
my Daddy Wagner
told me to talk to Mart


1353
00:57:15.643 --> 00:57:17.727
because he was spending
the night at her house


1354
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:18.935
when it happened.

1355
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.769
- It was an overdose
and a half.


1356
00:57:21.852 --> 00:57:24.226
I mean, God almighty,
she was out.


1357
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.560
And I was told that,

1358
00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:28.518
you know, after they pumped
her stomach, they didn't know


1359
00:57:28.602 --> 00:57:30.060
whether she was gonna
pull through or not,


1360
00:57:30.143 --> 00:57:31.769
but she did.

1361
00:57:31.852 --> 00:57:33.435
- She spent the weekend
in the hospital,


1362
00:57:33.518 --> 00:57:34.685
and on Monday morning,

1363
00:57:34.769 --> 00:57:36.560
she was back at work
on "The Great Race."


1364
00:57:36.643 --> 00:57:38.602
But I don't necessarily look
at that night


1365
00:57:38.685 --> 00:57:39.977
as a suicide attempt.

1366
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.435
It was really
a cry for help.


1367
00:57:42.518 --> 00:57:43.935
After she swallowed the pills,

1368
00:57:44.019 --> 00:57:45.894
she banged on Mart's door,

1369
00:57:45.977 --> 00:57:48.435
so obviously,
she wanted to live.


1370
00:57:48.518 --> 00:57:50.351
- I read that you were
in analysis--


1371
00:57:50.435 --> 00:57:51.602
I don't know
if this is correct or not--


1372
00:57:51.685 --> 00:57:53.477
eight year--for eight years,
five days a week,


1373
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.226
in Freudian analysis.
- Mm-hmm.


1374
00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:57.393
- You must have dry-cleaned
your mother and father,


1375
00:57:57.477 --> 00:57:58.935
I mean,
during that period of time.


1376
00:57:59.019 --> 00:58:00.977
- Well, I sorted out
a few problems.


1377
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.435
Dr. Judd,
don't they realize I'm me?


1378
00:58:04.518 --> 00:58:07.560
I don't think I could ever
go back home again.


1379
00:58:07.643 --> 00:58:10.101
I don't think I could ever
feel the same way


1380
00:58:10.185 --> 00:58:12.060
I used to feel about them.

1381
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:14.935
- We didn't talk a lot
about her childhood,


1382
00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:16.810
but I knew some things,

1383
00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:18.643
and she needed some help,

1384
00:58:18.727 --> 00:58:21.310
and she wasn't gonna get that
from her mom,


1385
00:58:21.393 --> 00:58:24.310
and it probably went
way back, undoubtedly,


1386
00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:25.351
all of it.

1387
00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:29.643
So with her own
significant intelligence


1388
00:58:29.727 --> 00:58:31.477
and a good therapist,

1389
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.268
she was able to make sense
of some pretty severe nonsense


1390
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:36.852
that had come and gone her way.

1391
00:58:36.935 --> 00:58:38.101
- How do you know?

1392
00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:39.643
- Because I've been
your analyst for three years.


1393
00:58:39.727 --> 00:58:40.685
I know what you're capable of,

1394
00:58:40.769 --> 00:58:41.977
and I know what you're not
capable of.


1395
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.060
- Would you like to bet?

1396
00:58:43.143 --> 00:58:44.477
- My reputation in psychiatry

1397
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.268
against anything you care
to put up.


1398
00:58:46.351 --> 00:58:47.518
- Will this be enough?

1399
00:58:47.602 --> 00:58:49.602
I feel I got a great deal
out of analysis,


1400
00:58:49.685 --> 00:58:51.643
and I think a lot of people
think that analysis


1401
00:58:51.727 --> 00:58:53.477
makes one become introspective,

1402
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.602
and I think it does
the opposite.


1403
00:58:54.685 --> 00:58:55.810
I think it opens you.

1404
00:58:55.894 --> 00:58:57.268
I think it frees you
from being


1405
00:58:57.351 --> 00:59:00.351
locked into your own--
worrying about yourself.


1406
00:59:00.435 --> 00:59:02.060
- One of
the most wonderful things


1407
00:59:02.143 --> 00:59:04.518
that she ever did for me was,
she convinced me


1408
00:59:04.602 --> 00:59:06.185
to get into analysis,

1409
00:59:06.268 --> 00:59:08.643
and it saved my life,
without question.


1410
00:59:08.727 --> 00:59:12.643
- I remember the day
that I saw Barbra Streisand


1411
00:59:12.727 --> 00:59:14.852
come to the set
to talk to Natalie


1412
00:59:14.935 --> 00:59:19.518
about how to block off time
to see your psychiatrist


1413
00:59:19.602 --> 00:59:21.769
during a movie,
'cause stars didn't have that


1414
00:59:21.852 --> 00:59:23.019
in their contracts
at that time,


1415
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:25.060
but she did.

1416
00:59:25.143 --> 00:59:27.143
There was nothing
out-of-bounds with Natalie.


1417
00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:29.685
I felt so comfortable with her.

1418
00:59:29.769 --> 00:59:32.810
- Here's a toast to Bob
and Carol and Ted and Alice.


1419
00:59:32.894 --> 00:59:34.643
- That's a good--
I'll drink to us.


1420
00:59:34.727 --> 00:59:35.810
- Hats and horns.
-  Four...


1421
00:59:35.894 --> 00:59:38.185
of the grooviest people
I've ever known.


1422
00:59:38.268 --> 00:59:40.143
- This movie
was about infidelity


1423
00:59:40.226 --> 00:59:41.435
and these encounter groups

1424
00:59:41.518 --> 00:59:44.060
where people were looking
into their real me


1425
00:59:44.143 --> 00:59:47.560
and all the things that were
spanking new at the time


1426
00:59:47.643 --> 00:59:49.226
and very controversial.

1427
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.060
- It just seems wrong.

1428
00:59:51.143 --> 00:59:52.351
- Oh, it's not.

1429
00:59:52.435 --> 00:59:54.060
Look, it's just nice feelings.

1430
00:59:54.143 --> 00:59:56.060
It's something that we've
never done before.


1431
00:59:56.143 --> 00:59:59.393
It's physical fun.
It's just sex.


1432
00:59:59.477 --> 01:00:01.727
- I was not sure of it.

1433
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.643
I thought
it might be exploitative


1434
01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:06.685
in terms of the sexual aspect
of it,


1435
01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:10.226
but Natalie brought
what the film needed:


1436
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.935
not only a star

1437
01:00:12.019 --> 01:00:15.351
but a quality of intelligence

1438
01:00:15.435 --> 01:00:18.769
that an audience
could identify with.


1439
01:00:18.852 --> 01:00:21.060
And even the scene

1440
01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:23.518
when we're all
in bed together,


1441
01:00:23.602 --> 01:00:26.143
I wore two pairs
of jockey shorts,


1442
01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:30.143
but Natalie made it
so easy


1443
01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.602
and so natural.

1444
01:00:31.685 --> 01:00:35.060
So that was a great gift
for all of us.


1445
01:00:35.143 --> 01:00:38.518
- In 1970, she had just
come off a big success


1446
01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:40.310
with "Bob & Carol
& Ted & Alice."


1447
01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:43.643
My Daddy Gregson called her
"rich and happy"


1448
01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:46.101
because she owned points
in that film,


1449
01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:48.602
and so I think she was
in a really good place


1450
01:00:48.685 --> 01:00:50.310
at that time.

1451
01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:56.769
- At one point,
you had unbelievable power


1452
01:00:56.852 --> 01:00:58.143
for a female

1453
01:00:58.226 --> 01:01:00.101
when you were
one of the few females


1454
01:01:00.185 --> 01:01:02.226
who could get a picture made,

1455
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:05.935
and then you seemed
to opt out of stardom.


1456
01:01:06.019 --> 01:01:07.477
Why?

1457
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.810
- Oh, gosh, Rona,
I don't know.


1458
01:01:09.894 --> 01:01:12.977
I've been acting
since I was five, really,


1459
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.310
and I think that I came
to a point in my life


1460
01:01:16.393 --> 01:01:18.935
where I felt that I wanted
to live some of my life


1461
01:01:19.019 --> 01:01:20.101
without work,

1462
01:01:20.185 --> 01:01:23.185
because I'd always been
so absorbed in work.


1463
01:01:23.268 --> 01:01:26.435
And I also got married
and wanted to have children,


1464
01:01:26.518 --> 01:01:29.810
and I really just enjoyed
being with them.


1465
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.143
- After I was born in 1970,

1466
01:01:41.226 --> 01:01:43.060
my mom took a break
from acting


1467
01:01:43.143 --> 01:01:45.477
for maybe four or five years

1468
01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.560
because she wanted to be
a stay-at-home mom.


1469
01:01:48.643 --> 01:01:49.685
And then slowly, you know,

1470
01:01:49.769 --> 01:01:52.393
the acting bug
came back around,


1471
01:01:52.477 --> 01:01:55.393
and so she did start to feel
the need to go back to work.


1472
01:01:55.477 --> 01:01:56.518
- May I come in?

1473
01:01:56.602 --> 01:01:58.060
- Why the hell not?

1474
01:01:58.143 --> 01:01:59.351
Better late than never.

1475
01:01:59.435 --> 01:02:01.810
- And then when Courtney
and I were getting older,


1476
01:02:01.894 --> 01:02:03.185
she wanted to act

1477
01:02:03.268 --> 01:02:05.852
with the knowledge
of being a mother.


1478
01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:07.143
- All right.

1479
01:02:07.226 --> 01:02:09.310
That's little Cassie,
always obedient.


1480
01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.019
Kiss your mother.
Go to confession.


1481
01:02:11.101 --> 01:02:12.727
Change the baby.
Shut your mouth.


1482
01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.727
- "The Cracker Factory"
was a big television event


1483
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.268
of that time,

1484
01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:21.226
and it was very unusual
that a big movie star


1485
01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:24.351
was going to portray
a character on television


1486
01:02:24.435 --> 01:02:26.518
that had so many flaws.

1487
01:02:26.602 --> 01:02:28.310
And I played her daughter,

1488
01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:30.268
and I remember her
being excited


1489
01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:33.185
about playing real struggles
of people's families


1490
01:02:33.268 --> 01:02:34.769
and about being real.

1491
01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:37.060
- It was a book that I just
thought was wonderful,


1492
01:02:37.143 --> 01:02:38.935
and I thought
what made it unusual


1493
01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:40.393
is the woman's real wit

1494
01:02:40.477 --> 01:02:41.977
and her way of dealing

1495
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.019
with the problems
that she had.


1496
01:02:44.101 --> 01:02:46.143
And I think it wasn't only
about alcoholism.


1497
01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:48.560
I think it was also
about the many pressures


1498
01:02:48.643 --> 01:02:53.060
that face a woman,
wife, mother today.


1499
01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:57.393
- I would hear discussions
with Natalie and RJ


1500
01:02:57.477 --> 01:02:58.518
'cause here they are
in the bed,


1501
01:02:58.602 --> 01:02:59.894
and I'm over here at the desk.

1502
01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:02.894
RJ was doing "Hart to Hart,"

1503
01:03:02.977 --> 01:03:04.727
and Natalie would say,
"Well, I've got the script,


1504
01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:07.185
'Meteor' with Sean Connery."

1505
01:03:07.268 --> 01:03:09.810
And he'd say, "Well, okay,
I have a break


1506
01:03:09.894 --> 01:03:13.393
during this time,"
because their main rule was,


1507
01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:15.310
they wouldn't both
be working at the same time,


1508
01:03:15.393 --> 01:03:17.310
that somebody would be home
for the children.


1509
01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.101
- It doesn't look like
you're ready to jump rope.


1510
01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:20.602
- Well, I think
I'm gonna watch,


1511
01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:22.477
and I'll let the Harts
jump rope today.


1512
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.643
But we do jump rope at home,

1513
01:03:23.727 --> 01:03:24.769
and the kids
are gonna jump rope,


1514
01:03:24.852 --> 01:03:26.602
Courtney, Natasha, Katie.

1515
01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:28.268
- I love jump rope.

1516
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:30.393
- Why?
- Because.


1517
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:32.185
- Does it make you feel good?
- Yes.


1518
01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:33.560
- Do you recommend it?

1519
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.060
- I don't know.

1520
01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:38.310
- I think women today
are trying to have it all


1521
01:03:38.393 --> 01:03:41.143
in the sense
that we don't just choose


1522
01:03:41.226 --> 01:03:43.060
to be one thing
or the other.


1523
01:03:43.143 --> 01:03:45.643
We don't just say, "Well,
now we're gonna give up career,


1524
01:03:45.727 --> 01:03:48.560
"sacrifice our life,
and be a wife and a mother,


1525
01:03:48.643 --> 01:03:51.143
or we're gonna be
a career woman, pursue that."


1526
01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:55.518
I mean, I think a lot of us
are trying to do


1527
01:03:55.602 --> 01:03:56.977
all of it, you know,

1528
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.143
without having, you know,
one suffer.


1529
01:04:00.226 --> 01:04:02.143
- I think it was difficult
for her.


1530
01:04:02.226 --> 01:04:05.143
She was torn by wanting

1531
01:04:05.226 --> 01:04:07.977
to be there
with her children


1532
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.393
in a family unit with RJ

1533
01:04:10.477 --> 01:04:12.935
and to fulfill
this other side of her


1534
01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:14.143
that was her core,

1535
01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:17.769
and I think that was
a real growing pressure.


1536
01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:19.143
- Marker.

1537
01:04:19.226 --> 01:04:21.060
- With your children
growing up,


1538
01:04:21.143 --> 01:04:24.643
with your going back
into doing more movies,


1539
01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:28.477
how would you like to see
your 40th birthday approached?


1540
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.060
- Oh, gosh.

1541
01:04:30.143 --> 01:04:32.435
Well, I would like to...work.

1542
01:04:32.518 --> 01:04:33.852
I would like to keep working,

1543
01:04:33.935 --> 01:04:36.310
not necessarily
at a faster speed,


1544
01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:38.185
but I'd like to be able
to do good parts.


1545
01:04:38.268 --> 01:04:39.852
I loved working
in "West Side Story,"


1546
01:04:39.935 --> 01:04:41.101
but I wouldn't go back.

1547
01:04:41.185 --> 01:04:42.226
Today's what counts,

1548
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:44.268
and RainTree helps you
make the most of it.


1549
01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:46.560
- She was going through
a transition in age,


1550
01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:49.518
which Hollywood was not
very accepting of,


1551
01:04:49.602 --> 01:04:52.685
and even now, it's a problem
once you get those crow's-feet,


1552
01:04:52.769 --> 01:04:53.685
you know?

1553
01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.185
Maybe you don't get
the great roles.


1554
01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:57.852
- If you're like me, you don't
want to go back in time.


1555
01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.894
You want to stay ahead of it.

1556
01:04:59.977 --> 01:05:01.727
- But she was unsinkable.

1557
01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:04.019
She would accept that,
"Yes, I'm now 40,"


1558
01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.810
which seems like nothing now,

1559
01:05:05.894 --> 01:05:06.852
"and I'm gonna work,
and I'm gonna be


1560
01:05:06.935 --> 01:05:09.643
a woman my age,
and it's gonna be great."


1561
01:05:09.727 --> 01:05:13.019
- Come on, now.
Stop holding things back.


1562
01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:14.643
- All right, God damn it.

1563
01:05:14.727 --> 01:05:16.393
I'm not sorry
they're getting divorced.


1564
01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:18.560
I mean, I am sorry
they're getting divorced.


1565
01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:22.560
- She had, like,
two personalities,


1566
01:05:22.643 --> 01:05:24.560
both of which
she controlled,


1567
01:05:24.643 --> 01:05:27.226
but when she chose
to be a movie star,


1568
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.685
she was all made up.

1569
01:05:29.769 --> 01:05:31.477
- And, honey...
- Yeah.


1570
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.602
- While you're finishing
your hot dog,


1571
01:05:33.685 --> 01:05:35.101
think of this.

1572
01:05:35.185 --> 01:05:38.101
I'm not wearing anything
underneath my coat.


1573
01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:40.435
- You're kidding.

1574
01:05:42.435 --> 01:05:44.894
So she was very wise

1575
01:05:44.977 --> 01:05:47.935
about how she dispensed
herself,


1576
01:05:48.019 --> 01:05:49.935
the commercial side of her.

1577
01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:52.185
- My mom had
a great publicist


1578
01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:54.602
named George Kirvey,
and he felt,


1579
01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.977
when she was hitting
her 40s,


1580
01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.101
that it was time
to revamp her image.


1581
01:05:59.185 --> 01:06:00.977
- I was working
for "Look" magazine


1582
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.435
and "People" magazine,

1583
01:06:03.518 --> 01:06:05.435
and George Kirvey said,

1584
01:06:05.518 --> 01:06:09.477
"Maybe, you know, we want
to change Natalie's image


1585
01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.852
"to some more sensual,
maybe a little sexier,


1586
01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:16.560
and more of the '70s time,"
and we did that,


1587
01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.226
and we
really accomplished that.


1588
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:19.935
It's been written about:
I changed


1589
01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:23.019
the whole professional look
of Natalie Wood.


1590
01:06:24.226 --> 01:06:29.060
This is my favorite photo
of Natalie Wood.


1591
01:06:29.143 --> 01:06:32.643
This is published
all around the world.


1592
01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:36.268
And this is the "Anastasia"
poster portrait


1593
01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:39.185
that we did for--
you hold it up--


1594
01:06:39.268 --> 01:06:41.185
for the Ahmanson Theatre.

1595
01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:45.185
- It was an exciting time
for her professionally.


1596
01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.226
I remember
having conversations


1597
01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.769
with her and George

1598
01:06:48.852 --> 01:06:51.977
about her first
stage appearance


1599
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.351
in "Anastasia."

1600
01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:55.602
She was petrified
of the stage


1601
01:06:55.685 --> 01:06:58.143
but wanted to overcome it.

1602
01:06:58.226 --> 01:06:59.477
- During that time that Mommy

1603
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.602
was thinking
about "Anastasia,"


1604
01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.435
you were working really hard.

1605
01:07:03.518 --> 01:07:04.810
- Well, we were still doing
"Hart to Hart."


1606
01:07:04.894 --> 01:07:06.351
- You were doing
"Hart to Hart."


1607
01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:08.435
- I was in Hawaii,
you know, on location


1608
01:07:08.518 --> 01:07:09.810
when she was doing
"Brainstorm"


1609
01:07:09.894 --> 01:07:11.810
in North Carolina.

1610
01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:14.518
- In 1981, when my mom
passed away,


1611
01:07:14.602 --> 01:07:17.435
she was in the middle
of filming "Brainstorm,"


1612
01:07:17.518 --> 01:07:20.518
starring Christopher Walken
and Louise Fletcher.


1613
01:07:20.602 --> 01:07:22.894
She was shooting on location
in North Carolina,


1614
01:07:22.977 --> 01:07:24.393
and it was kind of a big deal

1615
01:07:24.477 --> 01:07:27.351
because that was
the first time that my mom


1616
01:07:27.435 --> 01:07:28.351
and my Daddy Wagner

1617
01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:29.977
would be working
at the same time.


1618
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.019
- I think I can get it
down to size


1619
01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:33.685
and make it look attractive,

1620
01:07:33.769 --> 01:07:37.560
maybe something
like stereo headphones.


1621
01:07:37.643 --> 01:07:39.643
- I'm not worried about that.
I know you can.


1622
01:07:39.727 --> 01:07:42.351
It's Michael.

1623
01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:45.351
You're gonna have to work
very closely with him.


1624
01:07:45.435 --> 01:07:46.810
Is that a problem?

1625
01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:48.518
- No.

1626
01:07:48.602 --> 01:07:50.185
That won't be any problem.

1627
01:07:50.268 --> 01:07:52.060
- Okay.
- Not for me.


1628
01:07:52.143 --> 01:07:54.351
- At first,
I was very intimidated


1629
01:07:54.435 --> 01:07:55.894
with the idea of working
with Natalie Wood.


1630
01:07:55.977 --> 01:07:57.685
This is
an extremely experienced


1631
01:07:57.769 --> 01:07:59.560
and competent actress,

1632
01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:03.268
and Chris Walken is kind of
an experimental performer,


1633
01:08:03.351 --> 01:08:05.143
and he's so extraordinary.

1634
01:08:05.226 --> 01:08:06.727
So I never felt any problem

1635
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.351
with trying to make them
fit together as a couple.


1636
01:08:09.435 --> 01:08:10.560
From a director's standpoint,

1637
01:08:10.643 --> 01:08:12.101
I thought
it was gonna work fine.


1638
01:08:12.185 --> 01:08:14.935
But one of the things
that I wanted to comment on


1639
01:08:15.019 --> 01:08:16.685
in the context
of this interview


1640
01:08:16.769 --> 01:08:19.060
is that there was a love scene
between the two,


1641
01:08:19.143 --> 01:08:20.518
a sex scene, actually,

1642
01:08:20.602 --> 01:08:22.894
and I found out
in the shooting of that scene


1643
01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:25.560
that there was
almost no physical charisma


1644
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.019
between them at all,

1645
01:08:27.101 --> 01:08:29.894
and so that made me believe,
in retrospect now,


1646
01:08:29.977 --> 01:08:31.769
that the suggestion that there
was some love triangle


1647
01:08:31.852 --> 01:08:34.560
between Natalie and Christopher
and RJ or something like that,


1648
01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:36.060
whatever anybody
would make of it,


1649
01:08:36.143 --> 01:08:37.226
is not true.

1650
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:38.643
I just think
it's impossible.


1651
01:08:38.727 --> 01:08:41.351
- Based on conversations
I had with Natalie,


1652
01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:43.560
she was not having an affair.

1653
01:08:43.643 --> 01:08:46.019
That's based on what
she was saying to me.


1654
01:08:47.685 --> 01:08:49.852
That's what I believe.

1655
01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.393
- How do you and your wife
manage to combine


1656
01:08:52.477 --> 01:08:55.810
two successful careers
and a good family life?


1657
01:08:55.894 --> 01:08:57.685
- She's
a really wonderful lady,


1658
01:08:57.769 --> 01:09:00.143
and she rather makes it all
work out.


1659
01:09:00.226 --> 01:09:02.602
You know, she really--
it's a very difficult thing


1660
01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:03.977
to be a mother and an actress

1661
01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.810
and have a career
and have a husband


1662
01:09:05.894 --> 01:09:07.393
and all of that.

1663
01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.435
It's difficult
because we haven't really


1664
01:09:09.518 --> 01:09:10.935
ever been apart this long.

1665
01:09:11.019 --> 01:09:12.435
This is the longest
we've been apart,


1666
01:09:12.518 --> 01:09:15.852
and it has been--I find it
very difficult, really,


1667
01:09:15.935 --> 01:09:18.101
because, you know,
we've been together so much,


1668
01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:21.060
and I think it's difficult
for anybody who's in love


1669
01:09:21.143 --> 01:09:23.268
to be...away from the one--

1670
01:09:23.351 --> 01:09:24.810
the person that they're
in love with.


1671
01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.685
- I think it really is
a question


1672
01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:28.185
of trying to figure out
how to use your time


1673
01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:29.310
the best way...
- Mm-hmm.


1674
01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:30.477
- And to be flexible.

1675
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.810
Because I think the main thing

1676
01:09:31.894 --> 01:09:33.769
is to try to be together
as much as possible


1677
01:09:33.852 --> 01:09:35.393
so that everybody--you know,

1678
01:09:35.477 --> 01:09:36.560
so that you're
with your kids enough


1679
01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:39.810
and with your husband enough
and with yourself enough


1680
01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:43.143
and doing
your own thing enough.


1681
01:09:43.226 --> 01:09:44.810
- When she went
to North Carolina,


1682
01:09:44.894 --> 01:09:47.101
I remember that I would
write her these letters,


1683
01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:49.518
and I would cry
as I was writing the letter


1684
01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:50.685
'cause I missed her so much,

1685
01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:54.019
and then I would draw
around the tear,


1686
01:09:54.101 --> 01:09:56.268
and then I would write "tear"
with an arrow...


1687
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:57.977
Because obviously,

1688
01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.477
she couldn't see the tear
'cause it had dried up.


1689
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.101
- Yeah, you did miss her a lot.
- Yeah.


1690
01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:04.268
I really missed her,
and I wasn't used


1691
01:10:04.351 --> 01:10:05.977
to her being gone,

1692
01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:09.185
so when she came back,

1693
01:10:09.268 --> 01:10:11.852
we were all really happy
to see her.


1694
01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:13.685
- We had wrapped
in North Carolina.


1695
01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:15.894
We were done
with the location shooting,


1696
01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:17.310
and we were going back to LA

1697
01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:20.060
to shoot the interiors
and set stuff back at MGMs


1698
01:10:20.143 --> 01:10:21.643
after the Thanksgiving
holiday.


1699
01:10:21.727 --> 01:10:24.185
- In 1981, we had Thanksgiving
together as a family


1700
01:10:24.268 --> 01:10:25.894
at the house on Cañon Drive.

1701
01:10:25.977 --> 01:10:28.393
A house full of people,
as always.


1702
01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:30.685
Natalie had returned
from North Carolina


1703
01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:32.727
to finish shooting
"Brainstorm" in Los Angeles,


1704
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.060
and Daddy had come back
from Hawaii,


1705
01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:37.226
where he had been shooting
"Hart to Hart,"


1706
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.977
and it was very rainy
and stormy that weekend.


1707
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.685
Natalie and Daddy
would go out on the boat


1708
01:10:41.769 --> 01:10:42.685
a lot for weekends.

1709
01:10:42.769 --> 01:10:44.019
A lot of times,
the kids would go,


1710
01:10:44.101 --> 01:10:46.185
but in this case, they were
gonna have an adult weekend,


1711
01:10:46.268 --> 01:10:48.560
and I know that Natalie
had asked several people


1712
01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:49.727
to join them.

1713
01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.268
Christopher Walken
was in Los Angeles


1714
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:52.393
to finish "Brainstorm."

1715
01:10:52.477 --> 01:10:54.019
He did not live
in Los Angeles.


1716
01:10:54.101 --> 01:10:55.560
And so naturally,
she asked him


1717
01:10:55.643 --> 01:10:56.727
to go on the boat.

1718
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.226
And they asked
several other friends


1719
01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:00.351
that just didn't feel
comfortable


1720
01:11:00.435 --> 01:11:02.101
and didn't want to go.

1721
01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:05.894
- It's pouring with rain
the entire Thanksgiving.


1722
01:11:05.977 --> 01:11:08.019
We all were at dinner.

1723
01:11:08.101 --> 01:11:10.894
And I thought,
"Well, this is absurd."


1724
01:11:10.977 --> 01:11:12.435
I mean, besides trying
to get out of it


1725
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:14.435
because, you know, it was clear

1726
01:11:14.518 --> 01:11:18.518
that RJ and Chris
were arguing all the time,


1727
01:11:18.602 --> 01:11:20.143
I didn't want
any part of it.


1728
01:11:20.226 --> 01:11:24.019
- I remember feeling that
it was a little bit tense,


1729
01:11:24.101 --> 01:11:27.518
and I remember staying later
with her


1730
01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:29.060
to see if she was okay

1731
01:11:29.143 --> 01:11:31.602
after we'd all had dinner,

1732
01:11:31.685 --> 01:11:33.935
and she told me
that she was


1733
01:11:34.019 --> 01:11:35.810
and that she'd been
under a lot of pressure


1734
01:11:35.894 --> 01:11:37.268
in the movie

1735
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:39.894
and would I please come
on the boat,


1736
01:11:39.977 --> 01:11:41.935
but it was my son's birthday,

1737
01:11:42.019 --> 01:11:43.268
so I said to Natalie,

1738
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:44.477
"I'm not gonna come
on the boat,


1739
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.769
so we'll all have dinner
on the Sunday night,"


1740
01:11:47.852 --> 01:11:50.143
and that was the last time
I saw her.


1741
01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.727
- We sat up until all hours
of the night


1742
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.685
on the last night, talking,

1743
01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:57.769
and she was anxious
about going on the boat


1744
01:11:57.852 --> 01:12:01.685
because she felt compromised.

1745
01:12:01.769 --> 01:12:04.602
She loved the life she had,

1746
01:12:04.685 --> 01:12:06.727
and she loved the work,

1747
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.518
and she knew
she couldn't do both fully,


1748
01:12:09.602 --> 01:12:12.518
and these two men
actually represented


1749
01:12:12.602 --> 01:12:14.101
both sides of that argument.

1750
01:12:14.185 --> 01:12:16.226
You know, Chris was--
in her mind,


1751
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:18.477
he was a free spirit,
an artist,


1752
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.268
and RJ was a responsible
husband and father.


1753
01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:25.143
And I said to her
that I thought it was


1754
01:12:25.226 --> 01:12:26.894
important that she go
on the boat,


1755
01:12:26.977 --> 01:12:28.310
that it would give her
an opportunity


1756
01:12:28.393 --> 01:12:29.643
to work through all of this,

1757
01:12:29.727 --> 01:12:33.643
and...silly me.

1758
01:12:33.727 --> 01:12:38.643
- I've never forgiven myself
for not going,


1759
01:12:38.727 --> 01:12:40.101
because I'm sure
there would've been


1760
01:12:40.185 --> 01:12:43.185
a different dynamic somewhere.

1761
01:12:43.268 --> 01:12:45.852
- The last time
I saw my mom


1762
01:12:45.935 --> 01:12:48.310
was the day
after Thanksgiving


1763
01:12:48.393 --> 01:12:50.477
at our house
on Cañon Drive.


1764
01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.143
It was raining outside,

1765
01:12:52.226 --> 01:12:55.060
and I didn't want them
to go on the boat,


1766
01:12:55.143 --> 01:12:56.685
so I was hugging her,
and I was telling her,


1767
01:12:56.769 --> 01:12:58.894
"I love you, and I don't want
you to go on the boat,"


1768
01:12:58.977 --> 01:13:02.019
and she was comforting me
and telling me not to worry


1769
01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:03.727
and that everything
would be okay.


1770
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:07.477
So a few hours later,
my parents left on the boat


1771
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.602
for Catalina
with Christopher Walken,


1772
01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.560
who I didn't know very well,

1773
01:13:11.643 --> 01:13:13.685
and Dennis Davern,
who my parents hired


1774
01:13:13.769 --> 01:13:16.019
to take care
of the "Splendour."


1775
01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:18.810
- She'd called me
from Catalina,


1776
01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.685
and she left two messages
on my machine


1777
01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:23.727
saying, had I heard from RJ?

1778
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.185
She and RJ
had had an argument


1779
01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:26.477
the night before.

1780
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.019
The second was,
she had called back


1781
01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:30.477
to say everything was fine,
not to worry.


1782
01:13:31.435 --> 01:13:33.685
- On the first night,
Mommy had gone


1783
01:13:33.769 --> 01:13:36.935
onto Catalina Island
and stayed in a hotel,


1784
01:13:37.019 --> 01:13:38.060
right?
- In Avalon.


1785
01:13:38.143 --> 01:13:39.185
- In Avalon, right.
- Yeah.


1786
01:13:39.268 --> 01:13:41.351
And the reason for that
was because


1787
01:13:41.435 --> 01:13:44.560
we couldn't pick up a mooring
inside the harbor,


1788
01:13:44.643 --> 01:13:47.602
so we dropped the anchor
outside on the breakwater,


1789
01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:49.935
and it was
a very rough night,


1790
01:13:50.019 --> 01:13:52.727
and the boat was, you know,
just going up and down,


1791
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:53.894
up and down,

1792
01:13:53.977 --> 01:13:55.393
and it was
very uncomfortable.


1793
01:13:55.477 --> 01:13:57.560
- So you guys
were kind of arguing.


1794
01:13:57.643 --> 01:13:59.060
- Yes,
that got your mother


1795
01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.393
very nervous,
and so we decided


1796
01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:02.602
that she'd go ashore,

1797
01:14:02.685 --> 01:14:05.185
and Chris and I stayed
on board the boat


1798
01:14:05.268 --> 01:14:06.435
and just took watches
to see


1799
01:14:06.518 --> 01:14:07.560
that it was all right
and everything,


1800
01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.560
and then she came back
on board the next morning,


1801
01:14:09.643 --> 01:14:12.435
and we decided
to go from Avalon


1802
01:14:12.518 --> 01:14:14.185
down to the Isthmus,

1803
01:14:14.268 --> 01:14:16.518
and we were gonna
show Chris that anyway,


1804
01:14:16.602 --> 01:14:18.435
'cause that's where
we spent our honeymoon


1805
01:14:18.518 --> 01:14:20.019
and all of that.
- Mm-hmm.


1806
01:14:20.101 --> 01:14:22.393
- And when we were
at the Isthmus,


1807
01:14:22.477 --> 01:14:25.101
we tied up there,
and I went to sleep


1808
01:14:25.185 --> 01:14:26.643
'cause I was really tired.

1809
01:14:26.727 --> 01:14:28.143
- From the night before.
- From the night before.


1810
01:14:28.226 --> 01:14:30.477
- Uh-huh.
- And when I woke up,


1811
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.727
Chris and your mother
had gone to shore...


1812
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:35.602
- Mm-hmm.
- To this bar that was there.


1813
01:14:35.685 --> 01:14:37.560
I met them.
I got a shore boat.


1814
01:14:37.643 --> 01:14:38.894
And, you know,
they had these boats


1815
01:14:38.977 --> 01:14:41.435
that came up, picked you up,
and I went and met them,


1816
01:14:41.518 --> 01:14:44.143
and we had dinner,
which was pretty nice,


1817
01:14:44.226 --> 01:14:48.935
and I remember I had, you know,
a few glasses of vino,


1818
01:14:49.019 --> 01:14:53.477
and I was feeling
pretty good, and...


1819
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.769
we came back, you know,
to the boat.


1820
01:14:57.852 --> 01:14:59.935
I opened up
another bottle of wine


1821
01:15:00.019 --> 01:15:01.435
and had a couple more glasses
of wine,


1822
01:15:01.518 --> 01:15:05.477
and I sat there
with Chris, and...


1823
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.101
we started talking, and...

1824
01:15:08.185 --> 01:15:10.977
he started to mention to me
about your mother


1825
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.143
and how wonderful she was

1826
01:15:12.226 --> 01:15:13.977
and what a great actress
she was


1827
01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.643
and how he enjoyed
working with her,


1828
01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:17.602
and he said, "You know,
I think it's important


1829
01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:18.810
that she works,"
and I said,


1830
01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:20.935
"I think it's important
if you stay out of her life."


1831
01:15:21.019 --> 01:15:24.477
You know, I was
a little teed off about that.


1832
01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.477
Suddenly, he's telling me

1833
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.518
what she should do
and how she should behave.


1834
01:15:29.602 --> 01:15:31.268
I got angry at that.

1835
01:15:31.351 --> 01:15:33.310
And so your mother
went down below,


1836
01:15:33.393 --> 01:15:35.518
our stateroom,
where we st--


1837
01:15:35.602 --> 01:15:37.310
our bedroom was down below,

1838
01:15:37.393 --> 01:15:39.810
and she went down below
to get ready to go to bed,


1839
01:15:39.894 --> 01:15:42.185
and I sat there with Chris,
and I said,


1840
01:15:42.268 --> 01:15:43.435
"Why don't you just"--

1841
01:15:43.518 --> 01:15:45.060
you know,
"Don't tell her what to do


1842
01:15:45.143 --> 01:15:46.852
and, "Stay out of her life,"

1843
01:15:46.935 --> 01:15:49.685
and I picked up the bottle
and smashed it on the table,


1844
01:15:49.769 --> 01:15:53.351
and, you know, I was really,
you know...


1845
01:15:53.435 --> 01:15:57.019
angry at him about it,

1846
01:15:57.101 --> 01:16:00.226
and as I look back at it,
unjustifiably so,


1847
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.310
you know, but he ducked out,

1848
01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:06.143
went out, went up on the top

1849
01:16:06.226 --> 01:16:08.477
of the deck,

1850
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.685
and I followed him out there,

1851
01:16:10.769 --> 01:16:14.101
and I was still saying to him,
you know,


1852
01:16:14.185 --> 01:16:15.643
"Just stay out of it, Chris."

1853
01:16:15.727 --> 01:16:17.019
You know, "Don't get
involved in it.


1854
01:16:17.101 --> 01:16:18.310
It's important.
She's got three children."


1855
01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:19.643
Da-da--you know.
- Yeah.


1856
01:16:19.727 --> 01:16:23.435
- I mean, I was also a little
high at the time, I might say.


1857
01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:24.560
But I calmed down.

1858
01:16:24.643 --> 01:16:29.435
You know, I guess
me being out in the air and...


1859
01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.894
Anyway, I calmed down,

1860
01:16:31.977 --> 01:16:34.894
and we went back down below

1861
01:16:34.977 --> 01:16:37.019
and talked for a while.

1862
01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:38.477
- You and Chris?
- Yeah.


1863
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.894
- Uh-huh.
- And he went to his cabin,


1864
01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:43.727
which was up on the other part
of the--forward on the boat,


1865
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.310
and Dennis--

1866
01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:49.351
I had Dennis--you know,
we swept up the glass


1867
01:16:49.435 --> 01:16:53.560
off the floor
and cleaned up the salon a bit.


1868
01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:56.602
And we talked about leaving
the next day


1869
01:16:56.685 --> 01:16:58.518
to go back to the mainland,

1870
01:16:58.602 --> 01:17:01.393
and then I went below,
and when I went below,


1871
01:17:01.477 --> 01:17:03.393
she wasn't there,

1872
01:17:03.477 --> 01:17:05.977
and so I looked around.

1873
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.518
I looked in the bathroom,
and she wasn't in the bathroom,


1874
01:17:09.602 --> 01:17:12.560
and I went on the aft end
of the boat,


1875
01:17:12.643 --> 01:17:14.060
and the dinghy was gone,

1876
01:17:14.143 --> 01:17:15.435
and I came back up,
and I said--


1877
01:17:15.518 --> 01:17:17.602
I got Dennis and Chris.

1878
01:17:17.685 --> 01:17:18.810
I said, you know,
"Natalie's not here.


1879
01:17:18.894 --> 01:17:22.435
"She's...she's taken off,

1880
01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:23.769
"I guess, on the dinghy.

1881
01:17:23.852 --> 01:17:26.560
I better--did any of you
hear it?"


1882
01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.769
And we--n--see,
nobody heard anything.


1883
01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:29.935
- Right.
- I didn't hear anything.


1884
01:17:30.019 --> 01:17:31.226
I didn't hear
anything about--you know.


1885
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:33.727
We would have heard it if--
I believe,


1886
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.310
if the dinghy had fired up.

1887
01:17:35.393 --> 01:17:37.101
- Yes.

1888
01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:39.602
- So...

1889
01:17:39.685 --> 01:17:43.643
I...called a shore boat

1890
01:17:43.727 --> 01:17:45.310
when the guys come out,
'cause I thought


1891
01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:46.810
maybe she had gone back
to the restaurant


1892
01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:47.935
or back to the Isthmus,

1893
01:17:48.019 --> 01:17:49.143
where there were
these little slips


1894
01:17:49.226 --> 01:17:50.310
where you could put
your boat in and go in.


1895
01:17:50.393 --> 01:17:51.643
- I remember those.

1896
01:17:51.727 --> 01:17:53.477
- The dinghy wasn't there,
and she wasn't there,


1897
01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.769
and I yelled up,
and the guy says,


1898
01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:57.351
"Natalie up there?"
"No, she's not here."


1899
01:17:57.435 --> 01:18:00.268
I got back,
and the shore boat came back.


1900
01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:02.518
I said, "She's not--
she didn't go ashore,


1901
01:18:02.602 --> 01:18:04.310
at least to the Isthmus."
- Right.


1902
01:18:04.393 --> 01:18:07.435
- So it was then that we called
the shore patrol


1903
01:18:07.518 --> 01:18:09.101
and said, "Have you,
you know, seen anything?"


1904
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.977
"No, we haven't seen anything."

1905
01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.643
We called the coast guard.
The coast guard came in.


1906
01:18:12.727 --> 01:18:16.977
And then, you know,
we waited for a long--


1907
01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.310
God, it seemed like forever
to me, and...


1908
01:18:19.393 --> 01:18:20.643
- 'Cause they were looking
for her, right?


1909
01:18:20.727 --> 01:18:22.268
- Yeah, they were looking
for her,


1910
01:18:22.351 --> 01:18:23.477
and this man that I knew

1911
01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.143
and that your mother knew,
Doug Bombard,


1912
01:18:25.226 --> 01:18:28.019
he took care of everything
in Catalina at that time


1913
01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:31.727
and had all the moorings,
of which we had one,


1914
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:35.852
and he said, "We found her,"

1915
01:18:35.935 --> 01:18:39.351
and I said...

1916
01:18:39.435 --> 01:18:43.477
"Is she okay?"
and he said, "She's dead."


1917
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.185
And...

1918
01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:50.477
everything just went out
from under me.


1919
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.185
You know, just--it just--
everything just


1920
01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:57.977
went away from me, and...

1921
01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.810
we were all stunned,
everybody, and...


1922
01:19:05.185 --> 01:19:08.560
That night's gone
through my mind so many times,


1923
01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:12.560
you can imagine, and...

1924
01:19:12.643 --> 01:19:16.769
and I...

1925
01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.518
You know,
Chris was there with me.


1926
01:19:18.602 --> 01:19:23.852
He, by the way,
is a very stand-up guy


1927
01:19:23.935 --> 01:19:26.852
and a gentleman,
a true gentleman.


1928
01:19:26.935 --> 01:19:28.226
- I remember
that Mart told me


1929
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.769
that he picked you
and Chris Walken up


1930
01:19:30.852 --> 01:19:32.894
at the helicopter...
- Pad, yeah.


1931
01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:35.185
- And you drove to see
Arthur Malin...


1932
01:19:35.268 --> 01:19:36.685
- Mm-hmm.
- Your therapist,


1933
01:19:36.769 --> 01:19:38.185
because you needed
to talk to him


1934
01:19:38.268 --> 01:19:40.560
about how you were gonna
tell Courtney and I.


1935
01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:43.852
- He said to me...

1936
01:19:43.935 --> 01:19:46.143
"RJ," he said,
"I'll just tell you one thing.


1937
01:19:46.226 --> 01:19:47.560
"Don't minimize it.

1938
01:19:47.643 --> 01:19:52.268
Just tell them actually
how devastating it is."


1939
01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:53.935
And I remember,
I took you in my arms,


1940
01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:56.101
and, you know, you were
at the bottom of the stairs.


1941
01:19:56.185 --> 01:19:57.935
You remember?

1942
01:19:58.019 --> 01:20:02.602
And I said about your mother.

1943
01:20:02.685 --> 01:20:06.435
- And then we were
all together.


1944
01:20:06.518 --> 01:20:08.894
- And we've been
all together.


1945
01:20:08.977 --> 01:20:11.185
- Yeah.

1946
01:20:11.268 --> 01:20:12.602
- Thank God.

1947
01:20:12.685 --> 01:20:14.935
- Yeah.

1948
01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:16.935
- This afternoon,
Natalie Wood was buried


1949
01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.977
in a private ceremony
in Los Angeles,


1950
01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.602
attended only by family
and close friends.


1951
01:20:21.685 --> 01:20:25.268
- The funeral
was another media storm.


1952
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:28.268
They weren't allowed
into the cemetery,


1953
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:30.351
but they got ladders
to get up on the wall,


1954
01:20:30.435 --> 01:20:33.019
and it was not very pleasant,

1955
01:20:33.101 --> 01:20:35.643
considering we were trying
to pay our respects


1956
01:20:35.727 --> 01:20:37.810
and hold ourselves together.

1957
01:20:37.894 --> 01:20:40.019
- There was photographers
everywhere,


1958
01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.477
taking our picture,

1959
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.143
and I was thinking,
"How can they take my picture


1960
01:20:45.226 --> 01:20:49.894
"when I just said good-bye
to my mom?


1961
01:20:49.977 --> 01:20:51.769
It seems so wrong."

1962
01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:53.310
- I remember
your grandmother's


1963
01:20:53.393 --> 01:20:54.977
parting shot to me,

1964
01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.435
the last thing
that she ever said to me


1965
01:20:57.518 --> 01:20:58.769
at the funeral.

1966
01:20:58.852 --> 01:21:00.351
She came up to me and said,

1967
01:21:00.435 --> 01:21:02.185
"If you," meaning me,

1968
01:21:02.268 --> 01:21:05.810
"if you had been
on that boat,


1969
01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:09.351
my daughter would be alive."

1970
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.060
- The day after the funeral,

1971
01:21:16.143 --> 01:21:19.393
there was a big, bizarre,
hysterical party at the house.


1972
01:21:19.477 --> 01:21:21.810
RJ was in bed upstairs,

1973
01:21:21.894 --> 01:21:23.977
and there were
all these movie stars there.


1974
01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.019
It was really odd.
I mean, to me, it was odd.


1975
01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:29.685
It was like Madame Tussauds
brought to life, almost,


1976
01:21:29.769 --> 01:21:32.477
and Elizabeth Taylor was there
with the crystal ball,


1977
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.351
and Shirley MacLaine
was gonna heal RJ,


1978
01:21:35.435 --> 01:21:38.560
and it was just really
completely surreal atmosphere,


1979
01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:39.685
I thought.

1980
01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:42.019
- I definitely was trying
to be strong


1981
01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:46.019
because my Daddy Wagner
was so very fragile.


1982
01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:50.185
I was worried
that if I was too upset


1983
01:21:50.268 --> 01:21:52.560
that it would be
too much for him


1984
01:21:52.643 --> 01:21:55.226
and he would just drop dead.

1985
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.894
- He was really suffering,

1986
01:21:56.977 --> 01:21:59.852
and he didn't leave
the bed for days,


1987
01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:01.393
and then Willie Mae,

1988
01:22:01.477 --> 01:22:03.143
who was really part
of the family,


1989
01:22:03.226 --> 01:22:04.935
she came up to the bedroom,
and she said,


1990
01:22:05.019 --> 01:22:06.185
"RJ, you have to get up

1991
01:22:06.268 --> 01:22:07.435
"and get out of this bed
right now.


1992
01:22:07.518 --> 01:22:09.393
Your girls think
you're gonna die."


1993
01:22:09.477 --> 01:22:10.894
And that was that.

1994
01:22:10.977 --> 01:22:13.268
Thank God for Willie Mae,
you know?


1995
01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:14.769
- Well, I remember
Willie Mae,


1996
01:22:14.852 --> 01:22:16.727
she helped me get up,

1997
01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:19.727
and I pulled myself together,
and...


1998
01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:22.019
one foot went
in front of the other.


1999
01:22:22.101 --> 01:22:24.060
- Slowly.

2000
01:22:24.143 --> 01:22:26.393
- Very slowly.

2001
01:22:26.477 --> 01:22:28.894
- The press
didn't go away.


2002
01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:31.019
It was really horrible.

2003
01:22:31.101 --> 01:22:32.560
The children couldn't go out.

2004
01:22:32.643 --> 01:22:33.894
They could go
in the back garden,


2005
01:22:33.977 --> 01:22:35.852
but they certainly
couldn't go out the front,


2006
01:22:35.935 --> 01:22:40.143
and every friend that came up
to pay their respects,


2007
01:22:40.226 --> 01:22:41.769
click, click, click,
click, click.


2008
01:22:41.852 --> 01:22:44.810
- Most people can't imagine
what that's like,


2009
01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:47.060
to live in that kind
of a fishbowl,


2010
01:22:47.143 --> 01:22:49.560
and so RJ

2011
01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:52.393
didn't want to be at home
at Christmas.


2012
01:22:52.477 --> 01:22:55.101
- We then went away
for Christmas to Switzerland


2013
01:22:55.185 --> 01:22:56.935
to see his friend
David Niven


2014
01:22:57.019 --> 01:23:00.602
and be there and just get away
from the mania


2015
01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:01.602
that was going on
around the house


2016
01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:02.935
on Cañon Drive at the time.

2017
01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:04.310
- And RJ brought the kids,

2018
01:23:04.393 --> 01:23:06.268
encouraged by my father

2019
01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:07.602
to get out of town,

2020
01:23:07.685 --> 01:23:10.101
and found a chalet for RJ

2021
01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.310
not far
from my father's chalet.


2022
01:23:13.393 --> 01:23:16.935
- Soon after that,
my dad wanted us to go


2023
01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:20.268
to England to be
with Richard Gregson.


2024
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:23.602
- It was New Year's Eve,
just after the accident.


2025
01:23:23.685 --> 01:23:26.143
There were reporters
hanging off the trees,


2026
01:23:26.226 --> 01:23:27.977
and RJ was walking
around the garden


2027
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.143
with Richard in tears,

2028
01:23:30.226 --> 01:23:32.143
but at the same time,
we had a party.


2029
01:23:32.226 --> 01:23:34.852
You know, we had fun,
if that sounds odd.


2030
01:23:34.935 --> 01:23:36.477
- There was so much activity.

2031
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.310
When we were traveling
and stuff,


2032
01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:41.060
that seemed rather comforting
to me.


2033
01:23:41.143 --> 01:23:43.643
I think it was
finally coming back home


2034
01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.477
and, like,
going back to school,


2035
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.351
that didn't feel right.

2036
01:23:47.435 --> 01:23:49.351
- My parents had tried so hard
to give us


2037
01:23:49.435 --> 01:23:51.810
this very stabilized
and structured life,


2038
01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:55.810
and then when she died,
everything went upside down.


2039
01:23:55.894 --> 01:23:59.852
So I think it was a lot
of just surviving for a while.


2040
01:24:05.143 --> 01:24:08.393
- When I went to pay
the condolence call


2041
01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:10.143
to the Wagner house,

2042
01:24:10.226 --> 01:24:11.852
he was broken.

2043
01:24:11.935 --> 01:24:13.852
They were all broken.

2044
01:24:13.935 --> 01:24:16.852
And I had experienced loss
of my own.


2045
01:24:16.935 --> 01:24:20.185
I had lost my ex-husband
in a plane crash.


2046
01:24:20.268 --> 01:24:22.894
I knew what loss felt like.

2047
01:24:22.977 --> 01:24:26.310
- When Jill came into my life,
I was shattered.


2048
01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:29.019
I mean, I was totally empty,

2049
01:24:29.101 --> 01:24:32.019
and she had me by my elbow.

2050
01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:34.310
She was holding me up,

2051
01:24:34.393 --> 01:24:37.685
and I was a lot of weight.

2052
01:24:37.769 --> 01:24:39.685
- We did fall in love

2053
01:24:39.769 --> 01:24:42.727
but not exactly immediately.

2054
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:44.769
There was such pain

2055
01:24:44.852 --> 01:24:46.727
from such a loss,

2056
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.602
and it took time.

2057
01:24:48.685 --> 01:24:50.393
Fortunately for us,

2058
01:24:50.477 --> 01:24:52.727
it evolved into something
quite beautiful.


2059
01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:55.435
- You know, in the beginning,
when Daddy Wagner and Jill


2060
01:24:55.518 --> 01:24:56.727
started dating,

2061
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:58.727
I would express to him
at times


2062
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:00.769
that it was painful
and I didn't like it


2063
01:25:00.852 --> 01:25:03.185
and I didn't feel close
to Jill,


2064
01:25:03.268 --> 01:25:05.685
and she and I talked about it
in therapy.


2065
01:25:05.769 --> 01:25:09.894
I mean, it was definitely
a process.


2066
01:25:09.977 --> 01:25:12.935
- After my mom passed away
and even now,


2067
01:25:13.019 --> 01:25:15.060
I feel like I have
this ever-present echo


2068
01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:18.101
in my ear that just sounds
like it says...


2069
01:25:18.185 --> 01:25:20.101
"That's
Natalie Wood's daughter.


2070
01:25:20.185 --> 01:25:21.935
That's
Natalie Wood's daughter."


2071
01:25:22.019 --> 01:25:23.351
You know, and I just hear that,

2072
01:25:23.435 --> 01:25:24.810
and the only thing
I can think of


2073
01:25:24.894 --> 01:25:28.560
that I have to balance
that weird feeling


2074
01:25:28.643 --> 01:25:32.101
is my sister Natasha,
you know, and my sister Katie.


2075
01:25:32.185 --> 01:25:34.935
I just thank God
we had each other during that


2076
01:25:35.019 --> 01:25:36.435
and just in life anyway,

2077
01:25:36.518 --> 01:25:39.518
because I'm so, so close
with my sisters.


2078
01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:42.935
- Courtney was so young.
She was only seven.


2079
01:25:43.019 --> 01:25:45.101
To think that she lost her mom
at that age


2080
01:25:45.185 --> 01:25:46.977
is unimaginable,

2081
01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.769
and I think she wanted

2082
01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:51.268
to numb the pain,
she wanted to stop it,


2083
01:25:51.351 --> 01:25:53.435
so she struggled with drugs
and alcohol


2084
01:25:53.518 --> 01:25:55.268
for a really long time,

2085
01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:58.101
and there were times
when I absolutely thought


2086
01:25:58.185 --> 01:26:00.019
that I would lose my sister.

2087
01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:04.101
- When we as a family

2088
01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:06.643
addressed
Courtney's struggles,


2089
01:26:06.727 --> 01:26:10.310
we were all able to speak
from our hearts


2090
01:26:10.393 --> 01:26:12.810
things, perhaps,
we hadn't vocalized before


2091
01:26:12.894 --> 01:26:14.602
of how we felt,

2092
01:26:14.685 --> 01:26:18.143
and I believe it brought us
closer as a family.


2093
01:26:18.226 --> 01:26:21.310
- The main thing
that sobriety has brought me


2094
01:26:21.393 --> 01:26:24.518
is that that is
where I can have


2095
01:26:24.602 --> 01:26:26.310
total control of my life.

2096
01:26:26.393 --> 01:26:27.685
I thought that the other night.

2097
01:26:27.769 --> 01:26:29.101
I thought, "You know what?

2098
01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:30.643
"I'm in control of my life now,

2099
01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:33.643
and I don't have to worry
about anything."


2100
01:26:36.727 --> 01:26:39.810
- When my mom was alive,
she always said


2101
01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.477
that I wore my heart
on my sleeve,


2102
01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.477
and I did.

2103
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.769
But when she died,

2104
01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:49.560
I didn't have a safe place
anymore to be vulnerable,


2105
01:26:49.643 --> 01:26:52.894
so I armored myself
to the outside world


2106
01:26:52.977 --> 01:26:54.518
with, "I'm fine.
I'm okay.


2107
01:26:54.602 --> 01:26:56.185
"I don't need your pity.

2108
01:26:56.268 --> 01:26:58.393
I'm just fine,
thank you very much."


2109
01:26:58.477 --> 01:27:00.351
But after my mom died,

2110
01:27:00.435 --> 01:27:02.060
I found a lot of strength
and clarity


2111
01:27:02.143 --> 01:27:03.518
from being in therapy,

2112
01:27:03.602 --> 01:27:05.727
and I knew that I wanted
to have a child.


2113
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:08.268
That was really important,

2114
01:27:08.351 --> 01:27:09.518
and after my daughter
was born,


2115
01:27:09.602 --> 01:27:13.185
I was flooded
with so much happiness


2116
01:27:13.268 --> 01:27:14.518
and gratitude,

2117
01:27:14.602 --> 01:27:16.643
so I named my daughter Clover,

2118
01:27:16.727 --> 01:27:18.977
not necessarily
after the character


2119
01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.019
that my mom played,
Daisy Clover,


2120
01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:25.019
but mostly because clovers
are lucky


2121
01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:27.852
and I felt so lucky
to have her.


2122
01:27:27.935 --> 01:27:29.894
And having my daughter
has been


2123
01:27:29.977 --> 01:27:34.727
the most healing thing
for me.


2124
01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:36.101
- There's a development tonight

2125
01:27:36.185 --> 01:27:38.852
in one of Hollywood's
most enduring mysteries,


2126
01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:40.769
the death of Natalie Wood.

2127
01:27:40.852 --> 01:27:43.894
- What do we think
about, recently,


2128
01:27:43.977 --> 01:27:45.435
them reopening this case?

2129
01:27:45.518 --> 01:27:47.769
- Wood's death was ruled
an accidental drowning,


2130
01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:49.226
but in 2011,

2131
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.727
Los Angeles
sheriff's detectives


2132
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:51.727
reopened the case

2133
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.060
after Dennis Davern
coauthored a book


2134
01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:56.060
in which he gave
a very different account


2135
01:27:56.143 --> 01:27:57.310
of what happened that night.

2136
01:27:57.393 --> 01:28:00.268
- I believe that Robert Wagner
was with her


2137
01:28:00.351 --> 01:28:02.268
up until the moment
she went into the water.


2138
01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:03.435
- I mean, I know how I feel.

2139
01:28:03.518 --> 01:28:05.226
I feel like people just want

2140
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:07.894
to have some kind
of media storm.


2141
01:28:07.977 --> 01:28:10.060
- This new information
is substantial enough


2142
01:28:10.143 --> 01:28:11.935
for us to want to take
another look at the case.


2143
01:28:12.019 --> 01:28:14.810
- Is Robert Wagner a suspect?
- No.


2144
01:28:14.894 --> 01:28:18.143
- Oh, the--it's just
so transparent to me.


2145
01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.101
They can print anything
that they want to print today,


2146
01:28:20.185 --> 01:28:23.101
and, you know,
there was the coast guard.


2147
01:28:23.185 --> 01:28:24.810
There was the highway patrol,

2148
01:28:24.894 --> 01:28:26.435
the police department.

2149
01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:28.268
Everybody was on this.

2150
01:28:28.351 --> 01:28:30.435
- When it first happened, yes.
- When it first happened.


2151
01:28:30.518 --> 01:28:33.101
- Shortly after midnight

2152
01:28:33.185 --> 01:28:35.977
of the Sunday morning,

2153
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.101
she apparently attempted

2154
01:28:39.185 --> 01:28:43.393
to get onto the dinghy,

2155
01:28:43.477 --> 01:28:46.769
slipped,
and fell in the water,


2156
01:28:46.852 --> 01:28:51.268
unable to return
to the dinghy or the boat.


2157
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:54.518
- Noguchi said there was
no evidence of foul play.


2158
01:28:54.602 --> 01:28:55.977
He did indicate, however,

2159
01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.894
that tests revealed Ms. Wood
was technically drunk


2160
01:28:58.977 --> 01:29:01.143
but continually referred
to Wood's condition


2161
01:29:01.226 --> 01:29:02.977
as "slightly inebriated."

2162
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.310
He nevertheless admitted

2163
01:29:04.393 --> 01:29:06.268
that alcohol
might have been one reason


2164
01:29:06.351 --> 01:29:08.643
why the actress
was rendered unconscious.


2165
01:29:08.727 --> 01:29:12.435
- When the toxicology report
came out after Natalie drowned,


2166
01:29:12.518 --> 01:29:13.435
it was clear that there was

2167
01:29:13.518 --> 01:29:14.810
a lot of alcohol
in her system.


2168
01:29:14.894 --> 01:29:15.977
There was also a Dalmane,

2169
01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:17.477
the sleeping pill
that she took.


2170
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.310
- The assumption was,
when she went down below,


2171
01:29:20.393 --> 01:29:22.185
she could have gone out

2172
01:29:22.268 --> 01:29:24.101
to retie the dinghy.

2173
01:29:24.185 --> 01:29:26.310
- Well, I remember it used
to drive her crazy,


2174
01:29:26.393 --> 01:29:28.810
and she would always say,
"RJ, can you move the dinghy?


2175
01:29:28.894 --> 01:29:31.602
- Yeah, 'cause it--
- 'Cause the way the water hit


2176
01:29:31.685 --> 01:29:33.477
up against the boat,
it would bang,


2177
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.351
and she was
so sensitive to noise.


2178
01:29:35.435 --> 01:29:37.143
- Yeah, and when
she went out there, was--


2179
01:29:37.226 --> 01:29:39.143
it was a slight mist
that night...


2180
01:29:39.226 --> 01:29:42.226
- Mm-hmm.
- And the assumption is that


2181
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.226
she went out and slipped

2182
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:46.226
and hit her head

2183
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:48.477
and rolled into the water.
- Mm-hmm.


2184
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.268
- But there's
always conjecture


2185
01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.560
about someone
who's very famous,


2186
01:29:52.643 --> 01:29:56.185
and your mother
was a very famous person.


2187
01:29:56.268 --> 01:29:57.643
And there's always conjecture,
I think,


2188
01:29:57.727 --> 01:29:59.019
you know, that always comes up

2189
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:00.351
but not to this degree.

2190
01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:02.019
I mean,
this has really been something


2191
01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:03.727
that the media
has taken over.


2192
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:05.351
- We were approached
by a news agency


2193
01:30:05.435 --> 01:30:07.351
who wanted to take another look
at the case.


2194
01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:08.727
We thought it was
a good idea


2195
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:10.310
to try and go ahead
and do that.


2196
01:30:10.393 --> 01:30:12.185
- What's a person of interest?

2197
01:30:12.268 --> 01:30:13.852
- Just that.
He's a person of interest


2198
01:30:13.935 --> 01:30:17.019
like...he was there with her,

2199
01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:19.560
last person with her
before she ends up dead.


2200
01:30:19.643 --> 01:30:21.727
- How does it make you feel

2201
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:24.060
when they call you
a person of interest?


2202
01:30:24.143 --> 01:30:26.560
- I don't pay very much
attention to it, Natasha,


2203
01:30:26.643 --> 01:30:28.602
because they're not
gonna redefine me.


2204
01:30:28.685 --> 01:30:30.019
- That's right.

2205
01:30:30.101 --> 01:30:31.268
- You know, they're not
gonna redefine me.


2206
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:32.518
I know who I am.

2207
01:30:32.602 --> 01:30:36.393
- But it's important to me,
Daddy, that people


2208
01:30:36.477 --> 01:30:40.060
think of you
the way I know that you are,


2209
01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:43.727
and it bothers me
that anyone would ever think


2210
01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:47.019
that you would be involved
in what happened to her,


2211
01:30:47.101 --> 01:30:51.393
because you would've given
your life for my mom.


2212
01:30:51.477 --> 01:30:53.393
- And that's true.
I would've.


2213
01:30:53.477 --> 01:30:56.727
We all would've.
I mean, if there was an--


2214
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:57.727
if we'd have heard anything

2215
01:30:57.810 --> 01:30:59.769
or known anything
that was going on


2216
01:30:59.852 --> 01:31:02.101
or any kind of disaster
was gonna take place,


2217
01:31:02.185 --> 01:31:04.101
we'd have been there.

2218
01:31:04.185 --> 01:31:06.393
- Have you ever been back
to Catalina?


2219
01:31:06.477 --> 01:31:09.518
- No, I never have gone back
to the island.


2220
01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:12.268
I see it once in a while.

2221
01:31:12.351 --> 01:31:13.935
You know how sometimes
you can see it,


2222
01:31:14.019 --> 01:31:15.435
it's so clear?
- Mm-hmm.


2223
01:31:15.518 --> 01:31:18.935
- Or if I'm taking off
from LAX, you know,


2224
01:31:19.019 --> 01:31:21.894
they turn to the south,
and you go by the island,


2225
01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:23.643
and I look down
at the Isthmus,


2226
01:31:23.727 --> 01:31:26.435
and I think of all
of the great times


2227
01:31:26.518 --> 01:31:27.560
that we had there

2228
01:31:27.643 --> 01:31:29.935
and all of the wonderful
life-giving experiences,


2229
01:31:30.019 --> 01:31:33.268
and...you know,
it's just so ironic


2230
01:31:33.351 --> 01:31:36.560
that this all happened,

2231
01:31:36.643 --> 01:31:38.769
you know, that it came
to an end like that, so...


2232
01:31:38.852 --> 01:31:40.643
No, but I never
have been back.


2233
01:31:40.727 --> 01:31:42.643
- Do you have any interest
in going back?


2234
01:31:42.727 --> 01:31:43.977
- Not particularly, no.

2235
01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.518
- Do you think
that the real story


2236
01:31:45.602 --> 01:31:48.977
of Natalie Wood's death
has actually come out?


2237
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.977
- The real story of her death

2238
01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.727
is that she...

2239
01:31:54.226 --> 01:31:56.185
Drowned,

2240
01:31:56.268 --> 01:31:59.977
and...nobody knows
how she drowned


2241
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.977
or what happened

2242
01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.977
except...her.

2243
01:32:07.226 --> 01:32:09.685
- Even if you have black
and white in the situation,


2244
01:32:09.769 --> 01:32:12.019
the tabloid media
will create gray,


2245
01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:13.810
so every year
around the anniversary


2246
01:32:13.894 --> 01:32:15.643
of Natalie's death,
you'd always start


2247
01:32:15.727 --> 01:32:17.769
to see things pop up,

2248
01:32:17.852 --> 01:32:19.977
'cause that's when they
can sell the most.


2249
01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.185
And I've had conversations
with editors.


2250
01:32:22.268 --> 01:32:25.643
"Why do you keep running
these awful stories today?"


2251
01:32:25.727 --> 01:32:27.935
"Because they still want
to read about it,


2252
01:32:28.019 --> 01:32:29.977
so they're still
making us money."


2253
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.518
A lot of people
have made money


2254
01:32:31.602 --> 01:32:33.185
off of Natalie Wood's death.

2255
01:32:33.268 --> 01:32:37.019
- On that level,
they're just barracudas.


2256
01:32:37.101 --> 01:32:38.310
They're just feeding
on something


2257
01:32:38.393 --> 01:32:40.852
that means nothing to them,

2258
01:32:40.935 --> 01:32:44.852
and because this meant
so much to us,


2259
01:32:44.935 --> 01:32:48.351
to ever exploit
this situation


2260
01:32:48.435 --> 01:32:50.060
would be criminal to do that,

2261
01:32:50.143 --> 01:32:53.019
and I know there are people
who want to talk about it,


2262
01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:55.685
but they're doing it
for themselves,


2263
01:32:55.769 --> 01:32:56.894
and how dare they?

2264
01:32:56.977 --> 01:32:59.226
How dare they?

2265
01:32:59.310 --> 01:33:00.894
- I think the investigation

2266
01:33:00.977 --> 01:33:02.393
was mishandled
from the beginning.


2267
01:33:02.477 --> 01:33:05.602
Things were oversimplified
and ignored.


2268
01:33:05.685 --> 01:33:08.685
Conspiracy is
a bit far-fetched,


2269
01:33:08.769 --> 01:33:13.560
but were things covered up
and overlooked purposefully?


2270
01:33:13.643 --> 01:33:15.518
I'm certain they were.

2271
01:33:15.602 --> 01:33:18.310
- What I read in the press
and I see on these TV shows


2272
01:33:18.393 --> 01:33:20.226
when Lana appears

2273
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:22.393
really upsets me

2274
01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:24.393
'cause it hurts RJ,
it hurts the girls,


2275
01:33:24.477 --> 01:33:27.560
it hurts the memory of Natalie,

2276
01:33:27.643 --> 01:33:30.560
and it makes me
sad and angry.


2277
01:33:30.643 --> 01:33:32.310
- Are you suggesting

2278
01:33:32.393 --> 01:33:35.852
that he knocked her out
in some way


2279
01:33:35.935 --> 01:33:37.268
and threw her
in the water, or--


2280
01:33:37.351 --> 01:33:40.226
- It is something like that,
absolutely.


2281
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:42.393
- Natalie was very kind
to Lana,


2282
01:33:42.477 --> 01:33:45.101
very respectful
of her situation,


2283
01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:47.435
because Natalie was the one
who was the big success


2284
01:33:47.518 --> 01:33:49.019
with the parents,

2285
01:33:49.101 --> 01:33:51.602
and Natalie took
great care of her.


2286
01:33:51.685 --> 01:33:53.769
- Lana became an actress,

2287
01:33:53.852 --> 01:33:56.268
I think, because her sister
was a star,


2288
01:33:56.351 --> 01:33:58.226
and her name was not Wood,

2289
01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:01.101
but her mother changed it
to Lana Wood.


2290
01:34:01.185 --> 01:34:02.935
- I don't know;
the whole thing with Lana,


2291
01:34:03.019 --> 01:34:04.602
it's just...

2292
01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:08.143
I don't even think
she believes what she's saying.


2293
01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:10.769
I think she's just angry,
and I can understand that.


2294
01:34:10.852 --> 01:34:12.894
I can understand being angry.

2295
01:34:12.977 --> 01:34:15.226
I can certainly understand
having misplaced feelings.


2296
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:17.435
I can understand
all of that,


2297
01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:20.060
but when I just think
about, like, my dad


2298
01:34:20.143 --> 01:34:21.643
having to deal
with any of this stuff,


2299
01:34:21.727 --> 01:34:23.935
it's just so hard
to even imagine


2300
01:34:24.019 --> 01:34:28.143
when, you know, he experienced,
like, a true nightmare.


2301
01:34:28.226 --> 01:34:30.310
I mean, a true nightmare.

2302
01:34:30.393 --> 01:34:32.518
- One thing that I've heard
Lana say


2303
01:34:32.602 --> 01:34:35.143
is that my stepdad, RJ,

2304
01:34:35.226 --> 01:34:37.602
kept her away from us,

2305
01:34:37.685 --> 01:34:39.977
but I don't have a memory
of being close to Lana


2306
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.769
even before my mom died.

2307
01:34:41.852 --> 01:34:44.351
When she would come
to our house on Cañon Drive,


2308
01:34:44.435 --> 01:34:47.143
it always felt like she was
more focused on my mom


2309
01:34:47.226 --> 01:34:48.518
than Courtney or me,

2310
01:34:48.602 --> 01:34:51.602
so I never had that kind
of relationship with her


2311
01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:54.351
that my daughter has
with my sisters.


2312
01:34:54.435 --> 01:34:58.310
And she's literally accused
my dad of killing my mom


2313
01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:01.894
when that's the farthest thing
from the truth.


2314
01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.810
- Sadly, some of the residue
of the tragedy


2315
01:35:05.894 --> 01:35:07.435
will always be there,

2316
01:35:07.518 --> 01:35:10.019
because people like drama,
don't they, and tragedy,


2317
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:12.685
and they'll have theories
about it.


2318
01:35:12.769 --> 01:35:14.477
And even my friends
sometimes say--


2319
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.060
you know, they almost, like,
take you aside and say,


2320
01:35:17.143 --> 01:35:19.185
"Okay, you can tell me
what really happened,"


2321
01:35:19.268 --> 01:35:23.019
as if you have
some great scoop on it.


2322
01:35:23.101 --> 01:35:26.351
- Natalie Wood
falls into the category


2323
01:35:26.435 --> 01:35:28.477
of Marilyn Monroe,

2324
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.019
Elvis Presley.

2325
01:35:30.101 --> 01:35:32.060
They were such icons,

2326
01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.226
the things about their passing

2327
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:36.518
will always be brought up.

2328
01:35:36.602 --> 01:35:39.143
But Natalie is not a headline.

2329
01:35:39.226 --> 01:35:41.685
Natalie was a life
well lived.


2330
01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.518
It was foreshortened,

2331
01:35:43.602 --> 01:35:46.143
but she did a lot
in that lifetime


2332
01:35:46.226 --> 01:35:49.143
for her children,
for her friends,


2333
01:35:49.226 --> 01:35:50.935
for the industry.

2334
01:35:51.019 --> 01:35:52.769
She made a difference.

2335
01:35:52.852 --> 01:35:55.393
- It's really sad
that she died when she did,


2336
01:35:55.477 --> 01:35:58.226
because it'd be really great
to see what she was gonna do


2337
01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:01.852
as a woman in her 40s
and 50s


2338
01:36:01.935 --> 01:36:04.935
and the kinds of roles
she would take on over time


2339
01:36:05.019 --> 01:36:06.560
because she was
always grappling


2340
01:36:06.643 --> 01:36:09.060
with what it means
to be a woman


2341
01:36:09.143 --> 01:36:11.602
in different stages of life.
- Ah!


2342
01:36:11.685 --> 01:36:13.560
- But that's the great thing
about being an actor.


2343
01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:17.393
You're always alive.
Those movies still exist.


2344
01:36:17.477 --> 01:36:18.977
- Natalie was unique.

2345
01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.393
She doesn't have
a false moment in her films.


2346
01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:24.101
She didn't "act."

2347
01:36:24.185 --> 01:36:26.602
She found something in her gut,

2348
01:36:26.685 --> 01:36:28.810
in her heart,
and in her intellect,


2349
01:36:28.894 --> 01:36:30.810
and she applied all of that.

2350
01:36:30.894 --> 01:36:33.019
- I love you, Mother.

2351
01:36:33.101 --> 01:36:35.769
- And young women
seeing that now,


2352
01:36:35.852 --> 01:36:38.226
supposing you decide to catch
one of these movies,


2353
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:39.643
you'd be struck

2354
01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:43.226
by a multidimensional
young woman


2355
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:46.769
unafraid to show
her vulnerabilities,


2356
01:36:46.852 --> 01:36:49.602
her passion, her strength,

2357
01:36:49.685 --> 01:36:51.477
and her intelligence.

2358
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.101
All of that is there.

2359
01:36:53.185 --> 01:36:54.602
- Won't you join me
back in the limelight,


2360
01:36:54.685 --> 01:36:56.185
little lady of pain?

2361
01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:58.393
All she was
ever looking for


2362
01:36:58.477 --> 01:37:02.185
was the comfort
of good friends, good people,


2363
01:37:02.268 --> 01:37:04.643
and being able to be
a normal human being.


2364
01:37:04.727 --> 01:37:06.393
That was her search.

2365
01:37:06.477 --> 01:37:08.602
It was so hard
against the reputation


2366
01:37:08.685 --> 01:37:09.769
of being a movie star.

2367
01:37:09.852 --> 01:37:12.810
And I witnessed her desire,
her reaching out


2368
01:37:12.894 --> 01:37:15.643
to try to be
just a regular human being


2369
01:37:15.727 --> 01:37:17.435
against the odds
of being treated


2370
01:37:17.518 --> 01:37:18.560
like a movie star,

2371
01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:20.518
and she did it beautifully.
