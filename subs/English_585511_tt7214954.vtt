00:23:41.572 --> 00:23:43.032
so we'll be taking that now.

318
00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.036
- Uh-oh.
- You know what,


319
00:23:45.172 --> 00:23:47.808
I'll just turn it in
myself today.


320
00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:50.543
Uh, if you say so, Bob.
Good luck with that.


321
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:54.350
Yeah. Say hi to the Captain for us.
We know how much she loves you.


322
00:23:54.486 --> 00:23:55.984
But she doesn't love him.

323
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.924
- [QUINN] I was being ironical.
- You're so clever.


324
00:23:57.948 --> 00:23:59.282
What have I done?

325
00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:01.452
I wasn't supposed to
stop and eat human food.


326
00:24:01.588 --> 00:24:03.954
I definitely wasn't supposed
to talk in front of a human.


327
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.561
And I sure as heck wasn't supposed to
let the human who lost my travel penny


328
00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:09.496
follow me through the portal!

329
00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:13.600
Okay, but those leprechauns just
said something about a Penny Depot.


330
00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:15.568
Maybe we could get one there.

331
00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:19.374
Only leprechauns are allowed inside,
and you are not a leprechaun!


332
00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:21.440
But maybe I could be.

333
00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:23.610
[LAUGHS] What?

334
00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:25.825
You think you're just gonna march
down to the leprechaun locker room


335
00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:27.520
and.. And.. And
borrow some clothes?


336
00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:30.680
- Brilliant idea. Let's go.
- No, wait. Stop!


337
00:24:30.815 --> 00:24:31.947
Just stop!

00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:35.186
Hey, Bob. Everything okay?

Aye, just, uh,

Even if you could masquerade
as some freakishly big leprechaun,


343
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.899
I can't get past the Captain
without turning in a penny.


344
00:24:49.034 --> 00:24:51.339
What if you turned in this?

345
00:24:51.474 --> 00:24:53.842
This is a button.

346
00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:56.374
And at some point,
they will discover it,


347
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.216
and if I don't have a lucky
penny in hand when they do,


348
00:24:59.351 --> 00:25:01.048
I'll be banished.

349
00:25:01.183 --> 00:25:05.052
Okay, but maybe the button
buys us a little time


350
00:25:05.187 --> 00:25:07.683
until we get a lucky penny
from the Penny Depot.


351
00:25:07.818 --> 00:25:10.178
- Then I'll borrow it for my frie..
- For your friend Hazel.


352
00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:12.432
Yes, I've got that part.

353
00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:15.667
What? You said it, like,
a hundred times.


354
00:25:15.803 --> 00:25:18.130
We'll go to the Penny Depot
to get one penny.


355
00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:20.638
I use it first,
and then it's all yours.


356
00:25:22.573 --> 00:25:23.674
And then I'll leave.

Catch you on the flip side, Cap.

- That's the Captain?
- Aye, that's her.

She really doesn't like me.

Maybe she's not a cat person.

Well, she likes
the other cats just fine.


375
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.293
So, what's the plan?

376
00:26:15.429 --> 00:26:19.189
Right. You sneak out that door
over there. I'll keep the Captain busy.

When you're clear, I'll drop in the

Drop your penny.

Aye, I got it right here, Cap.

But first,
how's your day been so far?

Okay, Bob, what are you up to?

385
00:26:41.979 --> 00:26:45.322
[CHUCKLES] Why can't a cat
ask how his boss's day is going?


386
00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:47.121
Because it's weird, Bob.

387
00:26:47.256 --> 00:26:50.223
Because you never
have asked me anything, Bob.


388
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.527
Because we don't
even like each other, Bob.


389
00:26:52.662 --> 00:26:57.864
Because you give me the heebie-jeebies,
and you always have, Bob.

Oh, is that all?

Only the funny ones, Bob.

[CHUCKLES] Right. Well,
then you'll love this one.

Why did the penny
arrest the nickel?

I don't know, Bob. Why?

396
00:27:14.487 --> 00:27:16.413

00:38:40.707 --> 00:38:43.399
So, first, we'll have to grab
a good luck crystal to power it.


621
00:38:43.534 --> 00:38:45.900
- And where do we get one of those?
- The Luck Floor!


622
00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:47.703
Whoa, whoa. Hold up a minute.

623
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:50.810
I'll head to Arrivals and Departures
and fire up the bunny drone


624
00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:52.520
while you two sneak
into Mission Control.


625
00:38:52.544 --> 00:38:54.610
Wait. Why?

626
00:38:54.746 --> 00:38:56.857
That's where they keep the
joystick that controls the drone.


627
00:38:56.881 --> 00:38:58.913
Great! But crystal first.

628
00:38:59.049 --> 00:39:01.883
So, Luck Floor, here we come.

629
00:39:02.019 --> 00:39:05.988
Ooh, but the crystals are up high.
We'll need someone tall to reach it.


630
00:39:06.123 --> 00:39:08.398
- I'm tall.
- Not a chance.


631
00:39:08.533 --> 00:39:10.766
- She's way too unlucky.
- It's true.


632
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:13.899
Oh, she only has to grab one.
I think she can do it.


633
00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:18.900
Oh, fine. I mean,
what could go wrong?


634
00:39:19.036 --> 00:39:20.477
That's the spirit, boss.

635
00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:29.480
[WHISPERING] Sounds like
our little deal is back on, Bob.


636
00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:32.247
- [WHISPERING] Yes, and then you'll leave.
- True to my word.


637
00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:35.417
So, where do we get
the luck crystal?


638
00:39:35.553 --> 00:39:37.729
[GERRY] We'll just walk
down the hall and snag one.


639
00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:38.957
Piece of cake.

640
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:49.165
They're all staring right
at Sam. What do we do, boss?


641
00:39:51.507 --> 00:39:55.681
She's from Latvia. Tallest leprechauns
in the world come from Latvia.


642
00:39:55.816 --> 00:39:58.845
And we're her Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guides.


643
00:40:01.086 --> 00:40:02.886
Lead on, Gerry.

644
00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:04.554
Uh, right!

645
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:15.291
So, this is Good Luck R and D,
where good luck is created.


646
00:40:15.426 --> 00:40:18.094
Finding your lost
wedding ring in the brownies?


647
00:40:18.229 --> 00:40:20.470
Shirley always comes
up with the best stuff.


648
00:40:20.605 --> 00:40:23.670
Wait. They actually
think up the good luck?


649
00:40:23.806 --> 00:40:26.436
Yeah. Those two
work in Happy Accidents,


650
00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:30.439
one of the many Good Luck
departments like Lucky in Love,


651
00:40:30.575 --> 00:40:33.479
Front Row Parking Spot..
Ooh! Right Place, Right Time.


652
00:40:33.615 --> 00:40:35.546
You humans love that one.

653
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:39.517
And by "humans," you mean the
ones who live in the human world,


654
00:40:39.652 --> 00:40:40.792
don't ya, Ger?

655
00:40:40.928 --> 00:40:43.023
Exactly right.

656
00:40:43.158 --> 00:40:46.526
Next, the lucky ideas
are stamped onto an idea leaf,


657
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:48.523
and then sent to the Luck Floor.

658
00:40:48.658 --> 00:40:52.098
And luck passing through
in five, four, three, two...


659
00:40:52.234 --> 00:40:54.571
Let's take this tour to
the upper level, shall we?


660
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.747
[GERRY] The ladybugs deliver
the leaves to the Pig Foreman.


661
00:41:10.883 --> 00:41:12.351
And he makes the crystals?

662
00:41:12.487 --> 00:41:14.393
Nah, they do.

663
00:41:16.321 --> 00:41:19.926
Latvia.
She's from Latvia. Latvia.


664
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:27.367
For the crystal.
Janice said I could borrow it.


665
00:41:27.503 --> 00:41:29.603
All right, luck makers!

666
00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:32.033
We've got a full docket today!

667
00:41:32.168 --> 00:41:34.839
Good morning, magical swine!

668
00:41:34.974 --> 00:41:36.172
- A dragon?
- [PIGS CHEER]


669
00:41:36.308 --> 00:41:37.680
Yeah, she's the CEO
of Good Luck.


670
00:41:40.183 --> 00:41:43.450
And the only creature that can
sniff out bad luck specks.


671
00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:45.184
Probably why she's here.

672
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.266
She must've heard what
happened at the Penny Depot.


673
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.824
[SNIFFING]

674
00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:54.565
Uh, with your luck,
I wouldnae get too close.


675
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.997
Ta-da!

676
00:41:58.132 --> 00:42:00.631
There's not a speck
of bad luck here.


677
00:42:00.766 --> 00:42:04.269
- [CHEERING, WHISTLING] - Which
means it's that time again.


678
00:42:04.404 --> 00:42:08.780
Time to open your hearts
to do what only you can do.


679
00:42:08.915 --> 00:42:12.112
- Let me hear it!
- Bring hope and joy to the world!


680
00:42:12.247 --> 00:42:15.115
- [CHEERS, WHISTLES]
- That's what good luck does.


681
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:18.380
The luck you create today
could change a life tomorrow.


682
00:42:20.557 --> 00:42:21.992
Have a lucky day, Phil.

683
00:42:22.128 --> 00:42:23.319
You too, Boss.

684
00:42:29.863 --> 00:42:31.826
[PHIL] Okay, you heard her!

685
00:42:31.961 --> 00:42:35.732
Let's make some good luck, you
prosperity-making wonder pigs!


686
00:42:35.867 --> 00:42:36.904
[BOB] Duck down!

687
00:42:40.211 --> 00:42:41.337
[BLOWING]

688
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:48.881
[SAM] They're doing it.
They're making the crystals.


689
00:42:49.017 --> 00:42:50.686
And we just need
one for the bunny drone.


690
00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:53.556
- This is it, Sam. Get ready.
- Ready.


691
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:56.525
- Now, Sam! Grab one!
- [STRAINS]


692
00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.023
I can't quite reach. [STRAINS]

693
00:43:00.158 --> 00:43:02.327
- Jump!
- No, she's too unlucky!


694
00:43:02.463 --> 00:43:03.891
[GRUNTS]

695
00:43:04.027 --> 00:43:05.295
Whoa! [GASPS]

696
00:43:06.863 --> 00:43:07.968
[GASPS]

697
00:43:09.174 --> 00:43:10.300
[EXCLAIMS]

698
00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:15.375
[SIGHS] Nice move, Bob!

699
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.475
Way to go, team!

700
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.112
I'll go to Arrivals and
Departures and find the drone.


701
00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:21.887
You guys head straight
to Mission Control.


702
00:43:23.657 --> 00:43:26.151
Because of you,
Bob has a real chance.


703
00:43:27.417 --> 00:43:29.187
You can keep my
jacket if you want!


704
00:43:30.428 --> 00:43:31.958
You have nice friends.

705
00:43:32.094 --> 00:43:34.533
Yeah, like I said,
he's just my assistant.


706
00:43:36.936 --> 00:43:39.364
I know we'd still need
to get you a lucky penny,


707
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.570
but why couldn't
I just take Hazel one of those?


708
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.670
[BOB] It doesn't work that way.

709
00:43:43.805 --> 00:43:47.008
The good luck idea is stored
inside the crystal until it's released,


710
00:43:47.144 --> 00:43:48.952
and there's only one thing
that can release it.


711
00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:50.811
- What's that?
- The Randomizer.


712
00:43:50.947 --> 00:43:53.281
It smashes the crystals
into lucky dust,


713
00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:56.247
then sends it randomly through
the luck lines into your world.


714
00:43:56.382 --> 00:43:58.685
Wait. You're saying
luck is random?


715
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.920
Aye. Hence the name, Randomizer.

716
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:04.125
Look, it's happening right now.

717
00:44:04.261 --> 00:44:07.292
- [SAM] What are those?
- [BOB] The ancient luck stones.


718
00:44:07.427 --> 00:44:09.801
Like the batteries
that keep the arms spinning.


719
00:44:09.937 --> 00:44:12.870
The good luck stone draws in
the good luck from above,


720
00:44:13.006 --> 00:44:15.706
and the bad luck stone draws
in the bad luck from below.


721
00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:18.770
And those must
be the luck lines.


722
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:20.106
[BOB] Aye, that's them.

723
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.874
Like the power cords
connecting our worlds.


724
00:44:23.009 --> 00:44:25.040
So, who makes the bad luck?

725
00:44:25.176 --> 00:44:26.546
Roots and goblins, mainly.

726
00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:28.851
Roots and goblins?

727
00:44:28.986 --> 00:44:31.078
I should have known
it would be monsters.


728
00:44:31.214 --> 00:44:32.948
Gerry, are ya there?

729
00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:34.963
[GERRY]<i>10-4. Reading
you loud and clear, boss.</i>

00:44:36.689 --> 00:44:38.889

and Departures right now.

[BOB]<i>Good. Make it quick.</i>

733
00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:43.866
- Oh. Hey, Gerry.
- [CLEARS THROAT] Gael. Quinn.


734
00:44:53.243 --> 00:44:55.679
- [GERRY]<i>I found the drone.</i>
- Good. We're here.


735
00:44:55.814 --> 00:44:57.609
- Mission Control.
- [GERRY]<i>Great.</i>


736
00:44:57.744 --> 00:45:00.183
<i>- All the bunny desks have a joystick.</i>
- Perfect!


737
00:45:00.318 --> 00:45:03.688
We'll use that back one. That
way no one can see my screen.


738
00:45:03.823 --> 00:45:05.622
But how are
we gonna distract the bunny?


739
00:45:05.758 --> 00:45:07.816
- Ooh! Maybe I could try..
- Uh-uh!


740
00:45:07.952 --> 00:45:11.194
No trying, remember? We've
seen what happens when you do.


741
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:12.797
Oh, okay.

742
00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:15.664
I've got this one covered.
You wait right here.


743
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.637
I mean it. Don't move a muscle.

744
00:45:22.504 --> 00:45:25.105
[SAM] Whoa. They're tracking
luck all over the world.


745
00:45:34.587 --> 00:45:36.314
That's one lucky grandma.

746
00:45:38.058 --> 00:45:39.058
Aw.

747
00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:44.091
Now, that looks familiar.

748
00:45:44.955 --> 00:45:46.024
Ooh.

749
00:45:46.159 --> 00:45:48.260
It doesn't feel random, does it?

750
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.103
So, how's your day so far?

751
00:45:53.238 --> 00:45:54.238
Good.

752

01:03:26.853 --> 01:03:28.419
It isn't.

1071
01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:32.391
I've seen them when
I'm out leprechauning.


1072
01:03:32.527 --> 01:03:37.361
These unlucky humans, who,
no matter how hard they try,


1073
01:03:39.371 --> 01:03:44.140
bad luck always shows up just to
beat them down and make them feel so...


1074
01:03:44.275 --> 01:03:45.875
Alone.

1075
01:03:47.004 --> 01:03:48.042
Exactly.

1076
01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:52.109
Which is why we make
the good kind of luck,


1077
01:03:52.244 --> 01:03:54.315
and as much as we possibly can.

1078
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.552
Yeah.

1079
01:03:56.687 --> 01:03:59.888
'Cause when you have good luck,
it feels like anything is possible.


1080
01:04:00.024 --> 01:04:02.322
- I guess it's because..
- Good luck is joy.


1081
01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.293
Yes.

1082
01:04:04.429 --> 01:04:09.028
And hope. It's like you said,
it's the good kind of luck.


1083
01:04:09.164 --> 01:04:15.367
And were I the queen of the universe, and
I suspect it's a job I would excel at,


1084
01:04:15.502 --> 01:04:17.533
I'd rid the world
of bad luck altogether!


1085
01:04:17.669 --> 01:04:20.911
- [GASPS, SCREAMS]
- Eradicate it completely.


1086
01:04:21.046 --> 01:04:25.315
Good luck all the time,
what could be better?


1087
01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:26.807
Not a single thing.

1088
01:04:26.942 --> 01:04:29.611
And you can bet those
humans would like it too.


1089
01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:33.921
Yeah. Then their world
could look like this.


1090
01:04:34.057 --> 01:04:36.149
[CHUCKLES]
They should be so lucky.


1091
01:04:36.284 --> 01:04:40.429
You did the right thing coming to
see me. You.. What was your name?


1092
01:04:40.565 --> 01:04:42.866
Oh, Sam. My name is Sam.

1093
01:04:44.095 --> 01:04:46.930
Sam. Call me Babe.

1094
01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:50.467
You know a lot of creatures are
intimidated by tall women, Sam.


1095
01:04:58.574 --> 01:05:01.951
Carry it for a few days. You'll be
back to your lucky self in no time.


1096
01:05:03.949 --> 01:05:07.182
The last creature I helped
needed four months with a penny


1097
01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:09.120
until his bad luck was gone.

1098

I've heard it can really linger.

1099
01:05:11.556 --> 01:05:14.658
They were the best
four months of my life.

Just return it to

Get off me. I won't
be cat-handled like this.


1108
01:05:37.452 --> 01:05:39.983
We traced the missing
penny back to you, Bob.


1109
01:05:40.118 --> 01:05:41.418
You have no proof.

1110

This button is
all the proof we need.

- It's too late.

I oughta arrest you too.


1117
01:06:12.156 --> 01:06:14.686
I was just catching up
to Bob to give him this.


1118
01:06:14.822 --> 01:06:16.491
You got it.

1119
01:06:16.626 --> 01:06:18.753
Yes, Bob. I did.

1120
01:06:18.889 --> 01:06:21.096
Must've fallen right out
of his collar.


1121
01:06:22.828 --> 01:06:25.728
Maybe when you stopped
to try that tasty meat bread.


1122
01:06:25.863 --> 01:06:28.767
And you're absolutely
sure this one is mine?


1123
01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:30.699
I'm sure.

1124
01:06:30.835 --> 01:06:34.007
[CHUCKLES] She's a real lifesaver,
this one.


1125
01:06:34.142 --> 01:06:37.741
[GRUMBLING] If you had your travel penny,
why did you turn in the button, Bob?


1126
01:06:37.877 --> 01:06:41.079
Silly mistake. I just threw
the wrong one into the drop.


1127
01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:42.613
When I discovered the mix-up,

1128
01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:45.453
I was heading straight
back to Decon to turn it in,


1129
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:49.126
and then I guess that's when the
little bugger just slipped out.


1130
01:06:49.261 --> 01:06:52.829
[CHUCKLES] Just like that,
no travel penny. You know,


1131
01:06:52.964 --> 01:06:58.433
I'm starting to think that maybe the
equipment rabbits issued me a bum collar.


1132
01:06:58.569 --> 01:07:00.569
This isn't the first time
it's got loose, you know.


1133
01:07:00.704 --> 01:07:02.472
Oh, I see. I see.

1134
01:07:02.607 --> 01:07:06.609
Well, faulty equipment is unacceptable,
Bob. You're right.


1135
01:07:06.745 --> 01:07:08.908
Aye, it most certainly is.

1136
01:07:09.043 --> 01:07:10.178
Here you go, Captain.

1137
01:07:14.883 --> 01:07:19.149
I can't believe you just did
that. I mean, thank you, like, a lot,


1138
01:07:19.284 --> 01:07:22.222
but you could've taken that
penny straight to your friend Hazel.


1139
01:07:22.358 --> 01:07:25.289
Her first, then me,
that was the deal.


1140
01:07:25.424 --> 01:07:29.289
I could never let you be sent to Bad
Luck so that Hazel could have good luck.


1141
01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:31.998
- It doesn't work like that.
- [BOB] Well, how does it work?


1142
01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:35.601
Because I don't want you to go
home and leave me here feeling guilty


1143
01:07:35.736 --> 01:07:37.806
that she doesn't get
to use a lucky penny now.


1144
01:07:37.942 --> 01:07:39.576
You think I'm going home?

1145
01:07:39.711 --> 01:07:41.138
Wait. You're not?

1146
01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:43.477
I came here to help Hazel,

1147
01:07:43.613 --> 01:07:46.680
and I only have one hour left
to do it before her visit.


1148
01:07:46.815 --> 01:07:49.514
If you're actually feeling
guilty, then you can help me.


1149
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.783
But there's no way
to get another penny.


1150
01:07:52.919 --> 01:07:55.058
For what we're doing,
we won't need a penny.


1151
01:07:56.024 --> 01:07:57.024
What are we gonna do?

1152
01:07:58.856 --> 01:08:00.558
[SAM]
We're gonna turn off bad luck.


1153
01:08:00.693 --> 01:08:02.463
If we shut down
Jeff's mixer machine,


1154
01:08:02.599 --> 01:08:05.530
the bad luck should stick
to itself and clog up the pipe


1155
01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.367
so it can't travel
to the Randomizer.


1156
01:08:07.503 --> 01:08:11.006
And if no bad luck
gets to the Randomizer...


1157
01:08:11.142 --> 01:08:13.368
[SAM] No bad luck
gets to the human world.


1158
01:08:13.503 --> 01:08:15.202
Wait. What about Jeff?

1159
01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:18.615
<i>Und schneller. Und schneller.

1161
01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:23.548
I have no words.

1162
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:26.122
Yeah, I think
we're good for a bit.


1163
01:08:27.952 --> 01:08:30.489
You know we can't do
this permanently, right?


1164
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:33.125
Of course not.
That's where you come in.


1165
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:35.294
I'm gonna turn it back on.

1166
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:37.530
All Hazel needs
is two hours tops.


1167
01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:39.996
And then I flip
the switch. And that's it.

Great. Here goes.

1171
01:08:57.822 --> 01:08:59.518
[BOB] Look at that.

1172
01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:02.290
It's starting to stick.

1173
01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:09.328
[SAM] It's working.

1174
01:09:10.099 --> 01:09:11.701
I wish I could see Hazel.

1175
01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:13.698
I think I can handle that.

1176
01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:17.031
Really? She lives two miles
east of the café.


1177
01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:19.739
Tell me again why
she needs good luck so badly.


1178
01:09:19.874 --> 01:09:22.778
If her visit goes well, she
could find her forever family.


1179
01:09:22.913 --> 01:09:24.946
Which is what exactly?

1180
01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:28.580
It's the people who are always
there for you, no matter what happens.


1181

- [SAM] Yeah.


1184
01:09:38.854 --> 01:09:42.188
It looks like the couple will be
there any minute. It's all I hoped for,


1185
01:09:42.324 --> 01:09:45.694
a little good luck for Hazel,
and we did it, Bob.


1186
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.596
I swear I could
hug you right now.


1187
