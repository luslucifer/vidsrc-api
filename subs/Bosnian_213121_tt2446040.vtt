mozes ubiti vampira!

26
00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:26.321
To je samo macka.

27
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:29.091
- Klasika,da povecaju neizvesnost.
- Macka?


28
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.740
Hajde,momci,to nije strasno!

Bila je u kutiji,napustenoj godinama.

38
00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:08.237
Ne

39
00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.695
Nisam mogla da izadjem.

40

<i>Mama,mogu da ponesem igracke?</i>

dogod nisam sama
zatvorena u toj kutiji.


58
00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:07.208
Samo treba da se potpisete

59
00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:09.622
I platite depozit,

- Gospodine Krompirko,ne iz kofera.


75
00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:51.196
Motel je mesto gde se
igracke najlakse izgube!


76
00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:52.713
Saberi se!

77
00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:54.163
Niko se nece izgubiti.

78
00:03:54.173 --> 00:03:57.343
A i inace,obecavam ti
uzecu nesto lepo..

00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:04.762
Ne zelim to da propustim.

83
00:04:04.772 --> 00:04:07.093
Hajde,momci.mi smo i dalje
svi u koferu.


84
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.041
Buzz,mislim na to dvoje.

I "tako" pocinje...

92
00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:40.870
Mr. Pricklepants,ne pomazete!

93
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.123
Samo sam rekao,to je
uobicajeno u ovoj vrsti filma.


94
00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:46.961
Najmanje sumnjiv lik ide
okolo,i odjednom nestane.


95
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.211
- Moguce je da je nestao.
- Mozda je ovo mesto ukleto?


96
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.295
- Sta?Ukleto?
- Naravno da nije.Svi to znaju.


97
00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.375
- Duhovi ne postoje!
- Ustvari...


98
00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:57.789
- Iz moih istrazivanja sa interneta ...
- vrlo verovatno.


99
00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.147
Mora biti logicnog objasnjenja.

100
00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:03.501
Moramo da se podelimo,u grupe po dvoje.
i da pazimo na svog para..


101
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.419
Ako se nesto desi,vristite.

102
00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.091
Stao sam na nesto..

103

105
00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:18.280
Cekaj!Ovo je film!

106
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.801
Ja bih rekao da pocinje da "slini"
kada postane stvorenje.


107
00:05:21.812 --> 00:05:23.724
Pa stagod da je...

108
00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:27.541
Gos.Krompirko je ugazio u to i
ostavio trag stopala.


109
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.317
Ako ih budemo pratili
odvesce nas do njega.


110
00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.390
- Hej,momci!
- Ne,cekaj! Trixie,nemoj!


111
00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:34.496
Trixie!

112
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.075
- Trixie?
- Gos.Krompirko?


113
00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.427
A ovo je cuveni ulazak.

114
00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:44.278
Znas,svi filmovi ga imaju.
kada se heroj pojavi...


115
00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.417
Nece se vratiti, "nikada ponovo" vratiti.

116
00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:48.790
- Rex,pozuri!
- Stizem.


117
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.484
Sada treba da pronadjemo
put do dole.


118
00:05:53.124 --> 00:05:55.224
- Evo,problem resen!
- Izvini!


119
00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:56.648
- izvinite!
- Da li ste dobro?


120
00:05:57.354 --> 00:05:59.977
- Ovde.
- Ok. i dalje smo zajedno.


121
00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.218
Stacemo dalje?

122
00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:21.014
Ovo je vreme da se
likovi razdvoje.


123
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:23.162
i budu uklonjeni,jedan po jedan..

124
00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:24.721

125
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.437
- Gde je'Mr. Pricklepants?

126
00:06:29.447 --> 00:06:33.355

Cekaj!Cekaj!Slusaj te!

128
00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:44.484

So 'we do discover.


154
00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:07.965
It's not 'a safe place for toys!

155
00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:10.561
Combat Carl will explain '
how things are.


156
00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:13.088
You scream, there is no 'escape. Get it?

157
00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:16.991
Combat Carl has seen many things.

158
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:18.486
Horrible things.

159
00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.156
Combat Carl has learned a lot.

160
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.022
You can not stay
still or I'll find you.

161
00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:25.567
be your Combat Carl?

162
00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:27.924
The only thing that has kept
Combat Carl from leaving,


163
00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:30.625
and 'the hope of seeing
its owner, Billy ...


164
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.907
For the last time.

165
00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:34.528
You must leave now,

166
00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:36.882
or you'll never see
more 'your own.


167
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:38.586
But I have to find my friends!

168
00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:41.377
That 's what happens when
try to find your friends!


169
00:08:42.733 --> 00:08:43.868
You hear that?

170
00:08:53.072 --> 00:08:54.640
He found us! We're trapped!

171
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.678
No, Combat Carl did not give up
ever, he always finds a solution.


172
00:08:57.688 --> 00:08:59.834
- We have to go, are you ready?
- What? No!


173
00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:02.317
Let the count of three! 
One, two, three!

174
00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.272
Grab my arm!

175
00:09:05.247 --> 00:09:06.356
Carl, wait!

176
00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:07.801
Carl!

177
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.313
Do not think of Combat Carl, go away!

178
00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:02.735
Let me be ugly lizard!

179
00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:05.335
Let me go. Now!

180
00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:09.960
Thank you! Well ...

181
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.530
It 'was fun.

182
00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:19.729
<i>Here comes PROBLEMS</i>

183
00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:27.063
It looks old ...

184
00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:29.262
Definitely will be worth something.

185
00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:31.524
Good work Mr. Jones!

186
00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.368
<i>Dolly COWGIRL</i>

187
00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:52.961

188
00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:54.481
Jessie!

189
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:57.247
- Buzz!
- I'm so 'happy you're okay.


190
00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.406
It 'nice to see that it is
the whole output, COWGIRL


191
00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.452
Carl!

192
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:05.916
Combat Carl would like to introduce you to combat
its scale version,


193
00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:07.496
Combat Carl Junior.

194
00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:10.662
Lady! Sorry to interrupt the party,
but there 'a roadmap to follow!


195
00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:12.178
Mr. Tasche, touches a to!

196
00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:13.639
Power of pocket!

197

Bunny tied in location!

198
00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:28.552
- Signs of our or the lizard?
- No, sir, area, and 'still free.


199
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:30.474
Hey, Old Time, as we go?

200
00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:33.327
Well sir, 'went
away from ... ninety seconds.


201
00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:35.249
I think it might come back
at any moment.


202
00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.115
Ok, let's try again.

203
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:40.315
- The third and 'the good one.
- You can do it, Junior.


204
00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:45.900
Piano ... take your time ...

205
00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:49.999
There ... are ... almost ...

206
00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:53.688
- Oh, no!
- Accident!


207
00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:55.628
That era the last

208
00:11:55.946 --> 00:11:58.053
Which means ...
What are the next!


209
00:11:58.063 --> 00:12:01.122
Do not you understand? are
the last of the Sealers!


210
00:12:01.132 --> 00:12:05.407
Look at that! The Man Zip, Buttons,
Quick Laces ... I'm next!


211
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:08.795
- I'm the next, I'm the pro ...
- Give yourself an attitude! We'll be fine.


212
00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:12.217
Oh, certainly emerge in
somehow ... in the boxes.


213
00:12:12.227 --> 00:12:14.608
- What?
- Jessie, no one will be 'boxed.


214
00:12:14.618 --> 00:12:18.397
- we'll go together.
<i>- She has an offer.</i>


215
00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:22.476
- Head Cat, what do you see?
- It 'hard to say ...


216
00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:24.300
But it seems ...

217
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.541
a cowboy.

218
00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:31.707
Let's see who 's the next to go.

219
00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:34.704
What? Two thousand dollars?

220
00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:38.427
Jones! Jones! Non but believing anymore!

221
00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:42.360
Good shipping, cowboy Andy.

222
00:12:51.172 --> 00:12:53.574
Like taking candy from a baby.

223
00:12:57.114 --> 00:12:58.879
Succeed 'to get out, right?

224
00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.410
I have no more 'idea.

225
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:05.339
What began as a film
horror and 'turned into a tragedy.


226
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:08.575
I can not believe that
we will never see more 'Bonnie.


227
00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:11.232
Do not know what I'd give to
Billy can review,


228
00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:13.646
for ... one last time.

229
00:13:14.778 --> 00:13:17.247
We'll find a way, Captain.
We'll find a way.


230
00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:19.042
You better hurry up, Sergeant.

231
00:13:19.052 --> 00:13:21.302
Offers increased
every minute that passes.


232
00:13:21.312 --> 00:13:24.884
<i>- She bid.</i>
- All in place, people!


233
00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:28.983
Ok, to me the money.

234
00:13:29.168 --> 00:13:32.070
- Who will be 'time?
- Ok, I look at me, look at me.


235
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.896
Oh my God, you're raising.

236
00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:36.835
Jonesy, Jonesy! 
Another gold mine!

237
00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:41.713
It seems that
you take a nice little trip.


238
00:13:42.798 --> 00:13:45.707
Hey, you know how to repair
a flat tire?


239
00:13:45.717 --> 00:13:48.177
Absolutely. Come on,
I'll show you how.


240
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.995
Ok guys, in and out.

241
00:13:54.816 --> 00:13:57.168
It is useless, 
I'm not high enough!

242
00:13:57.552 --> 00:14:00.896
I'm going to take Woody, together
we can get the handle.


243
00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:03.586
- Good plan, Jessie.
- There 'someone at the door!


244
00:14:05.335 --> 00:14:08.425
<i>- Even those on the counter should be sent.</i>
- Ok...


245
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.675
I will touch 'to make two trips.

246
00:14:13.632 --> 00:14:14.633
Woody!

247
00:14:14.643 --> 00:14:17.295
Ok, There seve a plan B. put
the gears in action, folks.


248
00:14:17.305 --> 00:14:19.752
That's it! Could break the
truck engine deliveries.


249
00:14:19.762 --> 00:14:23.028
How would we in broad daylight.
Also, will not make it in time.


250
00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:26.336
What do I do? At this rate
'll all end up in the boxes!


251
00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:29.300
- Of course! Jessie, repeat it!
- Say what?


252
00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:33.062
- That'll all end up in the boxes?
- Not us. You.


253
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.926
- You'll end up in a box.
- What?


254
00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:38.078
Listen, between the little lady
deliveries will enter 'through that door


255
00:14:38.088 --> 00:14:40.847
to take the other boxes,
and you will be in one of those!


256
00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:43.767
- And 'the only way to recover Woody.
- No, I can not.


257
00:14:43.777 --> 00:14:46.802
I can not do it, I can not enter
in a box, I can not!


258
00:14:46.813 --> 00:14:48.973
- There must be another way!
- And 'the only way!


259
00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:50.537
You better get a move on soldier

260
00:14:50.547 --> 00:14:53.159
we're running out of time and
this is our only chance!


261
00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:55.309
No, I can do it!

262
00:14:55.467 --> 00:14:56.920
Jesse, listen to me!

263
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.997
- Remember the training!
- But I've never done training!


264
00:15:00.007 --> 00:15:02.937
Do not think about it. when Combat
Carl and 'forced to fight,


265
00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:05.612
repeats to himself: "Combat
Carl never gives up "...


266
00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:08.304
Combat Carl is always
a way. Now say it!


267
00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:11.304
- Combat Carl never gives up!
- Not Combat Carl!


268
00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:13.415
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie always finds a way.


269
00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:15.969
- I can not hear you!
- Jessie never gives up!


270
00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:17.600
Jessie always finds a way!

271
00:15:18.288 --> 00:15:20.163
Oh, one more thing. Take it easy.

272
00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:23.392
I'll try.

273
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.459
Wake up! You are free!

274
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.183
Who dares to summon Transitron?

275
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.034
I need this box.

276
00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:47.396
Transitron freedom?

277
00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:49.640
You ', you are free! 
Give me your hand.

278
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.101
How I can 'repay?

279
00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:56.107
Lock me inside.

280
00:15:58.213 --> 00:15:59.225
Ok...

281
00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:00.818
There we go.

282
00:16:10.454 --> 00:16:11.481
Ok.

283
00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:14.354
Wait! Wait! Do not lock me up!

284
00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:15.817
I could not get out.

285
00:16:15.827 --> 00:16:19.132
Close the flaps and put the
box above, so 'keeps them closed.


286
00:16:19.142 --> 00:16:20.595
Are you sure?

287
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:22.798
No. .. for nothing.

288
00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:29.923
My great work will be 'remembered.

289
00:16:29.933 --> 00:16:32.935
<i>- Salve!</i>
- Transitron, separation!


290
00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:36.737
The plan seems to work.

291
00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.499
So far, so good.

292
00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:44.291
They forgot to
new seal?!


293
00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:46.741
What? No! No!

294
00:16:55.936 --> 00:16:58.011
- He locked!
- Oh, and now 'done


295
00:16:58.021 --> 00:16:59.981
Never get out more 'from here.

296
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:01.418
Jessie never gives up.

297
00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:02.943
Jessie always finds a way.

298
00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:06.522
- Now you can go!
- Oh, thank you very much.


299
00:17:06.532 --> 00:17:09.026
Do not forget your bags,
Bonnie. We leave in two minutes.


300
00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:10.524
Hey! Permission!

301

304
00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:36.805

305
00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:38.384

307
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.410
Woody! Woody!

308
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.272
Jessie? Jessie, this way!

309
00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:53.970
It's been a long time.

Please be patient.

312
00:17:56.653 --> 00:17:59.256
To return everything to the
right takes time.


313
00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:01.931
Stop Pricklepants, life is not '
a movie, never coming back.


314
00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:03.567

- What are you doing?
- Go straight to the car!


324
00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.503
This is not part of the plan.

325
00:18:27.486 --> 00:18:28.736

326
00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:54.343

That area 'just for employees.

334
00:19:19.714 --> 00:19:21.380
You can not come in here.

335
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.843
Those are the toys of my daughter?

336
00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:28.351

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.514
<i>- involve the authorities'.

341
00:19:45.524 --> 00:19:47.843
He's going to sell them?
Know what I do?


342
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.883
I'll give 'hundred dollars for the cowboy.

343
00:19:49.893 --> 00:19:51.899
How many do you want? Two hundred?

344
00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:01.815
The epilogue. We returned in
where everything is' started.


345

346
00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.194
- You have saved us all.
- Jessie did not give up.


347
00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:08.975
Jessie finds a way.

348
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.691
well, Woody...

349
00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:12.673
- He wants to say thank you.
- Mr. Potato Head!


350
00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:14.548
Have you seen Mr. Potato Head?

351
00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:16.284
- What, NO!
- Alas


352
00:20:16.294 --> 00:20:20.231
It seems that the monster is back
to claim one last victim.


353
00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:24.414
- No, not 'true,' right there '.
- I'm so 'happy to have you back, baby.

The laughter of the group. sign
that the worst and 'past


357
00:20:34.174 --> 00:20:36.061
and that the film is about to end.

358
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:38.206
So ... this and 'the ending?

00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:42.022
It '. I guess now
put the credits.

00:20:46.435 --> 00:20:48.503
They arrived transportation!

361
00:20:48.652 --> 00:20:50.644

I told you not to
leave your keys in the car.


371
00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:31.111
