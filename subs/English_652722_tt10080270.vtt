2
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.890
I always adapt to the worst.

3
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.910
Living in paranoia, moving carefully.

4
00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:13.982
This is my life.

5
00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:17.885
In a world of drugs, murders, slavery.

6
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.650
I do not believe that I will ever realize what
has happened in the last 9 years of my life.

7
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.070
I do not know.

8
00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.632
Everything could have happened in many ways.

9
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.830
I know he had to have
his reasons to do what he did.

10
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.350
Based on JA Redmer's novel To Kill Sarai.

11
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.590
Welcome.

12
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.010
My home is your home.

13
00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:45.967
I invite you.

14
00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:48.333
Sit down.

15
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.905
Would you like something?

16
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.590
The best tequila in all of Mexico.

17
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.070
You don't drink it at once.

18
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.210
It seeps slowly ...

19
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.970
"Six fruits".

20
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.610
I agreed to come because you promised me, 
I would not waste time.

21
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.570
Take the whore, otherwise we
have nothing to talk about.

22
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.970
I'm his sister, you idiot.

23
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:36.122
Who is he?

24
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.951
I do not know.

25
00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.782
But it's definitely not from here.

26
00:03:41.222 --> 00:03:41.959
That's better.

27
00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:46.328
So ... Let's talk about business.

28
00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.431
3 million for Guzman's head.

29
00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:55.463
As instructed, your price is 2 million?

30
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.012
What a generous offer.

31
00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:01.895
Or very desperate ...

32
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.230
I wonder why I think the one you want me to
kill would be willing to pay me double for your head?

33
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.950
Don't let the reasons interest you.

34
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.770
You're right.

35
00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.611
The only important thing is to
tell Guillermo standing behind me ...

36
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.230
That he would lower his weapon and that if he
did not do it within three seconds, he would be dead.

37
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.150
Clean it up.

38
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.297
What are you doing?

39
00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:07.217
Take your things. 
We're leaving here.

40
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:12.562
- Where did you get it from? 
- We don't have time, Lydia. 
Let's get out of here.

41
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.710
No Sarai I can't leave.

42
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.670
Trust me. Everything will be fine.

43
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.430
- This man is our only way out. 
- Javier will kill us both.

44
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.670
I'll be back for you. I promise.

45
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.954
Cover yourself Pretend you are sleeping.

46
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.290
Yeah ... You proved your point.

47
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.510
I haven't tried to prove anything, Javier.

48
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.730
Damn it! Three million.

49
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.750
Do you accept the offer?

50
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.830
3 and a half.

51
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.330
My price just jumped.

52
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.010
Son of a bitch.

53
00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:06.186
Fine.

54
00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:12.776
But only if you do
it in less than a week.

55
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.590
I will talk to you
when the task is completed.

56
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.850
Go.

57
00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:07.354
Take me out of here.

58
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:09.285
Immediately.

59
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.190
What's your name?

60
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.010
My name is Sarai.

61
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.490
Javier kidnapped me when
I was 14 years old.

62
00:07:40.703 --> 00:07:41.786
You have to help me.

63
00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:46.380
Why do you think I will help you?

64
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.770
Why don't you do that

65
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.550
My job is not mixing.

66
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.450
So, what is your job?

67
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.310
Killing people with cold blood?

68
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.850
Can you bring me to the border?

69
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.830
You can do what you want,
but please let me cross the border.

70
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.270
If you mean the US border, you must know that the
distance is greater than I want you to be in my car.

71
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.570
How long will it take?

72
00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:17.018
Can you tell me where we are?

73
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.386
Fine.

74
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.321
If you don't want to help me,
stop the car and I'll go on alone.

75
00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:38.169
Sarai, get up. 
Javier wants to see you.

76
00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:42.447
I'm talking to you, stupid.

77
00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:45.145
Where's Sarai?

78
00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.161
I do not know.

79
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:47.678
How you don `t know?

80
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.750
I'm different from others.

81
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.310
I'm Javier's favorite.

82
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.442
You can use me as a guarantee.

83
00:09:03.956 --> 00:09:05.786
Why do you think I need a guarantee?

84
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.050
And he paid you all three million dollars?

85
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.810
It does not work like that.

86
00:09:12.314 --> 00:09:13.877
And I know how Javier works.

87
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.810
If he has not given you the full
amount now, he will never give it to you.

88
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.690
He would rather kill you than do it.

89
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.950
You Go?

90
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.330
No! You will drive me to the border!

91
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.730
Javier, Sarai escaped.

92
00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:49.526
I have looked everywhere for her and she is not there. 
You have to catch this bastard. 
She definitely ran away with him.

93
00:09:49.975 --> 00:09:52.249
Javier, are you listening to me? 
I'm talking to you.

94
00:09:52.274 --> 00:09:53.253
Sarai escaped!

95
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.828
Why are you his favorite?

96
00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:16.069
I wasn't bought.

97
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.330
My mother brought me here.

98
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.790
Javier saw something in me
that he didn't see in others.

99
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.750
He calls it love. 
And I am a sick obsession.

100
00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:33.130
I just want to go home.

101
00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:35.791
I can pay you and
I will find a way.

102
00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:39.072
I will keep my word.

103
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.590
That's all I have.

104
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.190
I will not hide from you. 
I will pay my debt.

105
00:10:46.074 --> 00:10:51.989
If the drug dealer thinks he's in love
with you, then you shouldn't hide from me.

106
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.830
So, you know my danger.

107
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.670
It still doesn't make you my duty.

108
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.030
If you had a daughter
or sister, you would care.

109
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.930
I had my life before
my mother brought me from Spain.

110
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.350
Not much, but ... at least her.

111
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.310
What are you doing?

112
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.470
Do not kill me.

113
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.770
Do not move.

114
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.630
Don't open or leave.

115
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.470
Where's Sarai?!

116
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.610
Isel.

117
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.850
Javier wants to know why
you didn't hand her over.

118
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.570
Sit down.

119
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.610
No, I think it's wrong, if
you think I came to visit here.

120
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.030
Bring me Sarai.

121
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.070
Or if you want, we can be
alone for a moment. You and me...

122
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.290
Wouldn't you like

123
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.850
Would you rather shoot me than fuck?

124
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.790
I prefer.

125
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.710
Bring me Sarai.

126
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.330
I told you to sit down.

127
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:54.270
You can tell me what Javier's
real purpose was when he hired me.

128
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.030
What do you mean?

129
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.350
If Javier wanted to kill Guzman, none
of his men would shoot at me.

130
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.350
Javier wants Guzman dead.

131
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.390
Otherwise he wouldn't let
you go with the money.

132
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.830
If I kill Guzman, 
I won't have a problem getting more money.

133
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.130
Exactly. You didn't even think that ...

134
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.990
This woman was not bought or sold.

135
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.250
I didn't ask you.

136
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.230
You did not have to.

137
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.030
I understand that you play
the role of a hero.

138
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.830
Let's say this is my payment guarantee.

139
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.730
Javier will not like this idea because
this woman is not part of the contract.

140
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.410
I don't care what Javier thinks.

141
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.030
Go tell him that this
is the deal from now on.

142
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.630
The girl will be with
me until I kill Guzman.

143
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.150
We will make a replacement later. 
A girl for my money.

144
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.790
You don't understand anything, you fool.

145
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.570
If you need a hooker, 
Javier can give you everything you want.

146
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.870
But this woman won't give you.

147
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.130
You will just wake up the monster.

148
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.050
And I won't believe you want it.

149
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.030
Hands behind the chair.

150
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.350
Fuck you.

151
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.270
You motherfucker.

152
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.610
Put your hands behind the chair.

153
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.190
Sarai.

154
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.130
Get out of the bathroom.

155
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.030
Come here.

156
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.210
Did you tell him Javier
had you whenever he wanted?

157
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.550
What?

158
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.790
Don't feel sorry for her. 
He treats this bitch better than me, his own sister.

159
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.170
Isn't it

160
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.030
There is a drawstring in
the bag. Take it out.

161
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.450
Tie her up.

162
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.750
Lidia asked about you. 
Will be punished.

163
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.450
But you already knew that. 
Right Sarai What?

164
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.350
I don't care what happens to her.

165
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.030
I don't think I would go back there.

166
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.030
Carefully.

167
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.810
Well. Get away from her.

168
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.010
Tell Javier I'll call
you back when I want.

169
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.030
Let's go.

170
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.490
Come back, you bastard. You're dead!

171
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.450
Can you hear me?!

172
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.030
Dead!

173
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.470
Will you never tell me your name?

174
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.290
Victor.

175
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.030
Where are you from, victor?

176
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.030
Finish your meal.

177
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.310
You know my name; you
know where I come from.

178
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.030
Why don't you talk

179
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.890
You can at least tell
me where you are from.

180
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.730
I was born in Cuba.

181
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.370
I have a younger brother. 
My mother is Mexican and mine was Cuban.

182
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.530
- Was he? 
- Dead.

183
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.250
This was my first murder.

184
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.430
Did you kill your father?

185
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.030
- why? 
- I think you know enough about me.

186
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.030
I have to go to the toilet.

187
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.750
Seriously? Will you stand in the toilet?

188
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.990
Either with me or not at all.

189
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.410
Do not go out.

190
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.110
What happened?

191
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.030
They came for you.

192
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.030
Let's go.

193
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.090
Do you want a new car?

194
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.430
They are all dead.

195
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.230
Bastard. What are we going to do now?

196
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.550
Lidia.

197
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.030
What is this place?

198
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.030
We will spend the night here.

199
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.030
This place is safe.

200
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.190
So, if you want
you can take a shower.

201
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.050
Victor.

202
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.070
I'd rather you didn't
call me by my name.

203
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.030
Forget about it.

204
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.390
Can you explain what you did to me, Victor? 
The girl was not part of the contract.

205
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.510
Guzman's daughter was at home.

206
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.490
- Are you sure it's her? 
- I'm sure.

207
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:50.210
I talked to Javier. 
I negotiated with him and accepted 50% of the money as they asked.

208
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.570
What did Javier offer you for killing Guzman?

209
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.150
It's not even part of what Guzman offered
me to kill Javier and get his daughter back.

210
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.050
Everything has changed.

211
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.170
Plan, contract, your orders. Everything.

212
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.330
What are my new orders?

213
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:09.030
Vonegat is waiting for contact. 
Your new orders will depend on the information I receive from you today.

214
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.210
The girl will be useful, Nicolas.

215
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.970
It's important to Javier.

216
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.330
Are you telling me you want
to exchange a girl for Guzman's daughter?

217
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.810
If there is no other way, then yes. 
Now tell Vonegat that everything is under control.

218
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.750
I pass. Another thing. 
Javier sent something to watch.

219
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.150
What did you watch?

220
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.170
Turn around.

221
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.370
Why?

222
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.610
No!

223
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.830
- Victor, please. Stop it ... Victor! 
- I'm sorry.

224
00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.430
So, don't do it.

225
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.330
Get some sleep

226
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.770
What is the password?

227
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.370
- You don't want to know what's inside. 
- Give me the password!

228
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.030
6, 8 ...

229
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.030
Lowercase letter k. 3.

230
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.170
0.

231
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.970
5. Capital letter R.

232
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.750
W. 6.

233
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.090
5.

234
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.090
I'll tell you one last time. 
You don't want to see it.

235
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.710
It's for you, Sarai. 
If you don't come, say goodbye to your friend!

236
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.030
- Stop crying! 
- Shut up!

237
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.530
- Nicolas. 
- I've got Javier on the line. You can talk?

238
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.110
Yes.

239
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.490
You will die because of what you did.

240
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.310
Sarai should be given to me
as soon as you found her.

241
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.430
What happened is done, Javier. 
What made you contact me?

242
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.230
I want Guzman to be
dead for the price we agreed.

243
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.910
But I'll give you a
million more if you kill Sarai.

244
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.970
- Why do you want her dead? 
- We've already talked about this. You and me.

245
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.030
The reasons are not
very important in this business.

246
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:42.490
Well. Let it be that way. 
You will bring me Lidia and Guzman's daughter in exchange for Sarai.

247
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.030
I will kill Guzman later and
give you both if you pay me.

248
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.030
Guzman's daughter?

249
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.070
Yes.

250
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.390
And I thought all the time
that he wanted to kill me.

251
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.390
You are good, I admit.

252
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.530
You get two contracts at once.

253
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.530
You show Guzman his daughter,
you take money for it.

254
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.270
You kill him and then collect the
money I give you for his head.

255
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.730
- We have a deal or not? 
- So, you won't kill Sarai.

256
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.590
Not yet.

257
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.030
She is my only guarantee.

258
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.530
When I return it to you, you
can do whatever you want with it.

259
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:21.750
Fine. I will take care of everything
so that it can be done today.

260
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.390
Wake up. Let's go.

261
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.030
Will you take me to Lidia?

262
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.370
Not now.

263
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.070
I don't care what happens to
me, you have to give me back.

264
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.190
I don't think it
would be best for you.

265
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.310
You have to take me, Victor. 
He will kill her!

266
00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.830
- Sarai, the plan has changed. 
- No! You must take me.

267
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.030
Do not understand. 
Only I can help her.

268
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.330
- I'll leave with you or without you. 
- You'll leave when I decide.

269
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.630
Now get dressed.

270
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.130
Won't you tie my hands?

271
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.030
What if I run away?

272
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.670
The only one who knows the
way to Javier's house is me.

273
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.430
Now go or stay.

274
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.010
Why does Javier want you dead?

275
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.510
What?

276
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.030
Did he tell you
he wanted to kill me?

277
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.030
He offered me a
million dollars to do this.

278
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.030
Why?

279
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.030
No, I do not know.

280
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.230
Do you know.

281
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.030
Consider.

282
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.550
I don't ... I don't know, Victor.

283
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.270
I do not understand.

284
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.790
I always knew he was
crazy ... and obsessed with me.

285
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.530
And he protected me from
everything he did to other girls.

286
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.030
Did he protect you?

287
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.230
Yes.

288
00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.030
He didn't let his people touch me.

289
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.050
Even his sister.

290
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.030
And he never left me alone.

291
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.250
Even when he traveled and was on a plane, 
I flew with him.

292
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.410
I felt like some ... trophy.

293
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.810
And that's exactly what you are.

294
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.550
Where did he take you?

295
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.290
It looked like holiday homes.

296
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:37.250
I do not know. 
He used to say that I would meet new people, but I knew they were drug deals and trafficking in women.

297
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.390
Sometimes we would come
back with a new girlfriend.

298
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.710
Do you remember the
names of people you met?

299
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.610
No.

300
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.030
Not now.

301
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.230
What is going on?

302
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.850
You know too much.

303
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:10.010
You are a living and free threat not
only to Javier, but to his entire organization.

304
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.030
Are you going to kill me?

305
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.030
If that was my intention, 
I would already do it.

306
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.530
Why don't you do that

307
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.030
Will you use me as a guarantee?

308
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.690
In a way - yes.

309
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.030
But I don't kill innocent people either.

310
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.030
I am not innocent.

311
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.730
Nobody is innocent.

312
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.650
For years, I let this bastard rape me.

313
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.450
I never did anything.

314
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.030
I stayed there.

315
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.590
Looking at everything.

316
00:34:55.030 --> 00:35:03.610
Watching his people and his bitch
sister rape, torture and sell girls.

317
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:12.030
Carmen's hands were crushed with a hammer.

318
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:18.230
And Marisol forced them to have an abortion.

319
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.190
And they left her to die bleeding ...

320
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.890
On the table. With
her child by her side.

321
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:32.770
And Karen? She was killed because she didn't
like the man who was supposed to buy her.

322
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.550
And I just stood there.

323
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.030
And I did nothing.

324
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.030
Never.

325
00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.010
I never did anything.

326
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.210
You did.

327
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.390
Despite everything you saw,
you managed to remain calm.

328
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.270
And wait for your chance.

329
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.350
Even today you risk your
life because of a friend.

330
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.930
You are innocent.

331
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.330
Otherwise you wouldn't be alive.

332
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.630
Do not move.

333
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.530
All is ready.

334
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.950
Can you explain to
me what are you doing?

335
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.150
- It's negotiation ... 
- What are the new orders?

336
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.230
Still nothing.

337
00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.510
But you don't have the freedom to contract.

338
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.470
- You just have to fill them in. 
- I'm just trying to get the benefit, Nicolas.

339
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.410
Vonegat should believe me...

340
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.430
Could you do me a favor?

341
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:53.750
As a brother.

342
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.970
Not as my contact.

343
00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.450
When did I refuse you?

344
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.430
Sarai, this is Nicolas.

345
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.590
You will go with him in his car.

346
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.350
Do not be afraid.

347
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.190
He won't hurt you.

348
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.210
What will happen now?

349
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.290
We'll meet with Javier. 
She'll tell us your friend.

350
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.070
Will you exchange me for Lidia?

351
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.330
That was the deal.

352
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.890
If that's what I have
to do, I'll do it.

353
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.310
Promise me that nothing will happen to Lidia.

354
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.430
Promise me.

355
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.890
You have become a real attraction.

356
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.030
I never wanted to bother you or Victor.

357
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.670
I will explain one thing to you.

358
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.430
Everything Victor does is for
the good of the "Order".

359
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.390
Not for you.

360
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:24.590
- Javier's coward didn't come. 
- I would say he is not stupid.

361
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.290
Hide.

362
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.190
- What about Javier? 
- He won't come.

363
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.830
That's her! Lidia!

364
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.830
Damn it, don't panic! Hide!

365
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.310
I said two.

366
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.330
Cordelia.

367
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.550
What is she doing here?

368
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.710
Excuse me. Look at me.

369
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.630
Everything will be fine.

370
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.590
It will be fine.

371
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.650
Can I know what you did?

372
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.030
You risk everything.

373
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:06.030
Everything. Contacts with the Order, relations
with Vonegat, my life, my life.

374
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.030
You've become unstable, Victor.

375
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.030
And you know better than anyone what to do in this case. 
You know perfectly well.

376
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:15.030
You will tell Vonegat that
they were the first to shoot.

377
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.350
And you will tell Guzman that Javier did
not show up, but the work will be done.

378
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.890
As always, I will tell
them what you tell me.

379
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.510
But tell me one thing ... 
Is it related to what happened in Budapest?

380
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.410
I have nothing to say about it.

381
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:15.610
- Is everything I asked you ready? 
- Everything is ready. 
They are waiting for you.

382
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.590
Wash yourself in the toilet.

383
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.030
From now on you are Isabel.

384
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.430
How is that

385
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.650
The place where we go is safe,
but no one needs to know your name.

386
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.750
Even the woman who will welcome us.

387
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.030
Who is this woman?

388
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.030
It's safe contact.

389
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.030
If safe, why should we lie to her?

390
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.030
It's under security.

391
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:59.490
When someone is wanted by powerful
people, anyone can give them information.

392
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.550
Will you share the same bed? 
I can give separate for each of you.

393
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.790
It will not be necessary. 
I will not sleep here.

394
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.590
Then make yourself at home.

395
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.170
Victor, you know where to find me.

396
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.030
Why are we here?

397
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.490
You will stay here until I remove Javier.

398
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:30.310
I'd rather go with you.

399
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.630
No Sarai You will stay here.

400
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.730
You shouldn't risk your life all the time.

401
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.010
If you want to feel more comfortable,
there are new clothes in the wardrobe.

402
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.850
This should be your size.

403
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:04.030
Trust me...

404
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.850
Javier will kill us both.

405
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:36.830
Ready.

406
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:37.750
Thank you.

407
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.790
The girl you came with ... Isabel.

408
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:45.030
Of course, we both know that
this is not her real name.

409
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.030
What are you doing with her?

410
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.810
He's with me until I eliminate Javier.

411
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.730
Then she will have
to deal with it herself.

412
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.030
I can't believe that that's all.

413
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:58.770
You want to protect her. To be killed.

414
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.630
Or both.

415
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.030
You're leaving?

416
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.750
Yes.

417
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.450
You will come back?

418
00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.030
I don't think that's a good idea.

419
00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.650
When I kill Javier, 
Samantha will take you wherever you want.

420
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.750
Or I'll send Nicolas for you.

421
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:53.870
And what if others find out? 
Not only Javier can look for me.

422
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:22.090
Victor ...

423
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.630
I'm afraid I won't see you anymore.

424
00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:49.530
Nicolas.

425
00:51:58.650 --> 00:51:59.690
What time

426
00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:12.030
Good day.

427
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:15.470
- Good morning, do you want a coffee? 
- Yes please.

428
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:21.870
I'm sure he knows how grateful
you are to him for his help.

429
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.030
Can you tell me something about him?

430
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.450
All I know is what
he told me about himself.

431
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.650
So what?

432
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.170
Well not much. 
Nobody knows too much about him.

433
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:41.030
I suppose it is not a mistake to
tell you that he is a reserved man.

434
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.030
He loves his Cuban coffee.

435
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.030
Mexican food.

436
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.030
Since when has he been like this?

437
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:50.210
Always.

438
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:56.970
From an early age he was raised
by assassins and was trained to kill.

439
00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.410
He believes in nothing and trusts no one.

440
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:02.130
Everything he does is thought out.

441
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.410
Nothing is accidental.

442
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.410
He told me that the first
person he killed was his father.

443
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.650
Is it true?

444
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.510
If he told you this
just because you would stop asking.

445
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:34.030
What are you doing? Come here. Fast.

446
00:53:55.210 --> 00:54:00.030
I have four bullets in this gun. 
I'll fire them every two minutes.

447
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:03.110
- Unless Sarai appears. 
- Victor is on his way.

448
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:07.030
You're lying. You smell a lie.

449
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.150
Check the house.

450
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.390
Find her!

451
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.890
Victor was here.

452
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.110
With a girl named Isabel. 
But he took her with him.

453
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.490
I know she is here.

454
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.950
I know she didn't go
with him because I watched him.

455
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:47.650
You have 6 minutes left. 
The last bullet will hit the brain.

456
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.030
Did you hear that, Sarai?!

457
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.690
Six more minutes and I'll kill her. 
It will happen the same as with Lidia.

458
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.030
I just want to take you home, honey.

459
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:05.310
I would never hurt you.

460
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.290
I told you nobody was here.

461
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:20.530
Bastard.

462
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.530
Time is running out, Sarai!

463
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.570
Samantha, are you okay?

464
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.430
Come here, come here ... Come here ...

465
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.430
What happened? 
Were you not happy

466
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:46.430
Why didn't you tell me
I would do anything for you.

467
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.250
Let me look at you.

468
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.450
Did you have sex with him?

469
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:58.030
Did you make love to him

470
00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.030
Are you still mine

471
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.550
I will always be yours.

472
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:08.250
Donâ€™t lie to me.

473
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:12.030
You don't know what you did to me. 
You shouldn't leave.

474
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.450
I am ready to go home.

475
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:26.330
You killed her.

476
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.930
That's right

477
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.650
Your boyfriend has arrived.

478
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.090
Sarai ...

479
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.030
We have to go.

480
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.570
Everything will be fine.

481
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:35.090
Let's go. Let's go ...

482
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.170
I haven't seen you in
church for a long time.

483
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:33.450
Do you think God will
forgive you everything you did?

484
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:42.350
I did not come to ask for forgiveness.

485
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.030
And so? What are we doing here?

486
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.150
Sit down, we need to talk.

487
00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:59.770
Do you remember the mission in Budapest?

488
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:03.170
It never was.

489
00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:07.730
I actually went to meet our father.

490
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:09.890
He sent for me.

491
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:15.150
A year ago.

492
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:19.710
Your mother was killed because
she disclosed information about the Order.

493
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:20.930
But you already know that.

494
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:26.030
Then the Order couldn't trust you.

495
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:30.030
Vonegat thought you might want to
avenge her death at any time.

496
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.730
They gave me an order to remove you.

497
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.990
Our father agreed.

498
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.130
Why didn't you do that? What?

499
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.030
Why am I still alive?

500
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.770
You were the only
order I couldn't carry out.

501
00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.230
Then our father decided to do it.

502
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:02.430
He told me that the only way to
stop you is to get rid of you.

503
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.230
So, I shot him.

504
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:23.030
Then I convinced Vonegat
that he could trust you.

505
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.270
Why are you telling me this now?

506
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.610
I think you should know
the truth before you die.

507
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.050
What are you talking about?

508
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.950
Don't fuck with me, Nicolas.

509
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.050
Only 2 people knew our
location - you and Samantha.

510
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.630
Why don't you ask her?

511
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.070
Samantha gave her life for Sarai.

512
01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:00.430
You can't do it.

513
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.550
I can't do it?

514
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.030
Why did you cheat on me?

515
01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.850
- I never cheated on you. 
- Why?! 
- I never cheated on you!

516
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.670
I swear on my life, 
I'm your brother.

517
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.970
I'll die before I betray you!

518
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.030
I told you not to leave.

519
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.370
- You told me he was dead. 
- I lied.

520
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:28.790
Who ...? Who is cheating on whom?

521
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.030
Kill me.

522
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:38.750
Kill me please.

523
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.650
I will not beg for my life.

524
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.350
If you want to kill me, do it!

525
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:50.030
But you should know that
I've never, never cheated on you!

526
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.430
Victor, Victor, Victor ... Look
at me. Look at me.

527
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:09.570
Look at me...

528
01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:12.490
Why ... Why do you trust her?

529
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.630
It all started because of her!

530
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.730
She brought Javier!

531
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:19.710
It was her ...

532
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.050
Victor, it wasn't me.

533
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.030
Take off clothes.

534
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:49.490
For what?

535
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.550
Remove them.

536
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:09.890
Everything.

537
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:40.830
What are you doing?

538
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.330
Trust me.

539
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.530
Do not move.

540
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.650
Get dressed.

541
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.170
Do you recognize it?

542
01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:58.670
It's the same chip that
was found in the Dubai girls.

543
01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:00.330
Bought by Hamburg.

544
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:03.870
Javier was more involved than we thought.

545
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.030
Get rid of him.

546
01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.310
I'll do it.

547
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.510
For starters, where should I take you?

548
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.210
Soon I will get new orders
and I won't have time for it.

549
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.570
I want to stay with you.

550
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:58.330
Victor, I could help you. 
Have you ever trained someone to be like you?

551
01:06:58.330 --> 01:06:59.830
I will do what you do.

552
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:03.530
No and I will never do it.

553
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.070
Why?

554
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:06.790
Why not?

555
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:15.810
I have nowhere to go. 
I have no family, not even friends.

556
01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.790
I don't even have an identity.

557
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:27.030
Sarai ... You'll have everything you need.

558
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:32.030
Money, new identity, new life.

559
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.570
I will personally take care
of it; you will have nothing.

560
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:37.450
I don't want you to help
me in a life I don't want.

561
01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:39.550
You just don't want to be alone.

562
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.530
Live freely, make your own decisions.

563
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:47.810
Sleep with whoever you choose. 
Lead a normal life because you don't know him.

564
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:53.090
But if I wanted you to kill someone as
part of a task, you wouldn't have done it.

565
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:56.630
You couldn't kill someone without
knowing why you kill him.

566
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.810
You'll never be like me.

567
01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:03.990
We leave at six.

568
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.090
I hope you think about where
you want me to take you.

569
01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:48.390
You shouldn't be here.

570
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.070
I know exactly where I want to be.

571
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:57.110
Sarai ...

572
01:08:58.030 --> 01:09:00.490
- This can't happen. 
- Yes, it can happen.

573
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.870
I've never been with the man I want.

574
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:06.590
I want to be with you.

575
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.370
For once, I want
to have control over someone.

576
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.990
I can teach you if you want to.

577
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:32.830
Despite my fear, 
I wanted to be exactly where I was.

578
01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:35.270
Trapped in the arms of a murderer.

579
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.010
Why didn't we start
earlier as you told me?

580
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.650
I thought you needed more rest.

581
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.030
Thank you.

582
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:57.010
You play the piano great.

583
01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:01.450
You never wanted to do it professionally?

584
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.670
When I was a little girl,
but now I play for myself.

585
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:12.030
Can you promise me something? 
Play sometimes for me too.

586
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.730
- I do not understand. 
- Flight is in an hour.

587
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:20.030
There are new clothes in the bags.

588
01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:21.430
Hurry up.

589
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:35.030
Your name is Isabel Sifred. 
You are a confident woman.

590
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:37.330
Strong. With an unbending personality.

591
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.210
You have to do everything
I ask you to do.

592
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:43.230
It can be a
matter of life or death.

593
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:45.650
I am not and I
will not be your hero.

594
01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.550
You must understand that you
can die during this task.

595
01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:51.950
Just trust yourself. 
To my instincts.

596
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:55.330
If you want as the
last option, you can trust me.

597
01:12:55.330 --> 01:13:00.350
I agreed to take you on this mission because I
want you to understand that this is not life for you.

598
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:05.030
This man's name is Artur Hamburg.

599
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:09.030
It organizes luxury events in various places.

600
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.390
How do we know where he is?

601
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:13.650
We will be invited.

602
01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.110
Good evening. Welcome.

603
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:38.110
Having fun?

604
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:42.210
We are having a good time.

605
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:43.950
Thank you for the invitation.

606
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:45.870
You are speaking Italian?

607
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:49.170
- I speak seven languages. 
- Really?

608
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:53.790
- Where are you from? 
- I am not from here.

609
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.630
- And Mrs.? 
- She's from Spain.

610
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:01.650
Where from Spain?

611
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:04.630
From Madrid.

612
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.790
- She is yours ... 
- She is my good.

613
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:11.590
She is my property.

614
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.550
Actually ... part of it.

615
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:18.030
And the second part?

616
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:20.570
The second part is independent thinking.

617
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:23.590
I prefer a woman who resists.

618
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:27.230
My Isabel does everything
I ask her to do.

619
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:32.670
Although sometimes he doesn't want
to keep his mouth shut.

620
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:43.850
I would like to meet
you in a more intimate place.

621
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:47.290
Fine.

622
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.890
Wonderful, let's go.

623
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:31.570
Check them out.

624
01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.070
Is that necessary?

625
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.170
I'm sorry, honey. 
You have to be careful.

626
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.470
You can go through.

627
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:45.550
Come back in an hour.

628
01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:52.510
Come on. Make yourself comfortable.

629
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.630
Thank you.

630
01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:26.210
Please.

631
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:38.110
I'll tell you what I want.

632
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.370
Let me offer you a price.

633
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:43.970
What do you want?

634
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.990
I want to watch you.

635
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:50.830
I want to look at what you do.

636
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:53.970
You'll fuck her.

637
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:58.810
And from time to time, you
will do what I tell you.

638
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.030
And then for an additional amount ...

639
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:09.250
... you will look away.

640
01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:14.030
I will not do it.

641
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.030
Well.

642
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:21.230
You will do what I tell you.

643
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:30.250
If you want it, you
can do it before me.

644
01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:33.590
Agreement.

645
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.070
So, health.

646
01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:51.710
Isabel.

647
01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:54.030
Sit down.

648
01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:25.330
Spread her legs.

649
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:32.330
Let him feel you inside.

650
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:35.430
Further...

651
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:49.330
Let him cry.

652
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:51.730
Harder...

653
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:55.610
If you want, I have toys.

654
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:59.730
I don't need toys to make her cry.

655
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.590
But it wouldn't be bad.

656
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.030
I haven't hurt her for so long.

657
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:15.890
Will you do this for my wife too?

658
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:16.750
What?

659
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:22.970
This was not in our contract

660
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.710
But ... we can try.

661
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:29.830
Where she is?

662
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:31.570
He is here. Right over there.

663
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.990
It won't impress you when you see it.

664
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:42.610
She is just like your Isabel. 
Maybe a little more obedient.

665
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:45.750
But you'll like it.

666
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.170
Well.

667
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:06.730
Sarai.

668
01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:13.410
There's a gun and an envelope
in the top drawer, take them out.

669
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:19.610
Give me a gun.

670
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:27.730
No, I am begging you I will give you a lot of money. 
As many as you like, but don't kill me ...

671
01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:30.570
There's a letter in
the envelope, take it out.

672
01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:34.250
Your wife left a letter with a signature.

673
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:37.170
- What are you talking about? 
- Victor, we have to help her.

674
01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:38.890
Forget about her, read the letter.

675
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.290
"My dear husband, 
I can't live with you like that anymore."

676
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:46.490
'' We embarrass our
family, our children, ourselves. ''

677
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:50.370
'' I can't live like this anymore, 
I feel powerless. 
I'm sorry I didn't ask for your help ... ''

678
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:53.610
'' But I just wanted to finish it all. 
And that's what I do. ''

679
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:56.730
'' I'm done with all this.
Goodbye Artur. Your wife, Mary. ''

680
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:59.590
No ... Tell me why you came.

681
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:02.430
The envelope has a memory
card, give it to me.

682
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:08.210
Listen to me well.

683
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:11.570
All information on it will
be forwarded to my boss.

684
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:14.170
Your customers, your bank accounts ...

685
01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:17.310
Including the movies that your
wife made without your knowledge.

686
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:20.510
If you don't report her death
as suicide, we'll come for you.

687
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:22.930
All this information will
go directly to the FBI.

688
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:48.030
No no.

689
01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:51.030
No, I'm begging you ...

690
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:52.830
- Please. 
- Do not move.

691
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.030
I beg you.

692
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:57.770
Recently you wanted your wife to watch it.

693
01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:01.670
And now your wife would
like you to watch it.

694
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:10.030
Please please...

695
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:13.910
No! No!

696
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:20.970
You son of a bitch ...

697
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.370
I'm sorry, Hamburg.

698
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:47.630
You have an hour.

699
01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.790
Make up a story.

700
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:04.250
Breathe.

701
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:53.870
Victor Faust!

702
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:06.490
It was a pleasure.

703
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.310
See you soon.

704
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.950
Soon.

705
01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:32.870
You said you don't kill innocent people.

706
01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:35.390
She was innocent.

707
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.170
She was the target.

708
01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:42.030
Mery Hamburg organized her death.

709
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.270
They were both involved in rapes and murders.

710
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.710
A year ago, she
tried to give up everything.

711
01:26:55.655 --> 01:26:57.271
But Hamburg wouldn't let her.

712
01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.485
He made her addicted to heroin.

713
01:27:01.639 --> 01:27:03.793
And he locked it
in that room ever since.

714
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:09.210
Do you think they'll be looking for us?

715
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:12.290
I do not think so.

716
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:15.790
Hamburg has a lot to lose.

717
01:27:17.651 --> 01:27:19.582
Hamburg has to pay for everything he did.

718
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:22.210
Just like her.

719
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:26.470
Sooner or later someone will order his murder.

720
01:27:39.936 --> 01:27:46.161
If Hamburg hadn't opened the room door in
time, would you fuck me in front of him?

721
01:27:52.614 --> 01:27:53.528
Of course not.

722
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.890
But you wanted it.

723
01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:11.350
Yes.

724
01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.729
But this is not the place.

725
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:16.150
Not in these circumstances.

726
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:21.510
Do you still want

727
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.710
What happened, Nicolas?

728
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:32.830
Vonegat has just posted a new quest. 
It's here in town.

729
01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:33.710
Location?

730
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:37.570
I just sent you all the
information you need. 9:00 in the morning.

731
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:39.030
It's less than an hour.

732
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:42.330
Enough time. Let me know when it's over.

733
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:03.550
Victor?

734
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:05.910
Nicolas here, open it!

735
01:32:15.345 --> 01:32:16.596
Victor sent me for you.

736
01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:18.174
Where is he?

737
01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:24.343
He's on a mission. 
But don't worry, you'll meet at the airport in the afternoon.

738
01:32:28.065 --> 01:32:28.775
What are you doing?

739
01:32:29.561 --> 01:32:31.400
What are you doing? Don't do it, 
I'm staying here.

740
01:32:31.441 --> 01:32:34.760
- I'm trying to protect my brother. 
- I know. And you are absolutely right. I'm only...

741
01:32:34.785 --> 01:32:38.747
They will kill him! 
When the Order finds out what it has done for you, it's only a matter of time.

742
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:43.381
Victor, don't do this.

743
01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:45.865
He is your brother.

744
01:35:21.944 --> 01:35:23.498
How long have I been sleeping?

745
01:35:24.835 --> 01:35:25.764
Three days.

746
01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:29.052
No.

747
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:41.030
Here's everything you need for a new life.

748
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.790
You're leaving?

749
01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:48.970
Yes.

750
01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:37.550
ONE YEAR LATER

751
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:43.930
Victor Faust has done much more
than free me from abuse and slavery.

752
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:45.310
He changed me.

753
01:36:46.132 --> 01:36:48.283
He made me feel real emotions.

754
01:36:48.681 --> 01:36:49.642
Set me free

755
01:36:50.796 --> 01:36:52.898
There is no day that
I don't think about him.

756
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.171
Or about a life I
could live thanks to his help.

757
01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.946
But this is the life I have chosen.

758
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.415
With or without Victor.

759
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:03.728
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

760
01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:05.564
I have a meeting with Arthur Hamburg.

761
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:06.810
Your name please.

762
01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:08.490
Isabel Sajfred.

763
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:27.470
