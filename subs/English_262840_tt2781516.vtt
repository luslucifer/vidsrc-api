00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:05.344
Ah fuck!

2
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:43.106
<i>Good morning Woodhaven.</i>

3
00:02:43.107 --> 00:02:45.802
<i>This is WCK, I'm Bob</i>

4
00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:49.897
<i>I'm Dan, and we are BAD Radio.
B-A-D Radio.</i>


5
00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:52.490
<i>The clock is tick-tick-ticking
down to you know what.</i>


6
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:55.488
<i>The world famous
Drink n Shoot.</i>


7
00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.697
<i>Don't you judge me.</i>

8
00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:58.519
<i>Looks like some people
might have started early.</i>


9
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.356
<i>We're still getting daily reports
about missing dogs and cats.</i>


10
00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:04.032
<i>I'm not pointing any fingers</i>

11
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.871
<i>No, but I'd avoid eating the
hotdogs they're showing on me.</i>


12
00:03:06.872 --> 00:03:09.480
<i>And I'd avoid those
pork stores anyway.</i>


13
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.593
<i>You know what I've heard Dan?</i>

14
00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:12.370
<i>People are certainly
scared to getting eaten</i>


15
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.869
<i>by the infamous
Woodhaven walking bear.</i>


16
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.871
<i>- Be a bear is on the attack.
- We were.</i>


17
00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.636
<i>Mayor Bradley is looking
like the election frontrunner.</i>


18
00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:22.598
<i>So will it be golden
boy Terry Wallace or</i>


19
00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.576
<i>returning heavyweight Mayor Bradley.</i>

20
00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:28.266
<i>Who has what it takes
to clean up this town.</i>


21
00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:32.468
<i>Not enough mayors in the world to
help our Woodhaven Sheriff Department.</i>


22
00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.809
<i>Speaking of which eclipse morning
radio is of course brought to you by</i>


23
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.999
<i>Liquor Doughnuts.</i>

24
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.015
<i>Liquor Doughnuts,
what more could you ask for?</i>


25
00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.543
Where is he?

26
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:10.109
- I'm right here, genius.
- Chief, I was just about to...


27
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.146
Save your bullshit, Lou.

28
00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:13.180
I could smell you the moment
you pulled into the station.


29
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:14.355
Fuck!

30
00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.420
Tina should have been off
night watch, what, 2 hours ago?


31
00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:21.154
Get an update from her.

32
00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:28.244
- What's up his ass?
- They hit Munro's gas station last night.


33
00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:32.460
- Who?
- P.D's.


34
00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:39.596
Sergeant Tina Wash.

35
00:04:39.597 --> 00:04:42.992
<i>- Hey, this is Willie Higens.
- Willie.  You again.</i>


36
00:04:42.993 --> 00:04:45.099
Yeah ah.
Slow down.


37
00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:49.439
Okay.
I got it.


38
00:04:55.527 --> 00:05:00.187
Disturbance call.
Your boyfriend Willie Higens.


39
00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:04.186
You think you can get this one?

40
00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:24.891
Willie!

41
00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.620
- What is it this time?
- Shhhh.


42
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.821
Won't you come around back?

43
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:44.707
Officer.
Let me show you.


44
00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.213
- Please tell me this is Bigfoot sex tape.
- No.


45
00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:53.419
Do you believe in the occult, Lou?

46
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.288
Because I think I know
what's been happening


47
00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.790
to all the missing
pets around town.


48
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.992
Jesus Christ?

49
00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:06.531
Teenagers.
They've been sacrificing them to Satan.


50
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.415
God knows why, I don't know.  I assume
they've doing some kinky sexual stuff.


51
00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:13.086
But they've been creeping around
in the bushes out back all week.


52
00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:20.730
<i>I'm here in the woods.</i>

53
00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:23.320
<i>I know this is dark,
I mean come along.</i>


54
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:26.798
<i>- Look! Here!
- There's the mark of the beast.</i>


55
00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.048
Proof.

56
00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:30.825
So I'm going to give you an AK-47,
I'm going to take an M-16.


57
00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:32.894
- We're going to fire on those kids...
- Have anything in heavy metal?


58
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:36.239
Like lead... mercury?

59
00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:41.827
- No.
- Oh my God.


60
00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:46.177
Been a slice.
But I have other police work to do.


61
00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:51.473
This is real, Lou.  You gonna see
an eye when I do is citizen arrest


62
00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.409
on a teenager with a fucking shotgun.

63
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.040
Remember what happened to
the boy that cried wolf, Willie.


64
00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.710
Nothing happened to him.
But that town's flock was fucked.


65
00:07:04.147 --> 00:07:06.135
Town's flock was fucked.

66
00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:12.217
<i>Lou, come in.
You there?  Over.</i>


67
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.581
Go ahead.

68
00:07:14.857 --> 00:07:17.138
<i>How did that thing go with Higens?</i>

69
00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.635
Ah, a bunch of kids
partying in the woods.


70
00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:22.375
Following up a possible lead now.

71
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:39.285
Your usual.

72
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.723
Stocking up for the Drink n Shoot?

73
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.343
Thanks to our forefathers, in two days,
this bar will be full of drunk hunters.


74
00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:53.766
That's what we need.  Bunch of
drunks with guns running around.


75
00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:00.013
Very funny.  I'll have you know
I haven't fired mine in years.


76
00:08:00.014 --> 00:08:01.712
Are you sure you
still know how to use it?


77
00:08:02.468 --> 00:08:07.699
Jess, whiskey for my boys
and water for my horses.


78
00:08:14.272 --> 00:08:15.737
Deputy.

79
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:23.025
Keeping the streets safe I see.

80
00:08:25.628 --> 00:08:27.459
Come on.
Beat it!


81
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.624
It's time for a change, Woodhaven.

82
00:08:34.254 --> 00:08:39.169
It's time to take on those who run
this town with the drugs and corruption.


83
00:08:41.713 --> 00:08:46.873
Our local law enforcement has done nothing
for generations, and Mayor Bradley,


84
00:08:46.908 --> 00:08:50.641
she's more concerned with selling
this town than with running it.


85
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.228
It's time we clean up Woodhaven,

86
00:08:54.229 --> 00:08:59.289
and a vote for Wallace
is a vote for change.


87
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.339
Vote for Wallace!

88
00:09:14.008 --> 00:09:19.929
Number 1, number 2, 3, 4...

89
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.326
Hello!
Hello.


90
00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:33.046
- Did you find anything?
- Anything?


91
00:09:33.047 --> 00:09:38.060
- The disturbance calls.
- Just some kids partying in the bush.


92
00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:43.079
Well.  Seems like they're at it again.
We just got another complain.


93
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.834
Maybe you could catch him
in the act for a change.


94
00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:48.690
Well, I just started my shift.
I could take it.


95
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:52.297
No, Mr Phinias will be here.
He can deal with it.  There you go.


96
00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:56.744
Maybe try getting off your
bar-stool this time.  Just this once.


97
00:11:05.238 --> 00:11:07.771
Party's over!
Pack it up!


98
00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:23.255
Save you the pay for work.
Go the fuck home.


99
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.704
Aaargh!

100
00:11:58.552 --> 00:11:59.958
What the hell?

101
00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:06.282
- You!
- Behind you.


102
00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:33.538
- Hello.
- You're awake?  I'm impressed.


103
00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:37.374
- Who's this coming in?  What's up?
- Well, there's been an incident.


104
00:14:11.994 --> 00:14:16.702
- Hey!  Don't do that.
- Or what?


105
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.781
You forget to shave?

106
00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.030
Follow me.

107
00:15:17.212 --> 00:15:19.167
Yeah.  Terry Wallace.

108
00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:22.777
Mayoral race just got a
whole lot easier to call.


109
00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:33.495
Hello.  Did you see anything
suspicious last night?


110
00:15:33.837 --> 00:15:36.821
Just didn't peg Terry for a junkie.

111
00:15:36.863 --> 00:15:39.993
Yeah, sometimes people wear
different face in public.


112
00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:44.347
Especially politicians.
It's a shame.  He had my vote.


113
00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:51.882
Ahh.  Thank you.
Here we go.


114
00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:54.449
Well, that's why I want to try **.

115
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.074
Hunter found him this morning.
Called it in.


116
00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:59.384
Looks like he called
the whole town too.


117
00:16:02.986 --> 00:16:03.957
Fuck!

118
00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.662
I never saw Terry
as much of a hunter.


119
00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:11.892
What about the neck wound?

120
00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:15.505
I imagine the critter
got to him last night.


121
00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:17.662
Keep your eye open
for a stoned coyote.


122
00:16:17.863 --> 00:16:21.019
Well, I mean is it an
attack or or is it an OD?


123
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.351
Terms of cause of death, I'm leaning
towards an OD but I'll need an autopsy.


124
00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.100
All right now, Terry is
a well known figure so


125
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:31.585
we keep this quiet until we
got all the facts, alright?


126
00:16:34.517 --> 00:16:37.164
Mayor, was this an animal attack?

127
00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:40.665
Well, of course we can't comment
on all the details at the moment,


128
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:45.085
but, as you know
it is our top priority.


129
00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.877
How will this impact the festival?

130
00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:50.449
Well, I think in the
wake of this tragedy,


131
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.305
the Drink n Shoot is going
to have to be canceled.


132
00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:55.506
<i>Oh no!</i>

133
00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:23.733
- What is it Tina?
- How do you know it was me?


134
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:26.499
- I smelt your perfume.
- I didn't wear any.


135
00:17:29.762 --> 00:17:31.363
You buying this?

136
00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:34.525
Feels oddly familiar, no?

137
00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:38.132
I'm not trying to dredge up the past.
I'm just saying.


138
00:17:38.167 --> 00:17:41.280
When was the last time they
canceled the Drink n' Shoot?


139
00:17:42.631 --> 00:17:45.131
I know where you're going
with this and I'm not biting.


140
00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:46.659
Just saying.

141
00:17:49.181 --> 00:17:51.255
No, shit!

142
00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:05.696
I'm standing in the forest where
locals have gathered for generations


143
00:18:05.697 --> 00:18:09.580
drink in hand to hunt the
mystical Woodhaven beast.


144
00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:14.924
<i>Today, this annual tradition is in
jeopardy due to a gruesome discovery.</i>


145
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.726
To Terry Wallace.

146
00:18:25.494 --> 00:18:27.411
Such a shame about Terry.

147
00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:29.691
This town could have
used some of your blood.


148
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.284
- Wallace certainly got it today.
- Wooh.


149
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.515
Too soon?

150
00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:37.641
You know everyone in town.

151
00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:41.862
Popular, very pretty.
Maybe you should run.


152
00:18:41.863 --> 00:18:44.553
You think I'd give Mayor Bradley
a run for her money?


153
00:18:44.754 --> 00:18:47.887
- You got my vote.
- Mine too.


154
00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:51.562
You don't have to ask.
What's this?


155
00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:55.225
- Police work.
- Really?


156
00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:56.962
What?

157
00:18:56.963 --> 00:19:00.099
I just don't think I've ever seen
you do actual work before.


158
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.404
Well, as Terry normally said,
it's time for a change.


159
00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:13.100
Alright, we're closing early tonight.
Down it or drain it.


160
00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:14.659
What the fuck for?

161
00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:18.987
- Private party.
- What the fuck!


162
00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:22.743
Don't worry, we'll be
here tomorrow, I promise.


163
00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:25.101
Fucking bullshit!

164
00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:30.930
Alright, these will keep you
company while I'm gone.


165
00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:35.958
Friday morning better...
I think you're trying to get me drunk.


166
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:56.540
- Almost done, handsome.
- No rush.


167
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.581
- Everything alright?
- Yeah.  You?


168
00:21:04.682 --> 00:21:09.204
- You want to get out of here?
- That is the best idea I've heard all day.


169
00:21:12.224 --> 00:21:14.756
Whoo!
You alright fella?


170
00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:16.985
Ooh!
Must have eaten something funky.


171
00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:20.676
- Well, let's get you to bed.
- That sounds...


172
00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:26.290
I'll be right back.

173
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.658
What the...

174
00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:41.343
Aaargh!

175
00:22:41.837 --> 00:22:43.064
Eeeargh!

176
00:22:43.354 --> 00:22:46.789
Aaargh!

177
00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:49.722
Aaah!

178
00:24:32.487 --> 00:24:34.798
Oh!  What the fuck!

179
00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:43.933
Jessica!

180
00:24:49.783 --> 00:24:53.263
Morning, Lou Garou.
How's your butt?


181
00:24:53.264 --> 00:24:54.886
Willie, what the hell?

182
00:24:54.887 --> 00:24:59.396
I'm sorry man.  I don't
take cops.  I improvised.


183
00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:01.169
What the hell's gotten into you?

184
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.379
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going to ask you.


185
00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:09.139
Play.

186
00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:18.217
- What are you showing me?
- That's you, Lou.  Last night.


187
00:25:18.766 --> 00:25:21.582
This is Willie.
I just shot Lou Garou.


188
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:25.526
He's a fucking wolf.  I just put

189
00:25:25.527 --> 00:25:30.149
Lou?  Wolf.
Fucking, he's out.


190
00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:37.513
So who's crying wolf now?

191
00:25:38.383 --> 00:25:41.490
Ok ok.  So I washed
your uniform last night.


192
00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:44.940
It was a little dirty dirty,
so I put it in the cold cycle.


193
00:25:45.241 --> 00:25:46.760
A lot of blood.

194
00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:49.602
I'm going to make you some breakfast.

195
00:25:54.418 --> 00:25:57.880
- I think you shrunk it.
- What?  What was that?


196
00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:01.452
Thank you Willie for helping me.
You're welcome.


197
00:26:01.453 --> 00:26:04.173
I could throw you in jail
for kidnapping an officer.


198
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.947
Yeah you could and
I could sell you to science.


199
00:26:06.948 --> 00:26:10.420
- You are a real fucking guy, Willie.
- Thank you.


200
00:26:12.984 --> 00:26:15.759
Now for the secret ingredient.

201
00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:18.436
You thirsty boy?

202
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.183
Have a dog.

203
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:34.025
Man, he likes to party.

204
00:26:47.598 --> 00:26:50.532
- That proves it.
- What the fuck!


205
00:26:50.533 --> 00:26:53.864
Wolfbane!  It was what we call
as vampire wolfbane.  It's the...


206
00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:55.342
Don't say it.

207
00:26:55.343 --> 00:26:58.500
It's what you are. The things got your
fucking senses going into overdrive.


208
00:26:58.601 --> 00:27:03.107
Hey. I want you to listen.  You may or
you may not just start to get your period.


209
00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:07.213
I'm gonna make you some new eggs.

210
00:27:09.483 --> 00:27:12.826
Don't bother.
Tina's coming.


211
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.665
I'll be damned.

212
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.507
Now, last night was the full moon.

213
00:27:25.508 --> 00:27:29.083
So I did some research in
between now and the solar eclipse.


214
00:27:29.184 --> 00:27:31.896
- I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
- For how long?


215
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:34.967
Two days, give or take.

216
00:27:35.567 --> 00:27:38.941
But Lou, we gonna have
to lock you up tonight.


217
00:27:40.131 --> 00:27:42.563
Come by the station at dusk.

218
00:27:46.864 --> 00:27:49.283
Jesus, Lou.  I've been
looking everywhere.


219
00:27:49.284 --> 00:27:51.288
Good morning to you too.
What's your panic?


220
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:54.359
There's been another incident.
Jessica's bar.


221
00:27:58.571 --> 00:28:00.644
Say, how did you
find me anyway?


222
00:28:01.345 --> 00:28:04.593
It might come as a surprise
but I'm a police officer.


223
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:24.494
Lou, you know I've given up
expecting you to be a great cop.


224
00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:28.550
But the least you could do is
be a cop that shows up on time.


225
00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:34.588
Now, I don't know if you're ashamed, but
I do know that your dad sure shit would be.


226
00:28:35.975 --> 00:28:40.441
- Jessie, thank you. We'll keep you posted.
- Well, thank you Ray.


227
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:44.587
Make yourself useful.
See Jessie to her car.


228
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.808
Chief, with all due respect,
between this and Wallace,


229
00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:55.451
I think we're in over our head.  Might
be time to bring someone in from the city.


230
00:28:55.552 --> 00:28:58.241
This stays local.
You understand?


231
00:28:59.978 --> 00:29:03.688
Maybe you could stop trying to do
my job and secure the crime scene.


232
00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:06.655
- Mmm.  How about that?
- Aah.


233
00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:39.662
- Jess, I'm really sorry. I don't know...
- You weren't yourself, Lou.


234
00:29:39.763 --> 00:29:42.841
- You didn't do this.
- Did I hurt you?


235
00:29:42.842 --> 00:29:46.612
No.  No, you saved me.

236
00:29:48.242 --> 00:29:49.800
We'll talk later.

237
00:29:56.542 --> 00:29:57.722
Lou.

238
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.800
That is some gnarly shit.

239
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.832
Don't!

240
00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:38.100
Like a face.

241
00:30:39.043 --> 00:30:40.784
Hey, kind of looks like you.

242
00:30:41.596 --> 00:30:46.529
Oh, sorry I'm late, Chief.
Had to stop by at the Buritt.


243
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.520
Do some investigating.

244
00:30:57.328 --> 00:31:00.966
So if you had to guess,
what happened here?


245
00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:02.880
Two dead man in the bathroom,

246
00:31:03.081 --> 00:31:06.837
if not for the excess of severed flesh,
I would have guessed lovers quarrel.


247
00:31:08.282 --> 00:31:12.550
- Is that animal hair?
- I don't know. What do you think Lou?


248
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:24.213
Look! You've been covering me
a lot lately.  Why don't you take off?


249
00:31:24.214 --> 00:31:25.630
I'll cover the night shift.

250
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:30.303
- Are you drunk?
- That would be nice.


251
00:31:30.304 --> 00:31:34.059
- Nice?
- Yeah.


252
00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:38.294
Okay.

253
00:31:44.654 --> 00:31:47.070
Well, this is nice.

254
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.782
One simple task.

255
00:32:07.504 --> 00:32:09.436
Not to cop out..

256
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:11.396
and blow into me by 10 pm.

257
00:32:11.397 --> 00:32:14.655
- Boss, we tried, but when we got there...
- You were late!


258
00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:20.801
Timing is everything.

259
00:32:21.102 --> 00:32:23.953
It's how the world runs,
it's how...


260
00:32:23.954 --> 00:32:26.186
a business thrives.

261
00:32:27.481 --> 00:32:30.465
Every second is precious.

262
00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:38.369
Cause you see, time... is the
one thing that money can't buy.


263
00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:42.633
- But he wasn't a... He was a...
- A what?


264
00:32:42.634 --> 00:32:44.788
A big fucking wolf.

265
00:32:47.014 --> 00:32:50.693
- A wolf?
- Yeah.  Fucking yeah.


266
00:32:50.694 --> 00:32:55.635
Now are you sure that your
eyes weren't playing tricks on you?


267
00:32:55.836 --> 00:32:58.477
I saw what I
saw with my own eye.

268
00:32:59.833 --> 00:33:02.217
Well, let's see then shall we?

269
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:15.287
Keep your eye on the time.

270
00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:18.575
You dumb fuck!

271
00:34:30.623 --> 00:34:31.911
Hey!

272
00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:35.199
You got any books on devil worship?

273
00:34:39.812 --> 00:34:43.934
- Where did you find this?
- Library.  It's been ... for use.


274
00:34:44.856 --> 00:34:47.923
- The eee like jee, but I don't get this.
- Werewolves.


275
00:34:49.234 --> 00:34:52.630
It says here, werewolves are
created in a baptism of blood.


276
00:34:53.194 --> 00:34:56.609
The sacrifice of an innocent
turns another into a beast.


277
00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:00.581
Yeah, that makes total sense.

278
00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:07.304
According to this, werewolves
are pretty much impossible to kill


279
00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:10.809
during phases of the full moon.
So it's usually a village idiot.


280
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.966
Village idiot?
Hey Lou, this is a book about you.


281
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:20.388
Someone easily contained
leading up to the reckoning.


282
00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:21.624
What the hell is that?

283
00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:24.680
I'm not a werewolf expert, man.
I don't know.


284
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:27.380
The reckoning.
The reason for the ritual.


285
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:29.670
The blood of beast is
drained during the solar eclipse


286
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:31.101
and the wolf is rendered weak.

287
00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:32.830
Who the hell is my werewolf, Bud?

288
00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:35.607
Looks like changeling,
shape-shifters.


289
00:35:35.608 --> 00:35:38.857
Apparently the blood of one werewolf
can maintain their power for decades.


290
00:35:38.858 --> 00:35:42.509
What do they do?
Crystallize it, drink it up like Tang?


291
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.448
Who fucking does that?

292
00:35:46.524 --> 00:35:48.424
What to do think of
myself when I'm a wolf?


293
00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:52.574
I recognise you, man.
Same uniform plus you know...


294
00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.546
You were drunk, so
I knew it was you.  Why?


295
00:35:56.383 --> 00:36:00.778
Well, we found 2 dead men this morning,
ripped to shreds in a bathroom.


296
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.185
And you think that was the hairy you?

297
00:36:04.286 --> 00:36:08.881
Oh, I remember an attack.
Don't remember killing anyone, though.


298
00:36:09.082 --> 00:36:12.105
You did seem like freak.
You're so strong, right?


299
00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:14.911
You had all those...
teeth and those claws.


300
00:36:14.912 --> 00:36:17.465
Plus you got that,
you know, low self esteem,


301
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:20.418
more like you daddy issues,
you now call it,


302
00:36:20.419 --> 00:36:22.299
so you gotta have some rage, right?

303
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.419
That's a lethal combo, man.
I would have killed myself.


304
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.626
But hey, don't worry man.

305
00:36:27.727 --> 00:36:32.641
Horse strength.
Street name: See You in a Fucking Week.


306
00:36:32.642 --> 00:36:35.236
Jesus, Willie, that's
enough to drop a hippo.


307
00:36:35.437 --> 00:36:37.834
That's the plan.
Shit!


308
00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:46.531
- Tweedle dee, tweedle dum.
- Just taking an official noise statement


309
00:36:46.532 --> 00:36:49.550
- on those noise complaints.
- I made it... I means since his arrest.


310
00:36:50.051 --> 00:36:54.958
Okay.  You stay awake now.
You call me if anything comes up.


311
00:36:55.387 --> 00:36:58.410
You bet.
Ah, yes sir.


312
00:36:59.464 --> 00:37:03.296
Fuck!
Christ.


313
00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:26.781
Lou!  I'm so nervous.
Oh, I'm excited and nervous.


314
00:37:26.882 --> 00:37:29.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah.  It's exhilarating.


315
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.957
- Okay. Now, take off your gitch.
- No.


316
00:37:36.058 --> 00:37:39.972
- Yeah, yeah.  Take it off. For science.
- I'm not taking my gitch off, Willie.


317
00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:42.486
Lose your gitch for science.
Lose your gitch.


318
00:37:42.887 --> 00:37:46.861
Okay, turn around, hands
on the wall, bend over...


319
00:37:46.962 --> 00:37:48.765
I'm just...
I'm talking about the...


320
00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:54.231
Now you can, fucking just like
transform right in that spot.


321
00:37:54.332 --> 00:37:56.321
- Really?
- We got a shot.


322
00:37:56.889 --> 00:37:59.131
Take off your gitch.
It's for science, man.


323
00:37:59.132 --> 00:38:01.448
Just forget the gitch.

324
00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:06.915
Hello.
You guys shooting a movie?


325
00:38:07.386 --> 00:38:11.786
What?  No!
It's a science movie.


326
00:38:12.215 --> 00:38:17.153
Lou, can I talk to you for a second.
Alone.


327
00:38:21.226 --> 00:38:23.774
I'll be back in a minute
and forty five seconds.


328
00:38:25.424 --> 00:38:29.364
- What's going on with you?
- What do you mean?


329
00:38:29.365 --> 00:38:33.536
You've gone from lazy to weird.  And
you're spending a lot of time with Willie.


330
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:38.046
- He's helping me.
- Willie, is helping you?


331
00:38:38.347 --> 00:38:41.261
- Okay, well now I'm worried.
- You wouldn't understand.


332
00:38:41.262 --> 00:38:45.479
Wouldn't I?  Willie, you and I
have more in common than not.


333
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.786
You know why I became a cop?

334
00:38:48.757 --> 00:38:50.106
It's a long story.

335
00:38:50.107 --> 00:38:52.746
My dad used to run the bar.
Chesterâ€™s Bar.


336
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.340
He got mixed up in the
wrong crowd, and...


337
00:38:55.741 --> 00:38:59.032
And when he went missing, your dad
was the only one that tried to find him.


338
00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:01.400
- The only one who cared.
- I already know this.


339
00:39:01.401 --> 00:39:04.292
I don't believe your father's
death was an accident.


340
00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:10.476
Anymore than I believe my father was killed
by an animal attack, like Terry Wallace.


341
00:39:11.029 --> 00:39:14.853
I know this town has secrets,
but if you don't want to trust me...


342
00:39:16.207 --> 00:39:19.105
just... be safe.

343
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:28.311
Can I have my shots?
Appreciate your concern.


344
00:39:31.465 --> 00:39:34.968
- Lou, what does she want?
- Nothing.


345
00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:41.004
Okay.
Is it almost... time?


346
00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.694
Sure, you don't want that pill?

347
00:39:42.695 --> 00:39:45.373
It didn't hurt, man.
You just... put it right up.


348
00:39:45.727 --> 00:39:47.963
I should do this sober.

349
00:39:50.428 --> 00:39:51.557
Easy.

350
00:40:12.278 --> 00:40:13.835
Showtime.

351
00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.381
Shit!

352
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.956
It's not recording.

353
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.564
You know, it's like the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen man.


354
00:41:26.565 --> 00:41:29.185
You what?
No, it's beautiful.


355
00:41:30.857 --> 00:41:32.427
Is that a ***?

356
00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:36.331
No, I'm good, I'm done.

357
00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:44.516
Oh!  Okay, okay!

358
00:41:55.662 --> 00:41:56.972
Jesus Christ.

359
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.721
You got to be kidding me.

360
00:42:05.722 --> 00:42:08.952
You want fucking... doughnuts.

361
00:42:14.266 --> 00:42:17.281
I don't even know what it means,
man, because I tell you in that dream


362
00:42:17.282 --> 00:42:20.767
I mean, you look pretty
and it hurt so good.


363
00:42:21.235 --> 00:42:22.522
Go fish.

364
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:29.576
Lou, it's not...
Hey, it's not that you play... fish.


365
00:42:29.677 --> 00:42:32.405
We've been playing for about

366
00:42:32.406 --> 00:42:37.026
Take one card.
Take three card.


367
00:42:37.027 --> 00:42:38.891
Did you... did you get a match?

368
00:42:41.898 --> 00:42:44.973
No, Lou.
Pop your fucking brakes.


369
00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.241
- Lou, this is not a good idea.
- Robbery.


370
00:42:54.403 --> 00:43:00.059
- Lou, you're a wolf.
- Cop!


371
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.420
Last one.
Hurry.


372
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.259
Oh man.
That's some fucking dream.


373
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.899
Shut it!

374
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.859
Drop it!

375
00:43:49.535 --> 00:43:51.543
What the fuck are you?

376
00:43:52.686 --> 00:43:54.483
The voice.

377
00:43:55.363 --> 00:43:57.194
Show yourself.

378
00:43:58.642 --> 00:43:59.898
Fuck!

379
00:44:02.169 --> 00:44:05.013
Get up.
I've got half the guests.


380
00:44:07.692 --> 00:44:10.463
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!


381
00:44:24.236 --> 00:44:26.476
Thank you officer.

382
00:44:34.042 --> 00:44:37.439
Hey Lou, don't forget to murder
someone else on the way to the car.


383
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.413
Low profile man!

384
00:44:43.005 --> 00:44:47.019
Well done, Lou.  That's one more
thing for us to explain now, man.


385
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.696
Why don't you just
go run down the street,


386
00:44:48.697 --> 00:44:50.655
we all talking about
how you act for man.


387
00:44:50.656 --> 00:44:53.786
Could we get out of here, we go home
before you blow down the whole town?


388
00:44:53.787 --> 00:44:54.930
What?

389
00:44:57.891 --> 00:45:01.738
I know what you're
thinking and I approve.


390
00:45:03.218 --> 00:45:04.639
Fuck them!

391
00:46:04.947 --> 00:46:08.208
- Hey Lou.
- You called?


392
00:46:12.034 --> 00:46:15.187
Okay, you pinched you ride,
now what?


393
00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:18.733
Oh, it's that way.

394
00:46:23.149 --> 00:46:24.532
***

395
00:46:26.436 --> 00:46:28.343
Yikes, don't spray!

396
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:33.707
Aargh!

397
00:46:36.819 --> 00:46:39.386
I think you're in too much asparagus.

398
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:42.076
Let's roll.

399
00:46:50.134 --> 00:46:52.493
This is fucking cool!

400
00:46:57.438 --> 00:47:00.047
You got fucking rabies.

401
00:47:10.164 --> 00:47:13.766
- This is still a crime scene.
- You gonna arrest me?


402
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.470
No.  I just have a few
follow up questions.


403
00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:19.511
Well, I have nothing further to add.

404
00:47:21.018 --> 00:47:22.781
How about a drink then?

405
00:47:24.899 --> 00:47:29.297
You know?  I used to sit right
here when I was a little girl.


406
00:47:29.698 --> 00:47:33.374
Drinking Shirley Temples
and watching my dad work.


407
00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:38.419
- Tina here.
- This dispatch.  Attempted robbery


408
00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.423
<i>reported at Liquor & Doughnuts.
Reports are of a gang of pigs and</i>


409
00:47:41.424 --> 00:47:44.117
<i>- and large wolf on the scene.
- What?</i>


410
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:53.175
Cheers.
Bitch!


411
00:48:26.255 --> 00:48:28.571
No one comes in.
Got it?


412
00:48:56.536 --> 00:48:58.443
<i>Chief, come in.
Tina here.</i>


413
00:48:58.544 --> 00:49:02.690
<i>There's been an incident at
Liquor & Doughnuts.  Two dead.  Piggies.</i>


414
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.157
Motherfucker!

415
00:49:18.659 --> 00:49:23.641
Lou, Lou!  Keep your steering wheel
there, man.  We gotta head back.


416
00:49:26.556 --> 00:49:30.775
Hey, what do you smell?
What the fuck are you sniffing?


417
00:49:44.885 --> 00:49:48.197
We're out of road, man!
Think about this, man!


418
00:50:00.514 --> 00:50:02.203
Go on!
Get out of here!


419
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:16.579
Fuck me!

420
00:50:31.774 --> 00:50:33.093
Fucking...

421
00:50:34.932 --> 00:50:37.215
There's gotta be more, sir!

422
00:50:52.395 --> 00:50:53.713
Not again!

423
00:51:08.471 --> 00:51:10.109
Lou!  Watch your back.

424
00:51:22.213 --> 00:51:23.871
That's really bad!

425
00:51:26.942 --> 00:51:30.245
Hey! We got a
really fucking problem.


426
00:51:41.078 --> 00:51:42.248
Lou!

427
00:51:42.647 --> 00:51:45.132
Lab's exploding man.
Let's go.


428
00:51:50.225 --> 00:51:51.978
Let's go, Lou.  Now!

429
00:51:52.062 --> 00:51:54.679
That's a meth.
Come on Lou.


430
00:51:56.459 --> 00:51:57.845
Nice work.

431
00:51:57.846 --> 00:51:59.894
Sorry, really ain't good in fighting.

432
00:51:59.895 --> 00:52:01.920
- Place of work!
- Let's go.


433
00:52:05.616 --> 00:52:09.022
It's got a bomb.
It's got a bomb.


434
00:52:29.618 --> 00:52:33.262
Tina, two dead robbers.
I mean, what happened?


435
00:52:33.263 --> 00:52:35.481
- It wasn't me.
- Well, where is Lou?


436
00:52:35.482 --> 00:52:36.897
- No idea.
- Well goddamn it,


437
00:52:36.898 --> 00:52:38.040
he's suppose to be on duty.

438
00:52:38.056 --> 00:52:41.789
- Maybe it was a vigilante.
- Well, did you at least get a description.


439
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.378
Ah ha ha.  I did.
Tell him what you told me.


440
00:52:44.779 --> 00:52:47.657
It was a big fucking wolf cop.

441
00:52:50.244 --> 00:52:51.928
Tina here.

442
00:52:55.218 --> 00:52:58.741
There's a fire.  Route 13 just off
junction 8.  Fire trucks are on the way.


443
00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:01.568
You got to be fucking kidding me.

444
00:53:12.102 --> 00:53:15.770
You know, I think we need to lay low.
There's a guy running around with no face.


445
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:19.476
Like you clearly ripped
his whole face right off.


446
00:53:20.504 --> 00:53:22.564
Good evening, gentlemen.

447
00:53:22.565 --> 00:53:24.805
Oohhh.

448
00:53:25.287 --> 00:53:27.703
I'm ready to give my statement now.

449
00:53:27.917 --> 00:53:31.590
- Yeah, I don't think this is a good idea.
- Say bye bye, Willie.


450
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:35.393
- He is much stronger than you.
- He'll be in good hands.


451
00:53:35.494 --> 00:53:40.286
For your safety you should keep him
away from booze and doughnuts.


452
00:53:41.287 --> 00:53:43.573
I'm just...

453
00:53:45.529 --> 00:53:48.386
Hey, you call me if you need any...

454
00:53:49.283 --> 00:53:51.442
I'll just go fuck myself.

455
00:53:52.534 --> 00:53:56.554
Look here.
What big teeth you have.


456
00:53:58.629 --> 00:54:01.958
Whoo, that's not all.

457
00:54:17.706 --> 00:54:19.199
Hey, Jim he...

458
00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.199
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way.


459
00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:26.589
I'm glad I waited this sleep with
this improved version of you.


460
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.445
Everything alright, lover?

461
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.690
I'm sorry, Lou.

462
00:57:21.423 --> 00:57:24.399
But there is a lot about me
you just don't know.


463
00:57:28.292 --> 00:57:33.404
To be truth, but that's I thought
we were getting along so well.


464
00:57:36.056 --> 00:57:40.386
Now dear, good doggie, lie down.

465
00:57:43.883 --> 00:57:46.918
Such a beautiful creature.

466
00:58:00.699 --> 00:58:03.287
Boss, we thought you were dead.

467
00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:08.843
Gather the men.  Meet me at
Enders Road in two hours.


468
00:58:30.386 --> 00:58:33.240
Okay.
Okay.


469
00:58:46.002 --> 00:58:50.831
Now that you successfully bug the
wolf right out of him, that's disgusting.


470
00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:53.693
You're slipping.

471
00:58:54.554 --> 00:58:57.727
You've got one job,
and one job only.


472
00:58:58.228 --> 00:59:01.290
Contain the prey until the eclipse.

473
00:59:01.391 --> 00:59:05.137
- This one's different.
- I don't give a good Goddamn.


474
00:59:05.138 --> 00:59:07.257
He was your responsibility.

475
00:59:07.258 --> 00:59:11.050
I think this one is going to give us
some problem during the hunt, okay.


476
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:13.582
I've been documenting his whole process

477
00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:16.985
and I'm trying to figure out why
he's stronger than all the others.


478
00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:19.737
Let me tell you something.
He's a lot stronger.


479
00:59:20.038 --> 00:59:22.152
- Why?
- Well, you tell me.


480
00:59:22.252 --> 00:59:24.560
Lou Garou is not my choice.

481
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.809
Well, it doesn't make any sense, okay.
Well, it's just... This guy's a loser.


482
00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:31.227
Unless it has something
to do with the liquor.


483
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:34.831
You know what would
happen if anybody saw that.


484
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.350
What are you up to?

485
01:00:34.416 --> 01:00:36.826
What the fuck?

486
01:01:09.391 --> 01:01:10.523
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

487
01:01:10.524 --> 01:01:13.453
<i>You speaking of sunglasses at night,
be sure to wear them today kiddies.</i>


488
01:01:13.454 --> 01:01:16.114
<i>Because, it's one hour
to the solar eclipse.</i>


489
01:01:16.115 --> 01:01:17.682
<i>And if you stare directly at it Dan,</i>

490
01:01:17.683 --> 01:01:20.621
<i>- You will go blind.
- Interesting trivia.</i>


491
01:01:20.622 --> 01:01:23.651
<i>32 years ago, was the last time
the Drink and Shoot was canceled.</i>


492
01:01:23.652 --> 01:01:27.098
<i>Here's summer calling it,
the curse of the eclipse.</i>


493
01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:29.436
<i>So how long is this
solar buzz to last?</i>


494
01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:31.633
<i>The inter-web says
seven and a half minutes.</i>


495
01:01:31.634 --> 01:01:33.922
<i>So if you idiots gonna
put your eyes long enough</i>


496
01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.368
<i>you should be okay.</i>

497
01:01:35.369 --> 01:01:37.316
<i>Wow, seven and a half whole minutes.</i>

498
01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:40.079
<i>- I know that will be tough for you.
- That will be tough for me.</i>


499
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.156
<i>Hey, the eclipse thing and weather
coming after this word from our sponsor.</i>


500
01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:46.362
<i>You guessed it.
Liquor and Doughnuts.</i>


501
01:02:06.466 --> 01:02:10.362
- What's the plan, boss?
- What the fuck are you wearing?


502
01:02:10.363 --> 01:02:12.632
Have you seen what we're up against?

503
01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:17.916
Watch the perimeter.
You shoot anything with a heartbeat.


504
01:02:18.697 --> 01:02:19.776
Come on!

505
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:07.258
You know what they say, Lou.

506
01:03:07.559 --> 01:03:12.187
Keep you friends close,
but your enemies closer.


507
01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:18.113
I'm just fucking with you, man.
I'm a shape shifter.


508
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.739
Help!

509
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.768
Scream all you want, Lou.

510
01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:37.090
For as it is empty, we
canceled the Drink and Shoot.


511
01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:42.909
How long you shape shifters
been running this town?


512
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:45.400
Two hundred years, give or take.

513
01:03:45.401 --> 01:03:48.768
It takes a lot of work
and a lot of sacrifice.


514
01:03:49.569 --> 01:03:53.257
Can't believe I slept with
a 200 year old woman.


515
01:03:53.258 --> 01:03:55.454
Who said I'm a woman?

516
01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.383
Aye, this isn't our first picnic, man.

517
01:04:01.584 --> 01:04:03.780
Your strength comes from the night.

518
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:09.376
All this rather shitty little town.
Not the most ambitious bunch, are you?


519
01:04:09.377 --> 01:04:14.753
Oh, you'll be surprised, how far up a
ladder a little novice blood can go.


520
01:04:42.425 --> 01:04:45.299
No time.
Stay focused.


521
01:05:44.151 --> 01:05:45.723
He's a killer.

522
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.085
It's easier that way.

523
01:06:04.243 --> 01:06:06.634
Sorry, it had to be you man.

524
01:06:13.295 --> 01:06:14.398
Uhh!

525
01:06:26.179 --> 01:06:31.492
- Less than 8 minutes.
- Guess, you're man. And get me that wolf.


526
01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:06.855
Big, fuck wolf!

527
01:07:09.944 --> 01:07:13.046
No...!

528
01:07:15.235 --> 01:07:17.854
Goodnight, sweet friend.

529
01:07:27.413 --> 01:07:29.493
Hands, where I can see them.

530
01:07:30.252 --> 01:07:33.587
- Move, and die.
- Tina!


531
01:07:33.588 --> 01:07:35.510
You don't understand.

532
01:07:35.811 --> 01:07:39.428
We're protecting
Woodhaven from that beast.


533
01:07:39.429 --> 01:07:41.253
Save it, wolf fucker!

534
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:43.795
Hands behind your head.

535
01:07:44.954 --> 01:07:47.578
You're making a big mistake.

536
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.377
You know, the last wolf
I fucked was your father.


537
01:08:37.317 --> 01:08:38.626
Boss?

538
01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:42.153
Why are you dressed like that?

539
01:08:52.257 --> 01:08:53.683
Fuck you!

540
01:08:54.996 --> 01:08:57.492
Not so tough now, are you, huh?

541
01:09:05.363 --> 01:09:06.280
No!

542
01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:13.848
Nice one, huh?

543
01:10:14.947 --> 01:10:16.765
Back at ya.

544
01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:28.723
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah.


545
01:10:34.909 --> 01:10:36.869
This is your fate, Lou.

546
01:10:41.859 --> 01:10:46.056
Like your nosy father.
I need to put you down.


547
01:10:46.057 --> 01:10:50.111
It's funny.
This is the exact spot of new sacrifice.


548
01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.963
Nice continuity to it,
don't you think?


549
01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:56.499
Well, Tina.

550
01:11:21.962 --> 01:11:23.825
I'm impressed, Lou Garou.

551
01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:27.075
But it's time to serve your purpose.

552
01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:36.702
Big mistake.

553
01:11:48.254 --> 01:11:50.491
How does that feel?

554
01:12:06.705 --> 01:12:08.903
Let's end this, Lou.

555
01:12:15.389 --> 01:12:17.341
What do you expect to...?

556
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:28.212
A promotion.

557
01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:14.553
Get up Lou.

558
01:13:26.024 --> 01:13:27.477
Are you okay?

559
01:13:32.051 --> 01:13:34.234
Yah, I could use a drink.

560
01:13:36.038 --> 01:13:41.265
- I could use a hospital.
- Okay, two stops.
