So many potatoes, Franz!

00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.762
Thirty-one!
- Wow!


16
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.305

My vision just went black.

65
00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:21.812

(Father) Greetings.

70
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.929
Dad, are you afraid of death?

71
00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:01.766
No.

72
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.526
Me, yes.

73
00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.526
You don't have to fear death.

74
00:10:12.954 --> 00:10:14.490
Why not?

75
00:10:18.126 --> 00:10:19.788
*Heavy steps*

76
00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:27.879
Dying isn't that bad.

77
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:32.172
You just have to agree with death

78
00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:34.840
that he doesn't take you too early.

79
00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:38.181
How can you reconcile
that with death?


80
00:10:41.983 --> 00:10:45.522
As far as I know, he can
often be found near Rossberg.


81
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:49.108
Real?
- Mmm.


82
00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:54.072
Krausenbauer lived
there a few years ago.


83
00:10:54.245 --> 00:10:55.907
Everyone knew him.

84
00:10:56.873 --> 00:11:01.584
One fall when he came down from

85
00:11:01.753 --> 00:11:05.246
Rossberg, he saw a strange

86
00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:07.164
figure with a dark cloak from afar.

87
00:11:08.927 --> 00:11:10.714
(Whispers) The figure...

88
00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:13.049
has with a scythe...

89
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.883
through the fallen
ones Leaves mown...


90
00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:20.393
...and them into one
Heaps pushed together.


91
00:11:22.607 --> 00:11:24.564
He approached the person.

92
00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:30.606
And then he heard what they.

93
00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:34.070
.. Gestalt was mumbling the whole time. "Every

94
00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:36.618
leaf is a human being,"
"every leaf is a human being."

95
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.532
Suddenly

96
00:11:42.377 --> 00:11:44.460
the figure straightened up

97
00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:47.663
and only now did the
Krausenbauer notice


98
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.924
that it is at the
The figure was not human


99
00:11:51.636 --> 00:11:55.004
but about death.

100
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.263
Death grinned

101
00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:03.813
slowly picked up
a sheet of paper


102
00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:06.682
and said "Yes, Kraus,

103
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.444
this sheet,
that's you!"


104
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.399
For God's sake, the
Krausenbauer thought,


105
00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:17.067
it's cold for him
ran down the back,


106
00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:18.986
but he didn't want to give up.

107
00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:20.370
*takes a deep breath*

108
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.623
That's why he said to death:

109
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.451
"You,...

110
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:29.417
but your scythe has many scratches.

111
00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:32.583
It doesn't cut at all anymore.

112
00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:34.843
Come with me,...

113
00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:37.512
...then I can grind them for you

114
00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:39.799
and you can go back to work."

115
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:43.765
Death looked at his
scythe and thought,


116
00:12:43.938 --> 00:12:47.522
that it is not a mistake to
have a good cutting edge again


117
00:12:47.692 --> 00:12:49.558
and went with the Krausenbauer.

118
00:12:50.153 --> 00:12:52.770
Arrived there,
said the Krausenbauer,


119
00:12:52.947 --> 00:12:56.782
that he needs something
decent to eat before grinding.


120
00:12:58.369 --> 00:12:59.826
“Please be so kind

121
00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:02.621
and go to the pantry

122
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.623
and get a piece of bacon.

123
00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.201
I'll get us a cold beer,

124
00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:11.622
Then we can eat."
said the Krausenbauer to death.


125
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.917
But when death...

126
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.054
...went into the pantry,...

127
00:13:19.557 --> 00:13:24.302
the Krausenbauer behind him has it
Door slammed and locked.


128
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.721
Now death was locked up.

129
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.183
Death begged
whined and screamed.


130
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.443
But nothing helped him.

131
00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:36.814
"I'll release you first,
if you promise me


132
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.858
to get me in 20 years."

133
00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:43.487
Death has cursed...

134
00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:45.656
...and thought...

135
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.042
...but he didn't see a way out.

136
00:13:49.337 --> 00:13:50.873
So he agreed.

137
00:13:52.757 --> 00:13:54.874
But he asked himself the same thing,

138
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:58.215
whatever you're wondering now.

139
00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:01.005
Why only 20 years?

140
00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:05.096
The Krausenbauer could
have asked after 100 years.


141
00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:09.313
When he left the pantry again

142
00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:12.099
and had eaten his bacon sandwich,

143
00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:18.865
he asked the Krausenbauer:
"You, Kraus, why only 20 years?


144
00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.777
You should too

145
00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.452
Or by a thousand."

146
00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.917
Then the Krausenbauer smiled,

147
00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:34.455
took a bite of his bacon sandwich,

148
00:14:34.966 --> 00:14:37.208
took a sip of beer

149
00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.335
and said:

150
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:42.257
"My friend,

151
00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:45.758
look at me,

152
00:14:47.562 --> 00:14:49.474
look at my knees,

153
00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:52.188
look at my hands,

154
00:14:53.651 --> 00:14:55.608
look at my back.

155
00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:59.112
I've worked all my life,

156
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.240
another 20 years

157
00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.412
are more than enough
in this harsh world."


158
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:14.461
And exactly twenty years later,

159
00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:19.837
Krausenbauer never
woke up in the morning.


160
00:15:32.607 --> 00:15:33.848
Sleep now.

161
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.359

162
00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:51.073

*Music ends*

169
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:25.883
Howdy.
- Howdy.


170
00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:36.265
*To carve*

171
00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.652
*door closes*

172
00:17:53.497 --> 00:17:54.738
*clears throat*

173
00:17:56.459 --> 00:17:58.451
(Man) Sign this, Joseph.

174
00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:03.080
(Uneasy) What does it say?

175
00:18:03.924 --> 00:18:07.258
It just says that you are
relinquishing guardianship of him.


176
00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:10.052
*Franz breathes tensely*

177
00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.478
(Man) Can you write your name?

178
00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:23.191
Otherwise you'll make a cross there.

179
00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:30.440
*Makes two lines*

180
00:18:36.207 --> 00:18:37.448

00:18:38.209 --> 00:18:39.450
*startles*

182
00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:05.434
Howdy.

183
00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:08.187
Howdy.

184
00:19:26.048 --> 00:19:27.459
You can eat that.

185
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.796
I am the farmer Seiwald.

186
00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:37.841
I am Franz.

187
00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:41.436
I have a big farm
down in Saalfelden.


188
00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:43.809
Hm?

189
00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.519
I can show you that.

190
00:19:47.445 --> 00:19:49.903
But that's so far away.

191
00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:51.355
*man laughs*

192
00:19:52.241 --> 00:19:54.824
(Man) My servant is waiting
over there with the cart.


193
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.156
Come on.

194
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:02.787
You are with me now.

195
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:06.954
Your father won't get
you through next winter.


196
00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:09.130
I have enough to eat.

197
00:20:09.884 --> 00:20:12.126
And you can even go to school.

198
00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:14.048
Now come.

199
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.553
*Franz groans*

200
00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:19.974
Mummy!  Open up!

201
00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.093
Now I'm getting angry!

202
00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:26.564
*plaintive string music*

203
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.102
Father!

204
00:20:33.407 --> 00:20:34.693
I do not want to go away!

205
00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.617
I promise you, I'll
never get sick again!


206
00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:40.244
Now take it!

207
00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:42.330
(man) Come here!

208
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.786
Let's go!

209
00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:45.825
*Franz screams*

210
00:20:46.587 --> 00:20:48.579
Let me go!

211
00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:50.622
Father!

212
00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.967
Let me go!

213
00:20:59.266 --> 00:21:02.600
Let me go!

214
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.977
*Cries*

215
00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:10.441

<i>He worked meritoriously
for ten years.</i>


225
00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.741
<i>He learned to read and write</i>

226
00:22:07.918 --> 00:22:11.207
<i>and every Sunday Holy
Confession was heard from him.</i>

00:22:12.715 --> 00:22:17.585
<i>On the day he came of age he
asked to be released from his duties.</i>

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.839

on the farm to my satisfaction,</i>

(Man, calling) Can you
please listen for a moment.


236
00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:49.658
It will take a while to move on.

237
00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:51.371
New soups are being made.

238
00:22:51.545 --> 00:22:53.958
Please come back
in half an hour.

Young man, what's wrong with you?
Come here.


245
00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.295
What kind of work do you have?

246
00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:48.808
I was a servant.
- Servant?


247
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:51.599
Well, we offer pay, accommodation,

248
00:23:51.772 --> 00:23:53.638
and three warm meals a day.

249
00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:58.477
Where are you from?
- Saalfelden.


250
00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.646
Saalfelden?  Terrific!

251
00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:02.397
Say...

252
00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:06.363
What's stopping you from doing that?
To serve your fatherland?


253
00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:11.164
I need name,
Date of birth, place of residence.


254
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:13.203
Streitberger, Franz.

255
00:24:16.296 --> 00:24:18.162
April 2, 1919.

256
00:24:20.342 --> 00:24:21.583
Place of residence?

257
00:24:22.302 --> 00:24:23.509
Don't have one right now.

258
00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:25.170
(man shouts) Sit up!

259

*engine whirs*

260
00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:33.728
(Man) Now there's finally
something to work on, right?


261
00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:34.853
Yes.

262
00:24:35.024 --> 00:24:37.482
I mean, feeding the
roosters is your business...


263
00:24:37.693 --> 00:24:40.026
(Second man) I'm not a farmer.

264
00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.269
*clatter*

265
00:24:41.447 --> 00:24:45.157
You said you were from the country.
- Yes, but I'm a locksmith.


266
00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:48.989
Good bye.

267
00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:52.372
I'm Dillinger, Toni. Anthony.

268
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:54.077
Streitberger, Franz.

269
00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:57.243
Where are you from?
- Saalfelden.


270
00:24:58.338 --> 00:25:00.625
(Laughing) Another Pinzgauer!

271
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.257
Decker is also from Pinzgau.
- What about me?


272
00:25:03.427 --> 00:25:05.510
Nothing. Didn't talk to you.

273
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:07.215
I'm from Bischofshofen.

274
00:25:07.723 --> 00:25:10.010
My father has a
cobbler's shop there.


275
00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:11.720
It's not going so
well right now.


276
00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:14.595
Let's see, what
happens in the army.


277
00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:18.311
So what I know is:
Basic training in Lofer,


278
00:25:18.484 --> 00:25:20.271
then we get through
the three years, then we're

279
00:25:20.444 --> 00:25:23.187
up
A permanent position for the rest of your life.


280
00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:25.067
Can you imagine that?

281
00:25:25.449 --> 00:25:26.690
That's incredible.

282
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:31.820
(To other things) I told you that we
would then be in the civil service, right?


283
00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:35.115
(Man) Yes, the three of us stand
Years through and then we can


284
00:25:35.292 --> 00:25:36.783
will no longer be released.

285
00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:39.244
*Birds chirping*

286
00:26:01.235 --> 00:26:03.477
(Dillinger) Howdy, Franz.
- Howdy.


287
00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:05.732
(Franz) Has nothing happened?

288
00:26:05.989 --> 00:26:08.197
No, nothing at all.  
What should happen?

289
00:26:08.742 --> 00:26:11.200
So again.  Observation area:

290
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.363
Left border, edge of the forest.
Right border, highest larch.


291
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.078
Main focus:
Movement line forest aisle.


292
00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:20.244
All suspects must be reported
Movements in the border area.


293
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.457
When posting from
Deputy officer


294
00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:25.374
everyone is in the camp, eating.
Replacement time every three hours.


295
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:27.463
Solution word: border guard.
Understood?


296
00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:28.843
Understood.

297
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.671
So.

298
00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:34.842
Now we sit there and
look over at the Germans.


299
00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:41.056
*Click*

300
00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:47.737
Franz, please tell me something.

301
00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:49.693
What?

302
00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:52.651
Anything.  To kill time.

303
00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:54.239
I'm too bored.

304
00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:03.878
Don't you like to talk?

305
00:27:07.593 --> 00:27:08.834
*laughs quietly*

306
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.757
About something?  
In the household?

307
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:15.507
Does not matter.

308
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:19.682
What is happening in Pinzgau?

309
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.519
Are there any girls
you need to meet?


310
00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:25.149
How does it look for you?

311
00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:35.694
Hm?

312
00:27:35.871 --> 00:27:37.112
I don't know.

313
00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:42.913
*Sighs*

314
00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:44.247
Then just do not.

315
00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:47.414
Tried it.

316
00:27:48.675 --> 00:27:52.589
Can talk to myself.
Get the conversation flowing.


317
00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:55.797

323
00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:23.662
Listen!

324

- I don't know.


326
00:28:28.715 --> 00:28:29.956
Come.

327
00:28:34.972 --> 00:28:36.213
*Click*

Dillinger, how many times do
you want to read your letter?


342
00:30:10.567 --> 00:30:13.184
My father writes that
he is proud of me!


343
00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:16.275
I thought hell would freeze
over before that happened!


344
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.231
*Laughs maliciously* Give it to me!

345
00:30:18.408 --> 00:30:20.616
- (Ironical) Field post control!

346
00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:22.027
(Man) Yes, read out.

347
00:30:22.204 --> 00:30:24.241
Not that the enemy
writes anything to you.


348
00:30:24.414 --> 00:30:28.374
"My dear son, I was
happy to hear from your last


349
00:30:28.543 --> 00:30:31.661
letter that you are now
after the occupation of Poland


350
00:30:31.838 --> 00:30:33.875
you're on your way to the west.

351
00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:37.004
I congratulate you
with all my heart.


352
00:30:37.177 --> 00:30:40.170
I've never been so proud
you to the...


353
00:30:40.722 --> 00:30:43.681
to have raised you to be
what you are now."


354
00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:46.763
(Ironic) I'm proud of you too.

355
00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:50.267
"You know the wounds that the
Franzmann added.


356
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.057
It's up to you now,
to carry out revenge


357
00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:56.569
and to ensure justice."
Yes, we can do that too.


358
00:30:57.114 --> 00:31:00.232
"When you face the
Frenchman, think of me."


359
00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:01.525
Well that's nice.

360
00:31:02.244 --> 00:31:06.238
It sounds like your father would
like to go to the front again himself.


361
00:31:06.415 --> 00:31:07.747
He certainly doesn't want that.

362
00:31:07.916 --> 00:31:10.875
He has been in the for years
Trenches toiled.


363
00:31:11.044 --> 00:31:12.410
Diseases and everything.

364
00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:15.458
He wasn't as lucky as we were.

365
00:31:15.632 --> 00:31:16.793
(man) Hey, look.

366
00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:18.959
(Dillinger) Are we
finally there now?


367
00:31:19.219 --> 00:31:22.383
(Man) Is this supposed to be a castle?
In Vienna that would be a prison.

00:31:22.848 --> 00:31:25.932

as big as I thought.

(High German) So, so!

379
00:32:22.532 --> 00:32:24.569
If these aren't the soldiers of fortune!

380
00:32:25.327 --> 00:32:28.536
Mr Sergeant, we have been
deployed in Poland so far


381
00:32:28.705 --> 00:32:30.742
and have now been
transferred here.


382
00:32:32.334 --> 00:32:35.168
I know that captain
luck has ordered you,


383
00:32:35.337 --> 00:32:36.828
you gorge bastards.

384
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.713
But I thought,
real soldiers are coming!


385
00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:43.543
If you think you're going
to get special treatment


386
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.963
here because you're with our...
Battery boss took


387
00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.178
a few joyrides through Krakow,
did you cut yourself!


388
00:32:55.482 --> 00:32:59.021
Well, we have to do that to you
too Shoot up food with the flak.


389
00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:02.737
Mr Sergeant Major, I
would take the schnitzel...


390
00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:05.398
Now watch out, you
stupid little boner!


391
00:33:05.575 --> 00:33:06.565
Danger!

392
00:33:07.577 --> 00:33:11.036
Captain, the motorcyclists
from Poland have arrived.


393
00:33:11.373 --> 00:33:12.659
Thank you, sergeant major.

394
00:33:12.832 --> 00:33:14.039
Stand comfortably.

395
00:33:15.085 --> 00:33:17.202
Mitteregger.  Dillinger.
- Good day.


396
00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:18.745
saddler.
- Mr.


397
00:33:18.922 --> 00:33:20.538
Streitberger.
- Captain.


398
00:33:20.715 --> 00:33:23.833
Decker.  Good to see her again.
Welcome to the Rhineland.


399
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.797
Was the transfer smooth?

400
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:26.961
(All) Yes!

401
00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:30.802
We're glad, we were bored without
you! But always ready for use.


402
00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:33.218
I promised yes,
I let you request


403
00:33:33.395 --> 00:33:35.261
when I command the battery.

404
00:33:35.438 --> 00:33:37.475
(Dillinger) Are we now?
Soldier of fortune?


405
00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:39.356
Of course we are the soldiers of fortune!

406
00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:41.813
Maybe the decker
is a lucky princess.


407
00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.855
(In the background) Shoot!
- It's not the same as Lodz


408
00:33:45.031 --> 00:33:47.569
or Krakow, but that
Troop is excellent.


409
00:33:47.742 --> 00:33:49.574
Thanks to you, of course, Captain.

410
00:33:49.744 --> 00:33:52.452
Believe me, you didn't
miss anything in Poland.


411
00:33:52.622 --> 00:33:55.490
*Aircraft turbines*
It was colossal boredom.


412

00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:32.823
The men have come a long way,
they have something to look forward to


419
00:34:32.996 --> 00:34:35.158
deserve a drink!
- Yes, Captain!

Do you have another glass for him,
Master Sergeant?


423
00:34:58.438 --> 00:34:59.519
- Yes

424
00:35:01.316 --> 00:35:03.057
What about you, Corporal?

425
00:35:03.943 --> 00:35:06.811
Are you not on
Interested in maintaining companionship?


426
00:35:06.988 --> 00:35:08.104
Compete!

427
00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:13.075
Maier, you stay out of this.
- (High German) Yes.


428
00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:15.531
It's just for mine
Gorge shitter.


429
00:35:16.498 --> 00:35:18.956
Here’s to a happy battery!
- Yes indeed!


430
00:35:19.125 --> 00:35:21.333
Bottom up!
- Bottom up.


431
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:22.952
Bottom up.

432
00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:30.133
Mix with your comrades.

433
00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:32.424
Keep going.
- Yes indeed!


434
00:35:34.015 --> 00:35:36.849
Hey, Streitberger, you like
don't come here?


435
00:35:37.018 --> 00:35:40.352
(Dillinger) We have the Poles
got some shitty vodka.


436
00:35:40.522 --> 00:35:43.640
(Sattler) I didn't think it was
that bad. Where's the cheese?


437
00:35:43.817 --> 00:35:45.558
Back quite there.
- Pass it over.


438
00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:48.561
Tastes really good.

439
00:35:48.738 --> 00:35:50.024
Yes?
- Try it.


440
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.112
*groan of pleasure*

441
00:35:57.831 --> 00:36:01.450
How long have you been there, Maier?
- Eight months now.


442
00:36:01.918 --> 00:36:05.127
And in eight months I'll be
talking as crookedly as you?


443
00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.912
Nothing but sit around and wait.

444
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.674
I'm completely stuffed.
- I couldn't drink anymore.


445
00:36:10.844 --> 00:36:13.086
Real? I already had fun.

446
00:36:13.263 --> 00:36:15.846
So that looks good.
- It's also delicious.


447
00:36:16.015 --> 00:36:18.553
Do we have some wine?
- Yes, there, take it.


448
00:36:18.727 --> 00:36:21.595
Let's hope it doesn't
continue to be so boring.


449
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:25.105
Look, the cheese is so
good, Maier is about to cry!


450
00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:28.271
Shut your mouth and drink.

451
00:36:28.903 --> 00:36:31.111
Streitberger?
- Hey, what's going on?


452
00:36:31.448 --> 00:36:32.438
Streitberger!

453
00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:35.991
What did you do?
- I wanted to pick it up.


454
00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:38.778
What do you mean you pick it up?
Are you crazy?


455
00:36:38.955 --> 00:36:42.414
Give it here.
- Whatever is there is eaten.


456
00:36:43.293 --> 00:36:45.910
And then when we have
nothing, are we happy?


457
00:36:46.087 --> 00:36:47.953
What do you mean if we have nothing?

458
00:36:48.131 --> 00:36:50.293
Do you believe,
will we have nothing?


459
00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:52.003
Please put it back down.

460
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:53.713
Now put the fucking cheese.

461
00:36:53.928 --> 00:36:55.715
You're already full.

462
00:36:55.972 --> 00:36:58.885
(Aloud) Who do you think you are?
Put the cheese down now!


463
00:36:59.267 --> 00:37:00.474
Just leave him alone.

464
00:37:00.643 --> 00:37:01.554
*puts down cheese*

465
00:37:01.728 --> 00:37:04.721
Don't make yourself unhappy.
- That's not right.


466
00:37:05.064 --> 00:37:06.930
Give it to me, Maier.

467
00:37:07.108 --> 00:37:10.272
Streitberger, if there is something
there, then it will be eaten.


468
00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:14.400
We are a family,
we share everything.


469
00:37:14.574 --> 00:37:16.816
We are also part
of something bigger.


470
00:37:16.993 --> 00:37:20.282
Do you know what that is, a family?
Do you even understand that?


471
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:24.369
Is that clear? You can act
like that at home, but not here!


472
00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.124
Hey, now it's good.

473
00:37:26.294 --> 00:37:29.583
Streitberger, I'm talking to you!
- Is that clear, Franz?


474
00:37:30.089 --> 00:37:33.673
Do you understand it, Streitberger?
- Saddler, calm down.


475
00:37:33.843 --> 00:37:35.584
(Sattler) That's not possible!

476

Can you help him?

Are you also writing a letter?

years he writes a letter

- Vitamins or something.

- Yes, yes, you me too.

I'm not in the hospital,
I'm in the brothel.

And now someone has written back.
Her name is Elizabeth.


623
00:47:47.206 --> 00:47:49.539
And the question is:
Which picture do I send her?


624
00:47:55.464 --> 00:47:57.672
If I send her a
picture without asking,


625
00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:01.335
then she feels compelled
also send me one back.

(Dillinger) It doesn't matter,
what they say.

00:49:47.326 --> 00:49:49.943
What is?  Departure in ten minutes.

653
00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.406
Gotta piss.

654
00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.455
*door creaks*

655
00:49:54.917 --> 00:49:56.203

*rumbling*

658
00:50:11.392 --> 00:50:12.803
*roar*

659
00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:19.101
What are you doing with my bike?
- Streitberger!


660
00:50:20.568 --> 00:50:22.685
Imagine me in your sidecar

661
00:50:22.861 --> 00:50:24.443
found a little fox!

662
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.148
(Worried) Where is he?
- Put him out.  There, come here.


663
00:50:28.367 --> 00:50:31.030
Streitberger, come on.
- Streitberger, where to?


664
00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.405
*Rattle*

665
00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.407
*Rooming rumble*

666
00:50:41.046 --> 00:50:42.287
*Breathes heavily*

667
00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:43.622
Streitberger!

668
00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:47.459
(Screams) Corporal,
stopped!


669
00:50:49.805 --> 00:50:51.216
(Soldier) Hop, hop!

670
00:50:56.895 --> 00:50:58.136
*Breathes quickly*

671
00:50:59.315 --> 00:51:01.272
*Distant aircraft turbines*

672
00:51:01.984 --> 00:51:03.441
*Distant whine*

673
00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:14.744

*squeal*

678
00:51:31.597 --> 00:51:33.054
Come on, we're late!

679
00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:38.347
*gasps*

680
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:46.317
(Saddler, shouts)
Streitberger, are you crazy?


681
00:51:46.487 --> 00:51:47.648
(Franz) My stuff!

682
00:51:47.821 --> 00:51:50.985
They shit on me because of
you! What are you thinking?


683
00:51:51.158 --> 00:51:52.148
There!

684
00:51:52.826 --> 00:51:55.443
You have to catch up with Dillinger.
Hurry up!


685
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:58.697
*engine hum*

686
00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:00.535
*Dark roar*

687
00:52:00.918 --> 00:52:03.001
*Distant aircraft turbines*

00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:17.265
*Breathes heavily*

689
00:52:21.689 --> 00:52:24.272
*Menacing roar*

690
00:52:37.996 --> 00:52:39.237
*Whines*

691
00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:42.616
*Strum*

692
00:52:49.717 --> 00:52:50.958
*bang*

693
00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:54.044
*whistle gets louder*

694
00:53:00.018 --> 00:53:01.509
*Shrill whistle*

695
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.402
*Tense string music*

696
00:53:22.958 --> 00:53:24.665
*Music gets more intense*

697
00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:35.252
*clink*

698
00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.170
*Music ends abruptly*

699
00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:43.681
*snorts*

700
00:53:47.274 --> 00:53:50.358
*Mysterious percussion music*

701
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:13.290
*soft whine*

702
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.471
*whine*

703
00:54:31.193 --> 00:54:32.434
(Shouting) Move!

704
00:54:33.237 --> 00:54:34.444
Further!

705
00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:37.738
(In the background) Forward!

706
00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:41.530
What's up with them?

707
00:54:41.703 --> 00:54:43.114
English, French...

708
00:54:43.288 --> 00:54:44.824
It's been like this all day.

709
00:54:44.998 --> 00:54:48.082
You can't lock them away
as quickly as they give up.


710
00:54:48.252 --> 00:54:50.585
(Incredulous) What?  We win?

711
00:54:53.841 --> 00:54:55.377
What is your mission?

712
00:54:55.551 --> 00:54:57.918
I have to find a
connection with a comrade.


713
00:54:58.095 --> 00:55:00.212
He's already driven ahead.
- His name?


714
00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:03.382
Corporal Dillinger,
first battery, first department,


715
00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:04.515
Flak Regiment 38.

716
00:55:04.685 --> 00:55:06.426
Dillinger?  He was already there.

717
00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.060
Already an hour ago.
- Real?


718
00:55:08.647 --> 00:55:10.058
*clatter*

719
00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:15.150
*plane roar*

720
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.481
*crows scream*

721
00:55:21.243 --> 00:55:23.075
*Tense string music*

722
00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:25.035
*Fire crackles*

723
00:55:41.096 --> 00:55:43.133
*Long high string sounds*

724
00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.052
*gasps*

725
00:55:50.022 --> 00:55:51.229
*Music ends abruptly*

726
00:55:51.398 --> 00:55:52.809
*spits*

727
00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:54.519
*Breathes heavily*

728
00:55:58.906 --> 00:56:00.317
*leaves rustle*

*squeal*

730
00:56:26.058 --> 00:56:27.299
*Sighs*

731
00:56:32.773 --> 00:56:34.514
*purrs*

732
00:56:39.112 --> 00:56:40.353
Shh.

733
00:56:42.616 --> 00:56:44.278
Is it better now?

734
00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:52.414
*Quiet string music*

735
00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:06.880
Now I'll catch you!

736
00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:08.551
I'll catch you!

737
00:57:10.018 --> 00:57:11.259
*Growl*

738
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.597
*Laugh*

739
00:57:12.771 --> 00:57:13.978
Wow, you're quick!

740
00:57:16.858 --> 00:57:18.394
Come on, catch me!  Come!

741
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:20.602
*cackle*

742
00:57:23.782 --> 00:57:25.068
*purrs*

743
00:57:25.242 --> 00:57:26.483
*Breathes exhausted*

744
00:57:32.165 --> 00:57:33.451
*Laugh*

745
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.377
I'll make sure nothing happens to you.

746
00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:40.250
I promise you that.

747
00:57:42.009 --> 00:57:43.250
*cheep*

748
00:57:57.899 --> 00:57:59.515
*grass rustles*

749
00:58:08.118 --> 00:58:09.859
*Music ends*

750
00:58:16.376 --> 00:58:17.912
*gusts of wind*

751
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:31.506
*Distant sound of the sea*

752
00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:39.271
*Loud wind rushing*

753
00:59:28.532 --> 00:59:30.319
*sound of the sea*

754
00:59:37.374 --> 00:59:39.081
(Franz) Greetings.

755
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:55.885
(Franz) There you are.

756
00:59:57.853 --> 00:59:59.765
Yes, there I am.

757
00:59:59.938 --> 01:00:01.179
Shh.

758
01:00:01.523 --> 01:00:02.889
*Purr*

759
01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:10.358
Have you already handed in the letter?

760
01:00:11.199 --> 01:00:12.440
Yes.

761
01:00:12.617 --> 01:00:15.860
I already have a new one.
We have to go back to Cambrai.


762
01:00:19.332 --> 01:00:20.698
Back to Cambrai.

763
01:00:25.797 --> 01:00:27.379
Where does the animal come from?

764
01:00:28.967 --> 01:00:30.549
He came to me.

765
01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:34.925
What do you mean he came to you?

766
01:00:40.187 --> 01:00:42.019
His mother died.

767
01:00:44.983 --> 01:00:46.269
And now?

768
01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.190
Is he staying with you?

769
01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:54.732
I think so.

770
01:00:59.831 --> 01:01:01.823
Franz, please tell me where you were.

771
01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.204
I was looking for you, Toni.

772
01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:11.833
What are you talking about?

773
01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:16.050
(accusatory)
Suddenly you were gone.


774
01:01:17.933 --> 01:01:20.846
Jokesch said,
you ran out of the barracks.


775
01:01:21.853 --> 01:01:23.765
I thought you deserted.

776
01:01:25.273 --> 01:01:26.980
I would never desert.

777
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.442
I went into the forest.

778
01:01:34.449 --> 01:01:37.112
Why are you going into the forest
when we attack?


779
01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:41.453
Were you scared?

780
01:01:47.545 --> 01:01:48.877
I was not afraid.

781
01:01:55.637 --> 01:01:57.094
Me, yes.

782
01:02:03.895 --> 01:02:05.978
If you negotiate well with death,

783
01:02:06.147 --> 01:02:08.184
he'll get you first
if that's okay with you.


784
01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.394
*cheep*

785
01:02:16.992 --> 01:02:19.359
Living forever would also be terrible.

786
01:02:24.457 --> 01:02:26.414
Living forever would be terrible.

787
01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.166
*Emotional string music*

788
01:02:44.936 --> 01:02:46.177
Taste it.

789
01:03:46.998 --> 01:03:48.534
*music stops*

790
01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:09.097
*background conversations*

791
01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.143
*squeal*

792
01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.649
Franz?

793
01:04:26.538 --> 01:04:29.030
Howdy.

794
01:04:33.461 --> 01:04:35.043
Got through okay?

795
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.121
Yes.

796
01:04:37.966 --> 01:04:39.298
Himself?

797
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.001
Yes.

798
01:04:44.764 --> 01:04:46.346
Everything happened quickly.

799
01:04:48.268 --> 01:04:49.509
Yes indeed.

800
01:04:50.395 --> 01:04:51.977
I wouldn't have thought.

801
01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.188
Have you also seen the sea?

802
01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.145
(Shouting) Men!  
It's starting!

803
01:04:57.318 --> 01:04:58.479
Yes.

804
01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:01.649
*Steps*

805
01:05:09.914 --> 01:05:11.450
*Loud babble of voices*

806
01:05:39.986 --> 01:05:41.818
*Incomprehensible announcement*

807
01:05:47.952 --> 01:05:49.739
(announcement in standard German)

808
01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:53.281
<i>The Wehrmacht's high command
came from the Führer's headquarters</i>


809
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.290
<i>The following special announcement is known:</i>

810
01:05:57.086 --> 01:06:00.500
<i>The complete collapse
of the entire French front</i>


811
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.754
<i>between the English Channel and the
Maginot Line near Montmédy</i>


812
01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:08.262
<i>has the original intention
of the French leadership,</i>


813
01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:12.050
<i>to defend the capital of France.</i>

814
01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:16.266
<i>As a result, Paris was
declared an open city.</i>


815
01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:17.725
*spiteful laugh*

816
01:06:17.899 --> 01:06:21.267
<i>The invasion of the victorious
German troops has just taken place</i>


817
01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.400
<i>took place in Paris.</i>

818
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:23.651
*Loud cheers*

819
01:06:28.034 --> 01:06:29.570
You hear it for yourself!

820
01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:33.071
What you have mastered in the

821
01:06:33.248 --> 01:06:34.739
last few weeks is superhuman.

822
01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:37.374
In recognition of this

The time for
fighting is now over.

My staff and I are about to
explore the local conditions.

Understand.


977
01:18:28.796 --> 01:18:32.210
I guess there's no room
for more soldiers here.


978
01:18:32.549 --> 01:18:34.632
The house is occupied, Mr Sergeant.

(Claps) Oui!

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.701
Now he's done it.

1001
01:20:32.336 --> 01:20:33.622
He likes the little ones.

Non.

1015
01:21:14.253 --> 01:21:15.960

Streitberger.

1071
01:26:48.795 --> 01:26:51.287
The house is occupied
I've already said that.


1072
01:26:51.465 --> 01:26:54.924
You must report to your
battery manager immediately.


1073
01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:58.921
No, orders are not issued until tomorrow.
- No now.


1074
01:26:59.306 --> 01:27:01.013
The command was instantaneous.

1075
01:27:02.309 --> 01:27:04.266
(man) What did you do?

1076
01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.728
You.  Renard.

1077
01:27:17.282 --> 01:27:18.523
Oui.

1078
01:27:20.285 --> 01:27:22.117
I'll be right back.

01:27:22.996 --> 01:27:25.113

1081
01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:42.592
Mr. Captain,

1082
01:27:42.766 --> 01:27:45.600
Lance Corporal Streitberger
reports as ordered.


1083
01:27:45.769 --> 01:27:47.510
Do you know why you are here?

1084
01:27:47.979 --> 01:27:49.470
No, captain.

1085
01:27:49.648 --> 01:27:50.889
Sergeant Major.

1086
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:54.395
Streitberger.

1087
01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.403
You have received strict orders
to be with Corporal Dillinger on


1088
01:27:57.572 --> 01:28:00.736
the tenth of May Troop frames
act as motorcycle detectors,


1089
01:28:00.909 --> 01:28:04.698
sending important messages to
those ahead to deliver attack units.


1090
01:28:04.955 --> 01:28:07.789
Is it correct that way?
- Yes, sir.


1091
01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:10.825
*Footsteps*
Nevertheless, immediately


1092
01:28:11.711 --> 01:28:14.829
before the attack
began, you left the


1093
01:28:15.006 --> 01:28:17.965
motorcycle staging area of ​​the

1094
01:28:18.134 --> 01:28:20.592
western camp and went
into the adjacent forest.


1095
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:24.339
When I spoke to you
on May 10th at 5:20


1096
01:28:24.516 --> 01:28:27.008
a.m. and asked
you about your As I


1097
01:28:27.185 --> 01:28:29.347
pointed out my order,
you also ignored my order.


1098
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:33.143
They deliberately distanced
themselves from the force.


1099
01:28:33.567 --> 01:28:34.808
Is that right?

1100
01:28:36.152 --> 01:28:39.065
I didn't want to move away, Mr.

1101
01:28:39.239 --> 01:28:41.151
Sergeant Major. Have you
moved away, Yes or no?


1102
01:28:43.243 --> 01:28:44.484
Yes indeed.

1103
01:28:45.036 --> 01:28:46.652
Lance Corporal Dillinger, when

1104
01:28:47.372 --> 01:28:50.115
did Streitberger join you again?

1105
01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.830
After a few days. On the coast.

1106
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.333
But I don't know
exactly when Mr.


1107
01:28:57.048 --> 01:28:58.289
Sergeant Major.

1108
01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:05.297
After a few days. (Major Sergeant)
Streitberger, why did you leave the camp?


1109
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:11.723
Mr.

1110
01:29:12.731 --> 01:29:16.065
Captain, I would never desert. (master
sergeant) How then do you explain your behavior?


1111
01:29:20.572 --> 01:29:22.154
(Energetic) Speak up!

1112
01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:24.907
Otherwise, no answer
is also an answer.


1113
01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:28.991
Captain, I took one of
the miracle pills, Lance


1114
01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:32.953
Corporal Dillinger and I took
one Corporal Maier got it.

1115
01:29:33.126 --> 01:29:34.992
My vision went black...

1116
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:37.378
Do you speak German?
you don't understand anything!


1117
01:29:37.547 --> 01:29:40.290
(High German)
My eyes went black.


1118
01:29:40.634 --> 01:29:42.967
And then I'm in Camp ran back,

1119
01:29:43.136 --> 01:29:44.968
but the troops were already gone.

1120
01:29:47.807 --> 01:29:51.300
Does that agree

1121
01:29:51.478 --> 01:29:52.434
with the explanation?

1122
01:29:54.898 --> 01:29:56.855
Yes, sir, sergeant major.

1123
01:29:58.068 --> 01:30:01.436
(Sergeant Major) Do you have
anything else to add, Dillinger?


1124
01:30:01.613 --> 01:30:02.774
(Dillinger) No.

1125
01:30:05.492 --> 01:30:07.779
(man, standard German)
I've been before too


1126
01:30:07.953 --> 01:30:10.115
because of a little
thing in there. Drinking.


1127
01:30:10.288 --> 01:30:12.826
Time passes very quickly,
you will see.


1128
01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:15.411

Read a few books and the
ten days will go by quickly.


1133
01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.127
Come.

1134
01:30:28.974 --> 01:30:30.215
Heads up.

1135

Small!

1136

1138
01:30:38.817 --> 01:30:41.184

(Strictly) Streitberger!

1150
01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:05.123
They were always a role
model for courage and will.


1151
01:33:05.296 --> 01:33:07.583
Volunteered for special trips

1152
01:33:07.757 --> 01:33:11.091
and mission-relevant tasks.
And now you're sleeping in the forest?


1153
01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:13.093
And you look like
a water corpse?!


1154
01:33:13.763 --> 01:33:15.880
Why do you keep calling for me?

1155
01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:18.970
Answer!
- Captain, I thought...


1156
01:33:19.144 --> 01:33:20.601
Oh, papperlapapp!

1157
01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:24.062
Captain!
- What?


1158
01:33:24.274 --> 01:33:26.391
There's a woman in
a house, in the village.


1159
01:33:27.652 --> 01:33:29.894
Can you send someone there?

1160
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.363
You and your French wives.

1161
01:33:32.532 --> 01:33:35.115
They really turned your heads.

1162
01:33:35.535 --> 01:33:37.197
Who is this lady?

1163
01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:38.990
Her name is Marie.

1164
01:33:39.164 --> 01:33:42.077
She doesn't know I'm there,
and that would be very

1165
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:44.742
important that she knows
that I will be back in five days.


1166
01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.535
Why is that important?

1167
01:33:50.383 --> 01:33:51.874
My fox is with her.

1168
01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.336
I'm sorry, what?

1169
01:33:56.723 --> 01:33:58.259
My fox is with her.

1170
01:34:00.351 --> 01:34:01.762
Your fox?

1171
01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:04.474
You mean an animal?
- A puppy.


1172
01:34:04.647 --> 01:34:08.140
(Whimpering) Captain, he's
still very small, he doesn't know


1173
01:34:08.318 --> 01:34:10.731
that I am there.
And I promised him...


1174
01:34:10.904 --> 01:34:13.112
that I'm on him...
- Stop it now!


1175
01:34:13.573 --> 01:34:15.735
One has the impression,
They speak deliriously.


1176
01:34:16.159 --> 01:34:18.492

1177

01:35:39.242 --> 01:35:40.653
I was locked up.
