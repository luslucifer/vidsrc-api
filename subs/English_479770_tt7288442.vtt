'bout this right here?

[tree leaves rustle]

8
00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.182
Put that there.

[tree leaves rustle]

10
00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:01.533
- [Kelly] Where're we gonna
put granny's ornament?


11
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.984
- Ooh, how 'bout right
there next to the garland?


12
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.685
Do you think Santa's
gonna like it?


13
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:16.858
- Of course I do.

14
00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:18.515
I think he's gonna love it.

15
00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:22.761
- Yeah, yeah, I think
he's gonna love it.


16
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.697
It's got a uh, sort of
a, a post-modern look.


17
00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:29.871
Yes, I think he's really
going to enjoy it.


18
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:33.841
- Hey, you can't have those.
[Kelly gasps]


19
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.946
Those are for santa.

20
00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:37.258
- What?

21
00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:38.535
Come on.

22
00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.331
- You know that Santa
gets first pick,


23
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.885
every single year.

24
00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:44.714
- I do.

25
00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:45.749
I do know this,

26
00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.855
and that is why I also know

27
00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.755
that these ones here
are his favorite,


28
00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:54.724
so this doesn't really matter.

29
00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:57.209
- I heard that Santa's
having a really hard time


30
00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.453
fitting into his suit this year.

31
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.385
- 'Cause he's fat?

32
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:01.627
- Yeah,
[Simon laughs]


33
00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:04.389
we've gotta watch
over those cookies.


34
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:05.217
- Yeah.

35
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.289
- Hey.

36
00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.054
- You know what else?

37
00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.884
I think that it
snowed last night.


38
00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:20.336
- Can I go out and
play in the snow?


39
00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:23.132
- Hmm, well, let me see.

40
00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:24.478
Let me think about that.

41
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.651
Of course.

42
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.894
- Yes.

43
00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.172
- But, I think you
should ask daddy


44
00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:30.898
to go out and play with you,

45
00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:34.246
after he's done
chewing this cookie.


46
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.940
- I would like to play
in the snow with you,


47
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.429
but I'm supposed
to build a snowman.


48
00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.016
- [Kelly] That's right.

49
00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.950
- Right, and I don't have
anyone to build it with,


50
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.228
and I need someone
else to build it with.


51
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:52.092
Do you know anyone that
can build a snowman?


52
00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:54.059
- I can.

53
00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.372
- You could build
a snowman with me?


54
00:02:58.719 --> 00:02:59.685
Well, then let's go.

55
00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:02.136
Let's do it, put
your clothes on.


56
00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:03.413
[Kelly chuckles]

57
00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.415
- Okay, well you two
have fun, all right?


58
00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:08.384
But bundle up, or you'll
both turn into snowmen.


59

60
00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:16.771
Riley.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.707

[bleak music]

68
00:05:45.265 --> 00:05:46.921
- Mommy, I'm hungry.

69
00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:52.789
- Okay, hun.

70
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.415
I'll make us some
dinner, all right?


71
00:05:57.415 --> 00:05:58.278
All right.

72
00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:53.781
[gas hisses]

73
00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:35.892
- Simon, please.

74
00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:45.523
Are you crazy?

75
00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:51.701
You can't go out there again.

76
00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:53.047
- [Simon] I don't have a choice.

77
00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:57.845
- You're gonna get
yourself killed.


78
00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.268
- I'll be fine.

79

[gun clicks]

That's set to channel two, okay?

81
00:08:39.024 --> 00:08:40.336
Don't open that door for anyone

82
00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.027
until you hear
from me, all right?


83
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:44.547
- Okay.

84
00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:49.518
Wait.

85
00:08:50.933 --> 00:08:52.175
What about Riley?

86
00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:54.523
He needs you.

87
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.422
[sobs] And I need you.

88
00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:02.634
- What we need is supplies.

89
00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.258
We can't sit around down here,

90
00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:09.089
waiting for some magic
solution to show up,


91
00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:10.124
'cause it's not comin',

92
00:09:10.124 --> 00:09:11.401
and if I don't go out there

93
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:13.473
and get us food and water,

94
00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:17.546
we're dead anyway.

95
00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:20.652
- [sobs] It's just,

96
00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:22.067
I can't, I can't,

97
00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:26.347
I can't do this.

98

[sobs]

99
00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.595
- [Riley] Why are
you crying, mommy?


100
00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:33.527
- Honey, it's okay.

101
00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:34.494
Here, come.

102
00:09:34.494 --> 00:09:35.702
Come here, give me a hug.

103
00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:39.499
Oh boy.

104
00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:43.537
Look, daddy just,

105
00:09:43.537 --> 00:09:46.229
he's gotta go away
for a little while.


106
00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:47.058
Okay?

107
00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:56.723
- Listen.

108
00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:01.555
I do, I have to go
out for a little bit,


109
00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:03.902
but I'll be back
real soon, all right?


110
00:10:03.902 --> 00:10:05.352
- Where do you have to go?

111
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:08.493
- Well, I gotta go
out and get more food,


112
00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:13.222
and maybe some clothes.

113
00:10:13.222 --> 00:10:14.637
What do you think?

114
00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:15.465
- And toys?

115
00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:18.261
[Simon laughs]

116
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:19.539
- Of course.

117
00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:21.023
And toys, of course.

118
00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.025
But,

119
00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:28.306
listen, I need you to do
me a favor, all right?


120
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:33.691
While I'm gone, I need you
to be the man of the house.


121
00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:39.697
You know, take care of
your mom while I'm away.


122
00:10:39.697 --> 00:10:40.732
Think you can do that?

123
00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:41.561
- Yes.

124
00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:42.423
- Yeah?

125
00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:43.217
Promise?

126
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.668
I know you can.

127
00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.223
Come here.

128
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:54.953
I love you, buddy.

129
00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:58.405
I really do.

130
00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:04.204
All right.

131
00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:05.308
I'll be back.

132
00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:17.735
I'm comin' back, I promise.

133
00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:21.462
- [Kelly] You better.
[sobs]


134
00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:23.603
I love you.

135
00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:26.813
- I love you too.

136
00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:34.579
[Kelly sobs]

137
00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:35.476
- Be careful.

138
00:11:38.376 --> 00:11:39.860
Please be careful.

Hey, hun.

146
00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:14.783
What you drawing there?

147
00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:19.477
- This is our house,
you, and me, and daddy.


148
00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:22.411
- Oh yeah, but wait a minute.

149
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:24.585
What's wrong with
our heads there?


150
00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:25.966
- Those are our funny masks.

151
00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:32.732
- Oh, I see.

152
00:13:34.492 --> 00:13:36.425
Well, it's coming along nicely.

153
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.325
- When can I go outside to play?

154
00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:44.502
- I'm really sorry, honey,

155
00:13:44.502 --> 00:13:47.677
but we can't go
outside right now.


156
00:13:47.677 --> 00:13:51.267
We have to wait until things
get better out there, okay?


157
00:13:51.267 --> 00:13:53.166
- How long will that take?

158
00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:59.413
- Well, I don't really know,

159
00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.762
but how 'bout this?

160
00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:06.524
In the meantime, you can
draw me another picture,


161
00:14:06.524 --> 00:14:08.837
of a robot.

162
00:14:08.837 --> 00:14:09.769

[Kelly laughs]

you're favorite.


165
00:15:03.477 --> 00:15:05.548

Pow.

Okay, well, normally we would
need a chimney to do this,

00:49:08.866 --> 00:49:12.559
but I think this is
gonna work out just fine.

Okay, can you hold that?

343
00:49:17.633 --> 00:49:21.464
And get a match.

344
00:49:21.464 --> 00:49:22.293
All right.

to open one present?

some room for a crusader.

we could make room

know where to start.

you work with me here?

Just, can you sit
up straight please?

all to yourself now.

Ah, all right, well,

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:14.443
I think we should get
the deluxe package.

But is that gonna
be enough wallets?

I mean, unless you plan
on handing them out

01:02:21.968 --> 01:02:25.903
at a baseball game, I
think a hundred's okay.
