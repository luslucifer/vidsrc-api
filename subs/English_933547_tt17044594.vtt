00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:42.711
To the max! That's it!

2
00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.628
- Come on!
- Go, go, go, go! Bodzio! Get him! Come on!


3
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.253
Bodzio, go, go, go!

4
00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.545
Hold on.
Michał, isn't that your car, dude?


5
00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:51.378
Now, now, now. 
Shift the gears.

6
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.878
No. Hey, wait. Almost there. Almost there.

7
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.086
Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

8
00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:08.295
Go faster! Now! Ahh!

9
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:09.961
We got him!

10
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.003
Go!

11
00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:40.378
Can you not?

12
00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:53.295
Just leave it on, Dad.

13
00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.521
<i>...beach town of Hel won't disappoint.</i>

<i>Today, we're gonna see ideal weather
for beginners and veteran surfers alike.</i>


15
00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:03.003
<i>Perfect weather.</i>

16
00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.461
<i>Sunny with signs showing

17
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.336
Antoś.

18
00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:11.503
Look who's waking up.

19
00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:13.586
Don't cry, sweetie. Please.

20
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.670
We're gonna be there so soon.

21
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.086
Hey, Antoś.

22
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.295
Shh.

23
00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:22.128
Hello.

24
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.878
Ah! Whoo!

25
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:31.961
Come on!

26
00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.336
It's moving now.
That's it. Come on, come on.


27
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Come on, Bodzio!

28
00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:37.836
Sasza!

29
00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:39.878
Whole crew's on-board?

30
00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:42.461
That's how you do it.

31
00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:52.793
Thank you!

32
00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:53.670
You got it.

33
00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:55.170
Why, hello there!

34
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:18.251
How are we doing?

35
00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:21.295
Should I take off?

36
00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:23.086
- Michał!
- Do it!


37
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.670
Let's go flying.

38
00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:35.503
Whoo!

MISTRAL
HOTEL & SPA


57
00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:20.961
Hello, ladies.

58
00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:24.336
- Hello there, Mr. Miron.
- Oh, I'm happy to see you.


59
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.920
A warm welcome back.

60
00:05:26.003 --> 00:05:27.628
Finally.

61
00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:29.336
The keys are there in the car.

62
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.253
This place has really changed a lot.

63
00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:33.253
Come to Mommy. Come on.

64
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.753
Hello, hello, hello,
little buddy!


65
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.795
What happened? 
Don't worry about it!

66
00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:42.711
Fortunately, as a matter of fact,
I like to eat tears!


67
00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:43.628
Look.

68
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:46.670
And so now, I'll eat them up!

69
00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:49.670
Ooh, that's pretty tasty.

70
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.878
I can see another tear here.

71
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.586
- Ooh, that's so tasty.
- Wow.


72
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.170
Peekaboo!

73
00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:00.045
Professor, you're here!

74
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:01.586
Oh, my goodness.

75
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.295
I can't believe my own eyes.

76
00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:04.378
Hello.

77
00:06:07.003 --> 00:06:08.961
- And?
- Looking younger every year.


78
00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:10.836
But this time, 
I can't take credit.

79
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.670
I live with my husband in Brussels.

80
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.920
But I missed you.

81
00:06:15.503 --> 00:06:17.336
I'll see you during supper. Bye.

82
00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:22.878
I'm sorry you had to wait,
but the apartment's ready.


83
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:25.045
The same as always, dear professor.

84
00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:26.295
Thank you, Mr. Miron.

85
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.253
Let's go. Ania.

86
00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:32.628
We won't all fit in.
I'll take the next one.


87
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:34.461
Ania!

88
00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:37.461
Mmm.

89
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:41.336
I don't know
if it's appropriate for an old man like me


90
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.253
to hug such a beautiful young woman,

91
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.628
but so what?
You only live once. Am I right?


92
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.586
I'd have been offended if you hadn't.

93
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.670
Excuse me. Sorry. Mr. Miron?

94
00:06:51.253 --> 00:06:54.170
This mascot is in terrible taste.
We need to get rid of it.


95
00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:57.086
But the boy's
been working here every summer.


96
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.170
But this year, the rules are changing.

97
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.753
What? Haven't you noticed yet?

98
00:07:02.128 --> 00:07:05.586
Sorry for butting in like this,
but, um, that bear was a big help.


99
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.150
He managed to distract my baby brother,
which isn't easy to do.


100
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.920
We really do owe a lot to him.

101
00:07:13.128 --> 00:07:16.711
Just make sure he washes
and properly disinfects that costume.


102
00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:20.128
Right.

103
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.295
There you go. There you go.

104
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.128
Thank you. That's all.

105
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:38.128
- Have a good day.
- You too.


106
00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:30.795
May I?

107
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.670
Yeah.

108
00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:42.753
I'm Crumb.

109
00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:46.003
Ania.

110
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.336
"Crumb" is just my stage name.
To friends, I'm Janek.


111
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:51.211
Hi, Janek.

112
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:53.961
Thanks for helping me out at the hotel.

113
00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:55.836
No problem.

114
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.920
Hmm?

115
00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:00.211
Mmm.

116
00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:01.503
Okay.

117
00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:06.086
Smoking is definitely very bad
for your health. Although...


118
00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:11.045
Help me?

119
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.628
As they all say...

120
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:17.878
everything that's cool

121
00:10:18.753 --> 00:10:20.045
is either unhealthy,

122
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920
or is fattening,

123
00:10:22.753 --> 00:10:24.628
or it's immoral.

124
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.378
I'm a fan of cool things.

125
00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:31.896
Except sometimes it makes my fur stink,

126
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:33.128
and that's not so cool.

127
00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:41.586
All right, I gotta go,
or that harpy's gonna kill me.


128
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.003
Are you coming or staying?

129
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.586
I'm staying.

130
00:10:46.086 --> 00:10:47.878
Been looking forward to this view.

131
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:49.961
All right.

132
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.628
Bye. I'm off to see the little ones.

133
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.128
Oh, the eurodeputy's wife is here.

134
00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:31.170
Alone again?

135
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.086
She knows what she's doing,
diversifying her portfolio.


136
00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.003
Gąssowski is looking pretty good too.

137
00:11:38.253 --> 00:11:39.711
Yeah, he looks good, huh?

138
00:11:40.836 --> 00:11:43.420
I can only hope
I'll look that good at his age.


139
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.336
But you are his age.

140
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.628
Mmm.

141
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.586
Here come the stars of the evening.

142
00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.170
- Hel welcomes back Warsaw.
- Hi, hi, hi. Hello.


143
00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.920
I could not suffer through
another summer without you.


144
00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:05.336
Really. Absolutely no way.

145
00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:07.378
Hi, Andrzej.

146
00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:09.295
- Hi, Marek.
- Hi, Auntie.


147
00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:13.336
Oh, you're grown.
I'm so happy to see you again, honey.


148
00:12:13.836 --> 00:12:16.336
I'm really happy
that you came here, you know.


149
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.753
Sit down. Sit down here.

150
00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:19.271
- Right next to Kuba.
- There.


151
00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:21.170
- You're looking beautiful.
- Thank you.


152
00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:24.003
Well, well, well...

153
00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:26.420
I assume you've gossiped about everyone?

154
00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:29.836
Of course.
t's our favorite pastime.


155
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.003
Of course. Do you remember
what we used to get up to here?


156
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:33.961
That's not true.

157
00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.878
This guy was the biggest drunk.

158
00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:37.170
Of course.

159
00:12:37.253 --> 00:12:38.503
Good evening, everyone.

160
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:40.461
- Is everything to your liking?
- Yes.


161
00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.378
Um, my name is Miranda.

162
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.045
If you need anything,
the waiters will come to you.


163
00:12:45.128 --> 00:12:46.753
You just need to let me know.

164
00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:49.253
Why don't we start
with an Aperol each?


165
00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:50.545
No, thank you.

166
00:12:50.628 --> 00:12:52.711
- Two more Aperols.
- Of course.


167
00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:58.461
Oh, stop it. Don't.

168
00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:00.086
Marek, watch it.

169
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.295
- Stop. Now.
- All right, all right.


170
00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:14.795
So, listen, we have news. Good news.

171
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.836
We also have news,
but you can go first.


172
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.253
Okay, we'll go first.

173
00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:21.003
We're going back to Poland permanently.

174
00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:22.545
Ah.

175
00:13:23.128 --> 00:13:24.604
- Uh, thank you.
- Thank you.


176
00:13:24.628 --> 00:13:26.920
And the pandemic has
chased you out of London?


177
00:13:27.003 --> 00:13:28.170
No way.

178
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.045
And didn't it ruin you?

179
00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:34.795
No. On the contrary, I had to employ
some additional staff doctors.


180
00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:37.378
We're struggling to keep up,
but I'm not complaining.


181
00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:38.795
Dad is also expanding.

182
00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:42.295
We're opening a new law firm.
This time in Warsaw.


183
00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.836
And London will be running the office.

184
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.420
Remotely!

185
00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:52.336
- All right, it's time for our news.
- Hope it's good.


186
00:13:54.878 --> 00:13:57.378
Looks like our kids
will miss each other,


187
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:59.753
because Ania just got into med school.

188
00:14:00.253 --> 00:14:03.336
King's College. Early admission.
I couldn't be more proud.


189
00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:07.128
- Well!
- Oh!


190
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:09.003
Such wonderful news.

191
00:14:11.336 --> 00:14:12.753
That's surprising.

192
00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.836
A success!

193
00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:18.128
Well, bravo! Bra... No, bravo.

194
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:19.586
Uh, Mareczek, hey.

195
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.211
Of course. We will toast with champagne

196
00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:24.586
to Ania's success.

197
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.753
- Waiter!
- I'm very sorry.


198
00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:29.211
Could we please order
a bottle of champagne?


199
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:31.045
Thank you very much.

200
00:14:32.378 --> 00:14:33.420
Congrats.

201
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.545
You'll eventually take over
your dad's clinic, right?


202
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.420
Dunno.

203
00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:44.378
I'm still mulling it all over.

204
00:14:45.086 --> 00:14:46.711
Just haven't decided yet.

205
00:14:48.545 --> 00:14:50.420
Of course, you still have some time.

206
00:14:50.961 --> 00:14:53.336
Maybe you could do
your residency in pediatrics,


207
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.420
and we'll go from there.

208
00:14:54.503 --> 00:14:55.753
Champagne, sir.

209
00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.336
Oh!

210
00:14:59.045 --> 00:15:01.878
I'm sure
Ania will have other ambitions...


211
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:04.086
Excuse me,
are you just going to stand there?


212
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.378
Ah, there you go.

213
00:15:05.461 --> 00:15:06.961
She'll be an excellent doctor.

214
00:15:08.253 --> 00:15:09.170
Female doctor.

215
00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:10.836
Male, female, is there a difference?

216
00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:12.920
Gynecologist, Dad.

217
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.128
- I'm so sorry!
- No, I'm sorry.


218
00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.253
Why don't I...

219
00:15:22.336 --> 00:15:24.216
- It's my fault.
- Hands off my daughter.


220
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:27.086
Back in the day,
this would have been unthinkable.


221
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.503
Ania, everything all right?

222
00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:29.866
- So sorry.
- Incompetent!


223
00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:31.503
Mr. Michał.

224
00:15:33.586 --> 00:15:35.753
I assure you,
this will never happen again.


225
00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:37.086
I am truly sorry.

226
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:39.961
Of course, the champagne is on the house.

227
00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:43.378
- Mm-hmm. It better be.
- At least that's something.


228
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:44.670
Hey, wait up.

229
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:49.711
I apologize.

230
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:54.753
Thank you.

231
00:15:56.253 --> 00:15:57.378
Uh, "thank you"?

232
00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:01.503
If it weren't for you and the champagne,

233
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.670
I probably wouldn't have found
a way to escape from there.


234
00:16:05.253 --> 00:16:06.670
You were impressive, though.

235
00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:09.961
I wouldn't even have lasted
a second in there.


236
00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.128
So you overheard us?

237
00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:14.711
I didn't mean to, but I heard.

238
00:16:16.545 --> 00:16:18.003
Waitstaff's always invisible.

239
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:20.961
I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:22.378 --> 00:16:24.659
Let's promise to stop apologizing
and thanking each other.


241
00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:27.336
You've escaped,
and that's all that matters.


242
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.295
Thank you.

243
00:16:28.378 --> 00:16:30.836
I apologize.
Wait, we just promised...


244
00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:34.336
Did we promise each other something?

245
00:16:39.836 --> 00:16:40.836
Have a good night.

246
00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:47.336
Ania?

247
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:51.711
Ania.

248
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:12.961
You made quite a scene.
You made me look like a monster.


249
00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:16.295
Did you have to involve everyone
in our... our family problems?


250
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:19.086
But we did have an agreement
that one day...


251
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:23.795
I mean, one day,
you'd come work at my practice.


252
00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:28.545
You know I get worried.

253
00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:31.878
What are you so worried about?
Me having an opinion?


254
00:17:32.628 --> 00:17:35.336
It's like your greatest fear is
me having a thought of my own.


255
00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:37.461
I want you to be taken care of.

256
00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:42.753
- I do feel taken care of.
- Mmm.


257
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.420
Too taken care of.

258
00:17:46.003 --> 00:17:47.295
Antek!

259
00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:52.503
Honey, calm down.

260
00:17:53.628 --> 00:17:56.920
- Please, it's your turn now.
- Here. I got him.


261
00:17:57.003 --> 00:17:58.420
Oh.

262
00:17:58.503 --> 00:18:01.503
- Are you sure?
- Baby boy. Hey, you wanna come with me?


263
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:06.045
Come on. Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

264
00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:16.812
Jesus.

265
00:19:16.836 --> 00:19:18.312
- Oh, I'll wipe it off.
- Wait.


266
00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:20.545
I'll take him. I'll take him. Here. Here.

267
00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:22.920
And now Daddy would like to eat something.

268
00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:25.128
I gotta eat too,
from time to time.


269
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.795
Good, good, good.

270
00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:29.211
- Let me feed him.
- No, I can manage. Thank you.


271
00:19:29.295 --> 00:19:30.295
I can manage.

272
00:19:32.003 --> 00:19:34.503
Okay. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you out.


273
00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:38.003
- It's just a spill. Everybody spills.
- Oh, I... Listen, girls. Yoga.


274
00:19:38.086 --> 00:19:40.753
- What do you say?
- Come here, sweetie. Hold on, Antoś.


275
00:19:40.836 --> 00:19:42.128
- Yoga?
- Mm-hmm.


276
00:19:43.586 --> 00:19:44.795
You could use some yoga.

277
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:46.920
But it says here these are

278
00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:52.211
special classes for women who would like
to discover their inner peace and balance.


279
00:19:52.295 --> 00:19:55.461
I can discover inner peace and balance
lying on a deck chair.


280
00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.545
Hello.

281
00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:01.836
Excuse me.
Can I please get a glass?


282
00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.211
Okay, okay, okay. Sand, sand...

283
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:07.420
Patrycja, why don't we go?

284
00:20:08.003 --> 00:20:09.961
'Cause I'd feel weird going alone.

285
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.211
Yeah, no way. I'm going to be lying
on a deck chair all day.


286
00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:16.253
Dad can take care of Antek.

287
00:20:16.336 --> 00:20:17.545
They'll be able to bond.

288
00:20:19.628 --> 00:20:21.711
Hmm. Want to get
to know your son better?

289
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:27.961
- Here. Get to know each other.
- What would you like to eat?


290
00:20:28.045 --> 00:20:30.253
- Let's go.
- Let's get cheese.


291
00:20:30.336 --> 00:20:32.670
- Bye. Good luck, boys.
- We'll get some cheese.


292
00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:35.586
And, well... Mm-hmm.

293
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.878
What do you want to eat?

294
00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:40.503
You want cheese?
This cheese is dripping with juice, see?


295
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:45.961
They're hiding from me.

296
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:48.420
I've sent them off to yoga.

297
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.503
And the next time, I'll think twice
before I suggest they leave him with me.


298
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:54.920
Hold him, please. Here.

299
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:56.003
Uh...

300
00:20:57.211 --> 00:20:58.211
Upsie-up!

301
00:21:02.586 --> 00:21:04.836
I don't think Ania likes being around me.

302
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.628
I hadn't noticed.

303
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.961
You haven't seen each other in a while.

304
00:21:10.045 --> 00:21:11.045
She's avoiding me.

305
00:21:11.128 --> 00:21:14.378
You don't have to be so dramatic.
You see each other twice a year.


306
00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:16.128
Hmm.

307
00:21:19.128 --> 00:21:20.753
Does she still play the piano?

308
00:21:20.836 --> 00:21:22.461
Sometimes.

309
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.187
But I think I managed
to talk her out of trying to be a pianist.


310
00:21:27.211 --> 00:21:30.628
The artistic life really isn't for her.
Constant stress, the touring...


311
00:21:32.003 --> 00:21:35.086
To be a successful artist,
you need to have a very thick skin.


312
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.003
And a huge ego.

313
00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:40.128
Oh, no.

314
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:42.545
Gentlemen, please let me
take care of the baby.


315
00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:44.295
We looked into your request,

316
00:21:44.378 --> 00:21:47.086
and we offer the services
of a professional babysitter.


317
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.045
Yes. We also have
a wonderful daycare program


318
00:21:50.128 --> 00:21:52.336
for our little ones. Yes.

319
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.586
A fantastic one.

320
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.336
- Oh.
- Come on.


321
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.586
Aw, there you are.

322
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.586
No need to cry. 
Come on, let's smile.

323
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.253
Let's smile a little. Yes. There.

324
00:22:03.336 --> 00:22:04.628
Bye-bye, Antoś.

325
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:05.961
Bye.

326
00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:08.045
Oh, come with me.

327
00:22:08.128 --> 00:22:10.086
What is that. Hey, look.

328
00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:20.336
<i>♪ How do you know that's the feeling
That you feel exactly ♪</i>


329
00:22:21.336 --> 00:22:25.170
<i>♪ How do you know that's the feeling
That you feel exactly ♪</i>


330
00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:26.920
<i>♪ How do you
know that's the feeling ♪</i>

331
00:22:38.045 --> 00:22:40.003
- In order to turn right...
- Oh.


332
00:22:40.086 --> 00:22:43.878
...pull with your right hand, like that,
while letting go with your left hand.


333
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:45.336
Then move the entire rig...

334
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.646
- And then?
- ...to the right here.


335
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.045
When you want to go left,
you do the same thing.


336
00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:50.128
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.


337
00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:52.253
- Think you got it, Miss Aldona?
- Uh-huh.


338
00:22:52.753 --> 00:22:53.961
But you can call me Aldona.

339
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:57.128
So, when are we gonna fly?

340
00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.295
I think we've got time for that.

341
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:04.420
Well, Mikey-boy?
Are we heading out or what?


342
00:23:04.503 --> 00:23:06.086
- We are.
- What's going on here?


343
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.795
Yes, we are. Of course we are.

344
00:23:07.878 --> 00:23:11.128
Okay. Listen, ladies.
Oh, and gentlemen. Can't forget them.


345
00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:13.211
Can you please all gather 'round here?

346
00:23:13.295 --> 00:23:16.961
Uh, and our surf team's gonna take
excellent care of all of you today.


347
00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:20.586
We'll explain the basics
for staying safe out in the water.


348
00:23:21.836 --> 00:23:24.961
We'll explain how to safely
and properly use all the equipment.


349
00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:27.045
Um, why don't you come join us?

350
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.086
No. We're here for yoga.

351
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.920
Unfortunately, there's no yoga today.
Our colleague is sick.


352
00:23:33.003 --> 00:23:35.086
But we do have kites here. 
Wanna join us?

353
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.586
Oh, no. We have no gear or anything.

354
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.045
We have everything here.

355
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.253
Come on.
Don't make us beg.


356
00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:44.878
Hey, we're ready.

357
00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:46.711
We'll get you into a wet-suit.

358
00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:47.878
- Me?
- Right.


359
00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:50.420
The zipper's on the back.

360
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.086
- Ah!
- On the back. Yeah.


361
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.253
Everybody sees, nobody tells me.

362
00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:57.136
Bodzio,
why don't you get us started?


363
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.045
First, we'll find you a harness.

364
00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:06.461
A small or an extra-small?

365
00:24:07.503 --> 00:24:08.878
Medium.

366
00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:12.836
Uh, try this extra-small.

367
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.920
No, turn it. Mm-hmm.

368
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:24.961
Very well done.

369
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:27.545
But it's upside-down.

370
00:24:29.378 --> 00:24:31.128
- May I?
- Yeah.


371
00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:38.336
Uh, you'd better exhale now.

372
00:24:44.128 --> 00:24:46.045
- It's okay? Not too tight?
- Yeah.


373
00:24:46.628 --> 00:24:47.628
Okay.

374
00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:55.170
Who are you, anyway?

375
00:24:56.378 --> 00:24:58.586
A surfer? A waiter?

376
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.253
And you?

377
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.045
Right now, I'm just your student.

378
00:25:12.586 --> 00:25:13.920
Please lean backwards.

379
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:18.878
It's okay?

380
00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:21.003
- Yes? That's okay?
- Yeah.


381
00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.461
Ready? But, uh...

382
00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:26.711
Michał, what should we take?

383
00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:27.795
Um...

384
00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:30.920
J-Just take some tens.
Hey, get me 13, please.


385
00:25:31.003 --> 00:25:32.378
We can always switch later.

386
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:33.461
All right.

387
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.336
I definitely prefer
teaching on this beach here.


388
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.753
Currently, the wind is from the north.
Might be a little chilly for you.


389
00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:43.920
I don't think you're gonna need those.

390
00:25:44.003 --> 00:25:45.586
- And over there?
- Really windy.


391
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.753
Back there's the bay?

392
00:25:47.503 --> 00:25:48.503
Exactly.

393
00:25:53.878 --> 00:25:55.086
The wind's really forceful,

394
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.211
but if you're able to control that,
it's not gonna hurt you.


395
00:25:58.711 --> 00:25:59.795
There.

396
00:25:59.878 --> 00:26:02.753
So now I'm gonna go
in little circles, just like this.


397
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.836
And whenever you feel like you're ready...

398
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.461
- No. Ready for...
- ...then feel free to take control of it.


399
00:26:09.545 --> 00:26:10.836
- No.
- I'll go slowly.


400
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.420
Now, I'm letting go with one hand.

401
00:26:13.503 --> 00:26:15.170
- Steer it. Steer it.
- Ah.


402
00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:17.045
- Ah!
- Uh-huh.


403
00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:18.878
All right. To the left. All right.

404
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:20.920
I'm releasing my hand, more and more.

405
00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:23.045
That's good.

406
00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:26.170
Oh!

407
00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:28.586
No! Help me. Hold it, please.

408
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.503
- Hold on. All right.
- Go right.


409
00:26:30.586 --> 00:26:31.937
- Keep holding on.
- I'm holding on.


410
00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:33.420
- Got me?
- Yeah.


411
00:26:34.753 --> 00:26:37.420
And if we wanna
just turn a little bit more,


412
00:26:37.503 --> 00:26:39.045
you can feel it gain speed.

413
00:26:39.128 --> 00:26:41.048
It builds up even more force.

414
00:26:41.086 --> 00:26:42.420
You see? You see that?

415
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420
See?

416
00:26:57.545 --> 00:26:59.586
Make sure you put sunscreen on.

417
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.586
I don't want you to get sunburned.
Remember last time?


418
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.420
Do you remember that kid?

419
00:27:04.503 --> 00:27:06.878
That one I was always super jealous of.

420
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:09.253
He kept
following you everywhere,


421
00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:10.545
and whenever he saw you,

422
00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.045
he kept saying how you were

423
00:27:12.128 --> 00:27:15.378
the most beautiful girl
in the whole, entire hotel.


424
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.295
Asshole.

425

<i>♪ 'Cause I'm a legend ♪</i>

426
00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:30.003
And if you remember,
I just couldn't take it.


427
00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:33.295
I beat his ass and told him
you were my girlfriend.


428
00:27:36.836 --> 00:27:40.795
<i>♪ I'll be here through the end ♪</i>

429

430

431
00:27:46.878 --> 00:27:50.378
You don't have to
start your whole career from scratch.


432
00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.378
It's just easier.

I can't imagine being anything else.


435
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:03.128

Ania!

442
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.086
Don't go under for so long.
You know it makes me worried.


443
00:29:04.878 --> 00:29:07.003
She really is acting kind of weird.

444
00:29:07.086 --> 00:29:09.211
- What'd you say?
- What? Me?


445
00:29:10.628 --> 00:29:11.628
Nothing.

446
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.336
Huh. It crushed on me again.

447
00:29:24.003 --> 00:29:25.086
Crashed on you.

448
00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:27.586
Crashed on me.

449
00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:37.961
Mm-hmm. It's ready now.

450
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.670
Thank you.

451
00:29:43.628 --> 00:29:46.086
Er, I don't know if you remember,

452
00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:48.378
but when you were younger,

453
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:54.086
when you came here s-straight inside
from the... the swimming pool,


454
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.253
you would have me
sit you up on the counter


455
00:29:57.336 --> 00:30:02.628
and... and you wanted to check in
and greet all the guests with me.


456
00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:16.336
And one time, your mama,

457
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.961
when she saw you like that...

458
00:30:19.045 --> 00:30:20.795
Instead of scolding you...

459
00:30:20.878 --> 00:30:24.003
...she jumped up on the counter,

460
00:30:24.086 --> 00:30:28.711
and together, you dangled your bare feet.

461
00:30:28.795 --> 00:30:31.753
You should have seen all the guests.

462
00:30:31.836 --> 00:30:34.420
Oh.

463
00:30:34.503 --> 00:30:35.711
Mama.

464
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.420
Come on.

465
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.378
I'll show you something.

466
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.836
I haven't played in forever.

467
00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.961
I'm not a musician,

468
00:31:58.795 --> 00:32:01.961
but I don't think
it's something you can forget.


469
00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:11.920
- Watch the handle. Take it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


470
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:15.128
I got it. When
are you gonna repair it?

471
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.670
You handling it?

472
00:32:19.753 --> 00:32:21.878

- It's being taken care of.

481
00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:54.628
This is the classic problem.

482
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:56.961
You got all the
plates, but not the food.

483
00:32:57.045 --> 00:32:58.628
You'll handle it, right?

484
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.003
There, did you hear that? Big props.

485

There you are.

495
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:36.795
So, I, uh, heard that Gąssowski's
giving a concert this evening.


496
00:33:37.503 --> 00:33:39.503
I hear you like
him, or your mother did.

497
00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:41.920
I have to stay here with Antek.

What do you want?

499
00:33:49.753 --> 00:33:50.961
Excuse me.

500
00:33:51.753 --> 00:33:52.753
Ugh.

501
00:33:59.711 --> 00:34:01.170
I don't know what's going on.

502
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.378
- Do I annoy you?
- You don't annoy me. It's not that.


503
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:08.336
I'd actually prefer
not to do anything at all.


504
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.670
But you don't have to do anything.
Just listen to the music.

Where's your mother?

507
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:37.378
I don't know.

508
00:34:43.336 --> 00:34:46.420
And Ania didn't change her mind, did she?

509
00:34:46.503 --> 00:34:49.003
Couldn't a babysitter
have stayed with Antek?


510
00:34:49.503 --> 00:34:50.628
Yeah. We got a sitter.

511
00:34:51.211 --> 00:34:53.211

- Hi.
- Hi. So glad you joined us.


530
00:37:12.628 --> 00:37:14.628
You know some of our crew. Maniana.

531
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:16.211
- Hi.
- What's up?


532
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.295
- Bodzio.
- Hey there.


533
00:37:18.378 --> 00:37:19.378
Hey.

534
00:37:20.378 --> 00:37:22.045
This is my girlfriend, Kalina.

535
00:37:22.128 --> 00:37:23.503
- Kalina.
- Ania.


536
00:37:23.586 --> 00:37:24.628
This is Sasza.

537
00:37:25.836 --> 00:37:26.836
Ania.

538
00:37:27.295 --> 00:37:29.420
Ania's one of our trainees
from the hotel.


539
00:37:29.503 --> 00:37:31.253
Girl from the hotel? She's brave.

540
00:37:31.961 --> 00:37:33.711
Sasza is from Ukraine.

541
00:37:33.795 --> 00:37:36.128
She lives here,
and she studies in the Tricity.


542
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:37.961
And she's a close friend of Michał's.

543
00:37:38.045 --> 00:37:40.670
Actually, she's our friend too.
She's awesome at kite-surfing.


544
00:37:40.753 --> 00:37:43.878
Actually, she's even better
than Maniana and Bodzio.


545
00:37:44.586 --> 00:37:45.586
What's up, guys?

546
00:37:47.586 --> 00:37:48.836
Listen up, guys.

547
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.295
Here with me, with
us, with all of us,

548
00:37:51.378 --> 00:37:53.295
a very good friend of mine, Mateusz.

549
00:37:53.378 --> 00:37:55.503
And he's here with his band Bitamina.

550
00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:56.670
Have you heard of them?

551
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.003
Here with me tonight is Michał.

552
00:38:01.086 --> 00:38:03.795
Not from the band Bitamina.
Have you guys heard of him?


553
00:38:03.878 --> 00:38:04.711
Nope.

554
00:38:07.378 --> 00:38:09.128
All right, are we ready?

555
00:38:14.628 --> 00:38:15.961

Watch out. She's the same
as that chick from last year.


592
00:40:57.211 --> 00:41:00.170
What if you get your heart broken
and you get depressed like last time?


593
00:41:00.253 --> 00:41:01.170
She's different.

594
00:41:01.253 --> 00:41:05.420
Michał, every chick from the hotel
is different, right? Different than us.


595
00:41:05.503 --> 00:41:06.503
Make some noise!

596
00:41:10.378 --> 00:41:14.086
That's right! Uh-huh.

597

598
00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:21.378
Maniana!

599
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.170
Come on!

600
00:41:23.253 --> 00:41:25.920
Whoo! All right!

601
00:41:26.003 --> 00:41:28.628
- Wow!
- There he goes.


602
00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:29.711
There he goes.

603
00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:33.128
Maniana,
let's go surfing in the morning!


604
00:41:33.211 --> 00:41:36.211
Hey, who gets up that early
just to go surfing?


605
00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:38.420
- Got a joint?
- Yeah.


606
00:41:39.211 --> 00:41:40.545
Dude, listen.

607
00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:43.461
If I'm supposed to start teaching at 9:00,

608
00:41:43.961 --> 00:41:46.086
then I have to be up at 7:30.

609
00:41:46.586 --> 00:41:49.545
So in any case,
I'm not sleeping much tonight.


610
00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:51.711
Not much difference if
I get up at 5:00,

611
00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:53.628
but at least I'll be surfing.

612
00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:56.253
Empty spot. Sun will be low then.

613
00:41:56.336 --> 00:41:58.336
I'll be on the water till 7:30.

614
00:41:59.128 --> 00:42:00.503
At 8:00 I'll drink coffee.

615
00:42:01.878 --> 00:42:03.545
And then I'll just be like,

616
00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:08.045
"I've had a fucking awesome morning."

617
00:42:09.753 --> 00:42:10.753
That makes sense.

618
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:12.795
You want a hit?

619
00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:15.003
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

620
00:42:15.086 --> 00:42:16.586
Maybe it's time to start.

621
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.795
And maybe it's time
for you to chill out.

622
00:42:19.295 --> 00:42:22.045
But I'll take a hit of that.
Come on, sit down.


623
00:42:25.628 --> 00:42:28.211
So, still going surfing?

624
00:42:28.795 --> 00:42:31.920
7:30, 8:00, 9:00,
that's a boring morning.


625
00:42:32.003 --> 00:42:33.711
- Go on.
- But five o'clock...


626
00:42:33.795 --> 00:42:36.211
- Go on.
- ...7:30, 8:00, nine o'clock.


627
00:42:36.295 --> 00:42:38.586
Fucking awesome morning.

628
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.836
That's dope.

629
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.711
I should get back.

630
00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:46.586
You wanna come?
You can still say yes.


631
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.545
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.


632
00:42:50.753 --> 00:42:52.170
I'll be going too. See you.

633
00:42:52.253 --> 00:42:54.003
- Bye.
- Sasza.


634
00:42:55.503 --> 00:42:57.628
I might not look like I'm a bodyguard,

635
00:42:57.711 --> 00:43:00.378
but I'm not going to let you
walk home alone at night.


636
00:44:10.128 --> 00:44:11.545
You really scared me.

637
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:15.586
You're the one who scared me.

638
00:44:17.628 --> 00:44:21.211
Mmm. I had to go... get some air.

639
00:44:24.586 --> 00:44:26.586
Freaks me out whenever you disappear.

640
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:32.878
And I get upset...

641
00:44:35.711 --> 00:44:37.336
when you try to control me.

642
00:44:40.128 --> 00:44:41.420
I'm an adult now.

643
00:44:41.503 --> 00:44:43.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm?


644
00:44:44.086 --> 00:44:45.170
Mmm.

645
00:44:48.045 --> 00:44:50.670
You're the most important person
in the world to me.


646
00:44:53.836 --> 00:44:55.795
And I would never forgive myself

647
00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:58.961
if your depression came back.

648
00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:05.170
Don't worry.

649
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.503
I'm just a little bit tired.

650
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.753
I know that smell.

651
00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:27.878
Oh-ho-ho! Where are you going?

652
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:29.670
I'm gonna get you,

653
00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:33.711
and then we're gonna build
a huge sand castle!


654
00:46:56.295 --> 00:46:57.295
Uncle?

655
00:46:58.711 --> 00:46:59.711
Hey, Kuba.

656
00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:02.503
Have you seen Ania?
I've been looking for her.


657
00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:03.836
She wasn't at breakfast.

658
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.420
She was sleeping like a log
when we left. I didn't want to wake her.


659
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.086
Ania had a really hard time.

660
00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:22.211
It's been hard for me to reach her,
to get her out of her room,


661
00:47:22.295 --> 00:47:23.795
but I'm not giving up.

662
00:47:23.878 --> 00:47:24.878
Hmm.

663
00:47:32.336 --> 00:47:34.378
Just give her a little more time, hmm?

664
00:47:38.503 --> 00:47:39.503
Antoś.

665
00:47:41.545 --> 00:47:44.628
Okay, now we're flying. 
Now we're flying.

666
00:48:06.753 --> 00:48:10.045
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
I didn't want to disturb you.


667
00:48:10.128 --> 00:48:11.253
I'll come back later.

668
00:48:11.336 --> 00:48:14.170
No, no, please don't mind me.
I gotta go soon anyway.


669
00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:23.170
I'll come back.

670
00:48:33.753 --> 00:48:35.420
Uh, have a good day.

671
00:48:35.503 --> 00:48:36.503
Goodbye.

672
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.586
Thank you very much. Ania. Hi.

673
00:48:40.336 --> 00:48:41.753
- Olga.
- Hi there.


674
00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.711
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.


675
00:48:45.295 --> 00:48:48.128
...ate an ice cream
and miraculously got better!


676
00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:50.503
Ice cream! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!


677
00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:52.211
- How much?
- A fiver.


678
00:48:52.295 --> 00:48:53.836
Oh, no thanks.

679
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.420
An old man was sick,
lying in his deathbed.


680
00:48:57.503 --> 00:49:00.336
He refused to eat ice cream
and he quickly died.


681
00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.336
Ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream!

682
00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.420
Corn on the cob,
corn on the cob!


683
00:49:05.503 --> 00:49:08.545
Twice a week
and your sex drive is the best!


684
00:49:08.628 --> 00:49:12.670
For a woman, for a man!
Corn cob, hot on the grill!


685
00:49:14.003 --> 00:49:16.670
Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream!


686
00:51:21.795 --> 00:51:23.086
Look.

687
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.045
Take the lollipop out.

688
00:51:49.336 --> 00:51:51.878
Take out the lollipop
so he doesn't skewer himself.


689
00:52:13.336 --> 00:52:15.812
Fresh fruit that's been
sun-ripened in southern Italy.


690
00:52:15.836 --> 00:52:17.628
Thank you. I'm not that hungry.

691
00:52:52.545 --> 00:52:54.836
- Ready?
- Watch that serve.


692
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920
Up here. Good.

693
00:52:56.503 --> 00:52:57.920
- Okay, hit it.
- Michał, play.


694
00:52:58.003 --> 00:53:00.920
- Michał, come on!
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry.


695
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:04.920
There, got it!

696
00:53:05.003 --> 00:53:06.003
Whoo!

697
00:53:06.086 --> 00:53:08.045
- Oh!
- That's good!


698
00:53:10.795 --> 00:53:13.503
- I prefer the kite, okay?
- Sure.


699
00:53:13.586 --> 00:53:14.670
Right here.

700
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.211
Michał, what's wrong?

701
00:53:30.128 --> 00:53:33.086
- Go, go. It's fine. Go ahead.
- All right. Are we packing up?


702
00:54:10.961 --> 00:54:11.961
Can I?

703
00:54:14.045 --> 00:54:15.045
Come in.

704
00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:20.253
I think we need to talk.

705
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:23.128
No need.

706
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.420
But if you want to.

707
00:54:29.836 --> 00:54:32.503
- You barricaded yourself in your room.
- I did not.


708
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:39.211
You know, I understand one day. Two.
But it's been quite a while, you know?


709
00:54:41.086 --> 00:54:42.420
I just need some time.

710
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:46.670
Okay.

711
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.420
All right.

712
00:54:56.295 --> 00:54:59.586
I just can't sit through any more meals

713
00:55:00.086 --> 00:55:04.128
constantly hearing Antoś screaming
"Where's Ania?" over and over


714
00:55:05.128 --> 00:55:08.545
So, either you eat downstairs with us,

715
00:55:08.628 --> 00:55:10.461
or I stay up here with you.

716
00:55:10.961 --> 00:55:11.961
Up to you.

717
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.295
- You don't have any pride, do you?
- None.


718
00:55:28.836 --> 00:55:30.295
At least look me in the eyes.

719
00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:32.670
Okay, I'm looking.

720
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:36.170
Still the most beautiful girl
in the world.


721
00:55:38.086 --> 00:55:39.420
I'm gonna stay right here.

722
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920
Kuba.

723
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:30.711
Yeah?

724
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.731
I know we haven't discussed this much,

725
00:56:32.795 --> 00:56:36.086
but I was wondering if you could clarify
how much you value women.


726
00:56:37.336 --> 00:56:39.128
Oh, thank you very much.

727
00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:42.253
What women?

728
00:56:44.086 --> 00:56:46.253
There's only one woman
who matters to me.


729
00:56:48.045 --> 00:56:51.795
Ever since we began talking,
we agreed you'd be my girlfriend, right?


730
00:56:55.045 --> 00:56:57.503
And you remember
our little wedding at the beach?


731
00:56:59.336 --> 00:57:00.753
- Hmm?
- Of course I do.


732
00:57:00.836 --> 00:57:02.045
We should do that again.

733
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.170
Well, how about now?

734
00:57:05.503 --> 00:57:08.628
Jakub, I think that maybe

735
00:57:08.711 --> 00:57:12.461
it's now time
for our little surprise here.


736
00:57:13.045 --> 00:57:15.295
Kuba was just waiting
for the right moment.


737
00:57:15.378 --> 00:57:16.378
Excuse me.

738
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:18.586
Um,

739
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:20.711
except you... you suddenly disappeared.

740
00:57:20.795 --> 00:57:22.086
Well, I'm back now.

741
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:23.878
- Hmm.
- Kuba?


742
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:28.503
Ania.

743
00:57:29.086 --> 00:57:31.336
I can't imagine
living my life without you.


744
00:57:33.961 --> 00:57:37.545
That's why me and my parents decided
that I will not move out of London.


745
00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:39.336
We're not gonna rent out our flat.

746
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.836
You can stay there with me,

747
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.003
and we can get
to know each other better.

748
00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:48.295
We could start
building a life together, and...


749
00:58:00.295 --> 00:58:01.295
Ania!

750
00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.336
Well, it seems like all that therapy
didn't work so well.


751
00:58:05.211 --> 00:58:07.461
Can you please keep
your opinions to yourself?


752
00:58:07.545 --> 00:58:08.961
You could use it too.

753
00:58:09.045 --> 00:58:10.461
Sex addiction is treatable.

754
00:59:06.128 --> 00:59:08.128
Oh, Mama, help.

755
01:01:17.711 --> 01:01:19.503
I know it's been hard for you.

756
01:01:20.378 --> 01:01:21.836
I certainly see it.

757
01:01:22.503 --> 01:01:26.170
Um, I was thinking about you.

758
01:01:26.253 --> 01:01:30.336
Especially since I have
a stepdaughter your age.


759
01:01:32.295 --> 01:01:33.711
You have a daughter?

760
01:01:34.295 --> 01:01:36.128
You've never even talked about her.

761
01:01:37.545 --> 01:01:41.670
How should I, uh, say it. Um...

762
01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:47.711
Um, a-a couple of ago, um,

763
01:01:48.378 --> 01:01:49.711
I fell in love.

764
01:01:49.795 --> 01:01:54.836
And, um, this old widower ended up

765
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.295
with a beautiful woman with a child.

766
01:02:00.378 --> 01:02:02.753
Oh.

767
01:02:06.045 --> 01:02:08.753
I'm so sorry.
I got my snot all over your suit.


768
01:02:08.836 --> 01:02:11.128
Oh. No... no matter.

769
01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:14.586
I'll leave your tears as a souvenir.

770
01:02:16.336 --> 01:02:18.336
And you know, I...

771
01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:21.836
Earlier, I
-I saw...

772
01:02:22.336 --> 01:02:25.878
I saw Michał running out of the hotel.

773
01:02:25.961 --> 01:02:27.920
And he looked unusually upset.

774
01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.003
You
-You really like him, don't you?

775
01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:33.878
He's a good boy,

776
01:02:34.378 --> 01:02:36.003
but he's very sensitive.

777
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.920
I owe a lot to him.

778
01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.795
He was the one
that took care of my stepdaughter


779
01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:43.086
when she came here from Ukraine.

780
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.003
And not knowing the language
or any people here...


781
01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:49.878
And he got her into kite-surfing,

782
01:02:49.961 --> 01:02:51.836
into his group of friends.

783
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.878
And from then on,
he's been... he's been her best friend.


784
01:02:57.586 --> 01:02:59.461
And what's the name of your daughter?

785
01:03:00.295 --> 01:03:01.461
It's Sasza.

786
01:03:13.295 --> 01:03:14.628
I love you, Mr. Miron.

787
01:03:14.711 --> 01:03:15.920
Mmm. Ah.

- Ready? Merry Christmas!
- Happy holidays!


801
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920
Hey, cheers.

802
01:04:09.003 --> 01:04:11.711
Sasza,
just give me a minute, okay? Excuse me.


803
01:04:13.586 --> 01:04:15.295
Happy holidays, you guys.

804
01:04:27.086 --> 01:04:29.545
We're never able
to meet up during Christmas-time,


805
01:04:30.878 --> 01:04:32.503
and we all really wish we could.

806
01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.628
So, that's why every July 24th,

807
01:04:35.711 --> 01:04:37.711
we meet up and have our own.

808
01:04:38.295 --> 01:04:39.920
Our own Christmas together.

809
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:41.711
With chosen family.

810
01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:45.795
And we'll have to do this again.
Maybe, like, next weekend? Sound good?


811
01:04:46.336 --> 01:04:48.795
Yeah! Oh, that'd be awesome.

812
01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.253
Michał?

813
01:04:57.503 --> 01:04:58.711
I'm sorry.

814
01:05:05.086 --> 01:05:07.836
Yeah!

815
01:05:10.545 --> 01:05:12.545
Can you pass the wafers, Sasza?

816
01:05:12.628 --> 01:05:15.586
- Right, wafers.
- We got wafers, so we can continue.


817
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.295
- All right!
- You forgot the wafers!


818
01:05:19.003 --> 01:05:20.253
For you.

819
01:05:26.878 --> 01:05:28.253
I hope that you...

820
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:33.670
I hope you can stop being afraid.

821
01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:39.961
That you start
believing in yourself and others.


822
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:45.045
Believing in the kind of people
who are always kind to each other.


823
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:48.503
I don't want to cause you pain.

824
01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.920
I don't want you to ever doubt yourself
and your worth, or forget who you are.


825
01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:57.170
You're good.

826
01:05:58.711 --> 01:05:59.795
Clever...

827
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.170
sweet,

828
01:06:03.878 --> 01:06:04.878

830
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.795
Merry Christmas.

831
01:06:23.586 --> 01:06:25.378
Hey there, hey.

832
01:06:25.461 --> 01:06:27.461
- Oh, hi.
- Happy holidays to you.


833
01:06:28.378 --> 01:06:29.878
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

834
01:06:29.961 --> 01:06:33.086
I know you're gonna
do amazing in the competition.


835
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.211
- Health and happiness.
- I'm glad you're here.


836
01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:37.170
I'm trying to do something.

837
01:06:37.253 --> 01:06:40.086
A lot of health, happiness,
and positive energy.


838
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:42.711
It's gonna be fine.
Everything will be fine.


839
01:06:42.795 --> 01:06:46.920
- A lot of wind in your kite...
- A thousand gusty beaches.


840
01:06:52.336 --> 01:06:53.336
Thanks.

867
01:12:23.086 --> 01:12:26.295
and we might as well not be here at all,
and you wouldn't even notice, Andre.


868
01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.420
Yes.

869

Stop it. You're an adult.

01:12:43.128 --> 01:12:44.670
So is she, Andre.

874
01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:04.753
Usually for me,
it takes me months


875
01:13:05.586 --> 01:13:07.045
to be able to trust someone.

876
01:13:14.003 --> 01:13:15.420
So tell me, how'd you do it?

877

My mom passed away five years ago.

881
01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:09.753
Cancer.

882
01:14:18.795 --> 01:14:21.128
At the beginning
of my senior year of high school...


883
01:14:23.545 --> 01:14:25.170
something inside me just froze.

884
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.003
My whole life collapsed,

885
01:14:27.086 --> 01:14:30.461
and I stopped studying, eating, sleeping.

886
01:14:39.836 --> 01:14:41.545
And what was she like, your mom?

887
01:14:49.253 --> 01:14:50.253
Amazing.

888
01:14:58.711 --> 01:14:59.920
She was cheerful.

889
01:15:05.253 --> 01:15:06.378
Independent.

890
01:15:12.211 --> 01:15:13.211
Warm.

891
01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.420
And smart.

892
01:15:24.545 --> 01:15:27.128
She made friends with everyone instantly.

893
01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:39.836
She was a jazz singer.

894
01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920
She was great.

Yeah, yeah.

- You remember it all?
- We'll find out.

Bravo! Bravo!

925
01:18:22.461 --> 01:18:24.253
Whoo!

926
01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:46.336
Are you having fun?

927
01:18:47.253 --> 01:18:49.170
I haven't had so
much fun a long time.

928
01:18:49.795 --> 01:18:51.128
So what happens now?

929
01:18:52.628 --> 01:18:53.670
What do you mean?

930
01:18:54.253 --> 01:18:57.670
Now you'll go back to your normal life
and forget all about this fun?


931
01:19:01.545 --> 01:19:02.545
You don't know me.

932
01:19:02.586 --> 01:19:05.295
Last year, there was
another rich girl hanging with us.


933
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:08.836
Michał fell in love.
But when he went after her to Warsaw,


934
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.670
she pretended she didn't know him.

935
01:19:16.295 --> 01:19:17.295
Leave it.

936
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:24.295
I know you are
a good friend to him.

937
01:19:25.045 --> 01:19:26.045
Yes, I guess I am.

938
01:19:26.878 --> 01:19:30.003
That's why I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get him out of a dark place again.


939
01:19:30.086 --> 01:19:32.711
I don't know what'll happen now,
and neither do you,


940
01:19:32.795 --> 01:19:34.670
but I don't play with
other people's emotions.


941
01:19:38.128 --> 01:19:39.170
Take it from here?

942
01:19:50.211 --> 01:19:52.628
- Smoke it up!
- Oh, yeah!


943
01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:55.187
- Roll it up!
- You couldn't be more of a bum.


944
01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:57.420
No, not here. Shh. No, Maniana.

945
01:19:58.003 --> 01:19:59.003
Whatever.

946
01:20:03.128 --> 01:20:04.711
Hey, girl, that was fun.

947
01:20:08.045 --> 01:20:09.836
Yeah.

948
01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:42.878
I don't get it, though.

949
01:20:44.086 --> 01:20:45.170
What don't you get?

950
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:47.795
I... I sent you a text message.

951
01:20:47.878 --> 01:20:50.545
- Well, you didn't call.
- But I texted you, didn't I?


952
01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.420
I'm doing everything I can
to not worry you.


953
01:21:12.503 --> 01:21:14.378
- Hmm?
- I'm trying.


954
01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:19.420
I haven't been picking fights with people.
I don't party. I vacation with you.


955
01:21:19.503 --> 01:21:21.045
I'm going to med school.

956
01:21:26.253 --> 01:21:28.128
I can't keep on living this way,

957
01:21:28.211 --> 01:21:30.211
just trying to please everybody
all the time, Dad.


958
01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.628
I was always so
afraid of making you sad

959
01:21:40.253 --> 01:21:41.795
that I've worked on myself.

960
01:21:48.586 --> 01:21:50.420
I've undergone therapy.

961
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.086
And now it's your turn.

962
01:21:58.170 --> 01:21:59.795
Ania, I'm really trying here.

963
01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:04.795
You never said goodbye to Mom.

964
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.920
That's not true.

965
01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:13.961
You see her everywhere.

966
01:22:16.836 --> 01:22:17.836
In me.

967
01:22:19.461 --> 01:22:20.586
In Patrycja.

968
01:22:34.795 --> 01:22:35.795
You know, yesterday

969
01:22:37.378 --> 01:22:39.420
was the first day in a long time

970
01:22:43.045 --> 01:22:44.628
that I actually felt happy.

971
01:22:56.045 --> 01:22:57.128
I love you.

972
01:22:57.753 --> 01:22:58.753
And I'm here.

973
01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:10.253
All right, what do you wanna do?

974
01:23:14.003 --> 01:23:15.003
Dunno.

975
01:23:17.211 --> 01:23:19.086
- Everything's...
- Going too fast?


976
01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420
Going too fast.

977
01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:26.170
Hey, Dad?

978
01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:29.503
What, honey?

979
01:23:33.836 --> 01:23:35.003
I've fallen in love.

980
01:24:12.378 --> 01:24:13.253
Baby car?

981
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:35.961
Well, I would like
to apologize to all of you


982
01:24:36.961 --> 01:24:38.336
for my outburst.

983
01:24:40.503 --> 01:24:41.795
I was just surprised.

984
01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.670
But I didn't mean to offend anyone.

985
01:24:52.545 --> 01:24:56.128
Thank you so very much for the offer,
but I have to think it through.


986
01:24:57.253 --> 01:25:01.211
But Ania,
what is there to think about


987
01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:03.545
when this is the
best offer you could get?

988
01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:04.628
Stop it!

989
01:25:05.336 --> 01:25:08.753
Stop trying to arrange our lives for us.
Focus on your own life.


990
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.086
Son, what's with this behavior?

991
01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:13.836
You're talking about my behavior?

992
01:25:14.753 --> 01:25:16.461
And how about your own behavior?

993
01:25:16.545 --> 01:25:19.295
You're trying to impose
your opinions on everybody else.


994
01:25:23.003 --> 01:25:24.003
Excuse me.

995
01:25:30.128 --> 01:25:34.378
We'll have a little peace for an hour,
since Antoś is being taken care of, and...


996
01:25:34.461 --> 01:25:36.420
What are you... 
What are you doing?

997
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:38.378
I'm packing.

998
01:25:39.336 --> 01:25:41.211
What do you mean? For what? Why?

999
01:25:41.295 --> 01:25:42.295
Because I'm leaving!

1000
01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:48.503
- Patrycja, have you gone crazy? Now?
- Yeah, I'm the one who's crazy.


1001
01:25:49.128 --> 01:25:51.336
Your little girl can act out
in front of all the guests,


1002
01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.045
not come home for the night,
but I'm crazy? Of course. Fucking nuts!


1003
01:25:55.128 --> 01:25:56.628
Hey, hey, hey!

1004
01:25:56.711 --> 01:25:59.836
- I talked to her, and we...
- Doesn't look like it helped, Andre.


1005
01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:02.586
Everyone has to tiptoe around her
all the time.


1006
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:03.710
Everyone needs to be quiet

1007
01:26:03.753 --> 01:26:05.513
so her bullshit depression
doesn't come back.


1008
01:26:05.545 --> 01:26:06.545
- Come here.
- No!


1009
01:26:07.378 --> 01:26:11.628
I'm neither a doctor
nor an artist. I know.


1010
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:15.920
I cannot meet your expectations.

1011
01:26:16.003 --> 01:26:17.711
Just admit it. 
I cannot meet them.

1012
01:26:20.586 --> 01:26:23.795
I can never replace your wife
and I can never replace her mother.


1013
01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.378
You make sure I'm aware, every day.

1014
01:26:31.628 --> 01:26:33.461
Patrycja is right, you know, Dad.

1015
01:26:58.628 --> 01:26:59.670
I'm sorry.

1016
01:26:59.753 --> 01:27:00.878
[tender music playing

1017
01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.128
I'm sorry about everything.

1018
01:27:10.336 --> 01:27:12.336
I just didn't understand.

1019
01:29:26.045 --> 01:29:28.920
Sasza, have you seen Michał?

1020
01:29:30.586 --> 01:29:32.253
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

1021
01:29:37.295 --> 01:29:39.961
Come on. Michał asked me
to bring you over there.


1022
01:30:07.961 --> 01:30:12.045
And their names are
Józef Łazanka and Michał Kijowski.


1023
01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:14.003
All right, let's go.

Michał! Michał! Woo-hoo!

1038
01:32:23.045 --> 01:32:24.295
Yes!

1039
01:32:44.211 --> 01:32:45.711
- Oh, my God.
- Holy fuck.


1040
01:32:45.795 --> 01:32:46.878
- Is he okay?
- Michał!


1041
01:32:49.461 --> 01:32:50.545
Michał!

1042
01:34:03.878 --> 01:34:04.878
Ania.

1043
01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:47.336
Dad says they still
don't know anything yet.


1044
01:34:48.628 --> 01:34:50.586
They're supposed to call back tomorrow.

1045
01:34:54.836 --> 01:34:56.753
Sorry, I can't sit still.

1046
01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.670
Everyone wanted to come pick you up,

1047
01:36:09.753 --> 01:36:11.670
to drive that hunk of junk
to the hospital,


1048
01:36:11.753 --> 01:36:13.670
but I was able to
talk them out of it.

1049
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:21.503
Well, thank you very much.

1050
01:36:21.586 --> 01:36:23.045
No need for you to thank me.

1051
01:36:26.836 --> 01:36:29.628
I promised Ania I'd bring you back
in one piece.


1052
01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:35.586
Comfortable?

1053
01:36:36.503 --> 01:36:37.503
Yeah.

1054
01:36:39.295 --> 01:36:40.295
Very.

1055
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.670
Thank you.

1056
01:36:58.503 --> 01:37:00.545
- He lives!
- Hey.


1057
01:37:01.045 --> 01:37:02.336
He lives.

1058
01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.045
This really isn't necessary.

1059
01:37:04.128 --> 01:37:05.628
Mm-hmm. I'm the boss here,

1060
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.795
and the doctor told me
to keep a close eye on you.


1061
01:37:12.545 --> 01:37:13.753
You're alive!

1062
01:37:19.045 --> 01:37:20.211
You're alive.

1063
01:37:29.045 --> 01:37:31.503
Michał, let me know
if you need anything else.


1064
01:37:31.586 --> 01:37:32.670
Thank you.

1065
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:35.086
What was that?

1066
01:37:35.711 --> 01:37:37.836
- Hey, man.
- Hi. Good to see you.


1067
01:37:42.378 --> 01:37:44.295
Yeah. Chałupy, where you at?

1068
01:37:47.378 --> 01:37:49.170
Good, that's great.

1069
01:37:49.253 --> 01:37:52.878
So listen, for this next song here,
I'm gonna need some support.


1070
01:37:53.836 --> 01:37:55.920
And I know I've got
a real trooper here tonight,


1071
01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:58.003
so I'm trying to
find him in the crowd.

1072
01:37:58.086 --> 01:38:00.003
Where is that dude? Okay, Michał.

1073
01:38:00.086 --> 01:38:01.086
Get on up here.

1074
01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:02.670
Make some noise for Michał.

1075
01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:07.211
Come on, come on, come on.
Don't you run away from me.


1076

1077
01:38:10.461 --> 01:38:12.961
You know that? 
He's a legend.

1078
01:38:14.003 --> 01:38:15.628
He's got the chops, right?

1079
