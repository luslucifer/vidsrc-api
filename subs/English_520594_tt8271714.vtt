Welcome to Radio City Music Hall.

3
00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.799
It's time. Any questions?

4
00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.301
No.

5
00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:37.512
Walk with me.

6
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.700

[audience cheering]

10
00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:01.846
Good evening.

11
00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.935
Hi, I'm John Mulaney, nice to meet you.

12
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.773
Jon Brion, ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:02:15.693 --> 00:02:18.947
Thank you for coming to see me
at Radio City Music Hall.


14
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.533
I love to play venues where
if the guy that built the venue


15
00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:23.993
could see me on the stage,

16
00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.246
he would be a
little bit bummed about it.

17
00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:28.039
Look at this.

18
00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.875
This is so much nicer
than what I'm about to do.


19
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.876
It's really...

20
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:33.836
It's really tragic.

21
00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:38.675
What a historic and beautiful
and deeply haunted building this is.


22
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.427
I keep walking through cold spots
being like,


23
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:43.137
"I wonder who that used to be."

24
00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.557
I've never seen a ghost, by the way.

25
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.935
I asked my mom if
she'd ever seen a ghost.

26
00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:53.481
That's where we're at conversation-wise
in our relationship as a mother and son,


27
00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:56.693
because I'm 35 and I don't have
any children to talk about


28
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.195
and she doesn't understand my career.

29
00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:03.908
So I was home for Christmas and we were
just eating Triscuits in silence


30
00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.994
and I was staring at the floor
and I was like,


31
00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:08.913
"Well, here goes nothing.
'You ever seen a ghost?'"


32
00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.334
And my mom said, "Yes."

33
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.088
Which is the best answer.

34
00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.091
She said, "I never told you this before

35
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.095
but our house, when you were growing up,
was haunted."


36
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.181
I said, "Say more right now!"

37
00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.020
She said, "Outside you
and your brother's room,


38
00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:35.815
I used to see the ghost of a little girl
in a Victorian nightgown


39
00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:40.445
and then she would walk down the hallway
and then she would evaporate."


40
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.115
And then my dad said,
"Let's change the subject!"


41
00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:48.161
And I think he was just doing
that dad-thing of, like,


42
00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:53.249
"This is a weird topic and I want to talk
about a book I read about World War II."


43
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.338
But the way it came off was that
he definitely killed that little girl.


44
00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:01.883
"Let's change the subject!

45
00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.260
Why are we even talking about Penelope...

46
00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.971
or whatever her name was?

47
00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:08.848
I didn't kill her!

48
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.518
Whoever did kill her only did it
to protect her from this world."


49
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.856
None of us really know our fathers.
Anyway...


50
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.735
My dad is so weird.

51
00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:22.236
I'd love to meet him someday.

52
00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:26.949
You know, my friend was telling me
that his dad used to beat him with a belt


53
00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.452
and that's just the setup
to my story, so...


54
00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.163
Forget about that poor son of a bitch.
Anyway...


55
00:04:32.914 --> 00:04:35.708
He was talking and I was waiting
for him to be done so I could talk.


56
00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.127
So he's "talk, talk, talk."
It's my turn next!


57
00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:39.379
And...

58
00:04:39.587 --> 00:04:41.589
[audience laughing]

59
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.966
I said, "My dad never hit us."

60
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.387
My dad is a lawyer
and he was a debate team champion.


61
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.680
So he would pick us apart
psychologically.


62
00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:54.602
One time I was at the dinner table
when I was like six, because I had to be.


63
00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.980
My dad goes, "How was school today?"

64
00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.817
I said, "It was good
but someone pushed Tyler off the seesaw."


65
00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:01.901
"And where were you?"

66
00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.361
"I was over on the bench."

67
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.862
"And what did you do?"

68
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.697
"Nothing. I was over on the bench."

69
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.491
"But you saw what happened?"

70
00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.076
"Yeah, 'cause I was over on the bench."

71
00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:12.787
"So you saw what happened
and you did nothing?"


72
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.789
"Yeah, 'cause I was sitting
over on the bench."


73
00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:18.459
"Let me ask you this. 
In Nazi Germany..."

74
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.961
[audience laughing]

75
00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.880
"...when people saw what the Nazis
were doing and did nothing,


76
00:05:22.964 --> 00:05:24.465
were those good people?"

77
00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.968
"No, those are bad people.
You gotta stop the Nazis."


78
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:31.264
"But you saw what they were doing to Tyler
and you did nothing!"


79
00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.558
"Because I was over on the bench."

80
00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:36.686
And then my dad said,
"Just explain to me this.


81
00:05:36.894 --> 00:05:38.896
How are you better than a Nazi?"

82
00:05:39.147 --> 00:05:43.776
And then my mom said,
"I made a salad with Craisins!"


83
00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.987
And the conversation ended.

84
00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:51.033
My dad's a very weird, informal guy.

85
00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.036
A lot of people ask me
if he gave me a sex talk.


86
00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:55.246
Yes.

87
00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:56.372
I think.

88
00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:02.253
I was like 12 years old and my dad
walked up to me and he said, "Hello...


89
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.255
[chuckles]

90
00:06:06.716 --> 00:06:08.759
Hello, I'm Chip Mulaney. 
I'm your father."

91
00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:12.972
And then he said the following,

92
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:15.683
"You know,  Leonard Bernstein...

93
00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:20.313
was one of the great composers
and conductors of the 20th century,


94
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.815
but sometimes he would be gay.

95
00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:26.569
And according to a biography
I read of him,


96
00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:31.491
when he was holding back the gay part,
he did some of his best work."


97
00:06:33.534 --> 00:06:36.621
[audience laughing]

98
00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:42.793
Now we don't have time
to unpack all of that.


99
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.964
And I don't know if he was
discouraging me from being gay


100
00:06:47.048 --> 00:06:49.509
or encouraging me
to be a classical composer.


101
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.013
But that is how he thought to phrase it
to a 12-year-old boy.


102
00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:55.598
How would that ever work?

103
00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:59.852
Like years later, I'd be in college
about to go down on some rocking twink


104
00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.771
and I'd be like, "Wait a second...

105
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.399
What would Leonard Bernstein do?"

106
00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:14.700
I've never talked to my dad about that,
but I figured I would tell all of you.


107
00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:16.160
[audience laughing]

108
00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:17.411
This is so great.

109
00:07:17.495 --> 00:07:20.665
Thank you for coming. You're here.
That's great. You all showed up.


110
00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:22.750
-[audience cheering]
-I appreciate it.


111
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:27.463
And then we showed up so you got to see
the things that you paid to see.


112
00:07:27.588 --> 00:07:28.506
That's great.

113
00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:31.342
You don't always get to see
the things that you paid to see.


114
00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:33.803
Ever been to the goddamn zoo?

115
00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:37.431
Those guys are never
where they're supposed to be.


116
00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:41.102
Every time I go to the zoo I'm like,
"Hey, where's the jaguar?"


117
00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:44.355
And the zoo guy is like,
"He must be in the inside part."


118
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.190
The inside part?

119
00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.067
Tell him we're here.

120
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.152
[audience laughing]

121
00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:54.949
I love doing stand-up for crowds
because this right here,


122
00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:58.160
this reminds me of assembly
in grade school.


123
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.831
And assembly was the only part of school
I ever liked.


124
00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:04.834
Once you leave school,
you don't get to have assembly.


125
00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:09.714
This is the closest we get
in adult life to assembly.


126
00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.551
'Cause look at you all,
you're just sitting there in chairs,


127
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:17.847
looking at a guy
with absolutely no expertise,


128
00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:21.017
who's going to talk for a while.

129
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:23.894
Although this is different than assembly

130
00:08:23.978 --> 00:08:26.105
because you bought tickets,
you knew this was coming.


131
00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:29.275
Assembly you never knew was coming
when you were a kid.


132
00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.444
You just showed up at 8:00 a.m.

133
00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:35.448
and they were like,
"Put down your stuff. Go to the gym."


134
00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.785
You're like, "God, I guess they're finally
going to kill us all. All right.


135
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.789
This is younger than I thought I would be
but we are pretty big assholes."


136
00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:48.085
You get to the gym and the whole school
is sitting on the floor.


137
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:50.671
You're like, "What are we,
about to graduate from Tuesday?"


138
00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.841
My principal would always come out
to kick things off.


139
00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:58.554
She'd be like, "Children, rather
than continue to teach you how to read,


140
00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:01.432
we have cleared the entire day

141
00:09:01.849 --> 00:09:04.810
for this random guy."

142
00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:07.855
[imitating New York accent]
"I used to smoke crack!


143
00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.442
As you seven and eight-year-olds
probably know,


144
00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:14.779
freebasing is the greatest orgasm
known to man.


145
00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:16.864
But I'm here to tell you there's hope.

146
00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.866
I've been sober now two weeks.

147
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:21.327
Well, weekdays, not weekends.

148
00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.455
Weekends, that's Nunzio's time."

149
00:09:25.247 --> 00:09:28.501
I was once in assembly listening to a guy
talk about smoking crack.


150
00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:32.505
My social studies teacher yelled at me,
"Sit up straight! Show some respect."


151
00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.882
I was like, "He's smoking cocaine."

152
00:09:35.716 --> 00:09:39.887
"Sit up straight"?
He's standing on a 45-degree angle.


153
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:43.474
Or, as junkies call it, first position.

154
00:09:43.557 --> 00:09:44.892
[audience laughing]

155
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:46.977
I always got yelled at at assembly.

156
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:51.732
That's right. There was always assembly
and then, like, that second assembly


157
00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:55.444
to yell at you for how you behaved
at the first assembly.


158
00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:59.990
They'd be like, "Get in here! Sit down.

159
00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:02.827
I want to talk about
what happened yesterday."


160
00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.372
You're like eight years old,
"What's yesterday?"


161
00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:13.087
"We invite a woman here
with homemade puppets


162
00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:17.383
to teach you about bullying through skits

163
00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:21.762
and you laugh at this woman?

164
00:10:22.638 --> 00:10:25.141
We noticed you had all been bullying
each other


165
00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.893
and making fun of everything constantly.

166
00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.895
So we invite a woman

167
00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:33.274
with straight gray hair, in a denim dress,

168
00:10:33.357 --> 00:10:38.404
with a wrist-cast and homemade puppets
that all have the same voice


169
00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:41.615
to teach you about bullying through skits,

170
00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:44.869
and you, ha-ha-ha, laugh it up.

171
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:48.497
What was so funny about that woman?

172
00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.999
I want to know.

173
00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:55.379
What was so funny about
when she couldn't fit the box of puppets


174
00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:57.631
back into the trunk of her Dodge Neon?

175
00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:01.594
What was so hilarious
that you all ran to the windows?


176
00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:07.558
Well, you all missed a valuable lesson
on the danger of cliques."


177
00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:08.934
"What's a clique?"

178
00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:12.146
"It's when a group of people
hang out together."


179
00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:14.148
"Oh, you mean like having friends?"

180
00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:18.694
"No, because these people make fun
of other people."


181
00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.821
"Oh, you mean like having friends?"

182
00:11:20.905 --> 00:11:22.239
[audience laughing]

183
00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:28.996
The greatest assembly of them all,
once a year, Stranger Danger.


184
00:11:29.497 --> 00:11:32.541
Yeah, the hottest ticket in town.

185
00:11:33.584 --> 00:11:35.503
The Bruno Mars of assemblies.

186
00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:40.591
You are gathered together as a school

187
00:11:40.674 --> 00:11:44.220
and you are told never to talk
to an adult that you don't know


188
00:11:44.929 --> 00:11:48.182
and you are told this
by an adult that you don't know.


189
00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:53.062
We had the same Stranger Danger speaker
every year when I was a kid,


190
00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.606
his name was Detective JJ Bittenbinder.

191
00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.484
Go ahead and laugh.
His name is ridiculous.


192
00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:00.402
That was his name.

193
00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.655
It was JJ Bittenbinder.

194
00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:04.657
He was from the Chicago Police Department.

195
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.493
He was a child homicide expert and...

196
00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.453
-[audience is silent]
-Oh, gee.


197
00:12:09.703 --> 00:12:11.121
[audience laughing]

198
00:12:12.122 --> 00:12:15.876
Very sorry, Radio City,
did that make you uncomfortable?


199
00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:20.756
Well, guess what?
You're adults and he's not even here.


200
00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:24.009
So try being seven years old

201
00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:26.262
and you're sitting
five feet away from him.


202
00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.972
He's still got blood on his shoes.

203
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:32.017
And he's looking at you
in the eye to tell you


204
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:35.813
for the first time
in your very young life


205
00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:39.942
that some adults find you
incredibly attractive.


206
00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:42.027
[audience laughing]

207
00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:47.867
And they may just have to kill you
over it.


208
00:12:48.617 --> 00:12:51.871
Okay, <i>c'est la vie,</i>
go be kids, go have fun.


209
00:12:53.455 --> 00:12:55.082
Bittenbinder came every year.

210
00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:58.544
By the way, Detective JJ Bittenbinder
wore three-piece suits.


211
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:00.588
He also wore a pocket watch.

212
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:03.090
Two years in a row,
he wore a cowboy hat.

213
00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:05.801
He also had a huge handlebar mustache.

214
00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:10.472
None of that matters, but it's important
to me that you know that.


215
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.184
He did not look like his job description.

216
00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:18.647
He looked like he should be the conductor
on a locomotive powered by confetti.


217
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:22.359
But, instead,
he made his living in murder.


218
00:13:23.527 --> 00:13:29.491
He was the weirdest goddamn person
I ever saw in my entire life.


219
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.494
He was a man most acquainted with misery.

220
00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.373
He could look at a child
and guess the price of their coffin.


221
00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:38.459
[audience laughing]

222
00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.170
That line never gets a laugh.

223
00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:44.131
But once you write it,
it stays in the act forever.


224
00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.595
So Bittenbinder came every year
with a program to teach us


225
00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:52.765
about the violent world waiting for us
outside the school gym,


226
00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.184
and that program was called Street Smarts!

227
00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:59.188
"Time for Street Smarts
with Detective JJ Bittenbinder.


228
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.565
Shut up! You're all gonna die.
Street Smarts!"


229
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.776
That was the general tone.

230
00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.528
He would give us
tips to deal with crime.

231
00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.822
I will share some of the tips
with you this evening.


232
00:14:09.198 --> 00:14:11.575
"Okay, tip number one. 
Street Smarts!

233
00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.746
Let's say a guy pulls a knife on you
to mug you."


234
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:19.667
You remember the scourge of muggings
when you were in second and third grade.


235
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.210
You know how a mugger thinks.

236
00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.253
"Man, I need cash for drugs right now.

237
00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.548
Hey, maybe that eight-year-old
with the goddamn <i>Aladdin</i>wallet


238
00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:30.010
that only has blank photo laminate pages
in it will be able to help."


239
00:14:33.013 --> 00:14:36.517
"Let's say a guy pulls a knife on you
to mug you. What do you do?


240
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.310
You go fumbling for your wallet.

241
00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:40.145
And you go fumbling for your wallet.

242
00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:43.399
Well, in that split-second,
that's when he's going to stab you.


243
00:14:44.066 --> 00:14:45.442
So here's what you do.

244
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:48.278
You kids get yourselves a money clip.

245
00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:51.448
Okay, you can get these
at any haberdashery.


246
00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:58.372
You put a $50 bill in the money clip
then when a guy flashes a blade, you go,


247
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.541
'You want my money, go get it!'

248
00:15:00.624 --> 00:15:02.418
Then you run the other direction."

249
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.170
And our teachers were like,
"Write that down."


250
00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:06.922
[audience laughing]

251
00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:11.218
We're like, "Buy a money clip.
Engraved, question mark?"


252
00:15:12.219 --> 00:15:13.512
You go home to your parents.

253
00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:17.975
"Hey, Dad. Can I have a silver money clip
with a $50 bill in it, please?


254
00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:19.101
Don't worry.

255
00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.103
I'm only going to
chuck it into the gutter

256
00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.397
and run away at
the first sign of trouble.

257
00:15:23.731 --> 00:15:26.859
The man with the mustache
told me to do it."


258
00:15:28.736 --> 00:15:30.529
"Tip number two. 
Street Smarts!

259
00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:35.993
Let's say a kidnapper throws you
in the back of a trunk..."


260
00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:38.454
This was at nine in the morning.

261
00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.872
[audience laughing]

262
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:45.711
"Let's say a kidnapper throws you

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:47.421
Don't panic.

00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:48.922
[chuckles]

265
00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:52.926
Once you get your bearings...

266
00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.765
find the carpet
that covers the taillight,


267
00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:01.018
peel back the carpet, make a fist,

268
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:04.271
punch the taillight
out the back of the car,


269
00:16:04.438 --> 00:16:07.608
thus creating a hole
in the back of the automobile,


270
00:16:08.108 --> 00:16:14.073
then stick your little hand out
and wave to oncoming motorists


271
00:16:14.323 --> 00:16:17.826
to let them know
that something hinky is going on."


272
00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:20.788
Can you imagine driving behind that?

273
00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:25.209
[imitating a thud]

274
00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.547
I think they're turning left.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.678
"Tip number three. 
Street Smarts!

277
00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:40.682
You kids have no upper body strength."

278
00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:43.018
And we were like, "We know but, hey."

279
00:16:44.311 --> 00:16:47.689
"If some guy tries to grab you,
you can't fight him with fists.


280
00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:49.149
So here's what you do.

281
00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:53.195
You kids fall down on your back
and you kick upward at him.


282
00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:55.614
That'll throw him off his rhythm."

283
00:16:56.031 --> 00:17:00.327
That was a big thing with Bittenbinder,
throwing pedophiles off their rhythm.


284
00:17:01.203 --> 00:17:05.290
"He's not gonna know how to fight back
with two little sneakers coming at him."

he'd still be alive today. 
Street Smarts!"

288
00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:18.178
Yeah, he was not a "spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down" kind of guy.


289
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:22.975
He was more like, "Brush your teeth.
Now, boom, orange juice. That's life."


290
00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:30.107
Bittenbinder, he didn't want us
to not get kidnapped.


291
00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:33.569
He wanted us to almost get kidnapped

292
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:39.283
and then fight the guy off using weird,
psych-out, back-room Chicago violence.


293
00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:42.077
Like here's what he wanted
to see on the news.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.621
"We're here with seven-year-old
John Mulaney

who fended off a kidnapper earlier today.
How did you do it, John?"

[imitating heavy Chicago accent]
"Well, thank ya for askin'.

00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:53.005
I used the Bittenbinder method.

00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:55.841
When I saw the perp approachin',

299
00:17:55.924 --> 00:17:59.678
I chewed up a tab of Alka-Seltzer
I carry with me at all times.


300
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:02.764
This created
a foaming-at-the-mouth appearance


301
00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.892
that made it look like I had rabies.

302
00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:07.561
Now I've thrown him off his rhythm.

303
00:18:08.729 --> 00:18:12.441
Then I reach into his jacket pocket
where I had planted a gram of coke


304
00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:15.319
and I went, 'Whoa! 
What the fuck is this?'

305
00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:20.699
And he goes, 'That's not mine.
I never seen that before.'


306
00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:22.743
I go, 'Boo-hoo, it's in your jacket.

307
00:18:22.826 --> 00:18:26.121
You're doing two to ten and your kids
are going into Social Services.'


308
00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.081
Now he's cryin'!

309
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.295
Then I grab a telephone book
and I beat him on the torso with it.


310
00:18:33.962 --> 00:18:39.051
'Cause as any Chicago cop will tell ya,
a phone book doesn't leave bruises."


311
00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:43.096
"Well, that was
seven-year-old John Mulaney,


312
00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:46.808
currently being sued
for police brutality."


313
00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.268
[audience laughing]

314
00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:52.689
Bittenbinder told me things
that haunt me to this day.


315
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:54.983
He came one year for assembly.

316
00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.861
He goes, "Okay, when you get kidnapped..."
Not if, when.


317
00:18:57.986 --> 00:18:59.738
[audience laughing]

318
00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:03.700
"Okay, so when you get kidnapped,
the place where the guy grabs ya,


319
00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:06.662
in the biz we call that
the primary location.


320
00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:11.124
Okay. Your odds of coming back alive
from the primary location, about 60%.


321
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:14.586
But if you are taken
to a secondary location,


322
00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:18.215
your odds of coming back alive
are slim to none."


323
00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:26.014
I am 35 years old and I am still terrified
of secondary locations.


324
00:19:26.723 --> 00:19:31.979
If I'm at a place,
I never want to go to another place.


325
00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:34.898
I'll be at a wedding reception
and someone'll be like,


326
00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:36.441
"You coming to the hotel bar after?

327
00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:38.777
We're all gonna get drinks
and keep the party going."


328
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.198
I'm like, "Nah, sister. You're not
getting me to no secondary location.


329
00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.075
You want it? Go get it!"

330
00:19:50.247 --> 00:19:52.666
Street Smarts! 
Stay alert out there.

331
00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:58.005
I thought I was going to be murdered
my entire childhood.


332
00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:02.301
In high school people were like,
"What are your top three colleges?"


333
00:20:02.384 --> 00:20:05.595
I was like, "Top three colleges?
I thought I would be dead in a trunk


334
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.806
with my hand hanging out
of the taillight by now."


335
00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:12.019
I went to college. For the whole time.

336
00:20:13.228 --> 00:20:14.396
Holy shit, right?

337
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.567
I just got a letter from my college,
which was fun 'cause mail, you know?


338
00:20:20.235 --> 00:20:24.448
So I open up the letter and they said,
"Hey, John, it's college. You remember?"


339
00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.409
I say, "Yes, of course."

340
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.872
And they said... How did they phrase it?
They said, "Give us some money!"


341
00:20:31.955 --> 00:20:33.290
[audience laughing]

342
00:20:33.623 --> 00:20:34.624
"As a gift!

343
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.752
We want a gift!

344
00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:39.713
But only if it's money."

345
00:20:42.215 --> 00:20:43.550
I found this peculiar.

346
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:48.221
You see, what had happened, New York,
was that when I was a student,


347
00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:50.182
I had paid them tuition money.

348
00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:54.644
Every semester, two semesters a year,
for four years.


349
00:20:54.728 --> 00:20:59.483
I don't remember exactly what it was,
but rounding up, back in 1999 dollars,


350
00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:02.652
it was about $15,000 a semester,

351
00:21:02.944 --> 00:21:05.655
two semesters a year, for four years.

352
00:21:05.739 --> 00:21:08.909
So it was about $30,000 a year
for four years.


353
00:21:09.326 --> 00:21:12.746
So it was about $120,000, okay?

354
00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:18.293
So roughly speaking,
I gave my college about $120,000.


355
00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:24.383
Okay, so you might say
that I already gave them $120,000


356
00:21:24.466 --> 00:21:29.638
and now you have the audacity
to ask me for more money.


357
00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:31.973
What kind of a cokehead relative...

358
00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:33.433
[audience cheering]

359
00:21:34.434 --> 00:21:38.271
What kind of a cokehead relative
is my college?


360
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.357
You spent it already?

361
00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:44.694
I gave you more money
than the Civil War cost


362
00:21:44.945 --> 00:21:47.697
and you fucking spent it already?

363
00:21:48.782 --> 00:21:52.369
Where's my money? I felt like
Jimmy Stewart in <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>


364
00:21:52.452 --> 00:21:54.162
when he's screaming at his uncle Billy.

365
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.374
[as Jimmy Stewart] "Where's the money?
Where's that money, you fat motherfucker?


366
00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:02.671
Where's my money? Stay down on the ground,
you motherfucker!"


367
00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:04.297
That's not the dialogue.

368
00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:06.716
But do you remember that scene
from <i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>


369
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.094
Great movie, Frank Capra, 1946.

370
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:12.889
A hundred and twenty thousand dollars!

371
00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:14.891
I have friends I went to college with

372
00:22:15.016 --> 00:22:18.145
and they're like, "You should donate
and be a good alumnus."


373
00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:21.606
And they wear shirts that say "school"
and it's like, look...


374
00:22:22.023 --> 00:22:24.484
if you're an adult still giving money
to your college,


375
00:22:24.818 --> 00:22:28.029
college is a $120,000 hooker

376
00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:30.615
and you are an idiot
who fell in love with her.


377
00:22:31.032 --> 00:22:34.035
She's not going to do
anything else for you.


378
00:22:34.411 --> 00:22:35.829
It's done.

379
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.250
In their letter they were like,

380
00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:43.003
"Hey, it's been a while
since you've given us money."


381
00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:46.715
I was like, "Hey, it's been a while
since you've housed and taught me.


382
00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:50.093
I thought our transaction was over.

383
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.222
I gave you $120,000

384
00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:59.978
and you gave me a weird cinder block room
with a <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> poster on it


385
00:23:00.687 --> 00:23:05.108
and the first real heartbreak of my life,
and probably HPV,


386
00:23:05.192 --> 00:23:07.235
and then we called it a day."

387
00:23:07.944 --> 00:23:09.196
Probably.

388
00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:10.780
[audience laughing]

389
00:23:11.114 --> 00:23:12.824
Also, what did I get for my money?

390
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.201
What is college?

391
00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:16.161
[babbles]

393
00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:20.957
Stop going until we figure it out.

394
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.960
Because I went to college,
I have no idea what it was.


395
00:23:24.252 --> 00:23:28.256
I went to college, I was 18 years old,
I looked like I was 11.


396
00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:33.303
I lived like a goddamn Ninja Turtle.

397
00:23:38.892 --> 00:23:43.188
I didn't drink water the entire time.

398
00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:47.776
I lived on cigarettes
and alcohol and Adderall.


399
00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:50.612
College was like a four-year game show

400
00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:54.449
called<i>Do My Friends Hate Me</i>
<i>or Do I Just Need to Go to Sleep?</i>


401
00:23:54.783 --> 00:24:01.414
But instead of winning money,
you lose $120,000.


402
00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:08.213
By the way, I agreed to give them
$120,000 when I was 17 years old.


403
00:24:08.296 --> 00:24:10.590
With no attorney present.

404
00:24:11.341 --> 00:24:12.884
That's illegal.

405
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:18.807
They tricked me. They tricked me like
Brendan Dassey on <i>Making a Murderer.</i>


406
00:24:18.974 --> 00:24:21.309
They tricked me like poor Brendan.

407
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:24.980
They pulled me out of high school.
I was in sweatpants, all confused.


408
00:24:26.022 --> 00:24:27.857
Two guys in clip-on ties are like,

409
00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:32.195
"Come on, son, do the right thing.
Sign here and be an English major."


410
00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:34.406
And I was like, "Okay."

411
00:24:36.449 --> 00:24:39.828
Yes, you heard me, an English major.

412
00:24:39.953 --> 00:24:44.416
-I paid $120,000.
-[audience cheering]

How dare you clap?

414
00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:48.461
How dare you clap for
the worst financial decision


415
00:24:48.545 --> 00:24:49.838
I ever made in my life?

416
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:55.802
I paid $120,000 for someone
to tell me to go read Jane Austen


417
00:24:56.052 --> 00:24:57.554
and then I didn't.

418
00:24:57.887 --> 00:24:59.514
[audience laughing]

419
00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:04.936
That's the worst use of 120 grand
I can possibly fathom.


420
00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:08.898
Other than if you, like, bought
a duffel bag of fake cocaine.


421
00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:11.359
No, I take it back.

422
00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.069
That's a better use of the money,

423
00:25:13.737 --> 00:25:16.615
'cause I know you'd be disappointed
when you open up the duffel bag


424
00:25:16.698 --> 00:25:18.450
and you realize it's not real cocaine,

425
00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:21.077
it's like powdered baby aspirin
or whatever they do.


426
00:25:21.578 --> 00:25:23.788
But at least you have baby aspirin.

427
00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:27.792
And maybe you have a baby
and one day your baby goes,


428
00:25:27.917 --> 00:25:29.628
"Oh, my head," and you go,

429
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:32.839
"Hey, I've got something for you!
Come here, little guy."


430
00:25:32.922 --> 00:25:36.468
And you dump it out on a mirror.
You make it nice for the baby.


431
00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:40.764
You make it nice. You cut it up into lines
with your laundry card or whatever


432
00:25:40.847 --> 00:25:44.517
and you make it nice,
and your baby takes his sippy-cup straw


433
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:47.395
and he holds it
in his little ravioli-sized baby fist


434
00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.980
and he leans over--
[snorts]


435
00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:50.899
and he snorts up the baby aspirin,

436
00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:54.944
and he gets rid of his baby headache,
plus you<i></i>get a duffel bag!

That is way better than walking across
a stage at graduation, hungover,


439
00:26:02.077 --> 00:26:08.041
in a gown, to accept a certificate
for reading books that I didn't read.

the sun in my eyes,

00:26:13.588 --> 00:26:17.342
my family watching
as I sweat vodka and ecstasy,


443
00:26:17.801 --> 00:26:23.765
to receive a four-year degree
in a language that I already spoke.

It's good to give to charities, you know.

448
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.531
My wife and I just gave
a bunch of stuff to Goodwill.


449
00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:42.325
We were moving apartments,
we had a bunch of clothes and furniture,


450
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:43.785
so we made a
whole day out of it.

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:47.330
We made these big piles of clothes,
we put the piles into these big boxes,


452
00:26:47.414 --> 00:26:49.499
then we put the boxes
into the back of my car,


453
00:26:49.582 --> 00:26:51.584
and then they stayed there
for four months.


454
00:26:52.502 --> 00:26:56.005
And then one day my wife said, "Hey,
you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?"


455
00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:58.800
And I said, "Of course I did!
On an unrelated note,


456
00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.469
I'm going to walk out the front door
right now."


457
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.639
So then I had to speed to Goodwill
really fast.


458
00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.891
It was charitable,
but it was also fast and violent,


459
00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:08.810
because I was throwing boxes at people.

460
00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:11.938
The boxes were so heavy
I couldn't even say what was in them.


461
00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:15.650
I was like, "This one's shirts.
I got a bunch of shirts! Take 'em away!"


462
00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:18.862
The guy tried to
give me a big receipt.

463
00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:22.115
He's like, "Take this receipt
for the clothing for your taxes."


464
00:27:22.198 --> 00:27:24.200
How do I write that on my taxes?

465
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.829
"Dear IRS, please deduct
from my federal income tax


466
00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:32.584
one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth.
It was too big.


467
00:27:32.709 --> 00:27:37.672
My mom said it could be a sleep shirt.
Please deduct this from my 2017 income."


468
00:27:38.381 --> 00:27:40.717
That sleep shirt bullshit.

469
00:27:41.301 --> 00:27:44.888
"Well, if it's too big
you can just wear it as a sleep shirt."


470
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.098
No, I get that, Mom,

471
00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:51.603
but why don't we just tell our relatives
that I'm a four-year-old boy


472
00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:56.024
and I don't wear a man's XXL T-shirt?

473
00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:59.319
"Because we don't say that
when someone gives us a gift


474
00:27:59.402 --> 00:28:01.237
because that would not be polite."

475
00:28:01.654 --> 00:28:02.572
Oh, I get it.

476
00:28:02.864 --> 00:28:06.576
So rather than violate
these meaningless politeness rules,


477
00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:12.707
I'll just go to bed in a smock
like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge.


478
00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:16.711
Why don't you give me a candle
for looking in the mirror


479
00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.713
and a floppy hat

480
00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:24.969
and I'll tremble off to bed
in my long Victorian nightgown?


481
00:28:25.595 --> 00:28:28.515
Was there ever even a ghost, Mother,

482
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:34.229
or was the dead Victorian girl you saw
just me all along?


483
00:28:35.271 --> 00:28:38.483
[audience cheering]

484
00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:43.738
So that's why you can't give to charity.

485
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:45.865
I'm kidding.

486
00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:48.660
I like to throw an "I'm kidding"
at the ends of jokes now,


487
00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:50.954
in case the jokes
are ever played in court.


488
00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:55.708
You ever heard a joke played in court?
Never goes well.


489
00:28:56.793 --> 00:29:00.380
They're like, "'And that's why
you shouldn't give... to charity.'


490
00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:05.009
Is that something you find funny,
Mr. Mulaney?"


491
00:29:06.469 --> 00:29:08.471
Um... at the time.

492
00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:10.223
[chuckles]

493
00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:13.309
I found out recently
that jokes don't do well in court.


494
00:29:13.726 --> 00:29:17.689
So, some friends of mine
were sued in college for property damage.


495
00:29:17.772 --> 00:29:22.402
And they were guilty. And the lawsuit
dragged on for years and years


496
00:29:22.569 --> 00:29:25.321
and eventually I got a call
when I was 28 years old.


497
00:29:25.405 --> 00:29:26.990
It was my friend from college,
he said,


498
00:29:27.073 --> 00:29:29.742
"Hey, that lawsuit with my neighbor
is still dragging on


499
00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:33.788
and my neighbor just subpoenaed
all my emails from college


500
00:29:33.997 --> 00:29:36.207
that mention him or the lawsuit."

501
00:29:36.457 --> 00:29:38.960
And I said, "That's crazy.
But why are you calling me?"


502
00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:41.838
And he said,
"Because you should be concerned."


503
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.047
[audience laughing]

504
00:29:43.131 --> 00:29:46.593
He said, "I have an email here
from junior year where I wrote,


505
00:29:46.676 --> 00:29:49.137
'Hey, guys, I'm going
to miss practice tonight


506
00:29:49.262 --> 00:29:52.682
because I have to meet with my neighbor
about that lawsuit thing.'


507
00:29:52.765 --> 00:29:57.770
And you replied, 'Hey, do you want me
to kill that guy for you?


508
00:30:00.773 --> 00:30:06.362
Because it sounds like he sucks
and I will totally kill that guy for you.


509
00:30:06.988 --> 00:30:10.033
Okay. See you at improv practice.'"

[audience laughing]

511
00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.661
Of all the sentences in that email

512
00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:16.623
I would be ashamed to have read out loud
in a court of law,


513
00:30:16.706 --> 00:30:20.668
I think the top one is
"See you at improv practice."


514
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.173
Strange, the passage of time.

515
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.719
I'm not that old. 
I'm 35, that is not old.

516
00:30:29.802 --> 00:30:33.973
But I am in a new phase
right before old called "gross."

[audience laughing]

518
00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:38.519
I never knew about this,
but I am now gross.


519
00:30:39.228 --> 00:30:41.981
I am damp all the time.

520
00:30:42.398 --> 00:30:44.150
I am damp now

521
00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:46.319
and I will be damp later.

522
00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:47.403
[chuckles]

523
00:30:47.528 --> 00:30:49.572
Like the back of a dolphin, my back.

524
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:52.367
I am slick.

525
00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:57.580
The butt part of my pants
is a little damp a lot


526
00:30:57.664 --> 00:31:01.542
and I don't think it's anything serious...
but isn't it, though?


527
00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:02.543
And...

528
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:05.254
I'll be sitting at a restaurant
and I'll get up and I'll be like,


529
00:31:05.338 --> 00:31:08.091
"What did I sit in?"
And it was me.


530
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:11.344
I'm gross now.

531
00:31:11.427 --> 00:31:13.763
I've been talking through burps.

532
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:16.766
I never used to do this.

533
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.144
When I was a kid and I wanted to burp,
I'd be like, "Silence!"


534
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.689
Blagh!

535
00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:27.276
Now I'm trying to push 'em down
and muscle through 'em.


536
00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:30.863
I'll be at dinner,
just doing the bread and the seltzer,


537
00:31:30.947 --> 00:31:32.615
filling up like a hot air balloon,

538
00:31:33.408 --> 00:31:34.409
and then I'm like...

539
00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.911
[belches]
"Did you say you were going to Italy?


540
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.164
Because we have a travel--
She has a travel agent if--

[exhales]

542
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.335
I'm going to the kitchen,
does anyone need anything?


543
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:45.878
From the... [belches]

Anyone need anything?"

00:31:46.963 --> 00:31:48.840
Just take a pause, John!

546
00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:51.676
I'm gross.

547
00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:53.428
I have hair on my shoulders now.

548
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.263
I don't even have a joke for that.

549
00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:57.098
That's how much I hate that shit.

550
00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:58.850
[audience laughing]

551
00:31:59.225 --> 00:32:01.561
I was sitting up in bed a few weeks ago
like...


552
00:32:01.644 --> 00:32:03.604
[groans]
You know, life.


553
00:32:03.771 --> 00:32:08.526
And my wife was rubbing my shoulders,
which was very nice of her,


554
00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:11.070
but then she started
singing to herself.


555
00:32:12.613 --> 00:32:14.657
"Monkey, monkey, monkey man."

556
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:16.743
[audience laughing]

557
00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:20.163
"Monkey, monkey, monkey man."

558
00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:22.790
Not at me.

559
00:32:24.751 --> 00:32:25.710
Not to be mean.

560
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.213
This was a song
from deep in her subconscious.


561
00:32:30.506 --> 00:32:33.259
I don't even think she was aware
she was singing it.


562
00:32:34.177 --> 00:32:36.804
But it was certainly not the first time
she had sung it.


563
00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:40.683
I don't know what my body is for

564
00:32:41.434 --> 00:32:43.853
other than just taking my head
from room to room.


565
00:32:43.936 --> 00:32:45.938
[audience laughing]

566
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.690
And it's not getting any better.

567
00:32:47.774 --> 00:32:51.527
I'm 35, but I'm still like, "Hey,
when am I going to get big and strong?"


568
00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:54.363
This is it.

569
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.282
It's just going to be this.

570
00:32:56.699 --> 00:33:00.286
I'm like an iPhone, it's going to be
worse versions of this every year,


571
00:33:00.661 --> 00:33:04.207
plus I get super hot in the middle
of the afternoon for no reason.


572
00:33:07.502 --> 00:33:09.754
As I get older,
it's tough to not get grumpy.


573
00:33:09.837 --> 00:33:10.713
It's tempting.

574
00:33:11.172 --> 00:33:12.590
I get grumpy about some things.

575
00:33:12.673 --> 00:33:14.801
Like, I can't listen to any new songs

576
00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:18.805
because every new song is about
how tonight is the night


577
00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:21.557
and how we only have tonight.

578
00:33:22.725 --> 00:33:25.853
That is such 19-year-old horseshit.

579
00:33:26.646 --> 00:33:28.481
I want to write songs
for people in their 30s


580
00:33:28.564 --> 00:33:31.400
called "Tonight's No Good,
How About Wednesday?


581
00:33:32.902 --> 00:33:35.905
Oh, You're in Dallas on Wednesday? Okay.

582
00:33:35.988 --> 00:33:38.449
Well, Let's Just Not See Each Other
for Eight Months

00:33:38.574 --> 00:33:41.452
And It Doesn't Matter at All."

[audience cheering]

585
00:33:48.042 --> 00:33:51.087
I'm trying to stay nice though,
because when I was a kid,


586
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.841
I was raised that you should be nice
to everyone in every situation


587
00:33:54.924 --> 00:33:56.467
because you never know their story.

588
00:33:57.093 --> 00:33:58.928
But now, at the end of my life,

589
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.140
I don't know,

590
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.101
because a lot of people
don't seem that nice


591
00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:07.103
and they seem to be doing fine
in the world.


592
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:10.189
Or maybe they have different definitions
of what it means to be nice.


593
00:34:10.273 --> 00:34:12.984
That's something you figure out
as you get older and meet new people.


594
00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.111
Not everyone thinks
the same things are nice.


595
00:34:15.361 --> 00:34:17.363
You learn that especially
when you get jobs.


596
00:34:17.697 --> 00:34:21.534
I had a very weird job in my mid-20s
for about four and a half years.


597
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:24.829
I was a writer right across the street
over at <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>


598
00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:27.415
-It was very exciting. Yeah.

you gotta check it out.


601
00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:35.798
They have a host and a musical guest.
Oh, my God, you're going to love it.


602
00:34:36.382 --> 00:34:37.633
Real quick tangent.

603
00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:41.637
Okay, my favorite host ever
introducing a musical guest was this.


604
00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:46.058
The host was Sir Patrick Stewart,
the great Sir Patrick Stewart,


605
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.061
and this is how he introduced
the musical guest.


606
00:34:49.312 --> 00:34:52.690
"Ladies and gentlemen,
Salt-N-Pepa!"


607
00:34:52.773 --> 00:34:54.275
[audience laughing]

608
00:34:54.442 --> 00:34:56.694
Like he was surprised by Pepa.

609
00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.155
Like minutes before they'd been,

610
00:34:59.238 --> 00:35:01.741
"Sir Patrick, we can't find
Pepa anywhere."


611
00:35:01.824 --> 00:35:04.452
And he's like,
"If we must go on with Salt alone,


612
00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:07.622
we will go on with Salt alone!"

613
00:35:08.247 --> 00:35:12.001
And they were like, "Three, two, one,"
and Pepa burst through the door


614
00:35:12.084 --> 00:35:14.879
and he's like, "Ladies and gentlemen,
Salt and... what's this?


615
00:35:16.797 --> 00:35:18.341
Pepa!"

616
00:35:22.136 --> 00:35:24.513
Famous people are weird as shit.

617
00:35:25.932 --> 00:35:27.141
They're all weird.

618
00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:28.976
Your suspicions are correct.

619
00:35:29.644 --> 00:35:31.812
And they would all come in
to <i>Saturday Night Live</i>


620
00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:34.398
and they'd have to meet with me
because I was a little rat writer


621
00:35:34.482 --> 00:35:36.234
and they'd have to talk
about the sketches.


622
00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:39.028
They'd sit on my office couch
that had like bed bugs and stuff.


623
00:35:39.528 --> 00:35:40.363
It was great.

624
00:35:40.446 --> 00:35:42.448
Like, they were famous,
but it was my couch.


625
00:35:42.531 --> 00:35:44.575
It'd be like if you went into
your childhood bedroom


626
00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:46.118
and Joe DiMaggio was sitting there.

627
00:35:46.327 --> 00:35:49.997
Yeah, he's Joe DiMaggio, he's a legend,
he had sex with Marilyn Monroe,


628
00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.166
but only <i>you</i>know where the bathroom is.

629
00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.918
[audience laughing]

630
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.879
Everyone always wants to know
if famous people are nice.


631
00:35:56.963 --> 00:35:58.005
Like Mick Jagger.

632
00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.507
He came in to host the show.

633
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.801
My friends were all like, "Is he nice?"

634
00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.177
No!

635
00:36:04.053 --> 00:36:05.596
Or maybe he is...

636
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.223
for his version of life.

637
00:36:07.473 --> 00:36:09.475
Because he has a very different life.

638
00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:11.060
He's Mick Jagger.

639
00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:13.145
That's his name.

640
00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:19.527
He's played to stadiums of 20,000 people
cheering for him like he's a god


641
00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.112
for 50 years.

642
00:36:21.404 --> 00:36:23.864
That must change you as a person.

643
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.867
If you do that for 50 years,
you're never again going to be like,


644
00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.537
"Um, does anyone have
a laptop charger I could borrow?"


645
00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:33.958
None of that bullshit way
we all have to talk to get through life.


646
00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:36.168
[in plaintive voice]
"Hi. Knock, knock. Sorry."


647
00:36:36.252 --> 00:36:37.920
That's how I walk into rooms.

648
00:36:38.254 --> 00:36:41.632
I am 35 years old, 
I am six feet tall.

649
00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:44.260
I lower myself, I go,
"Hi. Knock, knock."


650
00:36:44.343 --> 00:36:47.096
I say "knock, knock" out loud.

651
00:36:48.431 --> 00:36:51.892
Mick Jagger didn't talk like that.
Mick Jagger talked like this.


652
00:36:52.018 --> 00:36:57.398
He'd go, "Yes! No! Yes!"

653
00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:02.028
I pitched him a joke and he went,
"Not funny!"


654
00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:04.113
[audience laughing]

655
00:37:05.406 --> 00:37:08.909
I mean, people say that on the internet,
but never to your face


656
00:37:09.201 --> 00:37:14.623
does a British billionaire
in leather pants go, "Not funny!"


657
00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.295
I spent two hours alone with Mick Jagger
that week.


658
00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:22.715
We were writing song lyrics, it was for
a fake song in a comedy sketch.


659
00:37:22.798 --> 00:37:25.259
And he was sitting there,
and we came to one point and he goes,


660
00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:29.638
"All right, 'Let's all go to the picnic,
let's all have a drink.'


661
00:37:30.264 --> 00:37:32.516
Let's see, what rhymes with drink?"

662
00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:34.018
And I said...

663
00:37:34.643 --> 00:37:35.478
"Think?"

664
00:37:36.228 --> 00:37:37.480
And Mick Jagger said,

665
00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.482
"No!"

666
00:37:39.565 --> 00:37:41.567
[audience laughing]

667
00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:45.946
And then I said,

668
00:37:47.073 --> 00:37:47.907
"Sink?"

669
00:37:49.116 --> 00:37:50.659
And Mick Jagger said...

670
00:37:51.786 --> 00:37:52.620
"Yeah!"

671
00:37:53.079 --> 00:37:57.333
And I was like, "Motherfucker,
is this how you write songs?


672
00:37:58.417 --> 00:38:01.754
Just one word at a time
with verbal abuse?"


673
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:04.924
"All right, 'I can't get no...'"

674
00:38:05.007 --> 00:38:07.051
-Happiness?
-"No!"


675
00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:09.637
-Satisfaction?
-"Yeah!


676
00:38:10.012 --> 00:38:12.431
All right! Next sentence!

677
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:17.144
Space bar. Indent. Space bar."

678
00:38:18.687 --> 00:38:20.940
Mick Jagger would go like this,
"Diet Coke!"


679
00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.775
And one would appear in his hand.

680
00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:25.027
Now that's not nice, right?

681
00:38:25.444 --> 00:38:27.405
The way I was raised,
you're supposed to say,


682
00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:31.033
"May I please have a Diet Coke, please?"
And then maybe you will get one.


683
00:38:31.826 --> 00:38:34.328
And I bet all of you were taught
to say please and thank you.


684
00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:37.706
But if all of us could go, "Diet Coke!"
and one would appear in our hand,


685
00:38:37.832 --> 00:38:40.209
we'd do it all day long.

686
00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:43.337
Even if you don't like Diet Coke,
you'd just summon 'em


687
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.714
so you could chuck 'em at oncoming cars.

688
00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:49.176
Famous people are often rude

689
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.637
because they're used to getting things
really quickly.


690
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.431
I bet a lot
of us are pretty polite.

691
00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:56.934
But as soon as we get things quickly,
we start to get ruder and ruder.


692
00:38:57.476 --> 00:39:00.604
Look at technology, it's faster than ever
and we're ruder than ever.


693
00:39:00.855 --> 00:39:04.775
People walk around on the phone now,
"Hello? You still there? Lost him."


694
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:08.112
And that's it.
No follow-through with that guy.


695
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:12.199
Fifty years ago, if you were on
the telephone with your friend


696
00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:16.912
and suddenly the line just went dead,
that meant your friend was murdered.


697
00:39:18.747 --> 00:39:20.916
The phone used to be a big deal.

698
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.877
It was a long, polite process.

699
00:39:23.252 --> 00:39:26.547
Back in the 1940s,
the phone was like a wood box...


700
00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:28.257
with a thing on it. I don't know.

701
00:39:30.843 --> 00:39:33.387
It had its own room. You'd go,
"That's the phone's room!"


702
00:39:35.055 --> 00:39:37.516
And it was expensive.
You'd wait all week to make your call.


703
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.726
"It's almost Tuesday!"

704
00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:42.438
And then you'd take the cup on the string
or whatever...


705
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.484
There weren't even numbers.
You'd just go, "Hello? Anyone?


706
00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:48.652
[yells]
Anyone in the world?"


707
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.075
Then you'd go,
"Operator, ring me Neptune 5-117."


708
00:39:55.242 --> 00:39:58.412
And the operator was a real person
that you had to be nice to.


709
00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.664
She'd be like, "One moment, please.

710
00:40:00.748 --> 00:40:04.585
I'm putting wires
into a board filled with holes


711
00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:08.923
to move the voices around,
'cause it is the '40s."


712
00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:11.926
And it took like 90 minutes.

713
00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:15.513
Now people just drive around
screaming at their phones like...


714
00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:18.807
-Call home!
-"Calling the mobile for Tom."


715
00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:20.643
Not fucking Tom!

716
00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.354
[imitating Mick Jagger]
Not funny!


717
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:25.773
[audience laughing]

718
00:40:27.316 --> 00:40:30.819
Everything was slower back in the old days
'cause they didn't have enough to do,


719
00:40:30.903 --> 00:40:33.239
so they had to slow things down
to fill the time.


720
00:40:33.906 --> 00:40:35.449
I don't know if you read history,

721
00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:39.787
but back then people would wake up and go,
"God, it's the old times."


722
00:40:40.162 --> 00:40:42.164
[audience laughing]

723
00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:44.208
"Shit, I gotta wear all those layers.

724
00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:48.003
There's no Zyrtec or nothing.
Okay, we gotta...


725
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:53.592
We gotta think of some
weird slow activities to fill the day."


726
00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.010
And they did.

727
00:40:55.886 --> 00:41:02.851
Have you ever seen old film from the past
of people just waving at a ship?


728
00:41:04.144 --> 00:41:06.647
[audience laughing]

729
00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:10.818
What if I called
you now to do that?

730
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:13.279
Hey, what are you doing
Monday at 10:00 a.m.?


731
00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:16.532
All right, there's a Norwegian Cruise Line
leaving for Martinique.


732
00:41:16.615 --> 00:41:20.911
Here's my plan, you and me get
very dressed up, including hats,


733
00:41:20.995 --> 00:41:25.291
and then we wave handkerchiefs at it
until it disappears over the horizon.


734
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:28.127
No, I don't know anyone on the ship.

735
00:41:28.377 --> 00:41:30.379
[audience laughing]

736
00:41:30.963 --> 00:41:34.008
Everything is too fast now
and totally unreasonable.


737
00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:37.803
The world is run by computers,
the world is run by robots


738
00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:41.932
and we spend most of our day telling them
that we're not a robot


739
00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:45.060
just to log on and
look at our own stuff.

740
00:41:46.812 --> 00:41:47.896
All day long.

741
00:41:48.397 --> 00:41:50.316
May I see my stuff, please?

742
00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:52.735
[grumbles]

743
00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:55.779
"I smell a robot.

744
00:41:57.156 --> 00:41:59.491
Prove, prove, prove.

745
00:42:00.659 --> 00:42:03.162
Prove to me you're not a robot.

746
00:42:04.163 --> 00:42:07.124
Look at these curvy letters.

747
00:42:08.042 --> 00:42:11.211
Much curvier than most letters,
wouldn't you say?


748
00:42:11.837 --> 00:42:14.006
No robot could ever read these.

749
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.592
You look, mortal, if ye be.

750
00:42:16.717 --> 00:42:20.763
You look and then you type
what you think you see.


751
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.100
Is it an "E" or is it a "3"?

752
00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:28.103
That's up to ye.

753
00:42:29.063 --> 00:42:31.899
The passwords of past
you've correctly guessed,


754
00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:34.610
but now it's time for the robot test!

755
00:42:35.778 --> 00:42:40.074
I've devised a question
no robot could ever answer.


756
00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:44.078
Which of these pictures does not have
a stop sign in it?"


757
00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.537
Fucking what?

758
00:42:45.621 --> 00:42:48.332
[audience cheering]

759
00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:54.546
You spend most of your day telling a robot
that you're not a robot.


760
00:42:54.755 --> 00:42:56.173
Think about that for two minutes

761
00:42:56.256 --> 00:42:58.634
and tell me you don't want
to walk into the ocean.


762
00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.222
I just like old-fashioned things.

763
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:06.308
I was in Connecticut recently,
doing white people stuff.


764
00:43:06.392 --> 00:43:07.685
[audience cheering]

765
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:08.894
Yeah.

766
00:43:09.812 --> 00:43:10.646
One day...

767
00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:14.775
Well, it doesn't matter why,
but I was sitting in a gazebo, and...


768
00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.235
[audience laughing]

769
00:43:16.735 --> 00:43:18.570
there was a plaque on the gazebo

770
00:43:18.904 --> 00:43:24.034
and it said, "This gazebo was built
by the town in 1863."


771
00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:27.579
That is in the
middle of the Civil War.

772
00:43:28.831 --> 00:43:32.084
And the whole town built a gazebo.

773
00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.003
What was that town meeting like?

774
00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.464
"All right, everyone,
first order of business,


775
00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:40.342
we have all the telegrams from Gettysburg
with the war dead.


776
00:43:40.426 --> 00:43:41.260
Let's see here.

777
00:43:41.343 --> 00:43:44.054
Okay, everyone's husband
and brother and... everyone died.


778
00:43:44.138 --> 00:43:46.473
Okay. Josiah, you had something?"

779
00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:47.725
"Yes, I do.

780
00:43:48.267 --> 00:43:51.270
How'd you like to be indoors
and out of doors all at once?


781
00:43:52.271 --> 00:43:55.190
Ever walk into the park with
your betrothed and it starts to rain,


782
00:43:55.274 --> 00:43:56.734
but you still want to hold hands?

783
00:43:56.817 --> 00:44:00.028
Well, may I introduce you to,
and my condolences again to everyone,


784
00:44:00.112 --> 00:44:01.739
the gazebo!"

785
00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:03.073
[audience laughing]

786
00:44:03.615 --> 00:44:06.285
Building a gazebo during the Civil War,

787
00:44:06.535 --> 00:44:09.121
that'd be like doing stand-up comedy now.

788
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.333
[audience laughing and applauding]

789
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:15.377
Yes.

790
00:44:19.006 --> 00:44:22.176
Thank you for clapping
at my political gazebo material.


791
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.636
I'm very brave.

792
00:44:26.472 --> 00:44:28.557
I've never really cared about politics.

793
00:44:29.516 --> 00:44:30.934
Never talked about 'em much.

794
00:44:35.022 --> 00:44:39.985
But then, last November,
the strangest thing happened.


795
00:44:40.068 --> 00:44:41.153
[audience laughing]

796
00:44:41.737 --> 00:44:45.240
Now, I don't know
if you've been following the news,


797
00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:48.702
but I've been keeping my ears open

798
00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:53.791
and it seems like everyone everywhere
is super-mad about everything


799
00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:55.125
all the time.

800
00:44:56.335 --> 00:44:58.378
I try to stay a little optimistic,

801
00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:01.381
even though I will admit,
things are getting pretty sticky.


802
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.259
Here's how I try to look at it,

803
00:45:04.593 --> 00:45:05.636
and this is just me,

804
00:45:06.428 --> 00:45:08.055
this guy being the president,

805
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.892
it's like there's a horse
loose in a hospital.


806
00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:16.396
It's like there's a horse
loose in a hospital.


807
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.274
I think eventually
everything's going to be okay,


808
00:45:19.608 --> 00:45:22.528
but I have no idea
what's going  to happen next.


809
00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:26.323
And neither do any of you,
and neither do your parents,


810
00:45:26.406 --> 00:45:29.868
because there's a horse
loose in the hospital.


811
00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.829
It's never happened before,

812
00:45:31.912 --> 00:45:34.331
no one knows what the horse
is going to do next,


813
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.166
least of all the horse.

814
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:38.836
He's never been in a hospital before,

815
00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.839
he's as confused as you are.

816
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:44.591
There's no experts.

817
00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:45.634
[audience cheering]

818
00:45:45.717 --> 00:45:48.136
They try to find experts on the news.

819
00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.890
They're like, "We're joined now by a man
that once saw a bird in the airport."


820
00:45:51.974 --> 00:45:54.101
Get out of here with that shit!

821
00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:57.604
We've all seen a bird in the airport.

822
00:45:58.146 --> 00:45:59.857
This is a horse

823
00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:02.192
loose in a hospital.

824
00:46:03.652 --> 00:46:06.613
When a horse is loose in a hospital,
you got to stay updated.


825
00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:09.825
So all day long you walk around,
"What'd the horse do?"


826
00:46:11.618 --> 00:46:13.871
The updates, they're not always bad.

827
00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.664
Sometimes they're just odd.

828
00:46:17.249 --> 00:46:19.501
It'll be like,
"The horse used the elevator?"


829
00:46:19.793 --> 00:46:22.170
[audience laughing]

830
00:46:24.923 --> 00:46:27.259
I didn't know he
knew how to do that.

831
00:46:27.342 --> 00:46:29.011
[audience laughing]

832
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:33.765
The creepiest days are when
you don't hear from the horse at all.


833
00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:35.767
[audience laughing]

834
00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:41.899
You're down in the operating room
like, "Hey, has anyone..."


835
00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:45.903
[audience laughing]

836
00:46:46.278 --> 00:46:47.112
"Has anyone heard--"

837
00:46:47.195 --> 00:46:49.281
[imitates clopping hooves]

838
00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:52.451
Those are those quiet days
when people are like,


839
00:46:52.534 --> 00:46:55.162
"It looks like the horse
has finally calmed down."


840
00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:57.497
And then ten seconds later
the horse is like,


841
00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:59.374
"I'm gonna run towards the baby incubators

842
00:46:59.458 --> 00:47:00.876
and smash 'em with my hooves.

843
00:47:00.959 --> 00:47:03.003
I've got nice hooves and a long tail,
I'm a horse!"


844
00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:06.465
That's what I thought you'd say,
you dumb fucking horse.


845
00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:07.758
And then...

846
00:47:07.841 --> 00:47:09.885
[audience cheering]

847
00:47:10.052 --> 00:47:11.136
Then...

848
00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.432
Then you go to brunch with people
and they're like,


849
00:47:15.515 --> 00:47:18.685
"There shouldn't be a horse
in the hospital."


850
00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:21.647
And it's like, "We're well past that."

851
00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.441
Then other people are like,

852
00:47:24.524 --> 00:47:26.485
"If there's gonna be a horse
in the hospital,


853
00:47:26.568 --> 00:47:27.986
I'm going to say the N-word on TV."

854
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.573
And those don't match up at all.

855
00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.370
And then, for a second, it seemed like
maybe we could survive the horse,


856
00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:40.832
and then, 5,000 miles away,
a hippo was like,


857
00:47:40.916 --> 00:47:42.918
"I have a nuclear bomb

858
00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.630
and I'm going to blow up the hospital!"

859
00:47:47.214 --> 00:47:49.633
And before we could say anything,
the horse was like,


860
00:47:49.716 --> 00:47:54.638
"If you even fucking look at the hospital,
I will stomp you to death with my hooves.


861
00:47:54.721 --> 00:47:57.140
I dare you to do it.
I want you to do it.


862
00:47:57.391 --> 00:48:01.687
I want you to do it so I can stomp you
with my hooves, I'm so fucking crazy."


863
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.856
"You think you're fucking crazy,
I'm a fucking hippopotamus.


864
00:48:05.065 --> 00:48:09.361
I live in a fucking lake of mud.
I'm fucking crazy."


865
00:48:09.444 --> 00:48:14.366
And all of us are like, "Okay."

866
00:48:14.533 --> 00:48:17.786
Like poor Andy Cohen
at those goddamn reunions.


867
00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:21.039
"Okay."

868
00:48:22.582 --> 00:48:24.292
And then, for a second, we were like,

869
00:48:24.376 --> 00:48:27.462
"Maybe the horse-catcher
will catch the horse."


870
00:48:27.546 --> 00:48:30.924
And then the horse is like,
"I have fired the horse-catcher."


871
00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:33.927
[audience laughing]

872
00:48:35.387 --> 00:48:36.805
He can do that?

873
00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:41.351
That shouldn't be allowed
no matter who the horse is.


874
00:48:42.477 --> 00:48:44.646
I don't remember that in <i>Hamilton.</i>

875
00:48:45.397 --> 00:48:47.357
[audience laughing]

876
00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:51.737
Sometimes, if you make fun of the horse,
people will get upset.


877
00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.948
These are the people
that opened the door for the horse.


878
00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.951
I don't judge anyone.

879
00:48:58.243 --> 00:48:59.619
But sometimes I ask people.

880
00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:03.540
I go, "Hey, how come you opened the door
for the horse?"


881
00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.419
And they go,
"Well, the hospital was inefficient!"


882
00:49:09.588 --> 00:49:12.716
[audience laughing]

883
00:49:15.093 --> 00:49:16.303
Or sometimes they go,

884
00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:18.555
"If you're so mad at the horse,
how come you weren't mad


885
00:49:18.638 --> 00:49:20.766
when the last guy did <i>this</i>
three and a half years ago?


886
00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:22.267
You're beating up on the horse

887
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.978
when the last guy essentially did
the same thing five years ago."


888
00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:27.522
First off, get out of here
with your facts.


889
00:49:27.606 --> 00:49:30.233
You're like the kid at the sleepover
who, after midnight, is like,


890
00:49:30.317 --> 00:49:31.443
"It's tomorrow now!"

891
00:49:31.526 --> 00:49:34.112
Get the fuck out of here
with your technicalities.


892
00:49:34.196 --> 00:49:36.990
Just 'cause you're accurate
does not mean you're interesting.


893
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:39.409
That was fun when we watched
<i>Beetlejuice</i>tonight.


894
00:49:39.493 --> 00:49:41.453
"Don't you mean last night?
It's after midnight."


895
00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:44.831
Why don't you get your sleeping bag
and get out of my house!


896
00:49:45.499 --> 00:49:49.419
Take your EpiPen, take your goddamn EpiPen
and get out of my house!


897
00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:58.178
But when people say, "How come
you were never mad at the last guy?"


898
00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.972
I say,
"Because I wasn't paying attention."


899
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.142
I used to pay less attention

900
00:50:04.518 --> 00:50:05.811
before it was a horse.

901
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.106
Also, I thought the last guy
was pretty smart,


902
00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:12.400
and he seemed good at his job,
and I'm lazy by nature.


903

00:50:13.819 --> 00:50:15.487
I'm lazy by nature too.

905
00:50:15.737 --> 00:50:19.324
So I don't check up on people
when they seem okay at their job.


906
00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:23.286
You may think that's an ignorant answer
but it's not, it's a great answer.


907
00:50:23.537 --> 00:50:25.914
If you left your baby
with your mother tonight,


908
00:50:25.997 --> 00:50:28.875
you're not going to race home
and check the nanny cam.


909
00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:32.671
But if you leave your baby
with Gary Busey...

And now there's Nazis again.

[audience laughing]

913
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:49.479
When I was a kid
Nazis was just an analogy you would use


914
00:50:49.563 --> 00:50:52.774
to decimate your child
during an argument at the dinner table.

[audience laughing]

00:50:56.236 --> 00:50:57.863
Now there's new Nazis.

917
00:50:57.946 --> 00:51:01.616
I don't care for these new Nazis
and you may quote me on that.


918
00:51:03.118 --> 00:51:07.497
These new Nazis, "Jews are the worst,
Jews ruin everything,


919
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:09.624
and Jews try to take over your life."

920
00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:13.879
It's like, "You know what, motherfucker?
My wife is Jewish.


921
00:51:14.087 --> 00:51:16.840
I know all that,
how do you know all that?"

923
00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.764
I'm allowed to make fun of my wife.

924
00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.766
I asked her and she said yes.

[audience laughing]

926
00:51:28.894 --> 00:51:31.188
I've been married
for about three and a half years now

00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:33.148
-and I was going out on tour...
-[cheering]


928
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:34.566
Thank you very much.

929
00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:37.652
And I love and
respect my wife very much.

930
00:51:37.736 --> 00:51:40.405
So I said to her, "We've been married
for three and a half years."


931
00:51:40.488 --> 00:51:41.573
And she knew that.

932
00:51:42.824 --> 00:51:46.411
I said, "Do you mind if I still make fun
of you on stage?


933
00:51:46.745 --> 00:51:49.581
And my wife said,
"Yeah, you can make fun of me.


934
00:51:50.123 --> 00:51:53.752
But just don't say that I'm a bitch
and that you don't like me."


935
00:51:53.835 --> 00:51:59.674
I was like, "The bar is so much lower
than I ever imagined.


936
00:51:59.758 --> 00:52:00.926
That's it?"

937
00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:05.347
Also, I wouldn't say that.
What kind of show would that even be?


938
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.890
Hello.

939
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.100
My wife is a bitch!

940
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:12.395
And I don't like her!

941
00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:15.649
That's like a support group
for men in crisis,


942
00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:19.277
with keynote speakers
Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin.

[audience laughing]

944
00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.783
Also, I would never say that,
not even as a joke,


945
00:52:24.866 --> 00:52:27.869
that my wife is a bitch
and I don't like her. That is not true.


946
00:52:27.953 --> 00:52:31.665
My wife is a bitch
and I like her so much.


947
00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:32.582
[audience cheering]

948
00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:37.337
She is a dynamite, five-foot, Jewish bitch
and she's the best.


949
00:52:38.213 --> 00:52:40.465
She and I have totally different styles.

950
00:52:40.548 --> 00:52:42.509
When my wife walks down the street,

951
00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:46.763
she does not give a shit what anyone
thinks of her in any situation.


952
00:52:47.013 --> 00:52:49.766
She's my hero.
When I walk down the street,


953
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.896
I need everybody, all day long,
to like me so much.


954
00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.982
It's exhausting.

955
00:52:57.732 --> 00:52:59.693
My wife said that walking around with me

956
00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:03.863
is like walking around with someone
who's running for mayor of nothing.

[audience laughing]

958

My wife and I went to Best Buy
to get a TV.


959
00:53:09.744 --> 00:53:11.579
We didn't end up getting the TV.

960
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.874
I was afraid that the Best Buy guy
was going to be mad at me,


961
00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:18.253
so I bought an HDMI cable.

962
00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:20.130
[audience laughing]

963
00:53:20.255 --> 00:53:22.716
I go to the register with Anna,
my wife's name Anna,


964
00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:25.260
she's standing next to me,
I hand the guy the HDMI cable.


965
00:53:25.343 --> 00:53:28.972
He takes it, he scans it, he says,
"Do you have a Best Buy Rewards card?"


966
00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:32.058
And I said, "No, I wish!"

967
00:53:32.183 --> 00:53:34.185
[audience laughing]

968
00:53:38.606 --> 00:53:41.693
And then my wife said,
"Jesus Christ!"


969
00:53:42.027 --> 00:53:47.115
And fully walked away from me.
Walked all the way to the laser printers


970
00:53:47.365 --> 00:53:49.993
and just stood there, <i>Blair Witch</i>style.

971
00:53:52.412 --> 00:53:54.372
And I'm still up at the register like...

972
00:53:55.915 --> 00:53:57.459
[audience laughing]

973
00:53:57.584 --> 00:54:03.381
And the guy goes,
"Do you want a Best Buy Rewards card?"


974
00:54:04.924 --> 00:54:07.010
And I said, "No."

975
00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:11.348
Even though I had just said
it was my greatest wish in life.


976
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:14.976
I was hoping he'd believe me,
that it was secretly my great wish


977
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.813
but that I'm in an abusive marriage
with little Miss Jesus Christ over here


978
00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:21.649
so I can't ask for the things I want
in public


979
00:54:21.733 --> 00:54:24.361
but at home, at night,
we argue about it and I'm like,


980
00:54:24.444 --> 00:54:27.280
"You'll see! One day
I'm going to leave you


981
00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:30.575
and I'm going to get
that Best Buy Rewards card."


982
00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:32.869
She's like, "Jesus Christ,

983
00:54:35.121 --> 00:54:38.166
you're never going to get
that Best Buy Rewards card!"


984
00:54:40.293 --> 00:54:43.254
My wife is Jewish, as I said,
I was raised Catholic.


985
00:54:43.505 --> 00:54:45.840
We have differences
in our religious upbringings


986
00:54:45.924 --> 00:54:47.509
and we realized this recently.

987
00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.595
Not with our kids,
because we don't have any kids.


988
00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:53.890
People always ask us, "Are you going
to have kids?" and we say no.


989
00:54:53.973 --> 00:54:56.935
And then they go, "Never?
You're never going to have kids?"


990
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.812
Look, I don't know "never."

991
00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:03.066
Fourteen years ago, I smoked cocaine
the night before my college graduation.


992
00:55:03.274 --> 00:55:07.153
Now I'm afraid to get a flu shot.
People change.

[audience laughing]

994
00:55:10.615 --> 00:55:13.118
But we don't have any kids now
and it's great.


995
00:55:13.535 --> 00:55:14.953
We have a dog though.

996
00:55:15.036 --> 00:55:18.164
We have a four-year-old French bulldog.
Her name is Petunia.

00:55:22.502 --> 00:55:24.629
The idea of people applauding

for that little monster.

1000
00:55:28.842 --> 00:55:32.095
Just... I mean, I would never tell her
that you applauded.


1001
00:55:32.846 --> 00:55:34.222
It would go right to her ego,

1002
00:55:34.305 --> 00:55:39.144
that little monster
who just rubs her vulva on the carpet


1003
00:55:39.644 --> 00:55:41.438
while staring at me in the eye.

1004

[imitates dog snarling]

1005
00:55:46.693 --> 00:55:49.279
I know her vulva itches
and she needs to rub it,


1006
00:55:49.362 --> 00:55:51.364
but the thumping of the back paws...

1007
00:55:53.199 --> 00:55:54.117
It's upsetting.

1008
00:55:56.077 --> 00:55:58.413
I'm just kidding.
I love Petunia very much.


1009
00:55:58.496 --> 00:56:00.999
She's one of my most favorite people
I've ever met in my life.


1010
00:56:01.416 --> 00:56:04.627
Petunia likes to be very social
but she can't walk very far


1011
00:56:04.711 --> 00:56:07.547
because she has a flat face,
so she can't breathe by design.


1012
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:11.259
But she wants to go out and meet people
but we can't walk her for that long.


1013
00:56:11.342 --> 00:56:13.219
Anyway, this is a long-winded way
of saying


1014
00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:15.430
that we bought a stroller for our dog.

pushing Petunia the French bulldog
in a stroller,


1018
00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:27.275
and it's a big stroller
and it has a big black hood.


1019
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.570
And people lean in to see the baby.

We're like, "He's sick."

[chuckles]

1026

But religion came up with Petunia
recently.


1027
00:56:56.095 --> 00:56:58.181
My wife and I were talking
about cute things


1028
00:56:58.264 --> 00:56:59.974
that Petunia could be involved in.

1029
00:57:00.934 --> 00:57:04.062
And I said, "What if we got
like a Biblical painting done


1030
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.730
with Petunia in it?"

And my wife is like,
"That would be so cute.


1032
00:57:08.399 --> 00:57:10.151
We should do like <i>The Last Supper."</i>

1033
00:57:10.235 --> 00:57:12.529
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, that would be so cute.


1034
00:57:12.612 --> 00:57:16.074
We should do all different French
Bulldogs as the different Apostles."


1035
00:57:16.282 --> 00:57:20.245
And my wife was like, "We should have
Petunia in the middle where Jesus is,


1036
00:57:20.328 --> 00:57:21.454
in front of the turkey."

1037
00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.581
And I was like,
"Wait, what did you just say?"

And my wife said, "Yeah, why?"

1041
00:57:40.014 --> 00:57:41.349
And I said...

1042

I said, "Would you just answer me
one question?

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:30.273
those guys are celebrating?"

1055
00:58:30.356 --> 00:58:33.443
She said, "Okay, I don't get this shit
because I wasn't raised Catholic


1056
00:58:33.526 --> 00:58:36.529
and I'm fucking glad I wasn't
because it's a fucked-up organization."


1057
00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:39.365
I said, "No. We all know that."

1058
00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:41.451
[audience laughing]

1059
00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.746
"But what do you think

1060
00:58:46.748 --> 00:58:48.499
those guys are celebrating?"

1061
00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.377
And my wife looked at the floor.

1062
00:58:52.545 --> 00:58:55.506
And then she looked at me and said,
"Thanksgiving."


1063
00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.091
[audience laughing]

1064
00:58:58.843 --> 00:59:02.180
My family went to church
every Sunday when I was a kid.


1065
00:59:02.263 --> 00:59:05.058
My wife cannot believe this.
She's like, "You went every Sunday?"


1066
00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:07.310
-"Yes."
-"What if you were out of town?"


1067
00:59:07.435 --> 00:59:09.020
I was like, "They
have them out of town."

1068
00:59:10.188 --> 00:59:12.649
I don't know if you grew up
going to church and now you don't,


1069
00:59:12.732 --> 00:59:13.983
but it can be a weird existence.

1070
00:59:14.067 --> 00:59:16.110
Because I like to make fun of it
all day long,


1071
00:59:16.194 --> 00:59:17.904
but then if someone like Bill Maher says,

1072
00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:20.448
"Who would believe in a man
up in the sky?"


1073
00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:23.034
I'm like, "My mommy,
so shut the fuck up!"

1074
00:59:23.117 --> 00:59:25.119
[audience cheering]

1075
00:59:25.411 --> 00:59:27.538
"Stop calling my mommy dumb."

1076
00:59:30.083 --> 00:59:33.127
If you grew up going to church
and you have adult friends that didn't,


1077
00:59:33.211 --> 00:59:36.631
they have a lot of questions.
"Wait, so they forced you to go?"


1078
00:59:36.714 --> 00:59:39.467
Yeah, I was five,
I was forced to go everywhere.


1079
00:59:40.635 --> 00:59:43.012
No kid is just going to church.

1080
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:47.850
Riding by on his Huffy, like,
"Whoa! What's this place?


1081
00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:51.270
A weird Byzantine temple
with green carpeting


1082
00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:54.065
where everyone has bad breath
and I wear clothes that I hate


1083
00:59:54.148 --> 00:59:55.983
on one of the mornings
of my two days off?


1084
00:59:56.067 --> 00:59:56.901
Let's do this."

1085
00:59:56.984 --> 00:59:58.319
[audience laughing]

1086
00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.446
But people get very suspicious.

1087
01:00:00.947 --> 01:00:02.782
They're like,
"What did they say in there?


1088
01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:06.285
What do they do?
What did they tell you?"


1089
01:00:07.412 --> 01:00:09.080
I don't know, it was an hour.

1090
01:00:10.248 --> 01:00:12.875
That should be the slogan
for the Catholic church.


1091
01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:15.753
"It's an hour!"

1092
01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:20.508
It's a few stories,
normally about a guy with a crazy name


1093
01:00:20.591 --> 01:00:22.343
whose wife has a normal name.

1094
01:00:23.177 --> 01:00:26.305
"In that town lives Zepheriuses
and his wife Rachel."


1095
01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.974
How come she gets to be Rachel?

1096
01:00:28.975 --> 01:00:31.811
"On their way to Galilee,
Jesus met Enos and Barak


1097
01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.688
and their wives, 
Kylie and Lauren."

1098
01:00:33.771 --> 01:00:36.899
And you're like, "What?
That's the same joke twice."


1099
01:00:37.525 --> 01:00:39.861
[audience laughing]

1100
01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:41.571
Then there's the homily.

1101
01:00:41.654 --> 01:00:45.950
If you're not Catholic, the homily
is when the priest does a book report


1102
01:00:47.827 --> 01:00:49.871
that is also stand-up comedy.

1103
01:00:49.996 --> 01:00:51.247
[audience laughing]

1104
01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:56.294
It normally begins with a charming
anecdote that is fake and never happened.


1105
01:00:57.837 --> 01:01:01.758
"A woman was at a shopping mall
with her young son."


1106
01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:03.342
What was the woman's name?

1107
01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:07.180
Hey, Father, what was the name
of the shopping mall?


1108
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.683
Your story doesn't have a lot of details.

1109
01:01:11.392 --> 01:01:17.106
You only had a week to work on it
and you've had the book for 2,000 years.


1110
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.858
[audience laughing]

1111
01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:22.695
And then there's some songs
normally sung by an usher.


1112
01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.989
One of these ushers
that opens the door for you


1113
01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:27.700
and gives you the pamphlet
and they all look like Marco Rubio.


1114
01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.202
[audience laughing]

1115
01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:32.580
That guy will get up
and sing into the microphone.


1116
01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:34.540
He's not a singer...

1117
01:01:35.416 --> 01:01:37.210
'cause he's not good at it.

1118
01:01:38.044 --> 01:01:41.422
But he tries. He sings the Psalms.

1119
01:01:41.506 --> 01:01:42.757
Remember the Psalms?

1120
01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:48.763
They're not songs 'cause
they don't rhyme and they're not good.


1121
01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:53.976
They're perfectly named,
they're not quite songs, they're Psalms.


1122
01:01:54.227 --> 01:01:56.270
It's a word you're meant to mishear.

1123
01:01:57.396 --> 01:01:59.232
"I'm gonna sing a Psalm today."

1124
01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.942
What's that? You're gonna sing a song?

1125
01:02:01.025 --> 01:02:02.652
"Yeah. It's a Psalm."

1126
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:06.906
And then these guys get up
in front of everyone and they're like...


1127
01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:11.619
<i>♪ The bread of God is bread ♪</i>

1128
01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:17.166
<i>♪ He will bring us bread ♪</i>

1129
01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:21.170
<i>♪ No one but
the one from Jericho ♪</i>

1130
01:02:21.796 --> 01:02:27.969
<i>♪ Can bring bread to bread ♪</i>

1131
01:02:28.553 --> 01:02:30.304
And then the guy goes like this.

1132
01:02:31.556 --> 01:02:33.558
[audience laughing]

1133
01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:36.018
And that means
we're supposed to sing our lines,


1134
01:02:36.102 --> 01:02:39.313
except we don't know our lines for shit.

1135
01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.483
Where's that pamphlet?
Where's that pamphlet they gave us?


1136
01:02:42.733 --> 01:02:45.361
Move the jackets.

1137
01:02:45.444 --> 01:02:46.654
Ah-ha-ha!

1138
01:02:46.737 --> 01:02:51.617
<i>♪ The bread of bread is bread ♪</i>

1139
01:02:51.909 --> 01:02:55.955
<i>♪ Bread is God is bread ♪</i>

1140
01:02:56.038 --> 01:03:00.793
It's just dads singing so loud,

1141
01:03:01.294 --> 01:03:04.088
thinking that'll somehow get their kids
to sing.


1142
01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:09.051
<i>♪ Bread is God is bread ♪</i>

1143
01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:12.513
<i>♪ Is God is bread ♪</i>

1144
01:03:12.597 --> 01:03:14.640
<i>♪ Is God is bread... ♪</i>

1145
01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.183
"Sing, goddamn it!"

1146
01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:22.398
My dad once grabbed me by the shirt
and lifted me up during church


1147
01:03:22.481 --> 01:03:25.192
and said, "God can't hear you."
