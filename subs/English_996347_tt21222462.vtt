00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.331
<i>According
to the CDC,</i>


2
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.508
<i>overdose deaths
have tripled...</i>


3
00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:30.817
<i>The numbers continue
to surge...</i>


4
00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:33.157
Barry?
One second.


5
00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:36.203
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah.


6
00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:38.118
It's on my desk?

7
00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:41.034
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah. I need it today.


8
00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:42.862
Oh, yeah.
I have that. Hum...


9
00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:45.648
Sorry. I got an insane
number of hits


10
00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:47.650
on those democratic donkey
videos I posted last week,


11
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.609
so I've been trying to crank
those out, but I have it.


12
00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:52.045
Great, great...

13
00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:02.186
Listen, Thomas.

14
00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:04.014
What you're proposing,
however clickable,


15
00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:06.146
does it really feel like news?

16
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.367
And that remains
our first obligation.


17
00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:11.717
We understand we're getting
clobbered on physical,


18
00:05:11.717 --> 00:05:14.807
but we need to use the election
as a barometer.


19
00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:17.462
If paper doesn't start moving
in six months,


20
00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:19.986
then we'll know the jig is up,

21
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.554
but we have to follow
the rules now.


22
00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:24.556
It's a new age.

23
00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.341
That's not what
I'm fighting, here.


24
00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:29.692
I've been around long enough
to recognize a sea change...


25
00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:32.912
...but we have to be able
to do our job.


26
00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:37.090
Okay, so let's please move on,
so we can get


27
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.006
to the very important work
I know you all have.


28
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.270
Gill, you said it was
a heavy night?


29
00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:45.838
Sorry to interrupt.

30
00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:47.710
Toby?

31
00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.541
I need to talk to Marissa, something...

32
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.152
What's going on?

33
00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:56.675
Something...
something's wrong.


34
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.596
Okay, back to business.

35
00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.945
Gill, what do you got?

36
00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:07.512
Homicide in Arbor Hill,

37
00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:09.427
young kid gunned down...

38
00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:14.274
You can't blame yourself
for this one.


39
00:07:14.797 --> 00:07:15.972
Mm.

40
00:07:34.686 --> 00:07:36.862
Such a sudden loss.

41
00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:40.562
We pray that that this family
might find peace


42
00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:43.303
in the promise of God's
almighty kingdom.


43
00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:47.003
And while there are no words
which can undo


44
00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:50.441
the anger and despair
of such a tragedy,


45
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:53.183
we pray that those
who have gathered


46
00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:57.013
show this grieving family
that they are not alone


47
00:07:57.013 --> 00:07:58.667
in their sorrow,

48
00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:02.758
that the son we have lost
is surrounded by love.


49
00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:07.763
Now, in such tragic circumstances,

50
00:08:07.763 --> 00:08:12.202
we're sometimes tempted
by rage to dismiss God's plan...


51
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.074
...to lose our own place...

52
00:08:15.074 --> 00:08:16.815
- It's not worth it.
- ...in his mercy.


53
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.078
But we must remember...

54
00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:20.732
You knew she'd be here.

55
00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:23.126
...that death is but another
step closer to God.


56
00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:36.618
- I'll never forget him.
- Thanks so much.


57
00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:39.534
Thank you.

58
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.931
Mrs. Bennings,
I'm pregnant.


59
00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.587
Ma, what the fuck
are you doing?


60
00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:09.520
I'm sorry I hit you.

61
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.435
I wouldn't if I had known.

62
00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:13.263
Yeah, I know.

63
00:09:14.394 --> 00:09:16.222
Just because of your
condition, doesn't mean I...


64
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.789
Look, you don't need
to like me.


65
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:22.881
Just this weird, shrivelled
little person.


66
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.754
You sure it's his?

67
00:09:25.754 --> 00:09:27.712
Yeah, unless someone
snuck into my pussy


68
00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:28.974
and forgot it there.

69
00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:34.110
You know, I didn't
make him a junkie.


70
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.372
No, I don't know that.

71
00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:37.853
I know you made him a thief.

72
00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:40.159
He had never stolen anything
from me in his life before you.


73
00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.770
Is this really
about the Vitamix?


74
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.206
No. It's about the lying,

75
00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:45.643
stealing, money, jewelry,
and then the Vitamix.


76
00:09:45.643 --> 00:09:47.602
He gave that to me
for my fortieth birthday.


77
00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:49.429
- You never used it.
- And you did?


78
00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:59.135
How was he living?

79
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.269
We got our own place
to get clean.


80
00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:06.359
He'd been having these freakouts

81
00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:09.275
and getting really sick,
and he was scared.


82
00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:13.062
Was he still dealing?

83
00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:14.716
Well, that's the thing,
he had stopped.


84
00:10:14.716 --> 00:10:16.456
When all that tainted shit
came through here,


85
00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:18.067
he decided it was time
to get away.


86
00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:21.026
He was looking to buy
this place near Chatham.


87
00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.246
He was excited
to start a family.


88
00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.639
Buy a place?

89
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.336
How was he going to afford
to buy a place?


90
00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:28.730
He made it sound like Ducky
and him had it all figured out.


91
00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:30.862
He was still hanging out
with Ducky?


92
00:10:30.862 --> 00:10:32.037
Oh, yeah.

93
00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:34.605
He was like a brother
to both of us.


94
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:45.094
Look, I didn't come here
to argue or beg or whatever.


95
00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:47.531
I'm here because
I loved Michael,


96
00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:49.751
and I'm sad he's gone,
and I know that you are too.


97
00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.623
Even if you're only capable
of being mad right now,


98
00:10:52.623 --> 00:10:53.842
I know that really,
you're just sad.


99
00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:25.656
Yeah, I miss him, too.

100
00:12:40.252 --> 00:12:42.037
You got it, Mike!

101
00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.784
It's okay, kiddo!
That was a good pitch!


102
00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:36.918
Who do you think
did it?


103
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:40.573
Well, we've got a lead,

104
00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:42.706
but I don't think that's

105
00:13:42.706 --> 00:13:44.621
what you should be thinking
about right now.


106
00:13:48.407 --> 00:13:49.452
Ugh.

107
00:13:49.974 --> 00:13:51.106
Okay.

108
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.065
You remember Mike's friend,
Ducky?


109
00:13:54.892 --> 00:13:56.285
Everett Dukowski.

110
00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:57.460
Yeah, of course.

111
00:13:58.417 --> 00:13:59.941
Well, at this point we're
pretty certain


112
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:01.638
Everett's responsible
for bringing fentanyl


113
00:14:01.638 --> 00:14:02.726
to the South End.

114
00:14:03.814 --> 00:14:05.163
That shit is brutal.

115
00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:07.992
Junkies who get tied up in it

116
00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:10.125
don't last long,
one way or another.


117
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.348
So, Michael
was tied up in it?


118
00:14:17.872 --> 00:14:20.787
We think him and Ducky might
have been in business together,


119
00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:23.138
selling this Mother's Milk shit,

120
00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:25.140
heroin, coke and fentanyl.

121
00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:29.535
Maybe there was a fight between
them or a deal gone wrong.


122
00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:31.973
What makes you think that?

123
00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:33.539
Mike was killed up the block

124
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.585
from one of Ducky's
stash houses.


125
00:14:35.585 --> 00:14:37.587
And he matches a description
from a neighbour.


126
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.721
When was the last time
you saw him? Mike?


127
00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:47.597
I don't know, three,
four months ago, maybe.


128
00:14:48.946 --> 00:14:50.948
Well, you got me beat.

129
00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:11.751
Jesus, you still haven't
thrown that thing out yet?


130
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.885
It helps.

131
00:15:15.973 --> 00:15:18.019
I figured it would
make it harder.


132
00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:20.673
Not if you don't carry
a light.


133
00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:24.939
Alright, give me
a fucking drag.


134
00:15:32.294 --> 00:15:33.556
Mmm.

135
00:15:34.861 --> 00:15:35.950
Wow.

136
00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:38.822
Pretending kind of does help.

137
00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:46.003
I'll get Ducky, I promise.

138
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.607
Come in!

139
00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:32.789
Marissa, what are you
doing here?


140
00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:36.358
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't too buried without me.


141
00:16:38.012 --> 00:16:40.840
Yeah, everything's
going okay.


142
00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:43.147
That's great.

143
00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:44.931
Um...

144
00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:48.805
We weren't expecting you back
for a month at least.


145
00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:53.984
How are you holding up?

146
00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:56.595
I want to come back to work.

147
00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:03.472
You took three months off
for Frank.


148
00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:05.474
Yeah, that was different.

149
00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:07.215
I need to come back.

150
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.566
And tell me what that
looks like to you.


151
00:17:14.004 --> 00:17:15.788
Same thing as it did before.

152
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:18.139
You hate editing.

153
00:17:21.142 --> 00:17:23.492
Walk out there right now and
look at the shit


154
00:17:23.492 --> 00:17:25.320
that Barry's been writing
since you've been gone.


155
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.625
Fucking Barry?

156
00:17:27.974 --> 00:17:30.977
The one who turned the A and C
section into a donkey show?


157
00:17:30.977 --> 00:17:33.110
Okay, let's take
a second here.


158
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.635
You hate Barry
and all those guys out there.


159
00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:38.333
Why?

160
00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:40.987
Because they aren't writers.

161
00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.600
They're all about numbers
and formatting


162
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.602
and words per click,
or whatever.


163
00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:49.953
Hell, you barely know
what the Internet does.


164
00:17:51.607 --> 00:17:54.349
Marissa, you are my best writer,

165
00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:56.873
but for some reason,
you refuse to write.


166
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.965
Take your time, but write.

167
00:18:19.852 --> 00:18:21.941
Alright, clean.

168
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:24.596
Bullshit, it's touching
my ball.


169
00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:26.250
Watch and learn, sucker.

170
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.732
- Lucky.

171
00:18:29.732 --> 00:18:31.560
I learned from the best.

172
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.561
Another.

173
00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:37.914
Alright, your shot.

174
00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:43.049
She didn't even want to join.

175
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:45.574
She didn't want to intrude.

176
00:18:46.401 --> 00:18:49.143
She said we should have
some alone time together


177
00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:50.753
to just grieve.

178
00:18:52.146 --> 00:18:53.669
Is that what we're doing?

179
00:19:01.024 --> 00:19:02.286
You going to be okay, Mom?

180
00:19:03.026 --> 00:19:05.289
One ball at a time.

181
00:20:12.095 --> 00:20:13.488
Watch this, to the left!

182
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.012
Let's make this quick!

183
00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:27.371
A leather case.

184
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:34.770
It's got to be here somewhere.

185
00:20:49.872 --> 00:20:51.439
There's a back room.

186
00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.224
Oh, fuck.

187
00:20:56.574 --> 00:20:57.749
There!

188
00:22:14.652 --> 00:22:15.914
What are you doing?

189
00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:18.700
I've always wanted
to do that.


190
00:22:25.141 --> 00:22:26.708
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

191
00:22:27.665 --> 00:22:29.363
What's that?

192
00:22:29.363 --> 00:22:32.191
Paige said that Michael,
Ducky and her


193
00:22:32.191 --> 00:22:35.281
were moving into a farm,
or a house,


194
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:36.631
something in Chatham?

195
00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:39.938
Mike, a farmer?

196
00:22:41.897 --> 00:22:44.465
I know.
It doesn't make sense.


197
00:22:46.728 --> 00:22:49.034
Listen, you've got to be
careful with that girl.


198
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.480
What the fuck are you
doing here?


199
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.785
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

200
00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:02.178
Sorry, I meant to stay awake.

201
00:23:02.178 --> 00:23:03.440
What are you doing here?

202
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.355
Someone broke into my house,

203
00:23:05.355 --> 00:23:08.619
and I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.


204
00:23:10.578 --> 00:23:11.883
Were you hurt?

205
00:23:11.883 --> 00:23:13.407
Did you see who it was?

206
00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:15.757
No, but I found this.

207
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.414
Hum... I think it's what
they were looking for.


208
00:23:20.414 --> 00:23:22.720
I found it right before
they came in.


209
00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:25.114
What is that?

210
00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:28.160
That's about $50,000 worth
of dirty heroin.


211
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.787
I like the other way better.

212
00:23:47.005 --> 00:23:48.180
Me too.

213
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.660
This baby business is tough

214
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.923
but Whatever works, right?
- Right.


215
00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:01.803
How was she tonight?

216
00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:03.457
Drunk.

217
00:24:05.371 --> 00:24:06.416
Did she cry?

218
00:24:07.939 --> 00:24:10.594
She said she'd already
cried for him.


219
00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.205
The drinking isn't
going to help.


220
00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:16.078
Remember how bad it got
after Frank?


221
00:24:16.078 --> 00:24:18.994
- Yeah. I definitely remember.

222
00:24:20.822 --> 00:24:22.606
Hey, Mom.
What's going on?


223
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.567
Yeah, I recognize the logo.

224
00:24:28.307 --> 00:24:30.005
This is the shit
I was telling you about.


225
00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:31.702
You're not going
to charge her, right?


226
00:24:33.487 --> 00:24:34.618
No.

227
00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:36.925
You did the right thing.

228
00:24:37.795 --> 00:24:39.884
Is this everything?
- Everything?


229
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:44.280
Any chance you saw the person
that broke in?


230
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.977
No, I got out pretty quick.

231
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.547
So, what does this mean?

232
00:24:50.547 --> 00:24:52.767
- I'm going to take this...
- This means shit just got real.


233
00:24:53.463 --> 00:24:54.856
Somebody called him that night.

234
00:24:54.856 --> 00:24:56.292
He left all freaked out,

235
00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:58.555
I had no idea what was going on,
and then, bam!


236
00:24:58.555 --> 00:25:00.470
You know who called him,
Paige?


237
00:25:01.558 --> 00:25:02.994
It was Ducky.

238
00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:08.043
Alright?

239
00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.611
We checked his phone.

240
00:25:13.048 --> 00:25:14.005
Thank you, Paige.

241
00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:16.225
I'm going to take this
to the station.


242
00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:17.313
Okay?

243
00:25:27.584 --> 00:25:29.804
I'll get you a blanket
for the couch.


244
00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:31.936
Thank you.

245
00:25:53.915 --> 00:25:55.394
Did my puking wake you up?

246
00:25:56.395 --> 00:25:57.396
No.

247
00:25:57.396 --> 00:25:58.746
You feeling any better?

248
00:26:00.008 --> 00:26:01.400
Not at all.

249
00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:05.883
Did you ever have
any weird cravings


250
00:26:05.883 --> 00:26:07.276
when you were pregnant?

251
00:26:09.887 --> 00:26:11.410
Necco wafers.

252
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.977
What the hell's
a necco wafer?


253
00:26:12.977 --> 00:26:16.198
It's like this little
disk-shaped candy, you know?


254
00:26:16.198 --> 00:26:18.809
It tastes like...
tastes like chalk.


255
00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:20.811
I must have eaten
my body weight in them.


256
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:23.031
I want Play-doh.

257
00:26:23.988 --> 00:26:25.076
Play-doh?

258
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.252
That can't be good for the baby.

259
00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.993
Kids eat it all the time
and they're fine.


260
00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:32.344
Well, you should ask
your doctor about that.


261
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.306
Yeah.

262
00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:39.743
You have a doctor, right?

263
00:26:40.831 --> 00:26:43.660
Yeah, well, we went to one
straight when we found out,


264
00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.619
but the budget
was pretty tight, so...


265
00:26:46.402 --> 00:26:49.318
We were saving up to go again.

266
00:26:49.318 --> 00:26:52.190
Come on, you need
to see a doctor.


267
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.845
- What, right now?
- No, like a month ago,


268
00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:57.587
but yeah, now's better
than later.


269
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.811
Uh, I have to stop by work,
but it won't take long.


270
00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:06.814
I'll give you a ride home
when I'm done.


271
00:27:07.902 --> 00:27:09.686
Depends on what you mean
by "home".


272
00:27:13.385 --> 00:27:15.083
- I'll see you soon.
- See you.


273
00:27:20.741 --> 00:27:22.917
<i>Pick up the phone,
come on!</i>


274
00:27:22.917 --> 00:27:26.572
<i>I just wanted to say that
I figured some things out</i>


275
00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:30.402
<i>and I have a plan, you know.</i>

276
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.059
<i>They said it made sense. I...</i>

277
00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:40.761
<i>I know you were right
to kick me out of the house...</i>


278
00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:46.027
<i>...but, you know, a little bit
of fucking cash right now</i>


279
00:27:46.027 --> 00:27:48.246
<i>would really go a long way
to getting...</i>


280
00:27:49.552 --> 00:27:51.162
<i>I know you're in the house!</i>

281
00:27:51.162 --> 00:27:53.556
<i>I can see you moving
in the house!</i>


282
00:27:54.862 --> 00:27:56.907
<i>Let me in, it's my shit!</i>

283
00:27:56.907 --> 00:27:59.344
<i>You changed the fucking
locks, Mom!</i>


284
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.520
<i>What the... Mom!</i>

285
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.523
<i>Hey, Mom, I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>


286
00:28:04.523 --> 00:28:08.397
<i>I just want to say...</i>
<i>Happy birthday...</i>


287
00:28:08.397 --> 00:28:10.007
<i>So does Paige.</i>

288
00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:13.881
<i>Um, I want you to know that
we're doing a lot better.</i>


289
00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:16.971
<i>Um, there's something I want
to tell you in person.</i>


290
00:28:18.407 --> 00:28:19.843
<i>I love you so much.</i>

291
00:28:20.844 --> 00:28:22.193
<i>Bye.</i>

292
00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:41.865
Are you fucking serious?

293
00:28:46.217 --> 00:28:47.523
Paige?

294
00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:49.307
It's Gina.

295
00:28:49.307 --> 00:28:50.439
Hey!

296
00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:52.310
What are you doing here?

297
00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:55.357
Um, same as me, I guess.

298
00:28:55.357 --> 00:28:57.402
Marissa's supposed
to be picking me up.


299
00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:58.708
Oh.

300
00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:01.667
Do you mind if I join you?

301
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:03.757
Sure.

302
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.415
Ugh...

303
00:29:12.853 --> 00:29:14.071
I like your necklace.

304
00:29:16.204 --> 00:29:17.596
I stole it from Target.

305
00:29:17.596 --> 00:29:20.599
- It suits you, I guess.

306
00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:22.819
Thanks.

307
00:29:23.907 --> 00:29:26.170
Uh, I just mean...

308
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.042
No, it's okay.
I know what you meant.


309
00:29:28.782 --> 00:29:30.087
Sorry.

310
00:29:33.482 --> 00:29:34.875
Can I ask you a question?

311
00:29:35.614 --> 00:29:37.703
What's it like being
married to a cop?


312
00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:41.925
Um, it's not so different
from anything else.


313
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.060
There's just a part of you
that accepts


314
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.801
he might not come home one day.

315
00:29:50.368 --> 00:29:52.370
Sounds a lot like dating
a junkie.


316
00:29:57.898 --> 00:29:59.421
She's not fucking coming.

317
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.249
I can give you a ride.

318
00:30:02.903 --> 00:30:04.600
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.


319
00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:31.148
Didn't go so well
at work, huh?


320
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.020
Sorry, I forgot.

321
00:30:34.282 --> 00:30:35.936
You had important things
to do.


322
00:30:35.936 --> 00:30:37.763
- Stop it.

323
00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:39.504
No, you fucking stop it!

324
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.897
Excuse me?

325
00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:42.812
You just keep fucking hiding
from everything,


326
00:30:42.812 --> 00:30:44.118
and it's really fucking hard
to look at.


327
00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:45.336
It's shitty for all of us.

328
00:30:45.336 --> 00:30:46.598
Just stop pretending
you're alone.


329
00:30:54.737 --> 00:30:56.695
I want to go back to Al
-Anon.

330
00:30:57.609 --> 00:30:58.872
Well, that's a good start.

331
00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:02.788
I'll come with you, make sure
it's not a drunk promise.


332
00:31:02.788 --> 00:31:03.877
Mm.

333
00:31:20.241 --> 00:31:21.807
For what it's worth,
Michael used to say


334
00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:23.461
you were a really good writer.

335
00:31:25.986 --> 00:31:27.248
Oh, yeah?

336
00:31:29.772 --> 00:31:31.252
What else did he say?

337
00:31:35.734 --> 00:31:37.562
He said that before
Frank died,


338
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.173
he remembered you were happy.

339
00:31:44.874 --> 00:31:46.267
When did he say that?

340
00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:47.442
All the time.

341
00:31:48.182 --> 00:31:49.792
I wish I got to meet him.

342
00:31:51.185 --> 00:31:54.057
No, well then you'd know...

343
00:31:54.057 --> 00:31:55.972
you'd know what
an asshole he was.


344
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.714
Even when he got sick?

345
00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.672
Especially when he got sick.

346
00:32:02.936 --> 00:32:04.111
Yeah, but...

347
00:32:07.027 --> 00:32:08.550
Did you ever stop missing him?

348
00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:14.121
Never.

349
00:32:18.734 --> 00:32:20.562
Well, that's a drag.

350
00:32:24.174 --> 00:32:25.959
Oh, god.

351
00:32:27.873 --> 00:32:29.788
- Who's that?
- That's Toby.


352
00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:32.095
- Oh, man.
- Look at his hair.


353
00:32:32.095 --> 00:32:33.488
Sweet.

354
00:32:33.488 --> 00:32:35.055
We should get yours
one of these.


355
00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:37.100
It makes nursing easier.
- Yeah?


356
00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:49.983
I'm going to bed.

357
00:32:50.809 --> 00:32:51.941
Okay.

358
00:32:52.724 --> 00:32:53.725
Goodnight.

359
00:32:54.248 --> 00:32:55.379
Goodnight.

360
00:33:09.698 --> 00:33:11.830
I think I still have
one of these at the house,


361
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.049
believe it or not.

362
00:33:13.049 --> 00:33:14.311
Mm-hmm.

363
00:33:16.052 --> 00:33:17.793
Oh, hey, we could use these,

364
00:33:17.793 --> 00:33:19.838
especially if we go
with the pump.


365
00:33:20.796 --> 00:33:21.927
Yeah...

366
00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:23.668
Nothing?

367
00:33:24.626 --> 00:33:27.672
Okay, well, I'm glad it's
my baby we're shopping for.


368
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.152
Oh, fuck yes!

369
00:33:29.152 --> 00:33:30.327
Excuse me?

370
00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:33.113
- We got a lead.
- A what?


371
00:33:33.113 --> 00:33:34.549
We got a lead.

372
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.685
Let them do their investigation,
but in the meantime,


373
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.340
it can't hurt to get the story
ourselves, you know?


374
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.386
I mean, maybe it'll be the same
thing they told the cops,


375
00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:47.083
but I want to hear it myself.

376
00:33:47.083 --> 00:33:48.867
Listen, it's something
we can actually do


377
00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:50.826
instead of sitting
around moping.


378
00:33:50.826 --> 00:33:52.175
It's a lead!

379
00:33:52.175 --> 00:33:54.047
You know, this isn't
ethical or legal.


380
00:33:54.047 --> 00:33:55.352
Sure it is.

381
00:34:14.023 --> 00:34:15.068
- Hey.
- Jeremy?


382
00:34:15.068 --> 00:34:16.069
Come on in.

383
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:17.200
I heard the shots,

384
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.854
but Jack was the one who saw it.

385
00:34:20.116 --> 00:34:21.944
He's a little out of it
from his meds.


386
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.381
Grandpa sits a lot
because of his hip.


387
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:26.166
He was sitting right
there when it happened.


388
00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:28.168
Hi, Jack, nice to meet you.

389
00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:29.430
I'm Marissa.

390
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.519
I work for the Times Union.

391
00:34:32.433 --> 00:34:34.217
So, you saw what happened?

392
00:34:35.566 --> 00:34:38.482
Grandpa, you remember
what happened the other night?


393
00:34:39.875 --> 00:34:41.442
Marissa's son was shot.

394
00:34:41.442 --> 00:34:43.400
He was killed, remember?

395
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.881
He was the one you saw die
in front of the house.


396
00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:47.230
That's too bad.

397
00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.276
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:49.276 --> 00:34:51.582
I thought you said he saw
what happened that night.


399
00:34:51.582 --> 00:34:53.976
Come on, nothing?
- Paige, hey.


400
00:34:53.976 --> 00:34:55.978
Jack, just think.
Please, just think.


401
00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:57.980
- Let's not be rude.
- I'm not being rude.


402
00:34:58.633 --> 00:35:01.592
Grandpa, you said there was
someone outside yelling,


403
00:35:01.592 --> 00:35:02.898
and then...
- With the truck?


404
00:35:02.898 --> 00:35:04.465
Yeah, with the truck.

405
00:35:08.338 --> 00:35:12.342
The boy was standing in the
street yelling his head off.


406
00:35:12.342 --> 00:35:14.910
Then, I heard the truck.

407
00:35:15.998 --> 00:35:18.305
I think the kid he was
calling for lives there,


408
00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:20.176
because I've seen him
there before.


409
00:35:20.176 --> 00:35:21.482
Ducky!

410
00:35:34.756 --> 00:35:36.061
Hope
that was helpful.


411
00:36:18.278 --> 00:36:20.367
- Hey, Laurie.
- Hey.


412
00:36:21.194 --> 00:36:22.369
How you been?

413
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.893
Just getting by.

414
00:36:24.893 --> 00:36:27.200
Thank you for being here, everyone.

415
00:36:28.244 --> 00:36:31.116
Come, come into the circle.

416
00:36:31.813 --> 00:36:33.162
Have a seat.

417
00:36:33.162 --> 00:36:34.859
It's a sunny day and we're all
in a basement,


418
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:38.123
but we're going to get to know
each other and talk.


419
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.346
I see some new faces, welcome.

420
00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:46.915
And some who we haven't seen
for a while.


421
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.439
It's good to have you back.

422
00:36:50.484 --> 00:36:51.702
Our...

423
00:36:52.834 --> 00:36:54.792
We had you in our prayers.

424
00:36:54.792 --> 00:37:00.276
Uh, okay, so, who wants
to start us off today?


425
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.020
Any thoughts? Any...

426
00:37:05.368 --> 00:37:07.327
Oh, Laurie!

427
00:37:10.808 --> 00:37:17.206
I lost my daughter, Jessica,
about three months ago now.


428
00:37:20.688 --> 00:37:21.863
Haven't...

429
00:37:22.864 --> 00:37:24.431
... haven't really felt capable

430
00:37:24.431 --> 00:37:27.085
of sharing too much about it
until now.


431
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.871
I'm sure a lot of you
know the feeling.


432
00:37:31.786 --> 00:37:32.961
Mm.

433
00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:37.139
Jessica was a hard kid to raise.

434
00:37:38.488 --> 00:37:43.145
I think, sometimes, we paint
our kids as saints.


435
00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:49.064
Jessica was not a saint...

436
00:37:50.065 --> 00:37:51.284
...the opposite.

437
00:37:51.284 --> 00:37:53.329
She was kind of a pain
in the ass.


438
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:59.553
So, anyway, the morning
I found her,


439
00:37:59.553 --> 00:38:01.076
I was about to go to work,

440
00:38:01.076 --> 00:38:03.121
so I went to her room
to wake her up.


441
00:38:18.354 --> 00:38:22.184
You don't realize it
at the time...


442
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:27.232
...but that walk to the door
is the last time


443
00:38:27.232 --> 00:38:30.540
you are who you think you are.

444
00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:35.023
But you don't know.

445
00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:37.373
I didn't know.

446
00:38:39.288 --> 00:38:43.814
So, I opened the door,
and there she is,


447
00:38:43.814 --> 00:38:47.165
laying on the bed,
fully clothed,


448
00:38:47.165 --> 00:38:49.167
candles lit around her.

449
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:54.172
At first, I was furious.

450
00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:58.481
You know, she had fallen asleep
with candles burning.


451
00:38:59.134 --> 00:39:02.442
And I start screaming at her,
"Are you crazy?


452
00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:05.358
You're going to burn
the house down."


453
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:19.241
And then, I see it, a tiny
little bag on the carpet.


454
00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:23.288
And I... I just look at it.

455
00:39:26.204 --> 00:39:28.816
I remember the logo on the bag.

456
00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:31.514
It's seared into my head,
you know?


457
00:39:33.298 --> 00:39:35.213
M.M.

458
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.174
When you see something
like that,


459
00:39:39.174 --> 00:39:41.394
you know, everything cracks.

460
00:39:42.612 --> 00:39:44.919
The stories you made crack.

461
00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:49.402
Who you thought
your kid was cracks.


462
00:39:49.402 --> 00:39:53.449
Who you thought you were cracks.

463
00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:57.322
You're that family, now.

464
00:39:59.107 --> 00:40:02.415
You never realized
you were that family.


465
00:40:22.217 --> 00:40:24.785
Hey, I'm going to walk back.

466
00:40:26.177 --> 00:40:28.179
You should offer Laurie a ride.

467
00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:31.008
Uh, I'm pretty sure she wants
to be left alone.


468
00:40:31.008 --> 00:40:32.575
No, that's what you want.

469
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.622
I'm going to check
some of Ducky's spots.


470
00:40:49.374 --> 00:40:51.507
Hey, Laurie. Hey!

471
00:40:51.507 --> 00:40:52.726
Marissa!

472
00:40:52.726 --> 00:40:54.292
Do you want a ride?

473
00:41:27.195 --> 00:41:29.545
I can't believe I'm actually
going to ask this, but...


474
00:41:31.547 --> 00:41:33.070
...could I interview you?

475
00:41:33.941 --> 00:41:35.464
Interview me?

476
00:41:35.464 --> 00:41:38.336
You... put some things
into words


477
00:41:38.336 --> 00:41:40.556
I haven't been able to yet.

478
00:41:40.556 --> 00:41:43.559
You know all that stuff
is confidential, right?


479
00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:46.562
Yeah, of course.
That's the point.


480
00:41:46.562 --> 00:41:49.696
I want you to talk to me on the
record, you know, mom to mom.


481
00:41:50.392 --> 00:41:51.567
For what?

482
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.093
Well, I don't know yet.

483
00:41:56.093 --> 00:41:59.880
But baybe if I write it,
I'll know.


484
00:42:02.317 --> 00:42:03.536
Thanks again.

485
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.364
Hey, what's going on here?

486
00:42:06.364 --> 00:42:11.369
This is a safe injection site
and needle exchange for users.


487
00:42:12.327 --> 00:42:13.589
What?

488
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:16.505
Maybe if my baby had gone
to one of these


489
00:42:16.505 --> 00:42:20.291
instead of hiding in her room,
she wouldn't have died.


490
00:42:22.076 --> 00:42:24.382
This at least takes
that danger away.


491
00:42:28.386 --> 00:42:30.214
You should come check it out.

492
00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:35.176
If helping and healing
is actually what you want,


493
00:42:35.176 --> 00:42:38.005
you really need to see it
for what it is.


494
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.340
- Alright, ready?
- Yeah.


495
00:43:18.915 --> 00:43:21.439
Hey, John.
Hey, Diane.


496
00:43:21.439 --> 00:43:24.747
Marissa, this is Diane.

497
00:43:24.747 --> 00:43:29.230
She coordinates the distribution
of fentanyl test strips.


498
00:43:30.666 --> 00:43:33.887
She tells me where to go,
how to help,


499
00:43:33.887 --> 00:43:36.193
how to stay out of...

500
00:43:36.193 --> 00:43:37.586
Hey, you okay?

501
00:43:37.586 --> 00:43:38.935
Marissa?

502
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:41.372
Uh, excuse me.

503
00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:52.993
<i>You're looking
for Toby Bennings.</i>


504
00:43:52.993 --> 00:43:54.647
<i>Leave a message.</i>

505
00:43:54.647 --> 00:43:58.302
Ducky! Ducky, I just want
to talk to you!


506
00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.668
Ducky!

507
00:46:01.382 --> 00:46:03.036
- Paige!
- Hey.


508
00:46:04.689 --> 00:46:06.343
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah.


509
00:46:06.343 --> 00:46:08.128
Yeah. Everything's cool, sorry.

510
00:46:08.128 --> 00:46:10.957
I just came by to talk
to Gina, actually.


511
00:46:10.957 --> 00:46:15.352
Uh, she went out
with some friends after work,


512
00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:17.659
so she's not going to be back
until later.


513
00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:19.139
Oh, okay, of course.

514
00:46:19.139 --> 00:46:20.793
Sorry for being creepy.

515
00:46:20.793 --> 00:46:22.620
I just thought it would be nice
to talk to someone


516
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.492
who doesn't actually feel
like a parent


517
00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:27.408
and, like, actually has
their shit together.


518
00:46:27.408 --> 00:46:28.626
Yeah, I get you.

519
00:46:28.626 --> 00:46:30.063
I'll tell her you stopped by.
- Okay.


520
00:46:30.063 --> 00:46:31.891
- Have a good night.
- See you.


521
00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:38.723
Uh, Paige, if you want,
you can come in.


522
00:46:38.723 --> 00:46:40.421
- Yeah?
- In a way...


523
00:46:41.378 --> 00:46:46.035
...we're kind of family now,
so... come on.


524
00:47:16.936 --> 00:47:18.851
Fuck, you alright?

525
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.854
I thought I killed you.

526
00:47:23.594 --> 00:47:25.422
What the fuck are you doing
following me?


527
00:47:27.642 --> 00:47:28.948
You killed my son.

528
00:47:28.948 --> 00:47:30.775
No, I fucking didn't.

529
00:47:30.775 --> 00:47:32.734
You fucking believe that shit?

530
00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:38.392
So, what happened, then?

531
00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:41.656
What happened, Ducky?

532
00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:45.051
Look, all I know
is somebody called me


533
00:47:45.051 --> 00:47:46.922
and told me Mike was in trouble

534
00:47:46.922 --> 00:47:49.055
and that he needed
to get out of his house.


535
00:47:49.925 --> 00:47:52.014
So, I called him
and I told him to meet me


536
00:47:52.014 --> 00:47:53.624
at the squat house right away.

537
00:47:53.624 --> 00:47:55.452
I thought I was protecting him.

538
00:47:55.452 --> 00:47:57.150
What the fuck would you do?

539
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.847
I didn't know they were going
to fucking kill him.


540
00:47:58.847 --> 00:48:00.022
That's convenient.

541
00:48:00.022 --> 00:48:01.894
No. It sucks, Mrs. Bennings.

542
00:48:03.808 --> 00:48:05.810
I was his fucking best friend.

543
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.943
Then, who killed him?

544
00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:12.513
I never met the guy,
but he drives around


545
00:48:12.513 --> 00:48:13.949
in this white truck

546
00:48:13.949 --> 00:48:16.212
and has this fucking
stupid tattoo on his hand.


547
00:48:17.779 --> 00:48:18.911
That's all I know.

548
00:48:22.392 --> 00:48:24.133
Nobody fucking believes me.

549
00:48:26.092 --> 00:48:27.441
Ducky!

550
00:48:27.441 --> 00:48:29.878
Hey, you! What are
you doing in there?


551
00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:40.410
Holy shit, Mom.
Are you okay?


552
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.846
Yeah, I'm fine.

553
00:48:41.846 --> 00:48:43.152
I just needed to talk to you.

554
00:48:43.152 --> 00:48:44.458
Fuck, Marissa, what happened?

555
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.464
I... found your friend Ducky.

556
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:53.162
- What?
- Yeah.


557
00:48:55.077 --> 00:48:56.687
Yeah, he was at the food bank.

558
00:48:56.687 --> 00:49:00.517
I followed him to the train
yard down on Church Street.


559
00:49:00.517 --> 00:49:01.649
You followed him?

560
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:02.955
He snuck up

561
00:49:02.955 --> 00:49:04.391
and hit me with something.

562
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:05.653
He could have killed you, Mom.

563
00:49:05.653 --> 00:49:07.481
I know, but he talked to me.

564
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.917
Talked to you?

565
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.790
You got any whisky?

566
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.488
I'm going to go out
and look for him.


567
00:49:14.488 --> 00:49:15.663
He couldn't have gotten far.

568
00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:20.798
You sure it was him?

569
00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:22.626
I'm sure.

570
00:49:23.236 --> 00:49:24.889
Well, did he say anything?

571
00:49:24.889 --> 00:49:27.283
He said it was a guy
with a tattoo on his hand,


572
00:49:27.283 --> 00:49:28.893
that he didn't do it.

573
00:49:28.893 --> 00:49:30.156
No shit he didn't do it.

574
00:49:30.156 --> 00:49:31.461
He's not a fucking murderer.

575
00:49:31.461 --> 00:49:33.246
You expect me to believe
that the man


576
00:49:33.246 --> 00:49:35.422
who just knocked me unconscious
isn't a violent person?


577
00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:37.598
What would you do if someone
followed you like that?


578
00:49:37.598 --> 00:49:39.556
You really don't understand.

579
00:49:39.556 --> 00:49:41.341
He told Mike to meet him there.

580
00:49:41.341 --> 00:49:42.995
He set him up, Paige.

581
00:51:17.132 --> 00:51:18.394
Ducky!

582
00:51:25.923 --> 00:51:27.186
Ducky!

583
00:51:38.197 --> 00:51:39.285
Hello!

584
00:52:04.571 --> 00:52:05.876
Ducky!

585
00:54:26.147 --> 00:54:27.714
Hey, sorry, I was downstairs.

586
00:54:27.714 --> 00:54:30.804
- Can I come inside?
- Uh, yeah, okay.


587
00:54:34.286 --> 00:54:35.722
What's happening?
You alright?


588
00:54:35.722 --> 00:54:36.853
Ducky's dead.

589
00:54:38.377 --> 00:54:41.728
Uh, how do you know?

590
00:54:42.772 --> 00:54:45.340
Because I went to that old
house and I found him.


591
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.994
He killed himself.

592
00:54:49.213 --> 00:54:50.867
Fuck, okay...

593
00:54:50.867 --> 00:54:52.086
Uh...

594
00:54:52.086 --> 00:54:53.348
Oh, god.

595
00:54:55.785 --> 00:54:57.787
Alright, look, just sit down.

596
00:54:57.787 --> 00:55:00.007
I'll get you some water.
You okay?


597
00:55:00.007 --> 00:55:01.313
Yeah.

598
00:55:05.578 --> 00:55:07.014
Just have a drink.

599
00:55:07.014 --> 00:55:08.450
Take a few deep breaths.

600
00:55:12.889 --> 00:55:14.456
Fuck.

601
00:55:15.805 --> 00:55:17.503
Was anyone else there?

602
00:55:17.503 --> 00:55:18.852
No, it was just me.

603
00:55:18.852 --> 00:55:20.157
And, um...

604
00:55:21.158 --> 00:55:24.205
Yeah, I saw his body,
and then I left.


605
00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:26.294
Got it, okay.

606
00:55:26.816 --> 00:55:29.689
Uh, why didn't you call 911?

607
00:55:29.689 --> 00:55:31.734
Because I knew I wasn't
supposed to be there.


608
00:55:31.734 --> 00:55:34.041
That's why I'm here.
I knew that you could help.


609
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.869
Sure. I'm sorry.

610
00:55:35.869 --> 00:55:38.480
I'm really sorry for your loss.

611
00:55:39.089 --> 00:55:41.265
I'll get someone to go around
there right away.


612
00:55:41.265 --> 00:55:45.705
You just take it easy
and make yourself at home.


613
00:55:45.705 --> 00:55:47.924
I'm just going to be
two minutes, alright?
- Okay.


614
00:56:37.887 --> 00:56:39.062
Oh...

615
00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.217
Fuck.

616
00:57:37.294 --> 00:57:39.340
Hi, I need someone to go
to the address


617
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.778
and just check it out
right away.


618
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.913
Yeah, that's right.

619
00:57:48.305 --> 00:57:51.178
I need someone to go to 1-2-5-8
and check if possible.


620
00:57:57.793 --> 00:57:59.403
This one's personal.

621
00:59:25.533 --> 00:59:26.708
Paige?

622
01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:06.618
Paige, give me the phone.
- Get back.


623
01:00:06.618 --> 01:00:08.184
- Just give me the phone.
- No.


624
01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:09.882
- Give me the phone.
- Back the fuck off.


625
01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:11.318
- Paige...
- No.


626
01:00:18.673 --> 01:00:19.979
Listen to me.

627
01:00:19.979 --> 01:00:21.894
You don't understand
what's going on here.


628
01:00:21.894 --> 01:00:23.460
- Toby, no.
- Please.


629
01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.158
- Back up.
- I can explain.


630
01:00:25.158 --> 01:00:27.334
- Back the fuck up.
- Listen to me.


631
01:00:27.334 --> 01:00:29.075
Just give me the phone.
- Back the fuck away.


632
01:00:29.075 --> 01:00:30.467
I'm telling you.
- Back the fuck up!


633
01:00:30.467 --> 01:00:32.121
I can explain!
I can explain this. Paige!


634
01:00:32.121 --> 01:00:33.296
Just calm down!

635
01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.516
Just stop, okay!

636
01:00:35.516 --> 01:00:37.344
Calm down, give me the phone.

637
01:00:37.344 --> 01:00:39.259
Fuck you!
Get the fuck away from me!


638
01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:41.130
- Paige!
- Just back the fuck up!


639
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:42.741
Get out of my way!
Don't touch me!


640
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:44.177
- Just give me...
- Away!


641
01:00:44.177 --> 01:00:46.309
- Give me the fucking phone!
- Get the fuck off me!


642
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.920
Give me the phone!
Paige!


643
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.138
Stop!

644
01:01:06.765 --> 01:01:09.376
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

645
01:01:09.376 --> 01:01:11.378
Paige! Paige!

646
01:01:11.378 --> 01:01:13.380
Hey, hey.

647
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.730
Oh, fuck.

648
01:01:18.037 --> 01:01:19.125
Oh, fuck.

649
01:01:56.553 --> 01:01:57.685
Fuck.

650
01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:18.271
Fuck.

651
01:03:06.362 --> 01:03:07.799
Hey, I'm home.

652
01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:10.540
Gina!

653
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.194
Call an ambulance, quick!

654
01:03:12.194 --> 01:03:14.240
Gina, it's Paige,
call an ambulance!


655
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.850
She fell in the bathroom.

656
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:17.678
I think she OD'd!
She's bleeding!


657
01:03:19.288 --> 01:03:20.812
Just get an ambulance
right now!


658
01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:22.074
Okay, okay!

659
01:03:23.945 --> 01:03:25.512
Hi, um...

660
01:03:27.514 --> 01:03:29.124
Fuck, fuck!

661
01:03:33.868 --> 01:03:37.089
Toby, I think Paige
is hiding something.


662
01:03:37.089 --> 01:03:38.612
Yeah, you're right.

663
01:03:39.308 --> 01:03:41.223
She's using again
and she overdosed.


664
01:03:41.223 --> 01:03:42.616
What?

665
01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:44.705
She's on her way
to the hospital right now.


666
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.577
<i>Meet us at St. Peter's.</i>

667
01:04:33.406 --> 01:04:35.538
The forceps, please.

668
01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.154
A little more space.

669
01:04:43.982 --> 01:04:45.505
Alright.

670
01:04:49.857 --> 01:04:50.902
Alright.

671
01:04:52.381 --> 01:04:53.730
We have a flatline.

672
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:54.818
Get the crash cart.

673
01:08:33.472 --> 01:08:34.473
Hi, cat.

674
01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:36.039
There's a baby.

675
01:08:36.562 --> 01:08:37.824
Make acquaintance.

676
01:09:33.445 --> 01:09:35.186
Jesus Christ.
You scared me.


677
01:09:35.186 --> 01:09:37.100
Sorry, I let myself in.

678
01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:38.841
You okay?

679
01:09:39.494 --> 01:09:40.974
It's a nice room.

680
01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:44.760
Perfect for the little angel.

681
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.634
I've got to get her
her bottle.


682
01:09:49.374 --> 01:09:50.592
Here, come on.

683
01:09:52.594 --> 01:09:53.595
Here.

684
01:09:57.643 --> 01:09:59.340
There you go.

685
01:10:01.777 --> 01:10:02.952
Yeah.

686
01:10:07.348 --> 01:10:08.567
What's going on?

687
01:10:11.352 --> 01:10:12.875
I found something.

688
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:27.760
Marissa, I found it under
the stairs, in the basement.


689
01:10:28.543 --> 01:10:31.242
I thought it was some kind
of miracle...


690
01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:35.246
...like a gift,
left as a reminder.


691
01:10:36.203 --> 01:10:37.422
But then I saw the blood.

692
01:10:37.422 --> 01:10:40.381
- How...
- I don't know...


693
01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:45.038
I've been trying to think
of every possible reason.


694
01:10:45.038 --> 01:10:46.213
I...

695
01:11:02.403 --> 01:11:03.970
Have you asked him about it?

696
01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:04.971
No.

697
01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:08.017
I can't find the words.

698
01:11:14.676 --> 01:11:16.156
So, what are you going to do?

699
01:11:23.642 --> 01:11:25.600
I don't know what
the right thing to do is.


700
01:11:27.472 --> 01:11:29.343
I don't know if
I could do it, anyways.

701
01:11:38.613 --> 01:11:40.615
<i>I know.
I feel guilty too.</i>


702
01:11:40.615 --> 01:11:42.661
<i>I've got to leave,
but I don't think</i>


703
01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:44.880
<i>that's what you should be
thinking about right now, Mom.</i>


704
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.927
<i>He was responsible for bringing
fentanyl into the South End.</i>


705
01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:51.583
<i>Come on.
Pick up the phone... Come on.</i>


706
01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.628
<i>Ducky's not
getting away with this shit.</i>


707
01:11:54.412 --> 01:11:57.284
<i>We think he and Michael might
have been in business together.</i>


708
01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.374
<i>Maybe there was a dispute
or something.</i>


709
01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:02.594
<i>I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>


710
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:05.510
<i>There is something I want
to tell you in person.</i>


711
01:12:06.424 --> 01:12:08.164
<i>Okay, Mom...</i>

712
01:12:08.164 --> 01:12:10.428
<i>Listen, you've got
to be careful with that girl.</i>


713
01:12:10.428 --> 01:12:11.994
<i>...I love you
so much.</i>


714
01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.692
<i>Bye.</i>

715
01:12:13.692 --> 01:12:15.215
<i>You know
who called him, Paige.</i>


716
01:12:15.911 --> 01:12:17.522
<i>It was Ducky.</i>

717
01:12:17.522 --> 01:12:19.480
<i>We checked his phone.</i>

718
01:12:50.946 --> 01:12:52.165
Hi.

719
01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:54.036
She's sleeping.

720
01:12:56.648 --> 01:12:58.040
You feeling okay, Mom?

721
01:13:00.695 --> 01:13:03.176
No. Not really.

722
01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:07.920
Wow.

723
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.139
Haven't seen this thing
in years.


724
01:13:11.793 --> 01:13:14.448
This was dad's nicest suitcase.

725
01:13:15.841 --> 01:13:18.321
They covered it
in fucking stickers.


726
01:13:23.631 --> 01:13:25.198
The stuff's in there.

727
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:34.425
You think that's
what killed her?


728
01:13:41.867 --> 01:13:43.434
Yeah, it seems like it.

729
01:13:47.742 --> 01:13:49.701
They both had fentanyl in them.

730
01:13:54.053 --> 01:13:55.358
Seriously, Mom.

731
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.448
You should go see a doctor.

732
01:14:00.929 --> 01:14:02.757
Yeah... I will.

733
01:14:05.804 --> 01:14:07.632
Okay, I tried.

734
01:14:21.297 --> 01:14:22.385
Okay.

735
01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:32.532
Thank you.
I told you.


736
01:17:51.856 --> 01:17:53.422
<i>The Empire
Line running express</i>


737
01:17:53.422 --> 01:17:56.643

<i>Rhinecliff, Poughkeepsie,
Croton and Yonkers</i>


739
01:17:59.602 --> 01:18:02.954

740
01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.696
<i>Please have your tickets ready</i>

741
01:18:05.696 --> 01:18:07.785
<i>for the conductor
when he comes through.</i>


742
01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:00.218
Remember when Mike threw
that perfect game...


743
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:03.177
...until the final inning...

744
01:21:04.309 --> 01:21:06.093
...and then he gave it up
to them?


745
01:21:11.925 --> 01:21:13.753
That was just his luck.

746
01:21:16.843 --> 01:21:18.889
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.


747
01:21:21.413 --> 01:21:23.284
It was supposed to be simple.

748
01:21:25.504 --> 01:21:28.246
When Mike found out
what was in it,


749
01:21:28.246 --> 01:21:30.335
he wouldn't sell it
or give it back.


750
01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:33.294
What did he think
they were going to do?


751
01:21:34.295 --> 01:21:36.254
I guess that's my luck.

752
01:21:37.472 --> 01:21:39.997
This doesn't have anything
to do with luck.


753
01:21:41.607 --> 01:21:43.304
I'm scared, Mom.

754
01:21:51.008 --> 01:21:52.096
Me too.

755
01:22:49.718 --> 01:22:52.417
<i>My youngest son was born
to be an athlete.</i>


756
01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:55.202
<i>His older brother, Toby,
started hitting ground balls</i>


757
01:22:55.202 --> 01:22:56.682
<i>when he was two or three.</i>

758
01:22:56.682 --> 01:22:59.163
<i>The kid was good.
So was Toby.</i>


759
01:22:59.163 --> 01:23:01.382
<i>But Michael had something different...</i>

760
01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:02.818
<i>he had an arm.</i>

761
01:23:02.818 --> 01:23:04.342
Oh, just water for me.

762
01:23:05.212 --> 01:23:08.041
<i>He threw 70 miles per hour
by 14.</i>


763
01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:10.783
<i>The scouts started telling us
he had a real shot.</i>


764
01:23:11.784 --> 01:23:14.047
<i>We had no idea what kind
of damage he was doing</i>


765
01:23:14.047 --> 01:23:15.831
<i>to the shoulder
of his throwing arm.</i>


766
01:23:16.832 --> 01:23:20.749
<i>Maybe we should have
made him stop, but by 15,</i>


767
01:23:20.749 --> 01:23:22.969
<i>he was being medicated
for pain management.</i>


768
01:23:24.405 --> 01:23:27.104
<i>To say I didn't know any better
wouldn't be totally true...</i>


769
01:23:27.104 --> 01:23:28.714
Thanks.

770
01:23:28.714 --> 01:23:31.195
<i>...but I knew a kid shouldn't
be in that much pain.</i>


771
01:23:34.067 --> 01:23:36.417
<i>Then, I started seeing
his behaviour changing.</i>


772
01:23:38.724 --> 01:23:40.726
<i>Toby was a different story.</i>

773
01:23:40.726 --> 01:23:42.989
<i>He was the one we didn't have
to worry about...</i>


774
01:23:44.077 --> 01:23:46.427
<i>...the civil servant,
the ambitious one.</i>


775
01:23:47.385 --> 01:23:50.388
<i>That might be the only thing
I still recognize in him,</i>


776
01:23:50.388 --> 01:23:52.694
<i>that toxic ambition.</i>

777
01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.003
<i>As different as Mike
and Toby were,</i>


778
01:23:57.003 --> 01:23:58.570
<i>their lives stayed intertwined</i>

779
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:00.485
<i>more than they could
ever let me know.</i>


780
01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:14.238
I assume you know
the implications of this.


781
01:24:17.502 --> 01:24:19.330
I know more than anyone.

782
01:24:22.072 --> 01:24:23.508
Take a couple of days...

783
01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:26.076
...a week, whatever.

784
01:24:29.601 --> 01:24:33.909
Take that time and if then,

785
01:24:33.909 --> 01:24:38.436
you still want to publish it,
I'll have your back.


786
01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.062
It's good.

787
01:25:28.442 --> 01:25:30.183
Thanks for letting us
have her for the day.


788
01:25:31.097 --> 01:25:32.272
Can I take her?

789
01:25:34.666 --> 01:25:36.494
Hello, baby!

790
01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:39.149
Hello, baby!

791
01:25:39.845 --> 01:25:42.195
Are we going to have
some fun today?


792
01:25:42.195 --> 01:25:43.936
Oh, yeah.

793
01:25:43.936 --> 01:25:45.633
Thanks, Mom.
See you later.

Oh!

795
01:25:51.422 --> 01:25:52.814
Let's do it!

796
01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.164
Let's go have fun.

797
01:30:12.334 --> 01:30:14.424
