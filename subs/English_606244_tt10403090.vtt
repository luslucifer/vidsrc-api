1
00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.318
[cheering and applause]

2
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:21.831
[cheering and whooping]

3
00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:27.295
Thanks, folks.

4
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.596
Aww. Thanks, folks. Thanks.

5
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.139
You seem like, uh...

6
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.684
Very nice, reasonable people in
the short time I've known you, you know.


7
00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:45.730
I mean, most people want the same things.

8
00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:48.399
Dallas, Omaha, Sacramento, New York...

9
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:51.444
People everywhere want family, community,

10
00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.739
uh, security... universal values.

11
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:59.035
But if we can't agree how to get
these things after all these years,


12
00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.371
maybe we need to take some time apart,

13
00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:05.291
separate, divorce, consciously uncouple.

14
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:08.253
The Founding Fathers warned us
it would come to this.


15
00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:12.549
John Adams said the two-party system
is the greatest political evil


16
00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:14.092
under our Constitution.

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.679
George Washington cautioned
in his farewell address


18
00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:21.599
against excessive political party spirit
and geographical distinction.


19
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:23.017
Wise words.

20
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.894
They tell us what to do about it?

21
00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:26.729
They did not. They just said it,

22
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.064
then they died...

23
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.442
And now, they left
us to figure it out.

24
00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:33.611
Real geniuses.

25
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:35.864
America...

26
00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:40.118
Two parties. Still!
All these years later, two parties.


27
00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:43.288
There's 350 million people
and there's two parties.


28
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:44.747
There's 15 genders...

29
00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:46.291
and there's two parties.

30
00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:51.045
There's four bathrooms,
and there's two parties.


31
00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:54.090
And those parties are too proportionate.

32
00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:56.426
Every vote, 51-49.

33
00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.095
That's too many unhappy people
every election.


34
00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:00.930
That means, every election,

35
00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.308
our system is saying
to steak-eaters and vegans,


36
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.852
"Okay, election's over,
you gotta eat steak."


37
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.645
"Well, I don't like steak. I'm a vegan.

38
00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.607
Steak makes me physically ill.
I'm allergic."


39
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.026
"It's only every day for the next
four years. Don't worry."


40
00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:17.405
Two parties that see the country
totally differently.


41
00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:21.242
The right sees only the positive,
the left sees only the negative.


42
00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:22.285
Right sees this country

43
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:24.662
like they're at a high-school
football game in the stands.


44
00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:28.249
Cheering, "USA! USA! 
We're number one."

45
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.920
And the left sees it like
they were at an ICU unit.


46
00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:37.884
"I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do.

47
00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:42.388
America is terminally racist
and fatally patriarchal.


48
00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:44.140
It's hopeless."

49
00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:46.601
Let's be honest.
We don't even like each other.


50
00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:49.354
We don't even support each other's
businesses or economies.


51
00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:52.565
Red states hate Hollywood and the media.

52
00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.109
They won't go to the movies
or read <i>The New York Times.</i>


53
00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:56.402
And blue states

54
00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.905
won't use tobacco, dairy, or carbs.

55
00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:05.244
The red states base their vote
on Paul's Letter to the Corinthians.


56
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:09.207
Blue states base theirs
on <i>The Chomsky Reader.</i>


57
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:11.793
And nobody wants to admit

58
00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.544
it isn't really working out.

59
00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:16.422
Because it's embarrassing
to be the generation


60
00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:18.299
that lost the United States.

61
00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.301
I get it. I grew up here too.

62
00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:24.430
Lot of it was about enthusiasm,
positivity, hype.


63
00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:26.516
People would say,
"America is the greatest.


64
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.892
The greatest! The greatest."

65
00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:29.143
And you'd go, "Yeah, it's great."

66
00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:30.895
They'd go, "Why're you being so negative?

67
00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:35.191
We just said, 'The greatest.'
Why would you say 'great'?"


68
00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.403
Yeah, nobody wants to admit,
it didn't really pan out.


69
00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:41.364
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
No country really worked.


70
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:43.825
We had as good
a run as anybody else.

71
00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.122
We still have the remnants
of the greatest empire in history.


72
00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:53.042
Still have the best towels
out of any country you'll ever go to.


73
00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.421
You go to the nicest hotels in Europe,

74
00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:58.381
you're still wet after using them.

75
00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.135
You're wet, and the towels are wet.

76
00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:04.721
The towels don't work.

77
00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:08.474
Still have the greatest abundance
of ice cubes.


78
00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:12.478
Prime Minister of England
asks for ice cubes in a glass,


79
00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:13.688
they give him one ice cube.

80
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.357
Average person here,

81
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:18.776
six ice cubes, seven ice cubes.

82
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:23.031
You go out for
a drink after this show,

83
00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:24.532
they'll give you six ice cubes.

84
00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:26.451
That's the society we set up.

85
00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.620
This guy's worth more ice cubes
than the Prime Minister of England.


86
00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:35.585
We're so successful, we have a diet
called "intermittent fasting"


87
00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:37.503
where you go to bed hungry.

88
00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:39.839
I mean, in the...

89
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:43.885
History of civilization,

90
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:47.055
everyone's primal goal,
not to go to bed hungry.


91
00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:48.639
And we get to the point,
people walk up to you,


92
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.516
"How are you doing?" "I'm starving."

93
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.060
"Congratulations."

94
00:04:54.604 --> 00:04:57.023
We succeeded. We're badass.

95
00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.483
If there's a World War right now,

96
00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.985
we have to worry about
maybe, two countries,


97
00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.111
China and Russia.

98
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:05.156
Out of 190 countries, two.

99
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.409
Uruguay has to be nice to everybody.

100
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:12.455
They go to the
UN Security Council meetings,


101
00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:14.374
they bump into Luxembourg
coming out of the bathroom,


102
00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:16.918
they're both going, "Excuse me."
"Excuse me. I didn't see you."


103
00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:20.338
Meanwhile, our President
can go, "Up yours!"


104
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.883
Everybody's like, "Oh, it's America.
You know how they get. They're crazy."


105
00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:25.718
'Cause they know we can really hurt them.

106
00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:28.346
You know, while other
countries talk tough,


107
00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:30.223
but they can't get off the barstool.

108
00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:34.060
So, the problem is not out there.
The problem is in here.


109
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:36.395
We have met the enemy. It is us.

110
00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.190
And now, we're at
risk of a civil war.

111
00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:41.859
And you don't want to see a civil war
in this country.


112
00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:44.320
This country is not built
for another civil war.


113
00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:46.072
It's gonna be the first time in history

114
00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:48.199
that you see fat refugees.

115
00:05:53.037 --> 00:05:55.665
That's not gonna be a good look, really.

116
00:05:55.748 --> 00:05:58.960
Refugees in jorts and flip-flops

117
00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:01.003
and Dunder Mifflin T-shirts,

118
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.133
pulling coolers
towards the Canadian border.


119
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.052
It's gonna look like a giant cattle drive.

120
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.306
There's nothing glamorous...
Fifty years from now,


121
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.518
kids are in history class
reading about the Battle of Six Flags.


122
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:20.898
The Siege of Dave & Buster's.

123
00:06:22.984 --> 00:06:25.862
The problem with war,
it makes idiocy contagious.


124
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.906
You wind up with mass hysteria,
like this country right now.


125
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.493
Half this country swears
there's a Muslim invasion, right now,


126
00:06:32.577 --> 00:06:34.871
and the other half swears
there's a Nazi invasion.


127
00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:37.290
That's why this country's
built on compromise.


128
00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:41.377
'Cause the Founding Fathers understood
most people are mentally ill.


129
00:06:44.714 --> 00:06:47.758
And the problem with compromise,
nobody ever compromises.


130
00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:50.761
Our system has been
in gridlock for 40 years


131
00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:52.889
and no one seems alarmed by this.

132
00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:55.933
It's like our system's like,
you're sitting in your car in traffic


133
00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.351
for 40 years.

134
00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:01.522
You're honking your horn,
your battery's dead,


135
00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:04.108
you're out of gas,
you've pissed your pants.


136
00:07:04.483 --> 00:07:05.985
You're cursing, "I'm gonna kill everybody!

137
00:07:06.068 --> 00:07:07.987
I'll kill... I'll kill myself
and everybody else."


138
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.114
And the person next to you goes,
"Yeah, but at least you get to say that.


139
00:07:10.198 --> 00:07:11.532
That's the beauty of this country."

140
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.413
And let's remember,
war is more likely to start


141
00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:19.874
when extremists start to rise to the top.

142
00:07:19.957 --> 00:07:23.085
Because extremists are who you want
in charge during a war.


143
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.296
You don't want moderate generals.

144
00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:27.423
Who needs a moderate general?

145
00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:30.718
You don't want a general
giving that pre-battle speech,


146
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.430
"Okay, men, we're gonna descend that hill
and destroy that village.


147
00:07:34.514 --> 00:07:38.309
Remember something. Those people
down there are basically just like us...


148
00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.560
deep down.

149
00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.523
It's a different culture.
Now, let's go kill 'em."


150
00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:47.485
You don't want philosophers.
You want generals.


151
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:49.320
"They're bad. We're good."

152
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:52.823
And we're not gonna be able
to stop war once it starts.


153
00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:56.244
No one in history has figured out
how to stop a war.


154
00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:58.663
Nobody's even figured out
how to stop bar fights.


155
00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:00.623
How are we gonna stop wars?

156
00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:03.334
And bars are the last place
there should ever be a fight.


157
00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:05.127
Bars are the happiest place on Earth.

158
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:07.004
It's like Disneyland for adults.

159
00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:09.257
You're not at work anymore.

160
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.468
You're with friends.
There's liquor, music, attractive people,


161
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:13.803
and there's still violence.

162
00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:17.848
Work is where you would've expected
to have seen violence, is all.


163
00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:21.686
'Cause you're at work.

164
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.187
9:30, Tuesday morning,

165
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:25.815
should be the most violent place
on the planet.


166
00:08:32.863 --> 00:08:35.658
"Don't go near the copier.
It's a bucket of blood."


167
00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:41.080
So, how did all this happen
to such a great empire?


168
00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:43.082
Well, for one thing, we wanted more.

169
00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:44.542
That was our mission statement.

170
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.752
"Bigger, better, faster, more."

171
00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:50.047
Started out with 13 colonies
and now we're at 50 states.


172
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:51.841
What was wrong with 13 colonies?

173
00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:54.051
Thirteen seems like a lot.

174
00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:56.554
We were already bigger
than England and France.


175
00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:57.847
But we got greedy.

176
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:59.890
We didn't take the hint from God.

177
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:03.769
God put giant mountain ranges
and rivers all over the place.


178
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.397
That was to indicate different countries.

179
00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:11.777
Europe, same size as us, basically.
Bunch of different countries.


180
00:09:11.861 --> 00:09:13.529
'Cause they understood,

181
00:09:13.613 --> 00:09:16.866
every 700 miles,
people have a different personality.


182
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.914
I mean, do you really think Hungary
and Scotland have less in common


183
00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:25.875
than Utah and New Jersey?

184
00:09:32.048 --> 00:09:34.091
And the glue that was
gonna keep us all together,


185
00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.677
keep us from tribalism, civil war...

186
00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:38.262
All that Constitution stuff,

187
00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:41.599
democracy, equality, free speech.

188
00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:44.852
"Free speech."
Boy, did we take that one too far.


189
00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:47.647
Nobody ever shuts up in this country.

190
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:51.275
And for a country based on free speech,
I gotta say,


191
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.819
haven't heard a lot of great speeches
come out of here.


192
00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:58.324
If you can name 20 great speeches
since our country began,


193
00:09:58.407 --> 00:09:59.575
I'm wrong, but you can't.

194
00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:00.868
There's been like five.

195
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:02.745
The Martin Luther King speech,

196
00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:04.497
the John F. Kennedy speech,

197
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.499
and the next three were
end-of-the-season monologues


198
00:10:06.582 --> 00:10:08.042
on <i>The Bachelor...</i>

199
00:10:12.588 --> 00:10:14.090
Where the guy gives
the speech to the girl.


200
00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:17.009
He's like, "With you,
I feel like I can be me,


201
00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:18.761
but..."

202
00:10:21.138 --> 00:10:22.473
[sighs] "But with her,

203
00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:25.434
I feel like I can be the man
I'm supposed to be someday.


204
00:10:27.478 --> 00:10:28.604
And...

205
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.273
I did...

206
00:10:34.694 --> 00:10:37.154
And I did put myself out there,

207
00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:39.198
and I do see myself
with a wife and children


208
00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:41.117
and a family someday,

209
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.827
and it would only be with you.

210
00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:45.996
But you're so perfect that that scares me.

211
00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:50.960
That's why I'm sending you home,

212
00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:54.714
and I'm giving...

213
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.591
I'm giving a rose to her."

214
00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:01.429
Yeah, free speech did nothing,
but it gave everybody an opinion.


215
00:11:01.512 --> 00:11:03.681
And social media ruined opinion.

216
00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:06.851
Because free speech
was never meant to go electric.


217
00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:08.561
That was an acoustic art.

218
00:11:08.644 --> 00:11:11.939
It was meant to be spoken
on top of a tree stump


219
00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:13.482
in front of seven other farmers,

220
00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.067
or maybe in a general store,

221
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:17.236
sitting outside on the porch
in a rocking chair.


222
00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:20.364
If somebody told you, even 15 years ago,

223
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:21.740
"We have this idea

224
00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:24.952
where everybody is gonna be able
to give their innermost thoughts,


225
00:11:25.035 --> 00:11:27.037
all day, every day,

226
00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:30.374
minute-by-minute updates
to the entire planet."


227
00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:34.128
You would say, "Oh, God, no.
Please don't do that."


228
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.756
That's gonna...

229
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.222
That's gonna lead to
a breakdown of communication,


230
00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:47.349
accusation, ridicule, and mob rule.

231
00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:50.436
Because social media sounds like
the ultimate democracy.


232
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:53.481
A civil exchange of ideas
among all people equally.


233
00:11:53.564 --> 00:11:55.941
Nobody knew it was gonna
turn into drunks at a wedding,


234
00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:58.360
grabbing the microphone
out of the best man's hand.


235
00:11:59.445 --> 00:12:01.906
It's like, "Hold on.
I wanna say something right now."


236
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.032
"Who is that?"

237
00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:05.284
"I don't know. He's not supposed
to be up there. It's a...


238
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:08.287
He's the date of some girl
who works with the bride. Yeah."


239
00:12:09.747 --> 00:12:11.457
Remember when the Internet started,

240
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.543
we were all positive soccer moms.

241
00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:17.004
Everybody was posting
pictures of unicorns,


242
00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:18.589
sunsets, rainbows,

243
00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:20.216
inspirational quotes.

244
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.801
"Make yesterday today's tomorrow."

245
00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:31.936
Yeah. It's corny, but look at it now.

246
00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:33.145
"Stay in your lane."

247
00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:34.897
"Keep my name out of your mouth."

248
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.649
"Die in a fire."

249
00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.903
And I'm old, you know. 
I grew up offline.

250
00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:42.988
And in those days,

251
00:12:43.072 --> 00:12:45.282
if you wanted to have
a political debate with somebody,


252
00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:46.909
you couldn't do it in your underwear.

253
00:12:49.828 --> 00:12:52.122
You had to get dressed,
go down to the local bar,


254
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.457
pick up the newspaper,

255
00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:55.417
find somebody you knew
disagreed with you politically.


256
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:57.461
You'd be like, "You like this, don't you?"

257
00:12:59.088 --> 00:13:01.632
Guy goes, "Matter of fact, I do.
What's your problem?"


258
00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:02.716
And then you'd have a debate

259
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.177
but it was friends, family,
people you knew from the neighborhood.


260
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:06.887
So the bar itself was Facebook.

261
00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:11.809
And Twitter was all the strangers
doing coke in the bathroom together.


262
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.440
Speaking in short bursts
of under 280 characters.


263
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.111
Paranoid like, "Yeah,
why are you following me, huh?


264
00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.072
Trying to send me a message?
I'll block you."


265
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.076
Reddit was the regulars at the bar
that were there too often


266
00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:31.787
so they'd notice things
no one should ever notice.


267
00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:34.957
Just watching all the time.

268
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.792
"Man, did you change
the taps on the IPA?"

269
00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.544
"Okay, that's enough out of you."

270
00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:42.798
And the troll was the guy
in the corner, asleep,


271
00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:45.050
who'd just lift his head up
every three hours and go,


272
00:13:45.134 --> 00:13:46.552
"Everybody here can kiss my ass."

273
00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:47.970
You're like, "All right.

274
00:13:49.388 --> 00:13:50.472
That's enough out of you.

275
00:13:50.556 --> 00:13:52.224
We're gonna unfriend you
if you keep it up."


276
00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:55.144
Yeah. The other thing social media did,

277
00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:58.314
it created sub-categories
of personalities.


278
00:13:58.689 --> 00:14:00.190
Messiah people.

279
00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:03.485
There's people that have
a savior complex on social media.


280
00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:04.778
Which, I get it.

281
00:14:04.862 --> 00:14:06.739
If you have more than 12 followers,

282
00:14:06.822 --> 00:14:10.034
technically, you're doing better
than Jesus ever did.


283
00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:15.873
That's what they're probably thinking.

284
00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.917
"Hey, Jesus had 12, I have 23.

285
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.254
I should probably weigh in
on some of the matters of the day."


286
00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.091
The grandiosity, the self-importance,

287
00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:27.551
thumbs up, thumbs down...

288
00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.887
We created a nation of Roman emperors.

289
00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:34.934
Also, people that think
because they're famous,


290
00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:36.518
that must mean they're intelligent.

291
00:14:37.728 --> 00:14:39.271
You have famous people

292
00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.857
that have spent every day
of the last five years online,


293
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:45.527
arguing with Mississippi teenagers
over the Affordable Care Act.


294
00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:51.825
Athletes giving civics lessons

295
00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:53.744
to electricians from Topeka.

296
00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:57.998
Filmmakers on the red carpet
scolding sheet-metal workers.


297
00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.583
Like the guy's supposed to go,

298
00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:00.751
"I better listen to him.

299
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:04.046
He directed a superhero movie
I kind of liked three years ago."


300
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.801
I saw a famous actor tweeting
from the Mediterranean,


301
00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:11.095
"Here on vacation with my son in Italy.

302
00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:13.055
Just want to remind people back home

303
00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:15.307
to get out next week
and vote for 3rd Alderman,


304
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:17.643
14th district in Southwest Indiana."

305
00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:20.187
Does he not know

306
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.772
he's lecturing a guy

307
00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:24.108
in the 14th district in Southwest Indiana

308
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.651
who's eating a Hungry
-Man dinner

309
00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:27.528
on an engine block in the living room?

310
00:15:28.988 --> 00:15:30.572
For his son's birthday,
he has to convince him


311
00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:32.992
his old welding helmet
is an Iron Man mask.


312
00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:34.994
He has no vacation.

313
00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:37.746
Vacation... He lets the kids
come down to the job site


314
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.623
and play with the blasting caps

315
00:15:39.832 --> 00:15:42.876
while his wife's trying to get a suntan
laying on a paving shovel.


316
00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:46.213
You don't drive up to people
in your Lamborghini,


317
00:15:46.296 --> 00:15:48.382
splash 'em with mud.
When they go, "What'd you do that for?"


318
00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:50.426
You go, "I'm speaking truth to power."

319
00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:54.638
But people don't care
what I'm saying right now.


320
00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:56.515
Everybody wants to control other people.

321
00:15:56.598 --> 00:15:59.309
What they say, what they think. Everybody.

322
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.895
Even people that you'd go to see

323
00:16:01.979 --> 00:16:04.565
with the express purpose
of having a different opinion.


324
00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:07.359
Like a comedian, hypothetically.

325
00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:12.614
Yes, a lot of people are focused
on comedians' language.


326
00:16:12.698 --> 00:16:15.826
Yeah, it's been really fun
watching comedy become "woke"


327
00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:17.161
and...

328
00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:18.328
[applause]

329
00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:19.913
Because... Yeah.

330
00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:23.333
No, look.

331
00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:24.877
Bloggers tell me all the time. They say,

332
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.295
"As a comedian, don't you realize

333
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:28.630
you're supposed to evolve
with your audience?"


334
00:16:28.714 --> 00:16:31.633
And that is true.
That's actually why I got into comedy.


335
00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:35.262
So I could march in lockstep
with society's contemporary convention.


336
00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:36.889
[cheering and applause]

337
00:16:36.972 --> 00:16:38.015
Anyway...

338
00:16:43.395 --> 00:16:45.647
I wanted to conform to the status quo.

339
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.108
They asked me when
I was a little kid,

340
00:16:48.192 --> 00:16:49.943
"Colin, what do you wanna be
when you grow up?" I said,


341
00:16:50.027 --> 00:16:52.112
"I don't care.
As long as I get to reinforce


342
00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:53.864
mainstream opinion."

343
00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.243
People said, "You sound like
you'd be a good comedian."


344
00:17:00.412 --> 00:17:02.289
You know, all this focus on language

345
00:17:02.372 --> 00:17:05.459
makes me realize we need
a natural disaster fast,


346
00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:07.044
just to give people a perspective.

347
00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:09.713
Do you think during the plague,
people are covered with boils,


348
00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:11.924
and they're like,
"I'm uncomfortable with the phrase


349
00:17:12.007 --> 00:17:13.884
'throw out your dead,' first of all.

350
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.678
It's marginalizing.
It's a little bit demonizing."


351
00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:20.390
The other thing free speech gave
is everybody's a critic.


352
00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:22.226
Everybody knows what's wrong.

353
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:24.311
Even if you don't have a solution,
it doesn't matter.


354
00:17:24.394 --> 00:17:25.604
You get to give your opinion.

355
00:17:25.687 --> 00:17:29.024
Ask anybody what's wrong
with this country, they know. Geniuses.


356
00:17:29.108 --> 00:17:31.401
"I'll tell you the problem
with this country. These politicians."


357
00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:34.154
Everybody's like,
"Oh, there's a fresh take." You know.


358
00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:37.324
They're like,
"No, it's these corporations."


359
00:17:37.407 --> 00:17:40.244
"It's the insurance companies."
"It's the drug companies."


360
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:43.247
"It's the legal system."
"It's the justice system."


361
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.249
"It's the unions." "It's the immigrants."

362
00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:46.542
"It's the American people."

363
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.502
And finally, the big-picture visionary.

364
00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:52.339
"Problem with this country
is it's a corrupt, decaying,


365
00:17:52.422 --> 00:17:55.551
systemically sexist, racist,
homophobic, xenophobic,


366
00:17:55.634 --> 00:17:57.136
genocidal hellhole."

367
00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:58.220
Like, "That sounds terrible.

368
00:17:58.303 --> 00:17:59.972
You gotta get out of there fast.
You gotta leave."


369
00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:02.891
Like, "Why would I leave?
It's the greatest country in the world."


370
00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:08.272
Yeah. So, free speech was a stupid idea

371
00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:09.815
'cause we're not
smart enough to handle that.


372
00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:12.067
It should've been Free Speech
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.


373
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:13.485
Say whatever you want.

374
00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:16.864
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
facial expressions only.


375
00:18:18.282 --> 00:18:20.909
Sunday, you think about what
you're gonna say that week.


376
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.997
What else? Law.

377
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.500
We're not a nation of men.
We're a nation of laws, right?


378
00:18:28.584 --> 00:18:32.838
And, uh, people that enforce those laws
are called "representatives."


379
00:18:32.921 --> 00:18:34.673
That was the genius
of the Founding Fathers.


380
00:18:34.756 --> 00:18:37.509
They said, "Middleman."
That's what they came up with.


381
00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:39.219
Politicians, lawyers, cops.

382
00:18:39.303 --> 00:18:41.054
People you can focus your anger on,

383
00:18:41.138 --> 00:18:42.514
so you don't end up chasing each other

384
00:18:42.598 --> 00:18:44.892
around the town squares
with hammers all day.


385
00:18:45.475 --> 00:18:48.270
Because if there was no real estate agent,

386
00:18:48.353 --> 00:18:50.189
the old days, no middleman,

387
00:18:50.272 --> 00:18:52.149
people would just walk up,
knock on your door,


388
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.818
"Hey, what's up.
I like your house. I wanna live here."


389
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:57.529
"Well, I live here. I like it."

390
00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:59.448
"Do you like it
enough to die for it?

391
00:18:59.531 --> 00:19:02.034
'Cause that's where this is going,
you understand that?"


392
00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:06.496
You'd have to go, "Excuse me."
Go in the back,


393
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.208
get a sharpened object,
come out and slice their head off.


394
00:19:09.291 --> 00:19:11.293
Put it on a stake outside your house.

395
00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:13.503
That was to tell everybody,
"Not for sale."


396
00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:17.799
Instead, you got the middleman.

397
00:19:18.175 --> 00:19:20.761
Real estate agent who goes, "You don't
even need to talk to each other.


398
00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:22.054
You never meet.

399
00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:23.889
It's just, here's the law,
here's the contract,


400
00:19:23.972 --> 00:19:25.057
here's the way we do it."

401
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.308
But we even took that too far.

402
00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:29.519
Now, we just use it
to blame the middleman.


403
00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.730
Like politicians. 
Perfect example.

404
00:19:31.813 --> 00:19:34.608
People go, "These politicians
are corrupt." Why?


405
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:38.528
"Because they do favors for people
that gave them money to get elected."


406
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.114
First of all, that sounds
like an ethical person to me.


407
00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:42.407
A corr...

408
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.205
A corrupt person takes your money
and doesn't do you a favor.


409
00:19:49.998 --> 00:19:51.625
It's not their fault
the system is set up

410
00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:53.919
where all representatives
have to go, hat in hand,


411
00:19:54.002 --> 00:19:55.420
to the advertising executive.

412
00:19:55.504 --> 00:19:57.547
"Can I do a commercial tonight?
Thirty seconds?"


413
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.591
Guy's like, "$100,000."

414
00:20:00.008 --> 00:20:02.344
"But you don't understand.
This is not for a product.


415
00:20:02.427 --> 00:20:05.389
This is for the election.
The foundation of our democracy."


416
00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:06.515
And the advertising agent's like,

417
00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:09.184
"And you don't understand,
this is the season finale


418
00:20:09.268 --> 00:20:10.519
of <i>Young Sheldon."</i>

419
00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:14.314
Yeah.

420
00:20:15.357 --> 00:20:18.568
The problem with our system of law
is that it's not even our system.


421
00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:20.237
It's based on Roman law.

422
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.408
That system best known
for killing Jesus Christ.


423
00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:26.868
I'd say we got
off on the wrong foot.

424
00:20:28.537 --> 00:20:31.415
The first democratic vote
I ever heard of, Pontius Pilate.


425
00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:34.167
The Roman governor
brings out Barabbas and Jesus,


426
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:36.586
and goes, "We're stepping out of this.
It's up to you.


427
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.506
Only you people decide
who lives, who dies.


428
00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:41.925
Got Barabbas. You've seen him around town.

429
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.260
He murders people.

430
00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.012
There's nothing else
you would know him from,


431
00:20:45.095 --> 00:20:46.555
except murdering people.

432
00:20:48.724 --> 00:20:51.601
We got this new guy, Jesus.
He just got here Monday.


433
00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:52.853
He's...

434
00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:56.440
We think he's a false prophet,
but it's, you know...


435
00:20:56.523 --> 00:20:59.651
We get a lot of those.
It's basically a misdemeanor in Judaea."


436
00:21:00.902 --> 00:21:02.738
And Jesus lost... 
He didn't lose,

437
00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:04.281
Jesus got swept.

438
00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:06.366
And we kept voting that way.

439
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.871
Why? Why would the Founding Fathers
keep a system of law


440
00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:12.956
where the son of God
could lose to a serial killer?


441
00:21:14.916 --> 00:21:16.043
Why? Because they felt

442
00:21:16.126 --> 00:21:19.004
they could neutralize
the mob rule aspect of democracy


443
00:21:19.087 --> 00:21:20.339
with representatives.

444
00:21:20.422 --> 00:21:22.549
So, when you go outside tonight,

445
00:21:22.632 --> 00:21:25.218
if there's somebody naked,
waving a machete around,


446
00:21:25.302 --> 00:21:27.304
which I'm sure you've all seen
a couple of times...


447
00:21:28.096 --> 00:21:29.598
You don't think like a mob, like,

448
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:32.642
"Let's stone him to death.
Burn him alive like the good old days."


449
00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.519
You think, representative.

450
00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.981
Middleman. "Somebody should call a cop."

451
00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:39.858
Because in a representative democracy,

452
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:42.986
there's a guy with a mustache
that passed the civil service test.


453
00:21:44.196 --> 00:21:46.156
He's supposed to show up and go,
"What do you want me to do?"


454
00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:47.574
And you go, "Get in the middle."

455
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.414
And there were other systems
of law before ours too,


456
00:21:54.498 --> 00:21:55.582
that worked well.

457
00:21:55.665 --> 00:21:58.627
Duels, vendettas, vigilante justice.

458
00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:01.588
Nobody sued for slander
in the days of duels.


459
00:22:02.172 --> 00:22:04.132
You'd take care of it yourself.
You'd walk up,


460
00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:07.094
"I heard you said the Duke of Gloucester
was a scoundrel."


461
00:22:09.805 --> 00:22:11.848
And the guy's like, "Yeah, so what?"

462
00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:15.227
"So, I'm the Duke of Gloucester.
That's 'so what.'


463
00:22:16.103 --> 00:22:19.272
En garde, you slithering rat-catcher."
You know.


464
00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:24.152
Vendetta. In the days of vendetta...

465
00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:26.863
Vendetta... Some other family would come

466
00:22:26.947 --> 00:22:29.533
and start grazing
their animals on your land,


467
00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:31.785
which is kind of... 
That's an insult.

468
00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:34.996
That's like if somebody puts their jacket
on the back of your seat.


469
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.415
That's an intrusion on your territory.

470
00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:39.167
So, they'd go to the elders,
"What do we do?


471
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:41.545
They're grazing animals on our land.
Do we kill them?"


472
00:22:41.628 --> 00:22:43.338
He's like, "You don't kill them.
You let them...


473
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:44.840
They're poor, like us.

474
00:22:44.923 --> 00:22:46.508
They got four yaks. 
We have four yaks.

475
00:22:46.591 --> 00:22:49.511
Let them grow.
Let them have family. Let them graze.


476
00:22:49.594 --> 00:22:53.223
Let them be prosperous.
Kids, grandkids, great-grandkids.


477
00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:55.350
Then when they're
at the pinnacle of their success,


478
00:22:55.433 --> 00:22:56.643
then you kill them."

479
00:22:58.103 --> 00:22:59.646
That's a vendetta.

480
00:23:01.356 --> 00:23:03.608
So, if somebody puts their jacket
on the back of your seat


481
00:23:03.692 --> 00:23:05.360
at this show,
you're not gonna do anything.


482
00:23:05.443 --> 00:23:07.237
But wait till you're at <i>Hamilton.</i>

483
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:09.239
Then, it might...

484
00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:11.533
Then, it might actually mean something.

485
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.536
And vigilante justice, which was...

486
00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:16.079
Say what you want about vigilante justice,

487
00:23:16.163 --> 00:23:18.748
things like sexual harassment
never happened.


488
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:20.542
They never got off the ground.

489
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:23.378
'Cause the girl
would come home crying, "Papa!"


490
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:24.713
"What's the matter, daughter?"

491
00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:28.300
"My supervisor, Carl,
is saying disgusting things to me."


492
00:23:28.383 --> 00:23:31.052
He's like, "Really? Get your brothers.
Get your cousins."


493
00:23:33.638 --> 00:23:35.432
Go down there. "Are you Carl?"

494
00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:38.351
"Yeah." Beat him to death
with shovels. Yeah.


495
00:23:40.896 --> 00:23:42.731
It worked, but it was too primitive
for our taste.


496
00:23:42.814 --> 00:23:44.482
We replaced it with the Constitution.

497
00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:47.152
The biggest middleman of all, by the way.

498
00:23:47.485 --> 00:23:49.905
But we even took the Constitution too far,

499
00:23:49.988 --> 00:23:52.949
where now it serves the guilty
more than the victim


500
00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:54.201
'cause of the red tape.

501
00:23:54.284 --> 00:23:56.661
'Cause now a girl comes home,
she's crying.


502
00:23:56.745 --> 00:23:58.747
She's talking to the Constitution,
not her father.


503
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.374
She's like, "My supervisor, Carl,
says disgusting--"


504
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:04.294
"Well, that's freedom of speech.
'Says' is a tricky area."


505
00:24:05.962 --> 00:24:07.881
"Yeah, but he sits
too close to me at work--"


506
00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:09.466
"Eh, freedom of assembly."

507
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:14.221
"But he's asked me out like 30 times.
I turn him down, he won't stop--"


508
00:24:14.304 --> 00:24:15.722
"Right to petition."

509
00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:21.561
And then, First Amendment,
the Bill of Rights, led to what?


510
00:24:21.645 --> 00:24:23.772
Sodom and Gomorrah.
That's what rights always lead to.


511
00:24:23.855 --> 00:24:27.192
We are literally swiping
other human beings, right?


512
00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:30.028
People are swiping
other human beings every day.


513
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.031
That's... If you showed
Tinder to Caligula...


514
00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:36.451
He would've gone,
"Let me get this straight.


515
00:24:36.534 --> 00:24:38.954
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
This is what you...


516
00:24:39.454 --> 00:24:42.457
Geez, I mean, I like to have a good time,
but this is really too much."


517
00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:46.127
We're gonna have to pull back.

518
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:49.547
We're gonna go back to dating,
what dating was before electricity.


519
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:52.300
No sex. That's how this country got built.

520
00:24:52.384 --> 00:24:53.385
Guys show up...

521
00:24:53.468 --> 00:24:56.346
Next generation,
young guys are gonna show up at the door.


522
00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:59.391
Bow hello to the family,
like the old days.


523
00:24:59.474 --> 00:25:01.101
First date was the same date every time,

524
00:25:01.268 --> 00:25:02.686
a walk on a path.

525
00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:06.231
Just take a nice walk on a path.

526
00:25:06.523 --> 00:25:09.067
Second date, things start
to heat up a little bit.


527
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.027
You push her on
a swing for 20 minutes.

528
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.781
A swing was a nice time back then.

529
00:25:15.448 --> 00:25:18.034
A swing is still, actually, a nice time.
That's what's embarrassing.


530
00:25:18.118 --> 00:25:19.703
You ever go on a swing
accidentally as an adult,


531
00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:22.789
and you start to enjoy yourself?
You feel embarrassment.


532
00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:25.792
But that's how this country was built.
Nobody had sex.


533
00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:28.461
Through the 1940s.
You watch those 1940s movies,


534
00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:30.005
the guy's trying to get a kiss.

535
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.258
That's... One kiss!
That's the plot of the whole movie.


536
00:25:35.135 --> 00:25:37.012
It's World War II.
He's got a sailor outfit on.


537
00:25:37.095 --> 00:25:39.889
"Come on, doll, give me a kiss.
I'm crazy about you.


538
00:25:40.682 --> 00:25:43.143
I'm shipping out tomorrow."
He's always shipping out tomorrow.


539
00:25:45.353 --> 00:25:46.479
And the girl's like, "No," you know.

540
00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:48.940
He's got 500 wingmen
behind him on the destroyer.


541
00:25:49.024 --> 00:25:50.483
And, like, they're trying to
back him up. Like...


542
00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:53.320
[singing] <i>♪ Give him a kiss, honey
Give him a kiss, baby ♪</i>


543
00:25:53.403 --> 00:25:55.280
<i>♪ Give him a kiss, baby ♪</i>

544
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.329
You know, he tries to tell her,
"This is war. This is real, hon.


545
00:26:02.412 --> 00:26:04.622
We're going to Normandy beach
on this thing tomorrow.


546
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:07.667
Can I get one kiss?
I got a bad feeling about this, you know."


547
00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:12.172
She'd say, "Honeymoon."
That's when you got the first kiss.


548
00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:13.923
Honeymoon.
That's the first time you had sex.


549
00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:15.175
Even when I was a kid,

550
00:26:15.258 --> 00:26:18.386
Johnny Carson would get on TV
and make jokes about the honeymoon,


551
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.097
all the old people would fall out
of their chairs laughing


552
00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:23.099
'cause that was the dirtiest joke
you could say.


553
00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:25.143
That's the first time you had sex.

554
00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:26.311
And Johnny'd be out there, like...

555
00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:29.647
[imitates Carson] "Then they went
on their honeymoon." You know.


556
00:26:30.565 --> 00:26:31.691
And all the old ladies would be like,

557
00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:34.319
"Oh, Johnny, you are too much!
I swear, you are too much."


558
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.032
Like, "They didn't leave the room
for three days." "Johnny!"


559
00:26:40.825 --> 00:26:41.951
Now, people go on their honeymoon,

560
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:44.120
they've had sex with each other
hundreds of times.


561
00:26:44.204 --> 00:26:45.705
Nothing special happening.

562
00:26:45.997 --> 00:26:49.209
Like, "Hey, it's our honeymoon.
You wanna have sex?"


563
00:26:49.292 --> 00:26:51.378
"What about the paddleboard rental, huh?

564
00:26:56.383 --> 00:26:57.717
What is your problem?

565
00:26:58.468 --> 00:27:00.845
I don't wanna have sex with you.
This is our honeymoon!


566
00:27:02.097 --> 00:27:04.224
We're supposed to be doing things
different than we do back home,


567
00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:05.767
making memories.

568
00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:08.645
There's parasailing, a volcano tour.

569
00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:11.064
I've had sex with you half my life.

570
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.733
I've never been on a zip-line."

571
00:27:17.987 --> 00:27:20.865
Yeah, there once was
a kinder, gentler time.


572
00:27:20.949 --> 00:27:23.410
Even the music back then, the '40s music,

573
00:27:23.493 --> 00:27:26.246
it wasn't, like, so overtly sexual.

574
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:27.914
Nobody mentioned any body...

575
00:27:27.997 --> 00:27:30.792
It was... Lower your expectations.
You know what I mean?


576
00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:32.961
It's like... No "tits, ass."

577
00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:34.337
"Your eyes."

578
00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:37.382
"Your lips." [sighs]

579
00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:39.050
"The stars."

580
00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:41.761
"The way you wear your hat." You know.

581
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.806
Lower expectat--

582
00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:47.142
Guy would get an erection
just on the idea


583
00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:49.644
of the moon bouncing off your hair.

584
00:27:55.316 --> 00:27:57.277
And I know some people will say,
"No, it was healthy


585
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.988
that we started having pre-marital sex
in the 1960s."


586
00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:01.281
No, it wasn't.

587
00:28:01.364 --> 00:28:03.450
If it was, then why a year later...

588
00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:05.160
It should've been novelty enough...

589
00:28:05.243 --> 00:28:08.329
Pre-marital missionary position
should've kept us going for 80 years,


590
00:28:08.413 --> 00:28:10.165
but a year later, people were bored.

591
00:28:10.248 --> 00:28:12.917
"Let's have doggy style."
"Why don't you get on top?"


592
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:14.836
Three-way, oral, anal.

593
00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:16.921
And now, do you even recognize sex?

594
00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:19.299
Smack you in the face. "Excuse me."

595
00:28:20.675 --> 00:28:21.843
Pull your hair.

596
00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:23.470
Spit.

597
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.305
Choke hold.

598
00:28:26.014 --> 00:28:28.558
When I was growing up, sex would end
'cause the girl would go, "I came."


599
00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:29.893
Now, they tap out.

600
00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:40.904
Because I grew up
in the 1970s, different--


601
00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:42.822
1970s, they thought we were wild.

602
00:28:42.906 --> 00:28:46.159
We were like innocent children
compared to today.


603
00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:48.953
If one of our friends
had ever walked up to us


604
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.622
with a Polaroid in his hands

605
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.874
and we were like, "What's that?"
He's like, "It's a...


606
00:28:52.957 --> 00:28:54.459
A picture of my penis."

607
00:28:59.964 --> 00:29:02.258
"Why do you have that?
Did the doctor take that?"


608
00:29:06.387 --> 00:29:08.223
He's like, "No, 
I took it myself."

609
00:29:11.684 --> 00:29:13.394
"Are you bringing it to the doctor?"

610
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:16.940
"No. I was gonna show
that girl over there."


611
00:29:21.903 --> 00:29:23.530
"Why would you do that?"

612
00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:26.950
He's like, "'Cause I like her."

613
00:29:29.744 --> 00:29:31.746
We would've had to beat him to death.

614
00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:34.749
'Cause that would be the sign
of a serial killer.


615
00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:38.586
I guarantee it was illegal

616
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.381
to have a picture of your penis,
and to hand it to another person


617
00:29:41.464 --> 00:29:44.509
in this country till like 2011
or something.


618
00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:48.638
Still probably in the FBI profile
of a serial killer.


619
00:29:48.721 --> 00:29:51.099
"Starts fires when they're little kids.

620
00:29:51.266 --> 00:29:52.433
Cruel to animals.

621
00:29:52.517 --> 00:29:54.853
Has picture of pretty average penis,

622
00:29:54.936 --> 00:29:56.396
thinks it's a great ice-breaker."

623
00:29:58.106 --> 00:30:01.442
Sex. Another thing we just took too far.

624
00:30:01.526 --> 00:30:04.320
Not all of us, obviously.
You know who you are.


625
00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:08.825
And...

626
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:11.703
You know what you've done.

627
00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:16.249
What's left? Democracy. Equality.

628
00:30:16.332 --> 00:30:18.585
"Equality," another one
of those great ideas,


629
00:30:18.668 --> 00:30:20.378
turned out to be a really bad move.

630
00:30:20.461 --> 00:30:24.007
"Equal under the law" means
everybody is equal under the law.


631
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.175
That means it protects assholes.

632
00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:28.720
That means, the person...
When you're at work on your computer,


633
00:30:28.803 --> 00:30:30.263
the person that comes up
on your left shoulder


634
00:30:30.346 --> 00:30:31.890
and taps you, and you turn around there,

635
00:30:31.973 --> 00:30:34.350
and then they've moved over
to your right shoulder,


636
00:30:34.434 --> 00:30:36.394
and they think that's funny...

637
00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:39.355
That person's vote counts the same
as yours every election.


638
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.193
That means your funny cousin...

639
00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:46.738
At a family get-together,
you have a drink in your hand,


640
00:30:46.821 --> 00:30:48.489
and they come up behind you

641
00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:51.117
and say hello by giving you the knee
to the back of your knee,


642
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.578
so you go like that and spill your drink
and almost fall,


643
00:30:53.995 --> 00:30:56.748
that person gets the same
federal holidays that you get.


644
00:31:01.002 --> 00:31:04.714
Miss, you probably get up at 6:00,

645
00:31:04.797 --> 00:31:07.842
go to work, whatever free time you have,
you try to be a good citizen.


646
00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:09.802
Vote, try to look at the issues.

647
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.680
Lowlife back there, gets up at 11:00,

648
00:31:12.764 --> 00:31:14.682
checks the Bleacher Report.

649
00:31:15.767 --> 00:31:21.940
Last time he voted was
the NL All-Star Game 2012, you know.


650
00:31:23.316 --> 00:31:25.443
Same stamp on his passport that you have.

651
00:31:26.277 --> 00:31:28.404
That's equality. 
It's not justice.

652
00:31:28.488 --> 00:31:30.239
It's democracy, animal.

653
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:37.246
Yeah, 'cause "democracy" is another one
of those great words,


654
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.041
but really, democracy... First of all,

655
00:31:40.124 --> 00:31:43.711
we live collectively in a democracy,
which is fine.


656
00:31:43.795 --> 00:31:46.506
Individually, you have not
lived in a democracy.


657
00:31:46.589 --> 00:31:50.093
Your life has not been...
A sliver of it has been in democ...


658
00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:52.095
Eight hours a day you've been at work.

659
00:31:52.178 --> 00:31:54.847
That's a dictatorship.
You don't vote at work.


660
00:31:55.807 --> 00:31:58.351
"We want Thursday afternoons off,
we voted."


661
00:31:59.686 --> 00:32:00.728
"You're fired."

662
00:32:02.522 --> 00:32:05.650
Six hours a day, you're with your family.
That's a tribal system.


663
00:32:06.442 --> 00:32:08.528
An hour and a half a day,
you're on the subway.


664
00:32:08.611 --> 00:32:10.613
That's a failed anarchist experiment.

665
00:32:12.782 --> 00:32:14.659
And six hours a day, you're asleep.

666
00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:18.037
So, you live in a democracy
two and a half hours a day of your life.


667
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:21.541
Half that time, you're arguing
over mispronunciations with Alexa.


668
00:32:23.042 --> 00:32:25.253
Waiting for your name
to be called out at Starbucks.


669
00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:29.924
'Cause democracy is not
a functioning system.


670
00:32:30.008 --> 00:32:31.634
It's a great concept.

671
00:32:31.718 --> 00:32:34.429
We don't use it at work.
We don't use it at school.


672
00:32:34.512 --> 00:32:37.473
You need a teacher.
A strong leader, a teacher.


673
00:32:37.974 --> 00:32:39.934
You see what happens
when the teacher leaves


674
00:32:40.018 --> 00:32:41.811
and the kids are in the playground
for recess.


675
00:32:41.894 --> 00:32:44.522
They form their own government,
and it ain't a democracy.


676
00:32:46.524 --> 00:32:47.942
It's law of the jungle.

677
00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:52.155
Suddenly, warlords start to emerge,
giving out orders.


678
00:32:52.864 --> 00:32:54.657
"Trip him, he's got books."

679
00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:58.036
"Push him, he's got glasses."

680
00:32:58.244 --> 00:33:00.413
"Pull her hair, she's too quiet."

681
00:33:00.872 --> 00:33:02.957
It becomes a pack of hyenas

682
00:33:03.416 --> 00:33:06.127
looking for the gazelle
with the braces and the inhaler.


683
00:33:07.754 --> 00:33:10.298
Yeah. Democracy is... First of all,

684
00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:12.925
Founding Fathers didn't come up with it.
Greeks invented it.


685
00:33:13.217 --> 00:33:16.971
They just rode their wave. They were
in the right place at the right time.


686
00:33:17.055 --> 00:33:18.556
Now, they're on the right side of history,

687
00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:22.393
which is all anybody wants anymore,
to be on the right side of history.


688
00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:24.520
What a foolish goal. 
You'll never know.

689
00:33:24.854 --> 00:33:27.106
You can be on the right side,
then you're on the wrong side one day.


690
00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:29.067
You know who was on
the right side of history?


691
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.860
Five-hundred years in this country,

692
00:33:30.943 --> 00:33:32.528
Christopher Columbus.

693
00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:36.032
From 1492 till 1992,

694
00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:38.534
you never heard a
bad word about this guy.

695
00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:43.748
They named cities after him,

696
00:33:44.207 --> 00:33:47.502
schools, streets, circles.

697
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:55.927
Then one day, like 11 years ago,
people started coming to me,


698
00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.720
"You know what tomorrow is, right?

699
00:33:57.804 --> 00:33:59.013
Columbus Day."

700
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.057
Like it was Manson's birthday.

701
00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:05.311
He went from the right side
to the wrong side,


702
00:34:05.394 --> 00:34:07.772
and he was dead the whole time.
He didn't do anything different.


703
00:34:09.232 --> 00:34:12.902
But the thing about our country,
we try to atone for our sins of the past.


704
00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:15.613
So, right now, some states are already

705
00:34:15.696 --> 00:34:18.658
changing the name of Columbus Day
to "Indigenous Peoples' Day."


706
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:20.576
Everybody goes,
"That's great. What a great idea."


707
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.911
That's how stupid everybody is.

708
00:34:22.578 --> 00:34:24.705
First of all, do you think
Indigenous people want


709
00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:28.084
their national holiday to be on the day
Columbus landed in America?


710
00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:32.713
This is...

711
00:34:36.425 --> 00:34:39.679
You know, this is when you know
a country is on its way out,


712
00:34:39.762 --> 00:34:42.306
when, even our holidays,

713
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:44.976
we gotta have drama
questioning our holiday


714
00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:47.687
'cause that means
we're questioning ourselves, our identity.


715
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.231
We still celebrate 'em,
but there's always controversy.


716
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.609
Celebrate Thanksgiving
but just focus on the family.


717
00:34:53.693 --> 00:34:55.653
You'll never see the picture
you saw when I was a kid,


718
00:34:55.736 --> 00:34:56.946
with a long table,

719
00:34:57.029 --> 00:34:59.699
with the Pilgrims and the tribal chiefs
breaking bread.


720
00:34:59.907 --> 00:35:02.994
Just a close-up on the turkey.
Crop out the backstory.


721
00:35:04.954 --> 00:35:07.456
Still celebrate Christmas,
but no Christ, no mass,


722
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.833
but just "Christ-mas."

723
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.921
I don't know how Valentine's Day
has slipped under the radar.


724
00:35:14.755 --> 00:35:17.967
Talk about the unequal power,
gendered dynamics.


725
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.887
Trading chocolate
and flowers for sex. What...


726
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.514
That's okay?

727
00:35:24.432 --> 00:35:26.767
Cupid's arrow raises consent issues.

728
00:35:29.687 --> 00:35:31.439
It's a mythological roofie.

729
00:35:35.193 --> 00:35:37.361
We still celebrate Fourth of July.

730
00:35:37.445 --> 00:35:39.113
That's the one I would've gotten rid of,

731
00:35:39.197 --> 00:35:41.532
because the Declaration of Independence,

732
00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:43.534
that created expectation.

733
00:35:43.701 --> 00:35:45.411
We made promises there.

734
00:35:45.494 --> 00:35:48.289
We declared ourselves to be the good guy.

735
00:35:48.372 --> 00:35:49.749
What a rookie move.

736
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:52.126
You never go full good guy.

737
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:54.795
Then you have to live up to it.

738
00:35:54.879 --> 00:35:56.839
Russia played history perfectly.

739
00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:59.217
From day one they go, "We're the asshole."

740
00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:03.346
Then no matter what they do...
They invade the Ukraine.


741
00:36:03.429 --> 00:36:04.555
You're like, "That's messed up.

742
00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:07.475
They did say they were
the asshole, though. Give 'em that."


743
00:36:08.184 --> 00:36:12.271
And now, here it is, 243 years later,

744
00:36:12.355 --> 00:36:14.023
and we're running on fumes.

745
00:36:14.106 --> 00:36:17.526
America, we had such promise, you know.

746
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:20.112
Mmm. We lived up to...

747
00:36:20.363 --> 00:36:22.657
Some of the big promises,
we did live up to.


748
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.283
The big one, when I was a kid,

749
00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:26.702
they said, "The reason
the United States is so great,


750
00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:30.039
anybody can grow up and become
President of the United States."


751
00:36:35.127 --> 00:36:37.421
Hey, they said "anybody."
They weren't kidding on that one.


752
00:36:38.673 --> 00:36:42.593
But just because Trump
spends all day on Twitter,


753
00:36:42.677 --> 00:36:46.597
inflicting his severe
psychological damage on all of us,


754
00:36:48.224 --> 00:36:50.059
doesn't mean you don't do the same thing.

755
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.062
Because Trump is more than just a person,

756
00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:55.147
and less than just a person, ironic.

757
00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:56.899
He's an idea.

758
00:36:56.983 --> 00:37:00.569
And he's the hill the people he speaks to
have chosen to die on,


759
00:37:00.653 --> 00:37:02.029
and they're not all Nazis.

760
00:37:02.113 --> 00:37:06.909
Because if you're crouching as a plumber
under a rusty sink after the age of 40,


761
00:37:06.993 --> 00:37:10.413
with bad knees,
a three-Bavarian-cream habit a day,


762
00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:13.207
and a 12-year-old truck,

763
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.501
you don't like being told
to acknowledge your privilege.


764
00:37:15.584 --> 00:37:18.462
And everybody's telling you to do that,
except Trump.


765
00:37:18.963 --> 00:37:20.798
Because it's easy to be charitable

766
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:23.342
when it's not your job on the line.
All right?


767
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:27.555
I mean, right now, you know and I know,
somewhere out there...


768
00:37:27.888 --> 00:37:30.474
south of the border,
there's a Mexican George Clooney,


769
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.060
better-looking than George Clooney,

770
00:37:33.144 --> 00:37:35.563
a better actor, more charismatic,

771
00:37:36.022 --> 00:37:37.273
and he would do George Clooney movies

772
00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:40.026
for one-twentieth the salary
that George does it for.


773
00:37:41.152 --> 00:37:43.279
And if he ever
makes his way up north,

774
00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:44.739
George Clooney might be chanting,

775
00:37:44.822 --> 00:37:46.741
"Build that wall! 
Build that wall!"

776
00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:56.876
Because some people hear Trump,
they probably hear the Founding Fathers.


777
00:37:56.959 --> 00:37:58.377
Hey, you never heard
the Founding Fathers talk.


778
00:37:58.461 --> 00:37:59.545
What if they sounded like Trump?

779
00:37:59.628 --> 00:38:02.381
[imitating Trump] "We, the people
of the United States,


780
00:38:02.465 --> 00:38:04.842
in order to form a more perfect Union...

781
00:38:04.925 --> 00:38:07.928
and actually it's getting pretty perfect,
it's actually pretty fantastic.


782
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:12.558
They won't... They don't wanna report it.
It's pretty great.


783
00:38:13.267 --> 00:38:16.020
James Madison, very bright guy.
James Madison.


784
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.647
Little Jimmy.
I call him 'Little Jimmy' Madison.


785
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:20.149
It's a joke. Take a joke.

786
00:38:20.232 --> 00:38:22.610
He can't take a joke.
He doesn't take a joke.


787
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.154
Alexander Hamilton.

788
00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:26.947
Crazy Al. I call him 'Crazy Al.'

789
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.116
He wants to start a bank.
He wants to start a national bank.


790
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.370
I don't know. Maybe we will.
We'll see. We'll see."


791
00:38:36.707 --> 00:38:38.667
[in normal voice] 'Cause the mistake is,
you're looking at him


792
00:38:38.751 --> 00:38:41.545
like he's a candidate
that was elected to political office,


793
00:38:41.629 --> 00:38:43.464
he's a... Instead of what he was,

794
00:38:43.547 --> 00:38:44.590
a middle finger.

795
00:38:44.673 --> 00:38:48.177
Because look at Christians.
Intelligent people say to me,


796
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.346
"How could Christians
have voted for Trump?"


797
00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:53.349
Here's the left's strategy
to Christians the past 50 years.


798
00:38:53.557 --> 00:38:56.310
"Hey, you superstitious idiots.
Are you gonna vote for us?"


799
00:38:57.228 --> 00:38:58.938
I don't know why that doesn't work.

800
00:39:01.148 --> 00:39:03.984
Trump was probably
the least Christian person


801
00:39:04.068 --> 00:39:06.570
that's walked the face of the Earth
in a couple of centuries, but...


802
00:39:07.822 --> 00:39:09.073
he brings them in.

803
00:39:09.156 --> 00:39:11.283
Gives the speeches
like it's a corporate event.


804
00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:12.993
You know, he doesn't really know,
but he's like...


805
00:39:13.202 --> 00:39:14.495
[imitating Trump] "You Christian people,

806
00:39:14.578 --> 00:39:16.747
are some of the most fantastic,
tremendous people.


807
00:39:16.914 --> 00:39:20.960
Your faith is actually a wonderful thing.
I love your faith. I love it. I...


808
00:39:21.293 --> 00:39:23.879
The Bible is a great read, by the way.
What a great...


809
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.257
What a great, great book.

810
00:39:26.549 --> 00:39:28.634
I read it at Mar-a-Lago.
I never read it before, I read it.


811
00:39:28.717 --> 00:39:30.594
Fantastic. Could not put it down.

812
00:39:30.678 --> 00:39:33.055
Read it at Mar-a-Lago. It's a beach read.
It's a great beach read.


813
00:39:35.224 --> 00:39:36.642
You got Joseph and Mary,

814
00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:38.686
they're trying to get in...
They're trying to get in, she's pregnant.


815
00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:40.396
She's about to have the baby.
They can't get in.


816
00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:42.481
They can't get in, I don't know why.
Nobody lets them in the inn.


817
00:39:42.565 --> 00:39:44.608
No room at the inn. 
I've owned hotels.

818
00:39:44.692 --> 00:39:46.861
Sometimes you don't want people in
for different reasons.


819
00:39:46.944 --> 00:39:48.362
But, you know...

820
00:39:48.988 --> 00:39:50.906
They finally do get in.
They have the baby.


821
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.242
He grows up
to become a tremendous success.


822
00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:56.912
And, uh, lot of things happen.
Some good, some not so good.


823
00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:01.167
Treated very unfairly, by the way.
Very unfairly.


824
00:40:01.959 --> 00:40:03.544
Jesus, it's really...

825
00:40:03.627 --> 00:40:06.005
It's actually a disgrace,
the way Jesus was treated.


826
00:40:06.088 --> 00:40:07.214
I'll be honest with you."

827
00:40:08.507 --> 00:40:10.342
[in normal voice]
Yeah. But even the people who love Trump,


828
00:40:10.426 --> 00:40:12.553
I think we all know
how this is gonna end.

829
00:40:12.636 --> 00:40:13.679
'Cause you think the term...

830
00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:15.973
It's obviously not gonna
be the traditional,


831
00:40:16.056 --> 00:40:18.142
waving goodbye on the White House lawn.

832
00:40:18.225 --> 00:40:19.768
Jump in the chopper.

833
00:40:19.852 --> 00:40:22.396
Even he doesn't think
it'll end that way, hmm?


834
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.065
It's probably... Last scene in <i>Scarface,</i>
I would think.


835
00:40:29.028 --> 00:40:30.070
You know?

836
00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:32.615
It just... It can be no other.

837
00:40:33.157 --> 00:40:35.576
Just, you know,
Trump sitting alone in the Oval Office


838
00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:36.911
at a giant table.

839
00:40:37.161 --> 00:40:39.914
Snorting whatever prescription meds
he's been doing this whole time.


840
00:40:41.165 --> 00:40:42.208
Abandoned by everybody.

841
00:40:42.291 --> 00:40:44.710
Just like, Tony Montana relates to him.
Like Tony, you know...


842
00:40:45.044 --> 00:40:46.712
Navy SEALs go through the bay windows.

843
00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:48.339
You hear flashbang grenades.

844
00:40:48.422 --> 00:40:49.924
They carry a stretcher,
comes out and you're like,


845
00:40:50.007 --> 00:40:52.760
"Jesus... Well, I kind of thought so,
but Jesus Christ."


846
00:40:53.761 --> 00:40:55.179
But however Trump leaves,

847
00:40:55.262 --> 00:40:57.806
our fundamental differences
don't leave with him.


848
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.225
We're still divided.

849
00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:02.895
The Founding Fathers wrote
in the Declaration of Independence,


850
00:41:02.978 --> 00:41:04.563
"When in the course of human events,

851
00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:07.983
it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve


852
00:41:08.067 --> 00:41:10.528
the political bands
that have connected them to another..."


853
00:41:10.778 --> 00:41:12.488
And they were writing that
about us and England,


854
00:41:12.571 --> 00:41:15.241
but they say, subconsciously,
you're always writing about yourself.


855
00:41:15.574 --> 00:41:16.659
And maybe...

856
00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.869
they knew this day was coming.

857
00:41:19.328 --> 00:41:20.871
And now this day is here.

858
00:41:21.455 --> 00:41:22.498
And now what, you know?

859
00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:26.585
No, I'm asking you. Now what? I don't...

860
00:41:28.754 --> 00:41:30.172
I wrote 60% of this show

861
00:41:30.256 --> 00:41:33.092
and I was like, "Wow, this was hard."
You know?


862
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.845
Um, well, we have a suggestion box
in the lobby.


863
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:39.139
If anybody is so inclined...
You never know.


864
00:41:39.223 --> 00:41:40.766
Um, yeah.

865
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:43.352
My idea, we break it up into city-states.

866
00:41:43.435 --> 00:41:45.771
Ancient Greece gave us democracy,
they gave us city-states.


867
00:41:45.854 --> 00:41:47.314
Use it. City-states...

868
00:41:47.398 --> 00:41:49.650
'Cause Greece understood
when Persia invades,


869
00:41:49.733 --> 00:41:52.194
you have to be united.
Otherwise, don't go near each other.


870
00:41:52.278 --> 00:41:53.571
"We have nothing in common."

871
00:41:53.654 --> 00:41:55.239
Totally different personalities.

872
00:41:55.322 --> 00:41:56.991
Sparta, Athens...

873
00:41:57.074 --> 00:41:59.159
Sparta, all jocks.

874
00:41:59.243 --> 00:42:03.289
Basically standing around doing
kettlebell swings with Venetians' heads.


875
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:06.500
If you went over 8% body fat,

876
00:42:06.584 --> 00:42:08.460
they'd throw you in the river,
get rid of you.


877
00:42:09.336 --> 00:42:11.338
Even little kids had to be tough.

878
00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:14.091
Babies walking around,
"I like your six-pack.


879
00:42:14.174 --> 00:42:16.510
Well, you look pretty good, you know.
What are you doing?"


880
00:42:16.594 --> 00:42:18.220
"I told my mother no more breast-feeding.

881
00:42:18.304 --> 00:42:20.222
I cut out dairy. 
It changed my life."

882
00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:25.102
Then you have Athens. 
Total opposite.

883
00:42:25.185 --> 00:42:28.314
Intellectual thinkers walking up
to each other all day.


884
00:42:28.814 --> 00:42:30.024
"Let me ask you something." "What?"

885
00:42:30.107 --> 00:42:31.150
"What is ethics?"

886
00:42:31.233 --> 00:42:33.444
"Whoa, you're blowing my mind right now.

887
00:42:34.445 --> 00:42:37.489
I was gonna ask you, 'What is truth?'
And you asked me, 'What is ethics?'"


888
00:42:37.573 --> 00:42:39.908
They'd discuss that for three months.
It was...


889
00:42:39.992 --> 00:42:43.621
It was these courtyards
of overly chatty people


890
00:42:43.704 --> 00:42:46.999
having these endless, circular,
annoying conversations.


891
00:42:47.458 --> 00:42:49.627
The Golden Age of Athens was a nightmare.

892
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.879
It was a 250-year podcast.

893
00:42:57.551 --> 00:43:00.346
That's what we do.
Break up into red states, blue states,


894
00:43:00.429 --> 00:43:01.889
in-between states.

895
00:43:01.972 --> 00:43:03.641
<i>E pluribus pluribus.</i>

896
00:43:04.475 --> 00:43:06.477
"Out of many, a few more."

897
00:43:08.103 --> 00:43:10.356
A year from now
you could be going to visit


898
00:43:10.439 --> 00:43:12.149
family and friends in the red states.

899
00:43:12.232 --> 00:43:15.611
Drive in, start to hear Rascal Flatts
in the background.


900
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.238
Smell barbecue, Aqua Nets.

901
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.450
You get in. It's divided up

902
00:43:21.533 --> 00:43:24.536
into truck stop, 
RV park, mega-church.

903
00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:27.206
Everybody's wearing orange vests.

904
00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:29.416
It's always hunting season
in the red states.


905
00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:31.669
Everybody's got a gun.

906
00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:34.421
The president of the NRA
is like the Tim Cook.


907
00:43:34.505 --> 00:43:37.633
He does launches every year
with a new product.


908
00:43:37.716 --> 00:43:38.759
Instead of the Apple it's like,

909
00:43:38.842 --> 00:43:41.261
"Okay, this is an iPhone Predator drone.

910
00:43:42.304 --> 00:43:44.223
It goes into your contacts,

911
00:43:44.306 --> 00:43:46.809
syncs it with Google Maps,
and all you do is go,


912
00:43:46.892 --> 00:43:48.560
'Siri, kill Steve.'"

913
00:43:51.647 --> 00:43:53.315
Then you go to the blue states.

914
00:43:53.399 --> 00:43:55.567
Your progressive states, safe states.

915
00:43:55.984 --> 00:43:58.237
You know, you go
in there, you get close.

916
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.447
You start to see giant speakers
on the trees


917
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:02.449
blasting <i>All Things Considered.</i>

918
00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:05.494
You smell fair-trade coffee.

919
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.832
You go in there and people are getting
arrested for micro-aggressions.


920
00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:14.795
They're going to jail for mansplaining
and fat-shaming


921
00:44:14.878 --> 00:44:17.089
and file-sharing and live-streaming.

922
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:20.509
The cops pull you over
for cultural appropriations.


923
00:44:21.927 --> 00:44:23.512
It's like, "No, Officer,
these aren't dreadlocks.


924
00:44:23.595 --> 00:44:25.639
The rain does this to my hair.
I swear to God."


925
00:44:26.682 --> 00:44:28.726
He's like,
"Miss, are those hoop earrings?"


926
00:44:28.809 --> 00:44:30.978
"My mother's Peruvian. I have ID."

927
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.063
He's like, "I don't believe her.

928
00:44:33.147 --> 00:44:35.315
Give her a 23andMe.
Let's get to the bottom of this."


929
00:44:38.986 --> 00:44:42.156
And I know there are some people that go,
"No, we're the United States."


930
00:44:42.239 --> 00:44:44.950
They don't want to give up on the idea
of these United States.


931
00:44:45.033 --> 00:44:46.118
And what do they say?

932
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:48.078
"We never tried the system
the way it was supposed to be.


933
00:44:48.162 --> 00:44:49.788
Never tried pure capitalism.

934
00:44:49.872 --> 00:44:51.582
Never tried pure socialism."

935
00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:53.375
We'll have city-states try those too.

936
00:44:53.834 --> 00:44:56.628
Capitalism, another great idea
that we took too far.


937
00:44:56.712 --> 00:44:58.338
It started out as a great idea.

938
00:44:58.422 --> 00:45:00.799
One man, one business,
his name on the business.


939
00:45:00.883 --> 00:45:03.177
Henry Ford. Ford Motor Company.

940
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.013
And what would he say?
"My responsibility is to my workers."


941
00:45:06.096 --> 00:45:07.681
He'd walk around all day.

942
00:45:07.764 --> 00:45:11.268
"Hey, uh, Bill, I told you
counter-clockwise on those brake pads.


943
00:45:11.351 --> 00:45:12.811
Ah-ha-ha! You know."

944
00:45:12.895 --> 00:45:14.229
He talked to everybody.

945
00:45:14.313 --> 00:45:15.939
"You betcha, Mr. Ford."

946
00:45:16.315 --> 00:45:18.025
But it became too successful.

947
00:45:18.108 --> 00:45:20.068
Businesses got replaced by corporations,

948
00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:23.030
and somebody more important
than the worker emerged from that.


949
00:45:23.113 --> 00:45:24.281
The investor.

950
00:45:24.364 --> 00:45:26.909
And investors have
different goals from workers.


951
00:45:26.992 --> 00:45:28.368
They want cheaper labor.

952
00:45:28.452 --> 00:45:31.538
So, when the blue-collar
red-state worker says,


953
00:45:31.622 --> 00:45:33.123
"Immigrants are taking my jobs,

954
00:45:33.207 --> 00:45:36.710
technically, they're being given their job
by the owner to please the investor.


955
00:45:36.793 --> 00:45:38.754
And then the owner, of course,
is gonna plead innocence.


956
00:45:38.837 --> 00:45:40.506
"It's nothing to do with me. I just...

957
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:42.090
I didn't know the guy's here illegally.

958
00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.550
He said he went to my high school."

959
00:45:46.803 --> 00:45:49.223
They go, "But the guy doesn't
speak a word of English."


960
00:45:49.348 --> 00:45:52.351
He's like, "I know. It wasn't a very good
high school, by the way."


961
00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.896
But if you want free market,
that's free market.


962
00:45:55.979 --> 00:45:58.565
A lot of socialists
too. And I get it.

963
00:45:58.649 --> 00:46:01.902
It's the participation trophy
of governmental systems.


964
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.613
Everybody gets a trophy.
Everybody gets a paycheck.


965
00:46:05.113 --> 00:46:07.824
And a lot of rich people
are socialists now, which is...


966
00:46:07.908 --> 00:46:09.660
Never trust a socialist
with a summer house.


967
00:46:09.743 --> 00:46:11.078
I've always said this. You know?

968
00:46:13.789 --> 00:46:16.750
And the problem with socialism, they say,
"Let the workers have power.


969
00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:19.545
They'll behave better than the owner
or the investor."


970
00:46:19.628 --> 00:46:21.296
Now, power corrupts everybody.

971
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.840
We all have the one friend
that has no power,


972
00:46:23.924 --> 00:46:26.051
and you go, "Thank God
that person doesn't have power.


973
00:46:26.677 --> 00:46:28.053
They would be a tyrant."

974
00:46:28.679 --> 00:46:29.888
I have one friend from the Bronx,

975
00:46:29.972 --> 00:46:32.015
just obsessed that I'm from Brooklyn.

976
00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:34.184
He's always like, "You gotta come up
to this one pizza place."


977
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:36.478
For years, he's like, "You gotta try
the pizza in the Bronx. Best pizza ever."


978
00:46:36.562 --> 00:46:38.397
I'm like, "Yeah,
Brooklyn has good pizza too."


979
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.357
"This is the best."
We finally get up there,


980
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.650
try the pizza, it's great.

981
00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:42.985
So I go, "This pizza is great."

982
00:46:43.068 --> 00:46:45.571
He goes, "Better than the pizza
you grew up with?"


983
00:46:45.779 --> 00:46:48.699
Because for some people,
it's not enough.


984
00:46:48.782 --> 00:46:52.703
Equality, compromise, sharing...

985
00:46:52.786 --> 00:46:54.329
it means nothing to them.

986
00:46:54.413 --> 00:46:56.873
Unless you can submit to their will,

987
00:46:57.624 --> 00:46:59.876
turn your back
on your childhood pizza place,


988
00:47:01.336 --> 00:47:04.089
and spit on the
memory of the pizza guy

989
00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:06.300
that gave me free zeppoles as a child...

990
00:47:08.218 --> 00:47:09.636
they can't enjoy themselves.

991
00:47:10.262 --> 00:47:11.388
They want power.

992
00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:13.849
But if you want socialism,
you have to live it, though.


993
00:47:13.932 --> 00:47:15.225
No theoretical socialist.

994
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:17.853
That means rotate jobs every year.

995
00:47:18.228 --> 00:47:20.147
Bell rings. Chinese food delivery.

996
00:47:20.647 --> 00:47:22.608
"George Clooney. You again?
What are you doing?


997
00:47:23.692 --> 00:47:24.693
Where's Xao Peng?"

998
00:47:24.776 --> 00:47:28.280
"He's in Lake Como
with a model on my boat right now.


999
00:47:29.156 --> 00:47:30.991
I'm living in a rooming house
on Sunset Park.


1000
00:47:31.074 --> 00:47:32.451
I should've kept my mouth shut."

1001
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.829
And I understand it's sad
breaking up the United States,


1002
00:47:35.912 --> 00:47:38.290
but we're already broken up,
this would just be acknowledging it.


1003
00:47:38.373 --> 00:47:39.666
We're already tribal.

1004
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.710
We're broken into tribes already.
It's over.


1005
00:47:41.918 --> 00:47:45.130
Liberal, conservative,
white, black, Latino,


1006
00:47:45.213 --> 00:47:47.466
Asian, Wall Street, Main Street,

1007
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:50.135
the working poor,
the forgotten middle class,


1008
00:47:50.218 --> 00:47:52.638
feminists, soccer moms, Bernie bros,

1009
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:55.349
dad bods, man tits, mom jeans,

1010
00:47:55.432 --> 00:47:58.018
muffin-tops, unibrows...

1011
00:47:58.101 --> 00:48:00.062
Paleo, cardio, keto,

1012
00:48:00.145 --> 00:48:01.563
intersectional, trans, vegans...

1013
00:48:01.897 --> 00:48:05.233
We're more tribal
than 18th-century Afghanistan.


1014
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:09.071
Just admit it. Yeah.

1015
00:48:14.284 --> 00:48:15.327
Yeah.

1016
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.620
Well, maybe we go out gracefully.

1017
00:48:16.703 --> 00:48:19.873
Admit we had a good run,
we ran its course.


1018
00:48:19.956 --> 00:48:22.959
I mean, we did pretty good.
We got dropped down here naked,


1019
00:48:23.585 --> 00:48:26.463
surrounded by SUV-sized tigers, monsters,

1020
00:48:26.922 --> 00:48:29.466
and we beat them all,
we conquered them all


1021
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:32.636
just with our minds
and our opposable thumbs to make weapons.


1022
00:48:34.304 --> 00:48:36.515
Yeah, these helped us survive.

1023
00:48:36.598 --> 00:48:39.059
And ironically,
they're gonna destroy us now.


1024
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:41.311
Yeah.

1025
00:48:48.402 --> 00:48:50.987
And I mean, we did good.
We made something out of nothing.


1026
00:48:51.279 --> 00:48:53.782
And the last thing we made,
last thing we're gonna make,


1027
00:48:53.865 --> 00:48:55.450
AI, robots.

1028
00:48:55.534 --> 00:48:58.662
'Cause robots are here to replace us.
And they should, right?


1029
00:48:58.745 --> 00:48:59.788
I mean...

1030
00:49:01.456 --> 00:49:04.376
They just work so much better,
so efficient...


1031
00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:09.256
And some people go, "Yeah, but what about
humor, love, the human touch?"


1032
00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:11.925
My phone, which I've had
for a year and a half,


1033
00:49:12.008 --> 00:49:13.969
has given me more pleasure

1034
00:49:14.511 --> 00:49:15.804
and information

1035
00:49:16.346 --> 00:49:19.433
than all my friends put together
over the entire course of my life.


1036
00:49:21.393 --> 00:49:23.645
If you had to give up
your cell phone right now,


1037
00:49:23.729 --> 00:49:25.772
right here, for the rest of your life...

1038
00:49:26.106 --> 00:49:28.942
Give up your cell phone
and never have a cell phone again,


1039
00:49:29.025 --> 00:49:33.321
or you get a new updated cell phone
every year for free,


1040
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.743
but one of your friends,
the one that you fight with the most,


1041
00:49:38.785 --> 00:49:39.995
has to die.

1042
00:49:41.496 --> 00:49:43.123
I mean, you don't have
to say it out loud,

1043
00:49:43.206 --> 00:49:45.625
just think in your heart
what you would really...


1044
00:49:46.168 --> 00:49:47.461
What you would really do.

1045
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.504
See?

1046
00:49:51.214 --> 00:49:53.008
I mean, look.

1047
00:49:53.592 --> 00:49:56.428
Nobody lifted a finger
when robots replaced horses.


1048
00:49:56.511 --> 00:49:57.929
Cars are robots for horses.

1049
00:49:58.013 --> 00:50:00.348
That's the first time jobs got replaced.

1050
00:50:01.016 --> 00:50:04.686
I mean, horses worked for us,
and they did more than just cars.


1051
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.773
They were your tractor,
they were your hunting companion,


1052
00:50:07.856 --> 00:50:11.610
your emotional support animal,
your best friend.


1053
00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:13.737
They were your family.
You knew them your whole life.


1054
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.238
You were a little kid in the field,
they'd go,


1055
00:50:15.322 --> 00:50:17.699
"See that pony?
That's gonna be your horse one day."


1056
00:50:17.783 --> 00:50:20.243
"Oh!" You'd start to nod at each other
when you'd pass by.


1057
00:50:20.827 --> 00:50:21.870
"Huh."

1058
00:50:21.953 --> 00:50:24.706
Finally, the big day comes,
you drive into town together.


1059
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.792
They're with you for every family event.

1060
00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:29.711
Every function. Take you to work,
take you to your marriage.


1061
00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:32.547
War starts,
they go to the frontlines with you.


1062
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:34.966
They died with you.
What greater love is there?


1063
00:50:35.717 --> 00:50:37.177
And then, cars got invented,

1064
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.720
and we just put 'em out to pasture

1065
00:50:38.804 --> 00:50:40.680
like they never meant nothin' to us.

1066
00:50:41.723 --> 00:50:44.684
They're standing in the field,
we're driving by in a Model T Ford.


1067
00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.145
They're like, "I don't believe this, man.

1068
00:50:47.229 --> 00:50:50.106
I saved this son of a bitch's life
at the Battle of San Juan Hill.


1069
00:50:52.984 --> 00:50:55.487
He likes that robot better than me?
They deserve each other.


1070
00:50:55.946 --> 00:50:57.113
He's a robot..."

1071
00:50:57.197 --> 00:50:58.907
They probably sensed, horse sense...

1072
00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:01.618
They sensed we lost our humanity
right then.


1073
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:05.789
Because the history of humanity

1074
00:51:05.872 --> 00:51:07.999
has been the life of a person.

1075
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.043
Early man was like a newborn.

1076
00:51:10.126 --> 00:51:12.546
He could barely stand up, can't talk,

1077
00:51:12.796 --> 00:51:15.757
trying to form words,
surrounded by giant animals.


1078
00:51:16.675 --> 00:51:18.468
Ancient Greece is like
the four-year-old kid,


1079
00:51:18.552 --> 00:51:20.720
just annoying people,
asking questions all day.


1080
00:51:21.513 --> 00:51:24.558
"What's that? Why? Why?
What's that? But why?"


1081
00:51:26.768 --> 00:51:28.395
Roman Empire's like the 13-year-old.

1082
00:51:28.478 --> 00:51:30.522
Walking around cocky, bumping into people,

1083
00:51:30.605 --> 00:51:32.649
snapping each other
with towels in the baths.


1084
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:37.487
The Dark Ages, you're like the 19-year-old

1085
00:51:37.571 --> 00:51:39.489
when you think the world
revolves around you...


1086
00:51:40.031 --> 00:51:41.575
until Copernicus proves it doesn't.

1087
00:51:41.658 --> 00:51:43.660
It kind of shatters
your whole idea of life.


1088
00:51:44.953 --> 00:51:47.080
The Enlightenment,
when you're in your mid-20s,


1089
00:51:47.163 --> 00:51:48.290
and you kind of feel innocent.

1090
00:51:48.373 --> 00:51:49.791
Like, "We can get along.

1091
00:51:49.875 --> 00:51:52.252
Humanity is good. 
We can make this work."

1092
00:51:52.335 --> 00:51:54.087
And the Industrial Revolution,

1093
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.755
when you're in your 30s
and you get cynical.


1094
00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:58.633
You're like, "Just give me my paycheck.
I don't care.


1095
00:51:59.134 --> 00:52:01.720
Just doing my job. 
Every man for himself."

1096
00:52:03.346 --> 00:52:04.598
And now, the digital age.

1097
00:52:04.681 --> 00:52:06.224
We're all like the old person
about to die.


1098
00:52:06.308 --> 00:52:08.226
Everybody's hunched over, medicated.

1099
00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:10.729
Cursing at the news.

1100
00:52:11.938 --> 00:52:14.900
Maybe we already are
out to pasture, you know?


1101
00:52:14.983 --> 00:52:16.860
Spend most of the
time in the house, numb,

1102
00:52:16.943 --> 00:52:19.362
waiting for the bell to ring
with an Amazon delivery...


1103
00:52:21.323 --> 00:52:22.365
Jeff Bezos...

1104
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:25.327
Three years from now, Jeff Bezos
is gonna get on every device in your house


1105
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.578
whether it's on or not.

1106
00:52:27.078 --> 00:52:28.705
And he's just gonna be real,

1107
00:52:28.788 --> 00:52:31.082
and go, "Okay, here's the way it is.

1108
00:52:31.166 --> 00:52:33.251
Nobody leaves your house from now on.

1109
00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:37.881
You want something, tell us what it is
and we'll send it to you.


1110
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:41.718
We're sending you all
a free pair of pajamas.


1111
00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:44.763
Put the pajamas on, start ordering stuff.

1112
00:52:44.846 --> 00:52:47.849
Outside is over. 
It's inside from now on."

1113
00:52:49.684 --> 00:52:50.852
Yeah.

1114
00:52:56.149 --> 00:52:57.859
Yeah, he's gonna demolish outsides.

1115
00:52:57.943 --> 00:52:58.985
It'll be gone.

1116
00:52:59.069 --> 00:53:00.904
You'll be like,
"Well, what if I want fresh air?"


1117
00:53:00.987 --> 00:53:03.031
"How many canisters
of fresh air do you need?"


1118
00:53:05.575 --> 00:53:06.576
Yeah.

1119
00:53:11.414 --> 00:53:12.415
Yeah.

1120
00:53:12.499 --> 00:53:14.334
You go outside three years from now,
there'll be nothing.


1121
00:53:14.417 --> 00:53:17.545
Rats, roaches,
and Amazon delivery trucks, that's it.


1122
00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:21.716
So, what do we do?
We continue along this path,


1123
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.843
adding fuel to the fire,

1124
00:53:24.386 --> 00:53:26.680
keep going down this bad road?

1125
00:53:27.055 --> 00:53:28.098
Probably.

1126
00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:30.100
Or, here's a radical idea,

1127
00:53:30.183 --> 00:53:32.143
we start to look at ourselves.

1128
00:53:32.227 --> 00:53:33.937
Take some responsibility.

1129
00:53:34.396 --> 00:53:35.981
See, we have people doing shit for us

1130
00:53:36.064 --> 00:53:38.483
we should be doing ourselves
most of the time anyway.


1131
00:53:38.566 --> 00:53:39.985
Could you hold this
for me for a second?

1132
00:53:47.617 --> 00:53:52.372
We look in the mirror
and see ourselves as we really are.


1133
00:53:52.872 --> 00:53:56.501
And realize, most of what everybody
says about each other is true.


1134
00:53:56.793 --> 00:53:58.420
The right can be a little racist,

1135
00:53:58.503 --> 00:54:00.171
and the left can be a little fascist.

1136
00:54:00.422 --> 00:54:02.382
And you can tell the Christians
by their guns,


1137
00:54:02.465 --> 00:54:05.051
and the liberals
by their hatred of free speech.


1138
00:54:05.719 --> 00:54:09.097
Is this what we're supposed to look--
Is this what we really are?


1139
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.892
Let's honestly look at all 50 states
and see what we've become.


1140
00:54:12.976 --> 00:54:14.185
Let's review.

1141
00:54:14.936 --> 00:54:16.604
We'll start with the northeast.

1142
00:54:17.105 --> 00:54:18.606
Start with Massachusetts.

1143
00:54:19.357 --> 00:54:21.693
Once the home of Sam Adams,

1144
00:54:22.152 --> 00:54:24.112
dumping tea into Boston Harbor.

1145
00:54:24.863 --> 00:54:26.948
Now the home of Fenway fans,

1146
00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:29.617
dumping Sam Adams
onto a Yankee outfielder's head.


1147
00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:35.623
New Hampshire
was once the freedom fighters.


1148
00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:38.001
Now it's a liquor store
for Massachusetts.


1149
00:54:40.545 --> 00:54:43.173
From "live free or die"
to "buy one, get one free."


1150
00:54:44.883 --> 00:54:47.135
Vermont was the Green Mountain Boys.

1151
00:54:47.218 --> 00:54:50.138
Now it's stoners that are lucky
we still like Ben & Jerry's.


1152
00:54:51.806 --> 00:54:53.600
Maine hasn't changed.

1153
00:54:53.808 --> 00:54:57.395
Still early risers
that think talking is for queers.


1154
00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.649
Rhode Island, the only state

1155
00:55:01.733 --> 00:55:03.693
where the governor
has a baseball bat in the trunk.


1156
00:55:05.653 --> 00:55:08.490
Connecticut used to be the enclave
of high society.


1157
00:55:08.573 --> 00:55:10.533
Now it's just a
good place to run fentanyl

1158
00:55:10.617 --> 00:55:12.118
from Montreal to the Midwest.

1159
00:55:14.454 --> 00:55:16.414
Pennsylvania, if you can't
throw a perfect spiral


1160
00:55:16.498 --> 00:55:18.917
by the time you're 12,
they make you put on a dress.


1161
00:55:21.169 --> 00:55:23.004
New York, once immigrants

1162
00:55:23.088 --> 00:55:25.423
waving documents to get into Ellis Island.

1163
00:55:25.757 --> 00:55:27.801
Now it's millennials waving fake IDs

1164
00:55:27.884 --> 00:55:29.135
to get into SantaCon.

1165
00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:34.891
New Jersey, a bad idea that continued.

1166
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:44.692
Maryland...

1167
00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.278
Maryland, you can't steal
everybody else's accent


1168
00:55:47.362 --> 00:55:49.572
and then combine them
and call that your accent.


1169
00:55:53.326 --> 00:55:55.161
Delaware.
[childishly] "We're a state!"


1170
00:55:55.245 --> 00:55:56.454
[cooing] "Yes, you are!"

1171
00:56:02.085 --> 00:56:03.503
Then we go to the South.

1172
00:56:04.796 --> 00:56:06.131
Mississippi.

1173
00:56:06.214 --> 00:56:07.924
It's 90 degrees every day.

1174
00:56:08.007 --> 00:56:09.968
How are you still 300 pounds?

1175
00:56:17.767 --> 00:56:19.435
Alabama, if it wasn't for football,

1176
00:56:19.519 --> 00:56:20.937
nobody would know who you are.

1177
00:56:22.856 --> 00:56:26.484
Louisiana, an open-container law
is not a culture.


1178
00:56:30.405 --> 00:56:31.531
Tennessee,

1179
00:56:31.614 --> 00:56:33.575
every time a country music star
gets her hair done,


1180
00:56:33.658 --> 00:56:35.118
a polar bear's house melts.

1181
00:56:38.538 --> 00:56:41.124
Kentucky, no matter what you accomplish,

1182
00:56:41.207 --> 00:56:42.500
when anyone says "hillbilly,"

1183
00:56:42.584 --> 00:56:44.002
we're all gonna think of you anyway.

1184
00:56:46.087 --> 00:56:48.381
Missouri, the "Show Me" state.

1185
00:56:48.464 --> 00:56:50.717
You can't call yourselves that

1186
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.635
and then have nothing to show us.

1187
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.102
Arkansas... Let me ask you
a question, Arkansas.


1188
00:57:01.186 --> 00:57:03.938
What would you do if Walmart
didn't have their headquarters there?


1189
00:57:04.606 --> 00:57:05.857
You'd be back to your old job

1190
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.276
of throwing pocketknives
at each other's feet all day.


1191
00:57:13.114 --> 00:57:16.242
Oklahoma, lose the rodeo.
You're embarrassing yourselves.


1192
00:57:17.994 --> 00:57:20.747
Texas, at this point
you're just cowboy cosplay.


1193
00:57:23.124 --> 00:57:25.335
You're as authentic as a mechanical bull.

1194
00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:28.755
You got the west.

1195
00:57:29.797 --> 00:57:32.675
Arizona, all sand and no beach.

1196
00:57:32.926 --> 00:57:34.594
That's a... That's a litter box.

1197
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:43.353
New Mexico, ugly Arizona.

1198
00:57:45.897 --> 00:57:47.357
California, we felt sympathy

1199
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.317
the first seven times you caught on fire.

1200
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.985
Now, it's starting to be your fault.

1201
00:57:56.533 --> 00:57:58.868
Nevada, the honest state.

1202
00:57:58.952 --> 00:58:00.245
They legalized prostitution. They're like,

1203
00:58:00.328 --> 00:58:01.955
"We know we have no natural resources,

1204
00:58:02.038 --> 00:58:03.623
but, hey, we'll blow you."

1205
00:58:08.628 --> 00:58:11.214
Colorado, you're rich, you're beautiful,

1206
00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:12.924
and you pretend to be down to earth.

1207
00:58:13.007 --> 00:58:15.927
Don't we already have a Gwyneth Paltrow
somewhere around here?


1208
00:58:17.762 --> 00:58:18.930
Utah...

1209
00:58:19.013 --> 00:58:21.307
Congratulations, Mormons.
You've done the impossible.


1210
00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:24.852
You are both exotic
and uncompelling at the same time.


1211
00:58:26.688 --> 00:58:28.398
Idaho, how are potatoes

1212
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:30.233
still your most fascinating quality?

1213
00:58:31.818 --> 00:58:34.112
Surrounded by steak
and you're a side dish.


1214
00:58:36.614 --> 00:58:37.824
Wyoming,

1215
00:58:37.907 --> 00:58:39.701
you peaked in 1870.

1216
00:58:41.327 --> 00:58:42.328
I don't know. We'll call you

1217
00:58:42.412 --> 00:58:44.664
if there's a Comanche raid
on the fort, I guess.


1218
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.418
You got the northwest.

1219
00:58:49.127 --> 00:58:50.169
Oregon...

1220
00:58:51.588 --> 00:58:53.798
On either side of them,
the age of computers


1221
00:58:53.881 --> 00:58:56.009
started on their front and back doorstep,

1222
00:58:56.092 --> 00:58:58.344
and they said,
"Let's open a sneaker store."


1223
00:59:03.474 --> 00:59:05.226
Washington, lose the attitude.

1224
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.770
You're not the independent
bookstore of states, okay.


1225
00:59:07.854 --> 00:59:10.273
You sent us serial killers, Starbucks,

1226
00:59:10.356 --> 00:59:11.441
and hipsters.

1227
00:59:11.524 --> 00:59:12.775
What are you gonna do for an encore,

1228
00:59:12.859 --> 00:59:14.319
put Hep C in your apples?

1229
00:59:17.572 --> 00:59:19.657
Montana, Big Sky Country.

1230
00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:20.992
I got bad news for you.

1231
00:59:21.075 --> 00:59:23.369
Everybody has a sky. 
It's not really...

1232
00:59:29.417 --> 00:59:32.670
North Dakota, the country's
creepy old uncle in the attic.


1233
00:59:35.506 --> 00:59:37.550
South Dakota, you seem stuck.

1234
00:59:38.176 --> 00:59:40.887
I don't know, maybe build a city.
Just throwing ideas out here.


1235
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:45.475
Wisconsin,

1236
00:59:45.558 --> 00:59:46.684
you're fat.

1237
00:59:51.022 --> 00:59:53.483
Minnesota, the blond leading the bland.

1238
00:59:55.568 --> 00:59:57.904
Michigan, no matter
how many times you ask,


1239
00:59:57.987 --> 01:00:00.531
nobody's coming back to Detroit. Drop it.

1240
01:00:04.744 --> 01:00:06.162
You have the heartlands.

1241
01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.039
Iowa,

1242
01:00:08.122 --> 01:00:11.209
the only state that needs
a Me Too movement for the cattle.


1243
01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:16.714
Nebraska,

1244
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:18.257
if the Midwest was a romcom,

1245
01:00:18.341 --> 01:00:20.093
they'd be the unmarried best friend.

1246
01:00:22.804 --> 01:00:24.639
Kansas, there's no place like home.

1247
01:00:25.348 --> 01:00:27.392
Unless your home is Kansas,
then there's no place...


1248
01:00:28.643 --> 01:00:30.395
No place like everyplace else.

1249
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.940
Indiana, whoever said blonds have more fun

1250
01:00:34.023 --> 01:00:35.358
must've never been to Indiana.

1251
01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:38.736
Why do all the point guards
look like Anne Heche?


1252
01:00:41.531 --> 01:00:42.824
Illinois...

1253
01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:44.742
"We're more than just Chicago."

1254
01:00:44.826 --> 01:00:46.077
Are you, though?

1255
01:00:49.831 --> 01:00:52.041
Ohio, the good middle child
of the country.


1256
01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:54.419
Reliable, responsible, relatable...

1257
01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:55.753
Replaceable.

1258
01:00:58.047 --> 01:00:59.507
You got the southeast.

1259
01:01:00.883 --> 01:01:03.386
Virginia, the snobs of the South.

1260
01:01:03.469 --> 01:01:05.763
Stop trying to be Connecticut,
you hayseed.


1261
01:01:08.683 --> 01:01:09.684
West Virginia.

1262
01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.394
Still riding them back roads,

1263
01:01:11.477 --> 01:01:14.105
making moonshine,
running from Johnny Law, huh?


1264
01:01:14.605 --> 01:01:18.317
The manufacture of alcohol
has been legal since 1931.


1265
01:01:19.402 --> 01:01:21.028
Why do you keep doing this?

1266
01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:27.410
The Carolinas, I call them
"the Carolinas" together


1267
01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:29.996
'cause you know how much
that pisses off North Carolina?


1268
01:01:31.038 --> 01:01:31.998
Just...

1269
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.085
They think they're better
than their brother.


1270
01:01:36.169 --> 01:01:38.379
They're like the Nick Jonas
of the Carolinas.


1271
01:01:41.466 --> 01:01:42.592
Georgia,

1272
01:01:42.675 --> 01:01:44.177
they shoot <i>The Walking Dead</i> there

1273
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.846
and they don't use sets.
What does that tell you about yourself?


1274
01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:54.270
And then Florida.

1275
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.564
Florida, you...

1276
01:01:57.356 --> 01:01:59.150
Florida, you bum.

1277
01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.988
You were...

1278
01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:07.492
You were supposed to be
the crown jewel of the east.


1279
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.161
And you're hanging around

1280
01:02:10.244 --> 01:02:12.163
sucking lithium out of car batteries.

1281
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.168
Let's not forget our stepchildren.

1282
01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.257
Hawaii,

1283
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:25.301
you're beautiful, but you're distant.

1284
01:02:26.511 --> 01:02:28.262
That's why nobody ever wants to spend
more than four days


1285
01:02:28.346 --> 01:02:29.722
lying down on top of you.

1286
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.268
And Alaska...

1287
01:02:34.727 --> 01:02:36.312
We left you alone too long
when you were young,


1288
01:02:36.395 --> 01:02:37.605
now you're a bit odd.

1289
01:02:40.483 --> 01:02:43.152
That's all 50 states right there. Right?

1290
01:02:43.236 --> 01:02:44.487
-Thank you.
-[cheering and whooping]


1291
01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:45.988
Thanks.

1292
01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.825
Thank you.

1293
01:02:52.578 --> 01:02:53.579
Thank you.

1294
01:02:55.122 --> 01:02:57.375
And nobody's happy.

1295
01:02:57.667 --> 01:03:00.378
I mean, we're supposed to be
the happy country,


1296
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:02.213
and nobody is happy.

1297
01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:05.258
Why? 'Cause we take everything too far.

1298
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:06.384
The extremes.

1299
01:03:06.467 --> 01:03:08.219
Republicans get too greedy.

1300
01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:09.846
Democrats get too needy.

1301
01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:12.348
The right wants to
go back to the 1950s.

1302
01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:15.226
The left reacts to everything
like it is the 1950s.


1303
01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:17.019
So, what are we gonna do?

1304
01:03:17.103 --> 01:03:19.230
We're either gonna... 
Bloody civil war?

1305
01:03:19.313 --> 01:03:20.314
Could happen.

1306
01:03:20.398 --> 01:03:21.482
We break up.

1307
01:03:21.566 --> 01:03:22.775
Or we could all just leave.

1308
01:03:22.859 --> 01:03:25.486
If no one's happy,
no one's keeping us here.


1309
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.280
Everybody go back where you came from.

1310
01:03:27.363 --> 01:03:28.489
Go back to Ireland.

1311
01:03:28.573 --> 01:03:30.950
You go back to wherever
your family's from, right?


1312
01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:32.785
That's what people do
when they get divorced.


1313
01:03:32.869 --> 01:03:34.453
Go back to their parents' house
and live there.


1314
01:03:36.372 --> 01:03:38.541
Sleep on the couch, eat ice cream, cry.

1315
01:03:40.418 --> 01:03:42.628
We just leave. But we leave,

1316
01:03:42.712 --> 01:03:45.798
no drama, no fighting, just quietly.

1317
01:03:45.882 --> 01:03:47.008
Just tiptoe out.

1318
01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:49.635
Like the last scene
in the movie <i>The Birds.</i>


1319
01:03:49.719 --> 01:03:50.761
Just leave...

1320
01:03:50.845 --> 01:03:53.598
The movie <i>The Birds,</i>I love that movie.
It reminds me of this country.


1321
01:03:53.681 --> 01:03:55.516
'Cause it's noisy, screaming.

1322
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.603
Birds tweeting, chirping. 
People yelling.

1323
01:03:58.686 --> 01:04:01.022
Little kids' birthday parties,
chocolate all over their face.


1324
01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:03.608
And then the last ten minutes,
just silence.


1325
01:04:04.025 --> 01:04:07.278
Nobody says a word.
Nobody utters a sound. That's what we do.


1326
01:04:07.361 --> 01:04:08.946
Empty this country out.

1327
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:10.031
Just leave.

1328
01:04:10.114 --> 01:04:11.991
No one will be left here...

1329
01:04:12.074 --> 01:04:15.745
except whatever Native American
tribes are still here.


1330
01:04:15.828 --> 01:04:18.164
Because this is their parents' house.
Where are they gonna go?


1331
01:04:19.749 --> 01:04:22.627
And they'll be standing there,
watching for a while.


1332
01:04:23.169 --> 01:04:25.379
Maybe a McDonald's bag will float by.

1333
01:04:27.006 --> 01:04:28.841
Finally one will turn to another and go,

1334
01:04:29.467 --> 01:04:30.843
"Was that the peyote?

1335
