Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:24.527
Hello, I am the ghost of Daniel Johnston.

3
00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:30.658
Many years ago I lived in Austin, Texas,

4
00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.662
and I worked at McDonald's.

5
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.919
It is an honor and a privilege

6
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.297
to speak to you today,

7
00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:51.387
to tell you about my condition,

8
00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:56.976
and the other world.

<i>Is it just a memory?</i>

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.768
<i>Or am I a little crazy for you?</i>

28

<i>MABEL JOHNSTON: He was different.</i>

29
00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:25.606
<i>I noticed that from the start
that Dan was different.</i>


30
00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.360
<i>I had him on a
crib in our little bedroom</i>

31
00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.821
<i>and I would go in and talk to him,
change his diaper,</i>


32
00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:35.450
<i>and I would squeal at him
and he would squeal back at me.</i>


33
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.287
That's a small baby communicating,
I thought


34
00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:43.499
Being, uh, six years younger
than his four brothers and sisters,


35
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.877
<i>he was pampered by them.</i>

36
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.546
<i>And, uh, they nursed him along.</i>

37
00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.965
<i>But we didn't notice at that time</i>

38
00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.343
<i>that there was any special talents involved
or anything.</i>


39
00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:58.139
MABEL: <i>When he went to school,
they tested the kids,</i>


40
00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:02.101
<i>and Dan was put in the highest group
of the highest class.</i>


41
00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:05.855
<i>His teacher was really mad at him
and it's understandable</i>


42
00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:08.524
<i>because Dan doesn't follow directions.</i>

43
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.903
<i>You know, when he was in junior high,</i>

44
00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:16.115
<i>he suddenly lost
all his wonderful confidence,</i>


45
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.036
<i>and I guess it was the beginning
of his illness.</i>


46
00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:25.291
BILL: <i>He and his brother
decided to make their own movie.</i>


47
00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:29.462
<i>And it was a collaborative effort
between the two brothers working together.</i>


48
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:33.883
And Dan had to change clothes
and pretend to be his mother.


49
00:03:34.342 --> 00:03:37.386
<i>Because his mother and I
weren't in the movie actually.</i>


50
00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:40.264
<i>Tell about it, Mabel.</i>

<i>portraying himself in parts</i>

53
00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:49.023
<i>and his horrible mother in other parts.</i>

54
00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.779
<i>I think he was having fun teasing me.
What do you think, Bill?</i>


55
00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:57.448
<i>BILL: Yeah, he... 
He was doing it for humor.</i>

56

<i>DANIEL: You are real lazy. Wake up.</i>

57

<i>MABEL". Dan's hard to deal with sometimes.</i>

58
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.248
<i>He thought, "I'm artistic.
I shouldn't have to do those things."</i>

that way?</i>

<i>He was a trial.</i>

71
00:04:44.203 --> 00:04:48.040
I was sort of the star art guy
at the high school.

of this new art guy, the new art star.</i>


74
00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:57.592
<i>You know, the new kid in town,
I had to find out who this was.</i>


75
00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:00.928
<i>A friend of mine told me,
"There's this kid, Dan Johnston,</i>

<i>"he can really draw,
he's a musician or something."</i>


77
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.184
<i>So he kind of had one up on me,
he was a musician.</i>


78
00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:08.519
<i>The guy is a natural, an absolute natural.</i>

79
00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:10.271
<i>He never even had to learn to draw.</i>

80
00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:12.940
<i>He just got better from great.</i>

81
00:05:13.232 --> 00:05:17.111
<i>You know, I had to hang outwith this guy.
I had to be around this art.</i>


82
00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:21.240
<i>So we just started hanging out
and doing art together, actually.</i>

<i>he was buying them for the artwork

He, for some reason,
thought he was going to be

his first six albums and saying,

744

and laying down on the bed
and we just both wept


745
00:45:32.023 --> 00:45:35.110
like he was dead, you know.
Because we didn't know who he was.

750
00:46:03.513 --> 00:46:05.932
I'm lying in bed. 
I have pneumonia.

751
00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:09.477
And the phone rings
and I have like a

752
00:46:09.561 --> 00:46:12.731
and somebody says,
"Do you know a Daniel Johnston?"


753
00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:14.316
I go, "Yeah, Daniel and I are friends."

754
00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:16.318
He goes,
"Well, I think maybe you should come here."


755
00:46:16.401 --> 00:46:18.320
I go,
"Well, I really don't think I should. I'm sick."


756
00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:20.196
"No. I really, really think
you should come here."


757
00:46:21.573 --> 00:46:24.576
I get to campus.
I have a 103 degrees temperature.


758
00:46:24.659 --> 00:46:27.245
It's 1986 and it's Christmas,
so there's nothing there.


759
00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:29.164
There's no cars. 
There's no people.

760
00:46:29.247 --> 00:46:33.084
This campus is completely empty.
It's weird. It's eerie. It's quiet.


761
00:46:33.168 --> 00:46:36.629
These people I don't know are
leading me down and we start walking down


762
00:46:36.713 --> 00:46:39.841
to go towards the river.
And we look over and there's the water.


763
00:46:39.924 --> 00:46:42.010
And there standing
in the middle of the water is Daniel.


764
00:46:42.093 --> 00:46:44.095
And he's standing in the water,
he's about knee-deep,


765
00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:47.640
splashing the water, and he's looking at us,
his eyes are like white.


766
00:46:47.724 --> 00:46:49.184
At one point he
looks up and starts singing,

<i>(SINGING) Running water, running water</i>

768
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.356
And then he's preaching.
And he's talking about baptism.


769
00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:56.775
And he's talking about evil.
He's really whacked.


770

We're trying to talk him

783

<i>I thought the military takeover

<i>But it didn't.

<i>I thought, I knew, I
saw. I knew, I saw.</i>

00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:39.067
<i>I went inside the building of U.T.</i>

787
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.653
<i>I saw... I saw the things, the programming,</i>

I'm talking like Nazi Germany.</i>


794
00:48:03.716 --> 00:48:05.093
All great artists are crazy,

795
00:48:05.176 --> 00:48:08.304
but there's a difference between
the abstract great artist being crazy


796
00:48:08.388 --> 00:48:11.307
and this person doing damage to you
or to himself,


797
00:48:11.391 --> 00:48:13.393
and how involved do you want to be?

798
00:48:14.394 --> 00:48:16.104
<i>We'd spent our whole lives,
we're those kind of people</i>


799

<i>who love the notion of the crazy artist.</i>

800
00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:19.190
<i>You know, Van Gogh cutting off his ear.</i>

801
00:48:19.274 --> 00:48:21.734
<i>And we've read those books
and we've, you know, collected the art</i>


802
00:48:21.818 --> 00:48:24.195
<i>and we've seen the movies
and we really loved the crazy people</i>


803
00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:25.488
<i>because they were the pure people.</i>

804
00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:27.782
<i>You know, they didn't have
any commercial sense.</i>


805
00:48:27.866 --> 00:48:29.826
<i>And yet, he was a real sick person.</i>

806
00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:32.745
<i>And it was really,
"What are we gonna do?"</i>

807
00:48:33.121 --> 00:48:35.248
And so, I mean, we do
the most pedestrian thing possible.


808
00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:36.291
We commit him.

809
00:48:36.374 --> 00:48:38.835
And you actually felt, I mean,
a certain amount of guilt.


810
00:48:38.918 --> 00:48:41.504
I mean, it was like,
if I was around Van Gogh...


811
00:48:41.588 --> 00:48:43.465
You know, I've always had contempt
for those people


812
00:48:43.548 --> 00:48:44.883
who didn't understand genius,

813
00:48:44.966 --> 00:48:46.968
and here I am given my shot
and what I'm saying is,


814
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:50.096
please put him in the hospital 'cause
we don't want to have to deal with him.


815
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.264
We don't know what to do.

816
00:48:51.347 --> 00:48:53.433
When I went to see him in the hospital,
they wanted to know


817
00:48:53.516 --> 00:48:55.101
what my relationship with Daniel was.

818
00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:57.520
And I had been working informally
as his publicist.


819
00:48:57.604 --> 00:49:00.982
But I needed to tell them something
a little better than that.


820
00:49:01.065 --> 00:49:02.650
And I assumed that Randy Kemper,

821
00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:05.487
after having been beat over the head
with a lead pipe


822
00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.655
did not want to continue managing Daniel.

823
00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.741
So I said I was his manager.

824
00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:12.535
<i>I helped get Daniel out of the hospital</i>

825
00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:15.163
<i>because I didn't fully understand
why he was there.</i>


826
00:49:15.246 --> 00:49:17.290
<i>All I knew was he
needed to get out of there.</i>

827
00:49:17.373 --> 00:49:20.668
<i>And as soon as I did get him out, I began
hearing from other people asking me,</i>


828
00:49:20.752 --> 00:49:22.503
<i>Why did I do that.</i>

829
00:49:22.587 --> 00:49:24.505
<i>But it seemed like he was doing
well enough.</i>


830
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:26.007
<i>He was back in his home.</i>

831
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:29.886
<i>And it seemed like everything was okay,
although it was very borderline.</i>


832
00:49:30.303 --> 00:49:32.722
It's like true in science fiction and

833
00:49:32.805 --> 00:49:35.475
it's the new supernatural age,

834
00:49:35.808 --> 00:49:37.644
<i>you know, they spoke of 'm Revelations.</i>

<i>And Number nine, number nine,

836

talk about the Devil before,</i>


840
00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:55.536
<i>and he became so obsessed
that it was all he could talk about.</i>

<i>my immediate fear was that
he's gonna kill himself.</i>


857

1329

<i>And we sat in the waiting room,</i>

1331
01:18:46.808 --> 01:18:50.311
<i>Daniel came out, and we had a business
meeting for about 30, 45 minutes,</i>

<i>They were looking out
for Daniel's best interests.</i>


1338
01:19:09.997 --> 01:19:13.751
<i>There was a clause in there about his
mental health, about providing a doctor,</i>


1339
01:19:13.835 --> 01:19:15.920
<i>about how he would never have to tour,</i>

1340
01:19:16.003 --> 01:19:19.632
<i>about how he could never be dropped
for failure to promote a record.</i>


1341
01:19:19.715 --> 01:19:21.801
<i>And they looked at
it as a long-term project.</i>

1342
01:19:21.884 --> 01:19:24.887
<i>It wouldn't be just one record,
it would be a career.</i>


1343
01:19:25.388 --> 01:19:29.434
<i>It was probably the most one-sided contract
in the favor of artists' rights</i>


1344

<i>that had ever been drawn up,

1345

get him out of the hospital.</i>


1346

Daniel continued to improve,</i>

when he would be released.</i>


1350

<i>Yves Beauvais of Atlantic Records
contacted me around that time,</i>

1361

<i>Once Daniel was released from the hospital,
I was trying to get help for him.</i>


1362
01:20:25.865 --> 01:20:29.327

to make doctor's appointments for him.</i>

He did not want to see the doctor.</i>


1364

<i>And Elektra wanted him to sign this contract</i>

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.293
<i>and Daniel was paranoid about that.</i>

1366
01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.087
He was afraid that Elektra was Satanic.

1367

called Metallica.

He was convinced that Elektra was evil
and that I was evil.


1373
01:21:04.195 --> 01:21:07.281
Elektra had to be evil

Daniel started listening to The Beach Boys,
like, after we played Pet Sounds for him.


1470
01:26:26.559 --> 01:26:27.643
I think.

1471
01:26:27.768 --> 01:26:30.938
He said he never heard Pet Sounds before,
but we played it for him one night


1472
01:26:31.021 --> 01:26:32.064
and he was floored by it.

1473
01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:35.317
And so he went out and bought like
every Beach Boys record

1481
01:27:11.937 --> 01:27:16.191
I read the story of Brian Wilson
that he wrote himself.

1506
01:29:14.476 --> 01:29:18.689
<i>the possibility existed, sad as it was,
that he might never produce anything again.</i>


1507
01:29:18.772 --> 01:29:21.400
<i>And a lot of the
music that he had recorded</i>

1508

<i>was, to the general populous, unlistenable.</i>

1509
01:29:24.653 --> 01:29:28.157

never get him and he would just be</i>
