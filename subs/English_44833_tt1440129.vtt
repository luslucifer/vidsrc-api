00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.461
<i>Today really</i>
<i>marks the first stage</i>


2
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.919
<i>of an unprecedented</i>
<i>technological advancement.</i>


3
00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:38.261
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.


4
00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:41.051
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun


5
00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:42.344
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

6
00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:45.306
<i>If a planet's too far away</i>
<i>from its sun, it's too cold.</i>


7
00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.061
<i>If it's too close to</i>
<i>its sun, it's too hot.</i>


8
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.314
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,</i>
<i>the distance is just right.</i>


9
00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.987
<i>Potentially perfect</i>
<i>for sustaining life.</i>


10
00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.158
We have finally managed
to identify one planet


11
00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.912
<i>that is the right distance</i>
<i>from its star to hold water</i>


12
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.911
<i>and is the right mass</i>
<i>to sustain an atmosphere.</i>


13
00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.995
<i>Every 24 hours,</i>
<i>our station in Hawaii</i>


14
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:12.800
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat</i>
<i>7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>


15
00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:17.095
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet


16
00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:21.430
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.


17
00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:24.682
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here


18
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:27.810
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.


19
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.732
Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.448
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.


21
00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:37.782
Start transmission.

22
00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.263
<i>Lt seems as though</i>
<i>NASA is setting up shop</i>


23
00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.147
<i>right here in</i>
<i>our own backyard.</i>


24
00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:12.355
<i>Today, the Beacon International</i>
<i>Project was launched.</i>


25
00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.482
<i>Satellite dishes</i>
<i>here on Oahu</i>


26
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.690
<i>sending out very powerful</i>
<i>signals into deep space</i>


27
00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:20.070
<i>with an attempt to</i>
<i>communicate with anyone...</i>


28
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.697
Another round,
birthday boy.


29
00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:23.494
<i>...or anything that</i>
<i>might be out there listening.</i>


30
00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:24.905
A toast.

31
00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:26.331
Happy birthday,
little brother.


32
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:29.831
I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.


33
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.458
May this be
a great year for you.


34
00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:34.005
It's going to
be a great year.


35
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.129
I love you.
I love you, too.


36
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.096
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,


37
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.428
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.


38
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.051
Johnny.

39
00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:49.437
"Adversity is
the state in which man


40
00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:51.856
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself


41
00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:55.527
"being especially free
of admirers then."


42
00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.854
Cheers.

43
00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:59.022
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.277
It's a very
good quote for you.


45
00:04:00.357 --> 00:04:02.985
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?


46
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:04.285
Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.658
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.


48
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.163
Did you get me that?

49
00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:08.660
Yes, I got you that.

50
00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:10.166
Thank you,
that's very sweet.


51
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.709
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.


52
00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:18.300
I got this guy, Tony. He said he
can get you a construction job.


53
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:19.627
All you need to
do is call him.


54
00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:22.387
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?


55
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.639
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:25.928
You're not going
to call him, are you'?


57
00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.726
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you


58
00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.679
or Tony's help,
for that matter.


59
00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:33.394
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.


60
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.893
No.
Great. All right.


61
00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.484
Happy birthday. Blow out
your candle and make a wish.


62
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.325
Do not waste
a wish on a girl.


63
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.494
Wish for a job,
an apartment.


64
00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:48.117
A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.


65
00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:50.574
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.


66
00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:54.248
It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:56.170
All right?

68
00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:58.169
Please don't waste it.

69
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:02.465
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?


70
00:05:02.544 --> 00:05:03.545
I'm going in.
You're not going in.


71
00:05:03.628 --> 00:05:04.971
How do I look?

72
00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:06.889
Wait, let me
just fix that.


73
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:08.133
Awesome!

74
00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:09.593
All right, princess,
go get 'em.


75
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:15.853
Great start.

76
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.857
Ugh.

77
00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:24.278
What seems to
be the problem?


78
00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.443
I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.654
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

80
00:05:28.737 --> 00:05:30.535
Lt ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.


81
00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:32.958
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

82
00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:35.289
What's your name?

83
00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:36.874
I'm hungry-

84
00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:39.255
That's not your name.

85
00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:44.052
If you give me five minutes

86
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.304
I will get you
your chicken burrito.


87
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.429
Five minutes,
starting now.


88
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.893
Chicken burrito time, I'm out.

89
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.641
Chicken burrito,
roger that.


90
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.152
Wait! Hi!

91
00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.111
No! Let's just...

92
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:08.239
Just one twist of the key
and we will be good.


93
00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:09.615
How are you, ma'am?

94
00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:11.913
How you doing?
Burritos, right there.


95
00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:14.036
It's closed.
Too late, pal.


96
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.416
Okay.

97
00:06:15.492 --> 00:06:16.789
It's right there. Please?

98
00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:19.747
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.


99
00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:21.172
$3.99...

100
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.184
Chicken burrito.

101
00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:22.855
I got it!

102
00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:24.607
Hey! Freeze!

103
00:07:32.694 --> 00:07:34.492
I got a burrito!
I got it!


104
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:35.572
Freeze!

105
00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:39.876
Stay down!

106
00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.416
He's getting back up!

107
00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.769
I've had it!
Look at yourself!


108
00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:08.855
How is it that you
screw everything up?


109
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.489
By the way, that girl you were
trying to impress last night,


110
00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:15.870
do you know who
her father is?


111
00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:17.071
Admiral Shane!

112
00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:19.411
He runs the whole damn fleet!

113
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.040
So, now you're messing
with my job. My life!


114
00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.959
You know that girl?

115
00:08:26.623 --> 00:08:27.624
The burrito girl?

116
00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.801
I've always stayed out of
your business, haven't I?


117
00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.128
Because I was hoping
that maybe one day


118
00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:33.555
you would learn
from your mistakes.


119
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.382
You would grow up,
you would mature a bit!


120
00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:37.138
Is my back all right?

121
00:08:38.843 --> 00:08:40.641
Oh, my God! My back!

122
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.223
You're 26, and what have you got?
You got, what?


123
00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:44.979
Sixty-five dollars
to your name?


124
00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:46.230
I got tazed.

125
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:48.653
A car that doesn't start.
You're living on my couch!


126
00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:51.489
Those things work!

127
00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.316
Man, look at yourself.

128
00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:55.906
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:57.658
As from now,

130
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.664
as from right this second, there
is a new dynamic at play.


131
00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:02.416
And this dynamic
is the following.


132
00:09:02.492 --> 00:09:04.745
From here on, until I state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,


133
00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:07.331
no more discussion,
no more compromise!


134
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:11.088
It's me speaking, you listening.
Me saying, you doing.


135
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.094
Do you understand that?

136
00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.305
It's time for
a new course of action.


137
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.678
A new direction.

138
00:09:18.508 --> 00:09:20.226
A game change.

139
00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.729
You are joining
me in the Navy.

171
00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:09.619
One minute left.

179

<i>And by "contact," you</i>

180
00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:34.856
You all right?

181
00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:36.028
Yeah, I'm fine.

182
00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:37.738

Bronson!

186
00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:45.321
What do you mean, "Bronson"?
No, negative.


187
00:11:45.488 --> 00:11:46.740
I'm fine. Bronson,
you're gonna take this.


188

Do you want to die?


191
00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:55.919
Good choice.

192
00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:57.591
He is definitely concussed.

193
00:11:58.376 --> 00:12:00.253
You just threatened
one of my sailors.


194

196

<i>I'm skeptical that</i>
<i>Hopper is 100 percent.</i>


197
00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.812
Engage, engage.
Impose will, impose will.


198
00:12:09.887 --> 00:12:12.515
There are two kinds
of idiots, Hopper.


199
00:12:12.682 --> 00:12:14.559
One looks where he kicks,

200
00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:17.274
the other looks
where he doesn't kick.


201
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.068
Which idiot are you?

202
00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:24.028
I'm the idiot that's going to kick
it through your keeper's face.


203
00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:25.536
Get ready for overtime.

Are you sure?

220
00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:46.697
Never been more sure

What are you going to say?

222
00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:50.280

225
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.868
My words.

226

242
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.769
Hopper, let's go, come on.
Hopper!


243
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:40.222
This way.

244
00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.979
No, no, no.

245
00:15:42.058 --> 00:15:43.105
That way, sir.

246
00:15:43.184 --> 00:15:44.356
Yes, yes,
I knew that.


247
00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:45.732
We knew that.
You look good.


248
00:15:45.895 --> 00:15:48.023
<i>The U. S. S. Missouri</i>

250
00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:51.742
before being de-commissioned
and replaced


251
00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.535
with a more modern
fleet of vessels,


252
00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:55.204
like destroyers.

253
00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.791
What's the difference between
a battleship and a destroyer?


254
00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.369
Battleships are great ships.

255
00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:03.166
But they are kind
of like dinosaurs.


256
00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:06.340
They're designed to take hits,
like a floating punching bag.


257
00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:09.009
But then there's destroyers,
which are just awesome.


258
00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:12.092
They're designed to dish it
out like the Terminator.


259
00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:13.964
Are you a Captain?

260
00:16:14.048 --> 00:16:17.143
No, he's not a Captain because
he's always late. Come on.


261
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:18.928
<i>L fight the ship.</i>

262
00:16:19.428 --> 00:16:21.226

00:16:26.268 --> 00:16:28.362
Listen, get it done.
Get it done.


264

I was within the rules.
Really?


308
00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:46.204
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?


309
00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:48.456
Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?


310
00:18:48.536 --> 00:18:49.788
He hates the man.

311
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.918
That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say'?


312
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:53.754
Go mess with him
and see what happens.


313
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.175
Why?
- Do it.


314
00:18:55.251 --> 00:18:56.844
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?


315
00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:58.136
Would that be funny?
Stop it.


316
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.969
Chicken.
Kentucky Fried Chicken.


317
00:19:01.131 --> 00:19:02.974
Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.


318
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.802
You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.


319
00:19:04.885 --> 00:19:06.011
He was a handsome man.

320
00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:08.309
Good job out there, Dad.

321
00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:09.811
What do you want?

322
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.767
Hopper needs five
minutes of your time.


323
00:19:13.644 --> 00:19:14.861
That's enough.
What do you mean?


324
00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:17.235
Don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?


325
00:19:17.314 --> 00:19:18.611
Three minutes, tops.

326
00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:21.243
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.


327
00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:22.866
Love you, too.

328
00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:24.322
He's going to
smash my face in.


329
00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:25.748
He's not going to
smash your face in.


330
00:19:29.285 --> 00:19:30.787
Oh, my God.

331
00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:39.924
Sir, it would be an honor.

332
00:19:40.838 --> 00:19:43.557
Sir. Sir. Sir.

333
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.227
Give me your permission.

334
00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:49.146
It would be an honor
to have your permission.


335
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.019
Sir, give me your permission.
What's your deal?


336
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.562
It would be a thankful honor

337
00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:56.612
to have your permission
to honor your hand.


338
00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:58.026
What?

339
00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.899
Oh, my God.

340
00:20:03.193 --> 00:20:04.365
Sir.

341
00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:07.618
May I please
marry your daughter?


342
00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.747
She's everything I have,

343
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.628
and I love her.

344
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:17.333
Talking to yourself,
Mr. Hopper?


345
00:20:20.127 --> 00:20:22.175
Yeah, I was.

346
00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:24.973
I was actually talking
about you, Nagata.


347
00:20:28.218 --> 00:20:29.344
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:20:35.351 --> 00:20:37.524
That's for
kicking me in the face.


349
00:20:38.687 --> 00:20:42.442
Eat it! Take it!
Let go! Let go.


350
00:20:43.192 --> 00:20:44.785
What the...

351
00:20:50.658 --> 00:20:55.289
Sir, it was a fluke accident.
The bathroom floor was wet.


352
00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.956
I began to fall.

353
00:20:57.039 --> 00:21:00.509
Captain Nagata kindly
reached out to help.


354
00:21:00.668 --> 00:21:02.090
Our heads go bang.

355
00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:04.547
We fall back.
Bang, again.


356
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.349
Just like the great
Jerry Lewis.


357
00:21:07.424 --> 00:21:08.471
Jerry Lewis?

358
00:21:08.592 --> 00:21:10.139
Did he just say
"Jerry Lewis"?


359
00:21:10.219 --> 00:21:11.220
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:12.646
Are you kidding me?

361
00:21:13.055 --> 00:21:17.105
<i>The Bellboy and original</i>
<i>The Nutty Professor.</i>


362
00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:18.815
Very good movies.

363
00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:20.521
He is a great
humanitarian, sir.


364
00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:25.409
You both think this is a joke
and you are very much mistaken.


365
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:28.324
This will not happen again.
Do I make myself clear?


366
00:21:28.404 --> 00:21:29.747
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.


367
00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:34.001
Gentlemen, give me a minute
with Mr. Hopper, here.


368
00:21:43.377 --> 00:21:46.221
What is wrong with you?

369
00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:53.888
You've got skills, but I have never
ever seen a man waste them like you.


370
00:21:56.724 --> 00:22:00.194
"Keep the ship out of
the surf and spray..."


371
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:02.943
"...or you will
plunge to destruction."


372
00:22:03.772 --> 00:22:04.898
Homer, sir.

373
00:22:08.277 --> 00:22:13.158
The fact that you know that
infuriates me beyond words.


374
00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:19.959
What my daughter sees in you
is a great mystery to me.


375
00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.712
You are a very
smart individual


376
00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:27.297
with very weak character, leadership
and decision-making skills.


377
00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:32.138
Do you have anything
to say to me? Anything?


378
00:22:39.808 --> 00:22:41.651
Negative, sir.

379
00:22:45.522 --> 00:22:48.617
Enjoy these naval
exercises, Hopper.


380
00:22:48.776 --> 00:22:51.370
They are likely
to be your last.


381
00:22:51.528 --> 00:22:52.950
Dismissed.

382
00:22:57.701 --> 00:22:58.918
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>I can do to help?</i>


383
00:22:59.203 --> 00:23:00.250
Negative.

384
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:01.421
If you want to
talk about anything...


385
00:23:01.497 --> 00:23:02.498
I don't.

386
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:04.959
If you change your mind...
I won't.


387
00:23:06.668 --> 00:23:07.669
Roger that.

388
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.956
Contact DESRON ONE. Commence
anti-submarine warfare exercises.


389
00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:40.540
Commence air operations.

390
00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:02.725
Good afternoon, Sampson.

391
00:24:02.891 --> 00:24:05.770
<i>Welcome to Day One of</i>
<i>the RIMPAC naval war games.</i>


392
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:07.938
<i>We are here to sharpen</i>
<i>our skills as a team.</i>


393
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.692
As your
weapons officer,


394
00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:15.621
let me remind you
that this is a combat vessel


395
00:24:15.696 --> 00:24:20.122
and we will excel
in our command and control.


396
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.037
<i>I want everyone</i>
<i>to stay frosty.</i>


397
00:24:23.203 --> 00:24:25.706
We're going to be close-maneuvering
with 13 nations out here.


398
00:24:25.914 --> 00:24:29.009
We are here to
crush every other ship.


399
00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:30.590
I'm excited to
see what we learn.


400
00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:33.847
We are not here in this
weapons room to learn.


401
00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:37.976
Be safe out there, look out for
each other and keep charging.


402
00:24:38.135 --> 00:24:39.387
If we return to Pearl

403
00:24:39.469 --> 00:24:43.645
without having outperformed
every other ship on that ocean,


404
00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:44.976
I will personally...

405
00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:47.527
Yo, Saunders, we've ended
up in a department


406
00:24:47.603 --> 00:24:51.278
run by some kind of Donald
Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.


407
00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:53.483
What was that,
Petty Officer Raikes?


408
00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:54.568
Nothing, sir.

409
00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:58.326
I swear you said, "Donald
Trump." Want to clarify?


410
00:24:59.615 --> 00:25:01.788
I think I heard a "Mike
<i>Tyson," as well.</i>


411
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.328
If you did, it was only
in reference to the fact


412
00:25:04.411 --> 00:25:07.711
that you both project
great physical intensity, sir.


413
00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:09.333
That's flattering.

414
00:25:10.083 --> 00:25:12.302
Hopper! There's a helo
headed for the Sampson.


415
00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:13.758
Make sure your
ass is on it.


416
00:25:13.837 --> 00:25:15.384
Why?
I don't know why!


417
00:25:15.464 --> 00:25:16.761
Just make sure
you're on it!


418
00:25:16.924 --> 00:25:18.346
Copy, sir.

419
00:25:19.593 --> 00:25:20.640
Damn.

420
00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:24.397
<i>Scorpion one four, clear our deck.</i>
<i>En route with parts and techs.</i>


421
00:25:24.473 --> 00:25:26.942
<i>Confirm</i>
<i>Lieutenant Hopper en route.</i>


422
00:25:43.951 --> 00:25:45.373
I just got off
the phone with the JAG.


423
00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:46.953
And?

424
00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.714
They are probably going to
kick you out of the Navy.


425
00:25:55.045 --> 00:25:56.137
When?

426
00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:57.635
The day we get back.

427
00:25:57.798 --> 00:25:58.799
From RIMPAC?

428
00:25:58.882 --> 00:26:00.054
Yeah.

429
00:26:02.719 --> 00:26:05.268
You have got to make some calls.
There has got to be...


430
00:26:05.347 --> 00:26:07.395
Who do I call to
teach you humility?


431
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.195
I am sorry,
I don't have that number.


432
00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:17.276
I just don't get it, man.

433
00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:20.238
You have got so
much potential.


434
00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:23.832
I'm sorry you have
to deal with this.


435
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:31.544
And I am sorry
I let you down.


436
00:27:21.757 --> 00:27:22.804
Stand up nice and tall.

437
00:27:22.883 --> 00:27:24.351
I want you to focus
on that green marker,


438
00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:25.518
right in the middle
of your back.


439
00:27:25.594 --> 00:27:27.096
What do you think
I'm paying attention to?


440
00:27:27.888 --> 00:27:29.014
Keep your
feet together.


441
00:27:29.097 --> 00:27:30.770
My feet can't
get any closer.


442
00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:32.768
Stand up tall. All right.
I had enough of this.


443
00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:34.520
Keep going.
Just a little bit more.


444
00:27:34.603 --> 00:27:35.946
Turn the damned thing off!

445
00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:37.147
Come on.
We're just about there.


446
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.607
Turn it off now!

447
00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:41.736
I'm your new
physical therapist.


448
00:27:45.947 --> 00:27:47.699
I am sensing
a lot of anger.


449
00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:49.743
Very perceptive of you.

450
00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:54.127
Is there anything besides
anger in there, Mick?


451
00:27:55.415 --> 00:27:57.213
Not much.

452
00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:03.974
Your last therapist says that
you lost the will to fight.


453
00:28:04.758 --> 00:28:06.431
Is that accurate?

454
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.980
I lost my fight
when I lost my legs.


455
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.282
Do you realize you're still the same
man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?


456
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.990
A Bronze Star in Afghanistan?
The same man.


457
00:28:25.153 --> 00:28:27.201
I am half a man.

458
00:28:27.364 --> 00:28:30.459
And half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.


459
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:34.046
That's all I have ever known.

460
00:28:37.874 --> 00:28:40.297
All right. Let's go.

461
00:28:41.294 --> 00:28:42.511
We are going
to take a walk.


462
00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:43.634
No, we are not.

463
00:28:43.713 --> 00:28:45.181
Legs on.

464
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:50.975
You're doing pretty good for a
guy who doesn't want to be hiking.


465
00:28:51.054 --> 00:28:53.148
My dog, Mustard,
could climb this mountain.


466
00:28:53.306 --> 00:28:56.355
Great, you and Mustard can go and
make some memories on Mauna Kea.


467
00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:57.903
Sounds like fun.

468
00:28:57.978 --> 00:29:01.482
Mustard's dead. Mustard
got hit by a dump truck.


469
00:29:02.315 --> 00:29:03.441
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.700
I'm over it.

471
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:12.872
Hey. I thought you would
be out of range by now.


472
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.414
I have around
five minutes of left time.


473
00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:17.914
<i>How is it?</i>

474
00:29:17.998 --> 00:29:19.090
It's fine.

475
00:29:26.214 --> 00:29:28.717
I'm sorry. I messed up.

476
00:29:29.217 --> 00:29:32.938
<i>And I'm going to talk to your</i>
<i>father as soon as I get back.</i>


477
00:29:33.597 --> 00:29:36.066
Stop messing things up, okay?

478
00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:38.522
Copy that. I love you.

479
00:29:39.102 --> 00:29:40.649
I love you.

480
00:30:09.424 --> 00:30:11.518
What is it, Parker?
Take a look at this.


481
00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:18.475
Nice one.
It's a joke, right?


482
00:30:21.144 --> 00:30:22.612
I don't think so.

483
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.038
My God.

484
00:30:43.792 --> 00:30:44.884
Cal.

485
00:30:48.004 --> 00:30:49.176
Cal.

486
00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.263
Huh? Cal!

487
00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:55.020
Got some weird activity
on all the radar screens.


488
00:30:55.095 --> 00:30:56.187
Weird?

489
00:30:56.263 --> 00:30:57.810
Yeah, man. Really weird.

490
00:30:58.557 --> 00:30:59.558
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.566
Oh, uh, Dr. Nogrady is
on the phone for you, too.


492
00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:07.278
That is weird.
Seriously, Dr. Nogrady?


493
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.659
Lead with that next time.
Okay, Danny?


494
00:31:09.818 --> 00:31:11.786
You got to start
prioritizing your information.


495
00:31:11.945 --> 00:31:14.448
If you have to tell me "1,

496
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:15.748
You know what I mean?

497
00:31:15.824 --> 00:31:18.703
I mean, I'm not saying
that you are a boob,


498
00:31:18.785 --> 00:31:21.379
but this is
boob-ish behavior.


499
00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:24.416
Hi, Dr. Nogrady.

500
00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:25.876
<i>Are you seeing</i>
<i>what I am seeing?</i>


501
00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:27.419
The incoming tracks.

502
00:31:27.502 --> 00:31:28.503
<i>Correct.</i>

503
00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:32.387
I've got five
distinct objects...


504
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:36.895
<i>Five distinct objects</i>
<i>that are moving in formation.</i>


505
00:31:37.053 --> 00:31:40.398
They are locked
in on my signal.


506
00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:42.271
They are headed
straight for me.


507
00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:43.526
<i>Correct.</i>

508
00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:46.029
Maybe we should call NASA.

509
00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:49.191
<i>NASA have called us. They're</i>
<i>on the phone right now.</i>


510
00:31:50.483 --> 00:31:52.201
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Mr. Zapata.</i>


511
00:31:53.028 --> 00:31:54.120
<i>NASA?</i>

512
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:09.169
We are tracking something
splintering off of the main group.


513
00:32:09.336 --> 00:32:13.057
That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.


514
00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:23.150
Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.


515
00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.152
Yes, we have checked. It's not the
Russians, it's not the Chinese.


516
00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.528
Maybe we should
call the Air Force,


517
00:32:27.604 --> 00:32:29.322
because they might want
to fuel up their jets.


518
00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:31.074
<i>The Air Force</i>
<i>is online.</i>


519
00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:35.078
It appears the event
is headed your way.


520
00:32:35.236 --> 00:32:36.579
Prepare yourself.

521
00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:40.834
<i>Roger that. How would you suggest</i>
<i>that I prepare myself} sir?</i>


522
00:32:41.701 --> 00:32:42.998
Brace.

523
00:33:47.016 --> 00:33:48.859
<i>Let's all be seated.</i>

524
00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:52.317
I am hoping somebody here
can explain this to me.


525
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.825
Mr. Secretary, four of the five
objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.


526
00:33:55.984 --> 00:33:57.986
The fifth one appeared
to have broken apart


527
00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.946
making significant
contact with Hong Kong,


528
00:34:00.113 --> 00:34:01.706
but other places
were also affected.


529
00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:04.288
Scotland, Germany,
France, even Iowa.


530
00:34:04.451 --> 00:34:05.577
So, what is it?

531
00:34:05.744 --> 00:34:08.293
Sir, at this point we are working
on a couple of theories.


532
00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:09.418
And you are who, sir?

533
00:34:09.956 --> 00:34:11.299
I am with NASA.

534
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:14.215
What is NASA present
in this room for?


535
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.764
<i>We are looking</i>
<i>at the very real possibility</i>


536
00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:25.518
<i>that this is legitimate</i>
<i>extraterrestrial contact.</i>


537
00:34:26.681 --> 00:34:30.777
<i>It appears that it originated</i>
<i>from the Gliese solar system.</i>


538
00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:32.646
<i>Home of Planet G.</i>

539
00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:36.567
You are saying that
we sent out a signal


540
00:34:36.733 --> 00:34:39.907
and we got back
an alien response?


541
00:34:53.583 --> 00:34:55.711
<i>Sir, we just</i>
<i>got word from Pearl.</i>


542
00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:57.262
<i>They believe whatever made</i>
<i>impact with Hong Kong,</i>


543
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.093
has also made impact
with the Pacific Ocean.


544
00:34:59.547 --> 00:35:00.764
Where in the Pacific?

545
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:04.770
Approximately 150 miles south
of where we are right now, sir.


546
00:35:04.928 --> 00:35:08.603
It should be right there, but
we are not seeing anything.


547
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.563
Get me the Sampson.
Yes, sir.


548
00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:21.069
Base course, 2-2-0. Speed, 25.

549
00:35:28.076 --> 00:35:29.578
Captain on the bridge!

550
00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.846
<i>As casualty reports come in,</i>

551
00:35:39.921 --> 00:35:42.720
<i>it's still unclear exactly what</i>
<i>it was that hit Hong Kong.</i>


552
00:35:49.222 --> 00:35:51.645
<i>It isn't anything</i>
<i>from this planet.</i>


553
00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:53.814
<i>How do we know that?</i>

554
00:35:53.893 --> 00:35:55.520
Because the Chinese
have sampled it.


555
00:35:56.271 --> 00:36:00.026
<i>It's made of a material that does</i>
<i>not exist in the periodic table.</i>


556
00:36:00.441 --> 00:36:02.443
It's literally
not of this Earth.


557
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.204
The only element they've been
able to identify is lawrencium.


558
00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:07.115
<i>Lawrencium?</i>

559
00:36:09.576 --> 00:36:10.543
You got to stop tapping.

560
00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:12.120
You're tapping.
You're the loud one.


561
00:36:12.287 --> 00:36:13.334
<i>Looking at</i>
<i>the grid patterns,</i>


562
00:36:13.413 --> 00:36:14.756
<i>it's something in</i>
<i>the neighborhood</i>


563
00:36:14.914 --> 00:36:17.633
<i>of solar paneling</i>
<i>or communications paneling.</i>


564
00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:20.136
It may be some kind of
a communication unit.


565
00:36:21.504 --> 00:36:23.381
<i>Communications?</i>

566
00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:26.684
<i>Who is communicating what?</i>
<i>To who?</i>


567
00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:37.145
What the heck is that?

568
00:36:37.645 --> 00:36:40.148
Bridge, starboard lookout. I've
got an unknown surface contact.


569
00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:44.161
Bearing is 2-3-2 true,
approximately 8,000 yards.


570
00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:50.499
Sir?

571
00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:51.576
Yeah.

572
00:36:51.659 --> 00:36:52.911
You may want to come
take a look at this.


573
00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.920
I am looking at it,
Mr. Strodell.


574
00:36:55.663 --> 00:36:57.040
On the radar, sir.

575
00:36:57.498 --> 00:36:59.000
Something very peculiar.

576
00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.468
That's the
John Paul Jones, right?


577
00:37:01.544 --> 00:37:02.545
Yes, sir.

578
00:37:02.629 --> 00:37:05.007
<i>The Myoko?</i>
<i>Yes, sir, it is.</i>


579
00:37:05.298 --> 00:37:07.016
So, why don't I see...

580
00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:08.810
See that?

581
00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:16.727
Combat, Captain. I have a visual on the
track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.


582
00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:18.312
<i>What do you hold</i>
<i>in that bearing?</i>


583
00:37:18.394 --> 00:37:20.396
Bridge, TAO.
I've got nothing at 2-3-7.


584
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:22.774
I'm looking right at it, Mr. Hopper.
Find me something.


585
00:37:22.899 --> 00:37:26.244
Scope, 2-3-7, what do you got?
Stand by.


586
00:37:26.986 --> 00:37:29.205
That's negative, sir.
Scope's clear, I got nothing.


587
00:37:29.364 --> 00:37:30.616
Taylor, did you break
this son-of-a-bitch?


588
00:37:30.782 --> 00:37:33.126
No, I didn't do
anything to it, sir.


589
00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:34.999
You know I will throw
your ass off this ship.


590
00:37:35.078 --> 00:37:36.079
I know you will, sir.

591
00:37:36.245 --> 00:37:38.213
Got it, sir.
On my camera.


592
00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:39.750
What is it?

593
00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:41.384
I don't know.

594
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.139
Is this some
kind of exercise?


595
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.557
Probably.

596
00:37:48.716 --> 00:37:52.437
Unknown vessel in the vicinity of

597
00:37:52.595 --> 00:37:55.064
<i>and 1-5-9 degrees,</i>
<i>3-3 minutes west.</i>


598
00:37:55.223 --> 00:37:56.645
<i>Request you</i>

<i>with my vessel</i>
<i>on VHF channel 16,</i>


600
00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.645
and identify yourself, over.

601
00:38:00.728 --> 00:38:03.277
<i>John Paul Jones, this is</i>
<i>Sampson, Charlie Oscar.</i>


602

<i>John Paul Jones,</i>
<i>Charlie Oscar.</i>


603
00:38:04.899 --> 00:38:07.527
I would like you to send a team
over and take a closer look.


604
00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:09.788
No problem. We will get a
team in the water right away.


605
00:38:09.862 --> 00:38:10.988
Roger.

606
00:38:11.072 --> 00:38:14.246
I'll tell you what, boys,
this is a head-stumper.


607
00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:44.739
What is it?
Lost cargo? Chinese?


608
00:38:45.857 --> 00:38:46.949
I don't know.

609
00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:50.120
Yacht? Satellite?

610
00:38:50.903 --> 00:38:55.454
Beast, I didn't know five seconds
ago, and I don't know now.


611
00:38:57.118 --> 00:38:59.917
<i>This is the U. S. Navy warship</i>
<i>John Paul Jones.</i>


612
00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:03.003
<i>I'm attempting to</i>
<i>communicate with you.</i>


613
00:39:06.961 --> 00:39:08.634
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

614
00:39:33.654 --> 00:39:34.826
You ever seen
anything like this?


615
00:39:35.698 --> 00:39:36.745
No.

616
00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:39.585
It's weird, man.

617
00:40:12.151 --> 00:40:15.325
LT! I don't think
that's a good idea.


618
00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:18.367
Got it, chief.

619
00:40:41.097 --> 00:40:42.724
Real bad idea, Lieutenant.

620
00:40:48.604 --> 00:40:50.277
Oh, shit.
Move it, Raikes!


621
00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:52.567
LT!
Lieutenant, get up!


622
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.696
Lieutenant!

623
00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:06.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

624
00:41:21.929 --> 00:41:22.930
Sir!

625
00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:33.278
Get me the Sampson.

626
00:41:33.608 --> 00:41:35.827
<i>Alpha Bravo.</i>
<i>Sampson, this is Alpha Bravo.</i>


627
00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.119
Sir, we're unable to
contact the Sampson.


628
00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:47.130
<i>Reagan control, this is</i>
<i>Rough Rider 4-0-4.</i>


629
00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:49.378
<i>I'm encountering</i>
<i>some severe...</i>


630
00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.761
Rough Rider 4-0-4, come in.
Do you copy'?


631
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.598
Put the force at weapons posture one.
Warning red, weapons tight.


632
00:41:59.759 --> 00:42:01.432
I want everything loaded.

633
00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:10.903
Bridge,
what's happened?


634
00:42:10.978 --> 00:42:12.480
My radar's totally down, sir.

635
00:42:12.647 --> 00:42:15.070
We've lost contact with base.
All comms are offline.


636
00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:16.947
It's the North Koreans,
I'm telling you.


637
00:42:18.945 --> 00:42:20.788
Hey, Lieutenant, you good?

638
00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:22.327
Come on, you with me?

639
00:42:23.115 --> 00:42:24.833
Come on. Damn it!

640
00:42:25.159 --> 00:42:26.661
Come on! Squared away?

641
00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:27.745
I'm squared away.

642
00:42:27.828 --> 00:42:29.671
Whatever that thing is,
it killed the battery.


643
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.877
Come on, Beast.

644
00:42:34.877 --> 00:42:36.129
What is that?

645
00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.099
That's not good.

646
00:43:01.529 --> 00:43:02.872
What the hell is that?

647
00:43:31.392 --> 00:43:33.770
Do you think that
this could be some


648
00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:37.448
super-secret Navy
surprise exercise?


649
00:43:38.232 --> 00:43:40.985
Because if so, they
have gone way too far.


650
00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:56.588
Let's give them
a warning, Helmsman.


651
00:43:56.917 --> 00:43:58.260
Aye, aye, sir.

652
00:44:54.975 --> 00:44:56.818
What the hell is this?

653
00:44:57.186 --> 00:44:59.939
I didn't sign up for this bullshit!
Yeah, no shit, dude.


654
00:45:00.022 --> 00:45:01.649
Klyvich is offline. Should
be back in two minutes.


655
00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.235
Copy that.
Signal the John Paul Jones.


656
00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:07.997
<i>Fire a warning shot. One</i>
<i>round, ten mil, left offset.</i>


657
00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:11.250
Place Mount 51 in remote,
batteries released.


658
00:45:11.325 --> 00:45:12.998
<i>Mount 51 has been designated.</i>

659
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.709
Who are we shooting at?
I do not know.


660
00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:18.507
- Let's move it, Beast.
- She's dead in the water.


661
00:45:21.502 --> 00:45:22.970
Ord, get your ass
to the lee helm.


662
00:45:23.045 --> 00:45:24.513
Aye, sir.

663
00:45:25.965 --> 00:45:27.842
Fire!

664
00:46:08.674 --> 00:46:11.143
<i>Incoming, headed for</i>
<i>the John Paul Jones.</i>


665
00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:13.555
Unknown, inbound
at the horizon.


666
00:46:13.721 --> 00:46:15.519
Vampire, vampire, vampire.
Killing with CIWS.


667
00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.080
What kind of
chuckwagon...


668
00:46:36.243 --> 00:46:37.369
Were there men out
on that bridge wing?


669
00:46:37.453 --> 00:46:39.000
Yes, sir, there were.

670
00:46:40.956 --> 00:46:42.754
I got it! Firing it up!

671
00:46:44.084 --> 00:46:45.586
Get in there!

672
00:46:45.753 --> 00:46:46.879
Sir!

673
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.717
Light it up!

674
00:46:58.098 --> 00:46:59.350
What the hell
is Hopper doing?


675
00:46:59.433 --> 00:47:00.650
All engines, ahead flank.

676
00:47:00.726 --> 00:47:02.728
All engines ahead.
Aye, sir!


677
00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:14.869
Sir, CIC reports both Spy and Fire
control radar cannot lock on.


678
00:47:22.998 --> 00:47:24.625
Fire!
CIC, fire!


679
00:47:32.675 --> 00:47:33.767
Incoming on the right!

680
00:47:37.096 --> 00:47:38.723
Incoming, incoming!

681
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:40.432
We're hit!

682
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.578
Sir, we have
a hull breach.


683
00:48:05.583 --> 00:48:06.709
Help me!

684
00:48:08.836 --> 00:48:10.804
Helmsman, get back on the helm!
Aye, sir.


685
00:48:10.963 --> 00:48:12.306
Rapid, continued fire!

686
00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.240
No!

687
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.644
<i>Get me to the</i>
<i>John Paul Jones.</i>


688
00:49:08.062 --> 00:49:09.188
NOW!

689
00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:14.364
<i>Bridge reports no survivors</i>
<i>in the water. Sampson, all hands lost.</i>


690
00:49:14.526 --> 00:49:16.620
<i>Targets are holding</i>
<i>defensive formation.</i>


691
00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:19.536
Where's the captain?
Where is he?


692
00:49:19.698 --> 00:49:21.496
What happened? OFFICER:
Captain and XO are dead.


693
00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:22.785
What?

694
00:49:22.868 --> 00:49:25.917
They're dead!
CO and XO are dead.


695
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.127
Who's in charge?

696
00:49:30.626 --> 00:49:32.003
Who's next full senior?

697
00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:33.428
You are.

698
00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:41.646
It's your ship, sir.
You're senior officer, sir.


699
00:49:46.225 --> 00:49:48.068
Sir, if you would please
just give me an order.


700
00:49:48.143 --> 00:49:49.895
I don't know
what to do, sir.


701
00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:04.919
We're going in.
Full attack.


702
00:50:05.703 --> 00:50:07.125
That's an order.

703
00:50:07.329 --> 00:50:09.206
Attack, sir? Really?

704
00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.421
You wanted an order,
that's the order. Let's go.


705
00:50:11.792 --> 00:50:12.964
Let's go!

706
00:50:13.127 --> 00:50:15.471
You heard him.
- Aye, aye, sir!


707
00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.221
Ready all guns.

708
00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:22.728
Fire control is offline.
I need three minutes.


709
00:50:29.143 --> 00:50:30.941
Tell Nagata I'm going in,
with or without him.


710
00:50:37.317 --> 00:50:38.364
Sir, do you really
want to attack this thing?


711
00:50:38.485 --> 00:50:40.579
Yes! Yes, I do.

712
00:51:01.049 --> 00:51:02.722
Sir, that's a hit!
<i>The Myoko was hit, sir.</i>


713
00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:03.932
Are the weapons ready?

714
00:51:04.052 --> 00:51:05.554
Sir, they have killed everything
that's fired on them.


715
00:51:05.637 --> 00:51:07.105
Get the guns online,
and we ram this thing.


716
00:51:07.181 --> 00:51:09.479
They killed my brother
and every man on his ship!


717
00:51:15.522 --> 00:51:17.320
We have no weapons
to attack with, sir.


718
00:51:18.317 --> 00:51:19.990
Then set course to 3-1
-O.

719
00:51:20.152 --> 00:51:22.029
That's a collision course!
Are you clear on that'?


720
00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:27.326
Sir, there are
sailors in the water.


721
00:51:27.493 --> 00:51:29.712
Get the guns online and we're
going to ram this thing!


722
00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:37.177
<i>Sir, the Myoko is sinking!</i>

723
00:51:37.252 --> 00:51:39.675
Sir, please!
Set the course to 3-1-O.


724
00:51:40.172 --> 00:51:42.971
There are sailors
in the water, sir!


725
00:51:57.606 --> 00:51:58.823
Hard starboard.

726
00:51:58.899 --> 00:52:00.071
Hard starboard. Aye, sir!

727
00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.406
Get them out of the water.

728
00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.490
Yes, sir.

729
00:52:25.926 --> 00:52:27.428
What's happening?

730
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.097
Shut up, man.
What the hell is happening?


731
00:52:30.264 --> 00:52:32.938
What the hell are they doing?
Why aren't they attacking?


732
00:52:42.818 --> 00:52:43.990
Are those
things aliens?


733
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:45.571
Would you please shut up?

734
00:52:45.654 --> 00:52:47.656
We need help! We need
to get the carrier over here!


735
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.793
Who's running the ship?
Hopper.


736
00:52:51.952 --> 00:52:53.875
Are you kidding me?
Hopper's running the ship?


737
00:52:53.954 --> 00:52:55.046
This is bullshit.

738
00:52:55.122 --> 00:52:56.123
We're all going to die!

739
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.723
What the hell
are those things?


740
00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:09.686
What is that shit?

741
00:53:20.647 --> 00:53:22.820
<i>Comms are down up here.</i>
<i>You got anything?</i>


742
00:53:22.983 --> 00:53:24.656
<i>That's a negative</i>
<i>on all frequencies.</i>


743
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:44.178
Oh, shit.

744
00:53:56.808 --> 00:53:57.855
Abandon 9-30!

745
00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:22.547
Kill the engines!

746
00:54:54.574 --> 00:54:55.575
Strike!

747
00:55:11.383 --> 00:55:12.930
Hey, Jack!

748
00:55:24.479 --> 00:55:25.526
Dad?

749
00:56:08.482 --> 00:56:10.155
Sir,
I can't explain this.


750
00:56:10.275 --> 00:56:11.993
We've lost communication
with everyone


751
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:13.742
on the other side
of the barrier.


752
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.573
We can't get in and
they can't get out.


753
00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:21.624
The field, whatever it is,
extends about 300,000 feet in altitude


754
00:56:21.787 --> 00:56:23.460
and has a depth of
about two nautical miles.


755
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.003
We are in contact with
Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet.


756
00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:28.962
Right now, our navy is effectively
trapped outside the area.


757
00:56:29.127 --> 00:56:30.504
So we have nobody in there?

758
00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:34.387
Sir, we have three guided missile
destroyers still unaccounted for.


759
00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:37.762
So, it's conceivable
we do have somebody inside.


760
00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:38.975
Who?

761
00:56:53.068 --> 00:56:54.911
Okay. Thank you!

762
00:56:56.863 --> 00:56:58.911
Captain! Captain!

763
00:57:03.036 --> 00:57:04.788
Let's go! Let's go!

764
00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:48.206
My grandmother could
climb this mountain.


765
00:57:48.373 --> 00:57:49.545
It's a start, Mick.

766
00:57:54.963 --> 00:57:55.964
What was that?

767
00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.975
I'm not sure.

768
00:58:40.342 --> 00:58:41.468
What the hell are you
guys doing up here?


769
00:58:41.635 --> 00:58:43.353
I need you off this
mountain, right now.


770
00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:44.728
Wait, what's going on? Why?

771
00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:45.935
The island's under attack.

772
00:58:46.014 --> 00:58:47.015
Attack by who?

773
00:58:47.098 --> 00:58:48.975
I don't know. People are
using the word "aliens."


774
00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.192
Aliens?

775
00:58:51.228 --> 00:58:53.731
We don't know. Whatever it is,
it took out the marine base


776
00:58:53.813 --> 00:58:55.986
and all roads leading to this
mountain have been destroyed.


777
00:58:56.149 --> 00:58:59.744
Cell phones, radios, Internet,
everything is shut down.


778
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:02.497
The Navy's engaged,
just off of the coast.


779
00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:03.619
The Navy?

780
00:59:03.698 --> 00:59:06.497
I need you and your friend off
of this mountain right now.


781
00:59:08.161 --> 00:59:09.253
Come on, let's go.

782
00:59:09.329 --> 00:59:11.798
Vic, leave your car here.
We'll go block the road.


783
00:59:26.263 --> 00:59:27.731
Where are you going?

784
00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:31.560
Mick! Where are you going?

785
00:59:31.643 --> 00:59:35.693
I ain't never seen an alien.
Have you ever seen an alien?


786
00:59:36.064 --> 00:59:38.988
Mick! Don't leave me alone.

787
00:59:48.576 --> 00:59:50.704
Bra, you saw that?
What the hell was that?


788
00:59:51.663 --> 00:59:53.085
Hey, Vince,
did you see that?


789
00:59:53.248 --> 00:59:54.465
<i>Lt looked like a jet</i>

790
00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:55.750
Bra, I've never...

791
00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.555
Oh, my God! What the hell?

792
01:00:26.948 --> 01:00:28.245
Sir, we need you.

793
01:00:29.576 --> 01:00:31.249
We need you now.

794
01:00:32.078 --> 01:00:33.375
I can't.

795
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.047
If you can't...

796
01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.505
Who can?

797
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.092
Captain.

798
01:01:26.674 --> 01:01:28.847
Where did we find it?

799
01:01:28.927 --> 01:01:30.429
One of their
transporters must have crashed


800
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:32.765
on the way to the island.
There was debris everywhere.


801
01:01:32.847 --> 01:01:35.350
Thomas and Potts fished him right out
of the water with a grappling hook.


802
01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:37.645
I told them it was a bad
idea, but they kept yanking.


803
01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:39.484
I kept telling them "no,"
and they kept...


804
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.941
Hmm...

805
01:02:07.966 --> 01:02:08.967
Oh...

806
01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:16.933
God damn it!

807
01:02:24.899 --> 01:02:26.196
Beast, flashlight.

808
01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:33.204
My dad said they would come.
He said it my whole life.


809
01:02:36.327 --> 01:02:37.544
He said, "We ain't alone."

810
01:02:39.205 --> 01:02:40.923
He said, "One day
we would find them,


811
01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:44.837
"or they would find us."

812
01:02:47.338 --> 01:02:49.181
You know what else he said?

813
01:02:51.843 --> 01:02:53.345
He said...

814
01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.064
"I hope I ain't around
when that day comes."


815
01:03:01.394 --> 01:03:03.396
He's not dead!
He's not dead!


816
01:03:04.105 --> 01:03:05.823
Not dead! Not dead!

817
01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.557
I've got a bad
feeling about this.


818
01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:22.934
What kind of bad feeling?

819
01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:26.901
Like, "We're going to need a new
planet" kind of bad feeling.


820

<i>Medical</i>

822
01:04:34.529 --> 01:04:35.655
Lock down the ship!

01:05:30.168 --> 01:05:31.420
Did you see it?

830
01:05:31.544 --> 01:05:33.546
No, sir.
I got nothing, sir!


831
01:05:33.838 --> 01:05:35.465
Nothing.

832
01:05:36.215 --> 01:05:37.262

01:05:37.342 --> 01:05:38.468
Not good, sir. Not good.

837
01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:09.934

843
01:09:11.597 --> 01:09:13.224
Raikes, you better be there.

844
01:09:22.817 --> 01:09:24.285

We got to get
off this mountain.


847
01:10:32.845 --> 01:10:35.018
The cop left the keys
on his belt.


848

You've got to go
down and get them.


849
01:10:41.354 --> 01:10:43.356
You can do it.

850
01:12:17.283 --> 01:12:18.330
Now.

851
01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:31.799
This is an emergency call.
Can anyone hear me?


852
01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:35.803
Radio check.
Can anyone hear me? Over.


853
01:12:35.968 --> 01:12:37.561
Hey, wait up!
Don't leave! Don't leave!


854
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.063
Stop right there!
Don't shoot!


855
01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.313
Who are you?

856
01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.892
I'm Cal Zapata.
We sent out a beacon.


857
01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:47.567
Oh, shit, is he a cyborg?
Are you guys with them?


858
01:12:55.029 --> 01:12:57.999
If he's human, could you
have him put the gun down?


859
01:12:58.157 --> 01:12:59.329
Mick,
put your gun down.


860
01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:01.001
I told them that something
like this could happen.


861
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.003
I said, it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians,


862
01:13:03.162 --> 01:13:04.755
or the Conquistadors
and the Incans.


863
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.878
They just thought,
"No, they will be sweet."


864
01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:09.510
They killed my grad student.

865
01:13:12.713 --> 01:13:14.715
Okay, calm down.
I can't.


866
01:13:14.882 --> 01:13:17.385
Slow. Sit down.
I can't breathe.


867
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:18.803
Slow breaths,
slow breaths.


868
01:13:19.386 --> 01:13:20.558
You're freaking
him out, Mick.


869
01:13:20.638 --> 01:13:22.732
I doubt it takes
much to freak him out.


870
01:13:23.307 --> 01:13:26.026
We need the Marines. We need the Army.
We need all of them.


871
01:13:27.645 --> 01:13:30.114
<i>Lt is the strong</i>
<i>belief of the Chinese</i>


872
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:31.281
<i>that what crashed</i>
<i>into Hong Kong</i>


873
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.035
<i>was some sort of</i>
<i>communications ship.</i>


874
01:13:35.194 --> 01:13:39.370
You're saying that
a flying telephone cratered


875
01:13:39.532 --> 01:13:41.705
and took out 25,000 people?

876

<i>What I'm saying is that our visitors</i>
<i>seem extraordinarily concerned</i>


877
01:13:45.329 --> 01:13:47.878
<i>with establishing a line</i>
<i>of communication home.</i>


878
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.293
If they have lost their communication
ship, how could they do that?


879
01:13:50.376 --> 01:13:51.502
<i>The same way we did.</i>

880
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:54.339
<i>Our communications station</i>
<i>in Hawaii has the ability</i>


881
01:13:54.421 --> 01:13:58.016
<i>to send a message to deep space</i>
<i>via the Landsat 7 satellite.</i>

<i>I believe it's for that asset</i>

<i>We're looking at</i>
<i>an extinction-level event.</i>


884
01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:12.524
The most critical part
of any military operation.


885
01:14:12.606 --> 01:14:16.736
Establish communications,
reinforcements, follow-on forces.


886
01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:18.704
You're saying E.T.
wants to phone home?


887
01:14:19.738 --> 01:14:22.082
That would be incredibly,
incredibly bad.


888
01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:24.786
So far, only five ships
have made contact.


889
01:14:24.952 --> 01:14:27.330
If five ships can do this,
what do you think 50 can do,


890
01:14:27.413 --> 01:14:30.292
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?

891
01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.439
<i>Sir, if I could</i>
<i>just have a minute.</i>


892
01:14:49.602 --> 01:14:51.104
If you'll just
give me one second...


893
01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:54.902
Why am I staring
at a lizard?


894
01:14:54.982 --> 01:14:57.030
Because this is my pet lizard, sir.
Penelope the Third.


895
01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:59.662
And? And they have
the exact same eyes.


896
01:14:59.737 --> 01:15:00.863
You have 15 seconds. Go.

897
01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:03.703
Okay, sir,
I put the helmet on,


898
01:15:03.782 --> 01:15:05.910
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.


899
01:15:06.076 --> 01:15:08.704
And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,


900
01:15:08.787 --> 01:15:10.039
and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.


901
01:15:10.122 --> 01:15:13.171
But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.


902
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.220
She went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.


903
01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:18.506
You see? I don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.


904
01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.971
You try anything else on?

905
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.932
Negative, sir.

906
01:15:24.094 --> 01:15:26.313
Just the helmet.
Just the helmet.

It only orbits into range
once every 24 hours.


929
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.807
When is the satellite
in position?


930
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:53.892
8:43 a.m.

931
01:16:54.059 --> 01:16:55.276
We've got about five hours.

932
01:16:55.352 --> 01:16:57.980
And then they will use it to
slingshot their transmission.


933
01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:59.356
Slingshot where?

934
01:16:59.565 --> 01:17:01.818
I don't know.
Wherever it is they're from.


935
01:17:08.198 --> 01:17:10.701
Pearl Harbor here,
we're approximately here,


936
01:17:10.868 --> 01:17:13.417
and they, whatever they are,
are somewhere in the middle.


937
01:17:13.579 --> 01:17:14.922
We're trapped out here.

938
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.878
What we know right now
is we can't target them


939
01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:18.630
unless we have
a plain line of sight.


940
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:21.258
Without radar, we have no
way to track them, correct?


941
01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:25.262
Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.


942
01:17:25.424 --> 01:17:27.677
Why?
Because we are still alive.


943
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.104
Okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.


944
01:17:30.262 --> 01:17:32.356
And we have no way to hit
them from a safe distance.


945
01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.943
There is a way.
A way?


946
01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.771
A way of seeing them,
without seeing them.


947
01:17:38.937 --> 01:17:41.031
You're going to reference Art
<i>of War right now, aren't you?</i>


948
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.067
What are we supposed to do, fight
the enemy where they aren't?


949
01:17:43.275 --> 01:17:44.527
Move like water?

950
01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.866
Because I've read that thing six times.
It makes no sense.


951
01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.531
That book is Chinese.

952
01:17:50.574 --> 01:17:51.951
It still makes no sense.

953
01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.628
My way is much more simple.

954
01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.582
We've been doing it to
America for 20 years.


955
01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:01.176
Water displacement.

956
01:18:01.335 --> 01:18:03.133
How do you track
water displacement?


957
01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.798
Tsunami buoys.
Tsunami buoys?


958
01:18:07.132 --> 01:18:08.725
You have them
surrounding your islands,


959
01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:10.644
transmitting
displacement data.


960
01:18:10.803 --> 01:18:13.306
We hack into their
transmissions, form a grid.


961
01:18:13.472 --> 01:18:15.099
You can't track
anything without radar.


962
01:18:15.182 --> 01:18:17.025
I don't need radar.

963
01:18:17.643 --> 01:18:19.395
Just the radio frequencies.

964
01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:21.780
Turn off Aegis radar, please.

965
01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:25.151
Who is this guy?

966
01:18:25.442 --> 01:18:27.240
Chief Moore.
- Sir.


967
01:18:27.653 --> 01:18:28.745
Secure SPY.

968
01:18:28.946 --> 01:18:29.993
Securing SPY, sir.

969
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:36.669
Display NOAA data.

970
01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.007
NOAA data?

971
01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:42.509
That's correct.

972
01:18:44.044 --> 01:18:46.422
You heard him.
Display NOAA data.


973
01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:54.521
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

974
01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.143
<i>It's a buoy.</i>

975
01:18:56.849 --> 01:19:00.899
<i>If it gets hit by a wave,</i>
<i>it transmits a signal.</i>


976
01:19:08.193 --> 01:19:09.945
Bring up chart plot.

977
01:19:11.697 --> 01:19:13.244
Chart plot. Bring it up.

978
01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:28.468
So we can track
without radar.


979
01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:31.930
We would practice it
as a contingency plan.


980
01:19:32.092 --> 01:19:35.141
You dirty,
cheating, sneaky...


981
01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:36.726
Rough world.

982
01:19:38.098 --> 01:19:39.315
I like it.

983
01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.352
Captain.

984
01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.155
My chair is your chair, sir.

985
01:20:02.247 --> 01:20:04.670
My brother would
have done the same.


986
01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.635
I wish we could
get a hold of Hopper.


987
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.052
Who's Hopper?

988
01:20:15.135 --> 01:20:16.887
He's a tactical
actions officer


989
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:18.813
on an Arleigh Burke
class destroyer.


990
01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:23.486
It has the resources that could
take this entire mountain out.


991
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.359
Great, that makes a lot of sense.
Let's call him.


992
01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:28.115
We can't.
Everything is jammed.


993
01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:31.152
They're using an electromagnetic
field to block our signals.


994
01:20:31.318 --> 01:20:35.619
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
There are gaps, okay?


995
01:20:35.781 --> 01:20:38.204
From inside the barrier we might
just be able to get a call out.


996
01:20:38.283 --> 01:20:40.911
If I could get to my spectrum
analyzer, then, theoretically,


997
01:20:41.078 --> 01:20:42.625
we could find a frequency
we could broadcast on...


998
01:20:42.788 --> 01:20:46.133
Do you have a piece of equipment
that can make a call?


999
01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:48.293
Yeah.
Get it.


1000
01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:52.715
I can't because it's down
there, in that nest of aliens.


1001
01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.474
You're going to go get it.

1002
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:55.551
No.

1003
01:20:55.634 --> 01:20:57.136
Yes.
- Yes.


1004
01:21:03.433 --> 01:21:06.562
We are looking for patterns
of water displacement.


1005
01:21:26.498 --> 01:21:27.670
That buoy
is underwater.


1006
01:21:37.676 --> 01:21:39.599
That's a ship.

1007
01:21:39.678 --> 01:21:41.806
Get on your gun.
Yes, sir.


1008
01:21:55.861 --> 01:21:57.454
Target, Echo-1-1.

1009
01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.740
Roger. Echo 1-1.

1010
01:22:00.532 --> 01:22:01.658
Ready to fire.

1011
01:22:01.742 --> 01:22:05.372
When we fire,
they will know where we are.


1012
01:22:18.383 --> 01:22:19.384
Fire!

1013
01:22:44.534 --> 01:22:45.535
Ordy, anything?

1014
01:22:45.619 --> 01:22:47.462
<i>Negative, sir.</i>
<i>It's a miss.</i>


1015
01:22:54.086 --> 01:22:55.884
It's heading towards us.

1016
01:22:59.383 --> 01:23:00.430
You ready?

1017
01:23:01.802 --> 01:23:05.648
I'm sorry, but there is no possible
way that I'm going down there.


1018
01:23:05.722 --> 01:23:07.645
I do not possess
that kind of courage.


1019
01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:10.561
Right now, you're going
to acquire that courage,


1020
01:23:10.727 --> 01:23:13.606
or I'm going to break my
steel leg off into your ass.


1021
01:23:15.816 --> 01:23:17.159
You feel me?

1022
01:23:18.235 --> 01:23:19.828
I feel you.

1023
01:23:19.986 --> 01:23:22.284
Go, now.

1024
01:23:23.657 --> 01:23:25.455
Acquiring courage.

1025
01:23:26.743 --> 01:23:28.416
Acquiring courage.

1026
01:24:58.794 --> 01:24:59.795
What?

1027
01:25:06.885 --> 01:25:08.182
Foxtrot, 2-4.

1028
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:09.387
Foxtrot, 2-4.

1029
01:25:09.554 --> 01:25:10.771
Ready to fire.
Fire!


1030
01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:22.864
Ordy, anything?

1031
01:25:23.026 --> 01:25:24.152
<i>Negative, sir.</i>

1032
01:25:24.236 --> 01:25:26.159
It's a stupid,
nincompoop idea.


1033
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:34.208
There's another one.

1034
01:25:53.807 --> 01:25:56.401
<i>Incoming, incoming! Sir,</i>
<i>they're coming from both directions!</i>


1035
01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.655
Engines, back, full.

1036
01:26:12.784 --> 01:26:14.707
Incoming, incoming, incoming!

1037
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.472
India 3-7.

1038
01:26:26.756 --> 01:26:28.429
India 3-7. Loaded.

1039
01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:31.018
Second coordinate,
Romeo, 2-6.


1040
01:26:31.094 --> 01:26:32.141
Romeo 2-6.

1041
01:26:36.182 --> 01:26:38.651
Sir, we're hot over here.
Missiles good to go.


1042
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:40.483
Let's light them up,
Captain Nagata.


1043
01:26:51.489 --> 01:26:52.786
Captain Nagata.

1044
01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.579
Fire!

1045
01:27:28.693 --> 01:27:30.445
Holy shit!
A hit, sir! Hit!


1046
01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:40.589
<i>Any station this net, any station</i>
<i>this net, this is a call for help.</i>


1047
01:27:40.747 --> 01:27:44.797
<i>Any warship, police or military</i>
<i>personnel, please respond, over.</i>


1048
01:27:45.377 --> 01:27:46.924
<i>This is U. S.S.</i>
<i>John Paul Jones,</i>


1049
01:27:47.003 --> 01:27:48.300
<i>state your identity</i>
<i>and position. Over.</i>


1050
01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.552
Hopper?

1051
01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:50.632
Sam?

1052
01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:52.468
<i>Sam, are you okay?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>


1053
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:54.143
Thank God. I'm okay.

1054
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:59.725
Listen, they're here at the satellite
array at Saddle Ridge, do you copy?


1055
01:28:00.725 --> 01:28:03.569
<i>They're going to transmit a signal</i>
<i>and establish communication.</i>


1056
01:28:03.728 --> 01:28:07.403
You need to destroy the facility.
We have four hours.


1057
01:28:07.565 --> 01:28:08.908
Four hours, I copy.

1058
01:28:13.113 --> 01:28:14.239
Hopper.

1059
01:28:16.074 --> 01:28:17.200
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1060
01:28:19.619 --> 01:28:21.462
Babe, you need to
get out of there.


1061
01:28:21.746 --> 01:28:24.169
Hopper? Hopper?

1062
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.718
No, they're gone.
They're gone.


1063
01:28:26.918 --> 01:28:28.215
We better
get gone, too.


1064
01:28:28.378 --> 01:28:29.880
I'm thinking an Arleigh
Burke class destroyer


1065
01:28:29.963 --> 01:28:32.557
is about to rain hell
down on this mountaintop.


1066
01:28:43.727 --> 01:28:45.070
Are you ready to
kill another one?


1067
01:28:49.733 --> 01:28:50.950
Tango 1-9.

1068
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:53.783
Tango 1-9. Loaded.

1069
01:28:57.657 --> 01:28:58.783
Whiskey 2-5.

1070
01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:00.293
Whiskey 2-5.

1071
01:29:08.501 --> 01:29:10.003
Raikes, can you get
a track on their ship?


1072
01:29:10.086 --> 01:29:12.214
Negative, sir, it's
moving all over the place.


1073
01:29:12.297 --> 01:29:14.299
I can't get a line on it.

1074
01:29:26.436 --> 01:29:27.813
This sucker's
really jumping around.


1075
01:29:28.605 --> 01:29:29.982
Very intelligent.

1076
01:29:39.491 --> 01:29:40.959
What time is sunrise?

1077
01:29:41.034 --> 01:29:42.661
Forty minutes, sir.

1078
01:29:43.369 --> 01:29:45.838
Let's take these bastards
somewhere they don't want to go.


1079
01:29:49.667 --> 01:29:51.044
<i>General quarters,</i>
<i>general quarters.</i>


1080
01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:52.549
<i>All hands, man</i>
<i>your battle stations.</i>


1081
01:29:53.505 --> 01:29:56.054
I need to know when we round this
point if we can hold her tight.


1082
01:29:56.132 --> 01:29:57.634
Right around
Diamond Head, here.


1083
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.188
There's
a brutal current there.


1084
01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.186
It will take a miracle
to keep her off the reef.


1085
01:30:07.352 --> 01:30:09.195
Ordy, is it possible?
Can you do it?


1086
01:30:09.354 --> 01:30:10.571
It's not impossible.

1087
01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:12.323
Sir, I can try,
but I don't know what...


1088
01:30:12.398 --> 01:30:13.695
Can you do it,
yes or no?


1089
01:30:17.195 --> 01:30:19.948
Contact is seven miles out,
and closing fast.


1090
01:30:20.115 --> 01:30:21.492
Yes, sir, I can do it.

1091
01:30:21.866 --> 01:30:23.709
Check safe, check clear.
Check safe, check clear.


1092
01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:25.002
Get some.

1093
01:30:25.328 --> 01:30:27.296
Captain Nagata,
how good is your aim?


1094
01:30:27.372 --> 01:30:28.715
Excellent.

1095
01:30:31.876 --> 01:30:33.878
- All right, let's start this turn!
- Aye, sir!


1096

Left, hard rudder!
Left, hard rudder, sir!


1097
01:30:40.385 --> 01:30:41.682
How are we looking?
It's all reef.


1098
01:30:43.388 --> 01:30:45.265
Ordy, you are way
too close! Come left!


1099
01:30:45.348 --> 01:30:46.349
Easy...

1100
01:30:47.225 --> 01:30:49.774
We're about to kiss
these rocks, Ordy!


1101
01:30:49.853 --> 01:30:50.979
Ordy!

1102
01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:01.160
Where did you
learn to shoot?


1103
01:31:01.239 --> 01:31:03.241

- Still a little tight.


1107
01:31:10.415 --> 01:31:12.509
I can see fish, Ordy.
Come on, man.


1108
01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.669

Are you kidding me?

1115
01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:30.481
Here we go.

1116
01:31:40.028 --> 01:31:41.245
On my mark.

1120
01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:02.096
Light them up.

1121
01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:22.032

Sir.

1126
01:32:55.019 --> 01:32:57.613
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge!


1127
01:33:09.033 --> 01:33:10.159
Shit!

1128
01:33:43.526 --> 01:33:46.746
Ordy, get up! Let's go!

1129
01:33:48.072 --> 01:33:49.699
Go, go, go!

1130
01:33:54.912 --> 01:33:56.164
We've got

1131
01:33:56.247 --> 01:33:57.373
Get up.

You're almost there, come on!


1137
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:47.742

01:36:16.095 --> 01:36:19.144
Relax, Sam. I'm seeing a lot
of lifeboats in the water.


1141
01:36:22.059 --> 01:36:24.562
You say that satellite will be
in position in three hours?


1142
01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:25.646
Yeah, that's correct.

1143
01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:27.986
So if they miss it,
they have to wait.


1144
01:36:29.025 --> 01:36:31.448

How are your driving skills?

1146
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:35.323
What does that mean? How are my driving skills?
They're horrible.


1147
01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:37.083
Not your driving.

1148
01:36:37.241 --> 01:36:40.711
Sam, how are your
driving skills?


1149
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:42.122
Good.

1150
01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:45.250
Let's see if we can't buy
the world another day.


1151
01:36:46.334 --> 01:36:47.506
Who talks like that?

1152
01:36:47.877 --> 01:36:49.550
Just get in the vehicle.
Let's go.


1153
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:51.848
I'm not getting in.
This is your show, now.


1154
01:36:51.923 --> 01:36:53.675
I don't have a death wish,
thank you very much.


1155
01:36:53.799 --> 01:36:54.925
Goodbye, everyone.

1156
01:36:55.218 --> 01:36:57.721
Stop! Stop.

1157
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:02.642
This is my property-

1158
01:38:20.052 --> 01:38:21.645
It doesn't end like this.

1159
01:38:26.225 --> 01:38:28.023
What do you want
us to do, Hopper?


1160
01:38:30.438 --> 01:38:31.906
We have no ships left.

1161
01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.526
We have one.

1162
01:38:43.034 --> 01:38:44.786
We have got a battleship.

1163
01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:49.590
Are you crazy?
That's a museum.


1164
01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:52.669
Not today.

1165
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:04.765
This ship is 70 years old.
It's totally outdated.


1166
01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:07.683
The firing systems
are all analog.


1167
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:09.648
The engines haven't been
started in a decade.


1168
01:39:09.769 --> 01:39:11.271
Which would be fine,
but they are steam,


1169
01:39:11.354 --> 01:39:13.607
which I have no idea
how to fire up.


1170
01:39:13.773 --> 01:39:15.366
And even if I had
a user's manual


1171
01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:16.943
and six weeks to
go through it all,


1172
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:19.828
we still don't have
enough crew to fire it up.


1173
01:39:20.446 --> 01:39:21.948
I don't know what
you're thinking, sir.


1174
01:39:58.317 --> 01:39:59.489
Is everyone all right?

1175
01:39:59.568 --> 01:40:02.037
Yes, sir. We're okay.

1176
01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.870
You men have given so much
to your country,


1177
01:40:09.954 --> 01:40:12.548
and no one has the right
to ask any more of you,


1178
01:40:13.624 --> 01:40:15.342
but I'm asking.

1179
01:40:16.293 --> 01:40:17.886
What do you need, son?

1180
01:40:18.796 --> 01:40:21.049
I need to borrow your boat.

1181
01:40:44.989 --> 01:40:46.161
Son.

1182
01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:51.162
Sir.

1183
01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:52.963
What the hell? Are you going
to stand there, staring at me?


1184
01:40:53.038 --> 01:40:54.961
Get your goddamn eye
on that spotter!


1185
01:40:55.124 --> 01:40:56.546
Eye on spotter, sir.

1186
01:40:59.336 --> 01:41:01.179
Been working on a
destroyer, haven't you?


1187
01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.256
Yes, sir.

1188
01:41:02.339 --> 01:41:04.057
Are you ready to play
with the big boys?


1189
01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.259
Oh, yes, sir.

1190
01:41:05.342 --> 01:41:06.685
Come on.
We need the help.


1191
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:07.808
Awesome!

Ready to rock and roll, sir.

1196
01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:27.456
How are we looking on fuel?

1197
01:41:27.531 --> 01:41:30.876
600 long tons, sir. Just
enough for a maintenance run.


1198
01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.043
Ordnance?

1199
01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:34.463
We scraped together what we could, sir.
But it's not much.


1200

All right, let's get her to sea.

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:10.461
You are going to die.
lam going to die.


1242
01:47:13.877 --> 01:47:14.878
We are all going to die.

1243
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:20.676
Just not today.

1244
01:47:40.237 --> 01:47:42.365
Let's drop some
lead on those mother...


1245
01:47:42.531 --> 01:47:43.532
Fire!

1246
01:47:58.922 --> 01:48:00.174
Reload! Reload!

1247
01:48:00.257 --> 01:48:02.305
Firing mechanism reset!
Secure the hatch.


1248
01:48:02.384 --> 01:48:03.351
Port side ready!

1249
01:48:03.427 --> 01:48:04.519
Release the anchor.

1250
01:48:19.234 --> 01:48:20.281
Incoming! Incoming!

1251
01:48:36.668 --> 01:48:37.715
You all right?

1252
01:48:37.794 --> 01:48:39.717
They ain't going to sink
this battleship, no way.


1253
01:48:39.796 --> 01:48:40.922
Hit it!

1254
01:48:52.809 --> 01:48:53.810
Everything you've got!

1255
01:49:01.193 --> 01:49:02.194
Whoo!

1256
01:49:17.876 --> 01:49:21.847
I want every available plane
on this ship in the air, now!


1257
01:49:27.010 --> 01:49:28.603
I can't believe
that worked!


1258
01:49:28.679 --> 01:49:31.307
<i>Yeah, Art of War. Fight the</i>
enemy where they aren't.


1259
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:33.313
After all these years,
that finally just clicked.


1260
01:49:33.392 --> 01:49:35.360
But that's not
what it means.


1261
01:49:35.852 --> 01:49:36.819
Really?

1262
01:49:36.895 --> 01:49:38.738
Not even close.

1263
01:50:17.394 --> 01:50:18.771
Keep going!

1264
01:50:21.064 --> 01:50:22.236
Oh, shit!

1265
01:50:33.577 --> 01:50:34.749
Mick, my leg is stuck.

1266
01:50:43.086 --> 01:50:44.133
Mick!

1267
01:50:46.465 --> 01:50:47.637
Status of weapons?

1268
01:50:47.716 --> 01:50:48.763
<i>Turret three is down.</i>

1269
01:50:48.925 --> 01:50:52.225
We got one round of high-explosive
back-aft in turret three.


1270
01:50:53.221 --> 01:50:55.940
Tell them to have it
ready when we get there.


1271
01:51:01.438 --> 01:51:02.940
I got this.

1272
01:51:14.076 --> 01:51:15.202
Beast, update.

1273
01:51:16.453 --> 01:51:18.876
I need that round. We need
to bring it to turret two.


1274
01:51:18.955 --> 01:51:21.208
Sir'?
Turret two is 500 feet away.


1275
01:51:21.291 --> 01:51:22.713
This round is over
a thousand pounds!


1276
01:51:22.793 --> 01:51:24.215
How do you expect
us to get it there?


1277
01:53:12.694 --> 01:53:15.243
Raikes! Get to the gun plot,
finger on the trigger.


1278
01:53:15.405 --> 01:53:17.203
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Come on, easy. Easy.</i>


1279
01:53:17.365 --> 01:53:19.038
Gentle, boys.
Gentle, gentle.


1280
01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:31.763
Get out of here!

1281
01:53:35.592 --> 01:53:36.593
We got to go.

1282
01:53:37.344 --> 01:53:40.439
Calm down, okay? I'm going
to frigging save you.


1283
01:53:50.357 --> 01:53:51.734
Closed, number one is armed.

1284
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.618
Coordinates?
Train, 3-3-O.


1285
01:53:53.777 --> 01:53:56.280
Elevation?

1286
01:54:06.122 --> 01:54:07.248
There! Go!

1287
01:54:08.291 --> 01:54:09.759
Let's go!

1288
01:54:12.546 --> 01:54:13.547
She's armed.

1289
01:54:13.964 --> 01:54:16.092
You better not be up there.

1290
01:54:16.591 --> 01:54:18.434
Let's go! Come on!

1291
01:54:22.222 --> 01:54:23.439
Hopper!

1292
01:54:35.652 --> 01:54:37.996
We only have one
round left, right?


1293
01:54:38.154 --> 01:54:39.201
Yeah.

1294
01:54:50.166 --> 01:54:52.510
It was an honor serving
with you, Captain.


1295
01:54:55.297 --> 01:54:56.844
The honor was mine.

1296
01:55:01.845 --> 01:55:03.597
Fire.
Fire.


1297
01:55:53.063 --> 01:55:54.064
Locked on target.

1298
01:56:23.051 --> 01:56:24.803
<i>We take great</i>
<i>pride in honoring</i>


1299
01:56:24.886 --> 01:56:28.857
<i>the many men and women who</i>
<i>demonstrated exceptional gallantry</i>


1300
01:56:29.516 --> 01:56:32.611
<i>in the face of</i>
<i>overwhelming enemy force.</i>


1301
01:56:32.769 --> 01:56:36.444
<i>Valor and courage</i>
<i>were exhibited by so many</i>


1302
01:56:36.898 --> 01:56:39.026
<i>that I cannot honor them all.</i>

1303
01:56:39.275 --> 01:56:41.573
<i>It is my great</i>
<i>privilege to recognize</i>


1304
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:45.916
<i>those few whose actions</i>
<i>deserve special note.</i>


1305
01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:50.378
<i>Lieutenant Colonel, United States</i>
<i>Army, retired, Mick Canales.</i>


1306
01:57:02.924 --> 01:57:05.803
<i>The President of the United</i>
<i>States takes great pleasure</i>


1307
01:57:05.969 --> 01:57:09.644
<i>in presenting the Navy Cross</i>
<i>to Commander Stone Hopper</i>


1308
01:57:09.973 --> 01:57:12.146
<i>for extraordinary heroism.</i>

1309
01:57:12.308 --> 01:57:15.733
<i>Receiving this award,</i>
<i>on behalf of his brother,</i>


1310
01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:17.989
<i>Lieutenant</i>
<i>Commander Alex Hopper.</i>


1311
01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:39.336
Stand fast, Mr. Hopper.

1312
01:57:42.672 --> 01:57:46.722
<i>It is my great pleasure to</i>
<i>present you with a Silver Star</i>


1313
01:57:46.885 --> 01:57:51.516
<i>for your exceptional heroism and</i>
<i>gallantry in combat operations.</i>


1314
01:58:03.735 --> 01:58:05.658
And I look forward
to seeing you at sea


1315
01:58:05.737 --> 01:58:08.411
on a ship of your
own command, soon.


1316
01:58:18.249 --> 01:58:20.126
Thank you.

1317
01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:26.808
Ordy, stop talking
for a second.


1318
01:58:26.883 --> 01:58:27.975
Come on, take
the picture, Beast.


1319
01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:30.057
Say Navy
Navy!


1320
01:58:34.808 --> 01:58:36.151
Mildly impressive, Hopper.

1321
01:58:36.226 --> 01:58:37.819
<i>You ready to get your ass</i>
off that big gray monster,


1322
01:58:37.894 --> 01:58:39.862
get out to Coronado and get your
hands dirty with the big boys?


1323
01:58:39.938 --> 01:58:41.315
Yes, sir. You think
you've got what it takes?


1324
01:58:41.397 --> 01:58:43.149
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.


1325
01:58:43.233 --> 01:58:44.906
It just might be too
much sleep, though, sir.


1326
01:58:44.901 --> 01:58:46.244
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.


1327
01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:47.320
We will have to
see about that.


1328
01:58:47.403 --> 01:58:49.872
Come on, Hopper,
cozy up to Nagata.


1329
01:58:49.948 --> 01:58:51.291
You look so cute.

1330
01:58:51.449 --> 01:58:53.076
You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?


1331
01:58:53.159 --> 01:58:54.581
You look dapper.

1332
01:58:54.744 --> 01:58:56.371
Navy. "Say,"Navy

1333
01:58:56.454 --> 01:58:58.172
Yeah, I don't know.

1334
01:58:58.248 --> 01:58:59.500
Oh!

1335
01:58:59.582 --> 01:59:00.708
Bad timing.

1336
01:59:00.875 --> 01:59:02.718
Congratulations.
Thank you.


1337
01:59:02.794 --> 01:59:04.011
How are you?
Good, how are you?


1338
01:59:04.087 --> 01:59:05.384
I love you.
I love you.


1339
01:59:05.547 --> 01:59:07.174
I'm a pretty lucky guy,
you know that?


1340
01:59:07.257 --> 01:59:10.056
Which is why I think it's a perfect
time for you to talk to my dad.


1341
01:59:10.134 --> 01:59:13.058
Where is he? I wish he
was standing right here.


1342
01:59:13.221 --> 01:59:15.349
That's perfect,
because look!


1343
01:59:15.932 --> 01:59:18.811
Your wish came true,
honey. Go get him.


1344
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:23.231
Thumbs up, that helps.

1345
01:59:25.108 --> 01:59:26.109
Sir.

1346
01:59:27.277 --> 01:59:28.494
What is it?

1347
01:59:29.612 --> 01:59:32.786
I want you to know
that I am in love with Sam.


1348
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:39.960
And I am asking your permission
to marry your daughter.


1349
01:59:43.626 --> 01:59:44.673
No.

1350
01:59:44.752 --> 01:59:46.754
Thank you, sir.
I mean, it's...


1351
01:59:47.922 --> 01:59:49.799
What?
No.


1352
01:59:51.634 --> 01:59:52.977
Sir...

1353
01:59:54.345 --> 01:59:56.689
I saved the world.

1354
01:59:57.348 --> 02:00:01.023
Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.


1355
02:00:02.145 --> 02:00:05.649
But...
No means no, Hopper.


1356
02:00:05.815 --> 02:00:07.988
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.


1357
02:00:08.818 --> 02:00:11.822
I think I will have
a chicken burrito.


1358
02:00:13.448 --> 02:00:14.665
Chicken...

1359
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:16.997
Sir.

1360
02:00:20.038 --> 02:00:21.415
Come along, Hopper.

1361
02:00:21.497 --> 02:00:24.125
We will discuss the terms
of your surrender over a meal.


1362
02:00:26.336 --> 02:00:27.508
Yes, sir.

1363
02:00:29.797 --> 02:00:31.174
She told you about that?

1364
02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:42.020
You got nothing on Jay
-Z.

1365
02:09:42.933 --> 02:09:44.401
I mean, even I
couldn't get Beyoncé.


1366
02:09:44.477 --> 02:09:45.854
I couldn't get
Beyoncé either.


1367
02:09:45.936 --> 02:09:47.062
No way.

1368
02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:48.814
Whoa.

1369
02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:51.066
What the...

1370
02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.868
What is that?

1371
02:10:00.201 --> 02:10:01.498
Don't get too close to it.

1372
02:10:01.577 --> 02:10:04.956
Whoa, guys! Look at this!

1373
02:10:05.122 --> 02:10:07.341
- Don't go too close!
- Don't run to it.


1374
02:10:07.416 --> 02:10:09.009
Do you think that looks like a door?
- A door?


1375
02:10:09.084 --> 02:10:10.836
Hello?
Anyone home?


1376
02:10:11.795 --> 02:10:13.138
That's not
going to help, is it?


1377
02:10:14.632 --> 02:10:16.600
This really helps.

1378
02:10:23.265 --> 02:10:25.108
Do you know
what that is?


1379
02:10:25.267 --> 02:10:27.110
We think there's
something inside of it.


1380
02:10:27.269 --> 02:10:28.441
Are going
to open it, Jimmy?


1381
02:10:28.521 --> 02:10:31.866
If Jimmy says he's getting
in, he's getting in!


1382
02:10:41.992 --> 02:10:43.665
Come on, Jimmy!
Whoo!


1383
02:10:43.827 --> 02:10:45.170
Jimmy!

1384
02:10:45.329 --> 02:10:48.299
That's it. Come to daddy.

1385
02:10:51.961 --> 02:10:53.554
Jimmy! Oh, my God!

1386
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:54.676
Yes!
