1
00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:02.801
I got you, Sensei. Stay with me.

2
00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:05.510
You're a life saver, Casey Jones.

3
00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.218
I learned from the best.
Come on, we're almost there.


4
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.093
Bad doggies!

5
00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:27.135
Impeccable timing, little brother.
Very dramatic.


6
00:01:40.468 --> 00:01:43.551
Help him, Michelangelo. 
He's hurt bad.

7
00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:58.676
That's it. The resistance failed.
The Krang won.


8
00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:00.843
But... but it isn't over.

9
00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:03.426
We've still got a ninja's greatest weapon...

10
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.510
hope.

11
00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:07.551
That and a badass mystic warrior.

12
00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:10.843
Mikey, we need a time gateway.

13
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.843
It'll take everything I have.

14
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:16.635
I know, but this is our last chance.

15
00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.135
It's our only chance.

16
00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:21.510
Hm.

17
00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:26.218
- Wait, what's going on? Where is he going?
- Casey, listen.


18
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.426
The Krang first came to our planet
through a mystic doorway.


19
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.885
The key that opened the doorway
looked like this.


20
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.343
Why are you telling me this?

21
00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.551
Because Mikey's
about to send you back in time


22
00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.760
to the day that the key was stolen.

23
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.385
Wait, he's gonna what?

24
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.385
The people who stole that key
opened the doorway for the Krang.


25
00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:13.343
You have to find it before that happens.

26
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.635
Find the key, stop the Krang.

27
00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:17.843
- But, Sensei...
- Say it!


28
00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:21.343
"Find the key, stop the Krang."

29
00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:25.718
I don't want to lose you.

30
00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:28.635
Casey, it's not about me.

31
00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:33.885
They found us!

32
00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:38.551
Mikey!

33
00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:53.260
Master Michelangelo, no! 
You're gonna...

34
00:04:16.843 --> 00:04:17.843
Casey...

35
00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:22.176
when you're done saving the world,
do me a favor.


36
00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:25.385
Grab a slice!

37
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.551
Huh?

38
00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:46.551
Where...

39
00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:47.676
I made it?

40
00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:54.468
All right, Casey, here we go.
Find the key, stop the Krang.


41
00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:04.885
<i>♪ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ♪</i>

42
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.593
Easy does it, Leo.

43
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.093
You've got this.

44
00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:14.301
Concentrate.

45
00:05:15.593 --> 00:05:18.010
The whole world is counting on you...

46
00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:22.343
to break the pizza box stack record!

47
00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:25.426
One-hundred, twenty-five boxes!

48
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.385
They say it couldn't be done,
but look who's doing it, <i>moi.</i>


49
00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:31.010
That's Spanish for Leo.

50
00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:35.801
Go ahead, my non-lingual friend,
count your unhatched fowl.


51
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.468
My record stands until you reach the top,

52
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:41.468
which, according to
my calculations of wind speed,


53
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:45.093
barometric pressure, and dew point,
is highly unlikely. What?


54
00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:48.218
According to my calculations,

55
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:51.885
as long as you believe in yourself,
you can do anything!


56
00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:56.551
Thanks, little brother.
No one believes in himself more than me.


57
00:05:56.635 --> 00:05:58.051
Leo!

58
00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:03.135
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!

59
00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:07.760
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!

60
00:06:10.468 --> 00:06:13.218
- Yeah! I am Leo!
- Yeah, baby!


61
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.260
There you are.

62
00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.968
I've been looking all over for you guys.

63
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.051
Raph, guess who just broke the record?

64
00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:22.968
What? You did? 
How many did you...

65
00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:26.343
Stop distracting Raph!
We were supposed to be training...


66
00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:28.385
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. 
Hold that thought.

67
00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:30.385
Donnie?

68
00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:31.843
Donnie?

69
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.385
You, sir, have bested me. <i>Mazel.</i>

70
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:38.676
- Ahem?
- Ahem?


71
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:42.926
Leo. Leo.

72
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.885
Leo! Leo!

73
00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:46.135
Stop it!

74
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:50.135
Leo, we have work to do,
and you dragged him out here for this?


75
00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:54.510
Training, record-breaking.
The choice was clear.


76
00:06:54.593 --> 00:06:58.551
Dang it, Leo.
Everything's not about you.


77
00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:01.260
When are you gonna grow up
and start acting like a hero?


78
00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:04.510
And there it is. Gentlemen...

79
00:07:04.593 --> 00:07:08.510
- What was that? What are you guys doing?
- A little game I invented.


80
00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:11.801
Every time you say "heroes,"
we take a bite of pizza.


81
00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:14.635
I don't say "heroes" that often!

82
00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:16.051
Leo!

83
00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.093
So what if I say
he... that word a lot.

84
00:07:19.176 --> 00:07:21.968
It's a good word. 
We need to be that word.

85
00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:25.635
Relax, Raph.
We've got this hero thing wired.


86
00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.926
I mean, our ninjocity is off the charts.

87
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.801
We've got some kickin' mystic weapons.

88
00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:35.051
And do I need to remind you who has
four shells and defeated the Shredder?


89
00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:37.801
- Hey.
- Leo!


90
00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:41.051
You just don't get it.

91
00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:43.093
Huh? What is all that... That's me.

92
00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:47.051
Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!

93
00:07:47.135 --> 00:07:49.760
Uh-huh?

94
00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:50.676
Oh, come on!

95
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.176
Has nobody read <i>Donnie's Big Book
of Bad Guy Codes?</i> Nobody?


96
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.801
- Nope.
- Never gonna happen.


97
00:07:59.176 --> 00:08:02.301
We did it!
We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!


98
00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:03.468
Of course we did.

99
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:06.635
Nothing can stop Supervillain Warren Stone

100
00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:09.385
and his conjuring compatriot,
Hypno-Potamus!


101
00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:15.301
There they are! 
Okay, here's the plan...

102
00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:19.885
Raph, relax. Who needs a plan
when we got crazy cool mystic powers?


103
00:08:19.968 --> 00:08:20.968
Leo!

104
00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:25.010
Come on, swords, it's portal time!

105
00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:28.218
I'll see you guys later
after I save the day! Buh-buh-bye!


106
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:30.593
Stop! We need to work together!

107
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.551
Wellington Sunday!
It's those pesky Turtles.


108
00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:42.676
License and registration.

109
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.301
Oh, I'm sorry, mate.
I must have left it in my other jacket.


110
00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:51.926
Leo! Ah!

111
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.801
Leo, we're coming.

112
00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:58.426
- Don't worry.
- I got 'em right where I want 'em.


113
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.926
Doesn't look that way to me.
Donnie, Mikey, Maneuver 12.


114
00:09:03.551 --> 00:09:04.885
- On it!
- Ha!


115
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.260
Whip-o-rama!

116
00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:20.593
Prepare to be Donnie'd by my mystic tech!

117
00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:35.885
Oh boy.

118
00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:42.260
Okay, creeps, hand over the stolen thingy!

119
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:43.801
Oh no.

120
00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:48.135
That's gotta be what they stole!

121
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.010
I got it!

122
00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:53.676
With those clumsy hands?
No, I got this one.


123
00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:09.551
Oh, you portal-chopped him!

124
00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:13.343
"Portal-chopped," I like it.
Maybe my new catchphrase?


125
00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:16.801
Okay, let's see how it fits.
"You've been portal chopped!"


126
00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:26.176
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
I'll be taking this.


127
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.218
The Foot Clan?

128
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:35.885
Finally, after all these centuries,
this is ours.


129
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.510
Yes, well, of course, thanks to us,
delivered safe and sound.


130
00:10:39.593 --> 00:10:41.260
No problemo, partner.

131
00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:45.260
Hey, just quietly, are we partners?
We are partners, yeah?


132
00:10:49.593 --> 00:10:54.051
Oh man, that thing must be dangerous
if the Foot Clan wants it.


133
00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:55.176
Ya think?

134
00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:59.135
Huh? What?

135
00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:05.843
I clearly said, "I got it."
Everybody heard me say, "I got it."


136
00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:08.968
Yeah, but I got it with style.

137
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.010
But you didn't get it!

138
00:11:11.093 --> 00:11:16.010
You lost it, and now
we've got a Foot Clan situation, Leo.


139
00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:22.468
Huh?

140
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:25.051
What's it gonna take
for you to be serious, Leo?


141
00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:28.093
And end up with a worry line
between my eyes like you?


142
00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:30.676
No, no, no, I do
not want a Raph chasm.

143
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.885
"Chasm"?

144
00:11:31.968 --> 00:11:35.093
You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.

145
00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:40.760
The only reason I have a chasm
is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.


146
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:44.010
You just don't get it, Leo.

147
00:11:44.093 --> 00:11:45.676
I'm the oldest here.

148
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.926
I'm responsible for keeping us safe

149
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.968
and making sure we can
handle anything that comes our way.


150
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:56.093
'Cause if I don't,
you could all end up dead.


151
00:11:56.635 --> 00:11:58.468
Sorry, I missed that.

152
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:02.218
Can you repeat everything from...
well, everything?


153
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.635
No wonder you always want to train.
You really need the practice.


154
00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:12.510
Let him go, Mikey.

155
00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:13.968
Wait! No!

156
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:17.051
Boys! Stop this arguing!

157
00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:18.801
But, Dad, Leo keeps...

158
00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:20.176
Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh.

159
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.426
No more.

160
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.718
You are a team. 
You are brothers.

161
00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:28.885
And most importantly, you are too loud!

162
00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:30.760
I cannot hear my TV show!

163
00:12:30.843 --> 00:12:34.468
Tristan finally proposed to Annabelle,
but did she say yes?


164
00:12:34.551 --> 00:12:37.051
I don't know because of you!

165
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.968
Be the ninjas I taught you to be,

166
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.843
respectful and quiet!

167
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.968
Sorry. Excuse me.

168
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:52.385
Hey, how am I
supposed to find this thing?

169
00:13:02.426 --> 00:13:03.426
Whoa.

170
00:13:05.093 --> 00:13:06.343
So many people.

171
00:13:09.968 --> 00:13:12.176
How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?

172
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:15.968
I really wish you were here.

173
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.343
Wait, you are!

174
00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:20.801
I just need to find you.

175
00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:25.135
April.

176
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:28.301
She'll know.

177
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.801
Huh?

178
00:13:34.885 --> 00:13:37.135
Hi, professor. 
Do you have a sec?

179
00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:38.135
Hmm.

180
00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:40.426
Are you even in this class?

181
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.635
I'm April O'Neil, journalism major.

182
00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:45.760
I write for the
<i>Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>


183
00:13:45.843 --> 00:13:49.135
Maybe I could get some shots of you
at the whiteboard for a story?


184
00:13:49.218 --> 00:13:51.093
Oh! Of course.

185
00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:54.468
So, uh, what... what should I do?

186
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:57.260
You know, just write something sciencey.

187
00:13:57.343 --> 00:14:00.301
I actually have the perfect equation
for your article.


188
00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:03.343
Now a few where you're
staring thoughtfully at your work.


189
00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:07.301
Oh, I always stare intently
at my equations.


190
00:14:07.385 --> 00:14:09.135
Especially this one.

191
00:14:09.968 --> 00:14:13.301
You know,
I think I should put on my lab coat.


192
00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.343
- Look at it!
- Oh! Okay.


193
00:14:17.926 --> 00:14:21.635
You know, I could probably
stare at this equation all day.


194
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.176
This is April O'Neil, investigative
reporter, <i>Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>


195
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
For years, this college shot down
rumors that a foreign government


196
00:14:30.343 --> 00:14:31.510
is paying them millions

197
00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:34.176
to develop a super-toxic
herbicidal deforestation bomb.


198
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.635
Those rumors end today because
I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.


199
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.926
April O'Neil.

200
00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:51.926
Ooh. This stuff looks nasty.

201
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.760
Hey! Who's there?

202
00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:54.843
Hm?

203
00:15:00.468 --> 00:15:01.926
Evidence, baby.

204
00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:06.426
Oh boy.

205
00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:15.093
Well, it's a good thing video
ain't the only thing I took.


206
00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:22.385
April! Yes!

207
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.718
- Commander O'Neil...
- Catlike reflex!


208
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:32.676
What's the matter with you,
creeping up on a person in the dark?


209
00:15:37.468 --> 00:15:38.468
What the...

210
00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.635
And then I saw that picture
and I brought him here.


211
00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:49.676
Sensei?

212
00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:52.468
Hm?

213
00:15:53.093 --> 00:15:53.926
It's you!

214
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.218
It's all of you! Together!

215
00:15:56.301 --> 00:16:00.843
- I never thought I'd see you again!
- I'm so happy I could hug you!


216
00:16:06.635 --> 00:16:09.676
Who are you,
and why do you have a picture of us?


217
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.176
Yeah, who took this? '
Cause I look great.

218
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.551
What's your favorite pizza?
'Cause I'm ordering right now.


219
00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:19.093
And why are you
wearing genius-built apparel?


220
00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:21.801
That's trademarked!

221
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.051
Grappling hook!

222
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.551
What's going on?

223
00:16:30.843 --> 00:16:33.218
He's trying to escape!

224
00:16:33.301 --> 00:16:35.718
- Want me to knock him out again?
- Let me.


225
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:37.010
Donnie? Donnie!

226
00:16:37.635 --> 00:16:39.135
Oh, okay.

227
00:16:39.718 --> 00:16:42.343
Wa... Wait, stop!
I'm a friend. Let me explain.


228
00:16:44.718 --> 00:16:45.801
Let's start over.

229
00:16:46.635 --> 00:16:50.218
My name is Casey Jones,
and the reason I have this photo


230
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.635
and your tech
is because you gave it to me,


231
00:16:53.718 --> 00:16:56.926
but not yet, because I'm from...

232
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.968
the future!

233
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.593
This isn't a joke.

234
00:17:04.676 --> 00:17:08.426
Please, if time travel is possible,
future Donnie would have come back


235
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.051
and already given me
all the lottery numbers like we planned.


236
00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:16.260
It's true. I need you to believe me.
Humanity depends on it.


237
00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:19.968
In the future,
an alien race decimated the planet.


238
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:24.426
We were hunted. We lived in caves.
We ate leaves and rats.


239
00:17:24.968 --> 00:17:25.801
No offense.

240
00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:28.426
None taken. We are delicious.

241
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:33.676
I know how this sounds,
but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.


242
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.135
I do like how he calls me "Master."

243
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.468
Of course I do.

244
00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:42.801
You are the greatest ninja
the world has ever seen.


245
00:17:42.885 --> 00:17:45.926
You told me to find the key
and stop the Krang.


246
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.843
"Aliens." Pfft.

247
00:17:47.926 --> 00:17:51.010
Sure.
This story just keeps getting better.


248
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.010
Splints?

249
00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:55.426
"The Krang"?

250
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.343
I have heard that name.

251
00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:02.260
Powerful, barbaric creatures
worshiped by the Foot Clan.


252
00:18:02.343 --> 00:18:05.218
Legend says they came from the stars.

253
00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:08.635
<i>Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,</i>

254
00:18:08.718 --> 00:18:12.510
<i>to enslave our world
like so many before us.</i>


255
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.301
<i>All seemed lost,</i>

256
00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:18.801
<i>until great mystic warriors
forged a mighty weapon,</i>


257
00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:24.260
<i>a key that was used to lock them
in a prison dimension beyond this realm.</i>


258
00:18:24.343 --> 00:18:27.260
<i>Over the centuries,
the mystic key remained hidden</i>


259
00:18:27.343 --> 00:18:32.051
to protect humankind
and prevent the return of the Krang.


260
00:18:32.635 --> 00:18:33.635
So...

261
00:18:33.718 --> 00:18:36.593
Future boy is really from the future?

262
00:18:37.093 --> 00:18:39.093
Mind...

263
00:18:39.593 --> 00:18:42.343
Someone finds the key! Today!

264
00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:46.135
They steal it and use it
to open a doorway and free the Krang!


265
00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:48.801
That's why I came
back, to find it first.

266
00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:51.718
Master Leonardo drew a picture
on the back of that photo.


267
00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:53.385
So to stop the Krang,

268
00:18:53.468 --> 00:18:56.551
all we have to do
is find the key before it's stolen.


269
00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:58.551
- Mm.
- Hm-mm.


270
00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:00.010
Huh.

271
00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:03.718
What?

272
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:08.760
Yeah, did future handsome,
amazing me tell you what to do


273
00:19:08.843 --> 00:19:10.676
in case that already happened?

274
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.968
'Cause that already happened.

275
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.135
Mm!

276
00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:17.843
Oh no, we're too late!

277
00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:24.218
No, we're not.

278
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:26.968
'Cause we know who has the key,
the Foot Clan.


279
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:29.218
Okay, we gotta find them
before they use it,


280
00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.718
and this time, we do it together!

281
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.510
Uh, can someone untie me now?

282
00:19:41.593 --> 00:19:43.801
Oh no...

283
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:58.218
Villain to villain,
your hideout is a bit... lacking.


284
00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:01.343
Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace,

285
00:20:01.426 --> 00:20:04.051
maybe a fuzzy white cat
with a diamond necklace?


286
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:15.551
Tonight, we liberate our masters
from their dimensional prison.


287
00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:16.968
With this key,

288
00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:21.926
we shall free them to lay waste
to this world and enslave its people.


289
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.385
Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob
a bank and be, you know, crime buddies.


290
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.593
We shall follow the Krang
as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!


291
00:20:32.676 --> 00:20:34.676
Bored.

292
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:36.635
You!

293
00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:38.260
- Leo!
- What?


294
00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:43.010
I was waiting for a good spot to jump in,
but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.


295
00:20:43.093 --> 00:20:45.385
There it is! That's the key.

296
00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:51.176
Get them! Don't let them
interfere with the ceremony!


297
00:20:58.093 --> 00:20:59.093
No!

298
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.176
It started!

299
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.135
He's unlocking the doorway!
We need to get up there right now!


300
00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:08.176
Casey, go. We've got you covered.

301
00:21:38.843 --> 00:21:40.843
Oh no.

302
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:48.260
Oh.

303
00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:51.343
Oh no! They're here!

304
00:21:51.426 --> 00:21:54.385
Then let's make sure
their visit's short and sweet.


305
00:22:00.093 --> 00:22:03.135
I'm finally free!

306
00:22:04.051 --> 00:22:10.010
The people of this planet
will pay for what they've done to me.


307
00:22:10.093 --> 00:22:13.551
Welcome to Earth.
I hope you don't enjoy your stay!


308
00:22:31.635 --> 00:22:33.301
Oh!

309
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:40.051
Enough tricks!

310
00:22:50.176 --> 00:22:52.801
Mikey! Donnie! No!

311
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.343
No...

312
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:18.051
Raph, what happened to our powers?

313
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.010
They... They're gone.

314
00:23:20.593 --> 00:23:22.426
What did they do to us?

315
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.885
Brother, sister, join me.

316
00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:32.343
Time for us to finish remaking
this universe in the image of Krang.


317
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.926
How I've waited for this day.

318
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.468
Indeed.

319
00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:47.010
Brother, widen the portal
and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.


320
00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:51.760
Once it is here,
this world will kneel before us.


321
00:23:52.843 --> 00:23:57.010
Oh, if you two don't mind,
I haven't killed anything in ages.


322
00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:14.051
No!

323
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:29.885
Huh?

324
00:24:30.426 --> 00:24:31.426
No!

325
00:24:43.718 --> 00:24:44.801
Retreat!

326
00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:46.510
Retreat? We don't retreat!

327
00:24:46.593 --> 00:24:50.885
Leo, for once, listen to me.
They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.


328
00:24:50.968 --> 00:24:52.551
You don't understand.

329
00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:55.385
If we don't close that doorway,
it's only gonna get worse.


330
00:24:55.468 --> 00:24:56.468
Raph?

331
00:24:56.551 --> 00:25:00.051
I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo!
Donnie, escape pods, now!


332
00:25:01.468 --> 00:25:03.468
You don't have to tell me twice!

333
00:25:25.801 --> 00:25:27.801
Sensei, we need to get that key!

334
00:25:41.343 --> 00:25:42.426
Leo!

335
00:26:11.468 --> 00:26:12.635
Huh?

336
00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:32.176
Raph?

337
00:26:40.968 --> 00:26:41.885
Raph, wait, no.

338
00:26:41.968 --> 00:26:45.593
Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
Raph! No, Raph!


339
00:26:51.635 --> 00:26:53.760
<i>Escape pods incoming.</i>

340
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.926
<i>Congratulations
on surviving, fam.</i>


341
00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:03.926
Huh?

342
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.551
Oh, I hate that.

343
00:27:05.635 --> 00:27:07.968
Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?

344
00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:09.593
How did we get here?

345
00:27:09.676 --> 00:27:12.760
Donnie pods.
We've never had to use those before.


346
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.218
So, how would everyone
rate their escape experience?


347
00:27:17.301 --> 00:27:20.260
"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied,"
"Extremely satisfied"?


348
00:27:20.343 --> 00:27:22.843
- Donnie!
- Sorry. Sorry.


349
00:27:22.926 --> 00:27:24.551
Data collection calms me down.

350
00:27:27.051 --> 00:27:28.093
Splints.

351
00:27:28.176 --> 00:27:30.676
This is terrible! 
Why did we leave?

352
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.135
In case you didn't notice,
we were getting our butts kicked!


353
00:27:34.218 --> 00:27:36.718
But my mission was to stop them!

354
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:38.551
Now, the Krang are using that key

355
00:27:38.635 --> 00:27:41.718
to bring in something
that will destroy the world.


356
00:27:42.218 --> 00:27:43.051
We lost.

357
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.885
Oof.

358
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760
- Where's my other pod?
- Where's Raph?


359
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.676
Ah, did you know this would happen?
Why didn't you tell me?


360
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.510
- What are you talking about?
- Easy!


361
00:28:05.593 --> 00:28:09.385
- Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph?
- Leo, what happened to Raph?


362
00:28:09.468 --> 00:28:10.593
Leonardo?

363
00:28:12.343 --> 00:28:13.176
They...

364
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.593
They got him.

365
00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:15.926
You left Raph?

366
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.176
He left himself.

367
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.510
He used his pod to save me, all because
I went after this stupid thing.


368
00:28:21.593 --> 00:28:23.260
You got it! Nice.

369
00:28:23.343 --> 00:28:25.968
"Nice"? They captured Raph!

370
00:28:27.051 --> 00:28:29.301
He's from the future!
He knew this would happen!


371
00:28:29.385 --> 00:28:32.010
No, I didn't.
This didn't happen in my time.


372
00:28:32.635 --> 00:28:36.010
We changed the past,
and you got the key.

373
00:28:36.093 --> 00:28:38.176
That means there's
still a chance to stop them.


374
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.426
- No, we have to save Raph. Come on.
- Leo, wait.


375
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.510
If you won't come, 
I'll go myself.

376
00:28:44.676 --> 00:28:48.426
- We've lost our mystic powers.
- We don't have a plan!


377
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.843
We don't need a plan.

378
00:28:49.926 --> 00:28:52.926
"I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen," his words.


379
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.301
Shouldn't we talk about this

380
00:28:54.385 --> 00:28:57.135
before we run off all half-cocked,
willy-nilly, pell-mell?


381
00:28:57.218 --> 00:29:00.260
I keep being told
I'm doing this hero thing wrong.


382
00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:02.176
But I got the key, didn't I?

383
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.551
I get results,
so now we're doing it my way.


384
00:29:05.635 --> 00:29:08.968
My son, listen to your team.

385
00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:10.635
This is not about you.

386
00:29:11.135 --> 00:29:13.468
They made it about me
when they took my brother.


387
00:29:15.926 --> 00:29:17.635
Trust me, I got this.

388
00:29:19.343 --> 00:29:20.718
Donnie, you're driving.

389
00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:27.301
What do we do with this?

390
00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:31.301
We can't just bring it with us,
but we can't just leave it behind.


391
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.635
Then we should destroy it.

392
00:29:33.718 --> 00:29:36.176
Splints and I will stay here
and take care of business.


393
00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:39.968
Mm-hmm.

394
00:29:43.718 --> 00:29:45.301
Thanks, Commander O'Neil.

395
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.135
"Commander"? I like the sound of that.

396
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.718
Oh, look at it.

397
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:09.010
Disgusting.

398
00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:11.301
Try looking in a mirror.

399
00:30:11.385 --> 00:30:13.218
Ugh, it's talking at me.

400
00:30:14.176 --> 00:30:16.093
I'm going to rip out its tongue.

401
00:30:16.718 --> 00:30:18.051
Forgive my sister.

402
00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.801
She's got a bit of a temper.

403
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.718
And being in prison for a thousand years
hasn't done her any favors.


404
00:30:28.885 --> 00:30:30.885
You're not human.

405
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.135
What are you?

406
00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:34.551
Let me go, and I'll show you.

407
00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:36.510
Hmm.

408
00:30:37.093 --> 00:30:40.176
You're more powerful
than the people of this planet,


409
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.301
yet you defend them.

410
00:30:42.926 --> 00:30:45.551
- Why?
- It's my duty.


411
00:30:47.593 --> 00:30:50.510
A word used by the weak.

412
00:30:50.593 --> 00:30:54.051
Many planets before yours
have spoken of duty.


413
00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:57.426
They too have been consumed by the Krang.

414
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:02.260
And now our glorious crusade continues

415
00:31:02.343 --> 00:31:06.051
to restore the natural order of things.

416
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:11.260
The strong will devour the weak.

417
00:31:11.343 --> 00:31:12.343
Last I checked,

418
00:31:12.426 --> 00:31:15.760
we weren't the ones locked in a
prison dimension for a thousand years.


419
00:31:15.843 --> 00:31:17.468
That's called "trash talk."

420
00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:19.135
A rare misstep.

421
00:31:19.218 --> 00:31:22.176
Once I retrieve the key
from your comrades,


422
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.926
I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,

423
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.885
and you will witness
the true power of the Krang.


424
00:31:28.968 --> 00:31:34.551
Now, where have they taken my key?

425
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.468
It won't tell you anything.

426
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:39.510
Let me kill it.

427
00:31:39.593 --> 00:31:43.051
Lady brain face here is right.
I'm not telling you jack.


428
00:31:45.343 --> 00:31:47.135
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:31:47.676 --> 00:31:49.510
I'll look myself.

430
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.010
There it is.

431
00:32:03.718 --> 00:32:05.551
They always do it the hard way.

432
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.593
Our brother and I will secure
a location for the dimensional doorway.


433
00:32:13.676 --> 00:32:16.843
Take these soldiers
and retrieve me my key.


434
00:32:16.926 --> 00:32:18.551
We live to serve.

435
00:32:19.051 --> 00:32:23.260
You will serve me
whether you live or not.

436
00:32:54.426 --> 00:32:56.093
What is this thing?

437
00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:59.093
Hold on
to your gluteus maximi!


438
00:33:00.135 --> 00:33:03.760
The Turtle Tank, baby!
It's how we roll in the past.


439
00:33:03.843 --> 00:33:06.218
I mean, the present. I mean...

440
00:33:06.301 --> 00:33:09.801
- Ugh! Time travel's confusing.
- They're on the move.


441
00:33:09.885 --> 00:33:12.593
According to the subcutaneous tracker
I put on Raph...


442
00:33:12.676 --> 00:33:15.301
Wait, does that mean
you put trackers on all of us?


443
00:33:16.426 --> 00:33:17.843
"No"?

444
00:33:18.343 --> 00:33:23.010
No, of course I did... n't.

445
00:33:23.093 --> 00:33:25.010
Based on their trajectory, they're headed...

446
00:33:25.093 --> 00:33:27.218
...to the tallest building in the city.

447
00:33:27.301 --> 00:33:29.593
That's right, Metro Tower.

448
00:33:29.676 --> 00:33:32.968
I heard the story so many times as a kid,
but I never thought...


449
00:33:33.468 --> 00:33:34.510
"And behold,

450
00:33:34.593 --> 00:33:38.968
from their perch atop New York City,
the Krang ripped open the sky itself."


451
00:33:39.676 --> 00:33:41.218
"What came out was terror,

452
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:44.760
and what rained down upon us
was worse than death."


453
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.468
They told that to kids?

454
00:33:49.968 --> 00:33:51.635
Man, the future is harsh.

455
00:33:52.343 --> 00:33:54.135
I'm not gonna let that happen.

456
00:33:54.218 --> 00:33:56.718
We need to get into Metro Tower
without being spotted.


457
00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.218
We'll take the subway tunnels.

458
00:33:58.301 --> 00:34:01.801
Subway tunnels don't offer much
in the way of an escape if we need it.


459
00:34:01.885 --> 00:34:04.885
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, maybe we should...


460
00:34:04.968 --> 00:34:07.551
Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?

461
00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:16.676
Hm?

462
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.301
Prepare the site so we may
bring forth the Technodrome.


463
00:34:31.385 --> 00:34:33.010
Yes, brother.

464
00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:53.760
See? Smooth sailing.
We'll have Raph in no time.


465
00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:55.093
I hope he's okay.

466
00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:58.135
How are we gonna find him
once we get there?


467
00:34:58.218 --> 00:35:01.093
I have a lot of questions
regarding "once we get there."


468
00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:05.760
Relax. We'll do what we always do.
Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.


469
00:35:05.843 --> 00:35:09.176
That's exactly how you freed all those
families from the Krang labor camp.


470
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.676
Yeah, that sounds like me.

471
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.801
In the future,
you guys are beyond amazing.


472
00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:17.301
The mystic powers you're able
to harness are on a whole other level.


473
00:35:17.385 --> 00:35:19.301
Of course! What about my future?

474
00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:21.593
I'm expecting big things for me.

475
00:35:21.676 --> 00:35:24.760
How many Nobel prizes do I have?
Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.


476
00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:29.843
Donnie, you were the most brilliant,
innovative mind of all time.


477
00:35:29.926 --> 00:35:33.510
I'm shocked, I am.
Go on, continue to meet my expectations.


478
00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:35.010
What do I do in the future?

479
00:35:35.093 --> 00:35:39.343
You are the most powerful mystic warrior
the world has ever known.


480
00:35:39.926 --> 00:35:43.010
With those two hands,
you sent me back in time.


481
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.676
Wow!

482
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.968
Actually,
there is something I should tell you.


483
00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.468
<i>Auto brake engaged.</i>

484
00:36:04.551 --> 00:36:05.551
Huh.

485
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:06.843
Wow.

486
00:36:06.926 --> 00:36:08.760
Think we're in the right place?

487
00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.260
Looks like the Metro Tower station
is on the other side of those vines.


488
00:36:13.343 --> 00:36:14.801
Great. Let's hoof it.

489
00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:18.426
Through the disgusting,
drippy slime jungle?


490
00:36:21.718 --> 00:36:24.135
I know. I know. 
Leo knows best,

491
00:36:24.218 --> 00:36:26.176
but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.

492
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.176
Feeling a lack of rush
in this rush hour, right?


493
00:36:38.843 --> 00:36:42.385
I don't know, Leo.
Something feels...


494
00:36:43.885 --> 00:36:44.885
off.

495
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:49.843
Don't worry. I won't let us die.
I'm a mystic warrior.


496
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.926
"I feel better already,"
he said without a hint of sarcasm.


497
00:36:55.218 --> 00:36:56.760
Look, the stairs.

498
00:36:56.843 --> 00:37:01.801
Sneaking in from below was the right move.
Those slimeballs will never see us coming.


499
00:37:09.385 --> 00:37:13.135
We tried to jackhammer it,
flamethrower it, pour acid on it...


500
00:37:14.051 --> 00:37:17.510
I thought lasers cut everything!
How did that not work?


501
00:37:18.343 --> 00:37:19.926
There's not even a scratch!

502
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.135
Maybe it was your aim.

503
00:37:23.218 --> 00:37:25.885
Maybe your big rat
head got in the way!

504
00:37:28.468 --> 00:37:30.468
Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.

505
00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:32.593
Okay, deep breaths.

506
00:37:32.676 --> 00:37:34.760
You said some things, 
I said some things.

507
00:37:34.843 --> 00:37:37.260
Maybe we should just
get back to saving the world.


508
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:39.551
What's next?

509
00:37:39.635 --> 00:37:41.551
Huh?

510
00:37:42.968 --> 00:37:44.885
This cannot be good.

511
00:37:48.843 --> 00:37:51.510
April O'Neil!

512
00:37:55.551 --> 00:37:57.051
Come back here!

513
00:37:57.135 --> 00:37:58.885
Faster.

514
00:38:00.218 --> 00:38:01.593
Faster!

515
00:38:02.093 --> 00:38:04.010
I knew this was a bad idea.

516
00:38:04.093 --> 00:38:06.760
Leo, there's too many. 
We should go back.

517
00:38:06.843 --> 00:38:09.135
No, we're gonna get to those stairs.

518
00:38:09.218 --> 00:38:12.176
Leo, we're not gonna make it!
We have to turn back.


519
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.301
We push forward, get Raph, that's final.

520
00:38:25.135 --> 00:38:28.218
Mystic hands!

521
00:38:36.176 --> 00:38:37.718
Donnie! Mikey!

522
00:38:38.926 --> 00:38:42.885
Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell!
You're exposed!


523
00:38:44.426 --> 00:38:45.885
We gotta find shelter!

524
00:38:49.385 --> 00:38:51.426
Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!

525
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.968
Oh. Keep it down, daddy!

526
00:39:00.676 --> 00:39:04.135
Run, insects, but you can't escape!

527
00:39:08.176 --> 00:39:09.176
Don't!

528
00:39:10.343 --> 00:39:13.260
The key, human! 
Give it to me!

529
00:39:13.343 --> 00:39:14.510
Ah!

530
00:39:31.593 --> 00:39:36.343
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my face?


531
00:39:36.426 --> 00:39:37.968
Ha!

532
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:40.718
I knew that stuff
was nasty! I told y'all!

533
00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:43.176
Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.

534
00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:12.426
Ah!

535
00:40:16.926 --> 00:40:18.176
Donnie, come in.

536
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.301
They found us. 
Where should we go? Donnie?

537
00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.760
<i>We're trapped.</i>

538
00:40:22.843 --> 00:40:25.260
We are trapped
in the subway under Metro Tower.


539
00:40:25.343 --> 00:40:27.093
The tank is running on emergency power

540
00:40:27.176 --> 00:40:30.260
and is covered
in some kind of Krang bio-growth.


541
00:40:30.343 --> 00:40:32.426
- I repeat...
- April, come quick!


542
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.468
<i>We're getting squished!</i>

543
00:40:34.551 --> 00:40:35.968
We're on our way!

544
00:40:36.051 --> 00:40:38.676
But, April, how will we get them out?

545
00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:40.718
I've got an idea.

546
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.510
Yeesh.
Remind me to never get on your bad side.


547
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:55.510
Casey!

548
00:40:56.385 --> 00:40:57.468
Casey, you okay?

549
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.635
Donnie, Mikey, anybody?

550
00:41:04.718 --> 00:41:06.885
Ah!

551
00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:12.426
What the heck was that?

552
00:41:13.176 --> 00:41:16.260
Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.

553
00:41:16.343 --> 00:41:19.010
No, I mean you!
Why weren't you listening to anybody?


554
00:41:19.093 --> 00:41:22.343
Because I was trying to get us
into the building!


555
00:41:22.426 --> 00:41:23.968
That sure worked out well.

556
00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:27.051
I was doing everything right.
How could it go wrong?


557
00:41:27.135 --> 00:41:29.093
Because you weren't
listening to your team!


558
00:41:29.176 --> 00:41:31.843
You don't have
all the answers all the time!


559
00:41:31.926 --> 00:41:35.135
I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen. You said that.


560
00:41:35.218 --> 00:41:37.135
I was wrong.

561
00:41:37.718 --> 00:41:38.551
What?

562
00:41:38.635 --> 00:41:40.843
You're impulsive, you're arrogant,

563
00:41:40.926 --> 00:41:45.426
and you don't see that every decision
you make could cost someone their life.


564
00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:48.968
You want to know what really happens
to your brothers in the future?


565
00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:53.176
They die.
Everybody dies fighting the Krang.


566
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:56.593
The world needs Master Leonardo.

567
00:41:57.176 --> 00:41:59.260
And all we got is this guy.

568
00:42:11.635 --> 00:42:15.510
We have an update
on the strange situation at Metro Tower.


569
00:42:15.593 --> 00:42:18.843
<i>All contact has been lost
with those inside the building,</i>


570
00:42:18.926 --> 00:42:20.551
<i>and conflicting reports suggest</i>

571
00:42:20.635 --> 00:42:24.135
<i>something is barricading entrance
for emergency personnel.</i>


572
00:42:36.218 --> 00:42:37.426
Fools.

573
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:41.260
These creatures should
welcome the power of the Krang.


574
00:42:41.343 --> 00:42:45.051
<i>You on the rooftop!
Stop and surrender immediately!</i>


575
00:42:45.135 --> 00:42:48.551
We've got eyes on the roof top
where the police are confronting...


576
00:42:48.635 --> 00:42:49.718
What is that?

577
00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:52.551
You may begin.

578
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:05.718
Oh look! Okay! Wait!

579
00:43:07.801 --> 00:43:08.801
Look out!

580
00:43:25.718 --> 00:43:27.635
Mmm.

581
00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:43.968
Look,

582
00:43:44.593 --> 00:43:47.885
I know I'm not the Leo you knew
in the future, and maybe I never will be.


583
00:43:47.968 --> 00:43:50.635
This whole time
I was sure my family needed me,


584
00:43:50.718 --> 00:43:52.926
but the truth is I need them.

585
00:43:53.426 --> 00:43:56.635
If we're gonna survive this,
we have to do it together.


586
00:44:09.176 --> 00:44:14.843
<i>Hull integrity, 4%.
Breach imminent. Good luck.</i>


587
00:44:15.426 --> 00:44:18.426
Whew, good.
We have an imminent amount of time.


588
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.843
"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.

589
00:44:23.718 --> 00:44:27.218
Don't worry.
I'll save us with my mystic hands.


590
00:44:34.176 --> 00:44:35.176
Ah?

591
00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:38.301
Casey must have been wrong about me.

592
00:44:41.218 --> 00:44:42.760
This is it, Donnie.

593
00:44:42.843 --> 00:44:44.718
We're gonna get crushed!

594
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.426
- Knock-knock!
- April?


595
00:44:48.551 --> 00:44:50.801
Anyone order a rescue?

596
00:44:58.676 --> 00:45:00.676
Boom goes the herbicide!

597
00:45:09.176 --> 00:45:10.301
April!

598
00:45:11.135 --> 00:45:12.301
You saved us!

599
00:45:12.385 --> 00:45:14.426
Uncomfortable with emotion!

600
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.260
Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?

601
00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:19.343
Somewhere in there.

602
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.760
Faster! They're this way.

603
00:45:22.843 --> 00:45:25.260
I can smell them.

604
00:45:25.343 --> 00:45:28.343
She found us! We gotta move now.

605
00:45:30.801 --> 00:45:33.718
Oh man,
is this what the future looks like?


606
00:45:33.801 --> 00:45:36.968
Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.

607
00:45:37.551 --> 00:45:39.343
Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?

608
00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:40.926
<i>Come in, Leo.</i>

609
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.426
Donnie, where are you?

610
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.426
We've extracted from the subway
and are ascending a staircase.


611
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.176
I'm getting a lot of interference,
but if you hold still,


612
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.510
I can triangulate your position
using a complex geo-location algorithm.


613
00:45:51.593 --> 00:45:54.926
- Uh, Donnie?
- Odd numbers, primes, no... almost.


614
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.968
Almost!

615
00:45:57.843 --> 00:46:00.676
Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.

616
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.968
Man, I am so
glad you guys aren't dead.

617
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:05.051
Ditto.

618
00:46:06.218 --> 00:46:09.551
Okay, before this gets too mushy,
we need to locate Raph.


619
00:46:09.635 --> 00:46:11.593
Can you tell me
if he's in the building?

620
00:46:11.676 --> 00:46:14.218
Bet your momma's
subatomic particles I can.


621
00:46:14.718 --> 00:46:17.010
Got him! He's close.

622
00:46:17.093 --> 00:46:18.760
He's almost on top of us.

623
00:46:18.843 --> 00:46:20.801
Wait, he is on top of us.

624
00:46:24.176 --> 00:46:25.176
Raph!

625
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.760
Quick, cut him down,
get him out of there.

626
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.760
Huh?

627
00:46:38.843 --> 00:46:41.176
Hang on. We got you. Almost there.

628
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.510
Raph?

629
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.010
Ah.

630
00:47:23.968 --> 00:47:25.426
Surprise.

631
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.968
What did you do to my brother?

632
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:29.468
Improved him.

633
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.843
Thank you for this.
We will be putting it to good use.


634
00:47:53.926 --> 00:47:57.635
Come, the world awaits destruction.

635
00:47:59.718 --> 00:48:01.176
Tear them apart!

636
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:13.051
We gotta move.

637
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.468
- Leo, move!
- No!


638
00:48:30.968 --> 00:48:34.426
A shame our brethren
didn't survive the prison dimension.


639
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:40.510
Then again, their weakness
has no place in my new Krang empire.


640
00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:50.260
Open and bring unto this world

641
00:48:50.343 --> 00:48:53.510
the mighty power of Krang!

642
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:38.968
<i>Warning! This is a warning!</i>

643
00:49:39.051 --> 00:49:41.385
<i>...appears to be something
falling from the sky...</i>


644
00:49:42.468 --> 00:49:43.468
What?

645
00:49:44.176 --> 00:49:45.176
Oh!

646
00:50:21.968 --> 00:50:22.968
Begin!

647
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.843
What do we do now?

648
00:51:10.926 --> 00:51:15.760
I fear we are lost.
The Krang are too powerful.


649
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.260
Maybe we could
change the future some other way.


650
00:51:21.343 --> 00:51:25.801
Guys, it's time to face facts.
We can't change the future.


651
00:51:26.385 --> 00:51:27.385
Says who?

652
00:51:27.843 --> 00:51:31.093
Says the grandfather paradox,
says physical determinism,


653
00:51:31.176 --> 00:51:33.468
says the space-time continuum.

654
00:51:34.051 --> 00:51:36.385
Look, I didn't want
it to be true, but...

655
00:51:37.135 --> 00:51:39.093
...science.

656
00:51:39.176 --> 00:51:42.135
That's it! Donnie's wrong.

657
00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:45.260
The world is ending,
yet the barbs continue.


658
00:51:45.343 --> 00:51:48.635
Don't you remember?
We already did change the future.


659
00:51:48.718 --> 00:51:51.968
Raph never got kidnapped and
turned into a Krang zombie in your time.


660
00:51:52.051 --> 00:51:54.385
- Right, Casey?
- No, he didn't.


661
00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:59.343
- That means we did change the future!
- We're just in a different...


662
00:51:59.426 --> 00:52:01.385
Bifurcated time branch?

663
00:52:01.468 --> 00:52:03.468
Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.

664
00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:06.843
You know what that means, right?
We still have hope!


665
00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:09.385
A ninja's greatest weapon.

666
00:52:09.968 --> 00:52:11.260
Hey, I like that!

667
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.135
Look, I'm done
thinking I have all the answers.


668
00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:16.843
I don't know how to beat the Krang,

669
00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:22.176
but I do know our future
isn't written until we write it as a team.


670
00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.343
So what do we got?

671
00:52:25.468 --> 00:52:26.468
Maybe...

672
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.301
Maybe we don't have to beat them.

673
00:52:29.385 --> 00:52:31.801
Can't we just send them
back to the prison dimension?


674
00:52:31.885 --> 00:52:35.885
There's an idea! Donnie, what do those
big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?


675
00:52:35.968 --> 00:52:40.468
If we got control of their ship,
we could send it back through the portal.


676
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:43.135
Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?

677
00:52:43.718 --> 00:52:45.801
If someone on the ground
can get to that key...


678
00:52:45.885 --> 00:52:47.760
We can close the doorway.

679
00:52:47.843 --> 00:52:51.343
And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!

680
00:52:52.176 --> 00:52:56.843
Exactly. What do you say, Donnie?
You ready to fly a space ship?


681
00:52:57.426 --> 00:53:00.551
Literally the greatest question
I have ever been asked.


682
00:53:00.635 --> 00:53:04.176
All right, team, we have a plan.
Let's go save the world.


683
00:53:05.093 --> 00:53:07.593
Wait, but what about Raph?

684
00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:15.843
That big jerk may be
covered in goo and half alien,


685
00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:19.260
but he's still our brother,
and I'm not giving up on him.


686
00:53:19.343 --> 00:53:20.968
I'm not leaving him behind.

687
00:53:52.385 --> 00:53:54.093
There's the key. Let's go.

688
00:54:04.885 --> 00:54:06.801
Like Casey said, let's go!

689
00:54:12.385 --> 00:54:14.260
I wish my tech was working!

690
00:54:14.343 --> 00:54:16.718
Usually, my cardio is jetpack-assisted.

691
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:19.176
I'm not getting credit
for any of these steps!


692
00:54:28.968 --> 00:54:30.301
Eugh.

693
00:54:30.385 --> 00:54:33.385
Hey, question,
is it too late to join April's team?


694
00:54:33.468 --> 00:54:34.468
Sh.

695
00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:38.635
You two figure out
how to hijack this ship.


696
00:54:38.718 --> 00:54:40.176
I'm gonna find Raph.

697
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.218
So how do we hack this thing?

698
00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:50.343
Best guess, main console?

699
00:54:51.385 --> 00:54:53.385
Unfortunately, it's <i>ocupado.</i>

700
00:55:06.468 --> 00:55:08.176
Uh, new plan.

701
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.468
Run!

702
00:55:29.135 --> 00:55:31.760
Surprise. I've come for my brother.

703
00:55:34.218 --> 00:55:35.926
Let me guess.

704
00:55:36.718 --> 00:55:37.718
Duty.

705
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.301
He said doodie.

706
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:54.593
I see you got yourself an upgrade.

707
00:55:55.926 --> 00:55:58.301
You'll pay for what
you have done to me!

708
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.968
This psycho routine is a little thin.
Where's the character development?


709
00:56:11.635 --> 00:56:14.135
Leo's counting on us
to get to that key.


710
00:56:14.218 --> 00:56:15.676
I think I have an idea.

711
00:56:18.135 --> 00:56:19.135
Cover me!

712
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.926
Raph, you're coming with me,
whether you like it or not.


713
00:56:30.093 --> 00:56:33.051
I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.


714
00:56:35.343 --> 00:56:38.010
Oh, you will have to.

715
00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.718
Bravo, Mikey!

716
00:57:04.468 --> 00:57:07.260
There's no buttons,
or computers, or anything.


717
00:57:07.343 --> 00:57:10.343
Just a lot of drippy,
ooey-gooey disgustingness.


718
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.093
I don't know how to hack in...

719
00:57:13.635 --> 00:57:15.635
Oh God, I know
what I have to do.

720
00:57:15.718 --> 00:57:16.718
What?

721
00:57:18.801 --> 00:57:20.718
No, I don't think I can do this.

722
00:57:20.801 --> 00:57:22.926
What are you talking about?

723
00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:23.843
Oh no!

724
00:57:23.926 --> 00:57:26.843
That's... so gross!

725
00:57:26.926 --> 00:57:28.635
- I can't do it.
- I believe in you!


726
00:57:28.718 --> 00:57:31.176
- No, it's my worst nightmare.
- I know.


727
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.010
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

728
00:57:40.718 --> 00:57:44.676
Raph, I know you're in there somewhere.
You've gotta snap out of this!


729
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.718
Do you feel what
the power of the Krang can do?


730
00:57:48.801 --> 00:57:53.010
I am saving this weak planet!

731
00:57:53.093 --> 00:57:55.676
I am a gift!

732
00:58:13.843 --> 00:58:16.843
It's not working.
I need more of a connection.


733
00:58:17.426 --> 00:58:19.343
Mikey, take off my battle shell.

734
00:58:19.426 --> 00:58:22.343
No, you're too vulnerable
with just your soft shell.


735
00:58:24.385 --> 00:58:26.260
There's no time, hurry.

736
00:58:44.385 --> 00:58:46.135
Donnie?

737
00:58:56.801 --> 00:59:00.426
Mikey, I am...

738
00:59:01.218 --> 00:59:03.010
a spaceship!

739
00:59:03.593 --> 00:59:05.218
Oh! Ah!

740
00:59:09.218 --> 00:59:11.218
I'm trying to save you, you idiot!

741
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:13.635
Why do you have
to make things so hard?

742
00:59:21.718 --> 00:59:22.718
Ah.

743
00:59:24.843 --> 00:59:28.510
You want to keep coming at me?
Go ahead. I'm done fighting you.


744
00:59:33.593 --> 00:59:34.593
What?

745
00:59:40.676 --> 00:59:41.676
No!

746
00:59:50.801 --> 00:59:54.218
Finally, man and machine

747
00:59:54.301 --> 00:59:58.843
entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!

748
01:00:04.218 --> 01:00:08.510
How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!

749
01:00:28.385 --> 01:00:29.926
Donnie, Mikey!

750
01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.926
I don't want to fight anymore.

751
01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:44.676
I was fighting you
because I didn't understand you,


752
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760
but now I get it.

753
01:00:50.801 --> 01:00:54.176
I always figured you were mad because
you didn't like the way I did things.


754
01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.843
But when I see what's happening to you,

755
01:01:04.926 --> 01:01:06.635
and what's happening to them...

756
01:01:07.343 --> 01:01:09.593
I realized it wasn't about me.

757
01:01:09.676 --> 01:01:13.926
You didn't yell because you were mad,
you yelled because you were scared.


758
01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.260
It's scary to be responsible
for the lives you protect.


759
01:01:17.343 --> 01:01:20.926
Your team... your family,

760
01:01:21.676 --> 01:01:25.385
but we do it anyway
because that's what it means to be a hero.


761
01:01:27.635 --> 01:01:31.051
If this is it,
I want you to know I finally understand.


762
01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:33.968
And I'm sorry.

763
01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:54.801
Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back!
Your family needs you.


764
01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.510
- Leo?
- Yes!


765
01:02:14.385 --> 01:02:16.885
Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.

766
01:02:16.968 --> 01:02:19.885
Raph's doing it for us,
so we do it for him.


767
01:02:20.801 --> 01:02:22.926
That alien jerkface thinks we're weak

768
01:02:24.468 --> 01:02:26.593
because he hasn't seen what we can do...

769
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:30.593
when we fight together!

770
01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:37.760
It's pointless to resist Krang.

771
01:02:38.343 --> 01:02:39.343
Give up!

772
01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:43.843
You will be consumed like
everyone else on this pathetic planet!


773
01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.843
Fat chance.

774
01:02:45.926 --> 01:02:48.468
We're not like
everyone else on this planet.


775
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:49.968
We are...

776
01:02:50.051 --> 01:02:51.718
...the Teenage...

777
01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.635
- ...Mutant...
- ...Ninja...


778
01:02:54.635 --> 01:02:55.635
...Turtles!

779
01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:35.343
If this isn't the poster shot,
someone's getting fired.


780
01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:38.176
Oh, we are not done yet.

781
01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:45.301
April O'Neil!

782
01:03:46.551 --> 01:03:48.176
That's payback.

783
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.260
Keep her under that building
until I bring it down.


784
01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:06.885
Yeah!

785
01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.343
Casey, get out of there!

786
01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.551
Commander O'Neil!

787
01:04:39.635 --> 01:04:40.843
Nice shot.

788
01:04:43.718 --> 01:04:47.510
Donnie's almost got the ship to
the other side. I have to get to the key.


789
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:50.551
See ya.

790
01:04:53.051 --> 01:04:55.926
Come in, Sensei, it's Casey.
Can you hear me?


791
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.218
Come in, Sensei! 
Can you hear me?

792
01:05:07.718 --> 01:05:08.718
Ya!

793
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260
Ah!

794
01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.176
Okay! Donnie!

795
01:05:33.468 --> 01:05:34.801
Cowabunga!

796
01:05:37.385 --> 01:05:39.051
Flip-o-rama!

797
01:05:40.468 --> 01:05:41.718
Let's roll.

798
01:05:51.135 --> 01:05:53.510
Ka-zoom!

799
01:06:14.093 --> 01:06:15.176
Raph, go.

800
01:06:15.843 --> 01:06:16.843
On it!

801
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.593
Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!

802
01:06:28.676 --> 01:06:32.010
This is not a hug. 
It's a rescue!

803
01:06:38.343 --> 01:06:40.635
Where are we? Staten Island?

804
01:06:40.718 --> 01:06:42.676
Oh, gross.

805
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.468
So how would everyone rate
that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?


806
01:06:46.551 --> 01:06:49.885
Very unsatisfied?
Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?


807
01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:51.676
Donnie.

808
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.260
Leo's still up there.

809
01:07:16.468 --> 01:07:18.135
Casey. Casey, come in.

810
01:07:20.968 --> 01:07:24.760
Sensei, I'm here.
And I've got eyes on the key.


811
01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:29.635
Tell me when you're home free,
and I'll pull the plug.


812
01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:39.051
Casey, listen to me.

813
01:07:39.135 --> 01:07:41.468
When I get to the other side,
you close that door.


814
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:44.635
What? Sensei, no!

815
01:07:46.135 --> 01:07:49.051
<i>Casey, it's the only way.
He's too strong.</i>


816
01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:52.718
<i>He's not gonna stay on the other side
unless I keep him there.</i>


817
01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:55.260
<i>There has to be another way!</i>

818
01:07:55.343 --> 01:07:58.260
<i>We tried everything, Case.
This is the only way.</i>


819
01:07:59.635 --> 01:08:02.135
Leo, please don't do this! Leo!

820
01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.051
<i>You're one to talk, big bro.
Hero moves are totally your style.</i>


821
01:08:11.676 --> 01:08:15.968
Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.

822
01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:17.051
For what?

823
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.885
Honor, redemption?

824
01:08:20.468 --> 01:08:24.510
Sacrifice? All meaningless.

825
01:08:25.385 --> 01:08:27.093
We'll see about that.

826
01:08:47.093 --> 01:08:50.260
<i>Leo, please!
I can't lose you again.</i>


827
01:08:50.843 --> 01:08:55.051
<i>Hey, future me would be real
proud of you. I'm proud of you.</i>


828
01:08:55.135 --> 01:08:58.176
Weak words, weak actions.

829
01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:02.843
I have forever known
what you fail to understand,


830
01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:06.510
strength always prevails!

831
01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:11.260
What you fail to understand
is I missed on purpose.


832
01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:18.760
No, enough of your little tricks.

833
01:09:21.093 --> 01:09:23.010
Casey, close the portal now.

834
01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:24.385
What?

835
01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:37.010
No! Let go of me!

836
01:09:37.093 --> 01:09:38.843
Casey, please.

837
01:10:15.218 --> 01:10:17.218
You've been portal chopped.

838
01:10:36.385 --> 01:10:37.385
You...

839
01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:45.510
You've ruined everything!

840
01:10:45.593 --> 01:10:51.676
And now... my wrath
will be reserved for you alone.


841
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:57.801
You think you've won,
you wretched little pest?


842
01:11:16.718 --> 01:11:19.468
Wipe that grin off your face!

843
01:12:30.676 --> 01:12:33.093
Mikey, it's over.

844
01:12:33.801 --> 01:12:36.260
Leo never gave up on us.

845
01:12:36.343 --> 01:12:39.260
I'm not giving up on him.

846
01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:49.801
Whoa. Mikey,
whatever you're doing, don't stop!


847
01:12:57.968 --> 01:13:00.676
We're here, Mikey. Together.

848
01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:23.301
Took you guys long enough.

849
01:13:32.468 --> 01:13:33.468
Leo!

850
01:14:06.468 --> 01:14:08.343
Huh?

851
01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:10.218
<i>-</i>Leo?
- Hey.


852
01:14:11.301 --> 01:14:15.093
Eww! Are we in Staten Island?

853
01:14:15.176 --> 01:14:17.010
- Come here!
- Aww!


854
01:14:28.093 --> 01:14:30.093
No pictures.

855
01:14:46.551 --> 01:14:49.676
So this is "grabbing a slice"?

856
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.801
I don't get it.

857
01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:52.468
Wait for it.

858
01:14:54.676 --> 01:14:56.010
Mmm.

859
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:58.343
So much better than rats!

860
01:14:58.426 --> 01:14:59.426
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.


861
01:14:59.968 --> 01:15:03.801
Hey, the rest of the world we saved
is pretty great too.


862
01:15:03.885 --> 01:15:06.301
All right, everybody, look up here.

863
01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:17.260
April, you just got a message
from someone named "Cassandra."


864
01:15:19.135 --> 01:15:20.343
Whoa!

865
01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.176
Looks like our friend Cassandra
has been busy.


866
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:25.926
That's my mom!

867
01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:28.176
There goes the space-time continuum.

868
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.760
You did it, little brother.

869
01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:32.718
You really did it.

870
01:15:33.426 --> 01:15:34.426
I'm proud of you.

871
01:15:35.718 --> 01:15:37.176
This wasn't about me.

872
01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.801
It was about all of us
doing what needed to be done


873
01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:42.135
because we're heroes.

874
01:15:42.218 --> 01:15:45.510
You said "heroes."

875
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:54.426
There it is, gentlemen, our home.

876
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:55.926
What a town.

877
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.051
Beautiful.

878
01:15:57.676 --> 01:16:01.760
And if it needs defending,
we'll always rise to the challenge.


879
01:16:02.385 --> 01:16:06.176
Speaking of which,
you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?


880
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.468
- Beating that record!
- Yay!


881
01:16:08.551 --> 01:16:11.010
No way! No, okay, fine.

882
01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:14.635
All right, Big Raphie, let's do it!

883
01:16:14.718 --> 01:16:20.218
Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
