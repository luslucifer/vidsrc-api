00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.759
<i>In New York City, there's
a fine line between law and chaos.</i>


2
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.625
<i>On that line
live Danson and Highsmith.</i>


3
00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.358
Tell me again
why I decided to get on this roof!


4
00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:04.740
I think you can chalk that up
to bad life choices.


5
00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.050
Get rid of that asshole.

6
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.093
- Uh-oh!
- I hate it when you say "uh-oh"!


7
00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.571
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

8
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.668
Come on with it, then!

9
00:01:47.283 --> 00:01:49.080
Whoa, hey!

10
00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.290
That's trouble.

11
00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:15.433
Did someone call
Nine-One-holy-shit?


12
00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:27.688
That's it.
I'm sick of all this running.


13
00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:36.690
Hang on!

14
00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:53.082
You have the right to remain silent!

15
00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:56.210
But I wanna hear you scream!

16
00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:12.793
Down on the ground!

17
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:15.297
Detective!
Yeah, yeah! Detective!


18
00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:18.031
One at a time, all right?

19
00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:22.401
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,
New York Observer Online.


20
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.446
These suspects were caught
with only a quarter pound of marijuana,


21
00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:26.947
a misdemeanor in some states.

22
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.281
Do you think this arrest was worth
$12 million in property damages?


23
00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:33.717
Why don't we let New York City
answer that question?


24
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.281
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

25
00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:42.829
Hi, Sarah Gapone
from TMZ print edition.


26
00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:46.493
Danson, are the rumors about
you and Kim Kardashian true?


27
00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:48.161
No comment.

28
00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:50.003
But, yes.

29
00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:55.066
Danson and Highsmith,
free hot dogs for life!


30
00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:02.678
No drinks. No drinks.
I can't do it. I can't do it.


31
00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.480
<i>Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive,
and sex with style. They're rock stars.</i>


32
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.583
<i>Then you got your jokers,
your ball busters, your vets...</i>


33
00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:14.595
<i>...and the other guys.</i>

34
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.526
We know, we know. We know.

35
00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:22.798
All right, all right, all right.
Listen up, listen up!


36
00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.433
We're having a celebration
tonight at Butter.


37
00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.103
Brody Jenner's gonna be there.
Bai Ling.


38
00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:31.976
<i>- That little short bitch
from Jersey Shore. - Yeah!</i>


39
00:04:32.048 --> 00:04:35.142
And most of you are on the list.

40
00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:37.152
You're the best.

41
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.188
Guys, I'm gonna say something
right now.


42
00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.655
It's about a man who came
from Austria with a dream.


43
00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:44.557
- Arnold Schwarzenegger!
- Let me finish.


44
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:47.027
He became a champion
and then a movie star, all right?


45
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.291
- Arnold Schwarzenegger!
- God damn it, let me...


46
00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.299
They ruined the story.
They ruined the story.


47
00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.994
Let... What... The point is,

48
00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.163
we couldn't do our job if it weren't
for you guys doing all the paperwork,


49
00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.537
answering the phones, and all that
stupid shit that we don't like to do.


50
00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:00.632
All the gun fights,
all the car chases,


51
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.578
all the sex we don't wanna have
with women, but we have to,


52
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:08.344
all due to what you guys do.
Thank you.


53
00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:09.680
And we'd do it again and again.

54
00:05:09.752 --> 00:05:12.050
Hey, you shut your face!

55
00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:13.349
If we wanna hear you talk,

56
00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.324
I will shove my arm up your ass
and work your mouth like a puppet!


57
00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:18.084
You hear me? You hear me?

58
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:20.561
- Cash bar.
- Yeah.


59
00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:22.494
Peace out, bitches.

60
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.835
Hey, fellas.
All right, bring it in.


61
00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:28.393
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

62
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:30.662
All right, right there.

63
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.708
Just back up,
just like right there.


64
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:35.402
All right, just one...
Just a...


65
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:37.240
There you go, right there.
Right there.


66
00:05:37.847 --> 00:05:39.906
This is their paperwork.
You know they're not gonna do it.


67
00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:43.213
That's right.
This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.


68
00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.949
It's thick, ugly,
got Danson's fingerprints all over it.


69
00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:48.455
- No offense, Bob.
- That's all right.


70
00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:50.685
- Anyway, now who wants it?
- I do!


71
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.422
All right! Paper Bitch
and Yankee Clipper on the case!


72
00:05:54.197 --> 00:05:55.596
- Nice work. Thanks, Allen.
- Thank you, Captain.


73
00:05:55.698 --> 00:05:56.960
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

74
00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:09.136
Stop humming that song!

75
00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.971
- I can hum if I want to.
- No, I know you can.


76
00:06:13.082 --> 00:06:14.310
I'm asking you to stop.

77
00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:16.642
- Well, if you're asking,
then I'll stop. - Thank you.


78
00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:23.750
Could you not smile like that?

79
00:06:24.327 --> 00:06:26.300
Now you're asking me
to mask my emotions


80
00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:27.661
because of how
it makes you feel.


81
00:06:27.764 --> 00:06:29.561
That I will not do.

82
00:06:33.403 --> 00:06:36.236
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

83
00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:38.330
This isn't accounting
or wherever the hell


84
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.774
you and your little pocket calculator
were transferred from.


85
00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:44.813
Forensic accounting, okay.
And it's an important part of the job.


86
00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:48.975
Yeah, whatever. Stop being so overtly
happy about doing shit work, you moron.


87
00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:50.950
Hey, guys. Reminder.

88
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.251
The police union picnic's
coming up this weekend.


89
00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:58.953
My wife's making her famous deviled
eggs, again. My waistline's furious.


90
00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:00.427
It's a bad time, Bob!

91
00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:03.525
All right.

92
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.192
Going to get a slice.

93
00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:18.643
You know what I just did?

94
00:07:18.714 --> 00:07:21.012
I just walked out that door,
saw a couple detectives,


95
00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:23.608
and I was about to start
bad mouthing you behind your back,


96
00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:25.881
but I stopped myself,
because my pops taught me


97
00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:28.616
that a man who talks
behind somebody's back is a coward.


98
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:29.885
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

99
00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:31.789
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you
directly to your face.


100
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.625
- No. You don't have to.
- No, I don't like you.


101
00:07:34.697 --> 00:07:36.130
I think you're a fake cop.

102
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.965
The sound of your piss hitting
the urinal? It sounds feminine.


103
00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:42.800
If we were in the wild,
I would attack you.


104
00:07:42.872 --> 00:07:47.571
Even if you weren't in my food chain,
I would go out of my way to attack you.


105
00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:49.235
If I were a lion,
and you were a tuna,


106
00:07:49.345 --> 00:07:51.939
I would swim out in the middle
of the ocean and freaking eat you!


107
00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.407
And then I'd bang
your tuna girlfriend.


108
00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:59.852
Okay, first off,
a lion swimming in the ocean?


109
00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:01.116
Lions don't like water.

110
00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:04.560
If you'd placed it near a river
or some sort of fresh water source,


111
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:05.555
that'd make sense.

112
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:07.893
But you find yourself in the ocean,

113
00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:09.727
I'm assuming
it's off the coast of South Africa,


114
00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:13.615
coming up against a full-grown,

115
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.367
with his 20 or 30 friends?

116
00:08:15.438 --> 00:08:16.598
You lose that battle.

117
00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:19.607
You lose that battle nine times
out of ten. And guess what?


118
00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.805
You've wandered
into our school of tuna,


119
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.976
and we now have a taste
of lion.


120
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.480
We've talked to ourselves.
We've communicated.


121
00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:27.742
- Yeah?
- And said, "You know what?


122
00:08:27.817 --> 00:08:30.980
Lion tastes good.
Let's go get some more lion".


123
00:08:31.087 --> 00:08:33.647
We've developed a system
to establish a beachhead


124
00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:36.657
and aggressively
hunt you and your family.


125
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.920
And we will corner your pride,

126
00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.895
- your children, your offspring.
- How you gonna do that?


127
00:08:40.963 --> 00:08:44.558
We will construct a series
of breathing apparatus with kelp.


128
00:08:44.634 --> 00:08:47.125
We will be able to trap
certain amounts of oxygen.


129
00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:51.673
It's not gonna be days at a time,
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.


130
00:08:51.774 --> 00:08:54.436
That will give us enough time
to figure out where you live,


131
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.604
go back to the sea, get more oxygen,
and then stalk you.


132
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.172
You just lost at your own game.
You're outgunned and outmanned.


133
00:09:04.654 --> 00:09:07.248
Did that go
the way you thought it was gonna go?


134
00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:08.449
Nope.

135
00:09:16.032 --> 00:09:17.624
Two minutes before the markets open,

136
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.965
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global,
ringing the opening bell.


137
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.638
<i>With Boardman is investment banker,
David Ershon,</i>


138
00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:27.164
<i>who manages 40%
of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.</i>


139
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:30.109
How much did we lose?

140
00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:32.477
You may ring the bell now,
Ms. Boardman.


141
00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:34.641
- $32.
- Million?


142
00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.947
No, billion.

143
00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:40.488
Shit!

144
00:09:41.257 --> 00:09:45.660
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members.
I popped two of them off the draw.


145
00:09:45.828 --> 00:09:47.523
- Bang, bang.
- Yeah.


146
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.222
Then I raise up
to take the leader out.


147
00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:50.822
Shit, I feel like I'm there now.

148
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.095
I hear a whistle.
My partner's on the roof.


149
00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:55.500
He says, "Let's even the odds"!

150
00:09:55.805 --> 00:10:00.003
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump.
I send one through his chest.


151
00:10:01.043 --> 00:10:02.567
Game over, bitches.

152
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.342
- All right.
- Yeah.


153
00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:11.946
Jimmy? Let's talk about
how that story made you feel.


154
00:10:12.521 --> 00:10:14.011
Like my cock was made
out of concrete.


155
00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:17.258
I know it's very tempting.

156
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.421
You want to impress your friends.

157
00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:22.086
But this is serious stuff
we're dealing with, okay?


158
00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:25.599
This is firing your weapon
in the line of duty.


159
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:26.759
Officer Hoitz?

160
00:10:27.403 --> 00:10:28.734
Oh, man.

161
00:10:28.804 --> 00:10:29.964
- Come on!
- Here we go.


162
00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.438
Would you like to share?

163
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.666
No, I'd rather not.

164
00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:35.409
Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here
for six months now,


165
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:37.274
and you haven't said a word.

166
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:39.712
This is a safe room,
no judgment here.


167
00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:40.874
Jerkoff.

168
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.248
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

169
00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:44.845
I relive it every night.

170
00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:48.122
<i>Bronx, October.</i>

171
00:10:48.224 --> 00:10:50.021
<i>Game 7 of the World Series.</i>

172
00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:53.357
For all the marbles. High pressure,
unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.


173
00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:56.262
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure
in the tunnel. I told him to stop.


174
00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:58.265
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
this is a restricted area!


175
00:10:58.367 --> 00:10:59.698
<i>Finally pulled my gun.</i>

176
00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.066
Pulled a deadly weapon.
He started running at me.


177
00:11:01.137 --> 00:11:03.037
Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!

178
00:11:04.273 --> 00:11:06.138
Are you deaf?
You hear me yell, "Freeze"?


179
00:11:06.242 --> 00:11:09.370
You dick! I'm Derek Jeter!
You shot me!


180
00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:12.209
- You cost me 20 grand on that game!
- Douche bag.


181
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:13.748
Cost the city a championship.

182
00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:16.148
I was being groomed
for a top position in homicide.


183
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:17.990
Now I'm stuck
with a desk jockey partner.


184
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:19.116
Everybody calls me
the Yankee Clipper.


185
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:20.882
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

186
00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.253
He's a biracial angel.

187
00:11:22.324 --> 00:11:23.985
You should've shot A
-Rod.

188
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.965
Yo, Paper Bitch.

189
00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:34.996
- What's up, man?
- Hey. Hey, guys.


190
00:11:35.104 --> 00:11:36.799
- Paper Bitch.
- Paper Bitch.


191
00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:37.964
I don't like that, actually.

192
00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:39.837
I know you guys think it's fun,
but I don't like that name.


193
00:11:39.942 --> 00:11:41.500
Still working on
the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?


194
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.669
- Shit.
- No, actually, actually, that's...


195
00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:45.144
What is this? That looks stupid.

196
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:47.910
- Guys, it's illegal permitting
for construction. - Wow!


197
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:48.843
Specifically, scaffolding.

198
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:50.475
Some of the guys were talking.

199
00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:51.530
They were like,

200
00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:53.347
"How come you've never fired
your weapon in the office before?"


201
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:54.150
Good point.

202
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.221
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

203
00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:57.758
You've never fired your weapon
in the office.


204
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.987
We all have, you know.
It's called a desk pop.


205
00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:02.758
Fellas, look, I know you don't
respect me as a police officer.


206
00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:03.991
- Not true.
- I'm not stupid.


207
00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:06.534
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm
in the office.


208
00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:08.194
Gamble, listen to me.
I'll try to make it real clear.


209
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.915
We honor the flag,
and you crap on it


210
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.435
when you don't shoot
your gun in the office.


211
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:14.600
Jimmy. When's the last time
you had a desk pop?


212
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.337
September '08.

213
00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:18.775
- Be a man. Do it.
- Now.


214
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.542
- Please, please, do it.
- Pop one off!


215
00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:22.709
- There you go. Pop it off!
- Don't think, just go!


216
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.343
- Here we go.
- Do it, yes.


217
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:27.013
He did it!

218
00:12:27.123 --> 00:12:28.954
Hey! Shots fired!

219
00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:32.186
Hey, Terry, I did it!
I did my first desk pop!


220
00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:34.253
It's a real thing, right?

221
00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:35.853
- A desk pop?
- Yeah.


222
00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.057
No, that's not real!

223
00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:41.092
They were so convincing in their
argument, they swung me.


224
00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:45.937
All right, Allen, you're gonna
have to hand over your gun.


225
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:47.133
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:49.105
Captain, you really wanna
disarm this guy,


227
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.237
take out the batteries
in the calculator.


228
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.195
All right,
I'm gonna give you this.


229
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.715
This is a dummy gun.
I use it for ceremony.


230
00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:56.844
There.

231
00:12:57.286 --> 00:13:00.881
You get this back
when I feel you know how to handle it.


232
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.153
Listen, guys. I'm working two jobs.
I'm working here.


233
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:08.424
And I got another job
at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?


234
00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:11.125
I'm doing that
just to put a kid through NYU


235
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.966
so he can explore his bisexuality
and become a deejay.


236
00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:18.495
Now the last thing I need
is a ballistics report in the unit.


237
00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:20.973
I'm just gonna ask you guys,
please, come on, really.


238
00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:22.806
Just think about...
Just be smart.


239
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:53.808
<i>211 in progress.</i>

240
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:56.970
<i>They're using a wrecking ball
to clean out Castien Jewelry.</i>


241
00:13:57.046 --> 00:13:58.479
All right, we got it.

242
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:00.879
- Good luck, guys. Have a good one.
- Allen, let's go.


243
00:14:00.983 --> 00:14:03.850
- No, I got work to do.
- What? This is work!


244
00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:07.514
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith.
We roll in heavy.


245
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.921
You cream puffs, sit tight.

246
00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:10.355
You gotta be shitting me!

247
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.522
You can't keep me
cooped up in here, okay?


248
00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:16.690
I am a peacock!
You gotta let me fly!


249
00:14:22.872 --> 00:14:25.067
Did he just...
Did he just call himself a peacock?


250
00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:29.839
Let's go! Let's go!

251
00:14:32.882 --> 00:14:33.940
Come on, fellas!

252
00:14:34.183 --> 00:14:36.583
Wednesday night is taco night
at Rikers Island!


253
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.059
That's the second one this week!

254
00:14:53.402 --> 00:14:55.427
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

255
00:14:56.105 --> 00:14:57.231
Let's go!

256
00:14:58.073 --> 00:14:59.131
Yeah!

257
00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:00.902
Heads up!

258
00:15:01.243 --> 00:15:02.369
Shit.

259
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.550
Special Forces zipline.

260
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.923
Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!

261
00:15:21.163 --> 00:15:23.427
- These guys are pros.
- Let's go!


262
00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:24.898
You thinking
what I'm thinking, partner?


263
00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:26.593
Aim for the bushes.

264
00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:57.859
<i>Cops still argue to this day
why Danson and Highsmith jumped.</i>


265
00:15:57.967 --> 00:16:01.926
<i>Maybe it was just pride, having
survived so many brushes with death.</i>


266
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:04.165
<i>Maybe their egos pushed them off.</i>

267
00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:06.969
<i>I don't know.
But that shit was crazy.</i>


268
00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:10.185
<i>Either way, there was a hole
in New York City,</i>


269
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.776
and it needed to be filled.

270
00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:14.145
<i>Two days ago,
this city wept.</i>


271
00:16:14.216 --> 00:16:18.175
<i>We lost two heroes
who gave everything for us,</i>


272
00:16:18.287 --> 00:16:20.545
who paid
that ultimate sacrifice


273
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.191
so that we may walk
these streets safely.


274
00:16:24.126 --> 00:16:25.684
There wasn't even an awning
in their direction.


275
00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:27.955
- No, I know.
- They just jumped 20 stories.


276
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.361
Doesn't make sense, does it?

277
00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:33.333
I only hope God lets them take their
.357s with them to heaven...


278
00:16:33.402 --> 00:16:36.735
It's our moment, Allen.
Our moment to step up and be the guys.


279
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.901
- We're at a funeral.
Show some respect. - What?


280
00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:43.235
You don't think every other detective
here isn't thinking the same thing?


281
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.141
Allen, listen to me.
Danson and Highsmith are gone.


282
00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:51.209
Their desks are empty.
Someone has to fill those seats.


283
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.847
That someone is us, okay?
The city's dying for a hero.


284
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.680
- Is it?
- Yeah.


285
00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:58.425
What about nine million

286
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.389
socially-conscious
and unified citizens,


287
00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:02.225
all just stepping up
and doing their part?


288
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:04.561
As a little kid, didn't you dress up
and play cops and robbers?


289
00:17:04.666 --> 00:17:06.827
I'll tell you
what I did as a little kid.


290
00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.234
I went to school and made my bed.

291
00:17:09.338 --> 00:17:11.932
And at age 11, 
I audited my parents.

292
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.340
And believe me, there were some
discrepancies, and I was grounded.


293
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:17.276
What the hell are you?

294
00:17:17.379 --> 00:17:20.348
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?


295
00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.130
Look at these two jamokes,
would you?


296
00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:24.513
One shot Jeter
and the other shot an office.


297
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.520
Have some decorum.
We're at a funeral.


298
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.787
You wanna dance, brolio?

299
00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:35.700
I will rock your body
with big, nasty hooks.


300
00:17:35.705 --> 00:17:37.128
You'll be pissing blood
out of your ass.


301
00:17:37.232 --> 00:17:38.290
That's horrible.

302
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.560
Why don't you step back, man?

303
00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:41.102
You touch him,
I swear to God


304
00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:43.034
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you
with Allen's head.


305
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.630
He's not gonna do that. That's
hyperbole. But that's a weird example.


306
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:47.538
- You wanna go?
- I wanna go!


307
00:17:48.944 --> 00:17:50.309
- Get him off.
- Kick his ass, Martin.


308
00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:52.140
Yeah. How do you like that?

309
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:55.073
- Pull his hair!
- I love it.


310
00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:56.945
This hurts so good.

311
00:17:57.886 --> 00:18:00.047
- Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- What a lovely hat.


312
00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:01.680
I love your shoes.

313
00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:03.781
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Go, go.


314
00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:05.552
Punish him!

315
00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:07.652
Oh, man.

316
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.298
Do it. That's how we
do it in the hood.

317
00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:11.593
- Punish him.
- That's not even a move.


318
00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:15.133
I'm the winner.
I'm the winner, everybody saw it.


319
00:18:15.237 --> 00:18:17.205
What the hell is going on here?

320
00:18:17.773 --> 00:18:19.331
Two good men are dead,

321
00:18:19.408 --> 00:18:22.502
and you guys are fighting over
who's gonna be the next hotshot?


322
00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:23.704
Is that what's happening?

323
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.336
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

324
00:18:26.582 --> 00:18:28.072
Let me tell you something.

325
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.081
- Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.
- Very sorry.


326
00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:32.486
- Sorry, Lorraine.
- Sorry, Lorraine.


327
00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:34.318
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

328
00:18:35.524 --> 00:18:37.185
- Too soon?
- Why'd you say that?


329
00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.351
I'll tell you something
about those guys.


330
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:44.024
They knew that to become a good cop,
you had to solve cases. Okay?


331
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:48.098
Okay, and maybe you start
with the Castien robbery.


332
00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:50.767
Okay? So just watch it.

333
00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.941
Next time, me, you, library.

334
00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:56.169
- Not even close.
- Come on, guys. Guys, come on.


335
00:18:56.912 --> 00:18:58.846
- You are...
- I'm the winner!


336
00:18:58.914 --> 00:19:02.179
I didn't need you to stick up for me,
okay? I could've handled that myself.


337
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:03.880
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

338
00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:05.949
It's the partner's code.
I had no choice.


339
00:19:06.054 --> 00:19:07.282
Move.

340
00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:19.461
- 9:15, let's have a great day,
everybody! - Cut the shit!


341
00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:27.669
Good morning.

342
00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:31.843
<i>We've got shots fired.

343
00:19:31.914 --> 00:19:33.848
<i>There are large amounts of cocaine
on the scene.</i>


344
00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:35.042
<i>Try to stay out of trouble,
boys.</i>


345
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.811
There's no chance
you'd wanna go on that call, right?


346
00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.716
No chance. Too busy.

347
00:19:38.987 --> 00:19:41.825
All right, ladies.
Starting to get the picture?


348
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.357
We're about to lock
shit down.


349
00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:45.416
- That's right. - You girls
stay here and get your type on.


350
00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:47.427
Go get them, guys.
Lot of energy, lot of focus.


351
00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:48.655
Shut up!

352
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.994
Allen, could I see you in the hallway
for a second?


353
00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.533
I... I'm super busy right now, Terry.

354
00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:54.501
No, no, no, I know.
This'll be real quick.


355
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.435
It's about the construction permits
you were talking about.


356
00:19:56.538 --> 00:19:58.529
- The scaffolding violations?
- This is our thing, yeah.


357
00:20:00.175 --> 00:20:01.733
So, what do you got?

358
00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:04.334
I got this!
I'll put one right in your neck.


359
00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:05.505
What are you doing?

360
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:08.277
Let's go.
We're going to that call.


361
00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:09.941
- What is this?
- Shut up.


362
00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:12.384
We're going to the car,
and we're going after this case.


363
00:20:12.454 --> 00:20:13.887
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- I won't?


364
00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:15.423
- No.
- I shot Jeter.


365
00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:17.685
- That was an accident.
- Was it?


366
00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.283
- Now move.
- Okay.


367
00:20:20.028 --> 00:20:21.359
Hey.

368
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.627
Does anybody see this?
He's got a gun on me.


369
00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:26.530
I'm being kidnapped.

370
00:20:26.602 --> 00:20:29.696
Really, we're in a police station
and no one is interested in this?


371
00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:32.305
- So, then what happened?
- What do you think happened?


372
00:20:32.407 --> 00:20:34.405
I woke up,
I took the belt off my neck,


373
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.775
and I got in my car,
and I got out of there.


374
00:20:35.877 --> 00:20:37.401
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

375
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:40.778
I thought I was gonna
have to shoot my way out.


376
00:20:40.882 --> 00:20:43.043
What are you gonna do, though,
you know? Bar mitzvahs.


377
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.285
What the hell is this?

378
00:20:47.389 --> 00:20:50.085
It's my car. It's a Prius.

379
00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:53.821
I feel like we're literally
driving around in a vagina.


380
00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:56.762
Detective Hoitz and Gamble
are on that 518 on East 10th.


381
00:20:56.832 --> 00:20:58.925
Negatory, Martin and Fosse,
two minutes out.


382
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:00.730
We'll just see who's there first.

383
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.498
You stay out of our crime scene!
You hear me?


384
00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:05.230
Go, go, go!

385
00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:08.337
You feel that, Allen?
That tingling in your balls?


386
00:21:08.443 --> 00:21:10.308
Big metal butterflies fluttering around
in your stomach?


387
00:21:10.412 --> 00:21:12.004
Are you sure
you don't have testicular cancer?


388
00:21:12.114 --> 00:21:14.139
I got something to get you going.

389
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.146
Let's go do some damage!

390
00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:21.817
Nope.

391
00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.319
What the hell is that?

392
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.788
LRB. Little River Band.

393
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.462
This music makes me feel like
I'm going shopping for a training bra.


394
00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:33.267
You know what?
We go with no music, okay?


395
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:34.461
- Fine.
- Say bye.


396
00:21:34.536 --> 00:21:35.662
No, no, no, don't say bye...

397
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:37.466
You just signed
your own death warrant, Hoitz!


398
00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:40.770
Allen, punch that accelerator
or I will shoot you in the foot!


399
00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.275
America!

400
00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:44.875
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

401
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:48.645
Seriously, slow the car down!
We're approaching the crime scene!


402
00:21:48.717 --> 00:21:49.809
Terry, I'm coming in.

403
00:21:49.885 --> 00:21:51.716
You're gonna smash
right through the tape! Allen!


404
00:21:52.054 --> 00:21:53.487
Dude! What...

405
00:21:58.694 --> 00:22:00.821
That's a lot of cocaine.

406
00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:04.789
Did you yell "America"
when you hit the accelerator?


407
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.663
Nope. No. No.

408
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:09.701
I've never actually put my foot
all the way down


409
00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:13.702
to the ground
with the accelerator like that.


410
00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:17.174
It got me slightly aroused.

411
00:22:19.715 --> 00:22:21.307
Here we go.

412
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:26.843
Way to put your stamp
on the crime scene, guys.


413
00:22:26.922 --> 00:22:29.356
- Prius, huh?
- Yep, yep.


414
00:22:29.424 --> 00:22:30.686
Good mileage?

415
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.158
- Outstanding.
- Yeah.


416
00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:34.821
Did this come with a dental dam?

417
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.430
- No.
- Get it?


418
00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:40.902
My Suburban shit
one of these last night.


419
00:22:41.002 --> 00:22:42.594
I didn't know
they put tampons on wheels.


420
00:22:44.206 --> 00:22:45.366
We've had our fun, huh?

421
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.409
Looks like Scarface
sneezed on your car.


422
00:22:49.177 --> 00:22:50.269
All right, everybody!

423
00:22:50.379 --> 00:22:53.405
I'm gonna need you all to back up now.
We're taking over.


424
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:55.915
"At the crime scene, LOL."

425
00:22:56.017 --> 00:22:57.712
- Good tweet, good tweet.
- Yeah, thanks.


426
00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:01.852
<i>America has always been defined
by its excess.</i>


427
00:23:03.058 --> 00:23:05.526
<i>The Grand Canyon,
professional sports contracts.</i>


428
00:23:05.594 --> 00:23:08.028
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.

429
00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:11.964
<i>I myself have 18 Lamborghinis</i>

430
00:23:13.135 --> 00:23:15.069
<i>and a Subaru station wagon.</i>

431
00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:18.271
And it's because of this excess
that I have flourished.


432
00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:21.968
I implore you, please,
do not stop profiting.


433
00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:25.774
Live for excess.
It's the American way.


434
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.617
Hello.

435
00:23:34.322 --> 00:23:37.485
Mr. Ershon?
I believe this call's for you.


436
00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:42.055
Sir David.

437
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.759
David. You're not returning my calls,
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.


438
00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:47.461
- G'day, mate.
- Hey.


439
00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:50.167
Roger and his team are gonna babysit
you because I don't trust you,


440
00:23:50.272 --> 00:23:51.534
because I think
you're going to take off.


441
00:23:52.307 --> 00:23:55.105
Pamela, this is ridiculous.
I'm not going anywhere.


442
00:23:55.177 --> 00:23:57.611
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies
come out on the 26th.


443
00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:59.200
You have until then
to give me my money.


444
00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:00.513
I'm not reporting any losses,
David.


445
00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:02.446
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

446
00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:04.430
<i>Well, then, you get their money,
make it disappear,</i>


447
00:24:04.435 --> 00:24:05.544
<i>and then pay us back.</i>

448
00:24:05.654 --> 00:24:08.953
Yes, yes, I'll tell him
he doesn't need to keep watching me.


449
00:24:09.024 --> 00:24:11.515
- David!
- Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.


450
00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:15.995
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman.
So, you're good to go.


451
00:24:16.465 --> 00:24:17.523
Heard everything, mate.

452
00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:18.891
Ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.494
guess who gave me the secrets
to making my first billion dollars.


454
00:24:25.407 --> 00:24:26.874
That man there.

455
00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:29.667
Go! Go!

456
00:24:29.978 --> 00:24:31.809
- Side!
- Step aside, please.


457
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:34.344
You don't think
I'm a real cop, do you?


458
00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:36.680
No, I don't. I've said that
directly to your face numerous times.


459
00:24:36.751 --> 00:24:37.877
I was really honest about that.

460
00:24:37.986 --> 00:24:40.477
I'm working on a huge case,
all right?


461
00:24:40.555 --> 00:24:42.682
Property owner with seven buildings
under construction.


462
00:24:42.757 --> 00:24:45.885
He hasn't applied
for a single scaffolding permit.


463
00:24:45.994 --> 00:24:47.585
Now, according to Ask Jeeves,

464
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.931
this perp is at the Plaza Hotel
speaking right now.


465
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:53.728
- That's your big case?
Scaffolding permits? - Yeah.


466
00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:57.065
Guess what?
You're coming with me.


467
00:24:57.839 --> 00:24:59.739
It's a wooden gun.

468
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.075
That hurts, man!

469
00:25:06.348 --> 00:25:08.450
I've always got Little River Band
loaded up here.


470
00:25:08.455 --> 00:25:10.217
I've got six disks in here.

471
00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:14.215
Claude, meet me outside,
at the back of the service entrance.


472
00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:16.757
I'm flying Air Singapore.

473
00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:18.553
- Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?
- She died.


474
00:25:18.627 --> 00:25:19.719
Attaboy!

475
00:25:19.794 --> 00:25:21.762
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

476
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.525
Another thing I hate about you?
You always pay in exact change.


477
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.898
You're just mad
because I have a nice change purse.


478
00:25:27.969 --> 00:25:29.095
Why do you even care?

479
00:25:29.204 --> 00:25:32.139
How can I help it? You know what?
You know what's worse?


480
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.265
The way you fart.
Even your farts, they're not manly.


481
00:25:34.376 --> 00:25:35.468
You're being ridiculous.

482
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:38.137
They sound like a baby blowing out
the candles on a birthday cake.


483
00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:39.543
- What?
- Like a little...


484
00:25:39.614 --> 00:25:41.479
- You know what bugs me about you?
- What?


485
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:42.914
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.

486
00:25:42.984 --> 00:25:46.317
<i>No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880.
Play of the week.</i>


487
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:48.753
You're like a child in a leather
jacket. That's what you're like.


488
00:25:48.823 --> 00:25:49.915
Get out of the way, man!

489
00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:51.891
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

490
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.258
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon,
but I don't bother with the...


491
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.165
Anyway, in little bit of a rush,
gentlemen,


492
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.596
if you don't mind.
Thank you.


493
00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:01.932
- Excuse me, but you're
under arrest, okay? - What?


494
00:26:02.003 --> 00:26:06.940
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can be used...


495
00:26:07.008 --> 00:26:09.135
- What's the next part?
- As a floatation device.


496
00:26:09.244 --> 00:26:10.734
As a floatation device.

497
00:26:10.812 --> 00:26:14.339
You know what? That's very funny.
I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.


498
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:16.246
- Really?
- Are you guys for real?


499
00:26:16.318 --> 00:26:17.410
Am I being punk'd?

500
00:26:18.553 --> 00:26:19.850
Detective Allen Gamble.

501
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:22.856
We are in a cocaine-covered car,
and we are bringing in a perp.


502
00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:25.756
- One David Ershon.
- 175 pounds.


503
00:26:25.827 --> 00:26:27.852
- Thank you. 175 pounds.
- Shut up, man, shut up!


504
00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:29.945
Martin and Fosse
are probably on Studio B


505
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.863
talking to Shepard Smith
right now.


506
00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:34.800
We arrest this jerkoff
for a scaffolding permit?


507
00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:37.099
Wait, wait, wait,
what am I being arrested for?


508
00:26:37.172 --> 00:26:39.037
For scaffolding permit violation...

509
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:49.949
- I got my insurance card. Somewhere.
- Easy, mate.


510
00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:52.384
- What the hell? You ran right into us!
- Stand over there.


511
00:26:52.954 --> 00:26:54.012
Wood?

512
00:26:54.556 --> 00:26:55.682
What the...

513
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.553
- Couldn't see the car.
It's big enough, mate. - What?


514
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.286
Do not let these men take me.

515
00:27:01.062 --> 00:27:02.154
Hi.

516
00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:04.788
Why's she looking at you like that?

517
00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:06.356
That's my car!

518
00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:10.199
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange
insurance information!


519
00:27:10.572 --> 00:27:12.130
Hey! Excuse me!

520
00:27:13.008 --> 00:27:15.408
Why did they take our shoes?

521
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.911
- What the hell just happened?
- Where's my iPhone?


522
00:27:20.081 --> 00:27:22.208
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.

523
00:27:22.317 --> 00:27:25.230
I don't get why we can't
just call the office


524
00:27:25.235 --> 00:27:27.346
and have a squad car
come pick us up.


525
00:27:27.422 --> 00:27:29.913
No. They took our shoes,
our guns, and our car.


526
00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:31.652
There's no way
that's going out on the radio.


527
00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:33.265
Look, if we're gonna do this
together,


528
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.156
there's some issues
we need to settle, okay?


529
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.825
I mean, you said I had a weak chin.
You said the way I pee is feminine.


530
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.094
How do you think that makes me feel?

531
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:45.264
I mean, that list you have, you put
a lot of thought in. It's weird.


532
00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:47.603
I hear you.

533
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:52.442
Let's clean the slate
right now. Fresh start.


534
00:27:52.547 --> 00:27:55.175
All right. Fresh start.

535
00:27:56.885 --> 00:28:00.446
Maybe we should call ourselves
the Febreze Brothers,


536
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:02.113
'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

537
00:28:03.692 --> 00:28:04.750
Right?

538
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.927
Let's do another fresh start, 'cause
I just wanted to punch you in the face.


539
00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:10.791
Fine, fresh start.

540
00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:12.696
It's the last one.

541
00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:14.701
I have to be able to express myself
and say things, you know.


542
00:28:17.639 --> 00:28:20.403
- Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!
- Listen up!


543
00:28:20.475 --> 00:28:22.409
Got a high profile kidnapping.

544
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.943
David Ershon, wealthy banker,
multinational team.


545
00:28:26.047 --> 00:28:28.072
Maybe a sleeper cell,
but it's too early to tell.


546
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:32.586
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your
shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.


547
00:28:32.654 --> 00:28:34.645
Who cares?
It's not important, okay?


548
00:28:34.756 --> 00:28:37.281
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

549
00:28:39.227 --> 00:28:40.888
- Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.


550
00:28:40.962 --> 00:28:42.054
Come on.

551
00:28:42.497 --> 00:28:45.660
Guys, this is Don Beaman,
the attorney for Mr. Ershon.


552
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:47.894
Roger Wesley,
head of his private security.


553
00:28:47.969 --> 00:28:49.903
- Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey!


554
00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:51.734
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

555
00:28:51.806 --> 00:28:53.774
- That's the guy who took our guns,
Captain. - And my shoes!


556
00:28:53.842 --> 00:28:56.902
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you
identify yourselves as police officers?


557
00:28:56.978 --> 00:28:58.070
What is this?

558
00:28:58.146 --> 00:29:00.478
- Allen, tell me. Did you?
- No, we did not.


559
00:29:00.582 --> 00:29:04.575
Sorry, gentlemen. We thought
you were abducting Mr. Ershon.


560
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.280
It's only protocol.

561
00:29:06.488 --> 00:29:10.605
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct
this scaffolding situation.


562
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.190
The case is closed.

563
00:29:11.192 --> 00:29:13.683
I've taken care
of all necessary paperwork.


564
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:15.888
And you fellas, at this point,
should just be glad that


565
00:29:15.997 --> 00:29:19.489
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges
for excessive use of force.


566
00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:21.034
- Thank you, Captain.
- You bet.


567
00:29:21.569 --> 00:29:23.161
Australian?

568
00:29:23.238 --> 00:29:24.671
Special Forces, right?

569
00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:27.564
Best watch your step, Detective.

570
00:29:27.675 --> 00:29:30.371
There are three things
I love in this world.


571
00:29:30.478 --> 00:29:31.536
Kylie Minogue,

572
00:29:33.148 --> 00:29:35.912
small dimples just above
a woman's buttocks...


573
00:29:36.017 --> 00:29:37.382
Beautiful features.

574
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:40.215
...and the fear in a man's eye
who knows I'm about to hurt him.


575
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:44.849
Hey! Shake your dicks.
This pissing contest is over.


576
00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:46.257
Come on, man.

577
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.924
All right, look,
they returned your shoes.


578
00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:56.599
And they returned your weapons.
Here you go, Terry.


579
00:29:58.206 --> 00:30:00.902
Allen, someone was nice enough
to put linseed oil on it,


580
00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:03.842
some kind of stain on that,
dark walnut or something.


581
00:30:03.912 --> 00:30:06.506
You might wanna think about
dropping them a thank you note.


582
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:07.707
Okay.

583
00:30:07.782 --> 00:30:08.908
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

584
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:12.714
First off, don't call me Gene.
I'm your captain.


585
00:30:12.787 --> 00:30:15.381
Guys, do you remember
the "Be Smart" speech?


586
00:30:15.456 --> 00:30:16.582
- Sure.
- All right.


587
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:19.285
Well, what did you do?
What'd you do about it?


588
00:30:19.394 --> 00:30:22.192
The opposite.
We were not smart, Captain Gene.


589
00:30:22.263 --> 00:30:24.231
It's just "Captain".

590
00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:25.730
Just "Captain".
It's not "Captain Gene".


591
00:30:25.735 --> 00:30:27.360
I don't have a kiddie show.

592
00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:29.062
That sounds creepy,
"Captain Gene".


593
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.531
<i>Police mistakenly arrest
investment banker, David Ershon.</i>


594
00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:36.543
<i>Was he the victim
of financial profiling?</i>


595
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:41.310
Financial profiling? That's crazy.
He broke the law and we arrested him.


596
00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:45.477
That wasn't a security team. He said,
"Don't let these people take me".


597
00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:47.987
I mean, when you hear hooves,
you think horses, not zebras.


598
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.087
What about donkeys or deer?

599
00:30:51.159 --> 00:30:53.127
They have hooves.
What about bovine creatures?


600
00:30:55.129 --> 00:30:57.256
Were you just thinking to yourself,
"Fresh start"?


601
00:30:57.332 --> 00:31:00.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I could see it.


602
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:02.460
Listen, why don't we just
go over to my place?


603
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.901
We'll talk the case down.

604
00:31:03.972 --> 00:31:05.997
We can have a little dinner.
You can meet Sheila.


605
00:31:06.107 --> 00:31:08.803
Two cops talking down a case
while eating food, all right?


606
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.070
- It's not dinner.
- Fine.


607
00:31:10.144 --> 00:31:11.941
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

608
00:31:12.013 --> 00:31:14.413
in case my wife acts
like a world-class bitch.


609
00:31:14.482 --> 00:31:19.681
She's a big old broad,
and she likes to wield it.


610
00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:22.605
Okay, so I put together
a little bio,


611
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.692
complete with pictures
of Mr. David Ershon.


612
00:31:25.793 --> 00:31:29.194
I used Adobe Premiere.
I like to do a little weekend editing.


613
00:31:29.297 --> 00:31:32.858
I recently just cut three minutes
out of Goodfellas.


614
00:31:32.967 --> 00:31:36.198
<i>David Ershon is currently
the CEO of Ershon Consortium.</i>


615
00:31:36.304 --> 00:31:37.362
Who's that talking?

616
00:31:37.472 --> 00:31:39.997
It's the Frontline Narration App.
It's only 99 cents.


617
00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:44.101
<i>Ershon Consortium, current financial
investments exceed $70 billion.</i>


618
00:31:44.178 --> 00:31:47.204
<i>His largest clients include
Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.</i>


619
00:31:47.315 --> 00:31:50.011
Lendl Global has those TV ads
where I can't figure out what they do.


620
00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:53.178
Yeah, oil, media, health care,
you've probably heard their jingle.


621
00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:56.223
Lendl Global,
we're in everything.


622
00:31:56.324 --> 00:31:59.157
<i>David Ershon is often found
in the company of Judge Scalia...</i>


623
00:31:59.227 --> 00:32:01.559
<i>- Yeah.
- ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.</i>


624
00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:03.494
I mean, this guy could be
connected to drug cartels,


625
00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:06.397
black market organ sales,
human trafficking, all of it.


626
00:32:06.501 --> 00:32:08.128
How do you get that
from anything I just said?


627
00:32:08.202 --> 00:32:09.999
Hey, guys! Soup's on.

628
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:11.470
What do you mean?

629
00:32:13.574 --> 00:32:14.666
Hi.

630
00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:16.334
- Hi.
- You must be Terry.


631
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:19.642
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey,
but this dinner was tricky.


632
00:32:21.015 --> 00:32:23.745
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.


633
00:32:24.052 --> 00:32:26.680
- Come on, seriously. Who is that?
- His old lady.


634
00:32:26.754 --> 00:32:29.245
- Sweetie, it's a workstation.
- Got it.


635
00:32:29.357 --> 00:32:32.884
And you come in here,
dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.


636
00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:34.928
I know you're working.
I'm so sorry.


637
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:37.020
- Come on, seriously.
- Come on, what?


638
00:32:37.098 --> 00:32:38.326
Who is that?

639
00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.424
That's the old...
That's the old ball and chain.


640
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.328
Get over here.

641
00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:46.032
- Not... Not right now.
- Okay.


642
00:32:46.107 --> 00:32:48.098
Look, they're not all
first-round picks, okay?


643
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:49.908
Come on, are you gonna tell me
who that is?


644
00:32:50.778 --> 00:32:54.270
- Are you really Allen's wife?
- I know.


645
00:32:54.382 --> 00:32:57.840
People are shocked because
he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,


646
00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.952
but somehow it works.

647
00:33:00.688 --> 00:33:03.248
- Are you gonna change?
- I already did.


648
00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:05.585
It's no big deal.
You look really, really nice.


649
00:33:05.693 --> 00:33:09.754
Terry, you don't have to be polite,
okay? She looks kind of shitty.


650
00:33:09.864 --> 00:33:11.195
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

651
00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:15.531
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo
Fashion App, you'd probably get a D-.


652
00:33:16.104 --> 00:33:17.901
Allen and his apps.
He loves them.


653
00:33:17.972 --> 00:33:19.585
You know he's designed
three of his own?


654
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.431
One of them...
Can I tell him?


655
00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:23.976
One of them, you can take
a picture of anybody's face,


656
00:33:24.078 --> 00:33:26.876
and it'll tell you
what the back of his head looks like.


657
00:33:27.115 --> 00:33:28.446
- Faceback.
- Faceback.


658
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:30.574
Got some horrible reviews
coming out of the gate.


659
00:33:30.952 --> 00:33:32.112
- It's gonna hit.
- It's gonna catch.


660
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.245
Why are you with Allen?

661
00:33:34.322 --> 00:33:38.224
I mean, that's not what I meant.
I meant, how did you guys meet?


662
00:33:38.292 --> 00:33:40.760
It's a really typical
"how we met" story, Terry.


663
00:33:41.329 --> 00:33:42.523
You're gonna be bored by it.

664
00:33:42.597 --> 00:33:43.675
I was a dancer
for the Knicks


665
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.591
while finishing my residency
at Columbia Hospital.


666
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:48.931
Allen came into the ER
with poison ivy on his rectum.


667
00:33:49.037 --> 00:33:50.095
Yes.

668
00:33:50.204 --> 00:33:52.832
Needless to say,
I fell for him immediately.


669
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:57.473
We immediately spent the next
three days at the La Quinta Inn,


670
00:33:58.212 --> 00:34:00.544
- and, to be honest, we didn't speak.
- Three days


671
00:34:00.615 --> 00:34:03.175
of not communicating once verbally.

672
00:34:03.484 --> 00:34:05.543
We had actually, without knowing it,

673
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.887
developed a language of eye flutters
and non-verbal gestures.


674
00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:13.787
You know, Terry,
it was just this primal connection.


675
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:17.855
After those three days
of non-verbal communication


676
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.223
and a whole lot of loving,

677
00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:22.766
I had to go to a specialist
to get my hips realigned.


678
00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:26.800
Similar to operating
on a German shepherd


679
00:34:27.542 --> 00:34:31.103
- when they have hip dysplasia.
- Very painful.


680
00:34:31.446 --> 00:34:33.795
It's funny, it's like a scene
from that one movie,


681
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.474
always forget the name of it.

682
00:34:35.583 --> 00:34:36.743
- With Meg Ryan.
- Yes.


683
00:34:36.818 --> 00:34:39.787
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.


684
00:34:39.887 --> 00:34:42.287
- I'll think of it.
I'll think of it. - Okay.


685
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:44.085
So, what about you, Terry?
Do you have a girl?


686
00:34:44.158 --> 00:34:46.149
I did, yeah.

687
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.728
We were supposed to get married,
but she backed out. It's complicated.


688
00:34:48.796 --> 00:34:51.264
- Terry shot Derek Jeter.
- Shut up, Allen. This was before.


689
00:34:51.332 --> 00:34:52.594
That's okay.

690
00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:54.635
She's Got Mail.
That's the name of the movie.


691
00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:56.669
That's it! Honey!

692
00:34:56.771 --> 00:34:57.829
- With Tom Hanks?
- Right.


693
00:34:57.939 --> 00:34:58.997
- And Meg Ryan.
- Meg Ryan.


694
00:34:59.107 --> 00:35:00.165
He didn't have poison ivy
up his ass.


695
00:35:00.274 --> 00:35:01.571
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, he did. Yeah.


696
00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:02.904
Way up there.

697
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:06.005
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough
for coming by. What a...


698
00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.741
What a wonderful, lovely evening.
Thank you.


699
00:35:07.815 --> 00:35:10.410
It was so, so nice
meeting you, Terry.


700
00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:11.445
It was my pleasure.
Thank you.


701
00:35:11.519 --> 00:35:16.013
And remember, all I ask of you is,
you don't let him get hurt, Terry.


702
00:35:16.124 --> 00:35:18.490
- She tells me that every day
before I leave. - Yep, I do.


703
00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:21.659
I come downstairs and I make him
his fresh-cut strawberries,


704
00:35:21.762 --> 00:35:24.526
and I say, "Listen, my little sugar
balls, whatever you do today,


705
00:35:24.632 --> 00:35:25.929
you just don't get hurt".

706
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.331
Yeah. Every morning.

707
00:35:27.768 --> 00:35:31.260
And then I show him my breasts,
and I say, "These are waiting for you


708
00:35:31.339 --> 00:35:32.465
- when you get back home".
- Right.


709
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.441
You know, Terry, they're not
the biggest breasts he's ever seen,


710
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.944
- but, man, are they perky.
- Not by a long shot.


711
00:35:38.012 --> 00:35:40.674
- And they are firm, and they are
yours. - You're a nice lady.


712
00:35:42.483 --> 00:35:43.677
Thank you for coming.

713
00:35:44.051 --> 00:35:48.010
<i>Detectives Hoitz and Gamble?
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.</i>


714
00:35:48.122 --> 00:35:49.180
Go for Hoitz.

715
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.814
<i>- We found your red Prius.
- Great.</i>


716
00:35:50.892 --> 00:35:52.985
<i>It was trying to vote
for Ralph Nader.</i>


717
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.290
- Come on.
- Okay, sugar balls, listen up.


718
00:35:55.363 --> 00:35:56.660
There's gonna be fingerprints
on that car.


719
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.063
Tomorrow, we're gonna run those
fingerprints through the system.


720
00:35:59.167 --> 00:36:02.830
And if we get a hit, this case is gonna
heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.


721
00:36:02.904 --> 00:36:05.236
You do one thing
when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.


722
00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:06.397
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sheila.


723
00:36:06.507 --> 00:36:07.565
He'll bring it.

724
00:36:07.675 --> 00:36:09.302
- Good night!
- Good night.


725
00:36:09.377 --> 00:36:10.708
Thank you, Sheila.

726
00:36:11.045 --> 00:36:14.071
- Bye, Terry! - Bye, Sheila!
I'll never forget tonight.


727
00:36:14.182 --> 00:36:15.979
- Bye, Terry! - All right, Allen,
whatever. Go inside.


728
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.142
Bye, Sheila!

729
00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:18.708
- Night!
- See you... See you, Terry!


730
00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:20.677
Bye, Sheila.

731
00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:27.253
I don't know
if he heard me. Bye, Terry!


732
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:28.919
Bye, Sheila!

733
00:36:32.366 --> 00:36:36.769
Well, here she is. They left her
under an overpass for the night.


734
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:38.532
You find anything?

735
00:36:38.606 --> 00:36:41.370
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

736
00:36:41.442 --> 00:36:43.410
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

737
00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:46.537
we determined that a bunch of old,
homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.


738
00:36:46.614 --> 00:36:48.878
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.


739
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.781
You know what that's called
when they do that in there?


740
00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:52.352
That's called a soup kitchen.

741
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.012
It's pretty rough stuff.

742
00:36:54.088 --> 00:36:57.580
Not long after that,
a mama raccoon came along


743
00:36:57.692 --> 00:36:59.091
and gave birth on the floor.

744
00:36:59.927 --> 00:37:01.519
Placenta blew out
all over the back window there.


745
00:37:02.663 --> 00:37:05.291
Yeah, and then to top it all off,
some joker comes along


746
00:37:05.566 --> 00:37:08.660
takes himself a nifty little dump
in the driver's seat.


747
00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:10.732
I think he knew you guys were cops,

748
00:37:11.138 --> 00:37:13.606
because this is what I would call
a spite shit.


749
00:37:14.075 --> 00:37:15.508
You were able to determine all of that

750
00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:17.407
- from the hair and fluid samples?
- Oh, yeah.


751
00:37:17.812 --> 00:37:19.677
What about fingerprints?
You find any fingerprints?


752
00:37:19.747 --> 00:37:21.772
- Nope, couldn't get a one.
- Found a cell phone.


753
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.444
Yeah, that's mine.

754
00:37:23.584 --> 00:37:25.017
Any signs of a struggle
or spent shells?


755
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.818
No. Believe me, everybody that was
in on this orgy was more than willing.


756
00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.983
In fact, they even left you
a note here.


757
00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:35.756
"Thanks for the F-shack.
Love, Dirty Mike and the boys."


758
00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:36.920
Here's something we found.

759
00:37:36.998 --> 00:37:39.592
We found about a dozen
unscratched lottery tickets.


760
00:37:39.767 --> 00:37:42.827
No fingerprints or nothing.
Check that out.


761
00:37:43.004 --> 00:37:44.300
Yeah, it's a real shame,
you know.


762
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:46.338
I got myself a Prius.
It's a hell of a machine.


763
00:37:47.174 --> 00:37:50.143
It's my first brand-new car.
I've never owned a new car.


764
00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:51.974
Found a deer vagina.

765
00:37:52.847 --> 00:37:55.042
- What?
- Thought it was human lips at first.


766
00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:57.617
Then we took a closer look.
It was definitely a deer vagina.


767
00:37:59.954 --> 00:38:00.818
Not even a free ticket.

768
00:38:02.056 --> 00:38:03.284
What are we gonna do?

769
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.451
We got no fingerprints,
a bunch of losing lottery tickets.


770
00:38:06.694 --> 00:38:09.162
Look at this, there's a two-minute
phone call made after we were jumped.


771
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.698
- They used your phone?
- They ghost dialed.


772
00:38:11.766 --> 00:38:12.926
Someone probably sat on it.

773
00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:15.764
It could have recorded some of their
conversation when Ershon got grabbed.


774
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.201
We gotta hear the other side
of that call.


775
00:38:18.372 --> 00:38:19.737
Nope, no, it's nothing.

776
00:38:19.807 --> 00:38:22.071
- Nothing? It's the only lead we have.
- It's nothing. It's nothing.


777
00:38:22.143 --> 00:38:23.542
Why did you just get super jumpy?

778
00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:25.737
What?

779
00:38:25.813 --> 00:38:27.781
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

780
00:38:27.882 --> 00:38:29.611
What's the matter?
What happened with you guys?


781
00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:31.548
She was just a bit of a handful,
that's it.


782
00:38:36.557 --> 00:38:38.491
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

783
00:38:38.592 --> 00:38:40.924
We either go with this or we walk away
from this case right now.


784
00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:43.395
Fine. Let's go see her.

785
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.572
Hello, Christinith.

786
00:38:57.645 --> 00:38:59.237
Hello, Allen.

787
00:39:01.649 --> 00:39:04.413
- That's my partner, Terry.
- Hi, Telly.


788
00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:08.015
- Holy shit. Dude.
- Just relax, relax.


789
00:39:08.789 --> 00:39:13.192
I waited for you in Tower Records
for four hours.


790
00:39:14.128 --> 00:39:16.096
That was 13 years ago.

791
00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:24.103
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer
alert. Who wants some Arnie Palmies?


792
00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:27.031
Sweetie, this one has the vodky,
right here.


793
00:39:27.141 --> 00:39:30.304
- Hal, just place it down, please.
- All righty.


794
00:39:31.145 --> 00:39:32.373
Okay.

795
00:39:36.517 --> 00:39:41.648
I did things in bed with you
that I haven't done with anyone since.


796
00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:43.019
No.

797
00:39:43.124 --> 00:39:44.705
Christinith, your husband...

798
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.389
- It's... It's awkward.
- Oh, no, he knows all of this.


799
00:39:46.393 --> 00:39:48.484
- You're a lucky dog.
- It's true.


800
00:39:51.532 --> 00:39:53.397
Christine, this is a lovely house.

801
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:56.527
It's Christinith.
Are you stupid, or are you deaf?


802
00:39:56.737 --> 00:39:59.331
Christinith, you idiot!

803
00:39:59.673 --> 00:40:04.042
You come to our house,
you get my wife's name right!


804
00:40:04.478 --> 00:40:05.843
- What?
- Christinith!


805
00:40:05.913 --> 00:40:08.677
Look, we really appreciate
the hospitality.


806
00:40:09.016 --> 00:40:11.177
We'd just love to get the message off
your cell phone.


807
00:40:11.252 --> 00:40:15.211
We believe it might give us information
regarding a kidnapping.


808
00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:16.412
Okay.

809
00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:21.096
Why don't you come to the kitchen,
and I will let you listen to it


810
00:40:21.098 --> 00:40:24.321
and everyone else
stay here.


811
00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:27.360
- Okay, sweetie.
- Come on.


812
00:40:31.238 --> 00:40:33.604
- There's my phone.
- Great, thank you for...


813
00:40:37.011 --> 00:40:40.447
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

814
00:40:40.514 --> 00:40:43.915
- You're so strong.
- I'm stronger than you will ever know!


815
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:47.010
I hate you! I hate you!

816
00:40:47.121 --> 00:40:50.613
You're so adorable.
Look at your face. Look at your face.


817
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:54.627
You go, "I wuv you".
Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith."


818
00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:04.871
You probably think because of the beard
that I'm really hairy.


819
00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:06.940
But I'm not.

820
00:41:08.342 --> 00:41:09.809
Shaved.

821
00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:12.040
- Allen!
- He's fine.


822
00:41:13.013 --> 00:41:14.207
Question.

823
00:41:15.249 --> 00:41:16.409
What would you rather be,

824
00:41:17.785 --> 00:41:20.253
a bear or a dog?

825
00:41:20.421 --> 00:41:23.356
- I don't care.
- I wanna be


826
00:41:24.725 --> 00:41:27.285
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

827
00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:30.328
'Cause that way,
I could live in the house


828
00:41:30.598 --> 00:41:33.567
but I still get to make a doodie
out in the woods.


829
00:41:34.368 --> 00:41:35.596
Allen!

830
00:41:39.874 --> 00:41:41.364
Allen! Allen!

831
00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:44.673
- This is police evidence. Terry!
Let's go! - Hey!


832
00:41:44.745 --> 00:41:47.270
You get back here
and you make love to my wife!


833
00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:48.905
Allen! Allen!

834
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.277
I don't get it, man.
I just do not get it.


835
00:41:53.387 --> 00:41:55.617
I mean, that girl Christinith
was seriously hot.


836
00:41:55.723 --> 00:41:57.350
Your wife is crazy hot.

837
00:41:57.424 --> 00:42:00.120
I mean, even that Brazilian security
chick, she threw you a "Do me" vibe.


838
00:42:00.694 --> 00:42:02.161
What is it with you and hot ladies?

839
00:42:02.229 --> 00:42:05.596
First off, my wife is cute,
but she's not hot.


840
00:42:05.699 --> 00:42:09.760
Dude, you're insane.
Your wife is scalding hot.


841
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.236
- You wanna listen to this message
or not? - Yeah, whatever.


842
00:42:12.339 --> 00:42:13.306
<i>You have one job, mate.</i>

843
00:42:14.008 --> 00:42:15.999
<i>Find a sucker to invest with you</i>

844
00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:18.044
<i>so you can pay my boss back
the money you lost.</i>


845
00:42:18.112 --> 00:42:19.340
<i>And I don't care who.</i>

846
00:42:19.413 --> 00:42:21.745
<i>Right. I actually think
I found a sucker...</i>


847
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:24.283
<i>- He's talking to Ershon.
- ...to invest $32 billion.</i>


848
00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:25.943
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

849
00:42:26.053 --> 00:42:28.283
<i>Once I get the money,
I'll falsify the records</i>


850
00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:31.186
<i>to show their massive losses
and then repay your employer.</i>


851
00:42:31.258 --> 00:42:34.921
<i>Now, since you're following me,
I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,</i>


852
00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:36.587
<i>and after that...</i>

853
00:42:36.697 --> 00:42:38.460
I told you it wasn't a security team.

854
00:42:38.766 --> 00:42:41.929
- He was being abducted.
- Obviously, but what kind... Holy...


855
00:42:42.036 --> 00:42:43.560
Nobody leaves our house
without making love to my wife!


856
00:42:43.637 --> 00:42:44.797
- Is that him?
- Yeah!


857
00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:46.702
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

858
00:42:46.774 --> 00:42:48.605
- Holy shit!
- They chased us 20 miles.


859
00:42:48.709 --> 00:42:50.904
- You come back here!
You get back here! - Allen!


860
00:42:58.652 --> 00:43:02.247
2300 Park Avenue.
It's the offices of the lottery.


861
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.085
Holy shit,
the lottery tickets we found.


862
00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:07.893
Ershon is using the lottery money
to cover his losses.


863
00:43:07.962 --> 00:43:10.795
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

864
00:43:10.898 --> 00:43:13.093
Well, what do we tell Mauch?
A guy lost some money.


865
00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:16.659
We have a scratchy cell phone message
and an address. It's still half a case.


866
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.530
There's gotta be
some sort of paper trail.


867
00:43:18.535 --> 00:43:20.730
If we can find that,
if we can track it,


868
00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:22.002
then we can go to Mauch.

869
00:43:22.776 --> 00:43:26.769
So, I did some more research
on Ershon's accounting firm,


870
00:43:26.847 --> 00:43:28.576
and I found some pretty interesting
stuff.


871
00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:31.812
It turns out
that Gretchel and Dawson has...


872
00:43:33.253 --> 00:43:34.948
Hold on, I'm up.

873
00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:39.316
<i>I gave my love to Erin</i>

874
00:43:40.294 --> 00:43:43.957
<i>She promised to be true</i>

875
00:43:44.498 --> 00:43:48.491
<i>I went to war to come back</i>

876
00:43:48.602 --> 00:43:52.538
<i>And find five British soldiers</i>

877
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.837
<i>Had their way with her</i>

878
00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:00.379
<i>It was consensual</i>

879
00:44:01.115 --> 00:44:02.173
Done?

880
00:44:02.282 --> 00:44:05.217
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey


881
00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:08.379
has only one client, David Ershon.

882
00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:11.014
Pretty rinky-dink operation
for a guy like that.


883
00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:13.821
Looks like we're going to Jersey
to visit an accounting firm.


884
00:44:13.894 --> 00:44:16.658
That's a shitty day.

885
00:44:17.898 --> 00:44:21.859
<i>And all their fathers
were hanged</i>


886
00:44:21.936 --> 00:44:25.494
<i>And the children
all got pink eye</i>


887
00:44:26.474 --> 00:44:36.212
<i>While their Harry Potter books
were burned</i>


888
00:44:40.054 --> 00:44:42.488
Do you have fun singing those songs?
They're really depressing.


889
00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:44.990
I do.
They're full of rich history.


890
00:44:46.193 --> 00:44:48.184
Damn it, I'm late.
I was supposed to go meet my lady.


891
00:44:48.262 --> 00:44:50.662
I thought you said you guys split up.

892
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:53.256
Let's just keep our thing
about work, okay?


893
00:44:53.367 --> 00:44:54.925
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

894
00:44:55.035 --> 00:44:57.026
Hey, get off me, man.

895
00:45:15.622 --> 00:45:18.352
What the hell are you doing?

896
00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:21.019
I'm dancing, Terry.
What the hell are you doing here?


897
00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:23.256
I love you, Francine.

898
00:45:23.363 --> 00:45:25.450
If you were with me, you wouldn't
be here in this strip club,


899
00:45:25.455 --> 00:45:26.595
shaking it for dollar bills!

900
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.728
This is a ballet studio, Terry.
Okay? These poles are horizontal.


901
00:45:31.805 --> 00:45:33.864
He loves you very much, Francine.

902
00:45:33.941 --> 00:45:36.409
- Who is this guy?
- What are you doing here, Allen?


903
00:45:36.477 --> 00:45:38.104
It's the code. 
I'm your partner.

904
00:45:38.312 --> 00:45:41.372
I'm here to support a friend
and a work colleague.


905
00:45:41.448 --> 00:45:42.938
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

906
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.917
Who's this, your new boyfriend?
Great. You got a new boyfriend.


907
00:45:45.986 --> 00:45:49.422
He is my dance partner, Terry.
Okay?


908
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.287
I know that this is a big surprise,

909
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:54.224
but there are other things in the world
besides being a cop. Okay?


910
00:45:54.895 --> 00:45:57.762
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm gonna dance.


911
00:45:57.831 --> 00:45:59.628
What, you don't think
I can do this shit?


912
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.345
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

913
00:46:18.652 --> 00:46:21.348
- I love you, Francine.
- You don't know what love is.


914
00:46:21.455 --> 00:46:23.389
He loves you very much, Francine!

915
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.390
I heard it when he said it.
Thank you.


916
00:46:25.492 --> 00:46:27.687
You know what you're doing to me?
You're killing me inside.


917
00:46:27.795 --> 00:46:28.887
And don't eyeball me, man!

918
00:46:28.996 --> 00:46:30.964
You're running around
with this crack-dealing drug addict?


919
00:46:31.031 --> 00:46:32.123
Terry!

920
00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:33.894
He does not approve of your behavior!

921
00:46:34.001 --> 00:46:35.969
Can you please go?

922
00:46:36.036 --> 00:46:38.334
And you, too,
creepy guy standing in the door?


923
00:46:42.476 --> 00:46:43.670
Let's go, Allen.

924
00:46:44.144 --> 00:46:46.704
I think we all experienced
our own ballet today.


925
00:46:47.047 --> 00:46:48.844
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

926
00:46:49.316 --> 00:46:50.874
You're kind of making things worse.

927
00:47:00.494 --> 00:47:03.327
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


928
00:47:04.765 --> 00:47:07.256
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

929
00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:10.670
We used to do those dance moves
to make fun of guys when we were kids,


930
00:47:10.737 --> 00:47:12.102
show them how queer they were, okay?

931
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:17.033
- You learned to dance like that
sarcastically? - Yeah, I guess.


932
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.671
Stay out of my personal life, okay?
The kid flies private.


933
00:47:20.747 --> 00:47:23.910
Stay focused on the case, man.
I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.


934
00:47:24.351 --> 00:47:25.909
All right, Terry.

935
00:47:26.453 --> 00:47:30.048
Hey, that was liberating for me.
I don't know how it felt for you.


936
00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:55.946
Here, check this out.
Article from six months ago.


937
00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:57.607
Talking about
how the lottery is looking


938
00:47:57.718 --> 00:48:00.118
to invest their $30-billion fund
more aggressively.


939
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:01.947
So he's dealing drugs?

940
00:48:02.322 --> 00:48:06.122
No, it's not drugs.
This isn't Miami Vice.


941
00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:11.060
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

942
00:48:11.765 --> 00:48:16.464
I am in a bit of a state today.
Sheila and I got into it last night.


943
00:48:17.004 --> 00:48:18.369
What happened?

944
00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:23.072
She was interested in taking this class
at The Learning Annex, right?


945
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.644
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

946
00:48:25.913 --> 00:48:28.609
You know, we just don't have it
in the budget right now.


947
00:48:29.216 --> 00:48:31.184
It's always about her.

948
00:48:31.585 --> 00:48:33.553
Yeah, that's... 
That's messed up.

949
00:48:35.289 --> 00:48:36.449
Hey, I got you a gift.

950
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.460
I just saw something,
and I thought of you,


951
00:48:39.465 --> 00:48:41.058
and so,
I don't want it to be weird.


952
00:48:41.128 --> 00:48:42.254
I just wanted to be nice.

953
00:48:42.362 --> 00:48:43.693
Of course it's weird.

954
00:48:43.764 --> 00:48:45.595
It's a grown man
giving another man a present.


955
00:48:47.267 --> 00:48:49.599
There you go. Open it up.

956
00:48:50.203 --> 00:48:52.103
It's okay, you're welcome.

957
00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:54.607
I like to do things like that.

958
00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:56.800
Take a look what it says.

959
00:49:05.652 --> 00:49:08.120
You know,
because we're both in law enforcement.


960
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:09.779
We both like women.

961
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.882
But I got a weird sense of humor.
I'm a sick puppy.


962
00:49:13.226 --> 00:49:15.387
I can't look at it.
It makes me laugh so hard.


963
00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:16.759
Me, too.

964
00:49:20.167 --> 00:49:23.330
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

965
00:49:25.572 --> 00:49:26.971
- Okay.
- Don't do that shit any more.


966
00:49:27.074 --> 00:49:28.439
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

967
00:49:29.076 --> 00:49:31.374
Do you understand
what's so funny about it, though?


968
00:49:32.946 --> 00:49:36.541
'Cause it's the FBI, right?
It has the same logo, the same shield.


969
00:49:36.616 --> 00:49:39.449
And at first glance, you're like,
it's just a mug that says "FBI".


970
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.684
But then at second glance,
you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?


971
00:49:44.758 --> 00:49:46.919
Get out of town. 
This is outrageous...

972
00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:48.289
Shut up!

973
00:50:00.807 --> 00:50:03.037
I'm gonna climb over
that anger wall of yours


974
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:04.202
one of these days,

975
00:50:04.277 --> 00:50:06.438
and it's gonna be glorious.

976
00:50:09.983 --> 00:50:12.645
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that
we're going to check this place out?


977
00:50:12.753 --> 00:50:14.021
For what?
We're just going to check it out.


978
00:50:14.025 --> 00:50:15.886
I know,
but it's procedure.


979
00:50:16.957 --> 00:50:19.084
Terry answers to no one.

980
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.921
I do what I do.

981
00:50:22.963 --> 00:50:25.431
What accounting firm is closed
at 11:00 a.m. on a Tuesday?


982
00:50:25.499 --> 00:50:26.761
This is a shithole.

983
00:50:34.441 --> 00:50:35.499
I love bombs.

984
00:50:35.609 --> 00:50:38.772
I can't hear! I can't hear!

985
00:50:40.247 --> 00:50:42.238
There's blood blisters
on my hands!


986
00:50:42.315 --> 00:50:43.407
Oh, my God!

987
00:50:43.483 --> 00:50:45.781
How do they walk away in movies
without flinching


988
00:50:45.852 --> 00:50:47.581
when it explodes behind them?

989
00:50:47.654 --> 00:50:50.919
There's no way!
I call bullshit on that!


990
00:50:51.258 --> 00:50:54.591
When they flew the Millennium Falcon
outside of the Death Star,


991
00:50:54.661 --> 00:50:58.654
and it was followed by the explosion,
that was bullshit!


992
00:50:58.765 --> 00:51:02.030
<i>Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars!
That was all accurate!</i>


993
00:51:02.135 --> 00:51:04.103
<i>I need an MRI.</i>

994
00:51:04.171 --> 00:51:08.471
<i>I need an MRI!
I've got soft tissue damage.</i>


995
00:51:08.942 --> 00:51:10.967
<i>There's no way
I don't have soft tissue damage.</i>


996
00:51:11.044 --> 00:51:12.136
<i>Please stop.</i>

997
00:51:12.212 --> 00:51:13.941
<i>I just wanna go somewhere
and breastfeed right now!</i>


998
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:22.487
Fire Department said it was a gas leak,
but no way. That was timed.


999
00:51:22.556 --> 00:51:24.353
They didn't wanna kill us,
but they wanted to scare us.


1000
00:51:24.458 --> 00:51:26.949
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

1001
00:51:27.027 --> 00:51:29.655
I'm tired of this. All right?

1002
00:51:29.729 --> 00:51:32.289
I'm tired of explosions
and people pointing guns at me.


1003
00:51:32.365 --> 00:51:34.492
I wanna go back to my desk.

1004
00:51:34.568 --> 00:51:38.060
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes
and messes with your ears.


1005
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:40.639
You can't escape it by hiding
at your desk for your whole life.


1006
00:51:40.707 --> 00:51:43.471
You know what? Yes, you can.
I've done it for years, okay?


1007
00:51:43.543 --> 00:51:46.478
There's no explosions at my desk.

1008
00:51:46.546 --> 00:51:51.483
There's no explosions at my home
with my plain wife, in my plain house.


1009
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.549
What are you afraid of, man?

1010
00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:01.184
I'm your partner. You can tell me.
What the hell are you hiding from?


1011
00:52:01.928 --> 00:52:04.294
I was a sophomore in college.

1012
00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:09.760
The university I went to
decided they needed to raise tuition.


1013
00:52:10.904 --> 00:52:12.990
A classmate of mine,
Brenda,


1014
00:52:13.395 --> 00:52:16.741
in an effort to raise money
and stay in school,


1015
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.778
came up with a nifty plan

1016
00:52:18.879 --> 00:52:21.313
where she thought she'd date guys
and charge them money.


1017
00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:23.073
I go on dates all the time,

1018
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.277
with a whole bunch of,
you know, boys and stuff.


1019
00:52:25.385 --> 00:52:27.505
And I kind of need somebody
to help me out,


1020
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:29.219
like, you know,
my partner in crime.


1021
00:52:29.289 --> 00:52:31.553
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

1022
00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:33.217
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.


1023
00:52:33.293 --> 00:52:35.818
- Provide transportation services.
- Yeah, yeah.


1024
00:52:35.929 --> 00:52:38.056
- It's gonna be a good time.
- Thanks so much for asking me.


1025
00:52:38.131 --> 00:52:40.599
<i>She said she needed my help to make
sure that the dates went okay</i>


1026
00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:44.125
and that the guys paid her.
She said she'd give me a percentage.


1027
00:52:44.237 --> 00:52:47.502
- Oh, my God. You were a pimp.
- What? God, no.


1028
00:52:47.607 --> 00:52:49.666
No, I was just
trying to help a friend.

1029
00:52:49.776 --> 00:52:52.336
<i>We started making
a lot of money.</i>


1030
00:52:53.346 --> 00:52:56.247
<i>And wouldn't you know it,
some of Brenda's girlfriends</i>


1031
00:52:56.316 --> 00:52:59.012
<i>decided they wanted to
be a part of it.</i>

1032
00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:01.781
<i>Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies
that I was protecting</i>


1033
00:53:01.855 --> 00:53:03.482
<i>while they gave me money.</i>

1034
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.114
<i>That's called a stable of whores.</i>

1035
00:53:06.026 --> 00:53:08.960
We decided
I shouldn't use my real name.


1036
00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:10.964
So we came up
with the name "Gator".


1037
00:53:11.198 --> 00:53:12.665
I'm telling you,
you were a pimp.


1038
00:53:12.766 --> 00:53:15.360
No! Are you even listening
to the story?


1039
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:20.264
Anyway, one day,
I wake up and I look in the mirror,


1040
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.604
and I don't like what I see.

1041
00:53:23.843 --> 00:53:27.370
<i>I mean, I had gotten out of control,
and I didn't even realize it.</i>


1042
00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:30.513
You can't have a conscience
in the pimp game.


1043
00:53:31.284 --> 00:53:33.013
One night,
two of my favorite girls,


1044
00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:35.314
Candy and Jolene, said,
"We gotta take you in",


1045
00:53:35.388 --> 00:53:37.686
and they dropped me off
at the emergency room.


1046
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:39.691
That's where I met Sheila.
I was a mess.


1047
00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:42.195
I made a promise
to myself and to her


1048
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.993
that I would never
get out of control again.


1049
00:53:45.832 --> 00:53:47.197
So, as soon as I graduated
from college,


1050
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.201
I became an accountant
for the police department.


1051
00:53:50.837 --> 00:53:53.533
The most stable job I could think of.

1052
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:57.541
An accountant for law and order.

1053
00:53:59.846 --> 00:54:03.907
I just don't wanna ever feel
out of control like that ever again.


1054
00:54:04.017 --> 00:54:06.713
Don't worry. I got your back.

1055
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.220
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill
and see if he cracks.


1056
00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:13.088
- I'm tired of all this
tippy-toeing around. - Okay.


1057
00:54:13.426 --> 00:54:16.156
<i>You can either walk the plank
or take your panties off.</i>


1058
00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:17.856
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

1059
00:54:17.931 --> 00:54:22.197
<i>- I want to take my panties off.
- You've made a wise choice, you have.</i>


1060
00:54:22.269 --> 00:54:24.940
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble
and the officer


1061
00:54:24.945 --> 00:54:27.071
who shot Derek Jeter
are here.


1062
00:54:27.607 --> 00:54:28.869
Gentlemen, please.

1063
00:54:28.942 --> 00:54:32.241
- Remember us, hotshot?
- Of course I do. Please, sit.


1064
00:54:32.345 --> 00:54:34.006
<i>There she blows.</i>

1065
00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:39.681
Two of those Russian waters, please.
No lime wedges, just cucumber.


1066
00:54:39.753 --> 00:54:42.881
Guess where we just came from?
An explosion at your accounting office.


1067
00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:45.453
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1068
00:54:45.558 --> 00:54:49.460
Gas leak? The only gas leak is the one
coming out of your mouth right now.


1069
00:54:49.562 --> 00:54:54.590
I just thank God no one was hurt
or injured in a bad way.


1070
00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:57.397
I absolutely abhor death.

1071
00:54:57.637 --> 00:55:01.095
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber.
The jig is up, okay?


1072
00:55:01.241 --> 00:55:03.072
We know that wasn't your security team
that grabbed you.


1073
00:55:03.143 --> 00:55:05.475
And we know you're targeting
a big fish to cover losses.


1074
00:55:05.578 --> 00:55:07.910
You talk or I beat you
so it don't show no bruises.


1075
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:11.045
God, this water is good.
Terry, have you tried the water?
