I MET LOH KIWAN BY CHO HAE-JIN


2
00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:05.353
When we land, walk out separately.
Don't crowd together.


3
00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.936
Once in customs, you'll see a checkpoint.
That's where you'll give your passport.


4
00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:14.520
Try not to act nervous.
Do what they tell you.


5
00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:18.103
But, sir, what if
they question all of us?

6
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:22.561
"I don't speak French, sorry."
That's all you'll have to say.


7
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.561
We're preparing to land.
For your safety, sit down, please.


8
00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:29.020
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:32.520
Once you're off the plane, go to gate 3.
We'll meet by the bathrooms.


10
00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:36.145
"I don't speak French."

11
00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:39.770
-Wait, so what do I do, then?
-I don't speak French.


12
00:02:39.853 --> 00:02:42.603
Memorize it.
You could get caught otherwise.


13
00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.228
-What do we do if we get caught?
<i>-This is your captain speaking.</i>


14
00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:49.311
<i>We have begun our descent</i>
<i>into Brussels Airport.</i>


15
00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:54.645
Next.

16
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.145
"I don't…"

17
00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:16.520
Please have
your passports ready. Thank you.


18
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.686
Jeon Chun-bong.

19
00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:40.436
Lee Han-gil.

20
00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:42.686
Park Dong-hun.

21
00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:44.895
Kim Jeong-sik.

22
00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:47.186
Lee Gwang-cheol.

23
00:03:55.978 --> 00:03:59.228
Um, excuse me, comrade.
Where is this place?


24
00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:02.228
I'll drive you. Forty bucks.

25
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:06.145
I'll pay you when we get there.

26
00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:50.228
Here's the money.

27
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:58.145
I don't know what your story is,
but I don't want any bad luck. Take it.


28
00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:17.603
Call me if you
wanna go back to China.

29
00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:18.645
Here's my card.

30
00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:23.686
Go.

31
00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:31.228
Please
don't push each other around.


32
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.436
Please stay in the line.

33
00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.603
You can't stand there.
Go to the other side.


34
00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:42.728
Come on through.

35
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:54.686
Next.

36
00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:57.103
Move on, please.
Move on.


37
00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:03.645
Please fill out this form.

38
00:06:15.978 --> 00:06:16.895
Next.

39
00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:27.686
You must attach a copy of your ID.

40
00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:29.853
An ID.

41
00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:32.020
Um, passport, please.

42
00:06:34.103 --> 00:06:38.270
A copy of the passport
or another form of ID you have to attach.


43
00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:40.061
Do you… Okay.

44
00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:44.936
Please get some help
from the interpreter, okay?


45
00:06:45.686 --> 00:06:46.895
Mm-hmm.

46
00:06:46.978 --> 00:06:48.145
Yes. Mm-hmm.

47
00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:49.228
You. Help.

48
00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:57.770
Mr. Loh Kiwan?

49
00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.811
Hello there.
I'm your interpreter, Kim Gyeong-sil.


50
00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:03.728
Oh.

51
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.186
You're in luck today.
You usually have to book in advance.


52
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.603
I'm really glad to help you out.
Shall we go?


53
00:07:19.353 --> 00:07:21.728
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello.


54
00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:31.228
"First thing we need to do
is gather some personal information."


55
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:35.145
"Your name, your date of birth,
country of origin, and hometown."


56
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.603
My name is Loh Kiwan.

57
00:07:43.728 --> 00:07:46.686
I was born
December 1st, um, 1990.


58
00:07:48.061 --> 00:07:52.728
Camp 7, Hasang Collective Farm, Usi-gun,
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


59
00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:56.103
I was born
in the farm's seventh work unit.


60
00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:02.186
I was able to obtain a passport
through a broker my uncle found.


61
00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:15.228
"So, Mr. Loh,
you say that you fled to China in 2019


62
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.103
but that you weren't employed
while you were living in Yanji."


63
00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:22.020
"How were you able
to afford a plane ticket here to Belgium


64
00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:23.686
and counterfeit a passport?"

65
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.103
Well, uh…

66
00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:28.395
Well, my mother… she…

67
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:36.436
" Do you mean
your mother gave you the money?"


68
00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:56.936
Mom, why aren't you eating?

69
00:08:57.853 --> 00:08:58.853
I'm not hungry.

70
00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:02.353
Anyway, it brings good luck
when you eat a birthday meal alone.


71
00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:03.436
They say if you do that,

72
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.436
you'll go through your entire life
without ever starving.


73
00:09:08.853 --> 00:09:12.520
They say you should eat your noodles whole
if you want to live longer,


74
00:09:12.603 --> 00:09:14.520
so stop breaking your noodles apart, okay?

75
00:09:14.603 --> 00:09:15.936
All right, okay.

76
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.603
Oh, Mom… do you work today?

77
00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:38.311
You know people like to have
warm food on cold days.


78
00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:40.978
That also means more
money for you and me.

79
00:09:42.936 --> 00:09:45.145
I know, but I
should be the one working.

80
00:09:45.228 --> 00:09:48.728
You do so much for us…
while I spend my days indoors.


81
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:49.936
It's so unfair.

82
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.520
Now, now. It's your birthday,
and I don't mind working.


83
00:09:52.603 --> 00:09:55.311
Besides, all a mother wants is
for her child to be safe and healthy.


84
00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:58.603
I can continue to work for us
until we leave China.


85
00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:00.645
So don't worry.

86
00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:08.686
It's my fault.

87
00:10:11.103 --> 00:10:14.145
I should've turned a blind eye
when the boss was beating up Jeong-jin.


88
00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:18.061
Otherwise, I wouldn't have to be
in hiding like this.


89
00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:20.936
-I'm sorry, Mother.
-Now, don't talk like that.


90
00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:23.978
He would have died
if you didn't intervene.


91
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.061
You did the right thing,
so never apologize for that.


92
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:29.645
All right, okay.

93
00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.811
Don't stay past closing, hmm?

94
00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:36.103
I would leave on time
if it was up to me, but it's not.


95
00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:41.270
I'll see you after work.

96
00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:45.353
Happy birthday, comrade.

97
00:11:04.811 --> 00:11:06.228
Miss!

98
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:07.186
Yes?

99
00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:13.020
-What would you like?
-A cold one.


100
00:11:13.103 --> 00:11:14.186
Coming right up.

101
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.436
-Hey, that snow sure is wild.
-Hey, comrade!


102
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.686
-You're here!
-Yeah!


103
00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:59.853
Mr. Loh?
This is the last question for today.


104
00:12:02.603 --> 00:12:04.436
"Are you Korean
-Chinese

105
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.936
and just pretending
that you are North Korean


106
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.020
to receive state subsidies
set aside for defectors?"


107
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:11.811
Uh,

108
00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:13.770
I am not.

109
00:12:13.853 --> 00:12:14.811
No.

110
00:12:17.728 --> 00:12:22.270
There will be a second interview.
I can fit you in on February 5th.


111
00:12:24.228 --> 00:12:26.436
At three o'clock. 
I'll jot you down.

112
00:12:27.103 --> 00:12:28.436
I guess I'll see you then.

113
00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:30.103
Um, wait…

114
00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:34.603
You mean February… of next year?
Is that what I'm hearing?


115
00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:35.603
Mmm.

116
00:12:36.978 --> 00:12:41.020
It's just… what am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to work for now?


117
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.228
You'll just have to hang in there.

118
00:13:34.103 --> 00:13:36.103
Where did you say
that restaurant was again?


119
00:13:36.603 --> 00:13:39.311
Oh, just have to go downstairs.
It's on the left.


120
00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:40.311
Ah!

121
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.936
Oh God, baby,
you taste like watermelon.


122
00:15:06.811 --> 00:15:09.061
Come up here.
I wanna taste too.


123
00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:11.270
You will. I'm not done with you yet.

124
00:15:11.353 --> 00:15:13.686
Yeah, right there.

125
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.228
Oh yes. You're so good like that.

126
00:15:23.228 --> 00:15:24.228
Oh yeah.

127
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.561
Oh, hey there, sexy. 
You wanna join us?

128
00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:32.770
Hey, get out of here!
I said, get out of here, huh?


129
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.270
Get out of here!

130
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.103
Don't kick him out so soon!

131
00:15:41.186 --> 00:15:42.270
I wanna taste of him.

132
00:15:44.353 --> 00:15:45.895
Hey! Let me in!

133
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:48.520
You idiot! I kicked you out, freak!

134
00:15:51.686 --> 00:15:53.436
Now, where were we?

135
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.311
You missed out.
Maybe next time, pretty boy.


136
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.145
Who's this piece of trash?

137
00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:23.561
Isn't this the one we saw
pissing by the train station?


138
00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:25.686
This one's way shorter.
Makes you look tall.


139
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.936
Shut up, asshole.

140
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.936
Get lost, you beggar.
This is our fire.


141
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.520
-Yeah, get out of here.
-I won't hurt you.


142
00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:33.770
Take your shit
and get the hell out of here!


143
00:21:35.353 --> 00:21:36.728
Sorry, I lied.

144
00:21:36.811 --> 00:21:38.353
Take that, you beggar.

145
00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:40.103
Dirty bastard!

146
00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:42.853
Take that, bitch!

147
00:21:43.561 --> 00:21:45.770
That's what you get, you dirty hobo!

148
00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:53.603
-Damn, I'm starving.
-Down for a beer?


149
00:21:53.686 --> 00:21:54.978
I never turn down beer.

150
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.436
-I can go for a burger.
-You eat too much.


151
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.811
Hey, hurry up!

152
00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:32.270
I'll ask you one more time.

153
00:23:32.353 --> 00:23:33.395
NAME: LOH KIWAN

154
00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:35.311
Is this person here your son?

155
00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:38.186
No, sir.

156
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:40.311
That's not my son.

157
00:23:42.353 --> 00:23:44.478
Hey there! Officer Lee.

158
00:23:46.228 --> 00:23:49.186
Don't you two know
this lady is Mr. Choi's second cousin?


159
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.520
Mr. Choi?

160
00:23:51.103 --> 00:23:52.895
Oh, come now. You remember.

161
00:23:53.603 --> 00:23:56.770
He gave your wife a ride
that night she got too drunk.


162
00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.436
Ah, guess what.

163
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.061
Mr. Choi's son recently was accepted
to Peking University.


164
00:24:03.145 --> 00:24:06.520
Mr. Choi was never one for studying.
It's funny, actually.


165
00:24:06.603 --> 00:24:07.895
He barely graduated.

166
00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:10.436
How did a fool like that
raise such a smart son?


167
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.895
Huh?

168
00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:17.728
Hey, Ma.

169
00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:29.270
Hey!

170
00:24:33.145 --> 00:24:34.478
Hey, freeze!

171
00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:36.686
Mom, this way!

172
00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:38.770
Stop!

173
00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:43.770
Stop! There they are!
Stop right there! Freeze!


174
00:24:43.853 --> 00:24:45.395
-Shit!
-Hey!


175
00:24:46.145 --> 00:24:47.311
It's through here.

176
00:24:47.395 --> 00:24:48.603
Come on! Get them!

177
00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:01.978
They went that way!

178
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:03.436
Freeze right now!

179
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.686
Mom, no. Over here.

180
00:25:08.395 --> 00:25:09.395
This way!

181
00:25:14.978 --> 00:25:16.145
Almost there, Mom!

182
00:25:52.811 --> 00:25:53.811
Mom!

183
00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:58.395
Answer me. Mom!

184
00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:05.395
Wake up! Mom!

185
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:08.936
-She just came out from nowhere.
-Yeah, crazy.


186
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.020
-Ok Hui, wake up.
-Uncle, help me. Please!


187
00:26:20.103 --> 00:26:22.145
-Hey! Hey. Hey, sis.
-Mom, wake up!


188
00:26:22.228 --> 00:26:24.311
-Mom!
-Open your eyes. Please!


189
00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:27.270
Hey! Move the car! Hey!

190
00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:31.436
Kiwan.

191
00:26:35.395 --> 00:26:36.978
You have to survive, Kiwan.

192
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.853
You'll have to continue on without me now.

193
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.395
You need to go on.

194
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.228
Find a life worth living.

195
00:26:49.686 --> 00:26:50.936
Seek refuge…

196
00:26:52.936 --> 00:26:54.353
and have a life of your own.

197
00:26:57.103 --> 00:26:58.395
Get up, Ma.

198
00:26:58.478 --> 00:27:01.061
You're coming with me too.
You'll be okay, huh?


199
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.311
You can't be here. 
They'll catch you.

200
00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:07.603
I'll stay here with your mother.
Don't get caught.


201
00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:09.936
Someone help us!

202
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.686
We'll all die if you get caught!
Get out of here!


203
00:27:13.853 --> 00:27:14.853
Go, son.

204
00:27:16.353 --> 00:27:17.436
Go!

205
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.270
-Go!
-Hey, there here! I found them.


206
00:27:21.353 --> 00:27:22.728
Over here!

207
00:27:22.811 --> 00:27:25.603
-This way!
-Kiwan, you can't get caught!


208
00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:27.895
-Please, just go!
-Coming through!


209
00:27:30.103 --> 00:27:32.436
-You have to leave.
-Move, people.


210
00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:34.103
Hurry, Kiwan.

211
00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:35.561
Move out of the way!

212
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.395
He doesn't speak English or French.

213
00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:38.103
Can we get an interpreter?

214
00:28:39.186 --> 00:28:40.020
Okay.

215
00:28:42.603 --> 00:28:45.311
I'm calling
from Schaerbeek Police Station.


216
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.853
You posted bail for Ms. 
Marie Lee, right?

217
00:28:52.853 --> 00:28:54.478
She is suspected of theft.

218
00:28:55.603 --> 00:28:56.436
Hold on.

219
00:28:57.686 --> 00:28:58.520
Ma'am.

220
00:29:01.228 --> 00:29:02.603
You don't need to come.

221
00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:04.478
Just send the settlement money.

222
00:29:08.186 --> 00:29:12.145
Listen to me. How many times
do I have to tell you don't come here?


223
00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:25.145
Excuse me. Hello, comrade.

224
00:29:26.603 --> 00:29:29.686
My wallet. Can you please give it back?

225
00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:33.145
What wallet?

226
00:29:34.811 --> 00:29:35.686
I have no idea.

227
00:29:40.978 --> 00:29:45.395
Listen, comrade. 
I know, uh… you took it.

228
00:29:46.936 --> 00:29:48.770
So please give it back to me, huh?

229
00:29:49.978 --> 00:29:51.561
Did you spend everything in it?

230
00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:53.478
Did you?

231
00:29:54.061 --> 00:29:55.270
I did. Why?

232
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.145
What else
was I supposed to do with it, hmm?


233
00:30:08.353 --> 00:30:09.436
Well, that wallet…

234
00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:13.478
My mother, uh…

235
00:30:15.228 --> 00:30:16.978
The wallet is all
I have left of her.

236
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.436
The money that you stole from me,

237
00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:25.228
I obtained it…

238
00:30:27.353 --> 00:30:29.103
from selling my mother's body.

239
00:30:30.436 --> 00:30:32.353
So please tell me where my wallet is.

240
00:30:35.728 --> 00:30:38.520
This is a plane ticket
to fly to Belgium tomorrow.


241
00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:41.936
This money,

242
00:30:43.478 --> 00:30:45.145
where did you get it?

243
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.853
Huh?

244
00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:56.270
Your mother's body was, um…

245
00:30:57.811 --> 00:30:59.061
was sold to a hospital.

246
00:31:07.103 --> 00:31:08.853
My mother was sold?

247
00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.186
What are you talking about, Uncle?

248
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.936
Uncle?

249
00:31:18.436 --> 00:31:21.228
Listen, your mother wanted this.

250
00:31:21.978 --> 00:31:24.728
I showed her the money
so she knew how much her life was worth.


251
00:31:25.228 --> 00:31:26.436
She agreed to this.

252
00:31:28.603 --> 00:31:31.645
It was… her final gift.

253
00:31:53.228 --> 00:31:55.103
-Let go of me, Uncle.
-Kiwan, don't.


254
00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:57.103
Stop! Let go!

255
00:31:58.853 --> 00:32:00.811
Let go! Let me die!

256
00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:03.270
Leave me alone!

257
00:32:03.353 --> 00:32:05.061
Give it here! Let me die!

258
00:32:05.853 --> 00:32:07.145
Uncle, let go of me.

259
00:32:08.895 --> 00:32:10.061
Stop.

260
00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:12.395
What are you doing?

261
00:32:13.478 --> 00:32:14.770
Get a grip, Kiwan.

262
00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:17.228
Your mother wanted you to survive!

263
00:32:18.853 --> 00:32:20.353
You can't die, you hear?

264
00:32:21.145 --> 00:32:23.145
Do it for your mother's sake, okay?

265
00:32:23.978 --> 00:32:24.978
Do you hear me?

266
00:32:27.978 --> 00:32:31.228
Don't let
your… mother's death be in vain.


267
00:32:31.728 --> 00:32:33.395
You need to get out of here.

268
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.020
Get on that plane and never look back!

269
00:32:37.936 --> 00:32:39.520
Promise me you will!

270
00:32:41.936 --> 00:32:43.895
Promise me!

271
00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:46.770
I need to know
that you'll be okay, Kiwan.

272
00:32:47.353 --> 00:32:48.895
Tell me you understand!

273
00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:53.978
Kiwan.

274
00:32:54.936 --> 00:32:56.478
Kiwan.

275
00:34:33.395 --> 00:34:34.520
I'm sorry.

276
00:34:40.186 --> 00:34:41.561
Mom, I'm sorry.

277
00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:51.436
Mom! Mom!

278
00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:19.020
You want your wallet?

279
00:35:22.436 --> 00:35:23.520
I need your help.

280
00:35:25.186 --> 00:35:29.270
Tell them that I stole… only 30 bucks,
and you can have your wallet back.


281
00:35:31.895 --> 00:35:33.770
You really are shameless, aren't you?

282
00:35:34.978 --> 00:35:37.895
You want me to lie for you
after what you did?


283
00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:39.103
I've got a record.

284
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.353
I won't get locked
up for just 30 bucks.

285
00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:45.395
A thief should go to jail.
It's exactly where you belong.


286
00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:50.270
I can't get your
wallet if I'm locked up.

287
00:35:53.561 --> 00:35:54.603
Just help me.

288
00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:59.311
I'm hoping
you can help confirm his identity


289
00:35:59.395 --> 00:36:01.020
and the exact amount stolen.

290
00:36:02.145 --> 00:36:03.145
Okay.

291
00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:05.270
All right.

292
00:36:05.811 --> 00:36:07.770
Just a moment. 
I'll put him on.

293
00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:16.436
Good afternoon to you too.

294
00:36:17.978 --> 00:36:19.978
Loh Kiwan is my name, yes.

295
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:21.645
Yes.

296
00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:26.061
It was American dollars.

297
00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:32.728
About $30. Thank you.

298
00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:36.770
Yes.

299
00:36:37.853 --> 00:36:39.145
Thank you.

300
00:36:41.228 --> 00:36:42.686
We'll make it quick.

301
00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:44.770
Let's go.

302
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:47.936
Just go home and wait.
I'll get it for you later.


303
00:36:49.103 --> 00:36:51.436
I don't have a home to go to.
So let's go now.


304
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.061
Well, give me your number,
and I'll grab it for you tomorrow.


305
00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:57.103
You think I'd trust a thief?
I want my wallet back.


306
00:36:57.686 --> 00:36:58.728
We'll go together.

307
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.228
Marie. Marie!

308
00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:13.853
Uh, sir, wait a minute.
Sorry, I'm Marie's father. Can we speak?


309
00:37:15.645 --> 00:37:17.311
I heard you're from North Korea.

310
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.686
This is for you.
It's not much, I'm afraid.


311
00:37:21.311 --> 00:37:23.311
-It's just-- Don't make a scene.
-What are you doing?


312
00:37:24.686 --> 00:37:26.353
I'm just trying to help you here.

313
00:37:28.853 --> 00:37:30.103
It's only a small amount, but…

314
00:37:30.186 --> 00:37:31.395
-Stop!
-Stop, Marie.


315
00:37:37.478 --> 00:37:40.353
-Stop acting like you're a good person!
-Can't we talk for a moment?


316
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.103
I've got nothing to say to you.

317
00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:46.728
Seriously.

318
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.186
Are you coming or not?

319
00:38:09.686 --> 00:38:11.103
Hey, just wait here.

320
00:38:12.145 --> 00:38:14.686
Oh, that's a good one.
You know I don't trust you.


321
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.311
-I'm coming too.
-Stay here! Do as I say.


322
00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:22.186
Give me ten minutes.

323
00:38:29.728 --> 00:38:31.353
Please give me a bit more time.

324
00:38:32.395 --> 00:38:34.228
Goddamn it!

325
00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:35.686
I told you not to move.

326
00:38:37.186 --> 00:38:38.811
Don't knock over the apple.

327
00:38:41.478 --> 00:38:44.020
Oh, Marie, you're here.
Hey, riddle me this.


328
00:38:44.103 --> 00:38:46.603
How do I avoid shooting
the journalist in the head?


329
00:38:46.686 --> 00:38:49.561
Please just give me more time.

330
00:38:49.645 --> 00:38:53.186
Is there a problem with my stance?
What do you think?


331
00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:55.270
You aim too long.

332
00:38:57.228 --> 00:39:00.061
Shoot within three seconds of aiming.
Don't hesitate.


333
00:39:00.145 --> 00:39:02.353
Is that right?

334
00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:13.311
This isn't my specialty.

335
00:39:14.353 --> 00:39:15.978
I only set the targets.

336
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:17.770
But you shoot them.

337
00:39:27.103 --> 00:39:30.145
Remember the wallet I gave you yesterday?
Well, I need it back.


338
00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:32.478
Marie, you're terribly predictable.

339
00:39:34.728 --> 00:39:35.770
It's almost cute.

340
00:39:46.686 --> 00:39:48.061
-Don't touch me!
-Shut up!


341
00:39:51.061 --> 00:39:52.686
Give us a moment.

342
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.645
I expected this.

343
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.145
You stole it, didn't you?

344
00:40:01.228 --> 00:40:02.978
It's none of your business.

345
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:08.436
Don't steal money to pay me back.

346
00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:11.978
Work for me until your debt is paid.

347
00:40:12.686 --> 00:40:14.103
I told you I quit.

348
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:17.436
I think that's my decision.

349
00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:24.978
Next Wednesday, two-on-two with the Dutch.
Win and I'll give you this money back.


350
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.478
And the wallet.

351
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.436
Tell them I shoot from 25 meters.

352
00:40:36.603 --> 00:40:39.186
They're gonna ask for 50,
but say no, okay?


353
00:40:39.936 --> 00:40:40.895
Okay.

354
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.520
Let's get outta here.

355
00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:54.436
Hey, wait. Where's my wallet?

356
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.936
I'll get it next week.
You have to wait longer.


357
00:40:58.353 --> 00:41:01.770
Is this all a big joke?
You're lying to me again, aren't you?


358
00:41:01.853 --> 00:41:03.353
I'm not lying, all right?

359
00:41:03.436 --> 00:41:05.686
Your wallet's with a friend.

360
00:41:08.728 --> 00:41:09.645
Shit.

361
00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:11.186
Hey!

362
00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:17.936
Last round.
We've gotta get to work soon.


363
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.520
All right, next round.

364
00:41:22.645 --> 00:41:25.103
You know those guys.
They're all about money.


365
00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:27.228
Like you, right?

366
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:28.436
Ah, shut up.

367
00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:31.853
-What the hell?
-What's his deal?


368
00:41:32.395 --> 00:41:33.395
I want my wallet.

369
00:41:34.436 --> 00:41:36.353
-Give me my wallet!
-Fuck off.


370
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:40.436
-Hey, get up. Come on, let's go.
-Aren't they just two of a kind?


371
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.145
What's going on?
What's with all the noise?


372
00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.270
Why are you still here?

373
00:41:48.395 --> 00:41:49.770
Oh, I see.

374
00:41:50.395 --> 00:41:54.395
So you're the "friend" she mentioned, huh?

375
00:41:55.561 --> 00:41:56.603
Stay right there.

376
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.186
You and I need to talk.

377
00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:02.728
Let me go! Let go! Stop it!

378
00:42:09.145 --> 00:42:10.478
-Shit!
-Kiwan.


379
00:42:11.186 --> 00:42:14.186
If we don't leave, they'll kill you.
This won't solve anything.


380
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.520
Let go of me!

381
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.145
You can trust me. I promise.

382
00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:21.686
I'll get your wallet. 
I swear I'll get it.

383
00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:01.270
Come over here.

384
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.395
You have to remember
that you're in a foreign country,


385
00:43:10.478 --> 00:43:13.520
so you better keep that temper of yours
in check. Got it?


386
00:43:14.645 --> 00:43:16.270
Yeah, well, you're one to talk.

387
00:43:33.686 --> 00:43:35.270
When did you come to Belgium?

388
00:43:39.478 --> 00:43:40.645
When I was young.

389
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:45.103
When did she pass away?

390
00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:48.186
Your ma.

391
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.936
The 2nd of last December.

392
00:43:52.686 --> 00:43:54.145
2:15 in the morning.

393
00:43:56.478 --> 00:43:58.603
So you must feel
lonely this time of year.

394
00:44:01.603 --> 00:44:03.436
My mom also died in the winter.

395
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.020
Have you found any work here?

396
00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:15.853
I recycle bottles for money.

397
00:44:15.936 --> 00:44:17.603
I make just enough not to die.

398
00:44:20.936 --> 00:44:23.770
I know it's not too fancy,
but at least I don't steal.


399
00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:24.978
Okay, trash king.

400
00:44:25.895 --> 00:44:29.145
No one's going to give me any work.
I don't exist here.


401
00:44:40.395 --> 00:44:42.645
ILSIM EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

402
00:44:43.853 --> 00:44:45.895
Hey. Call here.

403
00:44:46.895 --> 00:44:49.978
The boss there is a Korean guy.
Say Lee Youn-sung sent you.


404
00:44:50.061 --> 00:44:51.311
Lee Youn-sung?

405
00:44:53.811 --> 00:44:55.978
Yeah, the man outside the station today.

406
00:44:56.061 --> 00:44:58.270
Oh. Do you mean your father?

407
00:44:59.228 --> 00:45:02.603
Why can't I say you sent me?
Why must it be your father?


408
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.436
Well, do whatever you want.
I'm nobody though.


409
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:18.811
Hey, I was just thinking.

410
00:45:21.603 --> 00:45:23.770
I'm worried
that I'll embarrass your father.


411
00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:28.770
My clothes are gross… and I smell.

412
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.686
I'm not presentable.

413
00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:44.270
Change into these.

414
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.770
Well now. This is different.

415
00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:12.895
So when should I bring
these back to you, then?


416
00:46:13.478 --> 00:46:16.603
Just keep them.
They don't belong to anyone.


417
00:46:18.436 --> 00:46:20.186
I have more in there. Want them?

418
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.603
No. It's okay. I'm good.

419
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.895
Whoever hurt your lip,
you should stay far away from him.


420
00:46:35.978 --> 00:46:37.436
You deserve better than that.

421
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.353
Hurting a woman's face is disgraceful.

422
00:46:41.228 --> 00:46:43.436
Any man who'll do that once
is sure to do it again.


423
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.436
Oh.

424
00:46:57.603 --> 00:46:59.645
You made me a promise. Don't forget.

425
00:47:12.603 --> 00:47:14.561
CHOI RYUK-MYUNG, MALE
DOB: DEC. 1, 1990, HEALTHY


426
00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:16.853
Ch… Choi Ryuk-myung?

427
00:47:17.436 --> 00:47:18.270
Yeah.

428
00:47:18.353 --> 00:47:20.353
That's your name now. 
You're a new man.

429
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.395
It can be complicated
to find work for North Koreans.


430
00:47:25.061 --> 00:47:28.770
So when we're there, we'll tell everyone
that you're Chinese-Korean.


431
00:47:28.853 --> 00:47:30.103
Ah, of course.

432
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.353
Thank you so much, comrade.

433
00:47:34.853 --> 00:47:36.770
Don't mention it.

434
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.186
Did the money I sent come through?
It's been two days.


435
00:48:02.395 --> 00:48:03.520
Hey!

436
00:48:05.395 --> 00:48:06.478
Hey, I've gotta go.

437
00:48:06.561 --> 00:48:08.686
If you have any trouble,
Seon-ju will help you out.


438
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.145
-She's actually Chinese-Korean.
-Thank you.


439
00:48:12.895 --> 00:48:14.478
Take good care of him, Seon-ju.

440
00:48:24.061 --> 00:48:25.270
All right. Let's go in.

441
00:48:55.603 --> 00:48:58.478
Who brought that idiot here? Seriously.

442
00:49:25.353 --> 00:49:27.145
Hey, comrades! 
I'm trapped in here!

443
00:49:27.228 --> 00:49:28.603
Please open the door!

444
00:49:30.645 --> 00:49:32.436
Comrades! I'm sealed in here!

445
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.853
Comrades, help! 
Someone please let me out!

446
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.270
If you press this button,
the door will open from the inside.


447
00:49:58.353 --> 00:50:00.395
The green button. 
Do you understand?

448
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.686
Yes.

449
00:50:03.645 --> 00:50:05.436
-I was right, so pay up.
-I was so close.


450
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.895
You owe me, dog.

451
00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:10.936
Beat it! Go to work!

452
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.645
-Go to work!
-Sure, Mom.


453
00:50:12.728 --> 00:50:15.936
-What the fuck did she say? Walk away.
-Hey, man, just calm down. Get a grip.


454
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.770
Those bastards all decided to place bets
on how long you'd be stuck in the freezer.


455
00:50:19.853 --> 00:50:21.811
-Huh.
-They like to play tricks on the newbies.


456
00:50:21.895 --> 00:50:23.103
But just ignore them.

457
00:50:23.811 --> 00:50:25.186
Go and do the rest now.

458
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:27.186
Okay.

459
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:28.103
Damn, those guys at work
sure are infuriating. They're assholes.


460
00:51:28.895 --> 00:51:32.728
They do that to every newbie.
Trap them in that freezer as a sick joke.


461
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:34.645
It's not personal, just so you know.

462
00:51:40.728 --> 00:51:43.603
What's wrong? Is the meat
not good enough for you, or what?


463
00:51:43.686 --> 00:51:46.061
Why would someone with a job steal food?

464
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.603
That meat doesn't belong to either of us.

465
00:51:52.353 --> 00:51:55.311
Listen, this shoebox apartment
is 200 a month,


466
00:51:55.395 --> 00:51:56.978
and the bus is 50
bucks or more a month.

467
00:51:57.061 --> 00:51:59.436
My money's completely gone
by the time I need to buy any food.


468
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.186
So, in my eyes, this is what's fair.

469
00:52:09.186 --> 00:52:11.270
You know how they pat us down
when we all head home?


470
00:52:11.353 --> 00:52:13.978
Well, it turns out they wouldn't dare
pat down a woman's chest.


471
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:16.686
So it'd be dumb of me not to steal.
That's how I see it.


472
00:52:24.686 --> 00:52:27.103
I do it all for them.
My kids are my whole world.


473
00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:29.686
The one in the middle
looks so mischievous.


474
00:52:30.436 --> 00:52:34.145
He looks like a general.
So military with his shaved head.


475
00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:35.728
That's my daughter.

476
00:52:36.895 --> 00:52:39.228
She's needed brain surgeries,
so we've had to shave her head.


477
00:52:39.936 --> 00:52:41.478
-Ah…
-It's no big deal, hmm?


478
00:52:41.561 --> 00:52:43.853
The poor kid still has
one more surgery though.


479
00:52:45.478 --> 00:52:48.936
Afterwards, I'll be able to braid her hair
and send her off to school.


480
00:52:51.603 --> 00:52:54.020
Well, uh, she's very brave.

481
00:52:57.895 --> 00:53:01.353
Thank you. I think I'm pretty full.
The rest of it's yours.


482
00:53:01.436 --> 00:53:03.020
Comrade, eat more meat.

483
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.353
You have it.

484
00:53:04.895 --> 00:53:06.936
Actually, I'm sick of meat.

485
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.728
The smell gets to me
since we're surrounded by it all day.


486
00:53:11.228 --> 00:53:13.520
And stop saying comrades.
Don't you wanna blend in?


487
00:53:13.603 --> 00:53:16.561
If you keep saying comrades,
everyone will know you're not from here.


488
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:32.353
Who's got time for love? Not me.

489
00:53:32.436 --> 00:53:34.561
I see the same guy every night.

490
00:53:36.395 --> 00:53:38.061
Look, there he is, catching the bus!

491
00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:39.978
That's the guy I was telling you about.

492
00:53:46.061 --> 00:53:48.853
Let's get away this weekend.
Wanna meet up?


493
00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:54.686
Well, I really want to,
so let's go later.


494
00:53:55.478 --> 00:53:57.520
Ah. Yeah, he's a simp.

495
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:08.145
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for today's main event.


496
00:54:08.228 --> 00:54:11.020
The women's target shooting spectacular
is about to begin,


497
00:54:11.103 --> 00:54:13.686
so please grab your drinks
and find your seats!


498
00:54:15.436 --> 00:54:18.061
First up is
the international sensation herself,


499
00:54:18.145 --> 00:54:20.228
hailing all the way from the Netherlands,

500
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:22.145
Julia!

501
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.853
Tonight, she's facing off against
the pride of Belgium,


502
00:54:26.936 --> 00:54:28.978
our very own Marie!

503
00:54:31.103 --> 00:54:33.311
Each player will take one practice shot

504
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:35.603
before we begin
the first match of the set.


505
00:54:35.686 --> 00:54:38.020
You have one minute until betting closes.

506
00:54:38.103 --> 00:54:41.061
So hurry up, everyone,
and make your choice!


507
00:55:40.061 --> 00:55:41.478
Marie, what is it?

508
00:55:44.103 --> 00:55:45.186
What is this?

509
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.603
-Were you never planning to tell me?
-Just give it here.


510
00:55:50.686 --> 00:55:51.978
You killed her?

511
00:55:52.645 --> 00:55:53.936
Euthanasia?

512
00:55:54.645 --> 00:55:56.270
So Mom didn't just die, then.

513
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.103
-You were the one who killed her.
-I can explain everything, Marie.


514
00:56:02.186 --> 00:56:03.853
Just listen to me for once, hmm?

515
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.603
-It's not what you think
-Why did you lie to me?


516
00:56:11.895 --> 00:56:14.561
-Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
-Your mom wanted this.


517
00:56:15.686 --> 00:56:17.686
She knew you wouldn't have
been able to handle this.


518
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.353
Don't you dare put this on her!
You know that's not it, huh?


519
00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:24.186
You knew that I wouldn't let her
go through with it.


520
00:56:25.186 --> 00:56:26.603
So you did it while I was training.

521
00:56:26.686 --> 00:56:29.395
Marie, listen. It wasn't like that.
I promise, okay?


522
00:56:29.478 --> 00:56:30.686
It wasn't like that.

523
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:32.811
Just let me explain.

524
00:56:35.103 --> 00:56:37.020
Don't panic, ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:56:37.103 --> 00:56:40.103
In the meantime,
here's some info for tonight's drawing.


526
00:56:40.186 --> 00:56:42.520
You each should have a ticket.
Turn them over.


527
00:56:43.061 --> 00:56:45.603
-You should see a number there, right?
-Give me five minutes.


528
00:56:46.186 --> 00:56:47.936
I haven't done this in a while.

529
00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.103
After tonight's game,
we'll do a raffle drawing.


530
00:56:50.186 --> 00:56:52.020
I hope you're all excited.

531
00:56:52.103 --> 00:56:54.728
Who's ready to see
some more grade-A shooting?


532
00:56:58.353 --> 00:57:00.478
You're trembling like a terrified puppy.

533
00:57:31.895 --> 00:57:34.270
All right, folks,
that was the end of the fourth match.


534
00:57:34.353 --> 00:57:37.395
It's now time to wait
as the scores are tallied.


535
00:57:37.478 --> 00:57:39.145
Will we have a winner now,

536
00:57:39.228 --> 00:57:41.645
or will we continue
on to a fifth round?

537
00:57:42.228 --> 00:57:45.103
Without further delay,
let's now reveal Marie's results.


538
00:57:46.478 --> 00:57:48.520
Forty-eight points!

539
00:57:48.603 --> 00:57:49.811
It's a tie!

540
00:57:50.603 --> 00:57:52.311
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

541
00:57:52.395 --> 00:57:53.645
Here you go.

542
00:57:54.811 --> 00:57:56.061
Four!

543
00:57:56.145 --> 00:57:57.103
Three!

544
00:57:57.186 --> 00:57:58.645
Two! One!

545
00:57:58.728 --> 00:58:02.061
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
Betting is now closed.


546
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.520
Here we go!

547
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:18.770
Now Marie.
Will she break under pressure?


548
00:58:18.853 --> 00:58:21.520
Or will she shoot her way to victory?

549
00:58:21.603 --> 00:58:23.145
Let us see!

550
00:58:48.478 --> 00:58:49.603
All right!

551
00:58:49.686 --> 00:58:51.978
And now let's see her final score!

552
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:55.603
10.4! What an incredible finish, my God!

553
00:58:55.686 --> 00:58:58.770
By two tenths of a point,
Marie is the winner!


554
00:58:58.853 --> 00:59:00.103
She had her eye on the prize!

555
00:59:00.186 --> 00:59:02.395
Make some noise for Marie!

556
00:59:02.478 --> 00:59:08.561
Marie! Marie! Marie!
Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie!


557
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:12.186
Fuck yeah!

558
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.395
Didn't I tell ya you'd win?

559
00:59:20.853 --> 00:59:24.270
Did you see the look on Gerd's face?
I think he fell in love with you.


560
00:59:25.811 --> 00:59:27.936
He said he won't pull out his investment.

561
00:59:28.561 --> 00:59:30.853
You should see him before you go.

562
00:59:31.353 --> 00:59:32.853
I've got somewhere to be.

563
00:59:33.978 --> 00:59:36.103
Are you kidding? Hmm.

564
00:59:36.603 --> 00:59:38.436
I've been trying
to get him here for years.


565
00:59:39.311 --> 00:59:41.395
We need him to help expand our business.

566
00:59:43.103 --> 00:59:45.561
Listen, I won. 
Just give me the wallet.

567
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.270
I should go.

568
01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:17.061
Eat with me.

569
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
Have you eaten yet?

570
01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:22.270
What?

571
01:01:23.978 --> 01:01:25.853
Can I please borrow some of your meat?

572
01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:28.270
-Are you sure? I stole it.
-Yes, yes, thank you.


573
01:01:33.061 --> 01:01:35.353
-Thank you. You're kind, comrade.
-Mm-hmm.


574
01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:10.686
Comrade, comrade.

575
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:11.853
Do you need something else?

576
01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:12.936
Any lettuce?

577
01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:35.895
Utensils.

578
01:02:35.978 --> 01:02:37.020
Ah…

579
01:02:37.811 --> 01:02:39.895
I brought you some bowls, too,
just in case.


580
01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:42.436
-Uh…
-Just don't forget to wash it all, okay?


581
01:02:42.978 --> 01:02:44.103
Thank you, comrade.

582
01:03:13.436 --> 01:03:15.311
Why are you standing? Sit down.

583
01:03:18.353 --> 01:03:20.895
Eat it while it's hot.
I know it's not much.


584
01:03:22.936 --> 01:03:26.228
Did you buy all this?
Where'd you get the money?


585
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:28.270
I didn't have to buy it. 
It was all free.

586
01:03:28.353 --> 01:03:29.603
Huh?

587
01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:36.061
It's not from the trash, so don't worry.

588
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:40.728
Early in the morning, by North Station,
they give us free food.


589
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.686
I go by every day
and pick the things I want.


590
01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:52.353
I'll get going.

591
01:04:53.103 --> 01:04:54.020
All right.

592
01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.353
Don't walk me out.

593
01:05:00.145 --> 01:05:02.603
I want to. It's dark outside.

594
01:05:07.186 --> 01:05:10.145
-Tea? Who wants some tea?
-Huh? What's going on?


595
01:05:10.228 --> 01:05:11.561
Wow, it's 9:00 already?

596
01:05:12.311 --> 01:05:15.895
My neighbor offers tea at night.
He does this every night around 9:00.


597
01:05:16.478 --> 01:05:19.645
-Tea! Anyone want tea?
-Let's have some. I'll leave after.


598
01:05:19.728 --> 01:05:22.103
No, wait, hold on.
Don't. Don't go quite yet.


599
01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:25.436
Tea, everyone! Nice and hot!

600
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.353
I'm not allowed to have guests.
He can't know that you're here.


601
01:05:29.645 --> 01:05:31.020
We'll have to wait.

602
01:05:31.103 --> 01:05:32.853
Okay, okay, that's enough.

603
01:05:32.936 --> 01:05:34.686
Careful now, it's hot.

604
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.103
Quiet.

605
01:05:38.186 --> 01:05:40.561
Come one, come all! I have tea!

606
01:05:45.353 --> 01:05:46.936
Get your tea!

607
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.978
Nice and hot! Come and get it.

608
01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:52.020
It's ginger with a touch of citrus.

609
01:05:52.103 --> 01:05:53.145
Get your tea.

610
01:05:59.228 --> 01:06:01.145
Hey, do you want any tea tonight, Kiwan?

611
01:06:04.645 --> 01:06:07.520
Cut it out! You're too loud!
Stop your racket!


612
01:06:07.603 --> 01:06:09.395
He's trying to rest! Huh?

613
01:06:11.853 --> 01:06:13.395
What a bitch.

614
01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:22.895
Last chance! Get your tea!

615
01:06:26.936 --> 01:06:29.436
All right, I'm leaving! Last chance!

616
01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.186
Last call for tea!

617
01:06:37.895 --> 01:06:39.270
No one? Anyone?

618
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.520
We will start recording now.

619
01:06:47.645 --> 01:06:51.311
This photo here is from 1997.

620
01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.561
It was May Day.

621
01:06:54.145 --> 01:06:57.270
We had joined a delegation
that went to Pyongyang to celebrate.


622
01:06:58.145 --> 01:07:00.353
It's my mother and I.

623
01:07:00.436 --> 01:07:02.895
She held me in her arms
at Kim Il Sung Square.


624
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.228
"The photos
will be submitted as evidence."


625
01:07:10.311 --> 01:07:13.353
"And after we scan them for you,
we'll return it to you."


626
01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.645
"Uh, we also contacted
Cheonsim Hospital,


627
01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:25.603
which you had mentioned
during your first interview."


628
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:29.936
"The hospital stated, unequivocally,
that they've never been involved


629
01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.936
with the purchase or sale
of corpses or body parts at any point."


630
01:07:39.395 --> 01:07:43.103
They're lying. The buying and selling
of bodies happens secretly underground.


631
01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:46.853
It's not the sort of thing
the hospital would admit to, right?


632
01:07:54.811 --> 01:07:57.895
"You'll have to
prove your nationality some other way."


633
01:07:57.978 --> 01:08:00.020
"At this time,
you won't receive refugee status


634
01:08:00.103 --> 01:08:02.561
because you can't prove
you defected from North Korea."


635
01:08:04.395 --> 01:08:07.020
Didn't I tell you
everything you asked me?


636
01:08:07.103 --> 01:08:09.103
Why would I lie to you two?
You don't believe me?


637
01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:23.895
"I'm sorry.
It's difficult to believe your statement


638
01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:26.353
about your mother's body
being sold illegally


639
01:08:26.436 --> 01:08:27.770
to Cheonsim Hospital."

640
01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:30.728
"And since there's no proof
backing up your claim


641
01:08:30.811 --> 01:08:32.645
that you really are a defector
from North Korea,


642
01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:34.228
we won't be able to help you."

643
01:08:34.811 --> 01:08:35.936
Mmm.

644
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.436
"Lastly, if we rule
that the photo you provided


645
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.895
fails to constitute as valid evidence,

646
01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:43.020
you'll have to go."

647
01:08:43.103 --> 01:08:45.853
"You will be
forcibly repatriated to China."


648
01:08:52.353 --> 01:08:54.061
You're saying I'll be deported?

649
01:09:04.686 --> 01:09:06.686
Hey, do it again.
The meat still has fat on it.


650
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:07.853
Cut around the sides.

651
01:09:09.186 --> 01:09:10.103
Hey, comrade.

652
01:09:11.561 --> 01:09:13.728
How can you tell
if I'm really North Korean?


653
01:09:13.811 --> 01:09:16.311
Well, for one,
you always say comrade when talking.


654
01:09:16.395 --> 01:09:18.311
And, uh, just the way you look.

655
01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:20.686
Koreans have
a totally different bone structure.


656
01:09:29.103 --> 01:09:30.395
Comrade Seon-ju…

657
01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:36.520
Uh, never mind.

658
01:09:37.478 --> 01:09:39.103
Hey, what's on your mind, huh?

659
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.270
Just spit it out.

660
01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:45.645
Hey, what is it, hmm?

661
01:09:47.853 --> 01:09:51.936
Do you think you might speak on my behalf
down at the courthouse?


662
01:09:52.603 --> 01:09:55.061
I think it might help
if I had a witness by my side.


663
01:09:56.311 --> 01:09:58.811
Of course I can. 
That's no big deal.

664
01:10:00.228 --> 01:10:01.311
-Do you mean that? Huh?
-Yes!


665
01:10:01.395 --> 01:10:03.103
You'd really come, comrade?

666
01:10:03.686 --> 01:10:04.561
For sure.

667
01:10:05.395 --> 01:10:06.395
Oh, great.

668
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.770
And besides, I really need good karma soon

669
01:10:11.853 --> 01:10:14.061
'cause my daughter
is about to have surgery.


670
01:10:14.145 --> 01:10:15.228
Thank you, comrade.

671
01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:18.311
Hey, if I end up getting refugee status,
it will all be thanks to you.


672
01:10:18.395 --> 01:10:20.936
Hey, if you wanna pay it forward,
then get me something.


673
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.020
Lately, I've been craving for fish.
You got that?


674
01:10:24.103 --> 01:10:25.186
Okay, you got it.

675
01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:27.061
What would you like?

676
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:29.103
Sea bream? Two? Okay.

677
01:10:40.895 --> 01:10:42.395
Oh.

678
01:10:42.478 --> 01:10:43.770
-My beer.
-Oh, pardon me.


679
01:10:43.853 --> 01:10:46.145
-What did you do to my beer, huh?
-Sorry.


680
01:10:46.228 --> 01:10:47.228
Hey!

681
01:10:47.311 --> 01:10:49.061
This asshole dropped my beer.

682
01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.270
What the hell, man?
Hey! Tough guy! What's this?


683
01:10:52.353 --> 01:10:54.728
-Give that back.
-Want it back? Then come get it. Huh?


684
01:10:54.811 --> 01:10:57.270
Do you like it? Do you like it?
You wanna go, huh?


685
01:10:57.936 --> 01:11:01.145
Here, take it. 
Get outta here!

686
01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:03.603
-Go home!
-Yeah.


687
01:11:06.853 --> 01:11:08.978
-You owe me a beer.
-Buy me a beer!


688
01:11:09.061 --> 01:11:11.186
Oh!

689
01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:16.061
The fuck, man? 
Look what you did.

690
01:11:16.145 --> 01:11:17.811
-You're not gonna get away with this.
-Hey!


691
01:11:17.895 --> 01:11:19.561
-We need help! He's hurt!
-Hey!


692
01:11:21.395 --> 01:11:22.978
-Call the police! You're dead.
-God!


693
01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:25.520
-Get the police! We need help!
-Help us, somebody!


694
01:11:25.603 --> 01:11:26.853
My husband is getting attacked!

695
01:11:26.936 --> 01:11:29.645
-Help! This guy's crazy!
-Oh no! Someone call the cops!


696
01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:31.520
Help him!

697
01:11:31.603 --> 01:11:33.936
Someone please call an ambulance!

698
01:11:41.478 --> 01:11:43.561
I told you I'm not going. 
Stop calling me.

699
01:11:46.145 --> 01:11:50.478
<i>Marie, did you recommend</i>
<i>someone to the factory by chance?</i>


700
01:11:51.645 --> 01:11:53.020
So what if I did, hmm?

701
01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.770
<i>What a monstrosity!</i>

702
01:11:57.853 --> 01:12:00.561
<i>He came out of nowhere</i>
<i>and lunged at my husband.</i>


703
01:12:00.645 --> 01:12:02.603
<i>And he attacked him for no reason!</i>

704
01:12:04.478 --> 01:12:05.728
Miss, you're next.

705
01:12:10.436 --> 01:12:12.811
Uh, Loh Kiwan.
He was in the assault from last night.


706
01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:15.103
-Are you a relative or his lawyer?
-No.


707
01:12:15.186 --> 01:12:16.853
Then, no, I can't let you visit him.

708
01:12:18.145 --> 01:12:21.561
-I just wanna see his face for a moment.
-It's not possible, miss.


709
01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:26.645
-So what'll happen to him, then?
-He'll have three days to file an appeal.


710
01:12:26.728 --> 01:12:29.520
If he doesn't,
the deportation process will begin.


711
01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:31.520
Or, if you want,
you can pay his bail.

712
01:12:35.478 --> 01:12:37.061
-Shit!
-Calm down, miss.


713
01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:39.186
May I remind you
this is a police station?

714
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:42.895
Hey.

715
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.520
You're a police officer, right?

716
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:48.395
-This is insane.
-Please calm down, miss.


717
01:12:48.478 --> 01:12:49.603
Hey, I'm not finished.

718
01:12:52.145 --> 01:12:55.520
If he's deported,
then you're condemning him to die.


719
01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:57.145
Be a police officer, huh?

720
01:12:57.728 --> 01:12:59.478
Carry out justice!

721
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.978
Marie.

722
01:13:22.103 --> 01:13:23.228
Wait a second.

723
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:27.520
Go. I have things to do.

724
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:42.020
Here, take this.
He's a trusted friend. A good lawyer.


725
01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:45.853
I heard that you've been
undergoing refugee screening.


726
01:13:45.936 --> 01:13:47.936
I think he could
really help out your case.


727
01:13:48.436 --> 01:13:49.895
Oh, thank you.

728
01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:52.728
This means so much to me… sir.

729
01:13:53.895 --> 01:13:55.853
I have one request, however.

730
01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:58.145
Yes, please go ahead, sir.

731
01:13:58.228 --> 01:13:59.353
My daughter.

732
01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:04.603
She's a very vulnerable girl.
I really want her to get better.


733
01:14:05.603 --> 01:14:09.020
She needs someone strong.
Someone who can support her.


734
01:14:09.936 --> 01:14:13.311
Not someone
who's just as unstable as she is.


735
01:14:15.061 --> 01:14:17.145
Uh, excuse me, sir--

736
01:14:17.228 --> 01:14:19.561
I don't think
you should see my daughter anymore.


737
01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:22.936
You have too much
going on in your life.

738
01:14:23.436 --> 01:14:27.186
Staying in this country
is your only top priority, Kiwan.


739
01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.061
Hi, Kiwan.

740
01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:20.853
-So today's the big day.
-Are you ready?


741
01:15:21.853 --> 01:15:23.603
-Yes.
-You'll be great.


742
01:15:32.145 --> 01:15:33.145
TRIBUNAL OF BRUSSELS

743
01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.353
During his first interview two months ago,

744
01:15:35.436 --> 01:15:37.811
Mr. Loh, uh, provided specific information

745
01:15:37.895 --> 01:15:40.728
that a North Korean citizen
would only know.


746
01:15:41.228 --> 01:15:44.270
However, his request
was contested shortly after,


747
01:15:44.353 --> 01:15:45.853
claiming insufficient proof.

748
01:15:45.936 --> 01:15:47.561
Can you explain this lack of proof,

749
01:15:47.645 --> 01:15:49.728
as it was the reason
that this request was denied?


750
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:54.395
The hospital to which Mr. Loh here
claims to have sold his own mother's body


751
01:15:54.895 --> 01:15:56.936
denies this obscene and false accusation.

752
01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.936
The prosecution doesn't believe
her body was sold.


753
01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.270
The two photos Mr. Loh provided
were confirmed to be of Pyongyang, yes,


754
01:16:02.353 --> 01:16:05.603
but they could have been taken
by Chinese travelers on vacation.


755
01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.895
We believe these photos fail
to prove Mr. Loh's claim


756
01:16:08.978 --> 01:16:11.061
that he is indeed a North Korean national.

757
01:16:11.145 --> 01:16:12.520
Therefore, insufficient.

758
01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:15.311
Furthermore, Mr. Loh claims
to have lived in the city of Yanji…


759
01:16:15.395 --> 01:16:17.978
The prosecution doesn't believe
you have enough evidence…


760
01:16:18.061 --> 01:16:20.936
According to our investigation,
there is nothing to support this story.


761
01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.353
…so we may need to provide
stronger proof for your claim.


762
01:16:23.436 --> 01:16:25.103
Have the witnesses arrived?

763
01:16:43.436 --> 01:16:45.436
The résumé Mr. Loh provided

764
01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:48.436
was indicative he was from Yanji, China.

765
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.186
I didn't have a reason to doubt him,

766
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:52.353
so he was introduced as Chinese
at the factory.


767
01:16:52.436 --> 01:16:56.311
Did Mr. Loh identify himself to you
as a Chinese-born ethnic Korean


768
01:16:56.395 --> 01:16:57.686
and not as a defector?

769
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:59.645
Sir, please take your time answering.

770
01:16:59.728 --> 01:17:02.436
We just want you
to recall all of the events properly.


771
01:17:04.436 --> 01:17:06.853
Yes. That's exactly what he said.

772
01:17:08.145 --> 01:17:09.895
-Sir, you're lying.
-Silence, sir.


773
01:17:09.978 --> 01:17:11.353
-Calm your client.
-Pardon.


774
01:17:11.853 --> 01:17:13.186
Mr. Loh. Mr. Loh.

775
01:17:14.395 --> 01:17:15.270
Let's hear them out.

776
01:17:15.353 --> 01:17:18.436
I now call Ms. Kim Seon-ju.
Please step forward.


777
01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:27.103
I see you worked alongside Mr. Loh
over at the factory.


778
01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:32.436
Were you aware Mr. Loh applied
for North Korean refugee status?


779
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.311
Please take your time answering, Ms. Kim,
and please remember you're under oath.


780
01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:39.811
The testimony that you give
will be used as evidence in this hearing.


781
01:17:39.895 --> 01:17:41.020
You may proceed.

782
01:17:41.978 --> 01:17:44.228
Your Honor. Yes, I was aware.

783
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:48.478
There are many people who are mixed
Korean and Chinese who take advantage


784
01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:51.561
by saying they are defectors
from North Korea when they aren't.


785
01:17:51.645 --> 01:17:54.811
They pretend to be North Korean defectors
immigrating for refugee benefits.


786
01:17:55.645 --> 01:17:57.936
I suspected Mr. 
Loh might be one of them.

787
01:17:59.353 --> 01:18:01.770
Do you know Mr. Loh's Chinese name?
What is it?


788
01:18:01.853 --> 01:18:06.186
Ms. Kim, please tell us
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.


789
01:18:08.561 --> 01:18:10.020
Choi Ryuk-myung.

790
01:18:10.103 --> 01:18:12.186
"Cui Liming," what we say in Mandarin.

791
01:18:24.936 --> 01:18:26.020
Choi Ryung-myung?

792
01:18:27.895 --> 01:18:29.686
You know that's not my real name.

793
01:18:34.145 --> 01:18:35.603
So why did you lie up there?

794
01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.645
Tell me, comrade.

795
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:42.270
Betraying me like that, was it worth it?

796
01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.186
You told me the other day…

797
01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:49.436
that it was obvious that I'm North Korean.

798
01:18:51.061 --> 01:18:52.061
I wanna know why.

799
01:19:00.145 --> 01:19:01.353
I deserve to know why.

800
01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.561
-What are you doing, Kiwan?
-Comrade.


801
01:19:03.645 --> 01:19:04.978
Kiwan, let go!

802
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:06.603
Tell me!

803
01:19:11.645 --> 01:19:12.728
Why'd you do it?

804
01:19:15.395 --> 01:19:16.978
Why did you do that to me?

805
01:19:18.228 --> 01:19:19.436
Kiwan!

806
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.061
Kiwan, you're… you're hurt. Let go.

807
01:20:00.103 --> 01:20:01.186
What do you want?

808
01:20:03.186 --> 01:20:04.603
Did you leave something here?

809
01:20:05.103 --> 01:20:06.186
Uh, no.

810
01:20:07.228 --> 01:20:08.228
I just…

811
01:20:13.895 --> 01:20:15.811
You can't just show up here
out of nowhere.


812
01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:34.686
Start preparing for your next match.

813
01:20:36.228 --> 01:20:38.603
Gerd will be there.
We need him to work with us.


814
01:20:40.895 --> 01:20:42.561
You came here just to say that?

815
01:20:52.436 --> 01:20:55.561
-Coaches are supposed to be tough, Marie.
-Stop breathing down my neck.


816
01:21:02.186 --> 01:21:05.603
I don't need your shit anymore.
I'm fine without drugs these days.


817
01:21:05.686 --> 01:21:07.436
It sure didn't seem like that last time.

818
01:21:12.228 --> 01:21:13.645
Listen to me.

819
01:21:13.728 --> 01:21:15.311
I don't give a fuck about your refugee!

820
01:21:15.395 --> 01:21:18.145
But do as I say!
You still need to pay your debt to me.


821
01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:20.561
So you better stay within my sight,
you got that?


822
01:21:21.395 --> 01:21:22.353
You're mine.

823
01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:01.270
FREE

824
01:23:21.186 --> 01:23:23.020
Gerd put down three million on you.

825
01:23:24.103 --> 01:23:26.770
If we can double that,
that's half our debt all paid off.


826
01:23:27.978 --> 01:23:30.353
I rigged the game.
You're guaranteed to win.


827
01:23:31.436 --> 01:23:32.811
So just have fun out there.

828
01:23:41.478 --> 01:23:43.436
Chloe! Chloe!

829
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520
The tension is palpable, folks!

830
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.186
Now it's time for Chloe's last shot!

831
01:23:54.936 --> 01:23:56.145
8.2 for Chloe!

832
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.311
Nice work, Chloe!

833
01:24:00.936 --> 01:24:02.770
Hey! Learn to shoot!

834
01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:29.561
What the fuck?

835
01:24:30.478 --> 01:24:33.395
What a disaster!
She missed the entire target.


836
01:24:33.478 --> 01:24:34.811
What just happened, folks?

837
01:24:35.478 --> 01:24:38.561
In this unprecedented event,
Chloe wins the match!


838
01:24:39.186 --> 01:24:41.728
Now, please, folks, calm yourselves!

839
01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:45.145
Please don't throw anything!
Folks, please restrain yourselves!


840
01:24:45.811 --> 01:24:48.520
Where the hell
do you think you're going, huh?


841
01:24:48.603 --> 01:24:50.228
You're on your own from now on.

842
01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.811
Listen, you won't survive out there
without me. You're nothing!


843
01:24:56.478 --> 01:24:57.395
No.

844
01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:00.061
You're wrong.

845
01:25:04.853 --> 01:25:05.770
Damn it!

846
01:25:32.145 --> 01:25:32.978
Kiwan, hey.

847
01:25:33.686 --> 01:25:35.853
Hey, listen to me, Kiwan. Wait!

848
01:25:35.936 --> 01:25:37.936
Before the trial,
a person from the refugee office


849
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.520
came to the factory.

850
01:25:39.603 --> 01:25:42.770
They said they would shut us down if
they learned your documents were forged.


851
01:25:42.853 --> 01:25:46.395
So that's why we let you take the fall
for everyone else's sake.


852
01:25:46.478 --> 01:25:50.061
He said I wouldn't get my visa renewed
if I didn't lie about everything.


853
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.978
My, um, my daughter's operation
is very soon,


854
01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:54.645
and she relies on my wages.

855
01:25:55.395 --> 01:25:57.436
In the end, it turns out
he didn't even renew my visa.


856
01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.270
What do you want me
to say to you, hmm?

857
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.270
Oh, that's too bad.
It must've been hard for you.


858
01:26:02.353 --> 01:26:04.478
No, hey! Don't go!

859
01:26:05.311 --> 01:26:07.311
I just really want to apologize to you.

860
01:26:09.103 --> 01:26:12.311
I'm being deported soon.
I got caught without a visa.


861
01:26:12.895 --> 01:26:15.061
I'll be back in China with my children,

862
01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:18.228
so I don't think I will ever be
in Belgium again, so, uh…


863
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.811
I had to see you before I leave.

864
01:26:22.228 --> 01:26:25.770
I'm so sorry… comrade Loh Kiwan.

865
01:27:02.561 --> 01:27:05.645
I heard back from
a well-known defectors' advocacy group.


866
01:27:08.186 --> 01:27:12.436
They'll submit a statement of support,
and they'll even attend your next trial.


867
01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.478
This will definitely help
increase your credibility, I believe.


868
01:27:17.145 --> 01:27:19.061
Don't give up hope yet, okay?

869
01:27:20.645 --> 01:27:21.520
Okay.

870
01:27:22.145 --> 01:27:24.770
Would you like something to drink?
A juice or coffee?


871
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:26.395
Juice, please.

872
01:27:33.436 --> 01:27:36.270
IN MEMORY OF LEE JEONG
-JU

873
01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:40.686
DAUGHTER: LEE MARIE

874
01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:56.686
What are you doing here?

875
01:27:57.645 --> 01:28:01.603
Once I found out this was happening today,
it felt wrong not to come.


876
01:28:04.186 --> 01:28:06.270
So I'd like to pay my respects
by helping out.


877
01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:23.353
My wife left us all
three years ago, as you know.


878
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.061
This will be my family's
last public memorial service.


879
01:28:30.186 --> 01:28:33.353
Moving forward,
we will get together privately


880
01:28:34.436 --> 01:28:36.270
to honor her and her legacy.

881
01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:41.728
Marie.

882
01:28:44.103 --> 01:28:46.603
Got a good turnout, I see.

883
01:28:47.686 --> 01:28:48.603
Marie.

884
01:28:52.353 --> 01:28:53.395
Ah…

885
01:28:54.603 --> 01:28:57.561
Everyone's so dressed
and eating such nice food,


886
01:28:57.645 --> 01:28:59.436
all for someone that's dead.

887
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.770
What does this accomplish?

888
01:29:05.145 --> 01:29:06.186
Go be sad at home.

889
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:09.520
Why do this when it's all just
one big show for you, huh?


890
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:14.145
What?

891
01:29:15.395 --> 01:29:18.936
Are you afraid people might
point fingers if they knew what you did?


892
01:29:19.436 --> 01:29:20.436
Stop this!

893
01:29:21.228 --> 01:29:22.436
Stop what?

894
01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:27.478
Stop what, Dad?

895
01:29:29.936 --> 01:29:31.770
What did I do? What?

896
01:29:31.853 --> 01:29:34.228
I told you to stop! 
You need to leave!

897
01:29:34.978 --> 01:29:35.811
Ah!

898
01:29:36.853 --> 01:29:41.770
Listen! Because of your actions that day,
I no longer have a mother. She's dead.


899
01:29:41.853 --> 01:29:43.186
Put that down right now.

900
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:44.603
Do you know what you did?

901
01:29:46.395 --> 01:29:48.436
I died a long time ago. Understand?

902
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.436
I understand, hmm? 
Now give me that!

903
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.228
Get the fuck away!

904
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:58.978
Stay away from me! Don't you ever dare
tell me what to do anymore, okay? Okay?


905
01:30:40.603 --> 01:30:43.103
Marie, open the door, please!
Marie!


906
01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:51.353
Marie! Marie!

907
01:31:00.853 --> 01:31:03.645
The floor is like jelly.
Will I fall?


908
01:31:06.311 --> 01:31:09.561
The floor is wobbling.
It's too damn much.


909
01:31:10.895 --> 01:31:12.270
It's jelly!

910
01:31:13.061 --> 01:31:14.436
I'm seasick.

911
01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.770
Just sit down. 
Standing is bad shit.

912
01:31:16.853 --> 01:31:20.478
Yeah, just sit. Nice.
Who is this guy?


913
01:31:20.978 --> 01:31:23.436
Huh? What?

914
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.478
-Who is this clown?
-You're here.


915
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:29.728
Is the circus in town?
Where'd you come from?


916
01:31:29.811 --> 01:31:32.645
-I came from the North.
-This you on vacation? Oh, Marie.


917
01:31:32.728 --> 01:31:35.811
Want a vacation?
This will take you far away.


918
01:31:35.895 --> 01:31:37.020
Good girl.

919
01:31:37.103 --> 01:31:39.811
Hey! Are you insane?

920
01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:40.853
Crazy bastard!

921
01:31:44.895 --> 01:31:46.478
Marie.

922
01:31:46.561 --> 01:31:48.561
Marie.

923
01:31:48.645 --> 01:31:50.520
Marie, give it to me.

924
01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.228
Let go!

925
01:31:55.645 --> 01:31:57.686
Shit. Shit.

926
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:59.811
Fuck off! You don't get to stop me!

927
01:32:06.895 --> 01:32:07.728
-Marie!
-Let go!


928
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:08.645
Stop this!

929
01:32:09.645 --> 01:32:12.228
Do you want to die?
Is that what you want, huh?


930
01:32:12.311 --> 01:32:13.311
No.

931
01:32:14.145 --> 01:32:15.936
If I die, I can't do drugs.

932
01:32:16.645 --> 01:32:18.270
Why would I throw this all away?

933
01:32:19.228 --> 01:32:20.478
If you wanna die,

934
01:32:21.186 --> 01:32:22.728
then be my guest.

935
01:32:32.311 --> 01:32:33.270
Hey, wait.

936
01:32:33.853 --> 01:32:35.520
That's not yours! Give it!

937
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:38.436
Oh shit!

938
01:32:44.145 --> 01:32:45.186
That's mine!

939
01:33:05.353 --> 01:33:06.436
Hey, Kiwan.

940
01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.395
Hey!

941
01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.520
Hey, what's wrong? Spit it out!

942
01:33:14.603 --> 01:33:15.811
Spit it out!

943
01:33:15.895 --> 01:33:17.395
Kiwan, I said spit it out!

944
01:33:17.936 --> 01:33:18.895
Oh God!

945
01:33:19.436 --> 01:33:21.353
Hey.

946
01:33:21.436 --> 01:33:23.061
Kiwan, please wake up!

947
01:33:31.186 --> 01:33:32.061
Nicky!

948
01:33:32.145 --> 01:33:34.436
Open up! Open the door!

949
01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.561
Nicky!

950
01:33:37.728 --> 01:33:40.061
I need the… antidote!

951
01:33:40.603 --> 01:33:43.311
Hurry, get it! Hurry and get it!
Please hurry! Get it!


952
01:33:47.311 --> 01:33:48.603
Please, please.

953
01:34:04.645 --> 01:34:05.728
Hey, Kiwan.

954
01:34:07.603 --> 01:34:08.728
Are you okay?

955
01:34:13.145 --> 01:34:14.228
You're…

956
01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.436
You really are something.

957
01:34:18.061 --> 01:34:19.186
Why do you do…

958
01:34:21.145 --> 01:34:22.186
…that kind of stuff?

959
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:24.728
I was so worried about you.
Why did you do that?


960
01:34:27.436 --> 01:34:28.436
I'm sorry.

961
01:34:30.353 --> 01:34:31.478
It's my fault.

962
01:34:33.186 --> 01:34:34.811
I kept pushing you away.

963
01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:38.561
You're all bark but no bite. That's it.

964
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:42.186
You like to pretend you're cruel,
but you're not.


965
01:34:43.936 --> 01:34:46.186
Behind that tough act is a sweet girl.

966
01:34:48.853 --> 01:34:49.770
Marie.

967
01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:53.811
If you ever take drugs again,

968
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.020
I'll do what I just did.

969
01:34:57.895 --> 01:34:59.145
I'll do it again.

970
01:35:01.103 --> 01:35:03.978
If you ever try to hurt
or destroy yourself,


971
01:35:04.978 --> 01:35:07.520
I'll follow you to hell
and drag you out myself.


972
01:35:10.145 --> 01:35:11.936
I'll help you find the light.

973
01:35:14.395 --> 01:35:15.353
You go that?

974
01:36:24.603 --> 01:36:25.895
What is this of?

975
01:36:26.395 --> 01:36:28.270
It was my mom's favorite flower.

976
01:36:30.436 --> 01:36:31.436
Hmm.

977
01:36:33.853 --> 01:36:35.186
Well, it's pretty.

978
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:41.395
What happened here?

979
01:36:42.353 --> 01:36:43.270
Well,

980
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:48.103
when my mother… and I
ran from North Korea…


981
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:56.061
we both, um… we both carried
razor blades in our clothes.


982
01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:58.395
Why?

983
01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:01.478
Just in case the police

984
01:37:02.978 --> 01:37:06.311
tried to send us back there.
We both would have rather died.


985
01:37:08.103 --> 01:37:11.228
It was our backup plan.
We always carried them with us.


986
01:37:13.186 --> 01:37:14.811
So, on both our left wrists,

987
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:18.103
we ended up having
a few attempts together.


988
01:37:27.353 --> 01:37:28.270
Marie.

989
01:37:29.603 --> 01:37:30.561
Listen.

990
01:37:34.686 --> 01:37:37.395
When I was living in China,
I broke the law.


991
01:37:37.478 --> 01:37:41.103
I got involved in a fight at work.
I should've ignored it.


992
01:37:43.103 --> 01:37:45.770
The police were looking for me,
so I went into hiding.


993
01:37:47.186 --> 01:37:48.186
Ultimately…

994
01:37:51.145 --> 01:37:53.603
that circumstance led
to my mother's death.


995
01:37:56.686 --> 01:37:58.520
So, does someone like me…

996
01:38:01.978 --> 01:38:04.103
deserve to be happy despite what happened?

997
01:38:11.103 --> 01:38:13.020
I ask myself the same question.

998
01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.061
I'm like you.

999
01:38:22.103 --> 01:38:24.103
We might think we don't deserve a lot.

1000
01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:30.186
But at least we have each other.

1001
01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.020
And that's enough for me.

1002
01:38:59.561 --> 01:39:02.061
Uh, Marie, isn't this

1003
01:39:03.353 --> 01:39:04.978
a little too much? 
I feel overdressed.

1004
01:39:05.061 --> 01:39:07.145
A little overdressed is all right.

1005
01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.478
Like a true Belgian, hmm?

1006
01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.145
Mmm! How about that?

1007
01:39:14.978 --> 01:39:17.520
-Don't do that. There's people outside.
-Just kiss me!


1008
01:39:17.603 --> 01:39:18.561
-Mr. Loh.
-Kiss me back!


1009
01:39:18.645 --> 01:39:19.728
-Uh, ah…
-Mr. Hyeok.


1010
01:39:22.145 --> 01:39:23.561
Here. This just came from China.

1011
01:39:23.645 --> 01:39:25.395
-Really?
-You should open it and take a look.


1012
01:39:25.478 --> 01:39:27.978
Uh… Thank you so much.

1013
01:39:28.478 --> 01:39:29.603
I'll leave you two.

1014
01:39:29.686 --> 01:39:31.311
Oh, no…

1015
01:39:36.353 --> 01:39:37.978
KIM SEON
-JU

1016
01:39:39.978 --> 01:39:40.936
Open it.

1017
01:39:51.478 --> 01:39:52.978
<i>I've spent the past few days</i>

1018
01:39:53.061 --> 01:39:55.770
<i>going to all the newspaper archives</i>
<i>in Yanji.</i>


1019
01:39:56.853 --> 01:39:58.936
<i>I asked for all the newspapers</i>
<i>from last winter</i>


1020
01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.520
<i>and brought them home with me.</i>

1021
01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:03.145
<i>My kids and I read so many newspapers</i>

1022
01:40:03.228 --> 01:40:05.520
<i>that our fingertips</i>
<i>turned black from the ink.</i>


1023
01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:09.436
<i>My youngest, the one with the shaved head,</i>

1024
01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.353
<i>just learned to read,</i>

1025
01:40:12.436 --> 01:40:15.186
<i>I knew right away</i>

1026
01:40:16.853 --> 01:40:19.395
NORTH KOREAN WOMAN RAN INTO
SLIDING TRUCK ON SNOWY ROAD, DEAD


1027
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.811
<i>Comrade Kiwan,</i>

1028
01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:29.103
<i>I know I can't undo what I did to you,</i>
<i>and I don't expect forgiveness,</i>


1029
01:40:29.645 --> 01:40:32.686
<i>but I hope that
this will help your case.</i>

1030
01:40:33.853 --> 01:40:36.895
<i>Like your mom said,</i>
<i>you have to survive, comrade.</i>


1031
01:40:46.478 --> 01:40:49.270
-Oh, good. Look, they're here.
-I see.


1032
01:40:49.353 --> 01:40:50.520
-No, also…
-Ms. Gi Soon?


1033
01:40:50.603 --> 01:40:52.311
Hello, so good to see you.
How have you been?


1034
01:40:52.395 --> 01:40:53.561
-Good. And yourself?
-Good.


1035
01:40:53.645 --> 01:40:54.811
-Glad to hear.
-Oh, you too.


1036
01:40:54.895 --> 01:40:56.978
-Thanks for coming today, everyone.
-Yes, thank you.


1037
01:40:57.061 --> 01:40:58.728
And here's Mr. Loh Kiwan.

1038
01:40:58.811 --> 01:41:00.895
Oh my goodness. Hello, sir.

1039
01:41:00.978 --> 01:41:03.020
It truly is an honor to meet you,
Ms. Gi Soon.


1040
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:05.561
I've read all your articles.

1041
01:41:05.645 --> 01:41:08.770
Oh, you're too kind.
I still don't know how I get published.


1042
01:41:08.853 --> 01:41:11.395
I love your work.
They made me cry, actually.


1043
01:41:11.478 --> 01:41:14.770
Oh, but I wrote them to make you smile.
You shouldn't cry.


1044
01:41:15.811 --> 01:41:16.895
<i>Come over here.</i>

1045
01:41:18.395 --> 01:41:19.478
I'm busy right now.

1046
01:41:19.978 --> 01:41:22.603
<i>If you knew how much your stunt cost me,</i>
<i>you'd shut your mouth.</i>


1047
01:41:23.353 --> 01:41:25.520
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>you'd get away with it?</i>


1048
01:41:26.103 --> 01:41:28.145
<i>I swear, Marie, this is your last chance.</i>

1049
01:41:29.228 --> 01:41:30.728
<i>Get your ass over here.</i>

1050
01:41:31.728 --> 01:41:34.061
<i>Unless you wanna see a bullet hole</i>
<i>in your lover's skull.</i>


1051
01:41:34.145 --> 01:41:35.228
Oh, my, my.

1052
01:41:36.103 --> 01:41:37.853
Thank you
for everything, comrades.


1053
01:41:40.103 --> 01:41:41.061
Any time.

1054
01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.478
You have endured so much.
You've done well.


1055
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:45.936
Oh, thank you, comrade.

1056
01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.228
-Glad to help.
-Oh.


1057
01:41:48.145 --> 01:41:49.811
Thank you for your support.
I appreciate it.


1058
01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:51.228
We'll always be here.

1059
01:41:52.145 --> 01:41:53.145
-Excuse me.
-Of course.


1060
01:41:53.228 --> 01:41:55.645
I'm really sorry,
but someone is waiting for me.


1061
01:41:56.728 --> 01:41:57.645
What's going on?

1062
01:41:58.228 --> 01:42:00.353
So I forgot
that the plumber was coming by.


1063
01:42:00.436 --> 01:42:01.978
-It seems I have to run home now.
-Oh.


1064
01:42:06.478 --> 01:42:10.353
So promise me you won't worry.
I'll return before the trial ends.


1065
01:42:11.103 --> 01:42:13.311
Okay. Just hurry back when you're done.

1066
01:42:13.395 --> 01:42:14.686
Mm-hmm. I'll be quick.

1067
01:42:17.145 --> 01:42:20.520
But back then,
when they originally broke away from us…


1068
01:42:20.603 --> 01:42:22.686
We gather here today
for the second trial


1069
01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:25.228
in the case between the Kingdom of Belgium

1070
01:42:25.311 --> 01:42:27.478
and Mr. Loh Kiwan.

1071
01:42:27.561 --> 01:42:29.145
This article right here

1072
01:42:29.228 --> 01:42:31.853
was originally published
in a local newspaper in China


1073
01:42:31.936 --> 01:42:35.728
in the small town of Yanji,
on December 5th of last year.


1074
01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.895
It describes the unfortunate death
of a North Korean defector.


1075
01:42:39.978 --> 01:42:42.061
She was struck by a bus
late during the night.


1076
01:42:42.145 --> 01:42:45.103
The accident described
in this newspaper article


1077
01:42:45.186 --> 01:42:47.061
completely corresponds in perfect detail

1078
01:42:47.145 --> 01:42:50.561
with the story Mr. Loh recounted
in his first interview.


1079
01:42:50.645 --> 01:42:54.811
The photo he provided of his mother
is clearly the woman in the paper.


1080
01:42:55.395 --> 01:42:56.520
I now call Loh Kiwan.

1081
01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.520
Can you state your name
for the court, please?


1082
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.936
My name is… Loh Kiwan.

1083
01:43:25.145 --> 01:43:26.561
Don't touch me!

1084
01:43:33.853 --> 01:43:35.561
Give me the conditions
for your next match.


1085
01:43:35.645 --> 01:43:36.645
I'll have my girl ready.

1086
01:43:36.728 --> 01:43:37.770
What's happening?

1087
01:43:50.103 --> 01:43:50.936
No need.

1088
01:43:53.353 --> 01:43:54.561
What do you mean?

1089
01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:55.686
Your girl,

1090
01:43:56.311 --> 01:43:59.186
I don't want her for just… one season.

1091
01:44:00.228 --> 01:44:03.061
The player… for your debt.

1092
01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:08.186
She aimed at "zero," and you are screwed.

1093
01:44:08.686 --> 01:44:12.020
She shouldn't be wasted
at such a small-time shop as this.


1094
01:44:12.936 --> 01:44:14.353
She's out of your league.

1095
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:18.103
That will be better

1096
01:44:19.061 --> 01:44:20.478
for her too.

1097
01:44:24.895 --> 01:44:25.936
Please don't do this.

1098
01:44:41.478 --> 01:44:42.853
You piece of shit.

1099
01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:44.853
It's over for you.

1100
01:44:46.936 --> 01:44:50.436
Mr. Loh
then applied for refugee status


1101
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:54.520
as a North Korean defector
sometime last December.


1102
01:44:54.603 --> 01:44:56.270
As his case was being reviewed,

1103
01:44:56.353 --> 01:44:59.478
he started a new job
but using Chinese papers.


1104
01:44:59.561 --> 01:45:03.895
You'll see the evidence of these acts
on page three of Mr. Loh's case file.


1105
01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:19.811
Mr. Loh, sit down, please.

1106
01:45:19.895 --> 01:45:21.603
Uh, Mr. Loh, what are you doing?

1107
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:26.561
I need to go. Sorry, Mr. Hyeok.

1108
01:45:26.645 --> 01:45:28.395
-Why?
-Marie needs me.


1109
01:45:28.478 --> 01:45:29.520
Mr. Loh, you can't just--

1110
01:45:29.603 --> 01:45:31.353
Sir, sit down, please.
Return to your seat!


1111
01:45:46.103 --> 01:45:47.811
Get the rest of the cash
from the safe.


1112
01:45:48.311 --> 01:45:50.561
-Get armed and ready. They're coming.
-Got it.


1113
01:45:54.061 --> 01:45:55.561
Marie, we've gotta move fast.

1114
01:45:56.853 --> 01:45:58.686
We both need to leave the country
right now.


1115
01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:03.020
-Why would I go with you?
-You're my player. You belong to me.


1116
01:46:04.061 --> 01:46:05.228
We're a pair.

1117
01:46:05.311 --> 01:46:08.228
That means… they'll look for you too.

1118
01:46:08.311 --> 01:46:10.186
His men will be here any minute.

1119
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:12.478
So we need to
get out of this country.

1120
01:46:13.978 --> 01:46:15.020
Listen to me!

1121
01:46:15.603 --> 01:46:16.770
I'm not going with you.

1122
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.728
I don't belong to you!

1123
01:46:19.478 --> 01:46:20.895
You'll be safe with me.

1124
01:46:20.978 --> 01:46:24.395
A place in Amsterdam will take us in.
I've already made the arrangements.


1125
01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:26.478
We can start our own shooting parlor there

1126
01:46:26.561 --> 01:46:28.645
without someone like Gerd
always butting in.


1127
01:46:28.728 --> 01:46:31.270
It'll be different this time.
It's an opportunity.


1128
01:46:31.353 --> 01:46:32.561
You don't have a choice.

1129
01:46:37.311 --> 01:46:38.770
You really are a monster!

1130
01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:43.228
You're right, Marie.
I'm a complete monster.


1131
01:46:44.978 --> 01:46:46.853
But this fucking world made me a monster.

1132
01:46:46.936 --> 01:46:48.061
I can't help it!

1133
01:46:49.145 --> 01:46:50.853
How about I give you
a real taste of it?

1134
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:53.395
Marie!

1135
01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.228
Marie! Marie!

1136
01:46:57.353 --> 01:46:58.436
Marie! Marie!

1137
01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:01.686
Fucking bastard!

1138
01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:03.061
Don't touch him!

1139
01:47:03.145 --> 01:47:04.478
Get off of me!

1140
01:47:04.561 --> 01:47:05.436
Stay down.

1141
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:12.020
Get away from him!

1142
01:47:12.603 --> 01:47:13.811
I said get away!

1143
01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:23.436
Marie.

1144
01:48:17.853 --> 01:48:19.395
What are you waiting for? Come on, huh?

1145
01:48:20.936 --> 01:48:22.020
Don't hesitate.

1146
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:24.353
Just shoot.

1147
01:48:49.145 --> 01:48:50.061
Let's go.

1148
01:48:52.645 --> 01:48:54.311
Marie!

1149
01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.103
Gerd is dead.

1150
01:49:38.061 --> 01:49:39.061
Understood.

1151
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:41.603
I'll get the girl
and bring her to Berlin.

1152
01:49:47.395 --> 01:49:48.603
Where is the girl?

1153
01:49:52.603 --> 01:49:54.061
You can go fuck yourself.

1154
01:50:11.436 --> 01:50:12.645
Marie.

1155
01:50:15.728 --> 01:50:18.728
You're… you're safe. 
Don't worry, okay?

1156
01:50:19.478 --> 01:50:20.436
Huh?

1157
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.603
Marie.

1158
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:34.353
Hear me out. You can't stay here.

1159
01:50:42.978 --> 01:50:44.145
They'll look for you.

1160
01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:50.061
If you want to
be free from those men,

1161
01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.145
leave Belgium forever.

1162
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:56.145
You need to call your dad.

1163
01:50:56.978 --> 01:50:58.728
He'll take you to the airport today.

1164
01:50:59.228 --> 01:51:00.603
And what about you?

1165
01:51:02.311 --> 01:51:04.061
I can't leave without you, Kiwan.

1166
01:51:04.561 --> 01:51:05.436
Huh?

1167
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:09.478
I still don't have citizenship, so, uh…

1168
01:51:12.811 --> 01:51:14.936
I can't come and go
as I please just yet.

1169
01:51:17.395 --> 01:51:18.728
But you already knew that.

1170
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:31.770
All of this is my fault.
I ruined everything.


1171
01:51:37.770 --> 01:51:41.020
We were in such a good place,
and now it's all over.


1172
01:51:48.186 --> 01:51:49.270
That's not true.

1173
01:51:51.895 --> 01:51:53.395
What we have is too strong.

1174
01:51:54.978 --> 01:51:56.395
Nothing can tear us apart.

1175
01:52:04.936 --> 01:52:06.936
Listen, what if I told you…

1176
01:52:10.478 --> 01:52:13.770
the best thing to happen to me
was stealing your wallet, huh?


1177
01:52:16.186 --> 01:52:17.353
When I first met you,

1178
01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.686
I was about ready to give up.

1179
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:23.853
I kept going just
to see your face again.

1180
01:52:27.603 --> 01:52:29.728
But you made me
believe life was worth it.

1181
01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.520
You're the reason I'm still here, Kiwan.

1182
01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:43.270
Your father once said to me…

1183
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:47.853
I wasn't strong enough to be with you.

1184
01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.603
His words were like daggers in my heart.

1185
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:56.895
I felt unworthy of you.

1186
01:53:03.103 --> 01:53:04.811
But that's when I promised myself…

1187
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.895
I would become the person you needed.

1188
01:53:12.811 --> 01:53:14.811
A guy that would
always be there for you.

1189
01:53:18.561 --> 01:53:20.686
So I vowed to prove your father wrong.

1190
01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:24.395
You mean a lot to me, Marie.

1191
01:53:25.686 --> 01:53:26.603
Hmm.

1192
01:53:29.061 --> 01:53:30.270
So someday soon…

1193
01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.853
we'll be together again.

1194
01:53:48.186 --> 01:53:49.103
He's here.

1195
01:54:07.686 --> 01:54:08.728
Hop in the back.

1196
01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.228
Oh, yeah. Uh…

1197
01:54:57.061 --> 01:55:00.103
So, uh, call me as soon as you land
to tell me you're safe.


1198
01:55:07.478 --> 01:55:08.645
Loh Kiwan,

1199
01:55:09.853 --> 01:55:10.811
that young man…

1200
01:55:11.853 --> 01:55:13.520
Turns out he's a special guy.

1201
01:55:15.186 --> 01:55:17.436
Looking back,
I wish I was a little bit nicer.


1202
01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:21.603
Please forgive me.

1203
01:55:28.603 --> 01:55:30.520
There was a time when Mom got worse.

1204
01:55:34.228 --> 01:55:36.478
So she would ring a bell
when she needed help.


1205
01:55:37.186 --> 01:55:38.895
I wanted to ease her pain,

1206
01:55:38.978 --> 01:55:41.395
but at the same time,
I couldn't bear to look at her.


1207
01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.561
So I…

1208
01:55:46.895 --> 01:55:49.603
sometimes wished
she would fall asleep and never wake.


1209
01:55:52.895 --> 01:55:54.353
I felt so guilty for that.

1210
01:55:56.395 --> 01:55:58.686
And though I tried
to hide it, she knew.

1211
01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.603
After she died, um…

1212
01:56:04.103 --> 01:56:06.186
I blamed myself for what happened to her.

1213
01:56:11.603 --> 01:56:13.311
You should have woken me up, huh?

1214
01:56:19.603 --> 01:56:20.686
There you go.

1215
01:56:29.395 --> 01:56:30.395
Please.

1216
01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:33.270
Please let me go.

1217
01:56:36.395 --> 01:56:38.061
I just lie around all day…

1218
01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.728
and wait to die.

1219
01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:44.936
It's unbearable to go on like this.

1220
01:56:47.895 --> 01:56:48.895
I can't go on.

1221
01:56:52.353 --> 01:56:54.311
-Jeong-ju, I, uh--
-My love.


1222
01:56:56.728 --> 01:56:59.645
I'm making you and Marie
miserable each day.


1223
01:57:00.686 --> 01:57:02.686
I don't want to live like this anymore.

1224
01:57:05.353 --> 01:57:07.978
Make sure that Marie
will never know the truth.


1225
01:57:11.561 --> 01:57:14.353
Don't let her know
I chose to leave her like this.


1226
01:57:16.395 --> 01:57:19.311
And promise me that she won't know
you were involved.


1227
01:57:23.978 --> 01:57:25.686
I don't want Marie

1228
01:57:26.895 --> 01:57:28.895
to feel like this was all her fault.

1229
01:57:28.978 --> 01:57:29.936
She can't know.

1230
01:57:32.103 --> 01:57:34.186
Otherwise, it would completely ruin her.

1231
01:57:42.603 --> 01:57:46.145
I'm sorry, and, uh, just know
that, no matter what, I still love you.


1232
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:50.520
I love you.

1233
01:58:05.228 --> 01:58:06.145
You ready?

1234
01:58:08.353 --> 01:58:09.353
Let's get going.

1235
01:58:10.311 --> 01:58:12.770
<i>We kindly request</i>
<i>that you move through screening</i>


1236
01:58:12.853 --> 01:58:16.145
<i>as soon as possible to avoid any delays</i>
<i>in getting to your flight.</i>


1237
01:58:20.311 --> 01:58:21.770
Don't worry about me, Marie.

1238
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:25.311
Just leave and don't look back. Hmm?

1239
01:58:28.228 --> 01:58:30.603
Hey. Don't cry over this.

1240
01:58:31.436 --> 01:58:33.895
Don't worry. Things will work out, okay?

1241
01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.395
You know…

1242
01:58:38.395 --> 01:58:40.603
I still don't even
have a picture of us.

1243
01:58:42.936 --> 01:58:45.020
I didn't get to travel anywhere with you.

1244
01:58:47.186 --> 01:58:49.395
And what if this
really is goodbye for us?

1245
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:02.561
-Marie.
-Hmm?


1246
01:59:03.728 --> 01:59:04.686
One day,

1247
01:59:06.186 --> 01:59:08.020
we'll get to travel anywhere we like.

1248
01:59:08.103 --> 01:59:09.103
Hmm?

1249
01:59:10.895 --> 01:59:11.895
Look over there.

1250
01:59:13.561 --> 01:59:14.520
Turn around.

1251
01:59:19.603 --> 01:59:20.811
Madagascar.

1252
01:59:21.686 --> 01:59:23.270
I will take you there one day.

1253
01:59:24.561 --> 01:59:26.520
And we'll see those trees and turtles.

1254
01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.436
Also,

1255
01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:34.436
we'll go to Greece, Morocco, Turkey.

1256
01:59:36.228 --> 01:59:37.061
Okay?

1257
01:59:38.103 --> 01:59:40.853
We will travel
all over this crazy world together


1258
01:59:42.145 --> 01:59:43.395
till our shoes are worn.

1259
01:59:43.936 --> 01:59:45.603
Yeah, until our feet hurt.

1260
01:59:49.186 --> 01:59:50.186
How's that sound?

1261
01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.436
Hmm?

1262
01:59:56.436 --> 01:59:58.811
Don't cry, Marie, or I'll feel sad, huh?

1263
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:10.270
I love you.

1264
02:00:23.811 --> 02:00:24.728
It's time.

1265
02:01:21.436 --> 02:01:23.936
ONE YEAR LATER

1266
02:01:48.061 --> 02:01:49.561
FROM LOH KIWAN

1267
02:01:55.936 --> 02:01:59.811
<i>I vowed to survive</i>
<i>no matter what hell I faced.</i>


1268
02:02:00.853 --> 02:02:01.770
Christelle Conil?

1269
02:02:01.853 --> 02:02:04.270
<i>It wasn't easy, but I kept my vow.</i>

1270
02:02:04.353 --> 02:02:05.186
Three for lunch?

1271
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:06.186
<i>I've made it this far.</i>

1272
02:02:10.686 --> 02:02:13.228
<i>I fought with everything I had</i>
<i>to gain the right</i>


1273
02:02:13.311 --> 02:02:14.978
<i>to live and work in Belgium,</i>

1274
02:02:16.853 --> 02:02:18.270
<i>and I finally earned</i>

1275
02:02:19.645 --> 02:02:20.645
<i>the right to stay.</i>

1276
02:02:34.853 --> 02:02:36.436
-Thanks for everything
-Thank you.


1277
02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:37.561
We'll miss you.

1278
02:02:38.561 --> 02:02:40.311
<i>But I've come to understand</i>

1279
02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:45.186
<i>that the few rights and protection I have</i>
<i>under refugee status…</i>


1280
02:02:47.478 --> 02:02:51.186
<i>will disappear the moment</i>
<i>that I step off Belgian soil.</i>


1281
02:03:14.895 --> 02:03:16.061
Since you were young,

1282
02:03:17.311 --> 02:03:20.728
I've always believed
that the color blue suited you best.


1283
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:24.186
Comrade, you look great.

1284
02:03:57.936 --> 02:04:01.603
<i>My life has been like a weathering storm,</i>
<i>barely making it out.</i>


1285
02:04:02.145 --> 02:04:03.811
<i>Do I have in me to keep going?</i>

1286
02:04:05.603 --> 02:04:07.853
<i>I asked myself hundreds of times.</i>

1287
02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:10.978
<i>And every time,</i>

1288
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:13.811
<i>I answered,</i>

1289
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:17.478
<i>I'll go through</i>
<i>as many storms as I have to.</i>


1290
02:04:19.353 --> 02:04:21.103
Uh, may I see your ID?

1291
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:29.270
RESIDENCE PERMIT
LOH KIWAN


1292
02:04:33.103 --> 02:04:34.145
Thank you.

1293
02:04:35.478 --> 02:04:36.478
Uh…

1294
02:04:37.686 --> 02:04:39.603
Would you like a round-trip ticket?

1295
02:04:42.103 --> 02:04:42.978
No.

1296
02:04:44.353 --> 02:04:45.436
One way, please.

1297
02:04:46.103 --> 02:04:48.311
<i>In the end, 
I realized my wish was</i>

1298
02:04:49.145 --> 02:04:50.895
<i>never to live in a country but</i>

1299
02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:54.186
<i>the right to leave it whenever I wanted.</i>

1300
02:04:55.770 --> 02:04:58.395
<i>That is still… my wish.</i>

1301
