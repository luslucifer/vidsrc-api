He's trying to get the shoes.

1134
01:10:50.449 --> 01:10:53.159
DANIEL: The fuck you mean Kieth?
Man hell no, man fuck this dude.

Yo, we got to get

01:10:54.787 --> 01:10:56.037
We need to hand that

1137
01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:58.164
No hold up, hold up. Hey, hey hey.

1141
01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.672
You think I did this shit to myself?

1142
01:11:05.673 --> 01:11:07.173
Keith had his boys
beat my ass in broad day...


1143
01:11:07.174 --> 01:11:09.801
What the fuck do you think he's
gonna do with no fucking cops around?


1144
01:11:09.802 --> 01:11:11.761
If we give him the shoes
we lose the fucking store, man.


1145
01:11:11.762 --> 01:11:12.845
Yo, fuck that store, dawg.
