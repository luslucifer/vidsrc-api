00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:55.854
Next stop:

2
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.437
Stadtallendorf, 
Vltava Street.

3
00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.437
Hello! - Good morning!
- Hello!


4
00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.395
Anything else?
- No, thanks.


5
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.521
Here you are. One Euro please.

6
00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:02.896
Ilknur was talking so we're
all going back outside.


7
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.854
We can practice it again.
No problem.


8
00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:07.854
Everyone outside.

9
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.604
I'll call you.

10
00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:16.354
Everything okay, Ferhan?

11
00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:18.646
Everything alright?

12
00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.354
2nd try.

13
00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:53.562
Who's missing?
- Ronja.


14
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.270
That's it?

15
00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:56.687
Stefi.

16
00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.604
Stefi's downstairs.
- Downstairs?


17
00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.938
Can you go get her?

18
00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:11.354
That's everyone, right?

19
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.604
Or is anyone else missing?

20
00:05:15.354 --> 00:05:17.103
So everyone's here. Good.

21
00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:19.479
Let's wait a minute.

22
00:05:19.854 --> 00:05:21.521
Are you still tired?

23
00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.229
Who's tired?

24
00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:26.812
Let's take a dive for a few minutes.

25
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:38.020
Good morning, Stefi!

26
00:05:38.562 --> 00:05:40.521
Hasan's missing, too.

27
00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:42.771
Yeah, Hasan?
- Where's Hasan?


28
00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:45.229
Where should I sit?
- Did you see him outside?


29
00:05:45.354 --> 00:05:46.354
Nope.

30
00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:48.354
Okay.

31
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:52.479
Where should I sit?
- Anywhere you want.


32
00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.062
Mr. Bachmann and His Class

33
00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:16.854
It had such a sound that no
one stayed in their chair.


34
00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:19.646
Can you imagine that, Mattia?

35
00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:23.187
Good morning, Mattia!
- What did the guitar look like?


36
00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.312
Stefi, what did the guitar look like?
What color was it?


37
00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.896
Gold.
- Yeah...


38
00:06:32.103 --> 00:06:34.646
Hasan, can you translate
that for her? Black.


39
00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:36.979
I understood it.
- You understood it?


40
00:06:37.103 --> 00:06:40.479
So the table was in love
with this electric guitar,


41
00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:46.062
and could care less about the battered,
old, red guitar over there.


42
00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:51.687
I'm telling you, when the guitar played,
it suddenly stood on one leg,


43
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.395
and spun around in circles
and really rocked out.


44
00:06:56.687 --> 00:07:01.062
Hasan's laughing, but I'm
telling you, it tried everything


45
00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:04.729
to somehow get the guitar's attention.

46
00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:09.270
The table was really frustrated.

47
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.604
What does "frustrated" mean, Regina?

48
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.771
Who knows what "frustrated" means?

49
00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:18.062
I think, for example,

50
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:22.729
when you put something outside in the cold.

51
00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:25.270
Then it gets frosted. 
It gets really cold.

52
00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:27.062
You mean "frosted".
- Yes.


53
00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:29.521
No. "Frustrated" comes from "frustration".

54
00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:32.938
Like when someone's in a
really bad mood and annoyed.


55
00:07:33.062 --> 00:07:34.729
Just a bad mood.

56
00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:37.562
Who's in a bad mood?

57
00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:41.020
The table.
- The table?


58
00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:43.354
Why's the table in a bad mood?

59
00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:47.020
Because the guitar didn't see it,

60
00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:49.771
didn't notice it.
- Exactly.


61
00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.437
Then it decides to play the lottery.

62
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.604
The table wins the lottery,

63
00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:58.395
cracks the jackpot,

64
00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:00.062
wins 12 million Euros.

65
00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:02.562
Then what happens?

66
00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:05.312
I think the table won.

67
00:08:05.687 --> 00:08:08.771
And then because the table was rich,

68
00:08:08.896 --> 00:08:11.771
the guitar, the black one,

69
00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:15.020
got interested in the table.

70
00:08:15.145 --> 00:08:17.229
They agreed to meet in secret.

71
00:08:17.562 --> 00:08:20.229
At night, when no one was at school.

72
00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:23.938
At night, when everything's dark here.

73
00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:29.437
Maybe the guitar just used the table
because it had so much money.


74
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.854
That's all I can do.

75
00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:35.270
Then what could a table

76
00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:40.187
give an electric guitar
to impress it even more?


77
00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.437
Flowers?

78
00:08:42.646 --> 00:08:44.270
Thea Lucia?
- Flowers.


79
00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:49.020
What's an electric guitar supposed
to do with flowers, Thea Lucia?


80
00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.521
You mean painted onto it?

81
00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:53.395
Here's a guitar.
Can you paint some flowers on it?


82
00:08:53.687 --> 00:08:55.979
What else does a guitar need?

83
00:08:56.354 --> 00:08:57.896
Jamie.
- An Amp.


84
00:08:58.062 --> 00:08:59.479
Huh?
- An amp. - Yeah.


85
00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:03.896
Yeah, a really big, cool tube amp.

86
00:09:04.646 --> 00:09:07.771
A really big one
that makes lots of noise.

87
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.979
Great idea, Jamie.

88
00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:12.270
Yes?
- New guitar strings.


89
00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:18.062
That's exactly what the
table gave the guitar.


90
00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:20.145
Real...

91
00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:23.312
killer AC/DC...

92
00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:27.437
strings,

93
00:09:27.604 --> 00:09:31.646
that make a totally killer
sound, glitter, scream.


94
00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:34.229
They scream when you play them.

95
00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:36.562
Really.
- Uh-huh.


96
00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:40.812
Of course, the guitar was happy,
but still not satisfied.


97
00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:43.354
The table got more and more desperate.

98
00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:46.145
What did it give it the next day?

99
00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:49.020
Tim, you've got a guitar.

100
00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:53.312
I don't...

101
00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:57.479
How do you store it?

102
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:03.562
I don't know.

103
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:07.062
You keep it in the cellar, huh?
- No.


104
00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:10.312
What do you do with your guitar
when you're not playing it?


105
00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:12.562
Put it on a stand.
- Right!


106
00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:15.729
So how about a stand?

107
00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:19.979
Yes. - What kind of "stand"
[slang "hard-on"] have you got?


108
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.646
To set it in.

109
00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:28.562
Like this but a single one?
- Yeah.


110
00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:31.020
Alright, that was the point.

111
00:10:32.687 --> 00:10:38.103
The guitar doesn't just get
any old "stand" ["hard-on"].


112
00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:45.812
But one with diamonds and rubies and such.

113
00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:49.479
Come on, Hasan, the whole hog!

114
00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:51.437
Hasan's going like this.

115
00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:55.729
Hey, anyone know what a "gig bag" is?
- What?


116
00:10:56.187 --> 00:10:59.896
The table also gave the guitar
a gig bag, a guitar bag.


117
00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:03.229
What do think it looked like?

118
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:06.145
No.
- Then what did it look like?


119
00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:09.354
No idea.

120
00:11:09.604 --> 00:11:11.062
Guess.

121
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.604
Mattia:

122
00:11:13.729 --> 00:11:16.395
It said on it, "Io ti amo Mattia".
- No, no, no...


123
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:18.354
What's that mean? Translate it.

124
00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:20.854
I love you.

125
00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:23.229
And in Turkish, Ilknur?

126
00:11:23.562 --> 00:11:26.229
Seni seviyorum.

127
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:28.020
Seni seviyorum.

128
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.354
That was written on it too.

129
00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:32.979
And in Russian?
- "Ya tebya lyublyu."


130
00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:35.020
Say it again a bit slower.

131
00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:37.062
Ya tebya lyublyu.

132
00:11:37.187 --> 00:11:38.729
Oh, I can't repeat that one.

133
00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:41.270
Hasan, in Bulgarian!

134
00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:42.562
She can say it.

135
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:43.896
Obicham te.

136
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.938
I love you in Bulgarian?
- That's what she said.


137
00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:48.646
Again.
- "Obicham te."


138
00:11:48.854 --> 00:11:52.229
The table had had enough.
Can you imagine this, Ilknur?


139
00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:56.812
It keeps giving this stupid guitar
everything you can think of.


140
00:11:57.103 --> 00:12:00.479
And at some point during
the night the drums,


141
00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:04.437
they jam sometimes at night.
What's "jammin'" mean, Ayman?


142
00:12:04.562 --> 00:12:09.479
When it's windy,
the drums make sounds on their own.


143
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.646
Well, you've got a vivid imagination,
but what does "jammin'" mean?


144
00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:15.395
Play.
- Play.


145
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.354
Improvise, like we do sometimes. Okay.

146
00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:21.020
During the night,
the drums said to the table:


147
00:12:21.145 --> 00:12:24.020
You're an idiot. 
You're getting screwed.

148
00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:26.020
Those drums.

149
00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.979
How do drums talk, Hasan?

150
00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:31.896
Asshole!

151
00:12:33.729 --> 00:12:34.938
Asshole!

152
00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:38.103
Gettin' screwed.

153
00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:42.854
Then the hi-hat kicks in:

154
00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:45.896
Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!
Gotta stop it!


155
00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:49.938
Play "Gotta stop it!" and
I'll play the other part.


156
00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:52.979
You have to say, "Gotta stop it!".
- Gotta stop it! ugh!


157
00:12:53.103 --> 00:12:56.354
Come on! "Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!"
The 8th note... come on!


158
00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:59.604
Huh? What?
- "Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!"


159
00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.395
Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!
- Keep going.


160
00:13:02.562 --> 00:13:04.187
Come on!
- No.


161
00:13:04.437 --> 00:13:06.896
Ayman? "Gotta stop it! 
Gotta stop it!"

162
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.187
Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!
It's too hard. - Keep going!


163
00:13:10.312 --> 00:13:13.145
Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!
Gotta stop it!


164
00:13:13.312 --> 00:13:16.604
Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!
Gotta stop it!


165
00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:19.938
Gettin' screwed! Gettin' screwed!
- Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it!


166
00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:23.270
Got it? That's how they
talked to each other.


167
00:13:26.354 --> 00:13:32.187
Ilknur, could you get anything out
of the story where you'd say:


168
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:37.062
Come on, table and guitar?
What rubbish! Fake.


169
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:43.187
But maybe there's something
in the story that speaks to you.


170
00:13:43.938 --> 00:13:45.145
Thea Lucia?

171
00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:52.395
If these were people and someone said:
This guitar is taking advantage of you.


172
00:13:54.103 --> 00:13:59.270
That's somehow understandable.
It happens in lots of relationships.


173
00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:02.479
Right. Carolin?

174
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:04.896
That the story

175
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.312
is almost like in real life.

176
00:14:09.687 --> 00:14:11.896
That...

177
00:14:12.812 --> 00:14:17.687
some people don't
really think about things,


178
00:14:17.854 --> 00:14:21.312
but are corrupted instead.

179
00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:25.729
Yes. Beauty, money,

180
00:14:26.062 --> 00:14:27.395
appearances.

181
00:14:27.812 --> 00:14:29.812
I couldn't say it any better.

182
00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.812
I'm finished.

183
00:14:32.687 --> 00:14:33.896
I'm coming.

184
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.062
Are we going to play any music today?
- Yes.


185
00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:46.020
But we have only 15 minutes left.

186
00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:48.145
We've got two more hours.
- No.


187
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.938
Yes. I've taken over biology.
We don't have biology today.


188
00:14:52.062 --> 00:14:56.103
Then I don't have the German course.
- You don't have the German course.


189
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.437
Yeah, I do today.
- No, you're staying here.


190
00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:08.687
Okay. Good. That's it.

191
00:15:09.103 --> 00:15:10.979
Recess.

192
00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.062
Bye, Mr. Bachmann!

193
00:15:13.354 --> 00:15:14.562
Recess!

194
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:16.395
Get outta here!

195
00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:27.062
With milk, okay.

196
00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:30.229
No sugar. How much is it?

197
00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:32.896
I think €1.20.

198
00:15:33.604 --> 00:15:35.604
Or €1.30.

199
00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:40.020
Then bring me a roll with
mozzarella or something.


200
00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:47.020
No one's from Izmir but
you still wrote Izmir.


201
00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:51.354
My relatives live there, but you
didn't know that before.


202
00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:53.687
Oh, Denizli. That's where I'm from.

203
00:15:53.812 --> 00:15:55.103
How sweet!

204
00:15:57.145 --> 00:15:58.979
We need a pot.

205
00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:05.771
Ms. Bal, have we got any...
- Wait, I've got an idea.


206
00:16:06.938 --> 00:16:09.187
Have we got anything to put on?

207
00:16:09.354 --> 00:16:11.187
Aprons? Yes.

208
00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:17.395
Here. Take one.

209
00:16:23.646 --> 00:16:24.938
What do you bake?

210
00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.521
No idea. Whatever my mom makes.

211
00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.604
She tells you what to make?
- Yes.


212
00:16:29.729 --> 00:16:32.229
So you help her in the kitchen?
- Yes.


213
00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:36.187
I like that. And what about the cleaning?

214
00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:37.938
Cleaning up?

215
00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:39.437
No.
- Not that?


216
00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:40.979
Why not?

217
00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:43.312
It's women's work, right?

218
00:16:46.354 --> 00:16:50.604
But today you're going to help clean
up, right? - We'll see.


219
00:16:51.103 --> 00:16:54.812
Who has an idea what
celebrating with parents means?


220
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:59.521
Juggling with your little sister?
- No, let's play music.


221
00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:03.521
We could do that.
- Like "Jingle Bells" or "Shalom Shalom".


222
00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:06.687
So singing for your parents?
- Right, Mr. Bachmann.


223
00:17:06.812 --> 00:17:08.771
Show off a bit for them.

224
00:17:08.896 --> 00:17:12.646
I'd like to see your little sister.
She's new here. I haven't met her yet.


225
00:17:12.896 --> 00:17:15.145
She'll be there, Mr. Bachmann.
- Really?


226
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.145
She's going to dance... belly dance.
- And your mom's coming, right?


227
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.437
So, Ayman?

228
00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:23.771
My father works and my mother has
to take care of my little sister.


229
00:17:23.938 --> 00:17:28.354
She can bring your little sister with her.
- I know, but she has to work too.


230
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:31.187
You just made that up.
- No, I swear.


231
00:17:31.354 --> 00:17:35.854
Ilknur?
- My mother has to work.


232
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.437
My father has late-shift but my
brothers and sisters can come.


233
00:17:39.562 --> 00:17:42.103
All of them?
- Nope.


234
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.437
Everyone?

235
00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:45.604
How many?
- Half of them.


236
00:17:45.854 --> 00:17:48.729
I mean how many if they all come?

237
00:17:48.938 --> 00:17:51.604
Four.
- And you make 5?


238
00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:54.687
That'd be great.
- There's 5 of us too, Mr. Bachmann!


239
00:17:54.812 --> 00:17:58.729
Five of you?
We could start a whole new class.


240
00:17:58.854 --> 00:18:01.437
1, 2, 3, 4, and with Cengizhan 5.

241
00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:05.521
Only boy, only boy, Mr. Bachmann!
- You're the only boy? - Yeah.


242
00:18:05.646 --> 00:18:08.938
Rabia?
- My mother's going somewhere tomorrow.


243
00:18:09.103 --> 00:18:13.312
I forgot where. 
Somewhere for work.

244
00:18:13.521 --> 00:18:17.437
My father... my father's not here.

245
00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:20.646
My father's divorced. 
He's in Kirchhain.

246
00:18:20.771 --> 00:18:22.938
Your father's not here?

247
00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.062
He's in Kirchhain, working.

248
00:18:26.229 --> 00:18:28.604
And you can't invite him?
- No.


249
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:32.020
So your parents don't live together?
- Right.


250
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:35.604
It'd still be nice if your
father could come. - Yeah!


251
00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:37.896
We'd all be happy.
- Yeah!


252
00:18:38.062 --> 00:18:39.812
You, too, right?

253
00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:41.854
Give it a try. Invite him.

254
00:18:41.979 --> 00:18:42.979
Regina?

255
00:18:43.103 --> 00:18:46.521
My father has late shift and
my mother doesn't have time.


256
00:18:46.687 --> 00:18:48.270
That's a shame.

257
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:51.812
Yes?
- I forgot that...


258
00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:56.395
my brother's at Amöneburg and can't come.

259
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.479
Thank God we know this!

260
00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:01.437
Erdzhan, are you coming tomorrow?

261
00:19:01.562 --> 00:19:04.395
Yes.
- I wanted to give you an extra thanks...


262
00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:06.979
- Why?
- For always laughing so nicely.


263
00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:09.771
Even when I see
you on the school yard.

264
00:19:09.938 --> 00:19:13.229
You have a great laugh.
It makes me feel really good.


265
00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:15.395
I just had to tell you.

266
00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:22.896
How 'bout some more schoolwork?

267
00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.270
No!

268
00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:27.521
Okay, then let's do today's highlights.

269
00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:28.896
Ayman?

270
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:35.604
Today was good because we
had music instead of lessons.


271
00:19:35.854 --> 00:19:39.145
What did we do during the first lesson?

272
00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.812
We had only one hour of classes,

273
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.562
and cooking was good.

274
00:19:44.687 --> 00:19:47.354
And you gave me these sticks.

275
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:51.646
You've been clinging to them all day.
I had to give them to you,


276
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:53.437
or there'd be an accident.

277
00:19:53.562 --> 00:19:57.646
But, Ayman, they're not for beating on
your little brothers and sisters.


278
00:19:57.771 --> 00:19:58.771
I know.

279
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.979
I can give you
only a 'C' in Math.

280
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:58.646
We'll have to try to bump you up a level.
Then I can send you to secondary school.


281
00:21:58.812 --> 00:22:03.103
It'd be a shame if you went to
the lower secondary school.


282
00:22:03.229 --> 00:22:05.938
No, I want to go to secondary school.

283
00:22:06.062 --> 00:22:09.646
Me, too, but you've got
to do something for it.


284
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.020
We've got to do two things:

285
00:22:12.145 --> 00:22:15.896
Prepare really well for the math tests.

286
00:22:19.521 --> 00:22:24.020
And in German you have to
read more. Do you understand?


287
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.521
They'll throw you out of secondary
school if you can't read.


288
00:22:31.062 --> 00:22:32.812
Are you sure you understand?

289
00:22:33.062 --> 00:22:37.729
We can do it. We've got
six more months. Six months.


290
00:22:37.938 --> 00:22:41.479
We have a social studies test
today. I had my books... - When?


291
00:22:41.646 --> 00:22:43.479
I think today?
- Which period?


292
00:22:43.604 --> 00:22:47.145
I think 3rd or 4th or 7th or 8th.
- You have biology 3rd and 4th.


293
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:52.229
Then maybe 7th or 8th,
but I forgot my stuff on Friday.


294
00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:54.854
Then we can still practice today.

295
00:22:57.354 --> 00:23:00.229
Maybe you should cut back on sports.

296
00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:02.187
I have to.

297
00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:07.979
But I won twice.
- Really?


298
00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:10.646
Which sport?
- Boxing.


299
00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:12.354
Normal boxing?
- Yes.


300
00:23:12.479 --> 00:23:14.020
Classical boxing?
- Right.


301
00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:16.938
I'd probably like that job, too.

302
00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:21.020
But I'm probably too old and would
get knocked down all the time.


303
00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:24.687
So, mate, huh...

304
00:23:24.812 --> 00:23:27.270
When it's reading time,
sit down with a book,


305
00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:29.354
and we can practice together.

306
00:23:29.604 --> 00:23:32.562
You have to remember. 
That's your job.

307
00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:35.562
Or I'll knock you out!

308
00:23:37.437 --> 00:23:41.771
So all the gangsters are
sitting in the back row.


309
00:23:41.896 --> 00:23:45.896
I have to admit,
I did the same when I was in school.


310
00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:50.229
Take a seat, Ferhan.

311
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.812
Are you leaving again?

312
00:24:01.687 --> 00:24:02.729
Good morning.

313
00:24:02.938 --> 00:24:05.938
Good morning, Mr. Bachmann.

314
00:24:06.646 --> 00:24:10.229
Who remembers what we were doing?

315
00:24:10.437 --> 00:24:13.938
What did we just start in math?

316
00:24:15.562 --> 00:24:18.437
Luck? Chance?

317
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:21.854
And our 3rd nice term is "probability".

318
00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:23.437
The question-

319
00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.103
Ayman, this is a warning.

320
00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:28.103
Which rule did you break?

321
00:24:28.229 --> 00:24:30.604
Didn't raise my hand.
- Do it next time. Okay.


322
00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:32.103
Ayman?

323
00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:34.938
I'm going to mark two balls.

324
00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:42.103
And now's the question: Who's lucky?

325
00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:44.729
It's all about luck, right?

326
00:24:44.854 --> 00:24:47.062
I'll mix them up.

327
00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:01.979
All the boys have taken a ball,

328
00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:06.062
and not a single one of
them got a marked ball.


329
00:25:07.812 --> 00:25:10.354
Any comments?

330
00:25:14.187 --> 00:25:18.562
Hasan, what do you think?
- No idea. He's unlucky.


331
00:25:23.145 --> 00:25:25.562
Who's unlucky?
- Ayman.


332
00:25:25.687 --> 00:25:26.938
Ayman's unlucky.

333
00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:31.896
And now, everyone, if Jamie
had been able to take a ball,


334
00:25:32.604 --> 00:25:37.771
Jamie might have gotten this ball
right away. That's what we call luck.


335
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.938
Pure luck.

336
00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:44.646
But the probability of him getting one

337
00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:49.020
is less than for Thea Lucia.

338
00:25:49.145 --> 00:25:51.395
Does everyone understand?

339
00:25:51.896 --> 00:25:53.646
There's a formula for luck.

340
00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:58.604
Mathematicians say you can calculate luck.

341
00:26:08.646 --> 00:26:12.020
You can sit on the tables.
You can sit on the sofa.


342
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.312
You can sit under the table
like you used to do, Niklas.


343
00:26:15.437 --> 00:26:18.062
In "reading hell".
- Yeah, in "reading hell".


344
00:26:27.062 --> 00:26:29.979
Hasan, we discussed this yesterday.
- What?


345
00:26:30.145 --> 00:26:33.604
How important reading is.
- Yeah.


346
00:27:12.312 --> 00:27:16.103
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.
I wouldn't know what to do.


347
00:27:16.229 --> 00:27:19.896
I'd be devastated. This is my home.
Where else could I go?


348
00:27:20.187 --> 00:27:23.312
It'd be the same in Turkey.
I've got family there too.


349
00:27:23.771 --> 00:27:26.771
But my kids are my real family.

350
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:29.395
And it's tough not
having my kids with me.

351
00:27:29.938 --> 00:27:33.103
I've got two kids: Lina and Oskar.

352
00:27:33.604 --> 00:27:36.437
And if suddenly someone
said to me: Herr Cavdar,


353
00:27:36.562 --> 00:27:39.562
because of your opinions or your origin,

354
00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:41.854
my parents are from Turkey,

355
00:27:41.979 --> 00:27:44.395
you may no longer stay here.
Or I have to flee.


356
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:46.479
I'd be extremely unhappy.

357
00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:48.604
It would be an absolute disaster.

358
00:27:50.854 --> 00:27:53.896
Give it some thought. 
I have a list here.

359
00:27:54.312 --> 00:27:56.395
Which things would you take with you?

360
00:27:57.354 --> 00:28:01.229
We're traveling to Turkey but I'll
tell you why we're going to Turkey.


361
00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:05.562
Dad said: because you can...

362
00:28:12.395 --> 00:28:15.395
Fleeing

363
00:28:16.812 --> 00:28:18.854
Fleeing

364
00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:22.771
We're having a fire drill and you're
the only class still in the building.


365
00:28:22.896 --> 00:28:25.187
Is this a drill
or is it for real?

366
00:28:25.312 --> 00:28:28.687
I don't know but everyone
has to leave the building.


367
00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:30.854
I didn't hear anything.

368
00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:33.103
What's that mean?

369
00:28:33.395 --> 00:28:35.479
Okay, everyone outside.

370
00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:38.687
Slowly. Stay calm.

371
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.020
Take it easy.
We'll head over to the playing field.


372
00:28:53.062 --> 00:28:54.479
I was born in Morocco.

373
00:28:54.687 --> 00:28:58.062
I was there for two years,
then we went to Italy.


374
00:28:58.187 --> 00:29:00.395
I was there for five years.

375
00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:02.395
Then we came here.

376
00:29:02.604 --> 00:29:07.062
That means-
- I've been here 5 1/2 years.


377
00:29:07.395 --> 00:29:11.354
So you were in Morocco
for the shortest amount of time?


378
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:14.395
But still you say: That's my homeland.

379
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.229
Even though you were there only 2 years.

380
00:29:17.437 --> 00:29:20.229
Why, Ayman? Can anyone explain this?

381
00:29:24.687 --> 00:29:25.771
Ayman?

382
00:29:28.062 --> 00:29:32.062
You miss your family because you
haven't seen them for a long time.


383
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:38.020
We go every year, but now we
haven't been there for two years.


384
00:29:38.354 --> 00:29:41.145
So I really miss them a lot now.

385
00:30:03.646 --> 00:30:06.646
I'm pregnant.

386
00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:08.729
That's why I'm so sensitive.

387
00:30:09.103 --> 00:30:10.270
Why?

388
00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:14.979
Okay.

389
00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:17.854
Cengizhan, what's it like for you?

390
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.312
For me?

391
00:30:19.562 --> 00:30:22.687
Your family's here but your
relatives are in Turkey?


392
00:30:22.812 --> 00:30:23.854
No, here.

393
00:30:23.979 --> 00:30:26.312
Also here? Lots of them?
- Everyone.


394
00:30:26.437 --> 00:30:32.187
So according to this theory,
you must feel at home here.


395
00:30:32.354 --> 00:30:33.979
No.
- Is this your homeland?


396
00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:37.229
No.
- Why not?


397
00:30:37.687 --> 00:30:39.521
Because I'm Turkish.

398
00:30:39.979 --> 00:30:44.229
I feel comfortable in Germany because
there's no war or anything.


399
00:30:44.562 --> 00:30:47.854
But when I'm grown up I
want to live in Turkey.


400
00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:51.854
With Hasan.

401
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.729
Hasan in Bulgaria.
- And in Bulgaria, Hasan?


402
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.187
You don't want to go there?
- Yes, I do.


403
00:30:58.729 --> 00:31:03.854
I want to go there because
I've missed so much.


404
00:31:04.771 --> 00:31:08.020
Ilknur, where do you feel more at home?
Here or there?


405
00:31:09.354 --> 00:31:12.812
Turkey.
- Turkey. Why Ilknur?


406
00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:15.938
Because my grandpa's grave is there.

407
00:31:16.854 --> 00:31:20.145
Okay, we can't move it to here.

408
00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:23.270
Cengizhan?
- Ms. Bal, 'cause of the people too.


409
00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:25.854
I don't know.

410
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:28.896
It's hard to say, huh?
- Yes.


411
00:31:29.312 --> 00:31:32.521
But it's okay to say it.
- What?


412
00:31:32.896 --> 00:31:35.896
No insults, then-
- They're way better there.


413
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:39.729
They're Turks and I'm Turkish. That's why.

414
00:31:39.938 --> 00:31:43.479
Lots of people here in
Stadtallendorf have Turkish roots.


415
00:31:43.646 --> 00:31:45.604
That's true, isn't it?

416
00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:48.354
He says that because in Turkey

417
00:31:48.812 --> 00:31:51.646
it's different.

418
00:31:52.062 --> 00:31:53.812
They're totally different Turks.

419
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.062
Not like the ones here.

420
00:31:57.687 --> 00:32:00.687
How do you say 'homeland' in Turkish?

421
00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:02.729
Homeland.'

422
00:32:03.103 --> 00:32:07.229
Ilknur?
- I can't remember.


423
00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:10.479
How do you say it in Turkish?

424
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:14.896
Ilknur, you said you
feel at home in Turkey.


425
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.979
But you don't know what 'homeland'
is in Turkish? - 'Vatan!'


426
00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:21.437
Enough! Next time raise your hand.

427
00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:23.854
Cengizhan?
- 'Vatan.'


428
00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:25.979
Right. It's 'vatan' in Turkish.

429
00:32:26.729 --> 00:32:29.020
I felt the same way at your age.

430
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.395
I was born and raised here.

431
00:32:33.646 --> 00:32:35.270
Like lots of you.

432
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.312
And I often felt like a stranger
here when I was your age.


433
00:32:40.437 --> 00:32:43.354
But I didn't always feel
at home in Turkey either.


434
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:47.896
That's why I always wondered:
Where do I belong?


435
00:32:48.562 --> 00:32:51.020
You've been in Germany over 30 years?

436
00:32:51.229 --> 00:32:54.020
35 years to be exact.

437
00:32:54.854 --> 00:32:57.896
You can use colored pencils, Cengizhan.
It's faster.


438
00:32:58.229 --> 00:33:01.395
Ms. Bal, is Hannover nice?
- Hannover? - Yes.


439
00:33:01.687 --> 00:33:04.187
Let me think. Yes.

440
00:33:04.437 --> 00:33:07.437
Ms. Bal, Stefi and Hasan love you,

441
00:33:07.604 --> 00:33:09.604
but don't want to admit it.

442
00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:12.103
You idiot!
- Love is beautiful.


443
00:33:37.395 --> 00:33:40.979
The beginning's not like this.

444
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:45.729
And then whew! But together
it's called an "entré", a beginning.


445
00:33:46.938 --> 00:33:48.145
Got it?

446
00:34:02.854 --> 00:34:07.395
Shalom! Shalom!

447
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:09.729
Great! You're already hitting the note.

448
00:34:09.854 --> 00:34:12.437
Shalom chaverim!

449
00:34:12.562 --> 00:34:17.312
Stop! Your voice is already hitting E minor
even with all the noise around here.


450
00:34:17.437 --> 00:34:19.812
You're really talented. I mean it!

451
00:34:19.938 --> 00:34:22.437
Sing it again. 
You hit the note spot on.

452
00:34:22.646 --> 00:34:24.270
Heigh ho!

453
00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.646
Exactly!

454
00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:27.896
Hitch up the cart,

455
00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.062
Since the wind drives rain across the land,

456
00:34:32.187 --> 00:34:34.562
Fetch the golden sheaves,

457
00:34:34.896 --> 00:34:37.312
Fetch the golden sheaves,

458
00:34:37.646 --> 00:34:41.812
Heigh ho! Hitch up the cart,

459
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.979
Since the wind drives rain across the land.

460
00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:50.604
Fetch the golden sheaves,

461
00:34:50.729 --> 00:34:53.938
Heigh ho! Hitch up the cart...

462
00:35:51.979 --> 00:35:53.354
Stay seated!

463
00:36:23.437 --> 00:36:26.604
Last one, right?
- This is really annoying...


464
00:36:26.729 --> 00:36:28.187
Last one?
- Yeah.


465
00:36:28.312 --> 00:36:31.270
All this grading's really stressing me out.

466
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:34.020
Have I got everyone here?

467
00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:36.395
I'll check my list.

468
00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:38.479
Dieter!

469
00:36:41.229 --> 00:36:42.687
Want some help?

470
00:36:54.395 --> 00:36:56.395
He's got an 'F' in English?
- Yeah.


471
00:36:56.604 --> 00:36:59.312
A or B course?

472
00:36:59.437 --> 00:37:02.062
I think B.

473
00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:05.103
We don't really need to discuss this.

474
00:37:05.229 --> 00:37:07.729
Yes, we need to discuss the F's.

475
00:37:07.979 --> 00:37:10.354
But this isn't a C course.

476
00:37:10.604 --> 00:37:12.979
We have to see if it balances out.

477
00:37:13.103 --> 00:37:15.270
We can mark it here.

478
00:37:15.771 --> 00:37:17.521
Now for our strategy:

479
00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:21.646
I think Hasan's clear, right?
We'll get him into secondary school.


480
00:37:21.854 --> 00:37:23.979
His was a clear case.
- Yes.


481
00:37:24.103 --> 00:37:25.896
And Mattia, of course.
- Yes.


482
00:37:26.103 --> 00:37:31.145
As for Stefi,
I'd argue that she's making progress.


483
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.312
She works really hard, she's intelligent.

484
00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:41.771
But she's really struggling
with learning German. - I know.


485
00:37:42.354 --> 00:37:44.771
Because they don't speak
any German at home.


486
00:37:44.979 --> 00:37:48.103
I don't see Stefi in the
lower secondary school class.


487
00:37:50.312 --> 00:37:52.103
But I'm a little upset with Hasan

488
00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:54.687
and Stefi, I have to say.

489
00:37:55.187 --> 00:37:57.479
They haven't done much lately.

490
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.521
But I'd... you know how it is.

491
00:38:03.854 --> 00:38:06.020
Stefi's a whirlwind.

492
00:38:07.479 --> 00:38:10.187
But when I think about
where she was 6 months ago,


493
00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:13.312
she didn't speak a single word of German.

494
00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:15.479
And-
- [OFF] What about 5b?


495
00:38:15.938 --> 00:38:19.604
She'd act like she understood you.

496
00:38:20.312 --> 00:38:24.771
But now she asks when she
doesn't understand something.


497
00:38:24.938 --> 00:38:28.270
I'm also in favor of putting
her in a higher level.


498
00:38:28.395 --> 00:38:33.479
But I don't want her to fall short
and feel disappointed.


499
00:38:33.687 --> 00:38:35.020
Of course not.

500
00:38:35.145 --> 00:38:39.521
But I'm telling you Stefi will
be there 6 months from now.


501
00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:42.229
I know she's not there yet,

502
00:38:42.354 --> 00:38:45.187
but she'll be there
in 6 months for sure.

503
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:22.020
And what if we make a recommendation
and the parents totally disagree?


504
00:39:22.145 --> 00:39:25.562
It's a process. 
For now, you can-

505
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.729
We'll send out a letter that says,

506
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.395
for example: We recommend
that your daughter Ronja


507
00:39:34.604 --> 00:39:37.062
attends our secondary school here.

508
00:39:37.187 --> 00:39:41.896
The parents can lodge an appeal
and say: We disagree.


509
00:39:42.103 --> 00:39:46.395
We want Ronja to
be sent to high school.

510
00:39:46.521 --> 00:39:48.145
Then we'd have to do it.

511
00:39:48.354 --> 00:39:51.229
We can skip one level but not two.

512
00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:54.979
But the point is:

513
00:39:55.521 --> 00:39:58.095
The next conference is in 6 weeks,

514
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.962
and the parents will no longer
have the power to veto.


515
00:40:01.521 --> 00:40:03.479
This means six weeks later,

516
00:40:04.312 --> 00:40:09.938
only the teachers can decide on
the allocation of school branches.


517
00:40:10.103 --> 00:40:14.354
So if in 6 weeks the grades are-
- if the grades aren't any better


518
00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:17.354
she'd get the same placement.

519
00:40:17.562 --> 00:40:23.145
It wouldn't be final yet. The final
ranking comes after Easter break.


520
00:40:24.145 --> 00:40:29.062
Which basically doesn't change on their
report cards, at least not that I've ever seen.


521
00:40:30.687 --> 00:40:34.854
I thought such a conference
would take longer,


522
00:40:34.979 --> 00:40:37.687
where it's-
- a matter of life and death.


523
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:38.979
Yeah, it's important.

524
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.145
Let's pull up this table, Hasan.

525
00:42:21.979 --> 00:42:23.687
She was sick, wasn't she?

526
00:42:23.812 --> 00:42:25.812
What?
- She was sick.


527
00:42:25.979 --> 00:42:27.687
A little, but she's fine now.

528
00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:34.270
Ayman asks if your mother wants tea.

529
00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:37.521
Yes.
- With sugar?


530
00:42:37.646 --> 00:42:40.229
Are you sure she doesn't speak French?
- Yes.


531
00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:41.979
Sure?
- How much sugar, Ayman?


532
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:46.646
Ah, she's afraid of me.

533
00:42:47.854 --> 00:42:48.979
Mr. Bachmann,

534
00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:52.479
my big brother taught
me how to play drums.

535
00:42:52.729 --> 00:42:55.771
Showed you and then on the table?
- Yes.


536
00:42:56.145 --> 00:42:58.354
With the drumsticks? That's good.

537
00:43:01.062 --> 00:43:03.354
We even watched a video.

538
00:43:03.854 --> 00:43:05.062
Really? With drums?

539
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.896
How's your husband?
- Good.


540
00:43:12.187 --> 00:43:15.354
He works, wait here...
- I want them!


541
00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:17.646
He has a job now?
- Yes, in Kirchhain.


542
00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:20.854
Where?
- Car dealership. He reconditions cars.


543
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:28.729
Mr. Bachmann, do you only do music?

544
00:43:28.854 --> 00:43:31.896
That's what some people
say but it's not true.


545
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.938
We also do math and German and art.

546
00:43:36.354 --> 00:43:37.354
PE.

547
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.270
What's your name?
- Emanuel.


548
00:43:40.395 --> 00:43:42.771
Right. I've heard that before.

549
00:44:12.562 --> 00:44:13.896
Great job, Samy.

550
00:44:18.354 --> 00:44:20.187
What do you think, Samy?

551
00:44:21.062 --> 00:44:23.354
You could try it at home, huh?

552
00:47:34.646 --> 00:47:38.062
Ulen also means rear end.

553
00:47:43.187 --> 00:47:44.896
Better take a closer look.

554
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.979
Rear end?
- Wait a sec.


555
00:47:47.145 --> 00:47:48.896
Ulenspiegel

556
00:47:51.896 --> 00:47:52.938
Spiegel

557
00:47:53.062 --> 00:47:54.687
Spegel...

558
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.646
means "ass".

559
00:47:57.979 --> 00:47:59.437
And "Ulen"...

560
00:48:01.437 --> 00:48:03.229
means something like...

561
00:48:04.521 --> 00:48:06.270
kiss my ass.

562
00:48:07.938 --> 00:48:10.395
That's another definition of it.

563
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.979
Didn't know it either. 
I just read it.

564
00:48:22.604 --> 00:48:25.938
And it's important: it's a fable character.

565
00:48:26.938 --> 00:48:31.312
So write all this down, the 3 things.
I'll give you a few minutes.


566
00:48:31.771 --> 00:48:33.812
Just remember them.

567
00:48:44.562 --> 00:48:46.771
We've just learned 3 things.

568
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:48.521
Anastasia?

569
00:48:49.145 --> 00:48:51.145
Ulen means "owls" or "wisdom".

570
00:48:51.812 --> 00:48:53.395
Spiegel means "reality".

571
00:48:54.145 --> 00:48:57.854
And "Ulenspiegel" means "kiss my ass"
in Middle High German.


572
00:48:57.979 --> 00:49:01.521
The symbols are owls,
mirrors and the jester's cap.


573
00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:05.437
Ulenspiegel was spread around in
Middle High German around 1500.


574
00:49:05.562 --> 00:49:08.854
Right. - And there's no
proof that he really lived.


575
00:49:09.145 --> 00:49:10.312
Great.

576
00:49:11.896 --> 00:49:15.896
We can break up into pairs
during the practice lesson


577
00:49:16.896 --> 00:49:18.729
and check each other again.

578
00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:23.062
I really liked one of the stories:
Eulenspiegel and the Children.


579
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.020
I wrote a song about it.

580
00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:30.229
What's so special about Eulenspiegel's
relationship to the children?


581
00:49:30.687 --> 00:49:34.646
When you show the kids the mirror
they see something beautiful in it.


582
00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:39.187
Adults see reality.
- And it's often harsh.


583
00:49:39.312 --> 00:49:42.062
He takes the piss out of the adults.
And the kids?


584
00:49:42.187 --> 00:49:46.604
Jamie? - They always tell the
truth but the adults don't.


585
00:49:46.729 --> 00:49:49.646
The adults lie and the kids
tell the truth. Exactly.


586
00:49:49.812 --> 00:49:54.312
And that's why children are
superior to Eulenspiegel.


587
00:49:54.479 --> 00:49:59.521
Don't fall for his jokes,
for his fooling around.


588
00:49:59.646 --> 00:50:01.562
That's what this text is about.

589
00:50:01.687 --> 00:50:03.646
Wanna sing it again, Stefi?

590
00:50:03.896 --> 00:50:05.687
Ilknur, play keyboard.

591
00:50:05.812 --> 00:50:09.479
Hasan, are you feeling
a bit better? Just tired.


592
00:50:09.646 --> 00:50:12.854
No, I feel sick.
- You're sick?


593
00:50:14.562 --> 00:50:17.604
You can change the piece: dum-da-dum-da.

594
00:50:17.896 --> 00:50:20.103
It starts on the 2nd.

595
00:50:20.437 --> 00:50:22.687
It starts in C major. Play it.

596
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:27.145
Right. And now A minor.

597
00:50:32.145 --> 00:50:33.771
Exactly. Right.

598
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.229
Hasan, would you like to play drums?

599
00:50:40.354 --> 00:50:43.395
Again. 2, 3, 4. 
It starts in C major.

600
00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:49.979
I can't do it.

601
00:50:50.395 --> 00:50:51.395
Listen up...

602
00:51:04.145 --> 00:51:05.521
Great, Hasan!

603
00:51:07.229 --> 00:51:08.896
Grab the bass.

604
00:51:10.771 --> 00:51:14.687
Now C... A.

605
00:51:14.812 --> 00:51:17.521
F, G.

606
00:51:29.812 --> 00:51:34.145
Once there was a man,
who traveled across the land.


607
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:38.145
Eulenspiegel was his name.

608
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:43.145
No one knew from where he came.

609
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:47.812
Fog and smoke,
they were his friends.


610
00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:52.312
Two owls perched
atop his shoulders,


611
00:51:52.437 --> 00:51:55.896
a mirror in his hand.

612
00:51:56.979 --> 00:52:01.437
Suddenly he sat on
the edge of the well,

613
00:52:01.562 --> 00:52:05.062
in colorful garb.

614
00:52:08.229 --> 00:52:11.229
Great. Sounds good.
Who'd like to play along?


615
00:52:11.354 --> 00:52:13.437
Come on, Hasan!

616
00:52:13.646 --> 00:52:15.395
I wanna sleep a bit.

617
00:52:16.062 --> 00:52:19.187
Not "olum", let him sleep.

618
00:52:22.229 --> 00:52:24.938
Bye, Mr. Bachmann!
- Bye!


619
00:52:25.062 --> 00:52:27.437
She always comes too late.
- Traitor!


620
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:30.312
I can't help it? I'm sick.

621
00:52:31.646 --> 00:52:35.020
I hear you want to become a barber.

622
00:52:35.145 --> 00:52:37.354
Yeah.
- Where'd you get that idea?


623
00:52:37.646 --> 00:52:40.604
I watch a lot of videos, pictures.

624
00:52:42.771 --> 00:52:45.187
Because in barber shop... you're

625
00:52:46.103 --> 00:52:50.562
in bad weather always indoors,

626
00:52:50.687 --> 00:52:53.687
in a closed room.
- in a closed room.


627
00:52:55.604 --> 00:52:57.729
With other professions too.

628
00:52:57.854 --> 00:53:00.729
You could become a teacher.
That's usually indoors. - Teacher?


629
00:53:00.854 --> 00:53:04.187
I have to learn a lot.
My German's not so good.


630
00:53:04.312 --> 00:53:06.938
Do you know what barbers make?
- Yes.


631
00:53:08.229 --> 00:53:10.354
I know, for example,

632
00:53:11.646 --> 00:53:15.729
a haircut is 10
or 12 Euros. That's good.

633
00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:19.187
Cut 10 men. That's good.

634
00:53:19.312 --> 00:53:21.521
And what if one of them stinks?

635
00:53:21.729 --> 00:53:24.729
He stinks? Well, 
I won't do him.

636
00:53:24.896 --> 00:53:28.020
I just say I don't have time.
It's full and stuff.


637
00:53:33.646 --> 00:53:36.229
You can practice on me!

638
00:53:38.979 --> 00:53:40.354
All right, mate!

639
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.354
I want to be a
pro boxer, but I don't know

640
00:53:45.687 --> 00:53:48.646
if I'm going to keep doing it.

641
00:53:48.771 --> 00:53:51.938
A professional boxer who's a barber?
That's a novelty.


642
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:53.896
Not bad.

643
00:53:54.103 --> 00:53:55.729
Or maybe amateur boxer.

644
00:53:55.896 --> 00:53:58.229
Or amateur boxer, for example, sure.

645
00:53:58.562 --> 00:54:01.521
Did you get it? 
No one's listening again.

646
00:54:01.646 --> 00:54:03.938
Ayman can only think about himself,

647
00:54:04.062 --> 00:54:06.771
and doesn't listen when
it's someone else's turn.


648
00:54:06.896 --> 00:54:08.312
What was that?

649
00:54:08.646 --> 00:54:10.187
You asked if she,

650
00:54:10.312 --> 00:54:13.979
how she feels while brushing
her teeth in the morning.


651
00:54:14.437 --> 00:54:17.938
And she said sometimes she
doesn't care about herself.


652
00:54:18.187 --> 00:54:21.938
And why doesn't she care about herself?

653
00:54:22.103 --> 00:54:24.312
Why can't she stand herself?

654
00:54:24.437 --> 00:54:26.979
Anastasia,
you've got to explain this better.


655
00:54:27.103 --> 00:54:29.938
I don't want to
learn when I'm supposed to.

656
00:54:30.145 --> 00:54:31.729
Then I don't like myself.

657
00:54:31.979 --> 00:54:34.687
Why not?
- Because then I do a bad job.


658
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.437
Sound familiar, Ilknur?
- Yeah.


659
00:54:37.646 --> 00:54:39.729
I don't know what else to say.

660
00:54:39.938 --> 00:54:42.687
All I can say, Anastasia,

661
00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:45.187
is that I've never felt that way.

662
00:54:45.562 --> 00:54:50.062
If I don't feel like learning then I don't
feel like it. To hell with learning!


663
00:54:51.145 --> 00:54:52.354
You know?

664
00:54:53.103 --> 00:54:57.604
Then a teacher or
someone else can tell me

665
00:54:57.896 --> 00:55:02.103
I'm supposed to learn,
but I could care less.


666
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:04.562
Can you relate?
- Yes.


667
00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:06.479
So how about that attitude?

668
00:55:07.062 --> 00:55:10.062
But then you get bad grades.
- So what?


669
00:55:10.187 --> 00:55:11.646
And you wanna succeed.

670
00:55:11.812 --> 00:55:14.771
But you have. Remember the math test?

671
00:55:14.896 --> 00:55:18.479
But you were upset because Regina-
now you finish the sentence.


672
00:55:18.604 --> 00:55:19.854
got a better grade.

673
00:55:20.103 --> 00:55:22.979
But that was also nice.
Regina was happy for once.


674
00:55:23.229 --> 00:55:25.521
Normally Regina's in that situation.

675
00:55:25.729 --> 00:55:27.354
It was nice, wasn't it?

676
00:55:27.562 --> 00:55:29.479
Weren't you happy for Regina?

677
00:55:32.437 --> 00:55:33.771
Oh, man!

678
00:55:35.145 --> 00:55:36.687
The people of today.

679
00:55:37.103 --> 00:55:41.187
Anastasia, all the teachers
at the class conference agreed:


680
00:55:41.312 --> 00:55:43.854
Anastasia's heading to high school.

681
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:47.395
What has Anastasia decided?
- I don't want to.


682
00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:53.229
So what are you going to do when the
letter arrives? - Go to secondary.


683
00:55:53.812 --> 00:55:57.354
Well that's a first.
I'm looking forward to the letter.


684
00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:59.353
ALWAYS GETS ORANGE BALLS
AND IS CLEVER.


685
00:55:59.408 --> 00:56:02.503
GOOD AT PLAYING DRUMS.
GOOD PAINTER. GOOD BABYSITTER.


686
00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:04.938
I brought along Mr. Konrad.

687
00:56:05.062 --> 00:56:07.812
Do you know what a "singing buddy" is?

688
00:56:07.979 --> 00:56:10.854
Ah, Cengiz, you're so great today.
I love you!


689
00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:13.854
Singing buddies are like me and Hasan.

690
00:56:14.103 --> 00:56:16.062
When I sing he sings along.

691
00:56:16.229 --> 00:56:18.270
Exactly!

692
00:56:18.395 --> 00:56:20.187
And what's a "boozing buddy"?

693
00:56:20.312 --> 00:56:23.979
Boozing buddy is when I
booze and Hasan joins in.


694
00:56:24.354 --> 00:56:26.646
Mr. Bachmann, can we play this song?

695
00:56:58.521 --> 00:57:01.062
I have that song!

696
00:57:37.145 --> 00:57:40.270
This is about your future here at school.

697
00:57:40.521 --> 00:57:42.312
Future? What's that mean?

698
00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:45.562
You'll be switching to
secondary school next year.


699
00:57:59.395 --> 00:58:01.062
My papa's asking-

700
00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:07.938
My father asks: I can't speak much German.

701
00:58:08.062 --> 00:58:09.938
How's this work?

702
00:58:10.145 --> 00:58:11.854
Do you speak Turkish?
- Yes.


703
00:58:12.062 --> 00:58:14.187
In Germany speak good Turkish.

704
00:58:14.395 --> 00:58:19.312
Come to Germany, no
German, Turkish perfect.


705
00:58:19.437 --> 00:58:23.812
Yeah, it's Stadtallendorf: more
Turkish and Russian than German.


706
00:58:24.437 --> 00:58:26.729
So you speak Russian, Turkish, Bulgar-

707
00:58:26.854 --> 00:58:29.604
You can get by with Russian
and Turkish here in Stadtallendorf.


708
00:58:29.938 --> 00:58:34.687
Stefani's always saying:
We're going back to Bulgaria.


709
00:58:34.854 --> 00:58:38.646
Then she says: I'm staying here,
my sister's going back or coming here.


710
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:42.062
What's her future?

711
00:58:42.354 --> 00:58:46.437
Is she staying here? 
Are you staying here?

712
00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:49.229
Or are you going back to Bulgaria?
- We don't know yet.


713
00:59:08.938 --> 00:59:13.562
My papa said we
want to stay in Bulgaria.

714
00:59:14.687 --> 00:59:17.771
But we have to stay in Germany-
- Because of work?


715
00:59:17.896 --> 00:59:20.229
Yes, because of work because in Bulgaria...

716
00:59:20.479 --> 00:59:23.812
- not much work.
- No chance in Bulgaria.


717
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.646
You're a baker? 
Your father's a baker?

718
00:59:26.771 --> 00:59:29.437
Yes, father is baker, me have four kids.

719
00:59:29.562 --> 00:59:31.103
In Bulgaria no chance.

720
00:59:31.229 --> 00:59:33.479
Stefi, what do you want to be?

721
00:59:33.729 --> 00:59:36.687
What kind of a profession?

722
00:59:37.395 --> 00:59:40.437
Bakery saleswoman?

723
00:59:40.687 --> 00:59:43.604
Do you want to become
a nurse or a doctor?

724
00:59:43.729 --> 00:59:46.646
I want... uh... to sing,

725
00:59:46.771 --> 00:59:49.979
but I want doctor a lot.
- No chance.


726
00:59:50.229 --> 00:59:52.479
Good guess, huh? Medicine?
- Yes.


727
01:00:00.812 --> 01:00:03.729
She'd really like to become a singer.
- No way!


728
01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:05.812
Sure!

729
01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.812
Grab the guitar there.

730
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.020
Ah, no, Mr. Bachmann!

731
01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:19.103
I can't now!
- We'll do it in Italian for your father.


732
01:00:25.437 --> 01:00:28.187
I forgot.
- Yeah, right. You know it.


733
01:00:28.312 --> 01:00:30.479
Just sing la, la, la.

734
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.354
She can do it.

735
01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.521
My father said that you

736
01:00:59.687 --> 01:01:03.854
is a good, emotional teacher.

737
01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:06.395
Lots of fun and stuff.

738
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.854
Hey, Mr. Bachmann, I can't.
- Just do it!


739
01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:36.771
Which part?
- The middle one where you-


740
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.479
That's the part. 
Sing it again for me.

741
01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:51.812
I love it! It makes me
feel like I'm on holiday...


742
01:01:52.562 --> 01:01:55.854
at the Black Sea or something.
Sing it again!


743
01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:10.938
Hello.

744
01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:13.270
I'm Dieter Bachmann, the teacher.

745
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.395
Come on in.

746
01:02:22.062 --> 01:02:26.395
You can sit over there. Give your
mom the comfortable chair.


747
01:02:27.312 --> 01:02:30.312
There's a nice rocking chair.

748
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:34.229
So at first it was like:

749
01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:38.145
she hardly said a word but just laughed.

750
01:02:38.395 --> 01:02:40.562
I liked that,

751
01:02:40.854 --> 01:02:44.604
that she laughed.
But she didn't say a word.


752
01:02:44.938 --> 01:02:49.771
But now she raises her hand
and participates in the lessons.


753
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.062
And...

754
01:02:52.687 --> 01:02:55.437
what's it like for you? Tell us.

755
01:02:55.729 --> 01:03:01.354
At first, it was like-I was so shy
and didn't want to say anything.


756
01:03:01.479 --> 01:03:04.854
But now that I've gotten to
know everyone and like them,


757
01:03:05.103 --> 01:03:09.771
I raise my hand more and
dare to say something.


758
01:03:12.562 --> 01:03:15.521
How did you suddenly become so courageous?

759
01:03:15.646 --> 01:03:19.395
Because I'm not afraid to talk
in class anymore and get laughed at.


760
01:03:19.521 --> 01:03:22.270
You were afraid?
- People used to laugh at me.


761
01:03:22.395 --> 01:03:25.604
At your other school?
- Yeah, so I was afraid to raise my hand.


762
01:03:25.729 --> 01:03:28.312
Why did they laugh at you?
- I don't know.


763
01:03:29.687 --> 01:03:32.896
The change to 7th grade is in summer.

764
01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.020
She'd be placed in secondary school.
- The thing is-


765
01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:39.812
What?
- We might move during summer break.


766
01:03:41.521 --> 01:03:42.687
Again.

767
01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:46.604
That blows my mind.
- Hers, too.


768
01:03:47.354 --> 01:03:49.729
Me, too. The problem is-

769
01:03:49.854 --> 01:03:52.437
May I say something in German?
- Shit?


770
01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:55.562
That's shitty.
- Yeah, but what can I do?


771
01:03:55.687 --> 01:04:01.354
I can't just stay here so she can go to
secondary and make something of herself.


772
01:04:01.479 --> 01:04:03.771
I know she won't make it here.

773
01:04:03.979 --> 01:04:06.604
It was really bad with her at first.

774
01:04:06.812 --> 01:04:09.354
You don't think she'd make it here?

775
01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:11.479
Not in these surroundings.

776
01:04:11.687 --> 01:04:14.812
Here?
- No, not here in your class.


777
01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:19.395
Has nothing to do with your class.
From her way of life, where we live now.


778
01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:22.229
Your living conditions are not in order?
- Right.


779
01:04:22.354 --> 01:04:25.103
But she got better and better.

780
01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:28.395
Now, but she was really bad at first.

781
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.020
But she just explained that she
was really afraid. I could tell.


782
01:04:33.187 --> 01:04:37.187
It's called school phobia. She was
afraid of getting her ass kicked.


783
01:04:37.312 --> 01:04:41.020
She was really scared.
- Yeah, I could tell.


784
01:04:41.354 --> 01:04:44.395
But she got over it really fast.

785
01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:47.395
And now she's doing really well here.

786
01:04:48.187 --> 01:04:51.229
Would you like to stay
right here at our school?


787
01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:55.312
Yeah, sure, but we've got a problem.

788
01:04:57.062 --> 01:04:59.395
The three of us want to be alone.

789
01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:04.854
Our old family back together.
Just us. That's all.


790
01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:09.395
And it's not possible in Stadtallendorf?
- No. This Stadtallendorf...


791
01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:12.437
I can't describe it.

792
01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:15.270
I feel really bad for her.

793
01:05:15.437 --> 01:05:18.938
I remember what she was
like when she came here.


794
01:05:19.062 --> 01:05:21.103
She was really small.

795
01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:23.354
And really frightened.

796
01:05:23.521 --> 01:05:26.854
And now she's sitting here all confident.

797
01:05:27.145 --> 01:05:30.729
She trusts her classmates and teachers.

798
01:05:30.896 --> 01:05:33.187
She feels really comfortable here.

799
01:05:33.312 --> 01:05:37.395
She used to feel totally out
of place, hassled and bullied.


800
01:05:37.604 --> 01:05:40.437
Rabia also has a father.
- I know.


801
01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:44.145
And as far as I know,
he lives in Stadtallendorf.


802
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:46.646
No, in Kirchhain, but he works here.

803
01:05:46.771 --> 01:05:49.062
My daughter isn't-
- Your father means a lot to you?


804
01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:50.229
Yes.

805
01:05:50.354 --> 01:05:52.854
And you love your father?
- Yes.


806
01:05:52.979 --> 01:05:55.812
And you're happy you get to see him?
- Yes, of course.


807
01:05:55.979 --> 01:06:00.020
And if you move away, you wouldn't
get to see him as often?


808
01:06:00.145 --> 01:06:03.395
Right?
- Yeah, I know.


809
01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:09.979
Cheer up!

810
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:43.229
Time!

811
01:07:47.103 --> 01:07:50.938
Don't stop. Hook, punch and turn.

812
01:07:51.062 --> 01:07:54.103
Right in the middle. 
Come over here.

813
01:07:54.229 --> 01:07:57.604
1, 2, middle. Not in the back.

814
01:07:57.854 --> 01:07:59.979
Got it? 1, 2, 1, 2.

815
01:08:00.103 --> 01:08:03.145
And you keep pausing.

816
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.854
You have to hit like this.

817
01:08:05.979 --> 01:08:09.145
I mean it's good when you're here.

818
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:12.098
But you've got to bite the bullet
and work out on your own.


819
01:08:12.137 --> 01:08:13.954
I show you how every Friday.

820
01:08:14.187 --> 01:08:17.270
You know what works.
You have to do it on your own.


821
01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:21.020
But Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
the sandbags are always taken.


822
01:08:21.145 --> 01:08:25.229
There are always two sandbags
for you. You can spar a bit.


823
01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:28.729
We'll spar and when we're
tired we'll call it a day.


824
01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.646
When it gets lighter out
we'll start running outside.


825
01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.896
Punch. A bit faster.

826
01:08:50.938 --> 01:08:53.437
2 -1 -2. To the front. 
Only to the front.

827
01:08:55.812 --> 01:08:59.771
10, 9, 8, 7...

828
01:08:59.896 --> 01:09:03.145
6, 5, 4...

829
01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:06.562
3, give it your all, 2, 1.

830
01:09:06.687 --> 01:09:08.270
And stop!

831
01:09:21.062 --> 01:09:24.103
Somehow it doesn't turn me on.

832
01:09:24.646 --> 01:09:26.479
Doesn't turn me on.

833
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.646
Play something that turns us.

834
01:09:29.771 --> 01:09:31.771
What do I mean by "turn on"?

835
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:37.562
I don't know.

836
01:09:37.812 --> 01:09:40.729
I say such things but you
have no idea what I mean.


837
01:09:40.854 --> 01:09:44.229
Take me along. - Yeah,
take you along and keep up the tempo.


838
01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:46.979
Play together.
- Yeah, so it's fun.


839
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.562
Take you along and have fun.

840
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:53.187
Take me with you and show me
some fun. I have a break now.


841
01:09:59.938 --> 01:10:02.312
Can I talk to you about it?
- Yes.


842
01:10:02.521 --> 01:10:04.354
Because I'm interested.

843
01:10:05.103 --> 01:10:07.479
Then you suddenly get furious.
- Yeah.


844
01:10:07.646 --> 01:10:09.145
And then?

845
01:10:11.687 --> 01:10:13.479
What does "furious" mean?

846
01:10:13.604 --> 01:10:15.562
Ah, I could tell.

847
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.521
I see.

848
01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.395
What...

849
01:10:21.646 --> 01:10:23.521
am I supposed to say?

850
01:10:23.854 --> 01:10:27.521
For example, you punched
Abdurrahman in the face once.


851
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:31.812
I didn't him in face.
- Where then?


852
01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:35.687
I just hit him here.

853
01:10:35.812 --> 01:10:37.896
And that knocked him down?
- Yes.


854
01:10:39.521 --> 01:10:41.312
He's always saying stuff like:

855
01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:44.479
Come, try to hit me, asshole.
And stuff like that.


856
01:10:44.604 --> 01:10:46.395
What else can I do?

857
01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:51.062
And you want him to stop?
- Yes.


858
01:10:51.187 --> 01:10:54.103
And because he wouldn't
stop you knocked him down?


859
01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:56.562
Have you done that to anyone else?
- No.


860
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.854
Sure?

861
01:10:58.562 --> 01:11:03.312
Because I've gotten some complaints
about how aggressive you get.


862
01:11:03.854 --> 01:11:06.812
It'd be great if you came
on the class trip with us.


863
01:11:06.938 --> 01:11:08.854
Yeah, I asked for permission.
- And?


864
01:11:08.979 --> 01:11:11.187
They said okay.
- They did? Great!


865
01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:13.812
Bye!
- Bye, Erdzhan.


866
01:11:31.938 --> 01:11:34.229
You really like it here, huh?
- Yes.


867
01:11:34.604 --> 01:11:38.145
Why did you stick around?

868
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.521
Tell me the truth: Why
did you stick around?


869
01:11:40.646 --> 01:11:43.187
You know Allah says
you're not allowed to lie.


870
01:11:43.312 --> 01:11:45.312
Because I don't want to go outside.

871
01:11:45.437 --> 01:11:47.479
Aha. Too cold?
- Yes.


872
01:12:10.896 --> 01:12:13.437
When I look back,

873
01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:18.229
the worst part was always
feeling like the only one.


874
01:12:18.354 --> 01:12:19.771
Do you feel the same way?

875
01:12:19.896 --> 01:12:22.812
You're the only one who got an 'F'.

876
01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:23.979
No.
- Who else?


877
01:12:24.103 --> 01:12:26.145
Hasan, Stefi, Mattia.

878
01:12:27.896 --> 01:12:30.437
That's great, huh?

879
01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:33.521
I was always the
only one with an 'F'.

880
01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:36.938
But we didn't learn, Mr. Bachmann.
- I got a 'C'. - You nerd!


881
01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:40.354
We have a few more, Ilknur.
You're not alone.


882
01:12:40.646 --> 01:12:42.270
I have a suggestion.

883
01:12:42.771 --> 01:12:47.562
We're going to learn English
vocabulary with Ilknur and Stefi.


884
01:12:47.687 --> 01:12:52.270
Then I'm going to ask the teacher
to let you re-take the vocabulary test.


885
01:12:52.395 --> 01:12:54.604
What? Everyone else too?

886
01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.521
No, only these four.

887
01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:58.854
Let's see: Who got an 'A'?

888
01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.062
Ah, Anastasia! Who got a 'B'?

889
01:13:02.354 --> 01:13:04.187
Ilknur, you get Anastasia.

890
01:13:04.395 --> 01:13:08.229
Stefi, Rabia got a 'B'.
You can learn together.


891
01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:11.854
Jamie, you take Hasan.

892
01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:15.145
Tim, you take Mattia.

893
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:17.020
Practice the vocabulary now.

894
01:13:17.145 --> 01:13:20.479
I'll test you in twenty minutes.

895
01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:21.771
Jamie?

896
01:13:22.145 --> 01:13:25.854
Honestly, I think this is bullshit.

897
01:13:26.062 --> 01:13:29.979
I mean we learned. Mattia had
an excuse. He was sick.


898
01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:32.604
But the rest of us learned.

899
01:13:32.729 --> 01:13:35.229
And if they didn't it's their own fault.

900
01:13:35.395 --> 01:13:37.312
Hey, we got an 'F'!

901
01:13:37.562 --> 01:13:40.145
Not a 'B', not a 'C',
not a 'D', but an 'F'.


902
01:13:40.395 --> 01:13:41.604
It's your own fault.

903
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:45.938
Wait a minute.
You can speak your mind, but-


904
01:13:46.312 --> 01:13:51.979
Hasan, Stefi and Mattia have been
here in Germany for barely a year.


905
01:13:52.103 --> 01:13:54.479
I'd like to see you, Jamie.

906
01:13:54.604 --> 01:13:56.938
You're all here from the German course,

907
01:13:57.103 --> 01:14:00.187
and really just joined our class.

908
01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:03.354
Since this semester, only a few days.

909
01:14:03.479 --> 01:14:06.312
Up to now, you weren't being graded.

910
01:14:07.437 --> 01:14:10.812
And they were exempt from grades, Jamie,

911
01:14:11.062 --> 01:14:15.646
because they come from another country
and speak neither German nor English.


912
01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.062
That's why I think it's fair

913
01:14:19.854 --> 01:14:22.479
when they still get a second chance.

914
01:14:22.896 --> 01:14:24.604
You can learn now,

915
01:14:24.854 --> 01:14:26.979
then we'll check the results.

916
01:14:27.312 --> 01:14:31.187
We'll keep an eye on you. Study hard.

917
01:14:31.437 --> 01:14:33.020
I'll check it.

918
01:14:33.437 --> 01:14:35.229
Then we'll see if it gets better.

919
01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:39.646
I think we should stick
together as a class,


920
01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.604
and help those kids who are struggling.

921
01:14:44.729 --> 01:14:46.771
So they learn the vocabulary.
- Okay.


922
01:14:46.938 --> 01:14:51.103
Jamie, I'm not going to force you
to practice with anyone.


923
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:53.896
I can also do it with Hasan.

924
01:14:54.145 --> 01:14:57.938
No, I'll do it. - Or you,
Cengiz. You got a 'C'. That's okay.


925
01:14:58.062 --> 01:15:00.145
How's that, Jamie?

926
01:15:02.312 --> 01:15:04.729
You and Ilknur have been friends
since elementary school.


927
01:15:04.854 --> 01:15:06.729
That has nothing to do with it.

928
01:15:06.854 --> 01:15:10.020
I don't get it.
Why don't you want to help her?


929
01:15:10.187 --> 01:15:12.896
I'm not going to help
if it's her own fault.


930
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.646
It's not her fault.
There are some problems,


931
01:15:17.854 --> 01:15:20.145
and I'm telling you as an adult,

932
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:24.437
it's not Ilknur's fault
that she's struggling right now.


933
01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.938
Yes, it is.
- Do you understand?


934
01:15:27.103 --> 01:15:29.938
You don't understand.
- I'm sticking to my opinion.


935
01:15:30.145 --> 01:15:33.145
She's got other problems we
don't need to talk about here.


936
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.687
That's why she's so bad.
And you've been friends for years.


937
01:15:36.812 --> 01:15:41.103
You could help her. What's wrong
with practicing vocabulary together?


938
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:43.646
I'm sticking to my opinion.
- What?


939
01:15:43.771 --> 01:15:46.229
I'm sticking to my opinion. It sucks.

940
01:15:46.354 --> 01:15:47.562
Okay.

941
01:15:48.938 --> 01:15:50.395
Stefi?

942
01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:55.145
Here in the class no
one know how hard is,

943
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:57.562
because everyone was born here.

944
01:15:57.979 --> 01:16:02.145
Jamie. Everyone. Rabia. Thea.

945
01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:06.145
You know how hard it is?
You have to learn German,


946
01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.938
English, make social studies poster.

947
01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:12.771
I can't... I speak
German but not so much.

948
01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:16.270
I've still got to learn vocabulary.

949
01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:19.312
German. I've got to
learn English vocabulary.


950
01:16:19.771 --> 01:16:21.646
It's too hard for me.

951
01:16:21.771 --> 01:16:24.270
But you always say your, well, yeah.

952
01:16:24.437 --> 01:16:25.646
Thanks, Stefi.

953
01:16:25.812 --> 01:16:27.145
It's too hard.

954
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:30.020
Ayman, when we talked
to your dad yesterday,


955
01:16:30.145 --> 01:16:32.604
you said something that really touched me.

956
01:16:32.729 --> 01:16:34.979
Yeah, we came here,

957
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:38.604
and there was a bench
in front of our house.


958
01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:42.437
And because it was summer I was outside.

959
01:16:43.062 --> 01:16:47.938
My parents were carrying
furniture and stuff inside.


960
01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:51.270
And there were other boys around.

961
01:16:51.437 --> 01:16:53.812
And they asked me some questions.

962
01:16:54.103 --> 01:16:56.521
But I didn't understand anything.

963
01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:01.312
And it felt...

964
01:17:01.938 --> 01:17:03.812
strange because...

965
01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:07.812
I tried to explain
something but couldn't.


966
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.103
We just made hand signals and stuff.

967
01:17:10.395 --> 01:17:13.395
And the one boy laughed at me.

968
01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:15.229
And I didn't like it.

969
01:17:16.938 --> 01:17:18.771
And how was it later on?

970
01:17:19.103 --> 01:17:22.020
It was still hard, especially at school.

971
01:17:22.145 --> 01:17:25.854
We had to learn several
languages and that was hard.


972
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:29.604
But after a while, 
I learned German.

973
01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:31.812
Then it got easier and easier.

974
01:17:32.145 --> 01:17:35.479
Can you relate to Stefi and Hasan?
- Yes.


975
01:17:35.812 --> 01:17:37.229
Yes?
- Yes.


976
01:17:37.354 --> 01:17:41.979
Now you're really good at school
and you're heading to high school.


977
01:17:42.395 --> 01:17:46.270
How can you help those

978
01:17:46.604 --> 01:17:49.687
who are now where
you were five years ago?

979
01:17:50.687 --> 01:17:56.479
Maybe practice with them.
German, for example.


980
01:17:57.187 --> 01:18:00.145
Now say a little bit about your father.

981
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:03.896
I didn't realize until yesterday
that he emigrated from Morocco


982
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:08.896
to Italy because they couldn't find
work and had nothing to eat.


983
01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:11.854
He lived there 20 years,

984
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.354
learned proper Italian,

985
01:18:14.646 --> 01:18:16.938
worked there as a truck driver.

986
01:18:17.312 --> 01:18:21.062
Then when things got
worse with work in Italy,


987
01:18:21.312 --> 01:18:25.812
he decided to emigrate
again, this time to Germany.


988
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.229
So what you're going through,
Hasan, he went through twice.


989
01:18:29.354 --> 01:18:31.729
A new language, a new culture.

990
01:18:32.395 --> 01:18:36.854
Ayman, when you were
telling me this yesterday,


991
01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:40.521
you were really sad about how
things were when you arrived here.


992
01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:44.771
How that boy laughed at
you, and also later on.


993
01:18:44.896 --> 01:18:48.687
It took a long time before you
felt like they accepted you.


994
01:18:50.312 --> 01:18:52.979
And I think we're a class,

995
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:57.479
and I'd really like to see us
help one another the best we can.


996
01:18:57.729 --> 01:19:00.187
Because... also...

997
01:19:00.479 --> 01:19:02.395
your father, Jamie...

998
01:19:07.562 --> 01:19:10.687
you want to go there soon.
Where's he from?


999
01:19:10.896 --> 01:19:13.312
Transylvania.
- Right, Transylvania.


1000
01:19:13.604 --> 01:19:16.062
Where's that?
- Romania.


1001
01:19:16.187 --> 01:19:18.562
Your father grew up in Romania

1002
01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:22.062
and was a Transylvanian
German living there.


1003
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:25.354
Then he came here
for much the same reason

1004
01:19:26.771 --> 01:19:31.729
that Ayman's father left Morocco for Italy.

1005
01:19:31.979 --> 01:19:35.938
Or why Hasan's parents came to Germany.

1006
01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:39.103
Or why Mattia's parents
came here from Sardinia.


1007
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:41.646
Raffaele, are you also from Sardinia?
- Yes.


1008
01:19:42.687 --> 01:19:45.812
My father comes. He works.

1009
01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:48.687
And my mama...

1010
01:19:50.395 --> 01:19:53.270
Anastasia, where are your parents from?
- Kazakhstan.


1011
01:19:53.395 --> 01:19:57.604
You were born here, but both of
your parents are from Kazakhstan.


1012
01:19:57.854 --> 01:20:00.103
And your mothers are sisters.

1013
01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:03.604
You have Kazakh roots.

1014
01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:06.854
You told us your grandpa still lives there.

1015
01:20:07.062 --> 01:20:09.395
Not anymore.
- Why not?


1016
01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.854
Did he die?

1017
01:20:13.812 --> 01:20:17.521
I'm sorry, Regina.
We have to comfort her real quick.


1018
01:20:24.479 --> 01:20:26.437
Today's a...

1019
01:20:33.854 --> 01:20:37.771
Thea, you can comfort
her, but I want to ask you


1020
01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.812
where your mother's from.

1021
01:20:40.145 --> 01:20:42.229
My mother's from Brazil.

1022
01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.270
Your mother's from Brazil.

1023
01:20:44.395 --> 01:20:46.896
Martin, where are your parents from?
- Russia.


1024
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:48.812
From Russia. Where?

1025
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.562
I don't really know.

1026
01:20:50.854 --> 01:20:55.354
From Russia and not from Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan? - I don't know.


1027
01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.812
So we want to learn English
so we get better at it.


1028
01:21:08.812 --> 01:21:12.145
Hey, this isn't a good work environment.

1029
01:21:15.812 --> 01:21:16.896
Silentium.

1030
01:21:17.103 --> 01:21:18.896
Only whisper, if at all.

1031
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.229
Otherwise I don't want to hear anyone.

1032
01:21:21.896 --> 01:21:23.312
Learn!

1033
01:21:25.062 --> 01:21:27.395
Come to me if you need help.

1034
01:21:33.562 --> 01:21:38.395
I've never seen two students eavesdrop
on each other while learning vocabulary.


1035
01:21:42.979 --> 01:21:44.604
Delivery service!

1036
01:21:44.729 --> 01:21:47.729
Anyone hungry? We have an extra meal.
- I'm hungry.


1037
01:21:47.854 --> 01:21:49.604
Ilknur, dig in.

1038
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:51.562
I'm hungry!
- Come here.


1039
01:21:51.687 --> 01:21:55.938
I've got some change. You can
buy yourselves another meal.


1040
01:21:59.604 --> 01:22:03.562
I don't eat meat.
- Fine. Then go get yourself something.


1041
01:22:03.687 --> 01:22:05.771
Thanks, Mr. Bachmann.
- Have some salad.


1042
01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.854
Thanks a lot, Mr. Bachmann.
- You're welcome.


1043
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.521
What's this?

1044
01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:16.145
Hmmmm...

1045
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:22.437
Do you eat spaghetti at home, too, Ilknur?

1046
01:22:24.187 --> 01:22:25.437
Sometimes.

1047
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:27.979
Carolin, aren't you hungry?
- No.


1048
01:22:28.103 --> 01:22:30.646
Did you already take your shots today?
- Yes.


1049
01:22:30.771 --> 01:22:32.854
How often?
- 2 or 3 times.


1050
01:22:33.771 --> 01:22:36.354
But everything's okay, right?
- Yep.


1051
01:22:36.521 --> 01:22:39.521
Who cooks at home, Carolin?
- My grandma.


1052
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:44.938
With us it's either me,
my father or my mother. - Really?


1053
01:22:46.103 --> 01:22:48.354
Who's the best cook?

1054
01:22:49.646 --> 01:22:51.646
That's what I figured.

1055
01:22:51.771 --> 01:22:53.854
If you're such a good cook, Ilknur?

1056
01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.020
Then you and Stefi

1057
01:22:57.312 --> 01:23:00.562
could cook for the
whole class on our trip.

1058
01:23:00.854 --> 01:23:04.687
But we have to go shopping.
- Sure, we'll go together.


1059
01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:09.020
My mom taught me to
cook when I was 9.

1060
01:23:09.145 --> 01:23:10.729
What does your dad do?

1061
01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.103
He works at Fritz Winter.

1062
01:23:14.604 --> 01:23:17.896
It's right at your doorstep.
- Yep.


1063
01:23:19.437 --> 01:23:21.354
What does your father do, Carolin?

1064
01:23:21.479 --> 01:23:24.103
He works on a construction site.

1065
01:23:24.771 --> 01:23:26.687
Which construction site?

1066
01:23:27.312 --> 01:23:30.812
At the new indoor swimming pool.
- Cool!


1067
01:23:32.979 --> 01:23:35.270
And your mom's a teacher?
- Yeah.


1068
01:23:35.437 --> 01:23:37.479
Music, right?
- Yeah.


1069
01:23:41.562 --> 01:23:43.938
Do you have a lot of visitors, Ilknur?

1070
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:45.771
Yes, every day.

1071
01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.562
Our neighbor comes over every evening.

1072
01:23:48.687 --> 01:23:54.187
She and my mom have been friends
since she was 30 or 20 or so.


1073
01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:56.354
They're best friends.

1074
01:23:56.479 --> 01:24:01.312
And my youngest sister comes every night.
She always wants to belly dance.


1075
01:24:01.562 --> 01:24:04.020
How old is she?
- One, almost two.


1076
01:24:04.145 --> 01:24:07.395
She's almost 2 and wants to
belly dance all the time? - Yes.


1077
01:24:07.521 --> 01:24:10.062
Where's she get this?
- From my mother.


1078
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:12.646
She belly dances all the time too?
- Yes.


1079
01:24:12.812 --> 01:24:15.521
While cooking and cleaning or what?

1080
01:24:15.646 --> 01:24:17.771
Not while cooking but she hops around.

1081
01:24:17.896 --> 01:24:19.687
Is there music playing?

1082
01:24:19.896 --> 01:24:21.562
We did that once here too.

1083
01:24:21.812 --> 01:24:24.687
You had the guts to do it with Cengiz.
It was great.


1084
01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.270
I liked it.

1085
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:32.646
Cengiz?

1086
01:24:33.145 --> 01:24:36.938
Come sit down next to me.
You can be my assistant.


1087
01:24:37.479 --> 01:24:40.229
For the next 15 minutes, concentrate.

1088
01:24:40.521 --> 01:24:42.938
Repeat fractions.

1089
01:24:43.395 --> 01:24:46.854
Then you can practice for
another 15 minutes, and that's it.


1090
01:24:47.062 --> 01:24:48.938
We'll take a break.

1091
01:24:49.062 --> 01:24:52.270
Then we'll do German. We have
to practice grammar again.


1092
01:24:52.479 --> 01:24:56.229
The next test is about tall tales.
We've already done a lot.


1093
01:24:56.812 --> 01:24:58.812
I lost my cell phone.

1094
01:24:59.062 --> 01:25:02.312
That's good. Forget about the spelling.
Mattia?


1095
01:25:02.437 --> 01:25:04.145
I losst mine cel fone.

1096
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:05.729
I subject.

1097
01:25:05.896 --> 01:25:07.604
Okay.
- But...


1098
01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:10.479
predicate?
- "lost".


1099
01:25:10.646 --> 01:25:12.938
Lost predicate.

1100
01:25:13.938 --> 01:25:16.395
My...
- How do you ask about it?


1101
01:25:16.854 --> 01:25:18.562
Who or what did I lose?

1102
01:25:18.896 --> 01:25:20.771
What's this?
- Accusative object.


1103
01:25:20.896 --> 01:25:22.979
Accusative object. Great!

1104
01:25:25.187 --> 01:25:27.354
Ayman, did you get it?

1105
01:25:27.854 --> 01:25:30.103
Dictate a sentence.

1106
01:25:30.437 --> 01:25:32.312
Ferhan!
- Cuckoo!


1107
01:25:32.771 --> 01:25:34.437
Wow, Ferhan's upset.

1108
01:25:34.687 --> 01:25:35.687
Cengiz.

1109
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.812
Stefi always hits Cengizhan.

1110
01:25:41.729 --> 01:25:44.062
Stefi hits...
- Read it out loud. Cengiz.


1111
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:46.312
Stefi hits with 'i'.

1112
01:25:46.479 --> 01:25:49.437
That doesn't matter.
- "Stefi hits Cengizhan."


1113
01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:52.687
"always" hits Cengizhan.
- What are the parts of the sentence.


1114
01:25:52.812 --> 01:25:54.187
What is "Stefi"?

1115
01:25:54.312 --> 01:25:56.729
I don't know, Mr. Bachmann.
I'm bad at this.


1116
01:25:56.854 --> 01:25:59.103
Stefi is this creature here. Regina?

1117
01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:00.270
An animal.

1118
01:26:00.395 --> 01:26:03.395
Subject. Exactly! 
Ilknur, what's "hits"?

1119
01:26:03.646 --> 01:26:06.187
Hits is predicate.
- "always hits".


1120
01:26:06.312 --> 01:26:08.854
Predicate. "Cengizhan"?

1121
01:26:08.979 --> 01:26:11.437
Accusative object.
- Add a dative to it.


1122
01:26:11.729 --> 01:26:14.576
"hits Cengizhan...

1123
01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:16.432
with...

1124
01:26:16.647 --> 01:26:17.955
with the guitar."

1125
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:22.896
What is "with the guitar"?
- Nothing.


1126
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:25.896
With whom does...?
- Cengizhan is kaput.


1127
01:26:26.479 --> 01:26:28.521
There's an exercise in the book.

1128
01:26:28.646 --> 01:26:31.854
We won't do it now because
we did so much math before.


1129
01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:35.646
We'll do it tomorrow.
- While we're eating kebab!


1130
01:26:35.854 --> 01:26:38.521
That's it. Take a seat.

1131
01:26:40.062 --> 01:26:42.812
Mr. Bachmann, I love my class!

1132
01:26:42.938 --> 01:26:44.646
Now for the last task.

1133
01:26:44.771 --> 01:26:47.646
If you solve it without screaming,

1134
01:26:47.854 --> 01:26:51.020
then you may go home.
- Hey, Ayman, do it!


1135
01:26:51.145 --> 01:26:53.437
You're the only one we trust.

1136
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:57.854
A pizza as big
as a truck tire. Okay?

1137
01:26:58.854 --> 01:27:00.896
Now I'd like to know

1138
01:27:01.187 --> 01:27:04.270
how much does each of you get?

1139
01:27:04.395 --> 01:27:07.145
Thea Lucia, how many are
there including the sick ones?


1140
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:09.479
19 not including you.

1141
01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:11.979
19 not including you.
- No, 20.


1142
01:27:12.103 --> 01:27:13.354
19!

1143
01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:18.187
Anastasia, how much do you
get if there are 19 pupils?


1144
01:27:18.312 --> 01:27:20.270
I'm still figuring it out.
- Okay.


1145
01:27:20.395 --> 01:27:22.270
Then you've got lots to calculate.

1146
01:27:22.896 --> 01:27:24.771
Martin, do you know?

1147
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:28.854
But, Martin, we don't want
them to beat you up outside.


1148
01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.562
Carolin, stand up.

1149
01:27:30.771 --> 01:27:35.229
Say really loudly how
much of the pizza you get.


1150
01:27:35.521 --> 01:27:37.437
One-nineteenth.
- I love you!


1151
01:27:43.812 --> 01:27:46.145
Everyone stands behind his chair,

1152
01:27:46.979 --> 01:27:48.812
and cleans off his desk.

1153
01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.854
Then we'll have a moment of silence.

1154
01:27:52.395 --> 01:27:54.812
Mr. Bachmann, this sucks!

1155
01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:58.479
Cengizhan! Quiet down!

1156
01:27:58.812 --> 01:28:01.604
I'm the only one who has
something to say here.


1157
01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:04.521
Everyone behind his chair.

1158
01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:08.938
Mattia, explain this to Raffaele.
It's new for him.


1159
01:28:09.187 --> 01:28:13.145
One minute silentium. 
Absolute silence.

1160
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:16.312
If anyone talks or interferes like Stefi,

1161
01:28:16.812 --> 01:28:20.395
then we'll extend it. 
We're about to start.

1162
01:28:21.354 --> 01:28:24.521
What's the big deal?

1163
01:28:25.312 --> 01:28:28.270
Stefi, we're extending it because of you.

1164
01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.938
Are you ready now, Stefi?

1165
01:28:34.437 --> 01:28:37.270
One minute of silence.
I'll tell you when to start.


1166
01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:41.187
And if someone talks, then the
whole class does another minute.


1167
01:28:41.354 --> 01:28:43.020
We'll do it until it works.

1168
01:29:17.896 --> 01:29:19.020
Okay.

1169
01:29:20.062 --> 01:29:22.771
I'll say "go" in a sec,
but I haven't said it yet.


1170
01:29:22.938 --> 01:29:26.771
We're going to go down the
stairs just as quietly.


1171
01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:32.187
We'll exit the school grounds
behind the special ed building,


1172
01:29:32.312 --> 01:29:35.020
because everyone else has

1173
01:29:35.145 --> 01:29:36.604
I'll look out the window.

1174
01:29:36.729 --> 01:29:39.229
And if I see anyone walking
across the school grounds,


1175
01:29:39.354 --> 01:29:40.854
I'll grab him.

1176
01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:45.145
Go down the stairs like normal
people, no screaming,


1177
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:48.896
and exit the school grounds
the shortest way possible.


1178
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:53.646
Martin, your former classmates from
elementary school will show you the way.


1179
01:29:53.812 --> 01:29:55.145
How was your 1st day?

1180
01:29:55.395 --> 01:29:57.729
Do you think you'll survive here?

1181
01:29:58.729 --> 01:30:01.354
Raffaele?
- Except if I...


1182
01:30:01.604 --> 01:30:03.270
How was your day?

1183
01:30:03.562 --> 01:30:06.103
Crappy.
- Translate please, Mattia.


1184
01:30:06.312 --> 01:30:09.604
Bene? Molto bene? Un poco bene?

1185
01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:12.103
Molto bene.
- Un poco bene.


1186
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:13.687
Oh, molto bene?

1187
01:30:13.812 --> 01:30:16.187
What does "molto bene" mean?
- "Very good".


1188
01:30:16.437 --> 01:30:18.074
Why don't you ask us about our day?

1189
01:30:18.099 --> 01:30:21.336
You're taking the floor again.
Maybe I'll add time.


1190
01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:27.479
Yes, Cengiz?
- My day sucked.


1191
01:30:27.604 --> 01:30:30.896
I thought it got off to a good start.
We can discuss it tomorrow.


1192
01:30:31.103 --> 01:30:32.395
Okay?

1193
01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:36.437
And we're going to leave here as usual.

1194
01:30:37.103 --> 01:30:38.604
Bye! Take care.

1195
01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:46.229
We're extending...
Mr. Bachmann was too loud!


1196
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:12.979
Cengiz, go home!

1197
01:32:49.062 --> 01:32:50.771
They came from the countryside:

1198
01:32:50.896 --> 01:32:54.020
unskilled agricultural workers
or small, independent farmers.


1199
01:32:54.145 --> 01:32:58.270
But the unsocial distribution of land
no longer fed them and their families.


1200
01:32:58.395 --> 01:33:04.437
The personnel manager came to Istanbul,
where thousands wait years for a job.


1201
01:33:04.562 --> 01:33:06.729
Poverty drove them from their villages.

1202
01:33:06.854 --> 01:33:10.395
They heard there are
well-paid jobs in Germany.


1203
01:33:10.521 --> 01:33:15.562
And sometimes Germany seems like
the promised land for earning money.


1204
01:33:16.145 --> 01:33:18.395
Zafer Aygün, Ali Öztürk,

1205
01:33:18.729 --> 01:33:20.270
Hasan Ali Barutcu

1206
01:33:20.646 --> 01:33:21.979
Izzet Özyön,

1207
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:23.854
Ahmet Aktaş,

1208
01:33:23.979 --> 01:33:25.604
Mehmet Özver,

1209
01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:27.145
Sabri Çetin.

1210
01:33:35.938 --> 01:33:39.437
They arrived full of hope mixed with fear.

1211
01:33:40.395 --> 01:33:42.979
Fear whether their papers are in order.

1212
01:33:43.604 --> 01:33:47.562
Fear of work and their employers,
fear of the strange surroundings.


1213
01:33:48.354 --> 01:33:51.854
Plus they didn't speak German.
This made them helpless.


1214
01:33:55.979 --> 01:33:58.646
They were used to hard work from home.

1215
01:33:58.812 --> 01:34:02.437
But it was agricultural work, nature.

1216
01:34:02.604 --> 01:34:05.812
They lived according to the
rhythm of summer and winter.


1217
01:34:16.646 --> 01:34:21.312
On weekends, the workers sometimes
try to escape their loneliness.


1218
01:34:21.437 --> 01:34:25.312
But the fact that they meet in
their hostel basement


1219
01:34:25.479 --> 01:34:28.270
shows how they remain in their ghetto.

1220
01:34:42.812 --> 01:34:45.729
Do you know anything
about Islam and Muslims?


1221
01:34:45.854 --> 01:34:50.187
Well, it's a religious state, huh?

1222
01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.521
You know there are Turks here in Allendorf?
- Yes.


1223
01:34:54.646 --> 01:34:59.312
Have you heard about the Turks who
work here? - They're upstanding.


1224
01:34:59.521 --> 01:35:02.437
They're devout.

1225
01:35:02.562 --> 01:35:05.270
Have you ever been inside a mosque before?
- No.


1226
01:35:05.395 --> 01:35:06.646
The first time?
- Yes.


1227
01:35:14.312 --> 01:35:18.312
The Turkish were brought
to Germany to work.


1228
01:35:18.437 --> 01:35:21.896
- Guest workers.
Yes, guest workers and


1229
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:26.521
the others came here because of
war or poverty, I think.


1230
01:35:26.646 --> 01:35:30.854
That's right. At some point people
came here from other countries.


1231
01:35:30.979 --> 01:35:33.103
Abdu interjected something.

1232
01:35:33.354 --> 01:35:36.145
I think it was 1960,

1233
01:35:36.812 --> 01:35:40.229
around 1 million guest workers
came to Germany.


1234
01:35:40.395 --> 01:35:43.812
And who are these guest
workers usually? Alpi?


1235
01:35:44.103 --> 01:35:46.854
Is there a guest worker in your family?

1236
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:49.771
Yes, my papa.

1237
01:35:49.896 --> 01:35:51.145
He's from Turkey.

1238
01:35:51.354 --> 01:35:55.729
What's hanging at the top left?
Can anyone recognize it?


1239
01:35:56.604 --> 01:36:01.437
Regina? - I think it's the
cross where Jesus was crucified.


1240
01:36:01.771 --> 01:36:05.854
How can you tell? 
It's really hard to see.

1241
01:36:06.771 --> 01:36:10.354
I can see a cross
with some figure on it.

1242
01:36:11.687 --> 01:36:16.020
Why did a cross hang in
classrooms back then?


1243
01:36:16.562 --> 01:36:20.145
Maybe there weren't any
Muslim kids in that class,


1244
01:36:20.479 --> 01:36:24.395
or maybe only a few,
and they didn't mind.


1245
01:36:24.521 --> 01:36:27.270
And that's why it was in the classroom.

1246
01:36:27.395 --> 01:36:31.395
Who would mind if there
were a cross hanging here?


1247
01:36:31.604 --> 01:36:33.103
With Jesus.

1248
01:36:35.103 --> 01:36:37.062
Ilknur, why would you mind?

1249
01:36:37.229 --> 01:36:41.687
Because I don't believe in such things.
- But the others do.


1250
01:36:42.145 --> 01:36:45.771
It would bother Ilknur because
she doesn't believe in it.


1251
01:36:46.103 --> 01:36:49.938
Jamie?
- I find such things, well,


1252
01:36:50.312 --> 01:36:55.312
stupid, I'd say, because I'm a
disbeliever. I don't believe in anything.


1253
01:36:55.521 --> 01:37:00.604
I don't mind if there are believers
here, so I think it kinda sucks when


1254
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.646
they have a problem with it.

1255
01:37:04.312 --> 01:37:07.187
Ilknur, don't you want to say anything?
- No.


1256
01:37:07.854 --> 01:37:10.229
Cengizhan, you raised your hand.

1257
01:37:10.354 --> 01:37:13.896
You'd also have a problem
with hanging a cross here?


1258
01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:16.938
Why?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.


1259
01:37:17.437 --> 01:37:22.521
That some teachers take trips to church
and Muslim kids have to go along.


1260
01:37:22.771 --> 01:37:25.354
It's really stupid.

1261
01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.729
Ilknur, are Muslims not
allowed to enter a church?


1262
01:37:35.646 --> 01:37:38.354
Is entering a church forbidden?
- Yes.


1263
01:37:38.604 --> 01:37:39.979
Who says this?

1264
01:37:41.145 --> 01:37:42.521
She!

1265
01:37:42.938 --> 01:37:44.687
Who says that, Ilknur?

1266
01:37:44.896 --> 01:37:48.270
My old mosque teacher.
That's what she told us.


1267
01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:50.354
I don't believe this, Ilknur.

1268
01:37:50.521 --> 01:37:54.938
No idea.
- You should... we'll talk about it later.


1269
01:37:55.646 --> 01:37:59.729
Unfortunately,
you've got some things a bit wrong.


1270
01:37:59.854 --> 01:38:02.938
So this is a very recent picture.

1271
01:38:03.312 --> 01:38:07.145
It's not hard to see where we are.

1272
01:38:07.395 --> 01:38:09.187
Who said 'Teich' [pond]?
- I did.


1273
01:38:09.312 --> 01:38:11.437
Raise your hand and then-

1274
01:38:11.812 --> 01:38:15.354
You said something really
important: 'Teich'.


1275
01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:19.020
This is almost the
same angle we just had.

1276
01:38:19.604 --> 01:38:23.896
Forced laborers lived
down here by the pond.


1277
01:38:24.521 --> 01:38:27.729
And that was...
- Forbidden!


1278
01:38:27.896 --> 01:38:29.687
It looked like this.

1279
01:38:29.812 --> 01:38:33.938
Why were these people kept there?

1280
01:38:34.145 --> 01:38:36.562
Cengizhan just said it's forbidden.

1281
01:38:36.687 --> 01:38:38.229
What do you see there?

1282
01:38:38.354 --> 01:38:40.854
This man's flag.
- What's it called?


1283
01:38:40.979 --> 01:38:42.145
The swastika.

1284
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:44.729
Concentrate.
- What should I say?


1285
01:38:45.145 --> 01:38:48.312
Thea? - They were held there
because of Adolf Hitler.


1286
01:38:48.437 --> 01:38:52.479
So they would work for him
and build bombs and such.


1287
01:38:52.604 --> 01:38:57.812
There were a lot of these
camps in Stadtallendorf,


1288
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.521
that were involved in the
production of ammunition.


1289
01:39:04.395 --> 01:39:05.479
Is that a bomb?

1290
01:39:05.604 --> 01:39:06.938
That's ammunition.

1291
01:39:07.187 --> 01:39:09.896
Where exactly were the factories?

1292
01:39:10.103 --> 01:39:12.437
Where were those factories?

1293
01:39:13.646 --> 01:39:14.979
Cengizhan?
- DAG.


1294
01:39:15.103 --> 01:39:17.812
Excellent. D A G area.

1295
01:39:18.771 --> 01:39:23.354
How can you recognize
these factories today?


1296
01:39:23.938 --> 01:39:26.646
Carolin, you've seen such buildings before?

1297
01:39:26.771 --> 01:39:29.646
These houses have trees on their roofs.

1298
01:39:30.938 --> 01:39:33.145
That was camouflage.

1299
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:37.896
This is the "Münchmühle"...

1300
01:39:38.437 --> 01:39:41.103
Mem - o... What?
- Memorial.


1301
01:39:41.562 --> 01:39:43.103
Does anyone know it?

1302
01:41:26.854 --> 01:41:31.687
Back then it wasn't called
Stadtallendorf, but, yes? - Allendorf.


1303
01:41:31.854 --> 01:41:36.687
Allendorf, exactly.
A small half-timbered village.


1304
01:41:36.812 --> 01:41:38.479
1500 inhabitants.

1305
01:41:38.771 --> 01:41:41.187
Most of them were farmers.

1306
01:41:41.604 --> 01:41:44.938
Things changed dramatically around here

1307
01:41:45.062 --> 01:41:47.562
when the Nazis took over.

1308
01:41:47.687 --> 01:41:49.729
That was in 1933.

1309
01:41:50.187 --> 01:41:54.145
Shortly thereafter,
this piece of forest was chosen


1310
01:41:54.354 --> 01:41:59.729
as the site for two large
explosives factories.


1311
01:41:59.979 --> 01:42:04.687
Here you can see the different
factories with their abbreviations.


1312
01:42:05.103 --> 01:42:08.729
The WASAG, Westfälisch-Anhaltische
Sprengstoff AG,


1313
01:42:08.896 --> 01:42:10.229
marked in green.

1314
01:42:10.979 --> 01:42:12.576
And marked in yellow,

1315
01:42:13.182 --> 01:42:16.561
DAG, which stands for Dynamit
Aktien-Gesellschaft [Dynamite Corp.]


1316
01:42:16.938 --> 01:42:21.771
When the war broke out, workers
from all occupied countries in Europe


1317
01:42:21.896 --> 01:42:26.395
were brought to Germany as forced laborers.

1318
01:42:26.979 --> 01:42:30.729
In these two factories,
almost 17,000 people


1319
01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:33.479
from 22 countries were put to work.

1320
01:42:33.646 --> 01:42:36.979
And here you see those
countries, Belarus,... Do you...


1321
01:42:37.103 --> 01:42:39.771
Ukraine.
- Ukraine, exactly.


1322
01:42:39.896 --> 01:42:41.729
And Italy.
- And Italy.


1323
01:42:41.854 --> 01:42:43.938
Luxembourg, Belgium, Denmark.

1324
01:42:44.062 --> 01:42:45.812
Here you see women,

1325
01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:49.521
they had to fill this hot TNT,

1326
01:42:49.646 --> 01:42:51.145
the explosive,

1327
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:53.020
into the bomb shells.

1328
01:42:53.145 --> 01:42:58.020
They stirred the hot explosive
to get rid of any air bubbles.


1329
01:42:58.187 --> 01:43:01.479
You see how they stood
over the bomb openings.


1330
01:43:01.604 --> 01:43:04.229
That means they inhaled those vapors.

1331
01:43:04.354 --> 01:43:07.938
As you can imagine,
this wasn't exactly healthy.


1332
01:43:08.062 --> 01:43:10.103
There were thousands of people,

1333
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:12.729
and they all had to sleep somewhere.

1334
01:43:12.854 --> 01:43:16.354
So they built various
camps for this purpose.


1335
01:43:18.062 --> 01:43:22.354
The Nazis brought foreigners to Germany

1336
01:43:22.479 --> 01:43:26.145
but were prejudiced

1337
01:43:26.312 --> 01:43:28.562
and didn't treat them well.

1338
01:43:29.187 --> 01:43:32.187
Children and teenagers were also deployed.

1339
01:43:32.312 --> 01:43:36.103
70 children and teenagers
from Poland and Russia.


1340
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:38.854
Here's one of them.

1341
01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.938
His name is Adam Koslowski.

1342
01:43:41.062 --> 01:43:43.187
And when you look at this card

1343
01:43:43.312 --> 01:43:45.604
you'd think he was a criminal.

1344
01:43:45.729 --> 01:43:50.312
Because of the fingerprints and
the ID number he's holding.


1345
01:43:50.437 --> 01:43:52.521
It's very important to note

1346
01:43:52.646 --> 01:43:55.229
that all the children and teenagers

1347
01:43:55.354 --> 01:43:59.103
were from Poland, 
Russia and Belarus.

1348
01:43:59.479 --> 01:44:01.854
No French or Dutch children.

1349
01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:04.312
Only children from Eastern Europe

1350
01:44:04.437 --> 01:44:09.354
because in the Nazis' view
they were at the very bottom.


1351
01:44:09.771 --> 01:44:12.521
REFUGEES, DEPORTATIONS, IMMIGRATION

1352
01:44:12.979 --> 01:44:17.687
Here's the 2nd room of our exhibition.
It's about the postwar period.


1353
01:44:17.812 --> 01:44:23.187
It shows how the people needed
work to be able to live.


1354
01:44:23.354 --> 01:44:27.646
So they decided to repurpose

1355
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:31.562
the DAG facilities.

1356
01:44:31.687 --> 01:44:35.187
Instead of producing explosives,

1357
01:44:35.312 --> 01:44:40.020
they would produce other
products for everyday needs.


1358
01:44:41.062 --> 01:44:44.812
What was destroyed or lost in the war

1359
01:44:44.938 --> 01:44:49.604
was later produced by various
companies here in Allendorf.


1360
01:45:10.562 --> 01:45:15.312
This part is about the companies
that are still flourishing here.


1361
01:45:15.604 --> 01:45:17.479
Ferrero.
- Right, Ferrero.


1362
01:45:17.687 --> 01:45:18.729
Ferrero.

1363
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:22.437
They weren't called
Ferrero back then, but...


1364
01:45:22.562 --> 01:45:24.354
Assia.
- Assia, exactly.


1365
01:45:24.479 --> 01:45:27.270
Assia is Italian for Hesse.

1366
01:45:27.479 --> 01:45:32.437
In this large picture you can see how
harsh the working conditions were


1367
01:45:32.562 --> 01:45:36.187
in the company shown here.
Which company is this?


1368
01:45:37.103 --> 01:45:38.437
Yes?
- Winter.


1369
01:45:38.562 --> 01:45:40.896
Right, the Fritz Winter company.

1370
01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.479
People had to work very, very hard there.

1371
01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:48.896
In the 1950's, a lot of them didn't
want to work there any more.


1372
01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:51.229
Better jobs were available elsewhere.

1373
01:45:51.354 --> 01:45:54.646
So the company owner,
Winter, went to Istanbul,


1374
01:45:54.771 --> 01:45:56.979
and hired Turkish workers there.

1375
01:45:58.229 --> 01:46:00.729
Is it spicy? I think it's Jamie's.

1376
01:46:01.771 --> 01:46:05.646
Jamie, you wanted spicy, right?
- We have 3 lahmacuns.


1377
01:46:40.646 --> 01:46:42.020
Hey, Jamie!

1378
01:46:42.437 --> 01:46:45.854
There's no meat in falafels, right?
- That's rice.


1379
01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:53.312
Why are you guys ragging
on me the whole time?


1380
01:47:10.562 --> 01:47:12.187
Mr. Bachmann, I'm stuffed.

1381
01:47:14.646 --> 01:47:16.812
Then take it home to your little sister.

1382
01:47:16.938 --> 01:47:18.312
Why's she crying?

1383
01:47:18.812 --> 01:47:22.020
Stefi, go over to Ferhan.

1384
01:47:28.854 --> 01:47:30.896
Mr. Bachmann, Ferhan's crying.

1385
01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:34.103
Take your seats!

1386
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:37.270
I want 2 minutes of total silence!

1387
01:47:38.729 --> 01:47:40.938
What happened, Ferhan?

1388
01:47:41.312 --> 01:47:45.562
I'm here. What happened?
Do you know what happened?


1389
01:47:45.687 --> 01:47:49.270
She was fighting with Stefi
but I don't know what about.


1390
01:47:49.687 --> 01:47:52.312
Where's Stefi?
- I know what happened.


1391
01:47:52.437 --> 01:47:54.521
Did you understand the Turkish...

1392
01:47:54.646 --> 01:47:56.771
Did I ask you?

1393
01:47:58.562 --> 01:48:00.312
Hey, I'm looking at you!

1394
01:48:00.437 --> 01:48:02.437
Did I ask you?

1395
01:48:02.562 --> 01:48:04.729
I said no talking!

1396
01:48:05.562 --> 01:48:08.979
Mr. Bachmann, I just said Ferhan's
going to this new mosque.


1397
01:48:09.103 --> 01:48:10.312
No yelling!

1398
01:48:11.103 --> 01:48:15.687
And she's crying, what did I say...
- We don't yell around here!


1399
01:48:18.604 --> 01:48:22.604
When I ask you something you may
answer calmly, but I haven't asked yet.


1400
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:25.771
First I want Ferhan to
tell me what's going on.


1401
01:48:25.896 --> 01:48:27.604
Ferhan, can you tell me?

1402
01:48:28.312 --> 01:48:29.521
Huh?

1403
01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:31.145
Just tell me.

1404
01:48:32.312 --> 01:48:34.437
Very softly. I'll hear it.

1405
01:48:34.562 --> 01:48:36.103
What's wrong?

1406
01:48:37.896 --> 01:48:41.646
I know Ferhan.
She's like a snail when she's upset.


1407
01:48:41.771 --> 01:48:44.521
I didn't...
- I'm not talking to you!


1408
01:48:45.437 --> 01:48:48.103
Then she's like a snail, retreats and...

1409
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:49.729
She insulted me!

1410
01:48:49.854 --> 01:48:51.229
Get out!

1411
01:48:53.687 --> 01:48:54.896
I'm going home.

1412
01:49:01.979 --> 01:49:04.729
Come over here! 
Come sit in this chair!

1413
01:49:04.854 --> 01:49:06.854
I only said in front of Cengizhan,

1414
01:49:06.959 --> 01:49:10.842
"Cengizhan, you and Ilknur
go in Fatih Mosque.


1415
01:49:10.959 --> 01:49:14.182
And Ferhan goes in new mosque."

1416
01:49:14.395 --> 01:49:17.562
And she says,
"Why do you only talk about me?


1417
01:49:17.687 --> 01:49:18.687
And such.

1418
01:49:18.854 --> 01:49:21.062
I'm not like a...

1419
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:22.395
the one...

1420
01:49:24.938 --> 01:49:27.979
a ..." I don't know
what it's called in German.


1421
01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:30.938
Go inside, Jamie!
- "Victim" or something like that.


1422
01:49:31.896 --> 01:49:34.062
That's what she said?
- Yes!


1423
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:36.521
And I... I didn't insult her.

1424
01:49:36.646 --> 01:49:38.479
No, I never said you did.

1425
01:49:38.687 --> 01:49:43.062
Could you now calmly talk
to Ferhan and Ilknur?


1426
01:49:43.687 --> 01:49:47.229
It's a misunderstanding.
You didn't insult her, right?


1427
01:49:47.395 --> 01:49:50.854
What you said triggered
something inside of her.


1428
01:49:50.979 --> 01:49:52.521
Do you understand?
- Yes


1429
01:49:52.646 --> 01:49:57.395
Something that had nothing to do
with what you wanted to say.


1430
01:49:58.145 --> 01:50:00.812
Would you do that
for me? Talk to her?

1431
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:35.771
You've got the chisel now
and he's gonna hit it.


1432
01:50:35.896 --> 01:50:37.479
Is it swollen?
- Yes.


1433
01:50:37.604 --> 01:50:39.354
Where?
- Here.


1434
01:50:39.479 --> 01:50:42.562
But only here, right?
- No, here...


1435
01:50:42.687 --> 01:50:46.979
Go upstairs and hold it
under cold, running water.


1436
01:50:47.145 --> 01:50:48.604
Okay?
- Okay.


1437
01:50:48.812 --> 01:50:50.395
Wait a second!

1438
01:50:50.521 --> 01:50:53.312
You'll have to do it on your own now.
- Me?


1439
01:50:53.437 --> 01:50:55.604
Yes. Like this.

1440
01:51:04.687 --> 01:51:07.812
Ayman, you're doing it wrong.
Come over here!


1441
01:51:07.979 --> 01:51:09.229
Come here!

1442
01:51:11.103 --> 01:51:13.229
Come here, Raffaele! Raffaele!

1443
01:51:14.687 --> 01:51:16.854
If you take the chisel...
Hold this.


1444
01:51:17.312 --> 01:51:19.187
Give me a hammer.

1445
01:51:21.896 --> 01:51:23.687
If you hold the chisel...

1446
01:51:24.854 --> 01:51:27.604
up here then you'll hit your hand.

1447
01:51:27.938 --> 01:51:32.103
But if you hold it down
here that won't happen.


1448
01:51:38.437 --> 01:51:43.062
Ayman! You're doing it right but
you're working the top edge.


1449
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:44.479
Look at me.

1450
01:51:44.604 --> 01:51:47.562
It's better to hold
the chisel at an angle.

1451
01:51:50.979 --> 01:51:52.395
That's really good!

1452
01:51:58.979 --> 01:52:01.812
That's still a work in progress, right?
- Yes.


1453
01:52:01.938 --> 01:52:04.062
It's not such a nice stone.

1454
01:52:04.187 --> 01:52:06.229
Yeah, it's got some flaws.

1455
01:52:06.604 --> 01:52:08.771
It's got a lot of clay in it.

1456
01:52:08.896 --> 01:52:12.521
But this one's quite nice, huh?
- I don't know.


1457
01:52:12.646 --> 01:52:16.562
When adults work intensely on something,

1458
01:52:17.646 --> 01:52:21.729
like you chiseling your
stone very intensely,


1459
01:52:21.896 --> 01:52:26.020
then that inspires others
to work like that too.


1460
01:52:26.145 --> 01:52:29.229
No, that's not true.
- It's not? - No.


1461
01:52:31.062 --> 01:52:36.604
I used to join them [students], but then
they were too afraid to do anything.


1462
01:52:36.729 --> 01:52:39.187
I know that from school.

1463
01:52:39.312 --> 01:52:42.604
When I play something
complicated on my guitar,


1464
01:52:42.729 --> 01:52:44.896
it doesn't encourage them at all.

1465
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:50.687
But like with any learning process, it's
also about finding your own way, right?


1466
01:52:50.812 --> 01:52:54.229
Yeah, it's the most important
thing, I suppose for teachers too.


1467
01:52:54.395 --> 01:52:56.771
I studied to become a teacher in Berlin.

1468
01:52:57.771 --> 01:53:02.479
I started studying sociology, but
didn't know what I'd do with it,


1469
01:53:02.604 --> 01:53:05.145
so I switched to teaching.

1470
01:53:05.729 --> 01:53:08.771
But why did I become a teacher?

1471
01:53:09.687 --> 01:53:11.812
In the end it was because,

1472
01:53:11.979 --> 01:53:17.145
my wife and I,
we were together for 15 years,


1473
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:22.187
we had two children,
and she didn't have a steady job.


1474
01:53:22.437 --> 01:53:27.020
Someone had to make a living,
so I was the one who did that.


1475
01:53:27.479 --> 01:53:31.812
That's how I got into teaching.

1476
01:53:32.103 --> 01:53:36.437
I kinda resisted it for
a pretty long time...


1477
01:53:37.938 --> 01:53:39.354
because...

1478
01:53:40.437 --> 01:53:43.521
the school as an institution

1479
01:53:43.646 --> 01:53:47.354
alienated me right from the start.
It still does.


1480
01:53:49.062 --> 01:53:51.896
I couldn't imagine,

1481
01:53:52.062 --> 01:53:54.270
that I wouldn't get chucked out.

1482
01:53:57.896 --> 01:54:01.938
You were like the E.T. among teachers.
- Yeah, in a way.


1483
01:54:02.896 --> 01:54:04.395
But, yeah...

1484
01:54:04.812 --> 01:54:09.604
When I was in my mid-40's
I thought about quitting. I can't do this.


1485
01:54:10.187 --> 01:54:14.604
When you have the feeling

1486
01:54:14.729 --> 01:54:17.562
that you can't really shape anything,

1487
01:54:17.729 --> 01:54:21.312
but are always at odds,

1488
01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:25.020
that you practically have
to chain down the kids


1489
01:54:25.145 --> 01:54:27.729
so they don't toss you into the mud.

1490
01:54:27.854 --> 01:54:33.187
It also had a lot
to do with my past.

1491
01:54:34.312 --> 01:54:39.812
I didn't want to be such a
teacher, such a person.


1492
01:54:39.938 --> 01:54:43.521
But at some point it went click,

1493
01:54:43.687 --> 01:54:45.896
and I realized that

1494
01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:49.604
the dressage I had
to do day after day

1495
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:52.270
was now only about 10% of the work.

1496
01:54:52.395 --> 01:54:56.312
And the rest, like when we were here,

1497
01:54:56.437 --> 01:54:59.270
is somehow meaningful.

1498
01:54:59.479 --> 01:55:02.854
And now I get a lot in return.

1499
01:55:04.103 --> 01:55:07.812
From some a lot, from
others less or nothing at all.


1500
01:55:07.938 --> 01:55:09.687
But on the whole...

1501
01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:15.229
Sometimes I get a bit uneasy because
I feel like I should push them harder,


1502
01:55:15.354 --> 01:55:18.479
we should be doing more math and German.

1503
01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:23.395
Then I have an attack and feel horrible

1504
01:55:23.521 --> 01:55:28.229
because I'm not working with
the kids but against them.


1505
01:55:28.354 --> 01:55:30.896
Just shoving things down their throats.

1506
01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.103
And in the end it's pointless.

1507
01:55:33.979 --> 01:55:36.187
But this happens sometimes.

1508
01:55:36.395 --> 01:55:39.979
Because I wonder what are they
actually learning from juggling,


1509
01:55:40.103 --> 01:55:41.938
or playing drums all day?

1510
01:55:46.687 --> 01:55:49.479
That's how I do
it with my courses too.

1511
01:55:49.604 --> 01:55:52.979
The first thing I do is
lower their expectations.


1512
01:55:53.145 --> 01:55:56.938
Some people come with a Käthe
Kollwitz figure and say:


1513
01:55:57.062 --> 01:55:59.020
I'd like to carve this in stone.

1514
01:55:59.145 --> 01:56:04.604
Then I ask them who they think they are,
that they could carve such a figure


1515
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:08.229
after watching for an hour or so.

1516
01:56:09.437 --> 01:56:12.229
What about anatomy and all that?

1517
01:56:12.896 --> 01:56:15.312
So I bring them all the way down,

1518
01:56:15.437 --> 01:56:18.229
and teach them how to
carve edges and stuff.


1519
01:56:18.354 --> 01:56:22.938
What I never liked about sculpting
is that you're always alone.


1520
01:56:23.812 --> 01:56:29.771
And I think that's also the
reason why I stuck to teaching.


1521
01:56:30.103 --> 01:56:34.604
Working with the kids
does me good. I enjoy it.


1522
01:56:36.854 --> 01:56:39.103
Mr. Bachmann, I need to go home!

1523
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:40.729
Go get that note.

1524
01:56:40.854 --> 01:56:44.187
So, while Virat's still here

1525
01:56:44.312 --> 01:56:49.646
I wanted to really begin this project
describe an image.


1526
01:56:49.812 --> 01:56:51.479
What kind of project is this?

1527
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:55.771
They're basically making a picture
using collage techniques.


1528
01:56:55.896 --> 01:56:57.979
Mr. Bachmann, Leonie's crying.
- Huh?


1529
01:56:58.103 --> 01:57:01.270
Leonie's crying.
- Yeah, go... I'll be right there.


1530
01:57:02.729 --> 01:57:04.521
Ah, here! Martin!

1531
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:06.187
Look!

1532
01:57:10.062 --> 01:57:15.062
Not just one picture. You should combine
several and also draw something.


1533
01:57:15.187 --> 01:57:19.103
I have two pictures. - Then make
something and we'll talk about it.


1534
01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:21.187
Do you have to
leave it as it is?

1535
01:57:21.354 --> 01:57:23.229
No, you can also change it.

1536
01:57:23.395 --> 01:57:25.020
How do you do that?

1537
01:57:25.145 --> 01:57:27.979
Well, you can draw a teacher here.

1538
01:57:28.145 --> 01:57:31.020
A real one.
- Or cut one out.


1539
01:57:31.229 --> 01:57:33.938
Who fell over because it was too loud.

1540
01:57:35.145 --> 01:57:37.312
Like happens to me once a week.

1541
01:57:37.437 --> 01:57:40.604
But you don't fall over
because you're strong. - Sure.


1542
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:44.938
Mr. Bachmann, I'm really fond of you.
- We're talking about the picture here.


1543
01:57:45.062 --> 01:57:48.354
Stick to the point!
- Look this is our principal...


1544
01:57:48.479 --> 01:57:51.896
Looks just like him!
- And here in his eyes are cameras


1545
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:55.437
and he's always checking
what they're doing.


1546
01:57:55.562 --> 01:57:57.687
A surveillance camera?
- Exactly.


1547
01:58:07.854 --> 01:58:09.270
Ronja, look!

1548
01:58:09.395 --> 01:58:10.521
Look.

1549
01:58:11.729 --> 01:58:12.938
Oh, Rabia...

1550
01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:19.229
So what would you like to see now?

1551
01:58:19.562 --> 01:58:21.938
Where's all this leading?

1552
01:58:22.646 --> 01:58:26.395
That I can keep going to
school without any problems.


1553
01:58:26.979 --> 01:58:29.187
That me and my mother...

1554
01:58:29.312 --> 01:58:30.979
I mean, my brother...

1555
01:58:31.479 --> 01:58:35.437
That my brother, my mother and
I can live together again.


1556
01:58:35.562 --> 01:58:37.437
That I can see my dad.

1557
01:58:37.562 --> 01:58:41.646
That we're close. That I'll stay
with my mom and visit my dad.


1558
01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:43.938
Keep going to school here.

1559
01:58:44.437 --> 01:58:46.896
I want to be an interior designer.

1560
01:58:52.646 --> 01:58:55.562
I've had a headache the past few days.

1561
01:58:56.521 --> 01:58:59.312
I understand. I would too.

1562
01:58:59.437 --> 01:59:03.020
That's why I fall asleep so much
because I can't sleep at home.


1563
01:59:03.145 --> 01:59:07.312
You can sleep a bit here.
Go lie on the couch if you want.


1564
01:59:07.437 --> 01:59:10.395
You want to? Go
lie down on the couch.

1565
01:59:33.354 --> 01:59:35.812
What a nice idea, Ilknur.

1566
01:59:36.062 --> 01:59:38.896
To go around and show everyone that.

1567
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:48.312
Hasan, go out and ask Cengiz
if he's got the story.


1568
01:59:48.437 --> 01:59:52.896
He can come back in.
- I've got my story but not the picture.


1569
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:55.729
Well, I don't have it. I'm positive.

1570
01:59:59.938 --> 02:00:03.395
Hey, I'm gonna throw out everybody
who's not paying attention!


1571
02:00:03.521 --> 02:00:05.020
It's Ferhan's turn.

1572
02:00:05.145 --> 02:00:08.604
You guys back there had your turn, Jamie.
- I'm listening.


1573
02:00:08.896 --> 02:00:10.562
Put the pen away.

1574
02:00:12.354 --> 02:00:16.103
Mr. Bachmann, is it okay if
I hold it in my hand? - Yes.


1575
02:00:17.854 --> 02:00:20.437
But face the audience, if possible.

1576
02:00:21.312 --> 02:00:23.938
My title is: The dogs and the cats.

1577
02:00:24.312 --> 02:00:28.354
Once upon a time there was a dog.
She had baby cats.


1578
02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:31.312
And then the owner...
- A dog that had baby cats?


1579
02:00:31.437 --> 02:00:33.020
Baby dogs!

1580
02:00:35.896 --> 02:00:38.812
And then the owner said to the children

1581
02:00:38.938 --> 02:00:41.270
that the dog had baby dogs.

1582
02:00:41.395 --> 02:00:42.562
Then the bab...

1583
02:00:42.687 --> 02:00:45.437
Then the children quickly ran and

1584
02:00:46.187 --> 02:00:50.354
put them to a box. 
And took them home.

1585
02:00:50.479 --> 02:00:54.938
And the cat was looking so sad
because the children find the dogs cute.


1586
02:00:55.103 --> 02:01:00.771
But the cat thinks that the children
like the dogs more than the cat and then...


1587
02:01:04.312 --> 02:01:09.062
then one child looked to cat and
saw that the cat was looking sad


1588
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:10.646
and went to cat,

1589
02:01:10.771 --> 02:01:15.646
said that it love cat and
then the cat said, "Meow."


1590
02:01:16.604 --> 02:01:19.479
Then child take

1591
02:01:19.604 --> 02:01:24.354
the cat to his hand and
brought the cat to dogs.


1592
02:01:24.479 --> 02:01:29.020
"These are ours new baby dogs.
They look very cute, don't they?"


1593
02:01:29.145 --> 02:01:33.312
said the child, then the cat meowed again.

1594
02:01:33.687 --> 02:01:37.938
Then the cat and the children
and dog were all happy.


1595
02:01:38.187 --> 02:01:41.938
And then dog said,
"bow-wow", meaning it barked.


1596
02:01:42.187 --> 02:01:46.395
Hmmm. Yeah, quite good sto...

1597
02:01:46.562 --> 02:01:48.270
Did you raise your hand?

1598
02:01:49.395 --> 02:01:52.729
May I say something, Mr. Bachmann?
- Yes, Ilknur.


1599
02:01:52.854 --> 02:01:57.854
So, everyone should really listen now.
Cengizhan and the others too.


1600
02:01:57.979 --> 02:02:03.145
First, raise your hand and then talk.
Second, respect childrens too.


1601
02:02:03.562 --> 02:02:07.938
Third, if you don't have any respect,
then you can read some books.


1602
02:02:08.062 --> 02:02:11.145
They have a lot of information
about respect, okay?


1603
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:14.062
Yeah, take this to heart!

1604
02:02:14.187 --> 02:02:18.312
You can go right back out. Go!
If you don't wanna participate.


1605
02:02:18.437 --> 02:02:20.812
I'm not a puppet.
You can't play around with me!


1606
02:02:20.938 --> 02:02:23.437
No one wants to play with you!
- You're playing with us.


1607
02:02:23.562 --> 02:02:25.062
Yeah, yeah, we'll see!

1608
02:02:29.854 --> 02:02:32.938
Anastasia, what do you think
about what Ilknur just said?


1609
02:02:33.103 --> 02:02:35.062
Good.
- Excuse me? - Good.


1610
02:02:35.479 --> 02:02:37.354
I agree.

1611
02:02:37.771 --> 02:02:40.812
But that goes for you
back there a bit too.

1612
02:02:40.938 --> 02:02:43.437
You weren't listening to Ferhan either.

1613
02:02:43.562 --> 02:02:47.854
Ayman, I know you want to say
her language wasn't always correct.


1614
02:02:47.979 --> 02:02:49.604
But that's okay.

1615
02:02:50.437 --> 02:02:52.521
Do you have any ideas?

1616
02:02:52.646 --> 02:02:57.521
How can we improve the story?
I liked Ferhan's story very much.


1617
02:02:57.646 --> 02:02:59.646
It was also very detailed.

1618
02:02:59.771 --> 02:03:04.437
She just made a few
grammatical and syntax errors.


1619
02:03:04.562 --> 02:03:07.229
Any ideas how you could help her?

1620
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:11.687
Couldn't you imagine sitting
down with her and... - No!


1621
02:03:11.812 --> 02:03:13.395
No? Why not?

1622
02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.896
Why not?
- I don't know, I can't.


1623
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.395
Why not?

1624
02:03:21.437 --> 02:03:22.687
I don't know.

1625
02:03:22.812 --> 02:03:27.729
I'll wait for your explanation.
We've still got two whole hours.


1626
02:03:27.896 --> 02:03:32.604
Then we'll just wait two hours.
But I want an honest explanation.


1627
02:03:32.729 --> 02:03:34.687
That's part of it.

1628
02:03:36.395 --> 02:03:40.187
What am I supposed to say?
- You know what you want to say.


1629
02:03:41.395 --> 02:03:44.395
Just say it! You can be honest.
- Eh, what?


1630
02:03:44.562 --> 02:03:47.062
I'll tell you my opinion too,

1631
02:03:47.187 --> 02:03:51.395
but just say it. Why can't you
help Ferhan revise her story?


1632
02:03:52.312 --> 02:03:54.938
I mean, you're quite good in German.

1633
02:03:56.062 --> 02:03:58.270
Just because she's a girl?

1634
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:05.020
I don't get it! What has Ferhan did to you?
- because we're not so dense.


1635
02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:08.395
Then why don't you help...
- Let him talk, Ilknur!


1636
02:04:08.521 --> 02:04:11.979
You think we're bullying her
cause we don't like her, huh?


1637
02:04:12.103 --> 02:04:14.187
But there's always some reason or other.

1638
02:04:14.312 --> 02:04:18.312
Okay, I'm not doing it...
You know, I like her but...


1639
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:21.270
no contact, so...

1640
02:04:21.562 --> 02:04:26.395
But I don't think it's very brave of
him [Ayman] to just say he won't do it.


1641
02:04:26.521 --> 02:04:30.229
I don't want to either.
- You're trying to explain why,


1642
02:04:30.354 --> 02:04:33.437
but you didn't. 
I don't like that.

1643
02:04:33.562 --> 02:04:36.229
Ilknur said I can't stand Ferhan.

1644
02:04:36.354 --> 02:04:39.729
That's not true. I like her okay.
- Some people are like that.


1645
02:04:39.854 --> 02:04:42.979
Shhh! Let him talk!
- Some people, not me.


1646
02:04:44.562 --> 02:04:46.145
I don't know...

1647
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:51.103
Thea Lucia said you can't
just because she's a girl.


1648
02:04:51.604 --> 02:04:53.145
No.

1649
02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:58.729
It depends on the situation.

1650
02:05:00.771 --> 02:05:05.187
Sometimes I can help a little
when I know how...


1651
02:05:05.354 --> 02:05:07.103
to do it myself. But...

1652
02:05:08.729 --> 02:05:13.687
here I also have problems and...

1653
02:05:13.812 --> 02:05:16.437
I didn't really understand the story.

1654
02:05:16.562 --> 02:05:18.979
Then you don't know how to help.

1655
02:05:19.103 --> 02:05:21.604
You feel overwhelmed?
- Yes.


1656
02:05:21.729 --> 02:05:25.896
I don't quite believe you
but I'm gonna take it seriously.


1657
02:05:26.145 --> 02:05:29.521
How long have you been here at school?

1658
02:05:29.646 --> 02:05:32.896
17 years. My longest relationship.

1659
02:05:33.771 --> 02:05:35.437
With the school!

1660
02:05:35.604 --> 02:05:40.103
Let's see how you survive separation.
A lot a people are leaving now.


1661
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:44.521
It'll be interesting to see who
makes a row when you're gone.


1662
02:05:44.646 --> 02:05:48.270
You think somebody has to
take over my role? How 'bout you?


1663
02:05:48.395 --> 02:05:50.312
I can't fill your shoes.

1664
02:05:51.312 --> 02:05:54.729
The kids grow up so fast.
Just look at that picture.


1665
02:05:54.854 --> 02:05:57.812
Of Elias?
- Of Elias and Hannes.


1666
02:06:00.145 --> 02:06:03.354
When I look in the mirror in
the morning I think,


1667
02:06:03.479 --> 02:06:06.437
Oh God, old fart, old fart!

1668
02:06:07.103 --> 02:06:10.812
But I think all the kids in
Stadtallendorf are brave.


1669
02:06:10.938 --> 02:06:15.604
I used to give swimming
lessons at the old pool.


1670
02:06:15.771 --> 02:06:21.854
They all dove from the 3m
diving board. Totally fearless.


1671
02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:26.062
You had to make sure they didn't
break one another's neck.


1672
02:06:26.187 --> 02:06:29.270
They would've jumped from
the 10m platform too.


1673
02:06:29.479 --> 02:06:31.562
I'm one of them too.
- Yeah.


1674
02:06:31.687 --> 02:06:34.020
Well...
- I have...


1675
02:06:34.187 --> 02:06:37.312
You've been Germanized.
- Germanized? Yeah.


1676
02:06:38.395 --> 02:06:41.229
Though I'm the only Turk, you know?

1677
02:06:41.354 --> 02:06:45.646
Yes.
- The only one with Turkish citizenship.


1678
02:06:45.771 --> 02:06:48.395
You have dual...
- Yes, I also have Turkish...


1679
02:06:48.521 --> 02:06:52.521
Everyone's always saying, "I'm Turkish!"
but they're German citizens.


1680
02:06:52.646 --> 02:06:56.187
I've never really
understood dual citizenship.


1681
02:06:56.312 --> 02:06:59.312
I became a German citizen before '98.

1682
02:07:00.771 --> 02:07:02.729
Because of my dad back then.

1683
02:07:02.854 --> 02:07:07.145
Because he was persecuted. - Yeah,
at some point they sent him a funny letter:


1684
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:10.312
You may now become a Turkish citizen again.

1685
02:07:10.437 --> 02:07:13.646
He didn't want to?
- No. Why would he?


1686
02:07:13.771 --> 02:07:17.604
I'm your dad's age.
I somehow heard about it back then


1687
02:07:17.729 --> 02:07:20.812
from some students in Berlin.

1688
02:07:20.938 --> 02:07:23.103
They said students

1689
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:26.604
were shot in bed in their dorms.

1690
02:07:26.729 --> 02:07:30.312
Yeah, Papa tells some
crazy stories sometimes.


1691
02:07:30.938 --> 02:07:35.771
How the police stormed the dorms
and clobbered everyone.


1692
02:07:38.687 --> 02:07:39.979
Yeah.

1693
02:07:40.103 --> 02:07:41.604
Yes.

1694
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:45.896
And now we have a similar situation here.
- Hmm.


1695
02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:49.771
That the police run
around and beat people up.


1696
02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:54.687
The whole Gezi Park demonstrations.
- Hmm.


1697
02:07:54.812 --> 02:07:57.062
And now...

1698
02:07:58.395 --> 02:08:03.103
Vacation in Turkey? I don't think
it's going to happen this year.


1699
02:08:05.437 --> 02:08:07.437
Even though I'd like to but...

1700
02:08:07.562 --> 02:08:09.938
I've never been to Turkey.

1701
02:08:10.062 --> 02:08:12.562
I'll take you with me someday.
You'll like it.


1702
02:08:12.687 --> 02:08:16.229
You have a house there, right?
- Yeah, we'll go together. - Nice.


1703
02:08:16.354 --> 02:08:20.938
On the Black Sea. - And there aren't
any jerks around there? - No...


1704
02:08:21.062 --> 02:08:23.646
Right on the Black Sea?
- Right on the Black Sea.


1705
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:27.395
I've never had to face discrimination.
It's always been the others.


1706
02:08:27.521 --> 02:08:31.729
Like you: "Caraway Turk" or "German
-Turk",

1707
02:08:31.854 --> 02:08:36.354
or whatever. Now I've been
discriminated against. - How?


1708
02:08:37.479 --> 02:08:40.187
I'm the oldest one in the kids group!

1709
02:08:41.145 --> 02:08:47.145
I come to the parent-teacher conference
and not a bloody soul wants to talk to me.


1710
02:08:47.562 --> 02:08:49.979
I had the feeling

1711
02:08:50.145 --> 02:08:53.103
they think it sucks that I'm
such an old father.


1712
02:08:53.229 --> 02:08:55.103
It was different with Elias.

1713
02:08:55.354 --> 02:08:57.395
Now I sit there,

1714
02:08:57.604 --> 02:09:01.729
and everyone behind me is
at least 20-25 years younger.


1715
02:09:02.354 --> 02:09:04.395
And they look at me like

1716
02:09:04.979 --> 02:09:08.145
some kind of extinct dinosaur or something.

1717
02:09:08.312 --> 02:09:10.812
It's the opposite with us.
I'm the youngest.


1718
02:09:10.938 --> 02:09:13.604
I don't see you as some 60-year-old.

1719
02:09:13.729 --> 02:09:16.145
I was surprised to hear you're leaving.

1720
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:18.103
Huh? Dieter's leaving already?

1721
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:21.229
Why's he retiring?

1722
02:09:21.437 --> 02:09:26.020
That was the 1st time I thought:
Oh, Dieter's over 60.


1723
02:09:27.145 --> 02:09:31.020
I'm not over 60. I'll be 65
in two weeks, you joker!


1724
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:34.103
Have you ever noticed how
people you see every day,


1725
02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:37.979
you no longer see what they look like?
- I know what you mean.


1726
02:09:38.187 --> 02:09:43.395
That's why being with a beautiful woman is
overrated because you don't even notice it anymore.


1727
02:09:51.812 --> 02:09:55.562
Only for you to embrace love.

1728
02:09:56.896 --> 02:10:00.646
Through the night and
the thickest branches.


1729
02:10:02.187 --> 02:10:06.187
So all your fears disappear,

1730
02:10:06.896 --> 02:10:10.687
And when a song leaves my lips,

1731
02:10:12.145 --> 02:10:16.103
then only for you to embrace love.

1732
02:10:17.062 --> 02:10:21.187
Through the night and
the thickest branches.


1733
02:10:22.646 --> 02:10:26.270
So all your fears disappear,

1734
02:10:26.812 --> 02:10:30.938
Through the night and
the thickest branches.


1735
02:10:32.395 --> 02:10:35.854
So all your fears disappear,

1736
02:10:37.437 --> 02:10:41.020
So all your fears disappear.

1737
02:10:42.103 --> 02:10:44.604
Oh, Hasan, superstar Hasan!

1738
02:10:47.395 --> 02:10:49.479
Is that F?
- Yes, you can...


1739
02:10:49.604 --> 02:10:50.687
With the 2...

1740
02:10:50.812 --> 02:10:53.354
Press down the 2 with your index finger,

1741
02:10:53.479 --> 02:10:56.103
then place your little finger here.

1742
02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:02.187
And when a song leaves my lips,

1743
02:11:02.312 --> 02:11:06.229
then only for you to embrace love. Okay?

1744
02:11:07.521 --> 02:11:10.354
Can you add some suspense to the title?

1745
02:11:10.479 --> 02:11:12.479
Yes.
- Then read us your title.


1746
02:11:12.604 --> 02:11:14.979
Once upon a time there
was a man and a cat.

1747
02:11:15.103 --> 02:11:19.229
That raises expectations. And then...
- I have one, too! - Stefi!


1748
02:11:19.395 --> 02:11:22.354
Big Love.
- Oh, that sounds exciting!


1749
02:11:22.479 --> 02:11:24.773
"Once upon a time in a village,

1750
02:11:25.081 --> 02:11:26.211
there were two lovers.

1751
02:11:26.555 --> 02:11:29.152
They loved each other
so much until one day,


1752
02:11:29.263 --> 02:11:35.045
then the witch said there was
no true love in the land.


1753
02:11:36.317 --> 02:11:37.336
Then one day,

1754
02:11:37.421 --> 02:11:40.746
the witch went home.

1755
02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:43.806
And she told them the witch

1756
02:11:43.922 --> 02:11:46.657
would one day put poison in their food.

1757
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:52.634
Then one of them would
become ugly and they separate.


1758
02:11:52.823 --> 02:11:54.782
They were really frightened.

1759
02:11:55.302 --> 02:11:57.243
Day came.

1760
02:11:57.438 --> 02:12:00.446
She put the poison in the food.

1761
02:12:00.641 --> 02:12:02.413
Then it was mealtime.

1762
02:12:02.686 --> 02:12:05.850
They came to the table. And so one."

1763
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:11.187
You've been here less than a year and you're
already writing such a great story in German.


1764
02:12:11.354 --> 02:12:14.312
And now as a
challenge, just like in math,

1765
02:12:14.437 --> 02:12:17.437
the first one to present
his story and picture


1766
02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:21.020
will get a half a grade bonus point.

1767
02:12:21.187 --> 02:12:24.437
Do you have to write
the story on a poster?

1768
02:12:24.562 --> 02:12:25.979
Yes.

1769
02:12:26.103 --> 02:12:29.437
Looks like "chocolate".
Shocked is with 'ck'.


1770
02:12:29.562 --> 02:12:31.437
Not 'chocolify'.

1771
02:12:45.437 --> 02:12:48.229
The Brave Dog

1772
02:12:49.145 --> 02:12:51.103
Oh, no! It doesn't fit.

1773
02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:59.854
But she kissed him and
he was back to normal.


1774
02:12:59.979 --> 02:13:01.145
Okay.
- Happy end.


1775
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:06.312
Happy end, yes...
- You can also write it in red.


1776
02:13:12.103 --> 02:13:15.103
A grade and the reason, Rabia!

1777
02:13:15.729 --> 02:13:18.771
A 'B' because the poster is very beautiful.

1778
02:13:18.896 --> 02:13:23.270
And the story is also very beautiful.
And because it's with love.


1779
02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:26.229
She also didn't make language mistakes.

1780
02:13:26.354 --> 02:13:28.479
It's pretty good for German.

1781
02:13:28.604 --> 02:13:32.771
I'd also give her a 'B'
because I think nobody else


1782
02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:35.187
wrote a love story besides Stefi.

1783
02:13:35.771 --> 02:13:39.187
Her poster also matches well.

1784
02:13:39.354 --> 02:13:42.145
Like the color. 
And the story is also good.

1785
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:45.312
What grade would you give yourself and why?

1786
02:13:45.771 --> 02:13:48.354
I don't know. This is...

1787
02:13:48.479 --> 02:13:50.896
Just be honest, like you always are.

1788
02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:53.395
A 'C'.
- A 'C'?


1789
02:13:54.187 --> 02:13:55.729
Why?

1790
02:13:57.062 --> 02:14:00.187
Your poster is beautiful.

1791
02:14:00.312 --> 02:14:02.354
What could you've done better?

1792
02:14:02.479 --> 02:14:05.604
Yes, poster is beautiful but I...

1793
02:14:05.729 --> 02:14:08.312
read... the story so...

1794
02:14:08.521 --> 02:14:11.562
Yes, but you haven't been
in Germany very long.


1795
02:14:11.687 --> 02:14:16.103
I mean, 6 months ago we only
communicated with, "Huh, huh!"


1796
02:14:16.229 --> 02:14:17.354
Do you remember?

1797
02:14:17.479 --> 02:14:21.729
And now you speak German and
understand everything. Almost everything.


1798
02:14:21.854 --> 02:14:25.479
I think it was better than a 'B'
because I'm always keeping in mind


1799
02:14:25.604 --> 02:14:28.771
where Stefi was six months
ago and where she is now.


1800
02:14:28.896 --> 02:14:31.062
That's why she's getting an 'A–'.

1801
02:14:36.854 --> 02:14:39.521
Grading's something you have to learn.

1802
02:14:39.646 --> 02:14:41.020
Quite honestly.

1803
02:14:41.145 --> 02:14:45.187
It's something I always
struggle with as a teacher.


1804
02:14:45.896 --> 02:14:49.479
Saying, "That wasn't so good."
Do you know what I mean? - Yes.


1805
02:14:50.062 --> 02:14:53.437
Ferhan, do you understand
what I'm talking about?


1806
02:14:53.562 --> 02:14:55.229
No.
- Me neither.


1807
02:14:55.354 --> 02:14:58.896
As a teacher,
it's hard for me to tell someone:


1808
02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:02.854
You get an 'F' because
you didn't get anything.


1809
02:15:02.979 --> 02:15:05.187
Because I'm so fond of you.

1810
02:15:05.354 --> 02:15:07.604
Do you know what I mean?
I'm fond of you,


1811
02:15:07.771 --> 02:15:11.312
and everyone else kind of too,
so it's hard for me, okay?


1812
02:15:11.437 --> 02:15:13.604
I'm also fond of Tim...
- You're right.


1813
02:15:13.771 --> 02:15:17.729
So I have to do something
hard, but I do it anyway.


1814
02:15:17.854 --> 02:15:22.062
I have to give two different grades.
Jamie said something self-critical:


1815
02:15:22.187 --> 02:15:24.854
He's not so good at explaining things.

1816
02:15:24.979 --> 02:15:27.604
There's room for improvement, right, Jamie?

1817
02:15:27.729 --> 02:15:29.812
Where you can also improve, Jamie,

1818
02:15:29.938 --> 02:15:32.812
you collaborated with Tim.

1819
02:15:32.938 --> 02:15:35.020
I believe you have a...

1820
02:15:35.145 --> 02:15:37.229
Listen up!

1821
02:15:37.354 --> 02:15:40.562
you have a certain
responsibility for your partner.


1822
02:15:40.771 --> 02:15:44.687
We still have to work on
making you more self-confident.


1823
02:15:44.812 --> 02:15:48.854
I don't think it's such a
good idea to work with Jamie.


1824
02:15:48.979 --> 02:15:51.854
I think it's better if
you choose somebody else,


1825
02:15:51.979 --> 02:15:54.562
like Mattia,
who's also really good at math.


1826
02:15:55.229 --> 02:15:56.854
Any questions?

1827
02:15:58.687 --> 02:16:01.521
Who understood the whole story?

1828
02:16:01.646 --> 02:16:03.562
Half of it?

1829
02:16:03.687 --> 02:16:06.604
That was a very long story, right?
- And beautiful.


1830
02:16:06.729 --> 02:16:08.354
It was really long.

1831
02:16:08.479 --> 02:16:11.312
So it was a lot more
demanding, right, Rabia?


1832
02:16:11.437 --> 02:16:13.020
May I say something good?

1833
02:16:13.145 --> 02:16:17.437
No, but you can ask questions about
the story. - I don't have any. - You?


1834
02:16:17.562 --> 02:16:19.854
No, something good.
- Why?


1835
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:21.812
I understood everything.

1836
02:16:21.938 --> 02:16:24.729
Then retell the story in your own words.

1837
02:16:24.938 --> 02:16:27.062
There were two brothers.

1838
02:16:27.187 --> 02:16:30.354
One was called Werner, the other Walter.

1839
02:16:30.479 --> 02:16:33.145
They called themselves the W
-Brothers.

1840
02:16:34.687 --> 02:16:38.562
It was Friday and it was hot,

1841
02:16:38.687 --> 02:16:42.145
and they were bored.
They didn't know what to do.


1842
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:47.354
And so they built a... what's it called?
A soap bubble racer.


1843
02:16:47.479 --> 02:16:50.020
And they shoved off.

1844
02:16:50.145 --> 02:16:54.729
Then they crashed into
the neighbor's fence.


1845
02:16:54.854 --> 02:16:56.479
They heard a loud bang.

1846
02:16:56.604 --> 02:16:59.020
At first they thought they'd died,

1847
02:16:59.145 --> 02:17:01.521
but they were in a different world.

1848
02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:05.145
And then this woman was being sued.

1849
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:07.979
And because she asked the one their names,

1850
02:17:08.103 --> 02:17:11.020
they said it too loudly
and got all involved.


1851
02:17:11.145 --> 02:17:12.646
Everyone chased them.

1852
02:17:12.771 --> 02:17:14.562
They drove away again,

1853
02:17:14.687 --> 02:17:18.854
and crashed into another
wall to get back home,


1854
02:17:18.979 --> 02:17:20.729
but they entered another world.

1855
02:17:20.854 --> 02:17:23.729
After two minutes they
noticed they were in paradise.


1856
02:17:23.854 --> 02:17:26.437
They were afraid they'd
never get back home,


1857
02:17:26.562 --> 02:17:30.395
so they sat down beneath a
heart-shaped tree and cried.


1858
02:17:30.687 --> 02:17:32.938
Then they slowly rode off.

1859
02:17:33.062 --> 02:17:37.229
A giant... uh... tornado next to them...

1860
02:17:37.354 --> 02:17:39.437
passed by.
- Yeah, passed by.


1861
02:17:39.562 --> 02:17:42.938
But they didn't care.
A flash of lightning... uh...


1862
02:17:43.062 --> 02:17:45.729
struck next to them,
but they didn't care.


1863
02:17:45.854 --> 02:17:47.979
Eventually they hit another wall

1864
02:17:48.103 --> 02:17:50.854
and were happy to be back home.

1865
02:17:50.979 --> 02:17:54.062
And then the one just
wanted to go to bed,

1866
02:17:54.187 --> 02:17:56.812
and the other one watched a little TV.

1867
02:17:59.854 --> 02:18:03.187
Thea Lucia, did he miss anything important?
- No.


1868
02:18:03.562 --> 02:18:07.521
I'll never say to you again
that you can't listen.


1869
02:18:07.687 --> 02:18:10.854
I've said it a few times
but I'll never say it again.


1870
02:18:10.979 --> 02:18:14.896
I have to admit, you paid closer
attention than I did. Great.


1871
02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.354
Evaluation.
- Cengiz?


1872
02:18:18.145 --> 02:18:20.521
I really liked your story.

1873
02:18:20.646 --> 02:18:22.229
I almost fell asleep.

1874
02:18:22.354 --> 02:18:24.354
So when I go to bed at night,

1875
02:18:24.479 --> 02:18:27.812
I'll have my mother read it
to me and I'll fall asleep.


1876
02:18:27.938 --> 02:18:31.771
It was really nice. Perfect!
- Was that an insult or a compliment?


1877
02:18:31.896 --> 02:18:33.687
What's insulting about that?

1878
02:18:33.812 --> 02:18:35.729
Never mind. Let's continue.

1879
02:18:36.521 --> 02:18:39.938
Easy with your lead! Control! Yes!

1880
02:18:40.187 --> 02:18:41.812
Always stay in control!

1881
02:18:46.312 --> 02:18:50.437
Straight, straight from the center!
Stay in the center!


1882
02:18:51.395 --> 02:18:53.020
Fight from the front!

1883
02:18:53.604 --> 02:18:56.270
He keeps jumping back.

1884
02:18:59.145 --> 02:19:00.854
Jab, jab, punch!

1885
02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:03.270
Stand still... and go!

1886
02:19:03.395 --> 02:19:05.020
Feint, feint and hit!

1887
02:19:05.187 --> 02:19:08.062
Stay calm!

1888
02:19:08.938 --> 02:19:10.812
That's enough!

1889
02:19:12.187 --> 02:19:13.604
Hasan!

1890
02:19:14.395 --> 02:19:15.562
Hasan.

1891
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:22.604
Clear the ring for round 2!

1892
02:19:27.354 --> 02:19:29.771
Stay nice and loose in the center!

1893
02:19:44.187 --> 02:19:48.103
Yeah, he should learn to box
and not beat around the bush.


1894
02:19:48.312 --> 02:19:51.312
This is how he'll learn to box.
That's good!


1895
02:19:51.479 --> 02:19:52.938
Right to the stomach!

1896
02:19:53.062 --> 02:19:55.270
Nice and straight, nice and straight!

1897
02:19:55.938 --> 02:19:57.187
Stop!

1898
02:20:05.062 --> 02:20:07.479
You won. They threw in the towel.

1899
02:20:18.229 --> 02:20:21.687
And now for the official results.

1900
02:20:22.103 --> 02:20:27.395
Hugo Dangschat has given up
the fight so the official results are:


1901
02:20:28.229 --> 02:20:33.979
The winner by default:
Hasan Ismail BC Marburg.


1902
02:20:36.729 --> 02:20:38.395
Good job, Hasan!

1903
02:20:38.521 --> 02:20:43.395
In the 2nd round you were
following the tactical route,


1904
02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:45.771
and didn't just hammer away at him.

1905
02:20:45.896 --> 02:20:48.687
You could've knocked him
out in the 1st round,


1906
02:20:48.854 --> 02:20:52.938
but this way you got to box a little.
And that was good.


1907
02:20:53.103 --> 02:20:55.187
Thanks!
- You did it right.


1908
02:21:05.354 --> 02:21:08.812
Rabia, are you going on the class trip?
- I don't know yet.


1909
02:21:08.938 --> 02:21:10.604
Yes, you're coming.

1910
02:21:10.729 --> 02:21:13.145
Who do want for a roommate?

1911
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:15.812
Ilknur.
- Ilknur.


1912
02:21:16.103 --> 02:21:17.354
Hasan!

1913
02:21:17.562 --> 02:21:22.145
Tell me about your daily routine.
- After school I go to home,


1914
02:21:22.312 --> 02:21:24.229
I eat something,

1915
02:21:24.354 --> 02:21:26.354
chill a bit with cell phone.

1916
02:21:26.479 --> 02:21:29.395
When it's time I go to training.

1917
02:21:29.521 --> 02:21:33.729
After training I shower, play a bit
with my phone. Then I go to bed.


1918
02:21:33.854 --> 02:21:38.479
But when I don't have training,
when I go from school to home,


1919
02:21:38.604 --> 02:21:41.562
then I stay home
for about half an hour,

1920
02:21:41.687 --> 02:21:44.521
and then I go out with friends.

1921
02:21:44.646 --> 02:21:46.479
Is that a nice life?

1922
02:21:46.604 --> 02:21:47.854
For me?
- Yes.


1923
02:21:47.979 --> 02:21:49.354
Shitty life!
- Okay.


1924
02:21:49.521 --> 02:21:51.646
What would you like to change?

1925
02:21:54.103 --> 02:21:55.437
No idea.

1926
02:21:56.145 --> 02:21:58.354
Maybe a pretty girl?

1927
02:21:59.229 --> 02:22:01.270
I mean a nice one.

1928
02:22:01.521 --> 02:22:04.938
Beautiful and nice, Mr. Bachmann?
There's no such...


1929
02:22:05.103 --> 02:22:07.312
such, such...

1930
02:22:07.437 --> 02:22:08.646
girls.

1931
02:22:08.771 --> 02:22:11.437
They're pretty but not nice because this...

1932
02:22:11.562 --> 02:22:13.479
You know better than me.

1933
02:22:14.229 --> 02:22:16.270
But what do you think of your mom?

1934
02:22:16.395 --> 02:22:18.270
I think my mom is very nice.

1935
02:22:18.395 --> 02:22:21.479
Your father was lucky then, wasn't he?
- Yeah, sure!


1936
02:22:21.604 --> 02:22:24.562
You could also find
a woman like your mom.

1937
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:27.395
Yeah, I don't wanna get married now.

1938
02:22:27.521 --> 02:22:29.687
I have not that on my mind.

1939
02:22:29.812 --> 02:22:33.312
When would you like to get married?
- I never want to!


1940
02:22:33.437 --> 02:22:35.729
Never. Why?

1941
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:40.187
Because it's too stressful...
- When you have a wife he has a problem.


1942
02:22:40.312 --> 02:22:43.395
When you have husband you get problems.

1943
02:22:45.562 --> 02:22:47.312
Ahhhh!

1944
02:22:47.437 --> 02:22:49.521
She flipped it around.
- Same thing.


1945
02:22:49.729 --> 02:22:53.270
Okay,... Stefi...
- Can I say something? - Yes.


1946
02:22:53.395 --> 02:22:56.395
Man and woman are so...

1947
02:22:56.562 --> 02:22:58.771
How do you say?
- They don't match.


1948
02:22:58.896 --> 02:23:00.270
Yes, because

1949
02:23:00.395 --> 02:23:03.354
the man is, I think, very nice because...

1950
02:23:03.938 --> 02:23:07.729
because the man goes to work so early
then he comes too late,


1951
02:23:07.896 --> 02:23:11.187
Then he makes a shower,
he eats, then he sleeps.


1952
02:23:11.312 --> 02:23:14.062
And what does wife
do all day home alone?

1953
02:23:14.187 --> 02:23:16.562
She does what she wants!

1954
02:23:16.687 --> 02:23:18.437
And the wife, what she is...

1955
02:23:18.562 --> 02:23:22.145
She's got kids,
he doesn't look at the kids...


1956
02:23:22.270 --> 02:23:24.812
What do you say to that, Hasan?

1957
02:23:24.938 --> 02:23:29.395
Raising kids isn't easy either.
- Yes! It's very stressful.


1958
02:23:30.270 --> 02:23:32.312
Stefi, first Stefi!

1959
02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:35.896
But when man has respect...
- Hey, Hasan, listen to Stefi!


1960
02:23:36.062 --> 02:23:39.521
When wife and husband has
respect for each other,


1961
02:23:39.646 --> 02:23:41.187
that doesn't work.

1962
02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:43.395
But you say yourself, "When you have".

1963
02:23:43.562 --> 02:23:46.896
But when you don't have?
- Of course that's so!


1964
02:23:47.312 --> 02:23:51.771
Hey, Cengiz! - When you have no
respect of course you have stress.


1965
02:23:51.896 --> 02:23:54.812
But where does that
respect come from, Stefi?


1966
02:23:54.938 --> 02:23:56.729
Stay here.
- From loving.


1967
02:23:56.938 --> 02:24:00.729
Yes, but love might
last one or two weeks.

1968
02:24:00.854 --> 02:24:02.812
Then life's normal.

1969
02:24:04.103 --> 02:24:07.979
We go to school at 7, get home at 3.
It's the same.


1970
02:24:08.145 --> 02:24:14.521
But you're not tired. You don't have
to lift 20 kilos or some such thing.


1971
02:24:14.646 --> 02:24:16.312
All you have to do is write.

1972
02:24:16.437 --> 02:24:18.938
But his father does.
- But the woman can work too.


1973
02:24:19.062 --> 02:24:22.646
Yeah, your father-
- has to do heavy work.


1974
02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:26.479
We don't do anything here.
We're lucky to have Mr. Bachmann.


1975
02:24:26.646 --> 02:24:28.729
The others work non-stop.

1976
02:24:28.854 --> 02:24:30.729
And what do we do?

1977
02:24:30.854 --> 02:24:35.103
My parents share the load.
- Your mom and dad both work, right?


1978
02:24:35.604 --> 02:24:39.270
What does this mean?
- That women don't do all the work.


1979
02:24:39.395 --> 02:24:43.229
Men help too.
- Your dad also cooked and went shopping.


1980
02:24:43.395 --> 02:24:45.521
What's your ideal woman, Cengiz?

1981
02:24:45.729 --> 02:24:49.062
Well, she should have brown hair.

1982
02:24:49.229 --> 02:24:53.312
Now he's looking at Stefi!
- Uh, brown eyes...


1983
02:24:53.562 --> 02:24:55.646
Okay, not so...

1984
02:24:55.771 --> 02:24:58.020
As tall as Stefi?
- No, much...


1985
02:24:58.229 --> 02:25:00.187
She should be as tall as me.

1986
02:25:00.979 --> 02:25:02.312
And...

1987
02:25:03.646 --> 02:25:04.771
no idea.

1988
02:25:05.103 --> 02:25:08.521
Should she cook for
you or will you cook?

1989
02:25:08.646 --> 02:25:09.812
I'll cook!

1990
02:25:09.938 --> 02:25:12.521
You'll cook for her? That's good.

1991
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:16.604
Will you go to work or
sit on the couch at home?


1992
02:25:16.729 --> 02:25:19.938
I'll just sit around.
- You'll just sit around.


1993
02:25:20.062 --> 02:25:22.354
And she should work?
- Yes.


1994
02:25:22.479 --> 02:25:23.979
It's Tim's turn now.

1995
02:25:24.103 --> 02:25:26.729
How do you imagine your dream woman?

1996
02:25:31.604 --> 02:25:34.145
Uh, dark hair,
- Yes?


1997
02:25:34.270 --> 02:25:35.395
Blue eyes.

1998
02:25:35.521 --> 02:25:37.896
Ohh! That's special!
- Blue eyes?


1999
02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:40.103
That's rare.

2000
02:25:40.479 --> 02:25:41.646
Ilknur!

2001
02:25:41.771 --> 02:25:46.354
Do you care if your husband goes
shopping and empties the dishwasher?


2002
02:25:46.479 --> 02:25:49.312
Yes.
- Yes? So it's a criteria?


2003
02:25:50.145 --> 02:25:52.604
What would you do
if he doesn't do this?

2004
02:25:52.812 --> 02:25:56.812
If he doesn't go shopping, empty the
dishwasher or look after your baby?


2005
02:25:56.938 --> 02:25:58.604
What would you do?

2006
02:25:58.729 --> 02:25:59.854
Eh...

2007
02:26:01.395 --> 02:26:04.270
Would you thrown him out?
- I'd slug him.


2008
02:26:04.479 --> 02:26:07.270
You'd slug him.
Right, I forgot all about that.


2009
02:26:07.395 --> 02:26:10.729
A dream man or dream woman or whatever,

2010
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:14.812
it always turns out differently.

2011
02:26:15.145 --> 02:26:17.290
We've got some philosophers among us.

2012
02:26:17.315 --> 02:26:20.378
It always turns out
differently than we expected.


2013
02:26:20.521 --> 02:26:21.729
Stefi!

2014
02:26:21.938 --> 02:26:25.312
I don't care. He
just has to love me,

2015
02:26:25.437 --> 02:26:27.395
and I have to be happy with he.

2016
02:26:27.604 --> 02:26:30.562
Have you ever been in love?
- Yes, in Bulgaria.


2017
02:26:30.687 --> 02:26:33.103
And?
- No, he's an idiot.


2018
02:26:33.354 --> 02:26:34.938
Yeah, but I was little.

2019
02:26:35.062 --> 02:26:37.521
So you could imagine loving an idiot?

2020
02:26:39.354 --> 02:26:40.437
No!

2021
02:26:40.562 --> 02:26:43.938
An idiot like Cengiz, for example, no way!

2022
02:26:44.145 --> 02:26:47.062
That's an insult.
I'm going to kick you out.


2023
02:26:47.229 --> 02:26:49.687
But I'm not lying. 
He's an idiot.

2024
02:26:49.812 --> 02:26:51.854
I don't want such insults here.

2025
02:26:51.979 --> 02:26:54.103
But I didn't insult he.

2026
02:26:54.354 --> 02:26:56.687
Are you mad at me?

2027
02:26:57.062 --> 02:26:59.020
I didn't throw you out

2028
02:26:59.145 --> 02:27:02.687
because you're looking
at him so affectionately.


2029
02:27:02.938 --> 02:27:06.771
And since we now know you love
idiots, it's okay.


2030
02:27:07.354 --> 02:27:10.521
Rabia, won't there be a
man in your life later on?


2031
02:27:10.646 --> 02:27:13.270
Don't know.
- Do you want to live alone?


2032
02:27:13.395 --> 02:27:15.938
I'll work a lot. 
I don't know yet.

2033
02:27:16.062 --> 02:27:19.896
You don't know? Have you ever been in love?
- Nah.


2034
02:27:20.854 --> 02:27:23.979
What now?
- It's your turn! You have to tell!


2035
02:27:24.354 --> 02:27:25.771
It's your turn!

2036
02:27:25.896 --> 02:27:27.521
Okay, then ask!

2037
02:27:27.687 --> 02:27:29.312
Eh? I already asked!

2038
02:27:29.521 --> 02:27:31.187
What do you wanna know?

2039
02:27:31.395 --> 02:27:34.145
How many girlfriends did you have?
- Eh?


2040
02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:36.854
How many girlfriends?
- 300 or so.


2041
02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:38.604
Like stars in the sky.

2042
02:27:38.771 --> 02:27:40.979
On a clear night.

2043
02:27:41.312 --> 02:27:44.103
Yes, Stefi?
- I have a question.


2044
02:27:44.646 --> 02:27:47.812
How many years was... uh...

2045
02:27:48.062 --> 02:27:51.187
your, your... first love?

2046
02:27:52.437 --> 02:27:53.979
How old were you?

2047
02:27:54.354 --> 02:27:57.187
The first...
- Four years old?


2048
02:27:57.354 --> 02:28:00.687
Uh, the first time with a girl... uh...

2049
02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:04.646
I see!
- I was...


2050
02:28:04.771 --> 02:28:05.896
17.

2051
02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:08.437
Oh ha, Mr. Bachmann!
- I don't mean that.


2052
02:28:08.562 --> 02:28:10.229
What?

2053
02:28:13.145 --> 02:28:15.145
And 14, 15, 16, only ...?

2054
02:28:15.312 --> 02:28:17.354
17!
- Oh, okay.


2055
02:28:17.479 --> 02:28:19.187
You still have some time.

2056
02:28:19.312 --> 02:28:21.145
They say...

2057
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:23.687
My ex-wife was a psychologist.

2058
02:28:23.812 --> 02:28:26.604
She had a professor who researched

2059
02:28:26.729 --> 02:28:30.562
at what age teenagers, children
have sex for the first time.


2060
02:28:30.687 --> 02:28:33.604
And he found out that intelligent children,

2061
02:28:33.729 --> 02:28:35.771
he does intelligence research,

2062
02:28:35.896 --> 02:28:37.896
do that very late.

2063
02:28:38.145 --> 02:28:43.354
So the more intelligent you are,
the later you do it with a girl or a boy.


2064
02:28:43.479 --> 02:28:44.812
That's his...

2065
02:28:44.938 --> 02:28:48.312
- decision.
- The exception proves the rule, right, Ayman?


2066
02:28:48.437 --> 02:28:51.729
So, children with a high IQ

2067
02:28:51.854 --> 02:28:54.604
normally have sex later

2068
02:28:54.729 --> 02:28:57.521
than those with a low IQ.

2069
02:28:57.646 --> 02:28:59.354
So, cleverness.

2070
02:29:01.062 --> 02:29:04.687
So you say the smart ones, uh, do it later?
- Yes.


2071
02:29:04.812 --> 02:29:07.896
Take me, I'm stupid. 
So I can do earlier?

2072
02:29:10.062 --> 02:29:15.437
Well, I'd say you got it right,
but maybe you're not all that dumb.


2073
02:29:43.812 --> 02:29:46.229
Would you like to come in?

2074
02:29:50.354 --> 02:29:52.562
What can I do for you, Ferhan?

2075
02:30:03.896 --> 02:30:05.270
Ferhan!

2076
02:30:05.437 --> 02:30:07.771
I'm going to see her after school.

2077
02:30:07.896 --> 02:30:11.145
I know, but is she a
hoca at the mosque here?


2078
02:30:11.312 --> 02:30:13.145
Are there more hocas?

2079
02:30:13.312 --> 02:30:15.103
Your sister's a hoca?
- Uh-huh.


2080
02:30:15.229 --> 02:30:17.812
From the mosque?
- No, not from the mosque.


2081
02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:22.812
From the mosque is another man and woman.

2082
02:30:22.979 --> 02:30:27.145
Then what is your sister?
Where is she a hoca?


2083
02:30:27.395 --> 02:30:28.521
Well...

2084
02:30:29.187 --> 02:30:31.771
Kids come on Saturday and Sunday.

2085
02:30:32.103 --> 02:30:33.938
Then...

2086
02:30:39.479 --> 02:30:42.229
they go to my sister because Koran.

2087
02:30:42.729 --> 02:30:45.729
So she teaches the Koran?

2088
02:30:46.145 --> 02:30:50.562
There's this thing,
some kind of little notebook


2089
02:30:50.896 --> 02:30:54.521
with the letters.

2090
02:30:54.646 --> 02:30:56.437
In Arabic.

2091
02:30:57.812 --> 02:31:00.312
First they have to do this then Koran.

2092
02:31:11.187 --> 02:31:12.812
Okay, stop.

2093
02:31:13.604 --> 02:31:14.687
Next task.

2094
02:31:15.771 --> 02:31:17.771
Read what it says here.

2095
02:31:17.896 --> 02:31:22.270
Which word belongs in the sentence.
Underline the correct word.


2096
02:31:22.437 --> 02:31:23.687
Exactly.

2097
02:33:44.103 --> 02:33:45.896
Can I take Ferhan with me?

2098
02:33:46.145 --> 02:33:48.229
I want to go along. Please!

2099
02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:50.604
Please, Mr. Bachmann.

2100
02:33:50.729 --> 02:33:53.270
Please!
- Enough! Sit down!


2101
02:33:55.354 --> 02:33:57.354
Sit down please.

2102
02:33:57.479 --> 02:34:01.270
Here's my Latin test. 
I got into the class.

2103
02:34:01.646 --> 02:34:02.687
Nice.

2104
02:34:04.437 --> 02:34:06.938
Oops, I wrote my name wrong. Pusmaz.

2105
02:34:08.479 --> 02:34:10.729
But I don't like my last name.

2106
02:34:14.646 --> 02:34:15.687
Hasan!

2107
02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:25.437
Pusmaz is my mother's
and my papa's last name.


2108
02:34:25.562 --> 02:34:28.771
It comes from Turkey and
means to defend yourself.


2109
02:34:28.938 --> 02:34:31.312
Defend yourself like in boxing.

2110
02:34:33.062 --> 02:34:35.062
Nice. Next!

2111
02:34:35.229 --> 02:34:37.312
It's your turn.
- It's my turn. Bachmann.


2112
02:34:37.479 --> 02:34:39.395
It's a German name.

2113
02:34:39.521 --> 02:34:41.812
Has a really strange history.

2114
02:34:42.062 --> 02:34:43.812
You wanna hear it?

2115
02:34:43.979 --> 02:34:47.521
So there was the Third Reich, Hitler, etc.

2116
02:34:47.812 --> 02:34:51.145
1932-1945.

2117
02:34:53.854 --> 02:34:57.187
My grandma's name was Kowalski.

2118
02:34:58.312 --> 02:35:01.812
Kowalski was a Polish name.

2119
02:35:03.020 --> 02:35:05.854
And Hitler just...

2120
02:35:06.270 --> 02:35:10.521
wait, that was 1937-38, and he said:

2121
02:35:10.687 --> 02:35:15.312
We want to abolish all Polish names.

2122
02:35:15.479 --> 02:35:18.020
And everyone who had a Polish name,

2123
02:35:18.229 --> 02:35:22.646
Hoslowski, Szimanski,
Kowalski, so with "ki",


2124
02:35:22.979 --> 02:35:27.437
on a certain date, 
July 1st, they had to

2125
02:35:27.562 --> 02:35:32.270
go to the registration office, and choose
a German name beforehand.


2126
02:35:32.437 --> 02:35:34.854
Müller, Meier, Schmidt, etc.

2127
02:35:35.604 --> 02:35:38.521
My grandpa wasn't there.

2128
02:35:39.187 --> 02:35:43.812
He'd been drafted and gone
to war. It was just starting.


2129
02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:45.938
He was in the barracks.

2130
02:35:46.646 --> 02:35:50.896
So my grandma went to the
registration office with my father.


2131
02:35:53.187 --> 02:35:55.687
Then came the name Kowalski.

2132
02:35:55.812 --> 02:35:59.636
Every other person in the Ruhr Valley
was called Kowalski, like Müller now.


2133
02:35:59.773 --> 02:36:01.160
Polish heritage.

2134
02:36:01.479 --> 02:36:05.604
Because around 1900, they came from Poland,

2135
02:36:05.979 --> 02:36:09.812
what's now Poland.
Back then it was East Prussia.


2136
02:36:10.062 --> 02:36:15.521
They were the first guest workers
to come to the Ruhr Valley.


2137
02:36:15.771 --> 02:36:19.979
So she was standing in front of
this man, and he said to her:


2138
02:36:20.103 --> 02:36:22.103
Have you chosen a name?

2139
02:36:22.229 --> 02:36:25.771
My grandma just went, "Uh ..."
and was about to say something,


2140
02:36:25.938 --> 02:36:29.521
and he said: For heaven's sake!
I don't have time for this.


2141
02:36:29.771 --> 02:36:31.562
Your name's Bachmann!

2142
02:36:33.187 --> 02:36:36.479
My grandma just stood there
and was afraid to say anything.


2143
02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:41.896
So that's why my father's side
of the family is called Bachmann.


2144
02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:43.646
What does 'Bachmann' mean?

2145
02:36:43.771 --> 02:36:47.646
That's another unbelievably
Cengiz question!


2146
02:36:47.938 --> 02:36:50.729
And Tim's going to answer it for us.

2147
02:36:50.896 --> 02:36:52.229
I don't know.

2148
02:36:52.354 --> 02:36:57.979
Ah, come on! Hasan, what does
Bachmann' mean? What's a 'Bach' [stream]?


2149
02:36:58.103 --> 02:37:02.646
Bach'? A well.
- Ah, come on!


2150
02:37:02.896 --> 02:37:05.938
Do I have to eat my hat?
What's a 'stream'?


2151
02:37:06.145 --> 02:37:08.354
You don't know what a stream is?

2152
02:37:08.562 --> 02:37:10.812
A stream!

2153
02:37:10.938 --> 02:37:13.062
I piss in the stream!

2154
02:37:13.312 --> 02:37:14.812
What's a stream?

2155
02:37:14.938 --> 02:37:18.562
A toilet!
- Oh, oh, oh!


2156
02:37:18.812 --> 02:37:22.229
A river.
- A little river. A mini river.


2157
02:37:22.687 --> 02:37:27.646
A little bit of flowing water.

2158
02:37:29.604 --> 02:37:32.896
So what's a 'Bachmann' [stream
man], Mattia?


2159
02:37:33.103 --> 02:37:34.854
What's a 'Bachmann'?

2160
02:37:35.812 --> 02:37:39.771
The river man? - Right. The river
man who lives along the stream.


2161
02:38:01.312 --> 02:38:04.812
What did we make with our stones?
Some spirals.


2162
02:38:05.312 --> 02:38:08.562
You can make a big,
beautiful spiral around your name.


2163
02:38:09.979 --> 02:38:11.729
No! Please!

2164
02:38:12.729 --> 02:38:16.020
Who let go? Cengiz is out.

2165
02:38:24.896 --> 02:38:28.562
No. Jaime, please!

2166
02:38:31.312 --> 02:38:33.896
You're out!
- Can we play another round?


2167
02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:35.771
Who won?
- Carolin.


2168
02:38:36.812 --> 02:38:39.854
Everyone, upstairs!
- No, another round!


2169
02:38:40.145 --> 02:38:42.187
Mr. Bachmann, did you see my name?

2170
02:38:42.312 --> 02:38:45.437
You can play it yourselves at recess.

2171
02:38:48.979 --> 02:38:52.646
Ilknur, you're such a radiant woman.

2172
02:38:53.312 --> 02:38:56.938
You have such beautiful hair and eyes.

2173
02:38:57.771 --> 02:39:01.312
You're always beaming.

2174
02:39:01.562 --> 02:39:04.729
It's great. You're becoming a woman.

2175
02:39:05.103 --> 02:39:07.604
You're enjoying it just like Stefi.

2176
02:39:07.896 --> 02:39:11.270
Now you suddenly want to
dress totally differently.


2177
02:39:11.521 --> 02:39:14.437
If you wear a headscarf
you have the feeling-


2178
02:39:14.604 --> 02:39:18.020
Does anyone have a headscarf
you could try on just for fun?


2179
02:39:18.646 --> 02:39:22.854
Do you have an extra one with you?
- No, but I can give this one.


2180
02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:24.938
What?
- I can give this one.


2181
02:39:25.187 --> 02:39:27.229
What?
- What do you mean 'give'?


2182
02:39:27.354 --> 02:39:29.562
That? Then where are you going to go?

2183
02:39:30.103 --> 02:39:32.103
Then let her try it.

2184
02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:52.312
Ilknur, you wear a headscarf at the
mosque, right? So you know how it goes.


2185
02:39:57.938 --> 02:39:59.979
Something like that.

2186
02:40:00.145 --> 02:40:03.103
But I'll close it with the scarf.
- Then do it.


2187
02:40:04.604 --> 02:40:07.020
What do you think, Ferhan?

2188
02:40:07.437 --> 02:40:09.395
She looks beautiful.

2189
02:40:09.854 --> 02:40:13.187
Honestly, it looks good somehow.

2190
02:40:13.312 --> 02:40:15.479
I have a photo of me with scarf.

2191
02:40:19.687 --> 02:40:23.812
Ilknur, you look 5 years older.
- I know.


2192
02:40:24.187 --> 02:40:27.270
Do you remember when you
told us about your grandma?


2193
02:40:27.395 --> 02:40:31.062
You told the whole class:
I don't want to look as old as you.


2194
02:40:31.229 --> 02:40:34.229
So, we had...

2195
02:40:35.145 --> 02:40:39.521
When I wear a headscarf I
look like my great-grandma.


2196
02:40:41.521 --> 02:40:43.145
Regina!

2197
02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:46.812
Rabia, would you like
to try a headscarf too?


2198
02:40:47.145 --> 02:40:48.604
No, thanks!

2199
02:40:50.395 --> 02:40:51.812
Thanks, Ferhan.

2200
02:40:54.103 --> 02:40:57.312
But Rabia, you wanted to wear a headscarf.

2201
02:40:57.646 --> 02:40:59.646
What's your mother say about it?

2202
02:40:59.771 --> 02:41:03.938
She said: Wear one if you want.
I won't stop you. I won't force you.


2203
02:41:04.062 --> 02:41:07.646
When my parents were still together,
my mother wore a headscarf.


2204
02:41:07.771 --> 02:41:13.187
But my mother quit wearing one after
they got divorced. - Oh, really?


2205
02:41:13.604 --> 02:41:16.979
Since when?
- Where she was 16 or so.


2206
02:41:17.187 --> 02:41:20.604
She got married at 17
and had me at 20.

2207
02:41:22.938 --> 02:41:25.395
I'll sing a song now.
- Yeah!


2208
02:41:25.521 --> 02:41:28.187
Dream yourselves into the song.

2209
02:41:28.312 --> 02:41:31.479
Mattia, can you go fetch Hasan?

2210
02:41:33.562 --> 02:41:34.646
Dream!

2211
02:41:36.979 --> 02:41:40.062
Anton was a farmer boy,

2212
02:41:40.312 --> 02:41:43.646
handsome and young of years,

2213
02:41:43.896 --> 02:41:46.979
he herded year after year,

2214
02:41:48.312 --> 02:41:51.604
his wild sheep.

2215
02:41:54.687 --> 02:41:57.604
Along came Jakob from the fortress,

2216
02:41:57.729 --> 02:42:00.687
young and born and bred,

2217
02:42:00.854 --> 02:42:03.812
and gladly helped Anton

2218
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:07.270
fetch the sheep.

2219
02:42:07.646 --> 02:42:12.979
The day drew to a close,

2220
02:42:13.896 --> 02:42:18.562
and night fell over them.

2221
02:42:19.771 --> 02:42:24.479
Jakob and Anton are no longer,

2222
02:42:24.646 --> 02:42:29.020
no longer alone.

2223
02:42:29.854 --> 02:42:31.145
Who was yelling?

2224
02:42:31.729 --> 02:42:33.062
Who was it?

2225
02:42:35.687 --> 02:42:38.354
They fell into each other's arms,

2226
02:42:38.646 --> 02:42:41.979
lovingly seduced.

2227
02:42:43.103 --> 02:42:46.062
Then they leaped far into the river,

2228
02:42:46.187 --> 02:42:49.103
and couldn't get enough,

2229
02:42:49.479 --> 02:42:54.479
as the water god watched
over them untroubled.


2230
02:42:55.562 --> 02:42:57.771
Tim, do you want
me to send you outside?

2231
02:43:00.229 --> 02:43:04.312
One day they were spotted,

2232
02:43:04.437 --> 02:43:09.229
Jakob's father came on horseback,

2233
02:43:10.354 --> 02:43:14.812
and saw the young nudes in the river.

2234
02:43:14.938 --> 02:43:19.729
Embracing intimately.

2235
02:43:20.103 --> 02:43:24.395
The father promptly commanded

2236
02:43:24.687 --> 02:43:28.979
Anton be hanged.

2237
02:43:30.187 --> 02:43:34.562
Jakob was beside himself,

2238
02:43:34.938 --> 02:43:39.854
and plunged into the waters,

2239
02:43:39.979 --> 02:43:44.771
never to be seen again.

2240
02:43:44.896 --> 02:43:50.020
And his curse still rings today.

2241
02:43:52.521 --> 02:43:56.020
I'd like to hear if anyone
understood what it was about.


2242
02:43:56.229 --> 02:43:59.812
Of course.
- Ayman, explain the world to us.


2243
02:44:00.646 --> 02:44:02.646
How did it start?

2244
02:44:02.938 --> 02:44:06.812
All I understood was
naked men at the river.


2245
02:44:07.062 --> 02:44:09.354
That's all you ever understand!
- And...


2246
02:44:10.812 --> 02:44:14.020
Something was happening,
but then the day was over.


2247
02:44:15.062 --> 02:44:17.103
And... what happened then?

2248
02:44:17.812 --> 02:44:19.562
Great explanations!

2249
02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:22.103
I'm just saying what I understood.

2250
02:44:23.479 --> 02:44:26.062
Someone arrived on horseback. The father.

2251
02:44:26.646 --> 02:44:28.145
Somewhere.

2252
02:44:28.562 --> 02:44:29.646
What else?

2253
02:44:31.312 --> 02:44:33.145
I forgot the rest.

2254
02:44:33.812 --> 02:44:37.395
Did anyone understand the lyrics? Carolin?

2255
02:44:38.521 --> 02:44:42.020
Ayman, pay attention or you're
going to end up in the corner.


2256
02:44:42.145 --> 02:44:45.103
Turn around and listen.

2257
02:44:45.395 --> 02:44:48.312
Mr. Bachmann, may I
go get some fresh air?

2258
02:44:48.479 --> 02:44:50.103
No, you can wait.

2259
02:44:50.354 --> 02:44:51.854
Tim, what's it about?

2260
02:44:52.812 --> 02:44:55.020
What's up with the two boys?

2261
02:44:57.229 --> 02:44:58.562
I don't know.

2262
02:44:59.145 --> 02:45:00.187
Anastasia?

2263
02:45:00.604 --> 02:45:03.437
I think they fell
in love with each other.

2264
02:45:03.646 --> 02:45:05.187
Exactly.

2265
02:45:05.854 --> 02:45:08.229
Wake up, Ilknur!

2266
02:45:08.354 --> 02:45:12.312
If I told the story that
way, there'd be two girls:


2267
02:45:12.938 --> 02:45:17.270
a farmer's daughter and the
daughter of the lord of the castle.


2268
02:45:17.395 --> 02:45:20.103
The same story: they fell in love.

2269
02:45:20.229 --> 02:45:22.020
Does that happen, Ilknur?

2270
02:45:22.145 --> 02:45:24.938
What do you make of it?
- It's completely normal.


2271
02:45:25.521 --> 02:45:26.979
Who thinks it's bad?

2272
02:45:27.187 --> 02:45:30.437
When two boys or
two girls kiss each other?

2273
02:45:30.729 --> 02:45:33.437
Disgusting!

2274
02:45:34.270 --> 02:45:37.187
I'd rather do it with
a girl than a boy.

2275
02:45:37.312 --> 02:45:39.437
The main thing is they love each other.

2276
02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:43.604
Rabia just said something
really important, as always.


2277
02:45:43.729 --> 02:45:45.646
You've got the final word.

2278
02:45:45.854 --> 02:45:47.562
Lovely!
- Say it again.


2279
02:45:47.687 --> 02:45:51.395
The main thing is they love each other.
- I wanna say something too.


2280
02:45:51.521 --> 02:45:55.521
No, Hasan. Think about what Rabia said.

2281
02:45:55.812 --> 02:45:58.437
Stay seated. We're going to discuss this.

2282
02:45:58.562 --> 02:46:02.020
Rabia said something really beautiful.
- Sex ed.


2283
02:46:02.479 --> 02:46:05.771
And I want Ayman to think it over.
- Can we go now?


2284
02:46:05.938 --> 02:46:08.938
No. - I'm gonna die if I
don't get some fresh air.


2285
02:46:09.354 --> 02:46:11.229
Check out my voice.

2286
02:46:13.270 --> 02:46:15.229
Okay, 20 minute recess.

2287
02:46:16.687 --> 02:46:19.312
How 'bout half an hour, Mr. Bachmann?

2288
02:46:22.812 --> 02:46:24.938
That isn't a normal loving.

2289
02:46:25.103 --> 02:46:27.729
What's normal? 
Is that for you to say?

2290
02:46:27.938 --> 02:46:30.979
No because boy and girl is different.

2291
02:46:31.229 --> 02:46:34.521
Girl with girl and boys:
that's not love. It's...


2292
02:46:34.771 --> 02:46:36.562
What?

2293
02:46:37.062 --> 02:46:39.354
No idea.
- You love Ilknur too.


2294
02:46:39.479 --> 02:46:44.103
Yeah, as a friend not as
a lesbian or whatever.


2295
02:46:44.229 --> 02:46:46.229
Is that so bad?
- Of course!


2296
02:46:46.354 --> 02:46:48.479
Why? Explain it to me.

2297
02:46:48.729 --> 02:46:51.103
Because it's disgusting?
- Why disgusting?


2298
02:46:51.229 --> 02:46:53.103
Because girl and girl...

2299
02:46:53.229 --> 02:46:55.145
What's disgusting about it?

2300
02:46:55.270 --> 02:46:57.646
The two.
- But why's it disgusting?


2301
02:46:57.896 --> 02:47:02.145
What's so disgusting about
two people loving each other?


2302
02:47:02.354 --> 02:47:05.896
What's disgusting about it?
- But girl and girl...


2303
02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:08.479
I'm trying to understand what's disgusting.

2304
02:47:08.604 --> 02:47:11.062
It's all disgusting to me.

2305
02:47:11.604 --> 02:47:14.521
I don't understand. 
Explain it to me.

2306
02:47:14.687 --> 02:47:17.395
The two are disgusting for me.
- Why?


2307
02:47:17.521 --> 02:47:19.270
Because it's disgusting for me.

2308
02:47:19.395 --> 02:47:22.812
That's like saying the dog has
a tail because it has a tail.


2309
02:47:22.938 --> 02:47:26.646
Is that normal for you?
- It's not about me. It's about...


2310
02:47:26.896 --> 02:47:31.938
I have male friends who love a man.

2311
02:47:32.354 --> 02:47:35.896
And I have female
friends who love a woman.

2312
02:47:36.187 --> 02:47:40.479
And I consider these people
completely normal just like me.


2313
02:47:40.646 --> 02:47:43.437
And I find it perfectly okay.

2314
02:47:43.646 --> 02:47:46.938
I'm just trying to understand.

2315
02:47:47.103 --> 02:47:49.270
You can't even say why.

2316
02:47:49.437 --> 02:47:52.395
No, it's not normal because...

2317
02:47:53.187 --> 02:47:57.312
For me it's not normal,
they're people, but...


2318
02:47:58.354 --> 02:48:00.062
not like me.

2319
02:48:00.187 --> 02:48:03.312
Of course. There are all kinds of people.
- No!


2320
02:48:03.437 --> 02:48:06.354
Are you afraid because
they're different than you?


2321
02:48:08.562 --> 02:48:12.395
Try to explain.
- I find it disgusting.


2322
02:48:12.854 --> 02:48:18.020
You have a feeling of disgust inside
you or are you just saying this?


2323
02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:21.229
Because you heard it somewhere?

2324
02:48:22.395 --> 02:48:26.187
I don't know.
- Now that's better.


2325
02:48:26.395 --> 02:48:29.437
But, Mr. Bachmann, you said:

2326
02:48:29.562 --> 02:48:32.187
They're human beings like me.

2327
02:48:32.395 --> 02:48:36.521
They're something different.
They don't think like you.


2328
02:48:36.854 --> 02:48:39.896
Like a teacher, so smart.

2329
02:48:40.103 --> 02:48:43.312
They think like-
- How?


2330
02:48:44.312 --> 02:48:45.646
Not good.

2331
02:48:47.229 --> 02:48:48.812
I'm going to recess.

2332
02:48:50.229 --> 02:48:55.979
Rabia, could you imagine what happens
in the story happening to you?


2333
02:48:56.145 --> 02:48:58.437
That you suddenly love a woman?

2334
02:48:58.687 --> 02:49:03.145
I've never really thought about
falling in love someday.


2335
02:49:03.312 --> 02:49:07.145
I only read about other
people falling in love.


2336
02:49:07.604 --> 02:49:10.729
I always say I don't want to
get married or love anyone.


2337
02:49:10.854 --> 02:49:13.395
I just want to work and stuff.

2338
02:49:14.187 --> 02:49:17.604
You don't find it disgusting?
- I read books about such things.


2339
02:49:18.103 --> 02:49:21.062
I read a lot about this stuff.

2340
02:49:21.312 --> 02:49:24.604
And what you just said was really nice.

2341
02:49:24.729 --> 02:49:27.229
You've already formed your opinion.
- Yes.


2342
02:49:27.395 --> 02:49:30.604
Just imagine your best friend

2343
02:49:30.812 --> 02:49:33.521
loves another girl.

2344
02:49:33.646 --> 02:49:38.145
I wouldn't find her disgusting.

2345
02:49:38.354 --> 02:49:41.896
I'd think it was nice and
would wish her good luck.


2346
02:49:42.145 --> 02:49:45.354
You're an unusual girl, Rabia.

2347
02:49:45.521 --> 02:49:46.979
It's great.

2348
02:49:47.103 --> 02:49:49.896
Leonie, what do you think?
- The same.


2349
02:49:50.145 --> 02:49:52.521
I'm really glad to hear that. Ferhan?

2350
02:49:56.687 --> 02:50:00.229
Wouldn't you like to find out
what the Koran says about this?


2351
02:50:00.938 --> 02:50:03.479
I'll ask my sister.
- Good.


2352
02:50:04.646 --> 02:50:07.771
That's a good idea.
You can tell us tomorrow, okay?


2353
02:50:08.854 --> 02:50:10.771
Regina!
- What?


2354
02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:13.896
When women love women and men men.

2355
02:50:14.145 --> 02:50:15.604
Who cares?

2356
02:51:54.646 --> 02:51:56.687
I'm going to perk you up!

2357
02:51:57.479 --> 02:51:59.687
I'll show you a trick.

2358
02:51:59.938 --> 02:52:04.437
It's called rolling your ears.
Massage your ear lobes.


2359
02:52:04.979 --> 02:52:07.729
Then roll your ears to the inside.

2360
02:52:08.521 --> 02:52:12.395
Ferhan, you can press your palm like this.

2361
02:52:13.312 --> 02:52:14.604
Ferhan!

2362
02:52:15.270 --> 02:52:17.854
Poor Ferhan's offended again.

2363
02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:20.604
Are you rolling them to the inside?

2364
02:52:20.854 --> 02:52:22.229
Like this.

2365
02:52:22.479 --> 02:52:26.896
It stimulates your brain cells
and circulation in your brain.


2366
02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:28.938
And it makes you feel good.

2367
02:52:36.312 --> 02:52:37.729
You get two.

2368
02:52:40.729 --> 02:52:42.020
1 or 2?

2369
02:52:43.729 --> 02:52:44.854
1 or 2?

2370
02:52:45.437 --> 02:52:47.938
Why?
- Ferhan, 1 or 2?


2371
02:52:48.562 --> 02:52:51.896
Three.
- Three. Cengiz says three.


2372
02:52:53.437 --> 02:52:55.229
Who doesn't have any yet?

2373
02:52:55.437 --> 02:52:57.103
Thank you, Mr. Bachmann!

2374
02:52:58.103 --> 02:52:59.103
Thanks!

2375
02:53:00.312 --> 02:53:01.395
Mattia...

2376
02:53:03.062 --> 02:53:05.562
and Ayman, please hand out the tests.

2377
02:53:05.687 --> 02:53:07.771
I'll leave a few here.

2378
02:53:07.979 --> 02:53:10.354
Go ahead and start.

2379
02:53:14.354 --> 02:53:16.938
Ferhan, take off your coat.

2380
02:53:17.145 --> 02:53:19.270
You're gonna melt in here.

2381
02:53:19.604 --> 02:53:22.687
Come over here and take
your test next to me.


2382
02:53:23.145 --> 02:53:25.062
Ferhan, come here please.

2383
02:53:25.187 --> 02:53:27.020
What's today's date?
- The 10th.


2384
02:53:27.354 --> 02:53:30.062
Let's start with:
Where does Alina's mother work?


2385
02:53:30.187 --> 02:53:31.604
It's at the top.

2386
02:53:49.437 --> 02:53:51.521
You need a question mark here.

2387
02:53:52.437 --> 02:53:54.979
Now you answer.

2388
02:53:55.270 --> 02:53:56.979
Exactly. Super!

2389
02:54:48.479 --> 02:54:50.270
Mattia? Not here.

2390
02:54:51.604 --> 02:54:53.604
Listen up: Mattia...

2391
02:54:54.145 --> 02:54:56.229
got the top score.

2392
02:54:56.437 --> 02:54:58.354
We're all proud of him.

2393
02:54:58.646 --> 02:55:00.354
So, Carolin...

2394
02:55:00.479 --> 02:55:02.687
I'm your fan, you know.

2395
02:55:02.812 --> 02:55:04.729
You don't say much during German.

2396
02:55:04.854 --> 02:55:06.312
But when I ask,

2397
02:55:07.062 --> 02:55:09.729
always really interesting answers.

2398
02:55:10.312 --> 02:55:13.312
In high school, you just have to try,

2399
02:55:13.646 --> 02:55:17.854
sometimes, you can put
a note on the desk,

2400
02:55:17.979 --> 02:55:19.646
to speak up once a day.

2401
02:55:19.771 --> 02:55:22.812
All the teachers recommended
you go to high school.


2402
02:55:23.187 --> 02:55:28.145
But you have to realize it
might not work out again. - Yes.


2403
02:55:29.103 --> 02:55:34.062
It would be your 2nd try,
but you might still lose in the end.


2404
02:55:35.437 --> 02:55:37.812
If you keep that in mind and don't

2405
02:55:38.062 --> 02:55:40.604
take it to heart, then it's not bad.

2406
02:55:40.729 --> 02:55:42.938
Right, but I want
to give it a try.

2407
02:55:43.354 --> 02:55:45.521
Brave girl. Great!

2408
02:55:45.771 --> 02:55:48.812
Hasan, you now have a 'D'.

2409
02:55:49.103 --> 02:55:52.354
And I'll give you a 'D+'
because you're improving.


2410
02:55:52.521 --> 02:55:55.687
You're getting better and better. Okay?
- Yes.


2411
02:55:55.812 --> 02:55:59.145
And did you understand everything
about secondary school?


2412
02:55:59.270 --> 02:56:00.979
You're on probation.

2413
02:56:01.103 --> 02:56:05.437
We both know if I gave
you a 'C' now it would be


2414
02:56:05.854 --> 02:56:07.687
kind of a lie.

2415
02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:11.896
But we're on good terms
and you know what I mean.


2416
02:56:12.187 --> 02:56:15.020
You're getting better all
the time. Understand? - Yes.


2417
02:56:15.229 --> 02:56:17.187
It's like a draw in boxing.

2418
02:56:17.395 --> 02:56:18.979
Are you crying now?
- No.


2419
02:56:19.229 --> 02:56:23.103
I could also skip the grade and
give you a grade exemption.


2420
02:56:23.521 --> 02:56:25.729
No, you don't need to.

2421
02:56:27.270 --> 02:56:31.270
I think you've got a lot of potential.
You're intelligent.


2422
02:56:31.521 --> 02:56:35.312
At first I wanted to send
you to high school. Remember?


2423
02:56:35.521 --> 02:56:39.604
When you memorized the
Sorcerer's Apprentice. Amazing!


2424
02:56:39.938 --> 02:56:44.062
But when I asked you now you
couldn't remember a single line.


2425
02:56:45.896 --> 02:56:49.062
I think you'd be better
off in secondary school.


2426
02:56:50.646 --> 02:56:53.270
It'll be up to you in the future.

2427
02:56:54.812 --> 02:56:56.687
It's a shame.

2428
02:56:56.938 --> 02:57:00.145
I kept telling you to learn English.

2429
02:57:00.979 --> 02:57:04.229
But it's too late now.

2430
02:57:04.354 --> 02:57:06.854
But I can still improve.
- Yes!


2431
02:57:07.145 --> 02:57:11.062
During the first year you can-
- improve and...


2432
02:57:11.187 --> 02:57:15.729
improve, then you'll automatically be
moved up to secondary school.


2433
02:57:18.395 --> 02:57:19.395
Stefi!

2434
02:57:23.229 --> 02:57:25.771
You'll be in a secondary school class.

2435
02:57:25.938 --> 02:57:30.771
Then you can go to English or German
remedial lessons during lunchtime.


2436
02:57:30.896 --> 02:57:33.812
But that's not enough,
not for you either, Hasan.


2437
02:57:33.938 --> 02:57:38.062
English remedial at school
is not enough for you two.


2438
02:57:38.312 --> 02:57:42.229
You need after school
tutoring once a week, too,


2439
02:57:42.395 --> 02:57:45.729
or things will look pretty grim.

2440
02:57:46.646 --> 02:57:47.979
It's important.

2441
02:57:48.229 --> 02:57:52.521
It's also good to learn
some English song lyrics.


2442
02:57:55.103 --> 02:57:58.103
You're really fast at
that, strangely enough.


2443
02:57:58.938 --> 02:58:03.187
You're getting a 'D' for now,

2444
02:58:03.312 --> 02:58:06.062
but I know you're a lot smarter.

2445
02:58:06.187 --> 02:58:08.604
It's your best grade ever.

2446
02:58:09.979 --> 02:58:12.395
What would you give yourself in German?

2447
02:58:12.646 --> 02:58:14.812
A 'D'. What else?

2448
02:58:14.938 --> 02:58:17.103
What do you mean: What else?

2449
02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:20.270
A 'D+' with this test.

2450
02:58:22.270 --> 02:58:24.312
So what I find good...

2451
02:58:25.145 --> 02:58:28.938
It'd be nice if you'd look at me.
I'll take off my glasses.


2452
02:58:29.979 --> 02:58:33.395
I like how you
raise your hand so often.

2453
02:58:38.395 --> 02:58:42.437
We just talked about your grade
in German. What are you getting?


2454
02:58:42.729 --> 02:58:44.854
A 'D+'
- Right.


2455
02:58:45.395 --> 02:58:46.521
++'.

2456
02:58:50.354 --> 02:58:53.187
Now let's work out the
grade average together.


2457
02:58:55.812 --> 02:59:00.187
Next to your grade or wherever you
have room on the first page,


2458
02:59:00.395 --> 02:59:02.437
write down this average.

2459
02:59:02.771 --> 02:59:05.103
Come here, Ilknur.

2460
02:59:05.312 --> 02:59:08.979
Everyone do the same
thing on scratch paper.


2461
02:59:09.312 --> 02:59:12.395
Calculate the average like we did recently.

2462
02:59:33.729 --> 02:59:36.312
Do you know why
I think grades are unfair?

2463
02:59:37.229 --> 02:59:39.771
Look, you're sad now.

2464
02:59:40.062 --> 02:59:43.229
You've been working hard lately.

2465
02:59:44.062 --> 02:59:46.354
You've done really good work.

2466
02:59:46.812 --> 02:59:49.646
And I think you're making great progress.

2467
02:59:49.771 --> 02:59:53.521
So when I have to give you
a 'D' in German, then...


2468
02:59:54.187 --> 02:59:56.437
your feeling's correct.

2469
02:59:56.562 --> 03:00:00.229
It doesn't reflect how hard
you've worked in German.


2470
03:00:00.395 --> 03:00:03.854
You've done a great job reading the texts.

2471
03:00:05.354 --> 03:00:09.270
You were the first one finished.
You had a great time, right?


2472
03:00:12.312 --> 03:00:15.729
You're doing much better.
You're doing a lot more.


2473
03:00:16.062 --> 03:00:19.729
But your final results in spelling,

2474
03:00:19.854 --> 03:00:23.354
unfortunately I have to compare
with the other students.


2475
03:00:23.562 --> 03:00:25.479
And when you have more time

2476
03:00:25.604 --> 03:00:27.854
you do better and better.

2477
03:00:30.187 --> 03:00:32.771
And you'll get better grades too.

2478
03:00:36.729 --> 03:00:40.521
Everyone from my prep course failed.

2479
03:00:40.771 --> 03:00:43.437
3, 2, 1 points. Everyone.

2480
03:00:43.687 --> 03:00:46.187
But they get one more try, right?

2481
03:00:46.312 --> 03:00:50.020
One more, yeah.
- Then they have to re-take the whole exam.


2482
03:00:50.312 --> 03:00:53.354
Crazy! Just for failing one shitty section.

2483
03:00:53.771 --> 03:00:58.229
I know all about this. I failed
the political science part.


2484
03:00:58.562 --> 03:01:03.687
In the first state examination.
Then I had one more chance.


2485
03:01:03.812 --> 03:01:08.812
If I'd failed that, I would've had
to re-take the whole thing.


2486
03:01:09.145 --> 03:01:11.103
I was shitting bricks.

2487
03:01:36.479 --> 03:01:39.896
Yesterday was the last
placement conference.


2488
03:01:40.062 --> 03:01:42.896
And a couple of colleagues had the idea

2489
03:01:43.354 --> 03:01:45.145
to take two more students,

2490
03:01:45.479 --> 03:01:48.187
Anastasia, Carolin,

2491
03:01:48.437 --> 03:01:51.062
Regina, Chantal and Ronja

2492
03:01:51.354 --> 03:01:54.479
Thea Lucia and of course Jaime...

2493
03:01:54.896 --> 03:01:57.437
Who did I forget?
- Ayman.


2494
03:01:57.562 --> 03:02:01.646
These 8 kids will be together
in a high school class.


2495
03:02:03.103 --> 03:02:04.437
What do you think about that?

2496
03:02:04.854 --> 03:02:07.395
I think it's a really cool idea.

2497
03:02:07.729 --> 03:02:11.020
But I've already signed
up for the iPad class.


2498
03:02:11.187 --> 03:02:13.062
We'll have to change that.

2499
03:02:13.229 --> 03:02:15.062
We can change that.

2500
03:02:15.437 --> 03:02:18.687
We'll have to talk
it over with your mom,

2501
03:02:18.812 --> 03:02:21.979
but it would be great to be
together in the same class.


2502
03:02:22.229 --> 03:02:25.312
Carolin, what do you think?
- It's cool.


2503
03:02:25.771 --> 03:02:27.854
But I don't know yet if

2504
03:02:28.103 --> 03:02:30.187
I want to go to high school.

2505
03:02:44.354 --> 03:02:48.187
Heigh ho! Hitch up the cart,

2506
03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:51.270
Hitch up the cart,

2507
03:02:51.771 --> 03:02:56.187
Since the wind drives rain across the land,

2508
03:02:56.437 --> 03:02:59.354
Fetch the golden sheaves,

2509
03:02:59.646 --> 03:03:04.145
Heigh ho! Hitch up the cart,

2510
03:03:04.437 --> 03:03:07.479
Since the wind drives...

2511
03:03:30.646 --> 03:03:33.062
There's enough room for you, too, Ferhan.

2512
03:03:33.187 --> 03:03:34.479
Ferhan, Ilknur...

2513
03:03:34.771 --> 03:03:36.187
Stefi.

2514
03:03:36.521 --> 03:03:38.687
In there. Open up.

2515
03:03:39.062 --> 03:03:40.771
It's a normal...

2516
03:03:42.604 --> 03:03:43.604
Open this.

2517
03:03:43.771 --> 03:03:46.729
I emptied it out.
You can put your stuff in there.


2518
03:03:46.896 --> 03:03:49.604
Pull down and turn. Exactly.

2519
03:03:50.646 --> 03:03:55.729
If you want, you can open this
and get some fresh air.


2520
03:03:56.521 --> 03:03:58.437
Super nice!

2521
03:03:58.646 --> 03:04:02.562
I'm so old and ugly here
with two lovely girls.


2522
03:04:02.687 --> 03:04:03.687
Come on.

2523
03:04:03.771 --> 03:04:06.354
They're not ugly.
- "They're"?


2524
03:04:06.729 --> 03:04:08.187
I mean "you're" not ugly.

2525
03:04:10.729 --> 03:04:11.854
Erdzhan.

2526
03:04:17.729 --> 03:04:19.145
Crazy!

2527
03:04:20.854 --> 03:04:25.062
I'd like to chat a bit in Bulgarian.
- I forgot it.


2528
03:04:30.312 --> 03:04:33.771
I love Bulgaria ever
since I met you guys.

2529
03:04:34.812 --> 03:04:37.103
Me too.
- Unbelievable.


2530
03:04:37.229 --> 03:04:39.062
I too.
- You too.


2531
03:04:41.479 --> 03:04:45.229
All three of you are somehow special.

2532
03:04:46.229 --> 03:04:47.896
We've already got coffee.

2533
03:05:10.229 --> 03:05:12.229
Have you ever ridden before?

2534
03:05:13.062 --> 03:05:14.646
Would you like to try?

2535
03:05:15.103 --> 03:05:16.687
Wanna go next?

2536
03:05:17.145 --> 03:05:19.105
No?

2537
03:05:22.521 --> 03:05:24.729
Press your left foot in,

2538
03:05:24.854 --> 03:05:26.854
move your right hand out...

2539
03:05:27.938 --> 03:05:31.187
and rotate your hip and follow me.

2540
03:05:59.896 --> 03:06:02.854
You can do under the belly.
- I already did.


2541
03:06:02.979 --> 03:06:04.062
Great!

2542
03:06:04.979 --> 03:06:06.479
That's good enough.

2543
03:06:16.938 --> 03:06:18.979
Give me your cell phone til tonight.

2544
03:06:19.103 --> 03:06:21.354
Martin, Tim are playing the most.

2545
03:06:21.479 --> 03:06:24.896
There's no signal anyway.
There's nothing else to do here.


2546
03:06:27.854 --> 03:06:30.938
If it breaks, you're payin' for it.
- Turn it off.


2547
03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:02.187
Music please!

2548
03:07:03.020 --> 03:07:04.521
We're dancing!

2549
03:07:05.103 --> 03:07:10.020
Hey, Stefi! Not now. Quiet! Listen up!

2550
03:07:10.896 --> 03:07:11.979
So, everyone...

2551
03:07:12.771 --> 03:07:15.979
Gather around me so everyone can hear.

2552
03:07:16.687 --> 03:07:19.646
Jan, who lives here, just told me

2553
03:07:19.771 --> 03:07:24.979
we should quiet down and not make
any more noise after 10 o'clock.


2554
03:07:26.312 --> 03:07:28.062
Rabia!

2555
03:07:28.646 --> 03:07:30.646
Class trips are strenuous.

2556
03:07:31.062 --> 03:07:35.896
Some are so homesick that
they really get sick.


2557
03:07:36.020 --> 03:07:38.437
He's not listening again!
- Because you're-


2558
03:07:38.562 --> 03:07:41.729
You're not here, Stefi. 
It's just us guys.

2559
03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:44.354
Jamie's spoken from the heart.

2560
03:07:44.562 --> 03:07:47.062
He's here physically and mentally,

2561
03:07:47.270 --> 03:07:51.562
but emotionally he's with
his family and his new dog.


2562
03:07:51.854 --> 03:07:53.771
It's boring.

2563
03:07:55.812 --> 03:07:57.437
You say it's boring.

2564
03:07:57.562 --> 03:07:59.687
We're not allowed to do what we want.

2565
03:07:59.938 --> 03:08:02.187
If we laugh it's: "Off to your room!"

2566
03:08:02.437 --> 03:08:03.979
That's not true.

2567
03:08:04.103 --> 03:08:08.312
All I can say is you're not being honest.
That's not being honest.


2568
03:08:08.479 --> 03:08:10.479
I just don't feel like it.

2569
03:08:10.729 --> 03:08:13.103
Like what?
- I don't know.


2570
03:08:13.354 --> 03:08:15.020
Now that's more honest.

2571
03:08:15.312 --> 03:08:18.103
Tell us more.

2572
03:08:18.395 --> 03:08:21.312
Reach inside your gut, your feelings.

2573
03:08:22.062 --> 03:08:25.437
When you laugh like that
you don't take yourself seriously.


2574
03:08:26.020 --> 03:08:28.354
I'm just following my gut feelings.

2575
03:08:29.145 --> 03:08:31.312
I'm just not into this class trip.

2576
03:08:31.437 --> 03:08:35.395
Hasan, you just told me you don't know
why you're in a bad mood.


2577
03:08:35.896 --> 03:08:39.395
It could be an age thing.
Mood swings are part of it.


2578
03:08:39.521 --> 03:08:41.479
Could be. Laugh one minute,

2579
03:08:41.646 --> 03:08:43.312
cry the next.

2580
03:08:43.437 --> 03:08:44.812
But I don't cry.

2581
03:08:46.479 --> 03:08:48.187
They're fighting upstairs.

2582
03:08:48.479 --> 03:08:49.687
Who?

2583
03:08:49.896 --> 03:08:52.145
Like Ayman and Mattia.

2584
03:08:52.437 --> 03:08:54.604
Oh, Ayman and Mattia got in a fight?

2585
03:08:54.812 --> 03:08:57.229
Yeah, Ayman choked him.

2586
03:08:57.604 --> 03:09:00.229
Why didn't you come down and tell me?

2587
03:09:00.479 --> 03:09:03.854
They wanted to settle it themselves.

2588
03:09:04.145 --> 03:09:10.229
It's the first time I've ever seen
Mattia cry. He was really sad.


2589
03:09:11.479 --> 03:09:14.062
Mattia's the kind of guy,

2590
03:09:14.229 --> 03:09:17.604
when he likes something,

2591
03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:20.562
he doesn't show it.

2592
03:09:20.687 --> 03:09:23.312
He laughs when he finds something funny.

2593
03:09:23.479 --> 03:09:25.395
But when he's sad,

2594
03:09:25.521 --> 03:09:28.812
he just sits down somewhere
and keeps talking,


2595
03:09:28.979 --> 03:09:30.812
and you don't notice it.

2596
03:09:31.521 --> 03:09:35.479
It's great what you're saying, Jaime.
I'm learning a new side of you.


2597
03:09:36.062 --> 03:09:38.229
That's a great description.

2598
03:09:38.354 --> 03:09:41.771
What you said about Mattia
is really sensitive.


2599
03:09:41.979 --> 03:09:44.145
He's having a really hard time.

2600
03:09:44.312 --> 03:09:47.229
Now I understand a bit from your stories.

2601
03:09:47.437 --> 03:09:49.187
It's great!

2602
03:09:51.312 --> 03:09:53.145
Really! I thought you were

2603
03:09:53.812 --> 03:09:55.729
such a tough guy.

2604
03:09:56.312 --> 03:10:00.646
Great how you... I think you like Mattia.
- Yeah, a lot.


2605
03:10:01.103 --> 03:10:05.354
Then you could help Mattia

2606
03:10:05.521 --> 03:10:08.437
when he gets in a tight
spot like now with Ayman,


2607
03:10:08.562 --> 03:10:10.646
or when something's weighing on him,

2608
03:10:10.812 --> 03:10:14.229
maybe something at home,
or maybe he's just homesick like you.


2609
03:10:16.354 --> 03:10:18.729
I'm sleeping here, man!

2610
03:10:18.938 --> 03:10:20.854
We're sleeping here!

2611
03:10:21.270 --> 03:10:22.938
Get your fat...

2612
03:10:24.562 --> 03:10:27.062
Get up, dude! We're sleeping here.

2613
03:10:31.562 --> 03:10:35.020
If you can't think of anything,
I'm sending you home. Got it?


2614
03:10:37.771 --> 03:10:42.395
If you want to be their friend there are
other ways of showing it. Right?


2615
03:10:43.521 --> 03:10:46.896
The three are really nice boys.

2616
03:10:47.020 --> 03:10:49.395
Physical strength isn't everything.

2617
03:10:49.896 --> 03:10:51.729
And you cried.

2618
03:10:51.979 --> 03:10:55.437
Yeah, I always cry when I'm nervous.

2619
03:10:55.771 --> 03:10:57.896
You were afraid, weren't you?

2620
03:10:59.062 --> 03:11:02.562
Not afraid, just really nervous.

2621
03:11:06.312 --> 03:11:08.020
I'm speechless.

2622
03:11:08.145 --> 03:11:12.229
I know both of you. I don't understand
how you could do that to Mattia.


2623
03:11:12.729 --> 03:11:14.687
What do you have to say?

2624
03:11:17.521 --> 03:11:18.854
Because...

2625
03:11:19.312 --> 03:11:21.729
we were having fun and he...

2626
03:11:21.854 --> 03:11:26.145
because it hurt, 
I went after him.

2627
03:11:26.437 --> 03:11:31.729
And now I realize that was a mistake.
- You squeezed his throat somehow.


2628
03:11:32.896 --> 03:11:35.896
He didn't do it like that.
- How then?


2629
03:11:36.187 --> 03:11:39.270
Like this.
- From behind?


2630
03:11:39.521 --> 03:11:40.646
Yes.

2631
03:11:40.771 --> 03:11:45.062
Then I had it wrong. I thought
you had him by the larynx.


2632
03:11:45.187 --> 03:11:47.437
I've never been this sorry before.

2633
03:11:48.521 --> 03:11:50.312
Upstairs I just...

2634
03:12:01.604 --> 03:12:04.312
It's your decision now.
- What?


2635
03:12:04.437 --> 03:12:06.437
Can you...

2636
03:12:07.729 --> 03:12:12.562
can we set this aside for now?
- Yes.


2637
03:12:14.062 --> 03:12:16.979
He already apologized 1000 times.

2638
03:12:17.687 --> 03:12:19.646
I want to leave it at that.

2639
03:12:31.562 --> 03:12:33.687
Do you only eat at Mama's?

2640
03:12:37.270 --> 03:12:40.270
You eat bread with jam and cheese!

2641
03:12:43.812 --> 03:12:45.187
It's good.

2642
03:12:45.979 --> 03:12:47.646
She said this is hen.

2643
03:12:48.604 --> 03:12:51.687
The other one's hen too.
- I think you're right.


2644
03:12:51.979 --> 03:12:56.729
They don't have pork here.
- Ayman, put the cheese someplace.


2645
03:12:59.979 --> 03:13:03.521
Hey, German! We're in Germany.
- Excuse me.


2646
03:13:03.771 --> 03:13:05.562
I don't excuse you.

2647
03:13:11.521 --> 03:13:14.103
Come over here.
- It's gonna lick me.


2648
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:17.312
And what if he licks you?
You'll get wet, huh?


2649
03:13:17.437 --> 03:13:19.687
Then you can wash your hands afterwards.

2650
03:13:19.896 --> 03:13:21.938
What if he bites?
- He doesn't.


2651
03:13:22.062 --> 03:13:23.771
Are you sure?
- Absolutely.


2652
03:13:23.979 --> 03:13:27.020
Ayman, he's never bitten me.

2653
03:13:27.270 --> 03:13:28.729
Is it a man or woman?

2654
03:13:28.854 --> 03:13:31.729
It's a guy, a man. 
Go ahead and touch it.

2655
03:13:32.521 --> 03:13:35.312
Can I touch him?
- It's his turn.


2656
03:13:35.479 --> 03:13:37.646
Go ahead!
- You go to the front.


2657
03:13:37.771 --> 03:13:39.145
I'll take the front.

2658
03:13:39.395 --> 03:13:41.270
Yeah, just like that.

2659
03:13:42.312 --> 03:13:45.145
He's starting to relax with your hands.

2660
03:13:45.479 --> 03:13:47.103
You have magic hands.

2661
03:13:48.312 --> 03:13:50.479
See, he stopped licking me.

2662
03:13:50.896 --> 03:13:53.437
He's enjoying your caresses.

2663
03:13:57.270 --> 03:13:59.646
Look: relaxation.

2664
03:14:00.562 --> 03:14:01.646
Great!

2665
03:14:55.145 --> 03:14:59.103
I'd like to know what it looks like

2666
03:14:59.229 --> 03:15:03.395
where you come from in Bulgaria.
Is it a village, a city?


2667
03:15:03.521 --> 03:15:08.062
Did you live in a hi-rise
or on a farm like here?


2668
03:15:08.312 --> 03:15:11.729
Did you have tomatoes and
peppers in your garden?


2669
03:15:13.187 --> 03:15:15.479
What was it like?

2670
03:15:15.604 --> 03:15:16.771
I was in city.

2671
03:15:17.604 --> 03:15:19.145
In big city.

2672
03:15:19.437 --> 03:15:21.604
I live in a block.

2673
03:15:21.729 --> 03:15:25.229
Not in a house,
but a block, 4th floor.

2674
03:15:25.437 --> 03:15:28.521
My mom has flowers but no tomatoes,

2675
03:15:28.646 --> 03:15:31.521
because our veranda is too small.

2676
03:15:31.646 --> 03:15:34.020
What's the city called?
- Varna.


2677
03:15:34.145 --> 03:15:35.187
Varna?

2678
03:15:35.896 --> 03:15:38.646
You'll have to show me in the atlas.

2679
03:15:39.395 --> 03:15:41.187
Okay, now it's Chantal's turn.

2680
03:15:41.395 --> 03:15:44.562
Why were you together with Gunda?
- No idea.


2681
03:15:44.896 --> 03:15:46.562
You and Gunda were together?

2682
03:15:47.020 --> 03:15:49.979
I totally missed that.
- But only two days.


2683
03:15:50.354 --> 03:15:52.145
Oh, two days.

2684
03:15:53.687 --> 03:15:56.604
I thought I knew what
was up in our class.

2685
03:15:56.812 --> 03:15:58.938
But I missed those two days.

2686
03:15:59.437 --> 03:16:00.729
Mattia!

2687
03:16:04.979 --> 03:16:06.270
Hasan!

2688
03:16:10.145 --> 03:16:13.646
Happy birthday to you!

2689
03:16:13.771 --> 03:16:17.020
Happy birthday, dear Hasan,

2690
03:16:17.145 --> 03:16:20.479
happy birthday to you!

2691
03:17:01.687 --> 03:17:03.812
Stefi! We need you.

2692
03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:08.062
Through the night and
the thickest branchwood,


2693
03:17:08.812 --> 03:17:12.103
So that you know no fears,

2694
03:17:12.812 --> 03:17:16.687
Tell a little piece of truth,

2695
03:17:17.562 --> 03:17:20.896
Look how the desert lives,

2696
03:17:21.687 --> 03:17:25.812
Create a little bit of serenity,

2697
03:17:26.812 --> 03:17:29.729
And look how the veil lifts.

2698
03:17:30.521 --> 03:17:34.312
A desert made of cement and asphalt,

2699
03:17:35.229 --> 03:17:38.145
But it lives and opens a gap,

2700
03:17:39.479 --> 03:17:43.395
Which shows you new things,
Shows that old things will vanish,


2701
03:17:43.687 --> 03:17:47.562
Even if your pain
reaches up to the sky,

2702
03:17:47.687 --> 03:17:50.896
And when a song leaves my lips,

2703
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:55.312
It's only to convey love to you,

2704
03:17:56.270 --> 03:17:59.771
Through the night and
the thickest branchwood,


2705
03:18:00.771 --> 03:18:03.437
So that you know no fears,

2706
03:18:04.812 --> 03:18:08.020
So that you know no fears.

2707
03:18:14.145 --> 03:18:17.103
Yeah!
- Thanks a lot!


2708
03:18:48.479 --> 03:18:53.729
Then I'll go to a guitar shop in Giessen
and get us another guitar for here.


2709
03:18:53.854 --> 03:18:54.854
Mr. Bachmann!

2710
03:18:54.979 --> 03:18:59.771
If you need this guitar, maybe I can
bring it. - No! Keep yours at home.


2711
03:18:59.938 --> 03:19:03.145
Why?
- It's yours for home.


2712
03:19:03.312 --> 03:19:08.479
The flowers, everything gets
damaged here. The guitar too.


2713
03:19:08.604 --> 03:19:11.646
Yours stays at home. 
It's only for you.

2714
03:19:11.771 --> 03:19:16.229
The guitar told me it never wants to
come to school again. Remember?


2715
03:19:16.729 --> 03:19:20.687
You pour a lot of your
heart into your playing.


2716
03:19:20.938 --> 03:19:24.187
Yeah, but thank God Jaime's here.

2717
03:19:24.312 --> 03:19:26.812
Yeah, Jaime's great too.

2718
03:19:26.938 --> 03:19:29.020
He gave me a lot.

2719
03:19:29.145 --> 03:19:31.812
But you make it into your own thing.

2720
03:19:31.979 --> 03:19:35.437
I couldn't play like that.

2721
03:19:36.729 --> 03:19:37.729
Sorry!

2722
03:19:37.854 --> 03:19:41.479
Go kick it around some on the playground.

2723
03:19:41.729 --> 03:19:46.479
No big deal. Go kick it outside,
not here in front of the door.


2724
03:19:46.604 --> 03:19:51.896
Jaime! 15 minutes on the playing
field, not down there.


2725
03:19:52.020 --> 03:19:54.062
Or my colleagues will get upset.

2726
03:19:55.312 --> 03:19:57.854
So, whole family so nice?

2727
03:19:58.437 --> 03:19:59.687
Mine?
- Yeah.


2728
03:20:03.270 --> 03:20:07.812
You mean my father and mother and all?
- Yes.


2729
03:20:09.062 --> 03:20:14.646
Other people like my neighbors
and friends found my parents nice.


2730
03:20:14.771 --> 03:20:17.145
But I didn't find
them the least bit nice.

2731
03:20:17.270 --> 03:20:18.312
Why?

2732
03:20:22.145 --> 03:20:24.979
My father worked.

2733
03:20:25.312 --> 03:20:28.771
People used to work Saturdays as well.

2734
03:20:28.938 --> 03:20:30.229
Til noon.

2735
03:20:30.646 --> 03:20:33.103
Not like Fridays later on.

2736
03:20:33.229 --> 03:20:34.979
Then he came home...

2737
03:20:35.896 --> 03:20:37.145
and got drunk.

2738
03:20:37.812 --> 03:20:41.187
He drank a whole case of beer
by himself over the weekend.


2739
03:20:41.312 --> 03:20:45.229
I'm talking to Hasan now.
I'll be right with you, Regina.


2740
03:20:46.145 --> 03:20:47.938
Or is it urgent?

2741
03:20:48.354 --> 03:20:50.187
My mother

2742
03:20:50.312 --> 03:20:55.354
cleaned all day Saturday
because she worked all week.


2743
03:20:56.020 --> 03:20:59.812
She was a hairdresser,
then a clerk later on.


2744
03:21:02.270 --> 03:21:03.854
She got drunk at night too.

2745
03:21:04.354 --> 03:21:06.062
So they were both drunk.

2746
03:21:06.687 --> 03:21:09.896
So when I was your age,

2747
03:21:10.145 --> 03:21:14.395
I quit spending weekends
at home. I played soccer.


2748
03:21:16.771 --> 03:21:20.979
There were other people like me
who didn't like to go home.


2749
03:21:21.812 --> 03:21:25.103
It was okay during the week.
They didn't get drunk.


2750
03:21:25.312 --> 03:21:27.562
But they had an alcohol problem,

2751
03:21:27.687 --> 03:21:30.979
and were really unpleasant
when they got drunk.


2752
03:21:31.896 --> 03:21:34.187
Now you know something about me.

2753
03:21:49.229 --> 03:21:51.771
Excuse me, Ms. Bal. I love you.

2754
03:21:53.354 --> 03:21:57.270
Ebru, you wanna sit down?
- Is it okay to stay? Thanks!


2755
03:21:57.562 --> 03:21:59.229
May I stay here?

2756
03:22:02.687 --> 03:22:05.771
I think in two years we'll definitely

2757
03:22:06.062 --> 03:22:08.687
see one another again on a regular basis.

2758
03:22:08.812 --> 03:22:09.812
I hope you...

2759
03:22:11.145 --> 03:22:12.562
- get home safely.

2760
03:22:12.771 --> 03:22:18.062
with your new teachers in

2761
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:21.687
I just spoke to a few students

2762
03:22:21.812 --> 03:22:24.771
about how lessons have been since I left.

2763
03:22:26.062 --> 03:22:30.771
Unfortunately, school's not
always a picnic. - School sucks!


2764
03:22:30.896 --> 03:22:34.854
You have to behave like
the teacher expects you to.


2765
03:22:35.896 --> 03:22:38.312
You're the ones who get graded,

2766
03:22:38.437 --> 03:22:41.354
so you should really do
what your teachers say.


2767
03:22:45.270 --> 03:22:48.062
Good luck in 7th grade.
- Thanks!


2768
03:22:48.729 --> 03:22:50.812
I wish you all the best.

2769
03:22:50.938 --> 03:22:53.354
You're a great class.

2770
03:22:53.521 --> 03:22:56.020
Thanks! You're also great!

2771
03:22:59.771 --> 03:23:03.687
You were a real pain a lot
of the time, I have to admit.


2772
03:23:03.812 --> 03:23:05.979
See, you guys were a pain!

2773
03:23:06.145 --> 03:23:10.562
Cengizhan sure did his part.

2774
03:23:10.729 --> 03:23:12.979
But not us, Ms. Bal.

2775
03:23:13.312 --> 03:23:16.562
Who was it?

2776
03:23:16.771 --> 03:23:20.729
But I've really taken you to heart
in such a short time.


2777
03:23:20.854 --> 03:23:21.896
Not me.

2778
03:23:22.729 --> 03:23:26.896
Rabia, are you staying here
or are you planning on moving?


2779
03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:29.312
We're moving close by.

2780
03:23:30.312 --> 03:23:31.312
Nice.

2781
03:23:31.938 --> 03:23:34.687
You didn't want to move
away, did you, Rabia?


2782
03:23:34.854 --> 03:23:36.270
I put up a fight!

2783
03:23:37.312 --> 03:23:39.437
Remember your first days here?

2784
03:23:39.604 --> 03:23:42.103
You didn't know anyone
and wanted to move back.


2785
03:23:42.312 --> 03:23:45.020
Now you say you fought to stay.

2786
03:23:45.812 --> 03:23:47.604
You're like family to me.

2787
03:23:49.145 --> 03:23:52.562
We'll see one another tomorrow
but I might miss some of you.


2788
03:23:52.729 --> 03:23:55.103
So I just wanted to say goodbye.

2789
03:23:55.604 --> 03:23:57.270
You may now go home.

2790
03:24:02.854 --> 03:24:06.938
Just in case we don't see each other again.
- Oh, Jamie, aren't you coming tomorrow?


2791
03:24:11.896 --> 03:24:13.479
See you tomorrow!

2792
03:24:14.979 --> 03:24:18.437
I'll definitely be home... with the baby.

2793
03:24:18.562 --> 03:24:22.812
Bye, Ms. Bal!
- Ah, Thea, you're such a sweetheart.


2794
03:24:25.854 --> 03:24:27.187
Cengizhan.

2795
03:24:28.604 --> 03:24:31.729
Cengizhan, stay out of trouble, okay?

2796
03:24:34.771 --> 03:24:36.521
Bye, Ayman. Take care.

2797
03:24:36.646 --> 03:24:39.562
Good luck! You're on the right path.

2798
03:24:42.479 --> 03:24:46.395
Hasan... you're not crying, are you?

2799
03:24:47.103 --> 03:24:50.854
We'll see each other again, right Hasan?
- Yeah.


2800
03:24:50.979 --> 03:24:52.479
I'll eat lots of ice cream.

2801
03:24:52.604 --> 03:24:57.187
There's a good chance you'll
see me at the ice cream shop.


2802
03:24:57.896 --> 03:25:00.437
Bye, Miss Bal!
- Bye!


2803
03:25:00.604 --> 03:25:03.646
Good luck!
- You too!


2804
03:25:23.103 --> 03:25:24.187
60 cents.

2805
03:26:43.062 --> 03:26:45.771
Mr. Bachmann, I...
- You have to feel it.


2806
03:26:45.896 --> 03:26:47.020
I hate feeling.

2807
03:26:47.896 --> 03:26:49.354
Take your time.

2808
03:26:49.687 --> 03:26:52.395
Look: nice and easy.

2809
03:26:56.479 --> 03:26:57.771
Mr. Bachmann!

2810
03:26:59.103 --> 03:27:00.187
I hate this!

2811
03:27:01.854 --> 03:27:03.604
Tell me when you're done.

2812
03:27:08.354 --> 03:27:09.812
Na, I'm not doin' it.

2813
03:27:11.479 --> 03:27:14.354
Think about making your teacher happy.

2814
03:27:18.354 --> 03:27:19.687
It doesn't work!

2815
03:27:20.562 --> 03:27:21.646
Damn!

2816
03:27:21.812 --> 03:27:22.812
Look!

2817
03:27:23.270 --> 03:27:24.812
It's all in the touch.

2818
03:27:31.312 --> 03:27:32.312
Cool!

2819
03:27:32.437 --> 03:27:33.521
Yeah.

2820
03:27:34.062 --> 03:27:35.229
Now your turn.

2821
03:27:43.687 --> 03:27:45.312
Now I'm happy.

2822
03:27:45.938 --> 03:27:47.187
How nice.

2823
03:27:49.771 --> 03:27:51.187
Nice, huh?

2824
03:27:51.437 --> 03:27:53.896
Nice. Very nice.

2825
03:27:54.854 --> 03:27:56.437
You can add:

2826
03:27:56.938 --> 03:27:58.646
Mr. Bachmann happy.

2827
03:27:59.062 --> 03:28:00.103
Okay.

2828
03:28:02.687 --> 03:28:06.062
Girls, move the tables to the back.

2829
03:28:21.604 --> 03:28:22.854
Wanna try, Cengizhan?

2830
03:28:22.979 --> 03:28:25.562
Wait, I'm the master here.
I do this every day.


2831
03:28:28.020 --> 03:28:29.062
Damn hot!

2832
03:28:29.270 --> 03:28:30.812
Like this.

2833
03:28:31.395 --> 03:28:32.854
Watch closely.

2834
03:28:33.145 --> 03:28:34.437
How's it work?

2835
03:28:36.687 --> 03:28:38.187
Push! Push!

2836
03:28:52.979 --> 03:28:55.437
Martin? Do you want it?

2837
03:28:55.854 --> 03:28:57.145
He's lonely.

2838
03:28:57.771 --> 03:28:59.062
Poor fella.

2839
03:29:00.354 --> 03:29:02.562
Dump him out into the bin first.

2840
03:29:03.395 --> 03:29:04.938
Come right back up.

2841
03:29:07.562 --> 03:29:09.604
Chantal, take the bowl.

2842
03:29:46.562 --> 03:29:47.604
I find...

2843
03:29:49.896 --> 03:29:51.103
it quite...

2844
03:29:52.812 --> 03:29:54.896
Who can finish the sentence?

2845
03:29:55.020 --> 03:29:56.312
I find it quite...

2846
03:29:56.979 --> 03:29:58.103
empty.

2847
03:29:59.646 --> 03:30:03.354
I found it a bit strenuous.

2848
03:30:03.479 --> 03:30:05.604
Not physically, but

2849
03:30:05.729 --> 03:30:08.562
cleaning out everything was like

2850
03:30:08.938 --> 03:30:11.729
an end, a final end.

2851
03:30:15.312 --> 03:30:16.812
Yeah, it sucks.

2852
03:30:17.604 --> 03:30:19.479
It really sucks.

2853
03:30:19.646 --> 03:30:20.771
For me.

2854
03:30:22.020 --> 03:30:25.729
Because we had good time here.

2855
03:30:26.312 --> 03:30:30.062
We did good things...

2856
03:30:30.896 --> 03:30:32.562
in this room.

2857
03:30:33.729 --> 03:30:35.562
All these report cards,

2858
03:30:35.687 --> 03:30:37.521
this is my final word,

2859
03:30:37.687 --> 03:30:40.270
are nothing but snapshots.

2860
03:30:40.604 --> 03:30:42.521
Do you understand, Ferhan?

2861
03:30:42.646 --> 03:30:44.437
This isn't really you.

2862
03:30:44.687 --> 03:30:47.771
You're all completely different people.

2863
03:30:48.020 --> 03:30:51.312
These grades don't reflect
who you are at all.


2864
03:30:51.437 --> 03:30:53.646
They're only snapshots

2865
03:30:53.854 --> 03:30:58.103
of kind of unimportant
things like math and English.


2866
03:30:58.437 --> 03:31:03.687
What's much more important is that
you're all terrific kids and youngsters.


2867
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:07.979
You're all really honest.
Remain true to yourselves.


2868
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:11.979
It's not so important whether good or bad.

2869
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:13.479
So, my dears...

2870
03:31:29.270 --> 03:31:30.646
Bye!

2871
03:31:32.521 --> 03:31:33.896
The tables!

2872
03:31:37.896 --> 03:31:39.062
Thanks!

2873
03:31:40.604 --> 03:31:42.812
Bye, Mr. Bachmann.
- Bye, Mr. Ayman.


2874
03:31:46.687 --> 03:31:48.771
That's really nice, Tim.

2875
03:31:51.187 --> 03:31:52.395
Thanks!

2876
03:31:53.312 --> 03:31:56.145
Here.
- Look, I was in your room, right?


2877
03:31:57.395 --> 03:32:01.521
Bye. Martin, Tim, come give me a hug.

2878
03:32:03.187 --> 03:32:05.646
We'll do a pack hug. 
You know that?

2879
03:32:06.562 --> 03:32:08.562
Now open your present.
- Okay!


2880
03:32:08.729 --> 03:32:10.479
Maybe it's not so nice.

2881
03:32:10.687 --> 03:32:13.229
You said Bulgaria...

2882
03:32:13.646 --> 03:32:18.270
Oh, a Bulgarian hat! I'm gonna
wear it the rest of the day.


2883
03:32:19.771 --> 03:32:22.020
Did you knit it yourself?
- No.


2884
03:32:22.687 --> 03:32:24.687
Ah, it's nice.

2885
03:32:26.854 --> 03:32:29.062
Come, Bulgarian.

2886
03:32:29.270 --> 03:32:31.938
Let's take a look in the mirror.

2887
03:32:34.562 --> 03:32:37.020
Ah, it's my new favorite hat.

2888
03:32:37.479 --> 03:32:38.771
Look!

2889
03:32:39.437 --> 03:32:41.479
It's great, huh?

2890
03:32:41.604 --> 03:32:43.771
I'll never take it off again.

2891
03:32:44.771 --> 03:32:47.020
I'm adopting you, Hasan!

2892
03:32:48.020 --> 03:32:52.020
Once upon a time there
was a Mr. Bachmann...


2893
03:35:32.562 --> 03:35:37.145
