<i>A 30th Celebration</i>starts now.


10
00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:08.663
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a faraway land,</i>


11
00:01:08.747 --> 00:01:11.624
<i>a young prince lived</i>
<i>in a shining castle.</i>


12
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.545
<i>Although he had everything</i>
<i>his heart desired,</i>


13
00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:20.550
<i>the prince was spoiled, selfish,</i>
<i>and unkind.</i>


14
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.803
<i>But then, one winter's night,</i>

15
00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:26.347
<i>an old beggar woman came</i>
<i>to the castle</i>


16
00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.476
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

17
00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:32.604
<i>in return for shelter</i>
<i>from the bitter cold.</i>


18
00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:35.356
<i>Repulsed by</i>
<i>her haggard appearance,</i>


19
00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:40.153
<i>the prince sneered at the gift</i>
<i>and turned the old woman away.</i>


20
00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:44.074
<i>But she warned him</i>
<i>not to be deceived by appearances,</i>


21
00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:47.035
<i>for beauty is found within.</i>

22
00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:49.162
<i>And when</i>
<i>he dismissed her again,</i>


23
00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:52.040
<i>the old woman's ugliness</i>
<i>melted away</i>


24
00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:55.418
<i>to reveal</i>
<i>a beautiful enchantress.</i>


25
00:01:56.169 --> 00:02:00.465
<i>The prince tried to apologize,</i>
<i>but it was too late, for she had seen</i>


26
00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:02.967
<i>that there was no love</i>
<i>in his heart.</i>


27
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.344
<i>And as punishment,</i>

28
00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:06.930
<i>she transformed him</i>
<i>into a hideous beast</i>


29
00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:11.851
<i>and placed a powerful spell on the castle</i>
<i>and all who lived there.</i>


30
00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:15.146
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form,</i>

31
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.651
<i>the Beast concealed himself</i>
<i>inside his castle with a magic mirror</i>


32
00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:22.487
<i>as his only window</i>
<i>to the outside world.</i>


33
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.868
<i>The rose she had offered</i>
<i>was truly an enchanted rose,</i>


34
00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:31.788
<i>which would bloom</i>
<i>until his 21st year.</i>


35
00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:37.544
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>
<i>and earn her love in return</i>


36
00:02:37.627 --> 00:02:40.130
<i>by the time</i>
<i>the last petal fell,</i>


37
00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:43.007
<i>then the spell</i>
<i>would be broken.</i>


38
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:49.681
<i>If not, he would be doomed</i>
<i>to remain a beast for all time.</i>


39
00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:52.892
<i>As the years passed,</i>

40
00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:57.814
<i>he fell into despair</i>
<i>and lost all hope,</i>


41
00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:03.194
<i>for who could ever learn</i>
<i>to love a beast?</i>


42
00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:34.642
Welcome, everyone,
to the 30th anniversary celebration


43
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:41.482
of Walt Disney Animation Studios'
Oscar-winning, animated masterpiece,


44
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.402
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

45
00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.155
You are in
for such a special treat


46
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.367
as we present the animated movie
we all know and love


47
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.747
with the musical numbers
reimagined


48
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.209
as live-action spectacles.

49
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.381
And for the Disney fan in all of us,
we are going to have


50
00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:08.801
some rare looks
behind the curtain,


51
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.805
showing you just how
this classic film came to be


52
00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:16.267
from right here
on the Disney Studios backlot,


53
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:20.855
where the inspiration first struck
to create this landmark film,


54
00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.149
one that has brought magic
into the lives


55
00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:26.319
of countless people
all around the globe.


56
00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.114
And that legacy began
on this very ground


57
00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:34.494
with an artist, an idea,
and a pencil.


58
00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:06.567
<i>Little town, it's a quiet village</i>

59
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:11.447
<i>Every day like the one before</i>

60
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.452
<i>Little town full of little people</i>

61
00:05:16.703 --> 00:05:21.624
<i>Waking up to say...</i>

62
00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:23.793
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>


63
00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.586
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>


64
00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:29.632
<i>There goes the baker</i>
<i>With his tray like always</i>


65
00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:32.844
<i>The same old bread and rolls to sell</i>

66
00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:36.597
<i>Every morning, just the same</i>
<i>Since the morning that we came</i>


67
00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:38.516
<i>To this poor provincial town</i>

68
00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:40.351
-Good morning, Belle.
-Good morning, monsieur.


69
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.270
-And where are you off to?
-The book shop.


70
00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:45.898
I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre.


71
00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:49.152
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up.


72
00:05:50.194 --> 00:05:51.571
<i>Look, there she goes</i>

73
00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:54.073
<i>That girl is strange, no question</i>

74
00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:57.327
<i>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell</i>

75
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.329
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

76
00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:01.164
<i>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</i>

77
00:06:01.247 --> 00:06:05.335
<i>No denying</i>
<i>She's a funny girl that Belle</i>


78
00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:07.295
-Bonjour
<i>-Good day</i>


79
00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:09.088
<i>How is your family</i>

80
00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:10.757
<i>-Bonjour</i>
<i>-Good day.</i>


81
00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:12.717
<i>How is your wife</i>

82
00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:16.346
<i>-I need six eggs</i>
<i>-That's too expensive</i>


83
00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:20.933
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>


84
00:06:21.017 --> 00:06:22.602
-Oh, Belle.
-Good morning.


85
00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:24.270
I've come to return
the book that I borrowed.


86
00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:26.647
-Finished already?
-Oh, I couldn't put it down.


87
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:29.359
-Have you got anything new?
-Not since yesterday.


88
00:06:29.442 --> 00:06:32.236
Oh, that's all right.
I'll borrow this one.


89
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.573
-That one? But you've read it twice.
-Well, it's my favorite.


90
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.702
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells,


91
00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:44.207
-a prince in disguise.
-If you like it all that much, it's yours.


92
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.042
-But madame...
-I insist.


93
00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:48.795
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.


94
00:06:50.463 --> 00:06:53.883
<i>Look, there she goes</i>
<i>That girl is so peculiar</i>


95
00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:57.261
<i>I wonder if she's feeling well</i>

96
00:06:57.345 --> 00:06:59.097
<i>With a dreamy, far-off look</i>

97
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.973
<i>And her nose stuck in a book</i>

98
00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:05.269
<i>What a puzzle</i>
<i>To the rest of us is Belle</i>


99
00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:07.814
<i>Oh</i>

100
00:07:07.897 --> 00:07:11.734
<i>Isn't this amazing</i>

101
00:07:11.818 --> 00:07:14.570
<i>It's my favorite part</i>

102
00:07:14.654 --> 00:07:21.577
<i>Because you'll see</i>

103
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:28.584
<i>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</i>

104
00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:33.131
<i>But she won't discover that it's him</i>

105
00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:38.136
<i>Till chapter three</i>

106
00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:41.889
<i>Now, it's no wonder</i>
<i>That her name means beauty</i>


107
00:07:41.973 --> 00:07:45.017
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

108
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:48.938
<i>But behind that fair façade</i>
<i>I'm afraid she's rather odd</i>


109
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:50.690
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

110
00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:52.775
<i>She's nothing like the rest of us</i>

111
00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:54.527
<i>Yes, different from the rest of us</i>

112
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.654
<i>Is Belle</i>

113
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:02.452
Ah! Wow!
You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.


114
00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:04.412
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!


115
00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:05.413
I know.

116
00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:07.582
No beast stands a chance
against you...


117
00:08:07.707 --> 00:08:10.334
-or any girl, for that matter.
-That's right, LeFou,


118
00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:12.712
and I've got my sights set
on that one.


119
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.088
The inventor's daughter?

120
00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:17.008
She's the one, the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.


121
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:18.634
-But she's...
-The most beautiful girl in town!


122
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.553
-I know!
-And that means she's the best.


123
00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:22.138
And don't I deserve the best?

124
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:24.724
Of course.
I mean, you do, but I mean...


125
00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:32.565
<i>Right from the moment that I met her</i>
<i>Saw her</i>


126
00:08:32.648 --> 00:08:33.858
<i>I said, "She's gorgeous"</i>

127
00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:35.902
<i>
-And I fell</i>

128
00:08:36.194 --> 00:08:39.864
<i>Here in town, there's only she</i>
<i>Who is beautiful as me</i>


129
00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:44.160
<i>So I'm making plans</i>
<i>To woo and marry Belle</i>


130
00:08:44.243 --> 00:08:47.830
<i>Look, there he goes</i>
<i>Isn't he dreamy</i>


131
00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:51.375
<i>Monsieur Gaston</i>
<i>Oh, he's so cute</i>


132
00:08:51.584 --> 00:08:54.879
<i>Be still, my heart</i>
<i>I'm hardly breathing</i>


133
00:08:54.962 --> 00:08:58.883
<i>He's such a tall, dark</i>
<i>Strong and handsome brute</i>


134
00:08:58.966 --> 00:08:59.884
-Bonjour.
-Pardon!


135
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:00.927
-Good day.

136
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.595
<i>You call this bacon</i>

137
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.638
<i>-Some cheese.</i>
<i>-Ten yards.</i>


138
00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:04.847
<i>-One pound.</i>
<i>-Excuse me!</i>


139
00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:06.474
-I'll get the knife
-Please let me through


140
00:09:06.557 --> 00:09:07.683
<i>This bread, it's stale</i>

141
00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:08.851
<i>-This fish</i>
<i>-They smell</i>


142
00:09:08.935 --> 00:09:10.436
<i>-Madame's mistaken</i>
<i>-Well, maybe so</i>


143
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.898
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>


144
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.443
<i>Just watch</i>
<i>I'm going to make Belle my wife</i>


145
00:09:17.568 --> 00:09:18.694
<i>Look, there she goes</i>

146
00:09:18.778 --> 00:09:21.030
<i>That girl is strange, but special</i>

147
00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:24.367
<i>A most peculiar mademoiselle</i>

148
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.244
<i>It's a pity and a sin</i>

149
00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:27.745
<i>She doesn't quite fit in</i>

150
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:31.916
<i>'Cause she really is a funny girl</i>
<i>A beauty, but a funny girl</i>


151
00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:36.837
<i>She really is a funny girl</i>

152
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:40.800
<i>That Belle</i>

153
00:09:40.883 --> 00:09:44.595
<i>That Belle</i>

154
00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:49.016
<i>That Belle</i>

155
00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.406
<i>Beauty and the Beast!</i>

156
00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.617
I'm a huge <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> fan.

157
00:10:06.742 --> 00:10:09.036
I've been listening to it
since I was a little kid.


158
00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:11.622
My first memory of seeing
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i>


159
00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:12.790
when it came out, I was ten.

160
00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:15.126
Most stories that touch your heart

161
00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:17.378
<i>when you're young,</i>
<i>you never want it to end,</i>


162
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.381
<i>and that's why another incarnation</i>
<i>is always exciting.</i>


163
00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:21.924
-Ow.

164
00:10:22.049 --> 00:10:25.928
I think it's gonna be really fun, man.
Just look at the cast.


165
00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:27.888
Oh, my gosh,
I love Shania Twain.


166
00:10:28.014 --> 00:10:31.601
-Oh, my... Martin Short.
-H.E.R. is brilliant.


167
00:10:31.726 --> 00:10:34.729
DAVID:<i>What I like most about H.E.R.</i>
<i>is she plays guitar, and she's good.</i>


168
00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:37.773
<i>This is the dream team</i>
<i>to end all dream teams.</i>


169
00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:39.900
It's the party of a lifetime.

170
00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:42.820
It's gonna be really, really special.
I can't wait.


171
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:58.628
One of my favorite parts
of tonight's celebration


172
00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:03.299
is the chance for all of us
to take a look behind the curtain


173
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:08.679
and experience <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>
the same way the film's animators did


174
00:11:08.763 --> 00:11:11.265
when they first put pencil
to paper.


175
00:11:11.724 --> 00:11:13.059
So here,

176
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:15.227
for the very first time,

177
00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:17.897
<i>is a scene</i>
<i>you will be familiar with,</i>


178
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.984
<i>only in a way you have never</i>
<i>experienced it before.</i>


179
00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:27.615
-MAURICE:<i>This is it, Belle!</i>

180
00:11:27.698 --> 00:11:29.367
<i>This time is it!</i>

181
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.286
<i>I'll win first prize</i>
<i>at the fair this year.</i>


182
00:11:33.412 --> 00:11:36.165
<i>Oh, Papa, it works!</i>

183
00:11:36.457 --> 00:11:38.709
<i>
-You did it!</i>

184
00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:40.211
<i>I always knew you were a genius!</i>

185
00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.464
MAURICE:<i>Well, I don't know</i>
<i>if I'd qualify as a...</i>


186
00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:45.174
-BELLE:<i>You'd better hurry.</i>

187
00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:46.342
<i>It's a long ride to the fair.</i>

188
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:48.094
<i>Goodbye, Papa! 
Good luck!</i>

189
00:11:48.177 --> 00:11:51.013
<i>Goodbye, Belle!</i>
<i>Take care while I'm gone!</i>


190
00:11:55.518 --> 00:11:57.228
-I should be there by now.

191
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.689
-Maybe we missed a turn.

192
00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:03.442
I guess I should have taken the...
wait a minute.


193
00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:06.987
Come on, Philippe.
It's a shortcut.


194
00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:17.415
-This can't be right.

195
00:12:17.498 --> 00:12:21.252
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.


196
00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.464
Steady.
Oh, no, Philippe!


197
00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:26.757
Oh, no.

198
00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:32.930
-Who's there?

199
00:12:34.473 --> 00:12:35.641
Is someone there?

200
00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:42.106
Show yourself at once!

201
00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:45.693
Oh, dear!

202
00:12:47.445 --> 00:12:48.988
Shoo! Help!

203
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.115
Philippe, help me!

204
00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:52.658
They're gonna eat me!

205
00:12:58.497 --> 00:12:59.540
Stay!

206
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.501
Oh, my!
Oh, no, no!


207
00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:12.219
Let's all calm down.

208
00:13:12.553 --> 00:13:14.889
Oh, dear. Enough.

209
00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:19.894
Help! Is someone there?

210
00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:31.280
-What?

211
00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:46.879
What is... Oh...

212
00:13:53.052 --> 00:13:54.094
Hello?

213
00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:58.474
Hello?

214
00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:00.768
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.


215
00:14:00.893 --> 00:14:03.854
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.


216
00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:06.315
Is someone there?

217
00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:09.819
Not a word, Lumière,
not one word.


218
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:14.824
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse, and...


219
00:14:14.907 --> 00:14:17.201
and I need a place to stay
for the night.


220
00:14:17.284 --> 00:14:20.371
-Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
-Shh!


221
00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:24.375
-Ah, ah, ah, ow!
-Oh, of course, monsieur,


222
00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:26.794
-you are welcome here.
-Who said that?


223
00:14:27.545 --> 00:14:29.755
-Over here!
-Where?


224
00:14:30.714 --> 00:14:32.049
-Hello.

225
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.763
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.


226
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:40.140
Stop that.
Stop that, I say.


227
00:14:40.724 --> 00:14:43.060
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur.


228
00:14:43.227 --> 00:14:46.188
-Come, warm yourself by the fire.
-<i>Thank you.</i>


229
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.607
COGSWORTH:<i>No, no, no.</i>

230
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:50.734
<i>You know what the master</i>
<i>will do if he finds him here.</i>


231
00:14:50.818 --> 00:14:53.195
I demand that you stop
right there.


232
00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:57.908
-Well, hello there, boy.

233
00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:04.707
What service.

234
00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:06.667
-All right...

235
00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.169
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?


236
00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:10.671
It'll warm you up in no time.

237
00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:13.966
No. No tea. No tea!

238
00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:19.096
His mustache tickles, Mama!

239
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:21.557
Oh!
Hello.


240
00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:28.147
-Uh-oh.

241
00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:39.199
-There's a stranger here.

242
00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.993
Master, allow me to explain.

243
00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:42.661
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.


244
00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:44.121
-He was cold and wet, so...

245
00:15:47.082 --> 00:15:50.127
Mm, Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say


246
00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:51.921
I was against this
from the start.


247
00:15:52.004 --> 00:15:53.589
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.


248
00:15:53.672 --> 00:15:54.882
Would they listen to me?
No, no...


249
00:15:57.927 --> 00:15:58.969
Is that...

250
00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:02.097
-Who are you?

251
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.265
What are you doing here?

252
00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:05.768
I-I-I was lost
in the woods, and...


253
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:09.271
-You are not welcome here!
-I-I-I'm sorry.


254
00:16:09.355 --> 00:16:12.149
-What are you staring at?
-N-nothing.


255
00:16:12.274 --> 00:16:15.736
So you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?


256
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.573
Please! I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay.


257
00:16:19.657 --> 00:16:24.370
-I'll give you a place to stay.
-No, no, please! No, no!


258
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.637
Gaston.
What a pleasant surprise.


259
00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:44.848
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.


260
00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:47.184
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town


261
00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:49.269
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.


262
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.439
This is the day... hmm...

263
00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:55.150
-Ah. This is the day

264
00:16:55.317 --> 00:16:56.819
your dreams come true.

265
00:16:57.194 --> 00:16:59.822
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?


266
00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:02.491
Plenty. Here, picture this.

267
00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:05.119
A rustic hunting lodge.

268
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:07.997
My latest kill
roasting on the fire.


269
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:11.625
And my little wife
massaging my feet,


270
00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:14.461
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.


271
00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:16.171
We'll have six or seven.

272
00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:18.298
-Dogs?
-No, Belle.


273
00:17:18.716 --> 00:17:21.010
-Strapping boys, like me.
-Imagine that.


274
00:17:21.385 --> 00:17:22.886
And do you know
who that little wife will be?


275
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.763
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.


276
00:17:24.972 --> 00:17:26.807
Gaston, I'm... I'm...

277
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:28.559
speechless.

278
00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:30.936
I really don't know
what to say.


279
00:17:31.353 --> 00:17:34.523
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...


280
00:17:35.566 --> 00:17:38.485
but I just don't deserve you.

281
00:17:38.569 --> 00:17:40.070
-Whoa!

282
00:17:46.076 --> 00:17:49.038
So how'd it go?

283
00:17:49.121 --> 00:17:51.665
I'll have Belle for my wife.

284
00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:54.918
-Make no mistake about that.

285
00:17:56.378 --> 00:17:57.880
-Touchy.

286
00:17:58.005 --> 00:18:00.841
" PLAYING)

287
00:18:02.676 --> 00:18:05.763
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.


288
00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:09.391
Me, the wife
of that boorish, brainless...


289
00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:13.645
<i>Madame Gaston</i>
<i>Can't you just see it</i>


290
00:18:13.729 --> 00:18:17.524
<i>Madame Gaston, his little wife</i>

291
00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:21.111
<i>No, sir, not me, 
I guarantee it</i>

292
00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:25.407
<i>I want much more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>


293
00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:43.967
<i>I want adventure</i>
<i>In the great wide, somewhere</i>


294
00:18:44.051 --> 00:18:48.055
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

295
00:19:56.456 --> 00:19:59.751
<i>And for once, it might be grand</i>

296
00:20:00.043 --> 00:20:04.006
<i>To have someone understand</i>

297
00:20:07.426 --> 00:20:09.511
<i>I want so much more</i>

298
00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:13.307
<i>Than they've got planned</i>

299
00:20:33.202 --> 00:20:34.453
Hello, hello.

300
00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:36.663
Now we are getting
into character, eh?


301
00:20:36.747 --> 00:20:39.291
Besides, they must
fall in love tonight


302
00:20:39.374 --> 00:20:41.210
if we ever expect
to be human again.


303
00:20:41.293 --> 00:20:44.213
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.


304
00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:46.173
-Philippe!

305
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.717
-What are you doing here? Where's...

306
00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:49.927
Where's Papa?

307
00:20:50.302 --> 00:20:52.596
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?


308
00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:55.599
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.


309
00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:11.490
What is this place?

310
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.619
Philippe, please. Steady.

311
00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:18.622
Steady.

312
00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:23.418
<i>Papa...</i>

313
00:21:26.129 --> 00:21:27.130
Hello?

314
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.093
Is anyone here?

315
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.930
Papa, are you here?

316
00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:37.975
Did you see that?

317
00:21:38.058 --> 00:21:41.019
-It's a girl!
-Yes, I can see it's a girl.


318
00:21:41.353 --> 00:21:43.146
But don't you see?
She's the one!


319
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.691
The girl we've been waiting for.
She's come to break the spell.


320
00:21:45.774 --> 00:21:47.901
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.


321
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.029
Didn't you invite the last guest in?
And you-know-who was furious.


322
00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:52.698
Why are you getting
so wound up?


323
00:21:52.864 --> 00:21:55.409
You're the one who keeps saying,
"Oh, all this waiting is making me


324
00:21:55.534 --> 00:21:57.911
go cuckoo, cuckoo."

325
00:21:58.578 --> 00:21:59.705
Clock jokes?

326
00:22:00.664 --> 00:22:02.708
Really, Lumière? You must have

327
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:04.626
burned the candle at both ends,
coming up with those.


328
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.628
Come on. The clock is ticking.

329
00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:09.506
Oh, that's clever.

330
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.008
My, you're a thinker.

331
00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:13.302
I would never have thought
you could do that.


332
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.017
Papa?

333
00:22:20.684 --> 00:22:22.185
Belle?

334
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.982
Oh, you must leave here at once.
Now, go before he finds you.


335
00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:30.402
-Who?
-What are you doing here?


336
00:22:30.736 --> 00:22:33.280
-Run, Belle.
-I've come for my father.


337
00:22:33.655 --> 00:22:35.240
-Please let him out.

338
00:22:35.324 --> 00:22:36.742
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:22:36.825 --> 00:22:39.119
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here.


340
00:22:39.328 --> 00:22:42.497
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.


341
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:44.416
There must be some way I can...

342
00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:46.585
-Wait.

343
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:48.795
Take me instead.

344
00:22:49.588 --> 00:22:52.299
You... would take his place?

345
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:55.302
Belle, no.
You don't know what you're doing.


346
00:22:56.011 --> 00:22:57.554
If I agree,

347
00:22:58.597 --> 00:23:02.225
you must promise to stay here
forever.


348
00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:05.729
Come into the light.

349
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:19.201
Belle. I won't let you do this.

350
00:23:24.164 --> 00:23:25.332
You have my word.

351
00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:27.334
Done.

352
00:23:28.377 --> 00:23:29.294
No, Belle!

353
00:23:34.216 --> 00:23:36.843
No, please spare my daughter.
Please!


354
00:23:36.927 --> 00:23:38.595
She's no longer your concern.

355
00:23:38.762 --> 00:23:40.430
-Take him to the village.

356
00:23:40.514 --> 00:23:43.016
Let me out!
Please let me out!


357
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.144
Let me out, please!

358
00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:47.813
Please!

359
00:23:49.106 --> 00:23:51.108
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.


360
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:53.110
I'll never see him again.

361
00:23:53.193 --> 00:23:55.904
And I didn't get
to say goodbye.


362
00:23:57.364 --> 00:24:00.409
-I'll show you to your room.
-My room?


363
00:24:01.118 --> 00:24:02.202
But I thought...

364
00:24:02.452 --> 00:24:04.496
You wanna...
you wanna stay in the tower?


365
00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:06.081
-No.
-Then follow me.


366
00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:20.345
Say something to her.

367
00:24:20.595 --> 00:24:22.973
Huh? Oh. I...

368
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.308
hope you like it here.

369
00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:30.480
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like


370
00:24:30.605 --> 00:24:32.107
except the west wing.

371
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.234
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!


372
00:24:41.575 --> 00:24:42.909
Now, if you need anything,

373
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.036
my servants will attend you.

374
00:24:45.162 --> 00:24:46.538
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.


375
00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:50.083
You will join me for dinner.

376
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:51.334
That's not a request!

377
00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:19.237
Who does she think she is?

378
00:25:19.488 --> 00:25:21.364
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man!


379
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.452
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.


380
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.290
Dismissed, rejected,
publicly humiliated!


381
00:25:30.624 --> 00:25:33.084
-It's more than I can bear.
-More beer?


382
00:25:33.168 --> 00:25:35.128
What for? Nothing helps.

383
00:25:35.879 --> 00:25:39.633
-I'm disgraced.
-Who, you? Never!


384
00:25:39.883 --> 00:25:42.469
Gaston, you gotta
pull yourself together.


385
00:25:42.552 --> 00:25:44.471
<i>
-Gosh, it disturbs me</i>

386
00:25:44.554 --> 00:25:45.972
<i>To see you, Gaston</i>

387
00:25:46.097 --> 00:25:48.475
<i>Looking so down in the dumps</i>

388
00:25:48.725 --> 00:25:50.894
-<i>Every guy here'd love</i>

389
00:25:51.102 --> 00:25:55.148
<i>To be you, Gaston,</i>
<i>even when taking your lumps</i>


390
00:25:55.774 --> 00:25:58.693
<i>There's no man in town</i>
<i>As admired as you</i>


391
00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:01.363
<i>You're everyone's favorite guy</i>

392
00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:05.450
<i>Everyone's awed and inspired by you</i>

393
00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:09.204
<i>And it's not very hard</i>

394
00:26:09.287 --> 00:26:12.666
<i>To see why</i>

395
00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:19.089
<i>
-No one's slick as Gaston</i>

396
00:26:19.172 --> 00:26:20.590
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

397
00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:23.843
<i>No one's neck's as incredibly</i>
<i>Thick as Gaston's</i>


398
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.597
<i>For there's no man in town</i>
<i>Half as manly...</i>


399
00:26:27.764 --> 00:26:30.392
<i>Perfect, a pure paragon</i>

400
00:26:30.517 --> 00:26:33.645
<i>You can ask any Tom, 
Dick, or Stanley</i>

401
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.774
<i>And they'll tell you whose team</i>
<i>They prefer to be on</i>


402
00:26:39.317 --> 00:26:43.738
<i>No one's big like Gaston</i>

403
00:26:43.822 --> 00:26:45.323
<i>A kingpin like Gaston</i>

404
00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:48.159
<i>No one's got a swell cleft</i>
<i>In his chin like Gaston</i>


405
00:26:48.618 --> 00:26:52.539
<i>As a specimen, yes,</i>
<i>I'm intimidating</i>


406
00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:55.458
<i>My what a guy that Gaston</i>

407
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:58.878
<i>Give five hurrahs, give 12 hip-hips</i>

408
00:26:58.962 --> 00:27:00.630
<i>Gaston is the best</i>

409
00:27:00.714 --> 00:27:03.592
<i>-And the rest is all drips</i>
-Yeah. Oh.


410
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.722
ALL:
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>


411
00:27:08.805 --> 00:27:10.432
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

412
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.144
<i>In a wrestling match</i>
<i>Nobody fights like Gaston</i>


413
00:27:14.227 --> 00:27:17.188
<i>For there's no one as burly and brawny</i>

414
00:27:17.272 --> 00:27:19.899
<i>As you see I've got biceps to spare</i>

415
00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:23.320
<i>Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny</i>

416
00:27:23.403 --> 00:27:24.362
That's right!

417
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:27.616
<i>And every last inch of me's</i>
<i>Covered with hair</i>


418
00:27:27.699 --> 00:27:30.785
<i>No one hits like Gaston</i>
<i>Matches wits like Gaston</i>


419
00:27:30.869 --> 00:27:33.997
<i>In a spitting match,</i>
<i>Nobody spits like Gaston</i>


420
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.500
<i>I'm especially good at expectorating</i>

421
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:40.795
-Ptooey!
-ALL:<i>Ten points for Gaston</i>


422
00:27:41.046 --> 00:27:43.882
<i>When I was a lad,</i>
<i>I ate four dozen eggs</i>


423
00:27:44.007 --> 00:27:46.676
<i>Every morning to help me get large</i>

424
00:27:47.719 --> 00:27:50.555
<i>And now that I'm grown</i>
<i>I eat five dozen eggs</i>


425
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:57.896
<i>So I'm roughly the size</i>
<i>Of a barge</i>


426
00:28:31.179 --> 00:28:34.808
<i>No one shoots like Gaston</i>

427
00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:36.309
-No one!
-<i>Makes those beauts</i>


428
00:28:36.393 --> 00:28:38.478
<i>-Like Gaston</i>
<i>-Then goes tromping around</i>


429
00:28:38.645 --> 00:28:40.397
<i>Wearing boots like Gaston</i>

430
00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:44.442
<i>I use antlers</i>
<i>In all of my decorating</i>


431
00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:46.695
<i>My what a guy</i>

432
00:28:46.986 --> 00:28:52.951
<i>Gaston</i>

433
00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:03.795
Help! Someone help me!
He's got her.


434
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.047
He's got her locked
in a dungeon.


435
00:29:06.297 --> 00:29:08.675
Oh, we must go.
Not a minute to lose!


436
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.552
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Maurice.


437
00:29:10.635 --> 00:29:12.887
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!


438
00:29:13.304 --> 00:29:16.266
A horrible, monstrous beast!

439
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.479
My daughter's life is in danger.
Why do you laugh?


440
00:29:23.148 --> 00:29:24.649
The Beast is real!

441
00:29:25.233 --> 00:29:26.443
Will no one help me?

442
00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.862
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.


443
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.781
Oh, you will?
Oh, thank you. Oh. Thank you.


444
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.159
Thank you.

445
00:29:34.242 --> 00:29:36.494
-Crazy old Maurice.

446
00:29:36.578 --> 00:29:38.288
He's always good for a laugh.

447
00:29:38.538 --> 00:29:41.124
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

448
00:29:41.374 --> 00:29:43.126
Crazy old Maurice.

449
00:29:43.209 --> 00:29:44.919
Hmm...

450
00:29:48.548 --> 00:29:51.134
<i>
-LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking</i>

451
00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:53.595
A dangerous pastime.

452
00:29:53.678 --> 00:29:54.971
-I know.

453
00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:58.099
<i>But that wacky old coot is Belle's father</i>

454
00:29:58.683 --> 00:30:01.269
<i>And his sanity's only so-so</i>

455
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.856
<i>Now the wheels in my head</i>
<i>Have been turning</i>


456
00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:08.109
<i>
-Since I looked at that loony old man</i>

457
00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:11.654
<i>See, I promised myself</i>
<i>I'd be married to Belle</i>


458
00:30:11.821 --> 00:30:15.825
<i>And right now</i>
<i>I'm evolving a plan</i>


459
00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:18.536
-If I...
-Yes?


460
00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:19.662
-Then we...
-No, will she?


461
00:30:19.788 --> 00:30:21.539
-Yes.
-Now I get it.


462
00:30:21.998 --> 00:30:24.501
Let's go!

463
00:30:25.502 --> 00:30:29.464
<i>No one plots like Gaston</i>

464
00:30:29.547 --> 00:30:31.174
<i>Takes cheap shots like Gaston</i>

465
00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:34.636
<i>Plans to persecute harmless</i>
<i>Crackpots like Gaston</i>


466
00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:40.475
<i>So his marriage</i>
<i>We soon will be celebrating</i>


467
00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:47.440
<i>My, what a guy, Gaston</i>

468
00:30:54.531 --> 00:30:55.657
Hmm?

469
00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:13.633
There has to be some way
we can cheer up Belle.


470
00:31:14.342 --> 00:31:17.554
-Help her see the bright side.
-I've got it!


471
00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:21.349
Why don't you show her
your little TikTok dance?


472
00:31:21.432 --> 00:31:22.851
That always cheers me up.

473
00:31:23.017 --> 00:31:24.894
It's not a dance.
It's the way I walk.


474
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:26.896
And tick-tock is the sound
I make when I move.


475
00:31:27.063 --> 00:31:28.064
Ah.

476
00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:34.612
Oh, I'm suddenly happy.

477
00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:42.203
-Who is it?
-MRS. POTTS: Mrs. Potts, dear.


478
00:31:44.414 --> 00:31:45.582
-I thought you might like...

479
00:31:45.665 --> 00:31:47.333
-A spot of tea.
-But you're...


480
00:31:47.584 --> 00:31:50.128
-you're a...
-Oh!


481
00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:52.338
-Careful.
-This is impossible.


482
00:31:52.672 --> 00:31:55.300
I know it is, but here we are.

483
00:31:55.508 --> 00:31:57.886
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.


484
00:31:58.094 --> 00:31:59.429
We all think so.

485
00:31:59.554 --> 00:32:03.099
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.


486
00:32:03.266 --> 00:32:04.893
Cheer up, child.

487
00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:08.980
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.


488
00:32:09.355 --> 00:32:11.190
Oh, listen to me, jabbering on

489
00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:13.192
while there's a supper
to get on the table.


490
00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:14.277
Chip!

491
00:32:15.403 --> 00:32:16.487
Bye!

492
00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:19.490
What's taking so long?

493
00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:23.411
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?


494
00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:25.246
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

495
00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:28.833
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.


496
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:31.878
Master, have you thought
that perhaps this girl


497
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:34.631
-could be the one to break the spell?
-Of course I have!


498
00:32:35.006 --> 00:32:36.925
-I'm not a fool.
-Good.


499
00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:40.762
So you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you,


500
00:32:40.845 --> 00:32:42.722
and poof, the spell is broken.

501
00:32:42.805 --> 00:32:44.724
We'll be human again
by midnight.


502
00:32:44.807 --> 00:32:47.727
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumière.
These things take time.


503
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.938
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.


504
00:32:50.021 --> 00:32:51.648
Oh, it's no use.

505
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.108
She's so beautiful, and I'm...

506
00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:55.944
well, look at me!

507
00:32:58.363 --> 00:33:01.074
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.


508
00:33:01.407 --> 00:33:02.492
I don't know how.

509
00:33:03.534 --> 00:33:06.037
Well, you can start by making yourself
more presentable.


510
00:33:06.287 --> 00:33:08.331
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.


511
00:33:08.414 --> 00:33:12.126
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.


512
00:33:12.585 --> 00:33:13.962
Come, come. Show me the smile.

513
00:33:14.712 --> 00:33:19.092
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.


514
00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:20.259
But be gentle.

515
00:33:20.677 --> 00:33:22.762
-Shower her with compliments.
-MRS. POTTS: But be sincere.


516
00:33:22.845 --> 00:33:24.138
And above all...

517
00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:26.349
You must control your temper.

518
00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:28.559
-Here she is.

519
00:33:30.687 --> 00:33:31.980
Good evening.

520
00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:34.774
Well? Where is she?

521
00:33:35.942 --> 00:33:36.901
What?

522
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.363
<i>But Your Grace, 
Your Eminence...</i>

523
00:33:41.072 --> 00:33:42.657
<i>let's not be hasty!</i>

524
00:33:45.493 --> 00:33:47.245
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner.


525
00:33:47.412 --> 00:33:48.538
I'm not hungry.

526
00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:52.667
You'll come out, or I'll...
I'll... I'll break down the door!


527
00:33:53.042 --> 00:33:55.545
Master, I could be wrong,
but, uh...


528
00:33:55.628 --> 00:33:59.132
That may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.


529
00:33:59.298 --> 00:34:02.677
Please, attempt to be a gentleman.

530
00:34:02.885 --> 00:34:06.055
It would give me
great pleasure


531
00:34:07.098 --> 00:34:08.891
if you would join me
for dinner.


532
00:34:08.975 --> 00:34:10.018
We say please.

533
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.478
-Please.
-No, thank you.


534
00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:14.188
You can't stay in there forever.

535
00:34:14.272 --> 00:34:16.190
-Yes, I can.
-Fine!


536
00:34:16.274 --> 00:34:19.569
Then go ahead and starve!

537
00:34:19.736 --> 00:34:21.571
If she doesn't eat with me,

538
00:34:22.113 --> 00:34:23.906
then she doesn't eat at all.

539
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:28.536
-Oh, dear.

540
00:34:28.661 --> 00:34:30.246
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?


541
00:34:32.457 --> 00:34:35.084
What does she want me to do? Beg?

542
00:34:41.507 --> 00:34:42.800
Show me the girl.

543
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:46.763
<i>But the master's really not so bad</i>
<i>once you get to know him.</i>


544
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.057
<i>Why don't you give him</i>
<i>a chance?</i>


545
00:34:49.265 --> 00:34:50.892
<i>I don't want to get to know him.</i>

546
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.227
<i>I don't want to have</i>
<i>anything to do with him.</i>


547
00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:57.857
I'm just fooling myself.

548
00:34:58.733 --> 00:35:02.111
She'll never see me as anything
but a monster.


549
00:35:06.908 --> 00:35:07.909
It's hopeless.

550
00:36:37.498 --> 00:36:40.626
The falling petals
of an enchanted rose,


551
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.296
each one a graceful reminder

552
00:36:43.421 --> 00:36:47.258
that love is as fragile
as it is enduring,


553
00:36:47.675 --> 00:36:52.430
as difficult to find
as it is a wonder to hold onto.


554
00:36:52.972 --> 00:36:56.017
That true love can overcome
any obstacles


555
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.270
no matter how impossible
they may seem.


556
00:36:59.979 --> 00:37:03.566
<i>It is this idea that inspired</i>
<i>Walt Disney himself</i>


557
00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:06.736
<i>to want to tell the story</i>
<i>of</i>Beauty and the Beast


558
00:37:06.819 --> 00:37:09.113
<i>as far back as the 1930s.</i>

559
00:37:10.156 --> 00:37:14.994
<i>For decades, Disney artists worked</i>
<i>to adapt this tale as old as time,</i>


560
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:18.497
<i>yet something was always missing</i>
<i>from these early efforts.</i>


561
00:37:18.915 --> 00:37:23.127
<i>Then, more than 50 years</i>
<i>after inspiration first struck,</i>


562
00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:28.466
<i>a team came together that was just</i>
<i>as special as the fairy tale itself.</i>


563
00:37:28.716 --> 00:37:30.801
<i>Dancing again, we'll be twirling again</i>

564
00:37:30.885 --> 00:37:31.844
-Yeah.
-Want that faster?


565
00:37:31.928 --> 00:37:34.222
-Yeah.
<i>-Composer Alan Menken,</i>

<i>lyricist Howard Ashman,</i>

567

569
00:37:41.479 --> 00:37:46.275

00:37:46.359 --> 00:37:49.987

573
00:37:57.787 --> 00:38:00.706
<i>Roy Disney himself wrote</i>
<i>the film's prologue.</i>


574
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.459
<i>Together, they embraced</i>
<i>all the joy</i>


575
00:38:03.542 --> 00:38:06.379
<i>of Belle becoming the hero</i>
<i>of her own story...</i>


576
00:38:06.504 --> 00:38:09.215
I want excitement
and adventure in my life.


577
00:38:09.882 --> 00:38:12.009
And I want someone
to share it with.


578
00:38:12.176 --> 00:38:16.013
<i>And the magic of the Beast</i>
<i>and his enchanted castle.</i>


579
00:38:16.555 --> 00:38:18.349
Beauty and the Beast <i>has become</i>

580
00:38:18.432 --> 00:38:23.020
one of the most beloved
animated classics ever made.


581
00:38:23.562 --> 00:38:27.733
It was even
the first animated film ever


582
00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:31.445
to be nominated for Best Picture
at the Academy Awards.


583
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:33.781
And to this day,

584
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:39.203
Walt Disney's original idea
continues to inspire us all.


585
00:38:48.921 --> 00:38:52.174
<i>Come on, Chip, into the cupboard</i>
<i>with your brothers and sisters.</i>


586
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.929
-But I'm not sleepy.
-Yes, you are.


587
00:38:57.054 --> 00:38:58.806
-No, I'm not.

588
00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:01.934
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.


589
00:39:02.018 --> 00:39:03.602
After all, he did say "please."

590
00:39:03.686 --> 00:39:06.480
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,


591
00:39:06.564 --> 00:39:08.899
-He'll never break...
-Splendid to see you


592
00:39:08.983 --> 00:39:10.192
out and about, mademoiselle.

593
00:39:10.735 --> 00:39:13.112
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.


594
00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:15.031
-Ah.

595
00:39:15.573 --> 00:39:18.451
-This is Lumière.
<i>-Enchanté, chérie.</i>


596
00:39:18.784 --> 00:39:22.496
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do


597
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.165
to make your stay
more comfortable...


598
00:39:24.248 --> 00:39:25.249
-Ow!

599
00:39:25.374 --> 00:39:27.543
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?


600
00:39:27.752 --> 00:39:29.337
Hear that? She's hungry.

601
00:39:29.712 --> 00:39:32.465
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.


602
00:39:32.798 --> 00:39:35.051
Remember what the master said?

603
00:39:35.217 --> 00:39:38.387
Oh, pish-posh. I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.


604
00:39:38.554 --> 00:39:39.847
All right, fine.

605
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.474
Glass of water, crust of bread,
and then...


606
00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:43.934
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

607
00:39:44.226 --> 00:39:46.604
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest.


608
00:39:46.771 --> 00:39:48.731
We must make her feel
welcome here.


609
00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:52.109
-Right this way, mademoiselle.
-Well, keep it down.


610
00:39:52.526 --> 00:39:54.904
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.


611
00:39:54.987 --> 00:39:56.530
Of course, of course.

612
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:59.742
But what is dinner
without a little music?


613
00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:01.452
-Music?

614
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:05.790
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle,</i>

615
00:40:05.873 --> 00:40:08.834
it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure


616
00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:11.837
that we welcome you
here tonight.


617
00:40:12.254 --> 00:40:16.092
And now we invite you
to relax and to pull up a chair


618
00:40:16.175 --> 00:40:21.389
as the dining room
proudly presents your dinner.


619
00:40:22.807 --> 00:40:26.685
<i>Be our guest</i>

620
00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:30.106
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Put our service to the test</i>


621
00:40:30.314 --> 00:40:34.527
<i>Tie a napkin 'round your neck, chérie</i>
<i>And we'll provide the rest</i>


622
00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:37.488
<i>Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres</i>

623
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:39.532
<i>Why, we only live to serve</i>

624
00:40:39.615 --> 00:40:41.784
<i>Try the gray stuff, it's delicious</i>

625
00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:43.702
<i>Don't believe me</i>
<i>Ask the dishes</i>


626
00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:48.791
<i>They can sing, they can dance</i>
<i>After all, miss, this is France</i>


627
00:40:48.874 --> 00:40:52.795
<i>And a dinner here is never second best</i>

628
00:40:52.878 --> 00:40:55.131
<i>Go on, unfold your menu</i>

629
00:40:55.214 --> 00:40:58.300
<i>Take a glance</i>
<i>And then you'll be our guest</i>


630
00:40:58.592 --> 00:41:01.387
Oui,<i>our guest, be our guest</i>

631
00:41:01.762 --> 00:41:06.183
<i>Beef ragout, cheese soufflé</i>
<i>Pie and pudding en flambé</i>


632
00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:10.479
<i>We'll prepare and serve with flair</i>
<i>A culinary cabaret</i>


633
00:41:10.563 --> 00:41:14.859
<i>You're alone and you're scared</i>
<i>But the banquet's all prepared</i>


634
00:41:14.942 --> 00:41:19.405
<i>No one's gloomy or complaining</i>
<i>While the flatware is entertaining</i>


635
00:41:19.697 --> 00:41:23.409
<i>We tell jokes, I do tricks</i>
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>


636
00:41:23.492 --> 00:41:27.288
<i>And it's all in perfect taste</i>
<i>That you can bet</i>


637
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:29.373
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

638
00:41:29.457 --> 00:41:31.625
<i>You've won your own free pass</i>

639
00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:33.127
<i>To be our guest</i>

640
00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.963
<i>If you're stressed</i>
<i>It's fine dining we suggest</i>


641
00:41:36.088 --> 00:41:39.842
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>


642
00:41:41.427 --> 00:41:43.846
<i>Life is so unnerving</i>

643
00:41:44.054 --> 00:41:46.390
<i>For a servant who's not serving</i>

644
00:41:46.515 --> 00:41:50.060
<i>He's not whole without
a soul to wait upon</i>

645
00:41:51.312 --> 00:41:55.608
<i>Oh, those good old days</i>
<i>When we were useful</i>


646
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.487
<i>Suddenly those good old days are gone</i>

647
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:05.326
<i>Ten years we've been rusting</i>
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>


648
00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:09.538
<i>Needing exercise</i>
<i>A chance to use our skills</i>


649
00:42:11.081 --> 00:42:15.419
<i>Most days we just lay</i>
<i>Around the castle</i>


650
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:19.798
<i>Flabby, fat, and lazy</i>
<i>You walked in and oopsie-daisy</i>


651
00:42:20.758 --> 00:42:22.593
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle,</i>

652
00:42:22.676 --> 00:42:26.138
it is my honor to present
my favorite cup of tea,


653
00:42:26.388 --> 00:42:28.933
the incomparable Mrs. Potts.

654
00:42:29.266 --> 00:42:31.185
<i>It's a guest, it's a guest</i>

655
00:42:31.352 --> 00:42:32.770
<i>Sakes alive and I'll be blessed</i>

656
00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:34.897
<i>Wine's been poured</i>
<i>And thank the Lord</i>


657
00:42:35.064 --> 00:42:36.899
<i>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

658
00:42:37.066 --> 00:42:40.486
<i>With dessert, she'll want tea</i>
<i>And my dear, that's fine with me</i>


659
00:42:40.778 --> 00:42:44.740
<i>While the cups do their soft-shoein'</i>
<i>I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'</i>


660
00:42:44.823 --> 00:42:48.494
<i>I'll get warm, piping hot</i>
<i>Heaven's sakes, is that a spot</i>


661
00:42:48.661 --> 00:42:51.997
<i>Clean it up,</i>
<i>We want the company impressed</i>


662
00:42:52.164 --> 00:42:56.001
<i>We've got a lot to do</i>
<i>Is it one lump or two</i>


663
00:42:56.168 --> 00:42:57.670
<i>For you, our guest</i>

664
00:42:57.753 --> 00:42:59.463
<i>-She's our guest</i>
<i>-Oh, she's our guest</i>


665
00:42:59.547 --> 00:43:02.007
-<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest, be our guest</i>


666
00:43:02.132 --> 00:43:03.759
<i>Our command is your request</i>

667
00:43:03.926 --> 00:43:07.513
<i>It's been years since we've had</i>
<i>Anybody here and we're obsessed</i>


668
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.433
<i>With your meal, with your ease</i>
<i>Yes, indeed we aim to please</i>


669
00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:14.436
<i>While candlelight's still glowing</i>

670
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.233
<i>Let us help you, we'll keep going</i>

671
00:43:19.316 --> 00:43:22.611
<i>Course by course</i>

672
00:43:23.612 --> 00:43:25.322
<i>One by one</i>

673
00:43:25.864 --> 00:43:28.200
<i>Till you shout, enough, I'm done</i>

674
00:43:28.325 --> 00:43:31.912
<i>Then we'll sing you</i>
<i>Off to sleep as you digest</i>


675
00:43:32.454 --> 00:43:36.208
<i>Tonight you'll prop your feet up</i>
<i>But for now, let's eat up</i>


676
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.585
<i>-Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>


677
00:43:37.793 --> 00:43:39.712
-<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>


678
00:43:39.878 --> 00:43:40.921
<i>Be our guest</i>

679
00:43:41.463 --> 00:43:47.595
<i>Please, be our guest</i>

680
00:43:59.815 --> 00:44:02.276
Bravo.
That was wonderful.


681
00:44:02.443 --> 00:44:05.571
Thank you, mademoiselle.
It was wonderful. Wasn't it, everyone?


682
00:44:07.656 --> 00:44:11.535
Will you look at the time?
Off to bed, off to bed.


683
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:15.331
I'd like to look around.
Perhaps you'd like to take me?


684
00:44:15.581 --> 00:44:18.792
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.


685
00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:20.878
Well, actually, yes, I do.

686
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:24.965
Right this way.

687
00:44:26.258 --> 00:44:27.593
-As you can see...

688
00:44:27.676 --> 00:44:32.306
The pseudo façade was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist Rococo design.


689
00:44:32.514 --> 00:44:33.807
-Note the unusual...

690
00:44:33.891 --> 00:44:35.267
...inverted vaulted ceilings.

691
00:44:35.434 --> 00:44:38.979
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.


692
00:44:39.188 --> 00:44:42.608
And as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.


693
00:44:44.693 --> 00:44:46.070
Mm. Uh, where was I?

694
00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:49.531
-As you were.

695
00:44:49.782 --> 00:44:51.909
Now then, if I may draw
your attention


696
00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:54.161
to the flying buttresses
above the...


697
00:44:54.662 --> 00:44:55.913
uh, mademoiselle?

698
00:45:01.752 --> 00:45:04.088
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Oh, nothing.


699
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.298
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.


700
00:45:06.382 --> 00:45:08.467
Dusty, dull, very boring.

701
00:45:09.134 --> 00:45:11.428
Ah, so that's the west wing.

702
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.056
-Nice going.

703
00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:17.267
-I wonder what he's hiding up there.
-Hiding?


704
00:45:17.351 --> 00:45:19.186
The...the master
is hiding nothing.


705
00:45:19.311 --> 00:45:20.604
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

706
00:45:20.688 --> 00:45:23.649
Perhaps, uh, mademoiselle
would like to, uh, uh,


707
00:45:23.732 --> 00:45:24.983
uh, see something else?

708
00:45:25.234 --> 00:45:27.736
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...


709
00:45:27.861 --> 00:45:30.114
-Maybe later.
-Uh, the-the gardens?


710
00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:33.450
-Or-or the-the-the library, perhaps?
-You have a library?


711
00:45:33.575 --> 00:45:35.661
Yes! Ye...oh, indeed.

712
00:45:35.744 --> 00:45:37.579
-With books.
-Scads of books.


713
00:45:37.663 --> 00:45:39.790
-Mountains of books.
-Forests of books.


714
00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:41.041
-Cascades.
-Cloudbursts.


715
00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:42.334
-Swamps of books.

716
00:45:42.418 --> 00:45:44.670
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.


717
00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:46.755
Books on every subject
ever studied,


718
00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:49.049
by every author
whoever set pen to paper.


719
00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:15.409
-Oh.

720
00:47:02.247 --> 00:47:05.334
-Why did you come here?
-I...I'm sorry.


721
00:47:05.417 --> 00:47:09.254
-I warned you never to come here.
-I didn't mean any harm.


722
00:47:09.338 --> 00:47:11.965
Do you realize
what you could have done?


723
00:47:12.049 --> 00:47:14.301
-Please, stop.

724
00:47:14.426 --> 00:47:16.637
-Get out!
-No!


725
00:47:18.806 --> 00:47:20.516
Get out!

726
00:47:49.294 --> 00:47:51.463
Okay. Okay.

727
00:47:51.964 --> 00:47:53.006
Okay.

728
00:48:05.727 --> 00:48:07.563
Okay.

729
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.980
You saved me.

730
00:49:19.801 --> 00:49:21.803
Here, now. Oh, don't do that.

731
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:29.394
-Just hold still.

732
00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:31.480
-That hurts!
-If you'd hold still,


733
00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:32.689
it wouldn't hurt as much.

734
00:49:32.814 --> 00:49:34.858
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.


735
00:49:35.067 --> 00:49:37.736
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.


736
00:49:38.904 --> 00:49:41.365
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.


737
00:49:41.448 --> 00:49:43.533
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.


738
00:49:47.287 --> 00:49:48.664
Now hold still.

739
00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:52.417
-This might sting a little.
-Hmm?


740
00:49:53.502 --> 00:49:57.589
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.


741
00:50:02.302 --> 00:50:03.553
You're welcome.

742
00:50:07.516 --> 00:50:08.850
GASTON:<i>It's like this.</i>

743
00:50:09.059 --> 00:50:11.687
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.


744
00:50:11.979 --> 00:50:14.856
But she needs
a little persuasion.


745
00:50:14.982 --> 00:50:17.859
So you want me to throw
her father into the asylum


746
00:50:17.943 --> 00:50:20.195
<i>unless she agrees</i>
<i>to marry you?</i>


747
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:23.448
<i>Oh, that is despicable.</i>

748
00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:25.993
<i>I love it.</i>

749
00:50:28.662 --> 00:50:31.665
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.


750
00:50:31.748 --> 00:50:34.793
Yeah. Is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.


751
00:50:34.876 --> 00:50:36.253
I'll find that castle,

752
00:50:36.336 --> 00:50:39.089
and somehow,
I'll get her out of there.


753
00:50:59.693 --> 00:51:02.279
I've never felt this way
about anyone.


754
00:51:04.322 --> 00:51:05.907
I want to do something for her.

755
00:51:07.117 --> 00:51:08.035
But what?

756
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:09.953
Well, there's the usual things...

757
00:51:10.037 --> 00:51:13.582
flowers, chocolates, promises
you don't intend to keep.


758
00:51:13.665 --> 00:51:17.669
Ah, no, no.
It has to be something very special.


759
00:51:18.003 --> 00:51:20.088
Something that sparks
her interest.


760
00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:21.214
Wait a minute!

761
00:51:23.717 --> 00:51:24.885
Belle...

762
00:51:25.677 --> 00:51:27.637
there's something
I want to show you.


763
00:51:29.848 --> 00:51:32.059
But first,
you have to close your eyes.


764
00:51:34.686 --> 00:51:35.771
It's a surprise.

765
00:51:47.032 --> 00:51:49.576
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.


766
00:51:50.952 --> 00:51:51.953
Wait here.

767
00:51:57.542 --> 00:51:58.835
Now can I open them?

768
00:51:59.252 --> 00:52:01.755
All right. Now.

769
00:52:10.263 --> 00:52:11.890
I can't believe it.

770
00:52:12.933 --> 00:52:14.976
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.


771
00:52:15.185 --> 00:52:18.396
-You... you like it?
-It's wonderful.


772
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.648
Then it's yours.

773
00:52:20.357 --> 00:52:22.359
Oh, thank you so much.

774
00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:23.860
Would you look at that?

775
00:52:23.944 --> 00:52:25.862
I knew it would work.

776
00:52:25.946 --> 00:52:28.281
-What? What worked?

777
00:52:28.365 --> 00:52:30.408
It's very encouraging.

778
00:52:30.492 --> 00:52:33.120
-Isn't this exciting?
-I didn't see anything.


779
00:52:33.203 --> 00:52:36.248
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.


780
00:52:36.414 --> 00:52:40.168
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.


781
00:53:38.351 --> 00:53:42.105
<i>There's something sweet and almost kind</i>

782
00:53:42.189 --> 00:53:45.942
<i>But he was mean and he was</i>
<i>Coarse and unrefined</i>


783
00:53:46.026 --> 00:53:49.196
<i>And now he's dear and so unsure</i>

784
00:53:49.946 --> 00:53:54.075
<i>I wonder why I
didn't see it there before</i>

785
00:54:06.838 --> 00:54:10.300
<i>She glanced this way,</i>
<i>I thought I saw</i>


786
00:54:10.884 --> 00:54:14.512
<i>And when we touched</i>
<i>She didn't shudder at my paw</i>


787
00:54:14.638 --> 00:54:16.056
<i>No, it can't be</i>

788
00:54:16.389 --> 00:54:17.933
<i>I'll just ignore</i>

789
00:54:18.558 --> 00:54:22.312
<i>But then she's never looked</i>
<i>At me that way before</i>


790
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:31.154
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

791
00:54:31.238 --> 00:54:33.782
<i>Who'd have ever thought</i>

792
00:54:33.865 --> 00:54:39.579
<i>That this could be</i>

793
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:46.086
<i>True that he's no Prince Charming</i>

794
00:54:46.753 --> 00:54:49.297
<i>But there's something in him</i>

795
00:54:49.464 --> 00:54:53.885
<i>That I simply didn't see</i>

796
00:54:54.678 --> 00:54:56.888
<i>-Well, who'd have thought</i>
<i>-Well, bless my soul</i>


797
00:54:56.972 --> 00:54:58.765
<i>-Well, who'd have known</i>
<i>-Well, who indeed</i>


798
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:01.559
<i>And who'd have guessed</i>
<i>They'd come together on their own</i>


799
00:55:01.685 --> 00:55:03.895
<i>-It's so peculiar</i>
<i>-We'll wait and see</i>


800
00:55:04.437 --> 00:55:06.106
<i>A few days more</i>

801
00:55:06.231 --> 00:55:09.526
<i>There maybe something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>


802
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.446
You know, perhaps
there's something there


803
00:55:13.571 --> 00:55:15.240
that wasn't there before.

804
00:55:17.909 --> 00:55:21.538
<i>There may be something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>


805
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.248
What's there, Mama?

806
00:55:24.165 --> 00:55:25.458
Shh.

807
00:55:25.542 --> 00:55:27.669
I'll tell you
when you're older.


808
00:55:41.433 --> 00:55:45.729
They start with a handful of notes,
crescendo in a symphony


809
00:55:45.812 --> 00:55:48.315
of imagination and creativity.

810
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:52.819
<i>The sweeping score and songs</i>
<i>of Alan Menken.</i>


811
00:55:52.902 --> 00:55:55.864
<i>The unforgettable lyrics</i>
<i>of Howard Ashman.</i>


812
00:55:57.198 --> 00:56:01.536
<i>Together, they helped lead</i>
<i>a Disney animated musical renaissance</i>


813
00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:05.290
<i>with</i>Beauty and the Beast,
The Little Mermaid, <i>and</i> Aladdin.


814
00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:12.088
<i>While Ashman tragically passed away</i>
<i>before</i>Beauty and the Beast <i>was released,</i>


815
00:56:12.714 --> 00:56:16.718
<i>Menken has kept the spirit</i>
<i>of their partnership alive</i>


816
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:21.473
<i>through his music</i>
<i>for Disney classics and beyond.</i>


817
00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:24.392
<i>Acclaimed as it is beloved,</i>

818
00:56:24.517 --> 00:56:27.103
<i>Menken and Ashman's work</i>
<i>on</i> Beauty and the Beast


819
00:56:27.187 --> 00:56:30.315
<i>did far more than achieve</i>
<i>a Tony nomination,</i>


820
00:56:30.523 --> 00:56:33.026
<i>four Grammys, and two Oscars.</i>

821
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:35.695
The Oscar goes to Alan Menken
and Howard Ashman


822
00:56:35.779 --> 00:56:38.198
for "Beauty and the Beast"
from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>


823
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.244
NARRATOR:<i>It struck a chord in all of us,</i>

824
00:56:43.495 --> 00:56:45.872
<i>inspiring fans of all ages,</i>

825
00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:50.377
<i>including some of the biggest names</i>
<i>in the recording industry.</i>


826
00:56:52.128 --> 00:56:55.215
And just wait until you hear

827
00:56:55.423 --> 00:56:58.134
the wonderful rendition
of "Beauty and the Beast"


828
00:56:58.676 --> 00:56:59.844
that Shania Twain

829
00:56:59.928 --> 00:57:03.014
and eight-time Oscar-winning
composer Alan Menken


830
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.600
have in store.

831
00:57:22.534 --> 00:57:25.578
-Tonight is the night.

832
00:57:26.955 --> 00:57:28.248
I'm not sure I can do this.

833
00:57:28.415 --> 00:57:32.210
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.


834
00:57:32.377 --> 00:57:34.003
Bold. Daring.

835
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:40.969
There will be music,
romantic candlelight,


836
00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:43.138
provided by myself.

837
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:46.683
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.


838
00:57:47.892 --> 00:57:51.813
Yes. I con...I ...
I... no, I can't.


839
00:57:51.938 --> 00:57:53.314
You care for the girl, don't you?

840
00:57:53.481 --> 00:57:55.608
-More than anything.

841
00:57:55.733 --> 00:57:57.318
Well, then you must tell her.

842
00:57:59.529 --> 00:58:03.241
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh, you look so...so...

843
00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:04.659
Stupid.

844
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:09.789
Not quite the word I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.


845
00:58:14.419 --> 00:58:16.588
Your lady awaits.

846
00:58:40.987 --> 00:58:43.907
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

847
00:58:46.201 --> 00:58:49.078
<i>True as it can be</i>

848
00:58:51.414 --> 00:58:53.833
<i>Barely even friends</i>

849
00:58:54.083 --> 00:58:56.419
<i>Then somebody bends</i>

850
00:58:56.628 --> 00:58:59.422
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

851
00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:05.678
<i>Just a little change</i>

852
00:59:06.804 --> 00:59:09.432
<i>Small to say the least</i>

853
00:59:09.516 --> 00:59:14.729
<i>Both a little scared</i>
<i>Neither one prepared</i>


854
00:59:14.812 --> 00:59:17.982
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

855
00:59:20.485 --> 00:59:23.738
<i>Ever just the same</i>

856
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:29.160
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

857
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:35.416
<i>Ever as before</i>
<i>Ever just as sure</i>


858
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:39.170
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

859
00:59:39.963 --> 00:59:42.257
<i>Oh</i>

860
00:59:43.383 --> 00:59:46.636
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

861
00:59:48.054 --> 00:59:50.723
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

862
00:59:53.101 --> 00:59:55.687
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

863
00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.314
<i>Finding you can change</i>

864
00:59:58.398 --> 01:00:02.151
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

865
01:00:03.486 --> 01:00:06.197
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

866
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:10.660
<i>Rising in the east</i>

867
01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:13.079
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

868
01:00:13.288 --> 01:00:16.082
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

869
01:00:16.165 --> 01:00:20.670
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

870
01:00:22.338 --> 01:00:25.758
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

871
01:00:25.925 --> 01:00:29.220
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

872
01:00:31.472 --> 01:00:37.395
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

873
01:00:38.187 --> 01:00:40.523
<i>Off to the cupboard</i>
<i>with you now, Chip.</i>


874
01:00:40.982 --> 01:00:42.317
<i>
-It's past your bedtime.</i>

875
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.152
<i>Mm, mm</i>

876
01:00:44.277 --> 01:00:45.903
<i>Good night, love.</i>

877
01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:08.426
Belle?

878
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.723
Are you happy here with me?

879
01:01:14.265 --> 01:01:15.475
Yes.

880
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.481
What is it?

881
01:01:23.274 --> 01:01:25.360
If only I could see my father again.

882
01:01:25.777 --> 01:01:28.488
Just for a moment.
I miss him so much.


883
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.578
There is a way.

884
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.833
This mirror will show you anything.

885
01:01:41.417 --> 01:01:43.044
Anything you wish to see.

886
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.131
I'd like to see my father, please.

887
01:01:54.138 --> 01:01:56.474
Papa! Oh, no.

888
01:01:57.392 --> 01:01:58.476
He's sick.

889
01:01:58.935 --> 01:02:01.437
He may be dying,
and he's all alone.


890
01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:10.697
Then you... you must go to him.

891
01:02:11.322 --> 01:02:13.825
-What did you say?
-I release you.


892
01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:15.952
You're no longer my prisoner.

893
01:02:16.202 --> 01:02:18.746
You mean... I'm free?

894
01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:20.623
Yes.

895
01:02:21.207 --> 01:02:22.792
Oh, thank you.

896
01:02:23.751 --> 01:02:26.087
Hold on, Papa, 
I'm on my way.

897
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.133
Take it with you

898
01:02:30.591 --> 01:02:34.721
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.


899
01:02:38.975 --> 01:02:41.477
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.


900
01:02:50.403 --> 01:02:51.988
Well, Your Highness,

901
01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:55.199
I must say everything is going
just swimmingly.


902
01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:58.077
I knew you had it in you.

903
01:02:58.327 --> 01:03:00.413
-I let her go.

904
01:03:00.496 --> 01:03:01.581
Yes, yes.

905
01:03:01.914 --> 01:03:04.584
Splen...you what?

906
01:03:05.543 --> 01:03:08.463
-How could you do that?
-I had to.


907
01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:11.799
Yes, but-but-but... but why?

908
01:03:11.966 --> 01:03:15.011
Because I love her.

909
01:03:41.162 --> 01:03:44.874
<i>I was the one who had it all</i>

910
01:03:45.958 --> 01:03:49.670
<i>I was the master of my fate</i>

911
01:03:50.463 --> 01:03:55.259
<i>I never needed anybody in my life</i>

912
01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:59.305
<i>I learned the truth too late</i>

913
01:04:00.264 --> 01:04:03.559
<i>I'll never shake away the pain</i>

914
01:04:04.936 --> 01:04:08.397
<i>I close my eyes but she's still there</i>

915
01:04:09.816 --> 01:04:14.237
<i>I let her steal into my melancholy heart</i>

916
01:04:14.695 --> 01:04:19.700
<i>It's more than I can bear</i>

917
01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:25.373
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

918
01:04:25.832 --> 01:04:30.002
<i>Even as she runs away</i>

919
01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:32.672
<i>She will still torment me</i>

920
01:04:33.005 --> 01:04:39.595
<i>Calm me, hurt me</i>
<i>Move me, come what may</i>


921
01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:43.975
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

922
01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:48.855
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

923
01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:52.608
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

924
01:04:54.819 --> 01:04:58.573
<i>And be with me for evermore</i>

925
01:05:31.814 --> 01:05:35.359
<i>I rage against the trials of love</i>

926
01:05:36.235 --> 01:05:40.156
<i>I curse the fading of the light</i>

927
01:05:40.698 --> 01:05:44.619
<i>Though she's already flown</i>
<i>So far beyond my reach</i>


928
01:05:45.077 --> 01:05:50.708
<i>She's never out of sight</i>

929
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:55.796
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

930
01:05:56.005 --> 01:06:00.092
<i>Even as she fades from view</i>

931
01:06:00.593 --> 01:06:03.554
<i>She will still inspire me</i>

932
01:06:03.638 --> 01:06:09.769
<i>Be a part of everything I do</i>

933
01:06:10.144 --> 01:06:14.482
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

934
01:06:14.774 --> 01:06:19.195
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

935
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.782
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

936
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.162
<i>And as the long, long nights begin</i>

937
01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:32.249
<i>I'll think of all that might have been</i>

938
01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.293
<i>Waiting here</i>

939
01:06:34.502 --> 01:06:41.425
<i>For evermore</i>

940
01:07:05.783 --> 01:07:08.119
What defines the legacy of a story?

941
01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:13.582
Its enduring impact both on
and off the screen for evermore.


942
01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:17.378
<i>Perhaps it's seeing</i>
<i>that story reinvented</i>


943
01:07:17.503 --> 01:07:21.090
<i>just as</i>Beauty and the Beast
<i>was in its ground-breaking,</i>


944
01:07:21.257 --> 01:07:23.926
<i>highly-acclaimed Broadway adaptation.</i>

945
01:07:25.011 --> 01:07:27.888
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>Disney Theatrical Productions</i>


946
01:07:27.972 --> 01:07:30.433
<i>under the direction</i>
<i>of its president and producer,</i>


947
01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:34.228
<i>Thomas Schumacher,</i>
<i>has forged a new chapter</i>


948
01:07:34.478 --> 01:07:37.898
<i>in the legacy</i>
<i>of this classic title,</i>


949
01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:41.068
<i>one that gave audiences</i>
<i>around the world</i>


950
01:07:41.193 --> 01:07:44.864
<i>a chance to fall in love</i>
<i>with these iconic characters</i>


951
01:07:44.947 --> 01:07:49.535
<i>all over again,</i>
<i>from India to Australia</i>


952
01:07:50.369 --> 01:07:52.455
<i>to the warm Footlights</i>
<i>in the West End</i>


953
01:07:52.788 --> 01:07:54.415
<i>and throughout the UK.</i>

954
01:07:56.792 --> 01:08:00.504
<i>Or perhaps the legacy</i>
<i>of this timeless classic</i>


955
01:08:00.588 --> 01:08:03.549
<i>is in witnessing the magical</i>
<i>spark of inspiration</i>


956
01:08:03.632 --> 01:08:06.802
<i>it ignites in artists,</i>
<i>in children</i>


957
01:08:06.969 --> 01:08:09.430
<i>who wish they could be</i>
<i>part of its world,</i>


958
01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:13.434
<i>and in grown-ups</i>
<i>who still dream of the same.</i>


959
01:08:15.311 --> 01:08:17.980
As for where
that legacy will go from here,


960
01:08:19.356 --> 01:08:20.775
only time will tell.

961
01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:24.445
But if you would care to make
a prediction,


962
01:08:24.987 --> 01:08:27.948
please, be our guest.

963
01:08:31.494 --> 01:08:32.411
Hi!

964
01:08:46.509 --> 01:08:48.552
It's all right, Papa.
I'm home.


965
01:08:50.137 --> 01:08:52.890
I thought I'd never see you again.

966
01:08:53.682 --> 01:08:55.184
I missed you so much.

967
01:08:55.434 --> 01:08:57.853
But the Beast... how did you escape?

968
01:08:57.978 --> 01:09:00.731
I didn't escape, Papa.
He...he let me go.


969
01:09:01.148 --> 01:09:04.318
-That horrible Beast?
-But he's different now, Papa.


970
01:09:04.735 --> 01:09:07.071
He's changed somehow.

971
01:09:12.326 --> 01:09:15.496
-Hi!
-Oh, a stowaway.


972
01:09:15.579 --> 01:09:18.624
Why, hello there, little fella.

973
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:21.043
Didn't think I'd see you again.

974
01:09:21.293 --> 01:09:25.673
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore?


975
01:09:26.173 --> 01:09:28.259
Oh, Chip, of course I do.

976
01:09:28.384 --> 01:09:29.593
-It's just that...

977
01:09:32.638 --> 01:09:36.142
-May I help you?
<i>-I've come to collect your father.</i>


978
01:09:36.225 --> 01:09:38.978
<i>-My father?</i>
<i>-Don't worry, mademoiselle.</i>


979
01:09:39.562 --> 01:09:42.481
-We'll take good care of him.

980
01:09:42.565 --> 01:09:46.193
-My father's not crazy.
-He was raving like a lunatic.


981
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.738
-We all heard him, didn't we?

982
01:09:49.905 --> 01:09:51.365
-No!

983
01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:53.075
-I won't let you.
-Belle?


984
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:56.120
Maurice.
Tell us again, old man.


985
01:09:56.412 --> 01:10:00.040
Just how big was the Beast?

986
01:10:00.124 --> 01:10:03.043
He was...I mean, he was...
he was enormous!


987
01:10:03.127 --> 01:10:07.131
I'd say at least 8...
no, more like 10 feet.


988
01:10:09.341 --> 01:10:11.802
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.


989
01:10:13.137 --> 01:10:14.638
It's true, I tell you!

990
01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:17.057
-Get him out of here.

991
01:10:17.141 --> 01:10:18.350
Let go of me!

992
01:10:18.726 --> 01:10:20.769
No! You can't do this.

993
01:10:22.271 --> 01:10:25.399
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.


994
01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:27.276
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

995
01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:32.823
Mm, I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding, if...


996
01:10:33.073 --> 01:10:35.784
-If what?
-If you marry me.


997
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.245
-What?
-One little word, Belle.


998
01:10:38.329 --> 01:10:39.788
That's all it takes.

999
01:10:39.872 --> 01:10:41.415
-Never.
-Have it your way.


1000
01:10:41.582 --> 01:10:43.667
Belle? Hey...

1001
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:45.127
Let go of me.

1002
01:10:45.502 --> 01:10:48.005
My father's not crazy,
and I can prove it.


1003
01:10:48.297 --> 01:10:49.673
Show me the Beast!

1004
01:10:58.265 --> 01:11:00.100
The Beast will make off
with your children.


1005
01:11:00.768 --> 01:11:01.894
He'll come after them
in the night.


1006
01:11:01.977 --> 01:11:03.646
-No!
-Gaston is right!


1007
01:11:04.063 --> 01:11:07.942
Look at its sharp, cruel fangs.
It's threat to us all!


1008
01:11:08.317 --> 01:11:10.986
We're not safe until its head
is mounted on my wall.


1009
01:11:11.403 --> 01:11:14.448
-I say we kill the Beast!
-Yeah!


1010
01:11:14.531 --> 01:11:16.450
No! I won't let you do this.

1011
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.369
The monster must have her
under his spell.


1012
01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:20.537
He'll curse us all
if we don't stop him.


1013
01:11:21.038 --> 01:11:23.082
-Yeah!
-If you're not with us...


1014
01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:25.834
-you're against us!

1015
01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:27.044
Bring the old man.

1016
01:11:27.253 --> 01:11:29.255
Get your hands off me!

1017
01:11:29.588 --> 01:11:32.466
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.


1018
01:11:32.591 --> 01:11:33.884
-Let us out!

1019
01:11:35.344 --> 01:11:38.430
We'll rid the village of this Beast.
Who's with me?


1020
01:11:38.514 --> 01:11:40.516
Yeah!

1021
01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:42.142
<i>Through the mist</i>
<i>Through the woods</i>


1022
01:11:42.226 --> 01:11:43.769
<i>Through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1023
01:11:43.852 --> 01:11:46.814
<i>It's a nightmare</i>
<i>But it's one exciting ride</i>


1024
01:11:46.897 --> 01:11:50.150
<i>Say a prayer then we're there</i>
<i>At the drawbridge of a castle</i>


1025
01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:53.028
<i>And there's something</i>
<i>Truly terrible inside</i>


1026
01:11:53.404 --> 01:11:56.740
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>He's got fangs, razor sharp ones</i>


1027
01:11:56.824 --> 01:11:59.660
<i>Massive paws</i>
<i>Killer claws for the feast</i>


1028
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.038
<i>Hear him roar, see him foam</i>
<i>But we're not coming home</i>


1029
01:12:03.122 --> 01:12:04.832
<i>Till he's dead</i>

1030
01:12:05.082 --> 01:12:06.583
<i>-Good and dead</i>
-Yeah!


1031
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.294
<i>-Kill the beast</i>
<i>-Mount your horse</i>


1032
01:12:08.377 --> 01:12:10.087
<i>Screw your courage</i>
<i>To the sticking place</i>


1033
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:13.048
<i>We're counting on Gaston</i>
<i>To lead the way</i>


1034
01:12:13.215 --> 01:12:16.302
<i>Through the mist, through the wood</i>
<i>Where within a haunted castle</i>


1035
01:12:16.385 --> 01:12:19.430
<i>Something's lurking</i>
<i>That you don't see every day</i>


1036
01:12:19.722 --> 01:12:22.641
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>One as tall as a mountain</i>


1037
01:12:22.975 --> 01:12:26.186
<i>We won't rest till he's good and deceased</i>

1038
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:29.565
<i>Sally forth, tally ho</i>
<i>Grab your sword, grab your bow</i>


1039
01:12:29.648 --> 01:12:31.066
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go</i>

1040
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.860
We'll lay siege to the castle.

1041
01:12:33.068 --> 01:12:35.154
<i>We don't like</i>
<i>What we don't understand</i>


1042
01:12:35.237 --> 01:12:36.447
<i>In fact it scares us</i>

1043
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:39.283
<i>And this monster is mysterious at least</i>

1044
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:42.786
<i>Bring your guns, bring your knives</i>
<i>Save your children and your wives</i>


1045
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.664
<i>We'll save our village and our lives</i>

1046
01:12:45.873 --> 01:12:47.333
<i>We'll kill the beast</i>

1047
01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:49.710
Take whatever booty
you can find.


1048
01:12:49.793 --> 01:12:52.838
But remember,
the Beast is mine!


1049
01:12:52.921 --> 01:12:55.924
<i>Hearts ablaze, banners high</i>
<i>We go marching into battle</i>


1050
01:12:56.008 --> 01:12:59.011
<i>Unafraid although</i>
<i>The danger just increased</i>


1051
01:12:59.219 --> 01:13:02.181
<i>Raise your flag, sing the song</i>
<i>Here we come, we're 50 strong</i>


1052
01:13:02.264 --> 01:13:06.518
<i>And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong</i>
<i>Let's kill the beast</i>


1053
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:29.750
-Now!

1054
01:13:46.975 --> 01:13:49.103
Yes!

1055
01:13:53.732 --> 01:13:54.983
Here we go!

1056
01:13:58.695 --> 01:14:01.073
-What the devil?

1057
01:14:01.156 --> 01:14:02.408
Belle, look out!

1058
01:14:09.164 --> 01:14:11.458
You guys gotta try
this thing.


1059
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:16.713
-Move, move, move, move.

1060
01:14:21.427 --> 01:14:23.137
And stay out.

1061
01:14:25.806 --> 01:14:27.349
Ugh.

1062
01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:54.626
Get up.

1063
01:14:56.879 --> 01:14:58.005
Get up!

1064
01:14:58.547 --> 01:15:01.842
What's the matter, Beast?

1065
01:15:01.925 --> 01:15:04.928
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?


1066
01:15:12.352 --> 01:15:13.770
BELLE:<i>No!</i>

1067
01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:19.735
-Belle...
-No, Gaston, don't!


1068
01:15:25.491 --> 01:15:26.658
Let's go, Philippe.

1069
01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:44.092
Come on out and fight.

1070
01:15:46.178 --> 01:15:49.014
Were you in love with her,
Beast?


1071
01:15:49.097 --> 01:15:51.475
Did you honestly think
she'd want you


1072
01:15:51.642 --> 01:15:53.727
when she had someone like me?

1073
01:16:05.906 --> 01:16:07.741
It's over, Beast.

1074
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:09.868
Belle is mine!

1075
01:16:13.997 --> 01:16:16.959
Let me go. Let me go!

1076
01:16:17.042 --> 01:16:18.377
Please, don't hurt me.

1077
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.254
I'll do anything. Anything!

1078
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:37.104
-Get out.

1079
01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:38.397
Beast!

1080
01:16:39.314 --> 01:16:40.524
Belle?

1081
01:16:49.533 --> 01:16:50.701
Belle.

1082
01:16:56.748 --> 01:16:58.250
You came back.

1083
01:17:22.482 --> 01:17:23.567
Oh.

1084
01:17:37.372 --> 01:17:38.332
You...

1085
01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:43.462
-you came back.
-Of course I came back.


1086
01:17:43.962 --> 01:17:45.172
I couldn't let them...

1087
01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:47.716
Oh, this is all my fault.

1088
01:17:48.175 --> 01:17:50.802
-If only I'd gotten here sooner.
-Maybe...


1089
01:17:52.304 --> 01:17:54.556
it's better... it's better this way.

1090
01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.099
Don't talk like that.

1091
01:17:57.142 --> 01:17:59.519
-You'll be all right.

1092
01:17:59.603 --> 01:18:02.939
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine. You'll see.


1093
01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:05.400
At...

1094
01:18:05.651 --> 01:18:06.777
at least...

1095
01:18:07.819 --> 01:18:09.279
I got to see you

1096
01:18:10.614 --> 01:18:12.074
one last time.

1097
01:18:23.043 --> 01:18:23.919
No.

1098
01:18:24.127 --> 01:18:25.212
No!

1099
01:18:26.129 --> 01:18:28.006
Please, please.

1100
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:30.050
Please, don't leave me.

1101
01:18:33.929 --> 01:18:35.222
I love you.

1102
01:20:54.402 --> 01:20:56.947
Belle. It's me!

1103
01:21:12.838 --> 01:21:14.256
It is you!

1104
01:21:47.372 --> 01:21:50.584
Lumière. Cogsworth!

1105
01:21:51.209 --> 01:21:53.545
Oh! Mrs. Potts!

1106
01:21:53.879 --> 01:21:55.839
-Look at us!

1107
01:21:55.964 --> 01:21:57.549
Mama, mama!

1108
01:22:01.595 --> 01:22:03.763
-Oh, my goodness.

1109
01:22:04.014 --> 01:22:05.724
-It is a miracle!

1110
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:52.687
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1111
01:22:54.648 --> 01:22:59.235
<i>True as it can be</i>

1112
01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.823
<i>Barely even friends</i>

1113
01:23:04.157 --> 01:23:11.122
<i>Then somebody bends unexpectedly</i>

1114
01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:16.294
<i>Just a little change</i>

1115
01:23:16.503 --> 01:23:19.047
<i>Just a little change</i>

1116
01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:22.342
<i>Small to say the least</i>

1117
01:23:22.634 --> 01:23:25.512
<i>Both a little scared</i>

1118
01:23:25.595 --> 01:23:28.348
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

1119
01:23:28.598 --> 01:23:34.771
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1120
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:39.859
<i>Ever just the same</i>

1121
01:23:41.361 --> 01:23:46.866
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

1122
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:50.578
<i>Ever as before</i>

1123
01:23:50.662 --> 01:23:53.498
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

1124
01:23:53.748 --> 01:23:59.004
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

1125
01:24:09.222 --> 01:24:12.392
<i>Oh!</i>

1126
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.503
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1127
01:24:40.587 --> 01:24:43.673
H.E.R.: <i>Certain as the sun</i>

1128
01:24:43.757 --> 01:24:46.968
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1129
01:24:47.052 --> 01:24:50.221
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1130
01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:53.349
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1131
01:24:53.558 --> 01:24:59.939
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1132
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:03.026
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1133
01:25:03.151 --> 01:25:06.279
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1134
01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:10.533
<i>Beauty and</i>

1135
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:17.540
<i>The Beast</i>

1136
01:26:38.705 --> 01:26:41.166
Follow me!

1137
01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.042
Lunch?

1138
01:26:45.295 --> 01:26:46.796
-Okay, one, two, three...
-Wolves.


1139
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.259
Everybody sing along.

1140
01:27:01.019 --> 01:27:01.978
Uh...

1141
01:27:04.022 --> 01:27:07.942
Say hello to Mark Henn,
who actually animated Belle.


1142
01:27:11.112 --> 01:27:13.364
What kind of shenanigans
will happen next?


1143
01:27:16.576 --> 01:27:18.203
The amazing world of Disney.

1144
01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:24.918
Now bounce, now bounce.

1145
01:27:29.088 --> 01:27:31.174
I had the best time,
and I'm sad it's over.
