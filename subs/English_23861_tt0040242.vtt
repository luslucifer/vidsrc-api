1
00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:33.048
Preceding today's American operations...

2
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.293
...heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force
made a night attack...


3
00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:40.557
...on the important
marshaling yard at Hamm.


4
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.763
Of all British operations...

5
00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.568
...only 1 2 of
our aircraft failed to return.

6
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.174
Any questions from the correspondents?

7
00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:56.810
Major Davenport.

8
00:02:58.584 --> 00:03:00.017
Ladies and gentlemen...

9
00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:04.145
...l have only limited news
on today's American air operations.


10
00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:08.453
ln the deepest penetration to date,
strong formations of Flying Fortresses...


11
00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:11.825
...were dispatched well beyond the range
of friendly fighter cover...


12
00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:15.695
...to attack key industrial objectives
in Germany.


13
00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:20.862
An early estimate indicates that upward
of 200 German fighters were destroyed.


14
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.905
Forty-eight of our bombers are missing.

15
00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:24.542
Forty-eight?

16
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.884
That's all at the present time,
ladies and gentlemen.


17
00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:34.144
Let's get out of here.

18
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.915
What do you expect us to write when we
don't even know the name of the target?


19
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.356
Would it be tactless to inquire
what kind of industrial objectives?


20
00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:45.522
''Key industrial objectives.''

21
00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:48.963
A fine comfort for a lot of new widows
back home.


22
00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:51.232
What do you suppose is there, Brockie?

23
00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:54.271
ls there any one target in Germany
worth 48 bombers?


24
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.271
Worth it to whom?

25
00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:57.772
Casey Dennis?

26
00:03:57.944 --> 00:03:59.878
What's 48 bombers?

27
00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:01.104
-Hello, Brockie.
-Hello.


28
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.373
-Hello, Carwood.
-Hi.


29
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:05.742
Good evening, constable.

30
00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.316
Maybe they're after something special.

31
00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:13.288
lf it's that, l'm willing to be shown.
For my money, it's Dennis that's special.


32
00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.450
-Taxi.
-What's the answer, Brockie?


33
00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:17.892
All guts and no brain?

34
00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:20.159
No, that's putting it too simply.

35
00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.996
Dennis is one of those boys
whose brain is fascinated by guts.


36
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.400
He loves this lousy war.

37
00:04:26.572 --> 00:04:27.698
Taxi.

38
00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:30.940
The Savoy. Then King's Cross Station.

39
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.874
lf Dennis throws you in the guardhouse,
we'll bail you out.


40
00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.446
lt's been a long while
since l've talked to the boys.


41
00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:39.813
-Tell the boss l'll phone soon as l get there.
-Right.


42
00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:11.377
Another big one out today?

43
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.417
You ain't kidding.
They're putting everything up that can fly.


44
00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:18.045
Thought the boys might have drawn
a stand-down after yesterday.


45
00:05:18.858 --> 00:05:21.554
-Not with old iron butt driving the wagon.
-Who?


46
00:05:21.727 --> 00:05:23.888
Who do you think? Dennis.

47
00:05:57.863 --> 00:06:00.297
That's the one we seen
come in yesterday, sir.


48
00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:01.899
l don't know who was flying it.

49
00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:04.332
Pilot, dead. Copilot, wounded.

50
00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:07.233
About five of them bailed out.

51
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.775
You better drive around the other side.

52
00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:14.344
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:38.003 --> 00:06:40.870
What do you think this is,
a sheet-metal shop?


54
00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:44.406
The old man wanted to have this
as soon as l'd done it.


55
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.647
Do you think
we're gonna get rest tomorrow?


56
00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:52.580
l don't know. They ain't said yet.
But he can't keep this up.


57
00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:58.213
ln that case, maybe this is the night
l could get that date with Joan.


58
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.619
You know she don't
like to date nobody but me.


59
00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:07.359
Three pounds ten,
and l'll stay home.


60
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.134
How long will you stay home?

61
00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:13.931
You said Â£2.1 0 yesterday.
The price has gone up.


62
00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:16.301
So has the price of whiskey.

63
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.073
Fork over.

64
00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:28.817
Do you usually take her something
or do you just go by yourself?


65
00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:32.355
Well, if l was you,
l'd take her some peanuts.


66
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:34.923
Especially if l was you.

67
00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:39.561
General Dennis' office.

68
00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.929
What? He is? Thanks, Mike.

69
00:07:43.102 --> 00:07:44.467
Beat it.

70
00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:46.963
Hello, Harry.

71
00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:50.472
The tower at the 32nd just called.
The old man's coming in.


72
00:07:50.776 --> 00:07:53.006
Better break it up, you guys,
the old man's back.


73
00:07:54.647 --> 00:07:56.137
Good afternoon, sir.

74
00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:58.044
-Got the signal, Evans?
-Not yet, sir.


75
00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:00.845
The estimated time
over target is 1 2:1 1 .


76
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.148
-Yesterday's strike photo's been plotted?
-Right there, sir.


77
00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:27.935
Good.

78
00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:34.211
Right on it. Good.

79
00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:37.852
-l want a set of these for General Kane.
-Yes, sir.


80
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.757
-Anything else?
-Well, sir...


81
00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:45.328
...in this batch of DFCs
approved by General Kane...


82
00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:48.126
-...there's one for Captain Lucius Jenks.
-Jenks?


83
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.201
Colonel Haley said
you wanted to see his file, sir.


84
00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:54.796
Call the 32nd and tell them
l want Captain Jenks here.


85
00:08:54.974 --> 00:08:56.236
Yes, sir.

86
00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.808
And there was this correspondent,
you know the one--


87
00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:01.412
l have no time.
Tell Public Relations to handle him.


88
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.070
Yes, sir.

89
00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:26.929
-Flying control. That's right.
-l'll call you as soon as l....


90
00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:29.802
-Bring me all reports on enemy opposition.
-Yes, sir.


91
00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:34.708
That's it. Baker-One-Seven,
High Hat, C-Charlie.


92
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.316
Very likely there'll be more.
Aircrew should hardly get their feet wet.


93
00:09:38.484 --> 00:09:41.419
Yes. Thanks, chum.

94
00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.453
-Strike signal?
-Still sweating it out.


95
00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:47.456
RAF Mosquitoes have reported
a formation of U.S. Fortresses...


96
00:09:47.626 --> 00:09:51.289
...under very heavy fighter attack

97
00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:57.432
What's your report
on morale, Haley?


98
00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:00.697
After the last two days,
they're too tired to bother about morale.


99
00:10:00.873 --> 00:10:03.341
How many crews are making
their last mission today?


100
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:06.205
Eleven, if they get back, sir.

101
00:10:06.912 --> 00:10:09.107
Then we lose them anyway.

102
00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:14.380
Ted should have
his bomb-bay doors open right now.


103
00:10:15.754 --> 00:10:17.619
Strike signal from

104
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.124
Primary attacked. Visibility, perfect.
Results, excellent.


105
00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:26.421
Well, that's two out of three.

106
00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:28.567
That leaves just one to go.

107
00:10:28.734 --> 00:10:30.998
-Check that with command.
-Yes, sir.


108
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.596
Davis, any changes
in your 1 400 weather map?


109
00:10:35.074 --> 00:10:38.874
Well, there's an interesting cold mass
forming eccentrically over the Arctic Sea.


110
00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:41.478
Never mind the genealogy.
How will it affect us?


111
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.950
Weather along the coastal fringes
in southern France should be--


112
00:10:45.117 --> 00:10:46.482
l'm not interested in France.

113
00:10:46.652 --> 00:10:49.018
What about central
and northern Germany?


114
00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:50.280
Right here.

115
00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:53.257
Way in there again, sir?
Three days running?


116
00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:56.053
Major, l'm consulting you
about the weather.


117
00:10:56.228 --> 00:10:57.593
Sorry, sir.

118
00:10:57.763 --> 00:11:00.698
lt should be wide open
all the way to Breslau.


119
00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:03.198
Good at our bases all day.

120
00:11:15.414 --> 00:11:16.779
Four-forty.

121
00:11:17.883 --> 00:11:19.316
Five-fifty.

122
00:11:22.888 --> 00:11:25.823
l want all leaves canceled
until we know today's losses.


123
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:27.458
Yes, sir.

124
00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:31.160
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.

125
00:11:33.332 --> 00:11:34.663
Well?

126
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.164
Then are we to understand, sir,
we'll have...


127
00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.804
-...another maximum effort tomorrow?
-That's right.


128
00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:43.107
Keep bringing me that weather
as you get it.


129
00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:52.944
Well, what headaches
have you got, Earnie?


130
00:11:53.118 --> 00:11:55.313
Have you been getting any sleep, Casey?

131
00:11:55.487 --> 00:11:57.478
You're not pretty enough for a nurse.

132
00:11:57.656 --> 00:11:59.214
What have you got?

133
00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:04.361
Well, there's a rather stiff protest here, sir,
from a Robert Hintonbottom.


134
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.330
President of the Middle Counties Association
of Farmers, Dairymen and Poulters.


135
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.435
lt seems these early take-offs
have been frightening the cows...


136
00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:14.231
...around Colonel Foster's base
and drying up the milk.


137
00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:16.533
He also says it's been disturbing
the chickens.


138
00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:18.802
They're not laying like they used to.

139
00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:22.877
Write him a polite letter, tell him
we're trying to lay a few eggs of our own.


140
00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:24.515
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.416
-What is it, Evans?
-Message from General Kane, sir. Secret.


142
00:12:29.588 --> 00:12:30.953
Read it.

143
00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:35.591
''Members Military Affairs Committee
arrived in England.


144
00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:39.060
Your command will be visited.
lmperative their impressions favorable.


145
00:12:39.231 --> 00:12:41.995
Request your special efforts
to maintain low loss average...


146
00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:45.967
...during critical three days next.
Signed, Malloway for Kane.''


147
00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:52.233
All right. Wait a minute.

148
00:12:54.913 --> 00:12:56.005
What else, Earnie?

149
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:59.776
There's this matter of Captain Donford
and Miss Blundy in the village, sir.


150
00:12:59.952 --> 00:13:02.477
-What about it?
-She and her mother are pretty keen...


151
00:13:02.654 --> 00:13:04.417
...that she should marry him.

152
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.683
What about the boy?
Does he wanna marry her?


153
00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:10.295
l don't know, sir, but he's got
one wife already in the States.


154
00:13:10.662 --> 00:13:12.823
ls he combat crew or base personnel?

155
00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:15.990
Navigator. Got 1 0 missions left to go.

156
00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:17.499
Thanks. Do we know the woman?

157
00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:18.897
Oh, l know her, sir.

158
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.739
l beg your pardon, sir.

159
00:13:23.642 --> 00:13:26.270
l'm not surprised. 
Any suggestion?

160
00:13:26.812 --> 00:13:29.645
Excuse me, sir.
Would the general like to square...


161
00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:32.648
...that is, have this matter attended to
by negotiations, sir?


162
00:13:32.818 --> 00:13:34.183
lf it can be done.

163
00:13:34.353 --> 00:13:37.322
l'd have to have an order
for a couple of gallons of ice cream...


164
00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:39.548
...and a few hours off, sir.

165
00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:43.862
Get it and get going.

166
00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:46.455
With the general's permission, sir.

167
00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:49.157
These matters are better attended to
in the evening.


168
00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:52.326
All right.

169
00:13:56.809 --> 00:13:58.299
Anything else?

170
00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:00.809
You and Cliff Garnet were classmates,
weren't you?


171
00:14:00.979 --> 00:14:01.968
Yeah, why?

172
00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:04.012
He's flying over here from Washington.

173
00:14:04.183 --> 00:14:07.016
Due in at Prestwick this afternoon.
Did you know that?


174
00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:10.950
Cliff Garnet.

175
00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:15.560
l've known Cliff ever since we were racing
for a pair of corporal stripes at the Point.


176
00:14:15.727 --> 00:14:18.525
l thought you'd always been
sort of neck and neck.


177
00:14:18.697 --> 00:14:20.426
What's he doing over here?

178
00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:23.261
They haven't announced
an assignment for him.


179
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:28.266
Maybe you're gonna have
a new boss, Earnie.


180
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.034
-A relay from Colonel Martin, sir.
-What's it say?


181
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.340
''Target plastered. Warm up here.
Signed, Ted.''


182
00:14:39.585 --> 00:14:42.076
l'll bet it's pretty warm
in Schweinhafen too.


183
00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:13.476
Get me London, 
Central 1 0,000.

184
00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:15.711
<i>Elmer Brockhurst, 
United News.</i>

185
00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:18.721
Yes, sir.
Everything's under control, sir.


186
00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:22.921
-What are you doing here, Mr. Brockhurst?
-Hello?


187
00:15:23.095 --> 00:15:25.063
Your connections are terrible.

188
00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:27.892
Hello, Maggie. 
Give me Bigelow.

189
00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:32.863
Hello, Jack. Brockhurst.

190
00:15:33.038 --> 00:15:35.438
l'm talking from a seat
right on the 50-yard line...


191
00:15:35.607 --> 00:15:37.507
...but the game hasn't started yet.

192
00:15:38.143 --> 00:15:41.010
Better get ready for the same
run around as yesterday.


193
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.172
Sure, l'll try.

194
00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:45.009
Okay, l'll call you.

195
00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:46.844
Are you the new commanding general?

196
00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:49.783
No, just a poor reporter
trying to do his job.


197
00:15:49.955 --> 00:15:52.788
Poor reporter is right.
l thought Dennis told you to keep out.


198
00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.289
He did.

199
00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:57.155
You guys always get what you want
from Kane, don't you?


200
00:15:57.329 --> 00:16:01.095
Public relations office is down the hall.
The general doesn't wanna see you.


201
00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:04.201
l don't blame you
for feeling jumpy, sergeant.


202
00:16:05.237 --> 00:16:06.568
Quite a deal, isn't it?

203
00:16:08.307 --> 00:16:10.468
Your boss gets put in top charge
for one day...


204
00:16:10.642 --> 00:16:13.702
...and loses more planes
than General Kane ever lost in a week.


205
00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.370
Maybe he just doesn't like airplanes.

206
00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:19.346
Maybe he doesn't like their crews either.

207
00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:20.982
Tell me...

208
00:16:21.153 --> 00:16:23.917
...why has Dennis got
a flight commander with 21 missions...


209
00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:25.818
...confined to quarters at the 32nd?

210
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.459
Probably for not brushing his teeth.

211
00:16:28.827 --> 00:16:31.261
Well, that disposes of the item
of Captain Jenks.


212
00:16:32.264 --> 00:16:34.232
Does that finish your business?

213
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.266
l did want to say goodbye
to General Dennis before he left.


214
00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:38.835
Goodbye? Who's leaving?

215
00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:41.004
Well, trouble with the press...

216
00:16:41.173 --> 00:16:45.542
...war hero under arrest,
record losses just one time too many....


217
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:48.202
l just have the feeling
he might be going home.


218
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.440
They never fired no general
till they give him the Legion of Merit.


219
00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:54.107
They can pass it out mighty quick.

220
00:16:55.087 --> 00:16:56.486
Gonna miss your hero?

221
00:16:56.655 --> 00:16:58.589
No brass is a hero to me.

222
00:16:58.757 --> 00:17:01.021
l've done my 25.

223
00:17:02.194 --> 00:17:04.856
Captain Jenks to see General Dennis.

224
00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:08.957
Captain Jenks reporting, sir.

225
00:17:09.134 --> 00:17:10.897
<i>Have him come in.</i>

226
00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:14.537
Yes, sir. Okay, captain.

227
00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:20.639
Want me with you, sir?

228
00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:23.713
No, l'll talk to the captain alone.
Come in, Jenks.


229
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.410
Sit down.

230
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.720
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks.


231
00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:38.292
l've got a pretty nasty report
on you here.


232
00:17:38.463 --> 00:17:40.488
l understand when the target
was announced...


233
00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:43.759
...you slammed out of the group's briefing,
said you wouldn't fly.


234
00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:46.597
-What's your version of it?
-lt's true, as far as it goes.


235
00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:51.869
Captain Jenks, it's an old custom
in the service to call your superiors sir.


236
00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:55.936
All right, we'll skip the manners
for the moment.


237
00:17:56.481 --> 00:18:00.042
-Do you realize this is serious?
-l won't get killed to make you a record.


238
00:18:00.218 --> 00:18:01.515
Maybe you've had too much.

239
00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:04.154
l guess a few days
down at Bournemouth wouldn't hurt.


240
00:18:04.322 --> 00:18:09.350
lf you look in the bottom of the file, you'll
see l finished 1 0 days in a rest home, sir.


241
00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:15.998
Tell me...

242
00:18:16.168 --> 00:18:19.262
...your uncle's on
the Military Affairs Committee, isn't he?


243
00:18:19.438 --> 00:18:21.770
Would that have anything to do
with your behavior?


244
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.271
Sure it has.

245
00:18:23.442 --> 00:18:25.876
lt's lucky l've got somebody
to look out for me.


246
00:18:26.044 --> 00:18:28.774
How would you like to have
your squadron hear you say that?


247
00:18:28.947 --> 00:18:31.575
-They feel the same way.
-They went this morning.


248
00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:34.115
Don't give me that, general.

249
00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:37.813
My squadron knows that l can take it
as well as anybody, if l want to.


250
00:18:37.989 --> 00:18:39.820
l've been to plenty of tough targets.

251
00:18:43.562 --> 00:18:45.189
Suppose l were to tell you...

252
00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:48.890
...that the whole war might depend
on what we did yesterday and today?


253
00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:51.797
That's what your PRO will tell us.

254
00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:56.871
You and your crew were one
of the lead teams trained for this operation.


255
00:18:57.042 --> 00:18:59.135
They needed you there today.

256
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:03.938
Do you know that we lost two ships from
your group this morning during assembly?


257
00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:05.945
My crew, sir?

258
00:19:10.489 --> 00:19:12.320
Get me Markington.

259
00:19:12.824 --> 00:19:15.349
Hello, Markington? 
Colonel Walker.

260
00:19:15.527 --> 00:19:18.223
Hello, Walker? 
General Dennis speaking.

261
00:19:18.697 --> 00:19:21.131
Who did we lose in that collision
this morning?


262
00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:23.290
Robinson, huh?

263
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:26.194
Yes, l think l did know him.

264
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:28.839
Yes, too bad. He was a good boy.

265
00:19:29.007 --> 00:19:31.601
Who? Johnson?

266
00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.974
Oh, Johnston, huh?

267
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:37.012
No, l don't think l did.

268
00:19:37.182 --> 00:19:39.650
Well, then neither one
was a lead crew.


269
00:19:39.818 --> 00:19:42.013
Okay. Thanks, Walker.

270
00:19:44.689 --> 00:19:46.281
Robinson, huh?

271
00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:47.755
So you knew him?

272
00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:50.019
Did you know whether
Frank was married or not?


273
00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:52.789
Whether he had any kids
or where he came from?


274
00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:56.229
You don't remember Johnston at all.
You don't know what he looked like.


275
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:57.868
-Take it easy.
-Why should you?


276
00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:01.403
He's only got in 20 missions over Germany.
Only been here eight months.


277
00:20:01.573 --> 00:20:05.031
You gave him his cluster on his DFC
after Bremfurt, shook his hand, said:


278
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.146
''The division is proud of you. Proud.''
Why do you try to remember our names?


279
00:20:09.314 --> 00:20:11.646
-Why don't you call us by serial numbers?
-Captain!


280
00:20:11.816 --> 00:20:12.840
Attention.

281
00:20:13.185 --> 00:20:15.119
General Kane and party, sir.

282
00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:17.847
-Hello, Casey.
-Sorry, l wish l'd known you were coming.


283
00:20:18.023 --> 00:20:20.992
That's all right. We landed
at Prestwick a couple of hours ago.


284
00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:22.751
l wanted to stop off and see you.

285
00:20:22.928 --> 00:20:23.917
How was Washington?

286
00:20:24.095 --> 00:20:27.326
About as you'd expect
with that meeting going on.


287
00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:29.023
ls this man with your party?

288
00:20:29.201 --> 00:20:32.102
Why, yes. l bumped
into Brockie right outside your office.


289
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.033
What were you doing,
Mr. Brockhurst?


290
00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:36.606
l know you and Brockie
had a little misunderstanding.


291
00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:38.868
That was one thing
l wanted to straighten out.


292
00:20:39.044 --> 00:20:41.512
-All right, that's all for now.
-Why, Captain Jenks.


293
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.548
Delighted to see you, my boy. l was talking
with your uncle in Washington on Monday.


294
00:20:45.717 --> 00:20:48.379
He's looking forward to seeing you
when he gets over here.


295
00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:51.351
Brockie, this is one
of our real combat leaders.


296
00:20:51.523 --> 00:20:54.151
He's a flight commander
and already has 23 missions.


297
00:20:54.326 --> 00:20:56.453
-lt is 23, isn't it, captain?
-Twenty-one, sir.


298
00:20:56.628 --> 00:20:57.720
Oh, 21 , eh?

299
00:20:57.896 --> 00:21:00.763
Well, l guess that name on your ship
hardly applies anymore.


300
00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:04.265
<i>Captain Jenks is the pilot
of our famous Impatient Virgin.</i>


301
00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:07.633
Say now, there's a crew
you could do a wonderful picture layout on.


302
00:21:07.806 --> 00:21:09.706
-lt's already been done, general.
-Good.


303
00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:12.342
You care to see what l've written
about your squadron?


304
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.909
Thanks.

305
00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:17.239
You better bring it up to date.

306
00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:19.315
McPhearson, here, was killed on Friday.

307
00:21:19.484 --> 00:21:21.611
Jacobs went down yesterday.

308
00:21:21.853 --> 00:21:23.514
All right, captain.

309
00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:33.063
What have you been doing?
l got the shock of my life last night.


310
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:34.425
l was afraid of that.

311
00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:37.432
When we sat down at Gander,
Prescott handed me a message...


312
00:21:37.602 --> 00:21:40.935
...from Washington saying
you'd lost 48 ships yesterday.


313
00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:42.266
That's right, 48.

314
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.069
l'd just finished selling the chiefs
on the low cost of daylight bombardment...


315
00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:49.702
...and you spring these appalling losses
on me. Casey, surely you must re--


316
00:21:52.851 --> 00:21:55.479
That's Cliff Garnet.
He flew over with me.


317
00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:58.953
Apparently, the chief wants him
to look under a few beds.


318
00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:04.521
l'm sorry, Casey. Who should l run into
out there but old Ramrod Haley.


319
00:22:04.696 --> 00:22:07.893
l just told him about the pilot,
the mermaid and the rubber dinghy.


320
00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.795
-How are you?
-Glad to see you, Cliff.


321
00:22:09.968 --> 00:22:12.766
l saw Kathy and those youngsters
of yours day before l left.


322
00:22:12.937 --> 00:22:15.405
-Yeah? How are they?
-Fine, Casey, fine.


323
00:22:15.573 --> 00:22:17.666
Got some letters and packages for you.

324
00:22:17.842 --> 00:22:19.707
-How's Ted?
-Keeping busy.


325
00:22:19.878 --> 00:22:22.278
That's good. Sis gave me
a lot of messages for him.


326
00:22:22.447 --> 00:22:24.915
-How is Helen?
-She's fine. She's staying with mother.


327
00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:26.675
She's expecting it any day now.

328
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:28.751
Have you braced yourself
to be an uncle?


329
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.083
l'm hoping it will be a girl.
One who won't fly anything but a kite.


330
00:22:32.257 --> 00:22:35.522
No, not Ted's daughter.
She'll probably be another Amelia Earhart.


331
00:22:35.694 --> 00:22:37.685
-General, what are you doing here?
-Brockie.


332
00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:40.854
l thought you were sitting
with the mighty in the Pentagon.


333
00:22:41.032 --> 00:22:45.025
l gotta get out once in a while and see how
these boys are fighting the real war.


334
00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:47.933
You're doing a wonderful job, Casey.
All you fellas are.


335
00:22:48.106 --> 00:22:50.074
Have they turned you
into an air inspector?


336
00:22:50.442 --> 00:22:51.966
Well, no.

337
00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:54.941
The chief can't wait to find out
everything through channels.


338
00:22:55.113 --> 00:22:57.604
Call it personal reconnaissance.

339
00:22:59.017 --> 00:23:01.349
General Dennis. Who?

340
00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:03.043
Just a minute, he's right here.

341
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:06.247
-lt's for you, sir, the Duchess of Waverly.
-Oh, thank you.


342
00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:08.619
Hello. Hello, Millie.

343
00:23:08.793 --> 00:23:10.283
Yes, l just arrived.

344
00:23:10.462 --> 00:23:12.657
l tried to get in touch
with you from Prestwick.


345
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:17.859
Oh, l wanted to tell you again
how charming the luncheon was last week.


346
00:23:18.236 --> 00:23:20.966
The results were very evident
in Washington.


347
00:23:22.374 --> 00:23:25.901
Oh, no, it was very useful to meet him
for once in an informal way.


348
00:23:26.778 --> 00:23:29.611
Your luncheons may have done more
for daylight bombardment...


349
00:23:29.781 --> 00:23:32.682
...than all the tonnage
we've dropped since April.


350
00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:35.546
Thank you, my dear.

351
00:23:35.854 --> 00:23:39.346
Thursday? Yes, yes, l think l can.

352
00:23:39.524 --> 00:23:41.082
Some what?

353
00:23:42.093 --> 00:23:43.856
Oh, peanuts.

354
00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:47.992
Certainly. Send them over
with my sergeant this afternoon.


355
00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:50.794
All right, Millie. Goodbye.

356
00:23:52.837 --> 00:23:55.237
Come on now, Brockie,
don't look so gloomy.


357
00:23:55.407 --> 00:23:58.535
l want you and Casey to cut this out.
We're fighting the same war.


358
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.703
l tried to explain to him that nobody wants
to withhold information from the press.


359
00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:05.850
l've seen the way Mr. Brockhurst
handles legitimate information.


360
00:24:06.017 --> 00:24:07.712
-When?
-After Bremfurt.


361
00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:10.582
We needed another attack
to finish that job.


362
00:24:10.755 --> 00:24:14.782
By the time you got through with our losses,
and Washington got through explaining...


363
00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:19.419
...we got an order that it'd be politically
impossible to attack the place again.


364
00:24:19.597 --> 00:24:23.055
Boys are being killed today with cannon
made at Bremfurt since that attack.


365
00:24:23.234 --> 00:24:25.202
-Now wait a minute--
-You think, general...


366
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.431
...that the American public should accept
losses without even knowing the target?


367
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:32.373
Yesterday's communiquÃ©
was pretty skimpy, Casey.


368
00:24:32.544 --> 00:24:34.205
But we've certainly nothing to hide.

369
00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:36.973
Our loss average
is still far below expectations.


370
00:24:37.148 --> 00:24:39.241
-ls today going to help it?
-What do you mean?


371
00:24:39.417 --> 00:24:41.885
Yesterday was a bloody massacre.
Won't today be worse?


372
00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:45.216
-l don't like your language, Mr. Brockhurst.
-l'm sorry, general...


373
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.019
...but even a dumb civilian can tell
you've got a maximum effort out today.


374
00:24:49.194 --> 00:24:50.684
Maximum?

375
00:24:51.129 --> 00:24:52.858
Where did they go today?

376
00:24:56.768 --> 00:24:58.360
This is not a matter
for the press.


377
00:24:58.536 --> 00:25:00.697
Brockie's been a friend
of air power for years.


378
00:25:00.872 --> 00:25:02.737
What's today's target?

379
00:25:04.042 --> 00:25:06.067
Very good, sir. Schweinhafen.

380
00:25:06.244 --> 00:25:09.338
Schweinhafen. And yesterday?

381
00:25:09.514 --> 00:25:11.379
Yesterday's target was Posenleben, sir.

382
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:13.881
Casey, you haven't started--

383
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:22.792
Brockie, l'm afraid there is a question
of security involved here, if you don't mind.


384
00:25:30.368 --> 00:25:33.735
-Have you started Operation Stitch?
-The second phase is on today, sir.


385
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:40.434
l don't want the congressional
committee to come today.


386
00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:42.637
Call London and have
their itinerary changed.


387
00:25:42.814 --> 00:25:45.647
See that they don't get here
before the day after tomorrow.


388
00:25:45.817 --> 00:25:48.809
-And cancel that thing at the embassy.
-Yes, sir.


389
00:25:50.188 --> 00:25:53.282
Get me command headquarters.
This is General Kane.


390
00:25:53.458 --> 00:25:55.358
Get me General Malloway.

391
00:25:55.894 --> 00:25:58.089
Hello, Bob? Oh, pretty good.

392
00:25:58.263 --> 00:25:59.855
Let's scramble.

393
00:26:00.398 --> 00:26:01.592
Ready?

394
00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:03.427
No, l'm at Dennis' headquarters.

395
00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:06.832
l want a complete security blackout
on today's operations.


396
00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:09.906
Nothing to be passed on to London
without my personal approval.


397
00:26:10.074 --> 00:26:12.736
Under no circumstances
will any field order be sent out...


398
00:26:12.911 --> 00:26:15.175
...unless you hear from me personally.

399
00:26:15.346 --> 00:26:18.713
That's right.
l'm resuming command as of now.


400
00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:20.350
All right, Bob.

401
00:26:22.287 --> 00:26:25.347
Casey, this may pull down
the work of 20 years.


402
00:26:25.523 --> 00:26:27.423
All right, let's have it.

403
00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:30.755
After you left, weather
conference gave us a clear break...


404
00:26:30.929 --> 00:26:33.329
...over central and northeast Germany
for four days.


405
00:26:33.498 --> 00:26:35.022
There was a chance to do the job.

406
00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:37.963
Possibly the last one,
so l laid on Stitch.


407
00:26:38.636 --> 00:26:41.469
Regardless that you might be
upsetting the larger picture.


408
00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.932
Larger than what, sir?
The outcome of the war?


409
00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:48.909
The outcome will depend on how large
an air force the combined chiefs allocate us.


410
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.048
-lsn't that correct?
-lt is, sir. You see--


411
00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:52.739
You took advantage of my absence.

412
00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:55.750
You know it wasn't my intention
to implement Stitch this soon.


413
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.888
lt was my decision to make, sir.
l made it.


414
00:26:58.056 --> 00:26:59.956
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

415
00:27:00.124 --> 00:27:04.288
May an ignorant visitor inquire
just what Operation Stitch is all about?


416
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:08.028
You must know something about this
new German fighter, Lantze-Wolf 1 .


417
00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:10.827
You mean that miracle jet job
they're supposed to have?


418
00:27:11.002 --> 00:27:13.732
-ls that it?
-That's it.


419
00:27:15.673 --> 00:27:19.131
-l want to run that special film for Garnet.
-Oh, yes, sir.


420
00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:22.540
Six weeks ago, a German plane
like that model...


421
00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:25.114
...landed on the number one strip
at Ted's field.


422
00:27:25.283 --> 00:27:27.308
-Shot up?
-Not a scratch.


423
00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:31.285
The pilot was a Czechoslovakian engineer.
He'd been forced to work for the Nazis.


424
00:27:31.456 --> 00:27:35.153
When they sent him to the Baltic
to test this job, he flew it here instead.


425
00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:36.657
Sweet of him.

426
00:27:37.128 --> 00:27:39.119
Here are the tests.

427
00:27:41.733 --> 00:27:45.931
Our Lightning, Thunderbolt,
Mustang, Spit 1 2.


428
00:27:46.104 --> 00:27:48.732
And this is the Lantze
-Wolf 1 .

429
00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:52.342
Speed, altitude,
almost double of anything we've got.


430
00:27:52.677 --> 00:27:54.076
lt's a terrific improvement.

431
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:57.043
lmprovement? lt's a revolution, Cliff.

432
00:27:57.215 --> 00:27:59.012
-You ready, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.


433
00:27:59.183 --> 00:28:01.276
Gentlemen, sit down.

434
00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:29.541
lf GÃ¶ring can put
enough of these into the air...


435
00:28:29.714 --> 00:28:32.376
-...he can knock us out in 60 days.
-That's an assumption.


436
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.245
l'm sorry, sir,
but it's a cold fact.


437
00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:37.877
These Lantzes will turn every type of plane
we have into a sitting duck.


438
00:28:38.356 --> 00:28:41.985
l don't have to tell you once they get
control of the air over the continent...


439
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.594
...a ground invasion
will be a pipe dream.


440
00:28:47.265 --> 00:28:50.996
lt was fighters that kept them out of Britain.
Fighters and their own indecision.


441
00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:07.574
We thought these were
just drawing-board figures.


442
00:29:07.885 --> 00:29:10.752
Casey, where are they
making these kites?


443
00:29:18.563 --> 00:29:22.556
We know now that there are three factories
in Germany actually producing these planes.


444
00:29:22.734 --> 00:29:25.567
That is, there were
until yesterday anyway.


445
00:29:25.737 --> 00:29:29.264
Posenleben, Schweinhafen, Fendelhorst.

446
00:29:29.741 --> 00:29:32.232
There it is, Cliff, 
Operation Stitch...

447
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.503
...for ''stitch in time.''

448
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.580
General Kane, why hasn't more of this
been reported to Washington?


449
00:29:40.752 --> 00:29:42.947
l couldn't endorse
such alarming conclusions.


450
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:45.248
Not at the very time
when everything depends...


451
00:29:45.423 --> 00:29:48.119
...on our getting established
on an acceptable loss basis.


452
00:29:48.292 --> 00:29:51.284
Casey, why didn't you wait
at least until the meeting was over?


453
00:29:51.462 --> 00:29:53.862
We would have lost our weather,
which is everything.


454
00:29:54.031 --> 00:29:55.896
To you and me, maybe,
but not to topside.


455
00:29:56.067 --> 00:29:58.592
A third day like this
might kill precision bombardment.


456
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.136
l'm not at all sure
l'm justified in permitting it.


457
00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:03.296
Sir, if we don't finish the job now...

458
00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:07.205
...the men and the planes we've lost so far
will have been lost for nothing.


459
00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:15.410
Here they come.

460
00:30:50.721 --> 00:30:56.387
Six, eight, nine. How many
did the 329th put up this morning?


461
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:58.051
Thirty-six, l think it was, sir.

462
00:30:58.229 --> 00:30:59.321
Nine...

463
00:30:59.497 --> 00:31:00.828
...ten...

464
00:31:00.998 --> 00:31:02.522
...eleven.

465
00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:05.495
-l make it eleven.
-So do l.


466
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.865
How many do you have in a squadron?

467
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:10.439
Twelve, if it was a squadron.

468
00:31:12.443 --> 00:31:14.673
That isn't the remains of a group
is it, Casey?


469
00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:18.373
-l can't tell yet.
-Well, find out. Find out at once.


470
00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:36.899
Boy, this really is a mess.

471
00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:40.327
Better be a story on this, general...

472
00:31:40.504 --> 00:31:44.372
...or it'll look like a cover-up
for the worst blunder since Pearl Harbor.


473
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.541
That was a whole group, sir.

474
00:31:54.719 --> 00:31:58.587
Eleven out of 36.
That's almost 70 percent.


475
00:31:58.756 --> 00:32:00.121
Colonel Martin just called in.

476
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:02.316
Eight miles southeast of the base.

477
00:32:02.493 --> 00:32:04.927
He sent three ships ahead
for emergency landings.


478
00:32:05.096 --> 00:32:08.588
-Are they going to land here?
-Yes, sir. That's two of them now.


479
00:32:10.835 --> 00:32:11.927
Where's the third one?

480
00:32:12.103 --> 00:32:13.365
Still sweating it out.

481
00:32:13.638 --> 00:32:15.765
A bombardier is supposed
to be flying that one.


482
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.875
-A bombardier?
-Yes, sir. Pilot and copilot both hurt.


483
00:32:19.043 --> 00:32:21.841
He's probably a washed-out flying cadet.

484
00:32:22.013 --> 00:32:24.140
That first one's
got his number four feathered.


485
00:32:24.315 --> 00:32:25.441
<i>Hello, Nut Tree.</i>

486
00:32:25.616 --> 00:32:27.709
<i>This is Kumquat B-Baker,
Kumquat B-Baker.</i>


487
00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:31.446
<i>Two miles southeast of field.
Landing instructions, please.</i>


488
00:32:31.622 --> 00:32:37.151
Kumquat B-Baker, land runway two-four.
Wind variable, 1 0 miles.


489
00:32:37.328 --> 00:32:38.420
Have you wounded aboard?

490
00:32:38.596 --> 00:32:40.427
<i>Nut Tree, this is Kumquat B
-Baker.</i>

491
00:32:40.598 --> 00:32:42.998
<i>Two wounded aboard.
Have ambulance stand by.</i>


492
00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:44.964
Roger, Kumquat B
-Baker.

493
00:32:48.973 --> 00:32:53.603
<i>Hello, Nut Tree, this is Jellybean M-Mike
following Kumquat B-Baker in.</i>


494
00:32:53.778 --> 00:32:57.009
<i>Have ambulance stand by.
Wounded aboard.</i>


495
00:32:57.181 --> 00:32:59.672
Roger, Jellybean M
-Mike.

496
00:33:21.706 --> 00:33:25.938
<i>Hello, Nut Tree,
this is Lazy Dog L-Love coming over field.</i>


497
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.206
<i>Bombardier Lieutenant Nelson flying.
Pilot wounded and copilot dead.</i>


498
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:32.144
<i>What'll I do? Over.</i>

499
00:33:32.683 --> 00:33:36.016
Hello, Nelson. Nut Tree to Nelson,
how much gas have you got?


500
00:33:36.787 --> 00:33:41.850
<i>I think she's about empty.
Gas gauge reads dry. What'll I do?</i>


501
00:33:42.026 --> 00:33:44.324
Roger. Stand by.

502
00:33:55.506 --> 00:33:58.634
-He's putting his wheels down.
-Don't let that boy try to land...


503
00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:01.073
-...with the whole group coming in.
-Yes, sir.


504
00:34:03.114 --> 00:34:05.639
Hello, Nelson. 
Get 1 000 feet.

505
00:34:05.816 --> 00:34:08.080
Have crew bail out and head for Wash.

506
00:34:08.586 --> 00:34:12.044
When headed toward water,
bail out yourself.


507
00:34:12.223 --> 00:34:14.214
<i>Having rest of crew bail out.</i>

508
00:34:23.034 --> 00:34:24.797
<i>Landing instructions, please.</i>

509
00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:27.096
Nelson, you are not to land.

510
00:34:27.271 --> 00:34:29.671
Repeat. You are not to land.

511
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.775
Continue to Wash as advised.

512
00:34:34.078 --> 00:34:36.342
<i>Sorry, Nut Tree, 
I can't bail out.</i>

513
00:34:36.514 --> 00:34:40.917
<i>My pilot is alive but cannot be moved.
He cannot use his hands.</i>


514
00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:44.646
<i>-Give me landing instructions, please.
-Let me talk to him.</i>


515
00:34:48.325 --> 00:34:49.815
Hello, Nelson.

516
00:34:49.994 --> 00:34:51.461
Are you receiving me?

517
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:53.358
<i>I am receiving you.</i>

518
00:34:53.531 --> 00:34:56.329
Have you ever landed a 1 7 before?

519
00:34:57.034 --> 00:34:58.365
<i>Not quite.</i>

520
00:34:58.536 --> 00:35:00.595
<i>-Not alone.
-Hello, Nut Tree.</i>


521
00:35:00.771 --> 00:35:02.295
<i>This is Bluebird Red Leader.</i>

522
00:35:02.473 --> 00:35:06.671
<i>Red Leader calling Nut Tree.
Turning on final. Go ahead.</i>


523
00:35:06.844 --> 00:35:08.072
That's Ted Martin.

524
00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:14.909
Roger, Red Leader.
Use runway two-four.


525
00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:17.179
Wind, 1 0, variable.

526
00:35:17.354 --> 00:35:21.154
Watch out for B-1 7
making emergency landing on one-seven.


527
00:35:21.325 --> 00:35:23.190
<i>Roger, Nut Tree.</i>

528
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.851
Will he send the group around
until this boy gets out?


529
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.966
-He can't. They haven't any gas left either.
-Hello, Nelson. Hello, Nelson.


530
00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:38.965
Now, listen carefully.
You may land on runway one-seven.


531
00:35:39.143 --> 00:35:42.203
Do not use runway two-four.

532
00:35:42.546 --> 00:35:43.774
<i>Roger.</i>

533
00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:47.406
There'll be a little crosswind.
Do you think you can make it?


534
00:35:47.785 --> 00:35:48.774
<i>I'll try.</i>

535
00:35:49.487 --> 00:35:50.920
You'll make it.

536
00:35:52.022 --> 00:35:53.614
Now, start letting down a little.

537
00:35:57.928 --> 00:35:59.259
That's it.

538
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.628
Keep your air speed at 1 40
until you know you can make it.


539
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:06.131
Can you see the runway all right?

540
00:36:07.071 --> 00:36:08.732
<i>I see it.</i>

541
00:36:09.206 --> 00:36:13.006
Start your turn over that farmhouse,
so that you'll have a long approach.


542
00:36:17.648 --> 00:36:20.242
That's it. Easy.

543
00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:23.784
Not too steep. 
Not too steep, boy.

544
00:36:28.459 --> 00:36:29.756
That looks good.

545
00:36:30.594 --> 00:36:34.052
When you're over the end of the runway,
don't forget to cut your switches.


546
00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:35.862
Do you know where they are?

547
00:36:36.033 --> 00:36:38.194
<i>-I think so, sir.
-Don't talk now.</i>


548
00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:40.837
That red bar
just in front of your throttles.


549
00:36:41.305 --> 00:36:42.772
See it?

550
00:36:44.808 --> 00:36:47.174
You seem to be lined up all right.

551
00:36:47.344 --> 00:36:50.939
Now, reduce your air speed to 1 20.

552
00:36:51.115 --> 00:36:53.743
Bring the stick back a little.

553
00:36:54.285 --> 00:36:56.185
Not too much.

554
00:36:56.353 --> 00:36:57.513
That's it.

555
00:36:58.522 --> 00:37:02.754
Point it at the end of the runway.
l'll tell you when to level out.


556
00:37:03.494 --> 00:37:05.052
Now, put your flaps down.

557
00:37:06.363 --> 00:37:08.558
No, no, not your landing gear.

558
00:37:08.732 --> 00:37:11.496
The switch right next to it, the flaps.

559
00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:14.263
<i>-Flaps coming down--
-Don't bother answering me now.</i>


560
00:37:14.438 --> 00:37:15.871
Keep your eyes on the runway.

561
00:37:18.943 --> 00:37:20.376
You're doing fine.

562
00:37:24.014 --> 00:37:25.914
Let her down.

563
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:28.142
Easy.

564
00:37:28.586 --> 00:37:32.579
Okay. Now, start back on the stick.

565
00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:45.624
Keep her straight.

566
00:37:52.243 --> 00:37:53.972
Good boy.

567
00:37:54.678 --> 00:37:56.578
Keep that stick full back.

568
00:37:56.747 --> 00:37:57.975
Stay off the brakes.

569
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:01.907
Stay off those breaks!

570
00:38:31.181 --> 00:38:33.376
That's Ted's ship there now.

571
00:38:41.759 --> 00:38:44.489
-That Nelson a new boy?
-No, sir.


572
00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:47.688
He's one of our original
squadron bombardiers.


573
00:39:06.684 --> 00:39:09.448
-Glad to see you back, Colonel Martin.
-Glad to be back.


574
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.020
-Where's the old man?
-He's sweating you out inside.


575
00:39:12.189 --> 00:39:14.123
He's got a crowd
of big wheels with him.


576
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:17.818
-What big wheels?
-General Kane and General Garnet, sir.


577
00:39:19.897 --> 00:39:22.525
Never mind. l'll get
rid of them for you.

578
00:39:34.144 --> 00:39:36.544
All right, that way.
The second interrogation table.


579
00:39:36.714 --> 00:39:40.309
The crew's all set up and waiting.
Photographers are ready when you are, sir.


580
00:39:40.484 --> 00:39:42.577
-Photographers?
-What photographers, sergeant?


581
00:39:42.753 --> 00:39:46.348
-Division and group public relations.
-By whose authority? Who ordered them?


582
00:39:46.523 --> 00:39:49.219
Generals always have their pictures taken
wherever they go.


583
00:39:49.393 --> 00:39:50.724
lt helps the boys' morale.

584
00:39:50.894 --> 00:39:53.055
Well, well, if it helps morale....

585
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.494
Cliff, sit in on one
of these interrogations.


586
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:58.931
Come on, Brockie.
We'll be in here, Casey, when Ted comes.


587
00:39:59.103 --> 00:40:00.536
Whose idea was that?

588
00:40:00.704 --> 00:40:04.299
Sir, we never would have gotten
rid of them without photographers.


589
00:40:04.475 --> 00:40:08.639
Someday you're gonna wisecrack yourself
right into the infantry, sergeant.


590
00:40:12.282 --> 00:40:14.045
What are you looking so grim about?

591
00:40:14.218 --> 00:40:15.685
Ted.

592
00:40:16.153 --> 00:40:18.849
-What's been keeping you? You all right?
-Not a scratch.


593
00:40:19.022 --> 00:40:20.717
What's that blood?

594
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:22.381
My radioman.

595
00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:24.026
-Bad?
-Dead.


596
00:40:24.194 --> 00:40:26.628
-Anybody else?
-Not in our plane.


597
00:40:26.797 --> 00:40:29.994
-As soon as you find that, bring it over.
-Yes, sir.


598
00:40:30.167 --> 00:40:32.135
Hello, Goldberg.
When are you gonna retire?


599
00:40:32.302 --> 00:40:34.793
l guess l should have retired yesterday.

600
00:40:34.972 --> 00:40:36.200
Let's get a drink.

601
00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:38.034
Evans, bring a couple of rations.

602
00:40:38.208 --> 00:40:39.539
-We'll be in there.
-Yes, sir.


603
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.974
Make it three.
Tell them you're taking Hamilton's.


604
00:40:42.146 --> 00:40:44.171
He doesn't drink.
l bought his on the way in.


605
00:40:44.348 --> 00:40:46.873
-l'm glad you got back today.
-So am l.


606
00:40:49.153 --> 00:40:52.088
Sorry, sir, l brought four by mistake.

607
00:40:52.456 --> 00:40:55.482
-Glad to see you back, Colonel Martin.
-Thanks.


608
00:41:04.468 --> 00:41:07.801
l hear Kane and that dashing
brother-in-law of mine are here.


609
00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:12.200
Yeah. The place is full of generals today.

610
00:41:12.509 --> 00:41:14.534
Did Cliff bring any news from Helen?

611
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:17.908
Well, you're not a father yet.
Cliff says she looks wonderful.


612
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:21.073
-l've been keeping an eye out for a cable.
-Thanks.


613
00:41:24.321 --> 00:41:26.016
What's Cliff doing so far from home?

614
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.987
Well, he intimated...

615
00:41:28.158 --> 00:41:31.650
...just routine rubbernecking,
high-level courier stuff.


616
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:33.592
lntimated?

617
00:41:35.532 --> 00:41:37.796
Well, the handle
doesn't stick out anyway.


618
00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:40.368
Colonel, you're speaking
of your revered relative...


619
00:41:40.537 --> 00:41:42.801
...and a general officer
in the U.S. Air Force.


620
00:41:42.973 --> 00:41:46.465
Any brigadier in the Air Force would give
his next star for your job, Casey.


621
00:41:46.643 --> 00:41:50.010
Well, as soon as we finish Stitch,
they can have it for corporal stripes.


622
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.149
Thank heavens we're two-thirds finished.

623
00:41:55.619 --> 00:41:57.086
What's wrong?

624
00:41:57.254 --> 00:41:59.119
That's the joker, Casey.

625
00:41:59.289 --> 00:42:01.757
We aren't two-thirds finished.

626
00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:03.285
We aren't what?

627
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.985
You did Posenleben yesterday
and Schweinhafen today.


628
00:42:06.163 --> 00:42:08.791
We didn't touch Schweinhafen today.

629
00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:11.065
What?

630
00:42:11.835 --> 00:42:13.700
You signaled me.

631
00:42:14.738 --> 00:42:16.433
Mistake.

632
00:42:16.773 --> 00:42:21.642
We plastered some darn place that looked
like it, some 20 miles from Schweinhafen.


633
00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:37.850
-How'd it happen?
-Sighting mistake.


634
00:42:38.495 --> 00:42:40.588
lt was my fault, Casey.

635
00:42:40.764 --> 00:42:44.165
Just as we started the bomb run,
the second group turned inside at the lP.


636
00:42:44.334 --> 00:42:46.427
We had to swing wide
to get out of their way.


637
00:42:46.603 --> 00:42:49.094
Goldberg had only a minute
for identification.


638
00:42:49.273 --> 00:42:52.834
There sat a town that looked more like
Schweinhafen than Schweinhafen does.


639
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.272
Checkpoints were identical.

640
00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:57.072
We were both fooled
by that dummy camouflage...


641
00:42:57.247 --> 00:42:59.545
...and threw our whole load
down the chimney.


642
00:42:59.716 --> 00:43:02.116
The others salvoed into our smoke.

643
00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:10.556
How do you know
it wasn't Schweinhafen?


644
00:43:10.727 --> 00:43:13.890
After we turned north, on our way back,
we saw the real target.


645
00:43:14.064 --> 00:43:17.056
There was Schweinhafen
without a scratch.


646
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:23.103
Generals Kane and Garnet had to go
to the phone. A call from Washington.


647
00:43:23.273 --> 00:43:25.366
They'll meet you
and Colonel Martin at dinner.


648
00:43:25.542 --> 00:43:26.907
Thank you.

649
00:43:37.854 --> 00:43:40.982
l guess Evans should have snitched
another one of these.


650
00:43:44.127 --> 00:43:46.095
Okay, Goldberg.

651
00:43:46.263 --> 00:43:48.663
Keep checking if you
have to pull out every picture.


652
00:43:48.832 --> 00:43:50.891
l'll be at the general's quarters.

653
00:43:51.635 --> 00:43:54.763
He's still looking through
the target photos. No luck yet.


654
00:43:54.972 --> 00:43:58.169
l'd like to know what we did hit
before Kane gets here.


655
00:43:58.909 --> 00:44:00.638
Casey, you look tired.

656
00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:04.178
lf you don't take care of yourself,
someone else will be doing this work.


657
00:44:04.348 --> 00:44:06.145
Maybe today'll give us both a rest.

658
00:44:06.316 --> 00:44:08.113
What's it gonna do to Stitch?

659
00:44:08.285 --> 00:44:09.479
Set us back one day.

660
00:44:10.087 --> 00:44:12.612
We'll hit Schweinhafen tomorrow
and Fendelhorst Monday.


661
00:44:12.789 --> 00:44:14.381
-The weather will hold.
-Will Kane?


662
00:44:14.558 --> 00:44:16.958
-He'll have to.
-He had cold feet before we started.


663
00:44:17.127 --> 00:44:20.426
Tell him about today's snafu
and he'll kill Stitch for good.


664
00:44:21.064 --> 00:44:22.053
What do you suggest?

665
00:44:22.232 --> 00:44:24.257
Don't let him know, tonight anyway.

666
00:44:24.434 --> 00:44:28.336
l'll guarantee you Kane won't be able
to tell today's photos from Schweinhafen.


667
00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:30.907
When are you going to learn
about the Army?


668
00:44:31.074 --> 00:44:33.201
We're not stunt flyers at the state fair.

669
00:44:34.277 --> 00:44:35.301
Oh, good evening.

670
00:44:35.479 --> 00:44:37.538
We can be grateful
for one thing at least.


671
00:44:37.714 --> 00:44:41.445
From what the boys tell me, this seems
to be the finest job of bombing ever done.


672
00:44:41.618 --> 00:44:43.711
What a price though, 52 ships.

673
00:44:43.887 --> 00:44:45.411
-Ted, how are you?
-Still kicking.


674
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:46.886
-Glad to see you.
-Thank you.


675
00:44:47.057 --> 00:44:48.285
Sorry you had a rough day.

676
00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:51.222
But when you're leading,
we never worry about the target.


677
00:44:51.395 --> 00:44:55.331
Soon as they're through, you'll be glad
to know the family's still interested in you.


678
00:44:55.499 --> 00:44:57.763
-How is she?
-Sir, l'd like to speak to you alone.


679
00:44:57.934 --> 00:45:00.596
As soon as Cliff tells you
about our talk with Washington.


680
00:45:00.771 --> 00:45:02.568
-Dinner is served, sir.
-Come on, Cliff.


681
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:03.728
Where's Brockie?

682
00:45:03.907 --> 00:45:06.034
Stayed over to finish
his Schweinhafen stories.


683
00:45:06.209 --> 00:45:10.043
l made him realize this wasn't the fiasco
he thought. He seemed rather impressed.


684
00:45:10.213 --> 00:45:12.078
l think he'll give
us a very good story.

685
00:45:12.249 --> 00:45:14.308
lt's important
that l have a minute with you.


686
00:45:14.484 --> 00:45:17.920
Wait, Casey, l want Cliff to....
Cliff, tell him, will you?


687
00:45:18.622 --> 00:45:20.283
Well, Casey...

688
00:45:20.557 --> 00:45:22.388
...you may think l ratted on you...

689
00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:25.323
...but l felt that our people ought to know
what's going on.


690
00:45:25.495 --> 00:45:28.430
While on the phone with Washington,
l persuaded General Kane...


691
00:45:28.598 --> 00:45:32.193
-...to let me talk to the Air Board.
-What did they say?


692
00:45:32.369 --> 00:45:35.429
Unfortunately, most of them are in Florida
at the proving grounds.


693
00:45:35.605 --> 00:45:37.334
Testing a new typewriter?

694
00:45:37.507 --> 00:45:40.237
Casey, l can't tolerate this attitude.

695
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.243
Our public relations policies
got us where we are today.


696
00:45:43.413 --> 00:45:44.402
lt sure has.

697
00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:48.210
The chief wasn't there, but l had
a very constructive talk with Lester Blender.


698
00:45:48.385 --> 00:45:50.080
And what did Lester ''
Yes, sir'' say?

699
00:45:50.253 --> 00:45:53.518
He was shocked at your losses,
but since you are two-thirds done...


700
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.591
...l think l sold him on letting you
finish Operation Stitch...


701
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.251
...after the Washington meetings
are over.


702
00:45:59.429 --> 00:46:02.762
Sir, did you let
that little two-stars stooge forbid us--?


703
00:46:02.933 --> 00:46:05.868
Casey, if you'll play ball now,
all will be fine after Tuesday.


704
00:46:06.036 --> 00:46:07.230
lncluding the weather?

705
00:46:07.704 --> 00:46:09.831
l found where it was, sir.

706
00:46:13.143 --> 00:46:14.838
Excuse me, sir.

707
00:46:15.011 --> 00:46:18.674
-You said when l found them--
-That's right. Come in, Goldberg.


708
00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:22.717
General Kane, today's lead bombardier,
Lieutenant Goldberg.


709
00:46:22.886 --> 00:46:25.650
Lieutenant, the chief will be proud
of your mission today.


710
00:46:25.822 --> 00:46:26.948
Thank you, sir.

711
00:46:27.124 --> 00:46:30.287
-Oh, colonel, here are the photos.
-Thanks, Gold--


712
00:46:35.766 --> 00:46:38.462
Let's get these under
a stronger light, huh?


713
00:46:51.782 --> 00:46:53.272
Wonderful.

714
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.281
That's what l call precision bombing.

715
00:46:55.452 --> 00:46:56.476
Look, Cliff, look.

716
00:46:56.653 --> 00:47:00.214
Here's the highway coming in here,
here's the river, and here's the factory.


717
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.915
You've got them upside down, sir.

718
00:47:05.195 --> 00:47:07.595
Sir, if you and l
can excuse ourselves for a minute--


719
00:47:07.764 --> 00:47:10.426
Be right with you, Casey.
Look at that destruction, Cliff.


720
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.625
These will go to Washington
by special plane.


721
00:47:12.803 --> 00:47:15.203
Sir, l'd like to frame these
on a good white board...


722
00:47:15.372 --> 00:47:17.966
...with a title,
''The Doom of Schweinhafen.''


723
00:47:18.141 --> 00:47:20.803
lt isn't Schweinhafen, sir.

724
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.908
That's right, sir.

725
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:27.049
That's what l was trying to tell you.

726
00:47:27.217 --> 00:47:28.650
lt isn't Schweinhafen.

727
00:47:29.186 --> 00:47:31.313
Not Schweinhafen? 
What is it then?

728
00:47:31.488 --> 00:47:34.616
lt's the Nautilus torpedo factory
at Gritzenheim, sir.


729
00:47:34.791 --> 00:47:36.349
Torpedo factory?

730
00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:38.323
General, this is very opportune.

731
00:47:38.495 --> 00:47:40.190
Half the united chiefs are admirals.

732
00:47:40.363 --> 00:47:42.490
lf we can get these
to the allocation meeting--


733
00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:43.826
l'll send my own plane.

734
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.831
You don't know what you've done for us.

735
00:47:46.002 --> 00:47:48.835
Showing them that in the midst
of the greatest air campaign...


736
00:47:49.005 --> 00:47:52.463
...we still think enough of the larger aspect
to knock out a torpedo factory too.


737
00:47:52.642 --> 00:47:54.906
l'm sorry, sir. lt wasn't ''too.''

738
00:47:55.078 --> 00:47:57.103
lt was ''instead.''

739
00:48:02.719 --> 00:48:04.584
lnstead?

740
00:48:04.754 --> 00:48:07.222
You let me tell Washington
you destroyed Schweinhafen.


741
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.620
-Brockie's writing a story.
-lt was a mistake.


742
00:48:09.793 --> 00:48:11.090
We hit this Nautilus place.

743
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:13.525
-Whose mistake?
-Mine, sir. The briefing.


744
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:16.922
The briefing was perfect.
l lead the division, l loused it up.


745
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.000
These gentlemen
are covering for me, sir.


746
00:48:19.169 --> 00:48:21.569
l was well-briefed,
and l was on the bombsight.


747
00:48:21.738 --> 00:48:24.332
-l got mixed up in the fighting.
-Why'd you get mixed up?


748
00:48:24.507 --> 00:48:26.634
-Were you scared?
-Yes, sir, l'm always scared.


749
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.506
What do you mean entrusting
a mission of this importance...


750
00:48:29.679 --> 00:48:32.079
-...to a man who admits--?
-l should like to explain.


751
00:48:32.249 --> 00:48:34.274
Sir, General Kane doesn't understand.

752
00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:37.579
Do you understand
what l'd be justified in doing?


753
00:48:37.754 --> 00:48:41.918
You ought to shoot me for wasting

754
00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.890
l'd be grateful if you did.

755
00:48:52.135 --> 00:48:54.933
Sir, Lieutenant Goldberg
is on the fourth mission...


756
00:48:55.105 --> 00:48:58.472
...of a voluntary second tour of duty
over German targets only.


757
00:48:58.642 --> 00:49:00.542
He isn't my group bombardier
by accident.


758
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:03.235
He knows there's a German order
waiting for him.


759
00:49:03.413 --> 00:49:05.643
He knew it when he volunteered
for a second tour.


760
00:49:05.815 --> 00:49:09.012
Today, he hit what we both thought
was the target perfectly.


761
00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:12.484
l've just written him up for a cluster
on his Silver Star.


762
00:49:17.227 --> 00:49:19.661
Send the citation to me personally.

763
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:21.524
Thank you, sir.

764
00:49:26.803 --> 00:49:28.532
General Dennis.

765
00:49:29.439 --> 00:49:30.997
Wait a minute.

766
00:49:31.207 --> 00:49:34.108
My group commanders are standing by
for tomorrow's orders, sir.


767
00:49:34.277 --> 00:49:36.643
l should like to give them their target.

768
00:49:38.214 --> 00:49:40.182
Casey...

769
00:49:40.917 --> 00:49:42.714
...yesterday, we lost 48.

770
00:49:42.886 --> 00:49:44.444
Today, 52.

771
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:47.954
You must be crazy to think l'm going
to rush into a third day like this.


772
00:49:48.124 --> 00:49:50.922
We've got to think this thing over
from every possible angle.


773
00:49:51.094 --> 00:49:52.994
Tell them to wait.

774
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.864
You'll have to wait a bit longer.

775
00:50:00.303 --> 00:50:03.101
l know it is,
but there's nothing we can do.


776
00:50:03.273 --> 00:50:05.639
Tell all groups to stand by.

777
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.747
No.

778
00:50:23.193 --> 00:50:24.524
No target yet, huh?

779
00:50:24.694 --> 00:50:27.754
They're probably only
on their first brandy over there.


780
00:50:28.465 --> 00:50:31.298
Well, brandy or no brandy....

781
00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:33.068
General Dennis' quarters.

782
00:50:38.975 --> 00:50:41.500
General Dennis.
Hold on a minute, George.


783
00:50:41.945 --> 00:50:44.345
General, they're still sweating out
tomorrow's order.


784
00:50:44.514 --> 00:50:45.811
Tell them you'll call back.

785
00:50:45.982 --> 00:50:49.008
May l at least order an alert
for a possible maximum effort, sir?


786
00:50:49.185 --> 00:50:52.677
lf you're willing to put the strain
on your people, probably for nothing.


787
00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:55.651
Tell all groups to be ready
for a maximum effort tomorrow.


788
00:50:55.825 --> 00:50:58.055
Cut the tape for phase two,
Operation Stitch.


789
00:50:58.228 --> 00:51:01.493
That's right. Phase two, Schweinhafen.

790
00:51:02.332 --> 00:51:05.927
And hold it. Don't send it out
until you get further orders.


791
00:51:07.771 --> 00:51:09.762
Why does everything
have to happen at once?


792
00:51:09.939 --> 00:51:14.035
We go to Schweinhafen where we had
no business going, and then we don't hit it.


793
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.735
We wait for good weather all year,
and we get it now...


794
00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:19.245
...just when this committee's
on top of us.


795
00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:23.113
lf my own wife were to walk in here now,
l wouldn't be surprised.


796
00:51:23.286 --> 00:51:25.413
-What is it now?
-Mr. Brockhurst is outside.


797
00:51:25.588 --> 00:51:26.816
No, not now. We're up to--

798
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.788
-May l come in?
-You are in, Mr. Brockhurst.


799
00:51:29.959 --> 00:51:32.723
We're rather occupied for the moment.
What can l do for you?


800
00:51:32.896 --> 00:51:34.124
Straighten me out a little.

801
00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:38.032
l was pretty interested in what you told me
about that Schweinhafen place.


802
00:51:38.201 --> 00:51:40.897
But now the boys over at the 32nd
have me confused.


803
00:51:41.071 --> 00:51:43.835
-lt seems they--
-There's been a mistake. We just found out.


804
00:51:44.007 --> 00:51:47.773
Yes, l know. The Nautilus torpedo factory
at Gritzenheim.


805
00:51:47.944 --> 00:51:49.468
But Homer tells me it's okay.

806
00:51:49.846 --> 00:51:52.076
That this Gritzenheim plant
is just as important.


807
00:51:52.248 --> 00:51:54.842
Naturally, some targets
are more important than others...


808
00:51:55.018 --> 00:51:59.478
...but a blow like this against Germany's
submarine campaign can affect the war.


809
00:51:59.656 --> 00:52:03.251
Any more than an attack with fighter cover
on the sub pens across the Channel?


810
00:52:03.426 --> 00:52:04.757
Now, don't misunderstand me--

811
00:52:04.928 --> 00:52:08.261
ln view of the fact that
we didn't hit our planned target today...


812
00:52:08.431 --> 00:52:11.764
...the Gritzenheim torpedo factory
was considerably better than nothing.


813
00:52:11.935 --> 00:52:13.368
Does that answer your question?

814
00:52:13.536 --> 00:52:15.834
-You can do us a tremendous service.
-What is it?


815
00:52:16.005 --> 00:52:17.996
-Sit down and write this story.
-What story?


816
00:52:18.174 --> 00:52:20.870
From the standpoint of interservice
cooperation alone...


817
00:52:21.044 --> 00:52:23.444
...the importance of naval targets
is beyond dispute.


818
00:52:23.613 --> 00:52:25.137
-Take Gritzenheim--
-May l, sir?


819
00:52:25.315 --> 00:52:28.148
-Yes, go ahead, Homer.
-How about this caption, Brockie?


820
00:52:28.318 --> 00:52:30.616
''The eagle's answer
to the U-boat wolf packs.


821
00:52:30.787 --> 00:52:33.517
Doom of an Axis torpedo factory.''

822
00:52:35.024 --> 00:52:37.390
Well, that's the rough idea anyway.

823
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:41.155
And then with two more days on naval
targets, we can average down losses.


824
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:44.095
Put the Navy under obligation to us,
right at the meetings.


825
00:52:44.267 --> 00:52:47.168
-Right.
-And that washes up Operation Stitch.


826
00:52:47.737 --> 00:52:49.705
Operation what?

827
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:53.632
Oh, that's a special project,
Mr. Brockhurst.


828
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.700
l'm sorry, gentlemen.

829
00:52:55.879 --> 00:52:59.440
l'm afraid l knew beforehand you were
gonna give me the runaround.


830
00:52:59.616 --> 00:53:02.983
l may as well tell you now,
l'll write this story straight or not at all.


831
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.716
The loss of a thousand boys
is still quite a news item back home.


832
00:53:08.424 --> 00:53:10.221
Wait, Brockie.

833
00:53:11.127 --> 00:53:13.994
You know l've always trusted you.
l'm going to trust you now.


834
00:53:14.164 --> 00:53:16.064
Remember what l told you
off the record...


835
00:53:16.232 --> 00:53:19.133
...about the possibility
of enemy secret weapons in the future?


836
00:53:19.302 --> 00:53:21.896
Casey, let me have
that memorandum on Stitch.


837
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:31.510
Here. Go in there and read this,
then forget what you've read.


838
00:53:36.486 --> 00:53:38.920
-Major Lansing's outside, sir.
-Who?


839
00:53:39.088 --> 00:53:41.215
My intelligence officer.
You wanted to see him.


840
00:53:41.391 --> 00:53:44.224
-You say this fella's pretty good.
-He's honest and has sense.


841
00:53:44.394 --> 00:53:45.986
-What is he, a synthetic?
-Retread.


842
00:53:46.162 --> 00:53:48.562
Artilleryman in the last war,
insurance broker since.


843
00:53:48.731 --> 00:53:50.096
Probably a good husband too.

844
00:53:50.266 --> 00:53:52.359
-Have him come in.
-Yes, sir.


845
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.470
Shall l put the
chicken back in the oven?

846
00:53:55.638 --> 00:53:59.199
Oh, let's not bother about that now.
We'll be out of here in a few minutes.


847
00:53:59.375 --> 00:54:01.434
That's fine, sir.

848
00:54:04.781 --> 00:54:07.181
-Do you want me, sir?
-Come in, Lansing.


849
00:54:07.817 --> 00:54:09.842
General Kane, my A2, 
Major Lansing.

850
00:54:10.019 --> 00:54:11.111
Good evening, sir.

851
00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:15.053
Major, do you think the Germans will be
able to put on as tough a show tomorrow...


852
00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:17.785
-...as they did today?
-They will if we go into Germany.


853
00:54:17.961 --> 00:54:20.623
But how can they? We've claimed
over 1 80 enemy fighters...


854
00:54:20.797 --> 00:54:22.560
-...in the last two days.
-We've claimed that.


855
00:54:22.732 --> 00:54:24.256
-You don't believe them?
-No, sir.


856
00:54:24.434 --> 00:54:27.562
-Then why do you report them?
-Orders from your headquarters, sir.


857
00:54:28.371 --> 00:54:31.829
Well, you understand that's necessary
for the boys' morale.


858
00:54:32.008 --> 00:54:34.806
Do you think the German command
knows what Stitch is about?


859
00:54:34.978 --> 00:54:37.640
-lt's my personal opinion that they don't, sir.
-Why?


860
00:54:37.814 --> 00:54:40.408
The Germans don't like to give
their superiors bad news.


861
00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:42.175
How can they help reporting that?

862
00:54:42.352 --> 00:54:44.547
Their information goes up
through channels too.


863
00:54:44.988 --> 00:54:47.115
-ls that a sarcasm, major?
-lt's a fact, sir.


864
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.623
The German radio just announced
they destroyed 1 60 of our bombers today.


865
00:54:50.793 --> 00:54:52.590
Doubtless for the German boys' morale.

866
00:54:52.762 --> 00:54:55.959
You evidently don't think
their high command likes to face the truth.


867
00:54:56.132 --> 00:54:59.067
Well, my observation
is most professional soldiers think more...


868
00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:01.567
...about their political problems
than the enemy.


869
00:55:02.005 --> 00:55:05.736
So when war comes, they ask amateurs
like me what to do with their weapons.


870
00:55:05.908 --> 00:55:08.240
When the results are bad,
they fire the amateurs...


871
00:55:08.411 --> 00:55:10.402
...and make the commanders field marshals.

872
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.481
-We don't have field marshals.
-l'm speaking about the Germans.


873
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:16.710
What will their reaction be if we go back
to Schweinhafen tomorrow?


874
00:55:16.886 --> 00:55:18.547
They'll have to face the truth, sir.

875
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:21.747
And concentrate every fighter they have
in defense of Fendelhorst?


876
00:55:21.924 --> 00:55:23.915
We'd have to expect that, sir.

877
00:55:24.093 --> 00:55:26.027
That's what l think, major.

878
00:55:26.195 --> 00:55:28.595
-l'd like to ask you a personal question.
-Yes, sir.


879
00:55:28.765 --> 00:55:30.096
Facing the facts ourselves...

880
00:55:30.266 --> 00:55:32.894
...do you think it's sound
to continue Stitch right now?


881
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:36.527
lf you wish to continue
precision bombardment, sir.


882
00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:39.941
You mean you think it's feasible?

883
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:42.339
l think it's imperative.

884
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.509
Thank you, major.

885
00:55:55.491 --> 00:55:57.550
Mighty independent major
you keep, Casey.


886
00:55:57.727 --> 00:56:00.321
Of course, he's really only a civilian.

887
00:56:00.697 --> 00:56:02.289
''Precision bombardment imperative.''

888
00:56:02.465 --> 00:56:06.026
The man's not even checked out on
a Piper Cub, he tells me what's imperative.


889
00:56:06.202 --> 00:56:08.170
-He's right, sir.
-l've spent 20 years...


890
00:56:08.338 --> 00:56:10.238
...working for bombardment.
The chief, 25.


891
00:56:10.406 --> 00:56:12.237
-You kids don't know how we fought.
-No?


892
00:56:12.408 --> 00:56:15.206
No. You're giving your youth.
We've already given ours.


893
00:56:15.378 --> 00:56:19.007
l was 1 2 years a captain. 
The chief, 1 4.

894
00:56:19.182 --> 00:56:21.810
We took Billy Mitchell's side
when it meant Siberia...


895
00:56:21.984 --> 00:56:24.009
...and they sent us to a cavalry school.

896
00:56:24.187 --> 00:56:26.553
l was the second-best pilot in America...

897
00:56:26.723 --> 00:56:29.658
...and they assigned me
to keeping records of manure disposal.


898
00:56:29.826 --> 00:56:32.351
But we never gave up,
we never quit trying.


899
00:56:32.528 --> 00:56:34.325
We wrote anything we could get printed.

900
00:56:34.497 --> 00:56:36.965
We went down on our knees
to Hollywood for pictures...


901
00:56:37.133 --> 00:56:41.229
...and we risked our necks every day
to get publicity to educate the public.


902
00:56:41.404 --> 00:56:43.838
And we kept our own funds
for the widows.


903
00:56:44.006 --> 00:56:46.031
We tested without parachutes.

904
00:56:46.209 --> 00:56:49.838
We flew the mail through solid glue
in obsolete training ships.


905
00:56:50.012 --> 00:56:52.947
And the year Hermann GÃ¶ring
dominated the Munich Conference...


906
00:56:53.116 --> 00:56:58.053
...our appropriation still wasn't as big
as the New York City public-safety budget.


907
00:56:58.221 --> 00:57:01.349
-Why didn't you tell the story?
-You don't tell stories in uniform.


908
00:57:01.524 --> 00:57:03.151
We were promised 50,000 planes...

909
00:57:03.326 --> 00:57:06.159
...and our boys were never
gonna fight again in a foreign war.


910
00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:08.320
So the country went back to sleep...

911
00:57:08.498 --> 00:57:12.696
...and we were called from the stables
to make a modern air force out of promises.


912
00:57:12.869 --> 00:57:14.200
They told us the experience--

913
00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:17.032
There was no experience
in daylight precision bombardment.


914
00:57:17.206 --> 00:57:20.403
Both the Germans and British tried it
and said it couldn't be done...


915
00:57:20.576 --> 00:57:22.009
...but the chief said it could.

916
00:57:22.178 --> 00:57:26.114
And we'd just begun to get the tools to get
started, when we were in it ourselves...


917
00:57:26.282 --> 00:57:29.615
...with a double war
and a 50,000-plane paper air force...


918
00:57:29.786 --> 00:57:32.380
...that didn't add up
to 50 serviceable bombers.


919
00:57:32.555 --> 00:57:36.616
Casey, if we'd had in 1 941 ,
the planes you've lost this week...


920
00:57:36.793 --> 00:57:39.660
...we'd have had a Munich with the Japs
that would of made Hitler's...


921
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:42.764
-...look like lnternational Rotary.
-We've fought all our lives.


922
00:57:42.932 --> 00:57:44.763
Now we've got to protect
our beginnings.


923
00:57:44.934 --> 00:57:47.402
-From what?
-From Lantze-Wolf 1 . Tomorrow's air power.


924
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.539
They're just our acknowledged enemies.
They fight us in the open.


925
00:57:50.706 --> 00:57:54.039
Do you remember the fight we had
to get the first experimental Fortress?


926
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:57.611
Do you realize how much the Navy
wants our planes for sub patrol...


927
00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.682
...and to protect the repairing of those
battleships that air power couldn't hurt?


928
00:58:01.851 --> 00:58:05.048
Do you know how much the Army wants
our pilots for company commanders?


929
00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:09.157
Don't you know the British want us
to switch to night area bombardment?


930
00:58:09.325 --> 00:58:14.285
And do you know there's a plan to fly
infantry supplies into China with bombers?


931
00:58:14.464 --> 00:58:18.730
Don't you realize the fight it's taken for Cliff
and the others to get us any planes at all?


932
00:58:18.901 --> 00:58:20.630
-He's right, Ted.
-And every one...


933
00:58:20.803 --> 00:58:23.636
...every one of those factions
is at that meeting right now...


934
00:58:23.806 --> 00:58:27.469
...with its own pet plan for winning
this war. By naval blockade...


935
00:58:27.643 --> 00:58:31.238
...or attrition by defensive,
or a good, sound saber charge.


936
00:58:31.414 --> 00:58:33.882
And you want me to send
the chief back with nothing...


937
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:37.247
-...but three days of prohibitive losses?
-We demolished Posenleben.


938
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.447
And with time and planes and support,
we'll do the same to every factory in Europe.


939
00:58:41.624 --> 00:58:43.649
But the basic decision is at stake now.

940
00:58:43.826 --> 00:58:45.817
You can worry about Germany,
and you should.


941
00:58:45.995 --> 00:58:48.327
But l'm fighting the ground forces,
and the Navy...


942
00:58:48.498 --> 00:58:52.264
...and the Congress, and White House,
and the people in the press, and our allies.


943
00:58:52.435 --> 00:58:55.802
Where did l ever get the idea
that this war was against the Axis?


944
00:58:56.138 --> 00:58:59.630
You think l don't know
the names the boys call me?


945
00:58:59.942 --> 00:59:02.467
Do you think l've enjoyed
spreading this mug of mine...


946
00:59:02.645 --> 00:59:05.079
...around the press
like an eloping heiress?


947
00:59:05.248 --> 00:59:09.412
Do you think l don't know what they can
do to me for the statistics l've juggled...


948
00:59:09.585 --> 00:59:13.919
...the strike photos l've doctored,
the reports l've gilded and suppressed?


949
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.321
l know, and l'd do it all again.

950
00:59:17.493 --> 00:59:19.518
Oh, sit down.

951
00:59:22.965 --> 00:59:26.162
Jack Forbes, Pete Baker...

952
00:59:26.335 --> 00:59:29.930
...burned up in those DH coffins
they made us fly.


953
00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:35.066
Gene Devlin, trying to prove
we could fly bombs into Alaska.


954
00:59:35.344 --> 00:59:39.610
Judby, Glenson, Torrieli,
in that air-mail mess.


955
00:59:39.882 --> 00:59:41.782
Remember how they
got rid of Hugh Enley...


956
00:59:41.951 --> 00:59:45.717
...because he had the guts to stand up
before Congress and tell the truth?


957
00:59:45.888 --> 00:59:50.951
l've spent 20 years, 20 years
watching my friends killed and broken...


958
00:59:51.127 --> 00:59:55.393
...and disgraced and discarded
for one single idea.


959
00:59:55.765 --> 00:59:58.427
To get our country air power.

960
01:00:16.886 --> 01:00:18.183
General Dennis.

961
01:00:18.354 --> 01:00:20.117
Hello, Davis.

962
01:00:20.756 --> 01:00:22.917
Never mind the genealogy.

963
01:00:23.626 --> 01:00:25.594
Day after tomorrow, huh?

964
01:00:26.095 --> 01:00:28.586
Okay, call me as you get it.

965
01:00:30.099 --> 01:00:31.828
There goes our season's weather, sir.

966
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:34.834
We make it these two days
or bite our nails off to the elbows.


967
01:00:35.004 --> 01:00:38.997
Casey, l appreciate toughness and
independence in my subordinates. l like it.


968
01:00:39.175 --> 01:00:40.972
But l'm not thinking about the weather.

969
01:00:41.143 --> 01:00:43.611
l'm thinking about
our whole future, yours too.


970
01:00:43.779 --> 01:00:46.873
And l can't have you
fighting me along with the others.


971
01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:50.280
Woody, if l have to fight you
in order to fight the Germans...


972
01:00:50.453 --> 01:00:53.013
-...you don't leave me any choice.
-That's preposterous.


973
01:00:53.189 --> 01:00:56.716
ls it? Doesn't Washington understand
what's going on here?


974
01:00:56.892 --> 01:01:00.384
You think the Germans would fight
if they weren't scared of our bombardment?


975
01:01:00.563 --> 01:01:02.497
The RAF at night,
and we in the daytime...


976
01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:05.691
...are the only force able to hit
the Germans in Germany.


977
01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:08.735
We're doing what no one in this war
has done so far, Cliff.


978
01:01:08.904 --> 01:01:11.737
We're making the German air force
fight on our initiative...


979
01:01:11.907 --> 01:01:13.772
...and we're tearing it up over Germany.

980
01:01:13.943 --> 01:01:14.932
Make a note of that.

981
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:17.909
German air force has been
the balance of power since Munich.


982
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.105
lt took the German army
everywhere it's been.


983
01:01:20.282 --> 01:01:24.116
lt beat the Polish air force in three days,
and the Norwegian in three hours.


984
01:01:24.286 --> 01:01:26.982
lt forced the Maginot Line,
beat the French in three weeks.


985
01:01:27.156 --> 01:01:28.145
Homer, get this.

986
01:01:28.324 --> 01:01:30.884
The RAF did win a brilliant battle
from it over England.


987
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.552
But it was a defensive battle, the kind
we're making the Germans fight now.


988
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.755
After that, the Germans
were good enough...


989
01:01:36.932 --> 01:01:39.264
...to knock off Yugoslavia
and Greece for practice.


990
01:01:39.435 --> 01:01:41.665
To capture Crete
and dominate the Mediterranean.


991
01:01:41.837 --> 01:01:44.237
To chase the Russians
back to Moscow and Stalingrad.


992
01:01:44.407 --> 01:01:48.275
To blockade the North Cape and very nearly
cut the Atlantic lifeline to England.


993
01:01:48.444 --> 01:01:49.877
They would have done it too...

994
01:01:50.046 --> 01:01:52.640
...if their high command
backed them up with more planes.


995
01:01:52.815 --> 01:01:56.148
We've made them switch from bomber
production to manufacturing fighters.


996
01:01:56.318 --> 01:01:59.651
We've made them pull whole groups
off the Russians and away from Rommel.


997
01:01:59.822 --> 01:02:01.983
And put them across the channel,
facing us.


998
01:02:02.191 --> 01:02:05.251
Our people in the Mediterranean
are advancing under aerial supremacy.


999
01:02:05.428 --> 01:02:06.486
Get every word of this.

1000
01:02:06.662 --> 01:02:10.621
Well, get this too, Homer.
The Germans know this better than we do.


1001
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.360
But they're retreating
from their costliest conquests...


1002
01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:17.131
...and they've broken the balance
of their whole air force for just one thing:


1003
01:02:17.306 --> 01:02:21.333
They're developing jets to make Europe as
impregnable as the Spitfire's made England.


1004
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:22.841
They're going to do it too...

1005
01:02:23.012 --> 01:02:26.413
...just as sure as we sit here
with our fingers in our mouths and let them.


1006
01:02:26.582 --> 01:02:28.777
-Do you want that in too, sir?
-No, not exactly.


1007
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:32.114
Casey, l agree with you entirely,
but we've got to wait.


1008
01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:34.586
Sir, wars are lost by waiting.

1009
01:02:34.757 --> 01:02:36.054
The Allies waited at Munich.

1010
01:02:36.225 --> 01:02:38.693
The French and British
waited behind the Maginot Line.


1011
01:02:38.861 --> 01:02:40.522
The Germans waited
to invade England.


1012
01:02:40.696 --> 01:02:43.824
The Russians waited until they
had to fight without an Allied army.


1013
01:02:43.999 --> 01:02:46.467
We waited for a little more strength
to face Japan.


1014
01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:48.330
Now we're forcing the fighting.

1015
01:02:48.504 --> 01:02:50.597
But if we wait for the cycle
to swing again...


1016
01:02:50.773 --> 01:02:53.207
...we'll wait for the Germans
to put a roof on the continent...


1017
01:02:53.409 --> 01:02:54.876
...to neutralize the Russians...

1018
01:02:55.044 --> 01:02:57.512
...then to face our armies
on D-Day at the Channel...


1019
01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.114
...with an air force
that's already whipped us.


1020
01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:02.614
l'm not saying Operation Stitch
will win the war...


1021
01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:08.382
...but no battle anywhere in this war
has been won without aerial supremacy.


1022
01:03:08.557 --> 01:03:10.582
You say you're thinking of our future?

1023
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.854
Operation Stitch is the price of that.

1024
01:03:19.702 --> 01:03:22.569
Will you gentlemen
wait in the dining room, please?


1025
01:03:23.506 --> 01:03:24.632
You mean me too, sir?

1026
01:03:24.807 --> 01:03:28.106
Yes, l want to talk
to General Dennis alone.


1027
01:03:33.249 --> 01:03:36.116
General, l wish l'd known about this
the day before yesterday.


1028
01:03:36.285 --> 01:03:38.446
l'd like to have
helped you all l could.

1029
01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:40.782
That's all right, Mr. Brockhurst.

1030
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:51.193
Casey, you must think me
incapable of decision.


1031
01:03:51.367 --> 01:03:53.460
Sir, l know that you have many things...

1032
01:03:53.636 --> 01:03:56.070
...on your level to cope with
that l don't have here.


1033
01:03:56.238 --> 01:03:59.765
But if Washington screams for blood,
l'll have to throw you to the wolves.


1034
01:03:59.942 --> 01:04:01.000
l understand, sir.

1035
01:04:01.177 --> 01:04:04.305
And if l have to jettison you,
we lose our best brigadier.


1036
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.414
Thank you, sir,
but we're all expendable.


1037
01:04:06.582 --> 01:04:11.110
And if they have to jettison me,
we'll probably lose daylight bombardment.


1038
01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:14.188
When they sent us here to command,
they expected us to command.


1039
01:04:14.356 --> 01:04:15.846
l hope so, Casey...

1040
01:04:16.025 --> 01:04:20.086
...because l'm releasing the division
to your discretion with immediate effect.


1041
01:04:21.197 --> 01:04:22.289
Thank you, sir.

1042
01:04:22.464 --> 01:04:24.955
You're fully aware
of what may happen?


1043
01:04:25.134 --> 01:04:26.931
Perfectly, sir.

1044
01:04:27.536 --> 01:04:29.470
Well, l hope it doesn't.

1045
01:04:31.407 --> 01:04:33.170
Good luck, my boy.

1046
01:04:45.654 --> 01:04:47.519
-Green light?
-Yeah.


1047
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:50.523
-George, get me Major Rockton.
-How did it happen?


1048
01:04:50.693 --> 01:04:52.354
There's been some slip-up.

1049
01:04:52.528 --> 01:04:55.088
The sergeant of the guard just called.
They'll be here.


1050
01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:59.098
Find out who disobeyed my orders. This is
one slip-up that's not going to get by.


1051
01:04:59.268 --> 01:05:00.496
Just a minute, George.

1052
01:05:01.637 --> 01:05:03.161
This really upsets the applecart.

1053
01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:07.435
You heard me order that committee
be kept away until day after tomorrow?


1054
01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:09.339
They're here,
and they're coming over.


1055
01:05:09.511 --> 01:05:11.479
Have you got the tape
for Operation Stitch?


1056
01:05:11.647 --> 01:05:13.342
-Well, put up--
-What are you doing?


1057
01:05:13.515 --> 01:05:14.880
Ordering tomorrow's operation.

1058
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:17.143
-This changes everything.
-One moment, George.


1059
01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:19.719
The impressions of this committee
mean life or death.


1060
01:05:19.889 --> 01:05:23.552
l'm not going to have them watching
the sort of thing we saw this afternoon.


1061
01:05:23.726 --> 01:05:25.523
Sir, we can't keep the groups waiting.

1062
01:05:25.694 --> 01:05:28.720
l'm sorry, we'll have to pick
the safest naval target we can find.


1063
01:05:28.898 --> 01:05:32.561
-Sir, you--
-No more argument, Casey. That's an order.


1064
01:05:36.105 --> 01:05:39.268
Never mind, George. l'll call you back.

1065
01:05:42.945 --> 01:05:46.608
Can you give these congressmen
a decent dinner?


1066
01:05:47.216 --> 01:05:48.706
l hope so, sir.

1067
01:05:48.884 --> 01:05:51.546
lf Evans hasn't commandeered
that chicken.


1068
01:05:54.713 --> 01:05:57.807
And l know he is,
and l don't mind saying that after hearing...


1069
01:05:57.983 --> 01:06:00.747
...what American boys
went through this afternoon...


1070
01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:06.915
...l feel that what l said to the president
in 1 940 still stands, in my humble opinion.


1071
01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:09.253
But hold on, Arthur.

1072
01:06:09.594 --> 01:06:12.995
Well, sergeant, that looks mighty good.

1073
01:06:13.398 --> 01:06:15.923
Never listen to ltalian thieves....

1074
01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:18.968
l said, ''Mr. President, this is my....''

1075
01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.404
Give me the VlP quarters.

1076
01:06:27.512 --> 01:06:29.980
ls this the officer in charge
of visitors' quarters?


1077
01:06:30.148 --> 01:06:32.139
This is Major Prescott,
General Kane's aide.


1078
01:06:32.317 --> 01:06:34.114
Are those rooms ready?

1079
01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:35.947
Clean sheets in all of them?

1080
01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:39.420
Good. Be sure you have
a coal fire in each room.


1081
01:06:39.591 --> 01:06:41.183
Now, it's pretty cold.

1082
01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:43.589
Have you any hot-water bottles?

1083
01:06:44.362 --> 01:06:46.193
How would l like to what?

1084
01:06:46.364 --> 01:06:48.889
Oh, very funny.

1085
01:06:49.334 --> 01:06:51.325
''l contend you remind me of someone'' ...

1086
01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:55.302
...l told the president
before this whole thing started.


1087
01:06:57.075 --> 01:07:00.476
Well, we doughboys
had our songs too, you know.


1088
01:07:07.185 --> 01:07:09.380
Oh, no. No.

1089
01:07:12.457 --> 01:07:15.688
Well, Clifton,
do you find travel broadening?


1090
01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:19.262
You can't walk out of there like this, Ted.
You're almost as bad as Casey.


1091
01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:20.762
Were you sent to replace him?

1092
01:07:20.932 --> 01:07:22.957
-l don't think so.
-What does Kane think?


1093
01:07:23.135 --> 01:07:26.627
He asked me confidentially
if l'd been sent here to replace him.


1094
01:07:26.805 --> 01:07:30.707
Please, you haven't done anything bad
enough to be a major general, have you?


1095
01:07:30.876 --> 01:07:33.242
Same old rebel, huh, Ted?

1096
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:36.710
Listen, old man,
Helen's worried about you flying missions.


1097
01:07:36.882 --> 01:07:39.146
What does she want me to do?
Transfer to infantry?


1098
01:07:39.317 --> 01:07:41.444
You can do so much more
with your experience.


1099
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.780
What?

1100
01:07:42.954 --> 01:07:45.445
l've been fighting for bombardment
in my own way.


1101
01:07:45.624 --> 01:07:49.321
l think the combined chiefs are gonna
give me a B-29 command in the Pacific...


1102
01:07:49.494 --> 01:07:53.055
-...to make me prove what l've been saying.
-A B-29 command?


1103
01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:56.064
-Do you realize what that means?
-Well, it means another star.


1104
01:07:56.234 --> 01:07:57.223
Star.

1105
01:07:57.402 --> 01:08:01.099
The greatest bomber ever built,
the biggest assignment of the war.


1106
01:08:01.339 --> 01:08:04.035
That's not gonna be conference fighting.
Can you handle it?


1107
01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:07.440
l think l can, with the man
l've picked for my chief of staff.


1108
01:08:07.612 --> 01:08:09.842
-Who's that?
-Brigadier General Ted Martin.


1109
01:08:10.015 --> 01:08:12.279
Me? Chief of staff?
With all those papers?


1110
01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.418
Oh, adjutants do that.

1111
01:08:14.586 --> 01:08:16.281
We'll be a perfect team, Ted.

1112
01:08:16.454 --> 01:08:19.287
l'll fight the Navy,
and you can fight the Japs.


1113
01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:22.085
You might try to be more helpful.
Now, get back in there.


1114
01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.784
l wanna talk to Casey a minute.

1115
01:08:23.962 --> 01:08:28.092
l'm sticking around for the field order
to come through, then l'm going to turn in.


1116
01:08:30.268 --> 01:08:32.668
Did you listen to what
Congressman Malcolm said?


1117
01:08:32.838 --> 01:08:35.636
l've done nothing but listen
to Malcolm for the last hour.


1118
01:08:35.807 --> 01:08:37.672
Good heavens.
You must be more careful.


1119
01:08:37.843 --> 01:08:41.540
-He's not chairman, but he's important.
-He's no more important than the others.


1120
01:08:41.713 --> 01:08:44.011
Why should we be rattled
by one noisy individual?


1121
01:08:44.182 --> 01:08:46.343
The other fellows seem all right.

1122
01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:49.817
lt's precisely because Malcolm
is a troublemaker that l--


1123
01:08:49.988 --> 01:08:52.252
-Yes, Homer?
-Representative Malcolm is anxious...


1124
01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.949
...to get in touch with his nephew
as soon as possible.


1125
01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:58.584
-Could we ask Captain Jenks over here?
-You and l must be losing our grips.


1126
01:08:58.763 --> 01:09:01.254
Tell him that Jenks
will be here in a few minutes.


1127
01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:05.392
With all these things exploding at once,
l forgot all about the famous nephew.


1128
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:08.403
Let's make Malcolm happy.
Get Jenks over here fast as you can.


1129
01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:10.370
-Sir, l'm afraid--
-Say, hasn't Jenks...


1130
01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:13.102
...got another decoration coming up?
Get the citation...


1131
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:16.873
...and tomorrow afternoon l'll present
the medal to him in Malcolm's presence.


1132
01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:20.245
That's what l mean. l'm afraid
you're asking for something difficult.


1133
01:09:20.418 --> 01:09:24.047
You haven't been told yet, sir, but
Captain Jenks is in rather serious trouble.


1134
01:09:24.222 --> 01:09:25.211
Trouble? Young Jenks?

1135
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.052
Yes, sir. He flatly refused to fly
this morning's mission.


1136
01:09:28.226 --> 01:09:30.456
He's confined to quarters
pending further action.


1137
01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:33.154
What? Casey, you're--

1138
01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:37.097
Captain Jenks is one of the most
highly-publicized heroes in this Air Force.


1139
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:38.395
l know.

1140
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:42.028
Maybe he's had too much newspaper stuff.
My people feel that's his trouble.


1141
01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:43.970
-You've had him examined?
-Thoroughly.


1142
01:09:44.142 --> 01:09:48.101
The doctors can find no medical excuse,
and Jenks doesn't claim any.


1143
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.376
Mightn't this defiance, in itself, indicate
a certain neurosis or a psychic condition?


1144
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:54.643
Surely nobody will call Jenks
a simple coward.


1145
01:09:54.819 --> 01:09:57.549
No, sir. Cowards
welcome medical excuses.


1146
01:09:57.722 --> 01:10:00.714
ln any case, this is not quite the moment
to be decorating him.


1147
01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.860
Oh, Casey,
we've got to think of something.


1148
01:10:03.028 --> 01:10:05.690
Why, Malcolm wouldn't forgive
the Air Force.


1149
01:10:05.864 --> 01:10:08.298
-l know one way, sir.
-What?


1150
01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:11.993
lf Jenks had been acting under verbal
orders to hold himself in readiness...


1151
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:14.638
...for special escort duty
to his uncle's committee...


1152
01:10:14.806 --> 01:10:17.138
...he would have been justified
in refusing to fly.


1153
01:10:17.309 --> 01:10:20.244
Exactly, exactly, but why must you
do everything the hard way?


1154
01:10:20.412 --> 01:10:21.401
Get him over here.

1155
01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:25.447
l will, as soon as l've ordered
Schweinhafen for tomorrow.


1156
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:31.045
This is blackmail.

1157
01:10:31.222 --> 01:10:33.816
For the good of the service,
our bombardment is at stake.


1158
01:10:33.992 --> 01:10:35.755
lngenious, but you've got your orders.

1159
01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:38.987
Then at midnight, l charge
Captain Jenks with desertion.


1160
01:10:39.164 --> 01:10:40.153
Are you insane?

1161
01:10:40.332 --> 01:10:44.029
Don't you realize there'd be
an investigation, press attacks, publicity?


1162
01:10:44.235 --> 01:10:48.296
lf the Air Force can't attack what it should,
then an investigation may be a good thing.


1163
01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:53.342
How many years
have you known me, Casey?


1164
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:56.571
Have you ever seen anyone
who got away with blackmailing me?


1165
01:10:56.748 --> 01:10:58.147
No, sir.

1166
01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:00.475
All right...

1167
01:11:01.419 --> 01:11:04.047
...just so you don't
get the wrong idea.


1168
01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:07.315
-Are you releasing the division to me?
-You're a scoundrel, Casey.


1169
01:11:07.492 --> 01:11:09.084
You'll get us all hanged
in the end.


1170
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.718
Go ahead and name your own target
for tomorrow, on your own responsibility.


1171
01:11:12.897 --> 01:11:15.593
-l'll notify my headquarters.
-Thank you, sir.


1172
01:11:17.135 --> 01:11:18.466
--on the Greenland icecap.

1173
01:11:18.636 --> 01:11:19.694
Get me Colonel Haley.

1174
01:11:19.871 --> 01:11:23.432
The other crew managed to survive
by cutting off his leg....


1175
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:27.603
All right, this way, men.

1176
01:11:29.014 --> 01:11:32.415
Point out the man of the year to me,
l've only got one flashbulb.


1177
01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:36.645
Landing under extraordinarily
hazardous conditions....


1178
01:11:37.222 --> 01:11:40.851
Haley, call the 32nd and tell them
l want Captain Jenks released...


1179
01:11:41.026 --> 01:11:43.017
...from all restrictions immediately.

1180
01:11:43.194 --> 01:11:46.630
He's to report to my quarters at once
in class A uniform.


1181
01:11:50.635 --> 01:11:53.365
This is General Dennis. 
Major Rockton.

1182
01:11:57.375 --> 01:11:58.364
George...

1183
01:11:58.543 --> 01:12:02.536
...scrub those naval targets. Have you
still got the tape for Stitch in the printer?


1184
01:12:02.714 --> 01:12:04.511
Good. Send it out.

1185
01:12:04.682 --> 01:12:06.877
Bomb and fuel loadings
same as yesterday.


1186
01:12:07.052 --> 01:12:10.681
l'll help you with the routes and timings
as soon as l can get away from here.


1187
01:12:13.324 --> 01:12:15.292
How did you do it, general?

1188
01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:18.859
lt doesn't matter how, Mr. Brockhurst.

1189
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.327
lt's on.

1190
01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:49.826
<i>Yes, it was on.</i>

1191
01:12:50.528 --> 01:12:54.487
<i>Once again, Dennis' command
set the big machine in motion.</i>


1192
01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:58.568
<i>Bomb loads, fusings, target intelligence
plot Hitler's flak guns.</i>


1193
01:13:00.205 --> 01:13:01.900
<i>This was no raid tomorrow.</i>

1194
01:13:02.073 --> 01:13:05.440
<i>No gallant dash to the target
and out again.</i>


1195
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.702
<i>This was a battle.</i>

1196
01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:09.175
<i>Here and from other fields...</i>

1197
01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:12.748
<i>...hundreds of Forts and Libs
would rise at dawn...</i>


1198
01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:14.407
<i>...higher than men can dream.</i>

1199
01:13:15.253 --> 01:13:17.153
<i>Kids who worked in drugstores
last year...</i>


1200
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.158
<i>...played at the country clubs,
failed in algebra...</i>


1201
01:13:21.326 --> 01:13:24.090
<i>...would guide the formation
to the heart of Germany...</i>


1202
01:13:24.262 --> 01:13:26.753
<i>...with instruments
Marconi and Edison never knew.</i>


1203
01:13:26.931 --> 01:13:28.592
<i>The field order went down.</i>

1204
01:13:28.766 --> 01:13:31.291
<i>Division to combat wings,
wings to groups.</i>


1205
01:13:31.469 --> 01:13:34.233
Okay, there's a mission tomorrow,
maximum effort.


1206
01:13:34.906 --> 01:13:37.170
<i>Six hundred miles
through the fighters and flak...</i>


1207
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:41.502
<i>...fastened to life
by short hoses of oxygen.</i>


1208
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:44.842
<i>Six hundred miles to come home again.</i>

1209
01:13:45.016 --> 01:13:46.381
<i>Maybe.</i>

1210
01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:50.847
<i>A thundering battle force 30 miles long.</i>

1211
01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:55.693
<i>All this now
for a four-minute bomb run...</i>


1212
01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.261
<i>...over one small vital town in Germany.</i>

1213
01:14:00.565 --> 01:14:04.865
<i>Once more, the patient ground crews
loaded the tons of bombs...</i>


1214
01:14:05.103 --> 01:14:07.435
<i>...preflighted the engines...</i>

1215
01:14:09.374 --> 01:14:10.898
<i>...checked every wire.</i>

1216
01:14:11.075 --> 01:14:12.804
<i>On this base, as on all the bases...</i>

1217
01:14:12.977 --> 01:14:16.845
<i>...the combat men could sleep safe
in that knowledge at least.</i>


1218
01:14:17.015 --> 01:14:21.543
<i>Two thousand, seven-hundred eighty
gallons of gas in each Fortress.</i>


1219
01:14:21.719 --> 01:14:25.280
<i>Enough materials and guts
and skill to run a city.</i>


1220
01:14:25.456 --> 01:14:26.923
<i>Now it was nearly ready.</i>

1221
01:14:27.091 --> 01:14:30.117
<i>The men on the ground
had almost done their work.</i>


1222
01:14:30.295 --> 01:14:32.661
<i>The engines were still again.</i>

1223
01:14:32.964 --> 01:14:37.492
<i>The dark fields silent,
waiting for the crews.</i>


1224
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:48.507
<i>Three o'clock, and all over England
at this exact moment...</i>


1225
01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.648
<i>...they roused them from their sleep.</i>

1226
01:14:50.815 --> 01:14:53.716
We have a mission this morning.
Breakfast in half an hour.


1227
01:14:53.885 --> 01:14:54.909
Breakfast at 4:00?

1228
01:14:55.086 --> 01:14:57.452
<i>It had always
been a heartbreaker to watch.</i>


1229
01:14:57.622 --> 01:15:00.523
<i>But this morning, I felt the whole story
for the first time.</i>


1230
01:15:01.259 --> 01:15:04.660
<i>Not just the kids
who wouldn't come back today.</i>


1231
01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:06.854
<i>A deeper meaning in their sacrifice.</i>

1232
01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:09.559
<i>Dennis' fight...</i>

1233
01:15:09.734 --> 01:15:11.224
<i>...and Kane's.</i>

1234
01:15:11.402 --> 01:15:14.428
<i>Our own long carelessness at home.</i>

1235
01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.767
Your target for today
is Schweinhafen.


1236
01:15:19.711 --> 01:15:21.576
<i>It was all in the kids' hands now.</i>

1237
01:16:29.547 --> 01:16:30.912
Well...

1238
01:16:31.282 --> 01:16:32.840
...see you later.

1239
01:16:34.786 --> 01:16:37.186
-Keep your temper with the big wheels.
-What?


1240
01:16:37.622 --> 01:16:40.182
l said keep your temper
with the big wheels.


1241
01:16:40.358 --> 01:16:44.658
l don't wanna get back and find you
with a Legion of Merit and a ticket home.


1242
01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:58.156
-Good morning, general.
-Good morning.


1243
01:18:58.329 --> 01:19:00.695
-Good morning.
-Good morning, gentlemen.


1244
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:06.830
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


1245
01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:11.205
Well, this is really
worth getting up to see.


1246
01:19:12.043 --> 01:19:15.240
Let's hope and pray that all of our boys
will come back this time.


1247
01:19:20.785 --> 01:19:24.243
-ls that Colonel Martin?
-Yes, the first one.


1248
01:19:25.523 --> 01:19:30.324
You know, my boy, when l see all of this,
l can't help but feel a little bit guilty.


1249
01:19:30.495 --> 01:19:32.690
lf l weren't here,
you'd probably be up there...


1250
01:19:32.864 --> 01:19:34.991
...in Colonel Martin's ship
leading them today.


1251
01:19:39.737 --> 01:19:43.434
l suppose nobody ever really gets
used to this, does he, general?


1252
01:19:43.774 --> 01:19:45.139
Never.

1253
01:19:45.409 --> 01:19:47.070
l can imagine.

1254
01:19:47.912 --> 01:19:49.243
Weird.

1255
01:19:49.547 --> 01:19:52.880
The weirdest kind of war
on Earth, Mr. Stone.


1256
01:19:53.351 --> 01:19:57.151
A few hours from now, they'll be fighting
on oxygen five miles over Germany.


1257
01:19:58.322 --> 01:20:01.553
Tonight, some of them
will be dancing at The Savoy...


1258
01:20:02.026 --> 01:20:04.961
...and some of them
will still be in Germany.


1259
01:20:09.667 --> 01:20:10.656
-Yes, sir.
-Right-o.


1260
01:20:10.835 --> 01:20:12.462
The air crews should
hardly get their feet wet.


1261
01:20:12.637 --> 01:20:14.298
Hello, 1 6 Group.

1262
01:20:14.472 --> 01:20:17.737
Wrecked aircraft,
priority flying control, please.


1263
01:20:18.109 --> 01:20:22.045
Fifth division here. We have a B-1 7
early return reported fixed in the North Sea.


1264
01:20:22.213 --> 01:20:23.612
What do you know?

1265
01:20:23.781 --> 01:20:25.476
What's cooking? 
Something hot?

1266
01:20:26.017 --> 01:20:28.918
-That's something. Look at that.
-This calls for a celebration.


1267
01:20:29.153 --> 01:20:32.213
-lmagine that.
-Well, what do you know?


1268
01:20:33.224 --> 01:20:35.488
Here it is, George.
He really hit the jackpot.


1269
01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.458
-Strike signal already?
-This is Mrs. Martin's strike signal.


1270
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:40.392
Cable from the States for the colonel.

1271
01:20:40.565 --> 01:20:44.001
''New 8-pound copilot
made first landing 4:1 4 this morning.


1272
01:20:44.168 --> 01:20:45.635
Everything fine. Helen.''

1273
01:20:45.803 --> 01:20:47.361
Well, how about that?

1274
01:20:47.538 --> 01:20:49.802
Colonel Martin's got a son.

1275
01:20:50.474 --> 01:20:53.841
-Hold the phones....
-Enemy fighters attacking. Roger.


1276
01:20:54.011 --> 01:20:57.777
The German air force has been the balance
of power in the world ever since Munich.


1277
01:20:57.949 --> 01:21:00.509
lt took the German army
everywhere it's been.


1278
01:21:00.685 --> 01:21:05.213
lt beat the Polish air force in three days,
and the Norwegian in three hours.


1279
01:21:05.389 --> 01:21:08.688
lt forced the Maginot Line,
and beat the French in three weeks.


1280
01:21:09.393 --> 01:21:12.658
lt knocked off Yugoslavia
and Greece for practice.


1281
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:15.697
Captured Crete
and dominated the Mediterranean...


1282
01:21:15.866 --> 01:21:19.461
...and chased the Russians
back to Moscow and Stalingrad.


1283
01:21:19.637 --> 01:21:21.798
Now we've made them pull
whole groups...


1284
01:21:21.973 --> 01:21:24.669
...off the Russians
and away from the Mediterranean...


1285
01:21:24.842 --> 01:21:30.178
...and put them over there,
across the channel, facing us.


1286
01:21:30.648 --> 01:21:33.617
Gentlemen, you've had a glimpse...

1287
01:21:33.784 --> 01:21:36.582
...but all the complicated
activities of this division...


1288
01:21:36.754 --> 01:21:40.485
...are only a fraction
of General Kane's responsibility.


1289
01:21:42.026 --> 01:21:43.755
All right, Homer.

1290
01:21:44.328 --> 01:21:47.354
Gentlemen, you must make
the country understand...


1291
01:21:47.531 --> 01:21:50.659
...that the credit for what we do here
belongs to the boys.


1292
01:21:51.769 --> 01:21:56.866
Often at night,
l think on the parable of the talents.


1293
01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:59.805
lt must have been a terrible ordeal
for those men...


1294
01:21:59.977 --> 01:22:03.413
...who were trying to serve their master
as best they could...


1295
01:22:03.581 --> 01:22:05.776
...with what they were given.

1296
01:22:05.983 --> 01:22:08.144
You mean you want
more planes, General.


1297
01:22:08.319 --> 01:22:11.720
Mr. Stone, if the nation wants
aerial supremacy, we must have them.


1298
01:22:11.889 --> 01:22:14.289
The nation wants
aerial supremacy everywhere.


1299
01:22:14.458 --> 01:22:17.154
Excuse me. What is it, George?

1300
01:22:17.328 --> 01:22:20.092
A message l thought
you'd like to see, sir.


1301
01:22:23.234 --> 01:22:27.170
Well, it looks like it's going
to be pretty noisy over the 32nd tonight.


1302
01:22:27.538 --> 01:22:29.301
Congratulations, uncle.

1303
01:22:29.473 --> 01:22:33.341
Excuse us, gentlemen,
but this is a first-priority communication.


1304
01:22:33.844 --> 01:22:36.312
-Colonel Martin's got a boy.
-Wonderful.


1305
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.539
Well, l can't tell you
what this means to us.


1306
01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:40.944
l've known Colonel Martin for 1 5 years.

1307
01:22:41.118 --> 01:22:42.710
Why, this is as if l'd had a--

1308
01:22:42.887 --> 01:22:45.879
Well, l won't say a grandson,
but another son of my own.


1309
01:22:46.057 --> 01:22:47.649
-Wonderful.
-General Kane...


1310
01:22:47.825 --> 01:22:51.989
...it's an inspiring thing for us to come over
here and see the American flag flying...


1311
01:22:52.163 --> 01:22:56.031
...and to be privileged to inspect these
fine achievements of our bomber boys.


1312
01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.794
Howsomever, l'd like
to get back to this mission...


1313
01:22:58.969 --> 01:23:01.529
...that Colonel Martin is leading today.

1314
01:23:01.706 --> 01:23:05.733
General Dennis, if l may,
l'm gonna ask you a few questions.


1315
01:23:08.779 --> 01:23:12.408
You explained a while ago
that this was as far...


1316
01:23:12.583 --> 01:23:16.679
...as your bomber planes could depend
upon protection from our fighter planes.


1317
01:23:17.088 --> 01:23:20.615
And l think you also said
that for the third day in succession...


1318
01:23:20.791 --> 01:23:24.124
...your bombers have been deliberately sent
far beyond this limit.


1319
01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:26.526
-That's correct.
-ln other words...


1320
01:23:26.697 --> 01:23:29.894
...about half your plane strength,
and the lives of a thousand men...


1321
01:23:30.067 --> 01:23:32.092
...have been lost
within the last two days...


1322
01:23:32.269 --> 01:23:34.999
...and we still don't know
about this afternoon.


1323
01:23:35.172 --> 01:23:37.936
-Has this been entirely your decision?
-lt has.


1324
01:23:38.109 --> 01:23:40.543
-On nothing but your own authority?
-Yes.


1325
01:23:40.978 --> 01:23:43.674
General Dennis was quite
within his authority, Mr. Malcolm.


1326
01:23:43.848 --> 01:23:45.975
When these losses are fitted
into the average--


1327
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:48.641
Oh, l understand
the overall average, general.


1328
01:23:48.819 --> 01:23:51.515
And l appreciate your loyalty
to your subordinate.


1329
01:23:51.689 --> 01:23:55.989
But it seems to me our boys are paying
a bloody price for General Dennis' record.


1330
01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.321
They're paying a price
for the country's record.


1331
01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:00.964
So the country is responsible
for your sending them...


1332
01:24:01.132 --> 01:24:03.498
-...far beyond friendly fighter cover?
-Yes.


1333
01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:07.262
Or more precisely, some of the country's
elected representatives.


1334
01:24:07.438 --> 01:24:09.099
May l ask how?

1335
01:24:09.273 --> 01:24:13.004
How did you vote on appropriations
for the Air Force in 1 938?


1336
01:24:13.277 --> 01:24:15.302
-What?
-How did you vote on appropriations...


1337
01:24:15.479 --> 01:24:17.003
...for the Air Force in 1 938?

1338
01:24:17.181 --> 01:24:18.671
By golly, he's got you, Arthur.

1339
01:24:18.849 --> 01:24:20.612
Well, we'll see who's got who.

1340
01:24:20.785 --> 01:24:23.549
General Kane, l appreciate
that things can happen...


1341
01:24:23.721 --> 01:24:25.586
...at command when your back is turned.

1342
01:24:25.756 --> 01:24:28.281
But on behalf of the American people,
l'm warning you.


1343
01:24:28.459 --> 01:24:32.361
-One more of these murderous attacks--
-Arthur, it's not our place to criticize.


1344
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:35.931
-lf they think it's necessary--
-Necessary to slaughter American youth...


1345
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.762
-...just because a brigadier--?
-May l remind you again...


1346
01:24:38.936 --> 01:24:41.336
...our operations are governed
by military directive.


1347
01:24:41.505 --> 01:24:42.767
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1348
01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.340
While Major Lansing
briefs you further on details...


1349
01:24:45.509 --> 01:24:48.478
...General Dennis and l
will get some up-to-minute information...


1350
01:24:48.646 --> 01:24:52.412
...on where our planes are right now.
Casey. Major.


1351
01:25:07.765 --> 01:25:10.893
Casey, l've seen some bad things
in my time. This is it.


1352
01:25:11.068 --> 01:25:12.899
Why keep on antagonizing Malcolm?

1353
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:15.436
lt's been his lead so far.

1354
01:25:15.606 --> 01:25:19.804
You know the way l feel about you and
how the chief has always felt about you.


1355
01:25:19.977 --> 01:25:22.241
Well, this is bigger than any friendship.

1356
01:25:22.413 --> 01:25:25.507
You've heard Malcolm warn me.
l'm warning you.


1357
01:25:25.683 --> 01:25:27.514
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.


1358
01:25:27.685 --> 01:25:30.813
You wait here and cool off a little
while l try and smooth him down.


1359
01:25:30.988 --> 01:25:32.956
This is really my kind of war anyway.

1360
01:25:33.123 --> 01:25:35.091
You're welcome to it.

1361
01:25:35.359 --> 01:25:37.657
Everything arranged
for Jenks' presentation?


1362
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:40.058
-Plenty to drink?
-l hadn't thought of that.


1363
01:25:40.231 --> 01:25:43.200
Well, you better start thinking
in doubles and triples.


1364
01:25:45.035 --> 01:25:47.196
-Evans.
-Yes, sir.


1365
01:25:47.371 --> 01:25:50.397
-We gotta get some liquor in here.
-l could duck over to the club.


1366
01:25:50.574 --> 01:25:52.439
You haven't much time.

1367
01:25:54.678 --> 01:25:56.771
Now wait a minute.
l said, ''Mr. President....''


1368
01:25:56.947 --> 01:25:59.211
They're coming out
of the Ops room now.


1369
01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:02.044
l knew there was
a catch to this job.

1370
01:26:19.069 --> 01:26:21.594
-Where did you get that?
-Present from an admirer, sir.


1371
01:26:21.772 --> 01:26:23.034
And it still is.

1372
01:26:23.207 --> 01:26:25.107
Nonsense, you can get a fortune for this.

1373
01:26:25.276 --> 01:26:29.872
Oh, no, sir. There's just one thing l'd like,
sir, that's to shake your hand.


1374
01:26:30.047 --> 01:26:31.036
What's this for?

1375
01:26:31.215 --> 01:26:35.515
For telling that servant of the people where
to get off. l didn't know you had it in you.


1376
01:26:37.354 --> 01:26:39.822
Well, you better get
some water and glasses.


1377
01:26:41.191 --> 01:26:42.590
Evans...

1378
01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:45.119
...l appreciate this.

1379
01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:49.659
Well, sir, l'd hate breaking in
a new general.


1380
01:26:50.134 --> 01:26:53.900
Cycle relay reports Red Leader is on course

1381
01:26:54.071 --> 01:26:56.505
Reconnaissance reports
large formation of enemy fighters.


1382
01:26:56.674 --> 01:26:58.301
Did you get the strike signal yet?

1383
01:26:58.475 --> 01:27:00.136
All right, do that.

1384
01:27:00.778 --> 01:27:02.040
All right, this way, men.

1385
01:27:02.212 --> 01:27:04.772
Well, look here,
real American drinking whiskey.


1386
01:27:04.949 --> 01:27:06.940
Where in the world
did you get it over here?


1387
01:27:07.117 --> 01:27:10.780
-Looks as if the Navy's doing you good.
-Are you in touch with the relay ship?


1388
01:27:11.288 --> 01:27:14.553
Well, prepare a relay of that cable
about Ted's kid.


1389
01:27:14.758 --> 01:27:17.886
When he gets where we could reach him,
shoot it to his plane.


1390
01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:21.292
General Kane, are you fixing
to have this decoration ceremony?


1391
01:27:21.465 --> 01:27:24.263
Right now, Mr. Malcolm.
Just as soon as General Dennis--


1392
01:27:24.435 --> 01:27:26.562
l'm proud of you, son,
mighty proud.


1393
01:27:26.737 --> 01:27:30.138
Well, this is a happy coincidence,
my being here and seeing all this.


1394
01:27:30.307 --> 01:27:34.209
And, boys, l want a picture that will make
all America proud of the captain here.


1395
01:27:34.378 --> 01:27:36.141
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1396
01:27:39.683 --> 01:27:41.275
''No mistake this time.

1397
01:27:41.452 --> 01:27:44.512
Scratch Schweinhafen for me. Ted.''

1398
01:27:45.756 --> 01:27:47.883
-Haley, he got it.
-Good old Martin.


1399
01:27:48.058 --> 01:27:50.925
-Good for Ted, Schweinhafen.
-Gentlemen.


1400
01:27:51.095 --> 01:27:54.030
To Ted Martin, the greatest
combat leader in the Army Air Force.


1401
01:27:54.198 --> 01:27:55.825
-To Colonel Martin.
-Here's to Ted.


1402
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.434
-Wonderful.
-And to Colonel Martin's son.


1403
01:27:58.602 --> 01:28:02.038
-To Colonel Martin's son.
-To Colonel Martin's son.


1404
01:28:03.107 --> 01:28:05.371
Brockie, l want a featured story
on Ted for this.


1405
01:28:05.542 --> 01:28:08.511
General Kane, you seem to be forgetting
about me and Lucius here.


1406
01:28:08.679 --> 01:28:11.409
You wanted a picture to be proud of.
Will you get in this?


1407
01:28:11.582 --> 01:28:15.074
General, Colonel Martin's message asked
you to scratch Schweinhafen for him.


1408
01:28:15.252 --> 01:28:20.246
-While the photographers are still here--
-Lucius, stand by me. Come on, come on.


1409
01:28:22.259 --> 01:28:25.285
-Well, we're ready.
-Oh, excuse me, sir.


1410
01:28:25.462 --> 01:28:28.693
Would the gentleman like to put his glass
over here before it starts?


1411
01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:32.563
Oh, sure, sure.
You'll go a long way in life, son.


1412
01:28:32.736 --> 01:28:34.829
Pull your blouse down
over your hips, general.


1413
01:28:35.005 --> 01:28:36.404
Oh, yes.

1414
01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:38.669
Ready?

1415
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:42.343
Now then, l think we better
go ahead with the presentation.


1416
01:28:42.513 --> 01:28:43.810
Yes, certainly.

1417
01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:46.876
Come along, Lucius.
That's what we're here for.


1418
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:49.742
Attention to orders.

1419
01:28:50.854 --> 01:28:54.688
''Headquarters, 8th Air Force,
United States Army. Paragraph 2.


1420
01:28:54.858 --> 01:28:57.190
General order number 426.

1421
01:28:57.361 --> 01:29:01.092
For outstanding, heroic, and meritorious
conduct in action against the enemy...


1422
01:29:01.265 --> 01:29:04.598
...the following officers
are awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.


1423
01:29:04.768 --> 01:29:10.764
Captain Lucius M. Jenks, O-33902,

1424
01:29:10.941 --> 01:29:14.877
ln action against the enemy,
Captain Lucius Jenks has displayed heroic...


1425
01:29:15.045 --> 01:29:17.309
...and meritorious conduct--''

1426
01:29:46.143 --> 01:29:50.375
''Good luck, Casey.
We're on fire and going.''


1427
01:29:55.986 --> 01:29:57.419
Going?

1428
01:29:57.654 --> 01:29:59.747
Finish the message, can't you?

1429
01:30:00.057 --> 01:30:01.081
That's all there is.

1430
01:30:01.258 --> 01:30:03.192
Well, what's it mean? 
Who sent that?

1431
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.123
lt's from my ship.

1432
01:30:07.097 --> 01:30:08.428
You mean Colonel Martin?

1433
01:30:08.599 --> 01:30:11.124
That same fine officer
l shook hands with this morning?


1434
01:30:11.301 --> 01:30:12.768
-Shut up.
-You mean to tell me--?


1435
01:30:12.936 --> 01:30:14.836
-Shut up!
-You're telling me to shut up...


1436
01:30:15.005 --> 01:30:17.906
-...and you're the one that's responsible?
-Will you shut up?


1437
01:30:18.075 --> 01:30:21.238
Can't you understand that some guys
have to do more than talk?


1438
01:30:25.749 --> 01:30:27.307
Lucius.

1439
01:30:28.785 --> 01:30:30.719
-General Dennis--
-Arthur...


1440
01:30:30.888 --> 01:30:32.253
...l think you've said enough.

1441
01:30:32.422 --> 01:30:35.653
l'd advise you to follow
that suggestion, Mr. Malcolm.


1442
01:30:58.015 --> 01:31:00.950
Gentlemen, l'm afraid
l'll have to ask you to excuse me.


1443
01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:03.279
lt's time to start planning
tomorrow's mission.


1444
01:31:03.453 --> 01:31:05.421
Certainly, general.

1445
01:32:08.218 --> 01:32:10.846
<i>Right side, bandit at 2 o'clock.</i>

1446
01:32:11.822 --> 01:32:15.087
<i>-B- 1 7 on fire.
-Bandit at 3.</i>


1447
01:32:20.197 --> 01:32:22.529
<i>B- 1 7 going down at 3 o'clock.</i>

1448
01:32:22.699 --> 01:32:25.167
<i>Three chutes. Three of them got out.
Got that?</i>


1449
01:32:25.335 --> 01:32:27.064
<i>-Bombs away.
-More bandits, 6 o'clock.</i>


1450
01:32:27.237 --> 01:32:29.171
<i>Bombardier to crew.
Bomb bay doors....</i>


1451
01:32:29.339 --> 01:32:31.967
<i>-There goes another one.
-Bombs away. Bandit at 3.</i>


1452
01:32:32.142 --> 01:32:33.905
<i>-Bombs away.
-Lead ship's hit.</i>


1453
01:32:34.077 --> 01:32:36.170
<i>Yup, they caught Martin.
Number 2 is on fire.</i>


1454
01:32:36.346 --> 01:32:37.335
<i>Bomb bay doors open.</i>

1455
01:32:37.514 --> 01:32:39.641
<i>-Waist to pilot. Kelly is hit.
-Bombs away.</i>


1456
01:32:39.816 --> 01:32:40.805
<i>Pilot to crew...</i>

1457
01:32:40.984 --> 01:32:44.010
<i>...Colonel Martin is turning out of formation.
Deputy taking over.</i>


1458
01:32:44.187 --> 01:32:46.052
<i>-Bombs away.
-Bombs away.</i>


1459
01:32:46.223 --> 01:32:49.420
<i>Hey, how about that evasive action?
We're flying for ourselves now.</i>


1460
01:32:49.593 --> 01:32:53.029
<i>Come on, let's get out of here.
I've got a date in London.</i>


1461
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:21.555
Listen, Casey...

1462
01:33:21.725 --> 01:33:24.421
...the old man just said
that he's afraid you aren't well.


1463
01:33:24.594 --> 01:33:26.892
Take it easy. He's scared.

1464
01:33:27.764 --> 01:33:32.064
He wasn't scared back at Rockwell in the
'20s when he broke those altitude records.


1465
01:33:33.136 --> 01:33:35.331
You know, if it had worked out...

1466
01:33:35.505 --> 01:33:38.872
...l was gonna ask you
to let me have Ted for the Pacific.


1467
01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:41.169
l could have made him a brigadier
in a month.


1468
01:33:41.345 --> 01:33:43.279
Did Ted know that?

1469
01:33:43.447 --> 01:33:47.110
Maybe l shouldn't have,
but l mentioned it to him last night.


1470
01:33:47.751 --> 01:33:50.777
l wish l'd known it
at 3:00 this morning.


1471
01:33:52.656 --> 01:33:54.851
Someone will have to tell Helen.

1472
01:33:55.025 --> 01:33:56.652
l'll tell her.

1473
01:33:59.062 --> 01:34:02.088
Here it is, sir. These latest pictures
are especially interesting.


1474
01:34:02.265 --> 01:34:04.358
The weather will
hold up another day, sir.


1475
01:34:04.534 --> 01:34:07.230
l'll have a 1 400
map for you in a minute.

1476
01:34:09.206 --> 01:34:11.674
Oh, l thought you were alone, Casey.

1477
01:34:11.842 --> 01:34:14.276
Excuse us, please, gentlemen.

1478
01:34:21.284 --> 01:34:23.809
l know you've had
a lot to unstring you.

1479
01:34:23.987 --> 01:34:25.682
l'm sorry.

1480
01:34:27.591 --> 01:34:31.527
What target were you thinking of
for tomorrow?


1481
01:34:38.135 --> 01:34:39.898
Fendelhorst.

1482
01:34:42.939 --> 01:34:45.339
We got one more day
to finish Operation Stitch.


1483
01:34:47.377 --> 01:34:49.277
No matter what it costs?

1484
01:34:51.448 --> 01:34:53.006
You know the answer to that.

1485
01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:02.854
Casey, you leave me no alternative.

1486
01:35:03.026 --> 01:35:07.087
l'm relieving you of your command
with immediate effect.


1487
01:35:08.165 --> 01:35:10.099
l'm sorry, my boy.

1488
01:35:17.874 --> 01:35:21.241
l'm going to recommend
you for the Legion of Merit.


1489
01:35:31.421 --> 01:35:32.410
Mr. Brockhurst?

1490
01:35:32.789 --> 01:35:35.849
Well, you better get the lead out.
He's leaving at 1 0:00.


1491
01:35:36.026 --> 01:35:37.425
Right.

1492
01:35:48.405 --> 01:35:50.305
Good evening, sergeant.
Good evening, sir.


1493
01:35:50.474 --> 01:35:53.272
-Anything from General Kane?
-No, sir.


1494
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:57.879
-What's all that racket outside?
-Just some visitors from the 32nd, sir.


1495
01:35:58.048 --> 01:35:59.276
Well, call the guardhouse.

1496
01:35:59.449 --> 01:36:02.418
Excuse me, sir.
May l attend to this for you, sir?


1497
01:36:02.586 --> 01:36:04.110
Yes.

1498
01:36:05.655 --> 01:36:08.783
Hey, you out there.
Go back to your group and shut up!


1499
01:36:08.959 --> 01:36:10.984
Who's telling me to shut up?

1500
01:36:11.161 --> 01:36:12.219
l am.

1501
01:36:12.395 --> 01:36:14.056
Do you know who l am?

1502
01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:15.892
l don't wanna know who you are.

1503
01:36:16.066 --> 01:36:20.196
Well, l am
Captain George Washington Bellpepper Lee.


1504
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:23.703
Well, l am
Technical Sergeant lmmanuel T. Evans.


1505
01:36:23.874 --> 01:36:26.104
Oh, a technical sergeant, huh?

1506
01:36:26.276 --> 01:36:30.542
Speaking for
Brigadier General Clifton l. Garnet.


1507
01:36:34.184 --> 01:36:35.515
Thank you, sir.

1508
01:36:35.685 --> 01:36:36.913
Thank you, sergeant.

1509
01:36:37.087 --> 01:36:39.851
-Ask Colonel Haley to step in.
-Yes, sir.


1510
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:42.915
This is a very special night, sir.
They're veterans.


1511
01:36:43.093 --> 01:36:45.561
A little oxygen in the morning
will fix them right up.


1512
01:36:45.729 --> 01:36:50.063
You see, sir, they know they can fly
a milk run tomorrow sound asleep.


1513
01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.502
Does the division just assume that if l'm
left on my own l would order a milk run?


1514
01:36:54.671 --> 01:36:56.229
l'm not assuming, sir.

1515
01:36:56.406 --> 01:36:57.737
That's what l came in to ask.

1516
01:36:57.908 --> 01:37:00.376
Well, we'd better start
thinking about it, major.


1517
01:37:00.644 --> 01:37:04.705
Ask Major Lansing to bring me the folders
on the naval targets in France.


1518
01:37:06.116 --> 01:37:07.549
You asked for me, sir?

1519
01:37:07.717 --> 01:37:09.150
Yes, Earnie.

1520
01:37:09.319 --> 01:37:12.186
Does Kane usually wait this long
to give us the target?


1521
01:37:12.355 --> 01:37:14.380
That depends on what
the target will be, sir.


1522
01:37:14.558 --> 01:37:16.526
According to this directive
you showed me--


1523
01:37:16.693 --> 01:37:20.652
Yes, sir. lf we've no word from
General Kane's headquarters by 1 900...


1524
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:23.390
...the choice of the target
will be up to you.


1525
01:37:24.301 --> 01:37:25.768
l see.

1526
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:28.333
Tell me, Earnie--

1527
01:37:29.172 --> 01:37:33.108
Well, now that we're going to be so close,
couldn't you at least stand at ease?


1528
01:37:33.276 --> 01:37:34.766
Yes, sir.

1529
01:37:38.114 --> 01:37:41.413
Do you really think that the change
of command has helped morale?


1530
01:37:41.585 --> 01:37:43.644
All generals look alike to them, sir.

1531
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:47.483
They feel a new general is always good
for a couple of soft missions.


1532
01:37:48.725 --> 01:37:51.091
All right, Haley. Thank you.

1533
01:37:55.632 --> 01:37:58.567
-l didn't order coffee.
-You will, sir.


1534
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:03.005
-What else will l need, Evans?
-You'll need a new sergeant, sir.


1535
01:38:03.673 --> 01:38:05.038
What?

1536
01:38:06.309 --> 01:38:09.938
-You're going to work for General Dennis?
-No, sir. He wouldn't take me.


1537
01:38:10.714 --> 01:38:13.911
l've decided to go to Nevada
to teach gunnery.


1538
01:38:14.084 --> 01:38:15.949
You've decided?

1539
01:38:16.119 --> 01:38:19.885
-What do you think this Army is?
-l'd rather not answer that, sir.


1540
01:38:21.758 --> 01:38:25.250
But War Department circular 69587-3...

1541
01:38:25.428 --> 01:38:30.229
...says applications from graduate gunners
to teach aerial gunnery will be accepted.


1542
01:38:31.901 --> 01:38:34.665
Well, if the circular authorizes it....

1543
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.933
-Evans.
-Yes, sir.


1544
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:43.170
-You are a graduate gunner?
-Yes, sir, 28 missions.


1545
01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.573
Would it be too much to ask these boys
for a tough one tomorrow?


1546
01:38:47.751 --> 01:38:49.048
l don't know, sir.

1547
01:38:49.219 --> 01:38:51.153
You must know
from your own experience.


1548
01:38:51.321 --> 01:38:52.845
Never had this experience, sir.

1549
01:38:53.023 --> 01:38:57.119
Nobody in the Army ever
asked me anything. They just told me.


1550
01:39:16.746 --> 01:39:19.271
Captain Lee reports his presence, sir.

1551
01:39:19.449 --> 01:39:20.438
Who?

1552
01:39:20.617 --> 01:39:24.246
Captain George Washington
Bellpepper Lee, sir.


1553
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:26.252
Lee, you're drunk.

1554
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:27.988
Yes, sir.

1555
01:39:28.158 --> 01:39:30.456
l've come in to report myself
for that, sir...


1556
01:39:30.627 --> 01:39:34.893
...and to apologize for singing
under your window and then running away.


1557
01:39:35.865 --> 01:39:38.857
-Get out of here and go to bed.
-l'm sorry, sir.


1558
01:39:39.035 --> 01:39:42.129
This hasn't happened before
and it won't again.


1559
01:39:42.706 --> 01:39:44.071
Lee.

1560
01:39:47.777 --> 01:39:50.541
Did you go to Schweinhafen today?

1561
01:39:50.714 --> 01:39:54.548
Yes, sir.
l went to Schweinhafen today.


1562
01:39:54.751 --> 01:39:57.379
l went to Schweinhafen yesterday...

1563
01:39:58.088 --> 01:40:01.182
...and l went to Posenleben on Friday.

1564
01:40:01.357 --> 01:40:03.621
l've been to Hamburg...

1565
01:40:03.793 --> 01:40:06.353
...and Bremen and Kiel...

1566
01:40:06.529 --> 01:40:09.965
...Schweinfurt, 
Regensburg....

1567
01:40:11.534 --> 01:40:13.229
Excuse me, sir.

1568
01:40:13.403 --> 01:40:17.464
l only meant to say l've been to 24 of them
without taking a drink...


1569
01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.373
...and l'm ashamed of myself for singing
under your window on Easter Sunday.


1570
01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:29.145
You go to bed, Lee.

1571
01:40:29.319 --> 01:40:30.308
lt's all right.

1572
01:40:30.487 --> 01:40:32.512
Even if it isn't Easter Sunday.

1573
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:35.749
l beg your pardon, sir.
lt's my Easter Sunday.


1574
01:40:35.925 --> 01:40:38.359
-Yours?
-Yes, sir.


1575
01:40:38.528 --> 01:40:40.428
Resurrection, sir.

1576
01:40:40.597 --> 01:40:42.224
Today was my 24th.

1577
01:40:42.766 --> 01:40:47.294
See, all l gotta do now
is knock off one more little milk run...


1578
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:50.598
...and l can go home
and live the rest of my life.


1579
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:56.203
Well, don't behave like this at home.

1580
01:40:56.379 --> 01:40:58.210
l wouldn't think of it, sir.

1581
01:40:58.381 --> 01:40:59.973
l'm getting married.

1582
01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:01.845
Well, congratulations.

1583
01:41:02.018 --> 01:41:03.576
Yes, sir.

1584
01:41:03.753 --> 01:41:06.313
We almost did before l came over...

1585
01:41:06.489 --> 01:41:09.390
...but, well, sir, l thought
she'd worry more that way.


1586
01:41:09.559 --> 01:41:10.992
l see.

1587
01:41:11.161 --> 01:41:13.789
Well, you get to bed. Best of luck.

1588
01:41:13.963 --> 01:41:15.863
Thank you, sir.

1589
01:41:19.803 --> 01:41:22.601
And a happy Easter to you, sir.

1590
01:41:35.685 --> 01:41:40.452
Here are the folders on those channel port
targets, general. Calais, Dunkirk, Brest.


1591
01:41:43.426 --> 01:41:45.656
-What are these?
-Pictures from the last group...


1592
01:41:45.829 --> 01:41:48.855
...over Schweinhafen, sir.
Look at those hits on the milling shop.


1593
01:41:49.032 --> 01:41:51.125
They did a wonderful job.

1594
01:41:52.302 --> 01:41:55.794
-Then it's complete?
-Schweinhafen is complete, sir.


1595
01:41:56.005 --> 01:41:57.472
l see.

1596
01:41:58.575 --> 01:42:00.975
Major, l'd like to ask you a question.

1597
01:42:01.144 --> 01:42:02.668
Yes, sir?

1598
01:42:02.846 --> 01:42:05.747
lf you had to decide tomorrow's mission
for General Kane...


1599
01:42:06.349 --> 01:42:08.476
...would you attack Fendelhorst?

1600
01:42:08.651 --> 01:42:10.619
Fendelhorst, sir?

1601
01:42:10.787 --> 01:42:12.914
l'm thankful
l don't have to decide that.


1602
01:42:13.089 --> 01:42:14.317
But if you did?

1603
01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:18.620
Sir, l'm afraid my decision
would be influenced by a personal reason.


1604
01:42:18.795 --> 01:42:20.786
May l ask what it is?

1605
01:42:20.964 --> 01:42:25.401
General, l regret intruding this upon your
consideration, but since you ask me...


1606
01:42:25.568 --> 01:42:30.403
...l have a son training now
in a combat infantry division, assault.


1607
01:42:30.573 --> 01:42:32.700
When those jets have stopped
our bombardment...


1608
01:42:32.876 --> 01:42:36.607
...they'll make the deadliest strafing planes
ever used against ground troops.


1609
01:42:37.313 --> 01:42:41.511
l'm sorry, sir, but l couldn't help thinking
of my boy going up a beach against them.


1610
01:42:41.684 --> 01:42:44.983
Yes, but what if your boy were flying
a bomber tomorrow?


1611
01:42:46.456 --> 01:42:48.617
l hope l'd send him
to Fendelhorst, sir.


1612
01:42:54.397 --> 01:42:55.921
Message from General Kane, sir.

1613
01:42:56.099 --> 01:42:58.090
Good. Read it.

1614
01:42:58.268 --> 01:42:59.929
''General Kane compelled to attend...

1615
01:43:00.103 --> 01:43:02.230
...ambassador's dinner
for congressmen, London.


1616
01:43:02.405 --> 01:43:04.965
Pursuant to directive,
selection of tomorrow's target...


1617
01:43:05.141 --> 01:43:07.371
...will be responsibility
of senior commander.


1618
01:43:07.543 --> 01:43:10.910
General Kane desires express confidence
in General Garnet's discretion...


1619
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.880
...based on weather.
Signed, Malloway for Kane.''


1620
01:43:41.978 --> 01:43:45.846
l don't know about that. From the eccentric
way that cold mass has developed--


1621
01:43:46.015 --> 01:43:47.539
Never mind the genealogy, major.

1622
01:43:47.717 --> 01:43:50.083
The synoptic situation
will be highly unfavorable.


1623
01:43:50.253 --> 01:43:52.380
That will mean bad weather
for quite some time.


1624
01:43:52.555 --> 01:43:54.716
-And tomorrow?
-Well, tomorrow you're all right.


1625
01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:56.756
l understand that, major.

1626
01:43:56.926 --> 01:43:58.587
Oh, Casey. Sorry, l didn't see you.

1627
01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:00.956
Come in, old man.
That'll be all, gentlemen.


1628
01:44:01.130 --> 01:44:03.257
l'll let you know my decision.

1629
01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.492
-Goodbye, general.
-Goodbye.


1630
01:44:05.668 --> 01:44:07.602
See you at the plane, Casey.

1631
01:44:08.738 --> 01:44:12.367
-Bye again, sir. Good luck.
-Goodbye.


1632
01:44:13.343 --> 01:44:14.571
Goodbye, sir.

1633
01:44:14.744 --> 01:44:17.645
l hope l catch up with you again
one of these days.


1634
01:44:17.814 --> 01:44:19.782
l hope so, Lansing.

1635
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:24.311
Sir, when you get your new assignment,
l'd sure like to--


1636
01:44:24.487 --> 01:44:26.614
l'll see what l can do, George.

1637
01:44:30.226 --> 01:44:31.750
Sit down, Casey.

1638
01:44:31.928 --> 01:44:34.624
They reported my plane's ready.
Boys are loading my stuff.


1639
01:44:34.797 --> 01:44:36.628
Oh, what's all the rush?

1640
01:44:36.799 --> 01:44:39.461
The orders said,
''with immediate effect,'' Cliff.


1641
01:44:39.635 --> 01:44:41.728
l'm taking Ted's
personal things to Helen.


1642
01:44:41.904 --> 01:44:45.101
-Good. You'll go see her right away?
-Of course.


1643
01:44:45.274 --> 01:44:49.301
You got any idea of what
they're going to do with you?


1644
01:44:50.947 --> 01:44:53.882
Oh, l guess l still rate
a training command.


1645
01:44:54.317 --> 01:44:56.376
l'd like to get one
out west somewhere...


1646
01:44:56.552 --> 01:44:59.282
...where l could have Kathy
and the kids with me.


1647
01:44:59.455 --> 01:45:02.549
Get a day off now and then,
take the boy fishing.


1648
01:45:03.993 --> 01:45:05.187
Funny.

1649
01:45:05.361 --> 01:45:07.591
l was the boy
that wanted to fight the Japs...


1650
01:45:07.764 --> 01:45:10.062
...get that B-29 command.

1651
01:45:10.233 --> 01:45:11.700
l'm envying you already.

1652
01:45:11.868 --> 01:45:13.893
You've got a good job right here.

1653
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:16.766
-Good luck, Cliff.
-You can't run out on me like this.


1654
01:45:16.939 --> 01:45:18.907
What am l gonna do?

1655
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:23.841
You're going to command, Clifton,
and you'll be paid the first of every month.


1656
01:45:24.013 --> 01:45:25.207
l....

1657
01:45:25.381 --> 01:45:29.408
l had a boy in
to see me tonight. A pilot.


1658
01:45:29.585 --> 01:45:31.678
Nice, attractive young kid
with a lot of guts.


1659
01:45:31.854 --> 01:45:34.015
They're all attractive kids
with a lot of guts.


1660
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:37.887
l know, but he gave me
a kind of personal slant.


1661
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:40.955
There's no room in this job
for a personal slant, Cliff.


1662
01:45:41.864 --> 01:45:43.764
He told me he
was going to be married.

1663
01:45:43.933 --> 01:45:45.195
Yes, l know.

1664
01:45:45.368 --> 01:45:48.667
You can only hope you don't have
to kill him before he does.


1665
01:45:49.439 --> 01:45:50.770
lt's your baby, Cliff.

1666
01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.807
l found out long ago to let
the chaplain handle those.


1667
01:45:53.976 --> 01:45:57.275
He's our liaison with headquarters
that decides that.


1668
01:45:57.447 --> 01:46:00.610
Casey, what's happened to you?

1669
01:46:00.850 --> 01:46:03.717
The same thing that's going
to happen to you.


1670
01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.455
And the sooner l get out of here,
the sooner you'll get to work.


1671
01:46:07.623 --> 01:46:10.615
Yeah, but when you first came over here,
you had Ted to talk to.


1672
01:46:10.793 --> 01:46:13.318
-At least--
-Yes, l had Ted.


1673
01:46:13.496 --> 01:46:16.226
That's one thing l've done for you, Cliff.

1674
01:46:16.399 --> 01:46:18.264
l've killed Ted.

1675
01:46:18.434 --> 01:46:19.833
You won't have to do that.

1676
01:46:23.005 --> 01:46:25.530
Casey, you've hated this.

1677
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:28.805
Every minute of it, haven't you?

1678
01:46:30.713 --> 01:46:33.011
Oh, l've had worse commands.

1679
01:46:33.182 --> 01:46:35.343
You can be glad
you didn't have to run a group.


1680
01:46:35.518 --> 01:46:37.509
That is personal.

1681
01:46:38.087 --> 01:46:40.817
You see them at meals,
and you get to know a lot of them.


1682
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:43.117
lt's rough enough when you start
counting in...


1683
01:46:43.292 --> 01:46:45.487
...the really bad ones
you ordered yourself.


1684
01:46:47.463 --> 01:46:51.456
You'll find that you get their faces
all mixed up sometimes.


1685
01:46:51.767 --> 01:46:54.861
The kids just coming in
on the replacement trucks...


1686
01:46:55.037 --> 01:46:57.471
...and the ones you've already killed.

1687
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:02.978
But then when you start feeling sorry
for yourself...


1688
01:47:03.146 --> 01:47:05.614
...think of what
they've got to go through.


1689
01:47:06.415 --> 01:47:09.077
There's only one thing you can really do
for them, Cliff.


1690
01:47:09.785 --> 01:47:12.083
Make every one of them count.

1691
01:47:12.255 --> 01:47:15.019
See that they're not used up for nothing.

1692
01:47:16.959 --> 01:47:20.588
Maybe you can keep their kid brothers
from coming over here.


1693
01:47:26.469 --> 01:47:28.232
Here's the list prepared for you, sir.

1694
01:47:28.404 --> 01:47:29.393
A list?

1695
01:47:29.572 --> 01:47:31.506
Yes, sir. You ordered it, sir.

1696
01:47:31.674 --> 01:47:33.107
Read it.

1697
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:38.279
''Expectancy of losses from flak against
naval targets at French channel ports.


1698
01:47:38.447 --> 01:47:41.382
Brest, 4.9, Cherbourg, 3.4...

1699
01:47:41.551 --> 01:47:44.611
...Calais, 2.2, 
Dunkirk, 1 .6...

1700
01:47:44.787 --> 01:47:47.119
-...Dieppe, 1 .4--''
-That's enough.


1701
01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:56.025
Earnie, how did my goodbye present
to the boys finally average out?


1702
01:47:56.199 --> 01:47:59.965
The losses were 24 percent Friday,

1703
01:48:00.136 --> 01:48:02.468
...and 29 percent today, sir.

1704
01:48:03.706 --> 01:48:07.403
Quite a difference between those
and the channel ports, Casey, huh?


1705
01:48:08.377 --> 01:48:10.402
Many differences, Cliff.

1706
01:48:22.992 --> 01:48:24.459
Haley...

1707
01:48:24.927 --> 01:48:28.158
...notify the divisions
and all our groups...


1708
01:48:28.331 --> 01:48:31.027
...that tomorrow, the 5th division
will attack Fendelhorst.


1709
01:48:31.734 --> 01:48:33.258
Yes, sir.

1710
01:48:43.546 --> 01:48:46.014
General, good luck.

1711
01:48:46.782 --> 01:48:49.774
Save me a job in that training
command, will you?


1712
01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:55.683
Change of orders for General Dennis, sir.

1713
01:48:55.858 --> 01:48:58.349
-Oh, no, you don't.
-From Washington, sir.


1714
01:48:58.527 --> 01:49:00.654
l've got my orders. l've gone. Home.

1715
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.422
Sorry, sir. This is from the chief.

1716
01:49:02.598 --> 01:49:05.328
We're instructed
to relay the message to your plane.


1717
01:49:08.571 --> 01:49:12.007
''With immediate effect, General Dennis
will proceed via Gibraltar...


1718
01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:15.871
...Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta,
and Chongqing to--''


1719
01:49:16.279 --> 01:49:20.147
Casey, this is the biggest thing
that could happen to any of us.


1720
01:49:20.316 --> 01:49:23.046
lt means a B-29 command.

1721
01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.720
No. They can't.

1722
01:49:26.889 --> 01:49:28.754
They can't.

1723
01:49:38.134 --> 01:49:40.694
Cliff, does it say
''with immediate effect''?


1724
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:43.065
l'm afraid it does, Casey.

1725
01:49:45.608 --> 01:49:48.702
Think you could fix Sergeant Evans up
with emergency travel orders?


1726
01:49:48.878 --> 01:49:51.176
l'll walk them through myself, sir.

1727
01:49:58.321 --> 01:50:00.152
General, all the best.

1728
01:50:00.323 --> 01:50:02.086
Thanks, Brockhurst.

1729
01:50:02.625 --> 01:50:04.923
-So long, Casey.
-So long, Cliff.


1730
01:50:05.094 --> 01:50:07.722
-Goodbye, Casey.
-Goodbye, Earnie.


1731
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:10.664
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, sergeant.


1732
01:50:25.881 --> 01:50:28.441
lf the strike photos on Fendelhorst
are good tomorrow...


1733
01:50:28.617 --> 01:50:30.448
...why don't you send him one?

1734
01:50:30.753 --> 01:50:32.880
l already thought of that.

1735
