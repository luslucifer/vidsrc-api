1
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.100
The loading operations are
finish, half ready for take-off.


2
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.420
There a problem, Sergeant?

3
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.540
No, sir...

4
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.780
Sorry, I was just, uh--

5
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.860
Get your shit together.
We lift off in five.


6
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.660
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060
Hey, you're HALO qualified, yeah?

8
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.860
HALO?

9
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.540
No, sir.

10
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.540
Are we doing a HALO jump?

11
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.380
You'll be fine.

12
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.580
I'd go Fruit Loops.

13
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.780
My daughter loves them.

14
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.940
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting. I repeat.

15
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.660
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting.

16
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.860
Ah, fuck.

17
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.740
Going after a CIA asset
that's been captured.


18
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.420
The plan is to extract him
with minimal casualties.


19
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.500
He was gathering intel on Alexander
Petrov, a Russian arms dealer


20
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.660
and former KGB.

21
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.060
What's up?

22
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.540
That your family?

23
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
Nah, just a pic
that came with the helmet.

24
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.620
Yeah. Wife and kids.

25
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.260
Nice.

26
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.100
Are those the new 5.11 tactical gloves?

27
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.420
You know the ones with the Kevlar knit?

28
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.020
Yeah, yeah. Kevlar knit.

29
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.340
Awesome.

30
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.460
JTAC,

31
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.340
just try to relax, okay?

32
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.540
Right back the other way on
the Euro and gets that one to go.


33
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
And the whistle too...

34
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.300
That bad?

35
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.420
Yeah, that bad.

36
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.820
Do you wanna talk about it?

37
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.460
Wanna hug?

38
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.620
We can hug.

39
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.540
You need me?

40
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.020
Yeah, I wanted to ask you something, but...

41
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.860
Okay. Coffee?

42
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.700
Sure.

43
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.140
Okay.

44
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.020
Yeah.

45
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.740
Cool.

46
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.100
So, uh,

47
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.060
you know the wedding's coming up, right?

48
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.380
Yes, I do. Twenty-third.

49
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.220
That's right.

50
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100
You're not gonna change the date, are you?

51
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.700
What?

52
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.660
I've got everything organized.
I got the kids in place.


53
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.660
I got the ex-wives in place.

54
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.420
- Lucy will be out of the hospital.
- Reaper.


55
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.980
I'm not going to change the date. I,

56
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.980
um, actually wanted to talk
to you about something else.


57
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.860
I wanted to ask--

58
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.980
Who moved my shit?

59
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.820
Airman...

60
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.340
who moved my shit?

61
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.980
Huh?

62
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.780
Coffee pods.

63
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.740
I-
- I don't know, sir. 
I use the drip.

64
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.620
Well, I can't trust a
word you say then, can I?


65
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.380
Yeah.

66
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.420
I take the time.

67
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.100
Every goddamn morning.

68
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.660
I do it

69
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.300
for efficiency,

70
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.340
easy recognition,

71
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.620
and organization.

72
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.420
Is it appreciated?

73
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.420
No.

74
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.540
It is respected.

75
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.140
I think not.

76
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.420
But I do it

77
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.860
for the morale

78
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.740
of the squadron.

79
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.220
You were saying?

80
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.780
Op starts in 15.

81
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.100
Yeah, yeah. I thought you
wanted to talk about something.


82
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.860
It can wait.

83
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Shit.

84
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.660
You lose something?

85
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.540
Ah, just my cereal.

86
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.460
Your what?

87
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.620
Froot Loops.

88
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.860
I had a box of Froot Loops. I
don't know what I did with it.


89
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.260
Jesus Christ, Air Force.

90
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.740
Barely started this op and you're already
sweating about a box of Frosted Flakes.


91
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.700
No, no. It was-- it was Froot Loops.

92
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.300
Huh?

93
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.140
Froot Loops, not Frosted Flakes.

94
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.420
This kid for real?

95
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.540
Don't be an asshole.

96
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.340
That's cute.

97
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.860
Thanks, man.

98
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.980
Fucking Fruit Loops.

99
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.980
How old are you, Air Force?

100
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.380
Twenty-seven.

101
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.220
Ah...

102
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.540
Bishop, how old's your
daughter now? Twenty?


103
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.220
You should set Air
Force up on a date.

104
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.180
Yeah. I will shoot you in the
dick, Abell. I swear to God.


105
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.620
No, honey.

106
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.300
I can't.

107
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.660
I can't come.

108
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.100
'Cause I gotta be here

109
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.460
at work. Yeah.

110
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.100
Look, just get your sister to go.

111
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.100
What about your mom?

112
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.260
All right. Well, why don't you call...?

113
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.500
Oh, you called Judy? Uh...

114
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.460
look, okay, okay.

115
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.220
If it's only a couple
of things, that's fine.


116
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.420
That's fine. But right now, I gotta go

117
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.060
'cause I got a mission, yeah?

118
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.140
Zegler a little teardrop.

119
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.860
You know I don't like
that shot in college, right?


120
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.020
It's made about thirt-- yeah,

121
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.540
it's made about 37
percent of the time.


122
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.420
Fuck.

123
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.300
Zegler just settled for a tough
floater on the first side of the floor.


124
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.020
Guys.

125
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.820
I got a favor to ask you.

126
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.460
My wife is pregnant.

127
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.620
While I'm on OP, if she goes into
labor, she's gonna call that phone.


128
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.700
All right?

129
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.500
You need to answer it,

130
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.660
and you need to come and get me.

131
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.860
Copy?

132
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.300
Thank you very much.

133
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.740
And why don't we just keep
this volume down to a low level?


134
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.940
Because this is a
professional work environment.


135
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.740
Now, now. Just because your team

136
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.220
delivered the biggest choke
in March Madness history,


137
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.740
doesn't mean the rest of
us can't still enjoy ourselves.


138
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.260
It's about Lucy. 
Virgil, it's important.

139
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.860
I know.

140
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.460
Notice the, uh,

141
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.660
pseudofolliculitis

142
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.540
barbae hasn't

143
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.860
cleared up.

144
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.860
Not yet, sir. No.

145
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.220
Well, you just let me know
when you're ready to shave.


146
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.100
I will, sir.

147
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.740
All right.

148
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.300
- Go, Vols!
- Go, Vols!


149
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.020
Warhawk, this is Blackbird
approaching drop zone.


150
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.820
Headed to 15,000 feet.

151
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.540
Six minutes to the DZ.

152
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.380
Winds are five knots and to the southeast.

153
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.420
Skies are clear.

154
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.780
Happy hunting.

155
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.740
All right, boys. Six minutes.

156
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.740
Here we go.

157
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.060
Fruit Loop, now's the time
to be checking your weapon.


158
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.620
I'm good.

159
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.860
Not your Gameboy. 
Your actual weapon.

160
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.060
Hey, look, I'm in
charge of the drone. So...


161
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.620
if we wind up in a
situation and I'm shooting,


162
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.180
we got big fucking problems.

163
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.580
You're not wrong.

164
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.300
You're not wrong. JTAC's only good for one
thing and that is... "Bringing the rain."


165
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.260
Is this your first mission
in theater, JTAC?


166
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:16.820
Second.

167
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.820
But first with operators.

168
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.180
What?

169
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.980
Hell, I'll say it. Um...

170
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.380
we're about to head into a shit storm.

171
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.420
You still look like you kind of
need someone to wipe your ass.


172
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.660
So just... do me a favor.

173
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.420
Keep up and don't fuck up.

174
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.140
Last thing we need in this
op is to have to save your ass.


175
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.140
Nah, he's good.

176
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.740
Hey,

177
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.460
remember your training.

178
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.740
Talk to the planes.

179
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.500
When they start dropping bombs,
make sure it's on the bad guys.


180
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.420
Yes, sir.

181
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.380
You're not going to need these.

182
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.940
This is a sterilized op.

183
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.220
Be advised we are approaching--

184
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.340
All right, boys. Let's put our
masks on. Let's get to work.


185
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.300
Hey, JTAC,

186
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.060
this might sound stupid but
don't forget to breathe, yeah?


187
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.540
Stay on your comms.

188
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.020
When that hits 3,000,

189
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.380
deploy your chute.

190
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.140
It's just the same as airborne,

191
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.100
only way fucking higher.

192
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.300
Good to go.

193
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.780
I'll see you fuckers on the beach.

194
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.260
Yee-haw.

195
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.820
Hey,

196
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.380
walk in the park.

197
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.220
Fuck.

198
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.620
You good?

199
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.740
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

200
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.460
That ridge.

201
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.580
Four clicks by 0800.

202
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.660
Let's go. Let's move.

203
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.380
All right.

204
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.180
Sir,

205
00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.140
Thank you, Miller.

206
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.500
Okay, team has landed.

207
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.380
Operators are en route.

208
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.100
The drone is ten mics
out from rendezvous point


209
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.500
and Warhawk is switching comms.

210
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.820
This carriage is about
to turn into a pumpkin.


211
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.500
This is not my chair.

212
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.660
Yes, it is.

213
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.780
No, it is not.

214
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.860
Oh, my god, Reaper, I
did not take your chair.


215
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.980
I know you didn't take my chair.

216
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.260
It will be these commie
assholes from Shadow Flight.


217
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.180
You finished?

218
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.540
No, I'm not.

219
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.460
Eat a bag of dicks.

220
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.620
Now I'm finished.

221
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.660
Okay.

222
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.820
All right, let's take
this lady to the dance.


223
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.340
Playboy 06, this is
Reaper 1-0 checking in...


224
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.700
You have 1 MQ-9 in the air.

225
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.420
1 by BLU 118 on board.
Eight hours of playtime ahead.


226
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.700
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy

227
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.340
Roger. Standing by.

228
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.260
Grid as follows,

229
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.820
…November, Victor,

230
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.500
That's a friendly grid.

231
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.060
Roger, Playboy. I have
visual on friendly grid.


232
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.500
I am your eyes in the sky
and the bringer of doom.


233
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.460
Over.

234
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.540
Reaper is airborne.
Our location is confirmed.


235
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.660
What's the ordinance?

236
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.820
Two hellfire's and a BLUE-118, sir.

237
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.540
Lose the sir shit. 
I work for a living.

238
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.780
It's Sugar or Sug.

239
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.780
All right.

240
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.660
Makes him feel old.

241
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.580
He is old.

242
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.060
Thanks, Air Force.

243
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.060
Hey, JTAC.

244
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.940
What rock did they find you under?

245
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.820
In Guam on a training exercise.

246
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.540
Missed the flight out.

247
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.340
That was

248
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.860
nine hours ago.

249
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.860
How'd you miss the flight?

250
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.660
I had some stomach issues.

251
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.340
Wait.

252
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.780
You're here 'cause you had the shits?

253
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.620
Well, I hope you got
that all cleared out.


254
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.060
You shit your pants on an op,

255
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.980
that stain will follow you for life.

256
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.820
Did you get briefed?

257
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.380
Yeah, but I'm a little confused.

258
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.220
What about?

259
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.420
Well, I'm not tier one.

260
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.740
Yet he walks amongst us.

261
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.140
I thought operators don't go
out without tier one personnel.


262
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.140
We don't.

263
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.300
So why am I here?

264
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.860
A JSOC asset disappeared two weeks ago.

265
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.860
Believed to be kidnapped.

266
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.940
We've got intel on a possible locale.

267
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.540
So this is a rescue op?

268
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.580
Potentially.

269
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.460
Ah.

270
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.780
You can never keep up
with these CIA spooks.


271
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.860
Either way... here we are.

272
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.740
So to answer your question...

273
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.340
no, you shouldn't be here.

274
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.580
And, yes,

275
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.860
Delta doesn't usually go out
without their tier one personnel.


276
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.780
And, yes,

277
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.700
if our guy is here,

278
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.780
then we'll go in and fucking get him.

279
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.820
Translation...

280
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.060
step up your game.

281
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.380
I need someone to cover.

282
00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.540
Yeah.

283
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.100
I gotta check in with Lucy.

284
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260
How's she doing?

285
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.420
She's fantastic.

286
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.180
Got the baby brain going on though.

287
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.060
I gotta repeat everything five times.

288
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.220
It's amazing.

289
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.940
Absolutely huge.

290
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.740
Got the same thing about this wedding.

291
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.060
Uh, it's understandable.

292
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.460
There's a lot of detail.

293
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.460
You think about it.

294
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.660
A wedding is probably the
greatest social ritual humanity has.


295
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.620
You know,

296
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.460
most important day of your life.

297
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.820
Might as well get it right.

298
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.340
You're only going to do it once.

299
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.860
Reaper, you've been married four times.

300
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.580
Yeah, that's just me though.

301
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.140
I'm a romantic.

302
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.020
What did you want to ask me before?

303
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.140
Oh, I--

304
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:40.820
Hold that thought.

305
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.380
Thank you, Miller.

306
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.020
Reaper.

307
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.820
Hey, what's up?

308
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.300
Ah, this fucking frag is
a pain in my ass.

309
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.140
Thought you got that patched up.

310
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.060
I did.

311
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.740
So why are you still bitching about it?

312
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.180
There's still a fucking
hole in my leg, asshole.


313
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020
What happened?

314
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.260
I.E.D.

315
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.580
Some kid triggered
it from half a click out.


316
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.860
We never stood a chance.

317
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.540
Therein lies the problem, Fruit Loop.

318
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.980
All this tech, it takes

319
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.620
the
human element out of warfare.


320
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.620
And what happens when all that shit fails?

321
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.660
Well--

322
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.060
Well, what?

323
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.260
I don't know. I mean,

324
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.820
I think this tech saves lives.

325
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.340
In a way, it's takes the
barbaric nature out of it.


326
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.580
Barbaric nature?

327
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.540
Lipstick on a pig.

328
00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.220
You really think you dropping a bomb on 50 people
is any better than us shooting them in the head?

329
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.100
No.

330
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.540
No. War is barbaric.

331
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.300
It ain't never gonna fucking change.

332
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.580
It already has.

333
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.300
Listen up, Fruit Loop.

334
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.740
Let me tell you a story.

335
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.700
You can fight with all your robots and
your reapers and cell phones you want.


336
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.700
The end of the day,

337
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.740
when the technology fails

338
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.580
and all your--

339
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.380
your batteries and your bullets
and your bombs run out, you know,


340
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.340
and the fucking sun explodes,

341
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.780
war comes down to one very simple thing.

342
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.980
And that's man killing man.

343
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.860
Just takes one shit day to
change your whole perspective.


344
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.660
That's a fact.

345
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.700
Yeah.

346
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.740
Welcome to the land of bad.

347
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.300
Fucking great story, man.

348
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.620
Really fucking good, rich and compelling.

349
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.420
What do you got?

350
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.740
I got movement.

351
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.460
Hundred meters.

352
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.340
Just the other side of those rocks.

353
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.460
I need eyes over that ridge.
Hundred meters northeast.


354
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.260
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy 0-6.

355
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.860
Got suspicious movement a hundred meters
northeast of our position. Can you check it out?


356
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.980
Roger that, Playboy. Standby.

357
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.420
Hundred meters southeast.

358
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.500
Got good handshake.

359
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.940
Reaper 1-0, can you zoom in?

360
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.380
Copy that.

361
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.860
Yeah, oh, that's sexy.

362
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.340
Pan left, 50 meters.

363
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.940
Pan left, 50 meters.

364
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.140
What the fuck?

365
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.740
Reaper, I'm hollow, over.

366
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.140
Roger. Standby.

367
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.100
Systems malfunction.

368
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.460
Goddamn piece of shit.

369
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.060
Playboy, we have a systems
malfunction on the bird.


370
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.140
Copy that. Is the pod inop?

371
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.140
That is an a-firm, Playboy. We got
to get this piece of shit back to base.


372
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.740
Is another bird available?

373
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.740
That is a negative.

374
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.220
We'll fix this one up and
get it back to you stat.


375
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.420
Reapers down. No other UAV's available.

376
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.580
Broken Reaper, huh?

377
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.740
Ain't that some fuckin' irony?

378
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.500
Looks like we're gonna have to clear this ridge
the old-fashioned way. Abell, you're on point.


379
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.020
Copy.

380
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:12.700
Bishop,

381
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.380
you're left.

382
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.540
Copy.

383
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.060
What's the rest of our air support?

384
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.260
Hornet's on standby. 
Thirty mikes out.

385
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.700
What do you want me to do?

386
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.300
Nothing.

387
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.020
I got nothing on my end.

388
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.020
Same here.

389
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.940
Looks clear.

390
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.140
Wait.

391
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.700
Wait, I've got movement.

392
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.660
Ten meters.

393
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.220
Oh, for fuck's sake.

394
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.580
It's a fucking oink oink.

395
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.020
What the hell's an oink oink?

396
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.100
A fucking pig, dumbass.

397
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.980
Pretty sure you got a
picture of her in your wallet.


398
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.740
Fucker.

399
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.140
This is serious bad guy lair shit.

400
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.740
Got two tangos on the bridge.

401
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.060
A third on the far right.

402
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.300
Other side of the tent.

403
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.180
See a Starbucks down there?

404
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.460
I see number four on the
lower part of the S-bend road


405
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.300
Let's push down.

406
00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.100
Okay. Clear.

407
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.260
Clear.

408
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.140
Okay. We're gonna call this OP1. Air Force,

409
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.420
set up up top.

410
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.500
Abell, you stay put.
Set up your hindsight.


411
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.140
Bishop, you're with me.

412
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.060
We're gonna wrap around southeast.

413
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.300
Hooah.

414
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:43.860
You good?

415
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.620
Yeah, I think so.

416
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.180
Okay. Go forth and conquer.

417
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.580
All right, gents.

418
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.700
Sit tight.

419
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.700
Call out what you see. want a head count
on that compound before we move on it.


420
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.780
Sug?

421
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.780
When can we get
a nice gig in Hawaii?

422
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.020
Sick of swamp crotch.

423
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.860
I don't think they'd allow you
back in Hawaii since last time.


424
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.740
That was

425
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.580
one time.

426
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.100
Piece of shit. Fucking.

427
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.500
Got movement.

428
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.180
All right, this sure looks like our guy.

429
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.700
Bishop, can you confirm?

430
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.820
Yeah, that's Petrov all right.

431
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.100
Okay,

432
00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:50.940
if he's here,

433
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.100
the asset's gotta be close.

434
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.060
Thunderbolt Squadron?

435
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.020
No, it's not.

436
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.660
I'm sorry I can't do that for you.

437
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.580
You're gonna have to
call the operator back.


438
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.820
If you ask for extension 141,
that's Thunderbolt. Uh-huh.


439
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.500
Yeah, no problem.

440
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:22.860
Guys...

441
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.940
what the fuck?

442
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.580
What's the problem, Captain?

443
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.140
I asked you to keep
an ear on this phone.

444
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.700
Some smartass turned
the goddamn ringer off.


445
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.980
Why don't you turn it back on?

446
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.060
I have

447
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.660
Is your wife actually in labor, Captain?

448
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.620
On the precipice, sir.

449
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.860
Water's broken?

450
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.780
Impending.

451
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.780
Having any of those, uh,

452
00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.780
contractions?

453
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.380
Well, since you asked,

454
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.420
right now,

455
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.980
40 mics apart.

456
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.820
Last night, she was tooting like

457
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.220
a bugler at a Gettysburg reenactment.

458
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.100
Currently, her cervix is

459
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.460
two centimeters dilated
and starting to yawn.


460
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.060
All right, that is too much information.

461
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.140
Yes, it is, sir.

462
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.580
Airmen, for the love of God,
make sure that phone's turned on.


463
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.060
Thank you.

464
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.460
Contact.

465
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.140
Multiple vehicles
inbound. Eleven o'clock.


466
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.580
Oh, Petrov is on the move.

467
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.100
Who the hell are these guys?

468
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.060
Identify yourselves!

469
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:01.820
Don't know.

470
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.740
Local militia?

471
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.340
Kinda looks like Abu Sayyaf.

472
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.980
Bishop, can you confirm?

473
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.420
Yeah, I can't tell.

474
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.220
More guys with guns.

475
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.140
Sure as shit ain't taking
this compound 'til they leave.


476
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.380
Check out the dude getting out
the left side of the lead vehicle.


477
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.140
Tell me that doesn't
look like Saeed Hashimi.


478
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.420
Fuck.

479
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.580
Who's that?

480
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.020
Head of Abu Sayyaf.

481
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.020
Sure he's here to buy guns.

482
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.340
Keep your eyes open.

483
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.780
Guns on safety.

484
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.220
JTAC, what's the status of our air?

485
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.500
Reaper still down, 
Hornet on standby.

486
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.860
You want it airborne?

487
00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.100
Negative.

488
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.460
Sit tight. Let me work
on a new game plan.


489
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.020
Yo,

490
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.140
drone's fixed.

491
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.500
Handover in five.

492
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.660
I'm ready.

493
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.100
Fuck.

494
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.140
Playboy,

495
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.300
this is Reaper 1-0, back
on station. Checking in.


496
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.700
Requesting permission to establish overhead

497
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.660
Copy that. Good to have you back, Reaper.

498
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.740
Grid is as follows,

499
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:47.580
November, Victor,

500
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.260
Copy grid, Playboy.

501
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.860
I have contact.

502
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.980
Open circular compound,
one large concrete structure,


503
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.300
and a road heading north crossing a dam.

504
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.100
Confirm target area.

505
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.180
Roger that, you have target area in sight.

506
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.060
I didn't know Hashimi
was in bed with Petrov.


507
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.860
Oh, Hashimi's a terrorist.

508
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.340
He's got to buy his guns from somewhere

509
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.660
Come.

510
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.420
Come here.

511
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.860
The miss doesn't
look too thrilled about it.


512
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.260
Yeah, this guy's definitely a creeper.

513
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.140
She's getting stranger
danger vibes for sure.


514
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.260
Hashimi and Petrov sitting in a tree

515
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.540
K
-I
-S
-S...

516
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.180
Fuck.

517
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.740
Go away!

518
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.300
Run! Run, run, run.

519
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.180
Oh, fuck.

520
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.540
Take him!

521
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.460
Run!

522
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.540
What the fuck, Sugar?
What are we doing?


523
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.020
Warhawk, this is Alpha 1.

524
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.420
Have hostiles engaging with
civilians. Requesting updated


525
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.980
Make him see.

526
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.540
Allahu Akbar!

527
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.260
Fuck me.

528
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.260
Oh fuck...

529
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.460
Motherfucker!

530
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.460
Jesus Christ!

531
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.140
Petrov,

532
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.500
Papa!

533
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.180
Fuck this, Sugar, I ain't watching
this asshole lob off the kid's head.


534
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.100
Papa!

535
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.620
Kinney, stand by for
potential diversion.


536
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.020
Reaper, we need weapons effects
between the compound and the tent. Over.


537
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.100
Reaper 1-0. One by
hellfire missile, copied.


538
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.460
Papa!

539
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.180
Abell, Bishop, you got a shot, you
take it. Kinney, drop that fucking bomb.


540
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.740
Reaper, you are cleared hot!
Say again, you are cleared hot!


541
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.740
Copied.

542
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.820
Target acquired.

543
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.580
Weapon's away. 
Impact 30 seconds.

544
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.300
No! Papa!

545
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.420
Don't have thirty.

546
00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.140
Run!

547
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.740
Run, kid. Run!

548
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.500
Guys?

549
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.540
It's a fucking cave entrance.

550
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.060
Kinney, you've got hostiles directly below
you. Do not move. Do not even breathe.


551
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.980
Abell, Bishop,

552
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.700
I need sights on targets.

553
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.460
Abell, you taking center. Bishop,
extreme left. I'm on extreme right.


554
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.460
On one...

555
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.260
In position.

556
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.700
On one.

557
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.780
Three

558
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:06.620
two,

559
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.660
one,

560
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.860
Kinney!

561
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.620
Fuck!

562
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.580
Shit. Abell, you've got five
hostiles on your six. Fifty meters.


563
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.500
Bishop, move. On me!

564
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.500
All right, Abell.

565
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.100
Kinney, I need...

566
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.980
Stay still, asshole.

567
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.140
A little help here, fellas!

568
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.500
Trying, buddy.

569
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.380
Kinney, I need you to lay
down some cover fire for Abell.


570
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.940
Sug...

571
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.460
Yeah.

572
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.500
We got a situation.

573
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.020
No shit.

574
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.100
We got another situation.
RPG twelve o'clock. Incoming!


575
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.740
Motherfucker!

576
00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.260
Motherfucker!

577
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.020
I got you, man. I got you.

578
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.460
Okay.

579
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.460
You're good, man.

580
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.020
No, you're good, man. You're
good. You're good. I got you.


581
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.300
Where's the med kit?

582
00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.420
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

583
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.180
Come on, man. Where's the med kit?

584
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.300
Kinney.

585
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.220
Kinney.

586
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.700
Abell, Abell. No, no, no.

587
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.460
Fuck, fuck. Oh, fuck!

588
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.580
Abell is down. 
Abell is down.

589
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.700
Hello?

590
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.620
Oh, fuck.

591
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.180
Oh, fuck. Alpha 1, this Playboy.

592
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:01.780
Kinney,

593
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.540
listen to me.

594
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.980
We are taking heavy fire
from two two-man RPG teams.


595
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.780
I need some bombs down there now!

596
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.580
Wait, wh-what about Abell?

597
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.220
Abell is dead.

598
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.460
He's dead. I need you to stay
focused, Sergeant. Get yourself together.


599
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.500
Oh, fuck.

600
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.700
Reaper, we're taking RPG fire on
the southeast side


601
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.300
of the compound. Two hundred
meters south of my position.


602
00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.140
Give me the biggest
thing you got. Cleared hot.


603
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.500
Copy that, Playboy. We
have eyes on the target.


604
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.780
1 by Blu 118.

605
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.140
Weapons away.

606
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.100
Impact 20 seconds.

607
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.460
Where's that bomb, Sergeant?

608
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.860
Twenty seconds!

609
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.860
RPG incoming!

610
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.780
Fuck! Sugar?

611
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.540
Sugar? Bishop!

612
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.140
Oh, shit.

613
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.220
Fuck!

614
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.140
You got eyes on him?

615
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.500
Lost him in the smoke.

616
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.500
Fuck.

617
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.620
Did he pop the smoke?

618
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.420
I don't know.

619
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.460
Playboy, do you copy?

620
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.340
I see him.

621
00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.220
Stay with him.

622
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.700
Reaper? Reaper, you there?

623
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.860
Reaper?

624
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.140
Reaper, you there?

625
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.100
We're here, Playboy.

626
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.540
Give me the status of your team.

627
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.460
Uh,

628
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.060
KIA.

629
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.580
Okay, Playboy, let's

630
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.540
do this by the numbers.

631
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.860
Confirm your current grid location.

632
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.780
Yeah.

633
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.860
Uh,

634
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:29.100
I'm headed northeast.
November, Romeo, 2-7-6- 0-niner-3-2-2.


635
00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.420
I'm, uh--

636
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:32.700
I'm approx

637
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.860
five clicks from the evac point.

638
00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.380
I need you to scan forward 500
meters and make sure the area is clear.


639
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.780
Copy, Playboy. We got you.

640
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.020
Scanning forward 500 meters. Standby.

641
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.620
Yeah, area's clear.

642
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.660
Area looks clear. 
You're good to move.

643
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.300
Playboy, do you copy?

644
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.500
Playboy?

645
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.180
What's he doing? Is he moving?

646
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.260
He's freaking out.

647
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.980
You gotta calm him down.

648
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.620
Hey, Playboy. Good news.

649
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.140
Helicopter is inbound to the evac
point. The cavalry is on the way.


650
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.860
You gotta get your
ass on the move, son.

651
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.700
You got to move, man. Let's go.

652
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.820
Come on, soldier.

653
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.460
Get up and go.

654
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.340
Here we go. All right.

655
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.260
You scan forward. I've got him.

656
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.420
Scanning forward.

657
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.740
Tell me what you see.

658
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.940
Reaper,

659
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.620
I think I'm hearing a truck.

660
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.540
He's right.

661
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.500
I have contact from the west.

662
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.820
Truck on the road, half a click.

663
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.740
I have contact from the east.

664
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.740
Looks like they're converging
on Playboy's position.


665
00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.980
Playboy, be aware. You have
converging targets east and west.


666
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.620
How much ordinance do you have left?

667
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.020
One by hellfire. Air to
ground 114. Standing by.


668
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.860
You want those hornets airborne?

669
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.060
Negative.

670
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.300
Okay, Playboy, tally. Eyes
on target. What you want to do?


671
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.540
Keep eyes on it.

672
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.260
Roger that. Standing by.

673
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.620
Reaper, do you have eyes on hostiles?

674
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.700
Confirmed hostiles from the east are armed.

675
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.740
Are they Abu Sayyaf?

676
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.380
They've got weapons.
Safe to assume.


677
00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.620
Playboy, you copy?

678
00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.140
Can't talk right now.

679
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.740
Ah, for fuck's sake. Playboy, Playboy.

680
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.380
Canine coming your way.

681
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.580
You gotta be shitting me.

682
00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.780
Git.

683
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.260
Fuck, Playboy.

684
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.740
Buffalo Bill has dismounted.
He is approaching your position.


685
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.460
Looks like he's coming towards Lassie.

686
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.980
Do not move.

687
00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.700
Playboy,

688
00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.300
Buffalo Bill is above your
position. Do not move.


689
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.700
Okay, Playboy. Looks
like Lassie's going home.


690
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.780
Buffalo Bill has remounted.

691
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.540
Hostiles are leaving the party. Stand by.

692
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.060
Goddammit.

693
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:51.860
Playboy,

694
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.180
Buffalo Bill and his buddy
are gone. The truck is gone.


695
00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.300
You are clear tracking

696
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.100
There's a path up that
ridge on your one o'clock.


697
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.340
Hey, Playboy,

698
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:35.980
how you holding up?

699
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.540
I'm all right.

700
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.100
Where are you from, man?

701
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.820
Ohio.

702
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380
No shit.

703
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.620
Me, too.

704
00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.060
Brook Park.

705
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.500
Middleburg Heights.

706
00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.420
We're basically fucking neighbors.

707
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.620
O
-H.

708
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.620
I
-O.

709
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.620
Fellow Buckeye.

710
00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.140
Get home much?

711
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.260
Yeah.

712
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.420
Yeah, I was just there.

713
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.020
Had to bury my father.

714
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.580
Oh, man. Sorry to hear.

715
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.020
Yeah, it's okay.

716
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.460
Were you guys close?

717
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.780
Yeah.

718
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.620
Yeah, he was a good guy.

719
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.060
In Sweet Sixteen news, the fucking Buckeyes

720
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.300
just shit the bed against VCU.

721
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.740
First round.

722
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.860
Trying to depress me more?

723
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.740
Sorry, man.

724
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.340
Hey, you ever got up to
Mama Santas on Mayfield?


725
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.220
Are you kidding me?

726
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.740
I lived at that place during high school.

727
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.300
Fucking great.

728
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.540
I know, right? I met
my first wife there in '95.


729
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.100
Oh, yeah?

730
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.620
Yeah. We met in line.

731
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.220
We both ordered stromboli.

732
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.340
Who the fuck orders stromboli?

733
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.740
I know, right?

734
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.420
I thought it was meant to be.

735
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:26.700
And it was.

736
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.580
Right up until it wasn't,

737
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.700
you know?

738
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.860
My current wife hates the shit.

739
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:35.620
She jealous?

740
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.780
Nah, man, worse...

741
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.660
she's vegan.

742
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.740
Ah, man. That is worse.

743
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.540
How do you know if someone's a vegan?

744
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.660
How?

745
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.460
They will tell you.

746
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.620
You're getting really close now,
man. Just keep up the pace. Good work.


747
00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.860
ETA on the helo?

748
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.620
Playboy 0-6, this is Blackbird 2-5,

749
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.700
approaching LZ from east.

750
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.340
ETA three mikes, over.

751
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.340
Copy.

752
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.020
Reaper, how's my path to the LZ?

753
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.060
Clear.

754
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.700
Path is clear.

755
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.100
Time to get the hell
out of dodge, Playboy.


756
00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.660
Thanks for the eyes, Reaper.

757
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.100
Happy to do it.

758
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.260
Hey, drop me a line
next time you're in Vegas.


759
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.100
I have a solid
hookup for Disney on Ice.

760
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:28.540
You lost me.

761
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.140
I might pass on that,

762
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.620
but I'm at Nellis all the time.

763
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.820
I'm here, man. Call CENTCOM.

764
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.780
Raven Squadron. Eddie Grim.

765
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.140
Just ask for Reaper.

766
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.260
Will do.

767
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.620
Blackbird 2-5, I have a
visual. LZ is clear for extract.


768
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.220
Marking position with I
-R.

769
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.260
Roger that, Playboy. I
have your position marked.


770
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.300
Contact! I'm hit! I'm hit!

771
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.780
Playboy, are you injured?

772
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.380
Negative!

773
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.540
Must have hit my plate.

774
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.060
Reaper, hostiles, 100 meters
east. Two hundred meters south.


775
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.420
Contact! Blackbird. I have
multiple targets around the LZ.


776
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.580
Contact, Blackbird. Three
more hostiles on the west ridge


777
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.180
Small arms and an RPG.

778
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.500
Better move your ass.

779
00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.460
RPG!

780
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.740
Shit!

781
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.340
Blackbird, can you stay in the
area until we can find a secure LZ?


782
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.420
Negative, Playboy.
LZ is too hot.


783
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.220
Back to you as fast as we can.

784
00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.620
Shit!

785
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.860
Reaper, west ridge.

786
00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.020
Contact, Playboy.

787
00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.820
Three more trucks right through.

788
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.340
Reaper, need the bomb

789
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.020
Cleared hot!

790
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.420
Roger that, Playboy.

791
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.500
Tally. Eyes on target.

792
00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.980
Stay where you are, assholes.

793
00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.940
Stay where you are, assholes.

794
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.300
Weapon away. Impact 20 seconds.

795
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.860
Target is down. Now
get the fuck out of there.


796
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.980
Fuck! Taking fire.

797
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.860
This ain't done.

798
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.060
Got another truck
coming in from the west.


799
00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.820
Jesus Christ, I'm pinned down.

800
00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.580
How are they seeing me?

801
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:00.420
It's his strobe!

802
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.980
They must have night vision.
He's gotta turn his strobe off.


803
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.740
It's your strobe, Playboy.
Turn off your strobe.


804
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.260
Taking fire from the east.
Drop everything you have.


805
00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.580
Playboy, I am Winchester.
I'm out of bombs.


806
00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.300
ETA on the hornets is two mikes.

807
00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.140
Playboy... this is Hornet 1.

808
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.060
Entering point out level.

809
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.220
I'm coming in on an east west heading.

810
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.660
Roger that, Hornet 1.

811
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.620
I'm 200 meters north of target
grid.


812
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.580
Keep all fire south of target grid.

813
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.340
I say again, all fire south.

814
00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.620
Copy that. Be advised
this will be danger close.


815
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.100
Yes, yes. Cleared hot.

816
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.100
Copy.

817
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.180
Three, two, one!

818
00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.420
Shit!

819
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.060
Still taking fire from west!

820
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.180
Copy, Playboy. Coming
around for another run.


821
00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.020
Fuck!

822
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.420
Fuck this!

823
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.300
What do you want, Airman?

824
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.740
- Yeah, I'm doing a Starbucks run.
- Moving!


825
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.100
Colonel Packett is springing.

826
00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:20.820
A what?

827
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.540
Starbucks.

828
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.060
Have you lost your mind?

829
00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.060
Airman, leave!

830
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.220
Eyes on that hornet.

831
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.460
Give me some fire on the west ridge.

832
00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.700
You're cleared hot.

833
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.740
Confirm. West or east?

834
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.020
West! West!

835
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.220
Copy that. This one is
going to be danger close.


836
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.820
We still do not have visual on you.

837
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.580
It's fine. Just drop
it! You're cleared hot!


838
00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.460
Be advised, this is danger close.

839
00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.180
Altitude.

840
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.220
Altitude.

841
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.300
Pull up.

842
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.180
Pull up.

843
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.260
Playboy, I am Winchester.

844
00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.060
Hornet 1 is RTB.

845
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.660
Copy that.

846
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.220
Good shooting.

847
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.980
How's it looking, Reaper?

848
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.660
Playboy, from what we
can see, it looks clear.


849
00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.620
These fuckers know
we're out there now, so...


850
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.620
do not discount any surprises.

851
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.020
We got another LZ?

852
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.140
There's a clearing

853
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.820
two clicks northeast
of your position.


854
00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.420
You're not gonna like it though.

855
00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.220
You say northeast?

856
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.100
A-firm, Playboy.

857
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.100
Northeast is up a big fucking hill.

858
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.140
I know, man. I told you,
you weren't gonna like it.


859
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.260
I'm sorry, but that is the
closest LZ option we have.


860
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.860
Playboy, the helo is airborne.

861
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:24.220
ETA to the alternate
LZ is 90 mikes.


862
00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.060
You copy?

863
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.780
Yeah, I'm here.

864
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.420
How you doing, man?

865
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060
Pretty gassed.

866
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.700
Yeah, no doubt.

867
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.620
Hang in there, okay?

868
00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.620
Sorry about the failed evac, man.

869
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.540
Now you know.

870
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.780
Don't trust Air Force Captains.
Traditionally, we are full of shit.


871
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:54.660
Captain?

872
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.460
Yeah.

873
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.820
You said you met
your first wife in '95.

874
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.180
Yeah, I am old as shit. I
should be a general by now.


875
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:07.180
I got three ex-wives. I got eight kids. I
got a new wife. I got a new kid on the way.


876
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.260
I need the active duty bonuses.

877
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.180
If I go out from Captain, they'll
make me an instructor, so fuck that.


878
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.300
You fly fixed wings before the birds?

879
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.860
That is a very long story, my friend.

880
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.140
But, yes, originally, I
did sign up to be a pilot.


881
00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.180
But apparently, the Air Force thought

882
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.180
my responses to authority were not normal.

883
00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.420
So that goat got fucked.

884
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.060
Subtle.

885
00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.260
What happened?

886
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.380
Well, I shot my big mouth off,

887
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:45.460
and I found myself
reassigned to USAF-SF


888
00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.620
guarding shit in the middle
of nowhere for 20 years.


889
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.660
Eareckson Base in the
Aleutian, Pine Gap in Australia...


890
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.580
Playboy, do you copy?

891
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.340
Playboy, do you copy?

892
01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.740
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

893
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.060
What happened?

894
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.580
Slid halfway down
a fucking mountain.


895
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.260
Oh, fuck, man. You okay?

896
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.260
You hurt?

897
01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.660
Yeah. Just my pride.

898
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.580
Uh, Reaper, I've got
movement in front of Playboy.


899
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.980
One hundred meters northwest.

900
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:30.620
Zoom in.

901
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.980
Three armed hostiles.

902
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.860
Playboy, you have three
hostiles heading your way.


903
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.020
Find cover.

904
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.180
Find cover.

905
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.620
Fuck.

906
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.220
Shit.

907
01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.660
Scan forward. Keep me with him.

908
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.380
Copy.

909
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.140
Got him?

910
01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.380
I'm looking. I'm looking.

911
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.540
Fuck.

912
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.180
I got him

913
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.620
He's heading downstream.

914
01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.020
God fucking dammit!

915
01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.420
Get me the colonel.

916
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.260
Yeah.

917
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.620
Keep looking.

918
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.780
I lost him under the canopy.

919
01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.780
Fuck.

920
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.620
Reaper, what's the sitrep?

921
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.420
This mission has
gone to shit, Colonel.


922
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.780
I got an op who's been taken.

923
01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.340
We are 12 hours in.

924
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.420
I'm Winchester, but we cannot leave the
target area because we have the only eyes.


925
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.620
Requesting permission to stay in
the chair until we get the soldier home.


926
01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.700
How you feeling?
Are you feeling sharp?


927
01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.780
Oh yeah.

928
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.860
Sharp as an elephant's ass.

929
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:21.660
Staff Sergeant?

930
01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.860
I'm good, sir.

931
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.380
Okay, Eddie. Stay in the chair.

932
01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.340
Get it done, you two.

933
01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:01.740
Fuck you.

934
01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.420
Come on, Playboy.

935
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.380
Come on. Talk to me.

936
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.340
Oh, shit.

937
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.340
You got him?

938
01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.860
It's all radio chatter
about the JSOC asset.


939
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.500
Who?

940
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.180
The reason those guys are there,

941
01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.100
not confirmed,

942
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.220
but one says Borneo,
the other Yemen.


943
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.940
Yemen?

944
01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.820
That's halfway around the
fucking world. You shitting me?


945
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.740
Who's saying that?

946
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.060
Reading between the lines with CIA or DIA.

947
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.940
Man.

948
01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.500
Alphabet soup motherfuckers!

949
01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.220
You can't trust a word they say.

950
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.780
Hands!

951
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.500
Hands!

952
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:55.780
Hands!

953
01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.580
Are you injured?

954
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.340
Look at me.

955
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.140
I thought you were dead.

956
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:18.940
Here.

957
01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.380
Drink this. Drink. Drink. Drink.

958
01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.060
Here. Put that on, okay?

959
01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.180
Okay?

960
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.860
An RPG exploded on your position.

961
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.620
Near,

962
01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.100
not on.

963
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.860
Listen.

964
01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.980
Bishop got captured.

965
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.060
He's injured pretty bad.

966
01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.300
I gotta go.

967
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.460
We gotta go back and get him.

968
01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.220
So,

969
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.740
grab what you can, okay? Here.

970
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.060
Take this. Here.

971
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.980
Put them in here. 
Put them in here.

972
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.860
Here take this.

973
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.820
Come on.

974
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.580
You following me, Sergeant?

975
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.180
Hey. Look,

976
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.500
I get it.

977
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.420
This is not where you want to be,

978
01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.700
but you got to dig, okay?

979
01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.180
It's not here. It's not here. It's here.

980
01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.060
Bishop's in trouble.

981
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.500
We gotta go back and get him.

982
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.140
Okay.

983
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.860
You can still shoot, can't you?

984
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.700
Yeah.

985
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.060
Let's go.

986
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.180
Still have your battery?

987
01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.580
No, I lost it in the fall.

988
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.340
Let me see your knife.

989
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.380
What for?

990
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.700
I'm gonna call Warhawk.

991
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.220
With a water bottle?

992
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.820
Come on, you piece of shit.

993
01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.940
Reaper, this is Playboy

994
01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.820
Playboy, where the fuck are you?

995
01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.700
I'm with Alpha one.

996
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.060
We're headed back to the initial AO.

997
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.740
No, no, no, no. Negative.
Negative, Playboy.


998
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.420
We have Intel the asset has been found.

999
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.500
We're not going for the asset.

1000
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.220
Say again?

1001
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.700
We're not going for the asset. One of our team
members was captured. We're going in to get him.


1002
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.180
Playboy, a QRF is being assembled.
Hold your position until they're deployed.


1003
01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.620
Negative, Reaper. 
There's no time.

1004
01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.060
Get on the horn with CJSOTF,
and let them know our sitrep.


1005
01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.620
We're gonna need planes on
standby. ETA to target area is 6-0 mikes.


1006
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.020
We'll confirm grid then. Over.

1007
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.700
What direction you heading, Playboy?

1008
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.820
Give me your bearing.

1009
01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.420
Playboy?

1010
01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.500
Lost comms.

1011
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.340
Fuck!

1012
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.620
Connect me to CJSOTF.

1013
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.060
Well, I know it's unusual, Eileen.
Just fucking connect me, okay?


1014
01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:10.740
So where is he?

1015
01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.300
No idea.

1016
01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.740
What's the plan?

1017
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.580
Drop some bombs, create a diversion,

1018
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:19.860
go in and get him.

1019
01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.020
Kill anyone that gets in our way.

1020
01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.300
Where do you want the bombs?

1021
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.420
You're the JTAC. You tell me.

1022
01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.860
Probably the best place would be along
those cave entrances on this ridge line.


1023
01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.340
Space them out 15
minutes apart while we go in.


1024
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.060
Sound good?

1025
01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.340
Sounds good.

1026
01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.820
Find Bishop, make our
move when the first strike hits.


1027
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.140
Second strike should hold their attention.

1028
01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.340
And the last one?

1029
01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.620
Mass effect.

1030
01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.100
Let's turn those caves inside out.

1031
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.740
Fuckin' A, kid.

1032
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620
Fuckin' A.

1033
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.860
Yeah, I'm here. 
What do you got?

1034
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.300
B1 full payload? 
That will do the job.

1035
01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.380
I will confirm

1036
01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.300
the 9 line with
Bone 0-1 when received.


1037
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.500
Roger.

1038
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.380
B1 in the air, Colonel.

1039
01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.820
Copy that. Nice work.

1040
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.380
Reaper, this is Playboy.

1041
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.740
Copy, Playboy. I'm here.

1042
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.100
Okay. Game plan is to use CAS
to strike a set of cave structures


1043
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.140
to the north of the
compound as a diversion.


1044
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:36.940
I need three attacks spaced approx

1045
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.220
Eleven hundred. Mark that.

1046
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.660
First strike, 1100.

1047
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:43.060
Intent for first two attacks
is to hold their attention.


1048
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.620
Final attack should have enough ordnance
to neutralize all enemy in the caves.


1049
01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.380
Type three BOC.

1050
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.260
November, Victor, 1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5.

1051
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.060
Say again, Playboy. Say again.

1052
01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:01.020
November, Victor,

1053
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:01.860
Copy.

1054
01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.260
Eyes on you.

1055
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.180
Three strikes. Eleven hundred. Diversion.

1056
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.460
Eleven fifteen, diversion.

1057
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.060
Eleven thirty, we're gonna light
that shit up and blow it to fuck.


1058
01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:13.860
Confirm, Playboy.

1059
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.140
Oh, fuck.

1060
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.420
Battery's dead.

1061
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.500
We good?

1062
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.500
Hope so.

1063
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.980
Playboy, confirm?

1064
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.020
Lost comms.

1065
01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:30.780
Fuck.

1066
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.060
All right, we all know the plan.

1067
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.220
You both did some fine work
here today. Get out of here.


1068
01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.180
No, no, no, no, no.

1069
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.500
We are not going anywhere.

1070
01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.220
I wasn't asking. You're done.

1071
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.500
You're ten hours over
your eight-hour shift.


1072
01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.380
Okay, Reaper. Out of the chair.

1073
01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.100
Eat a bag of dicks, Hawkins.

1074
01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:47.820
Hawkins?

1075
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.820
It's Andrews.

1076
01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.260
Come on. Let me get you up.

1077
01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.620
No.

1078
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.340
Exit the chair, Reaper.

1079
01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.860
There's no fucking way I'm off this op.

1080
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.300
No fucking way.

1081
01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.860
I got one KIA.

1082
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:02.820
One MIA.

1083
01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.620
And I got two fucking nut jobs

1084
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.100
trying to take on an
entire Abu Sayyaf camp.


1085
01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.220
That leaves one team, i.e. us,

1086
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.820
to make sure this whole thing doesn't
go to hell in a fucking handbasket.


1087
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.820
You finished?

1088
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.820
I'm not finished.

1089
01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.180
I can keep going.

1090
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.180
Then I suggest you think very carefully about the
next words that come out of your mouth, Captain.


1091
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.380
Oh, come on, Virgil. You're
gonna pull rank on me?


1092
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.020
You told me I could have this chair

1093
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.700
until the op was done.

1094
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.580
Go and watch the basketball.

1095
01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.660
Sir, with all due respect, this is
Reaper's op. We should be allowed to--


1096
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.980
I don't recall asking your
opinion, Staff Sergeant.


1097
01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.100
Well, maybe that's your problem, Colonel.

1098
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:40.020
I would strongly advise you to
not go down the same rabbit hole


1099
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.340
as your partner here.

1100
01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.340
She did not say a word, Colonel.

1101
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.340
Not a single word.

1102
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.420
Exit the chair.

1103
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.380
Exit the room,

1104
01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.780
and I will do my best to forget
this conversation ever happened.


1105
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.620
Don't fuck it up, Junior.

1106
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.060
You got it.

1107
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.660
First strike 1100. 
It's just a diversion.

1108
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.260
Second strike 11--

1109
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.220
Captain!

1110
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.340
I'm good. I'm good.

1111
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.980
You're dismissed.

1112
01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.140
Here we are.

1113
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.820
Eyes.

1114
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.380
One guy in the tent.

1115
01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.420
Two guys on the balcony.

1116
01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.260
What's our time?

1117
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.020
Twenty.

1118
01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.620
This is gonna get ugly.

1119
01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.820
I need you focused. 
Head on a swivel.

1120
01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.700
If you see something I don't,

1121
01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.340
you say 'contact
left, contact right.'


1122
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.460
Somebody comes from behind us,

1123
01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.180
you say 'six.'

1124
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.620
I'll handle the rest.

1125
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.980
Only shoot if it's necessary. We got
to keep this quiet for as long as we can.


1126
01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:22.860
For what it's worth,

1127
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.820
you earned your tier one status today.

1128
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.940
Does that mean I get paid more?

1129
01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.860
Fuck no. It just sounds cooler.

1130
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:32.540
You ready?

1131
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.420
Nope.

1132
01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.340
You?

1133
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.580
Always.

1134
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.700
Let's do it.

1135
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.180
Okay.

1136
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.500
Fucker.

1137
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.300
You good?

1138
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.460
Yeah.

1139
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:04.380
Alright.

1140
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.380
He's jammed.

1141
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.460
Go, go, go, go!

1142
01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.420
Come on!

1143
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.420
Gun right. Right!

1144
01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.340
Move! Move!

1145
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:41.700
On me.

1146
01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.740
On you.

1147
01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.980
Contact left!

1148
01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.420
Drop down!

1149
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.380
You good?

1150
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.700
Fuck!

1151
01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:45.980
Fuck.

1152
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.980
Oh, fuck!

1153
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:05.940
Grenade!

1154
01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.180
Get down!

1155
01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.540
Hey, Sug.

1156
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.700
Bishop.

1157
01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:44.180
This your idea of a rescue mission?

1158
01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:49.420
I think I got them
right where I want 'em.

1159
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.380
You look like ass.

1160
01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.260
Hey,

1161
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.300
how you doing, Bishop?

1162
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.980
Talk to me.

1163
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.260
Ah...

1164
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.980
Air Force,

1165
01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:17.340
I think

1166
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.380
we're in a bad spot.

1167
01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.180
Yeah, we're in a bad spot.

1168
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.300
Hey!

1169
01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.180
Hey!

1170
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.180
Hey, yo!

1171
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.580
Hey, listen to me, man.

1172
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.460
They're gonna drop bombs on
these caves. You understand?


1173
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.060
Bombs on these caves.

1174
01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.700
If we don't get out of
here, we're all gonna die.


1175
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.220
You understand?
Bombs on these caves.


1176
01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:50.940
Fuck!

1177
01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.500
Stupid fucks!

1178
01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.420
Stupid fucks!

1179
01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:02.860
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn

1180
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.660
Be advised ETA to first drone strike,

1181
01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.300
two mikes.

1182
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.020
All right, let's fucking rock and roll.

1183
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.780
Zoom out 400 meters.

1184
01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.060
I think they know

1185
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.300
I'm not gonna last much longer.

1186
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.820
Just-- just-- just hang on
a second, all right, man?


1187
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.580
I'm gonna figure out
how to get us out of here.


1188
01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.980
I'm already out.

1189
01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:44.420
Just get Bishop and get
yourselves out of here.


1190
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.100
Okay?

1191
01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.700
Nah, you're good, man.
You're good, you're good.


1192
01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:49.780
Don't...

1193
01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:52.660
fucking touch him!

1194
01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.180
Or I'll fucking fucking fuck!

1195
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.180
Fuck!

1196
01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.820
Fucking pieces of shit!

1197
01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.620
Come on!

1198
01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.500
Get your fucking hands off him!

1199
01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.460
Fucking coward.

1200
01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.860
Sugar?

1201
01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.140
Get your fucking hands off him!

1202
01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.260
Hashimi,

1203
01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.060
you like that?

1204
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.420
Sugar?

1205
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.540
Oh, fuck.

1206
01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.020
Sugar?

1207
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.140
I'm good.

1208
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.660
Fuck!

1209
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.580
Fuck!

1210
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.700
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1211
01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:58.100
Go.

1212
01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.820
You know Japan invaded these lands in 1941.

1213
01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.660
Hm. Built these caves
with the intent to stay


1214
01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:33.140
but our Moro brothers
defeated them very quickly. Hm.


1215
01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.860
You know this dam they built...

1216
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.660
it was a very forward step.

1217
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.700
Was it this blood

1218
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.140
washed from the land

1219
01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.340
and into our mouths?

1220
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.860
But not to me.

1221
01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.300
We answer to no one but ourselves.

1222
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:27.460
We were having a fairly pleasant day.

1223
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.460
Blessed by the...

1224
01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.700
Then, how you say?

1225
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.540
Someone rains on our parade?

1226
01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.820
Removed one imperialist...

1227
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.540
just to find another.

1228
01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.140
This is not the conversation
we should be having right now.


1229
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.540
No?

1230
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.620
What should we talk about?

1231
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.300
I told you.

1232
01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.660
There's more bombs on the way.

1233
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:01.860
Ah,

1234
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.500
I'm not interested in your faceless bombs.

1235
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.180
You see, real results

1236
01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.860
are created face-to-face,

1237
01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.540
interactions like

1238
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:17.180
what you and I are doing right here.

1239
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:14.580
Speak!

1240
01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.260
Where are the other commandos located?

1241
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:18.060
There's no more. It's just us!

1242
01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.180
Your jets are still in the area.

1243
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.700
Someone must be
communicating with them.


1244
01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:35.340
We were communicating with them.

1245
01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:36.220
Listen,

1246
01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.980
there's more strikes on the way.

1247
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.500
If we don't get out of
here, we're all fucking dust.


1248
01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:43.020
No! You are dust!

1249
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.060
Fucking dust!

1250
01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.860
How does this feel?

1251
01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.860
To be this scared.

1252
01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.500
Too weak to do anything
about your own death.


1253
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.380
You may think that I do this

1254
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.660
without feeling anything.

1255
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.660
That is wrong.

1256
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.180
To kill affects me.

1257
01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:25.780
To embrace the
brutality of this affects me.


1258
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.940
And that is the difference
between you and I.


1259
01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.820
I look a man in the eye,

1260
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.860
and I make my choice intimate.

1261
01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.340
The bomb!

1262
01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.340
Excuse me?

1263
01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:53.460
Sir?

1264
01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.020
I got this thing
here I don't even know--

1265
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.300
I don't even know if this
is something that exists.


1266
01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.380
My wife's written it down, so
she might have got it wrong.


1267
01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.300
It sounds a little crazy,

1268
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.020
but, uh,

1269
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.180
I gotta ask, you know?

1270
01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:08.860
Do you have

1271
01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.180
artisanal tree nut fermented
plant-based cashew


1272
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.860
and tahini smoked vegan
new cheese.


1273
01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:17.700
Is that a thing?

1274
01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.620
Yeah,

1275
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:19.980
right here.

1276
01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.500
Man after my own heart.

1277
01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.420
Huh. I would have bet money
against that. Thank you very much.


1278
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.340
All right, let's fucking rock and roll.

1279
01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.180
Zoom out 400 meters.

1280
01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:33.740
It's fucking showtime.

1281
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.340
Ready to fire.

1282
01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.380
Bombs away.

1283
01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:03.860
Six, five, four, three,

1284
01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.820
two, one.

1285
01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.140
Impact

1286
01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.100
Holy shit.

1287
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.260
You JSOC?

1288
01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.260
Can you walk?

1289
01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:58.980
Who are you?

1290
01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:00.660
Who are you?

1291
01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.380
Hey!

1292
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.060
Fuck!

1293
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.780
Fucking hell, Kinney.

1294
01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:18.980
You good?

1295
01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:20.020
Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.860
Who the fuck's that guy?

1297
01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.460
The asset...

1298
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.300
I think.

1299
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.340
Come on. We gotta move.

1300
01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:32.180
So soon?

1301
01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:32.660
Let's go.

1302
01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.060
Which way?

1303
01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.700
I think it's this way. 
Let's keep moving.

1304
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:52.100
Fuck.

1305
01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:54.300
Yeah.

1306
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.060
Okay.

1307
01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:58.260
All right.

1308
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:00.180
Sit here for a second. 
I'll be right back.

1309
01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:05.020
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn 0-6.
You are inbound to target. Five mikes.


1310
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:10.860
Copy incoming. We're hot. Let me
know when I can cross extend at 7-9-8-4-0.


1311
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.700
Fuck,

1312
01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.660
fuck, fuck, fuck.

1313
01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:24.700
Come on.

1314
01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.060
Fuck.

1315
01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.420
Barbeque creepy peanuts.

1316
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.740
Yeah!

1317
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:37.620
Come on!

1318
01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:39.340
Vegan sour cream.

1319
01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.220
Come on! Yeah!

1320
01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.060
Plant based feta.

1321
01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.060
Oh, you motherfucker!

1322
01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.420
Fuck.

1323
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.980
Come on, man.

1324
01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.660
Come on. Pick up the fucking phone.

1325
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.580
Get the phone, Sergeant.

1326
01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:13.060
Sergeant!

1327
01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:17.780
Yes, sir.

1328
01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.300
Reaper. I need Reaper.

1329
01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:20.340
Reaper's gone.

1330
01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:21.220
Try his cell--

1331
01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.260
Wait, wait. Hold on.

1332
01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.980
702-166-42… 00.

1333
01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.860
Yeah! Come on!

1334
01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:31.500
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

1335
01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.620
Hello?

1336
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.060
Fuck!

1337
01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.940
6-42 00.

1338
01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.340
Come on, man.

1339
01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:48.500
Pick up the phone.

1340
01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.260
I'm looking. I'm looking at
all of the shelves. All right.


1341
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.060
Hey,

1342
01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:53.820
hold on.

1343
01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.420
No, I'm looking at...

1344
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.260
It was a number I didn't know.

1345
01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:02.340
I'm looking at all the shelves,

1346
01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.980
but they got real Mexican, you know?

1347
01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.740
Cou-- but with meat in it.

1348
01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:09.820
No, I'm not...

1349
01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:11.940
Baby, okay.

1350
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:12.780
All right? It's got meat in it.

1351
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.100
Sorry I shouldn't have
used the word real.


1352
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:21.140
Sunburn 0-6, this is Boeing

1353
01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.500
Come on. Move! Move!

1354
01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:25.140
Okay?

1355
01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.460
...tampon because

1356
01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.540
I wanted to buy a degradable,

1357
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.740
No problem. Just go right ahead.

1358
01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:34.740
Just...

1359
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:36.740
what's your problem?

1360
01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.580
Nothing.

1361
01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:39.220
Okay.

1362
01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:43.140
People is so aggressive...

1363
01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:48.380
Reaper, it's Playboy.
Abort. I need you to abort.


1364
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.780
Abort the last strike. I
need you to abort the last--!


1365
01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.580
Fuck!

1366
01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:56.660
Call SitComm.

1367
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.660
I don't understand.

1368
01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.140
Call SitComm, for fuck's sake.

1369
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.500
Calling SitComm.

1370
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.220
Yes!

1371
01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.020
Come on!

1372
01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.340
Yeah!

1373
01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:10.740
Come on, motherfuckers. 
Answer the phone.

1374
01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:12.860
Lining up for the final run.

1375
01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.020
Come on. Call SitComm.

1376
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.100
Come on! Come on!

1377
01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:26.140
Motherfucker,

1378
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.580
answer the fucking phone.

1379
01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.540
Come on!

1380
01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.860
Come on!

1381
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:38.500
Oh, fuck it.

1382
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.500
Fuck it!

1383
01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.460
Load 0-1 on final approach.

1384
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:52.100
Come on.

1385
01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.100
Move! Move!

1386
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.060
Right there.

1387
01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.500
Time to target

1388
01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:06.500
30 seconds.

1389
01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:16.460
Guys!

1390
01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.260
Come on, move!

1391
01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.140
What the...

1392
01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.220
Impact 15 seconds.

1393
01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:28.580
Abort the strike!

1394
01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:31.020
We have payload. Ten seconds.

1395
01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.380
Seven...six...five...

1396
01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.620
three, two, one...

1397
01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:50.460
Boeing 0-1, abort!
Boeing 0-1, abort!


1398
01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460
Do you copy?

1399
01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.060
What are you doing?

1400
01:41:59.100 --> 01:41:59.700
They copy?

1401
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.060
Yeah.

1402
01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.580
The operator

1403
01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.060
is still in the target area.

1404
01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:03.940
Bullshit.

1405
01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:05.020
Zoom in.

1406
01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:05.500
Zoom in

1407
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620
to the caves

1408
01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.300
where the strike was gonna be

1409
01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.660
There he is. That's him. 
That's Playboy.

1410
01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.980
Sorry, man.

1411
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:16.180
Goddamn, Reaper.

1412
01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:34.540
Who...

1413
01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.180
are you waving at?

1414
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:38.980
A friend.

1415
01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:00.660
Fuck!

1416
01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.780
Who won the game?

1417
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.700
Vols, baby.

1418
01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.300
Elite eight.

1419
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:27.820
That's wonderful, Colonel,

1420
01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:29.140
congratulations.

1421
01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.380
It's an excellent win for you

1422
01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.140
and the great
state of Tennessee.


1423
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.580
That's right.

1424
01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.300
I just called that phone

1425
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.180
five fucking times.

1426
01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.380
Ringer's off again.

1427
01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.740
Now it wasn't my pregnant wife.

1428
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:53.980
But it was a life-or-death situation
for a JTAC operator in the field.


1429
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.460
Our job is communication!

1430
01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.300
Our priority is protecting
the men and women


1431
01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.300
who serve this country.

1432
01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:07.100
So if you don't mind,

1433
01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.060
can we get back on
with the fucking job?


1434
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.980
Hell you think you're doing?

1435
01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.180
You can take that out of my
active-duty bonuses, Colonel.


1436
01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.460
Hey, get some sleep.

1437
01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:11.660
See you in the morning.

1438
01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:12.740
See you then.

1439
01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:15.780
Uh...

1440
01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:18.060
you don't own a tux, do you?

1441
01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300
A tux?

1442
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.460
I do not own a tux, no.

1443
01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.460
Okay.

1444
01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.340
Wedding is not black tie, right?

1445
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.740
No, not black tie.

1446
01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.420
The wedding party is.

1447
01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:32.940
Are you gonna ask
me to be a bridesmaid?

1448
01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.380
No, Reaper.

1449
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:40.140
I was gonna ask if you want
to walk me down the aisle.


1450
01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:44.700
You serious?

1451
01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.180
Yeah.

1452
01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.100
Wow.

1453
01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.380
That would be one of the
greatest privileges


1454
01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.420
of my life.

1455
01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.740
You know one thing I know...

1456
01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:03.500
one hundred percent for sure.

1457
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:05.820
Your dad

1458
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:07.740
would be so proud of you.

1459
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.180
Thank you.

1460
01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.620
So, what are we
going to dance to?


1461
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.540
Dance?

1462
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.060
Yeah.

1463
01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:17.780
Oh, no, I have not
thought about that yet.


1464
01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.660
Okay. Well, you got to pick a song

1465
01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.340
and then just listen to my hands.

1466
01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:24.540
I'm gonna listen to your hands?

1467
01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.500
Oh, yeah. Yes, you are.

1468
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.100
Oh, okay.

1469
01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.660
Whoa, okay.

1470
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.020
Run this round my back.

1471
01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:30.340
This?

1472
01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.380
- That way, I know where it's coming.
- That's right. There you go.


1473
01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:32.820
Okay, what's next?

1474
01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.460
Come back in and out.

1475
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:35.460
Out.

1476
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.300
And back to me.

1477
01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:36.860
Okay.

1478
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:37.340
Yeah.

1479
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.020
And then out.

1480
01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:38.620
Out.

1481
01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.820
This time around.

1482
01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:41.140
Give me the other hand.

1483
01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:41.700
Oh okay.

1484
01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:43.660
Walking over. Oh, around.

1485
01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.740
Around my back.

1486
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:46.820
Beautiful.

1487
01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.540
You have done this
many, many times before.


1488
01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.100
I've had a few Dosey Does.

1489
01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.940
Oh, you're pretty good. 
You're pretty good.

1490
01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.420
Any other dances. 
You know how to twerk?

1491
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.580
To who? To twerk?

1492
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.580
To twerk.

1493
01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:01.340
- Uh, no. I don't know how to twerk.
- You better get practicing. Yeah.
