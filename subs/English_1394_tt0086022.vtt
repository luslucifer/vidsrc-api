1
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.060
Thank God, we arrived.

2
00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.375
Speak Italian.

3
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.378
Sorry. We've arrived.

4
00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:55.631
I stopped far away
so we could go for a walk.


5
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.720
It's a marvelous painting.

6
00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:05.641
I cried the first time I saw it.

7
00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:14.192
This light reminds me of the autumn
in Moscow in Neskuchny Garden.


8
00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:20.948
- Come on.
- I don't want to.


9
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.035
I'll go ahead and wait for you inside.

10
00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:26.621
I don't want to.
I already told you.


11
00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:35.838
I am fed up with all your beauties.

12
00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:42.845
I don't want to take it alone anymore.
All this beauty of yours...


13
00:04:49.603 --> 00:04:52.105
I can't take it anymore.
That's it.


14
00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:21.944
Do you want a baby too?

15
00:06:22.738 --> 00:06:25.448
Or are you asking God to spare you?

16
00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:27.950
I'm here just to have a look.

17
00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:35.416
Unfortunately,
if there are any casual onlookers


18
00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.377
who aren't supplicants,

19
00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:41.881
then nothing happens.

20
00:06:43.884 --> 00:06:45.927
What is supposed to happen?

21
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.932
Whatever you like,
whatever you need most.


22
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:57.897
But you should
at least kneel down.


23
00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:26.425
- I can't.
- Look at them.


24
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.427
They're used to it.

25
00:07:28.512 --> 00:07:31.264
- They have faith.
- Probably.


26
00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:10.613
Can I ask you something?

27
00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:16.994
Why do you think...

28
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:23.459
it's only the women
who pray so much?


29
00:09:25.754 --> 00:09:30.508
- You're asking me?
- You see so many women here.


30
00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:34.303
I'm only the sacristan.
I don't know these things.


31
00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:40.309
But you must wonder
why women are more devout than men.


32
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.854
You should know better than I.

33
00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:46.023
Because I'm a woman?

34
00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:49.777
No, I've never understood
these things.


35
00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:55.699
I'm a simple man.

36
00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:59.829
But I think...

37
00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:04.959
a woman is meant
to have children...


38
00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:08.087
to raise them...

39
00:10:09.798 --> 00:10:11.382
with patience...

40
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.969
and self-sacrifice.

41
00:10:15.053 --> 00:10:17.930
That's all she's meant for?

42
00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:23.018
- I don't know.
- Thank you.


43
00:10:23.353 --> 00:10:25.396
You've been a great help.

44
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:30.359
You asked what I thought.

45
00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:38.409
I know... you want to be happy.

46
00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:41.829
There are more important things.

47
00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:46.834
Wait.

48
00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:16.739
Mother of all mothers,
who knows the pain of being a mother.


49
00:11:16.823 --> 00:11:20.534
Mother of all mothers,
who knows the joy of being a mother.


50
00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:24.413
Mother of all children,
who knows the joy of having a child.


51
00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:28.250
Mother of all children,
who knows the pain of not having a child.


52
00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:32.880
Mother who understands all,
help your daughter to become a mother.


53
00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:19.713
I just don't understand you.

54
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:24.218
You go on and on
about the Madonna of Childbirth.


55
00:14:26.388 --> 00:14:31.266
We drove halfway
across Italy in the fog.


56
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.190
And you didn't even
go in there to see her.


57
00:15:04.718 --> 00:15:06.760
What are you reading?

58
00:15:07.637 --> 00:15:12.391
Arseny Tarkovsky's poems.

59
00:15:12.475 --> 00:15:16.186
- In Russian?
- No, it's a translation.


60
00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:18.856
Quite a good one.

61
00:15:19.232 --> 00:15:22.818
- Throw it away.
- Why?


62
00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:27.406
The translator's
a Very good poet.


63
00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:33.036
Poetry is untranslatable,
like the whole of art.


64
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.127
You may be right
that poetry is untranslatable.


65
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:45.841
But music?
Music for example...


66
00:15:52.432 --> 00:15:55.350
What is it?
What do you mean?


67
00:15:57.228 --> 00:15:59.438
It's a Russian song.

68
00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:07.404
You're right, but how could
we have got to know Tolstoy, Pushkin...


69
00:16:09.532 --> 00:16:12.034
and so understand Russia?

70
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.544
You don't understand
anything about Russia.


71
00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:27.090
Nor you Italy then.

72
00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:33.055
If Dante, Petrarch
and Machiavelli are useless.


73
00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.684
Sure.
It's impossible for us poor devils.


74
00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:42.022
How can we get
to know each other?


75
00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:45.567
By abolishing the frontiers.

76
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.528
Which?

77
00:16:50.323 --> 00:16:52.074
Between states.

78
00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:26.149
Good morning.

79
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:38.453
You know a maid in Milan
set fire to the house?


80
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.125
- Which house?
- Her employers' house.


81
00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:46.086
- Why?
- She was homesick.


82
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.630
She missed her home
and family down South.


83
00:17:49.007 --> 00:17:52.634
So she burned the thing
that stopped her going back.


84
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.516
Why did your musician, Sosnovsky,

85
00:18:00.935 --> 00:18:04.813
go back to Russia
if he knew he'd be a slave again?


86
00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:15.490
Why won't you confide in me?
I don't understand.


87
00:18:26.336 --> 00:18:30.255
Read this.
You'll understand.


88
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.840
What is it?

89
00:18:33.384 --> 00:18:36.303
The letter from
the Bologna Conservatory?


90
00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:41.892
I wanted to ask you,

91
00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:46.146
was Sosnovsky successful
when he returned to Russia?


92
00:18:47.398 --> 00:18:48.982
Was he happy?

93
00:18:52.403 --> 00:18:57.366
He started drinking and then...

94
00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:04.957
- He committed suicide?
- Exactly.


95
00:19:13.383 --> 00:19:17.886
Here I am!
I'm sorry, l was asleep.


96
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:21.014
- Do you have any identification?
- Yes.


97
00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.894
Here it is.

98
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:28.772
I'll go and get the keys.

99
00:19:31.943 --> 00:19:34.945
Those aren't
the other hotel keys, I hope?


100
00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:37.781
No, they're to my house.

101
00:19:51.754 --> 00:19:53.422
Here's your key.

102
00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:55.966
This way. Please.

103
00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:12.190
It's our best room.

104
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.819
Good night, Andrei.

105
00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:19.781
Come with me.
Your room is upstairs.


106
00:20:20.324 --> 00:20:22.159
It's nice here.

107
00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:26.705
It's still night,
but the countryside's pretty too.


108
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:28.790
There's the river,
the mushrooms.


109
00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:36.131
People keep coming back,
they often fall in love here.


110
00:20:37.425 --> 00:20:41.595
- You and your boyfriend will like it.
- He's not my boyfriend.


111
00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:45.390
Go on, he's sad
because he's in love.


112
00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:47.517
No, I think his mind's
on other things.


113
00:23:32.016 --> 00:23:36.686
THE HOLY BIBLE

114
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.218
- Did you knock?
- I hadn't yet.


115
00:24:26.487 --> 00:24:28.530
Shall I ask to call Moscow?

116
00:24:32.535 --> 00:24:34.995
You haven't talked
to your wife for two days.


117
00:24:38.499 --> 00:24:40.000
No, thanks.

118
00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:20.415
One, two, three. Go!

119
00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:55.309
Andrei.

120
00:32:10.492 --> 00:32:14.454
Andrei, get up!
We'll be eating in half an hour.


121
00:32:14.913 --> 00:32:18.207
I'll be downstairs.
It's lovely here.


122
00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:22.378
- St. Catherine used to come too.
- I'm coming.


123
00:32:26.133 --> 00:32:29.719
Excuse me, Miss.
What does this Russian do?


124
00:32:29.803 --> 00:32:32.638
- He's a poet.
- Is he writing about Italy?


125
00:32:32.723 --> 00:32:35.224
He's writing the biography
of a Russian musician.


126
00:32:35.309 --> 00:32:37.894
- Zoe!
- And how come he is here?


127
00:32:37.978 --> 00:32:42.899
This musician studied in Bologna
and came to these baths.


128
00:32:43.442 --> 00:32:46.527
- When?
- At the end of the 1,700s.


129
00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:51.699
- Was it Tchaikovsky?
- No, his name was Sosnovsky.


130
00:32:51.784 --> 00:32:54.410
- Wait.
- Didn't he marry a local woman?


131
00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:59.832
No, he was in love
with a Russian slave and died for her.


132
00:33:00.334 --> 00:33:02.043
What's the hurry?

133
00:33:07.257 --> 00:33:11.010
- Does your poet like Italy?
- Too much so.


134
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.554
But... I don't know.

135
00:33:14.932 --> 00:33:19.227
General, what's this strange music
we keep hearing day in and day out?


136
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.980
Wonderful music.
Beats Verdi anytime.


137
00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:26.859
Hands off Verdi.
This is Chinese stuff.


138
00:33:26.944 --> 00:33:30.154
A different civilization
with no sentimental wails.


139
00:33:30.239 --> 00:33:32.573
Voice of God, of nature.

140
00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:35.493
Pretend they're not there.

141
00:33:36.662 --> 00:33:38.913
Just go on your way.

142
00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:44.585
It's gotten into my mouth.
Move slowly.


143
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.755
- What does it taste like?
- It's a liquid sulfur.


144
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.093
- So it's good for the skin.
- Disgusting!


145
00:33:53.846 --> 00:33:56.848
I'm fine.
I'm falling asleep.


146
00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:01.936
In the '60s a drowned body
was found here.


147
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.189
Don't talk about it,
otherwise l get scared.


148
00:34:05.274 --> 00:34:08.067
In the war I've seen
thousands of dead soldiers.


149
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:11.028
Now listen,
it's never too late to learn


150
00:34:12.823 --> 00:34:17.201
whatever happens,
don't interfere.


151
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:24.125
Have you heard their talk,
what they're interested in?


152
00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:28.337
You've got to be different.

153
00:34:39.057 --> 00:34:41.601
You know why they're
in the water?


154
00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:46.981
They want to live forever.

155
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:52.445
Look who's here!

156
00:34:57.951 --> 00:34:59.452
Look at them!

157
00:35:15.093 --> 00:35:18.721
My cigar's gone out.
Hand me the lighter, please?


158
00:35:19.014 --> 00:35:20.264
General!

159
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:22.141
Why do they make fun of him?

160
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:26.604
A few years ago, he shut himself up
in the house with his family


161
00:35:26.688 --> 00:35:28.564
to wait for the end of the world.

162
00:35:28.649 --> 00:35:31.108
They stayed in for seven years.

163
00:35:31.193 --> 00:35:34.028
A religious fit, they say.

164
00:35:34.112 --> 00:35:36.489
Nonsense.
It was jealousy.


165
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.867
He was always jealous of his wife.

166
00:35:39.952 --> 00:35:43.287
Later she ran off
with the children to Genoa.


167
00:35:43.372 --> 00:35:47.750
Jealous my foot, he's nuts.

168
00:35:48.293 --> 00:35:50.086
It's obvious.

169
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.549
That's not it,
he was just scared.


170
00:35:56.134 --> 00:36:01.222
- Scared of what?
- Everything.


171
00:36:02.182 --> 00:36:06.143
You're wrong,
he's a man of great faith.


172
00:36:06.228 --> 00:36:10.481
And how, he kept his family
locked up for seven years.


173
00:36:11.316 --> 00:36:14.568
I was there
when they broke down the door.


174
00:36:15.028 --> 00:36:19.156
His kid shot out like a rat
and he chased after him.


175
00:36:19.241 --> 00:36:23.160
We thought he wanted to kill him.
What faith!


176
00:36:23.578 --> 00:36:26.372
Here's the Russian poet.

177
00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:06.245
Miss, I don't smoke,
but could l have a cigarette?


178
00:37:07.247 --> 00:37:09.248
Of course,
as you don't smoke.


179
00:37:23.722 --> 00:37:26.557
- It's gone out.
- So it has.


180
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.734
Thank you.

181
00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:57.421
Never forget what he said to her.

182
00:37:58.507 --> 00:38:00.007
He who?

183
00:38:01.093 --> 00:38:02.593
And her?

184
00:38:05.055 --> 00:38:07.431
Saint Catherine!

185
00:38:33.125 --> 00:38:36.710
So what did God say
to St. Catherine?


186
00:38:42.134 --> 00:38:45.594
"You are she who is not,

187
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:50.516
but I am he who is."

188
00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:54.019
Did you hear that?

189
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.064
Bravo, Domenico!

190
00:39:02.779 --> 00:39:06.699
Did he speak
to St. Catherine himself?


191
00:39:07.242 --> 00:39:09.743
Be careful.
He's not stupid.


192
00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:13.831
Of course not.
Domenico has a degree.


193
00:39:13.915 --> 00:39:14.957
In what?

194
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:17.710
I don't understand "Faith."
What is it?


195
00:39:17.794 --> 00:39:20.713
Your Italian isn't so good, uh?

196
00:39:21.965 --> 00:39:24.008
It was better
when you first came.


197
00:39:24.092 --> 00:39:26.719
What does "faith" mean?

198
00:39:27.345 --> 00:39:30.055
In Russian it's "vera."

199
00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:37.646
Why do they say he's mad?

200
00:39:37.731 --> 00:39:40.858
He's not mad.
He has faith.


201
00:39:41.526 --> 00:39:44.111
There are lots of these lunatics
at large in Italy.


202
00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:48.908
Asylums have been closed down
but the families won't have them.


203
00:39:48.992 --> 00:39:51.619
And many must withdraw from others.

204
00:39:52.913 --> 00:39:55.039
We don't know what madness is.

205
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.586
They're troublesome,
inconvenient


206
00:40:03.215 --> 00:40:05.925
we refuse to understand them.

207
00:40:07.135 --> 00:40:08.969
They're alone.

208
00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:15.976
But they're certainly
closer to the truth.


209
00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:19.772
He has another fixation now.

210
00:40:21.107 --> 00:40:22.399
What?

211
00:40:22.484 --> 00:40:27.988
He gets into the pool with
a lighted candle. Nobody knows why.


212
00:40:28.698 --> 00:40:31.283
Everyone's afraid he wants
to drown himself


213
00:40:31.368 --> 00:40:35.037
so they throw him out
and save him.


214
00:40:35.497 --> 00:40:36.997
I don't believe it.

215
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.707
Ask them.

216
00:40:40.043 --> 00:40:44.797
Can we ask him
to have lunch with us?


217
00:40:44.881 --> 00:40:47.258
- When?
- Now.


218
00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:49.468
Now, you don't know
what time it is.


219
00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:52.137
- What time is it?
- It's 7:00 in the morning.


220
00:40:52.597 --> 00:40:54.098
In the morning?

221
00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.812
Does that man
with the wet shoes come often?


222
00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.105
- Who? Domenico?
- Yes.


223
00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:02.564
So this is what it's all about.

224
00:41:02.649 --> 00:41:05.025
It depends. Sometimes he does,
sometimes he doesn't.


225
00:41:09.072 --> 00:41:12.324
- Where does he live?
- Up above Bagno Vignoni.


226
00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:15.244
In the square,
near the church.


227
00:41:16.955 --> 00:41:18.706
What's so funny?

228
00:41:21.126 --> 00:41:22.543
Andrei!

229
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.051
- Stop.
- Why?


230
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.516
You're prettier...

231
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.311
in this light.

232
00:41:40.395 --> 00:41:41.687
Redhead, redhead.

233
00:41:41.771 --> 00:41:43.272
You think so?

234
00:41:56.411 --> 00:42:00.080
I'm beginning to understand.

235
00:42:03.668 --> 00:42:05.002
What?

236
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:12.259
Why do you think he locked up
his family for seven years?


237
00:42:21.144 --> 00:42:22.978
How should I know?

238
00:42:44.084 --> 00:42:46.001
There he is.

239
00:42:48.129 --> 00:42:50.506
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.


240
00:42:50.757 --> 00:42:52.424
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


241
00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:08.565
Good morning.

242
00:43:11.986 --> 00:43:15.114
I've brought a famous
Russian writer.


243
00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:22.079
My life is normal,
there's nothing interesting about it.


244
00:43:22.831 --> 00:43:26.875
It's true, but we hear
you had a lovely experience.


245
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.254
I read about it too,
in the papers.


246
00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:33.173
Tell him about it.

247
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.676
It's not worth it.

248
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:46.603
Maybe not, but this gentleman
has come from Moscow.


249
00:43:47.021 --> 00:43:48.522
For me?

250
00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:52.734
He's come a long way.

251
00:44:06.708 --> 00:44:09.293
- What did he say?
- He doesn't feel like talking.


252
00:44:09.377 --> 00:44:11.753
- Let's go.
- What?


253
00:44:11.838 --> 00:44:14.715
Try again,
it's very important.


254
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.851
Excuse me?

255
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.732
- Stop for a minute.
- Go!


256
00:44:32.275 --> 00:44:34.026
Look at that!

257
00:44:39.782 --> 00:44:41.658
Where are you going?
What's wrong?


258
00:44:42.076 --> 00:44:43.577
Have you offended him?

259
00:44:45.038 --> 00:44:47.247
You've offended me!

260
00:44:47.665 --> 00:44:51.585
He's crazy.
It's not up to me whether he talks or not.


261
00:44:51.878 --> 00:44:53.837
I'm sorry, but I'm going.

262
00:44:54.255 --> 00:44:56.465
If you care so much, try.

263
00:44:56.841 --> 00:44:58.550
You know a bit of Italian.

264
00:44:58.635 --> 00:45:02.596
If you don't like the way I work,
say so.


265
00:45:03.431 --> 00:45:06.183
But believe me,
not only am I a good translator,


266
00:45:06.267 --> 00:45:09.102
but I even improve
on the original.


267
00:45:10.605 --> 00:45:14.107
I'm going back to Rome.
Our trip's over.


268
00:45:17.737 --> 00:45:19.112
All right.

269
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:56.525
Excuse me.

270
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.780
I think I know why you do that.

271
00:46:03.616 --> 00:46:04.950
What?

272
00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:07.160
The bicycle?

273
00:46:09.163 --> 00:46:12.499
Before, with your family.

274
00:46:20.675 --> 00:46:22.426
I'm tired.

275
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.619
Where are you?

276
00:48:13.246 --> 00:48:14.746
Come in!

277
00:50:38.015 --> 00:50:41.434
Did you hear that?
It's Beethoven.


278
00:51:32.987 --> 00:51:37.157
One drop plus one drop

279
00:51:37.408 --> 00:51:40.160
makes a bigger drop, not two.

280
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:50.587
- May I?
- Smoke.


281
00:51:52.006 --> 00:51:56.509
When I don't know what to say
I ask for a cigarette too.


282
00:51:58.137 --> 00:52:00.305
But I never learned to smoke.

283
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:02.891
It's too hard.

284
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.192
You have to learn to not smoke,

285
00:52:12.693 --> 00:52:14.903
to do important things.

286
00:52:14.987 --> 00:52:16.363
Such as?

287
00:54:40.758 --> 00:54:42.425
Some wine?

288
00:56:29.116 --> 00:56:32.869
We need bigger ideas.

289
00:56:33.287 --> 00:56:34.621
What?

290
00:56:50.054 --> 00:56:52.305
I was selfish before.

291
00:56:54.266 --> 00:56:56.434
I wanted to save my family.

292
00:56:58.145 --> 00:57:02.273
Everyone must be saved,
the whole world.


293
00:57:02.358 --> 00:57:03.691
How?

294
00:57:05.194 --> 00:57:06.694
It's simple.

295
00:57:11.659 --> 00:57:13.284
You see the candle?

296
00:57:14.328 --> 00:57:15.703
All right.

297
00:57:16.705 --> 00:57:18.414
Why do you say "all right"?

298
00:57:18.999 --> 00:57:20.333
Wait...

299
00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:24.295
You're confusing me.

300
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:34.681
You need to cross the water
with the lighted candle.


301
00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:38.851
- Which water?
- The hot water.


302
00:57:40.396 --> 00:57:45.233
St. Catherine's pool,
by the hotel,


303
00:57:46.694 --> 00:57:48.444
the steaming water.

304
00:57:49.196 --> 00:57:51.281
All right, when?

305
00:57:52.032 --> 00:57:53.366
Now...

306
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.288
I can't do it.

307
00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:02.000
I don't want...

308
00:58:04.044 --> 00:58:06.129
When I light the candle

309
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:09.424
and get into the water,

310
00:58:10.843 --> 00:58:12.760
they pull me out.

311
00:58:14.847 --> 00:58:16.597
They kick me out.

312
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.979
And they shout,
"You're crazy!"


313
00:58:25.357 --> 00:58:26.858
Get it?

314
00:58:37.703 --> 00:58:40.246
- All right.
- All right?


315
00:58:43.083 --> 00:58:44.625
It's all wrong!

316
00:59:12.654 --> 00:59:14.155
Help me.

317
00:59:16.533 --> 00:59:20.119
- Help me.
- All right, but...


318
00:59:21.997 --> 00:59:23.498
Of course.

319
00:59:40.766 --> 00:59:43.476
Where's the Russian
who's going to Bagno Vignoni?


320
00:59:44.978 --> 00:59:46.479
The taxi's here.

321
01:00:23.183 --> 01:00:24.684
It's late.

322
01:00:26.937 --> 01:00:28.438
I must go.

323
01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:34.402
Thank you.

324
01:01:00.554 --> 01:01:03.306
Why me, of all people?

325
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:14.650
- You've children?
- Two, a girl and a boy.


326
01:01:16.445 --> 01:01:18.905
And your wife?
Is she pretty?


327
01:01:21.575 --> 01:01:23.784
You know the Madonna
of Childbirth?


328
01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:25.953
By Piero della Francesca.

329
01:01:26.038 --> 01:01:28.372
She's like that but all black.

330
01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:33.753
Go with the candle.

331
01:01:35.255 --> 01:01:40.551
We're planning
something big in Rome.


332
01:01:48.852 --> 01:01:50.061
Zoe!

333
01:01:53.148 --> 01:01:54.649
Where are you?

334
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:58.569
Zoe, answer me!

335
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:06.285
Zoe, you know I'm scared
of being alone.


336
01:02:07.287 --> 01:02:11.374
I know what you're thinking,
but that's enough now.


337
01:02:11.959 --> 01:02:15.086
It's wrong to keep thinking
the same thing.


338
01:03:32.372 --> 01:03:33.873
What do you want?

339
01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:32.098
Dad.

340
01:04:34.226 --> 01:04:37.561
Is this the end of the world?

341
01:05:01.461 --> 01:05:03.921
Good morning.
Are we going?


342
01:05:44.629 --> 01:05:47.214
Stand back!

343
01:05:53.346 --> 01:05:58.100
They're letting them out!
I knew they were in there.


344
01:05:58.185 --> 01:06:00.186
I used to listen in secret.

345
01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:28.547
The water had run out in my bathroom.
I hope you won't kill me.


346
01:06:33.386 --> 01:06:37.890
- I thought you'd left.
- No, I'm still here.


347
01:06:39.684 --> 01:06:42.478
- Good.
- You don't look pleased.


348
01:06:57.869 --> 01:06:58.911
Look.

349
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:01.831
Look what he gave me.

350
01:07:06.962 --> 01:07:09.004
- Who?
- Domenico!


351
01:07:33.947 --> 01:07:35.739
Why are you afraid
of everything?


352
01:07:37.367 --> 01:07:39.034
Full of complexes.

353
01:07:41.705 --> 01:07:43.455
You're not free.

354
01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:48.460
You all seem to want freedom,
you talk about freedom...


355
01:07:49.838 --> 01:07:53.132
but when you get it
you don't know what to do with it...


356
01:07:55.802 --> 01:07:57.678
or what it is.

357
01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:06.145
That's enough, that's enough.

358
01:08:08.356 --> 01:08:13.485
I know! It must be this country,
the air one breathes here.


359
01:08:13.987 --> 01:08:18.115
Because in Moscow
I met some wonderful men.


360
01:08:22.996 --> 01:08:25.372
What are you all after?

361
01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:27.833
These? Here!

362
01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.336
But not you.

363
01:08:31.171 --> 01:08:33.714
You're a kind of saint.

364
01:08:35.008 --> 01:08:36.842
You're interested in Madonnas.

365
01:08:37.177 --> 01:08:40.346
No! You're different.

366
01:08:43.683 --> 01:08:47.519
One "intellectual" tried
to keep me locked up.


367
01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:53.108
Can't I ever meet the right man?

368
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:58.280
I don't mean you,
you're the worst.


369
01:09:00.909 --> 01:09:04.453
But I swear I'll find
my kind of man.


370
01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:08.165
And I have,
he's waiting for me in Rome.


371
01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:11.043
You dress badly too.

372
01:09:12.087 --> 01:09:14.004
And you're boring.

373
01:09:15.632 --> 01:09:19.009
Do you know what a boring man is?
I'll tell you.


374
01:09:19.094 --> 01:09:22.638
You're the kind I'd sleep with
rather than explain why l don't feel like it.


375
01:09:22.722 --> 01:09:24.890
What are you saying, Eugenia?

376
01:09:28.728 --> 01:09:30.229
Don't you see?

377
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.236
I found myself
in a most embarrassing position.


378
01:09:43.576 --> 01:09:46.578
I've had enough!

379
01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:49.415
I can't take any more!

380
01:09:54.045 --> 01:09:57.047
I'd like to sleep for 10 days

381
01:09:57.632 --> 01:09:59.383
and wipe you out.

382
01:10:02.012 --> 01:10:05.931
Maybe there's nothing to wipe out
because you don't exist.


383
01:10:08.435 --> 01:10:10.269
It's my problem.

384
01:10:15.066 --> 01:10:17.818
I know why I like idiots.
I mean...


385
01:10:18.611 --> 01:10:21.155
Men with no charm, because...

386
01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:27.703
I might look young,
but I know all about charm.


387
01:10:31.332 --> 01:10:33.125
Go, go, please.

388
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.171
You know...

389
01:10:42.052 --> 01:10:45.971
when I met you,
that same night...


390
01:10:47.057 --> 01:10:51.143
I dreamt that a soft worm
with lots of legs...


391
01:10:52.479 --> 01:10:54.188
fell on my head.

392
01:10:55.648 --> 01:10:58.984
It stung me.
It was poisonous.


393
01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:01.945
I kept shaking my head

394
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:06.158
until it fell off.

395
01:11:06.242 --> 01:11:09.495
I tried to squash it...

396
01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:13.999
before it reached the wardrobe
but it was no good, because...


397
01:11:15.335 --> 01:11:20.089
because I kept just missing it.

398
01:11:21.049 --> 01:11:26.345
I just couldn't... squash it.

399
01:11:26.429 --> 01:11:27.930
Since that night...

400
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:33.102
I keep touching my hair.

401
01:11:34.687 --> 01:11:37.648
Thank God there's been
nothing between us!


402
01:11:41.444 --> 01:11:44.530
Just the thought makes me sick!

403
01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:53.914
She's insane.

404
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:01.547
Run back to your wife!
Though you nearly betrayed her!


405
01:12:01.798 --> 01:12:04.133
You're a pig, like everyone else.
Even worse...


406
01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:14.059
Anything else?

407
01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:15.936
Hypocrite!

408
01:12:19.649 --> 01:12:21.650
We're going to listen
to some music.


409
01:12:56.936 --> 01:12:59.563
- What's going on?
- Nothing, nothing.


410
01:13:02.442 --> 01:13:06.945
Oh, God!
Now the General and his Chinese music!


411
01:13:07.447 --> 01:13:10.616
But you won't drive me away!

412
01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:44.626
Dear Pyotr Nikolayevich,

413
01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:47.379
I've been in Italy 2 years,

414
01:14:47.463 --> 01:14:50.048
very important ones,

415
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:55.304
both for my profession as a musician
and for my everyday life.


416
01:14:56.347 --> 01:14:58.724
Last night I had a bad dream,

417
01:14:58.808 --> 01:15:04.021
I had to stage an opera
in the theater of My Lord the Count.


418
01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:09.443
The first act was set
in a park full of statues,


419
01:15:09.527 --> 01:15:14.906
but they were naked men painted
in white, forced to stand motionless.


420
01:15:16.075 --> 01:15:18.910
And I was a statue too.

421
01:15:20.079 --> 01:15:25.417
I knew I would be
harshly punished if I moved


422
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:30.922
because our lord and master
was watching us.


423
01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:36.470
I could feel the cold rising
from my marble pedestal...


424
01:15:37.889 --> 01:15:42.976
as the autumn leaves settled
on my upraised arm.


425
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:46.646
Yet I stood still.

426
01:15:47.482 --> 01:15:51.860
But when, exhausted,
I sensed I could resist no longer,


427
01:15:52.278 --> 01:15:53.737
I awoke.

428
01:15:55.323 --> 01:15:57.032
I was afraid.

429
01:15:57.408 --> 01:16:01.411
For I knew it had been no dream,
but my reality.


430
01:16:02.997 --> 01:16:07.959
I could try not to return to Russia,
but the thought kills me.


431
01:16:08.795 --> 01:16:14.800
Because I would die
if I never again saw my homeland...


432
01:16:15.885 --> 01:16:19.846
the birches,
the air of my childhood...


433
01:16:25.645 --> 01:16:29.648
An affectionate greeting
from your abandoned friend,


434
01:16:30.316 --> 01:16:31.942
Pavel Sosnovsky.

435
01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.129
Maria.

436
01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:00.710
Andrei!

437
01:21:33.953 --> 01:21:39.541
As a child I fell ill
from hunger and fear.


438
01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:43.670
I tear shreds of skin
from my lips.


439
01:21:43.754 --> 01:21:48.800
In my memory I lick traces of salt,
of freshness.


440
01:21:50.261 --> 01:21:53.722
And still I walk.

441
01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:58.268
I sit on a doorstep,
looking for warmth.


442
01:22:02.314 --> 01:22:06.025
I stagger deliriously
as to the piper's tune.


443
01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:14.159
I was hot, I opened my collar
and I lay down.


444
01:22:14.243 --> 01:22:18.371
The trumpets sounded.
A light pierced my eyelids.


445
01:22:18.789 --> 01:22:25.712
High above the pavement mother flies,
beckons with her hand...


446
01:22:27.757 --> 01:22:29.758
and flies away.

447
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:37.849
Now beneath the apple trees,
I dream of a white hospital.


448
01:22:39.643 --> 01:22:41.478
As a child I fell ill.

449
01:23:10.591 --> 01:23:12.842
I must go and see Dad.

450
01:23:18.891 --> 01:23:23.269
I have a jacket in the wardrobe.
It's been there three years.


451
01:23:24.647 --> 01:23:26.898
I'll wear it again
when I'm home in Moscow.


452
01:23:30.236 --> 01:23:33.238
I never go anywhere,
I never see anyone.


453
01:23:55.219 --> 01:23:57.262
What are you doing here?

454
01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:00.348
Don't be afraid.

455
01:24:07.273 --> 01:24:11.901
Don't be afraid of me.
It's I who should be afraid of you.


456
01:24:13.362 --> 01:24:15.738
You could shoot me.

457
01:24:17.616 --> 01:24:21.286
You know,
everyone shoots in Italy.


458
01:24:25.332 --> 01:24:29.586
And there are too many
Italian shoes.


459
01:24:34.717 --> 01:24:36.134
Dreadful!

460
01:24:39.889 --> 01:24:42.473
Everyone buys them.
Why?


461
01:24:50.482 --> 01:24:54.319
These are 10 years old.

462
01:24:55.029 --> 01:24:56.779
It's not important.

463
01:25:02.661 --> 01:25:03.953
All right.

464
01:25:07.041 --> 01:25:12.170
You know the great love stories,
the classics. No kissing.


465
01:25:13.172 --> 01:25:16.507
No kissing.
Nothing at all.


466
01:25:16.842 --> 01:25:18.217
Very pure.

467
01:25:20.387 --> 01:25:22.305
Hence great.

468
01:25:26.101 --> 01:25:31.397
Feelings unspoken
are unforgettable.


469
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.451
Here it's like in Russia.

470
01:25:47.247 --> 01:25:49.082
I don't know why.

471
01:25:53.712 --> 01:25:55.213
You know...

472
01:25:57.383 --> 01:25:59.884
I don't speak Italian well.

473
01:26:07.643 --> 01:26:09.352
Here's a story.

474
01:26:10.688 --> 01:26:17.068
A man saves another
who was sinking into a slimy pond...


475
01:26:19.738 --> 01:26:21.990
thereby risking his own life.

476
01:26:24.952 --> 01:26:29.288
Now they are both lying
on the edge of the pond


477
01:26:30.457 --> 01:26:32.375
out of breath,
exhausted.


478
01:26:38.757 --> 01:26:43.428
The rescued man says,
"Idiot.


479
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:50.226
Why did you do that?
I live in there!"


480
01:26:54.815 --> 01:26:56.482
I live in there.

481
01:26:57.443 --> 01:26:59.152
He took great offense.

482
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:07.618
- What's your name?
- Angela.


483
01:27:09.705 --> 01:27:12.540
Angela, good girl.

484
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.461
Are you happy?

485
01:27:17.379 --> 01:27:18.880
About what?

486
01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.382
About life.

487
01:27:22.509 --> 01:27:24.177
About life, yes.

488
01:27:33.479 --> 01:27:34.979
Good girl.

489
01:28:08.472 --> 01:28:10.431
Sight grows dim,

490
01:28:11.183 --> 01:28:15.686
my strength is two occult,
adamantine darts.


491
01:28:17.022 --> 01:28:22.110
Hearing weavers for my father's house
breathes distant thunder.


492
01:28:23.195 --> 01:28:26.364
The tissues of hard muscles weaken

493
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:29.242
like hoary oxen at the plow

494
01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:34.247
and no longer when night falls
do two wings gleam behind me.


495
01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:40.628
During the party,
like a candle I wasted away.


496
01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:44.674
Gather up at dawn my melted wax

497
01:28:45.467 --> 01:28:50.596
and read in it whom to mourn,
what to be proud of.


498
01:28:51.515 --> 01:28:55.476
How, by donating
the last portion of joy


499
01:28:56.353 --> 01:29:02.066
to die lightly and in the shelter
of a makeshift roof


500
01:29:02.151 --> 01:29:06.195
to light up posthumously,
like a word.


501
01:31:03.981 --> 01:31:06.315
Why must I think of this?

502
01:31:07.234 --> 01:31:09.151
I have enough worries.

503
01:31:11.863 --> 01:31:14.824
My God, why did I do it?

504
01:31:15.951 --> 01:31:19.954
They're my children, my family,
my own flesh and blood.


505
01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:24.166
How could I?

506
01:31:27.212 --> 01:31:32.258
Years without seeing the sun,
fearing the light of day.


507
01:31:33.135 --> 01:31:34.510
Why?

508
01:31:35.429 --> 01:31:37.096
Why this tragedy?

509
01:33:23.662 --> 01:33:26.831
Lord, do you see how he's asking?

510
01:33:27.499 --> 01:33:29.500
Say something to him.

511
01:33:29.584 --> 01:33:33.003
But what would happen
if He heard my voice?


512
01:33:33.713 --> 01:33:35.756
Let Him feel your presence.

513
01:33:36.425 --> 01:33:40.177
I always do,
but He's not aware of it.


514
01:36:30.348 --> 01:36:34.518
I'll bring the car around
in 10 minutes.


515
01:36:35.186 --> 01:36:38.188
Mr. Gorchakov,
phone call for you.


516
01:36:38.898 --> 01:36:40.858
- For me?
- Yes.


517
01:36:45.655 --> 01:36:47.740
Please, wait a minute.

518
01:36:53.788 --> 01:36:56.373
- In the lobby.
- Thank you.


519
01:37:00.879 --> 01:37:02.212
Hello?

520
01:37:03.548 --> 01:37:05.132
It's Eugenia.

521
01:37:06.092 --> 01:37:09.511
- How are you?
- Fine.


522
01:37:10.555 --> 01:37:12.806
- Guess why I called?
- Maybe because...


523
01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:14.850
No, no...

524
01:37:15.268 --> 01:37:19.313
Your Domenico is here,
the lunatic from Bagno Vignoni.


525
01:37:20.273 --> 01:37:24.985
Sorry, I know he's not mad.
It was so you'd understand.


526
01:37:25.654 --> 01:37:28.197
He's here in Rome
for a demonstration.


527
01:37:28.573 --> 01:37:30.366
They do weird things.

528
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:32.493
He's been making speeches
for three days.


529
01:37:32.577 --> 01:37:34.411
Like Fidel Castro.

530
01:37:36.414 --> 01:37:38.582
- Come and say good-bye to him.
- I'm leaving.


531
01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:41.085
- When?
- Immediately.


532
01:37:41.753 --> 01:37:44.505
Domenico asked me about you.

533
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:47.508
He keeps asking if you've done
what you were supposed to do.


534
01:37:47.592 --> 01:37:49.301
Of course.

535
01:37:49.386 --> 01:37:53.013
I'll tell him right away,
he's been waiting for this news.


536
01:37:53.098 --> 01:37:54.223
Thank you.

537
01:37:54.307 --> 01:37:56.475
I'm glad we could say good-bye.

538
01:37:57.519 --> 01:38:00.396
I'm leaving too, you know?
I'm going away with Vittorio.


539
01:38:01.064 --> 01:38:04.942
We haven't decided yet,
but we'll probably go to India.


540
01:38:05.944 --> 01:38:07.486
Vittorio's my man,

541
01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:09.988
he's interested in spiritual issues.

542
01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.408
He's from a distinguished family
in Orvieto.


543
01:38:12.784 --> 01:38:17.496
Good, Eugenia,
I wish you all the best.


544
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:21.041
Same to you.
Say hello to Moscow for me.


545
01:38:22.127 --> 01:38:24.878
How's your health?

546
01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:27.548
How's your heart?

547
01:38:27.924 --> 01:38:31.427
I don't know,
I've reached the limit.


548
01:38:33.722 --> 01:38:35.222
I'm bored.

549
01:38:37.434 --> 01:38:39.435
I want to go home.

550
01:38:47.235 --> 01:38:49.361
Good-bye, Vittorio.

551
01:39:17.098 --> 01:39:19.433
I'm going to buy some cigarettes.

552
01:40:19.369 --> 01:40:25.082
I want to change my ticket.
I'm leaving in two days' time.


553
01:40:26.084 --> 01:40:29.002
- What's happened?
- Nothing.


554
01:40:31.464 --> 01:40:35.717
Can you drive me
to Bagno Vignoni?


555
01:40:36.386 --> 01:40:37.970
- When?
- Now.


556
01:40:38.555 --> 01:40:41.098
- Yes, but we'll have to advise —
- Right.


557
01:40:43.768 --> 01:40:46.562
- I wait, right?
- Right.


558
01:40:49.315 --> 01:40:52.192
I had a feeling
you wouldn't leave today.


559
01:42:47.058 --> 01:42:49.351
What ancestor speaks in me?

560
01:42:49.727 --> 01:42:53.397
I can't live simultaneously

561
01:42:53.606 --> 01:42:56.066
in my head and in my body.

562
01:42:56.150 --> 01:43:00.737
That's why I can't be
just one person.


563
01:43:01.364 --> 01:43:06.910
I'm capable of feeling an infinite number
of things at the same time.


564
01:43:07.912 --> 01:43:14.710
There are no great masters left.
That's the real evil of our time.


565
01:43:14.794 --> 01:43:18.880
The heart's path is covered
in shadow.


566
01:43:18.965 --> 01:43:26.221
We must listen to the voices
that seem useless.


567
01:43:26.305 --> 01:43:30.892
In brains full
of long sewage pipes


568
01:43:30.977 --> 01:43:34.938
of school wall,
tarmac and welfare papers


569
01:43:35.023 --> 01:43:40.610
the buzzing of insects
must enter.


570
01:43:40.945 --> 01:43:44.614
We must fill the eyes
and ears of all of us


571
01:43:44.699 --> 01:43:49.202
with things that are
the beginning of a great dream.


572
01:43:49.287 --> 01:43:53.623
Someone must shout that
we'll build the pyramids.


573
01:43:53.708 --> 01:43:56.877
It doesn't matter if we don't.

574
01:43:56.961 --> 01:44:00.464
We must fuel that wish...

575
01:44:01.632 --> 01:44:06.136
and stretch the corners of the soul,

576
01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.600
like an endless sheet.

577
01:44:12.894 --> 01:44:17.147
If you want the world to go forward...

578
01:44:18.232 --> 01:44:21.026
we must hold hands...

579
01:44:22.278 --> 01:44:28.617
We must mix the so-called healthy
with the so-called sick.


580
01:44:29.744 --> 01:44:35.040
You healthy ones!
What does your health mean?


581
01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:41.088
The eyes of all mankind
are looking at the pit


582
01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:44.341
into which we are plunging.

583
01:44:45.843 --> 01:44:48.345
Freedom is useless

584
01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:53.725
if you don't have the courage
to look us in the eye,


585
01:44:54.685 --> 01:45:00.232
to eat, drink,
and sleep with us.


586
01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.569
It's the so-called healthy

587
01:45:05.530 --> 01:45:11.201
who have brought the world
to the verge of ruin.


588
01:45:16.249 --> 01:45:19.209
Man, listen!

589
01:45:20.336 --> 01:45:27.509
In you, water,
fire and then ashes.


590
01:45:27.593 --> 01:45:29.261
WE'RE NOT CRAZY
WE'RE SERIOUS


591
01:45:29.345 --> 01:45:32.139
And the bones in the ashes.

592
01:45:33.224 --> 01:45:37.310
The bones and the ashes.

593
01:46:33.659 --> 01:46:36.620
Wait for me in the car.

594
01:46:45.713 --> 01:46:47.047
Hello.

595
01:48:16.387 --> 01:48:23.393
Where am I when I'm not
in reality or in my imagination?


596
01:48:24.895 --> 01:48:27.230
Here's my new pact with the world:

597
01:48:27.898 --> 01:48:32.485
it must be sunny at night
and snowy in August.


598
01:48:32.862 --> 01:48:37.615
Great things end,
small things endure.


599
01:48:40.077 --> 01:48:46.166
Society must become united again,
instead of so disjointed.


600
01:48:47.752 --> 01:48:52.839
Just look at nature
and you'll see that life is simple.


601
01:48:53.674 --> 01:48:56.801
We must go back
to where we were,


602
01:48:57.595 --> 01:49:04.392
to the point
where you took the wrong turn.


603
01:49:07.772 --> 01:49:13.151
We must go back
to the main foundations of life...


604
01:49:14.528 --> 01:49:16.946
without dirtying the water.

605
01:49:19.533 --> 01:49:22.035
What kind of world is this,

606
01:49:22.787 --> 01:49:25.121
if a madman tells you...

607
01:49:26.457 --> 01:49:29.918
you must be ashamed
of yourselves!


608
01:49:32.713 --> 01:49:34.464
Music now.

609
01:49:37.468 --> 01:49:39.302
- Music!
- Music!


610
01:50:04.495 --> 01:50:06.496
I forgot this.

611
01:50:17.341 --> 01:50:20.385
Oh, mother!

612
01:50:22.054 --> 01:50:25.181
The air is that light thing...

613
01:50:26.434 --> 01:50:29.436
that moves around your head

614
01:50:30.271 --> 01:50:34.566
and becomes clearer
when you laugh.


615
01:51:16.066 --> 01:51:19.110
The music doesn't work!

616
01:52:53.497 --> 01:52:56.499
TOMORROW IS THE END
OF THE WORLD


617
02:05:24.956 --> 02:05:34.956
To the memory of my mother.
