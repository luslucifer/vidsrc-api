1
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.231
Guys, I'm about to take a giant ship.

2
00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.466
Thank you so much!

3
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.385
Thank you.

4
00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:51.306
Thank you so much...

5
00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:53.892
for being here. So...

6
00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:57.771
first up on the agenda is...

7
00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:58.897
I got engaged.

8
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.192
Thank you.

9
00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.945
I appreciate that enthusiasm.

10
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:08.323
I appreciate the applause
because I live in Los Angeles


11
00:01:08.448 --> 00:01:12.327
and when you tell people in L.A. that
you got engaged, they don't applaud.


12
00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:18.166
You tell people in L.A. you got engaged,
they're, like, "Good for you.


13
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.293
Good for..."

14
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.968
So you tell people you got engaged,
next obligatory thing out of their mouth


15
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.928
is, like, "How did you guys meet?

16
00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:38.562
How did you meet?"

17
00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:40.230
I don't like to tell people

18
00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:41.314
how we met.

19
00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:43.233
I don't like to
tell people how we met.

20
00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.277
It's not bad. It's not embarrassing.

21
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.945
It's just not cool.

22
00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:49.406
Like, we met on a dating app.

23
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.576
Right, like all of you. Yeah.

24
00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:57.122
We met on a dating app, which is...

25
00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:02.377
less of a product of my lack of creativity
and more a result of my generation.


26
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.545
I'm a millennial.

27
00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:05.464
That's how we meet each other, okay?

28
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.466
Yeah.

29
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.634
A dating app, at a bar,

30
00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:13.430
or it's, like, "I got her pregnant. Well,
Skylar will make a good mom." That's it.


31
00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.519
Some of you were so quiet when I said
I was a millennial. Fuck you, okay?


32
00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:25.317
I am... 35.

33
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.532
Which means I was born in 1983,

34
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:33.992
which means I am...

35
00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:35.410
right at the cutoff.

36
00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:38.830
Okay, so I am a millennial,

37
00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:40.665
but I am an elder!

38
00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:44.878
Elder millennial!

39
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.005
Wizened.

40
00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:49.466
Sage.

41
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:54.805
Yes, gather 'round the Snapchat, children.

42
00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:00.769
I'll tell you the tale...

43
00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:05.023
of the landline.

44
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.611
Hello, goodbye.

45
00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.115
When I was a young girl...

46
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:19.496
I once sent a text message
from a Sidekick.


47
00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.170
I remember when Skechers were invented.

48
00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:30.549
They were ugly then.

49
00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.635
And they're ugly now.

50
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:37.138
In high school...

51
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.976
we danced to a band called Sugar Ray.

52
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:49.860
How did you guys meet?

53
00:03:49.943 --> 00:03:52.445
You ask a girl,
"How did you guys meet?"

54
00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.615
We want to tell you.
We want to tell you...


55
00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:57.242
everything.

56
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.745
We want to give you personal information,
background story,


57
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.290
ancillary information,
anything information.


58
00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:04.833
Just say, "How did you meet?"

59
00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.043
Are you sitting down? Chapter One.
In seventh grade,


60
00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:10.338
I showed an aptitude for the clarinet.
We take it... back!


61
00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:13.216
We want you to know so much.

62
00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:16.052
You ask a guy,
"How did you guys meet?"

63
00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:20.098
Men don't volunteer personal information
as readily.


64
00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:23.059
Seldom will you meet a guy where
you're, like, "How did you guys meet?"


65
00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:26.229
And he's, like,
"So, I'm a Pisces, so I love faces."


66
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:32.485
A man's objective is often to let you know
not so much how they met,


67
00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:34.487
but to let you know that, like,

68
00:04:34.613 --> 00:04:36.698
"I could still fuck if I wanted to.

69
00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:39.284
'Cause I'm a fuck man.

70
00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:40.410
That's how I do.

71
00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:43.830
I'm not gonna fuck you,
cause I'm fucking her, but...


72
00:04:44.497 --> 00:04:47.000
I come from a long line of fuck men,
all right?


73
00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.545
My daddy was a fuck man,
my granddaddy was aÂ fuck man.


74
00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:52.672
I fuck.

75
00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.925
I pack up this dick,
on to the next town.

76
00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:57.802
Yeah.

77
00:05:00.722 --> 00:05:01.640
Fire in the hole.

78
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:05.977
Fuck Man Terry, that's what they call me."

79
00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.898
Down at the Walgreens, whatever.

80
00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:13.193
How did you guys meet?

81
00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:17.072
I say this next part as a woman
that champions other women,


82
00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:20.241
as a woman who chose to be single
for a very long time.


83
00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.494
I always feel, when single women ask me,

84
00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:24.287
"So, how did you guys meet?"

85
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:28.416
It's less about a genuine personal inquiry
for me,


86
00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:31.169
and it's more like
they're looking for clues, like,


87
00:05:31.252 --> 00:05:33.254
"Where did you find a suitor?

88
00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:38.760
Tell us your ways."

89
00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.261
Like, you walk in...

90
00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:42.931
to a Trader Joe's on a Sunday night.

91
00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.808
That's when hot girls
go grocery shopping.


92
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.726
Like, I'm buying flowers for me, right?

93
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.772
You walk into a Trader Joe's with a ring
on your left hand,


94
00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:53.942
single women can feel
the vibrations of the ring.


95
00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.653
Like, "The ring! 
It mocks us!" And they...

96
00:05:57.946 --> 00:06:00.323
They come out
of the frozen yogurt aisle...


97
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.951
Lululemon, highlighted hair, like,

98
00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.913
"Tell us your ways,
we wish to be betrothed as well.


99
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.249
Secrets.

100
00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.460
Tell us. Be a girl's girl."

101
00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:16.423
There's no secret, just so we're clear.

102
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:19.300
Don't buy the books. Don't buy the hype.
Don't listen...


103
00:06:19.384 --> 00:06:20.969
There's no secret, okay?

104
00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:23.430
I'm going to be
35 when I get married.

105
00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:26.641
And if there was a secret,
I would have fucking used it.


106
00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:28.810
There's no... secret.

107
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:31.396
There's no special magic to it.

108
00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.232
I'm never going to be, like,
"Gather round, ladies.


109
00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:36.901
Off the 405 lies a toadhole...

110
00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:41.865
You must go to it."

111
00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:47.037
No secret. Plus, chances are,
if you are single


112
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.539
and you are not enjoying that time
in your life,


113
00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:53.877
you're probably doing everything
in your power to not be single.


114
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.796
I don't know a single girl out there
that's, like, "I hate being single.


115
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.799
I don't get it. I wash
with ham and cat hair. Where is he?


116
00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:01.843
Where is he?"

117
00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:13.313
Women have no problem letting people know
that they are looking for a relationship.


118
00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:14.898
We shout it from the mountaintops.

119
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:16.024
We take a seminar.

120
00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:17.692
We take a class, we ask around.

121
00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:21.738
Are you single? Does your brother
have a brother? Do you have a sister?


122
00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:23.448
I will take anything at this point.

123
00:07:24.657 --> 00:07:27.160
We let people know...
We get license plates made


124
00:07:27.243 --> 00:07:29.746
like "LOOKIN4U." Like, we let you know.

125
00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.877
I feel like men are more laissez-faire
when it comes to relationships.


126
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.089
I guess I fell into her,
now we got four kids. It's kind of...


127
00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:42.842
It's less deliberate.
Women are, like, "This way."


128
00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:44.636
"I guess I'll just go that way."

129
00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:45.929
It just becomes.

130
00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:50.391
Their stories are less deliberate.

131
00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:53.144
I've asked a lot of guys,
"How did you meet your girl?"


132
00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:56.523
I've noticed that about 80%
of the stories sound very similar.


133
00:07:56.856 --> 00:07:59.901
80% of the time it's, like,
"How did we meet? All right, well...


134
00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:01.986
I was out with my buddies.

135
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:05.657
And you know me,
I wasn't looking for anybody.


136
00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:12.122
And then I saw her."

137
00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:15.542
And that <i>lie</i> becomes...

138
00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:20.463
A big part of our narrative as women,

139
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.759
this hope that we will go out
and a man is going to see us,


140
00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.219
save us, rescue us.

141
00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:30.223
It's this hope that we're going to be
seen and that's going to happen for us.


142
00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:34.144
And we all have this sort of shared
fantasy where you walk into a...


143
00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:37.897
a club or a bar with five of your
girlfriends who look exactly like you.


144
00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:42.652
And you walk in
and a man picks you out of the crowd,


145
00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:46.197
sees you for the beautiful soul
that you are, like, decides...


146
00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:49.325
like, there's some DJ up there
and he looks out and he's, like...


147
00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:51.161
"Her."

148
00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:53.955
And you're, like, "Me?"

149
00:08:57.959 --> 00:08:59.919
And then your life begins, right?

150
00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:05.008
This is not our fault for expecting this
or thinking this will happen.


151
00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:08.094
We have been taught this message
since we were little girls.


152
00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:10.013
Princesses get saved.

153
00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:12.515
Snow White got saved by the prince.

154
00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:16.227
It was really the seven dwarves
and she was, like, lost in a forest.


155
00:09:16.352 --> 00:09:17.270
But, like...

156
00:09:17.353 --> 00:09:18.188
seven men.

157
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.023
Who is she? Right.

158
00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:24.152
Sleeping Beauty was saved when the prince
kissed her while she was sleeping.


159
00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:25.612
Terrible moral.

160
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:32.160
What do we take away from that?
Generations of men, like,


161
00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:35.330
"No, you kiss 'em when they're sleeping,
they're forever grateful.


162
00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:38.791
Officer."

163
00:09:45.548 --> 00:09:48.885
So naturally we go out
hoping to be discovered.


164
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.055
There's this weird thing
where a lot of girls, when we're single,


165
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.642
we don't want to admit that we're
going out hoping a man notices us.


166
00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:58.603
Of course you are,
but we don't want to seem desperate.


167
00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:02.065
I'm just going out with my girlfriends,
in full makeup, with padded everything.


168
00:10:02.148 --> 00:10:04.025
This is just for fun. 
I'm just going out.

169
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.655
It's normal to want to be noticed
by someone that you find attractive.


170
00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:09.989
That's the caveat, okay?

171
00:10:10.073 --> 00:10:11.366
It's normal...

172
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:16.829
to want attention. EvenÂ in a relationship,
you still have a beating heart.


173
00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:19.540
You still want people to let you know
you're attractive.


174
00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:23.086
If you're with your guy, you're holding
his hand and you're walking,


175
00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:26.881
and you see some hot guy, like, "You like
that?" He's like, "I like that." Okay.


176
00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:30.426
No harm, no foul.

177
00:10:33.263 --> 00:10:35.223
We all try this bullshit, like,

178
00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:39.227
"I'm not even trying." Really? Then put
a feed bag over your head. Carry an onion.


179
00:10:39.352 --> 00:10:40.353
You're trying, okay?

180
00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:44.232
You don't have to try that hard, but
you're going out. It's nice to be noticed.


181
00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:45.984
So we all do it. 
Put on the makeup.

182
00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:48.278
Force our chub into some pants.

183
00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:52.115
You shove your coyote paws
into some heels and we go out.


184
00:10:57.161 --> 00:10:58.121
You don't even hunt.

185
00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:01.541
What do you do, girls? You just stand
in a pack of six other women.


186
00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.126
Six other coyotes.

187
00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:12.427
Getting annoyed
that no guy's hitting on you?


188
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.012
Yeah, there's six of you.

189
00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:14.929
He's terrified.

190
00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:21.185
We get annoyed so quickly when a guy
doesn't notice all the effort.


191
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:23.938
So what do you say?
Like, "This sucks, let's take a lap."


192
00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:25.148
So you just move...

193
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:28.776
in a perfume cloud
around the perimeter of the bar.


194
00:11:29.694 --> 00:11:31.779
Maybe they're more progressive
ten feet from here.


195
00:11:33.156 --> 00:11:34.949
So this begs the question, as women,

196
00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:36.492
as feminists...

197
00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:40.121
Maybe some... one or two lazy guys
might pause at the question.


198
00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:42.540
"How come the guy's got to hit
on the girl?


199
00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:44.083
You're an independent woman.

200
00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.793
Why can't a girl hit on a guy?

201
00:11:45.877 --> 00:11:47.754
Why can't the girl hit on the guy?"

202
00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:50.256
God's honest answer?
'Cause we did all this.


203
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.925
You fucking do something, Scott.
That's the answer.


204
00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:53.968
It's a lot.

205
00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:56.262
Okay.

206
00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:03.519
A lot. I haven't
had bread in five months.

207
00:12:03.603 --> 00:12:04.729
It's a lot, okay?

208
00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:08.399
A big part of the reason
women don't hit on men


209
00:12:08.483 --> 00:12:10.568
is that women aren't
seen as equal to men.

210
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:13.654
Therefore, when we step out
of a traditional feminine role,


211
00:12:13.738 --> 00:12:17.325
and do something alpha and hit on a guy
and he rejects us,


212
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.535
it hurts that much more.

213
00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:21.996
And on a biological level,

214
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.626
you know, at your core, he's not rejecting
you based on your shoes or your outfit.


215
00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:27.877
He's rejecting...

216
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.961
your eggs.

217
00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:36.886
You get up nerve to talk to a guy, like,
"Excuse me, would you like my eggs?"


218
00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:39.931
"I don't want those fucking eggs."

219
00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:41.849
Please! I only have but a few.

220
00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:46.854
Women aren't seen as equal to men,

221
00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:48.731
so it's uncomfortable to hit on men.

222
00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:51.359
There's a lot more at risk for us.
Maybe one day...


223
00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:54.570
in a utopia where men and women
are considered equal,


224
00:12:54.654 --> 00:12:59.200
maybe one day we can hit on men
unencumbered by self-esteem issues.


225
00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:02.245
But as it stands now,
that's not something we can do.


226
00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:04.247
Our grandmothers didn't hit on men.

227
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.916
Our mothers didn't hit on men.
Maybe one day.


228
00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:10.086
Maybe my generation changes it.
It's too late. But...


229
00:13:11.754 --> 00:13:14.715
maybe my generation,
with the hashtags and the tweets,


230
00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:18.094
maybe we'll change it
so that our great-granddaughters


231
00:13:18.177 --> 00:13:20.346
can hit on men. 
Yes, that's the dream,

232
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.598
that we do the work now

233
00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:25.768
so that our great-granddaughters
will know the thrill


234
00:13:25.852 --> 00:13:29.897
of hitting on a half-in-the-bag Guido
outside a taco truck


235
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:31.482
at 2 a.m.

236
00:13:34.652 --> 00:13:35.987
'Tis but a dream.

237
00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:41.242
Another big part of the reason
that women don't hit on men is that


238
00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:43.786
men are better at dealing with rejection.

239
00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:45.246
Sexually.

240
00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:47.165
Women are not used to dealing...

241
00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:49.417
with rejection... when it comes to sex.

242
00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:52.837
We're used to dealing with rejection when
it comes to... governing our own bodies,


243
00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:55.590
having our own thoughts, getting paid
the same as a man, but...


244
00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:57.258
when it comes...

245
00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:02.805
When it comes to sexual rejection,

246
00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:07.143
men deal with it more than women
because they have more at bats.


247
00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:08.603
They hit on women more.

248
00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:11.898
Ask the guy next to you, "When was the
last time you were sexually rejected?"


249
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:15.651
He'll be, like, "You mean in the Uber
on the way here? At the box office?


250
00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:19.530
Like, behind that plane while you were
in theÂ bathroom? Be specific."


251
00:14:22.074 --> 00:14:23.409
'Cause every guy knows...

252
00:14:23.868 --> 00:14:25.411
it's about the at bats.

253
00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:27.580
It's about how many times
can you hit on a girl.


254
00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:29.999
'Cause you know
eventually one's going to say yes.


255
00:14:30.124 --> 00:14:33.711
When men first start going out,
it's about quantity over quality,


256
00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:36.464
like, "Hey, sweetheart!
You're ugly anyway. How about you?"


257
00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:37.840
You keep going through it.

258
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:41.552
Every guy knows you got to kiss a lot
of frogs if you're gonna what, guys?


259
00:14:41.636 --> 00:14:43.721
Fuck a frog, that's right. So...

260
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.476
'Cause he knows. They're not going
to admit it to you, every guy knows


261
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.686
If he hits on, like,
20 women in a night,

262
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.647
one's gotta say yes.

263
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.774
Like, one gross-out's gotta be, like...

264
00:14:54.857 --> 00:14:56.651
"Yeah, all right."

265
00:14:56.734 --> 00:15:00.363
2 a.m. It's his Hail Mary,
at the buzzer pass,


266
00:15:00.446 --> 00:15:04.617
the lights are coming on, he's like,
"How about you?"


267
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.912
Some girl will turn around and be, like,
"Okay.


268
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:11.457
Can we wash my
hump before we make love?

269
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.794
Just kidding. It's an egg.

270
00:15:14.877 --> 00:15:15.753
So...

271
00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:23.177
By that same token, men aren't allowed

272
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:25.680
to have feelings in our society,
which isn't fair.


273
00:15:25.763 --> 00:15:28.849
You're expected to move past it,
work through it. Get over it.


274
00:15:29.308 --> 00:15:31.227
Women don't get over...

275
00:15:31.978 --> 00:15:32.937
anything.

276
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:36.649
No, we don't get over it.

277
00:15:36.732 --> 00:15:39.193
Instead, we hold onto it.

278
00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.071
We hold onto that rejection.

279
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.155
We hold onto it.

280
00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:47.493
We pluck it out of space-time
and we examine it from hindsight.


281
00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:49.078
We put it in different scenarios.

282
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.747
We bring in experts, like,
"Stacy, get over here!


283
00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:56.669
Remember that guy,
took me to Coachella, never called again?


284
00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:57.878
Shall we drive to his house?"

285
00:16:00.715 --> 00:16:04.802
And sometimes... we hold onto the pain
of our rejection


286
00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.387
so tight...

287
00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:08.347
that theyÂ become part...

288
00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:11.392
of the makeup of our personalities.

289
00:16:11.934 --> 00:16:16.022
And then we get to use the pain
of that past rejection, ladies,


290
00:16:16.105 --> 00:16:22.612
as an excuse for why we are the weird
brand of fucked-up that we are, now!


291
00:16:31.078 --> 00:16:32.913
'Cause he broke up with me over breakfast,

292
00:16:32.997 --> 00:16:36.542
so now I don't drink milk, and I'm
annoying. Like, it's always... something.


293
00:16:38.085 --> 00:16:41.631
Every girl in here remembers
almost every time she was rejected.


294
00:16:41.714 --> 00:16:43.966
For women, it doesn't happen as much
as for men.


295
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.054
And every human remembers the first
time they were rejected. I'll go first.


296
00:16:48.137 --> 00:16:49.472
Fourth grade. So...

297
00:16:50.848 --> 00:16:53.601
We were going to
sit down for circle time.

298
00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:58.022
I went and sat by a boy
that I thought was cute.


299
00:16:58.105 --> 00:16:59.607
And he told me to go away.

300
00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:02.860
Now, he's dead.

301
00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:07.573
Now I don't sit in circles any more.

302
00:17:10.117 --> 00:17:11.869
But we cherish our rejections.

303
00:17:11.952 --> 00:17:14.038
They give us texture, personality.

304
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.123
We take each one and we label it.

305
00:17:16.207 --> 00:17:19.960
We label each issue, each past grievance,
in its own Mason jar.


306
00:17:20.044 --> 00:17:21.879
It's very rustic. Pin it. 
And we put it...

307
00:17:22.797 --> 00:17:26.258
into our sack of emotional baggage.
Each one.


308
00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:28.761
He broke up with me
because I slept with his brother.


309
00:17:28.844 --> 00:17:31.597
They're twins. They should have worn
different color hats or something.


310
00:17:32.848 --> 00:17:34.475
I was set up. And we put it...

311
00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:37.770
into our baggage, and we throw
that baggage over our shoulder


312
00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:39.522
and what do we do, girls?

313
00:17:39.605 --> 00:17:44.527
We then walk it into the <i>new</i>relationship.

314
00:17:44.944 --> 00:17:49.115
Yes. And the best part is,
the new boyfriend...


315
00:17:50.157 --> 00:17:51.200
has no idea...

316
00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:56.372
what you're hauling.

317
00:17:56.455 --> 00:17:59.917
And he welcomes you.
Yes, he welcomes you


318
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.168
to the new union.

319
00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:04.547
Come on in. You seem pretty cool
and well-adjusted.


320
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.758
And you're, like, "Oh, I am!

321
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:14.432
Yes, this seems like a safe place
for me to...


322
00:18:14.974 --> 00:18:17.685
unpack my shit!"

323
00:18:26.652 --> 00:18:29.113
Another big reason
women don't hit on men


324
00:18:29.196 --> 00:18:34.076
is because men... typically don't find
strong women attractive.


325
00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:37.788
They don't. Your date's going
to look at you, like, "No way, babe.


326
00:18:37.872 --> 00:18:40.875
I love a strong woman."
Bullshit, Chad, okay?


327
00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:45.129
They love vulnerability.

328
00:18:45.212 --> 00:18:47.965
It's very attractive
when a woman is vulnerable.


329
00:18:48.048 --> 00:18:48.924
Why is that?

330
00:18:49.008 --> 00:18:50.718
Men are very physical creatures.

331
00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:52.928
Women are very verbal.
Men are very physical.


332
00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:56.056
When a woman is vulnerable,
hypothetically, it would mean...


333
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.850
that she needs physical help.

334
00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:00.603
When a man feels he can be of help,
physically,


335
00:19:00.686 --> 00:19:03.856
then he feels needed, and that makes
him feel good and attractive.


336
00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:06.901
When a man feels he can insert himself.
No pun intended.


337
00:19:06.984 --> 00:19:10.196
Fuck it. We're making a comedy show.
Pun intended, okay?


338
00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:13.324
You got to give him something to do.

339
00:19:13.407 --> 00:19:15.743
We, as women, a
lot of times fault men

340
00:19:15.826 --> 00:19:17.953
for not communicating the way we do.

341
00:19:18.037 --> 00:19:20.372
Women speak more words on average
than men.


342
00:19:20.456 --> 00:19:24.126
It's not that one's better or dumber
than the other, it's the way we are.


343
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.421
We talk <i>at</i>you. "I wanna be communicative
about being communicative.


344
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:30.424
You're not saying anything. Why?
You're being uncommunicative.


345
00:19:30.508 --> 00:19:34.553
And I want to talk about how much I hate
Stacy. When you meet her, you're gonna."


346
00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:35.596
We have to have...

347
00:19:36.096 --> 00:19:39.266
He's just sitting there, like,
"Mongo, no." Like, it's scary.


348
00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:43.979
If you have any
doubt a guy likes you,

349
00:19:44.063 --> 00:19:46.690
don't always look for the words,
look for the actions.


350
00:19:46.774 --> 00:19:47.900
They will show you.

351
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.694
I wish someone had told this to me
when I was in my 20s.


352
00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:53.989
When you're younger, you're, like,
"He's not texting back. He's busy.


353
00:19:54.073 --> 00:19:55.491
He's at work. His family died."

354
00:19:55.574 --> 00:19:57.076
There's no bullshit like that.

355
00:19:58.077 --> 00:20:00.120
When a guy likes you, he shows up.

356
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:02.873
If you have any
doubt the guy likes you,

357
00:20:02.957 --> 00:20:04.583
give him something to do.

358
00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:06.335
If a guy likes you, he'll do anything.

359
00:20:06.418 --> 00:20:08.671
Will you carry this glittery brick
of cat shit?


360
00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:09.880
He's, like, "No problem."

361
00:20:15.928 --> 00:20:18.889
When a guy likes you,
carrying your purse isn't an issue.


362
00:20:18.973 --> 00:20:20.683
They'll carry your bags if they're heavy.

363
00:20:20.766 --> 00:20:23.394
They'll put gas in the car
if you don't want to deal.


364
00:20:23.477 --> 00:20:25.312
They'll check under the hood for the...

365
00:20:25.813 --> 00:20:26.856
thing, I don't know.

366
00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:27.982
But they'll do that.

367
00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:33.779
It's very attractive when a woman
is vulnerable and needs help.


368
00:20:33.863 --> 00:20:36.115
And that's historically
always been that way.


369
00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:38.492
I didn't make that up.
That's why the term is...


370
00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:40.035
<i>"damsel</i> in distress".

371
00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:43.330
Not "overly opinionated dyke
who needs a fucking hand, man!"


372
00:20:43.414 --> 00:20:44.248
That's why.

373
00:20:48.836 --> 00:20:52.298
If a woman can do it herself,
it's not as attractive. Put it this way.


374
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:54.008
If we're all animals, okay?

375
00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:55.384
And men are...

376
00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:56.343
lions.

377
00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:59.555
And women are, like, gazelles.

378
00:20:59.638 --> 00:21:02.766
What's a lion, if he's hungry,
more likely to go after?


379
00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:05.311
The gazelle, running at 90,

380
00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:07.479
unencumbered by a self-esteem issue?

381
00:21:07.563 --> 00:21:09.899
Like, I own my
home and have a Ph.D.

382
00:21:24.872 --> 00:21:27.833
I enjoy witty banter,
I just put a down payment on a boat,


383
00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:30.210
and I don't hate my daddy. Onward!

384
00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:36.634
Or...

385
00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.346
remember he's hungry. Or...

386
00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:44.433
the gazelle with the broken hoof, like,
"Help, how does basketball work?"


387
00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:45.351
Like, what?

388
00:21:49.813 --> 00:21:50.940
An easier meal.

389
00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:55.694
Side note.

390
00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:59.323
I am aware that it's the lioness
not the lion that does the hunting.


391
00:21:59.406 --> 00:22:03.285
Let's pretend that lion was a bachelor
and hadn't met his wife yet. Okay, so...


392
00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:06.038
We got the zoologist questions
out of the way.


393
00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:08.415
So...

394
00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:10.501
I will stand up here,

395
00:22:10.584 --> 00:22:14.088
and perhaps women in your life you
consider strong will stand before you


396
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:17.299
and tell you,
"Be strong, do it your way, be tough."


397
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.594
It's one thing to say that,
and for a lot of women


398
00:22:20.678 --> 00:22:22.554
it's very difficult to live that

399
00:22:22.638 --> 00:22:25.641
when everything that we're taught
tells us the opposite.


400
00:22:25.724 --> 00:22:28.394
Every movie we've seen
since we were little girls


401
00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:29.895
has an opposite message.

402
00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:32.314
In movies, it's not the strong girl,

403
00:22:32.439 --> 00:22:34.733
the funny girl, the brave girl,

404
00:22:34.817 --> 00:22:39.113
the smart girl, the loud girl,
the opinionated girl who gets the hot guy.


405
00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:43.450
No, girls like me get, like, fucking Steve
Zahn and Jonah Hill. Like, that's what...


406
00:22:44.702 --> 00:22:48.664
She <i>is</i>funny, he <i>looks</i>funny, then they'll
fuck funny and appreciate each other.


407
00:22:48.747 --> 00:22:50.249
And it's always...

408
00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:53.877
it's always the quiet girl.

409
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:56.255
Right, the new girl that gets, like,
Channing Tatum.


410
00:22:56.338 --> 00:23:00.009
It's always the girl that doesn't realize
how beautiful she is.


411
00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:02.636
The girl that isn't funny,
isn't opinionated.


412
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.140
The subtext of that message is,
"That's right. That's right, girls.


413
00:23:06.223 --> 00:23:09.768
Men don't like a lippy woman,
so zip it, honey."


414
00:23:11.437 --> 00:23:14.023
It's always the girl
that doesn't know she's hot.


415
00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:17.067
Which, by the way,
that Hollywood archetype? Bullshit.


416
00:23:17.151 --> 00:23:19.528
Okay? It's bullshit.

417
00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:24.074
Because you fucking know when you're hot.

418
00:23:25.242 --> 00:23:26.744
No one's walking around, like,

419
00:23:26.827 --> 00:23:29.538
"What do I do with these giant tits
and thin legs?"


420
00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:38.547
How did I get on this Victoria's Secret
catwalk? I'm choking on my silky hair."


421
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.090
Like, you know.

422
00:23:43.635 --> 00:23:46.180
We keep seeing the same story
over and over.


423
00:23:46.263 --> 00:23:48.766
It's about the girl
that's unsure of herself,


424
00:23:48.849 --> 00:23:50.434
and a guy sees through it,

425
00:23:50.517 --> 00:23:53.645
and she realizes how beautiful she is
when she takes off her glasses...


426
00:23:53.729 --> 00:23:55.105
it's the same thing.

427
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:58.525
Always the girl, like,
"I don't know if I should go out."


428
00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:01.278
The girls that are outgoing that maybe
enjoy their bodies,


429
00:24:01.361 --> 00:24:03.072
are confident, like, "Let's go out!"

430
00:24:03.155 --> 00:24:06.909
"I don't know. I should stay home.
I've never left the house before."


431
00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:11.872
We're taking you out. Let's go drink,
let's go dance...


432
00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:13.749
I should stay in. 
Stay in and study.

433
00:24:13.832 --> 00:24:17.169
We're 35. What are you
fucking talking about? Let's go!


434
00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:22.382
Walk into the nightclub,

435
00:24:22.466 --> 00:24:25.177
all the girls that are confident
are dancing, they're having fun.


436
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.181
Like, "Hey, Channing Tatum!"
He's, like, "Later, hookers. I want her!"


437
00:24:29.807 --> 00:24:30.641
All the girls...

438
00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:32.392
"Uh-uh. Her."

439
00:24:32.476 --> 00:24:35.729
Cut to our hero, she's just sitting there
in a corner, just...


440
00:24:35.813 --> 00:24:39.525
maybe she wore, like, board shorts
to the club. She has no idea.


441
00:24:39.858 --> 00:24:41.443
She's reading a book.

442
00:24:42.402 --> 00:24:44.696
Maybe she has brown hair. Whatever.

443
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.618
Before you get all offended at that,

444
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.412
look at all of our eyebrows.
We all have brown hair, okay.


445
00:24:54.206 --> 00:24:55.624
Maybe not you, I don't know.

446
00:24:56.917 --> 00:24:59.211
I don't see any
pure Norwegians here, okay?


447
00:25:00.629 --> 00:25:05.050
This joke isn't about
shaming that type of woman.


448
00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:07.177
This joke is not about that.

449
00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:09.179
Whatever kind of woman you are,

450
00:25:09.263 --> 00:25:11.807
quiet, fat, small, big or tall,

451
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.851
loud, you don't know much,
you got a gill,


452
00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:15.602
whatever kind of woman you are...

453
00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:18.397
you are right.

454
00:25:19.189 --> 00:25:20.023
That's it.

455
00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:22.401
Whatever you've chosen to be...

456
00:25:23.944 --> 00:25:25.320
whatever you want to be...

457
00:25:27.614 --> 00:25:30.742
you are correct in being that
as long as you're happy.


458
00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:34.454
My point to you, is if you are
the shy type,


459
00:25:34.538 --> 00:25:36.540
if you are the wallflower,

460
00:25:36.623 --> 00:25:38.458
if you are the shrinking violet,

461
00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:42.087
if you are another... floral metaphor
that has to do...


462
00:25:43.005 --> 00:25:45.340
with being an introvert,
my point to you


463
00:25:45.424 --> 00:25:50.762
is that you don't want the guy who wants
you because of that energy.


464
00:25:50.971 --> 00:25:54.099
A man who wants a woman
because she looks scared...


465
00:25:54.725 --> 00:25:56.185
is a sexual predator.

466
00:25:58.854 --> 00:25:59.688
Okay?

467
00:26:02.858 --> 00:26:04.985
All these girls that he could hit on,

468
00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:08.071
he picks the one that's shivering
like a wet chihuahua.


469
00:26:09.114 --> 00:26:12.618
Like a nervous street urchin
just in a corner


470
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.578
putting out all kinds of "no" vibes.

471
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:17.581
You don't want the guy that walks up,
like, "Excuse me.


472
00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:20.083
I couldn't help but notice
you look terrified.


473
00:26:23.962 --> 00:26:25.839
Wanna see my dick?" So...

474
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.887
"I was out with my buddies.

475
00:26:32.971 --> 00:26:34.514
I wasn't looking for anyone.

476
00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:37.726
And I saw her."

477
00:26:38.936 --> 00:26:40.520
The idea...

478
00:26:41.146 --> 00:26:43.273
that in a nightlife setting...

479
00:26:43.774 --> 00:26:46.443
that the man would ever see the woman...

480
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.072
before the woman saw the man.

481
00:26:56.328 --> 00:26:57.162
No.

482
00:26:58.413 --> 00:27:02.834
Women are astute, but moreover, women
are the ones with the biological clocks.


483
00:27:02.918 --> 00:27:06.421
Women are the ones with
the socially predetermined shelf life.


484
00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:09.841
Women are the ones who are cantilevered
off the edge of high heels.


485
00:27:09.925 --> 00:27:11.885
We've got five hours
before we take them off


486
00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:13.762
and walk through a lobby flat-foot, okay.

487
00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:17.474
Women are the ones whose skin
and foundation is dehydrating


488
00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:19.476
with every alcoholic beverage imbibed.

489
00:27:20.018 --> 00:27:23.647
We are the ones on a time crunch,
on a schedule, okay?


490
00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:25.232
You saw me first?

491
00:27:25.315 --> 00:27:26.733
Bullshit, motherfucker.

492
00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:27.734
I clocked you!

493
00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:39.204
Like, the second you walked in.

494
00:27:39.288 --> 00:27:43.375
Dudes walk in in a pack, unaware, like,
"I'd better fill out this bracket,


495
00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:46.295
or I'll turn into a pumpkin at midnight."
You're not even...


496
00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:50.173
You walked in, I was already hunting
with five other women.


497
00:27:50.757 --> 00:27:52.843
He walked in and I was, like, "Hold!"

498
00:27:52.926 --> 00:27:54.928
And then we stalked around you.

499
00:27:57.806 --> 00:28:01.101
Encircled you, sussed you out,
like a German shepherd


500
00:28:01.184 --> 00:28:05.147
sniffing out an IED in the sand,
motherfucker. Like, we...


501
00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:11.528
A lot of times, men pride themselves
on being very observant, right?


502
00:28:11.737 --> 00:28:13.572
Ever date a guy that,
you go to a restaurant,


503
00:28:13.655 --> 00:28:15.991
can't sit with his back to the door?

504
00:28:16.783 --> 00:28:20.662
"I gotta sit with my back to the wall
so I can assess all entrance


505
00:28:20.746 --> 00:28:23.415
and exit points. 
I gotta make sure that..."

506
00:28:23.498 --> 00:28:26.126
Okay, while you're checking out
the people eating at Denny's,


507
00:28:26.209 --> 00:28:28.545
I checked your fucking credit score, okay?

508
00:28:30.714 --> 00:28:32.841
While you were doing counter-surveillance,

509
00:28:32.924 --> 00:28:36.386
I looked you up and down,
I gave you a pre-cancer mole check.


510
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.722
It's benign, move on.
I looked at everything.


511
00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:43.101
"I'm an alpha. 
I gotta look at the door."

512
00:28:43.268 --> 00:28:46.521
If you ever date a man that says
he's an alpha...


513
00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:48.106
he's a beta. So...

514
00:28:50.317 --> 00:28:52.110
A lion doesn't tell you he's a lion.

515
00:28:53.236 --> 00:28:55.322
He just lets the girl hunt for him.
Okay, so...


516
00:28:56.823 --> 00:29:00.035
So, we look at everything.
You think men judge women harshly?


517
00:29:00.118 --> 00:29:03.872
They do. But, gentlemen, you have no idea
what we're looking at.


518
00:29:04.748 --> 00:29:06.792
We're judging your hair, your shoes,

519
00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:09.252
we scan you, like Predator.

520
00:29:11.046 --> 00:29:15.300
Every atom, every molecule of your DNA,
we go through it like...


521
00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:18.720
"Scanning for physical abnormalities.

522
00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:25.977
Is he balding? Okay, but is it in
a weird way?


523
00:29:35.362 --> 00:29:37.823
Is that a goatee? 
What's happening there?

524
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.957
Is his shirt unbuttoned too low
for his ethnicity?


525
00:29:55.173 --> 00:29:57.134
Is he wearing embroidered jeans?

526
00:29:57.217 --> 00:30:01.471
If so, is he a European male
or just someone from Arizona?"


527
00:30:01.555 --> 00:30:02.848
Like, we go through it.

528
00:30:06.017 --> 00:30:07.352
We go through it.

529
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:15.902
We aren't looking to see
if you're the hottest guy ever. Nay.


530
00:30:15.986 --> 00:30:20.490
We are merely assessing
if you're 50% attractive enough


531
00:30:20.574 --> 00:30:24.619
that we want to put the effort
into putting ourselves in your orbit.


532
00:30:24.703 --> 00:30:29.708
So that, in an hour,Â after a drink or two,
you, gentlemen, have the luxury


533
00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:33.712
of turning around and being, like, "Oh,
excuse me, I couldn't help but notice."


534
00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:35.297
Then we turn around, like...

535
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.715
Really?

536
00:30:39.426 --> 00:30:42.095
That's it.
Just set it up for you to knock it down.


537
00:30:43.722 --> 00:30:48.268
A lot of times it's not that easy.
We see a guy we think is cute...


538
00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:52.731
and he doesn't notice us,
so we have to <i>make</i> you... notice us.


539
00:30:53.607 --> 00:30:56.526
A lot of times, we get our girlfriend
to help us. Every girl's done this.


540
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.279
There's a boy over there you think
is cute, you're, like, "Come here.


541
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:02.365
Do you see that guy, over there?

542
00:31:04.743 --> 00:31:05.619
Over there.

543
00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:07.829
Over there.

544
00:31:08.622 --> 00:31:10.957
Do you see him? Do you see that guy?
Are you looking?


545
00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:12.959
Don't look!
Do you see him? Are you looking?


546
00:31:13.668 --> 00:31:16.213
Is he looking? He's looking? He's looking?
Start dancing.


547
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:26.806
Come here, keep talking. Say something
funny so I don't look like a loser."


548
00:31:31.645 --> 00:31:33.146
You're trying to put out...

549
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.857
this vibe that you're so carefree.

550
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:39.819
'Cause you, and don't lie about this,
you want him to look over and be, like,


551
00:31:39.903 --> 00:31:43.657
"There will never be another, there
has never been another. She is the one."


552
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.909
You want him to be so taken.

553
00:31:45.992 --> 00:31:48.495
"She looks like she doesn't need a man,
so carefree."


554
00:31:48.578 --> 00:31:50.455
I'm so carefree, 
I don't use condoms!

555
00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:55.210
So effortless.

556
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:02.425
If he was close, he wouldn't be hearing
it. From afar, you want him to hear...


557
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:03.677
Sports.

558
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.513
If he were close,
what he'd actually hear is your...


559
00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:08.473
Like, you're trying so hard.

560
00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:09.683
Please!

561
00:32:12.185 --> 00:32:14.896
He's going to find you,
he'll see you at some point.


562
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.567
There's only so many places in a bar,
a club, that your eyes can fall.


563
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.820
He's going to see you.
This is the important part girls, okay?


564
00:32:21.903 --> 00:32:24.281
You're out there,
it's a competitive situation.


565
00:32:24.364 --> 00:32:26.616
There's a lot of girls,
there's a lot of bars.


566
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.536
He's gonna look at you,
that's your chance, okay?


567
00:32:29.703 --> 00:32:31.538
That's your chance.
You've only got one shot.


568
00:32:32.455 --> 00:32:34.457
It's like <i>8 Mile,</i> but with flirting.

569
00:32:36.626 --> 00:32:38.628
Hopefully there's no vomit on your shirt.

570
00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:43.216
Maybe it's a good thing. He'd be, like,
"She parties!" I don't know.


571
00:32:44.175 --> 00:32:47.554
He's going to look over, the lights
are going to reflect and refract,


572
00:32:47.637 --> 00:32:49.639
and they'll hit you both and
he's gonna see you,


573
00:32:49.723 --> 00:32:51.349
and that's your chance, ladies,

574
00:32:51.433 --> 00:32:53.059
to fucking stick it, and pose,

575
00:32:53.143 --> 00:32:55.270
like a peacock in heat that you are.
Just...


576
00:33:10.994 --> 00:33:12.370
Don't dance like that.

577
00:33:14.372 --> 00:33:16.541
Little bit of insight to stand-up comedy,

578
00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:19.210
and the risk and reward
with choosing certain jokes.


579
00:33:19.294 --> 00:33:21.588
That joke is a risk because I realize

580
00:33:21.671 --> 00:33:24.549
not every one here knows...
what a peacock sounds like.


581
00:33:26.843 --> 00:33:29.304
But for, like, the
12 of you that knew,

582
00:33:29.638 --> 00:33:31.389
it was so worth it for me.

583
00:33:38.563 --> 00:33:40.273
And for the rest of you,

584
00:33:40.357 --> 00:33:43.026
the good news is
you don't ever have to hear a peacock,


585
00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:46.905
'cause that was, like, top ten peacock
impressions you're going to hear...


586
00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:48.281
tonight.

587
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.705
I hate it. I hate the noise.
I'm allowed to make fun of peacocks,


588
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:57.165
'cause I grew up with them.

589
00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:01.753
What I find so unsettling,
if I might divert from the stand-up


590
00:34:01.836 --> 00:34:04.798
to a TED Talk about ornithology
for two seconds, the...


591
00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:07.842
it's the dip in the mating call
that gives me...


592
00:34:09.844 --> 00:34:10.845
It's just not...

593
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:16.351
We, as avian enthusiasts, which is
why you've come to my comedy show...


594
00:34:17.977 --> 00:34:20.689
enjoy consistency in a mating call.

595
00:34:20.772 --> 00:34:23.024
Like, a crow or a raven is like...

596
00:34:23.108 --> 00:34:25.068
It just goes. Right?

597
00:34:25.985 --> 00:34:30.740
And a dove and its low-rent cousin,
the pigeon, that's just...


598
00:34:33.326 --> 00:34:34.160
Right?

599
00:34:37.163 --> 00:34:39.457
The dove and the bird it
loans money to, just...


600
00:34:41.876 --> 00:34:44.754
Right? And we all know a warbler
goes like...


601
00:34:45.922 --> 00:34:47.549
"I'm a warbler." I don't know. And then...

602
00:34:49.509 --> 00:34:51.010
and the bald eagle is, like,

603
00:34:51.094 --> 00:34:53.263
"Fucking freedom!" Okay, so...

604
00:34:54.222 --> 00:34:55.056
we know.

605
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.854
To me, the peacock sounds
like a tired hooker.


606
00:35:02.147 --> 00:35:06.067
Like he's just standing on the corner,
like, "You want a fuck or what?


607
00:35:15.452 --> 00:35:17.495
I already paid for the room."

608
00:35:19.372 --> 00:35:22.709
Another side note,
I realize the peacock is the male.


609
00:35:22.792 --> 00:35:24.544
They're the ones with the plumage.

610
00:35:24.627 --> 00:35:27.630
The female peacock is a peahen.
Their colors are muted.


611
00:35:27.714 --> 00:35:30.967
So really it's a feminist joke
'cause it's about a male prostitute.


612
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.552
Mmm, okay, so...

613
00:35:37.932 --> 00:35:41.853
So you peacock and he sees you, and he
walks up. "I couldn't help but notice..."


614
00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:44.939
And you start talking,
maybe you have some drinks,


615
00:35:45.023 --> 00:35:48.526
maybe you dance, maybe you exchange
numbers, maybe you start to date.


616
00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:53.156
Now, I happen to think the very beginning
of a new relationship


617
00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:55.825
is the most exciting part
of the relationship.


618
00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:57.577
Granted, I'm not married yet,

619
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.663
so, technically, I've only had beginnings
of relationships.


620
00:36:01.748 --> 00:36:05.835
I don't know. I can't say empirically
how fun being married is.


621
00:36:05.919 --> 00:36:09.214
I'll tell you on the next comedy special
what that's all about.


622
00:36:10.173 --> 00:36:11.257
But I don't know.

623
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.430
The beginning of a relationship
is exciting because it's brand new.


624
00:36:17.514 --> 00:36:19.224
You're both on your best behavior,

625
00:36:19.307 --> 00:36:20.683
it's still electric,

626
00:36:20.767 --> 00:36:25.063
you're not totally sure about the history
of mental illness in each family.


627
00:36:25.146 --> 00:36:25.980
It's fun.

628
00:36:26.064 --> 00:36:29.067
And the most nerve-wracking part
of a new relationship


629
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.235
when you're younger,

630
00:36:30.318 --> 00:36:33.530
is the first time a boy comes over
to your apartment.


631
00:36:33.905 --> 00:36:37.408
'Cause it's ostensibly like
your girlfriend audition time.


632
00:36:37.492 --> 00:36:41.871
You want him to come in and be, like,
"It's so homey. I'd like to stay forever."


633
00:36:41.955 --> 00:36:44.123
Yes, come closer.
Like, that's what you want.


634
00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:46.918
You try so hard in your 20s, right?

635
00:36:47.001 --> 00:36:50.213
Because you're young, and it's fun.
That's your 20s. In your 30s...


636
00:36:52.382 --> 00:36:54.968
In your 30s,
homeboy knocks on the door, you open it,


637
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:58.388
you're in combat boots, nothing else,
and a garbage can on fire, you're, like,


638
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:00.181
"Welcome to Fuckdome, Scott."

639
00:37:06.688 --> 00:37:07.981
Ticket? Okay, so...

640
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.320
But it's interesting, in your 20s,
it's a weird mental game.


641
00:37:14.404 --> 00:37:17.782
Boy's coming over for the first time,
you're trying to reconcile


642
00:37:18.074 --> 00:37:22.036
the beautiful home that your mother kept
that you lived in growing up,


643
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.958
with the beautiful home that, like,
Pinterest says you're supposed to have.


644
00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:30.336
And the fact that you have
no fucking money, so...


645
00:37:31.004 --> 00:37:33.798
Should I buy a rug or eat dinner?
I don't know.


646
00:37:33.882 --> 00:37:34.841
It's so hard.

647
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.802
Boy's coming over, you are cleaning

648
00:37:37.886 --> 00:37:40.847
like you've never cleaned before,
and it's hard


649
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.309
because women secretly are... filthy.

650
00:37:45.518 --> 00:37:48.104
No one wants to
laugh about it. "Not me!"

651
00:37:48.187 --> 00:37:51.649
And no guy wants to imagine, like,
"No way, my girlfriend's so hot."


652
00:37:51.733 --> 00:37:55.862
Yeah? You think you have a hot girlfriend?
Check the center console of her car.


653
00:38:01.284 --> 00:38:02.994
She's owned that car for a decade.

654
00:38:03.077 --> 00:38:05.413
Every year, the shit just piles up.

655
00:38:05.496 --> 00:38:09.125
You open it, like, "I didn't know an Acura
came with a time capsule!" You shut it.


656
00:38:10.627 --> 00:38:11.669
You open it again.

657
00:38:11.753 --> 00:38:14.255
You just hear, "Help!"
There's something in there.


658
00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:17.675
It's our little filthy secret stockpile,
right?


659
00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:21.679
It's a <i>Now That's What I Call Music</i>CD.
"In case they come back!" Yeah.


660
00:38:21.763 --> 00:38:26.225
It's one of those cables that plugs
from the tape player into the CD player.


661
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:29.312
It's spilled nail polish,
it's a little bit of weed dust.


662
00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:33.900
It's a... Calgon body spray, 'cause you'd
rather smell like a stripper than weed.


663
00:38:34.984 --> 00:38:38.363
It's that...
It's a Lip Smacker, Dr Pepper flavor,


664
00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:41.532
that's just... lying there with a gash
in the wax neck,


665
00:38:41.616 --> 00:38:44.494
like, "Tell my children I died well."
Like it's...


666
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.705
it's an iPhone 4 charger.

667
00:38:49.749 --> 00:38:51.292
It's some McDonald's napkins.

668
00:38:52.335 --> 00:38:53.670
It's a French fry.

669
00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.008
Times that center console by a million...

670
00:38:59.092 --> 00:39:00.593
in her apartment.

671
00:39:00.677 --> 00:39:04.347
You are just cleaning
with Swiffer and Brawny.


672
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.849
It's like a winter wonderland
of paper towels.


673
00:39:06.933 --> 00:39:09.352
You're just shoving shit under the rugs.

674
00:39:09.435 --> 00:39:11.604
You didn't build a shelf,
I dunno how that fucking works.


675
00:39:11.688 --> 00:39:14.232
You're just moving everything,
you take everything...


676
00:39:14.315 --> 00:39:17.819
You put your coats in the oven.
Burn 'em! I live in L.A. Take everything.


677
00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:22.615
Put your cat in a hamper for now, Marbles.
We don't know how he feels about cats.


678
00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:27.495
Taking everything, you're cleaning. You're
discovering new rooms in your apartment.


679
00:39:27.578 --> 00:39:30.289
How come the water heater
gets its own closet? Fuck it!


680
00:39:31.499 --> 00:39:35.294
You beg your gross-out roommate,
"Please, just stay in your room.


681
00:39:35.378 --> 00:39:36.796
You're so fucking disgusting."

682
00:39:36.879 --> 00:39:40.341
She's there, on a throne
of Wendy's wrappers, like, "Okay!


683
00:39:42.343 --> 00:39:45.471
You text me dick pics."
Hello. Shut the door.


684
00:39:46.014 --> 00:39:50.226
Cleaning. Lighting Glade candles
like it's a fucking Catholic mass.


685
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:53.354
Smells like ham in here!
You're just trying to make it nice.


686
00:39:53.438 --> 00:39:56.524
He opens the door. You're, like, "Hi!"
He walks in. He's, like,


687
00:39:56.899 --> 00:39:58.860
"Oh, place is cool."
You're, like, "Fuck you."


688
00:40:12.749 --> 00:40:14.333
And there's an art, by the way,

689
00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:18.504
to the outfit you wear the first time
a boy comes over to your place at night.


690
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.884
You don't want to wear...
what you wore during the day.


691
00:40:22.967 --> 00:40:26.846
Don't want work clothes. You don't want
to wear your daytime clothes, 'cause...


692
00:40:27.597 --> 00:40:28.765
'cause it's nighttime.

693
00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.434
What if that was
the end of my show?

694
00:40:32.769 --> 00:40:33.853
I hit my head.

695
00:40:35.396 --> 00:40:38.232
You don't want to wear
your civilian clothes, okay.


696
00:40:38.316 --> 00:40:41.069
'Cause you had a whole day. Maybe you
sweat in them, they're gross.


697
00:40:41.152 --> 00:40:44.030
However, at the other end
of the sartorial spectrum,


698
00:40:44.113 --> 00:40:49.744
you don't want to go, like, super hardcore
sexy the first time a guy's coming over.


699
00:40:49.827 --> 00:40:52.705
Just relax. You don't want to wear
nipple tassels. Now...


700
00:40:54.207 --> 00:40:56.042
some women are, like, "Wait a minute."

701
00:40:57.627 --> 00:41:00.838
I am the woman
that has stood here before

702
00:41:00.922 --> 00:41:03.174
and will stand here before you again
and let you know


703
00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:04.926
you can wear whatever you want.

704
00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:08.846
It doesn't give a man the right to put
his hands on you. No always means no.


705
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.099
That's like a boiler-plated given.

706
00:41:16.437 --> 00:41:18.356
No means no. Kindergarteners get it.

707
00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:21.609
I don't know why we forget that
as adult males, but...


708
00:41:22.151 --> 00:41:24.862
no means no. This is less about that,

709
00:41:24.946 --> 00:41:28.699
and more about just being mentally kind
to the other person.


710
00:41:28.783 --> 00:41:31.160
You show up in that,
he'll be, like, "Oh, my god!"


711
00:41:31.244 --> 00:41:34.163
The blood's gonna go from here
to his dick, he's gonna impale himself,


712
00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:36.707
he's gonna sue you,
and you ain't got no money. So...


713
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.920
just be kind,
because, mentally, it's like,


714
00:41:41.003 --> 00:41:44.257
"Maybe she wants me. I don't know.
Oh, my god." It's frustrating.


715
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.260
You know, girls, it'd be like
if you have the worst day,


716
00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:49.387
you came home to your boyfriend, like...

717
00:41:50.263 --> 00:41:51.347
"I had the worst day.

718
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.515
I got fired, and...

719
00:41:53.015 --> 00:41:55.017
I cried in front of everyone

720
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:57.103
and... I ate that
French fry from my car.

721
00:41:59.647 --> 00:42:01.274
It was just such a hard day."

722
00:42:01.357 --> 00:42:05.153
Your boyfriend's like, "Aw, babe. You want
to talk about it?" You're, like, "Yeah."


723
00:42:05.236 --> 00:42:08.156
He's, like, "Just kidding. Psych."
That's what it would be like.


724
00:42:10.074 --> 00:42:13.536
So the question is, if I can't wear work
clothes, I can't wear nipple tassels,


725
00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:15.037
what's a girl to do?

726
00:42:15.913 --> 00:42:19.417
There's an entire, sort of intermediary,

727
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.171
post-dinner, pre-bedtime apparel world.

728
00:42:23.254 --> 00:42:25.256
There's a whole category of clothing

729
00:42:25.339 --> 00:42:28.467
that you, as women, have mastered
without even realizing it.


730
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:30.219
The category is called

731
00:42:30.303 --> 00:42:31.470
athleisure wear.

732
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:37.894
This is an entire clothing category.

733
00:42:37.977 --> 00:42:41.397
It's a multi-billion-dollar
clothing category


734
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.566
predicated on the idea that, as a woman,

735
00:42:43.649 --> 00:42:45.735
sometimes you don't have time to change

736
00:42:45.818 --> 00:42:49.071
when you're going from the boardroom
to Pilates. There's no fucking way.


737
00:42:49.155 --> 00:42:50.281
You gotta be ready.

738
00:42:50.615 --> 00:42:53.409
Sometimes you're going right from spin
to open-heart surgery,


739
00:42:53.492 --> 00:42:55.411
and you've got to look good.
That's...


740
00:42:55.494 --> 00:42:58.080
Spin to open-heart surgery?
How about my bed to my couch?


741
00:42:58.164 --> 00:42:59.707
What are you fucking talking about?

742
00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:05.213
So what is athleisure wear? It's athletic
apparel you wouldn't really work out in.


743
00:43:05.296 --> 00:43:08.507
Right? So it's... yoga pants
with, like, a racing stripe.


744
00:43:08.591 --> 00:43:10.218
You just... race to your snacks.

745
00:43:13.387 --> 00:43:15.932
Sometimes it's like
a complicated tank top.


746
00:43:17.308 --> 00:43:19.310
It's, like, not quite supportive.

747
00:43:19.393 --> 00:43:21.062
They're, like, "It's backless."

748
00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:23.272
What do you do?
"You don't wear a bra."


749
00:43:23.356 --> 00:43:25.191
I'm sorry, what the
fuck did you just say?

750
00:43:27.652 --> 00:43:28.653
I don't wear a bra?

751
00:43:28.736 --> 00:43:32.531
So if the athletic part comes into play,
and I have to run, it's gonna be...


752
00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:34.075
No!

753
00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.622
My whole life...
they've been pitching to me,


754
00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:42.083
"It's a tank top,
there's a shelf built in."


755
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.877
It's a... Go fuck your <i>shelf,</i>okay?

756
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:45.795
I want a bra.

757
00:43:46.879 --> 00:43:47.838
I want a bra!

758
00:43:53.469 --> 00:43:56.597
We do that. Sometimes we'll do, like,
a push-up bra under the tank.


759
00:43:56.681 --> 00:43:59.809
Show the strap off.
It's got to be a cute strap. Not beige.


760
00:43:59.892 --> 00:44:01.394
No one goes, "Ooh, beige."

761
00:44:03.479 --> 00:44:05.940
Like magenta.
'Cause that's not as sexy as red.


762
00:44:06.023 --> 00:44:09.026
Magenta's like, "Maybe we'll fuck."
Red's like, "We're gonna fuck!"


763
00:44:10.027 --> 00:44:12.738
Push-up bra.
That's what we do for you, gentlemen.


764
00:44:12.822 --> 00:44:14.782
You have no idea... of the sacrifices.

765
00:44:16.284 --> 00:44:20.496
Not a woman here wears a push-up bra
when she's at home with the flu.


766
00:44:22.248 --> 00:44:26.002
No one walking around, like, "I just like
it when myÂ nipples are near my tongue."


767
00:44:27.962 --> 00:44:29.463
It's just safer that way.

768
00:44:31.507 --> 00:44:33.009
He gets to be comfortable.

769
00:44:33.342 --> 00:44:36.512
You're all bundled up, sitting there
in a push-up bra on your couch,


770
00:44:36.595 --> 00:44:39.140
drinking with this dude
you're having a date with.


771
00:44:39.223 --> 00:44:41.058
He's got his shoes off, shirt off.

772
00:44:41.142 --> 00:44:44.312
You're suffocating under your own tits,
watching <i>House Hunters.</i>


773
00:44:45.396 --> 00:44:46.397
Crown molding.

774
00:44:52.028 --> 00:44:55.614
You're all dressed up, have a nice night.
Maybe sleep together, maybe you don't.


775
00:44:55.698 --> 00:44:59.785
That's not what I'm interested in. What I
want to talk about is the next morning,


776
00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:01.579
when he goes to leave.

777
00:45:01.954 --> 00:45:04.540
What I've always found so endearing
about men...


778
00:45:04.623 --> 00:45:06.584
I find many things endearing about you.

779
00:45:07.126 --> 00:45:08.002
But...

780
00:45:09.545 --> 00:45:12.214
you think... we stay...

781
00:45:12.298 --> 00:45:13.966
that put-together...

782
00:45:14.842 --> 00:45:16.010
once you're gone.

783
00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:19.305
You have no idea.

784
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:22.683
They have no idea... what lies beneath.

785
00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:27.646
You have no idea... that under the hair,
and the make-up, and the lashes,


786
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.732
and the shelf, and the bras...

787
00:45:30.232 --> 00:45:31.442
for every woman,

788
00:45:31.525 --> 00:45:33.069
lies the beating heart

789
00:45:33.152 --> 00:45:34.487
of a hungry...

790
00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:35.821
exhausted...

791
00:45:35.905 --> 00:45:37.114
annoyed...

792
00:45:37.198 --> 00:45:39.325
she-dragon!

793
00:45:46.624 --> 00:45:50.086
And she is waiting to come out.
She comes out every couple hours.


794
00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:54.298
Like opinions, sweat, urine. Hopefully you
pee more than every couple hours, still.


795
00:45:54.382 --> 00:45:57.093
She's got to. You gotta let her out,
and she's waiting.


796
00:45:57.176 --> 00:46:00.096
And homeboy is taking forever to leave,
he's, like,


797
00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:02.515
"All right, I guess
I'll give you a call later."


798
00:46:02.598 --> 00:46:04.016
Your dragon's, like, "Get out!

799
00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:07.395
Get out. I got to
take a shit. Get out!

800
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.487
Get rid of him. I gotta go in that
bathroom I share with another grown woman


801
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.198
and take a Jurassic thunderdump,
mostly in the bowl,


802
00:46:19.281 --> 00:46:21.575
then send him a picture
like I'm doing something hot."


803
00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:22.576
Hey. "Get out!"

804
00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:28.165
I feel like the boys here
don't believe me.


805
00:46:29.834 --> 00:46:32.711
That breaks my heart. I want you
to trust me, okay?


806
00:46:32.795 --> 00:46:35.965
You don't believe me that there's a dragon
inside every woman.


807
00:46:36.048 --> 00:46:37.967
I will prove it to you. 
Are you ready?

808
00:46:38.759 --> 00:46:40.010
There's no zipper, okay.

809
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.598
I'll let you prove it to yourselves.
Tomorrow, when you leave your girl,


810
00:46:44.682 --> 00:46:47.017
okay, and you're saying goodbye
at the door...


811
00:46:47.768 --> 00:46:49.103
here's what you want to do.

812
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.439
Look deep in her eyes.

813
00:46:52.148 --> 00:46:55.985
This is great, because, she'll be, like,
"Oh, my god, he's mesmerized by me.


814
00:46:56.068 --> 00:46:57.945
This is amazing. 
I'm doing amazing."

815
00:46:58.028 --> 00:46:59.196
Great, let her think that.

816
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.908
It buys you time, gentlemen. Because
what you're looking for in her eyes


817
00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:05.494
is like a nictitating membrane, okay.

818
00:47:07.288 --> 00:47:11.041
For those who don't know, it's the lid
under the lid that keeps the sand out.


819
00:47:12.501 --> 00:47:14.920
You need more <i>Planet Earth</i> from Netflix
in your lives, okay.


820
00:47:15.004 --> 00:47:16.338
That's what you're looking for.

821
00:47:16.422 --> 00:47:19.633
If you want to see...
the dragon come out on its own,


822
00:47:19.717 --> 00:47:22.636
just prolong your goodbye,
'cause that dragon's coming out.


823
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.264
Nothing you can do about it.
Just take a little longer.


824
00:47:25.347 --> 00:47:28.517
All right, well, I have your number,
right? Lemme make sure.


825
00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:30.603
Okay, great, you have my number. Bye!

826
00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:41.697
You're just flying round
your own studio apartment.


827
00:47:42.865 --> 00:47:45.367
You can't go outside.
You will get shot down.


828
00:47:46.076 --> 00:47:48.370
Like, this isn't fucking King's Landing.
Like, you can't...


829
00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:52.124
you're just doing it for the cardio.

830
00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:55.794
Tiny pulses, ladies.
We're toning, we're firming.


831
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.465
You fly into your kitchen.

832
00:47:59.757 --> 00:48:01.050
You land on your counter.

833
00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:05.596
You're hungry, right?
So you take out a talon.


834
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.518
You skewer an entire sleeve of Oreos.

835
00:48:17.233 --> 00:48:18.234
You toast it.

836
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.036
Your dragon body and your farts

837
00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:32.540
aren't the only thing
you've been holding in all night.


838
00:48:32.623 --> 00:48:35.417
You've also been holding in...
your intentions.


839
00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:39.171
We have this really nasty habit
in our society


840
00:48:39.255 --> 00:48:43.175
of labeling women very cruel
and unfair things


841
00:48:43.259 --> 00:48:46.595
when they express their desire
for very normal things.


842
00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:49.723
Monogamy, exclusivity, a relationship,

843
00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:51.809
a family, babies. Right?

844
00:48:51.892 --> 00:48:55.396
We like to call them desperate,
sad, psychos, baby crazy.


845
00:48:55.479 --> 00:48:56.939
"We've been married for six years.

846
00:48:57.022 --> 00:49:00.150
She already wants a kid! I'm a fuck man!
They can't get me."


847
00:49:02.194 --> 00:49:04.405
It's very normal to want these things.

848
00:49:04.488 --> 00:49:06.657
And we like to chastise women for this.

849
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.868
And so, as women,
sometimes we don't speak our truth.


850
00:49:09.952 --> 00:49:13.539
You go on a first date, and a guy says,
"Do you want to have kids?"


851
00:49:13.622 --> 00:49:14.873
And you say no.

852
00:49:14.957 --> 00:49:16.292
Or I don't know.

853
00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:18.961
When you do know.
Because you don't want to what?


854
00:49:20.212 --> 00:49:21.130
Scare them off.

855
00:49:22.673 --> 00:49:23.757
By the way...

856
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.053
if you're the kind of woman that doesn't
want kids, you're still a woman.


857
00:49:28.137 --> 00:49:30.556
This joke's not about you.
Wait your turn, okay.


858
00:49:34.602 --> 00:49:35.894
Another "by the way."

859
00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:37.479
Gentlemen...

860
00:49:37.896 --> 00:49:41.317
you ask a girl if she wants to have kids,
and she says yes...


861
00:49:41.984 --> 00:49:43.986
it doesn't necessarily mean with you.

862
00:49:52.745 --> 00:49:53.912
And it's interesting...

863
00:49:53.996 --> 00:49:57.708
because your views about relationships
or marriage or children


864
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:59.251
do change the older you get.

865
00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:01.503
Some girls are in
the crowd, in your 20s,

866
00:50:01.587 --> 00:50:04.381
you're, like, "Whatever, elder millennial.
I don't care.


867
00:50:04.882 --> 00:50:08.177
I'm 20. I'm going to be a gypsy
and make jewelry out of cat noses.


868
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.386
Yeah. I don't care."

869
00:50:10.888 --> 00:50:13.891
I get it. That's totally fair.
I was like that at one point.


870
00:50:13.974 --> 00:50:17.978
Society tells you over and over,
they say, "How old are you?" "I'm 23."


871
00:50:18.062 --> 00:50:19.938
"Oh, my god, you have so much time."

872
00:50:20.022 --> 00:50:20.856
And you do.

873
00:50:20.939 --> 00:50:22.107
But not much.

874
00:50:22.566 --> 00:50:23.525
So...

875
00:50:25.486 --> 00:50:28.530
It's not about deciding now,
it's about not writing it off totally.


876
00:50:28.614 --> 00:50:30.783
Because I never thought about it,
God's honest truth.


877
00:50:30.866 --> 00:50:34.578
I wasn't anti or for. I figured
you get a boyfriend, life goes on.


878
00:50:34.662 --> 00:50:39.208
When I was in my 20s, I loved... still do...
stand-up, traveling, working.


879
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.794
And I figured, when you turn 30,
the government issues you


880
00:50:41.877 --> 00:50:45.089
a house, an okay-looking husband,
a baby, a plant, you're done!


881
00:50:46.256 --> 00:50:47.591
I never thought about it.

882
00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:51.136
And it's interesting,
because my reaction to children,


883
00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.222
and I don't know
how many kids I want.

884
00:50:53.305 --> 00:50:56.100
I don't want like a Duggar situation,
but maybe one.


885
00:50:56.725 --> 00:50:58.352
One cool baby. I don't know.

886
00:50:58.936 --> 00:51:01.855
I'd be in the airport in my 20s
and I'd hear a baby cry.


887
00:51:01.939 --> 00:51:04.358
All the women would be, like,
"Oh, my god, it's a child."


888
00:51:04.441 --> 00:51:08.362
I'd be, "Oh, my god, don't sit by me.
Like, that's all. Get it away."


889
00:51:08.987 --> 00:51:11.198
It's interesting,
'cause I never thought about it.


890
00:51:11.281 --> 00:51:14.910
It changes slightly, the chemistry,
the way you think about it.


891
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:16.704
I was in the airport the other day.

892
00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:18.330
There was a baby there.

893
00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:20.416
And the baby made a big mistake.

894
00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:22.835
'Cause that baby...

895
00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:25.587
let a chubby baby leg...

896
00:51:26.463 --> 00:51:28.048
hang from his blankie.

897
00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:32.052
I had to squeeze it.

898
00:51:35.222 --> 00:51:38.976
I was, like, "What is this feel..."
I found myself moving toward the mother.


899
00:51:40.394 --> 00:51:43.105
And I knew... intrinsically, I knew...

900
00:51:43.188 --> 00:51:45.107
she would let me squeeze his leg.

901
00:51:46.275 --> 00:51:49.194
Because women don't fear other women.

902
00:51:49.403 --> 00:51:53.240
When it comes to children, not like
the corporate ladder or dating, but...


903
00:51:54.074 --> 00:51:57.703
she knows I'm not creepy
and I mean that baby no harm.


904
00:51:57.786 --> 00:52:00.080
That's something we can trade on as women.

905
00:52:00.164 --> 00:52:01.915
Women aren't scary.

906
00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:06.962
Late at night, if a woman's walking toward
you, you don't cross to the other side.


907
00:52:07.045 --> 00:52:09.173
I mean, you do if she's, like,
"Purple hippo!"


908
00:52:12.468 --> 00:52:15.220
When you're in an elevator
and a woman gets on,


909
00:52:15.304 --> 00:52:17.765
you don't clutch your purse
and back up a little.


910
00:52:17.848 --> 00:52:20.476
Women aren't scary
and women aren't creepy.


911
00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:22.519
That's an important thing to remember.

912
00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:26.023
No matter what we get faulted for,
and we'll get faulted for a lot,


913
00:52:26.106 --> 00:52:28.942
things like aging,
things you can totally control.


914
00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:33.280
No matter how much weight you gain,
how many wrinkles you get,


915
00:52:33.363 --> 00:52:37.576
no matter how opinionated you are,
no matter what you become as a woman,


916
00:52:37.826 --> 00:52:42.206
women are welcome around public parks
and children's birthday parties.


917
00:52:43.999 --> 00:52:48.295
Always. I could go to
an elementary school right now


918
00:52:48.378 --> 00:52:51.799
in a hospital gown,
with a raccoon on a leash...


919
00:52:53.842 --> 00:52:56.970
and the children would be, like,
"You have a weird dog."


920
00:53:07.147 --> 00:53:10.818
Because of that inherent fact
that women are not creepy.


921
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:12.945
Men.

922
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:17.825
All you've got to do
is part your hair wrong.


923
00:53:20.077 --> 00:53:23.914
So I get up near this baby,
I wipe the sweat from my brow,


924
00:53:23.997 --> 00:53:26.875
I calm myself and say to the woman,
"Excuse me, hi.


925
00:53:30.921 --> 00:53:32.756
I need to squeeze your baby's leg."

926
00:53:34.299 --> 00:53:38.011
She was, like,
"Absolutely! Get in there! Get in there!


927
00:53:38.095 --> 00:53:42.391
His name is Charlie." She gave meÂ his
blood type, his social security number...


928
00:53:42.808 --> 00:53:46.478
There's an art to squeezing a baby leg.
You're not actually squeezing.


929
00:53:46.562 --> 00:53:48.355
You're taking your pincher fingers,

930
00:53:48.438 --> 00:53:51.733
and you're putting it like this,
and lightly oscillating...


931
00:53:53.735 --> 00:53:56.113
allowing the fat to rapidly undulate...

932
00:53:56.655 --> 00:53:59.283
so fast it looks like a fluid motion,

933
00:53:59.366 --> 00:54:02.411
not unlike the flapping
of a hummingbird's wings, okay.


934
00:54:04.788 --> 00:54:06.373
This is how I give a hand job.

935
00:54:08.125 --> 00:54:10.127
Baby leg!

936
00:54:13.547 --> 00:54:17.718
Any pressure you would apply to said
leg, you divert up to your back molar,


937
00:54:17.801 --> 00:54:19.094
and you grind it.

938
00:54:21.555 --> 00:54:24.808
When you feel enamel starting
to break down, that's how you know


939
00:54:24.892 --> 00:54:26.768
you gotta get out of there, okay.

940
00:54:26.852 --> 00:54:29.771
You know you're at maximum capacity
for cuteness


941
00:54:29.855 --> 00:54:33.233
when you start making
thinly veiled threats to the child.


942
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.861
I'm going to eat that leg.

943
00:54:37.654 --> 00:54:38.864
I'm gonna bite that nose!

944
00:54:38.947 --> 00:54:41.491
The mom was into it!
She was, like, "Eat his fucking leg!"


945
00:54:42.409 --> 00:54:45.579
I'm gonna eat that leg. "Bite his fucking
nose!" I'm gonna eat that nose!


946
00:54:46.747 --> 00:54:49.791
Everyone's into it, except the kid
who's being the adult. He's, like,


947
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:50.834
"What the fuck is this?"

948
00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.217
Baby leg.

949
00:55:01.219 --> 00:55:05.933
So... back to our original narrative.
You're a dragon in your kitchen.


950
00:55:09.144 --> 00:55:12.689
And those maternal, we don't have to
restrict it to just women.


951
00:55:12.773 --> 00:55:16.777
Paternal, parental. Those maternal urges
start to bubble up.


952
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.988
Because they're unrealized. You did not
verbalize last night on your date


953
00:55:20.072 --> 00:55:23.158
that you might, one day, possibly,
with the right person, want kids.


954
00:55:23.241 --> 00:55:26.662
It's bubbling up, you're sitting there,
eating your Oreos, like...


955
00:55:27.162 --> 00:55:27.996
Baby.

956
00:55:29.957 --> 00:55:31.041
I want a child.

957
00:55:32.459 --> 00:55:33.293
Family.

958
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:34.795
Baby.

959
00:55:34.878 --> 00:55:36.713
Who's the baby?

960
00:55:36.797 --> 00:55:41.259
You look over and who do 100%
of us take out our parental urges on?


961
00:55:41.343 --> 00:55:42.886
Our pets.

962
00:55:43.804 --> 00:55:46.431
Who's the baby?

963
00:55:49.851 --> 00:55:51.478
Your dog is sitting there, like,

964
00:55:51.895 --> 00:55:53.563
"Oh, fuck, it's me!"

965
00:55:56.358 --> 00:55:59.903
And you, scoop him up,
you don't give him a chance to run.


966
00:55:59.987 --> 00:56:02.572
You sweep all four legs,
Daniel-san, just...


967
00:56:03.407 --> 00:56:06.952
And you throw him on his back!
The dog's, like, "This is not natural!"


968
00:56:07.035 --> 00:56:10.122
And then you start to rock it.
Now you're a psychopath.


969
00:56:11.123 --> 00:56:14.209
Who's the baby? And the dog's, like,
"Please, I'm nauseous!"


970
00:56:14.292 --> 00:56:17.129
You're an angel. Who wants kisses,
who wants kisses?


971
00:56:17.796 --> 00:56:19.423
The dog doesn't know they're kisses.

972
00:56:19.506 --> 00:56:23.218
All the dog sees are your canine incisors
coming at his face.


973
00:56:24.052 --> 00:56:28.015
This tooth right here is whatÂ lets him
know that you're a fucking carnivore.


974
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:32.728
Human beings don't get this close
to other human beings' faces


975
00:56:32.811 --> 00:56:34.771
unless it's like a UFC weigh-in, like,

976
00:56:34.855 --> 00:56:37.190
"I'm gonna eat you, motherfucker!"
That's exactly...


977
00:56:37.274 --> 00:56:39.860
Who's the baby?
The dog's, like, "Please put me down!"


978
00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:42.070
Who wants belly kisses?

979
00:56:42.154 --> 00:56:43.447
"Please don't bite my dick!"

980
00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:49.703
It doesn't even occur to you
that he might be terrified.


981
00:56:49.786 --> 00:56:51.705
You're, like, "Oh, he loves his mama."

982
00:56:51.788 --> 00:56:52.956
He loves... He loves you?

983
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:58.754
Next time, notice the Cirque du Soleil
stunt your dog is willing to pull...


984
00:56:58.837 --> 00:57:01.381
to get away from your love. He's, like,

985
00:57:01.465 --> 00:57:03.008
"I died well!"

986
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.225
Dog looks up at you.

987
00:57:13.018 --> 00:57:14.352
Closes his blouse.

988
00:57:16.646 --> 00:57:20.150
Goes and hides under something
he deems impenetrable,


989
00:57:20.233 --> 00:57:21.943
like a kitchen chair.

990
00:57:26.448 --> 00:57:29.284
"Yes, from behind these four legs,
I will lead the war."


991
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:33.872
What's really fucked-up...

992
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.958
is that ten minutes later...

993
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:39.628
the dog has forgotten.

994
00:57:41.963 --> 00:57:44.007
He's forgotten the broad strokes...

995
00:57:44.758 --> 00:57:46.510
of the abuse. Here's what he knows.

996
00:57:47.844 --> 00:57:50.347
He knows something bad... happened.

997
00:57:52.015 --> 00:57:55.268
He knows...
something bad will happen again.


998
00:57:56.978 --> 00:57:58.438
And again, and again.

999
00:57:59.606 --> 00:58:02.234
He also knows... that he loves you.

1000
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.778
But he's conflicted.

1001
00:58:05.862 --> 00:58:08.240
Because he knows
that the person he loves...


1002
00:58:08.865 --> 00:58:11.326
is the one who's going to make
the bad thing happen.


1003
00:58:13.954 --> 00:58:16.540
It's like Stockholm syndrome
meets <i>Groundhog Day.</i>


1004
00:58:19.417 --> 00:58:21.128
Here's what's even more fucked-up.

1005
00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:23.004
Ten minutes later...

1006
00:58:23.797 --> 00:58:25.173
you need another hit.

1007
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.177
You're just coming down off your high,

1008
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:32.597
you're, like, "I gotta go to
the grocery store. I've got a callback..."


1009
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:34.975
Who's the baby?

1010
00:58:35.934 --> 00:58:38.812
This time he doesn't remember.
He's, like, "I don't know!


1011
00:58:39.855 --> 00:58:41.940
I don't know. Why don't I remember?"

1012
00:58:42.023 --> 00:58:44.276
You're getting closer. 
Who's the baby?

1013
00:58:45.193 --> 00:58:46.278
"I don't know."

1014
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:50.699
The dog's having very blurry flashbacks
of teeth, and kisses, and belly rubs.


1015
00:58:50.782 --> 00:58:52.409
It's like <i>Westworld</i>for dogs.

1016
00:58:54.619 --> 00:58:55.912
Who's the baby?

1017
00:58:55.996 --> 00:58:59.708
"I don't know! Leave me alone!"
Who's the baby?


1018
00:58:59.791 --> 00:59:01.751
"I don't know! 
I don't know who the..."

1019
00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:05.005
He looks down at his arm
and there's a tattooÂ that just says...


1020
00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:07.674
"You're the baby."

1021
00:59:09.843 --> 00:59:10.927
You're the baby.

1022
00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:21.313
So, I'm getting married.

1023
00:59:22.856 --> 00:59:26.151
One of the lovely things
about the man that I'm marrying is that


1024
00:59:26.234 --> 00:59:29.863
he has never asked me to change
anything about myself.


1025
00:59:29.946 --> 00:59:31.823
This is a very weird job.

1026
00:59:31.907 --> 00:59:33.200
We're on a ship.

1027
00:59:33.283 --> 00:59:35.869
I'm telling jokes.
Those things don't go together.


1028
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:41.291
He's always been respectful of my job,
he's never asked that I not go,


1029
00:59:41.374 --> 00:59:43.793
not go to work, that
I not take a gig.

1030
00:59:44.294 --> 00:59:47.297
The only thing he's ever asked
that I not do


1031
00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.217
was a couple of weeks ago,
we were getting ready for bed,


1032
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.928
and I came out, dressed,
and he looked at me and went,


1033
00:59:53.011 --> 00:59:53.970
"Babe.

1034
00:59:54.763 --> 00:59:55.597
Love you.

1035
00:59:58.475 --> 01:00:01.561
Can you <i>not</i> wear men's basketball shorts
to bed?"


1036
01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:07.567
And I was, like,
"Interesting request. Proceed."


1037
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.029
He goes, "Uh...

1038
01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:13.365
Love you. Think you're beautiful.

1039
01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:18.745
It's just that...
I'm not as attracted to you


1040
01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:21.623
and I don't really want
to have sex with you...


1041
01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:24.459
when you're in men's basketball shorts."

1042
01:00:25.335 --> 01:00:26.586
I was, like, "Oh...

1043
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.129
that's the idea!

1044
01:00:28.213 --> 01:00:29.756
Thanks for the ring, fucker!"

1045
01:00:47.524 --> 01:00:49.859
He's sitting in the back, like,
"We fuck. I mean..."


1046
01:00:53.947 --> 01:00:56.449
My dad's also here
so that was a weird take, so...


1047
01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:03.999
A big part of getting married
is you have to buy a wedding dress.


1048
01:01:04.082 --> 01:01:07.877
And this is just one more milestone
in our lives as women


1049
01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:10.755
where other women don't clue us in

1050
01:01:10.839 --> 01:01:13.800
on how terrible it actually is.

1051
01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:18.054
We say we're girls' girls and feminists,
but none of us, like, give the truth


1052
01:01:18.138 --> 01:01:19.389
about girl things.

1053
01:01:19.472 --> 01:01:23.435
We act like it's sugar and spice, IÂ keep
my cereals in canisters like a psycho,


1054
01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.353
I'm doing it, yoga. Okay.

1055
01:01:26.229 --> 01:01:28.315
Everything, every big thing in
a woman's life.


1056
01:01:28.398 --> 01:01:31.151
Oh, you had your period?
Welcome to being a woman.


1057
01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:34.529
There's no homegirl, like,
"You're gonna wanna rip out your ovaries,


1058
01:01:34.612 --> 01:01:36.865
and hate your body,
and you're gonna cry.


1059
01:01:36.948 --> 01:01:40.452
You're gonna want a lot of chocolate.
Probably not even go to school.


1060
01:01:40.535 --> 01:01:43.246
Your skin's gonna break out. Welcome
to womanhood. Get in the game."


1061
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.748
They don't say that, okay?

1062
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:48.626
You're having a baby?
Oh, it's so beautiful.


1063
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.378
"Come here. You're gonna shit yourself.

1064
01:01:52.756 --> 01:01:56.092
Then society's gonna judge you 'cause
you didn't get your body back like that."


1065
01:01:59.554 --> 01:02:01.931
"You're getting a wedding dress?
Oh, it's so magical.


1066
01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:04.684
So magical. You show up.

1067
01:02:05.101 --> 01:02:06.644
It's so magical. You show up.

1068
01:02:06.728 --> 01:02:09.439
Your mother is there.
She doesn't tell you you look tired.


1069
01:02:11.066 --> 01:02:14.903
You've lost so much weight,
every dress just cascades off of you.


1070
01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:18.698
A modeling coach walks by and says,
'She's too beautiful for the runway.'


1071
01:02:18.782 --> 01:02:21.743
You stand there.
Your best friends are there, and they...


1072
01:02:21.826 --> 01:02:23.453
And none of them are jealous.

1073
01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:27.332
And a dove brings you
the perfect silken... and it just..."


1074
01:02:27.415 --> 01:02:31.086
No. It's you standing there
at a dress shop in West Hollywood


1075
01:02:31.169 --> 01:02:33.713
with your mom on FaceTime asking you
how FaceTime works.


1076
01:02:33.797 --> 01:02:36.257
Just use the button!
Ask somebody near you!


1077
01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:38.927
There's some Russian seamstress
at the bottom, like,


1078
01:02:39.052 --> 01:02:41.554
"Your hips are too wide for this cut.
You should not try it on."


1079
01:02:42.597 --> 01:02:45.767
Then you go eat Chick-fil-A.
Like, that's buying a wedding dress.


1080
01:02:46.768 --> 01:02:49.270
So, I was trying on wedding dresses,
and I figured


1081
01:02:49.354 --> 01:02:51.356
I should go with a big princess dress,

1082
01:02:51.439 --> 01:02:55.360
because that's the chance to wear it,
so I put it on, and I come out...


1083
01:02:56.736 --> 01:02:59.447
and I realize, if that's the kind of dress
you wear,


1084
01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:03.368
if you extrapolate your wedding dress
from the actual day...


1085
01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:05.703
you're dressed like a lunatic.

1086
01:03:07.622 --> 01:03:11.459
For, like, deeply disturbing
psychological reasons.


1087
01:03:11.543 --> 01:03:13.586
You're, like, "I'm a pretty princess.

1088
01:03:15.588 --> 01:03:19.676
I'm a pr... "No, you're Gaby,
and you work in HR. You are not a pr...


1089
01:03:19.759 --> 01:03:21.970
"No, I'm a pretty princess."

1090
01:03:22.053 --> 01:03:26.349
And all of your maids have to agree
with you, like, "Yes, fairest of all."


1091
01:03:27.642 --> 01:03:31.563
"I'm a pr... I'm a ballerina princess!
'Cause I've got Arena shoes.


1092
01:03:31.646 --> 01:03:34.274
'Cause I'm Daddy's ballerina.
I'm a pretty princess.


1093
01:03:34.357 --> 01:03:36.484
Bring me Snow White's heart on a platter."

1094
01:03:44.617 --> 01:03:49.038
So I'm trying all different dresses, and
there's this weird phenomenon with women,


1095
01:03:49.122 --> 01:03:51.624
when you try on more than three articles
of clothing.


1096
01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:54.002
There is no fourth. 
You just start crying.

1097
01:03:54.752 --> 01:03:57.797
There's something about incandescent
lighting hitting your fat cells


1098
01:03:57.881 --> 01:04:00.508
that actually makes them multiply
on the spot.


1099
01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:04.429
You get angry. Do you ever do this move
where you hit your fat, hoping to pop it?


1100
01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:07.640
It doesn't. It just leaves a bruise,
then you can't wear shorts. So...


1101
01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:12.353
I started to get upset
and I did the mistake that all women do.


1102
01:04:12.437 --> 01:04:15.398
I started to get angry about something
on my body I couldn't control.


1103
01:04:15.482 --> 01:04:17.025
Every girl's got a thing

1104
01:04:17.108 --> 01:04:19.986
that she hates about herself
that's impossible to change.


1105
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:22.071
For me, I don't
like how tall I am.

1106
01:04:22.697 --> 01:04:25.283
That makes it sound like I'm tall.
I wish I were taller.


1107
01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:30.830
So tall. To you, like, "She's so tall."
'Cause I'm this big on your TV.


1108
01:04:30.914 --> 01:04:32.999
But I am 5'5".

1109
01:04:33.082 --> 01:04:34.626
And it kills me.

1110
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.964
It's not short enough that... "Do you shop
at Gap Kids? You're so petite!"


1111
01:04:40.048 --> 01:04:40.924
No.

1112
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:44.928
And it's not tall enough that
people assume I'm a natural athlete.


1113
01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:46.638
I'm just this average...

1114
01:04:46.721 --> 01:04:47.847
5'5"...

1115
01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:51.893
member of the proletariat
marching to pick a size 7 shoe.


1116
01:04:51.976 --> 01:04:52.894
Like, it's just...

1117
01:04:54.896 --> 01:04:57.524
Anytime you tell another woman what you
don't like about yourself,


1118
01:04:57.607 --> 01:04:59.067
they never let you say it.

1119
01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:00.902
Oh, I'd kill to have your hair.

1120
01:05:00.985 --> 01:05:03.821
I'd kill to have your beak,
I love your feathers. It's like...


1121
01:05:06.783 --> 01:05:11.663
So, I'm sitting there, getting ready
to pick out a dress for my wedding,


1122
01:05:11.746 --> 01:05:12.747
and I was angry.

1123
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:16.084
That's not an emotion you want
to attach... to your wedding.


1124
01:05:16.167 --> 01:05:19.921
I started to feel sad, and, for me,
when I get upset about something,


1125
01:05:20.004 --> 01:05:23.091
I attach it to literally everything else
in my life.


1126
01:05:23.174 --> 01:05:24.259
And it spirals.

1127
01:05:24.342 --> 01:05:27.554
It's not about the dress,
it's about how I feel about the dress,


1128
01:05:27.637 --> 01:05:31.266
it's how I feel about me,Â I'll marry
my dog, we'll live in the woods!


1129
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:33.351
Like, it just goes, like that.

1130
01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:37.146
Started to get real angry about my body
'cause it wasn't fitting perfectly


1131
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.023
into the right dress that I wanted.

1132
01:05:39.107 --> 01:05:41.818
I stopped and was, like,
"If I'm feeling this way right now,


1133
01:05:41.901 --> 01:05:44.070
there's gotta be other women
who feel this way."


1134
01:05:44.153 --> 01:05:48.283
So I'm going to say this 'cause I wish
I'd given myself this pep talk that day.


1135
01:05:48.575 --> 01:05:49.409
Here's the truth.

1136
01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:52.036
Girls, your bodies are perfect...

1137
01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:53.288
and normal...

1138
01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:56.082
and functional... and beautiful.

1139
01:05:56.624 --> 01:05:59.544
There's always one girl in back
with a horn. "What about me?"


1140
01:05:59.627 --> 01:06:00.712
No.

1141
01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:02.547
Not you!

1142
01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:04.507
Shave it.

1143
01:06:06.009 --> 01:06:07.010
Quit following me.

1144
01:06:09.679 --> 01:06:13.850
But we've been brainwashed into trying
to live up to this Instagram Photoshop


1145
01:06:13.933 --> 01:06:15.518
example of what beauty is.

1146
01:06:15.602 --> 01:06:17.854
And some girls do look like that.
Fuck them.


1147
01:06:17.937 --> 01:06:21.524
No, some girls do. There's always
something you don't like.


1148
01:06:21.608 --> 01:06:23.401
We have to stop faulting ourselves

1149
01:06:23.484 --> 01:06:25.278
for things that are very normal.

1150
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:28.573
"I've got cellulite. What if he doesn't
want to have sex with me


1151
01:06:28.656 --> 01:06:30.283
'cause I have cellulite?"

1152
01:06:30.366 --> 01:06:33.786
Well, 100% of women
have some form of cellulite.


1153
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:36.497
If he doesn't want to fuck you
'cause you got cellulite,


1154
01:06:36.623 --> 01:06:38.541
he'd better start fucking dudes, 'cause...

1155
01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:42.629
there's no other option till the robots
take over.


1156
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.342
Moreover, he doesn't want
to have that conversation.


1157
01:06:47.759 --> 01:06:49.510
A guy doesn't find it attractive

1158
01:06:49.594 --> 01:06:52.597
when you verbalize over and over
how much you hate something.


1159
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.474
"But my cellulite? 
I showed it to you."

1160
01:06:54.557 --> 01:06:57.560
Look at that. I'll make a face out of it."
He doesn't...


1161
01:06:57.644 --> 01:06:59.937
The conversation he wants to have
is the following.


1162
01:07:00.021 --> 01:07:01.105
"Let me ask you a question.

1163
01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:04.942
Are you going to continue to breathe
during intercourse?"


1164
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:08.404
You're, like, "Yeah, I was planning
on it."


1165
01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:09.989
He's, like, "Then we're cool.

1166
01:07:12.492 --> 01:07:13.910
That holds up in court...

1167
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:17.288
I found out."

1168
01:07:18.956 --> 01:07:21.584
But I've got this, and chub,
and I don't like my arms.


1169
01:07:21.668 --> 01:07:24.754
And I have stretch marks,
from growing from an infant!


1170
01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:31.260
And I don't want to be this hand-holding,
like, "Every woman is perfect."


1171
01:07:31.344 --> 01:07:34.180
Look, you might not be perfect, okay.

1172
01:07:34.263 --> 01:07:37.058
I'm not here to judge that,
if you're not, if you are.


1173
01:07:37.141 --> 01:07:40.687
What I say is it's up to you to decide
how much you love your body.


1174
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.815
Fuck everybody else. Don't fuck them...
Not literally. But...


1175
01:07:44.524 --> 01:07:46.693
if it makes you feel good!
It probably won't.


1176
01:07:47.944 --> 01:07:51.447
It's up for you to decide, because
we get so upset, and you know what?


1177
01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:55.535
The guy you like probably isn't even
going to notice the thing you hate.


1178
01:07:55.618 --> 01:07:56.911
Most people won't.

1179
01:07:56.994 --> 01:07:57.870
Men won't.

1180
01:07:57.954 --> 01:08:02.083
Most of the things, a guy is not going
to notice. They're not that observant.


1181
01:08:03.626 --> 01:08:05.920
40% of men
can only see three colors.


1182
01:08:08.923 --> 01:08:11.676
40% of the men here
don't know that that's red.


1183
01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:15.096
Notice it's a hollow laugh.

1184
01:08:16.848 --> 01:08:19.308
40% of the men are, like,
"Hah! Oh, fuck.


1185
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.647
Siri, what is red?"

1186
01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:32.613
And, again, you might have a perfect body.
You might not have a great body.


1187
01:08:32.697 --> 01:08:34.866
I don't know what you got
under that tarp.


1188
01:08:34.949 --> 01:08:39.120
You could have... blown out the whole
region with a bad wax strip, I don't know.


1189
01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:43.291
But I do know is this.
Whatever you have as a woman,


1190
01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:45.585
whatever your body looks like, girls.

1191
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.795
However bad you think it is

1192
01:08:47.879 --> 01:08:50.840
pales in comparison to the look

1193
01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:53.760
of 100% of...

1194
01:08:54.469 --> 01:08:55.386
scrotums!

1195
01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:57.972
What is that?

1196
01:08:58.723 --> 01:09:00.516
What the fuck is that?

1197
01:09:02.769 --> 01:09:06.105
Why is this not the topic
of every State of the Union address?


1198
01:09:06.856 --> 01:09:10.067
Why is this... how come...
my thighs can't touch,


1199
01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:14.280
but you have two dead baby birds,
hanging.


1200
01:09:16.407 --> 01:09:18.451
Sir, bat-like. Hanging.

1201
01:09:19.744 --> 01:09:23.206
Sometimes so low,
they're in the toilet water.


1202
01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:25.208
Hanging.

1203
01:09:27.168 --> 01:09:31.088
Every guy here is laughing, smiling,
or not making eye contact with me.


1204
01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:37.386
Because it's never occurred to men
to question their bodies.


1205
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:41.098
Every guy is, like, "Why wouldn't you want
this on your face for free?"


1206
01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:45.978
If we are to move forward as women,
as feminists,


1207
01:09:46.062 --> 01:09:51.150
we need to decide we won't be shamed
for what our bodies look naturally either.


1208
01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:54.862
And just so you know, gentlemen.
It's something that we tolerate.


1209
01:09:54.946 --> 01:09:57.448
But it's not something
that we fantasize about.


1210
01:09:58.449 --> 01:10:01.452
It's just the way it is,
so we never really question it.


1211
01:10:01.536 --> 01:10:04.914
But no woman growing up was, like,
"This is my Backstreet Boys poster.


1212
01:10:04.997 --> 01:10:05.957
This is NSYNC.

1213
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.209
And this is a nut
sack!" Like, none of us!

1214
01:10:11.379 --> 01:10:14.507
It's hideous and, I'll tell youÂ something
else, it's a little traumatizing.


1215
01:10:15.341 --> 01:10:17.260
'Cause we put effort
into the way we look.

1216
01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:19.929
And we're sitting in bed,
waiting for you to come out,


1217
01:10:20.012 --> 01:10:23.182
just like you have every night,
and you come out the bathroom naked.


1218
01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:26.519
You look at us, and we look at you,
like, "Oh, god, there it is."


1219
01:10:27.812 --> 01:10:30.648
Who's the baby?

1220
01:10:31.107 --> 01:10:34.902
Thank you so much for coming out tonight
to have a good time. Thank you.
