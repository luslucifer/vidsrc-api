33
00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.949
but lets get out of the holidays family.

34
00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:23.199
Why?

35
00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:26.118
Because we are a family.

36
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.034

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:35.911
Noah, eats cereal more slowly.

41
00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:39.204
Sin shores of new Medusa.

42
00:02:39.287 --> 00:02:40.748

43
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.498

Good, family.

48
00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.505
As a matter of fact, I
was on the way to go.


49
00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:07.795
But first must not eat something.

50

64
00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:43.931
"I do not want my

65
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:46.016
-Lison! 
-Lison!

66
00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:47.642
That was nice news that

67
00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:49.099
Tom, you have a trap?

68
00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:51.600

Will be just a few days.

76
00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:32.530
He has been traveling together with his
girlfriend, it to the left, and he needs help.


77
00:04:32.613 --> 00:04:34.655
When you hired as an assistant,

78
00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:37.531

you for a few days.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.408
an assistant very competent.

81
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:46.200
I have not forced to resign
from the competent Natacha.


82
00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:51.160
I had the courage to make him to choose
between his wife and a harlot That.


83
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.619
And we have not chosen?

84
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.537
Do you have chosen?

85
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.328
You have chosen your father.

86
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.538
Good morning. Good morning.

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.289

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:09.872
Will not do anything. 
Children help me.

91
00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:11.456
You see, forget it."

92
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:13.582
Come on!

93
00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.252

94
00:05:25.503 --> 00:05:26.920

95
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:28.587
Sin.

96
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:30.586
He has slipped out of his hand.

97
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.130
Arrange check, has got rid almost!

98
00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:36.631

100
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.381
I gave it to him now?

101
00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:43.050
Of course, and say it was my fault.

102
00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.926
Will not make to pass through
the boring, too easily.


103
00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.610
But of course not. I will tell you
that we have changed the plans.


104
00:05:48.635 --> 00:05:51.552
Santa is already high, he will understand.

105
00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:52.969
Please!

106
00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:57.304
Is she insane?

107

Not why would I be? well. and then?

108

Yes. 
-Wonderful.

110
00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:06.640
I told him and he understood.

111
00:06:06.722 --> 00:06:08.139
- What did you say?" I said.

112
00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:09.473
And still go?

113
00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:12.266
Yes, go to the beach with children

114
00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:14.268

And me! And me!

173

We saw a sort of Kombi green?

00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:36.669
Think they forgot me here.

199
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.545
How to remember? well ...

200
00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:42.171
I went to the head d'
Agde with my mother.

201
00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:44.211
It has stopped for the gas,

202
00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:48.754
I went to pee and then ...

203
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:53.132
it had gone without me... I think.

204
00:12:54.049 --> 00:12:55.756
Has not called her?

205
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.216

I return to the Paris.

296
00:17:59.927 --> 00:18:02.220
All due to a name?

297

Does not comply with nothing. has
been our secret, you betrayed me.

Yes, we are on vacation!

303
00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:16.057
What do I do?

304
00:18:16.892 --> 00:18:18.892
Ben.

305
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.183
Sit down, please.

306
00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:23.269
Sit at my place, so that they can
speak without needing to sun.


307
00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.770
No, I would prefer to stay
here if there is an accident.


308
00:18:26.853 --> 00:18:29.311
Comes, nobody will change places. Relax.

309
00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:31.646
I can concentrate on the road.

310
00:18:52.192 --> 00:18:55.193
Is something we can do without
to include your father?"


311
00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:57.569
I have nothing against you, Ben.

312
00:18:57.654 --> 00:18:59.612
When you were born, and there was no.

315
00:19:03.988 --> 00:19:07.281

316
00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:08.407
E my father.

317

It has not been.

319
00:19:11.616 --> 00:19:14.491
And when i ...

320
00:19:14.573 --> 00:19:16.949

323
00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:23.452
When we are generating children!
Thank You, Lison.


324
00:19:24.536 --> 00:19:27.537
The generation of children,
it has not been.


325
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.538
Both times he was at home!

326
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:31.329
They have abandoned that a stocking old.

327
00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:33.664
Yes, have abandoned that a stocking old.

328

Help us without assistance. Ten
Years of psychology for this?


333
00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:49.919
And you, ten years of medicine in order
to correct the nose and eliminate fat?


334
00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:51.544
Of course, it straight!

335
00:19:54.253 --> 00:19:57.379
Julia, I forgot who is calling Gaspard.

336
00:19:57.921 --> 00:19:59.921
I am sorry that
I told our little secret.

337
00:20:00.004 --> 00:20:01.922
We are all nervous, we need ...

338
00:20:02.005 --> 00:20:04.089
ride by bicycle, which is.

339
00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:06.173
Is a reason.

340
00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:09.215
Let me to the base station
in Paris, with children


341
00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:12.008
and go cycling together with his father.

342
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.483
In the case in which
passes through the Paris,


343
00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:15.967
may deviate from Chateaudun?

344
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:17.842
Stay with a friend.

345
00:20:17.927 --> 00:20:21.303
Father, if shut your mouth,
this would not be happening.


346
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:22.719
, if you please

347
00:20:22.803 --> 00:20:24.136
way to boca.

348
00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:26.886
Does not come, this is very easy.

349
00:20:26.969 --> 00:20:29.095
How can you talk to me so, Tom?

350
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:35.182
My friend left me, 
I feel vulnerable.

351
00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.348
What are you talking about?

352
00:20:37.432 --> 00:20:40.723
He lived for three weeks with her. did
not know even the name or family.


353
00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:45.725
And outlet, Tom?

354
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.643
Let us go back, do you know that?

355
00:21:00.522 --> 00:21:01.939
Is a madness!

356
00:21:02.022 --> 00:21:03.815
Is nothing.

357
00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.532
No longer rule that, Tom.

358
00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:45.785
You're insane!

359
00:22:09.042 --> 00:22:11.334
I have a small problem ...

360
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:12.918
I do not know what happens.

361
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.336
Are caught. machine
accelerates, but refuses


362
00:22:17.876 --> 00:22:19.127
deceleration.

363
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.502
Brake 
-OS. -already braked.

364
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.046
This joke, Tom.

365
00:22:23.128 --> 00:22:24.920
Brake, pull on the road
and we will be back.


366
00:22:24.921 --> 00:22:26.922
Is not a joke. are caught.

367
00:22:27.004 --> 00:22:30.465
But what caught?" -the rate controller.

368
00:22:30.548 --> 00:22:31.756
What is this?"

369
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.256
is a thing which controls the speed.

370
00:22:35.341 --> 00:22:38.342
Is this button, which makes the
machine maintains the same speed,


371
00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:40.259
but cannot stop.

372
00:22:40.343 --> 00:22:42.651
Why pressed the button at the
top did not know what was it?


373
00:22:42.676 --> 00:22:44.885
I know what he was doing,
but does not work!


374
00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:47.010
"Speed Control cruise". well ...

375
00:22:47.095 --> 00:22:49.010
"Turn off the cruise control:

376
00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:51.386
system is automatically
disabled when braking. "


377
00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:54.097
that I said. brake
I, but does not disable.

378
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.097
"Or on the exchange in neutral."

379
00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:00.889
system failure.

380
00:23:00.974 --> 00:23:02.139
Stop vehicle.

381
00:23:04.475 --> 00:23:07.515
- the previous machine didn't.
No, I have not done it.


382
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.976
Also has not had the airbag. my parents
were not even safety belts from the rear.


383
00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:14.102
Grandparents my paternal
grandparents had no engine.


384
00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:16.311
It is called progress. is that so?"

385
00:23:16.393 --> 00:23:20.311
and block the machine to 130 km/h.
What is wrong with her to purchase?


386
00:23:20.394 --> 00:23:23.105
Mother, don't be angry,
it is bad for baby.

387
00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:25.814
Is so, honey. you crossed the line, Tom.

388
00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:29.022
With scalpel, you destroyed
the nature and common sense.


389
00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:32.648
We don't, also a liposuctie,

390
00:23:32.733 --> 00:23:34.273
and a small facelift.

391
00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:37.275
, and also, I make Reconstructive surgery.

392
00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:40.318
Are too warm. Can I go now?

393
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.525
Mother, have someone near the grandfather!

394
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.611
A qu?

395
00:23:43.651 --> 00:23:45.236
Very funny, Noah.

396
00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:46.695
Hear voices, doc?

397
00:23:46.777 --> 00:23:48.777
Hello!

398
00:23:50.403 --> 00:23:51.738
Who is that girl?

399
00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:54.322
Who are you?" Ben, what is it?

400
00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:56.404
True, who is?

401
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.280
Hell, Daddy, who is that girl?

402
00:23:58.365 --> 00:24:01.991
Melody, who is a great friend of mine.
Poupard Melody.


403
00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:03.533
- and when it has gone? -when?

404
00:24:03.617 --> 00:24:05.532
When? at the station of gas.

405
00:24:06.407 --> 00:24:09.658
If you wish, you can pay the tax.

406
00:24:09.743 --> 00:24:11.159
You know, not?

407
00:24:11.244 --> 00:24:12.409
Of course not!

408
00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:14.578
I can let the next stop.

409
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.827
Arrangement I.

410
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.286
Tom and Julia SAO very altruistic.

411
00:24:18.371 --> 00:24:20.371
They will not leave a single young.

412
00:24:20.454 --> 00:24:22.622
And has a vacant place near me.

413
00:24:22.705 --> 00:24:25.456
Right, everything. Silence, Zen status.

414
00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:27.538
Fantastic!

415
00:24:26.581 --> 00:24:28.581
Is quiet?

416
00:24:27.498 --> 00:24:30.207
Your father is not
alone. at the next stop,

417
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:32.165
Take it and Ben.

418
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.475
If you do not want to leave him,
you can go into the bottom, also.


419
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.416
Or I go down with the children.

420
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:38.167
Is not my friend.

421
00:24:38.252 --> 00:24:40.417
So what she was doing there?

422
00:24:40.502 --> 00:24:42.128
But it may become my friend.

423
00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:44.129
Who cares?

424
00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:47.129
Tom, stop it, will you?

425
00:24:47.212 --> 00:24:48.963
Por favor, seems agora.

426
00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:50.087
SIM card, it seems.

427
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.170
I will not disturb.

428
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.006
Stop, Tom, I will
go down with the melody.

429
00:24:54.089 --> 00:24:56.089
Tom, seems!

430
00:24:55.089 --> 00:24:56.382
Seems papai!

431
00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:58.048
Stop sending i halt!

432
00:24:58.132 --> 00:25:00.633
Does not have no control of
anything, I cannot stop.


433
00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:02.634
Cruise control locked.

434
00:25:02.717 --> 00:25:04.634
The cruise control is dead!

435
00:25:04.717 --> 00:25:06.176
Good trip, Tom Cox.

436
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.260
Way!

437
00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:08.968
De jure, Tom. Swear by it.

438
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.050
Around.

439
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.219
No, look at me, and around.

440
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.344
May not... I lead.

441
00:25:13.427 --> 00:25:14.802
But... around.

442
00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:16.678
Do no longer believe in you.

443
00:25:16.763 --> 00:25:19.013
Gaspard swear that I may stop.

444
00:25:19.014 --> 00:25:21.015
Will no longer be called Gaspard.

445
00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:22.822
Swear on your ministering
kinsfolk around her!


446
00:25:22.847 --> 00:25:24.265
Around on his belly.

447
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.266
And if the step on the
accelerator pedal and menus?


448
00:25:29.349 --> 00:25:30.767
Does not slow down, it
will also not accelerate.


449
00:25:30.768 --> 00:25:32.768
You need to accelerate to unlock.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.476
Accelerating the background

-Bombeie pedal.

457
00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:02.651
- Very good. Great. 
-Bravo.

458
00:26:03.984 --> 00:26:05.235
More slowly.

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.779
- the previous machine has had the brake.
but not that.


463
00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:16.071
Don't talk to me so.

464
00:26:16.155 --> 00:26:18.989
Excuse me, cute.

465
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:21.071
Miau.

466
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:24.739
Only... e only ...

467
00:26:24.822 --> 00:26:26.698
"e, e only" what?

468
00:26:26.783 --> 00:26:28.158
Cut the ignition.

469
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:29.825
It is locked. Everything is locked.

470
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:32.742
Machine has gone mad. 
A new car, damn!

471
00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:35.242
Tom is a car, and the machines stop.

00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:45.204
Tom, slowly, please.

477
00:26:45.288 --> 00:26:47.169
We will not come back,

478
00:26:47.204 --> 00:26:49.789
Melody sleeps in the living
room, we would pancakes,


479
00:26:49.872 --> 00:26:52.290

00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:01.543
Nobody will die.

Take, dial the number.

497
00:27:38.428 --> 00:27:40.387
I call.

498
00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:45.305

499
00:27:45.388 --> 00:27:49.973
for another euro lead air
conditioning, alloy wheel rims


500
00:27:50.057 --> 00:27:52.848
regulator and speed!

501
00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:56.392
Everything for less than 100

502
00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:59.224
Excuse me.

503
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.560
Danieli The Danjoon.

504
00:28:01.643 --> 00:28:04.602
Dl Danieli is Tom Cox. I
bought a Medusa last week.


505
00:28:04.686 --> 00:28:06.686
I wanted to know one thing.

506
00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:08.312
How can I turn off the speed controller?

507
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:09.687
Stop.

508
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.063
Stopped in automatic mode.

509
00:28:11.146 --> 00:28:12.354
I thought this.

510
00:28:12.438 --> 00:28:16.314
Half an hour ago Are
brakes but does not work.


511
00:28:17.523 --> 00:28:21.232
Are you sure that you do not step
on the clutch instead of the brake?


512
00:28:22.606 --> 00:28:24.649
Is a car automatic transmission.

513
00:28:24.732 --> 00:28:26.732
Clutch Not.

514
00:28:25.817 --> 00:28:29.193
There is a foreign
body, a bad carpet on,

515
00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:31.319
to affect the pedal operation?

516
00:28:31.402 --> 00:28:33.652
For a long time there is
no electronic controllers.


517
00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:36.360
Sir Danieli, are at maximum

00:28:37.945 --> 00:28:40.321
And you cheated me with that package damn

520
00:28:40.404 --> 00:28:42.030
speed control.

521
00:28:42.112 --> 00:28:43.822
We were not mistaken, d them.

522
00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:46.781
Deceived, yes, Sir Danieli.
E a son of a bitch!


523
00:28:46.863 --> 00:28:49.739
Well, turn off the cruise control function,

524
00:28:49.824 --> 00:28:52.283
stop at a rest
area, stretch the legs and

525
00:28:52.284 --> 00:28:54.284
relax with family.

526
00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:55.408

Yes, of course, a sandwich.

530
00:29:08.954 --> 00:29:10.954
What did he say?

531
00:29:13.164 --> 00:29:14.539
To brake.

532
00:29:15.456 --> 00:29:17.456
Free!

533
00:29:36.127 --> 00:29:38.463
Dad, sit here in front of her.

Mother!

542
00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:07.304
Mother ...

543
00:30:09.472 --> 00:30:12.181
I am glad that I have not seen it.
More than that, we cannot stop.


544
00:30:12.263 --> 00:30:14.388
Dad, I asked you feel in the face!

545
00:30:14.931 --> 00:30:16.099

And you haven't. mythomaniac

What is this?"

00:30:55.443 --> 00:30:56.735
You are a cult?

565
00:30:56.818 --> 00:30:59.277
Is a collective suicide?
Everything will starts over?

- Don't. How we do with tax?

666
00:38:51.955 --> 00:38:54.289
How are we going

00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:56.832

This research may discover.

673
00:39:10.585 --> 00:39:13.586

He told us, no one else will save.

675
00:39:15.837 --> 00:39:18.255
There is no negative thoughts, but we lost.

00:39:18.338 --> 00:39:21.172
But he's not smarter Crew.

677
00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:24.381
Officer is an expert and will save us.
Repeat, Tom.

00:39:24.464 --> 00:39:26.548
Is so, honey. the officer is an expert.

679
00:39:26.632 --> 00:39:29.841

00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:31.984
- Tom, "the Nazi," he said.
Do Not, he said "expert".


681

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.053
- Chega, father, you're insane. Pope

684
00:39:42.137 --> 00:39:44.762

"I do not think so, captain. -and then?

713
00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:01.367

Do not think of anything.

735
00:42:09.762 --> 00:42:11.095
Do not look to the obstacle.

736
00:42:11.179 --> 00:42:13.513
Secure at the furthest point, okay?

737

Or close your eyes and invokes force.

738

It is a real jewel of technology.

841
00:49:06.859 --> 00:49:09.650

881
00:51:38.435 --> 00:51:41.142
Yes, and perhaps I got more
quickly to the mortuary.


882
00:51:41.226 --> 00:51:43.351
Mortuary? What is the mortuary, Dad?

883
00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:45.475
To put an end to naked in refrigerators.

884
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.598
None of that. The mortuary is when ...

Sir, are you all right?

890
00:52:08.009 --> 00:52:10.717
Sir, can you hear me?

891

Well, captain. Understood.

902
00:53:01.117 --> 00:53:03.116
How are we going to do
with the traffic jam?


903
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.283
How to spend?

Is the artist below. 
There is a leak.

991
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.289
Leaking? where coming?

992
00:57:06.372 --> 00:57:08.287
Indeed? What is leaking?

993
00:57:08.371 --> 00:57:10.162
Those who takes time to take a shower,

994
00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:12.411
this hobo chic, with emphasis false.

995
00:57:12.953 --> 00:57:16.077
Stop vehicle.

996
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.451
Juan? We can not do anything, travel.

997
00:57:18.534 --> 00:57:19.784
We have a serious problem.

998
00:57:19.868 --> 00:57:23.449
Why to call Juan? -why,
it is not called Juan?


999
00:57:24.157 --> 00:57:27.323
Good trip, Tom Cox.

1000
00:57:27.406 --> 00:57:29.530
Are in the car with my family.

1001
00:57:29.614 --> 00:57:31.405
Leak comes from our house?

1002
00:57:31.489 --> 00:57:36.587
He said that "we could see. 
Only remained with the tables, 1009 media

1003
00:57:36.612 --> 00:57:39.861
Are my husband and
my children in the car.

1004
00:57:39.944 --> 00:57:41.777
Can do nothing for you.

1005
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:43.693
Have to see you again, Julia. 
-Juan!

1006
00:57:43.776 --> 00:57:46.317
Must find a solution in alone.

1007
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.899
What he called on
the phone? Let me see.

1008
00:57:48.983 --> 00:57:51.898
Not, is my phone! Is my phone! Tom!

1009
00:57:51.982 --> 00:57:54.065
I must see it again, Julia.

1010
00:57:54.148 --> 00:57:56.148
Everything. phone 
-My!

1011
00:57:55.231 --> 00:57:57.688
Their forms, buttocks ...

1012
00:57:57.771 --> 00:58:01.020
her breasts that French, Julia.

1013
00:58:01.104 --> 00:58:03.020
-Devolva! Look, see on your mobile phone!

1014
00:58:03.104 --> 00:58:05.478
What? No, no! -ready!

1015
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.143
Julia?

1016
00:58:11.642 --> 00:58:13.516
"your breasts that French"?

1017
00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:16.725
Is nothing.

1018
00:58:15.766 --> 00:58:17.766
Nothing?

1019
00:58:16.765 --> 00:58:18.307
And what is "Nothing"?

1020
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:19.639
Nothing ...

1021
00:58:19.723 --> 00:58:21.598
There is nothing, is not important.

1022
00:58:21.681 --> 00:58:24.055
So, old friend? 
Juan, which is this?

1023
00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:26.304
Show! Eyes on the
road. for a fixed point!

1024
00:58:26.387 --> 00:58:27.554
Breathe.

1025
00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.636
What is not? Nothing what?

1026
00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.803
Nothing is that ...

1027
00:58:32.177 --> 00:58:33.969
when you have done something with Natacha.

1028
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.384
- You did something with Juan?  After.

1029
00:58:37.468 --> 00:58:41.966
As with Natacha. Once each.
the ball is in the center.


1030
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:45.006
My friend school called Natacha.

1031
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.423
Well, my dear.

1032
00:58:48.464 --> 00:58:50.464
When it has been?

1033
00:58:49.547 --> 00:58:50.588
A qu?

1034
00:58:50.671 --> 00:58:51.713
"this! What?

1035
00:58:51.796 --> 00:58:53.796
Thing!

1036
00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:54.253
- the thing. Yes, work.

1037
00:58:55.003 --> 00:58:56.128
One year.

1038
00:58:56.212 --> 00:58:58.212
A year?

1039
00:58:57.127 --> 00:58:59.169
Hush, father! look ahead!

1040
00:58:59.252 --> 00:59:01.335
Concentre-be breathe!

1041
00:59:01.418 --> 00:59:05.959
"has not been as lasted for a year.
Has not been a year ago last summer.


1042
00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:09.248
Why they speak English? because
we do not speak Spanish.


1043
00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:20.704
But the child Gaspard ...

1044
00:59:20.787 --> 00:59:22.161
will no longer be called Gaspard.

1045
00:59:22.244 --> 00:59:25.035
Not telling me e Juan. 
-Vo it sun on Juan?

1046
00:59:25.118 --> 00:59:26.702
Please, Dad!

1047
00:59:28.992 --> 00:59:30.492
Don't be ridiculous.

1048
00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:35.199
Mother! it cannot stay, 
I need to pee.

1049
00:59:35.282 --> 00:59:37.823
Well... Ia.

1050
00:59:37.906 --> 00:59:40.156
- Make sure the
pee here, dear. Thank You.

1051
00:59:42.572 --> 00:59:45.071
To start the head Juan.

1052
00:59:45.154 --> 00:59:47.403
Daddy, is that I am jealous.

1053
00:59:51.277 --> 00:59:54.651
So I wanted me to come back to Paris?
This is your secret?


1054
00:59:54.734 --> 00:59:56.567
Lison, what is your secret mother?

1055
00:59:58.817 --> 00:59:59.857
Here, Mother.

1056
00:59:59.941 --> 01:00:01.649
Thank you, my dear.

1057
01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:09.313
I think not.

1058
01:00:11.146 --> 01:00:12.687
-SIM Card? 
-SR. Cox?

1059
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.436
- The Danieli Danjoon. O
put him on the speaker!


1060
01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:17.726
SIM Card?

1061
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.517
Sir Cox, I spoke to the technical
support and have been badly.


1062
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.474
The braking force is greater
than the engine power.


1063
01:00:25.558 --> 01:00:28.640
Should be in a position to stop the
vehicle in the case in which should stop.


1064
01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:30.514
Is only required to tell me to stop?

1065
01:00:30.597 --> 01:00:32.764
To do everything off.

1066
01:00:32.847 --> 01:00:35.346
Might be an error in the
electronic circuit,


1067
01:00:35.347 --> 01:00:37.346
but brakes are mechanical.

1068
01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:39.012
But not i stopped retard!

1069
01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:41.011
Dl Cox, lay in the bank

1070
01:00:41.094 --> 01:00:42.885
and press brake firmly.

1071
01:00:42.968 --> 01:00:46.176
It operates, the wheels will
lock up and will not roll.


1072
01:00:46.259 --> 01:00:47.759
Yes! 
-Not.

1073
01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:49.675
Wheels will not relock.

1074
01:00:49.758 --> 01:00:52.007
There is a system of anti on wheels

1075
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:56.131
All models of the series
Medusa, Stresa, Flippa,


1076
01:00:56.214 --> 01:00:57.964
less on Calvary does not matter.

1077
01:00:58.048 --> 01:01:02.337
We understand that every second I
came back from a certain death?


1078
01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:04.836
Is the time to advertise this car

1079
01:01:04.837 --> 01:01:07.836
and optional electronic?

1080
01:01:07.919 --> 01:01:10.959
Thank You. only need to stop everything,

1081
01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.043
and finish.

1082
01:01:13.126 --> 01:01:14.750
Well...

1083
01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:16.667
he understood the maneuver, Dad?

1084
01:01:19.499 --> 01:01:21.498
Vamos free.

1085
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:23.997
Wait!

1086
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:26.704
ABS light lit!

1087
01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:29.495
Means that the anti-lock braking system

1088
01:01:29.496 --> 01:01:31.496
is inactive.

1089
01:01:30.578 --> 01:01:31.953
- and then? -and then?

1090
01:01:32.037 --> 01:01:35.660
Then it can be stopped.
If you stop to 160 km/h;


1091
01:01:35.743 --> 01:01:37.660
vehicle will transform and roll.

1092
01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:39.950
And then?

1093
01:01:40.034 --> 01:01:41.949
As tested by our impact,

1094
01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:44.241
she has a minimum chance of escape..

1095
01:01:44.324 --> 01:01:48.947
Do you mean?" No, sir Cox.

1096
01:01:51.405 --> 01:01:55.654
Bottling of 40km

1097
01:01:56.362 --> 01:01:58.236
It flashes!

1098
01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:00.361
The light has gone out!

1099
01:02:00.444 --> 01:02:02.860
Perhaps Anti-lock brake
system to be restored,


1100
01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:08.191
or may be an error by the panel
in this case, nothing changed.


1101
01:02:08.275 --> 01:02:09.815
Now depends on you.

1102
01:02:09.899 --> 01:02:12.732
- And what did
you do? are with you.

1103
01:02:12.815 --> 01:02:14.523
But what you do, stupid?

1104
01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:15.856
Well, sir Cox ...

1105
01:02:15.939 --> 01:02:19.479
I must confess that today
I do not feel very well.


1106
01:02:19.562 --> 01:02:21.771
In a few minutes, to have
a meeting with steering,


1107
01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:23.061
and I don't know why.

1108
01:02:23.145 --> 01:02:25.228
I do not know which branch,

1109
01:02:25.311 --> 01:02:28.394
, but here the customer is
the king, and events ...


1110
01:02:28.477 --> 01:02:30.101
are client! Help me!

1111
01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:32.475
Take a chance. 
I can do nothing.

1112
01:02:32.558 --> 01:02:35.474
Call us and ask for the revision
of the vehicle, dl Cox.


1113
01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:38.765
- We see you. O to call
my lawyer, dickweed!!


1114
01:02:38.848 --> 01:02:40.865
Is not his fault. It no
longer produces the machine.


1115
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.429
Not! Of course it was my fault! Thank
You for your solidarity. Excellent!


1116
01:02:44.513 --> 01:02:46.679
Tom, what do we do?"

1117
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.763
Free.

1118
01:02:47.762 --> 01:02:50.594
We will not stop if we can
find a solution other.


1119
01:02:50.677 --> 01:02:53.426
And what are you doing?" There
are a blockage of traffic.


1120
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.301
Do not know! All it can happen.

1121
01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:58.509
Is It? regardless of what is happening?
s Juan will save us?


1122
01:02:58.592 --> 01:03:01.551
Or... Natasha
's regime

1123
01:03:03.673 --> 01:03:06.589
Well, brake.

1124
01:03:06.672 --> 01:03:08.672
Children, prepare.

1125
01:03:07.714 --> 01:03:10.421
Daddy, e my car. 
If I say brake, brake.

1126
01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:14.824
I stop, for it is your car, but I need to pee. 1136
coolant 01:03:12.708... > 01:03:14.541 i pee in this car?


1127
01:03:15.253 --> 01:03:17.419
-Julia glass, please... What?

1128
01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:21.519
There is no glass.
No 1139/98

1129
01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.375
Hold the wheel, please.

1130
01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.624
Okay, ready!

1131
01:03:37.996 --> 01:03:40.495
-is better? Yes, a little.

1132
01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:44.452
Enough.

1133
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.951
Well, I will come to a halt.

1134
01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:49.326
No, wait.

1135
01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.700
Let me to play it.

1136
01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:56.115
There you are again, motherfucker!

1137
01:04:01.946 --> 01:04:03.154
But pee!

1138
01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:05.112
Played pee on me!

1139
01:04:05.195 --> 01:04:07.112
I'll make you swallow poop!

1140
01:04:19.566 --> 01:04:20.608
Journal Besauce?

1141
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.940
Yes, captain?

1142
01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:24.731
There is a group of crisis there. Where?

1143
01:04:24.814 --> 01:04:26.606
In Like Beauvau, load!

1144
01:04:26.689 --> 01:04:28.938
We got idiots in the group
to the members of the elite.


1145
01:04:28.939 --> 01:04:30.939
But how?

1146
01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.437
They bazooka. will dispose of
them, there is no other way.


1147
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.019
In any case, captain.

1148
01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.603
Have a great sense of humor.

1149
01:04:35.686 --> 01:04:37.810
Evacuating the helicopter on the roof.

1150
01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:41.476
Is a car with the sunroof, do you?
This is of no importance!


1151
01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:44.641
Just as it will take at this speed?
Minutes -Faltam to impact.


1152
01:04:44.725 --> 01:04:47.474
No other solution, official Besauce?

1153
01:04:48.265 --> 01:04:49.389
Dickweed!!

1154
01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:56.262
We had to stop. my father you step
on the pedal with everything.


1155
01:04:56.346 --> 01:04:59.178
There should be no no trace.

1156
01:05:10.716 --> 01:05:12.382
Berths, policial!

1157
01:05:12.924 --> 01:05:14.173
What makes this guy?

1158
01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:16.131
Understand, Dad?

1159
01:05:16.215 --> 01:05:19.297
Freie Do not release the
pedal to stop the Medusa?


1160
01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.129
Wait a minute, children.

1161
01:05:25.045 --> 01:05:27.045
Free.

1162
01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:31.251
Free, Papai!

1163
01:05:31.085 --> 01:05:32.168

Tom, what have you done?

1165
01:05:46.955 --> 01:05:48.704
We cannot now stop.

1166
01:05:48.787 --> 01:05:52.619
Hell, is a new car! New! Damn!

1167
01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:55.660
Whoops!

1168
01:06:09.323 --> 01:06:10.488
Vignali?

1169
01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:13.171
But come, autumn.

1170
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.899
Besauce! Besauce, are you all right?

1171
01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:31.107
Yes. Come, let us go back there.

1172
01:06:31.856 --> 01:06:33.606
-hard frost. We need a machine.

1173
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.814
Do place!

1174
01:06:34.897 --> 01:06:37.896
What does this mean? do not
see that my wife is ill?


1175
01:06:37.979 --> 01:06:40.188
Sacha must go to hospital.

1176
01:06:42.437 --> 01:06:44.644
They arrived at the time.

1177
01:06:44.727 --> 01:06:47.726
My Sacha they need an
escort to the hospital.


1178
01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:48.976
Vehicle 
-Requisio. What?

1179
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.809
Out of the machine! 
What did he say?

1180
01:06:50.892 --> 01:06:52.892
Come on, come on!

1181
01:06:51.809 --> 01:06:55.308
Jean-Ma, saying something! For the
first time in his life, to react!


1182
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:58.182
But... You are useless.

1183
01:07:04.346 --> 01:07:05.638
Airboat

1184
01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.804
I halt to break the head!

1185
01:07:07.887 --> 01:07:10.178
And this crazy nor a door?
You will come to kill us.


1186
01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:12.343
Seems!

1187
01:07:12.427 --> 01:07:14.718
Pay my door steal!

1188
01:07:14.802 --> 01:07:16.802
A qu?

1189
01:07:15.842 --> 01:07:18.716
A to break his neck
and to your head down!

1190
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.008
Good morning, them.

1191
01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:21.340
Are a psychiatrist.

1192
01:07:21.424 --> 01:07:22.632
We can help you.

1193
01:07:22.715 --> 01:07:24.715
Way to boca!

1194
01:07:25.298 --> 01:07:28.088
- and where the police?
It does not seem happy.


1195
01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.504
Why attacking us?

1196
01:07:32.587 --> 01:07:35.295
You will see what I am going
to do with your children.


1197
01:07:39.335 --> 01:07:41.335
Whoops!

1198
01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:43.458
Hurts, damn!

1199
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.541
Get it!

1200
01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:52.123
For my mother, take it
or I will go mad!

1201
01:07:52.206 --> 01:07:54.414
Does not lend the spear me!

1202
01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:05.368
Don't move, you're dead!"
What is dirt that?


1203
01:08:05.451 --> 01:08:08.909
Away from there! -stupid!

1204
01:08:15.448 --> 01:08:16.907
Give me that.

1205
01:08:20.488 --> 01:08:22.488
Thanks.

1206
01:08:21.403 --> 01:08:26.070
Now, I shall take advantage of this
harpoon or we ended by wounds someone.


1207
01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:28.152
URGENT LIVE NEWS

1208
01:08:27.235 --> 01:08:31.359
In addition to the normal traffic

1209
01:08:31.443 --> 01:08:35.774
for the first weekend of the month
of July, there is a very unusual.


1210
01:08:35.858 --> 01:08:39.981
With BFMTV rooms helicopter in this moment:

1211
01:08:40.065 --> 01:08:43.146
we see a machine which
does not seem to stop ...


1212
01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:44.980
and which caused the damage,

1213
01:08:45.064 --> 01:08:47.520
in particular in the
infrastructure of motorways.


1214
01:08:47.604 --> 01:08:49.811
More information with the
freighter Karine Moulin,


1215
01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:52.061
our correspondent special to the site.

1216
01:08:52.143 --> 01:08:55.435
At the moment, the information on
which we have them is uncertain.


1217
01:08:55.517 --> 01:08:59.184
Is a terrorist, a lunatic who
made the hostage a family,


1218
01:08:59.266 --> 01:09:00.809
or a dealer.

1219
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:02.724
Machine is running at maximum speed

1220
01:09:02.808 --> 01:09:05.514
toward the traffic jam behind my back.

1221
01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.094
And now, what do we do, Dad?

1222
01:09:17.635 --> 01:09:19.178
I do not know.

1223
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:25.233
To escape. Because we are a family.

1224
01:09:25.258 --> 01:09:28.425
A wretched state of the family!

1225
01:09:28.507 --> 01:09:31.340
-a family be damned!
 a family be damned!

1226
01:09:31.441 --> 01:09:35.339
-a family be damned!
 a family be damned!

1227
01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:37.879
What happened?

1228
01:09:38.421 --> 01:09:42.462
He is also suspected. I still
say that the type is suspect.


1229
01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.785
A wretched state of the family!

1230
01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:47.251
A wretched state of the family!

1231
01:09:47.335 --> 01:09:49.917
Bottling of 25 km

1232
01:09:52.874 --> 01:09:54.916
Well, in a few minutes above.

1233
01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:57.081
Chance 
-Last to tell us all. 
-Tom ...

1234
01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:58.957
Dad, I speak to my wife.

1235
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.039
I must tell you one thing, a burden.

1236
01:10:01.123 --> 01:10:03.497
Are a burden. talk with Julia.

1237
01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.662
Water leaks in your house ...

1238
01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:09.026
I was a little bit responsible.

1239
01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:13.202
I had a problem with downloading
and it would not tell.


1240
01:10:13.285 --> 01:10:15.660
(E andando a 190km/h),

1241
01:10:15.743 --> 01:10:17.368
I was in your car.

1242
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.324
Has been the date
of birth of my friend,

1243
01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:22.324
has not yet been my former
and took the machine.


1244
01:10:22.407 --> 01:10:24.824
I wanted to take a
walk on a new shopping

1245
01:10:24.907 --> 01:10:27.531
to show that was the
family, do you know that?


1246
01:10:29.489 --> 01:10:30.989
Not.

1247
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:32.570
Well, anything else?

1248
01:10:35.528 --> 01:10:36.653
Julia ...

1249
01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:38.693
What is this?" What you like this guy?

1250
01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:40.694
In English, please.

1251
01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:41.901
What ...? hell!

1252
01:10:41.985 --> 01:10:44.525
What this painter has to offer?

1253
01:10:44.609 --> 01:10:48.065
Not that he is better, youre worse.

1254
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:51.565
There is a sentence. 
Not, it is the truth.

1255
01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.815
Look at this machine.

1256
01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:56.396
Years ago, we laughed machines
so today it no longer laughs.


1257
01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.186
- and with it to laughing at? -don't-l sun.
I speak of you.


1258
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:04.644
Tom we met in the college
was funny, costume ...


1259
01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:08.392
forgiveness.

1260
01:11:08.933 --> 01:11:10.476
Has been tender, unpredictable.

1261
01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:14.140
Do not know, passionate about everything:
for love, for medicine, for the world.


1262
01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:15.515
Are still in love.

1263
01:11:15.599 --> 01:11:18.348
Yes with the machine, card
and its purpose being.


1264
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.387
Tom ...

1265
01:11:21.472 --> 01:11:22.513
There is something.

1266
01:11:22.597 --> 01:11:23.638
More?

1267
01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:28.177
We will try to make a
"cinegnica" immobilization.


1268
01:11:28.261 --> 01:11:31.510
A qu?

1269
01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.467
Goes well... Is not far away.

1270
01:11:37.468 --> 01:11:39.468
Sim.

1271
01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:40.091
- Reduce speed slowly. well.

1272
01:11:41.466 --> 01:11:43.590
But what does it do?

1273
01:11:43.672 --> 01:11:45.590
But what is she doing?" 
-I don't know.

1274
01:11:47.089 --> 01:11:48.630
-is approached. 
Care. -there will.

1275
01:11:52.628 --> 01:11:54.212
-already reached. i stop.

1276
01:11:56.461 --> 01:11:58.211
Come, come ...

1277
01:12:01.335 --> 01:12:03.000
it operates works!

1278
01:12:05.124 --> 01:12:06.708
Very well, very well.

1279
01:12:11.872 --> 01:12:13.247
You, you, you...

1280
01:12:16.371 --> 01:12:17.870
malfunctioning brake

1281
01:12:17.954 --> 01:12:21.285
not, I will come to a halt. Brakes broken.
Voi accelerate.


1282
01:12:23.493 --> 01:12:25.160
No, no, no!

1283
01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.742
Go!

1284
01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:30.366
Well, I will take my children. This.

1285
01:12:36.114 --> 01:12:39.530
- What do we do? -open and
give me the children!


1286
01:12:39.613 --> 01:12:41.155
Indeed? Yes!

1287
01:12:43.612 --> 01:12:45.612
Are you sure?

1288
01:12:48.485 --> 01:12:50.402
Door is locked!

1289
01:12:50.485 --> 01:12:51.734
So the window!

1290
01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:53.193
Through the window, come on!

1291
01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:54.567
Is a madness! Come on!

1292
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:56.774
Children, come on! quickly! Move!

1293
01:12:56.858 --> 01:12:57.941
Come on!

1294
01:12:58.482 --> 01:13:00.524
Go, my dear. you go and be brave.

1295
01:13:00.607 --> 01:13:03.023
Secret is that her shoes has given ...

1296
01:13:03.106 --> 01:13:05.522
Yes? she gave Mrs Brebineau.

1297
01:13:05.605 --> 01:13:09.084
Who is she?

1298
01:13:09.729 --> 01:13:12.853
"love me! 
-Du, go!

1299
01:13:12.937 --> 01:13:14.686
Get it!

1300
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.722
Tower, Noah! loosen the belt! Quickly!

1301
01:13:29.597 --> 01:13:31.431
Well, miss?" Great. Come on!

01:13:31.513 --> 01:13:32.637
Continues!

1303
01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:35.200
Go, son.

1304
01:13:35.261 --> 01:13:36.719
My love!

1305
01:13:36.804 --> 01:13:38.428
You Can Go.

1306
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.760
Hold it.

1307
01:13:39.844 --> 01:13:41.094
Come on!

1308
01:13:51.215 --> 01:13:52.299
