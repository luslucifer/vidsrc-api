1
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:45.189
Sorry, Cassandra, I'm a bit out of breath.
I've just been doing me physical jerks.


2
00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:47.341
Oi, Gazza. Come here.

3
00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.272
Don't you tell her Rodney's still in bed
sleeping off another hangover, will ya?


4
00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:53.778
What d'you take me for?

5
00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:56.623
Give me five minutes,
and I'll write out a list!


6
00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:01.907
Alright, Cassandra.
I'll tell Rodney you called as soon as he gets up.


7
00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.694
- I don't believe you!
- I mean in! I mean in!


8
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.711
Tell Cassandra I'll phone her later.
I've gotta get this stuff in the freezer.


9
00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.744
Raquel says she'll call you later.
Oh yes, she’s alright.


10
00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:18.275
I mean, women like being
pregnant, don't they?


11
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.040
And how you feeling?
Good. Me? Oh I'm alright.


12
00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:27.043
I've just joined the over-sixties club
down on the estate.


13
00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:28.989
Given me a new
lease of life, it has.

14
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:33.005
Eh? Well, yes, there are women there,
but I'm not interested in all that.


15
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.510
No, like a squirrel
ain't interested in nuts!


16
00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:43.403
I used to be a bit of a Casanova in my younger days.
I could tell you a tale or two, Cassandra!


17
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.229
During the war... Eh?

18
00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:48.770
There's someone at your front door,
is there?


19
00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.330
Oh well… Bye for now, Cassandra.
Bye, love.


20
00:01:55.143 --> 00:02:00.310
Mrs Lane, or may I call you Dora?
May  I have the pleasure of this next dance?


21
00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:01.983
Thank you.

22
00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:10.906
Oh my God!

23
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.499
What time d'you call this, Rodney?

24
00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:15.208
I call it 11.30, Unc.
What time d'you call it?


25
00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:18.588
It's disgusting. A young man like you
getting up at 11.30 in the morning.


26
00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:21.968
Your brother was up and out of here
at 7 o’clock.


27
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:24.417
Then he came back
and took Raquel out shopping.


28
00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:29.594
Yes, that’s because Del has got
a job to go to and money-earning opportunities.


29
00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.812
And he's got a woman in his life!
What have I got, eh?


30
00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:36.823
I've got no job to go to
I’ve got no wife to say good morning to.


31
00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:41.565
You might be a bit more chirpy
if you didn’t wake up with such a hangover!


32
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.997
I have not got...

33
00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:48.476
I have not got a hangover!
I am fine! There's nothing wrong with me.


34
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.307
Cassandra phoned.
Just wanted to know how you were.


35
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.752
You didn't tell her, did you?

36
00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:57.586
No, I said you were alright.
She just wants your cheque towards the mortgage.


37
00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.611
Yeah, well, I'll sort that out.

38
00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:07.954
- Morning.
- Morning, Rodney.


39
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.653
That reminds me, sweetheart.
The video shop's got Nightmare On Elm Street in.


40
00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.820
Albert's just been talking to Cassandra.
She just wanted to know how I was.


41
00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:20.422
He didn't tell her, did he?

42
00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:23.384
No, he said I was all...
What d'you mean, he didn't tell her?


43
00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:25.356
What’s the matter?
You alright, sweetheart?


44
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:32.110
Yeah, I'm OK. A backache, that's all.
It happens every time we go out in your van.


45
00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:36.251
It's just not very comfortable,
specially in my condition. I'm alright now.


46
00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.454
No, no. Listen to me, sweetheart. I’ll te…

47
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.937
You leave the shopping.
I will continue with the shopping.


48
00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.694
You go and have a sit down.
Go on, that's an order!


49
00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:49.759
Aye, aye, sir.
Don't forget to deliver our birthday present.


50
00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:53.993
- Whose birthday is it?
- It’s Boycie's little kid. Anyway.


51
00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:58.027
You see, that three-wheeled van
wasn't designed for pregnant women with shopping.


52
00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:04.295
She's getting bigger by the day.
She's already been banned from the Body Shop.


53
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.665
If I could just get the engine to run
a bit smoother, I’m sure that would help.


54
00:04:08.857 --> 00:04:11.854
I've told you, they stopped
making spares for that van years ago.


55
00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.529
I've tried everywhere. Breakers' yards,
spares shops, archaeologists.


56
00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:19.444
Archaeologists?

57
00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:22.958
Listen to me, Rodney. 
Talking of archaeologists,

58
00:04:22.993 --> 00:04:25.709
you look as though you've just been
dug up from somewhere.


59
00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:28.126
Why don't you take a leaf out of
your uncle's book. Look at him.


60
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:33.752
He’s in there, he's joined the over-sixties club
and looks like a born-again teddy boy.


61
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.933
You're not suggesting
I join the over-sixties club?


62
00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.344
No, they wouldn’t have you.
You look too old.


63
00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:42.935
There's been another mugging
on the estate.


64
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.999
You don't want to believe all you read, Raquel.
A lot of that is exaggerated, you know.


65
00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:51.463
If I got my hands on them,
I'd string 'em up from the nearest lamppost.


66
00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:55.804
Listen to you. It's nearly the 21st  century
and he still wants to hang 'em up by their neck.


67
00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.752
Who said anything about hanging them up
by their neck?


68
00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:03.608
They better not try anything on me.
I used to box for the Nuggets.


69
00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.432
Will you sit down,
you soppy old sod?


70
00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:10.152
You’ll have my clap as you want it
on the floor in a minute.


71
00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:22.872
Thank you for calling Boyce Autos and Car Accessories.
How can I help you?


72
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:25.352
Oh it's you Marlene!

73
00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:30.576
Yes, I'm going out to get Tyler’s
birthday present in a minute!


74
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:36.401
Marlene, I'm trying to run a business here.
If you remember, I sell quality used cars!


75
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.276
D'you want me to take that
old banger down the scrap-yard?


76
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:42.579
- If they'll take it!
- I'll get me coat.


77
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:45.969
A baby grand?

78
00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:51.049
Well, of course I want him to be cultured,
but for God’s sake, Marlene, he's only two!


79
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.409
I don't give a toss what
Beethoven could do when he was three!


80
00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:57.621
Tyler should start off in a smaller way.

81
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.969
Alright Marlene. Leave it to me.
I'll surprise you.


82
00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:08.014
Where can I get a mouth organ from?

83
00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:14.127
Thank you for calling Boyce Autos
and Car Accessories. How can…


84
00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:16.043
Oh, it's you Del Boy!
How's your luck?


85
00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.649
Couldn’t be better Boycie.

86
00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:21.045
Business is so good
there aren't enough hours in the day.


87
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.960
I'm thinking of taking on extra staff.

88
00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:25.806
Yeah, 'taking on' being the operative phrase!

89
00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.943
Rodney, why don’t you do something useful,
like go back to bed, son!


90
00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:34.735
Hello, Boycie, listen, we've got
a birthday present for the ankle-biter.


91
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.088
Cheers, Del. We're gonna have a little celebration.
Just a few dear and close friends.


92
00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:44.459
I suppose you and your family could come
along as well if you like.


93
00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:46.797
Thank you, that’s very nice of you Boycie.

94
00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:51.910
Listen, d'you reckon you could get one of your
mechanics to have a look at my van?


95
00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.983
I know just the bloke.
He had a family bereavement recently.


96
00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.146
He could do with a good laugh.

97
00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:05.333
Sorry, Del. I just think it’s about time
you got yourself something more powerful.


98
00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.347
- Like what?
- I don't know. A food mixer?


99
00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:14.806
Very gunny Boycie, but that little van
does everything that I need it to, don’t worry.


100
00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:19.583
Keep the van for business.
I'm talking about a second car.


101
00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:23.929
I've been hearing about all this crime
that’s been occurring on your estate.


102
00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:28.489
Don’t you think it’s gonna be safer for your Raquel
to be driving rather than walking?


103
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.264
That’s a point Boycie,
I’d never thought of that.


104
00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:35.874
Yes. I mean, a man in your position…

105
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.213
I mean, you need something
that’s gonna reflect your image.


106
00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:43.468
I've got a lovely
Skoda out in the showroom.

107
00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:48.884
Two years old, 8,000 miles on the clock, genuine.
You can have it for two and a half grand.


108
00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:52.982
Two and a half grand is a little bit
out of my price range, Boycie.


109
00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:56.456
- What is your price range?
- 400 quid.


110
00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:00.398
400? You can't get
a walking frame for 400!

111
00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.808
Just a moment, Del.
Your luck could be in.


112
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.323
I got a cracking little sports coupe,
came in as a part chop on a Honda Prelude.


113
00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:12.446
Beautiful bodywork, sound engine,
really nice little runner.


114
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:17.486
It just need a bit of a clean-up,
that's all. I was looking for a grand.


115
00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:21.839
But, seeing as it's my son's birthday
and you're a mate, I'll let it go for 400.


116
00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:26.284
Cushty! I'll pop down and take the butcher's at it
later then, Boycie. Alright?


117
00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.368
- Alright. Cheers, Del.
- Bye.


118
00:08:28.754 --> 00:08:31.099
I'm off then to scrappy.
Are these the keys?


119
00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:34.995
There's been a change of plan!

120
00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:47.956
- What d'you think, Rodney?
- I don’t know!


121
00:08:48.172 --> 00:08:49.844
She'll be putty in my hands.

122
00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:55.784
Rodney, you’ll never guess what?
I've only bought a new car! Gordon Bennett!


123
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.430
Albert,  I thought it was Simon Le Bon!
What are dressed up like that for?


124
00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:07.506
I'm playing the over-sixties dominos final
down the Nag's Head, against old Knock Knock later.


125
00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:09.112
So you've got a new car?

126
00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:12.674
Yes, a cracker. Raquel's just driven it back.
It's a beauty, innit, sweetheart?


127
00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.558
- D'you want a cup of tea, love?
- Yeah, I need something, Albert!


128
00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:23.539
So you're a two-car family now, then!
Well, one car, one three-wheeled van.


129
00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:27.913
Which is one car and three-wheeled van
more than you've got! Or ever likely to have!


130
00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:31.816
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Derek.
Bound to be a job in here for me somewhere.


131
00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:34.691
You'll have to come up with a good excuse
before you get a job, son.


132
00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:38.761
I mean, how you gonna explain away them

133
00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:43.749
Albert's got a good point, Rodney. In all of those 10 years
you weren't registered for income tax,


134
00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.880
national insurance or anything!

135
00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:50.214
Your work record shows that you left school at 16
and promptly disappeared off the face of the earth.


136
00:09:50.443 --> 00:09:51.699
I've already thought of that.

137
00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:55.311
I'm gonna say I was working
for a foreign oil company in Saudi Arabia.


138
00:09:55.483 --> 00:09:57.067
What, straight from school?

139
00:09:57.435 --> 00:10:01.097
One minute you're a milk-monitor,
the next minute you’re a petrochemist?


140
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.946
No, sorry bruv, that won't wash.

141
00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:04.629
Couldn't you say you'd been on safari?

142
00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:08.724
- What, for a decade?
- You could say you got lost.


143
00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:15.079
A friend of mine went
out with a guy who'd spent

144
00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:16.967
That's stupid, Raquel!

145
00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.353
Well, it's better than
your paper-round-in-Arabia cobblers, innit?


146
00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:23.392
Have you ever thought
of joining the navy, Rodney?


147
00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:29.297
Well, funny enough, Unc, no!
How can I join the navy?


148
00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:34.566
Exactly. In the old days they used to take anyone.
I mean, let’s face it, they took you!


149
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.469
But nowadays you've gotta have qualifications.

150
00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:41.246
What chance has
Lawrence of Peckham got, eh?


151
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.125
I don't mean the Royal Navy.
I was talking about the merchant.


152
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:51.073
Just think of it, Rodney. Imagine.
Monday, you sail out of Southampton Water.


153
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:53.507
Tuesday, you're through to the Bay of Biscay.

154
00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:57.863
Wednesday, you've rounded Cape St Vincent.
Thursday, you dock in Algiers...


155
00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:00.653
Friday it's your turn in the barrel!

156
00:11:02.517 --> 00:11:05.643
There was nothing like that
on any of my vessels!

157
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:12.454
A few funny ones but nothing like that!
Well, what d'you reckon, Rodney?


158
00:11:12.489 --> 00:11:15.751
If it's all the same with you, Unc,
I think I'll take a raincheck on this one.


159
00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:17.164
You don't know what you're missing.

160
00:11:17.624 --> 00:11:19.015
That suits me!

161
00:11:19.807 --> 00:11:21.475
Del, I've been thinking.

162
00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:26.478
Trotters Independent Traders has been going through
a period of commercial augmentation.


163
00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:29.442
No, I've been doing alright, Rodney.

164
00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:33.797
I was thinking, things must be getting
pretty hectic for you on the old business front?


165
00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:38.005
Straight, Rodney.
It's one power breakfast after another, it is.


166
00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:42.809
Yeah. I suppose it ain't all champagne
and backgammon for you yuppies, is it, eh?


167
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.184
I heard you saying earlier that you were
thinking of taking on more staff.


168
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:52.677
So, seeing as I am temporarily between positions
and if the conditions are acceptable


169
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.154
I am willing to work for you.

170
00:11:55.495 --> 00:11:57.734
No way, Pedro!

171
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.281
Look, I've got all...
No way, Pedro?


172
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.060
I don't need you, Rodders.

173
00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:06.416
I could be very useful to
you during this period of growth!


174
00:12:06.451 --> 00:12:07.662
How?

175
00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:09.920
Well... I'm a good salesman.

176
00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:13.743
Leave it out, Rodney,
you couldn't sell a black cat to a witch.


177
00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:20.908
- Yeah, but now I've got managerial experience.
- No.


178
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:26.205
- I could computerise your entire business!
- No.


179
00:12:26.877 --> 00:12:31.828
- I have got executive qualifications.
- No.


180
00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:35.383
Can you lend us a fiver, then?

181
00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:38.273
A fiver? I didn't realise
things were that bad, Rodney.


182
00:12:38.308 --> 00:12:41.366
And you want to be
my financial advisor?


183
00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:44.441
I'll be anything!

184
00:12:46.483 --> 00:12:48.289
I'm desperate, ain't I?

185
00:12:48.813 --> 00:12:53.855
Alright Rodney, I’ll tell you what. I will give you a job
with Trotters Independent Traders PLC.


186
00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:59.141
Fine... And what wage structure
will I have?


187
00:12:59.176 --> 00:13:01.409
Wage structure? I don’t know.
The same as before.


188
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:05.592
Good! So, what was that, then?

189
00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.637
If I've got cash on
the hip I'll pay you.

190
00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:12.783
And what title will I have?

191
00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:15.834
Well, we'll call you Lord Rodney.

192
00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:24.617
I meant, company title! See, I was thinking you could call me
your director of commercial development.


193
00:13:24.652 --> 00:13:28.001
Yes, alright. That sounds very good to me.

194
00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:33.675
Alright then son. As it says in the Bible,
'Clothes maketh the man.'


195
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.543
-  So I want you to whip round your flat a bit lively.
- And pick up my best suit?


196
00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:39.901
No, pick up your car-cleaning gear.

197
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:44.116
What d'you reckon?

198
00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:53.966
- How much d'you reckon I paid Boycie for it?
- What, he charged you?


199
00:13:54.905 --> 00:13:58.538
I stole it off him, Rodders.

200
00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:03.063
It's a peach,
it handles like Maradona.


201
00:14:03.984 --> 00:14:07.841
Oh, Del. Look at the paintwork!
It's got no shine to it!


202
00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:10.492
By the time I've
finished it’ll look brand new.

203
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:23.089
Listen. I’ve been meaning to ask you something..
It's a little bit embarrassing.


204
00:14:23.918 --> 00:14:26.885
- I'm not cleaning it!
- You bloody well are!


205
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.130
Oh no! The days when I used to do
all your dirty work are long gone!


206
00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:35.461
I used to run my own computer section Del!
I was an executive!


207
00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:41.883
And now you're cleaning my Capri Ghia!
You seem to forget, Rodney, you are my employee!


208
00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:48.522
Since you left Cassandra and your job,
you’ve been eating and sleeping in my flat for nix!


209
00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:52.542
If you wanna hand in your resignation
that is alright by me.


210
00:14:52.577 --> 00:14:56.654
I'll help you find a little bedsit.
I'll even give you a little leaving present.


211
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:59.464
A paraffin heater and a mousetrap.

212
00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:03.878
- Alright, I'll clean it!
- Are you quite sure about that?


213
00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:08.845
- Yes.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.


214
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.831
I'm most grateful.

215
00:15:13.873 --> 00:15:18.392
Look at that lot, over there
It looks like the Tetley Tea folks' day out, dunnit?


216
00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:23.665
Albert's looking very smart.
He must be after one of the ladies.


217
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.792
I wonder if it's old Lil with the hairy wart?
Or is it the Widow Manky with the disposable teeth?


218
00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:33.482
You should have more respect, Mike.
Those women went through a war for us.


219
00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:36.454
Yeah, you can still see the
bomb damage on some of 'em.


220
00:15:38.483 --> 00:15:45.345
It’d be lovely if Albert could meet some nice old lady
to keep him company. D'you know who he's after?


221
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.145
- Yeah. Your mum.
- My mum!


222
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.529
Yeah, that’s right. Him and his mate
are after sorting her out.


223
00:15:52.564 --> 00:15:57.191
- I'm not having this!
- No, but if your mum plays her cards right!


224
00:15:57.599 --> 00:15:59.823
Mum! I want a word with you!

225
00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:02.505
Yeah, alright, Marlene,
talk to you in a minute.


226
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.643
Can I get you a drink, Dora?
You don't mind me calling you Dora, do you, Dora?


227
00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:11.689
- Of course I don't mind, Albert.
- I just got Dora a drink.


228
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:15.039
Why'd you let Knock-Knock
get you a drink? It was my turn.


229
00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:18.862
- You can buy me a drink in a minute.
- Yeah, alright.


230
00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:23.096
- How'd the kid's birthday party go?
- It was very successful, thank you Trigger.


231
00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:27.066
All the right people were there,
and Del and Albert turned up.


232
00:16:28.092 --> 00:16:32.762
Thank you very much, Boycie. Thank you.
Now that he’s gone, who’s for another one, then?


233
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:42.166
Them over by the juke box.
The morons from outer space. Who are they?


234
00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.695
I don’t know, Del. They've been using the pub
for about two weeks now.


235
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.454
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they were regulars.


236
00:16:47.489 --> 00:16:53.025
But, like I say, I don't know nothing about them.
I think they’re friends of the old mongrels down there.


237
00:16:53.558 --> 00:16:56.125
Ollie! Just a minute,
come here son, will you?


238
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.733
What you want, Del?

239
00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:00.952
You see that gang over there by the jukebox?
D’you know anything about 'em?


240
00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:03.350
They started coming in
here about a fortnight ago.

241
00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:06.842
Have they been hanging
round the estate at night?


242
00:17:06.877 --> 00:17:09.542
Yeah, couple of times.
D'you want me and the boys to beat 'em up?


243
00:17:09.577 --> 00:17:13.717
- No, no!
- Oi, I don't want no trouble in this pub!


244
00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:18.957
- What you drinking, Albert?
- I'll have a large navy rum, dear.


245
00:17:18.992 --> 00:17:21.706
Puts lead in your pencil!

246
00:17:24.446 --> 00:17:27.249
- Well, there's a thing.
- Get old Knock-Knock a drink, will you?


247
00:17:27.284 --> 00:17:29.367
I'll have a pint of ordinary. dear.

248
00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.147
Why'd they call him Knock
-Knock?

249
00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:37.680
- Because he's a very bad dominoes player!
- I'm a better player than you, Trotter!


250
00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:41.710
- You've never beaten me at dominoes in all your life.
- I can beat you at anything.


251
00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:44.243
Even when we was at school
I could beat you at anything!


252
00:17:44.278 --> 00:17:49.010
Now, come on boys, calm down.
Start acting like grown-ups!


253
00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:52.087
- I had to laugh to myself tonight, Del.
- Did you, Trig?


254
00:17:53.631 --> 00:17:55.215
Why, something happened?

255
00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:58.869
I was walking across the estate
past the garage block.


256
00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:04.882
It was 7:30 at night, pitch-black,
and there's Dave polishing an old banger!


257
00:18:06.327 --> 00:18:07.719
It takes...

258
00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:12.435
Oh my God! I forgot all about my director
of commercial management!


259
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.369
You left him cleaning your car at night?

260
00:18:15.337 --> 00:18:17.221
I’d forgotten he worked for me!

261
00:18:18.079 --> 00:18:22.622
- What's Albert and Knock-Knock playing at?
- Dunno, looks like Ninja dominoes.


262
00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:26.898
- What you drinking, Boyce?
- Give him a large navy rum.


263
00:18:30.094 --> 00:18:32.007
Look at my clothes!

264
00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:35.231
I told you to wear your
car-cleaning gear, didn’t I?


265
00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:39.963
A director of commercial development does not wear
stonewashed Wranglers and Doc Martens!


266
00:18:39.998 --> 00:18:42.919
He does when he's cleaning
the guv'nor's Capri Ghia!


267
00:18:42.954 --> 00:18:46.901
- And I got Swarfega in me eye!
- Your finger's bleeding, Rodney.


268
00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:50.705
Yes, that’s when my hand
went straight through the bodywork!


269
00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:54.280
I'm bleeding, see! That’s blood!
You got any plasters, Mike?


270
00:18:54.315 --> 00:18:57.312
What d'you mean,
your hand went straight through the bodywork?


271
00:18:57.347 --> 00:18:59.140
There's a big rust hole in the wing.

272
00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:03.718
Boycie's blokes had filled it full with newspaper
and filler and then sprayed over it.


273
00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:07.836
That is slanderous, Rodney. That must have happened
before I took possession of the vehicle!


274
00:19:07.871 --> 00:19:14.021
- They were yesterday's newspapers!
- Were they really?


275
00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:18.495
Look, you took the car as seen, Del!
I don't owe you no favours.


276
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.063
That's a bit unfair, Boycie?

277
00:19:20.098 --> 00:19:23.385
What about that 36-piece tea service
he sold Marlene last month?


278
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.483
Yeah, that came in very handy. I gave it
to the Boy Scouts' fete for their rifle range.


279
00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:30.991
- That was genuine Dresden!
- Yeah, genuine antique Dresden!


280
00:19:31.026 --> 00:19:34.467
And it was guaranteed
dishwasher-proof!


281
00:19:34.802 --> 00:19:36.355
I'll do it, Rodney.

282
00:19:37.952 --> 00:19:39.853
I don't believe him sometimes!

283
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.426
I don't know how he can ask me,
with my executive qualifications


284
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:46.571
to go round to the garage block
and clean the Pratmobile!


285
00:19:47.094 --> 00:19:49.216
Don't you let Del
hear you call it that!

286
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.986
What about that very important client
I had come over from Belgium?


287
00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:55.815
I wanted two tickets to Wimbledon
so I could impress him.


288
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.195
You said, "Leave it to me Boycie,
I gotta contact to Wimbledon".


289
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.909
I got you two tickets, didn’t I?

290
00:20:00.944 --> 00:20:05.078
That's right! They drew 0-0 with Ipswich!
That makes us even!


291
00:20:05.113 --> 00:20:07.159
No way, Pedro!

292
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.703
I'll see you later, Del.
I'm going round Jevon's.


293
00:20:11.582 --> 00:20:14.852
What would you like, Dora?
How about a large snowball?


294
00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:20.002
- Oh, lovely!
- Mike, large snowball for Dora.


295
00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:30.006
- That's better. Alright, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine now.


296
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:34.116
Cushty. I'll pick up my Capri Ghia
in the morning.


297
00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:38.475
I’ll get my director of commercial
development to drive the van back.


298
00:20:39.422 --> 00:20:42.593
- Del, I don't wanna nag.
- Good. I’ll put a record on.


299
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:49.042
Can we afford to splash out 400 pounds on another car?
I mean, do we really need another car?


300
00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:52.285
Yes, we do! You see
the reason why I thought...

301
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.262
Look, just because the van gives me backache
was no reason for you to buy another car!


302
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.593
No, I know, but listen you’ll see. 
There is a very...

303
00:20:58.628 --> 00:21:01.282
It's a waste of money. You do realise
we've got a baby on the way, don't you?


304
00:21:01.317 --> 00:21:06.554
Yes, I do, little things do remind me.
You just shut up and listen for a minute, I’ll explain.


305
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.596
It's a very dangerous world out there, Raquel.

306
00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:12.781
And I don’t want you walking
down to the shops or the launderette.


307
00:21:12.816 --> 00:21:17.120
I want you to drive. That way you'll be safe and sound.
D'you understand what I’m saying?


308
00:21:17.674 --> 00:21:19.928
- Is that why you bought it?
- Yes.


309
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.434
- Aren’t you lovely?
- Yes!


310
00:21:23.802 --> 00:21:26.792
- I love you, Trotter.
- Do you?


311
00:21:28.228 --> 00:21:30.418
Well, you're only human, aren’t you?

312
00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.129
Fancy a cup of tea?

313
00:21:43.712 --> 00:21:45.564
Del! It's Albert!

314
00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:47.904
- What about Albert?
- There's no need to panic, alright?


315
00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:50.025
- What's happened to Albert?
- He's been mugged!


316
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.824
- He's been what?
- Is he hurt?


317
00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:54.033
I don’t know. 
But he has got double vision.

318
00:21:54.068 --> 00:21:57.660
- Where's this happened, Rodney?
- In his eyes.


319
00:21:58.423 --> 00:21:59.876
I don’t mean...

320
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:02.681
Oh sorry, yeah! As he was walking
home from the pub.


321
00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:06.398
I was just coming back from Jevon's and I saw this
ambulance, a crowd of people around him.


322
00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:09.320
- Did he recognize anyone?
- No. All he knows is there was four of them.


323
00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:11.779
Look, they’ve got him down the hospital.
Come on, let’s go.


324
00:22:11.814 --> 00:22:15.792
Alright sweetheart, you don’t worry.
We’ll sort it out, alright?


325
00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:21.548
Dipstick. Rodney!

326
00:22:22.084 --> 00:22:25.182
He's just gonna put some clothes on,
and then we’ll go.


327
00:22:31.098 --> 00:22:33.953
They said he might be
suffering from shock for a few days.


328
00:22:34.356 --> 00:22:37.064
You just wait 'til I get my
hands on the bastards what did it.


329
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:39.171
Then you'll see what a state of shock
really looks like!


330
00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:41.879
Now, you stay out of it! The police
can handle this perfectly well on their own!


331
00:22:42.464 --> 00:22:44.134
I don't need the Old Bill!

332
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:48.412
People in this area are used
to sorting their own problems out.


333
00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:53.568
It's traditional. I remember once
when I was about 10 years old,


334
00:22:53.785 --> 00:22:56.978
mum had some of her jewellery nicked by this
good-looking Italian bloke.


335
00:22:57.013 --> 00:23:00.576
He wasn’t good looking after
my Dad had finished with him!


336
00:23:00.977 --> 00:23:02.889
But how could you be
certain he was guilty?


337
00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:05.240
Because of the evidence, Rodney.

338
00:23:05.435 --> 00:23:09.734
Dad found one of Mum's earrings
on the back seat of this bloke's car!


339
00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:17.788
- It's alright, Unc. Just the door.
- Stay there. Calm down.


340
00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:31.792
- I just came round to see how Albert was.
- He's not too good at the moment.


341
00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:34.249
Come in.

342
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:41.031
I heard what happened to Albert.
How is he?


343
00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:44.836
He looks bloody horrible, don’t he?
They stole his watch, his wallet, everything.


344
00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:47.299
I know. How you feeling, Albert?

345
00:23:47.334 --> 00:23:50.932
I’m a bit bruised, dear.
I was jumped on by five of 'em.


346
00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:55.215
You just keep…
Five of them? I thought it was…


347
00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:02.291
Rodney, why don’t you make Cassandra
a nice cup of coffee?


348
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.097
In the kitchen…

349
00:24:08.522 --> 00:24:10.225
In the kitchen!

350
00:24:12.464 --> 00:24:14.207
Shall we go and
make a cup of coffee?

351
00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:24.157
Apres moi la deluxe,
as they say in that Latin quota.


352
00:24:29.341 --> 00:24:31.734
So you're working for Del again?

353
00:24:31.769 --> 00:24:34.973
Yes. That wasn't an easy decision.

354
00:24:35.008 --> 00:24:39.889
I had lots of offers from local companies,
you know what these headhunters are like.


355
00:24:39.924 --> 00:24:41.552
Well, no, not really.

356
00:24:41.587 --> 00:24:44.662
Del  asked me to be his director
of commercial development.


357
00:24:44.697 --> 00:24:48.065
Seek out new openings,
find gaps in the market.


358
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.018
And if the gap doesn't exist,
create one?


359
00:24:50.053 --> 00:24:55.488
Yeah, that sort of thing.
So I thought, that'll do me, lovely jubbly!


360
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.394
I tell you, it is pressure all the way.
I'm never off that phone.


361
00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:01.819
You've cut your finger!

362
00:25:01.854 --> 00:25:04.808
Yeah, Del got me to clean
his car yesterday and...


363
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:13.454
I just did it as a favour. I don't know if you’ve noticed
his new car parked downstairs. The green Pratmobile.


364
00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:18.485
- Does he know you call it that?
- No. I don't think he'd be too pleased.


365
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:23.215
So things are going well?

366
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.787
Yeah. We're into property development,
theatre...


367
00:25:27.822 --> 00:25:29.768
Toilet rolls.

368
00:25:29.803 --> 00:25:35.140
That's just the direct retail sales branch of the company.
We've got contacts in the City!


369
00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:37.833
What, the White City?

370
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:40.670
There's no need to laugh at us, Cass!

371
00:25:41.032 --> 00:25:44.820
I'm not laughing at you, Rodney!
I'm just trying to break the ice!


372
00:25:45.943 --> 00:25:48.803
So, how's our flat?

373
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:53.050
Much the same as when you left it.
I wish I could say the same about you!


374
00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:54.856
What's that mean?

375
00:25:55.144 --> 00:25:58.446
You've changed!
You're getting more like Del.


376
00:25:58.481 --> 00:26:03.780
You're full of front and bullshit, Roddy!
You're even wearing the same clothes as Del.


377
00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:10.053
These suits happen to be a new line
we're selling, that’s all. These are Romanian.


378
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.562
We just wear them to let the punter know
what they look like.


379
00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:15.627
D'you think that's wise?

380
00:26:15.937 --> 00:26:19.925
We do know our market, Cassandra!
And I am not getting like Del!


381
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.639
You are, Rodney.

382
00:26:21.674 --> 00:26:25.104
Look, you're even wearing
a Del Boy starter kit!


383
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.792
Del told me to wear this because...

384
00:26:28.561 --> 00:26:30.400
Understand one thing, Cass!

385
00:26:30.435 --> 00:26:36.239
- I am not getting like Del! No way, Pedro!
- No way, Pedro?


386
00:26:37.678 --> 00:26:42.969
- Look, I'm very busy, Cassandra.
- Yeah, well… I’ll see you, Rodney.


387
00:26:43.004 --> 00:26:45.318
- No, I didn't men it like that.
- Goodbye!


388
00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:47.835
I'll give you a bell during the...

389
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.871
Alright, it's only me!
I was just putting the security chain on.


390
00:26:57.906 --> 00:27:00.619
No one can get in. You’re safe now.
You alright?


391
00:27:00.943 --> 00:27:03.294
- Yeah, I'm alright, son.
- What are you doing then, Unc?


392
00:27:03.596 --> 00:27:05.592
I’m just looking through in me old box.

393
00:27:06.219 --> 00:27:12.914
See that? That's where I was born.
Tobacco Road, down by the docks.


394
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:21.387
That's the front of Tobacco Road.
There's your nan - there's your granddad.


395
00:27:21.422 --> 00:27:24.896
He'd just joined the army,
doing his bit for king and country.


396
00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:30.702
- Why’s he got a vest and plimsolls on?
- Well, he'd just deserted.


397
00:27:31.774 --> 00:27:35.431
Albert, tomorrow, would you like us
to take you back to where you were born?


398
00:27:36.145 --> 00:27:40.039
Ain’t there any more, dear.
They knocked it down.


399
00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:44.449
- That film you wanted to see is coming on in a minute.
- Oh thanks.


400
00:27:44.484 --> 00:27:46.688
- What film's that, then?
- ‘Out Of Africa’.


401
00:27:46.723 --> 00:27:49.772
Not another documentary about AIDS, is it?

402
00:27:49.942 --> 00:27:52.200
No, it's a film with Robert Redford.

403
00:27:52.572 --> 00:27:55.175
Did I ever tell you about
the time I was in Africa?


404
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:59.589
- Yeah, thousands of times!
- No. Why, what happened Albert?


405
00:27:59.624 --> 00:28:01.891
‘Well, during the war’…

406
00:28:01.926 --> 00:28:05.073
During the war
I was on this hospital ship.


407
00:28:05.108 --> 00:28:09.130
We'd just picked up some of the
wounded from Monty's North Africa campaign.


408
00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:14.154
We dropped 'em off in Durban.
I helped some of them lads off the ship.


409
00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:21.441
It was tragic to see some of them, bloody tragic.
I cried for 'em... Daft, eh?


410
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:27.122
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cried when me mum died.


411
00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:30.572
But you were only 16.
I was a full-grown man.


412
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.494
I shed a little tear or two, didn’t I,
when Rodney got married and left home.


413
00:28:35.943 --> 00:28:38.384
I cried even more when he come back!

414
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:42.834
The most frightening thing
in all my life happened while I was in Africa.


415
00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:48.101
We docked in Durban, and a couple of black blokes
came out and asked me and my mates


416
00:28:48.136 --> 00:28:51.498
if we wanted to go out and see the jungle.
We jumped at the chance.


417
00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:55.542
- You're like that when you're young, ain't you?
- Oh yeah, we've all done it, haven’t we?


418
00:28:55.577 --> 00:28:59.246
So we got up in this open lorry
and went off.


419
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:02.826
And after about two hours the undergrowth
got thicker and thicker.


420
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.834
Deep in the heart of the jungle. Anyway.

421
00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:09.462
Somehow or another I got cut off
from the rest of the party


422
00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:14.738
and found meself in this clearing.
I just started to retrace my steps


423
00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:16.695
when I heard a noise.

424
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.164
I looked around and standing there
was the biggest lion I've ever seen.


425
00:29:23.445 --> 00:29:26.224
You need all that, don’t you?

426
00:29:26.651 --> 00:29:33.536
I looked at him, he looked at me.
We just stood there looking at each other.


427
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.018
Then suddenly he went ‘aaaargh!’

428
00:29:38.524 --> 00:29:40.736
- Cor blimey, Albert!
- What’s happening?


429
00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:43.188
- Are you alright?
- Oh, yeah!


430
00:29:48.202 --> 00:29:50.489
I did a very childish thing.

431
00:29:51.471 --> 00:29:53.608
I wet meself!

432
00:29:54.797 --> 00:29:57.198
A full-grown man and I wet meself.

433
00:29:58.325 --> 00:30:02.334
Alright, alright Unc!
Nothing to be ashamed of!


434
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:08.359
Any bloke would have done the same thing
coming face to face with a man-eating lion!


435
00:30:08.871 --> 00:30:14.056
I don't mean when I was in the jungle.
I mean now, when I went ‘aaargh!’.


436
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.290
I don't believe it!

437
00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:35.920
We’ve got a change of clothes
in the airing cupboard.


438
00:30:36.112 --> 00:30:41.324
- Alright? How's Albert?
- He's not his old self.


439
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.249
- Oh good!
- What do you mean, ‘good’?


440
00:30:44.284 --> 00:30:46.949
- It was just a joke.
- I bloody well hope it was, and all!


441
00:30:46.984 --> 00:30:49.452
Alright, keep your hair on.

442
00:30:50.242 --> 00:30:54.082
- No, no, no!
- What?


443
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:56.855
Nothing. Nothing, sorry. Nothing.

444
00:31:09.569 --> 00:31:11.131
So he's no better then?

445
00:31:11.822 --> 00:31:15.671
No, he hasn’t been out for ages.

446
00:31:15.863 --> 00:31:18.643
The doctor said he should try to get back
to normal life, you know.


447
00:31:18.678 --> 00:31:22.768
That's right. I was there.
You know, I reckon the...


448
00:31:24.872 --> 00:31:26.693
I reckon the problem is, right…

449
00:31:26.899 --> 00:31:31.901
You are being very kind and considerate.
You're being patient, understanding.


450
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:35.700
Well, that’s not normal, is it?

451
00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.535
What do you want,
a doughboy round the ear, Rodney?


452
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.828
Ah, now you see, that's normal!
D'you see what I'm getting at?


453
00:31:41.863 --> 00:31:46.344
Well, this flat is all hurly-burly,
people shouting and arguing at each other.


454
00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:49.144
We don’t mean any harm
it's just the way we are.


455
00:31:49.305 --> 00:31:52.121
But now we're treating Albert
with kid gloves.


456
00:31:52.305 --> 00:31:55.857
If it goes on much longer,
he'll start using that as the normal.


457
00:31:55.892 --> 00:31:59.818
Then when we go back to the real normality
he’ll go back into shock again.


458
00:32:00.323 --> 00:32:02.485
You reckon we ought
to toughen up on him?

459
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.114
The gently, gently approach don't work.

460
00:32:05.293 --> 00:32:09.179
- I can't be hard on him, Rodney.
- Nor can I! But...


461
00:32:11.925 --> 00:32:14.576
We’d be doing it for him, wouldn’t we?

462
00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:18.331
Otherwise Del, believe me,
he’s gonna take root in this flat.


463
00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:21.261
Yeah... maybe.

464
00:32:22.135 --> 00:32:23.493
Here you are, Unc.

465
00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:26.691
No, no son. I'll sit over here.

466
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.146
Alright if I have a brandy, Del?

467
00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:35.104
Yeah, that’s alright. I’ll get it….
No, no, you know where it is, go on! Help yourself!


468
00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:42.374
We've got a very very busy day
ahead of us tomorrow, Del.


469
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:44.833
Yes, yes, we have, haven’t we Rodney?

470
00:32:44.868 --> 00:32:47.598
So we won't have any time to go down the Pakis
to get any shopping, will we?


471
00:32:48.122 --> 00:32:51.320
We can't expect Raquel to do it, can we?
Not in her condition.


472
00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:54.392
- We certainly can’t.
- So it must...


473
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.452
So, what are we going to do then?

474
00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:03.524
Well, we’ll have to send Albert down the shops.
Albert, you'll have to go down to the shops!


475
00:33:03.699 --> 00:33:06.092
- Me? I can't go out there, Del.
- Yes, you can!


476
00:33:06.127 --> 00:33:08.706
I don't feel really
up to it yet, Del.

477
00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:12.601
You go down there
and get them fish fingers.


478
00:33:13.798 --> 00:33:17.213
You listen to me. Rodney and I
are very busy at the moment,


479
00:33:17.248 --> 00:33:22.994
‘cause Trotters Independent Traders
are going to a phase of commercial augmentation.


480
00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:26.462
And with Raquel dropping her chavvy.

481
00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:31.069
I mean, we don’t want any lame ducks.

482
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:34.617
‘Cause you’re getting under our feet.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?


483
00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:38.568
So you better get up and get out,
‘cause you're no good to us the way you are, alright?


484
00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:47.967
Yeah... I understand, Del.

485
00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:53.050
I understand.

486
00:33:54.144 --> 00:33:55.768
Goodnight, boys.

487
00:34:02.304 --> 00:34:09.306
- That was a bit hard, weren't it?
- A bit hard? You just told me to toughen up...


488
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:13.324
I'm just saying
it was a bit tougher than I expected, that’s all.


489
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.907
Are you comfortable
in that chair, Rodney?


490
00:34:33.202 --> 00:34:36.407
I'll just take this into uncle Albert,
then I'll do your muesli.


491
00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:38.674
Lovely Jubbly.

492
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.584
All these other ones say the same thing.
'Albert Trotter lost at sea.'


493
00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:47.587
- He's gone!
- Gone? Where is he gone?


494
00:34:47.622 --> 00:34:49.647
He's not there! 
He left a note.

495
00:34:49.883 --> 00:34:53.799
'I won't get under your feet any longer.
Your loving Uncle, Albert.'


496
00:34:54.776 --> 00:34:56.110
Let me see that.

497
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.505
- That’s ‘cause what you said last night.
- ‘Cause of what I said?


498
00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.961
I didn't wanna say anything
until you told me to say something!


499
00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:07.038
Well, don't you blame me Derek. I was only trying
to get him out of this flat and back on his feet!


500
00:35:07.073 --> 00:35:08.247
I am not blaming anyone…

501
00:35:08.282 --> 00:35:10.351
Will you two stop arguing?
Go and find him!


502
00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:13.309
- Well, where's he gone?
- I don't know! Go 'n' look!


503
00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:17.497
She's right. Come on, let's go.
I'll take the van, you take the Pratmobile.


504
00:35:19.176 --> 00:35:20.493
What did he say?

505
00:35:30.727 --> 00:35:32.574
What do you mean, 'Pratmobile?'

506
00:36:50.657 --> 00:36:56.098
Hello! No, Rodney.
No luck at this end. How about you?


507
00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:25.584
You’re alright, Unc?

508
00:38:28.761 --> 00:38:30.414
What you two doing here?

509
00:38:31.669 --> 00:38:35.371
We were worried about you,
silly old git.


510
00:38:35.587 --> 00:38:37.934
We've been looking all over
London for you!


511
00:38:37.969 --> 00:38:41.479
- We found your note.
- How'd you know I'd be here?


512
00:38:41.892 --> 00:38:43.590
Just a guess, really.

513
00:38:45.604 --> 00:38:51.360
- You were born round here, weren’t you?
- Yeah. Tobacco Road. My house was...


514
00:38:52.607 --> 00:38:54.304
…somewhere round here.

515
00:38:56.946 --> 00:39:02.681
What's this all about then, eh?
Running away from home at your age!


516
00:39:02.716 --> 00:39:05.633
A lot of things been going
through my mind lately, Del.


517
00:39:06.148 --> 00:39:12.446
I didn't know if I was coming or going.
I feel I let the family down.


518
00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:15.272
I let you two down.

519
00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:22.417
- Don't be so bloody daft!
- You didn't let anybody down!


520
00:39:22.675 --> 00:39:25.033
I needed to be alone for a while.

521
00:39:25.256 --> 00:39:27.245
But where were you gonna go?

522
00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:34.668
I hadn't given it much thought, Rodney.
I didn't realise things had changed so much.


523
00:39:35.574 --> 00:39:42.555
When I first left home, I was about 15,
I just come down here and got a job on a trampsteamer.


524
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:45.057
Life seemed easier then.

525
00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:56.100
Things ain’t that much different now, Albert.
You can always come home, to your family.


526
00:39:57.097 --> 00:39:59.947
- Thanks, son.
- Come on then, let's go.


527
00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:06.330
You know, once upon a time ships from
all over the world used to sail in here.


528
00:40:06.911 --> 00:40:09.717
The water used to be covered
with a film of oil


529
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:16.654
and when the sun shone it sparkled
with all different colours.


530
00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:22.767
When I was a kid I used to
think rainbows lived in the water.


531
00:40:23.826 --> 00:40:27.028
So, you was a bit of a divvy
in them days and all, were you?


532
00:40:28.146 --> 00:40:31.847
- Oi!
- Alright. Sorry.


533
00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:36.292
There were tugs nudging
freighters into position.


534
00:40:36.961 --> 00:40:41.824
Cranes lifting out timber
from Canada, bananas from Jamaica.


535
00:40:42.893 --> 00:40:47.942
The pubs and the cafes, they were filled with
sailors from a hundred countries.


536
00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:54.058
By the time I was 7 I could swear
in ten different languages.


537
00:40:54.718 --> 00:41:00.214
There used to be streets all around here.
Loads of two up and two down houses.


538
00:41:00.397 --> 00:41:07.184
'Dockers' mansions' they called them.
Ragamuffins kicking footballs up against the wall.


539
00:41:07.219 --> 00:41:10.449
Women used to come out and chase us away
with their brooms...


540
00:41:14.545 --> 00:41:19.008
They were rough people,
but they was good people.


541
00:41:19.655 --> 00:41:24.795
During the Blitz some of the men
painted a sign on the roof of a warehouse


542
00:41:24.996 --> 00:41:27.932
so that the Luftwaffe pilots could see it.

543
00:41:28.226 --> 00:41:37.276
It said 'Dear Adolf, you can break our windows,
but not our hearts!'


544
00:41:42.095 --> 00:41:44.208
Look at what they've done to it now!

545
00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:51.332
- Yeah...It's terrific, innit?
- Terrific?


546
00:41:53.951 --> 00:41:57.188
Do you know how much some of these
drums are worth, Rodney?


547
00:41:57.223 --> 00:41:59.646
I’ll tell you how much they’re worth.
They’re worth an arm and a leg.


548
00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:04.631
Lord Linley's got one of these.
And Michael Caine.


549
00:42:07.094 --> 00:42:12.728
Makes you proud to be British, dunnit, eh?
I could do with a bit of this.


550
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:17.633
I can see myself with a nice little black Porsche
parked outside,


551
00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:20.748
with the old windsurfer
strapped to the roof rack.

552
00:42:21.905 --> 00:42:26.925
Then have a few friends down from the City
and we’d have a private party in a pub yonder.


553
00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:33.899
A few glasses of the old Moet, ‘cause I'm a champagne
and liver sausage sandwich man,


554
00:42:35.206 --> 00:42:40.767
and then we’d watch the old currant bun go down
behind the Docklands arena.


555
00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.528
Paradise.

556
00:42:45.352 --> 00:42:49.738
And after a few years
when the old property prices start to rocket,


557
00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:55.045
then knock it out to some rich Arab
for twice the purchase price.


558
00:42:56.766 --> 00:42:58.548
Lovely Jubbly!

559
00:43:01.086 --> 00:43:03.886
- You alright, Albert?
- Yeah, I'm alright, love.


560
00:43:04.222 --> 00:43:08.206
You didn't have to go running off like that,
Del didn't mean anything.


561
00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:13.038
I know, he's explained it to me.
It's just that I felt...


562
00:43:13.335 --> 00:43:19.982
I felt like a failure. I'm not a coward, Raquel.
There was nothing I could do, there was six of 'em!


563
00:43:20.933 --> 00:43:27.166
I know. Albert, nobody thinks you're...
Six of them?


564
00:43:29.513 --> 00:43:32.623
- Where's Rodney?
- He went out for a drink. Again!


565
00:43:32.948 --> 00:43:34.594
Well, that explains it.

566
00:43:34.777 --> 00:43:37.950
I met a couple of winos this afternoon
drunk as nudes they were…


567
00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:40.985
said they were celebrating St Rodney's Day.

568
00:43:42.482 --> 00:43:45.856
- I hope he hasn’t gone to the Nag's Head!
- Why, what's happening down there tonight?


569
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:48.582
Nothing! I just hope he hasn’t gone down
to Nag’s Head!


570
00:43:55.812 --> 00:44:02.110
- Is that the bell, Del?
- Yes. No, you’ll get it, will ya? I’m busy.


571
00:44:02.302 --> 00:44:06.762
- Raquel!
- No, Raquel can’t go. She’s busy and all. You answer it.


572
00:44:06.797 --> 00:44:09.204
- Me?
- You!


573
00:44:09.541 --> 00:44:12.259
Come on, there’s nothing to be afraid of, is there?
I’m here, ain’t I?


574
00:44:12.294 --> 00:44:15.721
You're gonna have to answer the door
sometime or another, it might as well be now.


575
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:20.030
Albert, answer the door!

576
00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:28.706
- Who's there?
- Knock-Knock.


577
00:44:33.444 --> 00:44:35.918
- It's Knock-Knock!
- Is it?


578
00:44:37.704 --> 00:44:39.453
I can't see him, Del!

579
00:44:39.488 --> 00:44:42.076
Of course you can't see him.
You haven’t opened the door yet!


580
00:44:42.296 --> 00:44:44.822
I don't wanna see him!
I can't face it, Del!


581
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.353
Alright, alright. Look, I’ll go, I’ll go…

582
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.388
You can talk to Knock-Knock Albert.
He's your friend.


583
00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:53.563
I don't wanna talk to him,
not at the moment.


584
00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:57.424
But he's most probably come to see how you are.
He might have brought you a bunch of grapes.


585
00:44:58.419 --> 00:45:02.750
I'm not feeling all that well.
I think I'll go to my room.


586
00:45:03.385 --> 00:45:07.126
Oi, you stay right where you are!

587
00:45:10.478 --> 00:45:12.284
Yes, that was Knock
-Knock.

588
00:45:12.732 --> 00:45:16.117
And look, he brought this back for you.
That was a bit of luck, weren't it?


589
00:45:16.312 --> 00:45:19.767
It's your pocket watch, Albert.
Where's he get it from?


590
00:45:19.802 --> 00:45:23.160
He found it under the bushes
on that patch of grass near the swings.


591
00:45:23.195 --> 00:45:24.915
What, where Albert was
mugged last week?


592
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:31.765
No! Where Albert and Knock-Knock,
whilst walking home from the pub last week, had a fight!


593
00:45:32.322 --> 00:45:36.256
- They had a fight?
- Yes, over Marlene's mum!


594
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:43.334
And Knock-Knock knocked him out!
You never were mugged, were you? You lying old git!


595
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:46.127
But what about his money
that went missing?


596
00:45:46.162 --> 00:45:50.255
Well, he lost it all, didn’t he?
At dominoes to Knock-Knock!


597
00:45:50.632 --> 00:45:54.694
- Oh Albert!
- I didn't know what to say!


598
00:45:54.729 --> 00:45:58.312
I felt silly, losing to a
man three years older than meself.


599
00:45:58.347 --> 00:46:04.693
He kept saying he was better than me at everything.
So I squared up to him and he hit me!


600
00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:07.483
Do you realize
the problems that you've put us to?


601
00:46:07.518 --> 00:46:11.984
The police have been out there making investigations.
I've been running round looking for five muggers.


602
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:13.940
- Six!
- Six?


603
00:46:13.975 --> 00:46:16.532
Oh it's six now, is it? 
Any more offers?

604
00:46:16.567 --> 00:46:20.485
I was embarrassed!
Once I'd said it I couldn't go back.


605
00:46:23.085 --> 00:46:27.720
You should have been down the Nag's Head.
There was the punch-up to end all punch-ups!


606
00:46:27.755 --> 00:46:28.913
What happened, then?

607
00:46:28.948 --> 00:46:32.074
That gang of skinheads was in there,
the ones that Del said had mugged Albert.


608
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:34.357
Anyway, you know oily Ollie, the greaser?

609
00:46:34.392 --> 00:46:37.488
His gang’s come in
they’ve only attacked the skinheads.


610
00:46:37.523 --> 00:46:43.123
There was blood up the wall, grease on the ceiling.
Ollie and his boys took a right hammering!


611
00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:47.134
It turns out them skinheads aren't skinheads at all.
They're coppers!


612
00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:50.309
- They're what?
- They’re undercover policemen.


613
00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:53.603
They was put on the estate a couple of weeks back
when the muggings started.


614
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.230
- Oh no! Oh my God!
- What's up, Del?


615
00:46:59.748 --> 00:47:02.965
Well, anyone would have done the same thing,
wouldn’t they, eh?


616
00:47:03.504 --> 00:47:06.779
You didn't have anything to do with this,
did you?


617
00:47:07.334 --> 00:47:10.300
Well... I wanted to get revenge
for that dozy old twonk!


618
00:47:10.844 --> 00:47:16.168
I sort of...
I gave Ollie 100 quid to sort it out.


619
00:47:16.203 --> 00:47:21.147
Oh for God's sake! This baby will be born
premature if I hang around you much longer!


620
00:47:21.182 --> 00:47:24.428
Be fair, sweetheart.
They looked like muggers, didn’t they?


621
00:47:24.738 --> 00:47:27.932
When Oliver and his
army get out of hospital…

622
00:47:27.967 --> 00:47:31.231
I've got a fair idea
where their first port of call is gonna be!


623
00:47:32.112 --> 00:47:33.632
Yeah, me too.

624
00:47:33.834 --> 00:47:38.660
Well, they better not try anything with me around!
I was Royal Navy boxing champion.


625
00:47:38.695 --> 00:47:41.826
I'm gonna kill him! I am!
I’m gonna kill him now!


626
00:47:46.671 --> 00:47:50.452
