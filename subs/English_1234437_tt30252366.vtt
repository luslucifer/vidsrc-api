1
00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:31.938
- Help!

2
00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.355
No...

3
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:48.897
No...

4
00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:04.271
So, he said that booking
out the entire event room


5
00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.104
was too much, but it is
the oldest social club


6
00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:08.812
in Chicago.

7
00:01:08.813 --> 00:01:10.397
Could be one of our
biggest clients.


8
00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:13.022
- That's great.

9
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:17.980
- Luce? Are you listening, Luce?

10
00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:19.938
Yeah.

11
00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:26.479
Hey, are you still
planning on meeting me


12
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.063
at the office tonight?

13
00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:30.646
- Uh, yeah, reservation's at 7,

14
00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:32.646
so I'll meet you
there around 6, 6:30?


15
00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:35.604
- Oh, reservation? What's
wrong with our usual place?


16
00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:37.437
- Well, I think getting
your first cover story


17
00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:39.062
deserves a little better
than loaded French fries


18
00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:40.604
at the All
-Nighter.

19
00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.271
And oh, you might wanna
take a change of clothes.


20
00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.604
- Really? Like, do I have to?

21
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.271
- Yeah, well, you said
you wanna be taken


22
00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:49.437
seriously as a journalist.

23
00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:51.562
Well, yeah I know
but...


24
00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:53.729
Yep, that's Odette

25
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.646
telling me how late I am. Okay.

26
00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:58.104
I will see you tonight, okay?

27
00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.855
- Okay, oh... See
you later, Luce!


28
00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:04.855
- I almost forgot.

29
00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.397
Okay.

30
00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:11.646
- Okay, go see Odette.
- All right.


31
00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:13.730
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay. Bye.


32
00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.146
Lucy, it's 7:00.
Get outta my bullpen.


33
00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:31.396
- Odette, I mean,
it's technically


34
00:02:31.397 --> 00:02:32.604
the publisher's bullpen.

35
00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:34.521
- Well, technically
I'm still your boss,


36
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:37.730
so I can say and do
whatever I want. Like this.


37
00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:41.730
- Uh, that's from this morning.

38
00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:48.854
- Oh. What are you still
doing here? Go home!


39
00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.897
- Roy is supposed to be
taking me out to dinner.


40
00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:55.104
- Ah.
- Uh, what ah?


41
00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:57.437
No, ah. It's a nice thing.

42
00:02:57.438 --> 00:03:00.355
- Yes, very nice.
Definitely nice.


43
00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:05.896
You try calling him?

44
00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:07.604
- Yeah, he probably uh,

45
00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:09.187
forgot to turn his phone
back on after the gym.


46
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.437
He does it all the time.

47
00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:13.312
- Look, if he
doesn't show in ten,


48
00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:15.854
why don't we go get a
slice of pizza? On me!


49
00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:19.229
- Luce? Oh, good,
you're still here.


50
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.437
Hey, I
thought you said...


51
00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:21.729
- I know, I'm sorry,

52
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.605
it's just, I got held
up getting these.


53
00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:27.437
- They're beautiful.
Raincheck on pizza?


54
00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.147
- Mm, mm-hmm.

55
00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:51.688
- I guess you were
right about dressing up.


56
00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:55.688
- Oh, hey, you look great.

57
00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:58.687
Um...
- So, how was...


58
00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:01.229
- I...
- Oh, sorry, go ahead.


59
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.312
- Oh, no, I was just gonna say,

60
00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:05.187
what are you thinking
about ordering?


61
00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:07.021
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:08.771
Uh, I don't know,

63
00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:11.063
I guess anything but
the deep dish, right?


64
00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:13.937
- Do they have pizza here?

65
00:04:13.938 --> 00:04:17.396
No, because of my article,

66
00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:18.771
the restaurant owners

67
00:04:18.772 --> 00:04:21.021
were smuggling the
cocaine in the...


68
00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:24.604
- Oh, the pizza crust, right.
Yeah, that was a crazy twist.


69
00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.605
Oh.

70
00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.063
So, did your mom
read the article?


71
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.896
- Uh, no, I...
- No.


72
00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:40.146
- I wouldn't expect her to...

73
00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.105
Oh, great, wine.
- Thank you.


74
00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:49.021
To the smartest woman I know.

75
00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.562
And my heart aches
to whoever thinks


76
00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:54.730
they can shake you off the
next story you sniff out.


77
00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:58.229
- Cheers to that.

78
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.688
- Cheers.

79
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.897
Hmm.

80
00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:09.521
- Thank you again.

81
00:05:09.522 --> 00:05:10.979
- Oh, thank you for coming.

82
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.687
That was very lovely.
- That was great. Hmm.


83
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.729
I was happy you did.

84
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.604
- Are you gonna come
back to my place?


85
00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:19.271
I gotta get back to work,

86
00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:21.312
so good night, you.

87
00:05:21.313 --> 00:05:23.647
- Um, listen, is
everything okay?


88
00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:27.646
- Uh, yeah, it's just
a lot of late nights


89
00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:29.772
with this new
account. That's it.


90
00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:33.522
- I meant, is
everything okay with us?


91
00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:37.188
- Of course! Yeah.
Everything's...


92
00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:42.312
- Roy...

93
00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:44.605
I can tell when you're lying.

94
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:46.938
Just tell me, what's up?

95
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.688
- It's not a big deal.

96
00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:54.396
It's just now that I've
been thinking about it,


97
00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:55.896
things have gotten
a little routine


98
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.813
and, and maybe we could do
something to spice it up.


99
00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:04.897
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I get that.

100
00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:10.812
Maybe, maybe I can finally come
on one of your camping trips.


101
00:06:10.813 --> 00:06:12.729
- Well, actually, I
was thinking something


102
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.563
a little spicier than camping.

103
00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:18.187
- Okay, what did
you have in mind?


104
00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:23.437
- You could be sitting at a bar
and then looking all gorgeous.


105
00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:25.562
I could come up to you and say,

106
00:06:25.563 --> 00:06:27.897
"Oh, hey, stranger,
what's your name?"


107
00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:32.812
- Okay, so like, role-playing.

108
00:06:32.813 --> 00:06:36.229
Yeah, yeah, that's...
that's definitely spicy.


109
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.312
- You think you can handle it?

110
00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:39.980
- Don't insult me.

111
00:06:48.272 --> 00:06:49.855
- I gotta get back to work.

112
00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:52.604
- Seriously?

113
00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:55.605
- 'K, I will make it
up to you. Promise.


114
00:06:56.438 --> 00:06:57.687
- 'K.
- Good night.


115
00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.230
- Good night.

116
00:07:12.772 --> 00:07:14.979
- What am I having to drink?

117
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.772
Well, I'll have whatever
you're having, stranger.


118
00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:23.354
I'll have vodka with...

119
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:24.562
just vodka.

120
00:07:25.647 --> 00:07:27.355
Oh, my God.

121
00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:51.812
Oh
yes, yes, I know,


122
00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:54.897
I'm late. Okay. Um...

123
00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:00.396
Yes, I'm sorry, 
I'm on my way.

124
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:03.897
I just had a little bit of
a late start this morning.


125
00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:08.063
Uh-huh.

126
00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:13.022
Yeah, I've got all that
stuff, I'm bringing it in.


127
00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:26.438
Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.980
Right, yeah, that sounds good.

129
00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:51.980
Uh, yeah, yeah. I-I will
um, I'll be there soon.


130
00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:58.062
By day, you're a
well-behaved socialite,


131
00:08:58.063 --> 00:09:02.772
but by night, you're
a very bad, bad girl.


132
00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:06.896
You show up at the Lakeview
Bar at 8 p.m. on Friday


133
00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:08.521
to drink alone.

134
00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:12.522
And the name you answer to
for this evening is Maggie.


135
00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:46.979
Oh!

136
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.562
- Heads up. Little birdy
told me the boss is gonna ask


137
00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:51.604
for your next story pitch at
the Monday review meeting,


138
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:54.437
so...
- Wait, aren't you the boss?


139
00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:57.313
- Exactly. You're welcome for
the inside scoop, by the way.


140
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.396
- Thanks.

141
00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:01.937
- You okay?
- Yeah.


142
00:10:01.938 --> 00:10:03.604
- You seem weird.

143
00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:05.313
- No, I'm just...

144
00:10:07.313 --> 00:10:08.897
I mean...

145
00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:12.021
Would it be a little
bit inappropriate


146
00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:15.437
if I asked you for some
um, personal advice?


147
00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:18.854
- Oh, my God! Yes.

148
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:21.480
It's getting so boring
in here. Follow me.


149
00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:30.230
So, what's the story?

150
00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:32.604
So, you know how Roy

151
00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:33.729
took me out to
dinner last night?


152
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.604
- Uh-huh. Yeah, of course.

153
00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:37.062
- Don't do that.

154
00:10:37.063 --> 00:10:38.479
- What?
- That thing you do


155
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.229
whenever I talk about Roy and
your answers get all like...


156
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.312
like, clipped.

157
00:10:43.313 --> 00:10:44.896
Yeah, uh-huh, sure.

158
00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:46.188
- Point taken.

159
00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.604
- Long story short,
Roy wants to role-play.


160
00:10:50.605 --> 00:10:53.146
And at first I thought he
meant like, a sexy librarian


161
00:10:53.147 --> 00:10:55.771
kinda thing. But
then, this morning,


162
00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:58.479
I get this package
with a note that says,


163
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.854
"Show up at this bar,

164
00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:03.522
wear this wig...

165
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.063
And call yourself Maggie."

166
00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:12.646
- Well, well, well.

167
00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:16.229
Looks like Mr. Ironed Shirts
isn't so tucked in after all.


168
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.937
Good for him.

169
00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.312
- So, I should
just do it, right?


170
00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.312
This isn't, this isn't weird?

171
00:11:23.313 --> 00:11:26.021
- Is his mom's name Maggie?
- No.


172
00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:28.271
- Sister?
- He doesn't have a sister.


173
00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:30.437
- Grandma?
- There are no family members,


174
00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:34.563
there's no exes, or
coworkers that I know of.


175
00:11:35.647 --> 00:11:38.022
I think it's a random name.

176
00:11:38.772 --> 00:11:41.771
- I say it's fine.
- Thank you.


177
00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:43.437
I guess I just
needed to hear that


178
00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:45.271
from someone who...

179
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:47.604
signs my paychecks, apparently.

180
00:11:49.313 --> 00:11:50.605
Okay.

181
00:12:06.772 --> 00:12:08.188
Hmm.

182
00:12:34.397 --> 00:12:35.522
I'm good to go.

183
00:12:55.022 --> 00:12:56.646
- Sorry to interrupt,

184
00:12:56.647 --> 00:12:59.021
I saw you from across the
bar and I thought to myself,


185
00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:01.563
this is a woman with taste.

186
00:13:02.105 --> 00:13:04.271
- So, you thought you'd throw
me into the back of your


187
00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:07.021
hot-rod convertible and we'd
speed off into the night?


188
00:13:07.022 --> 00:13:09.230
- Hmm, maybe after a drink.

189
00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:11.687
- I'm Maggie.

190
00:13:11.688 --> 00:13:13.230
- Call me Jimmy.

191
00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:19.396
- Uh, vodka.

192
00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:21.937
- Uh, the lady will
have an old-fashioned


193
00:13:21.938 --> 00:13:24.021
and I will have a dry martini,

194
00:13:24.022 --> 00:13:25.897
top shelf, with a twist, please.

195
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.522
- Do you always make a woman's
decisions for her, Jimmy?


196
00:13:30.772 --> 00:13:32.563
- Only when I know what's best.

197
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.563
Hmm.

198
00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:39.313
- You're staring at me.

199
00:13:40.938 --> 00:13:42.272
- I am.

200
00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:46.688
- Do I remind you of someone?

201
00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:52.812
- Uh, the... wipe
your mouth, Luce.


202
00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:55.647
- What?
- The lipstick, it's off.


203
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.730
It just isn't right, Luce.
- Oh.


204
00:14:07.772 --> 00:14:09.272
- Here.

205
00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:16.230
There, much better.

206
00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:27.937
How is it?

207
00:14:27.938 --> 00:14:29.605
- I've had better.

208
00:14:31.313 --> 00:14:33.146
- Well, I promise you, if
you give me another chance,


209
00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:35.230
it will be the best
you've ever had.


210
00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:39.772
- Okay.
- Good.


211
00:15:03.147 --> 00:15:04.855
- So, do I take the wig off?

212
00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.313
- No, leave it on.

213
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.562
- All right everyone,
weekly review meeting


214
00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:19.729
in the conference room in five.

215
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.355
Have your pitches ready.

216
00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:25.854
For those
of you just turning in,


217
00:15:25.855 --> 00:15:28.437
Magnolia was last seen
leaving a fundraising gala


218
00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:30.646
for the Lyric Opera
on Saturday night.


219
00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:34.187
Her mother, prominent political
campaign manager, Zelda Maines,


220
00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:35.896
reported her missing late Sunday

221
00:15:35.897 --> 00:15:38.938
and has not responded
to requests for comment.


222
00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:43.772
- Hey, does that woman
look familiar to you?


223
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.480
- Not really.

224
00:15:45.481 --> 00:15:46.729
Can you comment

225
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.354
on Magnolia Maines'
disappearance?


226
00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:50.937
- Look, Maggie's more
than just the daughter


227
00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:52.729
of my father's campaign manager.

228
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.271
She's a friend.
My sincerest hope


229
00:15:55.272 --> 00:15:58.438
is that she gets home
safe and sound. Thank you.


230
00:16:04.105 --> 00:16:05.688
- Ready to hit the
conference room?


231
00:16:06.438 --> 00:16:08.688
- Yeah, I'll-I'll
be there in a sec.


232
00:16:17.272 --> 00:16:19.479
- Oh hey, what's up? I
was just about to uh...


233
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.062
- Hey, uh, super quick,

234
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.937
have you ever heard of a
woman named Magnolia Maines?


235
00:16:23.938 --> 00:16:25.604
- Uh, no. Why?

236
00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:28.771
- Uh, it's nothing really,
it's just she's on the news,


237
00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:32.604
she's gone missing,
and she's got the hair


238
00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:35.730
and someone they just
interviewed called her Maggie.


239
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:41.271
- Okay, what exactly are
you asking me here, Luce?


240
00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:44.062
- Well, apparently she's
this big, fancy socialite,


241
00:16:44.063 --> 00:16:45.562
so I guess I thought,
I don't know,


242
00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:48.229
maybe you'd met her at
the firm or something?


243
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.771
- You're a crime reporter, hon.

244
00:16:49.772 --> 00:16:51.437
You're seeing
scandal everywhere,


245
00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:52.937
but everything is all right.

246
00:16:52.938 --> 00:16:55.437
There's lots of people in
this world named Maggie.


247
00:16:55.438 --> 00:16:57.687
- Uh, true, but I guess
I'm just wondering...


248
00:16:57.688 --> 00:16:59.271
- Uh, I'm just
getting another call,


249
00:16:59.272 --> 00:17:00.896
but I'll see you at your
place for dinner tonight,


250
00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:02.021
all right?

251
00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.397
- Yeah.
- Okay. 'K, love you, hon.


252
00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:08.605
- Great. Have it in by Friday.

253
00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:11.730
Lucy, you with us?

254
00:17:14.772 --> 00:17:17.271
- For my next story, I
would like to do a deep dive


255
00:17:17.272 --> 00:17:19.437
into the disappearance
of Magnolia Maines.


256
00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.312
- The socialite?

257
00:17:21.313 --> 00:17:24.230
The one who just went
missing last night?


258
00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:26.937
Is there really a story there?

259
00:17:26.938 --> 00:17:29.687
- Well, everyone loves a
pretty girl in distress story,


260
00:17:29.688 --> 00:17:31.604
and her mother hasn't
spoken with the press yet.


261
00:17:31.605 --> 00:17:33.437
I bet I could get
her on the record.


262
00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:36.021
- Look, no offense to this
young woman's loved ones,


263
00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:39.271
but why should the rest of
us care about this story?


264
00:17:39.272 --> 00:17:40.897
What's your angle, Lucy?

265
00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:45.479
- I will find it. I
know that it's in there.


266
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.229
- Okay, well, we're
gonna have to move on.


267
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.771
If I can't even tell
why you're interested...


268
00:17:48.772 --> 00:17:50.604
- Odette, when you broke the
city council scandal in '95,


269
00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:53.229
you dove in on a
hunch, didn't you?


270
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.062
You trusted your gut.

271
00:17:55.063 --> 00:17:58.313
That's what you've taught
all of us to do, isn't it?


272
00:17:59.605 --> 00:18:02.438
- I hate when you use my
own brilliance against me.


273
00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:04.604
Fine, run with it,

274
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.521
but I'll be keeping tabs.

275
00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:10.438
Okay, Ben, hit me.

276
00:18:13.188 --> 00:18:15.896
- About your story...
- Yes. Thank you so much


277
00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:18.562
for the green light. I'm gonna
go get started on it right now.


278
00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:21.521
- I noticed in the news someone
called the missing girl Maggie.


279
00:18:21.522 --> 00:18:23.855
- Uh yeah, short for Magnolia.

280
00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:26.187
- It's also the name Roy wanted.

281
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.104
- Oh yeah, right.

282
00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:29.771
I'm sure it's just
a coincidence.


283
00:18:29.772 --> 00:18:31.687
- So, it's not the reason
you're chasing this story then.


284
00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:34.812
Right? Because looking
for murder and mayhem


285
00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:38.730
in your relationships,
that's a slippery slope.


286
00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:41.480
- I'm just doing my job.

287
00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:53.687
- You better not be here to ask
me about one of the nasty cases


288
00:18:53.688 --> 00:18:55.854
'cause I am thoroughly
enjoying my lunch.


289
00:18:55.855 --> 00:18:59.104
- Magnolia Maines,
whatever you have.


290
00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.646
- The Maines case?
- Mm-hmm.


291
00:19:01.647 --> 00:19:04.021
- Will be closed by
the end of the week.


292
00:19:04.022 --> 00:19:05.812
- Is that on the record?

293
00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:08.230
- Well, that's
just common sense.


294
00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.854
When you've got a third
generation rich lady,


295
00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:13.562
history of depression, spends
most of her time partying.


296
00:19:13.563 --> 00:19:15.271
Big shot mom rings
the alarm bell


297
00:19:15.272 --> 00:19:17.271
and the department
comes running.


298
00:19:17.272 --> 00:19:19.312
If it were anyone else,

299
00:19:19.313 --> 00:19:20.896
we'd be telling them
to sit tight and wait


300
00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:23.187
for her to crawl back home
once her credit cards max out.


301
00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:24.938
- So, you don't
suspect foul play?


302
00:19:27.647 --> 00:19:30.646
- Well, crime scene techs are
processing the apartment now


303
00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:33.229
but I was in there this
morning, I gotta tell ya,


304
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.146
there's nothing in that place
that was screaming tragedy.


305
00:19:36.147 --> 00:19:37.521
At least not to me.

306
00:19:37.522 --> 00:19:39.187
- Okay, but have
you considered...


307
00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:41.312
- Lucy, Lucy,

308
00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.021
you really helped
out my youngest


309
00:19:43.022 --> 00:19:45.062
with that career day project.
I mean, now all she talks about


310
00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:47.479
is becoming some kind of
foreign correspondent.


311
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.729
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
- So, trust me,


312
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.521
I'm not shaking you off a story.

313
00:19:52.522 --> 00:19:56.063
I'm telling you there is
no story here. Got it?


314
00:19:58.105 --> 00:20:00.937
- Got it. Thank you, Detective.

315
00:20:00.938 --> 00:20:02.271
- Yeah, you bet.

316
00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:04.562
- 'Til next time.

317
00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:06.480
Enjoy that sandwich.

318
00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:10.854
- Hey, and you're not gonna
go trying to make it a story


319
00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:12.771
either, right?

320
00:20:12.772 --> 00:20:13.938
Lucy?

321
00:20:26.855 --> 00:20:28.563
- Hello?

322
00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:30.855
Roy?

323
00:20:42.313 --> 00:20:44.230
Whoever you are...

324
00:20:45.272 --> 00:20:46.272
just leave through the back door

325
00:20:46.273 --> 00:20:48.105
and I, I won't call 911.

326
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.437
- Whoa. Oh, baby,

327
00:20:52.438 --> 00:20:53.937
I'm sorry, I didn't
hear you come in.


328
00:20:53.938 --> 00:20:55.688
I'm listening to
my mindfulness app.


329
00:20:56.397 --> 00:21:00.187
- Oh, my God, you scared me. I
thought someone had broken in.


330
00:21:00.188 --> 00:21:03.437
- No, I just used the code on
the front door. Is that mace?


331
00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:05.271
- Yeah, I keep it
in all my purses.


332
00:21:05.272 --> 00:21:07.354
- Oh.
- What's for dinner?


333
00:21:07.355 --> 00:21:10.230
- I'm making salad and pasta.

334
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:16.854
Look
at the actor.


335
00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:21.604
Uh, Lucy, are even
watching? Did you see that?


336
00:21:21.605 --> 00:21:24.188
- Hmm? Yeah.
- Okay, what are you working on?


337
00:21:25.522 --> 00:21:29.437
- It's a news story. It's um...

338
00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:31.105
Magnolia Maines.

339
00:21:34.397 --> 00:21:35.771
No, no, no, I was watching it.

340
00:21:35.772 --> 00:21:38.771
- I told you, I have no
idea who Magnolia Maines is.


341
00:21:38.772 --> 00:21:40.729
- I know. It's not about that.

342
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.562
- Okay, then what's it about?

343
00:21:42.563 --> 00:21:45.272
- Well, there's
something else here.


344
00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.146
See, look at all
of these pictures.


345
00:21:48.147 --> 00:21:53.229
Magnolia is beautiful, and
fabulous, and sophisticated.


346
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.604
But she's never happy.
And now, look at this one,


347
00:21:56.605 --> 00:21:58.562
this is supposed to
be the happiest day


348
00:21:58.563 --> 00:21:59.854
in a parent's life,
and Magnolia's mom


349
00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:02.022
looks like she'd rather
be anywhere else.


350
00:22:02.605 --> 00:22:04.312
It's killing Magnolia.

351
00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:05.938
I can just see it on her face.

352
00:22:06.688 --> 00:22:08.897
- I'm not really
seeing it, Lucy.


353
00:22:11.272 --> 00:22:13.355
- Well, I see it.

354
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.313
Maybe they got in a fight,
or her mom cut her off.


355
00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:21.437
Oh...

356
00:22:21.438 --> 00:22:22.604
- What?

357
00:22:22.605 --> 00:22:24.604
- Does that look like
the library tower


358
00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:26.730
at Duran University to you?

359
00:22:27.772 --> 00:22:29.271
- It's hard to tell.

360
00:22:29.272 --> 00:22:31.604
- Well, you were just
there for your reunion.


361
00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:32.938
What do you think?

362
00:22:34.522 --> 00:22:36.896
- I guess so, yeah.

363
00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:40.729
- Graduation was 2010 so,

364
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.980
she would've been there
at the same time as you.


365
00:22:43.647 --> 00:22:45.812
- Yeah, but a lot of
people around here


366
00:22:45.813 --> 00:22:47.980
went to Duran
University in 2010.


367
00:22:52.772 --> 00:22:55.187
Okay, I'm gonna
get back to work.


368
00:22:55.188 --> 00:22:57.271
- What, you're going
back to the office?


369
00:22:57.272 --> 00:22:58.647
- Yep.

370
00:22:59.647 --> 00:23:01.729
Uh, the new clients?

371
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.271
Remember, I told
you. Gotta be there.


372
00:23:04.272 --> 00:23:06.355
- Yeah right, I remember.

373
00:23:15.397 --> 00:23:17.105
- Good night, Lucy.

374
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:19.647
- Good night.

375
00:24:23.272 --> 00:24:24.729
- Help me, Lucy!

376
00:25:47.647 --> 00:25:48.813
- It's me.

377
00:25:50.022 --> 00:25:54.312
Listen, I'm sorry things
got so weird last night.


378
00:25:54.313 --> 00:25:58.397
I think I'm overidentifying
with this Magnolia stuff.


379
00:25:58.897 --> 00:26:02.104
And uh, you're right, I
need to do a better job


380
00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:03.979
of separating my
work from my life,


381
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.104
so as soon as Odette
gets in this morning,


382
00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:08.605
I'm telling her I'm just
gonna drop the story.


383
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.271
So, what's up?

384
00:26:17.272 --> 00:26:20.146
- It's uh, about
the Magnolia story.


385
00:26:20.147 --> 00:26:22.521
- Oh, great call on that one.

386
00:26:22.522 --> 00:26:23.855
- Sorry?

387
00:26:24.397 --> 00:26:26.188
- You didn't hear about
the case development?


388
00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:28.687
- What happened?

389
00:26:28.688 --> 00:26:31.021
- Crime scene techs came back
with trace blood evidence


390
00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.604
and other signs of a struggle.

391
00:26:32.605 --> 00:26:34.604
Looks like they're
treating the investigation


392
00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:36.771
as a probable abduction now.

393
00:26:36.772 --> 00:26:38.312
- Oh, wow.

394
00:26:38.313 --> 00:26:41.437
- So, if you want to publish
your piece on the blog,


395
00:26:41.438 --> 00:26:44.355
you can probably break the
lede before the nightly news.


396
00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:47.604
- I should probably
check with my contacts


397
00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.771
at the local precinct first.

398
00:26:49.772 --> 00:26:52.062
- Oh, good call. We don't want
law enforcement blaming us


399
00:26:52.063 --> 00:26:54.146
for leaking anything privileged.

400
00:26:54.147 --> 00:26:56.104
If you didn't know about
the case development,


401
00:26:56.105 --> 00:26:57.897
what did you come
in here to tell me?


402
00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.897
- Just that the background
research is going really great.


403
00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:05.147
So, yeah.

404
00:27:08.563 --> 00:27:09.980
- Terrible liar.

405
00:27:19.897 --> 00:27:22.604
- Webb, Homicide.
- Detective, it's Lucy Carver.


406
00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:25.479
- Lucy, I was gonna call you.
- You're thinking abduction?


407
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.188
- That would be a best
case scenario, yeah.


408
00:27:29.563 --> 00:27:31.230
- So murder's on the table, too?

409
00:27:32.188 --> 00:27:33.979
- Look, I've already
said more than I should,


410
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.521
so you just sit tight
and I'll let you know


411
00:27:35.522 --> 00:27:37.647
the minute I have anything
I can share, okay?


412
00:27:38.438 --> 00:27:42.854
- Okay. Detective, what
are the odds that she's...


413
00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:44.479
you know, still alive?

414
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.688
- It's hard to say.

415
00:27:46.522 --> 00:27:48.437
The blood at the scene
wasn't a lethal amount,


416
00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:51.771
but there's no sign the
abductor took life-giving items.


417
00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:54.854
- Sorry, sorry,
life-giving items?


418
00:27:54.855 --> 00:27:56.604
- Yeah, sometimes
when an abductor


419
00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:58.271
plans to keep their vic
alive, they'll let them take


420
00:27:58.272 --> 00:28:00.146
certain items from the
scene, you know, medicine,


421
00:28:00.147 --> 00:28:02.937
wedding bands, but Magnolia
doesn't have anything like that,


422
00:28:02.938 --> 00:28:04.479
as far as we know, so...

423
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.271
- What about lipstick?

424
00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:08.562
Uh, Magnolia always
wears the same shade.


425
00:28:08.563 --> 00:28:10.437
It would definitely be in
her apartment somewhere.


426
00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:12.854
- Well, I'm not sure
the lipstick qualifies


427
00:28:12.855 --> 00:28:14.938
as life-giving, but hold on.

428
00:28:19.813 --> 00:28:22.271
No, there's, there's no mention
of lipstick at the scene,


429
00:28:22.272 --> 00:28:23.937
but that doesn't mean that...

430
00:28:23.938 --> 00:28:25.437
- You know what,
Detective? Thank you.


431
00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:27.896
Uh, this is, this is all I
need for now. I'll be in touch.


432
00:28:27.897 --> 00:28:30.646
- Okay, wait, Lucy, look, now
that this is an abduction case,


433
00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:32.480
the stakes are...

434
00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:36.438
Just be careful. You know?

435
00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:39.313
- I always am.

436
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:18.479
Hi, your business
overlooks the river, right?


437
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.271
Yeah, and have you ever had
a mural painted on the back


438
00:30:21.272 --> 00:30:24.063
of your building
by any chance? No?


439
00:30:24.688 --> 00:30:26.272
'K, thanks.

440
00:31:44.522 --> 00:31:47.229
Oh, oh my good...
I'm sorry about that.


441
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.812
- It's all right, Miss. No harm.

442
00:31:52.563 --> 00:31:55.979
Um, are you a guest of
a resident here, ma'am?


443
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.979
- Uh, no, I'm not.

444
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.354
Um, but I-I am just
gonna go inside.


445
00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:02.021
- Due to recent events, ma'am,

446
00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:05.104
building management is
only allowing the residents


447
00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:07.062
and pre-approved guests
to enter the premises.


448
00:32:07.063 --> 00:32:09.521
- Oh, well, um, actually,

449
00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:11.437
I'm a little bit worried
that I'm being followed,


450
00:32:11.438 --> 00:32:14.229
so I just need some
place safe to duck into.


451
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.104
- I'm sorry, miss,
no exceptions.


452
00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:18.437
- Seriously?

453
00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:19.479
- Jen!

454
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.480
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

455
00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:23.312
Gary, this is my
old friend, Jen.


456
00:32:23.313 --> 00:32:25.104
She's gonna join me
upstairs for a few drinks.


457
00:32:25.105 --> 00:32:27.146
- Mr. Brooksbank...
- I know. I know,


458
00:32:27.147 --> 00:32:28.437
I didn't put her
on the list, okay?


459
00:32:28.438 --> 00:32:31.563
But she'll be up and
down in a flash, okay?


460
00:32:47.772 --> 00:32:49.437
Sorry about that.

461
00:32:49.438 --> 00:32:53.437
I uh, heard you talking about
being followed and uh, well,


462
00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:56.437
Gary takes his job
very seriously,


463
00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:58.687
so I thought you
could use some help.


464
00:32:58.688 --> 00:33:01.104
- Thank you, I...
I appreciate it.


465
00:33:01.105 --> 00:33:02.604
That was some quick thinking.

466
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:05.104
- Anyway, you can hang out
here as long as you'd like.


467
00:33:05.105 --> 00:33:06.604
The front desk
can call you a cab


468
00:33:06.605 --> 00:33:09.438
if that's a safer way
to get home. Good luck.


469
00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:12.271
- Hey, um,

470
00:33:12.272 --> 00:33:14.146
did you know her,

471
00:33:14.147 --> 00:33:15.522
the girl that went missing?

472
00:33:16.938 --> 00:33:18.272
- Why?

473
00:33:19.438 --> 00:33:21.104
- My name is Lucy Carver.

474
00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:22.896
I'm a journalist
with The Chronicle.


475
00:33:22.897 --> 00:33:24.646
- So, you're a reporter.

476
00:33:24.647 --> 00:33:27.771
You weren't really being
followed, you just...


477
00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:30.771
You know what? What don't
you mind your own business?


478
00:33:30.772 --> 00:33:34.354
- Wait. You're
right, you are right.


479
00:33:34.355 --> 00:33:37.813
I absolutely should be
minding my own business.


480
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.437
But everyone, the news,
the cops, my editor,


481
00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:45.062
is saying that Magnolia
is this vapid party girl,


482
00:33:45.063 --> 00:33:47.772
and I know that that
can't be true. I know it.


483
00:33:49.438 --> 00:33:51.605
Could you help me set
the record straight?


484
00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:07.312
- Maggie's mom has been
my dad's campaign manager


485
00:34:07.313 --> 00:34:10.687
since his first
city council run.


486
00:34:10.688 --> 00:34:13.646
At fundraisers, it was always
the two of us sneaking off


487
00:34:13.647 --> 00:34:16.104
with some bottle of champagne

488
00:34:16.105 --> 00:34:17.521
that we didn't even
know how to open


489
00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.729
and stirring up trouble.

490
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:24.104
Same prep schools, same college.

491
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.146
Now we live in
the same building.


492
00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:29.605
Our whole lives, we've been
two sides of the same coin.


493
00:34:31.522 --> 00:34:34.313
- And you've always
just been friends?


494
00:34:35.063 --> 00:34:37.854
- Friends and occasionally more.

495
00:34:37.855 --> 00:34:39.479
- Full benefits package?

496
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.104
Something like that.

497
00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:43.937
But I actually

498
00:34:43.938 --> 00:34:47.229
cooled that part of the
relationship off last year.


499
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.937
- How come?

500
00:34:48.938 --> 00:34:52.855
- I thought she was
getting too invested.


501
00:34:53.772 --> 00:34:58.437
But one minute you're
telling the woman


502
00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:00.604
things you've never
told anybody before,


503
00:35:00.605 --> 00:35:02.562
and then the next, you're
running for the hills


504
00:35:02.563 --> 00:35:04.730
saying that she's too emotional.

505
00:35:05.438 --> 00:35:09.022
I hate to be a clichÃ©, but...

506
00:35:12.022 --> 00:35:13.937
- Is there anything that
you want people to know


507
00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:17.855
about Magnolia, or Maggie,
that the news isn't saying?


508
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.896
- That she's kind.

509
00:35:20.897 --> 00:35:23.104
She's a loyal friend.

510
00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:26.271
And that she calls her
mother every Sunday night,


511
00:35:26.272 --> 00:35:29.021
no matter what she's doing.

512
00:35:29.022 --> 00:35:31.146
That's how we knew
something was really wrong,


513
00:35:31.147 --> 00:35:32.938
when she didn't have that call.

514
00:35:34.647 --> 00:35:36.647
Kind of ironic, actually.

515
00:35:38.605 --> 00:35:40.397
- What do you mean by that?

516
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.687
- Well, a few years ago,
Maggie's mom would've been


517
00:35:43.688 --> 00:35:47.229
the last person to know whether
she went missing or not.


518
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.687
They had a falling out
when Maggie didn't wanna go


519
00:35:49.688 --> 00:35:51.813
into politics after college.

520
00:35:53.438 --> 00:35:57.062
Can you imagine how rough
that was for Maggie,


521
00:35:57.063 --> 00:35:58.771
to strike out on her own,

522
00:35:58.772 --> 00:36:01.437
try to create a
life for herself,


523
00:36:01.438 --> 00:36:03.187
and then, to lose the one person

524
00:36:03.188 --> 00:36:05.980
who's supposed to stand
by her, no matter what?


525
00:36:08.605 --> 00:36:11.271
- I guess they
patched things up?


526
00:36:11.272 --> 00:36:14.147
- Yeah. They were
working it out.


527
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.646
Zelda was actually the
one that insisted Maggie


528
00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:19.979
move into a doorman building,

529
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.771
when she was getting nervous
about the anonymous messages


530
00:36:23.772 --> 00:36:26.105
she was getting online.

531
00:36:26.938 --> 00:36:29.521
Actually, that was
getting a lot worse


532
00:36:29.522 --> 00:36:31.147
right before she disappeared.

533
00:36:33.438 --> 00:36:35.563
- Can you say anything
more about that?


534
00:36:36.313 --> 00:36:40.937
- Yeah, she said she was being
followed, in-in real life.


535
00:36:40.938 --> 00:36:43.396
Someone was ducking
around corners


536
00:36:43.397 --> 00:36:45.771
and hiding behind trees.

537
00:36:45.772 --> 00:36:48.521
She could never catch
a good glimpse of them.


538
00:36:48.522 --> 00:36:50.897
But she said she could feel it.

539
00:36:53.605 --> 00:36:55.563
- Did she call the police?

540
00:36:58.438 --> 00:37:00.521
- I don't know.

541
00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:02.647
When she told me, we
had just broken up.


542
00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:06.772
I thought she was just
looking for attention.


543
00:37:09.438 --> 00:37:11.063
She's my best friend.

544
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:14.147
I can't believe I didn't...

545
00:37:20.397 --> 00:37:21.979
- Do you have any
pictures of Magnolia


546
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.437
that I could use in my article?

547
00:37:24.438 --> 00:37:26.437
Maybe one where she's happy?

548
00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:28.813
I can't find anything
like that online.


549
00:37:30.105 --> 00:37:32.021
- Yeah, she's...

550
00:37:32.022 --> 00:37:33.729
she's always doing
that Mona Lisa thing


551
00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.772
in front of the cameras.

552
00:37:36.647 --> 00:37:38.688
Um, I think I should
have something.


553
00:37:40.938 --> 00:37:42.230
Here.

554
00:37:44.813 --> 00:37:48.647
- Where was this taken?
- The Rose Bar downtown.


555
00:37:55.688 --> 00:37:57.646
- Weird question,

556
00:37:57.647 --> 00:37:59.937
do you know where
she got this scarf?


557
00:37:59.938 --> 00:38:02.647
I've just seen it in
a couple of photos.


558
00:38:03.188 --> 00:38:07.104
- Uh, yeah, I think it
was a gift from college,


559
00:38:07.105 --> 00:38:08.938
maybe an ex-boyfriend.

560
00:38:12.272 --> 00:38:15.313
Lucy, you okay?

561
00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:23.896
- Detective, I'm saying
Magnolia had a stalker,


562
00:38:23.897 --> 00:38:26.771
and I-I have a theory
of who it could be.


563
00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:29.271
Look, I think I should
come down to the station.


564
00:38:43.272 --> 00:38:45.562
Actually, Detective...

565
00:38:45.563 --> 00:38:47.855
I think you should come to me.

566
00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:58.937
You said the door
was locked when you got home?


567
00:38:58.938 --> 00:39:02.937
- Yes. And I checked the
back door, the windows,


568
00:39:02.938 --> 00:39:04.979
they're all locked,
just like I left them.


569
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.812
- You feeling okay? Maybe
you should sit down.


570
00:39:06.813 --> 00:39:09.147
- Yeah, no, no, yes. I'm fine.

571
00:39:10.105 --> 00:39:12.563
- All right.
- God, he's getting bolder.


572
00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:16.187
- You said you had a theory
about who it might be.


573
00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:19.021
- Yeah. Um...

574
00:39:19.022 --> 00:39:21.772
Yeah, I mean, obviously,
it's just an idea but...


575
00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:25.147
his name is Roy Kirkpatrick.

576
00:39:26.188 --> 00:39:27.646
- And who is this guy?

577
00:39:27.647 --> 00:39:29.272
- He's my boyfriend.

578
00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:34.312
- Uh, why don't you, uh,

579
00:39:34.313 --> 00:39:36.647
go sweep the rooms
upstairs, all right?


580
00:39:38.563 --> 00:39:39.563
Let's talk.

581
00:39:47.105 --> 00:39:49.937
- I sound crazy. I sound
like... like I'm losing it.


582
00:39:49.938 --> 00:39:53.896
- No one is going there,
but we need proof.


583
00:39:53.897 --> 00:39:55.854
Can you think of anything,
anything at all that connects


584
00:39:55.855 --> 00:39:58.688
Roy to Magnolia? Or
to this break-in?


585
00:40:04.813 --> 00:40:06.437
Tube of lipstick?

586
00:40:06.438 --> 00:40:09.396
- This is the lipstick I wore
the night Roy had me dress up.


587
00:40:09.397 --> 00:40:11.979
And he made me take it off
halfway through the date


588
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.271
because he said it
didn't feel right.


589
00:40:14.272 --> 00:40:17.729
That lipstick lives in a
pile of pens and bobby pins


590
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.187
upstairs in my bedroom.

591
00:40:19.188 --> 00:40:21.229
So, if you're
breaking into my house


592
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.229
and you're looking around
for something to write me


593
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.271
a threatening message with,
why would you go looking


594
00:40:25.272 --> 00:40:28.313
for that lipstick unless
it's part of the message?


595
00:40:30.647 --> 00:40:34.104
- Okay. Uh... I hear
you but I just...


596
00:40:34.105 --> 00:40:36.562
- And I know, I know,
I know it's not enough,


597
00:40:36.563 --> 00:40:40.146
and I understand that
I-I sound paranoid.


598
00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:42.396
I mean, maybe I am paranoid.
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.


599
00:40:42.397 --> 00:40:44.604
Hold on. Hold on now.

600
00:40:44.605 --> 00:40:46.687
Lucy...

601
00:40:46.688 --> 00:40:49.188
Look, you and I, we've worked
together quite a bit, right?


602
00:40:50.105 --> 00:40:52.146
Now, I've always known
you to have a good gut,


603
00:40:52.147 --> 00:40:55.105
and what's more, I've always
known you to trust that gut.


604
00:40:56.938 --> 00:40:59.896
- It's just, what if I'm wrong?

605
00:40:59.897 --> 00:41:01.854
This case is just...

606
00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:05.188
this isn't... it's
not like other cases.


607
00:41:05.813 --> 00:41:08.687
- But if this case
were following me home,


608
00:41:08.688 --> 00:41:11.229
if you were one of my daughters,

609
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.772
I would run this
lead down to be safe.


610
00:41:16.772 --> 00:41:18.437
- Yeah.

611
00:41:20.105 --> 00:41:21.604
Let's run it down.
- Yeah?


612
00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:23.271
- Let's run it.
- Okay, good.


613
00:41:23.272 --> 00:41:25.146
Now look, you are smart,
you are way smarter


614
00:41:25.147 --> 00:41:27.271
than whoever's doing this,
so what did they miss?


615
00:41:27.272 --> 00:41:30.897
I mean what... what
mistake did this guy make?


616
00:41:34.522 --> 00:41:36.563
- The code.
- What code?


617
00:41:37.313 --> 00:41:39.271
- Well, whoever
broke into my house


618
00:41:39.272 --> 00:41:41.937
had to have the code
to my front door,


619
00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:44.980
and the only other
person who has it is Roy.


620
00:41:49.022 --> 00:41:51.480
- Well, it looks like
we've got a suspect to vet.


621
00:41:53.938 --> 00:41:57.188
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, Detective, just...


622
00:41:58.022 --> 00:41:59.187
While you're looking into it,

623
00:41:59.188 --> 00:42:02.313
can you just try
and be discreet?


624
00:42:03.438 --> 00:42:05.230
You know, just in case?

625
00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:07.188
- You got it.

626
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.896
- Roy, what are you doing?

627
00:42:44.897 --> 00:42:46.397
- Did you sic the police on me?

628
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.146
- They said they
would be discreet.


629
00:42:50.147 --> 00:42:52.105
- They came to my office, Luce.

630
00:42:53.772 --> 00:42:55.312
- Oh.
- Yeah.


631
00:42:55.313 --> 00:42:57.937
Do you seriously think that
I kidnapped Magnolia Maines?


632
00:42:57.938 --> 00:42:59.187
Honestly, tell me the truth,

633
00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:01.062
because I would
really like to know.


634
00:43:01.063 --> 00:43:04.521
- Well, Roy, frankly, it's
a lot of coincidences.


635
00:43:04.522 --> 00:43:06.979
The name, the wig, the scarf.

636
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.647
- I was at work the night
Magnolia disappeared.


637
00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:12.104
Something my coworkers had
to confirm with the police


638
00:43:12.105 --> 00:43:14.896
multiple times, so
it is not possible


639
00:43:14.897 --> 00:43:17.021
that I abducted her, okay?

640
00:43:17.022 --> 00:43:19.604
- Okay. You never told me that.

641
00:43:19.605 --> 00:43:20.897
- I didn't think I had to.

642
00:43:22.772 --> 00:43:24.646
- Well, I mean, this is good,

643
00:43:24.647 --> 00:43:26.104
obviously I didn't
want you to...


644
00:43:26.105 --> 00:43:29.812
- Yeah, okay, 'k, 'k,
'k. No. This is over.


645
00:43:29.813 --> 00:43:30.980
- What?

646
00:43:31.522 --> 00:43:33.187
- This is happening.

647
00:43:33.188 --> 00:43:35.479
- No, Roy, I'm sorry.

648
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.604
This case has gotten
so out of hand.


649
00:43:37.605 --> 00:43:39.271
- It's not just the case.

650
00:43:39.272 --> 00:43:40.896
You live inside your work

651
00:43:40.897 --> 00:43:42.937
and you don't care
about anything else.


652
00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:44.897
- That's not true.

653
00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:46.647
- Look at yourself.

654
00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:49.687
You-you, like, how are
you supposed to care


655
00:43:49.688 --> 00:43:51.980
about a relationship, like...

656
00:43:54.188 --> 00:43:56.604
- Roy. Roy, no.
- Luce, no.


657
00:43:56.605 --> 00:43:58.896
- I'm not gonna let you...
I'm not gonna let you leave!


658
00:43:58.897 --> 00:44:00.437
This is not how you
end a relationship!


659
00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:02.271
- You can't threaten me
just because you don't


660
00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.271
want me to leave.
- I'm not threatening you,


661
00:44:04.272 --> 00:44:08.271
I am trying to have a
conversation with you.


662
00:44:08.272 --> 00:44:10.104
- You can't have a conversation
when you're blowing up.


663
00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:12.355
- I'm not blowing up!

664
00:44:14.147 --> 00:44:16.605
- Just stop, Luce, okay? Stop.

665
00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:20.063
Are you gonna let me leave?

666
00:45:06.105 --> 00:45:07.647
- Yeah, Zelda Maines, please.

667
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.480
Oh, really? She just
stepped out... again?


668
00:45:14.272 --> 00:45:15.437
Okay.

669
00:45:15.438 --> 00:45:17.521
Hey, listen, I know
that she's there, okay?


670
00:45:17.522 --> 00:45:19.187
So, why don't you just
hand her the phone


671
00:45:19.188 --> 00:45:21.187
for 30 seconds and then you
can go back to doing whatever


672
00:45:21.188 --> 00:45:25.022
it is that you do. I
don't... Hello? Hello?


673
00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:29.397
Nice.

674
00:45:44.605 --> 00:45:46.604
- Something interesting
going on over here?


675
00:45:46.605 --> 00:45:49.104
- Yeah, Zelda Maines'
office is just giving me


676
00:45:49.105 --> 00:45:51.354
the runaround again.
Uh, but it-it's okay,


677
00:45:51.355 --> 00:45:54.104
I've got some family members
I can contact, so all good.


678
00:45:54.105 --> 00:45:56.355
- Tell me what's going on
with you, or you're fired.


679
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.729
- That's illegal.

680
00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.438
- I don't care.

681
00:46:05.897 --> 00:46:09.812
So, he actually said the
words, "This is happening"?


682
00:46:09.813 --> 00:46:11.271
- It's kinda hard to forget.

683
00:46:11.272 --> 00:46:14.021
- That's... I mean,
Lucy, that's...


684
00:46:14.022 --> 00:46:16.396
- Odette, I know what
you're gonna say.


685
00:46:16.397 --> 00:46:18.271
I did exactly what
you told me not to do.


686
00:46:18.272 --> 00:46:20.187
I went looking for a
story in my own life,


687
00:46:20.188 --> 00:46:21.979
and in the process, I torpedoed

688
00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.271
the only real relationship
I've ever had. You know what?


689
00:46:24.272 --> 00:46:26.104
I'm just gonna call
him. I think I just...


690
00:46:26.105 --> 00:46:27.855
- No, no, no. Lucy
Carver, do not.


691
00:46:29.855 --> 00:46:31.687
Oh, my God.

692
00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.812
Roy sucks.

693
00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:37.104
I'm sorry, but it's true.

694
00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:40.354
Forget Magnolia,
forget this job.


695
00:46:40.355 --> 00:46:44.397
You did what you needed to do
to keep yourself safe, right?


696
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:47.437
And he couldn't understand that?

697
00:46:47.438 --> 00:46:51.521
Honestly. And after all the
times he cancelled plans,


698
00:46:51.522 --> 00:46:53.604
made you feel like your time
wasn't as important as his,


699
00:46:53.605 --> 00:46:56.062
that your passions
weren't good enough?


700
00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:57.604
And now this?

701
00:46:57.605 --> 00:47:00.563
Why on earth would you
ever want him back?


702
00:47:02.855 --> 00:47:04.979
- Guess I did kind of always

703
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.021
feel like he never
really got me.


704
00:47:07.022 --> 00:47:09.646
- Yes, yes, exactly.

705
00:47:09.647 --> 00:47:13.562
- I always assumed that was
because I'm not cool enough.


706
00:47:13.563 --> 00:47:15.896
- Oh, ridiculous.
- Or sexy enough or...


707
00:47:15.897 --> 00:47:17.437
- Absurd!
- And then,


708
00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:20.146
there's all of the
Magnolia stuff.


709
00:47:20.147 --> 00:47:23.605
- Oh, so that's
actually another thing.


710
00:47:24.605 --> 00:47:27.312
You're off the Magnolia story.
- What? Why?


711
00:47:27.313 --> 00:47:28.812
- You've got enough
on your plate


712
00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:31.437
with this whole Roy mess, and
don't think I didn't notice


713
00:47:31.438 --> 00:47:33.229
the part of the story
where you're being targeted


714
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.229
by Magnolia's stalker?
- Yes!


715
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.937
Because he's afraid
that I'm getting close.


716
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:40.271
- It's too dangerous.
- No!


717
00:47:40.272 --> 00:47:44.354
If her stalker is following
me and I can flush him out,


718
00:47:44.355 --> 00:47:45.937
then that could
be our only chance


719
00:47:45.938 --> 00:47:47.437
to find Magnolia alive!

720
00:47:47.438 --> 00:47:50.562
- Lucy, this isn't
you. This isn't smart.


721
00:47:50.563 --> 00:47:52.646
You've generated a lot
of interest in this case.


722
00:47:52.647 --> 00:47:55.480
Why do you need to put your
life on the line for it, too?


723
00:47:56.563 --> 00:47:59.522
What's going on here? Really.

724
00:48:03.688 --> 00:48:05.521
- Couple weeks ago,

725
00:48:05.522 --> 00:48:10.313
I sent my article to my mom and
I never heard back from her.


726
00:48:13.438 --> 00:48:15.271
And...

727
00:48:15.272 --> 00:48:18.604
And I know that she
is still angry with me


728
00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:22.271
because I left her for a career

729
00:48:22.272 --> 00:48:26.355
after she gave up
everything for me.


730
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.104
- And you think you
can get her attention


731
00:48:29.105 --> 00:48:30.938
by finding a missing girl?

732
00:48:33.438 --> 00:48:34.605
- No.

733
00:48:36.272 --> 00:48:39.855
I may never speak
with my mom again.


734
00:48:41.313 --> 00:48:44.771
But Magnolia and her mother,

735
00:48:44.772 --> 00:48:49.562
they had just started
to patch things up


736
00:48:49.563 --> 00:48:52.522
with each other when
she disappeared.


737
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.396
And... I can't let their
story end like that.


738
00:48:57.397 --> 00:48:59.104
I just can't!

739
00:48:59.105 --> 00:49:01.229
I have to find her

740
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.897
and I think I'm the
only one that can.


741
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.229
- So, how exactly would you plan

742
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.772
on flushing out this stalker?

743
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.772
- I'm glad you asked.

744
00:50:20.938 --> 00:50:22.729
Hey.

745
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:23.937
- Hey.

746
00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:27.062
- I uh, I forgot my
membership card at home.


747
00:50:27.063 --> 00:50:28.729
Could you...

748
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.772
- Don't sweat it.
I'll take care of you.


749
00:50:36.938 --> 00:50:38.896
But that's what most
people don't understand


750
00:50:38.897 --> 00:50:42.438
about cryptocurrency, you have
to bet big if you wanna win big.


751
00:50:42.813 --> 00:50:45.271
- And you've been a member
here for how long again?


752
00:50:45.272 --> 00:50:47.396
- Pfft, pretty
much my whole life.


753
00:50:47.397 --> 00:50:49.021
I mean, the old man sorta
keeps the place running,


754
00:50:49.022 --> 00:50:51.104
you know what I mean?

755
00:50:51.105 --> 00:50:54.730
That's uh, actually how I know
all the best dark corners.


756
00:50:56.105 --> 00:50:58.562
- You probably know all
the best gossip, too.


757
00:50:58.563 --> 00:51:03.104
- Oh, yeah. Half the posers in
this place are secretly like,


758
00:51:03.105 --> 00:51:05.271
ten seconds from bankruptcy.

759
00:51:05.272 --> 00:51:06.563
- Right.

760
00:51:08.188 --> 00:51:09.979
Wasn't that girl
who went missing


761
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.271
a member here? 
Margaret or...

762
00:51:12.272 --> 00:51:15.187
- Oh, Maggie? Man, she
knows how to party.


763
00:51:15.188 --> 00:51:17.271
Or she knew.

764
00:51:17.272 --> 00:51:19.062
We used to date, you know?

765
00:51:19.063 --> 00:51:20.271
- Really?

766
00:51:20.272 --> 00:51:22.521
- Well, she wanted to date.

767
00:51:22.522 --> 00:51:24.271
I had to let her down easy.

768
00:51:24.272 --> 00:51:26.771
I just don't go for those
party girl types, you know?


769
00:51:26.772 --> 00:51:29.396
I like my women to
have a bit of a brain.


770
00:51:29.397 --> 00:51:32.604
- Good for you.
So, tell me more


771
00:51:32.605 --> 00:51:33.854
about your relationship
with Maggie.


772
00:51:33.855 --> 00:51:35.312
- Lucy...

773
00:51:35.313 --> 00:51:36.521
- Roy.

774
00:51:36.522 --> 00:51:38.730
Hey, we're
having a conversation.


775
00:51:41.438 --> 00:51:43.397
What the hell?

776
00:51:45.647 --> 00:51:47.479
- What're you doin' here?

777
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.229
- It's none of your business
what I'm doing here.


778
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:53.854
- Are you following me?
- What? No, of course not.


779
00:51:53.855 --> 00:51:56.771
- Why do you look like this?
- Like what?


780
00:51:56.772 --> 00:51:58.812
- Are you so obsessed
with Magnolia Maines now


781
00:51:58.813 --> 00:52:00.063
that you're dressing like her?

782
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.771
- What? I'm... I'm
not dressed like her.


783
00:52:04.772 --> 00:52:06.687
- Okay then, what is this?
- Don't... don't touch me!


784
00:52:06.688 --> 00:52:08.937
- Okay.
- And you gave me this scarf,


785
00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:10.562
Roy, so unless it has
something to do with Magnolia


786
00:52:10.563 --> 00:52:12.354
that I just don't know about...

787
00:52:12.355 --> 00:52:14.437
- Please, listen to yourself.
- And what are you doing here?


788
00:52:14.438 --> 00:52:16.437
How do I know that
you're not following me?


789
00:52:16.438 --> 00:52:18.062
- Uh, the Rose Bar
is the big client


790
00:52:18.063 --> 00:52:20.105
that my firm's been
pitching to, remember?


791
00:52:22.355 --> 00:52:24.896
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, and those guys


792
00:52:24.897 --> 00:52:27.271
are in charge of all the
club's legal financing.


793
00:52:27.272 --> 00:52:29.937
And if you paid attention to
anyone other than yourself,


794
00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:32.021
maybe you'd remember that
that's what I was working


795
00:52:32.022 --> 00:52:34.104
like crazy on for
the last few weeks.


796
00:52:34.105 --> 00:52:38.104
- Okay, Roy, I'm-I'm
sorry. I forgot. I...


797
00:52:38.105 --> 00:52:40.104
- You know what? Whatever.

798
00:52:40.105 --> 00:52:41.937
Now, I'm not gonna blow
this meeting standing here


799
00:52:41.938 --> 00:52:43.021
arguing with you.

800
00:52:43.022 --> 00:52:45.022
And don't forget
to send my stuff.


801
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.230
She's having a hard
time moving on.


802
00:53:08.688 --> 00:53:11.146
Maggie? Maggie!

803
00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.563
- Get back!
- Hey!


804
00:53:13.313 --> 00:53:14.521
Lucy?
- Dan!


805
00:53:14.522 --> 00:53:15.604
- What are you...

806
00:53:15.605 --> 00:53:18.104
Why do you...

807
00:53:18.105 --> 00:53:20.562
Your scarf. I
-I thought...

808
00:53:20.563 --> 00:53:22.854
- You thought that I was her.

809
00:53:22.855 --> 00:53:27.146
Oh, Dan, I am so sorry. I di...

810
00:53:27.147 --> 00:53:30.937
I wasn't trying to
confuse anybody, I just...


811
00:53:30.938 --> 00:53:33.271
You know what? Can you please
just forget I was here?


812
00:53:33.272 --> 00:53:37.437
I'm-I'm leaving anyway.
I'm-I'm really, really sorry.


813
00:53:37.438 --> 00:53:39.479
- No, it's okay.

814
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.187
Look, ever since
Maggie disappeared,


815
00:53:41.188 --> 00:53:44.146
I can't explain half the
things I've been doing


816
00:53:44.147 --> 00:53:46.437
to keep my head above water.

817
00:53:46.438 --> 00:53:49.313
Whatever you're doing here,
I'm sure it's for good reasons.


818
00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:52.688
- I can't give up on her.

819
00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:55.188
- I know the feeling.

820
00:53:58.897 --> 00:54:02.647
So, get any good leads tonight?

821
00:54:04.438 --> 00:54:07.312
- This was technically
my last lead


822
00:54:07.313 --> 00:54:09.812
and it was a bit of a bust.

823
00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:12.146
- Have you been able to
talk to Maggie's mom yet?


824
00:54:12.147 --> 00:54:14.229
- Zelda?

825
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:15.646
No.

826
00:54:15.647 --> 00:54:17.230
She won't even return my calls.

827
00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:22.021
- Okay. Well, look, I-I
would never go against


828
00:54:22.022 --> 00:54:24.354
the wishes of the
great Zelda Maines,


829
00:54:24.355 --> 00:54:28.729
but let's just say, if
I happen to accidentally


830
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.771
put your name on my
building's guest list


831
00:54:30.772 --> 00:54:34.104
for tomorrow at around 2 p.m.,

832
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.187
I wouldn't be able to control
who you might bump into


833
00:54:36.188 --> 00:54:38.062
in the lobby, if
they're there to, say,


834
00:54:38.063 --> 00:54:39.813
visit their
daughter's apartment?


835
00:54:41.105 --> 00:54:45.771
- I mean, if you were
to accidentally do that,


836
00:54:45.772 --> 00:54:47.437
I would be very grateful.

837
00:54:47.438 --> 00:54:48.730
- Hmm.

838
00:54:50.022 --> 00:54:54.230
- You know, you don't have
to keep helping me like this.


839
00:54:54.938 --> 00:54:56.813
- I need to know what happened.

840
00:54:57.855 --> 00:55:00.771
I don't know, maybe there's
just something about you


841
00:55:00.772 --> 00:55:03.772
I find... trustworthy.

842
00:55:06.938 --> 00:55:08.480
Look, can I give you a lift?

843
00:55:09.355 --> 00:55:12.854
- Um, no, no, I parked
just a couple blocks away,


844
00:55:12.855 --> 00:55:15.146
but thanks anyway.

845
00:55:15.147 --> 00:55:16.271
- Yeah.

846
00:55:16.272 --> 00:55:17.897
- Thank you for everything.

847
00:56:00.938 --> 00:56:03.437
Oh my!

848
00:56:06.105 --> 00:56:08.897
Get off! Stop!

849
00:56:13.605 --> 00:56:15.188
Back off!

850
00:56:31.022 --> 00:56:34.355
- So, it wasn't
someone you know?


851
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.521
- I don't know.

852
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.937
I mean, if he was afraid
that I might recognize him,


853
00:56:41.938 --> 00:56:43.979
he could have been trying
to disguise his voice.


854
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.812
- You sure you don't
wanna go to the hospital?


855
00:56:45.813 --> 00:56:48.355
We can give you a ride.
- No. No, no, I'm okay.


856
00:56:49.313 --> 00:56:51.813
- Maybe someone
nearby saw something.


857
00:56:55.688 --> 00:56:57.229
Lucy, what...

858
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:58.979
- Detective, I know
what you're gonna say.


859
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.354
- What possessed you to chase
after a violent stalker?


860
00:57:01.355 --> 00:57:03.396
- What was I supposed to do?

861
00:57:03.397 --> 00:57:07.730
He was on me. I wasn't just
gonna let him get away. Ugh.


862
00:57:09.313 --> 00:57:10.522
Honestly...

863
00:57:11.688 --> 00:57:14.604
I don't know. I've
been feeling...


864
00:57:14.605 --> 00:57:17.272
differently lately.
- Different how?


865
00:57:19.647 --> 00:57:21.105
- I'm angry.

866
00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.937
This guy invaded Magnolia's life

867
00:57:24.938 --> 00:57:28.479
and all anyone cares about is
whether she was pretty enough


868
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.854
to, to be a tragedy

869
00:57:30.855 --> 00:57:33.979
or messy enough to
have had it coming.


870
00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.521
And now he thinks he can
do the same thing to me!


871
00:57:36.522 --> 00:57:38.812
Like, just because I've got
no one else fighting for me,


872
00:57:38.813 --> 00:57:40.437
I'm gonna...

873
00:57:40.438 --> 00:57:42.854
well, lie down and
take it. Well, I'm not!


874
00:57:42.855 --> 00:57:44.979
I'll fight for myself!

875
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.812
And I will fight
for Magnolia too,


876
00:57:46.813 --> 00:57:48.271
even if I'm the
only one doing it.


877
00:57:48.272 --> 00:57:51.396
- You know you're not the
only one fighting for you.


878
00:57:51.397 --> 00:57:53.021
And just having the
moral high ground


879
00:57:53.022 --> 00:57:55.771
doesn't keep you safe,
so stop being stupid,


880
00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.562
or the next time,
you'll end up with more


881
00:57:57.563 --> 00:57:59.147
than a few scrapes and bruises.

882
00:59:04.855 --> 00:59:06.604
- This is Lucy Carver.

883
00:59:06.605 --> 00:59:07.979
That's how you answer

884
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.687
the phone? So impersonal.

885
00:59:11.688 --> 00:59:12.937
- That's how I answer my phone

886
00:59:12.938 --> 00:59:14.771
when I don't
recognize the caller,


887
00:59:14.772 --> 00:59:16.397
Mr. Brooksbank.

888
00:59:17.522 --> 00:59:18.979
How did you get this number?

889
00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.437
- Oh, you know,
connections, strings.


890
00:59:22.438 --> 00:59:25.354
Anyway, I just wanted to
call to see if you were okay.


891
00:59:25.355 --> 00:59:27.104
They're saying someone
got attacked near the club


892
00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:29.104
just after I saw you.

893
00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:31.937
- Yeah. Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

894
00:59:31.938 --> 00:59:34.021
I mean, my ultramarathon
career is over


895
00:59:34.022 --> 00:59:37.021
but that's just a silver lining.

896
00:59:37.022 --> 00:59:39.896
- So, it was you. 
What happened?

897
00:59:39.897 --> 00:59:41.812
- It's a long story,

898
00:59:41.813 --> 00:59:44.438
and uh, I'm actually
kinda busy at the moment.


899
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.437
I'm just chasing down this lead

900
00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:50.271
that you definitely
don't know anything about


901
00:59:50.272 --> 00:59:52.062
and didn't assist
with in any way.


902
00:59:52.063 --> 00:59:55.021
Okay. Well, then,

903
00:59:55.022 --> 00:59:57.562
that means we have to
go for coffee sometime


904
00:59:57.563 --> 01:00:00.937
and you can fill me in on
all the sordid details.


905
01:00:00.938 --> 01:00:03.605
- Sounds good. 
I'll call you.

906
01:00:37.563 --> 01:00:40.479
- Ms. Maines? Ms. Maines,
I'm sorry to bother you.


907
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.438
My name is Lucy Carver.

908
01:00:41.439 --> 01:00:42.937
I'm a journalist
with The Chronicle.


909
01:00:42.938 --> 01:00:44.355
- No comment.

910
01:00:45.272 --> 01:00:48.230
- Your daughter's stalker
attacked me last night.


911
01:00:51.313 --> 01:00:53.188
- How do you know about that?

912
01:00:53.688 --> 01:00:55.980
- Maybe we should talk upstairs.

913
01:01:07.772 --> 01:01:10.229
- Don't touch anything inside.

914
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:12.562
- Is it still an
active crime scene?


915
01:01:12.563 --> 01:01:14.187
- No.

916
01:01:14.188 --> 01:01:16.437
But I wouldn't want you
making a mess for Magnolia


917
01:01:16.438 --> 01:01:19.063
to come home to
once she returns.


918
01:01:27.355 --> 01:01:29.562
Those crime scene analysts
really did a number


919
01:01:29.563 --> 01:01:31.687
on this place. The
mattress and the couch


920
01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.437
had to be replaced completely.

921
01:01:33.438 --> 01:01:34.730
- Why?

922
01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:37.397
- They test for fluids.

923
01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:40.312
I hope you don't need me
to spell out the details


924
01:01:40.313 --> 01:01:42.021
of a sexually
motivated abduction


925
01:01:42.022 --> 01:01:43.271
more clearly than that.

926
01:01:43.272 --> 01:01:46.105
- No, that's... that's
fine, I understand.


927
01:01:47.813 --> 01:01:49.563
Did they find anything?

928
01:01:50.938 --> 01:01:52.313
- No.

929
01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.521
You can tell me how you know

930
01:01:58.522 --> 01:02:00.688
about my family's
private affairs now.


931
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:04.522
- Uh, right. Well...

932
01:02:05.813 --> 01:02:07.812
I have been investigating
your daughter's disappearance


933
01:02:07.813 --> 01:02:10.062
ever since the news broke,

934
01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.979
although I don't
know if investigating


935
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.438
is quite the right word.

936
01:02:15.647 --> 01:02:19.187
Frankly, Zelda, or ma'am,

937
01:02:19.188 --> 01:02:21.813
I haven't been able to
think about anything else.


938
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.729
I believe that her stalker is
afraid that I'm getting close


939
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.187
to cracking the case.

940
01:02:31.188 --> 01:02:33.187
Tried to attack me last night.

941
01:02:33.188 --> 01:02:37.437
And I sort of chased
him, or I... I tried to.


942
01:02:37.438 --> 01:02:39.437
Good for you.

943
01:02:39.438 --> 01:02:42.062
Magnolia would have
done the same thing.


944
01:02:42.063 --> 01:02:43.312
She wouldn't have
injured herself, though.


945
01:02:43.313 --> 01:02:44.980
She's a wonderful athlete.

946
01:02:45.563 --> 01:02:48.104
- Can you tell me more
about your daughter?


947
01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:49.563
What was she like growing up?

948
01:02:51.397 --> 01:02:53.438
- I'm not speaking
on the record.


949
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.812
- Okay, but this...
- Do you have any idea


950
01:02:57.813 --> 01:03:01.605
how much my daughter suffered
before her abduction, Lucy?


951
01:03:02.355 --> 01:03:05.229
Her privacy was invaded.

952
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.771
Her peace of mind shattered.
And then, her home,


953
01:03:07.772 --> 01:03:09.104
where she should feel safe.

954
01:03:09.105 --> 01:03:11.271
- It's terrifying.

955
01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:16.230
To be violated like
that... is terrifying.


956
01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:17.938
I know.

957
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.187
- Then you should understand
why I have no desire


958
01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:25.522
in helping turning her
nightmare into a media circus.


959
01:03:28.313 --> 01:03:30.272
- Well, what if I don't
quote you in the article?


960
01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.437
You know what?

961
01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:35.104
My editor's going to
kill me for saying this,


962
01:03:35.105 --> 01:03:36.604
but let's just...

963
01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:39.522
We'll-we'll forget about
the story, all right?


964
01:03:40.188 --> 01:03:42.271
I want to find Magnolia.

965
01:03:42.272 --> 01:03:44.397
I need your help to do it.

966
01:03:46.188 --> 01:03:47.730
- What do you need to know?

967
01:03:50.605 --> 01:03:52.604
- I'm just gonna
take some notes.


968
01:03:52.605 --> 01:03:54.479
Was the last few
months the first time


969
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.147
one of Magnolia's admirers
took things too far?


970
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:59.730
- No.

971
01:04:00.813 --> 01:04:02.396
There was a boy in college

972
01:04:02.397 --> 01:04:06.271
that had to be removed from
her dorm and her classes.


973
01:04:06.272 --> 01:04:09.604
I don't think things
escalated past that, though.


974
01:04:09.605 --> 01:04:12.437
- And do you remember
anything else about that?


975
01:04:12.438 --> 01:04:15.896
Did Magnolia make an
official report, maybe?


976
01:04:15.897 --> 01:04:17.397
Anything that I could look up?

977
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.396
- I don't.

978
01:04:20.397 --> 01:04:22.604
Honestly, I suspected
she wasn't giving me


979
01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:25.397
all the details at the time.
We weren't close back then.


980
01:04:30.105 --> 01:04:31.938
Those years we lost.

981
01:04:33.397 --> 01:04:35.354
If I could do it over,

982
01:04:35.355 --> 01:04:36.855
I would. I...

983
01:04:42.105 --> 01:04:43.855
I would behave differently.

984
01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.397
- You should tell her that.

985
01:04:49.022 --> 01:04:50.854
When she's back home.

986
01:04:50.855 --> 01:04:52.396
- You know,

987
01:04:52.397 --> 01:04:55.812
Magnolia used to keep her
diaries under her bed.


988
01:04:55.813 --> 01:04:58.397
All of them, back to
when she was a child.


989
01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:01.729
She might have written
about the trouble


990
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.438
with the boy in college,
if it mattered at the time.


991
01:05:11.272 --> 01:05:12.313
- Thank you.

992
01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:18.854
- Have you found what
you're looking for yet?


993
01:06:18.855 --> 01:06:21.437
I have meetings.
- Yeah. I-I mean, um...


994
01:06:21.438 --> 01:06:22.980
I'm not sure.

995
01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:27.687
In this diary from
Magnolia's sophomore year,


996
01:06:27.688 --> 01:06:31.437
she mentions someone named
JD. Does that sound familiar?


997
01:06:31.438 --> 01:06:34.313
- Right. Yes.

998
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:36.729
That's the boy she
had problems with.


999
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.271
I remember now.

1000
01:06:38.272 --> 01:06:41.937
- Uh, and do you think
JD is a-a nickname?


1001
01:06:41.938 --> 01:06:44.229
- It was so long ago. I...

1002
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.771
I think the D stood
for Dave or Dean or...


1003
01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:52.729
It's no use trying to remember
now, really. I need to...


1004
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:54.937
- Right, yeah, it's no problem.

1005
01:06:54.938 --> 01:06:56.730
I'll take this with me.

1006
01:06:57.688 --> 01:07:01.563
Or, or I will take some
pictures of some of the pages.


1007
01:07:02.438 --> 01:07:04.397
- I'll be waiting
for you outside.


1008
01:07:31.938 --> 01:07:33.480
- Zelda?

1009
01:07:37.938 --> 01:07:38.980
Zelda?

1010
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:44.979
Thank you for speaking
with me today.


1011
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.437
You won't regret it.

1012
01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:47.980
- I certainly hope not.

1013
01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:50.937
- I'm gonna give you my card,

1014
01:07:50.938 --> 01:07:54.771
just in case you remember
something or if you wanna talk.


1015
01:07:54.772 --> 01:07:58.437
- I won't. But it's always
important to leave your card.


1016
01:07:58.438 --> 01:08:00.979
That's just good politics.

1017
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.147
Nice font.

1018
01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:04.688
You know the way out.

1019
01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:13.854
- That better be the sweet sound

1020
01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:15.522
of a source blowing
up your phone.


1021
01:08:16.272 --> 01:08:20.604
- Kind of a source. Kind
of also a date, maybe.


1022
01:08:20.605 --> 01:08:23.187
- Oh, yes. Tell me
absolutely everything.


1023
01:08:23.188 --> 01:08:24.271
I love a good rebound.

1024
01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:26.354
- Oh, he's not a rebound.

1025
01:08:26.355 --> 01:08:28.146
He's Brooksbank.

1026
01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:31.271
But that's not even the
biggest news of the day.


1027
01:08:31.272 --> 01:08:33.021
Guess who tracked
down Zelda Maines?


1028
01:08:33.022 --> 01:08:35.104
- Wait, wait, wait,
Brooksbank like the Midwest


1029
01:08:35.105 --> 01:08:36.687
political dynasty Brooksbanks?

1030
01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:38.479
The ones who employ
Magnolia's mother?


1031
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.979
- Yes. But don't worry,

1032
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.187
I'm not gonna go out with
him until I'm done my story.


1033
01:08:42.188 --> 01:08:44.896
And even then, I don't
know, I... I don't know.


1034
01:08:44.897 --> 01:08:47.729
I haven't decided yet.
- Oh, you will go out with him.


1035
01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:51.187
Is it the senator himself
or good old junior?


1036
01:08:51.188 --> 01:08:53.854
- No, nobody calls him that.

1037
01:08:53.855 --> 01:08:56.812
- When I started on
the city hall beat,


1038
01:08:56.813 --> 01:08:58.562
he was just a teen getting
busted with fireworks


1039
01:08:58.563 --> 01:09:00.687
on the campaign trail.
We all called him that.


1040
01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:02.646
Easier to tell him
apart from the elder


1041
01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:04.937
Joshua Brooksbank. But I
guess since he grew up,


1042
01:09:04.938 --> 01:09:06.479
he started going
by his middle name.


1043
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.855
- Daniel.

1044
01:09:08.605 --> 01:09:10.063
- Yeah, that's it.

1045
01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.646
Hey, are you okay over there?

1046
01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:16.771
- Dan's full name is
Joshua Daniel Brooksbank.


1047
01:09:16.772 --> 01:09:20.104
Oh, how did I not realize that?
- It's not a big deal.


1048
01:09:20.105 --> 01:09:21.562
You would've caught
it in fact checking.


1049
01:09:21.563 --> 01:09:23.812
- No, you don't
understand. Listen to this.


1050
01:09:23.813 --> 01:09:27.646
"JD came by my room again
today while I was in class.


1051
01:09:27.647 --> 01:09:29.979
This time he let himself in.

1052
01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.812
I wouldn't have even
known if I hadn't noticed


1053
01:09:31.813 --> 01:09:34.147
my underwear drawer was open."

1054
01:09:34.813 --> 01:09:37.812
Yikes! What is that?

1055
01:09:37.813 --> 01:09:39.604
This is Magnolia's diary

1056
01:09:39.605 --> 01:09:41.187
from college, the year
that she had to have a boy


1057
01:09:41.188 --> 01:09:44.021
removed from her dorms and
classes for harassment.


1058
01:09:44.022 --> 01:09:47.854
And there's more, there's more.
Um, "I've tried being polite


1059
01:09:47.855 --> 01:09:50.062
and I think that's
only making it worse.


1060
01:09:50.063 --> 01:09:51.604
But how will JD respond

1061
01:09:51.605 --> 01:09:53.854
if I tell him just
how gross I find him?"


1062
01:09:53.855 --> 01:09:55.729
- And you think the JD
she's referring to is...


1063
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:57.687
Oh, my God!

1064
01:09:57.688 --> 01:09:59.647
- Okay, okay, my office, now!
- Oh, my God!


1065
01:10:02.063 --> 01:10:04.312
This is why he wants
to go out with me.


1066
01:10:04.313 --> 01:10:06.104
Dan is Magnolia's stalker.

1067
01:10:06.105 --> 01:10:09.021
The only reason he wants to
see me is to finish me off.


1068
01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:11.354
- Let's not panic. I've been
reading your story notes


1069
01:10:11.355 --> 01:10:13.771
and you said Dan and
Magnolia had a relationship.


1070
01:10:13.772 --> 01:10:15.854
Why would she date someone
who stalked her in college?


1071
01:10:15.855 --> 01:10:18.312
- They only had a
relationship, according to him.


1072
01:10:18.313 --> 01:10:20.437
No one else has
corroborated that.


1073
01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:22.729
I mean, I just assumed
that it was private,


1074
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.271
but clearly, it was a lie
to throw me off track.


1075
01:10:26.272 --> 01:10:29.812
"I don't mean to be a clichÃ©,
but one minute I'm into her,


1076
01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:31.604
and the next minute, I'm
running for the hills."


1077
01:10:31.605 --> 01:10:34.604
Like, what
man talks like that?


1078
01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:37.147
- There could still be
another explanation.


1079
01:10:37.897 --> 01:10:40.646
- I bet he moved into that
building to be closer to her.


1080
01:10:40.647 --> 01:10:42.437
And she's been afraid
of him for years,


1081
01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.229
but she was too
terrified to come forward


1082
01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:46.271
with his identity because
it might jeopardize


1083
01:10:46.272 --> 01:10:50.812
her mother's career! Why
did I fall for him? I...


1084
01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:53.771
- Lucy, hold on. You
need to call the police.


1085
01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:55.771
- Yes. But first, I'm gonna...
- No, no!


1086
01:10:55.772 --> 01:10:58.771
The time for Nancy Drew
shenanigans is over.


1087
01:10:58.772 --> 01:11:00.187
If what you're saying is true,

1088
01:11:00.188 --> 01:11:02.812
then this man is
not only a stalker


1089
01:11:02.813 --> 01:11:05.896
and a possible murderer, he's
also a charming sociopath


1090
01:11:05.897 --> 01:11:07.937
with money and political clout,

1091
01:11:07.938 --> 01:11:10.104
and he knows you're
a threat to him.


1092
01:11:10.105 --> 01:11:11.729
So, what you're gonna
do is you're gonna


1093
01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.271
call your police contact,
you're gonna tell them


1094
01:11:13.272 --> 01:11:15.437
everything you know, and then,
you're gonna go lock yourself


1095
01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.937
in at home until we
know you're safe.


1096
01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:19.437
Ah! If you don't
wanna be alone,


1097
01:11:19.438 --> 01:11:21.104
you can come stay with me.

1098
01:11:21.105 --> 01:11:23.272
But those are your
only two options.


1099
01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:25.105
- You're right.

1100
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:27.355
Yeah, okay.

1101
01:11:52.772 --> 01:11:54.647
And you're sure this okay?

1102
01:11:55.438 --> 01:11:56.813
Okay, thanks.

1103
01:11:58.688 --> 01:12:00.479
Hey, listen,

1104
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.230
I know what I said, but... I
really don't wanna be alone.


1105
01:12:06.438 --> 01:12:09.522
All right, I'm leaving
now, so I'll see you soon.


1106
01:12:10.438 --> 01:12:12.771
You've reached
Lucy Carver's voicemail.


1107
01:12:12.772 --> 01:12:14.437
Please leave a message.

1108
01:12:14.438 --> 01:12:15.812
Lucy,

1109
01:12:15.813 --> 01:12:17.062
it's Detective Webb.

1110
01:12:17.063 --> 01:12:18.729
Good news.

1111
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:21.437
We arrested Dan
Brooksbank an hour ago.


1112
01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.896
My guys found a diamond
earring belonging to Magnolia


1113
01:12:23.897 --> 01:12:26.396
in Dan's apartment.

1114
01:12:26.397 --> 01:12:28.021
He says it must have been
there since they've dated,


1115
01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:29.979
but we've got him in
interrogation now so,


1116
01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.188
the real story
should come out soon.


1117
01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:34.521
Anyway, it's not over yet,

1118
01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:36.604
but I just wanted
to let you know.


1119
01:12:36.605 --> 01:12:38.188
You're safe now, Lucy.

1120
01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.937
- Hey.
- Hey.


1121
01:12:42.814 --> 01:12:45.021
Thank you for
agreeing to see me.


1122
01:12:45.022 --> 01:12:48.521
I know our last
conversation wasn't... um...


1123
01:12:48.522 --> 01:12:50.313
Anyway, I brought
some of your stuff.


1124
01:12:51.688 --> 01:12:53.105
- Come on in.

1125
01:13:01.105 --> 01:13:03.687
- You shouldn't be alone until
that psychopath's behind bars.


1126
01:13:03.688 --> 01:13:05.437
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.


1127
01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:08.604
- I just hope he admits to
what he did to Magnolia.


1128
01:13:08.605 --> 01:13:10.355
You know, even if she is...

1129
01:13:11.772 --> 01:13:13.937
I just hope we get some answers.

1130
01:13:13.938 --> 01:13:16.438
- Yeah, it would be nice
to get some closure.


1131
01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:24.521
- So, now that the
case is wrapping up,


1132
01:13:24.522 --> 01:13:26.438
I figured that we should talk.

1133
01:13:29.813 --> 01:13:32.687
- Uh, Lucy, just to be clear,

1134
01:13:32.688 --> 01:13:34.604
I care about you,
but I don't think


1135
01:13:34.605 --> 01:13:36.312
we should get back together.

1136
01:13:36.313 --> 01:13:39.022
- Good, me neither.

1137
01:13:42.355 --> 01:13:44.937
You were right when you
said that I'm too involved


1138
01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:47.980
with my work and I
can't take care of you.


1139
01:13:48.688 --> 01:13:50.687
But the thing is,

1140
01:13:50.688 --> 01:13:52.730
you don't need me to
take care of you, do you?


1141
01:13:54.438 --> 01:13:56.187
- Yeah, no, I guess not.

1142
01:13:56.188 --> 01:14:00.187
- But Magnolia, she needed me.

1143
01:14:00.188 --> 01:14:02.104
And if I hadn't kept
going with the case


1144
01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:05.187
after you told me to
drop it, then who knows,


1145
01:14:05.188 --> 01:14:08.021
Dan would still be out there
sipping drinks at the Rose Bar


1146
01:14:08.022 --> 01:14:11.146
and doing God knows what
to women in the future.


1147
01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.187
So...

1148
01:14:13.188 --> 01:14:15.521
I'm sorry that things ended
the way they did between us,


1149
01:14:15.522 --> 01:14:19.437
but... I have to thank you.

1150
01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:22.022
You helped me set my
priorities straight.


1151
01:14:22.938 --> 01:14:26.979
- Good. Um, well,

1152
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.396
our teas are getting cold,
so I'll go boil some more.


1153
01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:30.854
- Okay.

1154
01:14:30.855 --> 01:14:33.146
- Hey, I am surprised
that Dan had the brains


1155
01:14:33.147 --> 01:14:35.105
to pull that whole
thing off, though.


1156
01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:43.397
- What do you mean
surprised? Do you know Dan?


1157
01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.437
- Uh yeah, we took some
pre-law classes together,


1158
01:14:47.438 --> 01:14:49.146
but he was never like,
the top of the class,


1159
01:14:49.147 --> 01:14:51.937
if you know what I mean. It's
a classic case of nepotism.


1160
01:14:51.938 --> 01:14:54.604
- Okay, but Dan would have
been running around a lot


1161
01:14:54.605 --> 01:14:56.104
with Magnolia back then.

1162
01:14:56.105 --> 01:14:58.062
Are you sure that you never
crossed paths with her?


1163
01:14:58.063 --> 01:15:01.062
I
-I can't hear you.

1164
01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.812
Well, I was just,
or...


1165
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.062
This is Lucy Carver.

1166
01:15:07.063 --> 01:15:08.687
I assume
you've already heard


1167
01:15:08.688 --> 01:15:09.979
they've arrested Dan Brooksbank.

1168
01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:13.812
- Yeah, Zelda, hi.
Yes, I've heard.


1169
01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:16.021
- Oh, Zelda. Is that
Magnolia's mother?


1170
01:15:16.022 --> 01:15:18.021
- Yeah. Zelda, uh, one second,

1171
01:15:18.022 --> 01:15:19.605
I'm just gonna go
some place quieter.


1172
01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:22.897
- Um, Luce, wait!

1173
01:15:23.772 --> 01:15:26.812
- Go ahead, Zelda.
Has Dan confessed?


1174
01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:28.271
Not yet.

1175
01:15:28.272 --> 01:15:30.271
I can't believe I didn't
suspect him sooner.


1176
01:15:30.272 --> 01:15:32.729
I've known him almost
his entire life.


1177
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:33.937
- No one could tell.

1178
01:15:33.938 --> 01:15:36.105
That's what made
him so dangerous.


1179
01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:40.271
- Luce, that room actually
has really bad reception,


1180
01:15:40.272 --> 01:15:43.229
you should come back over here.
- No, no, it seems fine.


1181
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:45.062
I suppose it
doesn't matter now,


1182
01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:46.937
but I did manage to remember

1183
01:15:46.938 --> 01:15:49.896
what JD stood for in
Magnolia's diaries.


1184
01:15:49.897 --> 01:15:51.604
- Yeah, Joshua Daniel.

1185
01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:55.812
- It stood for James Dean,
which was a nickname,


1186
01:15:55.813 --> 01:15:57.937
of course. I seem to remember

1187
01:15:57.938 --> 01:16:00.062
that the young man in
question was always wearing


1188
01:16:00.063 --> 01:16:03.354
some gaudy red jacket,
just like the actor did


1189
01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:07.312
in that film, I don't
remember which one.


1190
01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:10.604
Anyway, I suppose I
had trouble remembering


1191
01:16:10.605 --> 01:16:13.937
because Magnolia referred
to him by a different name


1192
01:16:13.938 --> 01:16:17.397
when we talked. I...
- Zelda, what was his name?


1193
01:16:18.647 --> 01:16:20.062
- Jimmy.

1194
01:16:23.605 --> 01:16:25.062
Lucy?

1195
01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:26.812
Are you well?

1196
01:16:57.438 --> 01:16:58.812
- Everything okay?

1197
01:16:58.813 --> 01:17:01.729
- Yeah. Yeah, everything's okay.

1198
01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:04.104
Um, I'm just not
feeling very well.


1199
01:17:04.105 --> 01:17:06.272
So, I
-I think I'm gonna go home.

1200
01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:08.729
- You're not leaving
because of something


1201
01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.147
Zelda said, are you?

1202
01:17:10.897 --> 01:17:14.605
- No. No, she just
wanted to chat.


1203
01:17:15.855 --> 01:17:17.022
You know Zelda.

1204
01:17:18.772 --> 01:17:20.230
- Do I?

1205
01:17:24.563 --> 01:17:26.437
- If you had just
dropped the whole case,


1206
01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.729
like I told you!

1207
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.104
Dammit this stuff really hurts.

1208
01:17:34.105 --> 01:17:35.979
- Yeah, it's supposed to, sicko!

1209
01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.646
Just tell me everything!

1210
01:17:37.647 --> 01:17:39.937
- Or what, you're gonna kill me
with that stupid pepper-spray?


1211
01:17:49.938 --> 01:17:52.104
- Just tell me what
you did to her!


1212
01:17:55.188 --> 01:17:57.647
- Fine, I met Maggie in college.

1213
01:17:58.855 --> 01:18:00.896
- Okay. Go, talk!

1214
01:18:00.897 --> 01:18:03.854
- Oh! We were perfect
for each other.


1215
01:18:03.855 --> 01:18:07.854
We both hated all those rich,
entitled trust fund babies.


1216
01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:10.729
- What? Magnolia was
a trust fund baby!


1217
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:13.897
- She wasn't like that! Okay?!

1218
01:18:14.647 --> 01:18:17.896
You should have seen how hard
she worked every day of her life


1219
01:18:17.897 --> 01:18:19.396
to put a smile on her face

1220
01:18:19.397 --> 01:18:22.062
and all on her mom's
face, and every day!


1221
01:18:22.063 --> 01:18:24.229
And nobody saw it
but me. Nobody.


1222
01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:26.062
- Okay, so-so what did
you? You asked her out?


1223
01:18:26.063 --> 01:18:27.354
And she, and she
turned you down?


1224
01:18:27.355 --> 01:18:29.521
- She didn't know
what she wanted.


1225
01:18:29.522 --> 01:18:30.937
What don't you get?!

1226
01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:32.437
- So you stalked her, Roy?

1227
01:18:32.438 --> 01:18:34.562
What, you couldn't
just let it go?


1228
01:18:34.563 --> 01:18:37.187
Why didn't you just let it go?
- No, I tried to get over her


1229
01:18:37.188 --> 01:18:40.312
and it didn't work, so I...

1230
01:18:40.313 --> 01:18:42.563
Then I saw her at the
reunion and it was all...


1231
01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:44.854
- The college reunion.

1232
01:18:47.438 --> 01:18:49.271
She was there. 
She was there!

1233
01:18:49.272 --> 01:18:51.104
And that's where she
saw you, wasn't it?


1234
01:18:51.105 --> 01:18:52.646
- I saw her and she
looked right through me


1235
01:18:52.647 --> 01:18:54.937
like I was nothing, and
everything that we had


1236
01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:56.813
was nothing!

1237
01:18:57.438 --> 01:18:59.646
And I tried to get
it out of my system.


1238
01:18:59.647 --> 01:19:02.229
I even pitched that stupid,
little role-play game with you


1239
01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:03.812
and maybe it would've worked,

1240
01:19:03.813 --> 01:19:05.562
if you hadn't worn
that lipstick!


1241
01:19:05.563 --> 01:19:07.937
- Oh, my God! Get over
the lipstick, Roy!


1242
01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:10.230
- It was your fault!

1243
01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:14.646
When you weren't enough, I
went for what I deserved.


1244
01:19:14.647 --> 01:19:16.812
What me
and Maggie deserved.


1245
01:19:16.813 --> 01:19:18.271
So I made a plan.

1246
01:19:18.272 --> 01:19:20.312
It was easy to sneak in
and out of the office


1247
01:19:20.313 --> 01:19:22.312
on all those late nights,

1248
01:19:22.313 --> 01:19:24.937
and no one would think that
a man in his $3,000 suit...


1249
01:19:24.938 --> 01:19:26.437
- I can't...
- would ever crawl down


1250
01:19:26.438 --> 01:19:28.896
the fire escape.
- I can't breathe, Roy!


1251
01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:31.896
I don't care!

1252
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.687
- I was in and out
of her apartment


1253
01:19:33.688 --> 01:19:37.771
and back at the office before
everyone knew that I was gone.


1254
01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:40.396
And it was brilliant
and it would've worked


1255
01:19:40.397 --> 01:19:42.437
if it hadn't been for you!

1256
01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:46.772
- Did you kill her?

1257
01:19:47.272 --> 01:19:49.105
That's
between Maggie and me.


1258
01:19:55.938 --> 01:19:57.480
- Magnolia!!

1259
01:20:03.438 --> 01:20:04.688
Magnolia!

1260
01:20:04.772 --> 01:20:06.479
Magnolia!

1261
01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.771
She's here!

1262
01:20:11.605 --> 01:20:13.187
Magnolia? Oh, my God!

1263
01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:14.437
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1264
01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:16.146
Oh, my God.

1265
01:20:16.147 --> 01:20:17.688
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

1266
01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:21.479
Okay. Are you okay?

1267
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.437
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm
okay, please help me.


1268
01:20:23.438 --> 01:20:25.021
- Okay, okay.
- He... he came to my house.


1269
01:20:25.022 --> 01:20:27.396
- Shh, just be careful.
- Maggie, Maggie, I can explain.


1270
01:20:27.397 --> 01:20:29.062
This woman means nothing to me.

1271
01:20:29.063 --> 01:20:30.437
- Roy! Roy!
- Hey, hey, hey,


1272
01:20:30.438 --> 01:20:32.062
calm down. Your lipstick.

1273
01:20:32.063 --> 01:20:33.229
Don't, don't, don't.

1274
01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:35.146
Are you
kidding me right now?


1275
01:20:35.147 --> 01:20:38.229
- Please hurry, he's crazy.
- Shh! Shh! Shh...


1276
01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.771
- Roy, Roy.
- You will not ruin this for me!


1277
01:20:40.772 --> 01:20:42.937
Not when she's so
close to loving me!


1278
01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:45.271
- I am not!
- Roy, just get off her!


1279
01:20:45.272 --> 01:20:46.937
Get!

1280
01:20:46.938 --> 01:20:48.354
Stop fighting your restraints.

1281
01:20:48.355 --> 01:20:51.104
Your skin is so
delicate. Stop, stop.


1282
01:20:51.105 --> 01:20:52.937
- Stop! You are so pathetic.

1283
01:20:52.938 --> 01:20:55.437
- Shut up.
- What makes you think


1284
01:20:55.438 --> 01:20:58.187
that a woman like
Magnolia Maines


1285
01:20:58.188 --> 01:21:00.271
would ever love you?
- Shut up.


1286
01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.104
- Oh, my God, you
are nothing, Roy!


1287
01:21:02.105 --> 01:21:04.104
- Shut up!
- You're the nothing here.


1288
01:21:10.938 --> 01:21:12.438
- Okay, okay.

1289
01:21:14.772 --> 01:21:16.855
Okay...

1290
01:21:22.022 --> 01:21:23.605
Ah!

1291
01:21:27.147 --> 01:21:29.937
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1292
01:21:32.272 --> 01:21:33.896
- I loved you.

1293
01:21:33.897 --> 01:21:35.938
- Yeah? So what?

1294
01:21:37.188 --> 01:21:38.979
Come on.
- Okay.


1295
01:21:45.772 --> 01:21:47.271
Get back here!

1296
01:21:48.813 --> 01:21:49.979
Go, Magnolia!

1297
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:36.229
- EMTs are sending
a second ambulance


1298
01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:37.479
to take you both
to the hospital.


1299
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.437
Should be here in a few.

1300
01:22:39.438 --> 01:22:41.062
How are you holding up?

1301
01:22:41.063 --> 01:22:43.897
- I'm... I'm okay, yeah.

1302
01:22:45.605 --> 01:22:47.479
- All right, well,
I'm just gonna...


1303
01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.688
finish up around
here. I'll be back.


1304
01:22:51.272 --> 01:22:53.104
Lucy...
- Yeah, Detective,


1305
01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:55.563
I know that I
should've called you.


1306
01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.979
- We would've never
found her without you.


1307
01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.313
Good job.

1308
01:23:10.938 --> 01:23:12.522
- Hey.
- Hey.


1309
01:23:14.188 --> 01:23:15.354
Can I ask you something?

1310
01:23:15.355 --> 01:23:18.063
- Yeah. Yeah, of
course, anything.


1311
01:23:18.855 --> 01:23:19.980
- Who are you?

1312
01:23:21.605 --> 01:23:23.937
Yeah. Right.

1313
01:23:23.938 --> 01:23:28.604
Um... my name is Lucy,
and I'm a journalist.


1314
01:23:28.605 --> 01:23:30.104
I've been writing a story

1315
01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:32.855
about your disappearance,
or investigating.


1316
01:23:35.397 --> 01:23:37.605
- Yeah, I guess
I'm a good story.


1317
01:23:38.397 --> 01:23:40.397
- You're a great story.

1318
01:23:42.563 --> 01:23:44.396
Um...

1319
01:23:44.397 --> 01:23:46.022
Who noticed that I was gone?

1320
01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.146
- Your mom.

1321
01:23:49.147 --> 01:23:51.604
Sunday night, you missed a call.

1322
01:23:51.605 --> 01:23:53.438
- Sunday night, that fast?

1323
01:23:56.938 --> 01:23:59.187
He said no one was
looking for me.


1324
01:23:59.188 --> 01:24:00.771
- He lied.

1325
01:24:00.772 --> 01:24:03.479
People were looking for you.

1326
01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.354
People who love you.

1327
01:24:05.355 --> 01:24:06.979
They never lost hope.
They're the reason


1328
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.438
that I found you here, okay?

1329
01:24:12.938 --> 01:24:16.105
- I guess you're gonna wanna
interview me now, right?


1330
01:24:19.605 --> 01:24:22.480
- Why don't you just
think about it. But...


1331
01:24:26.647 --> 01:24:29.229
- I'll see her right now
unless you want a lawsuit.


1332
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.062
- Mom?
- Oh!


1333
01:24:45.688 --> 01:24:47.437
- The ambulance is ready for ya.

1334
01:24:47.438 --> 01:24:49.312
- Okay.

1335
01:24:49.313 --> 01:24:51.438
- You got anyone meeting
you at the hospital?


1336
01:24:52.022 --> 01:24:53.979
- Uh no. But that's okay.

1337
01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.688
I'm... I'm fine on my own.

1338
01:25:23.438 --> 01:25:25.271
Hi, Mom.

1339
01:25:25.272 --> 01:25:27.730
Uh... it's me.

1340
01:25:29.022 --> 01:25:30.230
Call me.

1341
01:25:35.188 --> 01:25:38.521
- Well... you look terrible.

1342
01:25:38.522 --> 01:25:40.229
- What are you doing?

1343
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:41.604
- Detective Webb called.

1344
01:25:41.605 --> 01:25:42.979
He thought someone should
be here to keep you


1345
01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.480
out of trouble while they
finish clearing everything up.


1346
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.688
Oh Lucy, I'm so
glad you're okay.


1347
01:25:53.313 --> 01:25:55.021
- Me too.

1348
01:25:55.022 --> 01:25:56.147
Thank you.

1349
01:25:57.647 --> 01:25:59.812
- Come on, I owe you
a slice of pizza.


1350
01:25:59.813 --> 01:26:01.937
- I think I'm supposed
to go to the hospital.


1351
01:26:01.938 --> 01:26:03.396
- They don't deliver
to hospital rooms?


1352
01:26:03.397 --> 01:26:05.688
We'll see about that. Let's go.

1353
01:26:12.813 --> 01:26:14.813
Lucy! Lucy, wait!

1354
01:26:15.272 --> 01:26:18.229
This is my phone number. It's
so we can do the interview.


1355
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:19.772
It's my way of saying thank you.

1356
01:26:20.397 --> 01:26:21.772
- Sounds good.

1357
01:26:30.897 --> 01:26:32.479
- You ready?

1358
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.605
- Yeah, let's go.

1359
01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:55.855
