00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:11.357
<i>- What happens if fiction
continues to be fiction?</i>


2
00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:12.528
Can you deal with that?

3
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:13.656
- I can't deal with that.

4
00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:15.127
I can't.
- No?


5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.169
How about things
that you know are fiction?


6
00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:21.104
What about things like
Cinderella or Snow White?


7
00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:23.937
- No, no. What I'm trying to say
is that, um, that, um,


8
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.037
can I fall in love
with my own imagination?


9
00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:30.172
- Well, we've gotta
be really careful


10
00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:33.047
when we deal with what's
real and what's fiction.


11
00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:35.280
- I don't-I don't even know
what's real or not.


12
00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:36.616
- I know.

13
00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:38.088
That's the problem.

14
00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:42.051
It's not very cold out.

15
00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:44.187
- It's not very cold out?
- Nope. Not too bad.

<i>And maybe I wrote it

51
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.707
<i>I think my mother imagined
that her first-born son</i>


52
00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:21.116
<i>would be part of
the real mainstream,</i>


53
00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:25.453
<i>the kind of kid
who was popular at school,</i>


54
00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:29.526
athletic, at ease in the world,

55
00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:32.593
and basically
quite conventional.


56
00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:35.394
And instead, she got me.

57
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:44.207
<i>When I was growing up,
I had a lot of weird hang-ups.</i>


58
00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.871
<i>I mean, I refused
to wear blue jeans.</i>


59
00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:51.241
<i>I refused to listen
to rock music of any kind.</i>


60
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:55.486
<i>I was obsessed
with Emily Dickinson's</i>


61
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.613
<i>poems of anguish,</i>

62
00:03:56.654 --> 00:03:59.214
<i>and told my friends
the plots of operas.</i>


63
00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:02.461
<i>I was a weirdo.</i>

64
00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.687
<i>And, you know, my parents
were really good.</i>


65
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.891
<i>My mom, in particular.</i>

66
00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:08.430
<i>She would sort of get on board</i>

67
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:11.334
<i>with the things
that interested me...</i>


68
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.138
<i>...even when they were
a little bit strange.</i>


69
00:04:16.374 --> 00:04:19.606
I feel like there was
a lot of leeway for me to be...


70
00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:22.307
...different in all
kinds of ways...


71
00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:27.447
<i>...but my parents really
didn't want to have a gay son...</i>


72
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.187
<i>...and I thought
if I tell them I'm gay,</i>


73
00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.919
<i>they're going to be
brutally disappointed.</i>


74
00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:37.253
<i>And I told them, and they were.</i>

75
00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:39.297
<i>It was a catastrophe.</i>

76
00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:42.561
<i>My mother sort of
lectured me about</i>


77
00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:45.433
<i>what a sad and lonely life
it would be,</i>


78
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.496
<i>and I mentioned
some gay family friends</i>


79
00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.235
<i>and I said that they'd
done all right,</i>


80
00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.401
<i>and my mother said,</i>

81
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:53.343
"If I had thought that
inviting them into our house


82
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.779
"was gonna make you think that
was an acceptable way of life,


83
00:04:56.848 --> 00:04:59.181
they would never
have crossed the threshold."


84
00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:04.945
<i>For many years after that,
I was...</i>


85
00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:08.284
<i>...angry,
I was ambivalent.</i>


86
00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:10.260
<i>I wanted to understand</i>

87
00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:12.923
<i>why my parents dealt with me
the way they did.</i>


88
00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:17.326
<i>I wanted to see how
other families managed it.</i>


89
00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.295
<i>I thought I don't wanna know
just about families</i>


90
00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:21.829
<i>of gay people.</i>

91
00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:24.968
<i>I wanted to look
as widely as I could.</i>


92
00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:27.576
I set out to write
Far From the Tree,


93
00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:29.705
which was my attempt
to investigate


94
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:30.976
how families go about

95
00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:33.845
dealing with children who
are very different from them.


96
00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:39.223
<i>I spent 10 years researching
and writing this book.</i>


97
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.282
<i>- We'll look at things
like dwarfism,</i>


98
00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:42.520
<i>an autistic child,</i>

99
00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:44.222
<i>a child who commits a crime.</i>

100
00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:46.821
It's a tough thing sometimes
for a parent to reconcile with.


101
00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:49.390
- There are some children
who were born with an identity


102
00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:51.561
or a way of being,
or a set of priorities


103
00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:54.435
<i>that are completely foreign
to his or her parents.</i>


104
00:05:55.273 --> 00:05:59.506
<i>The stories I heard felt
so alien at the beginning,</i>


105
00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:02.638
<i>but bit by bit, they came
to feel very real</i>


106
00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:04.774
<i>and very intimate to me.</i>

107
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:09.514
<i>And I realized that
in telling these stories,</i>


108
00:06:09.587 --> 00:06:13.524
I was investigating the very
nature of family itself.


109
00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:32.308
- You know what?

110
00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:34.676
This actually looks
very modernistic.


111
00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:37.272
This could be by Picasso.
- Yeah.


112
00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:38.748
- Doesn't that look very modern?

113
00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.447
And look at this.

114
00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:46.554
- Looks like
<i>Turn the World Around.</i>


115
00:06:46.624 --> 00:06:47.956
- Turn the-
- It looks like what?

116
00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:50.393
- Turn the World Around.
Like Harry Belafonte stuff.


117
00:06:50.428 --> 00:06:52.522
- Yes. Yes, indeed,
it does.


118
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.425
I think that's where
they got their inspiration


119
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.593
for those masks.

120
00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:57.931
- Yeah.

121
00:06:58.569 --> 00:06:59.935
- Ooh.

122
00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:04.469
- Ooh!

123
00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:10.038
Where is everybody?

124
00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.750
We are the last people
on the planet.


125
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:15.611
Hello!

126
00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:19.087
<i>When Jason was born,</i>

127
00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:20.586
<i>the doctor said,</i>

128
00:07:20.658 --> 00:07:22.718
"What we do
with children like this


129
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.698
is we send them away before
an attachment is formed."


130
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.697
I mean, this is so ludicrous

131
00:07:31.736 --> 00:07:34.069
that an obstetrician
doesn't understand


132
00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:37.070
that you have spent nine months
forming an attachment.


133
00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:38.906
What did they think this was?

134
00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:43.341
All right, my love.
I had a wonderful time.


135
00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:45.510
Be good.

136
00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:49.749
- Love you.
- Love you, honey.


137
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.948
Okay.
Talk to you soon.


138
00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:52.115
- Okay.

139
00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:05.830
Oops.

140
00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:09.601
- You got it?

141
00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:11.542
Come here.
Give it here.


142
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:13.571
Let me get you.

143
00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:17.972
Yeah?

144
00:08:18.015 --> 00:08:20.746
<i>
- I was born with Down Syndrome.</i>

145
00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:23.584
<i>This is what we called
"retarded."</i>


146
00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:27.591
We don't want to say that word
because it's banned from...


147
00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:29.786
...it was banned
from conversation.


148
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:35.762
Down syndrome is
a chromosomal mishap.


149
00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:37.995
It's-it's an extra chromosome.

150
00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:40.436
Never ever goes away.

151
00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:44.872
- Hi!

152
00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:48.578
<i>- The doctors told us,
"Your child is a Mongoloid.</i>


153
00:08:48.613 --> 00:08:50.605
<i>"He's not gonna walk.
He's not gonna talk.</i>


154
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:52.912
<i>He's not gonna read.
He's not gonna write."</i>


155
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.914
<i>And I was frightened.</i>

156
00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:03.628
<i>It was as if Jason
had this rubber stamp,</i>


157
00:09:03.694 --> 00:09:05.788
<i>this great black rubber stamp</i>

158
00:09:05.863 --> 00:09:09.527
<i>with the word "retarded"
over his forehead.</i>


159
00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:11.766
- Jason.
- Jason.


160
00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:14.415
- Jason, would you put your
hands on your head for Daddy?


161
00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:16.067
Yay!

162
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.475
<i>- But Charles and I decided
that you don't write off</i>


163
00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:23.879
a person because of a label
that he carries.


164
00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:26.650
<i>That Jason was a person
who could learn.</i>


165
00:09:26.717 --> 00:09:28.151
- Jason, what does that say?

166
00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:29.085
- Over.

167
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.952
- Okay.
What does this say?


168
00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:34.114
- Under.

169
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:35.887
- What does this say?

170
00:09:36.627 --> 00:09:37.560
- Across.

171
00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:38.835
- The point that I'm driving at

172
00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.092
is that when you walk
out of here today


173
00:09:41.165 --> 00:09:43.498
and somebody says to you,
"Retarded people,


174
00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:46.504
Down syndrome people,
they'll never learn to read,


175
00:09:46.571 --> 00:09:48.870
they'll sit against the wall
and just grow big."


176
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.499
and so forth and so on.

177
00:09:50.575 --> 00:09:52.476
And you could sort of
give the lie to it


178
00:09:52.543 --> 00:09:55.138
<i>and won't take the opportunity
at any time to...</i>


179
00:09:55.213 --> 00:09:56.613
<i>...come and talk to people.</i>

180
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:57.681
As you get to know them,

181
00:09:57.748 --> 00:09:59.979
you realize that friendship
and warmth


182
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:02.077
are things that they respond to.

183
00:10:03.154 --> 00:10:06.056
<i>- As Jason started
accomplishing things...</i>


184
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.134
- When you have four bagels

185
00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:08.786
and you take away one bagel...

186
00:10:08.826 --> 00:10:09.826
- Three.

187
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.489
<i>
- We were so excited.</i>

188
00:10:11.562 --> 00:10:13.155
<i>It was such a miracle.</i>

189
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:16.167
- Hey, you know what?
Can you count to 10 in Spanish?


190
00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:18.669
- Okay.

191
00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:20.103
<i>
- He walked, he talked,</i>

192
00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:21.571
<i>and he did all kinds of things</i>

193
00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:24.508
<i>that he was not supposed to do.</i>

194
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:27.034
- What does it mean
to be retarded?


195
00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:29.512
Do they think like we do?

196
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.515
Do they have the same feelings?

197
00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:32.845
And now I'd like you to meet

198
00:10:32.884 --> 00:10:35.615
Emily and Charles Kingsley,
Jason's parents.


199
00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:38.053
- He is now reading
on a second-grade level.


200
00:10:38.122 --> 00:10:40.682
The child they told us
to junk and throw away


201
00:10:40.758 --> 00:10:43.887
is doing second-grade reading,
first-grade math.


202
00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:46.624
<i>And he became a bit
of a celebrity.</i>


203
00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:48.256
<i>
- Meet Jason Kingsley.</i>

204
00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:51.560
<i>You might think Down syndrome
hardly gets in his way.</i>


205
00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:55.664
- I was studying sound,
electricity, and energy.


206
00:10:56.607 --> 00:10:58.872
- I literally thought,
"Well, this is a piece of cake.


207
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.812
"This is-this is really-
this is really thrilling,


208
00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:04.611
and they must have been
just plain wrong."


209
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:16.754
- Hi, Jason.
- Hi.


210
00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:27.595
<i>
- I worked here about 18 years.</i>

211
00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:31.240
<i>I deliver the mail
and deliver the packages.</i>


212
00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:36.207
<i>When I work here,</i>

213
00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:38.739
<i>I mostly work independently.</i>

214
00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:41.946
<i>It keeps me learning.</i>

215
00:11:42.353 --> 00:11:44.083
<i>It keeps me on my toes.</i>

216
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.351
<i>I think slowly,</i>

217
00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:50.585
but I'm smart in my own way.

218
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.799
<i>I'm mostly with emotions.</i>

219
00:11:56.968 --> 00:11:58.596
<i>I mean, sometimes I'm happy.</i>

220
00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:00.695
<i>Sometimes I'm a little bit sad.</i>

221
00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:02.740
- You have a great weekend,
okay?


222
00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:03.900
- Okay.
- See you next time.


223
00:12:03.975 --> 00:12:04.985
- See you next time.
- Take care.


224
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:06.307
- Bye.
- Bye.


225
00:12:08.112 --> 00:12:10.604
<i>Basically, I'm just
a normal guy.</i>


226
00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:13.683
- Here we go.

227
00:12:15.753 --> 00:12:17.722
<i>
- I live with Yaniv...</i>

228
00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:20.248
<i>...and Raymond.</i>

229
00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:30.926
<i>We are The Three Musketeers.</i>

230
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.733
And I like my life now

231
00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:37.672
until something better happens.

232
00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:40.675
- All right.

233
00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:46.707
- You guys good?
- Yeah, we're good.


234
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:51.416
Let's eat.

235
00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:55.058
<i>I do like Jason...</i>

236
00:12:55.993 --> 00:12:57.120
<i>...as a roommate,</i>

237
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:59.356
<i>As a friend and musketeer.</i>

238
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:03.291
But he doesn't know how to--
how to juggle between...


239
00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:05.199
...reality and fantasy.

240
00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.231
<i>
- I painted my room blue.</i>

241
00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:14.204
<i>I've got all blue clothes.</i>

242
00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:17.413
I have a costume.

243
00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:24.447
I wear this,
and I wear these pants...


244
00:13:25.923 --> 00:13:27.391
...and I wear this...

245
00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:35.699
...as Queen Elsa.

246
00:13:49.346 --> 00:13:50.691
<i>
- He's obsessed with</i> Frozen,

247
00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:52.946
and it gets me crazy
all the time.


248
00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:55.484
That's his personality.

249
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:00.085
<i>- ♪ Let them
in, don't let them see ♪</i>


250
00:14:00.157 --> 00:14:03.184
<i>♪ Be the good girl
you always have to be ♪</i>


251
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.751
<i>
- When I was a kid.</i>

252
00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:07.424
<i>The world revolved around me.</i>

253
00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.857
<i>And I was close-minded</i>

254
00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:13.336
until Elsa came and let it go.

255
00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:17.003
<i>- ♪ Let it
go, let it go ♪</i>

256
00:14:17.775 --> 00:14:19.505
<i>
- She opened my heart.</i>

257
00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:23.339
<i>- ♪ Let it
go, let it go ♪</i>

258
00:14:23.414 --> 00:14:25.747
<i>I want to go on a trip
to Norway.</i>


259
00:14:25.783 --> 00:14:27.809
<i>Because I know that she's there.</i>

260
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.790
And it feels like that
I fell in love with her.


261
00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:36.927
<i>- ♪ The cold
never bothered me anyway ♪</i>


262
00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:39.520
- "The cold never
bothered me anyway"


263
00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:46.960
That makes me feel happy.
That part.


264
00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:49.466
I always do that.

265
00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:53.976
<i>- It has sort
of taken over his life,</i>


266
00:14:54.044 --> 00:14:57.071
<i>and it's very difficult</i>

267
00:14:57.148 --> 00:15:00.812
to talk any kind of...

268
00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:03.821
...commonsense to him
about it.


269
00:15:06.056 --> 00:15:10.221
<i>But if it gives him
comfort and...</i>


270
00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:16.323
What are you gonna do?

271
00:15:17.868 --> 00:15:22.306
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

272
00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:26.970
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

273
00:15:27.044 --> 00:15:32.483
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Jason ♪</i>

274
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.488
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

275
00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:49.189
- More blue shirts.

276
00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:50.410
- This is because
you've been wearing


277
00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:51.925
your blue clothes a lot.

278
00:15:52.002 --> 00:15:54.164
So, I figured you could
use some fresh ones.


279
00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:58.840
- Um, um, I have
this stuff already.


280
00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:00.969
I've got already um,
um, blue clothes


281
00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:02.980
already color-coordinated.

282
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:09.086
- Yep.

283
00:16:11.622 --> 00:16:13.420
<i>It was letting go of a dream</i>

284
00:16:13.457 --> 00:16:16.894
<i>when I realized that Jason
was gonna be who he is.</i>


285
00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:23.895
<i>We worked so hard
and he worked so hard to...</i>


286
00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:26.938
<i>...develop so many skills.</i>

287
00:16:27.504 --> 00:16:31.168
- All for one, and one for all.

288
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:34.210
- All for one, and one for all.

289
00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:40.916
<i>- He was bright,
and he is bright.</i>


290
00:16:41.886 --> 00:16:45.618
<i>And I see him as
sort of falling into a lazy,</i>


291
00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:49.286
<i>unchallenging life mode
which could stay that way</i>


292
00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:51.295
<i>for years and years
and years and years.</i>


293
00:16:53.297 --> 00:16:55.129
<i>And that saddens me.</i>

294
00:16:56.967 --> 00:16:58.526
<i>But, you know, 
I have to realize</i>

295
00:16:58.602 --> 00:17:04.200
that I am dealing with a child
who has a disability.


296
00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:10.005
<i>There are certain limitations
that are just built in.</i>


297
00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:14.946
Somebody was asking me
today how you feel about


298
00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:17.284
the part of your life
when you were so famous,


299
00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:19.916
and you were going around
giving speeches


300
00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:21.323
and being a celebrity

301
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.690
as you were showing
so many people


302
00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:27.160
what a person with Down
syndrome was capable of


303
00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:29.257
and how much you could do.

304
00:17:32.102 --> 00:17:34.037
- I see things now
in a different angle,


305
00:17:34.104 --> 00:17:38.064
and I can't go back
to who I was.


306
00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:41.783
- Well, do you think that people
still look up to you now


307
00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:45.006
and still think that you
are somebody to admire?


308
00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:46.141
- No.

309
00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:07.061
<i>- It wasn't until
I tried to change who I was</i>


310
00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:10.505
<i>and tried as hard
as I possibly could</i>


311
00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:13.443
<i>that I realized that
who I was wasn't changeable.</i>


312
00:18:16.213 --> 00:18:18.409
<i>When I was growing up,
I'd always been told</i>


313
00:18:18.482 --> 00:18:21.179
<i>nothing matters
more than having a family,</i>


314
00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.018
<i>and my mother said to me,</i>

315
00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:26.284
<i>"You would be
a wonderful father,</i>


316
00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:28.189
and if you make this choice,

317
00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:30.456
you aren't going
to have a family,


318
00:18:30.494 --> 00:18:32.759
and I am not going
to have any grandchildren."


319
00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:40.603
<i>And of course, it was then
seen by lots of people</i>


320
00:18:40.671 --> 00:18:42.071
<i>as a choice.</i>

321
00:18:45.743 --> 00:18:48.235
<i>It wasn't just a different
way to be.</i>


322
00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:52.511
<i>It was understood to be a sin
and an illness.</i>


323
00:18:53.384 --> 00:18:58.379
<i>Something that was treatable,
and it was curable.</i>


324
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.518
<i>And I thought what I have to do</i>

325
00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.494
<i>is to get married
and have children.</i>


326
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.759
<i>And I thought to myself,
how can I get to the point</i>


327
00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:13.027
<i>at which I'm physically capable
of doing that.</i>


328
00:19:14.038 --> 00:19:18.339
<i>I said to myself,
"I need to change myself",</i>


329
00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:24.306
<i>and I can remember getting
copies of Playboy magazine</i>


330
00:19:24.381 --> 00:19:27.545
<i>and trying to sit with them
and stare at those women</i>


331
00:19:27.618 --> 00:19:31.077
<i>and trying to get myself
to be attracted to them.</i>


332
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:33.648
<i>And then I read an ad</i>

333
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.626
<i>for something called
sexual surrogacy therapy.</i>


334
00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:43.456
<i>And I went to this weird office
on 47th Street</i>


335
00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:47.171
and it was this set-up in which
there were these people


336
00:19:47.204 --> 00:19:49.696
who you were encouraged
to call, "doctors",


337
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.300
and they would sit and talk
to you for a little while,


338
00:19:52.342 --> 00:19:54.311
and then you went
into another room


339
00:19:54.344 --> 00:19:57.314
with these women you were
supposed to call, "surrogates",


340
00:19:57.347 --> 00:20:01.284
<i>and with whom you actually
went through sexual exercises.</i>


341
00:20:03.754 --> 00:20:06.155
<i>So, I went through
that therapy for months</i>


342
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.182
<i>with those surrogates.</i>

343
00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.523
<i>You know, it sort of worked</i>

344
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.426
because I had been terrified

345
00:20:11.462 --> 00:20:13.727
at the idea of having sex
with women,


346
00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:16.598
and after that,
I wasn't so terrified by it.


347
00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:21.238
<i>But, boy,
I was torturing myself.</i>


348
00:20:21.438 --> 00:20:23.430
<i>Taking myself down
to that office.</i>


349
00:20:23.507 --> 00:20:27.444
<i>The indignity of the exercises.</i>

350
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:29.878
All of that.
But most of all...


351
00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:33.784
...most of all,
it was that belief that...


352
00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:37.253
...it wasn't okay
to be who I was,


353
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.846
and that I had to torture myself

354
00:20:38.889 --> 00:20:42.223
to try to be someone else.

355
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:45.801
There's our doctor.

356
00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:52.169
Okay. Ready?
Gotta do more pushin'.


357
00:20:55.272 --> 00:20:56.535
- There's your man.

358
00:20:57.608 --> 00:20:58.608
Hello.

359
00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.303
- All the equipment
and everything.


360
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.641
He's got all the parts.

361
00:21:04.748 --> 00:21:06.182
Yeah.

362
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.481
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

363
00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:10.312
Hey, yellow hood.

364
00:21:10.354 --> 00:21:12.414
Hi, buddy boy.
- It's a duck.


365
00:21:12.723 --> 00:21:17.661
<i>- ♪ Happy
birthday, dear Jack ♪</i>


366
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.297
<i>
- Jack was just such a happy,</i>

367
00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:23.493
<i>crazy little guy</i>

368
00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:26.298
<i>for the first year and a half,
two years.</i>


369
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.838
Hey, big boy!

370
00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:30.431
<i>And to look at those videos now</i>

371
00:21:30.507 --> 00:21:32.169
<i>and to see that,</i>

372
00:21:32.242 --> 00:21:33.835
<i>and then go, "Wow, that's gone,</i>

373
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.641
that's never coming back."

374
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.648
It's hard.

375
00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:40.555
- Jack wants
to go for a wagon ride.


376
00:21:41.752 --> 00:21:44.347
Bye-bye!
Wave, Jackie!


377
00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:46.499
<i>I remember
we were outside one day,</i>


378
00:21:46.523 --> 00:21:49.254
<i>and this giant jumbo jet
flew overhead.</i>


379
00:21:49.326 --> 00:21:50.555
Jackie!

380
00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:52.323
<i>And I'm like,
"Jack, look at the plane."</i>


381
00:21:53.864 --> 00:21:54.888
<i>He didn't look.</i>

382
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:57.230
- Hey, Jackie, can you wave
bye-bye?


383
00:21:57.301 --> 00:21:59.236
No.
- He can say bye...


384
00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:01.738
<i>
- He wasn't using words.</i>

385
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:05.300
Jack.
Jackie!


386
00:22:06.877 --> 00:22:08.903
<i>You know, I thought maybe
it was a hearing thing.</i>


387
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:10.641
Good morning.
- Hey, Jackie.


388
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:12.479
Hi, Jackie.
Merry Christmas.


389
00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.747
<i>- And
finally, a psychologist came.</i>


390
00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:16.411
- Show me the chair.

391
00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:19.423
Touch your nose.

392
00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:23.517
<i>- That was in January.
And by July, we knew...</i>


393
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.399
<i>...he had autism.</i>

394
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:31.428
- Touch your shoulders.

395
00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:33.704
Touch your shoulders.

396
00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:37.283
- I watched him,
and, you know, they'd ask him


397
00:22:37.307 --> 00:22:40.334
to point at the yellow duck
and he couldn't do it.


398
00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:44.314
So I thought, "Wow, he...

399
00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:46.712
...he can't even point
to a picture."


400
00:22:49.253 --> 00:22:52.246
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

401
00:22:52.923 --> 00:22:56.519
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

402
00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:00.328
<i>- And because he never
spoke to us,</i>


403
00:23:00.397 --> 00:23:02.764
<i>I just assumed that
he was impaired...</i>


404
00:23:03.734 --> 00:23:05.566
<i>...and that he couldn't
understand us.</i>


405
00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:07.196
Give a kiss for Mommy.

406
00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:10.383
<i>- That he had
no idea what was going on.</i>


407
00:23:10.407 --> 00:23:12.342
You have to sit in your chair.

408
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.001
Don't tape this.

409
00:23:15.045 --> 00:23:16.045
Wave to Daddy.

410
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.407
- Hey, buddy.
- Wave.


411
00:23:17.481 --> 00:23:18.574
- Can you wave?
Maybe not.


412
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:20.379
<i>
- And I researched everything,</i>

413
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.282
<i>and we were of the mentality</i>

414
00:23:22.352 --> 00:23:23.752
we're going to do
everything we can.


415
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.584
So, we did.

416
00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:27.984
- Train coming.

417
00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:29.492
- Whoa!

418
00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:31.771
<i>- If there was
anything out there, we jumped on it.</i>


419
00:23:31.795 --> 00:23:32.990
- Robot!

420
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:35.796
Robot!

421
00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:36.925
<i>
- And we did music therapy</i>

422
00:23:36.967 --> 00:23:38.799
where they're playing Mozart

423
00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.667
and while they're doing
physical therapy.


424
00:23:42.472 --> 00:23:44.441
<i>
- We did allergy testing.</i>

425
00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:46.971
<i>Saw a naturopath.</i>

426
00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:49.410
<i>Chiropractor.</i>

427
00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:51.675
<i>He was eating a gluten-free,
dairy-free diet,</i>


428
00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:54.081
so I was having to shop
at specialty stores.


429
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.081
- And he had hyperbaric
oxygen therapy


430
00:23:56.353 --> 00:23:58.754
where you go and sit in

431
00:23:58.789 --> 00:24:00.815
a high-pressure
oxygen tank with a--


432
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.485
He's got like,
a spaceman hood on.


433
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.022
We were doing
homeopathy at the time


434
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:06.996
with a group out in Texas.

435
00:24:07.064 --> 00:24:08.508
- Of course, he wouldn't
take pills at that time,


436
00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:10.831
<i>so we had to put it in
this awful little slurry</i>


437
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:12.631
<i>and get it into him
and mix it with juice,</i>


438
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:14.831
and it was just real
time-consuming


439
00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:16.396
and horrifically expensive.

440
00:24:16.473 --> 00:24:18.374
- Here it is!
Who is it?


441
00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:21.378
<i>- And we
spent years on speech therapy.</i>


442
00:24:23.447 --> 00:24:25.109
<i>We thought that he should talk.</i>

443
00:24:26.483 --> 00:24:29.510
<i>We talk, so he needs
to learn how to talk.</i>


444
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.081
<i>But he was so angry
and so frustrated.</i>


445
00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:35.923
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

446
00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:41.360
<i>
- As he got older, it became</i>

447
00:24:41.431 --> 00:24:43.730
<i>scratching and pinching.</i>

448
00:24:44.368 --> 00:24:45.392
Have a seat.

449
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.136
<i>And he would routinely hit me.</i>

450
00:24:48.405 --> 00:24:50.567
And the more you touch
your nose...


451
00:24:52.576 --> 00:24:55.478
And I was angry with him
when he would attack us.


452
00:24:55.512 --> 00:24:57.606
It's hard not to take
it personally.


453
00:24:59.449 --> 00:25:01.042
Have a seat, Jack.

454
00:25:02.886 --> 00:25:04.582
<i>And I didn't know how
to help him.</i>


455
00:25:05.522 --> 00:25:07.855
<i>And I thought, "My God,
this is our life."</i>


456
00:25:11.762 --> 00:25:13.628
<i>I blamed it on everything.</i>

457
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:16.726
<i>I blamed it on
the medicine that I was on</i>


458
00:25:16.767 --> 00:25:17.530
when I was pregnant.

459
00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:19.160
I blamed it on the bed rest.

460
00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:22.069
I blamed it on my health,

461
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.145
like, maybe I wasn't as healthy
as I could have been


462
00:25:24.174 --> 00:25:25.972
when I was pregnant with him.

463
00:25:31.815 --> 00:25:34.080
I blamed myself for all of it.

464
00:25:36.486 --> 00:25:37.954
<i>Like I caused it.</i>

465
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:43.583
- The sun gives us heat.

466
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:47.997
H
-E
-A
-T, "heat."

467
00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:52.200
<i>- So, in
Austin, we walk into a room</i>


468
00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.028
<i>and this short little lady
walks in,</i>


469
00:25:54.104 --> 00:25:55.436
<i>and doesn't really talk to us,</i>

470
00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:57.083
<i>and then, she just started
talking to Jack.</i>


471
00:25:57.107 --> 00:25:58.803
- Heat.

472
00:25:58.942 --> 00:26:01.969
Or cold.
C-O-L-D, "cold."


473
00:26:03.079 --> 00:26:04.877
Heat or cold?

474
00:26:06.483 --> 00:26:07.576
Yes.

475
00:26:07.617 --> 00:26:08.915
Heat.

476
00:26:08.952 --> 00:26:11.547
The sun gives us heat.

477
00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:14.755
<i>
- And it was four days.</i>

478
00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:18.495
<i>She had a stack of paper
and a couple of pencils.</i>


479
00:26:18.562 --> 00:26:20.690
<i>And she had templates
with letters cut out,</i>


480
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.221
<i>and three of them,</i>

481
00:26:22.499 --> 00:26:25.560
<i>and she showed him
how to take the pencil</i>


482
00:26:25.602 --> 00:26:26.695
and point to the letter.

483
00:26:26.736 --> 00:26:28.967
So, she kind of walked him
through the first couple.


484
00:26:29.072 --> 00:26:30.802
- You're going to find it.

485
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:32.241
F
-A
-B
-C
-D
-E.

486
00:26:32.476 --> 00:26:34.945
<i>- And then she started asking
questions,</i>


487
00:26:34.978 --> 00:26:36.970
<i>and then she would answer.
She'd say the word.</i>


488
00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:37.946
<i>She'd write the word,</i>

489
00:26:37.981 --> 00:26:40.246
<i>and then she'd get
him to spell it.</i>


490
00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:42.844
We're thinking, okay,
this-this is... this is good.


491
00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:45.616
Almost a parlor trick,
but that's fine.


492
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.735
<i>- Then she started
to ask more abstract questions.</i>


493
00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:52.695
- This Thanksgiving.
Tell me anything about it.


494
00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:54.695
"J" to "O".

495
00:26:55.499 --> 00:26:57.798
<i>- It was a
very tedious, long process.</i>


496
00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:00.898
"M".

497
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.576
"A".
M-A-S-H.


498
00:27:06.977 --> 00:27:08.707
"Mash potatoes," yeah.

499
00:27:08.745 --> 00:27:11.738
What about the pumpkin pie?

500
00:27:12.249 --> 00:27:13.877
"N"

501
00:27:13.917 --> 00:27:15.579
You don't like the pumpkin pie?

502
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:17.247
You're not quite fond of it?
Okay.


503
00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:19.119
Enough with pumpkin pie.

504
00:27:20.657 --> 00:27:21.249
- We were off and running,

505
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:24.284
asking him all kinds of
questions about, you know.


506
00:27:24.528 --> 00:27:25.894
What-
- Do you like sports?

507
00:27:25.929 --> 00:27:27.727
What's your favorite sport?

508
00:27:27.764 --> 00:27:30.063
And he wanted a blue basketball.

509
00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:32.869
- Basketball would be
a very good idea.


510
00:27:32.903 --> 00:27:34.872
<i>
- Now she got our attention.</i>

511
00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:38.205
<i>Then she said, "Jack
just can't control his body,</i>


512
00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:39.766
<i>but you've got to keep going.</i>

513
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.612
<i>You have to just talk to him
and you've got to ignore this.</i>


514
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.842
This is him.
His body has taken over.


515
00:27:45.882 --> 00:27:47.544
You've just got to
work through it."


516
00:27:53.223 --> 00:27:54.567
<i>You know,
toward the end of the week,</i>


517
00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:56.219
<i>he was exhausted.</i>

518
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.220
<i>He was having a huge tantrum.
Huge.</i>


519
00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:05.144
<i>And she was saying,
"What's the matter, Jack?</i>


520
00:28:05.168 --> 00:28:07.137
<i>Let's talk about it.
What's the matter?"</i>


521
00:28:07.237 --> 00:28:08.865
- Now, you tell me.

522
00:28:09.172 --> 00:28:10.868
Any word.

523
00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:16.306
<i>- And through his
rage, he started spelling letters</i>


524
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.208
<i>with the stencils.</i>

525
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.727
<i>He typed out,</i>

526
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:41.363
"I am trying,
and I am really smart."


527
00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:50.647
<i>And then,
Jack was perfectly quiet.</i>


528
00:28:51.648 --> 00:28:55.085
<i>He was like,
"I finally got it out</i>


529
00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:56.983
<i>after all these years."</i>

530
00:28:57.721 --> 00:28:59.155
- And that was...

531
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.053
That was-that was the
moment where I just went,


532
00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:04.958
"My God, he's in there!"

533
00:29:07.697 --> 00:29:09.131
- I couldn't believe it.

534
00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:12.825
It was like I was meeting him
for the first time.


535
00:29:13.837 --> 00:29:15.032
Like...

536
00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:20.802
...my gosh,
you're real?


537
00:29:53.176 --> 00:29:55.536
<i>- I can hear
it better than lots of people.</i>


538
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:00.112
<i>But I am sensitive
to many noises</i>


539
00:30:00.183 --> 00:30:02.675
<i>that most people
can't really hear.</i>


540
00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:05.745
<i>It sounds like a crazy,
very loud combination</i>


541
00:30:05.822 --> 00:30:07.882
<i>of buzzing and voices.</i>

542
00:30:12.028 --> 00:30:13.690
- It's got a nice tone to it.

543
00:30:14.998 --> 00:30:16.990
Hey, that's a pretty
disappointing one.


544
00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:19.127
These plastic ones
aren't so good.


545
00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:20.830
They don't make much noise.

546
00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:25.035
<i>
- I am Jack Allnut.</i>

547
00:30:25.108 --> 00:30:26.474
<i>I am 13.</i>

548
00:30:28.878 --> 00:30:30.312
<i>I don't talk.</i>

549
00:30:31.715 --> 00:30:32.978
<i>I type.</i>

550
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:34.347
I...

551
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.218
...try...

552
00:30:40.123 --> 00:30:41.421
...to...

553
00:30:44.194 --> 00:30:45.492
...talk.

554
00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:53.468
I try to talk.

555
00:30:53.737 --> 00:30:55.797
I can't.
It is too hard.


556
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.784
- And I'm like,
what were you eating?


557
00:30:58.808 --> 00:31:00.834
What were you eating?
Repeat it.


558
00:31:03.747 --> 00:31:06.216
- I picked up Italian food.
I forgot the pizza.


559
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:08.080
I knew I was in trouble.
I turned around,


560
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:10.382
and I saw that light
go off behind me...


561
00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:18.085
<i>
- It's definitely easier for us...</i>

562
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:23.293
...but I'm not living
in his body.


563
00:31:23.366 --> 00:31:25.326
I don't go through what
he goes through every day.


564
00:31:26.169 --> 00:31:29.230
<i>He still will pinch and scratch
when he's frustrated.</i>


565
00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:32.070
- That's your water
right over there. See it?


566
00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:35.237
That's for you.
And you'll be able to get...


567
00:31:35.879 --> 00:31:37.939
Then you can tell me
what's bothering you.


568
00:31:38.948 --> 00:31:40.211
Can you sit down?

569
00:31:40.283 --> 00:31:42.514
<i>But I can communicate with him.</i>

570
00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:44.846
As a mom, that's all I needed.

571
00:31:45.522 --> 00:31:48.458
I just needed to know what's
going on inside your head.


572
00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:52.090
I... want...

573
00:31:52.962 --> 00:31:54.988
I want lots of cookies.

574
00:31:57.467 --> 00:31:58.799
- You had, like...

575
00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:01.804
- You had that huge rice bar.
- You had an Oreo and...


576
00:32:01.838 --> 00:32:03.015
- I know how that is.
You know what?


577
00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:05.531
I'll definitely let you
have one for dinner.


578
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:08.101
<i>- So, Jack, why do you
wear ear buds all the time?</i>


579
00:32:14.417 --> 00:32:16.352
They are noise-canceling.

580
00:32:17.453 --> 00:32:19.513
<i>- Can I ask you
another question, Jack?</i>


581
00:32:19.956 --> 00:32:22.118
- Can she ask you
another question, Jack?


582
00:32:22.992 --> 00:32:24.585
Yeah?

583
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.591
You've got to tell your story.

584
00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:30.032
Mh-

585
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.068
Can you do one more question?

586
00:32:34.337 --> 00:32:35.202
He said yes.

587
00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:36.262
<i>
- He said yes?</i>

588
00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:38.001
- Mh-
<i>- Okay.</i>


589
00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.839
<i>Um, can you describe
what it feels like</i>


590
00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:45.040
<i>for you to not be able to talk?</i>

591
00:32:52.956 --> 00:32:55.983
H
-E...

592
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:57.553
- Keep going.

593
00:32:59.596 --> 00:33:01.895
You're doing great.

594
00:33:01.998 --> 00:33:04.524
E
-E
-L.

595
00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:05.865
- You're doing great.
Awesome.


596
00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:10.632
I
-N
-G.

597
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:14.477
Feeling like...

598
00:33:14.544 --> 00:33:16.103
- The feeling is like...

599
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.514
A
-A
-T...

600
00:33:24.153 --> 00:33:25.280
- Mh-

601
00:33:25.955 --> 00:33:29.392
I
-G...

602
00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:30.888
- Keep going.
Great.


603
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.292
E.

604
00:33:33.963 --> 00:33:34.658
- Good.

605
00:33:34.898 --> 00:33:37.367
- R.
- Mh-Keep going.


606
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.198
Tiger.

607
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:48.500
I
-M
-A...

608
00:33:48.578 --> 00:33:50.308
- Great
- A...


609
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:53.309
A...

610
00:33:54.317 --> 00:33:56.684
C
-A...

611
00:33:56.953 --> 00:33:58.998
- Look-look right at that letter.
so you get it right.


612
00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:05.223
G
-E dot.

613
00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:10.963
The feeling is like
a tiger in a cage.


614
00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:31.217
- How's it going?
Hey, shut the gate.


615
00:34:34.057 --> 00:34:36.026
And you do the lock.

616
00:34:38.094 --> 00:34:39.494
Tell me about your day.

617
00:34:49.005 --> 00:34:50.049
All right, guys, listen.

618
00:34:50.073 --> 00:34:51.513
Let's talk about football
real quick.


619
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:52.509
Share the ball today.

620
00:34:52.542 --> 00:34:54.408
Make sure everybody's
getting passes.


621
00:34:54.444 --> 00:34:56.072
Know who your center is.

622
00:34:56.145 --> 00:34:57.636
Know who your quarterback is.

623
00:34:57.714 --> 00:35:00.274
You're going down and out
towards the out-of-bounds line.


624
00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:01.983
<i>That's a good pattern.</i>

625
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320
Come on, man.

626
00:35:07.457 --> 00:35:09.426
<i>On a day-to-day basis,
I'm his facilitator.</i>


627
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.689
Keep-keep working.
Keep working.


628
00:35:16.566 --> 00:35:17.295
Okay.

629
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:19.029
<i>So, I just help him type</i>

630
00:35:19.102 --> 00:35:21.765
and help him with anything else
he needs throughout the day.


631
00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:35.552
<i>
- Boys in my school,</i>

632
00:35:36.019 --> 00:35:37.681
<i>they say mean things.</i>

633
00:35:40.123 --> 00:35:41.284
<i>
- Do you think he knows?</i>

634
00:35:41.357 --> 00:35:43.223
<i>- Does he know what?
- That their filming him.</i>


635
00:35:43.259 --> 00:35:45.251
<i>- Yeah, he knows they're
filming him.</i>


636
00:35:45.728 --> 00:35:47.008
<i>Does he know they're
filming him?</i>


637
00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:50.158
<i>You've seen him talk.
He types.</i>


638
00:35:50.233 --> 00:35:51.531
<i>Why would he not know?</i>

639
00:35:52.035 --> 00:35:53.503
<i>- 'Cause he's autistic.</i>

640
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.036
<i>- He knows everything
that y'all know.</i>


641
00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:57.349
<i>Did y'all get straight A's
last semester?</i>


642
00:35:57.373 --> 00:35:59.274
<i>- I got 2 B's.
- He got straight A's.</i>


643
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.597
<i>- For a long time,
I'd thought that being gay</i>


644
00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:27.159
<i>was something you could
make the best of,</i>


645
00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:29.603
<i>but that gay relationships
were in some basic way</i>


646
00:36:29.672 --> 00:36:32.608
<i>lesser than straight
relationships.</i>


647
00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:39.708
I had realized that I couldn't
fix the fact that I was gay,


648
00:36:39.782 --> 00:36:41.375
but I still regretted it.

649
00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:46.722
<i>And there was a piece of me
that felt broken,</i>


650
00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:49.691
<i>and the idea that you could
accept or even celebrate</i>


651
00:36:49.759 --> 00:36:51.785
<i>the forms of your brokenness</i>

652
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:54.524
<i>didn't come to me
until a great deal later</i>


653
00:36:54.597 --> 00:36:56.589
<i>when the world around
me changed.</i>


654
00:36:56.666 --> 00:36:58.100
Gay rights!

655
00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:01.262
- Two, four, six, eight,
God does not discriminate!


656
00:37:02.772 --> 00:37:04.638
<i>
- The shift that has taken place</i>

657
00:37:04.707 --> 00:37:07.575
<i>over the course of
the last 40 years or so</i>


658
00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:11.603
<i>has been of a scale
that is almost unimaginable.</i>


659
00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:15.882
<i>And I became fascinated
by the process</i>


660
00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:18.213
<i>through which that happened.</i>

661
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:25.328
How did we get
from there to here,


662
00:37:25.394 --> 00:37:29.297
and how did something that was
understood to be an illness


663
00:37:29.365 --> 00:37:32.199
come, instead,
to be an identity?


664
00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:35.464
And that was what drove
my investigation.


665
00:37:36.806 --> 00:37:39.469
<i>And having lived to see
my supposed defect</i>


666
00:37:39.542 --> 00:37:41.670
come to be celebrated.

667
00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:44.578
I wondered whether
defectiveness itself


668
00:37:44.647 --> 00:37:47.515
might be all a matter
of perspective,


669
00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:51.611
and if it's possible for the
illness of homosexuality


670
00:37:51.687 --> 00:37:54.680
to turn into the identity
of gayness,


671
00:37:54.757 --> 00:37:56.191
<i>and what other instances</i>

672
00:37:56.259 --> 00:37:59.161
might the world's
point of view change?


673
00:37:59.662 --> 00:38:01.824
How do we decide

674
00:38:01.898 --> 00:38:05.630
what to cure
and what to celebrate?


675
00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:21.310
- Hey, I know you!
You're on TV!


676
00:38:22.618 --> 00:38:23.813
Big fan, big fan!

677
00:38:23.853 --> 00:38:25.481
I am, too!

678
00:38:27.757 --> 00:38:29.726
<i>
- I'm 23.</i>

679
00:38:31.227 --> 00:38:34.664
<i>But I guess, in a way,
I don't feel like an adult.</i>


680
00:38:38.301 --> 00:38:41.965
<i>My brother and sister,
they're very protective,</i>


681
00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:46.505
<i>but they don't know
what it's like to be me.</i>


682
00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:49.538
They don't really
quite understand


683
00:38:49.612 --> 00:38:52.275
as much as they think they do.

684
00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:08.526
<i>
- I come home every day at lunch</i>

685
00:39:08.564 --> 00:39:10.624
just to check up on her,

686
00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:13.534
um, because I know
that she gets bored.


687
00:39:14.904 --> 00:39:17.931
<i>She gets depressed sometimes.</i>

688
00:39:21.844 --> 00:39:23.710
<i>She wants to go to work.</i>

689
00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:25.509
<i>She wants to drive a car,</i>

690
00:39:25.581 --> 00:39:28.278
<i>but I can't afford
a special car for her.</i>


691
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.956
<i>- I would like to, you know,
go out more...</i>


692
00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:40.527
<i>...travel maybe.</i>

693
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.326
<i>You know, maybe someday
have a boyfriend.</i>


694
00:39:45.334 --> 00:39:46.962
<i>Never dated.</i>

695
00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.799
Nope.

696
00:39:49.505 --> 00:39:51.030
Still single.

697
00:39:54.443 --> 00:39:56.255
<i>
- So, do you want any make-up?</i>

698
00:39:56.279 --> 00:39:57.804
Make you look like...

699
00:39:57.847 --> 00:39:59.281
- I'm fine.

700
00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:01.048
- Don't be mean.

701
00:40:01.317 --> 00:40:02.683
What pants are you wearing?

702
00:40:05.988 --> 00:40:07.286
All right.

703
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.486
They're clean?
- Yes, Mom.


704
00:40:09.558 --> 00:40:12.687
You're smelling my pants.
That's gross!


705
00:40:13.396 --> 00:40:15.558
- Just checking to make sure.
- They're clean.


706
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:17.759
- Okay.
Iron your hair?


707
00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:19.731
- No, I'm not ironing my hair.

708
00:40:19.802 --> 00:40:21.293
- Curling?
- No.


709
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.497
- You want me to curl it?

710
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:23.903
- No.

711
00:40:23.973 --> 00:40:25.305
- I can curl it.

712
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:27.776
You'll have curls.
- I don't want to.


713
00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.646
- This is a lot of work.

714
00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:41.450
- That's why I said, "no",
but you didn't listen.


715
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.894
<i>Growing up...</i>

716
00:40:45.928 --> 00:40:49.990
<i>...I never really knew
that people like me</i>


717
00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:51.694
<i>existed in the world.</i>

718
00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:53.760
<i>I saw them on TV,</i>

719
00:40:53.803 --> 00:40:57.763
<i>but I've never met any
up close or in person.</i>


720
00:40:59.575 --> 00:41:02.374
<i>So, I'm curious...</i>

721
00:41:03.346 --> 00:41:04.974
Wondering...

722
00:41:06.515 --> 00:41:11.385
...is there anybody out there
like me?


723
00:41:55.998 --> 00:41:57.967
- Hi.
- Hi.


724
00:42:47.183 --> 00:42:48.481
- Hi.
We're here to register.


725
00:42:48.551 --> 00:42:50.110
Register? All right.

726
00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:52.018
- It is your first time.
Awesome.


727
00:42:52.087 --> 00:42:53.521
That's exciting.

728
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:55.753
Let's see
what you signed up for.


729
00:42:56.759 --> 00:42:59.490
Small tee shirt, a group photo,

730
00:42:59.528 --> 00:43:01.087
and two trivia night tickets.

731
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.190
And are you entering
the fashion show?


732
00:43:03.466 --> 00:43:04.466
- No.

733
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.196
- You should.
It's so much fun.


734
00:43:06.469 --> 00:43:08.013
It'll be a great way
to meet other people


735
00:43:08.037 --> 00:43:09.596
around your age, too.

736
00:43:13.075 --> 00:43:15.435
<i>- Who's
excited for a great show tonight?</i>


737
00:43:17.046 --> 00:43:19.481
<i>Miss Stephanie Brandon.</i>

738
00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:21.549
<i>Jasmine!</i>

739
00:43:25.488 --> 00:43:28.048
<i>Next we have Michelle Crowe.</i>

740
00:43:32.127 --> 00:43:34.187
<i>And now we have Christian!</i>

741
00:43:36.565 --> 00:43:39.125
<i>Next we have Loini and Maddie!</i>

742
00:43:52.982 --> 00:43:55.508
- All right, girls, high five!

743
00:43:55.584 --> 00:43:57.212
Whoa, missed that five!

744
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.012
Got mine!
You guys did it!


745
00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:01.990
You guys look great!

746
00:44:02.057 --> 00:44:03.057
You're so awesome.

747
00:44:03.125 --> 00:44:05.526
<i>
- I met my friend Mads...</i>

748
00:44:06.762 --> 00:44:09.755
<i>...and she's my age,
a little bit younger,</i>


749
00:44:09.832 --> 00:44:13.599
<i>but she's in the same
boat as I am.</i>


750
00:44:13.669 --> 00:44:14.669
- My gosh!

751
00:44:14.703 --> 00:44:16.865
- I'm a
-I'm usually a three.

752
00:44:18.574 --> 00:44:21.134
- I have toe rings
and they fit perfectly.


753
00:44:23.145 --> 00:44:26.638
<i>- It was wonderful
finding someone who's like you.</i>


754
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.776
It's awesome.

755
00:44:29.852 --> 00:44:33.880
I found my first friend
who could understand me.


756
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.949
So...

757
00:44:35.991 --> 00:44:37.550
...it felt great.

758
00:44:43.832 --> 00:44:45.767
- There is no
tiredness right now.


759
00:44:55.644 --> 00:44:57.078
<i>
- If you're a dwarf,</i>

760
00:44:57.146 --> 00:44:58.705
<i>it doesn't matter what you do.</i>

761
00:44:58.781 --> 00:45:00.340
<i>Everybody is probing you.</i>

762
00:45:00.616 --> 00:45:02.585
<i>Everybody is looking at you,</i>

763
00:45:02.618 --> 00:45:04.348
<i>making a judgment about you.</i>

764
00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:08.217
Oscar Wilde said
a person's real life


765
00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.987
is often the life
he cannot lead,


766
00:45:12.094 --> 00:45:14.222
and I think when you come
to a place like this


767
00:45:14.263 --> 00:45:16.596
for little people,
you get to lead the life


768
00:45:16.632 --> 00:45:17.895
you were born to lead.

769
00:45:17.967 --> 00:45:19.959
You don't necessarily
get to lead that life


770
00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:22.631
once you step away
from these walls.


771
00:45:28.677 --> 00:45:31.169
<i>I think people come to these
meetings to be validated.</i>


772
00:45:34.683 --> 00:45:36.127
<i>I think people come
to these meetings to be heard.</i>


773
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:38.086
<i>I think they come to be seen.</i>

774
00:45:39.822 --> 00:45:42.758
<i>And then I think they come
to disappear.</i>


775
00:46:21.363 --> 00:46:23.730
- ...To make the
message broader


776
00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:25.859
and more complete...

777
00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:33.969
- We want to talk about
next steps going forward,


778
00:46:34.043 --> 00:46:35.409
and what they want from us

779
00:46:35.444 --> 00:46:38.004
is for us to be comfortable
with what they're doing,


780
00:46:38.047 --> 00:46:40.107
and specifically,
these drug treatments


781
00:46:40.149 --> 00:46:43.347
for people with achondroplasia.

782
00:46:43.385 --> 00:46:45.752
And that really kind of
sent this message


783
00:46:45.821 --> 00:46:47.949
that created this
visceral reaction


784
00:46:48.023 --> 00:46:50.254
within some of our membership.

785
00:46:50.726 --> 00:46:53.457
- We are the only ones that can
advocate for ourselves


786
00:46:53.729 --> 00:46:55.960
and let people know

787
00:46:56.031 --> 00:46:59.991
that difference in the
genetic world is valuable,


788
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:03.403
and we have built
a community that thrives,


789
00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:07.877
and saying we know how
you want to perceive us,


790
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.812
but we want you to know

791
00:47:10.846 --> 00:47:12.314
there's this other alternative.

792
00:47:12.347 --> 00:47:16.409
<i>I think this drug is going to
profoundly change things,</i>


793
00:47:16.785 --> 00:47:18.344
<i>and it was kind of
an idyllic world.</i>


794
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.720
And we just had dwarf pride
that we were trying to manifest,


795
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.383
and we finally got there.

796
00:47:23.459 --> 00:47:24.825
Like, we got pretty close.

797
00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.488
Like, where we really felt
as a community


798
00:47:26.729 --> 00:47:28.027
pretty good about ourselves,

799
00:47:28.097 --> 00:47:29.097
and then this comes up

800
00:47:29.131 --> 00:47:31.930
and just throws
everything on its ear,


801
00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:34.869
and it's a--
it's a brave new world.


802
00:47:35.003 --> 00:47:38.201
- I feel like they present
something to the media


803
00:47:38.273 --> 00:47:40.003
and then we might say
what we say


804
00:47:40.042 --> 00:47:42.204
and then it's like,
"İsn't that sweet?"


805
00:47:42.244 --> 00:47:45.737
Personally,
I'm very against the idea


806
00:47:45.814 --> 00:47:48.283
that someone is researching

807
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.751
to find a cure
for my type of dwarfism.


808
00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:52.344
- ...is that it's all about...

809
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:56.051
<i>- It's the same message,
every day our whole lives</i>


810
00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:57.855
<i>that there's something
wrong with you</i>


811
00:47:57.926 --> 00:47:59.485
<i>and we need to fix it.</i>

812
00:47:59.995 --> 00:48:02.396
I don't think I need
to be fixed.


813
00:48:04.767 --> 00:48:06.497
Watch this.
Watch, watch.


814
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.236
Bah!

815
00:48:10.806 --> 00:48:12.104
Hi.

816
00:48:12.975 --> 00:48:14.204
How was your meeting?

817
00:48:14.276 --> 00:48:15.904
- Good.
- That's good.


818
00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:17.207
Hey.
- Hi, there.


819
00:48:17.279 --> 00:48:18.508
- How's it goin'?
- Good.


820
00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:20.258
- You got your new shirt.
- I'm wearin' my new shirt.


821
00:48:20.282 --> 00:48:21.841
Figured I'd get away with it.

822
00:48:21.917 --> 00:48:23.317
Tyrion Lannister, right?

823
00:48:23.385 --> 00:48:26.219
<i>- Joe and I met back
in the days of MySpace.</i>


824
00:48:26.288 --> 00:48:29.258
<i>I had seen his MySpace page,</i>

825
00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:31.555
<i>and I read everything
he wrote on there,</i>


826
00:48:31.827 --> 00:48:33.523
and he didn't just write
"My name's Joe."


827
00:48:33.796 --> 00:48:36.789
He wrote, like,
his entire political beliefs


828
00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:39.232
about every topic
that you can imagine.


829
00:48:39.301 --> 00:48:41.065
<i>So, I'm reading it one night
and I was like,</i>


830
00:48:41.103 --> 00:48:44.471
<i>"Holy smokes,
this guy is fascinating",</i>


831
00:48:44.506 --> 00:48:46.134
<i>and I made, like,
this mental note,</i>


832
00:48:46.208 --> 00:48:47.232
<i>I'm gonna meet him.</i>

833
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:48.386
<i>Like, that was all
there was to it.</i>


834
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:50.242
<i>I want to meet this guy.</i>

835
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:56.042
<i>So, I knew I was interested
in him immediately.</i>


836
00:48:58.887 --> 00:49:01.186
<i>And then,
kind of took us a while.</i>


837
00:49:01.256 --> 00:49:03.589
<i>It took us two years
before we got serious.</i>


838
00:49:03.859 --> 00:49:05.327
- Where's the light?

839
00:49:07.029 --> 00:49:08.190
Ha!

840
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.164
<i>- We dated for four
years, and then we got married.</i>


841
00:49:15.237 --> 00:49:17.297
- No? Okay.
No hat?


842
00:49:17.372 --> 00:49:19.466
- You should take your hat off for tonight.
- Okay.


843
00:49:44.867 --> 00:49:46.907
<i>- ...Perhaps
a shower or thunderstorm.</i>


844
00:49:46.935 --> 00:49:48.494
<i>High of 87 degrees.</i>

845
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.334
<i>Thursday will be very steamy.</i>

846
00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:53.034
<i>A high of 92 and partly sunny,</i>

847
00:49:53.108 --> 00:49:55.543
<i>but also some scattered
showers and thunderstorms...</i>


848
00:49:58.947 --> 00:50:01.917
<i>- I had dated some
average-height people</i>


849
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.977
<i>and tried to stay
open-minded about it,</i>


850
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.649
<i>but I just found
that they didn't get me,</i>


851
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.052
<i>and I don't know that there's
anyone that gets me</i>


852
00:50:10.092 --> 00:50:11.890
<i>the way he does.</i>

853
00:50:14.062 --> 00:50:15.428
<i>I love his dwarfism.</i>

854
00:50:15.464 --> 00:50:18.901
<i>That's something that we say,
like, "I liked your ism."</i>


855
00:50:20.102 --> 00:50:21.627
- Coffee improves
my quality of life.


856
00:50:21.904 --> 00:50:23.133
- Yeah.

857
00:50:23.205 --> 00:50:25.245
<i>You know, there are certain
characteristics involved</i>


858
00:50:25.307 --> 00:50:27.276
<i>with every type of dwarfism,</i>

859
00:50:27.342 --> 00:50:31.177
<i>and for achondroplasia,
it's having bigger hips.</i>


860
00:50:31.246 --> 00:50:35.911
And so Joe will walk up to me
in a public space


861
00:50:35.984 --> 00:50:37.953
and whisper in my ear,
"I liked your ism,"


862
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.114
meaning he likes my ass.

863
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:44.590
<i>- I like big butts
and I cannot lie.</i>


864
00:50:50.599 --> 00:50:53.125
<i>- I think there is
this cultural understanding</i>


865
00:50:53.201 --> 00:50:55.568
<i>that when you see
people like me,</i>


866
00:50:55.637 --> 00:50:59.005
<i>the core of the experience
is negative.</i>


867
00:51:00.542 --> 00:51:04.707
<i>And when people have
very low expectations, it's--</i>


868
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.280
It's surprising to them
when I indicate somehow


869
00:51:08.317 --> 00:51:10.343
that I'm not suffering.

870
00:51:13.588 --> 00:51:16.023
And here is the dwarf
in his natural habitat.


871
00:51:17.693 --> 00:51:19.127
He is taking his afternoon meal.

872
00:51:31.206 --> 00:51:32.139
Hi, Gram!

873
00:51:32.207 --> 00:51:33.641
How's everything?

874
00:51:34.376 --> 00:51:35.503
- I'm fine.
How are you?


875
00:51:35.577 --> 00:51:36.272
- I'm all right.

876
00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:37.345
You look good, Gram.

877
00:51:37.379 --> 00:51:39.007
- You look great yourself.

878
00:51:39.047 --> 00:51:40.047
- Thank you.

879
00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:44.652
- If I didn't know better,

880
00:51:44.686 --> 00:51:46.348
I'd think you were
up to no good.


881
00:51:46.722 --> 00:51:48.714
You've been practicing.
You have, haven't you?


882
00:51:48.991 --> 00:51:50.687
I have not!

883
00:51:53.095 --> 00:51:55.326
- Are you making presentations?

884
00:51:56.365 --> 00:51:59.767
- In Houston,
it's gonna be on disability,


885
00:52:00.035 --> 00:52:03.335
environmentalism, and gender.

886
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:06.720
- Well, that's
the newest thing now, right?


887
00:52:07.042 --> 00:52:09.153
- I don't think gender is new.
It's been around a while.


888
00:52:09.177 --> 00:52:11.703
- That's not what
she's talking about, Joseph.


889
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:15.045
- Don't they-
- Isn't that--

890
00:52:15.083 --> 00:52:16.227
- You talking about transgender?

891
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:18.049
- Yeah.
- That's--Well--


892
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.486
- That's not the same?

893
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:21.546
- Gender is just
gender in general, right?


894
00:52:21.623 --> 00:52:23.558
Transgender is one
variation on that.


895
00:52:23.592 --> 00:52:25.493
<i>
- We're very proud of him.</i>

896
00:52:25.527 --> 00:52:30.659
<i>I mean, he's got a nice job,
a nice wife, and his Phd.</i>


897
00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:32.065
- Don't even ask me
what he teaches


898
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.228
because it's over my head.

899
00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:36.631
But what does he teach?

900
00:52:37.039 --> 00:52:38.268
- Philosophy of some sort.

901
00:52:42.077 --> 00:52:44.069
- "Most people seem
to take it for granted


902
00:52:44.112 --> 00:52:46.047
"that disability is a bad thing,

903
00:52:46.114 --> 00:52:49.141
"and it's openly endorsed
by many philosophers,


904
00:52:49.184 --> 00:52:51.483
"bioethicists,
and public intellectuals


905
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.250
"who favor the reduction
or elimination


906
00:52:53.288 --> 00:52:55.621
of disability
from human experience."


907
00:52:56.525 --> 00:52:59.085
"These differences,
if visible or known,


908
00:52:59.127 --> 00:53:01.824
"will often play a subtle
or not-so-subtle role


909
00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:03.293
<i>"in shaping the character</i>

910
00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:06.301
<i>of one's interactions
with others."</i>


911
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.542
<i>
- So, um,</i>

912
00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:20.674
I understand
that you are interested


913
00:53:20.715 --> 00:53:22.650
in achieving a pregnancy.

914
00:53:22.684 --> 00:53:24.175
- Yes! Sounds good to me.
- Okay!


915
00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:28.782
- First, I want you
to tell me...


916
00:53:28.824 --> 00:53:30.156
how old are you?

917
00:53:30.192 --> 00:53:31.626
- 34.
- 34.


918
00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.323
- Do you smoke?

919
00:53:34.362 --> 00:53:34.852
- No.

920
00:53:35.097 --> 00:53:36.224
- Drink?
- No.


921
00:53:36.298 --> 00:53:39.166
- And how many times
have you been pregnant?


922
00:53:39.234 --> 00:53:40.167
- Once.

923
00:53:40.235 --> 00:53:42.830
- Okay. Tell me about
that last pregnancy.


924
00:53:43.105 --> 00:53:45.438
- It was a year ago
almost exactly.


925
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:48.839
We miscarried at seven weeks.

926
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.578
- Okay.

927
00:53:49.611 --> 00:53:51.876
So, was there an
ultrasound done?


928
00:53:52.114 --> 00:53:53.548
- They diagnosed the miscarriage

929
00:53:53.582 --> 00:53:55.608
with an ultrasound.
Yeah.


930
00:53:57.652 --> 00:53:58.676
Okay.

931
00:53:59.387 --> 00:54:00.731
An ultrasound is what
you need done between


932
00:54:00.755 --> 00:54:03.122
11 and 14 weeks.

933
00:54:03.258 --> 00:54:07.889
That's where we offer
every pregnant patient


934
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.565
a risk assessment for
genetic abnormalities.


935
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.468
<i>- You know, whether
or not the baby will be born</i>


936
00:54:14.503 --> 00:54:17.200
with a disability,
it is-- yeah, yeah.


937
00:54:17.239 --> 00:54:20.403
Of course it's something
we've thought about somewhat.


938
00:54:20.475 --> 00:54:22.535
- We can arrange for
a specific counseling


939
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:24.512
from the genetic standpoint.

940
00:54:24.546 --> 00:54:25.823
<i>- It's certainly
something that the doctors</i>


941
00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:27.645
<i>talk about a lot, right.</i>

942
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:31.284
- IVF and PGD,
those are certainly


943
00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:33.447
some options to test the embryo.

944
00:54:33.488 --> 00:54:36.925
<i>- You know, I think they
see normality as the end goal</i>


945
00:54:37.159 --> 00:54:41.255
and just sort of assuming that,

946
00:54:41.296 --> 00:54:46.257
normality is what any parent
would want for their child.


947
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:56.938
<i>
- I really want a child.</i>

948
00:54:57.179 --> 00:55:00.343
<i>I would say that it's probably
like the most basic</i>


949
00:55:00.382 --> 00:55:02.851
evolutionary like,
thing I've ever felt


950
00:55:02.884 --> 00:55:05.353
of I just want a kid!

951
00:55:10.325 --> 00:55:13.386
<i>I think that every parent
has a desire</i>


952
00:55:13.428 --> 00:55:15.488
<i>for their ideal child.</i>

953
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:18.960
<i>You know, like some people
think, "I really want a girl."</i>


954
00:55:19.201 --> 00:55:21.363
<i>But if they have a boy,
it's not the end of the world.</i>


955
00:55:25.307 --> 00:55:28.300
<i>So, I have a desire
to have a little person,</i>


956
00:55:29.211 --> 00:55:31.737
<i>but if we had
an average-sized child,</i>


957
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.806
I think I will still get it
on a level


958
00:55:33.848 --> 00:55:35.660
because I understand
what it's like to be different


959
00:55:35.684 --> 00:55:37.482
than your family.

960
00:55:48.363 --> 00:55:50.855
- No leaves on the trees yet.
- Not yet.


961
00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:53.232
- In a couple of weeks,
they'll be there.


962
00:55:55.237 --> 00:55:56.967
This is the forest primeval.

963
00:55:57.239 --> 00:56:00.539
- I'm not sure this is
quite the forest primeval.


964
00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:03.579
I think there's been a lot of
civilization imposed on this.


965
00:56:04.713 --> 00:56:05.942
<i>When I was 27,</i>

966
00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:09.247
<i>my mother died
of ovarian cancer.</i>


967
00:56:13.722 --> 00:56:16.521
<i>And my sense of loss
about my mother</i>


968
00:56:16.558 --> 00:56:18.720
not having lived long enough
to come to a real


969
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.253
and full acceptance
was enormous.


970
00:56:22.731 --> 00:56:24.757
<i>My father had seen me
go through years</i>


971
00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:26.734
<i>of being alone,</i>

972
00:56:26.768 --> 00:56:29.795
<i>and through
a serious depression.</i>


973
00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:31.704
- You can't relive
what happened before,


974
00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.333
the tragedies that you've had.

975
00:56:33.408 --> 00:56:35.707
The difficulties you've had
in growing up are past,


976
00:56:35.744 --> 00:56:38.976
and you're very successful.
So feel very blessed.


977
00:56:40.415 --> 00:56:40.973
We don't have everything.

978
00:56:41.016 --> 00:56:44.646
We don't have your mother,
but we have a very good life.


979
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.984
<i>- I used to
confuse love and acceptance,</i>


980
00:56:49.024 --> 00:56:53.359
<i>and through this whole process,
I felt unloved by my parents.</i>


981
00:56:57.299 --> 00:56:59.962
<i>But as I went along,
meeting all of these people</i>


982
00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:03.494
<i>and hearing their stories,
I found that everyone who</i>


983
00:57:03.538 --> 00:57:07.839
has kids has kids with flaws
and problems,


984
00:57:07.876 --> 00:57:10.345
and nobody goes around saying,

985
00:57:10.378 --> 00:57:13.507
"I'd like to turn my kids in
for a better model."


986
00:57:15.383 --> 00:57:17.352
<i>You love your children.</i>

987
00:57:18.787 --> 00:57:21.723
<i>It isn't really up to you.</i>

988
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:26.728
They just have come along
and changed you.


989
00:58:05.867 --> 00:58:09.031
<i>- Every mother
in the world would understand</i>


990
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:14.134
that a mother can't just
stop loving a child.


991
00:58:18.847 --> 00:58:20.816
<i>We just didn't see this coming.</i>

992
00:58:24.519 --> 00:58:25.919
Hey. Renting the truck.

993
00:58:25.954 --> 00:58:26.978
- Derrick Grace.

994
00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:28.785
Yeah, Derrick Grace.

995
00:58:28.857 --> 00:58:32.624
- Are you guys moving into
a home or apartment or...


996
00:58:32.694 --> 00:58:35.425
- Actually, we moved
from here to Texas.


997
00:58:35.463 --> 00:58:37.864
But we left a few things
back in the shed,


998
00:58:37.899 --> 00:58:40.494
so we're going to be
clearing all of that out.


999
00:58:52.414 --> 00:58:53.712
- God!

1000
00:58:55.417 --> 00:58:56.817
- What?

1001
00:58:56.885 --> 00:58:58.854
- Shh...

1002
00:59:04.426 --> 00:59:05.860
- Lots and lots of pictures.

1003
00:59:07.896 --> 00:59:11.196
There's Trevor.
Our undefeated U-12 team.


1004
00:59:12.066 --> 00:59:14.035
- Yeah.
He still had his braces.


1005
00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:17.869
- These are all Trevor.
Trevor driving his Jeep.


1006
00:59:23.912 --> 00:59:25.847
Here's the journal.
There you go.


1007
00:59:25.914 --> 00:59:28.008
Take those pages out,
and save it.


1008
00:59:31.586 --> 00:59:34.215
- You know, that's all?

1009
00:59:34.456 --> 00:59:35.696
- What?
- There wasn't too much.


1010
00:59:36.458 --> 00:59:38.654
- I think the cops took
a lot of the other stuff.


1011
00:59:46.768 --> 00:59:49.738
<i>I was at work and I got a call
from the sheriff,</i>


1012
00:59:51.172 --> 00:59:54.108
<i>and he said, you know,
there's been a crime.</i>


1013
00:59:54.476 --> 00:59:56.240
<i>He said it was Trevor,</i>

1014
00:59:57.745 --> 01:00:01.113
<i>and so I'm thinking there's
been some teenage thing.</i>


1015
01:00:01.483 --> 01:00:03.918
<i>He's had a wreck.
He's vandalized something.</i>


1016
01:00:05.954 --> 01:00:08.219
<i>A squad car comes up
and the deputy says,</i>


1017
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:10.721
"You're Mr. Reese?"
and I said, "Yes."


1018
01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:12.886
He says,
"Okay, come on. Let's go."


1019
01:00:12.961 --> 01:00:13.971
He didn't tell me anything.

1020
01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:15.964
<i>It was just like,
"Come on, we're gonna go."</i>


1021
01:00:17.899 --> 01:00:19.162
<i>We went in,</i>

1022
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.965
<i>and that's when
they tell me that a child</i>


1023
01:00:22.003 --> 01:00:25.269
has been killed and that, um,

1024
01:00:26.808 --> 01:00:29.175
you know, that Trevor did it.

1025
01:00:30.845 --> 01:00:33.940
<i>And of course, I say,
"You've got it all wrong.</i>


1026
01:00:33.982 --> 01:00:35.610
<i>I want you to take me
to see my son."</i>


1027
01:00:36.985 --> 01:00:39.545
But of course, you know,
as soon as you see him


1028
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.591
that the worst has happened,

1029
01:00:42.824 --> 01:00:46.022
and it is not going to be okay.

1030
01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:52.661
<i>Trevor got up that morning.</i>

1031
01:00:53.902 --> 01:00:56.701
<i>He went out on the trail
where we lived,</i>


1032
01:00:59.674 --> 01:01:03.770
<i>and he waited until 8-year-old
Jackson came by,</i>


1033
01:01:05.313 --> 01:01:07.612
and then he slit his throat.

1034
01:01:12.554 --> 01:01:14.614
<i>
- Trevor was 16.</i>

1035
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.216
<i>The first time I saw him</i>

1036
01:01:18.259 --> 01:01:21.161
<i>after I found out,
he was shackled,</i>


1037
01:01:21.195 --> 01:01:24.290
<i>and in prison stripes.</i>

1038
01:01:25.867 --> 01:01:29.861
And we couldn't touch him.

1039
01:01:30.572 --> 01:01:34.339
<i>He was like,
"I don't know why I did this."</i>


1040
01:01:36.711 --> 01:01:38.680
<i>- Everybody was trying
to figure out, you know,</i>


1041
01:01:38.713 --> 01:01:40.341
<i>what went wrong and why--</i>

1042
01:01:40.582 --> 01:01:42.676
why would a kid, you know,
think like this.


1043
01:01:42.717 --> 01:01:45.687
You know, because we raise our
kids better that that up here.


1044
01:01:46.187 --> 01:01:47.264
<i>- I don't think that
there's gonna</i>


1045
01:01:47.288 --> 01:01:49.689
<i>be an issue of responsibility.</i>

1046
01:01:49.724 --> 01:01:53.684
I think it's gonna be an issue
of what is his competency


1047
01:01:53.728 --> 01:01:56.357
and his understanding
and his mental status.


1048
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.037
<i>- There were three
psychiatrists, psychologists</i>


1049
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.369
<i>that we payed for,
and there were</i>


1050
01:02:04.606 --> 01:02:07.007
<i>two psychiatrists
from the state.</i>


1051
01:02:07.742 --> 01:02:10.371
<i>And they did everything.</i>

1052
01:02:10.612 --> 01:02:13.377
Scans and stuff
for schizophrenia.


1053
01:02:13.615 --> 01:02:16.915
They ran the test for
sociopath, psychopath,


1054
01:02:16.951 --> 01:02:18.044
the serial killer test.

1055
01:02:18.086 --> 01:02:21.648
You know, all those
kinda of issues.


1056
01:02:22.757 --> 01:02:25.886
<i>I kept thinking that one of
those tests was going to say,</i>


1057
01:02:25.927 --> 01:02:29.125
<i>you know, here's the ha.
But there wasn't.</i>


1058
01:02:30.064 --> 01:02:34.297
All they gave us was,
"Yeah, your son is broken."


1059
01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.740
- Some justice tonight for
the parents of a murdered


1060
01:02:38.773 --> 01:02:40.401
St. Francisville boy.

1061
01:02:40.642 --> 01:02:44.875
<i>Trevor Reese will spend the
rest of his life behind bars.</i>


1062
01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:51.776
<i>
- Trevor pled guilty to murder.</i>

1063
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:58.749
- Today is a very special day.
It is Trevor's birthday.


1064
01:02:58.793 --> 01:03:00.833
So, what we're going to do
is on the count of three,


1065
01:03:00.862 --> 01:03:03.093
we're going to sing
as loud as we can


1066
01:03:03.131 --> 01:03:05.100
"Happy Birthday"
to Trevor, okay?


1067
01:03:05.133 --> 01:03:07.693
One, two, and three.

1068
01:03:07.735 --> 01:03:12.673
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1069
01:03:12.974 --> 01:03:16.968
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1070
01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:21.145
<i>♪ Happy birthday Dear Trevor ♪</i>

1071
01:03:21.182 --> 01:03:23.293
<i>- What was
your favorite part of the day?</i>


1072
01:03:23.317 --> 01:03:24.444
- Riding Space Mountain.

1073
01:03:24.686 --> 01:03:25.779
- All right!

1074
01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:30.425
<i>- Let's give Trevor a
nice round of applause, okay?</i>


1075
01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:33.793
<i>
- All right.</i>

1076
01:03:36.831 --> 01:03:39.699
<i>- You literally
go back to when they were</i>


1077
01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:42.465
<i>in the cradle, and you wonder
if you let him cry too long</i>


1078
01:03:42.704 --> 01:03:44.798
<i>when you were trying
to teach them to sleep.</i>


1079
01:03:44.839 --> 01:03:47.274
<i>Should you have
breastfed longer?</i>


1080
01:03:47.308 --> 01:03:51.404
<i>I mean, you ask
every question in the world.</i>


1081
01:03:51.446 --> 01:03:54.280
You ask yourself everything,

1082
01:03:55.483 --> 01:03:59.011
and you keep coming back to...

1083
01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:01.147
...this happened.

1084
01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:04.454
<i>And we can't fix it.</i>

1085
01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:16.436
<i>
- That first month or two,</i>

1086
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:18.951
<i>I could have run straight on the
street hoping to get run over.</i>


1087
01:04:21.042 --> 01:04:22.840
<i>I thought, well, if I died,</i>

1088
01:04:22.877 --> 01:04:26.336
<i>then that would help atone
for the other death.</i>


1089
01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:31.481
<i>But...</i>

1090
01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:34.853
<i>there is no reconciling
on this issue.</i>


1091
01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:37.255
<i>These is no magic.</i>

1092
01:04:37.892 --> 01:04:39.485
<i>There's not a point.</i>

1093
01:04:40.228 --> 01:04:42.925
<i>You'll just carry the guilt
with you forever.</i>


1094
01:04:59.247 --> 01:05:00.545
Whoa, good tackle!

1095
01:05:02.383 --> 01:05:03.874
- You should take the trash out.

1096
01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.796
- The trash doesn't come today.

1097
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.231
- But it's Saturday.
It comes on Saturdays.


1098
01:05:07.255 --> 01:05:08.416
It doesn't come on Sundays.

1099
01:05:08.456 --> 01:05:11.051
- No. It doesn't come Fridays or Saturdays.
- It's your turn.


1100
01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:12.619
<i>
- We moved to Texas.</i>

1101
01:05:12.794 --> 01:05:14.471
- What kind of
world are we living in?


1102
01:05:14.495 --> 01:05:15.360
I don't know--

1103
01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:17.888
- Rebecca and Tyler,
what are you all doin'?


1104
01:05:17.932 --> 01:05:22.063
<i>Sometimes people
ask me if I have children,</i>


1105
01:05:22.103 --> 01:05:23.435
<i>and I will say yes,</i>

1106
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:26.908
<i>I have an 18-year-old
son in college</i>


1107
01:05:27.942 --> 01:05:30.207
<i>and a sophomore in high school.</i>

1108
01:05:30.812 --> 01:05:32.576
<i>And I don't mention Trevor.</i>

1109
01:05:33.114 --> 01:05:37.074
It's just, you know, a matter of
not wanting to get into it,


1110
01:05:37.118 --> 01:05:40.316
but not wanting to be dishonest.

1111
01:05:41.823 --> 01:05:43.416
- Welcome, welcome!
- Hi.


1112
01:05:43.457 --> 01:05:46.291
- I'd get up, but I'm trapped!

1113
01:05:48.963 --> 01:05:50.864
<i>
- When you try to tell somebody,</i>

1114
01:05:50.898 --> 01:05:52.890
<i>it just never goes well.</i>

1115
01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:55.930
<i>You know, your son killed
an 8-year old.</i>


1116
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:58.439
There's nothing redeeming
about that,


1117
01:05:58.472 --> 01:06:02.000
and therefore, if that has
happened in your family,


1118
01:06:02.043 --> 01:06:05.275
then there must be something
wrong with your family,


1119
01:06:05.313 --> 01:06:07.179
your parenting, your whatever.

1120
01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.231
<i>Like, Tyler
and Rebecca both said,</i>


1121
01:06:14.255 --> 01:06:16.520
<i>neither one of them
want to have kids.</i>


1122
01:06:20.995 --> 01:06:24.488
Because they don't want...
they're afraid.


1123
01:06:28.336 --> 01:06:31.636
<i>- I saw it like,
tear Mom and Dad apart,</i>


1124
01:06:31.873 --> 01:06:34.240
<i>and I don't want to have
to deal with that myself.</i>


1125
01:06:37.879 --> 01:06:39.643
I don't think I have that in me.

1126
01:06:45.887 --> 01:06:47.998
<i>- Everything with Trevor
was like so out of the blue,</i>


1127
01:06:48.022 --> 01:06:50.651
<i>and I feel like my parents
did everything right,</i>


1128
01:06:50.892 --> 01:06:52.053
and then it just happened.

1129
01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:54.494
Like, I would be afraid that
that would happen to me.


1130
01:06:54.528 --> 01:06:56.326
You know, I could work as
hard as I could


1131
01:06:56.364 --> 01:06:57.992
and love them as much
as I could,


1132
01:06:58.032 --> 01:07:00.467
and then something would
still go wrong.


1133
01:07:02.036 --> 01:07:03.347
<i>- This is a
call from an offender</i>


1134
01:07:03.371 --> 01:07:06.341
<i>at a Louisiana Department
of Correction facility.</i>


1135
01:07:06.374 --> 01:07:08.002
- What baby?

1136
01:07:08.142 --> 01:07:11.010
<i>- It'd be a volunteer thing
or like a part time job?</i>


1137
01:07:11.045 --> 01:07:13.173
- I think it would be
a next career,


1138
01:07:13.214 --> 01:07:14.358
like, somewhere along the way,

1139
01:07:14.382 --> 01:07:16.010
I'm going to be too old
to teach,


1140
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:18.349
and maybe I should counsel or...

1141
01:07:18.386 --> 01:07:19.149
<i>
- Are you sure?</i>

1142
01:07:19.186 --> 01:07:20.986
<i>There are some pretty old
ladies that do that.</i>


1143
01:07:22.189 --> 01:07:24.590
<i>- When does it start?
And how long is it?</i>


1144
01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.025
- It starts this summer.

1145
01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.585
<i>
- You have one minute left.</i>

1146
01:07:27.628 --> 01:07:30.621
<i>- Alright, mom.
I'll call tomorrow. Alright?</i>


1147
01:07:30.665 --> 01:07:32.566
<i>
- I'm gonna leave Dad alone.</i>

1148
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.367
<i>I talked to him yesterday and the day
before.</i>- Yeah. All right. Just...


1149
01:07:36.404 --> 01:07:37.235
All right. Love you.

1150
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:40.002
He says your sister's game
is tied 1-1 at the half.


1151
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:42.938
<i>- Yay. Love you.</i>
- Love you too. Bye-bye.


1152
01:07:44.078 --> 01:07:45.671
<i>
- The caller has hung up.</i>

1153
01:07:50.418 --> 01:07:52.387
- Did you all
buy some biscuits or no?


1154
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.252
- Biscuits.

1155
01:07:57.425 --> 01:07:59.519
There's the chicken.

1156
01:07:59.961 --> 01:08:01.054
Can he have chicken scraps?

1157
01:08:01.095 --> 01:08:02.586
No.

1158
01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:04.408
Yes, you got tender tummy.

1159
01:08:04.432 --> 01:08:07.402
<i>
- In these past six years,</i>

1160
01:08:07.435 --> 01:08:09.404
<i>I'd say we're much
tighter and closer...</i>


1161
01:08:09.437 --> 01:08:11.463
All right. I'm here. I'm here.

1162
01:08:11.973 --> 01:08:14.966
- ...but we're afraid
to expect too much.


1163
01:08:17.445 --> 01:08:20.677
Because...
we've lost so much.


1164
01:08:21.983 --> 01:08:22.712
<i>
- There was a time where</i>

1165
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.481
<i>I felt like everything
was a lie.</i>


1166
01:08:27.121 --> 01:08:29.750
<i>Every family vacation picture
I would look at,</i>


1167
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:32.756
<i>I felt like, here I was,
thinking we were happy,</i>


1168
01:08:32.994 --> 01:08:34.758
<i>and you were so miserable.</i>

1169
01:08:34.996 --> 01:08:38.091
<i>It just felt like every time
you and I laughed together</i>


1170
01:08:38.132 --> 01:08:39.464
<i>was a lie.</i>

1171
01:08:40.134 --> 01:08:41.762
<i>I was really angry.</i>

1172
01:08:44.472 --> 01:08:48.534
I took this picture when
I went to see him Saturday.


1173
01:08:49.643 --> 01:08:51.111
Isn't that cute?

1174
01:08:51.145 --> 01:08:52.443
- That is cute.

1175
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.142
When did Trevor get glasses?

1176
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.741
Um...

1177
01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:57.012
- A couple months ago.

1178
01:09:01.022 --> 01:09:02.752
<i>
- But...</i>

1179
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.452
<i>You love your children.</i>

1180
01:09:04.492 --> 01:09:09.487
You don't get to choose
to love them, you know.


1181
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.563
You love them.

<i>the loss of his dad.</i>

1198

<i>When Charles died,
Jason nosedived.</i>


1199
01:10:28.476 --> 01:10:30.775
<i>Jason was not showering
and not shaving,</i>


1200
01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:33.371
<i>and not eating properly,
and was wondering around town</i>


1201
01:10:33.414 --> 01:10:37.283
<i>in the middle of the night,
and it was a nightmare.</i>


1202
01:10:38.252 --> 01:10:40.687
<i>And um...</i>

1203
01:10:42.823 --> 01:10:45.554
I have to, you know,
put a whole lot of things


1204
01:10:45.593 --> 01:10:48.324
into place about
my own mortality.


1205
01:10:49.263 --> 01:10:51.630
<i>I've made
financial preparations,</i>


1206
01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:54.635
<i>arranged for a co-guardian,</i>

1207
01:10:55.903 --> 01:10:58.498
but um...

1208
01:11:02.143 --> 01:11:04.305
I don't want to think about it.

1209
01:11:05.146 --> 01:11:06.590
- You know, when we
went to the hospital


1210
01:11:06.614 --> 01:11:08.378
and when we saw...

1211
01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:09.883
...when we saw him
before he died,


1212
01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:13.513
in-in my heart,
that-that really hurts.


1213
01:11:14.788 --> 01:11:16.256
Well, the best thing
that you can do


1214
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:20.660
is try to remember
the best you can...


1215
01:11:21.295 --> 01:11:24.322
the good parts, the fun parts,

1216
01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:26.892
and the important things
that he taught you.


1217
01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:29.927
- How do I feel about Elsa
in the mix...


1218
01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:32.606
just because I have um...

1219
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.270
I have a feeling because
I have a crush on her,


1220
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:39.337
even though I know she's
a fictional character?


1221
01:11:40.181 --> 01:11:42.741
- So that's okay.
That's all right.


1222
01:11:45.186 --> 01:11:46.950
You want to feel very,
very attached


1223
01:11:47.188 --> 01:11:48.588
and very, very close to somebody

1224
01:11:48.622 --> 01:11:50.750
who's not going to leave you.

1225
01:11:51.325 --> 01:11:53.794
- I do want to go to that trip
to Norway to find out


1226
01:11:53.827 --> 01:11:55.762
what's gonna happen.

1227
01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:58.923
- Going to Norway is not going
to make her any more real.


1228
01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:00.935
It's like Santa Claus.

1229
01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:03.369
You know, you tell kids,
well, Santa Claus comes


1230
01:12:03.404 --> 01:12:06.374
and brings presents
on Christmas Eve,


1231
01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:07.932
and kids believe that.

1232
01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:09.466
- I still believe in it.

1233
01:12:11.512 --> 01:12:14.311
- In your heart,
you know he's coming.


1234
01:12:14.682 --> 01:12:16.310
It's a spirit.

1235
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:17.978
- Well...

1236
01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:20.545
- I always believe in that.
- Okay.


1237
01:12:21.355 --> 01:12:22.755
Okay.

1238
01:12:30.664 --> 01:12:33.657
<i>- Sometimes I wish I didn't
have Down Syndrome.</i>


1239
01:12:34.835 --> 01:12:37.805
<i>I wouldn't gone to college,
I would've drove...</i>


1240
01:12:37.838 --> 01:12:40.239
<i>...I would've gotten married.</i>

1241
01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:44.936
<i>But it's sort of like the movie,
It's a Wonderful Life.</i>


1242
01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:47.948
<i>What happens if I wasn't born?</i>

1243
01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:54.547
<i>I wouldn't have met
my roommates.</i>


1244
01:12:54.855 --> 01:12:59.623
<i>If I said hello to them
it would be as strangers.</i>


1245
01:12:59.893 --> 01:13:04.854
<i>We wouldn't be friends.
It would be erased.</i>


1246
01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:07.491
<i>It would all be erased
if I decided</i>


1247
01:13:07.534 --> 01:13:10.561
<i>to wish I didn't have
Down Syndrome.</i>


1248
01:13:15.276 --> 01:13:18.508
So, um, I may have
to... um...


1249
01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:27.049
So, I may have to stick
to what I have.


1250
01:13:34.728 --> 01:13:38.028
- We not having any Splenda
but we do have Sweet & Low.


1251
01:13:38.532 --> 01:13:39.761
- We can use that.

1252
01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:39.857
Careful with this.

1253
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.462
Careful with this because
of the side effect.


1254
01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:44.614
You have to be
careful with that.


1255
01:13:44.638 --> 01:13:46.402
- What's the side effect?

1256
01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:49.943
- Cancer.

1257
01:14:08.462 --> 01:14:10.021
- Delicious.

1258
01:14:10.798 --> 01:14:13.029
- 19 Years at the same job.

1259
01:14:13.067 --> 01:14:14.968
I'm getting old.

1260
01:14:15.469 --> 01:14:17.447
- If you're getting
old, I'm getting old, too.


1261
01:14:18.939 --> 01:14:20.498
- We-we all are.

1262
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.407
- The three of us,

1263
01:14:22.443 --> 01:14:25.106
we've made 13 years
in this house.


1264
01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:26.878
- Big number.

1265
01:14:26.914 --> 01:14:28.576
- 13 Years in this house.

1266
01:14:28.615 --> 01:14:30.447
We've always found ways
to get along.


1267
01:14:30.484 --> 01:14:32.680
- Exactly, we always do.

1268
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.586
Isn't that right, Jason?

1269
01:14:34.822 --> 01:14:37.018
- It's not just how
we get along.


1270
01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:38.992
It's about, um...

1271
01:14:39.026 --> 01:14:41.461
I sort of like lost the word.

1272
01:14:41.662 --> 01:14:45.463
What I'm trying to say is
that we became...


1273
01:14:46.834 --> 01:14:48.962
...we became something.

1274
01:14:49.002 --> 01:14:50.766
What?

1275
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.638
Friends.

1276
01:14:54.675 --> 01:14:56.143
- Deeper than that.

1277
01:14:56.377 --> 01:14:57.140
How much deeper?

1278
01:14:57.378 --> 01:15:00.746
Family?
- Family. Thank you, Ray.


1279
01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:02.642
That we became a family

1280
01:15:02.683 --> 01:15:05.084
because we've been
living in this house.


1281
01:15:05.152 --> 01:15:11.717
- I think we should be
officially a family of friends.


1282
01:15:17.398 --> 01:15:18.508
All for one and one for all.

1283
01:15:18.532 --> 01:15:20.160
All for one and one for all.

1284
01:15:20.401 --> 01:15:21.528
- Yeah.

1285
01:15:23.704 --> 01:15:27.505
- Sorry, I'm
getting a little emotional.


1286
01:15:27.541 --> 01:15:28.509
It's all right.
Nothing happening.


1287
01:15:28.542 --> 01:15:29.542
Yeah.

1288
01:15:39.887 --> 01:15:41.185
Hi, Jack. How are you?

1289
01:15:41.422 --> 01:15:44.119
You ready?
Have a seat right here.


1290
01:15:45.726 --> 01:15:47.366
So, remember when
you were here last time,


1291
01:15:47.428 --> 01:15:49.863
we talked about you were
going to do the clear braces.


1292
01:15:52.065 --> 01:15:53.556
- Okay. 
- Okay.

1293
01:15:53.901 --> 01:15:55.870
Good job.

1294
01:15:56.570 --> 01:16:04.637
A
-I
-G
-H
-T

1295
01:16:04.812 --> 01:16:08.442
So, are my teeth always
going to be straight?


1296
01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:10.193
You'll have a retainer that
you'll have to wear


1297
01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:12.652
and that will
keep them straight.


1298
01:16:12.686 --> 01:16:14.326
So yes. As long as you
wear your retainer,


1299
01:16:14.455 --> 01:16:16.947
your teeth will always
be straight.


1300
01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:18.893
- Do you have a further question

1301
01:16:18.926 --> 01:16:20.827
or does that clarify that?

1302
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:27.190
- G
-I
-E...

1303
01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:29.567
Girls here.

1304
01:16:30.471 --> 01:16:35.739
I
-C
-O
-M
-E

1305
01:16:36.944 --> 01:16:38.242
Girls, here I come!

1306
01:16:42.616 --> 01:16:44.915
Yeah, man.
Girls, watch out!


1307
01:16:44.952 --> 01:16:46.463
- He will come again into glory

1308
01:16:46.487 --> 01:16:48.080
to judge the living
and the dead,


1309
01:16:48.121 --> 01:16:50.750
and I look forward to the
resurrection of the dead


1310
01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:52.589
and the life in the
world to come.


1311
01:16:52.626 --> 01:16:53.753
Amen.

1312
01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:01.511
<i>
- He is not what we thought</i>

1313
01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:04.835
<i>he was going to be
and he's not like us at all.</i>


1314
01:17:06.507 --> 01:17:08.271
This looks great.
Can you close your mouth?


1315
01:17:08.509 --> 01:17:09.772
That's it.
Right there.


1316
01:17:11.144 --> 01:17:13.272
Both hands up here.
We're gonna scrub. Ready?


1317
01:17:28.195 --> 01:17:29.629
<i>I tell him, "You're not normal,</i>

1318
01:17:29.663 --> 01:17:32.633
<i>but that's not so bad.</i>

1319
01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:35.795
Normal is pretty average,
and you're well above average.


1320
01:17:35.836 --> 01:17:38.806
I mean, you are..."

1321
01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.587
He is he's abnormal
in a really good way.


1322
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:02.655
T
-H
-E...

1323
01:18:02.696 --> 01:18:04.028
The.

1324
01:18:05.566 --> 01:18:06.966
- P-E
P-R-E


1325
01:18:11.705 --> 01:18:12.968
Okay.

1326
01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:17.041
<i>My best friend is Grant.</i>

1327
01:18:20.581 --> 01:18:23.745
<i>He lives the damn autistic
life like me.</i>


1328
01:19:00.053 --> 01:19:04.218
<i>A Lost Boy plateaus
in his autistic mind.</i>


1329
01:19:05.626 --> 01:19:08.960
<i>A Real Boy has a future,
like anyone else.</i>


1330
01:19:12.866 --> 01:19:16.394
<i>The day was awesome
'cause I was with my tribe.</i>


1331
01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:39.951
- You holdin' it together?

1332
01:19:39.993 --> 01:19:41.825
- Try not to act awkward.
- What?


1333
01:19:41.862 --> 01:19:43.262
- Try not to act awkward.

1334
01:19:43.296 --> 01:19:46.289
- I'm not gonna act awkward.
I'm smooth.


1335
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:50.780
Leah, how tall are you?

1336
01:19:50.804 --> 01:19:51.999
- 3' 11" and a half.

1337
01:19:52.039 --> 01:19:54.099
The half's real important.

1338
01:19:54.141 --> 01:19:55.734
Make sure you get that on there.

1339
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:58.744
- All right.
Then we're going to


1340
01:19:58.779 --> 01:20:00.699
go right down the hallway
to the ultrasound room.


1341
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:03.109
<i>- Now, I know you had one
miscarriage in the past.</i>


1342
01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:04.982
<i>Do you know how far along
you were at that...?</i>


1343
01:20:05.018 --> 01:20:06.782
<i>- Seven weeks.
- Seven weeks. Okay.</i>


1344
01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.448
<i>I'm just gonna take a peek here.</i>

1345
01:20:29.176 --> 01:20:30.474
- Is there a heartbeat?

1346
01:20:30.711 --> 01:20:32.339
- That's the heartbeat.
Yeah.


1347
01:20:35.348 --> 01:20:36.839
That is so amazing.

1348
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:38.809
Look at that fired-up shear.

1349
01:20:52.866 --> 01:20:54.343
Most people don't get
a minivan until after


1350
01:20:54.367 --> 01:20:55.494
they've had kids.

1351
01:20:56.737 --> 01:20:58.171
That's not why we've
got a minivan.


1352
01:21:04.745 --> 01:21:05.855
So, we figured that we'd

1353
01:21:05.879 --> 01:21:07.472
give you an advanced
Christmas present.


1354
01:21:07.514 --> 01:21:09.813
So, Mom and Dad,
can you open that?


1355
01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:23.854
What's this?

1356
01:21:23.897 --> 01:21:25.057
- Is that what I think it is?

1357
01:21:26.133 --> 01:21:27.533
Is that an ult-?

1358
01:21:41.782 --> 01:21:43.307
I'm so happy!

1359
01:21:49.089 --> 01:21:50.887
God bless you!

1360
01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:53.090
- Hey, Mom.

1361
01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:58.191
I know you can't make
anything out there, but...


1362
01:21:58.565 --> 01:22:00.898
- There's not much there.
- There's not much there yet.


1363
01:22:00.934 --> 01:22:02.232
- I can see it.
Yeah.


1364
01:22:02.269 --> 01:22:05.000
There is the head.
There's an arm. There's a leg.


1365
01:22:05.272 --> 01:22:07.070
I think I could even see a nose.

1366
01:22:07.107 --> 01:22:08.405
- Geez, Mom!

1367
01:22:08.441 --> 01:22:10.103
- You think, Ma?

1368
01:22:16.283 --> 01:22:18.582
- There's a lot to
think about now.


1369
01:22:18.819 --> 01:22:21.311
- Yeah.
It's gonna be a journey.


1370
01:22:32.432 --> 01:22:34.594
I, John, take you, Andrew...

1371
01:22:34.835 --> 01:22:36.531
I, John, take you, Andrew...

1372
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.436
To be my lifelong partner.

1373
01:22:38.471 --> 01:22:40.099
To be my lifelong partner.

1374
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.608
To have and to hold.

1375
01:22:41.842 --> 01:22:42.571
To have and to hold.

1376
01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:43.941
From this day forward.

1377
01:22:43.977 --> 01:22:45.377
From this day forward.

1378
01:22:45.412 --> 01:22:47.108
<i>
- All of us, every one of us</i>

1379
01:22:47.147 --> 01:22:50.276
has mountains that we
have to climb,


1380
01:22:50.317 --> 01:22:51.478
and we have to do it.

1381
01:22:51.518 --> 01:22:53.453
We have to climb those mountains

1382
01:22:53.486 --> 01:22:56.320
if we want our
ultimate fulfillment.


1383
01:22:57.991 --> 01:22:59.402
And the reason
I'm telling you this is because


1384
01:22:59.426 --> 01:23:01.622
no one knows better than I do.

1385
01:23:01.862 --> 01:23:03.956
Andrew has had his
mountains to climb.


1386
01:23:03.997 --> 01:23:07.126
Difficult mountains to climb.

1387
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.596
I could wish no more for you,
Andrew and John,


1388
01:23:11.638 --> 01:23:15.166
than a marriage such as I had
with Andrew's mother,


1389
01:23:17.344 --> 01:23:19.540
only longer.

1390
01:23:20.881 --> 01:23:21.881
Thank you.

1391
01:23:25.518 --> 01:23:28.147
<i>
- I think I had grown up with</i>

1392
01:23:28.188 --> 01:23:31.249
<i>a sense that there was
a right way to be.</i>


1393
01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:35.991
- We hereby make our assault
on conventional morality!


1394
01:23:42.035 --> 01:23:44.561
<i>
- Writing the book set me free.</i>

1395
01:23:58.318 --> 01:24:03.655
It broke me finally out of that
particular narrowness


1396
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:06.159
that had been inscribed
in my childhood.


1397
01:24:09.329 --> 01:24:12.197
<i>And it gave me the courage
to have a family</i>


1398
01:24:12.232 --> 01:24:16.169
<i>in a different way from the way
I'd imagined growing up.</i>


1399
01:24:16.937 --> 01:24:19.031
You have a sword
and you have a fishing rod.


1400
01:24:19.072 --> 01:24:20.700
That seems very appropriate.

1401
01:24:20.941 --> 01:24:23.376
- And I've got a fishing rod
with bait on it.


1402
01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:25.072
- What's the bait?

1403
01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:26.977
That little bit of seaweed.

1404
01:24:27.013 --> 01:24:28.709
Do you think there are
fish in this water?


1405
01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:30.577
I don't know.

1406
01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:32.049
I don't know either.

1407
01:24:32.085 --> 01:24:34.680
George, let's go and put on
your pajamas please.


1408
01:24:36.957 --> 01:24:38.220
Pajamas, please.

1409
01:24:41.428 --> 01:24:44.023
George, pajamas.

1410
01:24:44.097 --> 01:24:48.364
<i>I tend to find the ecstasy
hidden in ordinary joys</i>


1411
01:24:49.269 --> 01:24:53.400
<i>because I did not expect those
joys to be ordinary to me.</i>


1412
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.136
- This is book five, right?
- Right.


1413
01:24:56.276 --> 01:24:58.302
- The first chapter is called,

1414
01:24:58.345 --> 01:25:02.043
"How Shasta Set Out
on His Travels."


1415
01:25:03.984 --> 01:25:08.979
Chapter 15 is called,
"Rabadash the Ridiculous."


1416
01:25:09.022 --> 01:25:11.082
- Okay. Shall we start
reading the book?


1417
01:25:11.124 --> 01:25:12.251
- Yup.

1418
01:25:12.292 --> 01:25:13.260
- Would you like me
to read it to you?


1419
01:25:13.293 --> 01:25:16.092
- Yes.
Who is Shasta anyway?


1420
01:25:16.129 --> 01:25:18.564
- Well, we'll find out.
- I guess we're gonna find out.


1421
01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:22.090
- "This is the story of an
adventure that happened


1422
01:25:22.135 --> 01:25:26.368
in Narnia and Calormen
and the lands between them."


1423
01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:30.338
<i>John and I have
a big, spectacular family.</i>


1424
01:25:33.313 --> 01:25:35.782
<i>John is the biological father
of two children</i>


1425
01:25:36.016 --> 01:25:37.780
<i>with some lesbian friends
in Minneapolis.</i>


1426
01:25:42.322 --> 01:25:44.655
<i>My best friend from college
and I decided we'd like to</i>


1427
01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:46.785
<i>have a child,
and so we have a daughter.</i>


1428
01:25:50.497 --> 01:25:52.466
<i>And then John and I have
a son George</i>


1429
01:25:52.499 --> 01:25:54.365
<i>who lives with us full-time.</i>

1430
01:25:55.335 --> 01:25:58.794
<i>And when we had George,
our surrogate was Laura,</i>


1431
01:25:59.039 --> 01:26:02.237
<i>the mother of John's two
biological children.</i>


1432
01:26:04.244 --> 01:26:08.306
<i>So, there are six parents of
four children in three states.</i>


1433
01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:13.820
<i>You know, Tolstoy said,</i>

1434
01:26:14.054 --> 01:26:16.421
"All happy families
are the same.


1435
01:26:16.456 --> 01:26:20.484
Every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way."


1436
01:26:20.693 --> 01:26:23.162
And I used to think
that might be true.


1437
01:26:23.196 --> 01:26:27.395
But actually, I think a lot of
unhappiness is quite similar,


1438
01:26:27.434 --> 01:26:30.097
and that what's remarkable is
that all of the different ways


1439
01:26:30.136 --> 01:26:31.764
people find to be happy.

1440
01:26:45.685 --> 01:26:47.347
- You ready, Freddy?

1441
01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.319
<i>- Louisiana Department
of Corrections facility.</i>


1442
01:26:57.564 --> 01:26:59.362
<i>
- Hi, buddy.</i>

1443
01:26:59.399 --> 01:27:02.494
<i>Jamie stop. Don't walk away
from your father.</i>


1444
01:27:03.503 --> 01:27:05.131
<i>
- Here in reality.</i>

1445
01:27:05.738 --> 01:27:07.536
Everyone is different.

1446
01:27:09.876 --> 01:27:13.608
<i>Different opinions, tastes,
personalities, and beliefs.</i>


1447
01:27:18.418 --> 01:27:19.716
- Cheers!

1448
01:27:26.326 --> 01:27:27.123
<i>
- Hello.</i>

1449
01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.458
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hello.


1450
01:27:29.262 --> 01:27:31.163
- Hey, you've got everybody.

1451
01:27:31.197 --> 01:27:33.894
Rebecca and Tyler,
and your Dad, and me.


1452
01:27:34.134 --> 01:27:35.134
<i>
- Hello everybody.</i>

1453
01:27:50.617 --> 01:27:52.210
<i>
- At each sonogram,</i>

1454
01:27:52.252 --> 01:27:55.245
they take measurements
of the baby.


1455
01:27:55.288 --> 01:28:00.886
- And so, we've been told
by the doctors that it's likely


1456
01:28:00.927 --> 01:28:02.486
to be average height.

1457
01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:05.922
<i>And so, whether it's dwarf
or average size,</i>


1458
01:28:06.166 --> 01:28:08.397
<i>we're gonna love any child
that shows up.</i>


1459
01:28:08.635 --> 01:28:10.900
<i>- I always like to
put a percentage to it.</i>


1460
01:28:10.937 --> 01:28:13.600
I would say at least
a 40 percent chance


1461
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.268
that it's a little person.

1462
01:28:15.308 --> 01:28:16.606
- Where did you get that number?

1463
01:28:16.643 --> 01:28:17.643
- I just made it up.

1464
01:28:47.207 --> 01:28:48.641
Here's your little girl.

1465
01:28:48.675 --> 01:28:51.304
She was born exactly
at 8:30 on the dot.


1466
01:28:51.344 --> 01:28:52.488
As I always predicted.

1467
01:28:56.216 --> 01:28:57.826
- You better
get used to being held


1468
01:28:57.850 --> 01:28:59.216
because she's gonna
hold you a lot.


1469
01:28:59.252 --> 01:29:01.312
- And spend lots
of time together.


1470
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:03.287
Hi, little one.

1471
01:29:04.857 --> 01:29:06.849
- Being a grandma
is wonderful. isn't it?


1472
01:29:06.893 --> 01:29:07.893
Yes.

1473
01:29:09.529 --> 01:29:11.430
Hi, Hazel.

1474
01:29:11.864 --> 01:29:13.492
That's my daughter.

1475
01:29:13.866 --> 01:29:15.357
- Yeah.

1476
01:29:15.635 --> 01:29:17.297
- I'm still in shock.
