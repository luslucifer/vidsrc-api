00:03:21.624 --> 00:03:24.115
You're not saying things
that mean anything.


2
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.329
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!


3
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.797
Ain't no way you can say to me
a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.


4
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.931
- A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile.
- Forget about it.


5
00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:39.838
A Cadillac's got more acceleration.
It's got more power.


6
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.375
It's got better handling.

7
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.913
It's got more legroom for your legs.
It's got more power.


8
00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:46.242
- You just said that.
- Bingo.


9
00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.839
- What?
- You just said, "More power. "


10
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.679
- You're starting to repeat yourself.
- I said that?


11
00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:52.515
- You're getting senile.
- He got me so fucking aggravated.


12
00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:55.250
I'll tell you one thing,
Mercedes got it all over both of them.


13
00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:56.347
A Mercedes?

14
00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.428
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking
water bed, for Christ's sakes.


15
00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:02.827
- A Mercedes.
- Yeah. It's a good car.


16
00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:12.773
I'll tell you one thing, my friend.
Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.


17
00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:16.136
It's longer? Longer like what?
Longer like my dick is longer?


18
00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:18.076
No, no, no. We're not talking about
a Volkswagen.


19
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.909
What do you mean? Yeah, Volkswagen.

20
00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:22.951
Longer. Like longer.
Like in inches it's longer.


21
00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:24.610
- You don't make no fucking sense.
- It's a longer car.


22
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.280
Two fucking cars, right?
This is a car, this is a car, right?


23
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.414
Right here, okay?

24
00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:32.654
All things being equal,
the one's longer gonna get there first.


25
00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:34.252
You don't have to be fucking Einstein
to understand this.


26
00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:36.092
You know what happens
when you get there, don't you?


27
00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:38.393
- No.
- You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.


28
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.937
I'll show you a fucking picture.
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.


29
00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:44.336
That's a scientific fact. 
It's a longer car.

30
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.340
- Can I ask you guys something?
- What?


31
00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:49.434
Are you guys, you know, wise guys?

32
00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:53.146
Wise guys? What are wise guys?

33
00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:57.049
- You know...
- What makes you think we're wise guys?


34
00:04:57.453 --> 00:04:58.784
We could be cops.

35
00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:00.589
Yeah.

36
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.024
- You believed me. Undercover what?
- No, I didn't.


37
00:05:08.397 --> 00:05:10.592
- You believed me.
- No, it's just...


38
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.997
- Who's that over there?
- Who?


39
00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.766
The guy by the bar with the mustache.

40
00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.366
That's Don, Don the Jeweler.
Jilly brought him here.


41
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:21.306
What Jilly? Jilly "Four-eyes"?

42
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.346
Not that fucking hump Jilly "Four-eyes. "
Jilly, you know, from Queens.


43
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.473
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.


44
00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:33.382
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off,
he could lay it off for me?


45
00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:36.491
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.


46
00:05:36.592 --> 00:05:38.617
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.


47
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:41.788
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay it off. That's all.


48
00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:46.527
All that fucking money you owe downtown,
you'd have to lay off a fucking Brink's truck.


49
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.337
- Sonny's in love.
- I think fucking Lefty's in love.


50
00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:53.101
I'll see you.

51
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:29.842
Were you asleep?

52
00:06:31.914 --> 00:06:36.214
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


53
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.755
Go back to sleep. 
I'll call you tomorrow.

54
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:43.856
That's good, babe.

55
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.219
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go back to sleep.
I'm so tired.


56
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.888
- All right.
- All right.


57
00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:51.898
- Hey.
- Yeah.


58
00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.158
What?

59
00:06:56.071 --> 00:06:58.232
Put the phone on your pillow.

60
00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:01.468
I want to listen to you breathe.

61
00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:25.130
You Don the Jeweler?

62
00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:31.729
There. That's some beautiful thing.

63
00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:41.175
Why don't you give it to your wife?

64
00:07:41.817 --> 00:07:43.717
My wife? How am I
gonna give it to my wife?

65
00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.946
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?


66
00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:49.419
- Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.


67
00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:52.760
Hey, you for real?

68
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.757
I'm asking you
to middle a diamond for me here.


69
00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:01.164
- All I want from my end is $8,000.
- And I'm saying to you


70
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.566
is you should give it to somebody that
don't know better, because that's a fugazy.


71
00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:07.005
All right?

72
00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:11.206
That's a fugazy?
How do you know it's a fugazy?


73
00:08:11.313 --> 00:08:14.441
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- What? It's a fake.


74
00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:16.582
I know what a fugazy is.

75
00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:21.250
Hey, pal, you want to see something?

76
00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:25.691
I'm gonna show you something.

77
00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:29.995
There you go. Ain't that something?
That's a beautiful thing.


78
00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.957
Yeah, that is a beautiful thing,
but it's not my thing.


79
00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:34.399
What about this?

80
00:08:35.804 --> 00:08:37.567
What do you want me to say?
Go ahead, try and sell it,


81
00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:39.868
you want to be a dumbsky. 
Give it a shot.

82
00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:43.001
Dumbsky? You calling me a dumbsky?

83
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:45.035
You know who you're talking to, my friend?

84
00:08:45.147 --> 00:08:47.308
Hey, Left. Come on, have a spritzer.

85
00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:49.951
You want to go embarrass yourself
with this thing...


86
00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:53.988
Embarrass myself? 
My family, my children...

87
00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:57.183
My mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city


88
00:08:57.293 --> 00:08:58.920
when she walks down the block, see?

89
00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:02.327
In all the five boroughs, I'm known.
Forget about it.


90
00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:05.431
I'm known all over the fucking world.

91
00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:12.038
Anybody, ask anybody about Lefty
from Mulberry Street.


92
00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:17.072
- You're pissing up the wrong fucking tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.


93
00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.410
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going? Sit down there.


94
00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:25.420
You're gonna walk out on me?

95
00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.886
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.


96
00:09:30.993 --> 00:09:32.620
- You got a car?
- I got a car.


97
00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:35.128
Let's go get your car. Come on.

98
00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:39.927
Take care.

99
00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:55.116
Put that window up.
I'm gonna catch a draft.


100
00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:57.447
I'm getting fucking cancer over here.

101
00:09:57.953 --> 00:10:00.751
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?


102
00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.757
You a cop?
Don't ask so many fucking questions.


103
00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:08.425
Well, well, I've got to school you,
my friend. I've got to school you.


104
00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:12.724
What's the matter? You work for Jilly,
he never school you?


105
00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:14.166
School me in what?

106
00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:18.869
You don't talk until I talk to you.

107
00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:23.545
Fugazy.

108
00:10:25.014 --> 00:10:28.279
You call that ring a fugazy. You don't know
word fucking one, my friend.


109
00:10:28.384 --> 00:10:30.614
I know. I look
at you and I know.

110
00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:33.882
You a guy
can't keep his fucking mouth shut.


111
00:10:35.758 --> 00:10:37.521
Hey, I'm talking to you now.

112
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.788
Look, I've been in jewels five years.

113
00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:41.988
How do you figure
I'm gonna earn the kind of money I do


114
00:10:42.097 --> 00:10:43.894
if I can't tell a fucking zircon?

115
00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:45.990
- There's good money in it?
- What?


116
00:10:46.402 --> 00:10:47.562
What?

117
00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:50.802
- What, jewels?
- Thank you.


118
00:10:51.807 --> 00:10:54.435
Yeah. If you know what you're doing,
there is.


119
00:10:56.378 --> 00:11:00.439
Let's go to 23rd and 8th. Then we'll find
out if you know what you're doing.


120
00:11:05.554 --> 00:11:07.488
You owe me $8,000.

121
00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:12.723
No, hold on. Wait. 
I gave you the diamond.

122
00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:15.019
Left, who's this guy?

123
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.724
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?


124
00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:21.935
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?


125
00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:24.862
- Come on, you know.
- Don't you tell me what I know.


126
00:11:24.973 --> 00:11:28.306
- You know what you did, pal.
- One of you has got to be wrong.


127
00:11:28.977 --> 00:11:31.172
That's a Tiffany fucking diamond.

128
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.041
Left, that is my wife's
fucking diamond ring.


129
00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:35.309
It's a fugazy, Left.

130
00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:37.510
You took away your wife's ring?

131
00:11:37.619 --> 00:11:40.144
Look, you bring that ring to any kike
on 47th Street,


132
00:11:40.255 --> 00:11:42.018
he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

133
00:11:42.124 --> 00:11:46.288
You took away your wife's ring
to go bet on the Giants?


134
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.797
Hey, look, you don't want it.
Give it back to me, okay?


135
00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.265
- Hey, Left, come on...
- $8,000.


136
00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:57.963
Let me talk to this fucking guy for a second.
Just give me half a second, would you?


137
00:11:58.073 --> 00:11:59.472
$8,000.

138
00:11:59.575 --> 00:12:01.475
Why don't you go to the bar
and have a drink?


139
00:12:01.577 --> 00:12:04.102
Let me talk to the guy for a minute.
Come on.


140
00:12:08.016 --> 00:12:10.712
Hey, I got a fucking
black belt, pal. So you...


141
00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:12.943
Shit!

142
00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:20.656
This guy is going to fucking kill you.
You understand what I'm saying?


143
00:12:20.762 --> 00:12:22.889
We got about two minutes
to figure a way out of this thing.


144
00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:25.899
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.


145
00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:28.526
- Sorry ain't gonna do it.
- I don't want to die.


146
00:12:28.637 --> 00:12:30.036
Yeah?

147
00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:32.334
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.


148
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:33.874
Give me the keys.

149
00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:36.371
All right.

150
00:12:39.948 --> 00:12:42.041
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.


151
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.119
Lefty's stuff. 
All right, good.

152
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.720
That's for the fucking drinks, pal.

153
00:13:00.936 --> 00:13:04.667
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.


154
00:13:05.207 --> 00:13:08.108
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.


155
00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:09.335
All right.

156
00:13:10.512 --> 00:13:12.412
You scared that guy, though.

157
00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:16.114
That cracks me up.

158
00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:21.647
I got 26 fucking hits under my belt,
and you're the one he's scared of. Fuck.


159
00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:23.088
- Pull over.
- What?


160
00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:24.554
Pull over. I've got to do something.

161
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.059
- Right here?
- Yeah. Right here, pull over.


162
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.651
All right. I'm cool.

163
00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:32.190
Come on, give me a hand with this.
Pull this out, pull it.


164
00:13:32.301 --> 00:13:36.499
- You're taking the whole fucking thing apart.
- You didn't hear nothing under the dash?


165
00:13:36.605 --> 00:13:39.631
- No, I didn't hear a fucking thing.
- There it is.


166
00:13:41.577 --> 00:13:43.067
I can go right up the back.

167
00:13:43.178 --> 00:13:44.702
What the fuck are you doing down there?

168
00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:48.214
- Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?


169
00:13:48.317 --> 00:13:50.376
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?


170
00:13:50.485 --> 00:13:52.680
Did I say that? 
Did I say you got a wire?

171
00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:54.756
Say it to my face,
if you're gonna do this.

172
00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:57.484
Nothing for nothing,
but I think you owe me an apology.


173
00:13:57.593 --> 00:14:00.687
Ain't the question.
I lost a screwdriver here.


174
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.460
- You lost a what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.


175
00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:06.193
Come on. You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?


176
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:08.235
You'll find it again. 
It's down there.

177
00:14:10.138 --> 00:14:12.868
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.


178
00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:15.806
Yeah. I got the Fleetwood Brougham.

179
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:18.744
- Is that right? With the velour?
- Forget about it.


180
00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:23.344
- Are you married?
- No.


181
00:14:24.152 --> 00:14:27.019
- I got a girl out there in California.
- That's good.


182
00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:29.956
She should stay in California.

183
00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:32.818
Keep your eye out for your balls.

184
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:35.721
- Yeah, you're right.
- I'm always right.


185
00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:39.630
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.


186
00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:44.733
All the way up the line, connected guy
to wise guy to skipper to boss.


187
00:14:45.574 --> 00:14:47.405
- Yeah, I know that.
- You know?


188
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:49.340
- Yeah.
- What do you know?


189
00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:52.413
It's kind of like the army,
like a chain of command.


190
00:14:52.514 --> 00:14:56.507
The army? It ain't nothing like the army.

191
00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.284
The army is some guy you don't know

192
00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:02.846
sends you out to whack
some other guy you don't know. Army.


193
00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:10.788
- You want to check in with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.


194
00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:18.105
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.


195
00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:23.475
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, so long.


196
00:16:01.483 --> 00:16:04.714
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.


197
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.787
He keeps to himself. 
He's a jewel guy.

198
00:16:10.492 --> 00:16:12.824
- Where's he from, Jilly?
- Florida.


199
00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:14.418
- Florida.
- He's a jewel guy.


200
00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:18.659
- But Florida where? The beach?
- No, not the beach.


201
00:16:22.104 --> 00:16:23.298
I don't know.

202
00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:25.600
Wherever the fuck
the Dodgers have spring training.


203
00:16:25.707 --> 00:16:26.731
He's a stand-up guy?

204
00:16:26.842 --> 00:16:29.777
I said I knew him, Left.
I didn't say I fucked him.


205
00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:35.609
Hey, you. Come here!

206
00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:39.877
Come here.

207
00:16:41.156 --> 00:16:43.283
What do you say, Jilly? 
How you doing?

208
00:16:43.392 --> 00:16:47.852
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me, capisce?


209
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.954
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that, Jilly.


210
00:16:50.065 --> 00:16:52.727
Because if you do,
one of us is gonna whack you out.


211
00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.301
That's not good.

212
00:16:54.403 --> 00:16:56.701
All right, Jilly. 
Go back to your bath.

213
00:16:57.939 --> 00:16:59.998
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.


214
00:17:06.548 --> 00:17:09.176
When I introduce you, 
I'm gonna say,

215
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:13.218
"This is a friend of mine. "
That means you're a connected guy.


216
00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:18.149
If I said instead, "This is a friend of ours,"
that would mean you're a made guy.


217
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.352
Capisce?

218
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:21.929
Yeah, "friend of mine.
" "Friend of ours. "

219
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.261
- What do I call you? "Friend of ours," or...
- You keep your mouth shut about me.


220
00:17:25.367 --> 00:17:27.494
Know what I'm saying? Hey, Don.

221
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.567
You got a couple of fazools?

222
00:17:30.906 --> 00:17:33.534
- I got some things I got to take care of.
- Yeah.


223
00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:35.234
What do you want? $100?

224
00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:38.169
What are you doing?

225
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.646
A wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.


226
00:17:40.749 --> 00:17:43.809
A wise guy carries money in a roll.
Like this. See?


227
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:46.717
Beaner on the outside. Like that. Come on.

228
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.187
That mustache.

229
00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:54.521
You got to get rid of that mustache,
'cause that's against the rules.


230
00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:57.757
And get a pair of pants, will you?
This ain't a fucking rodeo.


231
00:17:57.866 --> 00:18:01.233
Dress like I dress. 
This is my family.

232
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.237
- More even than my own family.
- Is that right?


233
00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:09.839
- I don't got a family.
- You don't got a family?


234
00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:12.470
No, I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.


235
00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:15.542
Ain't the question,
even if you had a family.


236
00:18:16.885 --> 00:18:19.649
If this is your family,
then this is your family.


237
00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:21.779
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.


238
00:18:22.357 --> 00:18:24.052
I'm freezing my balls off.

239
00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:28.287
What do we got to be standing outside
all day in the cold for?


240
00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:31.422
- Got to show the flag.
- The flag of fucking Antarctica.


241
00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:33.291
- What's going on?
- Hey, Lefty.


242
00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:36.234
- Lefty, what do you say?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.


243
00:18:36.338 --> 00:18:37.498
How you doing?

244
00:18:37.606 --> 00:18:40.074
The good news is
my dick is now a popsicle.


245
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.447
- Hi, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny, how you doing?


246
00:18:48.683 --> 00:18:49.911
Sonny Red.

247
00:18:52.187 --> 00:18:55.020
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.


248
00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:59.850
Just stand there and look dangerous, friend.

249
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:01.986
He does look dangerous, don't he?

250
00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:04.691
You gonna make this
week's vig? I hope so.

251
00:19:05.233 --> 00:19:08.760
'Cause I don't want to have to come
looking for you. You hear me?


252
00:19:12.207 --> 00:19:15.973
- Come on, Bruno.
- I just shit in my pants, right?


253
00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:19.213
It's the boss, Donnie.

254
00:19:55.216 --> 00:19:58.117
Okay, Joe,
the Bureau wants your autograph.


255
00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:00.551
- What's that, you want me to sign it?
- Forget about it.


256
00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:01.917
"Forget about it" is right.

257
00:20:02.023 --> 00:20:06.255
Listen, by the way, they want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.


258
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:08.795
How did they even know
about the mustache?


259
00:20:09.965 --> 00:20:12.729
- Did you rat me out?
- I didn't rat you out.


260
00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:17.932
- Show and tell.
- Yeah. Nice.


261
00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:22.708
- What?
- So does he. He wants me to shave.


262
00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:24.540
- Who? Ruggiero?
- Yeah.


263
00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:28.807
Regulations. Here.

264
00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:32.847
You know something?

265
00:20:32.954 --> 00:20:35.923
I got him. I got
my hooks in the guy.

266
00:20:42.497 --> 00:20:45.489
Cloaked by the high grasses
of the African Savannah,


267
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.031
the stalking cheetah moves stealthily
towards his prey.


268
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.907
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?


269
00:20:59.014 --> 00:21:01.346
Yeah. I'm Donnie.

270
00:21:01.449 --> 00:21:03.178
- Tommy. How are you?
- Good.


271
00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:05.548
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.
- Thanks.


272
00:21:05.654 --> 00:21:08.987
- Benny's watching TV. You met Tommy?
- Yes, we met. Thank you.


273
00:21:09.124 --> 00:21:11.922
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.


274
00:21:12.027 --> 00:21:13.585
Benny, Donnie's here.

275
00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:16.063
Too late. The cheetah springs.

276
00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:18.732
Benny loves animals.

277
00:21:21.803 --> 00:21:24.897
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.


278
00:21:26.675 --> 00:21:28.404
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.


279
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.071
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.


280
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.115
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.


281
00:21:35.216 --> 00:21:37.207
Yeah, wait a minute. Here.

282
00:21:44.492 --> 00:21:48.394
I'm sorry, Left, but I'm in
a little bit of a rush here, you know? So...


283
00:21:49.597 --> 00:21:51.121
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.


284
00:21:51.232 --> 00:21:53.063
That's really nice of you.

285
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.964
Wow. Look at this.

286
00:21:59.307 --> 00:22:03.209
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.


287
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:06.075
- All right. So, happy holidays.
- Where you going?


288
00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:09.549
- I thought you was an orphan.
- Yeah.


289
00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:12.484
- So what are you gonna do?
- Left, I don't want to spoil your day.


290
00:22:12.587 --> 00:22:13.781
Come on.

291
00:22:14.489 --> 00:22:17.515
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.


292
00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:18.592
Come on.

293
00:22:19.094 --> 00:22:21.790
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?


294
00:22:21.996 --> 00:22:25.762
All they know is manicotti. A
hundred years, they'll be eating manicotti.


295
00:22:25.867 --> 00:22:28.062
- You never ate coq au vin?
- No.


296
00:22:29.738 --> 00:22:31.137
There we are.

297
00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:34.231
Can of collagen, can of tomatoes.

298
00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:38.743
- Punch of salt.
- "Punch"?


299
00:22:39.347 --> 00:22:42.714
- Punch. Punch of salt?
- "Punch" or "pinch"?


300
00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:44.785
"Punch," not "pinch. "

301
00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:47.582
- Did I say "pinch"?
- No, you said "punch. "


302
00:22:48.056 --> 00:22:50.854
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense, Donnie.


303
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.055
- You got all this, Annette?
- I can't cook special like Benny.


304
00:22:56.164 --> 00:22:58.257
Shut up, Annette. 
Forget about it.

305
00:22:59.534 --> 00:23:01.866
Wherever you go, the best cooks are men.

306
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.064
On Mars, the best cooks are gonna be men.
That's a fact.


307
00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:09.269
Wait till you taste this coq au vin.

308
00:23:09.577 --> 00:23:12.546
It's gonna melt in your mouth,
like Holy Communion.


309
00:23:13.681 --> 00:23:16.343
What the fuck is that? 
Annette, get that.

310
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.355
- Thank you.
- Sure.


311
00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:25.358
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure, Benny.


312
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.257
She's a good woman, Annette.

313
00:23:27.829 --> 00:23:29.990
One broad, that's enough for anyone.

314
00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:33.661
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple of hours, okay?


315
00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:39.365
Merry Christmas. 
Donnie, take care.

316
00:23:39.474 --> 00:23:41.305
Yeah, you, too. Take it easy.

317
00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:48.545
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?


318
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.608
What are you gonna do?

319
00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.814
Give him a smack in the mouth
once in a while.


320
00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:54.650
I got bruises on my hands.

321
00:23:57.525 --> 00:23:59.959
You don't know the worries I got, Donnie.

322
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:04.188
A woman like Annette, I can't do right
by her. I ain't got $3 in my pocket.


323
00:24:04.365 --> 00:24:07.562
I put a bet on a horse, that horse don't do
what it's supposed to do,


324
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:11.366
like every fucking thing else in my life.
I got cancer of the prick.


325
00:24:12.674 --> 00:24:14.574
My ex-wife lives in this building.

326
00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:17.201
Can you believe it?
I run into her in the elevator.


327
00:24:17.312 --> 00:24:20.338
I got to have three spritzers afterward
just to calm down after I see her.


328
00:24:20.448 --> 00:24:23.144
What are you talking about,
cancer of the prick?


329
00:24:23.484 --> 00:24:26.282
It's cancer of the prick.
You didn't know that?


330
00:24:27.689 --> 00:24:29.782
I'm in the medical books for that.

331
00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:34.961
I got this boat, too, this Bertram.

332
00:24:35.063 --> 00:24:37.497
I had to get rid of it
for money I owe Sonny Red.


333
00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:39.794
The vig alone is $3,000 a week.

334
00:24:39.901 --> 00:24:43.098
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno? That's his son.


335
00:24:43.204 --> 00:24:47.231
- I'd like to put a dent in that guy's head.
- No, you don't do that, Donnie.


336
00:24:47.408 --> 00:24:50.741
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I'm saying I wish I could.


337
00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.376
You wish?

338
00:24:53.081 --> 00:24:55.447
A guy like you
doesn't touch a made guy.

339
00:24:58.253 --> 00:25:00.153
You know what I did yesterday?

340
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.251
I went in front of all the skippers.
That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.


341
00:25:07.295 --> 00:25:11.026
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?


342
00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:13.092
I think I do.

343
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:15.965
You do? You ain't got no fucking idea,
my friend.


344
00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:20.272
Nobody can touch you now. I'm your man.

345
00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:24.240
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.


346
00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:28.208
So keep your nose
clean, be a good earner,

347
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.241
follow the rules, and who knows,

348
00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:35.049
maybe one day when they open the books,
you get straightened out.


349
00:25:36.658 --> 00:25:38.387
Become a wise guy.

350
00:25:39.093 --> 00:25:42.688
A made guy. Come on, lift your glass.

351
00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:50.270
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.


352
00:25:51.572 --> 00:25:52.596
- All right?
- All right.


353
00:25:52.707 --> 00:25:53.799
- Salute.
- Salute.


354
00:25:54.876 --> 00:25:55.900
All right, Don.

355
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.707
- Thanks a lot. It was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple hundred?


356
00:25:59.814 --> 00:26:03.511
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll get it back to you. You got it here.


357
00:26:03.918 --> 00:26:05.249
Here you go.

358
00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:08.748
- I'll get back to you on this.
- Yeah.


359
00:26:08.856 --> 00:26:11.484
- Believe me. Call me tomorrow.
- All right.


360
00:26:43.758 --> 00:26:44.986
Hello.

361
00:26:59.907 --> 00:27:02.842
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.


362
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:09.549
I was working. 
Nothing I could do.

363
00:27:10.985 --> 00:27:12.247
Working?

364
00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:14.814
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.


365
00:27:16.424 --> 00:27:19.655
- Where's the kids?
- They couldn't wait anymore.


366
00:27:21.662 --> 00:27:23.095
Well, that's nice.

367
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:25.797
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.


368
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.267
- Is that your way of saying you're sorry?
- You know I'm sorry.


369
00:27:29.604 --> 00:27:32.004
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.


370
00:27:32.106 --> 00:27:34.233
Only be sure to introduce yourself.

371
00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:36.237
They might think
you're the Fuller brush man.


372
00:27:36.344 --> 00:27:40.212
- If you knew what I was doing today...
- I don't have an idea


373
00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:45.577
- because you don't tell me, remember?
- Because it's for your own protection.


374
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.587
As if any of this is for me.

375
00:27:53.428 --> 00:27:55.487
You're getting the checks, right?

376
00:27:55.863 --> 00:27:58.764
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Then don't say it like it's nothing.


377
00:27:58.866 --> 00:28:01.426
- 'Cause it's not nothing.
- It's not nothing, but it's not a husband.


378
00:28:01.536 --> 00:28:03.868
A lot of women would disagree with you.

379
00:28:06.808 --> 00:28:09.140
Is that what you
do with all your time?

380
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.404
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.


381
00:28:12.513 --> 00:28:16.540
Seven days a week, I'm out there busting
my ass, and this is the shit I come home to.


382
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:19.245
You said it was gonna be three months.
It's going on two years.


383
00:28:19.353 --> 00:28:22.652
How do you find anything in here?
You got cereal on three shelves.


384
00:28:22.757 --> 00:28:24.816
You got cereals over here.

385
00:28:25.927 --> 00:28:28.361
Put stuff away for once. It's my job.

386
00:28:28.463 --> 00:28:30.829
- Quit my job?
- What about my job, Joe?


387
00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:35.867
Christmas Day you don't show up,
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.


388
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.530
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.


389
00:28:38.639 --> 00:28:40.698
- You just leave it alone.
- Joseph.


390
00:28:41.476 --> 00:28:43.842
- It would be easier if you tell me...
- Just give me a break.


391
00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:45.207
...what goes on with these guys,
what you do.


392
00:28:45.313 --> 00:28:47.645
Just shut up, please. 
Leave me alone.

393
00:28:57.225 --> 00:29:00.956
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don't you go pick them up?


394
00:29:01.762 --> 00:29:03.024
Where's Sherry?

395
00:29:05.933 --> 00:29:08.493
Sherry is with her boyfriend.

396
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.463
- What?
- She's at her boyfriend's.


397
00:29:13.074 --> 00:29:15.872
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 12, Joe.


398
00:29:15.977 --> 00:29:18.537
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- Okay it? What do you think?


399
00:29:18.646 --> 00:29:21.114
You can drop out of the sky like God
and bark orders?


400
00:29:21.215 --> 00:29:23.445
I am the husband and the father!
I put food on that table!


401
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.109
- Undercover husband!
- What do I get for Christmas?


402
00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:27.153
Empty fucking house!

403
00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:30.185
I'm here.

404
00:29:33.427 --> 00:29:35.054
I wanted to be alone with you.

405
00:29:37.165 --> 00:29:38.291
Oh, God.

406
00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:03.856
What happened to your 'stache?

407
00:30:05.593 --> 00:30:07.925
The B, they made me shave it off.
Can you believe that?


408
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:09.428
- They didn't.
- Yeah.


409
00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:13.325
It was the only thing
I liked about this job.


410
00:30:13.868 --> 00:30:16.894
- So, Sherry got a boyfriend?
- Yeah, she does.


411
00:30:18.673 --> 00:30:20.470
Nice kid. He's so nice.

412
00:30:22.877 --> 00:30:24.640
He's on the wrestling team.

413
00:30:26.347 --> 00:30:28.144
I'll bet he's on the wrestling team.

414
00:30:28.249 --> 00:30:30.979
Kerry's doing the catechism. So sweet.

415
00:30:32.687 --> 00:30:34.154
And they're swimming.

416
00:30:34.522 --> 00:30:37.013
Coach says he's never seen nothing like it.

417
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:42.322
There's a meet Saturday.

418
00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:52.800
What am I gonna do? We'll see.

419
00:31:06.854 --> 00:31:11.052
You know that I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.


420
00:31:14.395 --> 00:31:16.295
I'm not worried about me, Joe.

421
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.330
All right, what's going on, kids?

422
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:02.802
Am I getting the silent treatment?

423
00:32:07.782 --> 00:32:09.477
I'll make a bet with you.

424
00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:13.517
I'll bet you $20

425
00:32:14.288 --> 00:32:18.122
that you can't get through this entire meal
without saying three words.


426
00:32:18.526 --> 00:32:19.720
All right?

427
00:32:21.095 --> 00:32:22.392
You lose.

428
00:32:29.103 --> 00:32:30.434
What did she say?

429
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:35.272
What did she say?

430
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:47.244
Girls, come here a second.
Come here, Terry, Kerry.


431
00:33:48.482 --> 00:33:51.713
Come on. Sorry, sweetie.
Come on. Let's go see your sister.


432
00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:53.443
Come on upstairs.

433
00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:59.089
Let's just, let's read a book.

434
00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:22.280
Do what you're told.

435
00:34:30.624 --> 00:34:33.024
Left, it's Donnie. 
I'm checking in.

436
00:34:37.398 --> 00:34:39.866
Yeah, that's what I said. 
I'm checking in.

437
00:34:41.135 --> 00:34:43.626
No. I've been out all day. 
What's going on?

438
00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:56.010
All right. So long.

439
00:35:14.668 --> 00:35:17.398
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?


440
00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:21.532
Every morning you're reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?


441
00:35:22.209 --> 00:35:23.233
Look at this.

442
00:35:24.578 --> 00:35:28.309
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked. The fucking boss.


443
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:31.517
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked


444
00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:34.713
- and then your life gets turned around.
- Want to tell me where we're going?


445
00:35:34.822 --> 00:35:37.382
- I got sent for.
- So what does that mean?


446
00:35:37.491 --> 00:35:39.823
- You got sent for.
- What does that mean?


447
00:35:40.327 --> 00:35:41.817
What do you think it means?

448
00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:44.591
You don't wanna go? You want me
to turn around? I'll turn around.


449
00:35:44.698 --> 00:35:47.166
What are you gonna do?
Take a left off the fucking bridge?


450
00:35:47.268 --> 00:35:49.862
- Not here, I'm saying after the bridge.
- No, I gotta go.


451
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.939
You get sent for, you go. 
Sonny sent for me.

452
00:35:53.674 --> 00:35:55.005
I'm sick of this.

453
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:59.136
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?


454
00:35:59.246 --> 00:36:02.272
Not Sonny Red. Sonny Black.

455
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.380
Donnie, what are you doing? 
Put the fuck...

456
00:36:05.486 --> 00:36:07.920
Donnie, you wanna kill me
with that draft?


457
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:13.352
Left, Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?


458
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.520
Right. We're friendly.
Ain't the question, "friend. "


459
00:36:17.298 --> 00:36:20.267
The whole time Sonny Black's in the can,
the whole time...


460
00:36:20.367 --> 00:36:23.131
He's got a family, he's got a mistress.

461
00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:25.467
He's got a mistress for the mistress.

462
00:36:25.606 --> 00:36:28.700
I watched out for them, all of them.
Me, I was the only one.


463
00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:30.470
Nobody else gave a fuck.

464
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:33.739
Two hundred fazools, week in, week out.

465
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:36.975
So you took care of Sonny Black.
What are you worried about, then?


466
00:36:37.084 --> 00:36:41.180
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your fucking head.


467
00:36:41.288 --> 00:36:43.085
How am I supposed to know
if you don't explain it?


468
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.317
You think I don't know
how a hit gets set up?


469
00:36:45.426 --> 00:36:46.415
You think I don't know that?

470
00:36:46.527 --> 00:36:48.392
You know, what I know.

471
00:36:48.495 --> 00:36:51.794
How many times have I been
on the other end of that fucking phone?


472
00:36:51.899 --> 00:36:53.389
- Twenty-six times.
- Great.


473
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.559
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends.


474
00:36:55.669 --> 00:36:57.796
Donnie, I got sent for.

475
00:36:57.905 --> 00:37:02.342
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead


476
00:37:02.443 --> 00:37:04.172
and it's your best friend that does it.

477
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:26.232
Anything should happen to me,
make sure Annette gets the car.


478
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:49.680
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.


479
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.315
Look at this hand. 
This ain't a hand.

480
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.829
This is a fucking deformed Creature
from the Black Lagoon's claw I got here.


481
00:37:57.931 --> 00:37:59.558
Hey, Left.

482
00:38:22.356 --> 00:38:24.620
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.


483
00:38:26.527 --> 00:38:27.687
Gin.

484
00:38:29.063 --> 00:38:32.032
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise

485
00:38:34.535 --> 00:38:37.732
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise, neither.


486
00:38:37.838 --> 00:38:38.862
It's gin.

487
00:38:38.972 --> 00:38:40.439
What are you talking? 
You got two sevens.

488
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:41.906
I had three sevens.

489
00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:44.500
- Paulie.
- Nicky, I had three sevens.


490
00:38:44.611 --> 00:38:46.943
I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.


491
00:38:47.047 --> 00:38:49.538
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.


492
00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.878
I had three sevens.

493
00:38:50.984 --> 00:38:54.886
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.


494
00:38:54.988 --> 00:38:58.754
Fucking booths. $200 in action
and what we have we got, five?


495
00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:01.259
We're taking a beating again
this week, Sonny.


496
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:04.296
Let's go for a ride. 
I got a new car.

497
00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:13.635
Can you believe the ride on this car?

498
00:39:13.974 --> 00:39:16.909
I can't understand how they lost a war,
them Germans.


499
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.274
- I got a date out in Jersey tonight.
- Which broad is this?


500
00:39:19.379 --> 00:39:22.906
The one from the calendar.
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.


501
00:39:23.484 --> 00:39:27.545
- What's he doing looking in the mirror?
- What're you doing over there, Left?


502
00:39:27.654 --> 00:39:29.554
What's it look like I'm doing?

503
00:39:30.224 --> 00:39:31.919
I'm checking my lipstick.

504
00:39:32.526 --> 00:39:35.359
What would I do without you, Left?
What would I do?


505
00:39:35.863 --> 00:39:38.923
What about you, Donnie?
What would you do?


506
00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:42.291
Have to find yourself a new goombah,
wouldn't you?


507
00:39:43.837 --> 00:39:46.135
That was something about the boss, huh?

508
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.174
We all gotta go sometime.

509
00:39:57.117 --> 00:39:59.381
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something, or what?


510
00:39:59.486 --> 00:40:01.386
- No.
- You, wait in the car.


511
00:40:01.488 --> 00:40:03.422
- What?
- Watch the car.


512
00:40:27.314 --> 00:40:28.508
Oh, fuck!

513
00:40:28.982 --> 00:40:30.108
Shit!

514
00:40:31.852 --> 00:40:34.685
Christ, I think I shit
my pants. What is this?


515
00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:38.822
He's supposed to go
to an animal trainer somewhere.


516
00:40:39.193 --> 00:40:41.423
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.


517
00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:45.260
- Either that or he's just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?


518
00:40:45.365 --> 00:40:48.027
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.


519
00:40:48.135 --> 00:40:49.363
For me?

520
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.031
I know how you feel about animals.

521
00:40:52.139 --> 00:40:53.936
It's a gift from me.

522
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:56.273
- It's for me?
- Yeah.


523
00:40:58.278 --> 00:41:00.712
I got the power. 
Now you're under me.

524
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:05.115
- What do you mean, you got the power?
- Sonny got upped.


525
00:41:06.286 --> 00:41:08.151
What, you got upped?

526
00:41:09.022 --> 00:41:11.923
Rusty's gonna run the whole thing
from the can.


527
00:41:12.059 --> 00:41:14.857
Sonny Red's got Little Italy.
I got Brooklyn.


528
00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:17.692
That's why you sent for me?

529
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.497
Yeah, why? What did you think,
you was gonna get whacked?


530
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:26.439
Lefty thought he was gonna get whacked.

531
00:41:28.408 --> 00:41:30.399
Congratulations. Come here.

532
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.179
Good stuff.

533
00:41:41.188 --> 00:41:42.883
Grab the pussy. Let's go.

534
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.355
What am I gonna do with this?

535
00:41:50.731 --> 00:41:52.824
He thinks they smell fear.

536
00:42:20.894 --> 00:42:22.225
I'm sick of this.

537
00:42:23.664 --> 00:42:25.894
You and Sonny Black are friends.

538
00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:28.024
I got told to shut my mouth
about Sonny Black.


539
00:42:28.135 --> 00:42:32.765
How many times I stood up
to the boss himself, that cocksucker.


540
00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.030
May he rest in peace.

541
00:42:42.716 --> 00:42:45.651
You're gonna have to...
You're gonna have to...


542
00:42:46.386 --> 00:42:47.353
I got...

543
00:42:47.688 --> 00:42:49.815
I'm gonna need 40 of those burgers.

544
00:42:51.058 --> 00:42:52.286
Hold the onions.

545
00:42:55.662 --> 00:42:58.756
Sonny Black, they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.


546
00:42:59.766 --> 00:43:02.234
Thirty years busting my hump. For what?

547
00:43:02.903 --> 00:43:03.892
A lion.

548
00:43:04.004 --> 00:43:06.871
Five hours ago, you thought
you was gonna get whacked.


549
00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:11.070
- Donnie, did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.


550
00:43:11.578 --> 00:43:14.638
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?


551
00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:18.483
You're right. I misunderstood.

552
00:43:18.986 --> 00:43:22.854
Thirty years I'm earning.
Any work to be done, call Lefty.


553
00:43:23.457 --> 00:43:27.018
I never complained.
Twenty-six guys I clipped.


554
00:43:28.395 --> 00:43:31.558
Do I get upped? 
No, they pass me by.

555
00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:36.467
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.


556
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.170
Sonny was probably in
on whacking the boss.


557
00:43:39.272 --> 00:43:41.900
Of course he was
in on whacking the boss.

558
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.505
Whacking the boss.
Another thing I get left out of.


559
00:43:48.548 --> 00:43:52.382
It's like one of those, whatchamacallit,
you know, bureaucracy.


560
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.685
What bureaucracy? Ain't no bureaucracy.
What you talking about, bureaucracy?


561
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.258
Where the fuck do you get your ideas?
Bureaucracy.


562
00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:02.658
All I'm saying, I'm saying they
don't appreciate you, is what I'm saying.


563
00:44:02.763 --> 00:44:04.890
Appreciate? They appreciate you?

564
00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:08.531
- Come on, Left, I'm on your side.
- You're on my side?


565
00:44:08.635 --> 00:44:10.364
You're on my side
because I say you're on my side.


566
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.596
Hey, look. Donnie!

567
00:44:11.705 --> 00:44:14.230
Don't get
on your fucking high horse, Donnie.


568
00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:16.539
I don't like that.

569
00:44:27.754 --> 00:44:29.654
But tell you what.

570
00:44:30.957 --> 00:44:32.185
Look at that.

571
00:44:32.859 --> 00:44:35.851
I wish I had
that boat again, that Bertram.

572
00:44:38.532 --> 00:44:40.124
I wish I had that boat.

573
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.334
I'd get in my car with Annette,
I'd drive down to the pier


574
00:44:44.438 --> 00:44:46.531
I'd get on that boat and I'd go.

575
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.629
I'd go.

576
00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:51.199
East, west, north, south,
nobody'd ever find me.


577
00:44:53.713 --> 00:44:56.181
Look at this thing. 
It's a fucking insult.

578
00:45:25.846 --> 00:45:28.440
Let's go! Come on.

579
00:47:19.526 --> 00:47:21.585
I gave it to him!

580
00:47:24.097 --> 00:47:25.826
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus!


581
00:47:25.932 --> 00:47:28.457
- No, Sonny! Please.
- He's got the money.


582
00:47:57.764 --> 00:48:00.790
- He was a friend of mine.
- Broad daylight. I can't believe it.


583
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.666
What kind of people are gonna take
another man's property right off the street?


584
00:48:04.771 --> 00:48:06.432
Forget about it.

585
00:48:07.073 --> 00:48:09.234
The whole society's going down the tubes.

586
00:48:09.342 --> 00:48:11.606
We never had this kind of a problem
when Nixon was around.


587
00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:15.238
Nixon? Nixon? Forget about Nixon. Nixon.

588
00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:17.976
We had respect all over the world.

589
00:48:18.084 --> 00:48:19.415
We stood for something.

590
00:48:19.519 --> 00:48:21.510
We had law and order in the street.

591
00:48:21.621 --> 00:48:23.851
We had a little different story.

592
00:48:23.957 --> 00:48:25.424
Too bad he wasn't Sicilian.

593
00:48:26.059 --> 00:48:27.185
He was Sicilian.

594
00:48:27.294 --> 00:48:30.320
You know, last night
I'm watching Roger Grimsby on the news


595
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.024
and those Ayatollah cockamamie people
are marching through the streets,


596
00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:34.998
and they're whipping each other on the back
with whips.


597
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:36.500
Get out of here. 
I never heard of that.

598
00:48:36.603 --> 00:48:37.831
- Donnie, am I right?
- What?


599
00:48:38.038 --> 00:48:39.027
Fucking fanatics over there.

600
00:48:39.139 --> 00:48:42.131
What're you asking him for?
What're you asking him for?


601
00:48:42.242 --> 00:48:44.540
What was it, a ventriloquist act?
I asked him a question...


602
00:48:44.644 --> 00:48:46.236
But you're talking to me. 
You're asking him.

603
00:48:46.346 --> 00:48:48.371
He reads... What do you mean,
why am I asking him?


604
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:50.278
Fuck if he reads. You ask me.
What're you asking him?


605
00:48:50.383 --> 00:48:53.147
- Did you see it?
- I'm here. You're talking to me.


606
00:48:53.987 --> 00:48:55.818
You're talking to me.
What are you talking to him for?


607
00:48:55.922 --> 00:48:58.686
I talk to you, then I talk to him.
I talk to everybody.


608
00:48:58.792 --> 00:49:00.020
All right, all right, all right.

609
00:50:23.943 --> 00:50:25.877
Sonny, come here. Bobby.

610
00:50:30.617 --> 00:50:31.777
Good seeing you.

611
00:50:32.652 --> 00:50:36.850
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best, on me.


612
00:50:38.591 --> 00:50:41.253
Why don't you get him a tailor
while you're at it?


613
00:51:17.831 --> 00:51:19.389
- What do you say, Curley?
- How's it going?


614
00:51:20.099 --> 00:51:22.226
This is Dean Blanford,
he's from Washington.


615
00:51:22.335 --> 00:51:23.825
- Joe.
- Donnie.


616
00:51:23.937 --> 00:51:26.235
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.


617
00:51:26.739 --> 00:51:29.833
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy,


618
00:51:29.943 --> 00:51:32.707
- even I forget my own name.
- Yeah, is that right?


619
00:51:32.846 --> 00:51:34.905
Is it hard to cash checks?

620
00:51:36.249 --> 00:51:38.012
Dean's up from Washington.

621
00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:43.454
Yeah, you said that part already.
What's next?


622
00:51:44.123 --> 00:51:47.684
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit


623
00:51:47.827 --> 00:51:52.127
headquarters decided to transfer me
up to Sin City here.


624
00:51:52.265 --> 00:51:54.460
- What for? You want to keep an eye on me?
- No.


625
00:51:54.601 --> 00:51:56.967
To make sure you receive
the proper support.


626
00:51:57.103 --> 00:52:01.039
- The proper support.
- And to make sure, in all the hubbub,


627
00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:05.604
- there are no missed opportunities.
- Missed opportunities? Like what?


628
00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:09.146
We have an agent in Miami,
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.


629
00:52:09.282 --> 00:52:12.149
- Miami?
- His operation is potentially very sweet.


630
00:52:12.285 --> 00:52:15.777
Problem is, it's starting to languish
right now and needs jump-starting.


631
00:52:15.922 --> 00:52:18.288
The Bureau would like you
to go down there


632
00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:21.450
and see if you could interest
some of your mob friends.


633
00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:25.588
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo...
- I ain't vouching for nobody I don't know.


634
00:52:26.366 --> 00:52:28.493
I was hoping
we'd get off on the right foot here.


635
00:52:28.635 --> 00:52:31.763
What's the big deal?
You just go down and vouch for the guy.


636
00:52:32.005 --> 00:52:33.097
Sit in the sun for a week.

637
00:52:33.206 --> 00:52:36.175
- If I vouch for the guy, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.


638
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:39.540
You're not the only one out there
risking your life, bud.


639
00:52:43.049 --> 00:52:45.142
I'll let you know.

640
00:52:45.585 --> 00:52:47.143
I'll get back to you.

641
00:52:51.057 --> 00:52:52.490
He'll let us know?

642
00:52:55.995 --> 00:52:57.963
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.


643
00:52:58.498 --> 00:53:01.990
My wife says it's very in, Japanese.
She read about it in Parade magazine.


644
00:53:02.101 --> 00:53:04.001
Very big now.

645
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.535
Have seat. Take off shoes. Please.

646
00:53:10.643 --> 00:53:13.111
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.


647
00:53:13.613 --> 00:53:16.411
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding me?


648
00:53:16.583 --> 00:53:19.245
Take off your pants. What's that?

649
00:53:19.886 --> 00:53:21.353
I'm afraid it's necessary.

650
00:53:21.454 --> 00:53:24.184
- It's Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?


651
00:53:24.457 --> 00:53:27.517
- Forget about it, I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.


652
00:53:27.627 --> 00:53:30.425
Forget it, I ain't taking
my fucking shoes off.


653
00:53:30.964 --> 00:53:32.124
- Hey, Donnie.
- What?


654
00:53:32.265 --> 00:53:34.062
When in Rome...

655
00:53:34.834 --> 00:53:37.735
Nicky, who won the fucking war?

656
00:53:39.806 --> 00:53:43.503
- War? What war?
- We did. Do you want to fight it again?


657
00:53:43.676 --> 00:53:46.236
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.


658
00:53:46.813 --> 00:53:49.145
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.


659
00:53:49.282 --> 00:53:51.409
I want to eat sometime tonight.

660
00:53:51.618 --> 00:53:55.019
Take off your shoes,
or I'm gonna chop off your fucking feet.


661
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:56.917
What do you want me to do?

662
00:53:57.023 --> 00:53:59.116
You want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?


663
00:53:59.959 --> 00:54:03.690
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.


664
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.594
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this fucking prick?


665
00:54:06.699 --> 00:54:08.599
No, I ain't doing it.

666
00:54:13.206 --> 00:54:15.106
I'm afraid it's necessary.

667
00:54:17.243 --> 00:54:20.610
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take off his shoes there, Mr. Moto.


668
00:54:20.713 --> 00:54:22.271
I'm afraid it's necessary.

669
00:54:22.382 --> 00:54:25.818
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.


670
00:54:25.918 --> 00:54:28.011
You must take off your shoes.

671
00:54:38.965 --> 00:54:41.365
- You like shoes, you fuck?
- Get him down!


672
00:54:41.467 --> 00:54:43.025
You like shoes?

673
00:54:44.303 --> 00:54:45.497
Let me get in there.

674
00:54:56.115 --> 00:54:58.413
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

675
00:55:04.657 --> 00:55:07.251
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!


676
00:55:08.628 --> 00:55:12.530
- Watch him, Donnie!
- Stupid fuck!


677
00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:17.098
Kick the shit out
of him, Donnie! Kick him!

678
00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:18.997
Use those fucking boots!

679
00:55:19.706 --> 00:55:22.834
Don't you move, you fuck.
Don't you fucking move.


680
00:55:44.197 --> 00:55:45.664
You like shoes, you fuck?

681
00:55:50.136 --> 00:55:52.400
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

682
00:55:58.111 --> 00:56:00.944
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!


683
00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:03.839
Watch him, Donnie!

684
00:56:05.418 --> 00:56:07.079
Stupid fuck!

685
00:56:07.553 --> 00:56:10.545
Kick the shit out
of him, Donnie! Kick him!

686
00:56:19.098 --> 00:56:20.690
Mind your own business.

687
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.597
Just go home! Go home!

688
00:56:29.408 --> 00:56:31.603
Go home, you miserable bitch.

689
00:56:32.678 --> 00:56:34.976
What you doing?
Sonny's ready to start.


690
00:56:35.114 --> 00:56:38.379
He's not done yet. You want him to piss
all over the fucking floor?


691
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:54.464
...not sharing the cigars.
Up the block, they sell for $50 a box.


692
00:56:54.567 --> 00:56:56.034
We could sell them for $25.

693
00:56:56.135 --> 00:56:59.901
You give two or three of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.


694
00:57:00.006 --> 00:57:02.304
Give three Quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.


695
00:57:02.408 --> 00:57:03.500
I doubt it.

696
00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:06.169
I got a guy that's in the middle
of this load of Sergio Valentes.


697
00:57:06.279 --> 00:57:08.941
A dime on the vig.

698
00:57:09.048 --> 00:57:11.676
- So, what do you got on the street?
- $100,000.


699
00:57:11.784 --> 00:57:14.309
That should be $250,000
by the end of the year.


700
00:57:16.122 --> 00:57:19.091
I can get these real cheap
and I got a guy who can move them.


701
00:57:19.525 --> 00:57:21.322
Will you fucking stop that?

702
00:57:23.095 --> 00:57:25.325
How else am I supposed to open this?

703
00:57:26.399 --> 00:57:28.026
Open sesame!

704
00:57:28.267 --> 00:57:29.325
A score's a score.

705
00:57:29.435 --> 00:57:31.903
Boss, look what I got here. 
It's 100 pairs.

706
00:57:34.373 --> 00:57:37.672
Sonny Red's got $1 million a month
with his trucks in Jersey.


707
00:57:37.777 --> 00:57:40.177
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.


708
00:57:40.279 --> 00:57:43.442
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.


709
00:57:43.583 --> 00:57:44.982
You know something?

710
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:49.217
There's a guy I know down in Florida.
He says it's wide open down there.


711
00:57:50.656 --> 00:57:53.921
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.


712
00:57:55.228 --> 00:57:58.220
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.


713
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:00.629
The economy's got to be good
for us to make any real money.


714
00:58:00.766 --> 00:58:02.893
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?


715
00:58:03.002 --> 00:58:06.199
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.


716
00:58:06.305 --> 00:58:09.638
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.


717
00:58:10.009 --> 00:58:13.911
Problem up here, you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same fucking nickel.


718
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:17.476
You're from down there, Florida, Donnie?

719
00:58:18.084 --> 00:58:20.416
Lot of parking meters down in Florida.

720
00:58:30.229 --> 00:58:32.356
You guys think this is funny?

721
00:58:33.966 --> 00:58:37.527
I'm the skipper now. 
I gotta answer!

722
00:58:38.604 --> 00:58:42.802
$50,000 a month, I kick up to Rusty.
Every month!


723
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:45.106
One day, I'm gonna die.

724
00:58:45.211 --> 00:58:50.308
I'm gonna be here in this same room
with all these same fucking guys


725
00:58:50.883 --> 00:58:53.943
talking about the same fucking scams

726
00:58:54.654 --> 00:58:56.554
that never amount to nothing!

727
00:59:02.995 --> 00:59:05.987
That's how I'll know
that I've been sent to fucking hell.


728
00:59:06.198 --> 00:59:09.725
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.


729
00:59:18.044 --> 00:59:22.378
I tell you right now, we better start
earning or somebody's gonna get clipped.


730
00:59:27.687 --> 00:59:29.917
Why did you inject that, Donnie,
with Florida?


731
00:59:30.556 --> 00:59:32.251
What are you talking about?
I didn't inject nothing.


732
00:59:32.358 --> 00:59:34.258
You injected that. 
Don't tell me no.

733
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.461
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason for it.


734
00:59:37.563 --> 00:59:40.532
Now, who is this fucking guy in Florida?

735
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:45.530
Nobody. He's a guy I knew
when I lived down there, that's all.


736
00:59:46.372 --> 00:59:47.600
You vouch for this guy?

737
00:59:47.707 --> 00:59:49.675
Hey, come on. That was bullshitting around.

738
00:59:49.775 --> 00:59:52.744
Bullshitting around? What, you think
Sonny Black is just bullshitting around?


739
00:59:52.845 --> 00:59:56.110
What do I know? I don't... You know...
You think he wasn't?


740
00:59:56.215 --> 01:00:00.549
Yeah, well... Listen to me, Donnie,
I don't know what to swear on.


741
01:00:00.653 --> 01:00:03.349
My dead father, my mother who I love,
my children.


742
01:00:03.456 --> 01:00:08.519
I swear to you, Donnie, something
is going on you don't know about.


743
01:00:08.627 --> 01:00:11.755
- I was making conversation with the guy.
- Mr. Smart Conversation,


744
01:00:11.897 --> 01:00:14.730
you tell me what happens

745
01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:17.667
if Sonny Black decides
he wants to go to Florida?


746
01:00:18.137 --> 01:00:20.697
Who said he's going to go to Florida?

747
01:00:20.806 --> 01:00:24.902
Donnie, don't think
you can pull the wool over my eyes.


748
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:27.571
I see you siding up to Sonny Black.

749
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.978
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it.


750
01:00:30.116 --> 01:00:33.517
- Come on.
- I ain't siding up to Sonny Black.


751
01:00:33.652 --> 01:00:36.678
He goes to Florida, you're responsible.

752
01:00:36.856 --> 01:00:39.086
And I'm responsible
because I represent you.


753
01:00:39.191 --> 01:00:40.988
Come on. I was just bullshitting around.

754
01:00:41.127 --> 01:00:44.324
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.


755
01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:48.524
Sonny Black is one big, fat,
fucking snake in the...


756
01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:52.094
- Grass. Snake in the grass.
- You can't say that now.


757
01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:55.273
Sonny Black is a skipper.
You don't open your mouth about him.


758
01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:59.276
Lefty, this fucking guy Richie calls me up.
He says,


759
01:01:00.546 --> 01:01:03.640
"I'm getting hassled
by a couple of half-assed wise guys. "


760
01:01:03.749 --> 01:01:07.048
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.


761
01:01:07.186 --> 01:01:09.416
- He's got this nightclub to run down there.
- A nightclub?


762
01:01:09.555 --> 01:01:12.080
Got a singles bar. 
It's near the beach.

763
01:01:12.224 --> 01:01:14.215
I got two grenades in my house.

764
01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:17.726
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up. You understand?


765
01:01:17.863 --> 01:01:20.423
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.


766
01:01:20.533 --> 01:01:23.696
You understand? 
I'd die with you.

767
01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:04.574
Come on!

768
01:02:06.345 --> 01:02:08.108
Come on, Four!

769
01:02:09.048 --> 01:02:10.447
Four!

770
01:02:19.258 --> 01:02:21.158
- Shit.
- That was in.


771
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.294
Bullshit. Knocked me so far...

772
01:02:25.498 --> 01:02:26.726
Don't push me!

773
01:02:28.267 --> 01:02:30.064
I'll break your fucking head.

774
01:02:38.777 --> 01:02:41.405
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you...


775
01:02:43.949 --> 01:02:44.973
Fuck!

776
01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:49.652
Jesus Christ.

777
01:02:52.758 --> 01:02:54.089
Half hour.

778
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.520
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know, Left.


779
01:03:05.137 --> 01:03:07.537
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.


780
01:03:13.879 --> 01:03:16.939
Don, you brought the cavalry.

781
01:03:17.183 --> 01:03:18.411
Richie Gazzo.

782
01:03:19.818 --> 01:03:21.615
- How you doing?
- How you doing?


783
01:03:22.488 --> 01:03:23.648
I'm late!

784
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:28.117
You guys got a chance
to work on your suntans out here.


785
01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:42.796
Kings Court. Where every man is a king.

786
01:03:43.576 --> 01:03:47.342
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz.


787
01:03:50.382 --> 01:03:52.748
Ask him why this place
is such a fucking dump.


788
01:03:54.353 --> 01:03:57.015
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.


789
01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:00.185
I had to shut the doors.

790
01:04:00.526 --> 01:04:02.551
The way these bums had their hands
in my pockets.


791
01:04:02.695 --> 01:04:05.357
You know, $200 for this, $300 for that.

792
01:04:05.497 --> 01:04:08.159
I got a wife who does that,
you know what I mean?


793
01:04:10.569 --> 01:04:12.298
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

794
01:04:13.205 --> 01:04:17.369
- Richie, step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.


795
01:04:20.279 --> 01:04:24.079
What kind of a man has a Malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.


796
01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:27.715
- I'm telling you, this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?


797
01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:32.114
- When I knew him before, he was all right...
- You vouch for the guy?


798
01:04:32.258 --> 01:04:36.251
I'm just making an introduction. You got
to make the decision about the joint.


799
01:04:39.765 --> 01:04:42.063
This would be something, you know,

800
01:04:42.668 --> 01:04:46.069
if we had my own lounge down here,
me and you.


801
01:04:46.639 --> 01:04:48.869
- You know?
- What about Sonny?


802
01:04:51.343 --> 01:04:53.811
Donnie, don't tell me what to do, Donnie.

803
01:04:53.912 --> 01:04:55.743
I'm asking a question.

804
01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:58.647
Donnie, Sonny's down here for a vacation.

805
01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:00.719
He ain't once gotten out
of that chaise longue.


806
01:05:00.819 --> 01:05:03.014
He lies there like he's in fucking traction.

807
01:05:03.122 --> 01:05:07.024
Yeah, I know, but he did mention
that he might wanna get something going.


808
01:05:08.427 --> 01:05:12.022
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?


809
01:05:12.898 --> 01:05:15.731
Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

810
01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:18.928
I guess if everything worked out

811
01:05:19.905 --> 01:05:22.169
we could send a
few fazools up there, no?

812
01:05:26.845 --> 01:05:30.110
Thirty years I'm busting my hump.
What do I got?


813
01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.580
Even a dog
gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.


814
01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:39.216
I ought to show
something for what I did.

815
01:05:39.325 --> 01:05:41.452
- You know what I mean?
- Definitely.


816
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:44.429
This ain't New York down here.

817
01:05:45.097 --> 01:05:49.056
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.


818
01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:55.238
Down here, a guy like me could sit down
with the boss.


819
01:05:57.343 --> 01:05:59.072
You know what I'm saying?

820
01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:02.578
Get out from under,
be a free agent again.

821
01:06:04.049 --> 01:06:07.485
I'm telling you, 
Donnie, nothing but right.

822
01:06:46.392 --> 01:06:50.123
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.


823
01:06:50.262 --> 01:06:53.095
- You got to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that kind of money.


824
01:06:53.232 --> 01:06:55.894
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.


825
01:06:56.001 --> 01:06:59.698
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe.


826
01:06:59.805 --> 01:07:02.103
Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida.

827
01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:04.801
- He sits on the Commission. Did you know?
- I knew that.


828
01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:07.377
- A 70-foot boat?
- It's up to 80, actually.


829
01:07:07.479 --> 01:07:10.573
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.


830
01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:14.243
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.


831
01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.944
This is important!

832
01:07:16.588 --> 01:07:17.816
Ninety, actually.

833
01:07:17.956 --> 01:07:20.618
I did what you asked.
I came here and vouched for this guy.


834
01:07:20.759 --> 01:07:23.887
So what, I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante
out in a rubber ducky or what?


835
01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:25.930
We're gonna have to
wash your mouth out, bud.


836
01:07:26.031 --> 01:07:29.023
Does Sally Paintglass report to Nicky
or Nicky Cigars?


837
01:07:29.168 --> 01:07:31.329
- Nicky Glasses.
- Nicky Glasses?


838
01:07:33.305 --> 01:07:36.536
As I was saying,
we've got to fold Sonny into the RICO...


839
01:07:36.675 --> 01:07:40.873
- I need a boat for this fucking sit-down!
- I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up.


840
01:07:41.013 --> 01:07:42.571
Joe, I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.


841
01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:45.115
Get me a fucking boat, would you? What?

842
01:07:45.217 --> 01:07:47.185
I'm not getting anything here.

843
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:15.243
I'm worried. He's getting strung-out.

844
01:08:16.415 --> 01:08:20.613
We're getting what we want. Fuck him.

845
01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:23.914
There it is.

846
01:08:27.926 --> 01:08:30.588
Just moving behind, nice and slow.

847
01:08:32.231 --> 01:08:34.199
Why don't you count it, my friend?
Go ahead.


848
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.465
It's all there. No bullshit.

849
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.203
We're bueno?

850
01:08:42.007 --> 01:08:44.601
Pleasure doing business
with you caballeros.


851
01:08:46.612 --> 01:08:49.080
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean

852
01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:51.912
The home of the brave and the free

853
01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:01.591
- Fuck.
- Fuck!


854
01:09:04.429 --> 01:09:08.160
What are you doing? You want to
throw me in the pool? You got the balls?


855
01:09:08.467 --> 01:09:10.401
He hasn't made a pick yet.

856
01:09:10.502 --> 01:09:12.493
Forget those dogs.

857
01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:16.031
Hey, you know,
if you took my blood pressure right now,


858
01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:19.108
it'd be down 100%.

859
01:09:20.679 --> 01:09:23.045
Rusty's locked up in the can
with his fucking sinuses.


860
01:09:23.148 --> 01:09:25.343
He finds out you're down in Florida...

861
01:09:28.253 --> 01:09:30.448
I don't punch a clock for Rusty.

862
01:09:31.056 --> 01:09:33.047
Live your life like a man down here.

863
01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:34.853
Forget about it, Sonny. By tomorrow,

864
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.451
you're gonna be crying
you miss the New York bread.


865
01:09:37.563 --> 01:09:39.656
New York bread is like cake.

866
01:09:40.933 --> 01:09:43.731
Hey, two weeks you're wearing
the same fucking shirt.


867
01:09:43.835 --> 01:09:45.359
What does that mean?

868
01:09:48.106 --> 01:09:49.801
What does that mean?

869
01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:54.908
I'm not in a big hurry
to go back to New York.


870
01:09:55.013 --> 01:09:57.777
Yeah, don't worry about it. One more day,

871
01:09:58.116 --> 01:10:00.949
that fucking shirt's gonna go back
to New York on its own.


872
01:10:01.053 --> 01:10:02.680
That's why we don't
get service in this joint.


873
01:10:02.788 --> 01:10:06.224
They see you in that fucking shirt, they say,
"There's Joe Faccia Di Culo, " in that shirt.


874
01:10:09.595 --> 01:10:10.823
That's enough.

875
01:10:11.463 --> 01:10:14.660
"That's enough?"
What does that mean, "that's enough"?


876
01:10:16.635 --> 01:10:19.126
Look at him, look at him. He's mad.

877
01:10:20.639 --> 01:10:23.039
- Hey, Donnie, let's go for a walk.
- Where?


878
01:10:23.141 --> 01:10:26.201
- Come on, I'm gonna get a candy bar.
- All right.


879
01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:29.437
Look at him, that was once yellow,
that shirt.


880
01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:35.911
What are we supposed to call him now?
Sonny Florida.


881
01:10:36.371 --> 01:10:39.135
Watch out, you're gonna put him
on the warpath again.


882
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.207
Yeah.

883
01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:44.935
That shirt. That's the shirt the barber
gives you to put over your shirt.


884
01:10:51.786 --> 01:10:54.186
I want to know what you're up to.

885
01:10:54.489 --> 01:10:57.014
- What do you mean?
- Yesterday.


886
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.725
Last night?

887
01:11:01.195 --> 01:11:03.186
What were you doing last night?

888
01:11:03.331 --> 01:11:06.858
No, I'm saying, when yesterday?
What time yesterday?


889
01:11:06.968 --> 01:11:11.371
Come here. Don't mess around with me.
Yesterday fucking afternoon.


890
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.968
Nothing.

891
01:11:14.575 --> 01:11:16.941
Why has Lefty got such a hard-on
to send me back to New York?


892
01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:19.878
Oh, come on, Sonny.
That guy's busting your balls down there.


893
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:21.471
I wanna know.

894
01:11:24.652 --> 01:11:27.018
I wanna know what you got
going on down here.


895
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.179
I don't understand, Sonny.

896
01:11:28.289 --> 01:11:30.519
You wanna know about every
half-assed scam that'll amount to nothing?


897
01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:32.058
That's right.

898
01:11:35.163 --> 01:11:36.289
Look.

899
01:11:37.799 --> 01:11:39.630
I don't mean any disrespect.

900
01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:41.634
I mean, I know you're a skipper
and I'm a nobody,


901
01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:44.967
but I can't do that to Lefty.

902
01:11:45.073 --> 01:11:48.236
Listen to me, you cocksucker,
I'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.


903
01:11:48.343 --> 01:11:51.210
You understand me?
Every fucking one of you.


904
01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:55.478
This is life or death.
Not a fucking game, Donnie.


905
01:11:55.817 --> 01:11:59.446
This is my say-so. 
Now, you tell me.

906
01:12:02.223 --> 01:12:03.850
I can't do it, Sonny.

907
01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:07.223
How about if I fucking whack you
right here and now?


908
01:12:09.664 --> 01:12:11.859
Do what you have to do, Sonny.

909
01:12:12.133 --> 01:12:14.101
I can't do that to Lefty.

910
01:12:46.634 --> 01:12:48.625
- Mommy, I need some help.
- Hello?


911
01:12:48.803 --> 01:12:49.792
- Hey.
- Hey.


912
01:12:49.937 --> 01:12:51.928
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.


913
01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:54.605
- I'm in Florida.
- What are you doing in Florida?


914
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:57.007
I don't know. I'm hunting for turtles.

915
01:12:57.145 --> 01:12:59.807
What do you think I'm doing in Florida?
Honey, I'm working.


916
01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:03.213
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!


917
01:13:04.018 --> 01:13:06.543
Young lady, you are wearing this coat.

918
01:13:06.721 --> 01:13:08.450
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?


919
01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:10.217
- Is everything all right?
- What did you...


920
01:13:10.358 --> 01:13:12.383
What if I said no, Joe?
Would it make any difference?


921
01:13:12.527 --> 01:13:15.155
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.


922
01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:19.324
"John Wayne dead. 
Nation mourns. "

923
01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:25.873
How can John Wayne die?

924
01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:29.634
The fucking Indians got him.

925
01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:35.041
"Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand. "


926
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:36.710
Look at that.

927
01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:48.084
Let me talk to Kerry.
I want to talk about the Communion.


928
01:13:48.429 --> 01:13:50.556
My God, Joe. She
doesn't want to do it.

929
01:13:50.665 --> 01:13:52.895
What do you mean? 
She ain't got no choice.

930
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.594
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone, Maggie.


931
01:13:55.736 --> 01:13:59.297
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?


932
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.408
I don't know. She's acting out or something.

933
01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:03.409
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.


934
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:06.036
Maggie, I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.


935
01:14:06.314 --> 01:14:09.408
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start it with your sister.


936
01:14:09.517 --> 01:14:11.451
- Joe, I got to go.
- What?


937
01:14:11.986 --> 01:14:13.453
I love you. Shit.

938
01:14:14.622 --> 01:14:17.921
- Who's that on the phone? Richie?
- No. What did Sonny say?


939
01:14:20.128 --> 01:14:23.495
- You told Sonny about the club?
- No, I thought you did.


940
01:14:23.664 --> 01:14:27.293
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.


941
01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:45.519
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around


942
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.013
since the Mustache Petes.

943
01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:50.156
You gotta respect the man.

944
01:14:50.258 --> 01:14:52.818
- Donnie, you get that boat yet?
- No, I'm working on it.


945
01:14:53.027 --> 01:14:55.621
Don't tell me no. 
You got to get that boat.

946
01:14:57.231 --> 01:15:01.031
I reached out already.
His man says, "Lefty, he loves boats. "


947
01:15:01.135 --> 01:15:03.569
I told him a 100-foot boat.
I'm on the clothesline now.


948
01:15:03.704 --> 01:15:05.399
I told you, I'm working on it.

949
01:15:06.374 --> 01:15:10.572
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Again? Since when did I disappoint you?


950
01:15:10.711 --> 01:15:12.611
Forget about it. What's this?

951
01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:15.615
Look at that. Same
thing we call each other.

952
01:15:15.783 --> 01:15:18.445
Friend of mine, friend of ours. Good.

953
01:15:18.553 --> 01:15:21.078
But there's the double meaning. You get it?

954
01:15:21.756 --> 01:15:22.950
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.


955
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:26.082
- A boss appreciates a thing like that.
- Yeah.


956
01:15:26.427 --> 01:15:29.123
- The irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.


957
01:15:29.564 --> 01:15:32.465
Forget about it. 
Put a beaner inside here,

958
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.568
then he knows these are men of men.

959
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:37.263
You see, if I
work out the strategy right,

960
01:15:37.572 --> 01:15:39.631
you got to hold up your end now.

961
01:15:39.774 --> 01:15:41.469
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know.


962
01:15:41.609 --> 01:15:44.271
You got to hold up your end now.
You know what I'm saying?


963
01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:47.347
How much is this?
Donnie, you got something on you?


964
01:15:47.715 --> 01:15:50.411
- What are you doing there?
- How about here's $5?


965
01:15:52.653 --> 01:15:55.747
- You're doing an amazing job, you know.
- What?


966
01:15:56.357 --> 01:15:59.793
- I mean, we all think so.
- Yeah. Absolutely.


967
01:16:02.163 --> 01:16:04.256
For crying out loud. Fuck.

968
01:16:07.235 --> 01:16:09.135
- Can I ask you something?
- What?


969
01:16:09.237 --> 01:16:12.638
What's "forget about it"? What is that?

970
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:16.036
"Forget about it" is like

971
01:16:17.678 --> 01:16:19.543
if you agree with someone.

972
01:16:20.448 --> 01:16:24.179
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great
piece of ass. " "Forget about it. "


973
01:16:24.452 --> 01:16:28.013
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?


974
01:16:28.122 --> 01:16:29.555
"Forget about it. "

975
01:16:30.591 --> 01:16:33.492
It's also like if something
is the greatest thing in the world.


976
01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:36.563
Like "Minghia, those peppers!
Forget about it!" You know?


977
01:16:38.065 --> 01:16:40.431
It's also like saying, "Go to hell," too.

978
01:16:41.302 --> 01:16:46.171
Like, "Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker. "
And Paulie says, "Forget about it. "


979
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.532
Forget about it. "Paulie, forget about it. "

980
01:16:52.113 --> 01:16:56.049
Sometimes it just means, forget about it.

981
01:16:57.485 --> 01:17:00.249
All right. Thank you
very much. I got it.

982
01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:04.057
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty...


983
01:17:04.659 --> 01:17:07.719
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.


984
01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:11.764
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it?


985
01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:16.125
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?


986
01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.569
- They got a boat down here.
- What?


987
01:17:20.675 --> 01:17:23.610
- Abscam.
- That's right. It's Abscam.


988
01:17:24.211 --> 01:17:26.076
Yeah? Could we get it?

989
01:17:27.915 --> 01:17:29.246
Forget about it.

990
01:17:36.691 --> 01:17:38.318
Son of a bitch!

991
01:17:38.759 --> 01:17:40.750
Come on, son of...

992
01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:43.062
Fucking Donnie.

993
01:17:43.164 --> 01:17:46.861
Hey, Lefty,
you're not gonna fucking believe this.


994
01:17:47.034 --> 01:17:49.025
- You think this is some joke, huh?
- What?


995
01:17:49.136 --> 01:17:51.468
- You think this is funny, huh?
- What are you talking about?


996
01:17:51.572 --> 01:17:53.472
It's fucking cold.
Why is it so cold in here?


997
01:17:53.574 --> 01:17:57.977
Hey, Donnie. Listen to me, Donnie.
I know you know, all right?


998
01:17:58.212 --> 01:18:00.942
And I know you
know I know you know.

999
01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:02.744
- Right.
- Right.


1000
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:04.147
What the fuck are you talking about?

1001
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:07.550
I'm telling you, I'm freezing
to my fucking death, Donnie.


1002
01:18:07.655 --> 01:18:10.556
Yeah, fucking Greenland in here.

1003
01:18:10.825 --> 01:18:12.087
There's no knob. 
Where's the knob?

1004
01:18:12.193 --> 01:18:13.421
Thank you.

1005
01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:16.189
Well, did you call the maintenance guy?
They gotta have a...


1006
01:18:16.297 --> 01:18:18.629
Maintenance. I'm not gonna call
a maintenance guy. What are you, crazy?


1007
01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:21.395
Who knows a maintenance guy comes in,
what if he's an agent? Come on.


1008
01:18:21.502 --> 01:18:23.436
Come on, he's not an agent.
He's a fucking janitor.


1009
01:18:23.537 --> 01:18:25.129
Janitor, come on.
I don't want him touching it.


1010
01:18:25.239 --> 01:18:27.833
Put his hands on it. Who knows what
he puts in the goddamn air-conditioner.


1011
01:18:27.942 --> 01:18:31.036
Here, look at this. Here, look, look.
I got it up to 120, here. Come on.


1012
01:18:31.145 --> 01:18:34.273
Ain't no fucking...
I'm not gonna have anyone going in here.


1013
01:18:34.382 --> 01:18:37.613
You know something?
That's a fucking practical joke.


1014
01:18:37.718 --> 01:18:39.117
- That's what that is.
- It's a joke?


1015
01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.051
- Yeah.
- Where's the joke? I don't see the joke.


1016
01:18:41.155 --> 01:18:43.646
Come on, you know Sonny's
sense of humor. It's Sonny fucking around.


1017
01:18:43.758 --> 01:18:44.952
- You think this is Sonny?
- Yeah.


1018
01:18:45.059 --> 01:18:46.492
- Sonny?
- Yeah.


1019
01:18:46.594 --> 01:18:50.155
Sonny did this to me?
This is not Sonny Black, my friend.


1020
01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:54.690
No. This is you, Donnie.
You fucking cocksucker, it's you!


1021
01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:56.793
Whoa, you don't fucking call me that, Lefty.

1022
01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:59.395
- Don't call you what?
- Don't you fucking call me cocksucker.


1023
01:18:59.507 --> 01:19:01.873
Cocksucker. I'll call you anything I want.
I'll call you cocksucker.


1024
01:19:01.976 --> 01:19:03.967
Yeah, I'll call you cocksucker.
I'll call you motherfucker!


1025
01:19:04.078 --> 01:19:06.239
Yeah, you're a fucking cocksucker.

1026
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.573
- You calling me a cocksucker?
- Yeah, you like that?


1027
01:19:10.985 --> 01:19:12.646
- I'm a what?
- Cocksucker.


1028
01:19:12.753 --> 01:19:15.017
- I'm a cocksucker?
- You're a cocksucker.


1029
01:19:18.459 --> 01:19:20.893
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me over a fucking draft?


1030
01:19:20.995 --> 01:19:22.360
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you something.


1031
01:19:22.463 --> 01:19:23.430
You'd better fucking kill me.

1032
01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:25.465
Because you don't kill me tonight,
I'm gonna come in here,


1033
01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:28.057
I'm gonna chop you up and then...
I'll sneak in here and fucking kill you.


1034
01:19:28.169 --> 01:19:29.466
Oh yeah, you don't call me cocksucker.

1035
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.538
Here.

1036
01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.969
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1037
01:19:35.242 --> 01:19:37.802
- Cocksucker.
- Go ahead. Take it back.


1038
01:19:38.546 --> 01:19:39.911
- Kill me.
- Take it back, Donnie.


1039
01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:41.845
Fuck you, I'm getting my own room.

1040
01:19:41.982 --> 01:19:43.677
I'll see you tomorrow.

1041
01:19:44.018 --> 01:19:47.283
You're not gonna see me tomorrow,
for your information.


1042
01:19:47.388 --> 01:19:51.347
I got news for you, Donnie.
You won't see me tomorrow.


1043
01:19:51.759 --> 01:19:54.250
Tomorrow is Mother's Day,

1044
01:19:54.361 --> 01:19:57.330
and wise guys don't work on Mother's Day!

1045
01:19:57.431 --> 01:19:59.058
You're a cocksucker.

1046
01:20:03.037 --> 01:20:04.299
Go ahead!

1047
01:20:09.343 --> 01:20:10.469
No!

1048
01:20:11.879 --> 01:20:14.313
Give me a break! No!

1049
01:20:14.949 --> 01:20:17.747
Are you trying to get me killed
with that fucking suit?


1050
01:20:17.885 --> 01:20:20.149
Fucking car. That purple, fucking car.

1051
01:20:20.254 --> 01:20:22.882
Don't say the word "plotz. "
You understand?


1052
01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.853
Get in the back.

1053
01:20:38.973 --> 01:20:41.305
Wait a minute. 
I'll be there.

1054
01:20:48.516 --> 01:20:50.814
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty,
a friend of ours.


1055
01:20:50.951 --> 01:20:52.646
I don't know what to say.

1056
01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:55.547
To me, this is like a
great moment in my life.


1057
01:20:56.123 --> 01:20:58.114
It's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

1058
01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:01.426
That's the boat I arranged for you,
Mr. Trafficante.


1059
01:21:01.529 --> 01:21:05.659
It's got everything.
Got a full bar, any kind of music you want.


1060
01:21:05.799 --> 01:21:08.597
You want to make a telephone,
it's got telephones.


1061
01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:11.602
- Any questions, you ask me.
- Where's Sonny Black?


1062
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.603
- Sonny Black?
- Yeah.


1063
01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:18.310
Everybody, out. 
Come on, baby.

1064
01:21:18.412 --> 01:21:20.710
- It's beautiful!
- What did I tell you?


1065
01:21:24.985 --> 01:21:28.386
You brought the family.
Hey, Paul, what do you know?


1066
01:21:28.522 --> 01:21:29.853
- Nice boat.
- What do you say, Paulie?


1067
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.685
Where's Gilligan?

1068
01:21:33.527 --> 01:21:35.188
Now, that's what I call a boat.

1069
01:21:35.329 --> 01:21:37.320
Yeah, I would be... Yeah.

1070
01:21:38.566 --> 01:21:39.726
Here.

1071
01:22:19.573 --> 01:22:23.270
Sure, you can operate here.
You got to show a little respect.


1072
01:22:48.002 --> 01:22:49.526
Hey! Over here.

1073
01:23:03.517 --> 01:23:05.508
I don't even want to look at you.

1074
01:23:05.753 --> 01:23:09.450
- You know what the bow is?
- What did I do now?


1075
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:11.888
You stabbed the wrong guy
in the back, my friend.


1076
01:23:12.026 --> 01:23:15.223
What are you talking about?
You think I said something to Sonny?


1077
01:23:15.362 --> 01:23:17.193
Go to the bow. 
I'm gonna stay in the stern.

1078
01:23:17.297 --> 01:23:19.390
Go to the bow. Stay there.

1079
01:23:20.968 --> 01:23:23.163
I'm so disgusted with you, you know that?

1080
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:26.205
- You just said it.
- Just so you know.


1081
01:23:39.153 --> 01:23:42.179
- How you doing?
- That Trafficante is something else.


1082
01:23:42.289 --> 01:23:46.623
- Is that right? Is he a good old guy?
- Forget about it.


1083
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.059
That motherfucker had this all to himself
for 50 fucking years


1084
01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:52.257
and it's still a cow town.

1085
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.360
This could be like Vegas down here.

1086
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:59.205
Forget about Sonny Red
and his trucks in Jersey.


1087
01:23:59.306 --> 01:24:01.501
This is all I want. Florida.

1088
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:06.009
Tell you something. Sonny Red
is freezing his nuts off right now.


1089
01:24:08.682 --> 01:24:10.513
That's for sure.

1090
01:24:11.985 --> 01:24:14.647
All I need is
the start-up money from Rusty

1091
01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:15.812
and then we all get rich.

1092
01:24:15.956 --> 01:24:18.015
Are we heading
back to New York pretty soon?


1093
01:24:18.158 --> 01:24:21.685
Not you. I want you to represent me
down here, Donnie.


1094
01:24:22.329 --> 01:24:24.854
I want you to
be my man in Florida.

1095
01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:28.167
Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.

1096
01:24:37.544 --> 01:24:40.138
You didn't think I
knew about that, did you?

1097
01:24:41.548 --> 01:24:44.244
I think I'll send the
lion down here with you.


1098
01:24:44.451 --> 01:24:46.851
Keep that big pussy in the parking lot.

1099
01:24:48.889 --> 01:24:52.017
You know, Sonny, I really appreciate
the offer and everything,


1100
01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:54.720
but I got a lot of things going on
in New York.


1101
01:24:54.862 --> 01:24:58.923
- I'd like to keep them...
- Lefty's a dynamite guy. No doubt about it.


1102
01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.534
He looked after me when
I was in the can.

1103
01:25:01.802 --> 01:25:03.827
That's something I don't forget,

1104
01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:06.428
something that I will never ever forget.

1105
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.440
He's a stand-up guy.
He really cares about you, too.


1106
01:25:10.878 --> 01:25:12.778
Yeah, I know he does.

1107
01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:17.411
The problem is that
you think that he's helping you,


1108
01:25:17.551 --> 01:25:19.382
but he's hurting you.

1109
01:25:20.554 --> 01:25:23.022
He gets those two
or three wines in him...

1110
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.551
You know what I'm saying.

1111
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:31.921
I don't want to be
stepping on nobody's toes.


1112
01:25:32.032 --> 01:25:34.728
- If it wasn't for Left, I...
- That's it. Look.


1113
01:25:37.671 --> 01:25:39.502
You belong to me now.

1114
01:25:42.009 --> 01:25:43.169
That's it.

1115
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.447
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

1116
01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:01.454
- You believe that?
- Ulcers, Christ, they're killing me.


1117
01:26:01.562 --> 01:26:02.927
Come here.

1118
01:26:04.031 --> 01:26:05.521
Santo, this is Donnie.

1119
01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:08.760
- He's a friend of ours.
- Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.


1120
01:26:10.704 --> 01:26:13.036
- This is Donnie.
- Hi, how you doing?


1121
01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:26.048
- Give my best to Joe, will you?
- I will.


1122
01:26:26.186 --> 01:26:28.916
Snowed in. Can you believe him?

1123
01:26:29.256 --> 01:26:33.249
Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he gets stuck at an airport.


1124
01:26:33.961 --> 01:26:37.089
That's for his own protection.
I'll see you later. Okay?


1125
01:26:37.231 --> 01:26:40.098
- I hate flying.
- I know you do. Be safe.


1126
01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:44.528
Oh, sweetheart.

1127
01:26:49.743 --> 01:26:50.903
Honey.

1128
01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:56.706
Your father is so proud of you.

1129
01:27:00.187 --> 01:27:01.950
I'm going upstairs.

1130
01:27:10.797 --> 01:27:12.424
God damn it, Joe.

1131
01:27:17.971 --> 01:27:20.599
The number you have dialed
has been changed.


1132
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:24.242
The new number is unpublished
at the subscriber's request.


1133
01:27:50.437 --> 01:27:53.338
Hey, Left, get us checked in over there,
will you?


1134
01:27:59.046 --> 01:28:01.742
- Stick around. I'm going to get a paper.
- All right.


1135
01:28:07.187 --> 01:28:10.987
Jesus, Joe. That's Hollman, US Attorney,
coming at us.


1136
01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:14.150
The guy on the right.
Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?


1137
01:28:15.095 --> 01:28:17.655
Why don't you just shut the fuck up?
I'll take care of it.


1138
01:28:23.737 --> 01:28:25.728
Anything goes wrong down there,

1139
01:28:25.839 --> 01:28:29.434
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?


1140
01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:32.442
I don't want to come down here
and iron anything out.


1141
01:28:32.579 --> 01:28:35.070
- You got your plane tickets?
- Joe Pistone.


1142
01:28:37.284 --> 01:28:39.445
Remember me? Southern District...

1143
01:28:39.586 --> 01:28:42.077
What kind of fucking shit...

1144
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:45.385
- What are you doing?
- Grabbed my cock.


1145
01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:46.481
What the fuck!

1146
01:28:46.626 --> 01:28:50.062
Shut up. He's working.
Keep your mouth shut.


1147
01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:53.556
Fucking degenerate bastard.
What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.


1148
01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:56.932
I want that club up and running.
I don't care how long it takes.


1149
01:28:57.037 --> 01:28:59.301
Here comes a fucking cop.
Get the hell out of here.


1150
01:28:59.439 --> 01:29:02.499
Have a safe trip.
You have the tickets and everything?


1151
01:29:04.945 --> 01:29:06.105
Listen to me.

1152
01:29:06.213 --> 01:29:09.671
Get on the phone.
Get me on the next flight back. Understand?


1153
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:13.148
Don't call me Joe again.
I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?


1154
01:29:13.253 --> 01:29:14.982
You piece of shit.

1155
01:29:48.989 --> 01:29:51.958
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.


1156
01:29:58.065 --> 01:30:00.124
- Who made you?
- God made me.


1157
01:30:00.834 --> 01:30:04.235
- Why did God make you?
- God made me to show his goodness


1158
01:30:04.337 --> 01:30:06.532
to make me happy with him in heaven.

1159
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.234
- Where is God?
- God is everywhere.


1160
01:30:16.516 --> 01:30:18.040
Sweet dreams, angel.

1161
01:30:59.993 --> 01:31:01.654
I want a divorce.

1162
01:31:05.265 --> 01:31:06.960
He comes home at
all hours of the night

1163
01:31:07.067 --> 01:31:10.730
without announcing when, why, or where
he's been for the last three months.


1164
01:31:12.572 --> 01:31:15.871
And you know what he does?
He rearranges the cabinets.


1165
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:19.374
He remakes the bed.
He vacuums the entire house.


1166
01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:22.607
Do you know another man that vacuums?
It's abnormal.


1167
01:31:22.749 --> 01:31:25.047
- It's abnormal behavior.
- Well, you know,


1168
01:31:25.152 --> 01:31:28.451
changing the phone number and
not telling your husband is pretty normal.


1169
01:31:28.588 --> 01:31:31.682
- I don't exist, you don't exist.
- So now I know how it feels.


1170
01:31:31.892 --> 01:31:35.794
No, now I know how you feel.
I'll tell you something. It felt good.


1171
01:31:36.496 --> 01:31:39.624
Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.


1172
01:31:40.267 --> 01:31:42.565
Now I know how
it feels to be strong.

1173
01:31:44.738 --> 01:31:46.729
- You love control, don't you?
- Oh, my God.


1174
01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.239
Please, Joe, just listen.

1175
01:31:48.341 --> 01:31:51.538
Otherwise you just play out
the old pathology.


1176
01:31:53.647 --> 01:31:55.774
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.

1177
01:31:56.783 --> 01:31:58.307
Yes, he leaves.

1178
01:31:59.886 --> 01:32:03.083
He leaves me with the house

1179
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:06.751
and the kids and the bills,
but not a husband.


1180
01:32:09.496 --> 01:32:11.191
I want my husband.

1181
01:32:16.469 --> 01:32:19.165
What do you think you're running from?

1182
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:26.946
- I ain't running from nothing.
- "I ain't running from nothing. "


1183
01:32:27.047 --> 01:32:30.175
You hear yourself?
The man I married was a college man.


1184
01:32:30.917 --> 01:32:34.978
Being the distancer
forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.


1185
01:32:35.422 --> 01:32:37.947
This gives you a feeling of power.

1186
01:32:38.325 --> 01:32:41.192
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie

1187
01:32:41.428 --> 01:32:45.922
- for fulfilling her intimacy needs...
- I'm an undercover agent for the FBl, Doctor.


1188
01:32:47.234 --> 01:32:49.600
You and your Mafia faggots
can go screw each other.


1189
01:32:49.736 --> 01:32:51.363
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1190
01:32:51.471 --> 01:32:53.029
I really hope that
you can help her out

1191
01:32:53.139 --> 01:32:55.164
because obviously she's very sick.
You can see that.


1192
01:32:55.275 --> 01:32:58.108
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

1193
01:32:58.778 --> 01:33:00.541
- You.
- Now,


1194
01:33:00.947 --> 01:33:05.509
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
are Joe's intimacy days.


1195
01:33:06.152 --> 01:33:09.178
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
are Maggie's.


1196
01:33:09.422 --> 01:33:13.051
Now, on your day,
you make an intimacy request.


1197
01:33:13.627 --> 01:33:15.424
"Rub my back," or

1198
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:19.392
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"


1199
01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.198
You sit around in
your safe little fucking house


1200
01:33:23.303 --> 01:33:27.239
with your safe little fucking station wagon,
and your safe little friends.


1201
01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.831
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.

1202
01:33:29.976 --> 01:33:33.412
- "Will you rub my back?"
- You're an animal, do you know that?


1203
01:33:33.546 --> 01:33:36.845
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?


1204
01:33:37.884 --> 01:33:40.444
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?


1205
01:33:40.553 --> 01:33:41.747
It's very intimate.

1206
01:33:41.855 --> 01:33:44.585
He can take the bill he's gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.


1207
01:33:44.691 --> 01:33:46.591
You want to know
why we went to him?

1208
01:33:46.693 --> 01:33:50.254
I was hoping he could come up with
one good reason for me not to leave you


1209
01:33:50.363 --> 01:33:52.490
because I don't have one anymore.

1210
01:33:56.169 --> 01:33:58.433
What? You gonna leave me?

1211
01:33:58.538 --> 01:34:02.372
You gonna leave me, Maggie?
You don't leave me.


1212
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:11.082
- Hello.
- Hey, Annette.


1213
01:34:11.217 --> 01:34:12.912
Donnie.

1214
01:34:13.086 --> 01:34:15.213
- What's the matter?
- Where are you?


1215
01:34:19.893 --> 01:34:22.726
I'm in New York. 
I had to come back. Why?

1216
01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:26.597
- It's Tommy.
- Why, what's going on? What happened?


1217
01:34:27.233 --> 01:34:30.066
Can you give your sister
some vegetables, honey? Thank you.


1218
01:34:30.203 --> 01:34:33.934
Not with your fingers, sweetie.
What else do you need?


1219
01:34:39.112 --> 01:34:42.013
We did fractions with Miss Greenberg today
in class, you know?


1220
01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:44.383
Did you? Fractions?

1221
01:34:44.484 --> 01:34:48.750
- I got my test back and I got a 95.
- Of course you did.


1222
01:34:56.196 --> 01:34:59.256
- What's going on?
- Donnie, what are you doing here?


1223
01:34:59.366 --> 01:35:01.095
You belong in Florida.

1224
01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:03.567
I checked in with Annette
and she said something...


1225
01:35:03.670 --> 01:35:07.265
- You called her from Florida?
- I was up here. I had a few things to care of.


1226
01:35:07.674 --> 01:35:09.801
You got to go back. Come on.

1227
01:35:09.943 --> 01:35:12.605
What happened to him?
Is he gonna be all right?


1228
01:35:12.712 --> 01:35:14.077
Do I know?

1229
01:35:14.614 --> 01:35:19.017
They got 12 fucking diplomas on the wall,
and they can't tell you a fucking thing.


1230
01:35:19.686 --> 01:35:22.280
Forget about it.
Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue,


1231
01:35:22.389 --> 01:35:24.414
he's going right back to fucking up.

1232
01:35:24.524 --> 01:35:27.857
- What did he do? Did he overdose?
- That ain't the question.


1233
01:35:28.828 --> 01:35:31.023
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

1234
01:35:32.665 --> 01:35:36.863
About five million tubes.
They have a machine breathing for him.


1235
01:35:37.003 --> 01:35:40.871
Where's the fucking doctor?
You want me to go talk to this guy for you?


1236
01:35:41.007 --> 01:35:43.168
Talk to the doctor?
You gonna break his legs?


1237
01:35:43.276 --> 01:35:45.870
I'm saying, you want me to do something?
I'm here.


1238
01:35:46.012 --> 01:35:48.708
I want you to
go back down to Florida.

1239
01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:52.749
You belong to Sonny now. Believe me.

1240
01:35:52.886 --> 01:35:55.047
I came here to be with you.
I want to help you out.


1241
01:35:55.188 --> 01:35:58.521
- You're my man. I'm here for you.
- I don't want you here, Donnie.


1242
01:36:00.427 --> 01:36:03.988
You and Tommy is both
peas in a fucking pod. You don't listen.


1243
01:36:04.898 --> 01:36:06.798
You got your own ideas.

1244
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.902
You do what you want to do
up on your high horses. Everything's a joke.


1245
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:18.339
You go to La
Guardia and you get back.

1246
01:36:18.445 --> 01:36:21.039
- Get back to Florida. Get on a plane.
- I ain't going.


1247
01:36:21.147 --> 01:36:23.274
- Forget about it.
- Go on!


1248
01:36:26.252 --> 01:36:29.312
I'm gonna stay here with you.
You want to kick the shit out of me?


1249
01:36:29.422 --> 01:36:31.617
I'm gonna be right here. All right?

1250
01:36:45.638 --> 01:36:47.401
Twenty eight years.

1251
01:36:48.441 --> 01:36:51.069
You can read it on his birth certificate.

1252
01:36:51.177 --> 01:36:54.772
Bellevue Hospital. 
Now he's back, in there.

1253
01:36:55.748 --> 01:36:58.615
And I'm out here,
worried to my fucking death.


1254
01:36:59.118 --> 01:37:02.281
And he's asleep in there,
same as 28 years ago


1255
01:37:03.289 --> 01:37:05.189
with the same expression.

1256
01:37:06.893 --> 01:37:08.451
He's made no progress.

1257
01:37:09.896 --> 01:37:11.887
He ain't got no fucking respect.

1258
01:37:14.234 --> 01:37:15.599
He's my son.

1259
01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.269
His heart stopped like a watch.

1260
01:37:25.612 --> 01:37:28.206
That's what the doctor said.
Just like a watch.


1261
01:37:28.314 --> 01:37:30.214
They had to wind it back up.

1262
01:37:31.518 --> 01:37:33.782
Who knows? Maybe next time,

1263
01:37:36.155 --> 01:37:37.554
they can't.

1264
01:38:01.481 --> 01:38:04.507
He's gonna be all right. 
He'll be all right.

1265
01:38:10.056 --> 01:38:11.546
I love you, Donnie.

1266
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.897
Hey, Joe.

1267
01:38:55.001 --> 01:38:56.195
What?

1268
01:38:57.136 --> 01:38:59.001
You know the U.
S. government?

1269
01:38:59.105 --> 01:39:00.094
Yeah.

1270
01:39:00.206 --> 01:39:04.404
The U.S. government you swore an oath
and dedicated your life to?


1271
01:39:04.877 --> 01:39:06.174
Yeah. Why?

1272
01:39:07.747 --> 01:39:09.146
We got audited.

1273
01:39:34.207 --> 01:39:35.834
Hey, let's make a toast to Sonny, huh?

1274
01:39:35.942 --> 01:39:38.206
To Sonny and our new Florida business.

1275
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:54.319
Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

1276
01:39:54.427 --> 01:39:56.861
- What's going on, Red?
- You know the boys.


1277
01:40:03.002 --> 01:40:04.594
I hear you was in Florida.

1278
01:40:04.704 --> 01:40:07.730
Yeah, it's nice down there. Take the sun.

1279
01:40:08.174 --> 01:40:09.937
You got friends down there?

1280
01:40:11.544 --> 01:40:13.774
Everybody's nice down there.

1281
01:40:13.946 --> 01:40:17.006
The people, they're
very friendly down there.


1282
01:40:18.117 --> 01:40:19.482
Nice color.

1283
01:40:22.588 --> 01:40:23.885
Thank you.

1284
01:40:30.329 --> 01:40:33.264
I'm not talking to the Bureau.
There is no Bureau.


1285
01:40:33.366 --> 01:40:36.529
There's a bunch of assholes
and the I.R.S. is another bunch of assholes.


1286
01:40:36.636 --> 01:40:39.469
So what I'm asking you to do is to
place a phone call, asshole to asshole.


1287
01:40:39.572 --> 01:40:42.097
- Please calm down.
- You want me to calm down?


1288
01:40:45.678 --> 01:40:48.579
You tell this fucking auditor
that I'm coming to D.C.


1289
01:40:48.681 --> 01:40:51.377
and I'm gonna whip the shit out of him
with his calculator, you understand?


1290
01:41:03.296 --> 01:41:05.196
Let's face it, bud,
they don't audit you for...


1291
01:41:05.298 --> 01:41:06.424
Okay, I'm gonna hang up now.

1292
01:41:06.532 --> 01:41:08.432
Wait, I'm a GS-15. You can't...

1293
01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:09.962
Fucking cocksucker.

1294
01:41:13.539 --> 01:41:14.870
All right!

1295
01:41:16.776 --> 01:41:18.607
How you doing, Nicky?

1296
01:41:20.379 --> 01:41:21.744
Hey, Sonny!

1297
01:41:21.914 --> 01:41:25.008
Look at this place. 
It's unbelievable.

1298
01:41:25.918 --> 01:41:27.647
- Beautiful.
- I feel lucky tonight.


1299
01:41:27.754 --> 01:41:29.551
Look at it. Opening night.

1300
01:41:29.655 --> 01:41:31.919
This place is a goddamn palace,
for Christ's sake.


1301
01:41:42.001 --> 01:41:44.128
Terrific, Sonny. I love it.

1302
01:41:45.938 --> 01:41:48.463
- It's a fucking palace!
- How you doing?


1303
01:41:48.608 --> 01:41:50.872
How you doing? Having fun?

1304
01:41:54.947 --> 01:41:58.041
Let's try another one. Again.

1305
01:42:18.137 --> 01:42:19.468
I like it.

1306
01:42:19.672 --> 01:42:21.367
I like it bigtime.

1307
01:42:26.879 --> 01:42:30.838
- I need a steak, medium rare.
- Couple bowls of chili, extra hot.


1308
01:42:33.686 --> 01:42:35.881
Okay, Donnie, this is the take.

1309
01:42:36.022 --> 01:42:38.252
- Put this bag someplace safe.
- All right.


1310
01:42:38.357 --> 01:42:39.847
Chicken taco.

1311
01:42:53.439 --> 01:42:55.373
Just turn real slow.

1312
01:42:58.678 --> 01:43:00.407
Is there a problem, Officer?

1313
01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:03.812
- What's your name, boy?
- Donnie Brasco. What's yours?


1314
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:06.919
What are all you New York guineas
doing down here?


1315
01:43:07.019 --> 01:43:08.782
Your missus invited us.

1316
01:43:13.526 --> 01:43:16.256
Gentlemen, we're running
a charity event here.


1317
01:43:16.362 --> 01:43:19.058
- We have a permit.
- You got a permit for the lion?


1318
01:43:27.707 --> 01:43:29.732
Break it up! Break it up!

1319
01:43:41.554 --> 01:43:43.613
You fucking pigs!

1320
01:43:54.934 --> 01:43:58.995
I guess you didn't ever think
of paying these guys off, did you?


1321
01:43:59.171 --> 01:44:02.470
Where the hell am I gonna get money to go
bribing cops? Nobody authorized that.


1322
01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:29.861
You know how fucking embarrassed I am?

1323
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:33.261
The old man's people down here.

1324
01:44:34.941 --> 01:44:38.399
A year now, I got to be in my house
with the shades drawn.


1325
01:44:44.417 --> 01:44:46.442
Where's that bag?

1326
01:44:46.986 --> 01:44:49.750
They got it. They got everything.

1327
01:44:56.696 --> 01:44:58.960
That's Rusty's money.

1328
01:45:02.702 --> 01:45:04.829
- Sonny, I'm sorry...
- Shut up.


1329
01:45:05.504 --> 01:45:07.335
You shut up. Sit down.

1330
01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.405
Shut the fuck up.

1331
01:45:13.846 --> 01:45:16.474
Like this, I got to
go back to New York.

1332
01:45:17.083 --> 01:45:19.449
Make this right with Rusty.

1333
01:45:21.053 --> 01:45:23.613
Face that cocksucker Sonny Red.

1334
01:45:23.823 --> 01:45:26.451
You know, I got to say something.

1335
01:45:26.993 --> 01:45:29.359
Usually the cops are so fucking dumb.

1336
01:45:29.495 --> 01:45:32.760
It takes them three months
just to get wind something's going on.


1337
01:45:32.865 --> 01:45:35.299
Then they got to go get a warrant.

1338
01:45:35.401 --> 01:45:38.461
They got to go through them pictures.
What are they?


1339
01:45:38.571 --> 01:45:41.165
- Surveillance.
- They go to surveillance.


1340
01:45:42.174 --> 01:45:44.005
Three months taking pictures.

1341
01:45:44.110 --> 01:45:47.705
All this time,
how do these cops know so much?


1342
01:45:48.214 --> 01:45:50.978
- We just opened the fucking doors.
- What are you saying?


1343
01:45:51.083 --> 01:45:53.074
There's got to be a snitch here.

1344
01:46:04.663 --> 01:46:05.960
All right.

1345
01:46:06.599 --> 01:46:08.726
So there's a snitch.

1346
01:46:09.235 --> 01:46:12.033
We find him. We cut his prick off.

1347
01:46:12.138 --> 01:46:15.073
Leave it in his mouth.
Leave him on the street.


1348
01:46:16.342 --> 01:46:17.468
Okay?

1349
01:46:23.916 --> 01:46:26.510
What are you,
a silent partner all of a sudden?


1350
01:46:32.591 --> 01:46:35.583
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Hey, knock it off in there!


1351
01:46:35.694 --> 01:46:37.889
Shut up! Fuck you!

1352
01:46:44.203 --> 01:46:46.865
Keep it up, boy,
I'll send you out of here in a box.


1353
01:46:46.972 --> 01:46:49.941
- Did you bust it up good?
- Yeah, we busted it up.


1354
01:46:50.409 --> 01:46:52.843
He's out of business. 
You understand?

1355
01:46:52.945 --> 01:46:54.412
Yeah, I'm listening.

1356
01:46:55.114 --> 01:46:58.311
That punk is finished down here. That's it.

1357
01:46:59.351 --> 01:47:01.945
That's great. I can't believe it.

1358
01:47:02.054 --> 01:47:04.614
- All right, look, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.


1359
01:47:04.723 --> 01:47:06.350
Give me some of that cheese
with that salami, please?


1360
01:47:06.459 --> 01:47:08.359
- He busted up the club.
- Good.


1361
01:47:08.461 --> 01:47:11.021
- Take this taste out of my mouth.
- There you go.


1362
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:13.462
Now he has to answer for what happened.

1363
01:47:13.732 --> 01:47:15.563
You gonna send for him?

1364
01:47:16.035 --> 01:47:17.502
He sits down with us.

1365
01:47:17.603 --> 01:47:19.833
Bing-bada-boom, it's done.

1366
01:47:20.206 --> 01:47:22.640
The whole fucking crew. All of them.

1367
01:47:22.741 --> 01:47:23.969
I'll dust off the guns.

1368
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.004
Napkins and tablecloths, $500 scoot.

1369
01:47:57.576 --> 01:47:59.043
$500 scoot?

1370
01:47:59.178 --> 01:48:01.305
Down in Florida, it's $500 an hour.

1371
01:48:01.413 --> 01:48:04.246
You like it down there so much,
why don't you go buy some oranges?


1372
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:07.148
- What do you got there, Bullfrog?
- Dime on the vig.


1373
01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.689
I'm doing the best I can, Sonny.

1374
01:48:11.123 --> 01:48:12.420
What do you got, Nicky?

1375
01:48:12.525 --> 01:48:16.427
I got a guy boosted 30 tickets
to Chaka Khan at the Garden.


1376
01:48:18.197 --> 01:48:19.630
What about Florida?

1377
01:48:19.865 --> 01:48:22.732
I thought we weren't supposed to talk
about Florida.


1378
01:48:25.638 --> 01:48:27.128
So you never got nothing going on?

1379
01:48:27.239 --> 01:48:30.640
No. Nothing ever panned out for me, Sonny.
I couldn't catch a break.


1380
01:48:30.743 --> 01:48:34.201
- You never got nothing going on?
- What did I just say?


1381
01:48:34.747 --> 01:48:36.044
Sonny.

1382
01:48:48.427 --> 01:48:50.554
Paulie, I got a truckload of razor blades.

1383
01:48:50.663 --> 01:48:53.029
What the fuck am I gonna do
with razor blades?


1384
01:48:53.132 --> 01:48:55.600
You know how many razor blades
fit in a truck?


1385
01:48:55.701 --> 01:48:58.397
I got a guy on the inside,
works in a warehouse.


1386
01:48:58.504 --> 01:49:00.335
Has the art collection
of the Shah of Iran.

1387
01:49:02.441 --> 01:49:04.238
A sit-down where?

1388
01:49:05.978 --> 01:49:07.172
Yeah.

1389
01:49:15.321 --> 01:49:17.186
That was Sonny Red's guy.

1390
01:49:17.690 --> 01:49:20.158
Wants to have a sit-down in Little Italy.

1391
01:49:20.492 --> 01:49:21.925
I got sent for.

1392
01:49:25.531 --> 01:49:27.362
Donnie, come on.

1393
01:49:37.576 --> 01:49:39.339
Paulie, we'll take your car.

1394
01:49:39.578 --> 01:49:43.537
That cocksucker Sonny Red,
he rubbed my nose in Florida


1395
01:49:43.682 --> 01:49:45.013
because of a fucking rat!

1396
01:49:45.117 --> 01:49:46.448
Forget about it.

1397
01:49:46.619 --> 01:49:49.019
Donnie, you ride up front.

1398
01:49:49.855 --> 01:49:52.119
You know what to do
when you find that rat, right, Left?


1399
01:49:52.224 --> 01:49:54.192
Could be I found him already.

1400
01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.728
So where we headed, Sonny? Little Italy?

1401
01:50:03.869 --> 01:50:08.533
Our guy says they got a little stop
to make first. You know what I mean?


1402
01:50:49.848 --> 01:50:51.440
Let's go.

1403
01:50:59.124 --> 01:51:02.582
Where are you going? 
Wait in the car.

1404
01:51:55.414 --> 01:51:56.904
All right. Come on.

1405
01:51:57.049 --> 01:51:58.448
We still got to get downtown.

1406
01:51:58.550 --> 01:52:02.145
- How long is this gonna take?
- I got them in the drain in the laundry room.


1407
01:52:02.254 --> 01:52:04.586
- The. 22s?
- Bruno said you want the 9mm.


1408
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:06.681
- Meanwhile, where the fuck is he?
- Yeah.


1409
01:52:06.792 --> 01:52:10.125
In bed with some broad with more hair
on her lip than he's got on his head.


1410
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:13.062
- He's your kid.
- Don't remind me. Come on.


1411
01:52:13.165 --> 01:52:15.759
You think that's funny?
I don't think that's so funny.


1412
01:52:15.868 --> 01:52:16.994
All right.

1413
01:52:21.006 --> 01:52:22.997
- You don't want to listen.
- I don't think that's funny.


1414
01:52:23.108 --> 01:52:27.306
- A son should respect his father, capisce?
- Answer me. You think that's funny?


1415
01:52:28.046 --> 01:52:30.947
Shit, the bulb is out.
Watch your step, guys.


1416
01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:33.675
Big fucking surprise from a fucking spider.

1417
01:52:33.819 --> 01:52:36.515
Yeah, nothing like the surprise
Sonny Black is gonna get.


1418
01:52:36.622 --> 01:52:39.056
- You can say that again.
- Put one right here.


1419
01:52:39.158 --> 01:52:41.023
He'll never know what hit him.

1420
01:52:41.126 --> 01:52:43.560
- Goddamn right.
- He's never gonna know what hit him.


1421
01:52:43.662 --> 01:52:46.256
- I'll blow his brains right there.
- Jesus! No!


1422
01:53:06.552 --> 01:53:08.213
Bruno!

1423
01:53:33.312 --> 01:53:37.715
Okay, come on! Get him off!

1424
01:53:37.816 --> 01:53:39.215
- Sonny!
- Get him off of me!


1425
01:53:39.318 --> 01:53:41.183
Take my arm. Take my hand.

1426
01:53:43.255 --> 01:53:45.223
Jesus Christ.

1427
01:53:47.459 --> 01:53:50.326
Paulie, go get Donnie.

1428
01:54:09.615 --> 01:54:10.912
What's going on?

1429
01:54:16.755 --> 01:54:19.451
- Is everything all right?
- What?


1430
01:54:21.727 --> 01:54:23.388
Is everything all right?

1431
01:54:30.135 --> 01:54:31.227
Get out.

1432
01:54:58.163 --> 01:54:59.858
Get down there.

1433
01:55:01.333 --> 01:55:04.700
The meek want to inherit the earth,
they're gonna have to get in fucking line.


1434
01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:20.083
Look what I found.

1435
01:55:20.953 --> 01:55:22.682
Them or us.

1436
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:25.623
Nicky, you got Big Trin.

1437
01:55:25.791 --> 01:55:28.760
- Trin? I'll get a hernia.
- Shut the fuck up.


1438
01:55:29.027 --> 01:55:31.257
Donnie's gonna help you.

1439
01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:36.425
Come on, Donnie.

1440
01:55:36.602 --> 01:55:38.900
Help me fillet this fat fuck.

1441
01:55:55.153 --> 01:55:57.417
All right, all right. Come on.

1442
01:55:57.856 --> 01:55:59.448
We got work to do.

1443
01:56:45.871 --> 01:56:48.601
There was a rat in Florida, Donnie.

1444
01:56:51.043 --> 01:56:52.772
Nicky wasn't a rat.

1445
01:56:53.178 --> 01:56:55.612
You don't mention his name, all right?

1446
01:56:55.847 --> 01:56:58.941
That's what we said.
We don't mention his name.


1447
01:56:59.551 --> 01:57:02.452
Yeah. Tell yourself
whatever you have to, Left.


1448
01:57:02.721 --> 01:57:04.484
I'm not telling myself.

1449
01:57:04.623 --> 01:57:07.717
- You was down there. You have eyes.
- Twenty years you know a guy.


1450
01:57:07.826 --> 01:57:11.125
You fuck him, whack him out,
just like that? Over a lounge?


1451
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.955
- That's beautiful.
- The man held out.


1452
01:57:14.866 --> 01:57:16.128
He held out on a coke deal.

1453
01:57:16.234 --> 01:57:18.395
What does one thing
got to do with the other?


1454
01:57:18.503 --> 01:57:21.666
He could have got whacked out just for that,
for your information.


1455
01:57:21.773 --> 01:57:24.003
- There wasn't a rat in Florida.
- There was a rat.


1456
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:27.840
There was not a rat in Florida.
Richie fucked up paying off the cops.


1457
01:57:28.714 --> 01:57:30.238
What do you mean Richie fucked up?

1458
01:57:30.348 --> 01:57:34.182
That's why the club got busted.
Richie didn't pay off the fucking cops.


1459
01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:37.784
Nicky didn't have anything to do with it.

1460
01:57:37.889 --> 01:57:40.915
You don't mention his name.
That's the rules.


1461
01:57:41.059 --> 01:57:44.028
- Fuck the rules.
- That's the rules, Donnie.


1462
01:57:47.099 --> 01:57:48.259
Say his name.

1463
01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.495
- Come on.
- Say his name.


1464
01:57:50.602 --> 01:57:52.661
Come on. Nicky.

1465
01:57:53.371 --> 01:57:55.100
Say Nicky.

1466
01:57:55.273 --> 01:57:58.037
You can't say his name
because you know that I'm fucking right.


1467
01:57:58.143 --> 01:58:00.077
Say it! Say Nicky!

1468
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.243
Say his fucking name!

1469
01:58:03.515 --> 01:58:07.918
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.


1470
01:58:12.157 --> 01:58:13.818
Who the fuck am I?

1471
01:58:16.495 --> 01:58:18.486
Who am I?

1472
01:58:21.366 --> 01:58:23.800
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

1473
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:28.306
And so was he, and so are you.

1474
01:58:32.177 --> 01:58:34.441
Quit riding the fucking brake.

1475
01:58:57.202 --> 01:58:59.397
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.

1476
01:59:00.372 --> 01:59:02.897
- He looks good, huh?
- Sonny Black.


1477
01:59:09.214 --> 01:59:12.240
Congratulations, Sonny!

1478
01:59:12.417 --> 01:59:13.577
Boss!

1479
01:59:17.022 --> 01:59:20.583
- Sonny. Congratulations, Sonny.
- Congratulations.


1480
01:59:30.435 --> 01:59:32.960
- Oh, God!
- No, everything's okay, Maggie.


1481
01:59:33.972 --> 01:59:37.738
Yeah? If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?


1482
01:59:37.843 --> 01:59:40.209
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?

1483
01:59:40.412 --> 01:59:42.312
I'm not sure. That depends.

1484
01:59:42.747 --> 01:59:44.942
At that point, he became hysterical.

1485
01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:47.948
As if the Bureau were responsible
for this audit.


1486
01:59:48.053 --> 01:59:51.284
- Whereas, well, self-evidently...
- Did you ever think of giving him a raise?


1487
01:59:51.389 --> 01:59:53.823
The only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him.


1488
01:59:53.925 --> 01:59:55.085
Yeah.

1489
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.888
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.

1490
01:59:58.496 --> 01:59:59.986
So he's a supervisor.

1491
02:00:01.233 --> 02:00:04.600
But he's undercover.
He's not supervising anyone.


1492
02:00:04.703 --> 02:00:07.297
The point is,
that's the last time we heard from him.


1493
02:00:07.405 --> 02:00:10.738
Standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day.


1494
02:00:10.842 --> 02:00:13.606
Maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there, but...


1495
02:00:13.712 --> 02:00:16.510
- It was three weeks ago.
- I want you to tell me


1496
02:00:16.882 --> 02:00:18.782
where my husband is.

1497
02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:23.779
I demand that
you tell me where my husband is!


1498
02:00:23.889 --> 02:00:26.619
- We can't tell you because we don't know.
- If he gets in touch with you,


1499
02:00:26.725 --> 02:00:29.319
you have got to try
to talk sense into him.

1500
02:00:29.427 --> 02:00:32.225
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.

1501
02:00:32.364 --> 02:00:34.559
- You want me to help you out?
- Yes.


1502
02:00:35.133 --> 02:00:39.229
You want me to help out the FBl
that used my husband and sucked him dry,


1503
02:00:39.371 --> 02:00:41.999
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become SACs


1504
02:00:42.107 --> 02:00:45.235
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you


1505
02:00:45.577 --> 02:00:48.341
could get promoted to GS-16?

1506
02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.844
Maggie, come on. 
You don't mean that.

1507
02:00:53.051 --> 02:00:55.611
Let me tell you something.
I hope he crossed over.


1508
02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:59.884
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on
in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover.


1509
02:00:59.991 --> 02:01:02.585
Three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered.


1510
02:01:02.694 --> 02:01:05.561
He's right in the line of fire.
Not because he's one of us,


1511
02:01:05.664 --> 02:01:06.790
because he's one of them.

1512
02:01:06.898 --> 02:01:10.834
Who he's with and who he's close to,
they're all the top dogs now.


1513
02:01:13.004 --> 02:01:15.131
It's just not a problem we anticipated.

1514
02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:17.037
We have got to pull him out.

1515
02:01:17.175 --> 02:01:20.975
You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.


1516
02:01:21.346 --> 02:01:22.506
You think so?

1517
02:01:26.551 --> 02:01:28.485
He was here a week ago.

1518
02:01:30.855 --> 02:01:33.688
He snuck into the
house after I was asleep.

1519
02:01:36.061 --> 02:01:39.292
And he didn't even wake me up,
didn't even say hello to me.


1520
02:01:44.035 --> 02:01:46.333
He came to get his sport coat.

1521
02:02:01.219 --> 02:02:04.052
- Let's take a walk.
- All right.


1522
02:02:08.093 --> 02:02:09.856
Left, what are we doing?

1523
02:02:09.961 --> 02:02:13.226
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.


1524
02:02:16.634 --> 02:02:20.900
Here it is, Donnie.
Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.


1525
02:02:21.272 --> 02:02:24.730
Now, as long as he's on the loose,

1526
02:02:24.843 --> 02:02:26.470
ain't none of us safe.

1527
02:02:27.112 --> 02:02:28.909
- Right?
- Yeah.


1528
02:02:29.014 --> 02:02:31.448
You got no idea where the guy is?

1529
02:02:31.649 --> 02:02:35.676
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He's gonna turn up somewhere.


1530
02:02:36.688 --> 02:02:40.488
Anyway, we got the contract.

1531
02:02:44.295 --> 02:02:46.786
Now, this thing gets done right,

1532
02:02:46.898 --> 02:02:50.527
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.


1533
02:02:51.036 --> 02:02:54.164
- You know what that means?
- Yeah.


1534
02:02:54.305 --> 02:02:56.000
Yeah? What?

1535
02:02:56.141 --> 02:03:00.339
- It means I can't fuck it up.
- You read my mind.


1536
02:03:01.246 --> 02:03:05.478
- You read my mind. You can't fuck it up.
- No, I won't fuck it up.


1537
02:03:10.922 --> 02:03:13.049
You're gonna be a made guy, Donnie.

1538
02:03:13.358 --> 02:03:14.552
Capisce?

1539
02:03:15.627 --> 02:03:17.891
Yeah. All right.

1540
02:03:18.630 --> 02:03:20.257
Yeah. All right.

1541
02:03:20.965 --> 02:03:23.866
Come on. Let's go back inside!

1542
02:03:27.939 --> 02:03:30.032
- Left.
- Yeah, what?


1543
02:03:33.311 --> 02:03:35.836
What? I'm freezing here!

1544
02:03:39.617 --> 02:03:42.415
You know that boat you used to have,
that Bertram?


1545
02:03:43.555 --> 02:03:45.386
- Boat? What about it?
- Yeah, boat.


1546
02:03:45.490 --> 02:03:49.722
How much is it? A boat like that?
How much? What do you think?


1547
02:03:50.895 --> 02:03:53.864
You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300, used.


1548
02:03:53.965 --> 02:03:56.297
Why are you asking me
about boats, Donnie?


1549
02:03:56.401 --> 02:03:58.528
I was just wondering.
I was curious, you know.


1550
02:03:58.636 --> 02:04:00.331
- You're curious about boats?
- Yeah.


1551
02:04:00.438 --> 02:04:02.599
It's 10 degrees out here. I'm freezing.

1552
02:04:02.707 --> 02:04:05.699
You're asking me about boats,
after what we just said?


1553
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:08.672
You losing your marbles on me or what?

1554
02:04:08.813 --> 02:04:11.611
- No, I'm all right.
- So don't ask questions like that.


1555
02:04:11.716 --> 02:04:13.843
- That's crazy, okay?
- Yeah.


1556
02:04:13.985 --> 02:04:17.512
You hit this cocksucker,
and you leave him in the street. Come on.


1557
02:05:20.585 --> 02:05:23.645
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.


1558
02:05:23.755 --> 02:05:26.781
I'm looking for something, all right?
I'll be right in.


1559
02:05:27.559 --> 02:05:30.187
That's not gonna work anymore.

1560
02:05:32.497 --> 02:05:33.521
Where is it?

1561
02:05:33.631 --> 02:05:35.963
There's $300,000 in that bag.

1562
02:05:37.602 --> 02:05:40.571
How do you know what's in that bag?

1563
02:05:41.339 --> 02:05:42.431
I counted it.

1564
02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.564
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1565
02:05:43.675 --> 02:05:45.302
- You counted it?
- Yeah.


1566
02:05:45.443 --> 02:05:48.241
What do you mean, you counted it?
It's none of your business.


1567
02:05:48.346 --> 02:05:51.782
Not my business? It's in my house.
Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?


1568
02:05:51.883 --> 02:05:53.851
I want that fucking bag, Maggie.

1569
02:05:53.985 --> 02:05:58.149
FBl men do not walk around
with $300,000 in a bag.


1570
02:05:58.823 --> 02:06:02.224
- Joe, you could go to jail for this.
- Shut the fuck up. Nobody's going to jail.


1571
02:06:02.327 --> 02:06:04.795
Did you think about your children
for a second?


1572
02:06:04.896 --> 02:06:07.456
- You have no idea what you're talking about.
- I don't?


1573
02:06:07.565 --> 02:06:10.329
- The bag belongs to somebody else.
- Does it? Who?


1574
02:06:10.635 --> 02:06:13.365
- Whose bag is it, Joe?
- One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.


1575
02:06:13.471 --> 02:06:17.498
- A fucked-up guy needs $300,000?
- Yeah, right. Where's the goddamn bag?


1576
02:06:19.377 --> 02:06:22.039
You're becoming like them, you know that?

1577
02:07:00.618 --> 02:07:03.951
Did you ever once ask yourself
how I make it through my days?


1578
02:07:04.756 --> 02:07:06.917
I pretend I'm a widow

1579
02:07:07.292 --> 02:07:10.386
with medals and scrapbooks and memories.

1580
02:07:12.664 --> 02:07:14.222
I pretend you're dead.

1581
02:07:14.632 --> 02:07:17.157
That's how my life makes sense to me.

1582
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:20.296
Just go away. Stay away.

1583
02:07:35.987 --> 02:07:39.184
God, why do you hate me
when I love you so much?


1584
02:07:45.163 --> 02:07:46.994
You think I hate you?

1585
02:07:48.166 --> 02:07:49.929
I don't hate you.

1586
02:07:56.374 --> 02:07:58.365
This job is eating me alive.

1587
02:07:59.310 --> 02:08:01.039
I can't breathe anymore.

1588
02:08:04.582 --> 02:08:06.914
And if I come
out, this guy Lefty dies.

1589
02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:12.817
They're gonna kill him,
because he vouched for me,


1590
02:08:12.924 --> 02:08:14.687
because he stood up for me.

1591
02:08:16.361 --> 02:08:18.192
I live with that every day.

1592
02:08:20.431 --> 02:08:23.525
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet
in his head myself, you understand?


1593
02:08:26.237 --> 02:08:28.865
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.


1594
02:08:28.973 --> 02:08:31.567
You know, the man
in the white fucking hat.

1595
02:08:32.443 --> 02:08:33.671
For what?

1596
02:08:36.647 --> 02:08:37.841
For nothing.

1597
02:08:43.054 --> 02:08:46.023
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie.
I am them.


1598
02:09:24.695 --> 02:09:26.629
Left? Donnie.

1599
02:09:26.731 --> 02:09:28.426
Donnie? Where you been?

1600
02:09:28.533 --> 02:09:30.364
Yeah, look...

1601
02:09:30.835 --> 02:09:33.531
- I gotta see you.
- You're right, you gotta see me.


1602
02:09:33.638 --> 02:09:35.629
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?


1603
02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:38.470
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.

1604
02:09:38.576 --> 02:09:41.136
- I'll pick you up.
- We don't have time, Donnie.


1605
02:09:41.245 --> 02:09:42.542
- You meet me there.
- Okay.


1606
02:10:06.704 --> 02:10:09.605
Bruno's here. He's down
the end of the pier.

1607
02:10:11.108 --> 02:10:14.043
We'll wait here a minute
while he has his drink.


1608
02:10:14.812 --> 02:10:17.042
Let him get a little sleepy.

1609
02:10:18.382 --> 02:10:21.840
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?


1610
02:10:22.553 --> 02:10:24.350
- The boat?
- Yeah.


1611
02:10:25.156 --> 02:10:26.453
Nice.

1612
02:10:27.425 --> 02:10:31.293
Forget about it. 
One thing I know is boats.

1613
02:10:31.863 --> 02:10:35.663
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water,
take the fucking boat.


1614
02:10:38.035 --> 02:10:42.563
Remember you said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again,


1615
02:10:43.274 --> 02:10:47.142
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette
and just go?


1616
02:10:47.345 --> 02:10:51.042
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody'd ever find you.


1617
02:10:51.148 --> 02:10:54.345
That was before.
Don't remind me about that now.


1618
02:10:54.485 --> 02:10:57.511
- Yeah, but I'm just saying...
- I don't want to think about that.


1619
02:10:57.622 --> 02:10:59.112
Did you mean it?

1620
02:11:00.224 --> 02:11:01.350
Mean it?

1621
02:11:01.726 --> 02:11:04.388
Who am I? Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?


1622
02:11:04.896 --> 02:11:07.330
- I'm saying, what if, Left?
- What if.


1623
02:11:07.465 --> 02:11:08.762
What if...

1624
02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:13.430
I mean, I got a couple of things
going on the side. A couple of jewel things.


1625
02:11:14.672 --> 02:11:17.470
Maybe I could get that kind of money
for you.


1626
02:11:20.411 --> 02:11:22.504
You're gonna find money
for me to get a boat?


1627
02:11:22.613 --> 02:11:24.979
- Maybe.
- Yeah?


1628
02:11:25.883 --> 02:11:28.147
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.

1629
02:11:28.252 --> 02:11:32.416
What if I could hand you
a bagful of money right now?


1630
02:11:33.691 --> 02:11:35.591
You know what I'm saying?

1631
02:11:37.562 --> 02:11:39.655
You could leave this life.

1632
02:11:40.164 --> 02:11:42.223
You said it yourself,
if you don't move up,

1633
02:11:42.333 --> 02:11:44.301
every day you're looking
over your shoulder.


1634
02:11:44.402 --> 02:11:45.767
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1635
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:47.497
- Donnie, listen to me.
- No more bullshit.


1636
02:11:47.605 --> 02:11:49.300
Get out of this life
is what I'm saying, Left.


1637
02:11:49.407 --> 02:11:51.932
- I'm gonna show you something, Donnie.
- What?


1638
02:11:52.043 --> 02:11:54.876
I want you to
look at it very carefully.

1639
02:11:56.113 --> 02:11:59.571
And then I want
you to think very carefully

1640
02:12:00.918 --> 02:12:03.250
about what you say to me.

1641
02:12:07.258 --> 02:12:09.556
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.

1642
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:22.464
- I really don't think that's the same boat...
- That's the same boat.


1643
02:12:22.573 --> 02:12:25.201
It's got the name on it, 
The Left Hand.

1644
02:12:25.309 --> 02:12:27.300
It's like my name.

1645
02:12:28.679 --> 02:12:30.943
That's that Abscam boat.

1646
02:12:33.017 --> 02:12:35.611
You think I knew
that was a Federal boat?

1647
02:12:37.188 --> 02:12:39.452
You think I'm a fucking rat?

1648
02:12:39.824 --> 02:12:43.316
How many times I have you
into my own house?


1649
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:47.559
Twice a week, at least. Why?

1650
02:12:47.665 --> 02:12:50.065
There it is, "At least. "

1651
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:53.832
- I cook for you.
- Yeah.


1652
02:12:55.072 --> 02:12:57.404
If ever I had
any money, I'd give you.

1653
02:12:58.242 --> 02:13:01.143
I never had any money. 
But if ever I had...

1654
02:13:01.245 --> 02:13:05.011
$100 in my pocket, 
I gave you $50, right?

1655
02:13:06.283 --> 02:13:08.808
- Yeah, you did.
- If you're a rat...


1656
02:13:19.797 --> 02:13:24.234
If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.


1657
02:13:25.036 --> 02:13:27.834
Even if this thing
is a Federal boat, Left,

1658
02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.841
they scam all these other people.
They didn't scam us.


1659
02:13:32.943 --> 02:13:34.740
You know what I'm saying?

1660
02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.748
We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.


1661
02:13:42.186 --> 02:13:45.417
How do you know
that we walked away from it?


1662
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:47.614
We're sitting here, right?

1663
02:13:48.359 --> 02:13:51.419
So they tried to outsmart us,
but we outsmarted them.


1664
02:13:53.097 --> 02:13:54.997
We beat the agents.

1665
02:13:58.936 --> 02:14:00.631
You gotta believe me.

1666
02:14:11.449 --> 02:14:12.609
Okay.

1667
02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:17.415
Let's go do this work.

1668
02:14:18.689 --> 02:14:20.657
Get this over with.

1669
02:14:26.931 --> 02:14:29.263
Two in back of the ear.
Like pushing a button.


1670
02:14:29.366 --> 02:14:30.890
Bing, bing. That's it.

1671
02:14:31.035 --> 02:14:32.730
- Yeah.
- Don't freeze up.


1672
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:34.997
- You gonna freeze up?
- No.


1673
02:14:35.106 --> 02:14:37.802
- A lot of guys freeze up.
- I'll be all right.


1674
02:14:37.908 --> 02:14:40.934
Did I say you was a rat?
I can't believe you brought that up.


1675
02:14:41.045 --> 02:14:42.808
Come on. Forget about it, Left.

1676
02:14:42.913 --> 02:14:45.177
I never said you was a rat.

1677
02:14:45.416 --> 02:14:46.974
I'm your best friend.

1678
02:14:49.253 --> 02:14:51.380
Come on. Let's go do this thing.

1679
02:15:32.296 --> 02:15:34.662
Come on, Donnie. Come on.

1680
02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.100
Gotta do it, Don.

1681
02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:41.697
Come on, Don.

1682
02:15:42.306 --> 02:15:43.364
Now!

1683
02:15:44.308 --> 02:15:46.037
Come on.

1684
02:15:47.478 --> 02:15:49.969
FBl! Freeze!

1685
02:15:51.248 --> 02:15:52.340
Shit!

1686
02:15:56.587 --> 02:15:59.556
Don't say nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing to them.


1687
02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.425
Don't tell them nothing, Donnie!

1688
02:16:04.528 --> 02:16:06.223
Donnie, don't say nothing!

1689
02:16:06.363 --> 02:16:10.060
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's not over. I'm not coming out.


1690
02:16:10.201 --> 02:16:13.864
There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours!
Donnie, you're all right!


1691
02:16:13.971 --> 02:16:15.734
- Shit!
- It's over, man!


1692
02:16:15.873 --> 02:16:18.239
Don't say nothing to them, Donnie!

1693
02:16:18.475 --> 02:16:20.375
It's over, Joe.

1694
02:17:02.519 --> 02:17:06.580
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco.
That's not his real name.


1695
02:17:08.692 --> 02:17:11.752
Truth is, he's been
an FBl agent all along.

1696
02:17:15.032 --> 02:17:18.365
You can contact me here
if you want to talk.

1697
02:18:08.452 --> 02:18:10.852
Can you believe those fucking guys?

1698
02:18:11.755 --> 02:18:13.848
There's no way Donnie's an agent.

1699
02:18:15.426 --> 02:18:17.587
It's a nice fucking bluff, huh?

1700
02:18:18.228 --> 02:18:21.061
That boat was a set-up.
They set the boat up.


1701
02:18:21.432 --> 02:18:23.593
See? Then we think Donnie's a rat.

1702
02:18:28.839 --> 02:18:31.239
Almost had me going,

1703
02:18:32.242 --> 02:18:33.937
if you didn't know Donnie.

1704
02:18:36.413 --> 02:18:38.574
Right, if I didn't know Donnie.

1705
02:19:01.672 --> 02:19:04.038
Hyenas kill many young cheetahs

1706
02:19:04.174 --> 02:19:08.008
and more than one could overpower
the mother and turn on the cubs.


1707
02:19:19.690 --> 02:19:20.816
Yeah?

1708
02:19:22.693 --> 02:19:24.490
Yeah. All right.

1709
02:19:25.896 --> 02:19:27.363
All right. Okay.

1710
02:19:35.406 --> 02:19:37.499
Was that for me?

1711
02:19:38.208 --> 02:19:42.167
No. It was a guy
I got to go see.

1712
02:19:42.613 --> 02:19:45.673
- So late?
- What am I gonna do?


1713
02:19:47.551 --> 02:19:49.178
Who knows with these people?

1714
02:19:49.286 --> 02:19:51.220
- Honey, don't wait up for me tonight.
- No?


1715
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:53.346
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

1716
02:19:53.457 --> 02:19:55.288
And listen to me.

1717
02:20:00.664 --> 02:20:02.564
If Donnie calls

1718
02:20:03.667 --> 02:20:05.225
tell him

1719
02:20:10.574 --> 02:20:12.735
if it was going to be anyone,

1720
02:20:14.111 --> 02:20:17.103
I'm glad it was him, all right?

1721
02:20:17.481 --> 02:20:19.449
Look how beautiful you look.

1722
02:20:19.983 --> 02:20:22.144
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.


1723
02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:11.491
Excuse me, Mrs. Pistone.

1724
02:22:12.296 --> 02:22:13.923
Have a seat.

1725
02:22:18.835 --> 02:22:22.032
- "To Special Agent Joseph... "
- Thirty seconds, sir.


1726
02:22:22.739 --> 02:22:27.335
"Joseph D. Pistone, in grateful recognition
for meritorious service. "


1727
02:22:27.511 --> 02:22:32.141
Allow me to present you with this medal
and this check for $500.


1728
02:22:32.249 --> 02:22:33.682
Hold the check up.

1729
02:22:34.751 --> 02:22:38.016
- Congratulations again, son.
- Congratulations, Joe.


1730
02:22:39.323 --> 02:22:42.349
- Ma'am, take good care of him.
- I will.


1731
02:22:42.726 --> 02:22:44.193
Mrs. Pistone.

1732
02:23:23.233 --> 02:23:24.791
It's over.

1733
02:23:26.503 --> 02:23:28.562
Come on, honey. Come home.
