Through the misty

I greet the dawn

For when its light
has hit the ground


7
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.970
There 's lots of treasures
to be found

of tomorrow never comes

But since you dreamed
the night away

I meant to go yesterday.

Very well.
Pickled herrings for breakfast

that I can do for you?

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.610
Is that your garden club?

148

No, it's the Society for

Yes.

153

Yes, but we also run
soup kitchens.


154
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.130
It's a never-ending job
these days, I'm afraid.

I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks.

Miss Banks, actually.
I'm Michael's sister.

My wife passed away
this last year.

Yes. Our deepest condolences.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.169
Thank you. Forgive me,

161
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.295
what brings the two of you
here this morning?


162
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.297
I'm going to say my goodbyes.
I'm late for work.


163
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.609
Mr. Banks, you took out a loan

164
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.894
with the
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank...


165
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.255
last year against the value
of your home.


166
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.569
You did what? Michael.

167
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.617
I had to, Jane.

168
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.089
With Kate and the bills piling
up, I really had no choice.


169
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.455
It's hard enough these days,
isn't it?


170
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.292
Yes. Well... Shh!

171
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.654
It seems you have fallen

172
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.254
three months behind
in your payments.


173
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.932
Oh. (SIGHS)

174
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.294
I'm so sorry.

175
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.497
Uh, Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.


176
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.134
And I've been
a bit off stride. Forgive me.


177
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.416
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?


178
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.088
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding


179
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.456
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.


180
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.494
The entire loan?

181
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.775
Yes. It's all in the contract.

182
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.578
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.


183
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.139
Oh, dear.

184
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.092
You have five days.

185
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.177
If you are unable
to pay in full


186
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.488
by Friday at midnight...

187
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.855
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...


188
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.369
and you will have to vacate
the premises.


189
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.853
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.


190
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.539
Not as an accountant,
I presume.


191
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.769
No, as a teller.

192
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.174
I took a part-time position
there this past year.


193
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.455
You see, I'm really an artist.

194
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.769
Yes, be that as it may.

195
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.250
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.


196
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.648
Father left us shares
in the bank.


197
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.298
You could use those
to pay off the loan.


198
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.654
I was saving those
for the children.


199
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.970
Shares? In the bank?

200
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.574
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?


201
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.777
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?


202
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.658
Ready and charged, sir.

203
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.219
Do you have
the share certificate?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.138
-l'm sorry, the what?
-FRYE: The document...


205
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.808
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.


206
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.012
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.


207
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.209
Yes, I suppose it must.

But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.617
On how to brush
our daughter's hair


315

needed explanations


316

just what to say

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.052
But not from this room

322
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.496
Snow's left the lane

323
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.051
But the cherry trees
forgot to bloom

to hold me

I can hear your voice

ﬁlls my day, dear

since you went away, dear

My question, Kate, is...

334
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.378
Where'd you go?

doing up here?

Oh. I wasn't
using them anymore.


341

get rid of it all.

can't remember why we kept

most of this stuff
to begin with.


345

I mean, why on earth did we
save this old broken thing?

of imagination.

-Yes, about your employment...


462
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.414
the truth is,
I simply can't afford...


463
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.979
We can settle on terms later,

464
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.209
although lwill want
my old room back.


465
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.092
That's if it's not
a complete disaster...


466

and lwill insist on having
every second Tuesday off.


467

-NO, I'm afraid, I...
-Of course, Mary Poppins.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.849

That's all settled.

quite nicely, thank you.

JACK: DO you know,
when l was a lad...


803
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.939
I used to wave up to the boy
and girl who lived here.

It's been ages

Well, she lives in a flat
on the other side of town now.

I'm sure you'll bump into her

it was priceless...

Once upon a time
in a nursery rhyme


1049
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.097
There was a castle
with a king hiding in a wing


1050
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.409
'Cause he never
went to school


1051
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.615
To learn a single thing

1052
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.736
He had scepters and swords
And a parliament of Lords


1053
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.777
But on the inside he was sad
Egad!


1054
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.817
Because he never had
a wisdom for numbers


1055
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:38.889
A wisdom for words

1056
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.095
Though his crown
was quite immense


1057
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.335
His brain was smaller
than a bird's


1058
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.536
So the queen of the nation
made a royal proclamation


1059
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.894
"To the missus
and the messers


1060
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.015
"The more or lessers

1061
00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.329
"Bring me
all the land's professors"


1062
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.569
Then she went
to the hair dressers


1063
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.890
And they came from the East
And they came from the South


1064
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.175
From each college,
they poured knowledge


1065
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.329
From their brains
into his mouth


1066
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.535
But the king
couldn 't learn


1067
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.689
So each professor
met their fate


1068
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.855
For the queen
had their heads removed


1069
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.929
And placed upon the gate

1070
00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.009
And on that date

1071
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.014
I state their wives
all got a note


1072
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.374
Their mate
was now the late great


1073
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.529
But then suddenly one day

1074
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.775
A stranger started
in to sing


1075
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.895
He said,
"I'm the dirty rascal


1076
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.015
"And I'm here
to teach the king! "


1077
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.215
And the queen
clutched her jewels


1078
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.449
For she hated royal fools

1079
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.735
But this fool
had some rules


1080
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:11.889
They really ought
to teach in schools


1081
00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.095
Like you'll be
a happy king


1082
00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.408
If you enjoy
the things you've got


1083
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.489
You should never try to be

1084
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.615
The kind of person
that you're not


1085
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.849
So they sang
and they laughed


1086
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.055
For the king
had found a friend


1087
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.728
And they ran onto a rainbow
for the story's perfect end


1088
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.891
So the moral is you mustn’t
let the outside be the guide


1089
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.095
For it's not so cut
and dried


1090
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.249
Well, unless
it's Doctor Jekyll


1091
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.329
Then you better hide

1092
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.409
Petriﬁed!

1093
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.899
No, the truth
can’t be denied


1094
00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.009
As I have now
have testiﬁed


1095
00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.898
All that really counts
and matters


1096
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.858
Is the special

Which way do we go,
Mary Poppins?


1720
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.653
MARY: Now,
why would you ask me?


1721
01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.811
The three of you are leading
the way, after all.


1722
01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.049
ANNABEL: Us?
JOHN: But we were...


1723
01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.858
Walking around in a fog.

1724
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.296
NO, we weren't. I mean,
we are in a fog, but...


1725
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:46.569
We were only talking.

1726
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.617
Yes, too focused
on where you've been


1727
01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.849
to pay attention
to where you're going.


1728
01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.453
But Father told us
to go straight home!


1729
01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:52.655
He'll be furious
if we're late.


1730
01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:55.015
Not much to be done
about that now, is there?


1731
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.699
Are we lost, then?

1732
01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.373
JACK: That would depend
on where you want to go.


1733
01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.449
CHILDREN: Jack!

1734
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.529
At your service.

1735
01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.656
Say, what's with
all the glum faces?


1736
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.651
Lost Sixpence
and found a penny?


1737
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:05.775
We've made a mess
of everything.


1738
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.849
Father's furious with us.

1739
01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.540
And we can't find
our way home.


1740
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.849
Lost?

1741
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.248
Are you, Mary Poppins?

1742
01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.579
Hopelessly.

1743
01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.571
Well, now, I'm no expert...

1744
01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.213
but if ever I lose my way,

1745
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.689
I just look for a little light
to guide me.


1746
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.653
(SINGING) Let's say
you're lost


1747
01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.208
In a park, sure

1748
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:34.413
You can give in
to the dark, or


1749
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.538
You can trip a little light
fantastic with me


1750
01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.131
When you're alone
in your room


1751
01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.292
Your choice is just
embrace the gloom


1752
01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:52.580
Or you can trip a little
light fantastic with me


1753
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.737
For if you hide
under the covers


1754
01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.289
You might
never see the day


1755
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.691
But if a spark can start
inside your heart


1756
01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:04.339
Then you can always
ﬁnd the way


1757
01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.260
So when life
is gettin’ dreary


1758
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.775
Just pretend
that you're a leerie


1759
01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:13.774
As you trip a little
light fantastic with me


1760
01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:14.975
What's a leerie?

1761
01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.449
Why, it's what we lamplighters
call ourselves, of course.


1762
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.971
Time to send up
the call to arms.


1763
01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.809
Leeries, trip the light
to lead the way!


1764
01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.693
Now, when you're stuck
in the mist, sure


1765
01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.930
You can struggle
and resist, or


1766
01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.410
You can trip a little
light fantastic with me


1767
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.739
Now, say you're lost
in the crowd, well


1768
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.970
You can stamp
and scream out loud, or


1769
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:43.530
You can trip a little
light fantastic with me


1770
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.772
And when the fog
comes rollin' in


1771
01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:48.534
Just keep your feet
upon the path


1772
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.134
Mustn't mope and frown
Or worse, lie down


1773
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.972
Don ’t let it be
your epitaph


1774
01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.415
So, when life
is gettin’ scary


1775
01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.536
Be your own illuminary

1776
01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.375
Who can shine their light
for all the world to see


1777
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.374

the world looks bright

a little light fantastic!

1793
01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.488

"Kick and prance," it means
"dance." It's leerie speak.

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.739
Where on earth
have you all been?


1874
01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.373
I told you to bring them
straight home.


1875
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.529
I've been worried sick!

1876
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.735
We're sorry
we're late, Father.


1877
01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.173
It wasn't Mary Poppins' fault.

1878
01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:57.699
We got lost in the fog.

1879
01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.693
Jack and the leeries led us
down the frog and toad.


1880
01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.452
He means road.

1881
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.372
So you've been off filling
the children's heads


1882
01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.495
with stuff and nonsense.

1883
01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.488
I've heard quite enough.
Come in at once!


1884
01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.934
Best to take my leave.
Good night, Mary Poppins.


1885
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.009
Good night, Jack.

1886
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.089
Into the parlor, go on.

1887
01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:14.809
Go on.

1888
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.090
Don't be too hard on 'em, sir.

1889
01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.932
They're only children,
after all.


1890
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.818
I know they're children,
my children,


1891
01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.379
and lwill deal with them
as I see fit.


1892
01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.298
-Now leave us to it.
-Yes, sir.


1893
01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.139
Not you, Mary Poppins.
In here.


1894
01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.249
Very well, sir.

1895
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.536
You could have lost me myjob.

1896
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.775
Do you understand that?

1897
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.653
Have you any idea
how difficult it is to find


1898
01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.458
a good position like mine
these days?


1899
01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.370
But there you all were,
tearing about like a...


1900
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.815
And you, Mary Poppins,

1901
01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.573
I thought you were here
to look after these children.


1902
01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:01.533
It wasn't her doing,
it was me.


1903
01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.492
No, it was us.

1904
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.295
We thought maybe
if we talked to Mr. Frye...


1905
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.212
he could give you more time
to save the house.


1906
01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.654
We were only trying to help.

1907
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.048
Well, you didn't help!

1908
01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.129
Now...

1909
01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.533
I know it's been a hard year
for our family...


1910
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.577
and I've done all I can...

1911
01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.970
to keep you all from worrying,
but I can't do this on my own.


1912
01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.653
It's too hard. I just...

1913
01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.299
I'm barely holding it together
as it is.


1914
01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.690
I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...


1915
01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.769
and there's no more time,

1916
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.009
we're about to lose
our home...


1917
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.375
and I can't lose this house.
I just can't.


1918
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:35.295
I don't know what to do.

1919
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.098
(VOICE BREAKS) I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.


1920
01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:43.534
Everything's fallen to pieces
since your mother... (CRYING)


1921
01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.688
Haven't we lost
enough already?


1922
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:04.011
We haven't lost Mother.

1923
01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.252
Not really.

1924
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:15.614
(SINGING) Nothing’s gone
forever, only out of place


1925
01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:22.575
So when we need her touch
and loving gaze


1926
01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:29.216
"Gone but not forgotten "
is the perfect phrase


1927
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:35.296
Smiling from a star
that she makes glow


1928
01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.051
Trust she's always there

1929
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.576
Watching as we grow

1930
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:45.095
Find her in the place

1931
01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:51.455
Where the lost things go

1932
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.011
When did you all
get so clever?


1933
01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.056
Last night,
Mary Poppins told us...


1934
01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:09.370
I hope I'm as clever as you
when I grow up.


1935
01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.056
(CHUCKLES) You're right.

1936
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.131
Of course, you're right,
Georgie.


1937
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.694
Your mother's not gone.
She's in your smile.

(CHUCKUNG)

1939
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.771
And in your walk, John...

1940
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.130
and Annabel's eyes.

1941
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.695
And she'll always be with us
wherever we go.


1942
01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.929
Love you.

1943
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.736
Now, run along, wash your
hands, get ready for dinner.


1944
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.449
Did you have something
to do with them


1945
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.529
trying to save the house?

1946
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.938
I never said a word.

1947
01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.897
It was
all the children's idea.


1948
01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.293
The whole time
I've been looking after them,


1949
01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.455
they've been looking after me.

1950
01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.973
I had it all backward.

1951
01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.858
A Banks family trait.

1952
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.852
What was I thinking?

1953
01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.893
Some people think
a great deal too much.


1954
01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.257
Of that I'm certain.

We can look through
everything again if you like.

No. No, there's no point.
It's nearly midnight.
