JAY: When I was a kid,
my mama had this dog.


4
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.153
It was a little poodle named
Sammy.


5
00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:35.689
He used to do all kind a tricks
like


6
00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.259
walk on his hind legs,
spin around in circles.


7
00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:40.593
You know, all that cute
little poodle shit.


8
00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:43.998
Then one day my mama was walking
him


9
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:47.101
and she ran into this pit
bull and it looked mean


10
00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:49.703
but she gave it the benefit of
the doubt.


11
00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:52.539
She put her hand out to pet
it and it growled at her.


12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.243
Well little Sammy,

13
00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:57.711
he wanted to protect her from
that pit.


14
00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:00.114
So he started barking
at it and that was all


15
00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:02.283
it took for that pit to put
little Sammy on his back,


16
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:04.617
wrap his jaw around his neck and
kill him.


17
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.257
Mama didn't do nothing about it.

18
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.492
She thought maybe it was Sammy's
fault.


19
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:15.895

passed.

The pit did the same thing
to her neighbor's cat


34

and then to the laundromat
owner's dog.

36
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.965
she never warned nobody about
pit.

472

Come here, girl.

473
00:30:19.773 --> 00:30:21.209
Piece of shit.

474
00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:33.386
Hey box boy,

475
00:30:34.788 --> 00:30:37.791
how about you show me what
they charge in prison?


476
00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:39.760
What are you doing here?

477
00:30:39.793 --> 00:30:40.660
You thirsty?

478
00:30:41.661 --> 00:30:42.496
PETE: So a guy gets beat

479
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:44.731
to death with brass knuckles, so
what?


480
00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:48.502
So what? Nobody uses brass
knuckles.


481
00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:51.538
Well, almost nobody.

482
00:30:51.571 --> 00:30:53.406
It doesn't mean it's the same
guy.


483
00:30:55.408 --> 00:30:56.376
I don't believe this.

484
00:30:56.409 --> 00:30:58.045
If I gave you this
information six years ago,


485
00:30:58.079 --> 00:30:59.913
you would've gone batshit crazy.

486
00:30:59.947 --> 00:31:02.582
Yeah well, two years in
prison will do that to do.


487
00:31:02.616 --> 00:31:03.650
Do what?

488
00:31:03.683 --> 00:31:05.019
Make you think twice about
doing


489
00:31:05.052 --> 00:31:08.055
something stupid, like listening
to you.


490
00:31:09.957 --> 00:31:11.892
That's not the only
thing you did in prison.


491
00:31:12.793 --> 00:31:14.861
You hit that commissary every
night, huh?


492

last meal every fucking night?

498

Do you want to know what
the highlight of my day is?


499
00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:32.913
I wake up every morning and I
don't get


500
00:31:32.947 --> 00:31:35.448
a blow job from my wife and I
usually take


501
00:31:35.482 --> 00:31:38.485
a shit about the size of
the Transamerica Pyramid.


502
00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:42.422
But the highlight of my day
is I go down to my local


503
00:31:42.455 --> 00:31:46.693
Starbucks and I watch my
favorite barista frappe my 'cino


504
00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:50.897
and when she's doing it, I
just grab a little glimpse


505
00:31:51.798 --> 00:31:55.502
of her perfect apple ass
and then everything else


506
00:31:55.535 --> 00:31:58.805
goes downhill from there
because that's what fucking


507
00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:01.741
happens when they give you
early fucking retirement.


508
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.579
I gotta tell ya, Pete,

509
00:32:05.612 --> 00:32:08.615
there's not a day that
goes by that I don't think


510
00:32:08.648 --> 00:32:11.451
I wonder if this is the
day I'm gonna take my Glock


511
00:32:11.484 --> 00:32:13.753
and blow my fucking
brains out from boredom.


512

Jack, what are you doing here?

513
00:32:18.025 --> 00:32:20.094
Obviously I don't have
any money to give you.


514
00:32:20.127 --> 00:32:22.063
I mean you're wasting your time.

516
00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:26.499
Pete, if I wanted money, I
wouldn't be


517

looking for clients next
to a dumpster, no offense.

Ross' known associates.

his head bashed in with


524

brass knuckles, now maybe
the murder was personal.


525

list is your guy, Pete.

years later?

deserves the death penalty

into a coma for a couple days.

541

Five days, Jack.

you want to go ahead and tell
