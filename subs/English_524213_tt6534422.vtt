00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.807
<i>Now, I'm sure you've
heard of the amazing author</i>


2
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.842
<i>Mitch Stockridge.</i>

3
00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.394
<i>So, how does he do it?</i>

4
00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.945
<i>How does he come up
with these original ideas,</i>


5
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:21.313
<i>you guys are wondering.</i>

6
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.348
<i>Some argue his books
have saved lives.</i>


7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.583
<i>So, join us next week</i>

8
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.019
<i>for a documentary
on his amazing life.</i>


9
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.487
<i>I'm a really big fan,</i>

10
00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:30.608
<i>so I'm gonna tell you now
you won't be disappointed.</i>


11
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.765
<i>Success...</i>

12
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.469
<i>it isn't what most
people think it is.</i>


13
00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:20.706
<i>It's a long and dark road</i>

14
00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:23.809
<i>and probably leave
many messes behind,</i>


15
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.378
<i>and if you're not careful,</i>

16
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.846
<i>you don't clean up
after yourself,</i>


17
00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.915
<i>those messes can come
back to haunt you.</i>


18
00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:52.157
Ms. Dettler, I'm John Logan.

19
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.725
We spoke on the phone.

20
00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:56.928
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

21
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.563
No problem.

22
00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:00.098
Just ready to tell my story.

23
00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:02.033
Right.

24
00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:05.804
People need to know
who the real Mitch is.


25
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.212
Proceed.

26
00:04:16.984 --> 00:04:19.784
Well, for six months

27
00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.654
I was in a relationship
with Mitch Stockridge.


28
00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:26.558
Wait, the... the author?

29
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.577
Yes, the author.

30
00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:30.595
I keep a copy of<i>How to be</i>
<i>a Better Me</i> on my desk.


31
00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:34.533
Why? I'm a fan. 
I'm a big fan.

32
00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:35.734
I don't know how
the guy does it,


33
00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:38.570
comes up with all
these original ideas.


34
00:04:38.572 --> 00:04:40.639
If it wasn't for his
books on positivity,


35
00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:43.608
I wouldn't be the detective
I am today. Just saying.


36
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.245
Mitch is a monster and a
brilliant liar at that.


37
00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:52.551
How? The guy helps
thousands of people.


38
00:04:52.553 --> 00:04:53.553
He's done things...

39
00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:57.022
terrible things to others,

40
00:04:58.158 --> 00:05:00.559
even terrible things to me.

41
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:02.661
Alright, can you be
more specific?


42
00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:04.996
Look, I don't want
to be an accomplice


43
00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:07.999
or withhold valuable information
from the cops, you know.


44
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:09.968
You said you were his ex, right?

45
00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:12.304
Yeah.

46
00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:14.706
Look, it's not for nothing.

47
00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:16.641
We get ex-girlfriends
in here all the time,


48
00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:18.243
say something like it
and back out.


49
00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:21.613
What are we talking
about here, huh?


50
00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:25.183
Domestic dispute? Abuse? What?

51
00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:26.618
It was abuse.

52
00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:29.721
Not the textbook kind though.

53
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:35.193
Mitch was bullied
in school, I mean,


54
00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:36.761
he was bullied quite a bit.

55
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.967
The worst was a childhood
bully named Luke Rousseau.


56
00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:54.679
♫♫♫

57
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:15.967
From where do I know that name?

58
00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:18.737
Currently he's a missing person.

59
00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:22.675
And he told you this?

60
00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:25.210
You guys still talk?

61
00:06:26.813 --> 00:06:29.247
Well, we still talk
from time to time.


62
00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:32.685
He trusts me.

63
00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:37.956
But Mitch isn't the
most forgiving person.


64
00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.369
He holds grudges.

65
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.781
But do you think he would have...

66
00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:42.193
Okay, everything you
need to know about Mitch


67
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:44.062
goes back to his childhood.

68
00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:45.964
And I know that sounds
like shrink talk


69
00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:47.265
but it's really all there.

70
00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.935
He was always
closer to his mother.


71
00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:53.204
<i>Talked about her a lot.</i>

72
00:06:56.777 --> 00:06:59.911
♫♫♫

73
00:07:14.127 --> 00:07:17.829
I got a mom, I get it.
It's a motherhood thing.


74
00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:19.931
Right.

75
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.267
Go on, Sophie.

76
00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.937
His dying father lives
in that house with him,


77
00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.772
sealed away like some secret.

78
00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:30.275
I wasn't even allowed
to go into certain rooms


79
00:07:30.277 --> 00:07:31.342
on the second floor.

80
00:07:31.344 --> 00:07:35.380
The funny thing is Mitch
and his dad barely spoke.


81
00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:36.948
<i>He said it was his mom</i>

82
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.117
<i>who always cheered on
his writing and stuff.</i>


83
00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.721
<i>His dad was the more "it's
not a real job" kind of guy.</i>


84
00:07:46.893 --> 00:07:48.226
It's garbage.

85
00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:53.465
Mitch and Carver
didn't really get along,


86
00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.100
and I know that's classic

87
00:07:55.102 --> 00:07:57.469
and you hear that from
half the scum you drag in,


88
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:00.939
"It's not my fault. Daddy didn't
love me. Blah blah blah."


89
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:02.273
<i>Yeah, but come on.</i>

90
00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:05.944
<i>I mean, Mitch prove
the old man wrong to me.</i>


91
00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:07.378
<i>He's been pretty successful.</i>

92
00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:15.220
I don't think success
changed Mitch.


93
00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:18.356
I think he's been who he is
for much longer than that.


94
00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:19.758
All right. Look, whatever.

95
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.193
But is there anybody
this guy likes?


96
00:08:24.164 --> 00:08:25.164
Well...

97
00:08:28.168 --> 00:08:30.902
Okay, Mitch, you're
driving me crazy, man.


98
00:08:30.904 --> 00:08:32.437
It's late after work,
you dragged me out here


99
00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:34.272
'cause you have something
important to tell me


100
00:08:34.274 --> 00:08:36.040
and I should be at home
right now with Laura


101
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.509
watching<i>Stranger Things.</i>

102
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:39.244
- Final layouts due in a week.
- And?


103
00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:40.445
All I need is an ending.

104
00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:43.014
That's all you need, an ending.

105
00:08:43.016 --> 00:08:44.949
That's it. Well, that should
be so easy for you, Mitch.


106
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:47.252
But the reason I have summoned
you my friend, Nick,


107
00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:49.487
is for something
much, much greater.


108
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:52.490
Are you proposing to Sophie?

109
00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:55.527
You are, dude. I knew
it was gonna happen...


110
00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:57.562
Laura said, "He wants to be
single his whole life,


111
00:08:57.564 --> 00:08:58.980
he's a single guy."

112
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.397
I said, "No, I know Mitch,
he's gonna settle down."


113
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.433
And I knew it was coming.
I knew you were gonna do it.


114
00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:05.003
Actually, Sophie and I
are not a thing anymore.


115
00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:06.437
I feel like a giant asshole now.

116
00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:08.439
- That's because you are.
- Yeah.


117
00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:10.074
God.

118
00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:11.543
I'm sorry man. You okay?

119
00:09:11.545 --> 00:09:13.178
Yeah, I'm fine.
It ran its course.


120
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.546
We still talk sometimes.

121
00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:18.817
Anyways, check this out.

122
00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:26.191
Luke Rousseau.
The Luke Rousseau wrote you?


123
00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:27.926
Can that guy even write?

124
00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:29.527
Who hand writes letters anyways?

125
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.330
What does it say?

126
00:09:32.432 --> 00:09:34.399
- It's an apology.
- Well...


127
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.401
- Better late than never, right?
- I guess.


128
00:09:36.403 --> 00:09:37.569
So you know about the letter?

129
00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:39.304
Wait, how do you know
about the letter?


130
00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:42.006
His family mentioned it
in the missing-persons report.


131
00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:44.142
- Do you have that letter?
- No.


132
00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:47.245
I'm just going to do with one
of the Cuban sandwiches.


133
00:09:47.247 --> 00:09:48.346
Sure.

134
00:09:48.348 --> 00:09:50.915
- <i>Pollo frito.</i>
- Excellent choice.


135
00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:52.917
Is this separate or together?

136
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:53.885
- Together.
- Separate.


137
00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:55.386
- Mitch, don't...
- I got it.


138
00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:56.955
Stubborn.

139
00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:59.357
- Mitch Stockridge?
- In the flesh.


140
00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:00.391
I thought it was you.

141
00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:01.893
Oh, God, here we go.

142
00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:03.361
I love all your books.

143
00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:06.397
I read your<i>Life is Beautiful</i>
cover to cover twice


144
00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.599
the week that it came out.

145
00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:11.236
Just... really helped
with my depression.


146
00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:14.606
Oh, sorry, TMI.

147
00:10:14.607 --> 00:10:16.908
It's okay, I... it's very kind.
I like hearing those stories.


148
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.109
Are you working on anything new?

149
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:22.180
Oh, always.
I have a desk full of things,


150
00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:24.148
working on my newest collection

151
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.885
and hoping to have my first
novel done soon as well.


152
00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.186
Wow!

153
00:10:28.188 --> 00:10:31.055
Well, I will have
to pick those up


154
00:10:31.057 --> 00:10:32.891
but I'll take care
of this for you, guys.


155
00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:35.493
<i>Whatever happened to the dad?</i>

156
00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:39.097
He lives with him in his house.

157
00:10:39.099 --> 00:10:40.431
Mitch also works from home.

158
00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:55.346
Hey, dad, how are
you holding on?


159
00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:58.016
Yeah.

160
00:10:58.018 --> 00:10:59.018
That good, huh?

161
00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:00.986
What are you reading?

162
00:11:05.225 --> 00:11:07.325
You know that author and I
used to have the same agent.


163
00:11:07.327 --> 00:11:08.593
You know this guy?

164
00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.497
Well, that's a shame
I used to like him.


165
00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:16.367
We're not always on the
best sellers' list together


166
00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:17.502
but he's a great writer.

167
00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:35.520
- Luke, come on in.
- Hi, Mitch.


168
00:11:35.522 --> 00:11:37.255
<i>So Luke did come by.</i>

169
00:11:37.257 --> 00:11:39.057
<i>Yeah, Mitch told me.</i>

170
00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:41.326
Luke the childhood bully?

171
00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:44.228
Yes, John, try and keep up.
Don't interrupt.


172
00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:46.131
Were you there for this?

173
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.566
No.

174
00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:49.568
There you go.

175
00:11:50.537 --> 00:11:52.370
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

176
00:11:52.372 --> 00:11:54.539
Water, please.

177
00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:56.574
- H2O coming right up.
- Thank you.


178
00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:04.015
Make yourself at home.
<i>Mi casa su casa.</i>


179
00:12:04.017 --> 00:12:05.583
Okay, okay.

180
00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:09.187
- It's sweet place, man.
- Thank you.


181
00:12:09.189 --> 00:12:10.521
It's just you?

182
00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:12.090
It's me and dad.
I take care of him.


183
00:12:12.092 --> 00:12:13.758
He's a salty old fucker
but he's family, right?


184
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.562
Yeah. For sure.

185
00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:24.302
I'm really surprised you called
me after that last letter.


186
00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:28.539
You know, I was such a prick.

187
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.475
You know, I thought
you'd still be mad at me.


188
00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:33.144
Kids will be kids, right?

189
00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:35.179
Right. Right.

190
00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:39.050
- I appreciate that, Mitch.
- We all change.


191
00:12:39.052 --> 00:12:40.618
- I appreciate you reaching out.
- Yeah.


192
00:12:42.055 --> 00:12:44.622
Well, I read the last
bunch of your stories


193
00:12:44.624 --> 00:12:46.657
and it's interesting stuff, man.

194
00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:47.759
Any favorites?

195
00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:49.561
Yeah.

196
00:12:50.663 --> 00:12:52.263
The one about forgiveness.

197
00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:55.767
Chapter seven.

198
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.470
It's literally calling
I forgive you Luke.


199
00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:01.573
And...

200
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:15.653
Well, it's a great book, Mitch.

201
00:13:15.655 --> 00:13:19.123
Thank you. I like to write
about the human emotions


202
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:22.093
and I think forgiveness is
a very important part of that.


203
00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:25.596
Yeah, yeah it is.

204
00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:29.233
Well, you did it, right?

205
00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:31.803
Look at you now. 
Famous writer.

206
00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:33.538
Not yet. Baby steps.

207
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.741
Oh, you did it!
Stop being modest.


208
00:13:36.743 --> 00:13:39.444
And your mom would
be very proud of you.


209
00:13:39.446 --> 00:13:41.312
Thanks. I appreciate that.

210
00:13:41.314 --> 00:13:44.215
You never really feel
like "I did it though."


211
00:13:44.217 --> 00:13:45.817
It's never really done.

212
00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:48.186
What is doing it anyways, right?

213
00:13:48.188 --> 00:13:50.421
It's like there's always
the next one, and the next one


214
00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:52.824
and then somehow you
got to find the inspiration


215
00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:53.825
to do it all again.

216
00:13:53.827 --> 00:13:56.527
I feel like people
don't really understand


217
00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:59.397
the real sacrifice
for true success.


218
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.701
Hey, beats working
in construction, right?


219
00:14:03.703 --> 00:14:05.169
Can I show you something?

220
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440
Yeah.

221
00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:10.209
Follow me.

222
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:39.504
You are gonna love this.

223
00:14:39.506 --> 00:14:41.405
Yeah. The man cave?

224
00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:42.540
Something like that.

225
00:14:43.343 --> 00:14:44.709
Awesome.

226
00:14:49.883 --> 00:14:52.350
What in the fuck, man.

227
00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:54.519
- You helped me create it.
- What the fuck is that?


228
00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:34.258
Very inspirational, Luke.

229
00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:40.431
Can I interrupt now?

230
00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:41.732
Proceed, Detective.

231
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:44.802
What kind of drugs are you on?

232
00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:46.938
I didn't believe it
at first either.


233
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.872
Who would?

234
00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:49.540
Let me get this straight.

235
00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:52.510
- What exactly happened to Luke?
- I just told...


236
00:15:52.512 --> 00:15:54.345
You're accusing Mitch of...

237
00:15:54.347 --> 00:15:58.349
It gives him his stories,
all of his original ideas.


238
00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:01.369
What?

239
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.388
Mitch feeds it people and
it gives him his story ideas.


240
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.557
Okay, I think we're done here.

241
00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.825
Why don't we take a break?

242
00:16:07.827 --> 00:16:10.361
Good idea. Let's take a break.

243
00:16:10.363 --> 00:16:12.663
One more thing,
just hear me out.


244
00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.234
You should really consider
becoming an author.


245
00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:18.836
You... no, you're good,
you're really good.


246
00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:19.904
Just saying.

247
00:16:30.516 --> 00:16:31.916
Don't tell me you're
buying this crap.


248
00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:33.718
I'm not yet. I'm listening.

249
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.887
We're not supposed
to support crazy.


250
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:40.825
- Maybe she isn't crazy.
- What? Come on.


251
00:16:40.827 --> 00:16:42.377
Ignore the story.

252
00:16:42.378 --> 00:16:43.928
That's just something
her boyfriend is saying


253
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.996
to mess with her head.

254
00:16:46.382 --> 00:16:47.765
Sounds like something
out of a book, right?


255
00:16:47.767 --> 00:16:49.700
Yeah, go back to the part
about ignoring the story.


256
00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:51.535
That part I can do,
not a problem.


257
00:16:51.537 --> 00:16:53.004
Look at the facts, all right.

258
00:16:53.006 --> 00:16:55.773
This is our first lead
on Luke Rousseau.


259
00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:58.843
We have plenty of missing people
out there with no leads at all.


260
00:16:58.845 --> 00:17:01.779
- If Stockridge has motive here...
- Stockridge?


261
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:03.481
You guys talking
about Mitch Stockridge?


262
00:17:03.483 --> 00:17:07.785
We got missing people, yeah.
Transient, sex workers.


263
00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:11.022
You think Stockridge is out
there feeding them to something?


264
00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:12.924
Of course, not.

265
00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:14.825
But if he thinks he is that's
enough to keep him going.


266
00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:16.827
You know these artistic types.
They're all a little...


267
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.730
Yeah, I wouldn't kill somebody
to write a fucking book.


268
00:17:19.732 --> 00:17:21.599
Mitch is a rising star.

269
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.067
Maybe he is a star.

270
00:17:23.068 --> 00:17:24.534
He could be famous
worldwide one day.


271
00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:25.903
That could be worth it to some.

272
00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:28.306
How? Why?

273
00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:31.676
Mitch writes inspirational
books, your self-help shit.


274
00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:34.229
Doesn't make sense
he's killing people.


275
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.781
Just because his books help some
doesn't mean they help everyone.


276
00:17:36.783 --> 00:17:38.716
What does that even mean?

277
00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:39.684
Forget about it.

278
00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:40.686
Yeah.

279
00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:46.891
Look, I know you need this case,
especially after your last case.


280
00:17:48.728 --> 00:17:51.362
But please don't...
Don't go overboard on this.


281
00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:54.465
I cannot believe you
just brought that up.


282
00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:55.900
Sorry.

283
00:17:55.902 --> 00:17:57.702
There's more to this, John.

284
00:17:57.704 --> 00:18:01.739
Yeah, scorned ex-lover blows
whistle on monster ex-boyfriend.


285
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:03.107
How original?

286
00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:05.576
- I'm taking this on.
- Knock yourself out.


287
00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:09.547
Still love his books though.

288
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:10.549
Me, too.

289
00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:15.921
Thank you.

290
00:18:19.992 --> 00:18:21.525
Where's Detective Logan?

291
00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:24.762
My counterpart and I don't
see eye to eye on this one.


292
00:18:24.764 --> 00:18:25.764
I noticed.

293
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:29.533
I take it you were the good cop.

294
00:18:29.535 --> 00:18:30.535
Abby Dunn.

295
00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:34.839
I believe you.

296
00:18:34.841 --> 00:18:35.873
Really?

297
00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:37.041
Yes, actually.

298
00:18:39.795 --> 00:18:42.546
Good. He's beginning
to think I was going crazy.


299
00:18:42.548 --> 00:18:44.849
Sophie, being a cop in this area

300
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:47.017
means I see a lot of rich
and powerful people


301
00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:48.719
get away with things
they shouldn't.


302
00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:50.855
That concerns me.

303
00:18:50.857 --> 00:18:55.059
Hearing someone out on a story
doesn't concern me at all.


304
00:18:56.596 --> 00:18:57.596
Thank you.

305
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:03.134
So, how long has Mitch been
working and getting his ideas


306
00:19:03.136 --> 00:19:05.436
from this thing from the room?

307
00:19:06.472 --> 00:19:08.406
I have no idea.

308
00:19:08.408 --> 00:19:10.074
He's good at covering
his tracks.


309
00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:36.700
<i>How can he do it all by himself?</i>

310
00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:37.835
<i>I really don't know.</i>

311
00:19:38.704 --> 00:19:40.671
<i>I know he has a driver
that's mute.</i>


312
00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:43.174
<i>That's the only person
that occasionally helps him.</i>


313
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:48.546
Well, if you think of anything,
please let me know.


314
00:19:48.548 --> 00:19:50.448
I did the right thing, right?

315
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.582
Absolutely.

316
00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:07.531
<i>Mitch Stockridge,
you might have heard of him,</i>


317
00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:08.899
<i>but this local celebrity</i>

318
00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:11.469
<i>has been releasing
life-changing self-help books</i>


319
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:14.071
<i>and his latest release
is even more compelling.</i>


320
00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:16.607
<i>His original ideas
are captivating</i>


321
00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:18.509
<i>and even more so inspiring.</i>

322
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:22.847
<i>I myself had a hard time
putting down his new book.</i>


323
00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:25.216
Of course, now to
bring out the topic


324
00:20:25.218 --> 00:20:28.953
of your newest collection
<i>All Is Forgiven.</i>


325
00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:30.888
Already flying off the shelves.

326
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.625
I gotta say, Mitch,
this one is fantastic.


327
00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:38.229
Thank you. I'm trying, I guess.

328
00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:40.164
Well, tell us a little
about the book,


329
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.867
you know, without giving
away the ending, of course.


330
00:20:44.136 --> 00:20:47.271
Well, this time it's a
series of connected stories


331
00:20:47.273 --> 00:20:50.140
dealing with redemption
and the lengths


332
00:20:50.142 --> 00:20:54.178
that our main characters
are willing to go to to get it


333
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.714
with a few twists
and turns, of course.


334
00:20:56.716 --> 00:21:00.117
Well, we all know and love
the Stockridge voice.


335
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.804
But over the years,

336
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.689
your writing has gotten way
more creative and inventive.


337
00:21:07.627 --> 00:21:08.659
What's your secret?

338
00:21:09.729 --> 00:21:10.729
Who's your muse?

339
00:21:11.564 --> 00:21:12.630
No muse.

340
00:21:13.566 --> 00:21:15.733
Well, you're just on fire.

341
00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:18.869
The book is called
<i>All Is Forgiven</i>


342
00:21:18.871 --> 00:21:20.938
and you should buy
a copy right now.


343
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:23.707
Mitch, thank you.

344
00:21:46.065 --> 00:21:49.166
Are you seeing this, Mitch?
The line is out the door.


345
00:21:49.168 --> 00:21:51.602
It's my hometown crowd,
what do you expect?


346
00:21:51.604 --> 00:21:54.238
Imagine what it'd be like
if we were in New York.


347
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.773
You know I can't leave town.

348
00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:57.107
Oh, yeah, whatever, Mitch.

349
00:21:57.109 --> 00:21:58.642
As long as you keep up
the good work


350
00:21:58.644 --> 00:22:01.178
and, more importantly,
the sales, what do I care.


351
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.013
And you thought I wouldn't
make the deadline.


352
00:22:03.015 --> 00:22:05.616
And you did
with three hours to spare.


353
00:22:05.618 --> 00:22:06.951
Don't let me stop you.

354
00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:08.586
- Look at that shirt.
- Yeah.


355
00:22:09.622 --> 00:22:12.323
- And who do I make that to?
- Yeah, Amelia, please.


356
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.660
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.


357
00:22:16.662 --> 00:22:19.330
If you don't mind,
I've got a quick question.


358
00:22:19.332 --> 00:22:21.616
Okay.

359
00:22:21.617 --> 00:22:23.901
I was wondering, where
do you get your ideas from?


360
00:22:23.903 --> 00:22:25.903
They're just so original!

361
00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:27.905
I get them from things
that happened to me,


362
00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:30.124
things in my life.

363
00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:32.342
Yeah, but is there a process?
Does someone help you?


364
00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:33.345
No.

365
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.280
Then where?

366
00:22:37.216 --> 00:22:39.016
I don't steal them,
if that's what you're asking.


367
00:22:39.018 --> 00:22:40.818
- Can you get her mother...?
- Mitch.


368
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.086
You're arguing
with a little girl.


369
00:22:42.088 --> 00:22:43.120
I'm fourteen.

370
00:22:43.122 --> 00:22:44.688
She's accusing me of plagiarism.

371
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.290
What does that even mean?

372
00:22:46.292 --> 00:22:47.725
Have you lost your mind?

373
00:22:47.727 --> 00:22:49.059
Come on sweet, let's go.

374
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:51.128
Good luck marrying her off.

375
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.796
Asshole.

376
00:22:52.798 --> 00:22:54.865
- Am I the asshole?
- The line, Mitch.


377
00:22:55.835 --> 00:22:57.101
- Hi.
- Who do I make that to?


378
00:22:57.103 --> 00:22:58.302
- Bailey.
- Bailey.


379
00:23:00.006 --> 00:23:01.905
- Thank you.
- Next.


380
00:23:04.243 --> 00:23:05.376
Thank you.

381
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.392
Pops, I just made soup.

382
00:23:23.062 --> 00:23:25.295
Hope you cook better
than your write.


383
00:23:25.297 --> 00:23:27.097
It's the joy of my day
to come up here


384
00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:29.099
and pump you full of soup

385
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.100
after I've had a book
signing for a hundred fans.


386
00:23:31.103 --> 00:23:33.971
- Those keep me humble.
- A hundred fans, huh?


387
00:23:33.973 --> 00:23:36.173
Want to keep the
mortgage up on this pile.


388
00:23:36.175 --> 00:23:37.775
You even read the new one yet?

389
00:23:37.777 --> 00:23:39.977
- I flipped through.
- And?


390
00:23:39.979 --> 00:23:41.412
Come on Mitch,

391
00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:44.048
you've been writing the
same stupid self-help books


392
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.683
over and over since
you were in college.


393
00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:47.051
Newsweek said the same thing.

394
00:23:47.053 --> 00:23:49.186
But I think they
meant it in a good way.


395
00:23:49.188 --> 00:23:51.121
What was your big plan
for me anyways growing up?


396
00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:52.256
Being a doctor?

397
00:23:52.258 --> 00:23:54.124
I'd still be paying off loans.

398
00:23:56.028 --> 00:23:59.029
Well, I would have been proud
of a son if he was a doctor.


399
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.900
But I guess my dreams
will never come true.


400
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.704
Anyway, it's good honest work.

401
00:24:08.174 --> 00:24:11.008
Sometimes people ask me
where I get my ideas from.


402
00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:15.279
I tell them from
forgiving my father.


403
00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:17.448
You're always a little bitch.

404
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.188
Turns out you do cook
better than you write.


405
00:24:26.325 --> 00:24:28.258
It's still shit though.

406
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.860
Yeah, you are what you eat.

407
00:24:38.104 --> 00:24:40.804
Who is the one little bitch now?

408
00:24:40.806 --> 00:24:42.372
Shut the fuck up.

409
00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:55.753
So congrats again
on the signing, man.


410
00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:58.388
Thanks. And you
weren't there why?


411
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.091
Mitch, this is the third time
I'm telling you this,


412
00:25:01.093 --> 00:25:02.826
and I know you're
super butthurt about it,


413
00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:05.195
but the line to get
to you is a mile off.


414
00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:07.214
You're a mile tall,

415
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:09.232
you could have pushed your way
to the front as my bodyguard.


416
00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:10.934
Yeah, as true
as that might be Mitch,


417
00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:13.003
there's no way
I'm getting through


418
00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:15.071
literally four hundred crazed
estrogen-fueled women


419
00:25:15.074 --> 00:25:16.173
trying to get to you.

420
00:25:18.177 --> 00:25:20.377
God, so how many
is this for you now?


421
00:25:20.379 --> 00:25:21.379
Women?

422
00:25:22.148 --> 00:25:23.313
Or you even kept count?

423
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.816
No, books.

424
00:25:25.818 --> 00:25:27.050
- Too many to count.
- Yeah?


425
00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:31.789
- Did Luke end up showing up?
- Luke didn't come here.


426
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:34.057
No, I didn't ask
if Luke came here.


427
00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:35.926
I mean, did he go
to the signing?


428
00:25:35.928 --> 00:25:39.163
Oh... Uh... I really didn't...

429
00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:43.000
He didn't show up.

430
00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:45.903
It's no big deal. I mean...

431
00:25:45.905 --> 00:25:47.938
I guess you could hand him
a copy of your book and say,


432
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.908
"Luke, all is forgiven."

433
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.097
It's a joke.

434
00:25:56.098 --> 00:25:58.015
Mitch, just give me something.
Courtesy laugh even.


435
00:25:58.017 --> 00:26:00.284
- Hearty ha ha.
- I'll take it. Jesus.


436
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:03.220
Did you even read it?

437
00:26:03.222 --> 00:26:06.356
Yeah, of course, I read it.
It was nice. I liked it.


438
00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:07.858
It was "nice"?

439
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.961
Yeah, man, I mean, you're
the English major here, okay?


440
00:26:10.963 --> 00:26:13.864
I'm an IT guy. I see
things in black and white.


441
00:26:13.866 --> 00:26:16.867
I liked the book. So, I don't
have a more colorful vocabulary.


442
00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:18.101
It's gonna have to be enough.

443
00:26:20.573 --> 00:26:21.839
Did you um...

444
00:26:24.109 --> 00:26:26.109
Did you catch that piece
on you and the locals?


445
00:26:27.213 --> 00:26:29.079
I probably skimmed it.

446
00:26:30.449 --> 00:26:32.583
Yeah, it was super interesting.

447
00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:34.618
The... the reporter, she asked
you one of those, you know,


448
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.920
"Where do you draw your
inspiration from" questions.


449
00:26:36.922 --> 00:26:39.489
You would know,
you were there, right?


450
00:26:39.491 --> 00:26:41.491
And if I remember correctly,

451
00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:44.628
you told her that you have
a never-ending supply


452
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.232
of anger that you draw
from for your stories.


453
00:26:50.236 --> 00:26:50.935
Yeah.

454
00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:51.635
Okay, well, it's new news to me

455
00:26:51.637 --> 00:26:54.471
since I've known
you for forever.


456
00:26:54.473 --> 00:26:57.608
So, would you like to
elaborate a little more on it?


457
00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.610
It's like a...

458
00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:03.280
It's like a permanent
battery backup of anger.


459
00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:06.577
I write these books more
for myself than anything.


460
00:27:07.953 --> 00:27:10.020
Inadvertently it just
helps other people.


461
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.258
Maybe one day I can
actually help myself.


462
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.628
So, a permanent
battery backup of anger


463
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.932
sounds way worse than
I thought to be honest.


464
00:27:22.668 --> 00:27:25.636
And I didn't want to
call you out on this,


465
00:27:25.638 --> 00:27:30.007
but do you think that's
the right choice to be taking?


466
00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:34.111
I mean, if you ever want to have
any peace or joy in your life?


467
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.181
And this is why I make
more money than you make.


468
00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:43.086
Wow. Thanks, asshole.

469
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:47.090
That's Laura. Hold on.

470
00:27:48.193 --> 00:27:50.427
Hey, hon.
Yeah, I'm over at Mitch's.


471
00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:52.246
No, it's fine.

472
00:27:52.247 --> 00:27:54.064
He just threatened me
with a butcher knife though.


473
00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:55.699
Yeah. No, I'm kidding,
we're good. We're good.


474
00:27:55.701 --> 00:27:59.036
Let him know he's a douchebag?
Yeah, I'll let him know.


475
00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:02.339
Okay. Yeah.
No, I'll be done soon, okay.


476
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:04.141
And I'll head over there.
Just send me a list.


477
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.945
Got it. Alright. Love you. Bye.

478
00:28:09.615 --> 00:28:11.799
Everything all right?

479
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.984
Yeah. No, she just wants me to
make a Costco run on my way home


480
00:28:13.986 --> 00:28:15.719
because that's all marriage is,

481
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:19.056
an endless supply
of Costco runs.


482
00:28:19.058 --> 00:28:22.025
- Sounds like fun.
- It's a fucking delight.


483
00:28:22.027 --> 00:28:23.493
And I wish you were married

484
00:28:23.495 --> 00:28:25.629
so you could know
just how much I enjoy it.


485
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.301
You know, it's a pry
but whatever happened to Sophie?


486
00:28:37.142 --> 00:28:39.209
I tried to show her
who I really am,


487
00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:42.079
reveal myself to her,

488
00:28:43.115 --> 00:28:44.795
and I guess she just
wasn't ready for that.


489
00:28:45.551 --> 00:28:48.151
Well, Mitch, that's the
problem right there, buddy.


490
00:28:50.222 --> 00:28:52.322
You gotta stop revealing
yourself to women.


491
00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:57.194
Again, hearty ha ha. Laugh.

492
00:28:57.196 --> 00:28:58.628
- Don't you have to go?
- I do.


493
00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.264
Finish the avocados.
I'll see you soon.


494
00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:11.008
<i>Why don't you
ever stay the night?</i>


495
00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:16.513
I take care of my father.
You know that.


496
00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:26.757
You could put him
in a home or something


497
00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:29.726
or hiring home caring.

498
00:29:32.564 --> 00:29:35.565
I thought about it. But I got my
reasons for keeping him around.


499
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.770
You're always so guarded.

500
00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.506
I guess.

501
00:29:42.508 --> 00:29:46.676
It's just weird I've
never even met him.


502
00:29:46.678 --> 00:29:48.779
That's because I like you.

503
00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.103
You're smaller?

504
00:30:15.374 --> 00:30:18.408
I'm trying to create something
big and you're getting smaller?


505
00:30:21.814 --> 00:30:23.313
What are you telling me?

506
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:28.685
I don't know what
else to feed you.


507
00:30:31.223 --> 00:30:32.703
I'd kick your ass
if you even had one.


508
00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:38.728
No!

509
00:30:43.202 --> 00:30:46.470
Yeah.

510
00:30:46.472 --> 00:30:48.171
- <i>Hi, Mitch.</i>
- Natalie.


511
00:30:48.173 --> 00:30:50.607
How nice of you to call again.

512
00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:53.877
I'm just calling to congratulate
you on a great event.


513
00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:55.112
I'm sure.

514
00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:56.646
But while I have
you on the phone,


515
00:30:56.648 --> 00:30:58.448
is there any chance we could get

516
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.751
a first few chapters
of the novel by the weekend?


517
00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:04.754
That wasn't the deal.

518
00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:06.523
I know, I know
it wasn't the deal,


519
00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:09.359
but I'd like to do things a bit
differently this time around,


520
00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:13.363
so we can avoid those instances
of being perpetually late.


521
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.166
No need to beat around the bush.

522
00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:17.601
<i>I know, I'm just saying</i>

523
00:31:17.603 --> 00:31:20.203
that I don't want
to be late on this project.


524
00:31:20.205 --> 00:31:21.404
This is going to be the one

525
00:31:21.406 --> 00:31:24.441
that's gonna take you
way over the top.


526
00:31:24.443 --> 00:31:28.145
Yeah, I know, I want it to.

527
00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:29.713
Then we are on
the same page then?


528
00:31:30.516 --> 00:31:32.916
I'll see what I can
do over the weekend.


529
00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:34.484
<i>Great. That's good.</i>

530
00:31:55.307 --> 00:31:56.307
Fuck it.

531
00:32:02.247 --> 00:32:04.681
I know you get
this all the time.


532
00:32:04.683 --> 00:32:06.683
That's okay, go for it.

533
00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:08.919
Where do you get your ideas?

534
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:12.822
Things happen to me and then
I exaggerate for effect.


535
00:32:14.426 --> 00:32:18.295
How many shitty people could you
possibly have left to forgive?


536
00:32:18.297 --> 00:32:21.498
Self-development is
a lifelong process.


537
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.666
I guess.

538
00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:26.836
Don't worry, I don't have
anything against you... yet.


539
00:32:28.607 --> 00:32:30.440
You're funny.

Let me look at you.

543
00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:48.959
Well?

544
00:32:48.961 --> 00:32:50.227
You're gorgeous, Mary.

545
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.710
Uh...

What you looking at?

547
00:33:07.646 --> 00:33:10.013
Sorry. I'm nosey.

548
00:33:10.015 --> 00:33:11.715
It's okay.

549
00:33:11.717 --> 00:33:12.717
You know...

550
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.319
I thought I could be
a writer someday.


551
00:33:17.556 --> 00:33:18.855
Something special.

552
00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:21.591
I guess I just didn't
have the gift.


553
00:33:21.593 --> 00:33:24.461
Gift, curse, call it
wherever you like.


554
00:33:25.264 --> 00:33:27.831
- Don't be so dramatic.
- I know, I'm sorry.


555
00:33:29.835 --> 00:33:32.936
My latest book is
just missing something.


556
00:33:33.905 --> 00:33:36.306
It's like you never know
exactly what it takes.


557
00:33:36.308 --> 00:33:38.308
It takes a lot
out of you, doesn't it?


558
00:33:39.911 --> 00:33:42.545
Yeah. Nobody ever gets that.

559
00:33:49.755 --> 00:33:51.721
I don't like people
very close to me.


560
00:33:52.724 --> 00:33:54.691
This is why my last
relationship failed.


561
00:33:55.861 --> 00:33:59.396
This job requires
a certain type of isolation.


562
00:33:59.398 --> 00:34:02.899
Well, you must be
doing something right.


563
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:05.335
Maybe. I have my regrets.

564
00:34:06.605 --> 00:34:07.605
Who doesn't?

565
00:34:10.042 --> 00:34:11.408
You wanna go upstairs?

00:34:45.911 --> 00:34:49.512
What is that?

570
00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:54.517
I'm sorry, Mary.

571
00:35:19.111 --> 00:35:20.977
This isn't a story,
these are notes.


572
00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:22.645
What you got, writer's
block or something?


573
00:35:24.883 --> 00:35:26.483
Not enough is right.

574
00:35:31.456 --> 00:35:33.890
Fuck you. I liked her.

575
00:35:33.892 --> 00:35:36.493
I kept up my end of the bargain.
You give me what she is worth.


576
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.564
Make all the sound you want.
This is the last straw.


577
00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:42.799
I'll finish this book on my own

578
00:35:42.801 --> 00:35:44.534
like I should have
from the beginning.

Nope. I think you're mistaken.

588
00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:27.136
You are not Mitch Stockridge,
bestselling author,


589
00:37:27.138 --> 00:37:29.772
whose picture hangs
in every local bookstore?

Nope.

591

Without that cheesy get-up,
you'll look just like him.

- Mr. Stockridge,


593
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:39.549
I have a few questions
about Luke Rousseau.


594
00:37:41.052 --> 00:37:43.286
Alright. What do
you want to know?


595
00:37:43.288 --> 00:37:47.590
Well, I'm told he came to visit
you and then he never came home.


596
00:37:47.592 --> 00:37:48.691
That's not my problem.

597
00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:53.129
- You two had a history.
- You can say that.


598
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:54.664
What, did he visit you?

599
00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:56.199
He did and then he left.

600
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:58.301
What did you discuss?

601
00:37:58.303 --> 00:38:00.203
Nothing really. 
Just caught up.

602
00:38:00.205 --> 00:38:01.771
Hadn't seen him
since high-school.


603
00:38:02.574 --> 00:38:03.640
He liked the new book.

604
00:38:03.642 --> 00:38:07.710
Did he happen to mention where
he was headed after he left?


605
00:38:07.712 --> 00:38:09.279
Look, I'll save
you some digging.


606
00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:11.915
I never liked the guy much.

607
00:38:13.051 --> 00:38:15.051
And if you ask anybody
that knew us twenty years ago,


608
00:38:15.053 --> 00:38:16.686
they'll tell you the same thing.

609
00:38:16.688 --> 00:38:20.823
I wanted him gone... back then.

610
00:38:20.825 --> 00:38:23.693
We've moved on, all of us.

611
00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:26.229
And if that's all you have,
you wouldn't know how much.


612
00:38:26.231 --> 00:38:29.699
So, if you'll excuse me,
I am a little busy right now.

Well, I understand that,

614
00:38:31.252 --> 00:38:32.802
but I still have a few
questions for you, Sir.


615
00:38:32.804 --> 00:38:35.238
What makes you think that I
even remember where he went?


616
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.407
That was weeks ago.

617
00:38:37.408 --> 00:38:39.575
You never know.
They say writers are observant.


618
00:38:41.913 --> 00:38:44.080
I'm sorry I bothered you,
Mr. Stockridge.

- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

If you hear anything else,
give me a call.

Detective Abigail Dunn.

622

I prefer Abby.

623
00:38:57.228 --> 00:39:00.863
My ex-husband used to read
your inspirational stories.


624
00:39:00.865 --> 00:39:02.699
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


625
00:39:02.701 --> 00:39:05.134
- Happy to help.
- I didn't say they helped.

00:39:05.937 --> 00:39:09.038
All right.
Have a good one.

We haven't said anything.

630
00:39:41.406 --> 00:39:43.006
Be a lot easier
to get through things


631
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:44.641
if I stopped
getting interrupted.


632
00:39:44.643 --> 00:39:46.909
I'm gonna pretend you're
referring to other people.


633
00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:49.812
Well, I could choose
a cover if I had a book.


634
00:39:49.814 --> 00:39:52.148
And it's kind of hard for us
to come up with a cover


635
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.150
when we haven't got a book yet.

636
00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:56.219
Can we just slow things
down a little bit right now?


637
00:39:56.221 --> 00:39:57.920
I'm kind of going
through something here.


638
00:39:57.922 --> 00:40:00.690
Oh, Mitch,
you made a commitment.


639
00:40:00.692 --> 00:40:02.892
<i>You're gonna have
to live with it.</i>


640
00:40:11.903 --> 00:40:13.836
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

641
00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:24.414
I didn't peg you to be a reader
of self-help books, Detective.


642
00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:28.785
I tried to see what it would
give me on Luke Rousseau.


643
00:40:28.787 --> 00:40:31.021
It wasn't much.

644
00:40:31.022 --> 00:40:33.256
- Well, maybe Logan was right.
- Maybe.


645
00:40:33.258 --> 00:40:36.793
Well, in any event, I hope
you like missing person cases


646
00:40:36.795 --> 00:40:38.728
- because I've got another one.
- Let me guess.


647
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.763
Another drunk college kid
on daddy's boat.


648
00:40:40.765 --> 00:40:42.131
You wish.

649
00:40:42.133 --> 00:40:45.201
This one is a sad story.
A woman named Mary.


650
00:40:45.203 --> 00:40:47.036
Christ.

651
00:40:47.038 --> 00:40:49.172
- Any leads?
- Nothing so far.


652
00:40:49.174 --> 00:40:51.374
I guess there's no
justice in this world.


653
00:40:51.376 --> 00:40:54.377
If you find any, make sure
the front desk knows.


654
00:40:59.984 --> 00:41:01.451
Okay.

655
00:41:01.453 --> 00:41:03.186
I propose a toast right now

656
00:41:03.188 --> 00:41:05.121
to the best first draft

657
00:41:05.123 --> 00:41:09.225
of the best novel
since Jane Eyre.


658
00:41:10.462 --> 00:41:12.261
Please don't laugh.

659
00:41:12.263 --> 00:41:14.897
- Don't. It's insulting.
- Jane Eyre?


660
00:41:14.899 --> 00:41:17.233
It's literally the only novel
I can think of at the time.


661
00:41:17.235 --> 00:41:19.035
Did you google books
just to drop that one?


662
00:41:19.037 --> 00:41:21.270
Okay, I like Jane Eyre,
I have a feminine side.


663
00:41:22.107 --> 00:41:24.140
What? Stop.

664
00:41:24.142 --> 00:41:25.475
Cheers, Nick.

665
00:41:25.477 --> 00:41:27.877
Now I know why are you
over here all the damn time.


666
00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:30.747
I haven't toked like this
since grad school.


667
00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:32.048
- Did she say toked?
- Mm-Hm.


668
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.783
Is that the word
she just used, "toked"?


669
00:41:33.785 --> 00:41:35.351
I've never heard my wife
use that word before.


670
00:41:35.353 --> 00:41:37.420
- My classy, classy wife.
- Hey.


671
00:41:37.422 --> 00:41:39.355
I'm allowed to have
a masculine side.


672
00:41:39.357 --> 00:41:40.389
Yes, you are.

673
00:41:40.391 --> 00:41:42.859
Mm. I'm out.

674
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:44.227
Let me get you another
one real quick.


675
00:41:44.229 --> 00:41:45.962
Fresh out.
I'm gonna go make a run.


676
00:41:45.964 --> 00:41:47.430
Not like this, you're not.

677
00:41:47.432 --> 00:41:49.065
It's a few beers. I'm fine.

678
00:41:49.067 --> 00:41:50.299
Mitch, don't.

679
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:51.768
You two have fun.

680
00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:54.971
Drive safe, buddy.

681
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.010
He can't just go on like this.

682
00:42:02.046 --> 00:42:03.846
There's nothing
I can do for him. I know.


683
00:42:03.848 --> 00:42:05.314
It's not your job.

684
00:42:05.316 --> 00:42:06.516
You can't just
take care of him...


685
00:42:06.518 --> 00:42:08.251
I know. Listen, okay?

686
00:42:08.253 --> 00:42:10.186
You are not there when
the crowds are there


687
00:42:10.188 --> 00:42:12.388
and the parties, everybody is
gushing over the guy, okay?


688
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.523
I'm there in the alone time

689
00:42:13.525 --> 00:42:16.559
and I see how he is
and how he acts.


690
00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:18.261
While I'm sitting home alone?

691
00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:19.796
You don't have
to sit home alone.


692
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:21.297
You go out have
girl time if you want.


693
00:42:21.299 --> 00:42:24.267
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


694
00:42:24.269 --> 00:42:26.369
Okay, listen, right?

695
00:42:26.371 --> 00:42:27.503
Mitch is my best friend.

696
00:42:27.505 --> 00:42:30.540
He is just going through
a rough period right now, okay?


697
00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:31.808
That's it.

698
00:42:33.812 --> 00:42:35.344
He brings it on himself.

699
00:42:36.147 --> 00:42:38.147
He is never happy.

700
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:41.417
Yeah, I know he is not.

701
00:42:57.502 --> 00:42:59.836
Small world. Hi there.

702
00:43:02.006 --> 00:43:04.073
You followed me
to the store, really?


703
00:43:05.944 --> 00:43:08.177
I'm not here on business,
Mr. Stockridge.


704
00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:10.446
Contrary to what you
may have seen on TV,


705
00:43:10.448 --> 00:43:13.382
cops do not subsist
exclusively on donuts.


706
00:43:13.384 --> 00:43:15.885
Are you denying that you
like donuts, Detective?


707
00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:18.221
Don't be ridiculous.
They are delicious.


708
00:43:18.223 --> 00:43:20.590
- Excuse me, Mr. Stockridge.
- Oh, hi.


709
00:43:20.592 --> 00:43:23.159
Hi. I can't believe it.

710
00:43:23.161 --> 00:43:25.328
- I'm your biggest fan. Do you...
- Yes.


711
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.930
- Do you think you could?
- Yes, of course.


712
00:43:33.004 --> 00:43:34.136
Thank you so much.

713
00:43:34.138 --> 00:43:35.354
You're welcome.

714
00:43:35.355 --> 00:43:36.635
Your book saved
my friend's life.


715
00:43:40.979 --> 00:43:42.311
Wow.

716
00:43:42.313 --> 00:43:45.548
You saved a life.
Not many authors can say that.


717
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.616
What do you want?

718
00:43:46.618 --> 00:43:48.951
Nothing. I promise.

719
00:43:48.953 --> 00:43:53.289
Although, since we are
both here shopping for juice,


720
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:56.292
I will confess I do have
a few more questions.


721
00:43:56.294 --> 00:43:58.294
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
have any more answers.


722
00:43:58.296 --> 00:44:01.030
- Not about Luke Rousseau.
- Oh.


723
00:44:01.032 --> 00:44:02.465
You were recently
seen having drinks


724
00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:04.233
with a woman named Mary Rollins.

725
00:44:04.235 --> 00:44:06.168
I can provide you with
the date, time and location


726
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.470
if that would refresh
your memory.


727
00:44:07.472 --> 00:44:10.072
I remember. Nice girl.

728
00:44:10.074 --> 00:44:14.343
Well, it was bar, so eyewitness
memories are predictively fuzzy.


729
00:44:14.345 --> 00:44:16.145
No one can be sure
they saw her leave.


730
00:44:16.147 --> 00:44:18.481
- I was wondering if you did.
- Can't help you.


731
00:44:18.483 --> 00:44:20.350
So, we done here?

732
00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:22.218
Another person is missing,
Mr. Stockridge.


733
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.953
Most people might express

734
00:44:23.955 --> 00:44:26.255
little more interest
in the situation you're at.


735
00:44:26.257 --> 00:44:27.257
Leave me alone.

736
00:44:29.427 --> 00:44:30.459
Suit yourself.

737
00:44:31.596 --> 00:44:33.396
Enjoy your day.

738
00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:37.783
Oh, Detective,

739
00:44:37.784 --> 00:44:40.101
I just remembered donuts
are on aisle nine, FYI.


740
00:44:54.419 --> 00:44:55.451
Got a treat for you.

741
00:44:57.588 --> 00:44:59.288
That's just poison.

742
00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.530
What are you, a health nut now?

743
00:45:01.693 --> 00:45:03.092
What you got to live
for anyways?


744
00:45:03.094 --> 00:45:04.360
Who are those people downstairs?

745
00:45:04.362 --> 00:45:06.329
It's Nick and Laura.

746
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.965
You still hanging
around that Nick kid?


747
00:45:08.967 --> 00:45:10.533
Damn!

748
00:45:10.535 --> 00:45:13.302
- She's still eight feet tall?
- It's actually worse, dad.


749
00:45:13.304 --> 00:45:15.304
I'm still hanging around you.

750
00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:16.672
You love to complain.

751
00:45:17.742 --> 00:45:20.643
I was half as bad
as you say I am.


752
00:45:20.645 --> 00:45:23.279
You put a pillow
over my face long ago.


753
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:24.714
I would never do that, dad.

754
00:45:24.716 --> 00:45:26.983
These pillows are
way too expensive.


755
00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:30.386
- Oh, my son!
- That's debatable.


756
00:45:52.543 --> 00:45:53.709
Working on it!

757
00:46:07.759 --> 00:46:09.158
Hi.

758
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.693
Jab cross.

759
00:46:10.695 --> 00:46:13.029
Put some power on it. Jab cross!

760
00:46:14.098 --> 00:46:15.564
I want some power. One, two.

761
00:46:16.434 --> 00:46:18.067
Think of someone
you hate. One, two.


762
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.070
Think of someone you hate!

763
00:46:21.072 --> 00:46:22.538
Come on!

764
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.807
I said someone
you hate. One, two.


765
00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:27.309
Come on. Come on!

766
00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:30.112
I said someone you hate!

767
00:46:30.114 --> 00:46:32.348
One, two!

768
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:35.117
Come on! Come on!

00:49:45.409 --> 00:49:46.875
Yeah, I got your email.

787
00:49:46.877 --> 00:49:49.011
<i>Yeah, theirs is
few review copies gone out</i>


788
00:49:49.013 --> 00:49:51.714
<i>and there's a few copies
floating around the office.</i>


789
00:49:51.716 --> 00:49:53.799
What are the interns saying?

790
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.883
<i>Well, you know, Mitch, this is...
This is really ambitious.</i>


791
00:49:55.886 --> 00:49:58.420
<i>I think you should be
really proud of yourself.</i>


792
00:49:58.422 --> 00:50:00.489
I am proud.

793
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:02.557
<i>I just hope you are hard
at work on the next one.</i>


794
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.261
Yeah, I just got pages
flowing out of me.


795
00:50:06.564 --> 00:50:08.030
Any updates, Detective?

796
00:50:08.032 --> 00:50:09.565
None so far, Sir.

797
00:50:09.567 --> 00:50:11.500
I have been keeping
a close eye on him,


798
00:50:11.502 --> 00:50:14.403
but I've got about as close
as I can get without a warrant.


799
00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:16.805
No, remember, we want
to keep this quiet.


800
00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:18.040
He's kind of a big shot in town.

801
00:50:18.042 --> 00:50:19.875
Big shots are my specialty, Sir.

802
00:50:19.877 --> 00:50:22.678
Detective,
we do not want a repeat


803
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.446
of your last investigation.

804
00:50:24.448 --> 00:50:25.948
There won't be, Sir.

805
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.950
Good.

806
00:50:27.885 --> 00:50:30.619
Just play it cool
with Stockridge.


807
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:33.022
- No more gut feelings.
- Understood.


808
00:50:50.408 --> 00:50:52.441
Yeah, gotcha.

809
00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:09.825
Yeah, I know.

810
00:51:13.664 --> 00:51:14.997
I'm just disappointed.

811
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.566
You can do better than that.

812
00:51:17.568 --> 00:51:20.836
Fuck you, grand old
dork motherfucker.


813
00:51:21.706 --> 00:51:22.871
Piece of shit!

814
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:32.614
You seem tense.

815
00:51:33.451 --> 00:51:34.717
I hope you're happy

816
00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:37.753
because they're saying what
you've been saying all along.


817
00:51:38.556 --> 00:51:40.489
I'll have to take
your word for it.


818
00:51:41.525 --> 00:51:43.425
I don't get them much.

819
00:51:43.427 --> 00:51:45.027
I tried to do
something different,


820
00:51:45.029 --> 00:51:47.029
something new,
something from here.


821
00:51:50.433 --> 00:51:51.999
But in the end, it was
the same old trick.


822
00:51:52.002 --> 00:51:54.470
What are you telling me for?

823
00:51:54.472 --> 00:51:56.538
Because I don't have
mom to talk to anymore.


824
00:51:57.742 --> 00:51:59.375
She would have made you soft.

825
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:16.892
I guess I'm just more
of a short story guy, huh?


826
00:52:16.894 --> 00:52:18.460
Aren't you on top of this?

827
00:52:18.462 --> 00:52:20.629
We publicized all we could.

828
00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:24.800
I guess one week here on top,
next week it's a ghost town.


829
00:52:28.005 --> 00:52:29.038
I just don't understand.

830
00:52:29.039 --> 00:52:30.072
- The book's out and...
- And?


831
00:52:30.074 --> 00:52:32.174
Well, you read the reviews.

832
00:52:32.176 --> 00:52:33.976
I just don't get it.
This book has everything.


833
00:52:33.978 --> 00:52:36.745
I know, your blood,
your sweat, your tears.


834
00:52:36.747 --> 00:52:39.148
Is this the
Terrance Williams signing?


835
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:40.883
No, he was here yesterday.

836
00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:42.818
Oh. Sorry.

837
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.053
- Fucking Terrance.
- Oh, come on, Mitch.


838
00:52:45.055 --> 00:52:47.456
You know the reading
public's fickle.


839
00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:49.825
Maybe they just needed something
different this time around.


840
00:52:49.827 --> 00:52:52.528
- Thanks for your input.
- I'm just trying to be helpful.


841
00:52:53.197 --> 00:52:55.731
Oh, great, hope that
makes you feel better.


842
00:53:00.638 --> 00:53:01.721
<i>Voilà.</i>

843
00:53:01.722 --> 00:53:02.805
It's better be
as good as you say.


844
00:53:02.807 --> 00:53:04.473
You've been rolling it
for half hour.


845
00:53:16.787 --> 00:53:17.787
I love you.

846
00:53:24.995 --> 00:53:28.230
I just don't know what happened.
There was like nobody there.


847
00:53:28.232 --> 00:53:29.798
Well, I'll be honest.

848
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:31.867
You finished it last night.

849
00:53:34.572 --> 00:53:35.572
Yeah?

850
00:53:38.042 --> 00:53:39.975
I'm your friend, I'm gonna
give it to you straight.


851
00:53:39.977 --> 00:53:40.977
I know.

852
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.481
Something is different
about you, man.


853
00:53:45.483 --> 00:53:47.716
Something's changed.
I don't know what it is.


854
00:53:48.686 --> 00:53:50.652
And maybe you need to stay
with the small stuff.


855
00:53:50.654 --> 00:53:52.014
No one is gonna
fault you for that.


856
00:53:52.823 --> 00:53:54.673
Some people will.

857
00:53:54.674 --> 00:53:56.524
Come on, Mitch, who's
gonna fault you for that?


858
00:53:58.629 --> 00:54:00.662
Nick, what motivates you
to get up in the morning,


859
00:54:00.664 --> 00:54:01.864
go to the office and all that?

860
00:54:04.768 --> 00:54:06.128
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have a job.


861
00:54:09.273 --> 00:54:10.873
I don't know what
you want me to say, man.


862
00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:12.174
I mean, I'm living it up here.

863
00:54:12.176 --> 00:54:14.009
You know, I got a
great middle-class life.


864
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:17.813
I have a wife who's
way too hot for me.


865
00:54:17.815 --> 00:54:20.015
It's more than we could've
ever dreamed of as kids.


866
00:54:21.252 --> 00:54:23.986
All we had as kids it's Luke
Rousseau beating our faces in


867
00:54:23.988 --> 00:54:26.255
every day for our lunch money.

868
00:54:26.257 --> 00:54:29.825
And if you lost your job,
your career went belly-up,


869
00:54:29.827 --> 00:54:31.994
how would Laura react?

870
00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:35.264
Laura would be
extremely disappointed.


871
00:54:35.266 --> 00:54:36.632
She'd be pissed off for a while.

872
00:54:37.868 --> 00:54:40.068
But Laura doesn't depend
on material things


873
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.670
to make her happy.

874
00:54:41.672 --> 00:54:43.205
Let's say you did
a really good job at work,


875
00:54:43.207 --> 00:54:45.908
and you got a promotion
and a bonus


876
00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:49.044
or whatever, and you were
able to buy a bigger house.


877
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.014
Then, not to say it's bad now,

878
00:54:52.016 --> 00:54:53.949
but your relationship
would be better, right?


879
00:54:55.553 --> 00:54:56.852
Can be worse.
I'll give you that.


880
00:54:56.854 --> 00:54:58.687
Okay, then you see
where I'm coming from.


881
00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:03.158
Here comes the airplane.

882
00:55:06.964 --> 00:55:08.997
Look who's in a good mood.

883
00:55:09.867 --> 00:55:12.167
Yeah, I am.

884
00:55:12.169 --> 00:55:13.669
I finally figured something out.

885
00:55:19.043 --> 00:55:20.175
From now on,

886
00:55:21.245 --> 00:55:23.278
you're gonna like
me for who I am


887
00:55:24.114 --> 00:55:27.282
or you can just
go fuck yourself.


888
00:55:28.919 --> 00:55:30.018
What about you?

889
00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:34.022
Do you like yourself?

890
00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:35.190
I'm gonna give it a try.

891
00:55:36.994 --> 00:55:39.328
You hate yourself, Mitch.

892
00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:51.873
♫♫♫

893

00:57:43.287 --> 00:57:44.786
Wow!

898
00:57:44.788 --> 00:57:47.823
- Only an hour late this time.
- Yeah, sorry.


899
00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:50.826
I get down here from New York

900
00:57:50.828 --> 00:57:52.961
and you can't
make it six blocks?


901
00:57:52.963 --> 00:57:54.396
I'm busy, come on.

902
00:57:54.398 --> 00:57:57.332
I can't be the first writer
to be behind on a deadline.


903
00:57:57.334 --> 00:57:59.134
Yeah, well, about that.

904
00:57:59.136 --> 00:58:00.302
What?

905
00:58:01.405 --> 00:58:03.138
You got a contract
for two books.


906
00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.140
We haven't seen
the second book yet.


907
00:58:05.142 --> 00:58:06.475
The first one wasn't that great,

908
00:58:06.477 --> 00:58:07.976
so what's the rush
for the next one?


909
00:58:07.978 --> 00:58:10.178
You've had enough extensions.

910
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:13.415
Yeah, we need the manuscript
and we need it in a week.


911
00:58:13.417 --> 00:58:14.349
A week?

912
00:58:14.351 --> 00:58:17.486
That's impossible.
That's not gonna happen.


913
00:58:17.488 --> 00:58:20.789
Well, then we're gonna sue
you for breach of contract.


914
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:21.757
What?

915
00:58:21.759 --> 00:58:25.527
Look, your last book
didn't work out, now did it?


916
00:58:25.529 --> 00:58:27.496
We need something new from you

917
00:58:27.498 --> 00:58:30.165
to fill the shelves
and cover up, a stanch.


918
00:58:30.167 --> 00:58:33.535
And we are less likely
to play nice with you Mitch


919
00:58:33.537 --> 00:58:36.071
after the last debacle.

920
00:58:36.073 --> 00:58:37.139
I'm being serious.

921
00:58:37.941 --> 00:58:39.441
I made your reputation.

922
00:58:39.443 --> 00:58:41.810
Yeah, and we made yours.

923
00:58:41.811 --> 00:58:44.178
And you know, if you
could just get things to us


924
00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:47.516
in plenty of time so we could
edit it to our satisfaction


925
00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:50.085
instead of a usual trick
of bringing us things


926
00:58:50.087 --> 00:58:52.854
three minutes
before the deadline.


927
00:58:52.856 --> 00:58:56.958
Honestly, Mitch, you artistic
types, you all are the same!


928
00:58:57.961 --> 00:59:01.830
Plenty of ideas,
nothing to show for it.


929
00:59:01.832 --> 00:59:03.431
Now, what are we in
the hole for here anyways?


930
00:59:03.433 --> 00:59:05.300
We're selling paper

931
00:59:05.301 --> 00:59:07.168
and most of the business
is in e-books anyway.


932
00:59:08.038 --> 00:59:10.172
So, the last one
didn't go that well.


933
00:59:10.174 --> 00:59:11.724
We'll make it up.

934
00:59:11.725 --> 00:59:13.275
- Not good enough.
- I'll give you good enough.


935
00:59:13.277 --> 00:59:15.510
Yeah, well just give me
good enough in seven days.


936
00:59:31.562 --> 00:59:34.329
All right.
I'm gonna take you upstairs.


937
00:59:34.331 --> 00:59:37.065
Okay. What's upstairs?

938
00:59:37.067 --> 00:59:38.366
A surprise.

939
00:59:38.368 --> 00:59:40.302
- Should I close my eyes?
- No.


940
00:59:41.438 --> 00:59:44.206
I want to open your eyes for the
first time in our relationship.


941
00:59:44.208 --> 00:59:46.975
Right, there's that mysterious

I love you.

945
00:59:59.389 --> 01:00:01.323
I haven't said that
to a lot of women.


946
01:00:02.359 --> 01:00:04.893
I want to be honest
with you about everything


947

Come on.

948
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:13.602
Shhh, shhh.

949
01:00:14.538 --> 01:00:15.538
Listen.

950
01:00:18.308 --> 01:00:19.608
I don't hear anything.

951
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:22.510
It's being quiet.

952
01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:25.180
I've been keeping it in check
since you've been coming over.


953
01:00:25.182 --> 01:00:27.482
What are you hiding in there?

954
01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.285
Really?

955
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.052
The truth.

956
01:00:31.054 --> 01:00:33.955
Something I've never
shown anyone before.


957
01:00:35.225 --> 01:00:36.625
Well, let's get this over with.

958
01:00:37.427 --> 01:00:39.194
I'm gonna close your eyes now.

959
01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:43.531
Okay.

960
01:00:49.139 --> 01:00:51.573
Surprise, it's me.

961
01:00:56.013 --> 01:00:57.045
What?

962
01:00:58.282 --> 01:01:01.016
That's how I get
my ideas for my stories.


963
01:01:01.018 --> 01:01:04.152
I defeated people
but it's how it works.


964
01:01:04.154 --> 01:01:06.054
I... I don't understand.

965
01:01:06.056 --> 01:01:08.156
It just showed up one night.
I don't know.

Sophie, I do this for us.

Hi yourself.

973
01:02:04.948 --> 01:02:07.348
It's the part where you ask me
if I want to have a good time?


974
01:02:09.586 --> 01:02:11.052
Hard to get it like it.

975
01:02:12.356 --> 01:02:13.488
How much?

976
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:15.190
All depends on
how much you want.


977
01:02:15.192 --> 01:02:16.324
Fair enough.

978
01:02:18.128 --> 01:02:19.294
I've got money, don't worry.

979

Who is worried?

980

Come on.

981
01:02:36.513 --> 01:02:39.214
You are under arrest for
solicitation of a prostitute.


982
01:02:39.216 --> 01:02:40.682
This is entrapment.

983
01:02:40.684 --> 01:02:42.150
You asked me, big boy.

984
01:02:42.152 --> 01:02:44.085
You have the right
to remain silent.


985
01:02:44.087 --> 01:02:47.022
Anything you say maybe held
against you in the court of law.


986
01:02:47.024 --> 01:02:48.289
Wonderful.

987

I have been trying to get
warrant on this guy since...

01:03:19.389 --> 01:03:21.189
This may be my chance.

994
01:03:22.292 --> 01:03:24.009
With this in his file,

995
01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.727
someone up the chain may see
that he's not so perfect

Do we need to go
get your car now?


1000

I'll take care
of it in the morning.


1001
01:03:47.684 --> 01:03:51.853
God, Mitch, this Sophie thing
must have you really fucked up


1002
01:03:51.855 --> 01:03:53.388
if you're picking up hookers.

1003
01:03:56.359 --> 01:04:00.128
I was gonna kill her
and hope nobody would notice.


1004
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.230
It's good. You should keep
that charming sense of humor,


1005
01:04:02.232 --> 01:04:03.565
it's getting you far.

1006
01:04:03.567 --> 01:04:06.201
I'm fucking drained.

1007
01:04:06.203 --> 01:04:09.237
You know, I wasn't gonna say
anything but you look like shit.


1008
01:04:09.239 --> 01:04:10.338
I was in jail.

1009
01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.506
I know.

1010
01:04:11.508 --> 01:04:13.741
And I hope you've
made a lot of friends,


1011
01:04:13.743 --> 01:04:16.778
friends you can confide in,
talk to, you know.


1012
01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:19.681
I feel like shit.

1013
01:04:21.251 --> 01:04:23.284
I've been in a bad
place for a while, Nick.


1014
01:04:23.286 --> 01:04:25.220
That's generally the reason

1015
01:04:25.222 --> 01:04:27.622
people pick up hookers
in the first place.


1016
01:04:27.624 --> 01:04:28.723
No, it's not that.

1017
01:04:32.629 --> 01:04:34.562
I think I know what
I need to do now


1018
01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:37.398
and a hooker wasn't
gonna be enough.


1019
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.703
I got some rainy day
money upstairs...


1020
01:04:43.273 --> 01:04:44.305
to get you paid.

1021
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.474
Come with me.

1022
01:04:58.788 --> 01:05:00.288
All right. So, I
kind of understand


1023
01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:02.457
why you don't want people
snooping around up here.


1024
01:05:03.293 --> 01:05:05.827
Well, I think after all
these years my secret is safe.


1025
01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:08.496
I can't believe
I'm even up here.


1026
01:05:08.498 --> 01:05:10.765
You've kept this whole
upstairs from me for so long.


1027
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.669
I almost don't want to show you.

1028
01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:17.439
Show me what?

1029
01:05:18.909 --> 01:05:19.909
Me.

1030
01:05:32.622 --> 01:05:33.888
I know, right?

1031
01:05:36.726 --> 01:05:37.825
What is that?

1032
01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:41.362
I'm trying to figure out
for years, believe me.

Yeah.

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:41.149
Barely.

1105
01:12:44.921 --> 01:12:47.154
Well, Son, you did it.

1106
01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:50.291
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No.


1107
01:12:50.293 --> 01:12:51.626
This time you did it.

1108
01:12:56.366 --> 01:12:57.366
Thanks, Dad.

1109
01:12:58.301 --> 01:12:59.367
It means the world to me.

1110
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:04.372
Is that what you really
all you were waiting for?


1111
01:13:04.374 --> 01:13:05.840
You really are a mess,
aren't you?


1112
01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:10.177
If you actually thought anything
you've done with your life


1113
01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:11.379
was worth a damn,

1114
01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:13.881
you wouldn't be so
worried about what I felt


1115
01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:17.885
and you wouldn't be so angry
at the world all the time.


1116
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:22.323
You're right, Dad,

1117
01:13:23.993 --> 01:13:25.760
I don't need to be
angry anymore.

What?

01:14:55.384 --> 01:14:56.884
Thank you so much for the time.

1125
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:03.057
- Mr. Stockridge.
- Detective.


1126
01:15:03.059 --> 01:15:05.126
It is so nice to see you again.

1127
01:15:05.995 --> 01:15:07.495
I feel like you have
a thing for me.


1128
01:15:07.497 --> 01:15:10.765
Mr. Stockridge, I recently
received a distraught phone call


1129
01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:11.966
from a grieving widow.

1130
01:15:12.802 --> 01:15:14.802
I had nothing new to tell her.

1131
01:15:14.804 --> 01:15:16.537
She had nothing new to tell me.

1132
01:15:16.539 --> 01:15:19.974
- Well, except for one thing.
- And what's that?


1133
01:15:21.511 --> 01:15:23.745
Quite by chance,

1134
01:15:23.746 --> 01:15:25.980
poor Mrs. Brennaman
corroborated Ms. Dettler's story


1135
01:15:25.982 --> 01:15:28.015
about rooms on the second floor

1136
01:15:28.017 --> 01:15:30.451
that no one was
allowed to go in.


1137
01:15:30.453 --> 01:15:31.453
Hmm...

1138
01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:34.021
I see.

1139
01:15:34.023 --> 01:15:36.257
I see, I see, I see.

1140
01:15:37.326 --> 01:15:40.828
- I'm a very private person.
- Mitch, I have a warrant.


1141
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.798
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.


1142
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.900
I guess you got what you
wanted then, Detective.


1143
01:15:46.836 --> 01:15:48.169
Will there be anything else?

1144
01:15:48.171 --> 01:15:49.904
I need to go meet
with my publisher.


1145
01:15:51.374 --> 01:15:53.407
If you like books,
you're welcome to join us.


1146
01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:58.379
You know I know you never
shed any tears for Luke Rousseau


1147
01:15:58.381 --> 01:16:02.850
and I can accept that you made
yourself not care about any


1148
01:16:02.852 --> 01:16:05.119
or many of the others.

1149
01:16:06.088 --> 01:16:09.990
- Nick Brennaman was your friend.
- And I miss him every day.


1150
01:16:09.992 --> 01:16:11.926
I'll choose to believe that.

1151
01:16:11.927 --> 01:16:13.861
I noticed you made a beeline
for the room upstairs,


1152
01:16:13.863 --> 01:16:16.197
like you knew exactly
what you were looking for.


1153
01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:19.333
I'm not mad.

1154
01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:22.403
I'm just wondering
how much do you know.


1155
01:16:22.405 --> 01:16:24.856
I know enough.

1156
01:16:24.857 --> 01:16:27.308
Well, then you'll know no one's
going to believe your story.


1157
01:16:30.246 --> 01:16:34.148
- You're a monster, Stockridge.
- I take your word for it.


1158
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:35.516
I help people.

1159
01:16:35.518 --> 01:16:38.319
You remember the woman
from the grocery store.


1160
01:16:38.321 --> 01:16:39.887
She said I saved
her friend's life.


1161
01:16:39.889 --> 01:16:41.856
Even you were impressed.

1162
01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:44.291
You think your books
help everyone, huh?


1163
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:48.629
Well, guess again,
they didn't help me.


1164
01:16:48.631 --> 01:16:50.865
How? You act like I destroyed
your life or something.


1165
01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:54.869
But you did, Mitch the bitch.

1166
01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:58.539
Your little stories,
inspirational stories


1167
01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:01.175
inspired my husband
to follow his dreams


1168
01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:03.143
and walk out on his family.

1169
01:17:03.145 --> 01:17:05.212
So that's what
this has been about.


1170
01:17:05.214 --> 01:17:10.150
We were happy, happy
and then you ruined everything.


1171
01:17:10.152 --> 01:17:12.219
You'll never know how many
people I actually helped.


1172
01:17:12.221 --> 01:17:13.888
Where is Nick, Mitch?

1173
01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.940
He is not here.

1174
01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:17.991
How could you do this
to your best friend?


1175
01:17:17.994 --> 01:17:19.260
You're just projecting.

1176
01:17:19.262 --> 01:17:20.527
- You're a monster.
- Leave.


1177
01:17:21.364 --> 01:17:24.531
You're a selfish piece
of shit and I swear...


1178
01:17:24.533 --> 01:17:27.201
I help people.
My books help people.


1179
01:17:27.203 --> 01:17:30.371
God, keep telling yourself that.

1180
01:17:30.373 --> 01:17:31.906
Goodbye, Detective.

You're being nice.

Don't take it, personal.
You know how it is.

Oh, come on, Mitch.
Let's talk about...


1206
01:19:05.668 --> 01:19:08.402
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Don't be angry.

That's the funny thing.

Well, it's sort of like this:

1219
01:19:50.813 --> 01:19:53.547
Ever since I was a little kid
I've been haunted by a monster


1220
01:19:53.549 --> 01:19:56.283
and I feed it
sacrifices of people


1221
01:19:56.285 --> 01:19:59.119
and, in return, it spits out
an outline for a best-seller


1222
01:19:59.121 --> 01:20:01.388
and I just can't stop.

1223

Uh...

1224
01:20:05.161 --> 01:20:09.363
Okay, well that's
why you're a writer.


1225
01:20:09.365 --> 01:20:12.366
All right then. Wow.

1226
01:20:53.776 --> 01:20:57.344
