1
00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:40.860
What's going on, honey?

2
00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:46.818
Are you OK?

3
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:50.360
Hanging on...

4
00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:57.902
Let's do this, OK?

5
00:01:58.777 --> 00:01:59.943
Yes.

6
00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:02.652
We're in this together.

7
00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.943
- Don't fall apart on me, honey. Please.
- No.


8
00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:08.568
No.

9
00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:12.652
Do it for him.

10
00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:24.235
Let's do this.

11
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.693
- Chin up.
- Yes.


12
00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:48.360
So, parents,

13
00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:52.443
grab your children
and get into the bag with them.


14
00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:57.402
On my signal,
move towards the goal line, me.


15
00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:01.318
So, no cheating.

16
00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:05.902
The first team that makes it
all the way over there, wins.


17
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.693
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!


18
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:11.777
- I can't hear you. Are you ready?
- Yeah!


19
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.818
OK, on your marks...

20
00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:17.860
Ready...

21
00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:24.985
- Come on!
- Go for it!


22
00:03:50.568 --> 00:03:52.235
Hey, Andres.

23
00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:07.568
- Help me.
- Where to?


24
00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:29.402
FIVE YEARS LATER

25
00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:43.985
- Are these yours?
- No, it's that one over there.


26
00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:50.152
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy your vacation.


27
00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:54.402
- This one's open.
- Enjoy your stay.


28
00:04:54.902 --> 00:04:56.777
- Is it OK?
- Yes.


29
00:05:00.152 --> 00:05:01.527
Thank you. Goodbye.

30
00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:05.777
- You?
- Take this. No, I'll take it.


31
00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:11.860
Nice, isn't it?

32
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.235
- Can you manage?
- Yes.


33
00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:44.818
This place is beautiful.

34
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.943
Great. Isn't it?

35
00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:58.443
- How could you afford this?
- Don't worry, honey.


36
00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:00.652
We're going to enjoy it.

37
00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:06.152
Let's see, Raton.

38
00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:16.527
Look at that.

39
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.860
Do you like it?

40
00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:25.152
It's perfect.

41
00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:59.652
- I have to wake up Pedrito.
- Why?


42
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:01.360
- I promised him I would.
- No.


43
00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:04.402
- He wanted to go for a swim.
- We'll be here for a week.


44
00:07:09.277 --> 00:07:11.527
- I promised him.
- No.


45
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.068
No. Honey, please. Come on.

46
00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:35.277
Raton.

47
00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:37.943
We're here.

48
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.693
Do you want to go for a swim?

49
00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:43.818
Raton?

50
00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:47.152
Do you want to go in the pool?

51
00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:49.652
Do you?

52
00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:17.402
Mommy.

53
00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.402
Mommy.

54
00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:29.443
I don't want to swim
with these shoes anymore.


55
00:08:30.027 --> 00:08:33.235
That's OK, sweetheart. 
Leave them here.

56
00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:39.443
- What's wrong with his shoes?
- They're uncomfortable.


57
00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:42.235
- Can you touch the bottom?
- Yes.


58
00:08:48.777 --> 00:08:51.402
That's strange. Let's see.

59
00:08:53.693 --> 00:08:55.360
- Is it here?
- Yes.


60
00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:57.568
Good evening.

61
00:09:01.318 --> 00:09:02.652
How can I help you?

62
00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:06.527
We want to know why you won't
let this gentleman into his villa.


63
00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:20.027
I'm sorry. I don't even know these people.

64
00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:22.318
Well, this gentleman has a reservation.

65
00:09:22.402 --> 00:09:25.110
You shouldn't leave them outside
getting bitten by mosquitoes.


66
00:09:25.193 --> 00:09:28.610
Well, I'm very sorry,
but I have a reservation too.


67
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.860
His wife thought someone
had broken into the house.


68
00:09:36.402 --> 00:09:39.777
- Are you calling me a thief?
- No, no, no. It's not that.


69
00:09:40.527 --> 00:09:43.402
It's just that I don't see your papers
and he has his.


70
00:09:44.068 --> 00:09:45.943
My papers are inside, but look...

71
00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:48.402
here's my key.

72
00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:53.568
And here's mine.

73
00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.318
Well, that's weird.

74
00:09:56.402 --> 00:09:59.068
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


75
00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.277
Is everything OK?

76
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.943
Yes, Mr... What's your name?
Sorry, I didn't hear your name.


77
00:10:06.027 --> 00:10:08.235
Bonilla. Abel Bonilla.

78
00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:10.860
It looks like Mr. Bonilla
has a reservation here as well.


79
00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.860
There's obviously some kind of mix-up.

80
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.277
Sorry to bother. But without papers,
one can never be sure.


81
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.152
- But you do have the papers, right?
- Of course. The papers are inside.


82
00:10:22.777 --> 00:10:25.027
So, what should we do now?

83
00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:28.485
Come inside.
There are loads of mosquitoes out here.


84
00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:30.110
We'll solve this.

85
00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:32.735
- We can just make a phone call.
- Yes.


86
00:10:39.318 --> 00:10:42.527
You can leave your luggage here.
It will be fine. No one's stealing it.


87
00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.818
Bring your bags in, kids. Excuse me.

88
00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.027
How about a shower?

89
00:11:00.652 --> 00:11:02.402
Do you want to stay here with Mommy?

90
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.735
- Is it just him?
- Yes, we only have one.


91
00:11:07.193 --> 00:11:10.610
- How old are you?
- Go on, tell her.


92
00:11:11.902 --> 00:11:15.027
Were you asking me? I'm 30.

93
00:11:15.443 --> 00:11:17.485
You're really pretty.

94
00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:19.693
No one's picking up. 
What should we do?

95
00:11:20.277 --> 00:11:24.527
I told you, we don't have the authority
to make any decisions.


96
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.485
I see. Well, it's getting pretty late,
so I think we should go to the front desk.


97
00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:34.568
Let's go. I'll be right back, hon.

98
00:11:36.485 --> 00:11:39.777
It won't take long, cutie pie.
Watch the kids.


99
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.985
Excuse us. Good night.

100
00:12:49.652 --> 00:12:50.735
Sir?

101
00:12:52.152 --> 00:12:54.235
- Sir?
- Yes?


102
00:12:55.735 --> 00:13:00.735
Are you enrolled
in our timeshare information seminar?


103
00:13:01.152 --> 00:13:02.485
Yes. So?

104
00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.152
Is there a problem?

105
00:13:07.068 --> 00:13:08.318
You too, sir?

106
00:13:09.902 --> 00:13:11.443
I'll take them to Moises.

107
00:13:12.902 --> 00:13:14.402
Follow me, please.

108
00:15:46.818 --> 00:15:47.860
Ma'am.

109
00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:06.443
Hey, you.

110
00:16:16.152 --> 00:16:19.068
They told us we
had to sit by color.

111
00:16:20.068 --> 00:16:22.568
- Who said that?
- The memo.


112
00:16:23.527 --> 00:16:24.902
Who is Memo?

113
00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.318
Hi, hello. Good evening.

114
00:16:28.402 --> 00:16:30.443
Good evening.

115
00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:34.818
Crew, this is your captain speaking.

116
00:16:36.193 --> 00:16:38.735
Let's show our new owners

117
00:16:39.318 --> 00:16:45.110
that we take organization seriously
here at Vistamar.


118
00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:48.277
I'm very pleased to inform you

119
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.985
that as of today, we'll be part

120
00:16:52.068 --> 00:16:56.777
of the Everfields
International Resorts family.


121
00:16:57.777 --> 00:16:59.443
From now on,

122
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.485
our mission is to make dreams come true.

123
00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.693
Before I move on,

124
00:17:09.193 --> 00:17:13.527
I would like to acknowledge
two very special members of our team,


125
00:17:14.318 --> 00:17:19.360
who have inspired us all
with their positive attitude.


126
00:17:19.443 --> 00:17:24.527
Dear Gloria, Andres, please stand up.

127
00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:31.443
Dear friends, your example...

128
00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:38.652
is an inspiration for our great future.

129
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.193
Please, a round of applause
to Gloria and Andres.


130
00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.318
- Our manager will be with you shortly.
- OK.


131
00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:20.235
- Like some water?
- No, it's fine.


132
00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:22.860
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.


133
00:18:22.943 --> 00:18:25.943
- Right away.
- Hey, what time is it?


134
00:18:27.693 --> 00:18:30.777
Of course. And I have more.
I'll give them to you in a second.


135
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.235
Good morning, Mr. Alvarez.

136
00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:35.860
Morning? Already? 
What time is it?

137
00:18:36.527 --> 00:18:42.277
May I offer you my sincere apologies
on behalf of Everfields International


138
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.318
for this shaky start
to your vacation's experience.


139
00:18:47.027 --> 00:18:51.152
From now on, paradise is within reach.

140
00:18:52.568 --> 00:18:54.568
I have no idea what you just said.

141
00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:58.902
Could you fix the problem?
Is he getting his own villa?


142
00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:02.360
Mr. Bonilla is completely satisfied
with our arrangement.


143
00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:03.860
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

144
00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:06.568
I asked for coffee.

145
00:19:06.652 --> 00:19:11.610
Unfortunately, I can't share with you
the terms of Mr. Abel's deal.


146
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.318
- Really? Why?
- It's a matter of confidentiality.


147
00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:20.152
It's fine. I only want to know
how you'll get me the villa I paid for.


148
00:19:20.235 --> 00:19:23.277
We know that our customers use their rooms

149
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.318
almost exclusively for sleeping.

150
00:19:27.402 --> 00:19:31.068
And your villa can fit two families.

151
00:19:31.652 --> 00:19:34.485
Well, I don't care
if it fits 50 families.

152
00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:38.402
I paid for a
private villa for my family.

153
00:19:38.485 --> 00:19:39.902
Do you have a napkin?

154
00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:44.568
Look, mister. I'm really tired.
My flight was delayed two hours.


155
00:19:45.027 --> 00:19:47.152
The trip from the airport was exhausting.

156
00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:51.860
I want you to tell me what you'll do
to get me the villa I paid for.


157
00:19:51.943 --> 00:19:55.235
The villa was practically free
thanks to our generous offer...


158
00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:59.193
So what? Does that make me
a second-class customer?


159
00:19:59.652 --> 00:20:05.318
Absolutely not, Mr. Alvarez.
You deserve an international experience.


160
00:20:05.402 --> 00:20:08.652
Unfortunately,
we don't have any vacancies.


161
00:20:08.735 --> 00:20:13.402
- Why?
- Because our offer was a great success.


162
00:20:16.485 --> 00:20:18.777
You overbooked your rooms, Moises.

163
00:20:19.943 --> 00:20:23.527
- That's illegal.
- It isn't if it's the result of success.


164
00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:29.235
And him? What did you offer him
that made him so happy?


165
00:20:30.277 --> 00:20:31.693
Paradise.

166
00:20:32.652 --> 00:20:34.860
Are you making fun of me?

167
00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.943
Do I look stupid to you?
Do I look like I'm in paradise?


168
00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:39.902
- Are you making fun of me?
- Absolutely not...


169
00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:45.402
- Stop goofing around and solve this!
- Mr. Alvarez, please. Show him.


170
00:20:49.068 --> 00:20:50.152
What's that?

171
00:20:50.235 --> 00:20:53.735
An agreement.
You can trust us as if we were family.


172
00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:06.693
This has to be
a joke. It can't be.

173
00:21:07.193 --> 00:21:08.777
Look, I only get
one week off a year

174
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.402
and you don't know
how important this is to my family.


175
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.443
I want to have the vacation
I paid for today.


176
00:21:15.527 --> 00:21:18.527
And I'm not signing anything that lets you
off the hook from your mistake.


177
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.485
Nor anything that won't guarantee
my family's privacy.


178
00:21:21.818 --> 00:21:26.318
May I offer you my sincere apologies
on behalf of Everfields International.


179
00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:41.402
- Eva, what happened?
- You startled me!


180
00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:44.277
What happened with the room?
Why are they sleeping there?


181
00:21:44.985 --> 00:21:46.777
Can I make myself a cup of coffee?

182
00:22:06.277 --> 00:22:08.610
I'll try to find instant coffee.

183
00:22:10.068 --> 00:22:11.068
OK.

184
00:22:12.818 --> 00:22:15.068
So, what happened with the room?

185
00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:22.818
I don't know. What can I say?
I felt bad. There's four of them.


186
00:22:22.902 --> 00:22:25.152
Their kids wouldn't fit on the sofa bed.

187
00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:28.610
- Besides, it's just for one night.
- No, it's not only for a night.


188
00:22:28.693 --> 00:22:30.527
- What do you mean?
- They're staying here.


189
00:22:33.443 --> 00:22:36.527
They overbooked the villa
and they don't care that it's illegal.


190
00:22:39.443 --> 00:22:40.443
We have to share.

191
00:22:47.652 --> 00:22:50.027
- Want to go to another hotel?
- There's none available.


192
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.610
Everything's full
and what's available is really expensive.


193
00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:56.777
It's the peak of the season.

194
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.110
Besides, why should we leave?
I paid for this.


195
00:22:59.193 --> 00:23:01.985
It is paid for. 
I have already paid.

196
00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:05.277
There's nothing else. 
I paid for it.

197
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.568
Honey, it's OK.

198
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.277
We'll just stay all day in the pool.

199
00:23:17.318 --> 00:23:18.318
Yeah.

200
00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:31.443
Thanks for taking it like this.
In your stride.


201
00:23:32.402 --> 00:23:34.527
I would be much worse
if it wasn't for you.


202
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.360
It is what it is. There were nine others
with me at the clinic. You get used to it.


203
00:23:41.693 --> 00:23:44.902
Besides, Raton really likes those kids.
It'll be good for him.


204
00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:46.443
Are you crazy?

205
00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:49.068
We're not spending time with those people.

206
00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:53.318
- They're here.
- And? Raton's IQ will drop.


207
00:23:53.402 --> 00:23:54.860
We'll keep it to the minimum.

208
00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:18.568
All that junk is how they got that idiot
to sign the agreement.


209
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.735
He signed a paper
saying everything was OK


210
00:24:21.818 --> 00:24:23.735
because they gave him that crap.

211
00:24:24.443 --> 00:24:26.860
I'm getting a month for free. You'll see.

212
00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:27.943
How?

213
00:24:28.485 --> 00:24:30.902
- Why are you laughing?
- Why?


214
00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:33.402
- It's not funny.
- Why not?


215
00:24:44.443 --> 00:24:46.443
- Here you go, Sebas.
- Everything OK?


216
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:47.527
Yes.

217
00:24:51.527 --> 00:24:55.027
Peak season is starting.

218
00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:57.485
You know the saying,

219
00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:02.360
"Never put off till tomorrow
what you can do today."


220
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.443
Forget about "later."

221
00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:18.860
Do you want a balloon, Raton?

222
00:26:19.235 --> 00:26:23.068
- Welcome. Here you are, a balloon.
- Thank you.


223
00:26:25.277 --> 00:26:26.610
Don't let go of it.

224
00:26:57.027 --> 00:26:58.360
Come here, son.

225
00:27:01.902 --> 00:27:05.152
All right, everybody,
follow the instructor!


226
00:27:11.568 --> 00:27:12.568
Shall I tickle you?

227
00:27:17.277 --> 00:27:19.443
Everfields Vistamar!

228
00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:22.777
Turn around.

229
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.152
Ready.

230
00:27:30.943 --> 00:27:32.110
Shall we go dancing?

231
00:28:23.027 --> 00:28:26.068
Very good. Excellent.

232
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.485
What are you doing here, Andres?

233
00:31:04.235 --> 00:31:06.985
This seminar is invitation only.

234
00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:10.277
And you're making this hard for Gloria.

235
00:31:12.777 --> 00:31:16.693
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, of course.


236
00:31:16.777 --> 00:31:21.985
But there are many reasons
I should be part of this seminar.


237
00:31:22.068 --> 00:31:24.527
I'm a hard worker.

238
00:31:25.318 --> 00:31:29.152
I do my job really well.
I've been employee of the month 14 times...


239
00:31:29.235 --> 00:31:30.902
- Andres.
- I'm a natural leader.


240
00:31:30.985 --> 00:31:33.943
- I do what I'm told.
- I didn't make the call.


241
00:31:34.693 --> 00:31:40.152
Headquarters did. In Tucson, Arizona.

242
00:31:40.235 --> 00:31:43.485
I didn't have anything to do with it.
I barely had a say.


243
00:31:51.652 --> 00:31:54.693
- Excuse me, what's that?
- BBQ ribs, sir.


244
00:32:01.652 --> 00:32:02.943
Want mashed potatoes, Raton?

245
00:32:21.943 --> 00:32:25.235
Buddy! Buddy! We saved you some seats.

246
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.902
- Don't even think about it.
- Honey, they've already seen us.


247
00:32:30.985 --> 00:32:33.902
And there's nowhere else to sit.
Do you want us to eat on our feet?


248
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.527
OK, let's go, then.

249
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.860
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon.


250
00:32:45.943 --> 00:32:47.568
- Hi.
- Did you sleep well?


251
00:32:48.152 --> 00:32:49.735
- Yeah.
- Good.


252
00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:56.428
Didn't know there were waiters.
I thought this was a buffet.


253
00:32:57.443 --> 00:33:01.568
This table is VIP, buddy, VIP.

254
00:33:09.818 --> 00:33:11.527
You guys are really smart.

255
00:33:12.235 --> 00:33:16.693
Look at my little Abelines,
they're all burnt and red.


256
00:33:17.402 --> 00:33:19.068
I burnt my mouth.

257
00:33:19.777 --> 00:33:22.110
I'm gonna have to borrow
that sunscreen, Evis.


258
00:33:22.193 --> 00:33:24.360
Of course, Sara. 
Whatever you need.

259
00:33:24.443 --> 00:33:26.443
We'll buy one after brunch, cutie pie.

260
00:33:27.277 --> 00:33:28.943
Don't worry about it.

261
00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:34.402
Good afternoon. Are you enjoying
your complimentary brunch?


262
00:33:34.485 --> 00:33:36.068
- Yes!
- Good.


263
00:33:36.152 --> 00:33:40.152
I want you to have a look
at these brochures here.


264
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:43.027
You can find all our destinations.

265
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:49.027
The Everfields family has just got bigger,
and we want you to be part of it


266
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:53.443
so we can provide you with all the health
and well-being you deserve.


267
00:33:53.527 --> 00:33:57.360
We can adapt to
any life plan you require.

268
00:33:57.735 --> 00:34:03.402
So rest assured, our main goal
is to share this paradise with you.


269
00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:08.485
So, give it a read,
and I'm here if you have any questions.


270
00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:10.360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


271
00:34:10.443 --> 00:34:12.402
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.


272
00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:14.235
Buddy.

273
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.443
I'm fine, thank you.

274
00:34:26.568 --> 00:34:29.027
Eva, you should have some more,
you're so skinny.


275
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.777
Have a steak,
chicken makes you lose weight.


276
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.568
I had a really big breakfast,
so I'm not hungry.


277
00:34:36.943 --> 00:34:40.235
- So, what are you doing this afternoon?
- The kids are going swimming.


278
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.068
- They say there's a beautiful cenote.
- Really?


279
00:34:45.152 --> 00:34:48.235
- We're going. Right, kids?
- Dad, what's that?


280
00:34:48.318 --> 00:34:52.277
A cenote is a small lake
that is inside the cave.


281
00:34:53.652 --> 00:34:56.902
- Can we go to the natural well?
- Do you want to?


282
00:34:56.985 --> 00:35:01.360
I'm not sure, son. It is kind of dangerous
and you're not a strong swimmer yet.


283
00:35:01.443 --> 00:35:04.902
We also have tickets for the water slide.
We can skip the line.


284
00:35:06.527 --> 00:35:10.443
Cenote, cenote, cenote.

285
00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:15.652
Cenote, cenote, cenote.

286
00:35:15.735 --> 00:35:18.610
- Raton! Raton!
- Cenote. Cenote.


287
00:35:18.693 --> 00:35:20.152
Cenote.

288
00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:22.485
Raton!

289
00:35:23.818 --> 00:35:26.443
Raton, stop it!

290
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.110
Calm down, buddy.
We're just playing around.


291
00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.027
How are you feeling?

292
00:35:36.818 --> 00:35:37.818
Fine.

293
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.443
Better.

294
00:35:44.693 --> 00:35:48.610
I'm trying to stay positive all the time.

295
00:35:52.443 --> 00:35:55.068
I'm reading one of those books

296
00:35:55.152 --> 00:36:00.818
that help you see things
in a positive light.


297
00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:09.277
I'm trying to do a good job
and set an example.


298
00:36:10.277 --> 00:36:12.860
Especially for our new co-workers.

299
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.402
I'm sure
that I'll be lowering my dose soon.


300
00:36:19.735 --> 00:36:22.193
It is important
that you don't stop your treatment.


301
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.443
How are things at home?

302
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.902
Good.

303
00:36:28.693 --> 00:36:33.693
Gloria, my wife,
well, she's not very expressive.


304
00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.610
She is really happy
with the American boss.


305
00:36:40.152 --> 00:36:43.568
How would you say you've performed
since our previous evaluation?


306
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.152
Well, I think...

307
00:36:50.443 --> 00:36:52.777
I'm doing everything I can...

308
00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:56.735
to adjust to all the changes.

309
00:36:59.527 --> 00:37:02.360
I mean, our new bosses.

310
00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:09.027
- Have you had any other visions?
- No.


311
00:37:10.527 --> 00:37:13.485
I think this time,
we found the right combination.


312
00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.193
How was your day?

313
00:38:06.568 --> 00:38:07.568
Good.

314
00:38:09.402 --> 00:38:11.068
The seminar is really good.

315
00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.402
I'm very tired.

316
00:38:19.485 --> 00:38:21.818
I could really use a vacation.

317
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.735
I'm looking for one
of those "international experiences."


318
00:38:33.693 --> 00:38:37.652
I know someone who's selling them.

319
00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:40.277
She can give me a discount.

320
00:38:42.068 --> 00:38:43.402
Keep dreaming.

321
00:38:46.652 --> 00:38:48.277
It's my opportunity.

322
00:38:53.193 --> 00:38:56.318
- It could be ours.
- Why yours?


323
00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.068
What have you done to deserve it?

324
00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:02.360
They owe me.

325
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.652
Nobody owes you anything.

326
00:39:07.693 --> 00:39:09.027
It's a new hotel.

327
00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:12.193
And that is done.

328
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.152
Everfields only cares about the future.

329
00:39:16.818 --> 00:39:18.610
What about our future?

330
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.818
Aren't we a family anymore?

331
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.193
Can't you see that everything has changed?

332
00:39:36.318 --> 00:39:39.610
The hotel has changed.
You have changed and so have I.


333
00:39:43.943 --> 00:39:45.318
He's gone.

334
00:39:49.068 --> 00:39:51.318
If you don't adapt, you'll be left behind.

335
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:02.610
Pedro.

336
00:41:04.777 --> 00:41:05.777
Pedro.

337
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.943
Pedro, quit it!

338
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.193
Do you want me to ground you?

339
00:41:12.568 --> 00:41:14.488
What have I told you
about running near the pool?


340
00:41:15.193 --> 00:41:16.527
I'm talking to you.

341
00:41:17.568 --> 00:41:19.068
Don't yell.

342
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.235
This guy's really talented.

343
00:41:33.235 --> 00:41:36.527
Getting so far ahead in life
and without parents.


344
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:37.652
What happened to them?

345
00:41:38.277 --> 00:41:41.235
They died in a car crash
when he was just a baby.


346
00:41:41.318 --> 00:41:44.360
Are you going to be here much longer?
I'm really tired.


347
00:41:44.443 --> 00:41:46.652
Honey, can we finish watching this show?

348
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.193
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you, honey.


349
00:44:11.027 --> 00:44:13.527
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

350
00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:17.152
Right...

351
00:46:14.235 --> 00:46:18.068
- How was the pool? Very good, right?
- But it was too crowded.


352
00:46:18.152 --> 00:46:19.318
It's always like that.

353
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:22.402
But I saw you guys
were in a private area.

354
00:46:22.485 --> 00:46:26.277
We had to make a reservation
the day before.


355
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.068
You should've come too.

356
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:37.860
We found a good supermarket nearby.
I mean, the prices were OK.


357
00:46:38.485 --> 00:46:39.568
Hey, buddy!

358
00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:42.027
What were you dreaming of?

359
00:46:44.527 --> 00:46:48.027
Good morning.
Would you like some breakfast?


360
00:46:50.527 --> 00:46:52.485
Instant coffee, please.

361
00:46:58.027 --> 00:47:00.693
- How are you?
- Fine. I just have a headache.


362
00:47:03.193 --> 00:47:05.568
- I don't want to stay with them anymore.
- Don't be rude.


363
00:47:05.652 --> 00:47:07.110
- Rude? How?
- They're here.


364
00:47:07.193 --> 00:47:08.235
So what?

365
00:47:09.485 --> 00:47:11.568
This vacation is just for us, hon.

366
00:47:11.652 --> 00:47:15.360
We came here to heal. They are ruining it.
We're already sharing the villa.


367
00:47:15.443 --> 00:47:17.527
- Why be with them all day?
- This is good for us.


368
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.568
- How is it good for us?
- Can't you see?


369
00:47:19.652 --> 00:47:22.568
- What?
- Raton is really happy.


370
00:47:22.652 --> 00:47:25.943
- Pedro is happy everywhere.
- It's nice having grown-ups I can talk to.


371
00:47:26.027 --> 00:47:29.068
Grown-ups? Please! What can you
talk about with them? They're...


372
00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:32.985
- Please make an effort.
- You don't think I've been doing that?


373
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.360
Why don't you stay here today? Rest.

374
00:47:36.443 --> 00:47:39.193
Stop telling me what to do.
I'm not the one who's sick.


375
00:47:42.402 --> 00:47:44.485
Daddy, can I swim in the pool?

376
00:47:44.568 --> 00:47:47.777
- You just had breakfast.
- Please. Please.


377
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.527
- Ask your mom.
- Of course you can, honey.


378
00:48:03.568 --> 00:48:05.152
It took them long enough.

379
00:48:07.527 --> 00:48:08.568
Excuse me?

380
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.402
It doesn't make sense for you
to attend English classes.


381
00:48:12.485 --> 00:48:13.902
I saw your name on the list.

382
00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:20.485
- I just want to improve.
- What for?


383
00:48:22.652 --> 00:48:23.943
I don't know.

384
00:48:25.693 --> 00:48:29.818
- I just don't want to lag behind.
- We're a liability to them.


385
00:48:31.527 --> 00:48:34.943
Even if you learned Chinese,
how long have you worked for this company?


386
00:48:36.652 --> 00:48:38.277
Down here?

387
00:48:39.318 --> 00:48:41.152
Four years, maybe less.

388
00:48:42.068 --> 00:48:44.443
You've been here in the gutter
for a long time.


389
00:48:44.985 --> 00:48:47.818
You can't leave
until you've become waste...


390
00:48:49.485 --> 00:48:50.818
or until you are spared.

391
00:48:53.943 --> 00:48:56.443
That's the only exit.

392
00:52:09.527 --> 00:52:10.527
Gloria.

393
00:54:52.318 --> 00:54:53.818
Gloria is already with them.

394
00:54:54.985 --> 00:54:56.235
And you know it.

395
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:03.693
Follow me.

396
00:55:22.193 --> 00:55:25.318
- Where did you get this from?
- Put it away. Quick.


397
00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:30.152
That's the key for you
to give them all wrong numbers.


398
00:55:32.193 --> 00:55:33.568
Wrong numbers?

399
00:55:34.818 --> 00:55:38.610
All of this is a test
before they come for real.


400
00:55:38.693 --> 00:55:40.373
They'll leave if they don't sell anything.

401
00:55:41.943 --> 00:55:43.527
Should I be scared?

402
00:55:44.277 --> 00:55:47.193
Shouldn't they be scared instead?

403
00:56:08.527 --> 00:56:10.235
Hey. Here.

404
00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.568
Welcome, guys. How are you?

405
00:56:15.318 --> 00:56:17.485
- I'm Sergio.
- Nice to meet you.


406
00:56:17.568 --> 00:56:20.943
Oh, new aces. How are you? What's up?

407
00:56:21.027 --> 00:56:22.027
Hi.

408
00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:24.568
- How's it going?
- How are you?


409
00:56:25.443 --> 00:56:28.485
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?
- Fine.


410
00:56:28.568 --> 00:56:31.777
Awesome. So, let's warm up.

411
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.485
Who here has played tennis before?

412
00:56:35.777 --> 00:56:40.902
Awesome. So, let's go to court number four
and get started.


413
00:56:41.652 --> 00:56:44.068
OK, Champ. This is a drive.

414
00:56:44.152 --> 00:56:47.610
I lift my hand to the back of my head,
I hit at the front and I put a scarf on.


415
00:56:51.193 --> 00:56:54.610
- Could you aim that closer to me?
- You want it closer?


416
00:56:58.027 --> 00:56:59.152
What happened?

417
00:57:00.568 --> 00:57:03.027
Come on, son. You can do it.
Come on, come on!


418
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:06.318
What an asshole.
I can't believe he is with her.


419
00:57:06.902 --> 00:57:08.027
Let's go.

420
00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:12.610
Great arm. Good job!

421
00:57:16.735 --> 00:57:18.152
You can do it, player.

422
00:57:20.818 --> 00:57:22.152
That's it.

423
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.610
Amazing! Spectacular!

424
00:57:29.318 --> 00:57:30.485
Come on!

425
00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:33.193
Yes!

426
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.777
- That's it.
- Since when do you play tennis?


427
00:57:37.443 --> 00:57:40.110
I played for a
while when I was 15.

428
00:57:40.193 --> 00:57:42.235
That's it. Spectacular!

429
00:57:42.318 --> 00:57:45.068
- Cool!
- You never told me that.


430
00:57:45.152 --> 00:57:47.027
Very good! Very good!

431
00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:48.902
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.


432
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.735
- Go.
- Are you OK?


433
00:57:53.193 --> 00:57:54.777
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.


434
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.860
Good.

435
00:57:56.985 --> 00:57:58.652
Bravo!

436
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:00.402
That's my boy!

437
00:58:01.402 --> 00:58:02.818
OK, beautiful.

438
00:58:04.818 --> 00:58:07.360
Good. A little higher.

439
00:58:09.443 --> 00:58:11.860
Very good! Next.

440
00:58:13.152 --> 00:58:17.027
Dude, remember, eyes on the ball. Focus.

441
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.485
Hit it this time, OK?

442
00:58:20.985 --> 00:58:22.277
What's wrong with you?

443
00:58:23.568 --> 00:58:25.693
- What happened?
- Could you hit it again, please?


444
00:58:25.777 --> 00:58:26.777
No. Next one, please.

445
00:58:26.818 --> 00:58:30.693
- The rules are the same for everyone.
- But you're hitting wrong!


446
00:58:30.777 --> 00:58:32.943
- Do you want another shot?
- Yes, please.


447
00:58:33.027 --> 00:58:36.277
- So, you're like an expert?
- Smile, buddy!


448
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:37.610
For Facebook.

449
00:58:43.693 --> 00:58:45.443
Let me see, hon. 
Move your hands.

450
00:58:45.527 --> 00:58:49.902
Calm down. It's OK, let me see.

451
00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:54.027
Pedro? Look at me.
Please, call an ambulance!


452
00:59:11.902 --> 00:59:14.860
Easy, buddy. Calm down.
Everything is fine.


453
00:59:14.943 --> 00:59:15.943
Where am I?

454
00:59:16.027 --> 00:59:21.193
Easy, easy now.
Our families went home already.


455
00:59:21.277 --> 00:59:25.068
Such a shame. You really scared us.

456
00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:28.360
Why are you here? Why?

457
00:59:28.443 --> 00:59:31.777
Your wife fainted
because you bled heavily.


458
00:59:32.943 --> 00:59:37.110
She wasn't of any use to you.
It was better she went home.


459
00:59:37.193 --> 00:59:39.110
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.


460
00:59:39.193 --> 00:59:44.902
Don't you worry, buddy.
This is a first-class clinic.


461
00:59:48.943 --> 00:59:52.443
- Don Abel, nice to see you.
- How are you, Doc?


462
00:59:52.527 --> 00:59:55.152
- Very good, and you?
- How's my buddy doing?


463
00:59:55.235 --> 00:59:57.360
He broke his nose.

464
00:59:57.943 --> 01:00:02.235
Is this the first
time he broke his nose?

465
01:00:02.652 --> 01:00:06.360
No. He broke his nose when he was a kid.
He was 11.


466
01:00:06.443 --> 01:00:09.527
- How did you know?
- It didn't heal properly.


467
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:13.443
- Why?
- He should rest as much as he can.


468
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.568
And keep him out of the sun.

469
01:00:16.652 --> 01:00:19.318
Perfect. Will do.
Anything else he might need?


470
01:00:19.402 --> 01:00:22.777
I'm giving him some pills.

471
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.235
He should take one and a half
in the morning and at night.


472
01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:29.652
Perfect. Is that it?

473
01:00:29.735 --> 01:00:32.402
Well, we're here if you need anything.

474
01:00:33.277 --> 01:00:37.068
- It's my pleasure to treat you.
- See, buddy? Let's go home.


475
01:00:37.152 --> 01:00:40.527
Careful. Take it slowly.

476
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:42.860
Slowly. Come on.

477
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:52.527
Wait here, buddy. 
I'm getting your meds.

478
01:01:23.985 --> 01:01:26.235
We have to be silent,
otherwise we'll wake them up.


479
01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:28.110
Not so loud.

480
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.693
Be careful.

481
01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:38.485
- Oh, honey.
- I'm OK, it's fine.


482
01:01:38.568 --> 01:01:41.277
It's not too bad. He's OK.

483
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.610
- Did they give him something?
- A sedative.


484
01:01:45.193 --> 01:01:46.860
Careful, buddy.

485
01:01:53.818 --> 01:01:55.235
Don't get too worried, sis.

486
01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:58.735
The doctor said
it's not as bad as it looks.


487
01:02:06.527 --> 01:02:08.068
Is he going to need surgery?

488
01:02:08.152 --> 01:02:11.277
No, no, no. Not right now.
We'll have to see later on.


489
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.985
Right now, he needs to rest
and stay out of the sun.


490
01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:16.485
Lay down.

491
01:02:23.068 --> 01:02:24.985
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.


492
01:02:29.568 --> 01:02:32.527
- I'm taking your shirt off.
- No. I'm fine.


493
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.735
- It's soaked in blood.
- Doesn't matter.


494
01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.443
He really scared us all.

495
01:02:47.193 --> 01:02:50.652
- How much was it?
- Don't you worry about it.


496
01:02:50.735 --> 01:02:53.693
We took care of the bill.
That's what family's for.


497
01:02:54.652 --> 01:02:57.943
Enjoy. Relax.
We'll swim in the sea after this.


498
01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:03.860
- We can't leave him alone, can we?
- It's best for him. He needs to rest.


499
01:03:03.943 --> 01:03:07.610
If you lock yourselves up,
he'll become very anxious.


500
01:03:07.693 --> 01:03:09.152
He's going to worry about you.

501
01:03:10.693 --> 01:03:12.068
Try to get some sleep.

502
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.610
Don't worry, buddy.

503
01:03:19.443 --> 01:03:23.277
I'll make sure your wife and your Raton
have a great time.


504
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.568
Good night. Thank you very much.

505
01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:27.735
Good night. Sleep well.

506
01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:38.527
Not long ago, my husband and I suffered...

507
01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.943
- a terrible tragedy.
- Good evening.


508
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.652
Let's have a break.

509
01:03:56.902 --> 01:03:59.943
Pull yourself together
and we'll start over.


510
01:04:06.193 --> 01:04:11.402
You have a really good story.

511
01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:17.943
Make it yours and it will be the best tool
in your arsenal.


512
01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:23.610
I've been trying to overcome this
for so many years.


513
01:04:24.568 --> 01:04:27.360
The best of us

514
01:04:27.777 --> 01:04:32.485
take our personal tragedies

515
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.985
and turn them into opportunities

516
01:04:39.485 --> 01:04:41.527
for success.

517
01:04:43.235 --> 01:04:48.527
You are meant to be one of us.

518
01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:55.443
Shall we try it again?

519
01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:05.860
When my Rogelio went to heaven...

520
01:05:07.985 --> 01:05:11.527
my husband and I had many problems.

521
01:05:15.652 --> 01:05:18.318
We almost gave up, but...

522
01:05:19.652 --> 01:05:21.068
our family,

523
01:05:22.193 --> 01:05:25.027
the Vistamar family...

524
01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.068
The Everfields family.

525
01:05:29.818 --> 01:05:32.985
"The Everfields family."

526
01:07:31.652 --> 01:07:32.652
What's up?

527
01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:39.735
- Mommy, can we watch a film?
- No, honey, Daddy is resting.


528
01:07:39.818 --> 01:07:41.527
- Please.
- No, honey.


529
01:07:43.735 --> 01:07:46.193
I think Pedrito
needs someone to play with.


530
01:07:46.277 --> 01:07:50.610
- Only children grow up spoiled. Twisted.
- Yeah.


531
01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:54.193
- He's very lonely.
- Lots of kids without siblings are fine.


532
01:07:54.277 --> 01:07:57.277
It's awful.
How can everything collapse so quickly?


533
01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.693
Don't worry. It's just a broken nose.

534
01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:02.193
But if something were to happen to him,
I would die!


535
01:08:02.943 --> 01:08:04.735
I don't know what Raton would do.

536
01:08:04.818 --> 01:08:09.110
We aren't worried,
because our kids have each other.


537
01:08:09.193 --> 01:08:11.360
They keep each other company.

538
01:08:11.443 --> 01:08:15.943
Pedrito deserves that,
having someone who'll always be with him.


539
01:08:16.027 --> 01:08:18.027
You still have time.

540
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:21.152
The best gift you can give him
is more children.


541
01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:22.818
A baby brother.

542
01:08:23.318 --> 01:08:26.277
There's nothing worse
than being alone in this world.


543
01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:31.818
Yes, sis, but you're not alone.

544
01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:36.860
I mean, you have us.
And I know we've just met, but...


545
01:08:38.277 --> 01:08:39.360
I don't know.

546
01:08:39.443 --> 01:08:44.443
There's something about this place
that is like magic, isn't there?


547
01:08:44.527 --> 01:08:45.902
To us,

548
01:08:45.985 --> 01:08:50.985
you've become part of our family.

549
01:08:51.318 --> 01:08:54.068
- Abel.
- I feel the same way, Evis.


550
01:08:57.068 --> 01:08:59.652
I'm fine, Eva. Don't worry.

551
01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:00.943
Thank you...

552
01:09:02.485 --> 01:09:04.568
for helping me heal.

553
01:09:05.527 --> 01:09:07.985
- Sis.
- It's never too late, Eva.


554
01:09:08.568 --> 01:09:09.777
It's never too late.

555
01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:53.318
Pedrito.

556
01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:55.652
Sweetie.

557
01:09:57.443 --> 01:10:00.443
I need you to wake up.
I have something to tell you.


558
01:10:02.402 --> 01:10:06.110
What's the matter?
Don't worry, love. Everything's fine.


559
01:10:07.568 --> 01:10:08.902
I need you to listen,

560
01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:11.402
because I have something important
to tell you, OK?


561
01:10:13.318 --> 01:10:16.818
You know I'm your dad, right?

562
01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:21.943
Abel and the rest, they're not our family.

563
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.777
They're bad people.

564
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.402
Do you remember that game we played?
"Impostors"? That's who they are.


565
01:10:29.943 --> 01:10:32.318
They're bad people
who want to break us apart.


566
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.110
And you know
that I love you very much, right?


567
01:10:37.443 --> 01:10:40.443
And you know
that I'm never leaving you alone?


568
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:47.985
And you know
that I'll always be with you, right?


569
01:10:48.068 --> 01:10:51.402
Mom and I are
your only family. That's it.

570
01:10:52.652 --> 01:10:55.068
Not them. OK?

571
01:10:55.485 --> 01:11:00.943
We have to be very smart, you and I.
So they won't hurt us.


572
01:11:49.902 --> 01:11:55.193
I won the lottery! 
I won the lottery!

573
01:11:55.277 --> 01:12:00.318
It's mine! I'm a millionaire!
I'm free and I'm a millionaire!


574
01:12:00.777 --> 01:12:06.027
It's mine! I won the lottery!

575
01:12:57.068 --> 01:13:01.735
PERSONAL FILE

576
01:14:20.777 --> 01:14:21.777
Hello.

577
01:14:36.068 --> 01:14:37.110
Who are you?

578
01:14:38.985 --> 01:14:40.277
I'm Andres.

579
01:15:06.485 --> 01:15:10.068
What's this? Who gave you this?
Where did you get this from?


580
01:15:10.485 --> 01:15:15.360
Gloria, my wife. She works in sales.
Your family is one of her targets.


581
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:24.152
They only want to sell.

582
01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:30.860
No, this isn't right. 
My wife is sick.

583
01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.652
I lost her for a year.

584
01:15:34.568 --> 01:15:38.152
She was committed for a year.
They can't use this information!


585
01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:42.527
At tonight's presentation,

586
01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:44.568
give them wrong numbers.

587
01:15:44.902 --> 01:15:47.568
It's all they care about.

588
01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:50.443
I'm not going to the presentation.

589
01:15:50.527 --> 01:15:52.735
I'm taking them away.

590
01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:54.777
I'm taking them with me.

591
01:15:55.443 --> 01:15:56.693
I'm taking them with me.

592
01:15:56.777 --> 01:15:59.193
But they have your family in their pocket.

593
01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:01.985
They will not leave willingly.

594
01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:06.360
If you take them away,
they'll turn against you.


595
01:16:06.443 --> 01:16:09.360
And then you'll do anything
to win them back.


596
01:16:09.818 --> 01:16:14.152
You'll buy a membership
and then there's no turning back.


597
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.777
And who are you? Andres who?

598
01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:22.610
Why are you doing this?

599
01:16:26.402 --> 01:16:29.568
I want to take something away from them
so they see what it feels like.


600
01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:44.318
A great vacation always gives us memories
of the time we spent with our family.


601
01:17:44.402 --> 01:17:50.402
But it's also an opportunity to inspire us
on the path towards success.


602
01:17:50.943 --> 01:17:54.152
Our family is not offering you a villa.

603
01:17:54.527 --> 01:17:59.068
Our family is giving you
the gift of inspiration.


604
01:18:00.652 --> 01:18:03.527
Please, close your eyes for a moment.

605
01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:09.902
Picture yourselves
as the owner of one of our villas.


606
01:18:11.027 --> 01:18:13.568
Your wife is opening a bottle of wine
from our cellar,


607
01:18:14.527 --> 01:18:17.652
and you toast with a picture-perfect
sunset in the background


608
01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:20.818
while your children
are happily playing in the pool,


609
01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360
as they do every year.

610
01:18:25.235 --> 01:18:28.068
Focus on your heart.

611
01:18:31.152 --> 01:18:34.485
Can you feel your family's love?

612
01:18:37.652 --> 01:18:38.777
Open your eyes.

613
01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:43.360
That's what paradise feels like.

614
01:18:43.443 --> 01:18:46.568
And that's what Everfields
is offering you.


615
01:18:46.652 --> 01:18:51.443
Unforgettable moments that inspire you
to make your dreams come true.


616
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:54.485
Any questions?

617
01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:56.777
Please.

618
01:18:57.735 --> 01:18:58.777
Thank you.

619
01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.818
Good evening, excuse me.

620
01:19:05.902 --> 01:19:08.985
I wanted to thank you

621
01:19:09.068 --> 01:19:13.735
for all these beautiful moments.

622
01:19:13.818 --> 01:19:19.818
We like to think that, in just a few days,
our family has grown.


623
01:19:19.902 --> 01:19:23.277
Like my wife always says,

624
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.443
"There's nothing in this world
like a big happy family."


625
01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:30.860
So, thank you very much.

626
01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:42.943
Thank you, Abel.

627
01:19:43.027 --> 01:19:44.777
We also believe that.

628
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.818
- Anyone else?
- Me.


629
01:19:47.193 --> 01:19:48.318
I have something to say.

630
01:19:49.027 --> 01:19:51.527
Hello, darling. Are you OK?

631
01:19:52.193 --> 01:19:55.943
- Sit down. I have something to say.
- Buddy.


632
01:19:56.568 --> 01:20:00.902
Hello. I don't have any questions,
I just want to say something.


633
01:20:00.985 --> 01:20:02.777
Sit, sit.

634
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.735
I just want to say
that dreams don't come true in this place.


635
01:20:06.818 --> 01:20:09.068
Nightmares do. 
Nightmares come true here.

636
01:20:09.152 --> 01:20:10.318
Yes, nightmares.

637
01:20:10.402 --> 01:20:16.402
And this, my face, is not the worst thing
that's happened to me in this place.


638
01:20:16.485 --> 01:20:18.235
- This is.
- Me?


639
01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:19.527
- This is.
- Pedro.


640
01:20:20.735 --> 01:20:21.735
This is the worst.

641
01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:25.360
This man wants to take my family
away from me.


642
01:20:25.443 --> 01:20:29.318
He broke my nose. It was him, Eva.

643
01:20:29.402 --> 01:20:33.943
You put him in my villa, you did,
and that's what happened.


644
01:20:34.027 --> 01:20:35.485
Thank you very much.

645
01:20:35.568 --> 01:20:40.027
- Please, let me be the first to apologize.
- No, you're not the first to apologize.


646
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:42.735
Everyone's been doing that,
but they don't do anything.


647
01:20:42.818 --> 01:20:44.193
Nobody's done a thing.

648
01:20:44.277 --> 01:20:47.777
I'm truly sorry, I think
this is a very unfortunate situation,


649
01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.193
but Mr. Bonilla had nothing to do...

650
01:20:50.277 --> 01:20:52.902
I'm sure that he had everything
to do with it


651
01:20:52.985 --> 01:20:54.777
and that he is working for you.

652
01:20:55.193 --> 01:20:57.527
Mr. Bonilla is a pawn, working for you.

653
01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:01.193
He's a pawn who made his way into my villa
to turn my family against me.


654
01:21:01.277 --> 01:21:04.860
And all because I wouldn't take
your shitty deal.


655
01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.652
Mr. Alvarez, we're incapable
of doing something like that!


656
01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:09.943
Really? And what's all this?

657
01:21:10.027 --> 01:21:14.943
My wife's clinical file.
With private photographs.


658
01:21:15.568 --> 01:21:18.068
You followed us
and you broke into my house.


659
01:21:18.152 --> 01:21:20.568
You violated my privacy.

660
01:21:20.652 --> 01:21:22.443
And you have pictures of us.

661
01:21:22.527 --> 01:21:25.068
These people treat us
like their guinea pigs.


662
01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:28.277
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- This! I told you!


663
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.777
They're not our friends.
They're trying to trick us.


664
01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.540
I told you.
Here's the evidence, all of it.


665
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.318
Don't listen to them
and don't drink anything they give you.


666
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.443
No, I trusted you once.

667
01:22:10.527 --> 01:22:13.527
I trusted this man and he mocked me.

668
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:16.360
He mocked my rights as a customer.

669
01:22:40.485 --> 01:22:43.860
- I told you, Eva. I fucking told you!
- Pedro! Pedro!


670
01:22:44.985 --> 01:22:46.485
You came here to heal.

671
01:22:50.318 --> 01:22:54.527
Do I look like I've healed?

672
01:22:55.652 --> 01:22:59.027
I know what it's like, struggling to heal.

673
01:23:00.027 --> 01:23:03.652
Look, my husband and I...

674
01:23:04.402 --> 01:23:07.193
saw our baby boy go to heaven.

675
01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:10.568
You don't know how hard it was.

676
01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:13.860
We felt very bad, I...

677
01:23:14.402 --> 01:23:19.068
I couldn't get out of bed.
I couldn't even leave the house.


678
01:23:19.985 --> 01:23:24.110
But the Everfields family helped me.

679
01:23:24.193 --> 01:23:27.652
They picked us up
and showed us that we could do it.


680
01:23:27.735 --> 01:23:33.735
We got back on our feet on the path
to success to make your dreams come true.


681
01:23:35.193 --> 01:23:37.360
Let us become your family.

682
01:23:37.943 --> 01:23:40.985
We'll be there for you. Always.

683
01:23:41.068 --> 01:23:43.610
We're going to give you a home
twice a year


684
01:23:43.693 --> 01:23:46.110
to protect you
from all that is wrong outside.


685
01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:52.818
You, Eva and your Raton.
We'll welcome all of you with open arms.


686
01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:55.610
Who do you think you are?
Calling my son that?


687
01:23:55.693 --> 01:23:57.943
Talking about him like that?

688
01:23:58.027 --> 01:23:59.735
You know nothing about family!

689
01:23:59.818 --> 01:24:03.277
What is Andres to you?
How is your husband doing?


690
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.693
Is he even part of your family?

691
01:24:04.777 --> 01:24:07.485
- You know Andres?
- Yes! You screwed him, just like me.


692
01:24:07.568 --> 01:24:10.068
You people fucked him. 
Made him crazy.

693
01:24:10.152 --> 01:24:12.693
You don't know what it's like.
Carrying someone.


694
01:24:13.027 --> 01:24:15.068
Yes, I do!

695
01:24:15.568 --> 01:24:16.652
And you don't give up.

696
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.568
You don't give up on your family.
You stay.


697
01:24:20.652 --> 01:24:22.943
You stay right there, with your family.

698
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.860
And you don't try to be someone else.

699
01:24:30.985 --> 01:24:35.402
This is not paradise.
Not for me. Not for you.


700
01:24:35.693 --> 01:24:36.693
Buddy.

701
01:24:38.027 --> 01:24:41.318
Don't you recognize us? 
We're your family.

702
01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.027
Calm down. Have a drink.

703
01:24:44.777 --> 01:24:47.818
Buddy, what are you doing? Let me go!

704
01:24:47.902 --> 01:24:49.402
Let go of me!

705
01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:52.735
You're the devil, asshole.
You're the devil!


706
01:24:52.818 --> 01:24:57.360
- You're the devil! Son of bitch!
- Pedro, stop it!


707
01:24:57.443 --> 01:24:59.277
You're the devil!

708
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:04.360
What's wrong with you?

709
01:25:07.152 --> 01:25:08.985
He's the devil.

710
01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:12.943
He's the devil.

711
01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.360
Why did you do it?

712
01:27:00.693 --> 01:27:02.443
It was my opportunity.

713
01:27:08.985 --> 01:27:10.443
I'm fed up.

714
01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:22.860
I can't stand you.

715
01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:30.277
You're not part of this family anymore.

716
01:28:58.527 --> 01:28:59.527
Eva.

717
01:29:42.943 --> 01:29:44.110
Hold it.
