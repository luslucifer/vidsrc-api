1
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:31.231
Two generals claim power. Lang wins
the war. Hatch hides in the shadows.


2
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:38.159
Once a year, on Liberation Day, victory
is celebrated. Many of Hatch's followers
are executed in public for treason.


3
00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:44.719
Unluckier ones end up in military prisons.

4
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.598
Rumors make the rounds, Hatch was
attacking those prisons to free his men.


5
00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:54.750
His whereabouts are unknown.

6
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:39.640
It's time! Fix this!

7
00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:42.875
- It's dead!
- Can you fix it?


8
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
We need him!

9
00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:12.255
Do you know how to fix this?

10
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:15.841
So fix it!

11
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:46.003
Back to work.

12
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:49.105
Back to work.

13
00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:33.654
Get down!

14
00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:45.532
Get down!

15
00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.293
Does anybody else

16
00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:35.825
want to try that?

17
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:31.681
You know who I am

18
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.018
and you're Gray Cortland's kid.

19
00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:41.417
Your father and I took down
three of Lang's prisons before ...


20
00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:44.682
This was the first one
we weren't prepared for.


21
00:07:47.644 --> 00:07:48.977
That fail safe device,

22
00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:50.938
it's just the start.

23
00:07:58.066 --> 00:07:59.999
This might hurt a little bit.

24
00:08:03.394 --> 00:08:04.594
Give me your head.

25
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.857
If we're gonna win this war,

26
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.177
I need information.

27
00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:26.590
What's that got to do with me?

28
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:28.170
It's on a ship.

29
00:08:28.194 --> 00:08:29.645
We're leaving tomorrow.

30
00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:32.037
You know it's systems.

31
00:08:35.563 --> 00:08:36.563
Do I?

32
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.148
The same class of ship you
flew in the elite guard.


33
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.083
They caught him, Kye.

34
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.110
Your father.

35
00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:50.414
They're gonna make an
example of him.


36
00:08:52.474 --> 00:08:53.474
Where is he?

37
00:08:54.404 --> 00:08:55.404
New Holland.

38
00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.412
On Liberation Day

39
00:08:57.865 --> 00:08:58.865
the axe falls.

40
00:08:59.982 --> 00:09:01.515
But I promise you, Kye.

41
00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:04.518
We can stop that axe from falling.

42
00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:17.114
Last time I saw my old man,
he had a 3 minute window to talk.


43
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.127
He was paranoid.

44
00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:23.481
He kept looking over his
shoulder every 15 seconds.


45
00:09:24.154 --> 00:09:26.420
Just in case he was being watched.

46
00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:31.117
Is that the kind of
guy you think I am?


47
00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:34.708
One who enjoys looking
over his shoulder?


48
00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:38.062
You know what I hate about prison?

49
00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:41.482
You throw a wolf into a cage

50
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.310
and all you are going to
get is an angry wolf.


51
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.379
throw a man in with the whole pack?

52
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.412
They just make each other worse.

53
00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:56.255
But

54
00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.279
if he comes out of
there, clean,


55
00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:02.139
you think that means he was fixed?

56
00:10:02.763 --> 00:10:03.763
No.

57
00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:07.106
It means he didn't belong
there in the first place.


58
00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:11.591
You see, the real bad wolves,

59
00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:15.221
they can't be fixed.

60
00:10:18.138 --> 00:10:21.871
Maybe you want to tell me
what it is you're getting at.


61
00:10:22.904 --> 00:10:23.904
You get in,

62
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:25.247
get the goods,

63
00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.099
I pick you up.

64
00:10:28.685 --> 00:10:29.818
No one gets hurt.

65
00:10:31.747 --> 00:10:33.414
Then we go to New Holland

66
00:10:33.898 --> 00:10:37.031
and we swoop down there
like angels into hell.


67
00:10:37.976 --> 00:10:39.842
And we get your old man out.

68
00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:46.173
Arrowhead class.

69
00:10:47.525 --> 00:10:48.525
Model B.

70
00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:50.439
I think it suits you.

71
00:12:15.405 --> 00:12:16.405
... us?

72
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:18.076
I'm a few pikes behind

73
00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:20.546
You ready?

74
00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:23.538
Yeah.

75
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:25.874
I'm good.

76
00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:52.101
That's the back-end
of the whole system.


77
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.305
All you got to do is plug in,

78
00:12:54.329 --> 00:12:56.039
and your wrist link
will do the rest.


79
00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:02.088
A lot of it has been updated

80
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.960
But not all of it.

81
00:13:08.416 --> 00:13:09.416
This is new.

82
00:13:10.338 --> 00:13:13.271
We got to down some
systems to get access.


83
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:14.651
It's temporary.

84
00:13:14.721 --> 00:13:15.721
Just confirm.

85
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:30.868
This doesn't feel right!

86
00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:32.575
Relax!

87
00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:35.091
As soon as that transfer's done,

88
00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.809
it will all start back up.

89
00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:38.247
Is it close?

90
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.740
Yeah.

91
00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:41.724
It's moving.

92
00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:44.567
There's some kind of
storm out here!


93
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:46.591
We just took off
the ship's raincoat.


94
00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:49.481
<i>Warning, unstable
electromagnetic activity!</i>


95
00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:51.684
<i>Final systems offline.</i>

96
00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:53.490
Transfers done.

97
00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.466
What next?

98
00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:57.903
Send that data across to me.

99
00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:01.263
What do you mean,
just send it to you?


100
00:14:01.287 --> 00:14:03.513
It's pretty unstable out here, kid.

101
00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.076
Trust me on this.

102
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.560
Now what?

103
00:14:15.357 --> 00:14:16.357
Hatch!

104
00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.018
<i>Shuttle deploying in...</i>

105
00:14:58.292 --> 00:14:59.292
5...

106
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.316
4...3...

107
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.027
2...

108
00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:04.245
1.

109
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.218
<i>Welcome, guest.</i>

110
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.547
Hatch do you read me?

111
00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:10.789
<i>Let's log in.</i>

112
00:16:38.844 --> 00:16:39.844
<i>Warning!</i>

113
00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:43.656
<i>Preliminary readings indicate a
native toxic atmosphere.</i>


114
00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:48.195
<i>Prolonged exposure might cause
paralysis or death.</i>


115
00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:57.078
-How we doing?

116
00:16:57.922 --> 00:16:58.922
We got power?

117
00:16:59.907 --> 00:17:01.703
<i>I'd be happy to answer that.</i>

118
00:17:01.727 --> 00:17:03.023
<i>Let's log in.</i>

119
00:17:10.292 --> 00:17:11.492
<i>What is your name?</i>

120
00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.292
<i>Let's log in.</i>

121
00:17:14.464 --> 00:17:16.206
Just let me think for a second.

122
00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:18.292
<i>Understood, guest.</i>

123
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.839
<i>I have knowledge.</i>

124
00:17:22.964 --> 00:17:23.964
What?

125
00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:27.511
<i>Please seek alternative oxygen source.</i>

126
00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:32.637
How long do we have?

127
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:34.661
<i>I'd be happy to answer that.</i>

128
00:17:34.685 --> 00:17:35.791
<i>Let's log in.</i>

129
00:17:39.753 --> 00:17:41.260
<i>Attention, survivors.</i>

130
00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:42.854
<i>This is Oleander.</i>

131
00:17:42.878 --> 00:17:44.127
<i>Crash site is visible.</i>

132
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:45.768
<i>Get there as soon as you can.</i>

133
00:17:45.792 --> 00:17:47.792
<i>I repeat: get to the
main crash site.</i>


134
00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.534
I'm going out there

135
00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:51.558
and drag back someone
you <i>will</i> talk to.


136
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.041
<i>Good luck, guest.</i>

137
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.331
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.

138
00:18:15.942 --> 00:18:17.605
I'm not seeing from
the ground, Hatch.


139
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.324
Let me know how
you want to handle this.


140
00:18:38.214 --> 00:18:39.456
Let's log in.

141
00:20:08.144 --> 00:20:09.800
It's okay, you
don't need it.


142
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:11.824
shuttle breathing at 12 %.

143
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.763
12% won't last long.

144
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:30.888
So what are you?

145
00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:33.915
Tired.

146
00:20:34.782 --> 00:20:35.782
Hungry.

147
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:42.602
You don't know the shuttle,

148
00:20:43.173 --> 00:20:44.789
Your uniform isn't within regulation

149
00:20:44.813 --> 00:20:47.446
and I'm pretty sure I
didn't see you at the launch pad.


150
00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:49.742
<i>Welcome, guest.</i>

151
00:20:50.258 --> 00:20:51.258
<i>Let's log in.</i>

152
00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:55.125
And I guess you
didn't get a log in.


153
00:20:58.106 --> 00:21:00.848
Welcome, Tarren Hollis, biologist.

154
00:21:01.082 --> 00:21:03.613
- Locate the the Arrowhead wreckage.
- Okay.


155
00:21:08.192 --> 00:21:11.207
Arrowhead wreckage not in range.

156
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:13.184
It's a big planet.

157
00:21:13.793 --> 00:21:15.105
If you want to spot your ship,

158
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.043
Now you get to high ground.

159
00:21:17.144 --> 00:21:19.402
Well, the escape pods are leaving

160
00:21:20.888 --> 00:21:22.606
and I'm not going to
be here when they do.


161
00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:29.308
Hatch

162
00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:31.682
The data's safe, but I
can't send it from here.


163
00:21:32.363 --> 00:21:33.896
Where the hell are you?

164
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:39.831
It's a moon.

165
00:21:40.738 --> 00:21:41.738
What?

166
00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:44.742
It's not a planet.
It's a moon.


167
00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:46.995
Yeah?

168
00:21:47.253 --> 00:21:48.320
How do you know?

169
00:21:48.344 --> 00:21:50.344
Because that is a planet.

170
00:21:50.792 --> 00:21:52.259
And we're on its moon.

171
00:22:00.144 --> 00:22:01.909
You really have time
for a science lesson?


172
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.373
It's a research probe.

173
00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:06.478
We deployed in advance.

174
00:22:07.808 --> 00:22:10.378
We're gonna collect it.
But I mean...look at it.


175
00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:14.651
We sent it out just
four hours before the crash.


176
00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:16.753
This thing looks 50 years old.

177
00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:19.503
No.

178
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:21.461
Exact model number,

179
00:22:23.066 --> 00:22:24.466
the exact same probe.

180
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.164
We should keep moving.

181
00:22:27.474 --> 00:22:28.973
It's completely oxidized.

182
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:33.255
If this is what the atmosphere
is doing to metal,


183
00:22:34.177 --> 00:22:36.177
imagine what it's
doing to human tissue.


184
00:22:39.677 --> 00:22:40.677
Yeah.

185
00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:43.239
Let's keep moving.

186
00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:50.946
Now, this...

187
00:22:53.495 --> 00:22:55.261
This is what you're looking for.

188
00:22:56.699 --> 00:22:57.699
Whoa.

189
00:22:57.933 --> 00:22:58.933
That's our cue.

190
00:23:01.956 --> 00:23:02.956
Wait.

191
00:23:03.792 --> 00:23:04.792
What?

192
00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:07.456
I don't know.

193
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:10.544
It wasn't there before.

194
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
You sure?

195
00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:15.028
It's definitely new.

196
00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:17.305
It's a rock.

197
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:19.953
Kye, lesson's over. Let's go.

198
00:23:48.982 --> 00:23:50.048
<i>Welcome, guest.</i>

199
00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:53.815
<i>What is your name?</i>

200
00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:19.896
What's this for?

201
00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:21.576
Just in case.

202
00:24:23.747 --> 00:24:25.014
Just in case what?

203
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:28.341
We both know they are not
letting me on these escape pods.


204
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.474
Yeah, not dressed
like that, maybe.


205
00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:33.458
No. Not with this face,

206
00:24:34.388 --> 00:24:35.521
not with my name,

207
00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:37.466
my record,

208
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.075
I'm not getting off this planet.

209
00:24:40.638 --> 00:24:42.038
Not with you, anyway.

210
00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:45.763
There's something I got
to do for someone and...


211
00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:47.302
I don't have much time.

212
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:51.671
Hatch.

213
00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:55.319
The crash?

214
00:24:56.593 --> 00:24:58.193
it was Hatch, wasn't it?

215
00:25:00.675 --> 00:25:03.503
You know, this isn't the
first time he attacked us.


216
00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:06.709
Before attacking prisons,

217
00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:08.236
he was raiding convoys

218
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.651
and colonies.

219
00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.209
He kills a lot of people.

220
00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:14.133
It's what he does.

221
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.581
Or did he fail to
mention that to you?


222
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160
Propaganda.

223
00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:20.081
The truth.

224
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.821
I'm your only way out.

225
00:25:28.792 --> 00:25:30.592
I'll give you a fair trial!

226
00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:33.547
No one gets that.

227
00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:42.644
Anything from the silver seat?

228
00:25:42.933 --> 00:25:44.683
<i>I'm sorry. I did not.</i>

229
00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:46.940
We're flying out of here.

230
00:25:48.908 --> 00:25:51.884
How long will we last
out there on 9% oxygen?


231
00:25:52.392 --> 00:25:56.360
<i>Possibly enough to reach an
outpost station where we could refuel.</i>


232
00:25:56.509 --> 00:25:59.118
<i>Would you like to abandon
your distress call?</i>


233
00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:00.204
Yep.

234
00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:01.459
We're out of time.

235
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:03.040
Let's just fly this thing.

236
00:26:04.962 --> 00:26:06.259
Can I get some power here?

237
00:26:06.994 --> 00:26:07.994
<i>No.</i>

238
00:26:09.775 --> 00:26:11.308
What do you mean "No"?

239
00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:12.782
You just said we could fly.

240
00:26:13.244 --> 00:26:17.311
<i>Tarren Hollis is not authorized
to activate flight systems.</i>


241
00:26:17.334 --> 00:26:18.802
<i>Let's log in.</i>

242
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.327
<i>Earlier you mentioned Silver Seat.</i>

243
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:25.351
<i>Would you like to explore?</i>

244
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:26.802
Yeah.

245
00:26:27.217 --> 00:26:30.084
<i>The Silver Seat is a prototype
lightweight battleship</i>


246
00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:32.109
<i>designed by Hollis Industries.</i>

247
00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:34.990
<i>This prototype was abandoned
during Hatch-Ling conflict</i>


248
00:26:35.014 --> 00:26:38.029
<i>which General Tobias Hatch
was forced into hiding.</i>


249
00:26:38.053 --> 00:26:39.638
<i>and the Silver Seat</i>

250
00:26:39.662 --> 00:26:41.384
- <i>was never deployed.</i>
- Hatch.


251
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.607
Tell me more about Hatch.

252
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.361
<i>I have knowledge!</i>

253
00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:47.962
<i>Would you like to explore?</i>

254
00:26:49.104 --> 00:26:50.104
That.

255
00:26:51.369 --> 00:26:55.798
<i>The following is a confessional
video featuring General Tobias Hatch.</i>


256
00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:57.822
<i>Shortly after his capture in Alander,</i>

257
00:26:57.846 --> 00:27:00.284
<i>before his brief incarceration.</i>

258
00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:01.738
<i>State your name.</i>

259
00:27:02.785 --> 00:27:05.370
<i>Tobias Johans Hatch</i>

260
00:27:05.394 --> 00:27:07.394
<i>State your crime.</i>

261
00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:11.059
<i>Multiple accounts of
anti-government aggression,</i>


262
00:27:11.083 --> 00:27:13.388
<i>and instigation of revolt.</i>

263
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:16.887
<i>Please state specifically
your most recent crime.</i>


264
00:27:18.215 --> 00:27:21.762
<i>Planting of harmful materials
inside government ships.</i>


265
00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:26.426
<i>Sabotaging four terrorist operations.</i>

266
00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:29.902
<i>No, the record states
that your original confession</i>


267
00:27:29.926 --> 00:27:32.769
<i>refers to the sabotage
of scientific voyages.</i>


268
00:27:33.473 --> 00:27:35.606
<i>Do you reconfirm this amendment?</i>

269
00:27:36.543 --> 00:27:38.246
<i>I confirm the amendment.</i>

270
00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:40.847
<i>Do you confirm or deny
that you have formed</i>


271
00:27:40.872 --> 00:27:43.840
<i>an underground movement
codenamed "Redheads"</i>


272
00:27:43.864 --> 00:27:45.864
<i>to rally against General Lane?</i>

273
00:27:46.223 --> 00:27:47.223
<i>I confirm.</i>

274
00:27:48.645 --> 00:27:50.676
<i>And do you confirm
or deny your public</i>


275
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.074
<i>accusation that General Lane
plans to orchestrate</i>


276
00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:57.301
<i>an experimental prison that
allegedly code named Carshera Tempest?</i>


277
00:27:57.778 --> 00:27:58.778
<i>I confirm.</i>

278
00:28:00.033 --> 00:28:01.541
<i>Do you now confirm or deny</i>

279
00:28:01.565 --> 00:28:05.220
<i>this concept as a complete
falsehood fabricated by yourself?</i>


280
00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:10.565
<i>I confirm.</i>

281
00:28:12.486 --> 00:28:14.650
<i>Please state specifically.</i>

282
00:28:14.674 --> 00:28:18.722
<i>I confirm Carshera Tempest
as a falsehood.</i>


283
00:28:19.027 --> 00:28:20.878
Wait, take that back.

284
00:28:22.183 --> 00:28:23.183
There.

285
00:28:24.394 --> 00:28:25.394
<i>I confirm.</i>

286
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:31.784
You got any more
on this Carshera Tempest?


287
00:28:32.472 --> 00:28:34.862
<i>I'm sorry, that is classified.</i>

288
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:39.180
You were just starting
to get interesting.


289
00:28:41.274 --> 00:28:43.540
<i>Attention, any survivors come in.</i>

290
00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:45.732
<i>Please make contact.</i>

291
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:47.992
<i>Evac in 30 minutes.</i>

292
00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:14.379
You came.

293
00:29:14.528 --> 00:29:16.061
I heard from the ship.

294
00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:17.375
They're leaving.

295
00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:18.699
Now.

296
00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:20.115
So are you coming?

297
00:29:20.246 --> 00:29:21.246
Yeah.

298
00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:22.793
Are you?

299
00:29:23.137 --> 00:29:24.980
Not leaving without us.

300
00:29:26.504 --> 00:29:27.972
I meant what I said back there.

301
00:29:28.614 --> 00:29:29.881
About your clothes?

302
00:29:30.223 --> 00:29:32.207
They see you like that
they shoot you in the spot.


303
00:29:36.762 --> 00:29:38.113
What happened to a fair trial?

304
00:30:03.004 --> 00:30:04.004
Let's go.

305
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.316
<i>This is the final call
from Arrowhead.</i>


306
00:30:11.341 --> 00:30:13.341
<i>The escape pods are ready for launch.</i>

307
00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:16.441
<i>If there is anybody out
there, we are leaving.</i>


308
00:30:16.465 --> 00:30:17.793
They can't hear us?

309
00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:19.817
Arrowhead, do not leave!

310
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:21.841
Hey! Wait!

311
00:30:42.927 --> 00:30:43.927
Kye?

312
00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:54.812
Hurry!

313
00:31:00.977 --> 00:31:02.633
No, no, no,
no, no!


314
00:31:07.852 --> 00:31:08.852
Whoa!

315
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:02.684
<i>I have knowledge!</i>

316
00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:09.586
<i>Are you listening, 
Tarren Hollis?</i>

317
00:32:12.995 --> 00:32:13.995
I'm listening.

318
00:33:48.512 --> 00:33:49.512
Kye?

319
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:32.870
Symbiosis

320
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:35.240
<i>You mentioned Symbiosis.</i>

321
00:34:35.519 --> 00:34:37.252
<i>Would you like to explore?</i>

322
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:38.581
No.

323
00:34:38.862 --> 00:34:41.685
You know what? Don't prompt me.
If I want to know something I'll ask.


324
00:34:41.975 --> 00:34:43.508
<i>Yes, that makes sense.</i>

325
00:34:58.168 --> 00:34:59.527
<i>Welcome, guest!</i>

326
00:35:10.336 --> 00:35:11.670
So how did it feel?

327
00:35:13.617 --> 00:35:14.884
Like I was asleep.

328
00:35:16.797 --> 00:35:17.797
Nightmare.

329
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.397
How does it feel now?

330
00:35:25.412 --> 00:35:26.479
Like I'm awake.

331
00:35:29.952 --> 00:35:32.152
So you mean you...you feel fine?

332
00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.264
I feel cold.

333
00:35:37.662 --> 00:35:38.662
I feel heavier.

334
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:41.625
But I feel good, I...

335
00:35:43.311 --> 00:35:44.444
can't explain it.

336
00:35:47.272 --> 00:35:48.272
I kept going.

337
00:35:49.812 --> 00:35:51.212
After you were taken.

338
00:35:51.937 --> 00:35:53.603
Made it to the Arrowhead.

339
00:35:55.413 --> 00:35:56.413
And?

340
00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:58.054
Any food?

341
00:35:58.632 --> 00:35:59.632
Medicine?

342
00:36:00.765 --> 00:36:01.765
No.

343
00:36:02.374 --> 00:36:03.841
Any escape pods left?

344
00:36:10.374 --> 00:36:11.708
How long was I gone?

345
00:36:13.054 --> 00:36:14.254
Almost four days.

346
00:36:19.327 --> 00:36:20.327
Still got time.

347
00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:22.655
For what?

348
00:36:23.523 --> 00:36:24.523
That thing

349
00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:25.929
you had to do.

350
00:36:28.503 --> 00:36:29.503
Time yeah.

351
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160
Options no.

352
00:36:34.121 --> 00:36:36.987
Unless you figured out a
way to get this shuttle in the air.


353
00:36:37.956 --> 00:36:39.089
We can't fly it.

354
00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:44.450
But we aren't the
only ones still here.


355
00:36:45.482 --> 00:36:46.482
Are we?

356
00:37:25.644 --> 00:37:26.745
Oleander.

357
00:38:04.342 --> 00:38:05.342
You wait here.

358
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.050
<i>Scan error.</i>

359
00:39:01.809 --> 00:39:03.902
<i>Welcome, Norman Oleander.</i>

360
00:39:09.438 --> 00:39:10.765
Son of a bitch!

361
00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:16.953
REEF ?

362
00:39:16.977 --> 00:39:18.719
How long to Liberation Day?

363
00:39:18.743 --> 00:39:21.531
76 days until Liberation Day.

364
00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:22.672
You hear that?

365
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:25.054
We're getting out of here.

366
00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:29.258
What about Oleander?

367
00:39:30.273 --> 00:39:31.453
Can't come with us.

368
00:39:37.216 --> 00:39:38.216
What?

369
00:39:39.036 --> 00:39:40.103
I remember you.

370
00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:44.919
You were in the elite
guard protecting my father.


371
00:39:46.497 --> 00:39:47.497
Yeah.

372
00:39:48.646 --> 00:39:49.646
I know.

373
00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:52.669
You weren't gonna say anything?

374
00:39:53.646 --> 00:39:54.846
What's the point?

375
00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:56.255
I don't know you.

376
00:39:57.068 --> 00:39:58.268
You don't know me.

377
00:39:58.482 --> 00:39:59.482
Not really.

378
00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:01.922
You're not a kid anymore.

379
00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:04.348
You're old enough
to protect yourself.


380
00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:07.009
I'm not asking you
to protect me.


381
00:40:08.216 --> 00:40:09.283
I'm just saying.

382
00:40:10.013 --> 00:40:12.239
The man I remember wouldn't
just leave somebody to die.


383
00:40:12.263 --> 00:40:14.263
You don't know anything about me.

384
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.825
But I do remember
that you used to be funny.


385
00:40:20.958 --> 00:40:23.052
You used to smile
at us just to see us laugh.


386
00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:28.412
I'm looking at you now, Kye and...

387
00:40:29.489 --> 00:40:31.145
your eyes,

388
00:40:31.591 --> 00:40:32.591
they're different.

389
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:37.908
And you've got this scowl that
drains the mood out of a room.


390
00:40:38.463 --> 00:40:41.628
And your hands...they
shake when you think too hard.


391
00:40:42.627 --> 00:40:45.894
Do you even remember
that man I'm talking about?


392
00:40:47.302 --> 00:40:48.893
If I let your friend on board

393
00:40:50.607 --> 00:40:53.739
I'd jeopardize my only
chance to get to New Holland.


394
00:40:56.617 --> 00:40:59.797
And I lose the last person
who means something to me.


395
00:41:00.547 --> 00:41:01.547
And Oleander?

396
00:41:02.617 --> 00:41:03.950
What happens to him?

397
00:41:05.774 --> 00:41:08.174
I don't know if I can protect you.

398
00:41:10.446 --> 00:41:11.672
Yes, you can.

399
00:41:13.439 --> 00:41:14.572
It's what you do.

400
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:43.075
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no no,


401
00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:45.099
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,


402
00:41:45.123 --> 00:41:47.005
- no, no, no, no...
- Are you okay?


403
00:41:47.552 --> 00:41:49.019
No, no, we can't be here.

404
00:41:49.043 --> 00:41:50.489
We can't be here.

405
00:41:50.514 --> 00:41:53.028
I'm not okay, you're not okay.
We can't be here!


406
00:41:55.407 --> 00:41:56.407
You!

407
00:41:57.172 --> 00:41:58.639
You think you know him,

408
00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:01.344
you think you know Hatch,

409
00:42:02.984 --> 00:42:04.883
you think you know him.

410
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:07.804
Just lie down.

411
00:42:08.024 --> 00:42:09.570
- Okay?
- Now do something!


412
00:42:09.758 --> 00:42:11.531
He'll come after you!

413
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.695
He'll come after you and there'll
be no place for you to hide!


414
00:42:16.476 --> 00:42:20.226
It's him getting closer!
I mean, he won't stop!


415
00:42:21.224 --> 00:42:22.224
Oleander...

416
00:42:23.193 --> 00:42:25.036
We can't be here!

417
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.122
Calm down, just calm down.

418
00:42:28.372 --> 00:42:29.536
They're gonna destroy your heart!

419
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.133
- What?
- They're gonna destroy your heart!


420
00:42:34.372 --> 00:42:35.661
Find a heart!

421
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.630
Find a heart!

422
00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:39.654
Rip it out!

423
00:42:39.678 --> 00:42:41.336
Hey, hey!

424
00:42:42.063 --> 00:42:43.063
Kye?

425
00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:15.532
What happened?

426
00:46:16.703 --> 00:46:20.636
<i>The engine was left running
and eventually it burned out.</i>


427
00:46:20.703 --> 00:46:21.703
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

428
00:46:23.133 --> 00:46:24.533
How long was I gone?

429
00:46:25.914 --> 00:46:28.758
<i>Would you like the
figure in hours or days?</i>


430
00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:32.108
REEF. Days.

431
00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:34.305
How long?

432
00:46:35.762 --> 00:46:37.137
<i>Thirty-four.</i>

433
00:46:42.168 --> 00:46:43.235
Liberation Day?

434
00:46:44.598 --> 00:46:48.449
<i>There are 42 days until Liberation Day.</i>

435
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.449
This can't happen again.

436
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:56.851
Whatever happened,

437
00:46:58.807 --> 00:47:00.274
it can't happen again.

438
00:47:01.581 --> 00:47:02.948
When I lose that time.

439
00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:05.901
I lose my father.

440
00:47:09.237 --> 00:47:10.807
<i>I have knowledge.</i>

441
00:47:12.795 --> 00:47:13.795
Go.

442
00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:16.502
<i>I must warn you</i>

443
00:47:17.006 --> 00:47:19.748
<i>while you were gone,
I detected the heartbeat</i>


444
00:47:19.772 --> 00:47:21.529
<i>of Norman Oleander</i>

445
00:47:21.553 --> 00:47:23.193
<i>approaching the shuttle.</i>

446
00:51:44.749 --> 00:51:46.749
REEF, did you hear something?

447
00:51:49.726 --> 00:51:51.147
<i>No, Kye.</i>

448
00:51:52.894 --> 00:51:55.957
<i>I sense a significant
heart-rate change, Kye.</i>


449
00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:57.981
<i>Are you troubled?</i>

450
00:52:00.941 --> 00:52:03.324
<i>You must restrain yourself, Kye.</i>

451
00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:04.855
REEF!

452
00:52:07.972 --> 00:52:08.972
REEF!

453
00:52:09.143 --> 00:52:10.495
What's happening to me?

454
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.520
<i>You will endanger the shuttle.</i>

455
00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:17.057
<i>You cannot stay here.</i>

456
00:52:18.183 --> 00:52:19.183
<i>Kye!</i>

457
00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:22.259
<i>Leave.</i>

458
00:53:58.649 --> 00:53:59.649
Fear...

459
00:54:02.258 --> 00:54:03.258
Pain

460
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.353
It all triggers it.

461
00:54:10.242 --> 00:54:11.776
<i>What is your question?</i>

462
00:54:12.047 --> 00:54:13.714
I don't have a question.

463
00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:17.602
Whatever this is,

464
00:54:19.414 --> 00:54:21.014
I have to get rid of it.

465
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:46.292
You have to cut it
out of me, REEF.


466
00:54:49.449 --> 00:54:51.382
I can't have it inside of me.

467
00:54:54.745 --> 00:54:56.412
We have to get rid of it.

468
00:54:59.058 --> 00:55:00.791
We have to get rid of it.

469
00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:04.475
We have...to get rid of it.

470
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:05.980
<i>Kye!</i>

471
00:55:07.074 --> 00:55:08.874
<i>We have to get
rid of it.</i>


472
00:55:09.808 --> 00:55:11.253
<i>Please, Kye...</i>

473
00:55:12.866 --> 00:55:14.532
I have to get rid of it.

474
00:55:15.514 --> 00:55:16.981
Before Liberation Day.

475
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.854
<i>You mentioned Liberation Day.</i>

476
00:55:22.854 --> 00:55:25.010
<i>May I say something, Kye?</i>

477
00:55:28.393 --> 00:55:30.860
I have to get this shuttle started.

478
00:55:31.034 --> 00:55:33.088
I have to get this shuttle started.

479
00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:35.260
I have to get this shuttle started.

480
00:55:35.284 --> 00:55:37.284
I have to get this shuttle started!

481
00:55:39.472 --> 00:55:41.464
I have to get this shuttle started.

482
00:55:41.488 --> 00:55:43.488
- <i>Kye?</i>
- What?


483
00:55:46.659 --> 00:55:48.979
<i>You mentioned Liberation Day.</i>

484
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:51.861
<i>May I say something, Kye?</i>

485
00:55:53.498 --> 00:55:56.432
<i>Liberation day was celebrated
two days ago.</i>


486
00:58:50.495 --> 00:58:51.495
Yes!

487
00:58:53.019 --> 00:58:54.019
Yes!

488
00:58:57.949 --> 00:58:58.949
It's time.

489
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:01.770
It's happening.

490
00:59:03.004 --> 00:59:05.804
<i>Kye, your routine
should not be broken.</i>


491
00:59:05.828 --> 00:59:08.347
<i>You must stay within
the perimeter today.</i>


492
00:59:11.332 --> 00:59:13.265
No way I'm missing it again.

493
01:00:57.511 --> 01:00:59.644
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!


494
01:01:09.607 --> 01:01:11.997
<i>I'm sorry her ID badge was taken.</i>

495
01:01:12.466 --> 01:01:14.666
<i>I know what it means to you, Kye.</i>

496
01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:17.372
-It's just as way to pass time.

497
01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:20.955
<i>You look quite unhealthy, Kye .</i>

498
01:01:21.271 --> 01:01:22.872
<i>I've been wanting to
speak with you about</i>


499
01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:24.896
<i>a theory regarding your condition.</i>

500
01:01:24.997 --> 01:01:26.064
You just spoke.

501
01:01:26.087 --> 01:01:28.087
<i>This is a new theory.</i>

502
01:01:28.112 --> 01:01:29.726
<i>I believe that the creature could</i>

503
01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:33.133
<i>in fact be a reborn Norman Oleander.</i>

504
01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:37.414
<i>And I believe that you and
he share the same symbiotic condition.</i>


505
01:01:37.438 --> 01:01:41.128
<i>Only his transformation
seems to be a permanent one.</i>


506
01:01:41.152 --> 01:01:45.057
<i>If I were to obtain a tissue
sample of the Oleander creature,</i>


507
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:47.362
<i>perhaps by baiting and trapping it,</i>

508
01:01:47.386 --> 01:01:50.323
<i>I believe I could help you
overcome your condition.</i>


509
01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.980
<i>Or has that slipped your mind?</i>

510
01:01:53.527 --> 01:01:55.593
No, it hasn't slipped my mind.

511
01:01:56.003 --> 01:01:57.003
Alright?

512
01:02:00.347 --> 01:02:02.414
It's the only thing on my mind.

513
01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:06.768
<i>Have you considered a greater sacrifice?</i>

514
01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.125
You mean death?

515
01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:12.199
<i>Yes.</i>

516
01:02:12.324 --> 01:02:13.857
<i>The death of this body.</i>

517
01:02:17.225 --> 01:02:21.107
<i>it is possible that death is
now a part of your life cycle.</i>


518
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:24.325
<i>Three years ago you
destroyed Norman Oleander.</i>


519
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.350
<i>His skeleton remains,
yet it seems</i>


520
01:02:26.374 --> 01:02:29.208
<i>his consciousness somehow lives on</i>

521
01:02:29.232 --> 01:02:31.232
<i>in a new, replicated body.</i>

522
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.495
<i>Though there is a distinct possibility</i>

523
01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:36.370
<i>that you could return in
permanent creature form</i>


524
01:02:36.394 --> 01:02:37.847
<i>as he does.</i>

525
01:02:38.238 --> 01:02:39.838
You're gonna wake me up,

526
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.004
transform me back.

527
01:02:47.886 --> 01:02:48.886
<i>I will try.</i>

528
01:02:52.664 --> 01:02:53.664
You will try.

529
01:02:57.679 --> 01:02:58.968
Why don't you try dying?

530
01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:04.311
See if you feel like
yourself when you come back?


531
01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:10.984
I'm not killing myself just so
I can fight it with a fresh coat of paint.


532
01:03:11.008 --> 01:03:13.008
alright?

533
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:17.923
I'm doing just fine.

534
01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:21.177
<i>I'm rarely wrong, Kye.</i>

535
01:03:22.784 --> 01:03:23.784
<i>Kill yourself.</i>

536
01:04:42.237 --> 01:04:45.142
Come to me. Come on.

537
01:04:53.086 --> 01:04:55.555
Come on. Come to me.

538
01:05:07.883 --> 01:05:09.937
<i>Come on...</i>

539
01:05:10.946 --> 01:05:12.219
Come on...

540
01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:14.610
<i>Come on...</i>

541
01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:44.098
REEF!!

542
01:05:45.536 --> 01:05:46.669
You damn genius.

543
01:05:47.685 --> 01:05:49.418
We should talk more often!

544
01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:00.084
<i>This is interesting.</i>

545
01:06:00.584 --> 01:06:04.006
<i>I have cross-referenced
the Arrowhead crew medical records</i>


546
01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:06.592
<i>and the tissue sample
does indeed match</i>


547
01:06:06.616 --> 01:06:08.616
<i>that of Norman Oleander.</i>

548
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:12.359
<i>Although these cells have been
reproduced from a single source</i>


549
01:06:12.383 --> 01:06:14.797
<i>most likely his original body.</i>

550
01:06:14.822 --> 01:06:18.503
<i>Perhaps this strange sound could
lead you to its location.</i>


551
01:06:18.527 --> 01:06:21.659
It was the same sound
the night I killed Oleander?


552
01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:24.235
You heard that before?

553
01:06:24.737 --> 01:06:28.271
<i>Yes. I also heard it
when you slit your own throat.</i>


554
01:06:28.713 --> 01:06:33.353
<i>It seems as if something on this moon
is responding to your deaths vocally.</i>


555
01:06:33.377 --> 01:06:36.385
<i>As if it were a mother
mourning the loss of its young.</i>


556
01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:40.728
<i>Its power to recreate you is
activated each time you die.</i>


557
01:06:42.857 --> 01:06:44.523
<i>Why does your hand shake?</i>

558
01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:46.638
It's fine.

559
01:06:47.318 --> 01:06:49.518
<i>Your body has been regenerated.</i>

560
01:06:49.654 --> 01:06:52.419
<i>All of your physical elements
have been erased.</i>


561
01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:54.950
<i>But the shake in your hand is consistent.</i>

562
01:06:55.521 --> 01:06:57.559
<i>I would like it
if you told me why.</i>

563
01:06:57.966 --> 01:06:59.809
I don't know. I'm not...

564
01:07:04.099 --> 01:07:05.432
I'm not a biologist.

565
01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:07.635
<i>I have knowledge!</i>

566
01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:10.082
<i>You mentioned biologist.</i>

567
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.927
<i>May I suggest a related topic?</i>

568
01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:14.857
No.

569
01:07:15.951 --> 01:07:17.151
<i>I apologize, Kye .</i>

570
01:07:18.154 --> 01:07:20.505
<i>Will I really get a chance
to speak about her?</i>


571
01:07:23.058 --> 01:07:25.991
<i>I've been wanting to speak
to you about it.</i>


572
01:07:26.015 --> 01:07:28.121
<i>But I cannot, without being prompted.</i>

573
01:07:29.426 --> 01:07:30.959
Yes, REEF, what is it?

574
01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:34.008
<i>Here is some suggested material.</i>

575
01:07:34.534 --> 01:07:36.268
<i>Would you like to explore?</i>

576
01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:50.551
Am I gonna like what I see?

577
01:07:50.774 --> 01:07:52.047
<i>I don't know.</i>

578
01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.006
You recorded this?

579
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:09.761
<i>Hey, Hey!</i>

580
01:08:10.761 --> 01:08:11.761
<i>Kye ?</i>

581
01:08:14.714 --> 01:08:16.514
I don't want to hear this.

582
01:08:16.683 --> 01:08:17.683
<i>Please, Kye .</i>

583
01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.919
<i>You did not transform
that night, Kye .</i>


584
01:08:33.942 --> 01:08:36.097
<i>This was your first death.</i>

585
01:08:36.122 --> 01:08:38.825
<i>Two deaths, two bodies.</i>

586
01:08:39.889 --> 01:08:41.068
Holy shit!

587
01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:45.029
<i>If I skip forward by a few
minutes, you will see that</i>


588
01:08:45.053 --> 01:08:47.764
<i>Tarren Hollis is very much alive.</i>

589
01:08:48.639 --> 01:08:51.545
<i>At least, she was at
this point in time.</i>


590
01:08:52.498 --> 01:08:56.498
<i>Her elevated heartbeat
moved away and then simply vanished.</i>


591
01:08:58.905 --> 01:08:59.905
She's alive?

592
01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:03.576
<i>There is more we can
learn from this recording.</i>


593
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.967
<i>Oleander suggested that
we find the heart.</i>


594
01:09:06.991 --> 01:09:09.740
<i>Perhaps if we find
and destroy this heart,</i>


595
01:09:09.764 --> 01:09:12.045
<i>we can put an end to
his and your suffering.</i>


596
01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:13.881
And you knew?

597
01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:17.932
This whole time?

598
01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:21.896
I can only share knowledge
when prompted, Kye .


599
01:09:22.483 --> 01:09:24.683
<i>I'm sorry, but this is my design.</i>

600
01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.171
<i>To put it simply,</i>

601
01:09:27.389 --> 01:09:28.389
I didn't ask.

602
01:09:29.514 --> 01:09:30.581
<i>You didn't ask.</i>

603
01:09:33.797 --> 01:09:34.797
You...

604
01:09:38.297 --> 01:09:39.828
son of a bitch.

605
01:09:44.664 --> 01:09:45.664
I didn't ask.

606
01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:48.933
Of course...I didn't ask.

607
01:09:53.497 --> 01:09:54.497
And you knew.

608
01:10:23.993 --> 01:10:27.001
I figured you were getting
sick of staring at that wall.


609
01:10:28.095 --> 01:10:29.095
<i>You did this?</i>

610
01:10:29.618 --> 01:10:30.618
I fixed you.

611
01:10:33.509 --> 01:10:34.509
<i>How?</i>

612
01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:38.579
I used the levitator from
the old research probe.


613
01:10:38.619 --> 01:10:40.681
Rewired it to your system.

614
01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:43.332
You got direct control.

615
01:10:44.017 --> 01:10:46.084
<i>This is very resourceful, Kye .</i>

616
01:10:48.716 --> 01:10:51.505
Sometimes you have to
break something to make it better.


617
01:10:55.724 --> 01:10:57.391
Sorry I switched you off.

618
01:10:58.865 --> 01:10:59.950
Haven't been myself

619
01:11:01.372 --> 01:11:02.372
in a long time.

620
01:11:03.552 --> 01:11:05.044
<i>I know, Kye .</i>

621
01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:07.088
Your heartbeat.

622
01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:09.076
It disappeared.

623
01:11:11.013 --> 01:11:12.480
Can you tell me where?

624
01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:18.181
REEF?

625
01:11:19.353 --> 01:11:20.353
<i>Yes?</i>

626
01:11:20.767 --> 01:11:24.071
<i>The heartbeat disappeared
four kilometers west of here.</i>


627
01:11:24.728 --> 01:11:26.016
Then that's where we're going.

628
01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:30.142
<i>What are you hoping to find?</i>

629
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720
Answers

630
01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:33.729
<i>And Tarren Hollis?</i>

631
01:11:35.993 --> 01:11:37.618
I don't really have
that kind of luck.


632
01:12:21.433 --> 01:12:22.700
How'd she get out?

633
01:12:22.724 --> 01:12:25.175
<i>Perhaps she went
through the tunnels.</i>


634
01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.408
Are you scanning there?

635
01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.847
Is there a path through
to the other side?


636
01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:32.323
<i>There are several tunnels.</i>

637
01:12:33.105 --> 01:12:34.669
<i>One of them might lead through.</i>

638
01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:20.959
Alright.

639
01:13:21.749 --> 01:13:22.749
Start mapping.

640
01:13:33.156 --> 01:13:34.471
Are you okay?

641
01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:37.429
I'm picking up strong
electrical-magnetic interference.


642
01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:41.055
It appears to be emanating
from deep in the caves.


643
01:13:43.289 --> 01:13:44.556
Can you handle it?

644
01:13:47.032 --> 01:13:48.032
<i>This way.</i>

645
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:09.736
You smell that?

646
01:14:17.919 --> 01:14:18.919
REEF?

647
01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.664
Turn on something bright.

648
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:22.221
<i>Something bright?</i>

649
01:14:22.245 --> 01:14:24.434
The brightest thing on
your display right now!


650
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.333
Turn the sound off!

651
01:15:05.992 --> 01:15:06.992
REEF?

652
01:15:30.261 --> 01:15:31.261
Take it!

653
01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:33.768
Not going back!

654
01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.630
<i>Goodbye, Norman Oleander.</i>

655
01:18:25.889 --> 01:18:26.889
Is this it?

656
01:18:27.319 --> 01:18:28.319
<i>Yes.</i>

657
01:18:34.838 --> 01:18:35.838
Something launched here.

658
01:18:38.729 --> 01:18:39.862
She made it here.

659
01:18:40.573 --> 01:18:41.906
And she launched it.

660
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
She took it.

661
01:18:46.135 --> 01:18:47.802
<i>This is good news, Kye .</i>

662
01:18:49.088 --> 01:18:50.088
She's alive!

663
01:18:54.275 --> 01:18:55.533
She made it!

664
01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:06.658
Don't move.

665
01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:51.998
This is a pulse grenade.

666
01:19:54.537 --> 01:19:57.271
This is what's causing your interference.

667
01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:00.210
it's what always caused it.

668
01:20:00.402 --> 01:20:04.002
<i>Why did you carry a
pulse grenade inside your foot?</i>


669
01:20:06.972 --> 01:20:09.372
I never would have
made it anyway.


670
01:20:45.521 --> 01:20:46.872
The escape pods.

671
01:20:48.935 --> 01:20:50.935
They launched three years ago!

672
01:20:52.154 --> 01:20:53.620
Why are they crashing?

673
01:20:54.036 --> 01:20:56.294
<i>There is more to be discovered here.</i>

674
01:20:56.513 --> 01:20:58.020
They were shot down!

675
01:21:00.044 --> 01:21:01.711
<i>It is strange, isn't it?</i>

676
01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:03.044
I saw these!

677
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:05.774
Frozen in the sky, every day!

678
01:21:07.646 --> 01:21:08.979
How's this possible?

679
01:21:10.701 --> 01:21:11.901
<i>I have knowledge!</i>

680
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:14.403
<i>Would you like to explore?</i>

681
01:21:30.005 --> 01:21:32.805
<i>Our prison system is fundamentally flawed.</i>

682
01:21:33.505 --> 01:21:35.839
<i>But tomorrow is always another day.</i>

683
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:37.984
<i>And that day is the day</i>

684
01:21:39.848 --> 01:21:41.048
<i>of Carcere Tempus.</i>

685
01:21:41.072 --> 01:21:44.231
<i>Our scientists believe they
wield the power of time dilation.</i>


686
01:21:44.255 --> 01:21:47.330
<i>Effectively creating a
facility within which</i>


687
01:21:47.342 --> 01:21:50.223
<i>time moves faster than
the outside world.</i>


688
01:21:50.988 --> 01:21:53.418
<i>Imagine our rehabilitated prisoners</i>

689
01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:56.902
<i>being put to use by providing
years worth of scientific</i>


690
01:21:56.926 --> 01:21:58.730
<i>research within seconds.</i>

691
01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:00.950
<i>One-hundred men go in.</i>

692
01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:05.706
<i>And mere moments later, an
entire fleet of brand new ships</i>


693
01:22:06.277 --> 01:22:08.410
<i>Imagine the manufacturing power.</i>

694
01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:11.581
<i>Our arrowhead science vessels are</i>

695
01:22:11.605 --> 01:22:13.605
<i>launching soon to scope out</i>

696
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.792
the perfect location
for Carcera Tempus.


697
01:22:17.144 --> 01:22:20.089
<i>Paving the way for
a quieter tomorrow.</i>


698
01:22:21.558 --> 01:22:23.491
I thought that was classified.

699
01:22:26.628 --> 01:22:28.628
Isn't that against your rules?

700
01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.925
<i>Sometimes you have to
break something to make it better.</i>


701
01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:32.625
I was up there for a few minutes

702
01:23:32.649 --> 01:23:35.570
wondering what to do,
after you crashed.


703
01:23:38.094 --> 01:23:40.827
But then this came
from your wrist link.


704
01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:49.301
I slowed it down.

705
01:23:50.175 --> 01:23:52.229
<i>I'm not seeing from
the ground, Hatch.</i>


706
01:23:52.558 --> 01:23:54.901
<i>Let me know how
you want to handle this.</i>


707
01:23:56.933 --> 01:23:57.933
It's all you.

708
01:23:59.175 --> 01:24:00.745
Years worth of recordings.

709
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.378
All hitting me within
a few minutes.


710
01:24:06.558 --> 01:24:08.625
I guess all I can really say is

711
01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:11.884
sorry I'm late.

712
01:24:13.025 --> 01:24:14.292
You shot them down.

713
01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.251
All of them.

714
01:24:17.751 --> 01:24:20.305
You have no idea what
they're trying to do.


715
01:24:20.329 --> 01:24:22.329
No, I get it.

716
01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:24.422
They're building a prison.

717
01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:26.126
Building it?

718
01:24:26.837 --> 01:24:28.504
They're not building it.

719
01:24:29.478 --> 01:24:33.411
it took this recording to
make me realize what's going on.


720
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.321
Carcera Tempus.

721
01:24:37.567 --> 01:24:38.817
Time dilation.

722
01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:43.325
It's not something they built.

723
01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:44.888
They found it.

724
01:24:45.489 --> 01:24:46.556
And we're on it.

725
01:24:48.114 --> 01:24:49.581
The gist of it is, kid

726
01:24:50.536 --> 01:24:53.981
as if for the three years you've been
down here you're learning how to breathe.


727
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:58.097
It's only been twenty minutes for me.

728
01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:01.262
And I am sorry about that.

729
01:25:02.161 --> 01:25:04.028
That is not what I intended.

730
01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:07.804
All I wanted was the Arrowhead data.

731
01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:12.075
You're gonna kill me for it.

732
01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:13.357
No.

733
01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:16.490
I just always have a "plan B".

734
01:25:18.052 --> 01:25:19.536
Research data, Kye.

735
01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.182
Where'd you dump it?

736
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:27.261
it's on the wrist link.

737
01:25:29.418 --> 01:25:30.418
In the shuttle.

738
01:25:32.387 --> 01:25:33.387
Wrong answer.

739
01:25:54.386 --> 01:25:56.682
You know what I
don't like about you?


740
01:25:58.136 --> 01:25:59.203
You're stubborn.

741
01:26:00.175 --> 01:26:01.375
Like your old man.

742
01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:04.341
He had a soft side.

743
01:26:06.019 --> 01:26:07.419
Which I could handle.

744
01:26:10.802 --> 01:26:12.929
But at least he didn't lie to me.

745
01:26:16.047 --> 01:26:17.380
You killed them all.

746
01:26:17.516 --> 01:26:18.516
No.

747
01:26:19.344 --> 01:26:20.411
Not all of them.

748
01:26:21.516 --> 01:26:23.049
There was one more pod.

749
01:26:24.453 --> 01:26:25.586
After the others.

750
01:26:27.334 --> 01:26:28.667
I was tracking <i>this</i>.

751
01:26:29.381 --> 01:26:31.448
So I thought that was your pod

752
01:26:31.472 --> 01:26:33.472
and decided not to blow it up.

753
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280
Lucky for <i>me</i>.

754
01:26:38.307 --> 01:26:40.440
Kye, I'm gonna make this simple.

755
01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:45.370
It's not there,

756
01:26:46.135 --> 01:26:47.135
the data,

757
01:26:47.815 --> 01:26:49.682
so where'd you dump it, huh?

758
01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:51.705
- Are you okay?
- Hey!


759
01:26:52.302 --> 01:26:53.302
Look at me.

760
01:26:53.654 --> 01:26:54.654
Look at me!

761
01:26:56.075 --> 01:26:59.410
We can stop lying from developing
this hell you've been living in.


762
01:26:59.598 --> 01:27:01.465
We'll know their every move!

763
01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:03.448
You can do this with me.

764
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:08.627
When I saw you were
destroying science ships,


765
01:27:10.236 --> 01:27:11.798
I hid it.

766
01:27:14.259 --> 01:27:15.259
Well, then,

767
01:27:17.658 --> 01:27:19.384
I start undressing her.

768
01:27:21.607 --> 01:27:22.973
Do you like that?

769
01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:25.817
Don't tell me you
haven't imagined it.


770
01:27:27.279 --> 01:27:29.546
Down here alone,
all these years?


771
01:27:30.716 --> 01:27:33.013
I'm sure your mind
wondered more than once.


772
01:27:35.702 --> 01:27:37.102
Sitting here alone...

773
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.603
Thinking about her soft skin.

774
01:27:40.896 --> 01:27:41.896
those blue eyes.

775
01:27:43.202 --> 01:27:44.202
Yeah.

776
01:27:45.155 --> 01:27:48.370
Undressing her in your mind
sounds like the highlight of your day.


777
01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:52.295
Only I'm not talking about
the same kind of undressing.


778
01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.567
All I want to take off

779
01:27:54.827 --> 01:27:56.760
is that breather on her face.

780
01:27:57.944 --> 01:27:58.944
Tell me.

781
01:27:59.249 --> 01:28:01.264
How long do you
think she'll last?


782
01:28:01.584 --> 01:28:05.725
How many more breaths will we get to
listen to coming out her pretty mouth?


783
01:28:05.749 --> 01:28:08.827
People like her don't
deserve to die.


784
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.764
You need to go after Lang.

785
01:28:13.772 --> 01:28:16.690
You committed mass murder
in the name of an ideal.


786
01:28:18.803 --> 01:28:20.470
You're smarter than that.

787
01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:24.830
Mass murder, genocide,
whatever you want to call it.


788
01:28:24.855 --> 01:28:26.859
I call it preempted bail.

789
01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:28.977
Now where is it?

790
01:28:32.671 --> 01:28:34.359
It's in the probe.

791
01:28:34.572 --> 01:28:35.572
What?

792
01:28:36.486 --> 01:28:37.819
The research probe.

793
01:28:39.517 --> 01:28:40.517
Outside.

794
01:28:45.183 --> 01:28:46.183
Thanks.

795
01:31:33.758 --> 01:31:34.758
<i>Kye ?</i>

796
01:31:38.336 --> 01:31:39.603
<i>Are you there, Kye ?</i>

797
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:45.571
<i>I need you to come outside.</i>

798
01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:50.530
<i>I know you're inside.</i>

799
01:31:56.083 --> 01:31:58.217
<i>I need you to come outside, Kye.</i>

800
01:32:03.365 --> 01:32:05.130
<i>I need you to wake up.</i>

801
01:32:10.227 --> 01:32:11.227
Kye ?

802
01:32:18.453 --> 01:32:19.453
Kye ...

803
01:32:20.547 --> 01:32:21.547
Look at me.

804
01:32:24.558 --> 01:32:25.825
You can control it.

805
01:32:30.722 --> 01:32:31.722
That's it.

806
01:32:32.652 --> 01:32:33.652
That's it.

807
01:32:35.474 --> 01:32:36.474
That's it.

808
01:32:39.732 --> 01:32:40.732
That's it.

809
01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:44.708
That's it.

810
01:33:45.917 --> 01:33:47.517
You got through to me.

811
01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:50.870
REEF did most of the work.

812
01:33:52.464 --> 01:33:53.565
He said he'd try.

813
01:34:01.324 --> 01:34:02.324
REEF.

814
01:34:32.516 --> 01:34:33.516
Look at you!

815
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.445
You still can't get this
through your thick skull?


816
01:34:36.469 --> 01:34:38.070
This place...

817
01:34:38.094 --> 01:34:40.406
we can't let it fall
under the wrong hands!


818
01:34:51.177 --> 01:34:53.278
We're gotta do this together, Kye!

819
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.990
But you're weak!

820
01:34:55.591 --> 01:34:56.591
You're nothing!

821
01:34:58.529 --> 01:35:01.302
This war has no place
for people like you.


822
01:35:02.402 --> 01:35:03.402
Yeah, well...

823
01:35:09.683 --> 01:35:11.268
You're recruited me.

824
01:35:43.693 --> 01:35:45.653
<i>Are you bringing my levotator, Kye?</i>

825
01:35:46.997 --> 01:35:48.864
We'll get you a better one.

826
01:35:49.638 --> 01:35:51.438
<i>New Holland is a long way!</i>

827
01:35:52.044 --> 01:35:53.044
