00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.470
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.029
Jess told me that he is,
like, way into Ella.


3
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.005
Ugh, can you say "slut"?

4
00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:19.905
- I heard she gave him a blumpie.
- Ew.


5
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:21.496
Boys are disgusting.

6
00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:24.402
And that guy, Nick,
he thinks he's all, like,


7
00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:26.735
"Look at me; I'm so beautiful."

8
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.947
- I think he's kind of cute.
- No, no.


9
00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:33.632
I mean, he's kind of hot,
but he's not God's gift. No.


10
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.263
I heard he hooked up with Michelle.

11
00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:37.465
No, he did not!

12
00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:41.131
He totally did, like, for real.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.638
Funny.

14
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.468
School night. Bedtime.

15
00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:46.472
But I'm studying with Lisa.

16
00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:48.563
Hey.

17
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.697
Hey, Lis, where's that big party
this weekend?


18
00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:52.966
Looks like she signed off.

19
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.040
Ooh, shocker.

20
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.834
Hey, isn't it past your bedtime?

21
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.066
Night, sweetie.

22
00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:00.434
- I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.


23
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.471
- Good night.
- Mwah.


24
00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.733
- Night, honey.
- Night.


25
00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:12.471
Hi.

26
00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:15.563
Shh.

27
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.606
Oh, my gosh, that's so cool!

28
00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:37.931
I was standing next to Chris
in science class today,


29
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.768
and he turned, and he looked at me

30
00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:41.134
out of the corner of his eye,

31
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.934
but I knew, I knew he was
looking right at me.


32
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:51.098
So then we start talking
about something.


33
00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.037
I don't know. It was really silly.

34
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.504
And then we just, like,

35
00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:57.539
started talking about lunch and stuff.

36
00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:58.698
But it was really nice.

37
00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.034
And then he asked me,

38
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.401
"Did you do the homework?"

39
00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:02.404
And I said, "Yeah."

40
00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:03.996
And he said, "Can I copy it?"

41
00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:05.505
And I said, "Yeah."

42
00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:08.095
I almost died.

43
00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:16.634
I'm gonna have to call you back.

44
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:18.764
Bye.

45
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.165
Jake?

46
00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:36.336
Jake?

47
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:49.396
Dad?

48
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:53.496
Mom?

49
00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:04.733
Do what I say, and you live.

50
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.967
I'm going to kill your mother
or your father.


51
00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.870
You have 60 seconds to decide.

52
00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:14.871
No!

53
00:03:14.974 --> 00:03:16.872
Choose,

54
00:03:16.973 --> 00:03:19.838
or I kill them both.

55
00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:21.600
I can't! I can't!

56
00:03:21.707 --> 00:03:25.469
Then that is your choice,

57
00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:27.096
and they both die.

58
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.366
No, no, no, no!

59
00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.371
No!

60
00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:30.804
Choose!

61
00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:32.601
Me, me, me, me, me!

62
00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:34.900
Kill me!

63
00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:39.605
Something to add, Dad?

64
00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:40.604
Please!

65
00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:42.195
Please calm down!

66
00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:43.671
I will give you whatever you want.

67
00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:46.069
Please don't hurt my family!

68
00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.332
Come here, Jake.

69
00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:00.331
All right, look.

70
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.030
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.037
You can do it. Choose me.

72
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.299
Just choose me.

73
00:04:04.407 --> 00:04:06.635
Otherwise he's gonna kill
our whole family.


74
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:09.002
Please, just be brave and choose me.

75
00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:10.970
Please, no.

76
00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:12.061
I can't, Daddy.

77
00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:13.161
Yes, you can.

78
00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:14.171
Yes, you can.

79
00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:17.206
Choose!

80
00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:19.739
He's gonna kill us all if you don't.

81
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:20.999
You can do it!

82
00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:23.971
All right, my father.

83
00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:25.039
My father!

84
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.538
What?

85
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.436
Please. Come on, now.

86
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.165
That a girl. That a girl.

87
00:04:31.274 --> 00:04:32.297
My father!

88
00:04:32.407 --> 00:04:36.396
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry!

89
00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:38.029
Okay, that's okay.

90
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.037
All right.

91
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.129
I love you, Daddy!

92
00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:53.302
And you will have
to do the dirty work.

93
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.129
Pick it up!

94
00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:12.564
You can do it.

95
00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:14.333
Be brave. Come on, sweetie.

96
00:05:16.173 --> 00:05:17.264
I can't.

97
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.737
Your choices have ramifications, Daddy.

98
00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:25.807
Now!

99
00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:27.032
I can't! I can't!

100
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.231
You can do it. 
You can do it.

101
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.237
Now!

102
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.431
- I can't!
- Do it.


103
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.665
Yes, you can, please!

104
00:05:34.774 --> 00:05:35.705
Daddy!

105
00:05:35.807 --> 00:05:36.931
Do it now!

106
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.700
Come on. That a girl.

107
00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:40.170
- Daddy!
- Damn it, do it now!


108
00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:42.933
Yes, Sara!

109
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.631
Do it!

110
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:46.798
Now, God damn it!

111
00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:48.996
Do it now!

112
00:05:50.507 --> 00:05:53.371
Daddy!

113
00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:22.717
CHOOSE

114
00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:51.005
Sheriff's deputies began
a search this morning


115
00:08:51.107 --> 00:08:53.664
for two men who went missing
on the lake yesterday.


116
00:08:53.773 --> 00:08:55.069
The sheriff says a family member

117
00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:57.401
reported the 19-year-old and 20-year-old

118
00:08:57.507 --> 00:08:59.166
missing early this morning.

119
00:08:59.274 --> 00:09:01.933
The two men whose names
are not being released yet


120
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.733
were last seen camping
in the area of the lake.


121
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.829
Investigators said a canoe
was missing from the shoreline.


122
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.133
The Sheriff's Department
and New York State Police


123
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.467
are helping in the search.

124
00:09:11.574 --> 00:09:12.869
We have a crew headed to the scene,

125
00:09:12.973 --> 00:09:14.405
and we'll bring you more information

126
00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:15.564
as it becomes available.

127
00:09:15.673 --> 00:09:17.264
Thank you, Sandy.

128
00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:02.731
The victim was 57-year-old

129
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.772
defense attorney Elliot Vincent.

130
00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:07.431
Police sources say the suspect
bound and gagged


131
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.005
Vincent and his wife.

132
00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:11.698
Then they say the suspect made
Vincent's teenage daughter


133
00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:13.931
choose which parent should die,

134
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.529
threatening to kill the entire family

135
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.106
if she didn't.

136
00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:19.570
Police describe the alleged
killer as a Caucasian male,


137
00:10:19.673 --> 00:10:21.003
approximately six feet tall,

138
00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:24.698
wearing a dark hooded
sweatshirt and knit cap.


139
00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:26.669
Vincent was best known for his role

140
00:10:26.773 --> 00:10:28.830
in the highly publicized
Wilshire Barrett case.


141
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.769
That case involved alleged sexual abuse

142
00:10:30.873 --> 00:10:32.668
in several state-run
correctional facilities


143
00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:34.671
throughout the county.

144
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.464
- Oh, God!
- Jesus!


145
00:12:50.573 --> 00:12:52.199
What the hell's the matter with you?

146
00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:53.567
You scared the shit out of me!

147
00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:57.469
Well, you left your door open.
Are you okay?


148
00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:01.336
And you're certain
that the door was locked?


149
00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:03.428
Positive. I had just checked it.

150
00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.937
Okay, 'cause there's no sign
of forced entry.


151
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.403
So you don't believe me?

152
00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:09.529
I'm not saying that.

153
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.833
The door was locked.

154
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.770
Ever since this article came out,

155
00:13:13.873 --> 00:13:17.067
I've had, like, 50 phone calls
down at the station,


156
00:13:17.173 --> 00:13:19.661
everybody in varying degrees
of hysteria.


157
00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:22.001
Oh, Dad.

158
00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:24.402
I know what you're thinking.

159
00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:26.166
Little Fiona living all alone

160
00:13:26.274 --> 00:13:28.739
with a overactive
reporter's imagination.


161
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.101
Easy, easy, okay?

162
00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:31.797
We'll dust for prints.
We'll investigate.


163
00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:33.203
It's just-- you want my gut on this?

164
00:13:33.307 --> 00:13:34.829
I think it's one of your stupid friends.

165
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.735
I don't have friends that
will pull a prank like that.


166
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.999
Okay, what about Paul?

167
00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:40.504
He's harmless.

168
00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:43.266
Okay, I give up.

169
00:13:43.373 --> 00:13:45.703
I'm sorry. I'll take it more seriously.

170
00:13:45.806 --> 00:13:48.102
In fact, why don't you sleep
at home tonight?


171
00:13:48.207 --> 00:13:51.434
For security reasons:
popcorn, old movies.


172
00:13:53.307 --> 00:13:56.966
Dad, I lost the pigtails years ago:

173
00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:58.130
Mm-hmm.

174
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.466
I'm getting my masters in June.

175
00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:00.834
Not if I talk to your professors

176
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.428
and they agree to flunk you.

177
00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:05.505
Just dust for prints.

178
00:14:05.606 --> 00:14:06.594
Please?

179
00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:07.967
Okay.

180
00:14:08.073 --> 00:14:09.698
Let's talk about this
for a moment, though,


181
00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:11.328
the scanner you're not supposed to have.

182
00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:12.530
I know.

183
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.197
I just like to keep track of you.

184
00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:15.329
Of me?

185
00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:17.371
Not of your next story, big headlines?

186
00:14:17.473 --> 00:14:19.064
All you, all the time.

187
00:14:19.173 --> 00:14:20.536
All right.

188
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.606
Then clearly you won't mind
that I dusted for prints,


189
00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:24.263
because as you mentioned--

190
00:14:24.373 --> 00:14:26.396
Oh, jeez. Hold on.

191
00:14:28.274 --> 00:14:29.933
Go for Wagner.

192
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.528
Yeah.

193
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.629
Uh-huh.

194
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.899
Ouch.

195
00:14:37.007 --> 00:14:37.938
Okay.

196
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.006
Yeah.

197
00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:42.073
I have to go.

198
00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.468
I'll take this for prints.

199
00:14:44.573 --> 00:14:46.835
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.


200
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.803
Just a domestic disturbance
kind of thing.


201
00:14:48.907 --> 00:14:49.998
I'll see you soon.

202
00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:53.164
My mom would get the axe.

203
00:14:53.274 --> 00:14:55.398
She spends every dime of my inheritance

204
00:14:55.506 --> 00:14:58.029
without my old man keeping tabs on her.

205
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.765
I don't know. I guess my dad?

206
00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:02.169
Or shit, maybe my mom.

207
00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:03.432
You know what? Forget this.

208
00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:04.869
I don't even want to think about it.

209
00:15:04.973 --> 00:15:07.098
What about you, Fiona?
Which one would you choose?


210
00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:09.434
You are such a dumb-ass.

211
00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:10.527
Hello?

212
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.503
Shit, I
-I spaced. I'm sorry, Fi.

213
00:15:12.606 --> 00:15:13.697
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:14.829
Oh, look at that.

215
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.997
Not having a mom has its advantages.

216
00:15:18.107 --> 00:15:19.470
How about this one?

217
00:15:19.573 --> 00:15:21.233
You have to sleep
with that guy or me?

218
00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:23.430
- Choose.
- Ooh, tough one.


219
00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:25.199
- I feel your pain, Fi.
- You have to choose.


220
00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:26.966
You have a gun to your head.

221
00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:28.504
I don't, and I won't.

222
00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:29.833
Choose.

223
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.168
Jesus, Paul, back off, why don't you?

224
00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:33.830
I'm just kidding. God.

225
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.530
Look, guys, I got to go.

226
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.867
Well, South Bat tonight?

227
00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:39.268
No, I don't know.
I got to finish my paper.


228
00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:41.999
Blah, blah, blah.
Just get your ass there, okay?


229
00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.504
Idiot.

230
00:15:47.073 --> 00:15:49.265
Go by Jefferson Hall.

231
00:17:39.773 --> 00:17:42.001
A little less staccato
in that last measure.


232
00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:43.936
Otherwise, very nice.

233
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.369
Bravo.

234
00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:47.803
I will see you all one hour
before the performance tomorrow.


235
00:17:47.907 --> 00:17:50.600
David, would it be all right
if I hang back for a while


236
00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:52.228
and run through it on my own?

237
00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:53.805
By all means.

238
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.873
You're coming along nicely, by the way.

239
00:17:55.973 --> 00:17:58.097
Late bloomer, I guess.

240
00:17:59.306 --> 00:18:02.795
Mind the house lights when you leave.

241
00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:42.663
Hello?

242
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:45.466
Who--who's there?

243
00:18:45.573 --> 00:18:46.561
Thank you.

244
00:18:46.673 --> 00:18:51.435
Um, I was just leaving.

245
00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:52.436
Sorry.

246
00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:53.436
Oh.

247
00:18:56.106 --> 00:18:57.732
Hello?

248
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.362
I just wanted to practice the end,

249
00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.633
but I'm done, so it's fine.

250
00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.027
David?

251
00:19:08.139 --> 00:19:12.469
Is that you?

252
00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:13.732
Hello?

253
00:19:18.306 --> 00:19:20.431
Hey!

254
00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:23.437
Stop screwing around!

255
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.103
Hey!

256
00:19:50.206 --> 00:19:51.229
I'm still in here.

257
00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:53.168
Come on, open up.

258
00:20:08.172 --> 00:20:10.161
Who is that?

259
00:20:22.706 --> 00:20:25.695
slam!

260
00:20:29.106 --> 00:20:30.470
Oh, God.

261
00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:38.896
Who's that? Who are you?

262
00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:41.302
I'm a member of the orchestra.
It's okay for me to be here.


263
00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.872
I mean, I'm just David's friend.

264
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:52.732
Just take-- take my money.

265
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.032
I don't want your money, Simon.

266
00:20:55.139 --> 00:21:00.902
I am going to take something
much more dear to you than that.


267
00:21:01.006 --> 00:21:03.370
Either you lose the ability to hear

268
00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:07.769
or your lose the ability to play.

269
00:21:15.072 --> 00:21:16.003
Shut up! This way!

270
00:21:16.106 --> 00:21:17.504
Hurry up! Get on your knees!

271
00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:20.130
Okay!

272
00:21:20.873 --> 00:21:23.862
Choose.

273
00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:28.503
Your hearing...

274
00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:32.800
or your fingers.

275
00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.372
Why is this happening?

276
00:21:34.473 --> 00:21:37.371
You have 60 seconds to decide.

277
00:21:37.473 --> 00:21:40.268
What's it gonna be?

278
00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:42.339
Fine.

279
00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:45.200
Fingers.

280
00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:48.568
But you have one more choice to make.

281
00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:51.070
All at once

282
00:21:51.172 --> 00:21:55.968
or one at a time?

283
00:21:56.072 --> 00:21:59.061
Choose!

284
00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:11.203
crunch!

285
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.128
ISO_17?

286
00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:41.603
ISO_17.

287
00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:10.203
Hey, hey, no sleeping in here!

288
00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:11.272
God damn it.

289
00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:13.168
How'd you even get--

290
00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:19.571
Shit.

291
00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.001
So the janitor found
the poor bastard passed out


292
00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:25.072
in the staircase.

293
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.035
No witnesses, no security cameras.

294
00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:28.537
Great. What else?

295
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.595
Looks like we got a pattern.

296
00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:34.796
That's blood.

297
00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:38.304
From the crime scene last night.

298
00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:39.497
That's a match.

299
00:24:39.606 --> 00:24:40.832
Where's the victim?

300
00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:42.633
Covenant Hospital.

301
00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:45.467
Show me where they found him.

302
00:24:45.573 --> 00:24:46.470
How bad is it?

303
00:24:46.573 --> 00:24:47.799
He'll live.

304
00:24:47.906 --> 00:24:49.395
I'm not sure how much
he's gonna want to.


305
00:24:49.506 --> 00:24:50.698
Snipped off all his fingers

306
00:24:50.805 --> 00:24:52.601
and made sure they
couldn't be sewn back on.


307
00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:58.065
Oh, shit.

308
00:24:58.172 --> 00:25:00.263
Yeah, that's the symbol
I told you about.


309
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:03.100
I already got Jamie on it.

310
00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:06.195
Christ almighty.

311
00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:13.132
The aforementioned fingers.

312
00:25:13.239 --> 00:25:15.068
Sheriff Wagner. Follow me.

313
00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:17.604
Sheriff Wagner, any comments
for the evening news?


314
00:25:17.705 --> 00:25:18.898
- No.
- Come on, Tom.


315
00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:20.131
Throw me a bone here.

316
00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:21.898
Your kid wants to join their ranks?

317
00:25:22.006 --> 00:25:23.199
Good times.

318
00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:26.295
Sheriff Wagner has no comment.

319
00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:27.894
"Sources close to the investigation

320
00:25:28.006 --> 00:25:29.438
"say the attacker forced the victim

321
00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:31.334
"to choose between losing his hearing

322
00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:32.995
or losing his fingers."

323
00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:34.731
How does a person
do something like that?


324
00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:36.533
You know, personally, 
I think I'd rather

325
00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:38.469
lose my hearing and be deaf
than lose my fingers,


326
00:25:38.573 --> 00:25:39.629
but the guy was a pianist,

327
00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:41.830
so a pretty raw deal either way, right?

328
00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:44.531
Hello? What is with you?

329
00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:46.538
You're acting all weird. Are you okay?

330
00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:47.935
If I tell you something,

331
00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:50.062
do you promise not to think I'm crazy?

332
00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:53.105
- Forget about it.
- No, tell me.


333
00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:54.570
No, really, let's just drop it.

334
00:25:54.672 --> 00:25:56.002
Fi!

335
00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:02.737
In her note,
my mom talked about choices,


336
00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:04.032
and it never made sense.

337
00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:06.002
But what if someone made her choose,

338
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.072
choose between doing what she did

339
00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:11.400
or--or something else
that was even more horrible?


340
00:26:11.506 --> 00:26:13.335
That would explain it, right?

341
00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:15.530
Then it would make sense.

342
00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:17.696
Have you spoken
to your father about this?


343
00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:19.828
God, I can't talk to him
about this stuff.


344
00:26:19.939 --> 00:26:21.802
Last time I tried,
he totally freaked out on me.


345
00:26:21.906 --> 00:26:23.372
Maybe you should just try, Fi.

346
00:26:23.473 --> 00:26:25.200
You know, maybe you should just try.

347
00:26:32.406 --> 00:26:33.394
You're right.

348
00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:34.698
It's silly.

349
00:26:34.805 --> 00:26:38.067
I'm just being silly.

350
00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:09.628
Mr. Campbell?

351
00:27:09.739 --> 00:27:12.864
Not another one of you.

352
00:27:12.972 --> 00:27:14.870
I just...

353
00:27:14.972 --> 00:27:16.495
I just want to get some sleep.

354
00:27:16.605 --> 00:27:19.696
Of course.

355
00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.703
I understand.

356
00:27:24.672 --> 00:27:25.695
Get on with it already.

357
00:27:25.805 --> 00:27:28.532
Come on, come on.

358
00:27:30.972 --> 00:27:36.871
Um, is there anything else
you can think of that might help


359
00:27:36.972 --> 00:27:38.904
identify the guy who did this to you?

360
00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:41.472
How many times
do I have to go over this?


361
00:27:41.572 --> 00:27:43.266
It was dark.

362
00:27:43.373 --> 00:27:46.134
He had a flashlight
in my eyes the whole time.


363
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:49.171
I don't know who he was
or how he knew my name--


364
00:27:49.273 --> 00:27:51.466
He knew your name?

365
00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:56.131
What else did he know about you?

366
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:58.761
Nothing, I guess.

367
00:27:58.872 --> 00:28:00.497
Did he say anything to you
that stuck out


368
00:28:00.605 --> 00:28:02.628
or anything that you could
think of that might have--


369
00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:07.434
Something about choices
and, uh, ramifications


370
00:28:07.538 --> 00:28:08.663
or something like that.

371
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:11.295
I don't know.

372
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:16.634
There must be a reason
why he picked you.


373
00:28:16.739 --> 00:28:19.035
There must be a reason
why he chose you.


374
00:28:19.139 --> 00:28:20.162
Can you think of anything?

375
00:28:20.273 --> 00:28:21.533
Do you know him?

376
00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:23.901
Have you ever met somebody
that might do this to you


377
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:25.165
or anything?

378
00:28:25.273 --> 00:28:27.102
Please, there must be a reason.

379
00:28:29.172 --> 00:28:31.535
I just--

380
00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.435
I just want to get some sleep.

381
00:30:46.206 --> 00:30:49.070
Okay, next.

382
00:30:49.172 --> 00:30:50.069
Okay, okay.

383
00:30:50.172 --> 00:30:51.330
Do you have the camera?

384
00:30:54.872 --> 00:30:56.099
Try a little less smile.

385
00:30:56.206 --> 00:30:57.398
You got five frames.

386
00:30:57.505 --> 00:30:58.937
Great, but it's not been the five best

387
00:30:59.039 --> 00:30:59.970
we've had so far, okay?

388
00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:01.060
Come on, give me a nice smile.

389
00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:02.899
Just give me your eyes. There you go.

390
00:31:03.006 --> 00:31:04.562
You know what? 
I'm over this.

391
00:31:04.672 --> 00:31:07.661
I'm done. I'm done.

392
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.664
Asshole.

393
00:31:15.772 --> 00:31:17.362
All right, you know,
let me see everything


394
00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:18.802
from the first camera right away.

395
00:31:18.906 --> 00:31:20.633
Just forget about the other one
for now, okay?


396
00:31:21.939 --> 00:31:24.167
No, I just wrapped.

397
00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:26.295
A bullshit day, as always.

398
00:31:26.405 --> 00:31:27.462
I don't feel well.

399
00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:28.799
Listen, I need to eat.

400
00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:31.770
So if you don't mind
putting in an order for me,


401
00:31:31.872 --> 00:31:33.667
that would be great.

402
00:31:33.772 --> 00:31:34.669
Yeah, I know.

403
00:31:34.772 --> 00:31:36.102
Baby, I know, but listen--

404
00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:37.432
I-- okay.

405
00:31:37.538 --> 00:31:38.595
Fine.

406
00:31:38.705 --> 00:31:39.864
Hey, sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:31:39.972 --> 00:31:41.233
We're just--we're wrapped up.

408
00:31:41.338 --> 00:31:42.804
Can you see that
I'm on the phone here?

409
00:31:42.906 --> 00:31:44.202
- Yeah, seriously.
- Okay.


410
00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:45.498
Not a conversation for you.

411
00:31:45.605 --> 00:31:47.332
Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:48.529
No, just some idiot.

413
00:31:48.639 --> 00:31:50.935
I'm sorry.

414
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.664
No, don't be such a fucking asshole.

415
00:31:52.772 --> 00:31:53.897
No, I don't care.

416
00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:55.665
He just walked in here
and was eavesdropping


417
00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:57.362
on my whole conversation.

418
00:31:57.472 --> 00:31:58.597
All right.

419
00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.295
Yeah, well,
you better start thinking of me


420
00:32:00.405 --> 00:32:01.302
for a change, all right?

421
00:32:01.405 --> 00:32:03.428
Yeah, okay.

422
00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:05.470
Yeah, well, that's your opinion.

423
00:32:05.572 --> 00:32:07.697
I'll see you later.

424
00:32:07.805 --> 00:32:09.066
If you want to get laid tonight,

425
00:32:09.172 --> 00:32:11.229
you better drop the fucking attitude.

426
00:32:15.338 --> 00:32:16.531
What?

427
00:32:16.639 --> 00:32:19.662
No, go away.

428
00:32:21.672 --> 00:32:23.228
Listen, I'll be done when I'm done.

429
00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:24.463
Just give me a minute.

430
00:32:26.805 --> 00:32:27.862
Are you fucking kidding me?

431
00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:30.233
What the-- listen, you little shit,

432
00:32:30.338 --> 00:32:31.770
whatever the fuck your name is,

433
00:32:31.872 --> 00:32:33.337
if you expect to come back here tomorrow

434
00:32:33.438 --> 00:32:34.335
and have a job--

435
00:32:34.438 --> 00:32:36.166
Hey, not funny!

436
00:32:36.272 --> 00:32:37.898
I thought you loved the camera, Jenna.

437
00:32:38.006 --> 00:32:39.631
Who the fuck are you, you creepy fuck?

438
00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:42.796
Sticks and stones will break your bones.

439
00:32:42.906 --> 00:32:44.769
Don't touch me. 
Don't touch me!

440
00:32:44.872 --> 00:32:46.133
Vain to the very end.

441
00:32:46.238 --> 00:32:49.398
Not afraid for your life,
just for your face.


442
00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:52.536
Help!

443
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:54.901
I want to offer you a choice.

444
00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:57.198
You have 60 seconds to decide.

445
00:32:57.305 --> 00:33:00.101
What is more dear to you, bitch?

446
00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:03.638
Your eyesight or your beauty?

447
00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:06.796
You'll either never be able
to see yourself again,


448
00:33:06.906 --> 00:33:12.702
or the world will see what
a miserable hag you really are.


449
00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:20.964
No, please!

450
00:33:21.072 --> 00:33:24.868
Now let me see
those big, beautiful lips.


451
00:33:24.972 --> 00:33:27.460
No, please!

452
00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:49.062
The hourglass is handmade.

453
00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:50.137
And I've timed it.

454
00:34:50.238 --> 00:34:51.465
It's exactly one minute.

455
00:34:51.572 --> 00:34:53.004
Down to the frickin' second.

456
00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:55.571
Perfection is certainly
keeping with the profile.


457
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:58.866
Hey, Alice. My dad here?

458
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:00.301
Yeah, his office.

459
00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:03.864
So that's now two handmade hourglasses.

460
00:35:03.972 --> 00:35:05.063
They match perfectly.

461
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.694
The last crime scene and now this one.

462
00:35:06.805 --> 00:35:10.033
We got zero fingerprints, zero hair.

463
00:35:10.138 --> 00:35:11.968
This guy's good, really good.

464
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:14.367
We've never seen this level
of expertise before.


465
00:35:14.472 --> 00:35:17.302
I'm just waiting on
the DNA report from Forensics,


466
00:35:17.405 --> 00:35:19.564
see if we can
get anything on the blood.

467
00:35:19.672 --> 00:35:21.137
I just heard the vic, 
Simon Campbell,

468
00:35:21.238 --> 00:35:23.397
has regained consciousness
up at Covenant Hospital,


469
00:35:23.505 --> 00:35:25.630
so I'm gonna head over there
and question him, all right?


470
00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:28.136
And let me know if anything
clicks with our piano man.


471
00:35:28.238 --> 00:35:31.534
Hey, Ms. Pulitzer herself.

472
00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:33.332
- Hmm.
- How you doing?


473
00:35:33.438 --> 00:35:35.097
Good. You?

474
00:35:35.205 --> 00:35:37.433
Oh, you know, been worse.

475
00:35:37.538 --> 00:35:39.094
Been better.

476
00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:44.765
Hey.

477
00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:48.398
- Bad time?
- No, no.


478
00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:49.903
Just promise me you'll never become

479
00:35:50.006 --> 00:35:51.528
one of these bottom-feeders.

480
00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:53.161
No comment.

481
00:35:53.272 --> 00:35:55.204
That's my line.

482
00:35:55.305 --> 00:35:56.430
Whole town's in a tizzy

483
00:35:56.538 --> 00:35:58.868
because there might be
a madman on the loose.


484
00:35:58.972 --> 00:36:01.460
Well, isn't there?

485
00:36:01.572 --> 00:36:02.629
It's a little early

486
00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:04.671
to be broadcasting
that kind of hysteria.


487
00:36:04.772 --> 00:36:07.636
So the crimes actually aren't connected?

488
00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:09.204
I'm not saying that.

489
00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:11.168
Then there's a maniac on the loose.

490
00:36:11.272 --> 00:36:13.033
Are we really having this discussion?

491
00:36:13.138 --> 00:36:14.331
You taking notes?

492
00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:16.597
God help the cops on your beat.

493
00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:17.932
Please, come in.

494
00:36:18.038 --> 00:36:20.300
Sit down.

495
00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:29.335
I got a pop-up message
this morning on my computer.


496
00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:32.529
Photographs of this woman
tortured, burned.


497
00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:33.969
I think she might be dead.

498
00:36:34.071 --> 00:36:36.663
Uh-huh.

499
00:36:36.772 --> 00:36:40.431
You know, that's terrible.

500
00:36:40.538 --> 00:36:41.969
I'm not saying it isn't,

501
00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:44.560
and I don't mean to downplay
what you're going through here.


502
00:36:44.672 --> 00:36:47.035
It's just that it could be spam.

503
00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.798
It could be one of your stupid friends.

504
00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:53.099
It had the same symbol
right there from that musician!


505
00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:56.268
Why didn't you tell me?

506
00:36:56.372 --> 00:36:57.565
Why didn't I tell you?

507
00:36:57.672 --> 00:36:59.035
That's classified information.

508
00:36:59.138 --> 00:37:01.604
Listen, I can't tell you everything,
all right?


509
00:37:01.705 --> 00:37:03.193
There's this crazy little fuzzy line

510
00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:04.430
between being your father

511
00:37:04.538 --> 00:37:06.663
and being in charge of an investigation,

512
00:37:06.772 --> 00:37:08.897
not to mention your
soon-to-be chosen prof--


513
00:37:09.005 --> 00:37:10.994
Don't give me that look.

514
00:37:11.105 --> 00:37:12.469
Your mother gave me that look.

515
00:37:12.572 --> 00:37:13.663
You piss her off too?

516
00:37:13.772 --> 00:37:15.795
Quite regularly.

517
00:37:20.938 --> 00:37:24.666
What I wouldn't give
for one of her looks right now.


518
00:37:24.772 --> 00:37:26.897
Oh, Fi.

519
00:37:27.005 --> 00:37:32.495
She would be so proud of you,
all this nosing around.


520
00:37:38.772 --> 00:37:39.964
Coming up on the anniversary.

521
00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:41.002
Is that right?

522
00:37:41.105 --> 00:37:43.628
It comes up so quick every year.

523
00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:45.830
Oh, come on, Dad.

524
00:37:45.938 --> 00:37:47.404
There's a lot of stress in the office,

525
00:37:47.505 --> 00:37:50.596
in case you hadn't noticed.

526
00:37:50.705 --> 00:37:52.330
Get your team to look at this, please.

527
00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:54.028
I will. I promise.

528
00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:56.536
Just promise me you're gonna
stay away from this case.


529
00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:58.195
- Promise.
- Okay, go.


530
00:37:58.305 --> 00:38:00.635
Go, go, go already.

531
00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:08.832
I told you she'd be a heartbreaker.

532
00:38:08.938 --> 00:38:11.029
Yeah, you did say something about that.

533
00:38:11.138 --> 00:38:13.536
Imagine if it was yours.

534
00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:17.332
Have forensics examine this
hard drive, will you, please?


535
00:38:17.438 --> 00:38:18.802
We, uh, we just got a call.

536
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:20.428
Looks like we got another one.

537
00:38:20.538 --> 00:38:21.834
Photo studio downtown.

538
00:38:21.938 --> 00:38:24.564
Young woman, tortured, burned?

539
00:38:24.672 --> 00:38:27.001
Jesus, you're good.

540
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:28.571
How the fuck did you get that?

541
00:39:27.572 --> 00:39:29.162
Hello! Are you coming out
with us tonight?


542
00:39:29.272 --> 00:39:31.363
God!

543
00:39:31.472 --> 00:39:32.801
You know, your door was open again.

544
00:39:32.905 --> 00:39:34.599
You got to get that fixed.

545
00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:38.262
Yeah, I know.

546
00:39:38.372 --> 00:39:40.201
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.


547
00:39:40.305 --> 00:39:42.294
Okay, fun

548
00:39:42.405 --> 00:39:43.802
or whatever the hell you're doing:

549
00:39:43.905 --> 00:39:44.962
it's your choice.

550
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:47.128
Oh, God, it's gone viral already.

551
00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:48.397
Look, I'm sorry.

552
00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:51.130
I'm in tonight, but thanks anyway.

553
00:39:51.238 --> 00:39:53.965
All right, okay. 
Suit yourself.

554
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:56.629
But will you just promise me
you'll lock your door this time?


555
00:39:56.739 --> 00:39:58.568
Yes, I'll lock the door.

556
00:39:58.672 --> 00:40:00.001
Bye.

557
00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:01.469
Okay.

558
00:40:01.572 --> 00:40:03.197
Bye.

559
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:49.103
Hello?

560
00:40:49.205 --> 00:40:52.035
Hello?

561
00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:57.034
Anybody there?

562
00:43:05.638 --> 00:43:07.229
Can I help you?

563
00:43:08.738 --> 00:43:09.795
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:09.905 --> 00:43:11.371
I tried the office, but no one answered.

565
00:43:11.472 --> 00:43:12.369
I was just leaving.

566
00:43:12.472 --> 00:43:13.438
Wait.

567
00:43:13.538 --> 00:43:15.299
You're trespassing.

568
00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:16.995
I could call the cops, you know.

569
00:43:17.105 --> 00:43:21.333
But you, uh...

570
00:43:21.438 --> 00:43:23.563
you look like maybe you like to party.

571
00:43:25.505 --> 00:43:27.494
Excuse me.

572
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:37.894
You smell good.

573
00:43:41.405 --> 00:43:45.167
Like apples.

574
00:43:45.272 --> 00:43:47.931
I like apples.

575
00:43:48.038 --> 00:43:51.061
Yeah?

576
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:54.103
Yeah.

577
00:43:55.205 --> 00:43:56.398
How do you like them apples?

578
00:45:04.038 --> 00:45:06.868
346...

579
00:45:13.105 --> 00:45:15.468
Huh.

580
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:17.560
The Barometer of Morality.

581
00:45:26.405 --> 00:45:28.098
Hmm.

582
00:45:30.238 --> 00:45:34.170
I see 6941.704.

583
00:45:34.272 --> 00:45:39.795
69...694...

584
00:45:39.905 --> 00:45:41.303
Oh, God.

585
00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.962
Oh, Paul, God damn it!

586
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:45.367
A little on edge?

587
00:45:45.471 --> 00:45:46.869
God, a little.

588
00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:49.436
Hey, so are you going
to South Bat tonight or what?


589
00:45:49.537 --> 00:45:51.833
I can't. I'm buried.

590
00:45:51.938 --> 00:45:53.460
Bummer.

591
00:45:53.571 --> 00:45:57.163
All right, I got to go find
my Environmental Economy texts.


592
00:45:57.272 --> 00:45:58.169
Okay.

593
00:45:58.272 --> 00:45:59.260
Don't study too much, okay?

594
00:45:59.372 --> 00:46:01.599
Do you need to unwind a little?

595
00:46:01.704 --> 00:46:03.068
You want to make out?

596
00:46:03.171 --> 00:46:04.068
No!

597
00:47:16.404 --> 00:47:19.859
Hey, I would like to check these out.

598
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:23.698
Hmm, Free Choice Psychology,

599
00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:27.259
Pathology of lrrational Choices,

600
00:47:27.371 --> 00:47:30.337
and Choices: The Barometer of Morality.

601
00:47:30.437 --> 00:47:33.426
All right.

602
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:36.397
Hmm.

603
00:47:36.504 --> 00:47:39.834
These aren't ours.

604
00:47:39.938 --> 00:47:41.165
Excuse me?

605
00:47:41.272 --> 00:47:44.328
Yeah, they're not showing up
in the system.


606
00:47:48.838 --> 00:47:51.702
Next.

607
00:48:04.371 --> 00:48:07.031
Sorry, guys.

608
00:48:07.138 --> 00:48:08.694
I'd prefer more of a tropical landscape,

609
00:48:08.804 --> 00:48:09.701
to be honest with you.

610
00:48:13.005 --> 00:48:14.130
I'm not really sure.

611
00:48:17.537 --> 00:48:18.901
Brian.

612
00:48:19.005 --> 00:48:22.233
Fi, what's up?

613
00:48:22.337 --> 00:48:24.530
Can you check this out for me?

614
00:48:24.638 --> 00:48:26.604
Yeah, sure. Just give me a second.

615
00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:28.000
Sorry, guys. Closing time.

616
00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.695
Got to go. Sorry.

617
00:48:29.804 --> 00:48:31.065
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.


618
00:48:31.171 --> 00:48:32.194
- Thank you.
- See you.


619
00:48:32.304 --> 00:48:34.827
I'll help you with the next one.

620
00:48:34.938 --> 00:48:36.995
Peace. See you, man.

621
00:48:37.105 --> 00:48:38.536
Yeah, come on in.

622
00:48:38.638 --> 00:48:41.297
Take a seat.

623
00:48:41.404 --> 00:48:42.529
Well, what I can tell you is,

624
00:48:42.638 --> 00:48:44.365
is that we have
seven binary identifiers,


625
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:46.596
a constant width module,
and an interweaving matrix.


626
00:48:46.704 --> 00:48:48.499
- English.
- It's barcode.


627
00:48:48.604 --> 00:48:50.093
Yeah, I kind of got that far myself.

628
00:48:50.205 --> 00:48:51.761
Can you look it up?

629
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.137
Yes, I can look it up.

630
00:48:55.237 --> 00:48:57.601
Just give me one second here.

631
00:49:02.038 --> 00:49:05.697
That's weird.

632
00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:12.297
No.

633
00:49:12.404 --> 00:49:16.201
Um...

634
00:49:16.304 --> 00:49:18.702
It's Codabar.

635
00:49:18.804 --> 00:49:20.065
This isn't current barcode.

636
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:21.602
Meaning?

637
00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:23.795
Meaning it's, like,
old linear code used in libraries


638
00:49:23.905 --> 00:49:25.530
way before the digital age.

639
00:49:25.638 --> 00:49:27.195
Nobody uses this anymore.

640
00:49:27.304 --> 00:49:29.930
Where did you get these books?

641
00:49:30.038 --> 00:49:31.901
Can you trace it?

642
00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:33.096
I can try.

643
00:49:33.204 --> 00:49:34.693
Really don't have
much to work with here.


644
00:49:40.437 --> 00:49:42.596
Got nothing here.

645
00:49:42.704 --> 00:49:43.601
Are you sure?

646
00:49:43.704 --> 00:49:44.829
Yep.

647
00:50:03.038 --> 00:50:04.095
The last four numbers

648
00:50:04.204 --> 00:50:06.636
look like the Dewey decimal numbers.

649
00:50:06.738 --> 00:50:08.260
Holy shit.

650
00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:10.530
Who doesn't love a girl who
knows the Dewey decimal system?


651
00:50:10.638 --> 00:50:13.570
Do you think the other numbers
are a branch code, a city,


652
00:50:13.671 --> 00:50:14.932
a state, or something?

653
00:50:15.038 --> 00:50:16.162
Maybe.

654
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:17.601
That's not a bad idea.

655
00:50:21.437 --> 00:50:24.426
What's that number?

656
00:50:27.138 --> 00:50:28.467
Milburn.

657
00:50:28.571 --> 00:50:30.662
That's, like, a half hour from here.

658
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:32.430
Yeah. Let's see.

659
00:50:38.471 --> 00:50:43.597
The only problem is, there are
no libraries in Milburn.


660
00:50:43.704 --> 00:50:46.431
Well, maybe it's a private school,

661
00:50:46.537 --> 00:50:47.560
an old folks' home,

662
00:50:47.671 --> 00:50:49.069
or something else that has a library.

663
00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:50.466
I mean, it's a possibility.

664
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:51.662
But I'm telling you,

665
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.532
the only public institution I see here

666
00:50:53.638 --> 00:50:56.160
is Milburn Juvenile Detention,
and that's about it.


667
00:50:56.271 --> 00:50:57.464
And it closed in 2000.

668
00:50:57.571 --> 00:50:59.469
Where the hell did you get
these books from again?


669
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:01.503
Look up why they closed.

670
00:51:05.938 --> 00:51:07.097
Whoa, holy shit.

671
00:51:07.204 --> 00:51:08.500
"After extensive inquiries,

672
00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:10.866
"charges were never filed
as the evidence was considered


673
00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:12.630
purely circumstantial."

674
00:51:14.437 --> 00:51:16.494
Jesus.

675
00:51:16.604 --> 00:51:18.627
Does that look circumstantial to you?

676
00:51:18.738 --> 00:51:19.761
Absolutely not.

677
00:51:19.871 --> 00:51:21.393
The official story: "The Milburn guards

678
00:51:21.504 --> 00:51:22.561
were cleared of all charges."

679
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:24.637
But they closed the place anyway.

680
00:51:24.738 --> 00:51:26.101
Yep.

681
00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:30.461
These books are from there.

682
00:51:30.571 --> 00:51:31.628
He's from there.

683
00:51:31.738 --> 00:51:33.226
Are you talking about Mr. Choose-it?

684
00:51:33.337 --> 00:51:34.769
How the hell do you know that, Fi?

685
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:39.303
I just know.

686
00:51:41.804 --> 00:51:44.133
Brian, thank you.

687
00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:49.362
So far, the pattern is no pattern.

688
00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:51.369
Hundred miles apart, male, female,

689
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:53.562
different jobs, lifestyles.

690
00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:56.398
The latest DNA check on
the blood tells us what, Alice?


691
00:51:56.504 --> 00:51:58.629
Nothing matches the database so far.

692
00:51:58.738 --> 00:52:01.135
But the maze for Jenna Marlowe

693
00:52:01.237 --> 00:52:03.396
was drawn in Simon Campbell's blood.

694
00:52:03.504 --> 00:52:04.800
He appeared to know all of them,

695
00:52:04.905 --> 00:52:06.200
or at least knew facts about them.

696
00:52:06.304 --> 00:52:07.964
That simply tells us
that he stalked them.


697
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.230
Well, we got to start thinking
about this in a whole new light,


698
00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:13.166
a different angle,
different possibilities.


699
00:52:13.271 --> 00:52:15.863
Maybe the victim isn't the target.

700
00:52:15.971 --> 00:52:17.630
Case in point, young Sara.

701
00:52:17.738 --> 00:52:21.226
What if she's the target
instead of her father?


702
00:52:21.337 --> 00:52:22.735
She brings the killer to the family.

703
00:52:22.838 --> 00:52:23.826
She feels responsible.

704
00:52:23.938 --> 00:52:25.369
She was forced to kill her own father

705
00:52:25.471 --> 00:52:27.027
in front of her mother and brother.

706
00:52:27.137 --> 00:52:29.126
I'm simply suggesting
that we examine this from--


707
00:52:29.237 --> 00:52:31.169
and by the way, when I say "we,"

708
00:52:31.271 --> 00:52:32.794
I'm of course referring to those of us

709
00:52:32.905 --> 00:52:34.700
involved in official police business.

710
00:52:34.804 --> 00:52:35.827
It is my business.

711
00:52:35.938 --> 00:52:38.699
He keeps making it my business.

712
00:52:38.804 --> 00:52:43.259
He just dropped these off
while I was in the library.


713
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:45.132
We just tracked the same thing
a few hours ago,


714
00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:46.635
the same book, in fact.

715
00:52:46.738 --> 00:52:48.704
Yeah, but the real clue
is more where they came from,


716
00:52:48.804 --> 00:52:49.701
not what's in them.

717
00:52:49.804 --> 00:52:51.599
Fi, this is dangerous.

718
00:52:51.704 --> 00:52:53.465
What are you doing
holding on to this stuff?


719
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:57.025
If he wanted to hurt me,
he would have already.


720
00:52:57.137 --> 00:52:59.103
Can't you see that he wants me
personally involved?


721
00:52:59.204 --> 00:53:00.534
He wants me to find out about him,

722
00:53:00.638 --> 00:53:01.831
probably to publicize his story.

723
00:53:01.938 --> 00:53:02.926
Okay, hold it a second.

724
00:53:03.037 --> 00:53:04.401
If he wants a
story on the front page,

725
00:53:04.504 --> 00:53:06.436
he's got a dozen or so
working writers here in town.


726
00:53:06.537 --> 00:53:08.400
Hell, the Times is less
than a hundred miles away.


727
00:53:08.504 --> 00:53:09.595
No offense, but why you?

728
00:53:09.704 --> 00:53:12.727
Look, whatever the reason is,
he chose me.


729
00:53:14.504 --> 00:53:15.800
What have you got?

730
00:53:17.804 --> 00:53:20.668
These books are from Milburn
Juvenile Detention Center.


731
00:53:20.771 --> 00:53:22.134
These barcodes here prove that.

732
00:53:22.237 --> 00:53:23.464
They're actually Codabar,

733
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:26.366
an old system that they used
back in the '70s.


734
00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:28.664
Milburn closed down
more than eight years ago.


735
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:32.203
These books came from there,
so he came from there.


736
00:53:33.771 --> 00:53:34.828
Okay, good work.

737
00:53:34.938 --> 00:53:36.733
We'll check it out.

738
00:53:36.838 --> 00:53:38.098
But for now, everybody goes home,

739
00:53:38.204 --> 00:53:39.864
gets some sleep.

740
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:41.959
Everybody.

741
00:53:59.337 --> 00:54:03.201
You look so very at home sitting there.

742
00:54:03.304 --> 00:54:04.395
I am at home, Dad.

743
00:54:04.504 --> 00:54:05.969
But you know I can't stay here forever.

744
00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.798
Classes and a life, you know.

745
00:54:07.905 --> 00:54:09.393
Yes, I know.

746
00:54:09.504 --> 00:54:10.765
I made some eggs and bacon for you

747
00:54:10.871 --> 00:54:11.802
over there on the counter.

748
00:54:11.905 --> 00:54:13.370
Thank you. I saw that.

749
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.494
I'm just saying it's nice
to see you here; that's all.


750
00:54:15.604 --> 00:54:16.865
And I'm sure you feel safer here.

751
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.061
Yes, I feel safe.

752
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:21.496
More coffee?

753
00:54:21.604 --> 00:54:22.797
Mm-hmm.

754
00:54:28.738 --> 00:54:29.930
Whoa.

755
00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:32.601
- Check this out.
- Well, I would.


756
00:54:32.704 --> 00:54:34.363
You have to make the screen
a little larger.


757
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.732
I'm 107.

758
00:54:35.838 --> 00:54:38.030
All right, let me zoom in.

759
00:54:38.137 --> 00:54:39.228
Holy shit.

760
00:54:39.337 --> 00:54:40.927
Choice therapy?

761
00:54:41.037 --> 00:54:44.935
- Milburn.
- Milburn.


762
00:54:45.037 --> 00:54:47.196
You just kicked the police's ass
with your laptop.


763
00:54:47.304 --> 00:54:48.292
Is that how it works?

764
00:54:48.404 --> 00:54:50.529
Guess where I get it from.

765
00:54:50.638 --> 00:54:53.126
Well, everyone knows that.

766
00:54:57.738 --> 00:54:59.294
Come on. Let's go.

767
00:54:59.404 --> 00:55:00.370
I'm gonna be late.

768
00:55:00.471 --> 00:55:01.767
Wait a minute. What?

769
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.598
I emailed Benson.
He's digging up an address.


770
00:55:03.704 --> 00:55:04.795
He's gonna call us on the cell.

771
00:55:04.904 --> 00:55:07.598
You said "we." There can be no "we."

772
00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.567
Well, you can leave me here

773
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:11.762
and keep guessing what I'm up to,

774
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.803
or you can take me with you
and know for yourself.


775
00:55:14.904 --> 00:55:15.892
Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

776
00:55:16.004 --> 00:55:17.902
Get in the shower.

777
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:11.727
Just for now, okay?

778
00:56:11.837 --> 00:56:12.860
Stay in the car.

779
00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:15.998
Seriously?

780
00:56:18.437 --> 00:56:20.902
Hi-dee-ho.

781
00:56:21.004 --> 00:56:23.129
Come on out.

782
00:56:23.237 --> 00:56:24.294
Scared me.

783
00:56:24.404 --> 00:56:25.768
Oh, sorry.

784
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.927
That's okay.

785
00:56:27.037 --> 00:56:28.628
Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

786
00:56:28.738 --> 00:56:30.397
You already knew that.

787
00:56:30.504 --> 00:56:32.026
Nice to meet you, sir.

788
00:56:32.137 --> 00:56:33.728
You too.

789
00:56:33.837 --> 00:56:37.702
This-a-way we go.

790
00:56:37.803 --> 00:56:39.792
- Just try not to--
- Okay.


791
00:56:41.537 --> 00:56:44.196
Of course, this is in regards
to your work at Milburn.


792
00:56:44.304 --> 00:56:45.429
We've drawn a connection

793
00:56:45.537 --> 00:56:49.469
and hoping that someone
might come to mind,


794
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:51.332
which is why we've come here,

795
00:56:51.437 --> 00:56:54.403
hoping you could narrow the field.

796
00:56:58.504 --> 00:57:01.470
Could be any one of these candidates.

797
00:57:01.571 --> 00:57:06.594
So the rumors, the abuse, was true.

798
00:57:06.704 --> 00:57:11.500
The facts say yes, but the state?

799
00:57:11.604 --> 00:57:13.331
No, ma'am.

800
00:57:13.437 --> 00:57:16.267
Right, sir, but if you
could answer the question--


801
00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:21.894
Oh, I propose that even if
you left here today with a name,


802
00:57:22.004 --> 00:57:23.368
you're no better off.

803
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:25.699
And I propose you underestimate me.

804
00:57:29.337 --> 00:57:31.235
I'm water. You're the horse.

805
00:57:31.337 --> 00:57:32.564
He brought you to me.

806
00:57:32.671 --> 00:57:36.068
The books? Milburn?

807
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.363
He knows you're here.

808
00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:40.437
He wants you to be here.

809
00:57:40.537 --> 00:57:44.025
Under his terms, not yours.

810
00:57:44.137 --> 00:57:45.727
And it's safe to say your choice therapy

811
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:47.928
wasn't exactly a cure-all
for one particular boy.


812
00:57:48.037 --> 00:57:52.060
Hey, I never said it was therapy.

813
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:56.966
And I never, ever said that
it was any kind of a cure-all.


814
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.161
It was more like a barometer

815
00:57:59.271 --> 00:58:03.169
about how the choices
that we make define us.


816
00:58:03.837 --> 00:58:08.860
What better way to understand
how the mind works


817
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:14.665
than by analyzing
the most difficult choices


818
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.702
we have to make?

819
00:58:18.803 --> 00:58:20.792
He chose you.

820
00:58:20.904 --> 00:58:23.132
That's interesting.

821
00:58:23.237 --> 00:58:24.533
So far that I can see,

822
00:58:24.638 --> 00:58:28.660
you're holding up
your part of the bargain.


823
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:30.168
That's also interesting.

824
00:58:30.271 --> 00:58:33.169
Most people would have cut tail
and run by now.


825
00:58:33.271 --> 00:58:35.964
But not you.

826
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:40.503
And he knows that.

827
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:44.058
And I'll tell you something, detective.

828
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:47.432
He's gonna catch you,

829
00:58:47.537 --> 00:58:51.992
and he's gonna catch you
way before you ever catch him.


830
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.063
You believe this guy?

831
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:15.836
There you are.

832
00:59:15.937 --> 00:59:22.995
All you have to do is very
carefully look at the tapes.


833
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:24.729
And you know what?

834
00:59:24.837 --> 00:59:30.566
He's gonna jump off that tape
and tell you exactly who he is.


835
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:36.160
And there is no way
that you will ever stop him.


836
00:59:36.271 --> 00:59:39.260
Thank you, sir.

837
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.166
Take care.

838
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.634
Be careful.

839
00:59:49.637 --> 00:59:51.899
And you, sir?

840
00:59:52.004 --> 00:59:54.936
Be warned.

841
00:59:59.337 --> 01:00:01.269
The choice is now

842
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:04.030
snap her neck and leave immediately,

843
01:00:04.137 --> 01:00:09.365
or stay here for another ten years.

844
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:11.868
What's your answer now?

845
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.402
I'd kill you before I'd kill this dog,

846
01:00:13.504 --> 01:00:17.231
you sick old fuck.

847
01:00:17.337 --> 01:00:19.235
I'm gonna reach over
and break your neck.


848
01:00:19.337 --> 01:00:21.825
Do I get the money then
or just another ten years?


849
01:00:21.937 --> 01:00:23.130
- That'll be all.
- Fuck you.


850
01:00:23.237 --> 01:00:25.396
See, this kid I like.

851
01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:27.435
That's done.

852
01:00:27.537 --> 01:00:30.469
Here's the last one.

853
01:00:32.437 --> 01:00:33.494
Yeah, I like her.

854
01:00:33.603 --> 01:00:35.967
Let me ask you a question.

855
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:41.798
If I were to offer you $1,000
to snap her neck, would you?


856
01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.995
No.

857
01:00:44.104 --> 01:00:46.127
Are you sure?

858
01:00:46.237 --> 01:00:48.759
I wouldn't hurt Molly. 
Would I, girl?

859
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:52.768
Just 'cause I'm in here doesn't
make me what you think I am.


860
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:57.064
Let's make it $10,000.

861
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.533
You're playing a game.

862
01:00:58.637 --> 01:00:59.694
I get it.

863
01:00:59.803 --> 01:01:02.292
A simple choice. Yes or no?

864
01:01:05.337 --> 01:01:07.303
No, I wouldn't.

865
01:01:07.404 --> 01:01:09.097
What if I informed you

866
01:01:09.204 --> 01:01:12.102
that she was scheduled
to be put down anyway


867
01:01:12.204 --> 01:01:14.227
later this afternoon at the pound?

868
01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.326
Nothing you can do to stop it.

869
01:01:16.437 --> 01:01:19.460
Then would you take the $10,000?

870
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:21.298
No, I'm not a monster.

871
01:01:21.404 --> 01:01:23.835
$100,000?

872
01:01:23.937 --> 01:01:26.165
I said no. Now leave me alone.

873
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:29.566
The choice is now.

874
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.568
Snap her neck and leave immediately,

875
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:38.399
or stay here for another ten years.

876
01:01:38.503 --> 01:01:41.265
Please choose.

877
01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.529
What have you done?

878
01:01:48.637 --> 01:01:50.365
My God! Jesus, stop the tape!

879
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.561
So I guess I'm free to go.

880
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:55.398
Stop the tape!

881
01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.163
Holy shit. What's that kid's name?

882
01:01:57.271 --> 01:02:00.135
Yeah, what is that kid's name?

883
01:02:00.237 --> 01:02:03.691
Uh, Nathan Jones.

884
01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.928
Nathan Jones?

885
01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:11.269
All right, adopted when he was
two months old.


886
01:02:11.371 --> 01:02:13.928
The adopted parents returned
the kid to child services


887
01:02:14.037 --> 01:02:15.230
when he was three years old.

888
01:02:15.337 --> 01:02:17.894
Mentally unstable. Destructive.

889
01:02:18.004 --> 01:02:19.594
How destructive can you be at three?

890
01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:22.192
I guess destructive enough
for the state to take him back.


891
01:02:22.304 --> 01:02:24.236
It's pretty goddamn destructive
for that to happen,


892
01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:25.394
don't you think, boss?

893
01:02:25.503 --> 01:02:26.992
Yeah, I never heard of that happening.

894
01:02:27.104 --> 01:02:29.332
Does it say anything else about
what happens to the kid next?


895
01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:30.868
Yeah, let me see.

896
01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:32.402
After several years in an orphanage,

897
01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:34.231
he was finally placed in foster care.

898
01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:35.597
And get this.

899
01:02:35.703 --> 01:02:38.464
His foster dad was
Simon Campbell, the musician.


900
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.230
It says here that there are
allegations of sexual abuse.


901
01:02:41.337 --> 01:02:44.303
It was five months before he was
moved out of Campbell's care.


902
01:02:44.403 --> 01:02:45.960
Oh, Jesus.

903
01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:47.366
And then he was placed in the home

904
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:49.834
of Martin and Melinda Marlow.

905
01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:51.994
He lived with the Marlows
for only two years


906
01:02:52.104 --> 01:02:55.433
before their daughter Jenna
accused him of rape.


907
01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:57.025
Charges were never proven.

908
01:02:57.137 --> 01:03:00.001
And Nathan was removed from their home.

909
01:03:00.104 --> 01:03:01.626
Shit.

910
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:02.725
Then he entered Milburn.

911
01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:05.530
That's when the real shit started.

912
01:03:05.637 --> 01:03:07.297
Hey, boss. We got an address.

913
01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:10.370
Let's go right now.

914
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:11.993
No, no, no, not you.
Where are you going?


915
01:03:12.104 --> 01:03:13.501
You stay here, okay?

916
01:03:13.603 --> 01:03:15.297
You've done good work,
so keep following it.


917
01:03:15.403 --> 01:03:16.767
Alice can help you.

918
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.166
Alice, you'll make sure she stays?

919
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:20.032
For my peace of mind.

920
01:03:20.137 --> 01:03:21.194
Okay.

921
01:03:21.304 --> 01:03:23.963
Just stay.

922
01:03:42.603 --> 01:03:44.762
Oh, my God. What took you so long?

923
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:46.495
Ever since the power
went out last night,


924
01:03:46.603 --> 01:03:48.297
it stinks to high heaven in there.

925
01:03:48.403 --> 01:03:50.165
It's absolutely disgusting, right?

926
01:03:50.271 --> 01:03:51.736
It's disgusting in there.

927
01:03:51.837 --> 01:03:53.201
- Please.
- We got it.


928
01:03:53.304 --> 01:03:56.127
- Did you call the power company?
- Stay back.


929
01:03:56.237 --> 01:03:58.963
- Everybody's disgusted with the smell.
- Stay back.


930
01:04:10.436 --> 01:04:13.493
Okay, boys, break it down.

931
01:04:13.603 --> 01:04:14.728
Ready?

932
01:04:18.737 --> 01:04:19.794
Police, open up!

933
01:04:19.904 --> 01:04:22.870
Hey, police!

934
01:04:42.204 --> 01:04:43.135
All right.

935
01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:46.999
Uniforms, I want you to file through.

936
01:04:47.104 --> 01:04:48.831
- Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.


937
01:04:50.837 --> 01:04:51.894
It smells like shit in here.

938
01:04:52.004 --> 01:04:54.629
Quiet, quiet, shh.

939
01:05:01.904 --> 01:05:03.597
Jesus, I can't take the stench.

940
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.031
Ugh.

941
01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:10.329
Oh, fuck me.

942
01:05:10.436 --> 01:05:13.368
I don't even want to know
what that shit is.


943
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:15.096
Fuck me.

944
01:05:22.536 --> 01:05:25.525
Ken, check the back.

945
01:05:32.603 --> 01:05:35.967
Holy Christ.

946
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:38.467
Get forensics here right away.

947
01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:40.661
Jesus.

948
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.758
Find Wagner.

949
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:42.858
Get him down here.

950
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:45.868
He's got to see this.

951
01:05:56.236 --> 01:05:57.134
Chief?

952
01:05:57.236 --> 01:05:58.259
Yeah.

953
01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:00.962
You better come take a look at this.

954
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:02.399
Worse than in here?

955
01:06:02.503 --> 01:06:04.969
A little bit.

956
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.368
You all right?

957
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:10.458
No.

958
01:07:18.004 --> 01:07:19.867
ISO_17.

959
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:22.128
Isolation room 17?

960
01:07:37.737 --> 01:07:39.202
This thing caused the fuse

961
01:07:39.303 --> 01:07:41.235
to blow the mains
on the entire building.


962
01:07:41.336 --> 01:07:42.597
Mm-hmm.

963
01:07:42.703 --> 01:07:44.362
Which in turn shut off
these air fresheners


964
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.868
designed to mask the stench.

965
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:48.027
We found his dog locked up
in his bathroom over there.


966
01:07:48.136 --> 01:07:50.102
Dog by the name of Molly?

967
01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:51.362
Yeah.

968
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:55.425
I can't even describe that next part.

969
01:07:55.536 --> 01:07:57.161
Jesus, who the fuck is that?

970
01:07:57.270 --> 01:08:00.032
That is who we believe
is Dr. Ronald Pendleton.


971
01:08:00.136 --> 01:08:01.602
We found his ID under the tub.

972
01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.532
Forensics is running a check on it.

973
01:08:03.637 --> 01:08:05.432
I think you're gonna find
the next revelation


974
01:08:05.536 --> 01:08:06.832
a little more disturbing.

975
01:08:06.937 --> 01:08:07.834
Yeah? Why's that?

976
01:08:07.937 --> 01:08:09.994
I'll show you.

977
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:17.002
From the looks of it, you were next.

978
01:08:36.503 --> 01:08:37.799
Jesus.

979
01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:48.559
Hey, you've reached Fiona.

980
01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:49.931
Please leave a message.

981
01:08:50.036 --> 01:08:51.059
Fiona, Dad.

982
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.362
Listen, I have some news.

983
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:54.697
I need to talk to you.

984
01:08:54.803 --> 01:08:56.632
You got to call me back
as soon as you get this.


985
01:08:56.737 --> 01:08:59.100
All right, bye.

986
01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:00.328
Yeah, I still can't reach her.

987
01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:04.562
So, boss, listen.

988
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.567
What if this guy--

989
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:07.858
Hey, boss.

990
01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:47.132
Hello?

991
01:10:47.236 --> 01:10:50.225
Anybody here?

992
01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:19.494
Hello?

993
01:12:16.236 --> 01:12:18.202
Oh.

994
01:12:56.703 --> 01:12:58.669
Open the door!

995
01:12:58.770 --> 01:12:59.792
Hello, Fiona.

996
01:12:59.903 --> 01:13:01.699
Let me out of here!

997
01:13:01.802 --> 01:13:05.701
Welcome to a special place
for bad little children.


998
01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:10.167
Don't be overly concerned
with Milburn's date rape drug.


999
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:11.792
Open this door!

1000
01:13:11.903 --> 01:13:15.358
It's a harmless little gas
that will knock you right out.


1001
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:17.867
See you when you wake up.

1002
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.527
Look who's awake.

1003
01:14:28.303 --> 01:14:34.031
Your father made our mother choose.

1004
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:37.034
Your father, our mother.

1005
01:14:37.136 --> 01:14:38.602
Do you get it?

1006
01:14:38.702 --> 01:14:40.498
I don't understand.

1007
01:14:40.603 --> 01:14:44.365
When your father Tom
was away at the academy,


1008
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.436
she met my dad.

1009
01:14:46.536 --> 01:14:48.661
I was conceived right here in this room.

1010
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:55.164
Tom said he wouldn't raise
another man's child.


1011
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:59.396
He made her choose.

1012
01:14:59.503 --> 01:15:04.333
You weren't even born yet,
and she chose you over me.


1013
01:15:04.436 --> 01:15:06.833
She told me it was the hardest choice

1014
01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.868
she ever had to make.

1015
01:15:09.969 --> 01:15:12.527
But I gave her
one that was even harder,

1016
01:15:12.637 --> 01:15:16.034
and she made the ultimate sacrifice

1017
01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:18.329
for you, Fiona.

1018
01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:21.663
She chose to die so you could live.

1019
01:15:21.769 --> 01:15:23.565
You killed her.

1020
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:25.602
You killed her and made it
look like a suicide.


1021
01:15:25.702 --> 01:15:26.600
No.

1022
01:15:26.702 --> 01:15:28.328
I gave her a choice.

1023
01:15:28.436 --> 01:15:30.197
She killed herself.

1024
01:15:30.303 --> 01:15:33.928
It can't be.

1025
01:15:34.036 --> 01:15:36.093
You should feel special, Fiona.

1026
01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:38.294
No one ever did that for me.

1027
01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:42.460
Why are you doing this to me, Nathan?

1028
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:44.297
Look, I understand why you're angry.

1029
01:15:44.403 --> 01:15:45.460
You have every right to be.

1030
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.160
But why am I here?

1031
01:15:57.969 --> 01:16:02.163
You think I'm ugly, don't you?

1032
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:04.827
I'm not as pretty as you.

1033
01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:08.528
It's no wonder she chose you.

1034
01:16:08.636 --> 01:16:11.159
Three years ago,

1035
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.361
after our mother died,

1036
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:18.493
I put a gun in my mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.


1037
01:16:18.602 --> 01:16:23.591
When I woke up, 
I looked like this.

1038
01:16:23.702 --> 01:16:25.861
Pendleton was right.

1039
01:16:25.969 --> 01:16:28.492
Our choices define us.

1040
01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:38.961
Dad.

1041
01:16:39.069 --> 01:16:40.694
Didn't you ever wonder
why he was so quick


1042
01:16:40.802 --> 01:16:42.893
to put her in the grave
and forget the whole thing?


1043
01:16:43.003 --> 01:16:43.991
Dad, can you hear me?

1044
01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:45.330
It must have been pretty painful

1045
01:16:45.436 --> 01:16:46.924
that this is where she had
to end her life.


1046
01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.059
Dad, Dad!

1047
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:49.465
I wanted you to know the truth.

1048
01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.728
I wanted you to hear it from him.

1049
01:16:51.836 --> 01:16:53.325
Dad, can you hear me?

1050
01:16:53.436 --> 01:16:55.334
Go ahead and ask him.

1051
01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.368
Ask him, Fiona.

1052
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:59.436
Go ahead, ask him!

1053
01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:01.092
Ask him!

1054
01:17:01.203 --> 01:17:03.101
Ask him what he did!

1055
01:17:11.769 --> 01:17:13.360
Is it true?

1056
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:17.300
Was there a baby before I was born?

1057
01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:21.660
You know I love you more than anything.

1058
01:17:27.569 --> 01:17:30.558
Nathan, stop!

1059
01:17:34.602 --> 01:17:35.966
Nathan, I'm begging you, please!

1060
01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:40.161
Look at me, Nathan!

1061
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:41.735
Nathan!

1062
01:17:43.069 --> 01:17:46.433
Nathan, please!

1063
01:17:46.535 --> 01:17:47.467
Nathan, stop!

1064
01:17:52.036 --> 01:17:54.468
Nathan, please!

1065
01:18:00.936 --> 01:18:02.492
No, no, no, no!

1066
01:18:02.602 --> 01:18:06.365
No, no, no, Dad.

1067
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:07.560
Come on, it's okay.

1068
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:09.033
Breathe.

1069
01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:10.692
No, no.

1070
01:18:10.802 --> 01:18:13.064
No, no, no.

1071
01:18:13.169 --> 01:18:16.329
No, no.

1072
01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:22.461
No, come on, no!

1073
01:18:22.569 --> 01:18:25.592
No!

1074
01:18:49.736 --> 01:18:52.930
thud!

1075
01:20:36.402 --> 01:20:39.630
Hey, lady, you okay?

1076
01:20:39.736 --> 01:20:42.395
You need some help?

1077
01:20:49.569 --> 01:20:51.330
I forgot to tell you

1078
01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:54.333
how much you remind me of your mother.

1079
01:20:55.931 --> 01:21:05.921
