00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.586
This film is a work of fiction.

2
00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:36.965
Names, characters, places and incidents
are a product of filmmakers' imagination.


3
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.887
Honorable citizens of Korea,

4
00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:43.847
it's been 20 years!

5
00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:47.141
20 years since I dove into

6
00:00:47.142 --> 00:00:49.686
the world of politics,
I, Jeon Hae-woong,


7
00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:52.313
will become a congressman.

8
00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:54.315
I may not have much,

9
00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:57.777
but I will not compromise
to lies and injustice,


10
00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:03.032
and I'll become a just politician
who will side with the weak!


11
00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.492
With a landslide victory,

12
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:09.581
I will thank and repay
you for your votes!


13
00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:13.209
This is not my victory alone,

14
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.919
it is our victory,

15
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.800
moreover, it will be a victory for
Republic of Korea's democracy!


16
00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:25.430
Well, well... "Republic of
Korea" seems too much.

26
00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:15.229
Redevelopment is always part
of every election campaign.


27
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.691
Do they also plant trees
that grow money?


28
00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:20.276
Sons of bitches.

29
00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:22.278
They'll announce it,

30
00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.612
jack up the land value,

31
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:26.198
kick out the residents!

32
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.951
And they'll fill up their
own pot bellies, not?


33
00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.452
Those bastards...

34
00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:31.537
Am I right, Rep. Jeon?

35
00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:35.668
They can't redevelop on a
whim like they did before.


36
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:40.129
The world has changed, and
so has Democratic Party.


37
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.508
And Busan's Haeundae has
me, what's there to worry?


38
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.551
Is this better?

39
00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:48.179
You're the problem!

40
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.597
Because pricks like you
are getting into politics!


41
00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:52.434
Honey, long time no see...

42
00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:54.894
See?

43
00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:57.146
That's what you say to your wife?

44
00:02:57.147 --> 00:02:59.315
Honey bun, don't say that
on this wonderful day.


45
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.192
How about we take

46
00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:02.151
Good! Break time.

47
00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:04.070
No, let's just get it
over with, I'm busy.


48
00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.321
- Hurry, hurry.
- She's busy.


49
00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:07.281
- Busy?
- Yeah, very.


50
00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:09.533
- I'll stand on this side.
- Yes, very nice.


51
00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:11.286
All right, one, two.

52
00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.246
Raise your hand.

53
00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:16.623
Come home for once, mother's sick.

54
00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:17.666
Again?

55
00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:21.128
Probably faking it
since she misses you.


56
00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.880
All right, that's enough.

57
00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:26.258
She must really love her son
who doesn't make any money.


58
00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:27.218
Come on, smile.

59
00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.887
You'll be the wife of
a congressman soon.


60
00:03:29.888 --> 00:03:32.223
Once I get this win, you'll
get your own driver.


61
00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.017
I'll also win 3, 4 terms and more!

62
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:37.937
I don't need all that, just
get your shit together.


63
00:03:37.938 --> 00:03:39.646
Can't we live ordinary lives?

64
00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:42.775
I'm not doing this for my own sake.

65
00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:45.778
- It's for the good of Korea...
- Are we done?


66
00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.197
Yeah, done, all done.

67
00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:49.949
Yeah, I guess so...

68
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.159
- We got plenty.
- More than enough.


69
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.620
Very well.

70
00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:56.999
Leaving so soon? 
Not gonna have lunch?

71
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.960
This is for meals, not booze!

72
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:04.131
It's a sure thing, once
I get the party nom.


73
00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:07.342
A nomination equals elected!

74
00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:11.596
Let's take 5.

75
00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:13.849

- Let's go up.


84

- You must be tired.
- Not at all.


85
00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:50.634
Redevelopment?

86
00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:53.971
Is that as easy as
drawing a line on a map?


87
00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:55.848
So what's happening now?

88
00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.352
Even the president
is floating the idea!


89
00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:01.854
What will happen then?

90
00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.566
All the rich folks in the country,

91
00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:09.570
developers and big construction
companies will zero in!


92
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:11.238
So, what do we do about it?

93
00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:14.158
They'll come with bundles
of cash and shovels!


94
00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.285
Should we sell our land?

95
00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:17.244
No way!

96
00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:20.915
Don't ever sell your land
and resist at all costs!


97
00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.835
Who will be kicked out
of our homes? Us!


98
00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:25.627
- Who'll get the boot?
- Us!


99
00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:27.171
- Who?
- Us!


100
00:05:27.172 --> 00:05:29.049
- Madame, who?
- Us!


101
00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:32.093
When I'm elected,

102
00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:34.178
I'll become the voice of you all,

103
00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:38.766
and fight this with everything I got!

104

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.907
Combined with general
election, we're looking at $1B.


112
00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:58.035
Don't you know the legal limit
for presidential campaign fund?


113
00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:00.872
It's under $40M, $36.7M to be exact.

114
00:06:00.873 --> 00:06:04.251
What kind of idiot put on a
campaign with that money?


115
00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:09.713
Losing the general election means
losing the presidential election.


116

This is our only option at the moment.

Use this to for seed money,

119
00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.519
and once we increase the ratings,
corporations will back us.


120
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.356
Busan port is at its limit,
so development is crucial,

Are we in the '70s?

You can't dabble into everything.

129
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.350
You must focus on one district

No, that's not what I meant...

Got any insider tip?

00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:58.299
Rep. Jeon is here!

162
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.966
- Good to see you.
- Have you been well?


163
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:00.967
You came!

164
00:09:01.344 --> 00:09:02.553
I'm sorry for being late, sir.

165
00:09:02.554 --> 00:09:03.762
Not at all.

166
00:09:03.763 --> 00:09:06.432
You're bound for greatness,
just you being here is a boon.


167
00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:07.474
- Hey there.
- Hello.


168
00:09:07.475 --> 00:09:08.810
- Rep. Jeon.
- Sir.


169
00:09:10.437 --> 00:09:12.939
Hey, it's been a while,
I heard you were busy.


170
00:09:13.606 --> 00:09:16.942
You're the busiest
man, and he's second.


171
00:09:16.943 --> 00:09:18.278
I'm not that busy at all.

172
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:20.321
Good to see you here.

173
00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:23.574
When you go to the congress,
it'll be harder to see you.


174
00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:25.659
I'll have to visit more often.

175
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.119
Very good.

176
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.206
Alums have to stick together
and help each other out.


177
00:09:30.207 --> 00:09:31.541
Yes, that's right!

178
00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:35.377
I'm so proud of you two.

179
00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:36.962
You're the real stars of Busan.

180
00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:37.963
Not at all...

181
00:09:37.964 --> 00:09:39.466
Speaking of which...

182
00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:44.887
Attention everyone!

183
00:09:46.848 --> 00:09:48.224
Hae-woong, come on, get up.

184
00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:49.726
Yes, of course.

185
00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:54.938
Our proud alum Jeon Hae-woong,

186
00:09:54.939 --> 00:10:01.113
will be running for office
at the 14th general election!


187
00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:05.742
I'll do my best!

188
00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:08.495
All right!

189
00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:12.790
Raise your glasses!

190
00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:16.711
- We're no!
- Strangers!


191
00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:38.149
Why didn't she put it away?

192
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.858
I'm just saying you got a cute kid.

193
00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:42.069
Don't you pull that
gangster crap on me!


194
00:10:43.488 --> 00:10:45.822
What's going on, honey?

195
00:10:45.823 --> 00:10:47.616
Hey! Let go of her!

196
00:10:47.617 --> 00:10:49.410
- Let go!
- Your daddy's here.


197
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:50.411
Let her go!

198
00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:51.454
Let her go, asshole!

199
00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:54.790
Who the hell are you?

200
00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:56.375
Your creditor, obviously!

201
00:10:56.376 --> 00:10:58.460
Creditor? Screw that!

202
00:10:58.461 --> 00:10:59.712
Get over here!

203
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.217
Don't be so touchy, you disgusting pig.

204
00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:08.679
Do you know who I am?
How dare you come here!


205
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.930
Honey!

206
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:11.599
Let go of me!

207
00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:17.397
What are you doing to our VIP?

208
00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:20.357
It's not like we're hooligans.

209
00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:21.358
But we're...

210
00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:29.116
- Let me help you up.
- Piss off!


211
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.953
Is he okay?

212
00:11:35.707 --> 00:11:37.624
My apologies.

213
00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:40.002
My boys are a
bit on the dumb side.

214
00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:45.258
But Rep. Jeon, what'll you do?

215
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.760
We lend you the money
as a show of support


216
00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:51.763
thinking that you'd get the nomination.

217
00:11:51.764 --> 00:11:54.057
But that went to shit,

218
00:11:54.058 --> 00:11:56.353
too bad for you.

219
00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:01.483
Nomination? What did you say?

220
00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:03.191
Are you nuts?

221
00:12:03.192 --> 00:12:06.821
You didn't know?

222
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.075
You're not in the know?

223
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.161
You're in politics, no less.

224
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.970
Politics isn't some bandwagon,

225
00:12:31.513 --> 00:12:34.265
how do you just kick
someone off overnight?


226
00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:35.808
I'm lost for words!

227
00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:38.144
Mr. Kwon!

228
00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:43.899
This is the crappiest horse
shit I've ever heard, spill it!


229
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.985
You didn't listen and blabbered
on to the residents.


230
00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:49.738
If I'm not siding with them,
why am I in politics?


231
00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:52.908
Listening to people's
wailings is politics?


232
00:12:52.909 --> 00:12:54.494
Is that how I taught you?

233
00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:59.290
So you replaced me
with an obedient dog?


234
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.293
You know the pawns in chess?

235
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:04.003
Do you know what they're for?

236
00:13:04.962 --> 00:13:08.090
You use them and kill
them when you want to.


237
00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:13.513
Are you saying I'm a pawn?!

238
00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:16.974
What did you think you were?

239
00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:25.316
Jesus, this really hurts.

240
00:13:25.317 --> 00:13:26.567
You didn't know?

241
00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:30.112
The world is dirty, and life's a bitch.

242
00:13:32.574 --> 00:13:34.282
Wait, no, I...

243
00:13:34.283 --> 00:13:37.077
How many years have
I cleaned your shit?


244
00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:38.245
A while.

245
00:13:38.746 --> 00:13:41.791
Sir, this is all wrong,
let's start over, okay?


246
00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:44.460
Mr. Kwon, this is Haeundae!

247
00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:48.547
I will not lose to some nobody
in this district, you know that.


248
00:13:48.548 --> 00:13:49.632
Help me out.

249
00:13:50.257 --> 00:13:54.428
I, Jeon Hae-woong,
will kneel before you!


250
00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:57.306
First time, right? 
Please help me.

251
00:13:58.683 --> 00:14:02.143
Kneeling really isn't a big deal.

252

to you, I'm Park Yong-sik.

Jeez...

254
00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:24.125
You should've mentioned
my replacement was here.


255
00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:32.174
Let's get it on then.

256
00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:35.678
It'll be fun.

257
00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:06.668
Why? Why?!

258
00:15:07.835 --> 00:15:08.835
Why?!

259
00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:14.216
Let's see who drops dead first!

260
00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:15.885

When this blows up, it won't
be just us who get screwed.

The entire country
will go up in flames.

$300,000 in a week, good?

268
00:16:48.102 --> 00:16:53.315
In addition to that, I should
be getting a promotion.

What are you doing?!

272
00:17:50.331 --> 00:17:51.832
Having lunch?

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.834

Politicians sure are
on a different scale.


277
00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:08.473
You got a big appetite
and even bigger balls.

I've been around the

I will never lose to a nobody.

Sure, I know that, but...

286
00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:34.333
But us businessmen don't trust people.

287
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:38.629
To be frank, $1M is like 10 apartments.

288
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.092
People in politics tend
to underestimate money.

We make money by getting
stabbed and going to jail.

live by sucking blood?

Hey.

Say hello, this is candidate

I finally get to meet
a local celebrity.


307
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.317
It's an honor.

308
00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:27.195
Yellow Dragon

309
00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:28.405
Good to meet you.

310
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.451
You two know the situation,

311
00:20:32.994 --> 00:20:34.703
let's get to the point.

312
00:20:35.747 --> 00:20:40.584
Pil-do, you're a big boy
now, taking the lead here.


313
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.089
If you're appreciative, just say so.

314
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.509
Keep it up and you may regret it.

315
00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:53.014
And the one leading isn't
me, it's candidate Jeon.


316
00:20:56.183 --> 00:20:57.934
All right, let's talk business.

317
00:20:57.935 --> 00:21:00.772
Certainly, take a look at this first.

318
00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:05.067
It's a hot intel straight
from the city hall.


319
00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.487
As you can see, these
are nothing but cream.

Gosh, sorry to keep you waiting.

374
00:25:32.793 --> 00:25:35.129
We had to tour the Jaesong district.

375
00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:38.424
So, you're the reporter, huh?

376
00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:41.385
They sent a nobody...

377
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:45.056
How long have you worked as a reporter?

378
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.183
2 years now.

379
00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:50.310
Is that a problem?

380
00:25:50.311 --> 00:25:53.104
No, why'd that be a problem?

381
00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:55.774
To be honest, aren't
you the bigger nobody?


382
00:25:56.442 --> 00:25:58.610
You're a feisty one.

383
00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:01.697
How did you fail to clench
the Democratic Party nom?


384
00:26:02.614 --> 00:26:05.284
I really like you, Ms. Song Dana.

385
00:26:06.202 --> 00:26:08.995
How should I put this,

386
00:26:09.955 --> 00:26:13.292
it could be interpreted
as difference in vision.


387
00:26:16.128 --> 00:26:18.422
- A cup of coffee?
- Yeah, sure.


388
00:26:21.342 --> 00:26:22.926
I heard you were kicked out?

389
00:26:25.387 --> 00:26:27.764
That is one interpretation
of what happened.


390
00:26:28.265 --> 00:26:29.516
The real truth is,

391
00:26:30.476 --> 00:26:34.729
it was a textbook case of nepotism,

392
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.442
during the time when the
president is proclaiming that


393
00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:41.444
he only wants "fair election."

394
00:26:41.445 --> 00:26:45.574
I'm the victim of
political machination.


395
00:26:47.576 --> 00:26:52.581
You must've felt wronged,
you're just a naïve sheep.


396
00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:55.792
It's all right.

397
00:26:56.335 --> 00:26:59.837
I'm not someone who dwell on the past.

398
00:26:59.838 --> 00:27:03.800
There's bound to be trouble
when our goals don't align.


399
00:27:06.553 --> 00:27:10.974
A man of justice who
threw away vested rights?


400
00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:13.351
That's not bad.

401
00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:16.147
How about something that
encapsulates my life...


402
00:27:16.772 --> 00:27:20.483
Champion of democracy,
yeah, let's go with that.


403
00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:22.569
- Champion of democracy.
- Yeah, that's right.


404
00:27:23.654 --> 00:27:28.741
When I was in college,
I participated in protests.


405
00:27:28.742 --> 00:27:31.786
I get cold sweat thinking
about those days.


406

414
00:27:59.147 --> 00:28:01.566

be good at one of two things:


415
00:28:01.567 --> 00:28:04.277
suck up or blow off the cover.

Still working? 
Is our son asleep?

483

No.

I feel bad for people with
you in the congress.

Honey, there's nothing to it.

490

What?

495
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.665
This is for the last
time, or it's a divorce.

- What's the point?


503

Mr. Jeon was watching.

504

509
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.716
You didn't have to buy so much.

510
00:38:52.717 --> 00:38:54.844
Take this, put it there.

511

Here, you all worked so hard.

512

Thank you!

513
00:39:00.475 --> 00:39:03.560
Losing is one thing,
we still have to go on.


514

You're so right!

515
00:39:05.605 --> 00:39:07.940
This isn't the end of
it, let's have a drink.


516
00:39:07.941 --> 00:39:10.484
That's right, 4 years is short.

517
00:39:10.485 --> 00:39:12.862

"Fought hard"?

521
00:39:28.378 --> 00:39:31.255
When you fight and lose,
you either become a cripple,


522

die, or die as a cripple.

523
00:39:34.259 --> 00:39:36.843
You sure take this freaking lightly.

524

The land you said to buy
up became worthless.

00:49:28.936 --> 00:49:31.354
Do you even know
what a predicament is?!


644
00:49:31.355 --> 00:49:34.357
Then what? What do
you want me to do?

645
00:49:34.358 --> 00:49:36.109
I got an order from upstairs!

646
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.071
What am I supposed to do?!

647
00:49:44.284 --> 00:49:45.285
Who?

648
00:49:47.204 --> 00:49:48.247
Upstairs who?

649
00:49:48.998 --> 00:49:52.166
I don't know! How would I know?!

650
00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:53.586
I've never seen him before...

651
00:49:59.383 --> 00:50:02.176
- Son of a bitch...
- You bastard!


652
00:50:02.177 --> 00:50:06.347
To be goddamn honest,
you didn't get elected!


653
00:50:06.348 --> 00:50:08.057
You ain't got the power to protect me!

654
00:50:08.058 --> 00:50:09.433
Goddamn you!

655
00:50:09.434 --> 00:50:13.437
Is that why you started licking
someone else's asshole?!


656
00:50:13.438 --> 00:50:15.899
It hurts, my head...

657
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.484
Here, give it a go.

658
00:50:20.029 --> 00:50:21.237
What?

659
00:50:21.238 --> 00:50:25.199
Don't just talk the talk,
mess him up for real.


660
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.287
Let's see if you got your
story straight with him.


661
00:50:29.288 --> 00:50:31.956
What do you take me for?!

662
00:50:31.957 --> 00:50:34.418
Then you have to prove yourself,

663
00:50:35.085 --> 00:50:36.170
am I right?

664
00:51:14.083 --> 00:51:16.835
You'll really kill him!
We still need information.


665
00:51:16.836 --> 00:51:18.713
Let go of me!

666
00:51:22.257 --> 00:51:23.341
Get him!

667
00:51:23.342 --> 00:51:25.052
Piss off, asshole!

668
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.683
You took me for a swindler?
You bastard!


669
00:51:32.267 --> 00:51:33.267
Shit, let go.

670
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:35.312
That's enough, stop it!

671
00:51:35.813 --> 00:51:37.397
Get off of me.

672
00:51:39.859 --> 00:51:43.445
You two, follow my orders.

673
00:51:44.488 --> 00:51:46.906
I have a plan,

674
00:51:46.907 --> 00:51:50.995
follow my orders to the
tee, you hear me?!


675
00:51:51.578 --> 00:51:55.374
I'll take full responsibility!

676
00:51:57.209 --> 00:51:58.961
All right.

677
00:51:59.879 --> 00:52:01.714
It's all settled then.

678
00:52:31.118 --> 00:52:32.662
- Good morning.
- Hey.


679
00:52:33.287 --> 00:52:34.287
Good morning.

680
00:52:35.039 --> 00:52:36.080
Good morning.

681
00:52:36.081 --> 00:52:37.081
Ms. Song!

682
00:52:37.917 --> 00:52:39.001
One moment, please?

683
00:52:40.961 --> 00:52:41.961
Yes?

684
00:52:42.504 --> 00:52:44.965
Say hello, you've met him.

685
00:52:48.552 --> 00:52:49.720
Have you had breakfast?

686
00:52:50.888 --> 00:52:52.638
I don't eat breakfast.

687
00:52:52.639 --> 00:52:55.350
Let's go have a meal, brunch then.

688
00:52:55.851 --> 00:52:58.979
Go with him, he's got a tip.

689
00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:02.107
A tip of public interest.

690
00:53:15.079 --> 00:53:17.663
If you had enough, can we start?

691
00:53:17.664 --> 00:53:19.165
May I record?

692
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:20.166
Not gonna have more?

693
00:53:24.797 --> 00:53:29.133
Very well, here, write exactly as is.

694
00:53:29.134 --> 00:53:31.052
I'm too old for dictation.

695
00:53:31.053 --> 00:53:35.390
Give it a read, don't
drop your jaw in shock.

Proposed new city plan
was changed overnight.


698
00:53:50.072 --> 00:53:53.408
By Korea's top or just below him.

699
00:53:53.993 --> 00:53:55.618
It's not even surprising, really.

700
00:53:55.619 --> 00:53:58.622
Same things happened
for Gangnam in the '70s.


701
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.500
Who's the whistleblower?

702
00:54:02.501 --> 00:54:05.544
I can vouch for the source,
so don't worry about that.


703
00:54:05.545 --> 00:54:06.922
What about the evidence?

704
00:54:11.218 --> 00:54:17.391

Will this get you money?

to make a living, no?


719
00:55:40.557 --> 00:55:43.434
One went dark, the
other's being stubborn,


720

725
00:55:59.118 --> 00:56:02.496
You'll regret this.

726
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:08.626
This would be threat and intimidation.

727

Son of a bitch, you listen now.

728

What?

738
00:56:52.964 --> 00:56:56.840
I mean, Jeon didn't get elected,

739
00:56:56.841 --> 00:57:00.594
legally speaking,
you'll be charged with

Pil-do, it's me, listen carefully.

746

Jung spilled his guts to a prosecutor.

Under the circumstances,

That's right.

749
00:57:43.722 --> 00:57:48.518
I'll wrap this up with
the chief prosecutor,


750

Yeah, okay.

- You came by?
- Sure did.

00:58:11.375 --> 00:58:14.168
A ton of things are all tangled up.

Well, things happen.

Why is Jung doing this?

766
00:58:36.608 --> 00:58:39.860
I think we had some misunderstanding.

767
00:58:39.861 --> 00:58:43.322
That can happen when men work together.

768
00:58:43.323 --> 00:58:46.534
Should I go mess him now?

769

don't we go out for dinner?

Good day, sir.

870
01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:16.919
I saw the paper,

871
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.923
I can't believe someone's been talking!

872
01:07:44.197 --> 01:07:45.197
You sure about this?

873
01:07:45.907 --> 01:07:49.285
Yes, why'd blow the lid on this?

874
01:07:51.329 --> 01:07:54.372
I know you're not someone
who'd blow the whistle.


875
01:07:54.373 --> 01:07:58.085
But since all the pieces fit,

876
01:07:58.086 --> 01:07:59.337
I have to check.

877
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:01.589
Sure.

878
01:08:01.881 --> 01:08:03.466

I tripped while on a hike...

880
01:08:10.682 --> 01:08:15.435
Be careful, one misstep

Yes.

882
01:08:16.771 --> 01:08:18.773

01:08:20.108 --> 01:08:22.525
We're no pushovers.

884
01:08:22.526 --> 01:08:23.526
Of course not.

887
01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:34.329
Goddamn prick!

888
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.624
Ahn, go easy.

889
01:08:40.544 --> 01:08:42.088
What brings you here?

890
01:08:43.882 --> 01:08:47.010
I see it now...

891
01:08:49.428 --> 01:08:51.555
Now I see the whole picture.

892
01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:14.995
I'm thinking of doing
a follow-up in 2 days.


893
01:09:14.996 --> 01:09:17.915
The new city case, right?

894
01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:20.376
Lee will do the follow-up.

895
01:09:21.544 --> 01:09:24.047
Why don't you take a vacation?

896
01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:27.425
What are you doing?

897
01:09:29.928 --> 01:09:32.847
Who is it this time?

898
01:09:33.389 --> 01:09:36.516
Whose money did you take?

899
01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:37.893
It's not like that.

900
01:09:37.894 --> 01:09:39.103
Then why?

901
01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.106
Just do what I say!

902
01:09:43.107 --> 01:09:45.026
Tell me why!

903
01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:46.945
We're told to stop.

904
01:09:47.696 --> 01:09:48.779
By whom?

905
01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.199
The one paying our salaries.

906
01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:02.043
Even if we got a bad reputation,

907
01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:04.963
this is crossing the line.

908
01:10:05.964 --> 01:10:09.216
If you sell yourself to everyone,

909
01:10:09.217 --> 01:10:13.387
how can we call ourselves reporters?

910
01:10:22.939 --> 01:10:24.315
I'm resigning.

911
01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:29.112
Man...

912
01:10:31.865 --> 01:10:35.159
I wanted to cook steaks,
so I built a cowshed.


913
01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:37.495
Then I brought a calve,

914
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:41.207
fed it and cleaned it too.

915
01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:46.378
But someone else lit the barbecue.

916
01:10:46.379 --> 01:10:48.339
So I came to see who it was,

917
01:10:49.298 --> 01:10:51.968
I didn't think you'd be here.

918
01:10:52.551 --> 01:10:54.511
I didn't intend to take what's yours.

919
01:10:54.512 --> 01:10:55.846
I know.

920
01:10:55.847 --> 01:10:59.225
Presidential election's coming
up, the pressure is on,


921
01:10:59.934 --> 01:11:02.270
your only way was to use money.

922
01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:06.023
But numbers are a separate matter.

923
01:11:06.024 --> 01:11:11.779
Take Busan's 2 km² out,

924
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:19.536
compensation site is 1 km²,
total compensation is $320M,


925
01:11:19.537 --> 01:11:22.580
market price went up
by 2, but we'll go 50-50,


926
01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:26.168
take out the initial capital,
which comes to $160M,


927
01:11:26.169 --> 01:11:29.964
plus bribes from the developers!

928
01:11:31.507 --> 01:11:34.010
Shouldn't I have some stake in it too?

929
01:11:36.054 --> 01:11:39.432
You're sounding more like a capitalist.

930
01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:42.977
How will you play politics like that?

931
01:11:44.478 --> 01:11:45.688
Remember what you said?

932
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:52.361
To be in politics, either have
a lifeline, or shit ton of money.


933
01:11:53.196 --> 01:11:56.950
I'm holding your lifeline.

934
01:11:57.992 --> 01:12:01.954
I also told you to ask for a favor
to someone stronger than you.


935
01:12:01.955 --> 01:12:06.542
"To see who is stronger,
see what they're holding."


936
01:12:09.838 --> 01:12:12.672
All right, let's hear it,
what are you holding?


937
01:12:12.673 --> 01:12:14.717
Obviously, the new city plan,

938
01:12:15.676 --> 01:12:20.763
Democratic Party's suspicious
illegal slush fund sources.


939
01:12:20.764 --> 01:12:23.683
When I sell these to the
opposition before the election,


940
01:12:23.684 --> 01:12:25.936
they'll really have a field day, no?

941
01:12:25.937 --> 01:12:28.063
If you don't want
it to come to that,

942
01:12:28.064 --> 01:12:33.319
it'd be wiser to bargain with
me at a dirt cheap price.


943
01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:50.294
How much stake are you thinking of?

944
01:12:53.089 --> 01:12:54.089
10%.

945
01:12:54.924 --> 01:12:57.927
As an independent fighter,
I need at least that much.


946
01:13:07.811 --> 01:13:09.063
Oh my!

947
01:13:12.984 --> 01:13:14.818
You got ambition, good.

948
01:13:17.655 --> 01:13:18.864
Ambition?

949
01:13:21.159 --> 01:13:26.705
You took that away from me years ago,

950
01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:30.626
this isn't ambition,

951
01:13:32.628 --> 01:13:34.713
it's revenge.

952
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:49.979
You're still quite naïve,
going after revenge and all.


953
01:13:54.858 --> 01:13:56.319
You listen now.

954
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:00.698
Revenge is one of two things:

955
01:14:01.907 --> 01:14:05.578
either beat him to death,

956
01:14:07.288 --> 01:14:09.415
or be on the same side.

957
01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:13.127
If you don't go all the way,

958
01:14:16.255 --> 01:14:18.341
I'll end up killing you.

959
01:14:31.854 --> 01:14:33.481
I won't wait long.

960
01:14:35.316 --> 01:14:37.401
I'll prep a large safe.

961
01:14:42.991 --> 01:14:44.242
Hae-woong.

962
01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:48.079
Clench your fist tightly.

963
01:14:49.913 --> 01:14:53.001
Or your lifeline will slip through.

964
01:14:55.419 --> 01:14:57.546
Don't you worry about me.

965
01:15:09.933 --> 01:15:10.933
Song!

966
01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:13.521
Hey, Song!

967
01:15:14.355 --> 01:15:16.149
Make your own damn coffee!

968
01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:17.899
I'm sick of you all...

969
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.861
No, answer this call,
someone's asking for you!


970
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:26.575
This is Song Dana.

971
01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:29.953
A tip?

972
01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:36.044
Stop the car.

973
01:15:53.519 --> 01:15:55.020
So? What did he say?

974
01:15:58.316 --> 01:16:03.696
We went to a foxhole to catch
a fox, but found a tiger.


975
01:16:06.907 --> 01:16:09.493
There's only one answer then.

976
01:16:10.828 --> 01:16:12.955
We have to catch the tiger.

977
01:16:15.833 --> 01:16:17.210
Pil-do.

978
01:16:18.586 --> 01:16:21.964
When a politician's bank gets fat,

979
01:16:23.674 --> 01:16:25.843
it means there's risk to his life.

980
01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:30.764
What is a risk-free life?

981
01:16:31.515 --> 01:16:34.477
One ankle sprain could lead to death.

982
01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:41.359
Right? You're correct.

983
01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:44.362
There's no turning back now,

984
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.448
all right! Let's do this!

985
01:16:48.241 --> 01:16:53.454
Now you feel like a politician.

986
01:17:02.463 --> 01:17:03.463
<i>Incarceration Record</i>

987
01:17:03.464 --> 01:17:06.967
He's one of top Busan
loan sharking gangsters.


988
01:17:07.468 --> 01:17:11.554
During the anti-gang initiative,
all the big names got swooped up,


989
01:17:11.555 --> 01:17:14.933
and he took over the castle.

990
01:17:15.768 --> 01:17:16.894
What's wrong?

991
01:17:17.728 --> 01:17:18.937
It's nothing.

992
01:17:20.273 --> 01:17:22.733
He's working with Hae-woong recently.

993
01:17:23.942 --> 01:17:26.944
They've been working
together since the election.


994
01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:29.448
Funds from Jung Han-mo,
muscles from Kim Pil-do.


995
01:17:30.908 --> 01:17:31.908
Jung Han-mo?

996
01:17:32.243 --> 01:17:36.914
He worked as a developer
but demolition and scraps too.


997
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.499
He's practically a swindler.

998
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:43.879
After the election, he had a fit
about not getting his money back,


999
01:17:45.339 --> 01:17:46.340
it was a shit show.

1000
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:48.090
So?

1001
01:17:49.885 --> 01:17:51.886
- He's dead.
- How?


1002
01:17:51.887 --> 01:17:54.890
He drunk drove off a cliff.

1003
01:17:57.393 --> 01:18:00.103
So this bastard killed him.

1004
01:18:01.355 --> 01:18:02.898
Put together a script.

1005
01:18:05.651 --> 01:18:08.278
But it's...

1006
01:18:08.279 --> 01:18:10.239
Are you on Hae-woong's payroll?

1007
01:18:13.909 --> 01:18:15.536
Christ...

1008
01:18:18.622 --> 01:18:22.210
Start anew, a scenario
that benefits you too.


1009
01:18:23.252 --> 01:18:24.252
I will, sir.

1010
01:18:31.176 --> 01:18:33.429
Push through! Go!

1011
01:18:34.638 --> 01:18:35.638
What the hell?!

1012
01:18:40.185 --> 01:18:43.646
I don't know who you
are, but that's enough.


1013
01:18:43.647 --> 01:18:44.857
Mr. Kim Pil-do?

1014
01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:47.651
So hot in here.

1015
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.196
You need to come with us.

1016
01:18:51.947 --> 01:18:53.990
Where? It's a bad day for a trip.

1017
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:56.410
- You know Jung Han-mo?
- Jung Han-mo?


1018
01:18:59.663 --> 01:19:02.583
Mr. Jung? Yeah, I know him.

1019
01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:04.834
Is he doing well?

1020
01:19:04.835 --> 01:19:08.589
He's dead, and you're
the prime suspect.


1021
01:19:09.423 --> 01:19:10.883
May I make a call?

1022
01:19:11.509 --> 01:19:13.344
To Jeon Hae-woong?

1023
01:19:13.969 --> 01:19:15.929
He's indisposed at the moment.

1024
01:19:17.473 --> 01:19:22.603
How crazy would I be
to order a hit on him?


1025
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:30.068
Look, prosecutor, Jung
was my main supporter.


1026
01:19:30.611 --> 01:19:33.154
I'm asking because
there's enough plausibility.


1027
01:19:33.155 --> 01:19:35.115
Plausibility?! Really?!

1028
01:19:35.866 --> 01:19:39.201
Why'd you threaten a citizen
with just plausibility?


1029
01:19:39.202 --> 01:19:41.246
Do I look that easy?

1030
01:19:42.956 --> 01:19:45.458
And the investigation looks easy?

1031
01:19:45.459 --> 01:19:48.085
You're a murder suspect!

1032
01:19:48.086 --> 01:19:49.086
Me?

1033
01:19:51.214 --> 01:19:53.884
Didn't he die after getting hammered?

1034
01:19:54.968 --> 01:19:58.805
Alcohol was found in
his lung during autopsy.


1035
01:19:58.806 --> 01:20:00.308
Do you know what that means?

1036
01:20:01.266 --> 01:20:04.186
Alcohol was poured into him!

1037
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:08.690
He drank like that, he
poured alcohol into him.


1038
01:20:08.691 --> 01:20:11.108
I've had it with you, goddamn hooligan!

1039
01:20:11.109 --> 01:20:14.279
Fess up! Did Jeon order you?!

1040
01:20:15.989 --> 01:20:18.367
Listen now, Mr. Prosecutor.

1041
01:20:21.495 --> 01:20:27.709
Tables can turn at any
moment in one's life.


1042
01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:29.252
Think this carefully.

1043
01:20:30.463 --> 01:20:34.174
And I'm a politician.

1044
01:20:34.842 --> 01:20:37.344
If a gangster is dead, go
catch a rival gangster,


1045
01:20:37.345 --> 01:20:39.846
I really don't understand
why you're hassling me.


1046
01:20:39.847 --> 01:20:43.016
Even gangsters have
a reason when they kill.


1047
01:20:43.934 --> 01:20:46.227
It's money or a job.

1048
01:20:46.228 --> 01:20:48.481
Then you got an answer!

1049
01:20:49.022 --> 01:20:52.191
They fought over money,
and one side flexed too hard!


1050
01:20:52.192 --> 01:20:54.695
That's what gangsters do!

1051
01:20:56.364 --> 01:20:57.531
How dare you...

1052
01:20:59.492 --> 01:21:03.371
If you got nothing else, I'm gonna go.

1053
01:21:04.329 --> 01:21:06.457
I have a lunch appointment.

1054
01:21:24.683 --> 01:21:26.350
<i>How is it going?</i>

1055
01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:28.270
Is this also your work, sir?

1056
01:21:29.146 --> 01:21:33.316
If you want to live,
turn the car around.


1057
01:21:34.026 --> 01:21:40.240
Push comes to shove,
I won't go down alone.


1058
01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:42.785
No regrets, you hear?

1059
01:22:08.769 --> 01:22:11.772
We've met before.

1060
01:22:14.567 --> 01:22:17.319
What brings a man like you here?

1061
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.741
You must be tight with
the prosecutors too.


1062
01:22:23.784 --> 01:22:27.037
Very impressive.

1063
01:22:28.539 --> 01:22:30.999
We operate in the shadows though.

1064
01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:37.881
Loyalty is good.

1065
01:22:39.424 --> 01:22:40.593
Beautiful, even.

1066
01:22:42.595 --> 01:22:46.348
The important thing is,
for whom you serve.


1067
01:22:47.975 --> 01:22:50.143
Do you know what's moronic?

1068
01:22:53.021 --> 01:22:55.107
Loyalty among morons.

1069
01:23:27.598 --> 01:23:31.058
I brought quality stuff, so I
ordered expensive dishes.


1070
01:23:31.059 --> 01:23:33.311
It must be explosive then.

1071
01:23:34.688 --> 01:23:35.814
Let's hear it.

1072
01:23:50.954 --> 01:23:52.122
<i>A tip?</i>

1073
01:23:54.291 --> 01:23:56.371
<i>$160M Bribery Scandal Over
Busan New City Development</i>


1074
01:24:21.569 --> 01:24:26.615
Could you repeat what you
said in an answer form?


1075
01:24:27.365 --> 01:24:30.993
- What is your name?
- Park Sang-man.


1076
01:24:30.994 --> 01:24:32.245
Occupation?

1077
01:24:32.746 --> 01:24:36.416
Manager at Haeundae District
Election Commission.


1078
01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:43.298
What happened on the night of April 12?

1079
01:24:47.678 --> 01:24:50.973
<i>And I'm a politician.</i>

1080
01:24:51.682 --> 01:24:54.141
<i>If a gangster is dead, go

1081
01:24:54.142 --> 01:24:57.104
<i>I really don't understand
why you're hassling me.</i>


1082
01:24:58.521 --> 01:25:04.862
I leaked film negatives for ballots,
serial numbers and seals.


1083
01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:07.072
<i>Why?</i>

1084
01:25:08.115 --> 01:25:11.533
<i>Even gangsters have
a reason when they kill.</i>


1085
01:25:11.534 --> 01:25:14.578
<i>It's money or a job.</i>

1086
01:25:14.579 --> 01:25:18.666
<i>They fought over money, and

1087
01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:21.253
<i>That's what gangsters do!</i>

1088
01:25:23.463 --> 01:25:25.841
- I made a deal.
- A deal?


1089
01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:28.969
He said he'll get my
child a heart surgery.


1090
01:25:30.846 --> 01:25:32.097
Ms. Song...

1091
01:25:32.973 --> 01:25:35.142
<i>My wife is not reachable...</i>

1092
01:25:42.232 --> 01:25:46.737
Do you feel it now? To
whom you must be loyal?


1093
01:25:48.656 --> 01:25:51.742
I heard you've made a mint.

1094
01:25:52.743 --> 01:25:55.746
You need to go
big to make big bucks.

1095
01:25:57.748 --> 01:25:59.875
Think very carefully.

1096
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.893
Had he called early, I'd
have prepped something.


1097
01:26:18.894 --> 01:26:20.519
I'm so sorry for this.

1098
01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.522
Eat slowly, there's plenty more.

1099
01:26:23.523 --> 01:26:25.442
Okay, thank you.

1100
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:38.537
Ms. Song, you're so pretty.

1101
01:26:38.538 --> 01:26:39.790
Thank you.

1102
01:26:40.665 --> 01:26:43.043
Take good care of him.

1103
01:26:44.336 --> 01:26:49.341
- He's a bit lacking... but he is no harm...
- Head on in.


1104
01:26:50.425 --> 01:26:52.845
This is not bad, but...

1105
01:26:55.472 --> 01:26:57.640
we need a stinger.

1106
01:26:59.517 --> 01:27:01.560
Then let's do our own thing.

1107
01:27:01.561 --> 01:27:03.771
I'll be fine on my own.

1108
01:27:03.772 --> 01:27:04.772
So...

1109
01:27:07.317 --> 01:27:08.485
how about a show?

1110
01:27:11.696 --> 01:27:13.406
Let's have a press conference.

1111
01:27:14.449 --> 01:27:17.953
Gather all the reporters
in town, line the cameras!


1112
01:27:18.912 --> 01:27:20.998
Go big in one fell swoop!

1113
01:27:24.334 --> 01:27:26.837
Let's reset this country.

1114
01:27:32.384 --> 01:27:33.593
Hello?

1115
01:27:35.846 --> 01:27:39.141
What's up at this hour?

1116
01:27:40.058 --> 01:27:43.979
I didn't do much, no
need to give me gifts.


1117
01:27:44.562 --> 01:27:46.356
I found it!

1118

What are you getting at?

1120
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:03.665
<i>You recognized it immediately?</i>

1121
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:08.086
<i>Do you see me?</i>

1122
01:28:09.462 --> 01:28:13.049
You'll go after the prosecutors now?

1123
01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:14.676
<i>My father said once,</i>

1124
01:28:15.427 --> 01:28:18.137
to work a cow, put
a ring on its nose.

1125
01:28:18.138 --> 01:28:19.931
<i>You think this straight.</i>

1126
01:28:19.932 --> 01:28:22.684
If you fool around, how'll
you handle the backlash?


1127
01:28:24.352 --> 01:28:26.604
Does it look like I'm fooling around?!

1128

01:29:16.446 --> 01:29:20.199
Of course you're innocent.

1131
01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.034
I greased the officials,

1132
01:29:22.035 --> 01:29:25.371
to be frank, they got nothing.

1133
01:29:25.372 --> 01:29:26.748
They were bluffing.

1134
01:29:27.499 --> 01:29:32.837
You just have to hold out.

1135
01:29:33.463 --> 01:29:34.463
Got it?

1136
01:29:35.298 --> 01:29:36.466
Here, here.

1137
01:29:40.262 --> 01:29:42.014
You did good.

1138
01:29:56.653 --> 01:29:59.031
- Hae-woong.
- Yeah?


1139
01:30:02.659 --> 01:30:04.411
Let's stop this.

1140
01:30:05.954 --> 01:30:06.954
Stop what?

1141
01:30:08.248 --> 01:30:12.544
Whatever it is, what you're doing now.

1142

Bud, we're almost there,
we got the winning hand.

Pil-do, you stick to muscles.

1144

I'll do all the thinking, got it?

On a fishing boat on
the night of April 12th,

I handed ballot film negatives,

serial numbers and seals to
Kwon Soon-tae personally.


1148

One moment.

1149
01:30:59.049 --> 01:31:02.260
We should emphasize
that you were threatened.

Ancestral rite? Good timing.

1156

Old man, let's bet again.

1157
01:31:34.751 --> 01:31:38.588
I got an ace up my sleeve.

1158
01:31:45.262 --> 01:31:46.846
Wait outside.

1159
01:31:56.064 --> 01:31:57.224
Where's the chief prosecutor?

1160
01:31:57.815 --> 01:32:00.817
At his office, where else?

1161
01:32:00.818 --> 01:32:02.654
Probably drafting a warrant.

He has resurrected from the dead.

1166
01:32:14.249 --> 01:32:18.420
Politics isn't like a gangster
movie, this is way too dramatic.


1167
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:22.549
So much trouble to
kill a pawn like me?

1168
01:32:27.554 --> 01:32:31.683
It wasn't just for you,
so don't feel too bad.


1169
01:32:32.184 --> 01:32:36.396
No elections ever have
the proper results, right?


1170
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:39.816
So what will you do?

1171
01:32:47.907 --> 01:32:49.326
I feel so bad that

1172
01:32:52.204 --> 01:32:54.621
I might expose everything.

1173
01:32:54.622 --> 01:32:55.665
If you do?

1174
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.003
Will it change anything?

1175
01:33:01.671 --> 01:33:04.382
Slush funds for a rigged
election isn't exactly news.

Ruling and opposition parties,
prosecutors, the president,

they are all in on it.

1178
01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.056

I'll give you your 10%.

1182

You seriously underestimate me.

1183
01:33:31.659 --> 01:33:34.121
That was before my ace.

1184
01:33:35.205 --> 01:33:39.291
I'll make absolutely sure
you get elected, wait, wait.


1185
01:33:39.292 --> 01:33:42.002
There's a by-election in October.

1186
01:33:42.003 --> 01:33:44.463
Our deal is one thing,

1187
01:33:44.464 --> 01:33:48.259
isn't a mutual apology in order

1188

for our past mistakes?

1189

- The election.

Elections come around
in time, am I right?


1192
01:34:08.696 --> 01:34:13.160
But the dead won't.

1193

His wife is unreachable.

1194
01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.918
If you must apologize,
do it to Mr. Park first.


1195
01:34:24.796 --> 01:34:26.631
Go on, apologize.

1196
01:34:41.438 --> 01:34:43.190
Mr. Park.

1197
01:34:44.732 --> 01:34:46.443
I am truly sorry.

1198
01:35:22.019 --> 01:35:23.355

What's going on? Please...

1213
01:37:57.216 --> 01:37:58.843
What's going on...

1214
01:38:00.052 --> 01:38:03.889
During the planning phase of
Haeundae new city business,


1215
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:07.100
I was assaulted and threatened
by violent gangs,


1216
01:38:07.101 --> 01:38:11.312
and had to hand over confidential
copy of the proposal,


1217
01:38:11.313 --> 01:38:15.484
which included proposed
sites, compensation plans,


1218
01:38:15.485 --> 01:38:19.530
and Yellow Dragon Dev's
Jung Han-mo died


1219
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:23.785
after a struggle with a rival gang.

1220
01:38:26.829 --> 01:38:28.247
You died once,

1221
01:38:28.915 --> 01:38:30.625
second time will be easier.

1222
01:38:33.377 --> 01:38:34.462
Take care.

1223
01:38:54.190 --> 01:38:56.150
- Let me use the phone.
- Sure.


1224

Don't kill me!

1227
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:45.783
Answer please!

1228
01:40:12.434 --> 01:40:13.894
I'd like to make a reservation.

1229
01:40:13.895 --> 01:40:15.563
Which day?

1230
01:40:17.148 --> 01:40:18.148
Is there a room?

1231

Any last words? Make it good.

1233

reveal your assaulter?


1241

Yes.

1242
01:42:23.607 --> 01:42:25.234
It's Kim Pil-do.

1243
01:42:45.129 --> 01:42:46.798
Mr. Park.

1244

I am truly sorry.

Now, your turn.

1246

Apologize to Jung Han-mo in hell.

1247

Kim Pil-do spilled his guts.

1248

called a draw, isn't it?

1250
01:43:37.639 --> 01:43:38.850
Look here.

1251
01:43:55.366 --> 01:43:56.743
This is...

1252
01:43:59.161 --> 01:44:02.414
called win-win, am I right?

1253
01:44:03.791 --> 01:44:05.042
Win-win?

01:48:56.083 --> 01:48:57.334
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.


1292
01:49:01.004 --> 01:49:03.214
Be at ease, we're all family now.

1293
01:49:03.215 --> 01:49:04.716
Of course.

1294
01:49:06.093 --> 01:49:09.054
By the way, the trouble starts now.

1295
01:49:09.055 --> 01:49:13.683
We've been bluffing all over,
what can we do about it?


1296
01:49:13.684 --> 01:49:16.477
Must we do that too?

1297
01:49:16.478 --> 01:49:19.564
They gotta clean up their own mess.

1298
01:49:19.565 --> 01:49:21.732
You worry too much.

1299
01:49:21.733 --> 01:49:24.110
Who even remembers those words?

1300
01:49:24.111 --> 01:49:28.282
People are too busy to remember
campaign promises.
