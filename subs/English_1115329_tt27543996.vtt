<i>and what a victory for
Daniel Wheldon.</i>


161
00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:01.252
Dan was unbeaten for two years.

162
00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:04.422
[announcer] <i>I think it's gonna
be Wheldon that takes it.</i>


163
00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:06.715
[reporter] He's quite good,
isn't he?


164
00:09:06.716 --> 00:09:09.218
I've had lots of seconds
against him.


165
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.596
[young Dan] Just got to not
make silly moves,


166
00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:14.264
get as many points as possible,

167
00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:16.057
and go for it in the final.

[announcer] <i>Out in front,
it's number one,</i>

<i>Daniel Wheldon!</i>

175
00:09:35.953 --> 00:09:37.871
I always thought,
out of the drivers, that


176
00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:39.372
I was one of the strongest.

177
00:09:39.373 --> 00:09:41.417
And that is
what I'm out to prove.


178
00:09:42.084 --> 00:09:44.044
Formula 1 is expensive.

179
00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:45.170
I couldn't afford it.

180
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:48.715
So Dan wanted to get to IndyCar.

181
00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:50.133
It was the hardest day
of my life


182
00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:51.885
seeing him going out of Emberton

183
00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:54.137
with his helmets and his bags

184
00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:55.555
to race in America.

185
00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:57.475
Look, I've done my job.

186
00:09:58.768 --> 00:10:00.477
My job was to get him there.

187
00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:01.687
[music fades]

00:10:15.618 --> 00:10:18.829
[Susie] Listen, I know
it's a long day,


189
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.125
but we have to get ready
for tomorrow.


190
00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:25.420
I'm gonna go check on Sebastian.

Get your suit and stuff
and put it in the laundry room.


194
00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:57.368
All right. And your bag.
Empty your bag.

You're gonna get to drive.


226
00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:22.536
How excited are you
with this opportunity?


227
00:12:22.537 --> 00:12:24.412
I'm dying to get
in the car right now.

I just can't wait to go racing.
It's gonna be fantastic.

Dan drove the hell
out of that car.


230
00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:36.509
He had instinct,
he had quick hands.

for a rookie that
we wanna bring in.

We are at the Dan Wheldon
monument here in St. Petersburg.

As you all know,
Andretti Autosports

that development series.

00:13:00.408 --> 00:13:02.993
Michael, who are
your new drivers in this team?


241
00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:04.953
Well, we got a couple
young hot shoes


242
00:13:04.954 --> 00:13:07.456
that we've been watching since
they've been this tall,

00:13:07.457 --> 00:13:09.167
and now they're about this tall.

00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:12.378
You might know their last name
and their father.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.264
I mean, uh, I've been
watching a lot

of what they've been
doing in go-karts.

Everywhere they go
they're running up front.

We're here to get them through
the road to Indy,


252
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:32.773
and hopefully
to IndyCars one day,


253
00:13:32.774 --> 00:13:33.774

I'm not the kinda guy

Good luck today.

was today for you guys?


264
00:13:56.255 --> 00:13:59.049
It's very exciting especially
because my dad


265
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.635
was on Andretti
and it was his first team.


266
00:14:01.636 --> 00:14:05.515

- Yeah. [chuckles]

that kind of...

thought is there, for sure,

277
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.579
um, but it's not something
that is... is...

00:15:08.244 --> 00:15:10.579
you feel scared, alone,

288
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.373
and then you have these
two little faces,


289

you know, that are, like,
looking at you.

And...

291
00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:20.006
Yeah.

292
00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:23.925
You just... you know
that you have to


293

keep going and figure it out.

294
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.268
Racing has taken from me

295
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:35.937
the most important thing
in my entire life.


296
00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:37.857
But it's also given me so much.

297
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.110
I'm sure a lot of people that
don't understand the sport,


298
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:43.613
it's like, "Wait a second.

299

in a motor racing accident,

and now you're letting
your kids drive.


301
00:15:51.204 --> 00:15:53.664
How do you reconcile that?"

302
00:15:54.123 --> 00:15:55.832
But that's my job,

303
00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:58.210

I'm helping them to achieve
their dreams,


306
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.093
just like Dan did.

Signing on with Michael Andretti

308
00:16:08.888 --> 00:16:10.013
is an amazing opportunity,

309
00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:11.348
but I always tell them,

310
00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:13.183
"You still have to
earn your stripes.

[Michael] <i>From a team
standpoint,</i>


317
00:16:29.158 --> 00:16:31.576
it's very important not
to only look at the talent,


318
00:16:31.577 --> 00:16:33.871
but you also gotta look
at the personalities.


319
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:38.042
And so we were very careful
when we picked our guys.

he says, "We hired
another driver."

So who did you guys hire?"

The cockiest person
I've ever met.

00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:27.258
Pretty quickly,
Dan made his presence felt.


342
00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:30.093
This is gonna be
a little interesting, guys.


343
00:17:30.094 --> 00:17:31.595
So, uh, you gotta bear with me.

344
00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:34.264
Bear with me, I'm gonna
make some introductions.


345
00:17:34.265 --> 00:17:36.350
He's talking to the boss
right now, so...


346
00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:38.435
- This is the famous...
- I'm beautiful.


347
00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:39.770
The famous piece.

348
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.980
And look at that.
I dropped the microphone.


349
00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:43.523
This is the boss,

350
00:17:43.524 --> 00:17:45.233
so obviously we've
got to be nice to him.


351
00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:47.278
- Mr. Andretti.
- Better be nice.


352
00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:50.572
Michael said, "I need somebody
to come here right now

a bit of a mentor-type role."


354
00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:55.745
[Dan] This is the new teammate,
Mr. Bryan Herta.


355
00:17:56.078 --> 00:17:59.916
Famous in California for his
skate shoes and baggy pants.


356
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.752
[Bryan] And he told me my belt
was too smart for my shoes.


357
00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:05.712
[chuckles] And I thought,

358
00:18:05.713 --> 00:18:08.298
"That's an odd thing to say
to somebody you just met."


359
00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:10.175
He was a kid that wanted
to learn.


360
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.510
Dan asked many questions.

361
00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:13.804
"How does this work?
What does that do?"


362
00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.139
"Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?"


363
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.641
And answered few.

364
00:18:17.642 --> 00:18:19.643
[chuckles] Yeah, typical Dan.

365
00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:21.853
I felt bad for Susie. [laughs]

366
00:18:21.854 --> 00:18:24.689
[Michael] Susie worked for
Dan's sponsor, Jim Beam,


367
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.150
and she ended up
taking care of Dan.


368
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:28.485
[chuckles]

369
00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:30.654
[Dario] There was Dan
doing what Dan did


370
00:18:30.655 --> 00:18:31.947
and there was Susie making sure

371
00:18:31.948 --> 00:18:33.907
he didn't do anything
he shouldn't do,


372

or trying to.

373
00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:36.993
Let's interview Susie.

374
00:18:36.994 --> 00:18:38.663
Put the mic on Susie.

375
00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:40.664
- Ask me anything.
- Speak to the camera.


376
00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:42.834
What's Dan Wheldon like
to work with?


377
00:18:44.335 --> 00:18:45.627
We could have
a one-on-one later,


378
00:18:45.628 --> 00:18:46.671
and I'll really tell you.

379
00:18:47.255 --> 00:18:50.173
I didn't know what I was doing.
If I'm honest.


380
00:18:50.174 --> 00:18:51.842
[gentle music playing]

381
00:18:51.843 --> 00:18:54.302
I ended up getting this job
in marketing.


382
00:18:54.303 --> 00:18:57.265
They gave me this...
Jim Beam account.


383
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.766
And I was coming into the
sport really not knowing


384
00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:01.643
much about the IndyCar
side of things,


385
00:19:01.644 --> 00:19:04.230
but, you know,
Dan was a rookie, too.


386
00:19:04.647 --> 00:19:06.606
We were both navigating
through those waters


387
00:19:06.607 --> 00:19:08.442
a little bit at the same time.

388
00:19:08.443 --> 00:19:10.026
I've gotta buy my own
dinner tonight,


389
00:19:10.027 --> 00:19:11.987
which is a bit
disappointing, but...


390
00:19:11.988 --> 00:19:15.532
I'm working on Susie Behm
to take us out.


391
00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:16.950
[Susie] Because I worked
with him,


392
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:19.536
you just pick up on the way
that somebody is


393
00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:20.704
and what they expect.

394
00:19:20.705 --> 00:19:23.415
Everything had to be
in its place.


395
00:19:23.416 --> 00:19:25.041
Dan was borderline OCD.

396
00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:27.420
I have the hangers
all going the same way.


397
00:19:27.962 --> 00:19:30.590
The pants are all kinda
hanging without creases.


398
00:19:30.965 --> 00:19:33.759
I even have the shoes
in their original boxes.


399
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.762
He had a certain method
for everything.


400
00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:40.682
He'd always have a pair
of new boots for race day,


401
00:19:40.683 --> 00:19:42.350
and I would always have to
de-lace them


402
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:44.603
and make sure that they were
exactly the same length


403
00:19:44.604 --> 00:19:46.605
of shoelace at the very top,

404
00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:48.316
and then re-lace them.

405
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.901
[Dario] With a race,
there's so many things


406
00:19:50.902 --> 00:19:52.152
that aren't in your control,

407
00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:53.987
you try and control
as much as you can.


408

[engines revving]

409
00:19:56.908 --> 00:19:59.493
[Tony] We have to do a track map
to tell how the car behaves.


410
00:19:59.494 --> 00:20:01.620
Me and Dario, we put
a couple notes here.


411
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:04.665
A couple arrows, some little
chicken scratch things.


412
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.083
[Susie] I was trying to
find the notes.


413
00:20:07.084 --> 00:20:10.088
Like... Like more
engineering notes.


414
00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.758
[Bryan] His track maps
were just...


415
00:20:15.426 --> 00:20:16.636
filled with words.

416
00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:19.764
Gosh. Like, this is
the kind of stuff he'd write.


417

[dramatic music playing]

418
00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:23.683
You're making me look bad.

419
00:20:23.684 --> 00:20:26.019
[Susie] "The throttle,
not the throttle pedal itself.


420
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.021
Does not have
a progressive feel to it.


421
00:20:28.022 --> 00:20:29.606
It's more like an on/off switch.

422
00:20:29.607 --> 00:20:31.858
If I have my foot
on the throttle 15%,


423
00:20:31.859 --> 00:20:33.944
there's not a 15% response
from the engine,


424
00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:35.529
there's only 5%.

425
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.947
If I have 65 throttle input,

426
00:20:36.948 --> 00:20:39.367
there is a 95 response
from the engine."


427
00:20:39.742 --> 00:20:41.076
Dan had a great rookie year.

A lot of potential.

I was racing with Sam Hornish

[Dario] I was upset
after the race.


453
00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:39.384
And rather than go to see
the bosses or any of that stuff,


454
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:41.636
Tony, Bryan, myself and Dan

455
00:21:41.637 --> 00:21:43.430
went and sat down
in a hotel room

and had a little discussion.

457
00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:46.266
I remember forcefully
telling him,


458
00:21:46.267 --> 00:21:48.810
"This is how we're gonna go
racing on this team


459
00:21:48.811 --> 00:21:50.353
and here's why,

00:21:50.354 --> 00:21:52.689

that we are to you."

463
00:21:55.443 --> 00:21:56.902
That actually caught him
by surprise.


464
00:21:56.903 --> 00:21:59.654
You know when you go,
"Wow, I did not expect that."

"Man I thought
we were closer than that."

He never gave us any indication
he was gonna leave,


864
00:39:07.225 --> 00:39:10.352
and then he basically told us
right before he announced it,


865
00:39:10.353 --> 00:39:13.481
and that one hurt a little bit,
for sure.

My contract is up.

1085
00:49:38.231 --> 00:49:40.024
I've been on Andretti forever.

1086
00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:44.195
Chip calls me, and he offers
me Dan's spot.


1087
00:49:45.196 --> 00:49:46.823
I'm very divided.

1088
00:49:47.406 --> 00:49:50.784
What am I gonna tell Dan?
But then you go, "Well,


1089
00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:53.663
he didn't tell me
when he left Andretti."

[Tony] We go to Kentucky

1092
00:49:58.668 --> 00:50:00.961
and we're racing
really hard together,


1093
00:50:00.962 --> 00:50:04.673
and he did something that
we do to other people,


1094
00:50:04.674 --> 00:50:06.716
but we never did to
each other, ever.

I'll tell you that.</i>

[Tony] After the race,

1100
00:50:17.645 --> 00:50:19.563
I go, "What was that?"

1101
00:50:19.564 --> 00:50:22.608
And he just told me, "Go f..."

1102
00:50:23.568 --> 00:50:24.944
and slammed the door on me.

1103
00:50:27.488 --> 00:50:29.198
We didn't speak for two years.

1104
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:32.909
I decided at the last minute
to stay with Andretti.


1105
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:36.914
Chip had to go back to his
fallback which was re-sign Dan.


1106
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.958
[Chip] When it came
down to it, we said,


1107
00:50:39.959 --> 00:50:42.502
"Dan, we'd like to have you.
We wanna offer this seat."


1108
00:50:42.503 --> 00:50:44.045
- He said...
- "Oh, hey, Chip.


1109
00:50:44.046 --> 00:50:46.883
You got the wrong number.
Are you trying to reach Tony?


1110
00:50:47.425 --> 00:50:48.592
I'm the second choice now?

1111
00:50:48.593 --> 00:50:50.218
Then I've already moved on.

1112
00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:51.845
I'm going to find somebody else.

1113

He was a risk-taker,
and sometimes it paid off


1116
00:50:59.228 --> 00:51:00.855
and sometimes it didn't.

1117
00:51:01.773 --> 00:51:04.274
I'm the opposite.
I'm always second-guessing


1118
00:51:04.275 --> 00:51:05.859
and like, "Oh, my God,
is this right?


1119
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.236
How is this gonna be
two years from now, ten years?"


1120
00:51:08.237 --> 00:51:11.073
I think that's one of the things
I fell in love with.

[Chip] When Dan left the team,

1122
00:51:13.659 --> 00:51:16.036
we offered the drive
to Dario Franchitti.


1123
00:51:16.037 --> 00:51:17.830
And I took over the 10 car.

1124
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:22.794
I've made worse decisions.

00:57:17.982 --> 00:57:22.153
and your exit is slow
compared with him, okay?


1235
00:57:22.612 --> 00:57:24.739
He's rolling more speed.

1236
00:57:25.114 --> 00:57:26.699
Okay. I can fix that.

1237
00:57:27.658 --> 00:57:29.993
- [Leo] <i>You're better here.</i>
- [Sebastian] <i>In that turn?</i>


1238
00:57:29.994 --> 00:57:31.912
[Leo] <i>Mm-hmm.
You have to fix a little,</i>


1239
00:57:31.913 --> 00:57:33.206
<i>not that much.</i>

1240

"Dear Mom, I have probably
blown any chance I had


1241
00:57:43.257 --> 00:57:46.886
at racing because my attitude
is very bad and disrespectful.


1242
00:57:47.845 --> 00:57:49.054
I miss my dad.

1243
00:57:49.055 --> 00:57:51.014
Just watching all the other dads

1244
00:57:51.015 --> 00:57:54.184
walking their kids to the grid
and it hurts badly.


1245
00:57:54.185 --> 00:57:57.104
I would love it if I can change
the day with my actions,


1246
00:57:57.105 --> 00:57:58.855
if that's okay with you.

1247
00:57:58.856 --> 00:58:00.316
Love you."

1248
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.570
It's okay to feel those things.

1249
00:58:05.113 --> 00:58:06.321
[Sebastian] I want to race.

1250
00:58:06.322 --> 00:58:08.031
I want to be better than my dad.

1251
00:58:08.032 --> 00:58:10.368
[Susie] I'm not talking
about that, sweetheart.


1252
00:58:10.993 --> 00:58:12.619
I was just talking
about the things


1253
00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.870
that you were saying
about Daddy.


1254
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:15.789
You never said that
to me before.


1255
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.332
You don't think
I think about it and miss him


1256
00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:18.750
being there with you and Oliver?

1257
00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:20.336
He should be there.

[Sebastian] Oh... Five-five.

1262
00:58:47.071 --> 00:58:50.157
Tony was there was Dan was
trying to figure this whole...


1263
00:58:50.158 --> 00:58:51.700
Trying to figure himself out.

1264
00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:52.742
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:58:52.743 --> 00:58:54.995
So, you've seen it all. [laughs]

1266
00:58:54.996 --> 00:58:56.746
- [Tony] You were there too.
- [Susie] I know.


1267
00:58:56.747 --> 00:58:58.332
But it... you know.

1268
00:58:58.833 --> 00:59:00.168
[Oliver] Oh.

1269
00:59:01.586 --> 00:59:04.505
[Tony] Do you guys know why
it's good to play ping pong?


1270
00:59:04.922 --> 00:59:06.423
The quicker you are reflex,

1271
00:59:06.424 --> 00:59:08.258
the quicker you're gonna be
as a race car driver,


1272
00:59:08.259 --> 00:59:10.386
so let's see how good you are.
Ready?


1273
00:59:11.095 --> 00:59:14.056
[peaceful music playing]

1274
00:59:19.604 --> 00:59:20.854
[sighs]

1275
00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:22.814
Do you think you lost
the race already?


1276
00:59:22.815 --> 00:59:24.609
- Yeah.
- [Tony] No.


1277
00:59:24.984 --> 00:59:26.527
Next!

1278
00:59:29.572 --> 00:59:32.115
- Look at your mom.
- [Susie] I know. I'm actually...


1279
00:59:32.116 --> 00:59:34.659
- For somebody that didn't play.
- [Susie laughs]


1280
00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.287
I'm good at something too.

1281
00:59:37.163 --> 00:59:39.539
All their talents don't come
only from Dan.


1282
00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.707
Come on.

1283
00:59:40.708 --> 00:59:42.626
- Yeah. Come on.
- [laughs]

Come on.

- Is that all you got?


1286
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.799
I'm only ten!

1287
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.300
You... you shouldn't be talking.

1288
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:51.719
I'm only 46.

1289
00:59:52.595 --> 00:59:53.721
Oh, both hands!

1290
00:59:54.263 --> 00:59:55.305
Okay.

1291
00:59:55.306 --> 00:59:56.973
Come on,
the two of you together.


1292
00:59:56.974 --> 00:59:58.309
Let's go.

1293
00:59:58.976 --> 01:00:00.520
Oh, you were close.

1294
01:00:00.812 --> 01:00:02.479
Look, look, look.

1295
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.482
[laughter]

1296
01:00:05.483 --> 01:00:07.151
[boys laughing]

1297
01:00:10.196 --> 01:00:12.280
[Michael] Now, you guys
understand what pressure is?


1298
01:00:12.281 --> 01:00:13.990
- [Sebastian] Yes.
- [Oliver] Tire pressures?


1299
01:00:13.991 --> 01:00:16.201
Not tire pressures. [laughs]

1300
01:00:16.202 --> 01:00:18.162
Yeah, they know tire pressures.

1301
01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:20.122
- Tire pressures.
- Woo-hoo!


1302
01:00:20.123 --> 01:00:21.498
[Susie] A different
kind of pressure.


1303
01:00:21.499 --> 01:00:23.250
[Michael] A different
kind of pressure, like...


1304
01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:25.836
- Like on the...
- It's more pressure like


1305
01:00:25.837 --> 01:00:28.088
you guys being Dan's son,

1306
01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:30.340
a lot of people are
gonna be watching you


1307
01:00:30.341 --> 01:00:32.342
and eyes are gonna be on you.

1308
01:00:32.343 --> 01:00:33.593
I'm sure you guys are gonna feel

1309
01:00:33.594 --> 01:00:35.387
a little different
than other drivers,


1310
01:00:35.388 --> 01:00:38.098
'cause I know I did
when I was driving growing up.


1311
01:00:38.099 --> 01:00:41.393
A lot of people expected you
to win, which is unfair,


1312
01:00:41.394 --> 01:00:43.562
because not everybody
can win every race.


1313
01:00:43.563 --> 01:00:46.148
So, you guys gotta know that
when you go out there and do it,


1314
01:00:46.149 --> 01:00:48.358
don't worry about what
everybody else thinks.


1315
01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:50.444
'Cause if you start worrying
about what they think,


1316
01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:53.030
then it gets your head
all messed up.


1317
01:00:53.698 --> 01:00:56.199
Do you guys feel like people
expect a lot more out of you?


1318
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.325
- I don't.
- Yeah.


1319
01:00:57.326 --> 01:00:58.952
[Michael] You don't?
That's good.


1320
01:00:58.953 --> 01:01:01.538
Just a little. 
It's not even...

1321
01:01:01.539 --> 01:01:04.208
[Michael] There's nothing
wrong with feeling it.

[announcer 1] <i>Dan Wheldon

at Panther.


1328
01:01:30.234 --> 01:01:32.570
Dan was a bit on
desperate times, for sure.

[birds calling]

1330

[Dario] Dan's out of a ride.
I'm like, what?


1331
01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:48.752
You've got one of
the most talented drivers


1332
01:01:48.753 --> 01:01:49.962
of a generation,

1333
01:01:50.296 --> 01:01:51.631
and he's out of a ride.

1334
01:01:52.757 --> 01:01:54.257
How is this possible

1335
01:01:54.258 --> 01:01:56.636
that Dan Wheldon
is not gonna drive?


1336
01:01:58.221 --> 01:01:59.763
[Scott] It's a pretty
fickle business,


1337
01:01:59.764 --> 01:02:03.768
so it didn't surprise me that
options were changing for Dan.


1338
01:02:04.435 --> 01:02:08.272
[Bryan] Later in my career,
I started a part-time team.


1339
01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:11.441
So, I reached out and said,
"Hey, I don't know


1340
01:02:11.442 --> 01:02:13.235
if this is gonna be of interest,

1341
01:02:13.236 --> 01:02:15.445
but we're gonna run
a car at the Indy 500.


1342
01:02:15.446 --> 01:02:17.614
Would you consider
driving for us?"


1343
01:02:17.615 --> 01:02:20.283
We'd only entered
one IndyCar race ever.


1344
01:02:20.284 --> 01:02:22.285
We were the slowest car
in the field.


1345
01:02:22.286 --> 01:02:24.121
We crashed in the race.

[announcer]
<i>Right in the middle of a turn,</i>

<i>goes off and ends up
hitting the wall.</i>


1348
01:02:29.168 --> 01:02:31.086
[sighs] I remember thinking,

1349
01:02:31.087 --> 01:02:33.089
"Is it the right thing
for Dan?"


1350
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.882
Dan, you know if you show up
in Indianapolis,


1351
01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:37.468
you've got a chance at winning.

1352
01:02:38.136 --> 01:02:40.971
Could Bryan and his team
perform to that level?


1353
01:02:40.972 --> 01:02:43.224
He felt a loyalty with Bryan,

1354
01:02:45.184 --> 01:02:46.977
and quite honestly,

1355
01:02:46.978 --> 01:02:49.313
what did he have
to lose at that point?


1356
01:02:50.022 --> 01:02:52.733
Dan was like,
"Yeah, let's do it."


1357
01:02:53.484 --> 01:02:56.821
[Bryan] <i>We'd formed a technical
alliance with Sam Schmidt.</i>


1358
01:02:58.156 --> 01:02:59.448
<i>We rented a car from them.</i>

1359
01:02:59.449 --> 01:03:01.283
<i>It wasn't their best car.</i>

1360
01:03:01.284 --> 01:03:02.492
<i>It wasn't their second-best car.</i>

1361
01:03:02.493 --> 01:03:04.411
<i>It wasn't their third-best car.</i>

1362
01:03:04.412 --> 01:03:07.747
<i>I know for sure it was one of
the oldest in the field.</i>


1363
01:03:07.748 --> 01:03:09.542
Let's go see Daddy's car.

1364
01:03:11.002 --> 01:03:12.919
But you have to be
really gentle.


1365
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.254
[Oliver] Wait, can I?

1366
01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:16.340
- Am I allowed?
- Mm-hmm.


1367
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:20.427
[somber music playing]

1368
01:03:20.428 --> 01:03:23.013
[Sam] One of the reasons
we partnered with Bryan


1369
01:03:23.014 --> 01:03:24.890
is because we knew
Dan would be driving,


1370
01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:27.684
and you either love this place
or you're intimidated by it.


1371
01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:30.021
And I think he's
one of the guys that loved it.


1372
01:03:30.813 --> 01:03:32.732
[Susie] Can you even reach
the pedals?


1373
01:03:33.357 --> 01:03:35.902
I can touch the pedals
when I'm right here.


1374
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.778
[Bryan] Because of
the importance


1375
01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:40.906
of the Indianapolis 500,
we spend more time preparing


1376
01:03:40.907 --> 01:03:42.365
there than any other race.

1377
01:03:42.366 --> 01:03:44.409
We're literally there
for almost a month.


1378
01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.120
Every day, even if there was
nothing going on on the track,


1379
01:03:47.121 --> 01:03:49.664
he'd come in the garage,
he'd sit in the car.


1380
01:03:49.665 --> 01:03:52.417
Have the guys just adjust
the mirror a little bit.


1381
01:03:52.418 --> 01:03:54.377
Trim this a little bit here.

1382
01:03:54.378 --> 01:03:56.296
"Can we find a little bit
of speed here?


1383
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:58.131
Can we tighten up
the body fit here?


1384
01:03:58.132 --> 01:03:59.466
Can we adjust this mirror?"

1385
01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:01.218
His attention to detail,

1386
01:04:01.219 --> 01:04:03.095
it was incredibly motivating.

1387
01:04:03.096 --> 01:04:04.847
We didn't wanna let him down.

1388
01:04:06.599 --> 01:04:09.059
Dan Wheldon, the father of two,

1389
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.268
ready to compete
at Indianapolis.


1390
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:11.478
Thanks for joining us.

1391
01:04:11.479 --> 01:04:13.230
I'm sure my sons are gonna win

1392
01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:14.356
many more races than me.

1393
01:04:14.357 --> 01:04:16.400
So, hopefully it's Indianapolis.

1394
01:04:18.236 --> 01:04:20.737
[Bryan] I'm walking all over.
Didn't know where you guys were.


1395
01:04:20.738 --> 01:04:22.907
- [Susie] Trying to find you.
- Good to see you.


1396
01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:27.410
Here's what you might not know.

1397
01:04:27.411 --> 01:04:30.080
We were a small team,
but your dad would show up


1398
01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:31.623
every day at the track.

1399
01:04:31.624 --> 01:04:33.917
He'd tell us we're gonna win.
He really believed.


1400
01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:35.460
And he believed it so much,

1401
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.837
that he made us start
to believe it,


1402
01:04:36.838 --> 01:04:39.089
'cause we didn't really
believe it at first.


1403
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:40.465
And he made us believe it.

1404
01:04:40.466 --> 01:04:42.927
And then he made us not
wanna let him down.


1405
01:04:43.428 --> 01:04:45.053
[man] Dan was always
my favorite driver


1406
01:04:45.054 --> 01:04:46.179
when I was your guys' age.

1407
01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.306
Dan was a huge
inspiration for me


1408
01:04:48.307 --> 01:04:49.599
in getting to IndyCars.

1409
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.310
Same with me.
I was able to take the 26


1410
01:04:52.311 --> 01:04:54.396
right when he went to Ganassi.
I went into that...


1411
01:04:54.397 --> 01:04:57.566
Into his seat.
So, big shoes to fill for sure.


1412
01:04:57.567 --> 01:05:01.361
I think you have to be born
with some sort of, um, skill


1413
01:05:01.362 --> 01:05:02.779
that was passed down.

1414
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.616
And then it's what you
do with it, how you mold it.


1415
01:05:06.409 --> 01:05:08.535
[Tony] We were happy
Dan was in the race,


1416
01:05:08.536 --> 01:05:10.412
but he was the underdog.

1417
01:05:10.413 --> 01:05:13.666
I mean, such a long shot.

1418
01:05:14.584 --> 01:05:16.209
[Dario] Pretty early
in the month,


1419
01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.544
we're all...
"What's going on?


1420
01:05:17.545 --> 01:05:19.129
How are they looking here?"

1421
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.924
[announcer 1] <i>And the next out,
Bryan Herta Racing.</i>


1422
01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.760
[announcer 2 <i>] He's trying to
wring everything he can out,</i>


1423
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:26.887
<i>and that's what Dan Wheldon
is so good at.</i>


1424
01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:30.056
I just don't think we ever
didn't get better.


1425
01:05:30.057 --> 01:05:34.227
[announcer 2] <i>Pick up some pace,
about 228.7 for Dan Wheldon.</i>


1426
01:05:34.228 --> 01:05:36.021
It was like, okay.

1427
01:05:36.022 --> 01:05:37.564
Okay, this isn't too bad.

1428
01:05:37.565 --> 01:05:39.983
[solemn music playing]

1429
01:05:39.984 --> 01:05:41.526
[Dan] We've had a group that

1430
01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:44.154
has really brought the fun
back to racing for me.


1431
01:05:44.155 --> 01:05:46.282
[reporters laughing]

1432
01:05:46.866 --> 01:05:48.950
From my perspective,
I wanna come together


1433
01:05:48.951 --> 01:05:50.703
and just create a headline.

1434
01:05:54.582 --> 01:05:56.374
[Bryan] In the garage,

1435
01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.835
we had a little whiteboard
with a to-do list on it.


1436
01:05:58.836 --> 01:06:01.171
There's little boxes
and you'd check the box


1437
01:06:01.172 --> 01:06:02.924
after things were done.

1438
01:06:03.257 --> 01:06:04.633
The day before the race,

1439
01:06:04.634 --> 01:06:07.512
Dan looked at it and wrote
on the bottom,


1440
01:06:08.012 --> 01:06:09.680
"Win the Indy 500."

1441
01:06:10.014 --> 01:06:11.182
And, uh...

1442
01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:15.352
[voice breaks]
Now I'm gonna get emotional.


1443
01:06:15.353 --> 01:06:17.647
[soft music playing]

1444
01:06:18.773 --> 01:06:21.818
Oh, I kept it together
for so long. [clears throat]


1445
01:06:24.362 --> 01:06:25.737
[Tony] Before the 500,

1446
01:06:25.738 --> 01:06:29.617
the four of us went to
a very expensive steak house.


1447
01:06:30.827 --> 01:06:32.369
[Dario] There was a lot
of piss taking,


1448
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.955
but then there was
a softer side.


1449
01:06:34.247 --> 01:06:36.957
It was more sort of, "Hey,
we've been through a lot."


1450
01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:39.292
And Dan was definitely more
thoughtful about


1451
01:06:39.293 --> 01:06:40.711
everything that happened.

1452
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:47.050
It was a great moment where Dan
acknowledged what we...


1453
01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:48.468
That we had helped him.

1454
01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:51.848
Something he had never really
done in the past.


1455
01:06:52.974 --> 01:06:54.350
He said, "Hey, um...

1456
01:06:55.143 --> 01:06:57.352
thank you for everything
you guys have done for me.


1457
01:06:57.353 --> 01:06:58.938
I mean, I've learned a lot.

1458
01:06:59.397 --> 01:07:01.441
I'm a better person," and, uh...

1459
01:07:03.234 --> 01:07:05.236
that was our last dinner.

1460
01:07:07.738 --> 01:07:08.739
Sorry.

1461
01:07:09.657 --> 01:07:11.241
I promised I was not
gonna do that.


1462
01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:12.659
[exhales] Anyway...

1463
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.997
I have a picture of us.
We took a picture.


1464
01:07:16.456 --> 01:07:17.747
I still have it.

1465
01:07:17.748 --> 01:07:19.374
We all do.
It's a bad picture


1466
01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.209
because we asked
somebody to take it.


1467
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.044
It was on the inside
of a restaurant


1468
01:07:23.045 --> 01:07:24.881
with my phone with no flash.

1469
01:07:25.423 --> 01:07:27.717
[soft music continues]

1470
01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.679
[Dario] It was like, we've
been through a lot together


1471
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.807
and it's cool that we're here
and we're still pals.


1472
01:07:35.808 --> 01:07:37.101
[sniffles]

1473
01:07:38.895 --> 01:07:40.480
[laughter]

1474
01:07:41.731 --> 01:07:44.483
- Oof! [groans]
- It's gonna be crazy today.


1475
01:07:44.484 --> 01:07:46.276
There's gonna be a lot
of people around


1476
01:07:46.277 --> 01:07:48.528
- and people that are gonna...
- 'Cause it's the Indy 500.


1477
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:50.615
Yeah. But do you know why else?

1478
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.242
It's been ten years
since Dad died?


1479
01:07:54.327 --> 01:07:56.536
You were just little.
You were a baby.


1480
01:07:56.537 --> 01:08:00.124

at the hotel with the boys.</i>


1482
01:08:07.924 --> 01:08:10.634
I was just telling Oliver
that it's gonna be, like,


1483
01:08:10.635 --> 01:08:12.094
really busy this weekend,

1484
01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:14.429
and there's probably gonna
be cameras and stuff,


1485
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:17.057
- 'cause it's a special year.
- Yeah.

[Susie] <i>We got a police
escort to the track.</i>


1487

- I'm good. How are you?
- You are?


1488
01:08:23.397 --> 01:08:25.023
Yeah, not bad.
Hanging in there.


1489
01:08:25.024 --> 01:08:27.068
- Good luck today.
- Good to see you.

having a role at the track.</i>

that same passion

1538
01:10:35.113 --> 01:10:37.531
[Bryan] They were able to go
a lap or two longer

on every tank of fuel
that we could.


1540
01:10:39.617 --> 01:10:42.077
And so I knew
that if it turned into


1541
01:10:42.078 --> 01:10:43.955
a fuel economy race at the end,

1542
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.541
we weren't gonna beat them
at that game.

1551

[Bryan] And I've got
a decision to make.


1552
01:11:10.064 --> 01:11:12.149
Either we pit with the leaders

1553
01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:15.485
and try and bring home
a solid top-five finish,


1554
01:11:15.486 --> 01:11:17.738
or we risk it all...

1555
01:11:18.531 --> 01:11:19.991
and go for a win.

1556
01:11:21.492 --> 01:11:23.035

1559

1567
01:11:51.397 --> 01:11:54.566
[Scott] I had what we thought
was a winning situation,


1568
01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:59.113
and we calculated wrong on fuel,
so then had to slow down.

1588
01:12:50.289 --> 01:12:53.333

this would be incredible
if we could finish fourth.

01:17:49.922 --> 01:17:51.840
Okay, okay! [gasps]

1685
01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:53.675
- What have I done?
- [boys laughing]


1686
01:17:53.676 --> 01:17:55.135
You raised us wrong!

to watch here today.</i>

[crowd cheering]

1700
01:18:59.575 --> 01:19:01.786
- [Leo] It's about time.
- [Susie] Yeah.


1701
01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.540
[Sam] Winning the Indy 500
was a launching pad


1702
01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:09.167
for Dan to re-energize
his career.


1703
01:19:09.168 --> 01:19:11.253
He was like, "Okay, now
I've got myself another


1704
01:19:11.254 --> 01:19:14.381
five to ten years in the sport
because of this victory."


1705
01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:15.924
But in the world of motorsports,

1706
01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:19.386
if you want to win one race,
that's the Indianapolis 500.


1707
01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.805
This kid coming out here
has won it twice.


1708
01:19:21.806 --> 01:19:24.016
[audience cheering]

1709
01:19:24.684 --> 01:19:26.768
When will you go back to racing
full-time now?


1710
01:19:26.769 --> 01:19:29.312
It's nice that you come
out of retirement once a year


1711
01:19:29.313 --> 01:19:31.148
to win the Indianapolis 500,

1712
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:33.316
but when will you have
a regular series ride?


1713
01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:35.652
Well, we're working on that
with Bryan Herta.


1714
01:19:35.653 --> 01:19:38.739
And, you know, there has
been some interest.


1715
01:19:39.365 --> 01:19:40.824
[Susie] At the time,
Randy Bernard


1716
01:19:40.825 --> 01:19:42.617
was the president of IndyCar.

1717
01:19:42.618 --> 01:19:46.079
He had a professional
bull riding background.


1718
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.289
[crowd cheering]

1719
01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:49.124
[Sam] Randy came in
with a mission


1720
01:19:49.125 --> 01:19:52.002
to raise the image of IndyCar,

1721
01:19:52.003 --> 01:19:54.129
to put more butts in the seats,

1722
01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:56.006
put more eyeballs
on the screens,


1723
01:19:56.007 --> 01:19:57.466
and he's a promoter by nature.

1724
01:19:57.467 --> 01:19:58.925
We're reaching out to our fans

1725
01:19:58.926 --> 01:20:01.762
each and every way we can,
and that's why we did...


1726
01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.431
If you buy a ticket to any
IndyCar Series race,


1727
01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.016
you get a free ticket
to the world...


1728
01:20:06.017 --> 01:20:07.810
The IndyCar world championships.

1729
01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:10.938
[Sam] <i>He was moving
the season finale to Vegas.</i>


1730
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:14.357
<i>I think he was trying
anything creatively</i>


1731
01:20:14.358 --> 01:20:16.026
<i>to accomplish those goals.</i>

1732

[somber music playing]

1733
01:20:18.112 --> 01:20:21.698
[man] With some exciting news
about the world championship


1734
01:20:21.699 --> 01:20:22.991
in Las Vegas,

1735
01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:25.619
here is IndyCar CEO,
Randy Bernard.


1736
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.288
The IZOD IndyCar Series
and GoDaddy


1737
01:20:28.289 --> 01:20:29.748
are very proud to announce

1738
01:20:29.749 --> 01:20:31.625
that we will give
a $5 million challenge


1739
01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.794
to our Indy 500 winner,
Dan Wheldon.


1740
01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:36.213
Now, Dan, there's a couple
parameters for you.


1741
01:20:36.214 --> 01:20:37.423
[Dan chuckles]

1742
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.385
You have to start very last
of this 30-plus car field,


1743
01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:44.013
and you have to win the race.

1744
01:20:44.388 --> 01:20:45.722
[Bryan] Randy had this idea

1745
01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:49.142
that if Dan could come
from last to first,


1746
01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:51.686
he and a fan would
win $5 million,


1747
01:20:51.687 --> 01:20:53.814
and it sounded like
a great idea.


1748
01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:58.610
I feel at Vegas I'll be able to
compete for the win.


1749
01:20:58.611 --> 01:20:59.904
Absolutely.

1750
01:21:06.369 --> 01:21:08.496
[Leo] So, what's up, guys?

1751
01:21:10.998 --> 01:21:13.500
Next month we got a big race.

1752
01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:16.586
This is like an Indy 500
for go-karts.


1753
01:21:16.587 --> 01:21:17.964
Nice.

1754
01:21:18.339 --> 01:21:19.966
It says new venue.

1755
01:21:21.008 --> 01:21:24.011
I'm done with language,
and I'm done with history.


1756
01:21:24.929 --> 01:21:26.930
So you have math and science?

1757
01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:28.015
Wait.

1758
01:21:29.976 --> 01:21:30.977
[Susie] What?

1759
01:21:31.769 --> 01:21:34.605
The race is gonna be
at Las Vegas Speedway.


1760
01:21:35.314 --> 01:21:36.774
[Oliver gasps] Oh.

1761
01:21:38.025 --> 01:21:39.861
Oh. Oh, that's...

1762
01:21:40.361 --> 01:21:42.613
- [Susie] What are they saying?
- This?


1763
01:21:48.828 --> 01:21:50.997
You know what
that means then, right?


1764
01:21:53.958 --> 01:21:55.710
What a coincidence.

1765
01:21:56.836 --> 01:21:59.129
Is it a... is that what a
coincidence is?


1766
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.506
[Susie]
Well, it's unexpected, for sure.


1767
01:22:01.507 --> 01:22:03.843
Do I have to, though,
if I didn't want to?


1768
01:22:04.927 --> 01:22:06.095
I wanna go.

1769
01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.931
I think you should ask yourself
how you feel about it.


1770
01:22:09.932 --> 01:22:12.642
There's a lot attached to that,
and I just want to make sure


1771
01:22:12.643 --> 01:22:14.019
you guys are okay with that.

1772
01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.270
I'm okay with that.

1773
01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:17.398
Nothing to say, huh?

1774
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:20.443
[Sebastian] No, not really.

1775
01:22:21.152 --> 01:22:22.862
Just like any other race.

1776
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:26.532
[Susie] It's at the Speedway.

1777
01:22:29.827 --> 01:22:31.787
[Michael] I thought it was
the dumbest thing.


1778
01:22:31.788 --> 01:22:34.831
Randy Bernard had no
experience at all in IndyCars.


1779
01:22:34.832 --> 01:22:37.083
There were some gimmicks
with having a fast car


1780
01:22:37.084 --> 01:22:38.293
like Dan in the back,

1781
01:22:38.294 --> 01:22:40.378
but it was more
the racetrack itself.


1782
01:22:40.379 --> 01:22:41.922
It was very wide,

1783
01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:45.093
so it was gonna
lend itself to three, four,


1784
01:22:45.468 --> 01:22:48.386
maybe even five abreast
racing through the corners.


1785
01:22:48.387 --> 01:22:51.807
And when you have
that many lines of cars going,


1786
01:22:51.808 --> 01:22:53.517
eventually somebody's
gonna misjudge.


1787
01:22:53.518 --> 01:22:55.645
[uneasy music playing]

1788
01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.399
[Dario] I'd driven Vegas
in NASCAR,


1789
01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.693
and I just was telling them

1790
01:23:03.694 --> 01:23:06.029
it's not suitable
for an IndyCar.


1791
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:07.447
It's just not suitable.

1792
01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:08.907
There's no margin for error.

1793
01:23:08.908 --> 01:23:11.368
Somebody zigs and the other one
zags at the same time,


1794
01:23:11.369 --> 01:23:13.871
you know, you have
a massive accident.


1795
01:23:14.372 --> 01:23:16.749
- She's probably scared.
- Mm-hmm.


1796
01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:25.675
[Sebastian] Do you feel sad?

1797
01:23:26.342 --> 01:23:27.926
- Yeah.
- Mom, give me a hug.


1798
01:23:27.927 --> 01:23:30.263
- It's fine.
- No. You need a hug, Mom.


1799
01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:33.891
It's fine. I just want you guys
to be okay, you know?


1800
01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:39.980
Mom, I'm gonna be okay,
all right?


1801
01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:41.899
[Susie sniffles]

1802
01:23:44.277 --> 01:23:46.445
[Michael]
This is a publicity stunt,


1803
01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:48.488
putting our drivers
in a dangerous situation.


1804
01:23:48.489 --> 01:23:50.450
It's up to the Series
to protect us.


1805
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.705
You know? And unfortunately,
this is what we're gonna do.


1806
01:23:56.414 --> 01:23:58.708
It was very frustrating,

1807
01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:01.961
but I didn't make it public.

1808
01:24:05.757 --> 01:24:07.841
I don't care who wins.
I don't care what happens.


1809
01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:10.427
Let's just get outta here,
you know, in one piece.


1810
01:24:10.428 --> 01:24:13.014
[sniffles] Um...

1811
01:24:13.973 --> 01:24:16.768
- [Sebastian] Love you, Mom.
- Yeah. I love you too.

- That really is.</i>

<i>And he is already halfway
out of the car.</i>

as it made very hard contact.</i>

<i>The good news is James Jakes
is out of the car,</i>

[reporter] <i>In terms of practice,</i>

1825
01:25:02.146 --> 01:25:04.147
<i>it looked like cars
were going three wide.</i>


1826
01:25:04.148 --> 01:25:06.984
<i>Would you expect to see the
same thing in the race?</i>


1827
01:25:07.485 --> 01:25:09.569
[driver]
<i>No. I expect four wide.</i>


1828
01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:14.574
I expect it to be really
hairy and, uh, dangerous.


1829
01:25:14.575 --> 01:25:16.868
Yeah. This is gonna be
one that fans will love


1830
01:25:16.869 --> 01:25:19.580
and the drivers will be
thankful when it's over.


1831
01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:21.666
I didn't want him to do it.

1832
01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:24.001
I spoke to him
on the Saturday night.


1833
01:25:24.418 --> 01:25:28.630
I said to him, "The last thing
you want in a race like that


1834
01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:31.299
