Good morning.

I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

339
00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:20.258
Did I mention that
I was the Great Stone Dragon?


340

Go! The fate of the Fa family

341

After this Great Stone,
Humpty Dumpty mess,


355
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:58.546
I'd have to bring her home
with a medal to get back in the temple.

(GASPS) Wait a minute. That's it!

357
00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:04.135
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be
begging me to come back to work.


358
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.096
