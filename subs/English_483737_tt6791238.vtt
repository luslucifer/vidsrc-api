1
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
Take your marks

2
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.620
Alright guys, smile!

3
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.220
Cool

4
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.180
- Hey, great race today
- Thanks


5
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.740
Oh, I'm all sweaty

6
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.220
You killed it out there

7
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.860
I guess. It would have been
nice to win though...


8
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.460
You got a trophy

9
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.500
I got a medal
so did two other girls


10
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Well, I'm allowed
to be proud of you so...


11
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.060
- Are you proud of me too?
- Yes, I am


12
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.020
- What for?
- You're a special person


13
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.220
- Our special snowflake
- That's right, special snowflake


14
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.220
- Okay, what'll it be?
- Your turn


15
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.860
You're the big winner
you decide


16
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.820
You know you never choose. You
should get some say around here


17
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.660
Frozen?

18
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.020
You know, if that's how you
want to spend your turn, okay


19
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.220
You'll both be asleep
so soon, it won't matter


20
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.220
Oh yes yes
that, my young lady, is BS


21
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.820
Yes, yes

22
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.180
- No. Inappropriate
- Why?


23
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.820
It's just one of those society
things sis. Go change


24
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.060
Need any help?

25
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180
You don't have time to help
go get dressed


26
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.900
I don't know what
I would do without you


27
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.940
Good morning

28
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.860
- What is it?
- Nothing. No, it's just...


29
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.340
actually I wanted to talk
to you guys about...


30
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.420
- Oh no
- What is it?


31
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.220
Not what. Her

32
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.340
When? When's she coming?

33
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.620
- Next week
- I like her


34
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.460
You do?

35
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.340
Look, I just want you
to be happy


36
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.900
Me too

37
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.620
But can I just say one thing?

38
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.060
And it's about
what's right for you


39
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.580
so you just
you can't get mad at me


40
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.900
Well, I reserve the right to get mad
but you can say what you like


41
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.580
I would rather see you
with someone else


42
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.100
- Now I am a little mad
- Wait, why?


43
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.340
Well, listen. I mean, you get a vote
but it's after the third or fourth date


44
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.780
You don't get one a year
and a half later


45
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.380
I'm sorry I just...

46
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.900
Listen, I have played more
than fair with you


47
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.420
I haven't had her over
for sleepovers...


48
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.020
- TMI
- that you know of anyway


49
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.460
Way TMI

50
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.020
But I want her to be part
of our lives


51
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.860
Look, she could really
help you out around here


52
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.500
You could be like
a real seventeen year old


53
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.580
instead of a superhero
seventeen year old


54
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.860
Well, I like superhero seventeen

55
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.460
- Penny for your thoughts
- I'm nervous, you know?


56
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.140
What are you talking about?
The girls love you


57
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.580
- Really?
- Yes


58
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.820
Really? I just have
this feeling that...


59
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.860
Look, it's going to be a shake-up
but I think that's a good thing


60
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.900
I just don't want them to
associate me with disruption


61
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.060
No. Disruption, that's a good
thing. I mean, I need disruption


62
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.140
I know, but she's seventeen

63
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.940
I remember that age. I mean
she's going to have opinions


64
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.780
Listen. If you're having
second thoughts


65
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.220
you got to tell me because I put
the deposit on the moving truck...


66
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.460
No, no, no, no
I'm just thinking out loud


67
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.580
I think I'm going to make
a good friend for them


68
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.380
Wow, you are just...
you are such a toxic presence


69
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.700
I don't know how
this is going to work


70
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.180
What are you doing in there?
I won't tell anyone


71
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.020
What are you doing?

72
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.300
Talking...

73
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.700
Aren't you a little old
for imaginary friends?


74
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.500
I'm not tired anymore

75
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.900
What do you mean?
You're not scared, are you?


76
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.260
- No
- Then why can't you sleep?


77
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.740
Because...

78
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.620
Well count some sheep
or something alright?


79
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.660
It'll make my job easier

80
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.700
You can do this

81
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.580
I just want to thank you girls

82
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.060
for letting me into your home
and your hearts


83
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.580
I love your dad very much and I'm
looking forward to being your...


84
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.580
- Mom?
- Sister?


85
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.060
Maybe I could be a bit of both
a Momster


86
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.300
Now that has a ring to it

87
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.820
What are you doing?

88
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.700
Well, it's a new start, right?

89
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.620
She doesn't know
you were married?


90
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.500
What? No. Of course
she does just...


91
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.020
You know. We want to make
her feel welcomed


92
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.940
It's a new start for me
too, you know


93
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.100
I don't remember her

94
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.660
You know what?
She loved you very much


95
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.540
Do you want to put
that in your room?


96
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.180
Would that make you feel good?

97
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.820
Yes?

98
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.500
- Wow. It's up already?
- Oh. Yes, yes yes


99
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.140
- Are you sure that it fits?
- Yes. Yes, totally


100
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.020
- Yes
- Really?


101
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.580
Very much so. We can do
a Game of Thrones thing


102
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.980
Everybody's finally doing okay

103
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.980
I have been trying so hard

104
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.300
Don't worry
I'll keep it that way


105
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.700
Good stuff. You make it all
the way through this one?


106
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.900
Can't blame me for trying

107
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.140
Well you know Abby's
a little weird


108
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.660
So if you need any help
just let me know


109
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.060
There's no book for her

110
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.660
Thanks. That would be great

111
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.700
Oh, lighter

112
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.780
When did this start?

113
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.260
You have to be quiet
it's dinner time


114
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.140
Just the other day. Hey, Abs
what's the deal?


115
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.820
What's the deal?

116
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.540
Do you like her?

117
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.300
I think imaginary friends
can actually be healthy


118
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.820
- Yes, not as healthy as real ones
- Meh, let her explore


119
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.860
Did you just say "meh?"
like phonetically?


120
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.500
Oh. Is that not how you do it?

121
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.700
No, momster
it's internet speak only


122
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.180
Are you sure you're
only twenty-nine?


123
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.180
Just different interests I guess

124
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.740
Here we go, here we go
here we go. First two


125
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.300
- We got a medium, that's medium
- Okay


126
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.700
And medium rare

127
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.340
- Sesame seeds?
- Hemp seeds


128
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.940
I run track. They test, you know

129
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.180
Oh, don't worry. 
It wont show up

130
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.820
And if it did, weed never made
anyone run any faster


131
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.260
It's okay, Kellie

132
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.580
It's got Omega 3s

133
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.580
- Your dad loves it
- Yes, load me up


134
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.100
Yes, it adds an
extra crunch. I like it


135
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.660
And your brain likes it too

136
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.940
I would like to propose a toast

137
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.860
To welcoming Robin into our
home... and into our family


138
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.820
Thank you. Cheers

139
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.820
Ah!

140
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.860
- Jesus
- Are you okay?


141
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.660
I'm fine. Could you
grab me a paper towel?


142
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.180
Yes

143
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.260
- Yikes
- Thank you, I'm sorry


144
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.900
It's never been this exciting

145
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.660
You Okay?

146
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.260
Jesus Christ, you scared me

147
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.980
- You can't be here right now
- Wait, why not?


148
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.460
- My Dad's here
- He's never here on Tuesdays


149
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.860
Well, now she's here
and that's changed


150
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.340
That sucks

151
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.380
Didn't you see the cars?

152
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.540
We've talked about this

153
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.580
Come on. You know
we're more than friends


154
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.420
How's that?

155
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.700
I can tell by the way
you look at me


156
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.500
Look, they won't hear anything,
alright?


157
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.780
They're probably
going at it right now


158
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.420
And you want to do it
in sync with them?


159
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.460
Besides, I don't want
to think of him that way


160
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.860
Like, with another woman?

161
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.860
No. I mean, no one wants to think
about their dad doing anything


162
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.540
The seeds were stupid. I should
have asked before putting them on


163
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.180
That's just not true
she really liked them


164
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.300
But it's my first night here and I'm
messing with her food. Not good


165
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:57.340
"I know I'm not their Mom
Kellie's obviously fine, but Abby..."


166
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:07.340
"Abby's so young. There's
so much to protect her from"


167
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.460
- What happened?
- Someone slammed the window!


168
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.980
Abby!

169
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.140
What? Nobody slammed
the window. It just fell


170
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.500
I'll fix it later
it's too cold to have it open...


171
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.660
- What is he doing here?
- Getting me grounded?


172
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.620
I don't know
what I was thinking, I just...


173
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.580
Are you really going
to be grounded?


174
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.500
Please. He's wrapped
around my finger


175
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.460
Pretty soon he'll be wrapped
around your stepmom's


176
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.060
- She's not my stepmom!
- Not yet


177
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.100
- You have got to cut that out
- I'm not tired


178
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.420
I have heard that one before

179
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.300
You know I can lay here with you
if you want


180
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.820
Did Dad give you that?

181
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.100
Why doesn't daddy
talk about how she died?


182
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.460
Well, it's not very fun
to talk about


183
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.620
Mommy wasn't... it wasn't a good
time for daddy and mommy


184
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.820
But all you need to know
is that she loved you very much


185
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.980
Here, lay on your stomach

186
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.900
I'll show you how she used
to put me to sleep


187
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.300
Okay

188
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:35.540
"The itsy-bitsy spider went up
the water spout..."


189
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.580
"Down came the rain
and washed the spider out"


190
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.260
"Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain"


191
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.820
"And the itsy-bitsy spider
went up the spout again"


192
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.340
Again?

193
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.260
If you're anything like I was
this will take a while


194
00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.220
"The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the water spout..."


195
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.260
"Down came the rain
and washed the spider out"


196
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.980
"Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain"


197
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.820
"And the itsy-bitsy spider
went up the spout again"


198
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.820
"The itsy-bitsy spider went up
the water spout..."


199
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.260
"Down came the rain..."

200
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.020
Good morning!

201
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.460
Breakfast?

202
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.140
Um, you don't have to do that
I normally get it


203
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.300
- It's part of my routine
- Oh no, you have got school


204
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.940
I'm sure you have to cram or
whatever. It can be my routine


205
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.740
I kind of think that Abby's
used to my...


206
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.740
This is really good!

207
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.460
Thanks

208
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.780
I sold another one!

209
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.780
- Of those things?
- Be nice


210
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.180
So, did you get back to sleep after
your little adventure last night?


211
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.940
Yes. But the window
didn't shut like dad said it did?


212
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.340
- Oh no?
- It was cold so she shut it


213
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.940
Who shut it?

214
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.740
- Let's not really talk about this...
- I think it was Mom


215
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.860
Hey Abs, it wasn't Mom
she's not here anymore


216
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.780
I'm sure she's here in some way

217
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.660
Lexy, it is an honor
to be in your home


218
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.900
with your two beautiful daughters

219
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.220
Thank you

220
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.140
I'm sorry. Are you trying
to talk to a ghost?


221
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.460
Because ghosts are scary
even if it is Mom


222
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.220
- Which it isn't
- No. No. Of course not


223
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.140
I was thinking more along
the lines of a therapeutic...


224
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.500
Therapeutic is not talking to walls

225
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.700
So what makes you think
it's her? Why now?


226
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.780
She's been here all along
I just haven't been looking for her


227
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.100
I'm always late, but this...

228
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.660
I'm actually running
on time for once


229
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.900
Girls

230
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.900
Hey kiddo. I need you to
do me a little bit of a solid


231
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.820
What's that?

232
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.700
How would you feel about
integrating Robin a little more?


233
00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.900
She's been here 24 hours and I'm
already two for two on meals, Dad


234
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.660
I just want her to feel
welcome, you know?


235
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.780
And you could stand to do
a little bit of decorating


236
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.540
Did she make you say that?

237
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.940
No. I think it's a lot better
if it comes from you


238
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.460
Why are we selling our stuff?

239
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.260
Well, it's not all our stuff
it's her stuff too


240
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.740
We're just getting rid of the old
to make room for the new


241
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.580
Hey, fam

242
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.020
- Hi, Bernard
- Hi, Bernard


243
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.460
Grandpa!

244
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.460
How's my favorite grandkid?

245
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.940
Just kidding, it's a tie

246
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.660
- Hey James
- How are you?


247
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.580
- Hi! I'm Robin!
- Hi, I'm Bernard


248
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.980
How.. You... You have never met
before? Bernard is my father in law


249
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.340
- Nice to meet you
- You too


250
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.940
What are you doing with that?
We can't sell that!


251
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.940
Oh, I'm sorry
it didn't seem like your style


252
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.180
- This was my Mom's
- Oh my god, Kellie


253
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.380
I would never have put it in
this pile if I thought that...


254
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.700
- I don't remember this one
- Turquoise is a healing stone


255
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.540
Why don't you try it on?

256
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.500
You want it don't you?
Let's see how it looks


257
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.740
It looks beautiful on you
now she'll be with you always


258
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.820
Now let's take a look
at the rest of this garbage


259
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.220
Yes, there's quite
a bit here, Bernard


260
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.260
What does the law of conservation
of energy state?


261
00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.420
That energy can either
be created or destroyed


262
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.980
Very good. And what can energy
do under this law?


263
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.420
- It can change form
- That's correct


264
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.220
Though we still raise our hands
around here


265
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.340
I'm sorry, can I be excused?

266
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.220
Hi, there. You guys called
I'm here to pick up Abby


267
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.380
- She's not here
- What do you mean?


268
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.900
Her Mom picked her up

269
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.460
Okay, her mom is dead
you know that, right?


270
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.460
No, I am so sorry
so, not her Mom?


271
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.380
That pretty young lady
your father added her to the list


272
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.900
"Hi, you have reached James"

273
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.700
"I'm over forty, so feel free
to leave a message"


274
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.940
You know when I was in school
kids picked on me too


275
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.900
Big time. I was a little bit different
like you are


276
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.060
Us weird ones
we have to stick together


277
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.540
Come on
I have a surprise for you


278
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.340
- You do?
- Yes


279
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.940
I found that at the garage sale

280
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.820
I figured if Kellie gets
to keep the necklace...


281
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.500
I wanted to save something
for you too


282
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.780
You made this for me?

283
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.460
I think it's really important
that you feel a connection with her


284
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.020
And I want you to know that I am
here for you, not to take her place


285
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.580
I'm fitting in already?

286
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.460
Is that my mom's stuff?

287
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.540
I thought that since you
got to keep the...


288
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.620
Can you ask before doing
things like this please?


289
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.380
- I mean, she's already fixated
- Your dad and I talked about it


290
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, she can have it

291
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:15.540
It's just weird to seeing all
of her stuff again. I miss her


292
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.540
Of course you do

293
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.100
She was great. One of a kind

294
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.140
It was really sweet
what you did for Abby today


295
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.620
I just don't want her to think I'm
trying to replace the perfect mom


296
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.220
Part of you
has to wish she was still here


297
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.460
What? No

298
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.020
She was my choice back then
but you're my choice now


299
00:29:54.740 --> 00:30:01.460
You are not second fiddle
besides, she wasn't perfect


300
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.620
What do you mean?

301
00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.900
Well...

302
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.300
Something happened to her

303
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:28.660
I don't know what. It was like
the joy got sucked out of her


304
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.660
Like something
was tormenting her


305
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.260
I don't know what it was

306
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.580
But, maybe it was guilt

307
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:51.940
Or... maybe, maybe
it was somebody else


308
00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.340
When they found her body
she was not wearing her ring


309
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.020
Sweetie, I'm sorry

310
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.140
I just... I wonder about everything

311
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.260
"The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the water spout..."


312
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.580
"Down came the rain
and washed the spider out..."


313
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.740
"out came the sun
and dried up all the rain..."


314
00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.660
"and the itsy-bitsy spider
went up the spout again"


315
00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.300
"The itsy-bitsy..."

316
00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.700
Kellie, that tickles. 
I didn't know...

317
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.380
Kellie?

318
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.260
Mommy?

319
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.860
It's alright!

320
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.260
I was just, I was kind of hoping
that was you sneaking in


321
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.180
- I'm grounded, remember?
- Give me a break


322
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.020
Motion detector
Abby's still in her room, right?


323
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.460
He never sets it off

324
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.300
Yes, I told you, you have been
feeding him too much


325
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.540
- You don't believe in this...
- Of course not


326
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.940
Good. Here team cat

327
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.380
I'm going to go back to bed
you should too


328
00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.980
In a second

329
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.540
Why now?

330
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.460
So your house is haunted
by a ghost who


331
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.460
doesn't like your taste
in magazines?


332
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.820
- You think I'm crazy?
- I already think you're crazy. Hot


333
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.500
You really think this thing
wants to hurt you?


334
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.380
I mean, if it's something
you're really feeling...


335
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.020
I don't need sensitive Todd
I need practical Todd


336
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.140
Here

337
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.820
So you don't believe me either?

338
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.700
I thought you wanted
practical Todd


339
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.820
You know what?
I want patient Todd


340
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:17.780
Okay. Maybe you need a change
of scenery, you know?


341
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.140
I mean, at least next year we'll be
a thousand kilometers away


342
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.980
Actually I was thinking
of staying here


343
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.460
What do you mean?
We're going to Boulder


344
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.140
Not if I go
to college in the city

345
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.380
- Why would you stay?
- My family needs me


346
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.940
They'll be fine
they have got Robin now


347
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.980
- Got it. Patient Todd
- Yes


348
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.620
Abby

349
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.860
I told you. It was Mom

350
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.180
- No, Abby...
- She did Itsy-Bitsy


351
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.380
She asked about the necklace

352
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.540
- I need you to not talk to this thing
- But I like her


353
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:48.220
Abby, I'm your sister. I need you to
trust me. Okay? Do you trust me?


354
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.020
- Yes
- Whatever this thing is...


355
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.460
Stay away from it

356
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.340
What the hell is happening?

357
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.420
Robin, can you take Abby
to her room please?


358
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.780
- Wait, I'll help you...
- Please, Robin


359
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.780
Okay

360
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.100
Kellie, are you doing this
to sabotage us?


361
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.900
- Sabotage what?
- You know what


362
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.620
You think that I did this?

363
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:34.300
Maybe whatever was bothering
Mom is bothering Abby now too


364
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.900
What does that mean?

365
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.380
We both know Mom was acting
weird towards the end


366
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.540
That's not true
she was depressed


367
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.660
I think we're all just a little
on edge right now


368
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.900
and reading into the wrong things

369
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.780
Okay, so what about my room?

370
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.260
Maybe the shelf just
couldn't handle the weight


371
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.580
A testament to your hard work

372
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.140
I'm sorry, do your self help
books tell you to ignore


373
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.860
all danger to your family?

374
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.300
That's enough. Whatever
this is, we're still a family


375
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.780
- We can act like one
- Totally


376
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.900
Yes, we better go too
come on


377
00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.620
"And so what does Newtons
first law tell us?"


378
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.260
Ms. Caldwell?

379
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.220
Ms. Caldwell? Newtons first law

380
00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.380
I...

381
00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.340
An object ...
an object that is at rest...


382
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.900
and object that is at rest
will stay at rest


383
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.300
until an external force acts upon it

384
00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.260
And an object in motion
will not stop


385
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.100
until an external force acts upon it

386
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.420
Hey, you got a second?

387
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.940
Bernard. What's up?

388
00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.580
You have probably guessed
that I have steered clear


389
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.980
of meeting you
these past few years


390
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.660
Yes, I thought that might
be the case


391
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:37.660
Well, I came to apologize
it's just...


392
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.060
at the time I didn't know
what to think of it


393
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.580
Considering you knew her

394
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:51.220
James and I didn't get together
until three years after the funeral


395
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.300
It's a circle of friends
things happen


396
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.100
I was as surprised as anyone
that he asked me out


397
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.460
She's not an easy act to follow

398
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.820
Well, I'm here to explain
not accuse


399
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.780
I was just being a Dad
I'm fine with it now


400
00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.780
Life goes on

401
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.660
It's such an uphill battle as it is

402
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.180
- Kellie, huh?
- Yes


403
00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:32.340
Likes to be in charge doesn't she?
She's a handful, alright


404
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.860
With her you have
got to fight or roll over


405
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.180
Don't worry
I'm not going anywhere


406
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:45.100
Well, good luck with that

407
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.860
"So... did it show up again?"

408
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.820
Nothing that'll convince them
they're in danger


409
00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.700
"Well, what made it appear
last time?"


410
00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.020
The cat

411
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.860
Let me call you back

412
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.340
Here, kitty kitty

413
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.060
Here, kitty kitty

414
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.940
Why are you doing this?

415
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.300
Leave us alone!

416
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.780
Leave us alone!

417
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.100
You want this...

418
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.460
What are we going to tell Abby?

419
00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:00.100
He ran away? We sent him to
a farm where he could play?


420
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.940
I don't like it
why were you up so late?


421
00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.180
I don't even understand
what happened


422
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.140
I told you what happened

423
00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.140
Dad, listen.

424
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:23.820
Look, whatever Abby's
talking to, it's real. Dad, it did this


425
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.220
And it is not Mom
it's pretending to be her


426
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.060
I think. I don't know, I think
it wants something from Abby


427
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.340
To pull her away from us

428
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.820
I'm in. Look, I'm open to the
idea that there's something here


429
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:43.540
That there's a... Like...
I don't know


430
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.180
Like there might
be something here


431
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.220
that maybe it's your mother or...

432
00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.540
Does part of you wish it was her?

433
00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.980
Yes. I would have
some questions I guess, yes


434
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.900
People lose their rings all the time

435
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.340
I mean, Todds dad loses
his three times a day


436
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.780
It doesn't mean she was...

437
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.620
I won't talk about that
you don't have to fix this, okay?


438
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.180
We'll figure something out

439
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.380
Hopefully soon Robin
goes running for the hills


440
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.180
You're very protective
of your sister and me


441
00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.500
I think when your mother died

442
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.940
you took on too much responsibility
for a twelve-year old


443
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.100
- It's fine
- No, it's not. It's not fine


444
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.820
- But now I'm grabbing the wheel
- What do you mean?


445
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.620
I mean, you're wired to protect us
because I didn't do my job


446
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.780
And that's my fault. Because
I should have been stronger


447
00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.380
- So I'm being demoted
- No. You're being freed


448
00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.780
You don't have
to protect us anymore


449
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.980
Well what are you going to do?
About this?


450
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.020
I don't know. I'll figure it out

451
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.100
Here

452
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.900
Honey?

453
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.700
Honey what
are you doing?


454
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:29.180
Sweetie? Sweetie?

455
00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:42.500
- Everything okay, Ms. Caldwell?
- I'm sorry


456
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.820
- Hey, you alright?
- I got to go


457
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.860
- I heard you freaked out in class
- It's nothing


458
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.020
Well, in sociology they were talking
about totems...


459
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.580
And some cultures think
that physical objects


460
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.580
tie spirits to the real world

461
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.660
Yes, and?

462
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.580
The necklace. You said you had
some kind of effect on it. Right?


463
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.460
Like it was hurt?

464
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.540
I mean, that sounds exactly
like what they were talking about


465
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:22.260
Did they... did they say
if they could get rid of it?


466
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.220
No. This isn't Hogwarts, Kellie

467
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.820
My family needs to know
what this thing really is


468
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.460
Abby? Abby?
Wake up. Where is it?


469
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.900
Where is my necklace?
Where is my necklace, Abby?


470
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.540
- What?
- Where is my necklace, Abby?


471
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.340
Abby.

472
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.620
She wanted it

473
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.340
Where is it, Abby?
Where is the necklace?!


474
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:56.260
- I don't know
- Abby, where is it?


475
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.340
Where is my necklace?
Tell me right now!


476
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.660
- Where is my necklace?
- There!


477
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.860
You can't have her

478
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.660
Mommy?

479
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.140
No!

480
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.060
Dad, see? It's getting stronger

481
01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.940
Take Abby! I'm calling Bernard!

482
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.220
Should we pack our bags?

483
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:17.180
Hey, thanks for coming. Will you
take the girls over to your house?


484
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.460
Then I'm going to clear up here
and then we'll come back


485
01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.900
Clear up what?
What the hell is going on?


486
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.620
Jesus, Todd. Jesus. Oh my God!
Not a good time


487
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.140
You told me to come
when I knew something


488
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.580
Yes but why don't
you read the room man


489
01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.340
- Okay...
- I know how to use Google, Todd


490
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.740
Look, I took pictures
at the library. Okay


491
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.300
A Totem is something
that meant a lot to a person


492
01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.820
while they were alive...

493
01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.180
and now they're
bound to it in death


494
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.220
You said when you
interacted with it...


495
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.780
it affected this thing, right?

496
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.460
It definitely didn't like being burned
I could feel it through the necklace


497
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.740
Okay, so see here
if you destroy it...


498
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.540
it should sever the connection

499
01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.140
And I think we might be
able to get rid of this thing


500
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.700
What's that coming out of it?

501
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.660
I don't know. Who knows
what happens if this works?


502
01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:27.020
We need to get everyone out of
here. They need to be safe


503
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.540
So you guys are telling me
that a ghost is doing this?


504
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.220
Yes, something like that. Yes

505
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.260
Maybe it is my fault
I thought it would help Abby


506
01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.140
if she thought her Mom
was still close


507
01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.500
I should have never
encouraged her to talk to it


508
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.940
- For once I agree with you
- Kellie, that's enough!


509
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.300
You need to ask why this is
happening now. What's new here?


510
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.260
Come on Dad, we
need to do something


511
01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.860
Did you see that
thing try to take Abby?


512
01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.180
It's threatening my family
I'm not just going to sit back


513
01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.260
So what's it doing?
Is there a pattern to it?


514
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.860
It followed her here
maybe it wants to warn us


515
01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.580
Abby thinks that it's Lexy

516
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.020
No, not anymore
she's scared of it


517
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.980
Abby thinks that it's Lexy

518
01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.060
- And you saw this too?
- I don't know what it was


519
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.900
If my little girl is here
I want to know


520
01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.820
Bernard. Bernard! Wait!
Bernard...


521
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.460
- Bernard
- Bernard, what are you doing?


522
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.420
You guys can leave if you want

523
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.580
But if there's a chance
in hell that my daughter is here


524
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.020
I'm staying right here

525
01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.660
- Oh my God. Where's Abby?
- What? Jesus!


526
01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.740
- Abby!
- Abby! Abby!


527
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.780
See what you have done?

528
01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.220
I know you think it's all my fault...

529
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.700
You really think
that he's going to want


530
01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.620
anything to do with you after this?

531
01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.220
I mean you knew my Mom but you
really liked my Dad, didn't you?


532
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.100
What? You think I didn't
know that?


533
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.980
You don't think that we're
all starting to wonder


534
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.420
- what you did to take her place?
- What?


535
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.700
I don't know why
I was packing my bags


536
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.100
The one who should
be packing is you


537
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.780
Jesus Christ, will you guys
stop and find Abby!


538
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.980
Bernard, you should sit down
you really don't look good


539
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.740
You go look for Abby. I'll be fine

540
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.500
- Has Abby gone in here?
- What? No


541
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.940
- I need you to hide
- Why?


542
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.740
You do not want my dad
to find you in here right now


543
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.620
I'm not leaving, alright?
Let me help


544
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.940
Todd, we need to get rid
of this thing


545
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.140
What? What are you going to do?

546
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.740
I need to find Abby

547
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.980
Then I'll come get you
and we'll finish this, okay?


548
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.220
Where the hell is she?

549
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.020
Dad, we're not going
to find her, okay?


550
01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.780
God, I should have listened to you

551
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.300
If this thing took her

552
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.060
Maybe she's hiding
in the front yard


553
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.060
- Maybe... okay... I hope so
- Abby! Abby! Abby, honey!


554
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.820
Abby!

555
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.780
You doing okay?

556
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.780
Just a lot to take in

557
01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:04.740
You seem so sure it isn't her

558
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.700
Maybe you would
be jealous if it was


559
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.460
Trust me
I was never jealous of her


560
01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.220
This was her goodbye present

561
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.300
Let me help you with that

562
01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.460
No, no, give me...

563
01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:39.980
You always were a Daddy's girl

564
01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.860
Abby!

565
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.460
Abby!

566
01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.620
Abby!

567
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.220
Why would you keep
this from your dad?


568
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.660
- Relax
- Why would you have this?


569
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.700
It's okay, just relax

570
01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.660
You don't understand. She
and Dad weren't happy


571
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.780
I mean, he needed
somebody stronger


572
01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.060
What? Like you?

573
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.620
Robin. Robin, listen

574
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.580
Stay away from me

575
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.220
Don't worry, okay?
Dad's in the right hands


576
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.540
What was that?
What's going on?


577
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.980
Don't go out there!
That thing killed Robin!


578
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.180
Oh my God! Oh my God, okay...

579
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:37.780
We need to get out of here. Kellie
come on! Kellie? Kellie?


580
01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.060
Thank you for being
such a great friend


581
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.500
- What?
- You're so loyal. And so nice


582
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.940
You put up with all my... stuff

583
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.780
I really appreciate it

584
01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.700
I'm sorry, Todd
I really like you


585
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:52.580
But we could never be together
I belong to someone else


586
01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.380
You did a great job, okay? I just
didn't want the ghost to get you


587
01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.260
I didn't make a noise
even when Daddy was calling me


588
01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.700
Yes, don't beat yourself up

589
01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.740
All you need to remember is that
you're afraid of this thing, okay?


590
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.420
That's all dad needs to know

591
01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.940
- Okay? Come on
- Okay


592
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.260
- Thank God you're here!
- Daddy!


593
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.860
- Where were you?
- Dad! We have to leave!


594
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.700
That thing killed everyone! If we
don't leave right now we're...


595
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.140
What do you mean?

596
01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.700
What do you mean
it's got everyone?


597
01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.060
You're telling me that
thing... did this?


598
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.700
That's why Kellie told me
to hide in the crawl space


599
01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.540
- Abby!
- Wait... what?


600
01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:03.660
You told her to hide?
Why did you tell her to hide?


601
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.580
I didn't want it to find her

602
01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:14.740
Where's Robin?
Where is Bernard and Robin?


603
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.620
Why are you looking
at me like that?


604
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.020
Bernard? Robin? Robin?

605
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.500
I'm sorry, I just needed
a chance to explain


606
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.260
Where's Robin?
Where's Bernard?


607
01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.340
All of this was Mom

608
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.700
Oh my God!

609
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:14.620
She was trying to protect us...
when Robin moved in...


610
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.060
From you

611
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:22.660
Don't be ridiculous
I would never have hurt you


612
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.420
I have been protecting you

613
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.180
I have been protecting
you for years


614
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.420
I mean, I got rid of the drama
I got rid of the yelling


615
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.260
Think about how much happier
we were when she left


616
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.380
You... you killed her...
you killed her


617
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.020
Don't be sad, okay?

618
01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.860
This is totally fixable
we'll go back to the way it was


619
01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.220
Just us. You, and me
and Abby


620
01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:03.340
No Mom
no Robin... just us


621
01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.460
Weren't the past five years great?

622
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.580
Listen, why don't we just stop this
and we'll figure something out?


623
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.660
What is it that you
don't understand?


624
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.140
Robin!

625
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.820
We don't need her. We don't

626
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:35.300
Robin! Robin! Robin!

627
01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.300
I'm sorry. I really am
she was a fantastic woman


628
01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.940
Robin!

629
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.500
Robin!

630
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:13.060
She can't hear you. I tried
to stop it, I did


631
01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.900
but mom got her

632
01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:25.660
She's forgetting I'm the longest
relationship you have ever had


633
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.860
I'm your protector

634
01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.140
This is our family

635
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.820
I love you, Dad

636
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.060
Abby come here!

637
01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.580
Abby... seriously?

638
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.020
Nothing was haunting
your mother but you.


639
01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:10.940
That's not true. 
That's not true

640
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.140
Kellie, listen, honey...

641
01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.140
You need some help

642
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.900
But we're going to get you some

643
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.860
We're not going to be
together anymore?


644
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.140
You destroyed everything

645
01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:35.580
No!

646
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.980
Kellie, stop!

647
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.340
Abby come here
untie Daddy, Honey


648
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.500
By the way, your art sucks

649
01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.580
Kellie... your hand

650
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:37.300
Kellie, stop it!

651
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.500
Just some defensive wounds

652
01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.340
They'll see my side
they always do


653
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.900
Kellie, stop!

654
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.620
Dad... you replaced me

655
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.020
No

656
01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.180
You replaced me

657
01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:15.940
No honey...

658
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.140
I know, I know...
I still like the other one better


659
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:27.140
No, they're asleep. They're tired

660
01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:30.940
- Is she up?
- Let me check


661
01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.540
Who are you talking to?

662
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:42.940
You can tell me

663
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.060
Come on

664
01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:59.980
Meh, I'm just exploring

665
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.260
When are we going to stop
moving around?


666
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.180
As soon as we find
the right place to settle


667
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.020
We just need to... regroup a bit

668
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:27.820
But you know home is wherever
you want it to be, right?


669
01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.540
I'm going to go wake up
your Dad, okay?


670
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.220
"Listen, is everything alright?"

671
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.660
"We have got to keep
our eye on her"


672
01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:56.860
"The itsy-bitsy spider went up
the water spout..."


673
01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.300
"down came the rain
and washed the spider out..."


674
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.780
"out came the sun
and dried up all the rain..."


675
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:14.180
"then the itsy-bitsy spider
went up the spout again"


676
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.260
"Again"
