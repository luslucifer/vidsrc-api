00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:51.035
WHO?

319
00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:53.037
TELLY SAVALAS.
<i>KOJAK.</i>


320
00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:55.039
BULLSHIT.

321
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.041
IS THIS TOO
MUCH LIPSTICK?


322
00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:58.543
HE SAID NOT
TO USE TOO MUCH.


323
00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.043
DOES IT LOOK ALL RIGHT?

324
00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:01.546
IS THIS TOO MUCH
EYE SHADOW?


325
00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:03.549
DOES IT LOOK ALL RIGHT?

326
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.052
I THOUGHT
I HAD A VASE BUT...


327
00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:09.054
GET YOUR FEET OFF.

328
00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:10.555
YES, MA'AM.

329
00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:16.060
THAT WAS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE
DRESS YOU BOUGHT DOROTHY.


330
00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.563
OH, IT SEEMED
RIGHT FOR HER.


331
00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:21.065
SHE'S ALMOST READY.

332
00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.068
YOU SHOULD SEE HER.

333
00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.570
SMELL, MOM.

334
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.571
OOH.

335
00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.072
SMELL ME, GEORGE.

336
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:29.074
GET OUT
OF HERE.


337
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.575
COME ON.

338
00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:31.576
AW.

339
00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:34.579
SMELL IT, PAUL.
REAL DEEP.


340
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.080
MMM!

341
00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.582
THAT'S WHAT
SHE SMELLS LIKE.


342
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.084
IT'S CALLED
TOILET WATER.


343
00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:41.586
WAIT!
HOLD ON A SECOND.


344
00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.590
THE ORCHID
IS FOR DOROTHY,


345
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.092
AND THE GARDENIA'S
FOR YOU.


346
00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:48.593
THANK YOU.

347
00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.596
HE'S HERE!
WE BOTH GOT A PRESENT!


348
00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:53.097
THEY LIKE
THE WAY YOU SMELL.


349
00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:55.600
THAT EILEEN
IS A KNOCKOUT.


350
00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:03.608
ALL THE LADIES IN
THIS HOUSE ARE KNOCKOUTS.


351
00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.610
BULLSHIT AGAIN.

352
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.111
GEORGE.

353
00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.114
Eileen: ARE YOU READY?
HERE WE GO. Dorothy: YES.


354
00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:11.115
HERE SHE COMES,
EVERYBODY.


355
00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:13.117
SHE LOOKS LIKE
A MOVIE STAR!


356
00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:16.121
[PLAYS KAZOO]

357
00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.127
AHH!

358
00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:24.629
DOESN'T SHE
LOOK BEAUTIFUL?


359
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.630
TERRIFIC.

360
00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.131
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

361
00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:28.633
CAN WE TAKE
A PICTURE, MOM?


362
00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.133
I HAVE A CAMERA
IN THE CAR.


363
00:19:30.134 --> 00:19:31.134
I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.


364
00:19:31.135 --> 00:19:32.137
CAN I TAKE
THE PICTURE,


365
00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:33.138
PAUL?

366
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:39.143

367
00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:42.647

368
00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:47.152

369
00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.154

371
00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:56.160

372
00:19:56.161 --> 00:20:02.166

SEE YOU ANYMORE ?


373
00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:07.171
? I WOULD NOT LEAVE YOU ?

374
00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:10.675
? IN TIMES OF TROUBLE ?

375
00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:15.179
? WE NEVER COULD HAVE
COME THIS FAR ?


376
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.181
? MM
-MM ?

377
00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:20.685
? I TOOK THE GOOD TIMES ?

378
00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.688
? I'LL TAKE
THE BAD TIMES... ?


379
00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.689
HI, DOROTHY.

380
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.190
HOW ARE YOU?

381
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:27.692
OH, HI.

382
00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.694
THAT'S HIM.

383
00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.195
WHO?

384
00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:34.199
THE BIGMOUTH.
THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.


385
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.202
YEAH, THAT'S HIM,
ALL RIGHT.


386
00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:38.704
A JOCK.

387
00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.205
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

388
00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:43.709
JUST BY THE SMART-ASS
WAY HE SAID YOUR NAME.


389
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.212
DOES HE THINK I'M STUPID
NOT TO PICK UP ON THAT?


390
00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.217
OH, NOW, DON'T START
ANY TROUBLE, PLEASE?


391
00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:55.219
HA HA. IT WON'T BE
ANY TROUBLE.


392
00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:01.726
? ...ALTHOUGH I MIGHT NOT
SEEM TO CARE ?


393
00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:05.229
? I DON'T WANT CLEVER ?

394
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.232
? CONVERSATION ?

395
00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.735
JESUS CHRIST!
WHO DID THAT?


396
00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.738
EXCUSE US.

397
00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.240
VERY FUNNY.
BIG JOKE, EH?


398
00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.745
YOU HURT HIM, PAUL,
DIDN'T YOU?


399
00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:22.747
HA. NOT ENOUGH,
THE PRICK.


400
00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:28.253
? I WANT YOU
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE ?


401
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.056
I'M VERY ROMANTIC,

402
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.058
AND I LIKE
LITTLE SURPRISES


403
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.561
AND, YOU KNOW, LITTLE
GESTURES LIKE FLOWERS


404
00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:55.063
OR A CALL WHEN
YOU DON'T EXPECT IT,


405
00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.565
AND, YOU KNOW,
THINGS LIKE THAT.


406
00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:59.067
NOT... NOT SEXUAL THINGS.

407
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.569
Interviewer: WELL,
WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU


408
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.569
IF I ASKED YOU

409
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.572
TO TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES
RIGHT NOW?


410
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.073
WOULD YOU DO IT?

411
00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:06.574
NO.

412
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.576
WELL, WHY NOT?

413
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:11.079
THAT'S...

414
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.582
THAT'S NOT ROMANTIC.
THAT'S...


415
00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:19.588
Dorothy: IT TOOK ME FIVE 5
TO SHOOT MY PLAYMATE LAYOUT.


416
00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.589
I SHOT OVER

417
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.590
Paul: SIT UP,

418
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.092
PUT YOUR KNEES TOGETHER
AND HUG 'EM.


419
00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.094
Dorothy:
LIKE THIS?


420
00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:26.095
LIKE THAT.

421
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.598
THAT'S NICE.

422
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.608
HOW ABOUT OPENING
THE SHIRT A LITTLE?


423
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:43.611
I CAN'T.

424
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.613
OH, YES, YOU CAN.

425
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.616
IT'S FUN.

426
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.123
OK.

427
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:56.625
OK.

428
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.143
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

429
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.646
PAUL.

430
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:21.150
WET YOUR LIPS
AND OPEN YOUR MOUTH.


431
00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:22.650
WHAT?

432
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:25.653
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU
DID LAST NIGHT.


433
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:27.155
PAUL.

434
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.162
I CAN DO THAT.

435
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:48.177
DOROTHY?

436
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:41.730

GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN, MOM.


454
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.783
IT GOT SO LATE,

455
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:36.785
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE SLEEPING.


456
00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:38.653
I DIDN'T
WANT TO WAKE YOU.


457
00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:43.759
I'M STAYING OVER

458
00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:46.761
NO, I'M NOT WITH HIM.

459
00:25:46.762 --> 00:25:49.262
Man: WELL, HE SHOWED
ME SOME POLAROIDS,


460
00:25:49.263 --> 00:25:50.765
AND WANTED ME TO DO
SOME TEST SHOTS.


461
00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:53.267
AND WE, UH,
WE MADE A DEAL.


462
00:25:53.268 --> 00:25:55.270
IF SHE GOT ACCEPTED,
I'D GET $1,000.


463
00:25:55.771 --> 00:25:56.770
OTHERWISE, NOTHING.

464
00:25:56.771 --> 00:25:58.273
THAT'S THE USUAL
FINDER'S FEE


465
00:25:58.274 --> 00:26:01.275
THAT <i>PLAYBOY</i> PAYS...
A THOUSAND.


466
00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:02.777
HE REALLY BELIEVED
IN THIS GIRL,


467
00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:05.280
OR ELSE HE JUST
WANTED TO SCREW HER.


468
00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:08.783
I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHICH, MAYBE BOTH.


469
00:26:08.784 --> 00:26:10.785
ANYWAY,
HE CONVINCED ME.

WAS A SECURITY BLANKET.


479
00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:32.807
HERE, COME ON, JUST RELAX.

480
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:33.808
YEAH.

481
00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.810
ARCH YOUR BACK.

482
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.309
TUCK IN THE TUMMY.

483
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.313
I THINK WERE GONNA LIKE
THAT THAT MUCH BETTER.


484
00:26:38.314 --> 00:26:40.314
EXCUSE ME.

485
00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.316
SORRY.

486
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.821
THAT'S IT.
GOOD GIRL.


487
00:26:45.822 --> 00:26:49.324
THAT'S PERFECT.

488
00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:50.325
RIGHT THERE!

489
00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:51.827
LOOK OVER HERE,
DOROTHY,


490
00:26:51.828 --> 00:26:53.327
AND OPEN
YOUR MOUTH.


491
00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:55.330
WHAT STOP
ARE YOU USING?


492
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.833
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?


493
00:27:08.343 --> 00:27:09.844
LISTEN, DOROTHY, I'M GONNA
WAIT IN THE DRESSING ROOM.


494
00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:11.846
TOO MANY DIRECTORS.

495
00:27:12.347 --> 00:27:13.348
OK.

496
00:27:20.856 --> 00:27:22.357
NOW MAYBE WE CAN
GET SOME WORK DONE.


497
00:27:22.358 --> 00:27:24.358
THAT'S GOOD.

498
00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:25.359
ALL RIGHT.

499
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.360
ALL RIGHT,

500
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:27.862
NOW THROW YOUR HEAD
BACK A LITTLE BIT


501
00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:28.864
AND GIVE ME A SMILE.

502
00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:31.866
OK, THAT'S GOOD.

503
00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:34.869
OK, NOW GIVE ME
A LITTLE POUT.


504
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.371
THAT A GIRL.
THAT'S GOOD.


505
00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:40.374
OK, NOW, RELAX
THE HANDS AGAIN.


506
00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:41.876
NOW, THINK ABOUT
AN ANIMAL.


507
00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:42.877
OK.

508
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:45.379
YEAH, MAKE IT
A WILD ANIMAL.


509
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.382
IT'S STARTING TO
GET HOT IN HERE!


510
00:27:47.883 --> 00:27:48.882
THAT'S THE WAY.

511
00:27:48.883 --> 00:27:50.383
THAT'S THE WAY.
ALL RIGHT.


512
00:27:50.384 --> 00:27:51.384
YES, ALL RIGHT.

513
00:27:51.385 --> 00:27:53.226
NOW, THE LITTLE GIRL
IS STARTING TO LEARN HERE.


514
00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:55.389
LET'S GO. NICE.

515
00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.150
OH, THAT'S GOOD. NOW,
HOLD THAT, THAT'S NICE.


516
00:27:57.392 --> 00:27:58.893
HA HA.
YES, YES.


517
00:27:58.894 --> 00:28:00.395
LITTLE GIRL
IS GROWING UP.


518
00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:02.897
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.


519
00:28:02.898 --> 00:28:04.399
OH, THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE. HOLD THAT.


520
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.399
HOLD THAT.

521
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.901
OH, YES, YES, YES!

522
00:28:06.902 --> 00:28:08.903
YES, YES, YES, YES.

523
00:28:08.904 --> 00:28:10.405
Woman: SHE'S LIKE
A BIG, SWEET KID.


524
00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:11.406
POLITE, TOO.

525
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:12.407
NO SCARS.

526
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:15.910
MAYBE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING WITH HER HAIR.


527
00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:17.913
NOT OVERWEIGHT.
I LIKE HER A LOT.


528
00:28:17.914 --> 00:28:18.913
HOW OLD?

529
00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.414
18, I THINK.

530
00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:21.414
Photographer: NOW,

531
00:28:21.415 --> 00:28:22.417
HERE'S WHAT
THE SON OF A BITCH DID.


532
00:28:22.418 --> 00:28:24.418
NOW, I WORKED
MY ASS OFF.


533
00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:25.920
THEN HE TURNS AROUND

534
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.321
AND HE GOES
TO ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER,


535
00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:29.424
AND HE USES MY STUFF TO
CONVINCE THE OTHER GUY


536
00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:30.925
THAT THE GIRL IS GOOD.

537
00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.928
THEN HE SENDS
THE OTHER GUY'S TEST


538
00:28:32.929 --> 00:28:33.928
INTO <i>PLAYBOY</i>

539
00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:35.430
AND SCREWS ME OUT
OF THE FINDER'S FEE...


540
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:36.430
A 1,000 BUCKS.

541
00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:38.866
HA HA HA. I MEAN,
THE GUY IS A BASTARD.


542
00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:41.635
THEY'LL FLY HER
TO L.A. FIRST-CLASS,


543
00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.636
TAKE SOME MORE
TEST SHOTS OF HER,


544
00:28:43.637 --> 00:28:45.139
AND THEN THEY'LL DECIDE

545
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.641
IF THEY WANT TO USE HER
IN THE MAGAZINE OR NOT.


546
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.143
THAT'S REALLY
ALL THERE IS TO IT.


547
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:50.644
THAT'S ALL, HUH?

548
00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.646
BUT WE DO
NEED YOUR CONSENT


549
00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:54.148
BECAUSE OF HER AGE.

550
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:56.150
AND IF I DON'T SIGN?

551
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:59.153
THEN WE BOTH
JUMP OUT A WINDOW.


552
00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:01.156
NO, SERIOUSLY,
IF YOU DON'T SIGN,


553
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:04.159
THEN IT'S...
ALL OFF.


554
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:09.163
SHE WANTS TO GO.

555
00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:12.666
I'M SLOWLY BEGINNING
TO GET THE IDEA


556
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:14.668
THAT YOU WANT HER TO GO.

557
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:17.171
THAT LEAVES ME,
HER MOTHER.


558
00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:24.678
I KNOW THIS COULD BE A
REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US.


559
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:26.680
IT COULD CHANGE
OUR LIVES.


560
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:28.682
WHAT IS THIS "US," "OUR"?

561
00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:31.185
I DON'T SEE ANY NAKED
PICTURES OF YOU HERE, PAUL.


562
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.386
I DON'T SEE
ANY PICTURES OF YOU


563
00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:33.686
WITH YOUR PRIVATES
HANGING OUT


564
00:29:33.687 --> 00:29:35.189
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
TO LOOK AT.


565
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.192
LET'S GET THE CAMERA.
I'M WILLING.


566
00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:39.694
OH, I BET YOU ARE.

567
00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:44.198
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

568
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.201
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
WALK AROUND THE HOUSE


569
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:48.702
IN A NIGHTGOWN
BEFORE SHE MET YOU.


570
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:50.705
DO YOU KNOW WHO READS <i>PLAYBOY?</i>

571
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.207
NO, TELL ME.

572
00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:54.708
MOVIE PRODUCERS,
DIRECTORS,


573
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:56.710
AGENTS, TV PEOPLE.

574
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:59.213
THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE
<i>CHARLIE'S ANGELS</i>


575
00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:00.714
READ <i>PLAYBOY.</i>

576
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:03.217
I HAVE THIS FEELING
ABOUT DOROTHY,


577
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.718
THIS HUNCH THAT SHE'S
GONNA BE A BIG STAR


578
00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:08.222
IN THE MOVIES OR ON TV,
I DON'T KNOW,


579
00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:09.724
BUT A REALLY BIG STAR.

580
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:11.724
BUT SHE'S
GONNA NEED HELP.


581
00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:12.727
YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

582
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:14.228
YOU NEED SOMEBODY.

583
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.231
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
THAT SOMEBODY?


584
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:18.232
I KNOW ALL THE TRICKS,

585
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:20.234
I KNOW
ALL THE CON GAMES.


586
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.736
HEY, I KNOW ALL
THE BULLSHITTING.


587
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:24.239
THERE'S PLENTY
OF THAT, BELIEVE ME.


588
00:30:24.739 --> 00:30:27.241
TOGETHER,
WE COULD BE SOMEBODY.


589
00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:29.243
PEOPLE WOULD
KNOW WHO WE ARE.


590
00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:30.743
PEOPLE WOULD
KNOW OUR NAMES.


591
00:30:30.744 --> 00:30:33.247
PEOPLE WOULD TREAT US
THAT SPECIAL WAY,


592
00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:35.249
THE WAY
THEY TREAT STARS.


593
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.250
PEOPLE WOULD...

594
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:39.254
HELL, WE'D WALK INTO
A RESTAURANT, PEOPLE...


595
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:45.760
I DO LOVE HER.

596
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.761
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

597
00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:49.263
I SAID I LOVE HER.

598
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:52.767
FUNNY. I COULD HAVE SWORN
YOU SAID, "I LOVE <i>IT."</i>


599
00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:55.770
YOU DON'T LIKE
ME, DO YOU?


600
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.275
I LOVE DOROTHY.

601
00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:01.776
THE ANSWER'S NO.

602
00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:03.278
WHY?

603
00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:04.779
GIVE ME A REASON.

604
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.781
I DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE YOU A REASON.


605
00:31:06.782 --> 00:31:08.282
I'M HER MOTHER.

606
00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:09.784
THAT'S THE REASON.

607
00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:11.786
THAT'S THE REASON.

608
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.788
[LOUDSPEAKER]
<i>YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.</i>


609

610
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:19.794
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

611
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:22.797
YOU'RE DYING
TO GO.


612
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:26.801
I WISH YOU
WERE COMING WITH ME.


613
00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:29.802
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING
AT US. DID YOU NOTICE?


614
00:31:29.803 --> 00:31:30.803
YEAH, A LITTLE.

615
00:31:30.804 --> 00:31:32.807
STRAIGHTEN UP, ANGEL.
YOU'RE SLOUCHING.


616
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:33.807
BETTER?

617
00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:34.809
MAKES YOU LOOK TALLER.

618
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.311
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE
A QUEEN.


619
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:41.815
Mom: I NEVER SIGNED IT.

620
00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:44.318
SOMEHOW IT GOT SIGNED, YES.

621
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:47.321
BUT I DIDN'T SIGN IT.

622
00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:50.324
I CAN ONLY GUESS HOW.

623
00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.829
I NEVER
WOULD HAVE SIGNED IT.


624
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:06.173
HAVE YOU
MET HIM YET?


625
00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:07.174
Dorothy: WHO?

626
00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:08.676
THE MAN. THE MAN. HEFNER.

627
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:11.178
OH, PAUL,
HE'S WONDERFUL,


628
00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:14.181
LIKE A FATHER
OR SOMETHING.


629
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.683
OH, EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY.


630
00:32:15.684 --> 00:32:17.184
THAT'S OK.

631
00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:18.686
WHERE ARE YOU
CALLING FROM?


632
00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:21.188
MR. HEFNER'S HOUSE.

633
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:22.690
YOU MEAN
THE MANSION?

YOU COULD BE HERE.

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:30.196
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS


638
00:32:30.197 --> 00:32:31.199
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

639
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.702
I SUDDENLY FEEL
REALLY UGLY.


640
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.203
IS JIMMY CAAN THERE?

641
00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:37.204
WHO?

642
00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:39.707
SONNY CORLEONE
IN THE <i>GODFATHER.</i>


643
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.209
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

644
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.212
HE'S PROBABLY THERE.
HE AND HEF ARE PALS.


645
00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:46.213
WHO DID YOU MEET?

646
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:47.715
OH, SO MANY PEOPLE.

647
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.216
LET ME THINK.

648
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.719
I THINK HE'S A FAMOUS
ATHLETE OR SOMETHING.


649
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.721
NAME'S BILLY BOB,

650
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:56.223
OR WILLY JOE,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.


651
00:32:56.224 --> 00:32:57.725
BATTON?
BILLY JOE BATTON?


652
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:00.226
HE SORT OF HALF SMILES
ALL THE TIME.


653
00:33:00.227 --> 00:33:02.230
HA HA. WELL, WATCH OUT
FOR THAT SMILE.


654
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:04.732
HE'S A REAL COCKSMAN.

655
00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:06.734
GOT A BAD REPUTATION.

656
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:08.235
IS TELLY THERE?

657
00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:09.737
DID YOU MEET TELLY?

658
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:11.739
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M NOT SURE.


659
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.240
OK, DOROTHY,
WHEN YOU MEET PEOPLE,


660
00:33:14.241 --> 00:33:15.743
YOU SHOULD
REALLY MAKE AN EFFORT


661
00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:17.243
TO TRY TO
REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.


662
00:33:17.244 --> 00:33:18.746
IT MAKES
A GOOD IMPRESSION.


663
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.247
I'LL TRY FROM NOW ON.

664
00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:22.750
PAUL, EVERYTHING
IS HAPPENING SO FAST.


665
00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.252
IT'S A LITTLE BANANAS.

666
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.253
LET'S SEE,

667
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:27.253
THEY'RE GOING TO
SHOOT SOME MORE SHOTS


668
00:33:27.254 --> 00:33:29.757
OR WHATEVER THEY
CALL THEM, AND THEY SAY


669
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:32.258
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
ANNIVERSARY PLAYMATE,


670
00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:34.262
BUT THEY DID SAY
I'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE,


671
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.763
A VERY GOOD CHANCE

672
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:37.263
OF BEING
CENTERFOLD FOR AUGUST.


673
00:33:37.264 --> 00:33:40.268
MR. HEFNER WILL MAKE
THE DECISION NEXT WEEK.


674
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:43.771
ISN'T IT TERRIFIC?
I AM SO EXCITED.


675
00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:44.773
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

676
00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:46.273
MR. HEFNER?

677
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:47.775
OH, NICE, LIKE I SAID.

678
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.276
BUT I GET THE FEELING

679
00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:50.517
THAT EVERYBODY
TREMBLES A LITTLE


680
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:51.780
WHEN THEY
MENTION HIS NAME.


681
00:33:51.781 --> 00:33:55.282
YOU KNOW, "MR. HEFNER
WANTS TO SEE YOU."


682
00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:56.784
WAS HE WEARING PAJAMAS?

683
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:58.285
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

684
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:00.788
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
HAVE THIS TALK


685
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:01.790
WITH YOU FOR A WHILE,

686
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.791
BUT I GUESS WE'VE BEEN
KEEPING YOU PRETTY BUSY.


687
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:04.792
I'LL SAY.

688
00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:06.793
COFFEE FOR
MISS STRATTEN. YES, SIR.


689
00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:09.295
DOROTHY, IT'S GOING TO
TAKE A COUPLE WEEKS OR SO


690
00:34:09.296 --> 00:34:12.300
TO COME TO A DECISION
ON THIS THING, ET CETERA.


691
00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:14.802
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

692
00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:16.303
THANK YOU.

693
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:17.805
HAVE A SEAT.

694
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:21.309
IN THE MEANTIME, I IMAGINE
YOU COULD USE SOME MONEY.


695
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.309
YES, I COULD.

696
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.811
I THOUGHT SO.

697
00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:26.813
ANYWAY, OUR PEOPLE THOUGHT
WE COULD FIT YOU IN


698
00:34:26.814 --> 00:34:28.817
AS A BUNNY AT OUR CLUB
IN CENTURY CITY.


699
00:34:28.818 --> 00:34:30.318
TIPS ARE PRETTY GOOD.

700
00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:32.319
THAT'LL BE JUST FINE.

701
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.822
AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN'T
GET THEM TO FIND YOU


702
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:36.825
A LITTLE APARTMENT
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING.


703
00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:38.826
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE.

704
00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.327
IN THE MEANTIME,

705
00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:41.829
YOU CAN STAY HERE,
IF YOU'D LIKE,


706
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.329
IN ONE OF
THE GUEST ROOMS.


707
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.931
WELL, I CAN LOOK FOR
AN APARTMENT MYSELF.


708
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:46.834
NO. WE'LL DO
ALL THAT FOR YOU.


709
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:47.834
ANYWAY, I HAVE A FEELING

710
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:49.337
IT'S ALL VERY
TEMPORARY, DOROTHY.


711
00:34:49.338 --> 00:34:50.337
I THINK

712
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:51.839
THERE ARE VERY BIG
THINGS AHEAD FOR YOU.


713
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.841
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

714
00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:54.541
BUT I'LL CERTAINLY
TRY FOR YOU.


715
00:34:54.843 --> 00:34:55.844
I KNOW YOU WILL.

716
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.346
WELL, THAT JUST
LEAVES MY, UH,


717
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:00.347
MY SPEECH.

718
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:01.348
READY?

719
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:02.349
YES, SIR.

720
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.350
<i>PLAYBOY</i>

721
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.351
IS A VERY SPECIAL
MAGAZINE, DOROTHY.


722
00:35:05.352 --> 00:35:06.854
THERE'S NO OTHER
MAGAZINE LIKE IT.


723
00:35:06.855 --> 00:35:08.354
ALL THE WRITERS,
EDITORS, PHOTOGRAPHERS,


724
00:35:08.355 --> 00:35:09.857
ALL THE GIRLS,
ET CETERA,


725
00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:12.860
WE ALL HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.


726
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:14.863
IT'S NOT LIKE
ANY OTHER MAGAZINE.


727
00:35:14.864 --> 00:35:16.363
WE'RE ALL LIKE A...

728
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:18.366
WELL, WE'RE
JUST LIKE A FAMILY.


729
00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:19.366
A FAMILY.

730
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.368
IT'S LIKE
HAVING A FAMILY.


731
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:22.368
[WHISPERING] The whole magazine

732
00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.371
is like having a family.

733
00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:24.871
THE WHOLE MAGAZINE

734
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:26.374
IS LIKE
HAVING A FAMILY.


735
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:27.375
SEE?

736
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:29.876
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
SAY THAT'S A LOT OF BULL,


737
00:35:29.877 --> 00:35:31.377
BUT THAT'S HOW
I THINK OF IT.


738
00:35:31.378 --> 00:35:33.381
THAT'S HOW WE ALL
THINK OF IT.


739
00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:36.383
IT'S KIND OF A WORLD
WITHIN A WORLD.


740
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.885
IT'S A...

741
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.387
WELL, IT'S A FAMILY.

742
00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:42.388
Dorothy: WASN'T THAT
NEAT ABOUT THE JOB


743
00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:43.891
AND THE APARTMENT
AND EVERYTHING?


744
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:45.892
HEY, LISTEN, IT ALL
SOUNDS TERRIFIC.


745
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:47.393
AND, GOD, MEETING
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.


746
00:35:47.394 --> 00:35:48.896
THEY'RE GOOD CONTACTS.
IT CAN ONLY HELP.


747
00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:49.898
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

748
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:50.898
I THINK SO.

749
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:52.900
I'LL CALL
TOMORROW.


750
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:53.901
I LOVE YOU.

751
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:56.403
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
BYE.


752
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:57.405
THANKS, JOHNNY.

753
00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:00.407
THAT WAS
SOME PHONE CALL.


754
00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:01.409
HOW'S THE KID DOING?

755
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.910
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
GOING REALLY RIGHT.


756
00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:05.411
SHE WAS CALLING
FROM HEF'S PLACE.


757
00:36:05.412 --> 00:36:07.915
JOHNNY, BE A PAL AND POUR ME
ABOUT THAT MUCH SCOTCH.


758
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:09.917
SHE'S IN
THE MANSION?


759
00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:12.919
BILLY JOE BATTON
IS MAKING A BIG PLAY FOR HER.


760
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.420
BILLY JOE BATTON
THE FOOTBALL PLAYER...


761
00:36:14.421 --> 00:36:15.923
MAKING A MOVE
ON DOROTHY?


762
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:16.923
AH, IT FIGURES.

763
00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:18.424
THAT'S THE KIND
OF TOWN L.A. IS.


764
00:36:18.425 --> 00:36:20.428
JESUS CHRIST... I'D
BE GOING OUTTA MY SKULL


765
00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:21.929
IF BILLY JOE BATTON

766
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.431
WAS TRYING TO GET
IN MY GIRL'S PANTS.


767
00:36:23.432 --> 00:36:24.932
AH... WHAT'S HER NAME?

768
00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.935
? OFF RAMP,
IT'S THE BEST ?


769
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:29.436
? TAKE ME OFF RAMP ?

770
00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:30.438
? OFF RAMP ?

771
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:31.940
? YOU'RE MY BEST ?

772
00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:33.440
? OFF RAMP ?

773
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.443
? DOO-DOO DOO-DOO
DOO-DOO DOO-DOO ?


774
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.945
? DOO-DOO DOO-DOO
DOO-DOO DOO-DOO ?


775
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.947
? OFF RAMP! ?

776
00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:40.947
I DON'T LIKE TO DO, LIKE,

777
00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:43.115
BLACK DUDES AND WHITE
DUDES KIND OF STUFF,


778
00:36:43.116 --> 00:36:44.116
BUT THE THING I'VE NOTICED

779
00:36:44.117 --> 00:36:46.118
ABOUT BLACK DUDES
AND WHITE DUDES


780
00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:49.623
IS THAT, LIKE, BLACK PEOPLE
CHASTISE THEIR KIDS MORE.


781
00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:50.625
AND AS A RESULT,

782
00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:52.124
YOU DON'T SEE BLACK PEOPLE
DOING CRAZY THINGS,


783
00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:54.126
LIKE SHOOTING THE PRESIDENT.
THAT'S TRUE,


784
00:36:54.127 --> 00:36:55.127
'CAUSE IF A BROTHER WOULD
HAVE SHOT THE PRESIDENT,


785
00:36:55.128 --> 00:36:56.630
AS THEY WERE LEADING HIM
AWAY, IT'D BE LIKE,


786
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.631
"LOOK, MAN, JUST DON'T
TELL MY MAMA, MAN.


787
00:36:58.632 --> 00:37:00.635
MY MAMA GONNA
KILL ME, MAN..."


788
00:37:00.636 --> 00:37:02.637
HERE SHE COMES.

789
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.142
THAT'S ROOM

790
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:09.643
219.

791
00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:11.145
AT THE BEVERLY
HILTON.


792
00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:14.147
NO, I CAN'T, REALLY.

793
00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:17.651
OOPS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.


794
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:21.154
THAT'S CALLED
THE BUNNY DIP.


795
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:24.658
Dorothy: <i>PLAYBOY'S</i> MOTTO
IS "THE GIRL NEXT DOOR."


796
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.660
THEY LOOK FOR GIRLS

797
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:29.162
THAT ARE WHOLESOME AND
FRESH AND YOUNG AND NAIVE.


798
00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:31.665
THEY LOOK FOR ALL OF THAT,
SO MOST OF THOSE GIRLS


799
00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:36.169
DO, UH, HAVE THAT TYPE
OF BACKGROUND.


800
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.671
YOU KNOW, SNIDER,

801
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.674
I HAVE THIS THEORY
ABOUT YOU.


802
00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:41.174
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

803
00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:43.175
I THINK THE REASON WHY
YOU'RE SO GOOD IN BED


804
00:37:43.176 --> 00:37:45.679
IS BECAUSE YOU
JUST PLAIN TRY HARDER.


805
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.182
I MEAN, BABY, YOU
PUT IN AN 8-HOUR DAY


806
00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:49.683
IN 15 MINUTES.

807
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.184
HA HA HA!

808
00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:52.686
Dorothy, on answering
machine: <i>HI, IT'S ME.</i>


809
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:53.688
<i>I CALLED EARLIER, TOO,</i>

810
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:55.668
HOLD IT.
<i>BUT I DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE.</i>


811
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.189
<i>I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW</i>

812
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.190
<i>THAT I HAD TO WORK LATE,</i>

813
00:37:58.191 --> 00:37:59.693
<i>BUT I'LL CALL AGAIN</i>
<i>WHEN I GET HOME.</i>


814
00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:01.696
<i>OH, THANKS FOR THE FLOWERS.</i>
<i>THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.</i>


815
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:03.196
OOH, FLOWERS.

816
00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:04.196
<i>THESE MACHINES</i>
<i>MAKE ME SO NERVOUS.</i>


817
00:38:04.197 --> 00:38:06.198
<i>I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>IF I DON'T TALK FAST,</i>


818
00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:07.701
<i>MY 30 SECONDS WILL RUN OUT.</i>

819
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:09.201
<i>YES, I THINK IT WOULD BE</i>
<i>A TERRIFIC IDEA</i>


820
00:38:09.202 --> 00:38:10.704
<i>IF YOU TAKE EILEEN</i>
<i>TO THE CARNIVAL.</i>


821
00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:11.705
<i>SHE'D LOVE IT.</i>

822
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:13.708
<i>JUST DON'T LET HER</i>
<i>EAT TOO MUCH JUNK FOOD.</i>


823
00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:16.209
<i>I LOVE YOU. BYE.</i>
<i>WHEW, I MADE IT.</i>


824
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.712
THAT MUST BE
NUMBER ONE.


825
00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.714
I BET YOU WAS
SCARED AS HELL


826
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:22.716
SHE WAS OUT
LAST NIGHT


827
00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:24.718
DOIN' WHAT
WE JUST DID.


828
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.720
LOOK I GOT TO
GET UP EARLY,


829
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.724
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET
THE FUCK OUTTA HERE?


830
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.242
? LET IT HANG OUT, BABY ?

831
00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:52.245
? LET IT HANG OUT NOW ?

832
00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:54.248
? NOW, NOW
-NOW
-NOW ?

833
00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.751
? LET IT HANG OUT, BABY ?

834
00:38:58.252 --> 00:39:00.754
? EVERYBODY WORK OUT ?

835
00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.258
? SOOKIE, SOOKIE, SOOKIE,
SOOKIE ?


836
00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:06.259
? SOOKIE SOOKIE SOOO! ?

837
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.263
? LET IT HANG OUT, BABY ?

838
00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:12.186
? DO THE BOOMERANG... ?

839
00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:13.767
WE GOT THE BEST ONE,
SWEETHEART.


840
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.769
WE GOT A MERCEDES.

841
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.272
? LET IT HANG OUT, BABY ?

842
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:19.772
WHAT CAN
I GET YOU?


843
00:39:19.773 --> 00:39:21.273
UH, 2 HOT DOGS,
MUSTARD AND RELISH,


844
00:39:21.274 --> 00:39:23.275
2 ORANGE DRINKS, A BAG
OF POTATO CHIPS, FRIES.


845
00:39:23.276 --> 00:39:24.278
AND 2 CARAMEL CORN.

846
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:26.780
BUT NO JUNK FOOD.
RIGHT?


847
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:27.781
RIGHT.

848
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:29.784
YOU KNOW, THAT HEALTH
FOOD'LL KILL YOU.


849
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.288
DON'T GO
ON THE ROCKET AGAIN.


850
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:36.289
THAT'S MY RIDE,
SWEETHEART.


851
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.791
EILEEN, STRAIGHTEN UP.

852
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.293
YOU'RE SLOUCHING AGAIN.

853
00:39:39.294 --> 00:39:40.293
I KNOW...

854
00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:43.296
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK
LIKE A CENTERFOLD.


855
00:39:43.297 --> 00:39:44.298
HONEST?
YOU MEAN IT?


856
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:45.799
AUGUST.

857
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.302
OH, MR. HEFNER,
THANK YOU.


858
00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:50.804
Woman: MISS STRATTON,
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?


859
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:53.305
HOW DID SHE FEEL ABOUT
YOUR PHOTOS IN <i>PLAYBOY?</i>


860
00:39:53.306 --> 00:39:55.809
I DON'T THINK SHE LIKED
IT AT ALL AT FIRST,


861
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.812
BUT THEN SHE STARTED
GETTING CALLS FROM


862
00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:01.815
SEVERAL OF HER FRIENDS
CONGRATULATING HER,


863
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.316
AND SHE SAID TO ME,

864
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.818
"I FEEL
LIKE A MOVIE STAR."


865
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:06.320
I MEAN,
SHE WAS SO EXCITED.


866
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:08.321
$10,000!

867
00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:10.324
THEY'RE GONNA
GIVE ME $10,000


868
00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:12.326
FOR HAVING
MY PICTURE TAKEN.


869
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:13.828
FEELS GOOD, HUH?

870
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:16.329
OH, YES. YES.

871
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.833
DOROTHY, DO YOU
REALLY LOVE ME?


872
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.336
YES. YES, I DO.

873
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:23.838
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

874
00:40:24.338 --> 00:40:25.419
HERE'S HOW
IT LAYS OUT THEN.


875
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.839
I'LL GRAB A PLANE
BY WEDNESDAY,


876
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.842
THURSDAY
AT THE LATEST,


877
00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:29.341
AND I'LL BE THERE.

878
00:40:29.342 --> 00:40:30.344
WELL, I WOULDN'T
HAVE THAT MUCH TIME


879
00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.845
TO SPEND WITH YOU.

880
00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:33.848
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE GOT ME
RUNNING ALL DAY LONG.


881
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:35.508
THEN WHEN WE
GET SOME TIME,


882
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.370
WE'LL JUST RUN OVER
TO VEGAS AND DO IT.


883
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:39.353
WE'LL JUST DO IT,
RIGHT?


884
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.354
DO IT? DO WHAT?

885
00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:43.356
HOW ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED?


886
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:45.859
WE'LL GET MARRIED,
DOROTHY...


887
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.361
MAKE IT PERMANENT,
JUST LIKE THAT.


888
00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:52.366
WE'LL MAKE IT
A PERMANENT TEAM...


889
00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:54.368
FOR LIFE.

890
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.371
WE HAD EVERYTHING
GOING FOR US,


891
00:40:58.372 --> 00:41:01.875
BUT YOU FUCKS
WOULDN'T LET ME IN.


892
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.378
BIG FUCKING DEAL.

893
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:07.380
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR MAGAZINE,


894
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:08.382
YOUR MANSION,
AND YOUR MOVIES


895
00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:12.385
AND SHOVE THEM
ALL UP YOUR ASS NOW.


896
00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:13.787
LIAR!

897
00:41:13.788 --> 00:41:15.388
I HAVE MISSED YOU.

898
00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:18.392
I HAVE MISSED YOU
SO MUCH.


899
00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:25.899
GUESS WE
SHOULD GO, HUH?


900
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:39.913
SOMEBODY TOLD MR. HEFNER
I WAS GOING TO PICK YOU UP.


901
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:42.416
IT'S HIS PERSONAL CAR.

902
00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:44.918
A LITTLE EMBARRASSING,
ISN'T IT?


903
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:45.919
NO.

904
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.922
? ...TO THE GULF
OF MEXICO ?


905
00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:51.424
? TO LAKE CHARLES,
LOUISIANA ?


906
00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:54.928
? LITTLE BESSIE GIRL
THAT I ONCE KNEW ?


907
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.431
? SHE TOLD ME JUST TO
COME ON BY ?


908
00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:02.435
? IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT SHE COULD DO ?


909
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:05.939
? UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK,
SHE SENDS ME ?


910
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.442
? IF I SPRING A LEAK,
SHE MENDS ME ?


911
00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:12.445
? I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK,
SHE DEFENDS ME ?


912
00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:17.451
? A DRUNKARD'S DREAM
IF I EVER DID SEE ONE ?


913
00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:21.955
? GOOD-LUCK HAG,
SHE STUNG ME ?


914
00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:24.458
? TO THE RACE TRACK
I DID GO... ?


915
00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:25.458
HI.

916
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:26.459
HI.

917
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.459
YOU'RE DOROTHY.

918
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.460
WE MET THE OTHER
NIGHT.


919
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:30.464
OH, YES.
THIS IS PAUL SNIDER.


920
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.967
AND YOU ARE...
I'M SORRY. I FORGOT.


921
00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:34.968
THAT'S OK. I'M...

922
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:35.970
VINCE ROBERTS.

923
00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:38.472
I'M A BIG FAN.

924
00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:39.973
THANKS.

925
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.475
HEY, LISTEN, THAT WAS
MY FAVORITE TV SHOW.


926
00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:42.976
THANK YOU.

927
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:44.978
CANCELED, HUH?

928
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:45.979
YEAH.

929
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.481
ANY CHANCE THEY'LL
BRING IT BACK?


930
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:49.483
I DON'T
THINK SO.


931
00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:50.984
AH, TOO BAD.

932
00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:52.484
AREN'T MANY ACTORS
AROUND LIKE YOU.


933
00:42:52.485 --> 00:42:53.987
THEY'RE ALL LIGHTWEIGHTS.

934
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.990
WE NEED HEAVYWEIGHTS
LIKE YOU.


935
00:42:55.991 --> 00:42:57.992
YOU BREAK MY HEART.

936
00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:02.495
JEEZ, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE THAT SHOW WAS ON.


937
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:03.997
WHAT IS IT,
A YEAR NOW?


938
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:05.498
3.

939
00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:08.001
IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS
SINCE YOU WERE ON TV?


940
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:09.002
YEAH.

941
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:11.005
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

942
00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:12.506
BAD SCRIPTS, HUH?

943
00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:14.507
I GUESS SO.

944
00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:16.509
DOROTHY,
THERE YOU ARE.


945
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.011
EXCUSE ME.

946
00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:19.512
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

947
00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:21.314
GOOD WRITERS ARE REALLY
HARD TO FIND OUT HERE.


948
00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:23.016
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF PROJECTS IN MIND...


949
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:26.018
I COULD USE A GOOD WRITER,
AND I CAN'T FIND ANY.


950
00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:27.519
I MEAN, NOT
A DECENT ONE, ANYWAY,


951
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520
AND WHEN YOU DO,

952
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.024
THEY WON'T DO WHAT
YOU TELL 'EM TO DO.


953
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:34.527
YEAH. SOME WRITERS
ARE LIKE THAT.


954
00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:36.029
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
I'M JUST GONNA...


955
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.029
WELL, I FOR ONE

956
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.032
HOPE YOU'RE BACK
ON THE TUBE REAL SOON.


957
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:40.033
THANKS.

958
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:43.036
UM, ARE YOU WORKING
ON ANYTHING NEW NOW?


959
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.038
JUST READING.

960
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.539
JUST READING.

961
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.041
EXCUSE ME.

962
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.545
SEE YA, VINCE.

963
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.556
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TALKED TO HIM.


964
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:05.559
THERE'S HEF.
STRAIGHTEN UP.


965
00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:09.563
HI, DOROTHY.

966
00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:14.067
LOOK AT HER.
OH, WOW...


967
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.070
ANYTIME.

968
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:18.072
OK.

969
00:44:18.572 --> 00:44:20.572
I SEE YOU GOT HERE
ALL RIGHT.


970
00:44:20.573 --> 00:44:22.576
MR. HEFNER,
THIS IS PAUL SNIDER.


971
00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:24.577
PAUL, MR. HEFNER.

972
00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:28.081
IF A MAN HAS A RIGHT
TO FIND GOD IN HIS OWN WAY,


973
00:44:28.582 --> 00:44:29.582
HE HAS A RIGHT

974
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:31.583
TO GO TO THE DEVIL
IN HIS OWN WAY.


975
00:44:31.584 --> 00:44:32.584
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE...

976
00:44:32.585 --> 00:44:35.088
DESCRIPTIONS OF MURDER
WHICH WE CONSIDER A CRIME


977
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:37.089
ARE ACCEPTABLE IN ART
AND LITERATURE,


978
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.593
BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF SEX
ARE PROHIBITED.


979
00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:42.596
OUR SOCIETY
HAS PUT HATE ABOVE LOVE,


980
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.598
FAVORED KILLING
OVER LIVING.


981
00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:47.100
RIGHT?

982
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:49.602
PRETTY CLOSE,
BUT I THINK


983
00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:52.105
I SAID "FAVORED
DEATH OVER LIFE."


984
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.607
WHAT? I DON'T
UNDERSTAND. WHAT?


985
00:44:54.608 --> 00:44:56.610
HE'S QUOTING ME.
OLD ONES AT THAT.


986
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:58.611
THAT'S GREAT STUFF.

987
00:44:58.612 --> 00:45:01.114
FINE PIECE OF WORK.
FINE...


988
00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:03.615
GOD, I FEEL HEF HERE AND I
ARE OLD FRIENDS.


989
00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:06.618
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE EVEN
HAVE SOME MUTUAL BUDDIES.


990
00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:08.121
IS, UH, TELLY AT THIS BASH?

991
00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:09.122
TELLY?

992
00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:10.123
SAVALAS.

993
00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.623
TELLY SAVALAS.
HE'S AN OLD PAL.


994
00:45:11.624 --> 00:45:12.626
THOUGHT I MIGHT
SEE HIM HERE.


995
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:13.626
OH!

996
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:16.129
HEY, BOBO.

997
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.632
AH, BOBO. BOBO, I WANT YOU
TO MEET DOROTHY STRATTEN.


998
00:45:18.633 --> 00:45:19.632
HI.
HI.


999
00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:22.635
BOBO WELLER.

1000
00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.137
I STILL GOT
YOUR CENTERFOLD


1001
00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:25.139
ON MY WALL.

1002
00:45:25.639 --> 00:45:27.140
OH, WOW.

1003
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:29.143
YOUR FAVORITE BOOK
IS <i>THE HITE REPORT.</i>


1004
00:45:29.144 --> 00:45:32.645
YOU LIKE ROD STEWART,
LINDA RONSTADT,


1005
00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:34.647
AND BOZ SCAGGS, RIGHT?

1006
00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:36.149
OH, WOW.

1007
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.652
I'D KNOW
THAT BOD ANYWHERE.


1008
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:41.154
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
SNIDER.


1009
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:42.155
DOROTHY?

1010
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.156
PAUL.

1011
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:46.159
EXCUSE US A SECOND.
DOROTHY...


1012
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.161
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1013
00:45:47.162 --> 00:45:50.630
UH, I'M
A PERSONAL MANAGER.


1014
00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:52.833
PHIL, SAY HELLO
TO DOROTHY STRATTEN.


1015
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:54.833
HE SAYS SAY HELLO,
YOU SAY HELLO.


1016
00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:56.336
HELLO,
DOROTHY STRATTEN.


1017
00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:57.337
I'M PHIL WASS.

1018
00:45:57.338 --> 00:45:58.839
HELLO.

1019
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.342
PHIL PRODUCES
MOVIES... SOMETIMES.


1020
00:46:01.343 --> 00:46:03.343
DOROTHY'S
OUR MISS AUGUST.


1021
00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:04.624
WE'RE ALL VERY
EXCITED ABOUT HER.


1022
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:05.844
MAYBE IF YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT,


1023
00:46:05.845 --> 00:46:07.347
WE MIGHT JUST
LET YOU PRESENT HER


1024
00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.349
IN HER FILM DEBUT.

1025
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.351
SHE'S A VERY
FINE ACTRESS.


1026
00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:11.851
MR. HEFNER...

1027
00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:12.851
DON'T WORRY. HE DOESN'T
KNOW A DAMN THING


1028
00:46:12.852 --> 00:46:13.854
ABOUT ACTING ANYWAY.

1029
00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:16.355
EXCUSE ME. I'LL
LEAVE YOU 2 ALONE.


1030
00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:19.358
LISTEN, I <i>AM</i> DOING A FILM
CALLED <i>BALL BEARINGS.</i>


1031
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.859
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO DROP
OVER THE OFFICE TOMORROW


1032
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.862
AND MEET THE DIRECTOR.

1033
00:46:22.363 --> 00:46:23.864
WHAT HAVE
I GOT TO LOSE?


1034
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:25.866
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE DIRECTOR.


1035
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:29.869
EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE. YEAH, SURE.


1036
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:30.871
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A PART...


1037
00:46:30.872 --> 00:46:32.372
SHE'LL TAKE IT.

1038
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:33.873
HI. PAUL SNIDER
HERE.


1039
00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:35.375
MISS STRATTEN,

1040
00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:37.878
I SAW YOUR MOVIE DEBUT
IN <i>BALL BEARINGS.</i>


1041
00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:39.379
UH
-OH. HA HA...

1042
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.880
UH
-OH IS RIGHT.

1043
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:42.382
NO, I'M NOT
THE FILM CRITIC,


1044
00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:44.884
BUT THAT WASN'T
MUCH OF A PART.


1045
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:46.887
WELL, I WASN'T MUCH
OF AN ACTRESS, EITHER.


1046
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:49.389
OH? ARE YOU
BETTER NOW?


1047
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.392
OH, GOD, I HOPE SO.
I'M STUDYING.


1048
00:46:51.393 --> 00:46:52.392
THE CLASSICS?

1049
00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:54.895
NO. ACTING. I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC.


1050
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.901
SORRY.
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.


1051
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.906
HEFNER DIDN'T LIKE IT
WHEN I QUOTED HIM.


1052
00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:08.908
I SHOULDA KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT.


1053
00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:09.909
DAMN.

1054
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.412
I THINK IT JUST
SURPRISED HIM.


1055
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:14.914
DUMB MOVE.

1056
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:18.418
MAYBE YOU WERE
A LITTLE NERVOUS.


1057
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:19.419
OH...

1058
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.423
LOOK AT THESE
STUPID CLOTHES.


1059
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:27.928
DUMB MOVE
QUOTING HIM.


1060
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:36.436
YOU KNOW, I WAS
A LITTLE NERVOUS


1061
00:47:36.437 --> 00:47:37.798
THE FIRST NIGHT
I WAS THERE, TOO...


1062
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:40.440
JESUS, WILL YOU
STOP SAYIN' THAT!


1063
00:47:45.946 --> 00:47:48.448
I MEAN, WHY THE HELL
SHOULD I BE NERVOUS


1064
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:50.451
AROUND HEFNER
AND THAT CROWD?


1065
00:47:50.452 --> 00:47:52.452
BUNCH OF SMART ASSES...

1066
00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:55.955
WITH THEIR STUPID,
FAGGY HAIRSTYLES,


1067
00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:57.457
SMUG BASTARDS.

1068
00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:58.957
AND THAT VINCE ROBERTS...

1069
00:47:58.958 --> 00:48:01.461
BOY, DOES HE WANT TO
GET INTO YOUR PANTS.


1070
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:03.963
HE'S NOT GOING TO.

1071
00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:05.966
HE'S ASKED YOU OUT,
HASN'T HE?


1072
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:06.966
YES.

1073
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:08.468
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

1074
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:13.473
I SAID
I HAD A FELLA,


1075
00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:15.476
A STEADY FELLA.

1076
00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:17.478
YOU DID?

1077
00:48:23.484 --> 00:48:25.486
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

1078
00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:27.987
SHOULD WHAT?

1079
00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:28.987
GO OUT WITH HIM.

1080
00:48:28.988 --> 00:48:30.991
HE SAID HE WAS
READING SOME PROJECTS.


1081
00:48:30.992 --> 00:48:34.994
HO, I'M REALLY TIRED.
LET'S GO TO BED.


1082
00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:36.995
DO YOU THINK
HEFNER LIKED ME?


1083
00:48:36.996 --> 00:48:37.996
PAUL, COME ON...

1084
00:48:37.997 --> 00:48:39.499
I DON'T THINK
HE LIKED ME.


1085
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.001
IF HE JUST
GOT TO KNOW ME...


1086
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.429
LOOK, MR. HEFNER,

1087
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.930
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME


1088
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:31.434
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MARRY PAUL?


1089
00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:32.934
YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND, DOROTHY,


1090
00:49:32.935 --> 00:49:33.935
THAT A THIRD PARTY

1091
00:49:33.936 --> 00:49:34.938
IS IN KIND OF A FUNNY
POSITION, ET CETERA,


1092
00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.438
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO
COUNSEL SOMEBODY


1093
00:49:36.439 --> 00:49:37.439
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

1094
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.443
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW
IT'S GOING TO END UP.


1095
00:49:39.444 --> 00:49:40.943
IT'S NOT BECAUSE

1096
00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.446
I'M GOING TO BE
A PLAYMATE, IS IT?


1097
00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:44.947
NO, NO.

1098
00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:45.948
OF COURSE NOT.

1099
00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:47.450
WELL, SOME OF THE
OTHER GIRLS TOLD ME


1100
00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.952
THAT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE THE PLAYMATES


1101
00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:49.952
TO BE MARRIED.

1102
00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.454
FRANKLY, WE THINK
IT'S BETTER FOR THE IMAGE


1103
00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.454
IF THEY'RE NOT.

1104
00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:53.957
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT, DON'T YOU?


1105
00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:55.458
BUT SEVERAL HAVE BEEN.

1106
00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:56.458
JUST A MOMENT, SAM.

1107
00:49:56.459 --> 00:49:57.461
WHO? GIVE ME SOME NAMES.

1108
00:49:57.462 --> 00:49:58.461
CINDY WAS.

1109
00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.962
GINGER, I THINK.

1110
00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.464
THAT'S RIGHT.
CINDY, GINGER...


1111
00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.466
LOOK, HE CAN'T
JUST COME RIGHT OUT


1112
00:50:02.467 --> 00:50:03.966
AND SAY IT.

1113
00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.468
HE'S TRYING TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.


1114
00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.969
I KNOW HE IS,

1115
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.972
AND I THINK I KNOW WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME,


1116
00:50:08.973 --> 00:50:11.974
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE UNDERSTANDS.


1117
00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:14.477
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

1118
00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.479
WELL, HE'S...

1119
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.482
HE'S GOT THE PERSONALITY
OF A PIMP.


1120
00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:22.986
THAT WAS IMPROPER.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.


1121
00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:25.988
OHH, MR. HEFNER,

1122
00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.991
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
HE USED TO DRESS.


1123
00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:30.994
HE DOESN'T DRESS
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.


1124
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.451
OH, GOD...

1125
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.454
I AM SO CONFUSED.

1126
00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:44.957
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY UNDERSTANDS.


1127
00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:46.959
I OWE IT TO HIM.

1128
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.960
MISS STRATTEN,

1129
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:49.462
MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?


1130
00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:51.464
36-24-36.

1131
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:52.964
NO. I HAVE
THAT INFORMATION


1132
00:50:52.965 --> 00:50:53.965
IN THE PRESS RELEASE
RIGHT HERE.


1133
00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:56.469
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE IT SEVERAL TIMES.


1134
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.031
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE MARRIED.


1135
00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:00.473
YES.

1136
00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:01.973
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
ABOUT 3 MONTHS.


1137
00:51:01.974 --> 00:51:02.974
I WONDER WHY YOU
LOOKED AT MISS DAVIS


1138
00:51:02.975 --> 00:51:03.977
WHEN I ASKED YOU THAT.

1139
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.478
NO REASON.

1140
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:06.980
NO REASON? IS HE
TRAVELING WITH YOU?


1141
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:07.980
NO, HE'S NOT.

1142
00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:08.982
AND WHY IS THAT?

1143
00:51:09.483 --> 00:51:10.984
I'D LIKE MISS STRATTEN
TO ANSWER ME...


1144
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:11.984
IF SHE WOULD.

1145
00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:13.986
HE'S IN L.A.
WORKING.


1146
00:51:13.987 --> 00:51:15.488
WHAT SORT OF WORK
DOES HE DO?


1147
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:16.488
HE'S DOING A SHOW.

1148
00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:17.989
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.


1149
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:19.710
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
AGAIN A LITTLE LOUDER?

OF ALL OF OUR BEAUTIFUL,
WELL-HUNG, YOUNG MEN?


1181
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:37.570
OK, GUYS...

1187
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:50.083

SORRY, PAUL.
THOSE ARE THE FIGURES.


1193
00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:12.103
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS PLACE WAS PACKED.


1194
00:53:12.104 --> 00:53:14.607
WELL, THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY
A BUNCH OF BIG SPENDERS.


1195
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:16.610
IT WAS NO SHRINERS
CONVENTION.


1196
00:53:21.114 --> 00:53:22.615
ANY PROJECTS
IN THE OFFING,

00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:24.116
ANY NEW FILMS?

1198
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.618
WELL, WHEN I GO
BACK TO LOS ANGELES,

I START A MOVIE CALLED
<i>WEDNESDAY'S CHILD.</i>


1200
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:31.123
WHAT'S <i>WEDNESDAY'
S CHILD</i> ABOUT?

1201
00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:33.124
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO
SPEND A LOT OF TIME


1202
00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:35.128
WATCHING ME GET
TIED UP AND BEATEN.


1203
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.630
IT'S NOT A CLASSIC.
HA HA.


1204
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:38.630
Man: SAL, WILL YOU

1205
00:53:38.631 --> 00:53:40.632
PUT THE PELLET
IN HER MOUTH, PLEASE?


1206
00:53:40.633 --> 00:53:42.135
CAREFUL NOW.
DON'T BITE IT.


1207
00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.135
THERE'S A CALL
FOR YOU, DOROTHY.


1208
00:53:44.136 --> 00:53:45.638
NOT NOW,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.


1209
00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:48.141
ALL RIGHT, PUT THE GUN
BACK UP TO HER FACE.


1210
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:49.642
HE SAYS HIS LINE,

1211
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:52.145
YOU SHAKE YOU HEAD NO.
HARDER!


1212
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.648
AND THEN HE SLAPS YOU ACROSS
THE FACE WITH THE GUN.


1213
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.650
WHAT?

1214
00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:59.652
YOU BIT THE PELLET.

1215
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:02.154
HA HA...
GOD DAMN IT!


1216
00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:04.657
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
HA HA HA...


1217
00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:06.660
I'M SORRY.
CLEAN HER UP, PLEASE.


1218
00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:10.663
OH, GOD.

1219
00:54:10.664 --> 00:54:12.666
SHOULD I TELL HIM
TO CALL BACK?


1220
00:54:12.667 --> 00:54:15.167
HE'S CALLED 3 TIMES.

1221
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:17.170
FUCKING
BLOOD PELLETS.


1222
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:18.671
JESUS...

1223
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:20.171
LOOK, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,


1224
00:54:20.172 --> 00:54:21.174
BUT I FOUND IT.

1225
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.675
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1226
00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:23.676
PAUL, LISTEN,

1227
00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:25.679
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A VERY GOOD TIME TO TALK.


1228
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:27.379
I AM SITTING HERE
FREAKING OUT.


1229
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:30.181
IT'S A PAUL SNIDER/
DOROTHY STRATTEN CAR


1230
00:54:30.182 --> 00:54:31.684
IF EVER
I'VE SEEN ONE.


1231
00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.685
BUT IT'S A LITTLE
MORE THAN I FIGURED.


1232
00:54:33.686 --> 00:54:34.688
LOOK,
I WAS WONDERING,


1233
00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:36.188
IS THERE ANY WAY

1234
00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:37.690
THAT YOU COULD GET
TO THE BANK TODAY?


1235
00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:38.690
I'D LIKE TO
SIGN THE PAPERS


1236
00:54:38.691 --> 00:54:40.692
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE
GRABS IT.


1237
00:54:40.693 --> 00:54:42.696
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER 3,000.


1238
00:54:45.198 --> 00:54:46.699
ON YOUR LUNCH HOUR
MAYBE?


1239
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.702
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF MONEY LATELY.


1240
00:54:48.703 --> 00:54:50.202
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT.

1241
00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:51.202
THERE'S NOT
A BETTER-LOOKING SET


1242
00:54:51.203 --> 00:54:53.204
OF WHEELS IN THIS
WHOLE FRIGGIN' TOWN.


1243
00:54:53.205 --> 00:54:54.707
Director: DO YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE


1244
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:56.708
TO DRAG MISS STRATTEN
OFF THE PHONE


1245
00:54:56.709 --> 00:54:57.711
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

1246
00:54:57.712 --> 00:54:59.212
HE'LL WAIT.

1247
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:01.214
I'M GONNA GET
A LICENSE PLATE


1248
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:03.716
THAT SPELLS OUT
"STAR 80."


1249
00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:06.218
IT'S FAN-
FUCKING-TASTIC.


1250
00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:09.221
YOU KNOW...
S-T-A-R 8-0?


1251
00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:10.222
THAT'S YOU.

1252
00:55:10.223 --> 00:55:12.225
STAR 80.

1253
00:55:12.726 --> 00:55:13.727
EVERYONE
IN THIS TOWN


1254
00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:16.729
IS GOING TO
KNOW WHO WE ARE.


1255
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.732
CAN YOU GET
TO THE BANK?


1256
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.235
PLEASE?

1257
00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:27.239
OK. OK, I'LL GO
TO THE BANK.


1258
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.741
THAT'S MY QUEEN.

AND MAYBE SINCE I WAS
MOVING MY PRACTICE TO L.A.,


1325

WE COULD
FIND A PLACE TOGETHER,

MOST OF THE TIME,

I DOUBT IT.

SNIFFING LAST NIGHT...

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.705
IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY TIME
I'VE LIKED HIM.


1881
01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:41.205
GET OUTTA HERE. WHY?

1882
01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.707
I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

1883
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:45.209
THIS MACHO GUY
LIKE THAT.


1884
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.712
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
HE'D DO ANYTHING CRAZY,


1885
01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:48.713
DO YOU?

1886
01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:49.714
LIKE WHAT?

1887
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.715
I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE HURT HIMSELF?


1888
01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:53.719
NOT IF IT MEANS
MUSSING HIS HAIR.


1889
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:59.223
CAN'T WE TALK NOW?
I'M GOIN' A LITTLE CRAZY.


1890
01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.726
Dorothy: I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN I COME TO LOS ANGELES.


1891
01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.729
YOU CLOSED
THE JOINT BANK ACCOUNT.


1892
01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:04.729
YES.

1893
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.230
WHY?

1894
01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:08.232
I'LL SEND YOU
SOME MONEY.


1895
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:10.234
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER WHY?

1896
01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.736
I THOUGHT IT BEST.

1897
01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:12.737
FOR WHAT?

1898
01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:13.739
OUR SITUATION, PAUL.

1899
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.239
I HAVE TO HANG UP NOW.

1900
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.241
NO, PLEASE DON'T HANG UP.

1901
01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:20.244
JUST WHAT THE HELL
IS OUR SITUATION?


1902
01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.747
JESUS, TELL ME SOMETHING,
WILL YOU?


1903
01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.750
LOOK,
IF YOU'VE HAD AN AFFAIR,


1904
01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:27.251
THAT'S OK WITH ME.
I UNDERSTAND.


1905
01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.252
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT WE SHOULD


1906
01:23:29.253 --> 01:23:31.756
THROW THE WHOLE MARRIAGE
DOWN THE TOILET.


1907
01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:32.758
PLEASE, DOROTHY.

1908
01:23:32.759 --> 01:23:35.260
PLEASE TELL ME
WHERE I STAND.


1909
01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:40.265
I HAVE TO HAVE
MORE FREEDOM.


1910
01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.767
I WANT MORE FREEDOM.

1911
01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:45.770
DOROTHY, YOU CAN HAVE
MORE FREEDOM, HONEST.


1912
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.773
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

1913
01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:53.779
THINGS CHANGE.

1914
01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.781
I'M NOT THE SAME GIRL
I WAS IN VANCOUVER.


1915
01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:59.284
NO, YOU SURE AIN'T.

1916
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.785
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
GOT A WRITER NOW.


1917
01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:03.288
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.


1918
01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.289
I MEAN, I HAVE A HUNCH

1919
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.291
THAT YOU'RE SITTING
ON ARAM'S KNEE RIGHT NOW,


1920
01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:11.296
AND HE'S MOVING YOUR MOUTH.
HE'S PULLING THE STRINGS!


1921
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:13.164
WE'LL TALK
WHEN I COME IN.


1922
01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.634
YOU'RE LIVING
WITH HIM.


1923
01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:20.638
I'M STAYING AT HIS HOUSE
TEMPORARILY.


1924
01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:22.138
YOU'RE LIVING WITH HIM.

1925
01:24:22.139 --> 01:24:23.641
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HIM.


1926
01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.142
YOU'RE FUCKING HIM.

1927
01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.644
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
THE GUTS TO SAY IT?


1928
01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:27.646
YOU'RE DOING IT.

1929
01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:29.147
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY IT?

1930
01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:34.152
TAKE OFF
THE GODDAMN GLASSES.


1931
01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:42.661
I'M BROKE.

1932
01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:49.667
PAUL, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.


1933
01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.671
EILEEN IS HERE,
ISN'T SHE?


1934
01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:58.676
LISTEN, TOO MUCH
HAS HAPPENED ALREADY.


1935
01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:02.179
I'LL CALL YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.


1936
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.681
MAYBE WE CAN TALK THEN.

1937
01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:07.184
ABOUT A DIVORCE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?


1938
01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.187
YES.

1939
01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:11.690
I COULD CHANGE.

1940
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.192
JESUS, GIVE ME
A CHANCE, WILL YOU?


1941
01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:15.693
I'LL CALL.

1942
01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:21.198
GOD DAMN IT, HE MUST BE
HAVING YOU FOLLOWED.


1943
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.198
SON OF A BITCH.

1944
01:25:22.199 --> 01:25:24.202
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.


1945
01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:27.205
THE WHOLE THING CAN BE
HANDLED IN OTHER WAYS.


1946
01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:31.709
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T SEE HIM ANYMORE.


1947
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.210
HE SEEMED
SO SCARED.


1948
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:36.214
HEY, SIS, COME ON IN!
PLEASE?


1949
01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:39.217
DOROTHY, I WANT YOU
TO PROMISE.


1950
01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:42.720
OK, I PROMISE.

1951
01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.224
HOW'S THE WATER?

1952
01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:48.225
IT'S WARM.

1953
01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:50.728
YEAH?

1954
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.730
YOU'LL PROBABLY
HAVE TO LEAD HER A LITTLE.


1955
01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:55.233
TRY AND GET HER
TO TALK ABOUT ARAM.


1956
01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:57.235
JUICY STUFF
IF YOU CAN.


1957
01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:58.735
EVEN BETTER
YOU CAN GET HER


1958
01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:00.737
TO TALK ABOUT
THE MANAGEMENT THING.


1959
01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:02.741
SHE'S GONNA COME BACK.
I KNOW IT.


1960
01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:04.742
YEAH, SURE.

1961
01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.244
JUST IN CASE.

1962
01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:11.248
HE KEPT CHANGING
HIS FUCKING MIND.


1963
01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.249
FIRST HE SAID I COULD HAVE
SOME OF HER CLOTHES,


1964
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:15.253
AND THEN HE SAID NO,
SHE WAS COMING BACK TO HIM.


1965
01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:17.254
DIDN'T MEAN A SHIT TO ME.

1966
01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:19.256
MARKER.

1967
01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.258
DOROTHY?

1968
01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:22.260
SAM, I'M HERE.

1969
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.761
WELL, I JUST HAVE
A FEW ERRANDS TO RUN,


1970
01:26:24.762 --> 01:26:27.265
THEN I'LL BE BACK ABOUT

1971
01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.768
THAT WE'D BUY OUT
RODEO DRIVE THIS AFTERNOON.


1972
01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.270
OH, WOW! IT'S YOU!

1973
01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:34.772
YOU'RE IN THE <i>TV GUIDE.</i>

1974
01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:36.273
I'M SORRY, ARAM.

1975
01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:39.275
EILEEN'S GOING A LITTLE
BANANAS OVER SOMETHING.


1976
01:26:39.276 --> 01:26:40.778
I DIDN'T HEAR
WHAT YOU SAID.


1977
01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:42.278
I SAID I WON'T BE HOME
TILL LATE.


1978
01:26:42.279 --> 01:26:43.360
I'VE GOT TO STOP
AT THE LAB.


1979
01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.282
LOOK, IT'S YOU!

1980
01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.784
JUST A SECOND.

1981
01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:48.787
TAKE IT BACK A LITTLE.

1982
01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.790
THERE, TRY IT THERE.

1983
01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:54.793
Paul: SHE SAID,

1984
01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:56.794
"I'LL ALWAYS
TAKE CARE OF YOU."


1985
01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:59.798
YEAH. NOW, IF YOU CAN
GET HER TO REPEAT THAT...


1986
01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:00.798
OK.

1987
01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.299
PUSH THE BUTTON DOWN,

1988
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.301
WALK AROUND AND TALK.

1989
01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.804
IT'S GONNA BE
A DIFFERENT SHIRT.


1990
01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:09.306
SO?

1991
01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:11.309
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?


1992
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:13.311
ANYTHING. ANYTHING.

1993
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.814
HI, I'M
PAUL SNIDER.


1994
01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.817
PAUL SNIDER, HI.

1995
01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.321
MORE, MORE.

1996
01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.324
TESTING. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1997
01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:31.329
TESTING. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1998
01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.332
OK.

1999
01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:38.335
YOU KNOW, WE JUST NEED

2000
01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:39.837
TO STRAIGHTEN
SOME THINGS OUT.


2001
01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:42.840
ONCE WE SEE EACH OTHER,
IT'LL BE OK.


2002
01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:46.344
[STATIC]

2003
01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:47.845
DAMN.

2004
01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.847
DAMN THING
DOESN'T WORK.


2005
01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:51.347
HELL, WE
DON'T NEED IT ANYWAY.


2006
01:27:51.348 --> 01:27:52.850
ONCE WE SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER,


2007
01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:54.352
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE FINE AGAIN.


2008
01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:55.352
I KNOW IT.

2009
01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:56.854
HE CALLED ME
IN THE MORNING


2010
01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.857
AND SAID HE WAS
GOING TO SEE HER THAT DAY.


2011
01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.361
IT SAYS THURSDAY
AT 8 P.M.


2012
01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.363
CAN WE WATCH IT
TOGETHER?


2013
01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.866
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'VE GOT A DATE.


2014
01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.368
I'LL SEE YOU 2:30, OK?

2015
01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:14.872
HE STILL HAD SOME CRAZY IDEA

2016
01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:17.373
HE COULD PUT IT
ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.


2017
01:28:17.374 --> 01:28:19.877
HE VACUUMED THE RUG,
HE POLISHED THE VINYL,


2018
01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.880
HE CLEANED THE WHOLE HOUSE.

2019
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:33.390
Detective: SHE ARRIVED
A LITTLE AFTER NOON.


2020
01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:36.394
THE PLAN WAS, I WAS
TO CALL IN AN HOUR OR SO


2021
01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:38.395
TO SEE HOW IT WAS GOING.

2022
01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.898
UH, WE WORKED OUT
A LITTLE CODE


2023
01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:44.401
SO SHE WOULDN'T KNOW
HE WAS TALKING TO ME.


2024
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.904
I TRIED TO GET THROUGH
ON THE PHONE, BUT, UH...


2025
01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:50.074
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

2026
01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.580
I'VE BEEN DRINKING.

2027
01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:59.583
I'M NERVOUS.

2028
01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:02.587
I AM, TOO.

2029
01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:07.092
LOOK AT MY HAND.

2030
01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:12.096
THIS IS
A NEW SHIRT.


2031
01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.599
I MUST HAVE
COMBED MY HAIR


2032
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.102
A DOZEN TIMES.

2033
01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.105
I GUESS I HAD
SOME CRAZY IDEA


2034
01:29:20.106 --> 01:29:21.605
I COULD
WIN YOU BACK.
