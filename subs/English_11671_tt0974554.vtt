1
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.604
We're not all descended from the Puritans.

2
00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.146
- No?
- There was another colony


3
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.813
30 miles from Plymouth,
it's not on the maps today. Merry Mount.


4
00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:36.813
All right, you mentioned in your book...

5
00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.105
The colony where anything goes went.

6
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.064
- There was booze.
- There was booze, there was fornication,


7
00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.147
there was music. They even...

8
00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:46.606
You name it, you name it.

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.481
They even danced round the maypole
once a month


10
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.981
wearing masks, worshipping God knows what,

11
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.648
whites and Indians together,
all going for broke.


12
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.773
Who was responsible for all of this?

13
00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.149
A character by the name of Thomas Morton.

14
00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.357
Ah, the Hugh Hefner of the Puritans.

15
00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:05.358
You could say that, yeah.

16
00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:10.608
I'm gonna read you a quote of what
the Puritans thought of Morton's followers.


17
00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.025
"Debauched bacchanalians and atheists

18
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.025
falling into great licentiousness
and leading degenerate lives."


19
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.609
When I heard that, I packed my bags,
I left Oxford, I came straight to America,


20
00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:22.443
America the licentious.

21
00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:26.693
- So what happened to all of those people?
- Well, the Puritans shut them down.


22
00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:30.527
They sent in Myles Standish, leading the militia,
he chopped down the maypole,


23
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.735
cut down those colored ribbons,
banners, everything,


24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.819
- party was over.
- And we became a nation


25
00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:39.194
of straight-laced Puritans?

26
00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.861
- Well...
- Isn't that your point, though?


27
00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:48.695
The Puritans won,
they stamped out all things sexual...


28
00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:50.820
- How would you say?
- Sexual happiness. Happiness.


29
00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:54.362
Exactly. Until the 1960s.

30
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:58.154
Until the 1960s when it all exploded again
all over the place.


31
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.113
Right. Everyone was dancing around the maypole,

32
00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:03.446
then...

33
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.030
make love not war.

34
00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.489
If you remember, only a decade earlier,

35
00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:11.906
if you wanted to have sex,
if you wanted to make love in the 1950s,


36
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.406
you had to beg for it,
you had to cop a feel...


37
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.781
Or get married.

38
00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.156
As I did in the 1960s.

39
00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.115
Any regrets?

40
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.032
Plenty. But that's our secret.

41
00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:29.491
Don't tell anybody!

42
00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:32.033
That's just between you and me.

43
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:48.201
<i>I think it was Bette Davis who said,
"Old age is not for cissies."</i>


44
00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:55.493
<i>But it was Tolstoy who said,
"The biggest surprise in a man's life</i>


45
00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.618
<i>is old age."</i>

46
00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:02.494
<i>Old age sneaks up on you,</i>

47
00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:06.786
<i>and the next thing you know,
you're asking yourself, I'm asking myself,</i>


48
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.369
<i>"Why can't an old
man act his real age?</i>

49
00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:11.828
<i>How is it possible for me
to still be involved</i>


50
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:14.537
<i>in the carnal aspects of the human comedy?"</i>

51
00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:17.495
<i>Because, in my head,</i>

52
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.954
<i>nothing has changed.</i>

53
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.790
<i>Her name was Consuela Castillo,</i>

54
00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.956
<i>and she was my student.</i>

55
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.250
This course is called practical criticism. So...

56
00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:07.792
let's go.

57
00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:10.250
Right to the big question, shall we?

58
00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:16.251
Does War And Peace become a different book
because we read it?


59
00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:20.043
Well, yes, of course. But why?

60
00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.835
Because we bring something to the book.

61
00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.960
We bring ourselves.

62
00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:29.460
What's more, you read the
book again in ten years,

63
00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:32.877
it'll change again because you've changed.

64
00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:35.044
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

65
00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:39.211
<i>I've always been vulnerable to female beauty.</i>

66
00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:42.670
<i>Miss Castillo was different.
Her posture was perfect</i>


67
00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.837
<i>and she dress like a young associate
of a prestigious law firm.</i>


68
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:50.129
<i>There was a sophistication that set her apart.</i>

69
00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:53.879
<i>She knows she's beautiful</i>

70
00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:56.921
<i>but she's not yet sure
what to do with her beauty.</i>


71
00:04:57.006 --> 00:05:00.172
At... No, don't take notes,
because honestly, it's not worth it.


72
00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:02.880
Really, don't... don't give it a thought.

73
00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:09.131
So, a work of art reminds you
of who you are now.


74
00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:13.756
<i>Since they posted the sexual harassment
hotline number down the hall from my office,</i>


75
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.631
<i>I never make private contact
with any of my students</i>


76
00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.757
<i>until they've received their grades.</i>

77
00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.924
<i>After which, I always throw
a cocktail party for the class,</i>


78
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:25.049
<i>and it's always a success.</i>

79
00:05:27.842 --> 00:05:29.508
Want something to drink?

80
00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:35.467
Professor Kepesh,
uh, we saw you on TV last night.


81
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.592
- You were great.
- Oh, thank you.


82
00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.717
Charlie Rose was pretty good too,
wasn't he?


83
00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:42.551
Well... yes, I guess!

84
00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:45.217
- No, it was really... great.
- You're very kind. Have a lovely evening.


85
00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:46.968
Thank you.

86
00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:49.760
It's the colossus of perspective.

87
00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:51.885
It depends on who's observing,
right, Professor Kepesh?


88
00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.219
Westerners see Islamic integralists
as primitive and dangerous


89
00:05:56.303 --> 00:05:59.511
while the Islamic integralists see Americans
as depraved and corrupt.


90
00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:01.844
Nothing's changed since the Crusades.

91
00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:04.261
We need an alliance of civilizations.

92
00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:05.761
Miss Castillo.

93
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:07.553
Hi, Professor.

94
00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:10.011
- Is this a real letter from Kafka?
- Yes.


95
00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:15.345
It's one of the original letters he wrote to Milena.
It was a gift from someone.


96
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.221
Someone close to you.

97
00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.596
Someone who was close to me, 
Miss Castillo.

98
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.929
Consuela. We are not in class,
we don't need to be so formal.


99
00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:24.680
Consuela.

100
00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.222
- Do you play the piano?
- Yep.


101
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.347
- Would you play for us?
- Too many people. I'd freeze.


102
00:06:37.807 --> 00:06:41.973
You know there's something about you
that invites a kind of formality.


103
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.348
What do you mean?

104
00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:47.807
You have a kind of elegant austerity.

105
00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:52.682
- Austerity?
- Something like that.


106
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.516
Well, I guess I
got that from my father.

107
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.558
He is austere, and proud.

108
00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:02.475
- Very Cuban.
- He's Cuban?


109
00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:06.809
My whole family is Cuban.
I was eleven years old when I came.


110
00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.809
Did you go straight to college
from high school?


111
00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:13.226
No. I was a legal
secretary in a law firm.

112
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.310
- You were?
- I tried it but I didn't like it.


113
00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:21.310
And my parents always hoped
I would go to college, so...


114
00:07:22.103 --> 00:07:24.519
I made up my
mind and here I am.

115
00:07:28.645 --> 00:07:30.894
May I show you something?

116
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.186
- Here we are.
- Goya.


117
00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.687
- What's this one called?
- La Maja Vestida.


118
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.020
And?

119
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.187
- And?
- She resembles you.


120
00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:50.146
You resemble her.

121
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:53.855
Really?

122
00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:58.647
I think so.

123
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.314
- What do you think?
- I don't know.


124
00:08:08.774 --> 00:08:11.231
The eyes, maybe.

125
00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:18.482
<i>Why all this talk about Kafka, Goya,
and her Cuban family?</i>


126
00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:22.566
<i>Don't get me wrong, it's great that her family's Cuban
and she enjoys my class</i>


127
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.024
<i>but I go on yakking away
mainly because I want to fuck her.</i>


128
00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:28.358
- What can I say?
- The truth.


129
00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:30.108
That the room is full of spies?

130
00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:42.401
I... I do love opera,
my grandfather takes me to the opera,


131
00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:44.401
and I adore the theatre.

132
00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:49.402
I review plays for a magazine.
Would you like to go with me sometime?


133
00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:51.443
To the theatre.

134
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:55.152
- Yes.
- Sorry.


135
00:08:57.903 --> 00:09:01.569
Go to the theatre?
Why don't you take her to the prom?


136
00:09:01.654 --> 00:09:05.195
No, you don't get it. 
This girl is...

137
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.070
She's a throwback to a completely different time.

138
00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.820
She has to be wooed.

139
00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:12.237
I thought we were talking about sex, I...

140
00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:14.612
You know, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet,

141
00:09:14.697 --> 00:09:17.613
sometimes you display
a remarkable lack of imagination.


142
00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:20.238
That's why they gave me the fucking prize.

143
00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:25.072
Don't tell me you've never been through the process,
talking the talk?


144
00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:27.530
That's why I have
a family, for Christ's sake.

145
00:09:27.615 --> 00:09:30.114
I talk to them.
Maybe you should get married again.


146
00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:31.489
George!

147
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.281
Bifurcate your requirements.

148
00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:39.073
You'll talk the talk with your wife,
if you feel like it.


149
00:09:39.157 --> 00:09:42.615
Go to the museums,
look at all the Goyas that you want,


150
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:45.532
but keep the sex part just for sex.

151
00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:48.782
All right.

152
00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:54.074
Do you really still
talk to your wife, George?

153
00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:56.908
Ohh... One-all.

154
00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:03.867
I'm not hitting that.

155
00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:06.081
Oh, sneaking off for a smoke!

156
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.623
You know you shouldn't smoke.

157
00:11:09.708 --> 00:11:13.082
You tell me that in this bed
every three weeks.


158
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.915
I'm under a lot of pressure.

159
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.082
- I like to be consistent.
- Mm, so do I.


160
00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:23.249
David, you've tried to get me
to quit smoking for 20 years.


161
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:25.750
Since the first day of your class.

162
00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:28.583
Oh, my God, your class made me smoke.

163
00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:34.876
I'm under a lot of stress.

164
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.001
- Oh, how was Chicago?
- Cleveland.


165
00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:39.751
- Er...
- Chicago was last week. Atlanta...


166
00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:43.460
- Atlanta is next week.
- You sound like Cary Grant


167
00:11:43.544 --> 00:11:45.418
in North By Northwest.

168
00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:50.544
Laugh.

169
00:11:50.628 --> 00:11:52.669
Just try being a woman
running your own business.


170
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.836
- I thought you liked being your own boss.
- I do. Oh, I do, I do.


171
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.378
I do.

172
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.462
But thank God for these little interludes,

173
00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:03.920
that's all I can say.

174
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:17.630
Aren't you gonna get that?

175
00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:20.838
Only one person in the world would call me
at two o'clock in the morning.


176
00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:23.922
<i>Leave a message.</i>

177
00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:27.381
<i>Did you get my email?
I really need to talk to you.</i>


178
00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:29.089
<i>Uh...</i>

179
00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:32.089
<i>- I should have known better...
- Kenny.</i>


180
00:12:32.174 --> 00:12:34.131
<i>than to think you'd
be home at this hour.</i>

181
00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:39.132
<i>Or maybe you are home and you're listening
to this all snug and smug</i>


182
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.799
<i>and curled up.</i>

183
00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:43.340
35 years old, he still hates my guts.

184
00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:45.549
Well, you ran out on him.

185
00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.508
I ran out on a marriage that I got myself into
out of youth and fear a million years ago.


186
00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:52.758
- That's the price you pay for liberation.
- No, that's the price he pays


187
00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:57.383
for being turned into the heroic defender
of the abandoned mother.


188
00:12:57.468 --> 00:13:00.509
I mean, there's only one of us
could make it over the wall,


189
00:13:00.593 --> 00:13:01.800
he's still on my case.

190
00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:03.926
I mean, isn't there some statute of limitations?

191
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.551
I've tried. Really, I've tried.

192
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.551
When he was 12 or 13 one time,

193
00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:12.885
he came to spend the summer with me,
I took him to the Mets,


194
00:13:12.969 --> 00:13:15.218
he spent the next five innings
throwing up in the men's room.


195
00:13:15.303 --> 00:13:17.677
He's been throwing up ever since,
that phone call was him throwing up.


196
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:19.636
And you know what's wild?

197
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.594
He's successful. Kenny Kepesh.

198
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.386
Well-respected doctor, my son the doctor.

199
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:30.095
He speaks passable French,
he's married with children.


200
00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.804
It's only with me that he regresses
to what you just heard.


201
00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:37.221
I'm sorry, he gets me going.

202
00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.513
I thought you stopped reviewing plays.

203
00:13:45.597 --> 00:13:48.263
Well, that one looked kind of interesting.

204
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.597
- Too bad I'm gonna be in Atlanta.
- I'll go with George.


205
00:13:55.807 --> 00:14:00.181
Religion, family, church, self-help books,

206
00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:04.598
men with teeth so white you think
there's a flashlight in their mouths.


207
00:14:04.682 --> 00:14:09.057
- Love! Especially romantic love!
- Love!


208
00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:12.641
Flowers, mini-malls.

209
00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:15.516
There's nothing more depressing than mini-malls.

210
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.808
- What do you think?
- Mini-malls!


211
00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:21.933
Except perhaps your flaws, your vices,

212
00:14:22.017 --> 00:14:24.725
your mortgages, your...

213
00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:27.892
furtive looks to your sleeping BlackBerrys.

214
00:14:27.976 --> 00:14:29.100
BlackBerrys!

215
00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:35.601
And this man who finds himself here,
dandruff falling off my head...


216
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:39.143
That was wonderful.

217
00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:43.018
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Thank you.


218
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:48.686
Would you like to
go somewhere for a drink?

219
00:14:51.937 --> 00:14:53.936
We don't have to.

220
00:14:56.854 --> 00:15:00.895
I'm just not used to
being out with a celebrity.

221
00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:03.812
Talking about literature
on public television once a week


222
00:15:03.896 --> 00:15:06.521
and writing the occasional review
for the New Yorker,


223
00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.646
doesn't make me much of a celebrity.

224
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.146
Mm, don't forget your risqué books.

225
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.855
The origins of American hedonism.

226
00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:17.772
Look, if you don't like the idea
of being stared at,


227
00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:20.230
we could go to my place,

228
00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:23.314
then the only person staring will be me.

229
00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:35.315
If I go to your place,
will you do something for me?


230
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.029
That was awful.

231
00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:36.404
That was OK.

232
00:16:36.489 --> 00:16:40.238
That was amazing.
I wish I could play.


233
00:16:41.364 --> 00:16:44.280
Take lessons. You'd enjoy playing.

234
00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:47.864
If you knew more, you wouldn't have
such a high opinion of my playing.


235
00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:50.322
Now you're fishing for compliments.

236
00:16:50.407 --> 00:16:52.406
Is this a metronome?

237
00:16:53.073 --> 00:16:55.448
It's like a heartbeat.

238
00:16:55.532 --> 00:17:01.490
Even great pianists have a problem
that they call acceleration.


239
00:17:08.492 --> 00:17:10.699
You are a very charming man.

240
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.033
You know that, don't you?

241
00:17:16.117 --> 00:17:19.992
If this all for showing you a metronome,
I swear I didn't invent it.


242
00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:55.953
<i>Can you find anyone
that enchanting without sex?</i>


243
00:17:58.038 --> 00:17:59.704
<i>Nobody.</i>

244
00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:05.496
What is this?

245
00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:09.121
It's my darkroom.

246
00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:13.705
I used to develop my own pictures.

247
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:16.164
- So you don't anymore?
- No, no time.


248
00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:22.123
I should go digital but I can't really
understand that stuff.


249
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.873
Of course you can.

250
00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:29.373
Thank you.

251
00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:40.916
Something for this little princess
because she's...


252
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.750
she's the centre of the picture,
not her parents.


253
00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:47.458
The queen and the king, they're...

254
00:18:49.001 --> 00:18:50.459
just...

255
00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:53.417
ghostly reflections in the mirror.

256
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:23.259
Well, she must have been curious
about going to bed with you.


257
00:20:23.968 --> 00:20:28.301
Yeah, so she could tell her girlfriends
what a man of our age, uh,


258
00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.343
is like close-up.

259
00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:33.718
I'm a new experience for her.
One of many to come.


260
00:20:34.886 --> 00:20:40.427
She'll remember me as the old guy
who gave her some culture on the way.


261
00:20:41.178 --> 00:20:45.344
Well, that sounds about right,
and you should chalk it up to the same thing, right?


262
00:20:46.887 --> 00:20:48.470
Yeah...

263
00:20:49.638 --> 00:20:51.928
gotta stop worrying about growing old.

264
00:20:53.388 --> 00:20:55.470
Worry about growing up.

265
00:20:58.013 --> 00:21:03.554
Oh, thank your lucky stars
for such a one-shot encounter.


266
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.680
It wasn't a one-shot encounter.

267
00:21:08.889 --> 00:21:10.972
She came back for more?

268
00:21:55.394 --> 00:21:58.435
You have the most beautiful breasts
I've ever seen.


269
00:22:02.478 --> 00:22:04.352
You like them?

270
00:22:05.853 --> 00:22:07.811
I worship them.

271
00:22:16.812 --> 00:22:18.895
And you have a beautiful face...

272
00:22:20.938 --> 00:22:23.020
that I can't stop looking at.

273
00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:26.729
You know something?

274
00:22:30.314 --> 00:22:32.271
You're a work of art.

275
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.563
A work of art.

276
00:22:44.857 --> 00:22:46.939
A real work of art.

277
00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:08.108
Let's talk about you.

278
00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:13.692
- Have you had many women?
- Why?


279
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.692
More than 50, or less?

280
00:23:20.652 --> 00:23:22.734
More?

281
00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.651
Who's counting?

282
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:29.318
How about you?

283
00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:32.069
Not many.

284
00:23:32.153 --> 00:23:33.735
How many?

285
00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:45.778
Cincuenta y seis, cincuenta y siete,
cincuenta y ocho...


286
00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:51.904
Five.

287
00:23:53.113 --> 00:23:55.196
Five boyfriends.

288
00:23:56.155 --> 00:23:58.654
- Five.
- Five.


289
00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:04.488
I see.

290
00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:11.322
So who were they? They were...
They were young, right? Younger than me.


291
00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:13.947
Of course they were younger.

292
00:24:14.032 --> 00:24:15.948
They were boys.

293
00:24:16.032 --> 00:24:17.489
Boys.

294
00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:19.656
Sure.

295
00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:30.491
You wanna know the most
extreme thing I ever did?

296
00:24:30.575 --> 00:24:32.324
Mm, what?

297
00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:36.158
Once I went to
bed with two guys together.

298
00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:40.492
Two together?

299
00:24:40.576 --> 00:24:43.075
They were my childhood friends, and...

300
00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:47.117
and that's how it ended up one night.

301
00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:50.534
The three of us were drunk
and we ended up in bed together.


302
00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:54.993
All three of you?

303
00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:58.785
But when you're 17, you know,

304
00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:02.910
you do a lot of things
just to feel like you're moving.


305
00:25:02.995 --> 00:25:04.536
Right.

306
00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:57.999
<i>Consuela.</i>

307
00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:01.374
<i>My whole life was dedicated to independence,</i>

308
00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:04.041
<i>and at some cost
I had achieved my goal.</i>

309
00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:07.750
<i>Nevertheless, it was in that moment...</i>

310
00:26:09.168 --> 00:26:11.250
<i>that my terrible jealousy was born.</i>

311
00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:15.417
<i>That is when I realized
that I would never, ever,</i>


312
00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:17.584
<i>really possess her.</i>

313
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.960
<i>I feel anxious unless I speak to her
on the phone every day</i>


314
00:26:22.044 --> 00:26:24.085
<i>and then I feel anxious after we've spoken.</i>

315
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:26.710
I finished early. 
It went really well.

316
00:26:26.794 --> 00:26:28.877
What are you wearing?

317
00:26:29.628 --> 00:26:31.419
Where are you?

318
00:26:36.504 --> 00:26:41.003
<i>I knew it's only a matter of time
before a young man found her and took her away.</i>


319
00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:47.295
<i>I knew,</i>

320
00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.337
<i>because I was once that young man
who would have done it.</i>


321
00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:19.965
Well, at least does
it make you feel young?

322
00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:22.215
It's like playing soccer
with a bunch of 20-year-olds.


323
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.549
It doesn't make you feel 20
because you're playing with them.


324
00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:28.674
You notice the difference
every second of the game.


325
00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:32.716
You have to leave her.
Your hands will always be tied by this girl.


326
00:27:32.801 --> 00:27:35.883
She's gonna leave you sooner or later anyway,

327
00:27:35.968 --> 00:27:38.550
so it's always better
to keep one step ahead.

328
00:27:40.218 --> 00:27:43.051
Take her to a nice romantic spot.

329
00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:45.176
Tell her it's over.

330
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.343
That's what I'd do.

331
00:27:51.802 --> 00:27:56.052
My parents talk about all these places
they wanted to go to, and...


332
00:27:56.136 --> 00:27:59.761
they have all the money
to go wherever they want to, but...


333
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.219
leaving Cuba was their first and last trip.

334
00:28:06.012 --> 00:28:08.053
I don't want my
life to be like that.

335
00:28:08.137 --> 00:28:10.262
Let me take you places.

336
00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:12.845
<i>What the hell are you saying?
You brought her here to say goodbye.</i>


337
00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:14.970
- Where would we go?
- Europe.


338
00:28:15.055 --> 00:28:19.512
We could go to Paris this summer,
or Rome, or Madrid.


339
00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:23.804
We could visit Il Prado and see
the real Velázquez, the real Goya.


340
00:28:23.889 --> 00:28:25.471
<i>Il Prado?</i>

341
00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:28.555
Do you mean it?

342
00:28:29.473 --> 00:28:31.389
Course I mean it.

343
00:28:31.473 --> 00:28:35.389
And we could finish our trip in Venice.
You'd love Venice.


344
00:28:35.473 --> 00:28:37.056
Venezia.

345
00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.973
And you would ride a gondola with me.

346
00:28:41.057 --> 00:28:42.723
Maybe.

347
00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:45.015
"Maybe."

348
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.515
Maybe, maybe, your favorite word.

349
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.182
I'll sing to you in a gondola.

350
00:28:57.184 --> 00:28:58.558
We'll see.

351
00:29:03.018 --> 00:29:04.600
Venezia.

352
00:29:05.393 --> 00:29:07.392
Venezia!

353
00:29:10.518 --> 00:29:13.351
What's this from,
"They are making the beast with two backs"?


354
00:29:13.435 --> 00:29:15.101
What's that from?

355
00:29:15.185 --> 00:29:16.726
William Shakespeare!

356
00:29:16.811 --> 00:29:18.851
Othello, the Moor of Venice.

357
00:29:18.936 --> 00:29:21.560
And we're making the monster with four legs.

358
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.727
- Where shall we have dinner?
- I can't, I'm going out tonight.


359
00:29:28.812 --> 00:29:30.811
- You are? With whom?
- With my brother.


360
00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:33.978
We're gonna go dancing to that place, Kalimas.

361
00:29:34.062 --> 00:29:36.145
Your brother?

362
00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:40.020
You never mentioned a brother.

363
00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:44.145
Well, there is a lot of things
you don't know about me yet.


364
00:29:52.022 --> 00:29:53.480
Thank you.

365
00:30:00.273 --> 00:30:01.939
Here we are.

366
00:30:04.565 --> 00:30:07.606
I really had a
great time with you today.

367
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.356
Me too.

368
00:30:16.358 --> 00:30:18.024
Thank you.

369
00:30:26.234 --> 00:30:28.608
Bye.

370
00:30:30.192 --> 00:30:31.650
Bye.

371
00:30:40.068 --> 00:30:42.526
Are you really going out
with your brother tonight?


372
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.318
David.

373
00:30:45.402 --> 00:30:47.276
That was a joke.

374
00:30:48.278 --> 00:30:49.943
Bye.

375
00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:11.362
<i>On the nights she isn't with me,
I am deformed...</i>


376
00:31:12.863 --> 00:31:14.946
<i>thinking of where she might be.</i>

377
00:31:17.447 --> 00:31:20.405
<i>And all this because this girl
who will tell me a thousand times</i>


378
00:31:20.489 --> 00:31:23.363
<i>how much she adores me, and mean it...</i>

379
00:31:25.364 --> 00:31:29.197
<i>this girl will never once tell me
she yearns for my cock.</i>


380
00:31:48.783 --> 00:31:50.741
Calm down.

381
00:32:50.122 --> 00:32:52.163
How are you?

382
00:32:52.248 --> 00:32:53.872
What are you doing here?

383
00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:56.664
I was on my
way to see a friend

384
00:32:56.748 --> 00:32:58.831
who lives near here.

385
00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:00.872
How's things?

386
00:33:00.957 --> 00:33:03.164
What's the matter?

387
00:33:03.249 --> 00:33:06.081
- Did you come here to check on me?
- I told you.


388
00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:09.040
I was down in the neighborhood
and I saw this place.


389
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:13.082
Do you want to ruin everything?

390
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.499
No.

391
00:33:16.583 --> 00:33:19.791
So then you're gonna have
to start trusting me.


392
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.208
I'll call you tomorrow.

393
00:33:25.292 --> 00:33:27.542
No. I'll call you.

394
00:33:51.878 --> 00:33:55.628
I never behaved like such an idiot
even when I was her age.


395
00:33:55.712 --> 00:33:58.836
You know, the good thing is,
at least now it's finished.


396
00:33:58.921 --> 00:34:01.420
She won't want to see me anymore.
I'm not...


397
00:34:01.504 --> 00:34:05.087
I understand her. I mean, even I wouldn't want
to see me any more if I were her.


398
00:34:07.588 --> 00:34:10.421
- Yes, it's just as well. Just as well.
- Well, I...


399
00:34:10.505 --> 00:34:12.254
Just as well.

400
00:34:14.422 --> 00:34:15.588
Oh, man.

401
00:34:33.466 --> 00:34:35.881
<i>- Hello?
- David, it's Consuela.</i>


402
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:46.257
During the last two days
I've been thinking a bit about us.


403
00:34:46.342 --> 00:34:48.008
Have you?

404
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.216
Yes.

405
00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:54.466
What were you thinking?

406
00:34:58.301 --> 00:35:00.009
<i>That it's all over.</i>

407
00:35:00.093 --> 00:35:02.217
What do you really want from me?

408
00:35:03.093 --> 00:35:05.259
What do I really want from you?

409
00:35:07.927 --> 00:35:13.802
You spend your whole life going through
relationships without ever really...


410
00:35:13.886 --> 00:35:16.052
bonding with anyone, so...

411
00:35:18.678 --> 00:35:21.261
at least I would like to know
who I am for you.


412
00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:32.887
The fact that you are jealous
and possessive doesn't help me at all.


413
00:35:34.638 --> 00:35:38.262
Even little kids are jealous of their toys
until they get tired of them


414
00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:40.763
and want new ones, so...

415
00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:43.346
is that how it's
gonna be between us two?

416
00:35:50.973 --> 00:35:53.055
Have you ever imagined...

417
00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:59.014
a future with me?

418
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:04.431
A future with you scares me.

419
00:36:06.766 --> 00:36:09.015
- It scares you?
- Yes.


420
00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:12.432
Why?

421
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:23.475
Because...

422
00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:29.851
there's a 30-odd-year age difference
between you and me, and...


423
00:36:29.935 --> 00:36:32.392
you have your whole
life ahead of you, and...

424
00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:36.768
it's just a matter of time
before you realize it too.


425
00:36:36.852 --> 00:36:41.227
I didn't ask you what I was gonna do.
I asked you what you wanted to do with me.


426
00:36:54.729 --> 00:36:56.853
<i>When you make love to
a woman you get revenge</i>

427
00:36:56.937 --> 00:36:59.395
<i>for all the things
that defeated you in life.</i>

428
00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:49.691
<i>I spent my whole life jumping
from one relationship to another</i>


429
00:37:49.776 --> 00:37:52.275
<i>because this made me believe
that I was never alone</i>


430
00:37:52.359 --> 00:37:54.442
<i>and that time was not passing.</i>

431
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:05.318
I've always surmised, for example,
that D.H. Lawrence,


432
00:38:05.402 --> 00:38:09.485
when he was writing Lady Chatterley's Lover...

433
00:38:09.569 --> 00:38:12.069
<i>"Who am I for you?"
she asked me one day.</i>


434
00:38:12.153 --> 00:38:14.860
<i>I was too afraid to
ask who I was for her.</i>

435
00:38:19.237 --> 00:38:21.319
<i>How long could it have lasted?</i>

436
00:38:33.113 --> 00:38:34.779
Surprise.

437
00:38:39.739 --> 00:38:41.571
- I'm...
- You OK?


438
00:38:41.656 --> 00:38:43.196
Yeah.

439
00:38:43.281 --> 00:38:45.197
Let me...
Wow!


440
00:38:49.323 --> 00:38:51.322
<i>Thank God for Caroline.</i>

441
00:38:57.782 --> 00:39:01.907
<i>Loneliness comes to call</i>

442
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:08.491
<i>And sometimes the sun
doesn't shine for us all</i>


443
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.116
<i>Always remember when twilight descends</i>

444
00:39:15.201 --> 00:39:19.075
<i>Loneliness ends with love</i>

445
00:39:20.493 --> 00:39:24.867
<i>Love needs a place to start</i>

446
00:39:24.951 --> 00:39:26.451
<i>And who knows...</i>

447
00:39:26.535 --> 00:39:31.201
<i>Caroline is my only point of contact
with the self-confident man I used to be.</i>


448
00:39:32.077 --> 00:39:37.868
<i>Don't be afraid of
the moon that is sent</i>

449
00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:41.119
<i>Loneliness ends with love</i>

450
00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:45.577
How was that play?

451
00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:48.078
Which play?

452
00:39:48.912 --> 00:39:51.328
The one you took George to.

453
00:39:51.412 --> 00:39:53.787
Oh, unremarkable. Just...

454
00:40:00.246 --> 00:40:03.204
- Here I go.
- Oh, hit and run.


455
00:40:03.288 --> 00:40:07.079
- Mm, just the way we like it.
- Good thing you don't have pets.


456
00:40:08.497 --> 00:40:10.080
Only you.

457
00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:28.498
Which one was Carlos Alonso?

458
00:40:30.083 --> 00:40:32.207
- From high school.
- What was his thing?


459
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.374
What did he want you to do?

460
00:40:42.084 --> 00:40:44.583
He liked to watch me menstruate.

461
00:40:49.334 --> 00:40:50.792
What?

462
00:40:50.876 --> 00:40:53.542
- He liked to watch me menstruate.
- I don't believe this.


463
00:40:53.627 --> 00:40:55.667
The respectable Cuban
-American girl,

464
00:40:55.752 --> 00:40:57.793
whose parents worship Ronald Reagan,

465
00:40:57.877 --> 00:41:01.793
who enforce an eight o'clock curfew
on their daughter, in summertime no less,


466
00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:04.627
and there she is
in high school, age 15...

467
00:41:04.711 --> 00:41:07.210
- 16, 16.
- Oh, I'm so sorry!


468
00:41:07.295 --> 00:41:09.377
That makes all the difference!

469
00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:12.669
I think you're being ridiculous.

470
00:41:12.753 --> 00:41:15.378
- How did you manage it?
- David.


471
00:41:15.462 --> 00:41:17.836
I'm really curious. 
What did you do?

472
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:21.295
You find yourself having your period,
you pick up the phone, ask him to come over.


473
00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:22.962
"Hey, Carlos, I'm starting."

474
00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:25.879
And then he appears,
all Cuban and respectable,


475
00:41:25.963 --> 00:41:28.004
and the pair of
you retire to the bathroom

476
00:41:28.088 --> 00:41:31.629
where you have the ceremony
of the pulling down of the tampon.


477
00:41:31.713 --> 00:41:34.296
Yeah. You sound like you were there.

478
00:41:36.922 --> 00:41:39.255
Just filling in the missing...

479
00:41:40.381 --> 00:41:43.089
Just filling in the blanks.

480
00:41:43.173 --> 00:41:44.672
Which blanks?

481
00:41:44.756 --> 00:41:47.131
Five. Now we're down to three

482
00:41:47.215 --> 00:41:49.506
because of the two guys who you...

483
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.923
I have to go. Sorry.

484
00:41:58.258 --> 00:41:59.923
What is this?

485
00:42:00.008 --> 00:42:02.090
- What?
- This.


486
00:42:05.175 --> 00:42:07.257
You're fucking other women.

487
00:42:08.384 --> 00:42:11.133
I had two husbands who fucked other women.

488
00:42:11.217 --> 00:42:15.342
I didn't like it then, I don't like it now,
least of all with you.


489
00:42:15.426 --> 00:42:17.633
You have everything with me, David.

490
00:42:17.718 --> 00:42:19.634
Pure fucking.

491
00:42:19.718 --> 00:42:22.676
No... No hidden agendas,
no icky entanglements.


492
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.343
How could you do this?
There aren't many like me.


493
00:42:27.927 --> 00:42:32.010
I actually understand you.
I am one in a million.


494
00:42:32.094 --> 00:42:35.510
- How could you possibly...
- I don't know whose that is.


495
00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:37.969
Why don't you put it on your bagel
and eat it?


496
00:42:38.053 --> 00:42:42.386
- But I have a pretty good idea.
- I'm sure you do.


497
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.594
You know my friend George O'
Hearn, the poet?

498
00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:47.720
George uses tampons? Since when?

499
00:42:47.804 --> 00:42:52.553
No, no, listen. George...
has the keys to this apartment.


500
00:42:52.638 --> 00:42:54.470
He gives poetry readings, he meets girls,

501
00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:57.262
he can't bring them home to his wife
in New Rochelle, and...


502
00:42:57.347 --> 00:43:00.929
and since he's always short on funds
and since some of them are married...


503
00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:02.888
George fucks all these women in your bed?

504
00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:05.638
- Not all. Some. He uses the bed in the guest room.
- Oh, my God.


505
00:43:05.722 --> 00:43:08.138
His marriage isn't paradise,
probably a bit like mine,


506
00:43:08.223 --> 00:43:10.430
only he wasn't desperate enough to get out.
Caroline...


507
00:43:10.515 --> 00:43:13.764
I don't believe a fucking word
you're saying, David.


508
00:43:13.848 --> 00:43:17.347
Everything in your life is so meticulous,
it's so orderly...


509
00:43:17.432 --> 00:43:19.514
I don't know whose tampon this is.

510
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:24.098
You have to believe me.

511
00:43:25.683 --> 00:43:27.765
You're all I'm holding on to.

512
00:43:29.475 --> 00:43:32.099
<i>In this at least
I was telling the truth.</i>

513
00:43:57.602 --> 00:44:00.393
<i>Of course,
the whole situation was ridiculous.</i>


514
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.479
Oh...

515
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.063
Do I snore?

516
00:44:30.897 --> 00:44:32.021
Do I?

517
00:44:32.106 --> 00:44:34.146
It's worse.

518
00:44:35.189 --> 00:44:36.897
What?

519
00:44:36.981 --> 00:44:39.522
Well, you drool.

520
00:44:40.315 --> 00:44:42.147
Yes.

521
00:44:42.232 --> 00:44:44.856
- You drool in... You drool in your sleep.
- No, I don't.


522
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.356
Beautiful women are invisible.

523
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.565
Invisible? What the hell does that mean?

524
00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.024
Invisible? They jump out at you.

525
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:09.941
A beautiful woman, she stands out,
she stands apart. You can't miss her.


526
00:45:10.026 --> 00:45:12.483
But we never actually see the person.

527
00:45:12.568 --> 00:45:16.775
We see the beautiful shell.
We're blocked by the beauty barrier.


528
00:45:20.027 --> 00:45:22.109
Look at you.

529
00:45:34.945 --> 00:45:36.402
What?

530
00:45:37.153 --> 00:45:39.236
What did you say?

531
00:45:42.154 --> 00:45:45.486
- You're deaf, Mr. Kepesh.
- No. What?


532
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.653
Or maybe you don't want to hear.

533
00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:50.654
Maybe that's the problem with you.

534
00:46:04.989 --> 00:46:09.364
Yeah. We're so dazzled by the outside
that we never make it inside.


535
00:46:19.699 --> 00:46:22.365
Do you always work in black-and-white?

536
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:24.073
Mainly.

537
00:46:24.158 --> 00:46:26.532
I like the theatricality.

538
00:46:27.408 --> 00:46:30.116
Is that how you see the world?

539
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.449
Black and white? No.

540
00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:37.033
That distinction belongs to my son.

541
00:46:39.159 --> 00:46:41.992
You always speak of him with such bitterness.

542
00:46:43.368 --> 00:46:46.201
In my family that would be so strange.

543
00:46:47.285 --> 00:46:49.034
Take a look.

544
00:46:55.327 --> 00:46:57.410
Beautiful picture.

545
00:46:58.369 --> 00:47:00.452
Beautiful woman.

546
00:47:01.245 --> 00:47:03.327
Look, my hands are huge.

547
00:47:05.495 --> 00:47:07.578
I want you so much.

548
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:14.828
David.

549
00:47:16.329 --> 00:47:18.412
Your fridge is empty, so...

550
00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:21.954
if we are staying in...

551
00:47:23.497 --> 00:47:25.579
we have to go shopping.

552
00:47:26.955 --> 00:47:29.455
Hace un dia precioso.

553
00:47:29.539 --> 00:47:32.622
Excuse me, Professor,
but your Spanish is awful.


554
00:47:32.706 --> 00:47:35.580
- Will you teach me?
- Yeah, I'll teach you.


555
00:47:35.665 --> 00:47:37.872
I'll teach you mañana.

556
00:47:37.957 --> 00:47:39.622
Mañana?

557
00:47:42.874 --> 00:47:44.914
Isn’t that your poet friend?

558
00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:47.081
Keep walking.

559
00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:53.915
- That woman's not his wife?
- That's right.


560
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.249
- I find that disgusting.
- But it isn't our business.


561
00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:02.166
- And that's the end of it?
- Well, let's not discuss it here.


562
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.750
- Are you OK with that?
- Of course.


563
00:48:06.376 --> 00:48:09.500
For all you know, he's just having
a cup of coffee with a friend.


564
00:48:09.585 --> 00:48:11.500
You're jumping to conclusions.

565
00:48:11.585 --> 00:48:16.042
David, being younger than you
doesn't make me a child.


566
00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:19.376
In any event, it's not our business.

567
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.293
You keep saying that,
but what do you think about it?


568
00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:26.502
What I think is...

569
00:48:26.586 --> 00:48:28.835
that marriage...

570
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.211
is a problematic institution at best.

571
00:48:32.253 --> 00:48:34.461
Which is why you have no wife.

572
00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:36.836
Which is why I don't cheat on one.

573
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.878
- But you were married once.
- Yes, yes, yes!


574
00:48:39.962 --> 00:48:42.503
Yes! Yes!

575
00:48:42.588 --> 00:48:44.753
Yes! What do you want me to say?

576
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:48.504
I was married. 
It was a mistake.

577
00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.713
Did you try? Did you really try?

578
00:48:54.047 --> 00:48:56.296
- Where I come from...
- I know, I know.


579
00:48:56.381 --> 00:49:00.005
Where you come from the rules are different,
but they're not.


580
00:49:04.756 --> 00:49:07.964
- You're such a cynic.
- I'm such a realist.


581
00:49:09.924 --> 00:49:12.131
I think you're just infantile.

582
00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.298
I'm sure you're right.

583
00:49:23.883 --> 00:49:26.966
<i>I hung in there for over a year.
It was a real roller-coaster ride</i>


584
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:29.841
<i>and like all rides sooner or later
it has to end.</i>


585
00:49:39.926 --> 00:49:41.926
What are you doing a week from Sunday?

586
00:49:42.885 --> 00:49:44.426
I don't know. Why?

587
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:48.551
- Something to drink?
- Yeah, uh, two bellinis, please.


588
00:49:48.636 --> 00:49:49.801
OK.

589
00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:52.385
What's a week from Sunday?

590
00:49:52.469 --> 00:49:55.260
My parents are throwing me a graduation party

591
00:49:55.345 --> 00:49:57.510
to celebrate my MFA.

592
00:49:58.678 --> 00:50:00.761
I'd like you to come.

593
00:50:03.387 --> 00:50:05.678
David, everyone knows about you.

594
00:50:05.762 --> 00:50:07.803
For a whole year and a half
they've been asking me


595
00:50:07.887 --> 00:50:10.095
about this mystery man I'm seeing.

596
00:50:11.513 --> 00:50:15.970
They're gonna start thinking I'm with
some drug dealer if you don't stop hiding.


597
00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:17.721
I'm not hiding.

598
00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:20.763
Well, you didn't come to my birthday.

599
00:50:20.847 --> 00:50:22.346
Well, you didn't ask me.

600
00:50:23.472 --> 00:50:27.263
I asked you to Christmas dinner with my parents.
You had plans.


601
00:50:27.348 --> 00:50:30.722
Then I invited you to Thanksgiving dinner,
you couldn't come.


602
00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:33.097
Well, Thanksgiving I really couldn't.

603
00:50:48.266 --> 00:50:50.932
- David.
- What?


604
00:50:51.016 --> 00:50:53.932
I want you to meet my family...

605
00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.058
and I'm not going to insist,

606
00:50:56.142 --> 00:50:58.724
I just want you to say yes
because you want to come.


607
00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:05.100
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thanks.


608
00:51:08.393 --> 00:51:10.601
Listen to me.

609
00:51:11.685 --> 00:51:14.059
Listen to me.

610
00:51:18.727 --> 00:51:20.810
When I come to your party,

611
00:51:21.894 --> 00:51:23.977
you have to promise to do something.

612
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.436
What?

613
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.270
Don't take your eyes off me...

614
00:51:34.354 --> 00:51:39.562
when the Cuban aunties
come stampeding towards me.


615
00:51:43.438 --> 00:51:44.896
That's all?

616
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.729
That's all.

617
00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:50.521
OK.

618
00:51:50.605 --> 00:51:53.688
So... that means yes?

619
00:51:53.772 --> 00:51:55.855
That means yes.

620
00:51:57.273 --> 00:51:58.939
OK.

621
00:52:15.274 --> 00:52:16.940
I'm happy.

622
00:52:18.608 --> 00:52:19.649
Good.

623
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.357
And now the food.

624
00:52:26.484 --> 00:52:32.150
Her parents will be there,
her grandparents will be there.


625
00:52:32.234 --> 00:52:34.317
Cuban relatives, all her childhood friends,

626
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:36.859
and who knows, Carlos Alonso

627
00:52:36.943 --> 00:52:40.942
and the two guys who made her
the meat of their sandwich.


628
00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:45.110
And I'll be introduced as
"the teacher who's on television".


629
00:52:46.444 --> 00:52:47.568
What's wrong with that?

630
00:52:47.653 --> 00:52:50.402
What's wrong is I'll be judged for my age.
They'll say all the...


631
00:52:50.486 --> 00:52:52.902
horrible things they say in these cases,
that I'm...


632
00:52:52.986 --> 00:52:55.027
she's with me because she wants
something in return


633
00:52:55.112 --> 00:52:57.277
and I'm with her
because I like young girls.

634
00:52:57.362 --> 00:53:00.236
It's pathetic.

635
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.778
It's about time to face your situation,
that's what I think.


636
00:53:09.405 --> 00:53:11.487
Who is Carlos Alonso?

637
00:53:13.113 --> 00:53:14.904
Some guy.

638
00:53:21.864 --> 00:53:23.363
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>


639
00:53:23.448 --> 00:53:25.863
<i>- Did I wake you up?
- No, I was reading.</i>


640
00:53:28.406 --> 00:53:30.531
I just wanted to say good night

641
00:53:30.615 --> 00:53:35.989
and tell you how happy I am
that you're gonna come tomorrow...


642
00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:39.490
and how important it is for me.

643
00:53:39.574 --> 00:53:41.448
For me too.

644
00:53:42.741 --> 00:53:44.198
OK.

645
00:53:44.866 --> 00:53:47.115
- See you then.
- See you then.


646
00:53:48.033 --> 00:53:50.324
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>


647
00:54:56.123 --> 00:54:58.372
<i>- Consuela.
- David, where are you?</i>


648
00:54:58.457 --> 00:55:01.164
<i>You won't believe what just happened. My...</i>

649
00:55:01.248 --> 00:55:03.664
<i>I'm stuck on the George Washington Bridge.</i>

650
00:55:06.332 --> 00:55:08.415
My car's broken down.

651
00:55:10.124 --> 00:55:11.915
<i>Consuela?</i>

652
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.916
<i>I... called AAA.</i>

653
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.666
They said they were going to be
at least an hour, then...


654
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.333
they're gonna have to, er,
get me off the bridge,


655
00:55:22.417 --> 00:55:24.541
then tow me someplace, and...

656
00:55:24.626 --> 00:55:26.917
<i>I'll call you when I know more. OK?</i>

657
00:55:28.918 --> 00:55:30.584
<i>Consuela?</i>

658
00:55:32.835 --> 00:55:35.417
Why are you doing this to me?

659
00:55:37.919 --> 00:55:39.709
Consuela?

660
00:55:41.836 --> 00:55:43.335
<i>Hello?</i>

661
00:56:41.508 --> 00:56:43.757
<i>One new message.</i>

662
00:56:43.842 --> 00:56:45.674
<i>First new message.</i>

663
00:56:47.217 --> 00:56:50.174
<i>I saw you today on television,</i>

664
00:56:50.259 --> 00:56:53.925
<i>playing the wise old man
who knows everything,</i>


665
00:56:54.009 --> 00:56:56.592
<i>the one who always knows better,</i>

666
00:56:56.676 --> 00:56:59.884
<i>the one who knows what's good culture
and what people should read</i>


667
00:56:59.968 --> 00:57:02.426
<i>and they shouldn't read, and...</i>

668
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.593
<i>all about music and all about art, and...</i>

669
00:57:08.427 --> 00:57:10.593
<i>You know so many things.</i>

670
00:57:13.386 --> 00:57:21.469
<i>But I'm here trying to celebrate
this important moment of my life</i>


671
00:57:21.553 --> 00:57:24.594
<i>and I decided to have a party
and I want to have you here.</i>


672
00:57:26.929 --> 00:57:30.803
<i>No hay consuelo.</i>

673
00:57:34.013 --> 00:57:36.304
<i>Because you mean everything to me.</i>

674
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.346
<i>You do.</i>

675
00:57:42.305 --> 00:57:45.096
<i>But anyway, you are not here,</i>

676
00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:48.847
<i>and I just want you to know something.</i>

677
00:57:52.348 --> 00:57:54.431
<i>I loved you.</i>

678
00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:58.139
<i>Very much.</i>

679
00:58:00.057 --> 00:58:02.140
<i>Very, very much.</i>

680
00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.309
Consuela?

681
00:58:36.394 --> 00:58:38.476
<i>It's me. Open up.</i>

682
00:58:39.186 --> 00:58:41.477
<i>- Kenny.
- Come on, open up.</i>


683
00:59:11.022 --> 00:59:12.480
Hello.

684
00:59:13.356 --> 00:59:15.438
Why are all the lights off?

685
00:59:35.649 --> 00:59:37.107
I'm having an affair.

686
00:59:41.233 --> 00:59:43.066
Did you hear what I just said?

687
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.358
You.

688
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:49.358
- Is that all you have to say?
- Congratulations.


689
00:59:49.442 --> 00:59:51.858
Congratulations?
You're a riot, do you know that?


690
00:59:51.943 --> 00:59:54.025
Sorry, I'm not sure what to say.

691
00:59:57.652 --> 00:59:59.734
This is awful.

692
01:00:00.527 --> 01:00:02.651
- I'm coming apart!
- I thought you were happily married.


693
01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:04.693
You always told me you were happily married.

694
01:00:04.777 --> 01:00:06.568
- I am. I am.
- Well...


695
01:00:06.652 --> 01:00:09.527
forgive me, but I can't see
how that can be entirely true.


696
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:12.277
Anyway, you don't look
terribly happy right now.


697
01:00:12.361 --> 01:00:13.485
No.

698
01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.861
- But you don't understand.
- Kenny, I'm trying to understand.


699
01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:21.153
You're having an affair,
so you come here because, what,


700
01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:23.195
- I'm the expert?
- Jesus.


701
01:00:23.279 --> 01:00:25.445
There is no one else to talk to.

702
01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:26.903
Sorry.

703
01:00:28.529 --> 01:00:30.029
What are you gonna do?

704
01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:32.987
I don't know.

705
01:00:36.697 --> 01:00:38.988
Would you like something to drink?

706
01:00:41.822 --> 01:00:43.530
What have you got?

707
01:00:43.614 --> 01:00:45.322
Glenfiddich, bourbon,

708
01:00:45.406 --> 01:00:47.322
vodka, Cointreau, 
Grand Marnier,

709
01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:48.864
Armagnac.

710
01:00:48.948 --> 01:00:50.697
Uh, Diet Coke.

711
01:00:51.698 --> 01:00:53.656
Diet Coke it is.

712
01:00:55.157 --> 01:00:58.990
This isn't just some kind
of irresponsible fling.


713
01:00:59.074 --> 01:01:02.615
I love Lisa, I really do,
and the kids are my whole life.


714
01:01:03.324 --> 01:01:09.199
Well, knowing you, it's probably simplest
if you just break off the other...


715
01:01:09.283 --> 01:01:11.408
Oh, I can't.

716
01:01:11.492 --> 01:01:15.991
This woman is like
no one else on earth.

717
01:01:16.076 --> 01:01:19.658
I've never felt so
alive, so full of energy.

718
01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:21.617
And she's a great person.

719
01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:25.034
She, uh... She has degrees
in chemistry and art history,


720
01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:27.367
she plays the oboe, for Christ's sakes.

721
01:01:27.452 --> 01:01:30.243
And her kids are... fabulous.

722
01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:32.701
- She has children?
- Yeah, three.


723
01:01:32.786 --> 01:01:35.076
She's got little Sean...

724
01:01:35.161 --> 01:01:37.493
Hold on, Kenny,
what are we talking about here?


725
01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:39.869
- Her children or your adultery?
- Don't call it that.


726
01:01:39.953 --> 01:01:43.077
- Well, what would you call it?
- See, you sound like Lisa.


727
01:01:43.162 --> 01:01:46.994
You're trying to oversimplify
a complicated situation. I...


728
01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:52.495
I'm committed to this relationship,
unlike you who's terrified of committing to anyone.


729
01:01:52.579 --> 01:01:55.870
Dana is a real person,
so don't equate what's happening to me


730
01:01:55.954 --> 01:01:57.745
with your serial tomcatting.

731
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.120
- What have I got to do with it?
- Plenty.


732
01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.288
Anyway, Dana isn't one of your
little star-struck students.


733
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.580
If you want my advice,

734
01:02:12.664 --> 01:02:15.830
Lisa mustn't know a word of this
until you've made up your mind...


735
01:02:16.436 --> 01:02:20.039
- Lisa already knows.
- Why on earth did you tell Lisa?


736
01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:23.248
- You expect me to lie to my wife?
- Now you can't retreat, even if you want to.


737
01:02:23.332 --> 01:02:25.373
God.

738
01:02:25.457 --> 01:02:30.040
I don't know why I came here. I don't know
what help I thought you could possibly be,


739
01:02:30.124 --> 01:02:32.582
except that maybe... maybe...

740
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.291
I hoped that you might relate to me...

741
01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:41.083
- as a father, for just once.
- I don't know how to relate to you, Kenny.


742
01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:43.291
You're so morally superior
to me in every way,

743
01:02:43.376 --> 01:02:45.875
even our adulteries can't compare.
Yours plays the oboe.


744
01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:47.500
What have I got
to put up against that?

745
01:02:47.584 --> 01:02:50.084
She probably writes poetry in her spare time
and her kids do too.


746
01:02:50.168 --> 01:02:52.084
- You're such a jerk.
- However, if you are,


747
01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.459
as you say, committed,
then you're gonna have to end your marriage.


748
01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:58.793
How can I?
If I walk out on Lisa and the kids,


749
01:02:58.877 --> 01:03:01.835
if I do what you
did, then I'll destroy them.

750
01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:05.585
Why do you say that?
You survived. Your mother survived.


751
01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:08.919
Are you trying to tell me

752
01:03:09.003 --> 01:03:12.294
that you did the morally correct thing

753
01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:15.711
- by walking out on us?
- It was honest.


754
01:03:15.795 --> 01:03:17.878
God! I can't believe you.

755
01:03:24.963 --> 01:03:27.754
- I'm leaving.
- Well, there's the door.


756
01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.921
- Goodbye.
- Bye.


757
01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:50.464
<i>Consuela didn't call the next day.</i>

758
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:56.715
<i>And not even the day after.</i>

759
01:03:59.591 --> 01:04:01.674
<i>She never called again.</i>

760
01:04:25.385 --> 01:04:28.176
You've got to eat something.

761
01:04:28.261 --> 01:04:30.843
You gotta get out of this fucking bed.

762
01:04:31.594 --> 01:04:34.885
- I ruined everything, George.
- You didn't ruin anything.


763
01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:38.052
It just came to its natural end.

764
01:04:38.136 --> 01:04:41.136
You were her teacher,
her big growing-up experience.


765
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.136
You called the whole thing from day one.

766
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.553
It was bound to
end sooner or later. Eat.

767
01:04:47.637 --> 01:04:49.178
I miss her.

768
01:04:49.263 --> 01:04:51.762
Well, that's easy for you to say now
that she's out of the picture.


769
01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:55.220
I was in love with her, George.
I've never felt anything like that in all my life.


770
01:04:55.305 --> 01:04:58.762
Well, it's better late than never.
Now, you gotta get back with your own life.


771
01:04:58.847 --> 01:05:02.096
You're gonna be feeling better soon.
Time heals all wounds.


772
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:05.596
Now, open wide, cos here it comes.

773
01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:08.013
The train into the station.

774
01:05:10.723 --> 01:05:12.972
Open wide. There you go.

775
01:05:13.056 --> 01:05:14.722
Now, how does that taste?

776
01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:18.306
I added a little oregano and some chives.

777
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:20.723
You're gonna make somebody very happy one day.

778
01:05:22.766 --> 01:05:25.723
You know...

779
01:05:25.808 --> 01:05:30.307
after a lifetime of silence and betrayals,

780
01:05:30.391 --> 01:05:35.433
lately Amy and I
have been finding each other again.


781
01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:37.849
You and Amy your wife?
Are you feeling OK?


782
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.350
Yes, I... I feel OK.

783
01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:43.933
It's the most incredible thing I've heard you say
in all the years I've known you.


784
01:05:44.018 --> 01:05:47.267
You know, life always keeps back

785
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:50.142
more surprises than we could ever imagine.

786
01:05:51.185 --> 01:05:52.767
Yeah.

787
01:05:52.852 --> 01:05:58.726
Dave, I need a favor.
I gotta go give a poetry reading at NYU next month


788
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:00.810
and they want somebody to introduce me.

789
01:06:00.894 --> 01:06:04.602
George, I understand you wanting
to distract me, but this is...


790
01:06:04.686 --> 01:06:07.811
it's transparent occupational therapy.

791
01:06:07.895 --> 01:06:10.186
This is no joke. 
I want you to present me

792
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:13.186
in the most embarrassing, flattering terms,

793
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.436
to all those poetry-pandering puffs.

794
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:18.978
Present you? Who's going to present me?
Forest Lawn?


795
01:06:19.063 --> 01:06:23.937
George, you're a champ for asking,
but I can't write anything now.


796
01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:27.646
I'm finished.
I may never teach another class.


797
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.271
Find someone else.

798
01:06:29.355 --> 01:06:34.396
I have spent half of my life playing Horatio
to your third-rate Hamlet,


799
01:06:35.398 --> 01:06:40.605
listening to your endless navel-gazing,
your moaning about Kenny the father hater,


800
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:44.189
the women who don't know
when goodbye means goodbye,


801
01:06:44.273 --> 01:06:47.148
and for this you owe me big-time.

802
01:06:47.232 --> 01:06:51.106
Now, I expect you to do this
in the name of our friendship.


803
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:53.398
Now, would you fucking eat something?

804
01:07:06.442 --> 01:07:08.525
<i>The poetry of George O'Hearn...</i>

805
01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:12.858
<i>makes no apology for himself.</i>

806
01:07:22.569 --> 01:07:27.776
As A.E. Housman wrote in his celebrated essay,

807
01:07:27.861 --> 01:07:30.485
"I don't know what poetry is,

808
01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:33.402
but I recognize it when I hear it."

809
01:07:33.486 --> 01:07:37.027
There can be no question
that this evening's guest


810
01:07:37.112 --> 01:07:41.653
writes what we all instantly recognize as poetry.

811
01:07:41.737 --> 01:07:46.820
Since the publication 25 years ago
of his first work in the New Yorker,


812
01:07:46.904 --> 01:07:50.987
George O'Hearn's vigorously masculine voice

813
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:55.529
has become a fixture
of the American poetic landscape.


814
01:07:55.614 --> 01:07:59.404
Poetry which is at one and the same time
the language of the street,


815
01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:04.405
potent, urban and impatient,

816
01:08:04.489 --> 01:08:08.447
but also the un-self-centered promptings

817
01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:10.697
of an unquiet heart.

818
01:08:11.365 --> 01:08:15.948
In 1988, that unique combination of sensibilities

819
01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:20.156
earned George O'
Hearn the Pulitzer Prize.

820
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:24.240
But rather than procrastinate further

821
01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:29.241
or damn him with praise
he will inevitably consider faint,


822
01:08:29.325 --> 01:08:31.866
I will turn the proceedings over

823
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:37.658
to New York's own,
or should I say America's own,


824
01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:39.533
George O'Hearn.

825
01:08:52.952 --> 01:08:54.951
George. George.

826
01:08:55.536 --> 01:08:58.535
I'm gonna call somebody.

827
01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:21.496
Hi, David.

828
01:09:30.706 --> 01:09:32.788
He just woke up a little while ago.

829
01:09:55.417 --> 01:09:56.874
Hi, David.

830
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.041
George.

831
01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:09.667
It's Kepesh.

832
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.543
I'm here, George. I'm here.

833
01:10:58.422 --> 01:10:59.880
George...

834
01:11:05.006 --> 01:11:07.089
I owe you.

835
01:11:53.678 --> 01:11:55.927
I wonder who he thought I was.

836
01:11:58.178 --> 01:12:00.261
I think he knew perfectly well.

837
01:12:04.679 --> 01:12:06.553
You're sweet.

838
01:12:09.179 --> 01:12:13.970
You took him as he was.
He so appreciated that.


839
01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.679
He took me the same.

840
01:12:28.806 --> 01:12:32.222
- You're going where?
- I just told you. Florida.


841
01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:35.222
To meet her parents.
It's just for the weekend.


842
01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.973
- The girl's...
- Her name is Dana.


843
01:12:38.057 --> 01:12:40.098
You're gonna meet her folks?

844
01:12:40.182 --> 01:12:43.515
Well, I think they should know
that I'm just not some kind of pervert.


845
01:12:43.599 --> 01:12:45.557
Kenny, you're nearly 40 years old,

846
01:12:45.641 --> 01:12:50.349
you don't need the approval of the parents
of a girl who has three children of her own.


847
01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:52.641
It... Does she want her parents' approval?

848
01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.766
If you want my
approval, fine, you've got it.

849
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:58.016
I just wanted you to understand,
cos this doesn't mean


850
01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.808
that I don't love Lisa,

851
01:13:00.892 --> 01:13:03.058
- I just need to...
- Kenny, what are you doing?


852
01:13:03.143 --> 01:13:05.267
You're gonna escape from one prison

853
01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:09.476
and race headlong into another
maximum-security facility.


854
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.559
Where did you get the idea
that marriage is a prison?


855
01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:14.059
From serving time.

856
01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:17.435
Look, it wasn't about your mum,
I just wasn't cut out for it.


857
01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:19.601
Is this your version of approval?

858
01:13:21.519 --> 01:13:24.769
Kenny, listen to me.
I'm the only father you have.


859
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:27.977
I'm the only one you'll ever have.

860
01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:30.644
What a comfort that is.

861
01:13:30.729 --> 01:13:32.769
I know I've disappointed you,

862
01:13:32.854 --> 01:13:35.811
but you're not a child
and you've got to get past this rage.


863
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:39.645
If you ever want there to be
anything between us


864
01:13:39.729 --> 01:13:41.520
you've got to turn the page.

865
01:13:43.438 --> 01:13:45.729
Excuse me, I have an appointment.

866
01:13:45.813 --> 01:13:47.312
I'm not finished.

867
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:49.771
- Hey.
- I really have to run.


868
01:13:49.855 --> 01:13:51.771
- What appointment?
- George's funeral.


869
01:13:51.856 --> 01:13:54.396
- George who? Your friend George?
- Yeah.


870
01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:57.230
- He died?
- Yeah. I really... I have to run.


871
01:13:57.314 --> 01:13:59.355
We'll finish this later, OK?

872
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.105
I'm sorry.

873
01:14:22.108 --> 01:14:23.733
Hello.

874
01:14:23.817 --> 01:14:27.816
No, I just... I happened to be in town,
I saw the obit in the Times, and...


875
01:14:27.901 --> 01:14:30.191
Two full columns.

876
01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:32.358
Not bad for a poet, I guess.

877
01:14:34.276 --> 01:14:36.317
How are you holding up?

878
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:38.484
Not so good, but I'll be OK.

879
01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.943
How's everything?

880
01:14:42.694 --> 01:14:45.443
Seattle's a great place to build a business.

881
01:14:45.527 --> 01:14:47.443
I'm exhausted.

882
01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:51.027
But I love it. I...

883
01:14:55.362 --> 01:14:57.444
What are you thinking about, David?

884
01:14:57.528 --> 01:14:59.319
Nothing.

885
01:14:59.987 --> 01:15:02.695
We kept acting like teenagers all our life.

886
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:04.986
That's all.

887
01:15:07.196 --> 01:15:10.445
- Who's... Who's we? Me and you?
- Yes, you and I.


888
01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.612
We spent our life...

889
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:17.238
chasing after what?

890
01:15:19.489 --> 01:15:22.655
And the only time you got pregnant
you had an abortion because the time wasn't right,


891
01:15:22.739 --> 01:15:24.405
and that was 15 years ago.

892
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:29.364
Did the right time ever come?

893
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.989
Nor the right person.

894
01:15:58.159 --> 01:16:00.825
Remember that tampon you found in my bathroom?

895
01:16:01.993 --> 01:16:05.242
That thing belonged to a young girl
I was in love with.


896
01:16:06.493 --> 01:16:08.117
What...

897
01:16:09.994 --> 01:16:13.451
kind of a chance did we have,
she and I?


898
01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:15.576
None.

899
01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:17.785
At best we'd have dragged it out
a couple of years


900
01:16:17.869 --> 01:16:22.869
but in the end she'd have realized
that there was little room in her life


901
01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.244
for a man 30-odd years older than she.

902
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.745
Nothing... ever should have happened
between me and that girl.


903
01:16:36.705 --> 01:16:38.787
It was just a mistake.

904
01:16:52.498 --> 01:16:54.539
I'm getting old, David.

905
01:16:57.248 --> 01:17:00.372
The way men look
at me changes every day.

906
01:17:05.999 --> 01:17:09.832
There are women my
age, a lot of women,

907
01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:15.040
who are on these dating websites.

908
01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:19.124
You're guaranteed
a certain number of dates per year.


909
01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:23.750
You pay for the silence and the...

910
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:28.917
And...

911
01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.542
and the same conversation every time.

912
01:17:39.544 --> 01:17:41.543
I'll end up like them.

913
01:17:44.211 --> 01:17:48.502
Is it possible that this is really
the first time we talked to each other?


914
01:17:51.587 --> 01:17:52.836
Well...

915
01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:59.128
after 20 years of sleeping together,
that's not bad.


916
01:17:59.212 --> 01:18:05.087
I know a lot of people who never got that far
in 40 years of marriage.


917
01:18:28.923 --> 01:18:31.756
What time's your flight?

918
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.340
9:30.

919
01:18:34.466 --> 01:18:37.007
I'll take you.

920
01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:42.007
No.

921
01:18:44.092 --> 01:18:46.132
Why start now?

922
01:20:03.349 --> 01:20:05.640
<i>I concentrated on my work.</i>

923
01:20:05.724 --> 01:20:07.807
<i>I kept asking myself</i>

924
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:14.224
<i>if it was right not to go
to that fucked-up graduation party of hers.</i>


925
01:20:20.351 --> 01:20:23.600
<i>It took two years but I finally
got past the death of George,</i>


926
01:20:23.684 --> 01:20:27.100
<i>I even accepted the loss of Consuela.</i>

927
01:20:28.852 --> 01:20:31.851
<i>I recovered my equilibrium
and my independence.</i>


928
01:20:36.561 --> 01:20:38.643
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

929
01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:55.728
And then the paintings
and the sculptures of the day


930
01:20:55.812 --> 01:20:59.687
would, literally and figuratively,
absorb the energy.


931
01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:03.395
They were almost a self-contained
slice of life, if you will.


932
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.063
That... That you put beautifully
in your opening chapter


933
01:21:08.147 --> 01:21:11.646
but also you... you're making a comment

934
01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:14.271
on the relationship between art and ownership.

935
01:21:14.356 --> 01:21:15.563
That's exactly right.

936
01:21:15.648 --> 01:21:20.689
The people who buy these paintings,
they think that they own the pictures.


937
01:21:20.773 --> 01:21:23.356
But in reality the pictures own them.

938
01:21:23.898 --> 01:21:25.397
Pictures own them.

939
01:21:25.482 --> 01:21:28.398
It'll outlive...
It'll outlast them all.


940
01:21:28.482 --> 01:21:31.815
They're merely custodians for a period of time.

941
01:21:31.899 --> 01:21:34.940
They're free to admire it,
they're free to worship it if they like.


942
01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:38.315
In theory, you could purchase the great pyramid.

943
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.774
Take your point, but at
the end of the day

944
01:21:40.858 --> 01:21:44.524
the pyramid would still be around
and you'd be...


945
01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.608
With the pharaohs.

946
01:21:46.692 --> 01:21:50.650
My guest today is Susan Reese.
Her novel is Blue Hyacinth.


947
01:21:50.734 --> 01:21:53.775
This is Book Chat. 
I'm David Kepesh.

948
01:21:55.401 --> 01:21:58.067
And that's it?
That was lovely. Thank you.


949
01:21:58.152 --> 01:21:59.901
- Not too painful.
- Indeed.


950
01:22:02.527 --> 01:22:04.401
Oh, a gentleman.

951
01:22:05.236 --> 01:22:06.860
Thank you.

952
01:22:06.944 --> 01:22:10.318
- Oh! And happy New Year.
- Thank you and congratulations.


953
01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:14.652
- It really is a... a good read.
- Thank you.

<i>One new message.
Six saved messages.</i>


955
01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:43.530
<i>First new message.</i>

956
01:22:45.406 --> 01:22:50.447
<i>Hi, David, it's Consuela.
How are you?</i>


957
01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:55.281
<i>It's really strange to call you but...</i>

958
01:22:55.365 --> 01:22:58.531
<i>I wanna talk to you.
I wanna tell you something.</i>


959
01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:04.657
<i>I wanna tell you myself
before you hear it from someone else.</i>


960
01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:12.408
<i>Please call when you can.
My cell phone number is 555-0122.</i>


961
01:23:13.325 --> 01:23:15.408
<i>Please call. Thanks. Bye.</i>

962
01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.075
<i>Hi, David, it's Consuela...</i>

963
01:23:19.159 --> 01:23:23.617
<i>I realized I lived all these years
just to listen to these words.</i>


964
01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:30.784
<i>I collapsed to the floor listening
to her message again and again,</i>


965
01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:32.743
<i>fearing the worst.</i>

966
01:23:36.994 --> 01:23:40.535
<i>She was in love,
she was getting married.</i>


967
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.244
<i>Perhaps she even wanted my blessing.</i>

968
01:23:57.059 --> 01:23:58.162
<i>David?</i>

969
01:24:01.538 --> 01:24:03.204
<i>David?</i>

970
01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:06.288
Where are you?

971
01:24:07.247 --> 01:24:11.372
<i>I'm in the car. I was in front of your building
when I left the message.</i>


972
01:24:13.331 --> 01:24:17.080
What are you doing driving round New York
on New Year's Eve?


973
01:24:17.165 --> 01:24:19.622
<i>I don't know.</i>

974
01:24:21.582 --> 01:24:23.581
<i>I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

975
01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:25.581
What's the matter, Consuela?

976
01:24:29.041 --> 01:24:32.415
<i>- I need to see you.
- Then come.</i>


977
01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:35.916
<i>- Do you have time?
- Always.</i>


978
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.541
<i>- OK. I'm coming now.
- Yes.</i>


979
01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:13.044
Hi.

980
01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:15.586
Hello.

981
01:25:36.797 --> 01:25:40.755
So... how have you been?

982
01:25:45.923 --> 01:25:47.672
That one's new.

983
01:25:48.632 --> 01:25:51.423
Yeah, it's... Edward Weston.

984
01:25:54.591 --> 01:25:56.340
I like your hair.

985
01:25:58.799 --> 01:26:01.215
I cut a little each day.

986
01:26:03.175 --> 01:26:06.132
So when it disappears
I won't miss it as much.


987
01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:25.468
I'm sick.

988
01:26:28.386 --> 01:26:29.968
I have...

989
01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.885
cancer, breast cancer.

990
01:26:42.262 --> 01:26:44.219
I'm having surgery in two weeks.

991
01:26:44.304 --> 01:26:46.220
Cancer?

992
01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:49.595
This is...

993
01:26:51.429 --> 01:26:52.887
Are you...

994
01:26:52.971 --> 01:26:58.054
- All right? No, not exactly.
- Well, that's not what I meant.


995
01:26:58.138 --> 01:26:59.679
I meant...

996
01:27:00.972 --> 01:27:03.179
What happened?

997
01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:15.347
I was in the shower one morning
and I felt this thing under my arm


998
01:27:16.182 --> 01:27:20.806
so I went to the doctor and he said
it was probably nothing to worry about


999
01:27:20.891 --> 01:27:25.057
and I went to a second doctor
and a third doctor and...


1000
01:27:25.141 --> 01:27:27.390
You know the story.

1001
01:27:27.474 --> 01:27:31.849
The third doctor said
it was something to worry about.


1002
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.266
And did you panic?

1003
01:27:36.642 --> 01:27:38.391
Yes, I panicked.

1004
01:27:38.476 --> 01:27:43.142
I've spent the whole month in pure fear.

1005
01:27:43.226 --> 01:27:47.100
Tonight I was gonna go
to this party thinking...


1006
01:27:48.393 --> 01:27:51.851
Thinking that it would be better
than staying by myself, but...


1007
01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:56.560
David!

1008
01:27:56.644 --> 01:27:59.727
David, no. Don't cry.

1009
01:28:01.269 --> 01:28:04.185
Oh, don't cry.

1010
01:28:05.645 --> 01:28:07.144
Why didn't you...

1011
01:28:07.228 --> 01:28:11.144
Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't you call me when this happened?


1012
01:28:13.396 --> 01:28:15.145
I couldn't tell you.

1013
01:28:16.021 --> 01:28:18.728
I couldn't tell you of all people.

1014
01:28:21.271 --> 01:28:23.145
You know what's funny?

1015
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.396
I feel older than you now.

1016
01:28:28.605 --> 01:28:30.521
You promise me one thing.

1017
01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:35.563
If you should ever start to panic
during the night or during the day or any time,


1018
01:28:35.648 --> 01:28:37.272
you phone me.

1019
01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:42.439
What can I do? 
What can I do?

1020
01:28:48.232 --> 01:28:51.023
It's... Oh!

1021
01:28:57.691 --> 01:29:01.982
It's like... not being... able

1022
01:29:02.067 --> 01:29:05.566
to get into a... comfortable position

1023
01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:10.900
cos no matter which way you turn
you're stuck.


1024
01:29:13.485 --> 01:29:15.942
I'm stuck inside myself.

1025
01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:29.110
When I think of all the things
I used to think were so important,


1026
01:29:29.194 --> 01:29:32.860
all the arguments I
got into with my mum.

1027
01:29:33.611 --> 01:29:38.152
So stupid, all the time I wasted...
sleeping...


1028
01:29:39.779 --> 01:29:43.570
sleeping... sleeping my life away.

1029
01:29:52.447 --> 01:29:53.862
David.

1030
01:29:57.614 --> 01:29:59.738
I need to ask you a favor.

1031
01:30:00.864 --> 01:30:03.030
Something I can only ask you.

1032
01:30:04.823 --> 01:30:07.989
Yeah. Anything. What is it?

1033
01:30:19.782 --> 01:30:21.323
After you...

1034
01:30:22.866 --> 01:30:27.532
I never had a boyfriend... who...

1035
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.449
who loved my body as much you did.

1036
01:30:32.534 --> 01:30:34.616
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

1037
01:30:35.951 --> 01:30:37.575
Were there many?

1038
01:30:39.118 --> 01:30:40.742
No.

1039
01:30:40.826 --> 01:30:43.784
What about work?
Nobody fall in love with you at work?


1040
01:30:43.868 --> 01:30:46.326
- A few did.
- Well, of course they did.


1041
01:30:48.494 --> 01:30:50.618
I just wasn't interested.

1042
01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:00.160
I know you loved me.

1043
01:31:01.286 --> 01:31:03.286
And you loved my body.

1044
01:31:05.495 --> 01:31:06.869
So...

1045
01:31:08.245 --> 01:31:13.120
- before the doctors... ruin it...
- Stop.


1046
01:31:13.204 --> 01:31:16.912
Stop talking that way,
stop thinking that way.


1047
01:31:17.746 --> 01:31:20.287
Consuela, no one's going to ruin you.

1048
01:31:27.581 --> 01:31:28.996
Consuela...

1049
01:31:31.123 --> 01:31:33.288
what is it you want me to do?

1050
01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.304
There's the Paris Opera House.

1051
01:34:30.056 --> 01:34:31.805
I missed you.

1052
01:34:34.432 --> 01:34:37.014
I missed all the places we never went.

1053
01:34:58.517 --> 01:35:00.683
Would you like to stay here tonight?

1054
01:35:06.768 --> 01:35:08.225
No.

1055
01:35:10.102 --> 01:35:11.726
I have to go.

1056
01:35:16.519 --> 01:35:20.060
Would you like me to go with you
when you go to the hospital?


1057
01:35:23.228 --> 01:35:24.894
Consuela...

1058
01:35:26.728 --> 01:35:28.644
you can't do this alone.

1059
01:35:32.604 --> 01:35:36.186
Why do you say that?
You do everything alone.


1060
01:35:45.313 --> 01:35:48.896
David. Poor man.

1061
01:35:51.231 --> 01:35:53.480
You are more scared than me.

1062
01:36:04.565 --> 01:36:07.648
Will you still wanna fuck me
if I lose my breast?


1063
01:36:12.483 --> 01:36:14.648
Will you be up for that?

1064
01:36:15.233 --> 01:36:16.732
Will you?

1065
01:36:33.443 --> 01:36:35.359
I'm sorry, David.

1066
01:36:38.443 --> 01:36:39.734
I'm sorry.

1067
01:36:46.444 --> 01:36:48.360
I'm scared, David.

1068
01:36:48.444 --> 01:36:53.569
<i>Five! Four! Three! Two! One!</i>

1069
01:36:53.653 --> 01:36:56.027
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1070
01:36:56.112 --> 01:37:02.778
<i>I wanna wish everyone
a happy and healthy New Year.</i>


1071
01:37:02.862 --> 01:37:06.903
<i>Peace and goodwill to everybody.</i>

1072
01:37:13.655 --> 01:37:15.779
Happy New Year.

1073
01:38:25.162 --> 01:38:27.203
- Dad.
- Hi.


1074
01:38:27.287 --> 01:38:28.619
What are you doing here?

1075
01:38:28.704 --> 01:38:30.828
I wondered if you could spare me
a few minutes.


1076
01:38:30.912 --> 01:38:34.037
- Uh... You know...
- It's important.


1077
01:38:37.163 --> 01:38:39.245
All right. Down here.

1078
01:38:41.955 --> 01:38:43.871
Yep, uh-huh.

1079
01:38:44.872 --> 01:38:47.288
Thanks. I owe you one. Bye.

1080
01:38:52.373 --> 01:38:55.205
She's in very good hands.
I know her surgeon.


1081
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:58.497
- And?
- They're gonna operate tomorrow.


1082
01:38:58.582 --> 01:39:00.081
She told me in two weeks.

1083
01:39:00.165 --> 01:39:06.081
- No. They're gonna do it tomorrow.
- What does that mean?


1084
01:39:06.166 --> 01:39:11.999
I'm not her doctor, so I don't know exactly,
but it's probably not a good thing.


1085
01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:16.499
This is such... 
It's a nightmare.

1086
01:39:20.917 --> 01:39:25.208
- Have you known her long?
- I haven't seen her for a couple of years.


1087
01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:28.750
She called me out of the blue
on New Year's Eve with the news and...


1088
01:39:31.835 --> 01:39:36.292
I've got all her phone numbers but I don't...
you know, I don't want to make the wrong move here.


1089
01:39:36.377 --> 01:39:40.585
She... When she left she told me
she didn't want me to call her.


1090
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:42.835
She was quite definite about that.

1091
01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:47.669
Sorry.

1092
01:39:48.836 --> 01:39:50.169
Yeah.

1093
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.877
I know, I'm coming.

1094
01:39:52.962 --> 01:39:57.128
Look, sorry to have barged in on you like this.
I know you're strapped for time.


1095
01:39:57.212 --> 01:40:00.253
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

1096
01:40:00.337 --> 01:40:03.837
- Stay strong.
- That's what you tell your patients, isn't it?


1097
01:40:05.005 --> 01:40:07.754
Must be really tough in college.

1098
01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:12.754
I was your son, 
I was prepared for it.

1099
01:40:12.839 --> 01:40:14.713
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Yeah.


1100
01:40:14.797 --> 01:40:18.588
- I'm sorry it was under such... You know.
- Me too.


1101
01:40:18.673 --> 01:40:21.297
How are things at home?

1102
01:40:21.381 --> 01:40:25.172
We're still together. 
Thanks for asking.

1103
01:40:25.256 --> 01:40:26.881
Glad to hear it.

1104
01:40:31.799 --> 01:40:33.340
So, Dad...

1105
01:40:36.549 --> 01:40:38.423
what are you gonna do?

1106
01:40:53.009 --> 01:40:54.925
Why did she have me
take these photographs?


1107
01:40:55.009 --> 01:40:57.092
Did she want them for herself or...

1108
01:40:59.343 --> 01:41:02.676
did she intend for me to keep them?

1109
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:08.593
Well, that makes sense.
Did I ever tell you my theory about beautiful girls?


1110
01:41:08.677 --> 01:41:13.760
- A million times. No one can see them.
- Well?


1111
01:41:13.844 --> 01:41:15.927
Did you ever see her?

1112
01:41:16.928 --> 01:41:19.052
I mean all of her.

1113
01:41:20.887 --> 01:41:23.053
I didn't understand what I saw.

1114
01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:28.886
Lawyer's answer.
You're over-analyzing again.


1115
01:41:28.971 --> 01:41:31.053
Who would end a relationship...

1116
01:41:32.388 --> 01:41:34.720
because I missed a graduation party?

1117
01:41:34.805 --> 01:41:38.887
She was this weird clutch of inconsistencies.

1118
01:41:38.972 --> 01:41:41.888
You're talking about her in the past tense.

1119
01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:53.806
So do you think they
will let me in today?

1120
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:57.598
<i>She just got out of intensive care.
You can go today.</i>


1121
01:41:58.599 --> 01:42:02.015
<i>- Kenny, thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>


1122
01:42:05.266 --> 01:42:08.057
<i>Time passes when you're not looking.</i>

1123
01:43:20.898 --> 01:43:23.647
- David.
- Yes?


1124
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:30.606
They took the whole thing.

1125
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:39.107
I didn't think you would come.

1126
01:43:40.817 --> 01:43:42.066
Why?

1127
01:43:47.984 --> 01:43:49.900
Why did you think that?

1128
01:43:51.609 --> 01:43:54.025
Because I'm no longer beautiful.

1129
01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:57.109
Yes, you are.

1130
01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:03.693
You know Hippolyta,
the beautiful Amazonian queen?


1131
01:44:03.777 --> 01:44:08.818
She actually cut off her right breast
so she could shoot her arrows faster


1132
01:44:08.903 --> 01:44:11.319
and that Hippolyta, she was no slouch.

1133
01:44:25.946 --> 01:44:30.112
Will the book be different
if we read it ten years later?


1134
01:44:32.363 --> 01:44:34.612
You remember my first class.

1135
01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:43.363
I remember everything.

1136
01:44:44.239 --> 01:44:45.655
Me too.

1137
01:44:46.531 --> 01:44:48.614
Every second.

1138
01:44:59.657 --> 01:45:01.907
I will miss you.

1139
01:45:26.285 --> 01:45:28.369
I'm here.
