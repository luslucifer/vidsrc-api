5
00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.287
有句老話，你們都曾听人說過﹕

6
00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.287
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression,


7
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:32.001
“凡事皆有因”，
不過，我覺得這句話用在我身上并不恰當


8
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:32.001
''Everything happens for a reason''?
Well, I don't think that applies to me.


9
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.795
我是說，我把每個早上都花在
匆匆忙忙赶去上班上面了


10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.795
I mean, I spend every morning
rushing to work


11
00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:38.716
奮力地赶著同一班地鐵，
做著同一份無謂的差事


12
00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:38.716
trying to catch the same subway
to the same lousy job.


13
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.134
有什么理由會這樣﹖

14
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.134
What's the reason for that?

15
00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:44.596
我在芝加哥最大的出版社任一名調查員

16
00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:44.596
See, I'm a researcher for one of the
biggest publishing houses in Chicago,


17
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.682
但是我真正想呆的部門是在創意部

18
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.682
but where I really belong is in Creative.

19
00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:51.312
問題是，我的老板還沒意識到這點，
所以我算是失意至极了


20
00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:51.312
The problem is, is my boss doesn't
know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.


21
00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.355
我的朋友保羅一直跟我說

22
00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.355
While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

23
00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:56.608
“你要樂觀一點，要積极一點”

24
00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:56.608
''You gotta be optimistic.
You gotta be positive. ''


25
00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.235
行，行，你們知道嗎﹖

26
00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.235
OK. OK. You know what?

27
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.739
今天會是我的幸運日，今天會是我的...

28
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.739
Today is gonna be my lucky day.
Today is gonna be my...


29
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.034
- 啊﹗
- 噢﹗哇哦﹗


30
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.034
- Aah!
- Oh! Wow!


31
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:08.078
- 嘿，看這個，今天是你的幸運日
- 你看到了嗎﹖


32
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:08.078
- Hey, look at that, lt's your lucky day,
- Did you just see that?


33
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.121
噢，這种事我都見過無數次了

34
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.121
Oh, l've seen it a million times,

35
00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:10.581
- 你要不要﹖
- 不要


36
00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:10.581
- You want it?
- No,


37
00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.250
我也不要，給你吧，這下你有新的公文包了

38
00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.250
l don't want it, Go ahead,
You got a new briefcase,


39
00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:15.252
是啊，說不定上面有名字或者什么

40
00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:15.252
Yeah, maybe its got a name
on it or something,


41
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.713
- 噢，拜托，你怎么回事﹖你是傻瓜嗎﹖
- 什么﹖


42
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.713
- Oh, come,,, What are you, nuts?
- What?


43
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.340
- 你要把它還回去﹖
- 是的


44
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.340
- You're gonna return it?
- Yeah,


45
00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:21.592
你不是剛說過你需要一個新包嗎﹖

46
00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:21.592
Did you not just say
you needed a new one?


47
00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.093
是的，等我升職的時候

48
00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.093
Yeah, when l get my raise,

49
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.137
你在那干了不是有...一年了嗎﹖

50
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.137
Haven't you been working
there for, like, a year?


51
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.598
我敢打賭泰勒甚至都不知道你在他那干，
換作是我，我會為此非常生气


52
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.598
l bet Taylor doesn't even know
you work there, l'd be pissed,


53
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.935
- 你生气嗎﹖我會生气
- 是的，我...我有一點生气


54
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.935
- Are you pissed? l'd be pissed,
- Yeah, l'm-l'm a little pissed,


55
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:35.272
這一說倒讓我想到一件事，
我從來沒有真正見過你發火


56
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:35.272
You know, come to think of it,
l've never really seen you angry before,


57
00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:36.899
漢德森，你曾見過湯姆真正發一回火嗎﹖

58
00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:36.899
Henderson, you ever
seen Tom really angry?


59
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:39.652
- 沒有
- 好了，沒錯，我沒有發過火


60
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:39.652
- No,
- All right, fine, So l don't get angry,


61
00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.445
怎么了，是件坏事﹖

62
00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.445
What is that, a bad thing?

63
00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:45.074
你要知道，如果你把怒气一直壓抑著，
那么遲早有一天...


64
00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:45.074
lt's, you know, you keep it bottled up
and then sooner or later,


65
00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:48.202
...你來上班的時候，你會干掉所有人，
用一支...


66
00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:48.202
you come into work and you mow
everyone down with one of those,,,


67
00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.455
- AK-47自動步槍
- AK-47，僅僅是為了給某人
留個印象，比如...


68
00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.455
- AK-47,
- AK-47, You know, just to impress, uh,,,


69
00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:53.290
- 茱迪.福斯特
- 茱迪.福斯特


70
00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:53.290
- Jodie Foster,
- Jodie Foster,


71
00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.627
好吧，我會等你們休假
的時候再動手，行了嗎﹖


72
00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.627
(chuckles)) All right, l'll do it
on your day off, all right?


73
00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:01.256
哦，來了，你的“茱迪.福斯特”來了

74
00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:01.256
(Paul) Touch? There she is,
lt's your Jodie Foster,


75
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.341
保羅，別這樣，老兄

76
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.341
Paul, come on, man,

77
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:03.717
如果你只是坐在這，你怎么可能認識她﹖

78
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:03.717
How you ever gonna get
to know her if you just sit there?


79
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.761
她是泰勒的女儿，老兄，我不可能就...

80
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.761
lt's Taylor's daughter, man, l can't just,,,

81
00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:10.265
你不可能就什么﹖嗯﹖
你想一輩子沒出息嗎﹖嗯﹖


82
00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:10.265
You can't just what? Huh? Are you
gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?


83
00:02:10.307 --> 00:02:13.686
勇敢地走過去，跟她說話，上呀

84
00:02:10.307 --> 00:02:13.686
Just go over there
and talk to her, Go, Go,


85
00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.605
- 行行行，我上，我上
- 你上


86
00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.605
- OK, fine, l'm going, l'm going,
- You're going,


87
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:35.666
打扰了...

88
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:35.666
Excuse me,

89
00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.251
啊﹗

90
00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.251
Aah!

91
00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.336
(baby crying))

92
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.673
(mouthing))

93
00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.387
嗨，我是...

94
00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.387
Hi, l'm--

95
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.724
啊

96
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.724
Ah,,,

97
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.185
我...噢﹗

98
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.185
l-
- Oh!

99
00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:59.231
哦...我...他...

100
00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:59.231
Uh,,, l-

101
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:01.984
噢

102
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:01.984
Oh,

103
00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:08.157
(dog growling))

104
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.199
噢﹗噢...

105
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.199
Oh! Uh,,,

106
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.702
- 你把我的狗怎么了﹖
- 夫人...


107
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.702
- What are you doing to my dog?
- Ma'am,,,


108
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:14.621
- 誰在逗我的狗﹖
- 沒人逗你的狗，它...


109
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:14.621
- Who's taunting my dog?
- No one's taunting your dog, He--


110
00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:16.457
噢﹗哦...

111
00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:16.457
Oh! Uh,,,

112
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.584
哦，這...這只狗...嗯...

113
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.584
Um, the-the d-
- Um,,,

114
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:22.713
不如你坐我的位置﹖坐吧

115
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:22.713
Here, why don't you take my seat? Here,

116
00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:26.842
不賴，你真不賴

117
00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:26.842
Great, Now, that's great,

118
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.510
多給我兩分鐘，我都能比你更接近她

119
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.510
Two more minutes, and l'm gonna
be closer than you are,


120
00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:30.179
看，有机會了，快過去

121
00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:30.179
Look, Opening, Go,

122
00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.306
快過去

123
00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.306
Just go,

124
00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.642
快上

125
00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.642
Go, Go,

126
00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:37.519
沒事，快過去

127
00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:37.519
lt's OK, Go, just go,

128
00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:44.568
“萊克街，下一站是萊克街”

129
00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:44.568
(conductor) Lake Street.
Lake Street is next.


130
00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:49.865
你是湯姆.斯坦菲爾德，是嗎﹖調查部的﹖

131
00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:49.865
You're Tom Stansfield, right?
From Research?


132
00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:53.869
沒錯，沒錯，湯姆，湯姆.斯坦菲爾德

133
00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:53.869
Yeah, Yeah, Tom, 
Tom Stansfield,

134
00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.086
調查部的...斯坦菲爾德

135
00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.086
Stansfield from Research,

136
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.674
那是一項很有前途的運動，知道嗎﹖

137
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.674
lt's a growing sport, you know?

138
00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.218
保羅，她不可能認為那是一本摔跤雜志

139
00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.218
Paul, there is no way that she thought
that it was a wrestling magazine,


140
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.845
噢，拜托，忘了這件事吧，行不行﹖

141
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.845
Oh, come on, Get over it, OK?

142
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.139
你是有點尷尬，不過已經發生了，行了嗎﹖

143
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.139
You're a little embarrassed,
lt happens, OK?


144
00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:15.849
我跟你說，從包里掉出一本裸男雜志...

145
00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:15.849
Let me tell you something,
lf l had a dime for every time


146
00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:17.768
...對我來說是家常便飯了，
開玩笑，開玩笑


147
00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:17.768
a gay naked magazine fell out of my,,,
l'm kidding, l'm kidding,


148
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.811
什么﹖保羅﹗

149
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.811
What? Paul!

150
00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.604
不說了，不過認真說來你是出了點丑

151
00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.604
No, But seriously,
so you're a little humiliated,


152
00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:23.732
但至少現在我們确定她知道你是誰了，對不對﹖

153
00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:23.732
At least now we've established
that she knows who you are, right?


154
00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:25.776
- 我要被赶出這家公司了
- 不，你不會的


155
00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:25.776
- l'm gonna have to leave the company,
- No, you're not,


156
00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:27.152
噢，天吶，是她

157
00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:27.152
Oh, God, There she is,

158
00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:29.279
哦，還有，我需要馬上看到泰國方面的校樣

159
00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:29.279
Oh, and l need to see the proofs
on Thailand immediately,


160
00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.532
就這樣，還有別的什么沒有﹖

161
00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.532
All right, What else have we got?

162
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.957
- 你是湯姆﹖
- 是的


163
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.957
- Are you Tom?
- Yes,


164
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.086
- 泰勒先生要見你
- 噢...好的


165
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.086
- Mr, Taylor wants to see you,
- Oh,,, OK,


166
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:45.754
好的

167
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:45.754
OK,

168
00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:49.341
看到沒有﹖你的机會來了，這就是命運，
這就是我一直在說的...


169
00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:49.341
OK, you see? This is your chance, This
is fate, This is what l'm talking about,


170
00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:52.428
...去創意部發展的一個嶄新的机會，
你就是做這份工作的最佳人選


171
00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:52.428
lt's about that new opening in Creative
and you're the man for the job,


172
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.847
你將要走進去，你將要向他推銷那些書的构思

173
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.847
You're gonna go in there and you're
gonna pitch him those book ideas,


174
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.765
不行，只是我...我真的還沒准備好

175
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.765
No, l just,,, l'm really not ready,

176
00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:59.059
好了，廢話少說，現在我們要飛黃騰達了

177
00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:59.059
Let's get to business,
Now we're steppin' up, OK,


178
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:00.811
來吧，你將要走進去，你將要給他狠狠一擊

179
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:00.811
Come on, You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna pitch him an inside curve,,,


180
00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:02.271
等等，我的蘭色文件夾呢﹖

181
00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:02.271
Wait, wait, Where is my blue folder?

182
00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:04.565
你不需要它，別再找借口了，來吧

183
00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:04.565
You don't need it, Enough with
the excuses already, Come here,


184
00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:07.151
- 你看上去很棒，你感覺很棒嗎﹖
- 我覺得想吐


185
00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:07.151
- You look good, You feel good?
- l feel like l'm gonna throw up,


186
00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:09.028
很好，就是需要這种感覺

187
00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:09.028
Well, that's good,
l want you to use that, OK?


188
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.196
這是什么﹖你老爸的﹖
不錯，快進去吧，好嗎﹖


189
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.196
What is this? This dad's?
lt's nice, Now get in there, OK?


190
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.074
- 別...別碰我屁股
- 什么﹖只是輕輕一拍，很輕的


191
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.074
- Don't-don't touch my ass,
- What? lt was a light spank, lt was light,


192
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.579
- 嘿
- 嘿


193
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.579
- Hey,
- Hey,


194
00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:21.248
- 嗯，我就這么進去﹖
- 噢，別急，他還沒結束


195
00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:21.248
- Uh, do l just go in there?
- Um, no, He's not finished yet,


196
00:05:21.332 --> 00:05:23.667
- 你可以先在那邊坐一會
- 噢，好的


197
00:05:21.332 --> 00:05:23.667
- but you can have a seat over there,
- Oh, OK,


198
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.337
我來解釋給你听，漢德森

199
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.337
Let me explain something
to you, Henderson,


200
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.800
我不是不喜歡你的构思，
我根本就是認為它們令人厭惡


201
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.800
l did not dislike your ideas,
l found them loathsome,


202
00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:36.305
我憎厭它們

203
00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:36.305
l hated them,

204
00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:38.974
- 你可以走人了
- 离開你的辦公室﹖


205
00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:38.974
- You're dismissed,
- From your office?


206
00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:41.101
你想得美﹗

207
00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:41.101
Nice try,

208
00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:47.941
- 祝你好運，你會需要它的
- 他可以見你了


209
00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:47.941
- Good luck, You're gonna need it,,,
- He's ready to see you,


210
00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:49.360
你可以進去了

211
00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:49.360
You can come in,

212
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:52.279
你們知道嗎﹖獨立戰爭后我們根本不應該放松﹗

213
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:52.279
You know what? We should have
never let up after the Revolution!


214
00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:54.782
坐下，坐吧，要咖啡嗎﹖

215
00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:54.782
Sit down, Sit down, Coffee?

216
00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:58.952
我們不該把你留在懸崖上，
我們應該把你推進海里


217
00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:58.952
We shouldn't have left you at toehold,
We should have driven you to the sea!


218
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.209
我听說你威脅要用AK-47掃射這個地方...

219
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.209
Now,,, what's this l hear
about you making threats


220
00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:08.379
...是怎么回事﹖

221
00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:08.379
to spray this place with an AK-47?

222
00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:10.464
什么﹖

223
00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:10.464
What?

224
00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:16.637
噢，噢，噢，不是的，那個...
我只是開個玩笑


225
00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:16.637
Oh, oh, oh, No, That,,,
l was just making a joke,


226
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.807
哦，你認為很有趣﹖殺死這里的所有人﹖

227
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.807
Oh, that's funny to you?
Killing everyone in this office?


228
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.605
不，不不不，是...
保羅說我從未發過火...


229
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.605
No, No, No, no, no, no, The,,,
Paul said how l never get angry,,,


230
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.191
那么你嘲笑侏儒的事又怎么講﹖

231
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.191
And what about you
making fun of midgets?


232
00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:31.026
我從未嘲笑過侏儒

233
00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:31.026
l never made fun of midgets,

234
00:06:31.068 --> 00:06:33.404
你說跟一個侏儒約會會很有趣

235
00:06:31.068 --> 00:06:33.404
You said it'd be fun to date one

236
00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:35.531
因為那樣你就可以把啤酒擱在她的頭上

237
00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:35.531
because then you could rest
your beer on her head,


238
00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:37.825
不，不，我從來沒有說過這种話

239
00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:37.825
No, No, l never said anything like that,

240
00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:40.744
很顯然漢德森認為你說了

241
00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:40.744
Apparently Henderson thinks you did,

242
00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:44.081
我一向很有幽默感，不過你這种笑話
不但不好笑而且很不健康


243
00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:44.081
Now l've got a good sense of humor,
but that's just plain sick,


244
00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:46.959
- 但是，先生，我沒有說過...
- 奧德莉﹖


245
00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:46.959
- But, sir, l didn't say,,,
- Audrey?


246
00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:50.796
- 我叫你拿哪份文件﹖
- 嗯，普拉特那份﹖


247
00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:50.796
- Which file did l ask you for?
- Uh, the Platt file?


248
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.258
- 約翰.普拉特，不是山姆.普拉特
- 對不起，是我沒有想...


249
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.258
- John Platt, Not Sam Platt,
- l'm sorry, l guess l didn't think that,,,


250
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:56.093
沒錯，你不用腦子想

251
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:56.093
That's right, You didn't think,

252
00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:59.221
現在，要是不太麻煩你的話，
能不能把正确的那份文件拿給我﹖


253
00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:59.221
Now if it's not too much trouble,
if you could fetch me the right file,,,


254
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.515
- 好的
- 順便給我和湯姆拿些炸圈餅


255
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.515
- OK,
- And get Tom and me some doughnuts,


256
00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:02.975
好的

257
00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:02.975
OK,

258
00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:07.730
听說你一直想見我...

259
00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:07.730
Now,,, l'm told you've been trying
to schedule a meeting with me


260
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:11.275
...想談談你的构思，是什么构思﹖

261
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:11.275
about some ideas, 
What are they?

262
00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:16.280
噢，嗯...是的，我是...是有一些构思

263
00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:16.280
Oh, uh,,, yeah, l had-l had some ideas,

264
00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:21.535
- 咖啡有問題﹖
- 噢，沒有，很好喝


265
00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:21.535
- Something wrong with the coffee?
- Uh, no, lt's fine,


266
00:07:21.618 --> 00:07:24.079
- 那你為何作出這么一副表情﹖
- 什么﹖


267
00:07:21.618 --> 00:07:24.079
- Why'd you make a face?
- What?


268
00:07:24.163 --> 00:07:27.458
噢，這個...咖啡有一點苦，不過...

269
00:07:24.163 --> 00:07:27.458
Oh, well,,, lt's-it's a little bitter, but,,,

270
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.922
- 見鬼，奧德莉，給我進來﹗
- 先生，真的，沒...沒什么大不了的


271
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.922
- Jesus, Audrey, get in here!
- Sir, really, it's f,,, lt's not a problem,


272
00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:36.717
- 我打的嗝味道都比這個好
- 先生，沒關系的


273
00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:36.717
- l've burped up stuff better than this,
- Sir, it's fine,


274
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.845
- 有什么問題嗎﹖
- 你嘗嘗湯姆的咖啡


275
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.845
- ls something wrong?
- Taste Tom's coffee,


276
00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:42.306
不用了，真的，沒關系

277
00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:42.306
No, really, lt's OK,

278
00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:47.603
- 你認為如何﹖
- 嗯，是不太好喝


279
00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:47.603
- How would you rate that?
- Well, it's not that great,


280
00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:53.400
不太好喝﹖我想是不太好喝，
湯姆覺得根本就難以下咽


281
00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:53.400
Not that great? l guess so,
Tom thinks it's shit,


282
00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:56.612
奧德莉，你是不是弱智﹖

283
00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:56.612
Audrey, are you retarded?

284
00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:59.948
我不是反問你。你是弱智嗎﹖

285
00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:59.948
lt's not a rhetorical question,
Are you retarded?


286
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.991
不，我不是弱智

287
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.991
No, l'm not retarded,

288
00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:05.537
因為一個弱智的人都能泡咖啡，
我說得對嗎﹖湯姆﹖


289
00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:05.537
Because a retarded person can make
a cup of coffee, Am l right, Tom?


290
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:07.956
噢，我...我不太...真的不太清楚

291
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:07.956
Oh, l,,, l don't-l don't really know much

292
00:08:07.998 --> 00:08:10.584
對于殘障人士的缺陷

293
00:08:07.998 --> 00:08:10.584
about the limitations
of the handicapped,


294
00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:15.964
我知道有一家職業介紹所，可以推荐殘障人士
來工作，薪水是每小時4美元


295
00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:15.964
l know of an employment agency that
hires out retarded people for $4 an hour,


296
00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:20.594
所以，如果泡杯咖啡對你來說都太難了的話，
班尼特小姐...


297
00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:20.594
So, if making a cup of coffee is too
difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,


298
00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:23.722
或許你該告訴我一聲，我好聯系那家職介所...

299
00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:23.722
perhaps you'd be good enough to let
me know, and l'll contact this agency


300
00:08:23.806 --> 00:08:27.351
...找一名殘障人士來做這份工作

301
00:08:23.806 --> 00:08:27.351
and give a retarded person a job,

302
00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:30.938
哇

303
00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:30.938
(mouths)) Wow,

304
00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:37.027
- 我剛才對她不會太嚴厲吧，嗯﹖
- 嗯，她的确不夠老練


305
00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:37.027
- l wasn't too rough on her, was l?
- Well, she is new and all,


306
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:40.406
或許我是太過分了，但是你知不知道
我所面臨的是什么樣的問題﹖


307
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:40.406
Maybe l was out of line, But do you
understand what l'm dealing with?


308
00:08:40.489 --> 00:08:44.201
我是說，我正要找人填補創意部的一個空缺職位

309
00:08:40.489 --> 00:08:44.201
l mean, here l am trying
to fill a position in Creative,


310
00:08:44.243 --> 00:08:48.998
可是我好像找不到一個足夠
可靠的人來獲取我的信任


311
00:08:44.243 --> 00:08:48.998
and l can't seem to find one person
responsible enough to earn my trust,


312
00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:52.418
有時候我甚至不知道這里到底
有沒有人知道自己在做什么


313
00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:52.418
l sometimes wonder if anyone here
even knows what they're doing,


314
00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:54.253
我能夠理解你為什么會有這种看法，
先生，不過...


315
00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:54.253
l can understand how you
could see it that way, sir, but,,,


316
00:08:54.336 --> 00:08:57.131
所以你認為我剛才并不過分﹖

317
00:08:54.336 --> 00:08:57.131
So you don't think
l was out of line?

318
00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:03.095
嗯，如果你要說的是，一個公司...

319
00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:03.095
Well, if what you're saying
is that a company


320
00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:06.098
...的強大程度受制于公司內部最薄弱的環節，
這是有道理的，不過...


321
00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:06.098
is only as strong as its weakest link,
that makes sense, but,,,


322
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:08.434
太對了，完全正确

323
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:08.434
Exactly, That's exactly right,

324
00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:10.894
一個公司的強大程度受制于
公司內部最薄弱的環節


325
00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:10.894
A company is only as strong
as its weakest link,


326
00:09:10.978 --> 00:09:12.896
- 是...
- 奧德莉，進來﹗


327
00:09:10.978 --> 00:09:12.896
- Yeah,,,
- Audrey, get in here!


328
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.940
你說得對，湯姆，我對她太溫柔了

329
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.940
You were right, Tom,
l was too soft on her,


330
00:09:15.024 --> 00:09:16.191
- 什么﹖不是
- 什么事﹖


331
00:09:15.024 --> 00:09:16.191
- What? No,
- Yeah?


332
00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.193
奧德莉，在跟湯姆詳細商討之后...

333
00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.193
Audrey, after talking it over
with Tom here,


334
00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:21.280
我認識到我必須要讓你离開了

335
00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:21.280
l've come to realize that
l'm gonna have to let you go,


336
00:09:21.363 --> 00:09:24.158
- 你要解雇我﹖﹗
- 抱歉，只能這樣子了


337
00:09:21.363 --> 00:09:24.158
- You're firing me?!
- l'm sorry, lt's just not working out,


338
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.160
- 但是，先生，我剛才是建議...
- 我對工作盡心盡責


339
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.160
- But, sir, l was suggesting,,,
- l take my job very seriously,


340
00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:28.412
一根鏈條的牢固程度受制于它的最薄弱的環節

341
00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:28.412
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link,


342
00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:31.623
- 沒錯，但問題還有完全不同的另一面
- 謝謝你在一旁加油添醋


343
00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:31.623
- Right, but there's a whole other side,
- Thanks for the support,


344
00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.917
奧德莉，今天下班之前清空你的辦公桌

345
00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.917
Audrey, empty out your desk
by the end of the day,


346
00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.003
- 好
- 先生，這...我...


347
00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.003
- Fine,
- Sir, this,,, l,,,


348
00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:37.755
多謝你幫我理清這個問題，湯姆

349
00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:37.755
Thanks for straightening me
out there, Tom,


350
00:09:37.796 --> 00:09:40.215
是的，是的，但是我剛才沒有
表達出我真正想說的東西


351
00:09:37.796 --> 00:09:40.215
Right, right, But l didn't get to say
what l wanted to say,


352
00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:44.928
噢，你的构思，當然了，
找我的新秘書給你安排一次會面吧


353
00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:44.928
Oh, your ideas, of course, Schedule
an appointment with my new secretary,


354
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.272
湯姆，你還好嗎﹖

355
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.272
Tom, Are you OK?

356
00:09:55.314 --> 00:09:58.192
嗯...是，當然

357
00:09:55.314 --> 00:09:58.192
Uh,,, yeah, sure,

358
00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:00.194
看到你的樣子，我猜他今天早上又對某個人...

359
00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:00.194
l'm guessing by the way
you look he's on another one


360
00:10:00.277 --> 00:10:01.570
...暴跳如雷了吧

361
00:10:00.277 --> 00:10:01.570
of his rampages this morning,

362
00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:03.906
- 絕對是
- 真是的


363
00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:03.906
- Definitely,
- Damn,


364
00:10:03.947 --> 00:10:05.407
我原本還希望能碰上他情緒好的時候

365
00:10:03.947 --> 00:10:05.407
l was hoping to catch him
in a good mood,


366
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:09.620
這個，嗯...很可能不會有這种時候了

367
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:09.620
Yeah, that's, um,,,
that's probably not gonna happen,


368
00:10:09.662 --> 00:10:12.289
我今晚要去參加一個派對，
可是我老爸要我留在家里...


369
00:10:09.662 --> 00:10:12.289
l'm supposed to go to this party tonight,
but my dad's making me housesit


370
00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:14.458
...照看他那只蠢鳥，
就因為他自己這個周末要出去


371
00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:14.458
for his stupid bird while
he's away this weekend,


372
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:17.127
為何你不進去告訴他你不想留在家里﹖

373
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:17.127
Well, why don't you go in there
and tell him you're not gonna do it?


374
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:18.962
我不能就這么...

375
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:18.962
l can't just,,,

376
00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:22.216
你不能就什么﹖我的意思是，為何不過你
自己要過的生活，享受一個自在的周末﹖


377
00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:22.216
You can't just what? l mean, live your
own life and have a free weekend?


378
00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:25.219
不，不是那么回事

379
00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:25.219
No, it's not that,

380
00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:29.181
- 沒錯，就是這么回事
- 對了


381
00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:29.181
- Wait, it is that,
- Yeah,


382
00:10:29.264 --> 00:10:32.977
- 我就應該去參加派對
- 對了，當然該這樣


383
00:10:29.264 --> 00:10:32.977
- l should just go to that party,
- Yeah, of course,


384
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:38.649
嗯...好了，我要回去...工作了

385
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:38.649
Well, um,,, OK, l'm gonna
go back to, uh, work,


386
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:40.859
好的

387
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:40.859
OK, sure,

388
00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:44.613
湯姆﹖我知道這可能有點唐突

389
00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:44.613
Tom? l know this might seem
a little out of place


390
00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:46.615
因為我們還只是剛剛認識

391
00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:46.615
because we barely
even know each other,


392
00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:49.326
不過，你今晚有什么安排嗎﹖

393
00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:49.326
But, do you have any plans tonight?

394
00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:51.996
沒有，沒，沒

395
00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:51.996
(mouths)) No, no, no,

396
00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:56.500
- 嗯...沒有，我...我有空得很
- 我們不會太晚回家的


397
00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:56.500
- Uh,,, no, l'm-l'm wide open,
- We won't be home too late,


398
00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.793
嘿，沒關系

399
00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.793
Hey, it's no problem,

400
00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.963
派對7點鐘開始，你能6點來我老爸家嗎﹖

401
00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.963
So the party starts at 7,
You could be at my dad's house by 6?


402
00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:02.673
- 沒問題
- 你确定你沒問題﹖


403
00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:02.673
- Sure,
- You sure you're cool with this?


404
00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:05.926
- 你開我玩笑﹖
- 湯姆，你真是太可愛了


405
00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:05.926
- Are you kidding me?
- Tom, you're such a sweetheart,


406
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.847
太謝謝你了，我真是愛死你了

407
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.847
Thank you so much,
l'm gonna love you forever for this,


408
00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:14.810
- 哈哈，我厲害吧﹖
- 你看﹖我怎么教你的﹖


409
00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:14.810
- All right, Yeah, who's the man now?
- See? What'd l tell you?


410
00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:18.689
(chuckles)) l'm a lady-killer,

411
00:11:15.852 --> 00:11:17.689
我是個情圣

412
00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:25.154
他怎么會對照看房子這么激動﹖

413
00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:25.154
How the hell could he be
so excited about housesitting?


414
00:11:25.195 --> 00:11:29.450
他人好，爸爸，就這么簡單，
絕大多數男孩根本不會愿意做這种事


415
00:11:25.195 --> 00:11:29.450
He's nice, Daddy, That's how,
Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that,


416
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:32.077
我不太确定我要不要讓他照看我的鳥

417
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:32.077
l don't know if l want him
around my bird,


418
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:36.206
噢，爸爸，你放松點行不行﹖
沒事的，我保証，行了嗎﹖


419
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:36.206
Oh, Dad, will you just relax?
lt's gonna be fine, l promise, OK?


420
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.044
我一到那邊就打電話回來查問，8點鐘的時候

421
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.044
l'll check in as soon
as l get there, 8:00,

422
00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:43.464
如果我覺得有什么不對勁，
你就得回家里來


423
00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:43.464
lf l sense anything's wrong,
you're coming back here,


424
00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:45.507
行了，行了

425
00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:45.507
OK, OK,

426
00:11:55.434 --> 00:11:58.437
(. light rock)

427
00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.349
很好，很准時

428
00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.349
Very good, Right on time,

429
00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:40.312
噢，先生，嗯...嘿，那個是熊夾子嗎﹖

430
00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:40.312
Oh, sir, Uh,,, 
Hey, is that a bear trap?

431
00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:44.692
是的，防止鄰居家的小孩進入我的院子

432
00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:44.692
Yes, lt's to keep the neighbor's kids
out of my yard,


433
00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:56.704
先生，我只想告訴你，我有多么感謝你

434
00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:56.704
Sir, l just wanted to let you know
how much l appreciate you,,,


435
00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:59.415
嗯...今晚的這一切

436
00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:59.415
well,,, letting tonight happen,

437
00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:05.087
我知道今晚的派對對麗莎很重要，
我認為你做得很正确


438
00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:05.087
l mean, l know it means a lot to Lisa,
and l think you're doing the right thing,


439
00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.631
我不知道你有什么圖謀，斯坦菲爾德

440
00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.631
l don't know what
you're planning, Stansfield,


441
00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:11.260
但你的態度弄得我很緊張

442
00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:11.260
but you're attitude
is making me very nervous,


443
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.432
- 襪子是干淨的，是嗎﹖
- 嗯...


444
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.432
- Those socks are clean, right?
- Um,,,


445
00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:21.520
- 你猶豫了，穿上鞋套
- 你說真的﹖


446
00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:21.520
- You hesitated, Put those on,
- Are you serious?


447
00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:34.450
如果要看電視，遙控器在這

448
00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:34.450
lf you want to watch TV,
the remote's there,


449
00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:37.494
那個面板控制燈、警報、天窗，等等

450
00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:37.494
That panel controls the lights,
alarm, skylight, etc,


451
00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:39.246
知道了，或許我一個都用不上

452
00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:39.246
Yeah, l probably won't
use any of that stuff,


453
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.541
- 你知道的，派對是7點鐘開始
- 派對﹖


454
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.541
- You know, since the party starts at 7,
- Party?


455
00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:46.295
我跟麗莎說得很清楚，
你在這里不能有任何客人


456
00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:46.295
l made it clear to Lisa you're not
to have any guests in here,


457
00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:49.673
你是唯一被允許呆在這所房子里的人

458
00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:49.673
You're the only one
allowed in the house,


459
00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:55.596
- 什么﹖麗莎不在這﹖
- 不在，當然不在


460
00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:55.596
- What? Lisa's not here?
- No, Of course not,


461
00:13:56.513 --> 00:13:59.683
麗莎去參加派對...

462
00:13:56.513 --> 00:13:59.683
Lisa's at the party,,,

463
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.520
而我留在這里

464
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.520
and l'm staying here,

465
00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:07.650
這一點對你而言這么難以理解﹖斯坦菲爾德﹖

466
00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:07.650
ls this concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?


467
00:14:09.985 --> 00:14:12.946
別碰家具

468
00:14:09.985 --> 00:14:12.946
Don't touch the furniture,

469
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:19.078
這是我的鳥的房間

470
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:19.078
And this is my bird's room,

471
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:22.539
他有自己的房間﹖

472
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:22.539
(chuckles)) He's got his own room?

473
00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.211
很酷

474
00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.211
That's cool,

475
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.425
我的小寶貝怎么樣﹖

476
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.425
- (gasps))
- How's my little boy?


477
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:38.639
- 他叫OJ
- OJ﹖跟那個殺人犯的名字一樣﹖


478
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:38.639
- This is OJ,
- OJ? Like the murderer?


479
00:14:38.722 --> 00:14:43.686
不，是跟那個橄欖球手的名字一樣，OJ.辛普森

480
00:14:38.722 --> 00:14:43.686
No, Like the football player,
OJ Simpson,


481
00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:46.981
我已經調好鬧鐘，
你一听到它響起，就給他喂食


482
00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:46.981
l've set the alarm,
When you hear it go off, feed him,


483
00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:50.901
哇，給這些小家伙喂食什么﹖

484
00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:50.901
- (mice squeaking))
- Aw, What do l feed these little guys?


485
00:14:50.943 --> 00:14:56.991
它們不用喂食，它們是食物，
他的食譜很丰富，不過它們是他最愛的食物


486
00:14:50.943 --> 00:14:56.991
They don't get fed, They are the food,
His diet varies, but they're his favorites,


487
00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:59.702
嘿，這些門你都不用關﹖

488
00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:59.702
Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

489
00:14:59.743 --> 00:15:03.372
不再需要了，自從他的配偶死后，
他就一直很消沉


490
00:14:59.743 --> 00:15:03.372
Not anymore, He's been depressed
since his mate died,


491
00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:07.543
他不飛了，只是坐在他的籠子里

492
00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:07.543
He won't fly, Just sits in his cage,

493
00:15:10.254 --> 00:15:15.259
藥，10點鐘給他吃兩顆

494
00:15:10.254 --> 00:15:15.259
Medication, Give him two
of these at 1 0:00,


495
00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:17.469
我必須把這些塞進他的喉嚨﹖

496
00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:17.469
l have to shove these down his throat?

497
00:15:17.553 --> 00:15:21.140
只要塞一顆，另一顆塞入他的直腸

498
00:15:17.553 --> 00:15:21.140
Just one, The other is inserted
into his rectum,


499
00:15:21.223 --> 00:15:23.225
別擔心，這不會讓他太難受的

500
00:15:21.223 --> 00:15:23.225
Don't worry, lt's not
too unpleasant for him,


501
00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:28.522
- 他不咬人吧，會不會﹖
- 不會，除非你逗他


502
00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:28.522
- He doesn't bite, does he?
- No, Not unless you taunt him,


503
00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:30.065
你沒打算逗他吧，嗯﹖湯姆﹖

504
00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:30.065
You're not planning on taunting him,
are you, Tom?


505
00:15:30.107 --> 00:15:31.608
- 沒有
- 我認為，那种行為真的很病態


506
00:15:30.107 --> 00:15:31.608
- No,
- l mean, that'd be really sick,


507
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.986
沒有，當然沒有

508
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.986
No, of course not,

509
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.198
還有最重要的一點，務必要給他喝夠一品脫的水

510
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.198
And the most important thing,
make sure he gets a pint of water,


511
00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.659
藥物會使他脫水，他就會呼吸困難

512
00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.659
The medication tends to dry him out
and then he can't breathe,


513
00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:42.953
- 好的
- 好了，我該走了


514
00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:42.953
- OK,
- Well, l must be off,


515
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:46.081
- 漢德森應該還等在外面
- 漢德森﹖我以為你解雇他了


516
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:46.081
- Henderson should be waiting outside,
- Henderson? l thought you fired him,


517
00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:48.250
因為他的构思很愚蠢﹖當然不會

518
00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:48.250
Because his ideas were stupid?
Of course not,


519
00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.252
他要開車送我去火車站

520
00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.252
He's gonna drive me to the train station,

521
00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:53.922
等麗莎和漢斯一回來你就可以走了

522
00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:53.922
So, you can leave as soon
as Lisa and Hans get back,


523
00:15:53.964 --> 00:15:56.300
- 漢斯﹖
- 麗莎的男朋友


524
00:15:53.964 --> 00:15:56.300
- Hans?
- Lisa's boyfriend,


525
00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:01.472
記住，嗯...碗里的水、藥，還有...

526
00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:01.472
So remember, uh,,, water in the bowl,
medication, and,,,


527
00:16:01.555 --> 00:16:05.726
我不在的時候這間房子發生任何事，我唯你是問

528
00:16:01.555 --> 00:16:05.726
anything happens to this house
while l'm gone, l'll kill you,


529
00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:09.938
(door shuts))

530
00:16:10.022 --> 00:16:12.399
你在照看房子﹖你開我玩笑吧

531
00:16:10.022 --> 00:16:12.399
(Paul over phone)) You're housesitting?
You gotta be kidding me.


532
00:16:12.483 --> 00:16:13.609
我知道，真是見鬼了

533
00:16:12.483 --> 00:16:13.609
(Tom)) l know, it sucks,

534
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:16.570
你在說什么呀﹖你不懂嗎﹖這是一次考驗

535
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:16.570
What are you talking about?
Don't you see? This is a test.


536
00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:18.989
你照看好泰勒的房子，又提出了不少好构思

537
00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:18.989
You watch Taylor's house,
come up with a couple of great ideas


538
00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:20.991
如果一切都順利，你就能升職了

539
00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:20.991
and if everything goes smooth,
you get the promotion.


540
00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:24.161
- 你這樣認為﹖
- 當然了，還有更容易的方法嗎﹖


541
00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:24.161
- You think so?
- Of course I do. What could be easier?


542
00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:25.996
(crackles))

543
00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:29.124
(. ''Not What I Wanted'' by Evan Olson))

544
00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:43.973
你干什么呀，漢斯﹖快過來

545
00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:43.973
(Lisa giggling)) What are you
doing, Hans? Come here.


546
00:16:44.014 --> 00:16:48.644
寶貝，如果你不立刻讓我給你
擦上這個，你會晒傷的


547
00:16:44.014 --> 00:16:48.644
Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you
don't let me put this on you right now.


548
00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:58.445
噢，天吶，你嚇到我了，漢斯，
你是個神經病，快放下來


549
00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:58.445
Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans.
You're insane. Put that down.


550
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.742
想給我擦嗎﹖幫我擦點防晒劑

551
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.742
Want to put some on me?
Put some lotion on me.


552
00:17:10.457 --> 00:17:14.211
- 杰克在嗎﹖
- 嘿...什么﹖你是誰﹖


553
00:17:10.457 --> 00:17:14.211
- ls Jack around?
- Hey,,, what? Who are you?


554
00:17:14.294 --> 00:17:18.340
別緊張，我是萊德.泰勒，
杰克的儿子，我從后門進來的


555
00:17:14.294 --> 00:17:18.340
lt's OK, l'm Red Taylor, l'm Jack's son,
l let myself in the back,


556
00:17:18.382 --> 00:17:20.467
- 噢，嘿，我是湯姆.斯坦菲爾德
- 嘿


557
00:17:18.382 --> 00:17:20.467
- Oh, Hey, Tom Stansfield,
- Hey,


558
00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:24.013
湯姆，幸會，我打攪你了嗎﹖

559
00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:24.013
Tom, nice to meet you,
Am l interrupting something here?


560
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:29.310
噢，不，嗯...我剛...嗯...噢，你的鞋

561
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:29.310
Oh, no, Uh,,, l was,,, uh,,,
Oh, your shoes,


562
00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:33.605
是耐克鞋，嗯，听著，湯姆，
你能幫我個忙嗎﹖我的電視指南不見了


563
00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:33.605
Nike, Uh, listen, Tom, can you
do me a favor? l lost my TV Guide.


564
00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:37.693
我過來看看我老爸這會不會還有一份

565
00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:37.693
l came over here to see if maybe
my dad's got a copy of one,


566
00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:40.279
你沒看到哪里有電視指南嗎﹖有沒有﹖

567
00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:40.279
You haven't seen a copy of
the guide laying around, have you?


568
00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:43.073
- 我妹妹在嗎﹖
- 不在，她出去參加派對了


569
00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:43.073
- My sister in?
- No, actually she's out for the evening,


570
00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:46.744
- 找到了
- 噢


571
00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:46.744
- Bingo, (chuckles))
- Oh,


572
00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:50.539
那么，嗯，你來這里是...

573
00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:50.539
So, uh, you're here to,,,

574
00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:53.417
- 照看房子
- 噢


575
00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:53.417
- Housesit,
- Oh,


576
00:17:54.293 --> 00:17:59.089
對了，或許最好別告訴麗莎我順道來過這里

577
00:17:54.293 --> 00:17:59.089
Yeah, it's probably for the best if you
don't, uh, tell Lisa that l stopped by,


578
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:03.344
- 為什么﹖有什么問題嗎﹖
- 你知道她有多保守啦


579
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:03.344
- Why? ls there a problem?
- Well, you know how uptight she is,


580
00:18:03.427 --> 00:18:06.430
- 是嗎﹖
- 我是這個家里比較不受傳統約束的人


581
00:18:03.427 --> 00:18:06.430
- Really?
- l'm more the free spirit of the family,


582
00:18:07.431 --> 00:18:12.186
噢，噢，老兄，看到這個了嗎﹖

583
00:18:07.431 --> 00:18:12.186
Oh, Oh, boy, See that right there?

584
00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.272
- 克絲蒂.艾莉﹖
- 是的，我和她的女仆約會過


585
00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.272
- Kirstie Alley?
- Yeah, l dated her maid,


586
00:18:16.607 --> 00:18:19.443
- 真的﹖
- 我剝光了克絲蒂.艾莉的女仆


587
00:18:16.607 --> 00:18:19.443
- Really?
- l boned Kirstie Alley's maid,


588
00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:22.363
而且是在他們拍攝《看誰在說話》期間
（《看誰在說話》由約翰.屈伏塔/
布魯斯.威利斯/克絲蒂.艾莉主演）


589
00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:22.363
And this is while they were
making Look Who's Talking ,


590
00:18:22.446 --> 00:18:24.239
哇哦，真了不起

591
00:18:22.446 --> 00:18:24.239
Wow, that's really something,

592
00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:27.117
我再跟你說件事，你知道米歇爾.菲佛嗎﹖

593
00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:27.117
l'll tell you another thing,
You know Michelle Pfeiffer?


594
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:28.243
知道

595
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:28.243
Yeah,

596
00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:31.288
我干過米歇爾.菲佛的表妹

597
00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:31.288
l did the deed
with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin,


598
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.415
- 哇哦
- 就在那外面的矮樹叢中


599
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.415
- Wow,
- Right out there in those bushes,


600
00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:35.793
- 厲害
- 啊，她長得就跟米歇爾一模一樣


601
00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:35.793
- Right,
- Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,


602
00:18:35.834 --> 00:18:37.920
除了她是黑發而不是金發

603
00:18:35.834 --> 00:18:37.920
except she was brunette
instead of blond,


604
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:40.381
還有她比較矮比較胖

605
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:40.381
and she was kinda short and dumpy,

606
00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:44.009
噢，你真是有著多姿多彩的生活，萊德

607
00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:44.009
Well, uh, ya certainly have
an interesting life, Fred,


608
00:18:44.093 --> 00:18:46.220
你結婚了嗎﹖湯姆﹖

609
00:18:44.093 --> 00:18:46.220
You married, Tom?

610
00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:48.931
- 沒有，我還是單身
- 沒有女朋友﹖


611
00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:48.931
- No, l'm single,
- No girlfriend?


612
00:18:48.973 --> 00:18:52.935
沒有，不是，實際上我有過女朋友，
不過，嗯，我們分手了


613
00:18:48.973 --> 00:18:52.935
No, and, no, actually l had a girlfriend,
but we, uh, broke up,


614
00:18:53.018 --> 00:18:54.311
- 啊
- 啊


615
00:18:53.018 --> 00:18:54.311
- Ah,
- Ah,


616
00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:58.482
听著，我真的要工作了，
既然你找到了電視指南...


617
00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:58.482
Listen, l really gotta get back to work,
and since you got your TV Guide and,,,


618
00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:02.987
那么你們分手了﹖太糟糕了

619
00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:02.987
So, you broke up, huh? 
That's too bad,

620
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.780
- 你的前女友漂亮嗎﹖
- 是的


621
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.780
- Was your ex a looker?
- Yeah,


622
00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.991
是的，在我看來她挺漂亮的

623
00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.991
Yeah, in my opinion she was,

624
00:19:07.074 --> 00:19:11.495
我敢打賭你的皮夾里還留著她的照片

625
00:19:07.074 --> 00:19:11.495
l bet you you still keep a picture
of her in your wallet,


626
00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:14.206
- 是啊，我是留著
- 能看看嗎﹖


627
00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:14.206
- Yeah, l do,
- Can l see it?


628
00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.958
- 好吧，我想可以
- 太好了


629
00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.958
- Yeah, l suppose,
- OK,


630
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.836
讓我在皮夾里找一找，這就是她

631
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.836
Let me find her
in here, There she is,

632
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:22.798
噢﹗湯姆，你真是個幸運的家伙﹗

633
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:22.798
(laughing)) Oh!
Tom, you lucky man!


634
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.093
- 是啊
- 噢，她的屁股真是迷人﹗


635
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.093
- Yeah,
- Oh, she is a real piece of ass!


636
00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:29.638
噢，我可以干她的后花園干一整天﹗

637
00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:29.638
Oh, l could knock on that back door
all day long!


638
00:19:29.722 --> 00:19:32.182
- 是嗎﹖她...她是個漂亮的女孩
- 哇哦


639
00:19:29.722 --> 00:19:32.182
- Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl,
- Wow,


640
00:19:32.224 --> 00:19:35.269
她的床上功夫一定很行﹗
告訴我她的床上功夫很行吧，湯姆


641
00:19:32.224 --> 00:19:35.269
She has gotta be wicked in bed,
Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom,


642
00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:37.479
我敢打賭每天夜里她都干得你的
小弟弟皮開肉綻


643
00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:37.479
l bet you she banged your johnson raw
every single night,


644
00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:39.356
- 好了...
- ...因為這真是一個漂亮的姑娘


645
00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:39.356
- OK,,,
- ,,,'cause that is one fine-looking broad,


646
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.066
夠了，嘿﹗你...

647
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.066
All right, Hey! Would ya--

648
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.528
我...你在說的是我的女朋友

649
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.528
l me-
- You're talking about my girlfriend,

650
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.073
- 前女朋友，你說的
- 沒錯，但還是，這個...


651
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.073
- Ex-girlfriend, you said,
- Yeah, but still, it's,,,


652
00:19:48.157 --> 00:19:51.618
拜托，我只是找點話題，
你知道的，男人間的閑聊


653
00:19:48.157 --> 00:19:51.618
Come on, l'm just making conversation,
You know, guy-talk,


654
00:19:51.702 --> 00:19:54.288
听著，我只是...我覺得不自在...

655
00:19:51.702 --> 00:19:54.288
Look, l just,,, l don't feel comfortable

656
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:58.167
...跟一個完全陌生的人談論我的性關系

657
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:58.167
talking about my intimate relationships
with a complete stranger,


658
00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:00.336
理解

659
00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:00.336
Understood,

660
00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:03.672
你知道嗎，如果要問你在談論性時有多保守

661
00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:03.672
Well, you know, given how uptight
you are talking about sex,


662
00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:05.507
你差不多已經給出了答案

663
00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:05.507
you pretty much
answered the question,


664
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:07.926
我不保守﹗拜托﹗

665
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:07.926
l am not uptight! OK?

666
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.221
就因為我不愿意公開關于我前女友的性習慣...

667
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.221
Just because l don't feel like
revealing personal details


668
00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:15.142
...的這些個人隱私，并不能說明我保守

669
00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:15.142
about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits
does not make me uptight,


670
00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:17.686
我沒問你任何私人問題

671
00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:17.686
l didn't ask you anything personal,

672
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.731
是嗎，那你認為他媽的什么才是私人問題﹖

673
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.731
Well, then, what the hell
do you consider personal?


674
00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:24.443
這個，比如，你知道的，
如果我問你的那根棒子有多大


675
00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:24.443
Well, it'd be like, you know,
if l asked you how big your rod was,


676
00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:27.071
那么我就是百分之百的問過頭了

677
00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:27.071
Then l would be
out of line, 1 00%%%,

678
00:20:27.154 --> 00:20:31.867
不，不﹗這不比問我的女友是不是欲女更糟﹗

679
00:20:27.154 --> 00:20:31.867
No, no! That is no worse than
asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph,


680
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:34.662
我只是問你她喜不喜歡性

681
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:34.662
l just asked you if she dug sex,

682
00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:37.081
而且，如果我知道她是性冷感我就不會問了

683
00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:37.081
Besides, l wouldn't have asked
if l'd known she was frigid,


684
00:20:37.164 --> 00:20:39.708
她不是性冷感﹗

685
00:20:37.164 --> 00:20:39.708
Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

686
00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:41.752
你到底走不走﹖

687
00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:41.752
Are you leaving?

688
00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:43.253
噢，對了

689
00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:43.253
Oh, yeah,

690
00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:45.422
還有，能不能幫個忙﹖

691
00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:45.422
And listen, Could you do me a favor?

692
00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.007
- 不是什么大事
- 什么事﹖


693
00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.007
- lt's no big deal,
- What?


694
00:20:47.091 --> 00:20:50.719
我老爸的一個商業合伙人會過來取這個

695
00:20:47.091 --> 00:20:50.719
A business associate of my dad's
is gonna come by to pick this up,


696
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:55.891
- 是冰凍牛排，是份禮物
- 不冷呀


697
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:55.891
- lt's frozen steaks, it's a gift,
- lt's not cold,


698
00:20:57.434 --> 00:21:00.604
老爸說那家伙就是喜歡這個，你會怎么做﹖

699
00:20:57.434 --> 00:21:00.604
Dad says that's the way the guy
likes 'em, What are you gonna do?


700
00:21:00.688 --> 00:21:02.564
會幫我給他嗎﹖

701
00:21:00.688 --> 00:21:02.564
Will you give it to him?

702
00:21:02.606 --> 00:21:04.733
(doorbell)

703
00:21:04.775 --> 00:21:06.777
請稍等

704
00:21:04.775 --> 00:21:06.777
Just one second,

705
00:21:07.444 --> 00:21:09.780
(doorbell)

706
00:21:13.534 --> 00:21:14.952
- 奧德莉
- 湯姆


707
00:21:13.534 --> 00:21:14.952
- Audrey,
- Tom,


708
00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:16.412
走吧﹗快﹗

709
00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:16.412
(man)) Let's go! Come on!

710
00:21:16.453 --> 00:21:19.540
噢，這就對了，你跟他住在一起﹖

711
00:21:16.453 --> 00:21:19.540
Oh, l guess this makes sense,
He's got you living with him now?


712
00:21:19.623 --> 00:21:21.875
噢，不是，我只是在照看他的地方

713
00:21:19.623 --> 00:21:21.875
- Uh, no, l'm just watching his place,
- (car horn))


714
00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:24.712
- 他...杰克出了城
- 是嗎﹖


715
00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:24.712
- He's,,, Jack's out of town,
- He is?


716
00:21:24.795 --> 00:21:27.506
- 是的
- 噢，見鬼﹗


717
00:21:24.795 --> 00:21:27.506
- Yeah,
- Aw, shoot!


718
00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:30.050
我過來是希望討回我的工作

719
00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:30.050
l came by 'cause l was
hoping to get my job back,


720
00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:31.719
就是你害我失去的那份工作

721
00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:31.719
You know, the one that
you got me canned from


722
00:21:31.802 --> 00:21:33.387
只因為我泡了一杯難喝的咖啡﹖記得嗎﹖

723
00:21:31.802 --> 00:21:33.387
'cause l made a bad cup
of coffee? Remember that?


724
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.763
听著，我真的很抱歉

725
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.763
Listen, l'm really sorry about that,

726
00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:37.141
你怎么能只因為某個人
泡了一杯難喝的咖啡就解雇他，嗯﹖


727
00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:37.141
How can you fire someone
for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?


728
00:21:37.182 --> 00:21:38.475
我明白，這也正是我想跟他說的

729
00:21:37.182 --> 00:21:38.475
l know, That's what l
tried to say to him,

730
00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:41.895
你以為你是誰﹖他媽的Juan Valdez﹖
（Juan Valdez，哥倫比亞的咖啡品牌）

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:41.895
l mean, who do you think you are -
Juan fucking Valdez?


732
00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:42.229
l might have had a future at that place
if you'd just give me half a chance,


733
00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:45.229
只要你給我一半机會，說不定我就能
在那個地方干出些名堂來


734
00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:49.236
- 我們快走吧，挂包﹗
- 噢，天吶，是我那笨蛋男朋友


735
00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:49.236
- (man)) Let's get a move on, saddlebag!
- Oh, my God, That's my idiot boyfriend,


736
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.240
省口气吧，你這變態﹗

737
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.240
- (car horn))
- Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!


738
00:21:53.324 --> 00:21:55.701
老天，我快被他逼瘋了

739
00:21:53.324 --> 00:21:55.701
God, He drives me crazy,

740
00:21:55.784 --> 00:21:58.996
噢，嘿，既然你踩到地毯上了，
介不介意穿上這個﹖


741
00:21:55.784 --> 00:21:58.996
Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the
rug, would you mind putting these on?


742
00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:03.125
- 這些是醫用...我也穿了的
- 噢﹗甘草糖


743
00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:03.125
- They're medical,,, l got 'em on, too,
- Ugh! Licorice,


744
00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:06.503
我最恨甘草糖了，給我水，不然要吐了﹗

745
00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:06.503
l hate licorice, l need water
or l'm gonna throw up, Ugh!


746
00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:10.507
拜你所賜，我一個月內就失去了第二份工作，
現在是完全一文不名了


747
00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:10.507
Thanks to you, l lost my second job
inside a month and now l'm flat broke,


748
00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:11.967
你還丟過一份工作﹖

749
00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:11.967
You lost another job?

750
00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:14.762
是的，上禮拜五我剛丟了我的女服務生工作

751
00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:14.762
Yeah, l got fired from my waitress job
just last Friday,


752
00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.514
- 他們為什么解雇你﹖
- 噢，我不知道


753
00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.514
- Why did they fire you?
- Oh, l don't know,


754
00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:20.100
一個助理經理逮到我和顧客搞關系

755
00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:20.100
One of the assistant managers
caught me making out with a customer,


756
00:22:20.184 --> 00:22:21.852
- 什么﹖
- 嗯，實際上這個顧客...


757
00:22:20.184 --> 00:22:21.852
- Excuse me?
- Well, l mean, actually the customer


758
00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.354
...是我的男朋友

759
00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.354
was my boyfriend,

760
00:22:23.437 --> 00:22:25.856
我是說，我被解雇之后他成了我的男朋友

761
00:22:23.437 --> 00:22:25.856
l mean, he became my boyfriend
after the incident anyway,


762
00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:28.692
- 你這里有啤酒嗎﹖
- 嗯...嘿


763
00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:28.692
- You got any beer in here?
- Uh,,, Hey,


764
00:22:28.776 --> 00:22:31.195
- 找到了
- 穿上這個行嗎﹖


765
00:22:28.776 --> 00:22:31.195
- Here we go,
- Would you mind putting these on?


766
00:22:31.278 --> 00:22:34.490
這是這間房子里的規矩，哦，實際上，
這個規矩是很怪...呀...﹗


767
00:22:31.278 --> 00:22:34.490
lt's a house rule, Oh, actually,
that's a twist,,, Aah!


768
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:39.286
這是柜台﹗听著，
杰克是個真正的偏執狂，這樣就好了


769
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:39.286
That's the counter, Listen, Jack,
is just a real stickler, That'd be great,


770
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.830
別說笑了，今天上午我就發現這一點了

771
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.830
No kidding, l found that out this morning,

772
00:22:41.914 --> 00:22:43.499
我發誓，我要發瘋了，我要沖進去...

773
00:22:41.914 --> 00:22:43.499
(man)) l swear l am gonna freak out
and l'm gonna come in there,,,


774
00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:45.626
- 噢，老兄，斯派克真的發怒了
- 啊...


775
00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:45.626
- Oh, man, Spike's in a real mood,
- Uh,,,


776
00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:47.002
甚至不...嘿

777
00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:47.002
- Don't even,,, hey,

778
00:22:47.044 --> 00:22:48.879
- 快點，快點，快點，見鬼
- 我對天發誓，奧德莉


779
00:22:47.044 --> 00:22:48.879
- Come on, come on, come on, Shit,
- (Spike)) l swear to God, Audrey,


780
00:22:48.962 --> 00:22:51.715
我要在這家伙的門前尿尿﹗

781
00:22:48.962 --> 00:22:51.715
l'll piss on this guy's front steps!
Let's go!


782
00:22:51.757 --> 00:22:52.800
- (knocking))
- (doorbell)


783
00:22:52.883 --> 00:22:56.053
你不立刻給我開門，我就撞進來...

784
00:22:52.883 --> 00:22:56.053
lf you don't open this door this second,
l'm gonna come in there and,,,


785
00:22:56.136 --> 00:22:57.137
嗨

786
00:22:56.136 --> 00:22:57.137
- Hi,
- (burps))


787
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:58.472
別擔心，沒摔碎東西

788
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:58.472
- (clatter)
- Don't worry, Nothing broke,


789
00:22:58.555 --> 00:23:02.685
嘿，寶貝，出來，你把我一個人
留在見鬼的車里，自己在做什么﹖


790
00:22:58.555 --> 00:23:02.685
Hey, Baby, come on, What are you
doing leaving me in the goddamn car?


791
00:23:02.726 --> 00:23:04.353
搖起你的屁股，寶貝，快點，我們該上路了

792
00:23:02.726 --> 00:23:04.353
Shake that tail, baby,
Come on, Let's get a move on,


793
00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:08.190
- 急什么，斯文點行不行﹖
- 奧德莉﹗


794
00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:08.190
- Hold your horses, Try acting civilized,
- Audrey!


795
00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:09.566
這是湯姆，我跟你說過的辦公室里那家伙

796
00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:09.566
This is Tom, the guy that l was
telling you about from the office,


797
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.568
噢，那個咖啡小子

798
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.568
Oh, the coffee dude,

799
00:23:11.652 --> 00:23:14.405
你以后會遭惡報的，超級怪胎﹗

800
00:23:11.652 --> 00:23:14.405
You got some black ass karma
headed your way, superfreak,


801
00:23:14.488 --> 00:23:17.408
噢，我們不需要你的說教，大人物﹗

802
00:23:14.488 --> 00:23:17.408
Oh, we don't need no lecture
from you, Mr, High and Mighty,


803
00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:20.744
嘿，閉上你的鳥嘴，小女人，
小心我把你扔到牆外


804
00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:20.744
Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little
lady, before l bounce you off the wall!


805
00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:25.124
听著，如果你愿意到外邊去吵，
我會感激不盡，拜托


806
00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:25.124
Look, l would appreciate it
if you would take this outside, please,


807
00:23:25.207 --> 00:23:30.004
嘿，如果你愿意出去給自己買個面包圈，
我會感激不盡，猶太佬


808
00:23:25.207 --> 00:23:30.004
Hey, l'd appreciate it if you'd go
and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy,


809
00:23:30.087 --> 00:23:32.840
猶太佬﹖我不是猶太人，而且我不認為取笑...

810
00:23:30.087 --> 00:23:32.840
Jewy? l'm not Jewish, And l don't
think that making fun of the,,,


811
00:23:32.923 --> 00:23:36.218
- 別理他，他是瘋子
- 我是瘋子﹖


812
00:23:32.923 --> 00:23:36.218
- Don't pay attention to him, He's nuts,
- l'm nuts?


813
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.804
- 你以為你還能是誰﹖
- 听著，我們能不能到外邊去吵﹖


814
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.804
- Who do you think you are?
- Look, can we please take this outside?


815
00:23:38.887 --> 00:23:40.306
噢，算了吧

816
00:23:38.887 --> 00:23:40.306
Oh, come on,

817
00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:43.100
你知道你是什么東西嗎﹖
你是個肮臟的妓女


818
00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:43.100
You know what you are?
You're a filthy, little tramp,


819
00:23:43.142 --> 00:23:44.601
我﹖那你和你那個女服務生又是什么呢﹖

820
00:23:43.142 --> 00:23:44.601
Me? What about you and that waitress?

821
00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:46.729
- 繼續走
- 我從未碰過她


822
00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:46.729
- Keep going,
- l never touched her ever,


823
00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:48.689
- 你發誓﹖
- 我敢對天發誓


824
00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:48.689
- Swear?
- So help me God,


825
00:23:48.772 --> 00:23:50.190
你敢用你媽媽的性命發誓﹖

826
00:23:48.772 --> 00:23:50.190
You swear on your mama's life?

827
00:23:50.274 --> 00:23:52.234
見鬼，我才不會用我媽媽的性命發誓

828
00:23:50.274 --> 00:23:52.234
Hell, woman, l ain't gonna
swear on my mama's life,


829
00:23:52.276 --> 00:23:55.112
- 為什么不﹖如果你說的是真話
- 我覺得他說的是真話，奧德莉


830
00:23:52.276 --> 00:23:55.112
- Why not? lf you're telling the truth,
- l think he's telling the truth, Audrey,


831
00:23:55.195 --> 00:23:56.572
那你為什么不用你媽媽的性命發誓﹖

832
00:23:55.195 --> 00:23:56.572
Then why won't you swear
on your mama's life?


833
00:23:56.613 --> 00:23:59.325
因為我覺得我沒有權利...

834
00:23:56.613 --> 00:23:59.325
Well, because l don't feel
like l have the right


835
00:23:59.408 --> 00:24:00.909
...拿我媽媽的性命來冒險，這就是為什么

836
00:23:59.408 --> 00:24:00.909
to gamble with my mama's life,
that's why,


837
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.287
冒險﹖但是你顯然沒什么可擔心的...

838
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.287
Gamble? But apparently
you got nothing to worry about


839
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.080
...除非你象塊腐肉一樣在撒謊

840
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.080
unless you're lying like
a hunk of morgue meat,


841
00:24:05.122 --> 00:24:09.585
嘿，我不想呆在這里被個婊子罵作大話王﹗

842
00:24:05.122 --> 00:24:09.585
Hey, l ain't gonna sit here and get
called a liar by no skankin' whore!


843
00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:12.963
你說誰是婊子﹖你這小蝦米雞巴的混蛋﹗

844
00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:12.963
Who you calling a whore,
you shrimp-dick bastard?!


845
00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:14.089
奧德莉，現在是你在激怒他了

846
00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:14.089
Audrey, see now
you're just provoking him,


847
00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:15.591
你這是惡意中傷的、完完全全的、
厚顏無恥的謊言﹗你明明知道﹗


848
00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:15.591
That's a vicious, flat-out,
bold-faced lie and you know it!


849
00:24:15.632 --> 00:24:18.886
- 是嗎﹖是嗎﹖我不這樣認為﹗
- 我現在就把雞巴亮出來﹗


850
00:24:15.632 --> 00:24:18.886
- ls it? ls it? l don't think so!
- l'll whip it out right now!


851
00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:20.220
- 不，不，不，我不想看
- 我現在就把雞巴亮出來...


852
00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:20.220
- No, no, no, l don't wanna see it,
- l'm gonna whip it out right now


853
00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:22.931
...証明給你看她是個說謊的婊子﹗

854
00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:22.931
and prove to you
that she's a lying slut!

855
00:24:22.973 --> 00:24:24.808
- 把你的那坨肉留在褲襠里吧﹗
- 你要看我的家伙嗎﹖


856
00:24:22.973 --> 00:24:24.808
- Keep your meat in the fridge!
- You wanna see my piece?


857
00:24:24.892 --> 00:24:27.227
- 好了，好了﹗夠了﹗
- 找把尺子來，湯姆﹗你去拿...


858
00:24:24.892 --> 00:24:27.227
- All right, All right! That is enough!
- Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get,,,


859
00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:30.856
夠了﹗我對你是不是小蝦米雞巴不感興趣﹗

860
00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:30.856
That is it, l don't care
if you have a tiny shrimp dick!


861
00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:36.987
- 或者你有巨鯨雞巴，那個...
- 他媽的，奧德莉﹗


862
00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:36.987
- Or a giant whale dick, which that's,,,
- Goddamn it, Audrey!


863
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.990
你跟他說是你在說謊，否則我砸爛你的臉，
我發誓﹗


864
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.990
You tell him you're a liar or l'm gonna
smash your face in, l swear!


865
00:24:40.074 --> 00:24:45.245
- 等一下﹗放下這東西﹗
- 好了，我們能不能只用拳頭﹖


866
00:24:40.074 --> 00:24:45.245
- Wait a minute! You put that down!
- All right, Can we please just use fists?


867
00:24:45.329 --> 00:24:48.207
- 滾過來，你這小...
- 你打我，混蛋﹗


868
00:24:45.329 --> 00:24:48.207
- Come here, you little,,, (slap))
- You hit me, you bastard!


869
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.834
- 我沒有打你，你胡說﹗
- 他打我﹗


870
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.834
- l did not and you know it!
- He hit me!


871
00:24:50.918 --> 00:24:52.961
他明明打了我，就像我明明站在這﹗

872
00:24:50.918 --> 00:24:52.961
He hit me as sure
as l'm standing right here!


873
00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:54.672
- 你打了她﹖斯派克﹖
- 是的


874
00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:54.672
- Did you hit her, Spike?
- Yes,


875
00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:56.590
用手掌，只是用手掌

876
00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:56.590
With an open hand,
lt was with an open hand,


877
00:24:56.674 --> 00:24:58.008
- 用手掌又如何﹖
- 你不能...


878
00:24:56.674 --> 00:24:58.008
- So what if it's open?
- You can't,,,


879
00:24:58.092 --> 00:24:59.551
- 用手掌不算打
- 誰說的﹖


880
00:24:58.092 --> 00:24:59.551
- Then it don't count,
- Says who?


881
00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:02.513
任何人都這么說，你問這個猶太佬

882
00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:02.513
Says anyone, Ask the Jew,

883
00:25:02.596 --> 00:25:05.015
好了，夠了，你們兩個都該离開了

884
00:25:02.596 --> 00:25:05.015
All right, that's it,
You two have got to leave,


885
00:25:05.057 --> 00:25:07.601
行，沒問題，但是她休想和我一起走

886
00:25:05.057 --> 00:25:07.601
All right, that's fine,
But she is not coming with me,


887
00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:09.019
不歡迎你和我一起雙人行

888
00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:09.019
You are not welcome in the double ride,

889
00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:12.523
好啊，我才不在乎，我才不要坐你那破車，
我要留在這里和湯姆一起


890
00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:12.523
Fine, l don't care, l don't need your lousy
trailer, l'll stay right here with Tom,


891
00:25:12.564 --> 00:25:14.191
- 行，你和湯姆一起
- 我就留在這里


892
00:25:12.564 --> 00:25:14.191
- Fine, Stay with Tom,
- l'll stay right here,


893
00:25:14.274 --> 00:25:19.947
等一等，哇哦，兩位，你們需要
設法解決這件事


894
00:25:14.274 --> 00:25:19.947
Wait a minute, Whoa, Guys, you need
to try to work this thing out,


895
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.701
- 他打了我﹗他打我屁股﹗
- 我知道，我知道


896
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.701
- He hit me! He knocked me on my can!
- l know, l know,


897
00:25:23.784 --> 00:25:28.372
不過畢竟只是用手掌，而且...

898
00:25:23.784 --> 00:25:28.372
Well, but it was with
an open hand after all, and,,,


899
00:25:28.455 --> 00:25:32.042
兩人間的關系總是有高潮有低潮的

900
00:25:28.455 --> 00:25:32.042
Relationships have their
ups and downs, you guys,


901
00:25:32.126 --> 00:25:33.961
你們不想毀了這份很不錯的...

902
00:25:32.126 --> 00:25:33.961
and you don't want to ruin this great,,,

903
00:25:34.044 --> 00:25:37.006
(yelping))

904
00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:42.428
噢，天吶，那只鳥，OJ﹗

905
00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:42.428
Oh, God, The bird, OJ!

906
00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:46.807
哦，我的天

907
00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:46.807
Oh, my God,

908
00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:52.855
(continues yelping))

909
00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:55.024
噢

910
00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:55.024
- (squeals))
- Oh,


911
00:25:56.567 --> 00:26:01.155
你敢回來湯姆會踢爆你屁股﹗快滾吧﹗

912
00:25:56.567 --> 00:26:01.155
You come back here or Tom's
gonna kick your butt! So take that!


913
00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:04.199
噢，我嚇得發抖了，寶貝﹗

914
00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:04.199
(revs engine)) Ooh, l'm shaking
in my boots, baby!


915
00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:06.744
看看他們兩個，OJ

916
00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:06.744
Look at those two, OJ,

917
00:26:06.785 --> 00:26:09.496
(phone ringing))

918
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.044
噢，我不是逃跑，笨蛋﹗

919
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.044
(Spike)) Oh, l ain't
running away, dummy!


920
00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:17.296
- 喂﹖
- 嗨，湯姆，你怎么樣﹖


921
00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:17.296
- Hello?
- (Lisa)) Hi, Tom. How are ya?


922
00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:21.258
- 嘿，麗莎，我很好，我很好

923
00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:21.258
- Hey, Lisa, l'm great, l'm great,
- (squawks))


924
00:26:22.092 --> 00:26:23.844
- 是OJ在叫嗎﹖
- 是的，是的


925
00:26:22.092 --> 00:26:23.844
- ls that OJ?
- Yeah, yeah.


926
00:26:23.927 --> 00:26:27.556
- 我們剛喝了點水
- 我已經有好几年沒听到他這樣尖叫了


927
00:26:23.927 --> 00:26:27.556
- We just had a little drink of water,
- l haven't heard him squawk in years,


928
00:26:27.598 --> 00:26:31.685
噢，是啊，他真是只瘋鳥，你知道的

929
00:26:27.598 --> 00:26:31.685
Oh, yeah,
He's quite the crazy bird, you know,


930
00:26:31.769 --> 00:26:34.229
是啊。總之，湯姆，我只想你知道...

931
00:26:31.769 --> 00:26:34.229
Yeah. Anyway, Tom,
I just wanted you to know


932
00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:37.399
今天晚上你讓我可以出來，
我真不知有多么感激你


933
00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:37.399
how much I appreciate
you helping me out tonight.


934
00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:40.778
不過今晚的派對結束后
我要去一個朋友那里睡


935
00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:40.778
But l'd like to crash at a friend's place
tonight after the party,


936
00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:44.073
如果我請求你今晚一整夜留下來，
你會不會覺得很恐怖﹖


937
00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:44.073
Would you think it was horrible if l asked
you to stay the whole night tonight?


938
00:26:44.114 --> 00:26:49.620
噢，嗯...我...我想你老爸不愿我留在這里

939
00:26:44.114 --> 00:26:49.620
Oh, well,,, l-l don't think your dad
would want me staying here,


940
00:26:49.703 --> 00:26:53.499
- 求你了﹖
- 好吧，我想我會留下來


941
00:26:49.703 --> 00:26:53.499
- Please?
- Yeah, l suppose l could stay,


942
00:26:53.582 --> 00:26:56.168
謝謝了，湯姆，我真的很感激你，
明天見


943
00:26:53.582 --> 00:26:56.168
Thanks, Tom. I really appreciate it.
See you tomorrow. (hangs up))


944
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.463
我不怕你，湯姆當然也不怕你﹗

945
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.463
(Audrey)) l ain't afraid of you and Tom
sure as hell ain't scared neither!


946
00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:03.509
笨蛋﹗沒用的家伙﹗

947
00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:03.509
Butthead! Loser!

948
00:27:04.385 --> 00:27:05.678
(tires screeching))

949
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:10.307
噢，謝天謝地，他終于走了，
嘿，我今晚留在這行嗎﹖


950
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:10.307
Oh, my God, Thank God he's gone,
Hey, so is it OK if l stay here tonight?


951
00:27:10.391 --> 00:27:14.186
噢，這...這又不是我的房子

952
00:27:10.391 --> 00:27:14.186
Oh, man, it's,,, it's not even my house,

953
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:16.188
噢，沒錯

954
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:16.188
Oh, yeah,

955
00:27:16.271 --> 00:27:18.649
算了，我也不想要什么施舍

956
00:27:16.271 --> 00:27:18.649
OK, Well, l sure as hell
don't want any charity,


957
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:23.070
我的意思是，你并不欠我什么，所以...

958
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:23.070
l mean, it's not like you
owe me anything, so,,,


959
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:25.364
今天在辦公室發生的事情我很抱歉

960
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:25.364
And l'm sorry about
that whole office thing,


961
00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:26.824
我知道你不想我被解雇

962
00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:26.824
l know that you didn't mean
to get me fired,


963
00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:31.829
- 是的，你不該被解雇
- 謝謝


964
00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:31.829
- Yeah, You didn't deserve to get fired,
- Thanks,


965
00:27:31.912 --> 00:27:33.956
好了

966
00:27:31.912 --> 00:27:33.956
OK,

967
00:27:33.998 --> 00:27:38.127
我想我只能出去找一間無家可歸者的收容所了

968
00:27:33.998 --> 00:27:38.127
Well, l guess l'll just go try
to find a homeless shelter then,


969
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.632
- 等一等
- 怎么﹖


970
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.632
- Wait a second,
- Yeah?


971
00:27:43.674 --> 00:27:45.551
天吶

972
00:27:43.674 --> 00:27:45.551
(sighs)) God,

973
00:27:45.634 --> 00:27:51.265
- 听著，我想你可以留下來
- 真的﹖噢，謝謝你，湯姆


974
00:27:45.634 --> 00:27:51.265
- Look, l suppose you can stay,
- Really? Oh! Thanks, Tom,


975
00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:53.350
你人最好了，噢，我會打掃廚房的，好嗎﹖

976
00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:53.350
You're the best, Oh, and l'll
clean up the kitchen, OK?


977
00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:56.395
- 好

978
00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:56.395

00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:13.537
(Tom)) Yeah, One second,

982
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.373
有人敲門

983
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.373
- (knocking))
- There's somebody at the door,


984
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.127
嗨，嗯，有什么事﹖

985
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.127
Hi, Uh, can l help you?

986
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.380
瓦克斯派我來取一個包裹

987
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.380
Vasquez sent me here
to pick up a package,


988
00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:27.009
噢，你是...對對對，

他媽的把包裹給我就行了
（奧普拉.溫弗莉，頭號脫口秀女主持人）


993
00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:31.889
What is this, Oprah ?
Just give me the goddamn package,


994
00:28:31.972 --> 00:28:35.768
噢，好的，對，嗯...

l think this is it,

998
00:28:39.104 --> 00:28:41.899
如果這東西不是真的，我就折斷他的拇指

999
00:28:39.104 --> 00:28:41.899
lf this ain't kosher,
l'm gonna break his thumbs,


1000
00:28:41.982 --> 00:28:45.944
噢，按照規定，包裹上面應該印有戳記

1001
00:28:41.982 --> 00:28:45.944
Oh, well, by law, it should be stamped
right on the package there,


1002
00:28:47.571 --> 00:28:51.408
怎么...

OJ,,, today's specials include

You son of a bitch,

00:29:21.605 --> 00:29:24.566
我逮到你了，伙計

1017
00:29:21.605 --> 00:29:24.566
- (chuckles)) l got you now, buddy,
- (squealing))


1018
00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:27.695
啊

1019
00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:27.695
(gasps)) Aah!

1020
00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:30.906
啊

1021
00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:30.906
Aah! (groans))

1022
00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:34.576
(squawks))

1023
00:29:34.618 --> 00:29:37.454
- 老兄，好酷啊
- 噢，老天


1024
00:29:34.618 --> 00:29:37.454
- Dude, that was cool,
- Oh, my God,


1025
00:29:38.288 --> 00:29:41.959
- 湯米，對那些古董溫柔點

1026
00:29:38.288 --> 00:29:41.959
- Tommy, easy on the antiques,
- (squawking))


1027
00:29:42.042 --> 00:29:45.754
- 那是只貓頭鷹﹖
- 沒錯，OJ跑了，他怎么會飛了﹖


1028
00:29:42.042 --> 00:29:45.754
- Was that an owl?
- Yes, OJ got out, How is he flying?


1029
00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:49.133
- 他是一只鳥
- 他...不，杰克說過他...


1030
00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:49.133
- Well, he is a bird,
- He,,, no, Jack said that he,,,


1031
00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:51.260
啊，見鬼﹗我得找到他

1032
00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:51.260
Aw, shit! l gotta find him,

1033
00:29:51.301 --> 00:29:55.014
別著急，也許他餓了會自己回來

1034
00:29:51.301 --> 00:29:55.014
Don't worry, He'll probably
come back when he's hungry,


1035
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:58.767
不，我得找到他，要不然我會失業﹗
你知道嗎﹖


1036
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:58.767
No, l have to find him or l'm gonna
lose my job! You know what?


1037
00:29:58.851 --> 00:30:01.937
這也是幫你討回工作的好机會

1038
00:29:58.851 --> 00:30:01.937
This isn't gonna help your chances
of getting your job back either,


1039
00:30:01.979 --> 00:30:03.397
好吧

1040
00:30:01.979 --> 00:30:03.397
OK,

1041
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.984
- 他死哪去了﹖
- 湯姆，放輕松點


1042
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.984
- Where the hell is he?
- Tom, relax,


1043
00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:09.570
放輕松﹖OJ跑了﹗
（注﹕習慣上把愛顯淑女派頭的女孩稱為OJ，
而loose有放蕩之義，所以"OJ's loose"這句話
引起身后三個女孩的誤會）


1044
00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:09.570
- Relax? OJ's loose!
- (gasping%screaming))


1045
00:30:09.653 --> 00:30:14.283
- 現在可沒時間輕松﹗
- 湯姆﹗他就在那﹗


1046
00:30:09.653 --> 00:30:14.283
- This is no time to relax!
- Tom! He's right over here!


1047
00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:16.952
- 那邊，那邊，那邊﹗
- OJ﹗


1048
00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:16.952
- Right there, right there, right there!
- OJ!


1049
00:30:16.994 --> 00:30:19.204
- 就在那﹗
- OJ﹗


1050
00:30:16.994 --> 00:30:19.204
- Right there!
- OJ!


1051
00:30:19.288 --> 00:30:23.459
站住﹗不，不，站住，別跑﹗

1052
00:30:19.288 --> 00:30:23.459
Stop! No, no, Stop, Stop,

1053
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.670
OJ，OJ...

1054
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.670
OJ, OJ,,,

1055
00:30:26.754 --> 00:30:31.091
站起來，你在我的地頭做什么﹖想打劫我﹖

1056
00:30:26.754 --> 00:30:31.091
Get up, What the hell you doing
on my property? Planning to rob me?


1057
00:30:31.175 --> 00:30:33.635
不，我...我只是在找...

1058
00:30:31.175 --> 00:30:33.635
No, l-l was just looking for,,,

1059
00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:38.182
是，是，我看見你在找的東西了，
你很喜歡年輕姑娘﹖


1060
00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:38.182
Yeah, yeah, l see what you're looking
for, You got a thing for young girls, eh?


1061
00:30:38.223 --> 00:30:39.433
不是

1062
00:30:38.223 --> 00:30:39.433
No,

1063
00:30:39.516 --> 00:30:41.977
那你為什么一直打量我老婆，你這變態﹖

1064
00:30:39.516 --> 00:30:41.977
Then why do you keep
eyeing my wife, you perv?


1065
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:44.480
你的...不，我沒有看，我...

1066
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:44.480
Your,,, no, l wasn't looking, l,,,

1067
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:47.524
亞瑟，你很快過來嗎﹖我需要你幫我

1068
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:47.524
Arthur, are you gonna be back soon?
l need you to spot me,


1069
00:30:47.566 --> 00:30:49.360
再等一會，寶貝

1070
00:30:47.566 --> 00:30:49.360
Just give me a minute, honey,

1071
00:30:49.443 --> 00:30:51.779
- 噢，請不要殺我
- 我不會殺你


1072
00:30:49.443 --> 00:30:51.779
- Oh,,, Please don't kill me,
- l'm not gonna kill you, OK,


1073
00:30:51.862 --> 00:30:56.075
只要你不殺我，我把我最值錢的東西給你，拿去

1074
00:30:51.862 --> 00:30:56.075
lf you let me live, l'll give you my
most valued possession, Here, take it,


1075
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:57.660
你知道這是什么嗎﹖

1076
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:57.660
You know what that is, don't you?

1077
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:00.663
- 伊万德.霍利菲爾德的耳朵
- 什么﹖


1078
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:00.663
- Evander Holyfield's ear,
- What?


1079
00:31:00.704 --> 00:31:04.249
就是被麥克.泰森咬下來的那一塊耳朵

1080
00:31:00.704 --> 00:31:04.249
The part of the ear that
Mike Tyson bit off and spit out,


1081
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:06.335
- 但這是白色的
- 那又如何﹖


1082
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:06.335
- But it's white,
- So?


1083
00:31:06.377 --> 00:31:11.131
- 不應該是黑色的嗎﹖
- 如果還長在他腦袋上，沒錯，應該是黑的


1084
00:31:06.377 --> 00:31:11.131
- So, shouldn't it be black?
- Well, if it's still on his head, sure,


1085
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:14.551
但誰都知道切下來的耳朵會褪色

1086
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:14.551
But anybody knows that a
severed ear loses its color,


1087
00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:16.303
- 才不會
- 謝樂爾?


1088
00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:16.303
- No,
- Sheryl?


1089
00:31:16.387 --> 00:31:18.514
- 什么事?
- 一只耳朵...


1090
00:31:16.387 --> 00:31:18.514
- Yeah?
- What happens to an ear


1091
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:22.851
- ...從你腦袋上切下來之后會怎么樣﹖
- 會變色


1092
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:22.851
- if it's severed from your head?
- lt changes color, Duh,


1093
00:31:22.893 --> 00:31:25.688
噢，見鬼﹗

1094
00:31:22.893 --> 00:31:25.688
- (thud)
- (Sheryl) Ow! Damn!


1095
00:31:25.729 --> 00:31:28.065
蒂娜，給我一瓶啤酒

1096
00:31:25.729 --> 00:31:28.065
- (Audrey)) Tina, give me a beer,
- (man laughs))


1097
00:31:28.107 --> 00:31:30.025
你肯定是耍我

1098
00:31:28.107 --> 00:31:30.025
- (Tina)) Oops,
- (man)) You have got to be kidding me,


1099
00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:32.611
- 再來一次
- 來吧，你們這些家伙﹗


1100
00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:32.611
- (Audrey)) Try another one,
- (Tina)) Come on, you guys!


1101
00:31:32.695 --> 00:31:34.905
開派對了﹗

1102
00:31:32.695 --> 00:31:34.905
- (clatter)
- (Tina)) Party!


1103
00:31:34.989 --> 00:31:38.033
- 來吧，我們開派對﹗
- 奧德莉...


1104
00:31:34.989 --> 00:31:38.033
- Come on, let's go!
- Audrey,,,


1105
00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:40.869
- 他媽的這里是怎么回事﹖
- 抬頭


1106
00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:40.869
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Heads up,


1107
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:41.912
這些人是誰﹖

1108
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:41.912
Who are these people?

1109
00:31:41.996 --> 00:31:44.748
我請了几個朋友來幫忙找貓頭鷹

1110
00:31:41.996 --> 00:31:44.748
l invited some friends over
to help us look for the owl,


1111
00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.583
德瑞爾還修好了客廳里的桌子

1112
00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.583
And Darryl even fixed
the table in the hall,


1113
00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:48.544
- 謝謝
- 杰克甚至不會發現桌子摔坏過的


1114
00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:48.544
- Thank you,
- He won't even know it was broken,


1115
00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:50.838
三不沾﹗

1116
00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:50.838
- (bottle breaks))
- (man)) Air ball,


1117
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:53.841
那個我們待會處理，各位，這是湯姆

1118
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:53.841
We'll get that later,
Everyone, this is Tom,


1119
00:31:53.924 --> 00:31:55.718
- 你好，湯姆
- 嗨，各位


1120
00:31:53.924 --> 00:31:55.718
- Yo, Tom,

1121
00:31:55.759 --> 00:31:57.177
各位，湯姆真是個好人，他的困難會...

1122
00:31:55.759 --> 00:31:57.177
You guys, Tom's a real good guy
and his nuts are gonna just,,,


1123
00:31:57.261 --> 00:31:59.596
奧德莉，能不能...

1124
00:31:57.261 --> 00:31:59.596
Audrey, could you,,,

1125
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.561
- 什么﹖
- 听著，我很感謝你的幫助


1126
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.561
- What?
- Listen, l appreciate all your help,


1127
00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:09.106
但是你能讓你的朋友呆在房子外頭嗎﹖

1128
00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:09.106
But could you make sure that your
friends stay out of the house?


1129
00:32:09.189 --> 00:32:12.985
- 他們所有人還是黑色那家伙﹖
- 不，是他們所有人


1130
00:32:09.189 --> 00:32:12.985
- All of them or just the colored guy?
- No, all of them,


1131
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:17.239
噢，這招真高，這樣那個黑色的家伙
就不會以為是針對他個人了


1132
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:17.239
Ooh, that's smart, That way the
colored guy won't take it personal,


1133
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:20.409
- 我根本就沒有針對...听著
- 什么﹖


1134
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:20.409
- l have nothing against,,, Look,
- What?


1135
00:32:20.492 --> 00:32:21.952
我有責任照看好這所房子

1136
00:32:20.492 --> 00:32:21.952
l am responsible for this house

1137
00:32:21.994 --> 00:32:24.747
我不能讓所有這些人在這里閑逛

1138
00:32:21.994 --> 00:32:24.747
and l can't have all of these
people hanging around,


1139
00:32:24.788 --> 00:32:28.334
好的，我明白了，各位，我們出去

1140
00:32:24.788 --> 00:32:28.334
OK, all right, l got it,
You guys, let's move it out,


1141
00:32:28.417 --> 00:32:31.086
- 啊，我才剛開始呢
- 好主意


1142
00:32:28.417 --> 00:32:31.086
- Aw, l was just getting started,
- Good idea,


1143
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.547
謝了，各位，太好了

1144
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.547
Thanks, guys, That's great,

1145
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.217
- 蛋糕怎么辦﹖
- 別緊張，他們都是好人


1146
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.217
- (Tina)) What about the cake?
- Don't worry, they're all good people,


1147
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:39.970
他們不會偷東西，也不會象印第安人一樣喝醉酒

1148
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:39.970
They're not gonna steal nothing
or drink too much like the lndians,


1149
00:32:40.054 --> 00:32:43.766
听著...務必要讓他們呆在外頭

1150
00:32:40.054 --> 00:32:43.766
Look,,, just make sure they stay outside,

1151
00:32:43.807 --> 00:32:46.352
- 好嗎﹖
- 好的


1152
00:32:43.807 --> 00:32:46.352
- OK?
- OK,


1153
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:53.067
(door opens%shuts))

1154
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.902
- 麗莎﹖
- 嗨，湯姆


1155
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.902
- Lisa?
- Hi, Tom,


1156
00:32:54.985 --> 00:32:58.113
啊，你回來了﹖你怎么回來了﹖

1157
00:32:54.985 --> 00:32:58.113
Uh, you're home? 
Why are you home?

1158
00:32:58.197 --> 00:33:01.283
不值得再提，我和漢斯大吵了一架

1159
00:32:58.197 --> 00:33:01.283
lt's not worth going into,

Oh, it's nothing,

1273
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.908
畫得真的很棒，我不知道你還是個畫家

1274
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.908
That is really good,
l didn't know you were an artist,


1275
00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:33.662
我以前畫畫，不過再也找不到朋友
愿意當我的裸体模特了


1276
00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:33.662
l used to be, but l couldn't get any more
of my friends to pose nude for me,


1277
00:36:33.746 --> 00:36:37.791
- 你不會有興趣吧，嗯﹖

1278
00:36:33.746 --> 00:36:37.791
- You wouldn't be interested, would you?

1279
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:41.337
你害羞了，我開玩笑的

You're blushing, l was just joking,

1281
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.591
我沒有害羞，是我...我的臉有時候會自己變紅

No, seriously, you should really
pursue this, l mean, you're good,


1287
00:36:52.097 --> 00:36:56.018

我老爸給我安排好的道路

l would, but it doesn't really fit in
with my father's plan for me,

Oh, Red,

1303
00:37:13.827 --> 00:37:15.788
- 哦，我爸告訴你了﹖
- 告訴我什么﹖


1304
00:37:13.827 --> 00:37:15.788
- Oh, so Dad told you?
- About what?


1305
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.540
- 禁制令
- 怎么回事﹖


1306
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.540
- The restraining order,
- How's that?


1307
00:37:18.624 --> 00:37:21.960
是的，萊德被禁止靠近我、靠近我爸
或靠近這所房子的100碼范圍


1308
00:37:18.624 --> 00:37:21.960
Yeah, Red's not allowed within

1309
00:37:22.044 --> 00:37:24.046
他...他沒有...他沒有提這件事

1310
00:37:22.044 --> 00:37:24.046
He,,, uh, he didn't-he didn't mention that,

1311
00:37:24.129 --> 00:37:27.591
萊德是個怪人。如果我爸發現任何人
進了這所房子，尤其是萊德


1312
00:37:24.129 --> 00:37:27.591
Red's a freak, You don't want
to be around my dad if he finds out


1313
00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:30.094
那個時候，你絕對不想呆在我爸身邊的

1314
00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:30.094
anyone was in this house,
especially Red,


1315
00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:31.887
好像萊德無論走到哪里都會制造麻煩

1316
00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:31.887
lt's like wherever he is, there's trouble,

1317
00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:34.098
有一次，我爸出城了，他趁机開了個大派對

1318
00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:34.098
l mean, one time, he had this big party
'cause Dad was out of town


1319
00:37:34.181 --> 00:37:35.474
結果我爸提早回來...

1320
00:37:34.181 --> 00:37:35.474
and my dad came home early,,,

1321
00:37:35.557 --> 00:37:39.687
嘿，哦...這個，既然老鼠跑了，
我們回房去好不好﹖


1322
00:37:35.557 --> 00:37:39.687
Hey, uh,,, you know, since the mouse is
gone, what say we, uh, go back inside?


1323
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.897
好的

1324
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.897
OK,

1325
00:37:41.981 --> 00:37:43.899
(grunts))

1326
00:37:43.941 --> 00:37:46.485
(both screaming))

(. synthesizer)

1328
00:38:08.799 --> 00:38:12.428
- 它還准備參加奧斯卡﹖我討厭它﹗
- 我知道﹗


1329
00:38:08.799 --> 00:38:12.428
- lt was up for an Oscar? l hated it!
- l know! (laughing))


1330
00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:16.765
噢，我討厭那部電影﹗老兄，我真不敢相信

1331
00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:16.765
Oh, l hated that movie!
Man, l can't believe you,


1332
00:38:16.807 --> 00:38:20.561
你像是...你跟你工作時候的樣子太不一樣了

1333
00:38:16.807 --> 00:38:20.561
You're like,,, you're so different
from how you are at work,


1334
00:38:20.644 --> 00:38:24.648
我該怎么做﹖穿著沃特.佩頓運動衫走來走去﹖

1335
00:38:20.644 --> 00:38:24.648
What am l gonna do? Like, walk around
with my Walter Payton jersey?


1336
00:38:24.732 --> 00:38:28.861
不，不，我懂，就像是，
工作的時候你必須是麗莎.泰勒﹕


1337
00:38:24.732 --> 00:38:28.861
No, no, l get it, lt's, like, at work
you have to be Lisa Taylor:


1338
00:38:28.944 --> 00:38:32.656
你知道的，一個對家族企業全心全意的員工

1339
00:38:28.944 --> 00:38:32.656
the, you know, loyal employee
to the family firm,


1340
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.158
而我必須是...湯姆...

1341
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.158
And l have to be,,, Tom,,,

1342
00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:38.912
湯姆.斯坦菲爾德﹕愿意為任何人做任何事的家伙

1343

Tom Stansfield: the guy
who will do anything for anybody,


1344
00:38:40.497 --> 00:38:42.458
沒錯，就是我

1345
00:38:40.497 --> 00:38:42.458
Yup, That's me,

1346
00:38:44.293 --> 00:38:47.296
真的，好像我可以和你聊任何事

1347
00:38:44.293 --> 00:38:47.296
l swear, it's like l can just
talk to you about anything,


1348
00:38:47.338 --> 00:38:50.007
我知道，确切地說，這...

1349
00:38:47.338 --> 00:38:50.007
l know, exactly, lt's,,,

1350
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.635
- 這有點瘋狂
- 是啊，是有點


1351
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.635
- Yeah, this is crazy,
- Yeah, it is,


1352
00:38:54.803 --> 00:38:59.642
我猜是因為咱倆互相沒有吸引力，知道嗎﹖

1353
00:38:54.803 --> 00:38:59.642
l guess it's because there's no
attraction between us, you know?


1354
00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:00.768
是

1355
00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:00.768
Yeah,

1356
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:03.604
這樣就不會有性壓力

1357
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:03.604
You know, there's none
of that sexual tension,


1358
00:39:03.687 --> 00:39:05.314
- 是的
- 你就像是我的女性朋友


1359
00:39:03.687 --> 00:39:05.314
- Yeah,
- lt's like l'm with a girlfriend,


1360
00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:07.524
- 很棒吧，是不是﹖
- 是的


1361
00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:07.524
- lt's great, isn't it?
- Yeah,


1362
00:39:07.608 --> 00:39:09.860
也許我們可以一起逛街、購物

1363
00:39:07.608 --> 00:39:09.860
l mean, maybe we could go to the mall
sometime and go shopping,


1364
00:39:09.902 --> 00:39:11.987
- 那樣一定很有趣﹗是不是﹖
- 是的


1365
00:39:09.902 --> 00:39:11.987
- That would be fun! Wouldn't it be fun?
- Yeah,


1366
00:39:12.029 --> 00:39:14.031
等一下，你該听听這首歌

1367
00:39:12.029 --> 00:39:14.031
Wait, you have to listen to this song,

1368
00:39:14.114 --> 00:39:16.241
來呀，我要跟人跳舞﹗

1369
00:39:14.114 --> 00:39:16.241
Come on, l need
someone to dance with!


1370
00:39:16.325 --> 00:39:18.702
你不會想看我跳舞的

1371
00:39:16.325 --> 00:39:18.702
- You don't want to see me dance,
- (. ''You Make Me Feel Like Dancing')


1372

- 來呀，和我一起跳
- 我完全不懂怎么跳


1373
00:39:18.786 --> 00:39:22.122
- Come on, dance with me,
- l have no idea what l'm doing,

來呀，把手握在一起，對了，現在轉圈

- C?


1379
00:39:28.045 --> 00:39:31.298
- Like that?
- Yeah! (squeals))


1380
00:39:31.382 --> 00:39:34.802
停一停，看我的，看我的

1381
00:39:31.382 --> 00:39:34.802
Hold on, hold on, 
Watch, watch, watch,

- C∴?..
- 我真是不自量力


1385
00:39:36.553 --> 00:39:39.848
- Yeah! Oh,,,
- l'm trying to do too much,


1386
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.185
噢﹗C?

1387
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.185
(laughing)) Oh! Yeah!

- l'm a dancer,


1390
00:39:46.063 --> 00:39:47.272
- 接著我
- 噢...干嘛﹖


1391
00:39:46.063 --> 00:39:47.272
- Catch me,

噢，我好喜歡這首歌

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.167
Oh, l love this song,

really wild strip routine

就算是你也會很欣賞的

lt's super sexy, Even you'd appreciate it,

我真希望能夠象她一樣，你知道嗎﹖
她是多么自由自在啊

1412
00:41:14.943 --> 00:41:16.945
覺得怎么樣﹖

1413
00:41:14.943 --> 00:41:16.945
So, what do you think?

1414
00:41:17.029 --> 00:41:21.992
哦，很...很好看

1415
00:41:17.029 --> 00:41:21.992
Ah, it's,,, it's, uh, very nice,

1416
00:41:22.076 --> 00:41:25.579
那么，要不是你是個同性戀，
這已經讓你興奮了，是嗎﹖


1417
00:41:22.076 --> 00:41:25.579
So if you weren't gay,
this would turn you on, right?


1418
00:41:26.455 --> 00:41:32.169
- 同性戀﹖誰說我是同性戀﹖
- 我老爸說的，你是說你不是﹖


1419
00:41:26.455 --> 00:41:32.169
- Gay? Who said l was gay?
- My father, You mean it's not true?


1420
00:41:32.252 --> 00:41:35.089
- 不是﹗
- 不是﹖天吶，太難為情了﹗


1421
00:41:32.252 --> 00:41:35.089
- No!
- No? God, l'm so embarrassed!


1422
00:41:35.172 --> 00:41:38.842
- 我不敢相信你害我做這种事﹗
- 我不是故意...我是說，嗯...


1423
00:41:35.172 --> 00:41:38.842
- l can't believe you'd let me do this!
- l didn't mean to,,, l mean, um,,,


1424
00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:41.261
為什么你爸爸說我是同性戀﹖

1425
00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:41.261
Why would your father say that l'm gay?

1426
00:41:41.345 --> 00:41:45.891
我不知道，不過，你不能完全怪他，
我的意思是，你确實有點女性化


1427
00:41:41.345 --> 00:41:45.891
l don't know, Well, you can't blame him
entirely, l mean, you are a little feminine,


1428
00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:48.644
別難過

1429
00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:48.644
- (gasps))
- Don't be hurt,


1430
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.231
沒關系的

1431
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.231
lt's OK,

1432
00:41:52.314 --> 00:41:55.025
漢斯也有點女性化

1433
00:41:52.314 --> 00:41:55.025
Hans is a bit of feminine, too,

1434
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:58.696
話說回來，漢斯到底做了什么﹖

1435
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:58.696
What exactly did Hans do anyway?

1436
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:02.616
倒不是他做了一件什么事

1437
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:02.616
Well, it's not like
he did just one thing,

1438
00:42:05.703 --> 00:42:07.955
而是信任的問題

1439
00:42:05.703 --> 00:42:07.955
lt's more about trust,

1440
00:42:08.038 --> 00:42:11.792
是的，信任是...是蠻重要的

1441
00:42:08.038 --> 00:42:11.792
Yeah, Trust is,,, it's important,

1442
00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:15.170
信任是最重要的

1443
00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:15.170
Trust is everything,

1444
00:42:15.254 --> 00:42:20.009
我不知道，也許是我的原因，
可能是我給人某种感覺


1445
00:42:15.254 --> 00:42:20.009
l don't know, Maybe it's me, lt's like
l'm just sending out some kind of vibe,


1446
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.553
- 象樣的男孩都不會喜歡我
- 不是的


1447
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.553
- l can't attract a decent guy,
- No,


1448
00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:24.763
- 我哪里不好﹖
- 你根本就用不著擔心


1449
00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:24.763
- What's wrong with me?
- Don't even worry about it,


1450
00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:27.933
你很快就會有新的男朋友

1451
00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:27.933
You're gonna find another guy so fast,

1452
00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:33.605
看看你自己，多么迷人啊

1453
00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:33.605
l mean, look at you, 
You're amazing,

1454
00:42:35.065 --> 00:42:39.403
- 你真這么想﹖
- 你以為今晚我為什么會來這里﹖


1455
00:42:35.065 --> 00:42:39.403
- You really think so?
- Why do you think l'm here tonight?


1456
00:42:40.988 --> 00:42:44.241
噢，天吶，湯姆

1457
00:42:40.988 --> 00:42:44.241
Oh, God, Tom,

1458
00:42:46.035 --> 00:42:49.121
原來你不知道，你以為是...

1459
00:42:46.035 --> 00:42:49.121
You didn't know, 
You thought that,,,

1460
00:42:50.414 --> 00:42:52.791
(door opens))

1461
00:43:00.758 --> 00:43:05.387
嗯...嗯...我要...我馬上回來

1462
00:43:00.758 --> 00:43:05.387
Uh,,, uh,,, l'm gonna,,, l'll be right back,

1463
00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:10.017
我出去一下，看看奧德莉是不是需要毛巾

1464
00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:10.017
l'm just gonna go and check
and see if Audrey needs towels,


1465
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.728
湯姆，你沒必要對我撒謊

1466
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.728
Tom, you don't have to lie to me,

1467
00:43:12.811 --> 00:43:16.523
如果你要上廁所，盡管去，快點回來就是了

1468
00:43:12.811 --> 00:43:16.523
lf you have to go to the bathroom,
go take a crap and come back,


1469
00:43:18.609 --> 00:43:20.569
(chuckles))

1470
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.616
(clatter)

1471
00:43:27.618 --> 00:43:31.205
怎么...嘿﹗見鬼，你在這里做什么，老兄﹖

1472
00:43:27.618 --> 00:43:31.205
What the,,, hey! What the hell
are you doing here, man?


1473
00:43:34.124 --> 00:43:35.125
(grunts))

1474
00:43:35.209 --> 00:43:39.380
你妄想從瓦克斯身上詐兩万塊錢，
居然還問我在做什么﹖


1475
00:43:35.209 --> 00:43:39.380
You try to bone Vasquez out of 20 grand
and you ask me what l'm doing?


1476
00:43:39.463 --> 00:43:43.592
你以為我是在“Mrs. Fields”干活嗎﹖
你以為我的老板喜歡烤餅干嗎﹖
（“Mrs. Fields”，著名曲奇餅干企業）


1477
00:43:39.463 --> 00:43:43.592
You think l work for Mrs, Fields? You
think my boss likes to bake cookies?


1478
00:43:44.385 --> 00:43:47.554
- 哇哦﹗你這是干什么﹖別這樣
- 你竟然賣面粉給我


1479
00:43:44.385 --> 00:43:47.554
- Whoa! What are you doing? Come on,
- You tried to sell me flour,


1480
00:43:47.638 --> 00:43:51.558
面粉﹖我...我根本就不知道你在說什么...
你在干什...別這樣﹗


1481
00:43:47.638 --> 00:43:51.558
Flour? l-l don't even know what
you're talk,,, What are you,,, Come on!


1482
00:43:51.642 --> 00:43:53.894
听著，我只是幫我老板照看房子的

1483
00:43:51.642 --> 00:43:53.894
Look, l'm just housesitting for my boss,

1484
00:43:53.978 --> 00:43:57.064
- 你老板是誰﹖
- 杰克.泰勒


1485
00:43:53.978 --> 00:43:57.064
- Who's your boss?
- Jack Taylor,


1486
00:43:57.147 --> 00:44:02.403
杰克.泰勒﹖我跟一個叫杰克.泰勒的
在Joliet一起坐過牢


1487
00:43:57.147 --> 00:44:02.403
Jack Taylor, huh? l did time
in Joliet with a Jack Taylor,


1488
00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:07.408
是不是中等身高、頭發不長不短、
屁股上生了嚴重的毛囊炎﹖


1489
00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:07.408
Average height, medium hair,
horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?


1490
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:10.995
- 我不可能知道他有沒有毛囊炎
- 我想你說了他是你老板


1491
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:10.995
- l wouldn't know about the folliculitis,
- l thought you said he was your boss,


1492
00:44:11.078 --> 00:44:14.123
- 沒錯
- 那你就從沒見過他屁股﹖


1493
00:44:11.078 --> 00:44:14.123
- He is,
- And you never saw his ass?


1494
00:44:14.206 --> 00:44:17.001
- 為什么我會見到我老板的屁股﹖
- 這是顯而易見的


1495
00:44:14.206 --> 00:44:17.001
- Why would l see my boss's ass?
- lt stands to reason,


1496
00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:20.462
你給一個人干久了活，遲早...

1497
00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:20.462
You work for a guy long enough,
sooner or later,


1498
00:44:20.504 --> 00:44:23.424
...有机會瞅到他的屁股

1499
00:44:20.504 --> 00:44:23.424
you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass,

1500
00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:27.094
听著，我...我不知道你是干哪行的

1501
00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:27.094
Listen, l-l don't know
what line of work you're in,


1502
00:44:27.177 --> 00:44:30.264
但是我從未見過我老板的屁股

1503
00:44:27.177 --> 00:44:30.264
but l've never seen my boss's ass,

1504
00:44:30.347 --> 00:44:33.183
嘿，老兄...

1505
00:44:30.347 --> 00:44:33.183
Hey, man,,,

1506
00:44:33.225 --> 00:44:35.978
嘿﹗嘿，住手，否則我要報警了﹗

1507
00:44:33.225 --> 00:44:35.978
Hey! Hey, stop it
or l'm gonna call the cops!


1508
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.648
跟他們說什么﹖說你的毒品買賣搞砸了﹖

1509
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.648
And tell them what?
Your drug deal went bad?


1510
00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:42.192
你敢出賣我，我就剁了你，象只火雞一樣

1511
00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:42.192
You rat me out, l'm gonna
carve you up like a turkey


1512
00:44:42.234 --> 00:44:44.945
再用剁剩下的你去砸你的小孩

1513
00:44:42.234 --> 00:44:44.945
and beat your kids
with what's left of you,


1514
00:44:45.029 --> 00:44:48.365
- 我沒有小孩
- 我可以等


1515
00:44:45.029 --> 00:44:48.365
- l don't have any kids,
- l can wait,


1516
00:44:48.407 --> 00:44:51.910
(. cell phone ringing
''Fur Elise'' by Beethoven))


1517
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:02.504
失陪。喂﹖沒錯，好的

1518
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:02.504
Excuse me, Hello? Right, OK,

1519
00:45:03.881 --> 00:45:06.175
湯米，別怪我沒說清楚

1520
00:45:03.881 --> 00:45:06.175
Tommy, let's get clear on something,

1521
00:45:06.216 --> 00:45:10.054
一個小時后，要么讓我拿到
瓦克斯付了錢購買的貨


1522
00:45:06.216 --> 00:45:10.054
ln the next 60 minutes, l'm gonna
bring Vasquez what he paid for


1523
00:45:10.095 --> 00:45:12.848
要么把你的卵蛋包好充數

1524
00:45:10.095 --> 00:45:12.848
or your gift-wrapped nuts,

1525
00:45:14.892 --> 00:45:16.852
(door shuts))

1526
00:45:19.396 --> 00:45:21.523
- 噢，嗨，湯姆，怎么了﹖
- 對，我正要問你


1527
00:45:19.396 --> 00:45:21.523
- Oh, hi, Tom, What's going on?
- Yeah, That's what l wanna know,


1528
00:45:21.607 --> 00:45:24.902
你老爸的禮物是怎么回事﹖
你看...看到那家伙沒有﹖


1529
00:45:21.607 --> 00:45:24.902
What's going on with your dad's gift?
See,,, Do you see that guy?


1530
00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:26.528
他要殺我﹗

1531
00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:26.528
He was gonna kill me!

1532
00:45:26.612 --> 00:45:28.530
你不覺得是你反應過度了一點嗎﹖湯姆﹖

1533
00:45:26.612 --> 00:45:28.530
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little, Tom?


1534
00:45:28.572 --> 00:45:33.577
反應過度﹖這家伙拿著把刀﹗
我可不覺得是我反應過度


1535
00:45:28.572 --> 00:45:33.577
Overreacting? The guy had a knife!
l don't think that l am overreacting!


1536
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:35.788
他可能只是找錯地址了

1537
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:35.788
He probably just had the wrong address,

1538
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:40.125
我是說，光在芝加哥就有不止一打人叫杰克.泰勒

1539
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:40.125
l mean, there's gotta be over a dozen
Jack Taylor's in Chicago alone,


1540
00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:43.587
我要進我爸的臥室了，
這家伙還來的話你叫我


1541
00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:43.587
l'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom,
You tell me if the guy shows up again,


1542
00:45:43.629 --> 00:45:45.214
行，有你的，你听著

1543
00:45:43.629 --> 00:45:45.214
All right, All right, 
You listen to me,

1544
00:45:45.297 --> 00:45:47.508
你根本就不應該出現在這所房子里

1545
00:45:45.297 --> 00:45:47.508
You're not even supposed
to be in this house,


1546
00:45:47.591 --> 00:45:48.550
誰說的﹖

1547
00:45:47.591 --> 00:45:48.550
Says who?

1548
00:45:48.634 --> 00:45:51.387
我知道禁制令的事了，萊德

1549
00:45:48.634 --> 00:45:51.387
l know about the restraining order, Red,

1550
00:45:51.428 --> 00:45:56.100
禁制令，我想那是個天大的誤會

1551
00:45:51.428 --> 00:45:56.100
Restraining-shmaining, l mean,
that's just a big misunderstanding,


1552
00:45:56.183 --> 00:45:57.810
湯姆﹗找到OJ了﹗

1553
00:45:56.183 --> 00:45:57.810
(Audrey)) Tom! lt's OJ!

1554
00:45:57.935 --> 00:45:59.895
(overlapping chatter)

1555
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.899
噢

1556
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.899
(Audrey and friends)) Oh,,,

1557
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:08.570
- 哇，嘿，你是誰﹖
- 我來找麗莎，我叫漢斯


1558
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:08.570
- Whoa, Hey, Who are you?
- l'm here to see Lisa, My name's Hans,


1559
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:12.199
- 讓你很震惊﹖
- 沒有


1560
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:12.199
- ls that so shocking?
- No,


1561
00:46:12.282 --> 00:46:13.909
怎么了，你很奇怪她跟我這樣的人約會﹖

1562
00:46:12.282 --> 00:46:13.909
What, you surprised she'd go out
with someone like me?


1563
00:46:13.993 --> 00:46:15.244
不，不，不是...

1564
00:46:13.993 --> 00:46:15.244
No, no, lt's not,,,

1565
00:46:15.285 --> 00:46:17.830
得了吧，老兄，你該感到羞恥

1566
00:46:15.285 --> 00:46:17.830
Give me a break, man,
You oughta be ashamed of yourself,


1567
00:46:17.913 --> 00:46:20.207
我告訴你，外面有大把的女孩...

1568
00:46:17.913 --> 00:46:20.207
Let me tell you something,
There are a lot of girls out there


1569
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.668
...不在乎我剛好...

1570
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.668
who can see past the fact
that l just happen to be,,,


1571
00:46:22.751 --> 00:46:24.211
...超重了几磅

1572
00:46:22.751 --> 00:46:24.211
a few pounds overweight,

1573
00:46:24.294 --> 00:46:26.755
你知道嗎，我的內心和別人是一樣的

1574
00:46:24.294 --> 00:46:26.755
(crying)) You know, inside
l'm just like everyone else,


1575
00:46:26.797 --> 00:46:29.925
- 我給你拿紙巾
- 謝謝


1576
00:46:26.797 --> 00:46:29.925
- Let me get you a tissue,
- Thank you,


1577
00:46:29.967 --> 00:46:32.136
- 今天是我重新開始節食的第二天
- 嘿，漢斯...


1578
00:46:29.967 --> 00:46:32.136
- l'm on the second day of a new diet,
- Hey, uh, Hans,,,


1579
00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:34.054
- 我連巧克力都不吃了
- 我真的很抱歉


1580
00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:34.054
- l gave up chocolate,
- l'm really sorry,


1581
00:46:34.138 --> 00:46:36.765
我想，嗯，我們之間只不過有個不太好的開始

1582
00:46:34.138 --> 00:46:36.765
l think that, uh, we just
got off on the wrong foot,


1583
00:46:36.807 --> 00:46:42.229
哦...很高興見到你，漢斯，我是湯姆

1584
00:46:36.807 --> 00:46:42.229
Oh,,, uh,,, lt's good
to meet you, Hans, l'm Tom,


1585
00:46:42.313 --> 00:46:43.522
我，嗯...

1586
00:46:42.313 --> 00:46:43.522
l, uh,,, (clears throat)

1587
00:46:43.605 --> 00:46:46.358
我是麗莎的...朋友

1588
00:46:43.605 --> 00:46:46.358
l'm just a friend of Lisa's,

1589
00:46:46.442 --> 00:46:49.528
哦，很好啊，或許你可以幫我，她在嗎﹖
麗莎﹗麗莎﹗


1590
00:46:46.442 --> 00:46:49.528
Oh, great, Well, maybe you can
help me, ls she here? Lisa! Lisa!


1591
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:51.196
哇哦，漢斯，跟你說

1592
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:51.196
Whoa, Hans, you know what?

1593
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.241
現在可能不是你見麗莎的好時机

1594
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.241
Maybe right now isn't a great time
for you to see Lisa,


1595
00:46:54.325 --> 00:46:56.410
怎么樣，要不要喝一杯﹖

1596
00:46:54.325 --> 00:46:56.410
What say, uh, we get you a drink?

1597
00:46:56.493 --> 00:46:59.330
噢，好吧，沒錯，她可能真的很生气

1598
00:46:56.493 --> 00:46:59.330
Oh, OK, Yeah, she's
probably really upset,


1599
00:46:59.413 --> 00:47:03.917
你知道嗎，今天晚上我和她之間有誤會，
結果她拂袖而去


1600
00:46:59.413 --> 00:47:03.917
You see, we got in a misunderstanding
tonight and, well, she left me,


1601
00:47:04.001 --> 00:47:06.086
- 哇哦，真不幸
- 是啊


1602
00:47:04.001 --> 00:47:06.086
- Wow, that's unfortunate,
- Yeah,


1603
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.005
是怎么回事﹖

1604
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.005
Uh, what happened?

1605
00:47:08.047 --> 00:47:12.301
哦...我想是因為她從背后看到我那樣
光著身子，有點被嚇到了


1606
00:47:08.047 --> 00:47:12.301
Well, l think seeing me naked from
behind like that kind of shocked her,


1607
00:47:12.343 --> 00:47:16.305
噢，那么，今晚是你們頭一次﹖

1608
00:47:12.343 --> 00:47:16.305
Oh, So, tonight was the first time,

1609
00:47:16.347 --> 00:47:19.141
是的，今晚是頭一次，真可怕

1610
00:47:16.347 --> 00:47:19.141
Yeah, Tonight was the first time,
lt was awesome,


1611
00:47:19.183 --> 00:47:22.353
我當時象這樣躺在床上，一條腿翹在空中

1612
00:47:19.183 --> 00:47:22.353
l mean, l was lying up on the bed like
this with one leg straight up in the air,


1613
00:47:22.436 --> 00:47:24.313
- 我想我不需要看...
- 我一只手這樣摸著屁股


1614
00:47:22.436 --> 00:47:24.313
- l don't think l really need to see,,,
- And l had a handful of ass right here,,,


1615
00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:25.356
- 哇哦
- ...另一只手握著這玩意（奶子）


1616
00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:25.356
- Whoa,
- ,,,and l had a handful of this,


1617
00:47:25.439 --> 00:47:29.068
漢斯，別這樣，哇哦，
老天，你...那個


1618
00:47:25.439 --> 00:47:29.068
Hans, please, Whoa,
God, you're,,, that's,,,


1619
00:47:29.693 --> 00:47:33.697
- 這個時候麗莎走了進來
- 什么﹖


1620
00:47:29.693 --> 00:47:33.697
- And that's when Lisa walked in,
- What?


1621
00:47:33.781 --> 00:47:36.492
她逮到我在和別的女孩鬼混

1622
00:47:33.781 --> 00:47:36.492
She caught me in
the bed with a blonde,

1623
00:47:36.533 --> 00:47:38.035
什么﹖

1624
00:47:36.533 --> 00:47:38.035
What?

1625
00:47:38.118 --> 00:47:40.829
噢，算了吧，老兄，
難道你從不想和女孩做這檔事﹖


1626
00:47:38.118 --> 00:47:40.829
Aw, come on, man, Tell me you
haven't ever wanted to do it with a,,,


1627
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:43.999
漢斯，漢斯，不是的...是你欺騙了她

1628
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:43.999
Hans, Hans, No,,, you cheated on her,

1629
00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:48.837
你知道嗎，湯姆﹖你說得對

1630
00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:48.837
You know something, Tom?
You're right,


1631
00:47:48.879 --> 00:47:53.676
噢，我猜那真的是欺騙，這下我要失去所有人了

1632
00:47:48.879 --> 00:47:53.676
Aw, l guess that was cheating,
And now l've gone and lost everyone,


1633
00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:56.345
一開始我就應該知道這是不對的

1634
00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:56.345
l should have known
from the start it wasn't right,


1635
00:47:56.387 --> 00:47:58.889
她一直跟我說我讓她想起她老爸

1636
00:47:56.387 --> 00:47:58.889
She kept telling me
l reminded her of her dad,


1637
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.976
漢斯，你必須認識到你們之間
已經完蛋了，你知道嗎﹖


1638
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.976
Hans, you gotta realize
that this is over, you know?


1639
00:48:02.059 --> 00:48:05.646
你應該做個了斷，然后...然后繼續前進

1640
00:48:02.059 --> 00:48:05.646
And you gotta put an end to it,
and-and move on,


1641
00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:09.149
- 去一個更好的地方，知道嗎﹖
- 對


1642
00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:09.149
- And get yourself to a better place, OK?
- Yes,


1643
00:48:09.233 --> 00:48:13.362
- 我想你明白我的意思
- 是的，我确實明白你的意思


1644
00:48:09.233 --> 00:48:13.362
- l think you know what l mean,
- Yeah, l do know what you mean,


1645
00:48:13.404 --> 00:48:17.491
我准備好了，我知道我該怎么做了

1646
00:48:13.404 --> 00:48:17.491
And l'm ready, l know
what l have to do,

1647
00:48:21.787 --> 00:48:24.039
我想該說再見了

1648
00:48:21.787 --> 00:48:24.039
Well, l guess this is good-bye,

1649
00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:31.505
OJ!

1650
00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:31.505
- (squawking))
- OJ!


1651
00:48:31.588 --> 00:48:33.340
謝謝你，湯姆

1652
00:48:31.588 --> 00:48:33.340
(Hans)) Thanks, Tom,

1653
00:48:33.424 --> 00:48:35.342
OJ，回來﹗

1654
00:48:33.424 --> 00:48:35.342
(Tom)) OJ, come back!

1655
00:48:35.926 --> 00:48:38.012
(dog barks))

1656
00:48:38.095 --> 00:48:40.139
OJ﹗

1657
00:48:38.095 --> 00:48:40.139
OJ!

1658
00:48:42.182 --> 00:48:43.684
(squawks))

1659
00:48:50.649 --> 00:48:54.236
你好，你一定是茱莉的約會對象
進來，進來


1660
00:48:50.649 --> 00:48:54.236
Hello, You must be Julie's date,
Come in, Come in,


1661
00:48:54.278 --> 00:48:57.698
事實上，我只是來找一只鳥的

1662
00:48:54.278 --> 00:48:57.698
Actually l'm just here looking for a bird,

1663
00:48:57.781 --> 00:49:01.243
別拘束，阿爾伯特，茱莉還在准備

1664
00:48:57.781 --> 00:49:01.243
Make yourself at home, Albert,
Julie's still getting ready,


1665
00:49:01.285 --> 00:49:04.496
- 不，事實上，我的名字叫湯姆
- 抱歉，我耳朵不好使


1666
00:49:01.285 --> 00:49:04.496
- No, actually, uh, my name is Tom,
- l'm sorry, l'm hard of hearing,


1667
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.082
- 你能說大聲點嗎
- 我的名字叫湯姆﹗


1668
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.082
- Could you speak up, please?
- (shouts)) My name is Tom!


1669
00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:09.585
我肯定茱莉說過你叫阿爾伯特

1670
00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:09.585
l could've sworn Julie
said your name was Albert,


1671
00:49:09.626 --> 00:49:11.295
不，你看，恐怕是你弄錯了

1672
00:49:09.626 --> 00:49:11.295
No, see, l'm afraid that you're mistaken,

1673
00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:15.632
- 有人來了﹖
- 是的，他是茱莉的約會對象，阿爾伯特


1674
00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:15.632
- ls someone here?
- Yes, This is Julie's date, Albert,


1675
00:49:15.674 --> 00:49:17.301
- 啊﹗啊﹗
- 這是我外甥，喬治


1676
00:49:15.674 --> 00:49:17.301
- Ah! Ah!
- This is my nephew, George,


1677
00:49:17.384 --> 00:49:21.597
- 他眼睛瞎了，腿也殘廢了
- 哦，哦...很高興見到你


1678
00:49:17.384 --> 00:49:21.597
- He's blind and crippled,
- Oh, Uh,,, (shouts)) nice to meet you,


1679
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.931
我不是聾子

1680
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.931
l'm not deaf,

1681
00:49:22.973 --> 00:49:27.603
失陪一下，我去看看茱莉怎么還沒下來，
她可能太緊張了


1682
00:49:22.973 --> 00:49:27.603
Excuse me, l'll go see what's
keeping Julie, She's probably nervous,


1683
00:49:27.686 --> 00:49:29.563
你就是茱莉要約會的家伙，嗯﹖

1684
00:49:27.686 --> 00:49:29.563
So you're Julie's date, huh?

1685
00:49:29.647 --> 00:49:32.816
不，我是...我只是來，我在找一只貓頭鷹

1686
00:49:29.647 --> 00:49:32.816
No, l'm just,,, l just came here,
l was looking for an owl,


1687
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.779
你不必找什么無聊的借口

1688
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.779
(laughs)) You don't have
to make lame excuses,


1689
00:49:36.862 --> 00:49:40.574
听著，你知道作為一個殘廢的人有什么优勢嗎﹖

1690
00:49:36.862 --> 00:49:40.574
Listen, do you know what the
advantage is in being a cripple?


1691
00:49:40.658 --> 00:49:42.493
不，我不知道

1692
00:49:40.658 --> 00:49:42.493
No, l can't say that l do,

1693
00:49:42.534 --> 00:49:44.828
你不會真的在乎我說什么，對嗎﹖

1694
00:49:42.534 --> 00:49:44.828
You don't really care to hear much
what l have to say, do you?


1695
00:49:44.912 --> 00:49:47.623
不，不，不是這樣的，我...

1696
00:49:44.912 --> 00:49:47.623
No, no, lt's not that, l'm,,,

1697
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:50.668
你知道嗎﹖請說下去，我洗耳恭听

1698
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:50.668
You know what?
Go ahead, l'm listening,


1699
00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:52.961
坐下，湯姆

1700
00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:52.961
Sit down, Tom,

1701
00:49:56.924 --> 00:49:59.426
你知道我殘廢了之后得到了什么嗎﹖

1702
00:49:56.924 --> 00:49:59.426
You know what l gained
by becoming a quad?


1703
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.512
你在搖頭﹖我又看不到，你該知道﹗

1704
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.512
What, are you shaking your head?
l can't see, you know!


1705
00:50:01.595 --> 00:50:06.433
對不起，嗯...嗯...告訴我
你得到了什么


1706
00:50:01.595 --> 00:50:06.433
l'm sorry, Uh,,, uh,,,
Tell me what you gained,


1707
00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:09.436
我不再需要偉哥了

1708
00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:09.436
l no longer need my Viagra,

1709
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:13.816
現在我能夠保持興奮好几個小時

1710
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:13.816
Now l can maintain
my arousal for hours,


1711
00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:16.443
這...這棒极了，我想正所謂...

1712
00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:16.443
That's-that's great,
l guess things have a way


1713
00:50:16.527 --> 00:50:18.195
...失之東隅，收之桑榆，對嗎﹖

1714
00:50:16.527 --> 00:50:18.195
of evening themselves out
in the long run, huh?


1715
00:50:18.278 --> 00:50:20.698
不，不完全是，你知道為什么嗎﹖

1716
00:50:18.278 --> 00:50:20.698
No, not really, 
And do you know why?

1717
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:22.116
不知道，為什么﹖

1718
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:22.116
No, why?

1719
00:50:22.199 --> 00:50:24.660
因為我是個瞎了眼、廢了腿的怪物，笨蛋﹗

1720
00:50:22.199 --> 00:50:24.660
Because l am a blind,
quad freak, you moron!


1721
00:50:24.743 --> 00:50:26.704
怎么，你以為女人會喜歡我這樣的﹖﹗

1722
00:50:24.743 --> 00:50:26.704
What, you think women dig this?!

1723
00:50:26.787 --> 00:50:27.997
- 我是說，你以為女人...
- 噢，你好


1724
00:50:26.787 --> 00:50:27.997
- l mean, you think women go,,,
- Well, hello,


1725
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.040
“我要給那個變种怪胎我的電話號碼”﹖

1726
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.040
,,,''l wanna give that mutant
freak my number''?


1727
00:50:30.124 --> 00:50:33.419
- 我是肯.摩哈斯，茱莉的爸爸
- 嘿，很高興見到你


1728
00:50:30.124 --> 00:50:33.419
- Ken Morehouse, l'm Julie's dad,
- Hey, nice to meet you,


1729
00:50:33.502 --> 00:50:37.006
喬治又說他那些自怜的廢話來煩你了嗎﹖

1730
00:50:33.502 --> 00:50:37.006
ls, uh, George boring you
with his self-pitying tripe?


1731
00:50:37.047 --> 00:50:39.383
- 廢話...
- 不，一點也不


1732
00:50:37.047 --> 00:50:39.383
- Tripe,,,
- No, not at all,


1733
00:50:39.466 --> 00:50:42.678
“我是瞎子，我是瘸子，等等等等”

1734
00:50:39.466 --> 00:50:42.678
''l'm blind, l'm crippled, Boohoo-hoo,''

1735
00:50:42.761 --> 00:50:45.806
离開這個房間，我要和阿爾伯特單獨談談

1736
00:50:42.761 --> 00:50:45.806
Leave the room, l wanna talk
to Albert alone for a second,


1737
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:48.225
- 我愛呆在哪就呆在哪
- 离開這個房間﹗


1738
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:48.225
- l can stay if l want,
- Leave the room!


1739
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:49.518
- 好吧，好吧
- 出去﹗


1740
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:49.518
- OK, OK,
- Get out!


1741
00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:52.021
- 你用不著怒气沖沖
- 快出去﹗出去﹗


1742
00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:52.021
- You don't have to be huffy about it!
- Get out now! Get out!


1743
00:50:52.062 --> 00:50:55.691
- 好
- 轉彎，轉彎，轉彎


1744
00:50:52.062 --> 00:50:55.691
- OK,
- Turn it, turn it, turn it,


1745
00:50:55.733 --> 00:50:58.736
噢，老天

1746
00:50:55.733 --> 00:50:58.736
- Oh, for God's sakes,
- (clatter)


1747
00:50:58.777 --> 00:51:01.739
- 真是不好意思
- 他媽的誰把這東西擺在這﹖


1748
00:50:58.777 --> 00:51:01.739
- l'm so sorry,
- (George)) Who the hell put that there?


1749
00:51:01.822 --> 00:51:02.823
- (cat meows))
- (thud)


1750
00:51:02.906 --> 00:51:06.285
我女儿還要几分鐘才能好，你...你先坐，阿爾伯特

1751
00:51:02.906 --> 00:51:06.285
My daughter's gonna be a few minutes,
Have a-Have a seat, Albert,


1752
00:51:06.368 --> 00:51:08.037
- 湯姆
- 不，我叫肯


1753
00:51:06.368 --> 00:51:08.037
- Tom,
- No, Ken,


1754
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.413
- 沒錯，你叫肯
- 是的


1755
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.413
- Right, You're Ken,
- Yes,


1756
00:51:09.496 --> 00:51:12.916
在你說什么之前，阿爾伯特，
我只想讓你知道，茱莉...


1757
00:51:09.496 --> 00:51:12.916
Before you say anything, Albert,
l just want you to know that Julie


1758
00:51:12.958 --> 00:51:17.504
...真的很在意她的容貌，
自從那次...那次意外之后


1759
00:51:12.958 --> 00:51:17.504
is really self-conscious about her
appearance since the,,, the accident,


1760
00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:18.672
好的...

1761
00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:18.672
- (door shuts))
- Right,,,


1762
00:51:18.756 --> 00:51:23.218
- 噢，茱莉
- 茱莉，這位是阿爾伯特，
阿爾伯特，這是茱莉


1763
00:51:18.756 --> 00:51:23.218
- Oh, Julie,
- Julie, this is Albert, Albert, Julie,


1764
00:51:23.302 --> 00:51:27.097
- 見到你真好，阿爾伯特
- 哇哦，見...哇哦


1765
00:51:23.302 --> 00:51:27.097
- lt's nice to meet you, Albert,
- Wow, lt's,,, wow,


1766
00:51:27.139 --> 00:51:32.603
見到你我也很高興，
不過，事情是這樣的，我不是阿爾伯特


1767
00:51:27.139 --> 00:51:32.603
lt's nice to meet you, too,
But, the thing is, is that l'm not Albert,


1768
00:51:34.355 --> 00:51:38.400
- 也就是說我不是你在等的人
- 噢


1769
00:51:34.355 --> 00:51:38.400
- That is to say that l'm not your date,
- Oh,,


1770
00:51:38.442 --> 00:51:41.445
這是個天大的誤會

1771
00:51:38.442 --> 00:51:41.445
There's been a giant misunderstanding,

1772
00:51:41.487 --> 00:51:45.032
- 噢，你怎么能這樣﹖
- 我就知道會這樣﹗


1773
00:51:41.487 --> 00:51:45.032
- Oh, how could you?
- (crying)) l knew this would happen!


1774
00:51:45.115 --> 00:51:47.368
不，我說的是實話

1775
00:51:45.115 --> 00:51:47.368
No, l'm telling the truth,

1776
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:50.454
是茱莉不夠漂亮嗎﹖GQ先生﹖是不是﹖
（《GQ》雜志，男性時尚雜志）


1777
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:50.454
Julie wasn't pretty enough
for you, Mr, GQ? ls that it?


1778
00:51:50.537 --> 00:51:55.042
- 不，你不明白
- 噢，我明白，“法比奧”
（法比奧，可能是指一個著名封面男模）


1779
00:51:50.537 --> 00:51:55.042
- No, you don't understand,
- Oh, l understand, Fabio,


1780
00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:57.961
- 你傷害了這個可怜的女孩
- 不不，我不是...


1781
00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:57.961
- You broke that poor girl's heart,
- No, no, See, l'm not,,,


1782
00:51:58.045 --> 00:52:01.465
你以為茱莉是白痴嗎﹖
你以為是她接受你恩賜的童話故事嗎﹖


1783
00:51:58.045 --> 00:52:01.465
Do you think Julie is an idiot? Do you
think she bought your little fairy tale


1784
00:52:01.507 --> 00:52:04.093
先生，穿著醫用鞋套很迷人嗎﹖

1785
00:52:01.507 --> 00:52:04.093
Mr, l'm Too Sexy
for my medical booties?


1786
00:52:04.968 --> 00:52:07.554
- 噢，這...
- 滾出去


1787
00:52:04.968 --> 00:52:07.554
- Oh, th,,,
- Get the hell out of here,


1788
00:52:07.638 --> 00:52:10.226
再不滾我就把你的英俊屁股踹到天上去

1789
00:52:07.638 --> 00:52:12.226
Or l'll kick your pretty-boy ass
to kingdom come,


1790
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:16.230
- 有什么事被我打斷了嗎﹖
- 沒有，只不過...


1791
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:16.230
- Am l interrupting something?
- No, it's just that the,,,


1792
00:52:16.313 --> 00:52:20.651
- (squawks))
- (grunts))


1793
00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:23.445
湯姆，有兩件事我們得談談

1794
00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:23.445
Tom, there's two things
that we need to talk about,


1795
00:52:23.487 --> 00:52:24.488
什么事﹖

1796
00:52:23.487 --> 00:52:24.488
What?

1797
00:52:24.571 --> 00:52:26.865
首先，我再也不要穿著這些鞋套了

1798
00:52:24.571 --> 00:52:26.865
First of all, l don't wanna
wear these booties anymore,


1799
00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:29.868
- 沒人穿著這樣的鞋套
- 行


1800
00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:29.868
- No one else is wearing the booties,
- Fine,


1801
00:52:29.952 --> 00:52:33.747
- 還有呢﹖
- 蒂娜認為她得了癌症


1802
00:52:29.952 --> 00:52:33.747
- What's the other thing?
- Tina thinks she's got cancer,


1803
00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:37.793
- 你摸到沒有﹖
- 嗯，我剛...


1804
00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:37.793
- Do you feel it?
- Uh, l'm just,,,


1805
00:52:37.835 --> 00:52:42.214
- 這儿會有什么東西嗎﹖我沒有...
- 看到沒有，蒂娜﹖


1806
00:52:37.835 --> 00:52:42.214
- What's supposed to be there? l don't,,,
- See, Tina?


1807
00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:45.467
左邊一點，這附近

1808
00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:45.467
Move your hand to the left,
Now move it around,


1809
00:52:45.509 --> 00:52:47.720
噢

1810
00:52:45.509 --> 00:52:47.720
Uh-huh,

1811
00:52:47.803 --> 00:52:51.473
- 你沒有感覺到有東西嗎﹖
- 是的，我是說，沒有，沒有


1812
00:52:47.803 --> 00:52:51.473
- Don't you feel anything?
- Yeah, l mean, no, no,


1813
00:52:51.557 --> 00:52:53.350
沒有，它好像...嗯...

1814
00:52:51.557 --> 00:52:53.350
No, it seems to be,,, Well,,,

1815
00:52:53.392 --> 00:52:55.978
蒂娜，你的乳房和我的毫無區別，行了嗎﹖

1816
00:52:53.392 --> 00:52:55.978
Tina, your breast is no
different than mine, OK?


1817
00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.150
- 就是有，你又沒比過
- 湯姆，摸摸我的乳房，比一比


1818
00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.150
- lt is, There's no comparison,
- Tom, feel my breast and compare,


1819
00:53:01.191 --> 00:53:04.028
現在你發現我們兩個的乳房有什么不同嗎﹖

1820
00:53:01.191 --> 00:53:04.028
Now, do you detect any difference
between our breasts?


1821
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:07.156
- 嗯...你們別太急
- 好舒服


1822
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:07.156
- Well,,, You gotta slow down a little,
- lt sure feels good,


1823
00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:09.783
嗯，你的乳房...

1824
00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:09.783
- Well, yours is a,,,
- (door opens))


1825
00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:13.162
- 麗莎，這不是你看到的那么回事
- 我信了你說的每句話


1826
00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:13.162
- Lisa, this isn't what it looks like,
- l believed everything you said,


1827
00:53:13.704 --> 00:53:14.663
我是在...

1828
00:53:13.704 --> 00:53:14.663
l'm,,,

1829
00:53:14.747 --> 00:53:16.248
全都只是甜言蜜語，是嗎﹖

1830
00:53:14.747 --> 00:53:16.248
lt was all just a
bunch of lines, wasn't it?

1831
00:53:16.332 --> 00:53:20.419
不，不，麗莎，都是...
我向你發誓，每字每句都是真心的


1832
00:53:16.332 --> 00:53:20.419
No, no, Lisa, it was all,,,
l swear to you, l meant every word,


1833
00:53:20.502 --> 00:53:21.962
這...這里什么事都發生

1834
00:53:20.502 --> 00:53:21.962
This is,,, nothing's going on here,

1835
00:53:22.046 --> 00:53:24.882
很好，湯姆，真高興你認為
我是個完完全全的白痴


1836
00:53:22.046 --> 00:53:24.882
Great, Tom, l'm glad you think
l'm a complete idiot,


1837
00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:29.845
不，不，我告訴你，
我是在給她們檢查乳腺癌


1838
00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:29.845
No, no, l'm telling you, l was just
checking these girls for breast cancer,


1839
00:53:30.471 --> 00:53:35.142
- 你讓我惡心
- 不，麗莎，等等﹗


1840
00:53:30.471 --> 00:53:35.142
- You make me sick,
- No,,, Lisa, wait!


1841
00:53:35.768 --> 00:53:38.520
- 她絕對不會原諒我了
- 她當然會原諒你


1842
00:53:35.768 --> 00:53:38.520
- She's never gonna forgive me,
- Of course she will,


1843
00:53:38.562 --> 00:53:39.730
這是你第一次對她不忠﹖

1844
00:53:38.562 --> 00:53:39.730
ls this the first
time you cheated on her?

1845
00:53:39.813 --> 00:53:43.150
是的，不﹗我...慢著﹗

1846
00:53:39.813 --> 00:53:43.150
Yeah, No! l,,, yeah,,, wait,

1847
00:53:43.233 --> 00:53:46.695
我沒有對她不忠，老天，你在場的呀﹗

1848
00:53:43.233 --> 00:53:46.695
l didn't cheat on her, l mean,
you were there for God's sakes!


1849
00:53:46.779 --> 00:53:48.322
听著，我知道你沒有對她不忠

1850
00:53:46.779 --> 00:53:48.322
Look, l know that
you didn't cheat on her,


1851
00:53:48.405 --> 00:53:50.574
- 我是說，你剛才是有點貪婪，不過...
- 我...


1852
00:53:48.405 --> 00:53:50.574
- l mean, you were a little grabby, but,,,
- l,,,


1853
00:53:50.658 --> 00:53:52.201
听著，你不覺得我們應該先找到貓頭鷹...

1854
00:53:50.658 --> 00:53:52.201
Look, don't you think
we should just find the owl


1855
00:53:52.284 --> 00:53:54.161
...再來擔心你的風流韻事嗎﹖

1856
00:53:52.284 --> 00:53:54.161
and worry about your little ''affair'' later?

1857
00:53:54.244 --> 00:53:57.247
我...我要...我要發狂了，可我不想發狂

1858
00:53:54.244 --> 00:53:57.247
l,,, l am get,,, l'm getting angry
and l don't get angry,


1859
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:58.832
- 噢﹗
- 嘿，史彼得﹖


1860
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:58.832
- Ugh!
- Hey, Speed?


1861
00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.043
嘿，我能問你個問題嗎﹖

1862
00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.043
Hey, can l ask you a question?

1863
00:54:02.252 --> 00:54:06.674
- 你在干...我以為你走了
- 我是走了...去拿這個


1864
00:54:02.252 --> 00:54:06.674
- What are you,,, l thought you left,
- l did,,, to get this,


1865
00:54:07.424 --> 00:54:11.136
- 好吧，爐火怎么著了﹖
- 很暖和，是吧﹖


1866
00:54:07.424 --> 00:54:11.136
- All right, Why is the fire going?
- Cozy, isn't it?


1867
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.182
- 好吧，你放下那玩意
- 逼我呀


1868
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.182
- All right, You put that down,

1869
00:54:16.433 --> 00:54:18.394
行﹗

00:54:16.433 --> 00:54:18.394
All right,

1871
00:54:20.396 --> 00:54:24.566
嘿﹗嘿﹗放下撬棍﹗

1872
00:54:20.396 --> 00:54:24.566
Hey! Hey! Put the crowbar down!

1873
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.112
不然我轟爆你的屁股﹗

1874
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.112
Or l will blow your ass to fucktown!

1875
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.710

00:54:53.012 --> 00:54:55.764
唯一的不同是，你沒膽子用你的槍

1882
00:54:53.012 --> 00:54:55.764
Only difference is, you don't
have the guts to use yours,

奧德莉﹗

2024
00:59:23.574 --> 00:59:26.910
Audrey!

2025
00:59:26.952 --> 00:59:31.290
天吶﹗他像個人体振動按摩器

2026
00:59:26.952 --> 00:59:31.290
(gasps)) Oh, my God!
He's like a human vibrator,


2027
00:59:31.373 --> 00:59:33.625
什么...他是怎么回事﹖

2028
00:59:31.373 --> 00:59:33.625
What,,, All right,
what is wrong with him?


2029
00:59:33.709 --> 00:59:36.211
- 我不知道，你偷偷給他吃了藥﹖
- 是的


2030
00:59:33.709 --> 00:59:36.211
- l don't know, Did you slip him the pill?
- Yes,


2031
00:59:36.253 --> 00:59:37.254
那一定是藥起作用了

2032
00:59:36.253 --> 00:59:37.254
Then that must be it then,

2033
00:59:37.338 --> 00:59:39.173
你不是把藥溶在威士忌里給他喝的吧﹖

2034
00:59:37.338 --> 00:59:39.173
You didn't give him the pill
with whiskey, did you?


2035
00:59:39.256 --> 00:59:41.258
- 是啊
- 噢，不﹗


2036
00:59:39.256 --> 00:59:41.258
- Yeah,
- Oh, no!


2037
00:59:41.342 --> 00:59:44.928
- 你不該把這兩樣溶在一起
- 奧德莉，你沒跟我說過﹗


2038
00:59:41.342 --> 00:59:44.928
- You're not supposed to mix the two,
- Audrey, you did not tell me that!


2039
00:59:45.012 --> 00:59:47.556
任何人都知道不該把藥和酒溶在一起﹗

2040
00:59:45.012 --> 00:59:47.556
Everyone knows that you're not
supposed to mix booze with pills!


2041
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.517
- 拜托﹗
- 好了，他會沒事嗎﹖


2042
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.517
- Come on!
- OK, ls he gonna be OK?


2043
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:53.562
別擔心，他會好的，我曾經是醫護人員

2044
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:53.562
Don't worry, He'll be fine,
l used to be a paramedic,


2045
00:59:53.646 --> 00:59:57.441
- 湯姆﹖我想我發現OJ了
- OJ﹖我才沒空管...


2046
00:59:53.646 --> 00:59:57.441
- Tom? l think l found OJ,
- OJ? l don't care about,,,


2047
00:59:57.483 --> 01:00:00.235
我們這里出事了，奧德莉，打911﹗

2048
00:59:57.483 --> 01:00:00.235
We have a situation here,
Audrey, call 91 1 !


2049
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:03.113
- 我跟你說了，他會好的
- 你肯定﹖


2050
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:03.113
- l'm telling ya, he'll be fine,
- Are you sure?


2051
01:00:03.197 --> 01:00:06.533
- 他只要休息一會，我肯定
- 好吧，你看著TJ，用這個


2052
01:00:03.197 --> 01:00:06.533
- He just needs some rest, l'm positive,
- OK, You watch TJ, Use this,


2053
01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:09.286
沒有裝子彈，不過他不知道

2054
01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:09.286
lt's not loaded, but he doesn't know that,

2055
01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.913
噢，拜托﹗

2056
01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.913
- (doorbell)
- Oh, man!


2057
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:15.584
- 噢，嘿
- 我是茱莉


2058
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:15.584
- Oh, hey,
- Julie,


2059
01:00:15.668 --> 01:00:17.961
- 來自...
- 隔壁街區的，沒錯


2060
01:00:15.668 --> 01:00:17.961
- From,,, yeah,
- Down the block, That's right,


2061
01:00:18.045 --> 01:00:19.088
我可以進來嗎﹖

2062
01:00:18.045 --> 01:00:19.088
You mind if l come in?

2063
01:00:19.129 --> 01:00:20.339
就這樣，你抓住他的腳踝

2064
01:00:19.129 --> 01:00:20.339
(Audrey)) All right, 
You grab his ankles,,,

2065
01:00:20.422 --> 01:00:22.424
我們不如去那邊那個房間

2066
01:00:20.422 --> 01:00:22.424
Why don't we go
to that room over there?


2067
01:00:22.508 --> 01:00:26.095
- 好，我抓住這頭
- 噢，他好重


2068
01:00:22.508 --> 01:00:26.095
- (Speed) OK, yeah, l got this end,
- (Audrey)) Man, he's heavy,


2069
01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:30.474
我可以坐下嗎﹖

2070
01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:30.474
Do you mind if l sit down?

2071
01:00:30.557 --> 01:00:34.728
- 哦，當然可以
- 謝謝


2072
01:00:30.557 --> 01:00:34.728
- Uh,,, yeah, Sure,
- Thank you,


2073
01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:41.902
噢，嘿，抱歉打攪你們了，
嗨，我是萊德


2074
01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:41.902
Oh, hey, Sorry to
butt in, Hi, l'm Red,

2075
01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:44.321
- 嗨，幸會
- 幸會


2076
01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:44.321
- Hi, it's nice to meet you,
- Nice to meet ya,


2077
01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:47.950
是這樣，我那個真的約會對象來了后，
我才知道你說的是實話


2078
01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:47.950
Anyway, l realized you were telling
the truth when my real date showed up,


2079
01:00:47.992 --> 01:00:52.496
- 當然他沒有留下來
- 只能說他是個笨蛋


2080
01:00:47.992 --> 01:00:52.496
- Of course he didn't stick around,
- Well, that guy is a bum,


2081
01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:54.623
我肯定不是因為你

2082
01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:54.623
Well, l'm sure that had
nothing to do with you,


2083
01:00:54.707 --> 01:00:56.125
不，我知道是我的原因

2084
01:00:54.707 --> 01:00:56.125
No, l know it did,

2085
01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:59.962
即使在出事之前，我也沒吸引過任何男孩

2086
01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:59.962
l've never had any guys attracted to me,
even before the accident,


2087
01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.131
絕對不可能

2088
01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.131
Now that cannot be true,

2089
01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:05.634
大約半年前，我在路上搭了便車

2090
01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:05.634
Well,,, about six months ago,
l was hitchhiking


2091
01:01:05.676 --> 01:01:08.762
結果卡車司机想強奸我，除此之外...

2092
01:01:05.676 --> 01:01:08.762
and a trucker tried to rape me,
but other than that,,,


2093
01:01:08.846 --> 01:01:12.266
拜托，你是告訴我你從未交過男友﹖

2094
01:01:08.846 --> 01:01:12.266
Come on, You're gonna tell me,
you never had a real boyfriend?


2095
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:16.228
嗯，只有一次，不過我認為他只是可怜我

2096
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:16.228
Well, once, but l think
he just felt sorry for me,


2097
01:01:16.312 --> 01:01:19.523
你和他交往了多久﹖

2098
01:01:16.312 --> 01:01:19.523
Oh, well, uh,,, how long did that last?

2099
01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:23.986
大約6年，然后有一天，他就那么走了

2100
01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:23.986
Um,,, about six years
and then one day, he just left,


2101
01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:27.906
- 有別的女人﹖
- 不，他被巴士車撞了


2102
01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:27.906
- Another woman?
- No, He got hit by a bus,


2103
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.575
你看，并不是你的原因

2104
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.575
(Red) Well, see that's not your fault,

2105
01:01:29.658 --> 01:01:32.077
但他好像沒有很努力去避開那輛巴士

2106
01:01:29.658 --> 01:01:32.077
Well, he didn't seem to try
very hard to avoid the bus,


2107
01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:34.705
我想他就是想逃离我們這段關系

2108
01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:34.705
l think he just wanted
out of the relationship,


2109
01:01:34.788 --> 01:01:37.374
茱莉，你為何不坐這張椅子﹖

2110
01:01:34.788 --> 01:01:37.374
Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

2111
01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:39.835
噢，我開始覺得有點頭暈了

2112
01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:39.835
Oh, geez, l'm starting
to feel a bit woozy,


2113
01:01:39.877 --> 01:01:42.004
(blood squishes))

2114
01:01:42.087 --> 01:01:45.299
好了，我得去找OJ了

2115
01:01:42.087 --> 01:01:45.299
OK, All right, l
have to go find OJ,

2116
01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:49.887
萊德，如果你能幫我看著點，就太好了

2117
01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:49.887
So, Red, if you could watch things
for me, that'd be great,


2118
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:53.140
沒問題

2119
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:53.140
Got ya,

2120
01:01:56.352 --> 01:01:59.813
听著，我認為你對自己太苛刻了

2121
01:01:56.352 --> 01:01:59.813
Look, l think you're being
way too hard on yourself,


2122
01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:04.151
而且，我打賭有很多男孩曾被你吸引

2123
01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:04.151
l mean, besides, l bet there've been a lot
of guys who've been attracted to you,


2124
01:02:04.234 --> 01:02:06.862
不，他是唯一一個

2125
01:02:04.234 --> 01:02:06.862
No, he was the only one,

2126
01:02:06.945 --> 01:02:10.574
還有那個卡車司机呢﹖顯然你迷住他了

2127
01:02:06.945 --> 01:02:10.574
What about that trucker? l mean,
he was obviously attracted to you,


2128
01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:13.577
我想當時無論是誰那個司机都會強奸

2129
01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:13.577
(sighs)) l think the trucker probably
would have raped anyone,


2130
01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:17.373
我很怀疑，也許他認為你特別漂亮

2131
01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:17.373
l doubt that, You were probably
pretty special to him,


2132
01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:19.667
你真好，萊德

2133
01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:19.667
(chuckles)) So sweet of you, Red,

2134
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.878
我也不是要煩你，我是說真的

2135
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.878
l'm not just jerking
your chain either, l mean it,


2136
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.839


2137
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.839
- (giggles))
- Yeah, (chuckles))


2138
01:02:29.468 --> 01:02:34.598
- 你們動這草坪干什么﹖
- 沒什么，湯姆，我們只是想埋了TJ


2139
01:02:29.468 --> 01:02:34.598
- What are you doing to the lawn?
- lt's OK, Tom, We just had to bury TJ,


2140
01:02:34.682 --> 01:02:38.394
埋...什么﹖你是說，他...

2141
01:02:34.682 --> 01:02:38.394
Bury,,, what? You mean, he's,,,

2142
01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:42.564
你說過他會沒事的，我以為你曾經是醫護人員

2143
01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:42.564
You said he was gonna be OK!
l thought you were a paramedic,


2144
01:02:42.606 --> 01:02:46.068
- 我是上過醫護方面的課
- 你上過...你...你們...


2145
01:02:42.606 --> 01:02:46.068
- Well, l took a course,
- You took,,, you-you guy,,,


2146
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.028
你們不能就這么埋了他﹗

2147
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.028
You can't just bury him, you guys!

2148
01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.947
我們可不會把他放到我車里

2149
01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.947
Well, we're not gonna
put him in my car,

2150
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:53.492
- 沒錯
- 好了，別說了，我打911


2151
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:53.492
- (Audrey)) That's right,
- All right, Forget it, l'm calling 91 1 ,


2152
01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:56.370
- 那是需要急救才打的
- 你認為這是什么情況﹖


2153
01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:56.370
- That's for emergencies,
- What do you think this is?


2154
01:02:56.453 --> 01:02:59.581
這家伙已經死了，過20分鐘，他仍然是死人一個

2155
01:02:56.453 --> 01:02:59.581
The guy's dead, ln 20 minutes,
he's still gonna be dead,


2156
01:02:59.623 --> 01:03:02.084
叫急救車來沒有意義

2157
01:02:59.623 --> 01:03:02.084
- There's no sense of urgency here,
- (chuckles))


2158
01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:05.254
不，我們必須報警，跟警察報告這件事

2159
01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:05.254
No, we have to call the cops
and report it!


2160
01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:10.551
- 跟他們怎么說﹖
- 說事實﹗發生了一次意外


2161
01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:10.551
- And tell 'em what?
- The truth! That there was a,,, accident,


2162
01:03:10.634 --> 01:03:14.972
- 他們可能不那么看
- 面對現實吧，湯姆，是你殺了他


2163
01:03:10.634 --> 01:03:14.972
- They might not see it that way,
- Let's face it, Tom, You did kill him,


2164
01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:18.475
- 是你給我那种藥
- 嘿，我沒有叫你殺死任何人，拜托﹖


2165
01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:18.475
- You gave me the pill,
- Hey, l didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?


2166
01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:20.269
但你沒告訴我不能用威士忌﹗

2167
01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:20.269
Well, you didn't tell me
not to use the whiskey!


2168
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:23.397
- 如果你听我說了...
- 你根本就沒有提威士忌﹗


2169
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:23.397
- Well, if you'd listen to me,,,
- You didn't say anything about whiskey!


2170
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.274
我以為你會听我的

2171
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.274
- (whistles))
- l would think you would listen to me!


2172
01:03:25.316 --> 01:03:26.859
沒時間互相推諉了

2173
01:03:25.316 --> 01:03:26.859
There's no time for blame games,

2174
01:03:26.942 --> 01:03:29.653
你何不鋪些樹葉﹖讓它看上去更自然

2175
01:03:26.942 --> 01:03:29.653
Why don't you spread around
some leaves? Make it look good,


2176
01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:32.781
我不會幫你藏匿一具尸体﹗

2177
01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:32.781
l am not gonna help
you conceal a dead body!


2178
01:03:32.823 --> 01:03:35.993
嘿，你們不覺的我們該說點什么嗎﹖

2179
01:03:32.823 --> 01:03:35.993
Hey, you know what? Don't you
think we should say something?


2180
01:03:36.076 --> 01:03:37.328
- 什么﹖
- 她說得對


2181
01:03:36.076 --> 01:03:37.328
- What?
- You know what? She's right,


2182
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:40.122
最后的儀式或者頌詞，或者類似的玩意﹖

2183
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:40.122
Some kind of last rites or eulogy
or something like that?


2184
01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:42.499
- 我要暈了
- 我們是該說几句


2185
01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:42.499
- l'm so screwed,
- We should say something,


2186
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:49.131
好了，好了，說吧，赶快

2187
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:49.131
Fine, fine, You know what? Say
something, Get,,, just make it quick,


2188
01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:55.262
主，今天我們下葬TJ，他是...

2189
01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:55.262
Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ,
who was, uh,,,


2190
01:03:55.846 --> 01:03:57.848
- 我真的不了解他
- 我也不了解他


2191
01:03:55.846 --> 01:03:57.848
- l really didn't know him,
- l don't know him,


2192
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.683
湯姆，你是最了解他的，不如你來說吧﹖

2193
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.683
l mean, Tom, you know him the best,
Why don't you say something?


2194
01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:01.268
- 我﹖
- 是的


2195
01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:01.268
- Me?
- Yeah,


2196
01:04:01.352 --> 01:04:05.814
我只知道這家伙是個狂暴的殘忍的暴徒，
而且對女同性戀很感興趣


2197
01:04:01.352 --> 01:04:05.814
All l know is that the guy was a violent,
sadistic goon that was into lesbians,


2198
01:04:05.898 --> 01:04:08.233
阿門

2199
01:04:05.898 --> 01:04:08.233
Amen,

2200
01:04:08.317 --> 01:04:11.695
- 湯姆﹖
- 麗莎


2201
01:04:08.317 --> 01:04:11.695
- Tom?
- Lisa,


2202
01:04:11.779 --> 01:04:14.531
- 我不敢相信你還在這里
- 听著，求你了


2203
01:04:11.779 --> 01:04:14.531
- l can't believe you're still here,
- Listen, please,


2204
01:04:14.615 --> 01:04:15.824
你必須听我解釋

2205
01:04:14.615 --> 01:04:15.824
You have to let me explain,

2206
01:04:15.866 --> 01:04:19.662
听著，湯姆，今晚只是個錯誤，僅此而已

2207
01:04:15.866 --> 01:04:19.662
Look, Tom, Tonight was just a
big mistake, That's all there is to it,


2208
01:04:19.703 --> 01:04:26.543
不，你...你看到的我和那兩個女孩的事情，
都只是怪异的巧合罷了


2209
01:04:19.703 --> 01:04:26.543
No, you,,, that,,, what you saw with
the girls, all that was was weird timing,


2210
01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:29.338
萊德﹖萊德來這里干什么﹖

2211
01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:29.338
Red? What's Red doing here?

2212
01:04:29.421 --> 01:04:33.384
萊德﹖噢，萊德剛好在附近

2213
01:04:29.421 --> 01:04:33.384
Red? Oh, uh, Red
was in the neighborhood


2214
01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:34.968
他順便路過這里

2215
01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:34.968
and he-and he stopped by,

2216
01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:38.180
不過，你看，今晚并沒發生什么
真的很糟糕的事情


2217
01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:38.180
But, you see, nothing really
bad happened tonight,


2218
01:04:38.263 --> 01:04:44.019
- OJ不見了是因為他嗎﹖
- 不，不是，嗯...OJ沒有拴好


2219
01:04:38.263 --> 01:04:44.019
- ls he the reason OJ's gone?
- No, No, uh,,, OJ got loose,


2220
01:04:44.061 --> 01:04:46.605
這是個小問題，不過我們會找到他的

2221
01:04:44.061 --> 01:04:46.605
And that's a little problem,
But we're gonna find him,


2222
01:04:46.689 --> 01:04:49.149
而且我們正在找他，所以...

2223
01:04:46.689 --> 01:04:49.149
And we're looking for him, so,,,

2224
01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:50.609
這是什么﹖

2225
01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:50.609
What's this?

2226
01:04:50.693 --> 01:04:54.697
哦，湯姆殺了一個人，我們在掩埋他的尸体

2227
01:04:50.693 --> 01:04:54.697
Oh, uh, Tom killed a guy
and we're burying the body,


2228
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.032
- 好吧，這件事挺糟糕的
- 啊﹗


2229
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.032
- OK, that was bad,
- Aah!


2230
01:04:57.116 --> 01:05:00.244
現在是你反應過度了，并不是...

2231
01:04:57.116 --> 01:05:00.244
OK, well, now you're
overreacting, lt's not,,,


2232
01:05:00.327 --> 01:05:01.912
- 噢﹗
- 啊﹗


2233
01:05:00.327 --> 01:05:01.912
- Oh!
- Aah!


2234
01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:09.920
(all yelling))

2235
01:05:10.004 --> 01:05:11.755
好了，好了，嘿

2236
01:05:10.004 --> 01:05:11.755
All right, all right, hey,

2237
01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:17.386
誰敢動一動，她的腦袋上就會有個大洞

2238
01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:17.386
Anybody moves, there's gonna be
a big hole where her brain used to be,


2239
01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:22.808
是嗎，動手呀，開槍呀

2240
01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:22.808
Yeah, Go ahead, shoot,

2241
01:05:23.767 --> 01:05:25.853
你還等什么﹖動手呀﹗

2242
01:05:23.767 --> 01:05:25.853
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on!


2243
01:05:25.936 --> 01:05:27.187
你還等什么﹖﹗干掉這婊子﹗

2244
01:05:25.936 --> 01:05:27.187
What are you waiting for?!
Waste the bitch!


2245
01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:29.231
- 湯姆﹗
- 不，我才不在乎﹗


2246
01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:29.231
- Tom!
- No, l don't give a shit!


2247
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:32.985
- 嘿，我可不是說笑，混蛋
- 是嗎﹖


2248
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:32.985
- Hey, l'm not joking, asshole,
- Yeah?


2249
01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:36.780
扣扳机呀，來呀，來呀﹗

2250
01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:36.780
Pull the trigger, Come on, Come on!

2251
01:05:38.657 --> 01:05:42.411
我看你是光說不練

2252
01:05:38.657 --> 01:05:42.411
l think you're just all talk,

2253
01:05:45.998 --> 01:05:48.959
看來我們兩個都有槍啊

2254
01:05:45.998 --> 01:05:48.959
Looks like we both got guns,

2255
01:05:50.502 --> 01:05:53.422
這次誰會先開槍﹖

2256
01:05:50.502 --> 01:05:53.422
Who's gonna shoot first this time?

2257
01:05:56.633 --> 01:05:59.219
(chuckles))

2258
01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:01.472
(groans))

2259
01:06:01.555 --> 01:06:03.766
這樣應該可以了吧

2260
01:06:01.555 --> 01:06:03.766
(Red) Well, that should do it,

2261
01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:06.810
湯姆﹗你太勇敢了

2262
01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:06.810
Tom! You are so brave,

2263
01:06:06.852 --> 01:06:10.105
不，不，根本沒什么大不了的，
這支槍根本沒裝子彈...


2264
01:06:06.852 --> 01:06:10.105
No, no, lt's not even that big of a deal,
This gun's not even loaded,,,


2265
01:06:10.147 --> 01:06:11.315
- (gunshot)
- (grunt)


2266
01:06:11.398 --> 01:06:13.317
見鬼這是怎么回事﹖

2267
01:06:11.398 --> 01:06:13.317
(man)) What the hell is going on?

2268
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.820
我真不應該怀疑你，
你為了我，拿你自己的命來冒險


2269
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.820
l never should have doubted you,
You risked your life for me,


2270
01:06:16.904 --> 01:06:19.740
奧德莉在廚房里找到一些子彈，
可能被我重新上到槍里了


2271
01:06:16.904 --> 01:06:19.740
Audrey found some bullets in
the kitchen and l may have reloaded it,


2272
01:06:19.823 --> 01:06:21.825
沒錯，是我上的

2273
01:06:19.823 --> 01:06:21.825
Yeah, l did,

2274
01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:26.121
各位，打扰一下，誰認識一個叫杰克.泰勒的人嗎﹖

2275
01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:26.121
Yo, excuse me, Does anyone here
know a Jack Taylor?


2276
01:06:26.163 --> 01:06:27.498
什么事﹖

2277
01:06:26.163 --> 01:06:27.498
Why?

2278
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.377
這小子剛打電話來，說如果
我不在15分鐘內赶到火車站接他...


2279
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.377
This dude just called, said if l don't pick
him up at the train station in 1 5 minutes,


2280
01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.463
...我就要失去工作了，你覺得這是怎么回事﹖

2281
01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.463
l'm out of a job, What do
you suppose that means?


2282
01:06:34.505 --> 01:06:35.631
噢，天吶

2283
01:06:34.505 --> 01:06:35.631
Oh, my God,

2284
01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:37.675
我也是這么想的，因為我根本就沒有工作

2285
01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:37.675
That's what l thought,
'cause l ain't got no job,


2286
01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:39.635
- 他提早回家了
- 好了，別擔心


2287
01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:39.635
- He's coming home early,
- OK, don't worry about it,


2288
01:06:39.677 --> 01:06:42.805
一切有我，好嗎﹖相信我，你只要別開車太快了

2289
01:06:39.677 --> 01:06:42.805
l'll take care of everything, OK?
Trust me, Just don't drive too fast,


2290
01:06:42.846 --> 01:06:44.181
知道了

2291
01:06:42.846 --> 01:06:44.181
Got it,

2292
01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:46.809
還有，或許你該把這東西收好

2293
01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:46.809
And, um, maybe you
should put that away,


2294
01:06:46.892 --> 01:06:50.354
噢，天吶

2295
01:06:46.892 --> 01:06:50.354
Oh, God,

我就知道是你

2303
01:07:40.904 --> 01:07:44.325
l knew that was you,

2304
01:08:20.861 --> 01:08:22.237
(beer bottles clank)

2305
01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:13.664
既然禮拜一下午我們要去泰國開會

2306
01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:13.664
(Taylor) As long as we're in Thailand
for the meeting on Monday afternoon,


2307
01:09:13.747 --> 01:09:17.918
好的，可以趁我們在夏威夷加油時帶上它

2308
01:09:13.747 --> 01:09:17.918
Yeah, We can pick it up
when we refuel in Hawaii,


2309
01:09:18.544 --> 01:09:21.380
嘿，要不要先停車，喝點東西...

2310
01:09:18.544 --> 01:09:21.380
Hey, uh, do you wanna stop
and, uh, get something to drink,


2311
01:09:21.463 --> 01:09:22.756
...或者上一下洗手間什么的﹖

2312
01:09:21.463 --> 01:09:22.756
go to the bathroom or something?

2313
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.925
我們現在就把各部門頭頭帶過去

2314
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.925
We'll take the departmental heads now

2315
01:09:25.009 --> 01:09:28.345
几個禮拜后再讓創意小組過去

2316
01:09:25.009 --> 01:09:28.345
and the Creative team
in a couple of weeks,


2317
01:09:28.387 --> 01:09:29.763
(squeaks))

2318
01:09:37.855 --> 01:09:39.898
那是午餐前的行程安排，然后是午餐...

2319
01:09:37.855 --> 01:09:39.898
That's the agenda up to lunch,
then there's lunch,,,


2320
01:09:39.982 --> 01:09:43.152
(squawking))

2321
01:09:48.866 --> 01:09:52.619
好的，那么...

2322
01:09:48.866 --> 01:09:52.619
- OK, And then,,,
- (squawks))


2323
01:09:52.703 --> 01:09:56.332
- (horns honk)
- (tires screech))


2324
01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:59.710
行，行

2325
01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:59.710
OK, OK,

2326
01:10:01.211 --> 01:10:03.505
行，好的

2327
01:10:01.211 --> 01:10:03.505
OK, fine,

2328
01:10:07.384 --> 01:10:12.222
- 斯坦菲爾德，你在干什么﹖
- 沒什么，先生


2329
01:10:07.384 --> 01:10:12.222
- Stansfield, what are you doing?
- Nothing, sir,


2330
01:10:12.306 --> 01:10:15.059
請稍等

2331
01:10:12.306 --> 01:10:15.059
Hold on a moment, please,

2332
01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:20.022
斯坦菲爾德，你為何不專心開你的車...

2333
01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:20.022
Stansfield,,, why don't you
just concentrate on the driving


2334
01:10:20.064 --> 01:10:23.025
讓我繼續打我的電話﹖

2335
01:10:20.064 --> 01:10:23.025
and let me get
on with making my call,

2336
01:10:23.067 --> 01:10:25.736
- 等等﹗
- 又怎么了，斯坦菲爾德﹖


2337
01:10:23.067 --> 01:10:25.736
- Wait!
- What is it now, Stansfield?


2338
01:10:25.819 --> 01:10:30.240
噢，沒什么，先生，快到家了

2339
01:10:25.819 --> 01:10:30.240
Oh, nothing, sir, Almost home,

2340
01:10:48.425 --> 01:10:52.763
- 嘿，這東西怎么跑進去了﹖
- 小心那玩意


2341
01:10:48.425 --> 01:10:52.763
- Hey, How'd this get in there?
- Oh, be careful with that,


2342
01:10:52.805 --> 01:10:54.682
我會小心的，是我發現的好東西

2343
01:10:52.805 --> 01:10:54.682
l will, Good thing l found it,

2344
01:10:54.765 --> 01:10:57.726
處理一把手槍可以有几种方法

2345
01:10:54.765 --> 01:10:57.726
There's several ways to properly
dispose of a handgun,


2346
01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.270
但不包括把槍扔到垃圾袋里

2347
01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.270
none of which include
putting it in a garbage bag,


2348
01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:03.399
不許動﹗警察﹗不許動﹗

2349
01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:03.399
(cop over megaphone))
Freeze! Police! Freeze!


2350
01:11:03.482 --> 01:11:05.442
放開那女孩﹗舉起雙手﹗

2351
01:11:03.482 --> 01:11:05.442
Let go of the girl
and put your hands in the air!


2352
01:11:05.484 --> 01:11:07.277
你被徹底包圍了，TJ﹗

2353
01:11:05.484 --> 01:11:07.277
You're completely surrounded, TJ!

2354
01:11:07.361 --> 01:11:09.905
放下武器，把手放在頭上﹗

2355
01:11:07.361 --> 01:11:09.905
Put down your weapons
and put your hands on you head!


2356
01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:15.369
不，你們弄錯了，他不是TJ，
我是麗莎.泰勒，這是我老爸的房子


2357
01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:15.369
No, you guys, Wait, He's not TJ,
l'm Lisa Taylor, This is my dad's house,


2358
01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:17.287
小姐，我們接到多宗報案

2359
01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:17.287
Ma'am, we've received
numerous reports


2360
01:11:17.329 --> 01:11:18.789
說這一帶發生了行竊、槍擊...

2361
01:11:17.329 --> 01:11:18.789
from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire,,,

2362
01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:23.085
行了，听著，我知道你們可能
以為我們殺了某個人


2363
01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:23.085
All right, Look, l know you probably
think we may have killed somebody,


2364
01:11:23.127 --> 01:11:24.878
但是湯姆并不知道他會毒倒那個家伙

2365
01:11:23.127 --> 01:11:24.878
but Tom didn't know
he poisoned the guy,


2366
01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:28.924
我們埋葬他的時候以為他死了，
不過他現在看上去好的很


2367
01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:28.924
and we thought he was dead when
we buried him, But he seems OK now,


2368
01:11:28.966 --> 01:11:32.428
只是他的頭上，被我們用鏟子
打了的地方，流了一點血，


2369
01:11:28.966 --> 01:11:32.428
His head's just a little bloody
from where we hit him with the shovel,


2370
01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:35.556
我發誓湯姆開槍的時候并不知道槍里上了子彈

2371
01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:35.556
And l swear when Tom shot the gun off,
he didn't think it was loaded


2372
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:38.976
是我把子彈上回去的，
所以只要你們都進來...


2373
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:38.976
'cause l put the bullets back in,
so if you'll all just step inside,


2374
01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:41.228
...就知道這里沒有任何人死了

2375
01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:41.228
you'll see there's nobody dead here,

2376
01:11:41.312 --> 01:11:43.230
他可能暫時有點呼吸困難

2377
01:11:41.312 --> 01:11:43.230
He may have had the wind
knocked out of him temporarily,


2378
01:11:43.314 --> 01:11:45.816
不過只要經過一點緊急護理，
我想他就會沒事的


2379
01:11:43.314 --> 01:11:45.816
but with a little first aid,
l think he'll be just fine,


2380
01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:48.402
(screaming))

2381
01:11:48.485 --> 01:11:50.279
(screaming))

2382
01:11:50.362 --> 01:11:55.576
- (screams))
- (screams))


2383
01:11:55.659 --> 01:11:57.703
老天爺﹗

2384
01:11:55.659 --> 01:11:57.703
Holy mother of God!

2385
01:12:00.164 --> 01:12:01.498
漢斯﹗

2386
01:12:00.164 --> 01:12:01.498
(Lisa)) Hans!

2387
01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:03.792
是的，我知道，我知道

2388
01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:03.792
Yes, l see, l see,

2389
01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:05.919
行，好的

2390
01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:05.919
- (squeaks))
- OK, fine,


2391
01:12:06.003 --> 01:12:07.212
噢﹗

2392
01:12:06.003 --> 01:12:07.212
- (squawking))
- Whoa!


2393
01:12:07.296 --> 01:12:09.840
能再說一次嗎﹖信號不好﹗

2394
01:12:07.296 --> 01:12:09.840
Could you say that again?
You're breaking up!


2395
01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:15.137
請稍等，OJ﹗

2396
01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:15.137
One moment, please, OJ!

2397
01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.056
(tires screeching))

2398
01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:29.276
我不懂你為什么要這樣做，漢斯，你怎么想的﹖

2399
01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:29.276
l just can't understand why you would
do this, Hans, what were you thinking?


2400
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.737
他會沒事的，也許會有點喉嚨痛

2401
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.737
He'll be fine, He may complain
about a sore throat,


2402
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.406
不過他的情況比這吊燈可好多了

2403
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.406
but he's in a lot better shape
than this chandelier,


2404
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:35.949
等這家的主人回來，我可不愿再呆在這里

2405
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:35.949
Well, l'd hate to be here
when the owner gets back,


2406
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.827
你可以到時候再說一次

2407
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.827
You can say that again,

2408
01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:40.371
哇哦

2409
01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:40.371
- (man)) Whoa!
- (car horn))


2410
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.375
- 湯姆﹗爸爸﹗
- 又怎么了﹖


2411
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.375
- Tom! Daddy!
- What do we got?


2412
01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:46.627
- 怎么回事﹖
- 當心玻璃，大家小心


2413
01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:46.627
- What was that?
- Watch the glass, OK, everybody?


2414
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.712
- 我們把他們從車里弄出來
- 噢，天吶，爸爸﹗


2415
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.712
- Let's get 'em out of the car,
- Oh, my God! Daddy!


2416
01:12:48.796 --> 01:12:51.006
- 大家退后，保持鎮靜
- 你們都沒事吧﹖


2417
01:12:48.796 --> 01:12:51.006
- Everybody, stay back and remain calm,
- (Lisa)) Are you all right?


2418
01:12:51.048 --> 01:12:53.342
就是他，就是他透過矮樹叢窺視我

2419
01:12:51.048 --> 01:12:53.342
That's him, That's the one spying
on me through the bushes,


2420
01:12:53.384 --> 01:12:55.552
他開槍打碎了我女儿茱莉的臥室窗戶

2421
01:12:53.384 --> 01:12:55.552
He shot the bullet right through
my Julie's bedroom window,


2422
01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:58.681
來呀，告訴他們，茱莉

2423
01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:58.681
Here, Tell 'em, Julie,

2424
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:02.101
你們過來，湯姆要把這家伙放在這

2425
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:02.101
You guys, Tom wants the body in here,

2426
01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:04.687
慢慢來，放我下來

2427
01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:04.687
- (TJ)) Take it easy, Put me down,
- (gasps))


2428
01:13:06.063 --> 01:13:09.525
斯坦菲爾德，你做了什么好事﹖

2429
01:13:06.063 --> 01:13:09.525
Stansfield, what have you done?

2430
01:13:09.608 --> 01:13:13.195
麗莎，收拾行李，你跟我一起去泰國

2431
01:13:09.608 --> 01:13:13.195
Lisa, pack your things,
You're coming with me to Thailand,


2432
01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:17.741
不行﹗

2433
01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:17.741
No!

2434
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.496
把他帶走﹗
（Get his ass out of here）


2435
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.496
Get his ass out of here,

2436
01:13:22.579 --> 01:13:26.583
你還提“屁股”這詞，真是好笑，杰克

2437
01:13:22.579 --> 01:13:26.583
lt's funny you should mention
the word ''ass'', Jack,


2438
01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:29.712
為何我們不先說說你的事﹖

2439
01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:29.712
Why don't we start
by talking about yours,


2440
01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:30.754
你說什么﹖

2441
01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:30.754
Excuse me?

2442
01:13:30.838 --> 01:13:34.883
麗莎，你爸爸不是你想象的那樣子

2443
01:13:30.838 --> 01:13:34.883
Lisa, your father is not
who you think he is,


2444
01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:39.680
整個出版業務，是一個巧妙的掩護

2445
01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:39.680
The whole publishing operation,
lt's a great cover,


2446
01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:43.726
你是怎么辦到的﹖你怎么弄的﹖
把書挖空﹖


2447
01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:43.726
Now how'd you do it? What'd you do?
Did you hollow out the books?


2448
01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:48.230
噢，還把工厂設在泰國，真是天才﹗

2449
01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:48.230
Oh, and locating the plant
in Thailand, lt's genius!


2450
01:13:49.481 --> 01:13:53.569
- 你都在說些什么﹖
- 我說的...杰克


2451
01:13:49.481 --> 01:13:53.569
- What are you talking about?
- What am l,,, Jack,


2452
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:58.365
你知道嗎，我一直相信你，杰克，
直到遇見這個人


2453
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:58.365
You know, l-l would've believed
you, Jack,,, until l met this man,


2454
01:13:58.449 --> 01:14:00.617
他好像對你的底細很了解

2455
01:13:58.449 --> 01:14:00.617
who seems to know a lot about ya,

2456
01:14:02.494 --> 01:14:07.958
認得這個嗎﹖我听說它對治療毛囊炎
非常有效


2457
01:14:02.494 --> 01:14:07.958
Recognize this? l hear it's very
effective in relieving folliculitis,


2458
01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:11.170
我沒生毛囊炎

2459
01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:11.170
l don't have folliculitis,

2460
01:14:11.253 --> 01:14:14.923
他讓我別無選擇

2461
01:14:11.253 --> 01:14:14.923
He's given me no choice,

2462
01:14:14.965 --> 01:14:16.800
- 他讓我別無選擇﹗
- 湯姆，你干什么﹖


2463
01:14:14.965 --> 01:14:16.800
- He's given me no choice!
- Tom, what are you doing?


2464
01:14:16.884 --> 01:14:19.595
- 這太瘋狂了﹗
- 是嗎﹖看看你老爸的屁股


2465
01:14:16.884 --> 01:14:19.595
- This is insane!
- Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass,


2466
01:14:19.637 --> 01:14:21.430
- 不﹗
- 然后再說我是不是瘋了，嗯﹖


2467
01:14:19.637 --> 01:14:21.430
- No!
- Then tell me l'm insane, huh?


2468
01:14:21.513 --> 01:14:25.976
- 噢﹗噢﹗
- 嗯﹖嗯﹖看呀﹗


2469
01:14:21.513 --> 01:14:25.976
- (all) Oh! Ooh!
- Huh? Huh? Look at it!


2470
01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.646
看呀﹗嗯﹖嗯﹖

2471
01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.646
Look at it! Huh? Huh?

2472
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:30.648
- 啊﹗
- 怎么﹖


2473
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:30.648
- Ooh,,,
- What?


2474
01:14:35.444 --> 01:14:37.446
噢，太惡心了

2475
01:14:35.444 --> 01:14:37.446
(man)) Oh, that's nasty,

2476
01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:48.332
我說了我沒生毛囊炎，你這個十足的白痴

2477
01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:48.332
l told you l don't have folliculitis,
you blithering idiot,


2478
01:14:48.374 --> 01:14:54.129
各位，一定是這藥膏起效了

2479
01:14:48.374 --> 01:14:54.129
Well, guys, the ointment
must have worked,


2480
01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:56.340
走吧

2481
01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:56.340
Let's go,

2482
01:14:56.423 --> 01:15:00.719
慢著﹗我給你們看樣東西

2483
01:14:56.423 --> 01:15:00.719
Wait! l have something to show ya,

2484
01:15:02.513 --> 01:15:04.682
噢﹗

2485
01:15:02.513 --> 01:15:04.682
(all) Oh!

2486
01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:05.975
(Hans)) What's with this movie
and the ass cheeks?


2487
01:15:06.058 --> 01:15:11.355
我的真名叫小杰克.泰勒，萊德是我的綽號

2488
01:15:06.058 --> 01:15:11.355
My real name is Jack Taylor,,, Jr,
Red is my nickname,


2489
01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:15.359
現在你們知道為什么了，我就是TJ來此的原因

2490
01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:15.359
Now you know why,
l'm the whole reason that TJ's here,


2491
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:19.488
該死的，萊德，你在我的房子里做毒品買賣﹗

2492
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:19.488
Goddamn it, Red, You've been
dealing drugs out of my house!


2493
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:23.617
不，爸爸，我發誓，我給這家伙的是一包面粉

2494
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:23.617
No, Dad, l swear,
l gave this guy a bag of flour,


2495
01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:27.037
我把一公斤真的毒品倒進馬桶了

2496
01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:27.037
l dumped a kilo of the real stuff
down the toilet,


2497
01:15:27.079 --> 01:15:29.206
我再也不賣毒品了

2498
01:15:27.079 --> 01:15:29.206
l'm finished dealing for good,

2499
01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:32.459
木制墊子的那個萊檬綠色的馬桶﹖

2500
01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:32.459
The lime green toilet
with the wooden seat?


2501
01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:35.629
沒錯，怎么了

2502
01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:35.629
- Yeah, why?
- (squawking))


2503
01:15:35.713 --> 01:15:45.713
噢﹗

2504
01:15:35.713 --> 01:15:45.713
(all) Ooh!

2505
01:15:46.557 --> 01:15:48.183
哇﹗

2506
01:15:46.557 --> 01:15:48.183
(all) Whoa!

2507
01:15:48.225 --> 01:15:52.980
等等，他在飛﹗

2508
01:15:48.225 --> 01:15:52.980
Wait a second, He's flying,

2509
01:15:53.063 --> 01:15:55.899
他在飛﹗

2510
01:15:53.063 --> 01:15:55.899
He's flying,

2511
01:15:59.778 --> 01:16:02.114
(squawking))

2512
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:06.702
哇﹗

2513
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:06.702
(all) Whoa!

2514
01:16:09.705 --> 01:16:10.956
- (OJ squeals))
- (car horn))


2515
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.501
- (tires screeching))
- (crash))


2516
01:16:15.502 --> 01:16:21.258
我不想再看到他，立刻﹗
麗莎，我們走


2517
01:16:15.502 --> 01:16:21.258
Get him out of my sight, Now,
Lisa, let's go,


2518
01:16:23.469 --> 01:16:26.055
就是他，搶了我的耳朵﹗
伊万德.霍利菲爾德的耳朵


2519
01:16:23.469 --> 01:16:26.055
That's the one, He got my ear!
Evander Holyfield's ear,


2520
01:16:26.138 --> 01:16:28.849
你有權保持沉默，你所說的一切將...

2521
01:16:26.138 --> 01:16:28.849
You have to right to remain silent,
Anything you say can and,,,


2522
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.768
麗莎，等等﹗

2523
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.768
Lisa, wait!

2524
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:33.520
老天，是霍利菲爾德的耳朵

2525
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:33.520
(Arthur) That's Holyfield's ear
for God's sake,


2526
01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:36.565
(thunder rolling))

2527
01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:57.836
OJ﹖

2528
01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:57.836
- (squawking))
- OJ?


2529
01:16:59.421 --> 01:17:04.718
OJ，到我這里來，小寶貝你怎么樣﹖

2530
01:16:59.421 --> 01:17:04.718
OJ! Come to Daddy,
How's my little boy?


2531
01:17:06.845 --> 01:17:10.057
(squawking))

2532
01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:24.613
- 你要跟他走﹖
- 我有別的選擇嗎﹖他需要我


2533
01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:24.613
- You're going with him?
- What choice do l have? He needs me,


2534
01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:27.282
你真的同情他﹖

2535
01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:27.282
Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

2536
01:17:27.366 --> 01:17:30.911
他在操縱你，你居然能接受這种事

2537
01:17:27.366 --> 01:17:30.911
He's manipulating you
and you are buying it,


2538
01:17:31.787 --> 01:17:35.666
好吧，行，隨便你怎么做好了，
不過我要把湯姆保釋出來


2539
01:17:31.787 --> 01:17:35.666
All right, fine, You do what you gotta do,
l am gonna bail Tom out of jail,


2540
01:17:35.749 --> 01:17:36.792
錢呢﹖用你賣毒品的錢﹖

2541
01:17:35.749 --> 01:17:36.792
With what? Your drug money?

2542
01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:38.919
不，不，不，這是我從老爸的保險箱里偷的

2543
01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:38.919
No, no, no, l stole
this out of Dad's safe,

2544
01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:42.047
听著，重要的是，必須有人幫助湯姆

2545
01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:42.047
Look, the important thing is,
somebody has gotta help Tom,


2546
01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:45.801
你知道昨晚發生的事沒有一件是他的錯

2547
01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:45.801
You know that nothing that happened
here last night was any of his fault,


2548
01:17:45.843 --> 01:17:50.347
真搞笑，這個全世界最友善的家伙卻是
唯一有勇气...


2549
01:17:45.843 --> 01:17:50.347
lt's funny, The nicest guy in the world's
the only one with enough balls


2550
01:17:50.431 --> 01:17:52.725
...反抗我們老爸的人

2551
01:17:50.431 --> 01:17:52.725
to stand up to Dad,

2552
01:17:56.061 --> 01:18:00.316
他唯一想要的就是和你共度一段時光

2553
01:17:56.061 --> 01:18:00.316
All he wanted to do was
to spend some time with you,


2554
01:18:00.357 --> 01:18:02.526
結果給他帶來了什么﹖

2555
01:18:00.357 --> 01:18:02.526
Look what it gets him,

2556
01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:07.448
真是個模范老爸，我被禁止進入這房子，
而你被禁止离開這房子


2557
01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:07.448
Classic Dad, l'm not allowed in the
house, you're not allowed out of it,


2558
01:18:07.531 --> 01:18:10.951
他不關心我們，他只關心那只蠢鳥

2559
01:18:07.531 --> 01:18:10.951
He doesn't care about us,
Only that stupid bird,


2560
01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:15.998
- 嘿，萊德，我能告訴你一件事嗎﹖
- 當然可以


2561
01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:15.998
- Hey, Red, can l tell you something?
- Sure,


2562
01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:20.586
我知道這听上去很怪异，
但是從我還是個小孩子開始...


2563
01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:20.586
l know this is gonna sound weird,
but ever since l was a little kid,,,


2564
01:18:22.796 --> 01:18:27.593
...我就一直希望自己變成那只蠢鳥

2565
01:18:22.796 --> 01:18:27.593
l used to always wish
that l was that stupid bird,


2566
01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.638
啊

2567
01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.638
Aw,

2568
01:18:30.721 --> 01:18:34.224
(squawks))

2569
01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:41.357
听著，我覺得該是你跟老爸談談的時候了

2570
01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:41.357
Look, l think it's about time
you talk to Dad,


2571
01:18:41.398 --> 01:18:45.194
至少告訴他你的感受，你能做到的

2572
01:18:41.398 --> 01:18:45.194
At least tell him how you feel,
You can do it,


2573
01:18:45.235 --> 01:18:46.654
(grunts))

2574
01:18:46.737 --> 01:18:49.573
(yells))

2575
01:18:49.657 --> 01:18:53.369
你還不明白嗎﹖我們沒道理要畏懼他﹖

2576
01:18:49.657 --> 01:18:53.369
Don't you see, we have no reason
to be afraid of him?


2577
01:18:53.452 --> 01:18:55.496
啊﹗

2578
01:18:53.452 --> 01:18:55.496
- Aah!
- (screaming))


2579
01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:57.498
啊﹗

2580
01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:57.498
Aah!

2581
01:18:58.832 --> 01:19:06.215
啊﹗

2582
01:18:58.832 --> 01:19:06.215
(grunting)) Aah!

2583
01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:07.383
- (yells))
- (thud)


2584
01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:12.262
- 爸爸﹗
- 麗莎，別讓他這樣對你


2585
01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:12.262
- Daddy!
- Lisa, don't let him do this to you,


2586
01:19:12.346 --> 01:19:16.558
麗莎﹗啊﹗

2587
01:19:12.346 --> 01:19:16.558
Lisa! Aah!

2588
01:19:37.037 --> 01:19:40.207
- 麗莎﹗
- 湯姆﹗


2589
01:19:37.037 --> 01:19:40.207
- Lisa!
- Tom!


2590
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:44.003
萊德把我保釋出來了，他告訴我你在這，
我不會讓你走的


2591
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:44.003
Red bailed me out,,, and told me you
were here and l'm not letting you go,


2592
01:19:44.128 --> 01:19:46.588
- 但我...
- 不，你讓我說完


2593
01:19:44.128 --> 01:19:46.588
- Yeah, but l'm,,,
- No, You're gonna let me finish,


2594
01:19:46.672 --> 01:19:50.134
昨晚是一場惡夢，都是我自己造成的，
因為是我讓他們那樣對我的


2595
01:19:46.672 --> 01:19:50.134
l went through hell last night and it was
my fault 'cause l let people do it to me,


2596
01:19:50.217 --> 01:19:51.969
現在你在犯同樣的錯誤

2597
01:19:50.217 --> 01:19:51.969
And now you're gonna
make the same mistake,


2598
01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:53.762
- 但是...
- 這不是你想要的


2599
01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:53.762
- Yeah, but,,,
- This isn't what you want,


2600
01:19:53.804 --> 01:19:56.807
這是你爸爸想要的，還有，你知道嗎﹖

2601
01:19:53.804 --> 01:19:56.807
This is what your father wants,
And you know what?


2602
01:19:56.890 --> 01:20:02.980
也許你和我永遠不會在一起，
這讓我很傷心


2603
01:19:56.890 --> 01:20:02.980
Maybe you and l,,, never
are gonna work, And that hurts,


2604
01:20:03.063 --> 01:20:07.276
但是看著你被一個無情的暴君控制著，
這讓我更傷心


2605
01:20:03.063 --> 01:20:07.276
But not as much as watching you
be controlled by a ruthless tyrant


2606
01:20:07.318 --> 01:20:09.945
如果他以為這樣會有助于他的成功，讓他見鬼去吧

2607
01:20:07.318 --> 01:20:09.945
that would screw his own mother
if he thought it'd help him get ahead,,,


2608
01:20:09.987 --> 01:20:19.987
湯姆﹗我沒說要走

2609
01:20:09.987 --> 01:20:19.987
Tom! l'm not going,

2610
01:20:21.498 --> 01:20:23.542
她...她不走

2611
01:20:21.498 --> 01:20:23.542
She's-she's not going,

2612
01:20:26.754 --> 01:20:30.716
這點對你而言就這么難以理解，斯坦菲爾德﹖

2613
01:20:26.754 --> 01:20:30.716
ls this whole concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?


2614
01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:45.147
不會，不會

2615
01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:45.147
No, No,

2616
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:47.816
好啊

2617
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:47.816
All right, (chuckles))

2618
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.195
什么...我...是什么讓你留下來的﹖

2619
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.195
Wha,,, l,,, What made you stay?

2620
01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:01.288
這個

2621
01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:01.288
That,

2622
01:21:08.087 --> 01:21:14.134
- 你們是怎么...
- 我們終于進行了一次早就該進行的促膝長談


2623
01:21:08.087 --> 01:21:14.134
- How did you guys,,,
- We finally had our long overdue talk,


2624
01:21:14.885 --> 01:21:17.805
那...那誰接替你在泰國的職位﹖

2625
01:21:14.885 --> 01:21:17.805
Then-then who's taking
your place in Thailand?


2626
01:21:17.888 --> 01:21:19.515
他

2627
01:21:17.888 --> 01:21:19.515
- He is,
- (gong))


2628
01:21:19.598 --> 01:21:20.891
- 這是什么﹖
- 啊﹗


2629
01:21:19.598 --> 01:21:20.891
- What's this?
- (neck cracks)) Ow!


2630
01:21:20.975 --> 01:21:24.228
- 我和你鬧著玩的
- 我不想去，我害怕


2631
01:21:20.975 --> 01:21:24.228
- l'm kidding,
- l don't wanna go, l'm afraid,


2632
01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:27.356
胡說，每個人都知道...

2633
01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:27.356
Nonsense, Everyone knows that, uh,,,

2634
01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:30.734
...亞洲人很害怕...

2635
01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:30.734
Asian people are very
intimidated by, uh,,,


2636
01:21:30.818 --> 01:21:32.861
- 高個子﹖
- 加拿大人﹖


2637
01:21:30.818 --> 01:21:32.861
- Tall men?
- Canadians?


2638
01:21:32.903 --> 01:21:35.656
- 共和党人﹖
- 黑人﹖


2639
01:21:32.903 --> 01:21:35.656
- Republicans?
- Blacks?


2640
01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:37.491
- 漢德森﹖
- 是，先生


2641
01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:37.491
- Henderson?
- Yes, sir,


2642
01:21:37.574 --> 01:21:39.284
我不允許公司里有這种思想

2643
01:21:37.574 --> 01:21:39.284
l won't have that kind of thinking
in this company,


2644
01:21:39.368 --> 01:21:42.246
這里沒有种族主義生存的空間，你被解雇了

2645
01:21:39.368 --> 01:21:42.246
There's no room for racism here,
You're fired,


2646
01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:47.042
好了，湯姆，我要說的重點是，
由于公司里有一大部分人要去泰國


2647
01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:47.042
Now, Tom, the point that l'm getting to
is that with a big part of the team away,


2648
01:21:47.084 --> 01:21:49.878
所以我要讓你接管創意部

2649
01:21:47.084 --> 01:21:49.878
l'm gonna want you to take over
the Creative Department,


2650
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.214
- 我﹖
- 不用謙讓


2651
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.214
- Me?
- No need to be modest,


2652
01:21:52.256 --> 01:21:55.300
我看了你留在臥室里的那些构思

2653
01:21:52.256 --> 01:21:55.300
l saw those ideas you left
in the living room,


2654
01:21:55.384 --> 01:22:00.180
你關于肯尼迪刺殺案的推論，很有道理，
還有關于登月是一個騙局的推論﹖


2655
01:21:55.384 --> 01:22:00.180
Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant,
And the moon landing, a hoax?


2656
01:22:00.264 --> 01:22:02.349
你真是有不少重大發現啊

2657
01:22:00.264 --> 01:22:02.349
You're really on to something there,

2658
01:22:02.433 --> 01:22:06.437
這正是銷售書籍的人該有的思維方式

2659
01:22:02.433 --> 01:22:06.437
That's the kind of thinking
that's gonna sell books,


2660
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.441
謝謝，先生

2661
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.441
Uh, thank you, sir,

2662
01:22:10.524 --> 01:22:14.153
再見，爸爸，一路平安

2663
01:22:10.524 --> 01:22:14.153
Bye, Daddy, Have a safe flight,

2664
01:22:17.573 --> 01:22:22.119
爸爸，妙极了，你提拔了湯姆

2665
01:22:17.573 --> 01:22:22.119
Well, Dad,,, that's fantastic,
You promoted Tom,


2666
01:22:22.202 --> 01:22:25.748
是的，我認為有膽子在我的波斯地毯上撒尿的人...

2667
01:22:22.202 --> 01:22:25.748
Yeah, well, l figure anyone who's got
the guts to piss on my Persian carpet


2668
01:22:25.789 --> 01:22:30.627
...一定具備了成功的必要條件。
斯坦菲爾德﹗


2669
01:22:25.789 --> 01:22:30.627
has gotta have what it takes,
Stansfield!


2670
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:34.006
(trickling))

2671
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:41.305
- 你到底在干什么﹖
- 我在設法要回我的工作，先生

2672
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:41.305
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just trying to get my job back, sir,

- (Lisa squeals))
- (chuckles))


2675
01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:50.314
在發生所有這些事之后，在經歷了這一切之后

2676
01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:50.314
(Tom)) You know, after everything
that happened, after all I went through,


2677
01:22:50.356 --> 01:22:54.318
我想那天真是我的幸運日。
而且我不是唯一一個幸運的人


2678
01:22:50.356 --> 01:22:54.318
I guess it was my lucky day.
And I'm not the only one.


2679
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.403
按照麗莎和萊德的提議

2680
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.403
Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

2681
01:22:56.487 --> 01:22:59.073
杰克從上到下改組了公司

2682
01:22:56.487 --> 01:22:59.073
Jack restructured the company
from top to bottom.


2683
01:22:59.156 --> 01:23:02.785
甚至把禮拜五穿便服的制度改成了
每天都可以穿便服


2684
01:22:59.156 --> 01:23:02.785
Even instituting casual
Fridays every day.


2685
01:23:02.868 --> 01:23:06.080
上禮拜五是漢德森連續第27天工作...

2686
01:23:02.868 --> 01:23:06.080
And last Friday was Henderson's

2687
01:23:06.163 --> 01:23:07.665
...期間沒有被解雇過

2688
01:23:06.163 --> 01:23:07.665
without being fired.

2689
01:23:07.748 --> 01:23:10.751
OJ戒掉了毒癮，現在他只喝啤酒了

2690
01:23:07.748 --> 01:23:10.751
OJ's back off the drugs
and now he only drinks beer.


2691
01:23:10.834 --> 01:23:12.795
(burps))

2692
01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:15.506
不過他偶爾還是會想起過去的事情

2693
01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:15.506
(chuckles)) But he still has
an occasional flashback.


2694
01:23:15.589 --> 01:23:18.133
(squawks))

2695
01:23:18.175 --> 01:23:20.678
杰克懇求奧德莉回來上班，
不過她已經找到工作了


2696
01:23:18.175 --> 01:23:20.678
Jack begged Audrey to come back,
but she got a job


2697
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:22.721
居然是在咖啡館上班

2698
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:22.721
at, of all places, a coffee shop.

2699
01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:25.140
- 噢﹗
- 噢﹗


2700
01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:25.140
- Ew!
- Ugh!


2701
01:23:26.934 --> 01:23:28.936
- 噢﹗
- 噢﹗


2702
01:23:26.934 --> 01:23:28.936
- Ew!
- Ew!


2703
01:23:29.019 --> 01:23:31.814
太難喝了

2704
01:23:29.019 --> 01:23:31.814
This is terrible!

2705
01:23:31.855 --> 01:23:35.484
漢斯已經成功開始運轉公司設在泰國的工厂

2706
01:23:31.855 --> 01:23:35.484
Hans succeeded in turning around
the company's factory in Thailand.


2707
01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:38.028
不過顯然他仍然在努力地适應當地習俗

2708
01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:38.028
But apparently he's still struggling
to cope with the local customs.


2709
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:40.489
- 坐到后面去﹗
- 什么﹖


2710
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:40.489
- Back of bus!
- Excuse me?


2711
01:23:40.531 --> 01:23:43.909
- 你們這种人要坐在后面
- 你侮辱我﹗


2712
01:23:40.531 --> 01:23:43.909
- You people belong back of bus,
- That's an outrage!


2713
01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:46.870
老兄，我不會讓你這樣對待我，就因為我...

2714
01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:46.870
Man, l'm not gonna let you treat me
like that merely because l'm,,,


2715
01:23:46.912 --> 01:23:49.790
吸煙﹗要吸煙就坐到后面去﹗

2716
01:23:46.912 --> 01:23:49.790
Smoking! Smokers belong back of bus!

2717
01:23:49.873 --> 01:23:52.835
(coughing))

2718
01:23:52.918 --> 01:23:55.129
至于我，升職之后

2719
01:23:52.918 --> 01:23:55.129
As for me, with my new promotion,

2720
01:23:55.212 --> 01:23:58.173
終于有机會將我自己的經歷寫成書

2721
01:23:55.212 --> 01:23:58.173
I could at last write books
based on my own experiences.


2722
01:23:58.257 --> 01:23:59.675
- 于是我寫了
- 謝謝


2723
01:23:58.257 --> 01:23:59.675
- So I did.
- Thank you,


2724
01:23:59.717 --> 01:24:03.512
麗莎也終于能夠從事她自己喜歡的職業

2725
01:23:59.717 --> 01:24:03.512
And Lisa was finally able to pursue
a career that she loved.


2726
01:24:03.595 --> 01:24:06.432
有句老話，你們都曾听人說過﹕

2727
01:24:03.595 --> 01:24:06.432
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression.:

''Why does everything bad
always happen to me?''


2730
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:13.772
我無法認同他們，因為我已經知曉，
只要他們肯停下腳步...


2731
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:13.772
Well, I don't get those people...
'cause I've learned that if they just stop


2732
01:24:13.856 --> 01:24:20.571
...查看一下，他們就會認識到，凡事皆有因

2733
01:24:13.856 --> 01:24:20.571
and look around, they'd realize
that everything happens for a reason.
