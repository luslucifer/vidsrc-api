1
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:33.482
Takuma Toshiro.

2
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.815
You're an actor.

3
00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.107
An action film actor, right?

4
00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.690
He's just wrapped his debut film <i>BIRTH</i>.

5
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.898
He's the star and action director.

6
00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:02.815
I'm honored to be interviewing
Takuma Toshiro.


7
00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:03.773
Thank you.

8
00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.690
I hear you're trained in
"Assassination-jutsu,"


9
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.607
and also something called
"Zero Range Combat."


10
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.898
That's right, and they're disciplines
I intend to master.


11
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:15.982
I pursue things to the extreme.
It's pointless otherwise.


12
00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:20.023
I think the best word to
describe him is "Samurai."


13
00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:23.482
One day I heard some actor
wanted to meet me.


14
00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.232
He came in wearing a black hoodie.

15
00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.273
"Who's this f***er?"

16
00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.607
"You're an actor! 
What can I teach you?"

17
00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:31.232
Well, that's what I thought.

18
00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:34.148
I first saw him at
one of our MMA tournaments.


19
00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:35.565
He'd entered as a fighter.

20
00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:37.773
I thought, "What's an actor doing here?"

21
00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:40.107
But he kicked ass
with moves I'd never seen.


22
00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:42.482
I had to admit he was something else.

23
00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:46.898
Wouldn't you have to be a war veteran
to master "Assassination-jutsu"?


24
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.898
I do have battlefield experience, actually.

25
00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:53.023
Film sets are a war zone.

26
00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:58.690
He was so edgy.

27
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.648
He's in a category all of his own.

28
00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:02.398
That dude's crazy.

29
00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:03.523
He's insane.

30
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.523
For an actor, he's too hardcore.

31
00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:09.773
I've heard you could kill anyone
with ease if you wanted to.


32
00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:13.065
Of course, I can kill people,

33
00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:15.273
but I can keep them alive, too.

34
00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:17.982
But everything is in service of my films.

35
00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:19.857
I'm an action film actor.

36
00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:24.898
My understanding of action films
was that they shoot several takes,


37
00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.190
then they edit the footage
to make it look action-packed.


38
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.273
I don't think of him as
an "Action Film Actor" at all.


39
00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:34.273
But I heard Toshiro shoots his scenes
in one take.


40
00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:37.232
It must be tough for his co-stars.

41
00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:39.065
They need the same skill level.

42
00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:43.190
He took my Zero Range techniques and
developed a discipline he calls "Wave."


43
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.065
He stretches his body beyond
the limits of average men.


44
00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.857
He's incredibly quick and agile.

45
00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:51.482
In my opinion,
in every action film made so far,


46
00:02:52.357 --> 00:02:55.440
everyone just follows the choreography.
They're dancing.


47
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:56.857
Dancing?

48
00:02:57.523 --> 00:03:00.982
In normal acting,
there's an element of realism, right?


49
00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:06.023
But when it comes to action films,
you can't find realism anywhere.


50
00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:08.607
It's hard to define "real."

51
00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:11.773
In the world of
MMA, we fight for real.

52
00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:14.690
But we're not trying to
murder the other guy.


53
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.690
We fight within the rules.

54
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.190
He's not a "Martial Artist," either.

55
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.815
For example, take the line "Good morning."

56
00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:24.440
Anybody can deliver that with reality.

57
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.982
But in an action film,
everyone suddenly goes:


58
00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.940
"Punch. Punch." It's so stiff.

59
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.107
Why is there no realism in action?

60
00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:36.482
No matter how much I thought about it,
it just didn't feel right.


61
00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.940
That's why I started to learn
the real deal.


62
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.607
I've trained him alongside guys from JSDF,
and my military buddies.


63
00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:47.898
He does things the military guys can't,
without any fuss.


64
00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:50.148
He is something special.

65
00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:52.815
If you asked me if
he was "The Real Deal,"

66
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.315
I'd have to say yes.

67
00:03:56.107 --> 00:03:58.232
You don't get what I'm saying?

68
00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:02.315
Tatsuya. Koji. Come here.

69
00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:03.565
I'll show you.

70
00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:08.357
<i>If he stopped obsessing over movies,
and action and whatever...</i>


71
00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:11.648
If he ever wanted to join us,
and work on our side of the fence,


72
00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.273
our doors would be wide open.

73
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:15.440
That's how highly I value him.

74
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.815
I'd beat him, if
it was in the ring.

75
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:19.523
If the rules were clear.

76
00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:22.065
But if we were on the street,

77
00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:23.148
fighting for real,

78
00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:26.315
we'd have to keep going
until one of us died.


79
00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:29.065
Okay. Come at me for real.

80
00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.440
I told you to come for real.

81
00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:45.982
You guys are pathetic.

82
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.857
When I say for real, 
I mean for real.

83
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:53.440
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is:

84
00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:56.940
I want to train my co-stars in
"Realism Action,"


85
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.940
and make a "100% Pure Action Film."

86
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.190
I guarantee I'll make it!

87
00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:05.190
When it's ready, come interview me again.

88
00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.357
<i>Scene 78,</i>

89
00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:13.773
Take 15!

90
00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:15.482
<i>Ready...</i>

91
00:05:16.273 --> 00:05:17.482
<i>Action!</i>

92
00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:18.732
Heave ho!

93
00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:40.482
Switch!

94
00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:43.648
Take this!

95
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:57.482
Take this!

96
00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:04.898
Sorry.

97
00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:07.607
This won't work in one take.

98
00:06:07.607 --> 00:06:08.940
I'll do some close-ups.

99
00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:12.523
Cut!

100
00:06:13.148 --> 00:06:14.607
<i>Amazing!</i>

101
00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:18.190
Way to go, Junpei.

102
00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:21.148
Let's get you some water.

103
00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:26.148
Dumb it down for him.

104
00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.690
Aren't you a pro?

105
00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.607
Toshiro's keeping quiet today.

106
00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:36.982
It's his first film in ages.
He can't screw up.


107
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.190
If Mr. Shin didn't get him this gig
for old time's sake,


108
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.898
we wouldn't be here either.

109
00:06:42.898 --> 00:06:44.107
You're so right.

110
00:06:44.898 --> 00:06:47.065
I'm an action film actor.

111
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.190
It's been so long, 
I nearly forgot.

112
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.232
Actor?

113
00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:52.523
You're just a stuntman.

114
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.190
Idiot.

115
00:06:54.482 --> 00:06:56.648
Hey. That cuts deep.

116
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.107
Tatsuya, this looks bad...

117
00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:02.857
- No way.
- Where's Mr. Shin?


118
00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:04.273
We have to find him!

119
00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:06.273
What did you just say?

120
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.565
I didn't say a thing.

121
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:09.898
Know what?

122
00:07:10.273 --> 00:07:11.732
I've heard the rumors.

123
00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:14.773
You think everyone else's
action work is pathetic.


124
00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:16.190
You say it's just dancing.

125
00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:18.648
So you think I'm pathetic too?

126
00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:21.857
I learned how to direct in Hong Kong.
They call me "Sir Tony."


127
00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:24.648
And you still think I'm pathetic?

128
00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:27.690
No, I don't.

129
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.648
You think wire action is just
people whizzing around?


130
00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:32.315
It's all a joke to you?

131
00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:34.982
Never crossed my mind.

132
00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:36.357
Listen up.

133
00:07:36.357 --> 00:07:40.357
Why do people watch action films?
It's not for the realism.


134
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:42.440
All they want is fantasy.

135
00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:45.232
If it's flashy and cool, they're happy!

136
00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.023
There's a word for what you do.

137
00:07:47.023 --> 00:07:48.315
"Niche."

138
00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:49.565
What's this film?

139
00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:50.565
"Mainstream."

140
00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:53.440
Are we clear?

141
00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:56.940
Toshiro?

142
00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:58.398
Hey!

143
00:07:58.398 --> 00:07:59.523
You listening?

144
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.857
What's bugging you so much?

145
00:08:12.732 --> 00:08:16.565
Aren't you playing the middle boss
in this film?


146
00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:19.357
It's not a bad role at all.

147
00:08:19.648 --> 00:08:20.732
Right?

148
00:08:21.732 --> 00:08:22.815
I must admit.

149
00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:25.357
<i>BIRTH</i> was a hit.

150
00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:28.857
The DVDs sold well.
You went to all the festivals.


151
00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:30.523
But when was that?

152
00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:32.232
10 years ago.

153
00:08:32.232 --> 00:08:34.398
The world's changed since then.

154
00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:35.940
I know.

155
00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:38.565
Of course, I know you well.

156
00:08:39.357 --> 00:08:41.190
You're Mr. Stoic.

157
00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.690
You're always training
and building your repertoire.


158
00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.773
What's that thing you do?

159
00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:49.148
It's called something... murder?

160
00:08:49.148 --> 00:08:50.357
"Assassination-jutsu."

161
00:08:53.022 --> 00:08:57.190
Everyone respects how you developed
that "Wave" discipline of yours.


162
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.565
But you know.

163
00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:00.857
That makes no difference here.

164
00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:02.857
Who cares if it feels like a dance?

165
00:09:02.857 --> 00:09:05.232
Just hurry up and get the scene done.

166
00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:08.107
Isnâ€™t that what makes you a professional?

167
00:09:09.523 --> 00:09:11.523
- Yeah.
- Mr. Takuma, you're on!


168
00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:17.315
Hey!

169
00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:19.398
Old dude, wait up!

170
00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:21.398
Yeah, you.

171
00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:23.773
Old dude in the fuzzy clothes.

172
00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:25.940
Aren't you the guy from <i>BIRTH</i>?

173
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.023
I am.

174
00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:28.023
I knew it.

175
00:09:28.023 --> 00:09:30.940
I saw it so long ago,
I don't remember much of it.


176
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.815
But I know you pursue realism.
That's lit.


177
00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:36.607
And I know that thing you do.
Goes like this.


178
00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:38.523
- That "Tornado" thing.
- It's "Wave."


179
00:09:38.523 --> 00:09:39.982
- "Wave"?
- "Wave."


180
00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:41.982
Your "Wave" thing. 
That's lit, too.

181
00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.232
But guess what.

182
00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:46.107
I'm a martial artist, too.
So, when we're rolling--


183
00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:47.232
Tell me.

184
00:09:47.565 --> 00:09:50.398
What's the difference between
"Martial Arts" and "Action"?


185
00:09:59.523 --> 00:10:01.190
Scene 85, Take 1.

186
00:10:01.607 --> 00:10:02.898
<i>Ready...</i>

187
00:10:04.857 --> 00:10:06.023
<i>Action!</i>

188
00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:34.690
Cut, cut, cut!

189
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.857
That's not how we rehearsed it.

190
00:10:36.857 --> 00:10:38.607
Let's go once more.

191
00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:39.690
Once more.

192
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.773
Sorry.

193
00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.232
Take a break.

194
00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:44.190
Sure. Good idea.

195
00:10:44.523 --> 00:10:45.648
Let's take a break!

196
00:13:45.273 --> 00:13:47.690
- That's it. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


197
00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:52.482
Wait!

198
00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:55.815
<i>I'm Akira.</i>

199
00:13:56.398 --> 00:13:59.107
<i>I joined Toshiro's team
just a few months ago.</i>


200
00:13:59.482 --> 00:14:01.148
<i>But before I knew it,</i>

201
00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:03.190
<i>I was his only apprentice.</i>

202
00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:13.482
<i>When I found the training too hard
and nearly gave up, Toshiro told me:</i>


203
00:14:13.815 --> 00:14:16.107
<i>"When life gets tough,
turn the other cheek.</i>


204
00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:19.065
<i>Even if your tears are streaming down it."</i>

205
00:14:25.273 --> 00:14:28.565
There are many martial artists
in the world,


206
00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:32.357
but only one in every hundred
are able to master their art.


207
00:14:32.648 --> 00:14:34.232
They are the chosen ones.

208
00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.273
They are the One
-Percenters.

209
00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.857
It's the tale of a man
who goes all the way.


210
00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:42.565
That poster...

211
00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:46.357
There's a film I was supposed to shoot
after <i>BIRTH</i>.


212
00:14:46.857 --> 00:14:48.357
This is the teaser poster.

213
00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:53.065
We'll use this as a motif
for our new film.


214
00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:54.315
New film?

215
00:14:55.523 --> 00:14:57.440
That last shoot opened my eyes.

216
00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.565
If I'm going to master
"The Way of Real Action,"


217
00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:03.398
I have to do it myself.

218
00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:06.357
But that will be expensive.
How will you finance it?


219
00:15:06.357 --> 00:15:08.607
If we shoot one scene a day,
it can be done.


220
00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:10.232
You need a story and a script.

221
00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:12.607
It's been in my head
for the last ten years.


222
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.732
If I perform real action,
that will be a drama in itself.


223
00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:23.273
Now I think about it,
it's been 10 years since <i>BIRTH</i>.


224
00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:27.940
I pursued the Way of Real Action
all alone, without much success.


225
00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:31.315
But it's time I did what I want.

226
00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.940
The gods have slapped me into action.

227
00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:36.273
And I'm not alone now.

228
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.357
I have you.

229
00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:41.065
Let's do it.

230
00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:45.065
Let's make an authentic real action film!

231
00:15:47.315 --> 00:15:50.523
<i>"This film isn't just about
unfinished business.</i>


232
00:15:50.523 --> 00:15:54.398
<i>I'm going to display all the techniques
I perfected over the past 10 years!"</i>


233
00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:55.940
<i>So Toshiro swore.</i>

234
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.732
<i>The first is "Wave."</i>

235
00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.857
<i>You should never punch
with just your fists.</i>


236
00:16:00.857 --> 00:16:04.565
<i>Stretch your shoulder blades and
roll them to emit a wave-like blow.</i>


237
00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:07.857
<i>With Wave, you don't need to
wind up a punch.</i>


238
00:16:07.857 --> 00:16:10.398
<i>It even works at "zero range."</i>

239
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.773
Give it to me.

240
00:16:34.357 --> 00:16:37.523
Now let's show you a real Wave punch.

241
00:16:38.857 --> 00:16:39.982
Here goes.

242
00:16:49.648 --> 00:16:51.857
<i>Films need an ideal location.</i>

243
00:16:52.357 --> 00:16:54.732
<i>With a great location, great ideas flow.</i>

244
00:16:54.732 --> 00:16:57.065
<i>It helps you get
a great cast and crew too.</i>


245
00:16:57.648 --> 00:17:00.773
<i>I ran around pitching
like my life depended on it.</i>


246
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.398
Today's lesson is for pros.
"Dodging Bullets with Wave."


247
00:17:08.648 --> 00:17:10.190
Did you say "Bullet"?

248
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.190
Like from a gun?

249
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.023
Shoot at me with all you have.

250
00:17:23.023 --> 00:17:26.315
<i>Of course, nobody can dodge a bullet
after it's fired.</i>


251
00:17:26.315 --> 00:17:29.356
<i>But if you watch closely,
you can tell when they'll shoot.</i>


252
00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:31.023
<i>Their eyes dart.</i>

253
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:34.773
<i>When you nail that,
you use Wave to move just in time.</i>


254
00:17:34.773 --> 00:17:36.690
<i>You shift your "median plane."</i>

255
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.982
Idiot!

256
00:17:47.982 --> 00:17:51.023
Who shoots with their eyes closed?
You grazed my cheek.


257
00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:52.732
Now it's your turn.

258
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.898
Median plane.

259
00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.107
Median plane.

260
00:18:00.523 --> 00:18:01.523
Median plane.

261
00:18:01.773 --> 00:18:05.732
Median plane.

262
00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:07.857
Median plane.

263
00:18:24.232 --> 00:18:25.482
<i>BIRTH.</i>

264
00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:28.857
Let me be frank. 
That was a great film.

265
00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:33.773
Thinking about it now, it's one of
Japan's greatest cult films ever.


266
00:18:33.773 --> 00:18:35.523
But it was ahead of its time.

267
00:18:36.232 --> 00:18:39.357
Let me be frank.
Despite how I look, I'm a film buff.


268
00:18:39.607 --> 00:18:43.232
So, I really am interested in
this new film of yours.


269
00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:49.482
Thank you.

270
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.607
But be careful.
Locations can be expensive.


271
00:18:53.898 --> 00:18:55.398
It's all about the money.

272
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.440
What's your budget?

273
00:18:57.773 --> 00:19:00.523
Well, let me be frank...

274
00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:15.357
Stop wasting my time.

275
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.565
Mr. Kanda!

276
00:19:21.232 --> 00:19:22.398
Mr. Kanda...

277
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.898
Everyone has turned us down.

278
00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:27.857
I have nobody else to turn to.

279
00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:30.273
Please!

280
00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:42.398
Now that you mention it,

281
00:19:42.398 --> 00:19:44.565
one place does come to mind.

282
00:19:45.023 --> 00:19:46.357
If I can be frank.

283
00:19:48.357 --> 00:19:52.273
<i>Let me be frank. You won't find
many locations better than this.</i>


284
00:19:52.648 --> 00:19:56.315
<i>It used to be a zinc factory,
built before the war.</i>


285
00:19:56.607 --> 00:20:00.398
<i>Surprisingly enough, it was still
running until just a few years ago.</i>


286
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.273
<i>Of course, there's no electricity.
No cell phone reception either.</i>


287
00:20:05.648 --> 00:20:07.732
<i>But let me be frank.</i>

288
00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:10.065
<i>It has a few issues.</i>

289
00:20:10.898 --> 00:20:13.440
<i>I'll need the introduction fee up front.</i>

290
00:20:13.732 --> 00:20:16.482
<i>Non-cancelable. Non-refundable.
No matter what.</i>


291
00:20:16.857 --> 00:20:18.190
<i>Be frank. Like it?</i>

292
00:20:30.482 --> 00:20:32.023
Hey, start recording.

293
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:33.232
Yes sir!

294
00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:38.357
Huh?

295
00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:53.940
Give me more!

296
00:20:55.232 --> 00:20:56.190
More!

297
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.857
You must act divinely!

298
00:20:58.982 --> 00:21:02.732
This film is the tale of a man
who challenges the gods.


299
00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:04.607
We're portraying karma!

300
00:21:05.273 --> 00:21:07.648
Fight like you're dancing!

301
00:21:08.482 --> 00:21:10.440
Try basing it on...

302
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.607
I know!

303
00:21:12.357 --> 00:21:14.732
<i>The Nutcracker.</i>

304
00:21:21.565 --> 00:21:23.273
They really are dancing.

305
00:21:27.232 --> 00:21:28.690
Cut, cut, cut!

306
00:21:31.398 --> 00:21:32.982
Brothers!

307
00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:35.982
What a coincidence.

308
00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:39.732
Who do we have here?

309
00:21:40.273 --> 00:21:41.357
I've got this.

310
00:21:43.148 --> 00:21:44.940
What are you doing here?

311
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.232
- What about you?
- Exactly as it looks.


312
00:21:47.482 --> 00:21:49.940
I'm shooting a storyboard.

313
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.607
It's a Chinese-funded blockbuster.
With a simultaneous worldwide release.


314
00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:56.565
And the director is the one and only...

315
00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:58.190
<i>Ta-da!</i>

316
00:21:58.898 --> 00:22:00.357
Kinameri Sunao.

317
00:22:03.857 --> 00:22:06.607
Don't tell me...
You know Kinameri Sunao, right?


318
00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:08.857
At the Montreal World Film Festival
he was--


319
00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:09.773
Nope.

320
00:22:12.023 --> 00:22:13.023
Sorry.

321
00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:14.523
No, no.

322
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.815
I'm getting the sense that fellow and I
live in completely different worlds.


323
00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:23.273
More importantly, we have this island!

324
00:22:23.815 --> 00:22:25.815
I absolutely love it!

325
00:22:27.148 --> 00:22:28.523
Sign the final contract.

326
00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:31.690
What do you mean by "Final contract"?

327
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.440
We came scouting for a location.

328
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.398
Then it's time to give up.

329
00:22:35.398 --> 00:22:39.232
We've been in prep for six months
through a coordinator called Kanda.


330
00:22:39.898 --> 00:22:41.357
Kanda?

331
00:22:41.357 --> 00:22:42.440
He screwed us.

332
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.857
The bigger surprise is that
someone actually gave you a job.


333
00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:47.523
Is it direct-to-video?

334
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.107
Streaming only?

335
00:22:50.065 --> 00:22:51.315
Don't tell me...

336
00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:52.773
It might be an indie film.

337
00:22:55.023 --> 00:22:56.690
You're shooting an indie film?

338
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.690
Shut up!

339
00:22:58.107 --> 00:23:01.023
Compared to that pansy's dance film,

340
00:23:01.023 --> 00:23:04.648
my Real Action film is
a million times more fun.


341
00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:10.398
Okay, I like this place.
We're definitely gonna shoot here.


342
00:23:11.398 --> 00:23:12.732
Stop screwing around.

343
00:23:12.982 --> 00:23:14.732
We got here first.

344
00:23:57.982 --> 00:23:59.232
Keep moving.

345
00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:02.690
Give up!

346
00:24:06.982 --> 00:24:07.982
Come here!

347
00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:10.523
Come with us!

348
00:24:11.482 --> 00:24:12.565
Well, well.

349
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.732
Am I seeing things?

350
00:24:26.357 --> 00:24:27.982
- Check it out.
- Yes sir.


351
00:24:27.982 --> 00:24:28.898
Let's go.

352
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.523
- Go with him!
- Yes sir.


353
00:24:36.857 --> 00:24:38.232
I'm calling the cops.

354
00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:40.815
Don't be an idiot! 
There's no reception!

355
00:24:50.315 --> 00:24:51.107
Huh?

356
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.732
If I make it out alive...

357
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.023
If you make it out alive,

358
00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:29.523
this experience will bring
your film to life like no other.


359
00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:34.440
This might be our film's
greatest chance ever.


360
00:25:35.523 --> 00:25:36.607
Toshiro.

361
00:25:37.732 --> 00:25:39.982
You don't get the reality!

362
00:25:39.982 --> 00:25:41.482
Films are fiction.

363
00:25:41.482 --> 00:25:43.398
Make-believe. Get it?

364
00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:46.607
Hey.

365
00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:48.315
Let's flee while we can.

366
00:25:48.315 --> 00:25:49.357
Okay.

367
00:26:01.982 --> 00:26:03.565
Film the whole thing.

368
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.232
I will!

369
00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:13.690
Come on!

370
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:14.773
Move it!

371
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.190
You traitor!

372
00:26:22.857 --> 00:26:25.232
You swore loyalty to my father!

373
00:26:25.232 --> 00:26:26.732
The old man's dead.

374
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.732
The moral code no longer applies.

375
00:26:29.648 --> 00:26:30.648
Tell me.

376
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:32.357
Where are the goods?

377
00:26:33.857 --> 00:26:34.898
Spit it out!

378
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.107
You can act tough.

379
00:26:38.773 --> 00:26:41.023
But wasting time will only
make things worse.


380
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.107
I had a call
from my guy in Tokyo.

381
00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:47.023
Arachnid are headed for this island.

382
00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.898
- Arachnid?
- Yeah.


383
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.065
If we don't leave soon,
we're all in trouble.


384
00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:55.440
Spit it out!

385
00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.065
Where are the goods?

386
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.523
Who the hell are you?

387
00:27:10.482 --> 00:27:11.482
Listen up.

388
00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:13.148
When you knock them down,

389
00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:15.773
if they get back up, it's not enough.

390
00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:35.232
Toshiro!

391
00:27:36.148 --> 00:27:37.273
Don't worry.

392
00:27:37.273 --> 00:27:38.732
I'm just knocking him out.

393
00:27:50.898 --> 00:27:53.148
I could kill you right now.

394
00:27:54.273 --> 00:27:55.523
But I won't.

395
00:27:56.148 --> 00:27:57.440
Know why?

396
00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:05.565
Because I'm an action film actor.

397
00:28:12.523 --> 00:28:13.565
I knew it.

398
00:28:13.898 --> 00:28:15.190
He's insane.

399
00:28:15.898 --> 00:28:17.482
What do we do now?

400
00:28:19.273 --> 00:28:21.440
Our boat comes later tonight.

401
00:28:21.773 --> 00:28:24.398
Until then, we'll hide near the shore,

402
00:28:24.398 --> 00:28:25.732
and hang in there.

403
00:28:45.232 --> 00:28:47.065
What are you doing here?

404
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.065
Who are you?

405
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.482
No way!

406
00:29:04.482 --> 00:29:05.732
No damn way!

407
00:29:21.982 --> 00:29:23.982
This guy is insane!

408
00:29:24.898 --> 00:29:25.940
Koji!

409
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.315
This way, Koji!

410
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.732
Wait.

411
00:29:31.398 --> 00:29:33.023
They'll hear us.

412
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:37.440
Didn't you say nobody comes
to this island?


413
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.107
They have nowhere to hide.

414
00:29:41.107 --> 00:29:42.940
Let's just get this done.

415
00:29:53.857 --> 00:29:55.065
Let's go.

416
00:29:56.523 --> 00:29:58.440
My name's Maria.

417
00:29:59.315 --> 00:30:03.690
My father was Chairman of Kurokawa-kai,
the organized crime syndicate.


418
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.065
He passed away a few days ago
from a sudden illness.


419
00:30:08.565 --> 00:30:10.982
The in-fighting began right away.

420
00:30:12.315 --> 00:30:15.232
They're fighting over
my father's inheritance.


421
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:18.773
That's why they're here?

422
00:30:19.065 --> 00:30:20.190
Yes.

423
00:30:20.732 --> 00:30:22.607
But it's not money.

424
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.773
His inheritance is the two tons of cocaine
he hid on this island.


425
00:30:28.398 --> 00:30:29.607
Cocaine?

426
00:30:30.607 --> 00:30:31.690
Yes.

427
00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:40.398
Well, your friends have arrived.

428
00:30:56.732 --> 00:30:57.773
Oh my.

429
00:30:58.565 --> 00:30:59.690
What's this?

430
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.732
Uncle Takenouchi, stop spewing such crap.

431
00:31:18.523 --> 00:31:19.898
I'm telling the truth.

432
00:31:20.648 --> 00:31:22.773
A stranger came in punching.

433
00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:24.607
He took out everyone.

434
00:31:25.232 --> 00:31:26.315
Are you telling me...

435
00:31:26.982 --> 00:31:28.482
Jackie Chan's here?

436
00:31:30.982 --> 00:31:32.190
I'm not lying.

437
00:31:32.898 --> 00:31:34.023
Believe me.

438
00:31:35.023 --> 00:31:37.565
His henchmen all say the same thing.

439
00:31:38.773 --> 00:31:40.523
There's a boogeyman here?

440
00:31:41.023 --> 00:31:42.690
That's a bit hard to believe.

441
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.065
What about Maria?

442
00:31:47.482 --> 00:31:48.648
Where is she?

443
00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:51.565
I think... he has her...

444
00:31:55.898 --> 00:31:57.023
He's spoken.

445
00:31:57.565 --> 00:31:58.565
Right.

446
00:32:01.982 --> 00:32:03.357
Takenouchi...

447
00:32:04.607 --> 00:32:08.565
I brought all my guns
thinking you and I would have a war.


448
00:32:09.523 --> 00:32:11.773
But this has ended so easily.

449
00:32:12.773 --> 00:32:14.148
Thanks to Jackie.

450
00:32:16.607 --> 00:32:17.773
Wait.

451
00:32:17.773 --> 00:32:18.773
Shishido...

452
00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:20.857
Please.

453
00:32:21.357 --> 00:32:22.940
When you arrive in hell,

454
00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:25.815
say hi to the old man for me.

455
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.148
This is getting interesting.

456
00:32:44.648 --> 00:32:45.815
Time to go.

457
00:32:49.523 --> 00:32:51.190
Who are those guys?

458
00:32:53.315 --> 00:32:55.857
"Arachnid" is Shishido's private army.

459
00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:59.232
He recruits retired commandos
with no place to go.


460
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.440
They're an assassination squad.

461
00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:05.315
They did all of Kurokawa-kai's dirty work.

462
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.940
But a few years ago, my father started
worrying Shishido was out of control.


463
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.232
He cut all ties.

464
00:33:14.315 --> 00:33:17.190
Shishido has hated my father ever since.

465
00:33:17.482 --> 00:33:20.315
He's been waiting to take vengeance
upon Kurokawa-kai.


466
00:33:22.065 --> 00:33:23.315
And the brat?

467
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.648
Regroup with the squad outside,

468
00:33:27.357 --> 00:33:30.815
then split into three teams
and start combing the building.


469
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:35.398
Our targets are the chairman's daughter
and the mysterious guy.


470
00:33:35.815 --> 00:33:39.315
Assume the mysterious guy
has combatant training.


471
00:33:39.982 --> 00:33:41.232
Exert caution.

472
00:33:41.732 --> 00:33:43.357
Don't harm Maria.

473
00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:47.648
If she gets even one scratch,

474
00:33:48.607 --> 00:33:50.148
I'll gouge your eyes out.

475
00:33:52.982 --> 00:33:54.190
Daddy...

476
00:33:58.482 --> 00:34:00.065
I think you should watch out.

477
00:34:00.732 --> 00:34:03.273
Not even the real Jackie could do this.

478
00:34:05.482 --> 00:34:06.607
Right.

479
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.732
This way.

480
00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:26.232
As it turns out,
he was the real deal.

481
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:28.107
- What?
- Yes.


482
00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:32.190
Where can we hide
on such a small island?

483
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.648
We'll get caught before long.

484
00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:36.440
If we're gonna die anyway...

485
00:34:37.607 --> 00:34:38.857
You know what?

486
00:34:39.107 --> 00:34:40.815
Those were my thoughts exactly.

487
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:42.440
- Hey.
- Cut it out.


488
00:34:43.732 --> 00:34:45.982
What are you guys talking about?

489
00:34:46.523 --> 00:34:47.732
Sorry, Tony.

490
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:50.773
Thank you!

491
00:34:51.023 --> 00:34:52.398
Let's go.

492
00:34:52.398 --> 00:34:53.440
Hey!

493
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.315
Wait!

494
00:34:59.773 --> 00:35:01.107
For real?

495
00:35:03.815 --> 00:35:04.982
<i>BIRTH</i>?

496
00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:07.148
I know that film.

497
00:35:07.148 --> 00:35:09.357
My father watched it so many times.

498
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.940
Now it makes sense.

499
00:35:12.357 --> 00:35:14.523
I thought I'd seen you somewhere.

500
00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:16.482
Happened a long time ago.

501
00:35:20.565 --> 00:35:22.273
Hide here for a while.

502
00:35:23.565 --> 00:35:24.607
What about you?

503
00:35:25.482 --> 00:35:27.315
They're professional killers.

504
00:35:27.315 --> 00:35:29.023
This needs a professional response.

505
00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:31.107
Assassination-jutsu?

506
00:35:31.523 --> 00:35:35.065
For us to get out alive, they must be
taken out as quickly as possible.


507
00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:37.773
I need to do this alone.

508
00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:40.398
Okay?

509
00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:18.232
What happened, Team Wesley?

510
00:38:19.315 --> 00:38:20.523
Do you copy?

511
00:38:22.065 --> 00:38:23.815
<i>Do you copy, 
Team Wesley?</i>

512
00:38:26.482 --> 00:38:28.357
<i>Team Wesley, do you copy?</i>

513
00:38:29.773 --> 00:38:31.273
Can you hear me?

514
00:38:33.857 --> 00:38:35.023
I can.

515
00:38:39.398 --> 00:38:40.940
So you're Shishido?

516
00:38:42.732 --> 00:38:44.690
I don't believe we've met,

517
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.940
Jackie Chan.

518
00:38:46.523 --> 00:38:49.023
Jackie? I think I prefer Bruce Lee.

519
00:38:49.482 --> 00:38:52.857
<i>I don't have time to play
with military cosplaying yakuza.</i>


520
00:38:53.357 --> 00:38:54.732
Who exactly are you?

521
00:38:55.482 --> 00:38:57.440
Are you a syndicate hitman?

522
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.732
<i>Or a law enforcement officer?</i>

523
00:38:59.732 --> 00:39:01.357
Neither of those, actually.

524
00:39:01.648 --> 00:39:04.690
<i>Then could you try minding
your own business?</i>


525
00:39:05.148 --> 00:39:08.107
I hate it when my men get injured
for nothing!


526
00:39:08.732 --> 00:39:11.482
I live up to my fans' expectations.
That's my job.


527
00:39:13.357 --> 00:39:14.357
Fans?

528
00:39:17.315 --> 00:39:19.815
I look forward to seeing you later.
Bye.


529
00:39:20.273 --> 00:39:21.898
<i>Wait. Don't switch off.</i>

530
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.357
How do you know Maria?

531
00:39:27.232 --> 00:39:28.773
At least tell me that.

532
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.565
Like I said. She's a fan.

533
00:39:33.565 --> 00:39:34.398
<i>Huh?</i>

534
00:39:34.398 --> 00:39:35.690
What are you...

535
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.232
Daddy, did you hear that?

536
00:39:41.232 --> 00:39:42.607
<i>Of course, I did.</i>

537
00:39:43.398 --> 00:39:44.648
Then you know.

538
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.732
Find that Kung Fu freak and slaughter him.

539
00:39:48.398 --> 00:39:49.898
Roger.

540
00:39:54.815 --> 00:39:56.148
Sensei.

541
00:43:09.898 --> 00:43:12.940
Team Alvin, Team Mickey,
maintain your distance!


542
00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:14.398
We're coming!

543
00:43:26.815 --> 00:43:30.023
Judging by his handiwork,
he's a mercenary or an assassin.


544
00:43:32.565 --> 00:43:34.857
But he didn't finish them off.

545
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.357
Who the hell is he?

546
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.565
Jackie...

547
00:43:48.565 --> 00:43:49.648
Men.

548
00:43:50.482 --> 00:43:53.982
You can leave now, with no pay.
You have three seconds.


549
00:43:55.148 --> 00:43:56.565
Three.

550
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.565
Two.

551
00:44:04.648 --> 00:44:06.148
As for their pay,

552
00:44:06.982 --> 00:44:08.732
it just got added to yours.

553
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.065
Keep quiet.

554
00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:18.732
Sorry about that.

555
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.440
I heard a noise and came to check.

556
00:45:23.565 --> 00:45:25.398
Don't leave me alone again.

557
00:45:38.815 --> 00:45:42.190
I used to get bullied so badly.

558
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.440
It started in grade school.

559
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.440
I hated going to school so much,

560
00:45:48.982 --> 00:45:51.023
I even contemplated suicide.

561
00:45:53.232 --> 00:45:56.482
I wanted to be like the action stars
you see in movies.


562
00:45:56.732 --> 00:45:59.815
I wanted to live
as strong as they did.

563
00:46:01.107 --> 00:46:03.398
I just had to get stronger.

564
00:46:05.648 --> 00:46:08.482
Even someone like you
went through something like that.


565
00:46:09.565 --> 00:46:13.648
I was so desperate to get stronger,
I armed myself with all the techniques.


566
00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:19.357
But after a while I started thinking,
"What's the point of being strong?"


567
00:46:21.398 --> 00:46:24.732
Maybe not completely,
but I think I understand.


568
00:46:26.815 --> 00:46:29.982
I've lived with prejudice my whole life.

569
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.565
I was always surrounded by menacing men.

570
00:46:37.773 --> 00:46:39.440
That's why I tried so hard.

571
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.357
I had to follow the right path.
More than anyone else.


572
00:46:46.648 --> 00:46:49.023
But that's not natural.

573
00:46:51.523 --> 00:46:52.982
One day I realized,

574
00:46:53.398 --> 00:46:56.232
I had no idea who I really was.

575
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.648
I wonder where they are.

576
00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:04.273
Our real selves.

577
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.190
You think he's here?

578
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.940
Yes, I can sense someone.

579
00:47:20.482 --> 00:47:21.773
Keep your eyes open.

580
00:47:22.232 --> 00:47:23.315
Will do.

581
00:47:29.357 --> 00:47:31.148
They're on our side.

582
00:47:31.773 --> 00:47:33.023
You're safe now.

583
00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:39.148
Aren't we escaping together?

584
00:47:41.148 --> 00:47:43.732
I still have some unfinished business.

585
00:47:44.315 --> 00:47:45.440
So...

586
00:47:46.107 --> 00:47:47.273
Sorry.

587
00:47:50.482 --> 00:47:51.523
Toshiro?

588
00:47:52.107 --> 00:47:53.273
Who are you?

589
00:52:06.607 --> 00:52:08.065
What's that smell?

590
00:52:09.065 --> 00:52:11.107
It used to be a zinc factory.

591
00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:13.023
Really?

592
00:52:13.898 --> 00:52:15.190
It stinks.

593
00:52:22.565 --> 00:52:24.273
- Tell me.
- Yes?


594
00:52:24.982 --> 00:52:28.190
This island was still running
until a few years ago, right?


595
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.690
That's what I've heard.

596
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.648
Got a lighter?

597
00:52:46.607 --> 00:52:49.648
Jackie!

598
00:52:55.607 --> 00:52:56.523
Hey!

599
00:53:29.315 --> 00:53:31.857
Daddy, I hope you like fireworks.

600
00:53:58.232 --> 00:53:59.565
What was that?

601
00:54:01.315 --> 00:54:02.315
Look.

602
00:54:07.482 --> 00:54:08.523
Let's go.

603
00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:14.273
Tell us where Jackie went.

604
00:54:14.648 --> 00:54:15.690
Jackie?

605
00:54:16.107 --> 00:54:17.315
Who's that?

606
00:54:17.315 --> 00:54:19.232
Come with us. Shishido's waiting.

607
00:54:19.232 --> 00:54:21.357
- No!
- Don't make this difficult.


608
00:54:21.357 --> 00:54:22.482
Get back!

609
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.065
Tony!

610
00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:47.398
Don't yell before you attack.

611
00:55:03.107 --> 00:55:04.482
Hey.

612
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.648
Stop it!

613
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:17.648
We'll do as you say.

614
00:56:17.648 --> 00:56:20.607
I'll tell you where the cocaine is.
Just don't kill him!


615
00:56:25.565 --> 00:56:26.648
Really?

616
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.315
Maria's there?

617
00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:10.398
Is that Jackie's?

618
00:57:34.398 --> 00:57:36.440
I'm Shishido's daughter, Ami.

619
00:57:36.815 --> 00:57:37.940
Nice to meet you.

620
00:57:42.565 --> 00:57:43.732
I've heard of you.

621
00:57:47.148 --> 00:57:48.732
Don't kill them.

622
00:57:52.982 --> 00:57:54.273
Of course not.

623
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:08.565
Toshiro will definitely get you.

624
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.732
You'll see.

625
00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:26.607
Mr. Shishido.

626
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:30.190
Look.

627
00:58:33.815 --> 00:58:35.315
What the hell is this?

628
00:58:37.065 --> 00:58:38.607
<i>Everything is in service of my films.</i>

629
00:58:39.065 --> 00:58:40.482
<i>I'm an action film actor.</i>

630
01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:08.273
So, Maria...

631
01:00:08.982 --> 01:00:11.065
How did you like your dad?

632
01:00:12.482 --> 01:00:13.857
My father...

633
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.273
I love my daddy.

634
01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:18.732
He does whatever I ask.

635
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.107
But...

636
01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:24.690
He made two mistakes.

637
01:00:25.982 --> 01:00:27.398
Know what he did?

638
01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:33.982
He killed my mom in an accident.

639
01:00:35.482 --> 01:00:37.648
That's when I lost my leg.

640
01:00:40.565 --> 01:00:41.940
That's his first mistake.

641
01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:46.690
The second one is...

642
01:00:50.023 --> 01:00:52.440
He created someone like me.

643
01:00:57.232 --> 01:00:58.065
Let's go.

644
01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.315
Here?

645
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:40.898
I'm not sure, but my father said
it was in this warehouse.


646
01:01:43.398 --> 01:01:44.648
Oh, no.

647
01:01:45.023 --> 01:01:47.148
My daddy will be so disappointed.

648
01:01:48.273 --> 01:01:49.732
But I don't care.

649
01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.065
To be honest,
I don't care about the cocaine.


650
01:01:56.148 --> 01:01:58.440
My true goal is...

651
01:02:03.357 --> 01:02:05.315
Maria, it's you.

652
01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:14.607
We're both the daughters of murderers.

653
01:02:16.982 --> 01:02:18.607
It's not our fault.

654
01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:20.940
Kids can't choose their parents.

655
01:02:23.357 --> 01:02:26.482
All I wanted was someone who understood.

656
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:30.898
I just wanted a friend.

657
01:02:39.357 --> 01:02:41.107
You know how I feel.

658
01:02:42.148 --> 01:02:43.315
Right?

659
01:02:45.607 --> 01:02:47.773
How many people have you killed?

660
01:02:49.357 --> 01:02:50.898
You're insane!

661
01:02:51.273 --> 01:02:53.732
You're a lunatic who kills for fun!

662
01:02:55.357 --> 01:02:56.982
It's not just your father.

663
01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.273
You're the same.

664
01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:03.273
Don't say that.

665
01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:12.690
I thought you of all people
would understand.


666
01:03:17.523 --> 01:03:18.648
Ami!

667
01:03:25.315 --> 01:03:26.690
What's wrong?

668
01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:31.857
It's nothing.

669
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:34.940
What happened to your face?

670
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.023
Did Jackie get you?

671
01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:40.440
We were annihilated.

672
01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:45.982
He wiped everybody out.

673
01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.732
That stupid action film actor.

674
01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:50.107
What is he?

675
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.482
An action film actor.

676
01:03:56.023 --> 01:03:57.940
So, he really was Jackie Chan.

677
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.315
Anyway, where are the goods?

678
01:04:02.648 --> 01:04:05.732
Daddy, this is a
bit hard to say, but...

679
01:04:06.565 --> 01:04:09.315
It looks like old Kurokawa duped us.

680
01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:12.190
Huh? What's going on?

681
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:13.940
Gotta admire the old guy.

682
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.857
Do you know what that means?

683
01:04:16.232 --> 01:04:17.815
Without the goods,

684
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:19.815
we are done for!

685
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.440
Tell me.

686
01:04:27.357 --> 01:04:28.815
What's going on?

687
01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:32.065
I don't know. I just...

688
01:04:32.857 --> 01:04:34.023
Stop it, Daddy.

689
01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:36.732
It must be somewhere on this island.

690
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.732
Dead or alive,

691
01:04:39.148 --> 01:04:41.357
I'll drag you around until we find it!

692
01:04:41.357 --> 01:04:42.732
Stop it, Daddy.

693
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.357
I told you to stop!

694
01:04:51.648 --> 01:04:52.607
Shut up!

695
01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:03.607
Ami...

696
01:05:10.732 --> 01:05:12.107
That was your fault.

697
01:05:13.815 --> 01:05:15.315
I told you to stop.

698
01:05:15.857 --> 01:05:18.148
You said you'd do whatever I asked.

699
01:05:18.898 --> 01:05:19.940
Liar.

700
01:05:30.898 --> 01:05:32.148
You're Jackie?

701
01:05:36.107 --> 01:05:37.898
I came, just as I promised.

702
01:05:38.648 --> 01:05:40.107
One thing first.

703
01:05:40.398 --> 01:05:42.607
If you're after the cocaine,
it's not here.


704
01:05:42.607 --> 01:05:43.857
You're not even close.

705
01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.482
You want to be
a hero and save Maria?

706
01:05:46.482 --> 01:05:47.523
Wrong again.

707
01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:50.232
Then I've no idea at all.

708
01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:51.940
Tell me why you're here.

709
01:05:53.065 --> 01:05:54.815
If you want a real answer...

710
01:05:57.273 --> 01:05:58.773
I don't know myself.

711
01:06:00.773 --> 01:06:01.898
He makes no sense.

712
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:03.857
This is too much.

713
01:06:04.815 --> 01:06:06.523
Deal with him, Sensei.

714
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.565
Why are you guys hitting it off?

715
01:11:48.357 --> 01:11:51.065
This isn't an action flick, asshole.

716
01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:17.898
Daddy,

717
01:12:19.107 --> 01:12:20.398
is this...

718
01:12:27.607 --> 01:12:28.940
I see.

719
01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.482
He stashed it in the plaster.

720
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.857
The old man thought that one through.

721
01:12:47.398 --> 01:12:49.232
The credits are already rolling.

722
01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:53.273
You shitty actor.

723
01:12:54.898 --> 01:12:56.148
Toshiro!

724
01:12:59.648 --> 01:13:01.982
Akira, why are you here?

725
01:13:07.732 --> 01:13:10.440
I made myself a promise.

726
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.565
No matter what,

727
01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:16.273
I'd always follow in your footsteps.

728
01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:18.857
But now,

729
01:13:19.898 --> 01:13:22.607
just this once,
can I take a step forward?


730
01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:27.023
Let me say this.

731
01:13:28.232 --> 01:13:31.190
It is time for you to change.

732
01:13:33.732 --> 01:13:37.940
I remember when you told me
about the "One-Percenters."


733
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.982
Those who've gone all the way.

734
01:13:42.565 --> 01:13:44.232
If you want to become one,

735
01:13:44.815 --> 01:13:46.190
you must change.

736
01:13:47.398 --> 01:13:50.940
You must allow yourself to do
that which you never did before.


737
01:13:52.107 --> 01:13:53.273
Allow what?

738
01:13:53.857 --> 01:13:55.565
Akira, what are you saying?

739
01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:01.023
Kill her.

740
01:14:06.065 --> 01:14:10.148
You did not train in your disciplines
to kill people.


741
01:14:10.398 --> 01:14:11.857
I know that.

742
01:14:13.232 --> 01:14:14.440
However...

743
01:14:16.065 --> 01:14:17.232
However...

744
01:14:18.982 --> 01:14:22.732
You cannot die at the hands
of trash like these.


745
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.398
That must not happen.

746
01:14:28.857 --> 01:14:30.148
Akira,

747
01:14:30.148 --> 01:14:31.273
stop it!

748
01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:34.690
Some people deserve to die.

749
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:35.815
Stop it!

750
01:14:36.148 --> 01:14:37.857
- Stop it!
- Go all the way!


751
01:14:41.232 --> 01:14:42.315
Do it.

752
01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:43.357
Stop it!

753
01:14:47.607 --> 01:14:49.565
Then I'll be your catalyst.

754
01:14:57.732 --> 01:14:59.148
Come on. Shoot me.

755
01:14:59.607 --> 01:15:01.398
You stupid brat!

756
01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:02.815
Okay.

757
01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:18.232
Guys that hit girls are scum.

758
01:15:34.815 --> 01:15:35.982
Cut!

759
01:15:37.815 --> 01:15:40.815
The next shot will be
Ami's last dying breath.


760
01:15:40.815 --> 01:15:43.148
Art department,
please get the blood ready.


761
01:15:43.148 --> 01:15:45.607
The cast can take a short break.

762
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.982
Way to go, Toshiro.

763
01:15:55.982 --> 01:15:58.357
That's the face of a man
"gone all the way."


764
01:15:58.357 --> 01:15:59.982
You had my blood curdling.

765
01:16:00.982 --> 01:16:03.648
Mr. Shin, I was thinking.

766
01:16:04.232 --> 01:16:07.857
I'm okay with Akira getting killed,
and killing Ami in return.


767
01:16:07.857 --> 01:16:10.773
But I think we could take it
somewhere else, too.


768
01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:14.190
- Akira?
- That would've been fine back in <i>BIRTH</i>.


769
01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.940
But this time around, we could take
a deeper look into their psyche.


770
01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.690
What are you talking about?
This is an action movie.


771
01:16:21.065 --> 01:16:23.815
Kill the bad guy at the end,
and everyone's happy.


772
01:16:23.815 --> 01:16:27.440
But if Akira gets killed,
using that as a trigger feels a little--


773
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.732
Toshiro!

774
01:16:30.398 --> 01:16:33.315
Who is this Akira you keep talking about?

775
01:16:43.023 --> 01:16:44.023
Toshiro.

776
01:16:44.732 --> 01:16:45.898
Toshiro!

777
01:16:47.607 --> 01:16:48.773
Toshiro!

778
01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:52.148
If you kill her,
you'll be no different from them.


779
01:16:57.732 --> 01:16:58.815
Akira?

780
01:16:59.607 --> 01:17:00.690
Akira?

781
01:17:03.482 --> 01:17:04.565
Akira!

782
01:17:14.482 --> 01:17:16.898
Tatsuya, Koji. Nice timing.

783
01:17:17.273 --> 01:17:19.148
I can't find Akira anywhere.

784
01:17:20.815 --> 01:17:23.398
See? It's just like we said.

785
01:17:24.148 --> 01:17:27.523
He really does believe it's true.

786
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.315
That he has a third trainee?

787
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.107
Yes.

788
01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:35.898
Toshiro calls him "Akira."

789
01:17:36.815 --> 01:17:38.898
I think he created this figure,

790
01:17:39.148 --> 01:17:43.482
because it was the only way he could
maintain his mental balance.


791
01:17:44.273 --> 01:17:46.440
He did it because he had to.

792
01:17:51.607 --> 01:17:54.232
<i>It's the tale of a man
who goes all the way.</i>


793
01:17:54.232 --> 01:17:56.357
<i>I'm not alone now. 
I have you.</i>

794
01:17:56.357 --> 01:17:57.523
<i>You grazed my cheek.</i>

795
01:17:57.523 --> 01:17:58.398
<i>Please!</i>

796
01:18:04.482 --> 01:18:05.607
<i>He screwed us.</i>

797
01:18:05.607 --> 01:18:07.148
<i>The in-fighting began.</i>

798
01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.023
<i>Okay?</i>

799
01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:11.273
<i>Don't leave me alone again.</i>

800
01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:19.190
Yes.

801
01:18:19.732 --> 01:18:22.898
Toshiro was alone
from the first time I saw him.


802
01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.815
When did I sense something was wrong?

803
01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:29.690
I didn't sense anything at all.

804
01:18:30.607 --> 01:18:34.648
But I was scared for my life,
and I was panicking...


805
01:18:35.148 --> 01:18:38.940
If Toshiro wasn't there,
I wouldn't have made it out alive.


806
01:18:39.773 --> 01:18:41.607
I'll be in his debt forever.

807
01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:44.190
Sure.

808
01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:49.732
The fact he was scouting alone
was a bit weird.


809
01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:53.690
But it's not totally unheard of
in the industry nowadays.


810
01:18:54.565 --> 01:18:56.940
When did he start getting weird?

811
01:18:57.607 --> 01:18:58.940
I don't know.

812
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.648
Probably from the day he was born.

813
01:19:04.857 --> 01:19:05.857
Sorry.

814
01:19:07.482 --> 01:19:08.607
Yes.

815
01:19:09.273 --> 01:19:11.648
When we arrived,

816
01:19:11.648 --> 01:19:14.690
Toshiro was just... standing there.

817
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:16.773
He was totally out of it.

818
01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:19.357
It's like he has no memory.

819
01:19:19.648 --> 01:19:22.982
Or maybe it's more like
he alters his memory.


820
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.982
Like I said,

821
01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:27.273
he didn't do anything wrong.

822
01:19:27.273 --> 01:19:28.773
He saved the day.

823
01:19:29.648 --> 01:19:31.023
So, why?

824
01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.023
Why keep hounding him?

825
01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.857
Takuma Toshiro.

826
01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:57.565
This is how you described
your own actions:


827
01:19:57.565 --> 01:19:59.523
"I just played my part."

828
01:19:59.523 --> 01:20:00.898
Is that right?

829
01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.482
You also said this:

830
01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:11.398
"There were strong people and bad people,
and they were all in the same place.


831
01:20:12.148 --> 01:20:13.732
That's all it was."

832
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.440
When you say "strong people"
are you talking about yourself?


833
01:20:24.732 --> 01:20:26.232
You're an actor.

834
01:20:26.982 --> 01:20:28.898
An action film actor, right?

835
01:20:59.565 --> 01:21:02.565
From here on,
I'll give you my personal opinion.


836
01:21:04.523 --> 01:21:05.773
Toshiro,

837
01:21:06.315 --> 01:21:08.107
I think you enjoyed it.

838
01:21:09.607 --> 01:21:13.148
You got to act like a movie superhero,
for real.


839
01:21:14.273 --> 01:21:15.440
But you know what?

840
01:21:15.732 --> 01:21:17.648
Movies aren't real life.

841
01:21:18.857 --> 01:21:22.648
You're only strong in your movies
because that's how you're portrayed.


842
01:21:22.648 --> 01:21:24.273
If you lose, it's over.

843
01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:27.607
You die. That's what happens in reality.

844
01:21:31.315 --> 01:21:34.273
For a person to
be strong in a film,

845
01:21:34.565 --> 01:21:36.857
they must be strong in real life.

846
01:21:37.398 --> 01:21:38.690
Huh?

847
01:21:40.273 --> 01:21:41.690
A One
-Percenter.

848
01:21:49.232 --> 01:21:51.482
Real action film actors are

849
01:21:53.357 --> 01:21:54.815
strong.

850
01:22:22.232 --> 01:22:23.898
