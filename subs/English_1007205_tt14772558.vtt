this is a joke.

respect the tradition

held by this group
for the last 400 years,

we'll make sure

[Jessica] Amber, I know it's
your first year here


393

and you think you're all that,

394
00:21:03.293 --> 00:21:04.494
but I really wouldn't
take this opportunity


395
00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:06.694
to join us for granted.

we take this very seriously,
okay?


401
00:21:17.427 --> 00:21:19.826
So, all you have to do
is go along with it

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.394
for a couple of nights,

403
00:21:21.427 --> 00:21:24.761

here are off the hook.

Oh my God, Charlotte.

My god, did I kill her?

1149
01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:44.493
Jesus, who killed her?
Who put her there like that?


1150
01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:48.226
I mean, who did that to her?

We didn't see Charlotte.
None of us.


1154
01:05:57.326 --> 01:05:59.493
We couldn't help Emily.

1155
01:05:59.526 --> 01:06:01.126
It was an accident.

1156
01:06:01.159 --> 01:06:03.159
It was nobody's fault with Em.

1157
01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:08.259
-This was your fault.

1158
01:06:08.293 --> 01:06:09.827
Your fault.

1159
01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:12.493
Kirsten's right.
You are a witch.


1160
01:06:12.526 --> 01:06:13.827
You conjured this thing up

1161
01:06:13.861 --> 01:06:15.526
and you better fucking
get rid of it!


1162
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.126
-Leave her alone.

1163
01:06:17.159 --> 01:06:18.192
-You shut up!

1164
01:06:18.226 --> 01:06:20.359
-What're you gonna do? Hmm?

1165
01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.259
Fix it, witch.

1166
01:06:24.426 --> 01:06:25.359
-I can't.

1167
01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:27.727
I don't know how.

1168
01:06:29.259 --> 01:06:32.159
-You must know.
What happened in the basement.


1169
01:06:32.192 --> 01:06:33.459
-What happened in the basement?

1170
01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:36.526
-And at the initiation.
You know it's Matthias.

-Who the fuck
is Matthias?

in the basement?

-Please, Amber.

1174
01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:42.594
We need you now.

1175
01:06:42.627 --> 01:06:44.861
-Who is Matthias?

1176
01:06:44.894 --> 01:06:46.661
[Kirsten]
The witch hunter.


1177
01:06:46.694 --> 01:06:50.493
He swore to kill any descendant
of Heather Gray.


1178
01:06:50.526 --> 01:06:51.827
He's hunting Amber.

1179
01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:54.694
He vowed that he would not stop

1180
01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:56.426
until he killed
the last witch in England.


1181
01:06:58.794 --> 01:07:00.226
-It was a bedtime story.

1182
01:07:02.426 --> 01:07:04.661
My mother would tell me over
and over again, the same one.


1183
01:07:06.259 --> 01:07:08.226
About a bad man
that would become a demon


1184
01:07:08.259 --> 01:07:10.226
and I'd fight him.

1185
01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.761
I just thought
it was a fairy tale,


1186
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:14.761
a really dark fairy tale.

1187
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:18.794
-That makes you
the last Gray witch.


1188
01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:20.326
-You should have told us.

1189
01:07:20.359 --> 01:07:22.126
You should never have joined us.

1190
01:07:23.393 --> 01:07:25.126
-I didn't know.

1191
01:07:25.159 --> 01:07:28.226
And I didn't want to join your
stupid coven anyway, remember?


1192
01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:30.794
I don't want to!
I did it for Kirsten.


1193
01:07:30.827 --> 01:07:33.092
[Alanda] Well, it's too late
for that now!


1194
01:07:33.126 --> 01:07:35.192
You just--you just need to
get us out of here.


1195
01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:36.561
[Kirsten] You conjured him up.

1196
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.426
There must be a way to return
him to. where--wherever.


1197
01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:42.359
-Well, find it. Fast.

1198
01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:45.459
I'm not going to die, not here,
not like. not like the others.


1199
01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:47.661
-Shut up. I need to think.

-We need to
get the lights on.


1202
01:07:51.627 --> 01:07:53.561
I'm not having her do
any spells in the dark.


1203
01:07:53.594 --> 01:07:55.426
And we need to be able
to see him.


1204
01:07:55.459 --> 01:07:57.827
He is using the dark
to hide from us.


1205
01:07:57.861 --> 01:07:59.092
I want to see what's happening.

1206
01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:02.694
You're right, Amber.

1207
01:08:02.727 --> 01:08:05.092
You don't need anybody.

1208
01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:06.627
You don't need friends.

1209
01:08:06.661 --> 01:08:08.527
You can't keep them.

1210
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:10.293
You just get them killed!

1211
01:08:11.727 --> 01:08:13.126
-I'll turn the genny on.

1212
01:08:13.159 --> 01:08:14.627
[Alanda] I'll go.

1213
01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:16.393
I'm stronger and faster.

1214
01:08:19.259 --> 01:08:21.661
It could have got us when we
were running back from the car.


1215
01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:23.393
But it didn't.

1216
01:08:23.426 --> 01:08:26.226
That must mean something, right?

1217
01:08:26.259 --> 01:08:27.126
Maybe it's had enough?
