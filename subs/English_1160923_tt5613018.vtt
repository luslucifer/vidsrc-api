had a choice of three weapons.

-What were the other two?
-Why do you wanna know?

and a lethal injection.

am I gonna do for pleasure?


497
00:26:04.725 --> 00:26:06.360
Look, I did what I did

498
00:26:06.393 --> 00:26:08.429
on my dark web network
for my entertainment.


499
00:26:08.462 --> 00:26:09.897
This guy, well,

500
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.065
he's doing it
for everyone else's.


501
00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:12.767
He's a showman, that's for sure.

502
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.535
-I wouldn't call him that.
-He would.


503
00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:15.803
So I won't.

504
00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:17.738
-You wanna provoke him?
-No.


505
00:26:18.105 --> 00:26:19.974
-I wanna kill him.
-Oh.


506
00:26:20.007 --> 00:26:22.743
I think you'll have to play
his game a little longer.

No.

-That's your ego talking.
-Fuck you.

Oh, and now it's shouting.

510
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.351
You wanna go over like you did
with me, full-on attack mode?


511
00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:31.952
I'm a coward, Ben,
that's why it worked.


512
00:26:31.986 --> 00:26:33.654
But this guy,

513
00:26:33.687 --> 00:26:35.556
I think you'll have to go under
to even get through.


514
00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:38.058
But the question is,
are you the man to do that?


515
00:26:39.093 --> 00:26:40.795
We're not talking about me.

516

We're talking about the feed.

517
00:26:43.297 --> 00:26:45.065
It won't help you
to keep thinking of him


518
00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:47.401
as a killer or evil incarnate.

519
00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:49.503
He's a showman.

520
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.973
And that's not a job title,
it's a psychological need.

524

there's not much more
I can tell you.


525
00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:03.651
You're looking good, Ben.

526
00:27:04.118 --> 00:27:05.853
Actually, why did I say that?

527
00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:07.922
That's a total lie.
You're looking haunted.


528
00:27:07.955 --> 00:27:09.557
You know when I killed one
it wasn't enough.

Two, yeah, kinda maybe,
but still not enough.

No number was enough,
would ever be enough.

Some things
just can't be satiated,

but you know that.

Me killing, you saving,
it's the same problem, right?

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.534
Never enough
to scratch that itch


535
00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:21.735

Arrived here a year ago.

Last night,
the night she was taken,


543
00:27:36.684 --> 00:27:38.052
that was her first day working

544
00:27:38.085 --> 00:27:39.386
at the Campbell's Landing
jewelry store.


545
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.121
We spoke with her boss there

546
00:27:41.155 --> 00:27:42.690
and the last person to see her
before the abduction,


547
00:27:42.723 --> 00:27:44.391
a colleague, Sofia Romana.

548
00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:46.861
They went for a few
first-day celebration drinks.


549
00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:48.162
Where?

550
00:27:48.195 --> 00:27:50.130
Little joint
on 21st and Bay Tree.


551
00:27:50.164 --> 00:27:52.633
All right, pull security footage
from the bar in the local area.


552
00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:53.701
What about the mother?

553
00:27:54.134 --> 00:27:55.569
Thought you and me
could handle that.


554
00:27:56.837 --> 00:27:57.938
