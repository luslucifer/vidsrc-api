1
00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.258
I am centered and focused.

2
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:38.098
Nothing can take away my shine.

3
00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.718
Right.

4
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:45.897
I hope you can see it.

5
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.291
I put blue tape
where I want it.


6
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.694
Glad you're
not particular.


7
00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:54.174
Come on,
I'm not that particular.


8
00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:56.658
Oh, please.
You're a designer.


9
00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.271
So are you,
as of today.


10
00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:00.797
That is correct.

11
00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:03.759
Perfect.

12
00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:04.935
Thanks, guys.

13
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.894
Come here.

14
00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:14.782
So now,
when you're creating...


15
00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:16.786
that's what you'll see.

16
00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.138
You're kidding me!

17
00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:21.622
I can see
the Astoria Tower.


18
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.408
Our first project
together.


19
00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:24.715
That, right there,

20
00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.545
is why I left Baluster Bay
to join you.


21
00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.026
Oh, really?

22
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.115
'Cause I thought it was
because our boss closed shop


23
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.030
so he could retire.

24
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:33.341
So there was that, too,

25
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:36.043
and the promotion,

26
00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:37.480
but mostly,

27
00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:39.484
it was your vision.

28
00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.011
Yeah, I just hope
it pans out, though,


29
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:43.754
because, so far,

30
00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:45.322
that good old meditation app
you recommended


31
00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.239
is not helping my nerves.

32
00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.243
You just have to give it
a little bit more time,


33
00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:50.899
and stop worrying.

34
00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:52.816
It is going to be amazing.

35
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.735
Julia Galvins Design
is going to be huge.


36
00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:57.608
What if it isn't?

37
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:58.871
I mean...

38
00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:00.309
what if-- what if
you came here for nothing?


39
00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.659
I'm just...

40
00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:03.185
Really great at what you do,
and everyone knows it,


41
00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.189
and that's why
you didn't take another job,


42
00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:07.760
and why I decided
to take this one with you.


43
00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:09.851
It's day one.

44
00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:11.244
You've already landed a pitch.

45
00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:12.465
You're right.

46
00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:13.641
I just need to stay focused,

47
00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:15.776
and everything
will to be fine, right?


48
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:18.782
Right.

49
00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:22.920
So...

50
00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.578
does this mean
we're open for business?


51
00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.497
Almost.

52
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.544
I just need to pick out
my belated birthday present


53
00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:31.852
to myself,

54
00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:33.638
and then our office
will be complete.


55
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.186
You're clearly
in denial.


56
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.886
We need more space.
Even our wall knows it.


57
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.890
We don't need more space.

58
00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:52.546
We just...

59
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.724
may have to consider
a collage of all our graduates.


60
00:02:57.164 --> 00:02:59.516
How's a collage going
to get us more storage?


61
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.911
More yard space?
Another room?


62
00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.915
If we think big...

63
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.874
You're starting
to sound like Bridget.


64
00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:06.923
Hey!

65
00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:07.925
Hey!

66
00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.058
Who's your best friend?

67
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.452
You know you are.

68
00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:11.498
That's right,

69
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:12.892
so don't you dare compare me

70
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:14.330
to the girl
who broke your heart.


71
00:03:14.373 --> 00:03:16.203
She's the one who insisted
we needed to franchise.


72
00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:17.771
I'm just saying
that we could...


73
00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.778
You're messing with me,
aren't you?


74
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.520
13 years, and I can still
pull one over on you.


75
00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:24.045
Only because you studied
Behavioral Science,


76
00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.614
and you know my patterns now.

77
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:26.964
Which is why I think
we should focus


78
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.097
on what really matters.

79
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.448
A new filing system?

80
00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:30.363
No.

81
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.373
Working with these guys.

82
00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:37.638
Mm?

83
00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:40.078
Hey, what up?

84
00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:41.646
: Welcome

85
00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.478
to Love at First Bark's
annual adoption fair.


86
00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:10.096
I don't know
how I'm supposed to choose one.


87
00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.620
They're all so adorable.

88
00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:13.624
Well, let's start
with the size.


89
00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:15.933
What kind of dog
are you looking for?


90
00:04:15.977 --> 00:04:18.678
Uh, I work from home,
so an office dog.


91
00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:21.118
Right, something
with a more mild temperament.


92
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.556
Do you have
any experience with dogs?


93
00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.082
Actual experience?
Uh, no.


94
00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:27.305
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl,


95
00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:29.135
so does that count?

96
00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:30.876
It depends
on why you didn't get one.


97
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.534
Oh, my parents were surgeons
in the military,


98
00:04:33.578 --> 00:04:35.974
so we were always on the move.

99
00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.761
Wasn't really
the best setup for a dog.


100
00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:39.372
Well, it sounds like you
have the perfect setup now.


101
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:40.418
Yeah.

102
00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.082
Oh!

103
00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:49.872
Hi!

104
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.397
King?

105
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:52.791
Oh, wow.

106
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.969
That's a very regal name.

107
00:04:55.012 --> 00:04:56.886
He's been with us
for a while.


108
00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.629
He's sweet, but strong-willed.

109
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:00.895
Just hasn't really
connected with anyone yet.


110
00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:02.202
It looks
like he likes you, though.


111
00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:04.856
Yeah, looks
like it.


112
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.814
Well, my name
is Julia.


113
00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:07.815
No royal connection,

114
00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:11.123
but people say I'm pretty nice,
so there's that.


115
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.124
You know, they say

116
00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.560
a dog chooses his owner.

117
00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:14.648
I think King just chose you.

118
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:16.649
Did you just choose me?

119
00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:18.129
Oh, I think that's a yes.

120
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.610
: Heel... heel!

121
00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:24.046
Good girl.

122
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.613
Don't worry, King.

123
00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:26.832
I won't make you
walk like that.


124
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.138
Oh, you have a question
about walking?


125
00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:30.836
No, no, no.
I was just telling King...


126
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:31.880
Owen!

127
00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:32.837
We've got a question
over here.


128
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.708
Heel.

129
00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:35.622
No, no, I...

130
00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:41.975
Sorry, I, I...
I didn't.


131
00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:44.021
I don't have any questions,
but thank you...


132
00:05:45.153 --> 00:05:46.284
Owen.

133
00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:47.764
: Owen is
our amazing dog trainer,


134
00:05:47.807 --> 00:05:49.244
and Julia here
is looking to adopt.


135
00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:50.679
Am I right?

136
00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:53.247
Yes, if King will have me.

137
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.249
Wow, congratulations
to you both,


138
00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:56.163
and if you do have
a question...


139
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.907
Wow, you train rescue
and therapy dogs?


140
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:04.605
Well, sometimes,
they're the same thing.


141
00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:06.476
Owen gives
complimentary training sessions


142
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.216
for first-time adoptees,

143
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.131
just to help them
with the transition.


144
00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:11.350
That's sweet, thanks,

145
00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:12.742
but I don't think
we're going to need it.


146
00:06:12.786 --> 00:06:13.787
Well, if you do...

147
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.005
I have to be honest...

148
00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:16.397
I've read a few of the books,

149
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.574
and they all just seem
a little too rigid for me.


150
00:06:19.618 --> 00:06:20.880
I already decided
I'm going to go


151
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.056
with a "love is all you need"
approach.


152
00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.536
That's not a technique...

153
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.929
and it's not.

154
00:06:27.973 --> 00:06:29.235
I'm sorry?

155
00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.280
It's not
all you need.


156
00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.237
You need to set
boundaries,


157
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.977
establish guidelines.

158
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.413
Yeah, but...

159
00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:35.458
there's also a lot more
to relationships


160
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:36.328
than just giving orders,

161
00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:37.199
so...

162
00:06:40.114 --> 00:06:41.941
You're right.

163
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:42.812
You need to set a schedule.

164
00:06:44.161 --> 00:06:45.641
You know what?
Right now,


165
00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:47.686
I think I really just want
to buy him a really cute bed.


166
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.384
Great.

167
00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:51.863
We don't have to agree
on everything now,


168
00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:53.474
but we do like to go
the extra mile


169
00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:55.084
to make sure you're both happy
in your new home together,


170
00:06:55.127 --> 00:06:57.869
so we'll follow up
with a home visit in a few days.


171
00:06:57.913 --> 00:06:58.695
Great.

172
00:06:58.739 --> 00:06:59.696
Good.

173
00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:06.529
Okay!

174
00:07:06.573 --> 00:07:07.660
Come in.

175
00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:09.139
What're you doing, King?
Come on.


176
00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:10.706
Just a few more steps, buddy.

177
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.231
You a little nervous?
It's okay. You're home now.


178
00:07:13.274 --> 00:07:15.102
Come on.

179
00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:16.407
Okay, just...
come on.


180
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.322
Just a few more steps.
Yeah, there we go. Okay.


181
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.541
Okay.

182
00:07:22.413 --> 00:07:23.240
All right, buddy.

183
00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:26.285
Look...

184
00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:28.287
I know change is tough,
all right?


185
00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:29.897
I can relate,
but we're home now, okay?


186
00:07:31.725 --> 00:07:33.378
Ooh, ooh!
Hold that thought.


187
00:07:33.422 --> 00:07:34.727
Okay.

188
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:40.646
Hello?

189
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.995
Yes, hi, Mr. Salas.

190
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:44.519
It's so great
to hear from you, yeah.


191
00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:46.477
We'll just make it

192
00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:49.263
Okay, wonderful.
See you tomorrow.


193
00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:51.133
Okay.

194
00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:54.092
All right,
sorry about that, buddy.


195
00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:55.964
Um...

196
00:07:56.007 --> 00:07:57.052
So, do you want a tour?

197
00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:59.445
It's kind of
a short one, but, um...


198
00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:00.794
come on, follow me.

199
00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:03.275
Uh, this is my new office.

200
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.931
Or I can just follow you.

201
00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:09.932
That works, too.

202
00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:21.247
Ah, here we go.

203
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.902
I got this nice new bed.

204
00:08:26.077 --> 00:08:26.947
It's Velveteen.

205
00:08:30.647 --> 00:08:32.996
You can sleep here tonight,
if you want.


206
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.824
I've got to go to work.
Enjoy your new bed.


207
00:08:35.868 --> 00:08:36.826
Right...

208
00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:54.711
I know it's late, King.

209
00:08:54.755 --> 00:08:56.800
But I've got a big pitch
tomorrow.


210
00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:02.501
You want to come up here?

211
00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:06.418
No?

212
00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:09.333
It's goose down.

213
00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:12.161
You more of a duck fan?

214
00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:17.775
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

215
00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:22.040
Okay.

216
00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:34.442
Are you sure
you do not mind taking him?


217
00:09:34.485 --> 00:09:36.095
I just don't want
to leave him alone.


218
00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:37.227
Are you kidding me?

219
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.620
The fastest way
to get help anywhere


220
00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:40.099
is to bring a really cute dog.

221
00:09:40.143 --> 00:09:41.535
I'll get us our
swatches in no time.


222
00:09:41.578 --> 00:09:44.755
Okay, and I will call you
the second that I'm done.


223
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.453
Don't worry about us.

224
00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:48.542
Just worry about
Wyatt Salas.


225
00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:49.673
Please,
I'm not worried.


226
00:09:49.717 --> 00:09:51.457
I'm...

227
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.675
confident and shining

228
00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.809
and something else
very spiritual.


229
00:09:55.852 --> 00:09:57.854
"Perfect
just the way you are?"


230
00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.638
Yeah,
that sounds vaguely familiar.


231
00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:01.074
Good...

232
00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:02.902
'cause today could kind of
be a game changer.


233
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:05.211
We're just pitching
one restaurant.


234
00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:06.475
Yeah, but Wyatt Salas
owns 20,


235
00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:07.390
so you know what that means.

236
00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:10.527
Are you trying
to make me feel better or worse?


237
00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:12.489
Right.

238
00:10:12.532 --> 00:10:13.404
You're going to kill it.

239
00:10:14.493 --> 00:10:15.887
So go.

240
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.282
Okay.

241
00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:18.240
All right, King,
wish me luck.


242
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:20.114
Oh!

243
00:10:21.072 --> 00:10:22.685
Aw...

244
00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:23.949
I'll take that
as good luck.


245
00:10:23.992 --> 00:10:24.907
All right.

246
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:26.127
'Kay.

247
00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:31.748
You're right,

248
00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:33.535
the restaurant business
is brutal.


249
00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.583
That's why I usually work
with established firms


250
00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:36.716
on my buildings,

251
00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:38.241
especially on something

252
00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:40.159
as crucial
as a restaurant relaunch.


253
00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:43.295
Yes, and I appreciate
you giving us a shot.


254
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.821
Well, you were always
one of my favorites


255
00:10:44.864 --> 00:10:45.824
at Baluster Bay...

256
00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.353
but honestly,

257
00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:50.965
you think you can handle
this project on your own?


258
00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:52.578
Oh, it's not just me.

259
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.931
There's also my junior designer,
Sherry McRay,


260
00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:58.286
and if I was your favorite,
you will be in great hands.


261
00:10:58.329 --> 00:10:59.811
One of my favorites.

262
00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.380
Right.

263
00:11:03.602 --> 00:11:07.349
Well, I realize we may not be
what you're used to scale wise,


264
00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:09.485
but we will give you
everything we've got.


265
00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.533
Well, you've got two people.

266
00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:12.884
Two very talented people

267
00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:15.542
with no one else to focus on...
yet.


268
00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:18.069
We can handle it.

269
00:11:25.302 --> 00:11:28.004
"Two very talented people."

270
00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:29.616
Ugh.

271
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.880
That didn't sound desperate
at all.


272
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:33.756
You know what?
No.


273
00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:35.848
I'm not going to doom us.

274
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:38.201
It started off good,
and then...


275
00:11:38.244 --> 00:11:39.595
I should've just said
you were a new hire.


276
00:11:39.638 --> 00:11:40.772
It would've made us
sound bigger.


277
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.125
You hungry?

278
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.574
Oh, okay.

279
00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:50.837
Do you want a treat?

280
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:52.319
All right.

281
00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:55.152
We've got salmon...

282
00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:56.676
or peanut butter.

283
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.636
You pick.

284
00:11:59.248 --> 00:12:01.775
Okay, peanut butter it is.

285
00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:05.304
All right.

286
00:12:05.348 --> 00:12:06.524
Here you go, King.

287
00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:10.489
Really?

288
00:12:11.971 --> 00:12:13.714
Whatever you do,
please look happy.


289
00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:14.673
Please, please.

290
00:12:20.337 --> 00:12:21.384
Hi! Sorry.

291
00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:22.734
You're not Molly.

292
00:12:22.778 --> 00:12:24.652
No. Why, did they tell you
that she was coming?


293
00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:27.005
Uh...
they didn't say she wasn't,


294
00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:29.576
so I guess
I just kind of assumed.


295
00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:30.709
Sorry,
Stuck with me.


296
00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:33.366
Can I come in?

297
00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:36.199
Yes.

298
00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:37.725
Yes, come on in.

299
00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:46.091
Hey, buddy!

300
00:12:46.134 --> 00:12:47.223
How are you, King?

301
00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:51.538
So, how's it going?

302
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.932
Oh, you know.

303
00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:54.544
Work's been kind of crazy,

304
00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:57.115
but that's to be expected
with a new business, so...


305
00:12:58.161 --> 00:12:59.076
I meant with King.

306
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:02.867
Right. Of course.

307
00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:04.087
Uh...

308
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.701
It's going well...
I mean, pretty well.


309
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:07.747
Pretty well?

310
00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:09.142
Yeah, yeah.
Well enough.


311
00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:11.147
We're just kind of warming up
to each other.


312
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.977
So what's your routine?

313
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.371
I'm sorry?

314
00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:15.634
When do you get up?

315
00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:18.205
Eat? Walk? Play?

316
00:13:18.249 --> 00:13:20.123
It's all just
kind of in there.


317
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:21.125
In where?

318
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:22.476
Are you always
this inquisitive?


319
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.567
I'm just trying
to get the full picture here.


320
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.182
Which I appreciate,

321
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.535
but I'm not going to force
all this structure on him.


322
00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:31.234
Like I said, I'm going
with an all love approach.


323
00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.716
Is it working?

324
00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:33.718
Mostly.

325
00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:36.464
Well,
you do look pretty happy.


326
00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:37.683
Told you.

327
00:13:38.642 --> 00:13:39.906
You're good?

328
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.388
You don't need any help?

329
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:42.607
You mean with training?

330
00:13:42.651 --> 00:13:44.046
No. Mm-mm.

331
00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.178
You feel in control?

332
00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:46.355
Totally.

333
00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.881
Okay.

334
00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:49.187
Great.

335
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:51.890
All right.
I'll just head...


336
00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:55.549
Uh, sorry.
Can I, um...


337
00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.210
Can I just give you
a quick tip?


338
00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:00.517
Oh, is this
my free lesson?


339
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.737
Make him sit for it.

340
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.044
What?

341
00:14:03.088 --> 00:14:04.830
The treat.

342
00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:06.356
King's a pleaser,
but he's also spirited.


343
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.837
He needs to feel
like he's earned it.


344
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:08.927
That's the only way
he's going to know


345
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:09.799
the order of things
in his new home.


346
00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:11.542
Just try this.

347
00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:12.457
Sit.

348
00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:16.422
Good boy.

349
00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:20.605
Have a nice night.

350
00:14:27.229 --> 00:14:28.535
Work for treats?

351
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.669
You don't need
to work for treats.


352
00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:34.419
Do you?

353
00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:36.466
Okay, but just for fun.

354
00:14:38.776 --> 00:14:39.691
Sit.

355
00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:43.177
What am I doing wrong?

356
00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:46.533
Sit?

357
00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:50.019
Do you want the salmon?
Okay.


358
00:15:01.348 --> 00:15:02.524
Hey, why are you so worried?

359
00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.006
You said that
the meeting went great.


360
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.429
I didn't say great.

361
00:15:05.473 --> 00:15:06.594
I said good,

362
00:15:06.637 --> 00:15:07.716
and I don't even know
how good it went


363
00:15:07.758 --> 00:15:08.535
considering he hasn't
called me yet.


364
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.252
But maybe that's because
you're strangling your phone.


365
00:15:13.624 --> 00:15:14.573
You're right.

366
00:15:15.953 --> 00:15:17.074
I'm going to call him.

367
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.929
Good.

368
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:22.077
: Hello?

369
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.889
Hello, Mr. Salas?
It's Julia Galvins calling.


370
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:25.829
I was just about
to call you.


371
00:15:25.873 --> 00:15:27.123
I was sensing that.

372
00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:29.883
Uh, see?
We're already in sync.


373
00:15:29.927 --> 00:15:31.091
I really enjoyed
your pitch...


374
00:15:31.134 --> 00:15:32.557
That is great to hear

375
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.929
because I've been thinking
about your space, nonstop.


376
00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:38.121
But I'm going to have to go
in another direction.


377
00:15:38.163 --> 00:15:39.113
Oh.

378
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.382
I actually feel

379
00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:44.503
I was prepared
to lead this project,


380
00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:46.703
but thank you
for letting us know.


381
00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:49.679
Bye.

382
00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:56.795
I'm sorry
I couldn't close the deal.


383
00:15:58.693 --> 00:15:59.598
You know what?

384
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.358
I think
it's actually good luck


385
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:04.731
not to book your first pitch.

386
00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:07.577
Really?

387
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.647
I still get benefits, right?

388
00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:14.304
I don't know
what I was thinking, King.


389
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.512
I can't compete.

390
00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:16.849
I mean, I get it.

391
00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:17.884
I'd probably hire
a more established company, too.


392
00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:19.264
I just...

393
00:16:19.307 --> 00:16:20.903
just thought,
with our history, you know,


394
00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:21.895
but...

395
00:16:22.973 --> 00:16:23.879
Come on, King.

396
00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:25.518
Throw me a bone.

397
00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:27.157
Bad pun. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.


398
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.183
Okay, please.

399
00:16:29.227 --> 00:16:30.219
If I don't make it
to the dry cleaners


400
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:31.253
in the next 10 minutes,

401
00:16:31.297 --> 00:16:32.892
I'm going to have
nothing to wear,


402
00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:33.798
and I'm pretty sure that's not
going to help my cause, so...


403
00:16:33.842 --> 00:16:34.790
come on.

404
00:16:34.834 --> 00:16:36.084
Please?

405
00:16:36.127 --> 00:16:36.946
Who's walking who?

406
00:16:38.154 --> 00:16:39.362
Thank you, sir.

407
00:16:39.405 --> 00:16:41.561
That's very helpful.
I feel much better now.


408
00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:44.020
Can I give your dog
a treat?


409
00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:46.909
Yeah, it's real hit or miss,
but sure.


410
00:16:46.952 --> 00:16:47.944
Yeah, you can try.

411
00:16:47.987 --> 00:16:48.893
Sit.

412
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.524
Stay.

413
00:16:53.206 --> 00:16:54.241
Now shake.

414
00:16:54.284 --> 00:16:55.147
Oh, no, he doesn't shake...

415
00:16:57.993 --> 00:16:59.244
Good boy!

416
00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:05.885
Seriously?

417
00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:10.758
Up!

418
00:17:10.802 --> 00:17:12.139
I'm just curious

419
00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:14.080
how much your commercial space
runs for, roughly?


420
00:17:14.123 --> 00:17:15.244
I'm thinking
for the right price,


421
00:17:15.287 --> 00:17:16.840
my partner might actually
consider moving.


422
00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:20.463
I'm sorry, it's how much?

423
00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.102
Um, yeah, uh...

424
00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:23.826
okay, Mom!
All right.


425
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.293
Bye.

426
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:26.156
Hi.

427
00:17:26.198 --> 00:17:27.492
Hey!

428
00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:29.907
Maybe just one session
couldn't hurt,


429
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:31.761
but...

430
00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:33.703
I still want
to lead with love.


431
00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:36.981
Uh, yeah.

432
00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:38.231
I'll try to work that
into the schedule.


433
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.242
'Kay.

434
00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:50.954
So, are you looking
for an express package,


435
00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:51.816
or something more in-depth?

436
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.455
Uh...

437
00:17:53.498 --> 00:17:55.008
I'm not really sure.

438
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.690
I think she's just looking
for a few tips.


439
00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:57.811
Am I right?

440
00:17:57.854 --> 00:17:58.846
That would be great, yes.

441
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.701
Well, he only has
about 30 minutes


442
00:18:00.744 --> 00:18:02.080
before our lunch meeting...

443
00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:03.072
Perfect.

444
00:18:05.531 --> 00:18:06.911
Yeah, sure.

445
00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:08.076
We can do a quick assessment,
see where you're at,


446
00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:09.757
and we'll go
from there.


447
00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:11.138
Where I'm at,
like, mentally?


448
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.553
'Cause this is probably
not the best week to ask.


449
00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:15.105
No, I, um...

450
00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:16.011
meant with the dog.

451
00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:17.823
Just simple commands.

452
00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:20.885
Sit, stay... come.

453
00:18:20.927 --> 00:18:22.524
Yes.

454
00:18:24.033 --> 00:18:25.628
Yes, you're comfortable
with them?


455
00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:27.957
Comfy-ish.

456
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.510
Great.
Let's see them.


457
00:18:29.553 --> 00:18:30.632
Okay.

458
00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:34.039
So...

459
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.229
Right. So...

460
00:18:37.273 --> 00:18:38.179
Sit.

461
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:41.284
Sit?

462
00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:45.511
Sit!

463
00:18:50.557 --> 00:18:51.677
Okay, let's keep going.

464
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:53.360
Right.
Here goes...


465
00:18:54.998 --> 00:18:55.990
Stay.

466
00:19:00.174 --> 00:19:01.209
You actually have to walk away.

467
00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:03.667
Why?

468
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.831
Well, it's the only way
to gauge


469
00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:06.384
if the dog's
actually listening to you,


470
00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:09.576
or if he's just staying put
because that's where he is.


471
00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:11.085
Simple, one-word phrases.

472
00:19:11.129 --> 00:19:12.896
I'll try.

473
00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:13.888
That was two words.

474
00:19:17.295 --> 00:19:18.331
Stay.

475
00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:21.435
Stay...

476
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.223
You have to go
where he can't see you,


477
00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.595
just where he hears your voice.

478
00:19:28.638 --> 00:19:30.493
Well, that sounds
like a trick, but...


479
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:31.398
I'll do it.

480
00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:34.029
Stay.

481
00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:41.490
Okay, come!

482
00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:43.302
Hi!

483
00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:45.587
Yeah, nice try.

484
00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:47.959
Doesn't count, does it?

485
00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:49.728
Not so much.

486
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:51.065
Don't worry about it.

487
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.264
We can work on this
more in-depth on Saturday.


488
00:19:53.307 --> 00:19:55.248
Until then, just keep
the commands simple.


489
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.534
Sit. Stay. Come.

490
00:19:57.576 --> 00:19:58.698
Easy. Done.

491
00:19:58.742 --> 00:19:59.906
Are those
your simple commands?


492
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.157
I'm here all night.

493
00:20:02.752 --> 00:20:03.797
All right, well,

494
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.841
until Saturday...

495
00:20:04.885 --> 00:20:06.495
and remember,

496
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.452
you're the alpha.

497
00:20:07.496 --> 00:20:08.715
Right.

498
00:20:13.721 --> 00:20:15.766
Maybe I'll take a quick peek
at the express package.


499
00:20:17.463 --> 00:20:18.726
Sure.

500
00:20:24.297 --> 00:20:25.995
I might still be
in my sweats,


501
00:20:26.038 --> 00:20:28.040
but I'm going
to turn this ship around.


502
00:20:28.084 --> 00:20:29.389
Who's next?

503
00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:30.390
Atta girl.

504
00:20:30.434 --> 00:20:31.609
Just make sure

505
00:20:31.653 --> 00:20:32.392
that there's something
left for me to do


506
00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:33.393
when I get back.

507
00:20:33.437 --> 00:20:34.568
Oh, hey, remember,

508
00:20:34.612 --> 00:20:35.395
all we need to do
is fill the sample book,


509
00:20:35.439 --> 00:20:36.397
not overload it.

510
00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:38.008
Whatever gets us business.

511
00:20:40.314 --> 00:20:41.185
Right.

512
00:20:42.882 --> 00:20:43.927
Okay.

513
00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:47.931
Breathe in.

514
00:20:47.974 --> 00:20:49.542
Breathe out.

515
00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:54.765
Something
about a river and a wave.


516
00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:57.855
It only takes one,
right, King?


517
00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:07.387
You've reached 555-2825.

518
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.431
Please leave a message.

519
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:09.998
Hi. This is Julia Galvins.

520
00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:11.347
Uh, we met last year.

521
00:21:11.391 --> 00:21:12.479
I was on the design team

522
00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.176
for the Margowsky Library
renovations.


523
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.265
What?

524
00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:16.397
We just went out.

525
00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:18.878
I...

526
00:21:21.707 --> 00:21:23.186
I was calling
to let you know


527
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.884
that I started
my own design studio,


528
00:21:24.927 --> 00:21:26.102
Julia Galvins Designs,

529
00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:27.016
so if you need anything,
please...


530
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.017
What?

531
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.106
Sit. Sit!

532
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.238
Shh!

533
00:21:31.587 --> 00:21:32.893
Better yet,
why don't I just call you back?


534
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:38.507
Okay, that barking right there
was not okay.


535
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:42.338
What's up, King, huh?

536
00:21:42.381 --> 00:21:44.209
Do you want to shake?

537
00:21:44.253 --> 00:21:45.863
No?
What's going on?


538
00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:49.127
You want to go outside?

539
00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:50.781
All right, fine.
Grab your keys.


540
00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:52.087
Let's go.

541
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.833
This what you needed, boy?
Huh?


542
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.841
Okay, King.

543
00:22:05.884 --> 00:22:08.714
You can run now, play.

544
00:22:08.758 --> 00:22:11.456
You can show off
that new fancy collar.


545
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:25.732
Aren't you adorable?

546
00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:28.082
Hi!

547
00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:29.127
I hope
she's not bothering you.


548
00:22:30.476 --> 00:22:31.782
No, no, not at all.
She's a charmer.


549
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:34.916
King's just a little shy.

550
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.875
I don't know.
It might be his new collar.


551
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.573
Do you think it looks
too much like a necklace?


552
00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:40.530
I think it's perfect.

553
00:22:40.574 --> 00:22:42.141
- Yeah.
- And don't worry.


554
00:22:42.184 --> 00:22:43.577
Ginger's
a social butterfly.


555
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.579
She'll make him her new
best friend in minutes.


556
00:22:47.756 --> 00:22:48.801
Oop!
There they go.


557
00:22:48.844 --> 00:22:50.498
Yeah.

558
00:22:50.541 --> 00:22:52.587
I hope I look that good
in my third trimester.


559
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.502
You're expecting puppies?

560
00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:56.721
Sorry, she's expecting puppies?

561
00:22:56.765 --> 00:22:59.289
You're clearly expecting
babies, or a baby.


562
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:00.988
One baby.

563
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:03.077
Ginger's actually due
in four weeks,


564
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.947
and I have three months to go.

565
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:06.254
But I work from home,

566
00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:08.778
so I can just, you know,
relax into it.


567
00:23:08.822 --> 00:23:11.476
And wear sweat pants
all day.


568
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.826
Sweats?

569
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:14.306
Sorry, or not.

570
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.568
I, uh,

571
00:23:15.612 --> 00:23:17.048
I just recently started
working from home,


572
00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:19.268
so it feels
like a perk to me.


573
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:20.747
What do you do from home?

574
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:22.140
I'm an interior designer.

575
00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:23.968
I actually used to work
for Baluster Bay,


576
00:23:24.012 --> 00:23:25.796
but I recently just started
my own design studio,


577
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.104
and yeah, it's been fun,

578
00:23:28.147 --> 00:23:29.845
but I'm clearly projecting
my own personal style


579
00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:31.411
onto my dog.

580
00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:33.109
I'm Julia Galvins.

581
00:23:33.152 --> 00:23:34.719
Oh, Cassie Guggenheim.

582
00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:35.807
So nice to meet you.

583
00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:36.634
Nice to meet you
as well.


584
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.988
This may be
a little bit small scale,


585
00:23:42.032 --> 00:23:44.164
but my husband and I are
actually looking for a designer


586
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.557
for the nursery.

587
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.385
Oh, my gosh!
I love nurseries.


588
00:23:47.428 --> 00:23:48.865
You do?

589
00:23:48.908 --> 00:23:50.431
Yes, yes, I love babies.
I'm definitely a baby person.


590
00:23:50.475 --> 00:23:51.650
In fact,
a lot of my best friends are...


591
00:23:52.913 --> 00:23:54.175
babies?

592
00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:55.698
Why don't I send you
some photos of the space,


593
00:23:55.742 --> 00:23:56.612
and we'll just go from there?

594
00:23:56.656 --> 00:23:58.440
Sound good?

595
00:23:58.484 --> 00:24:01.052
It sounds like I should go
to the dog park more often.


596
00:24:01.095 --> 00:24:02.531
Here's my card.

597
00:24:02.575 --> 00:24:04.011
Perfect.

598
00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:06.101
I'll call your office,
and I'll set up a time.


599
00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.146
Great!

600
00:24:07.189 --> 00:24:08.930
Great.

601
00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:10.889
Okay, sweetie,
let's go get you some treats.


602
00:24:10.932 --> 00:24:11.890
Time to get pampered.

603
00:24:13.717 --> 00:24:14.544
It was nice to meet you.
I hope to hear from you.


604
00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:15.589
You bet.

605
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.773
Was this all
part of your master plan?


606
00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:27.994
If it was, thanks.

607
00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:38.222
Any ideas for a nursery, King?

608
00:24:40.529 --> 00:24:42.574
What about, like,
a magical forest,


609
00:24:42.618 --> 00:24:43.619
or...

610
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.275
What's up?

611
00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.407
You sleepy?

612
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:50.540
Do you want to come up here?

613
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:53.238
Still no?

614
00:24:53.282 --> 00:24:55.371
Okay.

615
00:24:55.414 --> 00:24:56.589
Just close your eyes, buddy.

616
00:24:58.418 --> 00:25:00.377
Do you want me
to close my eyes first?


617
00:25:01.856 --> 00:25:02.814
Okay.

618
00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:05.942
How's that?

619
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.947
Don't worry.

620
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.198
We're going to figure this out.

621
00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:18.757
I promise.

622
00:25:28.454 --> 00:25:29.752
I know it's only
a four-week course,


623
00:25:29.796 --> 00:25:31.657
but I thought we'd be
a little bit more hands on,


624
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:32.783
down and dirty.

625
00:25:32.827 --> 00:25:33.952
That's why I wore this.

626
00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.381
Well, every owner and dog
is different,


627
00:25:35.424 --> 00:25:37.199
so every session
will be different.


628
00:25:37.243 --> 00:25:39.450
I just don't understand
how shopping's going to help.


629
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:40.490
He won't sleep.

630
00:25:40.532 --> 00:25:41.918
I mean he slept
a little, but...


631
00:25:41.962 --> 00:25:43.736
it's like
he just can't relax.


632
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.819
That's why we're here.

633
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:46.897
But I already
bought him a bed.


634
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:49.061
So much of this is
about how you feel.


635
00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:50.880
Well, I feel
pretty ready to work.


636
00:25:50.923 --> 00:25:53.001
Great. Well...

637
00:25:53.044 --> 00:25:54.257
let's start by putting this...

638
00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:57.244
in your basket.

639
00:25:58.803 --> 00:26:00.231
You want me
to buy a fanny pack?


640
00:26:00.274 --> 00:26:01.703
That's a treat trainer.

641
00:26:03.088 --> 00:26:04.516
It's a fanny pack.

642
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.465
I will put it back
in the basket,


643
00:26:06.508 --> 00:26:08.067
but I'm not convinced.

644
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.669
Okay.
Let's pick a toy.


645
00:26:11.573 --> 00:26:12.656
Which one?

646
00:26:12.699 --> 00:26:13.522
Well, which one
do you think he'd like?


647
00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:14.864
I don't even know

648
00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:16.336
what kind of treats
he likes best yet.


649
00:26:16.379 --> 00:26:17.505
I think you're putting
a bit too much pressure on this.


650
00:26:17.548 --> 00:26:20.275
Just pick any toy.

651
00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:23.220
Okay...

652
00:26:23.262 --> 00:26:24.865
this one looks fun.

653
00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:26.597
All right.
Classic choice...


654
00:26:26.639 --> 00:26:27.549
and I'll pick this one.

655
00:26:28.675 --> 00:26:30.103
Now, why don't you jog

656
00:26:30.146 --> 00:26:30.926
all the way down
to the end of the aisle.


657
00:26:32.831 --> 00:26:34.042
Sit.

658
00:26:34.086 --> 00:26:35.601
Stay.

659
00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:36.856
All right.

660
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.502
Now...

661
00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:39.194
put your toy up in the air...

662
00:26:39.238 --> 00:26:40.190
Okay.

663
00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:41.229
And shake.

664
00:26:46.035 --> 00:26:47.636
Ah!

665
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.195
He likes the squirrel!

666
00:26:49.238 --> 00:26:50.320
Let's trade.

667
00:26:53.828 --> 00:26:55.906
Good boy. Sit.

668
00:26:55.948 --> 00:26:57.464
Sit!

669
00:26:57.507 --> 00:26:59.195
And stay.

670
00:26:59.239 --> 00:27:00.581
All right.

671
00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:01.836
Let's do it again.
Lift your toy in the air...


672
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.918
and shake!

673
00:27:07.422 --> 00:27:09.283
Okay, so...
now he likes the dragon?


674
00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.798
What's the constant here?

675
00:27:10.841 --> 00:27:12.443
He definitely wants a toy.

676
00:27:12.487 --> 00:27:15.344
He wants whatever
toy you have


677
00:27:15.387 --> 00:27:16.556
because you're the one
playing with him.


678
00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:17.985
Look, I know you want
to lead with love,


679
00:27:18.027 --> 00:27:19.673
but if you lead
with confidence,


680
00:27:19.717 --> 00:27:21.708
everything else is just
going to fall into place,


681
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:23.786
and he's going to choose you
every time.


682
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.769
All right, well,

683
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.328
then I'm going to get him
the squirrel and the dragon,


684
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.972
because if he loves me so much,
he deserves to be spoiled...


685
00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:33.223
but, uh...

686
00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:35.172
look, do I really need
to get this?


687
00:27:35.214 --> 00:27:36.904
Do you want to be
the alpha, or not?


688
00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:48.289
You checked
the wood samples?


689
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.718
'Cause I just want to make sure

690
00:27:49.761 --> 00:27:50.627
she understands the texture
that we're going for.


691
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:52.576
Done. Checked.

692
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:55.736
I am leading with confidence.

693
00:27:57.424 --> 00:27:58.983
Yeah, is that another gem
from the meditation app?


694
00:28:00.282 --> 00:28:01.666
Or your cute trainer?

695
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.398
What?
I don't have a cute trainer.


696
00:28:03.442 --> 00:28:04.567
Okay, sure, you don't.

697
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:05.563
King does.

698
00:28:05.607 --> 00:28:06.991
I saw his card.

699
00:28:09.157 --> 00:28:10.499
Okay, for starters,
he's not cute.


700
00:28:10.542 --> 00:28:11.841
He's just...

701
00:28:11.883 --> 00:28:13.356
in shape,

702
00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:14.957
and even if he was,
I wouldn't notice,


703
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:16.560
because what do I always say?

704
00:28:16.602 --> 00:28:17.771
Cookie batter is real food?

705
00:28:17.815 --> 00:28:19.633
And...

706
00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:22.188
career before love,
you're in the clear.


707
00:28:23.313 --> 00:28:25.608
Love before career,
you're just distracted.


708
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:28.508
I'm not really sure that
that is how that saying goes,


709
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:29.937
but I do like your focus.

710
00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:32.015
How do I look?

711
00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:33.833
Not at all intimidated
by Cassie.


712
00:28:35.608 --> 00:28:37.470
That's because
I'm ignoring the Internet,


713
00:28:37.513 --> 00:28:38.595
unlike you.

714
00:28:38.639 --> 00:28:39.937
Yeah, that doesn't
change the fact


715
00:28:39.981 --> 00:28:41.366
that she is
a major philanthropist


716
00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:42.924
who sits on the board
of practically every nonprofit


717
00:28:42.968 --> 00:28:44.007
in Portland.

718
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.869
She was lovely.

719
00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:48.423
Still, her connections
are kind of everything.


720
00:28:48.466 --> 00:28:50.284
Okay, you know what?

721
00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:51.670
I'm going to stop
asking you questions.


722
00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:53.921
All right, King.

723
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:57.298
Sit.

724
00:28:59.982 --> 00:29:00.978
Good boy.

725
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:02.319
See?

726
00:29:02.363 --> 00:29:04.355
Look at all that confidence.

727
00:29:04.397 --> 00:29:05.437
Beautiful.

728
00:29:06.562 --> 00:29:07.515
Hey, Julia?

729
00:29:07.558 --> 00:29:08.684
Yeah?

730
00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:10.892
I would take off
the fanny pack first.


731
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.040
Oh, my gosh.

732
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:34.746
So, are you ready to wow us?

733
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.132
Absolutely.

734
00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.689
Here we go.

735
00:29:37.733 --> 00:29:40.288
One of the most important things
to foster in a child


736
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.803
is imagination.

737
00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.404
That's why I want
to turn your nursery


738
00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:45.916
into a magical forest

739
00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.167
to engage
your child's sense of wonder.


740
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.638
Imagine your child
waking up,


741
00:29:49.682 --> 00:29:51.717
being surrounded by trees.

742
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.319
Three of the walls
will have delicate murals


743
00:29:53.361 --> 00:29:55.223
depicting a tranquil forest.

744
00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:56.738
I love that.

745
00:29:56.782 --> 00:29:58.297
Mm... and what about
the fourth wall?


746
00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.428
It'll be a bookcase

747
00:29:59.472 --> 00:30:00.996
for your child's
favorite books...


748
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.479
stories that will transport her
to fantastical places,


749
00:30:04.522 --> 00:30:07.264
and we'll use
various branches and textiles


750
00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.050
to bring it all together
in an organic way.


751
00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:11.574
Here, feel these,
for example.


752
00:30:16.188 --> 00:30:17.147
Oh, I don't know
about you,


753
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.322
but I really love this.

754
00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:20.019
: It does sound
pretty impressive.


755
00:30:20.063 --> 00:30:21.021
Oh, I'm so glad.

756
00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:22.240
I have to admit,

757
00:30:22.283 --> 00:30:24.155
'cause I was
just a little bit nervous...


758
00:30:24.198 --> 00:30:25.505
But I don't like to make
any decisions on the spot.


759
00:30:25.548 --> 00:30:26.462
Right, hon'?

760
00:30:26.506 --> 00:30:28.465
You don't.

761
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:30.032
He doesn't.

762
00:30:30.076 --> 00:30:31.860
Yeah, no, I...

763
00:30:31.904 --> 00:30:33.384
I totally understand.

764
00:30:33.428 --> 00:30:34.516
Um...

765
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.126
I mean,
it's a very big decision,


766
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.173
and I'm new,
we're new,


767
00:30:38.216 --> 00:30:39.827
so... so there's that.

768
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:40.872
Well, great.

769
00:30:40.916 --> 00:30:42.221
We'll look it
all over tonight,


770
00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:43.440
and get back to you,

771
00:30:43.483 --> 00:30:44.964
but it's all great.

772
00:30:45.008 --> 00:30:46.836
No rush.
No rush at all.


773
00:31:06.686 --> 00:31:07.905
Still nothing.

774
00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:10.256
Great.

775
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.649
Come on.

776
00:31:17.526 --> 00:31:19.050
Hi. This is Julia Galvins.

777
00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:20.835
I was calling to see
if you got my message.


778
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.142
If you need any design work,
please call us back,


779
00:31:23.185 --> 00:31:24.448
'cause we are here for you.

780
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.104
Anything from Cassie?

781
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.153
Not since you last asked

782
00:31:38.814 --> 00:31:39.989
I mean...
dogs can't talk,


783
00:31:40.032 --> 00:31:41.295
so you've got to be
pretty intuitive, right?


784
00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:42.340
As a trainer?

785
00:31:42.383 --> 00:31:44.124
I try to be, yeah.

786
00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:46.388
So then, do you think
it's a bad sign?


787
00:31:46.432 --> 00:31:47.346
Do I think
what's a bad sign?


788
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:50.132
Ah, make him sit
before we cross.


789
00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:51.830
Okay, King, sit.

790
00:31:51.873 --> 00:31:54.355
Good boy.

791
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.273
That she hasn't called.
It's been, like, 43 hours.


792
00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.970
Well, that depends.

793
00:32:00.014 --> 00:32:01.320
On what?

794
00:32:01.364 --> 00:32:02.626
If you're counting
the seconds.


795
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:04.716
Wait, are you trying
to be funny?


796
00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:05.804
That was a bad joke.

797
00:32:05.848 --> 00:32:07.110
No, no.

798
00:32:07.153 --> 00:32:08.155
Look, normally,
I would love them,


799
00:32:08.199 --> 00:32:09.374
but I'm just...

800
00:32:09.417 --> 00:32:10.679
I'm feeling
a little stressed right now.


801
00:32:10.723 --> 00:32:11.898
You know, it's not just me,
it's Sherry, too,


802
00:32:11.942 --> 00:32:13.727
and I don't...
I don't want to let her down.


803
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.859
I don't think you will.

804
00:32:14.902 --> 00:32:15.860
Okay.

805
00:32:18.864 --> 00:32:20.431
Um...

806
00:32:20.475 --> 00:32:22.694
let's, uh, let's head back.

807
00:32:22.738 --> 00:32:24.088
I thought we were walking
all the way to the park?


808
00:32:24.132 --> 00:32:25.655
No, I...
I don't think we need to.


809
00:32:25.698 --> 00:32:27.352
You're looking solid.

810
00:32:30.879 --> 00:32:31.923
Okay.

811
00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:33.883
Look, I just...

812
00:32:33.926 --> 00:32:34.927
I just think
she would've called by now


813
00:32:34.971 --> 00:32:36.408
if it was good news,
you know?


814
00:32:38.714 --> 00:32:40.979
You know what?
Hand me your phone.


815
00:32:41.022 --> 00:32:42.415
What?

816
00:32:42.458 --> 00:32:43.851
After today, we only have
two more sessions left,


817
00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.767
so if you're going
to get your money's worth,


818
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.290
I need your full focus.

819
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:49.206
I am totally...

820
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.904
not focused.

821
00:32:54.734 --> 00:32:55.779
Come on.

822
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.832
All right.

823
00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:05.705
I want to work
on communication.


824
00:33:05.748 --> 00:33:06.880
Actually, King's getting
pretty good


825
00:33:06.924 --> 00:33:07.707
at the whole "sit" thing.

826
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.840
No, your communication.

827
00:33:09.884 --> 00:33:11.407
We need to work
on your voice.


828
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:12.844
We do?

829
00:33:12.888 --> 00:33:17.067
Yeah, it's...
sweet and soft,


830
00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:20.637
and you have
this quirky little twang


831
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.855
that I kind of like.

832
00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.248
Thank you.

833
00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:24.207
But it's ineffective.

834
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:25.469
Oh.

835
00:33:25.512 --> 00:33:27.471
A command should be,
as its name implies...


836
00:33:27.514 --> 00:33:28.429
commanding.

837
00:33:29.822 --> 00:33:32.739
You should be clear,
firm, authoritative.


838
00:33:32.782 --> 00:33:36.004
It doesn't have to be hard
or angry,


839
00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:37.527
just... committed.

840
00:33:37.571 --> 00:33:39.268
Okay.

841
00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:40.923
Exactly.

842
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:43.143
The more commanding you are,
the more successful you'll be.


843
00:33:45.102 --> 00:33:46.712
Well, I, uh...

844
00:33:46.756 --> 00:33:48.237
I don't feel
real successful right now,


845
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.325
in general.

846
00:33:49.368 --> 00:33:50.761
Well, maybe that's the problem.

847
00:33:52.894 --> 00:33:54.244
If you don't feel
like you're in control.


848
00:33:54.287 --> 00:33:55.986
He certainly won't
think you are.


849
00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:58.814
Now, I want you to give this
to King...


850
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:02.036
and I want you
to pull on the other end


851
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.950
and say "Give!"

852
00:34:05.084 --> 00:34:06.824
Here. Give.

853
00:34:06.868 --> 00:34:08.175
Give!

854
00:34:08.218 --> 00:34:09.785
: If you say
his name strongly,


855
00:34:09.828 --> 00:34:10.786
to get his attention,

856
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:12.136
and then say the command.

857
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.051
Yeah, I don't want him
to think I'm mad at him.


858
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:15.183
He won't.

859
00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:16.185
Dogs are very perceptive.

860
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:17.360
They know
how you're feeling


861
00:34:17.403 --> 00:34:19.231
based on your body
language.


862
00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:21.669
Your voice is used to tell them
what it is you want them to do.


863
00:34:23.193 --> 00:34:25.718
Okay. Fine.

864
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:26.675
King, here.

865
00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:29.723
King, give!

866
00:34:29.766 --> 00:34:31.246
Ah!

867
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.466
- Huh?
- It worked.


868
00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:34.120
Okay.
Give him some praise.


869
00:34:34.163 --> 00:34:36.036
Ooh, who's a good boy?

870
00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:37.559
Who's a good boy?

871
00:34:37.602 --> 00:34:40.128
Now, praise should always
be happy, upbeat, assuring.


872
00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:42.956
Basically,
your natural voice.


873
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.350
Definitely better
at that part.


874
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.397
I think you're better
at most things than you think.


875
00:34:51.097 --> 00:34:52.317
Hey, you should come with us
to lunch.


876
00:34:53.753 --> 00:34:54.841
Who, you and Cindy?

877
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:55.930
Yeah, I mean,
it's dog friendly.


878
00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.499
I think it'll help get
your mind off of things.


879
00:34:59.542 --> 00:35:00.718
Well, thanks for the invite,

880
00:35:00.762 --> 00:35:02.677
but I don't want
to crash your lunch date.


881
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.724
I have been the third wheel
plenty of times.


882
00:35:05.768 --> 00:35:06.805
Oh, don't worry,

883
00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:07.844
her husband's
already doing that.


884
00:35:10.049 --> 00:35:11.173
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

885
00:35:11.217 --> 00:35:12.903
You guys just...
you guys seem so close.


886
00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.719
That's because we've been
friends since college.


887
00:35:16.406 --> 00:35:17.617
So, what do you say?

888
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.001
Will there be four wheels
at lunch?


889
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.071
Yeah.

890
00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:30.460
: You know,
talk about routine.


891
00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:32.233
Pizza and a movie,
every Friday night


892
00:35:32.277 --> 00:35:33.963
since our senior year
in college.


893
00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:34.915
Even when you guys
were single?


894
00:35:34.957 --> 00:35:36.384
Especially
when we were single.


895
00:35:36.428 --> 00:35:37.336
Right, Owen?

896
00:35:39.022 --> 00:35:40.493
He's always been
the organized one, even then.


897
00:35:40.536 --> 00:35:44.168
I'd like to say loyal
to our Friday nights.


898
00:35:44.212 --> 00:35:46.937
Except when you bailed on us
with fake laryngitis.


899
00:35:46.979 --> 00:35:48.406
Hey, that worked out,
didn't it?


900
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.007
What worked out?

901
00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:53.423
Owen pretended to be sick
one Friday night


902
00:35:53.466 --> 00:35:54.763
so we'd hang out alone.

903
00:35:54.807 --> 00:35:56.320
He sensed this
before we did.


904
00:35:57.401 --> 00:35:58.482
Thanks, buddy.

905
00:35:58.525 --> 00:36:00.255
Don't say I never did
anything for you.


906
00:36:00.299 --> 00:36:01.553
Owen,

907
00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:03.325
that is surprisingly
sentimental from you.


908
00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:05.574
Well, don't hold it against me.

909
00:36:05.618 --> 00:36:07.477
Or let him fool you.

910
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.153
This man spends his day
surrounded by cute, cuddly dogs.


911
00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:12.796
Underneath his love
of structure...


912
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:13.964
total softy.

913
00:36:15.218 --> 00:36:16.731
All right. Okay.

914
00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:17.812
Did we want
to order the nachos,


915
00:36:17.856 --> 00:36:19.325
maybe share them?

916
00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:21.013
So Owen said you started
your own design firm.


917
00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:22.267
Yeah, I...

918
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:23.651
Yeah, she actually...

919
00:36:23.693 --> 00:36:25.207
she designed the rooftop garden
at the Parker Tower.


920
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.937
Are you serious?

921
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.926
I worked on it
at my last design firm,


922
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:31.001
so not all me, but...

923
00:36:31.045 --> 00:36:33.597
Still, I love that space.
It's so serene.


924
00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:34.548
Thank you.

925
00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:37.704
So, are we ready to order?

926
00:36:40.472 --> 00:36:42.029
Is someone's phone vibrating?

927
00:36:42.072 --> 00:36:43.802
Oh.

928
00:36:43.845 --> 00:36:45.358
Yeah, sorry,
I have to get this.


929
00:36:45.402 --> 00:36:47.045
Excuse me.

930
00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:51.673
Hi, Cassie.

931
00:36:51.715 --> 00:36:53.099
So do you guys want
to share the nachos,


932
00:36:53.142 --> 00:36:54.743
or...

933
00:36:54.786 --> 00:36:55.824
what?

934
00:36:56.991 --> 00:36:59.240
So... this is fun.

935
00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:00.321
She seems really nice.

936
00:37:00.364 --> 00:37:01.489
She's a client...

937
00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:03.261
Mm.

938
00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:04.645
And she was having
a rough day, so...


939
00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:07.153
So you asked
her to lunch?


940
00:37:07.197 --> 00:37:09.229
It was a friendly gesture.

941
00:37:10.743 --> 00:37:11.911
- Sure.
- Sure.


942
00:37:13.597 --> 00:37:15.154
You do still remember
what a date looks like,


943
00:37:15.196 --> 00:37:16.365
don't you?

944
00:37:16.408 --> 00:37:18.180
Look, just because
I took a little time off


945
00:37:18.224 --> 00:37:19.261
doesn't mean a thing.

946
00:37:19.305 --> 00:37:21.121
Is two years little?

947
00:37:21.164 --> 00:37:22.289
Hmm, no.

948
00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:24.365
All right, you see this?
This whole thing?


949
00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.224
You can't do it
two-against-one.


950
00:37:26.267 --> 00:37:28.300
Hey, you're the one
who set us up.


951
00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:34.268
Sorry, I think
I have to go.


952
00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:35.695
Why, what happened?
You get the job?


953
00:37:35.738 --> 00:37:37.986
Uh, she said she's looking
at other designers, so...


954
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.067
Oh.

955
00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:40.148
Sorry.

956
00:37:40.192 --> 00:37:41.317
No, don't be.

957
00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.398
It's totally normal.

958
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.954
To be expected, actually,

959
00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:46.463
but... thank you
for this.


960
00:37:46.505 --> 00:37:47.457
I had fun,
and, um...


961
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.884
it was nice
to meet you.


962
00:37:51.176 --> 00:37:52.344
Come on.

963
00:38:00.992 --> 00:38:02.246
What about
the buffalo wings?


964
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.760
We could get both
and share.


965
00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:05.101
: Mm, yeah.

966
00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:06.441
Tangy or hot?

967
00:38:20.409 --> 00:38:22.484
What... is... that?

968
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.415
Oh, okay.

969
00:38:27.457 --> 00:38:29.014
All right,
all right, buddy.


970
00:38:29.058 --> 00:38:30.614
I'm up.
Thank you.


971
00:38:38.918 --> 00:38:40.474
Whoa. Hey, come on.
We were doing so good.


972
00:38:40.517 --> 00:38:41.512
Whoa, whoa! Come on!

973
00:38:41.555 --> 00:38:42.463
Slow down.
Slow down, buddy.


974
00:38:42.507 --> 00:38:43.544
Where's the fire?
Come on.


975
00:38:43.588 --> 00:38:44.366
Oh, that's a wrong turn
of phrase.


976
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.593
Hey, I'm so glad you're back.

977
00:38:50.636 --> 00:38:53.576
Yeah, well, King clearly knows I
have nowhere to be


978
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.571
because he was determined
to come home.


979
00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:55.739
My guess is that...

980
00:38:55.782 --> 00:38:57.209
Your new client is here.

981
00:38:57.253 --> 00:38:58.290
I'm sorry, my what?

982
00:39:01.274 --> 00:39:02.788
Maybe
I should have called first.


983
00:39:12.301 --> 00:39:14.117
Is it weird
that I feel weird without him?


984
00:39:14.161 --> 00:39:15.415
I know
it's only been a few weeks,


985
00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:18.313
but I feel like I'm missing
an arm or something.


986
00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.566
Well, you could've
brought King.


987
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:20.648
Yeah, I know,

988
00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.032
but Sherry
already claimed him,


989
00:39:22.074 --> 00:39:23.199
and, apparently, he's a big
hit at the fabric store,


990
00:39:23.242 --> 00:39:25.448
and I wanted to give you
my full attention.


991
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.702
Me?

992
00:39:26.745 --> 00:39:28.474
Oh, I'm easy when it
comes to this stuff.


993
00:39:28.518 --> 00:39:30.291
No...

994
00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:31.718
She's the one who's going
to need your full attention.


995
00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:42.702
I feel like I'm in one
of those sleep chambers.


996
00:39:42.746 --> 00:39:44.172
You know, the ones
in Tokyo?


997
00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:45.989
Every time we get
another box of stuff,


998
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.151
I can feel the walls
closing in on me.


999
00:39:48.194 --> 00:39:50.054
I don't think
it's that bad.


1000
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.135
No?

1001
00:39:51.177 --> 00:39:53.037
You see? No.

1002
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.156
Yeah, I actually love
the overall space.


1003
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.670
It's, um...
it's intimate.


1004
00:39:58.183 --> 00:39:59.221
Really?

1005
00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:01.557
Yeah, it's got
that homey feeling,


1006
00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.286
where, you know,
it makes people feel safe,


1007
00:40:03.329 --> 00:40:04.454
comfortable...

1008
00:40:04.497 --> 00:40:05.751
but I'm sorry,

1009
00:40:05.795 --> 00:40:08.475
the furniture and storage
are terrible.


1010
00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:09.434
Hey!

1011
00:40:09.477 --> 00:40:10.610
Finally.
Thank you.


1012
00:40:10.653 --> 00:40:11.741
It's not that bad.

1013
00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:13.048
Like this!

1014
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:13.963
Why do you need
this bulky storage cabinet


1015
00:40:14.006 --> 00:40:15.705
for some papers

1016
00:40:15.749 --> 00:40:17.317
and this one photo?

1017
00:40:20.496 --> 00:40:21.977
Oh, is this that girl...?

1018
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:27.727
Should I just put it back in?

1019
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.425
Or you could just
get rid of it?


1020
00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.993
I just think
that's a bit harsh.


1021
00:40:31.036 --> 00:40:32.125
Or appropriate.

1022
00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:33.867
It's been two years,
or 14 in dog years.


1023
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.480
Why don't I just
slide it back in?


1024
00:40:36.481 --> 00:40:37.483
Look...

1025
00:40:37.526 --> 00:40:38.702
all I'm saying

1026
00:40:38.746 --> 00:40:39.661
is that there's a lot
you could do in here


1027
00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:40.967
in a fairly short amount
of time,


1028
00:40:41.011 --> 00:40:42.317
and pretty inexpensively, too.

1029
00:40:42.361 --> 00:40:44.364
That's great.

1030
00:40:44.407 --> 00:40:46.934
So, will you take the job?

1031
00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:47.936
No.

1032
00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:49.242
: No?

1033
00:40:49.286 --> 00:40:52.247
There is not enough work
for you to hire me...


1034
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:53.554
but I'll help you out.

1035
00:40:53.598 --> 00:40:55.471
Oh, um...

1036
00:40:55.515 --> 00:40:56.952
No, we couldn't do that.
That's just too much work.


1037
00:40:56.995 --> 00:40:58.084
Speak for yourself.

1038
00:40:58.128 --> 00:40:59.739
I'm a desperate woman.

1039
00:40:59.783 --> 00:41:01.263
I will happily
take your help.


1040
00:41:01.307 --> 00:41:03.311
Look, it'll make me feel good,
and I love to work,


1041
00:41:03.354 --> 00:41:05.489
and how about this?
If you love it so much,


1042
00:41:05.533 --> 00:41:07.057
you can give us
a rave review online.


1043
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.146
How's that?

1044
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.497
Yeah.

1045
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:11.760
Sure.

1046
00:41:11.804 --> 00:41:13.634
So, when do you want
to start, roughly?


1047
00:41:13.677 --> 00:41:17.074
Well, I'm free now-ish,
if you are?


1048
00:41:18.206 --> 00:41:19.208
Perfect.

1049
00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:20.254
Great.

1050
00:41:23.346 --> 00:41:25.001
Okay,
this was Cindy's favorite,


1051
00:41:25.044 --> 00:41:26.482
and I have to agree.

1052
00:41:26.526 --> 00:41:28.224
I love vertical storage...
anything with clean lines,


1053
00:41:28.268 --> 00:41:30.577
making sure that
everything has its place.


1054
00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.534
It cuts down
on clutter, and...


1055
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.451
What?

1056
00:41:34.888 --> 00:41:36.630
Come on.

1057
00:41:36.674 --> 00:41:37.501
You don't like structure?

1058
00:41:37.545 --> 00:41:38.982
No.

1059
00:41:39.026 --> 00:41:41.073
No, no, no, no, this is...
this is totally different.


1060
00:41:41.117 --> 00:41:42.162
Is it?

1061
00:41:42.206 --> 00:41:43.120
Come on, admit it.

1062
00:41:45.037 --> 00:41:46.735
Admit what?

1063
00:41:46.779 --> 00:41:48.129
That you and I
have more in common


1064
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:48.870
than you think.

1065
00:41:50.873 --> 00:41:52.266
Does that mean
you're sold on the idea?


1066
00:41:55.621 --> 00:41:56.623
Yeah.

1067
00:41:56.666 --> 00:41:57.624
Great.

1068
00:41:57.667 --> 00:41:58.669
Okay,

1069
00:41:58.713 --> 00:42:00.673
so let's go
into this now.


1070

00:42:47.537 --> 00:42:48.365
and sleep here tonight.

1083

Have you seen her face?

1086
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:54.246
So that's a "yes."

1087
00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:57.164
Can I get one more "yes"?

1088
00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.732
Uh...

1089
00:42:58.775 --> 00:43:00.343
I don't know
what the question is.


1090
00:43:00.386 --> 00:43:01.649
Can I buy you a drink tonight?

1091
00:43:01.693 --> 00:43:03.262
Heh.

1092
00:43:03.305 --> 00:43:04.350
I mean,
it's the least I can do


1093
00:43:04.393 --> 00:43:05.526
for all of your help.

1094
00:43:07.137 --> 00:43:08.096
Yes.

1095
00:43:16.938 --> 00:43:18.592
I've been coming
here for a long time.


1096
00:43:18.636 --> 00:43:20.553
In fact, ever since
we opened Sit for It.


1097
00:43:20.596 --> 00:43:22.469
Mm.

1098
00:43:22.512 --> 00:43:25.213
So do you come for the beer,
the pool, or the fireplace?


1099
00:43:25.256 --> 00:43:26.650
Would you believe fireplace?

1100
00:43:26.693 --> 00:43:27.783
Mm... no.

1101
00:43:28.785 --> 00:43:29.612
You're right.

1102
00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:31.050
It's the pool,

1103
00:43:31.093 --> 00:43:32.269
but my dogs
love the fireplace.


1104
00:43:32.313 --> 00:43:33.314
Your dogs come here?

1105
00:43:33.357 --> 00:43:35.579
Mm, well,
I mean...


1106
00:43:35.622 --> 00:43:37.190
a great place
to train therapy dogs


1107
00:43:37.234 --> 00:43:38.846
not to be distracted
by loud noises.


1108
00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:40.806
Like that.

1109
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:41.677
Yeah.

1110
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:46.250
Yeah, I guess
you could say this is...


1111
00:43:47.906 --> 00:43:48.820
it's kind of my place.

1112
00:43:53.785 --> 00:43:55.527
Hey, the table's free.
You want to play?

Well, I mean...

Wow.

1125
00:44:29.413 --> 00:44:30.719

00:46:57.657 --> 00:47:00.330
but I have one more idea
to run by you.


1150
00:47:02.054 --> 00:47:03.432
Thank you for meeting me.

1151
00:47:03.475 --> 00:47:04.897
Oh, I have to admit,

1152
00:47:04.941 --> 00:47:05.932
your little tease
on the phone


1153
00:47:05.975 --> 00:47:08.517
has me quite curious.

1154
00:47:09.897 --> 00:47:11.447
Well, I was thinking
about how amazing


1155
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:12.654
this magical forest would be
for your baby,


1156
00:47:12.698 --> 00:47:15.930
but realized I had
forgotten one thing...


1157
00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.127
a magical place
for Ginger.


1158
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.290
For Ginger?

1159
00:47:19.334 --> 00:47:21.316
And her puppies,
of course.


1160
00:47:22.436 --> 00:47:23.773
A nursery.

1161
00:47:25.884 --> 00:47:28.987
Actually,
it would be a puppery.


1162
00:47:29.029 --> 00:47:30.193
A puppery?

1163
00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:31.572
A puppy room.

1164
00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:32.736
You said you wanted
a special treat for Ginger,


1165
00:47:32.779 --> 00:47:35.235
so this would be
their special place.


1166
00:47:39.415 --> 00:47:40.923
I don't know
if it's the pregnancy hormones,


1167
00:47:40.967 --> 00:47:42.475
but... I just love that.

1168
00:47:42.518 --> 00:47:44.199
You do?

1169
00:47:44.241 --> 00:47:46.439
I do.
It's very unique.


1170
00:47:46.483 --> 00:47:48.896
Only thing...
Ginger is due in two weeks.


1171
00:47:48.939 --> 00:47:50.232
Can you get both done
in that time?


1172
00:47:50.275 --> 00:47:51.783
Absolutely.

1173
00:47:51.826 --> 00:47:52.861
Really?

1174
00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.713
That mean
we got the job?


1175
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.529
That's okay.
It was a long shot.


1176
00:48:11.692 --> 00:48:12.683
I'm really glad

1177
00:48:12.726 --> 00:48:14.278
that you went
in there swinging.


1178
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:16.217
It was brutal.

1179
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.510
Really?

1180
00:48:18.975 --> 00:48:19.880
No.

1181
00:48:22.078 --> 00:48:23.026
Eye of the tiger, baby!

1182
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:24.319
We got the job?

1183
00:48:24.361 --> 00:48:25.224
We got the job!

1184
00:48:25.266 --> 00:48:26.473
Oh!

1185
00:48:26.516 --> 00:48:28.843
We got the job!

1186
00:48:28.886 --> 00:48:29.748
Hey!

1187
00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:31.429
Hey, we got the job!

1188
00:48:33.584 --> 00:48:34.531
We got the job.

1189
00:48:35.522 --> 00:48:36.514
What?

1190
00:48:36.557 --> 00:48:37.721
We got the job.

1191
00:48:47.115 --> 00:48:48.580
Breathe deeply.

1192
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:53.493
Quiet your mind.

1193
00:48:55.044 --> 00:48:57.242
Nope.
Still not helping, buddy.


1194
00:48:57.285 --> 00:48:59.957
My focus comes
from being centered.


1195
00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.965
Breathing keeps me centered.

1196
00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:09.437
I don't know
what I like more,


1197
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.118
the fact that there are
pen holders in here,


1198
00:49:11.161 --> 00:49:13.057
or actual empty drawers.

1199
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.212
You do realize you need
to get out more, right?


1200
00:49:15.254 --> 00:49:17.669
Said by the man
who refuses to date.


1201
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:20.470
I don't refuse.
I just chose to focus on...


1202
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.779
You said it, not me.

1203
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:25.770
Hi.

1204
00:49:25.813 --> 00:49:27.321
Hey.

1205
00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.476
Sorry, I know our next session
isn't until next Saturday,


1206
00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:31.285
but I got the job,
the Cassie job,


1207
00:49:31.329 --> 00:49:32.450
and it's kind of
because of you.


1208
00:49:32.492 --> 00:49:34.086
Me?

1209
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.337
You talked about your place,
which made me think about King,


1210
00:49:35.379 --> 00:49:36.155
so I gave him a place,
and the next you know,


1211
00:49:36.198 --> 00:49:37.620
I'm designing a puppery!

1212
00:49:38.655 --> 00:49:39.689
Sorry, a what?

1213
00:49:39.732 --> 00:49:40.938
And it's not
just about Cassie.


1214
00:49:40.982 --> 00:49:43.050
It's about all the people
who come with her.


1215
00:49:43.093 --> 00:49:44.429
I'm sorry, a puppery?

1216
00:49:44.472 --> 00:49:46.412
Do you know what that is?

1217
00:49:46.454 --> 00:49:48.178
No, because I made it up!

1218
00:49:48.222 --> 00:49:49.988
Okay, you're spinning out here.

1219
00:49:50.031 --> 00:49:51.368
The nursery, I can do.

1220
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.134
The puppery, I have no idea,

1221
00:49:53.178 --> 00:49:54.987
so that's why I'm here.

1222
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.176
So you want me
to help you with...


1223
00:49:58.219 --> 00:49:59.555
a puppery?

1224
00:49:59.598 --> 00:50:01.624
Just kind of, like,
spitball ideas, that's all.


1225
00:50:03.175 --> 00:50:04.252
Um...

1226
00:50:04.295 --> 00:50:05.689
Okay, I'm really, really,
really open


1227
00:50:05.732 --> 00:50:06.994
because as you know,

1228
00:50:07.038 --> 00:50:07.866
dogs aren't really
my strong suit.


1229
00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:08.823
I mean, they are...

1230
00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:10.174
you are, King...

1231
00:50:10.217 --> 00:50:11.784
but just dogs in general,

1232
00:50:11.827 --> 00:50:12.916
I don't have
that much experience with them.


1233
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.222
Let's go.

1234
00:50:14.266 --> 00:50:15.529
What?

1235
00:50:15.572 --> 00:50:16.791
You said the first thing
that came to my mind.


1236
00:50:16.835 --> 00:50:17.793
Let's go.

1237
00:50:18.794 --> 00:50:20.188
Okay...

1238
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:21.842
Come on!

1239
00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:22.800
Bye!

1240
00:50:22.843 --> 00:50:23.802
Bye.

1241
00:50:38.649 --> 00:50:39.607
I don't understand
what this has to do


1242
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:40.565
with the puppery.

1243
00:50:42.524 --> 00:50:44.136
I just... I want you
to go for it.


1244
00:50:44.179 --> 00:50:45.572
Wait, I'm sorry,

1245
00:50:45.615 --> 00:50:46.965
are we having a session
right now?


1246
00:50:47.009 --> 00:50:48.925
Do you trust me?

1247
00:50:50.448 --> 00:50:53.627
Okay, so you just...
want him to run?


1248
00:50:53.671 --> 00:50:55.238
Seems a little anti-you.

1249
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:57.807
Well, that's why you're both
going to do it together.


1250
00:50:57.851 --> 00:50:59.200
Are you serious?

1251
00:50:59.244 --> 00:51:00.594
You're the one that wanted
to get down and dirty.


1252
00:51:00.637 --> 00:51:01.812
- No!
- Go!


1253
00:51:01.856 --> 00:51:03.293
King!

1254
00:51:08.213 --> 00:51:09.215
Oh, look at that!

1255
00:51:09.259 --> 00:51:11.566
Oh, you're such a good boy.

1256
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.830
Come on, come on!
Let's go!


1257
00:51:17.531 --> 00:51:20.840
Oh, my gosh, I did not know
he could run like that.


1258
00:51:20.884 --> 00:51:22.233
How do you feel?

1259
00:51:22.277 --> 00:51:23.714
Besides out of shape?

1260
00:51:24.889 --> 00:51:27.066
Good, good.

1261
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:29.200
I don't know how that helped
my training skills, though.


1262
00:51:29.243 --> 00:51:31.203
It didn't.

1263
00:51:31.246 --> 00:51:32.466
I'm sorry, what?

1264
00:51:32.509 --> 00:51:34.686
It's not always
about learning.


1265
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.646
It's about feeling.
It's about your bond.


1266
00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:38.691
That sounds
like something I would say.


1267
00:51:38.735 --> 00:51:39.737
Well...

1268
00:51:41.522 --> 00:51:42.480
you're not the only one
learning here...


1269
00:51:44.178 --> 00:51:46.747
and besides, I thought it...

1270
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.053
looked like you two
could use a release.


1271
00:51:53.713 --> 00:51:55.107
It's amazing how happy you are
when they're happy.


1272
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.543
That's why
I feel so lucky.


1273
00:51:56.587 --> 00:51:58.503
I get to work on this every day.

1274
00:51:59.853 --> 00:52:01.333
Did you always know
you wanted to be a trainer?


1275
00:52:01.376 --> 00:52:03.946
I always knew
that I wanted to fix things,


1276
00:52:03.989 --> 00:52:06.254
even when I was little.

1277
00:52:06.297 --> 00:52:10.041
So I started training
therapy dogs, rescue dogs...


1278
00:52:10.084 --> 00:52:12.436
and when I saw how they changed
people's lives...


1279
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:17.356
I couldn't picture myself
doing anything else.


1280
00:52:17.399 --> 00:52:18.923
You know, you're pretty good

1281
00:52:18.967 --> 00:52:22.973
at this whole dog training,
reading people thing.


1282
00:52:23.016 --> 00:52:24.323
You could open
a dozen Sits for Its,


1283
00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:25.237
and they'd all be busy.

1284
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:26.805
Huh.

1285
00:52:28.328 --> 00:52:29.287
Sorry, did I say
something wrong?


1286
00:52:30.505 --> 00:52:31.551
No.

1287
00:52:31.594 --> 00:52:32.900
No?

1288
00:52:35.077 --> 00:52:37.863
It was just something
my ex used to say.


1289
00:52:37.907 --> 00:52:40.214
Oh, right.

1290
00:52:40.259 --> 00:52:41.347
The poodle lady?

1291
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:43.219
Was it that obvious?

1292
00:52:43.263 --> 00:52:44.569
Not on the street, no,

1293
00:52:44.612 --> 00:52:46.354
but Cindy kind of helped
drive it home


1294
00:52:46.398 --> 00:52:47.791
with the whole photo thing.

1295
00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:49.838
Right. Well...

1296
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:52.276
it's not that exciting.

1297
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.540
She thought that I should
expand the business.


1298
00:52:54.584 --> 00:52:56.500
She had a rich uncle
that was willing to invest...


1299
00:52:58.764 --> 00:53:00.156
and I liked it the way it was.

1300
00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:03.771
Apparently, that was
my "lack of ambition."


1301
00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:06.252
Or pride in what you do.

1302
00:53:06.296 --> 00:53:07.384
So, did you break up with her?

1303
00:53:07.428 --> 00:53:09.169
No, she dumped me.

1304
00:53:11.216 --> 00:53:12.392
It was pretty brutal, actually.

1305
00:53:12.436 --> 00:53:14.395
I'm sorry.

1306
00:53:14.439 --> 00:53:16.310
Guess you can't fix
everything, right?


1307
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:20.011
That's a good boy.

1308
00:53:21.362 --> 00:53:22.406
Well?

1309
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.582
How do you feel?

1310
00:53:23.626 --> 00:53:25.541
I feel as ready
as I'll ever be.


1311
00:53:26.934 --> 00:53:27.718
That's a good place to start.

1312
00:53:29.938 --> 00:53:32.551
Hey, um...

1313
00:53:32.595 --> 00:53:34.380
I could come check out
that space...


1314
00:53:34.423 --> 00:53:36.034
if-- if you want.

1315
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:40.084
It's kind of my turn
to help you out now.


1316
00:53:42.957 --> 00:53:43.828
- Oh, hey--
- Oh--


1317
00:53:49.227 --> 00:53:50.359
So yeah,

1318
00:53:50.403 --> 00:53:53.058
uh, if you want
to come look at the place,


1319
00:53:53.103 --> 00:53:55.061
um...

1320
00:53:55.105 --> 00:53:58.066
we have time,
but that would be nice.


1321
00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.285
Okay.

1322
00:53:59.328 --> 00:54:00.374
And Owen?

1323
00:54:00.418 --> 00:54:02.071
Just for the record,
I, um...


1324
00:54:02.115 --> 00:54:04.598
I don't think there'd be space

1325
00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:07.253
for the poodle lady
on the wall anyway.


1326
00:54:07.297 --> 00:54:08.124
You're probably right.

1327
00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:19.314
Okay, I think
we should go with mahogany.


1328
00:54:19.357 --> 00:54:21.883
It's rich and soothing.

1329
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:23.059
We can oil it
and get a darker hue,


1330
00:54:23.102 --> 00:54:24.147
if you want?

1331
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:25.976
That sounds perfect.

1332
00:54:26.019 --> 00:54:27.282
Let me just ask Owen

1333
00:54:27.326 --> 00:54:28.066
about the materials
for the puppery.


1334
00:54:29.284 --> 00:54:30.330
That's a nice excuse.

1335
00:54:30.373 --> 00:54:32.072
What? No!

1336
00:54:32.115 --> 00:54:33.203
No, no, no.

1337
00:54:33.247 --> 00:54:34.641
I'm not...
we're not...


1338
00:54:35.816 --> 00:54:36.948
I don't even know

1339
00:54:36.992 --> 00:54:38.603
if he's over
his ex-girlfriend or not,


1340
00:54:38.647 --> 00:54:41.825
and besides, even if he was,
I don't need the distraction.


1341
00:54:41.868 --> 00:54:42.913
Right?

1342
00:54:44.437 --> 00:54:46.658
Just...
grab the samples, please.


1343
00:54:55.148 --> 00:54:56.585
Hello?

1344
00:54:56.628 --> 00:54:57.500
Hi, Cassie.

1345
00:54:58.892 --> 00:55:00.112
Yes, is everything okay?

1346
00:55:02.594 --> 00:55:04.858
Thank you.

1347
00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:05.859
Hey, Cassie.

1348
00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.862
Hi!

1349
00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:09.517
Uh, on the phone,
you said you needed my help?


1350
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.563
Yes, I've decided
to throw a shower.


1351
00:55:11.607 --> 00:55:13.240
Okay...

1352
00:55:13.284 --> 00:55:14.918
and you want me to help you
plan your baby shower?


1353
00:55:14.961 --> 00:55:16.553
It's a puppy shower...

1354
00:55:16.595 --> 00:55:18.014
actually, more of
a fund-raiser


1355
00:55:18.058 --> 00:55:20.336
for the American Humane
Association...


1356
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.143
but that way, we can totally
show off your work


1357
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.035
and raise money
for a good cause.


1358
00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.455
Great!

1359
00:55:25.498 --> 00:55:26.831
Yeah, and you don't have to do
anything to plan it,


1360
00:55:26.874 --> 00:55:29.368
but I do need you
to have everything done...


1361
00:55:29.412 --> 00:55:30.315
by this Saturday.

1362
00:55:32.723 --> 00:55:35.217
Okay, so...

1363
00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:36.852
that's less than a week away.

1364
00:55:36.894 --> 00:55:39.690
I realize
it's a tad accelerated,


1365
00:55:39.733 --> 00:55:40.808
but I really want
to have this done


1366
00:55:40.851 --> 00:55:42.098
before Ginger
has her puppies,


1367
00:55:42.141 --> 00:55:43.474
and I totally
believe in you.


1368
00:55:43.518 --> 00:55:44.464
I can handle it.

1369
00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.184
You are amazing.

1370
00:55:46.227 --> 00:55:47.087
It's going to be great.

1371
00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:48.464
Okay, honey!

1372
00:55:48.506 --> 00:55:50.011
We've got some planning to do.
Let's go. Okay.


1373
00:55:50.055 --> 00:55:52.119
Let's go.
Here we go.


1374
00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:53.409
Let's go.
Here we go.


1375
00:55:56.677 --> 00:55:57.666
It's Owen.

1376
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:58.871
Hey...

1377
00:55:58.914 --> 00:56:00.162
I might need you
sooner than I thought.


1378
00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:10.053
: Okay,
so it's right around here.


1379
00:56:14.396 --> 00:56:16.676
Okay, so this is literally

1380
00:56:16.718 --> 00:56:18.784
where the magic
is going to happen.


1381
00:56:18.826 --> 00:56:20.503
Hope you're talking
about my amazing skills?


1382
00:56:20.546 --> 00:56:22.009
Owen,
you remember Sherry, right?


1383
00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:23.686
My magical designer.

1384
00:56:23.729 --> 00:56:25.191
She has to say that.

1385
00:56:25.234 --> 00:56:26.223
She's working me
to the bone.


1386
00:56:27.513 --> 00:56:30.137
Well, it's already
looking great in there.


1387
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.255
Thanks.

1388
00:56:31.298 --> 00:56:32.373
Oh, so this is it
over here?


1389
00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:33.405
Yes.

1390
00:56:33.448 --> 00:56:35.254
Hey, Julia?

1391
00:56:35.298 --> 00:56:36.760
Yeah?

1392
00:56:36.803 --> 00:56:39.254
I'm really glad he's not,
you know, good-looking at all.


1393
00:56:39.297 --> 00:56:40.072
Yeah, I told you.

1394
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:42.006
Keep your focus, lady!

1395
00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.770
Laser!

1396
00:56:48.759 --> 00:56:51.210
So I was planning
on dividing the room


1397
00:56:51.253 --> 00:56:53.360
into a feeding, sleeping,
and play area.


1398
00:56:53.404 --> 00:56:54.479
Mm.

1399
00:56:54.522 --> 00:56:56.199
Yeah, no, I like it.

1400
00:56:56.242 --> 00:56:57.661
You're just going
to want to make sure


1401
00:56:57.704 --> 00:56:58.780
you give Ginger a place
to interact with her puppies


1402
00:56:58.822 --> 00:56:59.639
and rest on her own.

1403
00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:00.844
Okay.

1404
00:57:00.886 --> 00:57:02.306
I also wanted a doggy
door to the deck,


1405
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:03.940
but Cassie's hesitant
to cut into the wall


1406
00:57:03.983 --> 00:57:06.735
because she doesn't
want a draft.


1407
00:57:06.779 --> 00:57:08.929
Well, you know, they make
electronic doors now.


1408
00:57:08.972 --> 00:57:10.392
The dogs wear a chip
on their collar


1409
00:57:10.434 --> 00:57:12.068
and the door opens and closes
automatically


1410
00:57:12.111 --> 00:57:13.789
as they approach.

1411
00:57:13.831 --> 00:57:15.595
I would imagine
that would cut the draft.


1412
00:57:15.638 --> 00:57:18.133
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.


1413
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.100
Sorry, nervous tick.

1414
00:57:23.852 --> 00:57:25.701
If you work as quickly in here
as you did in there,


1415
00:57:25.745 --> 00:57:27.078
you'll be done
ahead of schedule.


1416
00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:28.497
I'm not so sure
about that.


1417
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.615
Cassie, this is Owen.

1418
00:57:29.658 --> 00:57:31.636
Oh, are you part
of Julia's design team?


1419
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.927
No, not really.

1420
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:34.776
I train Julia's dog.

1421
00:57:34.819 --> 00:57:37.571
Owen understands dogs
better than anyone,


1422
00:57:37.615 --> 00:57:39.205
so I wanted to
consult with him


1423
00:57:39.249 --> 00:57:41.012
to make sure we didn't
miss anything.


1424
00:57:41.055 --> 00:57:42.173
I love it.

1425
00:57:42.216 --> 00:57:43.807
So do you know
about our little fundraiser


1426
00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:45.442
for the American
Humane Association


1427
00:57:45.484 --> 00:57:46.904
Shelter to Service Program?

1428
00:57:46.947 --> 00:57:48.624
I've worked with them before.
It's a great program.


1429
00:57:48.667 --> 00:57:49.570
What do they do?

1430
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:52.366
It's an extensive process,

1431
00:57:52.408 --> 00:57:53.569
but it's all about training
shelter dogs


1432
00:57:53.613 --> 00:57:55.548
to work
with veterans in need.


1433
00:57:57.054 --> 00:57:58.774
It's some of the most
rewarding work I've ever done.


1434
00:57:58.817 --> 00:58:00.322
Well, I hope you can join us,

1435
00:58:00.365 --> 00:58:02.601
and don't be scared
of the whole "shower" thing.


1436
00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:03.676
There'll be
lots of other guys there


1437
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.666
and plenty of food.

1438
00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:06.214
Are you all set?

1439
00:58:07.332 --> 00:58:08.407
Yeah.

1440
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.913
I'm great, thank you.

1441
00:58:09.955 --> 00:58:10.988
Okay, I'll leave
you to it.


1442
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:12.020
Okay.

1443
00:58:14.601 --> 00:58:16.020
Wow.

1444
00:58:16.062 --> 00:58:16.923
You sound very relaxed.

1445
00:58:16.965 --> 00:58:18.729
I feel very relaxed.

1446
00:58:21.825 --> 00:58:22.944
Let's get to work!
Come on!


1447
00:58:22.986 --> 00:58:25.653
I want this room
cleared, right now.


1448
00:58:25.696 --> 00:58:26.427
So grab
that chair.


1449
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.975
All right.

1450
00:58:28.018 --> 00:58:28.921
Geez.

1451
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:30.985
I thought I was
a task master.


1452
00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:35.587
What?

1453
00:58:35.631 --> 00:58:36.964
Come on.

1454
00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:38.125
Can you grab
this chair?


1455
00:58:52.747 --> 00:58:55.414
Okay, one, two, three.

1456
00:58:56.703 --> 00:58:58.166
Perfect.

1457
00:58:59.456 --> 00:59:00.360
Okay, King.

1458
00:59:02.252 --> 00:59:03.284
Sit.

1459
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:07.929
Shake.

1460
00:59:09.907 --> 00:59:10.896
Stay.

1461
00:59:12.186 --> 00:59:13.175
Stay.

1462
00:59:14.982 --> 00:59:16.014
Stay.

1463
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.821
Stay.

1464
00:59:20.357 --> 00:59:22.164
Okay!

1465
00:59:22.207 --> 00:59:25.089
Good boy!

1466
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:26.378
Ready? Come on!

1467
00:59:53.946 --> 00:59:55.150
Ta-dah!

1468
00:59:55.193 --> 00:59:56.398
Wow!

1469
00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.709
That... is fantastic.

1470
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:00.870
Thank you.

1471
01:00:11.062 --> 01:00:12.186
To the best team
and first project


1472
01:00:12.229 --> 01:00:13.438
a girl could ask for.

1473
01:00:13.482 --> 01:00:14.518
Thank you.

1474
01:00:14.562 --> 01:00:15.469
I will cheers to that.

1475
01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:16.549
Ditto.

1476
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:22.077
I cannot believe
that the shower is tomorrow.


1477
01:00:22.121 --> 01:00:24.108
I can't believe all the people
that are going to be there.


1478
01:00:24.152 --> 01:00:25.447
That list is crazy.

1479
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:27.089
And really fancy.

1480
01:00:27.133 --> 01:00:28.600
Yeah,

1481
01:00:28.644 --> 01:00:30.459
which is why I'm not going
to be able to sleep tonight,


1482
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.581
or eat.

1483
01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.180
You should be very proud.

1484
01:00:33.223 --> 01:00:34.692
They're going to be impressed,
I promise.


1485
01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:36.420
Well, luckily, you'll be there
to tell them that.


1486
01:00:38.104 --> 01:00:39.616
All right, do you guys
want to order?


1487
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.603
It's on me,
so please load up.


1488
01:00:41.647 --> 01:00:43.763
Actually, I can't stay.
It's Friday night.


1489
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.096
Oh, right.

1490
01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:47.090
I forgot.

1491
01:00:47.133 --> 01:00:48.342
What's Friday night?

1492
01:00:48.385 --> 01:00:49.940
Owen's standing date
with his best friends.


1493
01:00:49.984 --> 01:00:52.014
If it wasn't
such a tradition...


1494
01:00:52.058 --> 01:00:53.267
No, totally.

1495
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:54.865
We'll just, uh,
we'll celebrate tomorrow.


1496
01:00:54.908 --> 01:00:56.247
Don't even think
about it.


1497
01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:57.241
Really?

1498
01:00:57.284 --> 01:00:58.580
Yes, totally.

1499
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.870
Okay.

1500
01:01:00.913 --> 01:01:02.425
Bye.

1501
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.188
Great!

1502
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:14.088
If you're paying,

1503
01:01:14.131 --> 01:01:15.729
I'm going to order
a ton of food.


1504
01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:17.155
You would.

1505
01:01:33.873 --> 01:01:35.427
I was just in the area.

1506
01:01:35.471 --> 01:01:37.631
You were just in the area
with flowers?


1507
01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:40.352
Yeah, yeah.

1508
01:01:40.395 --> 01:01:42.037
I generally make a habit
of carrying them around with me.


1509
01:01:42.081 --> 01:01:43.333
Smart.

1510
01:01:46.055 --> 01:01:48.042
I'm sorry I had
to take off earlier,


1511
01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:49.640
but I'd like
to finish celebrating with you,


1512
01:01:49.684 --> 01:01:51.109
if... you're free?

1513
01:01:53.052 --> 01:01:55.169
Free, like... now free?

1514
01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.156
If you can fit it
into your schedule.


1515
01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:15.775
Stop it!
Are you serious?


1516
01:02:17.373 --> 01:02:18.280
: I, uh...

1517
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.075
I thought you could use
a relaxing glass of wine


1518
01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:24.371
in the most beautiful
spot in the city.


1519
01:02:25.926 --> 01:02:28.346
This is gorgeous.

1520
01:02:28.388 --> 01:02:31.455
You were clearly
raised a gentleman.


1521
01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:34.091
Well, my parents
were married 35 years.


1522
01:02:34.133 --> 01:02:35.343
Aw, were they
high school sweethearts?


1523
01:02:35.387 --> 01:02:37.806
Yes, they were.

1524
01:02:37.848 --> 01:02:39.145
What about yours?

1525
01:02:39.187 --> 01:02:40.570
Oh, no.

1526
01:02:40.614 --> 01:02:42.039
No, mine, uh...

1527
01:02:42.082 --> 01:02:43.205
mine have been divorced
since I was in high school.


1528
01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:44.976
Oh... sorry.

1529
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.230
No, don't be.

1530
01:02:46.272 --> 01:02:48.087
They're actually
really good friends.


1531
01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:51.456
They just couldn't juggle
career and marriage together.


1532
01:02:51.499 --> 01:02:53.271
Is that why you put
everything you have


1533
01:02:53.313 --> 01:02:54.264
into your business?

1534
01:02:56.078 --> 01:02:57.201
No.

1535
01:02:57.245 --> 01:02:58.886
No, I, uh...

1536
01:02:58.929 --> 01:03:00.398
I tried both once.

1537
01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:03.335
It just...
didn't work out.


1538
01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:06.446
Well, that doesn't mean
that it can't.


1539
01:03:12.666 --> 01:03:15.043
I can't believe
you did all this.


1540
01:03:15.085 --> 01:03:16.554
Well, thought
you might need a reminder


1541
01:03:16.597 --> 01:03:18.110
of all ways you've made
this city beautiful.


1542
01:03:18.152 --> 01:03:19.664
What?

1543
01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:21.695
Well, here's...

1544
01:03:22.904 --> 01:03:24.632
Astoria Tower
right there...


1545
01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:27.526
and the Margowsky Library,

1546
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.988
and you can see
the rooftop garden


1547
01:03:30.032 --> 01:03:31.759
on the Parker Tower,

1548
01:03:31.803 --> 01:03:33.617
and the Harris Building.

1549
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.432
All the buildings
I worked on at Baluster Bay.


1550
01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:40.356
People are going
to love what you do


1551
01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:41.868
as long
as you believe in it.


1552
01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:48.175
You're too much,
you know that?


1553
01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.760
Like, in a good way?

1554
01:03:51.804 --> 01:03:53.791
Um... yeah.

1555
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:58.801
I can't believe
how late it is.


1556
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:04.115
Thank you for...
everything.


1557
01:04:04.158 --> 01:04:05.670
It's a big day tomorrow.

1558
01:04:05.714 --> 01:04:07.139
Yeah.

1559
01:04:07.182 --> 01:04:08.867
King's graduation
and a puppy shower.


1560
01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:13.705
There's lots
to be excited about.


1561
01:04:13.748 --> 01:04:15.130
Yeah, there definitely is.

1562
01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:32.798
Is he going to get
his nose stuck in the door?


1563
01:04:32.841 --> 01:04:33.835
No, he...

1564
01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:36.514
No, probably not.

1565
01:04:38.889 --> 01:04:39.969
I should, um...

1566
01:04:41.351 --> 01:04:42.172
I should probably go.

1567
01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:44.246
Okay.

1568
01:04:54.786 --> 01:04:55.779
Bye.

1569
01:04:55.823 --> 01:04:57.378
Bye.

1570
01:05:16.342 --> 01:05:18.112
Breathing keeps me centered.

1571
01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:23.640
Light and happy
is my natural state.


1572
01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.526
My light shines from within.

1573
01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:34.134
"Would you like to permanently
delete the meditation app


1574
01:05:34.176 --> 01:05:35.169
from your phone,

1575
01:05:35.213 --> 01:05:36.638
and all of its data?"

1576
01:05:37.674 --> 01:05:39.100
Absolutely.

1577
01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.281
Come on!

1578
01:05:46.915 --> 01:05:48.298
: Well, he stopped
sitting on my feet,


1579
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.506
so that was a good thing,

1580
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:50.629
and then I decided
no more fancy collars.


1581
01:05:51.924 --> 01:05:53.306
I can't imagine
he was a fan.


1582
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.465
He was not, no...

1583
01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:57.582
but other than that,
things are going really well.


1584
01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.137
I clearly had some help, though.

1585
01:06:04.145 --> 01:06:05.398
See?

1586
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:06.607
I told you he was great.

1587
01:06:07.903 --> 01:06:08.939
He kind of is.

1588
01:06:08.983 --> 01:06:11.098
Hey, I know you're super busy,

1589
01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:12.695
but any chance you want
to come share your story


1590
01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:15.201
at the adoption fair tomorrow?

1591
01:06:15.243 --> 01:06:16.496
My story?
Really?


1592
01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.267
Yeah.

1593
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:19.734
Even the bit
where I couldn't get him to sit,


1594
01:06:19.778 --> 01:06:21.634
or sleep,
or even take a treat?


1595
01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.837
Especially those bits.

1596
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:24.788
Those are the things
that show people


1597
01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:25.867
how to be a loving dog owner,

1598
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.155
and you are definitely that.

1599
01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:30.099
Well then,
I would be honored.


1600
01:06:37.612 --> 01:06:39.815
: You know, most
of our graduation ceremonies


1601
01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:41.412
don't have quite as much
pomp and circumstance


1602
01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:42.708
as this one.

1603
01:06:42.752 --> 01:06:43.745
Yeah, that's what happens

1604
01:06:43.788 --> 01:06:44.825
when you organize
someone's office.


1605
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.150
I don't think
that's the reason.


1606
01:06:58.772 --> 01:06:59.679
He didn't!

1607
01:07:09.569 --> 01:07:10.432
Okay. King?

1608
01:07:10.476 --> 01:07:11.555
Sit.

1609
01:07:13.412 --> 01:07:14.794
Stay.

1610
01:07:16.737 --> 01:07:18.161
I'm here

1611
01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:20.408
to present to you
this plaque.


1612
01:07:20.451 --> 01:07:22.178
- It's a real beauty.
- Yeah.


1613
01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:23.603
Just in case
you were wondering,


1614
01:07:23.647 --> 01:07:25.330
these are highly coveted
in the art world.


1615
01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.496
That's good to know.

1616
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.526
You both have shown
huge progress


1617
01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:29.476
in the last four weeks,

1618
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.814
so it's with pride...

1619
01:07:33.017 --> 01:07:34.917
and, I'll admit it,
a little sadness...


1620
01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:39.840
that I declare King...

1621
01:07:39.883 --> 01:07:41.653
and Julia Galvins...

1622
01:07:41.697 --> 01:07:42.560
our newest graduates.

1623
01:07:44.115 --> 01:07:45.022
Congratulations.

1624
01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:46.058
Yay!

1625
01:07:48.218 --> 01:07:49.557
Look, King!
Congratulations!


1626
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:50.506
You're such a good boy.

1627
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.227
He did good.

1628
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.177
You too.

1629
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.300
I tried.

1630
01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.020
So I'll see you tonight?

1631
01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:00.568
Actually, I don't know.

1632
01:08:00.611 --> 01:08:02.123
Oh, you don't know?

1633
01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:05.880
I haven't really found
a date yet.


1634
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:11.235
Can I pick you up at 8:00?

1635
01:08:14.516 --> 01:08:15.553
Yeah.

1636
01:08:23.369 --> 01:08:25.312
This is too dressy for
a puppy shower, isn't it?


1637
01:08:25.355 --> 01:08:27.299
But then again,
it is a fundraiser,


1638
01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:28.724
and a date, so...

1639
01:08:28.766 --> 01:08:29.760
I don't know.
What do you think?


1640
01:08:31.272 --> 01:08:32.610
Well, thanks, sir.

1641
01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:34.683
I think you're right.

1642
01:08:35.719 --> 01:08:37.015
It's perfect.

1643
01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:39.217
I'm coming,
I'm coming.


1644
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.167
I'm coming!

1645
01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:47.897
Hi.

1646
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.099
Hi.

1647
01:08:50.143 --> 01:08:51.999
I, uh...

1648
01:08:52.043 --> 01:08:53.381
wasn't sure what
the dress code was


1649
01:08:53.424 --> 01:08:55.368
for a puppy shower...

1650
01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:57.700
although it's not just
a puppy shower...


1651
01:08:57.743 --> 01:08:59.211
I was right there with you.

1652
01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:02.449
You look incredible.

1653
01:09:02.493 --> 01:09:04.263
Thank you.

1654
01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.386
So do you.

1655
01:09:05.429 --> 01:09:06.769
Thanks.

1656
01:09:20.327 --> 01:09:22.314
I can't believe
the puppies came early,


1657
01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:23.740
and we're just finding out.

1658
01:09:23.782 --> 01:09:24.948
They're so adorable.

1659
01:09:24.992 --> 01:09:25.985
Yeah, at least we know

1660
01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.323
everything's working
in there.


1661
01:09:27.366 --> 01:09:28.533
Yeah, fingers crossed.

1662
01:09:30.476 --> 01:09:32.937
Oh, wow,
everyone's so fancy.


1663
01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.276
Yeah.

1664
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.219
Do you know anyone here?

1665
01:09:36.262 --> 01:09:38.508
Uh, a few,
yeah, actually.


1666
01:09:38.551 --> 01:09:39.458
Quite a few.

1667
01:09:41.401 --> 01:09:42.783
I don't know about you guys,

1668
01:09:42.826 --> 01:09:44.467
but I had no idea what to wear
to this kind of thing.


1669
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:46.972
I think you nailed it.
You look beautiful.


1670
01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.303
Good...
'cause I can't breathe.


1671
01:09:51.031 --> 01:09:52.888
Did you guys see those puppies?
It looks like we staged them.


1672
01:09:52.931 --> 01:09:54.529
I'm going to go up there
for a little cuddle


1673
01:09:54.572 --> 01:09:55.997
before I go and hunt down
some new clients.


1674
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.990
Have fun.

1675
01:09:58.675 --> 01:09:59.624
Well...

1676
01:10:01.352 --> 01:10:02.820
Oh!

1677
01:10:02.863 --> 01:10:03.733
Did he just see me?

1678
01:10:05.123 --> 01:10:06.297
Who are you
talking about?


1679
01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.122
Wyatt Salas. Marine shirt.
Judgmental brow.


1680
01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:09.600
My first rejection
going solo,


1681
01:10:09.644 --> 01:10:11.382
so it still kind of...

1682
01:10:11.425 --> 01:10:12.295
still kind of stings
a little bit.


1683
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:16.337
Well, you should get out
and say hi.


1684
01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:17.988
Julia, this is your event.

1685
01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:20.553
You're right.

1686
01:10:20.596 --> 01:10:22.552
Yeah.

1687
01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:23.726
Hi!

1688
01:10:23.769 --> 01:10:24.594
It's more of a welcome party,
isn't it?


1689
01:10:25.812 --> 01:10:27.420
Everything is
phenomenal.


1690
01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:29.332
Thank you,
and congratulations.


1691
01:10:29.376 --> 01:10:30.332
Thank you.

1692
01:10:30.376 --> 01:10:31.636
Have you tried
the Puppy Punch?


1693
01:10:32.722 --> 01:10:34.156
No, no, not yet.

1694
01:10:34.199 --> 01:10:35.504
Well, you should,

1695
01:10:35.548 --> 01:10:37.286
and also,
please play some games.


1696
01:10:37.329 --> 01:10:38.460
I know
they're totally ridiculous,


1697
01:10:38.503 --> 01:10:40.372
but what I've found is,
over the years,


1698
01:10:40.415 --> 01:10:42.849
people tend to donate more
when they're having fun,


1699
01:10:42.893 --> 01:10:43.848
so go have some fun.

1700
01:10:43.892 --> 01:10:44.761
Okay.

1701
01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:45.718
Okay.

1702
01:10:47.499 --> 01:10:48.369
: Pin the Tail
on the Spaniel?


1703
01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:49.456
Seriously?

1704
01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:51.498
She said to have fun,
so come on.


1705
01:10:51.542 --> 01:10:52.932
Okay.
Sure, whatever you say.


1706
01:10:52.976 --> 01:10:54.149
Okay.

1707
01:10:54.192 --> 01:10:54.975
All right.

1708
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:59.148
Make sure you
cannot see anything.


1709
01:11:00.973 --> 01:11:01.886
It's pitch black.

1710
01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:02.928
Okay.

1711
01:11:02.972 --> 01:11:04.667
Ready?

1712
01:11:04.711 --> 01:11:06.753
One... two...

1713
01:11:06.797 --> 01:11:07.710
Okay, grab this.

1714
01:11:07.753 --> 01:11:09.100
Okay.

1715
01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:10.622
All right, go.

1716
01:11:10.665 --> 01:11:12.708
Okay, wait.
Let me help you out.


1717
01:11:20.053 --> 01:11:21.096
Oh!

1718
01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.008
So close!

1719
01:11:23.052 --> 01:11:24.791
Painfully so, yeah.

1720
01:11:26.051 --> 01:11:26.833
What, you think
you can do better?


1721
01:11:26.877 --> 01:11:28.006
Yeah.

1722
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.397
Oh, well,
let's just get a tail and see...


1723
01:11:31.484 --> 01:11:32.440
Bridget?

1724
01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:34.309
Wow.

1725
01:11:34.353 --> 01:11:36.352
Wha...
what are you doing here?


1726
01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:37.525
I came with my uncle.

1727
01:11:38.525 --> 01:11:41.046
Oh, yeah, of course. Hi.

1728
01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:42.437
So, what are you doing here?

1729
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.436
Just playing...

1730
01:11:45.479 --> 01:11:47.261
Pin the Tail
on the... Spaniel...


1731
01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:52.215
and I helped Julia
with the puppery.


1732
01:11:52.259 --> 01:11:53.910
You must be
Julia Galvins then?


1733
01:11:53.954 --> 01:11:57.083
Yes, that is...
that is me.


1734
01:11:57.127 --> 01:11:58.518
'Scuse me.

1735
01:11:58.561 --> 01:11:59.995
As soon as they asked
about the soundproofing,


1736
01:12:00.039 --> 01:12:01.125
I just froze.

1737
01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:02.430
I'm doing
a horrendous job.


1738
01:12:02.473 --> 01:12:03.212
You're going to have
to explain the concept.


1739
01:12:03.255 --> 01:12:04.124
Come!

1740
01:12:05.471 --> 01:12:06.602
Sorry.

1741
01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:15.251
So, uh...

1742
01:12:22.074 --> 01:12:24.378
: Okay, so you've met
Vince from the opera house,


1743
01:12:24.422 --> 01:12:26.334
and Marlene
from the wine board...


1744
01:12:26.377 --> 01:12:28.420
Ah! What about
Wyatt Salas?


1745
01:12:28.463 --> 01:12:29.420
Oh, no, that's okay.

1746
01:12:29.463 --> 01:12:30.376
No, no. Come here.

1747
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.723
Wyatt?

1748
01:12:31.767 --> 01:12:33.461
I would love you to meet
my brilliant designer,


1749
01:12:33.505 --> 01:12:35.244
Julia Galvins.

1750
01:12:35.287 --> 01:12:36.634
Julia, this is Wyatt.

1751
01:12:36.678 --> 01:12:37.765
We've met.

1752
01:12:37.808 --> 01:12:39.590
Hi there.

1753
01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.372
I have to say,

1754
01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:42.893
I travel

1755
01:12:42.937 --> 01:12:45.805
with my two very spoiled
Jack Russell Terriers


1756
01:12:45.849 --> 01:12:47.327
everywhere,

1757
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.282
and I've never heard
of a puppery before.


1758
01:12:49.326 --> 01:12:52.499
So why doesn't Julia give you
a little tour of the puppery?


1759
01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:55.193
Yes. Sure.

1760
01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:56.410
Awesome.

1761
01:12:56.453 --> 01:12:57.366
Right this way.

1762
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:58.496
Great.

1763
01:13:04.537 --> 01:13:06.102
And this is the puppery.

1764
01:13:06.145 --> 01:13:07.362
Wow!

1765
01:13:10.274 --> 01:13:12.187
I love
the beauty of the panels,


1766
01:13:12.231 --> 01:13:14.664
but it also provides
a soundproof barrier


1767
01:13:14.707 --> 01:13:16.446
between the puppery
and the nursery,


1768
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:17.750
so the puppies
won't disrupt the baby,


1769
01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.619
and vice versa.

1770
01:13:19.663 --> 01:13:21.444
So you thought
of everything?


1771
01:13:21.488 --> 01:13:22.791
We tried to think
of everything,


1772
01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:25.095
which is good,
since...


1773
01:13:26.616 --> 01:13:27.877
they made
an early appearance.


1774
01:13:30.398 --> 01:13:31.745
Now you get
to see it in action.


1775
01:13:32.832 --> 01:13:34.353
I'm impressed.

1776
01:13:34.397 --> 01:13:35.918
Thank you.

1777
01:13:39.829 --> 01:13:41.263
I think it's
perfect for you.


1778
01:13:41.307 --> 01:13:43.393
I'm glad you didn't
listen to me.


1779
01:13:44.914 --> 01:13:45.870
I'm sorry.

1780
01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.739
Everything happens
for a reason.


1781
01:13:50.565 --> 01:13:51.391
I'm glad
you found your reason.


1782
01:13:53.085 --> 01:13:54.824
Julia...

1783
01:13:54.867 --> 01:13:58.214
I think
I underestimated you.


1784
01:13:58.257 --> 01:13:59.518
What?

1785
01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:01.125
What you've done
with these rooms...


1786
01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:02.256
it's, uh,
it's incredible.


1787
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.342
It turns out

1788
01:14:03.386 --> 01:14:05.950
I'm pulling up
the next project,


1789
01:14:05.994 --> 01:14:07.775
and I'm going to need
another designer.


1790
01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:08.993
What do you think?

1791
01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:11.297
I... yeah, I think
that sounds... great!


1792
01:14:11.339 --> 01:14:13.209
I'm sure we can talk
more about it tomorrow,


1793
01:14:13.252 --> 01:14:14.599
but I think...

1794
01:14:14.643 --> 01:14:16.033
I think right now,
I just need some Puppy Punch,


1795
01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:17.381
so... excuse me.

1796
01:14:19.423 --> 01:14:20.510
Okay.

1797
01:14:25.769 --> 01:14:26.726
Hey!

1798
01:14:27.725 --> 01:14:29.246
How'd it go?

1799
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:30.420
I'm sorry?

1800
01:14:30.464 --> 01:14:31.984
I saw you
talking to "judgmental brow."


1801
01:14:32.027 --> 01:14:33.027
How'd it go?

1802
01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:34.810
I don't know.

1803
01:14:34.853 --> 01:14:36.288
What do you mean,
you don't know?


1804
01:14:36.331 --> 01:14:38.156
I don't know
right now, okay?


1805
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.199
Hey, clearly,
you're not okay.


1806
01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.155
Wha...

1807
01:14:42.502 --> 01:14:43.502
Does this have something
to do with Bridget?


1808
01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.197
The poodle owner?

1809
01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:48.631
Yeah... she's my ex,

1810
01:14:48.674 --> 01:14:51.717
but why are you so upset
with me?


1811
01:14:53.716 --> 01:14:54.629
You think
you're the only one


1812
01:14:54.672 --> 01:14:55.628
who can read people?

1813
01:14:55.671 --> 01:14:56.975
What are you talking about?

1814
01:14:57.018 --> 01:14:58.627
You know what?
It's okay.


1815
01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:00.235
I just,
I should've realized it sooner.


1816
01:15:00.279 --> 01:15:02.945
I mean, I kind of suspected it
with you avoiding her.


1817
01:15:02.987 --> 01:15:05.224
Oh, and then there was
the whole photo thing,


1818
01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.471
but... you're not over her.

1819
01:15:06.514 --> 01:15:07.675
I get it.
It's okay.


1820
01:15:07.718 --> 01:15:09.353
No, there's...
there's nothing to get.


1821
01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:13.007
I saw you with her, Owen.

1822
01:15:14.512 --> 01:15:15.459
Julia!

1823
01:15:17.136 --> 01:15:18.082
I don't know
what you think you saw,


1824
01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.630
but it was nothing.

1825
01:15:19.673 --> 01:15:21.221
I'm here with you,

1826
01:15:21.264 --> 01:15:22.296
aren't I?

1827
01:15:22.339 --> 01:15:24.059
I can't do this right now.

1828
01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:25.607
This night
is way too important to me.


1829
01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:26.898
I know,
but we need to talk about it.


1830
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.661
No, we don't.

1831
01:15:28.703 --> 01:15:30.681
I told myself
that I would stay focused,


1832
01:15:30.725 --> 01:15:32.315
that I would not get distracted,

1833
01:15:32.359 --> 01:15:33.692
that I'd focus
on my career first,


1834
01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:34.939
and then...

1835
01:15:34.982 --> 01:15:36.229
Now look at me!
I just spent the past hour


1836
01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:37.820
worried
about a girl I don't even know,


1837
01:15:37.864 --> 01:15:39.454
and a guy I just met.

1838
01:15:41.776 --> 01:15:42.723
Why don't we talk about it
when I take you home?


1839
01:15:45.733 --> 01:15:46.937
Actually, I'm going to...

1840
01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.141
I'm going to get a ride home
with Sherry.


1841
01:15:48.184 --> 01:15:49.732
Are you serious?

1842
01:15:49.775 --> 01:15:50.936
I just can't do this right now.

1843
01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:53.775
Julia!

1844
01:15:55.408 --> 01:15:56.742
You keep saying you want
to lead with love for King...


1845
01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.558
but you can't even do it
for yourself.


1846
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:02.848
I'm sorry.

1847
01:16:52.044 --> 01:16:53.591
What's up, buddy? Huh?

1848
01:16:57.633 --> 01:16:58.666
I know, King.

1849
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:01.418
I'm sad, too,
but it's just...


1850
01:17:01.461 --> 01:17:03.654
less complicated this way.

1851
01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:04.772
We just need
to stay focused, okay?


1852
01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:09.330
Hey, you want some salmon?

1853
01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:10.405
Come on,
let's go get some salmon.


1854
01:17:10.449 --> 01:17:11.610
Come on.

1855
01:17:13.372 --> 01:17:15.480
Well, I think we have
one more free shelf.


1856
01:17:15.522 --> 01:17:18.361
Well, that should hold us
for another week, tops.


1857
01:17:19.737 --> 01:17:20.941
I'm kidding.

1858
01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:22.489
Oh...

1859
01:17:25.413 --> 01:17:26.402
Bad day to joke?

1860
01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:27.908
Mm...

1861
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:28.939
Yeah, maybe.

1862
01:17:28.983 --> 01:17:30.358
Have you heard anything?

1863
01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:33.799
No.

1864
01:17:33.842 --> 01:17:35.734
I'm just going to stick
to what I'm good at...


1865
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:38.830
hanging out
with these guys.


1866
01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:40.594
That's probably
a good idea...


1867
01:17:40.636 --> 01:17:43.861
and if you want,
you could just move in with us.


1868
01:17:43.905 --> 01:17:45.453
We could order pizza
every night,


1869
01:17:45.496 --> 01:17:46.528
just the three of us,

1870
01:17:46.571 --> 01:17:47.904
until we're old and gray.

1871
01:17:47.947 --> 01:17:49.710
You know
I'd personally love that,


1872
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.646
but just so you know,

1873
01:17:51.688 --> 01:17:52.591
you're better
at this whole love thing


1874
01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:53.538
than you think.

1875
01:17:56.118 --> 01:17:57.408
I think...

1876
01:18:00.762 --> 01:18:02.869
there's still space on the wall
for one more.


1877
01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:09.061
Don't give up.

1878
01:18:13.791 --> 01:18:15.512
Well, I feel like a debutante

1879
01:18:15.555 --> 01:18:17.189
after a coming out ball.

1880
01:18:17.232 --> 01:18:19.038
We've already gotten
two phone calls, four emails...


1881
01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:20.974
it's not even noon.

1882
01:18:21.016 --> 01:18:22.049
That's terrific.

1883
01:18:24.585 --> 01:18:25.832
Good.

1884
01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:27.596
Well then,

1885
01:18:27.638 --> 01:18:30.133
I am going to go make us
a super strong pot of coffee,


1886
01:18:30.176 --> 01:18:32.283
because I have
a feeling


1887
01:18:32.326 --> 01:18:34.304
that today
is going to be a busy one.


1888
01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:48.754
I might need
those, buddy.


1889
01:18:51.677 --> 01:18:55.332
You got a call
from someone named Molly?


1890
01:18:55.376 --> 01:18:57.612
I couldn't quite
make out the message,


1891
01:18:57.655 --> 01:18:59.074
but it was something
about a fair?


1892
01:19:05.266 --> 01:19:06.771
Yes.

1893
01:19:06.815 --> 01:19:07.890
Thank you, Mr. Salas.

1894
01:19:07.932 --> 01:19:09.438
We look forward
to seeing you soon.


1895
01:19:11.157 --> 01:19:12.060
He wants us to work
on his new restaurant,


1896
01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:13.437
doesn't he?

1897
01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.727
Yeah, it looks like it.

1898
01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:16.189
I knew it!

1899
01:19:16.232 --> 01:19:17.178
That is amazing.

1900
01:19:17.221 --> 01:19:18.941
Do you realize
how amazing that is?


1901
01:19:18.984 --> 01:19:21.177
Yeah, I do.
It is... it is.


1902
01:19:24.145 --> 01:19:26.123
Wait, maybe
I'm missing something, but...


1903
01:19:27.714 --> 01:19:28.660
why don't you call him?

1904
01:19:28.703 --> 01:19:29.649
You know you want to.

1905
01:19:29.692 --> 01:19:31.326
What are you talking about?

1906
01:19:31.369 --> 01:19:32.444
Please.

1907
01:19:32.487 --> 01:19:33.605
We've known each other
for six years.


1908
01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:34.680
I think you know
who I'm talking about.


1909
01:19:38.077 --> 01:19:39.754
You should've seen them
together.


1910
01:19:39.798 --> 01:19:42.206
Her, actually.
She was... perfect.


1911
01:19:44.356 --> 01:19:46.162
It felt awful.

1912
01:19:46.205 --> 01:19:47.280
I can't be distracted

1913
01:19:47.323 --> 01:19:48.742
by a guy who isn't
even over his ex,


1914
01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:51.451
and even if he is,
it's just...


1915
01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.989
it's just too much
right now, right?


1916
01:19:54.032 --> 01:19:56.624
Right.
I get that...


1917
01:19:56.668 --> 01:19:58.733
but from
where I was standing,


1918
01:19:58.777 --> 01:19:59.831
he was chasing you,

1919
01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:02.161
not her...

1920
01:20:02.205 --> 01:20:04.578
and you did all of this
with him in the picture...


1921
01:20:06.423 --> 01:20:08.225
but you really need to feel that
for yourself.


1922
01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:10.246
I do. I mean...

1923
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:11.740
I did. I just...

1924
01:20:11.784 --> 01:20:13.278
Got scared?

1925
01:20:14.464 --> 01:20:15.958
Maybe.

1926
01:20:16.002 --> 01:20:18.023
Well...

1927
01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.573
then maybe you need
to chase him back.


1928
01:20:23.164 --> 01:20:24.483
We're good to go.

1929
01:20:24.527 --> 01:20:25.757
You ready to tell
your story?


1930
01:20:26.768 --> 01:20:28.218
Yeah.

1931
01:20:28.262 --> 01:20:30.767
You want to know if there was
a lot of early mornings?


1932
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:32.392
Yes.

1933
01:20:32.437 --> 01:20:34.194
To be honest, I had no idea

1934
01:20:34.238 --> 01:20:35.951
just how much a dog
would change my life,


1935
01:20:35.996 --> 01:20:38.720
but he did...

1936
01:20:38.764 --> 01:20:42.938
and it took us a while
to figure each other out...


1937
01:20:42.983 --> 01:20:46.058
what we needed,
what we needed to work on...


1938
01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.343
but then
it just sort of clicked...


1939
01:20:53.968 --> 01:20:56.736
and it didn't matter how much
more complicated my life was


1940
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.318
because of it,

1941
01:20:58.362 --> 01:21:00.691
because of him.

1942
01:21:00.735 --> 01:21:01.965
All I kept thinking about

1943
01:21:02.009 --> 01:21:04.821
was how much richer my life was

1944
01:21:04.866 --> 01:21:06.316
for having him in it.

1945
01:21:08.337 --> 01:21:11.940
It is the best kind
of distraction.


1946
01:21:18.311 --> 01:21:20.245
Okay, I think
we'll wrap this up.


1947
01:21:20.289 --> 01:21:21.827
Who wants to meet
the other dogs?


1948
01:21:31.889 --> 01:21:33.822
I'm not really sure

1949
01:21:33.867 --> 01:21:34.965
that you want to see me
right now,


1950
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:38.612
but I wanted
to give you these.


1951
01:21:38.656 --> 01:21:41.249
You wanted to bring me
dog toys?


1952
01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:46.082
I wanted to test your whole
"lead with love" theory.


1953
01:21:48.982 --> 01:21:49.993
Okay?

1954
01:21:51.663 --> 01:21:52.673
Here.

1955
01:21:56.628 --> 01:21:57.595
The truth is...

1956
01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.319
I'm going to choose you
every time,


1957
01:22:00.364 --> 01:22:02.604
because what we have

1958
01:22:02.649 --> 01:22:04.186
is and will always be
worth fighting for.


1959
01:22:08.317 --> 01:22:10.865
I'm sorry
that I doubted you, Owen.


1960
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:12.843
It was just...

1961
01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:13.897
it was just kind of a lot,
and I just...


1962
01:22:13.942 --> 01:22:15.612
I just froze.

1963
01:22:15.655 --> 01:22:16.974
It's okay.

1964
01:22:17.017 --> 01:22:19.346
I think we were both just
working out the kinks.


1965
01:22:21.411 --> 01:22:22.774
Should we say
it was a warm-up?


1966
01:22:22.817 --> 01:22:23.828
Yeah.

1967
01:22:39.427 --> 01:22:40.570
Okay, King.

1968
01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:42.416
Here.

1969
01:23:02.804 --> 01:23:03.771
Come on!

1970
01:23:05.089 --> 01:23:06.144
Come on.
