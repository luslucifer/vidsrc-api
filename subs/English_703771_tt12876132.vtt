00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:52.739
I'm telling you, Addie,

3
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:54.774
if we build these factories
in San Miguel,


4
00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.978
the business is going
through the roof.


5
00:00:57.044 --> 00:01:00.081
[Adeline] <i>I'd rather have you
than the money.</i>


6
00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:02.917
<i>You're away too much, Slade,
and I...</i>


7
00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:06.087
<i>You okay?</i>

8
00:01:07.654 --> 00:01:10.423
When you're home,
when we're all together,


9
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.559
I never even think about it.

10
00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:14.694
But as soon
as you're away, I...


11
00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:26.173
[sighs]

12
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.442
For God's sake, Addie,
Cambodia was years ago.


13
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.379
Before we were even married.

14
00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:32.947
<i>We were in love.</i>

15
00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:34.849
<i>We were engaged.</i>

16
00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.549
And we've both
seen enough combat


17
00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:38.818
to know that however much
wounds may heal...


18
00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:42.555
How could you do this to me?

19
00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:43.925
I trusted you.

20
00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:45.492
[sobbing]

21

<i>...the scars never go away.</i>

22
00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:55.336
Can I talk to him?

23
00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:57.771
I know. I know.

24
00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:01.008
And I swear to you, Addie,
I haven't lied to you since.


25
00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:02.944
And I will never
lie to you again.


26
00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:05.046
You believe me, don't you?

27
00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.780
Of course I do.

28
00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:08.515
- It's just...
- Can I talk?


29
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:09.984
[Adeline laughs]

30

- <i>Somebody wants you.</i>
- [laughs]


31
00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.255
- I wonder who.
- [Joseph] <i>Hi, Papa.</i>


32
00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:15.957
Hey, buddy. Teeth all brushed?

33
00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:17.524
Yeah.

34
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.161
Read to me.

35
00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:21.461
[sighs] I would, Joe,

36
00:02:21.528 --> 00:02:22.930
but I'm late for
a dinner meeting and...


37
00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:24.165
Just a little.

38
00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:27.034
A little little.

39
00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.535
Hmm?

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.711
[Slade] <i>"The land
was filled with dragons</i>


41
00:02:37.777 --> 00:02:39.280
<i>and the people were afraid.</i>

42
00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.849
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>


43
00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:44.285
<i>to protect both man and maid.</i>

44
00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:48.555
<i>He faced the fiercest creatures
that the world had ever known.</i>


45
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.523
<i>And he did it without any help.</i>

46
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.259
<i>He did it all alone.</i>

47
00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:56.596
<i>And when his work was done,
the dragons were no more.</i>


48
00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:58.899
<i>And so the Knight rode on,</i>

49
00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.902
<i>into legend, into lore."</i>

50
00:03:02.937 --> 00:03:04.537
<i>And that's it for tonight, kid.</i>

51
00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:06.639
More. Please?

52
00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.508
<i>I've gotta go, buddy,</i>

53
00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:10.277
<i>and you've gotta get to sleep.</i>

54
00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:11.212
Okay.

55
00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:15.216
He misses you.

56
00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:17.684
<i>We miss you.</i>

57
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:19.619
I'll be on the last plane
out tonight.


58
00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:23.290
I love you, Adeline Wilson.

59
00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.227
And I adore you, Slade Wilson.

Under the covers,
little soldier.

Aye-aye, Captain.
[grunts]


64
00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:47.048
Read to me, Mama.

65
00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:49.283
- But Papa already read you...
- Please?


66
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.220
Don't give me that wide-eyed
innocent routine, mister.


67
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.622
Please, Mama?

[sighs]

69
00:03:57.058 --> 00:03:59.460
Not that one.
That's just for Papa.


70
00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:03.264
You are clearly the commanding
officer in this family.

No need to panic.

You'd be dead already
if I wanted it.

What do you want?

85
00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:37.958
Your son.

- [bone cracks]
- [muffled screams]


100
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.866
From what I've heard,
you were something to behold,


101
00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.302
before marriage and motherhood
made you soft.

Leader of an elite squad within
the Green Berets called Team Seven.


104
00:07:00.807 --> 00:07:03.344
You trained Slade Wilson.

105
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.980
Helped make him the killing
machine that he is today.


106
00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:08.815
[grunts]
"Killing machine"?


107
00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:10.884
He's a businessman.

108
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:12.785
Oh, Adeline,

109
00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:14.787
there's so much you don't know.

110
00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:16.857
Who the hell are you?

111
00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:18.525
The Jackal.

112
00:07:35.943 --> 00:07:37.978
Molina sent you.

113
00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:40.813
[Deathstroke] <i>El Presidente</i> doesn't
like his generals plotting against him.


114
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:43.217
He finds
revolution distasteful.


115
00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:45.719
Then go ahead.
Cut my throat.


116
00:07:45.785 --> 00:07:48.188
You'll never
get out of here alive.


117
00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:49.556
[Deathstroke] Of course I will.

118
00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:53.427
What is this?

119
00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:54.895
[Deathstroke]
The head of President Molina.


120
00:07:54.962 --> 00:07:57.131
Note the look of surprise
on his face.


121
00:07:57.197 --> 00:07:59.500
Very similar to
how you look right now.

I don't understand.

125
00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:06.774
If Molina hired you
to assassinate me, then...


126
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.808
I'm a mercenary,
not an idiot.


127
00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:11.078
Your president
was an oppressive fascist


128
00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:13.113
who ground his people
into the dirt.


129
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.916
Under his rule,
San Miguel became a cesspool


130
00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:18.018
of poverty, hunger and disease,

131
00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:21.622
while he just grew richer
and fatter.


132
00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:23.290
Do better, General Suarez.

133
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:25.392
Or this will be you.

134
00:08:27.027 --> 00:08:28.395
And, oh, yes,

135
00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:30.931
there is the little matter
of my fee.

<i>Maybe it's time to stop being
a mercenary and start being...</i>


145
00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.369
I'll need transport
ASAP, Wintergreen.

They said it was a miracle

I told you not to volunteer

It was my choice.

164
00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:05.492
I could have said no.

165
00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.960
Then why didn't you?

166
00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:08.863
Because they needed me.

167
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.298
There were only a handful of
men that fit the profile...


168
00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.700
And you've always been
a good soldier.


169
00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:16.203
Maybe too good.

170
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.238
They'll be sending me home
in a few days.


171
00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:19.807
And I'm going with you.

172
00:10:19.874 --> 00:10:21.275
But your duties...

173
00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:23.310
I've served my country.

174
00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:25.145
And done a damn good job of it.

175
00:10:25.212 --> 00:10:27.681
- But you need me now...
- No.


176
00:10:27.748 --> 00:10:29.416
You've got another 14 months.

177
00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:31.585
You do what you
signed on to do.


178
00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:33.787
[groans]

179
00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:37.257
Let me try to build
a life for myself, for us.


180
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:39.326
Then...

181
00:10:39.393 --> 00:10:40.862
Then, if you still want me...

182
00:10:40.929 --> 00:10:43.197
Why wouldn't I want you?

183
00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:44.833
I love you, Slade.

184
00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:46.533
We've got plans.

185
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.235
A whole life ahead of us.

186
00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:51.138
The Army's the only life
I've ever known, Addie.


187
00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:54.341
Being that good soldier.
Following orders.


188
00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:57.277
Killing the enemy.

189
00:10:57.344 --> 00:10:59.513
There's more to you than that.

190
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:02.282
I hope so.

- [glass crunching]


202
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:23.051
Dear God, what happened?

203
00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:24.518
Where's Joseph?

204
00:14:24.584 --> 00:14:27.855
He said if I called the police,
he'd kill him.


205
00:14:28.522 --> 00:14:30.691
Who? Who did this?

206
00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:33.861
Said it's you he wants.

207
00:14:33.928 --> 00:14:34.929
Who did this?

208
00:14:36.097 --> 00:14:37.497
The Jackal.

209
00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:39.766
Who the hell is the Jackal?

210
00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:41.468
You know who he is!

211
00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:43.704
"I haven't lied to you since,"
you said,


212
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.573
"and I will never
lie to you again."


213
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.643
But it's all been
nothing but lies, hasn't it?


214
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.045
I don't know
what you're talking about.


215
00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:52.612
- [stammers]
- Stop!


216
00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:55.515
The Jackal told me everything.

217
00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:58.518
The Army thought
the experiment was a failure,


218
00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:00.387
that their drug didn't work.

219
00:15:00.454 --> 00:15:02.556
That's why they discharged you.

220
00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:05.325
But it just took a little time
to turn you into...


221
00:15:05.392 --> 00:15:07.128
What did he call you?

222
00:15:07.195 --> 00:15:08.395
Deathstroke.

223
00:15:09.463 --> 00:15:11.498
I'm a businessman.

224
00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:14.267
[Adeline] That's what
I always believed.


225
00:15:14.334 --> 00:15:17.437
Slade Wilson, a good
and decent man,


226
00:15:17.504 --> 00:15:19.339
who loved his wife and son,

227
00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:21.541
who'd do anything
for his family.


228
00:15:21.608 --> 00:15:23.911
But you're a goddamn mercenary.

229
00:15:23.978 --> 00:15:27.081
Selling death
to the highest bidder,


230
00:15:27.148 --> 00:15:28.916
and you hid it from me.

231
00:15:30.084 --> 00:15:31.451
All these years.

232
00:15:32.854 --> 00:15:33.754
Why?

233
00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:40.194
I'll bring Joseph back.

234
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.497
And I'll bring the Jackal's
carcass back with me.


235
00:15:43.563 --> 00:15:46.600
I don't need you.
We don't need you.


236
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:48.202
I can do this without you.

237
00:15:48.268 --> 00:15:49.336
[grunting]

238
00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:52.372
Broken, damn it.

239
00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:54.307
In several places,
from the look of it.


240
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:55.575
Go.

241
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:04.551
When this is over, Addie,
we'll talk.


242
00:16:04.618 --> 00:16:06.586
Don't even try
to lie to me again,


243
00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:09.356
you manipulative
son of a bitch.


244
00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:11.525
Just bring Joseph home.

245
00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.928
And God help you if you fail.

246
00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:16.630
I never fail.

247
00:16:19.332 --> 00:16:20.534
[sirens wailing]

248
00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:39.719
[Jackal] How's the wife,
Wilson?


249
00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:40.988
[Deathstroke] Show yourself.

250
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:48.029
I'm right here.

251
00:16:49.462 --> 00:16:50.730
My son...

252
00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:53.600
[Jackal] Is fine.
Just a bargaining chip.


253
00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:56.436
Accept the bargain
and he doesn't get hurt.


254
00:16:56.503 --> 00:16:58.471
I won't work with H.I.V.E.

255
00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:00.640
[Jackal] So you said
the last time I asked.


256
00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:02.009
And I respect that.

257
00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:05.046
Unfortunately,
my superiors don't.


258
00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:12.320
They think your skills
would be of great value to us.


259
00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:13.687
You're terrorists.

260
00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:15.957
[Jackal]
Equal opportunity murderers.


261
00:17:16.023 --> 00:17:18.425
Selling our services
to the highest bidder,


262
00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:19.861
just like you.

263
00:17:19.927 --> 00:17:22.462
Only difference is
you're small-time.


264
00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:24.564
H.I.V.E. thinks globally.

265
00:17:24.631 --> 00:17:25.900
[Deathstroke]
How many innocent people,


266
00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:29.303
women and children
have died at your hands?


267
00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:32.006
[Jackal] Honestly,
I've lost count.


268
00:17:32.073 --> 00:17:36.277
But we're all murderers
under the skin, Wilson.


269
00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:38.279
It's just a matter of scale.

270
00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:41.983
Morality is delusion that fools
wear like a comforting cloak.


271
00:17:43.017 --> 00:17:45.452
But you're no fool.
Are you?


272
00:17:45.518 --> 00:17:48.256
A monster perhaps,
but not a fool.


273
00:17:48.322 --> 00:17:49.623
[Deathstroke] Monster?

274
00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:52.193
Yes, I kill for a living.

275
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.228
But only if the cause is right.

276
00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:56.197
There are lines I won't cross.

277
00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:58.132
[Jackal] I don't know
if the widows and children


278
00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:01.601
of those soldiers you murdered
in San Miguel would agree.


279
00:18:02.303 --> 00:18:03.570
We're the same.

280
00:18:03.637 --> 00:18:05.039
Can't you see that?

281
00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:08.508
Men like us pretend
to have hearts and souls.


282
00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:09.743
But underneath that,

283
00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:11.611
only darkness.

284
00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:15.582
[Deathstroke] I...

285
00:18:19.153 --> 00:18:21.822
The answer is no.

286
00:18:23.257 --> 00:18:24.557
[Jackal] Reconsider.

You do realize
that you've proven my point.


295

She was
an extraordinary operative.


296
00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:38.065
But clearly
not extraordinary enough.

That whatever the Army did to
alter your biology, your genetics,


391

was passed on to Joseph?

Of course not.

00:28:03.036 --> 00:28:04.538
From what
that H.I.V.E. Queen said,

00:28:04.605 --> 00:28:06.573
his abilities are
very different than mine.

feel him.

399
00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:17.584
As if he was
in the room with me.


400
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:20.287
But I thought
I was just imagining it.


401
00:28:20.354 --> 00:28:21.622
He should have been with you.

402
00:28:21.688 --> 00:28:23.156
How could you just
send him away like that?


403
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:25.325
I did it to keep him safe.

404
00:28:25.392 --> 00:28:26.961
[Slade] I could have
kept him safe.


405
00:28:27.027 --> 00:28:28.529
[Adeline] The way you did
last time?


406
00:28:28.595 --> 00:28:31.431
When that animal cut his
throat and left him mute?


407
00:28:31.498 --> 00:28:33.935
You punished me enough
for it, didn't you?


408
00:28:34.002 --> 00:28:35.435
Locked me out of his life.

409
00:28:38.171 --> 00:28:40.040
And you never
once questioned it.


410
00:28:40.107 --> 00:28:41.608
Never once tried to see him.

411
00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:44.144
Another man would have
fought me tooth and nail,


412
00:28:44.211 --> 00:28:46.213
would have begged
to see his son.


413

But you? One pathetic letter,

414

and then you were gone forever.

00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:52.486
Why?

416
00:28:52.553 --> 00:28:55.289
I always seem to be
asking you that. Why?


417
00:28:55.355 --> 00:28:56.925
The past is dead, Addie,

418
00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:59.359
and nothing we do,
nothing we say, can change it.


419
00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:01.495
But the past isn't dead, Slade.

420
00:29:01.562 --> 00:29:04.364
It's happening all over again.

421
00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:05.967
So what are we
going to do about it?

You're not going after him
alone this time.

I'm going with you.

Do you remember
what the Jackal did to you?

Oh, I remember.

00:29:14.675 --> 00:29:17.678
He broke me.
Humiliated me.

And it was my own fault.

487
00:34:09.837 --> 00:34:12.606
I've worked for both sides.
They're very generous.


488
00:34:12.672 --> 00:34:15.809
And children starve.
Innocents die.


489
00:34:15.877 --> 00:34:18.712
Still singing the same song,
huh, Wilson?


490
00:34:18.778 --> 00:34:20.814
The mercenary
with a conscience.


491
00:34:20.882 --> 00:34:22.515
The rest of us...

492
00:34:22.582 --> 00:34:23.951
we're beneath you!

493
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.389
[spits]

494
00:34:29.456 --> 00:34:32.459
I didn't come here
to debate, Tiger.


495
00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:34.561
- [groans]
- Or to fight.


496
00:34:34.628 --> 00:34:37.397
I came here for information.

497
00:34:37.464 --> 00:34:39.399
If it's dope on H.I.V.E.
you want...


498
00:34:51.811 --> 00:34:53.546
You have nothing
to do with them.


499
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.448
Didn't even know
they still existed.


500
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.118
[both grunting]

501
00:35:03.556 --> 00:35:05.458
- [groaning]
- Oh, I knew.


502
00:35:05.525 --> 00:35:07.194
Once the Jackal took over.

503
00:35:09.263 --> 00:35:11.032
Jackal? He's alive?

504
00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:16.670
You should've made sure
he was dead.


505
00:35:17.537 --> 00:35:19.106
[grunting]

506
00:35:19.173 --> 00:35:22.575
That man has
a serious hate on for you.


507
00:35:23.443 --> 00:35:24.511
[both grunting]

508
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.249
After that mess with your kid,

509
00:35:28.316 --> 00:35:31.451
Jackal decided that H.I.V.E.
needed reorganization.


510
00:35:31.518 --> 00:35:34.554
New leadership.
So he stepped back.


511
00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:37.657
[Deathstroke straining] And let
me wipe out his competition.


512
00:35:37.724 --> 00:35:38.926
[both grunting]

513
00:35:42.529 --> 00:35:46.133
And then, very quietly,
put the pieces back together.


514
00:36:07.888 --> 00:36:10.057
But I was tired
of taking orders.


515
00:36:10.124 --> 00:36:11.524
Decided to freelance.

516
00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:15.229
Worked out pretty well.

517
00:36:15.296 --> 00:36:16.163
[yells]

518
00:36:21.302 --> 00:36:22.436
[electricity crackling]

519
00:36:22.502 --> 00:36:23.636
[Tiger groans]

520
00:36:29.443 --> 00:36:30.744
Again?

521
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.413
Son of a bitch.

522
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.448
You did it again.

523
00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:36.884
Where can I find
the H.I.V.E Queen?


524
00:36:40.553 --> 00:36:41.755
[breathing heavily]

525
00:36:44.591 --> 00:36:45.759
[gun cocking]

526
00:36:49.363 --> 00:36:50.563
[exhales sharply]

527
00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:52.799
Fine.

528
00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:54.534
The Kerguelen Islands.

529
00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:56.636
[Deathstroke] Thank you.

530
00:36:57.304 --> 00:36:58.406
[airplane hovering]

531
00:36:58.472 --> 00:36:59.806
That's my ride.

532
00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:13.620
Don't bother.

533
00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:16.290
Where he's headed,
there's no coming back.


534
00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:20.895
Oh, shit.

535
00:37:33.207 --> 00:37:36.810
So, how the hell did you get your
hands on an aircraft like this?


536
00:37:36.877 --> 00:37:38.312
Somebody owed me a favor.

537
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:40.181
A very big one, apparently.

538
00:37:41.815 --> 00:37:43.517
There's every chance
they know you're coming.


539
00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:44.784
I'm counting on it.

540
00:37:44.852 --> 00:37:46.586
[scoffs] You'll never change.

541
00:37:46.653 --> 00:37:48.456
Having second thoughts,
Wintergreen?


542
00:37:48.522 --> 00:37:49.656
On the contrary.

543
00:37:49.722 --> 00:37:51.758
Since MI6 retired me,

544
00:37:51.826 --> 00:37:56.230
the only fun I ever have is when you
invite me along on these little jaunts.


545
00:37:56.297 --> 00:37:58.065
I'll be too old for this
soon enough.


546
00:37:58.132 --> 00:38:00.935
Well, I'm probably
too old for it now,


547
00:38:01.001 --> 00:38:03.237
but I'm not ready
for the nursing home just yet.


548
00:38:03.304 --> 00:38:04.839
This one's no jaunt.

549
00:38:04.905 --> 00:38:06.574
Joseph's life is at stake.

550
00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.175
And what kind of
godfather would I be


551
00:38:08.242 --> 00:38:10.511
if I wasn't helping you
bring him home?


552
00:38:10.578 --> 00:38:11.946
In fact, I...

553
00:38:12.612 --> 00:38:14.515
There they are.

554
00:38:14.582 --> 00:38:19.053
The Kerguelens. Also known as
the Desolation Islands.


555
00:38:19.786 --> 00:38:21.222
Aptly named, I think.

556
00:38:29.163 --> 00:38:30.831
[Wintergreen]
<i>Best of luck, Slade.</i>


557
00:38:30.898 --> 00:38:32.933
I don't believe in luck.

558
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.336
But in this case, I'll take it.

559
00:39:17.178 --> 00:39:18.045
[groans]

560
00:39:54.781 --> 00:39:56.483
I was expecting an army.

561
00:39:57.717 --> 00:39:59.286
[Lady Shiva]
They don't need an army.


562
00:40:00.654 --> 00:40:02.356
They've got me.

563
00:40:02.423 --> 00:40:06.160
[Deathstroke] Sandra Wu San.
Also known as Lady Shiva.


564
00:40:06.227 --> 00:40:08.028
There are people
who consider you


565
00:40:08.095 --> 00:40:10.831
the deadliest hand-to-hand
combatant in the world.


566
00:40:10.898 --> 00:40:12.399
And they would be right.

567
00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:13.334
[grunts]

568
00:40:18.439 --> 00:40:19.873
What are you doing?

569
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.242
Surrendering.

570
00:40:21.308 --> 00:40:23.743
I do not accept your surrender.

571
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.312
[Queen] <i>Not tonight, Shiva.</i>

572
00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:26.614
<i>I want him alive.</i>

573
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.881
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

574
00:40:27.948 --> 00:40:29.316
[Lady Shiva grunts]

575
00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:30.951
Yes, my Queen.

576
00:40:31.552 --> 00:40:32.419
Up.

577
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.407
[Queen] Surrender
is a clever strategy.


578
00:40:53.474 --> 00:40:56.510
Easier than fighting
your way into the fortress.


579
00:40:56.577 --> 00:40:59.079
But it won't be
quite as easy getting out.


580
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:02.983
What?

581
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.551
[Deathstroke]
You're just a child.


582
00:41:13.127 --> 00:41:16.230
And you're a dinosaur
whose time has passed.


583
00:41:18.798 --> 00:41:19.867
[gasps]

584
00:41:20.968 --> 00:41:22.870
Let's cut the bullshit,
shall we?


585
00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:25.439
Where's my boy? 
Where's Joseph.

586
00:41:26.307 --> 00:41:29.043
Yes. Let's cut the bullshit.

587
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.715
Where is he?

588
00:41:34.782 --> 00:41:36.317
Such concern.

589
00:41:36.383 --> 00:41:39.920
And yet, you abandoned Joseph
without a second thought


590
00:41:39.987 --> 00:41:41.689
just as his mother did.

591
00:41:41.755 --> 00:41:45.859
Left him trapped, isolated,
friendless in that school.


592
00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:49.396
His mind, his very soul,
on fire.


593
00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:50.898
I didn't know.

594
00:41:50.964 --> 00:41:52.099
Could it be...

595
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:55.402
you didn't want to?

596
00:41:57.304 --> 00:42:00.741
So, he's what,
your little lab rat?


597
00:42:00.808 --> 00:42:02.576
[Queen] We're going
to train him.


598
00:42:02.643 --> 00:42:05.012
Help him master his powers.

599
00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:07.214
[Deathstroke] You've got him
locked in a damn cage.


600
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:09.016
[Queen] For his own protection.

601
00:42:09.083 --> 00:42:12.853
His psychic energies
are still wildly unstable.


602
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.221
But his potential,

603
00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:15.889
limitless.

604
00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:18.592
- As a weapon.
- Yes.


605
00:42:19.326 --> 00:42:20.761
Think of it.

606
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:24.298
Manipulation on a global scale
through the power of the mind.


607
00:42:24.365 --> 00:42:27.167
Domination of the planet
with no bullets.


608
00:42:27.234 --> 00:42:28.302
No bombs.

609
00:42:28.369 --> 00:42:32.005
What country on Earth
could resist us?


610
00:42:36.076 --> 00:42:37.511
Joseph? Joseph!

611
00:42:38.912 --> 00:42:40.013
Joseph!

612
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.148
Don't be afraid.

613
00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:46.153
Joe...

614
00:42:48.555 --> 00:42:51.325
"Joseph" was the name
you gave him.


615
00:42:52.192 --> 00:42:53.927
But I've given him a new name.

616
00:42:53.994 --> 00:42:55.362
A better name.

617
00:42:55.864 --> 00:42:57.164
Jericho.

618
00:42:57.231 --> 00:42:58.899
Because, with my help,

619
00:42:58.966 --> 00:43:03.270
he's going to bring the walls
of the old order tumbling down.


620
00:43:07.975 --> 00:43:09.510
Be honest, Wilson.

621
00:43:09.576 --> 00:43:11.478
You don't really
care about him.


622
00:43:12.045 --> 00:43:13.280
You never did.

623
00:43:13.347 --> 00:43:15.449
This is just another
adventure to you.


624
00:43:15.516 --> 00:43:18.685
Another chance to prove
your questionable manhood.


625
00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:20.287
But here,

626
00:43:21.155 --> 00:43:24.191
he'll find a home, a family.

627
00:43:27.728 --> 00:43:29.663
[Joseph] <i>Help me, Papa.</i>

<i>Get me out of here!</i>

00:43:31.498 --> 00:43:32.366
<i>Please!</i>

630
00:43:33.734 --> 00:43:35.002
Get back, buddy.

638
00:44:48.442 --> 00:44:49.376
Joe.

<i>I know a way out.</i>

00:44:55.315 --> 00:44:56.885
<i>This will get us
to the surface.</i>


641
00:44:56.951 --> 00:44:58.853
<i>But I don't know what to do
once we're up there.</i>


642
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.220
I've got that covered.

Wintergreen, it's time.

Joseph, why?

656
00:45:32.386 --> 00:45:35.389
Did you really think
I would betray my own sister?

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.057
Sister?

658
00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:48.036

I've been on you
the whole time.


706
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:49.884
Used a nano-tracker that I
procured from an old friend.


707
00:48:49.951 --> 00:48:53.386
Tiny GPS device that lodged
into your intestinal tract.

- But how did...
- Sealed with a kiss.

It's got a limited shelf life.

Drink this.

715
00:49:16.476 --> 00:49:19.746
A mix of herbs that should help
speed up your natural healing.

Ugh.

Wait.

720
00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:33.693
You said you got your tracker
from an old friend.

You two have been conspiring?

Not conspiring,

724
00:49:39.399 --> 00:49:43.004
just sharing information
and resources.


725

When I see that old man...

726

If you're going to be angry
at someone, try yourself.

You've made some terrible
choices in your life, Slade.

And the people you love,

that you claim to love,

730
00:49:54.548 --> 00:49:56.516
have paid a terrible price.

731
00:50:02.123 --> 00:50:03.891
[Jackal] So he's dead?

732
00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:06.593
The sharks have made
a meal of him by now.


733
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.596
You must feel a profound sense
of satisfaction, Rose.

00:50:10.231 --> 00:50:12.033
I wish I did.

735
00:50:12.099 --> 00:50:15.735
I've wanted this for so long,
but now that I have it...

00:50:15.802 --> 00:50:18.873
Let it go, child.
You've done well.

Made me proud.

00:50:20.241 --> 00:50:22.109
Now let's move on
with our plans.


739
00:50:23.044 --> 00:50:24.544
We need more time.

740
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:26.013
Jericho is not ready.

741
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.116
You'll make sure he's ready,
won't you?

00:50:29.183 --> 00:50:30.852
- But...
- Won't you?

00:50:31.818 --> 00:50:33.020
Yes.

744
00:50:33.087 --> 00:50:34.421
I have faith in you, Rose.

745
00:50:34.487 --> 00:50:36.656
I've always had faith in you.

746
00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:38.658
Since the day we met

747
00:50:38.725 --> 00:50:42.330
and I rescued you
from a hellish existence.


748

Made you a queen.

And now, you'll make

You know I have to
remain in seclusion.

No one can know

But this, child,

795

[Slade] I didn't know
Lillian was pregnant.

She never told me.

that you were to Joseph?

802
00:53:11.345 --> 00:53:13.981
Years ago, when you told me
about Lillian,


803
00:53:14.048 --> 00:53:16.283
you said she didn't mean
anything to you.


804
00:53:17.784 --> 00:53:18.886
Was that true?

805
00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.587
She didn't.

806
00:53:20.653 --> 00:53:22.289
Not like you, Addie.

807
00:53:22.356 --> 00:53:23.623
But?

808
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.593
After I realized
what had happened to me...


809
00:53:26.659 --> 00:53:28.963
what the army
had turned me into, I felt...


810
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.297
lost.

811
00:53:31.065 --> 00:53:32.133
Untethered.

812
00:53:32.199 --> 00:53:34.335
I needed time
to sort through things.


813
00:53:34.402 --> 00:53:36.669
So, I travelled. 
Looking for...

814
00:53:36.736 --> 00:53:38.671
Something I couldn't give you?

815
00:53:38.738 --> 00:53:40.074
I don't know.

816
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:42.542
Maybe it was easier
turning to a stranger.


817
00:53:42.609 --> 00:53:44.512
Lillian was a good woman.

818
00:53:44.577 --> 00:53:46.313
Sweet. Kind.

819
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.848
So you did care about her.

820
00:53:47.915 --> 00:53:49.116
Yes. But not like...

821
00:53:49.183 --> 00:53:51.718
And just left her,
pregnant and alone.


822
00:53:51.785 --> 00:53:53.921
I didn't know about the child.

823
00:53:53.988 --> 00:53:55.823
Would you rather I'd stayed
with her and not...


824
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.757
I'd rather
it had never happened.


825
00:53:57.825 --> 00:53:59.559
It sounds funny, I know.

826
00:53:59.626 --> 00:54:01.095
But my affair with Lillian,

827
00:54:01.162 --> 00:54:04.331
it's what made me realize
that you were the only one.


828
00:54:04.398 --> 00:54:05.366
That no other woman could...

829
00:54:05.433 --> 00:54:06.834
I'm not laughing.

830
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:08.502
I didn't mean it like that.

831
00:54:08.568 --> 00:54:10.037
What did you mean?

832
00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:11.305
Addie, I...

833
00:54:18.012 --> 00:54:20.814
Doesn't matter now, does it?

834
00:54:21.315 --> 00:54:22.516
No.

835
00:54:22.582 --> 00:54:23.984
Not when you
destroyed our family,


836
00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:26.187
and another one
you didn't even know you had.


837
00:54:26.253 --> 00:54:28.721
That's your forte, isn't it?
Destruction.


838
00:54:28.788 --> 00:54:31.492
If you feel that way,
then why the hell are you helping me?


839
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:33.227
I'm not helping you.

840
00:54:33.294 --> 00:54:34.594
I'm helping Joseph.

841
00:54:34.661 --> 00:54:36.197
And once this is done,

842
00:54:36.729 --> 00:54:37.932
so are we.

843
00:54:44.105 --> 00:54:46.773
[Joseph] <i>We did
the right thing, didn't we?</i>


844
00:54:47.508 --> 00:54:48.476
Yes.

845
00:54:48.542 --> 00:54:50.377
Of course, we did.

846
00:54:50.444 --> 00:54:52.379
He was a monster.

847
00:54:52.446 --> 00:54:54.415
He had to die.

848
00:54:54.482 --> 00:54:56.150
<i>He was a knight once.</i>

849
00:54:56.217 --> 00:54:57.451
What?

850
00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:58.718
[stammers] <i>Nothing.</i>

851
00:55:00.254 --> 00:55:02.990
I know a part of you
still loves them.


852
00:55:03.623 --> 00:55:05.359
You can't help it.

853
00:55:05.426 --> 00:55:09.629
But Slade Wilson
never gave a damn about you.


854
00:55:09.696 --> 00:55:11.764
His entire life was a lie.

855
00:55:12.333 --> 00:55:13.766
And your mother,

856
00:55:13.834 --> 00:55:15.569
if she really loved you,

857
00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:18.771
would she have locked
you away in that school,


858
00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:20.374
left you there to rot?

859
00:55:22.076 --> 00:55:23.511
Would she?

860
00:55:23.577 --> 00:55:24.711
<i>No.</i>

861
00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:42.062
We were both so alone, Jericho.

862
00:55:42.129 --> 00:55:43.796
So alone.

863
00:55:43.864 --> 00:55:46.967
But we found each other,
didn't we?


864
00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:52.739
I guess we can thank
Deathstroke for that much.


865
00:55:52.805 --> 00:55:54.807
Years before we ever met,

866
00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:57.111
your mind reached out,

867
00:55:57.178 --> 00:55:58.212
found me.

868
00:55:58.279 --> 00:55:59.679
We knew each other,

869
00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:04.218
shared each other's thoughts,
feelings, all our hopes,


870
00:56:04.784 --> 00:56:06.187
all our sorrows.

871
00:56:06.887 --> 00:56:08.222
When this...

872
00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:11.525
this power inside me
came alive,


873
00:56:11.592 --> 00:56:13.760
I was so scared, Rose.

874
00:56:13.827 --> 00:56:16.297
I thought it was
going to burn me up,


875
00:56:16.363 --> 00:56:17.865
tear me apart.

876
00:56:17.932 --> 00:56:20.434
But then, I felt something.

877
00:56:20.501 --> 00:56:21.635
Like...

878
00:56:21.701 --> 00:56:23.971
Like the echo
of my own soul.


879
00:56:24.538 --> 00:56:25.406
Me.

880
00:56:26.674 --> 00:56:28.042
You.

881
00:56:28.108 --> 00:56:30.077
I think I would have died
without you.


882
00:56:31.912 --> 00:56:34.181
And I would have died
without you.


883
00:56:36.749 --> 00:56:38.751
You see, Jericho,

884
00:56:38.818 --> 00:56:41.255
you don't need
a mother or a father...


885
00:56:44.458 --> 00:56:45.926
when you have me.

886
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:53.067
[Joseph] <i>And what about the man
who calls himself your father?</i>


887
00:56:53.133 --> 00:56:54.734
<i>What about the Jackal?</i>

888
00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:03.844
Wintergreen, you there?

889
00:57:05.212 --> 00:57:06.513
[Wintergreen] <i>Always.</i>

890
00:57:22.162 --> 00:57:23.864
Hey, what about the boat?

891
00:57:25.366 --> 00:57:26.300
[rapid beeping]

892
00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:27.835
[explosion]

893
00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.270
I stole it, anyway.

894
00:57:43.384 --> 00:57:44.451
Bring them in.

895
00:57:51.825 --> 00:57:54.128
Thank you, agents,
for volunteering.


896
00:57:54.194 --> 00:57:56.030
But we didn't volun...

897
00:57:58.265 --> 00:58:00.901
Agent Sanchez, step forward.

898
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.341
<i>On your knees.</i>

899
00:58:10.177 --> 00:58:11.045
Now her.

900
00:58:14.014 --> 00:58:15.249
<i>Your weapon.</i>

901
00:58:21.555 --> 00:58:23.791
This is nothing
compared to what's coming.


902
00:58:23.857 --> 00:58:27.895
And if you can't do this,
all our plans are for nothing.


903
00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:29.530
[Joseph] <i>All right.</i>

904
00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:34.034
<i>Shoot him.</i>

905
00:58:34.101 --> 00:58:35.302
[gun cocking]

906
00:58:47.548 --> 00:58:48.415
<i>I can't.</i>

907
00:58:52.886 --> 00:58:54.488
Why'd you stop?

908
00:58:54.555 --> 00:58:55.889
<i>It worked, didn't it?</i>

909
00:58:55.956 --> 00:58:57.925
<i>She would've killed him
on my command.</i>


910
00:58:57.991 --> 00:59:00.027
<i>Why lose
a perfectly good agent?</i>


911
00:59:00.794 --> 00:59:02.262
Fine.

912
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:05.165
Then let's have a show,
shall we?


913
00:59:08.837 --> 00:59:10.471
[grunting]

914
00:59:10.537 --> 00:59:11.405
[both grunting]

915
00:59:20.047 --> 00:59:21.115
[grunting]

916
00:59:28.823 --> 00:59:30.057
That's enough, Jericho.

917
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.367
That's enough.

918
00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.641
Jericho, stop!

919
00:59:48.509 --> 00:59:49.376
Stop!

920
01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:05.692
[Joseph] <i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

921
01:00:05.759 --> 01:00:08.095
<i>I'm sorry, Rose.
I don't know what happened!</i>


922
01:00:08.162 --> 01:00:10.063
<i>I couldn't control it! I...</i>

923
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.366
Shh! It's my fault.

924
01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:15.436
I pushed you too far. Too fast.

925
01:00:15.502 --> 01:00:17.738
We'll go
a little slower tonight.


926
01:00:17.805 --> 01:00:21.074
<i>Tonight? But, can't we...</i>

927
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:22.342
Tomorrow, then.

928
01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:25.212
And no more excuses.

929
01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:33.654
How did you get this?

930
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.989
While you were blundering
into the H.I.V.E. Queen's trap,


931
01:00:36.056 --> 01:00:39.460
I was hacking
into their servers.


932
01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:42.463
[Slade] Jericho.
That's what she called Joseph.


933
01:01:01.883 --> 01:01:03.083
[muffled screams]

934
01:01:09.456 --> 01:01:12.292
They're turning our son
into a weapon of war.


935
01:01:12.359 --> 01:01:15.562
Remember what she said?
I'm a handgun, but Joseph's...


936
01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:16.931
A nuclear bomb.

937
01:01:16.997 --> 01:01:18.833
But not in the way you think.

938
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.904
Those exercises are to help him
master his abilities, focus them.


939
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.071
But the goal?

940
01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:27.241
A revolution from within.

941
01:01:27.307 --> 01:01:29.443
Imagine if you
controlled someone


942
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:31.311
who could control
the minds of others.


943
01:01:31.378 --> 01:01:35.950
Presidents, prime ministers,
despots, kings.


944
01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:37.852
Mind-theft on a global scale.

945
01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:41.522
You could reshape the planet
without firing a single shot.


946
01:01:41.588 --> 01:01:46.093
And we've got ten days to figure
out what their first move is.


947
01:01:46.159 --> 01:01:48.128
[Slade] And it's all
because of her.


948
01:01:48.195 --> 01:01:50.797
She used Joseph.
Manipulated him.


949
01:01:54.334 --> 01:01:56.103
<i>You can do this.</i>

950
01:01:57.771 --> 01:01:59.673
<i>I know you're scared, Jericho,</i>

951
01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.375
<i>but I believe in you.</i>

952
01:02:01.441 --> 01:02:03.810
<i>As long as we have
each other, little brother,</i>


953
01:02:03.878 --> 01:02:06.981
<i>there's nothing
we can't accomplish.</i>


954
01:02:07.047 --> 01:02:09.249
<i>We're two parts of a whole.</i>

955
01:02:09.316 --> 01:02:11.151
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

956
01:02:11.218 --> 01:02:13.787
<i>Never abandon you
the way they did.</i>


957
01:02:15.222 --> 01:02:17.124
<i>We're family.</i>

958
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:25.065
Is that manipulation
or love?


959
01:02:30.237 --> 01:02:33.106
Thanks, Addie.
I'll take it from here.


960
01:02:33.173 --> 01:02:34.575
The hell you will!

961
01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:37.311
You don't get to decide
what I do or don't do.


962
01:02:37.377 --> 01:02:39.914
[Slade] You've risked enough.
This is my job.


963
01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:42.716
I lived with risk every
damn day we were married,


964
01:02:42.783 --> 01:02:46.653
only, I never knew it,
did I, Deathstroke?


965
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.855
You never told me.

966
01:02:47.922 --> 01:02:50.223
Please, can we stop
dredging up the past?


967
01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:52.326
You know there's something else
you never told me.


968
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.428
Why?

969
01:02:54.494 --> 01:02:57.698
Why did you choose
Deathstroke over us?


970
01:02:57.764 --> 01:02:59.968
A life of deceit and risk,
instead of...


971
01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:02.569
I didn't choose to be
one over the other, Addie.


972
01:03:02.636 --> 01:03:04.204
And I didn't
choose to be this.

There's always a choice.

974
01:03:05.706 --> 01:03:08.208
Those bastards
made me this way


975
01:03:08.275 --> 01:03:10.078
with their
damned experiment.


976
01:03:10.143 --> 01:03:11.846
And I did the best
I could with it.


977
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:14.114
[scoffs] That was your best?

978
01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:16.617
A mercenary? A murderer?

979
01:03:17.451 --> 01:03:19.020
My father was a soldier.

980
01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.354
His father was a soldier.

981
01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.123
All I knew
was the military life.


982
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.725
So I took
that training and...


983
01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:27.095
Corrupted it. Spit on it.

984
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.063
This world is filled with evil.

985
01:03:29.129 --> 01:03:31.565
On a scale
you can't comprehend.


986
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.202
Oh, I have some idea.

987
01:03:35.268 --> 01:03:39.806
Then you should understand that I just
did what we did when we served together.


988
01:03:39.874 --> 01:03:41.308
Took down the bad guys.

989
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:43.610
Don't you dare compare the two.

990
01:03:50.817 --> 01:03:51.953
I...

991
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.055
I tried to be the knight
Joseph believed I was.


992
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.124
[laughs scornfully] A knight?

993
01:03:56.189 --> 01:03:58.358
Is that what
you think you are?


994
01:03:58.425 --> 01:04:02.096
Oh, my God, Slade,
are you that delusional?


995
01:04:02.162 --> 01:04:04.231
Joseph didn't need a knight.

996
01:04:04.297 --> 01:04:05.799
He needed a father.

997
01:04:05.867 --> 01:04:07.734
I needed a husband.

998
01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:12.773
What's so wrong inside you that
you preferred Deathstroke to us?


999
01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:15.308
My life as Deathstroke,

1000
01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.277
it was separate
from my life with you.


1001
01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:18.980
It had nothing
to do with...


1002
01:04:19.047 --> 01:04:20.480
You really don't see it?

1003
01:04:20.547 --> 01:04:23.350
All these years
you've been compartmentalizing.


1004
01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:26.253
Filing pieces of yourself
away in little boxes.


1005
01:04:26.319 --> 01:04:28.856
Lying to yourself.
And to me.

[Wintergreen clears throat]
Thank you.

[both] For what?

1008
01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:39.666
For reminding me why I've chosen to
remain a bachelor all these years.


1009
01:04:39.733 --> 01:04:44.072
Now, are you two going to spend
the day at each other's throats,


1010
01:04:44.138 --> 01:04:47.541
or are we going to save Joseph,
and perhaps the world?

It's for your safety.

Until we know the full

And the commander-in-chief

Eerie, isn't it?

The entire country is in chaos.

And all of this for what?

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.138
Vengeance?
A righteous killing?


1073
01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:08.342
You manipulated me from the first
moment you stepped into my life.

Did you think I didn't know
what you were even then?

You used a lonely,
grief-stricken girl.

But I wasn't as alone
as you believed.

I had my brother, in here.

Long before I ever
told you about him.

And I knew what you did to him.

I made you a queen.

H.I.V.E. won't use us again.

No one will ever use us,

threw away?

Or the boy

Spare me the litany

[Slade] <i>"The land was filled
with dragons,</i>


1289
01:24:34.962 --> 01:24:37.731
<i>and the people were afraid.</i>

1290
01:24:37.797 --> 01:24:40.600
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>


1291
01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:43.938
<i>to protect both
man and maid.</i>


1292
01:24:44.005 --> 01:24:46.040
<i>He faced
the fiercest creatures</i>


1293
01:24:46.107 --> 01:24:47.942
<i>that the world had ever known.</i>

1294
01:24:49.743 --> 01:24:51.913
<i>And he did it all to save us.</i>

1295
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.149
<i>For the Knight was not alone.</i>

1296
01:24:56.516 --> 01:24:58.551
<i>And when his work was done,</i>

1297
01:24:59.854 --> 01:25:01.822
<i>the dragons were no more.</i>

1298
01:25:02.924 --> 01:25:05.458
<i>And so the Knight rode on</i>

1299
01:25:06.426 --> 01:25:08.095
<i>into legend,</i>

1300
01:25:08.162 --> 01:25:09.997
<i>into lore."</i>
