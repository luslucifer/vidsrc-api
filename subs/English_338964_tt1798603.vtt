<i>Let's just say my whole life</i>

30
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.086
<i>has been one long fucking</i>

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.605
<i>And pure shit on a good day.</i>

32
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.044
Goddamn it.

33
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.168
<i>Yeah, I guess there have been</i>

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.240
Fuck it.

35
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.003
<i>Like a piece of ass</i>
<i>who didn't look me in the eye</i>


36
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.730
<i>or wanna show me pictures</i>
<i>of her fucking vacation.</i>


37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.201
<i>Or a good drunk</i>
<i>when I didn't choke on my own vomit.</i>


38
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.850
- Ah!
<i>- I even almost had a friend once.</i>


39
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.445
<i>Sure, he was a mouth-breathing,</i>
<i>snot dripping 8-year-old</i>


40
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.761
<i>who couldn't find his fat ass</i>
<i>with both hands,</i>


41
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.364
<i>but he was clueless enough to think</i>

42
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.080
<i>I wasn't the worthless piece of shit</i>
<i>everybody else thinks I am.</i>


43
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.485
<i>Including me.</i>

44
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.687
<i>I also found what was the closest thing</i>
<i>I ever had to an actual girlfriend.</i>


45
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.481
<i>She liked the job I had at the time,</i>
<i>especially while I was in uniform.</i>


46
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.404
<i>Sounds like a happy ending, don't it?</i>

47
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.526
<i>But, you see...</i>

48
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.045
<i>...you can only puke in somebody's lap</i>
<i>so many times</i>


49
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.361
<i>before the romance takes a shit.</i>

50
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.967
<i>And the kid,</i>
<i>he still creeps around every now and then</i>


51
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.484
<i>and I still chase him off.</i>

52
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.323
<i>For his own good.</i>

53
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.721
<i>So you see, happy endings are bullshit.</i>

54
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.644
<i>Actually, there aren't such things</i>
<i>as endings at all,</i>


55
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.528
<i>because when some shit gets over with,</i>

56
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.569
<i>some other whole thing starts</i>
<i>that sucks ass.</i>

73
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.366
Willie?

74
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.967
Willie? It's me, Thurman.

75
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.442
Willie, what are you doing?
Did you get yourself stuck up there?


76
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.210
Okay, I'll go. But this package
came to my house for you, Willie.


77
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.930
There's a lot of money
in it. And a phone.

78
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.080
And a note.

79
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.200
What? Chair!

80
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.567
- Chair?
- Chair!


81
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.320
Chair.

82
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.450
Give me the goddamn chair.

83
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.841
Willie, you fell.

84
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.804
Goddamn. Are you
a complete fucking retard?


85
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.804
No. The Hungry Hoagies people tested me.
I'm top of the spectrum.


86
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.041
So they made me
a full-time sandwich consultant.


87
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.646
- Well, I'm glad you followed your passion.
- What's that smell?


88
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.249
Is the oven on?
Are you making Hot Pockets?


89
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.447
We do hot sandwiches
at Hungry Hoagies now.


90
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.761
But I always burn my hand
getting them out of oven.


91
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.082
Darlene says I should put butter
on my hand, but that's stupid.


92
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.322
We only put butter on food.
Hand isn't food.


93
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.884
<i># Merry Merry Christmas #</i>

96
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.481
I know we left on bad terms.

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.165
But you gotta understand,
it was only business.


98
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.479
We were partners.

99
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.130
And I broke that sacred bond.
It's not an excuse.


100
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.088
But Lois got all up in my kitchen.

101
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.846
Crazy bitch had me all turned around
with her magical Laotian pussy.


102
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.083
- Don't blame it on the snapper.
- I was pussy-blind. I'm ashamed.


103
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.208
You tried to murder me, you little prick.
Remember that?


104
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.486
And not with some little nubbin-dick gun,

105
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.801
but with adult man-sized bullets.

106
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.520
- And now I'm here to make it up to you.
- Why are you even out of the joint anyway?


107
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.126
Some pity case
on account of you're a genetic defect?


108
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.805
You know, they used to
sterilize guys like you.


109
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.883
Keep the world from becoming
some Negro Land of Oz.


110
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.162
Shut the fuck up!
Early release. Overcrowding.


111
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.128
Well, it must've been packed to the gills

112
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.725
if they couldn't cram
your three-foot ass in there.


113
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.810
We got a job, Willie. That two grand
is just to show I'm serious.


114
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.165
Can you still crack a safe?

115
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.481
Or did you get carpal tunnel
from jacking off?


116
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.445
- I can crack just fine, thanks.
- I'm talking millions this time.


117
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.682
- Where at?
- Chi-Town.


118
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.682
I thought you were all done
with the gooks.


119
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.364
Chicago, you racist moron fuck!

120
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.363
I got an associate out there
who has got this thing all lined up.


121
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.568
- What associate?
- I'm not at liberty to disclose just yet.


122
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.209
But they know your work.

123
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.204
And they want to bring us in and put us up
in some fine-ass metropolitan digs


124
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.770
and finance the whole operation.

125
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.448
You're outta your fucking skull.

126
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.647
What are you gonna do?
Try and kill yourself again?


127
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.040
That's none of your
goddamn business what I do.


128
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.008
Don't let the door
hit you in the ass.

129
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.924
Or I won't let it hit me in the ass.
Whatever the fuck it is.


130
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.241
Did you even score
once while I was away?

131
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.961
I'm talking two mil here.

132
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.485
That's a lot of fat-ass bitches
and whiskey.


133
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.445
Fuck you.

134
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.090
Why do you have to go so soon?
We just got back together.


135
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.162
Cut that shit out.
We're not back together.


136
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.565
Guess you don't know what today is.

137
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.722
I don't even know
what fucking year it is, kid.


138
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.688
It's my birthday.

139
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.205
- Today is your fucking birthday?
- Uh-huh.


140
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.361
I'm 21. Officially a man.

141
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.330
Goddamn. You're 21 already. 
That's creepy.

142
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.562
- Are you still gonna pop my cherry?
- Am I gonna what?


143
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.885
No! Fuck no!

144
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.484
But you said that when I was 21
that you'd pop my cherry.


145
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.483
I said I'd get
it done by somebody else.

146
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.200
Besides that, I'm a fucking guy.
You didn't turn funny, did you?


147
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.603
Am I funny?

148
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.606
So you haven't done it with anybody yet.

149
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.967
Not a man or a woman
or an animal or anything.


150
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.689
No, I waited for you.

151
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.526
- But surely, you jerked off or...
- You mean masturbate, don't you?


152
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.330
Well, if you wanna be scientific,
yeah, I guess so.


153
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.766
My friend Ronnie says, it's when you play
with your wiener and think about your mother.


154
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.244
I did it once, but it felt weird.

155
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.562
She's in heaven with God,
you know. Watching me.


156
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.283
Okay, so here's how it's gonna go down.
He's already asked me where his cherry is.


157
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.805
So you could tell him
to put his dick in your purse


158
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.847
and he wouldn't know
any fucking difference.


159
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.001
It's gonna be the easiest 20 bucks
you ever made.


160
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.764
Twenty bucks?

161
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.842
You must be high
on some strong shit, Willie.


162
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.241
A hundred. Or I'm gonna carry my ass
outta this old piece of a room right now.


163
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.765
All right.
Fifty, or I'll just go get your mother.


164
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.960
Sixty.

165
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.760
All right.

166
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.445
And nothing up my ass.
You done took all that, Willie.


167
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.566
Okay.

168
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.563
Well, let's get to it.
I gotta pick up my grandson from ballet.


169
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.040
- Can I fix you a sandwich?
- No.


170
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.964
- I got your sandwich, baby.
- Willie, I made you a sandwich.


171
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.963
I ain't sticking around.
Just give it to Opal after.


172
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.530
Now, listen, here's how it works.

173
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.802
She's gonna pull her rig off.
And she's gonna get on all fours.


174
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.122
Now, you stand behind her
and drop your rig.


175
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.965
Then, you're gonna see something that
looks like some kind of Japanese food.


176
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.122
It ain't, so don't eat it.
That's the bulls-eye.


177
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.890
Then you just start tugging
on your little soldier.


178
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.530
Wait till he gets to attention,
then poke him in there.


179
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.170
Keep poking it in
there till he spits up.

180
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.400
You're gonna need a raincoat.

181
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.846
She'll have one,
so don't worry about that.


182
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.361
As soon as you're done,
run to the bathroom, wash your crotch.


183
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.807
That way, you don't wake up wondering
why you got oatmeal in your carpet.


184
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.325
Breathe through your mouth
so that you don't puke.


185
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.006
Shouldn't be a problem for you.
You got it?


186
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.525
- You got 60 bucks?
- No.


187
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.448
- What you got?
- I have $20.


188
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.890
Keep it down.

189
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.286
- I have 20.
- Give it to her after.


190
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.007
- Later, Opal.
- Mm-hmm.


191
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.809
Come on, baby. Come on.

192
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.088
Get a bite of this pumpernickel bread.

193
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.725
Damn it, Willie. Hurry up!
We're gonna miss our train.


194
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.166
You see me walking backwards, asshole?
I'm coming.


195
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.565
Kid, get over here
and take your pants off.


196
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.403
No!

197
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.805
Ah, fuck.

198
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.281
<i># Sleigh bells ring</i>
<i>Are you listening? #</i>


199
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.159
<i># In the lane snow is glistening #</i>

200
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.449
<i># A beautiful sight</i>
<i>We're happy tonight #</i>


201
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.642
<i># Walking in a winter wonderland #</i>

202
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:22.364
<i># Gone away is the bluebird</i>
<i>In his place is a new bird #</i>


203
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.362
Here's your ID.

204
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.362
- "Randall Cook"?
- What the fuck wrong with that?


205
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.646
Randall sounds Irish.
I want something whiter.


206
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.723
I'm Davis, you're Cook.
End of fucking story.


207
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.723
You got one job
this time. Open a safe.

208
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.565
Till then, just keep your drunken
deviant fucking mouth shut.


209
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.206
You know what you need?
You need some pussy.


210
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.680
I'll see if I can find you
a cat somewhere.


211
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.409
Put that shit away.

212
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.810
"Giving City Foundation.

213
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.450
Bringing food and shelter
to those in need."


214
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.045
Hold the fucking phone.

215
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.840
I traveled all the way across the country
to rob a goddamn charity?


216
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.569
Why? You got a problem with that?

217
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.721
Yeah, you damn right
I got a problem with it.


218
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.687
No way these assholes
have 2 million bucks.


219
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.410
Will you keep it down, man. Moron.

220
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.326
I don't know.

221
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.406
- I see they made you some chairs already.
- Fuck you.


222
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.164
He's Cook. I'm Davis.
We're here for the orientation.


223
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.288
Empty your pockets.
Place any metal items in the tray.


224
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.326
What's that?

225
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.402
- Cough medicine.
- Let me see that.


226
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.407
That's a level three contraband.
I'm gonna have to compensate that.


227
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.004
The fuck you are.

228
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.925
All right, big shot.
You can stay out here with your GD flask.


229
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.048
- We'll get it on the way out.
- Gina!


230
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.962
Show these boys to the line-up.
They're late.


231
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.406
Meeting started ten minutes ago.

232
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.880
But I think I can sneak you guys in.
Come on.


233
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.165
- Hey, Diane! I got two more.
- Come on in, fellas.


234
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.719
- Goddamn.
- That's Diane Hastings.


235
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.290
She and her husband run the joint.

236
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.601
So like I was saying,
finish filling out these forms


237
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.489
and you can drop them off
at the front desk, please.


238
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.369
And then, you can go to the common room
and pick up your uniforms.


239
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.204
I bet that pussy got lips
like an orangutan.


240
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.890
- Excuse me, Mr...
- Um, Cook. Randall Cook.


241
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.849
- What's up?
- Have you been drinking?


242
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.610
Uh, I don't know. Some vodka...

243
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.888
Because we don't allow alcohol
or drugs of any kind at Giving City.


244
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.040
Why's that?

245
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.522
You may not be aware of this, Mr. Cook,
but we're a charity.


246
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.567
When you walk out those doors,
you're representing us.


247
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.564
- So please try and make us look good.
- Oh, we'll make you look great.


248
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.721
- Promise.
- Yeah.


249
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.285
Mmm.

250
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:21.800
A hard-on?

251
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.244
You sick fuck.

252
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.367
I'm the one that's been in prison
for ten years.


253
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.885
It's just a semi.
Don't get all bent out of shape.


254
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.529
Shut the fuck up.

255
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.408
Ho, ho, ho. What's up, Santas?

256
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.890
Hey, don't forget to remind people,

257
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.360
if they don't have cash,
they can always text in their donation.


258
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.487
Give me some. Yeah.

259
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.806
Hey, Di. Is it the midget
that's fully proportional?


260
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.324
- Or is it the dwarf?
- Regent.


261
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.526
- What?
- You can't say that word.


262
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.602
Hey, I'm gonna be home late again tonight.

263
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.647
End-of-the-year accounting stuff.

264
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.449
See you, babe.

265
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.889
Thank you for helping us out again.

266
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.802
Goddamn it.

267
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.529
Sir? This way, please.

268
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
Don't be touching me.


269
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.479
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, whatever.


270
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.890
Lying little fuck.

271
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.485
You didn't tell me I'd have to get
in the fucking suit again.


272
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.405
I thought it would be a bonus.
And I just wanna remind you of something.


273
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.847
It's Christmas.
A time for forgiveness. For family.


274
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.683
I'm gonna remind you to fuck yourself.

275
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.484
Ronald Davis.
I was told you have a suit to fit me.


276
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.563
Oh, yes. I have it right here.

277
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.570
No. I need a Santa suit.
This is an elf suit.


278
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.243
I'm supposed to be a Santa.

279
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.880
Oh, sorry about the confusion.
That's all we have in your size.


280
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:35.319
Uh, I do have a gingerbread man costume
in a child's large, if you prefer.


281
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.890
I guess there is a God.

282
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.848
Step right up. Don't be shy.

283
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.970
Shitstick! What's it been?
Fifteen years? Twen...


284
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.530
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
You still hit like your fucking father.


285
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.160
Fucking <i>associate.</i> No goddamn way.

286
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.722
Not working with that poison bitch.
Never again.


287
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.927
You tricked me, you little shithole!

288
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.205
You know fucking well you did.

289
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.521
But I thought your dad
was the one you hated.


290
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.126
I hate him more than anything
in the goddamn world! Except her.


291
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.808
Willie, stop! Willie!

292
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.849
Okay, shitstick, just give me back
the money for the train ticket,


293
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.000
then we're square.

294
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.970
Or you could do your dumbass self a favor,
at least hear me out before you quit.


295
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.530
Boy, you been selling
your blood for booze?


296
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.240
You look like a fucking albino scarecrow.

297
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.687
Anyway, still good to see you.

298
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.961
Uh, I can't say I feel the same.

299
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.445
Goddamn, what a shit hole.

300
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.250
- You conned me, you little prick.
- Fuck you!


301
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.209
Make yourselves at home. 
Bedroom's mine.

302
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.045
That sofa folds out,
so you guys can fight over that.


303
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.962
I got chicken feet in the fridge.

304
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.770
- So that's what smells like nut sack.
- Boy, have a beer.


305
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.726
- I even got minis for the midget.
- Don't you ever fucking call me that.


306
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.360
Hey, listen, little man,
I don't speak politically correct,


307
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.841
so if you got a problem with that,
you take it up with the Lollipop Guild.


308
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.520
Shut the hell up!
Just break it down for him, Sunny.


309
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.920
I'll break it down, all right.

310
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.208
Giving City is a charity
at 98 cents every dollar


311
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.122
goes to this A-hole at the top.

312
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.724
Regent Hastings.

313
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.882
He takes in tens of thousands
in donations,


314
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.530
and he squirrels them away
in an offshore account.


315
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.048
- And how are you supposed to get it?
- You mean, how are we supposed to get it?


316
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.522
These little buckets here,
they're filled with cash,


317
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.124
up to the brim, every day.

318
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.642
And then at night, they store that cash
in the safe in Regent's office.


319
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.928
And that's our target. Right here.

320
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.360
Christmas Eve,
they have a big charity concert.


321
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.601
So while the kids and volunteers
are all singing,


322
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.842
the money's just sitting there,
waiting for an armored transfer.


323
00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.322
That's our take window.
Last year, the haul was almost 2 mil.


324
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.767
- And how do you know all this shit?
- Because I work there, dumbass.


325
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.410
It's a part of my release from the joint.
I've been there 3 months.


326
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.766
Just did a little digging,
a little Googling,


327
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.002
a dry hand job to Isaac
in Accounting. Boom.


328
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.002
The concert's in five days.

329
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.924
Meantime, we wear the suit,
hit the pavement,


330
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.081
we ring the bell,
just like the rest of the volunteers.


331
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.445
All right.

332
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.967
Well, it looks to me like you jackals
already got the whole job figured out.


333
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.849
What do you need me for?
You can crack a fucking safe.


334
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.039
Well, I'd like to say
it's because I've missed you, my angel.


335
00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.567
But I got a touch of the Parkinson's
and my hearing ain't what it used to be,


336
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.482
so I'm gonna need you on the safe.

337
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.687
Mmm.

338
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.320
And when do you pull your little
Roy Rogers pistol out on me again?


339
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.448
I said I was sorry.
You gotta let that shit go, Willie!


340
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.442
No, I think I'll hang on to it.

341
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.089
Oh, Christ.

342
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.765
If I cut ties with every numbnut
who tried to shoot me,


343
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:51.967
I never would've gotten pregnant with you.

344
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.724
Come on, boy. Be just like old times.

345
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.449
- Old times?
- Mm-hmm.


346
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.001
You mean a living fucking nightmare?
Why didn't you say so? I'm in.


347
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.405
You gotta be shitting me.
Good luck with the shakes.


348
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.450
Willie, come on. 
Just give it a chance.

349
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.445
What, you don't trust your mother?

350
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.920
Yeah, I trust her
about as far as I can throw you.


351
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.320
And I trust you
about as far as I can throw her.


352
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.049
Come on, Willie, I need this.

353
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.680
And I know your sorry ass does too.
Look at you, man.


354
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.929
Okay, if you want me in on this,
it's you and me against her.


355
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.444
You got it?

356
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.967
She don't get a fucking nickel
of what's in that safe. Get me?


357
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.646
- We'll cut her out after the grab.
- Damn right.


358
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.567
I knew you couldn't stay away.
You always were your mama's boy.


359
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.245
You just pipe down
about the family stuff, okay?


360
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.640
I'm in this for the dough, period.
You get me?


361
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.450
Well, it's starting to feel
like Christmas.


362
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.166
Spare some change.

363
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.049
Think about somebody
besides your fucking selves.


364
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.770
We gotta get eyes on that safe.
Need to know the make.


365
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.410
Now you're asking
the right questions, shitstick.


366
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.527
The trash chute's the best way in.

367
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.283
I'm gonna need a hand
getting into position.


368
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.044
Recon. Good. We'll go tonight.

369
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.361
Look at those cheeks!

370
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.399
That's the ugliest fucking baby
on the planet.


371
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.130
I guess the abortion didn't take.

372
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.602
Well, bless your heart.
Cheap little fucker.


373
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.647
Fucking dimes? 
Are you shitting me?

374
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.763
- This ain't no strip joint.
- What a fucking Sokes family.


375
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.445
This is what happens
when you screw your cousins.


376
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.641
I taught this muskrat everything he knows.

377
00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.519
- Well, you don't know shit, then, do you?
- Hey, listen, before we had midget...


378
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.443
Excuse me... little people, we had Willie.

379
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.762
He was my original elf.
Remember those times, Willie?


380
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.126
There ain't enough booze to forget it.

381
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.448
Well, he'd get panic attacks.
It was embarrassing.


382
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.285
I had to make him stay outside
when I was turning a trick or bowling.


383
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.204
Wait a fucking minute,
you were embarrassed?


384
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.442
Isn't that kind of like the pot
calling the other cot a fuck kettle,


385
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.249
- or whatever it was?
- What the fuck you say?


386
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.686
He's home-schooled.

387
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.484
I need a refill.

388
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.280
- And another fucking corner.
- Stop it, Willie.


389
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.124
What? We're gonna steal this shit
any fucking way. Who cares?


390
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.009
But if we get fired,
we got no access to the building.


391
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.242
And if we got no access to the building,
we got no access to the safe.


392
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.043
And if we got
no access to the safe,

393
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.568
there's no reason for me to be standing
out here, freezing my fucking nuts off.


394
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.084
You mean your nuts
haven't been scraped off


395
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.679
because they're so low
to the ground already?


396
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.727
You know every time you're passed out,

397
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.200
I lay them on your forehead
and take a picture of it.


398
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.362
I got a whole Instagram of that shit
of me tea-bagging you.


399
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.966
Four thousand followers and counting,
motherfucker. Ha-ha!


400
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.561
Well, knock yourselves out.
I'm getting the fuck out of here.


401
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.846
Aw, come on,
we're having family time here.


402
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.844
He's always been too goddamn soft.
Probably because he was born early.


403
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.480
Hell, I didn't even know
I'd given birth until I tripped over him.


404
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.967
- Hello.
- Hi, Willie.


405
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.609
Kid, how'd you get my number?

406
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.010
<i>The cherry pop lady gave it to me.</i>

407
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.080
Oh, Jesus.

408
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.884
I cleaned your apartment, Willie.
And I fed your insects.


409
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.450
They're getting really big.

410
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.010
<i>Do you want me to get you</i>
<i>a Christmas tree?</i>


411
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.407
- What? Why would I want a tree?
- So we can spend Christmas together.


412
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.129
<i>I'm in fucking Chicago, kid.</i>

413
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.609
So you're not coming back for Christmas?

414
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.889
- No, I'm not coming home for Christmas.
- Chicago's in the Midwest, Willie.


415
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.484
<i>They have Hungry Hoagies there too.</i>

416
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.687
Well, good.
I'll tell them you said hello, okay?


417
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.887
Except I don't know anyone
at that Hungry Hoagies.


418
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.166
All right, listen, you gotta quit
fucking calling me, okay?


419
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.810
- You're burning my minutes.
- But what if it's an emergency?


420
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.007
Fine! If it's an emergency,
call me, all right?


421
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.127
Otherwise, leave me the fuck alone, okay?

422
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.247
Okay. I'll only call if it's an emergency.

423
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.449
Bye.

424
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:19.481
<i># It's the most wonderful time</i>
<i>of the year #</i>


425
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.166
Okay, feed the kids.
Come on. Give it up.

426
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.401
You've seen them babies with beer bellies.

427
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.370
Ho, ho! Come on, you got Jesus
and the lambikins watching over you,


428
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.362
checking their list twice.

429
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.646
Here you go, lady,
how about a little money?


430
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.807
You know what,
you'd better hope the orphans don't riot.


431
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.768
They'll eat your fat ass
right off the bat.


432
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.888
You know, a lot of these kids
don't got any arms and legs and shit.


433
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.768
You're lucky. See, ma'am?
Yours got all their parts.


434
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.002
- There you go.
- There you go. Thank you. See you later.


435
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.809
- Damn. Mama ain't bad.
- Whoa!


436
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.769
Whoa-ho-ho! My spot.

437
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.529
You are standing on my spot.

438
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.205
Really? That's funny, I don't see
your fucking name on it anywhere.


439
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.486
Well, in fairness,
I did leave it unattended,


440
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.881
but that's only because
I had to run off to the little boys' room.


441
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.848
What are you,
a fucking game show host or something?


442
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.445
- Dial it back a notch.
- But now I am back.


443
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.965
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

444
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.167
'Tis the season of giving!

445
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.961
And if you don't have cash,
you can always text XMAS 999...


446
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.327
Bullshit. No fucking way.
Fucking cash only.


447
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.764
- Ten dollars or more.
- Okay.


448
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.330
Hundreds are better. What?

449
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.084
I am going to have to ask you
to watch your language


450
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.809
when you're representing the suit.

451
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.769
And I'm going to have to ask you
to suck my fucking dick.


452
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:30.920
I'm warning you.

453
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:35.687
Nothing and no one is getting in the way
of me spreading my joy!


454
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.965
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

455
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.246
You know what,
I think you're some kind of pervert


456
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.323
and you're afraid I'm muscling in
on your fucking fondle territory.


457
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.324
- That's what I think.
- I see what's going on here. Yes, I see.


458
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.208
- You are hurting inside.
- Is that right?


459
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.327
And there's only one thing
that can change that.


460
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.367
- Yeah? What's that?
- A hug.


461
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.487
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- A hug from Santa!


462
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.289
No, I don't need
no fucking hug from Santa.


463
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.760
- Let go of me, motherfucker.
- Melt all that stress away!


464
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.204
Would you cool it, pal?

465
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.247
You're scaring all the kids away.
You know what I mean?


466
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.640
You are a fucking pedophile!

467
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.483
- Let go of me.
- Aw!


468
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.527
Fuck!

469
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.603
- Ooh!
- Fucking asshole!


470
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.330
Fucking shit.

471
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.242
Fucking asshole.

472
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.323
This guy's a pedophiliac, here,
and he's after all your kids.


473
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.129
You better get out of here.

474
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:28.046
You fucking perverted fucking asshole!

475
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.249
What the fuck? 
Hang on a second.

476
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.687
He's the fucking kid diddler, not me.
I'm a hero!


477
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.126
- Sure you won't die up there?
- I've done smaller spaces, trust me.


478
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:47.966
Well, if you don't make it, son,
I got a cigar box, make a nice casket.


479
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.769
Who you calling "son"?

480
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.524
Well, I'm proud to say that my pussy
is color-blind, so you never know.


481
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.086
Oh!

482
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.969
Whoa! You go, little sperm.
Get up in there.


483
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.006
Well, you don't see
something like that every day.


484
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.606
Ow! Bottles! Recycle that shit!

485
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:23.207
Oh! What the fuck
is tha... Oh, shit! No!

486
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.890
Hey.

487
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.684
I always wanted to fuck me a Santa.

488
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.729
Well, I always wanted to shit
on a tattooed dick


489
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.642
so we're perfect for each other.

490
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.890
- Cook, let's go.
- See you in my dreams, chief.


491
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.810
Thank you.

492
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.281
You're not the first volunteer
to go off the rails.


493
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.124
Lucky for you, Giving City
has a high standing in the community,


494
00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.485
so you won't get charged.

495
00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.967
You can turn in your suit
when you clean yourself up.


496
00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.281
Now, hang on a second. 
You're firing me?

497
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.646
I rooted out a pervert.

498
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.961
You should be throwing me
a fucking parade.


499
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.122
And we're very grateful.
But you reek of whiskey.


500
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.281
You know the rules
and you're flouting them.


501
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.599
Flouting?

502
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.650
I never sucked jizz out of nobody's ass.
I mean, with a straw.


503
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.961
I believe that's felching.

504
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.848
Not that I would know.

505
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:30.528
Uh, happy holidays, Mr. Cook.
Consider your freedom a gift from me.


506
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:36.359
Well, hang on a second. Hang on!
I only had one drink.


507
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.761
And that was just to keep warm out there.
I'm freezing my nuts off.


508
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.928
And if we're being honest here,
you, you guys should be supplying us


509
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.320
with some kind of electric underwear
or some shit.


510
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:50.724
Oh, well, if we're being honest,
I don't like being lied to.


511
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.963
- Please. I need this.
- Why do you care so much?


512
00:27:55.050 --> 00:28:00.000
Why do I care? 
Why do I care.

513
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.530
I'll tell you why I care.
Because the world's a fucking shit hole.


514
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.603
But when I put this suit on,
I feel like...


515
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:13.128
Well, I feel like General MacArthur
must have felt when he put his uniform on


516
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.929
and went and killed all them Filipinos.

517
00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.963
Look, I, I put up with
a lot of shit from kids...


518
00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:24.047
For the kids.
I won't piss on the suit. I really won't.


519
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.362
I mean, give a broke-dick
motherfucker a chance, will you?


520
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.401
Fine. I'll give you a second chance.
If you give me a chance to help you.


521
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.410
All right.

522
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.449
How we looking, Alice?

523
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.004
Well, according to this report,

524
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.650
Giving City's gonna lose
a record amount of money this year.


525
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.404
Ugh, every time you say that,
my dick gets so hard.


526
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.164
- Okay.
- Hey, why don't we just do it right now.


527
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.650
- Come on.
- No.


528
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.608
I'll up your commission to five percent.

529
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.410
Make it ten, and I'll let you do
that thing with my shoe.


530
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.402
Both shoes. And you have to watch.

531
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.800
Deal.

532
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.047
- You can't smoke here, sir.
- So call the fucking law.


533
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.167
And while they're rolling
their fat asses down here,


534
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.049
I'll be smoking like an old Buick,
all right?


535
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.446
Arrested? Christ! William.

536
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.206
- Not arrested. I was detained.
- Yeah. Shot of gin.


537
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:02.610
What were you thinking?
You could have fucked this whole thing up.


538
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.488
- I handled it.
- Mmm.


539
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.607
Told her I'd go to
an AA meeting with her.

540
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:11.481
Don't buy their shit, William.
No such thing as an alcoholic.


541
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.969
Just a sign of a weak liver.

542
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.770
I said I fucking handled it.
What are you, deaf?


543
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.287
Well, you talk like you have a cock
in your mouth, shitstick.


544
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.160
Hey, you know why we call him "shitstick"?

545
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.769
Because even when he was a baby,
he tried to butt-fuck everything.


546
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.122
- Goddamn it.
- Stuffed monkey, neighbor's dog.


547
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.521
I'm telling you,
if it had a butt, he'd try to fuck it.


548
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.647
He's with his little nub, going.

549
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.366
Anyway, I think you ought to be working
the sexual angle with her,


550
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.801
because I know for a fact
that that husband isn't getting it done.


551
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.847
That guy never rocked
a clit in his life.

552
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.446
And that is one piece of motherly advice
I hope you took to heart.


553
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:56.365
You motorboat that O-button
till she's speaking in tongues.


554
00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.319
- You know what "son" means, right?
- When did you turn into such a pussy?


555
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.050
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- I'm not worried.


556
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.043
I just don't want you hacking up
your lung in my drink, okay?


557
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.965
Not a chance.
Nah, this chassis' built to last.


558
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.407
You know,
I smoked two packs of menthols a day,


559
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.607
washed it down with
a liter of this gin...

560
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.285
And I could still fill that shot glass
with this man's jizz.


561
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:32.130
- I said I don't give a shit, okay?
- Fine. I get it. You're mad at me.


562
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.044
You think I was really ready
to be a mom at 13?


563
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.009
Huh? We were gonna wait
at least another year.


564
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.520
I mean, the one time
your son of a bitch father


565
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.250
didn't put it in my ass,
I had to go and get pregnant.


566
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.721
- Shit happens.
- That's fucking beautiful.


567
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.530
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
I was a perfect mother.


568
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.600
Yeah, no shit.

569
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.320
You made me take the fall for you
when I was 11.


570
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.845
Well, there's no sense in us
both going down.


571
00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:01.721
Besides, it made a man of you.
You are who you are because of me.


572
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.120
No, I'm not anything like you.

573
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.886
Yeah?
Well, you keep telling yourself that.


574
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.724
Now where's your fucking midget?
It's getting late.


575
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.079
<i># Pop that pussy</i>
<i>Hey, pop that pussy, baby #</i>


576
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.850
What... What is that?

577
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:21.920
Shit!

578
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.400
What, do you have a speaker up there?

579
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.322
Dorfman, get up here.

580
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:32.168
You sure it was a phone ring?
Might have just been the fan turning over.


581
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.290
Well, Dorfman, last time I checked,
fans don't "Pop That Pussy."


582
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.601
No, I suppose they don't.

583
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.847
No, I think Diane hired someone
to spy on me.


584
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.048
- Diane? That doesn't sound like her.
- I want you to watch her.


585
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.009
Anything unusual, I wanna know about it.
And cover the whole building.


586
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.286
I'm talking microphones,
cameras, everything.


587
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.408
Copy. Ladies' room
is already taken care of.


588
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.127
He's fucking Alice.

589
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.089
- Go figure.
- Why the fuck would you call me?


590
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.281
Well, you're the genius
who left your ringer on.


591
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.761
Because you the only two people I know.
Why would you call?


592
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.161
- What's she doing
with that shoe? Oh, God!


593
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.004
He heard a noise in the fucking vent.
What's the big deal?


594
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.050
He heard "Pop That Pussy" in the vent,
and that is a big fucking deal.


595
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.280
Think she knows?

596
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.124
- Who?
- You know, the redheaded gal, Diane.


597
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.690
That her husband's
fooling around with the help?


598
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.002
I'm saying, do you think she knows
that her fucking husband


599
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.241
is ripping off the goddamn charity?

600
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.970
Who gives a shit?
As long as she doesn't get in the way.


601
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.600
- Can you crack the safe?
- Of course I can crack the fucking safe.


602
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.808
Probably take me about three minutes.
Three and a half tops.


603
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.883
Well, you shave a minute off that,
you may be good for something.


604
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.361
- What about the alarm system?
- It's a Centaur 2100.


605
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.887
We power it down,
we have ten minutes before it reboots.


606
00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.690
But I'm gonna need a key
to the electrical room to access it.


607
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.729
- It's the only way in.
- Ah, shit, how are we gonna get that?


608
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.450
Don't even think about it, Willie.

609
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.170
That big bitch is mine.

610
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.041
He should show you some respect.

611
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.248
- You're the talent, not him.
- Hey, Randall!


612
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.730
Mind giving me a hand over here?

613
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.449
I've gotta get this stuff
to the auditorium.


614
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.604
He'd love to, darling.
Strong, strapping man like him.


615
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.046
Clitoris, son. 
Do it for Mama.

616
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.530
Thanks, Sunny.

617
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.569
She's so sweet. I wish I had
a hundred volunteers like her.


618
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.802
Oh, yeah, she's something.
I'm sure they only made one of her.


619
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.044
How you doing, beautiful?

620
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:37.042
- Gina, was it?
- That's right.


621
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.000
- Ronald. We haven't officially met.
- Well, hello, Ronald. Officially.


622
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.686
I bet you got no idea
how beautiful you really are.


623
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.330
I don't know. I
think I've got some idea.

624
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:50.686
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Maybe a little.


625
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.763
I don't mean to be indiscreet,
but I do pretty well.


626
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.161
So if you can't bring your A game,
don't even try.


627
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.288
Sweetheart, I'm not sure
you could handle my A game.


628
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.839
You get one hit of me
and you'll be addicted.


629
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.527
- I like your confidence.
- I'd light you up like the Fourth of July.


630
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.126
Look, Ronald,
I'm just gonna cut to the chase here.


631
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.679
I am strictly first-class.

632
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:19.050
I'm talking Chrysler 300,
factory-direct, fully loaded.


633
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.123
And after that... lobster.

634
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.725
Now if you think you can handle that,

635
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.362
then maybe, just maybe,
I'll pencil you in.


636
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.407
Bye.

637
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:36.121
<i># Joy to the world,
the Lord is come #</i>

638
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.560
Aren't they great?

639
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.489
Regent likes to focus on the business,
but I'm like you.


640
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.846
I am all about those kids
and the Christmas concert.


641
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.603
We all participate.

642
00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.650
Volunteers, staff.
If you're interested, you could join us.


643
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.210
You outta your goddamn mind?

644
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.010
I ain't dancing around
with a bunch of candy canes and shit.


645
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.602
Because I'm all about
the birth of Christmas.


646
00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.603
You know, the wise guys

647
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:06.161
kicked him out of the hotel
and the ejaculate conception


648
00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.163
and the drummer that didn't have shit
to give him but some perfume...


649
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:14.166
And the King Midas or one of them
threatened to cut the kid in half,


650
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.924
turn him into gold and but, see, I...

651
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.720
It's a heavy deal for me.
Pretty damn heavy.


652
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.530
Are you talking about
the true meaning of Christmas?


653
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.204
- Exactly.
- Right.


654
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.441
Don't forget about the meeting
tomorrow night at 7:30.


655
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.570
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, it's only scary the first time.


656
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.122
- Does this bus go to Chicago?
- No.


657
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.805
Son, this bus goes
to the Arrowhead Premium Outlets.


658
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.842
- Is that close to Chicago?
- No.


659
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.047
Okay.

660
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.486
How do I look?

661
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.086
You look like one of those trolls
that gang-fucked Willy Wonka.


662
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.800
Good one, shitstick.

663
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.167
Hey, Shaft, you ready to stick it
to this chick tonight?


664
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.525
Bitch, let me tell you something.

665
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.843
When I was at the pen,
everyone called me tripod.


666
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.048
Well, if your legs are six inches long,

667
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.440
that's not that big
of a fucking deal, see.


668
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.250
Now, if you're six foot five
and they called you tripod,


669
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.845
then you're talking about something.

670
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.482
- Miserable fucks, both of you.
- Mm.


671
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:38.843
- Goddamn, did you eat your own shit?
- No, I've been eating caramels.


672
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.401
You know how caramels
make Mama belch. Remember?


673
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.607
No. No, I don't.

674
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.886
No, come on. You remember.

675
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.769
Look, when you were a baby,

676
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:54.288
I used to chew and feed you caramels,
just like a mama bird does.


677
00:37:54.370 --> 00:38:00.207
I'd chew and chew and chew
till they were all milky.


678
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.610
Goddamn.

679
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.888
And then I'd...
spit them right in your little mouth.


680
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.804
And you'd just,
you'd just squint your little...


681
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.281
Can't you see I'm trying to eat
a fucking pizza here?


682
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.166
I swear to God, a fucking electric oven.

683
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:53.169
Anyway, it took this new set of teeth
to finally see the light.


684
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.083
Jesus, I already need a fucking drink.

685
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.446
People ask me if
I miss my old teeth.

686
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:06.770
But sometimes, you have to
lose something to gain something.


687
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:14.521
Now, I'm dating again,
and I'm ready to find The One.


688
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.602
Thank you for that, Jason.

689
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.889
- With no teeth, he ought to try dudes.
- Terrible.


690
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.290
Would anyone else care to share?

691
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:25.970
Anyone?

692
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.600
The stage is yours.

693
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.924
- Hi, I'm Diane and I'm an alcoholic.
- Hi, Diane.


694
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.320
Maybe next time,
you'll feel comfortable speaking.


695
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.288
I don't know about that.

696
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.649
Okay. Fine.

697
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.199
Maybe you can just talk to me
if that's easier.


698
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.488
Do you ever feel
like you hit rock bottom?

699
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.770
You gotta be shitting me.

700
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.804
I sure did. In my late 20's.

701
00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.450
You know, some people
can have one drink and they're fine.


702
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.762
I am not that kind
of person. I get wild.

703
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.763
- I'm all ears. How wild?
- What?


704
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.570
You mean like sex stuff?
That kind of thing?


705
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.406
Yes.

706
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.085
Alcohol led me to make
some not-so-good choices.


707
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.241
But I've cleaned up my life.

708
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.845
- I met Regent...
- Wait a minute, hang on.


709
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.207
You picked that douche bag up
when you were sober?


710
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.725
He was different
when he was in the Peace Corps.


711
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.244
He helped me find focus.

712
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.882
You don't understand, it was bad.
Three-ways, five-ways...


713
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.088
Five-ways? How many holes do you have?

714
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.244
- Anyway, the drinking had to stop.
- Yeah, I guess so.


715
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.686
It was probably making you forget
all the fun you had.


716
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.086
I'm talking about addiction, Mr. Cook.

717
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.480
Like sex? Or booze?

718
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.648
Listen, I'll tell you what,

719
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.040
I'd like to get you in
that back seat there.


720
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.726
And tear your little panties off
and get that ass in my face


721
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:57.127
and just fuck that pussy
like you can't imagine.


722
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.085
Excuse me?

723
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.166
You filthy, dirty...

724
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.242
Well, I thought that's what
we were talking about here.


725
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.650
Get out of my car!

726
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.803
- Damn, no sweat.
- Unbelievable.


727
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.689
Goddamn.

728
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.807
- I'm trying to help you.
- Look, I'm sorry.


729
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.450
I fucking read you wrong. I was just...

730
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.640
Well, thank you, Ronald.

731
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.121
- That was some fine crustacean.
- Yeah.


732
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.327
Maybe we should take this upstairs.

733
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.049
- Hmm.
- What?


734
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.089
When it's right, it's right.
I feel it, you feel it?


735
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.288
- You're really fun, but just...
- I'm not tall enough for you?


736
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.963
- What?
- Go on and say it.


737
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:43.327
No! Your height has nothing to do with it.
I don't even see height.


738
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.641
What's the trouble, then, baby?

739
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.643
You're just not my type.
I'm into older guys.


740
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.440
You know, like, older Jewish guys,
older Irish guys, dads.


741
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.762
Not my dad, other people's dads.
They're the best.


742
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.319
You know, they're usually into anal.
But their wives won't give it up.


743
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:03.485
But I don't mind. I'm just into, you know,
more mature, experienced guys.


744
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.529
Guys who are well-traveled,
cultured and into butt stuff.


745
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.126
Bad boys, you know. Guys who don't
give a fuck and treat me like shit.


746
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:14.602
A guy who if I asked him to choke me,
would enjoy it just a little too much.


747
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.410
Damn, girl, I wouldn't pick you out
for that kind of shit.


748
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.005
Christmas in general gets me so drenched.

749
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.400
I mean, a guy breaks into your house,
eats your food


750
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.527
and then punishes you
because you were naughty.


751
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.040
I think I'm gonna go upstairs
and watch <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>


752
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.008
and rub one out right now.

753
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.568
But thanks for the lobster.

754
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.401
Ain't that but a bitch!

755
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.322
Done ate ten pounds of lobster

756
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.720
and I didn't even get a chance
to smell that pussy.


757
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.689
Damn. Shit.

758
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.883
Fine, get in.

759
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.605
Regent and I haven't had sex
in over a decade.


760
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.204
We stay together for the charity.

761
00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.842
I'm a good girl, Mr. Cook,
but sometimes I need to be bad.


762
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.320
Now get your filthy ass in the car.

763
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.209
See, that's what I thought.

764
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.327
Oh, yeah!

765
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.244
Fuck me like the dirty little slut
that I am.


766
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.162
Call me Santa.

767
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.242
- What?
- Call me Santa.


768
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.448
Don't be weird. 
Tell me how dirty this is.

769
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.409
- Call me Santa.
- Shut up.


770
00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.410
And spit on me.

771
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.560
Fuck!

772
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:33.609
- Tell me how dirty it is.
- Okay.


773
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.728
Uh, it's a dumpster in an alley.

774
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:38.961
It's pretty, pretty fucking dirty,
I guess.


775
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.964
- Tell me it's fucking dirty!
- Okay, it's fucking dirty.


776
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.922
It's dirty.

777
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.526
Yes, it's dirty.

778
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:56.124
- Oh, oh, fuck me. I'm so dirty.
- Yeah.


779
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:03.446
It was a one-time thing.
That never happened.


780
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.600
All right.

781
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.363
What the fuck?

782
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.601
I'm not missing <i>The Bachelor</i> finale.

783
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.400
I gotta see who the dingleberry
gives his last rose to,


784
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.130
Goiter Face or Drunk Slut.

785
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.330
Fuck! Oh! Get out of my brain!

786
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:33.120
- Hey, Homeo, you got the key?
- I'm gonna need a little more time.


787
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.840
Christ, am I the only one getting
anything done here tonight?


788
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.730
And I thought my family was fucked.

789
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.370
Is he always this fucking useless?

790
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.602
- <i>Ow!</i>
- Oh, call the medic!


791
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.969
<i># Frosty the Snowman</i>
<i>Was a jolly happy soul #</i>


792

<i>And two eyes made of out coal #</i>

796

<i># For Frosty the Snowman</i>
<i>Had to hurry on... #</i>


797
00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.681
- Do you know Willie?
- Willie? No.


798
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.480
- Who the hell is Willie?
- Can I ride the bicycle now?


799
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.401
Why the fuck were
they at an AA meeting?

800
00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.560
I don't know.

801
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.404
- Maybe he's an alcoholic.
- Brilliant insight, Dorfman.


802
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.288
No, I'm wondering why they were together.

803
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.320
I wanna know who he is.

804
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.482
Find out everything.
Schools, arrests, financials, meds.


805
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.721
Whatever's out there on this guy,
I wanna see it.


806
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.250
Copy.

807
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.243
Yeah, do I need to seduce that girl
myself to get that key?


808
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.799
Because I can. 
Wouldn't be the first time.

809
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.359
Please don't make me picture that.
I'm on it.


810
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.282
Well, you better be.

811
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.521
Or else I'll get her done.

812
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.569
I need full dossier on a Randall Cook.

813
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.487
Yes, I said "dossier."

814
00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.883
I'm sorry. I was under the impression
that was the correct nomenclature.


815
00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.324
"Nomenclature."

816
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.282
Fine! A file, then.

817
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.009
Asshole.

818
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.490
<i># Everybody shake your ungh #</i>

824
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.888
Shitstick! Let's go!
I got a side gig, just the two of us.


825
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.081
- I'm busy.
- I said get in the van.


826
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.480
I said I'm fucking busy!

827
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:53.007
One fucking thing I get to enjoy
and you shit on that too.


828
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:57.130
So I help field incoming calls
for the Santa appearances


829
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.442
and shows and whatnot,
so I snagged this one just for us.


830
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.329
Every year, these rich assholes throw
this huge party to benefit the needy kids.


831
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.244
And this year, they requested
Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus.


832
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.165
So, while you're playing Santa,
I'm gonna clean these buggers out.


833
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.445
Hang on a second here.

834
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.728
I'm gonna spend my whole day
with a bunch of damn kids on my lap?


835
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.325
- I'm retired from that shit anyway.
- Give me that.


836
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.367
Give me that, you fucking lush.

837
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:29.006
- I need you sharp.
- Goddamn it.

Seriously, you need to
give my bike back. Now.

Oh, Gina!

Oh, hey!

- You're not mad, are you?
- Mad? No. Because I get you.

refined taste...

853

- What's up, girl?
- Ooh. You know what's up, playa.


854
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.321
I'm sorry, what?

855
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.646
What the hell are you looking at me
so funny for?


856
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.769
Sorry, Santa. I had to go.

857
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.527
Oh, is that you? 
I thought it was me.

858
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.010
Hey, Greta. Could you, uh, get me a rag
and a real drink, please?


859
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:52.444
Of course. I'll be right back.

860
00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.040
Come on. Get out of here.
Put a fucking diaper on.


861
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:09.686
- Hey, you're wet.
- No shit. What can I do for you?


862
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:13.446
Will you be able to find me
at my grandma's house in Grand Rapids?


863
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:18.650
Because no one's going to be
at our Chicago house for two weeks.


864
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:23.208
Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I'll find you.
But, hey, do Santy a favor, will you?


865
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.486
You know the address
of where you're not gonna be?


866
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.682
Write it down on a piece of paper
and bring it back to Santy, will you?


867
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:30.760
All right, honey. Good girl.

868
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.246
What do you want?

869
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:36.408

I have no idea what that shit is.

A stuffed cow that moos but doesn't poop.

878
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.044
- Some duct tape so I can build a boat.
- What?


879
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:08.602
A stuffed cow that moos but doesn't poop.
Some duct tape so I can build a boat.


880
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.124
Okay.

881
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.369
Have a seat. What
can Santy Claus get you?

882
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.760
A penguin. It doesn't have to be alive.

883
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.249
- What's up, champ?
- I want a hand grenade.


884
00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.049
Yeah, well, I want a hand release,

885
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.201
but you don't see me
holding my breath, do you?


886
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:38.886
- What's a hand release?
- It's kind of a compromise.


887
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:42.122
Anyway, Santy ain't no arms dealer,
so I can't help you out.


888
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.361
See you later.

889
00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.210
Let's go.

890
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.728
Oops!

891
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.881
Walk. Don't run!

892
00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.209
That's quite a grip you got there.
What are you, a lumberjack?


893
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:13.567
- Shot put. Olympic alternate.
- Nice.


894
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:16.324
Hey, listen, can you kind of stay up
on the business end


895
00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.129
and stay away from the nuts?

896
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.521
Maybe if you put
your thumb up my ass?

897
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.330
No, I don't do that.

898
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.960
- Kiddums.
- Goddamn it. That's my mom.


899
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.566
- Time to get a move on.
- Ew. Your mom?


900
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.164
Yeah. Help me zip this shit.

901
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.082
What? Ugh.

902
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.840
Davis! Davis!

903
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.769
- Where's your friend at?
- I ain't got any fucking friends!


904
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:52.170
Hey, watch your language.

905
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:55.721
Why don't I watch my dick go in and out
of your wife's pussy lips while I'm at it?


906
00:51:55.810 --> 00:52:00.362
Oh, yeah? Well, joke's on you
because my wife died six months ago. Boom!


907
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:05.286
Like that will fucking stop me?
Rigor mortis just make the pussy tighter.


908
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.441
Oh. Where's Cook?

909
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.086
You see that?

910
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.481
Huh? Yeah.

911
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.802
- We still got it, kid.
- Yeah, I guess so.


912
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.530
It was always supposed
to be this way, William.


913
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:26.082
You, me. Before I fucked it all up.

914
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.205
But even when I was in the joint,
I thought of you.


915
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:34.079
And I always had a drink
on your birthday... January third.


916
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.122
Seventh.

917
00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:40.282
- August fourth.
- Fourth?


918
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.566
And August. Yeah.

919
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.770
Well, fuck a duck.
Anyway, uh, the point is that I miss this.


920
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:53.209
Just think of the damage we could do.
Just the two of us. All the time.


921
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.610
Hey. You know what? 
I got you a gift.

922
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.762
You never got me a gift
in my entire fucking life.


923
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.920
Well, boohoo.

924
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.129
You think it was raining presents
in my backyard when I was a kid?


925
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.124
Look, I'm trying to make up
for lost time here.


926
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.721
- You know, be a better...
- Parent?


927
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:18.161
Yeah. I found this in the bedside table.

928
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.240
Think fast.

929
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.209
The fuck?

930
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.488
- Don't do that.
- Oh, that's for me.


931
00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:27.084
Shut up.

932
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.207
- Pew-pew.
- Don't touch me with the fucking thing.


933
00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:35.129
No, seriously. 
I did get you a gift.

934
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:39.090
- I want you to have this.
- What the fuck's that for?


935
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:44.962
The midget. He tried to kill you once.
I'm not gonna give him a second chance.


936
00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:50.330
- I think he knows better by now, okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.


937
00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:54.450
You're my shitstick. And nobody's
gonna mess with you on my watch.


938
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.400
I'm fine.

939
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:09.480
We gotta get rid of
this van and split up.

940
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.323
- Hey, pull over right here.
- What for?


941
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.163
Just fucking pull over, okay?

942
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.766
Okay, just wait right here.
Keep it running.


943
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:22.444
Be right back.

944
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.323
Wow.

945
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.605
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

946
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.568
Hey! Hey! Open the door!

947
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.162
- Fuck!
- What you got?


948
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.367
Here, drink this.

949
00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:54.362
- You sweet little muskrat.
- Don't get all choked up.


950
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.123
I'm just tired of that fucking coughing.

951
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.685
Ahhh.

952
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:02.650
- I hadn't gotten 'tussed up in a while.
<i>- Yeah.</i>


953
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.768
Nothing but an old address
somewhere outside Albany.


954
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.081
- Nothing else? Shit.
- The guy's a ghost.


955
00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:10.127
Okay, call Detective O'Neill
at Precinct 12.


956
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:13.442
- Have him run a facial rec.
- Fuck yeah. Facial rec.


957
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:16.967
- That's a level-nine surveillance.
- Yeah.


958
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.607
Yes! Oh! Oh!

959
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.049
- Don't hold back.
- Don't hold back?


960
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:43.010
What do you want, a fucking jackhammer?
Goddamn, I nearly broke my fucking pelvis.


961
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.480
No, I mean hurry up and cum.
I can hear someone.


962
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.323
Call me "Santa."

963
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.646
Fine.

964
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.403
- Fuck me, Santa.
- Louder.


965
00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.402
- Fuck me, Santa!
- There you go.


966
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:55.686
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

967
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.730
Fuck me, Santa!
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!


968
00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.290
Fuck me, Santa!

969
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:04.488
Fuck me, Santa!
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!


970
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.482
- No, more.
- Oh, fuck me, Santa!


971
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:09.210
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

972
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.805
Oh.

973
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.200
Merry fucking Christmas.

974
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:22.447
- All right, then.
- That also...


975
00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:25.802
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know!
Uh, it never happened. I get it.


976
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:32.165
Um, I ain't exactly what you call
the romantic type, you know.


977
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:34.890
I don't go in
for all the sappy shit.

978
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:40.648
But, um, I gotta tell you,
you got gigantic titties.


979
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:46.044
- And that's no shit.
- Um... thanks?


980
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:49.168
No sweat.

981
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:51.242
See you.

982
00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.842
Fuck.

983
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.604
- This better be an emergency.
- Willie, where are you?


984
00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:00.961
I'm in Chicago,
but I can't find you anywhere.


985
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.122
Wait, hang on a second.
What are you doing in fucking Chicago?


986
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.361
I wanted to surprise you for Christmas.

987
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.686
The best Christmas gifts
are always a surprise.


988
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:12.889
Are you off of your goddamn nut?
Is that what you do?


989
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.201
<i>You follow people</i>
<i>all the way across the fucking country?</i>


990
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:16.923
Not everyone. Just you.

991
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:20.720
- <i>Are you surprised?</i>
- No, this shit happens every day.


992
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:24.281
- <i>It does?</i>
- No. On what fucking planet...?


993
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.362
<i>Never mind. 
What the fuck are you doing?</i>

994
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:30.922
Uh, Willie, it's really cold here.
I didn't bring a coat. Only my gloves.


995
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.650
<i>Goddamn it. 
You gotta be shitting me.</i>

996
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.325
<i>Do you got a pencil</i>
<i>or some shit to write on?</i>


997
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:54.407
Who is it?

998
00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:02.602
- Who the fuck are you?
- Grandma Willie!


999
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:07.721
And Willie was in such a hurry
to get me my elephant


1000
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.130
that I guess he
forgot to pay for it.

1001
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:13.523
And that made the policemen really mad.
So they followed him back to the house.


1002
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.125
And Willie ran really fast
and he almost got to the door,


1003
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:19.248
but then they shot him
like eight times in the back.


1004
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.970
In the cowboy movies,
they say that's not even fair.


1005
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:26.090
And this is the first present
Willie ever got me for Christmas.


1006
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.206
With his blood.

1007
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:33.604
- Willie, you're home!
- Goddamn, kid. Watch the spine bone.


1008
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:36.250
I was just telling your mom
how you're a hero.


1009
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:39.124
Yeah, yeah. Hang on a second.

1010
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.408
You didn't bring a fucking coat,
but you brought that elephant?


1011
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.688
- You didn't tell me to bring a coat.
- I didn't tell you to come.


1012
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.650
- Is this your spawn?
- Do I look like I made him?


1013
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:52.724
Well, if this ain't fetal alcohol
syndrome, then what the fuck is it?


1014
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.440
- He keeps trying to make me a sandwich.
- That's what he does.


1015
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:59.244
Elf!

1016
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.410
Hey! You get that key?

1017
00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.646
You got smaller.

1018
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.529
What the... Am I tripping?

1019
00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:15.886
You might be, because,
you know, certain pussy


1020
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:19.088
has hallucinogenic aftereffects
if you eat too much of it.


1021
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:23.084
I found out the hard way once
when I messed with my own kind.


1022
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:27.170
One time, I ate too much turkey bacon,
I didn't poop for two weeks.


1023
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.082
For four weeks.

1024
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.966
- The key, shorty.
- Okay, first of all, fuck you!


1025
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:40.168
See that? I told you.
I knew he didn't have it in him.


1026
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:44.005
And second of all,
what in the fuck is he doing here?


1027
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.969
- That is not how you serve a sandwich.
- Willie.


1028
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.087
I'm working on it, okay?

1029
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:51.207
Hey, kid, listen.

1030
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:54.488
This is really not the right place
for you to be, okay?


1031
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:58.120
Because there's not enough beds?
I only counted one, plus a couch.


1032
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.725
- Exactly.
- You should get bunk beds, Willie.


1033
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.039
Yeah, maybe we'll do that.

1034
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:04.645
But, uh, in the meantime,
let's you and me head out, all right?


1035
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:08.280
Bye, Elf. Bye, Willie's mom.

1036
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.920
My mom's in Jesus' house with Mary
and Joseph and the talking walnut.


1037
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:16.524
- You 100 percent sure he's not yours?
- Yeah.


1038
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:19.569
Well, then, cut him loose.
Set some boundaries, for chrissake.


1039
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.200
You can't have every stray
following you around like a lost puppy.


1040
01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:26.010
- Jesus!
- I said I'm going, okay?


1041
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:30.642
Can we get a Chicago pizza?
It's like pizza, but in Chicago.


1042
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.450
Yeah, we'll get a pizza. No sweat.

1043
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:42.401
This is really fun, Willie.
I didn't even know you had a mom.


1044
01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:46.609
- What'd you think? I was just hatched?
- Well, where were you born?


1045
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:51.845
I was born in the Pulaski County Juvenile
Detention Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.


1046
01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:56.083
- Oh, that sounds really nice.
- Well, it wasn't nice.


1047
01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.925
And she's a mean fucking bitch,
so don't go getting any ideas, all right?


1048
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:03.401
Well, sometimes you're not nice.
But you're still Santa.


1049
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:08.201
Listen kid, seriously.
You're all grown-up and shit now, okay?


1050
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.920
- You gotta stop that.
- Well, I know you're not <i>the</i> Santa.


1051
01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.683
But you're still my Santa.

1052
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.486
Come on. Let's go.

1053
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.326
Fuck.

1054
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.128
Fuck! Fucking pussy!

1055
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:02.724
Look at all the Santas!
I really get to stay here?


1056
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.484
Goddamn right.

1057
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.210
So how long is the kid staying here?

1058
01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.282
Hell if I know,
I ain't his fucking secretary.


1059
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:16.002
- You run the joint.
- Cook, you crack me up.


1060
01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.285
I what?

1061
01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:22.321
Boarding room's downstairs on the left.
Any bed that's not taken.


1062
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.366
Alrighty, here we go.

1063
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.487
Now listen,
don't be sitting on any toilet seats.


1064
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.642
If you gotta take a shit
just stand over it, couple of feet away,


1065
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.244
take aim and blow it in there.

1066
01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:37.799
'Cause I'm pretty sure crabs can jump.
All right?


1067
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.325
Don't let anybody muscle up on you
in the showers either,


1068
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.685
because they'll try.

1069
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:44.968
And if a fight breaks out, go straight
for the nuts or gouge an eye out.


1070
01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:51.365
I don't think I like it here, Willie.

1071
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.919
Then you should go home,
like I told you to start with.


1072
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:56.479
But it's not home if there's nobody there.

1073
01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.766
What about Granny?
I'm sure she misses you.


1074
01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.079
- She died.
- When?


1075
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.160
Two years ago.

1076
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:04.288
Same day as the President's Day sale
at Blue Mesa Toyota and Scion


1077
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.680
where they put the "whee" in wheels.

1078
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.484
Well, Granny had a good run.

1079
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.449
She was about

1080
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:16.080
Look at this, this is not so bad.
Look, you got bunk beds.


1081
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.929
Look at that.

1082
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.560
Ow! Goddamn, kid! Fuck!

1083
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.607
- Will we have Christmas together?
- Fuck, I don't know.


1084
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:26.285
- But, Willie...
- No "but, Willie." Goddamn it!


1085
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:29.761
I've been chasing your ass off
ever since I fucking met you.


1086
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:33.645
Do you not take a hint?
I fucking told you that I ain't that guy.


1087
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.649
Life sucks a big, giant dick, kid.

1088
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:39.239
But you're a fucking man now
and you gotta face up to it.


1089
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.322
Welcome to the shit show.

1090
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.730
- But you're my family.
- No, I'm not your family.


1091
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:53.360
- Okay. I'll try to be a man. For you.
- No, not for me. For you.


1092
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:57.007
- Even though I'm all alone.
- You're not all alone.


1093
01:04:57.090 --> 01:05:00.925
Are you shitting me?
I mean, look around here.


1094
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:03.605
You got all these great guys.

1095
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:09.004
Except that one jerking off over there.
And that one watching him jerk off.


1096
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.481
You know what, just kind of stay
in this section right here, okay?


1097
01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.603
You'll be fine.

1098
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.200
Hey.

1099
01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:34.569
- Where the hell have you been?
- What are you, my fucking mother?


1100
01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:36.607
I've been dealing with the kid, all right?

1101
01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:39.444
Oh, well, don't lose your focus.
We still need that key.


1102
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:42.728
I tried seducing the girl myself
but she's strictly dickly.


1103
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:45.564
Concert's tomorrow night.
So you better step up, buddy boy.


1104
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.289
I thought the midget was doing it.

1105
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.885
Marcus couldn't fuck his way out
of a wet paper bag.


1106
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.605
I'll make sure she knows you got
the hots for her.


1107
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.884
- Really?
- That's what he told me.


1108
01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:58.848
Oh, here he comes.

1109
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.887
Of course you may have to make
the first move,


1110
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:02.848
- because he seems like the shy type.
- Okay.


1111
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.765
Hey. We still good for tomorrow? The plan.

1112
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:10.810
- Cutting her out after the grab. Right?
- Yeah, yeah. We're good.


1113
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:15.644
Come on, shitstick.
Bring it on home to Mama.


1114
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.599
Goddamn.

1115
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.402
<i># I just can't

1116

1117
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.165

1118
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.450
Hey, Cook!

1119
01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.963
Mind if join you?

1120
01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:56.724
It's okay to like what you see.
I like what I see.


1121
01:06:58.090 --> 01:06:59.160
Oh, yes!

1122
01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:05.004
Oh, oh, yes!
Oh, oh, yes! Yes, oh, come get there.


1123
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:08.845
Oh, God! Oh, make Mama cum.

1124
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.399
Don't say "Mama." No mom stuff!

1125
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.642
You don't stop till I <i>say</i> stop!

1126
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.565
- Okay, flip over.
- Fine. Bring it.


1127
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.560
Are you washing your fucking hands
right now?


1128
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:25.680
No.

1129
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:29.650
Oh, wait, wait. 
That's not my... Huh.

1130
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.164
Oh, my God!

1131
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:35.324
Oh, my God! That feels amazing! Holy shit!

1132
01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:43.370
Harder!

1133
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.884
Harder! Yes!

1139
01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:35.000
You guys are really good at singing.
I like to sing in the bathtub.


1140
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.128
I'm a soprano. My friend Ronnie says
I sound like Mariah Carey.


1141
01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:44.486
- Hello. What's your name?
- I'm Thurman. Thurman Merman.


1142
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:47.210
For real? Ha!

1143
01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:50.527
Would you like to join us, Thurman?

1144
01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.529
This looks like it might fit.

1145
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.680
- I get to wear this?
- Of course you do.


1146
01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:02.889
You're a Santa now, Thurman.
Go ahead, put it on.


1147
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:09.204
It's got a lot
of paper trash in it,

1148
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:13.204
so I think it should be a light landing
for both of you. Okay?


1149
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.610
So...

1150
01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:18.764
Where the fuck have you been? We gotta
lock everything down for tomorrow.


1151
01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:22.161
That's my boy!

1152
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:25.880
- Shit. How'd you get that?
- He tapped that security girl.


1153
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:30.647
Ha-ha. Very funny. 
Wait... for real?

1154
01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:34.326
I didn't exactly have to talk her into it.
She was wetter than Lake Michigan.


1155
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.606
Matter of fact, 
I think she roofied me.

1156
01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:39.444
Ah, rohypnol. Excellent icebreaker.

1157
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:42.204
Of course, it's harder for the girl
because she's gotta get off


1158
01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:44.202
- before the drugs soften the noodle.
- Yeah.


1159
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.003
Ya! You no good motherfucker!

1160
01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:47.240
- What the fuck?
- You...


1161
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.810
- God!
- Get off of him!


1162
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:50.563
Hey! Get off of him you little shit!

1163
01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:52.164
- I'll kill your ass!
- Let go of me!


1164
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.969
- Motherfucker!
- Get off of him!


1165
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:56.559
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

1166
01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:58.767
Hey, goddamn pussy! 
You motherfucker!

1167
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:01.285
Just get off of him. Hey!

1168
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.329
Goddamn it!

1169
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.845
Ow!

1170
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.960
Goddamn!

1171
01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:16.328
My first shot at a good piece of ass
after nearly ten years


1172
01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:19.209
and you gotta go
and take a dump on that too.


1173
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.963
- Fuck you!
- It was just business.


1174
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.610
You just ruined
a perfectly good piece of pussy


1175
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.647
with that diseased-ass dick of yours.

1176
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:29.804
I'm glad I tea-bagged your drunk ass,
you fucking piece-of-shit motherfucker!


1177
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:33.247
Would you get it together?
Tomorrow is go time.


1178
01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.402
I need some air.

1179
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:44.524
Now, see? Who the fuck does he think
he is talking to you that way?


1180
01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:48.126
- That's it. We're cutting him out.
- What? Fuck no.


1181
01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.282
I mean, he's just steamed a little bit.
He'll be fine.


1182
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:53.680
Okay, you wanna share
half of your take with him?


1183
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:56.444
- Be my guest.
- You know, I don't fucking get you.


1184
01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:58.965
I mean, you're the one
that brought that little shit in.


1185
01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:03.727
No, shitstick. I brought you in.
You're the safe cracker.


1186
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:07.770
He can't even crack his own ass.
Fuck that.


1187
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:10.570
We're going to Mexico.

1188
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:14.087
It's loaded now. 
You're good to go.

1189
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:18.962
You did this whole fucking thing

1190
01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:22.242
just to have me to go
to shit-ass Mexico with you?


1191
01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.882
I just thought it might be fun to spend
Christmas with the only family I got left.


1192
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:31.806
- Why's that such a surprise?
- Well...


1193
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:37.761
You know, they'd grant Charles Manson
fucking parole if it wasn't for one thing.


1194
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:41.844
- He's Charles Manson.
- I get it.


1195
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:47.449
Maybe I don't blame you.
But things change at the end of the road.


1196
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:51.044
Willie?

1197
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.690
- Willie, you in there?
- Get rid of him.


1198
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:59.007
- Is this an emergency?
- No.


1199
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.645
I just wanted to invite you
to the Christmas concert tomorrow, Willie.


1200
01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:02.800
I'm singing in the choir.

1201
01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:06.361
We're doing all the Christmas carols,
"Silent Night," "Deck the Halls,"


1202
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.648
"Jingle Bells," "Veni, Veni, Emmanuel."
That one's in Latin.


1203
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:13.201
I know you're busy, but it's only for
an hour and all the parents are coming.


1204
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.361
And I know you're not my real family,

1205
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.807
but when you don't have real family,
then you have to make a new one.


1206
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:22.164
And it's actually better because then you get
to pick the people who are in your family.


1207
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.604
And you're the family I picked.

1208
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:27.326
And that's why I followed you to Chicago.

1209
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.123
Because I didn't want you
to spend Christmas alone.


1210
01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:34.282
So can you come? And then maybe
after we can go to SantaCon or...


1211
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:37.204
I, I can't. I can't come.

1212
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:47.649
- Look, I'll try to make it. Okay?
- Okay. I'll look for you, Willie.


1213
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.449
I'll look for you
and I'll wave like this. Okay?


1214
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.408
Yeah. Okay, All right. Good deal.

1215
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:55.370
- All right. I'll see you.
- Bye, Willie.


1216
01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:01.130
What are you, the fucking FBI?
That place is gonna be crowded.


1217
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.644
He won't even know I'm not there.

1218
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.289
- Good.
- Good night, Elf!


1219
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:06.282
For a minute there,
I thought you were going soft.


1220
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:13.845
I hate your guts, motherfucker.
But business is business.


1221
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:15.205
Let's do this.

1222
01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.649
- Hi, thank you so much for coming.
- Okay?


1223
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.801
- You look gorgeous.
- Amazing. Hi, good to see you.


1224
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:31.202
- Time?
- Concert starts in five.


1225
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:43.166
As you know,
Christmas is a time for giving.


1226
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.719
And we want to thank you all
for being here tonight.


1227
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:54.963
All right, let's sync them up, boys.
At 7:45, the power goes down.


1228
01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:56.120
That's on me.

1229
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:59.203
You got ten minutes to get
to Regent's office, crack that safe,


1230
01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:01.566
grab the money,
throw it down the garbage chute


1231
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:04.768
and then get the hell out of there
before anybody knows what's hit them.


1232
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:10.084
Now please join me in welcoming
the Giving City Children's Choir.


1233
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:17.479
And without further ado, I would like
to introduce our choirmaster, Renee.


1234
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:22.927
You got a match? 
Well, send it over!

1235
01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:27.084
Now we're gonna get this party started
with an old favorite.


1236
01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:29.560
<i># Deck the halls

1242
01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.639
- This is all your handiwork.
- Huh?


1243
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:03.161
The money you helped us raise,
it gave Christmas to these kids.


1244
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.207
You're part of the family now.

1245
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.166
Hmm.

1246
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:18.965
Ugh! Boring.

1247
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:24.208
Ooh, no teeth. That's hot.

1248
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:32.046
Oh.

1249
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:40.049
Oh, yeah. Who's got the pussy lips now,
motherfucker?


1250
01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:43.721
- I never gave you this.
- Thank you. Thank you.


1251
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:44.800
Room 523.

1252
01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:50.240
I'd like to call to the stage
now a very special member of our choir.


1253
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:54.290
Please say hello to Thurman Merman.
Thurman?

01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:42.969
Find them. All of them!

1270
01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:07.444
Go! Go, go, go, go!

1271
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.759
Gina, check the security cameras.

1272
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:13.170
Copy, checking.

1273
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.680
Oh, shit!

1274
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:28.442
- Three minutes, Willie, come on!
- Shut the fuck up! I can't hear.


1275
01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:31.090
Just hurry your ass!

1276
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:39.000
What the hell is this?

1277
01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.524
Wait, bring up my office,
I wanna see the safe.


1278
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:42.806
I can't, sir.
It still has eight minutes to reboot.


1279
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.244
What? Call the police!

1280
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:45.850
- Let's go, come on!
- I'm on it.


1281
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:50.166
Well, that can't be more
than half a million, 600 tops.


1282
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:51.929
Well, fuck, that's all we got.

1283
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:54.650
Perfect amount for my cut.

1284
01:18:57.850 --> 01:19:03.005
Are you shitting me? Really?
You know the old lady's right.


1285
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:07.687
Not so big now, are you?

1286
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:27.604
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1287
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.083
Motherfuckers!

1288
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:36.245
- Lock it down. The whole building!
- We're on a level-ten lockdown.


1289
01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:37.605
Lockdown level ten.

1290
01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:41.488
- Get in!
- You get in!


1291
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.209
Evacuate the concert! 
And search everyone.

1292
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:56.001
Halle-fucking-lujah!

1293
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.161
Oh, baby!

1294
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:02.324
Oh!

1295
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:05.442
Sweet Jesus, you made it!

1296
01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:08.364
What's the fucking Santy Claus outfit
all about?


1297
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:10.123
Now step the fuck back!

1298
01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:13.328
- What are you doing, runt?
- It's called thinning the herd.


1299
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.767
World's gonna be a better place
without the fucking Sokes in it.


1300
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:19.206
I'm gonna live like a king this time.

1301
01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:22.601
- A fucking sultan!
- Not in this lifetime, Sparky.


1302
01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:26.400
- The bag goes with me.
- You mean with us.


1303
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:30.166
- No, I mean me.
- What the fuck did you just say?


1304
01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:34.369
When I said this was my last job,
I meant it was my last job with you.


1305
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:39.760
I knew I should've left, second
I saw your miserable fucking face.


1306
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:43.129
Why did I forget?

1307
01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:46.647
Nice job on the safe, though.
Yeah, I'm real proud of you.


1308
01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:49.086
Well, you know something, Mama?

1309
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:51.162
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.


1310
01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:54.721
Did you forget about this?

1311
01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:57.644
Oh, how could I have forgotten?

1312
01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:02.001
Go ahead. Shoot me, shitstick.

1313
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.209
They're blanks, Willie.

1314
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:23.967
You really think I'd be dumb enough
to put real bullets in that gun?


1315
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:27.600
Well, I ain't afraid of you, bitch!
I'll blow a hole through your ass so...


1316
01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:33.089
The fuck?

1317
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:35.048
Drop your weapons!
Put your hands in the...


1318
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.487
Hey, hang on a second. She's got
the money, I'm just a fucking guy!


1319
01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:07.279
Willie! Hey, Willie!

1320
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.564
Ticket please.

1321
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:40.530
Let us through right now.
We're chasing a suspect.


1322
01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:14.010
Come here.

1323
01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:34.321
Come on, man.

1324
01:23:52.530 --> 01:23:55.204
Hey!

1325
01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:59.603
- Found this on the coffee table.
- Well, hoo-fucking-rah, William.


1326
01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:02.364
Well, give me the fucking bag.
I'm taking this back to the kids.


1327
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:04.646
I'd rather them have it
than your sorry ass.


1328
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:08.446
- Don't test me, boy.
- You're gonna shoot me too?


1329
01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:19.205
- You fucking shot me!
- I told you I would. You never listen.


1330
01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:25.645
Let go of the bag, William.
Let go of the bag.


1331
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:29.167
Goddamn it, let go of the fucking bag!

1332
01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:39.126
Money!

1333
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:43.049
It's raining money!

1334
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.044
She's got a gun!

1335
01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:53.449
Willie!

1336
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:58.964
Drop the weapon! Get down!

1337
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.042
The fuck is going on? 
Hey, goddamn it!

1338
01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:04.568
I caught a fucking
midget-murdering fucking armed robber.


1339
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:06.164
I'm a goddamn hero.

1340
01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:27.209
Don't worry, Willie. I'm okay.
It's just in my butt.


1341
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:30.800
Willie?

1342
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:33.724
No!

1343
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:38.247
Oh, f...

1344
01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:43.523
Stand clear.

1345
01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:50.366
Oh! Fuck me!

1346
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.363
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.


1347
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.448
<i>Well, I guess this is</i>
<i>what they call a happy ending.</i>


1348
01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:08.444
<i>But as far as Christmas miracles go,</i>
<i>shit, I don't know.</i>


1349
01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:11.329
<i>That asshole Regent ended up</i>
<i>getting busted</i>


1350
01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:14.608
<i>while I got off clean by ratting out</i>
<i>my steaming pile of shit mother.</i>


1351
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.280
<i>Guess I did learn one thing about family</i>
<i>from that crazy bitch.</i>


1352
01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:23.647
<i>And that is, if yours happens to be</i>
<i>a bag of dicks, then fuck them.</i>


1353
01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:26.370
- <i>Start over.</i>
<i>- # Oh, yeah, candles burning low #</i>


1354
01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:29.602
<i># Lots of mistletoe #</i>

1355
01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:33.722
<i># Lots of snow and ice #</i>

1356
01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:36.723
<i># Everywhere we go #</i>

1357
01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:39.450
<i># Choirs singing carols #</i>

1358
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:42.250
<i># Right outside my door #</i>

1359
01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:45.323
<i># All these things and more #</i>

1360
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:47.606
<i># All these things and more, babe #</i>

1361
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:56.281
<i># That's what Christmas means to me</i>
<i>My love #</i>


1362
01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:58.521
<i># Yeah #</i>

1363
01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:03.960
<i>So maybe there is no such thing</i>
<i>as a Christmas miracle, or whatever.</i>


1364
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:11.523
<i>But I've worn the suit enough to know</i>
<i>a perfect Christmas gift when I see one.</i>


1365
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:20.562
<i>And like the kid says,</i>
<i>"The best gifts are always a surprise."</i>


1366
01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:30.808
<i>So if a happy ending is staring at you</i>
<i>right in the fucking face,</i>


1367
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:35.567
<i>then just say, "All right,</i>
<i>I guess I'll take it."</i>


1368
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:39.081
<i># And wish you
a Merry Christmas, baby #</i>

1369
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:40.763
<i># Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby #</i>

1370
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:46.960
<i># And such happiness
in the coming year #</i>

1371
01:27:47.050 --> 01:27:50.361
<i># Baby, baby, baby #</i>

1372
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.760
<i># All these things and more, baby #</i>

1373
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:59.563
<i># That's what Christmas means to me</i>
<i>My love #</i>
