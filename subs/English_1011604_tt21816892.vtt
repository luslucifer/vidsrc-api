1
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.536
All right.
Well, the water looks good.


2
00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:10.604
I think we're all set.

3
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.973
It hasn't rained in a while,

4
00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.773
so there should
be maximum visibility.


5
00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:30.958
Just follow my lead.

6
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, right.

7
00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.426
I'm not the one who wanted
to quit early last time.


8
00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.595
You follow my lead.

9
00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.999
Oh, I see how it is.

10
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.234
First person out of the water
buys drinks tonight.


11
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.202
Oh, you are on.

12
00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.754
Got you!

13
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.490
Just dive, you goofball.

14
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.081
Mike!
Mike!


15
00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.564
Ah!

16
00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:20.660
Are you sure this
is the right pier?


17
00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.297
That's what
the directions said.


18
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.697
Do you have all your gear?

19
00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.435
Yes, Dad. I double checked
this morning.


20
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.702
All right, let's go.

21
00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.877
It's supposed to be
around here somewhere.


22
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.180
With a name like the Jubilation,

23
00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.015
it shouldn't be
that hard to find.


24
00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:43.716
Well, you could just starting
screaming, "Jubilation!


25
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.819
Jubilation!"

26
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.387
That should get their attention.

27
00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:47.922
I don't know if that's the
attention I want, Dad.


28
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:52.659
You know, I really wish you
were coming on this one with me.


29
00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.196
One of my sea legs is faulty.

30
00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.798
But as soon as I get my bum leg
out of this stinky cast,


31
00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.869
we'll hit
the high seas again, okay?


32
00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.905
On this one, you need
to scout


33
00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.908
this new charter boat
and the captain.


34
00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.311
Make sure they are
both up to snuff, okay?


35
00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.213
Sir, yes, sir.

36
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.948
On a very important
scouting mission.


37
00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:16.517
What's the name
of this captain again? Banning?


38
00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:18.185
Captain Banning.

39
00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:20.921
And remember, be respectful
of her and her boat, okay,


40
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.924
just like Papi taught you.

41
00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.295
Hey, can you slow down
just a little bit?


42
00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:29.629
They won't
leave without you, I promise.


43
00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.899
I paid a lot for this charter.

44
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.101
Are you okay?

45
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:39.974
Si.

46
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.042
I just wanted to show you this.

47
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.679
You did not bring this picture!

48
00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.950
I did bring this picture.

49
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.819
It's so embarrassing.

50
00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:53.387
You know, I'm glad you're
not coming on this trip.


51
00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:55.122
-You're way too embarrassing.
-You take that back!


52
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.292
Okay, fine. I wish you were
coming on this trip.


53
00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:59.759
But enough with
the picture already.


54
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.162
I love this picture!
Look at you.


55
00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:02.396
So determined.

56
00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.365
Eight years old, out
in the pouring rain


57
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.201
at the break of dawn
tossing that reel over and over


58
00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.702
again trying to nab
the big one, huh?


59
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.405
Just like Papi?

60
00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:15.109
Yeah, well, I hope I get to reel
in some big yellowfin soon.


61
00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.179
Oh, wait.

62
00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:20.014
I think I see it.

63
00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:26.719
Yeah, that's it, the Jubilation.

64
00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.755
Kind of looks like an old boat.

65
00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.157
Uh-huh.

66
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:33.594
So you want me
to walk you out on the boat?


67
00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.829
No, Dad.
I'm a big girl.


68
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.464
I think I can handle
this on my own.


69
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.866
Okay, good.

70
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.301
'Cause I don't think this cast

71
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.102
will make it out
on that rickety dock.


72
00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.240
Dad...

73
00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:51.812
Okay, remember, be respectful of
the captain and her boat, okay?


74
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.015
Oh, and if you need
any tips, you call me?


75
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:56.684
-Yeah.
-Okay.


76
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.919
Oh, and photos.
Take lots of photos.


77
00:06:58.986 --> 00:06:59.954
Okay, lot of pics,
yeah, okay, I got it.


78
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.488
I gotta go.
I'm late.


79
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.158
-Bye, I love you.
-Okay. I love you too, Lucia.


80
00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:11.298
My little angler.

81
00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:15.069
Okay, then.

82
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.512
Captain Banning?

83
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.648
Yep, that's me.

84
00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:29.749
Oh, I thought...

85
00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.819
You thought you'd
see a woman, right?


86
00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:35.456
N-n-no, I didn't think...

87
00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:38.525
I wanna captain
my own boat one day.


88
00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:39.860
My dad just...

89
00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.862
It's okay, it's okay.

90
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.796
I guess with a name like
Shelly you can't help it.


91
00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:47.334
People see the paperwork before
they get here all the time,


92
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.769
they think they're gonna
see some old salty sea hag.


93
00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:53.407
Then they see me and you have
that same look on your face


94
00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:58.679
that you have when they see
this salty old sea dog instead.


95
00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:00.614
You must be Lucia.

96
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.049
That's me.

97
00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:03.851
Jump on aboard, Lucia.

98
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.386
Thanks.

99
00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.888
I'm looking forward to
catching some yellowfins.


100
00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.356
My dad and I,
we caught some


101
00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.091
a few years back up north
in San Diego.


102
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:13.627
Yeah. Fish is good up there,

103
00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:17.064
especially this time of the
year, but we have bigger ones.


104
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.803
Your fellow anglers
have arrived.


105
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.405
Oh, I can't wait
to get out there, D.


106
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.840
I haven't gone fishing in
I don't know how long.


107
00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:28.942
And the horseback riding
on the beach tomorrow...


108
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.578
one for the bucket list.

109
00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:32.880
And today I get to take off

110
00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.882
deep sea fishing
off my bucket list.


111
00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:37.985
Me too.

112
00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:40.120
Who knows?
Maybe I'm secretly an expert.


113
00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:44.124
Well, there's
only way to find out.


114
00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:52.700
Hey, I'm Wyatt.
This is my fiancÄ‚Â©, Donna.


115
00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.902
Hi.

116
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.203
This is Lucia.

117
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.404
Hey.

118
00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.006
And I'm your captain
for the day.


119
00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:00.741
Call me Banning,
Captain Banning,


120
00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:01.810
whatever you want.

121
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.544
Just don't call me Shelly.

122
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:08.749
Got the new radio, Captain.

123
00:09:08.817 --> 00:09:10.884
And this here's Shatto.

124
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:13.787
He really doesn't talk much.

125
00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:15.389
He talks enough for both of us.

126
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.126
Shatto's my first mate.

127
00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:20.994
You been mate
for how long, Shatto?


128
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.896
Uh, too long.

129
00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:27.301
Too long, yep.
That's about right.


130
00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:29.937
We got a few life vests for you.

131
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.575
Do we have to wear these?

132
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.877
I'm just concerned... I'm really
trying to get like a tan.


133
00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.579
And I don't want to mess
up a tan line, you know.


134
00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:41.582
Uh, if you're
on this ship, you do.


135
00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:42.883
It's regulations.

136
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.085
No exceptions, no excuses.

137
00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:46.920
You can probably
take it off later on


138
00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:48.422
when we get past
the Coast Guard.


139
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.658
I can make this work.

140
00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.961
We're gonna have to
make helmets work tomorrow


141
00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:54.962
for horseback riding.

142
00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:57.798
I guess you're right, D.

143
00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:59.466
So there's
a little something


144
00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:02.636
that I like to do
before we go on a voyage.


145
00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:06.473
Not that I believe in luck, but
it's supposed to bring us some.


146
00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:09.943
So here goes.

147
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.012
It's a fisherman's poem.

148
00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:16.818
"Give me luck to
catch a fish so big


149
00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:20.788
"so that even I, when
talking about it afterwards,


150
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.489
may not ever have to lie."

151
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:29.898
Shatto, let's get this
"before" pic out the way.


152
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.433
And maybe the "after" pic,

153
00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.135
the boat will be filled with
fish bigger than your dreams.


154
00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:36.670
Yeah.

155
00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.105
Hey, my dad used
to have a camera


156
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:39.640
like that when I was a kid.

157
00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:44.011
You hear that, Shatto?
We're older than dirt.


158
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.548
Come on.
Huddle up together, y'all.


159
00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.219
-Say "feesh"!
-Feesh!


160
00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.170
Hey, you know, my
pop taught me


161
00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:11.906
how to drive a boat like
this when I was a kid.


162
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.574
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.


163
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.910
What do you think about me
taking it for a joy ride


164
00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.744
once we're on the open water?

165
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.815
Not on your life, kid.

166
00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:25.185
Besides, you're gonna be too
busy pulling in a lot of fish.


167
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.154
So you won't be able
to steer this vessel.


168
00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:29.556
Worth a shot.

169
00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:32.827
Now you all have your
licenses intact,


170
00:11:32.894 --> 00:11:34.061
which means you're gonna be on

171
00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.230
the Jubilation for
like five hours.


172
00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:39.800
Now the Jubilation
may not look like much,


173
00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:44.538
but she's a tough old broad,
kind of like my ex-wife.


174
00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.541
Now I won her
in a high-stakes poker game


175
00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:51.144
in Chicago playing against
a Lake Michigan pirate.


176
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.815
He could barely hold his hand.

177
00:11:53.882 --> 00:11:59.253
So I skunked him and he followed
me all throughout Lake Michigan,


178
00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:03.992
Erie and Superior
trying to get his boat back.


179
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.759
So I had to come all the way
to Cabo


180
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.194
just to get him off my tail.

181
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.196
True story.

182
00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:11.331
We're gonna go out
a little bit further.


183
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.669
You can blame it on
global warming, the Illuminati,


184
00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:17.671
Big Foot, I don't care.

185
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:22.810
It's just that fishing's
been a little light this season,


186
00:12:22.877 --> 00:12:24.244
but I know a place.

187
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:27.180
We go out further where
you're gonna catch


188
00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.952
a certain amount of
divine yellowfish tuna


189
00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:32.686
that you've ever seen.

190
00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:37.291
So just sit your butts
in your seat and enjoy the ride.


191
00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:19.232
He's a character.

192
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.534
That he is, bro.

193
00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.938
How long you been
doing this for?


194
00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:25.974
A few years.

195
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.877
Captain took me in when I was
caught up in some bad stuff.


196
00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:34.015
Taught me everything I need
to know about this boat.


197
00:13:34.082 --> 00:13:36.149
Gave me some purpose, you know.

198
00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.219
He knows what
he's doing, though.


199
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.024
That story about
him winning the boat


200
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.827
in a poker game, is that true?

201
00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:48.830
No clue, and I've asked.

202
00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:51.431
I can never get a
straight answer out of him.


203
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.669
Details change from one
charter to the next, though.


204
00:14:05.746 --> 00:14:07.581
You know, you really
shouldn't text on a boat.


205
00:14:09.117 --> 00:14:10.384
It'll make you puke.

206
00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.187
Not me.

207
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.924
I've never gotten seasick once.

208
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.159
Lucky you.

209
00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.560
Texting your boyfriend?

210
00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:24.065
My dad.

211
00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:25.232
He worries.

212
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:27.101
Only child?

213
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.502
Yeah.

214
00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:30.071
Me too.

215
00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:32.874
Sometimes
you love the smothering.


216
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.276
Sometimes the smothering
is just so... smothering.


217
00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:38.345
Yeah, sometimes.

218
00:14:39.814 --> 00:14:41.548
It's just been him
and I for so long.


219
00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:45.619
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
but I know the feeling.


220
00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:49.023
I'm lucky to have found Wyatt.

221
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.724
He has four brothers.

222
00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.727
Family gatherings will
never be boring again.


223
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.230
That's beautiful.

224
00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:59.199
Oh, thank you.

225
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:02.170
Yeah, he's got good taste.

226
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.237
Think I'll keep him.

227
00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:06.740
It seems like he
really loves you.


228
00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:09.676
Like I said,
he's got good taste.


229
00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.797
Woo-hoo!

230
00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:42.709
This is it, y'all!

231
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:47.414
Water's a bit choppy,
but this is my secret spot.


232
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:48.983
You can't see it right now,

233
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.021
but you look right over there,
that's a sandbar.


234
00:15:54.088 --> 00:15:55.789
Kinda acts as a barrier,

235
00:15:55.857 --> 00:16:00.393
sort of funnels
the bigger fish this way.


236
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.463
Later on this evening
when the tide recedes,


237
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.533
those beautiful yellowfin tuna

238
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.636
will have no place to go but
jump on our hooks.


239
00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:25.285
Nice setup you got there.

240
00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:26.620
Thanks.

241
00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.824
My dad and I kinda
collect lures.


242
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:32.193
When I was a kid,
I would beg my dad


243
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.862
to bring me to the sport shop
whenever I had enough money


244
00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:38.565
in my allowance
or birthday card.


245
00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:40.367
I'd run right to
the fishing section


246
00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:44.872
and I'd spend hours picking out
a rainbow jig or fly spinner.


247
00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:49.076
Well, I see you
got one of these.


248
00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:53.346
I got one of these, but never
had to use it, though.


249
00:16:54.115 --> 00:16:56.150
Gotta be prepared.

250
00:16:56.217 --> 00:16:57.517
I see you are.

251
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.621
Sure you don't wanna
use live bait?


252
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:06.060
I mean, those yellowfins
sure do love some mackerel.


253
00:17:06.127 --> 00:17:09.030
Thanks.
I prefer the jig.


254
00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:11.098
Less chance of the bait
coming off the hook.


255
00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:16.871
But I will give the mackerel
a shot if my jigs don't hold up.


256
00:17:18.306 --> 00:17:20.574
Spoken like a true angler.

257
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.443
I'm gonna let you get to it.

258
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.512
Think I'm gonna check
on our happy couple.


259
00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.895
You two better get
some bait on your hooks.


260
00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:48.635
Oh, those are definitely
not beers.


261
00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:50.938
Nope.
Frozen mackerel.


262
00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:54.774
Those yellowfins will gobble
them bad boys up, I guarantee.


263
00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:58.346
Shatto, help this fine couple
bait their hooks up, will you?


264
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.181
Aye, Cap.

265
00:18:00.248 --> 00:18:01.315
You wanna give it a try?

266
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.682
Why don't you do the first one

267
00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.518
so we'll know how
to do it properly?


268
00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:10.557
You're gonna want to get it
right through the eyes.


269
00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:13.560
Right through there
so they can't turn around


270
00:18:13.627 --> 00:18:15.729
and bite the hook.
See?


271
00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:16.898
I see.

272
00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:20.667
Right through there. All right.
You can try the next one.


273
00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:23.703
You're all ready to reel in a
real prize catch there, D.


274
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.073
I already got
a prize catch, babe.


275
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.875
Ooh.

276
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:46.459
How about we up-anchor
and move a bit further out?


277
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.933
Whatever you say, Captain.

278
00:19:07.415 --> 00:19:09.350
Sure about this, Cap?

279
00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:12.219
We never been this far
out on the charter before.


280
00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:14.487
You know, there's a lot more
dangerous things than yellowfin


281
00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:16.190
in the deep water.

282
00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:18.591
Shatto, they came to catch fish.

283
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.593
They don't wanna waste
their time and money.


284
00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:22.696
We'll be fine.

285
00:19:45.353 --> 00:19:46.988
Yeah.

286
00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:48.456
Yeah, understood.

287
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.590
I'll have him in the sky ASAP.

288
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:02.736
Davila, we need you
in the air now.


289
00:20:02.803 --> 00:20:04.704
We just got a report
of a jet ski attack


290
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:06.539
involving sharks.

291
00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:08.742
We need to make
sure these shivers


292
00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:10.744
aren't moving closer to shore.

293
00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:11.979
On my way, Officer Fuentes.

294
00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:39.874
Do you see anything?

295
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.845
Nothing yet.
Just some jet ski debris.


296
00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:49.316
Wait, wait.

297
00:20:49.383 --> 00:20:50.617
I see a whole shiver.

298
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.588
They're attacking the
jet ski debris.


299
00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:56.756
But it makes no sense.

300
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:58.926
There's nothing for them to eat.

301
00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:05.199
These sharks have gotten more
aggressive in recent years.


302
00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:09.370
My brother just had a run-in,
I don't know, a few months ago.


303
00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:12.473
Yeah, it looks like they're
staying away from shore,


304
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.042
moving more out
in the open water.


305
00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:16.177
Copy that.

306
00:21:19.814 --> 00:21:22.582
My recommendation is to send
a warning out


307
00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:24.584
to all vessels within

308
00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:29.356
No in-water activities, no
swimming or diving, no fishing.


309
00:21:29.423 --> 00:21:32.725
These sharks have become
hyper-aggressive nowadays.


310
00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.562
All right.

311
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.830
I'll get
the word out immediately,


312
00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.231
but you keep flying.

313
00:21:37.298 --> 00:21:39.066
See if you can spot
any more of them.


314
00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:41.402
And see if you find out exactly
where they're heading.


315
00:21:41.469 --> 00:21:42.803
Copy that.

316
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.405
I'll stay as close
to them as I can.


317
00:21:44.472 --> 00:21:45.806
All right, good.
Out.


318
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:48.976
Open an emergency line.

319
00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:52.980
Warning!

320
00:21:53.047 --> 00:21:55.416
All vessels must cease in-water
activity immediately!


321
00:21:55.483 --> 00:21:59.153
Make your way back to shore
only if safe to do so!


322
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.455
Be on heightened
alert for sharks.


323
00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:04.325
Contact Marine Search
and Rescue if spotted.


324
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:08.863
I repeat, all vessels must cease
in-water activity immediately!


325
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.374
Do you want me to help?

326
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.578
This one is kind of putting
a fight, but I think I got it.


327
00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:59.180
-You got it?
-Got it!


328
00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:00.147
No problem!

329
00:23:02.249 --> 00:23:03.517
She's got one?

330
00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:05.085
She's got one!

331
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.955
Whoa!

332
00:23:08.022 --> 00:23:09.890
Looks like we got
a pro over here!


333
00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:13.994
Let's see, a really nice one!

334
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:15.296
Woo!

335
00:23:18.332 --> 00:23:19.732
First catch of the day.
Now, who's next?


336
00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.602
Woo!

337
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:23.003
Wow.

338
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.405
I can't wait to tell my dad!

339
00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.739
I can fillet it up later
for you if you want


340
00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:27.740
or if you want
a mount or whatever.


341
00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:29.243
Not sure.

342
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.212
I might catch a bigger one
with my next cast.


343
00:23:31.278 --> 00:23:35.149
- Okay.
- I like that spirit!


344
00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:02.209
Oh, my God.

345
00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:04.812
Oh, my God!

346
00:24:06.513 --> 00:24:07.780
All right, just stay calm.

347
00:24:07.848 --> 00:24:10.618
Go easy with it.

348
00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:11.919
Just start
to slowly bring it in.


349
00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:13.621
-Okay.
-Reel it in.


350
00:24:13.687 --> 00:24:15.723
The more you fight, the more the
fish will do the same, okay?


351
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.757
Okay.
Wyatt, I caught a fish!


352
00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:19.059
You got a fish.

353
00:24:21.862 --> 00:24:23.330
-You got this, D.!
-Oh, my God.


354
00:24:23.397 --> 00:24:26.467
Looks like a lucky day
on the Jubilation!


355
00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:29.470
It usually takes about an hour
before we get the first bite.


356
00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:32.606
Just take it easy,
reel it in and pull.


357
00:24:32.673 --> 00:24:35.109
Reel and pull.

358
00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:40.381
Reel and pull!

359
00:24:40.447 --> 00:24:45.152
Reel and pull! 
Reel and pull!

360
00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:11.545
Get her on the boat!

361
00:25:11.612 --> 00:25:15.316
Wyatt! Wyatt!

362
00:25:15.382 --> 00:25:16.984
I've got you, D.!

363
00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:20.387
Wyatt! Wyatt!

364
00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:22.723
Hold on!
Pull her back in the boat.


365
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.024
Just hold on!

366
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:25.326
Help me up, Wyatt!

367
00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:29.229
Wyatt!

368
00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:41.308
Here! Here!
This might help!


369
00:25:43.444 --> 00:25:44.745
Grab the net!

370
00:25:44.813 --> 00:25:46.980
Come on!

371
00:25:48.817 --> 00:25:51.051
Stop, stop!

372
00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:53.887
She's gone!

373
00:25:53.954 --> 00:25:56.757
No, no!

374
00:25:56.825 --> 00:25:59.693
I can't let her get away!

375
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.095
Wyatt, no!

376
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:03.163
No! No!

377
00:26:08.135 --> 00:26:11.038
I see it, it's right
by the motor!


378
00:26:17.444 --> 00:26:20.180
Out of my chair, Wyatt!
Out of my chair!


379
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:22.649
I told you, I'm the only
one that pilots this ship!


380
00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:25.052
Cut the engine!

381
00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:26.653
We gotta keep moving!

382
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.921
Cut the engine, Cap!
There's something wrong with it!


383
00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:28.922
We gotta get to shore!

384
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.394
We've got to get to shore!

385
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.129
We're gonna be
in major trouble if we don't!


386
00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:36.430
We're gonna be
in trouble if we do!


387
00:26:38.867 --> 00:26:39.800
-No!
-We've got to get Donna!


388
00:26:39.868 --> 00:26:41.135
She's gone!

389
00:26:41.201 --> 00:26:43.504
-We gotta do something!
-She's gone!


390
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.139
-I gotta get Donna!
-She's gone, bro!


391
00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:47.441
-I gotta get Donna!
-She's gone!


392
00:26:47.508 --> 00:26:50.411
-Donna! Donna!
-Wyatt, she's gone!


393
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.999
Come on!

394
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.368
Come on!

395
00:27:19.339 --> 00:27:21.141
Ah!

396
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.951
I'm sorry, Donna.

397
00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:33.220
I'm so sorry.

398
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.292
You tried your best
to help her, bro.


399
00:27:39.193 --> 00:27:41.562
That's not gonna bring her back.

400
00:28:03.317 --> 00:28:06.253
Donna... She's gone.

401
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.455
She's really gone, man.

402
00:28:10.959 --> 00:28:15.195
I had her in my hands and
she was just here a second ago.


403
00:28:16.898 --> 00:28:21.001
She didn't even want
to go on this fishing trip.


404
00:28:21.068 --> 00:28:23.003
She did it for me.

405
00:28:24.338 --> 00:28:29.409
We were supposed to go horseback
riding on the beach.


406
00:28:47.962 --> 00:28:49.530
I'm...

407
00:28:49.596 --> 00:28:51.064
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:54.101
I mean this is horrible, I know.

409
00:28:56.403 --> 00:28:58.505
I'm sorry about Donna, Wyatt.

410
00:29:01.642 --> 00:29:04.411
We gotta figure out how
we can get back to shore.


411
00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:10.985
I mean, we've already
lost one passenger and...


412
00:29:11.051 --> 00:29:14.022
The shark's trashed our engine.

413
00:29:14.121 --> 00:29:16.189
Yeah?

414
00:29:16.256 --> 00:29:19.793
What are you gonna
do about it, huh, Captain?


415
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:21.328
What's your plan?

416
00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:27.634
Wyatt, I think I can fix this.

417
00:29:27.701 --> 00:29:30.604
Let me get what's left
of the net.


418
00:29:49.824 --> 00:29:52.092
I gotta free up the engine
before she'll start.


419
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:53.560
Shark's caught up in it.

420
00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:58.131
Not looking good, Cap.

421
00:29:59.834 --> 00:30:03.170
I don't know how we're
gonna get her operational.


422
00:30:03.236 --> 00:30:05.405
She's not gonna move like this.

423
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:22.356
I see a problem I can fix.

424
00:30:22.422 --> 00:30:24.391
Let me help you there.

425
00:30:27.394 --> 00:30:29.162
Ah, hooked yourself, huh?

426
00:30:30.397 --> 00:30:32.199
It isn't the first time.

427
00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:36.938
You'd be surprised how
many hooks


428
00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:39.506
I've cut out of people
since I started this business.


429
00:30:44.144 --> 00:30:47.280
Okay, keep it steady,
keep it steady. Keep it steady.


430
00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:49.683
-Okay, okay.
-Keep it steady.


431
00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:57.224
Well, I had this one group
of kids


432
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.159
that were casting their
poles like


433
00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:01.461
they were fly-fishing
on an open river.


434
00:31:04.264 --> 00:31:08.435
So this one kid whips
his pole back


435
00:31:08.502 --> 00:31:13.473
and the hook gets caught
in the scalp of the other kid


436
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.177
behind him,
right there behind his ear.


437
00:31:17.244 --> 00:31:20.313
So the kid with the pole
just starts yanking


438
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.884
like he thought his hook

439
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.352
was stuck in a net
or something, I guess.


440
00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:31.291
So the other kid
behind him is...


441
00:31:31.358 --> 00:31:35.195
grabbing the hook out his scalp

442
00:31:35.262 --> 00:31:37.899
and just screaming,

443
00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:40.600
like, ahh!

444
00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:46.773
I tried to help,
but I just couldn't get


445
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:50.677
to the back of
the stern fast enough.


446
00:31:51.778 --> 00:31:54.816
How did the kid take it,
removing the hook?


447
00:31:56.783 --> 00:31:59.352
Well...

448
00:31:59.419 --> 00:32:03.557
Let's just say you did
better than him, champ.


449
00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:07.627
Let me patch that up.

450
00:32:14.234 --> 00:32:15.669
Okay, keep it right there.

451
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:21.843
Whoa.

452
00:32:23.744 --> 00:32:25.512
It's still alive?

453
00:32:31.485 --> 00:32:33.420
Shatto!
Get back!


454
00:32:35.823 --> 00:32:38.325
I got this.

455
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.628
I don't want to be useless.

456
00:32:43.363 --> 00:32:44.564
All right. We can get out
of this


457
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.067
if we work together, brother.

458
00:32:46.134 --> 00:32:48.335
-All right?
-All right, fine.


459
00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:03.818
Dude!

460
00:33:03.885 --> 00:33:05.820
Antagonizing the shark
is not gonna help anything!


461
00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:10.423
Fine.

462
00:33:12.193 --> 00:33:13.593
What do you want me to do?

463
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.428
Right now we have to focus
on getting the oar


464
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:17.297
between the shark
and the engine.


465
00:33:17.364 --> 00:33:18.900
Can you do this?

466
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.236
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:33:22.302 --> 00:33:23.637
Let's go!

468
00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:30.477
Come on!
Get deep in there!


469
00:33:30.544 --> 00:33:32.113
You gotta get all
the way in there.


470
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.281
I'm trying.

471
00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:34.849
Come on, push!

472
00:33:37.084 --> 00:33:39.020
Keep pushing!

473
00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:41.721
-It's moving, man!
-Keep going, keep going.


474
00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:42.890
It's moving!

475
00:33:47.895 --> 00:33:49.496
Oh, shit!

476
00:33:49.563 --> 00:33:51.866
Man overboard!
Get him the oar!


477
00:33:54.302 --> 00:33:55.903
Wyatt! Wyatt!

478
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:56.938
Pull him in!

479
00:33:58.072 --> 00:33:59.739
Do you see him?

480
00:34:05.313 --> 00:34:06.780
He's over here!

481
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.483
Get back into the boat!

482
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.651
Wyatt, get out of
the water right now!


483
00:34:11.718 --> 00:34:13.120
Back here!
Come on, Wyatt!


484
00:34:13.187 --> 00:34:14.822
Get back to the boat!

485
00:34:26.334 --> 00:34:27.335
I'll kill you,
you piece of shit!


486
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.435
Wyatt, listen to me!

487
00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:30.171
This will not bring her back!

488
00:34:30.238 --> 00:34:32.940
Wyatt, get out of the water
and get in the boat!


489
00:34:41.249 --> 00:34:42.649
Wyatt, get back in the boat!

490
00:34:42.716 --> 00:34:46.419
Hey, you guys see that?
I killed the shark!


491
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:50.790
Wyatt! Look out!
There's another one!


492
00:34:58.632 --> 00:34:59.633
-Wyatt!
-Come on, Wyatt!


493
00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:01.869
-Swim!
-Faster!


494
00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:06.606
Wyatt!

495
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:21.588
We gotta get
this engine sorted out.


496
00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:23.423
There's more of them.

497
00:35:26.294 --> 00:35:27.661
We gotta move, Captain.

498
00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:38.406
Three of them.

499
00:35:38.471 --> 00:35:40.041
Never seen them act
this way before.


500
00:35:40.841 --> 00:35:43.144
Probably desperate for food

501
00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.446
with the number of fish
being so low this year.


502
00:35:46.513 --> 00:35:47.480
Exactly.

503
00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:49.083
I mean, either we sit here

504
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.584
and wait for them to come to us
or we get back to shore.


505
00:35:53.687 --> 00:35:55.856
Back to shore.

506
00:35:55.923 --> 00:35:57.524
I agree.

507
00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:00.460
Shatto, see if you can
get that engine fixed.


508
00:36:01.594 --> 00:36:02.930
On it, Captain.

509
00:36:07.534 --> 00:36:08.568
No luck, captain.

510
00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:10.304
It's pretty shot.

511
00:36:10.371 --> 00:36:12.572
I want to check the electrical
and see if that's the issue.


512
00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:16.776
Gotcha. And the radio signal
is being spotty.


513
00:36:17.577 --> 00:36:20.147
Any ideas?

514
00:36:20.214 --> 00:36:22.515
You know, I don't
bring my phone onboard.


515
00:36:22.582 --> 00:36:23.818
I got a phone.

516
00:36:26.087 --> 00:36:28.055
What's the emergency
number in Mexico?


517
00:36:29.156 --> 00:36:31.758
Same as it is in
the United States, kid.


518
00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:32.893
911.

519
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.096
But good luck
with getting through.


520
00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:39.066
Fast response is
not their forte around here.


521
00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:41.435
I'll call my dad. He knows a lot
of people in the area


522
00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:42.736
who might be able to help.

523
00:36:46.673 --> 00:36:48.442
The reception is spotty but...

524
00:36:48.508 --> 00:36:50.577
I'll try to get through.

525
00:36:53.948 --> 00:36:55.282
No.

526
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:56.683
What is it?

527
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.486
Battery's low.

528
00:36:58.551 --> 00:37:00.620
Well, make this call count.

529
00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:03.090
It's ringing.

530
00:37:11.399 --> 00:37:13.434
Okay... okay.

531
00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:17.570
Oh...

532
00:37:21.509 --> 00:37:22.943
Dad?

533
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.644
Hey!

534
00:37:24.711 --> 00:37:26.546
You're back so soon, huh?

535
00:37:26.613 --> 00:37:29.283
Did the ocean run out of fish?

536
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.583
Listen.

537
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.953
There's been
a really bad accident.


538
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.687
I'm okay, but...

539
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:41.195
Two others fell off the boat

540
00:37:41.262 --> 00:37:46.633
and were eaten by sharks
and our engine just seized.


541
00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:48.869
Okay.

542
00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:52.139
Sharks...

543
00:37:52.206 --> 00:37:54.809
did you call
the Coast Guard, honey?


544
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:56.776
Our radio was damaged
during the attack.


545
00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:02.283
They won't make it
out here in time, dad.


546
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:05.419
We're dead in the water and
there are so many of them.


547
00:38:05.486 --> 00:38:06.987
There's so many sharks.

548
00:38:07.888 --> 00:38:10.458
Okay, okay, honey.
Stay calm, okay?


549
00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:14.727
I will relay the message to
my contacts down there, okay?


550
00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:17.098
What is your location?

551
00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:19.400
Uh..

552
00:38:19.467 --> 00:38:22.503
The coordinates are 22 degrees,

553
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.505
and 110 degrees, 3 and 22 north.

554
00:38:24.572 --> 00:38:25.906
Okay, okay.

555
00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:28.275
Stay on the line and

556
00:38:28.342 --> 00:38:30.643
I'm going to call my friends
on the landline...


557
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.513
Dad, I can't.
My battery is low.


558
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.081
I have to save the battery.

559
00:38:34.882 --> 00:38:37.384
Okay, so just sit tight.

560
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:38.552
I've got this.

561
00:38:38.618 --> 00:38:41.822
I'll get someone
there soon, okay?


562
00:38:46.726 --> 00:38:49.530
I've never seen
so much blood before.


563
00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:51.832
Baby, baby, it's okay.

564
00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:55.936
I'll get the Coast Guard
there soon, okay?


565
00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:58.539
Look, you're safe
on that boat


566
00:38:58.606 --> 00:39:02.476
and you are the most comfortable
when you're on the water.


567
00:39:02.543 --> 00:39:04.078
Remember that, honey.

568
00:39:05.146 --> 00:39:06.947
Yes.

569
00:39:07.915 --> 00:39:10.184
You got this, you hear?

570
00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:15.722
Okay.

571
00:39:15.788 --> 00:39:17.158
Yeah, I can do this.

572
00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:20.660
Just... please hurry, dad.

573
00:39:21.595 --> 00:39:23.430
I love you.

574
00:39:23.497 --> 00:39:25.798
I love you too, Lucia.

575
00:39:38.913 --> 00:39:40.780
Yes, hello.

576
00:39:40.848 --> 00:39:44.652
I am on land, but I am
relaying an emergency


577
00:39:44.717 --> 00:39:48.022
of a boat that is
stalled off the coast.


578
00:39:48.088 --> 00:39:49.857
Si, yes.

579
00:39:49.924 --> 00:39:54.495
And there's been two
fatalities... shark attacks.


580
00:39:55.728 --> 00:40:01.135
Could you please get me
with the Coast Guard, please?


581
00:40:01.202 --> 00:40:02.536
No, no, now!

582
00:40:02.603 --> 00:40:04.405
My daughter is in danger.

583
00:40:04.471 --> 00:40:07.608
No, no!
Don't put me on hold, please!


584
00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:10.144
You...!

585
00:40:12.613 --> 00:40:14.848
Oh...

586
00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:34.335
He's calling the Coast Guard.

587
00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:37.204
Someone will be here soon.

588
00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:40.773
How does that engine look?

589
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:42.742
Bad news, cap.

590
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.777
We got a few stripped gears.

591
00:40:45.946 --> 00:40:48.482
A little bit of a burnout,
but it's not fatal.


592
00:40:48.549 --> 00:40:51.051
I'm doubtful we can get
it up and running, though,


593
00:40:51.118 --> 00:40:53.387
without a total overhaul.

594
00:40:53.454 --> 00:40:57.057
Best to let it rest and
not risk a total flame-out.


595
00:40:57.124 --> 00:40:59.693
See what you can do
to get us going.


596
00:40:59.759 --> 00:41:01.362
Aye, aye, Cap.

597
00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:14.808
Okay, my daughter is out there.

598
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.076
Sir, we're getting someone

599
00:41:16.143 --> 00:41:17.878
as soon as we can, okay?

600
00:41:17.945 --> 00:41:19.380
Okay, please hurry.

601
00:41:40.668 --> 00:41:45.973
So I said, "Wrecked 'em?
Damn near killed 'em!"


602
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.841
That gets funnier
every time you tell it.


603
00:41:47.908 --> 00:41:49.543
Hey, come on,.
That's a classic.


604
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.846
Try to get a new joke, Captain.

605
00:41:52.913 --> 00:41:54.882
Your phone's buzzing.

606
00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.318
Jose, old barnacle!

607
00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:58.852
When are you
gonna come down here?


608
00:41:58.919 --> 00:42:00.354
We'll tear up this port
like we used to.


609
00:42:00.421 --> 00:42:02.122
All right, Dan,
there's an emergency.


610
00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:05.125
Lucia took a fishing
cruise today


611
00:42:05.192 --> 00:42:08.862
and there's been
a couple fatalities.


612
00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:10.597
Is she okay?

613
00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:11.699
How can I help?

614
00:42:11.765 --> 00:42:13.767
Look, she's stranded

615
00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:17.571
and there have been some shark
attacks, a couple fatalities.


616
00:42:17.638 --> 00:42:19.106
And I called the Coast Guard,

617
00:42:19.173 --> 00:42:21.508
but God only knows when
they'll show up, right?


618
00:42:21.575 --> 00:42:23.812
Yeah, it'll be sundown
before they get there


619
00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:25.112
and that's if she's lucky.

620
00:42:25.179 --> 00:42:28.716
Is the Dew Drop up
and running yet?


621
00:42:28.782 --> 00:42:29.818
Give me a pen.

622
00:42:29.883 --> 00:42:31.552
No, no, she's in the shop.

623
00:42:31.618 --> 00:42:34.555
But I'll tell you what.
I can wrangle up something.


624
00:42:34.621 --> 00:42:37.691
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get
her on the charter myself...


625
00:42:37.758 --> 00:42:39.993
No, no, no!
Don't be sorry.


626
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.695
You can make it up to me
by getting me a boat


627
00:42:41.762 --> 00:42:42.763
as fast as you can
get me out there


628
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.198
as fast as you can, please!

629
00:42:44.264 --> 00:42:46.567
No, I'm gonna get us
out there fast, okay?


630
00:42:46.633 --> 00:42:49.636
I'm not letting you alone out
at sea with that foot of yours.


631
00:42:49.703 --> 00:42:51.472
Now give me the coordinates.

632
00:42:54.942 --> 00:42:56.477
Okay, buddy.

633
00:42:56.543 --> 00:42:59.380
I promise you I'm gonna wrangle
up something, all right?


634
00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:01.181
We're gonna
get your little girl.


635
00:43:01.248 --> 00:43:04.952
I need to warn you, my friend,
there are sharks involved.


636
00:43:06.653 --> 00:43:07.955
It's never easy, is it?

637
00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:10.591
Well, we'll just have
to leave sooner


638
00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.192
than I thought, that's all.

639
00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:14.628
It'll be impossible
to find them once the sun sets.


640
00:43:14.695 --> 00:43:17.898
Thanks, Dan.
I owe you.


641
00:43:18.565 --> 00:43:20.033
I'm on it.

642
00:43:21.268 --> 00:43:23.303
Give me another coffee,
a big one.


643
00:43:28.008 --> 00:43:30.010
Okay.

644
00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:34.948
She's gonna be okay,
por favor, Jesus.


645
00:43:35.015 --> 00:43:37.017
She's going to be okay.

646
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.598
We haven't moved
in such a long time.


647
00:43:51.665 --> 00:43:53.534
And all this blood splattered
against the boat,


648
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.068
they probably think
we're another shark


649
00:43:55.135 --> 00:43:58.572
or a whale a.k.a. dinner.

650
00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:00.774
Yeah, I'm working as
fast as I can.


651
00:44:00.842 --> 00:44:02.943
This motor is still jammed.

652
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.246
Once that sun goes down...

653
00:44:06.313 --> 00:44:08.549
I know, Cap, I know.

654
00:44:11.285 --> 00:44:13.153
How you holding up?

655
00:44:16.256 --> 00:44:18.827
Is that hand hurting you?

656
00:44:18.893 --> 00:44:20.829
Doesn't even hurt.

657
00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:23.230
I'm still running
off of adrenaline.


658
00:44:23.297 --> 00:44:25.732
I don't feel a thing.

659
00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:26.835
Good.

660
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:28.735
Adrenalin's good.

661
00:44:28.802 --> 00:44:31.738
Keeps you alert, on your toes.

662
00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:33.440
So...

663
00:44:36.878 --> 00:44:38.178
We're gonna make
it out of this.


664
00:44:40.481 --> 00:44:42.783
Got it?

665
00:44:42.851 --> 00:44:44.151
Yep.

666
00:44:44.218 --> 00:44:46.753
Yeah, I know my
dad's gonna pull through.


667
00:44:46.821 --> 00:44:48.255
We'll put through.

668
00:44:48.322 --> 00:44:49.891
And you're gonna have
one hell of a fish tale


669
00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:52.025
to tell him when you see him.

670
00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:09.911
On, no!

671
00:45:09.978 --> 00:45:12.012
We're taking in water!

672
00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:14.715
Oh my God.

673
00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:17.117
The hull can't keep taking
a beating like this, Cap.


674
00:45:17.184 --> 00:45:18.953
She'll break into pieces!

675
00:45:19.019 --> 00:45:20.687
It's just us out here!

676
00:45:20.754 --> 00:45:22.991
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for help to arrive!


677
00:45:24.959 --> 00:45:27.261
We need to find land...
and fast.


678
00:45:27.327 --> 00:45:28.795
And the wind is picking up.

679
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:30.130
We'll be blown further out soon.

680
00:45:30.197 --> 00:45:34.134
No, no, that's
actually a good thing.


681
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:35.802
We're drifting, so the wind
will point us


682
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.639
into the direction of the
sandbar that we were at earlier.


683
00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:40.774
And that should
buy us some time.


684
00:45:40.842 --> 00:45:43.076
But we're gonna have to help
this old girl along


685
00:45:43.143 --> 00:45:44.378
if we're gonna make it out.

686
00:45:59.226 --> 00:46:00.627
We're gonna have to move!

687
00:46:00.694 --> 00:46:02.997
She's not gonna be
seaworthy much longer!


688
00:46:03.063 --> 00:46:05.065
Can we use the oars to paddle?

689
00:46:05.132 --> 00:46:06.199
We'll have to try.

690
00:46:06.266 --> 00:46:07.936
You start paddling.

691
00:46:08.002 --> 00:46:09.369
Try not to provoke the sharks.

692
00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:12.040
But give 'em a good whack
if you have to.


693
00:46:12.105 --> 00:46:14.074
There it is!

694
00:46:14.141 --> 00:46:15.542
The sandbar!

695
00:46:24.018 --> 00:46:27.922
Put your backs into it, people!

696
00:46:27.989 --> 00:46:29.790
Keep on paddling!

697
00:46:29.857 --> 00:46:32.192
We're almost to the sandbar!

698
00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:46.273
Aye, aye, Captain!

699
00:46:53.213 --> 00:46:54.548
We hit ground!

700
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.554
Nice job, crew.

701
00:47:03.523 --> 00:47:05.592
So I don't think
we're gonna sink for a bit.


702
00:47:09.097 --> 00:47:10.731
Thanks, Cap.

703
00:47:10.797 --> 00:47:12.834
I think it'll be too shallow
for the sharks here,


704
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.937
but they are smart creatures,
so we need to be careful.


705
00:47:16.004 --> 00:47:19.706
But we've only bought ourselves,
you know, a little bit of time.


706
00:47:19.773 --> 00:47:23.343
We're already on
the high end of an ebb and flow.


707
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:33.654
It doesn't seem
like they're leaving.


708
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.824
We can only hope that they
get bored, but I doubt it.


709
00:47:36.891 --> 00:47:39.359
We're gonna be easy pickings
at high tide.


710
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:44.464
There...

711
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:45.599
There.

712
00:47:45.666 --> 00:47:47.068
It's a boat!

713
00:47:47.135 --> 00:47:48.435
Our luck's 'turned around!

714
00:47:49.971 --> 00:47:51.538
Hey!

715
00:47:53.074 --> 00:47:54.976
Hey!

716
00:47:55.043 --> 00:47:56.710
Help!

717
00:48:00.213 --> 00:48:04.685
Hey! Help, over here!

718
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.424
Help!
Over here!


719
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.493
The sky's too bright.
They can't see the flare.


720
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.431
They can't hear us either.
Engine's too loud.


721
00:48:18.231 --> 00:48:21.936
Hey!
Over here!


722
00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:23.838
Hey!

723
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.180
Hurry, stand up!

724
00:48:32.245 --> 00:48:33.647
You can stand on the sandbar!

725
00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:36.450
Mayday!

726
00:48:36.516 --> 00:48:38.552
Can anyone hear me?

727
00:48:38.618 --> 00:48:40.220
Mayday!

728
00:48:53.533 --> 00:48:56.104
-Shatto!
-Lucia!


729
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.537
Come here!

730
00:48:58.305 --> 00:49:00.707
-Lucia!
-Shatto!


731
00:49:00.774 --> 00:49:02.576
I'm coming!

732
00:49:33.507 --> 00:49:36.309
Come on, baby.
Come on.


733
00:49:36.376 --> 00:49:37.845
Watch her legs.

734
00:49:39.513 --> 00:49:41.849
Come on, move, Shatto!
I got you!


735
00:49:49.056 --> 00:49:50.357
We're gonna have to put

736
00:49:50.423 --> 00:49:53.293
a tourniquet on
this wound, pronto!


737
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.695
How bad is it?

738
00:49:57.297 --> 00:49:58.532
I'm not gonna lie to you, kid.

739
00:49:58.598 --> 00:50:00.634
Getting bit by
a shark is not good.


740
00:50:02.804 --> 00:50:04.638
It hurts.

741
00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:09.309
Tell me...tell me something.

742
00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:11.545
Listen to me, listen to me.

743
00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:14.215
Eyes up here to me!
Eyes up here to me!


744
00:50:14.282 --> 00:50:15.283
Eyes up here to me, kid.

745
00:50:15.348 --> 00:50:18.052
Tell me something.

746
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.352
Why do you like to fish?

747
00:50:20.288 --> 00:50:22.023
Wh-what?

748
00:50:22.089 --> 00:50:24.192
Why do you like to fish, Lucia?

749
00:50:24.258 --> 00:50:25.759
Why do you like to fish?

750
00:50:28.562 --> 00:50:32.900
Because it's as simple
as life can get for you.


751
00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:36.037
It's, uh... oh!

752
00:50:36.103 --> 00:50:38.505
Yeah, come on.
Come on, baby girl, come on.


753
00:50:38.572 --> 00:50:41.575
It's...it's one person

754
00:50:41.641 --> 00:50:45.612
and one fish with a
thin line between you.


755
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:50.650
And sometimes...

756
00:50:50.717 --> 00:50:54.454
you make that cast
and you make that connection


757
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:58.860
and sometimes you don't.

758
00:50:58.926 --> 00:51:01.761
There's no wiggle
room in between.


759
00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:07.935
Life doesn't...

760
00:51:08.002 --> 00:51:11.404
Life doesn't really offer up
that many absolutes like that.


761
00:51:11.471 --> 00:51:13.341
Yeah, I like that.

762
00:51:13.406 --> 00:51:19.613
It's like you get the fish or
the fish gets you, right?


763
00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:23.851
Plus, it give me more time
to spend with my dad.


764
00:51:27.221 --> 00:51:29.156
Come on, come on!

765
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:34.195
When...

766
00:51:34.262 --> 00:51:40.268
After my mom passed, we both
felt like were on borrowed time.


767
00:51:41.135 --> 00:51:44.437
And we were terrified
that something


768
00:51:44.504 --> 00:51:46.573
would just come along
and tear us apart.


769
00:51:48.342 --> 00:51:49.844
Yeah, yeah.

770
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:52.113
I actually lost my mother
when I was young, too.


771
00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:54.849
And it's not something you
ever really get over.


772
00:51:58.618 --> 00:51:59.653
I can't die out here.

773
00:51:59.719 --> 00:52:01.322
No, no, no, no.

774
00:52:01.389 --> 00:52:02.622
I can't leave my dad alone.

775
00:52:02.689 --> 00:52:04.658
No, no, not today,
kid, not today.


776
00:52:04.724 --> 00:52:06.260
You're not dying on me,
not today.


777
00:52:06.327 --> 00:52:08.229
It's not gonna happen, okay?

778
00:52:08.296 --> 00:52:11.464
You'll be fishing with
your father again real soon.


779
00:52:12.867 --> 00:52:14.335
Hey, hey.

780
00:52:14.402 --> 00:52:17.204
It just mouthed you,
Lucia, okay?


781
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:18.605
Barely a bite.

782
00:52:20.274 --> 00:52:21.809
You hear that?

783
00:52:21.876 --> 00:52:23.911
Just took a little gnaw at you,
just a little gnaw.


784
00:52:26.013 --> 00:52:28.481
Even though,
a little bite from a shark


785
00:52:28.548 --> 00:52:30.418
is still a pretty big bite.

786
00:52:30.483 --> 00:52:32.519
Not helping, Shatto.

787
00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:37.657
You must taste like crap, kid.

788
00:52:37.724 --> 00:52:40.361
He took a bite out of you
and just spit you right out.


789
00:52:40.428 --> 00:52:43.064
There's so much blood, though.

790
00:52:44.698 --> 00:52:48.568
I wanna call my dad.
I wanna call my dad.


791
00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:51.072
Just sit up.
Sit up.


792
00:52:55.843 --> 00:52:56.643
No!

793
00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:00.147
My phone is missing!

794
00:53:00.214 --> 00:53:02.716
My bag must have been torn,
it's ruined.


795
00:53:02.782 --> 00:53:05.853
Come on, sit back, sit back.

796
00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:17.697
I can't die out here.

797
00:53:18.866 --> 00:53:20.734
I need you to breathe.

798
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.305
Don't over exert yourself.

799
00:53:24.372 --> 00:53:26.474
I need you to breathe.
I need you to breathe.


800
00:53:26.539 --> 00:53:28.242
Come on, breathe.

801
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:30.077
There you go.

802
00:53:32.146 --> 00:53:35.016
She's gonna go into shock.
We can't lose her.


803
00:53:35.082 --> 00:53:37.151
She's a soldier.

804
00:53:37.218 --> 00:53:39.286
She's not gonna make
it much longer, man,


805
00:53:39.353 --> 00:53:41.222
if we don't hurry
to get her help.


806
00:53:41.288 --> 00:53:43.690
We got about a couple of hours.

807
00:53:43.757 --> 00:53:45.092
Yeah, that's a lot of blood.

808
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:48.561
Just need you to keep
the tourniquet tight


809
00:53:48.628 --> 00:53:50.031
and make sure
it doesn't loosen up.


810
00:53:50.097 --> 00:53:53.566
All Right. I'll do what
I can to keep her awake.


811
00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:55.036
Thank you.

812
00:53:55.102 --> 00:53:58.005
Time is really working
against us.


813
00:54:54.727 --> 00:54:58.299
S.O.S. from a fishing vessel,
shark attack, two casualties.


814
00:54:58.365 --> 00:54:59.333
Copy.

815
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.633
Where's the vessel?

816
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.103
What's your location?

817
00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:03.670
Officer Fuentes told us
to reach out to you


818
00:55:03.736 --> 00:55:05.139
for possible assistance.

819
00:55:05.206 --> 00:55:07.640
Well, a couple of miles
south of Cabo San Lucas.


820
00:55:07.707 --> 00:55:09.243
Scanning the shoreline
for sharks.


821
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:10.511
I'm already following
one shiver.


822
00:55:10.578 --> 00:55:11.912
Where do you need me to be?

823
00:55:11.979 --> 00:55:13.646
Should get a visual
on them shortly.


824
00:55:13.713 --> 00:55:16.183
Then we'll give you
exact coordinates.


825
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.519
Roger that.
Keep me posted.


826
00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:19.887
Stay safe.

827
00:55:22.755 --> 00:55:24.258
All right.

828
00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:27.294
I need everyone to contact
every vessel they can.


829
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:31.265
Find out if anybody saw anything
regarding that jet ski attack.


830
00:55:31.332 --> 00:55:34.902
And find out if anybody knows
anything about the Jubilation.


831
00:55:41.475 --> 00:55:42.977
Come on, Lucia!

832
00:55:44.478 --> 00:55:45.946
See anything?

833
00:55:46.013 --> 00:55:48.382
No.

834
00:55:48.449 --> 00:55:49.917
It's clear seas.

835
00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:54.989
Can't this thing
go any faster, Dan?


836
00:55:55.055 --> 00:55:58.392
It's all I could get
on such short notice.


837
00:55:58.459 --> 00:56:00.793
It's not a speedster,
but it floats.


838
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.332
Well, look at that!

839
00:56:05.399 --> 00:56:06.967
It looks like the Guard's have
finally gotten off their butts


840
00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:10.104
and doing their job!

841
00:56:10.171 --> 00:56:12.705
TK-421.

842
00:56:18.179 --> 00:56:20.381
TK-421!

843
00:56:28.255 --> 00:56:30.658
TK-421!

844
00:56:52.779 --> 00:56:55.149
Didn't they send a chopper?

845
00:57:25.112 --> 00:57:27.715
Try to catch up with them!

846
00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.617
I'll try. They're a heck
of a lot faster


847
00:57:29.683 --> 00:57:31.452
than this old floater.

848
00:57:31.518 --> 00:57:33.454
Good news that the
Guard's out looking for 'em.


849
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.989
Si.

850
00:57:35.055 --> 00:57:37.091
We're gonna find her, my friend.

851
00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:41.794
I can't keep up with them,

852
00:57:41.862 --> 00:57:44.298
but eventually we'll
catch up to 'em.


853
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.737
Thank you, Dan.

854
00:57:49.802 --> 00:57:52.072
I appreciate you doing this.

855
00:57:52.139 --> 00:57:54.942
I owe you one, my friend.

856
00:57:55.009 --> 00:57:56.744
Hey, you and your daughter
just have dinner with me


857
00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:58.078
when this is all over.

858
00:57:58.145 --> 00:57:59.680
And then we'll call
it even, right?


859
00:57:59.747 --> 00:58:01.382
You got yourself a deal.

860
00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:04.952
She's gonna be okay, my friend.

861
00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:09.957
Eventually the tide
will get high enough


862
00:58:10.024 --> 00:58:11.759
to pull us off the reef.

863
00:58:11.825 --> 00:58:14.528
We don't have much time before
the boat starts to sink again.


864
00:58:14.595 --> 00:58:16.063
How's Lucia?

865
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.698
She's good.

866
00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:21.101
She's stopped bleeding for now.
Her color's coming back.


867
00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:22.169
You know I can hear you.

868
00:58:22.236 --> 00:58:25.139
Man, stop being a big ass baby.

869
00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:26.940
You're going to
run out of bandages, you know.


870
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:30.644
Got plenty.

871
00:58:30.711 --> 00:58:33.047
But you are gonna be
looking like a few mummies


872
00:58:33.113 --> 00:58:34.882
in a little while.

873
00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:42.122
Lucia, wake up, please.

874
00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:45.225
Can't have you falling asleep
until we get some help.


875
00:58:50.397 --> 00:58:52.132
You okay?

876
00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:55.002
Um, yeah.

877
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:56.670
Actually, I'm the only one

878
00:58:56.737 --> 00:58:59.907
that's not cut up
or bit, aren't I?


879
00:58:59.973 --> 00:59:01.408
Yeah, but you should rest.

880
00:59:01.475 --> 00:59:03.077
I mean, you're taking
care of everybody.


881
00:59:03.143 --> 00:59:06.046
It's the captain's job,
my friend.


882
00:59:08.749 --> 00:59:10.984
Hey!

883
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:13.721
Get up! We can't have you
falling asleep, Lucia.


884
00:59:13.787 --> 00:59:15.322
On your feet, soldier.

885
00:59:18.392 --> 00:59:19.893
On your feet!

886
00:59:23.097 --> 00:59:25.532
Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up.

887
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:28.035
Try not to put any
weight on your leg.


888
00:59:28.102 --> 00:59:30.771
You can prop it up
if you need to, okay?


889
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:34.074
I'm gonna go below deck to see
if I can find something to help.


890
00:59:38.512 --> 00:59:40.948
You care about
him a lot, don't you?


891
00:59:42.249 --> 00:59:44.585
Yeah.

892
00:59:44.651 --> 00:59:49.390
When I first came here from
Hawaii, I didn't know anybody.


893
00:59:49.456 --> 00:59:53.660
Captain took me in when nobody
else would, gave me a job,


894
00:59:53.727 --> 00:59:55.129
taught me all about this boat,

895
00:59:55.195 --> 00:59:56.997
and gave my life purpose

896
00:59:57.064 --> 00:59:58.932
when it didn't have any.

897
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.369
Kind of like you said.

898
01:00:03.872 --> 01:00:05.973
Life doesn't give
you many absolutes.


899
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:09.243
So the captain
is your absolute.


900
01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:15.949
Well, I absolutely
wouldn't be here without him,


901
01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:19.019
for better or worse.

902
01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:23.157
He helped me, so I'd
do anything to help him.


903
01:00:23.223 --> 01:00:25.827
If you sad sacks
stop talking about me,


904
01:00:25.894 --> 01:00:28.629
maybe I can give you
a perfect update.


905
01:00:28.695 --> 01:00:33.634
Water's filling up
quickly below in the deck.


906
01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.104
This means that we have to
jump on the offense situation.


907
01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:40.474
Now these sharks
are beautiful creatures.


908
01:00:42.509 --> 01:00:43.878
Massive monsters,

909
01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:48.515
who survived on sheer grit
throughout the millennium.


910
01:00:48.582 --> 01:00:51.652
As much as I know
that we like to marvel


911
01:00:51.718 --> 01:00:54.388
at these perfect relics
in their natural habitat,


912
01:00:54.455 --> 01:00:57.124
we gotta realize that
they're trying to end us.


913
01:00:57.191 --> 01:01:02.496
Now, personally, I'm not
trying to get ended yet.


914
01:01:02.563 --> 01:01:06.400
Now we don't know when
the Coast Guard is coming.


915
01:01:06.467 --> 01:01:09.136
So we have to do something.

916
01:01:10.872 --> 01:01:12.673
So we fight back.

917
01:01:12.739 --> 01:01:14.909
Exactly.

918
01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:16.610
Now the water's still shallow,

919
01:01:16.677 --> 01:01:19.279
so that means we'll see the
sharks when they get close.


920
01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:23.517
Now when they do,
we let 'em have it.


921
01:01:24.853 --> 01:01:27.254
You use that thing
a lot out on the ocean?


922
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:29.256
What? This right here?

923
01:01:29.323 --> 01:01:31.558
More than you know.

924
01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:34.595
Used for customers
who don't pay me.


925
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:40.234
Don't worry.
Your credit card went through.


926
01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.143
I got one!

927
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.545
Starboard side!

928
01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:57.518
Come on, what
are you waiting for?


929
01:02:01.121 --> 01:02:02.556
Ah...

930
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:10.464
Better be careful!
Those aren't dolphins!


931
01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:12.165
Come on, come on.

932
01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.335
Shatto, watch out!

933
01:02:26.146 --> 01:02:28.181
-That's my first mate.
-Yes, sir.


934
01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:37.057
Yeah. Great job, crew, but
the tide is still rising fast.


935
01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:39.192
We're still taking in water

936
01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:41.029
and we still haven't
gotten any help.


937
01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:43.965
So we're not out
of the hot water yet.


938
01:02:44.032 --> 01:02:47.167
Lucia, you definitely
need some medical attention


939
01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:48.569
as soon as possible.

940
01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:50.838
I'll be fine.

941
01:02:50.905 --> 01:02:52.205
Lucia? Lucia!

942
01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:54.909
-Lucia!
-Lucia, wake up!


943
01:02:54.976 --> 01:02:56.176
Wake up, kid!

944
01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:58.445
We can't let her go into shock!

945
01:03:04.986 --> 01:03:09.423
The tourniquet is still
holding, she should be good.


946
01:03:11.124 --> 01:03:13.627
Lucia, wake up, kid.

947
01:03:16.597 --> 01:03:17.664
Wake up.

948
01:03:18.665 --> 01:03:20.068
Lucia?

949
01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.335
Lucia!

950
01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:22.971
Lucia, wake up!

951
01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:24.204
Wake up, kid.

952
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.139
Lucia?
Wake up, kid.


953
01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:30.477
You fainted on me, kid.

954
01:03:30.544 --> 01:03:33.081
I did?

955
01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:35.215
Yeah, too much excitement,
I guess.


956
01:03:35.282 --> 01:03:37.885
It's okay,
I'm good, I'm good.


957
01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:39.753
Here.
Take a swig of this.


958
01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:42.023
Fighting off hungry sharks
can make you thirsty.


959
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:44.658
I'm gonna go clean some
shark blood off of the boat.


960
01:03:57.704 --> 01:03:59.539
Get off!

961
01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:07.481
Give it back!

962
01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:15.355
Give it back!

963
01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:16.991
He's gonna yank you under

964
01:04:17.058 --> 01:04:18.926
if you don't just drop
that bucket in the water.


965
01:04:18.993 --> 01:04:20.360
Yah!

966
01:04:25.133 --> 01:04:26.767
I hate these sharks!

967
01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:35.409
Once the water
lifts us off the sandbar,


968
01:04:35.475 --> 01:04:37.444
we'll be targets again.

969
01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:41.082
We'll float a bit, but we're
taking in so much water


970
01:04:41.149 --> 01:04:42.449
that those sharks
will practically be able


971
01:04:42.516 --> 01:04:44.217
to jump on the boat with us.

972
01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:46.319
It's just a matter of time.

973
01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:53.193
Am I dreaming or is that a boat?

974
01:04:55.762 --> 01:04:57.698
That's a boat.

975
01:04:57.764 --> 01:04:59.599
The Coast Guard.

976
01:05:04.172 --> 01:05:06.773
Hey!
S.O.S.! Over here!


977
01:05:19.821 --> 01:05:20.487
Over here!

978
01:05:20.554 --> 01:05:21.655
-Help!
-Hey!


979
01:05:21.722 --> 01:05:23.991
Over here!

980
01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:26.393
-Hey, over here!
-Over here, help!


981
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.196
Hey, over here!

982
01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:38.538
Hey, I think we're saved!

983
01:05:38.605 --> 01:05:39.941
I think we're saved!

984
01:06:13.941 --> 01:06:16.144
Go grab your stuff!
Lucia, grab your stuff!


985
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.778
Shatto, just grab
the essentials!


986
01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:19.013
Yes, yes!

987
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.849
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

988
01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:24.384
That doesn't look like any Coast
Guard vessel I've ever seen.


989
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:27.188
What?
It's got to be.


990
01:06:27.255 --> 01:06:29.589
Well, you're right.

991
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:32.492
It's definitely
not the Coast Guard.


992
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.628
I don't care who it is.
We're saved.


993
01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:38.498
Wait a second.

994
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.137
That's...

995
01:06:43.204 --> 01:06:45.039
That's my dad!

996
01:06:45.106 --> 01:06:48.176
That's my dad! Dad!

997
01:06:48.242 --> 01:06:49.911
That's them!

998
01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:58.920
Chopper One, do you copy?

999
01:06:58.986 --> 01:07:00.620
Go for Chopper One.

1000
01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:04.491
TK-421 is having trouble
locating the vessel.


1001
01:07:04.558 --> 01:07:06.359
Do a perimeter search
five miles out


1002
01:07:06.426 --> 01:07:08.062
and see if you
can spot anything.


1003
01:07:08.129 --> 01:07:10.797
Roger that, Office Fuentes.
I'm on my way.


1004
01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:15.236
Did you get a call sign
or a name of the vessel?


1005
01:07:15.303 --> 01:07:16.336
We did.

1006
01:07:16.403 --> 01:07:17.905
The initial report says...

1007
01:07:17.972 --> 01:07:20.842
and we just confirmed...
it's called the Jubilation.


1008
01:07:20.908 --> 01:07:23.811
-The Jubilation?
-That's correct.


1009
01:07:23.878 --> 01:07:25.213
Are you sure?

1010
01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:27.514
100%. Why?

1011
01:07:27.581 --> 01:07:29.449
I was on that boat
a couple of weeks ago.


1012
01:07:29.516 --> 01:07:31.886
I caught the biggest fish.

1013
01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:34.255
All the more reason for
you to find that vessel.


1014
01:07:34.322 --> 01:07:36.023
With food harder to find,

1015
01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:39.392
those sharks won't hesitate
to attack a boat full of fish.


1016
01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:41.394
I'll search as fast as I can.

1017
01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:43.331
All right, good.

1018
01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:44.932
You update me if
you find anything.


1019
01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:48.269
And Davila,
didn't know you fished.


1020
01:07:48.336 --> 01:07:49.837
You never asked.

1021
01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:52.940
I go out with Captain Banning
a few times a year.


1022
01:07:53.007 --> 01:07:55.609
I just don't know why
it had to be the Jubilation.


1023
01:07:55.675 --> 01:07:57.078
I mean, Banning's one of

1024
01:07:57.144 --> 01:07:59.080
the most respectful
captains out there.


1025
01:07:59.146 --> 01:08:00.480
Really?

1026
01:08:00.547 --> 01:08:02.250
Like he even took
in his first mate


1027
01:08:02.316 --> 01:08:03.617
when he had nowhere else to go.

1028
01:08:03.683 --> 01:08:05.086
Man, I hope he's okay out there.

1029
01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:07.154
Do you have any idea
where he could be?


1030
01:08:07.221 --> 01:08:09.957
Anything at all that could
help us locate that vessel?


1031
01:08:10.024 --> 01:08:12.726
Well, normally, Banning
sticks closer to the shore.


1032
01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:15.395
But the fish are moving out
further out these days.


1033
01:08:15.462 --> 01:08:18.165
So this one time,
he took us to the sandbar.


1034
01:08:18.232 --> 01:08:21.035
Man, the fish were
jumping into the boat.


1035
01:08:21.102 --> 01:08:23.637
It was like... that was
the best day of my life.


1036
01:08:23.703 --> 01:08:25.705
Do you remember
where this sandbar is?


1037
01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:28.376
I know exactly where
that sandbar is.


1038
01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:29.877
Heading that way now.

1039
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:38.585
Lucia!

1040
01:08:38.652 --> 01:08:40.453
-Dad!
-Lucia!


1041
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.522
Dad!

1042
01:08:42.589 --> 01:08:44.158
They don't know
about the sandbar.


1043
01:08:44.225 --> 01:08:45.393
Over here!

1044
01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:48.195
Lucia, are you guys okay?

1045
01:08:48.262 --> 01:08:51.198
Stop!

1046
01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:53.700
There's a sandbar over there!

1047
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:56.469
Oh, no. Dad, please stop!

1048
01:08:56.536 --> 01:08:57.570
Dad, please stop!

1049
01:08:57.637 --> 01:09:00.473
I think they want us to stop.

1050
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.741
Why stop?

1051
01:09:01.809 --> 01:09:03.311
Stop the boat!
Stop the boat!


1052
01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:04.946
Watch out, brother!

1053
01:09:05.012 --> 01:09:06.948
Some extremely
hostile sharks over here!


1054
01:09:09.817 --> 01:09:13.220
The first thing I need
to know, are you okay?


1055
01:09:13.287 --> 01:09:15.089
We have one severely injured!

1056
01:09:15.156 --> 01:09:18.426
We need to get her some medical
assistance in the boat ASAP!


1057
01:09:18.491 --> 01:09:21.628
Dad, I'm okay!
Dad, I'm okay!


1058
01:09:21.695 --> 01:09:26.267
Lucia, baby
why are you bleeding?


1059
01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:27.801
She's okay!

1060
01:09:27.868 --> 01:09:30.371
She just needs medical attention
to get in the boat!


1061
01:09:30.438 --> 01:09:31.571
Dad, I'm okay!

1062
01:09:31.638 --> 01:09:35.309
I was just bit.
I'm fine.


1063
01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:36.978
Is that Uncle Dan?

1064
01:09:37.044 --> 01:09:40.948
-Uncle Dan?
-He's a friend of my dad's.


1065
01:09:44.418 --> 01:09:45.719
Hold on, Lucia!

1066
01:09:45.785 --> 01:09:46.786
We'll be over there
in a quick minute!


1067
01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:48.222
We're coming, baby!

1068
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:49.357
No! No, Dad, no!

1069
01:09:49.423 --> 01:09:50.358
Wait!

1070
01:09:50.424 --> 01:09:51.993
If you come any closer,

1071
01:09:52.059 --> 01:09:53.294
you'll be trapped on
the sandbar just like we are!


1072
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:55.396
Dude, stop!

1073
01:09:55.463 --> 01:09:57.031
Stop or you're gonna get stuck!

1074
01:09:57.098 --> 01:09:59.400
Back off.
Okay, okay sit tight!


1075
01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:01.836
Slow down, slow down.

1076
01:10:05.239 --> 01:10:06.907
Why are they so aggressive?

1077
01:10:06.974 --> 01:10:10.510
These waters... they've been
chummed up by some dead sharks!


1078
01:10:10.577 --> 01:10:12.779
Dad, they've already
eaten two people


1079
01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:14.348
and they're still hungry, okay?

1080
01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:15.749
They won't leave us alone!

1081
01:10:15.816 --> 01:10:17.284
You gotta get us out of here!

1082
01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:18.819
Okay, okay!

1083
01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.620
Just hold on and let me see
what we got in the boat!


1084
01:10:20.687 --> 01:10:24.358
What do we got, Danny?
Do we have something?


1085
01:10:24.425 --> 01:10:26.494
What do we got in here, Dan?

1086
01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:27.495
We got this!

1087
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.763
Okay! Okay.

1088
01:10:31.698 --> 01:10:33.566
I'm going to throw you this rope

1089
01:10:33.633 --> 01:10:37.004
and you tie it
to the bow, okay?


1090
01:10:37.872 --> 01:10:40.740
And we pull you off the sandbar!

1091
01:10:42.076 --> 01:10:44.512
Got it!

1092
01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:45.880
Attaboy.

1093
01:10:46.646 --> 01:10:47.948
Okay, tie it to the bow!

1094
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.856
How's your motor working?

1095
01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:58.859
It's dead, but if you
pull us hard enough,


1096
01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:00.727
we'll get closer to you.

1097
01:11:00.794 --> 01:11:02.329
But you gotta do it quickly

1098
01:11:02.396 --> 01:11:03.596
'cause there's a
hole in the hull


1099
01:11:03.663 --> 01:11:05.665
and we're pulling
in a lot of water!


1100
01:11:05.732 --> 01:11:09.303
Secure the rope to the boat!

1101
01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:11.671
Okay, on my signal, Dan, okay?

1102
01:11:11.738 --> 01:11:13.573
Hold tight, baby.

1103
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.076
Daddy's gonna get
you out of here.


1104
01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:16.444
Papi's coming!

1105
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:18.045
You better do it quick!

1106
01:11:18.112 --> 01:11:20.647
This boat's being held together
by a lick and a promise!


1107
01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.120
Now!

1108
01:11:33.828 --> 01:11:36.197
Come on, you little dinghy!
You can do it!


1109
01:11:38.765 --> 01:11:40.367
It's no use!

1110
01:11:40.434 --> 01:11:41.734
It's really wedged in there!

1111
01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:46.507
We've gotta get
off this boat, Dad!


1112
01:11:46.574 --> 01:11:47.674
We're too heavy!

1113
01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:51.778
I got a plan, Cap.

1114
01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:54.215
I'll jump out,
dislodge the front of the ship.


1115
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:58.886
No! Shatto, no.
That's suicide!


1116
01:11:58.953 --> 01:12:00.821
There's sharks still out there!

1117
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:03.858
No. No way.

1118
01:12:03.924 --> 01:12:05.526
We've lost too much today.

1119
01:12:05.593 --> 01:12:06.927
And I'm not losing you, brother.

1120
01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:09.096
There's gotta be another option.

1121
01:12:10.464 --> 01:12:11.764
You know there isn't.

1122
01:12:11.832 --> 01:12:13.400
Shatto, I can't ask you to...

1123
01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:16.636
I'm gonna do it whether you give
me permission or not, Captain.


1124
01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:21.609
Look, the boat will be
lighter with me off it anyway.


1125
01:12:21.674 --> 01:12:24.979
And, look, you can distract them
on the other side with this.


1126
01:12:30.217 --> 01:12:31.751
All right.

1127
01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:33.786
We'll use both.

1128
01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:37.625
It might work,
but you better move fast.


1129
01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:39.792
Aye, aye, Captain.

1130
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.562
You hear me?

1131
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:43.430
And I do mean fast!

1132
01:12:45.566 --> 01:12:46.867
Aye, captain.

1133
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.285
What's going on?

1134
01:13:05.653 --> 01:13:07.988
We've got a plan!

1135
01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:10.991
Just make sure when
I give you the signal,


1136
01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:12.826
you fire up your engine!

1137
01:13:17.932 --> 01:13:20.467
Trust me, captain.

1138
01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:21.768
I can do this.

1139
01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:26.473
That's my little girl
over there!


1140
01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.842
Hey, it's gonna work, buddy.

1141
01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:33.847
You ready for one last cast?

1142
01:13:33.914 --> 01:13:35.816
I'm ready.

1143
01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:37.851
Okay, Shatto. Ready!

1144
01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:47.261
Hey!

1145
01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:05.279
Come on!

1146
01:14:06.547 --> 01:14:07.715
Come on!

1147
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.216
Don't fall apart on us now!

1148
01:14:09.283 --> 01:14:10.918
Come on!

1149
01:14:14.388 --> 01:14:17.891
Better make it quick, Shatto!
We're running out of fish!


1150
01:14:19.059 --> 01:14:22.263
Pull! Pull!
We got you, hold on!


1151
01:14:22.329 --> 01:14:23.731
We got you.

1152
01:14:33.107 --> 01:14:35.609
Keep going!
We're almost there!


1153
01:14:35.676 --> 01:14:38.812
It's working.
We're moving!


1154
01:14:38.879 --> 01:14:40.314
It's working!

1155
01:14:43.017 --> 01:14:45.753
Okay! Come on!
Get back here!


1156
01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:48.055
-Move!
-Come on! Come on, Shatto!


1157
01:14:56.363 --> 01:14:57.898
Move, Shatto!

1158
01:14:57.965 --> 01:15:00.834
-Shatto, come on!
-Just move!


1159
01:15:00.901 --> 01:15:03.003
Don't look back! Move!

1160
01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.148
Shatto!

1161
01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:16.050
No, Banning, I cannot
lose you, either.


1162
01:15:16.116 --> 01:15:18.319
-Shatto!
-Banning, no!


1163
01:15:18.385 --> 01:15:22.289
-No!
-Shatto!


1164
01:15:24.925 --> 01:15:26.794
Come on, you know we
have to keep moving.


1165
01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:28.829
-Okay, you know it.
-Shatto...


1166
01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:30.364
Hey, hey.

1167
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:33.267
Banning, you know we have to get
off this boat, okay?


1168
01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:34.568
We have to go.

1169
01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:36.236
Okay.. okay.

1170
01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.716
Come on.
I got you, baby girl.


1171
01:15:48.782 --> 01:15:49.750
Come on.

1172
01:15:49.818 --> 01:15:51.885
Hold on one second!

1173
01:15:51.952 --> 01:15:54.221
I'm coming, Lucia!
I'm coming, baby!


1174
01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:55.389
Come on!

1175
01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:57.925
-We're out of time here!
-Come on.


1176
01:15:59.927 --> 01:16:01.695
I got you, I got you.

1177
01:16:01.762 --> 01:16:03.430
Banning, come on!

1178
01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:08.936
This is my boat!
I choose how it goes down!


1179
01:16:10.204 --> 01:16:13.340
Captain Banning, just leave it,
just let it go!


1180
01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:17.611
Yeah, you want this boat?

1181
01:16:17.678 --> 01:16:18.946
Come chew on this!

1182
01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:27.888
Come on!

1183
01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:31.792
Danny! Danny!

1184
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.994
Help! Uncle Dan!

1185
01:16:41.668 --> 01:16:42.803
Oh my God!

1186
01:16:42.871 --> 01:16:44.438
-No! Uncle Dan!
-He's gone!


1187
01:16:44.505 --> 01:16:47.207
Lucia, he's gone!
Honey, he's gone, baby.


1188
01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:49.009
Come back here.
Come back here.


1189
01:16:49.076 --> 01:16:51.378
Come back here.

1190
01:16:54.014 --> 01:16:57.918
Banning, get your butt in here!

1191
01:16:57.985 --> 01:17:00.621
Banning! Come here!

1192
01:17:00.687 --> 01:17:02.289
Wait! Give me my tackle box!

1193
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:09.196
Go on!

1194
01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:11.900
Get in here!

1195
01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:14.067
Wait, my leg.

1196
01:17:14.134 --> 01:17:16.570
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?


1197
01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:19.406
Matches. I need matches!
I need matches!


1198
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:21.208
I quit smoking.

1199
01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:26.280
-Will this do?
-Atta girl!


1200
01:17:28.248 --> 01:17:30.350
You're gonna have
to drive, hon.


1201
01:17:38.025 --> 01:17:40.093
30 years we were together!

1202
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.095
To the Jubilation!

1203
01:17:42.897 --> 01:17:44.398
Goodbye, girl!

1204
01:18:00.815 --> 01:18:02.115
Thank you, Danny.

1205
01:18:12.894 --> 01:18:14.995
Whoa.
Come in, Officer Fuentes.


1206
01:18:15.062 --> 01:18:16.129
There's been an explosion.

1207
01:18:16.196 --> 01:18:17.564
Copy that.

1208
01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:19.633
Can you get close enough
to find any survivors?


1209
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.036
It's almost impossible to see
anything through the smoke.


1210
01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:25.038
I might have to circle
down a little bit lower.


1211
01:18:25.105 --> 01:18:26.808
You wait as long as you need to.

1212
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:30.277
We can't leave until we know
for sure one way or the other.


1213
01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:32.613
Roger.

1214
01:18:35.749 --> 01:18:38.085
You're all right, baby.
Get ready.


1215
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:46.493
The smoke is too thick.
I'm gonna have to circle back.


1216
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.396
Do two more pass throughs
and then we'll call it.


1217
01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:51.031
Copy.

1218
01:18:51.966 --> 01:18:54.735
Come on, Banning.
Where are you?


1219
01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:56.270
Come on.

1220
01:18:56.336 --> 01:18:58.472
We'll find him.
Don't worry.


1221
01:18:58.539 --> 01:18:59.706
We have to.

1222
01:18:59.773 --> 01:19:01.675
Banning can't be gone,
not like this.


1223
01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:05.746
Look, I never told
you, but after my divorce,


1224
01:19:05.813 --> 01:19:07.180
I was in pretty bad shape.

1225
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:10.584
I'd work, come home, that's it.
Just work.


1226
01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:13.821
I even canceled
my fishing trips.


1227
01:19:13.888 --> 01:19:18.826
But Banning... he found out
where I live, came to my house.


1228
01:19:18.893 --> 01:19:21.029
He refused to leave until

1229
01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:22.830
I agreed to go fishing
with him again.


1230
01:19:22.897 --> 01:19:25.967
I'm sorry.
I just can't give up on this.


1231
01:19:26.034 --> 01:19:28.836
I gotta find him.

1232
01:19:28.903 --> 01:19:30.470
Well, keep looking.

1233
01:19:30.537 --> 01:19:33.440
We won't call it in either
way until we know for sure.


1234
01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:35.542
Thank you.

1235
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:40.614
There's gotta be
something we're missing.


1236
01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:45.185
Wait.

1237
01:19:45.252 --> 01:19:46.988
I think I see something.

1238
01:19:47.055 --> 01:19:48.555
It's a life raft!

1239
01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:50.257
Are you sure?

1240
01:19:50.324 --> 01:19:52.060
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

1241
01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:53.962
Yeah, that's it!

1242
01:19:54.028 --> 01:19:56.263
-Hey!
-Yes, it is!


1243
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.332
It looks like
Banning's with them.


1244
01:19:58.398 --> 01:20:00.868
We got 'em! We got 'em!
That's them!


1245
01:20:00.935 --> 01:20:03.004
That is great news, officer.

1246
01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:05.606
Get TK-421 on and let them know.

1247
01:20:05.672 --> 01:20:07.140
Copy.

1248
01:20:07.207 --> 01:20:09.209
Tango
-Kelo 421, do you copy?

1249
01:20:09.276 --> 01:20:10.912
Go for TK-421.

1250
01:20:10.979 --> 01:20:12.179
Hey, we found the survivors.

1251
01:20:12.245 --> 01:20:13.480
Looks to be three of them.

1252
01:20:13.547 --> 01:20:15.083
And Captain Banning's
one of them.


1253
01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:16.383
Copy that.

1254
01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:19.020
I'm mounting a rescue ASAP.

1255
01:20:19.087 --> 01:20:21.755
Congratulations.

1256
01:20:21.823 --> 01:20:23.024
We found the Jubilation
and Banning


1257
01:20:23.091 --> 01:20:24.458
and the rest of the survivors.

1258
01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:26.293
Okay.

1259
01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.096
Hey, a celebration
is definitely in order


1260
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:30.364
when you get back
to the station.


1261
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.432
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.


1262
01:20:32.499 --> 01:20:34.068
Now if you'll excuse me,

1263
01:20:34.134 --> 01:20:36.904
I have to drop a ladder and
get them out of this mess.


1264
01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:39.406
Copy that.
See you soon.


1265
01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.017
-Down here!
-We're saved!


1266
01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.051
Down here!

1267
01:20:50.118 --> 01:20:52.619
Hey!

1268
01:20:52.686 --> 01:20:54.488
Yes, we are!

1269
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:58.158
Hey!

1270
01:21:07.001 --> 01:21:09.070
Hey!

1271
01:21:09.137 --> 01:21:11.139
It's okay, baby.

1272
01:21:11.204 --> 01:21:13.306
We're going home.

1273
01:21:17.344 --> 01:21:20.213
Quick, quick, come on!

1274
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.416
Okay, okay.

1275
01:21:22.482 --> 01:21:24.584
We're good, we're good.

1276
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.930
But what about the Jubilation?

1277
01:21:35.997 --> 01:21:41.334
Oh, no big deal.

1278
01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:43.303
No big deal?

1279
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:47.374
Didn't you have her
for all this time?


1280
01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:49.911
That's just what
I tell my charters.


1281
01:21:49.977 --> 01:21:54.481
Truth is, I just bought
it off eBay last year.


1282
01:21:59.053 --> 01:22:03.256
All these people... gone.

1283
01:22:03.323 --> 01:22:07.128
Wyatt...and Shatto.

1284
01:22:07.195 --> 01:22:09.563
They're all just...gone.

1285
01:22:12.265 --> 01:22:13.767
But not forgotten.

1286
01:22:14.735 --> 01:22:16.536
Si.
