00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:14.210
(dark music)

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.960
- That's a big mistake.
That's a very big mistake.


5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.300
If you ever wanna see
your mom's basement again,


6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.053
you Cheeto hacker freak,

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.470
you better start talkin'.

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.230
How did you get into the database?

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.673
Give me the codes!

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.903
Who hired you?

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.623
Tell me the name of your employer.

12
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.990
'Cause we'll beat it out of you.

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.680
I'll get names, 
I'll get dates.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.530
I'll drag anything I want out of you.

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.940
No one you're protecting is worth that.

16
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.040
So what do you say?

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.010
Are you gonna cooperate with us?

18
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.593
- Uh, okay. Um, hold on.

19
00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.860
- Was something wrong?
- No, no, it was fine.


20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.100
But could you just, you know,

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.970
add some more spice?

22
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.860
- Spice?

23
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.150
- Yeah! You know, spice it up!

24
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.320
Forget about just reciting the line.

25
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.660
- [Narrator] By now
you've probably gathered,


26
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.323
this is an audition.

27
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.360
Even good actors have bad days.

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.010
- Well, do you understand
what I'm telling you or not?


29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.900
- Yeah, no, I understand.
- Okay, so, come on.


30
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.883
Do it again.

31
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.110
- Tell me who you're working for!

32
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.310
Tell me who you're working for, now!

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.959
- Uh, uh, okay. 
All right, all right.

34
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.320
- [Casting Director] We'll be in touch.

35
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.730
- Is there anything
else you want me to do?


36
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.570
- [Filmmaker] No, we've heard enough.

37
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.403
Thank you.

38
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.893
- Okay.

39
00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:56.479
(water drips)

40
00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.229
(water splashes)

41
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:07.894
(upbeat swing music)

42
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.510
- [Narrator] Welcome to Hollywood.

43
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.570
Meet Tyler Stevens, a struggling actor.

44
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.320
He's 25 years old, which means
he's at that age where he's


45
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.860
beginning to question if it's
ever gonna happen for him.


46
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.430
He's become bitter and irritable.

47
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.900
His authentic charm is beginning to wane

48
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.930
as the fishes of doubt spider
whip through his subconscious.


49
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.690
- So what I actually ordered
was double-sided prints.


50
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.840
What you guys printed was one side.

51
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.220
There's supposed to be
a resume on the back?


52
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.800
- [Clerk] Um, okay.

53
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.580
- [Narrator] He encounters many
obstacles along his journey,


54
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490
yet he continues, nonetheless.

55
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.950
Aggressively adhering
to his health routines,


56
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.443
forced positivity, and networking.

57
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.163
- [Passenger] Are you Tyler?

58
00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:51.880
- Yeah.
- Great.


59
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.790
- [Narrator] He finds work where he can,

60
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.550
but he only takes jobs
that don't interfere


61
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.520
with his rigorous audition schedule.

62
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.840
After hundreds of cattle calls,

63
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.680
the stars are gone from his eyes.

64
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.290
Many of his peers
would've given up by now,


65
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.123
but there's something about Tyler

66
00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:05.013
that's just a little bit more stubborn.

67
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.260
- I sent you an email last week,

68
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.750
but just in case you didn't
get it, it's Tyler Stevens


69
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.750
underscore Acting at Gmail dot com.

70
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.330
- [Narrator] And who
am I you might ask?

71
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.843
A booming voice from the sky?

72
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.960
Maybe I'm his conscience.

73
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.490
A silent narrator guiding him

74
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.613
incalculably closer to his destiny.

75
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.820
Tyler Stevens first crossed my radar

76
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.920
at a local film festival last summer.

77
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.580
He had starred in
a short film that was

78
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.273
not entirely remarkable,
aside from its lead.


79
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.307
And that's where this story begins.

80
00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:45.390
(upbeat dance music)

81
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.790
- Hey, man! Glad
you're able to make it!

82
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.910
- Yeah, thanks, guy.
Thank you for the invite.


83
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.743
- Yeah.

84
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.930
- Oh and thank
you for the filmmaker pass.

85
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.940
- Yeah, absolutamente. (chuckles)

86
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.020
Anyway, I'm gonna go, uh,
mingle. Work the room.


87
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.980
I suggest you do the same.

88
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.903
Business cards and cocktails
is the name of the game.


89
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.370
- [Narrator] No, 
I'm not that guy.

90
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.120
I'm actually not any of these people.

91
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.030
I wasn't there that night.

92
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.790
But it's the short film
Tyler was in that soon came


93
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.030
to the attention of a certain
casting director in Hollywood.


94
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.973
Marcy Whitman.

95
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.490
But he didn't know that yet.

96
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.800
The truth is, no amount of networking

97
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.180
can out-compete sheer happenstance.

98
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.613
The collision of talent and luck.

99
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.730
Speaking of networking...

100
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.953
- Jerry Thomas.

101
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.350
I'm sorry, I'm sure
you get this a lot,

102
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.463
but you're Jerry Thomas.

103
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.715
- I am. Guilty.

104
00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:02.520
- (chuckles) Do you mind?

105
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.880
- Oh, please, sit down.
- I'm an actor.


106
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.850
- [Narrator] This guy's
a former child actor.


107
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.710
Just in case you were wondering.

108
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.287
He was famous for that hit show

109
00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:11.200
"Meet the Chadwicks" I
believe it was called.


110
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.100
Did a few after-school specials.

111
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.750
He wasn't quite one of
the Coreys, but almost.


112
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.550
- Look, I just wanted
to say I'm a huge fan.


113
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.430
I loved Meet the Chadwicks as a kid.

114
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.130
I'm sure you get that a lot, too.

115
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.110
- [Narrator] Tyler's fishing
for connections here,


116
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.990
and he's not gonna get very much.

117
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.920
A couple of nuggets of
wisdom and a pat on the back,


118
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.440
but he's hoping just one person
will give him the big break


119
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.880
that he so desperately needs.

120
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.383
- Look, I get you probably
feel stuck right now, man.


121
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.443
You wanna break out, get
out. Get your name out.


122
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.300
I mean, it's about...

123
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.840
Well, the question really is, like,

124
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.046
I mean, is it really
what you wanna be doing?


125
00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.440
Is it really you?

126
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.423
And if so, then great,
man. Chase your dreams.


127
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.930
And do what you love.

128
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.830
- But just out of curiosity,
I mean, what's it like?


129
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.673
- What's it like, being famous?

130
00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:04.730
Look, man. I'm gonna be honest with you.

131
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.530
It's just another form of captivity.

132
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.286
You're just upgrading your cage.

133
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.986
(Tyler chuckles)
No, I'm serious.


134
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.770
You're stuck now. 
You'll be stuck then.

135
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.070
But for different reasons.

136
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.590
- Hey. You all set?

137
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.950
- Yes.

138
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.870
Uh, well, look, I
actually have to head out.


139
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.583
I have a plane to catch, but um,

140
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.210
it was nice talking with
you, Tyler, and hey,


141
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.480
best of luck to you.

142
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.400
- Thanks.

143
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.233
- Take care.

144
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.261
(crickets chirp)

145
00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:44.890
(door locks)

146
00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:47.293
(Tyler sighs)

147
00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:50.383
(Tyler clears his throat)

148
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:53.800
(Tyler hums melodically)

149
00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:03.716
(Tyler clears his throat)

150
00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:13.123
(Tyler clears his throat)

151
00:07:13.123 --> 00:07:15.607
(Tyler vocalizes)

152
00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:20.607
- "You can reach out or
touch. It is a virus.


153
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.360
And it'll spread through this
city like you've never seen.


154
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.273
And yes, you can
quote me on that, sir.

155
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.613
And yes, you can
quote me on that, sir.

156
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.183
And yes, you can
quote me on that, sir.

157
00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:42.023
And yes, you can
quote me on that, sir."

158
00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:50.265
(sighs)
(sullen music)


159
00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:01.335
(microwave hums)

160
00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:11.671
(ominous tones)

161
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.980
(wind chimes ring)
(gasps and pants)


162
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.980
(pants)
(suspenseful music)


163
00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:17.496
(muffled rattling)

164
00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:26.100
Hello?

165
00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:42.637
(lock clacks)

166
00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:54.896
What the hell?

167
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:04.810
(loud thud)

168
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.893
(groans)

169
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(pants)

170
00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:26.711
(heavy knocks)
(pants)


171
00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:34.741
(thuds)

172
00:11:19.963 --> 00:11:21.907
This can't be happening.

173
00:11:44.664 --> 00:11:47.664
(suspenseful music)

174
00:11:54.778 --> 00:11:56.986
(switch clicks)

175
00:11:56.986 --> 00:11:59.653
(switch clicks)

176
00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:03.413
(switch clicks)

177
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:22.129
(door closes)

178
00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:30.816
(tense music)

179
00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:37.656
(doors and drawers thud and clunk)

180
00:12:57.636 --> 00:13:00.469
(hammering thuds)

181
00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:07.476
(wood snaps and clatters)
(hammering thuds)


182
00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:19.664
Let me out!

183
00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:21.763
Let me out of here!

184
00:13:21.763 --> 00:13:22.680
Let me out!

185
00:13:24.413 --> 00:13:27.330
(breathes sharply)

186
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.353
(yells)

187
00:13:33.353 --> 00:13:35.612
(wood clatters)

188
00:13:35.612 --> 00:13:37.340
(yells)

189
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.257
(breathes sharply)

190
00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:51.900
(ominous tones)

191
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.143
It's always the same.
(somber music)


192
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.297
Every time I go to
sleep, I'm in that place.


193
00:14:01.752 --> 00:14:03.502
I used to think it was a nightmare.

194
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.753
It's not that.

195
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.650
- [Psychiatrist] When did it start?

196
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.000
Do you remember the first time?

197
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.833
- No.

198
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.423
I keep asking myself that.

199
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.343
It's like deja vu.

200
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.360
Like the chicken and the egg.

201
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.853
I don't remember.

202
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.017
- Does it have something
to do with "The Box?"


203
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.960
- It has everything to do with that.

204
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.823
- [Psychiatrist] Tell me.

205
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.360
- [Narrator] Lewis slowly stirs.

206
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.313
Sits up.

207
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.640
He glances outside,
hopes to catch a glimpse


208
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.300
of the future through the window pane.

209
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.730
This is the language of a screenplay.

210
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.160
Does an actor become
the role he is playing,


211
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.183
or does the role become him?

212
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:10.620
(door opens)

213
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.910
- [Landlord] Hey!

214
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.780
Stevens.

215
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.980
Hey. Your rent, man.

216
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.150
- Look, I know, I know.

217
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.960
I'll have it to you by the
end of the day. I promise.


218
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.110
- You're a month overdue.

219
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.380
- It won't happen again, I swear.

220
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.650
- [Landlord] Today. Five P.M.!

221
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.483
- Yeah, I will!

222
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.180
- [Clerk] No, (scoffs)
no. This isn't gonna work.


223
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.430
- [Tyler] What's wrong?

224
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.473
- This suit is worn.

225
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.150
- What do you mean?
What're you talkin' about?


226
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.640
- There's marks on it and
some of the tags are missing.


227
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.820
- [Narrator] The suit,
you may have noticed,


228
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.060
is from the festival.

229
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.160
He took care to only wear
it for that one night


230
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.980
and he made sure to keep the
receipt, not that it helped.


231
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.310
- Please. I need the money.

232
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.020
Can't you give me something for it?

233
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.110
I paid $400 for this thing.

234
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.160
I don't even have that
kind of money, all right?


235
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.510
Look, I need-

236
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.690
- Sir!
- Look.


237
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.743
- No, it's not gonna happen,
okay? We can't return the suit.


238
00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:24.959
(trash can clunks)

239
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.023
- [Phone] You have one new voice message.

240
00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:43.220
- [Marcy] Hi, this is Marcy Whitman,

241
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.330
calling for Tyler Stevens.

242
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.210
You auditioned a few weeks
ago for the lead role


243
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.540
in a feature that I'm
casting titled "The Box."


244
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.790
I'm calling to let you
know that we'd like you


245
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.860
to come back in for a second audition.

246
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.070
Give me a call back at
your earliest convenience.


247
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.970
Thank you so much, we look...

248
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.240
(phone rings)
(Tyler clears his throat)


249
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.680
(phone rings)

250
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.670
Hello.

251
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.873
- Hi, Marcy? This is Tyler
Stevens calling you back.


252
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.320
- [Marcy] Tyler, yes!
Did you get my voicemail?


253
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.770
- Yeah, I did. I did.

254
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.830
- [Marcy] So, we're advancing
you to the next stage,


255
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.110
and we'd like to have
you in for a callback.


256
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.789
If you're still interested in the role?

257
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:23.850
- Yes, absolutely.
- Okay, great.


258
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:28.290
So, the sooner the better.
Things are moving pretty fast.


259
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.840
What's your schedule look
like for the next few days?


260
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.700
- I'm pretty flexible.
- Are you free tomorrow?


261
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.920
- Sure.
- Okay, tomorrow.


262
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.030
How does 1 P.M. sound?

263
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.863
- Perfect, yeah.

264
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.380
- [Narrator] There's no
sound in the English language


265
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.330
more appealing to an actor
than the word callback.


266
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.990
After the festival, Marcy
Whitman contacted Tyler


267
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.490
and invited him to audition.

268
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.050
Now she was asking him
back for a second round.


269
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.840
This was his chance.

270
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.458
(printer bleeps)

271
00:17:55.458 --> 00:18:00.458
(printer whirs)
(somber music)


272
00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:12.797
- "What's that you say?

273
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.730
Lewis.

274
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.993
My name's Lewis.

275
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.050
That's right.

276
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.150
I've done this before.

277
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.253
Was I as scared the
first time as I am now?


278
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.863
What's there to be scared of?

279
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.663
I'm the only one here.

280
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:38.013
I'm the only one here.

281
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.099
What's that you say?

282
00:18:45.099 --> 00:18:47.069
Lewis.
(echoing chatter)


283
00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:47.902
My name's Lewis.

284
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.720
My name is Lewis.

285
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.027
I've done this before.

286
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.949
That's right.

287
00:18:55.949 --> 00:18:58.099
Was I as scared the
first time as I am now?


288
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:02.440
What's there to be scared
of? I'm the only one here.


289
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.080
(heavy thud)

290
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.497
Maybe I'm afraid to be alone.

291
00:19:12.392 --> 00:19:15.039
(ominous tones)

292
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:20.039
(gasps and pants)
(wind chimes ring)


293
00:19:28.423 --> 00:19:30.415
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

294
00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:31.585
There's gotta be somethin'.

295
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.536
There's gotta be somewhere to...

296
00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:35.703
(mumbles)

297
00:19:38.225 --> 00:19:40.475
Something, something, um...

298
00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:43.916
A knife, a knife. Give me
a knife, give me a knife!


299
00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:46.833
(wind chimes ring)

300
00:19:58.527 --> 00:19:59.610
What is this?

301
00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:08.529
(chuckles)

302
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.623
Anything I want.

303
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.532
Give me a sledgehammer.
(wind chimes ring)


304
00:20:23.532 --> 00:20:26.532
(suspenseful music)

305
00:20:31.238 --> 00:20:34.738
(hammer clangs and thuds)

306
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.719
Give me a blowtorch!

307
00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:44.636
(blowtorch hisses)

308
00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:51.748
(ax clangs and thuds)

309
00:20:51.748 --> 00:20:54.331
(drill buzzes)

310
00:20:58.727 --> 00:21:01.644
(saw blade whines)

311
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.973
(thud)
(plaster crumbles)


312
00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:30.876
No, no, no, no!

313
00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:34.367
(brick thuds)

314
00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:37.284
(wind chimes ring)

315
00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:44.613
(breathes sharply)

316
00:21:48.329 --> 00:21:49.849
(hammer thuds)

317
00:21:49.849 --> 00:21:51.201
(whooshing)

318
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:53.590
(hammer thuds)

319
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.257
(plastic rustles and snaps)

320
00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:04.773
(hammer thuds rhythmically)

321
00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:10.315
Give me a shovel.

322
00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:30.458
(somber orchestral music)

323
00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:42.506
(wind chimes ring)

324
00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:02.240
What is this?

325
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.340
I didn't ask for this!

326
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.043
Earmuffs would be nice.

327
00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:18.409
(gun clicks)

328
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:20.742
(gun cocks)

329
00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:28.710
(gun fires)

330
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.127
(slug thuds)

331
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.313
Yeah, I thought so.

332
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.710
What is this for then, huh?

333
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.660
What is it for? '
Cause it's not for me!

334
00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:50.142
This is not for me.

335
00:23:54.007 --> 00:23:56.424
(gun clangs)

336
00:23:58.847 --> 00:24:01.514
(ominous tones)

337
00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:15.294
(sullen orchestral music)

338
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.510
- [Narrator] It is at this
point in the story that


339
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.030
the protagonist begins to
question everything he knows.


340
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.940
Tyler's beyond the words on the page.

341
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.360
He's tapped into something else now.

342
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.290
His stifling meticulous
routine of rote memorization


343
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.730
gives way to deeper instincts.

344
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.220
The spontaneous, terrifying whispers

345
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.053
that inhabit the remote
corners of his soul.


346
00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:49.990
(door opens)
(footsteps clack)


347
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.943
- Tyler Stevens?

348
00:24:57.213 --> 00:24:59.680
(door closes)

349
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.170
- [Marcy] Tyler. 
Good to see you again.

350
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.483
- Thank you. It's good
to see you too, Marcy.


351
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.280
- So, let's just
get right to the sides.

352
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.790
You're off book, right?

353
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.760
- Yes.

354
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.843
- Okay, great.

355
00:25:12.722 --> 00:25:13.730
(camera bleeps)

356
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.730
And you can begin whenever you're ready.

357
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.893
Is everything okay?

358
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.350
- I'm, I'm sorry. I'm...

359
00:25:35.663 --> 00:25:37.263
I'm just getting into character.

360
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.163
- Okay, take your time.

361
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.930
- What's that you say?

362
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.383
Lewis.

363
00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.393
My name is Lewis.

364
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.343
That's right, I've done this before.

365
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.983
Was I as scared the
first time as I am now?


366
00:26:12.374 --> 00:26:14.830
I mean, what is
there to be afraid of?

367
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.253
I'm the only one here.

368
00:26:19.413 --> 00:26:20.513
I'm the only one here.

369
00:26:24.094 --> 00:26:25.344
And maybe that's just it.

370
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.920
Maybe I'm afraid to be alone.

371
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.580
What if some people are
comfortable inside their box?


372
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.143
It's simple.

373
00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:41.064
There are walls on every side.

374
00:26:43.294 --> 00:26:44.373
It just makes sense.

375
00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.293
Fundamental logic.

376
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.923
But if you don't like your box?

377
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.970
What if it's not what you wanted?

378
00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.630
What if it is what you wanted
but you're not happy with it?


379
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.843
What do you do then?

380
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.243
You try to wake up,

381
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.353
but it doesn't let you.

382
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.293
You try to get out, but there
is no out. There is only in.


383
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.633
You go deeper in.

384
00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:22.906
In.

385
00:27:24.422 --> 00:27:25.255
In.

386
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.583
Alone.

387
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.513
But that's the thing,
I'm never really alone.


388
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.960
They're watching.

389
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.843
Always watching.

390
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.633
There.

391
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.163
Behind the glass.

392
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.070
Waiting for you to show them something

393
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.243
that they will never forget.

394
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.943
- I'm sorry, can you stop?

395
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.103
That's not in the script.

396
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:00.523
- What?

397
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.547
- [Marcy] Where did you get that from?

398
00:28:08.933 --> 00:28:11.076
Can you give us a minute?

399
00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:11.909
- Okay.

400
00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:37.170
(door opens)
(footsteps clack)


401
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.003
- Tyler?

402
00:28:41.285 --> 00:28:44.924
(footsteps clack)

403
00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:47.424
(door closes)

404
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.740
So, we just got off the
phone with the producer


405
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.303
and he would like to meet
with you, one on one.


406
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.033
- What?

407
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.660
- It doesn't mean
that you have the part.

408
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.700
You still have to do a
screen test for the director.


409
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.653
- Hold on. I thought I
just messed up the lines.


410
00:29:08.612 --> 00:29:11.390
- [Marcy] Oh, well, if that's messing up,

411
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.043
we want more of that.

412
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.347
- [Casting Assistant] Can
you do Saturday, 3 P.M.?


413
00:29:18.641 --> 00:29:21.974
(warm orchestral music)

414
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.793
- [Psychiatrist] You've
described that moment as pivotal.


415
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.460
- [Tyler] Well, it was
my first real callback.


416
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.983
- [Psychiatrist] But you
don't look back on it fondly.


417
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.420
- It's because of the crash.

418
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.250
- That's when you started
to have second thoughts?


419
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.947
How did that happen?

420
00:29:53.913 --> 00:29:56.413
(gate closes)

421
00:30:01.472 --> 00:30:04.140
(door opens)

422
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.020
- Hey! Stevens!

423
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.061
Where the hell's the rent, huh?

424
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:10.130
- (sighs) Look, I'm gonna
have it for you soon!


425
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.710
- Are you joking?

426
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.190
Do you want me to pull
out your rental agreement?


427
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.660
You promised to pay on time,
in full, at the beginning


428
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.390
of each month!
- I fell behind.


429
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.390
It won't happen again. I promise.

430
00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.730
- [Landlord] No more promises!

431
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.030
If you don't get
me that money by Friday,

432
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.753
I'm calling the police and
your ass is out on the street!


433
00:30:29.162 --> 00:30:31.482
(door slams)
(somber music)


434
00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:33.512
(keys clink)

435
00:30:33.512 --> 00:30:36.012
(Tyler sighs)

436
00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:40.144
(trash can thuds)
(Tyler grunts)


437
00:30:40.144 --> 00:30:41.333
(Tyler yells)

438
00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:43.833
(heavy thuds)

439
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.073
- I gave myself 48 hours.

440
00:30:53.869 --> 00:30:57.450
I calculated if I worked two
all-nighters, back to back,


441
00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.283
I'd have rent.

442
00:31:01.942 --> 00:31:04.310
(car starts)

443
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.533
48 hours.

444
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.190
I didn't even make it 12.

445
00:31:09.462 --> 00:31:12.045
(somber music)

446
00:31:34.224 --> 00:31:37.557
(muffled tires screech)

447
00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:46.125
(muffled tires screech)

448
00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:52.701
(wind chimes rings)
(grunts)


449
00:32:01.013 --> 00:32:03.096
(grunts)

450
00:32:26.443 --> 00:32:28.943
(bleak music)

451
00:32:50.692 --> 00:32:53.275
(drawer thuds)

452
00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:26.528
(door opens)

453
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.810
(gun clunks)

454
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.050
(door closes)

455
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.550
(lock clicks)

456
00:33:38.748 --> 00:33:41.581
(breathes deeply)

457
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.553
(coughs)

458
00:34:07.249 --> 00:34:08.297
Help.

459
00:34:08.297 --> 00:34:09.130
Help.

460
00:34:10.769 --> 00:34:12.852
(coughs)

461
00:34:14.401 --> 00:34:16.610
(distant sirens wail)

462
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.841
(coughs)

463
00:34:18.841 --> 00:34:20.924
(groans)

464
00:34:23.612 --> 00:34:25.695
(groans)

465
00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.031
(car door opens)

466
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:31.531
(body clunks)

467
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.503
- [Nurse] Tyler?

468
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.403
Tyler?

469
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.093
Tyler?

470
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.860
Hi, my name is Victoria.

471
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.380
I'm gonna be looking
after you today, okay?


472
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.370
Let's see. Are you feeling
any pain right now?


473
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.560
- Yes.

474
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.720
- [Victoria] All right. Is
there anything that you need?


475
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.480
Do you need to use the restroom?

476
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.060
- What happened to my car?

477
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.980
- [Victoria] I'm gonna
need you to not worry


478
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.040
about your car right now, okay?

479
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.390
I'm gonna need you to lie
there. Stay calm, okay?


480
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.713
Do you have any emergency contacts?

481
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.303
Anyone in the area we can call?

482
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:17.740
(Tyler sobs)
(somber music)


483
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.100
Okay, um, I'm gonna get the doctor, okay?

484
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.563
Just hold tight.

485
00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:25.206
(Tyler sobs)

486
00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:47.770
(crickets chirp)

487
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.090
- [Narrator] What happens
when you can't see


488
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:49.963
the road anymore?

489
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.993
When the doubt sets in.

490
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.593
Tyler's bruises cover more
than just his skin and his ego.


491
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.703
When did that innocent
childhood dream escape him?


492
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.850
The passion that led him all those years

493
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.583
before the ruthless pragmatism
of adulthood set in?


494
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.200
His career has become a dirty word.

495
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.550
It should live on his corkboard,

496
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.050
next to all the other motivational
quotes he's collected.


497
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.510
Now that Tyler is just another orphan

498
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.427
in a city of broken dreams.

499
00:36:31.436 --> 00:36:34.186
(knocks on door)

500
00:36:35.948 --> 00:36:37.247
(knocks on door)

501
00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:39.830
(Tyler groans)

502
00:36:41.609 --> 00:36:43.560
(knocks on door)

503
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.213
- I swear to god, Tyler,
I know you're in there!


504
00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:49.443
You open this door right now!

505
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.973
I know you can hear me!

506
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.960
Listen to me, asshole!

507
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.950
I've already filled out
the eviction paperwork!


508
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.386
You're done!

509
00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:00.303
You're out!

510
00:37:01.637 --> 00:37:04.963
So we can either do this the
easy way, or the hard way.


511
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.373
- I was in an accident.

512
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.240
- I don't give a shit.

513
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.170
You got 12 hours.

514
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:18.620
And then I'm calling the cops.

515
00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:26.359
(somber orchestral music)

516
00:37:33.821 --> 00:37:36.654
(mattress hisses)

517
00:38:28.574 --> 00:38:31.074
(lock bleeps)

518
00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:37.544
(suitcase unzips)

519
00:38:46.981 --> 00:38:49.481
(Tyler sighs)

520
00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.700
(phone rings)

521
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.500
(suspenseful piano music)

522
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.000
(phone rings)

523
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.120
(phone vibrates)

524
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.400
(phone vibrates)

525
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.143
- Hello?

526
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.333
Tyler?

527
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.060
- Hi.

528
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.893
Sarah.

529
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.773
- [Sarah] Hi.

530
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.660
- I just, uh...

531
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.143
- [Sarah] Hello?

532
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.883
- Hi.

533
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.130
I was just, um...

534
00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:53.007
I was just callin' to
see how you were doin'.


535
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.919
- [Sarah] I'm doing all right.

536
00:39:56.919 --> 00:39:58.500
(somber piano music)

537
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.667
- That's good.

538
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.420
- [Sarah] What about you?

539
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.879
- Me? (chuckles)

540
00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:09.020
You know me, I'm...

541
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.103
I'm just taking it
one day at a time.

542
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.540
- [Sarah] Yeah, I uh,

543
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.340
keep waiting to see you
on a billboard somewhere.


544
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.717
- Yeah.

545
00:40:18.717 --> 00:40:20.634
(sobs)

546
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.873
- So what's up?

547
00:40:27.159 --> 00:40:29.510
(Tyler sniffles)

548
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.343
Tyler?

549
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:35.803
- Hey, I'm sorry.

550
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.337
- [Sarah] Are you okay?

551
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.030
- Yeah, I just...

552
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.480
Hearing your voice...

553
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.677
You don't even know.

554
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.383
I am out here, all alone,

555
00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:57.919
and no one gives a shit.

556
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.473
I totaled my car and I'm broke,

557
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.090
and I could've died yesterday,

558
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.890
and no one in this city
would've cared, it's...


559
00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.823
It's pathetic.

560
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.690
I'm sorry, I...

561
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.560
I'm such a jerk, 
I shouldn't have called,

562
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.260
and I shouldn't be laying
all of this on you.


563
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.450
I'm sorry, I just don't have anyone-

564
00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.410
- No. No, it's okay.

565
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.283
I'm glad you called.

566
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.483
- I miss you like crazy out here.

567
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.523
Really.

568
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:48.603
- [Sarah] Me too.

569
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.913
- Why did we break up?

570
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.330
- Because I was holding you back.

571
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.796
- (chuckles) No, don't
feed me my bullshit lines.


572
00:42:04.796 --> 00:42:07.420
- You have a gift. It's true.

573
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.470
- You wanna know something about my gift?

574
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.483
Everyone out here has one.

575
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.460
You ask the mailman and he's
got head shots in his trunk,


576
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.480
or a script or some

577
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.813
award-winning short film
that no one has ever seen.


578
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.503
If you ask them, they will show you.

579
00:42:29.471 --> 00:42:30.304
- Look.

580
00:42:32.092 --> 00:42:34.290
I don't know anything about Hollywood,

581
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.163
or how the movie business works, but,

582
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.210
if you feel like you've
exhausted every option


583
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.570
and you're done, then...

584
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.880
There's nothing wrong with that, you know?

585
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.722
I'm gonna send you some money.

586
00:42:56.722 --> 00:42:59.180
- No. No, Sarah, you
don't have to do that.


587
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.990
- No, no, you have to
have a car out there,


588
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.740
or you're gonna get stranded, so...

589
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.023
Is, uh, $1,000 okay?

590
00:43:09.121 --> 00:43:10.270
(Tyler sniffles)

591
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:11.103
- Yeah.

592
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.593
Thank you.

593
00:43:15.729 --> 00:43:16.562
- Okay.

594
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.060
I need you to know that I...

595
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.763
I want you to be happy.

596
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.276
I didn't want you to resent me, that's,

597
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.929
that's why I never
tried to win you back.

598
00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:35.419
- I know, I know.

599
00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:36.252
I know.

600
00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:41.509
- [Sarah] Okay.

601
00:43:42.777 --> 00:43:45.777
Well, I gotta go get some sleep now.

602
00:43:46.665 --> 00:43:47.498
- Okay.

603
00:43:50.464 --> 00:43:52.956
(Tyler sniffles)

604
00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:54.039
- I love you.

605
00:44:04.043 --> 00:44:04.876
- Bye.

606
00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:10.579
- Bye.

607
00:44:18.018 --> 00:44:20.435
(Tyler sobs)

608
00:44:32.238 --> 00:44:35.238
(phone alarm rings)

609
00:44:36.618 --> 00:44:39.618
(phone alarm rings)

610
00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:43.432
(phone alarm rings)

611
00:44:43.432 --> 00:44:46.102
(groans)

612
00:44:46.102 --> 00:44:49.102
(phone alarm rings)

613
00:44:51.011 --> 00:44:54.011
(phone alarm rings)

614
00:45:07.202 --> 00:45:09.619
(car starts)

615
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.790
Hi, this is Tyler Stevens
calling for Marcy Whitman.


616
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.103
- [Woman On Phone] One moment, please.

617
00:45:28.149 --> 00:45:30.050
- [Marcy] Hello?

618
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.920
- Hi, Marcy.

619
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.413
This is Tyler Stevens.

620
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.383
- [Marcy] Tyler, hey! 
How's it goin'?

621
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.890
- It's, uh, it's going all right.

622
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.383
I was just calling to
see if I could, um,

623
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.133
postpone or cancel the meeting today?

624
00:45:50.751 --> 00:45:51.834
- [Marcy] Oh?

625
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.713
What's wrong?

626
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.281
- I got into a
car accident the other day.

627
00:45:58.281 --> 00:46:00.670
- [Marcy] I'm sorry to hear
that. Are you all right?


628
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.813
- I'm okay, I just don't
really look myself.


629
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.697
And, um, and I just...
I don't want to, uh-


630
00:46:08.697 --> 00:46:10.870
- [Marcy] See, the thing
is, if you're okay,


631
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.443
I would really encourage
you not to cancel.


632
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.340
Do what you have to do,

633
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.943
but this is a meeting
that you don't wanna miss.


634
00:46:31.277 --> 00:46:33.777
(Tyler sighs)

635
00:46:54.008 --> 00:46:56.758
(intercom rings)

636
00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.300
(intercom rings)

637
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.810
- [Producer] Yep?

638
00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:05.663
- Hi, this is Tyler Stevens, the actor.

639
00:47:07.016 --> 00:47:08.173
- Oh. Oh, yes!

640
00:47:09.128 --> 00:47:10.268
Come up.

641
00:47:10.268 --> 00:47:13.048
(intercom bleeps)

642
00:47:13.048 --> 00:47:16.355
(car window hums)

643
00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:18.855
(Tyler sighs)

644
00:47:34.436 --> 00:47:37.269
(car door creaks)

645
00:47:40.088 --> 00:47:42.921
(car door closes)

646
00:47:49.547 --> 00:47:51.400
Mr. Stevens.

647
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.090
- Hey.
- Hey, come in.


648
00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:53.923
Follow me.

649
00:47:55.735 --> 00:47:56.840
(door creaks)

650
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.673
Come in.

651
00:47:58.655 --> 00:48:00.287
(door creaks)

652
00:48:00.287 --> 00:48:02.040
(door slams)

653
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.140
We'll be through here.

654
00:48:05.786 --> 00:48:07.270
- You have a beautiful house.

655
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.333
- Yeah, yeah. It's all my wife's taste.

656
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.360
Oh, I heard you got into a
little bit of an accident.


657
00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.820
Is everything okay?

658
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.630
- Yeah, um, just a little bit-

659
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:18.983
- These are all originals.

660
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.253
Out here.

661
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:26.260
(sighs)

662
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.750
Philippe.

663
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.583
Hello.

664
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.060
We're gonna be in the pool house.

665
00:48:38.296 --> 00:48:39.129
After you.

666
00:48:40.776 --> 00:48:41.926
- Thank you.
- Cheers.


667
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.083
Well, (clears throat) take a seat.

668
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.460
Right, I don't believe
in wasting time, so,


669
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.060
let's get right to the
point about why you're here.


670
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.900
The director saw your audition tapes,

671
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.250
and he loves what you did.

672
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:02.720
I do, too.

673
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.223
We are very close to being
able to make you an offer.


674
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.730
That is, we'd like you
to be in the film.

675
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.000
Now, um, one of the things
the director's asked me to do


676
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.150
is to, uh, give you a
copy of the screenplay.


677
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.590
Take a look at it, you know,
when you've got a chance.


678
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.000
Make some notes.

679
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.180
I'm sure you've gathered by
now what the film's about,


680
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.550
in the abstract, but
basically the concept is


681
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.260
there's a guy stuck in a house
and he's trying to get out,


682
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.660
but every time he does so,

683
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.540
he keeps coming up against
these walls of mirrors.


684
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.890
You'll be playing the lead.

685
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.830
His name's Lewis. Actually,
that might change, but anyway...


686
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:47.190
It's a very symbolic story.
You'll see what I mean.


687
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:51.920
We've been, we've been pitching
it as "Castaway in a house."


688
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.683
You know the Tom Hanks movie?

689
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.890
- Yeah.
- So, um, you know.


690
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.673
Let us know what you think.

691
00:50:04.299 --> 00:50:07.799
(somber orchestral music)

692
00:50:23.096 --> 00:50:25.846
(phone vibrates)

693
00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:29.625
(phone vibrates)

694
00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:33.502
(phone vibrates)

695
00:51:07.346 --> 00:51:10.058
(rumbling)

696
00:51:10.058 --> 00:51:12.787
(wind chimes ring)

697
00:51:12.787 --> 00:51:17.787
(Tyler gasps and pants)
(eerie music)


698
00:51:23.696 --> 00:51:25.946
(creaking)

699
00:51:39.398 --> 00:51:41.648
(creaking)

700
00:51:45.312 --> 00:51:47.562
(creaking)

701
00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:53.670
(screeching)

702
00:51:57.583 --> 00:52:02.083
(creaking)
(scraping)


703
00:52:09.017 --> 00:52:13.684
(screeching)
(creaking)


704
00:52:19.014 --> 00:52:24.014
(object clunks)
(upbeat swing music)


705
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.799
- Hey!

706
00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:37.539
Who are you?

707
00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:38.706
- Who are you?

708
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.020
- [Neighbor] I asked first.

709
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.570
- How did you do that?

710
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.560
I've been trying to get
out of here for so long.


711
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.600
- I don't know.

712
00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.660
A square just appeared on the
wall and I started pushing it


713
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.470
and, uh, you were
pulling it too, it seems.


714
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.299
I mean, that's it, really.

715
00:53:04.299 --> 00:53:06.180
- Are you sure you
didn't do anything else?


716
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.720
- I'm sure it will never happen again.

717
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.320
- What's going on in your place?

718
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:12.023
Let me see.

719
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:22.910
Who are they?

720
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.050
- Just characters. (chuckles)

721
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.420
- They're not real?

722
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.280
- What's so great about real?

723
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.343
It's all in good fun.

724
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.550
What's your name?

725
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:40.730
It's okay. I don't know, either.

726
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.340
I can't remember a damn thing down here.

727
00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.050
It's like we're in the fifth
dimension or something,


728
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:47.280
which would make sense because
here we are in these cubes


729
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.130
that we can't get out of,

730
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:53.400
perhaps due to our dimensional
limitations and, uh...


731
00:53:54.347 --> 00:53:55.180
Hm.

732
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.630
It is strange, though, isn't it?

733
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.180
- You don't have
any mirrors on your side.

734
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.713
- Mirrors?

735
00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.730
What do you mean?

736
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.563
- Nevermind.

737
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.850
- There's a story in your eyes.

738
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.700
Would you mind if I made
a character from you?


739
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.900
- How would you do that?

740
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.290
- Tell me about yourself.

741
00:54:23.198 --> 00:54:25.460
- I don't know anything.
- Sure you do!


742
00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.653
Superficial things like your
name, that gets forgotten.


743
00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.720
But your passions, your fears.

744
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.553
That's visceral.

745
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:35.573
It's all in there.

746
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:37.503
Look around.

747
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.500
What's your favorite room in the house?

748
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.560
- I don't know.

749
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.710
- What is the place
you feel the most safe?


750
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.653
- My bedroom.

751
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.190
- What's in the bedroom?

752
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:57.790
- There isn't anything in there.

753
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:02.170
- Close your eyes.
(suspenseful music)


754
00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:03.170
You're in there now.

755
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:06.103
Let your feelings become visual.

756
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.623
Let the room populate.

757
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.090
What do you see?

758
00:55:29.996 --> 00:55:32.700
(upbeat swing music)

759
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.450
Now what is your least
favorite room in the house?


760
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.300
The place where you never want to go.

761
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.183
Yes.

762
00:55:43.567 --> 00:55:46.234
(ominous music)

763
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:49.943
Why do you fear it?

764
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.830
- I'm afraid I'll be trapped in there.

765
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.573
Alone.

766
00:55:58.356 --> 00:56:03.356
(switch clicks)
(pants)


767
00:56:03.506 --> 00:56:06.550
(door slams)

768
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.550
- You fear the dark?

769
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.670
- I fear the emptiness.

770
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.050
- Yes.

771
00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:15.550
That's right.

772
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:16.700
Your passion runs deep.

773
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.720
It's palpable.

774
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.243
- What does it mean?
(wind chimes ring)


775
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.280
- That must be the singularity!

776
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.470
- What?
- It's the refresh.


777
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:28.990
I hope to meet you again someday,

778
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.200
though certainly not down here.

779
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.220
- No, no. No, no, no, wait!

780
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.343
Wait, stop!
- Bye!


781
00:57:10.914 --> 00:57:14.747
(melancholy orchestral music)

782
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:28.480
- [Father] Okay, 
I'm recording.

783
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.643
So, where are we right now?

784
00:57:31.643 --> 00:57:33.100
- Burger place.

785
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.190
- [Father] And where were we just now?

786
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:36.774
- School.

787
00:57:36.774 --> 00:57:39.550
- [Father] (chuckles) And
what were we doing at school?


788
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.053
What were you doing at school, Tyler?

789
00:57:42.053 --> 00:57:43.920
- [Tyler] I was in a play.

790
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.940
- [Father] You were in a play?

791
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.203
What kind of play? What
was the name of the play?


792
00:57:49.112 --> 00:57:50.577
- "Peter Pan."

793
00:57:50.577 --> 00:57:53.060
- [Father] Yeah, "Peter
Pan." That's right.


794
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.931
And what were you doing in it?

795
00:57:54.931 --> 00:57:55.764
- Acting.

796
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.130
- [Father] Well, 
I should hope so.

797
00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:00.413
And what was the name of your part?

798
00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:03.610
- [Tyler] Peter Pan.

799
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.120
- [Father] You were Peter Pan?

800
00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.290
Isn't that like the
biggest role in the play?


801
00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:08.370
- Mm-hm.

802
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:11.270
- [Father] So, you were
the star of the show?


803
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:12.180
- [Tyler] Yeah.

804
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.680
- [Father] That is so cool.
Are you proud of yourself?


805
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.157
Well, you should be. Mom and
I are really proud of you.


806
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.130
All right, so what comes
next? Another play?


807
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:25.530
- I...

808
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:28.690
In a play? I'm gonna go to Hollywood.

809
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:30.271
- [Father] You're gonna go where?

810
00:58:30.271 --> 00:58:31.440
- Hollywood!

811
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.781
- [Father] Hollywood?
What're you gonna do there?


812
00:58:34.781 --> 00:58:36.710
- [Tyler] I'm gonna be a movie star.

813
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.250
- [Father] Oh! (chuckles)

814
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:42.450
Movie star? What kind of
movies are you gonna be in?


815
00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.200
- [Tyler] Big movies.

816
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.393
- [Father] Big movies!

817
00:58:45.393 --> 00:58:47.977
All right. I wanna see some big movies.

818
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.040
All right, Tyler. I
think our food's coming.


819
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.540
Say goodbye to the camera now.

820
00:58:55.402 --> 00:58:56.235
- Bye.

821
00:59:08.633 --> 00:59:11.383
(Tyler sniffles)

822
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.183
Hi, this is Tyler Stevens calling.

823
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.130
I just wanted to let you
know that I really appreciate


824
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:21.000
you meeting with me yesterday, but...

825
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:25.383
Look, I read the script, I
thought it was brilliant.


826
00:59:27.014 --> 00:59:28.864
(chuckles) It's really great, I just,

827
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.443
I have to decline the role.

828
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.500
I'm really sorry that
I can't be in the film.


829
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.433
But thank you again and good
luck with your production.


830
00:59:44.933 --> 00:59:46.432
(ominous music)

831
00:59:46.432 --> 00:59:51.349
(trunk door slams)
(sighs)


832
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.210
(phone vibrates)

833
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:08.440
(phone vibrates)

834
01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:12.682
(phone vibrates)

835
01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:25.996
(wind chimes ring)

836
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:29.883
(breathes deeply)

837
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.770
Kerosine.

838
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:40.943
Five gallons.

839
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.010
And matches.

840
01:00:44.078 --> 01:00:46.995
(wind chimes ring)

841
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.700
(suspenseful music)

842
01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.054
(car door closes)

843
01:01:24.054 --> 01:01:26.971
(truck horn honks)

844
01:01:54.198 --> 01:01:58.212
(dark orchestral music)

845
01:01:58.212 --> 01:02:00.962
(phone vibrates)

846
01:02:02.304 --> 01:02:05.054
(phone vibrates)

847
01:02:06.506 --> 01:02:09.256
(phone vibrates)

848
01:02:16.285 --> 01:02:17.916
Hello?

849
01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:21.666
- [Man On Phone] Tyler.
Do you know who I am?


850
01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:25.220
- You're the director.
- Yes.


851
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.680
It's like we've met somewhere before,

852
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.043
but I can't put my
finger on where or when.


853
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.353
I know you feel it, too.

854
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.720
You know, I've been writing
"The Box" for six years now.


855
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.420
The idea came to me in a dream,

856
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.920
but it's taken six years
for me to fully grasp it.


857
01:02:42.754 --> 01:02:44.660
What it really means, and even then,

858
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.550
in many ways it's still
a mediocre piece of work.


859
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.950
I mean, I'll be the first to admit.

860
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.983
The dialogue is either too
convoluted, too contrived.


861
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.510
The action, the emotions,

862
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:57.390
some of it is incongruous, in my opinion.

863
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.103
I mean, it's workable, but not ideal.

864
01:03:01.474 --> 01:03:02.470
(door slams)

865
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.080
I wasn't sure if it was
ready for the screen,


866
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.380
but I felt compelled to
make it this year, so,


867
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.103
I started my search.

868
01:03:11.535 --> 01:03:12.368
(match strikes)

869
01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:13.273
For the one actor.

870
01:03:14.834 --> 01:03:17.330
(flames roar)

871
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:18.730
And when I found you, Tyler,

872
01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.080
I have to be honest, you
took the pedestrian words


873
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.850
I had written on the page and
you made them something real,


874
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:25.983
something meaningful.

875
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.630
I know you're considering
not doing the film now,


876
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.550
but I would implore you
to think about that,


877
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:36.350
because I cannot, I will not
do this film without you.


878
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.883
- This isn't about the film.

879
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:43.843
If anything the film made me
realize that I have to go home.


880
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.993
Lewis ends up alone, doesn't he?

881
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.160
- [Director] It depends
on how you interpret


882
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.143
the final scene.

883
01:03:54.043 --> 01:03:56.543
(door closes)

884
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.120
I'm a little surprised by you, Tyler.

885
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.960
I thought you were the
type who would do anything


886
01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.740
in the world to make
your dreams come true.


887
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.120
You know the stakes.

888
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.990
You know what this role
would mean for your career.


889
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:16.510
- Yeah, what's at stake?

890
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:18.380
- [Director] What's at stake?

891
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.900
Greatness.

892
01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.763
Make no mistake about it,
but you already knew that.


893
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.580
Why'd you become an actor, Tyler?

894
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.343
Really.

895
01:04:31.252 --> 01:04:32.602
- There was never a choice.

896
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.080
- [Director] You had to do it.

897
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.980
Like an impulse that
was beyond your control.


898
01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.020
That's how we all are, Tyler.

899
01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.170
If you walk away right
now, you deny your purpose,


900
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:46.120
your identity, and it will eat you alive.

901
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.860
An entire life invested in
the pursuit of one thing.


902
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.063
Who are you without it?

903
01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:54.863
Who are you?

904
01:05:19.098 --> 01:05:21.515
(door opens)

905
01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.756
(door opens)

906
01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.662
(door opens)

907
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.120
- After all that,

908
01:06:13.727 --> 01:06:14.910
I can't help but feel

909
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:17.403
confused,

910
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:20.243
and lost.

911
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.243
Just as lost as I ever was.

912
01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.903
It doesn't make any sense.

913
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760
I got what I wanted.

914
01:06:37.538 --> 01:06:39.121
Why am I not happy?

915
01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:00.493
What's that you say?

916
01:07:03.183 --> 01:07:04.016
Lewis.

917
01:07:05.691 --> 01:07:07.108
My name is Lewis.

918
01:07:09.543 --> 01:07:11.797
That's right, I've done this before.

919
01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:17.980
Was I as scared the
first time as I am now?


920
01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.350
I mean, what is
there to be afraid of?

921
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:23.750
I'm the only one here.

922
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:28.814
I'm the only one here.

923
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.663
Maybe that's just it.

924
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:35.460
Maybe I'm afraid to be alone.

925
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.110
What if some people are
comfortable inside their box?


926
01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:45.563
It's simple.

927
01:07:47.113 --> 01:07:50.932
There are walls on every side.
(cameras snap)


928
01:07:50.932 --> 01:07:51.932
It just makes sense.

929
01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.261
Fundamental logic.
(cameras snap)


930
01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:58.910
(brooding electronic music)
(cameras snap)


931
01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:00.710
But what if you don't like your box?

932
01:08:01.973 --> 01:08:05.161
And if it's not what you wanted.

933
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:06.501
But what if it is what you wanted,

934
01:08:06.501 --> 01:08:08.170
but you're not happy with it?

935
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.813
What do you do then?

936
01:08:09.813 --> 01:08:12.760
(cameras snap)

937
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.710
You try to wake up.

938
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.873
But it doesn't let you.

939
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:19.180
You try to get out.

940
01:08:20.613 --> 01:08:22.723
But there is no
out, there is only in.

941
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.043
You go deeper in.

942
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:30.494
In.

943
01:08:31.912 --> 01:08:32.745
In.

944
01:08:35.452 --> 01:08:36.285
Alone.

945
01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:42.782
But that's the thing,
I'm never really alone.


946
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:44.500
They're watching.

947
01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:47.363
Always watching.

948
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.173
There.

949
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:52.663
Behind the glass.

950
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:55.210
Waiting for you to show them something

951
01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:57.607
that they will never forget.

952
01:09:00.272 --> 01:09:02.855
(somber music)
