1
00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:13.993
Hey, man, I'm Kevin Smith.

2
00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:17.077
And moments after we shot
the show you're about to watch,


3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
I came into this room downstairs
at the theater in Glendale,


4
00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:24.160
and had a massive heart attack.

5
00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:25.826
They talk about, like,
"I killed onstage.


6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.868
I died onstage."
I thought I killed that night,


7
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:31.369
and I came backstage
and almost died.


8
00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.743
So enjoy the special,
but know that the guy


9
00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:38.701
who is telling jokes
for the next hour and stuff


10
00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:41.285
is about to face the infinite.

11
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:46.285
And I'm alive to stand here
and tell you that I didn't die.


12
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.077
Now, on with the show.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.619
Ladies
and gentlemen,


14
00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:52.494
Kevin Smith!

15
00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.118
Hey!

16
00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:19.868
Thank you!

17
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:23.993
Stop. Don't. Stop, fucking
don't encourage me.


18
00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:26.951
Um... thank you all
for being here tonight.


19
00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:29.660
I had stuff that I wanted
to-- prepared and what not.


20
00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:32.285
But before we go anywhere,
I have to share some shit


21
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.910
that just literally happened
before I got here.


22
00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:37.327
If you don't know me,
you're like,


23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.577
"Oh, he's ready to do a show."

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.868
If you know me, you're like,

25
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.285
"Fuck, he's more high than I've
ever seen him in his life."


26
00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:46.452
Right when I was getting ready
to leave,


27
00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.910
my daughter comes in,
and she just got her license.


28
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:50.993
So she comes into the room
and she's just like,


29
00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.660
"Hey, man, can I use your car?"

30
00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:54.785
She says to my wife Jennifer,
"Let me use your car


31
00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:57.910
to go to Target
and get my nails done."


32
00:01:57.993 --> 00:01:59.993
And Jennifer was like,
"Absolutely not.


33
00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:03.660
Oh, my God, no.
Like, you'll crash for sure."


34
00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:06.118
And I saw my moment to jump in
and be the good parent


35
00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:08.826
and be like, "Let her do it."
You know?


36
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.035
Like, she's gotta try it
by herself for the first time.


37
00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:11.868
This is the first time
she's gonna drive by herself


38
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:14.535
in the car with a license
and stuff.


39
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:15.410
I was like, "Let her do it, man.

40
00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:17.285
What's the worst
that could happen?"


41
00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.951
And my wife was shooting
fucking daggers at me.


42
00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:20.951
Just like, "You fucking
piece of shit."


43
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.369
So... so I was like,
"Yeah, man, let's just let...


44
00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:26.035
She can do this.
You can handle this, kid."


45
00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.035
I said, "Just don't speed
or anything like that.


46
00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:30.701
Trust that she's a good driver.
You've been in the car with her.


47
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:34.077
She's not fucking terrible."
And so...


48
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.243
Trust that she can do this
and stuff.


49
00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:39.452
So, you know, I was like,
"All right, man. Have fun."


50
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.785
And I stood at the front door
and watched her pull away


51
00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:44.035
and stuff,
which was nerve-racking


52
00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:46.285
because she had to do a K-turn
and she backed out


53
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.660
without even looking and another
car was coming down the hill.


54
00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:50.202
And they had one
of these moments.


55
00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:51.660
And you heard skidding
and I didn't know


56
00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:53.035
which one it was and shit.

57
00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:55.327
Finally, she corrects herself
and then there's a moment


58
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.785
where the dude behind her
clearly wants to go faster.


59
00:02:57.868 --> 00:03:00.160
And my kid, the novice driver,
I'm watching this go,


60
00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:01.993
"Let him go first.
Let him go first."


61
00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:05.785
But she's my kid,
very competitive as well.


62
00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:08.035
And I saw my driving in her.
All of a sudden,


63
00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:11.410
she guns it past this fucking
dude down the street.


64
00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:12.410
And my wife is like, "Yeah,

65
00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:16.410
she's ready to drive
by herself."


66
00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.118
So I was like this
is fucking nerve-racking, man.


67
00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:20.535
And she was like, "You shouldn't
have let her do this."


68
00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.160
I was like, "I need a joint."
And so I started smoking.


69
00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.743
And I was like, "What do we do?
Do we chase her down?"


70
00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:26.910
She's like, "No, that doesn't
show any trust whatsoever."


71
00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:30.619
She's going, "I have
Find Friends on my phone.


72
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.743
And so I can track
her every movement."


73
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.660
And so I was like,
"Are you fucking serious?


74
00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:37.619
Open that shit up, man!

75
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:42.410
Let's watch this car wreck
in real time." Like...


76
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:43.785
So we were just
sitting at the desk


77
00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:46.118
and I'm fucking smoking away,
watching the screen


78
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:47.452
on my wife's phone,
watching this dot,


79
00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:50.826
like I'm fucking Bill Paxton
in Aliens  and shit. You know.


80
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.327
I'm like,
"She's all over us, man!"


81
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.785
'Cause every time the dot
stops on the map,


82
00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:59.619
we're like, "What's the
fucking story here?


83
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:02.160
Did she get in a fender bender?
Is she buying cocaine?


84
00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:04.535
What is going on?"

85
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.577
Then finally, it pulled into
the fucking Target plaza.


86
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.369
And I was like, "You gotta
fucking text her."


87
00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:11.285
And she's like, "No, she'll know
we've been watching her.


88
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:12.452
You gotta fucking play it cool."

89
00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:14.035
And we're both sweating
fucking bullets, man.


90
00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:16.494
And I've smoked a joint
all the way down


91
00:04:16.577 --> 00:04:17.868
to the fucking filter
and shit.


92
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:18.993
All of a sudden, the kid
calls us on the phone.


93
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:22.410
And she's like, "I did it!
I did it! I did it!"


94
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.452
She's like, "I did it.
I didn't get in an accident."


95
00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:25.826
And we tried to play it cool.
We're like,


96
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.951
"Well, big deal.
We do that all the time."


97
00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:37.410
Um, it's weird, man because
the kid's all grown up now.


98
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:40.993
She, like, graduated last year
from high school and shit.


99
00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:44.243
And that was like the moment
my wife had been waiting for,


100
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:46.494
for, like, four years.
'Cause my wife used to travel


101
00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.410
with me wherever I went.
If I went to make a movie,


102
00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:50.035
we'd go, leave the house,
and go someplace


103
00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:52.327
for a couple months
or something like that.


104
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.369
We'd pull the kid out of school
'cause she was little.


105
00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:55.077
It's like, what is she
gonna fucking learn?


106
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.410
ABC's? Come with us.
We'll show you the real world.


107
00:04:57.494 --> 00:04:58.868
You know.

108
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.035
You know, I was like, I started
traveling by myself.


109
00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:02.202
I started doing more and more
like standup gigs


110
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:05.619
and live podcasts, and so I used
to travel with Jen,


111
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:07.951
and now I just wound up
traveling by myself.


112
00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:10.535
Because she stayed home
for the kid.


113
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:12.243
Like, I was like, "Why aren't
you going anymore?"


114
00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:14.202
She's like, "The kid's
in fucking high school."


115
00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.701
Somebody has to stay home to let
her in the fucking house, man."


116
00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:18.285
So... I was like, fair enough.

117
00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.619
So I got used to going out
on the road without her.


118
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.035
And then the kid graduated and
my wife was like going crazy.


119
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:26.118
She was like, "Oh, my God.
My fucking...


120
00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:27.077
I'm finally getting sprung

121
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.035
from this goddamn
gilded prison and shit."


122
00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:31.285
I was like,
"What are you talking about?"


123
00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:32.868
She's like, "This kid
is fucking done.


124
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.035
I don't have to be
the bitch mother anymore.


125
00:05:34.118 --> 00:05:36.910
Like, I'm tired of playing
this role.


126
00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:38.202
I don't wanna wake her up
and fucking make her do shit,


127
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.868
do your homework.
Now she's fucking done.


128
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:43.369
I'm gonna be done,
and I'm getting my life back,


129
00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:44.327
motherfucker." She goes,

130
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.243
"Which means I'm taking
over your life.


131
00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.077
What are you..."

132
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.910
She's like, "You're always
fucking going somewhere.


133
00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:52.868
I'm going with you wherever
you're fucking going next.


134
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.369
Man, you're always going
to some fucking rocking place.


135
00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:57.410
What rocking city are you
traveling to next?"


136
00:05:57.494 --> 00:06:00.660
And I was like,
"Spokane, Washington."


137
00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:03.743
And she was just like,
"You know what, man?


138
00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:05.202
I heard about that shit
on Frasier.


139
00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:08.077
I'm fucking going with you."

140
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.077
So she came with me
to Spokane, Washington.


141
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.619
I had two gigs. I was doing
a gig at 7:30


142
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:15.118
and then another gig
at like 9:30


143
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:15.910
or something like that.

144
00:06:15.993 --> 00:06:16.993
So we got to the hotel,

145
00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:20.077
and I'm not a, like,
hotel snob at all.


146
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.826
All I care about when it comes
to a hotel room,


147
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.035
'cause I see a lot of fucking
hotel rooms now,


148
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:25.410
is the balcony.
'Cause that's--


149
00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:28.160
As a stoner, that's where I live
is on the balcony.


150
00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:30.202
So the room could be
like a fucking crack den


151
00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:32.285
with roaches everywhere
and shit.


152
00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.951
I will tiptoe over human piles
of shit,


153
00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:38.660
as long as the balcony is wide
enough and secluded enough,


154
00:06:38.743 --> 00:06:39.619
I'm like, I don't give a shit.

155
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:41.494
I'll sleep on the
fucking balcony. So...


156
00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:44.452
We checked in the hotel,
great fucking balcony.


157
00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:45.619
Like it was looking over
a stream


158
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:48.243
and fucking foliage and shit.
It was really pretty.


159
00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:49.285
You can see the mountains.

160
00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:51.535
So I was like, "I love
this fucking balcony."


161
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.785
And she's like, "When are you
coming back?"


162
00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:54.327
"I got two shows, so I'll
probably be back


163
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.951
at like 11, 12." She's like,
"I might be sleeping."


164
00:06:57.035 --> 00:06:59.035
I was like, "I'm so glad
we traveled together."


165
00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:02.243
And so... and so I went off
to do my show.


166
00:07:02.327 --> 00:07:04.327
I was so excited
because I was like fucking


167
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.243
weed legal Washington.

168
00:07:05.327 --> 00:07:07.327
I'm gonna get to fucking
do a show there.


169
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.951
They're gonna let me fucking
smoke weed onstage


170
00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:13.993
while I do my show. That is not
the case at all, man.


171
00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:16.868
They got all sorts of fucking
even more rigid laws and shit


172
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:17.993
like that where you
can't do that.


173
00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:20.410
So much so that I was
at the place between gigs,


174
00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:22.202
I told the management,
I was like, "Hey, man.


175
00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:23.993
So I got like an hour to kill
between gigs.


176
00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:25.868
I'm gonna go in the green room
and make it green.


177
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:27.077
You know what I'm saying?"

178
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.701
And he's like, "No, you're not,
you animal.


179
00:07:27.785 --> 00:07:30.243
You do that outside."

180
00:07:30.327 --> 00:07:34.327
I was like, "Fucking liberal
Washington." You know...


181
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.577
So I went outside to smoke,
but there were people lined up


182
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.077
for the next show. I didn't
wanna be like a Walmart greeter


183
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.118
at my own show
where, you know...


184
00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:46.868
I'm like, "Hi, how are you?
Welcome.


185
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.619
Yes, it is me." You know.

186
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.494
So I was like fuck it,
I'll go back to the hotel.


187
00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:53.035
Hotel's close,
it was like literally


188
00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:54.327
across the street and shit.

189
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.494
So I was like
I'll go back there.


190
00:07:55.577 --> 00:07:57.118
And I went back
to the hotel room,


191
00:07:57.202 --> 00:07:58.785
'cause I was like I'll smoke
on the balcony.


192
00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:03.035
But when I walked in the room,
like my wife had set up shop,


193
00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:06.285
like in a big, bad way.
She had made the place her own.


194
00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:08.701
She had, uh,
she was on the balcony,


195
00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:11.660
she had taken the mattress
off the bed


196
00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:14.452
and moved it over a chair
on the balcony


197
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:18.660
to create this kind of
chaise lounge affair.


198
00:08:18.743 --> 00:08:21.035
And she was laying on it
like the Queen of Sheba,


199
00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:23.243
reading a thick-ass book.

200
00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:27.202
And she had this big-ass
goblet of wine in her hand.


201
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:28.494
And the bottle looked empty.

202
00:08:28.577 --> 00:08:32.243
I gauged her to be about
four glasses into Spokane


203
00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:33.327
at this point.

204
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.910
Because she was saying
stupid shit like,


205
00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:37.951
"I could live here."
You know.


206
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.494
I've been with the woman

207
00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:44.118
I know she couldn't fucking
live there, man.


208
00:08:44.202 --> 00:08:46.160
So, you know, she said,
"What are you doing here?"


209
00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:48.077
I was like,
"I'm between gigs, man.


210
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.494
They wouldn't let me smoke
at the club,


211
00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:52.118
so I came here
to smoke on the balcony, man,


212
00:08:52.202 --> 00:08:53.785
and see you." And she goes,
"Well, Jesus,


213
00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:55.660
I'm reading my book, Kevin.
I don't wanna get


214
00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:58.826
into a big conversation
about your night."


215
00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:06.035
And I was like, "I don't fucking
need to talk to you."


216
00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:07.035
I was like, "I was just
with like 200 people


217
00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:10.410
who paid me money
to hear me talk.


218
00:09:11.577 --> 00:09:14.535
So that's fucking cool.
Like, you don't have...


219
00:09:14.619 --> 00:09:16.285
we don't have to get
in a conversation."


220
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:18.619
She goes, "I know you.
After a show, you get home


221
00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:20.077
and you're Mr. Storytime,

222
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.494
and you gotta tell all
your stories and shit."


223
00:09:21.577 --> 00:09:25.160
I was like, "I have no fucking
stories to tell, man."


224
00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:26.951
I was like, "Tell you what,
you sit there and fucking


225
00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:29.243
drink and read your book,
and I'll stand over here


226
00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:32.327
and fucking smoke my weed
and we'll be together alone."


227
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.951
You know. 'Cause that's what
fucking marriage is. Go.


228
00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:38.452
You know.
So I just sat there smoking,


229
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:39.619
and she was reading her book.

230
00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:43.202
And the problem is when I smoke,
that's when I get chatty.


231
00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:45.494
So...

232
00:09:47.743 --> 00:09:50.327
So I was standing there,
I was like...


233
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.535
I was like,
"Did I fucking tell you...


234
00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:56.369
what happened to me the last
time I was on a balcony


235
00:09:56.452 --> 00:09:59.785
smoking weed?" And she slams
the book closed.


236
00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:03.494
She goes, "I knew it,
storytime!"


237
00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:06.410
I was like, "No, this ain't--
I mean, yes, it's a story.


238
00:10:06.494 --> 00:10:08.410
But it's not long.
It's very short."


239
00:10:08.494 --> 00:10:11.619
So I'm only reminded
because I'm sitting here smoking


240
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:12.743
on the balcony, it's nice
with a view and shit.


241
00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:15.327
We're on the second floor.
I said, But last weekend,


242
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.410
I was in Arizona,
I was in fucking Phoenix.


243
00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:21.660
And I was smoking on a balcony,
but I was five floors up.


244
00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:22.660
And it was a city view,

245
00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:23.993
it wasn't as pretty
as this and stuff.


246
00:10:24.077 --> 00:10:27.619
And, like, unlike today, I got
this great Washington weed,


247
00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:29.452
I was in Arizona,
I was at the mercy


248
00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:31.369
of fucking local weed and stuff.

249
00:10:31.452 --> 00:10:34.243
So I was smoking on my balcony,
like, "This is nothing.


250
00:10:34.327 --> 00:10:35.452
This shit ain't
gonna do anything."


251
00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.452
Being a real weed snob
about it.


252
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:40.077
And then about halfway
through the joint,


253
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.035
I was telling my wife,
I was like,


254
00:10:41.118 --> 00:10:42.785
I started hearing voices,
and I was like,


255
00:10:42.868 --> 00:10:44.660
"Hey, this shit's fucking good,
man. Like..."


256
00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:47.327
I got too judgy about Arizona.
And then I looked over


257
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.285
the balcony and I saw
that five feet down,


258
00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:55.160
five floors down, rather, was
people on the street talking.


259
00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:56.951
There was a gaggle of women,
older ladies.


260
00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:59.202
And they were talking.
And I could hear them.


261
00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:00.785
I couldn't hear what
they were enunciating,


262
00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:02.743
but I could hear them talking
from where I was.


263
00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:04.535
And I started getting fucking
freaking paranoid.


264
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:06.077
'Cause I was like,
if I can hear them,


265
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.035
can they smell me right now?

266
00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:10.785
Like...

267
00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:13.785
So I'm looking over and I watch
the ladies cross the street,


268
00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:16.243
there was a crosswalk,
and they're crossing the street.


269
00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:17.826
And at the other side
of the crosswalk,


270
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.868
there's a callbox.

271
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:20.577
And at the callbox,
a guy in blue.


272
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.035
A fucking cop is standing
right there.


273
00:11:23.118 --> 00:11:24.452
And so my wife's like,
"Get out of here."


274
00:11:24.535 --> 00:11:25.619
I was like, there's a fucking
cop across the street.


275
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:27.743
I'm like, fuck the old ladies,
I should be worried


276
00:11:27.826 --> 00:11:28.868
about the cop and shit.

277
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:30.494
I said, but I still didn't
put my joint out, man.


278
00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:35.785
Like I just sat there,
I backed up a foot.


279
00:11:37.743 --> 00:11:41.410
And I was like, I'm gonna keep
my eye on this cop.


280
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.243
So... so I said,
so I'm standing there, man,


281
00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:49.035
watching, and the ladies
cross the street


282
00:11:49.118 --> 00:11:51.118
and get to the other side,
and I told my wife,


283
00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:53.160
I promise you, this is what
fucking happened.


284
00:11:53.243 --> 00:11:54.701
The cop was facing
the other way,


285
00:11:54.785 --> 00:11:57.452
I'm on the hotel balcony
over across the street.


286
00:11:57.535 --> 00:11:58.160
The cops crossing,
the ladies also,


287
00:11:58.243 --> 00:12:00.660
and he goes...

288
00:12:00.743 --> 00:12:04.202
And I was like there's no
fucking way that this guy


289
00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:05.535
fucking smells me.

290
00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:08.410
I still don't put the joint out,
though, man.


291
00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.410
I'm watching him, and this
is what he fucking does.


292
00:12:11.494 --> 00:12:12.327
He goes like this.

293
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.535
And he locks on
across the street,


294
00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:15.494
like where I am in the hotel,

295
00:12:15.577 --> 00:12:18.118
and all of a sudden
he goes like this.


296
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.910
And he's experienced,
this cop, man.


297
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:26.910
He's like, "Somebody's
smoking on a balcony."


298
00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:29.660
And he's going balcony
by balcony.


299
00:12:29.743 --> 00:12:31.701
And I'm fucking frozen.
I don't move.


300
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:34.452
'Cause it's like this reverse
Space Invaders game,


301
00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:37.993
where he's getting
fucking closer.


302
00:12:38.077 --> 00:12:39.868
And I'm at the center of it
and stuff.


303
00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:41.785
And he's on the fourth floor,
where I'm like,


304
00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:44.285
oh, fuck, I'm next!

305
00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.494
So then he gets up to me
and he locks onto me.


306
00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:49.077
He goes like this and shit,
and he goes, "That!"


307
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
And I said, my first fucking
instinct wasn't to like


308
00:12:52.243 --> 00:12:53.785
drop the joint
or fucking, like,


309
00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:56.660
run to the airport.
I said, my first instinct


310
00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.369
was to go like this,
I went...


311
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:06.535
I said, so the fucking guy
goes like this.


312
00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.452
And then he reaches back.
And I'm like,


313
00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:12.160
I'm gonna get shot
on this balcony.


314
00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:14.452
My fucking story ends
with getting killed


315
00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:15.619
on a balcony in Arizona

316
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:17.452
for smoking local
low-grade weed, man.


317
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.285
And... which did have
a kick to it.


318
00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:21.327
So I was sitting there going,

319
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.868
what the fuck's gonna
happen next?


320
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:24.410
And he pulls out a phone.

321
00:13:24.494 --> 00:13:26.785
Then the dude kind of
illuminated


322
00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:29.285
the whole fucking thing,
all of a sudden he goes,


323
00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:31.535
"Silent Bob!"

324
00:13:31.619 --> 00:13:33.951
And I was like, "Oh, fuck!
He's a fan, man!"


325
00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:44.868
I was so fucking relieved.
I was like, "Hi!"


326
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.743
And he goes, pointing
at his phone, he goes,


327
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:50.743
"I want to take a picture
with you!"


328
00:13:50.826 --> 00:13:53.826
I was like, "Oh, okay!
I'm gonna come right down!


329
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.826
Stay there,
I'll take a picture!"


330
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.202
So I run inside,
I change every fucking piece


331
00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:00.660
of clothing I have on.

332
00:14:00.743 --> 00:14:02.785
Everything. I take
the hotel shampoo,


333
00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:04.743
I dab it on my ears and stuff.
Just...


334
00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.743
Get the scent away.
And I said, I told my wife,


335
00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:09.327
I went downstairs, I said,
I met the dude.


336
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.660
He was lovely. I said,
it wasn't--


337
00:14:10.743 --> 00:14:13.077
It was very kosher, we took
pictures together and shit.


338
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.826
Chitchatted about the movies
and whatnot.


339
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.743
I said it was a wonderful
experience.


340
00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:19.452
I said the PS to the story is
he wasn't a cop.


341
00:14:19.535 --> 00:14:22.660
He just had a blue jacket on.
And that was it.


342
00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:33.701
Now...

343
00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:36.868
My wife, God love her, man.
We've been together,


344
00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:39.619
last week, we met 20 years ago
last week.


345
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:43.951
We've been in each other's lives
for 20 years.


346
00:14:44.035 --> 00:14:46.577
-Thank you. Um...

347
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.410
Met... met 20 years ago
last week.


348
00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:53.452
Next month, it'll be 20 years
since the first time we fucked.


349
00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:55.660
And that's the more important
anniversary.


350
00:14:55.743 --> 00:14:58.077
But we've been together
for like two decades, man.


351
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.535
That's, you know, it's just
to tell you that


352
00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:04.743
her reactions to my stories,

353
00:15:04.826 --> 00:15:06.202
it's not like everybody here,

354
00:15:06.285 --> 00:15:07.910
where I'm like, you know,
tell that story


355
00:15:07.993 --> 00:15:09.743
and everyone's like,
"Oh, very witty, wild."


356
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:10.826
You know...

357
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.327
She's like, she's, you know,
fucking seen it all,


358
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.452
heard it all and shit
like that.


359
00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:17.035
Like, my wife loves me,
I know this.


360
00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:19.494
Don't get me fucking wrong.
She would kill anybody


361
00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.951
that fucking threatened me
and cut the jugular and shit.


362
00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:24.494
But she is not what I would call
by any stretch


363
00:15:24.577 --> 00:15:30.619
of the imagination
a Kevin Smith fan.


364
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:33.160
Jay and Silent Bob,
not her fucking thing


365
00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:34.701
or anything like that.
She's like,


366
00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:37.160
"I'm glad you do those movies,
they let you run around


367
00:15:37.243 --> 00:15:40.701
and you get exercise."
Like that's...


368
00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:42.826
Case in point, man,
we got this TV show


369
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.951
called Comic Book Men,
it's in its seventh season


370
00:15:45.035 --> 00:15:47.118
-at this point. Thank you.

371
00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:50.494
Thank you.

372
00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:52.243
Um, I don't tell you that
to be like,


373
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.660
"Seven seasons, look at my big,
fat TV dick!" Like...


374
00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:57.243
Not at all.
It has nothing to do with us.


375
00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:00.285
We follow one of the most
watched programs on the planet,


376
00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:02.410
The Walking Dead.
So if anything,


377
00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:05.160
it's fucking Robert Kirkman's
big TV dick,


378
00:16:05.243 --> 00:16:08.993
and we just surf on it
till midnight.


379
00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.327
So I only tell you seven
seasons 'cause


380
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.410
to communicate there's
like 80 some odd episodes


381
00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:17.785
of this show
that you could watch.


382
00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:18.660
And I'm on every one of them.

383
00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:22.785
My wife has seen two
of the episodes.


384
00:16:22.868 --> 00:16:25.369
She saw the pilot episode,
we shot it, put it together.


385
00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:26.993
I showed it to her.
I was like, what do you think?


386
00:16:27.077 --> 00:16:29.535
And her review was,
"I can't believe


387
00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:32.951
you tricked somebody
into paying you


388
00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:37.993
to be on TV and talk
to your fucking friends."


389
00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:42.035
Which I felt was
a very strong review. Um...


390
00:16:42.118 --> 00:16:46.619
Then, like, four seasons later,
my daughter was on the show.


391
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:48.160
Harley was on the show.
So I told my wife,


392
00:16:48.243 --> 00:16:49.619
I was like, "You gotta watch
an episode now.


393
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:52.243
Something came out of your
body's on the fucking show.


394
00:16:52.327 --> 00:16:54.577
So..." So she watched
the episode.


395
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.577
I was like, "What'd you think?"
She goes,


396
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.327
"Harley was a vast improvement."
You know.


397
00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:01.701
She keeps it very real.

398
00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:06.577
The show is on a night that
we watch two other programs.


399
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.077
Like, in our bedroom.
We watch The Walking Dead


400
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.410
and then we watch Talking Dead.

401
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:12.993
And at the end
of the Talking Dead,


402
00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:14.243
there's a fellow looks strangely
like me


403
00:17:14.327 --> 00:17:17.118
who will pop up and be like,
"Hey! Stick around for more


404
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.243
hijinks on Comic Book Men."

405
00:17:19.327 --> 00:17:20.993
And that's when my wife grabs
the remote and goes,


406
00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:24.327
"We're going to bed."
And shuts that shit off.


407
00:17:26.701 --> 00:17:27.993
Now I gotta tell you,
this is gonna be weird,


408
00:17:28.077 --> 00:17:30.285
but I gotta tell you
this story to tell you


409
00:17:30.369 --> 00:17:31.868
the rest of the story,
and at first you're gonna be


410
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:35.410
all judgy and then I'm gonna
tell you something


411
00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:36.785
and then you'll be like,
"Oh, that makes sense."


412
00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:39.868
Um, I have a 103-inch television
in my bedroom.


413
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:44.327
Uh, that's not the judgy part.
Here it comes.


414
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.743
It cost 60 thousand
fucking bucks.


415
00:17:46.826 --> 00:17:49.826
Crazy, right?
I didn't fucking buy it.


416
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.619
I would never pay 60--
Now, you can't be judgy.


417
00:17:51.701 --> 00:17:54.369
I would never...
I didn't buy it.


418
00:17:54.452 --> 00:17:57.410
It was given to me, man.
I would never pay $60,000


419
00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.410
for a TV. I wouldn't pay
$60,000 for anything,


420
00:17:59.494 --> 00:18:00.910
unless you could live in it,
drive it,


421
00:18:00.993 --> 00:18:03.452
or it fucking blew you
until the day you die.


422
00:18:03.535 --> 00:18:04.619
Like, that's...

423
00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:07.701
I got a line and shit like that.
No, it was given to us


424
00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:10.993
at one point. I had done
commercials years ago


425
00:18:11.077 --> 00:18:12.077
for Panasonic.

426
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.993
And there was a guy named
Ed Janda who was, like,


427
00:18:14.077 --> 00:18:15.660
the exec at Panasonic
who was on set all the time.


428
00:18:15.743 --> 00:18:19.118
He loved movies.
Sweet fucking dude, man.


429
00:18:19.202 --> 00:18:20.452
I've known him for years
and stuff.


430
00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.202
One day, he fucking called me.
Been to my house many times.


431
00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:24.826
He called me out of the blue
and he goes,


432
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.118
"Hey, man. We've got this

433
00:18:29.202 --> 00:18:31.035
that we're gonna throw out,
man.


434
00:18:31.118 --> 00:18:34.701
And I remember you've got big,
wide walls


435
00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:35.701
and huge ceilings
in your house."


436
00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:38.993
And I was like,
"What a weird fucking way


437
00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.202
to start a conversation.

438
00:18:41.285 --> 00:18:43.868
What do all these things
have to do with each other, man?


439
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:45.910
Is that all our friendship
was to you?


440
00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.701
Square fucking footage?" Like...

441
00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:50.118
And he goes, "No, the reason
I bring it together


442
00:18:50.202 --> 00:18:51.951
is this TV we're gonna fucking
throw out, it's 103 inches,


443
00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:53.826
and, fuck, it won't fit
in many places.


444
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.285
But it'll definitely fit
in your house.


445
00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:57.701
So if you want it, we're just
gonna give it to you for free.


446
00:18:57.785 --> 00:18:59.619
Do you want it?"
I was like, "Fuck yeah!


447
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.951
Give me all your garbage! Yes!

448
00:19:03.035 --> 00:19:05.035
Fuck yes!" I was like,
"What's wrong with it, man?


449
00:19:05.118 --> 00:19:07.410
Was it assembled on an ancient
Indian burial ground?


450
00:19:07.494 --> 00:19:09.701
Is it cursed?" Like...

451
00:19:09.785 --> 00:19:10.701
And he goes, "No, they used it
for the Olympics.


452
00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:13.035
It was for coverage
for the Olympics.


453
00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.452
So it's not meant
for home use.


454
00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:17.701
It's basically big graphics TV
where they point to like,


455
00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:19.202
'This is what happened,'
and shit like that.


456
00:19:19.285 --> 00:19:21.327
Problem is it has no speakers.

457
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.202
So you'd have to buy speakers."
I was like,


458
00:19:22.285 --> 00:19:25.035
"I'll buy
the fucking speakers, man!


459
00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:28.160
For a free 103
Fuck the speakers.


460
00:19:28.243 --> 00:19:30.327
I'll stand next to it
and translate


461
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.077
for whoever's watching!"
Like...


462
00:19:34.868 --> 00:19:36.910
I was like, "Fuck yes, man."
So he goes, "Okay, man.


463
00:19:36.993 --> 00:19:38.369
Make sure you're gonna
be home tomorrow.


464
00:19:38.452 --> 00:19:39.910
We can have it delivered."
He's going,


465
00:19:39.993 --> 00:19:41.785
"You gotta clear your street."
And I said, "Why?"


466
00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:45.077
He goes, "It comes
on an 18-wheeler."


467
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.826
I said, "Really?"
And he goes, "Yeah.


468
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.160
It takes ten people
to deliver it."


469
00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:50.785
And I said, "Why?"
And he goes,


470
00:19:50.868 --> 00:19:54.243
"The base alone
weighs 2,000 pounds."


471
00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:55.910
Oh!
-So I was like,


472
00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:57.077
"I don't believe this."
And they showed up


473
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.910
the next day with
a giant fucking truck,


474
00:19:58.993 --> 00:20:00.577
pulled this thing out
the back, it looked like


475
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.160
the monolith from

476
00:20:04.243 --> 00:20:06.619
Ten fucking people
carrying it, man.


477
00:20:06.701 --> 00:20:07.535
They were like,
"Where do you want it?"


478
00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:10.035
I was like,
"Second floor, please."


479
00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:17.369
I felt bad, but I tipped
insanely well. So...


480
00:20:17.452 --> 00:20:18.785
Brought 'em up to my bedroom.
They're like,


481
00:20:18.868 --> 00:20:21.035
"Where's it go?" I said,
"Put it right


482
00:20:21.118 --> 00:20:23.035
at the foot of our bed, please."

483
00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:24.785
And my wife is like,
"Are you fucking high?"


484
00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:27.118
I was like, "Yes, but that has
nothing to do with this.


485
00:20:27.202 --> 00:20:28.077
This just makes sense."
I was like, "This is where


486
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.202
the TV was,
look at this big, wide wall.


487
00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:32.410
We'll put the fucking TV
right there."


488
00:20:32.494 --> 00:20:34.826
She goes, "Kevin, there's no
room between the bed


489
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.327
and the television."
I was like, "Yes, there is.


490
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.035
Look."

491
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.118
She's going, "What the fuck?

492
00:20:41.202 --> 00:20:42.660
How are we gonna
live like this?


493
00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:43.910
How are we gonna sleep?"
I was like,


494
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.327
"We fucking slept enough, man."

495
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.452
I was like, "Look at this thing.
This is our god now." Like...


496
00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:54.160
So if you're in my bedroom
and you're sitting on the edge


497
00:20:54.243 --> 00:20:56.077
of my bed and you're
tying your shoes,


498
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.660
you get up, you go,
"One, two..."


499
00:20:57.743 --> 00:20:59.993
You're on the fucking TV.

500
00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:03.577
So we have this massive TV
in my bedroom,


501
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.660
and I've never seen
Comic Book Men  on it.


502
00:21:07.743 --> 00:21:11.660
So one night, I said that I
wanted to watch it.


503
00:21:11.743 --> 00:21:14.369
Like, you know,
tried to test the waters.


504
00:21:14.452 --> 00:21:17.868
And... and so I told my wife,
I was like,


505
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:21.202
"Hey, man, um, I wanna watch
Comic Book Men


506
00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:24.077
on the big TV tonight
for the first time.


507
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.369
Like, that's cool, right?"

508
00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:29.118
And she goes, "Oh, we don't
watch that show in here."


509
00:21:30.993 --> 00:21:33.910
And I was like,
"I know. I know.


510
00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:36.410
You know, which is weird
'cause it pays for everything.


511
00:21:36.494 --> 00:21:38.910
But whatever. Like...

512
00:21:40.285 --> 00:21:42.452
But tonight's special. It's the
end of the fourth season.


513
00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.118
We just found out we're getting
picked up for a fifth season.


514
00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:48.369
So I wanna like live tweet
the show from in here."


515
00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:50.826
Normally, I do it in my office.
I watch it on a laptop.


516
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.160
I was like, "I'd love
to watch it on the big TV.


517
00:21:52.243 --> 00:21:53.243
I wanna live tweet,
send pictures."


518
00:21:53.327 --> 00:21:56.035
And my wife's like,
"Why do you need pictures?"


519
00:21:56.118 --> 00:21:57.410
And I was like,
"I don't wanna tell you


520
00:21:57.494 --> 00:21:59.452
'cause you're gonna fucking
make fun of me and shit."


521
00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:00.202
And she was like,
"You have to tell me


522
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:03.701
'cause I control
the television."


523
00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:05.743
So I said, "Okay."
I said, "I've never seen


524
00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:07.077
my show on the TV,
but the TV's fucking big.


525
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.077
It's taller than me
when I stand next to it."


526
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.035
It's 103 inches wide.
But it's fucking about six...


527
00:22:13.118 --> 00:22:15.910
six-three tall from the ground
with the base.


528
00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:18.035
I was like, "So when
you see people on it,


529
00:22:18.118 --> 00:22:19.410
they look life-sized.

530
00:22:19.494 --> 00:22:22.993
And I've always wanted to like
watch Comic Book Men,


531
00:22:23.077 --> 00:22:25.452
and when I came on the screen,

532
00:22:25.535 --> 00:22:28.327
pause it...

533
00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:37.410
and then go stand next
to myself."


534
00:22:45.785 --> 00:22:47.452
She goes, "Why?"
I'm like, "To take a selfie."


535
00:22:47.535 --> 00:22:49.160
You know.

536
00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:50.993
And she looked at me
with that fucking look


537
00:22:51.077 --> 00:22:52.951
of disdain like,
"I can't believe I let you


538
00:22:53.035 --> 00:22:56.701
stick your fucking dick in me."

539
00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:58.494
She goes, "No,
you watch that in the office."


540
00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.910
I was like, "Come on, man.
This is fucked up.


541
00:23:00.993 --> 00:23:02.951
Don't you think
it's fucking crazy


542
00:23:03.035 --> 00:23:04.743
that we're fucking this deep
into a show


543
00:23:04.826 --> 00:23:07.619
that I'm on every episode of
and you don't watch it?"


544
00:23:07.701 --> 00:23:08.951
And she goes,
"Why would I watch it?"


545
00:23:09.035 --> 00:23:09.868
And I was like,
"I don't know, man.


546
00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:11.910
Like, 'cause I'm on the show."

547
00:23:11.993 --> 00:23:13.452
And she goes,
"Well, it's not like


548
00:23:13.535 --> 00:23:17.410
I'm in the Kevin Smith
demographic, now am I?"


549
00:23:17.494 --> 00:23:21.035
And I said,
"You fuck Kevin Smith!


550
00:23:21.868 --> 00:23:22.951
If you're not
in the demographic,


551
00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:26.826
it's in you from time to time!"

552
00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:31.826
And she was like, "I could see
this really fucking upsets you."


553
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.826
I was like, "I think it's
fucking weird, man.


554
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.993
If you were on a TV show,
I would have watched


555
00:23:36.077 --> 00:23:37.410
every fucking episode and shit.

556
00:23:37.494 --> 00:23:38.577
But you don't watch the show
that I'm on."


557
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.202
And she goes, "Jesus, Kevin,
if I really wanna see you


558
00:23:41.285 --> 00:23:45.118
fucking cry about Batman
and wear that jersey,


559
00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:47.452
I'll look to my left."

560
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.077
So that's a long way
of fucking saying


561
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.202
that like she's over
my bullshit.


562
00:23:56.285 --> 00:23:59.951
Like, you know.
This is her idea of hell.


563
00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:02.660
Like being forced to sit
there and listen to Kevin Smith.


564
00:24:02.743 --> 00:24:05.577
Like, she doesn't
understand you people.


565
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.743
So, uh...

566
00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:12.285
So, you know, when I was on
the balcony in Spokane,


567
00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:17.369
telling her the story
about the balcony in Phoenix,


568
00:24:17.452 --> 00:24:21.535
I didn't expect her to have
the reaction you guys had.


569
00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:23.951
But she fucking surprised me.

570
00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:25.410
As previously mentioned,

571
00:24:25.494 --> 00:24:29.285
she was about four glasses
into Spokane.


572
00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:31.826
So she looks at me
with bedroom eyes,


573
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.577
and she goes, "You're cute."

574
00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:38.369
And this never fucking happens.

575
00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.660
And-- but I knew
what it was about.


576
00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:42.369
And I was like, "Really?"
She goes, "Yeah.


577
00:24:42.452 --> 00:24:46.243
Whenever you tell a story,
you wave your hands all around."


578
00:24:46.327 --> 00:24:47.160
She's like, "It's cute."

579
00:24:47.243 --> 00:24:51.202
So I fucking look at my time
and shit,


580
00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:54.327
and I've got ten minutes
until the next show.


581
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.202
And then I look from the balcony
to across the street,


582
00:24:57.285 --> 00:25:00.619
see what kind of geography
I gotta face to get there,


583
00:25:00.701 --> 00:25:05.327
and then I start doing
the sexual math in my head.


584
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.619
And so I was like,
"How cute?"


585
00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:13.826
And she goes, "Real cute.
What do you want?"


586
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.619
And I was like, "I don't know,
cute enough to get blown


587
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.327
before the next show?"

588
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.910
And she goes,
"Oh, my God, Kevin,


589
00:25:19.993 --> 00:25:22.410
you could never cum that fast."

590
00:25:22.494 --> 00:25:24.743
Which sounds like another
fucking criticism,


591
00:25:24.826 --> 00:25:27.077
but it's based
on empirical wisdom.


592
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.369
This is weird, I gotta tell you.
This story--


593
00:25:28.452 --> 00:25:30.077
Tell you the rest of this story.

594
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.369
And all the other stories
are mine,


595
00:25:31.452 --> 00:25:33.868
but this is my wife's story
and it's personal.


596
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:36.452
But like nothing will make sense
unless I tell you this.


597
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:40.826
Um, my wife is... I don't know
how else to describe it.


598
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.868
She's the most easily orgasmic
human being I've ever met


599
00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:47.826
in my entire life.

600
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.202
Uh, it does not take much.

601
00:25:50.285 --> 00:25:53.785
Some people are a lot of work,
my wife is not a lot of work.


602
00:25:53.868 --> 00:25:57.826
I could be standing
across the room,


603
00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.285
leaning on a wall,

604
00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:00.785
and she could be on the
other side of the room,


605
00:26:00.868 --> 00:26:03.910
on the bed, laying down,
wearing, you know,


606
00:26:03.993 --> 00:26:05.785
a pair of sweatpants.

607
00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:09.619
And all I have to do is go...

608
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:12.910
And by the time the fucking
butterfly effect hits her crotch


609
00:26:12.993 --> 00:26:16.285
she's like, "Oh!"

610
00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:19.243
It's crazy. It's wonderful, man.
It's fantastic.


611
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:20.910
Like, when we first met, that
was one of the first things


612
00:26:20.993 --> 00:26:22.327
I learned about her and shit.
I was like,


613
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.660
"Oh, my God! She can cum
so fucking easily!


614
00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:28.494
I'll never work again!
Like, this... this is nuts."


615
00:26:28.577 --> 00:26:29.951
First time we were ever
together, man,


616
00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:31.369
like she rolled me on my back
at one point,


617
00:26:31.452 --> 00:26:33.285
like I was trying to make
the moves and shit.


618
00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:34.160
And she threw me on my back
and got on top.


619
00:26:34.243 --> 00:26:35.660
She's like, "I like it
being on top!"


620
00:26:35.743 --> 00:26:39.410
I was like, "That's where you'll
stay for the rest of our lives."


621
00:26:39.494 --> 00:26:41.494
That's still how we fuck
to this day and shit.


622
00:26:41.577 --> 00:26:43.327
And unlike anyone else
I've ever had sex with,


623
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.160
she was going buckwild
and shit like that.


624
00:26:46.243 --> 00:26:47.910
I was like fucking impressed
with myself.


625
00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:50.494
I was like, "Is this shit me?"
She's like, "Fuck no!"


626
00:26:50.577 --> 00:26:52.160
You know.

627
00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:54.410
It has nothing to do with me.
It's not like I'm walking around


628
00:26:54.494 --> 00:26:58.118
going, "I sling a magic dick."
Not at all.


629
00:26:58.202 --> 00:27:01.077
She's just like-- I'm like
basically a scratching post


630
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.826
and she's a cat, and she just
does shit. You know?


631
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.535
And then fucks off
and stuff like that.


632
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.410
So because I learned early on
in the relationship


633
00:27:10.494 --> 00:27:13.993
she could crank out a few,
multiple orgasms,


634
00:27:14.077 --> 00:27:15.202
it had nothing to do with me,
again.


635
00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.243
She just needs a warm body
and friction, shit like that.


636
00:27:17.327 --> 00:27:20.202
So since she could
crank out a few,


637
00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:21.452
I was like, "Oh, fuck.
I'll try to hold out


638
00:27:21.535 --> 00:27:23.452
for as long as I can."
'Cause I get one shot.


639
00:27:23.535 --> 00:27:27.660
I don't get like fucking
five nuts to bust and shit.


640
00:27:27.743 --> 00:27:30.035
I get one, I'm 47,
like one a week.


641
00:27:30.118 --> 00:27:32.202
So, like, at the end
of the day, man,


642
00:27:32.285 --> 00:27:34.535
I try to hold onto it because
once it's over, it's over.


643
00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:37.743
I'm like Luke Skywalker
bombing the Death Star.


644
00:27:37.826 --> 00:27:40.369
Like...  You know.

645
00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:43.452
Shit blows up and I take
the fuck off. You know?


646
00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:44.660
Every once in a while,
she's like,


647
00:27:44.743 --> 00:27:46.535
"You wanna fuck again?"
Like, five minutes later.


648
00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.452
I'm like, "Yeah, man.
Wednesday, let's do it.


649
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:52.619
I'll have built it up again
and stuff."


650
00:27:52.701 --> 00:27:55.410
So I try to hold out
for as long as I can


651
00:27:55.494 --> 00:27:57.660
because she seems to be
enjoying herself.


652
00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:58.619
'Cause she can get a few
fucking orgasms done.


653
00:27:58.701 --> 00:28:00.951
And when I say hold out
as long as I can,


654
00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:04.160
mind you, this is literally
about four to six minutes.


655
00:28:04.243 --> 00:28:07.035
She gets a lot done in that
fucking time and whatnot.


656
00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:08.410
So, you know, I just hold out
until she's like,


657
00:28:08.494 --> 00:28:11.077
"Will you fucking cum already?"
You know.


658
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.910
And then I'm like,
"It's my special time." So...


659
00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.951
So her experience
is based on that.


660
00:28:17.035 --> 00:28:18.660
I never fucking told her
that I could cum real fast.


661
00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:22.701
When I'm by myself,
I cum like a fucking pro, man.


662
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:25.243
Like, real fucking fast
and shit.


663
00:28:25.327 --> 00:28:26.619
I'm real good at it. Had years
of practice and whatnot.


664
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:31.243
So... so she-- when she said,
"You could never cum that fast,"


665
00:28:31.327 --> 00:28:33.118
this is based
on empirical knowledge.


666
00:28:33.202 --> 00:28:34.035
But I was like, "Oh, no."

667
00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:35.327
I said, "I know what
you're thinking."


668
00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.452
I said, "But I can
cum very fast.


669
00:28:36.535 --> 00:28:39.327
When I'm by myself,
I cum very fucking fast.


670
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.327
Like, I swear, if you
wanna give it a shot,


671
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.494
I could totally pull this off
in under five minutes."


672
00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:47.494
And so she fucking takes
her glass of wine


673
00:28:47.577 --> 00:28:49.619
and she fucking throws it back,
she puts the glass down,


674
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:51.868
and she stands and she looks
at me and she goes,


675
00:28:51.951 --> 00:28:55.743
"Lay down on that bed
and pull down your jorts."


676
00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:03.327
Which really should have fucking
turned me off, man.


677
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.701
Like... but I was like,
"Fuck it."


678
00:29:05.785 --> 00:29:08.410
I ran over to the bed
and fucking yanked my jorts down


679
00:29:08.494 --> 00:29:10.452
and just presented and shit.

680
00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:12.910
And there was nothing romantic
about it or sexy.


681
00:29:12.993 --> 00:29:15.285
She didn't put on any music
or any shit like that.


682
00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:17.577
She just got to the fucking bed
and like fucking


683
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.701
got down and was just like...

684
00:29:25.202 --> 00:29:26.619
'Cause she's been
through it before.


685
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:27.660
We've known each other 20 years

686
00:29:27.743 --> 00:29:29.077
we've been doing shit
to each other and stuff.


687
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.785
So she's like,
"I know what this is gonna be.


688
00:29:30.868 --> 00:29:32.160
Fucking it's gonna take him
forever."


689
00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:35.910
But she hadn't met
her real husband. You know?


690
00:29:35.993 --> 00:29:37.993
And she was about to
and shit like that.


691
00:29:38.077 --> 00:29:40.619
It was very-- it was rote.
It wasn't romantic.


692
00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:42.785
It was clinical.
It was perfunctory.


693
00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:43.868
It was almost like...

694
00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:47.035
like the owl in the
Tootsie Roll Pop commercial.


695
00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:49.743
Like, "How many fucking licks
is this gonna take, man?"


696
00:29:49.826 --> 00:29:52.577
I was like, "Fucking three,
I assure you."


697
00:29:54.535 --> 00:29:55.826
So she went for it,

698
00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.160
and fucking it was not
what she was expecting.


699
00:29:58.243 --> 00:30:00.743
And this is the sound
that my good lady wife


700
00:30:00.826 --> 00:30:04.868
of 19 years, the person I've
been intimate with for 20 years


701
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:08.951
made when she found out
who I really was


702
00:30:09.035 --> 00:30:12.910
hitting the back of her throat
at 95 miles per hour.


703
00:30:12.993 --> 00:30:16.660
This was the sound.

704
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.369
It was like I'd fucked
Scooby Doo


705
00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:30.660
in the mouth or something
like that.


706
00:30:30.743 --> 00:30:33.826
So she fucking gets up,
she runs into the bathroom


707
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.035
and I hear her go like...

708
00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:37.243
Because she loves me,
but not that fucking much.


709
00:30:37.327 --> 00:30:38.452
You know...

710
00:30:38.535 --> 00:30:40.410
Then she runs back in, she goes,
"What the fuck was that?"


711
00:30:40.494 --> 00:30:42.327
I was like, "I told you, man.
I can cum real fast


712
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.826
when I'm by myself, when I'm
really putting my mind to it


713
00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.243
and stuff like that."
She goes, "Jesus Christ, Kevin."


714
00:30:47.327 --> 00:30:49.410
She's all sad, she goes,
"Jesus Christ, Kevin.


715
00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:51.660
If I'd have known that you
could have cum that fast


716
00:30:51.743 --> 00:30:52.535
our entire fucking lives
together,


717
00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:56.327
I would have
blown you every day."


718
00:30:58.577 --> 00:31:01.868
And I was like,
"It's never too late."


719
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.202
So...

720
00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:12.202
So we've been together
like I said fucking 20 years,


721
00:31:12.285 --> 00:31:14.577
we've been married 19 years,
we have a marital contract,


722
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.285
of course, but at the end
of the day,


723
00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:17.494
we just added to it
fairly recently.


724
00:31:17.577 --> 00:31:20.951
Little paragraph,
a subsection that says,


725
00:31:21.035 --> 00:31:25.494
um, if I can promise to cum
in under five minutes,


726
00:31:25.577 --> 00:31:28.118
she's morally obligated
to try to blow me.


727
00:31:28.202 --> 00:31:30.993
And we call it
the Spokane Amendment.


728
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:40.327
I don't wanna paint a picture
of her as like intolerant.


729
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.160
She's generally
a patient woman.


730
00:31:42.243 --> 00:31:45.868
Just not with me.

731
00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:48.285
But she stood by me. My
grandmother always used to say


732
00:31:48.369 --> 00:31:49.494
like when I had girlfriends
in high school,


733
00:31:49.577 --> 00:31:50.743
she was like, "They stood by you
when you were fat."


734
00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:54.035
And my wife has stood by me
when I've been fat.


735
00:31:54.118 --> 00:31:57.951
And then a few years ago, I
dropped a bunch of weight, man.


736
00:31:58.035 --> 00:31:59.660
I saw a documentary
called Fed Up.


737
00:31:59.743 --> 00:32:02.494
And it was about sugar.
And for the first time,


738
00:32:02.577 --> 00:32:04.327
like, I guess because
they used cartoons,


739
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.494
I understood sugar's eff--

740
00:32:06.577 --> 00:32:09.327
Sugar's effect on the body.
And I was like, "Oh, shit.


741
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.369
So I should stop eating
fucking sugar."


742
00:32:11.452 --> 00:32:13.743
And I did, and I lost
like 80 pounds and shit.


743
00:32:13.826 --> 00:32:15.951
-So it was a-
- Thank you.

744
00:32:16.035 --> 00:32:18.160
Um...

745
00:32:18.243 --> 00:32:22.535
It was-- if you could get past
the fucking desire for sugar,


746
00:32:22.619 --> 00:32:23.743
'cause it's very much
like a drug,


747
00:32:23.826 --> 00:32:26.035
and when you quit it
there's fucking withdrawal


748
00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:27.826
period and shit, where I was
insanely depressed.


749
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.494
For the first time in my life,
I was like I couldn't


750
00:32:30.577 --> 00:32:32.951
manufacture a fucking positive
thought and shit like that.


751
00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:34.826
My wife was like, "That's
because you got rid


752
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.868
of your best friend, sugar."

753
00:32:36.951 --> 00:32:38.327
I was like, "What do you mean?"
She was like, "Kevin,


754
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.494
you used to wake up and do
like two fucking fistfuls


755
00:32:40.577 --> 00:32:44.494
of popcorn-flavored
jelly beans.


756
00:32:44.577 --> 00:32:45.701
And then you'd be like,
'Where's breakfast?'"


757
00:32:45.785 --> 00:32:49.035
You know, so she's going,
"Sugar leaving your food pyramid


758
00:32:49.118 --> 00:32:52.369
is really affecting your body.
You're gonna have an adjustment.


759
00:32:52.452 --> 00:32:54.077
Like when Jason got off heroin
or something like that."


760
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.369
And so she's right, man. It was
fucking hard for two weeks.


761
00:32:58.452 --> 00:32:59.743
Like, it was easy once you got
past the two weeks


762
00:32:59.826 --> 00:33:00.910
and we didn't think
about it anymore.


763
00:33:00.993 --> 00:33:04.035
But in those first two weeks,
I would have sucked dick


764
00:33:04.118 --> 00:33:05.951
for Lucky Charms, man.

765
00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:10.535
I missed my good friend, sugar.
So as sugar went away,


766
00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:12.327
the weight just
kind of like fell off and stuff.


767
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.826
I didn't have to do anything.
I walked dogs.


768
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.910
I walked my dog up the hill.
It's not very far.


769
00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:19.202
It's like a mile and a half
up and down and shit.


770
00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:20.951
That's the only exercise I get.

771
00:33:21.035 --> 00:33:22.701
I do it in the neighborhood
adjacent.


772
00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.993
Mewes lives down the street
from me.


773
00:33:25.077 --> 00:33:26.285
We didn't buy houses
near each other.


774
00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:28.452
But he bought his house

775
00:33:28.535 --> 00:33:30.826
in my fucking neighborhood
and shit.


776
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.327
Every time we drive past
my kids, it's like,


777
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.077
"Aw, it's so cute that you live
near your best friend."


778
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.910
I was like, "He lives near me."

779
00:33:38.077 --> 00:33:40.077
Anyway, Jason comes over
sometimes.


780
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.118
We walk the dogs together
up the hill and stuff like that.


781
00:33:42.202 --> 00:33:45.243
And periodically, people drive
through the hills, they're like,


782
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:46.951
"Jay and Silent Bob
walk dogs."


783
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:52.077
So just dropping sugar
and fucking walking the dogs


784
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.785
like really made the difference
and the weight kind of fell off.


785
00:33:54.868 --> 00:33:58.160
And at one point, like my
underwear started sagging,


786
00:33:58.243 --> 00:33:59.577
because I used to wear
very big underwear.


787
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.785
Like fucking 5XL underwear
or something like that.


788
00:34:01.868 --> 00:34:02.826
So that shit started sagging

789
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:03.785
because the weight
kind of went away.


790
00:34:03.868 --> 00:34:08.243
And I-- my wife finally
took notice of it


791
00:34:08.327 --> 00:34:09.951
and was like,
"This is fucking shameful."


792
00:34:10.035 --> 00:34:11.910
She's like, "They just keep
falling off your body.


793
00:34:11.993 --> 00:34:13.785
And what we're seeing
isn't any better."


794
00:34:13.868 --> 00:34:15.660
You know, so... she's like,
"You gotta go fucking


795
00:34:15.743 --> 00:34:17.494
get some new underwear
and stuff.


796
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.494
And if you're gonna do it,

797
00:34:19.577 --> 00:34:21.785
don't buy fucking
maroon underwear."


798
00:34:21.868 --> 00:34:23.243
That's what I would wear
all the time.


799
00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:25.577
I had this maroon underwear,
'cause, you know,


800
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.826
I usually just get my shit
at fat guy store.


801
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.619
And they don't give you a lot
of fucking choices.


802
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:29.868
Now, they do.
Now, they put on like,


803
00:34:29.951 --> 00:34:32.785
"Hey, there's a Batman shirt
for you, fat guy."


804
00:34:32.868 --> 00:34:34.619
But generally speaking,
back in the day,


805
00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:37.619
it was like "big dog"
and shit like that.


806
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.535
Very generic but very
"I am overweight."


807
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.826
So I would get my underwear
at the fat guy store and shit


808
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.452
and they didn't have much
of a selection.


809
00:34:44.535 --> 00:34:45.660
It was always like
tighty-whiteys,


810
00:34:45.743 --> 00:34:46.826
that's what I wear and stuff.

811
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:49.243
I don't wear-- the
crimefighters, Jason calls them.


812
00:34:49.327 --> 00:34:52.826
Um, I don't-- I don't wear
boxers, just tighty-whiteys.


813
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.494
And so one time I went in
to the fucking fat guy store


814
00:34:55.577 --> 00:34:57.660
and they had,
next to the tighty-whiteys,


815
00:34:57.743 --> 00:34:59.243
the mot beautiful thing
I'd ever seen:


816
00:34:59.327 --> 00:35:02.202
underwear that was colored
and it was maroon.


817
00:35:02.285 --> 00:35:03.826
And I was like, "Oh, my God!

818
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.285
I'm gonna look like Superman
wearing this shit." You know?


819
00:35:07.369 --> 00:35:10.868
So I took it home and it
was a three-pack and shit.


820
00:35:10.951 --> 00:35:12.868
And I showed my wife.
I was like, "Look, man."


821
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:14.868
I was like, "You say I never
change anything and shit.


822
00:35:14.951 --> 00:35:16.910
But I went and bought
new underwear."


823
00:35:16.993 --> 00:35:18.701
And she goes, "Maroon?"

824
00:35:18.785 --> 00:35:20.327
And I was like, "Yeah."
She goes, "Why?"


825
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.826
And I was like, "I'm expressing
my individuality." You know?


826
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.035
And she goes, "Oh, my God.
Take these back."


827
00:35:26.118 --> 00:35:27.743
And I was like, "Fucking why?"
She was like,


828
00:35:27.826 --> 00:35:29.910
"Maroon underwear, Kevin?
I get a vote in this.


829
00:35:29.993 --> 00:35:32.369
I'm the only one that sees
your fucking underwear."


830
00:35:32.452 --> 00:35:33.243
You know. I was like,
"All right."


831
00:35:33.327 --> 00:35:35.327
So I went back
to the fat guy store.


832
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.285
I bought 12 more pair.
Fuck her. So...


833
00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:43.535
And every time we would
get intimate and shit,


834
00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.910
she's like open up my drawer
and be like, "Ugh! Maroon!"


835
00:35:45.993 --> 00:35:49.826
You know? It was a hurdle
to get through and shit.


836
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.327
So she was saying, "If you're
gonna get new underwear,


837
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.160
don't fucking get maroon."
I was like, "Maroon forever,"


838
00:35:55.243 --> 00:35:56.619
and shit.

839
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:58.410
So I was out on the road.
Where was I?


840
00:35:58.494 --> 00:36:01.118
I was in Kansas City.

841
00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:04.118
And so I had a little time
down between gigs and whatnot.


842
00:36:04.202 --> 00:36:05.202
So I was like,
I'm gonna go out shopping.


843
00:36:05.285 --> 00:36:08.035
And I asked them at the
front desk, I was like,


844
00:36:08.118 --> 00:36:09.160
"Hey, man, where do you got--
where do you got like


845
00:36:09.243 --> 00:36:12.369
the fat guy store?"
They're like, "Oh, you want


846
00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:13.910
to go to the
low-end strip mall."


847
00:36:13.993 --> 00:36:17.243
I was like, "Brother, I live
at the low-end strip mall, man."


848
00:36:17.327 --> 00:36:18.743
And I took a car there.

849
00:36:18.826 --> 00:36:21.327
I walked in and I was looking
for my maroons.


850
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.160
And I found them.
And then I saw


851
00:36:23.243 --> 00:36:24.369
the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen


852
00:36:24.452 --> 00:36:27.577
in a fat guy store:
a pair of black underwear.


853
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.785
And I was like, "Oh!
I'm gonna look like Batman!"


854
00:36:29.868 --> 00:36:33.369
You know, and I fucking...

855
00:36:33.452 --> 00:36:34.577
So I bought it
and I took it back


856
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.410
to the hotel room
and stuff like that.


857
00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.743
I was happy with my
fucking purchase.


858
00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:40.826
And so, you know,
I thought of my wife


859
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.785
and I was just like,
"Oh, fuck. I'm gonna tell her."


860
00:36:42.868 --> 00:36:44.077
And I said, "Hey, man.
Guess what I did today?"


861
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.743
You know, I was texting her.
She's like, "What?"


862
00:36:46.826 --> 00:36:48.577
I was like, "I went
underwear shopping."


863
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.118
And she goes, "Oh, great.
More maroon."


864
00:36:52.202 --> 00:36:54.243
And I said, "No, not maroon."

865
00:36:54.327 --> 00:36:57.785
And she goes, "What color?"
And I wrote, "Black!"


866
00:36:57.868 --> 00:37:00.327
A lot of exclamation points
and stuff.


867
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.035
And she sent emojis
of surprise and...


868
00:37:03.118 --> 00:37:05.660
And she goes,
"Send me a picture."


869
00:37:05.743 --> 00:37:08.118
And so I saw my opening.

870
00:37:10.035 --> 00:37:14.202
So I was like,
"You send me a picture, man."


871
00:37:14.285 --> 00:37:16.660
And she was like, "What of?"
And I was like, "You know."


872
00:37:16.743 --> 00:37:19.452
And she was like,
"You fucking pig."


873
00:37:19.535 --> 00:37:20.619
But we've been married
for a while,


874
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:22.951
so fucking three minutes later
a picture came through


875
00:37:23.035 --> 00:37:25.035
and shit like that.
And so it was a angle


876
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:27.577
of my wife's vagina,
and this is weird to say


877
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.951
because, again, we've been
together 20 years


878
00:37:29.035 --> 00:37:31.701
and we've had fucking sex
any way you can have sex.


879
00:37:31.785 --> 00:37:33.077
But it was an angle
of her vagina


880
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.494
that I'd never seen before.

881
00:37:35.577 --> 00:37:38.369
And I was like, "Oh, my God!
It's like a stranger's pussy."


882
00:37:38.452 --> 00:37:39.826
You know? And fucking...

883
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.743
So instantly I forgot
the conversation,


884
00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.951
took it right to the sink
and started tugging one out,


885
00:37:44.035 --> 00:37:45.494
looking right at it and shit.

886
00:37:45.577 --> 00:37:46.785
So I got finished and then
I wanted to get in the shower


887
00:37:46.868 --> 00:37:51.327
'cause I was sticky.
And so...


888
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.452
Took my black underwear
out of the pack.


889
00:37:53.535 --> 00:37:54.410
I laid them out
on the fucking blanket,


890
00:37:54.494 --> 00:37:56.535
there's like a white blanket
on the bed.


891
00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:59.494
So it really popped hard
and shit.


892
00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:02.118
And so I took a picture
and I wrote back,


893
00:38:02.202 --> 00:38:03.243
"Yes, bitch."

894
00:38:03.327 --> 00:38:07.701
I said, "Doesn't this
make you wet, motherfucker?"


895
00:38:09.743 --> 00:38:12.369
And I fucking hit send
and shit like that, man.


896
00:38:12.452 --> 00:38:16.160
And I hadn't fucking realized
that my wife


897
00:38:16.243 --> 00:38:20.327
was not the last person
that had sent me a text.


898
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.035
While I was in the shower,
somebody else had texted me


899
00:38:23.118 --> 00:38:25.993
and broken the conversation
with me and my wife


900
00:38:26.077 --> 00:38:29.868
and fucking the very shocked
recipient of my underwear text


901
00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:34.118
sent back a one-word response:
"Dad?"


902
00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:44.077
So some shit goes well beyond
a response text, you know.


903
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.701
I immediately fucking called her
up and I was like,


904
00:38:46.785 --> 00:38:49.243
"Oh, my God, kiddo.
You know that fucking text


905
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.660
was not meant for you.
It was meant for your mother.


906
00:38:51.743 --> 00:38:55.993
And by the way, no man should
ever talk to a lady like that."


907
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.202
I was fucking mortified, man.

908
00:39:06.285 --> 00:39:08.577
I was like, "Oh, my God.
Are you okay?"


909
00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.202
And she goes,
"You know I'm gonna need


910
00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:12.410
a lot of therapy, right?"

911
00:39:12.494 --> 00:39:15.285
I was like, "Yeah, but fucking
go ahead, we got the money.


912
00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:16.577
Go ahead."

913
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.577
I said, "But you gotta admit,
man, like, you know,


914
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.243
it's not the way you wanna find
out, but isn't it kinda nice


915
00:39:20.327 --> 00:39:23.785
to know that your parents,
after all that time,


916
00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:25.535
are like into one another,

917
00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:28.243
to send each other texts
like that?"


918
00:39:28.327 --> 00:39:30.619
I was looking for any
silver lining and shit


919
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.118
in the conversation.

920
00:39:32.202 --> 00:39:33.577
And she goes, "I was just
happy to see you've moved away


921
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.826
from maroon, Dad."

922
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.160
Uh, I just back from Vancouver.
I was up in Vancouver.


923
00:39:47.243 --> 00:39:49.951
I directed my third episode
of The Flash.


924
00:39:55.243 --> 00:39:57.285
It was fun. It was awesome, man.
I go up there,


925
00:39:57.369 --> 00:39:59.868
like, you know, in TV they don't
really need a director


926
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:00.826
in episodic TV.

927
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.868
Cast and crew make that show
every week.


928
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:04.826
If you ever look at the credits
of your favorite shows,


929
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.202
the director's the only name
that really changes and stuff.


930
00:40:07.285 --> 00:40:09.452
That's how fucking replaceable
the director really is.


931
00:40:09.535 --> 00:40:11.369
So the cast and crew makes your
favorite show every week.


932
00:40:11.452 --> 00:40:14.785
The director shows up and
is nominally in charge.


933
00:40:14.868 --> 00:40:16.452
But you can't really change
shit about it, man.


934
00:40:16.535 --> 00:40:19.701
Like you can't really walk in,
I couldn't walk into Flash


935
00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:22.410
and be like, "We're changing
the look of Flash  this week.


936
00:40:22.494 --> 00:40:24.910
It's all one shot,
back and white. Clerks."


937
00:40:24.993 --> 00:40:26.077
Like that's...

938
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.410
So it's weird, when I show up
I find myself at a loss.


939
00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:30.826
It's not like when I direct
a movie,


940
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.327
I'm involved in every aspect.

941
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.577
But on TV, I'm not really.

942
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.868
I'm kind of a bystander who gets
to say "action" and "cut."


943
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:39.035
But as a fan of the show,
it's fun


944
00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:40.785
'cause you get to watch
that shit get made.


945
00:40:40.868 --> 00:40:43.494
And I sit in on all the big
meetings and stuff like that.


946
00:40:43.577 --> 00:40:46.494
And I watch very talented people
who do this every fucking week


947
00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:47.452
sit around, talk to each other,

948
00:40:47.535 --> 00:40:48.785
how they're gonna plan
this shit.


949
00:40:48.868 --> 00:40:49.660
"How are we gonna make her fly?
How are we gonna do this shit


950
00:40:49.743 --> 00:40:51.619
and whatnot?"
And then periodically,


951
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:53.701
they remember I'm there and they
look over at me and they go,


952
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:57.369
"What do you think, Kev?"

953
00:40:57.452 --> 00:41:00.243
I'm like, "I think
that sounds awesome!" You know.


954
00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:03.077
And they're like,
"Okay, big guy." You know.


955
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.035
And they go back to making
the fucking show


956
00:41:05.118 --> 00:41:06.619
and stuff like that.
So it's been nice,


957
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:08.410
it's been a nice thing
to do, to go up there.


958
00:41:08.494 --> 00:41:11.243
As a fan of the show,
I get to watch stuff get done.


959
00:41:11.327 --> 00:41:12.993
And so, it first started
happening I think


960
00:41:13.077 --> 00:41:14.243
when I was doing Supergirl.

961
00:41:14.327 --> 00:41:17.701
Um, we were-- we were doing
some-- setting up


962
00:41:17.785 --> 00:41:20.035
some fucking big sequence
at this pool.


963
00:41:20.118 --> 00:41:22.494
Uh, the giant, like,
a community pool.


964
00:41:22.577 --> 00:41:24.243
And it was a big wide shot
and whatnot.


965
00:41:24.327 --> 00:41:25.868
We're doing it like
when the pool is closed


966
00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:27.619
so it's like two in the morning.
It's real late.


967
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:30.035
So, you know, people are run
down, we've had our "lunch."


968
00:41:30.118 --> 00:41:31.452
Which was at midnight
or whatever.


969
00:41:31.535 --> 00:41:33.077
But people are getting tired
because it's late


970
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.993
and it's cold.
So, you know, I was like,


971
00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:37.369
"Fuck man. I'm gonna get--
I'm gonna go get some


972
00:41:37.452 --> 00:41:39.202
burgers for my crew."

973
00:41:39.285 --> 00:41:41.452
For the people on camera
and stuff like that.


974
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:43.701
'Cause they're the ones that
gotta be up and sharp.


975
00:41:43.785 --> 00:41:46.202
So I was talking
to the first AD,


976
00:41:46.285 --> 00:41:47.118
he was like new on the show,

977
00:41:47.202 --> 00:41:48.577
first time I'd ever
met him and stuff.


978
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.743
And I was like, "Hey, man.
I was thinking about--


979
00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:52.410
how long do you think
this is gonna take?"


980
00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:54.243
He's like, "I think we're gonna
be ready to go in five minutes."


981
00:41:54.327 --> 00:41:57.743
"Hey, I'm gonna go grab some
fucking burgers, man.


982
00:41:57.826 --> 00:41:59.243
Can you watch this?"

983
00:41:59.327 --> 00:42:01.619
And he goes, "What do you mean,
watch this?"


984
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:03.327
I was like, "Well,
if you guys are ready,


985
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.243
just start shooting
without me." He goes,


986
00:42:04.327 --> 00:42:05.951
"What an interesting way
to direct a show


987
00:42:06.035 --> 00:42:08.369
by not being there at all."

988
00:42:08.452 --> 00:42:10.993
I was like, "I know,
but you guys do this shit


989
00:42:11.077 --> 00:42:12.535
every week without me.
Let's be real.


990
00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:14.035
And it's a big wide shot,
performance--


991
00:42:14.118 --> 00:42:15.452
we're just doing it
for the wide.


992
00:42:15.535 --> 00:42:17.660
It's the performance--
I'll be back for that and shit.


993
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:19.160
You got this, right?" He's like,
"Sure, man. Go ahead."


994
00:42:19.243 --> 00:42:21.743
And so I fucking got
in the car


995
00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:24.118
and I left set and I drove down
the road to--


996
00:42:24.202 --> 00:42:27.202
In Canada,
they got an A&W place.


997
00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:28.369
They do A&W burgers
and root beer and shit.


998
00:42:28.452 --> 00:42:30.993
And it's-- they're amazing.
It's my favorite burger


999
00:42:31.077 --> 00:42:33.035
on the fucking planet.

1000
00:42:33.118 --> 00:42:34.035
So they're open 24 hours.

1001
00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.077
And they're like literally
across the street


1002
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.118
from where we were shooting.

1003
00:42:37.202 --> 00:42:39.619
So I rolled up on A&W
at two in the morning.


1004
00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:40.577
And I pull up to the box
and shit.


1005
00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.619
And they're like,
"A&W, can I help you?"


1006
00:42:42.701 --> 00:42:45.202
It's one guy. And I said,
"Uh, hi.


1007
00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:49.243
Let me get 20 Buddy Burgers,
man."


1008
00:42:49.327 --> 00:42:52.243
And the guy goes, "Yeah, right."

1009
00:42:53.369 --> 00:42:55.785
I was like, "No, I'm serious.

1010
00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:57.951
And he goes, "Pull up to the
window so I can confirm


1011
00:42:58.035 --> 00:43:01.619
your method of payment."

1012
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:02.868
I said, "Okay, fair enough."

1013
00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:04.535
And I went up to fucking
next window and shit like that.


1014
00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:05.660
And he opened his window,
I rolled mine down,


1015
00:43:05.743 --> 00:43:10.202
and he goes, "Oh, it's you.
Well, that makes sense."


1016
00:43:15.118 --> 00:43:16.868
I was like, "What the fuck's
that mean, man?"


1017
00:43:16.951 --> 00:43:18.118
He's like, "That's a lot
of burgers.


1018
00:43:18.202 --> 00:43:19.701
And I heard you were in town."
I was like,


1019
00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:22.160
"I-- they're not for me."

1020
00:43:22.243 --> 00:43:23.701
He was like, "I don't need
to ask any questions."


1021
00:43:23.785 --> 00:43:25.118
I was like, "I'm getting them
for the people on Supergirl."


1022
00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:28.701
He's like, "I'm sure you are."

1023
00:43:28.785 --> 00:43:31.327
I go, "20 burgers, man. How long
is that supposed to take?


1024
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.785
'Cause I'm supposed to be back
in five minutes."


1025
00:43:32.868 --> 00:43:35.369
He goes, "20 burgers usually
take about 20 minutes.


1026
00:43:35.452 --> 00:43:38.243
But like if you will take
a selfie with me,


1027
00:43:38.327 --> 00:43:40.202
I'll do it in ten."
I was like,


1028
00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:42.619
"If you'll do it in ten,
I'll fucking blow you, man."


1029
00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:45.951
And he goes, "The selfie
will be fine, Mr. Smith."


1030
00:43:46.035 --> 00:43:47.202
So I said, "Fantastic."
So I waited by the side,


1031
00:43:47.285 --> 00:43:49.535
he cooked up fucking 20 burgers
and shit.


1032
00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:51.701
Came out with two big bags,
gave them to me.


1033
00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:54.035
He's like, "Thanks."
We took a selfie and shit.


1034
00:43:54.118 --> 00:43:56.619
Off I went, back to the place.
I was like, "Yay, burgers!"


1035
00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:58.077
And I started giving out burgers
and shit.


1036
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.826
And soon the burgers
were fucking gone.


1037
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.494
And I was like, "Oh, fuck.
I didn't get enough."


1038
00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:03.243
I said, "If I do this again,
I gotta get more."


1039
00:44:03.327 --> 00:44:04.910
Some crew members were like,
"Where's the burgers?"


1040
00:44:04.993 --> 00:44:06.035
I was like,
"Oh, they ate them all."


1041
00:44:06.118 --> 00:44:08.410
They're like, "Fucking A."
And walked away.


1042
00:44:08.494 --> 00:44:10.993
So I was like, "Fuck man.
Let me see if I can fucking


1043
00:44:11.077 --> 00:44:12.285
get some burgers going
and shit like that tomorrow."


1044
00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:15.410
So next day,
we were shooting late again.


1045
00:44:15.494 --> 00:44:17.202
Like it was one in the morning
and stuff.


1046
00:44:17.285 --> 00:44:20.243
And so, you know,
I was bored again on set


1047
00:44:20.327 --> 00:44:22.077
at a certain point,
everybody's working.


1048
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.369
I don't really have anything
to do.


1049
00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:25.868
So I was like, maybe I'll go get
'em some fucking burgers, man.


1050
00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:27.535
I'll roll up on
the burger joint again.


1051
00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:28.868
It's right across the street.

1052
00:44:28.951 --> 00:44:31.910
So I pull up and I hear, uh,
"Welcome to A&W.


1053
00:44:31.993 --> 00:44:33.951
Can I help you?"
I said, "Hey.


1054
00:44:34.035 --> 00:44:35.619
Let me get 40 Buddy Burgers."

1055
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:38.118
And the guy, it's not the guy
from the other night. He goes,


1056
00:44:38.202 --> 00:44:40.577
"What, are you high?"

1057
00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.619
"No, no, no." I was like,
"I-- no. I do want this."


1058
00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:46.494
And he goes, "Please drive up
to the next window


1059
00:44:46.577 --> 00:44:48.660
to confirm your method
of payment." You know.


1060
00:44:48.743 --> 00:44:51.452
So I drive up to the window,
he opens his up and mine,


1061
00:44:51.535 --> 00:44:55.285
he goes, "Oh, I heard about you.
I get it now."


1062
00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:56.619
I said, "What do you mean?"
He's going,


1063
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:59.118
"You were here last night."
I said, "That's right.


1064
00:44:59.202 --> 00:45:00.160
I ordered 20 burgers."
He's like, "Yeah.


1065
00:45:00.243 --> 00:45:02.619
The guy last night,
he's a big fan and stuff.


1066
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:04.410
He's been showing everybody
the picture."


1067
00:45:04.494 --> 00:45:06.327
I was like, "Right on." I said,
"Well, I'm back for more."


1068
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.118
He goes, "What do you want?"
I said, "Can I get


1069
00:45:08.202 --> 00:45:10.452
40 Buddy Burgers, man?"
He goes, "Okay.


1070
00:45:10.535 --> 00:45:11.993
Give me your credit card."
I showed him. He's like,


1071
00:45:12.077 --> 00:45:13.743
"All right." I said,
"How long is that gonna take?"


1072
00:45:13.826 --> 00:45:15.285
He's like, "40 burgers,

1073
00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:16.951
I was like, "Oh, well,
the guy yesterday, man,


1074
00:45:17.035 --> 00:45:18.285
he said 20 burgers
takes 20 minutes.


1075
00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:19.785
But he did it in ten and shit."

1076
00:45:19.868 --> 00:45:22.619
And he goes, "That's 'cause
the other guy's a big fan."


1077
00:45:28.785 --> 00:45:30.535
Understood, captain. You know...

1078
00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:33.410
So I went and waited.

1079
00:45:33.494 --> 00:45:34.826
they brought out my fucking
Buddy Burgers.


1080
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.868
Big bags and shit like that.
I said thank you.


1081
00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:39.285
I went back to work and shit.
I was like, "Hey!


1082
00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:40.452
Fucking burgers for everybody!"

1083
00:45:40.535 --> 00:45:42.660
Everyone's like happy
to get them. It's crazy, man.


1084
00:45:42.743 --> 00:45:44.619
It's really sweet.
Like, it's...


1085
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.243
I don't know why,
they're like, "Oh, my God.


1086
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:47.701
This is nice." And I'm like,
"It's $1.99 burger."


1087
00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:51.369
I tell them all. I'm like, look,
man, I'm gonna go home


1088
00:45:51.452 --> 00:45:53.285
and they're gonna give me
so much fucking credit


1089
00:45:53.369 --> 00:45:55.701
for directing this episode.
We all know I didn't do shit.


1090
00:45:55.785 --> 00:45:58.660
The least thing I could do
is buy you a fucking burger.


1091
00:45:58.743 --> 00:46:02.535
And McCloud, the AD,
is like, "Fucking A." You know.


1092
00:46:04.077 --> 00:46:06.494
So it was great. Like people,
it really cheers people up


1093
00:46:06.577 --> 00:46:08.160
and shit like that. It's perfect
walking around food.


1094
00:46:08.243 --> 00:46:09.160
When you're done,
you just throw the paper out


1095
00:46:09.243 --> 00:46:11.327
and shit like that.
But I ran out of burgers,


1096
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.826
40 wasn't enough. There
was still some people


1097
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:13.993
that didn't get any.
I was like, "Fuck!


1098
00:46:14.077 --> 00:46:16.160
Next time I gotta go
fucking higher and shit."


1099
00:46:16.243 --> 00:46:18.577
So we had one more night
of night shoots and shit.


1100
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.701
So it's about two in the morning
and at one point,


1101
00:46:20.785 --> 00:46:22.619
I rolled up to McCloud,
the AD, and I was like,


1102
00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:23.826
"Hey, McCloud." He goes,
"Go ahead.


1103
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.619
Just get me three burgers."
You know.


1104
00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:28.785
I was like, "Will do, man."
So I got in the car,


1105
00:46:28.868 --> 00:46:31.202
and I went back
to fucking A&W and shit.


1106
00:46:31.285 --> 00:46:32.868
And I pull up to the box
and I was like,


1107
00:46:32.951 --> 00:46:36.826
"Hi, man. I'm-- let me get

1108
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.951
And the guy goes,
"Right away, Mr. Smith."


1109
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.577
I'd built something of a
reputation of sorts and stuff.


1110
00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.868
So, you know, I was like,
"Oh, fuck. This is great."


1111
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:55.077
I said, "You know what?
I'm gonna go deeper tonight."


1112
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.743
I said, "70 Mama Burgers.

1113
00:46:56.826 --> 00:46:59.327
Let me get like 40 French fries
as well."


1114
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.243
And he goes, "Okay."
I said, "20 onion rings."


1115
00:47:01.327 --> 00:47:04.369
He goes, "Right on." And I'm
looking at the menu board,


1116
00:47:04.452 --> 00:47:06.660
like I've been going to A&W
three nights in a row.


1117
00:47:06.743 --> 00:47:07.743
And since I stay away
from sugar,


1118
00:47:07.826 --> 00:47:11.868
I've been trying not
to succumb to the temptation


1119
00:47:11.951 --> 00:47:13.619
because like I love root beer.

1120
00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:14.826
It's one of my favorite things
in the world.


1121
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.743
I love sugar.
I love sugar on anything.


1122
00:47:16.826 --> 00:47:19.701
You put it on dog shit,
I'm like this is the best.


1123
00:47:19.785 --> 00:47:21.410
But root beer is one
of my favorites.


1124
00:47:21.494 --> 00:47:23.535
And they market it so well.
Like the orange and brown


1125
00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:26.494
just like makes you salivate
and shit,


1126
00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.243
like a Pavlovian response.

1127
00:47:28.327 --> 00:47:30.118
And all these days and nights
I've been able


1128
00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:31.243
to not fucking get
a root beer.


1129
00:47:31.327 --> 00:47:34.410
But I'm like, it's fucking
two in the morning, man.


1130
00:47:34.494 --> 00:47:36.369
And like you're buying everyone
these burgers.


1131
00:47:36.452 --> 00:47:37.701
And like it's
like your mom said:


1132
00:47:37.785 --> 00:47:40.743
you're a good boy.
You know? Like...


1133
00:47:40.826 --> 00:47:43.035
You fucking--
you deserve a treat, man.


1134
00:47:43.118 --> 00:47:45.452
Why don't you get yourself
a fucking root beer, champ.


1135
00:47:45.535 --> 00:47:47.868
You know. And I was like,
"Let me add to that, man.


1136
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:51.910
I wanna add one small
diet root beer."


1137
00:47:51.993 --> 00:47:54.910
And he starts laughing,
the guy in the ordering box.


1138
00:47:54.993 --> 00:47:56.619
I said, "What's the matter?"
He goes, "Look at the screen."


1139
00:47:56.701 --> 00:48:00.160
And I looked at the screen,
it said 70 Mama Burgers,


1140
00:48:00.243 --> 00:48:01.369
40 French fries,

1141
00:48:01.452 --> 00:48:05.826
one small diet root beer."

1142
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.660
He goes, "That looks like the
worst diet ever attempted."


1143
00:48:11.743 --> 00:48:16.202
He goes, "I'm totally
Instagramming that."


1144
00:48:16.285 --> 00:48:17.577
So I pull up to the fucking
window and shit,


1145
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.868
give him my credit card,
it's my friend


1146
00:48:18.951 --> 00:48:21.535
from the first night and shit,
the guy I took pictures with.


1147
00:48:21.619 --> 00:48:22.619
I was like,
"Hey, man. It's you."


1148
00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:24.619
He's like, "Mr. Smith,
I gotta tell you."


1149
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.535
I said, "Look, first off,
Mr. Smith is my father.


1150
00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:27.619
Just call me Kevin."
He goes, "Kevin,


1151
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.494
I gotta tell you,
I've been telling my manager


1152
00:48:29.577 --> 00:48:30.826
that you've been
coming every night


1153
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.369
and that you've been buying
these burgers.


1154
00:48:32.452 --> 00:48:34.619
And my manager asked me
to ask you


1155
00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:36.951
if you wanna give us one
of your jerseys,


1156
00:48:37.035 --> 00:48:39.660
we'll hang it up here
in the A&W."


1157
00:48:39.743 --> 00:48:42.993
And I was like, "Are you telling
me you wanna raise my


1158
00:48:43.077 --> 00:48:46.202
fucking jersey to the rafters

1159
00:48:46.285 --> 00:48:48.494
of an A&W Root Beer?"

1160
00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:55.452
I was like,
"That's the highest honor


1161
00:48:55.535 --> 00:48:59.327
a non
-Canadian can receive."

1162
00:49:00.743 --> 00:49:04.160
So, um, so I found my place,
like that's what I do.


1163
00:49:04.243 --> 00:49:06.202
I bring shit.
I bring food for people,


1164
00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:07.285
I bring toys for the actors.

1165
00:49:07.369 --> 00:49:09.452
That's how I do the actors
and shit like that.


1166
00:49:09.535 --> 00:49:12.118
I learned that when I was
on Supergirl  at one point.


1167
00:49:12.202 --> 00:49:13.743
I had like a break,
lunch break,


1168
00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:16.160
and rather than sit around
and eat lunch,


1169
00:49:16.243 --> 00:49:18.701
like I smoked lunch.
And then we were near


1170
00:49:18.785 --> 00:49:21.868
a Toys 'R' Us, so I went stoner
shopping and stuff like that.


1171
00:49:21.951 --> 00:49:24.410
And, you know, I had a basket
so I kept throwing in shit.


1172
00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:25.619
Everything under five bucks,

1173
00:49:25.701 --> 00:49:27.369
little trinkets
and shit like that.


1174
00:49:27.452 --> 00:49:29.868
And so I bought like a book
of stickers,


1175
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:31.327
puffy animal stickers.

1176
00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:33.785
We went back to shoot a scene
with Chyler,


1177
00:49:33.868 --> 00:49:35.826
who plays Supergirl's sister,
Alex,


1178
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.993
and with Melissa,
who plays Supergirl.


1179
00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:40.035
And so we were about
to rehearse,


1180
00:49:40.118 --> 00:49:42.785
do a blocking rehearsal, and I
had one of the puffy stickers,


1181
00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:43.993
I had it on my finger and I
walked up to the two ladies


1182
00:49:44.077 --> 00:49:48.285
and I was like, "Ladies,
you see this puffy dog sticker?


1183
00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:52.452
Whoever wins this scene
wins the sticker."


1184
00:49:54.118 --> 00:49:57.035
It was adorable. Chyler goes,
"You're going down, bitch."


1185
00:49:57.118 --> 00:49:58.743
You know, fucking...

1186
00:50:00.452 --> 00:50:01.619
And they did, they fucking
out-acted each other,


1187
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:05.619
like wizards fighting
and shit like that.


1188
00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:07.410
All for the puffy sticker.
And at the end,


1189
00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:09.785
I was like you both
get a puffy sticker.


1190
00:50:09.868 --> 00:50:12.118
And Chyler was like,
"That wasn't the rule."


1191
00:50:12.202 --> 00:50:13.910
You know.

1192
00:50:13.993 --> 00:50:16.494
But how I direct is I bring
food for everybody


1193
00:50:16.577 --> 00:50:17.577
and give them toys and shit.

1194
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.868
I'm more of like a craft service
person, you know.


1195
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:24.619
Or a candy man
than anything else.


1196
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:27.202
Um, I love doing
this sort of thing.


1197
00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:28.743
And there's always people
that will come up to me


1198
00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:32.202
after the show,
say very nice things.


1199
00:50:32.285 --> 00:50:34.868
Uh, very cool things about
like, "Oh, my God.


1200
00:50:34.951 --> 00:50:37.243
It's so... you're so talented."

1201
00:50:37.327 --> 00:50:39.077
That's the one that
really fucking bugs me


1202
00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.243
and shit like that. Me-- and not
because I'm irritated by it.


1203
00:50:42.327 --> 00:50:44.743
But when you say shit
like "talent,"


1204
00:50:44.826 --> 00:50:47.077
it makes people go like,
"Oh, you're special


1205
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160
and this person's not."
I don't agree with that.


1206
00:50:48.243 --> 00:50:51.619
I don't really do anything
that requires talent.


1207
00:50:51.701 --> 00:50:53.077
I just kind of chase my dreams.

1208
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.619
Anything I wanna try,
I give a shot to and stuff.


1209
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:57.535
Before I get out of the show,
I always like to remind people,


1210
00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:59.868
like, you can do that too.

1211
00:50:59.951 --> 00:51:00.785
Like, at the end of the day,

1212
00:51:00.868 --> 00:51:02.701
this doesn't require
fucking talent.


1213
00:51:02.785 --> 00:51:04.202
Invariably,
somebody will say to me,


1214
00:51:04.285 --> 00:51:05.202
before the night is over,
"Oh, my God.


1215
00:51:05.285 --> 00:51:07.452
It's so talented how
you can stand up there


1216
00:51:07.535 --> 00:51:08.285
and talk for so long."
And I'm like,


1217
00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:10.951
"That doesn't take talent
to talk


1218
00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:13.826
and tell stories about my life.
That just takes a memory.


1219
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.077
Like that's... that's it.
That doesn't require talent."


1220
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.826
My day job doesn't even
take talent.


1221
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.701
You think it takes talent
to stand on a movie set


1222
00:51:20.785 --> 00:51:23.118
and wear a backwards
baseball cap


1223
00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:26.243
and a trench coat
and say nothing?


1224
00:51:26.327 --> 00:51:29.160
That's the exact opposite
of fucking talent, man.


1225
00:51:29.243 --> 00:51:30.868
I said I'll take it
one step further.


1226
00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:33.160
It doesn't take talent at all
to work in the movie business.


1227
00:51:33.243 --> 00:51:35.285
You think it takes fucking
talent to stand on a movie set


1228
00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:36.826
and be like, "I'm Batman."
Ben Affleck does it,


1229
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:40.619
so I know it don't take
fucking talent.


1230
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:51.410
Don't let people use
like a word like that


1231
00:51:51.494 --> 00:51:53.910
to put shit between you
and something you wanna try.


1232
00:51:53.993 --> 00:51:56.577
This doesn't take talent.
It doesn't take talent


1233
00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.660
to talk about your fucking life.
Over the course of your life,


1234
00:51:59.743 --> 00:52:01.285
you've listened to people talk
on the radio,


1235
00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:04.410
or seen people talk on TV,
and you've said to yourself


1236
00:52:04.494 --> 00:52:07.993
or thought to yourself,
"I'm smarter than these people.


1237
00:52:08.077 --> 00:52:10.577
I'm funnier than this person."
You're probably thinking that


1238
00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.035
shit right now.

1239
00:52:12.118 --> 00:52:15.035
And you're probably right, man,
but nobody's gonna know


1240
00:52:15.118 --> 00:52:17.077
unless you kinda go out there
and express yourself


1241
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.660
in some way, shape or form.
Share of yourself.


1242
00:52:19.743 --> 00:52:21.535
Now, some people don't want to
'cause they're afraid


1243
00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:23.202
that it might not work
and shit like that.


1244
00:52:23.285 --> 00:52:26.077
Like, "Oh, what if I fail?"
But there is no such thing


1245
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.243
as fucking failure. Failure
is just success training.


1246
00:52:29.327 --> 00:52:30.993
I know that sounds like a cat
poster, but it's fucking true.


1247
00:52:31.077 --> 00:52:34.910
Like, nobody ever fucking
gets something right


1248
00:52:34.993 --> 00:52:36.660
on the first try and shit.

1249
00:52:36.743 --> 00:52:37.868
Don't be afraid of failure.

1250
00:52:37.951 --> 00:52:40.285
Don't let that
keep you from trying something


1251
00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:42.035
that you might wanna try
and stuff like that.


1252
00:52:42.118 --> 00:52:44.035
Rather fail spectacularly
than live your life wondering,


1253
00:52:44.118 --> 00:52:45.993
like, "I wonder if that shit
would have worked out."


1254
00:52:46.077 --> 00:52:49.327
That's how I've just
kind of conducted myself


1255
00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:50.993
for the last like 20, 25 years.

1256
00:52:51.077 --> 00:52:53.035
And it's led on this weird
fucking journey.


1257
00:52:53.118 --> 00:52:54.993
So the cats who come out
and support me


1258
00:52:55.077 --> 00:52:56.035
and see the shows and stuff,
I always wanna try


1259
00:52:56.118 --> 00:52:58.660
to give something back
at the end of the day.


1260
00:52:58.743 --> 00:53:00.619
Like you've given me so much.
You've given me a way


1261
00:53:00.701 --> 00:53:02.577
to not have to fucking work
for a living.


1262
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.910
So like, you know,
I always wanna try to give back.


1263
00:53:04.993 --> 00:53:08.160
I could give the money back,
but fuck that. So like...


1264
00:53:08.243 --> 00:53:10.410
the least I could give back
is I know there are people


1265
00:53:10.494 --> 00:53:12.160
in the audience that are like,
"I kinda wanna do what you do."


1266
00:53:12.243 --> 00:53:16.118
And you absolutely fucking can.
I'm gonna tell you something


1267
00:53:16.202 --> 00:53:19.118
that maybe like you don't hear
that much anymore,


1268
00:53:19.202 --> 00:53:20.785
'cause you're adults and shit,
and it's our job


1269
00:53:20.868 --> 00:53:22.743
to say this to younger people
and shit.


1270
00:53:22.826 --> 00:53:24.993
But this is the truest sentiment
a stranger's gonna fucking


1271
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:26.160
tell you this week,
so fucking get ready.


1272
00:53:26.243 --> 00:53:29.910
You are smart and good.
You're all fucking talented.


1273
00:53:29.993 --> 00:53:32.577
You all have something amazing
to fucking say.


1274
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:35.619
-So...

1275
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:37.369
find a way...

1276
00:53:37.452 --> 00:53:39.243
Find a way
to fucking share that.


1277
00:53:39.327 --> 00:53:42.077
I-- I've, like,
I'm 47 years old.


1278
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.993
And I'm still trying to figure
out who the fuck I am.


1279
00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:48.369
So before you leave this world,
figure out who you are


1280
00:53:48.452 --> 00:53:49.535
at your core, man.

1281
00:53:49.619 --> 00:53:52.410
I have, as I mentioned
at the beginning of the show,


1282
00:53:52.494 --> 00:53:55.035
a kid, like so I guess
at my core, ultimately,


1283
00:53:55.118 --> 00:53:57.327
I'm a fucking dad.
So I do dad-type things


1284
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.619
and I wanna share this fucking
last thing with you.


1285
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:03.035
Uh, my kid and I text.
This is a text exchange


1286
00:54:03.118 --> 00:54:04.910
we had about her boyfriend,
Cory.


1287
00:54:04.993 --> 00:54:07.202
She's got this
boyfriend, Cory, man.


1288
00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:08.202
He's a great fucking kid.

1289
00:54:08.285 --> 00:54:09.993
I know you're supposed to be
like, "Hey, man.


1290
00:54:10.077 --> 00:54:11.118
He's dating my daughter
and that makes me mad."


1291
00:54:11.202 --> 00:54:13.619
Not at all. They've been dating
for five years,


1292
00:54:13.701 --> 00:54:15.285
they met like freshman year,
and when they were dating


1293
00:54:15.369 --> 00:54:18.160
for four days, man, I watched
and met the dude and shit,


1294
00:54:18.243 --> 00:54:21.577
and I told my daughter,
"Marry this boy tomorrow."


1295
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.743
You know. And my wife is like,
"You fucking stoned?


1296
00:54:23.826 --> 00:54:25.619
They're 14." I was like, "It
worked for Coalminer's Daughter.


1297
00:54:25.701 --> 00:54:29.327
Let them get married!"

1298
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:30.494
So I him,
I'm a Cory booster, man.


1299
00:54:30.577 --> 00:54:32.619
I'm always like, "You'll never
find a guy like this.


1300
00:54:32.701 --> 00:54:33.868
He literally gives a shit
about everything you say.


1301
00:54:33.951 --> 00:54:35.202
He's always hanging
on your every word.


1302
00:54:35.285 --> 00:54:38.951
He's like Lloyd Dobler
in Say Anything  and shit.


1303
00:54:39.035 --> 00:54:42.494
Not every guy is like this.
Most guys are like Uncle Jay.


1304
00:54:42.577 --> 00:54:44.494
So like...

1305
00:54:44.577 --> 00:54:46.077
I said stick with this
fucking guy.


1306
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.202
So she did all through
high school and stuff.


1307
00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:51.243
And senior year, like I said,
she just graduated,


1308
00:54:51.327 --> 00:54:53.743
she got to go to two proms,
her prom at her school


1309
00:54:53.826 --> 00:54:55.410
and Cory went
to a different school.


1310
00:54:55.494 --> 00:54:58.327
So they went to her prom first,
then they went to Cory's prom.


1311
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.327
And I was out on the road
doing a gig.


1312
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.993
And this is the fucking text
I got from my kid


1313
00:55:03.077 --> 00:55:05.369
on prom night. She goes,
"Dad! SOS."


1314
00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:08.743
I'm freaked out 'cause I'm
someplace else in the country.


1315
00:55:08.826 --> 00:55:10.535
And I'm like, "Oh, my God!
Are you okay?"


1316
00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:13.202
And she goes, "No!
Cory's bowtie broke.


1317
00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:16.951
Where do you keep
your spare bowties?"


1318
00:55:24.077 --> 00:55:29.285
I said, "Kiddo, I don't have
a bowtie, let alone spares."


1319
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:31.535
And she wrote, she has
the temerity to write,


1320
00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:32.743
"Seriously?"

1321
00:55:32.826 --> 00:55:37.077
And I'm like, "I wear the same
fucking outfit every day."


1322
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.577
I said, "You ever see me wear
a bowtie with a hockey jersey?"


1323
00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.785
And she goes, "What about
when you got married?"


1324
00:55:42.868 --> 00:55:44.452
And I said,
"I was wearing a hoodie


1325
00:55:44.535 --> 00:55:47.410
and a Jay and Silent Bob
shirt."


1326
00:55:47.494 --> 00:55:50.826
And she goes, "Ew! You're so
fucking lucky Mom married you."


1327
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:53.951
And I said... I said, "Why?

1328
00:55:54.035 --> 00:55:55.535
Because I wasn't wearing
a bowtie?" And she goes,


1329
00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:57.743
"No, because you wore
a Jay and Silent Bob  shirt


1330
00:55:57.826 --> 00:55:59.118
to your own wedding."

1331
00:55:59.202 --> 00:56:06.035
And she wrote, "Duh! Look at me!
I'm Silent Bob!"


1332
00:56:06.118 --> 00:56:09.160
Ladies and gentlemen, you have
a good time this evening?


1333
00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:16.202
I cannot thank you enough
for coming out, man!


1334
00:56:16.285 --> 00:56:17.035
Thanks for listening
to me bullshit!


1335
00:56:17.118 --> 00:56:18.369
Make sure you go out
and bullshit


1336
00:56:18.452 --> 00:56:22.035
before you leave this world!
I love you all, good night!


1337
00:56:49.369 --> 00:56:54.077
This is the room where I almost
died. Look at this.


1338
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.910
Could you imagine if this
was your death room?


1339
00:56:55.993 --> 00:56:58.035
The last thing you saw was this?

1340
00:56:58.118 --> 00:57:00.785
I could not get comfortable
to save my life.


1341
00:57:00.868 --> 00:57:02.577
That's 'cause I was dying.

1342
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.369
Kids, when you're dying,
very tough to get comfortable.


1343
00:57:05.452 --> 00:57:07.494
Basically, three hours prior
to this moment,


1344
00:57:07.577 --> 00:57:10.535
I'd smoked a joint,
so I was calm.


1345
00:57:10.619 --> 00:57:12.535
I never got scared and stuff.

1346
00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:14.160
They told me later on,
the doctor was like,


1347
00:57:14.243 --> 00:57:15.826
"You were so calm."
And I said,


1348
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.910
"I was blazed, man.
I smoked."


1349
00:57:16.993 --> 00:57:18.160
He goes, "That saved your life."

1350
00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:20.327
I said, "Smoking weed
saved my life?


1351
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.577
Can you-- I'm gonna put that
on a fucking shirt


1352
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.118
and on a bumper sticker
and stuff like that."
