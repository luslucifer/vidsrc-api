"so-called
because its only known occurrence


19
00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:06.458
"is among the descendants
of one Ebenezer Merrye.


20
00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:10.003
"A progressive age regression
beginning about the tenth year


21
00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.549
"and continuing steadily
throughout the victim's lifetime.


22
00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:17.261
"It is believed that eventually
the victim of the Merrye syndrome


23
00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:21.640
"may even regress
beyond the prenatal level,

25
00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:32.776
"Many authorities do not accept
the existence of Merrye syndrome."


26
00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:35.696
Incredible.

27
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:38.574
But true.

28
00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.412
Nevertheless, I know only too well.

29
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.583
Of course,
there's no Merrye syndrome any more.


30
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.129
It was extinguished for ever

31
00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:54.423
from the human race

32
00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:58.635
that fateful day ten years ago.

33
00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.382
Can you tell me
where the Merrye house is?


34
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:39.468
I said the Merrye house!

35
00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.809
If there is any such place,
we don't know anything about it!


36
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.145
Good. Get in.

37
00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.458
Anybody home?

38
00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.379
Anybody home?

39
00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.299
Please say yes, somebody's home.

40
00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:25.736
Hello in there!

41
00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:38.457
Hello?

42
00:07:43.628 --> 00:07:44.880
Hello?

43
00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:49.009
I caught you!

44
00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:54.973
I caught you.
I've caught a big fat bug


45
00:07:55.098 --> 00:07:57.392
right in my spider web.

46
00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:05.650
And now the spider
gets to give the bug a big sting.


47
00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:09.780
Sting, sting...

48
00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:11.782
...sting, sting!

49
00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:14.242
Sting, sting, sting, sting!

50
00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:18.163
Sting!

51
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.752
Virginia!

52
00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:28.298
Virginia, are you crazy?
Now look what you've done.


53
00:08:29.007 --> 00:08:31.843
You're bad. Bad!

54
00:08:31.968 --> 00:08:34.346
Bruno's going to hate you!

55
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.904
Elizabeth? Virginia?

56
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.872
Elizabeth?

57
00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:25.582
Virginia?

58
00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:28.251
Elizabeth?

59
00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:33.048
One, two, three...

60
00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:38.303
Elizabeth!

61
00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:43.475
Bruno, Virginia hurt somebody real bad.

62
00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:45.977
You ought to hate her.

63
00:10:46.102 --> 00:10:50.857
Elizabeth, how many times
have I told you it's not nice to hate?


64
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.530
Oh.

65
00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:00.742
Oh!

66
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.827
Dum, dum...

67
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.462
The one time I leave them alone.

68
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.757
And now this.

69
00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:22.430
Elizabeth, I trusted you.
I left you in charge.


70
00:11:22.555 --> 00:11:25.308
It's not my fault! 
I didn't do it!

71
00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:28.687
She did it.
She was playing spider.


72
00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:30.897
- You should hate her.
- No!


73
00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:32.691
I left you in charge!

74
00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:37.570
Virginia!
Virginia, you come here right now!


75
00:11:40.073 --> 00:11:43.076
Ralph! Ralph, Ralph, Ralph!

76
00:11:46.204 --> 00:11:49.249
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! R
-R
-R
-Ralph!

77
00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.502
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
R-R-R-Ralph! Ralph!


78
00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:57.674
Ralph, we're home now.

79
00:11:58.425 --> 00:11:59.843
Ralph!

80
00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:03.888
- Ralph, we're home now.
- Ralph! Ralph.


81
00:12:15.859 --> 00:12:17.402
Ralph!

82
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.640
Virginia, now you stay right there.

83
00:12:48.349 --> 00:12:51.436
You come and sit down. Sit down.

84
00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:53.646
You too, Elizabeth.

85
00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:03.073
Now, children,
I wanna tell you something


86
00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:06.785
and I want you to listen
very, very carefully.


87
00:13:08.453 --> 00:13:11.539
You remember last time
when those two children


88
00:13:11.664 --> 00:13:13.500
climbed over the wall

89
00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:17.087
and Virginia almost caught them
in her spider web?


90
00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:18.546
Mm-hm.

91
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:23.635
Well, that got people wondering
about us and that's bad.


92
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.054
Your daddy wouldn't like that,
Virginia.


93
00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:30.433
Now, I can't be here all the time.

94
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:34.771
You know that I have to take Ralph
into the city to the doctor


95
00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:36.689
once in a while.

96
00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:40.110
And Virginia, you were supposed
to mind your sister.


97
00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:43.530
You were not supposed
to play spider any more.


98
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:47.534
Now you never, never
can play spider again!


99
00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:52.622
Oh, Ralph,
what have you got there?


100
00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:54.207
Something that man had.

101
00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:56.126
Ralph, give it to me.

102
00:13:57.043 --> 00:13:59.754
That's it. Thank you, Ralph.

103
00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:04.801
Huh.

104
00:14:05.426 --> 00:14:07.846
This is from a lawyer.

105
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.600
Yeah, a lawyer.

106
00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:14.602
What is this, Bruno?

107
00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:16.688
Something bad, isn't it?

108
00:14:17.397 --> 00:14:19.315
How many times do
I have to tell you

109
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.694
just because something isn't good
doesn't mean it's bad?


110
00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:24.654
I knew that!

111
00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:27.365
It must be something VERY bad!

112
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:31.369
Nothing is VERY bad.

113
00:14:31.494 --> 00:14:32.829
It isn't?

114
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.707
Huh.

115
00:14:36.332 --> 00:14:39.377
He's going to come here
and bring other people.


116
00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:43.339
Daddy wouldn't like that.

117
00:14:43.464 --> 00:14:45.091
What other people?

118
00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:49.387
They want to... make...

119
00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:52.891
They want
to become your legal guardians.


120
00:14:54.642 --> 00:14:59.814
"As the only other known surviving heirs

121
00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:04.360
"of the estate of Titus W. Merrye..."

122
00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:06.821
- Isn't that Daddy?
- Yeah. Uh...


123
00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:10.783
"On the 14th of..."

124
00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:16.956
Today's the 14th.

125
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.421
Now, children, we've gotta keep
some secrets today.


126
00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:43.483
Huh?

127
00:17:02.353 --> 00:17:05.189
Urgh. What do you want that for?

128
00:17:06.357 --> 00:17:08.443
Hurry up!
I wanna watch Uncle Ned.


129
00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:10.737
You're not supposed to!

130
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.743
- Hey!
- Look out!


131
00:17:18.953 --> 00:17:20.872
I'm coming, Uncle Ned.

132
00:17:48.649 --> 00:17:52.904
I'm coming,
Aunt Clara, Aunt Martha.


133
00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:55.823
I'm coming, Uncle Ned.

134
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.049
Emily!
I mean, I wish you'd kind of...


135
00:18:13.174 --> 00:18:17.095
Peter, if you don't like my driving,
you may feel free to take a trolley.


136
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.847
Now, wait just a minute.
This was not my idea.


137
00:18:19.972 --> 00:18:22.725
I've never heard of the Merrye family!
What is that?


138
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.896
They're our cousins, darling.
It behoves us to meet them.


139
00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:29.440
All right. I mean, you know, all right,

140
00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:32.777
but remember
that it was not my idea, OK?


141
00:18:32.902 --> 00:18:34.529
Of course not, darling.

142
00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:37.907
You don't have ideas,
baby Peter brother.


143
00:18:40.827 --> 00:18:42.662
- Hm.
- Huh!


144
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:57.844
What makes you think
this is the right road?


145
00:18:57.969 --> 00:18:59.512
It's got to be!

146
00:19:08.938 --> 00:19:10.648
Ha! There, you see!

147
00:19:20.032 --> 00:19:21.367
Hm.

148
00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:23.870
So...

149
00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:25.580
This...

150
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.416
...is it.

151
00:19:28.541 --> 00:19:32.837
I don't see any sign of whatshisname?
Uh, the lawyer.


152
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.883
Obviously, he hasn't arrived as yet.

153
00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:41.387
The caretaker here probably went
to meet him in a horse and buggy.


154
00:19:56.277 --> 00:19:58.529
Might as well go on up.

155
00:19:58.654 --> 00:20:01.157
They'll be along any minute.
Why don't we...?


156
00:20:02.408 --> 00:20:04.994
What's the matter, Peter?
Chicken?


157
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:08.122
I just don't think it's right
to go barging in on somebody


158
00:20:08.247 --> 00:20:09.624
that you're about to sue.

159
00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:14.420
Well, just remember
we're trying to avoid that expense,


160
00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:15.880
if possible.

161
00:20:16.005 --> 00:20:19.425
Well, I'll leave that up to you.

162
00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.346
What happened?
You saw a ghost, right?


163
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.848
Don't be funny!

164
00:21:48.973 --> 00:21:51.976
There was a... 
There was an awful...

165
00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:55.104
A baboon!

166
00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:58.190
Well, let's not have
a complete double-duck fit.


167
00:22:45.905 --> 00:22:47.740
Uh, Mr Schlocker,

168
00:22:47.865 --> 00:22:51.202
I think he means
that you open the window from inside.


169
00:22:51.327 --> 00:22:53.412
Hm, yes.

170
00:22:57.416 --> 00:23:00.169
What's going on here?
Why have we stopped?


171
00:23:00.294 --> 00:23:03.172
- They're blasting up ahead, sir.
- They're what?


172
00:23:06.092 --> 00:23:08.302
Blasting, sir. 
For the new highway.

173
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:11.931
Well, we better wait it out,
I suppose.


174
00:23:12.056 --> 00:23:15.309
Yes, sir. They won't be long, sir.
Mr Sharker.


175
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:19.355
The name is Schlocker, Mr Bruno.

176
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.940
Oh! Please, sir...

177
00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:23.526
Er, Bruno.
Just plain Bruno, sir.


178
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:26.070
Oh, very well, Bruno.

179
00:23:26.195 --> 00:23:31.075
I wanna tell you I appreciate
your cooperation in this matter.


180
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.411
I wasn't expecting it, frankly.

181
00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:37.331
Cooperation, sir?

182
00:23:37.456 --> 00:23:38.958
Well, yes.

183
00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:41.877
To tell you the truth,
I was fully prepared


184
00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:44.380
to avail myself of the services
of a marshal,


185
00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.257
should it be necessary.

186
00:23:46.382 --> 00:23:49.301
Well, thanks to your cooperation
it isn't.


187
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:54.306
I appreciate that and I'll do my best
to see that you're not forgotten.


188
00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:58.227
Forgotten, sir?
I... l-l don't quite understand.


189
00:23:58.352 --> 00:24:01.897
Well, in the...
in the disposition of the estate.


190
00:24:02.022 --> 00:24:05.568
Um, I firmly believe that so many years
of faithful service


191
00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:09.822
should not go unrewarded,
no matter how ill-advised.


192
00:24:10.573 --> 00:24:11.824
Thank you, sir.

193
00:24:11.949 --> 00:24:16.871
Now, Bruno, I'd like to ask
a few questions, if you don't mind.


194
00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:19.206
Very well, sir. 
Go ahead, sir.

195
00:24:20.082 --> 00:24:24.462
Now, it is my understanding
that for the past several years


196
00:24:24.587 --> 00:24:27.673
you have been the sole custodian

197
00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:30.634
of the three children
of the late Titus W. Merrye.


198
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.094
Is that correct?

199
00:24:32.219 --> 00:24:35.681
As you say, sir,
for some many years.


200
00:24:35.806 --> 00:24:40.144
And that the same three children
have never been allowed the benefits


201
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:42.188
of any sort of formal schooling?

202
00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:43.606
Oh, no, sir.

203
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:46.400
The Master wouldn't have allowed that.

204
00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:48.527
And professional medical care?

205
00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:50.738
Oh, on the contrary, sir.

206
00:24:50.863 --> 00:24:53.866
I assure you there have been
regular and frequent visits, sir.


207
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:55.618
You mean they're not well?

208
00:24:55.743 --> 00:24:59.997
Well, er...
As well as could be expected, sir.


209
00:25:00.122 --> 00:25:03.834
You see,
they're not... ordinary children.


210
00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:08.172
I'm sure we can all agree
to that, Bruno, but nevertheless...


211
00:25:08.297 --> 00:25:11.467
You see, they're...
Well, you might call them retarded.


212
00:25:11.592 --> 00:25:12.885
Retarded?

213
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.056
Well, I should think so, nearly full grown
and never a clay of school.


214
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:21.393
No, sir. I-I-I don't think you understand,
Mr Sharker.


215
00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:23.896
I'm afraid YOU don't understand,
my dear fellow.


216
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:30.110
There are properly qualified institutions
for the care of the... the deprived.


217
00:25:30.236 --> 00:25:33.739
Especially when there are
substantial estates to be administered.


218
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.035
Frankly, I find the whole affair
rather shocking.


219
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.207
I may add there are proper
judicial remedies for such abuses.


220
00:25:53.384 --> 00:25:56.846
I don't think the Master would like this.

221
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.307
Come on, buddy.
Let's get this car out of here.


222
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:02.393
Yes sir.

223
00:26:22.913 --> 00:26:25.040
Ah, my dear Miss Howe.

224
00:26:25.165 --> 00:26:27.001
So nice to see you here!

225
00:26:27.626 --> 00:26:29.628
And the young Mr Howe!

226
00:26:29.753 --> 00:26:32.423
- Hi, Schlocker. How are you?
- Good to see you, my boy.


227
00:26:32.548 --> 00:26:35.342
Pete, this is my secretary,
Miss Morris.


228
00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:37.428
- Hi, Miss Morris. How do you do?
- Hi.


229
00:26:37.553 --> 00:26:39.430
Skip the rest of it, Schlocker.

230
00:26:40.514 --> 00:26:42.683
Let's go in
and take a look at the place.


231
00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:47.354
Oh, yes. I... I've been away
from the children too long already.


232
00:26:47.479 --> 00:26:51.400
You just follow me and I'll show you
where to park your machine.


233
00:26:51.525 --> 00:26:53.944
But if I may ask a favour, please.

234
00:26:55.362 --> 00:26:57.448
Please treat the children tactfully.

235
00:26:57.573 --> 00:27:00.159
You see, they're not accustomed
to strangers


236
00:27:00.284 --> 00:27:04.371
and they might
act wild if... if encouraged.


237
00:27:10.169 --> 00:27:14.840
Now, ladies, this is your Auntie Emily
and your Uncle Peter.


238
00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:17.426
Elizabeth and Virginia.

239
00:27:18.552 --> 00:27:21.764
That's two pretty names
for two such pretty young ladies.


240
00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:23.933
- This is Miss, er...
- Ann.


241
00:27:24.058 --> 00:27:25.517
Ann.

242
00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:27.895
Um, Ralph. Where's Ralph?

243
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.980
Ralph? Ralph!

244
00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:31.565
Virginia!

245
00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:36.487
Ralph! R
-R
-Ralphy!

246
00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:38.656
Virginia.

247
00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:41.909
Ralph!
R-R-R-R-Ralph! Ralph!


248
00:27:47.915 --> 00:27:49.291
Ralph.

249
00:27:54.797 --> 00:27:57.257
Oh, he's all right, Emily.

250
00:27:57.383 --> 00:27:58.634
He's just a big kid!

251
00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:01.095
Yes, it's like you say, sir.

252
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.889
He's just a... a big kid.

253
00:28:06.725 --> 00:28:08.352
Now see here, Bruno,

254
00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:12.106
you don't seem to realise
just how serious all this is.


255
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:15.484
Now, these... children

256
00:28:15.609 --> 00:28:18.988
are obviously in need
of qualified professional care.


257
00:28:19.113 --> 00:28:20.698
Wouldn't you say?

258
00:28:20.823 --> 00:28:23.575
Well, there's a great deal
in what you say, sir,


259
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.495
but I gave their father
a solemn oath


260
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.581
that I'd never allow
their unfortunate malady


261
00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:32.084
to become the object
of public scrutiny.


262
00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:33.961
Nonsense!

263
00:28:34.086 --> 00:28:37.464
The days when we hid our insane
behind walls of shame


264
00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:40.259
went outwith...
with that old car of yours.


265
00:28:40.384 --> 00:28:44.346
- They're talking about us, Virginia.
- I know.


266
00:28:44.471 --> 00:28:48.017
But Mr Sharker,
an oath to a dying man,


267
00:28:48.142 --> 00:28:49.727
that can't be taken lightly.

268
00:28:49.852 --> 00:28:52.688
Now, Bruno,
what do you mean by "malady"?


269
00:28:53.439 --> 00:28:56.567
I mean... Well, I've seen backward kids.
Is it...?


270
00:28:56.692 --> 00:28:59.945
Well, no.
I-I-It's... It's more than a retardation.


271
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.906
It's a sort of a regression,

272
00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:06.702
a progressive deterioration
of the mental faculties.


273
00:29:06.827 --> 00:29:09.121
A rotting of the brain,
so to speak.


274
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:12.750
It... begins in late-childhood

275
00:29:12.875 --> 00:29:15.544
and... progresses rapidly,

276
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:19.715
ultimately resulting
in... physical deformity.


277
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.219
Rather like the last stages of paresis.

278
00:29:24.344 --> 00:29:26.305
- Really that bad?
- Yes.


279
00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:31.393
The Merrye family,
or at least this branch of them,


280
00:29:31.518 --> 00:29:34.229
have been afflicted for generations.

281
00:29:34.354 --> 00:29:36.482
And I'm sorry to say, sir, I...

282
00:29:36.607 --> 00:29:38.776
I think this is the last generation.

283
00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:40.402
What a shame.

284
00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:43.739
Bruno, you mean all three of these...?

285
00:29:44.698 --> 00:29:46.241
Yes, sir.

286
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.536
The unfortunate result of...

287
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:50.996
inbreeding.

288
00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:54.708
Never mind that now, Bruno.
We can go into that at the proper time.


289
00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:56.585
Hmm... now let's see.

290
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.379
Yes, I would like to know
the whereabouts


291
00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:02.216
of certain other members
of the Merrye family,


292
00:30:02.341 --> 00:30:05.803
the two sisters of Titus W. Merrye

293
00:30:05.928 --> 00:30:09.932
and brother named,
I believe... Nedrick Merrye.


294
00:30:10.641 --> 00:30:12.017
If alive.

295
00:30:13.143 --> 00:30:17.272
Alive? Well, you might say so, sir.

296
00:30:17.397 --> 00:30:19.775
Come on, Bruno.
Don't beat around the bush.


297
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.111
Are they around or not?

298
00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:24.780
They're talking about Uncle Ned.

299
00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:26.240
I know.

300
00:30:26.365 --> 00:30:28.117
Well, I-i-it became necessary

301
00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:32.830
to put them in a...
a more private sort of an institution.


302
00:30:32.955 --> 00:30:34.915
My good man,

303
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.792
are you saying that you...

304
00:30:38.043 --> 00:30:43.048
...that the family chauffeur has been
in sole charge of this entire estate


305
00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:45.092
and these minor children?

306
00:30:45.217 --> 00:30:48.011
Oh, I never thought
of it that way, sir.

307
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:50.264
You see,
I promised the Master that...


308
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:54.143
Yeah, we know all about that.
Listen, Schlocker, it's been a long trip.


309
00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:57.271
I'd like to get cleaned up
and get off my feet for a while.


310
00:30:57.396 --> 00:30:59.439
We can go through this
after dinner.


311
00:30:59.565 --> 00:31:00.941
Dinner?

312
00:31:01.066 --> 00:31:05.028
Yes, it is dinner time. Matter of fact,
Bruno, we intend to spend the night.


313
00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:08.740
Oh, no, sir.
That's quite impossible.


314
00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:11.994
Why, why...
We're not prepared for guests.


315
00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:14.288
There seems to be
a difference of opinion


316
00:31:14.413 --> 00:31:18.083
as to who is the guest
and who the host here.


317
00:31:21.044 --> 00:31:23.797
You do have food in the house,
don%you?


318
00:31:23.922 --> 00:31:26.216
Why, yes.

319
00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:29.136
Y-Y-You see,
our diet is very austere.


320
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:32.681
But I-l suppose
we could find something.


321
00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:37.895
Yes. Yes, I suppose we could!

322
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.688
Uh-huh.

323
00:31:49.364 --> 00:31:51.825
I smell a bug.

324
00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.915
A...

325
00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:03.212
...big, black, juicy...

326
00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:37.496
I am proud of you, Virginia.
You're doing so well.


327
00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:43.835
Ralph is ready, Bruno.

328
00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:46.588
Oh, thank you, Elizabeth.
Bring him right down.


329
00:32:51.927 --> 00:32:54.805
My dear, there's no doubt in my mind
that we have here


330
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.767
an absolutely clear-cut
<i>prima facie</i> open-and-shut case.


331
00:32:58.892 --> 00:33:03.772
Great. Now, all I want to know
is what is it worth in dollars and cents?


332
00:33:03.897 --> 00:33:07.567
Well, that's... that's a little difficult
to tell at this juncture.


333
00:33:07.693 --> 00:33:11.405
Perhaps with an audit...
Miss Morris, give me schedule B.


334
00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.156
Right here, Mr Schlocker.

335
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:16.910
Of course, this is only the visible part
of the iceberg, so to speak.


336
00:33:17.035 --> 00:33:20.539
With more information,
we can project the curve...


337
00:33:20.664 --> 00:33:23.417
Hey. Hiya, Ralph!

338
00:33:23.542 --> 00:33:25.210
Everybody, look at Ralph.

339
00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:27.129
He's gotten all dressed up for us.

340
00:33:28.797 --> 00:33:30.507
Oh, yes, isn't he cute?

341
00:33:49.526 --> 00:33:53.155
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.


342
00:33:54.406 --> 00:33:55.949
Well, at last!

343
00:33:56.074 --> 00:33:57.826
Thank you, Virginia.

344
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:00.495
That was very good, Virginia!

345
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.831
Can I feed Winifred now?

346
00:34:02.956 --> 00:34:06.626
Winif... Oh, no, no. Not now!
Can't she wait?


347
00:34:06.752 --> 00:34:10.047
If she gets hungry,
she'll go looking for something to eat.


348
00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:12.758
Oh, in that case,
you go right ahead,


349
00:34:12.883 --> 00:34:14.676
but hurry up, hurry up,
all right?


350
00:34:14.801 --> 00:34:16.178
I Will, I Will!

351
00:34:19.097 --> 00:34:21.141
Hungry, Miss Morris?

352
00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:23.935
Oh, yes. I'm famished.

353
00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:26.104
Shall we then?

354
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.192
Well, there we are.
Er, just sit wherever you like.


355
00:34:30.776 --> 00:34:34.863
We're not very formal here
at Merrye house.


356
00:34:34.988 --> 00:34:37.741
We haven't had guests
in a long time.


357
00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:40.619
No, it's-it's-it's been a long, long time.

358
00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:44.122
I-I-I might add
that it's a great pleasure.


359
00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:49.878
You can sit down now, Ralph.

360
00:35:06.144 --> 00:35:08.980
Winifred? Winifred?

361
00:35:23.912 --> 00:35:26.748
Barney, you came back!

362
00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:31.545
Naughty Winifred, you didn't tell me.

363
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.964
Virginia?
We're waiting for you.


364
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:52.149
Sit in your chair, 
Virginia, please.

365
00:36:00.907 --> 00:36:02.284
<i>Voila</i>!

366
00:36:06.037 --> 00:36:08.957
What... is that?

367
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:12.627
Well, that's rabbit, obviously.

368
00:36:14.254 --> 00:36:17.048
Not bad, Bruno.
Looks done to a turn.


369
00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:19.926
Thank you, sir! 
I hope you enjoy it.

370
00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:23.430
We're very fortunate
to have meat for our guests.


371
00:36:23.555 --> 00:36:25.765
You see, we're vegetarians.

372
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:27.100
Vegetarians?

373
00:36:27.225 --> 00:36:30.645
It's dead.
We don't eat dead things.


374
00:36:32.522 --> 00:36:35.108
- Good Lord, man! Why...?
- The Master.


375
00:36:35.233 --> 00:36:37.360
Don't say it, you made a promise?

376
00:36:38.278 --> 00:36:40.655
It was no idle whim, I assure you.

377
00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:43.158
The Master knew of the grave danger.

378
00:36:43.283 --> 00:36:44.951
The danger?

379
00:36:45.076 --> 00:36:47.746
Yes, Bruno, what is that
supposed to mean?


380
00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:51.208
Well, the Master believed,
and he should know,


381
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:55.337
that the eating of flesh would hasten
the progress of their condition.


382
00:36:55.462 --> 00:36:57.297
Now I've heard everything!

383
00:36:57.422 --> 00:36:58.965
Wait a minute, Bruno.

384
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.885
You mean like that story
about the lion cub who's tame


385
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.888
until he gets his first taste
of fresh meat, right?


386
00:37:05.013 --> 00:37:07.641
I'm afraid it's even more serious
than that, sir.


387
00:37:10.393 --> 00:37:14.022
Well... whatever that is,

388
00:37:14.147 --> 00:37:17.234
rabbit or what... ever...

389
00:37:18.527 --> 00:37:19.819
...I pass.

390
00:37:19.945 --> 00:37:22.948
Well, it looks good to me.
Hey, I'll carve.


391
00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:26.451
Thank you, sir. Carry on.

392
00:37:27.827 --> 00:37:29.663
Oh, and I must tell you all

393
00:37:29.788 --> 00:37:32.290
you have Ralph here to thank
for providing it.


394
00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:34.251
Is that right?
Good for you, Ralph.


395
00:37:38.004 --> 00:37:41.132
I'll... I'll have something else.

396
00:37:45.387 --> 00:37:46.721
Thank you.

397
00:37:47.389 --> 00:37:48.807
What do you call these?

398
00:37:48.932 --> 00:37:52.269
Ah, a rare treat. 
Our favourite dish.

399
00:37:52.394 --> 00:37:56.022
- We call it souffléd fungi.
- What?


400
00:37:57.065 --> 00:37:58.483
Mushrooms, Schlocker.

401
00:37:58.608 --> 00:38:01.403
- Oh, mushrooms.
- Yes.


402
00:38:01.528 --> 00:38:05.448
A real staple.
They grow profusely on the grounds.


403
00:38:06.116 --> 00:38:08.410
And... did Ralph...?

404
00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:10.579
Oh, no, no.

405
00:38:10.704 --> 00:38:12.706
Virginia provided these.

406
00:38:12.831 --> 00:38:15.375
She has an uncanny knack
for picking only the...


407
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.212
...non-poisonous ones.

408
00:38:21.506 --> 00:38:23.883
Come on.
Let's not hog this stuff.


409
00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:29.014
There you go.

410
00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:33.977
Thank you, Uncle Peter.

411
00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.814
Thank you, Uncle Peter.

412
00:38:37.939 --> 00:38:40.817
Hey, Schlocker, you can't certainly
say they're not polite.


413
00:38:48.116 --> 00:38:51.828
Oh, Miss Howe, if you don't
feel up to the heavier fare,


414
00:38:51.953 --> 00:38:55.165
perhaps you'd like to try
some of our fresh garden greens.


415
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.084
Yeah, Emily. Here. 
Try the salad.

416
00:39:02.088 --> 00:39:03.423
Urgh.

417
00:39:03.923 --> 00:39:05.258
Allow me.

418
00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:10.138
This thing isn't dressed.

419
00:39:19.105 --> 00:39:20.815
Isn't Ralph a vegetarian, too?

420
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.903
Oh, yes, but Ralph's allowed
to eat anything that he catches.


421
00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:28.323
Oh!

422
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:47.384
Emily, this is very good.
You don't know what you're missing.


423
00:39:47.509 --> 00:39:50.845
Oh, as I told you,
our diet is very austere.


424
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.972
But it's most healthy.

425
00:39:53.098 --> 00:39:55.725
That's great.
Everybody ought to eat like that.


426
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.727
Oh, we have our delicacies, too,

427
00:39:57.852 --> 00:39:59.854
but they're not in season right now.

428
00:40:05.443 --> 00:40:08.321
Oh, no, no, sir.
You wouldn't want any of that.


429
00:40:12.158 --> 00:40:14.119
Oh, no. I guess not.

430
00:40:15.995 --> 00:40:17.330
Urrrgh.

431
00:40:29.676 --> 00:40:32.679
What do you think about
spending the night now, Emily?


432
00:40:33.388 --> 00:40:36.057
You couldn't drag me away, Peter.

433
00:40:36.182 --> 00:40:38.685
Good show, my dear.
I'm with you.


434
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.687
Oh, it's like I told you, sir. It's...

435
00:40:40.812 --> 00:40:42.897
There's nothing more to say, Bruno.

436
00:40:43.022 --> 00:40:45.859
Now, now,
let's make things easy on yourself.


437
00:40:45.984 --> 00:40:47.610
We want to be fair.

438
00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:52.615
The sisters can move in together
and you and... Ralph.


439
00:40:53.324 --> 00:40:56.661
Well... we might do that.

440
00:40:56.786 --> 00:41:00.165
Oh, no. No! I-It's quite impossible.
It's too dangerous.


441
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.793
You see, this is an old building.

442
00:41:03.918 --> 00:41:05.545
The wood is rotten.

443
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.381
You'd... you'd have to know your way
about in the dark.


444
00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:12.177
Nonsense! The next thing you'll tell us
it's haunted.


445
00:41:12.302 --> 00:41:14.721
Haun...?
Oh, no. Nothing like that.


446
00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:17.182
He means they're vampires.

447
00:41:17.307 --> 00:41:19.684
Oh, yes, and werewolves.

448
00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:21.811
Are you a horror film fan,
Miss Morris?


449
00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:25.190
Oh, yes, I love it.
"Dracula", "Frankenstein".


450
00:41:25.315 --> 00:41:26.357
And "The Mummy"?

451
00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:30.195
Oh, "The Mummy". I love
"The Mummy"! The way he walks.


452
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.865
Step, scrape. Step, scrape.

453
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.826
Oh, and the Wolf Man.

454
00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:41.206
There's going to be
a full moon tonight.


455
00:42:04.771 --> 00:42:07.065
Er... Er, Mr Schlocker,

456
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.984
I mean, I-i-if you don't need me
any more tonight,


457
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:12.529
I could just as well stay in...
down at...


458
00:42:12.654 --> 00:42:14.656
There's an inn in the village.

459
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:18.076
As I see it,
there are only two rooms, anyway.


460
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:23.289
Peter, if you took the car, do you think
you could find lodgings for Miss Morris?


461
00:42:23.414 --> 00:42:25.667
Yeah. I saw a motel, coming in, yeah.

462
00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:28.545
Fine, fine. Good idea.

463
00:42:29.128 --> 00:42:31.339
Be sure you have her
back on time, young man.


464
00:42:31.464 --> 00:42:33.925
- Busy day ahead, you know.
- Don't worry.


465
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.552
Thank you, Mr Howe.

466
00:42:35.677 --> 00:42:37.595
You're very welcome.

467
00:42:38.263 --> 00:42:41.307
Children, some of our guests
are going to stay the night.


468
00:42:41.432 --> 00:42:43.977
Would you come and help me
prepare their rooms?


469
00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:46.145
Yes, Bruno.

470
00:42:49.315 --> 00:42:51.943
Spider!

471
00:42:53.945 --> 00:42:55.613
- Ugh.
- Got it.


472
00:42:56.281 --> 00:42:58.491
I hate spiders.

473
00:43:00.994 --> 00:43:03.288
We have lots of spiders.

474
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.834
Do you like spiders, Mr Howe?

475
00:43:07.959 --> 00:43:10.670
Oh, sure, Virginia. 
I love spiders!

476
00:43:11.337 --> 00:43:14.591
Do you? Would you like
to play spider with me?


477
00:43:14.716 --> 00:43:18.845
- Virginia...
- Sure. I'll play spider with you.


478
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.555
Maybe tomorrow?

479
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.933
I'm sorry, Mr Howe,
that we couldn't accommodate everyone,


480
00:43:24.058 --> 00:43:26.185
but I'll be looking forward
to seeing you tomorrow.


481
00:43:26.311 --> 00:43:27.520
Me, too, Bruno.

482
00:43:27.645 --> 00:43:29.355
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you very much.


483
00:43:31.816 --> 00:43:33.443
Good night, kids.

484
00:43:33.568 --> 00:43:36.571
Well, Miss Morris,
we should be getting an early start.


485
00:43:36.696 --> 00:43:38.573
I'd like that very much, Mr Howe.

486
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:47.957
Hey!

487
00:43:50.752 --> 00:43:55.340
This is the phoniest setup
I've ever seen.


488
00:43:59.177 --> 00:44:01.679
There is something terribly wrong here

489
00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:04.432
and I intend to find out
exactly what it is.


490
00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:11.314
There we go.

491
00:44:14.817 --> 00:44:16.903
Say, it's still early, Miss Morris.

492
00:44:17.028 --> 00:44:20.406
Perhaps you'd like to have a drink
at that inn in the village


493
00:44:20.531 --> 00:44:21.783
that Bruno mentioned.

494
00:44:21.908 --> 00:44:23.409
I'd like that very much, Mr Howe.

495
00:44:23.534 --> 00:44:26.287
Oh, and maybe a sandwich
if you don't mind.


496
00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:42.845
Virginia?

497
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:46.474
Virginia?

498
00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:48.768
- Boo!
- Shh!


499
00:44:49.894 --> 00:44:52.021
Are you going to kiss Daddy
good night?


500
00:44:52.146 --> 00:44:55.692
Mm-hm.
Elizabeth, are you scared?


501
00:44:57.151 --> 00:44:58.695
Scared of what?

502
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.114
You know. Those people.

503
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:04.283
I hate them.

504
00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:06.911
You're not supposed to hate.

505
00:45:07.036 --> 00:45:10.915
You should, too.
They don't like spiders.


506
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.500
I know.

507
00:45:14.544 --> 00:45:20.258
That little man looks
just like a big fat bug, doesn't he?


508
00:45:21.884 --> 00:45:24.137
Yes, he does.

509
00:45:28.057 --> 00:45:30.476
You know what I'd like to do?

510
00:45:33.521 --> 00:45:38.776
Is it really lots of fun
playing spider, Virginia?


511
00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:40.695
You bet.

512
00:45:52.874 --> 00:45:54.959
Coming to tuck you in, Daddy.

513
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.427
Nighty-night, Daddy.

514
00:49:34.804 --> 00:49:36.138
Huh?

515
00:55:37.082 --> 00:55:39.835
Now, now, see here.

516
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.670
This won't do.

517
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.090
This has gone quite far enough.

518
00:55:46.216 --> 00:55:47.676
Ladies.

519
00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:54.642
Beyond the bounds of prudence
and good taste.


520
00:56:01.148 --> 00:56:04.943
I don't know what you people
are up to here, but...


521
00:56:07.071 --> 00:56:11.075
but I'm going to have
to call in the authorities.


522
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.077
Now, there are laws.

523
00:56:15.788 --> 00:56:17.247
Criminal laws...

524
00:56:18.874 --> 00:56:21.794
Kill him! Kill him!

525
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:24.755
No, this isn't right.
There are proper procedures.


526
00:56:26.215 --> 00:56:27.549
Special remedies.

527
00:56:29.093 --> 00:56:31.178
Please! Let me go, ladies!

528
00:56:31.303 --> 00:56:33.389
Kill him!

529
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:46.837
Now we can put him right back
in his own bed.


530
00:57:46.962 --> 00:57:48.464
Bruno will never have to...

531
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.178
Please don't hate me!
I didn't mean to do it!


532
00:57:54.303 --> 00:57:57.848
She made me do it!
She made me do it, Bruno!


533
00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:01.018
Well, he was spying on us.

534
00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:04.188
Well, he was gonna tell.

535
00:58:04.313 --> 00:58:06.523
He was gonna tell on us, Bruno.

536
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.111
Yes, Elizabeth, he was gonna tell.

537
00:58:13.447 --> 00:58:16.116
And don't you worry, Virginia,

538
00:58:16.867 --> 00:58:18.577
I'm not gonna hate you.

539
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:23.582
I knew
this was coming some day.


540
00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:26.585
But it's so soon.

541
00:58:28.253 --> 00:58:30.798
And you really and truly
don't hate me?


542
00:58:33.342 --> 00:58:36.929
I promised your daddy
I'd never, never hate you.


543
00:58:37.054 --> 00:58:38.722
You did?

544
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.141
You ought to hate him.

545
00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:45.562
Elizabeth, I told you
it isn't nice to hate.


546
00:58:47.815 --> 00:58:51.610
Children, l-l-I've got something
I want to tell you


547
00:58:51.735 --> 00:58:55.364
and I want you
to listen very, very carefully.


548
00:58:59.076 --> 00:59:03.205
A long, long time ago,
I promised your daddy


549
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:07.835
that I'd take care of you and Ralph
for ever and ever.


550
00:59:10.045 --> 00:59:14.258
And then... came this Mr Shlocker.

551
00:59:14.383 --> 00:59:18.136
He was a nasty, mean man.

552
00:59:18.262 --> 00:59:23.308
He wanted to take you away where
old Bruno would never see you again.


553
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:27.479
But...

554
00:59:29.106 --> 00:59:31.149
...you hurt Mr Schlocker...

555
00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:34.403
...and he can't do that now.

556
00:59:36.113 --> 00:59:39.283
But soon there will be more
Mr Schlockers


557
00:59:39.408 --> 00:59:42.744
and they'll be nastier and meaner
than he was and...


558
00:59:44.705 --> 00:59:47.666
You won't be able
to hurt all of them because...


559
00:59:49.293 --> 00:59:51.086
...there will be too many of them.

560
00:59:51.753 --> 00:59:54.381
They can't take me
away from you, Bruno.


561
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:57.217
They can't make me go away!

562
00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.929
You won't let them, will you, Bruno?

563
01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.975
I promised your daddy I wouldn't.

564
01:00:06.184 --> 01:00:07.978
I knew you wouldn't, Bruno.

565
01:00:09.396 --> 01:00:10.981
I'm not afraid.

566
01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:17.696
Well, we didn't have
much time anyway.


567
01:00:19.197 --> 01:00:24.745
Pretty soon Ralph, he'll be... ready
to join Uncle Ned and Aunt Claire.


568
01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:29.207
And then you.

569
01:00:30.584 --> 01:00:33.503
We wanna stay here
for ever and ever, Bruno,


570
01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:37.215
with you and Ralph and Uncle Ned.

571
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.846
We will. I promise.

572
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:45.849
For ever and ever. We will.

573
01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:47.476
You know...

574
01:00:48.602 --> 01:00:51.480
...I-I-I know
where there's a nice new toy.


575
01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:55.275
It'll do a wonderful thing.

576
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.818
A toy?

577
01:00:56.944 --> 01:01:01.448
Yes! And you can stay up late
just to see it.


578
01:01:01.573 --> 01:01:03.700
- Can we?
- Uh-huh.


579
01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:07.955
Now, I have to go
a little ways to get it,


580
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.499
but it'll only take me a little while.

581
01:01:10.624 --> 01:01:12.709
Please don't go, away, Bruno.

582
01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:14.169
I'm scared.

583
01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:16.380
It won't take but a few minutes.

584
01:01:17.756 --> 01:01:19.257
And I'll be back. Now...

585
01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:21.551
Elizabeth,

586
01:01:22.511 --> 01:01:25.847
I expect you to take care
of your brother and sister


587
01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:28.016
and see that they don't get
in any trouble.


588
01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:30.143
Will you do that?

589
01:01:30.268 --> 01:01:31.979
Oh, I will, Bruno.

590
01:01:34.815 --> 01:01:36.233
Huh.

591
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:51.623
Oh!

592
01:02:23.363 --> 01:02:25.073
Schlocker?

593
01:02:25.198 --> 01:02:29.161
Schlocker? Schlocker?
Schlock...?


594
01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:33.749
Schlocker!

595
01:02:37.919 --> 01:02:39.421
She'll tell!

596
01:02:49.139 --> 01:02:52.100
- Catch her! Catch her!
- Don't let her get away!


597
01:02:58.565 --> 01:03:00.567
- She'll tell!
- Catch her!


598
01:03:50.784 --> 01:03:53.161
Aunt Emily?

599
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.040
Aunt Emily?

600
01:03:58.291 --> 01:03:59.835
Where did she go?

601
01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:24.651
Aunt Emily?

602
01:04:26.987 --> 01:04:28.488
There she goes!

603
01:04:28.613 --> 01:04:30.031
Get her! Get her!

604
01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.723
Hey, Liz.

605
01:04:58.768 --> 01:05:01.813
Hey... are you really
a Wolf fan,


606
01:05:01.938 --> 01:05:05.025
a Wolf Man fan, Ann?

607
01:05:05.817 --> 01:05:09.404
Oh, yes. I think that's
how every man should be.


608
01:05:09.529 --> 01:05:11.364
Like a wild beast.

609
01:05:19.831 --> 01:05:22.209
No vacancy again.

610
01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:23.793
That's the last one, Ann.

611
01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:27.172
There isn't another town for 50 miles.

612
01:05:27.297 --> 01:05:30.675
I guess we shouldn't have spent
all that time at the village inn.


613
01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.470
Yes. I didn't realise
how late it was getting.


614
01:05:33.595 --> 01:05:37.140
You lose count.
They keep taking away the glasses!


615
01:05:37.265 --> 01:05:39.684
I know, but I remember exactly
how many.


616
01:05:41.186 --> 01:05:43.313
Er, listen,
there's nothing we can do


617
01:05:43.438 --> 01:05:46.733
except go back and spend the night
with Emily and Schlocker.


618
01:06:00.205 --> 01:06:02.457
Got it! Got it!

619
01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:54.259
Urgh! Spiders aren't supposed
to eat other spiders.


620
01:06:54.384 --> 01:06:56.511
Cannibal spiders do.

621
01:07:17.949 --> 01:07:20.410
Bruno! Bruno!

622
01:07:21.286 --> 01:07:22.996
It doesn't sound like Bruno.

623
01:07:23.538 --> 01:07:26.499
Oh, no, it's Uncle Peter
and that pretty lady.


624
01:07:26.624 --> 01:07:28.293
They've come back.

625
01:07:28.418 --> 01:07:31.421
Virginia, you mustn't hurt anyone else.

626
01:07:31.546 --> 01:07:33.381
Bruno will really hate you.

627
01:07:33.965 --> 01:07:35.925
He will not.

628
01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:40.138
Anyway, I like Uncle Peter.
He's not like that bad man.


629
01:07:40.263 --> 01:07:42.599
All the same, they'll tell on us.

630
01:07:42.724 --> 01:07:44.059
Would they?

631
01:07:45.643 --> 01:07:47.395
Would they tell?

632
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:51.232
Of course, they'll tell. Bruno said
there would be others, didn't he?


633
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.196
They're coming. 
What do we do?

634
01:07:58.573 --> 01:08:00.617
We'll have to make a plan.

635
01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:11.169
Somebody's up and about.
Good.


636
01:08:11.294 --> 01:08:13.213
I hope it's not that Ralph.

637
01:08:13.338 --> 01:08:15.757
Oh, Ralph's just a big kid.

638
01:08:15.882 --> 01:08:18.218
- Do you really think so?
- Sure.


639
01:08:40.949 --> 01:08:42.617
Hiya, kids.

640
01:08:43.159 --> 01:08:47.539
Hey, Miss Morris and I are gonna have
to spend the night here after all.


641
01:08:47.664 --> 01:08:49.541
There's no room at the inn,
as they say.


642
01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:53.253
Good evening, Uncle Peter.

643
01:08:55.004 --> 01:08:56.339
Uh-huh.

644
01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:01.928
Er, is Mr Bruno about?

645
01:09:02.053 --> 01:09:06.474
No. No, he's away.
Won't you come in?


646
01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:08.935
Yes, do come in.

647
01:09:09.978 --> 01:09:13.356
Ah, how about Aunt Emily?
Is she around?


648
01:09:13.481 --> 01:09:15.108
Shh!

649
01:09:18.987 --> 01:09:22.740
- Oh, shh! Shh!
- Shh!


650
01:09:22.866 --> 01:09:25.869
There's really no need
to disturb anyone.


651
01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:28.371
All righty.
When does Mr Bruno get back?


652
01:09:28.496 --> 01:09:32.167
Shh. He'll be along by and by.

653
01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:36.171
Now, Uncle Peter,
you just make yourself right at home.


654
01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:40.383
Virginia, dear,
you may entertain Uncle Peter,


655
01:09:40.508 --> 01:09:43.219
while I take care of the pretty lady.

656
01:09:44.012 --> 01:09:45.472
Erm...

657
01:09:45.597 --> 01:09:48.391
Er, it's all right.

658
01:09:48.516 --> 01:09:49.934
It's all right.

659
01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:53.730
I'm sure Elizabeth knows what to do.

660
01:09:55.273 --> 01:09:57.275
Well, if you really think so.

661
01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.570
Sure. Listen, Emily is very easy
to get along with.


662
01:10:00.695 --> 01:10:02.113
When she's asleep!

663
01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:04.574
Well, that won't be necessary.

664
01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:07.911
Ann will have Daddy's room.

665
01:10:08.036 --> 01:10:10.497
It's really very nice.

666
01:10:10.622 --> 01:10:12.248
There you go. See?

667
01:10:12.373 --> 01:10:16.252
Thank you, Elizabeth.
You're really very kind.


668
01:10:19.839 --> 01:10:22.258
Well... good night.

669
01:10:22.383 --> 01:10:23.760
Yes.

670
01:10:24.761 --> 01:10:26.262
See you in the morning.

671
01:10:26.387 --> 01:10:29.599
Mm-hm. It was awfully nice.

672
01:10:29.724 --> 01:10:32.685
This way, pretty lady.

673
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.400
I'm glad you came back.

674
01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:42.654
I like you.

675
01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:48.368
I like you, too!

676
01:10:58.795 --> 01:11:00.505
You're a nice lady.

677
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.757
I liked you right away.

678
01:11:02.882 --> 01:11:04.759
You're not like those others.

679
01:11:04.884 --> 01:11:07.971
Oh, Virginia, likes you, too.
And Ralph.


680
01:11:08.096 --> 01:11:09.639
We all like you.

681
01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:11.766
And Uncle Peter, too.

682
01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:18.856
You'd never tell,

683
01:11:18.982 --> 01:11:21.901
no matter what Bruno says.

684
01:11:25.405 --> 01:11:29.200
You'd never tell. 
I know you wouldn't.

685
01:11:29.993 --> 01:11:32.453
I like you, pretty lady.

686
01:11:33.538 --> 01:11:34.872
Pretty lady?

687
01:12:09.073 --> 01:12:12.577
And the big black spider
goes round and round


688
01:12:12.702 --> 01:12:16.122
and wraps the bug all up
in her spider web.


689
01:12:17.874 --> 01:12:23.046
Virginia, what happens when the spider
gets the bug all wrapped up in her web?


690
01:12:24.922 --> 01:12:27.008
Ah-ha! I won't tell!

691
01:12:27.884 --> 01:12:29.802
Ah! All right.

692
01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:33.181
How long does it take
to play this game?


693
01:12:33.306 --> 01:12:34.974
Oh, we're almost done.

694
01:12:35.099 --> 01:12:37.393
Oh, right.

695
01:12:37.518 --> 01:12:38.561
Oh.

696
01:12:38.686 --> 01:12:40.355
There now.

697
01:12:41.939 --> 01:12:43.816
Hm.

698
01:12:45.735 --> 01:12:46.986
Virginia?

699
01:12:54.952 --> 01:12:57.622
Hey, what does the spider do now?

700
01:12:57.747 --> 01:12:59.999
What? Oh, yes.

701
01:13:00.124 --> 01:13:05.588
Um, now the spider
does a little dance for the bug.


702
01:13:06.589 --> 01:13:08.716
She has to tease him.

703
01:13:08.841 --> 01:13:10.843
Taunt him.

704
01:13:10.968 --> 01:13:15.515
And make him wiggle,
so that his juice will taste better.


705
01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:22.063
Virginia, I think
we better play another game.


706
01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:27.527
Uncle Peter,
do you like that pretty lady?


707
01:13:28.736 --> 01:13:30.571
Yes. Yes, I do.

708
01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:44.168
Do you like... me?

709
01:13:47.463 --> 01:13:51.008
Uh... When does
Mr Bruno come back?


710
01:13:51.634 --> 01:13:54.053
Bruno won't hate me.
He promised.


711
01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:58.766
Spiders like bugs.

712
01:14:01.185 --> 01:14:02.854
They taste good.

713
01:14:07.525 --> 01:14:10.319
But I guess bugs
don't like spiders very much.


714
01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.946
I like spiders.

715
01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:13.990
I like spiders.

716
01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:16.492
I do, too.

717
01:14:16.617 --> 01:14:18.244
Well...

718
01:14:21.497 --> 01:14:24.792
- Guess I have to sting you now.
- You have to what?


719
01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.428
Virginia, what about Mr Schlocker?
Mr Schlocker?


720
01:14:36.512 --> 01:14:38.765
- Hey, Schlocker!
- Sting!


721
01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:47.482
Well, I have to
go away for a minute.

722
01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:54.822
But I'll be right back.

723
01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.243
Don't go away... bug.

724
01:15:08.544 --> 01:15:11.130
What are we gonna do with her?
Ralph can't let go.


725
01:15:16.177 --> 01:15:19.013
What do you mean
what are we going to do with her?


726
01:15:19.138 --> 01:15:21.182
Don't you know?
You made this plan.


727
01:15:21.307 --> 01:15:23.643
But I didn't have enough time
to finish it.


728
01:15:25.728 --> 01:15:31.150
She wiggles just like
a big squiggly bug in a spider web.


729
01:15:35.613 --> 01:15:37.406
Hm.

730
01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.700
Uncle Ned could make her quiet.

731
01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:42.954
No! Bruno would be very mad!

732
01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:46.290
Anyway, Ralph likes her, see.

733
01:15:47.416 --> 01:15:50.169
You mustn't hurt her.

734
01:15:50.294 --> 01:15:52.839
Just make her quiet.

735
01:15:57.426 --> 01:16:01.055
Now, Spider's very clever.

736
01:16:02.265 --> 01:16:05.935
She very cleverly

737
01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:11.190
drains the vital juices
from the bug's body.


738
01:16:13.317 --> 01:16:16.988
And that makes the bug
stop squiggling.


739
01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:21.492
Would that make her stop squiggling?

740
01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:28.124
Help me find something sharp.

741
01:17:14.378 --> 01:17:15.713
Ralph?

742
01:17:18.382 --> 01:17:21.886
Hold her still! All I need to do
is make a little neat cut.


743
01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.263
How much should we let run out?

744
01:17:25.181 --> 01:17:27.183
Just enough to make her quiet.

745
01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:29.268
Then Ralph can play with her better.

746
01:17:30.728 --> 01:17:32.355
Look out!

747
01:17:54.418 --> 01:17:55.753
Ralph?

748
01:17:55.878 --> 01:17:57.797
Emily?

749
01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:01.884
Ralph?

750
01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:05.304
No, Emily, I'm in here.
Where you been?


751
01:18:05.429 --> 01:18:07.223
For heaven's sake, give me a hand.

752
01:18:07.348 --> 01:18:09.892
That little fiend tied me up.

753
01:18:21.278 --> 01:18:22.697
Peter!

754
01:18:22.822 --> 01:18:24.532
I'm coming, Ann! Hold on!

755
01:19:25.593 --> 01:19:28.054
Help me!

756
01:19:51.744 --> 01:19:53.079
Children?

757
01:19:58.834 --> 01:20:00.628
That lady hurt Ralph.

758
01:20:01.253 --> 01:20:04.465
Ralph will be all well very soon.

759
01:20:06.175 --> 01:20:09.762
I brought that wonderful surprise
I promised you.


760
01:20:15.351 --> 01:20:18.104
Let me see it! Let me see it!
What is it?


761
01:20:19.605 --> 01:20:22.775
Uh
-Uh
-Uh! This is a secret surprise.

762
01:20:53.639 --> 01:20:57.268
Oh, sir, I don't know how you got
yourself into this predicament,


763
01:20:57.393 --> 01:21:01.730
but I suggest you leave the premises
as quickly as possible.


764
01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:03.357
Where's Ann?

765
01:21:03.482 --> 01:21:05.067
Ann? Where's Ann?

766
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:11.157
Ah!

767
01:21:16.287 --> 01:21:18.372
If I were you, 
I'd hurry, sir.

768
01:21:18.497 --> 01:21:20.708
I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying!

769
01:21:31.302 --> 01:21:32.928
What's it gonna do, Bruno?

770
01:21:33.053 --> 01:21:38.267
Well, it's gonna make
a big flash and go "bang"!


771
01:21:38.392 --> 01:21:40.811
Oh, boy!

772
01:21:46.442 --> 01:21:48.569
Lookie!

773
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.071
Uncle Ned!

774
01:22:12.551 --> 01:22:15.012
Yes, it was quite
an amazing experience.


775
01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:19.975
But, for me, anyway,
a lot of good came of this.


776
01:22:20.559 --> 01:22:22.895
Um, being the only survivor,

777
01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:26.065
naturally, I inherited
the wealth of the Merryes,


778
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:30.194
which, later,
turned out to be... quite vast!


779
01:22:31.487 --> 01:22:34.865
More important than that, though,
my wife.


780
01:22:36.283 --> 01:22:38.035
That's our daughter, Jessica.

781
01:22:43.499 --> 01:22:46.377
Mummy, may I go outside now?

782
01:22:48.337 --> 01:22:52.841
All right, Jessica, dear, but come back
into the house if it starts raining again.


783
01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.593
Oh, I will, Mummy.

784
01:23:08.065 --> 01:23:11.110
And so the Merrye syndrome

785
01:23:11.235 --> 01:23:14.405
was extinguished for ever
with the family that carried it.


786
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:20.577
Er, my own branch of the family,
being rather distant,


787
01:23:20.703 --> 01:23:23.289
we never suffered from the curse.
