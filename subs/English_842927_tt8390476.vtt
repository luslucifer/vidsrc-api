(dramatic music)

2
00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:18.600
(dramatic music continues)

3
00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:25.572
(stone grinding)

4
00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:36.483
(electronics beeping)

5
00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:44.391
(film whirring)

6
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.535
(wind blowing)

7
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.509
(birds chirping)

8
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.279
(dog barking)

9
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.049
(person whistling)

10
00:01:08.148 --> 00:01:11.184
(whistling continues)

11
00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:35.843
(whistling stops)

12
00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:53.961
(bluesy music playing)

13
00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:12.907
(music ends)

14
00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:24.417
(water dripping)

15
00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.861
- Good morning.

16
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:35.730
- Morning to you too.

17
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.497
- I couldn't sleep last night.

18
00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:40.668
These headaches are
just killing me.


19
00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:43.638
- Maybe it's time
we call a doctor.


20
00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:45.539
- Sure. Yeah.

21
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.408
Let me, let me
clear my schedule.


22
00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:50.878
Head straight to urgent care.

23
00:03:50.978 --> 00:03:52.345
- Didn't mean right now.

24
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:54.849
And I didn't mean
that kind of doctor.


25
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.483
- Oh, a shrink.

26
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.354
- Stephen, (laughing)
listen to me.


27
00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:04.258
I expect you to honor
the deal we made.


28
00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:06.093
I'm in charge now.

29
00:04:06.194 --> 00:04:08.162
I'm in charge of your health.

30
00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:09.797
So you better...

31
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.973
Nope. No time for
hanky panky. (laughing)


32
00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:22.844
We got two different buckets
of possums to deal with.


33
00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.112
- That means work, right?
- Yep.


34
00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:29.449
(Stephen sighing)
(pan sizzling)


35
00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:31.853
Alicia, I'm ready.
Let's get going.


36
00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:35.923
- What are you reading?

37
00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:37.457
- "Talking Texas."

38
00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:39.026
Maybe now I'll finally
be able to understand


39
00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.461
what the hell it is you're
saying half the time


40
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.363
- Whatever, city boy.

41
00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:44.932
Breakfast be ready in five.

42
00:04:45.032 --> 00:04:46.033
- Oh no time.

43
00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:47.534
We're running late as is.

44
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:49.203
Steve, you hadn't eaten
since lunch yesterday


45
00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:50.638
and we got a long road ahead.

46
00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:54.541
So park your bottom
in that seat.


47
00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:57.377
My favorite town in
Mexico, that church.


48
00:05:00.014 --> 00:05:03.317
Can't believe you're finally
gonna see it, darling.


49
00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:04.785
You're gonna love it.

50
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:08.656
- Baby, we are
going just as soon


51
00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:10.825
as I get that car
up and running.


52
00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:12.593
- All right, I'm
gonna run to the store


53
00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:17.098
and I'm gonna grab us some
extra food for the trip.


54
00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:23.536
Mwah! (laughing)

55
00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.512
(energetic music)

56
00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:44.325
(energetic music continues)

57
00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:47.094
(Stephen whistling)

58
00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:49.931
(car turning over)

59
00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:53.134
Damn it!

60
00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.646
(music continues)

61
00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:14.188
Yes baby, yes.

62
00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:20.928
(lively music playing on radio)

63
00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:23.731
(door jingles)

64
00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:34.909
(music continues)

65
00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:47.021
(dog barking)

66
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.457
(bird cawing)

67
00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:52.193
(dog barking)

68
00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:04.972
(music continues)

69
00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.514
Good morning, officers.

70
00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:18.419
I'm guessing you're
in need of some gas.


71
00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:20.621
- Please.

72
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.555
I haven't seen you before.

73
00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.158
Where's your, uh...

74
00:07:24.258 --> 00:07:26.861
- You know his health
isn't what he used to be.


75
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.163
Shouldn't be working
so much, you know.


76
00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:32.733
But he's a bit hardheaded.

77
00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.435
I think I eventually got
through to him though.


78
00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:35.803
- Well, I hope he's
feeling better.


79
00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.239
- Will you look at that>

80
00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:39.774
Sweet Challenger.

81
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.110
My cousin used to own a '72.

82
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.645
What year is she, '70/

83
00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:46.614
- Yeah, '70.

84
00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:48.883
That's right.

85
00:07:48.983 --> 00:07:50.484
Unfortunately she looks a
lot better than she runs.


86
00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:54.055
That'll be $41 and 72 cents.

87
00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:56.157
But don't worry
about the change.


88
00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:00.928
- She got a leak.

89
00:08:01.896 --> 00:08:04.265
- Oh yeah, I'm working on it.

90
00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:06.033
But that's just the radiator.

91
00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:07.535
I haven't found the spot yet,

92
00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:09.203
but there's all kinds

93
00:08:09.303 --> 00:08:10.938
of hidden headaches
when you're dealing


94
00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:13.573
with classics like
these, pains in the butt.


95
00:08:13.674 --> 00:08:16.010
- That's for damn sure. Yeah.

96
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.281
Plus can't fix something that
don't want to be fixed, right?


97
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:24.251
- Yeah.
- Do you mind?


98
00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:36.230
(energetic music on radio)

99
00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:38.432
Mm-hmm.

100
00:08:38.532 --> 00:08:40.701
- Yeah. She's a beauty

101
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.505
- 383 Magnum with the

102
00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:47.241
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.


103
00:08:48.642 --> 00:08:50.177
It's at 340.

104
00:08:52.646 --> 00:08:54.381
She yours?

105
00:08:54.482 --> 00:08:56.050
- I wish.

106
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.252
- Customer dropped it off then?

107
00:08:58.352 --> 00:08:59.720
- Yeah, just yesterday.

108
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.857
A couple of guys on
their way to Mexico.


109
00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.893
- You mind if I
take a look inside?


110
00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:07.628
- I don't think the
owners would probably


111
00:09:07.728 --> 00:09:09.330
want anyone in there.

112
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.198
- Yeah, let me worry about that.

113
00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:16.437
- So this customer, he
fill out some paperwork?


114
00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:18.005
- No, we're old school.

115
00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:19.707
I mean, he looked me in
the eye and shook my hand.


116
00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:22.209
That works just fine for me.

117
00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:23.944
- Alright, lemme
get this straight.


118
00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:27.515
So two men you've
never met, this car,


119
00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:32.219
drove all the way down here,
just drop it off, no paperwork


120
00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:34.989
and walked to Mexico?

121
00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:38.826
- I think they called an Uber.

122
00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:42.830
- Check the trunk.

123
00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:52.373
- Whoa.

124
00:09:52.473 --> 00:09:53.407
(dramatic music)

125
00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:54.542
- Oh shit, don't move.

126
00:09:54.643 --> 00:09:55.976
Put your hands behind your head.

127
00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:57.077
Get down on the floor right now.

128
00:09:57.178 --> 00:09:58.746
- That's, that's not mine!

129
00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:00.080
- Get down on the floor!
- Get down on the floor!


130
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:01.415
- Okay!
- On the floor, all the way!


131
00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:02.416
- This is not my car, you guys.

132
00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:03.450
This is not my car!

133
00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:04.552
(voices overlapping)

134
00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:05.654
- Don't move. Keep still.

135
00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:07.154
- You're making a mistake!

136
00:10:07.254 --> 00:10:09.256
- [Copy] You have the
right to remain silent.


137
00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:14.461
- Hey, this is just wrong.

138
00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.030
I, I don't belong here.

139
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.731
They're saying I'm a killer.

140
00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:19.033
This, this is insane,

141
00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:20.501
- Stephen, I hear you, but--

142
00:10:20.602 --> 00:10:22.236
- No, no, there's no buts.

143
00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.139
I'm being set up,
clean and simple.


144
00:10:27.107 --> 00:10:29.376
- I believe you're
a good man. I do.


145
00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.979
But the state kind of has
you by the balls here.


146
00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:32.681
- What?

147
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.115
Oh my...

148
00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:38.419
So what do you want me to do?

149
00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:40.054
- There aren't a lot of
options, unfortunately,


150
00:10:40.154 --> 00:10:41.889
but I did find
something in your files.


151
00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:44.491
Something that might
give us a chance.


152
00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:46.327
You're ex-military.

153
00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:48.229
- What does that have
to do with anything?


154
00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:49.730
- Can I finish?

155
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.332
- No, they're trying to pin
this on a poor working man


156
00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:52.766
while the guy that
did it walks free.


157
00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:54.068
Is that what you're telling me?

158
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:55.736
- Stephen, you had an episode

159
00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:57.838
a couple of years
back, didn't you?


160
00:10:57.938 --> 00:10:59.173
A psychotic breakdown.

161
00:10:59.273 --> 00:11:00.107
- Oh God.

162
00:11:00.207 --> 00:11:01.775
Who fed you this horseshit?

163
00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:04.912
- Headaches, insomnia,
erratic behavior,


164
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:07.682
and then a full on
psychological break.


165
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:09.516
The psychiatrist
thought you showed signs


166
00:11:09.618 --> 00:11:12.786
of bipolar disorder and
paranoid schizophrenia.


167
00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:14.021
- Oh no, I'm not going
through this shit again.


168
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:16.357
It was some minor PTSD.

169
00:11:16.457 --> 00:11:17.825
It was no big deal.

170
00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:20.060
I was having some issues
at home and at work


171
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.931
and it just got to me.

172
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.799
I mean, I only saw that
shrink a couple of times.


173
00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:27.301
He didn't even do
a full evaluation.


174
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:31.438
And what, what, where
did you even get this?


175
00:11:31.538 --> 00:11:34.541
- Our best shot is
in this diagnosis.


176
00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:35.876
- I'm not insane.

177
00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:38.245
- Stephen. This is Texas.

178
00:11:38.345 --> 00:11:40.381
The DA is pushing for
the death penalty.


179
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:43.250
They have your fingerprints
all over the car,


180
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.518
inside and out.

181
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:46.854
They even have hair
fibers on the bag


182
00:11:46.954 --> 00:11:48.155
the body was found in--

183
00:11:48.255 --> 00:11:50.991
- I was working on
the goddamn car!


184
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:52.526
Okay.
- Jesus.


185
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.531
- All right.

186
00:11:57.632 --> 00:12:00.200
- Stephen, you can take your
chances on a jury trial,


187
00:12:00.301 --> 00:12:04.238
but with all the
evidence, you'll lose.


188
00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:08.876
- I didn't do anything.

189
00:12:08.976 --> 00:12:11.245
I'll find you a top psychiatrist

190
00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:13.280
to back up your
doctor's diagnosis.


191
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.351
You'll even have a chance
to be a free man again soon.


192
00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:19.453
- I didn't do anything.

193
00:12:21.155 --> 00:12:22.923
- It's a good deal, Stephen.

194
00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:26.527
And the best one you'll get.
(tense music)


195
00:12:35.704 --> 00:12:38.505
(horns honking)

196
00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:46.046
The prosecutor agreed
to recommend the judge


197
00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:47.948
accept the plea just
like I promised.


198
00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:50.351
So it's done.

199
00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:52.119
You'll be transferred to St.
James Mental Health Center


200
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:54.321
where you will remain
until it is determined


201
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:56.791
that you no longer pose
a threat to society.


202
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.092
- How long is that gonna be?

203
00:12:58.192 --> 00:12:59.860
- I don't know, but I guarantee

204
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.630
that it will be far less than
a conviction would've been.


205
00:13:03.897 --> 00:13:05.432
Good luck, Stephen.

206
00:13:05.532 --> 00:13:07.534
This is an incredibly
difficult situation for you,


207
00:13:07.635 --> 00:13:10.070
but I know you'll
make the most of it.


208
00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:17.344
(tense music)

209
00:13:28.222 --> 00:13:31.358
(music continues)

210
00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:42.403
(music continues)

211
00:13:52.112 --> 00:13:53.981
- Hello Stephen.

212
00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:55.015
Welcome to St. James.

213
00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:56.818
I'm Dr. Fielder.

214
00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:58.385
Uncuff him now, please.

215
00:14:02.456 --> 00:14:04.024
Follow me.

216
00:14:08.897 --> 00:14:10.397
You must be worried,

217
00:14:10.497 --> 00:14:12.533
but I'm sure you'll find
the facility very welcoming.


218
00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:15.102
- So this is what a
nuthouse looks like.


219
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:17.337
It's not bad.

220
00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:20.708
- We like to call it a
mental health center.


221
00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:23.277
We focus on maintaining
whatever environment is most


222
00:14:23.377 --> 00:14:26.313
conducive to aid our
patients in their recovery.


223
00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:28.817
- Most conducive.

224
00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:30.852
That's interesting,

225
00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:34.054
- Stephen, I read your file.

226
00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:35.255
I know about your situation.

227
00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:36.724
- Well, then you know that I--

228
00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:40.628
- What I know that I can
help you if you let me.


229
00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:45.365
Follow me.

230
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:56.343
- Hey, are you new here?

231
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.514
- Uh, yeah, I guess.

232
00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:03.283
- Me too. I'm Jenny.

233
00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:05.552
- Hi Jenny.
- Have you seen Charlie?


234
00:15:07.054 --> 00:15:08.590
- Who's Charlie?
- He's my son.


235
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.892
The most beautiful
boy you've ever seen.


236
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:12.359
I can't find him anywhere.

237
00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:15.195
He can get so scared
when he's alone.


238
00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:19.199
- That's Jenny.

239
00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:21.502
- Well, she seems normal.

240
00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:41.522
- Stephen, take a seat.

241
00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:54.067
The name of the game
here is rehabilitation


242
00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:56.738
and my goal is to heal your mind

243
00:15:56.838 --> 00:15:59.974
and reintegrate you into
society as soon as possible.


244
00:16:00.073 --> 00:16:01.408
- As soon as possible.

245
00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:04.144
So how soon are we
talking about here?


246
00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.313
- I'll tell you this.

247
00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:09.584
I'm very good at what I do,

248
00:16:10.785 --> 00:16:12.286
and I've had pretty
tough customers


249
00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:14.956
in and out of here
in a year or two.


250
00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:19.393
But it really depends on you.

251
00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:22.697
If you work with me,
fully submit to my care


252
00:16:22.797 --> 00:16:26.199
and your treatments, then
everything should go smoothly.


253
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.468
- Yeah, I mean that's,
that's fine with me.


254
00:16:28.569 --> 00:16:30.404
I'll do whatever
it takes, you know?


255
00:16:30.504 --> 00:16:32.774
- Okay.
- Fix me up.


256
00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:34.408
- Follow me.

257
00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:36.711
- Fix me up.

258
00:16:47.087 --> 00:16:49.958
So uh, what's the game plan?

259
00:16:50.058 --> 00:16:51.859
- We'll run a few routine tests

260
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.862
and then we'll get you
settled into your room.


261
00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:57.632
(door creaking)

262
00:16:57.732 --> 00:17:00.233
- Hi Stephen.
Pleased to meet you.


263
00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:02.003
Have a seat.

264
00:17:02.102 --> 00:17:03.605
- All righty.

265
00:17:08.275 --> 00:17:10.510
- Facilities like ours
can have a bad rep,


266
00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:14.015
but as you can see, our
patients are very happy here.


267
00:17:14.114 --> 00:17:15.515
- Yeah, looked like it.

268
00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:19.486
- Okay, Stephen, if
you'll just lay back,


269
00:17:19.587 --> 00:17:20.855
close your eyes and relax.

270
00:17:20.955 --> 00:17:22.389
We'll get started.

271
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.360
- All right.

272
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.229
- Dr. Fielder knows how
special your case is.


273
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.734
This will be very good for you.

274
00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:35.937
(tense music)

275
00:17:36.037 --> 00:17:37.839
I need you to be
perfectly still.


276
00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:44.612
Just take a slow, deep breath.

277
00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:47.214
I'm gonna have Eliza
give you a sedative.


278
00:17:47.314 --> 00:17:49.083
Manny, Darius?
- A sedative?


279
00:17:49.182 --> 00:17:53.588
Wait--
- Please hold him still.


280
00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:56.724
- Excuse me.

281
00:17:56.824 --> 00:17:58.458
Wait.

282
00:17:59.594 --> 00:18:01.161
Is that really necessary, doc?

283
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:02.930
- Stay calm.
- Wait, wait, wait.


284
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.264
What? (laughing)

285
00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:05.900
No, please.

286
00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:08.136
Hey, wait, wait!

287
00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:09.436
No, please, please,
please, hey wait!


288
00:18:09.536 --> 00:18:11.839
Come on, come on,
please, no, no!


289
00:18:13.908 --> 00:18:16.844
(Stephen gasping)

290
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:21.749
- Is everything all
right, sweetheart?


291
00:18:21.849 --> 00:18:23.383
Was it just a nightmare?

292
00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:27.755
Nothing that a good dose
of sunshine can't cure.


293
00:18:29.991 --> 00:18:32.093
- Is this my room?

294
00:18:32.192 --> 00:18:34.394
- No silly. It's Jenny's.

295
00:18:37.832 --> 00:18:39.033
- She did these?

296
00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:40.902
- Your paintings?

297
00:18:41.002 --> 00:18:43.403
Are you messing with me?

298
00:18:43.503 --> 00:18:45.139
You know, you got
really good at this.


299
00:18:45.238 --> 00:18:46.273
I'm gonna be really sorry

300
00:18:46.373 --> 00:18:47.842
when you take it home with you.

301
00:18:47.942 --> 00:18:50.912
- Hey Stephen, I heard
you were leaving today.


302
00:18:52.512 --> 00:18:54.414
I'm really gonna miss you.

303
00:18:54.514 --> 00:18:56.249
- We all are.

304
00:18:56.984 --> 00:18:58.518
- Alright guys.

305
00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:01.254
Stephen and I need a
little bit of privacy.


306
00:19:02.023 --> 00:19:03.691
Please.

307
00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.627
Today's the big day,

308
00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:09.597
- Doctor, I'm a little confused.

309
00:19:09.697 --> 00:19:11.531
- You have a question,
I'm happy to answer it.


310
00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:14.969
But Alicia is on her way and
we have plenty of things--


311
00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:16.269
- Alicia, Alicia's what?

312
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:18.973
- She's coming to take you home.

313
00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:20.675
You've been a model patient.

314
00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:22.910
You're no longer a threat
to others or to yourself.


315
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.879
You're ready.

316
00:19:24.979 --> 00:19:27.682
- You said best case
scenario was a year.


317
00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:30.383
- I know, time flies when
you're having fun, but...


318
00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:31.953
- He's had a nightmare.

319
00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:34.622
He's been acting a little
strange ever since.


320
00:19:35.455 --> 00:19:36.824
- Keep taking your meds

321
00:19:36.924 --> 00:19:38.726
and the nightmares will
go away, I promise.


322
00:19:38.826 --> 00:19:41.394
And after 18 months inside,
a little bit of anxiety--


323
00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:43.030
- 18 months?

324
00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:47.367
- Are you okay, Stephen?

325
00:19:48.236 --> 00:19:50.337
(tense music)

326
00:19:50.437 --> 00:19:52.240
- Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:56.778
It's just, you know, being
here this whole time, I just,


328
00:19:56.878 --> 00:19:59.346
I never, I never thought
that this day would come.


329
00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:02.650
And now that it's here, just...

330
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.685
- I know exactly what you mean.

331
00:20:17.064 --> 00:20:20.134
(Alicia crying softly)

332
00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:21.669
- I missed you so much.

333
00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:25.239
- It's so good to see
you two back together.


334
00:20:25.338 --> 00:20:29.710
Just a few final things I need
to say in front of you both.


335
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:32.613
One pill a day, take
it with breakfast.


336
00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:35.850
And then again, anytime
you have an episode.


337
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.517
- An episode?

338
00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:39.452
- Yes, I know it's been a
while since your last one,


339
00:20:39.553 --> 00:20:40.955
but even if it's a bad headache

340
00:20:41.055 --> 00:20:43.891
or a nightmare, you can
never be too careful.


341
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:45.525
Understand?

342
00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:48.796
Let me see.

343
00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:51.531
There is a possibility
of memory loss.


344
00:20:51.632 --> 00:20:52.667
It should be temporary.

345
00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:54.534
If it persists, let me know.

346
00:20:54.635 --> 00:20:57.772
And also stay away from
any stressful situations.


347
00:20:57.872 --> 00:20:59.674
I know you're eager
to get back to work


348
00:20:59.774 --> 00:21:01.441
and to your old life,

349
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:03.711
but the more you can
help him ease into it,


350
00:21:03.811 --> 00:21:05.880
the smoother the
transition will go.


351
00:21:07.014 --> 00:21:09.317
Oh, and as a
condition of release,


352
00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:11.152
local PD will
probably check in on


353
00:21:11.252 --> 00:21:12.820
you every once in a while.

354
00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:16.090
- Got it.

355
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:18.391
- I'm proud of you.

356
00:21:19.927 --> 00:21:22.930
- Thanks doc.
(tense music)


357
00:21:44.685 --> 00:21:47.520
(tense music)

358
00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:03.070
Hey, Alicia.

359
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.705
Sign still work?

360
00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:07.642
- Only one way to find out.

361
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:17.752
(dogs barking)

362
00:22:24.325 --> 00:22:27.194
(bell on door rings)

363
00:22:30.331 --> 00:22:34.434
I've been fixing to clean
this place up, but you know,


364
00:22:34.534 --> 00:22:39.840
after you went away, it was
hard for me to step foot in here


365
00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:41.709
and then things got
real busy at the salon


366
00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:44.378
and I, I just never...

367
00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:46.579
- Oh, I got plenty
of time to clean.


368
00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:51.953
(dog barking)

369
00:22:56.556 --> 00:22:58.525
Huh, Guess it's not working.

370
00:22:58.626 --> 00:22:59.994
You change the bulbs?

371
00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:03.798
- You think I changed the bulbs?

372
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:06.834
Come on.

373
00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:19.714
(radio playing music)

374
00:23:21.816 --> 00:23:24.585
Baby, dinner's ready.

375
00:23:32.525 --> 00:23:33.794
Stephen.

376
00:23:33.894 --> 00:23:35.863
Come on, it's ready.

377
00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:40.267
I took a peek of your paintings
while you were showering.


378
00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:42.003
I probably should have
asked before hanging 'em up.


379
00:23:42.103 --> 00:23:44.504
I'm sorry, but I just
thought it might help


380
00:23:44.605 --> 00:23:46.040
ease your transition.

381
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.309
It's really
beautiful work, baby.


382
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:51.145
Really beautiful work.

383
00:23:51.245 --> 00:23:54.949
- They say I painted them,
but I don't remember doing it.


384
00:23:55.049 --> 00:23:57.517
I don't remember
picking up a brush.


385
00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:00.121
Like not once in my life.

386
00:24:02.723 --> 00:24:04.725
- Well, you know, you
heard Dr. Fielder.


387
00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:06.727
She said this might happen, so.

388
00:24:08.262 --> 00:24:09.930
But if you want,

389
00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:12.266
we can go see the doctor first
thing tomorrow morning and--


390
00:24:12.366 --> 00:24:13.667
- Oh no, I'm not--

391
00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:14.769
- Get to the bottom
of everything.


392
00:24:14.869 --> 00:24:16.070
- I'm not going back there.

393
00:24:18.339 --> 00:24:19.340
- Come on, baby.

394
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.075
Don't talk like that.

395
00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:22.610
- Talk like what?

396
00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:29.950
(indistinct)

397
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:34.989
- Folks who get sent
away like you did,


398
00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:40.661
they spend 20 to 30 years
inside, sometimes more.


399
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:43.264
And when I heard that,
I swear to God, Stephen,


400
00:24:43.364 --> 00:24:45.666
I didn't even know
if I could go on.


401
00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:48.102
- Yeah.

402
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:55.943
- Listen, from here on out,

403
00:24:56.043 --> 00:24:58.979
I'm gonna say we just
forget about the past.


404
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.416
Let's try and just
live in the moment.


405
00:25:02.516 --> 00:25:03.451
- Yeah.

406
00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:05.319
- Focus on our future.

407
00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:09.590
Because that's all
that matters now.


408
00:25:11.692 --> 00:25:14.595
(mellow music)

409
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:22.870
(soft music)

410
00:25:27.842 --> 00:25:33.047
(birds chirping)
(dogs barking)


411
00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:40.254
Some OJ to wash it down?

412
00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:42.957
- I'm not taking anything
until I get my memories back.


413
00:25:43.057 --> 00:25:45.659
- But Dr. Fielder said
one every morning.


414
00:25:46.527 --> 00:25:47.761
- I slept like a baby.

415
00:25:47.862 --> 00:25:50.731
No nightmares. I'm fine.

416
00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:51.999
- Quitting cold turkey, Stephen,

417
00:25:52.099 --> 00:25:53.467
it could affect your behavior.

418
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.202
I mean, like what if something--

419
00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:57.938
- I promise you if my behavior
changes, if I do anything


420
00:25:58.038 --> 00:26:01.742
that gives you reason for
concern, just say the word


421
00:26:01.842 --> 00:26:03.644
and I'll take the pills.

422
00:26:09.584 --> 00:26:11.185
- So what you gonna do today?

423
00:26:11.785 --> 00:26:12.853
- I don't know.

424
00:26:12.953 --> 00:26:14.822
I want to get back to normal.

425
00:26:14.922 --> 00:26:16.157
I wanna go back to work.

426
00:26:16.257 --> 00:26:17.057
- Work?

427
00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:18.192
- Yeah. Open up the store.

428
00:26:18.292 --> 00:26:19.628
- Mm-mm, nope.

429
00:26:19.727 --> 00:26:22.963
- Listen, nothing
could relax me more.


430
00:26:23.063 --> 00:26:24.798
Come on babe. You know that.

431
00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:27.434
Come on.

432
00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:33.007
- Well, hell, get
her done, I guess.


433
00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:34.708
- Yes.

434
00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:36.443
- Well, there are conditions.

435
00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:37.745
I mean, you know,

436
00:26:37.845 --> 00:26:38.946
you're gonna have
to start small.


437
00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:40.681
- Right.
- Keep reasonable hours.


438
00:26:40.781 --> 00:26:41.815
No pressure.

439
00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:42.917
And if it starts getting to you,

440
00:26:43.017 --> 00:26:44.952
Stephen, we shut her down.

441
00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:46.720
(lively music)

442
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:52.059
(man singing)

443
00:27:22.523 --> 00:27:25.326
(birds calling)

444
00:27:36.503 --> 00:27:39.306
(pail creaking)

445
00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:45.980
(brush scrubbing)

446
00:27:53.887 --> 00:27:55.456
- Damn it!

447
00:28:05.366 --> 00:28:08.002
(tense music)

448
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:19.847
(engines roaring)

449
00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:29.456
(button beeping)

450
00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:32.026
- [Lester] Stephen, come
on out, (indistinct).


451
00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:41.402
- Lester.

452
00:28:41.502 --> 00:28:43.103
You know, I hate to ask,

453
00:28:43.203 --> 00:28:44.938
but is there any chance we
could settle up a little later?


454
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.675
I just shelled out for supplies

455
00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:48.710
and little low on
funds right now.


456
00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:50.444
- How long we've been friends?

457
00:28:53.847 --> 00:28:55.482
- I honestly can't
even remember.


458
00:28:55.583 --> 00:28:57.318
- Well, that's right now.

459
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.120
You can take as
long as you need.


460
00:29:01.623 --> 00:29:04.825
(engines rumbling)

461
00:29:19.573 --> 00:29:21.041
You know them boys?
(tense music)


462
00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:22.543
- I don't think so.

463
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.212
No.

464
00:29:25.312 --> 00:29:28.115
- They sure seem to know you.

465
00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:32.252
(engines continue rumbling)

466
00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:42.863
(glass clinking)

467
00:29:42.963 --> 00:29:46.500
- Hey you, who was
supposed to be relaxing?


468
00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:49.870
- No, it is.

469
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.573
I just...

470
00:29:52.674 --> 00:29:56.577
I just got this awful feeling
like something's not right.


471
00:29:56.678 --> 00:29:59.146
- I think I might have
an answer for you.


472
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.685
I called Dr. Fielder today.

473
00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:04.819
- You did what?
- It's okay.


474
00:30:04.918 --> 00:30:06.053
I didn't tell her anything.

475
00:30:06.153 --> 00:30:08.623
I was just worried, so...

476
00:30:10.725 --> 00:30:12.126
- What'd she say?

477
00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:15.295
- She said that memory
loss is not uncommon


478
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:21.301
in people with your condition,
especially when combined


479
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:23.036
with post-traumatic stress.

480
00:30:23.904 --> 00:30:26.974
Well there is no doubt, Stephen,

481
00:30:27.074 --> 00:30:30.043
past 18 months have
been traumatic for you.


482
00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:34.181
For us.

483
00:30:34.281 --> 00:30:36.250
- Yeah. Makes sense.

484
00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:46.126
- Broom away, huh?

485
00:30:50.397 --> 00:30:52.299
You're mine for the
rest of the night.


486
00:30:56.403 --> 00:30:57.971
(Stephen clearing throat)

487
00:31:01.643 --> 00:31:03.878
(sign buzzing)

488
00:31:03.977 --> 00:31:08.583
(indistinct voice
speaking on radio)


489
00:31:15.155 --> 00:31:18.358
(engines rumbling)

490
00:31:30.337 --> 00:31:32.774
- You guys in the
market for a fill up?


491
00:31:32.874 --> 00:31:35.610
- What do you say, Laszlo,
you running on empty?


492
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:40.514
- Junior, fill 'em
up, all of them.


493
00:31:45.052 --> 00:31:46.086
- You know, there's
really no need.


494
00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:48.222
This is a full service station.

495
00:31:48.322 --> 00:31:52.627
Ah!
(dramatic music)


496
00:31:52.727 --> 00:31:54.328
(Stephen gasping)

497
00:31:54.428 --> 00:31:56.997
- You really thought you
could hide from us here?


498
00:31:57.097 --> 00:31:58.733
- There must be a mistake.

499
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:02.269
(grunts) I think you
got the wrong guy.


500
00:32:02.369 --> 00:32:05.874
- No, Stephen, I have
exactly the right guy.


501
00:32:05.974 --> 00:32:08.208
Now where's my money?

502
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.646
Are you hard of hearing?

503
00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:15.415
- Please, all I got
is in the register.


504
00:32:17.084 --> 00:32:18.987
- Open it.

505
00:32:19.086 --> 00:32:21.723
(tense music)

506
00:32:29.463 --> 00:32:31.231
- I just reopened the
store a couple days ago.


507
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:32.901
That's all I got.

508
00:32:33.001 --> 00:32:37.839
- Do you think we came all
this way for a few bucks?


509
00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:39.106
- I don't know why you came
here. What'd you expect?


510
00:32:39.206 --> 00:32:41.709
(Stephen grunting)

511
00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:43.277
- You took what's ours.

512
00:32:43.377 --> 00:32:44.746
You think I'd forget?

513
00:32:44.846 --> 00:32:47.916
That it'd all be water
under the bridge?


514
00:32:48.016 --> 00:32:49.349
- No. No way.

515
00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:51.051
I mean, there's, you
got the wrong guy.


516
00:32:51.151 --> 00:32:52.452
I mean--

517
00:32:52.553 --> 00:32:56.123
(Stephen grunting)
(shelf clattering)


518
00:32:56.223 --> 00:32:57.759
- Give up the cash.

519
00:32:57.859 --> 00:33:00.762
- There's no more, I swear,
I'm telling the truth.


520
00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:02.229
There's no more money.

521
00:33:04.197 --> 00:33:06.199
- We'll just see about that.

522
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.568
- Toss the place.

523
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:13.073
(men whooping)
(dramatic music)


524
00:33:22.951 --> 00:33:25.920
(music continues)

525
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.287
- No!

526
00:33:27.387 --> 00:33:30.592
(glass shattering)

527
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:37.665
(Stephen grunting)

528
00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:40.567
(man whistling)

529
00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:41.836
- We'll be back.

530
00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:43.705
And if you want me
to keep my hands off


531
00:33:43.805 --> 00:33:47.842
that tasty little wife of
yours, you better have my money.


532
00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:51.144
(Stephen grunting)

533
00:33:51.244 --> 00:33:52.614
- You need this pill.

534
00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:55.282
You know you do.

535
00:33:55.382 --> 00:33:56.751
I don't want anything
to happen to you.


536
00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:58.552
You need this pill.

537
00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:07.595
(Stephen grunting)
(tense music)


538
00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:16.704
- Darling?

539
00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:20.207
- Are you all right?
- (grunts) I'll live.


540
00:34:20.307 --> 00:34:21.876
- Did I call you?

541
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.276
- Of course you did.

542
00:34:23.377 --> 00:34:25.013
But it don't make
it lick of sense.


543
00:34:25.113 --> 00:34:26.981
I mean, you ain't got a
violent bone in your body.


544
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:28.716
Who would do this to you?

545
00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:30.150
- Bikers.

546
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.518
- But why? I mean...

547
00:34:31.619 --> 00:34:32.820
- Money.

548
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.287
- You tell 'em we don't
got a pot to piss in?


549
00:34:34.388 --> 00:34:35.455
- They don't care.

550
00:34:35.555 --> 00:34:37.592
They think I'm somebody else.

551
00:34:37.692 --> 00:34:39.827
- Well, listen, we
need to call the police


552
00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:41.261
and Stephen from now on,

553
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:43.163
you carry my
sweetheart with you.


554
00:34:43.263 --> 00:34:45.700
- No, no, no cops, no guns.

555
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.868
Not yet.

556
00:34:46.968 --> 00:34:48.603
Let's just go see the damage.

557
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.840
(tense music)

558
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.575
(door chimes)

559
00:34:57.444 --> 00:34:59.647
- No, I don't...

560
00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:02.750
Someone's messing with me.

561
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.752
No, this they tore
this whole place apart.


562
00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:08.188
I mean, they took the
cash out of the register


563
00:35:08.288 --> 00:35:10.457
and tossed it right
through the window.


564
00:35:10.557 --> 00:35:13.995
- Baby Stephen, this
has just been a lot.


565
00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:15.195
- No, no, no.

566
00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:16.196
There's somebody
messing with me.


567
00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:17.497
- No, Stephen, come on.

568
00:35:17.598 --> 00:35:19.133
- Why don't you believe me?

569
00:35:19.232 --> 00:35:20.267
- Baby, I'm sorry.

570
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:21.769
No, but that dog won't hunt.

571
00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.605
The store, it's fine.

572
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.239
You're fine.

573
00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:31.145
You just had an episode.

574
00:35:31.244 --> 00:35:32.245
- [Stephen] An episode.

575
00:35:32.345 --> 00:35:34.048
- Yeah. That's all it was.

576
00:35:34.148 --> 00:35:36.684
- I mean, I mean...

577
00:35:36.784 --> 00:35:39.386
- Baby, come on
just, just close up


578
00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:40.888
and let's just get inside.

579
00:35:44.424 --> 00:35:47.662
(crickets chirping)

580
00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:54.135
Baby, I think it's
time we go talk


581
00:35:54.234 --> 00:35:57.504
to Dr. Fielder and
we should see..


582
00:35:57.605 --> 00:36:00.708
- I took a pill just
before you got home.


583
00:36:00.808 --> 00:36:01.943
I'm fine.

584
00:36:02.043 --> 00:36:03.144
I'll take another
one in the morning.


585
00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:05.412
I'm fine. I promise.

586
00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:12.552
- Okay.

587
00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:17.825
Baby, just try to
get some rest in.


588
00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:23.631
(Stephen sighs)

589
00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:32.907
(drill whirring)

590
00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:36.210
- What are you doing,
what's going on?


591
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:38.946
Please stop, somebody help me!

592
00:36:43.483 --> 00:36:45.552
- Baby, darling,
shh, what's wrong?


593
00:36:45.653 --> 00:36:47.822
- I'm starting to
remember what happened,


594
00:36:47.922 --> 00:36:48.956
what they did to me.

595
00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:49.957
- Wait, what?

596
00:36:50.057 --> 00:36:51.259
What who did to you?

597
00:36:51.358 --> 00:36:54.262
- They implanted
a port in my head.


598
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:55.428
A chip or something?

599
00:36:55.529 --> 00:36:56.664
- A port?

600
00:36:56.764 --> 00:36:57.965
- I only saw it for a second.

601
00:36:58.065 --> 00:36:59.667
It should be right there.

602
00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:01.334
- I don't see anything. No.

603
00:37:01.434 --> 00:37:02.170
What?

604
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.171
- No marks?

605
00:37:03.271 --> 00:37:04.172
- No.

606
00:37:04.272 --> 00:37:06.174
Baby, please, stop.

607
00:37:06.274 --> 00:37:08.910
(tense music)

608
00:37:10.978 --> 00:37:12.613
- No.

609
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.387
(footsteps approaching)

610
00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:25.626
- What are you working on?

611
00:37:25.726 --> 00:37:27.061
- I want to get
details down from


612
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:28.763
last night so I don't forget.

613
00:37:29.997 --> 00:37:32.266
- Nightmare isn't the
same as your memory.


614
00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:34.068
- These, these are memories.

615
00:37:34.168 --> 00:37:35.970
These are things that actually
happened that they did to me.


616
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.470
It's all coming back

617
00:37:41.642 --> 00:37:45.345
- Yesterday you were convinced
a biker gang came in,


618
00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:47.748
beat you up and
looted your store.


619
00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:53.588
Baby, please, I'm
worried about you.


620
00:37:54.622 --> 00:37:56.958
I think you should
take your pills.


621
00:37:57.058 --> 00:37:59.492
I think it's gonna
make you feel better.


622
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.296
Come on, baby.

623
00:38:02.395 --> 00:38:03.865
You need these pills.

624
00:38:04.497 --> 00:38:06.000
I know you do.

625
00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:09.469
I don't want anything
to happen to you.


626
00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:15.076
I love you.
(tense music)


627
00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.576
- What did you say?

628
00:38:18.378 --> 00:38:20.882
- I said I love you.

629
00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:22.382
- You've been talking to
Fielder again, haven't you?


630
00:38:22.482 --> 00:38:23.885
- What? No.

631
00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:25.552
- What, "you need this
pill, I know you do.


632
00:38:25.653 --> 00:38:26.654
"I don't want anything
to happen to you."


633
00:38:26.754 --> 00:38:28.055
She told you to say that.

634
00:38:28.155 --> 00:38:29.891
Those are her exact words.

635
00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:32.193
Her people's--
- Those are my words.


636
00:38:32.293 --> 00:38:34.061
Take the pill, get better.

637
00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:35.196
What's wrong with you?

638
00:38:35.296 --> 00:38:36.563
- Just please be honest with me.

639
00:38:36.664 --> 00:38:38.332
- I've never not
been honest with you.


640
00:38:38.431 --> 00:38:39.800
Actually, that's not true.

641
00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:42.103
I have been holding
something back.


642
00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:45.206
Bless your heart, but
you've been acting strange


643
00:38:45.306 --> 00:38:47.608
as all get out since
you left the hospital.


644
00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:49.076
Well, now you're
having full blown,


645
00:38:49.176 --> 00:38:51.112
paranoid delusions
and that is not okay.


646
00:38:51.212 --> 00:38:54.315
You think about how hard
all this has been on me.


647
00:38:54.414 --> 00:38:57.952
I'm here. I'm still
standing by you.


648
00:38:58.052 --> 00:39:01.956
But I can't help you if
you don't wanna be helped.


649
00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:05.293
You promised me
you'd take the pills.


650
00:39:05.393 --> 00:39:08.095
So pretty please
with sugar on top,


651
00:39:08.195 --> 00:39:09.597
take the damn thing.

652
00:39:11.032 --> 00:39:13.668
(tense music)

653
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:41.595
- Now, it wasn't
so hard, was it?


654
00:39:54.574 --> 00:39:57.211
(tense music)

655
00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:15.463
(tense music continues)

656
00:40:15.562 --> 00:40:16.797
- [Alicia] Toby, come on!

657
00:40:16.897 --> 00:40:17.765
(Stephen screaming)

658
00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:19.532
- [Stephen] Fuck!

659
00:40:21.501 --> 00:40:23.804
(tense music)

660
00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:28.175
(mellow music playing on radio)

661
00:40:29.043 --> 00:40:31.679
(tense music)

662
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:42.890
(tense music continues)

663
00:40:51.298 --> 00:40:53.701
- Stephen?

664
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:56.504
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to give you a start.


665
00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:57.972
- All good.

666
00:40:58.072 --> 00:41:01.541
I just got a little too
caught up in my reading.


667
00:41:02.243 --> 00:41:03.811
- Alright.

668
00:41:10.684 --> 00:41:12.953
I didn't know you were
such a fine artist.


669
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:17.892
- Yeah, I painted
that while I was away.


670
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.027
Apparently that,
that, that's Alicia.


671
00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:23.563
She and her mom used to go
down to Mexico every summer.


672
00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:26.801
She's always talking about
how she wants to go back down.


673
00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:28.369
- You've never been?
- No.


674
00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:31.839
Once things get settled
here, I'm gonna take her.


675
00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:34.975
But that'll have to do for now.

676
00:41:36.811 --> 00:41:37.912
(soft music)

677
00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:40.414
- That's a wonderful idea.

678
00:41:40.514 --> 00:41:42.083
I think she's going to love it.

679
00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:47.288
(tense music)

680
00:41:47.388 --> 00:41:50.591
(engines rumbling)

681
00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:53.928
- Go, out the back now.

682
00:41:54.028 --> 00:41:55.996
- If you're in some kind of
trouble, I got your back now.


683
00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:57.565
- Just please, I have
to handle this myself.


684
00:41:57.665 --> 00:41:58.632
Okay? Please.

685
00:41:58.732 --> 00:41:59.967
- You sure?
- Yeah.


686
00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:01.635
- Alright.

687
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:09.110
- Smart of you not to run again.

688
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.779
Not that it'd of
done you any good.


689
00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:13.481
You got my money?

690
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:15.716
- Okay, so you can have
whatever's in the register.


691
00:42:15.816 --> 00:42:18.285
I am not the guy
that you think I am.


692
00:42:18.385 --> 00:42:19.420
(door opening)

693
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.323
- Alright, you devils, get out.

694
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.191
(tense music)

695
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.359
- Just please--

696
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:27.361
(shot firing)

697
00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:30.397
(bikers laughing)

698
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:35.002
(tense music)

699
00:42:35.102 --> 00:42:36.337
He's dead.

700
00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:37.872
- So is my brother.

701
00:42:38.772 --> 00:42:40.141
Fair is fair.

702
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:43.210
You kill someone I love,
I kill someone you love.


703
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:47.982
Get me the money and I
might just call it even.


704
00:42:51.118 --> 00:42:53.354
Maybe we need to
go to the house.


705
00:42:53.454 --> 00:42:57.024
Have a talk with your
sexy little lady.


706
00:42:57.124 --> 00:42:58.659
I have a feeling she
may be more helpful.


707
00:42:58.759 --> 00:42:59.827
- No, don't!

708
00:42:59.927 --> 00:43:02.631
(Stephen grunting)

709
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.098
(bikers laughing)

710
00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:07.568
- Okay, I'm gonna make
you a final offer.


711
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:10.605
You get me the money and you
and the girl can get rid of us


712
00:43:10.704 --> 00:43:15.276
or we can wreck the whole place.

713
00:43:18.613 --> 00:43:20.781
(shot firing)

714
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:24.051
(Stephen laughing)

715
00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:28.255
Did I say something funny?

716
00:43:29.924 --> 00:43:33.127
(Stephen laughing)

717
00:43:35.162 --> 00:43:36.830
You're crazy, is that it?

718
00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.967
- Oh, you're right. I am crazy.

719
00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:42.469
Which means that
you're not real.


720
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.238
You don't exist.

721
00:43:44.338 --> 00:43:47.708
You're just a
fantasy, a nightmare.


722
00:43:47.808 --> 00:43:51.111
A delusion. (laughing)

723
00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:56.217
My crazy pills.

724
00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:01.822
- I am going to enjoy
blowing your head off.


725
00:44:03.424 --> 00:44:04.358
(voices overlapping)

726
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:05.359
(shot firing)

727
00:44:05.459 --> 00:44:06.360
- Stephen, Stephen!

728
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.795
This is ridiculous.

729
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.563
Baby, listen to me.

730
00:44:09.664 --> 00:44:11.031
Come here.
(thunder rolling)


731
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:12.667
I'm cold, it's late.
What are we doing here?


732
00:44:12.766 --> 00:44:14.134
- We're alive, right?

733
00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:16.203
This is now?

734
00:44:16.303 --> 00:44:18.439
Baby, you're not
making any sense.


735
00:44:18.539 --> 00:44:21.442
- They did something
to me back there, baby.


736
00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:24.445
Something really bad.

737
00:44:24.545 --> 00:44:27.514
I'm starting to feel like I'm
caught between then and now.


738
00:44:27.616 --> 00:44:28.683
Everything's all mixed up.

739
00:44:28.782 --> 00:44:30.918
It's all just happening at once.

740
00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:33.655
It's like I'm here,
but I'm not here.


741
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:35.055
- Stop.
- It's coming. It's going.


742
00:44:35.155 --> 00:44:36.790
- You're really scaring me here!

743
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.159
Please just stop. Okay?

744
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.095
We cannot go on like this.

745
00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:43.130
You need to start
taking your pills.


746
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.032
(thunder rolling)
Alright? Please baby.


747
00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:47.001
Can we just get inside, baby?

748
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.603
Can we just get inside?

749
00:44:48.703 --> 00:44:50.304
There is a storm coming.

750
00:44:50.404 --> 00:44:51.338
Honestly.

751
00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:52.840
- Why'd you say that?

752
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.842
Why'd you say that?

753
00:44:57.311 --> 00:45:02.783
(Stephen grunting)
(heart pounding)


754
00:45:10.557 --> 00:45:12.059
- I love you.

755
00:45:18.899 --> 00:45:24.171
(dramatic music)
(Stephen gasping)


756
00:45:36.116 --> 00:45:40.154
(indistinct voices shouting)

757
00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:48.395
- [Man] Now, (indistinct)!

758
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:56.337
- [Alicia] Toby, come on!

759
00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:08.515
(Laszlo shouting)

760
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.388
- God we found it
before anyone noticed.


761
00:46:16.156 --> 00:46:18.325
And since we're
already down here,


762
00:46:18.425 --> 00:46:21.796
there's a bed in room 114
that needs some attention.


763
00:46:21.895 --> 00:46:23.931
I could use a hand.

764
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:26.300
- Alright, let's just go then.

765
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:33.040
(nurse chuckling)
(machines beeping)


766
00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.643
(tense music)

767
00:46:41.649 --> 00:46:44.586
(machine beeping)

768
00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:52.292
(dramatic music)
(Stephen panting)


769
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:54.194
- It's okay.

770
00:46:54.294 --> 00:46:57.766
You don't have a bad
bone in your body.


771
00:46:57.866 --> 00:47:00.033
You can never hurt
another person.


772
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.503
You couldn't even hurt a fly.

773
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:15.048
(music continues)
(Stephen retching)


774
00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.253
(water running)

775
00:47:24.692 --> 00:47:26.226
- Wake up, baby.

776
00:47:30.497 --> 00:47:32.466
(dramatic music)

777
00:47:32.566 --> 00:47:35.202
(indistinct)

778
00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:38.071
- Stephen!

779
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:45.613
Wake up, Stephen!

780
00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:48.683
(both panting)

781
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:51.552
- No, please.

782
00:47:51.653 --> 00:47:52.587
Don't.

783
00:47:52.687 --> 00:47:56.423
(alarm blaring)

784
00:47:56.523 --> 00:47:58.559
- Come on Kathy. What'd
you go and do that for?


785
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.194
- One of them got out!

786
00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:02.996
He's over there, I'm scared!

787
00:48:05.065 --> 00:48:10.337
(dramatic music)
(alarm blaring)


788
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.283
(music continues)

789
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.596
- Call Dr. Fielder, now.

790
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.169
(Stephen panting)

791
00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:44.873
- Where am I, who
are you people?


792
00:48:44.973 --> 00:48:46.808
What do you want with me? Huh?

793
00:48:46.908 --> 00:48:47.775
- Hey. Hey.

794
00:48:47.876 --> 00:48:49.042
Take it easy, man.

795
00:48:49.142 --> 00:48:50.377
We're not here to hurt you.

796
00:48:50.477 --> 00:48:51.679
We'll take you to the doctor.

797
00:48:51.779 --> 00:48:53.280
She'll explain everything.

798
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:56.618
Don't worry. Okay?

799
00:48:56.718 --> 00:48:57.819
Easy.

800
00:48:57.919 --> 00:49:00.622
(all grunting)

801
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.597
(Stephen screaming)

802
00:49:16.169 --> 00:49:19.273
(Stephen panting)

803
00:49:25.613 --> 00:49:27.381
- We're doing
groundbreaking work here.


804
00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:29.817
Out of context, our
methods may seem mysterious


805
00:49:29.918 --> 00:49:32.185
or even frightening,

806
00:49:32.286 --> 00:49:34.521
but it's all in the
name of rehabilitation.


807
00:49:34.622 --> 00:49:37.759
- That's an awful fancy
way to describe torture.


808
00:49:39.928 --> 00:49:41.495
- Let's not be dramatic.

809
00:49:41.596 --> 00:49:43.831
We simply put you in
a pleasant dream state


810
00:49:43.932 --> 00:49:45.065
that allows us to continues--

811
00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:46.935
- A pleasant dream state

812
00:49:47.035 --> 00:49:49.069
where a biker gang
loots my store


813
00:49:49.169 --> 00:49:50.705
and kills me and my friend.

814
00:49:50.805 --> 00:49:53.407
- Simply elements
of your subconscious


815
00:49:53.507 --> 00:49:55.576
kicking their weight
into prominence.


816
00:49:55.677 --> 00:49:57.912
You have a strong
stubborn mind, Stephen.


817
00:49:58.012 --> 00:49:59.479
It doesn't want to let go.

818
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.749
It's trying to force
you to remember things.


819
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:04.117
Things that we're trying
to help you move past.


820
00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:05.753
- Bullshit.

821
00:50:05.853 --> 00:50:07.321
I don't know those guys.

822
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:09.289
I don't owe them any money

823
00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:11.525
and I certainly
didn't kill anybody.


824
00:50:11.626 --> 00:50:13.226
I want to talk to my lawyer.

825
00:50:13.327 --> 00:50:14.796
She knows I'm innocent,
that I got a raw deal.


826
00:50:14.896 --> 00:50:15.930
Let's give her a call.

827
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.632
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

828
00:50:17.732 --> 00:50:19.433
- That's my right.

829
00:50:21.636 --> 00:50:24.204
- You need to stop
fighting your treatment.


830
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:29.611
- This is bullshit!

831
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.949
(device whirring)
(Stephen screaming)


832
00:50:35.049 --> 00:50:37.085
- Stephen, come on, we gotta
go, we can't stay here!


833
00:50:37.184 --> 00:50:40.021
Wake up. Come on, come on.

834
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.989
We have to go.

835
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.990
- What's going on?

836
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.890
- Baby, we gotta go.

837
00:50:42.991 --> 00:50:44.424
Come on, move.

838
00:50:45.492 --> 00:50:46.259
- What's going on?

839
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.294
- We have to go.

840
00:50:47.394 --> 00:50:48.128
Come on. Come on baby.

841
00:50:48.228 --> 00:50:48.997
We gotta--

842
00:50:49.097 --> 00:50:51.799
(dramatic music)

843
00:50:55.036 --> 00:50:58.171
(thunder crashes)

844
00:51:02.844 --> 00:51:05.847
(ceiling crashing)

845
00:51:13.353 --> 00:51:16.924
- Alicia, Alicia,
Alicia, Alicia!


846
00:51:17.025 --> 00:51:18.726
(Alicia gasping)

847
00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:20.427
- Oh no, oh no...

848
00:51:24.866 --> 00:51:27.101
- Oh please, please!

849
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.038
(Stephen screaming)

850
00:51:30.138 --> 00:51:32.707
Come on, Alicia!

851
00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:36.878
No, no! (crying)

852
00:51:36.978 --> 00:51:39.647
(solemn music)

853
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.756
(Stephen panting)

854
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:57.765
(music continues)

855
00:52:02.904 --> 00:52:05.472
(indistinct)

856
00:52:07.274 --> 00:52:11.079
(Stephen panting)

857
00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:12.714
- Yeah. Thanks for coming by.

858
00:52:12.814 --> 00:52:16.918
I'll let you know if
anything changes, all right.


859
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.992
(engine starting)

860
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:29.997
(gravel crunching)

861
00:52:30.098 --> 00:52:31.599
- Alicia!

862
00:52:31.699 --> 00:52:33.266
- Darling?

863
00:52:34.334 --> 00:52:35.469
- I love you baby.

864
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:37.672
Oh, I love you so much.

865
00:52:37.772 --> 00:52:39.372
- God, darling. 
What on earth?

866
00:52:39.473 --> 00:52:40.875
You're soaked!

867
00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:42.375
- I heard you talking
to that cop and I just--


868
00:52:42.476 --> 00:52:44.478
- Calm down, baby.
Just calm down.


869
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:45.880
The officer just came
to check up on you,


870
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.049
just like Dr. Fielder
said he would.


871
00:52:48.149 --> 00:52:50.618
Baby, where were you?

872
00:52:50.718 --> 00:52:53.955
- I had a nightmare. A bad one.

873
00:52:54.055 --> 00:52:54.956
It was so real.

874
00:52:55.056 --> 00:52:56.323
It felt so real.

875
00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:57.424
So I took a pill.

876
00:52:57.524 --> 00:52:58.926
I swear to God. I did.

877
00:52:59.026 --> 00:53:01.394
I was worried that
I lost you for good.


878
00:53:01.495 --> 00:53:02.997
- It's okay, baby. Come on.

879
00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:04.431
You know you couldn't
lose me even if you tried.


880
00:53:04.531 --> 00:53:06.033
Let's just get you dried

881
00:53:06.134 --> 00:53:09.971
and then I'm gonna need
you to take a few days off.


882
00:53:10.071 --> 00:53:11.105
- What?

883
00:53:11.205 --> 00:53:12.640
What do you mean?

884
00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:15.777
- I have an idea.

885
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.982
(Alicia humming)

886
00:53:21.082 --> 00:53:22.116
It'll all come back to you.

887
00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:23.785
Just like riding a bicycle.

888
00:53:23.885 --> 00:53:25.452
All right.

889
00:53:28.689 --> 00:53:31.692
I'll just leave you to it, then.

890
00:53:45.572 --> 00:53:46.774
(tense music)

891
00:53:46.874 --> 00:53:51.145
(dramatic music)
(Stephen gasping)


892
00:53:51.245 --> 00:53:55.750
- I'm not giving up on
you, Stephen, I need you.


893
00:53:58.485 --> 00:53:59.821
- [Stephen] What a surprise.

894
00:53:59.921 --> 00:54:02.890
- It's good to see
you painting again.


895
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.092
- You've got
excellent timing, doc.


896
00:54:05.193 --> 00:54:06.894
Come see.

897
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:08.196
What do you think?

898
00:54:08.296 --> 00:54:09.329
- Hmm?

899
00:54:09.429 --> 00:54:11.232
- Alicia told me everything.

900
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:13.868
She's very concerned
and so am I.


901
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:17.305
Let's have a little chat.

902
00:54:17.437 --> 00:54:19.273
- Oh yeah, I'd love to.

903
00:54:19.372 --> 00:54:20.741
Let me clean up a bit.

904
00:54:30.952 --> 00:54:33.588
(tense music)

905
00:54:42.763 --> 00:54:46.000
(Stephen whistling)

906
00:54:49.604 --> 00:54:52.439
(gun cocking)

907
00:54:59.313 --> 00:55:01.816
(mellow music)

908
00:55:01.916 --> 00:55:04.285
- There's a simple
solution to your problem.


909
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:07.121
- Okay, let's cut the shit.

910
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:10.423
Maybe I'm sick, maybe I'm not.

911
00:55:10.523 --> 00:55:13.928
But I know that all this
is not what it seems


912
00:55:14.028 --> 00:55:16.030
I've seen behind
the curtain. Okay?


913
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.766
- Your hallucinations
have you confused.


914
00:55:18.866 --> 00:55:20.567
You're mistaking
dreams for memories.


915
00:55:20.668 --> 00:55:22.303
- These aren't dreams. Okay?

916
00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:23.905
I mean, I don't know,

917
00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:26.539
maybe it's a sick
experiment or something.


918
00:55:27.375 --> 00:55:29.010
- Again, your mind is trying

919
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.312
to create a story
that makes sense.


920
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:32.412
A story that you're a victim

921
00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:33.648
in some larger conspiracy.

922
00:55:33.748 --> 00:55:34.749
But I can assure you--

923
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:36.217
- Take me to the hospital.

924
00:55:36.317 --> 00:55:37.985
- What?

925
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:40.254
- I need to know, I want to
know exactly what's going on.


926
00:55:40.354 --> 00:55:41.722
I wanna see where I was cured.

927
00:55:41.822 --> 00:55:44.191
I wanna talk to people
who cared for me.


928
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:48.129
No, I don't want to
take any more of these.


929
00:55:48.229 --> 00:55:49.664
Please. That just doesn't help.

930
00:55:49.764 --> 00:55:50.530
It makes it worse.

931
00:55:50.631 --> 00:55:52.532
- You're wrong.

932
00:55:52.633 --> 00:55:54.035
You need this pill.

933
00:55:55.636 --> 00:55:58.039
(tense music)

934
00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:00.241
Fine.

935
00:56:00.341 --> 00:56:03.177
You do this for me and I'll
take you to the hospital.


936
00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:10.751
- You take me to the hospital.

937
00:56:12.519 --> 00:56:14.088
All right.

938
00:56:19.393 --> 00:56:20.928
- Very good.

939
00:56:27.902 --> 00:56:33.107
(tense music)
(fountains trickling)


940
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.987
(music continues)

941
00:56:50.057 --> 00:56:51.959
- Stephen.

942
00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:55.162
So good to see
you, are you okay?


943
00:56:55.262 --> 00:56:56.664
- Yes, Eliza, everything's fine.

944
00:56:56.764 --> 00:56:58.132
He just wanted to say hello.

945
00:56:58.232 --> 00:57:00.768
Isn't that right, Stephen?

946
00:57:00.868 --> 00:57:04.472
- Stephen, oh my God,
I missed you so much.


947
00:57:04.605 --> 00:57:06.506
I didn't think I'd
ever see you again.


948
00:57:06.607 --> 00:57:08.575
Did you ever make
it down to Mexico?


949
00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:10.044
- That's enough, Jenny.

950
00:57:10.144 --> 00:57:12.847
Stephen and I have
a matter to discuss.


951
00:57:15.449 --> 00:57:18.085
(light music)

952
00:57:20.287 --> 00:57:23.791
- No, no, no, no. I
don't know these people.


953
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:25.593
At least not like they
think they know me.


954
00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:27.695
- You don't remember them.

955
00:57:27.795 --> 00:57:29.997
Keep taking your
medication as prescribed


956
00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:32.299
and I promise you
that will change.


957
00:57:34.802 --> 00:57:38.172
- I wanna see where your
experiments are conducted, okay?


958
00:57:38.272 --> 00:57:39.507
- Take me to that room.

959
00:57:39.607 --> 00:57:41.375
- I don't think
that's a good idea.


960
00:57:41.475 --> 00:57:43.010
- Oh, I do.

961
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:51.986
(tense music)

962
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:58.092
This isn't the room
I was talking about.


963
00:57:58.192 --> 00:57:59.559
And you know it.

964
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.329
- You slept in that
bed for over 18 months.


965
00:58:09.437 --> 00:58:10.971
- Who did this?

966
00:58:11.539 --> 00:58:13.573
Who is this?

967
00:58:13.674 --> 00:58:15.810
- You kidding me?

968
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.845
You painted that for
me, you son of a bitch.


969
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.581
- I know you.

970
00:58:23.117 --> 00:58:25.152
- [Fielder] This
is Toby Sinclair.


971
00:58:27.088 --> 00:58:29.523
- I knew you before, uh-uh.

972
00:58:29.623 --> 00:58:31.258
We were friends.

973
00:58:31.358 --> 00:58:34.895
We were close.

974
00:58:34.995 --> 00:58:37.231
- You could say that.

975
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:39.733
But we didn't get a
proper goodbye, did we?


976
00:58:42.736 --> 00:58:44.238
- Did I hurt you?

977
00:58:47.842 --> 00:58:50.377
- No, that wasn't you.

978
00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:53.414
- We should go, Stephen.

979
00:58:53.514 --> 00:58:55.349
You got what you wanted.

980
00:58:55.449 --> 00:58:57.718
And Mr. Sinclair needs his rest.

981
00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.288
- Okay.

982
00:59:01.388 --> 00:59:02.790
- Stephen, let's go.

983
00:59:04.358 --> 00:59:09.797
- Yeah, can I just
see that for a second?


984
00:59:11.532 --> 00:59:14.168
(tense music)

985
00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:26.347
(dramatic music)

986
00:59:30.417 --> 00:59:31.185
- You didn't take the pill!

987
00:59:31.285 --> 00:59:32.353
- You know what?

988
00:59:32.453 --> 00:59:33.622
- I'm done with this fantasy.

989
00:59:33.721 --> 00:59:35.089
I'm done with this game.

990
00:59:35.189 --> 00:59:37.191
- Put the gun down.
- Listen to the doc.


991
00:59:37.291 --> 00:59:38.159
This ain't you.

992
00:59:38.259 --> 00:59:39.126
Shut up. Shut up.

993
00:59:39.226 --> 00:59:40.427
Gimme your keys.

994
00:59:40.528 --> 00:59:42.129
I'm getting the hell outta here.

995
00:59:42.229 --> 00:59:45.966
- You're not a violent man,
Stephen, put the gun down.


996
00:59:46.066 --> 00:59:47.334
- You don't know me.

997
00:59:47.434 --> 00:59:48.802
You're not even real.

998
00:59:48.903 --> 00:59:50.070
You're just another one
of her plants, okay?


999
00:59:50.171 --> 00:59:51.772
Give me your goddamn keys.

1000
00:59:51.872 --> 00:59:53.474
- If this is some
elaborate fantasy,


1001
00:59:53.574 --> 00:59:55.142
why do you need my keys?

1002
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.478
- That's a really good point.

1003
00:59:57.578 --> 01:00:02.249
- Stephen, no!
(shot firing)


1004
01:00:03.284 --> 01:00:04.285
(tense music)

1005
01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:08.055
- Stephen, I'm not
gonna hurt you.


1006
01:00:08.155 --> 01:00:10.124
You're not gonna hurt me either.

1007
01:00:10.224 --> 01:00:12.826
You don't have a violent
bone in your body.


1008
01:00:12.927 --> 01:00:14.261
You couldn't even hurt a--

1009
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.997
(shot firing)

1010
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.478
- Stephen, were those gunshots?

1011
01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:33.847
Are you all right?

1012
01:00:33.948 --> 01:00:35.684
- What are you doing here?

1013
01:00:35.783 --> 01:00:37.084
- Dr Fielder asked me to come.

1014
01:00:37.184 --> 01:00:39.720
- Oh, you're in on
this, aren't you?


1015
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.591
Oh.

1016
01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:45.359
- Please, you're
a very sick man.


1017
01:00:46.927 --> 01:00:50.164
But Dr. Fielder, she
can fix you right up.


1018
01:00:50.264 --> 01:00:51.065
Right?

1019
01:00:51.165 --> 01:00:52.634
She just needs more time.

1020
01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:55.202
- Dr. Fielder's dead,
see, I shot her.


1021
01:00:55.302 --> 01:00:58.305
Yeah, this is all just a well
constructed hallucination.


1022
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.675
None of it is
real. Not even you.


1023
01:01:00.774 --> 01:01:01.508
- No, baby...

1024
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.509
- Yeah.

1025
01:01:02.611 --> 01:01:04.812
- This is me. All right?

1026
01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:06.580
Our life's real.

1027
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:08.449
Our love, it's real.

1028
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:11.051
Why don't you just
hand me that, huh?


1029
01:01:11.151 --> 01:01:12.286
Come on.

1030
01:01:12.386 --> 01:01:13.887
- This is the only
move I have left.


1031
01:01:13.988 --> 01:01:15.856
- No, baby. Come on.

1032
01:01:15.956 --> 01:01:17.524
No, stop, please! Listen to me.

1033
01:01:17.626 --> 01:01:18.559
Don't do that.

1034
01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.560
Stephen. Stephen, stop.

1035
01:01:19.661 --> 01:01:20.961
Look. Look at me please.

1036
01:01:21.061 --> 01:01:22.563
Okay, just listen
to me, look at me.


1037
01:01:22.664 --> 01:01:26.166
- I'll come find you on
the other side, I promise.


1038
01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:27.901
(shot firing)
(Alicia screaming)


1039
01:01:28.002 --> 01:01:31.872
- (indistinct) come back.

1040
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.809
(indistinct)

1041
01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:44.818
(monitors beeping)

1042
01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:46.954
- We're losing him!

1043
01:01:47.054 --> 01:01:50.524
Stephen, (indistinct)!

1044
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.893
(Stephen screaming)

1045
01:01:52.993 --> 01:01:58.198
(Stephen grunting)
(dramatic fast paced music)


1046
01:02:00.367 --> 01:02:03.237
(nurse grunting)

1047
01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:32.399
(tense music)

1048
01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:44.912
(tense music continues)

1049
01:02:56.557 --> 01:03:00.094
(tense music continues)

1050
01:03:15.976 --> 01:03:19.513
(tense music continues)

1051
01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:23.450
- [Alicia] Oh, I'll
keep him honest.


1052
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.152
Do you think I
changed the bulbs?


1053
01:03:25.252 --> 01:03:26.353
- [Stephen] Have you
seen "Talking Texas?"


1054
01:03:26.453 --> 01:03:28.355
- What? (groans)

1055
01:03:28.455 --> 01:03:30.924
(indistinct)

1056
01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:34.061
Are you making fun of me?
- Yes.


1057
01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:36.296
You're gonna tell me
anyway, as soon as I can.


1058
01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:38.165
- How long we've been friends?

1059
01:03:38.265 --> 01:03:40.602
(voices overlapping)

1060
01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:42.136
- I'll be out. Right?

1061
01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:46.573
I honestly can't even remember.

1062
01:03:46.674 --> 01:03:50.411
Take long as you need.
(voices overlapping)


1063
01:03:50.511 --> 01:03:52.312
- [Alicia] Just
forget about the past.


1064
01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:56.885
(voices overlapping)
(siren blaring)


1065
01:03:56.984 --> 01:04:00.053
(dramatic music)

1066
01:04:07.161 --> 01:04:11.098
(dramatic music continues)

1067
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.117
(dramatic music continues)

1068
01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:37.625
- You're awake now.

1069
01:04:39.193 --> 01:04:40.728
This is reality.

1070
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:45.566
(dramatic music continues)

1071
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.805
Jenny. Jenny.

1072
01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:52.807
Hey, it's me. It's Stephen.

1073
01:04:52.907 --> 01:04:54.975
I know you're scared, shh, shh.

1074
01:04:57.544 --> 01:04:59.213
Hey, you gotta be
really quiet. Okay?


1075
01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:00.715
Or they might come.

1076
01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.885
I know what they're doing here.

1077
01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.486
I know what they're doing.

1078
01:05:05.587 --> 01:05:07.722
I'm gonna get outta
here and I'm gonna


1079
01:05:07.822 --> 01:05:09.289
burn this place to the ground.

1080
01:05:09.389 --> 01:05:11.525
I swear to you, Jenny. I swear.

1081
01:05:15.864 --> 01:05:17.431
Hey, hey.

1082
01:05:19.801 --> 01:05:21.703
Shhh, shhh, it's okay.

1083
01:05:25.707 --> 01:05:27.642
(door opening)

1084
01:05:27.742 --> 01:05:30.444
(tense music)

1085
01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:44.091
(tense music continues)

1086
01:05:58.071 --> 01:06:00.975
(tense music continues)

1087
01:06:01.074 --> 01:06:03.443
(Jenny cries out)

1088
01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:08.783
(men grunting)
(dramatic music)


1089
01:06:11.686 --> 01:06:14.555
(taser whirring)

1090
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:24.164
(Stephen panting)

1091
01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:33.608
(door opening)

1092
01:06:49.891 --> 01:06:53.628
(dramatic music continues)

1093
01:07:02.135 --> 01:07:04.171
- Manny, Darius, any luck?

1094
01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:06.406
- No. No sign of him.

1095
01:07:06.506 --> 01:07:07.809
- How about your team?

1096
01:07:07.909 --> 01:07:10.210
Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey.

1097
01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:14.983
Stop, stay calm.

1098
01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.350
You're making a mistake.

1099
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.484
You're not gonna hurt me.

1100
01:07:17.585 --> 01:07:18.385
- Oh yeah?

1101
01:07:18.485 --> 01:07:19.687
Don't be so sure.

1102
01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:22.322
I've already done
it once before.


1103
01:07:22.422 --> 01:07:24.092
I know how good it feels.

1104
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:25.960
- Stay calm. It's okay.

1105
01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.629
It's okay.

1106
01:07:29.196 --> 01:07:30.698
- I'll do it.

1107
01:07:33.735 --> 01:07:36.303
(tense music)

1108
01:07:36.403 --> 01:07:38.873
- I don't want to
see you get harmed.


1109
01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:41.208
You're my star.

1110
01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:43.745
My life's work, all
this riding on you.


1111
01:07:45.747 --> 01:07:47.280
- Come on...

1112
01:07:51.786 --> 01:07:54.022
(door opening)

1113
01:07:54.122 --> 01:07:57.190
(car beeping)

1114
01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:00.527
(rapid tense music)

1115
01:08:05.532 --> 01:08:08.903
- Drive. (engine starting)

1116
01:08:27.454 --> 01:08:28.723
- You are doing so well.

1117
01:08:28.823 --> 01:08:30.758
That's the real
shame in all of this.


1118
01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:32.593
- Oh God, save it.

1119
01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:34.796
I'm not sick and
I'm not violent.


1120
01:08:34.896 --> 01:08:37.464
Hell, I couldn't even hurt.
- Even hurt a fly.


1121
01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:39.667
That's the man we're
trying to make out of you.


1122
01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:42.335
Non-violent, law
abiding, decent.


1123
01:08:42.436 --> 01:08:44.839
- I know that I'm
no killer. Okay?


1124
01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:45.907
I remember who I was.

1125
01:08:46.007 --> 01:08:47.441
I was a good person.

1126
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.443
- You remember what we
want you to remember.


1127
01:08:49.543 --> 01:08:51.211
- I'm not drugged up
or plugged into one


1128
01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:54.281
of your machines anymore, so
stop feeding me this garbage.


1129
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.717
Okay?

1130
01:08:55.817 --> 01:08:57.217
My mind was never
yours to mess with.


1131
01:08:57.317 --> 01:08:58.653
- I saved you from
years in prison.


1132
01:08:58.753 --> 01:09:00.588
Maybe even the electric
chair, Stephen,


1133
01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:03.423
I won't apologize for that.

1134
01:09:03.523 --> 01:09:05.026
There are currently 3000 people

1135
01:09:05.126 --> 01:09:06.526
on death row in this country.

1136
01:09:06.627 --> 01:09:08.328
Another two and a half
million more people


1137
01:09:08.428 --> 01:09:12.332
behind bars, lives completely
shattered, families destroyed.


1138
01:09:12.432 --> 01:09:14.102
The only thing
prisons are good at


1139
01:09:14.202 --> 01:09:17.004
is at creating career criminals.

1140
01:09:17.105 --> 01:09:18.572
I mean, I'm trying to fix that.

1141
01:09:18.673 --> 01:09:21.943
Give people a second
chance at a decent life.


1142
01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:25.312
- Wow, doc.

1143
01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:28.082
This just is so inspiring here.

1144
01:09:28.182 --> 01:09:29.549
I've never heard
someone describe


1145
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:32.887
brainwashing in
such a unique way.


1146
01:09:32.987 --> 01:09:35.857
- If my program
succeeds, that's the end


1147
01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:38.458
of an entire prison
industrial complex.


1148
01:09:38.558 --> 01:09:40.962
So all the people that
profit from it, I mean,


1149
01:09:41.062 --> 01:09:42.697
they're trying to shut me down.

1150
01:09:42.797 --> 01:09:46.000
- Well, hopefully
my escape gives them


1151
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.935
all the ammo that they need.

1152
01:09:48.035 --> 01:09:50.570
- You are a high profile
case, a unique blend


1153
01:09:50.671 --> 01:09:53.440
of mental illness and
clear sociopathic behavior.


1154
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.178
If I cure you, I
can cure anyone.


1155
01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:58.679
I need you, Stephen.

1156
01:10:00.047 --> 01:10:02.784
- I'm touched. Pull over.

1157
01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:13.761
- I can still cure you.

1158
01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.263
- There's only one
person that can cure me


1159
01:10:15.362 --> 01:10:17.297
and she sure as hell ain't you.

1160
01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:25.640
Get out.

1161
01:10:31.279 --> 01:10:34.381
- You are not gonna like what
you find out there, Stephen.


1162
01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:37.118
I'm not giving up on you,

1163
01:10:37.218 --> 01:10:39.687
but at some point it
won't be up to me anymore.


1164
01:10:45.026 --> 01:10:48.361
(engine rumbling,
tires screeching)


1165
01:10:51.899 --> 01:10:54.534
(tense music)

1166
01:11:05.213 --> 01:11:08.749
(tense music continues)

1167
01:11:17.992 --> 01:11:21.528
(tense music continues)

1168
01:11:25.233 --> 01:11:27.935
(dogs barking)

1169
01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:40.715
- Alicia, Alicia!

1170
01:11:43.918 --> 01:11:47.788
Alicia, come on,
pack your bags baby.


1171
01:11:47.889 --> 01:11:49.489
We gotta go.

1172
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:52.827
(crickets chirping)

1173
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.108
(tense music continues)

1174
01:12:27.695 --> 01:12:30.598
(bluesy music)

1175
01:12:37.838 --> 01:12:38.940
Okay.

1176
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.708
Alicia!

1177
01:12:42.276 --> 01:12:46.180
(Music playing

1178
01:13:01.662 --> 01:13:03.731
This is real.

1179
01:13:06.934 --> 01:13:08.602
Alicia!

1180
01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:11.973
Alicia?

1181
01:13:23.117 --> 01:13:25.753
(tense music)

1182
01:13:30.257 --> 01:13:32.960
(wind blowing)

1183
01:13:41.736 --> 01:13:44.872
(Stephen gasping)

1184
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.752
(music continues)

1185
01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:08.062
(music continues)

1186
01:14:18.406 --> 01:14:20.841
(Stephen shouting)

1187
01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:24.544
(taser zapping)
(man screaming)


1188
01:14:31.819 --> 01:14:34.722
(shots firing)

1189
01:14:44.532 --> 01:14:45.766
(tense music)

1190
01:14:45.866 --> 01:14:48.568
- (sighs) Dr. Fielder's
your last chance


1191
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:49.970
of being free one day.

1192
01:14:50.071 --> 01:14:51.238
- I'm innocent.

1193
01:14:51.338 --> 01:14:52.840
- Doesn't matter.

1194
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.509
They'll put you in prison
and throw away the key.


1195
01:14:55.609 --> 01:14:59.747
(taser zapping)
(Stephen grunting)


1196
01:14:59.847 --> 01:15:02.983
(Stephen panting)

1197
01:15:08.856 --> 01:15:12.059
(Stephen grunting)

1198
01:15:24.205 --> 01:15:25.206
- Lester!

1199
01:15:25.306 --> 01:15:27.208
- What the hell man?

1200
01:15:27.308 --> 01:15:28.709
- It's good to see you.

1201
01:15:30.845 --> 01:15:33.914
Hey, oh man, I'm
back. Come on in.


1202
01:15:34.014 --> 01:15:35.516
Yeah, I'm not gonna be

1203
01:15:35.616 --> 01:15:37.151
able to stick around here
too long by the looks


1204
01:15:37.251 --> 01:15:41.489
of this place, but
that's not what matters.


1205
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:43.057
Hey, you wouldn't have happened

1206
01:15:43.157 --> 01:15:46.794
to have seen Alicia, would you?

1207
01:15:47.528 --> 01:15:48.829
No?

1208
01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:50.331
I just, I'm really
worried about her


1209
01:15:50.431 --> 01:15:53.100
and just, I'm really
anxious to find her.


1210
01:15:54.535 --> 01:15:56.203
Lester.

1211
01:15:57.938 --> 01:16:00.374
- My name ain't Lester.

1212
01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:03.544
You got five seconds to
get the hell outta my house


1213
01:16:03.644 --> 01:16:05.212
before I blow your brains out.

1214
01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:06.247
- Your house?

1215
01:16:06.347 --> 01:16:08.682
- My house, my store.

1216
01:16:10.017 --> 01:16:12.286
You fooled me once.

1217
01:16:12.386 --> 01:16:13.988
It ain't happening again.

1218
01:16:18.559 --> 01:16:19.894
- No, no, no, no, no.

1219
01:16:19.994 --> 01:16:22.163
This is where Alicia
and I were happy.


1220
01:16:22.263 --> 01:16:23.664
This is our house.

1221
01:16:23.764 --> 01:16:25.232
What'd you do to her?

1222
01:16:25.332 --> 01:16:26.667
- What did I do to her?

1223
01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:27.801
By the time the cops found me in

1224
01:16:27.902 --> 01:16:29.604
the basement, she was long gone.

1225
01:16:29.703 --> 01:16:30.471
Ah!

1226
01:16:30.571 --> 01:16:31.472
Okay. I'm sorry.

1227
01:16:31.572 --> 01:16:33.574
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1228
01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:35.309
Help!

1229
01:16:37.711 --> 01:16:40.447
(Lester grunting) Help!

1230
01:16:40.548 --> 01:16:43.784
(Stephen whistling)

1231
01:16:49.723 --> 01:16:50.891
- I'm innocent.

1232
01:16:50.991 --> 01:16:53.794
- Innocent. My ass.

1233
01:16:53.894 --> 01:16:56.864
They sent you to the
funny farm for a reason.


1234
01:16:58.633 --> 01:16:59.967
- It was all a set up.

1235
01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:01.068
Alicia knows the truth.

1236
01:17:01.168 --> 01:17:02.870
She can clear all this up.

1237
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:05.072
Just please just
tell me where she is.


1238
01:17:05.172 --> 01:17:07.107
- I haven't got a
goddamn clue where she is


1239
01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:10.311
and you are testing my
patience, now get out,


1240
01:17:10.411 --> 01:17:15.950
or I'll drop you--

1241
01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:17.785
(knocking on door)

1242
01:17:17.885 --> 01:17:19.286
Can I help you folks?

1243
01:17:19.386 --> 01:17:20.988
- Yeah, we're sorry
to bother you.


1244
01:17:21.088 --> 01:17:23.157
We're just, we're having
a bit of car trouble.


1245
01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:24.626
- Car trouble?

1246
01:17:24.725 --> 01:17:25.759
No problem at all.

1247
01:17:25.859 --> 01:17:26.628
Let me grab my keys.

1248
01:17:26.727 --> 01:17:27.861
- Nice.

1249
01:17:27.962 --> 01:17:29.363
- I'm sure I can help...

1250
01:17:31.298 --> 01:17:32.499
Don't shoot me.

1251
01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:35.469
(dramatic music)

1252
01:17:36.638 --> 01:17:37.538
Calm down.

1253
01:17:37.639 --> 01:17:39.039
Don't, don't shoot now.

1254
01:17:40.975 --> 01:17:42.543
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

1255
01:17:42.644 --> 01:17:43.944
Why should I?

1256
01:17:44.044 --> 01:17:45.446
I couldn't hurt a...

1257
01:17:47.047 --> 01:17:49.950
(tense music)

1258
01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.388
I have to find my Alicia.

1259
01:17:55.856 --> 01:17:57.524
Just go.

1260
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.536
(tense music continues)

1261
01:18:21.548 --> 01:18:25.085
(tense music continues)

1262
01:18:42.469 --> 01:18:43.871
(tense music continues)

1263
01:18:43.971 --> 01:18:46.874
- My favorite town in
Mexico, that church.


1264
01:18:46.974 --> 01:18:48.309
You're gonna love it.

1265
01:18:53.814 --> 01:18:57.318
(tense music continues)

1266
01:19:02.757 --> 01:19:05.392
(dog barking)

1267
01:19:13.635 --> 01:19:17.171
(tense music continues)

1268
01:19:25.079 --> 01:19:28.616
(tense music continues)

1269
01:19:38.092 --> 01:19:41.629
(tense music continues)

1270
01:19:44.131 --> 01:19:46.967
(dog barking)

1271
01:19:57.645 --> 01:20:00.581
(engine starting)

1272
01:20:15.864 --> 01:20:18.499
(tense music)

1273
01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:36.450
(tense music continues)

1274
01:20:45.993 --> 01:20:48.929
(tense music continues)

1275
01:20:49.029 --> 01:20:53.500
(people speaking
foreign language)


1276
01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:08.215
(tense music continues)

1277
01:21:19.359 --> 01:21:24.331
(people whispering
in foreign language)


1278
01:21:44.786 --> 01:21:48.021
- Hola, father. Habla ingles?

1279
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:51.492
I'm looking for my girlfriend.

1280
01:21:51.593 --> 01:21:54.127
She used to come here when
she was a little girl.


1281
01:21:54.228 --> 01:21:56.296
Her name, her name is Alicia.

1282
01:21:56.396 --> 01:21:59.266
She's got dark hair,
yay tall, green eyes.


1283
01:21:59.366 --> 01:22:02.369
She's about 30, (speaking
foreign language).


1284
01:22:02.469 --> 01:22:05.205
I believe she's been
here for about a year,


1285
01:22:05.305 --> 01:22:07.307
a year and a half around here.

1286
01:22:07.407 --> 01:22:09.744
- She doesn't come here anymore.

1287
01:22:10.812 --> 01:22:11.679
- Father--

1288
01:22:11.779 --> 01:22:15.048
- Please go, now.

1289
01:22:42.844 --> 01:22:46.079
(people chattering)

1290
01:22:59.661 --> 01:23:01.663
- Senor, senor.

1291
01:23:03.932 --> 01:23:07.167
That girl, I have seen her.

1292
01:23:07.267 --> 01:23:08.535
- Alicia?
- Yeah.


1293
01:23:08.636 --> 01:23:09.771
- Where? Where?

1294
01:23:09.871 --> 01:23:11.973
- "Las calaveras"

1295
01:23:12.072 --> 01:23:14.274
- Las Calaveras?

1296
01:23:14.374 --> 01:23:17.979
(man speaking foreign language)

1297
01:23:18.078 --> 01:23:19.614
- What is that?

1298
01:23:25.118 --> 01:23:28.255
(engine rumbling)

1299
01:23:46.741 --> 01:23:49.644
(engine rumbling)
(tense music)


1300
01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:51.278
- Calaveras.

1301
01:24:03.024 --> 01:24:06.560
(tense music continues)

1302
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.770
(engines rumbling)

1303
01:24:34.022 --> 01:24:37.859
(distant voices overlapping)

1304
01:24:43.296 --> 01:24:46.000
(Stephen sighs)

1305
01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.736
(tense music)

1306
01:24:49.469 --> 01:24:52.674
(engines rumbling)

1307
01:25:12.225 --> 01:25:15.295
(birds chirping)

1308
01:25:22.269 --> 01:25:24.906
(tense music)

1309
01:25:34.381 --> 01:25:37.919
(tense music continues)

1310
01:25:41.354 --> 01:25:44.558
(papers crumpling)

1311
01:25:46.393 --> 01:25:48.096
(knocking on door)

1312
01:25:48.196 --> 01:25:51.364
- [Alicia] Door's open, fprget
your keys or something, baby?


1313
01:26:08.716 --> 01:26:10.383
- Alicia?

1314
01:26:10.484 --> 01:26:11.853
(glass shattering)

1315
01:26:11.953 --> 01:26:14.354
- Shit...

1316
01:26:14.454 --> 01:26:15.990
- Are you okay?

1317
01:26:18.325 --> 01:26:20.094
- Why are you here?

1318
01:26:20.194 --> 01:26:21.796
Why aren't you locked up?

1319
01:26:23.064 --> 01:26:25.133
- Busted out.

1320
01:26:25.233 --> 01:26:30.437
- Oh so you broke out,
made it across the border


1321
01:26:30.537 --> 01:26:32.039
and found me?

1322
01:26:35.342 --> 01:26:36.677
No.

1323
01:26:36.778 --> 01:26:38.311
No, Stephen.

1324
01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:41.348
No, that dog don't hunt.

1325
01:26:41.448 --> 01:26:42.884
- It's a miracle.

1326
01:26:42.984 --> 01:26:44.619
I know. It's a miracle.

1327
01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:46.587
Look, they put me in some
kind of mind control program.


1328
01:26:46.687 --> 01:26:48.823
Okay? They tried
to make me forget.


1329
01:26:48.923 --> 01:26:52.026
But the one thing that
stayed with me, the one thing


1330
01:26:52.126 --> 01:26:55.263
that always remained
was my love for you.


1331
01:26:55.362 --> 01:26:56.798
Are you listening to me?

1332
01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:00.534
- Stephen, you need to go. Okay?

1333
01:27:00.635 --> 01:27:03.336
There's probably like

1334
01:27:03.436 --> 01:27:05.372
so you should just
take it and leave.


1335
01:27:05.472 --> 01:27:08.542
Okay? And you should go.

1336
01:27:08.643 --> 01:27:10.778
- No, I didn't come
back here for the money.


1337
01:27:12.246 --> 01:27:13.714
I came back here for you.

1338
01:27:16.184 --> 01:27:17.517
I love you.

1339
01:27:17.618 --> 01:27:22.355
Please just, just
please tell me the truth


1340
01:27:23.658 --> 01:27:26.127
about who I am, our history,

1341
01:27:26.227 --> 01:27:27.862
how we got to this point.

1342
01:27:27.962 --> 01:27:31.933
I know it sounds insane, but
that's all I want, I swear.


1343
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:37.672
Is that meth?

1344
01:27:39.173 --> 01:27:41.242
(Alicia laughing)

1345
01:27:41.374 --> 01:27:43.010
- Is that meth?

1346
01:27:45.646 --> 01:27:48.249
You really don't remember
a thing, do you, Stephen?


1347
01:27:48.348 --> 01:27:49.851
- No, nothing.

1348
01:27:59.327 --> 01:28:00.828
- What do you want to know?

1349
01:28:01.863 --> 01:28:05.398
- Just start from the beginning.

1350
01:28:05.498 --> 01:28:08.435
- The beginning. (laughing)

1351
01:28:08.535 --> 01:28:09.871
We didn't become a thing

1352
01:28:09.971 --> 01:28:12.840
until you got all
pissed off at Toby.


1353
01:28:13.908 --> 01:28:15.575
- Toby?

1354
01:28:17.345 --> 01:28:19.046
No, I don't remember Toby.

1355
01:28:20.413 --> 01:28:22.683
- He was only your best friend

1356
01:28:24.517 --> 01:28:27.520
(tense music)

1357
01:28:27.622 --> 01:28:30.758
(engine rumbling)

1358
01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.761
Toby Sinclair.

1359
01:28:35.329 --> 01:28:36.764
I was one of them.

1360
01:28:39.901 --> 01:28:42.870
- Your boy started moving
drugs with the cartel,


1361
01:28:43.804 --> 01:28:45.472
making a lot of money.

1362
01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.440
Easy money.

1363
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.309
- Oh boy.

1364
01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:49.476
Moving drugs?

1365
01:28:49.576 --> 01:28:50.978
- Did you wanna know the truth

1366
01:28:51.078 --> 01:28:52.914
or do you want me to
start making shit up?


1367
01:28:54.815 --> 01:28:58.819
You know, I mean whatever's
gonna float your boat, darling.


1368
01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.089
You boys started moving
drugs for a while


1369
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:06.861
and for a while, you
know, things were good.


1370
01:29:08.296 --> 01:29:10.530
(patrons chattering)

1371
01:29:10.631 --> 01:29:12.033
Things were really good,

1372
01:29:12.767 --> 01:29:14.434
until you started using.

1373
01:29:15.803 --> 01:29:18.606
Drugs exacerbated
your condition.


1374
01:29:20.473 --> 01:29:21.909
They made you crazy.

1375
01:29:22.944 --> 01:29:24.679
They made you do crazy things.

1376
01:29:27.514 --> 01:29:32.019
The deal went bad
and you snapped,


1377
01:29:34.055 --> 01:29:37.024
started shooting.
(shots firing)


1378
01:29:37.124 --> 01:29:38.426
Folks ended up dead

1379
01:29:38.525 --> 01:29:42.296
and shit got turned
up in the club.


1380
01:29:42.396 --> 01:29:43.597
- You know he was a mess.

1381
01:29:43.698 --> 01:29:46.200
Please think about
it. - All right.


1382
01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.501
- Fuck man.

1383
01:29:48.602 --> 01:29:50.037
- Say it again.

1384
01:29:50.137 --> 01:29:51.504
- Lazlo and the boys

1385
01:29:51.605 --> 01:29:53.074
wanted to kill you
right then and there.


1386
01:29:53.174 --> 01:29:55.376
- You fucked up--
(voices overlapping).


1387
01:29:55.475 --> 01:29:56.576
- Toby!

1388
01:29:56.677 --> 01:29:57.712
(voices overlapping)

1389
01:29:57.812 --> 01:30:01.916
- Toby went inside to save you.

1390
01:30:02.883 --> 01:30:06.754
So he took you out of the game

1391
01:30:06.854 --> 01:30:10.891
and sat you on the bench
just to appease him.


1392
01:30:15.296 --> 01:30:16.864
Never forgave him for it.

1393
01:30:19.233 --> 01:30:24.138
So you decided to set
your sights on me.


1394
01:30:29.143 --> 01:30:31.112
- [Stephen] You
were Toby's girl.


1395
01:30:38.586 --> 01:30:40.287
- I always had a thing for you.

1396
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:45.259
Toby and the boys were
on the road for longer


1397
01:30:45.359 --> 01:30:46.794
and longer stretches.

1398
01:30:49.163 --> 01:30:51.732
(soft music)

1399
01:30:54.735 --> 01:30:56.270
I loved you.

1400
01:30:57.905 --> 01:30:59.874
Was addicted to you.

1401
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:06.914
We talked about
running away together.


1402
01:31:07.014 --> 01:31:11.852
- This part always made me
a little sick to my stomach.


1403
01:31:11.952 --> 01:31:14.188
- How long you been
standing there for, darling?


1404
01:31:14.288 --> 01:31:15.656
- Don't hurt her.

1405
01:31:15.756 --> 01:31:18.492
- She ain't the one
that needs to worry.


1406
01:31:18.592 --> 01:31:21.561
Come on baby, don't
stop right now.


1407
01:31:21.662 --> 01:31:22.797
You were doing so good.

1408
01:31:22.897 --> 01:31:24.632
Go ahead. Finish the story.

1409
01:31:24.732 --> 01:31:26.133
You're almost at the end.

1410
01:31:26.233 --> 01:31:28.235
Finish the story.

1411
01:31:28.335 --> 01:31:31.172
Alright, I'll do it.
(tense music)


1412
01:31:31.272 --> 01:31:32.506
Toby and me and the boys

1413
01:31:32.606 --> 01:31:34.708
were off celebrating
a job well done.


1414
01:31:35.476 --> 01:31:36.911
Isn't that right?

1415
01:31:39.947 --> 01:31:41.882
The cash was in Toby's safe

1416
01:31:41.982 --> 01:31:44.418
and you knew she
had the combination


1417
01:31:44.518 --> 01:31:47.455
- So you'd just be in and out.

1418
01:31:47.555 --> 01:31:49.090
Just like that.

1419
01:31:51.158 --> 01:31:52.827
- Okay.

1420
01:31:52.927 --> 01:31:54.829
I have conditions, okay?

1421
01:31:54.929 --> 01:31:56.530
I'm in charge now.

1422
01:31:56.630 --> 01:31:59.600
In charge of your health,
your wellbeing, everything.


1423
01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.001
That's the deal.

1424
01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:02.136
Alright?

1425
01:32:02.236 --> 01:32:04.305
Once all this is
over, no more drugs.


1426
01:32:04.405 --> 01:32:08.242
We move south and we'll be
safe there and we'll be happy.


1427
01:32:08.342 --> 01:32:09.710
Alright?

1428
01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:11.846
Promise, okay?
- Okay.


1429
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.615
Let's get her done.

1430
01:32:14.715 --> 01:32:17.351
(tense music)

1431
01:32:18.385 --> 01:32:21.322
(Alicia laughing)

1432
01:32:26.627 --> 01:32:28.462
(engine rumbling)

1433
01:32:28.562 --> 01:32:30.297
- Stephen, Stephen, it's him.

1434
01:32:30.397 --> 01:32:31.999
- That's enough.

1435
01:32:32.099 --> 01:32:34.702
- You remember what you did
to my brother, don't you?


1436
01:32:37.505 --> 01:32:40.341
(punch landing)

1437
01:32:40.441 --> 01:32:43.310
(dramatic music)

1438
01:32:48.617 --> 01:32:50.751
Take the money,
get the fuck out.


1439
01:32:50.851 --> 01:32:53.320
I blame myself for
listening to my brother.


1440
01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.788
(Stephen screaming)

1441
01:32:54.889 --> 01:32:56.190
- Just walk outta
here with your money.


1442
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.324
- Yeah.

1443
01:32:57.424 --> 01:32:59.727
- And take this bitch with you.

1444
01:32:59.827 --> 01:33:02.196
I'm done with both of you.

1445
01:33:04.365 --> 01:33:06.333
When my brother and
the rest of them


1446
01:33:06.433 --> 01:33:10.838
find out what happened,
they'll come after you.


1447
01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:15.776
- [Alicia] Stephen.
Stephen, let's go.


1448
01:33:17.244 --> 01:33:20.381
- And I ain't lifting a
finger to save you this time.


1449
01:33:20.481 --> 01:33:22.183
You ain't worth it.

1450
01:33:24.585 --> 01:33:27.755
- You really think you're
better than me, don't you?


1451
01:33:30.157 --> 01:33:32.793
You know...
- Stephen.


1452
01:33:32.893 --> 01:33:37.064
- I always lied to you.
(tense music)


1453
01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:41.302
- No Stephen!

1454
01:33:41.402 --> 01:33:44.071
(Toby gasping)

1455
01:33:53.113 --> 01:33:54.715
- Oh, what did you do?

1456
01:33:54.815 --> 01:33:58.352
Oh my God, he's...he's dead.

1457
01:33:58.452 --> 01:34:00.821
Shouldn't have done
that. They're coming,
they're gonna kill us!


1458
01:34:00.921 --> 01:34:02.890
- Listen, listen,
we'll take his car.


1459
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:04.725
We'll have to get
rid of the body.


1460
01:34:04.825 --> 01:34:06.327
Okay?

1461
01:34:06.427 --> 01:34:07.528
By the time the Laszlo
figures out he's missing,


1462
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:08.429
we'll be long gone.

1463
01:34:08.529 --> 01:34:09.997
Okay, listen.

1464
01:34:10.097 --> 01:34:11.232
Remember that place you
like down in Mexico, huh?


1465
01:34:11.332 --> 01:34:12.800
- Okay.

1466
01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.735
- Ditch his car and the body.
No one's ever gonna find us.


1467
01:34:14.835 --> 01:34:16.904
Okay?
- Okay.


1468
01:34:17.004 --> 01:34:22.042
(Stephen shouting)
(tense music)


1469
01:34:23.844 --> 01:34:25.546
(Stephen crying out)

1470
01:34:25.647 --> 01:34:28.349
(Stephen groaning)

1471
01:34:28.449 --> 01:34:31.852
- I never thought I'd
get a second chance.


1472
01:34:41.228 --> 01:34:45.165
(dramatic music continues)

1473
01:34:49.604 --> 01:34:51.438
I'm gonna enjoy this, Stephen.

1474
01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.909
- No, look, wait!

1475
01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:58.647
Just think about it--
(Stephen screams)


1476
01:34:58.747 --> 01:35:00.948
(dramatic music)

1477
01:35:01.048 --> 01:35:04.051
(Laszlo groans)

1478
01:35:15.764 --> 01:35:17.798
- What did you just do?!

1479
01:35:17.898 --> 01:35:19.433
What did you just do?!

1480
01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:21.502
- Baby, he was gonna kill me.
(Alicia crying)


1481
01:35:21.603 --> 01:35:25.339
Please. I'm not a
bad guy, I swear.


1482
01:35:25.439 --> 01:35:28.710
Whatever they did to me
in there, they changed me.


1483
01:35:28.842 --> 01:35:30.044
I'm a changed man.

1484
01:35:30.144 --> 01:35:31.746
Please, you gotta believe me.

1485
01:35:31.845 --> 01:35:34.214
I love you more than the old
me could ever understand.


1486
01:35:34.315 --> 01:35:38.986
- No, Stephen, just
stop. Please stop.


1487
01:35:39.086 --> 01:35:43.223
No, this is what you do,

1488
01:35:43.324 --> 01:35:47.127
and you're really good
at it, aren't you Steve?


1489
01:35:47.227 --> 01:35:48.797
This is what you do.
- Please...


1490
01:35:48.896 --> 01:35:50.331
- Every time.

1491
01:35:50.431 --> 01:35:53.367
Oh god, oh please
stop, make it stop.


1492
01:35:53.467 --> 01:35:58.339
I loved you and I was here for
you every time you were here.


1493
01:35:59.774 --> 01:36:01.508
Look at this.

1494
01:36:01.609 --> 01:36:03.344
I'm not gonna be nasty, I'm not.

1495
01:36:03.444 --> 01:36:05.680
I'm not gonna be nasty,
please (indistinct).


1496
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:10.417
I'm not gonna let you just
show up and ruin my life again.


1497
01:36:10.517 --> 01:36:12.886
Look at this, please.

1498
01:36:12.986 --> 01:36:15.989
It's not gonna happen.

1499
01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:21.161
Not here, get it--
(shot firing)


1500
01:36:23.364 --> 01:36:26.200
(birds chirping)

1501
01:36:36.543 --> 01:36:40.615
(tense music)
(Stephen gasping)


1502
01:36:52.192 --> 01:36:55.396
(glass shattering)

1503
01:37:08.142 --> 01:37:11.679
(tense music continues)

1504
01:37:25.559 --> 01:37:29.096
(tense music continues)

1505
01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.134
- Stephen, welcome home.

1506
01:37:35.169 --> 01:37:36.537
I'm glad you're back.

1507
01:37:38.038 --> 01:37:42.276
- You said you knew all
about my case, details.


1508
01:37:43.177 --> 01:37:45.112
- I know about all my cases.

1509
01:37:46.881 --> 01:37:50.618
- So everyone in here...

1510
01:37:50.718 --> 01:37:56.156
- Everyone in here, like
out there, makes mistakes.


1511
01:38:00.994 --> 01:38:02.463
- You were right, doc.

1512
01:38:04.465 --> 01:38:07.234
I'm not the person
that I thought I was,


1513
01:38:11.405 --> 01:38:15.743
but it's all coming back, doc.

1514
01:38:20.013 --> 01:38:21.381
It's all coming back.

1515
01:38:22.349 --> 01:38:25.587
(Stephen whistling)

1516
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.358

1517
01:38:44.271 --> 01:38:49.543
