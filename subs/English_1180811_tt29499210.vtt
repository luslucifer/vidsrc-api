1
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.590
Gracie? Mia?

2
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.840
What are you kids
doing up there?


3
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.810
Gracie?

4
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.020
Mia?

5
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.280
My turkey?!

6
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.040
Merry Christmas!

7
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.830
Thanks for calling
the Holiday Hotline.


8
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.000
Holiday Hotline.

9
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.370
Let's talk Turkey!

10
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.370
You did what to your turkey?!

11
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.880
And bless you too.

12
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420
Okay, it's a long story, but I
can't get it out of the dryer!


13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.800
Oh, so you're saying I was
supposed to remove the bag


14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.550
before cooking it?

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.640
Well, you see it's, um,

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.640
it's...it's stuck on the
end of my hockey stick.


17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.350
Abby: The Holiday Hotline.

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.560
Every year, between
Thanksgiving and Christmas,


19
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.530
these poultry professionals
calm the nerves of over


20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.200
100,000 turkey first-timers.

21
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.280
Sure, they could google it, but
there's nothing like talking


22
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.410
to a real live person.

23
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.290
Okay, alright.

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.580
Just take a deep breath.

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.540
We're going to get
through this together.


26
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.330
Abby: And speaking of real
people, that's me, Abby Mitchel,


27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.250
after a month in America.

28
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.340
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.420
My name is Peggy.

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.050
Let's talk turkey!

31
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.760
Abby: Well, "sort of" me.

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.470
You might be wondering
how Abby could be


33
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.430
the same person as Peggy.

34
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.810
Well, it all started
back in England,


35
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.810
with some delicious
Yorkshire puddings.


36
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.890
My delicious
Yorkshire puddings!


37
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.060
No, Jason.

38
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.310
That's where
you're wrong.


39
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.730
They're MY
Yorkshire puddings.


40
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.770
Unbelievable.

41
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.360
Abby, darling,
what are you doing?


42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.690
I read the
article, Jason.


43
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740
They gave the restaurant
a wonderful review.


44
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.740
Maybe you've forgotten, but I
created that Yorkshire pudding.


45
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.580
It put this place
on the map.


46
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740
And you didn't even
bother to mention my name.


47
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.960
Abby, darling, that
was an oversight, luv.


48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
I don't think so.

49
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.870
You used me.

50
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
You took credit
for the pudding


51
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.670
and every other dish
I created here.


52
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.000
Abby.

53
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.420
When I first started here
six, no, seven years ago,


54
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380
you promised you'd
make me a head chef.


55
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.760
And you still
could be.


56
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.140
No.

57
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.930
It's not just the article,
Jason, it's how you operate.


58
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.680
You're not
trustworthy.


59
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.100
If you really loved me, you
wouldn't take advantage of me.


60
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.810
Please, darling,
please.


61
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.980
Stop.

62
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.610
Look, you're right.

63
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.780
I should have given you more
credit, but it's complicated.


64
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.400
I mean the public wants
to believe that...


65
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080
But Abby, that, that's
not what it looks like.


66
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.790
Really?

67
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.250
I thought you were done
with that kind of thing.


68
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.540
I can explain.

69
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.130
I don't think so.

70
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.880
Betrayed me in work and
you betrayed me in love.


71
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.720
I'm done.

72
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.890
I quit.

73
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.800
I quit you and everything
that goes with it.


74
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.640
Abby: And just like that, seven
years as a sous chef in one of


75
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.480
London's finest restaurants,
most of which were in a rocky


76
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.480
relationship, were
tossed in the rubbish,


77
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480
like a tray of
Yorkshire pudding.


78
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.820
Of course, I was devastated.

79
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.860
Fortunately for me, my Mum
and Dad had just the remedy.


80
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.820
Almost there, keep
your eyes closed.


81
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.160
Oh, no, no.

82
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.530
Okay, ready and, okay, okay,
stay there, stand there.


83
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.830
Open your eyes.

84
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.670
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!


85
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.750
But, it's November.

86
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.460
We know how much
you love Christmas,


87
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.510
so we decided to
celebrate early.


88
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.550
We thought it might
help cheer you up.


89
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.430
And since you won't be
home for the holidays...


90
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.720
I won't?

91
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680
Archie, you're gonna
ruin the surprise!
Not me.


92
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.270
Merry Christmas,
sweetie.


93
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.060
What's this?

94
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.350
You're going
to Chicago!


95
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.820
Aunt Dorene just moved to a
retirement village in Florida.


96
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.650
And her Chicago place is
just sitting empty until


97
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.650
it goes on the
market in January.


98
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.820
We thought a change
would do you good.


99
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.200
And get your mind off
the restaurant business.


100
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.120
And off that ridiculously
handsome chef.
Diane.


101
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.700
What?
He is handsome.


102
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.330
Well, even if
he's a bit dodgy.


103
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.750
I guess you're right.

104
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.710
I could use
some time away.


105
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.630
That's right!
Regroup.


106
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.800
Get a fresh
perspective.


107
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.630
Out with the old,
in with the new.


108
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.970
The sun will come
up tomorrow.


109
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.930
Seat of honour.

110
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.850
Don't worry,
darling.


111
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.730
You will still be a
head chef someday.


112
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.560
I highly doubt that.

113
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.030
Truly, the last thing I want
to do right now is cook.


114
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.360
It only reminds me of him
and all the time I wasted,


115
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.620
and heartache.

116
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.330
If I even make toast in the
next year, it'll be too soon.


117
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.830
Don't be daft.

118
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.500
All you need is
a fresh start.


119
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.580
Happy Christmas!

120
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.420
Happy Christmas!

121
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.760
Alright, to a
new adventure!


122
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.880
Anything
without cooking!


123
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.760
Bon Appetit!

124
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.730
That bad, huh?

125
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.610
You should have
used the Slow Cooker.


126
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.860
Yeah, well, the
thing's busted.


127
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.780
But the oven
should've worked fine.


128
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.440
I mean its chicken.

129
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.780
How hard can it be?

130
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.370
That hard, huh?

131
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.410
Okay, we're
ordering in.


132
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.790
Uhhh.

133
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.290
Alright, pick a
menu, any menu.


134
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.960
Italian!

135
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.380
Wise choice.

136
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.510
Hey, Gina, it's...yep.

137
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.890
Yeah.

138
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.430
Yeah, and a side of...yup.

139
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.640
With extra, yeah.

140
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.390
Okay, great.

141
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.810
Okay, what do you say we get
started on your homework


142
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.480
while we wait, hmm?

143
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.150
How about we
do it later?


144
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.240
It's hard to think
on an empty stomach.


145
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.860
Nice try.

146
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.990
Holiday worksheet.

147
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.330
What's this?

148
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.000
Some dumb essay
I have to write.


149
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.370
Not so dumb.

150
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.750
What's your
favorite holiday?


151
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.630
Duh, Christmas,
of course.
Duh.


152
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.340
And what's your
favorite tradition?


153
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.710
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.


154
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.380
What do you mean,
'it doesn't matter'?


155
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.720
C'mon, spill.

156
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.800
Well, I like to write
about Christmas dinner.


157
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.680
But we don't do
that anymore.


158
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.180
Sure, we do.
We go to Gramma's.


159
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.560
It's not the same as
doing it at our house.


160
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.350
I remember how it
used to feel here.


161
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.350
It was way better
at home, Dad.


162
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.900
I know it was.

163
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.280
But your mom was a
really great cook,


164
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.700
and she was great at planning,
and great at decorating


165
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.530
the table, and well,
pretty much everything.


166
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.620
You could do all that.

167
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.710
I can't even make a
chicken leg, sweetie.


168
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.420
And I'm pretty sure you can't
make a turkey in a Slow Cooker.


169
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.300
What do you say we hold off
on this essay for now, huh?


170
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.720
It's okay, I can write
about opening presents.


171
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.680
No, no, I'm gonna
figure it out.


172
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.680
I am sure I can
do a turkey.


173
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.730
I mean, I'm
pretty sure.


174
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.390
Pretty sure?
Yeah.


175
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.900
You okay to wait?

176
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.730
Okay.

177
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.380
Oh, thank you so much.

178
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.970
Hey, Jack, let's go.

179
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.310
We need to be in Wicker
Park in twenty minutes.


180
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.390
Jack?

181
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.810
You okay?

182
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.690
I've decided to have Christmas
dinner at our house this year.


183
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.940
Okay.

184
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.780
First off, it's not
even Thanksgiving yet,


185
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.280
and secondly and much
more importantly,


186
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.570
you can't boil water.

187
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.280
Uh, well, I can learn.

188
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.950
We're gonna have a big
Christmas dinner at the house


189
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.830
just like we used to
before Nikki died.


190
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.290
Jessica deserves it.

191
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.450
We both do.

192
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.210
Okay, well, good
luck with that.


193
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.670
Oh, do you want me to
order Chinese now


194
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.460
or wait until
Christmas?


195
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.670
You're fired.

196
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.460
You can't fire me,
I'm your brother.


197
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.970
My name is
on the wall.


198
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.970
Look, all I'm saying is that
cooking a turkey dinner


199
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.300
is a big hill to
climb for anybody.


200
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.640
Why don't you give yourself
a break and take Jessica


201
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.310
to moms for
Christmas dinner?


202
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.850
Because it's not her
home, that's why.


203
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.160
Oh, excuse me, hello.

204
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.530
I'm sorry to
bother you.


205
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.490
But where might I
find the lift?


206
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.660
Oooh, a British accent!

207
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.540
Are you Abigail?

208
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.460
The chef?

209
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.380
I am.

210
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.000
But please
call me Abby.


211
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.130
Well, Abby, if you're
for an elevator...


212
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.670
Nothing but
stairs here.


213
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.510
Oh, dear.

214
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.180
I'm Margaret.

215
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.850
Your great-aunt Dorene told
me "The British Were Coming!"


216
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.220
You're in 16.

217
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.850
I'm just down
from you in 17.


218
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.940
Anything you need,
you just come on over.


219
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.350
But don't ring
the doorbell.


220
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.310
It's like nails on a
chalkboard for my hearing aid.


221
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.570
I won't.
Let me help you
with your bags.


222
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.360
Oh, no.
I've lived here for
fifty years, young lady.


223
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.870
And I may not look it but I am,
as my grandkids say, "ripped".


224
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.330
But still, I can't...
Too late!


225
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.660
Uh.

226
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.370
Hang on!

227
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.250
Right behind you!

228
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.760
I just hope this doesn't
take too long, hon,


229
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.260
my shift starts at
eleven tonight


230
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.550
and I still
haven't slept.


231
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.590
Don't worry.

232
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.140
It'll be quick.

233
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.390
But once the restorations start,
it's gonna be a mess in there.


234
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.430
Well, I guess that means
I'll just have to spend


235
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.600
more time at
your place.


236
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.940
See, there's a silver
lining to everything.


237
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.360
And when Jack and I are
done with this place,


238
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.440
it is going to be so beautiful
you're not gonna want to leave.


239
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.990
Oh, well maybe I'll
call off the engagement


240
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.610
just so I can
stay here.


241
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.910
You know, I'm starting to
wonder if you said 'yes'


242
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.870
just for my
architectural skills.


243
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.620
Oh, but you
know I did.


244
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.420
Kissing the client?

245
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.080
Very unprofessional.

246
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.460
How about you
measure the suite?


247
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.630
And Erica will show
me the boiler room.


248
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.840
Don't worry, I promise to be
the ultimate professional.


249
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.760
Right.

250
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.440
Dorene said something
about you working for a posh


251
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.810
restaurant in London.

252
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.270
Oh, hi.

253
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.150
Yes, four years at the Royal
Academy of Culinary Arts,


254
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.360
and seven in
fine dining.


255
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.860
All sorts of complex
dishes, I would imagine.


256
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.910
Cornish Hen, Jellied
Eels, Beef Wellington?


257
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.240
The gamut, yes.

258
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.790
And now you're
making me hungry!


259
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.750
I can break a
twenty if needed.


260
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.630
Oh, uh, let me
see what I have.


261
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.380
I'm just
kidding, dear.


262
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.790
It's on the house.

263
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.050
And welcome
to Chicago.


264
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.300
Right.

265
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.060
Do you need some help?

266
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.850
Um, no, I, I think I've
got it sorted, thank you.


267
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.940
Oh!

268
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.190
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!


269
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.820
What have you done?

270
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.820
Um, it's just a
door handle.


271
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.990
It can be fixed.

272
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.700
No, it can't.

273
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.200
It's original to
the building.


274
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.290
It's irreplaceable.

275
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.710
I'm sorry, I'm a little
confused as to why you have


276
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.670
any concern
about my door.


277
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.330
Do you own
the building?


278
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.420
No, no, I'm the architect
who's gonna be restoring


279
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.380
the apartments over
the next few years.


280
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.510
I don't think you
understand...


281
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.840
you just broke a
piece of history.


282
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.760
I'll find a
replacement.


283
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.220
And for the record, I understand
the value of old things.


284
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.020
Where I'm from, this building
is practically brand new.


285
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.690
Huh, if I had a nickel
for every time someone


286
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.900
from Europe
said that...


287
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.560
Hey, hey, hey there.

288
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.480
Hi, I'm Mike, and this
is Erica, my finance.


289
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.900
Hi, I live just
down the hall.


290
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.950
I'm Abby.

291
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.280
Nice to meet you.

292
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.780
I'll be your new
neighbor for a while.


293
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.410
Oh great.

294
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.620
If I can get in.

295
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.950
Oh, don't worry, we'll
help you get inside.


296
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.700
So, what happened?

297
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.460
Disaster happened.

298
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.670
Seriously?

299
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.710
Ah, this is my
brother Jack.


300
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.750
Oh, we've met.

301
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.880
Don't worry, we'll find another
one somewhere in the city.


302
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.300
It's just gonna
take a little time.


303
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.850
What a measured,
appropriate response.


304
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.390
Thank you.

305
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.720
Oh!

306
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.440
Know any good
locksmiths?


307
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.600
You didn't have to be so prickly
with Erica's new neighbor.


308
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.230
I wasn't prickly.

309
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.610
Everything in that
building is priceless.


310
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.400
She shouldn't have been
yanking on the door handle.


311
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.780
C'mon, we know this has nothing
to do with the door handle.


312
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.410
What's up?

313
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.910
I don't know.

314
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.580
I guess I'm just
worried about Jessica


315
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.620
and making Christmas
normal for her again.


316
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.410
I have to get our
lives back on track.


317
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.870
I'm not sure I can pull it
off the same way Nikki did.


318
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.250
Maybe you're being a little
too hard on yourself.


319
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.460
Are you sure you can
go through with this?


320
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.670
Well, I have to,

321
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.800
now that I realize how
important it is for her.


322
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.970
You know, I've
been thinking, too,


323
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.680
Thanksgiving is
only two days away.


324
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.220
I can start by making a "trial
turkey", and bring it over


325
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.640
to mom and dads for
Thanksgiving, huh.


326
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.890
Oh, boy. That sounds
like a recipe for disaster.


327
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.480
Pun definitely intended.

328
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.520
C'mon, have a little
faith in your brother.


329
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.770
It's a turkey, how
hard could it be, huh?


330
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.860
And this coming
from the brother


331
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.270
who couldn't even
toast a pop tart.


332
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.400
I'm telling you, Mikey, I am
gonna step up to the plate


333
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.450
and make Christmas dinner,
at home, for Jessica.


334
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.820
I've got to swing for the
fences this year, man.
Okay, okay.


335
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.790
Move over Gordon Ramsey,
there's a new cook in town.


336
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.510
Abby!
Oh, Margaret!


337
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.470
Good morning.

338
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.390
I'm so glad I
ran into you.


339
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.390
I'm in a bit
of a pickle.
A pickle?


340
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.140
Yeah, you see
I'm new at this.


341
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.310
I got a thirteen-pound turkey,
and Thanksgiving is tomorrow.
Oh.


342
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.600
I'm so glad
you're here.


343
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.520
So, what should
I cook it at?


344
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.480
In a regular oven,

345
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.610
I mean 325 Fahrenheit for
three and a half hours.


346
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.780
Basting?
Basting is fine, for an
elementary approach,


347
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.790
but you risk losing conduction
heat with each oven intrusion,


348
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.710
never mind that a herb-butter
browns just the same.


349
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.330
To brine or
not to brine?
Easy question.


350
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.540
It's a "no briner".

351
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.550
Sorry, bad joke.

352
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.840
Definitely brine.
You're so helpful.


353
00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.470
And good.

354
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.720
Even better than
I expected.


355
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.230
What's that?

356
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.270
That is the turkey I'm
making for Thanksgiving.


357
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.230
You're making
a turkey?


358
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.780
What about gramma?

359
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.610
She's getting
the day off.


360
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.580
It's as hard as
a rock, Dad.


361
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.200
Doesn't it need
time to thaw?


362
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.700
Right, yeah.

363
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.210
I'm sure you're right,
and I'm gonna get to that,


364
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.920
right after breakfast.

365
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.880
Uh, cottage
cheese and fruit.


366
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.640
Save some for me.

367
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.640
You're new in town, so you're
probably looking for a job?


368
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.390
Oh, not really.

369
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.440
Well, you're in luck because
who doesn't need a little


370
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.480
extra cash around
the holidays?


371
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.730
That's lovely, Margaret,
but I'm not sure.


372
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.980
It's the perfect job!

373
00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.320
Seasonal, part-time, and
you need to know someone


374
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360
to get your foot
in the door.


375
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.450
But I'm not
looking for...


376
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.530
It's the
Holiday Hotline.


377
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.580
Let's talk Turkey!

378
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.910
I don't suppose you
have that in England.


379
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.380
Here, it's where folks from all
over the country call for help


380
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.340
with their
holiday turkeys.


381
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.760
And people talk
them through it?


382
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.220
Oh, not just "people".

383
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
Experts like
you and me.


384
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.470
But I thought you were
cooking your first turkey.


385
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.260
Sorry, but that
was a test.


386
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.220
I had to make sure
you were up to it.


387
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.810
Okay, I don't
quite understand.


388
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.650
I promised my family I'd show
up for Thanksgiving this year


389
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.520
and the grandkids
are counting on it.


390
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.860
So, please, keep it
on the hush-hush.


391
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.400
Hush-hush?

392
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.110
Some of the other ladies in the
building have been begging for


393
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.740
a spot on the hotline for years,
bribing me with baked goods.


394
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.490
Don't want the
gravy train to stop.


395
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.160
Got me?
But, Margaret...


396
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.250
That's right.

397
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.920
I need a sub
starting today.


398
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.960
I need you!

399
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.720
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.


400
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.930
Yeah, Margaret told me you
were very enthusiastic


401
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.720
about taking
the job.


402
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.890
Well, actually I only
agreed because she seemed


403
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.810
so terribly
desperate.


404
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:16.650
That's rich.

405
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.020
Oh, Margaret said
you were a ringer.


406
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.980
And for a Brit, it seems
like you really know your way


407
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.690
around a
Thanksgiving turkey.


408
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.990
Thanks, Roger.

409
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.450
My mother's
American, actually.


410
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.410
So, Thanksgiving's always
been a special time for us.


411
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.660
And we are
thankful for that!


412
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.700
Here you go.

413
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.460
Okay, it's
showtime!


414
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.500
You're live in
five, four, three...


415
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.760
Isn't that a TV thing?

416
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.590
Could you just let
me have my fun?


417
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.550
Okay.

418
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.640
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.


419
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.690
I don't know.

420
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.310
My mother-in-law told me to
keep the plastic wrapping


421
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.610
on the turkey, to
seal in the juices.


422
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.860
Does your mother-in-law,
by chance,


423
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.860
have her knickers in a knot
because you're hosting


424
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.360
Thanksgiving this
year instead of her?


425
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.320
Her what in
a what-now?


426
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.820
Oh, sorry.

427
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.620
Do you think that could be why
she's giving you bad advice?


428
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.330
Maybe.

429
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.370
I hadn't thought
of that.


430
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.630
Thank you.

431
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.020
How long does a twenty-pound
turkey take to thaw?


432
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.440
What?!

433
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.560
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.


434
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.360
Can I defrost my turkey on
the roof rack of my car?


435
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.650
I'm driving from
Kenosha to Kalamazoo.


436
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.660
Hello, are you
still there?


437
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.910
Can the electric blanket be
on 'high' all night long?


438
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.960
Pardon?

439
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.750
I'm not sure if my turkey's
going to be ready in time.


440
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.460
What state is
your turkey in?


441
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.380
Florida.

442
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.770
Oh no!

443
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.330
Is this a bad time?

444
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.950
Hmm.

445
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.170
Ahhh.

446
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.800
Yes, I am
from England.


447
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.130
Defrost in the refrigerator.

448
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.340
No, we don't do Thanksgiving
there, but I can-


449
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:56.890
Happy Thanksgiving
to you, too.


450
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.640
Turkey trouble?

451
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.350
They don't think the British
know how to cook turkey.


452
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.610
Maybe I should just
use an American accent.


453
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.480
Would make this
a lot easier.


454
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.820
You can do that?

455
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.900
Of course!

456
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.860
My mom's American.

457
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.200
Watch this.

458
00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.530
Thanks for calling
the Holiday Hotline.


459
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.740
My name is...

460
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.540
What should my
American name be?


461
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.370
What's wrong
with Abby?


462
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.830
I'm getting
into character.


463
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.880
Oh, okay.

464
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.460
Well, you're filling
for Margaret,


465
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.880
so Madge, Maggy, Peggy.

466
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.670
Peggy, perfect!

467
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.550
...Peggy.

468
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.010
Let's talk turkey.

469
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.270
Hi, um,
this is John.


470
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.020
John?

471
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.310
What?

472
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.770
That is my
given name.


473
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.520
I'm talking to
a stranger.


474
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.980
Do you let strangers
call you Mikey?


475
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.400
I never understood how
anybody gets Jack from John


476
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.700
in the first place.

477
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.370
How can I help
you today, John?


478
00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.200
Well, how much
time do you have?


479
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.620
Well, as long
as it takes.


480
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.870
So, why don't we start
at the beginning?


481
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.920
I assume you're having
turkey troubles.


482
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.590
Well, the trouble started
long before the turkey,


483
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.710
but that's a good
place to start.


484
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.260
What's the
problem?


485
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.220
Well, I have a twenty-pound
turkey and it's frozen solid.


486
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.590
Okay, sounds like
you're feeding an army.


487
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.470
When do you need it?

488
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.730
Technically for Thanksgiving,
tomorrow night.


489
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.730
But I thought
I'd start early.


490
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.310
And I don't want to
"fowl" this one up.


491
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.440
Um, sorry, that joke didn't
deserve the reaction it got.


492
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.780
Apologies.

493
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.410
Um, that was
a dad joke.


494
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.620
My daughter would
be mortified.


495
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.490
I'll allow it.

496
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.410
I bet your daughter is
proud of her father


497
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.000
for taking on the
turkey duties.


498
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.290
Yeah, well, that's the thing,
actually I'm struggling here


499
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.590
because I, I just...I want
to show her I can do this,


500
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.220
you know.

501
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.510
This is a test to see if we can
host Christmas dinner here,


502
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.680
like before.

503
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.600
Does mom usually
do the cooking?


504
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.520
She used to.

505
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.230
Oh, I'm sorry.

506
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.860
No, that's okay.

507
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.410
She, um, she's not
with us anymore.


508
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.620
I'm so sorry.

509
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.540
John?

510
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.840
John, are you
still there?


511
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.840
Yeah, um, I think I
need to go actually.


512
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.800
Sorry to waste
your time.


513
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:44.640
But I-

514
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.980
You alright?

515
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.400
Hmm?

516
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.400
Oh, yes, fine.

517
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.950
Thank you.

518
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.740
Maybe that's enough for
your first go-round.


519
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.660
Tomorrow's the big day.

520
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.410
You need your rest for
the Thanksgiving rush.


521
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.040
Thanks Roger.

522
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.740
You don't have to
do that, you know.


523
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.660
Oh, hi.

524
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.080
What are you
doing here?


525
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.210
Well, I am the one
who broke the handle.


526
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.210
I thought maybe I
could find a new one.


527
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.420
What are you
doing here?


528
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.170
Well, as my brother
pointed out,


529
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.170
I was the one who was being
prickly the other day.


530
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.630
I thought maybe replacing
your handle would be


531
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.010
a way to apologize.

532
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.720
It's okay.

533
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.640
You're passionate
about your work.


534
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.520
I get it.

535
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.730
That's crackling -
antique kitchen bits.


536
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.530
Ou, Chicago
is pricey.


537
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:19.940
I'll have to take out
a loan just to buy


538
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.700
a pack of
crisps here.


539
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.200
That's chips, right?

540
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.620
No.

541
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.200
Chips are fried
potatoes.
You mean
French fries.


542
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.200
No. The French stole the
idea from the British.


543
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.540
Uh, yeah, well of
course they did, hmm.


544
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.960
This thing's probably
got a hundred years of


545
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.420
memories baked onto it.

546
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.210
Oh, I hope not.
That's disgusting.


547
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.050
It's called seasoning.

548
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.800
That's what makes cast iron
skillets so wonderful


549
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.260
to cook with.

550
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.720
Oh.

551
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.720
Do, do you cook?

552
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.980
I choose not to.

553
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.390
Same.

554
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.980
Yeah, well, actually
people ask me not to


555
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.270
because I'm beyond
terrible at it.


556
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.570
Speaking of which,
um, I better run


557
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.900
because I have to
pick up dinner.


558
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.610
Oh, me, too.

559
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.200
I'll let you know if I
find that door handle.


560
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.990
I promise not to
break it if you do!


561
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.750
Yeah.

562
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.920
Okay, sweetie,
there you go.


563
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.420
Dad, why is there a
turkey in the bathtub?


564
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.760
Oh, um...because
he was cold.


565
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.940
Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?


566
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.900
That's already
a question.


567
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.940
Right.

568
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.280
You know that
holiday essay.


569
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.280
I saw that you started writing
about 'Opening Presents'.


570
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.070
I thought you were gonna
wait to see if I could


571
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.910
step up with
the turkey.


572
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.580
It's okay, Dad.

573
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.910
A turkey's a lot harder than
fruit and cottage cheese.


574
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.960
I thought I'd
go easy on you.


575
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.790
Hmm, okay.

576
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.630
Good night,
princess.


577
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.050
I love you.

578
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.050
Good night, Dad.
Love you more.


579
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.140
No way, kiddo.
I love you more.


580
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.570
Well, I hope you had a lovely
evening at the spa last night.


581
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.580
Round two.

582
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.660
Holiday Hotline.

583
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.920
Let's talk turkey.

584
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.670
Happy Thanksgiving!

585
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.670
And thank you for
coming in early.


586
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.670
Today is basically
our Super Bowl.


587
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.510
I'm ready, willing
and almost awake.


588
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.930
Well, this afternoon, we will
be having our own Thanksgiving,


589
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.510
even while we make
others better.


590
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.680
We're basically one
big family here.


591
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.020
It's lovely.

592
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.730
I bet everyone misses
Margaret though.


593
00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.020
Oh, well, I hear she's having
a ball with her grandkids.


594
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.900
Check this out.

595
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.860
Oh, she hasn't gotten the
hang of a selfie yet.


596
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.860
Oh!

597
00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.280
Oh, buckle up,
it's go time!


598
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.040
Holiday Hotline.

599
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.870
Let's talk turkey.

600
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.580
Is this Peggy?

601
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.790
I was hoping to
talk to Peggy.


602
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.250
Yes, this is Peggy.

603
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.720
Hi, um, this is John
from, from yesterday.


604
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.180
John.

605
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.560
Yeah, I wanted
to apologize.


606
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.850
I was, I was going through
a thing, but I'm good now.


607
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.060
Hey, don't you worry.

608
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.060
I'm really glad
you called back.


609
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.190
Yeah, this turkey deal, it's
proving to be more challenging


610
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.230
than I thought.

611
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.240
You know, more often than
not, the biggest obstacle


612
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.030
when cooking a turkey
is the emotional part.


613
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.160
The emotional part?

614
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.370
Well, it can be
intimidating.


615
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.210
There are high expectations
around the holiday turkey.


616
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.080
And that
makes sense.


617
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.210
I've been avoiding
it all morning.


618
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.880
And it is scary,
but as I mentioned,


619
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.590
it brings up a lot.

620
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.770
I, I know it's not really my
place, but if you need to talk,


621
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.640
I'm happy to listen.

622
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.560
It might help.

623
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.980
Thank you, um, that's,
that's very kind.


624
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.820
The truth is I, I probably
don't talk about it enough.


625
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.450
But it's, um, the loss
is there all the time.


626
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.750
How long ago, if you
don't mind me asking?


627
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.660
Three years.

628
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.460
I see.

629
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.460
Yeah, I'm working my way through
it, but it's my daughter.


630
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.680
I just recently realize that
having Christmas dinner at home


631
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.800
is the thing that
she misses the most.


632
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.060
Food is a powerful
connector to memories.


633
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.640
Indeed, it is.

634
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.900
I guess I, I just, I worry that
no matter how I do with this,


635
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.820
it'll never be
what it was.


636
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.190
Healing takes time.

637
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.780
I'm...I'm just
learning that myself.


638
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.830
It's hard to let go of
what we thought our life


639
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.830
was going to be.

640
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.830
Yeah.

641
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.670
Hey, you're right.

642
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.500
It's the hardest
thing there is.


643
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.840
Don't give up, John.

644
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.510
Thanksgiving is a
perfect practice run.


645
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.880
You can get all
the kinks out,


646
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.880
and be ready for the
main event on Christmas.


647
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.600
And don't worry, the hotline
will be open all the way


648
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.140
through Christmas
Eve Day.


649
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.810
And you'll be there?

650
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.350
Absolutely.

651
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.310
I can help you every
step of the way.


652
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.190
So, let's not
"fowl" it up.


653
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.610
Good one.

654
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.740
Um, thank you for
listening, means a lot.


655
00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.700
Well, then, let's
keep going.


656
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.740
I'll talk you through
the prep process.


657
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.740
I'm all ears.

658
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.580
Of course, it's
my pleasure.


659
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.540
Happy Thanksgiving, John.

660
00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.120
Hi, Mum.

661
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.000
Hi, Dad.

662
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.250
Hello, sweetheart!

663
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.710
Cheers, pet!

664
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.010
Are you eating a
microwave burrito?


665
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.510
What's wrong
with that?


666
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.050
Well, I don't think I've ever
seen you use the microwave


667
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.470
in your entire
adult life.


668
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:05.310
The act of actually cooking
just doesn't appeal right now.


669
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.730
It's no big deal.

670
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.400
So, how is
Thanksgiving in London?


671
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.190
Aces, brilliant.

672
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.230
But we missed your turkey and
your cranberry brie bites.


673
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.950
And I missed your glorious
Yorkshire pudding, of course.


674
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.410
Anyone miss me?

675
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.740
Or just my cooking?

676
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.160
Of course,
we missed you.


677
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.160
Hogwash, we're missing
you as we speak.


678
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.460
How are you
spending your time?


679
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.590
I'm, um, doing some
culinary consulting work,


680
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.090
while avoiding anyone
and anything to do with


681
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.380
the restaurant scene.

682
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.220
Oh, Abigail.

683
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.470
And I don't even want
to think about my future


684
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.100
until I get back.

685
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.600
I am on vacation from
thinking, cooking, dating,


686
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.600
and anything else ending in
"ing" that I can't think of


687
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.940
right now, because, as I said,
I am on vacation from thinking.


688
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.940
Are you
sleep-"ing"?


689
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.280
Of course.

690
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.940
Quite well,
as it happens.


691
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.490
Oh, can I
call you back?


692
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.280
Bye.

693
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.330
Bye-bye.

694
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.580
Wow.

695
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.500
You don't waste
any time, do you?


696
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.090
Oh, we take Christmas very
seriously around here.


697
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.050
And not just the
turkey dinner part.


698
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.090
Which I hear was
going very well.


699
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.390
And here's
your wreath.


700
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.470
Oh, so this is an
official thing?


701
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.350
Yep. Everyone
decorates their own.


702
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.640
There's a "best
door décor" prize.


703
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.150
Which I
intend to win.


704
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.070
What's the prize?

705
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.610
The prize is lording
it over Carla in 32.


706
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.570
Well, I can't wait
to get started.


707
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.320
Is there somewhere
close by with Christmas


708
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.160
bits and bobs
I can use?


709
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.580
Okay, you are just
adorable with that accent.


710
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.660
There's a wonderful
little Christmas shop


711
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.160
a couple of blocks down.

712
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.330
It's a really good
gift shop, too.


713
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.500
You know, in case you wanted to
bring something back to London


714
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.380
for your boyfriend?

715
00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.840
Or girlfriend?

716
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.800
Or miscellaneous
significant other?


717
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.260
None of the above.

718
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.430
But the shop
sounds lovely.


719
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.140
You know, Mike and I are headed
out to get a Christmas tree


720
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.600
if you want
to tag along.


721
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.520
And we won't be long 'cause
I've got to work tonight.


722
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.520
I don't think I'll be
getting a tree this year.


723
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.560
Decorating the wreath
is enough for me.


724
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.150
It's for the
main lobby.


725
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.400
We have a little tree
trimming party and everyone


726
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.030
puts one personal
ornament on it.


727
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.950
Something that
represents who they are.


728
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.240
You should come.

729
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.080
** We Wish You a
Merry Christmas *


730
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.210
* We Wish You a Merry
Christmas *


731
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.040
* We Wish You a Merry
Christmas and a... *


732
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.250
I'll be right back.

733
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.670
* ...Happy New Year *

734
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.210
* Good tidings we bring
to you and your king **


735
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.760
Don't you look lovely.

736
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.130
Merry Christmas.

737
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.590
What do you think?

738
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.680
Well, it's a bit
wobbly for the middle.


739
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720
Hi Jack!

740
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.140
Hey, Jessica.

741
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.060
Fancy meeting
you two here.


742
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.940
But you two asked
us to meet you.


743
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.400
We did?

744
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.560
What's going
on with her?


745
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.360
Going?

746
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.570
On?

747
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.690
You, too?

748
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.830
Oh.

749
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.580
What?

750
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.200
It's not
about you.


751
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.370
She wants to experience a
full-fledged American Christmas,


752
00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:17.290
and that always
involves buying a tree!


753
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.460
Yeah.

754
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.460
Hi, Jack.

755
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.050
Happy
Day-After-Thanksgiving.


756
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.420
I think you mean
Black Friday.


757
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.340
But I'm, I'm guessing you
don't have that in England


758
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.100
because you don't
have Thanksgiving.


759
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.350
Actually, we do
have Black Friday.


760
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:33.600
Oh, I didn't
know that.


761
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.430
Commerce prevails!

762
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.190
And we also have
Taupe Tuesday.


763
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.310
But it's
kind of boring.


764
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.360
Because taupe is
a boring color.


765
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.940
It's not a
real thing.


766
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.490
I realize that's a mercy
laugh, but I'll take it.


767
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.120
It's not a mercy laugh,
but all Taupe Tuesday.


768
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.250
Yeah, that's a Jack
joke all day long.


769
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.330
It's like a dad
joke, just way worse.


770
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.130
He's probably jealous he
didn't come up with it.


771
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.380
Oh, thank you, Mike.

772
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.050
Oh, this is my
daughter, Jessica.


773
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.090
Jessica, this is Abby.

774
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.220
She's from
London, England.


775
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.470
Like Harry Potter?

776
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.510
Oh, Harry and
I go way back.


777
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.600
He's a fictional
character from a book.


778
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.520
Smart kid.

779
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.190
Yeah, sometimes too smart
for her own good, huh?


780
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.480
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Jessica.


781
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.570
I was going to get some hot
cocoa if you'd like some?


782
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.160
Can I?

783
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.490
Sure, yeah.

784
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.330
All right,
come with me.


785
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.130
What's the matter?

786
00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.250
Something
wrong with it?


787
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.840
Whipped cream always
melts too fast.


788
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.550
I have a special
trick for that.


789
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.720
Hang on.

790
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.010
Excuse me,
strange request.


791
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.930
What is she doing?

792
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.220
Thank you very much.

793
00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.270
Alright, take a sip.

794
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.570
And another one.

795
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.650
And one more.

796
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.330
Come on, guys, let's
go find a good tree.


797
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.250
No, you have to use
a meat thermometer.


798
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.170
There are lots of ways
to prepare a turkey.


799
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.220
You're so welcome.

800
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.550
Make sure you let the turkey
rest for twenty minutes.


801
00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.720
You can do it.

802
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.430
Deglaze the pan?

803
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.600
So, am I supposed to take
it to, like, a body shop?


804
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.390
Holiday Hotline.

805
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.770
Let's talk turkey.

806
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.150
Yeah, all I want to
know is how do I wake up


807
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.270
a turkey after it rests, huh?

808
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.650
What do I,
give it a slap?


809
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.690
I mean it's already
dead, am I right?


810
00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.610
Just tell it to wake
up and you'll be fine.


811
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.200
Merry Christmas.

812
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.660
Hey, not so fast.

813
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.460
Something tells me
that you know too much.


814
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.460
About how to make a delicious
cheese cake for dessert.


815
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.790
Huh?

816
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.090
Oh, oh, yes, I do.

817
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.390
The secret is
cottage cheese.


818
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.770
Your secret's safe with me.

819
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.900
Yes.

820
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.320
Holiday Hotline.

821
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.030
Let's talk turkey.

822
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.530
He-he-he-hum.

823
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.280
We have a caller
looking for Peggy.


824
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.450
It's John.

825
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.790
Does he always sound this
eager to talk to you?


826
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.370
I hadn't noticed.

827
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.130
You know when you lie, Santa
takes you off the nice list.


828
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.800
It's Father
Christmas.


829
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.460
I'm British,
remember?


830
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:56.640
Maybe I should tell John I'm
not really Peggy, or American.


831
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.550
No, you can't do that.
Why not?


832
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.510
Well, because he
opened up to you.


833
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.470
He, he was vulnerable with you,
and if he thinks you're just


834
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.270
playing games with him, well
he'll feel like a fool,


835
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.400
and he may never call
the hotline again.


836
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.980
He'll be too
embarrassed.


837
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.570
You're right.

838
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.530
I don't want him to think I
didn't take his call seriously.


839
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.490
As a turkey
expert, I mean.


840
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.240
Oh, yes, of course.

841
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.370
And the other callers
have been responding


842
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.200
to me better as Peggy.

843
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.830
There you go.

844
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.750
Peggy lives! Ha-ha.

845
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.000
Line two.

846
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.930
Hi, John.

847
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.510
Hi, Peggy.

848
00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.560
It's good to
hear from you.


849
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.100
How did
Thanksgiving go?


850
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.730
Well, I followed
your advice to a T,


851
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.820
except for the part about taking
it out of the oven on time.


852
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.530
Oh, no.
Yeah.


853
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.860
Anyway, my family had a
back-up turkey ready to go.


854
00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.740
And I wasn't sure whether I
should be grateful or insulted.


855
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.080
Well, then there's
nowhere to go but up.


856
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.750
You still have time to
do another test turkey.


857
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.750
Well, that's actually
why I'm calling.


858
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.880
But now I'm
second-guessing myself.


859
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.840
Nope. You called.

860
00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.420
We're doing this.

861
00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.710
So, how many people would
you be serving on Christmas?


862
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.550
Five to seven.

863
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.010
My parents haven't decided if
they're going to Florida yet.


864
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.970
So maybe more
left overs.


865
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.100
I'd recommend a
twelve pounder.
Oh, okay.


866
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.440
To brine or not to brine,
that is the question!


867
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.190
Definitely brine.

868
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.570
It locks in so
much of the flavor.


869
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.950
Once it's thawed, call me
back, and we'll go from there.


870
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.030
Okay, but what if you're
not there when I call?


871
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.540
Well, everyone
here is an expert.


872
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.120
Yeah, I know, but I mean,
you know my whole...deal.


873
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.710
You know I'm still a little bit
embarrassed that I spilled


874
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.590
my guts like
that the other day.


875
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.960
Don't be.

876
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.130
Sometimes it takes talking
to someone you don't know


877
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.880
to really talk turkey.

878
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.970
Sorry, bad joke.

879
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.600
I am full of
those lately.


880
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.180
No, no, no.

881
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.810
You're right, because I know,
like, once I get through this,


882
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.310
everything
else is gravy.


883
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.480
Okay, that is
so much worse.


884
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:21.530
Seriously though, if you do
want to make sure to get me


885
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.240
on the line, this week I'm here
from noon to eight central time.


886
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.120
Perfect.

887
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.910
I'm on the central
time zone, too.


888
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.660
Chicago.

889
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.920
That's where I am.

890
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.840
For some reason you
sound really far away.


891
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.260
Oh, yeah, that's, that's because
my daughter spilt a little bit


892
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.130
of orange juice
on my cell phone.


893
00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.050
You know, like
a gallon or so.


894
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.970
Well, that
would do it.


895
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.260
Yeah.

896
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.770
Okay, so just
to be clear,


897
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:51.310
call back sometime this
week noon 'til eight?
Yeah.


898
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:55.650
All right, it's a
date...for talking turkey,


899
00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.030
about actual turkey, not that
turkeys can talk that's...
Right.


900
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.740
Right, okay,
we'll talk then.
Bye.


901
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.160
Bye.

902
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.420
He lives in Chicago!

903
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.800
Blimey, were you
eavesdropping?


904
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.130
Uh, yeah.

905
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.550
This is my new
favorite show.


906
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.600
It's The Love Birds
with Peggy and John!


907
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.970
It's The Love
Birds with Peggy and John.


908
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.560
The Love Birds with
Peggy and John.


909
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.850
I just made that up.

910
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.030
Hey, want
to grab lunch?


911
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.700
I need a
twelve-pound turkey.


912
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.990
For lunch?

913
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.240
Seems excessive.

914
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.120
To try and make
at home, again.


915
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.950
What changed
your mind?


916
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.540
Seeing Jess have so much
fun at the tree lot.


917
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.750
She still loves
Christmas so much.


918
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.130
I owe it to her.

919
00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.630
Plus, Peggy from the
Hotline is gonna help me.


920
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.010
Who-who really?

921
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:04.340
Okay, new topic.

922
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.760
Okay.

923
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.550
Seemed like you and Abby
hit it off at the tree lot.


924
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.930
Why are you so determined
to pair me up with someone?


925
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.600
Because at some point, you
have to stop living in the past


926
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.350
and start thinking
about the future.


927
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.610
It's kind of hard to do when
my entire career is literally


928
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.070
all about the past.

929
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:24.150
Uh, our job is about honoring
it, not clinging to it.


930
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.530
And you know I wasn't
talking about work.


931
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.190
If you were planning on
breaking and entering,


932
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.860
you're doing it wrong.

933
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.030
I should've knocked.

934
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.200
This probably
looks creepy, huh?


935
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.820
If we hadn't already
met, definitely.


936
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.950
But since we've already
met...still creepy.


937
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.790
Yeah.

938
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.830
So, you found
the match.


939
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.370
All that angst
for nothing.


940
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:17.830
Yeah, I thought so.

941
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.830
But the holes
don't line up.


942
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.960
So, make new holes.

943
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.670
Whoa, are you insane?

944
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.840
I can't just drill
into this door.


945
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.180
It's more, it's more
precious than the handle!


946
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.970
And...I'm doing it
again, aren't I?


947
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.980
A little bit.

948
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.230
Yeah.

949
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.690
So, I shouldn't hammer a
large nail into the door


950
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.650
to hang my wreath?

951
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.150
You're killing me.

952
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.070
You don't have
a door hanger?


953
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.490
Wouldn't
you know it?


954
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.200
The one thing I
forgot to pack.


955
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.530
Right.

956
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.280
Okay, give me
ten minutes.


957
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.540
Don't touch
the door, okay.


958
00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.710
I think the Christmas
shop around the corner


959
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.210
probably has something.

960
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.790
Oh, I was going to
go there myself.


961
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.340
I need an ornament for the
building's tree-trimming party.


962
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.300
What's wrong?

963
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.050
You, you just reminded
me I haven't done the tree


964
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.880
with my kid.

965
00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.930
My wife was much more
organized about these things.


966
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.140
Was?

967
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.020
Yeah, she was, yeah.

968
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

969
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.110
Oh, thank you.

970
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.980
But it's been a while.

971
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.900
Let's just get you
that hanger, huh?


972
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.740
I'll get my coat.

973
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.030
Okay.

974
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.790
It's that guy.

975
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.090
Thank you.

976
00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.710
You didn't have
to buy it for me.


977
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.920
Oh, I'm not.

978
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.970
I'm buying it for your
poor, beleaguered door.


979
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.930
Plus, I thought I'd look
for an ornament for Jess.


980
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.180
We've been getting her one every
year since she was a baby,


981
00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.260
so that way when
she grows up,


982
00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.930
she'll have a
collection of her own.


983
00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.810
There, just at
the back here.


984
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.770
Oh, this is perfect.

985
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.780
Jessica started playing guitar
this year, and by playing,


986
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.570
I mean not playing
any actual chords,


987
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.860
but fully committing to
the rock star aesthetic.


988
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.950
Pa-little-little-la.

989
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.780
I think you missed
your calling.


990
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.580
Alright, your turn.

991
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.960
Okay.

992
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.580
Well, the ornament for the
lobby tree is supposed to be


993
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.920
something that
represents each of us.


994
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.380
Mm-hmm.

995
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.220
I think this is me more than
anything else right now.


996
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.310
You're sparkly
and overpriced?


997
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.140
I was going for multifaceted
and unpredictable.


998
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.480
Wow.

999
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.900
You're incredibly
self-aware.


1000
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.860
Ha!

1001
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.030
"For the multifaceted and
unpredictable person


1002
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.990
in your life, who lights
up every room they're in."


1003
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.780
Huh, you skipped
that last part.


1004
00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:59.160
I'm British.

1005
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.830
We walk into a room and
deliberately avoid


1006
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.500
attracting attention.

1007
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.830
Hmm, so I shouldn't do
something like this?


1008
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.840
Hey! Holiday Shoppers!

1009
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.210
This here is Abby,

1010
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.010
and she is visiting Chicago
all the way from London!


1011
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.010
Can we get a
Merry Christmas?


1012
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.760
Shoppers: Merry Christmas!

1013
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.850
That's just cruel.

1014
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.860
Well, thank you for
the unwanted attention.


1015
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.280
And the wreath hanger.

1016
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.150
Thank you for not destroying
any more of your apartment.


1017
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.530
So, you're back
to that, huh?


1018
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.620
Oh, I never left.

1019
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.170
Think I have everything I
need for Operation Turkey.


1020
00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:47.580
Hope I'm up to it.

1021
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.670
Don't worry, I've made an
extra-large pot of tea today,


1022
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.630
so I'm here as long
as you need me.


1023
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.210
I'm serious.
I can't mess this up.


1024
00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.800
There's only two
weeks 'til Christmas.


1025
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.010
Hey, don't put so much
pressure on yourself.


1026
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.050
Have some fun.

1027
00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:59.550
People have
fun doing this?


1028
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.220
Of course,
you'll see.


1029
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.520
Once you get the hang of it,
you start making it your own.


1030
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.100
That's the
joy of cooking.


1031
00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.560
Or at least it
was for me once.


1032
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.400
Oh, but not anymore?

1033
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.230
I...I love it.

1034
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.780
But, right now
talking about it,


1035
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.200
it's less painful
than actually doing it.


1036
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.820
It's complicated.

1037
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.740
Try me.

1038
00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.830
Okay.

1039
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.660
My entire identity was wrapped
up in my cooking career...


1040
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.580
and in a former
relationship.


1041
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.590
Those two worlds were more mixed
than they should have been.


1042
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.840
Anyway, he was never
honest with me.


1043
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.930
In fact, he...he was
lying to me all along.


1044
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.930
I'm sorry that you had
to go through that.


1045
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.470
I've dealt with my fair
share of lies, too.


1046
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.100
But, um,
please, go on.


1047
00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.150
No, you go ahead.

1048
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.940
Well, um, it was
my late wife.


1049
00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.200
She kept her illness
a secret for a while.


1050
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.110
Even from me.

1051
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.820
I know she did
it to protect me.


1052
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.540
But, look, we don't
have to get into that.


1053
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.080
I'd like to hear more about
you, if you feel open to it.


1054
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.210
Well, the long and short
of it is I broke it off


1055
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:15.920
and haven't wanted to go
back to anything like that.


1056
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.630
I just wanted to see what
it was like to do something


1057
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.170
else for a while.

1058
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.720
Hmm.

1059
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.510
So, you took a job that's
literally all about cooking?


1060
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.060
This is different.

1061
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.560
This is me helping people
find the joy I once had.


1062
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.150
Right now, it's enough.

1063
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:36.110
Ha, I'm not convinced I'll ever
put the word joy in cooking


1064
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.820
in the same sentence.

1065
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.070
Well, then let's start with
not miserable and cooking.


1066
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.740
I can help.

1067
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.160
You just have
to trust me.


1068
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.830
I do trust you.

1069
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.950
Even though
we've never met.


1070
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.040
Which is...weird.

1071
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.870
But a good weird.

1072
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.880
A great weird.

1073
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.590
Okay, you have
to meet this guy.


1074
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.760
And live a lie
in real life?


1075
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.510
That's the last
thing John needs.


1076
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.930
Believe me.

1077
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.510
Well, I am still rooting
for Peggy and John.


1078
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.470
I said The Love
Birds, Peggy and John.


1079
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.730
Love Birds,
Peggy and John.


1080
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.230
The Love Birds,
Peggy and John.


1081
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.860
I'm excited to see what
you made for the potluck!


1082
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.280
Which dish is yours?

1083
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.330
I made a trip to the market
and bought a baked brie.


1084
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:31.330
You're really committed to
this no cooking thing, huh?


1085
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:33.710
I am, and
it's liberating.


1086
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.250
Did you hang your
ornament on the tree?


1087
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.880
Oh, I almost forgot.

1088
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.840
Pretty.
Thanks.


1089
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.680
Boring.
Hey!


1090
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.550
I wanted to get the
roast turkey ornament,


1091
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.850
but I didn't want anyone
getting suspicious.


1092
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.310
Good thinking!

1093
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.890
So, which
ornament is yours?


1094
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.730
It's an
old-fashioned!


1095
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.810
Get it?

1096
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.150
'Cause I'm old.

1097
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.440
And you like fashion?

1098
00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.610
No, because I like
to drink them.


1099
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.780
There you are!

1100
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.910
I hope you don't mind,
I dragged jack here with me.


1101
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.910
I wouldn't
say "dragged".


1102
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.330
Did you two
bring ornaments?


1103
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:17.420
Compasses.

1104
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.300
Because we're
architects.


1105
00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.840
Yeah, and the T-squares
were too big.


1106
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.760
Mine's a turkey foot!

1107
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.550
A what?!

1108
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.220
It's the little thingy that
holds IV tubes together.


1109
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.930
Winner-winner,
turkey dinner!


1110
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.980
Hang it up.

1111
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.480
Lights up every room.

1112
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.270
I'm British, remember.

1113
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.570
Yeah.

1114
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.320
Say Christmas crackers

1115
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.240
All: Christmas crackers.

1116
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.080
Alright, who moved
the mistletoe?


1117
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.580
I may need that!

1118
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.160
I really want to be
her when I grow old.


1119
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.710
Oh, we all do.

1120
00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:00.040
So, Abby, have you gone to the
Christmaskindle market yet?


1121
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.250
We're all going
tomorrow night.


1122
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.760
Oh, I'm dying to go,
but I have to work.


1123
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.670
Oh, I didn't realize you were
working while you were here.


1124
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.970
I just thought you were
out sightseeing every day.


1125
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:09.300
What do you do?

1126
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.310
Oh, just some free
lance...consulting.


1127
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.480
But aren't you working
at the hospital tomorrow?


1128
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.310
My shift doesn't
start 'til 11.


1129
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.350
You must be
knackered.


1130
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.730
When do you sleep?

1131
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:20.770
Sleep?

1132
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.480
What's that?

1133
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.690
Abby, come with me.

1134
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.320
I want to
introduce to someone.


1135
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.160
Okay. Bye.

1136
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.320
Nice save.

1137
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:30.780
Need to keep the
gravy train chugging.


1138
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.990
Choo-choo!

1139
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.680
Oh, there's a lot you
can do with leftovers.


1140
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.550
Oh, turkey meatballs,
turkey enchiladas.


1141
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.350
My father used to make the best
turkey samosas around town.


1142
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.720
Turkey pozole,
turkey croquettes.


1143
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.390
Turkey tetrazzini, turkey
enchilada, turkey ramen,


1144
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.940
turkey Caesar salad, turkey
Reuben, turkey chili,


1145
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.610
turkey burgers, smoky turkey
corn chowder, turkey hash.


1146
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.520
You should hang
up and call 911.


1147
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.150
This is Peggy, now
let's talk turkey.


1148
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.530
Hi!

1149
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:12.370
So, I'm lookin' at
a turkey from 1999,


1150
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:14.540
sitting here in my
granny's freezer.


1151
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.700
Margaret, is that you?

1152
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:17.710
Who's this?

1153
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.160
It's Abby.

1154
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.040
But you said Peggy.

1155
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.540
Where's your accent?

1156
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.920
Are you even British?

1157
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.460
I am, Margaret.

1158
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.720
I just decided to use an
American accent for the hotline.


1159
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.840
You don't really have a

1160
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.680
No.

1161
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.390
I was just trying to keep
you all on your toes.


1162
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:38.310
I've enjoyed spending so
much time with my grandkids,


1163
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.390
but I miss my
hotline family.


1164
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.310
They miss you, too.

1165
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:45.570
Maybe I could fill in
for you here and there?


1166
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.900
You know, in case there's
something you want to do


1167
00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.320
while you're in Chicago?

1168
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.820
Say, go the
Christmas Market?


1169
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:58.080
It's a Chicago tradition,
which I'm sure you'll enjoy.


1170
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.370
** Deck the hall with
boughs of holly *


1171
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.790
* Fa la la la
la, la la la **

1172
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.710
So, what do you think of
Christmas in Chicago, Abby?


1173
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.670
I imagine you prefer
more of a Dicken's vibe.


1174
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.010
Did you just
say vibe?


1175
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.800
Yeah, so what,
I'm hip.


1176
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.390
Even worse.

1177
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.220
It's a lot different
from London,


1178
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.390
but I really like it.

1179
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.810
And the architecture
in Chicago is stunning.


1180
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.440
I truly had no idea how
beautiful it is here.


1181
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.440
Have on done the
Burnham walk yet?


1182
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.270
The Burnham walk?

1183
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.570
Oh, it's Jack's
favorite area.


1184
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.780
It's not really
an official thing,


1185
00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.860
but an area with
gorgeous architecture.


1186
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.490
We can take her to
Mike's for the night.


1187
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.200
Yeah, why you
deserve a night out.


1188
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.370
Can I dad?

1189
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.790
Please.

1190
00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:43.460
You sure?

1191
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.250
Come on, Jack, I made an excuse
to watch my episodes of Bloomy.


1192
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.500
It is a great show.

1193
00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.210
Okay, thanks, guys.

1194
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.630
I'll pick you up first
thing in the morning, okay?
Okay.


1195
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.970
I love you so much.
I love you more.


1196
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.560
I think they're leaving
us alone on purpose.


1197
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.020
A hundred percent.

1198
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.440
That historic route's
only a five-minute walk.


1199
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.480
Shall we?

1200
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.900
We shall.

1201
00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.410
So, that architecture was
greatly influenced by


1202
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.700
Daniel
Burnham's work.


1203
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.620
Sort of a
hero of mine.


1204
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.160
His designs are
timeless, classic.


1205
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.830
My apartment building is
a similar style, right?


1206
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.590
Yes!

1207
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.170
Dates back to
Burnham's time.
Okay.


1208
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.300
Now your whole door reaction
makes a lot more sense.


1209
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.680
Thanks.

1210
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.800
We're just trying to
preserve a part of the past,


1211
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:40.100
and stop developers
from tearing it all down


1212
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.470
and starting
from scratch.


1213
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.430
I can understand
the temptation.


1214
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.230
It's probably easier.

1215
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.310
To be honest, I think
I've been trying to do that


1216
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.860
with my life lately.

1217
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.740
Start over
from scratch.


1218
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.360
Is that why you
left London?


1219
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.870
Yes.

1220
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.830
Too much history
and heartache.


1221
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:05.330
Now thinking instead of tearing
everything down and throwing


1222
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:09.960
it away, maybe I should restore
the parts that were beautiful.


1223
00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:14.420
Did I tell you
I was a chef?


1224
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.510
You told me you
choose not to cook.


1225
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.470
So, you can
see my dilemma.


1226
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:23.560
I wish I'd known you
were a chef earlier.


1227
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.890
You probably could
have helped me.


1228
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.350
With what?

1229
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.270
Oh, um, been trying to make a
turkey for Christmas dinner,


1230
00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.270
for Jessica.

1231
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:37.240
Her mother used to do it, but
we haven't since she passed.


1232
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.830
I can't believe I'm
gonna tell you this.


1233
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.790
You don't have to tell me
anything you don't want to.


1234
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.250
Just promise
not to judge me.


1235
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.540
But I actually called that
Holiday Hotline for help.


1236
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.540
Well, let's
talk turkey!


1237
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.420
I know, it's
crazy, right?


1238
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.760
The thing is the woman
on the phone...


1239
00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.760
she, she actually
really helped me.


1240
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.850
Yeah, in more
ways than one.


1241
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.480
You alright?

1242
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.890
Sorry.

1243
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.610
I...I think I had too
much of that spiced wine.


1244
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.530
I should probably
just go home.


1245
00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:15.650
Yeah, that stuff
gets me, too.


1246
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:16.820
I can, I
can take you.


1247
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.530
No, thanks,
I'm fine.


1248
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:20.240
Taxi!

1249
00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:23.280
Are you sure
you're okay?


1250
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:28.540
Oh, thanks for the tour,
and everything you shared.


1251
00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.790
Means a lot to me.

1252
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:33.250
More than you know.

1253
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.210
Good night.

1254
00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:36.550
Good night.

1255
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.310
Good gravy,
John is Jack?


1256
00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:52.270
Are you, are
you kidding?


1257
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:53.440
I wish I were
kidding.


1258
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.650
I don't know
what to do.


1259
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:56.530
I should have told him
right then and there.


1260
00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.150
Why didn't
I tell him?


1261
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:59.360
Okay, let me
ask you this.


1262
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.610
Which one of them do
you have feelings for?


1263
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.030
Both.
And who does Jack
have feelings for?


1264
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.410
I think both, too!

1265
00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.030
Oh, that's the problem!

1266
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:05.990
He's gonna call
the hotline!


1267
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.200
I don't know
what to do.


1268
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.250
He trusts Peggy.
You're Peggy.


1269
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.370
No, I'm Abby.

1270
00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.880
He can't handle a lie like
this, I know that now.


1271
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.000
Not after everything
he's been through.


1272
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.170
When he finds
out I'm Peggy,


1273
00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.300
he's not going to trust
either of us again.


1274
00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.430
We'll both lose him.

1275
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.470
Again, you're,
you're both you.


1276
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.270
Maybe when he calls, I
just shouldn't answer.


1277
00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:33.440
Oh, well, I thought this hotline
was about turkeys, not chickens.


1278
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.230
Alright then, I'm going
to answer his call,


1279
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.240
help him make
that turkey,


1280
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.110
and then put
everything on the table.


1281
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.040
So, you're telling me you're
torn between a random voice


1282
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:56.250
on a phone, and an actual,
real-life, amazing woman?


1283
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.670
Yes.

1284
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.420
Peggy helped me
open up again.


1285
00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.590
She helped me realize
that I could move on.


1286
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.260
Yeah, but isn't Abby
doing that, too?


1287
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.590
Yeah, but it's
different.


1288
00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.470
I'm not even sure that Abby
wants whatever this is.


1289
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:07.760
Come on, I've seen the
two of you together.


1290
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.430
You have a real
connection.


1291
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.270
I have one with
Peggy, too.
Yeah.


1292
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.100
That's just over a
phone line though.


1293
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.980
Is that enough
for you?


1294
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:18.440
You're right.

1295
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.860
I need to know if what I
have with Peggy is real.


1296
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.780
I'll call her tomorrow,
make the turkey,


1297
00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.280
then I'll lay it
all on the line.


1298
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.270
Thank you for calling
the Holiday Hotline.


1299
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.520
Let's talk turkey!

1300
00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.320
Hi, Peggy.
John, hi.


1301
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.190
Ready to make
some turkey?


1302
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:04.360
More than ready.

1303
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.110
Me, too.

1304
00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.330
** La-la-la, la-la-la *

1305
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:12.160
* music *

1306
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.160
* Hey, yeah *

1307
00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:20.500
* I never knew the
meaning of Christmas *


1308
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:26.380
* ‘till you came into my life *

1309
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.890
* I was lost in the dark *

1310
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.850
* ‘till you opened my heart *

1311
00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:37.730
* Like an angel shining bright *

1312
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:40.650
* I wished on a star *

1313
00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:42.020
* And girl here you are *

1314
00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.190
Let's not let this
moment go to baste.


1315
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.030
* Suddenly I realize **

1316
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.530
What?
Let's not let this
moment go to baste.


1317
00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:49.870
Get it?

1318
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:50.740
Get it?

1319
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.910
Sorry, um,
dad joke again.


1320
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:58.370
Because baste
rhymes with...
Waste...I get it.


1321
00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.540
I didn't realize,

1322
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.210
but I guess that one was
a real thinker, huh?


1323
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.050
I'm certainly
in thought.


1324
01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:05.590
Listen, I need-
John, I need
to tell you.


1325
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.590
Cocoa emergency!

1326
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:12.050
Like Abby does it!

1327
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.720
Pleeease?

1328
01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.100
Peggy, could I call
you back in five?


1329
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.190
So, how did it go?

1330
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.150
The bird is
in the oven.


1331
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.700
Is that code?

1332
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.820
No, it's actually
in the oven.
Oh.


1333
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:33.740
We never got to
talk about anything.


1334
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.410
He's going to call me
back in five minutes.


1335
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.120
It's Jack.

1336
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.250
How did he
get my number?


1337
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:41.540
Who cares.
Answer it.


1338
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.420
Hello?

1339
01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.260
Abby, hi, it's Jack.

1340
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.340
Erica gave me
your number.


1341
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.300
I hope that's okay.

1342
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.180
Sure, of course.

1343
01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.100
I wanted to check on
you after last night.


1344
01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.680
Oh, I'm fine.

1345
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.900
Thank you.

1346
01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.940
Sorry I left
so quickly.


1347
01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980
That's okay.

1348
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.690
So, you're
feeling better?


1349
01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.240
Uh-huh.

1350
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.860
Good.

1351
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.280
Um, listen I have a turkey in
the oven and I'd really love it


1352
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:17.950
if you could come over
and try it when it's done.


1353
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
You want me
to taste it?


1354
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.130
Well, yeah, um,
you're a chef, right?


1355
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.170
Yes, but so is-

1356
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.210
Yes.

1357
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.130
I just, I just want to see
if you think it's good.


1358
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.140
There's not a doubt in
my mind that it will be.


1359
01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.720
So, you'll come?

1360
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.470
I'd love to.

1361
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.560
I have a lot
to tell you.


1362
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.020
Me, too.

1363
01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.650
I'll text you
the address.


1364
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.990
Gobble, gobble, it's
the Holiday Hotline.


1365
01:01:55.030 --> 01:02:00.040
Yes, between noon
and eight p.m.


1366
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.500
Well, I will, I
will let her know.


1367
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.210
Okay, bye.

1368
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.880
It's been
fifteen minutes.


1369
01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.470
Why hasn't John
called Peggy back?
Abby.


1370
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.390
Is he ghosting her?

1371
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:19.350
You're asking if the guy that
just asked you to his house


1372
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:21.310
is ghosting you?

1373
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:24.230
I just really wanted
closure with John first.


1374
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.610
Well, that's, that's
not gonna happen today.


1375
01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:29.020
That was John.

1376
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.490
He wanted to leave Peggy, you, a
message that he would call her,


1377
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:37.320
you, on the Hotline tomorrow,
and tell her, you, how it went.


1378
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:39.540
How it went
with the turkey?


1379
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.450
Or you.

1380
01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.370
So, Peggy's
his backup?


1381
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.590
You're jealous
of yourself?


1382
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.340
I know,
it's insane.


1383
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.730
Hey, come on in.

1384
01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:06.560
Thanks.

1385
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.730
Um, I brought
this for you.


1386
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.400
Oh, thank you.

1387
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.940
It smells really
good in here, Jack.


1388
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.740
I think you did it!

1389
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.820
Well, we'll see.

1390
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.030
Hey, Abby!

1391
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:18.490
Happy Christmas, Abby!

1392
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.030
Jessica!

1393
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.700
Oh, in case we have
hot cocoa later.


1394
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.580
Thank you.

1395
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.750
Can we, dad?

1396
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:27.580
Absolutely.

1397
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.880
Oh, there's
the timer.


1398
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
The turkey!

1399
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.670
Moment of truth.

1400
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:34.920
Oh, don't forget to let
it rest for 20 minutes.


1401
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:36.720
To let the
juices settle.


1402
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.430
Wow, look at you and
your turkey know-how.


1403
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:39.640
You probably could have worked
at that Holiday Hotline


1404
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.890
I called, huh?

1405
01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.010
Ha! Right?

1406
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.520
No, that's...

1407
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.770
Sorry, what
was that?


1408
01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.480
Nothing.

1409
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:51.940
You did it, Dad!

1410
01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.030
Well, we don't
know that yet.


1411
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:55.950
I'm nervous.

1412
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:58.110
What if it's dry?

1413
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.700
Only one way
to find out.


1414
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.080
Okay, on three.

1415
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.000
One, two, three.

1416
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.670
Mmm.

1417
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.630
It's so good!

1418
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:16.880
Brilliant!

1419
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.930
Now we can have Christmas
dinner here, right?


1420
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:21.640
Absolutely.

1421
01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.810
Um, would you
want to join us?


1422
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:27.810
I mean I, I know you don't have
any family here and my parents,


1423
01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.810
they decided to go to
Florida early this year.


1424
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.310
So, it's just gonna
be Erica and Mike.


1425
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.820
And me!

1426
01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.780
Oh, right, obviously.

1427
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.820
We're having Christmas
dinner at home, yes!


1428
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:45.040
It, it wouldn't
be like a date.


1429
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.450
Unless you
wanted it to be.


1430
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.160
But it, it
doesn't have to be.


1431
01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:53.000
Look, um, I
should stop talking.


1432
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.090
I'd love to come.

1433
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.550
Is this okay?

1434
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:05.810
Very, but...
it's just...


1435
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:07.350
Too soon?

1436
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:10.020
It's complicated.
Right.


1437
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.980
It is for me, too.

1438
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.530
I just need a little more
time to figure things out.


1439
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:19.900
Is this the, um, the
thing back in London?


1440
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.450
Not really, no, um.

1441
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:27.790
Okay, but whatever
it is, I can wait.


1442
01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.040
Did you tell that I,
I browned the turkey?


1443
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.540
Absolutely.

1444
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.440
Hey, Jack.

1445
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.770
Party's in here.

1446
01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:53.900
Are you coming?

1447
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.900
I'll be right there.

1448
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.810
I just have to
make a call first.


1449
01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.610
Okay, well, don't
take too long.


1450
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.570
Rum balls are
almost gone.


1451
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.090
John on line four.

1452
01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:20.760
All right then.

1453
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800
This is it.

1454
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.970
Hi, John.

1455
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:27.930
How was
the turkey?


1456
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:31.600
Perfect,
thanks to you.


1457
01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.060
But, um, that's not
really why I'm calling.


1458
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.570
Ah, I don't know
where to start.


1459
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:42.030
Then I'll start.

1460
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:43.610
No.

1461
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:45.070
I have to
get this out.


1462
01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:52.750
I wanted to call you one
last time and say thank you.


1463
01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:55.790
You have no idea what a
difference you've made


1464
01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:58.460
in my life.

1465
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.960
You made me realize
that I was ready.


1466
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.970
To make a turkey?

1467
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:09.510
That...and to open
my heart again.


1468
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.440
I've met
someone, Peggy.


1469
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.480
Um, someone I,
I really like.


1470
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.030
For the first time
in a long time.


1471
01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:24.900
That's wonderful.

1472
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:30.240
I know that you and I had
a connection, too, but...


1473
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.750
You don't have
to explain, John.


1474
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.880
I really enjoyed
our talks.


1475
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.670
But...I have to tell
you the truth.


1476
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.430
I'm not who
you think I am.


1477
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.850
Oh, hey.

1478
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:55.560
I don't care what you look
like, or where you come from,


1479
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.480
or, or any of that.

1480
01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.860
You know, to me,
you'll always be Peggy,


1481
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.110
the beautiful voice on
the phone who helped me


1482
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.030
open my heart again.

1483
01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:09.700
That's all that matters.

1484
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.660
Merry Christmas, Peggy.

1485
01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:21.630
And, um...thank you
again, for everything.


1486
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.630
Merry Christmas, John.

1487
01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:44.360
So, what happened?

1488
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.110
He let Peggy go.

1489
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:51.490
Well, maybe it's time
you let her go, too.


1490
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:53.780
It's up to Abby
to come clean.


1491
01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.170
Alright, Hotline,
one hour to go,


1492
01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:08.420
then we hang up our
headsets for another season!


1493
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.510
Holiday Hotline.

1494
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.050
Let's talk turkey.

1495
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.890
Hold on.

1496
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:18.640
Explain to me one more
time how this happened.


1497
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.060
Your kids put
what, where?


1498
01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.360
I roasted it with
the cars inside!


1499
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.650
Oh, a turkey isn't
a garage, Henry!


1500
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.620
Whatever you do, do not put the
frozen turkey into boiling oil.


1501
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.950
Oh, well, then definitely if
you're having the family over,


1502
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.370
a turkey matzo
ball soup, my gosh.


1503
01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:40.290
So, I don't have
any butcher's twine.


1504
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.630
Would it be okay if I used
Christmas ribbon instead?


1505
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:48.260
You can do it.

1506
01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:51.380
Well, use a shallow
roasting pan with a rack...


1507
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.550
Coat the turkey with
oil or cooking spray...


1508
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.390
White meat cooked to

1509
01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:01.600
No, I would definitely not
recommend using a chainsaw!


1510
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.610
What a plonker.

1511
01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.270
Okay, this is it.

1512
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.150
Fifty-eight,
fifty-nine...two o'clock!


1513
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:11.650
Phone lines are
officially off.


1514
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.490
Hey, we did
it, everyone!


1515
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:14.990
Yeah!!!

1516
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.120
Thank you!

1517
01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.880
Okay, everybody,
here we go.


1518
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.510
The award for greatest tragedy
averted...for talking a lady out


1519
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:35.470
of dropping an entire frozen
turkey into a deep fryer...


1520
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.390
...Thelma!

1521
01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:44.100
Thank you!

1522
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.730
Let's get a
picture right here.


1523
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.690
And now for the
Best Newcomer.


1524
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:53.700
Well, who
else, Peggy!


1525
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.290
Thank you, but Peggy
has left the building.


1526
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.710
Jack...

1527
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:14.260
Oh, um.

1528
01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:19.050
Jack, wait, please!

1529
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.640
You knew I was John and
you didn't tell me?


1530
01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.100
I wanted to, but-

1531
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.560
But you didn't.

1532
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.940
I trusted Peggy.

1533
01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.690
I trusted you.

1534
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:30.730
Why would you
do that to me?


1535
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:32.230
After everything
we talked about?


1536
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.110
It's because of what
we talked about!


1537
01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:36.410
I was afraid if I told
you, you'd give up,


1538
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:41.700
on Christmas dinner, on
opening up again and...on us.


1539
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.410
That I was
in too deep.


1540
01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.080
I...

1541
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.960
That's why I
needed more time.


1542
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.550
Time for what?

1543
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.260
Hmm?

1544
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:59.090
For what it's worth, everything
I shared as Peggy was true.


1545
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.180
Those talks meant
the world to me.


1546
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.730
And I'll always be
grateful for that.


1547
01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:11.150
I have to go.

1548
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:14.110
I have to get ready for
dinner tomorrow night.


1549
01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:16.650
I'm assuming I'm
no longer invited.


1550
01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:20.160
Huh.

1551
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:25.500
Merry Christmas, Peggy.

1552
01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.960
Or Abby.

1553
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.330
Or whoever you are.

1554
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.250
Hey.

1555
01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.340
You used
the name John.


1556
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.720
That didn't
help either!


1557
01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.300
John is my name.

1558
01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.140
Huh.

1559
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.310
When we started talking,
we weren't just strangers.


1560
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.060
I guess that much
hasn't changed, huh.


1561
01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.340
Hi, mum.

1562
01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.960
Abigail, how are you?

1563
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.130
I'm fine but
you're up early.


1564
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:20.680
We've got some
exciting news.


1565
01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.140
That chef friend of yours has
been trying to reach you.


1566
01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.510
The handsome one.

1567
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.520
Yes, Diane,
she knows that.


1568
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.350
Something about a new venue is
opening up in Covent Garden.


1569
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:32.690
He's looking
for a head chef.


1570
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.020
He's looking
for you.


1571
01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.520
Really?

1572
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:39.700
Well, I'll
think about it.


1573
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.200
I do miss home.

1574
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.700
And maybe
I'm ready now.


1575
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.450
To come back.

1576
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:51.580
Start something
fresh, where I belong.


1577
01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.540
Mum: We do miss
you, darling.


1578
01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.500
Dad: Yes, Christmas isn't
the same without you.


1579
01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.470
You might not be
without me after all.


1580
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.470
I'm coming home.

1581
01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:35.960
He wanted to
surprise you.


1582
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.590
Abby, are you okay?

1583
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:40.590
I didn't mean
to hurt him.


1584
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:45.260
I wanted to help
him and Jessica.


1585
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.100
I'm sorry...
Merry Christmas.


1586
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.060
Abby.
No, no.


1587
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.060
Just let her be.

1588
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.310
Come on.

1589
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.170
Peggy, just a little
something to thank you for


1590
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:18.460
helping me find my
Merry Christmas again.


1591
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:22.590
All my best, John.

1592
01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.110
p.s. My closest
friends call me "Jack".


1593
01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:46.030
So, please do.

1594
01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.710
What, you were just
gonna leave without


1595
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.250
saying goodbye?

1596
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.420
And you carried
your own luggage?


1597
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:05.760
That's my job!

1598
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.880
I'm so sorry.

1599
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.680
I, I thought you were
with your grandkids.


1600
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.680
I left you a note.

1601
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.350
I'll see my
family later.


1602
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:15.930
Right now I just wanted
to say how sorry I am.


1603
01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.940
If I hadn't brought
you onto the hotline,


1604
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.310
and you told you
not to say anything,


1605
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.810
none of this mess
would've happened.


1606
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.940
It's not your
fault, Margaret.


1607
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.860
Jack and I just
weren't meant to be.


1608
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.490
Are you sure
about that?


1609
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:34.950
Well, this is me.

1610
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.330
Thank you for being so
kind to me, Margaret.


1611
01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:41.630
And tell everyone in the
building I'll miss them.


1612
01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:43.920
Merry Christmas.

1613
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.880
We're all sorry
to see you go.


1614
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:52.640
Merry
Christmas, Abby.


1615
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:01.560
Thank you.

1616
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.830
Hello?

1617
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:15.080
Abby?

1618
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.000
Jason?

1619
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.710
What number are
you calling from?


1620
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:21.000
A number you
haven't blocked yet.


1621
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.090
I can't believe
it worked!


1622
01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:27.670
I...I heard about the
Covent Garden location.


1623
01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.470
Oh, it's gonna be
absolutely brilliant.


1624
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:34.100
But you know I will need
someone who I can trust.


1625
01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.100
Someone who knows
how I do things.


1626
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:39.390
Now, I realize that you'll
have some reservations,


1627
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.020
but this would be
strictly professional.


1628
01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.610
I respect you for your
talent as a chef, Abby.


1629
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.860
Now we'd be business partners,
but you'd run the entire show.


1630
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.570
What do you think?

1631
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:57.620
You know, Abby, you're a
brilliant chef, I mean,


1632
01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.000
you had me at the first taste
of your Yorkshire pudding.


1633
01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.170
Don't you want to
cook for me again?


1634
01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.880
No, Jason.

1635
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.920
Not for you.

1636
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.260
Happy Christmas.

1637
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.270
Help with your bags?

1638
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:24.480
How did you know
I wouldn't leave?


1639
01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.730
I didn't!

1640
01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.150
What am I, some kind of
magical Christmas fairy?


1641
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.450
So, what are
you gonna do now?


1642
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.620
I'm going to cook.

1643
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.450
** See the snowflakes falling *

1644
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.250
* On your windowpane *

1645
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:45.540
* Then you hear the calling *

1646
01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:48.090
* Folks to entertain *

1647
01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:51.050
* Is it him who's calling *

1648
01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:53.260
* Up into your chimney? *

1649
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.510
* Say, can you hear that choir *

1650
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:59.100
* And what they sing? *

1651
01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.350
* Winter's coming *

1652
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:04.270
and here's hoping that
it'd going to stay *


1653
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:06.980
* ‘But if it's not,
then what the heck,


1654
01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.480
it's still going to be OK' *

1655
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:12.950
This is it.
* cause I've always got you *


1656
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:16.240
* for a Christmas to
keep getting you **


1657
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.300
Mmm, mmm.

1658
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.800
This is
incredible, Abby.


1659
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.680
Peggy would
be proud!


1660
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.800
You're ready,
sweetheart.


1661
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:40.470
So, what, I just
show up at his door


1662
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.600
and hope he doesn't
slam it in my face?


1663
01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.980
Don't worry, no man in his
right mind is gonna walk away


1664
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.730
from that Yorkshire
pudding...or you.


1665
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.700
That is the cutest shirt
I've ever seen you wear.


1666
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.870
Hey, you did it, Dad!

1667
01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:01.580
Christmas
dinner at home!


1668
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.500
Isn't it great?

1669
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.920
It's amazing.

1670
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.000
Bravo.

1671
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.590
I didn't think
you had it in you.


1672
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:12.670
Well, you actually pulled it
off...with a little help from


1673
01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:14.670
your friend
at the hotline.


1674
01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.550
Where's Abby?

1675
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:16.720
When she
gonna be here?


1676
01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.390
She's not
coming, sweetie.


1677
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.930
Why not?

1678
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:21.680
You invited her.

1679
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.850
And I set her a place.

1680
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.520
Nah.

1681
01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.060
She should be here, Dad.

1682
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:32.690
She's right, you know.

1683
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:36.700
I got nothing.

1684
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:45.580
I need to see a
woman about a turkey.


1685
01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:48.830
You know, before
she flies the-


1686
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:50.250
All: Just go!!!

1687
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:51.420
Right.

1688
01:20:57.010 --> 01:21:00.050
Jack!

1689
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:02.390
I just wanted you to have
this for your dinner.


1690
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:03.760
It's Yorkshire
pudding.


1691
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:06.140
It's kind of
my specialty.


1692
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.980
When I came to Chicago, I
never wanted to make this,


1693
01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.770
or anything, ever again.

1694
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:13.980
I lost my
love of cooking.


1695
01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.650
But you changed that.

1696
01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:20.070
You inspired me to want to help
people find the joy in it.


1697
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:22.070
And because of that,

1698
01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.790
I rediscovered my
own joy of cooking.


1699
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:31.040
I found myself again and now I
know what I want in my life.


1700
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.460
It's all
because of you.


1701
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.880
Anyway, I, I was just
going to leave this here


1702
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.380
to say thank you.

1703
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:42.970
I wish I'd done
everything differently.


1704
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:46.850
I hope you can
forgive me, Jack.


1705
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:48.640
I was on my way
to find you.


1706
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:51.770
You were?

1707
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:55.980
I have to admit, that part was
a lot easier than I expected.


1708
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.490
You were really
looking for me?


1709
01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.450
I've been looking for
you for a long time.


1710
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:08.830
I know you weren't
entirely upfront with me.


1711
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:10.910
But I also know why.

1712
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.670
It wasn't intentional.

1713
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:17.460
And once I knew, I, I
didn't want to hurt you.


1714
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.760
The thing is you
didn't hurt me.


1715
01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.680
You healed me.

1716
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:26.850
I don't want
this to be over.


1717
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:32.810
I don't care if you're Peggy
or Abby or Mrs. Claus herself.


1718
01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:35.230
I'm falling in
love with you.


1719
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:58.670
Merry
Christmas, Jack.


1720
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:00.420
Happy
Christmas, Abby.


1721
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:07.390
Merry Christmas!

1722
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.140
Merry Christmas,
Jessica!


1723
01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.930
Where do we
get started?


1724
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.890
Merry Christmas!
How did you know Christmas
crackers were my favorite?


1725
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.400
Oh, my goodness.

1726
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.020
Wow, this
looks incredible!


1727
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.730
Did you see
what Jack made?


1728
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.650
Cheers.
Cheers.


1729
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:25.610
To Abby.
