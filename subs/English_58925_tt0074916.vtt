1
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:25.064
Mr Klein is based on experiences

2
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:30.606
involving several individuals.

3
00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:35.481
The facts occurred in France in 1942.

4
00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:58.647
Rounded gums...

5
00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.272
Slight prognathism.

6
00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.522
Nostrils arched...

7
00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:17.647
Naso-labial space normal.

8
00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.731
Septum slightly flattened.

9
00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.106
Lover lip fleshy.

10
00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:33.897
Prognathous jaw typical
of non-European races.


11
00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:41.439
Forehead narrow.

12
00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:46.272
Scalp low.

13
00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.106
Hair thick...

14
00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.814
oily, shiny.

15
00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.814
Ears normal... lobes not fixed...

16
00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:00.522
...slanted.

17
00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:05.106
Upper eyelids dropping.

18
00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.064
Skin swarthy.

19
00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:10.939
Facial expression
more or less Jewish.


20
00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.522
Attitudes during examination
not Jewish.


21
00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.314
Now walk.

22
00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:25.981
Hips naturally large and flaccid.

23
00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:28.439
On tiptoe now.

24
00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.814
Soles of the feet flat.

25
00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:35.647
Arch totally absent.

26
00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:38.981
Get dressed.

27
00:03:40.606 --> 00:03:43.106
In the opinion of the undersigned...

28
00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:48.022
based on morphological
and behavioural data...


29
00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:52.731
the person examined could well belong...

30
00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:55.856
to the Semitic race.

31
00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:01.106
Her ancestry could be either Jewish...

32
00:04:01.897 --> 00:04:03.439
Armenian...

33
00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:05.564
or Arab.

34
00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:10.439
For now,
the case must be considered doubtful.


35
00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:21.022
You can go.

36
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.564
How much do I owe you?

37
00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:24.022
See my secretary.

38
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.981
You'll be notified
by the Prefecture of Police.


39
00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:41.897
Fifteen francs.

40
00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:24.106
How did it go?

41
00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:26.606
All right.

42
00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:28.939
What about you?

43
00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:30.064
All right.

44
00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:37.522
Did he tell you anything?

45
00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:40.939
And you?

46
00:05:49.564 --> 00:05:51.106
Mr. Klein?

47
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.939
Come in.

48
00:06:08.772 --> 00:06:10.522
I don't know you.

49
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:15.522
I was told you might be interested...

50
00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.606
in buying paintings.

51
00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:21.647
Well... yes, I might be...

52
00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:26.481
I have a painting...

53
00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:44.522
<i>Snow, woven of quartz
and crystal...</i>


54
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.272
<i>Pendant drops...</i>

55
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.231
<i>Lacy arabesques...</i>

56
00:06:48.397 --> 00:06:51.356
<i>Webs of icy silk...</i>

57
00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:53.022
<i>Fable, dream...</i>

58
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.522
<i>spell, illusion...</i>

59
00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:57.814
<i>And suddenly...</i>

60
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.106
<i>the blue glare and the red blaze...</i>

61
00:07:00.272 --> 00:07:03.439
<i>of the young Phalangists.</i>

62
00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:05.022
<i>The flower...</i>

63
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.397
<i>the pride of France!</i>

64
00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:08.772
<i>The paladins!</i>

65
00:07:10.064 --> 00:07:12.772
<i>On the horizon,
the pinnacles of Leningrad...</i>


66
00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.481
<i>appear and disappear like a mirage.</i>

67
00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:18.939
Six hundred Louis.

68
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.189
Three hundred.

69
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:24.356
You must be joking!

70
00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:30.731
At the price, I'd rather keep it.

71
00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:32.981
As you like.

72
00:07:35.897 --> 00:07:38.939
It's easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell!


73
00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.481
But I'm not forced to buy!

74
00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:44.189
I'm not a collector...

75
00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:45.439
For me...

76
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.939
it's just a job.

77
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:52.314
Make me a reasonable offer!

78
00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:54.772
Three hundred.

79
00:08:12.147 --> 00:08:13.814
Go back to bed.

80
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:14.814
Why?

81
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:17.064
Why? Why. do you think?

82
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:20.272
Wait a minute.

83
00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.147
Later... Go back to bed.

84
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:00.356
If it was a matter of francs...

85
00:09:00.522 --> 00:09:02.564
Instead of gold Louis...

86
00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:05.897
Abroad, frames are worthless...

87
00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:08.856
But if you need the money in France...

88
00:09:10.439 --> 00:09:12.814
I don't need it in France.

89
00:09:13.606 --> 00:09:14.939
Very well...

90
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:17.897
Let's make out a receipt.

91
00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:21.814
Just a formality... it's for me.

92
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:24.147
It'll stay in my safe.

93
00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:31.064
There... write it yourself.

94
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.606
Unless you have a receipt
from whoever sold it to you.


95
00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:41.272
We've always had it in our house.

96
00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:42.897
Always!

97
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:47.564
Well, perhaps my grandfather,
when he came from Holland...


98
00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:50.981
or perhaps, his father.

99
00:09:52.272 --> 00:09:55.231
It's a long-time age...
it doesn't matter.


100
00:09:56.564 --> 00:10:00.106
It's only a formality.
Now, would you write.


101
00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:02.939
"I, the undersigned..."

102
00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.397
Name, surname and address.

103
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:11.731
No, never mind the address!

104
00:10:13.022 --> 00:10:14.647
Name, surname...

105
00:10:18.022 --> 00:10:20.189
"declare that I hereby make over...

106
00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:22.689
"to Mr. Robert Klein...

107
00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:30.022
"for an agreed sum...

108
00:10:33.564 --> 00:10:35.356
"acceptable to me...

109
00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:41.731
"agreed sum acceptable to me...

110
00:10:45.356 --> 00:10:47.522
"a painting by A. van Ostade...

111
00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:54.272
"fifty centimetres by thirty...

112
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.772
"this painting being the portrait...

113
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:05.897
"of a Dutch gentleman.

114
00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:15.606
"Paris, 16th January, 1942."

115
00:11:15.772 --> 00:11:17.481
And your signature.

116
00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:31.356
Have you got a purse...
something to put it in?


117
00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:34.272
No, but it doesn't matter.

118
00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:46.189
Won't you count it?

119
00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:55.564
Wait... I'll give you a present.

120
00:11:56.647 --> 00:11:58.772
Thank you. Don't bother.

121
00:12:05.647 --> 00:12:07.106
May I take one?

122
00:12:08.897 --> 00:12:12.897
I have friends in the same situation,
and perhaps they...


123
00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:16.939
Yes, of course.
Although I'd rather...


124
00:12:17.897 --> 00:12:22.439
Recently, I've seen many clients
like you, urgently needing to sell.


125
00:12:23.064 --> 00:12:25.939
I assure you
it's most unpleasant for me.


126
00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:27.647
Embarrassing...

127
00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:31.439
Very often...
I would rather not buy.


128
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.981
Don't buy, then!

129
00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.897
Your newspaper.

130
00:12:55.814 --> 00:12:57.189
You must've dropped it.

131
00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:03.772
<i>Jewish Information.</i>

132
00:13:06.772 --> 00:13:07.814
You are right...

133
00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:10.106
it's my name, my address.

134
00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:13.397
The postman left it by your door.

135
00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:19.522
Bon voyage... and good luck.

136
00:13:20.064 --> 00:13:22.814
Good luck to <i>you</i>, Mr. Klein!

137
00:13:39.356 --> 00:13:40.231
<i>Blue...</i>

138
00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:44.522
Indifference... a straight line
suspended in the sky.


139
00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:47.647
White... Cruelty!

140
00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:51.647
An acute angle with the point
driven into the ground.


141
00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:54.689
Black... Arrogance!

142
00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:58.647
A pyramid with its base
sunk into the sea.


143
00:13:58.814 --> 00:14:02.439
And purple... Greed!

144
00:14:02.606 --> 00:14:04.606
In the central circle, we see...

145
00:14:04.772 --> 00:14:06.147
remorse!

146
00:14:06.356 --> 00:14:07.897
A vulture...

147
00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:12.481
Its heart is pierced by an arrow,
but it continues to fly.


148
00:14:13.147 --> 00:14:15.564
In each of the four corners...

149
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:17.481
woven in different colours...

150
00:14:17.647 --> 00:14:20.272
the ancient cabbalistic symbols.

151
00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:23.272
For this splendid tapestry...

152
00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:26.439
the bidding will start
at 150.000 francs.


153
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.814
You promised to advise me...

154
00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:40.689
No, the console table.

155
00:14:40.897 --> 00:14:42.022
Did you forget?

156
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:44.981
The console table! There's time.

157
00:14:45.272 --> 00:14:47.481
I want some coffee. I'll be back.

158
00:14:47.897 --> 00:14:50.814
The tapestry.
What do you think of it?


159
00:14:51.147 --> 00:14:53.606
I think it's got the evil eye.

160
00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:56.731
NO JEWS.

161
00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:12.106
I telephoned just now.

162
00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:17.939
This morning I received your paper.
Addressed to me.


163
00:16:19.064 --> 00:16:22.147
I'm not a subscriber
and I've no intention...


164
00:16:23.147 --> 00:16:25.897
I mean, I've no reason to be.

165
00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:29.856
Isn't your paper
only sent to subscribers?


166
00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:35.272
It's our only way to keep
the community informed...


167
00:16:35.814 --> 00:16:37.356
about meetings, decisions...

168
00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:40.147
new measures
set up by the authorities, etc.


169
00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:41.564
I see...

170
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.772
but I don't belong to your...

171
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:46.106
Yes, I understand.

172
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:49.397
It is strange.

173
00:16:49.897 --> 00:16:52.189
Unless someone else...

174
00:16:53.397 --> 00:16:55.439
Perhaps a friend of yours...

175
00:16:55.772 --> 00:16:57.522
has subscribed for you.

176
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:59.772
It isn't possible!

177
00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:03.272
No one would play
that sort of joke on me.


178
00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:09.939
You think we are a subject for jokes?

179
00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:15.564
No, I didn't mean that...

180
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:18.689
but the very idea seems so absurd.

181
00:17:19.564 --> 00:17:20.772
Excuse me.

182
00:17:22.647 --> 00:17:25.314
So you no longer wish
to get our newspaper?


183
00:17:25.481 --> 00:17:26.772
Exactly.

184
00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:32.189
I would also like to know
why you sent it to me.


185
00:17:33.189 --> 00:17:36.022
I understand... unfortunately...

186
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:40.147
we must wait until the Prefecture
returns our list of subscribers.


187
00:17:40.314 --> 00:17:42.022
Then, we can check.

188
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.147
The Prefecture of Police.

189
00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:49.189
You give your lists to the police?

190
00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:54.231
They've allowed and advised us
to publish this newspaper.


191
00:17:54.897 --> 00:17:58.397
As I told you,
it's the only way we have...


192
00:17:59.314 --> 00:18:01.231
Yes, I understand.

193
00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.106
The Prefecture, but where?

194
00:18:04.564 --> 00:18:07.022
The Commission for Jewish Affairs.

195
00:18:14.647 --> 00:18:16.772
Robert Klein, did you say?

196
00:18:30.772 --> 00:18:31.981
Like that?

197
00:18:36.439 --> 00:18:37.731
Address?

198
00:18:38.522 --> 00:18:40.522
136, rue du Bac.

199
00:18:41.064 --> 00:18:43.564
How long have you lived there?

200
00:18:44.147 --> 00:18:46.981
About seven years.
Since I came to Paris.


201
00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:50.689
Yes, in fact...

202
00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:53.189
There is a Robert Klein.

203
00:18:53.606 --> 00:18:55.772
But with another address.

204
00:18:56.481 --> 00:18:58.814
Obviously a man
with the same name.


205
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:00.314
May I have his address?

206
00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:10.731
What would you say if I gave yours
to anyone who asked for it?


207
00:19:23.106 --> 00:19:25.272
Where did you say you lived?

208
00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:36.106
The fact is someone
wrote my name on the paper.


209
00:19:37.522 --> 00:19:39.606
You understand my anxiety?

210
00:19:40.897 --> 00:19:42.147
Perfectly.

211
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:46.606
It's curiosity more than anxiety,
the fact that someone...


212
00:19:51.856 --> 00:19:54.522
I'm sorry...
I'm taking up your time.


213
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:57.689
This cannot interest the police!

214
00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:03.981
Luckily for me!

215
00:21:18.981 --> 00:21:22.064
Moby Dick. What does it mean?
Is it a name?


216
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:26.022
A woman?

217
00:21:27.064 --> 00:21:29.481
No... a whale.

218
00:21:39.814 --> 00:21:42.231
He's exactly like me!

219
00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:43.564
Who's that?

220
00:21:44.106 --> 00:21:45.772
Ishmael!

221
00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:47.897
Listen to this!

222
00:21:48.897 --> 00:21:50.856
"Sixteen hours in bed!

223
00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:54.231
"The small of my back ached.

224
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.647
"I felt worse and worse.

225
00:21:56.814 --> 00:21:59.106
"At last I got up...

226
00:21:59.731 --> 00:22:03.564
"and threw myself at her feet,
beseeching her to beat me...


227
00:22:04.064 --> 00:22:05.939
"to do anything indeed...

228
00:22:06.106 --> 00:22:09.147
"but condemn me to lie abed...

229
00:22:09.314 --> 00:22:13.022
"such an unendurable length of time."

230
00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:28.356
Can I get UP?

231
00:22:32.314 --> 00:22:34.522
Do me a favour,
take another book.


232
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.856
The one with the rose binding.

233
00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:05.231
Page forty-seven...

234
00:23:05.397 --> 00:23:07.272
"Pale and trembling like doves...

235
00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:09.272
"the three maidens entered the room.

236
00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:11.356
"In the dancing firelight...

237
00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:14.522
"it looked even more imposing
and fantastic..."


238
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:17.106
It's not possible!

239
00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:18.856
Go on.

240
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:20.689
I can't!

241
00:23:21.314 --> 00:23:22.564
Go on!

242
00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:28.272
"...imposing and fantastic...

243
00:23:29.356 --> 00:23:31.897
"That enormous penis...

244
00:23:32.856 --> 00:23:34.272
"Tumescent...

245
00:23:34.856 --> 00:23:36.231
"Superb...

246
00:23:36.564 --> 00:23:37.772
"Alive!"

247
00:24:16.731 --> 00:24:18.731
I know very little about him.

248
00:24:18.897 --> 00:24:21.106
I never saw much of him.

249
00:24:21.397 --> 00:24:23.564
The girl took care of everything.

250
00:24:23.731 --> 00:24:25.272
A brunette...

251
00:24:25.606 --> 00:24:27.022
Pretty sexy...

252
00:24:27.189 --> 00:24:29.314
I think she was a whore...

253
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.606
or a dancer.

254
00:24:32.564 --> 00:24:36.231
He only went out at night,
when I was in bed.


255
00:24:37.064 --> 00:24:41.147
Around midnight, after the curfew,
I'd hear him come down the stairs.


256
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:44.147
And the morning I saw him...

257
00:24:44.314 --> 00:24:47.731
it was about five.
I was putting out the rubbish.


258
00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:49.814
Oh, look!

259
00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:56.772
You're Mr. Klein, aren't you?
First floor?


260
00:24:58.064 --> 00:24:59.772
No... no, I'm sorry.

261
00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:02.106
I'm not <i>your</i> Mr. Klein.

262
00:25:02.647 --> 00:25:04.189
Excuse me.

263
00:25:05.272 --> 00:25:07.189
I thought you were...

264
00:25:08.272 --> 00:25:09.939
Same height, same hair...

265
00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:12.439
Slim. The same look...

266
00:25:13.106 --> 00:25:15.897
But I never saw his face.

267
00:25:17.439 --> 00:25:19.231
What do you want?

268
00:25:19.397 --> 00:25:22.981
It's about the apartment,
is it still free?


269
00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:25.897
If you don't mind waiting a minute.

270
00:25:26.064 --> 00:25:27.231
Not at all.

271
00:25:28.272 --> 00:25:30.647
We've finished.
What about the visiting card?


272
00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:31.981
Yes... here you are.

273
00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:36.481
Wait, I'll write down
the address for his mail.


274
00:25:36.647 --> 00:25:38.106
Does he still get mail?

275
00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:39.814
Yes, not much.

276
00:25:40.189 --> 00:25:41.689
One newspaper. One letter.

277
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:43.689
Nothing else.

278
00:25:46.981 --> 00:25:49.064
So you want to move in here?

279
00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:52.064
No, it's for a friend
who's coming to Paris.


280
00:25:56.397 --> 00:25:58.397
If you hear anything, call us.

281
00:25:58.564 --> 00:25:59.897
Yes, certainly...

282
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:12.856
The apartment,
you really want to see it?


283
00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:28.147
Wallpaper's got to be changed,
it's rotten.


284
00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:31.189
Ceiling needs painting.

285
00:26:33.272 --> 00:26:36.106
Toilet bowl's got to be changed.

286
00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:40.147
You'd have to get rid of the rats.

287
00:26:41.356 --> 00:26:42.731
Yes, rats!

288
00:26:42.897 --> 00:26:44.439
Look at that!

289
00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:46.897
All over the place!

290
00:26:57.939 --> 00:27:00.106
It's not a place for you.

291
00:27:00.272 --> 00:27:02.731
Anyway, if you're interested...

292
00:27:02.897 --> 00:27:04.939
it's 50 francs a month.

293
00:27:05.231 --> 00:27:06.481
Enormous!

294
00:27:06.647 --> 00:27:09.689
Plus electricity
and cleaning the stairs.


295
00:27:32.231 --> 00:27:33.772
He had a dog?

296
00:27:34.022 --> 00:27:36.856
Yes, an Alsatian.

297
00:27:38.064 --> 00:27:40.814
Sometimes he'd bark,
and then whimper...


298
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:43.856
as if he was being beaten.

299
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:14.731
My husband said a house is judged
by its lavatory and he was right!


300
00:28:16.772 --> 00:28:19.647
Well, haven't you seen enough?

301
00:28:21.397 --> 00:28:22.272
The shower.

302
00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:24.689
The shower?
It's out of order.


303
00:28:43.647 --> 00:28:44.647
What's wrong?

304
00:28:47.814 --> 00:28:49.397
I'm sorry...

305
00:28:49.564 --> 00:28:52.231
Since my husband went...

306
00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:53.564
I get funny.

307
00:28:54.606 --> 00:28:57.397
Every now and then...

308
00:28:57.731 --> 00:29:00.564
I have these hallucinations.

309
00:29:03.189 --> 00:29:04.731
Is your husband dead?

310
00:29:06.897 --> 00:29:08.314
No, he's in Germany.

311
00:29:08.481 --> 00:29:09.939
Prisoner of war.

312
00:29:23.189 --> 00:29:24.856
Yes, I remember.

313
00:29:25.314 --> 00:29:27.814
A pretty girl...
and a beautiful dog.


314
00:29:35.814 --> 00:29:39.856
You, on the other hand...
your face was hidden!


315
00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:43.022
But you're recognizable.

316
00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:46.231
That sidecar...
you still have it?


317
00:29:46.606 --> 00:29:48.856
No, it blew up!

318
00:29:58.106 --> 00:29:59.397
May I?

319
00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:17.439
Who's this skeleton in your house?

320
00:31:17.606 --> 00:31:18.856
What skeleton?

321
00:31:19.022 --> 00:31:19.856
That whore!

322
00:31:20.814 --> 00:31:21.939
What do you mean?

323
00:31:24.356 --> 00:31:25.647
A girl called Janine.

324
00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:31.147
She's a friend.

325
00:31:45.147 --> 00:31:47.647
Why did I find her here?

326
00:31:47.897 --> 00:31:50.189
Because you got here after!

327
00:31:51.689 --> 00:31:53.689
But she was alone in the house!

328
00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:56.481
Because she got here before!

329
00:31:58.022 --> 00:31:59.439
Is your husband here?

330
00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:09.647
And two policemen are waiting for you.

331
00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:39.397
Sorry, I'm late...

332
00:32:45.772 --> 00:32:47.439
They're waiting for you.

333
00:32:47.606 --> 00:32:48.814
Yes, your wife told me.

334
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:49.981
What's going on?

335
00:32:50.147 --> 00:32:52.314
Nothing... I'll explain later.

336
00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:04.522
I think we've met before.

337
00:33:04.814 --> 00:33:06.981
We have the same impression.

338
00:33:07.147 --> 00:33:09.772
Did you take that apartment
for your friend?


339
00:33:09.939 --> 00:33:12.731
I haven't decided yet.

340
00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:16.397
We've brought back your card.

341
00:33:16.564 --> 00:33:18.022
Thank you very much.

342
00:33:18.439 --> 00:33:21.481
I have a terrible habit
of handing them around.


343
00:33:22.939 --> 00:33:23.939
How about a drink?

344
00:33:24.106 --> 00:33:26.981
No, thank you.
But we can wait.


345
00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:30.147
Are we going somewhere?

346
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.647
Pigalle Police station.

347
00:33:31.814 --> 00:33:33.731
Again?
I went there after I saw you!


348
00:33:34.522 --> 00:33:37.022
I spoke to the inspector

349
00:33:38.856 --> 00:33:41.189
Pierre!
Please turn down the gramophone.


350
00:33:42.356 --> 00:33:45.147
Nicole, will you get me a beer?

351
00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:53.522
Maybe you should ring him,
that would save time.


352
00:33:59.397 --> 00:34:00.814
Pigalle 30-30.

353
00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:05.439
Call him, François.

354
00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:07.439
- May I?
- Go right ahead.


355
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:21.564
Bastard!

356
00:34:22.397 --> 00:34:24.856
Inspector...
we're with Mr. Klein...


357
00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:31.606
Yes, sir... very well.

358
00:34:36.689 --> 00:34:38.772
Who could this other Klein be?

359
00:34:38.939 --> 00:34:40.356
I've no idea.

360
00:34:41.231 --> 00:34:44.106
I first heard about him
at the Prefecture.


361
00:34:44.272 --> 00:34:46.772
Our orders came from the Prefecture!

362
00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:51.897
Anyway, if you hear anything...

363
00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:54.897
Don't worry, it's in my interest.

364
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.314
I don't like this business.

365
00:35:25.772 --> 00:35:29.064
So it's a man who's got
the same name... a Jew!


366
00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:31.772
He's gone off
and left you with his problem!


367
00:35:31.939 --> 00:35:33.772
How could he know about me?

368
00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:36.397
Your visiting cards
are all over Paris!


369
00:35:36.564 --> 00:35:37.814
It doesn't make sense!

370
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:41.022
Does he hope that I'll shut up
and take his place?


371
00:35:42.022 --> 00:35:44.231
It's a man with a grudge
against me...


372
00:35:44.397 --> 00:35:47.106
trying to get me into trouble,
to provoke me...


373
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:49.439
Why should he have a grudge?

374
00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.856
And why not?

375
00:38:40.231 --> 00:38:41.397
"My love...

376
00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:44.064
"what interminable months!

377
00:38:44.647 --> 00:38:48.897
"In two days it'll be our January 26th.
I'm here, waiting for you.


378
00:38:49.272 --> 00:38:53.064
"The train for Ivry-la-Bataille
still leaves at six-fifteen.


379
00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:57.689
"You mustn't miss it, you know that?'
Because this time, I swear...


380
00:38:58.231 --> 00:39:01.231
"you'd lose me,
and that would be awful...


381
00:39:01.397 --> 00:39:02.772
"My darling!

382
00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:04.897
"Florence."

383
00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.522
You mustn't miss it...

384
00:39:12.689 --> 00:39:15.189
this time, it would be awful,
my darling.


385
00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:43.522
Have you any luggage?

386
00:40:44.606 --> 00:40:46.231
This way, sir.

387
00:41:58.481 --> 00:42:00.022
Good evening, Mr Klein.

388
00:42:00.189 --> 00:42:01.856
Please, come in.

389
00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:06.439
They're expecting you.

390
00:42:06.647 --> 00:42:08.981
May I take your coat?

391
00:43:23.647 --> 00:43:25.481
Charles
-Xavier.

392
00:43:26.439 --> 00:43:28.189
Your host.

393
00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:40.772
I know, it's a complicated story.

394
00:43:42.564 --> 00:43:46.314
Come, it's quieter in there.

395
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:48.772
Yes, then I can explain...

396
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:32.189
Can you imagine Robert
living in Pigalle?


397
00:44:32.356 --> 00:44:34.064
In a furnished room!

398
00:44:36.939 --> 00:44:38.981
In lodgings, rue des Abbesses!

399
00:44:39.147 --> 00:44:42.022
It's impossible! It's absurd!

400
00:44:42.189 --> 00:44:43.939
This gentleman has the same name.

401
00:44:44.106 --> 00:44:45.772
Really? Like Robert?

402
00:44:46.272 --> 00:44:47.522
Isn't it funny!

403
00:44:47.689 --> 00:44:49.356
Please, sit down.

404
00:44:50.856 --> 00:44:52.981
What was Robert doing in Pigalle?

405
00:44:53.147 --> 00:44:54.314
Nothing.

406
00:44:54.731 --> 00:44:56.481
I don't think he was ever there.

407
00:44:56.647 --> 00:45:00.689
Then God knows why this letter
was sent to him in Pigalle!


408
00:45:00.856 --> 00:45:02.064
That's right...

409
00:45:02.856 --> 00:45:04.314
there's a letter.

410
00:45:04.606 --> 00:45:06.106
They're waiting for us.

411
00:45:06.272 --> 00:45:08.231
Couldn't we read it after dinner?

412
00:45:08.397 --> 00:45:10.022
It's only a few lines.

413
00:45:11.147 --> 00:45:12.814
We're all starving!

414
00:45:13.647 --> 00:45:15.647
Yes... I see your point.

415
00:45:16.439 --> 00:45:19.439
But if you knew Robert
as well as I do.

416
00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:22.397
I cannot accept your theory!

417
00:45:22.564 --> 00:45:25.272
We can't be talking
about the same person!


418
00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:27.772
Let's go in to dinner.
Will you stay?


419
00:45:27.939 --> 00:45:30.147
Thank you, I must go back to Paris.

420
00:45:30.314 --> 00:45:31.856
There's a train quite soon.

421
00:45:32.022 --> 00:45:34.356
There are no more trains tonight.

422
00:45:34.522 --> 00:45:36.189
No, only on odd days.

423
00:45:36.356 --> 00:45:39.022
You see? Now, you have no excuse!

424
00:45:39.314 --> 00:45:41.189
There must be a hotel near there...

425
00:45:41.522 --> 00:45:42.689
Requisitioned.

426
00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:44.772
Don't worry, you're my guest.

427
00:45:46.147 --> 00:45:46.939
Anyhow...

428
00:45:48.314 --> 00:45:51.189
we did invite you
in a way, didn't we?

429
00:45:51.356 --> 00:45:54.231
Come on...
now you have no more excuses.


430
00:46:25.272 --> 00:46:27.397
No, don't move!

431
00:46:27.564 --> 00:46:29.356
Don't turn on the light!

432
00:46:36.231 --> 00:46:38.272
Don't turn on the light!

433
00:46:40.064 --> 00:46:41.314
My letter...

434
00:46:41.522 --> 00:46:44.564
Do you mind giving it back to me?

435
00:46:46.689 --> 00:46:48.689
Do you mind turning round?

436
00:46:51.897 --> 00:46:53.439
I sleep naked.

437
00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:19.939
Tell me...

438
00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.814
does your friend happen to be Jewish?

439
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:27.147
Robert? I don't think so.

440
00:47:27.856 --> 00:47:31.064
As far as I know, he's an atheist.

441
00:47:31.897 --> 00:47:34.272
Yet he subscribes to a Jewish paper!

442
00:47:34.439 --> 00:47:37.731
That's possible. 
He reads a lot.

443
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:39.314
And talks very little!

444
00:47:39.481 --> 00:47:41.731
Who told you that? 
On the contrary.

445
00:47:42.564 --> 00:47:45.106
Then what did he tell you about me?

446
00:47:45.564 --> 00:47:46.731
Nothing.

447
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.522
He never mentioned you.

448
00:47:50.189 --> 00:47:51.397
No letter then!

449
00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:02.231
I know what Robert would say
if he was here!


450
00:48:02.814 --> 00:48:05.939
First, he'd compare you
to an animal or an insect!


451
00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:10.439
His theory is based on what he calls...

452
00:48:10.606 --> 00:48:14.147
the infinite variety
of specialized instincts.


453
00:48:14.314 --> 00:48:16.481
- How fascinating!
- Isn't it?


454
00:48:16.647 --> 00:48:19.856
He claims that in animals
and insects...


455
00:48:20.022 --> 00:48:22.064
this variety appears...

456
00:48:22.231 --> 00:48:24.356
in many different species.

457
00:48:24.522 --> 00:48:26.689
But in man this is not possible...

458
00:48:26.856 --> 00:48:29.606
as there's only one human species.
Therefore...


459
00:48:29.772 --> 00:48:31.272
I get the point.

460
00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:42.564
The eyes are important!

461
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:44.064
The mouth.

462
00:48:44.397 --> 00:48:46.314
The curve of the lips.

463
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:49.481
Feeling of superiority over others.

464
00:48:49.647 --> 00:48:51.397
Sense of freedom.

465
00:48:51.606 --> 00:48:53.314
Egoism.

466
00:48:53.689 --> 00:48:54.731
A bird...

467
00:48:55.522 --> 00:48:56.189
<i>Qi prey'-!</i>

468
00:48:56.731 --> 00:48:57.606
Falcon!

469
00:48:58.231 --> 00:48:59.064
Vulture.

470
00:48:59.231 --> 00:48:59.897
Why?

471
00:49:00.564 --> 00:49:02.147
Do I eat corpses?

472
00:49:04.897 --> 00:49:07.522
You don't return letters.

473
00:49:11.147 --> 00:49:12.939
How about your friend?

474
00:49:15.147 --> 00:49:17.731
What animal has he chosen for himself?

475
00:49:18.064 --> 00:49:20.356
The eagle?.. The lion?

476
00:49:20.939 --> 00:49:22.397
The snake.

477
00:49:22.731 --> 00:49:26.439
A hibernating snake...
waiting for a better season.


478
00:49:28.314 --> 00:49:31.856
I can't understand
why he got you into this mess.


479
00:49:33.647 --> 00:49:35.606
So he could hide, I think.

480
00:49:36.897 --> 00:49:39.272
Disappear behind another man.

481
00:49:40.356 --> 00:49:41.147
Me!

482
00:49:41.314 --> 00:49:43.189
No, he's not a coward.

483
00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:45.522
He wouldn't harm anyone.

484
00:49:45.689 --> 00:49:47.314
Except himself, perhaps.

485
00:49:47.481 --> 00:49:50.981
Or else for revenge.
Yes, then he might.


486
00:49:51.147 --> 00:49:53.147
Revenge?.. But what for?

487
00:49:53.314 --> 00:49:55.189
I don't even know him!

488
00:49:55.856 --> 00:49:58.814
You know what I thought
when I saw you?


489
00:50:02.106 --> 00:50:05.147
That Robert himself had sent you.

490
00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:06.481
Why?

491
00:50:06.647 --> 00:50:09.689
To explain to me
why he hadn't come.


492
00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:13.147
To see how I'd react...
to provoke me...


493
00:50:13.314 --> 00:50:15.147
to humiliate me.

494
00:50:15.522 --> 00:50:16.731
I don't understand.

495
00:50:16.897 --> 00:50:18.522
Yes, as if to tell me...

496
00:50:18.689 --> 00:50:22.647
"I'm sending another man,
but for you it'll be the same!"


497
00:50:24.814 --> 00:50:27.272
He could do that!

498
00:50:28.522 --> 00:50:31.147
It seems a little extreme,
don't you think?


499
00:50:31.439 --> 00:50:33.772
He could very well do that!

500
00:50:39.272 --> 00:50:41.522
What if it was so?

501
00:50:42.356 --> 00:50:44.522
Suppose that's why I came!

502
00:50:45.022 --> 00:50:47.606
He loves that sort of situation!

503
00:50:48.939 --> 00:50:50.231
So do I.

504
00:50:50.939 --> 00:50:52.189
What about you?

505
00:50:52.689 --> 00:50:54.731
Even if it's a false situation?

506
00:50:54.897 --> 00:50:56.356
Especially!

507
00:50:58.231 --> 00:51:00.897
Or... let us suppose...

508
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:06.731
It's very late. I must go.

509
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:10.439
My husband must be looking for me.

510
00:53:04.231 --> 00:53:06.856
We forgot to say good night.

511
00:53:08.689 --> 00:53:12.147
Whenever that happens,
I can't sleep.


512
00:53:18.606 --> 00:53:21.314
I see you have the same problem!

513
00:53:31.314 --> 00:53:34.314
Do you realize
I could go to the police?


514
00:53:39.064 --> 00:53:40.897
Then you must talk!

515
00:53:41.897 --> 00:53:43.481
Where is he?

516
00:53:44.314 --> 00:53:46.106
I swear I don't know.

517
00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:50.606
I'll start at the beginning.

518
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:53.981
Where did he live before Pigalle?

519
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:57.731
In a hotel... rue de l'Université.

520
00:53:58.772 --> 00:54:01.606
When did you learn about Pigalle?

521
00:54:01.772 --> 00:54:03.439
Two months ago.

522
00:54:04.356 --> 00:54:06.439
Through a messenger boy...

523
00:54:06.606 --> 00:54:09.814
who brought me his flute and a note.

524
00:54:11.397 --> 00:54:13.147
What did the note say?

525
00:54:14.272 --> 00:54:15.481
Nothing.

526
00:54:16.897 --> 00:54:19.147
Jokes, as always.

527
00:54:19.564 --> 00:54:21.606
He was going into hibernation...

528
00:54:21.772 --> 00:54:26.064
and I was to keep his flute
until a better season.


529
00:54:26.856 --> 00:54:28.731
Into hibernation, where?

530
00:54:30.981 --> 00:54:34.189
I don't know. He didn't say.

531
00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:36.439
Very well.

532
00:54:37.939 --> 00:54:39.939
The police will find out.

533
00:54:40.606 --> 00:54:44.481
You, your husband
and all your musical zoo...


534
00:54:45.106 --> 00:54:47.106
will be called in for questioning.

535
00:54:48.772 --> 00:54:51.606
No! Please don't do that!

536
00:54:53.231 --> 00:54:54.856
I'm sorry, Florence.

537
00:54:55.272 --> 00:54:57.897
One way or another I must find out...

538
00:54:58.064 --> 00:55:00.522
what this man wants from me.

539
00:55:10.064 --> 00:55:11.981
A pity about last night!

540
00:55:14.314 --> 00:55:15.439
Just a moment!

541
00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:18.564
All right!

542
00:55:19.606 --> 00:55:23.856
But first, swear
you won't go to the police.


543
00:55:35.606 --> 00:55:36.772
I swear.

544
00:55:46.439 --> 00:55:50.147
136 rue du Bac.

545
00:57:41.564 --> 00:57:43.106
You have the present?

546
00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:45.439
I didn't sleep all night!

547
00:57:45.606 --> 00:57:47.064
Neither did I...
You have it?


548
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:50.064
You could've told me.
People came for you.


549
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:51.231
What for?

550
00:57:51.439 --> 00:57:52.772
I don't know.

551
00:58:24.189 --> 00:58:25.439
Is it serious?

552
00:58:35.106 --> 00:58:39.022
Tell me... the Kleins...
are they French-French?


553
00:58:39.231 --> 00:58:42.106
Or are there Jews in your family?

554
00:58:48.064 --> 00:58:49.689
Indifference...

555
00:58:49.856 --> 00:58:52.814
is like a still, flat sea...

556
00:58:52.981 --> 00:58:55.272
around a drowning man.

557
00:58:55.814 --> 00:58:58.897
Like a flock of sheep...

558
00:58:59.064 --> 00:59:02.814
grazing in the ruins of a village.

559
00:59:03.397 --> 00:59:05.189
Or like a worm...

560
00:59:05.522 --> 00:59:09.689
crawling over a putrid wound.

561
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:16.564
A man can be mean, selfish,
hypocritical, anything!


562
00:59:16.731 --> 00:59:20.981
As long as he's aware!

563
00:59:23.272 --> 00:59:24.939
The result is the same.

564
00:59:26.022 --> 00:59:27.856
No, not exactly.

565
00:59:28.022 --> 00:59:30.981
Have you ever heard of remorse?

566
00:59:32.272 --> 00:59:36.939
It's like a vulture
pierced by an arrow...


567
00:59:37.731 --> 00:59:39.481
but it continues to fly.

568
00:59:39.647 --> 00:59:41.564
Oh, it's you!

569
00:59:42.647 --> 00:59:44.481
What's the matter?

570
00:59:45.314 --> 00:59:47.439
Why are you here?

571
00:59:47.606 --> 00:59:48.647
To see you.

572
00:59:48.814 --> 00:59:51.189
Yes, of course, but what else?

573
00:59:51.606 --> 00:59:52.897
Nostalgia...

574
00:59:53.939 --> 00:59:55.731
for my roots.

575
00:59:57.189 --> 01:00:00.231
I want the birth certificates
of my grandparents.


576
01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.189
On both sides.

577
01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:04.981
And mine too, naturally.

578
01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:06.731
And why?

579
01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:08.814
I told you.

580
01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.856
Nostalgia... curiosity.

581
01:00:21.647 --> 01:00:24.981
Don't be idiotic, Robert.
Tell me why!


582
01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:27.814
It's nothing.

583
01:00:28.897 --> 01:00:32.147
A formality... a routine check.

584
01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:38.439
The police, these days, in Paris...
they want to prove they exist!


585
01:00:38.606 --> 01:00:39.814
And so...

586
01:00:40.231 --> 01:00:44.022
a slight misunderstanding
has to be cleared up.


587
01:00:44.522 --> 01:00:46.939
What sort of misunderstanding?

588
01:00:47.897 --> 01:00:49.397
About my identity.

589
01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:51.814
What's it got to do
with your grandparents?


590
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.231
Your own certificate should be enough.

591
01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:56.814
Or mine at the most, and your mother's.

592
01:00:57.022 --> 01:01:00.272
They want the grandparent's too,
to be sure.


593
01:01:00.897 --> 01:01:02.606
Sure of what?

594
01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:04.939
Of my origins.

595
01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.147
Well, yes...

596
01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:12.647
I must prove I'm not a man
the police are looking for.


597
01:01:34.939 --> 01:01:37.522
How long have they given you?

598
01:01:40.231 --> 01:01:41.397
Fifteen days.

599
01:01:42.356 --> 01:01:44.189
That's quite enough.

600
01:01:45.314 --> 01:01:49.564
It all sounds very strange.

601
01:01:50.772 --> 01:01:52.981
Really nothing more?

602
01:01:54.314 --> 01:01:55.647
It's just a formality.

603
01:01:55.814 --> 01:01:57.689
There's no real doubt.

604
01:01:58.022 --> 01:02:01.272
So why do they want the certificates?

605
01:02:03.189 --> 01:02:04.939
Because it's the law!

606
01:02:13.606 --> 01:02:16.272
Also, there's another Robert Klein.

607
01:02:16.897 --> 01:02:19.231
Apparently, he is a Jew.

608
01:02:25.106 --> 01:02:26.522
It's impossible!

609
01:02:27.189 --> 01:02:30.481
Or it could be the Dutch branch.

610
01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.689
Are there Kleins in Holland?

611
01:02:32.856 --> 01:02:35.231
Oh, quite a different breed!

612
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:37.272
But we're related!

613
01:02:37.897 --> 01:02:42.106
We've been French and Catholic
since Louis XIV!


614
01:03:01.522 --> 01:03:02.439
No, I'm all right.

615
01:03:02.606 --> 01:03:05.897
Three of the certificates
are here in Strasbourg.


616
01:03:06.064 --> 01:03:08.689
But my maternal grandparents...

617
01:03:08.856 --> 01:03:11.106
One was born in Marseilles.

618
01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:19.022
Yes, B-l-e-a-r-d, you got it?

619
01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:21.356
And my grandmother in Algiers.

620
01:03:24.647 --> 01:03:25.939
No, she wasn't Arab!

621
01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:27.481
Imbecile!

622
01:03:27.689 --> 01:03:30.356
Daughter of a deported Communard!

623
01:03:31.481 --> 01:03:33.564
Send someone to Algiers

624
01:03:33.731 --> 01:03:35.022
and Marseilles now.

625
01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:41.022
See you tomorrow.

626
01:03:44.522 --> 01:03:45.981
My lawyer.

627
01:03:50.689 --> 01:03:54.689
Those Kleins from Holland...
do you know them?


628
01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:58.314
I've heard about them.

629
01:03:59.481 --> 01:04:01.897
And this other Robert Klein?

630
01:04:06.022 --> 01:04:07.356
Never!

631
01:08:09.772 --> 01:08:13.272
Now, I'm going to do...

632
01:08:13.772 --> 01:08:17.022
what <i>they</i> ought to do!

633
01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.689
Leave!

634
01:08:24.564 --> 01:08:27.439
Before you throw me out...

635
01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:33.231
with a kick in the arse!

636
01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:37.981
Let's go please!

637
01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.439
Maybe, it's not for me.

638
01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:32.689
He could be hiding in the crowd.

639
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.897
You think I'm mad?

640
01:10:41.522 --> 01:10:43.064
What were you saying?

641
01:10:44.564 --> 01:10:46.731
I sent my assistant to Ivry.

642
01:10:46.897 --> 01:10:49.647
The house is closed...
they gone to Mexico.


643
01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:52.939
Are they Jews too?

644
01:10:54.064 --> 01:10:55.272
Probably.

645
01:10:56.981 --> 01:11:01.106
Look, you can play
at being a detective, chasing ghosts.


646
01:11:01.272 --> 01:11:02.814
But at least do what I say!

647
01:11:04.606 --> 01:11:06.356
We can't go on waiting like fools...

648
01:11:06.522 --> 01:11:09.064
for papers which may never come!

649
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.147
Let's try to get a...

650
01:11:10.397 --> 01:11:13.481
No. I told you I'm not a horse!

651
01:11:13.731 --> 01:11:16.147
I won't have my nostrils
measured or my ears, etc.


652
01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.647
I detest veterinaries.

653
01:11:18.814 --> 01:11:21.356
I'll wait for the papers from Algiers.

654
01:11:21.606 --> 01:11:24.897
A cautious man like you,
showing such confidence...


655
01:11:25.064 --> 01:11:28.439
in the post office, the railways,
bureaucracy... and the police!


656
01:11:28.689 --> 01:11:30.397
I'm a good Frenchman.

657
01:11:30.564 --> 01:11:32.647
I believe in our institutions!

658
01:11:32.814 --> 01:11:33.939
Including the phone!

659
01:11:40.772 --> 01:11:42.231
Was there a call for me?

660
01:11:42.397 --> 01:11:43.981
No... no one rang.

661
01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:55.147
I am Mr Klein.

662
01:11:55.314 --> 01:11:57.272
Someone was asking for you...

663
01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.481
at the bar.

664
01:12:05.814 --> 01:12:07.647
Well... he was here!

665
01:12:08.814 --> 01:12:10.939
He must've gone... that's strange!

666
01:12:11.106 --> 01:12:12.356
What was he like?

667
01:12:12.522 --> 01:12:16.147
Tall... with dark hair...
pretty much like you.


668
01:12:18.272 --> 01:12:20.939
Do you really think this man...?

669
01:12:26.522 --> 01:12:28.856
You can't!..
The curfew's in 30 minutes!


670
01:12:29.022 --> 01:12:30.772
- I'll sleep here.
- Where?


671
01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:32.106
I'll rent the place.

672
01:12:32.272 --> 01:12:33.064
Why not?

673
01:12:33.231 --> 01:12:34.772
Well, first I have to see...

674
01:12:34.939 --> 01:12:36.231
the administrator.

675
01:12:36.397 --> 01:12:38.689
I'll see him tomorrow.

676
01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:46.564
Here's the deposit.

677
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:48.814
No, I'm not allowed to...

678
01:12:48.981 --> 01:12:50.564
What if it's for you?

679
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:52.856
- For your trouble.
- I don't want it.


680
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:56.356
You don't really mean
to sleep here, do you?


681
01:12:56.522 --> 01:12:57.189
Why not?

682
01:12:57.564 --> 01:13:00.481
The police told me
not to let anyone in.


683
01:13:00.647 --> 01:13:01.606
And if they check...

684
01:13:01.772 --> 01:13:03.481
I just want to have a look.

685
01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:04.606
But you've seen it!

686
01:13:04.772 --> 01:13:07.064
I must see it again to decide.

687
01:13:07.314 --> 01:13:09.897
This man Klein...
did you hear from him?


688
01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:14.314
What about the girl?

689
01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:15.772
What's her name again?

690
01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:17.522
Isabelle!

691
01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:21.356
And her last name?

692
01:13:22.897 --> 01:13:24.481
I never knew.

693
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.772
<i>Is that you, Robert?</i>

694
01:15:31.272 --> 01:15:34.689
<i>I'm across the street...
I saw you at the window.</i>


695
01:15:39.981 --> 01:15:41.772
<i>Did something happen?</i>

696
01:15:46.647 --> 01:15:48.356
<i>Then why?</i>

697
01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:52.814
Why what?

698
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:19.397
Someone keeps ringing.

699
01:16:19.981 --> 01:16:21.522
Who was it?

700
01:16:26.106 --> 01:16:29.481
I don't know...
it was a woman's voice.


701
01:16:29.814 --> 01:16:32.564
Did you give her
Mr Klein's new number?


702
01:16:33.147 --> 01:16:35.064
How stupid of me!

703
01:16:35.522 --> 01:16:37.689
How could you know it!

704
01:17:05.106 --> 01:17:07.356
We have no Isabelle here.

705
01:17:20.897 --> 01:17:21.939
What is it, Gérard?

706
01:17:22.106 --> 01:17:24.022
This man's looking for a girl.

707
01:17:25.897 --> 01:17:27.106
Here I am!

708
01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:29.522
Well, <i>her</i> name is Isabelle.

709
01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.106
Too bad!

710
01:17:37.647 --> 01:17:41.022
I don't know her.
No one here's called Isabelle.


711
01:17:42.522 --> 01:17:43.647
Look...

712
01:17:45.106 --> 01:17:47.106
That's not Isabelle, it's Cathy!

713
01:17:47.564 --> 01:17:49.231
She isn't here any more.

714
01:17:49.397 --> 01:17:53.564
She left two months ago...
maybe three.


715
01:17:53.939 --> 01:17:55.439
Know where she lives?

716
01:17:55.606 --> 01:17:58.522
With him, I think...
God knows where!


717
01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:00.314
Do you know him?

718
01:18:00.856 --> 01:18:04.481
I saw him a couple of times,
when he came for her.


719
01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:09.272
He's no good.

720
01:18:09.897 --> 01:18:12.231
A Corsican... or an Arab.

721
01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.647
Something like that.

722
01:18:14.897 --> 01:18:17.897
He's a gangster, you see...
or a pimp!


723
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:21.106
And he plays the flute!

724
01:18:21.689 --> 01:18:23.064
No... nothing.

725
01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:25.022
Anyway, he's wrecked her.

726
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:27.522
She was such a nice, funny girl!

727
01:18:27.689 --> 01:18:30.022
I saw her recently. 
She's changed!

728
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:32.189
Tough, distant.

729
01:18:32.356 --> 01:18:33.981
And those horrible overalls!

730
01:18:34.147 --> 01:18:35.522
Overalls?

731
01:18:36.564 --> 01:18:38.189
Come on, hurry up!

732
01:18:38.356 --> 01:18:40.106
You're on in ten minutes!

733
01:18:42.689 --> 01:18:43.981
Will you wait for me?

734
01:18:44.147 --> 01:18:47.439
Yes, but first tell me
where you saw her!


735
01:18:47.897 --> 01:18:49.231
After the show.

736
01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:52.064
Where did you see her?

737
01:18:52.231 --> 01:18:53.939
In the metro, at Balard Station.

738
01:18:54.106 --> 01:18:55.856
She was going to work.

739
01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.731
That's what she said!

740
01:20:45.397 --> 01:20:46.981
Excuse me...

741
01:20:47.147 --> 01:20:49.231
do you know this girl?

742
01:20:50.897 --> 01:20:52.231
Let me see.

743
01:20:54.397 --> 01:20:55.522
I don't know her.

744
01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:56.814
You know her?

745
01:20:57.314 --> 01:21:00.106
She's not the type
to work in a factory!


746
01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.147
What's she got on her face?

747
01:21:03.772 --> 01:21:06.772
Sure...
glycerine mixed with nitrate...


748
01:21:06.939 --> 01:21:09.272
and sulphur!
It's great for the skin!


749
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.814
Are you sure she works here?

750
01:21:11.981 --> 01:21:13.772
I was told she was here...

751
01:21:13.939 --> 01:21:16.189
Yes... hustling!

752
01:21:18.356 --> 01:21:19.856
Well, that's possible.

753
01:21:20.481 --> 01:21:22.897
Are you engaged to her?

754
01:21:23.064 --> 01:21:26.314
No... not yet!
I'd like to know what she does.


755
01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:30.189
The gentleman is looking for this girl.

756
01:21:30.606 --> 01:21:32.564
He's been asking if we know her.

757
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:34.564
Yes, it's Françoise!

758
01:21:34.731 --> 01:21:37.897
The new girl.
She works in the detonator section.


759
01:21:38.356 --> 01:21:39.814
Isn't her name Cathy?

760
01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:41.647
No... it's Françoise!

761
01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.814
We ate together a couple of times.

762
01:21:46.022 --> 01:21:47.647
This girl works with her.

763
01:21:47.814 --> 01:21:49.231
Look at little Françoise!

764
01:22:01.897 --> 01:22:04.022
No, it's not Françoise.

765
01:22:08.147 --> 01:22:10.564
The photo was his!

766
01:22:13.106 --> 01:22:14.272
Really?

767
01:22:14.606 --> 01:22:16.356
I thought it was a joke.

768
01:22:16.981 --> 01:22:18.314
I'm sorry.

769
01:22:19.856 --> 01:22:21.772
Never mind, I've got the negative.

770
01:22:22.106 --> 01:22:24.397
Anyway, it's not Françoise.

771
01:22:27.147 --> 01:22:28.897
I don't doubt it.

772
01:23:55.356 --> 01:23:56.564
6 minutes.

773
01:24:02.606 --> 01:24:03.981
10 minutes.

774
01:24:09.106 --> 01:24:10.772
15 minutes.

775
01:24:18.272 --> 01:24:20.022
25 minutes.

776
01:25:32.397 --> 01:25:34.397
Report these gentlemen...

777
01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:37.522
for trespassing,
breaking and entering...


778
01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:39.731
and wasting my time which is money!

779
01:25:39.897 --> 01:25:40.606
Calm down.

780
01:25:41.814 --> 01:25:43.189
Don't be a fool.

781
01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.147
They're taking my papers, my car...

782
01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:49.356
my paintings...
I'm not allowed to buy or sell.


783
01:25:49.522 --> 01:25:52.356
No more bars, no restaurants,
no cinemas, nothing!


784
01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:54.147
Everything's forbidden!

785
01:25:54.314 --> 01:25:57.606
They say I can't go anywhere
even to a public piss-house!


786
01:25:57.772 --> 01:26:00.647
Just because of my grandmother's
certificate!


787
01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.856
No, you can't take this one!

788
01:26:03.022 --> 01:26:06.772
It's not merchandise!..
It belongs to me!


789
01:26:07.939 --> 01:26:11.314
Well, Inspector...
you have a warrant, of course?


790
01:26:12.772 --> 01:26:14.147
Here you are.

791
01:26:15.439 --> 01:26:18.772
Try to make him understand...
it's not personal!


792
01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:20.772
And I'm not doing this for fun...

793
01:26:20.939 --> 01:26:22.022
it's the law.

794
01:26:23.064 --> 01:26:24.772
I'm not discussing the law!

795
01:26:24.939 --> 01:26:26.772
But it doesn't apply to me!

796
01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:29.481
I refuse to pay for another man!

797
01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:32.147
The Prefecture reported your case.

798
01:26:32.314 --> 01:26:35.147
But I reported the case
to the Prefecture!


799
01:26:35.397 --> 01:26:36.689
It's nothing to do with me!

800
01:26:38.939 --> 01:26:40.814
That remains to be proved.

801
01:26:41.106 --> 01:26:42.981
It's happened before...

802
01:26:43.147 --> 01:26:44.981
a man comes forward...

803
01:26:45.147 --> 01:26:46.606
the better to hide.

804
01:26:46.939 --> 01:26:49.147
What's that?
I don't follow.


805
01:26:49.314 --> 01:26:51.772
I was speaking in general.

806
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:53.689
Please come, now.

807
01:26:53.856 --> 01:26:56.397
You know the law...
don't make things difficult!


808
01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:58.022
All right.

809
01:27:01.522 --> 01:27:02.522
And the girl?

810
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:04.856
Vanished! She's left her job...

811
01:27:05.022 --> 01:27:07.272
the address she gave was false.

812
01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:09.356
No one knows anything.

813
01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:19.106
Yes. We'll leave.

814
01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:43.772
When did you start writing music?

815
01:27:54.814 --> 01:27:57.022
I'd forgotten.

816
01:28:03.814 --> 01:28:05.564
You play, don't you?

817
01:28:05.731 --> 01:28:06.647
Just a little.

818
01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.022
Try that.

819
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:09.564
What is it?

820
01:28:09.939 --> 01:28:12.356
Our friend.
It seems he composes now...


821
01:28:12.522 --> 01:28:14.147
In the W.C!

822
01:28:27.314 --> 01:28:29.481
What is it? A march?

823
01:28:29.772 --> 01:28:32.939
The way you play, it could be anything!

824
01:28:36.397 --> 01:28:37.939
Stop that!

825
01:28:38.356 --> 01:28:40.481
Have you gone mad?

826
01:28:47.147 --> 01:28:48.689
Go on.

827
01:28:56.272 --> 01:28:59.647
I knew you were an idiot,
but not this much!


828
01:29:05.814 --> 01:29:09.772
If I weren't an idiot,
why would I trust you?


829
01:30:20.272 --> 01:30:24.231
I know where to get
a passport and a visa.


830
01:30:24.439 --> 01:30:26.272
All you need is money!

831
01:30:28.147 --> 01:30:30.897
So, first you find a buyer...

832
01:30:31.064 --> 01:30:32.897
and when your passport's ready...

833
01:30:33.064 --> 01:30:34.481
at the last minute...

834
01:30:34.647 --> 01:30:35.939
we'll sell.

835
01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.689
I will.

836
01:30:39.689 --> 01:30:41.814
Well, yes, of course...

837
01:30:41.981 --> 01:30:43.564
you will sell.

838
01:30:47.939 --> 01:30:50.397
All this... how much is it worth?

839
01:30:50.772 --> 01:30:52.689
About ten million.

840
01:30:55.272 --> 01:30:57.606
Would you settle for...

841
01:30:58.314 --> 01:30:59.939
seven or eight?

842
01:31:06.647 --> 01:31:07.897
Leave it.

843
01:31:08.106 --> 01:31:09.814
Leave it to me.

844
01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:12.772
What are you thinking?

845
01:31:15.064 --> 01:31:16.397
Nothing.

846
01:31:18.856 --> 01:31:21.564
Anyway, I'm not selling
and I'm not going.


847
01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:53.439
Is he yours?

848
01:31:53.606 --> 01:31:55.856
No, I found him here
this morning...


849
01:31:56.022 --> 01:31:57.189
wandering around.

850
01:31:57.356 --> 01:31:59.564
Must be lost, he's starving.

851
01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:02.439
Why don't you take him?
Don't you like dogs?


852
01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:04.231
Yes... other people's dogs.

853
01:32:04.397 --> 01:32:05.772
See you tomorrow.

854
01:32:17.022 --> 01:32:18.814
Call the dog!
He's following me!


855
01:32:19.856 --> 01:32:22.147
I don't know his name.

856
01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:38.647
Go on, get out!

857
01:33:25.814 --> 01:33:27.272
It's incredible!

858
01:33:27.439 --> 01:33:29.022
It looks like the same dog!

859
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:31.106
Absolutely the same!

860
01:33:33.231 --> 01:33:35.856
He was outside all alone...

861
01:33:36.897 --> 01:33:38.897
wandering all night long.

862
01:33:39.731 --> 01:33:43.189
No one could abandon
such a nice dog, could they?


863
01:33:48.606 --> 01:33:49.814
Come on.

864
01:33:49.981 --> 01:33:52.439
Let's see if there's anything to eat.

865
01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:52.772
Robert, listen... I'm going.

866
01:34:55.772 --> 01:34:56.856
Where?

867
01:34:58.856 --> 01:35:00.356
Have some coffee.

868
01:35:00.522 --> 01:35:01.856
Sit down...

869
01:35:21.064 --> 01:35:23.147
Pierre is right, you know!

870
01:35:23.981 --> 01:35:27.897
Three articles today...
on the front page alone!


871
01:35:32.814 --> 01:35:35.731
Apart from the usual cartoons.

872
01:35:45.481 --> 01:35:47.689
This one's pretty funny.

873
01:35:51.022 --> 01:35:52.606
Don't you like it?

874
01:35:55.939 --> 01:35:58.064
Well, perhaps a bit coarse...

875
01:35:58.481 --> 01:36:00.356
but Pierre is right.

876
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:04.647
They're getting the public
ready for something.


877
01:36:06.231 --> 01:36:07.772
It's obvious.

878
01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:12.231
Let's see the ads.

879
01:36:12.689 --> 01:36:14.522
Lost and Found.

880
01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:21.022
No, nothing about the dog.

881
01:36:30.314 --> 01:36:31.522
Shut up.

882
01:37:12.522 --> 01:37:14.647
I read about it in the paper.

883
01:37:16.272 --> 01:37:17.689
Did they all die?

884
01:37:17.856 --> 01:37:19.897
Yes, all five of them!

885
01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:29.814
There was enough T.N.T.
in the sidecars to blow up half Paris...


886
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:39.356
not just the Gestapo Headquarters!

887
01:37:46.481 --> 01:37:49.397
Poor devils, they didn't have much luck.

888
01:38:05.231 --> 01:38:07.356
You should leave now...

889
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:10.731
The guard must've finished his meal.

890
01:38:12.397 --> 01:38:14.397
I'll show you out.

891
01:38:15.731 --> 01:38:17.606
Was he a relative?

892
01:38:18.606 --> 01:38:19.897
A friend?

893
01:38:21.981 --> 01:38:23.606
Don't worry...

894
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:27.147
I'd do the same
if I was a bit younger...


895
01:38:27.689 --> 01:38:29.189
or braver!

896
01:39:12.564 --> 01:39:13.856
You have the papers?

897
01:39:14.022 --> 01:39:16.022
It's been difficult.

898
01:39:16.439 --> 01:39:19.064
Here's your passport.

899
01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.689
De Guigny... an aristocrat?

900
01:39:23.856 --> 01:39:25.356
Probably.

901
01:39:26.314 --> 01:39:28.147
That's the end of the Robert Kleins!

902
01:39:28.314 --> 01:39:30.231
One blown up, and the other...

903
01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:32.522
Here's your ticket to Marseilles...

904
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:35.397
and for the ship.
It sails in two days.


905
01:39:39.439 --> 01:39:40.689
The money?

906
01:39:41.647 --> 01:39:44.731
Here... but at the last minute,
there was...


907
01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:46.606
How much?

908
01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.022
How much... <i>less?</i>

909
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:50.647
Half a million...

910
01:39:50.814 --> 01:39:52.022
Let me explain.

911
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:54.731
The buyer argued again about the gold.

912
01:39:54.897 --> 01:39:57.522
In francs, he would've paid
twice as much.


913
01:39:57.689 --> 01:39:59.897
It doesn't matter,
half a million, well...


914
01:40:00.064 --> 01:40:02.814
it's quite reasonable... correct.

915
01:40:02.981 --> 01:40:04.064
Or almost!

916
01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:05.272
You don't think...

917
01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:08.022
No, of course not!

918
01:40:09.147 --> 01:40:10.189
Should I count it?

919
01:40:10.356 --> 01:40:11.481
Yes, I want you to.

920
01:40:11.647 --> 01:40:13.772
I'll deny you that pleasure.

921
01:40:15.272 --> 01:40:16.481
There you are...

922
01:40:17.064 --> 01:40:18.897
Remember your promise.

923
01:40:19.147 --> 01:40:21.564
Don't worry, I've always wanted a dog.

924
01:40:21.731 --> 01:40:23.314
He isn't just <i>any</i> dog.

925
01:40:23.481 --> 01:40:25.022
You can trust me.

926
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:28.939
Well... goodbye.

927
01:40:35.481 --> 01:40:36.772
Good luck, Robert.

928
01:40:36.939 --> 01:40:38.439
Good luck to you!

929
01:40:38.606 --> 01:40:41.606
I was getting fed up with France.

930
01:40:41.772 --> 01:40:45.522
We're too civilized...
too well-mannered...


931
01:40:45.689 --> 01:40:47.272
too processed!

932
01:40:47.939 --> 01:40:49.481
Cheer up!

933
01:40:49.897 --> 01:40:52.272
You have half a million...

934
01:40:52.439 --> 01:40:54.022
a fine dog...

935
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:56.314
and above all Nicole!

936
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:33.231
Nicole told me...

937
01:41:33.522 --> 01:41:34.897
When will you be back?

938
01:41:35.064 --> 01:41:36.189
I don't know.

939
01:41:36.356 --> 01:41:37.397
Soon?

940
01:41:37.564 --> 01:41:38.856
I don't know.

941
01:41:40.022 --> 01:41:41.147
After the war?

942
01:41:41.314 --> 01:41:42.981
Maybe... I don't know.

943
01:41:43.147 --> 01:41:44.772
What about me?

944
01:41:45.522 --> 01:41:47.522
I really don't know!

945
01:41:52.814 --> 01:41:54.939
The dog... I left him with Pierre.

946
01:41:55.106 --> 01:41:58.022
I don't trust him. 
Look after the dog!

947
01:43:17.647 --> 01:43:20.272
See? You've got the wrong person!

948
01:43:21.606 --> 01:43:22.314
Have I?

949
01:43:23.106 --> 01:43:27.356
No, <i>you're</i> wrong not to trust me.

950
01:43:32.022 --> 01:43:35.189
You don't know it,
but we're friends in a way...


951
01:43:36.481 --> 01:43:38.564
We have an old friend in common!

952
01:43:47.522 --> 01:43:48.939
You know Robert?

953
01:43:49.106 --> 01:43:52.397
Klein,

954
01:43:52.897 --> 01:43:54.522
Poor Robert...

955
01:43:57.272 --> 01:43:59.814
we've left him all alone...

956
01:44:00.272 --> 01:44:03.981
with his ghastly lovesick concierge!

957
01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:07.147
His kangaroo, he called her!

958
01:44:12.356 --> 01:44:14.564
No, you're not a friend of Robert's.

959
01:44:14.731 --> 01:44:16.522
You saw him at the station.

960
01:44:16.689 --> 01:44:18.814
You didn't even say hello!

961
01:44:21.106 --> 01:44:22.981
You're quite right...

962
01:44:23.564 --> 01:44:26.397
I'm not his friend and he's not mine.

963
01:44:32.897 --> 01:44:34.272
Excuse me...

964
01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:22.064
What is it?

965
01:45:22.439 --> 01:45:24.606
Open up it's me, Robert.

966
01:45:30.731 --> 01:45:31.939
Hurry up!

967
01:45:38.272 --> 01:45:39.272
What happened?

968
01:45:39.439 --> 01:45:40.147
Nothing...

969
01:45:40.314 --> 01:45:42.189
May I use the phone?

970
01:45:51.064 --> 01:45:52.731
Go back to bed.

971
01:45:55.606 --> 01:45:57.439
What about your ship?

972
01:45:58.856 --> 01:46:00.564
Maybe I don't need to go now.

973
01:46:00.731 --> 01:46:03.231
I don't get it...
Who are you calling?


974
01:46:04.439 --> 01:46:05.356
Mr Klein!

975
01:46:05.522 --> 01:46:07.606
Again? Isn't he dead?

976
01:46:08.981 --> 01:46:10.981
So you found his number?

977
01:46:11.564 --> 01:46:13.231
It's the same.

978
01:46:14.564 --> 01:46:16.189
He never left.

979
01:46:16.356 --> 01:46:19.856
He put up a <i>To Let</i> sign,
gave my card to the concierge.


980
01:46:20.022 --> 01:46:22.272
And he came home every night!

981
01:46:33.564 --> 01:46:35.022
<i>Who's calling?</i>

982
01:46:42.856 --> 01:46:46.356
<i>I was looking for you too...
I want to talk to you.</i>


983
01:46:46.939 --> 01:46:48.731
Fine. When?

984
01:46:49.481 --> 01:46:50.314
<i>Whenever you like.</i>

985
01:46:50.481 --> 01:46:51.522
Immediately!

986
01:46:51.689 --> 01:46:53.231
<i>All right. Where?</i>

987
01:46:53.397 --> 01:46:55.731
At your place in half an hour.

988
01:46:55.897 --> 01:46:56.981
<i>You know my address?</i>

989
01:46:57.147 --> 01:46:58.897
Yes, I know it.

990
01:46:59.064 --> 01:47:02.481
<i>Good. I'll come down
in half an hour to let you in.</i>


991
01:47:03.772 --> 01:47:05.897
You're not really going?

992
01:47:07.647 --> 01:47:09.106
That's why I came back.

993
01:47:09.272 --> 01:47:11.731
What do you mean? 
It's ridiculous!

994
01:47:11.897 --> 01:47:13.647
Send the police!

995
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:15.356
It's personal.

996
01:47:15.522 --> 01:47:16.564
But if you...

997
01:47:18.522 --> 01:47:20.647
I said it's personal!

998
01:49:09.356 --> 01:49:11.147
I had to do it.

999
01:49:11.981 --> 01:49:13.564
He's a criminal!

1000
01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.439
And I was afraid for you.

1001
01:53:31.772 --> 01:53:34.064
Where do you think they're taking us?

1002
01:53:35.814 --> 01:53:37.147
I don't know.

1003
01:53:38.897 --> 01:53:41.272
But there's no need to worry...

1004
01:53:42.939 --> 01:53:44.272
is there?

1005
01:53:45.147 --> 01:53:47.189
It's just a routine check.

1006
01:53:47.564 --> 01:53:49.022
I don't know.

1007
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:56.481
I hear they'll give us to the Boches
and send us to Germany.


1008
01:53:58.647 --> 01:54:00.564
But it can't be true!

1009
01:54:01.147 --> 01:54:03.814
The French police would never do that!

1010
01:54:05.314 --> 01:54:06.981
Don't you agree?

1011
01:54:07.147 --> 01:54:08.939
I know nothing. 
How could I know?

1012
01:54:09.106 --> 01:54:11.481
This has nothing to do with me!

1013
01:54:13.647 --> 01:54:15.147
I'm sorry.

1014
01:59:14.772 --> 01:59:16.731
Look! All the certificates!

1015
01:59:17.314 --> 01:59:18.522
I'm coming back!

1016
01:59:18.689 --> 01:59:20.481
What're you doing?

1017
01:59:23.939 --> 01:59:25.106
I'm coming back!

1018
02:00:27.939 --> 02:00:29.731
<i>Six hundred Louis.</i>

1019
02:00:30.064 --> 02:00:31.314
<i>Three hundred.</i>

1020
02:00:33.939 --> 02:00:35.647
<i>You must be joking!</i>

1021
02:00:39.564 --> 02:00:42.189
<i>At this price, 
I'd rather keep it.</i>

1022
02:00:43.856 --> 02:00:45.272
<i>As you like.</i>

1023
02:00:48.856 --> 02:00:51.897
<i>It's easy for you
when a man is forced to sell!</i>


1024
02:00:53.106 --> 02:00:55.397
<i>But I'm not forced to buy!</i>

1025
02:00:56.314 --> 02:00:58.772
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

1026
02:01:01.356 --> 02:01:02.897
<i>Three hundred Louis.</i>

1027
02:03:13.064 --> 02:03:16.231
