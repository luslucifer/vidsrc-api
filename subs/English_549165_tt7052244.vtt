this!

Come, let's give them space.

46
00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.669
Perhaps teaching them so young
is an

afford.

What we're doing is dangerous.

We anger those that do not
share the same point of view.

up too much to begin with.

59

But they still anger.

60
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.869
And they want to reclaim
what was once theirs.

You look a mess.

1161
01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:04.825
Thanks.

1162
01:26:13.767 --> 01:26:16.501
GREEN: I told them
not to underestimate you.


1163
01:26:16.503 --> 01:26:18.773
Well it seems they
didn't take your advice.


1164
01:26:19.639 --> 01:26:20.905
What now?

1165
01:26:20.907 --> 01:26:23.945
Well now we return to mourn
the loss of our young friend.


1166
01:26:26.379 --> 01:26:27.581
And to recover.

1167
01:26:28.949 --> 01:26:30.982
But we shall return.

1168
01:26:30.984 --> 01:26:33.719
We must give back all that
the sheriff has taken.


1169
01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.420
The king will hear of this.

1170
01:26:35.422 --> 01:26:36.424
As well he should.

1171
01:26:37.357 --> 01:26:38.793
I only answer to the true king.

1172
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:42.629
Should he ever return.

1173
01:26:44.397 --> 01:26:45.732
I'll send word if he does.

1175
01:27:24.804 --> 01:27:25.740
Why Much?

1176
01:27:27.941 --> 01:27:31.379
He fought and died
for what he believed in.


1177
01:27:35.548 --> 01:27:37.181
And we should be celebrating his
life


1178
01:27:37.183 --> 01:27:38.785
and now dwelling on his death.

1179
01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.153
To live on in our memory.

1180
01:27:42.155 --> 01:27:44.758
Robin, there are still
many things to attend to.


1181
01:27:46.593 --> 01:27:47.628
Perhaps our work can wait.

1182
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:54.369
Let us rest until our
energy returns, do you mind?


1183
01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:58.572
Thank you.

1184
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.808
Don't thank me.

1185
01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:03.678
We would have left you there.
