00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:05.807
<i>Captain's log, stardate 2027.1</i>

2
00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.617
<i>Dear Cindy, I am being
held prisoner on a barren asteroid</i>


3
00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.714
<i>by the evil
Klingon Emperor.</i>


4
00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.763
Oh, will you stop complaining?
It's only for six weeks.


5
00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:22.234
Well, I cannot tell you how I regret
letting you bring that camera.


6
00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:25.982
It's gonna be a good experience for you, Paul.
You'll thank me for it some day.


7
00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:28.550
I'm gonna thank him?
For this?


8
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.256
What kind of life is this?
Being dragged around the world


9
00:00:33.257 --> 00:00:36.290
looking for pot
fragments and aliens?


10
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.261
Well, what can you do.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.701
Cindy, I debuted my act
last week in the workman's mess.


12
00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:48.549
it went over really good.
Uhm...


13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.296
Considering that they
don't speak English, but...


14
00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:53.690
You know, they're
not very hip down here.


15
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.685
I don't know, they didn't even know
who Bullwinkle was.


16
00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.040
Well, what are you gonna do?
Next time I'll pass out cliff notes.


17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.808
Paul.
Quit trying.


18
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.795
You're not going to L.A.
to become a comic, and--


19
00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.682
- Dad, come on.
- No you're not! Paul...


20
00:01:05.683 --> 00:01:08.316
First of all,
you're not funny.


21
00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.021
Second of all, you don't
even know what L.A.'s like.


22
00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:13.537
It's... it's like New Jersey
with earthquakes.


23
00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:15.327
- Hmm.
- Come on, let's go.


24
00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:16.870
The early bird
catches the worm.


25
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:18.813
- Oh, is breakfast ready?
- Doctor! Doctor!


26
00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.769
We found someone
to translate the stone!


27
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.935
Oh, great, Ramon!
Isn't that exciting, Paul?


28
00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:25.236
Yeah, I'm psyched.
Really.


29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.917
What did he say?

30
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.709
He must be chewing
many coca leaf, <i>gato.</i>


31
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.709
He say it reads:
"Beware of Viracocha,


32
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.214
The fire of the gods will bring justice,
from now until the end of time."


33
00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:53.137
Yeah, you should ask him how many
times he's seen <i>The Curse of the Mummy.</i>


34
00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:56.620
- He sure about that, Ramon?
- Oh, he seems very sure, Doctor.


35
00:01:56.621 --> 00:02:00.988
- Nothing about space travelers?
- No, nothing like that.


36
00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:05.409
Okay, Paul. It's time for a little
archaeological field work.


37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.275
Well, you know, Dad, I was never
any good at field trips in school, so...


38
00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:09.728
Paul.

39
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.162
- Dad, I'll just wait--
- Come on, come on.


40
00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:18.484
Paul! Look at this,
it's incredible!


41
00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:20.924
I've got chills!

42
00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:23.137
That's because it's cold, Dad.
This is pneumonia weather.


43
00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.638
- I wanna go home now.
- Shh!


44
00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:28.463
Oh, look!

45
00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:33.757
Look at the stone work.
It's incredible how the stones fit together.


46
00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:39.258
I have a theory, shared by many,
that aliens cut these stones with lasers.


47
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:43.658
- What, what is it?
- Some anorectic Spaniard, Dad.


48
00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:47.324
What's that?

49
00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:51.805
Oh!
Oh, look at this.


50
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.419
This is Inti, the sun god
of the Chimanacos.


51
00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:01.430
Look, Ma, no cavities!

52
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.063
Oh, this is amazing.
You go--you go look over there.


53
00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:08.889
Go on!
Oh, look at this.


54
00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:13.387
This is unbelievable.
It's solid gold!


55
00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:17.799
It's incredible that the Spaniards
didn't cut this off.


56
00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:19.806
What's the matter?

57
00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:21.496
If that's some South American
cockroach, Dad,


58
00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:24.346
bigger than a Cocker Spaniel,
I'm outta here!


59
00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:27.380
Take it easy, Paul.
I'll have a look.


60
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.047
There's nothing here.

61
00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.788
- Over here, Dad.
- What?


62
00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.289
Come here.

63
00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.736
I was right!
It's an alien.


64
00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.534
Dad, you don't know
that he's an alien.


65
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.268
Maybe an illegal alien.

66
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.027
He's just learned Spanish
'cause he's been here so long.


67
00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:54.217
- I mean, what else could he be?
- A Nazi genetic experiment.


68
00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:57.385
- Py... pyramid?
- Definitely an alien.


69
00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:01.491
Uh, go get something
for me to put him in.


70
00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.570
You're gonna be
of big help to me, <i>amigo</i>.


71
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.955
You're gonna prove my theory
that Machu Picchu


72
00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.750
was a control tower
for alien spaceships.


73
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.173
Let the skeptics laugh,

74
00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:16.396
I have my living extra-terrestrial
proof to back me up.


75
00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:18.564
- Right, <i>amigo?</i>
- <i>Amigo!</i>


76
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.821
<i>Amigo.</i>

77
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.060
Hiya, Pablo.

78
00:04:25.486 --> 00:04:27.849
Dad, the only thing I could
find was my duffel bag.


79
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.914
I hope he doesn't mind
living with my underwear.


80
00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.682
Calculated risk.
Here, hold this.


81
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.139
Now, let's see.

82
00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.932
Chocolate, Dad?
You know he might get zits.


83
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.863
- Oh, Milk Duds!
- Ramon?


84
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.248
I better get
a sample of this.


85
00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:59.803
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but it glows in the dark.


86
00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:01.837
Looks like toxic waste.

87
00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:05.097
Dad, he's digging
into the bag.


88
00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:06.976
Aahh...
Good, good.


89
00:05:09.623 --> 00:05:11.123
Ramon!

90
00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:16.855
- Ramon!
- <i>Si</i>, Doctor?


91
00:05:17.304 --> 00:05:20.524
Two things, Ramon: We need
transportation into Lima,


92
00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:22.544
and bribe the workers
to keep quiet.


93
00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.769
- It's not necessary, Doctor.
- How come?


94
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.471
- They all ran away screaming.
- I'm with them, Dad.


95
00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:28.972
Paul.

96
00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.152
- Yeah, whatever.
- <i>Gracias.</i>


97
00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:35.118
Taste good?

98
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.263
Oh, looks like we have
a litterbug alien, Dad.


99
00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:39.764
Not funny.

100
00:05:40.877 --> 00:05:42.377
Milkybar!

101
00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:22.022
<i>United Airlines,
Flight 283 from Dallas,</i>


102
00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:24.123
<i>now arriving
in Gate 7.</i>


103
00:07:26.873 --> 00:07:28.706
- Milk duds.
- Shh!


104
00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:32.873
- Take my wife, please.
- Will you shut up?


105
00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:35.945
He's been hanging around you too much.
He thinks he's a comedian.


106
00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:39.074
Gentlemen, kindly
step aside and disrobe.


107
00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:40.575
Hey, Cindy!

108
00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:46.666
<i>Will passenger William Oliver please
report to the information counter.</i>


109
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:50.634
- Oh, I missed you.
- Oh, I have something for you.


110
00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:53.711
Your very own
Peruvian baseball cap.


111
00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:57.114
- I think she's very good for him.
- Good.


112
00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:59.700
A pointed hat. I've never
had a pointed hat before.


113
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:02.296
Oh, this tape's for you, too.
I didn't have a chance to send it.


114
00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:04.472
How are the Giants doing?
Are they still in first place?


115
00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:05.776
How did the Series
with the Dodgers go?


116
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.965
Simon...
Simon, you're not gonna believe it.


117
00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.780
They won! They won!
Won in a suicide squeeze!


118
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.458
Wow! Who, what--
Shh!


119
00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:14.615
No, that's okay.
I'll get the luggage myself.


120
00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:16.303
- Chili Davis.
- Yeah?


121
00:08:16.304 --> 00:08:20.337
Chili Davis was on third,
and broke for the plate...


122
00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:22.698
Hey, what's in there?

123
00:08:23.414 --> 00:08:27.181
Paul, did you bring me back
a little baby llama?


124
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.614
- Aw, take him out.
- No, no, no, he's fine in here.


125
00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.540
I put a sock in there
for him to play with.


126
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.986
- Dad, he's not a puppy.
- Oh, not a puppy, huh?


127
00:08:34.987 --> 00:08:38.048
- What is it, an anteater?
- No, you're not even warm.


128
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.749
A ground sloth.
Is it marsupial?


129
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.228
- No, I didn't check for a pouch.
- A Bolivian wombat.


130
00:08:48.115 --> 00:08:49.615
Shoot.

131
00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.425
Damn.

132
00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:58.268
Violation!

133
00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:02.092
And it's Cindy.
This is gonna be a great day!


134
00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:45.330
Hi, everybody.
How was the trip, Doc?


135
00:09:46.383 --> 00:09:48.350
Find any alien beings?

136
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.367
No. No, no, Eddie.
Not this time.


137
00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:58.579
I downshifted to 35 by the time
I hit the sign, Sport.


138
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:02.368
Did I say you were
speeding, missy?


139
00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:05.003
And that's
Deputy Sport to you.


140
00:10:05.222 --> 00:10:10.352
I had you at 12dBs over acceptable
noise limits when your car backfired.


141
00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:13.067
Look, I downshifted
to keep from speeding!


142
00:10:13.068 --> 00:10:16.175
I've warned you
to get that tune-up before.


143
00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:19.200
So now maybe you'll start
obeying the environmental standards


144
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.755
that make Sweetwater
such a nice place to live...


145
00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.456
...and raise kids.

146
00:10:25.413 --> 00:10:29.513
- Get a real job.
- Get that tune-up, noise criminal.


147
00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:39.272
If she wasn't so cute,
I'd mace her.


148
00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:59.246
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shhh...


149
00:10:59.474 --> 00:11:03.066
That's all right, bud. That's
all right. Now you're home.


150
00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:05.351
Okay, okay.
I... I think...


151
00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:07.768
He got a little car sick.
Shhh.


152
00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:09.869
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.


153
00:11:18.698 --> 00:11:20.992
What do you mean,
you're a vegetarian now?


154
00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:22.787
Ah, just like
I told you, Paul.


155
00:11:22.788 --> 00:11:25.461
Well, technically,
I'm a cold-blooded veggie.


156
00:11:25.462 --> 00:11:27.990
I just don't like to eat
warm-blooded animals, that's all.


157
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.491
Come on up.

158
00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:32.558
So what does that leave,
snakes and salamanders?


159
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.520
You know, I don't see
what the big deal is.


160
00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:36.269
I mean, I still eat
seafood, you know.


161
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.507
<i>You know, I am
not at all happy about this.</i>


162
00:11:39.508 --> 00:11:41.306
Hey, fella, you ever
watched TV?


163
00:11:41.307 --> 00:11:42.807
TV!

164
00:11:44.388 --> 00:11:46.374
<i>Hi, I'm Cecil Watterman.</i>

165
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:50.090
<i>You know, there must be over 60 brands
of wine cooler on the market now.</i>


166
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:52.280
<i>But there's only
one original:</i>


167
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:57.313
<i>'Cecil's All Natural Wine Cooler',
made out of wholesome California products.</i>


168
00:11:57.314 --> 00:12:00.347
<i>'Cecil's'; it's the real,
real thing!</i>


169
00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:04.994
Uncle Cecil,
what a goof.


170
00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:06.495
What a goof!

171
00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:09.830
I got him some treats.

172
00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:17.133
- You want snacks?
- Snacks.


173
00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:20.920
Oh... he's so cute. Can't we
take him out of the bag now?


174
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:22.789
No, no, no, no!
Leave him in there.


175
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.281
I don't want anybody
finding out about him.


176
00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:26.782
Yeah.

177
00:12:26.852 --> 00:12:28.602
Dad thinks he's an alien.

178
00:12:28.603 --> 00:12:30.880
Yeah, your dad thought
the Osmonds were aliens.


179
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:33.847
Well that hasn't been
disproved yet.


180
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:37.934
I haven't seen anybody
eat so much junk


181
00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:39.898
since that time
you got drunk.


182
00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:41.930
Remember? And you ate
that bar of hash?


183
00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:45.031
Yeah, and you thought
it was a Chunky.


184
00:12:47.882 --> 00:12:49.071
- That's it!
- What?


185
00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:50.512
He's a munchie.

186
00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:54.698
We gotta get the guy a name.
Like, um... Arnold Ziffel.


187
00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:57.466
- The pig on <i>Green Acres?</i>
- Yeah.


188
00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.435
- <i>See, he likes it.</i>
- <i>Oh, no.</i>


189
00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:05.154
Okay, here's the number of the hotel
I'll be staying at tonight.


190
00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:08.304
I'm heading over to the university
to catch Dr. Crowder's lecture.


191
00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:11.819
"Incan Hieroglyphics:
Art Form, or Cosmic Joke?"


192
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.894
- Are you gonna tell him about Arnold?
- Who?


193
00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:15.729
- Arnold.
- Arnold!


194
00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:17.976
Oh, our little friend
in the bag, huh?


195
00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:19.630
Of course I'm gonna
tell him about Arnold.


196
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:22.070
Let him to see for himself.
Draw his own conclusions.


197
00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:25.000
You know, he has hinted
that he believes in alien visitations.


198
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:27.146
It's here in his book,
<i>Conquistador's Journal</i>.


199
00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:29.240
If he backs up
my theory,


200
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:31.739
I'll be able to get
a publisher for my book.


201
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.373
<i>Our money worries
will be over.</i>


202
00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:37.267
- I hope.
- Cool, Dad.


203
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.483
Well, I'm glad you suppert me in this,
Paul, because I need your help.


204
00:13:40.484 --> 00:13:44.016
You must not let Arnold out
of your sight until I get back.


205
00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:46.591
Aw, Dad, it's our first day back,
and you want me to stay at home


206
00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.353
and babysit some alien?

207
00:13:48.354 --> 00:13:51.332
Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do.
You're a betting man, right?


208
00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:52.825
I'll make you a wager:

209
00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:56.617
I'll bet you that you can't
look after Arnold for one day.


210
00:13:56.618 --> 00:14:01.852
If youu win, we'll discuss this budding
comedy career of yours in L.A.


211
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.465
Oh, that's some bet. Now,
what happens if I lose?


212
00:14:04.466 --> 00:14:06.486
You stay here, you go
to community college


213
00:14:06.487 --> 00:14:07.985
and you become
something reputable.


214
00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:12.018
- You really go for the throat, Dad.
- You must keep him safe. And hidden.


215
00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.144
Nobody must
find out about him.


216
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.712
- Okay?
- Okay.


217
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:18.676
I'm depending
on you, Paul.


218
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.787
Oh Lord, what did I ever
do in my past life


219
00:14:40.788 --> 00:14:43.256
to make that goddamn egg
split in two?


220
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.432
Welcome home,
brother Simon.


221
00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:46.929
Uh, you said you
were gonna sell me


222
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.217
your half of the land
when you got back.


223
00:14:49.218 --> 00:14:50.984
Well, here I am.

224
00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:53.869
And, uh... here are
the papers for you to sign.


225
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.703
I'm sorry, Cecil, but uh...
I've changed my mind.


226
00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:02.143
I got this deal pending.
It looks like it could be real big.


227
00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:06.277
Uh... don't mean to
inconvenience you, but, uh...


228
00:15:06.512 --> 00:15:09.379
I could make a lot
of money on this thing.


229
00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:11.569
I don't think I'd be
hard up for money anymore,


230
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.182
so I couldn't consider, uh...
signing those papers.


231
00:15:14.183 --> 00:15:15.683
Excuse me.

232
00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.188
So you wanna
play hardball, huh?


233
00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.725
Okay, brother...
Let's party.


234
00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:31.666
On Channel 3 you get
all the really weird stuff.


235
00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:35.396
And on 24 you get all the old,
really good movies.


236
00:15:35.397 --> 00:15:37.865
Now, this is how you turn it on.
Why don't you try?


237
00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:39.833
- Turn it on.
- Okay.


238
00:15:39.956 --> 00:15:43.248
<i>...home of the Valley's best steaks

Dead LP, man!


251

Oh, I don't care if it's
Burl Ives, "man".

Oh, that's
too bad, Dude.

or you're gonna go back

257
00:16:44.288 --> 00:16:47.788
Now, why, you want money,
and I got the job.


258
00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:51.959
- Now, are you in?
- Oh man, what choice do I got?


259
00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:56.616
Either be a cog in the wheel,
or starve like a dog.


260
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.710
Here, my babies.

261
00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:13.944
Come on, it's chow time.
Come on, Petey.


262
00:17:14.396 --> 00:17:15.806
Come on, Woody.

263
00:17:15.807 --> 00:17:18.522
Come on, boys! Chow, chow.
Chow now.


264
00:17:18.523 --> 00:17:20.611
I know something
that he'd like.


265
00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:22.529
- Arnold?
- Arnold.


266
00:17:27.543 --> 00:17:29.502
Chicks, Arnold.

267
00:17:36.683 --> 00:17:40.245
You know, Paul.
Uhm...


268
00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:43.810
Arnold's amusing himself
with Miss July.


269
00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:49.836
And you and I haven't seen
each other in a very long time.


270
00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:55.398
Are you asking me to
shirk my responsibilities


271
00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:59.136
for some sleazy
teenage sex?


272
00:17:59.137 --> 00:18:01.227
Absolutely.

273
00:18:02.154 --> 00:18:04.737
- Okay.
- Okay.


274
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:14.894
Will you watch what you're doing?
Take off that stupid hat!


275
00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:19.425
Man, the guy on <i>The Wild Kingdom</i>
always wears a hat like this, man.


276
00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:23.666
Man, you act like you've never
seen <i>The Wild Kingdom</i> before.


277
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.243
It's nice to
have you home.


278
00:18:56.448 --> 00:18:59.678
- Paul, not so rough.
- I haven't done anything yet.


279
00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:05.522
- Gross, felt up by a furball.
- Arnold, go downstairs and watch TV!


280
00:19:05.523 --> 00:19:07.123
Now!

281
00:19:40.362 --> 00:19:42.447
Sorry, man.

282
00:19:45.206 --> 00:19:47.007
Snacks!

283
00:20:00.926 --> 00:20:04.636
When I say "now", you break
for the living room and cut him off.


284
00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:06.424
Break what?

285
00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.763
- Uh-oh.
- Now.


286
00:20:10.764 --> 00:20:13.683
- Now what?
- Now go!


287
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:20.341
Gotcha!

288
00:20:25.463 --> 00:20:27.046
Damn!

289
00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.918
It's all your fault!

290
00:20:32.348 --> 00:20:37.081
But there's more than one way
to skin a cat.


291
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:51.485
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.


292
00:20:52.174 --> 00:20:54.445
Come on, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.


293
00:20:55.611 --> 00:20:57.803
- Man, are you sure that thing's a cat?
- Shut up!


294
00:20:57.804 --> 00:20:59.776
And open
that garbage bag.


295
00:21:06.987 --> 00:21:10.526
Oh, man.
Oh wow, man.


296
00:21:10.527 --> 00:21:13.829
Just like capturing a snow leopard
on <i>The Wild Kingdom</i>, man.


297
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.679
Come on,
let's get out of here.


298
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.193
- Hey, you wanna play doctor?
- What?


299
00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:26.994
Did you hear something?

300
00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:30.329
It's probably just Arnold
raiding the refrigerator.


301
00:21:31.168 --> 00:21:33.002
Hit me again.

302
00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:43.840
Hi, goof.

303
00:21:44.379 --> 00:21:48.655
- You guys know each other, huh?
- Don't get wise, punk.


304
00:21:49.047 --> 00:21:51.301
Well, it's been real, Pop,
but I gotta get goin'.


305
00:21:51.302 --> 00:21:53.520
Oh, no you don't.
You ain't finished yet.


306
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.421
You're gonna help me out
with this creature.


307
00:21:55.422 --> 00:21:57.063
But I've got
things to do, man.


308
00:21:57.064 --> 00:22:00.539
I'm going to the Berkeley
Tie Dye and Hacky Sack Festival.


309
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.578
Now, Dude...

310
00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:06.771
Haven't I always treated you
like you was my own stepson?


311
00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:08.599
But I <i>am</i> your stepson.

312
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.835
I know, and I always treated you
like you was, didn't I?


313
00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:13.363
Yeah, you always treated me
like a stepchild.


314
00:22:13.364 --> 00:22:14.396
Yes.

315
00:22:14.397 --> 00:22:18.043
Well, you guard him with your life,
or you won't have one!


316
00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:22.154
- You threatenin' me, Pop?
- Yes.


317
00:22:23.016 --> 00:22:24.212
Okay.

318
00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:27.362
I'm going to the bus station now
to pick up your mother.


319
00:22:27.432 --> 00:22:28.807
Now you watch him.

320
00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.399
Scum.

321
00:22:44.837 --> 00:22:46.521
Where are you?

322
00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:49.002
I'm over here
behind the watermelon!


323
00:22:49.053 --> 00:22:50.553
That's not a watermelon!

324
00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:54.514
No!

325
00:23:01.202 --> 00:23:03.827
Hey, cut it out,
you furry wimp!


326
00:23:04.343 --> 00:23:08.299
It took my mom 4000 books
of green stamps to get that.


327
00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:23.667
Cut it out.

328
00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:30.202
I said, cut it out!

329
00:23:31.396 --> 00:23:32.641
Take that.

330
00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:42.295
Oh!

331
00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:08.754
Oh, man, my Dead records!
You are history, pal!


332
00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:09.998
You're not laughing
anymore, are you, pal?


333
00:25:47.677 --> 00:25:48.967
Got you now!

334
00:26:56.607 --> 00:26:59.649
- Sure missed ya.
- Did you?


335
00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:03.779
- The bed got awful cold at night.
- Cecil!


336
00:27:04.408 --> 00:27:06.489
You sweet thing, you.

337
00:27:07.444 --> 00:27:10.357
Oh! How's my baby
Dude doin'?


338
00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:12.735
Oh, fine. Fine.
Just fine.


339
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:15.390
One thing I'll never know,
though, honey,


340
00:27:15.512 --> 00:27:18.578
is why you agreed to
adopt that worthless kid


341
00:27:18.707 --> 00:27:20.714
when you left that little
con cousin of yours.


342
00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:24.394
I don't know. I guess
I just felt sorry for him,


343
00:27:24.504 --> 00:27:27.035
'cause he was so
ugly and stupid.


344
00:27:38.253 --> 00:27:39.753
What's happenin', man?

345
00:27:41.165 --> 00:27:43.733
Hostile little bastard.

346
00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:47.212
Incredibly bad energy, man.

347
00:27:49.604 --> 00:27:50.965
Oh, yeah.

348
00:27:52.743 --> 00:27:57.144
- Rudy, how you feelin', man?
- Leo, what'd I have to drink last night?


349
00:27:57.231 --> 00:28:00.202
- I feel sick.
- Hey. Hey, Rudy.


350
00:28:00.326 --> 00:28:03.018
Where are we?
Look at this kitchen!


351
00:28:03.158 --> 00:28:05.924
You ever see such
an ugly kitchen? Ugh!


352
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.633
Eh, let's go.
Come on!


353
00:28:08.717 --> 00:28:13.208
♪ Truckin', I got my
chips cashed in ♪


354
00:28:13.308 --> 00:28:16.289
♪ Keep a-truckin', yeah ♪

355
00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:21.992
Crank it all the way
up, man!


356
00:28:25.628 --> 00:28:27.660
Arnold, come home!

357
00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:30.009
You know, it
serves you right.


358
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.382
It serves you right for
letting him read that magazine.


359
00:28:32.482 --> 00:28:35.303
You act like I had him freebasing
at the Playboy Mansion or something.


360
00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:36.902
You just didn't have
any time, that's all.


361
00:28:36.975 --> 00:28:39.412
You know, I can't believe
your lack of faith in me.


362
00:28:39.512 --> 00:28:41.295
You never used
to be this way.


363
00:28:41.395 --> 00:28:43.242
I never said
lovin' was easy.


364
00:28:47.407 --> 00:28:49.820
Good shooting, man!
You got it!


365
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:51.409
Bullseye!

366
00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:54.552
- Where'd those guys come from?
- I don't know.


367
00:29:05.588 --> 00:29:07.388
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go around.


368
00:29:07.526 --> 00:29:09.669
You keep 'em occupied.
Okay?


369
00:29:09.884 --> 00:29:11.249
Okay.

370
00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:15.049
Hey, fellas!

371
00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:23.937
- Look at that.
- Shake that thing, baby.


372
00:29:23.987 --> 00:29:26.924
Must be jelly, cause
jam don't shake like that!


373
00:29:27.747 --> 00:29:29.713
Paul, hurry up.
They're drooling.


374
00:29:30.138 --> 00:29:31.607
Take it all off!

375
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:37.171
Good job.

376
00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.530
We got 'em.

377
00:29:39.682 --> 00:29:41.911
How come you've never
danced like that for me?


378
00:29:43.174 --> 00:29:46.642
- Wow, my eardrums!
- Man, this stuff stinks!


379
00:29:47.755 --> 00:29:49.920
- What's so funny?
- Come on waste 'em, man.


380
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.520
Blow 'em away!
Come on!


381
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.560
- Yeah, show 'em.
- Yeah.


382
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.206
No, Arnold, come on now.
Give me the--give me the gun.


383
00:29:57.278 --> 00:29:59.440
Don't listen to him. Get him
in the kneecaps, come on!


384
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.220
- Give me the gun.
- No way, Jose.


385
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.285
- I'm getting pissed off.
- Back off, man!


386
00:30:05.988 --> 00:30:09.352
- Jeez, what an attitude.
- Okay, pull!


387
00:30:11.815 --> 00:30:13.111
They're gone.

388
00:30:20.543 --> 00:30:22.099
Come on,
we gotta get them.


389
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:34.847
Great shots, man!

390
00:30:42.204 --> 00:30:45.312
- Step on it!
- I can't push any harder.


391
00:30:45.381 --> 00:30:47.174
Hey, let me do it, huh?

392
00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:51.599
I didn't know you could
drive like Starsky and Hutch.


393
00:30:53.903 --> 00:30:56.298
Hey, watch the smoke, man.
You're gonna give me cancer.


394
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.550
Buzz off.

395
00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.574
Check out the scenery, dudes.
We go to New Jersey!


396
00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:13.490
Go ahead.
Make for the county line.


397
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.283
And I'll
blow your tires out!


398
00:31:38.985 --> 00:31:41.195
Déjà vu.

399
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:46.652
You think just 'cause my dad's away
at the riot control convention,


400
00:31:46.752 --> 00:31:49.552
that's your cue to
run wild in the streets?


401
00:31:49.652 --> 00:31:53.963
Uh, Eddie... You're not
gonna believe this, but uh...


402
00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:56.252
Cindy's dad is
in the CIA.


403
00:31:56.717 --> 00:31:59.303
And we're on a mission
of national security.


404
00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:02.552
That ugly, yellow car
is full of Ruskie spies


405
00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:04.970
with stolen secrets
from the Silicon Valley.


406
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.195
- Really?
- Yeah.


407
00:32:07.323 --> 00:32:09.802
Need some help?
Come on, let me help!


408
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.600
I was an Eagle Scout,
you know.


409
00:32:13.784 --> 00:32:16.801
Okay, but this
is classified information.


410
00:32:19.694 --> 00:32:21.896
We have
reason to believe


411
00:32:21.944 --> 00:32:25.045
that they are planning
to blow up Golf Land,


412
00:32:25.222 --> 00:32:27.498
and discredit the American
way of life.


413
00:32:28.056 --> 00:32:29.315
Okay.

414
00:32:31.405 --> 00:32:32.756
Thanks, Paul.

415
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.540
How did you know my dad
was in the CIA?


416
00:32:43.585 --> 00:32:45.542
His decoder ring
gave him away.


417
00:32:46.335 --> 00:32:47.869
What are you readin'?

418
00:32:48.894 --> 00:32:52.350
Oh, this is the latest issue
of <i>Insult Celebrities.</i>


419
00:32:52.488 --> 00:32:55.390
There is a interview
with Ozzy Osbourne.


420
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.423
"How Today's Dating is Rough
On Sensitive Guys."


421
00:32:59.523 --> 00:33:01.984
I don't know why
you read trash like that.


422
00:33:02.084 --> 00:33:05.047
It's educational, honey.
Look:


423
00:33:05.147 --> 00:33:08.049
- Here's your astroscope.
- Oh, my ass.


424
00:33:08.171 --> 00:33:11.179
Let's see, Cancer...
"You have little patience


425
00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.567
with the eccentricity
of neighbors."


426
00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:16.641
"Home is where
your heart is."


427
00:33:29.797 --> 00:33:31.677
All right!

428
00:33:37.917 --> 00:33:40.635
Check out that
poon freak, man.


429
00:33:50.434 --> 00:33:52.638
- Come on!
- Yeah!


430
00:34:16.523 --> 00:34:18.270
Lady.

431
00:34:29.702 --> 00:34:34.388
Ain't gonna take that from
no American Motors car.


432
00:34:38.768 --> 00:34:41.022
Head for the hills, mama.

433
00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:44.328
Crazy punks!
Let them have guns!


434
00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:51.703
You idiots!

435
00:34:52.192 --> 00:34:53.652
Like it?

436
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:56.691
Let's go, man.

437
00:34:56.764 --> 00:34:59.767
You're gonna pay for this, you
furry little wimps!


438
00:35:00.994 --> 00:35:03.891
- Guess we showed her.
- He-hey, we the Munchies!


439
00:35:05.593 --> 00:35:09.408
- Which way did they go?
- They went that a-way! Get 'em!


440
00:35:30.479 --> 00:35:34.206
Watch those short stops.
You'll squish my due.


441
00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:35.713
Well, what the...?

442
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:47.242
What a mess!
Conchita will be furious!


443
00:35:57.096 --> 00:36:01.374
Oh no, my
Jaylynn plastic Eros!


444
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.990
Elvis!

445
00:36:06.611 --> 00:36:08.428
Dude!
Oh!


446
00:36:09.368 --> 00:36:13.525
- Is--is he dead?
- Sure looks it.


447
00:36:13.964 --> 00:36:16.774
Look at this mess!
My G--


448
00:36:18.782 --> 00:36:20.746
Oh my God!

449
00:36:20.996 --> 00:36:23.566
Oh my God!
Look!


450
00:36:23.996 --> 00:36:26.494
No one kills
my tropical fish and lives!


451
00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:28.495
What's happened here!

452
00:36:28.595 --> 00:36:31.412
Your son blew it again,
that's what's happened!


453
00:36:31.512 --> 00:36:33.845
I figured out a way to
force Simon to sell his land,


454
00:36:33.945 --> 00:36:35.157
but he blew it!

455
00:36:35.257 --> 00:36:37.606
- He let the creature get away!
- What creature?


456
00:36:37.706 --> 00:36:40.410
I dunno, some bad thing
Simon found in Peru.


457
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.858
We gotta get Big Ed
back up here, pronto!


458
00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:46.026
Let's get Eddie! Eddie!
We saw his car at Golf Land.


459
00:36:46.126 --> 00:36:48.225
Oh, hell, he's dumber
than his old man.


460
00:36:48.325 --> 00:36:51.617
But, I guess we're stuck with him
until Big Ed gets back.


461
00:36:53.362 --> 00:36:56.892
Clearview, please.
Number of the Easy 8 Motel.


462
00:37:05.538 --> 00:37:07.038
Hey! Hey!

463
00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:10.709
Hey!

464
00:37:29.499 --> 00:37:30.999
Okey!

465
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.188
What is going on?

466
00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:04.046
- Which way'd they go?
- That way!


467
00:38:07.357 --> 00:38:09.021
When will they see it?

468
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:12.283
When will they know that it's
the evil, red tide of communism


469
00:38:12.383 --> 00:38:14.305
that's destroying
the American fiber,


470
00:38:14.405 --> 00:38:17.029
erroding the American
way of life as we know it?


471
00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:20.770
Those Soviet scums
make me wanna barf!


472
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:24.821
You guys must think
you're pretty funny!


473
00:38:24.921 --> 00:38:27.959
Sending me off to guard
Golf Land, huh, wise guy?


474
00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:31.259
Those Ruskie spies must have
a high-level informant in the CIA.


475
00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:34.011
But we really need your help
to get a line on Dude's car.


476
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.016
I mean, can't you put out,
like, a dragnet or something?


477
00:38:36.116 --> 00:38:38.025
That's an APB, Cojak.

478
00:38:45.419 --> 00:38:47.074
Eddie!

479
00:38:47.269 --> 00:38:50.453
Eddie, what are you doing
to stop the impending disaster?


480
00:38:50.553 --> 00:38:53.736
With all due respect,
Mr. Watterman,


481
00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:57.216
might I remind you
that I am the police officer,


482
00:38:57.316 --> 00:39:00.053
and you are the civilian.

483
00:39:00.853 --> 00:39:03.396
I don't intend to let
red man anarchy rule the day


484
00:39:03.496 --> 00:39:05.766
just 'cause my dad's away.

485
00:39:06.056 --> 00:39:07.837
What impending disaster?

486
00:39:07.937 --> 00:39:11.069
The disaster that
wrecked my condo,


487
00:39:11.169 --> 00:39:15.009
ate my tropical fish,
and killed Dude Macindosh.


488
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:18.442
- My beloved stepson!
- There's been a murder?


489
00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:20.364
My first murder!
What a great day!


490
00:39:20.464 --> 00:39:21.904
I'm on the case!

491
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.983
- Where am I going?
- My place, you lunkhead!


492
00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:30.519
This is all your fault.

493
00:39:30.762 --> 00:39:33.621
If you wouldn't have kidnapped,
none of this would have happened.


494
00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:35.823
Yeah, now there's four of them,
and they're all mad as hell.


495
00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:37.550
I don't know what
you're talking about.


496
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.878
The point is, we gotta
track this thing down, pronto!


497
00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:43.303
Now are you and your bimbo
in this with me, or what?


498
00:39:43.403 --> 00:39:46.438
Who are you calling bimbo,
you polyester cowboy?


499
00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:51.014
Who are you calling
polyester cowboy, you...


500
00:39:51.114 --> 00:39:53.452
...cheap dime store floozy?

501
00:39:53.552 --> 00:39:56.284
If I wasn't such a lady,
I would pop you one.


502
00:39:56.384 --> 00:39:58.211
We'll find Arnold
for ourselves, Cecil.


503
00:39:58.311 --> 00:40:01.215
Oh, just what I expected
from today's youth.


504
00:40:01.315 --> 00:40:03.943
There ain't a real
American among ya!


505
00:40:04.043 --> 00:40:05.862
And it's the fourth
of July, too.


506
00:40:05.962 --> 00:40:09.130
Cecil, if you're such a patriot,
how come your Space Chewy Sticks


507
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.527
are the official snack food
of the Russian commienauts, huh?


508
00:40:11.627 --> 00:40:15.517
Because you gotta bribe those bums
at NASA to get an endorsement.


509
00:40:15.617 --> 00:40:18.468
With the commies, you just
cut them in for a percentage.


510
00:40:18.568 --> 00:40:22.143
But I ain't got time standing 'round here
talkin' snack food economics to you two.


511
00:40:22.243 --> 00:40:25.130
Come on, Melvis, let's roll!
We gotta meet Big Ed.


512
00:40:27.932 --> 00:40:30.977
I want your chromosomes checked
before we have kids.


513
00:40:38.551 --> 00:40:40.251
I'm coming to get you!

514
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.032
Whoa, would you look
at those beautiful babes?


515
00:40:51.132 --> 00:40:53.246
I'm going down
for a closer look.


516
00:40:54.522 --> 00:40:56.037
Oh, catch those beach balls!

517
00:41:00.817 --> 00:41:03.294
I only dated him
to get to Whitney.


518
00:41:03.558 --> 00:41:06.629
Who is merely
the richest guy in town.


519
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.579
Bitchin' dudes!

520
00:41:17.048 --> 00:41:19.545
Hey, isn't that Dude's old
ugly, yellow car?


521
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:20.789
Who?

522
00:41:20.889 --> 00:41:23.256
You know, that burnout,
Santa Cruz Deadhead?


523
00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:25.873
He hangs with, uh, Denise.
The loadie chick?


524
00:41:25.973 --> 00:41:29.238
Oh, Denise, whose sister's
the salad bar manager


525
00:41:29.338 --> 00:41:30.636
at Western Beef Land.

526
00:41:30.736 --> 00:41:32.242
Yeah, you know Dude.

527
00:41:37.793 --> 00:41:39.670
What are those things?

528
00:41:40.479 --> 00:41:42.969
Dude's pals
from Santa Cruz?


529
00:41:45.218 --> 00:41:46.472
A piranha!

530
00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:48.776
See you later, Terry.

531
00:41:52.134 --> 00:41:55.020
That's my favorite
bathing suit, you creep!


532
00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:57.210
Hiya, sweetheart!

533
00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:00.103
Oh, no!
Oh!


534
00:42:00.203 --> 00:42:01.877
See you around, Amy!

535
00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:03.797
Wait, what's your sign?

536
00:42:05.442 --> 00:42:06.960
Come to papa!

537
00:42:12.952 --> 00:42:14.752
It's okay.
It's okay.


538
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.248
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- Okay.


539
00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:34.785
Okay, come on, Arnold.

540
00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:37.436
Come on, I'd recognize
those beady eyes anywhere.


541
00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:39.012
Thanks for the help, Amy.

542
00:42:39.712 --> 00:42:41.207
You're the one to talk.

543
00:42:41.307 --> 00:42:43.974
Besides, I'm not missing cheerleading
camp because of you.


544
00:42:44.074 --> 00:42:45.364
Come on.

545
00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:52.372
He must have gotten away
down the pipes.


546
00:42:53.298 --> 00:42:55.117
Well, now he
could be anywhere.


547
00:42:55.547 --> 00:42:57.108
What were those things?

548
00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:00.288
Uh, tourists from...
...from Nevada.


549
00:43:12.728 --> 00:43:16.635
Buddy Holly Johnson,
quit lightin' them firecrackers!


550
00:43:16.735 --> 00:43:20.158
Don't want you to become
another holiday statistic, now.


551
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:27.919
Hey, bro, I smell ice cream.
Where is it?


552
00:43:41.814 --> 00:43:44.380
<i>Buddy Holly,
you're too quiet.</i>


553
00:43:44.745 --> 00:43:46.470
<i>What are you up to?</i>

554
00:43:48.952 --> 00:43:51.491
<i>Buddy Holly,
just answer me!</i>


555
00:43:56.263 --> 00:43:57.763
What are you--
Aahh!


556
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.305
Wow! God,
what are they?


557
00:44:02.013 --> 00:44:03.221
Get back here.

558
00:44:04.325 --> 00:44:06.476
All right, everybody inside.
Inside.


559
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:10.447
Idiot!

560
00:44:15.848 --> 00:44:17.248
Quick, into the cooler.

561
00:44:18.242 --> 00:44:20.404
Hey, look out!
Get outta the way!


562
00:44:23.073 --> 00:44:25.653
How long does it take
to fix a tire?


563
00:44:44.077 --> 00:44:46.772
Would've helped
if you'd had a jack.


564
00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:57.305
I don't know,
I can't decide.


565
00:44:57.405 --> 00:44:59.652
What should I get,
vanilla or chocolate?


566
00:45:00.923 --> 00:45:02.704
- I'm going for Mocha Chip.
- Stay there.


567
00:45:03.864 --> 00:45:06.286
Get back.
Get back in the car.


568
00:45:21.063 --> 00:45:22.511
Looters, huh?

569
00:45:36.176 --> 00:45:37.886
Hey, guys, wait for me!

570
00:45:40.911 --> 00:45:44.219
Who's gonna
clean this mess up?


571
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.088
- Oh, Bob!
- I'm fine.


572
00:45:47.188 --> 00:45:48.450
Huh?

573
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.600
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm fine.


574
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.871
Oh, by the way, I'm Marge.
And this is Bob.


575
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:55.982
And this is little
Buddy Holly.


576
00:45:56.082 --> 00:45:58.603
Next time I wanna
try Rum Raisin.


577
00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:01.385
We'll be at
the hospital soon.


578
00:46:01.485 --> 00:46:05.981
- What were those things?
- Aliens, mom! I already told ya.


579
00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:08.918
- Adults are talking.
- Forget the hospital.


580
00:46:09.018 --> 00:46:10.628
It's not too bad.

581
00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:15.356
Bob was mauled by a grizzly
in Yellowstone once.


582
00:46:15.456 --> 00:46:18.472
- Well, I hope it wasn't Yogi.
- I've had worse.


583
00:46:18.572 --> 00:46:21.371
I was mauled by a grizzly
in Yellowstone once.


584
00:46:27.371 --> 00:46:30.042
Can't you guys
move it out any faster?


585
00:46:37.156 --> 00:46:39.431
I'm sorry, little
dead Dude.


586
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:43.903
I'll never forget
the first time I saw him.


587
00:46:44.003 --> 00:46:47.214
He was eleven, and I said to myself:
"That boy looks like a chicken."


588
00:46:47.314 --> 00:46:49.103
- And now he's gone.
- That's all right, darlin'.


589
00:46:49.203 --> 00:46:51.306
Please, come on.
Daddy'll give you a massage.


590
00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:55.333
Poor thing, I mean, he always
made a mess, but he meant well.


591
00:46:55.433 --> 00:46:57.343
- Didn't he, honey?
- Yes, darlin'.


592
00:46:57.443 --> 00:46:59.515
We'll all be
in heaven some day.


593
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.014
You know, I think
I've got something here.


594
00:47:02.114 --> 00:47:03.314
You do?

595
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:07.311
You know, it is really such a turn-on
when you take charge and everything.


596
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:08.820
- Really?
- Uh-huh.


597
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.225
If I would've know that, I would've
taken a Dale Carnegie course years ago.


598
00:47:13.098 --> 00:47:15.021
You know, it says here
that there are legends


599
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:18.110
that the high priests were able
to inanimate objects to life.


600
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:22.146
They used, and I quote:
"The fire of the gods."


601
00:47:22.246 --> 00:47:25.613
"Once brought to life, the objects
then supposedly had regenerative powers,


602
00:47:25.713 --> 00:47:27.964
which made them
unable to be destroyed."


603
00:47:28.064 --> 00:47:29.264
Hm.

604
00:47:30.194 --> 00:47:32.448
What do you think
"fire of the gods" means?


605
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:35.993
I don't know. But you can probably
rule out microwaves.


606
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:38.531
Regenerative powers.

607
00:47:38.904 --> 00:47:41.505
That's how come there's four of them.
It's like with the worm.


608
00:47:41.605 --> 00:47:44.181
You have one worm; you cut it
in half, you have two worms.


609
00:47:44.446 --> 00:47:46.577
We've gotta warn everybody not to cut them.
Otherwise, we're gonna have


610
00:47:46.677 --> 00:47:49.758
hundreds of Munchies running
around Sweetwater stealing junk food.


611
00:47:50.265 --> 00:47:53.694
- This little piggy had roast beef.
- No, stop it.


612
00:47:53.794 --> 00:47:55.417
This little piggy had none.

613
00:47:55.517 --> 00:47:57.632
And this little piggy
was a bad little piggy,


614
00:47:57.732 --> 00:47:59.705
then wee-wee-wee'd
all the way home!


615
00:47:59.805 --> 00:48:01.200
- Stop it.
- Oh, honey...


616
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.376
If only I'd been
a better stepmother.


617
00:48:03.476 --> 00:48:05.312
Oh darling, you were
a wonderful mother.


618
00:48:05.412 --> 00:48:07.865
- You want a bite?
- No, honey, I don't want.


619
00:48:07.965 --> 00:48:10.293
I just want want
another bite of you.


620
00:48:10.393 --> 00:48:13.305
- I love you so much.
- Maybe I'll have a pink one.


621
00:48:14.746 --> 00:48:16.084
All right!

622
00:48:17.118 --> 00:48:21.195
- Where's the insurrection?
- It's Big Ed! Thank the Lord.


623
00:48:21.295 --> 00:48:23.734
That door's made out
of redwood, you jackass!


624
00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:26.609
Welll, the place is destroyed.
What do you need the door for?


625
00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:29.955
Oh, Big Ed,
we missed you!


626
00:48:30.729 --> 00:48:33.204
- Where'd you get the riot gear?
- You like it?


627
00:48:33.304 --> 00:48:36.282
I borrowed it from some buddies of mine
on the Tactical Assault Squad.


628
00:48:36.382 --> 00:48:38.342
Uh, darlin', why don't you
go get us a cool drink?


629
00:48:38.442 --> 00:48:40.144
Would you mind, sweetheart?
Eddie, give her a hand.


630
00:48:40.244 --> 00:48:43.212
She's deeply bereaved.
Go on, darlin', thank you.


631
00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:46.090
Wha...?

632
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.124
We've got a full-blown
crisis on our hands!


633
00:48:48.224 --> 00:48:49.842
Hm. Eddie couldn't
handle it, huh?


634
00:48:49.942 --> 00:48:53.012
You know he graduated in the
top 70% of debuty school?


635
00:48:53.112 --> 00:48:55.445
You know, boss, I was having
a great time at this convention.


636
00:48:55.545 --> 00:48:57.414
I got this riot gun here,
and I got--


637
00:48:57.514 --> 00:48:59.959
Would you just forget that!
Now listen!


638
00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:02.333
If those creatures get
into the underground caves,


639
00:49:02.433 --> 00:49:04.439
people are gonna find out
that I have been storing


640
00:49:04.539 --> 00:49:07.181
barrels of toxic waste
under the town.


641
00:49:07.281 --> 00:49:09.218
Now, if I go down,
you come with me!


642
00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:15.136
A real meeting
of the minds, huh?


643
00:49:15.236 --> 00:49:17.561
Cecil, I found some more
stuff out about those creatures.


644
00:49:17.661 --> 00:49:18.869
I don't wanna hear it.

645
00:49:18.969 --> 00:49:21.233
I'll take care of those hostile
little bastards in my own way.


646
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:23.394
- But Cecil, you gotta listen--
- Oh, honey, it's almost 9 o'clock!


647
00:49:23.494 --> 00:49:27.132
We've got to get over to Golf Land
for those ribbon cutting ceremonies.


648
00:49:27.232 --> 00:49:29.148
Oh, heaven's sakes, I haven't
memorized all of my speech yet!


649
00:49:29.248 --> 00:49:30.568
Cecil, you gotta
listen to me.


650
00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:32.217
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- I'm not sure what to do!


651
00:49:32.317 --> 00:49:34.767
From the beginning
of recorded time...


652
00:50:10.719 --> 00:50:12.599
Throughout history,

653
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:16.993
civilization has advanced
for the good of all men,


654
00:50:17.326 --> 00:50:22.510
when a few great men
have had bold, new visions,


655
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.214
and the courage
to carry them out.


656
00:50:25.378 --> 00:50:26.378
<i>Yeah!</i>

657
00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:32.990
But behind every great man,
there is a loving and dedicated woman


658
00:50:33.455 --> 00:50:35.479
who fills his days...

659
00:50:36.964 --> 00:50:38.385
...and nights...

660
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:41.441
...with a love
that is so profound,


661
00:50:42.632 --> 00:50:45.664
so deep that it
urges him on


662
00:50:45.764 --> 00:50:48.406
to fulfill even
his wildest dreams.


663
00:50:49.614 --> 00:50:51.765
Caesar had his Cleopatra,

664
00:50:52.334 --> 00:50:54.775
Napoleon had his Joséphine,

665
00:50:55.292 --> 00:50:58.021
and Sonny had his Cher.

666
00:50:58.734 --> 00:51:00.514
But luckiest of all:

667
00:51:00.942 --> 00:51:03.115
I've had my Melvis.

668
00:51:10.379 --> 00:51:13.659
You know...
They laughed at me


669
00:51:13.759 --> 00:51:19.150
when I said I would build the world's
first 36-hole miniature golf course.


670
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.533
But I didn't listen
to other people.


671
00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:24.059
I followed my dream.

672
00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:28.023
And with this fine lady's help,
I have brought this Valley


673
00:51:28.123 --> 00:51:31.576
36 holes of miniature golf.

674
00:51:31.637 --> 00:51:37.124
I officially now declare
Melvis' Miniature Golf Land...


675
00:51:37.224 --> 00:51:39.823
...officially open!
Yessir!


676
00:51:49.712 --> 00:51:51.476
Go on, get out there
and put, put.


677
00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:54.339
Put your little hearts away.

678
00:51:54.958 --> 00:51:57.608
It's on the house today, folks.
On the house.


679
00:51:57.931 --> 00:52:01.035
Okay, last ten!
- Loser's buyin' pizza.


680
00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:03.056
Hope you brought
your money this time.


681
00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:06.976
Wait till the guys see this!
Ohh!


682
00:52:07.076 --> 00:52:09.460
- Hey, look at the dudes over there!
- You're cheating!


683
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.069
- I didn't cheat!
- Come on, do it again.


684
00:52:12.169 --> 00:52:13.909
Come on, come on.

685
00:52:14.009 --> 00:52:16.338
- Whoa!
- Whoops.


686
00:52:16.838 --> 00:52:18.135
Ready to lose?

687
00:52:56.198 --> 00:52:58.772
- Oh, gross!
- What was that?


688
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.824
They're here!

689
00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:07.619
Dad, it's them!
They're here!


690
00:53:07.719 --> 00:53:09.392
It's them, they're...
Dad!


691
00:53:09.492 --> 00:53:11.747
Shh, buddy, I'll make par
if I get this one.


692
00:53:11.847 --> 00:53:15.024
But Dad, you don't understand!
It's them!


693
00:53:15.124 --> 00:53:17.090
- Dad, they're here!
- Shh!


694
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.937
- Dad!
- Shh!


695
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:22.964
Look!
Dad, look!


696
00:53:23.064 --> 00:53:25.983
Look, Daddy!
Oh, Dad, look!


697
00:53:44.534 --> 00:53:46.623
I guess it's just
not my day, huh, Marge?


698
00:53:47.228 --> 00:53:49.464
- Is it bad, Bob?
- No, no, honey.


699
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:52.032
The mace took my mind
off the pain.


700
00:54:02.061 --> 00:54:03.315
Give me that.

701
00:54:04.472 --> 00:54:05.678
Somebody's gonna
hear us.


702
00:54:06.569 --> 00:54:07.846
Shut up.

703
00:54:09.994 --> 00:54:11.816
Get it off me,
get it off me!


704
00:54:12.852 --> 00:54:14.093
Hurry up!

705
00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.210
I didn't bring any money!

706
00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.608
And you ask if me
if I brought my money?


707
00:54:28.823 --> 00:54:30.542
It wasn't my fault, Dad.
Honest.


708
00:54:30.642 --> 00:54:33.392
Well, son, I think
you've done a pretty fair job


709
00:54:33.492 --> 00:54:35.079
of maintaining
order here.


710
00:54:35.179 --> 00:54:36.988
Gee, thanks, Dad!

711
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.835
Ed!
Get over here!


712
00:54:43.153 --> 00:54:45.799
Well, do something,
you dumb motherf--


713
00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:50.191
Cecil! Don't you say the F word!
There's a lady present!


714
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.752
Just don't stand there!
Plug 'em!


715
00:54:52.852 --> 00:54:54.671
Code blue, Dad!

716
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:56.271
Right, son!
Cover my rear!


717
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:58.600
All right, let me do
a little beat on them now!


718
00:54:58.756 --> 00:55:00.056
All right!

719
00:55:04.294 --> 00:55:07.545
- You can't kill 'em with guns.
- Yeah, and how do you know that?


720
00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:09.904
Because I read this book
called <i>The Conquistador's Journal.</i>


721
00:55:10.004 --> 00:55:13.160
- Bull!
- Look, these things regenerate.


722
00:55:13.316 --> 00:55:14.817
You can't kill 'em!

723
00:55:14.917 --> 00:55:17.000
If you cut 'em up, there's
just gonna be more of them.


724
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.245
I don't believe that crap!

725
00:55:19.345 --> 00:55:22.385
- Do you, Melvis?
- Well...


726
00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.048
I don't know.

727
00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:27.159
Hiya, Toots.

728
00:55:27.796 --> 00:55:29.367
Hold this, son.

729
00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.565
- Good shootin', Ed.
- I knew you had it in you, Big Ed.


730
00:55:38.665 --> 00:55:42.212
- Oh, thanks, Melvis.
- It's party time.


731
00:55:42.312 --> 00:55:46.383
Those ugly little things are wearing
all of Dude's stuff!


732
00:55:46.483 --> 00:55:49.775
Denise tie dyed that scarf
for my baby's birthday!


733
00:55:49.875 --> 00:55:51.719
Take it easy, honey.

734
00:55:51.819 --> 00:55:53.368
I'll fix their wagon!

735
00:55:55.055 --> 00:55:56.719
- Give me your helmet, Ed.
- I can't, it's a loaner.


736
00:55:56.819 --> 00:55:58.139
I said, give me
your helmet!


737
00:56:01.001 --> 00:56:02.075
Honey, give me
them scissors.


738
00:56:02.175 --> 00:56:04.278
Are you crazy? You're gonna
cut 'em up and make more of them!


739
00:56:04.378 --> 00:56:05.878
Get outta my way!

740
00:56:07.868 --> 00:56:10.757
- Hey, honkey.
- Yeah, gotcha, sucker!


741
00:56:10.864 --> 00:56:12.593
Bullseye, man!
Bullseye!


742
00:56:12.859 --> 00:56:14.987
Yeah, got him.
Good shot!


743
00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:18.767
He doesn't know
what he's doing.


744
00:56:20.263 --> 00:56:21.763
Thank you.

745
00:56:25.123 --> 00:56:28.846
Well, I guess that shows you
what you don't know.


746
00:56:29.341 --> 00:56:31.211
Well, not exactly.

747
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:34.694
Say what?

748
00:56:41.011 --> 00:56:43.576
Cecil, I told you not to cut them up!
Now there are seven of them!


749
00:56:43.676 --> 00:56:44.857
No, get out of my sight!

750
00:56:44.957 --> 00:56:47.111
Ed, arrest him, and
take his floozy with him!


751
00:56:47.605 --> 00:56:49.105
<i>¡Ándale, ándale!</i>

752
00:56:50.611 --> 00:56:52.337
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!


753
00:56:52.437 --> 00:56:54.127
- Hey, come here.
- Yeah, come on!


754
00:56:55.528 --> 00:56:59.197
- Were does this drain pipe lead to?
- Uh, the Watterman Wash.


755
00:56:59.511 --> 00:57:00.890
We gotta get to the factory

756
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.698
before they get into
the underground storage areas.


757
00:57:03.895 --> 00:57:05.813
Can I have
my helmet back?


758
00:57:05.913 --> 00:57:08.311
Is your head gettin' cold?

759
00:57:09.442 --> 00:57:10.858
Hey, Eddie...

760
00:57:13.281 --> 00:57:16.303
You're not really gonna
take us to the big house, are you?


761
00:57:17.311 --> 00:57:19.579
Where?
Oh--oh, jail?


762
00:57:19.679 --> 00:57:21.382
Yeah, I am.

763
00:57:21.482 --> 00:57:24.133
A good lawman
always follows orders.


764
00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:26.062
No, no, no,
a really good lawman


765
00:57:26.162 --> 00:57:28.450
thinks on his feet
and make snap desicions


766
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.432
whenever unforseen
circumstances should arise.


767
00:57:31.532 --> 00:57:33.544
I'm not listening to you!

768
00:57:33.944 --> 00:57:38.730
Y'all... already lied to me
about those Ruskie spies.


769
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:41.197
Look for Cher, man.
I think she did a movie once.


770
00:57:41.297 --> 00:57:44.316
- I wanna see naked women!
- Maybe she was naked?


771
00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:50.183
I-I-I don't know why you wanna
go back to Golf Land.


772
00:57:50.283 --> 00:57:53.130
Oh, scene
of the crime, clues...


773
00:57:53.622 --> 00:57:57.242
All that macho cop stuff.
You know.


774
00:57:58.022 --> 00:57:59.743
Yeah, I know.

775
00:57:59.928 --> 00:58:01.644
I'm the lawman,
remember?


776
00:58:03.199 --> 00:58:04.496
Yeah.

777
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.509
Couldn't we stop
at Pizza Land?


778
00:58:14.609 --> 00:58:16.198
Sure could go for
a couple of slices right now.


779
00:58:16.298 --> 00:58:20.015
Yeah, I'm hungry. They don't
serve meals on the bus, you know.


780
00:58:20.115 --> 00:58:23.196
I've told you, we can't!
We've got to get to the factory!


781
00:58:23.296 --> 00:58:25.670
Just get a couple
of takeout slices!


782
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.630
Pizza gives me gas.

783
00:58:36.744 --> 00:58:38.101
Whoa!

784
00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:41.252
- A 430 Double Stroke Z in progress!
- What's that?


785
00:58:41.352 --> 00:58:44.283
Ah, these punk vandals
from the junior high!


786
00:58:44.383 --> 00:58:47.726
Eddie? I just love
all the macho cop stuff!


787
00:58:48.998 --> 00:58:51.067
Under state stature 35.C,

788
00:58:51.167 --> 00:58:54.029
civilians may be duly deputized
in times of natural emergency


789
00:58:54.129 --> 00:58:55.826
and/or stress.
You're the one!


790
00:59:03.959 --> 00:59:07.139
Aw, nothing but stupid
educational films, man.


791
00:59:08.526 --> 00:59:10.338
Look at that,
a couple of heroes.


792
00:59:24.039 --> 00:59:26.425
That's it!
Electricity.


793
00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.097
"The fire of the gods."

794
00:59:32.162 --> 00:59:33.752
It's just like he said
in the journal.


795
00:59:33.852 --> 00:59:35.469
- Let's split, man.
- There goes Arnold!


796
00:59:39.578 --> 00:59:40.801
Come on.

797
00:59:41.585 --> 00:59:43.302
I hate Western
Beef Land.


798
00:59:43.402 --> 00:59:46.205
Besides, the <i>Enquirer</i> says that
red meat clogs your plumbin'.


799
00:59:46.305 --> 00:59:48.774
They got the best salad bar
in the state, Big Ed.


800
00:59:48.874 --> 00:59:50.931
Well, now you're talkin'.
Salad will set you free!


801
00:59:51.031 --> 00:59:52.648
All right, all right,
all right!


802
00:59:52.748 --> 00:59:55.548
We'll go through the drive-through
at Burger Land, and that's it,


803
00:59:55.648 --> 00:59:56.899
okay?

804
00:59:58.199 --> 01:00:00.450
Burgers give me indigestion.

805
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.371
Well, that's 'cause
they clog your plumbin'.


806
01:00:02.471 --> 01:00:03.772
Oh, Lord.

807
01:00:10.421 --> 01:00:13.360
God, it's cold down here.
It reminds me of Peru.


808
01:00:17.887 --> 01:00:20.271
I wonder why this place
is all lit up.


809
01:00:21.942 --> 01:00:25.374
I'm sure Mr. Watterman's got
a perfectly reasonable explanation.


810
01:00:25.516 --> 01:00:28.224
Probably a
perfectly sleazy one.


811
01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:30.477
He is my role model,
you know.


812
01:00:30.577 --> 01:00:32.174
Yeah, he would be.

813
01:00:32.572 --> 01:00:33.772
Look.

814
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.888
They must have gone
this way, come on.


815
01:01:12.774 --> 01:01:14.335
A little help.

816
01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:19.193
Heeelp!

817
01:01:34.085 --> 01:01:35.421
It's okay.

818
01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.398
Move 'em out.

819
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:41.182
You okay, bud?

820
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.070
Which one, Paul?

821
01:01:52.683 --> 01:01:54.400
You guys go down here,
and I'll try down here.


822
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.346
We'll meet back here
in five minutes.


823
01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.445
All right.
Let's synchronize our watches.


824
01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:03.144
- I've got 10:57.
- Check.


825
01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:04.678
Check!

826
01:02:28.628 --> 01:02:30.283
You little twerps
ain't finished yet?


827
01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:34.060
Geez, how am I ever
gonna be regional manager


828
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.869
with employees
like you, huh?


829
01:02:37.042 --> 01:02:38.339
Come on!

830
01:02:38.439 --> 01:02:41.064
Snap it up,
short-stops, okay?


831
01:02:47.377 --> 01:02:51.283
It's guys like Butcher that give Burger
Land managers a bad name.


832
01:02:51.383 --> 01:02:54.878
Forget him.
He's got socialisation problems.


833
01:02:54.978 --> 01:02:56.858
And bad skin.

834
01:02:57.002 --> 01:02:59.540
This is Cecil Watterman.
Ordering.


835
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.716
Oh, wait! I don't want the patty,
I just want a bun with, uhm...


836
01:03:03.816 --> 01:03:06.406
- With lettuce and tomato.
- And I'd just like a fruit bowl, please.


837
01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:08.936
No, you don't want a fruitbowl,
'cause strawberries give you hives.


838
01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:10.330
- Well, I thought pineapples--
- No, I--


839
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.941
That's it!

840
01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:14.453
Give me three Double Melvis Burgers,
three large fries,


841
01:03:14.553 --> 01:03:17.119
and three Solar Shakes.
Do you copy?


842
01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:19.622
<i>I said, do you copy?</i>

843
01:03:19.722 --> 01:03:21.574
<i>Three Double Melvis Burgers,
three large fries,</i>


844
01:03:21.674 --> 01:03:23.571
<i>and three Solar Shakes.
Do you get it?</i>


845
01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:26.563
Sounds like he's got a broken
squawk box or somethin'.


846
01:03:26.663 --> 01:03:30.117
This is Cecil Watterman.
And I'm ordering!


847
01:03:30.217 --> 01:03:32.434
Three Double Melvis Burgers,
three large fries,


848
01:03:32.534 --> 01:03:34.652
and three Solar Shakes,
do you copy?


849
01:03:34.752 --> 01:03:36.097
And a pickled pickle.

850
01:03:50.302 --> 01:03:51.952
Where is it?

851
01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:54.846
Hello?
Hey...


852
01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.696
It's slow tonight.

853
01:03:57.579 --> 01:04:00.959
I thought you said this night
manager was going places.


854
01:04:01.059 --> 01:04:04.087
He's going, all right.
He's gonna find himself another job!


855
01:04:04.187 --> 01:04:06.195
Butcher, where are you?

856
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:07.830
Butcher, you here?

857
01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:09.655
We didn't get
our Melvis Burgers.


858
01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:13.079
I don't like these games now, Butcher.
This is Cecil Watterman!


859
01:04:13.514 --> 01:04:16.095
- What's happening?
- Hit them lights, Ed.


860
01:04:16.195 --> 01:04:19.443
Aah! Ed, you better have a cold.
Just kidding.


861
01:04:27.214 --> 01:04:28.494
Let's split, man.

862
01:04:32.811 --> 01:04:35.082
They're in the caves
now, for sure!


863
01:04:35.182 --> 01:04:36.741
We gotta get
to the factory!


864
01:04:38.993 --> 01:04:40.896
We didn't get our order.

865
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:52.486
You know, Cindy, Paul is a really
cool dude and everything, but, uh...


866
01:04:52.986 --> 01:04:55.327
He's not exactly what you would call
a go-getter kind of guy.


867
01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:58.585
- You know what I'm saying?
- What are you talking about, Eddie?


868
01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:02.521
Well, it just seems to me that an incredibly
happening chick like yourself


869
01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:05.273
would go out with a guy
with a real future.


870
01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.691
Like who, Eddie?

871
01:05:09.123 --> 01:05:11.653
I'm going back to deputy school
to be recertified


872
01:05:11.753 --> 01:05:14.157
as a special weapons
expert, and...


873
01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:19.930
Then I figure I'll probably retire from my
wild and totally hot bachelor life, and...


874
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:23.795
...settle down and buy myself
a little place near Video Land.


875
01:05:23.895 --> 01:05:28.771
Eddie, I'd rather become a nun
and join a convent.


876
01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:31.371
I got no problems
with my wife working.


877
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:46.700
Let me help you
out, Melvis.


878
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.254
Oh, I think I feel dizzy.

879
01:05:49.354 --> 01:05:51.897
- What's the matter?
- I'm starving!


880
01:05:51.997 --> 01:05:53.772
If we don't get some food
in this woman soon


881
01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:55.263
I won't be
held responsible!


882
01:05:55.363 --> 01:05:57.726
- Come on, you two.
- So hungry!


883
01:05:58.735 --> 01:05:59.997
Come on!

884
01:06:09.157 --> 01:06:10.412
What was that?

885
01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:17.275
Eddie?
Eddie?


886
01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:18.875
Eddie, speak to me.

887
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.686
Hey, honey bun!
How about a kiss?


888
01:06:43.444 --> 01:06:47.045
Hey, don't run away.
We're gonna treat you nice.


889
01:06:55.437 --> 01:06:58.756
I don't wanna point any fingers,
but if we'd stopped at that salad bar,


890
01:06:58.856 --> 01:07:01.885
we would have gotten those
to-go styrofoam containers.


891
01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:05.636
It would have taken five,
many ten minutes at most.


892
01:07:05.736 --> 01:07:08.691
Here.
Have some Cheese Squeeze.


893
01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:12.448
Ew! Cheese Squeeze
makes my eyeballs itch!


894
01:07:13.234 --> 01:07:14.472
Hm.

895
01:07:17.645 --> 01:07:20.235
You get a four-carbon
rush doing this straight.


896
01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:22.070
Hey, boss,
you got some crackers?


897
01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:25.740
Well, we gotta look
on the bright side.


898
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.207
I read fasting
improves your karma.


899
01:07:32.065 --> 01:07:34.157
Do you think
Sushi Land delivers?


900
01:07:36.608 --> 01:07:37.883
You okay, Eddie?

901
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:40.416
Put me in
the game, coach.


902
01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:44.168
Next play, Eddie.
Next play.


903
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:53.811
Cecil, let me in!

904
01:07:59.567 --> 01:08:02.624
- Hey, honey, what's your hurry?
- My heart is palpatatin'.


905
01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:05.090
- They almost got in here.
- It's all right.


906
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:08.036
Hey, come back here!
Wait for me!


907
01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:10.997
Later, man.

908
01:08:13.768 --> 01:08:17.157
Shopping hours
are now over.


909
01:08:22.947 --> 01:08:26.499
- I have closet-phobia!
- Oh no, me too!


910
01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:28.996
Now don't panic, sweetheart.
Daddy's here.


911
01:08:29.096 --> 01:08:31.447
Now don't be scared.
Here--here, take my hand.


912
01:08:31.547 --> 01:08:35.834
- There. Is that better?
- Yeah. Thanks, boss.


913
01:08:35.934 --> 01:08:37.367
Get outta here!

914
01:09:15.092 --> 01:09:16.521
Oh, great.

915
01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:18.805
- Oh, now what?
- What do we do now?


916
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.605
Ah, let's find something to eat.
Come on!


917
01:09:57.912 --> 01:10:02.925
I am coming.
Arnold's going to come to see you.


918
01:10:03.025 --> 01:10:04.778
<i>Ma chérie?</i>

919
01:10:05.703 --> 01:10:08.030
Here I am coming!

920
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.979
<i>Ma chérie...</i>

921
01:10:19.942 --> 01:10:21.688
Hit it!

922
01:10:40.257 --> 01:10:42.313
Oh my God,
they're gonna multiply.


923
01:11:27.335 --> 01:11:28.484
Gotcha!

924
01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:35.710
<i>Bonjour,</i> Cindy.

925
01:11:37.503 --> 01:11:41.473
Come to me, my little peach blossom.
My sweet little darling.


926
01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:43.832
My little <i>soufflé chocolat</i>.

927
01:12:54.633 --> 01:12:56.022
Paul!

928
01:13:01.479 --> 01:13:04.444
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


929
01:13:04.544 --> 01:13:07.469
- What about you?
- I'm okay.


930
01:13:07.569 --> 01:13:08.681
I was so scared.

931
01:13:53.087 --> 01:13:54.948
Should we take it
back to Simon?


932
01:13:55.048 --> 01:13:56.915
I gotta bring him something.

933
01:13:57.353 --> 01:13:58.809
He's counting on me.

934
01:14:01.568 --> 01:14:03.794
Wait a minute.
Think I found something.


935
01:14:07.024 --> 01:14:08.823
It was on the panel
all the time.


936
01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:10.699
It was right here
all the time!


937
01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.908
Can you imagine, honey?
It was here.


938
01:14:14.008 --> 01:14:15.905
We were looking all over the place,
and it was right here.


939
01:14:16.005 --> 01:14:17.651
Boy, I'll be darned.

940
01:14:18.297 --> 01:14:20.356
- Hallelujah.
- Yeah, praise the Lord.


941
01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.723
- Are you all right, darling?
- Mm-hmm!


942
01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:31.711
- Who's there?
- <i>Dad.</i>


943
01:14:31.811 --> 01:14:32.827
Dad who?

944
01:14:33.938 --> 01:14:35.399
Daddy?

945
01:14:36.007 --> 01:14:37.830
- <i>Hey, Eddie.</i>
- Yes, sir!


946
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:39.800
- <i>It's Cecil Watterman.</i>
- How are you doing, sir?


947
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.431
<i>I want you to hit
that emergency switch.</i>


948
01:14:42.531 --> 01:14:44.433
You mean this red button
right here on the side, sir?


949
01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:46.506
<i>No, no, no.
On the other side.</i>


950
01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.282
There's nothing over here,
Mr. Watterman.


951
01:14:52.382 --> 01:14:55.220
<i>On the side side,
you idiot!</i>


952
01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:03.943
Good work.
Way to go, son.


953
01:15:04.043 --> 01:15:05.202
Thanks, Dad.

954
01:15:05.453 --> 01:15:07.111
What happened
to them monsters?


955
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.372
Smashed to smithereens,
no thanks to you.


956
01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:10.690
Here, look at this.

957
01:15:13.951 --> 01:15:16.746
Asbestos for tater tot mix?

958
01:15:19.609 --> 01:15:22.826
Agent Orange for
mandarin/orange wine cooler?


959
01:15:22.926 --> 01:15:25.731
Well, I guess it's been a long night
for all of us, you probably wanna--


960
01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:27.546
Cecil, you scum!

961
01:15:27.646 --> 01:15:30.056
Cow snacks are made
with toxic waste!


962
01:15:30.156 --> 01:15:32.954
But it's harmless, Paul.
Can't hurt anybody.


963
01:15:33.054 --> 01:15:36.269
I've treated it all with my
secret neutralizing mix.


964
01:15:36.369 --> 01:15:38.607
Of course, I wouldn't want it
to get around, you know...


965
01:15:38.707 --> 01:15:40.448
Trade secrets and everything.

966
01:15:40.548 --> 01:15:42.420
You know, Paul, I've been
thinking. You know...


967
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.638
I could use a smart fella
like you around the factory.


968
01:15:45.738 --> 01:15:49.657
Put you in charge of the endangered
species spunge cake division.


969
01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:52.558
What's your answer, nephew?

970
01:15:52.658 --> 01:15:53.814
Just this.

971
01:15:57.674 --> 01:16:01.256
Oh, sweetheart!
Oh, honey.


972
01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.400
I want him arrested
for assault, Ed!


973
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.335
All right, darling.

974
01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:08.298
What are you doing?
You work for me!


975
01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:09.724
Not no more.

976
01:16:09.824 --> 01:16:12.119
You never did tell me
about poison in the food.


977
01:16:12.219 --> 01:16:14.857
You can't arrest me!
I've seen those movies


978
01:16:14.957 --> 01:16:18.383
about what happens to
nice girls like me in prison.


979
01:16:18.483 --> 01:16:21.451
Hey. You're already
on your way to the big house


980
01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:24.459
so why don't you just
put a sock in it, Toots!


981
01:16:24.559 --> 01:16:27.338
Look what happened
to Linda Blair!


982
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:33.160
Eddie, can you give us
a ride to my house?


983
01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.075
No problem, good buddy!

984
01:16:39.684 --> 01:16:42.785
<i>I'll give you that recommendation
to deputy school if you want.</i>


985
01:16:42.885 --> 01:16:46.169
My name carries
a lot of weight around there.


986
01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.044
I finished highest
in parking enforcement.


987
01:16:49.665 --> 01:16:51.359
Well, I might
take you up on that.


988
01:16:51.459 --> 01:16:53.831
Looks like I'm gonna
be around here for a while, so...


989
01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:55.282
See you later, Eddie.

990
01:16:55.382 --> 01:16:56.703
Bye, Eddie.

991
01:16:59.464 --> 01:17:00.887
What happened
to Arnold?


992
01:17:00.987 --> 01:17:02.664
- Aw, Dad, you're
never gonna believe--


993
01:17:02.764 --> 01:17:04.269
- It was all Cecil's fault.
- Simon!


994
01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:06.496
I've never seen one
this well preserved.


995
01:17:06.596 --> 01:17:09.097
You didn't have to hand me
that line about aliens.


996
01:17:09.197 --> 01:17:10.953
I would've come anyway.

997
01:17:11.053 --> 01:17:13.561
This Dr. Crowder from
the archaeology institute.


998
01:17:13.661 --> 01:17:15.519
This is my son, Paul,
and his friend, Cindy.


999
01:17:15.619 --> 01:17:17.389
Pleased to meet you.
May I?


1000
01:17:17.489 --> 01:17:18.823
Sure.

1001
01:17:22.606 --> 01:17:24.167
Amazing.

1002
01:17:24.267 --> 01:17:27.260
I can offer you $25,000
for this statue.


1003
01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:32.357
It's yours.

1004
01:17:32.457 --> 01:17:34.173
What an addition
this is going to make


1005
01:17:34.273 --> 01:17:36.525
to the university's
natural history museum.


1006
01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:38.420
Some will say I've paid
too much, of course.


1007
01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.661
But for something like this?
Unbelievable.


1008
01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:43.770
Well, I-I guess
I've lost the bet.


1009
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:46.521
I'll go tomorrow and enroll
in community college, and...


1010
01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:48.041
Dad?

1011
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:50.185
Oh, son!
I forgot to tell you.


1012
01:17:50.285 --> 01:17:53.192
Do you remember that sample
that I took at the temple?


1013
01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.848
- Yeah.
Well, I had it analyzed.


1014
01:17:54.948 --> 01:17:56.336
And it's some sort
of toxic waste.


1015
01:17:56.436 --> 01:17:58.719
But there are no elements in it
that are known on Earth!


1016
01:17:58.819 --> 01:18:00.639
So you mean,
Machu Picchu is really...


1017
01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:03.278
An alien toxic waste dump!

1018
01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:05.825
I've got my new bestseller:

1019
01:18:05.925 --> 01:18:10.317
<i>Machu Picchu:
Toxic Waste Dump of the Gods.</i>


1020
01:18:11.683 --> 01:18:14.189
Hey, you could probably
use that in your act, huh?


1021
01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:16.571
You mean I don't
have to go to college?


1022
01:18:16.671 --> 01:18:18.168
Oh, no.

1023
01:18:18.802 --> 01:18:21.605
A good mind
is a terrible thing to waste.


1024
01:18:21.705 --> 01:18:23.813
Not funny, Dad.
Not funny.


1025
01:18:29.656 --> 01:18:30.936
So...

1026
01:18:31.036 --> 01:18:32.446
How do you feel
about L.A.?


1027
01:18:33.154 --> 01:18:34.699
It's like New Jersey...

1028
01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.150
...with earthquakes.

1029
01:18:46.947 --> 01:18:48.247
<i>Amigo!</i>

1030
01:21:30.718 --> 01:21:33.151
Come on, Tina,
that's enou--
