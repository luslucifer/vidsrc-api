1
00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:15.188
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.


2
00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:17.274
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:20.069
His office is the first door
on the left.


4
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.445
Thank you.

5
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.633
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:41.136
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:43.346
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.934
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.


9
00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:48.729
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.606
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?


11
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.609
No problem at all. I made the
trip in three and a half hours.


12
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.779
That's very good time.

13
00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:58.698
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:00.700
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.118
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.872
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.


17
00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:05.999
- Susie.
- Sure.


18
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.958
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:09.710
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:21.682
Mom?

21
00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:23.684
Yeah?

22
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.689
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?


23
00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:29.650
Sure I do.

24
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.819
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:35.824
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.204
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.


27
00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:44.542
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.


28
00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:48.381
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:49.173 --> 00:04:50.132
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:52.677
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.


31
00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:55.722
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:56.098 --> 00:04:58.434
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.


33
00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:00.853
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:03.398
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03.648 --> 00:05:05.566
I just don't.

36
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.196
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.165
We're all going to have
a real good time.


38
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.009
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.


39
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.643
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:18.813
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.


41
00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.948
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:25.280
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.


43
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.490
I'd like you to take him
around soon as we're through.


44
00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:29.625
Fine.

45
00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:32.162
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.398
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.294
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.094
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.966
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.


50
00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.142
This ought to be
quite a change for you.


51
00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.875
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.676
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...


53
00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:52.477
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:54.919
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:57.717
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.124
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.


57
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.789
Then we close down completely
until the following May.


58
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.800
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?


59
00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:12.464
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.


60
00:06:12.677 --> 00:06:15.271
It would be. The problem
is the enormous cost...


61
00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.040
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.


62
00:06:18.684 --> 00:06:20.413
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.985
It gets 20 feet of
snow during the winter.


64
00:06:23.188 --> 00:06:26.420
There's just no way to make
it economically feasible...


65
00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:28.560
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:31.128
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:33.893
...there was very little
interest in winter sports.


68
00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.971
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.


69
00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:41.733
It's certainly got plenty of that.

70
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:43.138
That's right.

71
00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.172
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

72
00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:48.049
...about what the job entails?

73
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.386
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:52.597 --> 00:06:55.267
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.


75
00:06:55.517 --> 00:06:58.854
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...


76
00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.064
...and depreciation
which can occur.


77
00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:03.735
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...


78
00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:07.906
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...


79
00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:10.785
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:13.872
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.


81
00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:17.209
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:20.505
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.


83
00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:23.841
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...


84
00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.720
...is a tremendous sense of isolation.

85
00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:32.476
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.


86
00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.981
I'm outlining a new writing project.

87
00:07:36.357 --> 00:07:39.652
Five months of peace
is just what I want.


88
00:07:40.444 --> 00:07:42.197
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:45.616
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:47.576
...solitude...

91
00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:49.370
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.500
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:55.002
Not for me.

94
00:07:55.503 --> 00:07:58.674
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?


95
00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:01.593
They'll love it.

96
00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:03.095
Great.

97
00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:09.185
Before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:12.856
...there's one other thing I
think we should talk about.


99
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.568
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:17.320
...but it's been known
to give a few people...


101
00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.739
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:22.076
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:24.620
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...


104
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:28.792
...about the tragedy we had up
here during the winter of 1970.


105
00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.378
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:34.007 --> 00:08:35.675
My predecessor in this job...

107
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:39.680
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.


108
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.350
He came up with his wife and two
little girls of about eight and ten.


109
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.605
He had a good employment record,
good references.


110
00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:49.065
And from what I've been told, he seemed...

111
00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:51.943
...like a completely normal individual.

112
00:08:52.237 --> 00:08:54.531
But at some point during the winter...

113
00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:58.410
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.


114
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.955
He ran amuck...

115
00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:06.544
...and killed his family with an ax.

116
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.468
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...


117
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.974
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.


118
00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:20.019
The police thought...

119
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:24.274
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.


120
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.528
A kind of claustrophobic
reaction which can occur...


121
00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:31.908
...when people are shut in
together over long periods of time.


122
00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:38.331
That is...

123
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.084
...quite a story.

124
00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:42.878
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:43.963 --> 00:09:47.342
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.


126
00:09:47.634 --> 00:09:49.302
But it did.

127
00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:55.101
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.


128
00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:58.147
I certainly can.

129
00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:01.233
I also understand
why your people in Denver...


130
00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:03.695
...left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.574
Obviously, some people
can be put off...


132
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:11.871
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.


133
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.959
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.


134
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.840
And as far as my wife
is concerned...


135
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.927
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.


136
00:10:25.178 --> 00:10:27.931
She's a confirmed ghost story...

137
00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:30.559
...and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.153
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?


139
00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:43.783
He already did.

140
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.912
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.


141
00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:05.308
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?


142
00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:09.062
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.


143
00:11:09.354 --> 00:11:12.399
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.


144
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.109
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:17.030
Right. It's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.366
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:23.787
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?


148
00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:25.747
I don't know.

149
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.378
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.


150
00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:33.047
I don't want to.

151
00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:35.007
Please.

152
00:11:36.177 --> 00:11:37.345
No.

153
00:11:37.637 --> 00:11:39.764
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:12.056
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.


155
00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.765
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.639
Good boy.

157
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.348
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:32.843
...when you were brushing
your teeth...


159
00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:36.046
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...


160
00:12:36.258 --> 00:12:41.026
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?


161
00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:45.027
No.

162
00:12:46.103 --> 00:12:48.594
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?


163
00:12:49.173 --> 00:12:50.470
Yes.

164
00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:55.239
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?


165
00:12:59.452 --> 00:13:02.081
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."


166
00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:08.523
Can you remember
what you were doing...


167
00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:11.665
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?


168
00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.931
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:16.603 --> 00:13:18.970
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:22.777
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.


171
00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:25.479
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:31.819
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?


173
00:13:34.492 --> 00:13:35.720
Why not?

174
00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:38.825
Because he hides.

175
00:13:39.565 --> 00:13:41.227
Where does he go?

176
00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:44.132
To my stomach.

177
00:13:46.172 --> 00:13:49.074
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?


178
00:13:53.147 --> 00:13:55.809
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.


179
00:13:58.454 --> 00:13:59.887
That's fine.

180
00:14:00.656 --> 00:14:02.453
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.058
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...


182
00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:09.630
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?


183
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:10.959
Do I have to?

184
00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:13.433
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:13.638 --> 00:14:16.402
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.


186
00:14:16.608 --> 00:14:18.735
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:29.655
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.


188
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.227
- Please.
- Thank you.


189
00:14:39.102 --> 00:14:43.472
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.


190
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:47.701
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.


191
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.578
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:55.787 --> 00:14:56.776
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:57.455 --> 00:14:58.480
I know.

194
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.386
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:00.594 --> 00:15:03.460
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.


196
00:15:03.663 --> 00:15:06.224
And they look much worse
than they are.


197
00:15:06.767 --> 00:15:09.429
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:09.636 --> 00:15:13.732
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.


199
00:15:13.942 --> 00:15:18.811
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.


200
00:15:19.614 --> 00:15:22.584
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...


201
00:15:22.786 --> 00:15:25.755
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:27.947
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:31.920
...we can always think about
having some tests done.


204
00:15:34.532 --> 00:15:36.796
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.133
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.238
Only about three months.

207
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.811
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.


208
00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:52.616
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....


209
00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:53.884
Tony.

210
00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:58.048
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?


211
00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:02.495
Let's see....

212
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.760
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...


213
00:16:05.969 --> 00:16:08.666
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.


214
00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:11.371
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:15.512
He didn't like it too much
at first.


216
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:19.013
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....


217
00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:24.322
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.


218
00:16:25.326 --> 00:16:27.726
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:30.557
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.297
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:39.799
It was just one of
those things, you know.


222
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:42.000
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.778
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:45.983 --> 00:16:49.317
...and he came home
about three hours late.


225
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.182
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.


226
00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:59.693
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...


227
00:16:59.898 --> 00:17:04.199
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.


228
00:17:04.404 --> 00:17:07.464
It's just the sort of thing you do

229
00:17:07.674 --> 00:17:09.699
...you know, in a park
or in the street.


230
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.440
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:13.648 --> 00:17:16.276
...my husband just used
too much strength...


232
00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:19.079
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:26.653
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...


234
00:17:26.897 --> 00:17:29.457
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.


235
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:31.601
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:33.133
And he didn't.

237
00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:37.832
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.


238
00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:09.058
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.


239
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.899
Dad?

240
00:18:18.735 --> 00:18:20.445
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.993
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:25.828 --> 00:18:28.706
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.


243
00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:30.584
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:36.172
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?


245
00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:41.428
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.


246
00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:45.308
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:51.481
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.


248
00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:54.944
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.


249
00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:59.407
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.


250
00:19:00.492 --> 00:19:03.412
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.707
They had to, in order to survive.

252
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.169
Jack.

253
00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:09.462
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:09.712 --> 00:19:13.925
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.


255
00:19:14.175 --> 00:19:16.845
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:17.054 --> 00:19:19.473
He saw it on the television.

257
00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:52.011
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.


258
00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:54.974
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.


259
00:19:55.224 --> 00:19:57.142
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.


260
00:19:57.393 --> 00:20:00.479
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.


261
00:20:00.729 --> 00:20:03.316
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.


262
00:20:03.567 --> 00:20:06.403
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.


263
00:20:06.654 --> 00:20:08.322
ls your family
having a look around?


264
00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:11.910
No, my son's
discovered the games room.


265
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.205
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.


266
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:17.708
ln view of all we have
to cover today...


267
00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:21.588
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.


268
00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:24.591
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.


269
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.553
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:35.645 --> 00:20:38.023
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:40.650
It's beautiful.

272
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:42.904
My God!

273
00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:45.656
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?


274
00:20:45.907 --> 00:20:47.241
It sure is.

275
00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:50.062
I've never seen anything
like this before.


276
00:20:51.703 --> 00:20:53.671
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?


277
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.304
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:55.506 --> 00:20:58.704
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.879
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.104
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:02.314 --> 00:21:05.409
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.


282
00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:08.788
This old place has had
an illustrious past.


283
00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:12.083
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...


284
00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:15.263
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.


285
00:21:15.464 --> 00:21:18.524
We had four presidents
who stayed here.


286
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.062
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:20.268 --> 00:21:21.827
Royalty?

288
00:21:22.205 --> 00:21:23.604
All the best people.

289
00:22:17.395 --> 00:22:19.980
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.


290
00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:24.277
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.


291
00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:27.405
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.


292
00:22:27.655 --> 00:22:29.574
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:32.620
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.415
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.005
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:47.537 --> 00:22:50.995
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.


297
00:22:51.209 --> 00:22:52.767
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:55.547 --> 00:22:56.605
Cozy.

299
00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:59.079
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:00.979
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:01.186 --> 00:23:03.849
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.


302
00:23:05.492 --> 00:23:07.983
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:08.528 --> 00:23:09.826
...homey.

304
00:23:12.734 --> 00:23:14.998
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:15.203 --> 00:23:19.504
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...


306
00:23:19.709 --> 00:23:22.007
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.


307
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.839
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...


308
00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:28.040
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.


309
00:23:29.453 --> 00:23:31.546
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:34.788
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:34.994 --> 00:23:36.962
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:37.162 --> 00:23:39.824
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.


313
00:23:40.032 --> 00:23:41.660
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:44.769
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.


315
00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:47.272
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:47.974 --> 00:23:50.000
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:54.106
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.


318
00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:56.877
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.


319
00:23:58.087 --> 00:24:01.454
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...


320
00:24:01.658 --> 00:24:04.787
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.


321
00:24:04.995 --> 00:24:06.962
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:07.163 --> 00:24:09.495
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.


323
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.667
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:15.501
I'll say!

325
00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:19.473
We can accommodate up to

326
00:24:20.012 --> 00:24:22.879
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.


327
00:24:23.082 --> 00:24:26.882
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.


328
00:24:27.086 --> 00:24:30.147
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.


329
00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:33.417
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.


330
00:24:33.628 --> 00:24:34.595
We don't drink.

331
00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:36.230
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:36.432 --> 00:24:40.664
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.


333
00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:42.997
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.


334
00:24:43.206 --> 00:24:45.936
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.


335
00:24:46.142 --> 00:24:47.336
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:47.544 --> 00:24:50.411
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.


337
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:54.346
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?


338
00:24:54.553 --> 00:24:56.418
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:56.622 --> 00:24:58.146
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:59.058 --> 00:25:01.754
I found him outside
looking for you.


341
00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:05.829
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?


342
00:25:07.234 --> 00:25:08.724
Come on over here.

343
00:25:08.936 --> 00:25:10.096
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:10.304 --> 00:25:14.298
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...


345
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.375
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:19.013
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.


347
00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:20.773
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:22.349
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.054
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.


350
00:25:28.258 --> 00:25:30.784
Now, are you a "Winnie",
or a "Freddie"?


351
00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:32.257
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:32.463 --> 00:25:35.660
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.


353
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:37.495
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:37.704 --> 00:25:39.296
This is it.

355
00:25:39.506 --> 00:25:42.441
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?


356
00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:45.472
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:45.713 --> 00:25:48.045
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.


358
00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:51.810
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.


359
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.586
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.281
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.


361
00:25:57.492 --> 00:25:59.687
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.


362
00:25:59.895 --> 00:26:02.126
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.


363
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.459
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.


364
00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:10.333
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.


365
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.635
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.


366
00:26:14.778 --> 00:26:17.839
This is where we keep
all of our meat.


367
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.041
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:20.252 --> 00:26:22.379
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:22.588 --> 00:26:25.649
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...


370
00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:28.953
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...


371
00:26:29.162 --> 00:26:32.132
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?


372
00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:35.733
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?


373
00:26:35.938 --> 00:26:37.803
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.532
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.


375
00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:42.473
Come along, now.
Watch your step.


376
00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.778
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:50.988 --> 00:26:55.015
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.


378
00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:56.626
I did?

379
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.558
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.


380
00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:02.029
But how did you know?

381
00:27:02.235 --> 00:27:04.761
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.


382
00:27:04.972 --> 00:27:07.236
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...


383
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.636
...calling him that
since we've been with you.


384
00:27:09.843 --> 00:27:12.039
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?


385
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.914
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:16.752 --> 00:27:18.948
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.521
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:22.726 --> 00:27:25.524
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.


389
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:28.164
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...


390
00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:32.166
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.


391
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.568
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...


392
00:27:35.774 --> 00:27:39.801
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.


393
00:27:40.046 --> 00:27:42.481
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.


394
00:27:42.683 --> 00:27:45.879
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:53.527 --> 00:27:55.995
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.392
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:00.603 --> 00:28:02.127
...and seven kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:02.338 --> 00:28:05.866
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...


399
00:28:06.076 --> 00:28:09.170
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:09.379 --> 00:28:13.680
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.


401
00:28:16.588 --> 00:28:18.215
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.


402
00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:21.986
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.


403
00:28:22.195 --> 00:28:24.129
I promise we won't
keep her very long.


404
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.528
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.


405
00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:29.600
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.438
I thought you did.

407
00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.699
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?


408
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:36.740
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.


409
00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:39.140
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?


410
00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:41.408
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.286
What kind of ice cream
do you like?


412
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.388
Chocolate.

413
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.560
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.


414
00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.124
It's amazing, all this
activity today.


415
00:28:57.335 --> 00:29:00.133
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...


416
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.773
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:05.035
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.


418
00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:09.273
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.


419
00:29:09.484 --> 00:29:11.543
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:17.226 --> 00:29:20.195
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?


421
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.171
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?


422
00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:39.640
I can remember when I was
a little boy...


423
00:29:40.053 --> 00:29:42.578
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...


424
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:46.623
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.


425
00:29:47.695 --> 00:29:49.993
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:54.228
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...


427
00:29:54.435 --> 00:29:57.064
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:57.672 --> 00:30:00.664
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.


429
00:30:01.344 --> 00:30:03.210
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03.413 --> 00:30:07.144
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.


431
00:30:11.823 --> 00:30:14.257
How long have you
been able to do it?


432
00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:21.865
Why don't you want
to talk about it?


433
00:30:27.108 --> 00:30:29.167
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:30.745 --> 00:30:33.270
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:38.117
Tony.

436
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:41.750
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:44.228 --> 00:30:47.629
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.


438
00:30:49.567 --> 00:30:51.592
Is Tony the one
that...


439
00:30:51.803 --> 00:30:53.361
...tells you things?

440
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.276
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:06.416
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.


442
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.717
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.


443
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.258
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?


444
00:31:19.568 --> 00:31:22.129
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:23.006 --> 00:31:25.941
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:31.446
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?


447
00:31:31.649 --> 00:31:34.209
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:39.047
I don't know.

449
00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:42.756
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:42.962 --> 00:31:43.987
Think.

451
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.831
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.400
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.711
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?


454
00:32:02.818 --> 00:32:05.048
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:05.522 --> 00:32:07.012
It's just that...

456
00:32:07.758 --> 00:32:10.591
...you know, some places
are like people.


457
00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.124
Some shine...

458
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.730
...and some don't.

459
00:32:15.968 --> 00:32:18.095
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...


460
00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:21.602
...has something about it
that's like shining.


461
00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:27.045
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.095
You know, Doc,
when something happens...


463
00:32:41.297 --> 00:32:44.926
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.


464
00:32:45.702 --> 00:32:47.261
Say, like...

465
00:32:47.472 --> 00:32:50.532
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:52.644 --> 00:32:57.309
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.


467
00:32:58.484 --> 00:33:01.921
Not things that anyone
can notice.


468
00:33:02.122 --> 00:33:06.923
But things that people
who shine can see.


469
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:11.329
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...


470
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.766
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.


471
00:33:19.308 --> 00:33:22.175
I think a lot of things
happened right here...


472
00:33:22.377 --> 00:33:26.075
...in this particular hotel
over the years.


473
00:33:26.617 --> 00:33:29.017
And not all of them
was good.


474
00:33:32.323 --> 00:33:34.952
What about room 237?

475
00:33:38.296 --> 00:33:40.491
Room 237?

476
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.895
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?


477
00:33:46.673 --> 00:33:48.140
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:49.644 --> 00:33:53.478
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:56.181
Nothing.

480
00:33:56.619 --> 00:33:59.850
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:34:00.055 --> 00:34:03.286
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.


482
00:34:03.492 --> 00:34:05.620
So stay out.

483
00:34:05.829 --> 00:34:08.320
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:47.714 --> 00:35:49.443
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51.452 --> 00:35:53.215
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:55.616
What time is it?

487
00:35:55.824 --> 00:35:57.689
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:01.188
Jesus.

489
00:36:02.132 --> 00:36:04.566
I guess we've been
staying up too late.


490
00:36:04.868 --> 00:36:06.301
I know it.

491
00:36:07.604 --> 00:36:10.472
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.


492
00:36:10.776 --> 00:36:12.334
Nice.

493
00:36:14.613 --> 00:36:16.410
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:19.847
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?


495
00:36:20.453 --> 00:36:24.788
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.


496
00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:27.887
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:30.557
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:30.765 --> 00:36:32.289
No good ones.

499
00:36:32.768 --> 00:36:35.236
Something will come.

500
00:36:35.738 --> 00:36:39.674
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.


501
00:36:41.244 --> 00:36:42.939
That's all it is.

502
00:36:45.048 --> 00:36:47.346
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?


503
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.185
I love it.

504
00:36:49.687 --> 00:36:51.278
I really do.

505
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.216
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.


506
00:36:55.426 --> 00:36:59.193
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.


507
00:36:59.398 --> 00:37:02.299
I tell you, when we first
came up here...


508
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.561
...I thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:05.004 --> 00:37:07.564
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.039
When I came up here
for my interview...


511
00:37:11.413 --> 00:37:15.247
...it was as though
I'd been here before.


512
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.078
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...


513
00:37:18.286 --> 00:37:20.482
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:21.224 --> 00:37:23.089
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:23.292 --> 00:37:27.024
...what was going to be
around every corner.


516
00:38:00.169 --> 00:38:03.366
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?


517
00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:06.134
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.


518
00:38:06.343 --> 00:38:09.471
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!


519
00:38:14.487 --> 00:38:15.613
Look out!

520
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.686
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.381
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:20.626 --> 00:38:22.254
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:23.263 --> 00:38:24.730
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:27.397
Let's take the rest
of this walking.


525
00:38:29.938 --> 00:38:31.337
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:33.976 --> 00:38:35.773
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:54.897
Dead end.

528
00:39:52.366 --> 00:39:53.993
We made it.

529
00:39:54.503 --> 00:39:55.732
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.262
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:23.837 --> 00:40:26.807
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?


532
00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:40.487
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...


533
00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:42.453
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:42.659 --> 00:40:46.527
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.


535
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.098
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.


536
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.031
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.


537
00:40:53.237 --> 00:40:56.035
They may have to
call off the search...


538
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.767
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.


539
00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:00.843
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...


540
00:41:01.047 --> 00:41:03.174
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.


541
00:41:03.382 --> 00:41:05.613
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...


542
00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:09.949
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.


543
00:41:10.157 --> 00:41:11.351
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11.558 --> 00:41:14.722
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.


545
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.803
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:49.809
How's it going?

547
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.540
Fine.

548
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.209
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.821
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.


550
00:44:12.035 --> 00:44:14.368
What do you want me
to do about it?


551
00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:18.668
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.036
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21.448 --> 00:44:22.779
I'm not...

554
00:44:23.149 --> 00:44:24.343
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.349
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:30.858 --> 00:44:33.258
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33.494 --> 00:44:36.089
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.


558
00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:38.766
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.


559
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.063
Wendy...

560
00:44:43.272 --> 00:44:45.867
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:46.777 --> 00:44:50.645
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.


562
00:44:50.848 --> 00:44:52.282
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:55.920
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.


564
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.554
Understand?

565
00:45:01.027 --> 00:45:02.187
Fine.

566
00:45:03.363 --> 00:45:05.092
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:05.298 --> 00:45:06.731
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:09.198
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:11.005 --> 00:45:13.940
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...


570
00:45:14.142 --> 00:45:16.441
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.


571
00:45:16.645 --> 00:45:18.875
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.345
Now, do you think
you can handle that?


573
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.116
Fine.

574
00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:31.459
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?


575
00:46:07.404 --> 00:46:08.769
All right, you!

576
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:12.005
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:14.112 --> 00:46:15.170
Missed!

578
00:46:20.752 --> 00:46:21.582
Don't have!

579
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.549
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:32.236 --> 00:47:33.533
I knew it.

581
00:48:03.805 --> 00:48:07.298
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:09.813 --> 00:48:13.510
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:13.717 --> 00:48:16.846
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.


584
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.349
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.


585
00:48:20.925 --> 00:48:23.724
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.


586
00:48:23.996 --> 00:48:25.327
We're just fine.

587
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.998
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.


588
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.228
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.


589
00:48:31.872 --> 00:48:35.672
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.


590
00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:39.174
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.


591
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:40.541
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:40.749 --> 00:48:44.185
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.


593
00:48:44.686 --> 00:48:48.088
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.


594
00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:51.459
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.


595
00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:55.227
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?


596
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.861
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:01.769
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.


598
00:49:01.974 --> 00:49:03.271
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:03.475 --> 00:49:07.673
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.


600
00:49:08.516 --> 00:49:10.006
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:10.217 --> 00:49:12.276
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:15.114
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.225
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:57.505 --> 00:49:59.939
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:04.813 --> 00:50:07.577
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:09.419 --> 00:50:11.285
Forever...

607
00:50:13.057 --> 00:50:14.820
...and ever...

608
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.785
...and ever.

609
00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:50.893
Tony...

610
00:50:51.903 --> 00:50:53.928
...I'm scared.

611
00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.972
Remember what Mr. 
Hallorann said.

612
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:08.486
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.


613
00:51:08.688 --> 00:51:10.849
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.350
Please let me give you
some money.


615
00:51:23.554 --> 00:51:25.579
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:25.823 --> 00:51:27.085
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:29.960
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30.597 --> 00:51:32.690
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.


619
00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:34.423
Would you like some?

620
00:51:36.169 --> 00:51:37.228
Sure.

621
00:51:37.438 --> 00:51:39.303
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:49.217 --> 00:51:51.845
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.


623
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.924
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.


624
00:51:59.696 --> 00:52:03.030
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?


625
00:52:04.469 --> 00:52:07.199
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.


626
00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:10.335
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:11.745 --> 00:52:13.645
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:15.542
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.


629
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.547
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:17.752 --> 00:52:20.880
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.


631
00:52:24.092 --> 00:52:25.389
All right.

632
00:52:25.594 --> 00:52:27.994
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:28.197 --> 00:52:29.687
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30.499 --> 00:52:32.229
Make sure you
come right back...


635
00:52:32.436 --> 00:52:34.427
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.


636
00:52:36.574 --> 00:52:38.064
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:27.332 --> 00:53:30.495
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?


638
00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.436
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:15.250
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:19.827 --> 00:54:21.625
Having a good time?

641
00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:25.166
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:29.299
Good.

643
00:54:31.507 --> 00:54:33.668
I want you to
have a good time.


644
00:54:34.377 --> 00:54:36.005
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46.459 --> 00:54:48.256
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.499
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:58.072 --> 00:55:00.632
Then why don't you
go to sleep?


648
00:55:04.212 --> 00:55:05.770
I can't.

649
00:55:07.249 --> 00:55:09.547
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:18.863 --> 00:55:21.127
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:27.139 --> 00:55:28.538
I do.

652
00:55:29.508 --> 00:55:30.840
I love it.

653
00:55:33.046 --> 00:55:34.377
Don't you?

654
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.240
I guess so.

655
00:55:40.889 --> 00:55:42.083
Good.

656
00:55:45.293 --> 00:55:47.626
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.002
I wish we could stay here
forever...


658
00:55:55.205 --> 00:55:57.002
...and ever...

659
00:55:57.675 --> 00:55:59.006
...and ever.

660
00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:05.474
What?

661
00:56:06.752 --> 00:56:09.847
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?


662
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.818
What do you mean?

663
00:56:21.937 --> 00:56:24.531
Did your mother ever
say that to you?


664
00:56:25.208 --> 00:56:27.005
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:27.777 --> 00:56:29.142
No, Dad.

666
00:56:31.314 --> 00:56:32.873
You sure?

667
00:56:33.417 --> 00:56:34.975
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.817
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:43.028 --> 00:56:45.622
I love you
more than anything else...


670
00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:48.391
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:49.169 --> 00:56:52.228
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...


672
00:56:52.538 --> 00:56:53.766
...never.

673
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.700
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:57.177 --> 00:56:58.735
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.772
Good.

676
00:58:28.718 --> 00:58:30.482
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49.746 --> 00:59:50.804
What happened?

678
00:59:51.014 --> 00:59:52.242
Honey...

679
00:59:53.116 --> 00:59:54.515
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02.694 --> 01:00:04.094
I had the most...

681
01:00:04.297 --> 01:00:06.891
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:11.771
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.


683
01:00:12.973 --> 01:00:14.338
Really.

684
01:00:18.612 --> 01:00:20.205
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:20.415 --> 01:00:22.849
...that I killed
you and Danny.


686
01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.818
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.889
I cut you up
into little pieces.


688
01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.088
My God.

689
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.360
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.267
Everything's going to be
all right.


691
01:00:46.378 --> 01:00:49.074
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.


692
01:00:56.923 --> 01:00:59.222
There. Now sit up.

693
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.157
It's okay.

694
01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:03.696
It's okay.

695
01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:08.964
Danny!

696
01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:11.206
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:14.571
Just go play in your room
for a while.


698
01:01:14.912 --> 01:01:16.971
Your dad's just got
a headache.


699
01:01:18.282 --> 01:01:21.309
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.


700
01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:26.223
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.


701
01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:27.949
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:29.863 --> 01:01:31.922
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38.539 --> 01:01:40.370
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41.576 --> 01:01:43.976
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:48.042
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:17.017 --> 01:02:18.985
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19.419 --> 01:02:20.852
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22.689 --> 01:02:24.749
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:24.959 --> 01:02:26.824
You did this to him!

710
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:28.462
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:29.798 --> 01:02:31.460
How could you?!

712
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.430
How could you?!

713
01:04:03.308 --> 01:04:06.402
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.


714
01:04:09.048 --> 01:04:11.949
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.643
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:31.129
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34.678 --> 01:04:37.079
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?


718
01:04:41.952 --> 01:04:44.217
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:47.758
What will it be?

720
01:04:49.429 --> 01:04:52.399
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...


721
01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:55.932
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...


722
01:04:56.136 --> 01:04:59.037
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.


723
01:04:59.239 --> 01:05:02.505
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.


724
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.042
So here's what:

725
01:05:05.347 --> 01:05:07.646
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:10.648
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:10.854 --> 01:05:12.879
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?


728
01:05:13.323 --> 01:05:15.690
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.751
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.


730
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:20.821
Good man.

731
01:05:21.132 --> 01:05:22.224
You set them up...

732
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.368
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.


733
01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:29.440
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.


734
01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.803
White man's burden.

735
01:05:37.885 --> 01:05:39.012
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.985
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:42.324 --> 01:05:44.758
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?


738
01:05:45.026 --> 01:05:47.393
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:48.097 --> 01:05:49.724
That's swell.

740
01:05:49.932 --> 01:05:51.627
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:51.835 --> 01:05:53.496
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53.704 --> 01:05:56.036
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.606
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:58.809 --> 01:06:01.744
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.


745
01:06:01.946 --> 01:06:04.176
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.


746
01:06:04.449 --> 01:06:06.246
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08.553 --> 01:06:13.082
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...


748
01:06:13.293 --> 01:06:17.354
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.


749
01:06:35.586 --> 01:06:38.054
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?


750
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.985
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43.495 --> 01:06:46.259
Things could be
a whole lot better.


752
01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:49.465
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52.473 --> 01:06:54.464
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:58.670
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.008
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.


756
01:07:02.217 --> 01:07:04.584
Nothing I can't handle,
though.


757
01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.482
Thanks.

758
01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:07.945
Women.

759
01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.681
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:11.723
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:16.490
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.168
Words of...

763
01:07:18.369 --> 01:07:19.894
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:34.648
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.


765
01:07:34.855 --> 01:07:36.483
I didn't.

766
01:07:38.527 --> 01:07:43.123
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.


767
01:07:43.732 --> 01:07:46.860
I love the little
son of a bitch.


768
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:51.304
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51.507 --> 01:07:54.305
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:58.382 --> 01:08:00.943
But that bitch!

771
01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:03.648
As long as I live...

772
01:08:03.922 --> 01:08:07.324
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.


773
01:08:16.938 --> 01:08:19.771
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.201
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:25.105
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.611
It could have happened
to anybody.


777
01:08:30.353 --> 01:08:33.811
And it was three goddamn
years ago!


778
01:08:34.023 --> 01:08:36.856
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.


779
01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.530
All I tried to
do was pull him up.

780
01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:47.000
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.


781
01:08:47.306 --> 01:08:48.534
I mean...

782
01:08:49.075 --> 01:08:52.602
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...


783
01:08:52.812 --> 01:08:55.646
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:11.768 --> 01:09:13.668
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:19.103
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.


786
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:21.836
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.


787
01:09:22.047 --> 01:09:24.608
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:27.153 --> 01:09:29.553
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:33.516
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33.726 --> 01:09:35.717
I swear it.
Danny told me.


791
01:09:36.063 --> 01:09:37.928
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.


792
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:41.591
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.


793
01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.135
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:47.842 --> 01:09:49.606
Which room was it?

795
01:09:57.255 --> 01:09:59.382
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.956
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...


797
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.359
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.


798
01:10:06.699 --> 01:10:09.133
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.


799
01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:12.463
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...


800
01:10:12.672 --> 01:10:14.799
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...


801
01:10:15.008 --> 01:10:18.136
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.


802
01:10:18.345 --> 01:10:22.339
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.


803
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.781
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.


804
01:10:24.986 --> 01:10:27.956
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.


805
01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:30.057
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.


806
01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.022
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.253
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...


808
01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:38.026
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.


809
01:10:38.236 --> 01:10:40.534
The governor of Colorado
is expected...


810
01:10:40.739 --> 01:10:42.468
...to declare
a weather emergency.


811
01:10:42.675 --> 01:10:44.506
The National Guard
might be called out...


812
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:45.904
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:46.112 --> 01:10:48.342
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...


814
01:10:48.547 --> 01:10:50.539
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...


815
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.379
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.


816
01:10:53.587 --> 01:10:56.579
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.


817
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:59.021
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.


818
01:10:59.228 --> 01:11:01.196
Local beaches should be jammed.

819
01:11:01.396 --> 01:11:03.421
Our weather expert, 
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03.632 --> 01:11:06.898
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.


821
01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:43.220
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.


822
01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:46.690
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.


823
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:05.783
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:05.987 --> 01:17:07.420
Thank God.

825
01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.858
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:14.064 --> 01:17:16.794
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.565
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:23.308 --> 01:17:26.800
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?


829
01:17:27.012 --> 01:17:28.571
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:29.049 --> 01:17:30.846
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:33.042
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:33.253 --> 01:17:34.515
How is he?

833
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.519
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:36.924 --> 01:17:38.050
Good.

835
01:17:43.865 --> 01:17:46.959
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.


836
01:17:51.442 --> 01:17:53.933
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:57.307
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57.514 --> 01:17:59.881
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:18:00.085 --> 01:18:02.747
The door was open,
the lights were on.


840
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:07.723
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:12.065 --> 01:18:15.092
What about those bruises
on his neck?


842
01:18:17.272 --> 01:18:19.604
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:27.883 --> 01:18:29.316
I think...

844
01:18:30.988 --> 01:18:33.548
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39.563 --> 01:18:40.791
No.

846
01:18:41.465 --> 01:18:43.490
That's not possible.

847
01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:52.471
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...


848
01:18:52.712 --> 01:18:55.307
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:55.783 --> 01:18:57.114
Is there?

850
01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:02.388
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...


851
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:05.957
...that he had before
we came up here.


852
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.389
Would it?

853
01:19:15.305 --> 01:19:18.298
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:23.145
...I think we...

855
01:19:23.348 --> 01:19:26.079
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:30.857 --> 01:19:32.689
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:36.864 --> 01:19:38.593
You mean...

858
01:19:39.633 --> 01:19:41.602
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.048
It is so...

860
01:19:52.249 --> 01:19:54.683
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...


861
01:19:54.885 --> 01:19:57.411
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!


862
01:19:57.622 --> 01:20:00.182
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:20:00.392 --> 01:20:04.352
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?


864
01:20:04.563 --> 01:20:08.294
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.


865
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.594
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.502
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...


867
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:18.338
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.


868
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:38.569
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.573
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:40.775 --> 01:21:43.209
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.


871
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.539
Good evening.
What can I do for you?


872
01:21:45.748 --> 01:21:49.309
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...


873
01:21:49.519 --> 01:21:52.818
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.


874
01:21:53.024 --> 01:21:56.619
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.


875
01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:59.490
I hate to put you through
any trouble...


876
01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:02.929
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.


877
01:22:03.135 --> 01:22:04.796
And with this storm
and everything...


878
01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:07.905
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...


879
01:22:08.107 --> 01:22:10.099
...just to see if
everything's okay.


880
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:11.907
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:12.112 --> 01:22:14.910
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?


882
01:22:15.116 --> 01:22:17.141
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.


883
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:18.784
All right, sir.

884
01:22:39.109 --> 01:22:41.078
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:41.279 --> 01:22:42.746
Good evening.

886
01:23:07.309 --> 01:23:08.776
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:08.978 --> 01:23:10.843
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:11.114 --> 01:23:12.843
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13.516 --> 01:23:14.505
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14.718 --> 01:23:17.380
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:18.022 --> 01:23:19.752
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20.559 --> 01:23:22.823
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:25.890
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26.733 --> 01:23:28.132
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.915
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.322
No charge?

897
01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:49.949
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55.599 --> 01:23:57.328
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00.539 --> 01:24:03.030
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:06.278 --> 01:24:08.269
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10.482 --> 01:24:15.011
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.


902
01:24:17.324 --> 01:24:20.259
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.


903
01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.396
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:27.202 --> 01:24:29.603
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:30.039 --> 01:24:32.030
Anything you say.

906
01:24:45.024 --> 01:24:47.492
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48.594 --> 01:24:50.061
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:50.262 --> 01:24:52.823
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.


909
01:24:54.067 --> 01:24:57.696
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.


910
01:24:57.905 --> 01:25:00.704
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.


911
01:25:00.909 --> 01:25:02.035
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:02.244 --> 01:25:04.405
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...


913
01:25:04.613 --> 01:25:06.808
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...


914
01:25:07.015 --> 01:25:09.541
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.


915
01:25:10.386 --> 01:25:13.685
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...


916
01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:14.879
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:18.255
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.


918
01:25:18.563 --> 01:25:20.963
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:21.399 --> 01:25:24.267
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...


920
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.734
...before the fish and
goose soiree.


921
01:25:26.939 --> 01:25:28.964
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:29.175 --> 01:25:30.506
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:33.575
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.


924
01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.578
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36.617 --> 01:25:40.247
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.


926
01:25:40.456 --> 01:25:41.718
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:41.924 --> 01:25:46.122
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.


928
01:25:46.695 --> 01:25:48.129
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:48.330 --> 01:25:49.730
Fine.

930
01:25:52.803 --> 01:25:54.463
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?


931
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:57.231
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:02.844
Grady?

933
01:26:03.048 --> 01:26:04.379
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:06.882
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:07.085 --> 01:26:08.609
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:18.764
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19.534 --> 01:26:21.627
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?


938
01:26:21.837 --> 01:26:24.533
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.412
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:38.355 --> 01:26:39.913
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41.427 --> 01:26:43.895
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?


942
01:26:44.096 --> 01:26:46.894
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:49.936 --> 01:26:53.269
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?


944
01:26:53.473 --> 01:26:54.303
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54.507 --> 01:26:57.773
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.


946
01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.337
And...

947
01:27:02.017 --> 01:27:03.279
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:07.547
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.


949
01:27:18.235 --> 01:27:20.636
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:22.108 --> 01:27:24.099
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25.478 --> 01:27:28.539
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.


952
01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.745
You...

953
01:27:31.218 --> 01:27:34.745
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.


954
01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:36.655
And...

955
01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:39.226
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:50.901
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:51.908 --> 01:27:54.638
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.


958
01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:00.181
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00.618 --> 01:28:03.951
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:11.764 --> 01:28:14.528
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:16.403 --> 01:28:18.132
But you...

962
01:28:18.872 --> 01:28:20.703
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:22.979 --> 01:28:25.880
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:28.784 --> 01:28:30.616
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:32.055 --> 01:28:34.649
I've always been here.

966
01:28:52.879 --> 01:28:55.075
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:55.316 --> 01:28:57.079
...that your son...

968
01:28:57.485 --> 01:29:00.181
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...


969
01:29:00.388 --> 01:29:02.584
...into this situation?

970
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.856
Did you know that?

971
01:29:13.103 --> 01:29:15.196
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17.542 --> 01:29:18.702
Who?

973
01:29:20.945 --> 01:29:22.572
A nigger.

974
01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:28.052
A nigger?

975
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:32.223
A nigger...

976
01:29:32.425 --> 01:29:33.518
...cook.

977
01:29:40.033 --> 01:29:41.296
How?

978
01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:45.334
Your son...

979
01:29:45.774 --> 01:29:48.573
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49.546 --> 01:29:53.038
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.


981
01:29:53.783 --> 01:29:57.015
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...


982
01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.189
...against your will.

983
01:30:07.733 --> 01:30:08.995
Well...

984
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:14.832
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:17.244 --> 01:30:19.645
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:22.749
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.282
A rather...

988
01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:26.010
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:26.222 --> 01:30:29.420
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:38.430
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:42.038
She...

992
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.232
...interferes.

993
01:30:47.347 --> 01:30:50.441
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.243
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52.686 --> 01:30:53.516
If...

996
01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.485
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.919
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.156
...a bit more.

999
01:31:04.366 --> 01:31:05.594
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.601
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.


1001
01:31:10.274 --> 01:31:14.177
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...


1002
01:31:14.379 --> 01:31:17.041
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:18.116 --> 01:31:19.777
But I...

1004
01:31:19.984 --> 01:31:21.951
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:23.288 --> 01:31:27.418
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...


1006
01:31:27.626 --> 01:31:28.888
...I...

1007
01:31:29.896 --> 01:31:31.989
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:46.248 --> 01:31:48.182
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51.588 --> 01:31:53.352
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53.557 --> 01:31:55.320
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55.526 --> 01:31:57.391
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:03.234
I could call
the forest rangers first...


1013
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:04.732
...and...

1014
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:06.935
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:07.306 --> 01:32:08.466
....so that...

1016
01:32:08.674 --> 01:32:12.771
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.


1017
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:18.712
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:24.921
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.


1019
01:32:25.127 --> 01:32:27.095
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28.465 --> 01:32:29.955
Redrum.

1021
01:32:30.934 --> 01:32:32.596
Redrum.

1022
01:32:43.849 --> 01:32:45.009
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:45.217 --> 01:32:46.115
Redrum!

1024
01:32:46.318 --> 01:32:48.378
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:54.328 --> 01:32:55.557
Hon?

1026
01:33:01.369 --> 01:33:05.272
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:10.279 --> 01:33:11.804
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:12.783 --> 01:33:14.216
Wake up.

1029
01:33:15.152 --> 01:33:17.416
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:18.822 --> 01:33:20.950
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:25.029 --> 01:33:28.898
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.176
Wake up!

1033
01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:42.681
Come on.

1034
01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:44.408
Right now.

1035
01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:46.251
Wake up!

1036
01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:54.321
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04.442 --> 01:34:07.310
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.


1038
01:34:07.513 --> 01:34:10.448
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:12.514
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15.723 --> 01:34:19.181
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19.527 --> 01:34:22.326
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:24.192
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:31.597
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.


1044
01:34:31.809 --> 01:34:34.369
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34.578 --> 01:34:36.341
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:12.789 --> 01:35:14.654
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:14.858 --> 01:35:17.089
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:20.389
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.


1049
01:35:21.632 --> 01:35:25.433
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.


1050
01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:29.232
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.


1051
01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.343
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.


1052
01:35:32.847 --> 01:35:34.974
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:35.182 --> 01:35:36.945
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:38.175
Bye.

1055
01:36:25.274 --> 01:36:28.301
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?


1056
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:30.672
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.472
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:37.323
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37.525 --> 01:37:38.651
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:39.827
Speaking.

1061
01:37:40.128 --> 01:37:42.619
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.


1062
01:37:42.897 --> 01:37:44.559
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:44.767 --> 01:37:46.132
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:46.335 --> 01:37:49.498
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.


1065
01:37:49.872 --> 01:37:51.464
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:55.344
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.


1067
01:37:55.546 --> 01:37:57.173
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:57.815 --> 01:38:00.683
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...


1069
01:38:00.886 --> 01:38:02.820
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.


1070
01:38:03.355 --> 01:38:06.051
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.


1071
01:38:06.258 --> 01:38:08.090
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:08.294 --> 01:38:10.387
What's the big deal
about getting there today...


1073
01:38:10.597 --> 01:38:12.155
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:13.033 --> 01:38:16.492
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...


1075
01:38:16.705 --> 01:38:18.935
...with the people taking care
of the place.


1076
01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:23.010
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.


1077
01:38:23.212 --> 01:38:25.009
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:25.214 --> 01:38:28.581
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.


1079
01:38:30.053 --> 01:38:32.079
How long will it take you
to get here?


1080
01:38:32.423 --> 01:38:34.084
About five hours.

1081
01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:36.521
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.


1082
01:38:37.027 --> 01:38:38.757
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:38.963 --> 01:38:41.796
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.


1084
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.560
That's all right. 
Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:50.309 --> 01:38:53.574
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.


1086
01:38:53.779 --> 01:38:56.340
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:59.917
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.


1088
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.611
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:01.823 --> 01:39:04.691
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...


1090
01:39:04.893 --> 01:39:08.192
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.


1091
01:39:08.397 --> 01:39:10.059
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:10.266 --> 01:39:13.463
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...


1093
01:39:13.670 --> 01:39:15.262
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15.472 --> 01:39:19.603
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.


1095
01:39:19.778 --> 01:39:22.645
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...


1096
01:39:22.848 --> 01:39:25.317
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...


1097
01:39:25.518 --> 01:39:28.316
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.


1098
01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.886
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:52.439
Hon?

1100
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.855
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?


1101
01:40:03.662 --> 01:40:07.360
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...


1102
01:40:07.567 --> 01:40:09.592
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:13.096
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.798
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:18.914 --> 01:40:20.382
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23.686 --> 01:40:26.552
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:36.526
All right.

1108
01:40:38.602 --> 01:40:41.503
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.


1109
01:40:42.307 --> 01:40:44.640
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.


1110
01:44:11.017 --> 01:44:12.712
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:19.326 --> 01:44:20.850
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:30.807 --> 01:44:33.469
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:37.849 --> 01:44:40.181
I just...

1114
01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:41.675
...wanted...

1115
01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.849
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:46.226 --> 01:44:47.488
Okay.

1117
01:44:48.094 --> 01:44:49.561
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:59.373 --> 01:45:01.365
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:09.286 --> 01:45:12.449
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:13.257 --> 01:45:15.384
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:16.194 --> 01:45:17.525
No...

1122
01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.295
...I can't.

1123
01:45:24.603 --> 01:45:27.868
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:30.243 --> 01:45:32.940
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36.584 --> 01:45:39.884
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42.690 --> 01:45:44.488
I think...

1127
01:45:44.893 --> 01:45:48.660
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.


1128
01:45:53.369 --> 01:45:55.964
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:00.945 --> 01:46:02.742
I don't know.

1130
01:46:03.248 --> 01:46:05.239
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:08.044
I think you have some
very definite ideas...


1132
01:46:08.254 --> 01:46:09.949
...about what should be done
with Danny.


1133
01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:12.751
And I'd like to know
what they are.


1134
01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.458
Well, l...

1135
01:46:16.763 --> 01:46:21.167
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.


1136
01:46:21.369 --> 01:46:24.668
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?


1137
01:46:26.909 --> 01:46:30.242
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?


1138
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.245
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:32.849 --> 01:46:35.182
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:37.855 --> 01:46:39.288
Please.

1141
01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:43.957
You believe his health
might be at stake.


1142
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:47.054
Yes.

1143
01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.030
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:55.837
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56.677 --> 01:46:57.838
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:58.046 --> 01:47:00.276
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00.482 --> 01:47:03.610
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?


1148
01:47:03.818 --> 01:47:05.309
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.354
Have you ever had
a single moment's...


1150
01:47:08.558 --> 01:47:10.617
...thought about
my responsibilities?


1151
01:47:10.827 --> 01:47:13.092
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...


1152
01:47:13.298 --> 01:47:16.096
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!


1153
01:47:16.367 --> 01:47:18.198
Has is ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:18.403 --> 01:47:21.896
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?


1155
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.166
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:24.376 --> 01:47:27.470
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...


1157
01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.809
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...


1158
01:47:31.018 --> 01:47:33.612
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?


1159
01:47:34.088 --> 01:47:36.113
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:36.324 --> 01:47:39.556
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!


1161
01:47:39.928 --> 01:47:43.021
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...


1162
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:45.631
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?


1163
01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:48.132
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!


1164
01:47:48.337 --> 01:47:49.861
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:51.798
Why?

1166
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:55.078
I just want to
go back to my room.

1167
01:47:55.279 --> 01:47:56.541
Why?

1168
01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:58.045
Well...

1169
01:47:59.183 --> 01:48:01.209
...I'm very confused.

1170
01:48:02.354 --> 01:48:06.017
And I just need a chance
to think things over.


1171
01:48:07.058 --> 01:48:10.995
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!


1172
01:48:11.198 --> 01:48:13.962
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?


1173
01:48:14.935 --> 01:48:16.426
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:18.068
Please!

1175
01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.898
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:20.108 --> 01:48:21.439
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21.642 --> 01:48:22.836
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:23.044 --> 01:48:23.909
Stay away!

1179
01:48:24.113 --> 01:48:25.102
Darling.

1180
01:48:25.314 --> 01:48:26.872
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:27.316 --> 01:48:28.647
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:30.842
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.


1183
01:48:31.055 --> 01:48:33.250
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."


1184
01:48:33.457 --> 01:48:36.221
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.


1185
01:48:36.494 --> 01:48:39.464
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.


1186
01:48:40.532 --> 01:48:42.090
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.625
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:43.835 --> 01:48:46.235
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46.505 --> 01:48:48.030
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:48.274 --> 01:48:49.332
Stay away!

1191
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:51.437
Please!

1192
01:48:52.479 --> 01:48:54.242
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54.449 --> 01:48:55.711
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56.484 --> 01:48:57.781
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:57.986 --> 01:48:59.476
Stop it!

1196
01:49:00.955 --> 01:49:02.081
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:03.417
Please!

1198
01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:05.854
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.


1199
01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.119
Stop it!

1200
01:49:07.363 --> 01:49:08.796
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:09.130 --> 01:49:10.759
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.


1202
01:49:10.967 --> 01:49:12.332
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12.537 --> 01:49:13.731
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:13.938 --> 01:49:15.166
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.807
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.


1206
01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:20.235
Goddamn--!

1207
01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:37.229
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:40.038 --> 01:50:41.505
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:42.908 --> 01:50:44.900
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:47.747 --> 01:50:48.975
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:04.355
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:06.735 --> 01:51:08.328
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08.572 --> 01:51:10.301
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11.608 --> 01:51:12.632
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:12.842 --> 01:51:16.404
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!


1216
01:51:20.117 --> 01:51:21.345
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:21.786 --> 01:51:24.722
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.


1218
01:51:24.923 --> 01:51:27.391
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.


1219
01:51:42.077 --> 01:51:43.442
Baby.

1220
01:51:44.646 --> 01:51:47.946
I think you hurt my head
real bad.


1221
01:51:49.552 --> 01:51:51.213
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.417
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:01.299 --> 01:52:02.494
Honey.

1224
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:07.502
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:16.117 --> 01:52:18.018
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:21.089 --> 01:52:22.920
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:23.125 --> 01:52:26.118
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...


1228
01:52:26.829 --> 01:52:29.195
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31.434 --> 01:52:33.266
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38.643 --> 01:52:40.509
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:47.953 --> 01:52:51.754
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.


1232
01:52:53.226 --> 01:52:55.820
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57.499 --> 01:53:01.629
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.


1234
01:53:06.242 --> 01:53:07.937
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:10.079 --> 01:53:12.275
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15.652 --> 01:53:17.586
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05.447 --> 01:55:07.847
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08.585 --> 01:55:10.553
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.713
Grady?

1240
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.912
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:42.386
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:44.326 --> 01:55:48.058
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...


1243
01:55:48.798 --> 01:55:51.289
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:58.009 --> 01:56:00.944
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:01.813 --> 01:56:05.875
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.


1246
01:56:06.753 --> 01:56:09.483
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:09.989 --> 01:56:11.821
I wonder.

1248
01:56:12.993 --> 01:56:15.086
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:16.297 --> 01:56:20.530
I, and others, have come
to believe...


1250
01:56:20.735 --> 01:56:23.727
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:24.373 --> 01:56:26.899
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:33.083 --> 01:56:37.384
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.


1253
01:56:38.222 --> 01:56:40.156
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:45.961
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.


1255
01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:47.632
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:47.833 --> 01:56:49.801
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:52.834
She seems to have got
the better of you.


1258
01:56:56.076 --> 01:56:58.739
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.641
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03.552 --> 01:57:07.717
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...


1261
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:11.654
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.


1262
01:57:12.228 --> 01:57:13.787
I fear...

1263
01:57:14.064 --> 01:57:16.624
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:20.104 --> 01:57:22.198
There's nothing
I look forward to...


1265
01:57:22.407 --> 01:57:26.309
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.


1266
01:57:27.713 --> 01:57:30.444
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?


1267
01:57:31.918 --> 01:57:33.943
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:48.632
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49.576 --> 01:58:52.136
Redrum.

1270
02:01:00.128 --> 02:01:01.686
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58.496 --> 02:01:59.963
I'm home.

1272
02:02:37.308 --> 02:02:40.175
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.


1273
02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:07.606
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:09.537
Run!

1275
02:03:10.379 --> 02:03:11.812
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:13.476
Run!

1277
02:03:13.684 --> 02:03:14.912
Quick!

1278
02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:21.150
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.


1279
02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:30.301
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?


1280
02:03:31.839 --> 02:03:33.898
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:34.108 --> 02:03:36.009
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:36.210 --> 02:03:38.270
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:53.198 --> 02:03:54.563
Please!

1284
02:03:55.300 --> 02:03:57.063
Don't!

1285
02:03:57.735 --> 02:03:59.260
Don't!

1286
02:04:17.859 --> 02:04:19.087
Stop it!

1287
02:04:23.332 --> 02:04:24.890
Here's Johnny!

1288
02:07:06.856 --> 02:07:08.084
Hello?

1289
02:07:13.530 --> 02:07:15.294
Anybody here?

1290
02:07:37.393 --> 02:07:38.951
Hello?

1291
02:07:51.273 --> 02:07:53.105
Anybody here?

1292
02:08:23.078 --> 02:08:25.013
Anybody here?

1293
02:09:06.029 --> 02:09:07.724
Danny-boy!

1294
02:11:48.585 --> 02:11:50.519
I'm coming!

1295
02:11:53.023 --> 02:11:54.958
I'm coming, Dan!

1296
02:12:55.763 --> 02:12:58.164
Great party, isn't it?

1297
02:13:15.819 --> 02:13:18.049
I'm coming!!

1298
02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:22.923
You can't get away!

1299
02:13:26.799 --> 02:13:29.291
I'm right behind you!

1300
02:17:27.679 --> 02:17:29.705
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!


1301
02:17:30.918 --> 02:17:32.647
Mommy.

1302
02:17:40.996 --> 02:17:42.395
Where...?
