2
00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.608
He loves that old camera.

3
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:26.692
Come on, Yang.

4
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:28.777
One second.

5
00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:31.404
Don't forget to join us.

6
00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:32.865
I will.

7
00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:34.783
Look here for a second.

8
00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:39.162
What are you doing? Come on.

9
00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:40.998
Come on, <i>gege.</i>

10
00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:01.393
<i>Yellow Equinox.
Is that a new blend?</i>


11
00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:02.728
<i>I think so.</i>

12
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.021
I'm sure I can make you
something close to it.


13
00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:05.272
Do you know
what kind of tea leaves?


14
00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:07.441
Oh, no. No, no.
It's not this kind of tea.


15
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.359
I'm looking for
your crystallized teas.


16
00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:12.655
Ah. Sorry, I...
I don't carry tea crystals.


17
00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:16.617
How can you be a tea shop
and not carry tea crystals?


18
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.285
How frustrating.

19
00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:20.078
Why don't you let me make you
something that might be close?


20
00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:23.040
No. No, no, no. This is...
I have to go.


21
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.375
Thanks for coming in.

22
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:38.514
<i>When's Daddy
coming home?</i>


23
00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:39.973
<i>Soon.</i>

24
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.686
He's always late.

25
00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:48.023
Well, I'm late sometimes, too.

26
00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:51.860
And, you know, I've got a busy
few weeks coming up, so...


27
00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.863
I know. Yang will be here.

28
00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.323
So will Daddy.

29
00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:58.158
Mika.

30
00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:03.456
Mika? Don't be
too hard on him.


31
00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:05.958
He told me there was
a rush of customers


32
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.501
towards the end of the day.

33
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:11.213
That's good news for Daddy.
He needed that.


34
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.187
<i>I loved that meal.</i>

35
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.231
Did you like
the gochujang sauce?


36
00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:31.191
- I did.
- I made it.


37
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:32.275
You mentioned that.

38
00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.861
It was her first time.

39
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.614
So you put the ingredients
in the bowl


40
00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:38.991
and you mixed them
all together?


41
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.660
Yeah.

42
00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:42.745
It's good, huh?

43
00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.831
It was really wonderful,
<i>mei mei.</i>


44
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:47.249
Thank you.

45
00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:50.878
Next time,
I'm gonna Juliet the carrots.


46
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.295
Julienne.

47
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.006
And no, you're not.

48
00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:11.356
Mika's growing up so fast.

49
00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:16.361
She keeps asking
why we're always busy.


50
00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:20.365
She understands.

51
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.993
- And Yang is...
- No, she doesn't.


52
00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:27.456
I feel like...

53
00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:30.918
I don't know. I...

54
00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.464
I don't want to regret.

55
00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.800
Um... Um,
I'll make more time.


56
00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.054
I will. I promise.

57
00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:45.641
You know I'm not putting this
on you, right?


58
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.477
Hmm. Sort of.

59
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.521
- I'm not.
- I'm teasing.


60
00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:55.901
I just want us to be a team.

61
00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:58.696
A family.

103
00:06:44.194 --> 00:06:46.655
It wasn't me. It was...

104
00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.741
It wasn't me! Mika?

105
00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:50.325
Not me! It was Daddy!

106
00:06:50.408 --> 00:06:51.409
Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.828
That's the furthest
we've ever gone.


108
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.538
That's true.

109
00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.707
Yang, we're... we're out.

110
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.166
Yang? Yang!

111
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.417
- <i>Yang!</i>
- <i>Yang?</i>


112
00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.313
It looks like
we have three years left


113
00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:22.024
on the warranty, but
they're not answering, so...


114
00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:24.026
- Can't you just go there?
- Yeah, I'm going to,


115
00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:25.569
but I don't know if the store
is even there anymore.


116
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.613
I did a search.
I can't find them anywhere.


117
00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:28.864
Did you call
Brothers & Sisters?


118
00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:30.365
We didn't buy
from them directly, so...


119
00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.742
They won't
honor the warranty?


120
00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:33.952
No, the warranty
is with Second Siblings.


121
00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:39.041
I told you we should've
just bought a new one.


122
00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:42.252
He was new.
I mean, practically.


123
00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:43.587
He's refurbished.

124
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:45.255
Certified refurbished.

125
00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:47.800
And he'd only been in use
for five days. Five days.


126
00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:48.884
- And we saved...
- But now he...


127
00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:52.638
Never mind.
Let's just get him fixed.


128
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:53.847
Yeah.

129
00:07:54.181 --> 00:07:55.516
You need to get Mika
to school.


130
00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.476
Mika, come on, we need to go!

131
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.565
Mika?

132
00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:11.198
- Mika?
- What happened to Yang?


133
00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.827
Oh, hi. Um...

134
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:16.954
I don't know.

135
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:19.039
He... He shut down last night.
Won't restart.


136
00:08:19.122 --> 00:08:20.916
- Has this happened before?
- No.


137
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:23.544
You got a technician?

138
00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:24.962
He's still under warranty.

139
00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:28.090
I wouldn't take him back
to Brothers & Sisters.


140
00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.883
They're just going to try
to get you to recycle him


141
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.969
for a new model. You know why.

142
00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:33.512
I'm not taking him there.

143
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.097
The warranty's
with another store.


144
00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:37.182
You didn't buy him direct?

145
00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.186
No. No, uh, he's certified.

146
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.063
I have to go and get Mika.

147
00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:44.732
Oh, Mika's still here?

148
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:45.899
Did she see Yang
all dead-eyed?


149
00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.610
- I bet it freaked her out.
- Yeah.


150
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.278
Listen, I got a technician
in Woodbury.


151
00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:51.614
It's worth the trek.

152
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.156
I'm going to send you
his info.


153
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.534
No, I'll just...
I'll take him to Quick Fix


154
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.702
if I can't figure it out.

155
00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:58.746
That place is for morons.
Don't take him there.


156
00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:00.706
My guy will fix him
for a third of the cost.


157
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.208
You tell Russ I sent ya.

158
00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:06.211
Okay. Okay, got to go.
Thank you.


159
00:09:06.294 --> 00:09:08.672
Mika? Mika?

160
00:09:10.257 --> 00:09:12.050
Come on, kiddo,
we gotta boogie.


161
00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:15.554
I don't want to go to school.
I want to be with Yang.


162
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.680
Mika, the longer we wait,

163
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.140
the worse it's gonna be
for Yang.


164
00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:20.267
What do you mean?

165
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.644
He'll start decomposing.

166
00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.062
What?

167
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.689
Come on, we gotta go.

168
00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:28.025
Mika, now.

169
00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:33.781
<i>FYI, Mika's going
to be with me for the day.</i>


170
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.991
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

171
00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:38.577
Well, you know,
she just refused and


172
00:09:39.202 --> 00:09:40.496
I wasn't gonna
drag her inside.


173
00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:41.705
<i>Mika?</i>

174
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.669
<i>Answer me.</i>

175
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.507
Mom, I can't.
I want to be with Yang.


176
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.591
<i>It's okay, darling.</i>

177
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.677
<i>I just wanted
to hear your voice.</i>


178
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.304
<i>You need to listen to Dad
and be good and calm, okay?</i>


179
00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:58.972
Is Yang
going to be better?


180
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.057
Yes, he's gonna be...

181
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.643
<i>Well, we don't
know for sure, but...</i>


182
00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:03.727
What do you mean?

183
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.895
Yeah, what do you mean?

184
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.524
<i>We can't make any
promises, but, Mika, listen,</i>


185
00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:11.318
<i>if you can be good and calm
for the rest of the day,</i>


186
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.070
<i>I'm gonna bring
you a surprise.</i>


187
00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:14.530
What?

188
00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:16.574
You just promised her
a surprise.


189
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:18.241
- What is it, Mom?
- <i>That's different.</i>


190
00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:19.409
Mom, what is it?

191
00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.869
<i>I wasn't trying to...</i>

192
00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:23.956
<i>I appreciate you
taking the day off.</i>


193
00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.541
- Mom?
- <i>Honey,</i>


194
00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.000
<i>be good and listen to Dad.</i>

195
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.126
<i>Oh, I need to go.</i>

196
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.128
<i>I have to get ready for
my presentation. We'll talk.</i>


197
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.423
What is she gonna
get me, Dad?


198
00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:37.010
I have no idea.

199
00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.429
I think I know.

200
00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.391
Just don't get your hopes up
for anything specific.


201
00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:48.313
<i>Gege,</i> I know
what she's gonna get me.


202
00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.069
Excuse me?

203
00:10:56.321 --> 00:10:58.699
- Excuse me?
- Can I help you?


204
00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:00.325
Yeah, I was wondering
if you could...


205
00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:01.785
I purchased a...

206
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.246
This used to be a store
where you could buy, uh,


207
00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:06.665
an older sibling
for Chinese adoptions.


208
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.166
It was called Second Siblings.

209
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.297
We sell fish and tanks.

210
00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:15.382
Yeah, I can see,

211
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.925
but do you know
what happened to that shop?


212
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.638
Before my store,
they sold memory.


213
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:24.558
Memory-balia. Is that how
you say it, memory-balia?


214
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:28.604
- Memorabilia.
- Memorabilia. Yeah, memories.


215
00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:30.355
But no technos?

216
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:35.068
No, I'm not sure
what it was before that.


217
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.154
All right, thank you.

218
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.532
Mika?

219
00:11:43.076 --> 00:11:45.328
Mika. Mika, come on, let's go.

220
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.542
I want a fish.

221
00:11:53.837 --> 00:11:56.674
<i>Gege?</i> Meet Puffy.

222
00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:02.387
Uh, it's a black box
issue, okay?


223
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.889
Uh, so by law,
we're not allowed


224
00:12:03.972 --> 00:12:06.600
to tamper with the, uh,
core interior, unfortunately.


225
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:07.851
So what is it
that you do here?


226
00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.102
Uh, well, we are certified

227
00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:10.896
with Brothers & Sisters,
Incorporated,


228
00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:13.816
to repair or replace
up to 12 parts


229
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.358
most commonly
in need of service.


230
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.944
If you want to take
a gander there


231
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.362
at the 12-point diagnostic.

232
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.073
Yeah, but your diagnostics
is just...


233
00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:24.076
Um, well, we hooked up Yang
to our certified analyzer,


234
00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:26.495
and, uh, all 12 parts
were in working order,


235
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.831
however, the readout
did indicate that there was


236
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.500
a core malfunction,
unfortunately, so...


237
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.919
So what?
So there's nothing you can do?


238
00:12:34.002 --> 00:12:35.629
Oh, there's a couple things
we can do here.


239
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.549
Um, we can have him recycled
at Brothers & Sisters.


240
00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:41.635
Uh, if you do so before
he begins to decompose,


241
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.555
you'll get $1,000 off on
a new model, which is great.


242
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:45.931
Uh, if you don't want
to have him recycled,


243
00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:48.225
which I completely understand,
um, we are equipped


244
00:12:48.308 --> 00:12:52.563
to turn his head and his voice
box into a virtual assistant,


245
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.815
and we'd salvage
the remaining parts for ya.


246
00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:56.108
What?

247
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:57.651
But we would have
to send the core to, uh,


248
00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:58.777
Brothers & Sisters.

249
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.153
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.


250
00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:01.864
Now, just give him back to me,
and I'll get a second opinion.


251
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:02.948
Oh, sure. Of course.

252
00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:05.367
Uh, so that'll be 250
for the diagnostics, please.


253
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.660
You're kidding me.

254
00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:09.497
Unfortunately, no.

255
00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:37.483
<i>That doesn't sound good.</i>

256
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.567
I know.

257
00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:41.779
<i>What did you tell Mika?</i>

258
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:44.114
I said we were getting
a second opinion.


259
00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:46.033
It's already taken longer
than I expected.


260
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:49.244
- Daddy?
- <i>Hi, Mika.</i>


261
00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:50.454
Hi.

262
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.747
<i>Are you okay?</i>

263
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.292
No. I got a fish.

264
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:56.794
<i>You did?</i>

265
00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.171
- <i>She did?</i>
- Yeah.


266
00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:01.924
Yeah, it's a little...
I'll explain later.


267
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.091
We're almost there.

268
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.762
<i>All right.
Keep me posted.</i>


269
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:07.930
Okay.

270
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.181
<i>Bye, Mika.</i>

271
00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:12.893
Bye. Say bye to Yang.

272
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.813
<i>Bye, Yang.</i>

273
00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:28.492
It is
an interior core problem.


274
00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:31.119
Yeah,
we knew that already.


275
00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:34.414
I need your permission
to break open the core.


276
00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:40.087
It's against the law.

277
00:14:42.422 --> 00:14:45.468
It's just... It's a bunch
of corporate bullshit.


278
00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:49.179
Do you know
who made that a law?


279
00:14:49.262 --> 00:14:51.139
Brothers & Sisters.

280
00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:54.226
They're just trying
to protect their spyware.


281
00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:56.436
You recycle that,

282
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.939
they will have so much data
on your family,


283
00:14:59.022 --> 00:15:00.483
it'll make your head spin.

284
00:15:01.316 --> 00:15:02.485
I'm not interested.

285
00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:04.903
Your loss.

286
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.239
You promised to fix him.

287
00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:08.532
Mika, I said wait outside.

288
00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.325
You said he was gonna be fine.

289
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.878
Come on, man.
You gotta make a decision.


290
00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:31.096
<i>Maybe
this is a good thing.</i>


291
00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:32.640
<i>How is this
a good thing?</i>


292
00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:36.309
Yang has been...

293
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.687
Yang has been wonderful.

294
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.483
And we'd
all miss him terribly,


295
00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:46.236
but we've been over-reliant
on him.


296
00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:50.533
We bought
Yang to connect Mika


297
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.118
to her Chinese heritage,
not to raise her.


298
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:54.828
Yeah, but we spent
a lot of money on Yang.


299
00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.121
I mean, I'm not gonna...

300
00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.207
...you know, feel bad
if he does more for Mika


301
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.627
than teach her
Chinese fun facts.


302
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.172
He does a lot more than that,
but you're missing the point.


303
00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.423
What's the point?

304
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:10.177
If we can't fix Yang,

305
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.304
we're not gonna buy
another sibling for Mika.


306
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.808
That would just be...

307
00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.185
strange.

308
00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:21.647
And we can't afford it anyway.

309
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.444
So we need
to be more involved.


310
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.861
More than we are now.

311
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.198
And not just in raising her,

312
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.618
in connecting Mika
to her culture and heritage.


313
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.078
Like, that will be on us.

314
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:40.874
So we need to be
ready and willing.


315
00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.119
Mei mei,<i>what's wrong?</i>

316
00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:00.454
<i>Nothing.</i>

317
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.582
Your face says
something different.


318
00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.045
Just some kids.

319
00:18:09.337 --> 00:18:10.714
In your class?

320
00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:13.717
No, kids at recess.

321
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.386
They were asking
about my real parents.


322
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:18.764
I see.

323
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.475
And what did you say?

324
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.399
I told them
about Mom and Dad,


325
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.986
and they said,
"No, your real parents."


326
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:38.075
They said Mom and Dad weren't
really my parents. Not really.


327
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.494
Do you believe them?

328
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:47.876
I mean,
they're our parents, but...


329
00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:50.713
we're not,

330
00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:54.842
you know, they're not...

331
00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:58.386
Not really.

332
00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.432
Mei mei.

333
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.437
Here it is.

334
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:10.023
Take a look at this.

335
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.527
Is the tree hurt?

336
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:17.781
No. Something wonderful
is happening here.


337
00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:18.866
What?

338
00:19:19.407 --> 00:19:22.786
You see, this branch
is from a different tree.


339
00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.080
It is?

340
00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:29.167
Yes, but now it's becoming
an actual part of this tree.


341
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.255
Not really, though.
It's just pretend.


342
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.340
Why do you say that?

343
00:19:35.423 --> 00:19:38.010
Because it's just
taped to the tree.


344
00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:43.181
Oh, right. It looks like that,
doesn't it?


345
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.770
Here, let's find one
that's already attached.


346
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.161
<i>Mei mei.</i>

347
00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:09.625
See this branch?

348
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:12.503
This branch
is also from another tree.


349
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.715
But look, you're connected
to Mom and Dad,


350
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.216
just like this branch.

351
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.012
You're a part of
the family tree. For real.


352
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.766
Then so are you.

353
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.269
Why do they do it?

354
00:20:29.352 --> 00:20:32.189
Why do they move branches
to different trees?


355
00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.607
It's called grafting.

356
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.526
They do it
to make something new.


357
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.694
Some of the apples you love

358
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.862
were produced
by combining different trees.


359
00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.072
It's an ancient technique

360
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.950
that was used in China
over 4,000 years ago.


361
00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.661
- A Chinese fun fact.
- Yes.


362
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.664
But you should know
that both trees are important.


363
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:53.043
Not just this one, but the one
from this branch, too.


364
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.922
Your other family tree is also
a vital part of who you are.


365
00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.257
Do you understand?

366
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.980
I want to go with Dad.

367
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.940
No, kiddo, you need
to go to school today.


368
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:19.027
But Yang!
I wanna see Yang!


369
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.738
Hey, what about your Pup
-Pup?

370
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.405
Don't you want
to show your friends?


371
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.491
Yang.

372
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.033
Yang's gonna be home soon.

373
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.744
Is he better?

374
00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:28.496
We'll see.

375
00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:31.957
But you need
to go to school.


376
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.209
Yang would want that.
Do it for <i>gege.</i>


377
00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.296
He'd want me
to show my Pup-Pup.


378
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.298
Mm-hmm.
- All right, I'm heading out.


379
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.009
Okay. Let me know how it goes.

380
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.093
Will do.

381
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.848
Your bag. Come on.

382
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.371
<i>We've always known
that some bots</i>


383
00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:55.415
<i>are equipped with spyware.</i>

384
00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:58.502
Especially the foreign ones.
And now we have proof.


385
00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.922
Now? So you've never
seen these before.


386
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.717
What does it matter?
It is what it is.


387
00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:09.429
Have you looked
at the recordings?


388
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.514
No.

389
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.225
No! I'm pro-privacy.

390
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.560
Can I see what's on here?

391
00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.270
You'll need a special reader.

392
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.898
The connectors, they're
nothing I've seen before.


393
00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:23.110
This is
some high-level shit, man.


394
00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.364
I mean, this is...

395
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.745
Sorry, I'm... I'm just trying
to wrap my head around it.


396
00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.709
- It's disturbing.
- Yes.


397
00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:42.838
It is disturbing.

398
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:47.425
It's time to wake up, man.

399
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:59.980
So how do I buy a reader
that I can see what's on this?


400
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.484
No one's selling
a reader for that.


401
00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:06.779
You'll have to have one

402
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.281
specifically modified
for those connectors.


403
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.283
Great.

404
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.088
Okay, I'm gonna
give you a name.


405
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:29.718
There's no number, but
this is where you find them.


406
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:47.778
How much do I owe you?

407
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.449
Like I said,
I get paid to fix things.


408
00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.035
Thank you.

409
00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.539
I guess I'll take Yang back.

410
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:02.668
I'll tell you what.

411
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:07.673
Why don't... Why don't you
look what's on there first?


412
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:13.428
If it's something bad,
disturbing,


413
00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:17.265
you might not want this bot
in your house anymore.


414
00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:25.398
You can take him, but also,
he's gonna start decomposing.


415
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.694
You won't get
as much value for him.


416
00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:32.865
I can keep him hooked up
on the simulator


417
00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.700
until you know more.

418
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.206
You're a friend
of George, right?


419
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.375
Yeah.

420
00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.754
<i>Sorry, she's in a meeting,</i>

421
00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:48.881
<i>but I'd be happy
to pass on a message.</i>


422
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.382
Yeah, could you
just tell her...


423
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:55.178
<i>Uh, hello?
Are you still there?</i>


424
00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:59.349
You know what, it's all right.
I'll talk to her later.


425
00:25:59.432 --> 00:26:01.059
<i>Great. Should I have
her call you back?</i>


426
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.978
No. No, it's all right.
Thank you.


427
00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:17.826
I was told
I could talk to you.


428
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.953
I was looking for Max Walker,
but they mentioned...


429
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:21.288
Oh, I'm not interested.

430
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:22.372
Sorry?

431
00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:25.000
Are you here to talk
some conspiracy shit?


432
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.628
No. No, Russ
told me that I could...


433
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.087
Russ? Oh, man,
you're one of them.


434
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.923
I can't believe
they let you back here.


435
00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:32.675
I'm not
one of them. I...


436
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:36.679
I have this.

437
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.015
I was told Max might be
able to help me with it.


438
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.517
What is that?

439
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.935
Russ said it's spyware.

440
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.566
Where did you find it?

441
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.027
It was inside Yang.

442
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.905
And... he's our...

443
00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:59.452
We bought him after we adopted
our daughter. She's Chinese.


444
00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:00.578
Mm-hmm.

445
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.871
And my neighbor
recommended Russ


446
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.623
after Yang shut down,
and Russ broke in...


447
00:27:04.707 --> 00:27:06.792
Can I... Sorry. Can I?

448
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.461
Yeah, sure.

449
00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:30.065
Holy shit, this isn't spyware.

450
00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:32.067
I'm pretty sure
it's a memory bank.


451
00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:37.030
<i>The memory banks
allowed the technos</i>


452
00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:39.617
<i>to record a few seconds
each day.</i>


453
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.744
<i>The labs were
trying to understand</i>


454
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.787
<i>what technos
considered memorable.</i>


455
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.914
<i>But the research
was uncovered,</i>


456
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:47.082
<i>the whole project
was shut down</i>


457
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:50.168
<i>immediately
for violating privacy laws.</i>


458
00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:51.587
<i>So what do I do?</i>

459
00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:57.009
Oh, I'm not gonna lie. This...

460
00:27:57.843 --> 00:27:59.762
This is a big deal.

461
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.348
If it's the regulator,
then Russ is right.


462
00:28:03.431 --> 00:28:05.308
He's not gonna turn on.

463
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.811
I'm just being
honest with you.


464
00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:12.065
But his existence,

465
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.569
Yang's existence would be

466
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:18.405
an invaluable contribution
to this museum


467
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:20.115
and just to
the whole understanding


468
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.659
of techno-sapiens.

469
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:28.248
So I guess
the real question's gonna be,


470
00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:31.585
what do we pay you to
have Yang and his memories


471
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:33.295
in our collection?

472
00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:38.759
Could I have
another one of these, please?


473
00:28:51.104 --> 00:28:52.105
Answer call.

474
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:54.733
- Hey.
- <i>Hey. How's Mika?</i>


475
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.068
She's next door.

476
00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.403
Next door? At George's?

477
00:28:58.487 --> 00:28:59.697
<i>Yep.</i>

478
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.781
Why?

479
00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:04.577
Because you're not here,
and I have work to do.


480
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:06.954
I'm taking care of Yang.

481
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.289
<i>Is that
what you're doing?</i>


482
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.373
Yes.

483
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:35.232
So you just
dropped her off over there?


484
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:37.901
No, his daughters
invited her over to play.


485
00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.405
You need to stop being
so hard on George.


486
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.951
He likes you,
and he's being really helpful.


487
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.119
His kids are clones.

488
00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.371
I don't want
to talk about this again.


489
00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:51.373
And he paints his face
for sporting events.


490
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:53.584
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with him?


491
00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:56.294
You need to stop. Okay?

492
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:06.930
How's the ramen?

493
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.268
It's, um, soothing.

494
00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:14.062
Yeah, I can see that.

495
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:17.608
What are you having?

496
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:20.486
Ramen.

497
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:23.363
Really? That's funny.

498
00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.407
<i>Is it?</i>

499
00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.493
Sort of, don't you think?

500
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.621
Are you any closer
to getting Yang fixed?


501
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:34.875
This is the third place
you've taken him to.


502
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.627
Well, he's actually
still at the repair shop.


503
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.922
I'm, uh, having
a part examined.


504
00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:41.715
By a specialist.

505
00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:44.301
So is he gonna be
up and running again soon?


506
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:49.515
I'm not sure. You know,
it's... it's complicated.


507
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:54.394
That's Mika. I got to go.

508
00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:03.111
Functions like
any other reader.


509
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:04.447
Should be intuitive.

510
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.531
Do I need a code?

511
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:08.534
Yeah, there should be
a certification card


512
00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:09.618
that came with Yang.

513
00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:11.954
There's a serial number
and a pin on it.


514
00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:13.581
Also, per our agreement,

515
00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:15.791
you'll need to bring
Yang's body here tomorrow.


516
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:16.875
- Sooner the better.
- Yes.


517
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:17.960
I wouldn't be surprised

518
00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:19.920
if Russ is trying
to replace parts


519
00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.964
and steal the originals.

520
00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:27.219
We will keep Yang's body
preserved here in a bio-state


521
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:30.931
while you go
and review the memories


522
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:32.975
and decide what
you want to do next.


523
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:35.644
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

524
00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:36.770
Thank you.

525
00:31:36.854 --> 00:31:39.648
I've dedicated my life to
understanding techno-sapiens.


526
00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:42.400
This... This is a gift.

527
00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.305
<i>I want to be</i>

528
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:14.933
<i>Just like the wind</i>

529
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:18.979
<i>Just flowing in the air</i>

530
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:22.900
<i>Flowing in open space</i>

531
00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:25.027
Yang taught you that?

532
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.071
Uh-huh.
It's his favorite song.


533
00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:29.865
Do you like it?

534
00:32:30.908 --> 00:32:31.950
I love it.

535
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:40.834
Hey.

536
00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:43.336
Mika's up late.

537
00:32:45.756 --> 00:32:46.965
She couldn't sleep.

538
00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:50.636
You going somewhere?

539
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.139
Brenda's meeting me
at the office.


540
00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:56.058
We're gonna
stay overnight and work.


541
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:58.477
We're behind.

542
00:32:59.562 --> 00:33:01.438
Sorry
I wasn't here earlier.


543
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:02.648
It's fine.

544
00:33:04.692 --> 00:33:06.610
You'll need to
take Mika to school


545
00:33:06.694 --> 00:33:07.820
and get her ready for the day.

546
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.655
Do you think you can do that?

547
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:10.989
Yeah, of course.

548
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.327
All right.
I need to go.


549
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.829
Are we...
Are we okay?


550
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.001
So what did the part reveal?

551
00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:25.546
The part?

552
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.841
The part.

553
00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:31.719
The specialist?

554
00:33:31.802 --> 00:33:34.054
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

555
00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:36.014
Um...

556
00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:40.352
You... We should
know something soon.


557
00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:45.816
I need to go.

558
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.945
Try and get
some sleep if you can.


559
00:34:03.459 --> 00:34:10.382
Serial 733951137CM99.

560
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:18.098
Pin 279321.

561
00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:28.210
Play.

562
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:35.175
<i>What are you doing?</i>

563
00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:40.473
Repeat.

564
00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:47.187
<i>What are you doing?</i>

565
00:36:01.577 --> 00:36:02.620
Play.

566
00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:34.777
Play.

567
00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:46.288
<i>I want to be loved...</i>

568
00:37:14.525 --> 00:37:20.238
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

569
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:22.032
- Five.
- Five.


570
00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:23.451
- Six.
- Six.


571
00:37:23.534 --> 00:37:24.827
- Seven.
- Seven.


572
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:29.498
Eight. Nine. Ten.

573
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.717
<i>Mei mei. Mei mei.</i>

574
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.897
Walk to me, <i>Mei mei.</i>
Walk to me.


575
00:37:55.566 --> 00:37:56.734
Careful.

576
00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:35.438
Wonderful.

577
00:38:39.192 --> 00:38:41.361
- <i>Cai hong.</i>
- <i>Cai hong.</i>


578
00:38:44.031 --> 00:38:45.407
They know
you didn't mean it.


579
00:38:57.545 --> 00:38:58.962
<i>Ni hao, Mei mei.</i>

580
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:17.565
<i>Daddy.</i>

581
00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:20.108
<i>Daddy.</i>

582
00:39:21.193 --> 00:39:22.360
Daddy!

583
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:25.155
Sorry,
is everything okay?


584
00:39:27.032 --> 00:39:28.534
I'm getting some water.

585
00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:30.410
Do you want me to?

586
00:39:30.494 --> 00:39:32.037
Are you watching a movie?

587
00:39:33.747 --> 00:39:34.748
I am.

588
00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:36.542
What are you watching?

589
00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:38.711
Just a...

590
00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:42.005
Just a documentary.

591
00:39:43.006 --> 00:39:44.550
Is it about tea?

592
00:39:48.178 --> 00:39:49.221
Yeah.

593
00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:54.935
Is it boring you to tears?

594
00:40:04.487 --> 00:40:05.613
Hey...

595
00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:10.117
Let's get you some water.

596
00:40:23.547 --> 00:40:24.548
I'll do it.

597
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:26.424
Okay.

598
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:38.186
Is this something you do?

599
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.606
Do you get yourself water
in the middle of the night?


600
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:46.028
<i>Gege</i> usually comes with me.

601
00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:50.115
Is that right?
So you'd wake him up?


602
00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:52.701
Does he sleep?

603
00:40:54.327 --> 00:40:55.663
No, I don't think so.

604
00:40:56.539 --> 00:40:59.207
I usually just say,
<i>"Gege."</i>


605
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.210
Not very loudly
because he can hear me


606
00:41:02.294 --> 00:41:04.046
even when I whisper.

607
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:08.551
I say, <i>"Gege,</i>
I want to get some water."


608
00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:10.343
Then he joins me
in the hallway,


609
00:41:10.427 --> 00:41:12.555
and we walk quietly
to the kitchen.


610
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.311
Why don't you just ask him
to get you a glass of water?


611
00:41:19.394 --> 00:41:20.813
Then you can stay in bed.

612
00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:24.024
I like getting my own water.

613
00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:38.997
<i>What do you mean
you want him back?</i>


614
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:40.082
<i>I mean I want him back.</i>

615
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:41.875
Did Max make the reader
for you?


616
00:41:41.959 --> 00:41:43.001
Max isn't there anymore.

617
00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:45.546
- Where is he?
- I don't know.


618
00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:48.381
I bet they took him.

619
00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:50.759
Ah!

620
00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:53.846
I can't believe
they finally got him.


621
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.601
Please, just let me
have Yang back.


622
00:41:59.142 --> 00:42:00.853
I want an explanation.

623
00:42:05.398 --> 00:42:07.735
Yang belongs to us. I...

624
00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:11.614
don't need to give you
an explanation.


625
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.797
It'll be all right.

626
00:42:33.636 --> 00:42:36.138
God,
I love cultural technos.


627
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:37.305
And since they're used

628
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:39.475
for adoptions
and language learning,


629
00:42:39.558 --> 00:42:42.019
they haven't had to
change much over the years.


630
00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:45.188
No need to be
faster or stronger.


631
00:42:46.899 --> 00:42:48.442
There's some damage here.

632
00:42:48.526 --> 00:42:50.778
Damn Russ just hacked
his way into the core.


633
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:52.655
There's a proper way
of opening it.


634
00:42:52.738 --> 00:42:53.739
So if you don't mind,

635
00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:55.533
we're just gonna do
a full check-up,


636
00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:57.993
and we're gonna restore Yang
as best we can.


637
00:42:58.536 --> 00:42:59.537
Oh, that would be great.

638
00:43:00.037 --> 00:43:02.665
It won't help
with his off state,


639
00:43:02.748 --> 00:43:05.292
but it should help
with his preservation.


640
00:43:33.946 --> 00:43:34.947
Play.

641
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:42.871
Repeat.

642
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:11.692
Play.

643
00:44:25.998 --> 00:44:27.332
<i>Come on, Yang.</i>

644
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:29.251
<i>One second.</i>

645
00:44:29.334 --> 00:44:30.961
My silly girl.

646
00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:34.465
Silly girl.

647
00:44:41.013 --> 00:44:42.347
He loves that old camera.

648
00:44:43.516 --> 00:44:44.517
Come on, Yang.

649
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:47.978
Silly girl.

650
00:44:48.979 --> 00:44:50.355
He loves that old camera.

651
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:51.649
Come on, Yang.

652
00:44:51.732 --> 00:44:52.733
One second.

653
00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:55.152
Don't forget to join us.

654
00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:56.278
<i>I will.</i>

655
00:44:58.238 --> 00:44:59.907
He loves
that old camera.


656
00:45:00.449 --> 00:45:01.492
Come on, Yang.

657
00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:03.786
One second.

658
00:45:04.578 --> 00:45:06.288
Don't forget to join us.

659
00:45:06.914 --> 00:45:07.915
I will.

660
00:45:07.998 --> 00:45:10.042
Silly girl.

661
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:11.835
Just look here
for one second.


662
00:45:26.642 --> 00:45:28.435
What are you doing?
Come on.


663
00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.228
Come on, <i>gege.</i>

664
00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:08.892
<i>What do you like</i>
about tea?


665
00:46:09.935 --> 00:46:11.394
Do you mean
the taste of tea?


666
00:46:11.854 --> 00:46:14.607
Maybe. Is the taste
why you like tea?


667
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:18.652
It has something
to do with it.


668
00:46:18.736 --> 00:46:20.613
Is it why you've
given your life to tea?


669
00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:23.365
Given my life to tea,

670
00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:26.243
well, that sounds
pretty serious.


671
00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:28.621
Is it not serious?

672
00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:33.416
I guess I've acquired
a taste for tea.


673
00:46:35.085 --> 00:46:37.129
But it's not why
I became interested.


674
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.008
Interested.

675
00:46:42.092 --> 00:46:43.218
I think what I was
really drawn to


676
00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:44.302
at the beginning was...

677
00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:45.387
I think what
I was really drawn to


678
00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:46.972
at the beginning
was the idea of tea.


679
00:46:47.055 --> 00:46:48.056
The idea of tea.

680
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.017
The idea of tea.

681
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.560
Yeah, I saw
this old documentary


682
00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:52.853
when I was in college.

683
00:46:52.936 --> 00:46:55.981
It was from the 20th century.

684
00:46:56.064 --> 00:46:57.441
And it was about this man

685
00:46:57.525 --> 00:46:58.776
<i>searching for the best tea
in China.</i>


686
00:46:58.859 --> 00:47:01.570
It's about a man searching
for the best tea in China.


687
00:47:01.654 --> 00:47:02.905
China is where tea started.

688
00:47:02.988 --> 00:47:03.989
Yes, I'm sure you have

689
00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:06.199
lots of interesting facts
about tea in China.


690
00:47:06.283 --> 00:47:07.284
I do.

691
00:47:07.367 --> 00:47:09.036
Would you like
to hear some of them?


692
00:47:10.412 --> 00:47:11.705
Maybe another time.

693
00:47:13.582 --> 00:47:15.000
I'm sorry, you were saying

694
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:17.461
about the man
searching for tea.


695
00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:18.754
Yeah. Yeah.

696
00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:21.549
Yeah, actually,
I think that's it.


697
00:47:21.632 --> 00:47:23.676
I think it was his searching
that compelled me.


698
00:47:24.927 --> 00:47:26.804
You know, the pursuit
of this illusive thing,


699
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:30.348
this process that was
connected to the soil,


700
00:47:30.432 --> 00:47:34.895
to the plants, to the weather,
and to a way of life.


701
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.439
To a way of life.

702
00:47:39.274 --> 00:47:41.193
So that's what
you like about tea?


703
00:47:42.736 --> 00:47:46.782
The search,
not so much the taste.


704
00:47:46.865 --> 00:47:48.366
No, no, no, the taste, too.

705
00:47:51.286 --> 00:47:54.707
There's this, uh...

706
00:47:56.459 --> 00:47:58.293
There's this part in the film,

707
00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:59.795
it's a great part,
where the man


708
00:47:59.878 --> 00:48:01.797
is explaining
to his German friend


709
00:48:02.715 --> 00:48:05.175
why it's so difficult for him
to describe the taste of tea.


710
00:48:05.258 --> 00:48:07.636
He says,
"There's no language for it.


711
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.097
"There are no words
to adequately express


712
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.182
"the mysterious nature
of tea."


713
00:48:13.308 --> 00:48:14.643
And his German friend,

714
00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:15.894
who's just standing
right beside him


715
00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:17.312
with a cup of tea, says,

716
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:20.398
"Yes, but I imagine things

717
00:48:20.483 --> 00:48:22.985
"like you are walking
through a forest,


718
00:48:23.068 --> 00:48:25.613
"and there are leaves
on the ground,


719
00:48:25.696 --> 00:48:28.907
"and it just had rained,
and the rain has stopped,


720
00:48:28.991 --> 00:48:32.035
"and it's damp, and you walk,

721
00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:36.248
"and somehow,
that is all in this tea."


722
00:48:38.542 --> 00:48:42.671
I mean, I loved that so much.

723
00:48:43.714 --> 00:48:46.634
I loved that so much.

724
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:49.386
"Somehow,
that is all in this tea."


725
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.054
<i>"Somehow,
that is all in this tea."</i>


726
00:48:51.138 --> 00:48:52.515
God, I watched it
over and over again.


727
00:48:52.598 --> 00:48:54.182
God, I watched it
over and over again.


728
00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:56.018
I would like to watch
this movie.


729
00:48:58.979 --> 00:49:00.355
Well, maybe
we can do it together.


730
00:49:02.357 --> 00:49:04.818
Yes. That would be nice.

731
00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:08.447
So do you believe it?

732
00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:09.865
What's that?

733
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.494
That a cup of tea
can contain a world?


734
00:49:13.577 --> 00:49:17.164
That you could taste
a place, a time?


735
00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:24.296
Let's put it
to the test, shall we?


736
00:49:49.488 --> 00:49:51.824
So you want to smell it first.

737
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.701
You know, there's not just

738
00:49:53.784 --> 00:49:57.538
flavor and the aroma,
there's history, too.


739
00:49:59.832 --> 00:50:00.958
You know, traditionally,

740
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:02.960
tea shops that were
family businesses


741
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:04.336
passed down
from one generation to an...


742
00:50:04.419 --> 00:50:05.420
<i>Were passed down from...</i>

743
00:50:05.504 --> 00:50:07.339
...generation to,
you know this,


744
00:50:07.422 --> 00:50:08.716
from generation to generation.

745
00:50:08.799 --> 00:50:10.718
Maybe it's time I started
teaching you the trade.


746
00:50:11.719 --> 00:50:14.054
Let's see if we can taste
the world together.


747
00:50:14.137 --> 00:50:15.305
Drink it all at once.

748
00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.159
What did you think?

749
00:50:40.623 --> 00:50:42.458
I'm not sure
if I can taste the forest.


750
00:50:46.336 --> 00:50:47.463
Do you taste anything?

751
00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:55.804
Maybe I haven't
the language for it.


752
00:50:57.347 --> 00:51:00.350
I wish Chinese tea wasn't
just about facts for me.


753
00:51:03.228 --> 00:51:04.229
What do you mean?

754
00:51:05.022 --> 00:51:07.232
I like watching
the way you make tea.


755
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:10.444
It's very beautiful.

756
00:51:12.362 --> 00:51:17.325
The way the leaves bloom
and float and fall.


757
00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:23.666
I wish I felt something
deeper about tea.


758
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.378
I wish I had a real memory
of tea in China.


759
00:51:30.964 --> 00:51:32.090
Of a place.

760
00:51:33.884 --> 00:51:35.177
Of a time.

761
00:51:37.054 --> 00:51:38.556
I think this would...

762
00:51:45.145 --> 00:51:46.146
What?

763
00:51:53.195 --> 00:51:55.989
Sorry. I lost
my train of thought.


764
00:52:06.083 --> 00:52:07.292
Are you happy, Yang?

765
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.130
<i>I don't know
if that's the question for me.</i>


766
00:52:13.006 --> 00:52:15.092
I don't know if that's
the question for me.


767
00:52:28.188 --> 00:52:29.189
Repeat.

768
00:53:13.567 --> 00:53:15.569
Play.

769
00:53:20.157 --> 00:53:26.163
<i>I want to be loved...</i>

770
00:53:26.246 --> 00:53:27.915
Repeat.

771
00:53:30.417 --> 00:53:31.835
Pause.

772
00:53:32.753 --> 00:53:33.754
Zoom in.

773
00:54:18.924 --> 00:54:20.008
Face match.

774
00:54:44.533 --> 00:54:45.909
What can I get you?

775
00:54:55.586 --> 00:55:00.423
<i>Our senses are stored,
never to be the same.</i>


776
00:55:00.508 --> 00:55:03.969
<i>Whisper to us. 
They existed.</i>

777
00:55:04.052 --> 00:55:06.555
<i>They existed. 
We can be...</i>

778
00:55:06.639 --> 00:55:07.931
What are you doing?

779
00:55:08.015 --> 00:55:11.560
<i>Be and be better,
for they existed.</i>


780
00:55:13.687 --> 00:55:14.980
Do you think
that's true?


781
00:55:16.398 --> 00:55:18.609
<i>Hello?</i>

782
00:55:37.836 --> 00:55:39.046
Hey, what can I get for you?

783
00:55:39.129 --> 00:55:40.631
Hey, do you know her?

784
00:55:41.298 --> 00:55:43.008
Uh, no, I don't.

785
00:55:43.091 --> 00:55:44.843
Could you ask someone else?
I think she used to work here.


786
00:55:44.927 --> 00:55:46.344
I'm sorry, there's a line.

787
00:55:46.428 --> 00:55:48.138
I'm gonna need you
to order something.


788
00:55:48.221 --> 00:55:50.307
Oh, I'll have
a double espresso.


789
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:52.059
And if I can speak to the
manager, that would be great.


790
00:55:52.142 --> 00:55:53.769
Double espresso, is that it?

791
00:55:53.852 --> 00:55:54.937
Yes. And the manager.

792
00:56:00.734 --> 00:56:02.319
Sorry, I can't help you.

793
00:56:02.945 --> 00:56:03.987
But she worked here.

794
00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:05.573
She doesn't work here anymore.

795
00:56:07.365 --> 00:56:08.576
But could you
tell me her name?


796
00:56:09.326 --> 00:56:10.619
Why do you want to find her?

797
00:56:13.205 --> 00:56:14.540
She knew my son.

798
00:56:15.415 --> 00:56:18.711
And he's not doing so well
right now. Health-wise.


799
00:56:19.628 --> 00:56:21.046
And I thought
she'd want to know.


800
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.298
But you've never met her.

801
00:56:23.716 --> 00:56:24.717
No.

802
00:56:25.258 --> 00:56:26.802
And you don't know her name.

803
00:56:28.136 --> 00:56:29.137
No.

804
00:56:30.347 --> 00:56:33.476
Yeah. Then I don't either.

805
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.561
Sorry.

806
00:56:46.071 --> 00:56:47.364
- Hey.
- Hey, George.


807
00:56:47.448 --> 00:56:48.449
What do you need?

808
00:56:48.532 --> 00:56:51.869
I was wondering if you'd ever
seen her around the house.


809
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.999
I... Who is she?

810
00:56:57.082 --> 00:56:59.084
I don't know,
but Yang knew her.


811
00:56:59.543 --> 00:57:00.878
Really? Huh.

812
00:57:01.545 --> 00:57:04.172
I... I didn't know
that bots, uh...


813
00:57:05.633 --> 00:57:08.927
That techno beings could
make friends on their own.


814
00:57:10.387 --> 00:57:12.222
- They were just...
- I... I don't know anything,


815
00:57:12.305 --> 00:57:14.349
I just want to find her.

816
00:57:14.432 --> 00:57:15.518
Hmm.

817
00:57:15.601 --> 00:57:17.310
Let me ask the girls.
Maybe they know something.


818
00:57:17.394 --> 00:57:18.687
Please. Thank you.

819
00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:21.148
Ladies, I need to see you.

820
00:57:22.483 --> 00:57:23.526
What is it?

821
00:57:24.276 --> 00:57:26.987
Just get over here.
And bring the twins.


822
00:57:28.822 --> 00:57:31.659
Vicky just made
the all-star softball team.


823
00:57:31.742 --> 00:57:34.244
You gotta come watch.
I mean, she's just great.


824
00:57:34.327 --> 00:57:35.454
Nice.

825
00:57:37.706 --> 00:57:38.707
What is it?

826
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:43.671
Mr. Fleming wants to know
if you've seen her around.


827
00:57:45.673 --> 00:57:46.799
Are you sure?

828
00:57:48.258 --> 00:57:49.552
Can we go?

829
00:57:50.052 --> 00:57:51.720
Yeah. Go ahead.

830
00:57:54.515 --> 00:57:55.516
How about you?

831
00:57:57.476 --> 00:57:58.561
Is she in trouble?

832
00:57:59.895 --> 00:58:02.397
- I don't...
- No. No, not at all.


833
00:58:02.856 --> 00:58:03.857
How's Yang?

834
00:58:04.775 --> 00:58:06.026
He's not so good.

835
00:58:06.944 --> 00:58:10.614
You know, I think finding her,
it might help.


836
00:58:12.157 --> 00:58:13.534
Yeah, I've seen her.

837
00:58:13.617 --> 00:58:14.618
You have?

838
00:58:14.993 --> 00:58:16.995
A couple times. 
At your place.

839
00:58:17.871 --> 00:58:19.039
Did you ever talk to her?

840
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.585
Once. Yang asked me
not to say anything.


841
00:58:22.668 --> 00:58:23.669
Why?

842
00:58:24.211 --> 00:58:25.671
You don't like clones, right?

843
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:29.382
- No, no, it's not...
- Come on, Vic. No fastballs.


844
00:58:29.467 --> 00:58:30.843
I just...
I've never had the...


845
00:58:30.926 --> 00:58:32.636
- It's... It's fine.
- No, it's not.


846
00:58:33.303 --> 00:58:34.304
Vicky.

847
00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:35.473
She's a clone.

848
00:58:36.223 --> 00:58:37.224
She is?

849
00:58:37.683 --> 00:58:42.020
Yeah, but she's really cool
and nice. Like most of us.


850
00:58:43.021 --> 00:58:44.022
I'm sure.

851
00:58:46.066 --> 00:58:47.485
Um, do you know her name?

852
00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:52.573
It's Aidy or Ada,
something like that.


853
00:58:53.907 --> 00:58:56.785
Okay. Thank you.

854
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:58.996
Look, I'm sorry
if I've ever...


855
00:58:59.079 --> 00:59:00.163
Can I go now?

856
00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:05.043
Yes. Thank you, sweetheart.

857
00:59:10.674 --> 00:59:11.925
I'm... I'm really sorry,
it's...


858
00:59:12.009 --> 00:59:13.719
No, no, no, it's... Honestly.

859
00:59:14.595 --> 00:59:15.804
You should see her fastball.

860
00:59:15.888 --> 00:59:18.891
I mean, she's just...

861
00:59:18.974 --> 00:59:21.184
...like, all day long.
I mean...


862
00:59:22.895 --> 00:59:24.855
Well, thanks, George.
I really have to...


863
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:27.357
- Another time.
- Yeah.


864
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:31.695
Uh, hey, maybe we can get a
drink together, huh? Sometime?


865
00:59:31.779 --> 00:59:34.406
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

866
00:59:50.464 --> 00:59:51.924
I want to see <i>gege.</i>

867
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:55.302
I know, love.

868
00:59:56.136 --> 01:00:00.641
You miss him. Me, too.
We just can't see him now.


869
01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:05.228
What about
the family dance?


870
01:00:05.854 --> 01:00:08.065
Are we never
gonna dance again?


871
01:00:08.148 --> 01:00:09.733
Of course we will.

872
01:00:10.943 --> 01:00:15.363
But we might have to compete
in the family of threes.


873
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.409
I don't want
to be a family of three!


874
01:00:19.493 --> 01:00:20.494
Mika.

875
01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:22.538
I want <i>gege</i> back!

876
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.960
Daddy's trying his best.
He's doing everything he can.


877
01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:30.337
I want him back, too.

878
01:00:33.966 --> 01:00:37.761
What about you, Mom?
Do you want him back?


879
01:00:40.097 --> 01:00:41.139
Of course I do.

880
01:00:50.566 --> 01:00:52.651
This is
dragging on too long.


881
01:00:54.695 --> 01:00:56.196
I just need
a little more time.


882
01:00:56.279 --> 01:00:59.199
Oh, we need
to start focusing on Mika.


883
01:00:59.825 --> 01:01:02.244
We're just making things
more difficult for her.


884
01:01:05.623 --> 01:01:09.502
Jake, do you hear me?

885
01:01:13.005 --> 01:01:14.965
If we can't get
Yang fixed, we just...


886
01:01:15.048 --> 01:01:17.468
we need to move forward. Okay?

887
01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:19.470
Now. Now.

888
01:01:20.888 --> 01:01:22.430
I need
to tell you something.


889
01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:44.119
<i>No, it's... it's frozen.</i>

890
01:01:44.202 --> 01:01:45.663
That's interesting.

891
01:01:45.746 --> 01:01:48.081
Try command
"memory reveal info,"


892
01:01:48.165 --> 01:01:49.750
and it should tell you
if it's corrupt or not.


893
01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:50.834
Okay, I'll do that.

894
01:01:50.918 --> 01:01:53.170
Also, I was wondering,

895
01:01:53.253 --> 01:01:57.007
is it possible for
cultural technos like Yang to


896
01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:00.135
want to have
romantic potential?


897
01:02:00.594 --> 01:02:02.262
Do you mean
for humans to use them?


898
01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:06.391
No, no, no, I mean, for Yang
to be interested in...


899
01:02:06.475 --> 01:02:09.645
There's a girl, and she
showed up in his memories,


900
01:02:09.728 --> 01:02:12.397
and, you know, we didn't know
anything about her.


901
01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:13.607
Really?

902
01:02:14.399 --> 01:02:15.609
That's fascinating,

903
01:02:15.693 --> 01:02:17.820
because I've never
heard of cultural technos


904
01:02:17.903 --> 01:02:21.114
having that capacity.
I cannot tell you how much...


905
01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:22.700
...Yang and his memories...

906
01:02:23.075 --> 01:02:24.535
I should get that.

907
01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:27.079
Oh, all right, okay.
But we'll touch base soon?


908
01:02:27.162 --> 01:02:29.122
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Great.


909
01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:36.505
You've been
looking for me?


910
01:02:37.465 --> 01:02:38.674
Yes.

911
01:02:39.717 --> 01:02:40.968
I'm Jake.

912
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.011
I know.

913
01:02:44.012 --> 01:02:45.097
I'm Ada.

914
01:02:45.806 --> 01:02:48.851
Ada. Well, come in, please.

915
01:02:49.935 --> 01:02:51.604
I knew something was wrong.

916
01:02:55.065 --> 01:02:57.735
We usually meet, and he wasn't
answering my messages.


917
01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:02.698
I'm sorry.

918
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.786
I'm sorry.

919
01:03:09.788 --> 01:03:12.290
I know Yang loves
being a part of this family.


920
01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:22.134
Can I ask how you met?

921
01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:25.178
At the coffee shop.

922
01:03:27.264 --> 01:03:28.348
He approached you?

923
01:03:31.018 --> 01:03:32.978
He was a regular customer.

924
01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:36.524
He used to buy things
all the time, which,


925
01:03:36.607 --> 01:03:39.026
you know, was funny when
I found out he was a techno.


926
01:03:41.403 --> 01:03:43.071
But, yeah,
we started talking, and...


927
01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:47.701
eventually, he asked me
if I wanted to do something.


928
01:03:49.953 --> 01:03:51.163
Were you and Yang...

929
01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:53.707
Were you guys...

930
01:04:03.926 --> 01:04:06.303
Well, we never really
talked about us in that way.


931
01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.739
Sorry, that's...
That's my wife. I need to...


932
01:04:27.032 --> 01:04:28.033
- Yeah.
- Sorry.


933
01:04:28.116 --> 01:04:30.578
Please... don't leave.

934
01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:38.210
She's freaking out.
You need to pick her up.


935
01:04:38.293 --> 01:04:39.336
What's she doing?

936
01:04:39.419 --> 01:04:40.588
They said she punched a kid,

937
01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:42.255
and then she started
screaming at everyone.


938
01:04:42.339 --> 01:04:44.633
- Holy shit.
- Are you able to get her now?


939
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.385
Yeah. Uh, yeah. 
I'm on my way.

940
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.137
Thank you.

941
01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:53.726
I want to see him.

942
01:04:59.314 --> 01:05:00.441
Mika...

943
01:05:03.026 --> 01:05:04.737
Yang loves you so much.

944
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:07.740
He always talks about you.

945
01:05:32.347 --> 01:05:34.349
- Thanks again for this.
- Oh, I understand.


946
01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:36.018
I'm sure everyone
misses him a lot.


947
01:05:40.063 --> 01:05:41.064
Mika.

948
01:05:47.613 --> 01:05:48.822
<i>Gege.</i>

949
01:05:53.285 --> 01:05:54.369
<i>Gege.</i>

950
01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:56.789
I'm sorry, baby.

951
01:05:58.165 --> 01:05:59.332
<i>Gege!</i>

952
01:06:47.548 --> 01:06:49.592
He would have his own area.

953
01:06:52.761 --> 01:06:58.476
We could put some
of his memories on a loop,


954
01:06:59.602 --> 01:07:00.978
projected,

955
01:07:01.729 --> 01:07:06.024
or on a set of readers
that visitors could wear.


956
01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:17.911
Of course, any memory would
have to be approved by you.


957
01:08:19.807 --> 01:08:20.891
Yang.

958
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:53.591
Play.

959
01:09:21.952 --> 01:09:23.537
<i>Your collection
is growing.</i>


960
01:09:24.246 --> 01:09:25.873
Oh, hi.

961
01:09:26.624 --> 01:09:28.000
Yes, it's getting bigger.

962
01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:31.211
Do you want me to stop now?
I can put some away.


963
01:09:31.294 --> 01:09:33.506
No, no. I'm not complaining.

964
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.216
I like them quite a bit.

965
01:09:36.759 --> 01:09:38.426
<i>Do you know
butterflies were one of</i>


966
01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:39.928
the favorite subjects
of Chinese trade art


967
01:09:40.012 --> 01:09:41.597
in the mid-1800s?

968
01:09:41.972 --> 01:09:43.599
No, I did not know that.

969
01:09:43.682 --> 01:09:46.018
The Chinese
love butterflies.


970
01:09:46.935 --> 01:09:49.062
There's also a famous
folk tale about two lovers


971
01:09:49.146 --> 01:09:52.024
who die of broken hearts
and reemerge as butterflies.


972
01:09:52.107 --> 01:09:55.653
Also, the ancient Chinese
philosopher Lao Tzu once said,


973
01:09:55.736 --> 01:09:57.946
"What the caterpillar
calls the end,


974
01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.574
"the rest of the world
calls a butterfly."


975
01:10:04.495 --> 01:10:05.496
I like that.

976
01:10:06.789 --> 01:10:09.124
I like that.

977
01:10:14.296 --> 01:10:15.714
Is this something you believe?

978
01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:18.801
- Hmm?
- That the end...


979
01:10:18.884 --> 01:10:21.970
That the end
is also a beginning?


980
01:10:22.054 --> 01:10:23.221
...is also

981
01:10:24.097 --> 01:10:25.223
the beginning?

982
01:10:28.977 --> 01:10:29.978
For the caterpillar...

983
01:10:30.062 --> 01:10:32.481
For the caterpillar, yes.

984
01:10:34.483 --> 01:10:36.944
But do you believe
it's true for all things?


985
01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:41.532
I don't know.

986
01:10:41.615 --> 01:10:45.453
I'm not programmed
to believe in that way.


987
01:10:45.536 --> 01:10:47.162
What about you?

988
01:10:51.959 --> 01:10:54.002
I'd like to believe that.

989
01:10:54.086 --> 01:10:56.046
Do you?

990
01:10:56.547 --> 01:10:57.631
Do you?

991
01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:03.136
Sometimes I think

992
01:11:04.763 --> 01:11:05.764
humans are programmed

993
01:11:05.848 --> 01:11:08.350
to believe
in such things, but...


994
01:11:12.395 --> 01:11:14.982
I don't know if it's really
in our best interest.


995
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.070
May I be honest with you?

996
01:11:21.321 --> 01:11:23.616
Yes. Wait, is...

997
01:11:24.825 --> 01:11:26.744
Is not being honest
an option for you?


998
01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.787
I don't think so.

999
01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:32.875
Hmm.

1000
01:11:36.044 --> 01:11:37.170
Go on.

1001
01:11:42.384 --> 01:11:47.931
I'm fine if there's
nothing in the end.


1002
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.687
Are you?

1003
01:11:56.148 --> 01:11:58.567
Maybe I was programmed
this way as well.


1004
01:12:10.871 --> 01:12:12.831
Does it ever
make you feel sad?


1005
01:12:21.674 --> 01:12:22.675
Um...

1006
01:12:23.676 --> 01:12:27.095
There's no something
without nothing.


1007
01:12:38.106 --> 01:12:40.818
Does it ever
make you feel sad?


1008
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.823
There's no something
without nothing.


1009
01:12:47.575 --> 01:12:48.617
Lao Tzu?

1010
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.369
I'm not sure.

1011
01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:17.646
Did Yang ever struggle
with being a techno?


1012
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.694
What do you mean?

1013
01:13:25.153 --> 01:13:29.324
I mean, did he ever...
want to be human?


1014
01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:35.623
What?

1015
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.542
Nothing.

1016
01:13:42.755 --> 01:13:44.214
It's just...

1017
01:13:44.297 --> 01:13:46.634
That's such a human thing
to ask, isn't it?


1018
01:13:47.801 --> 01:13:49.219
We always assume
that other beings


1019
01:13:49.302 --> 01:13:50.345
would want to be human.

1020
01:13:50.428 --> 01:13:52.014
What's so great
about being human?


1021
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.936
So he never struggled with it?
He never... Questioned it?


1022
01:14:01.774 --> 01:14:02.858
Not to me.

1023
01:14:06.194 --> 01:14:07.195
I see.

1024
01:14:15.328 --> 01:14:17.330
He did question
if he was Chinese.


1025
01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:20.417
He did?

1026
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.921
Yeah.

1027
01:14:28.926 --> 01:14:31.512
What makes someone Asian?

1028
01:14:34.807 --> 01:14:36.266
He'd ask that all the time.

1029
01:14:38.811 --> 01:14:40.771
Maybe he just wanted
to help Mika understand


1030
01:14:40.854 --> 01:14:42.481
what it means to be Chinese.

1031
01:14:46.359 --> 01:14:48.612
He was dedicated
to his little sister.


1032
01:14:54.201 --> 01:14:55.828
Yeah, Yang was a good brother.

1033
01:14:58.997 --> 01:15:00.833
He's a great brother.

1034
01:16:49.191 --> 01:16:50.734

1047
01:18:05.433 --> 01:18:06.434
Hello.

1048
01:18:06.519 --> 01:18:08.562
Hi, uh,
could I speak to the owners?


1049
01:18:08.646 --> 01:18:10.147
Uh, yes. One moment.

1050
01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:17.488
<i>He wasn't just quiet.</i>

1051
01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:20.533
<i>He seemed despondent. Broken.</i>

1052
01:18:20.616 --> 01:18:22.284
We took him back
a few days later,


1053
01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:24.286
and they let us
make an exchange.


1054
01:18:24.369 --> 01:18:25.538
Brothers & Sisters?

1055
01:18:25.621 --> 01:18:27.330
No, it was, uh...

1056
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.669
Well, I can't remember
the name.


1057
01:18:31.752 --> 01:18:33.253
We didn't buy him new.

1058
01:18:34.838 --> 01:18:35.839
You didn't?

1059
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:38.300
No, but he was certified.

1060
01:18:39.384 --> 01:18:40.553
Second Siblings.

1061
01:18:41.386 --> 01:18:43.346
Maybe. Is that in Chinatown?

1062
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:44.598
Yeah, it used to be.

1063
01:18:46.016 --> 01:18:49.603
I assume he was on when you
bought him in a sleep state?


1064
01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:51.772
That sounds right.

1065
01:18:58.487 --> 01:18:59.530
Extract

1066
01:19:01.406 --> 01:19:02.783
alpha.

<i>There is
not enough space.</i>


1068
01:19:04.785 --> 01:19:07.455
<i>Would you like to compress
beta or gamma?</i>


1069
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:09.247
Compress beta.

1070
01:19:09.623 --> 01:19:10.916
<i>Beta compressed.</i>

1071
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:14.962

1073
01:19:17.172 --> 01:19:19.216
<i>Would you like
to compress gamma?</i>


1074
01:19:19.675 --> 01:19:20.926
Compress gamma.

1075
01:19:21.009 --> 01:19:22.636
<i>Gamma is compressing.</i>

1076
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.059
<i>Gamma compressed.</i>

1077
01:19:41.404 --> 01:19:42.490
Extract alpha.

1078
01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:10.893
<i>Di-di.</i>

1079
01:20:25.574 --> 01:20:26.992
<i>Ni hao, di-di!</i>

1080
01:20:37.169 --> 01:20:38.587
<i>Di-di,</i> wake up.

1081
01:20:40.047 --> 01:20:41.339
<i>Di-di.</i>

1082
01:20:45.177 --> 01:20:47.095
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

1083
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.773
We're going to miss you.

1084
01:21:23.048 --> 01:21:25.718
<i>Hi, we're here
to help Emma Davidson.</i>


1085
01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:28.345
<i>Yes, come in.</i>

1086
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.351
Slowly bring it down.

1087
01:21:35.268 --> 01:21:36.562
Side to side.

1088
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.064
Good.

1089
01:21:43.902 --> 01:21:46.154
Your niece
is going to like me.


1090
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:51.994
Hey. Let's go get Yang.
Come here. Go get him.


1091
01:21:52.077 --> 01:21:54.079
You better not.

1092
01:22:01.587 --> 01:22:02.921
Can I tell you something?

1093
01:22:17.478 --> 01:22:18.562
Come on!

1094
01:23:27.881 --> 01:23:29.467
<i>She was my great aunt.</i>

1095
01:23:30.634 --> 01:23:31.635
<i>Your original?</i>

1096
01:23:32.928 --> 01:23:34.221
<i>So Yang knew her?</i>

1097
01:23:35.138 --> 01:23:36.139
<i>Yes.</i>

1098
01:23:37.516 --> 01:23:39.267
He never told you?

1099
01:23:42.563 --> 01:23:43.564
No.

1100
01:23:46.734 --> 01:23:49.027
But I always helped.

1101
01:23:54.366 --> 01:23:56.034
Sorry.

1102
01:24:09.214 --> 01:24:12.760
I wish he would have
told me about her. Us.


1103
01:24:13.969 --> 01:24:14.970
Do you?

1104
01:24:39.453 --> 01:24:40.538
He found you.

1105
01:25:46.353 --> 01:25:47.480
She's asleep.

1106
01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:25.100
I don't want Yang to be
on display in the museum.


1107
01:26:26.977 --> 01:26:28.061
Neither do I.

1108
01:26:29.312 --> 01:26:30.481
But...

1109
01:26:32.315 --> 01:26:34.192
We should let them study
his memories.


1110
01:26:37.613 --> 01:26:40.407
- Do you think so?
- Yes, his existence mattered.


1111
01:26:42.117 --> 01:26:43.285
And not just to us.

1112
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:51.126
Yeah.

1113
01:28:30.225 --> 01:28:31.434
<i>Gege.</i>

1114
01:28:58.128 --> 01:28:59.129
Daddy.

1115
01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:01.590
Hey, what are you doing up?

1116
01:29:02.633 --> 01:29:03.967
What are you doing?

1117
01:29:06.219 --> 01:29:07.220
You want some water?

1118
01:29:09.389 --> 01:29:10.599
Want to sit beside me?

1119
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:24.029
Can't sleep.

1120
01:29:25.448 --> 01:29:26.449
Me neither.

1121
01:29:28.909 --> 01:29:30.869
Don't want to say bye to <i>gege.</i>

1122
01:29:32.329 --> 01:29:33.330
Me neither.

1123
01:29:39.503 --> 01:29:42.756
<i>I want to be</i>

1124
01:29:45.718 --> 01:29:48.929
<i>I want to be</i>

1125
01:29:51.181 --> 01:29:56.019
<i>I want to be
just like a melody</i>


1126
01:29:56.770 --> 01:30:00.315
<i>Just like a simple sound</i>

1127
