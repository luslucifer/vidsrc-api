1
00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:07.589
Oh, you Rio Grande!

2
00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:09.634
Get in there.

3
00:03:09.797 --> 00:03:12.595
V¡va Méx¡co!

4
00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:26.514
V¡va Méx¡co!

5
00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:29.987
This here's Mexican
dirt. You can't touch me.


6
00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:36.746
Thought you'd get me?

7
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:41.433
You're a disgrace to the Confederacy.

8
00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:50.949
Speed, this ain't no time
to let me down. Get up!


9
00:04:02.637 --> 00:04:04.229
This is Mexican territory.

10
00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:24.193
He gets across the river
and his horse faints on him!


11
00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:40.394
This ain't fair, goddamn
it. This ain't fair.


12
00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:45.752
This ain't fair.

13
00:04:56.357 --> 00:05:00.635
Good Lord. They're
stringing up old Speed.


14
00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:06.236
I have here a very fine animal

15
00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:10.026
once owned by the hombre
we're about to hang.


16
00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:11.755
What am I offered?

17
00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:15.466
Hey! I still own that horse.

18
00:05:16.397 --> 00:05:21.790
When we want to hear from you,
amigo, we'll rattle your cage.


19
00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:24.596
Ain't that the horse that fainted?

20
00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.829
Yeah, he fainted. But
he got up, didn't he?


21
00:05:34.557 --> 00:05:36.275
What?

22
00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:41.109
What?

23
00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:52.435
Towfield, I said keep
these buzzards out.


24
00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:58.035
Take it easy, Moon. You're lucky
you're getting a decent hanging.


25
00:05:58.197 --> 00:06:01.473
I'd have done it out
there on a scrub oak.


26
00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:06.916
Goddamn vultures hanging
around here all morning.


27
00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:10.626
They just want to see
the man of the hour.


28
00:06:10.797 --> 00:06:13.106
Well, I'm flattered as hell.

29
00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:21.475
You're a real card,
Moon. I'm gonna miss you.


30
00:06:24.877 --> 00:06:28.313
Your family's here. 
Make it short.

31
00:06:32.797 --> 00:06:34.389
Boys!

32
00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:37.674
Brother Abe, Jimmy,

33
00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:40.226
Gussy and everybody.

34
00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:47.150
Dumb-ass deputy. He thought
you were really my family.


35
00:06:47.677 --> 00:06:50.145
So I figured...

36
00:06:52.517 --> 00:06:56.112
You look pretty as a painting, honey.

37
00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:04.111
- How ya doin', Henry?
- Well...


38
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.146
...roll it out.

39
00:07:09.357 --> 00:07:14.954
- Nothing like that, Henry.
- We just come to see you off.


40
00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:18.229
See me off?

41
00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:23.075
Doesn't look like you did
too good on your own, Henry.


42
00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:28.675
You should've stuck with us.
We was going places, goddamn it.


43
00:07:31.037 --> 00:07:34.029
What do you mean, "was"?

44
00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:36.870
All you gotta do is spring me.

45
00:07:38.797 --> 00:07:41.630
If we tried anything,
we'd only get shot.


46
00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:44.470
Yeah, but that's without my plan.

47
00:07:45.477 --> 00:07:47.627
Cut that out.

48
00:07:56.797 --> 00:08:00.836
Big Abe, they're gonna
send me to the bone orchard.


49
00:08:03.997 --> 00:08:09.276
If you got anything you want to
give away, Henry, now's the time.


50
00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:12.873
Say your goodbyes, boys.

51
00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:25.116
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah, Coogan, sure.


52
00:08:31.037 --> 00:08:36.191
It just ain't right. Just for cutting
a few horses and robbing a few banks.


53
00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:39.633
The law's gotta be changed, Henry.

54
00:08:39.797 --> 00:08:41.355
Go on outside.

55
00:08:43.677 --> 00:08:45.588
So long, Moon.

56
00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:50.153
Adios.

57
00:08:55.957 --> 00:09:01.315
Well, honey, at least we had
some good old times together.


58
00:09:03.597 --> 00:09:06.270
You was the best I ever had.

59
00:09:07.437 --> 00:09:10.190
Except maybe that circus fella.

60
00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:17.114
- Why does that always upset you?
- Why bring that up now, Hermine?


61
00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.472
- Shit!
- Oh, Henry.


62
00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:22.556
Don't worry, Moon.

63
00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:27.108
I'm gonna take care of this
girl like she's my very own.


64
00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:30.553
- Come on, honey.
- Oh, Henry.


65
00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:51.874
Mr Moon?

66
00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:56.149
It's about that time.

67
00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:01.707
- What about my last meal?
- You're smoking it.


68
00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:05.275
Hands behind your back, Mr Moon.

69
00:10:16.317 --> 00:10:17.670
He ain't for you.

70
00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:22.592
I wouldn't take you to a dog fight
if you was the defending champ.


71
00:10:29.557 --> 00:10:32.629
You oughtn't to have
done that, Mr Moon.


72
00:10:32.797 --> 00:10:37.188
Well, why don't you
keep me in jail for it?


73
00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:40.315
- You tell him about the ordinance?
- No.


74
00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:42.754
Why not?

75
00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:46.671
People I don't like,
I don't tell nothing.


76
00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:50.386
- Goddamn it, Towfield.
- What ordinance?


77
00:10:59.757 --> 00:11:04.353
- What ordinance, Sheriff Pile?
- Kyle.


78
00:11:04.517 --> 00:11:08.271
We got this ordinance here,
passed after the Civil War,


79
00:11:08.437 --> 00:11:11.429
because a lot of our
boys didn't come home


80
00:11:11.597 --> 00:11:14.907
and the women was
chewing up the grass.


81
00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:19.992
- I feel sorry for the grass.
- I feel sorry for the women.


82
00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:23.706
This ordinance says any
man, short of a murderer,


83
00:11:23.877 --> 00:11:28.268
can be saved from the gallows
by any property-holding female,


84
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.827
providing she decides to marry him.

85
00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:36.354
They done that in Roman
times, as I recall.


86
00:11:36.877 --> 00:11:42.076
Sweet Jesus H Christ
Almighty! Ma'am! Ma'am!


87
00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:47.595
There's a couple of things about
me that I'd like you to consider.


88
00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:51.113
- I don't need your insults.
- I agree completely.


89
00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:54.906
But you've gotta take into
consideration that a man...


90
00:11:55.077 --> 00:11:57.193
...can get a little irritated...

91
00:11:57.557 --> 00:12:01.106
...and act like the dickens
when he's about to die.


92
00:12:01.277 --> 00:12:04.952
- Buzzards, huh?
- Well, buzzards can fly.


93
00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:08.109
And they keep the
desert clean. I cook.


94
00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:11.314
I cook like a sonofabitch.

95
00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:14.071
I mean like the dickens.

96
00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:20.111
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.


97
00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:21.790
I understand.

98
00:12:28.117 --> 00:12:30.073
Henry Lloyd Moon,

99
00:12:30.237 --> 00:12:35.789
you've been found guilty of horse
thievery and sentenced to be hanged.


100
00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:39.548
Do you have any final last words?

101
00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:45.750
Just this:

102
00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:48.954
I wanna tell you good
people of Longhorn,


103
00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:53.794
especially you lovely ladies,

104
00:12:53.957 --> 00:13:00.192
that the old saying, "You can't
judge a book by its cover",


105
00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:03.394
it's true.

106
00:13:03.557 --> 00:13:08.995
Some books are all
scruffed up on the outside,


107
00:13:09.157 --> 00:13:12.308
but when you turn around
and look inside, why,


108
00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:17.187
the words is just wonderful.

109
00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:21.912
Is that it, Moon?

110
00:13:22.837 --> 00:13:26.989
Isn't there anybody
else got anything to say?


111
00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:34.306
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.


112
00:13:35.557 --> 00:13:39.436
"He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.


113
00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:42.828
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.


114
00:13:42.997 --> 00:13:45.306
"He restoreth my soul. "

115
00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:47.236
That's not right.

116
00:13:47.397 --> 00:13:50.469
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.


117
00:13:51.037 --> 00:13:54.666
"He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.


118
00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:56.395
"He restoreth my soul.

119
00:13:56.797 --> 00:13:59.470
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.


120
00:13:59.637 --> 00:14:03.186
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley... "


121
00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:07.191
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War.

122
00:14:07.357 --> 00:14:12.875
The only reason why I turned to
crime was there wasn't no jobs.


123
00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:17.349
Not one single job for a
man who risked his life...


124
00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:20.907
...for his country.

125
00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:22.749
In the Confederacy!

126
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.030
This one's dumb, he'll swing for sure.

127
00:14:27.197 --> 00:14:28.516
He's better off.

128
00:14:28.677 --> 00:14:32.636
"And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever. "


129
00:14:32.797 --> 00:14:35.186
Bullshit!

130
00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:40.713
Ready to go.

131
00:14:47.037 --> 00:14:48.436
Stop!

132
00:14:49.757 --> 00:14:51.554
I'll take him.

133
00:14:55.197 --> 00:14:58.553
Florence! Now...

134
00:14:59.477 --> 00:15:02.549
Don't you think that you're...

135
00:15:02.717 --> 00:15:06.835
...a mite too elderly to take
on a responsibility like this?


136
00:15:07.477 --> 00:15:11.834
I've got a good feeling
about him, Andrew.


137
00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:15.956
The boy's a veteran. He
deserves a second chance.


138
00:15:17.237 --> 00:15:20.912
Somebody take this
son-bitchin' blindfold off me


139
00:15:21.077 --> 00:15:23.637
and let me see my bride.

140
00:15:27.397 --> 00:15:29.035
Where is she?

141
00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:34.235
Florence!

142
00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:37.787
Florence!

143
00:15:43.837 --> 00:15:46.909
Mrs Henry Moon.

144
00:15:47.077 --> 00:15:49.750
Let me look at you.

145
00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:57.832
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence!


146
00:15:57.997 --> 00:16:00.113
Stand back, please.

147
00:16:06.997 --> 00:16:08.828
Just ain't your day.

148
00:16:08.997 --> 00:16:10.874
Maybe she just fainted.

149
00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:14.666
- I made her dizzy.
- Down she go, up you go.


150
00:16:16.997 --> 00:16:19.033
Is she dead?

151
00:16:25.877 --> 00:16:27.947
Then I'll take him.

152
00:16:34.557 --> 00:16:38.470
Julia, what are you
saying? He's an outlaw.


153
00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:42.628
I assumed that's why
you're hanging him.


154
00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:48.355
Are you drunk?

155
00:16:49.437 --> 00:16:51.667
Sheriff, you know I don't drink.

156
00:16:51.837 --> 00:16:53.589
'Course she don't drink.

157
00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:58.830
You want him?

158
00:17:00.717 --> 00:17:03.106
The law says I can claim him, right?

159
00:17:03.957 --> 00:17:09.077
I asked you out ten times. What did
I get? A flap of your umbrella. Shit!


160
00:17:13.877 --> 00:17:15.913
All right.

161
00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.033
OK, Julia.

162
00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:22.548
Mr Moon, what do you say?

163
00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:29.113
I ain't no side of beef
to be auctioned off, but...


164
00:17:29.277 --> 00:17:31.233
...hell, fine by me.

165
00:17:33.757 --> 00:17:37.352
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.

166
00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:40.907
I ain't taking Frank
Towfield's business tonight.


167
00:17:41.077 --> 00:17:45.309
Somebody's taking his business,
or we ain't got no business.


168
00:18:21.597 --> 00:18:25.033
Now, Mr Moon: no
drinking, no gambling,


169
00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:29.270
no wife-beating, no
alley-cattin' and what have you.


170
00:18:29.717 --> 00:18:31.548
You've got to mind her.

171
00:18:31.717 --> 00:18:35.187
If you try running, there'll
be $500 on your head.


172
00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:41.071
Well, gentlemen, much
obliged to you. Much obliged.


173
00:18:44.837 --> 00:18:47.067
Shall I take the reins, dear?

174
00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:52.236
Adios!

175
00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:59.990
See, I told you he had a plan.

176
00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:11.077
You can dance in the air, you
sonofabitch. Stealing my girl.


177
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:20.988
Miss, in case you want to
know who you're dealing with...


178
00:19:24.597 --> 00:19:28.146
...I used to ride with
Quantrill's Raiders.


179
00:19:32.397 --> 00:19:34.433
You always this quiet?

180
00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:40.032
When I have something
to say, you'll hear it.


181
00:19:40.997 --> 00:19:45.991
Well, look, I can get off right
here as far as I'm concerned.


182
00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:49.945
Of course, a good
husband's hard to find.


183
00:19:52.077 --> 00:19:58.073
You weren't hard to find, standing
there with a rope around your neck.


184
00:20:01.037 --> 00:20:05.508
Yeah. You sure are a smart woman.

185
00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:08.475
I like smart women.

186
00:20:08.637 --> 00:20:11.310
Sure you do.

187
00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:36.516
Who's that?

188
00:20:36.677 --> 00:20:39.987
One of the reasons we got married.

189
00:21:06.317 --> 00:21:07.636
Hey, Rover.

190
00:21:07.797 --> 00:21:09.708
That's Grover.

191
00:21:35.117 --> 00:21:37.187
This is where I live.

192
00:21:39.957 --> 00:21:44.508
Well, Julia. It ain't
much, but it's a start.


193
00:21:51.757 --> 00:21:56.387
Guess I don't get to carry
you across the threshold.


194
00:21:57.117 --> 00:21:59.551
Wipe your feet, please.

195
00:22:02.277 --> 00:22:04.393
Always do.

196
00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:25.069
Well... it looks like the opera house.

197
00:22:28.237 --> 00:22:32.276
Please take your clothes off, Mr Moon.

198
00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:57.788
Don't sit there.

199
00:23:00.317 --> 00:23:03.514
Here, put these on.

200
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:09.676
These is work clothes.

201
00:23:10.317 --> 00:23:11.830
That's right.

202
00:23:13.397 --> 00:23:16.309
But I just got married.

203
00:23:16.477 --> 00:23:19.708
Don't count on that too much.

204
00:23:40.477 --> 00:23:44.356
This is a gold mine? In Texas?

205
00:23:44.517 --> 00:23:46.473
It's gonna be.

206
00:23:48.117 --> 00:23:52.076
Looks like mice bit into it.

207
00:24:05.397 --> 00:24:08.753
First you'll begin crevassing,

208
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:13.115
then cross-cut using the
singular jacking method.


209
00:24:13.277 --> 00:24:16.826
I ain't familiar with
that particular method.


210
00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:22.111
You pry away any loose rocks.

211
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:26.589
Are you watching?

212
00:24:28.437 --> 00:24:32.112
Then you insert the drill.

213
00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:34.827
Like this.

214
00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:38.148
Then you use the sledgehammer.

215
00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:42.749
Simple.

216
00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:52.035
Where's the gloves?

217
00:24:53.197 --> 00:24:55.153
My hands blister easy.

218
00:24:55.717 --> 00:24:57.992
Better blisters than neck burns.

219
00:25:01.757 --> 00:25:03.475
Mr Moon...

220
00:25:03.637 --> 00:25:07.835
Pretend we're friends
and call me Henry.


221
00:25:07.997 --> 00:25:13.833
The railroad is breathing down my
neck, so let's not waste any more time.


222
00:25:14.397 --> 00:25:17.867
I'll do all I can do, but...

223
00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:20.232
...that's all I can do.

224
00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:27.465
I'll be outside running
auriferous tests.


225
00:25:35.077 --> 00:25:39.787
Why don't you run one on
your skull while you're at it?


226
00:26:06.757 --> 00:26:09.225
Supper's ready.

227
00:26:26.077 --> 00:26:29.228
I don't believe in
wasting time at the table.


228
00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:36.151
How'd you come into this place?

229
00:26:37.717 --> 00:26:40.550
It was my father's.

230
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:44.153
Did he believe in this gold mine?

231
00:26:45.277 --> 00:26:48.269
He believed, but not enough.

232
00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:53.069
Sounds like he was the
brains in the family.


233
00:27:01.997 --> 00:27:04.352
Boiled chicken?

234
00:27:05.797 --> 00:27:08.152
Boiled is better for you.

235
00:27:49.917 --> 00:27:52.147
How's about a little dessert?

236
00:28:06.717 --> 00:28:11.233
I said, how's about a little dessert?

237
00:28:11.717 --> 00:28:18.065
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer me the first time.


238
00:28:20.517 --> 00:28:24.396
Can I ask you a personal question?

239
00:28:28.397 --> 00:28:32.276
When was the last
time you had a man?

240
00:28:32.437 --> 00:28:37.033
I hope you don't mind confined
spaces, tomorrow we start tunnelling.


241
00:28:37.197 --> 00:28:40.587
Goddamn, I should've known.

242
00:28:40.757 --> 00:28:45.547
You can always tell a virgin because
the whites of the eyes ain't clear.


243
00:28:47.237 --> 00:28:50.229
I got this theory on
virgins, that they...


244
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:54.913
...always look peaked and grouchy
because they're going against nature.


245
00:28:55.077 --> 00:28:59.355
I don't want to get calluses
patting myself on the back, but...


246
00:28:59.517 --> 00:29:03.908
...in my time I have put a
gal or two in tune with nature.


247
00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:08.593
I'm sure nature is very grateful.

248
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:12.154
Listen to me.

249
00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:16.913
Don't let starting
late bother you none.


250
00:29:17.077 --> 00:29:19.750
Some of them late bloomers is...

251
00:29:27.597 --> 00:29:33.593
I'll be outside in the barn if
you feel like getting acquainted,


252
00:29:33.757 --> 00:29:36.555
or talking about tunnelling.

253
00:29:41.797 --> 00:29:47.474
And remember, nature
is the great provider.


254
00:30:06.117 --> 00:30:07.436
Goddamn.

255
00:30:09.197 --> 00:30:11.631
Well, good morning, Spot.

256
00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:16.107
Could use some bacon...

257
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:21.633
Morning, miss. 
What's for breakfast?

258
00:30:29.557 --> 00:30:33.835
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.


259
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:40.150
Don't you worry about me,
I know how to pace myself.


260
00:30:44.597 --> 00:30:46.235
If I want to...

261
00:30:48.077 --> 00:30:51.956
...I can do this all day long.

262
00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:59.867
I'm talking about all day long.

263
00:31:02.477 --> 00:31:04.752
Pace myself.

264
00:31:04.917 --> 00:31:06.475
Where are you going?

265
00:31:11.037 --> 00:31:13.107
I wanna...

266
00:31:14.717 --> 00:31:18.266
...take a little Spanish pause.

267
00:31:18.437 --> 00:31:21.668
That's one of the keys
to pacing yourself.


268
00:31:22.717 --> 00:31:26.835
You just go on trimming your wicks.

269
00:31:28.477 --> 00:31:31.628
I can do this all day long.

270
00:31:35.157 --> 00:31:39.355
I'm talking about all day long.

271
00:31:41.957 --> 00:31:44.312
All day long.

272
00:31:56.117 --> 00:31:59.792
Hey, lady!

273
00:32:02.517 --> 00:32:04.473
Understand?

274
00:32:07.957 --> 00:32:12.667
She sure is full of piss
and vinegar today, ain't she?


275
00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:37.437
A lot of literature on Philadelphia.

276
00:32:37.597 --> 00:32:41.636
What's the fascination with
the city of motherly love?


277
00:32:41.797 --> 00:32:44.391
Brotherly.

278
00:32:45.117 --> 00:32:47.347
I'm moving there.

279
00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:52.955
- To Philadelphia?
- Just as soon as I strike gold.


280
00:32:55.477 --> 00:32:58.549
I like it down there in Mexico.

281
00:32:58.717 --> 00:33:00.787
Pace suits me better.

282
00:33:00.957 --> 00:33:04.233
Slow days and fast nights.

283
00:33:20.477 --> 00:33:22.433
What a pleasant surprise.

284
00:33:22.597 --> 00:33:25.555
We saw lights and felt
we weren't intruding.


285
00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:28.754
Oh, Laurette, you're never intruding.

286
00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:45.312
You all remember my husband, Henry.

287
00:33:46.957 --> 00:33:50.188
Welcome to our humble abode.

288
00:33:50.357 --> 00:33:52.996
We brought a little wedding something.

289
00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:55.034
Oh, you shouldn't have.

290
00:33:56.237 --> 00:33:58.068
How pretty.

291
00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:03.230
We was just saying how
much we needed a figurine.


292
00:34:07.277 --> 00:34:10.428
- I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?


293
00:34:10.597 --> 00:34:12.189
We'll help.

294
00:34:15.317 --> 00:34:17.433
Don't be long now.

295
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:29.989
We felt you'd be needing someone
to talk to. Especially now.


296
00:34:30.157 --> 00:34:32.466
What Laurette is trying to say

297
00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:36.516
is that we all have so
much in common these days.


298
00:34:36.677 --> 00:34:39.430
We do?

299
00:34:39.597 --> 00:34:42.475
We're all ordinance brides.

300
00:34:42.637 --> 00:34:43.956
Oh.

301
00:34:44.717 --> 00:34:47.106
Since you've never
been married before,


302
00:34:47.277 --> 00:34:51.270
we all thought we should
have a little chat.


303
00:34:52.677 --> 00:34:56.989
Do you prefer orange
pekoe or lapsang oolong?


304
00:34:57.157 --> 00:35:00.627
You see, a husband has certain rights.

305
00:35:00.797 --> 00:35:03.516
And a wife has certain duties.

306
00:35:05.677 --> 00:35:09.147
And that's where the trouble starts.

307
00:35:09.317 --> 00:35:12.468
Speak for yourself, Laurette.

308
00:35:19.877 --> 00:35:25.349
You know, I rode with Quantrill. Finest
revolver gang in history, till he died.


309
00:35:26.117 --> 00:35:28.756
Quantrill died?

310
00:35:29.437 --> 00:35:31.507
Last year.

311
00:35:35.477 --> 00:35:40.949
That Shorty, he don't even
ask. He just goes right to it.


312
00:35:41.117 --> 00:35:45.156
Those outlaws just don't know
how to take "no" for an answer.


313
00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.592
Whitey is so funny.

314
00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:51.909
Why, last night he got all
painted up like an Indian.


315
00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:55.069
And did he go on the warpath!

316
00:35:59.397 --> 00:36:02.787
Say, want to have yourself
a really wild time?


317
00:36:02.957 --> 00:36:05.312
Why not dress up like an Indian?

318
00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:11.307
That sounds like it oughta
be Julia's cup of tea.


319
00:36:17.477 --> 00:36:23.393
I guess I'll go on out and
see how the squaws are doing.


320
00:36:25.877 --> 00:36:29.313
I suppose what we're
trying to say, Julia, is


321
00:36:29.477 --> 00:36:33.152
it's not as much of a
chore as you may have heard.


322
00:36:33.317 --> 00:36:35.911
But, if it should become one,

323
00:36:36.077 --> 00:36:40.673
I have found that
the best thing to do

324
00:36:40.837 --> 00:36:46.070
is just think about canning apricots.

325
00:36:47.197 --> 00:36:48.835
Apricots?

326
00:36:49.477 --> 00:36:53.675
Well, for some reason,
apricots just seem to work best.


327
00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:01.236
How are we doing, ladies?

328
00:37:04.037 --> 00:37:05.470
Bye.

329
00:37:05.637 --> 00:37:10.392
- Thank you for the lovely gift.
- Let's do it again real soon.


330
00:37:21.277 --> 00:37:22.995
Nice folks.

331
00:37:25.237 --> 00:37:28.035
They seem content.

332
00:37:28.197 --> 00:37:29.516
Well...

333
00:37:30.477 --> 00:37:33.150
...you know what they say:

334
00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:38.914
"Lady love an outlaw like a
little boy love a stray dog. "


335
00:37:44.517 --> 00:37:47.315
We still haven't
cleaned up that table.


336
00:37:48.397 --> 00:37:53.790
You know, I was thinking
about them chairs of yours.


337
00:37:55.957 --> 00:38:01.429
Picking them up, setting them down
through the air. Why, it's poetry.


338
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:05.512
Think I'm getting a headache.

339
00:38:05.677 --> 00:38:09.829
Pretty soon, all over America,

340
00:38:09.997 --> 00:38:14.673
people's gonna be picking up
chairs and setting them down.


341
00:38:14.837 --> 00:38:17.192
It's gonna be all your doing.

342
00:38:27.197 --> 00:38:30.428
Julia...

343
00:38:30.597 --> 00:38:35.068
...what do you say we try
canning some of them apricots?


344
00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:46.667
"It would be like a
man hauling with one ox


345
00:38:46.837 --> 00:38:51.752
"and looking for two, hoping
for the help of the Lord.


346
00:38:51.917 --> 00:38:55.512
"Why not get rid of all the oxen

347
00:38:55.677 --> 00:38:59.067
"and count on the Maker all the way?"

348
00:39:03.437 --> 00:39:04.756
Very good.

349
00:39:04.917 --> 00:39:09.354
- I look forward to hearing it
on Sunday.  - Thank you.


350
00:39:09.517 --> 00:39:11.394
Morning, ladies!

351
00:39:12.637 --> 00:39:17.267
I sure did enjoy them
canned apricots last night.


352
00:39:26.117 --> 00:39:28.233
Julia!

353
00:39:44.317 --> 00:39:47.195
What the hell was that supposed to be?

354
00:39:48.077 --> 00:39:49.396
A joke?

355
00:39:49.557 --> 00:39:55.075
No. You don't understand. A joke
is when you make somebody laugh.


356
00:40:11.157 --> 00:40:14.274
Miss Tate. Please
step into the office.


357
00:40:14.437 --> 00:40:16.792
It's Mrs Moon.

358
00:40:16.957 --> 00:40:18.948
Excuse me. Miss Tate...

359
00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:21.950
- Why, you...
- Henry.


360
00:40:22.117 --> 00:40:26.156
I believe this is between
Mr Polty and myself.


361
00:40:37.197 --> 00:40:42.510
Hey, Moon! It looks like
the honeymoon is over.


362
00:40:43.797 --> 00:40:48.427
What's the matter, Moon? You
look like a dog without a bone.


363
00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:52.556
- Hey, Hector.
- Si.


364
00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:56.153
Why don't you go to the
Mexican side of town,


365
00:40:56.317 --> 00:40:59.150
see what the beans is jumping on?

366
00:40:59.317 --> 00:41:01.751
- Beans?
- Beans.


367
00:41:09.397 --> 00:41:13.185
You know, Polty's just
another word for chicken.


368
00:41:13.877 --> 00:41:15.674
Good one, Towfield.

369
00:41:15.837 --> 00:41:19.273
- Who thought it up for you?
- Let's go chew the fat.


370
00:41:19.437 --> 00:41:21.075
What for?

371
00:41:21.237 --> 00:41:24.946
'Cause I'm in a good mood.

372
00:41:25.117 --> 00:41:29.429
Well, how's about a little snort?

373
00:41:44.557 --> 00:41:47.151
Hey, Peachy.

374
00:41:57.997 --> 00:42:01.353
Bottle of mash and
two glasses, Norvell.


375
00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:08.675
- Not for him.
- What do you mean?


376
00:42:09.157 --> 00:42:12.786
- Sheriff's orders.
- Sheriff didn't tell me.


377
00:42:12.957 --> 00:42:17.872
You don't tell him nothing,
so he don't tell you nothing.


378
00:42:23.957 --> 00:42:25.834
Them's the breaks!

379
00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:42.475
You know, I owe you a special thanks.

380
00:42:42.637 --> 00:42:43.956
What for?

381
00:42:44.117 --> 00:42:49.987
What for? Hell, if you hadn't jerked
me back across the border to the...


382
00:42:50.157 --> 00:42:53.467
...just desserts, so to speak, why...

383
00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:56.435
...I'd never have
been married to Julia.


384
00:42:58.477 --> 00:43:01.196
Thinking on it that way, why...

385
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:07.593
...you sorta introduced us.

386
00:43:15.917 --> 00:43:20.388
Yeah, Towfield... things is good.

387
00:43:21.157 --> 00:43:24.593
You heard about matches
made in heaven, didn't you?


388
00:43:25.077 --> 00:43:31.073
- Well, I'm in one of 'em.
- Goddamn it, Moon! You stole my girl.


389
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:39.156
Take it easy, Towfield. You're
wrinkling my good luck bandanna.


390
00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:49.676
How's this?

391
00:43:49.837 --> 00:43:54.752
You give me the bottle and
I'll tell you the truth.


392
00:43:57.077 --> 00:43:59.750
You mean you was just japin' me?

393
00:44:01.877 --> 00:44:06.871
She puts chairs up on the wall
so people can't sit on them.


394
00:44:08.037 --> 00:44:10.153
What?

395
00:44:10.317 --> 00:44:14.230
I can't go into it,
Towfield, it's over your head.


396
00:44:14.397 --> 00:44:15.716
But it's bad, huh?

397
00:44:16.197 --> 00:44:19.189
Like eggs rolled in sand.

398
00:44:26.517 --> 00:44:29.554
Duck out back for a snort.

399
00:46:01.997 --> 00:46:05.876
Listen, amigo, don't
ever call me a bean again.


400
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:20.308
What the hell was that?

401
00:46:26.877 --> 00:46:28.868
Bye, Moon.

402
00:46:30.717 --> 00:46:33.595
This is as hard for
me as it is for you.


403
00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:36.317
A year ago last Christmas Eve,

404
00:46:36.477 --> 00:46:42.347
I had to move 150 Comanche souls
off their sacred burial ground.


405
00:46:42.517 --> 00:46:45.475
I know exactly how they felt.

406
00:46:45.637 --> 00:46:50.347
What's the matter, honey? You
look whiter than an albino.


407
00:46:50.517 --> 00:46:52.235
You been bothering my wife?

408
00:46:53.157 --> 00:46:55.910
We have 30 days to vacate.

409
00:46:59.437 --> 00:47:01.712
- What?
- This doesn't concern you.


410
00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:03.788
If it concerns her, it does me.

411
00:47:03.957 --> 00:47:08.587
The railroad's taking over
my land under eminent domain.


412
00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:14.717
Eminent domain. Ain't that where
somebody bribes the state legislature


413
00:47:14.877 --> 00:47:17.675
to take away some poor folks' land?

414
00:47:17.837 --> 00:47:23.753
- I won't dignify that with an answer.
- I ain't asking for no dignification.


415
00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:27.626
But I do find it interesting
that you prefer doing business


416
00:47:27.797 --> 00:47:30.675
with the lady of the house.

417
00:47:32.357 --> 00:47:34.075
Come on, Moon.

418
00:47:35.437 --> 00:47:38.986
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless
I am advised otherwise,


419
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:41.273
I'll be out to survey.

420
00:47:42.277 --> 00:47:44.188
You know...

421
00:47:44.357 --> 00:47:48.669
...Polty's just another
way of saying chicken.


422
00:48:09.397 --> 00:48:11.592
Whoa, William.

423
00:49:11.637 --> 00:49:15.710
They may be bold maids till they die

424
00:49:15.877 --> 00:49:17.390
Oh, yes.

425
00:49:21.037 --> 00:49:26.509
Mother says I mustn't Oh, George,
please George, not just yet


426
00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:30.795
Oh, yes. Swim, swim.

427
00:49:30.957 --> 00:49:32.629
Be naked.

428
00:49:33.877 --> 00:49:36.152
Oh, yes.

429
00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:41.274
Oh, I love you.

430
00:49:48.757 --> 00:49:51.317
Who's there? What are you doing?

431
00:49:51.477 --> 00:49:56.392
Oh, Julia. I was just
out here surveying.


432
00:49:56.557 --> 00:49:59.754
You liar! You were spying on me.

433
00:49:59.917 --> 00:50:03.034
Me? I never would do such a thing.

434
00:50:03.197 --> 00:50:04.630
Help!

435
00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:07.914
Julia. I swear on my honour.

436
00:50:08.077 --> 00:50:11.752
I didn't see a thing.
It's not what you think.


437
00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:14.670
- You old...
- What's going on here?


438
00:50:15.837 --> 00:50:19.796
- Nothing.
- Are you bothering my wife again?


439
00:50:19.957 --> 00:50:24.667
I was out surveying. There's my
equipment. My tripod, my maps...


440
00:50:24.837 --> 00:50:26.395
Caught you, didn't I?

441
00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:29.993
I swear, no. I wasn't doing anything.

442
00:50:30.997 --> 00:50:32.316
Then, apologise.

443
00:50:34.397 --> 00:50:36.467
- I apologise.
- All right.


444
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:41.235
Now eminent domain
your ass outta here!


445
00:50:41.917 --> 00:50:44.385
Ooh, nasty!

446
00:50:57.357 --> 00:50:59.632
What's the matter?

447
00:50:59.797 --> 00:51:01.469
Nothing.

448
00:51:01.637 --> 00:51:04.549
Why'd you stop laughing?

449
00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:09.833
I don't know. Get to work.

450
00:51:09.997 --> 00:51:11.350
I'd rather laugh.

451
00:51:12.117 --> 00:51:17.874
- That's all you like to do.
- No. That ain't all I like to do.


452
00:51:19.637 --> 00:51:21.548
No, Moon.

453
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:32.873
Ooh, nasty!

454
00:52:52.197 --> 00:52:54.074
Damn.

455
00:53:16.037 --> 00:53:19.473
- It's northern.
- Yeah.


456
00:53:22.157 --> 00:53:24.512
Did you get stung?

457
00:53:25.557 --> 00:53:26.876
Yes.

458
00:53:27.317 --> 00:53:28.716
Did you?

459
00:53:30.557 --> 00:53:32.354
Where?

460
00:53:43.917 --> 00:53:50.026
Outlaws don't know how to
take "no" for an answer.


461
00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:11.710
What are you doing down there?

462
00:54:14.477 --> 00:54:17.071
What are you doing down there?

463
00:54:17.957 --> 00:54:23.156
What am I doing? I guess I was
dreaming about tunnelling or something.


464
00:54:23.317 --> 00:54:26.832
Out! You got me drunk,
I don't remember a thing.


465
00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:31.434
- I didn't get you drunk.
- I will not have such talk here.


466
00:54:31.597 --> 00:54:33.792
You tricked me!

467
00:54:37.877 --> 00:54:39.276
I didn't trick you.

468
00:54:39.797 --> 00:54:43.233
Get your clothes and get
up, there's work to do.


469
00:54:43.397 --> 00:54:46.355
Oh, I get it.

470
00:54:46.517 --> 00:54:49.156
You're so afraid
you're gonna like that,


471
00:54:49.317 --> 00:54:51.877
that you'll forget the
gold and Philadelphia.


472
00:54:52.037 --> 00:54:55.109
Get your clothes and get out of here.

473
00:55:05.637 --> 00:55:07.753
Sonofabitch!

474
00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:10.351
I was right. All these years!

475
00:55:10.517 --> 00:55:15.466
Them painted ladies knows
how to appreciate a man.


476
00:55:15.637 --> 00:55:20.950
They don't got unnatural
questions. "How did it feel?"


477
00:55:22.437 --> 00:55:27.830
Dammit. I feel sorry for the poor
sonofabitch that winds up with you.


478
00:55:34.757 --> 00:55:37.225
Nice being married to you!

479
00:55:48.597 --> 00:55:51.111
You haven't got a plug nickel.

480
00:55:51.277 --> 00:55:54.075
You haven't even got a gun.

481
00:55:55.437 --> 00:56:00.033
You won't get 20 miles before a
posse'll get you and string you up.


482
00:56:00.197 --> 00:56:04.429
I only slept with you
so you'd keep on working.


483
00:56:04.597 --> 00:56:07.430
I hope they hang you.

484
00:56:27.037 --> 00:56:29.756
Not the curtain.

485
00:56:54.037 --> 00:56:56.597
You wouldn't dare.

486
00:56:59.877 --> 00:57:01.469
Well...

487
00:57:01.637 --> 00:57:05.073
...I hadn't thought of
it, but now you mention it,


488
00:57:05.237 --> 00:57:10.755
up in San Francisco I seen some
Chinese that done it this way.


489
00:57:10.917 --> 00:57:14.148
The Chinese is an old civilisation.

490
00:57:14.317 --> 00:57:19.107
They understand things about pleasure
that I've never even thought of.


491
00:57:21.317 --> 00:57:25.105
One thing's for sure: we
ain't had a boring marriage.


492
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:49.671
Deputy, how can you
do a thing like this?


493
00:57:50.677 --> 00:57:55.671
- But 15 days? That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.


494
00:57:57.437 --> 00:58:01.908
- We've been here since '43.
- Them's the breaks.


495
00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:13.147
Damn worthless black goo.

496
00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:51.311
I was just going into
town to buy an animal.


497
00:58:59.397 --> 00:59:03.185
Now, gentlemen, let's not
have no misunderstandings.


498
00:59:03.357 --> 00:59:06.394
Me and the little woman
haven't been getting along.


499
00:59:08.757 --> 00:59:10.952
Don't go in there!

500
00:59:17.797 --> 00:59:20.072
Where's the doctor?

501
00:59:25.397 --> 00:59:28.195
What's the matter? 
Where's the doctor?

502
00:59:28.357 --> 00:59:30.507
The doctor... Oh, yeah...

503
00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:33.154
I never got there.

504
00:59:33.317 --> 00:59:37.276
This pea-brain grabbed me
and stuck me in a wagon.


505
00:59:37.437 --> 00:59:39.997
It would've broke
your heart to see it.


506
00:59:40.157 --> 00:59:45.151
- You never told me about no doctor.
- You never asked.


507
00:59:45.317 --> 00:59:47.751
Is something wrong, Julia?

508
00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:51.273
- Female trouble.
- Oh, the vapours.


509
00:59:53.157 --> 00:59:59.596
- I'd better put you to bed, darling.
- I just got out of bed, darling.


510
00:59:59.757 --> 01:00:03.432
What the hell d'you pick
him up for, Towfield?


511
01:00:03.597 --> 01:00:06.748
- He was dressed like a Mexican.
- That's not illegal.


512
01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.748
I told him.

513
01:00:12.397 --> 01:00:14.831
Well...

514
01:00:14.997 --> 01:00:17.750
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.

515
01:00:19.677 --> 01:00:20.996
I told him.

516
01:00:21.157 --> 01:00:24.069
I told you but no, you wouldn't...

517
01:00:39.357 --> 01:00:41.154
You missed me, didn't you?

518
01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:43.714
I did not!

519
01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:49.429
I can see it. Them eyes
ain't angry. They're relieved.


520
01:00:49.597 --> 01:00:51.474
And they ain't bloodshot.

521
01:00:51.637 --> 01:00:55.425
- I wanted you back to work the mine.
- No.


522
01:00:55.597 --> 01:00:59.351
You missed Old Man in the Moon.

523
01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:02.873
Hell, I got my faults,
I admit it, but...


524
01:01:03.037 --> 01:01:06.791
Hell, I got my ways, too.

525
01:01:08.437 --> 01:01:11.747
I missed you a little bit, too.

526
01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:14.147
I did.

527
01:01:14.317 --> 01:01:19.266
When I was heading for the
border, I couldn't stop thinking


528
01:01:19.437 --> 01:01:23.112
that nobody's ever
saved my life before.


529
01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:28.032
I just couldn't leave you in
your time of need... of me.


530
01:01:34.037 --> 01:01:37.427
It's been quite a day.

531
01:01:37.597 --> 01:01:42.717
I'm a bit tuckered out. I
think I'll take a poco siesta.


532
01:01:43.237 --> 01:01:46.354
Oh, you don't have
to sleep in the barn.


533
01:01:47.477 --> 01:01:50.708
You can sleep on the couch.

534
01:01:52.957 --> 01:01:55.551
Say when.

535
01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.668
When.

536
01:02:04.837 --> 01:02:06.236
Rats.

537
01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:51.829
That's it for me.

538
01:02:51.997 --> 01:02:54.192
I'm too young to die.

539
01:02:59.717 --> 01:03:02.026
You don't understand.

540
01:03:03.317 --> 01:03:06.195
I understand about dreams.

541
01:03:06.997 --> 01:03:10.069
I understand about waking up, too.

542
01:03:11.477 --> 01:03:15.550
I wanted to ride with the Younger
Gang, they wouldn't have me.


543
01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:19.630
Claimed I wasn't cut
out to be a Younger.


544
01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:24.268
My feelings was hurt,
but I accepted it.


545
01:03:29.797 --> 01:03:34.587
You know, for an outlaw you've
been a pretty good friend.


546
01:03:49.957 --> 01:03:52.232
What's the matter?

547
01:03:54.117 --> 01:03:55.675
Gold!

548
01:03:55.837 --> 01:03:59.352
Good Lord Almighty, I found gold!

549
01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:03.116
Watch out.

550
01:04:04.117 --> 01:04:07.029
Don't knock into none of these beams.

551
01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:13.866
I know it's around here
somewhere. I can feel it.


552
01:04:14.037 --> 01:04:15.755
I don't see nothing.

553
01:04:15.917 --> 01:04:20.388
It's here. Believe me, it's here.

554
01:04:32.997 --> 01:04:35.227
Goddamn!

555
01:04:38.717 --> 01:04:42.187
Oh, goddamn! Look at that, gold.

556
01:04:42.357 --> 01:04:47.033
- It's all over everything.
- Moon, I told you. Didn't I tell you?


557
01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:50.746
Honey, kiss me. I'm rich.

558
01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:53.750
Goddamn, I am rich!

559
01:04:57.197 --> 01:05:03.955
You wait long enough, and pretty soon
down it's gonna come right on you.


560
01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:08.508
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.

561
01:05:13.757 --> 01:05:20.151
You know, I'm gonna get my
initials put on my saddle in gold.


562
01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:24.105
They like it that way
down there in Mexico.


563
01:05:38.077 --> 01:05:43.276
All we gotta do now is deposit this
first bunch in the bank and then...


564
01:05:43.437 --> 01:05:47.589
We? What do you mean, we?

565
01:05:48.597 --> 01:05:53.717
Just that, in all fairness, I
played a part in striking the gold.


566
01:05:53.877 --> 01:05:56.596
You never believed it existed.

567
01:05:57.397 --> 01:06:01.948
But you'd've never struck it
if it wasn't for me. Correcto?


568
01:06:03.117 --> 01:06:05.187
So?

569
01:06:05.357 --> 01:06:09.316
So, where's my share of the stake?

570
01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:13.992
You're right.

571
01:06:15.997 --> 01:06:18.192
I'll give you ten percent.

572
01:06:19.797 --> 01:06:25.429
You don't understand. You see,
sharing is giving to each other.


573
01:06:28.677 --> 01:06:30.952
Fifty percent.

574
01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:36.355
We'll talk about it later.

575
01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:38.795
All right, all right.

576
01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:44.192
Twenty-five percent and we can
stop this conversation right here.


577
01:06:55.437 --> 01:06:59.396
Must be funny depositing
something in a bank, huh, Moon?


578
01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:03.232
Yeah, it's a whole
new experience for me.


579
01:07:04.597 --> 01:07:07.589
We're sorry to have
you and Miriam leave us.


580
01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.190
Thank you.

581
01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:13.145
What with the railroad and this
black stuff springing up everywhere,


582
01:07:13.317 --> 01:07:17.310
a man just can't grow
a decent ear of corn.


583
01:07:24.237 --> 01:07:27.035
Awful heavy for figurines.

584
01:07:27.717 --> 01:07:30.629
It's my whole collection.

585
01:07:31.037 --> 01:07:35.667
- I'll guard it with my life.
- You can do better than that, Whitey.


586
01:07:54.877 --> 01:08:01.146
- Henry Lloyd Moon in the bank.
- Want one of these?


587
01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:02.636
Sure.

588
01:08:11.917 --> 01:08:16.752
Goddamn it. I like being rich.

589
01:08:18.357 --> 01:08:23.351
Maybe now you can buy your
way into the Younger Gang.


590
01:08:26.077 --> 01:08:32.186
Darling, I think I'll buy me a
little cantina south of the border.


591
01:08:32.357 --> 01:08:35.349
Time to start living the good life.

592
01:08:36.357 --> 01:08:40.509
Goddamn it, honey.
I'm gonna be a patrón.


593
01:08:41.437 --> 01:08:46.557
Tequila, cards, señoritas.

594
01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:53.069
Hey, wait till the Dominguine
sisters get a load of me!


595
01:09:08.597 --> 01:09:11.634
Don't do that, you're acting foolish.

596
01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:17.347
Maybe you oughta try it.

597
01:09:26.677 --> 01:09:29.953
You want to see something foolish?

598
01:09:34.317 --> 01:09:36.069
That's foolish.

599
01:09:37.797 --> 01:09:39.788
Fifty percent?

600
01:09:45.757 --> 01:09:49.796
You're gonna give me fifty percent?

601
01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.996
We're partners, aren't we?

602
01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:05.632
Well, if you're gonna
put it that way, yeah.


603
01:10:10.797 --> 01:10:14.585
I don't know how to say this, Henry.

604
01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:16.876
But...

605
01:10:17.877 --> 01:10:20.675
...I think I got...

606
01:10:20.837 --> 01:10:25.706
...greedy and selfish
living alone so long.


607
01:10:32.157 --> 01:10:35.274
Well...

608
01:10:35.437 --> 01:10:37.997
...that's how you get.

609
01:10:38.837 --> 01:10:41.305
Once you get started...

610
01:10:42.837 --> 01:10:46.068
...you don't hardly
ever get out of it.


611
01:10:57.197 --> 01:10:59.347
For calling me Henry.

612
01:11:49.717 --> 01:11:53.346
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.


613
01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:56.793
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.


614
01:12:08.717 --> 01:12:10.150
Well...

615
01:12:11.117 --> 01:12:13.233
Sorry to keep you waiting, but...

616
01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:16.230
...me and the missus was playing fish.

617
01:12:16.397 --> 01:12:19.867
Thought we'd stop by and
bring you a little shivaree.


618
01:12:20.037 --> 01:12:23.427
- Did you?
- Since we ain't been formally invited.


619
01:12:23.597 --> 01:12:28.227
Well, me and Julia was just
saying the other day how we was...


620
01:12:28.397 --> 01:12:30.035
...gonna have you all out.

621
01:12:30.197 --> 01:12:37.273
- You sure got your wish, didn't you?
- I damn sure did.


622
01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:41.953
- Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
- Why, sure, honey pie.


623
01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:54.027
- Don't you know how to wipe your feet?
- Hey, old Coogan. Wipe your feet off.


624
01:13:04.157 --> 01:13:06.148
Hope you like taffy.

625
01:13:07.357 --> 01:13:09.234
It was my idea.

626
01:13:09.757 --> 01:13:11.395
Thank you.

627
01:13:15.877 --> 01:13:17.469
They call me Big Abe.

628
01:13:23.157 --> 01:13:26.706
Ol' Henry still snore in his sleep?

629
01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:39.794
I want them out of here.

630
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:42.346
- Not as much as I do.
- Moon!


631
01:13:42.517 --> 01:13:45.827
You want them to find
out about the dust?


632
01:13:52.797 --> 01:13:54.788
Well...

633
01:13:55.677 --> 01:13:56.996
Anybody hungry?

634
01:13:57.157 --> 01:14:01.275
Hungry? Shit, I could
eat a frozen dog.


635
01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:08.348
Well, we'll go to the kitchen and
see if we've got one already froze.


636
01:14:09.117 --> 01:14:12.507
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.

637
01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:27.953
A feast fit for a king.

638
01:14:28.117 --> 01:14:31.666
That's his speciality. Them
pork bellies make it tasty.


639
01:14:31.837 --> 01:14:35.352
Did you know Henry used
to cook for the Raiders?


640
01:14:35.517 --> 01:14:40.989
He cooked for Quantrill's
Raiders? No, he never told me that.


641
01:14:41.157 --> 01:14:44.547
I bet there's a
lot he never told you.

642
01:14:44.717 --> 01:14:46.355
Shit!

643
01:14:46.517 --> 01:14:49.190
Goddamn, Abe. There's ladies present.

644
01:14:49.357 --> 01:14:52.588
Easy, you'll loosen my molar up.

645
01:15:06.037 --> 01:15:08.949
Just play along a little while longer.

646
01:15:09.117 --> 01:15:12.234
You go, I don't want
to spoil your fun.


647
01:15:12.397 --> 01:15:15.514
I ain't having a
good time, I swear it.


648
01:15:17.237 --> 01:15:23.756
Just trying to throw them off the track.
Wouldn't be me if I wasn't acting wild.


649
01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:32.029
Forget about all this and go and
have a good time. Act foolish.


650
01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:06.747
Shit.

651
01:16:06.917 --> 01:16:09.715
This ain't no real marriage.

652
01:16:11.637 --> 01:16:16.153
Come on. Meet me tonight, huh?

653
01:16:16.317 --> 01:16:19.150
I'll give you my old coyote call.

654
01:16:19.837 --> 01:16:21.236
Remember?

655
01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:25.148
Not now.

656
01:16:32.037 --> 01:16:35.268
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?

657
01:16:36.037 --> 01:16:37.436
No.

658
01:16:38.797 --> 01:16:44.155
But if I do, can I put it under
my pillow for the tooth fairy?


659
01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:48.953
You won't get nothing for it.

660
01:16:49.117 --> 01:16:52.951
Come on boys, let's help Big
Abe find his goddamn molar.


661
01:16:53.117 --> 01:16:55.426
Wait, I have a better idea.

662
01:16:55.597 --> 01:17:02.275
Moon, let's go and buy Big Abe a
whole goddamn set of gold teeth.


663
01:17:04.117 --> 01:17:07.075
You'll ruin everything,
acting like a fool.


664
01:17:07.237 --> 01:17:12.994
I don't give a goddamn what
anybody says, I'm a gentleman.


665
01:17:13.677 --> 01:17:16.555
And I'm not gonna
throw up in this house,


666
01:17:16.717 --> 01:17:21.871
I'm going outside to throw up,
'cause I respect your house.


667
01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:28.594
Big Abe, you can throw up
in this house any old time.


668
01:17:43.517 --> 01:17:49.592
Goddamn gold, that sonofabitch
is keeping gold from us.


669
01:17:49.757 --> 01:17:53.636
Got no money! Sonofabitch!

670
01:18:05.317 --> 01:18:07.512
You almost spilled the beans.

671
01:18:07.677 --> 01:18:11.465
Come on and help me
find Big Abe's molar.


672
01:18:11.637 --> 01:18:17.428
Didn't I tell you to watch what you
was doing? You don't understand outlaws.


673
01:18:17.597 --> 01:18:21.272
I understood you when you
told me to act foolish.


674
01:18:21.437 --> 01:18:25.589
I didn't tell you to get
drunk and sing your head off.


675
01:18:25.757 --> 01:18:30.831
- Hog liked my singing.
- That's why they call him Hog!


676
01:19:44.637 --> 01:19:46.992
Damn, Hermine!

677
01:19:51.357 --> 01:19:54.429
Quit that goddamn
coyote calling, I'm here.


678
01:19:54.597 --> 01:19:56.792
You're wife's acting
terrible, ain't she?


679
01:19:56.957 --> 01:20:01.508
No, she's just had a
little too much bug juice.


680
01:20:02.637 --> 01:20:08.792
Now I figure you ain't had
much of anything in a long time.


681
01:20:12.957 --> 01:20:17.792
How come you and the boys
decided to stop by tonight?


682
01:20:18.437 --> 01:20:21.315
I wanna make it real
good for you, Henry.


683
01:20:21.477 --> 01:20:24.787
Hermine, you ain't
hearing my question. God!


684
01:20:24.957 --> 01:20:28.313
- What was it?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.


685
01:20:28.477 --> 01:20:31.648
I appreciate the coyote calling
and all, but...


686
01:20:31.749 --> 01:20:34.570
... I told you, things have changed.

687
01:20:34.837 --> 01:20:38.307
Crawl in, Henry, and see what I got.

688
01:20:38.477 --> 01:20:41.708
You ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.


689
01:20:41.877 --> 01:20:46.632
It was swell. We had some times
together I'll never forget.


690
01:20:46.797 --> 01:20:49.595
But Hermine, now I'm took.

691
01:20:54.957 --> 01:20:58.632
Hold it. That's enough.

692
01:21:00.117 --> 01:21:02.950
- Don't shoot.
- Vamoose.


693
01:21:07.957 --> 01:21:14.066
If I was monkeying around,
would I still have my clothes on?


694
01:21:16.117 --> 01:21:18.551
Then why'd you go out there?

695
01:21:18.717 --> 01:21:20.469
Don't make no difference.

696
01:21:20.637 --> 01:21:23.754
No matter what I say,
you won't believe me.


697
01:21:27.477 --> 01:21:29.786
Go ahead.

698
01:21:32.677 --> 01:21:36.795
Well, I was just trying to
get information off of Hermine.


699
01:21:37.637 --> 01:21:40.788
That wasn't all you
wanted to get off of her.


700
01:21:40.957 --> 01:21:46.031
All I wanted to know is if they
knew anything about the gold.


701
01:21:46.557 --> 01:21:49.833
You care more about
the gold than about me.


702
01:21:50.677 --> 01:21:52.190
That ain't true.

703
01:21:52.357 --> 01:21:57.556
I could've done what you
think I done, but I didn't.


704
01:21:57.717 --> 01:21:59.275
I don't believe you.

705
01:22:00.237 --> 01:22:03.832
I was there strictly on business.

706
01:22:03.997 --> 01:22:08.787
You want that woman! Take
her, but forget about the gold.


707
01:22:10.397 --> 01:22:14.026
People can't afford business
partners that cheat on them.


708
01:22:14.877 --> 01:22:18.586
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.


709
01:22:18.757 --> 01:22:24.150
- You can't do that to me.
- I just did.


710
01:22:33.197 --> 01:22:38.829
That tears it. Gotta put the
old double X to Henry Moon, huh?


711
01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:41.465
Well, we'll see.

712
01:22:41.637 --> 01:22:44.151
Now, you want your gun back, Moon?

713
01:22:51.077 --> 01:22:52.795
Where's the goddamn gold?

714
01:22:54.157 --> 01:22:59.595
- What gold?
- That gold right there, where is it?


715
01:23:00.277 --> 01:23:04.065
You aren't quite as ignorant
as you look. Come on in.


716
01:23:04.237 --> 01:23:07.593
- How much we got here?
- Enough.


717
01:23:07.757 --> 01:23:10.874
Actually, I was just
coming looking for you boys.


718
01:23:11.037 --> 01:23:12.356
Sure you was.

719
01:23:16.037 --> 01:23:18.426
We're gonna hit the Longhorn bank.

720
01:23:18.597 --> 01:23:23.148
There ain't nothing in that
chickenfeed bank but sun-filled windows.


721
01:23:23.317 --> 01:23:27.913
- And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.


722
01:23:28.077 --> 01:23:30.716
- Not yet.
- You got a plan?


723
01:23:30.877 --> 01:23:35.667
I'm gonna make that woman
sorry she ever said, "I do. "


724
01:24:00.397 --> 01:24:03.355
- He's hiding something.
- I don't think so.


725
01:24:03.517 --> 01:24:06.827
- I know so.
- I knew he had a plan.


726
01:24:06.997 --> 01:24:10.353
Me, too, but I don't
know if we're in on it.


727
01:24:10.517 --> 01:24:14.829
- Let's keep a watch on him.
- Come on, gang.


728
01:24:26.637 --> 01:24:30.676
You better take a rest
before your arm falls off.


729
01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:43.195
You want some water?

730
01:24:48.277 --> 01:24:50.472
Are you always this quiet?

731
01:24:52.877 --> 01:24:55.710
I got nothing to say.

732
01:24:59.917 --> 01:25:02.715
I keep my word.

733
01:25:51.877 --> 01:25:53.276
Honey?

734
01:25:54.997 --> 01:25:58.910
Honey, are you all right? Goddamn.

735
01:26:01.677 --> 01:26:04.111
- Are you all right?
- Yes.


736
01:26:04.277 --> 01:26:06.507
Watch it. That's it, all right.

737
01:26:11.157 --> 01:26:13.955
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.


738
01:26:15.957 --> 01:26:18.869
OK, there's a light.

739
01:26:46.757 --> 01:26:50.955
- You all right?
- Well, I been better.


740
01:26:54.717 --> 01:26:59.233
It's all right, nothing's
gonna happen to you.


741
01:27:00.077 --> 01:27:02.910
Here, hold this. 
You stay right here.

742
01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:10.830
When I get back, we'll
take a little Spanish pause.


743
01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:14.029
Now...

744
01:27:46.437 --> 01:27:48.553
Henry Lloyd?

745
01:27:49.157 --> 01:27:50.988
What?

746
01:27:51.797 --> 01:27:53.788
Nothing.

747
01:28:55.677 --> 01:28:57.986
I'm sorry about last night.

748
01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.272
I know it doesn't matter, but...

749
01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:06.272
...if we're going to die,
I want it to be as partners.


750
01:29:06.437 --> 01:29:08.632
Fifty-fifty.

751
01:29:11.997 --> 01:29:14.591
We was a good team.

752
01:29:14.757 --> 01:29:19.308
Good? Shit, we were the best.

753
01:29:19.477 --> 01:29:22.071
- Honey pie.
- Moon...


754
01:29:22.237 --> 01:29:25.274
...I been thinking, since
we're gonna go anyway,


755
01:29:25.437 --> 01:29:29.430
why don't we go out
in a blaze of glory?


756
01:29:30.877 --> 01:29:33.345
Tie me up.

757
01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:38.829
We're alive!

758
01:30:19.077 --> 01:30:22.467
- I been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.


759
01:30:22.637 --> 01:30:27.347
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till ten.


760
01:30:27.517 --> 01:30:30.475
There's been a little change in plans.

761
01:30:32.037 --> 01:30:34.028
I gotta tell Big Abe.

762
01:30:34.197 --> 01:30:36.506
You gotta do what you gotta do.

763
01:30:37.037 --> 01:30:39.153
I'll never forget you, Hermine.

764
01:30:39.317 --> 01:30:43.833
You was the first woman I
didn't have to pay for. Adios.


765
01:32:08.957 --> 01:32:13.553
- You're a mite early, compadre.
- I wanna make a withdrawal.


766
01:32:13.717 --> 01:32:18.393
Your wife will have to do that. Us
ordinance husbands aren't allowed to.


767
01:32:18.557 --> 01:32:24.712
- Besides, we're closed.
- You're open now.


768
01:32:24.877 --> 01:32:27.072
Open it up.

769
01:32:30.037 --> 01:32:31.470
Over there.

770
01:32:32.277 --> 01:32:34.268
Hurry up, buddy.

771
01:32:37.957 --> 01:32:39.356
Cover that up.

772
01:32:41.397 --> 01:32:43.592
I never thought you'd
do this to Julia.


773
01:32:43.757 --> 01:32:47.306
It's the only way to
save my marriage, Whitey.


774
01:33:43.597 --> 01:33:46.634
Grover, where's Julia?

775
01:34:35.197 --> 01:34:37.950
Damn.

776
01:34:38.117 --> 01:34:39.709
Rocks.

777
01:34:53.357 --> 01:34:55.951
Damn, honey pie.

778
01:35:07.837 --> 01:35:09.634
Reach, Moon.

779
01:35:14.797 --> 01:35:17.869
Mr Moon, you're still here.

780
01:35:20.157 --> 01:35:21.590
Where's Julia?

781
01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:24.233
Guess he ain't heard the news.

782
01:35:25.717 --> 01:35:30.108
- What news?
- Your wife sold up to the railroad.


783
01:35:30.717 --> 01:35:33.072
Gentlemen, start
tagging the furniture.


784
01:35:33.237 --> 01:35:36.513
- When?
- Does that concern you now?


785
01:35:37.117 --> 01:35:39.870
Where is she?

786
01:35:40.037 --> 01:35:42.710
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.

787
01:35:43.877 --> 01:35:46.516
And you're going to meet Saint Peter.

788
01:35:46.677 --> 01:35:50.875
That's right, Moon. You're
going to meet señor Peter.


789
01:36:00.357 --> 01:36:03.554
- We know you got it.
- I ain't got nothing.


790
01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:05.389
We don't believe you.

791
01:36:06.197 --> 01:36:09.633
- Ain't got what? Who's
that? - The ex-Moon Gang.


792
01:36:13.677 --> 01:36:17.875
They picked the wrong
hombres to mess with.


793
01:36:24.157 --> 01:36:26.068
Watch it, Big Abe.

794
01:36:27.557 --> 01:36:30.629
OK. One, two, three!

795
01:36:35.877 --> 01:36:40.473
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?


796
01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:44.906
About a half hour ago.

797
01:36:49.957 --> 01:36:51.595
Now!

798
01:36:56.837 --> 01:36:59.146
Moon, shoot back.

799
01:37:27.917 --> 01:37:31.592
Yessum, this is mighty strange stuff.

800
01:37:31.757 --> 01:37:34.988
Miriam dropped the lantern
in some the other night,


801
01:37:35.157 --> 01:37:38.627
and the whole farm
near went up in flames.


802
01:37:38.797 --> 01:37:43.393
- Burned half the hair off my head.
- It stunk for two weeks.


803
01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:45.912
The railroad has no use for it.

804
01:37:46.077 --> 01:37:50.309
So I thought I'd take these
samples East and maybe sell it.


805
01:37:50.477 --> 01:37:53.275
What do you think, Miss Julia?

806
01:37:57.637 --> 01:38:01.949
I'm sorry, Mr Standard. I
didn't hear what you said.


807
01:38:21.957 --> 01:38:23.834
Drop that gun.

808
01:38:23.997 --> 01:38:26.636
Hold it there!

809
01:38:26.797 --> 01:38:28.116
Hold it there!

810
01:38:28.597 --> 01:38:31.111
All right, stay calm.

811
01:38:35.077 --> 01:38:39.389
All right. Step down, Julia.

812
01:38:40.877 --> 01:38:43.516
That sonofabitch can shoot.

813
01:38:43.677 --> 01:38:46.066
He rode with Quantrill.

814
01:38:49.037 --> 01:38:51.676
Come on. You've run far enough.

815
01:38:52.797 --> 01:38:57.666
Come on, now. I'm losing my patience.

816
01:39:04.637 --> 01:39:09.108
- You ain't taking my gold!
- Hey, they discovered gold!


817
01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:12.394
No, they just had too much bug juice.

818
01:39:12.557 --> 01:39:15.708
You didn't even write
a note when you left.


819
01:39:15.877 --> 01:39:19.950
What was I meant to write,
"Good luck Henry and Hermine"?


820
01:39:21.077 --> 01:39:23.716
I was gonna explain everything...

821
01:39:23.877 --> 01:39:27.028
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?

822
01:39:27.197 --> 01:39:31.270
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll
blow everybody into feathers.


823
01:39:34.997 --> 01:39:38.387
We don't desert our
women out here, Mr Moon.


824
01:39:38.917 --> 01:39:44.913
It's all right, Sheriff. You go on
ahead. He's just trying to impress me.


825
01:39:45.077 --> 01:39:47.830
Are you sure, Julia?

826
01:39:51.277 --> 01:39:55.953
Well... you two try
and get along, then.


827
01:39:58.517 --> 01:40:00.314
We all had to.

828
01:40:17.677 --> 01:40:22.432
My heart froze when I came
home and you was gone, honey.


829
01:40:24.837 --> 01:40:27.909
Let me help you up with it.

830
01:40:42.757 --> 01:40:45.908
I'm not sure I'll ever
get used to Mexico.


831
01:40:46.077 --> 01:40:52.152
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?


832
01:40:52.317 --> 01:40:54.069
Anyways...

833
01:40:54.237 --> 01:40:58.196
...first, let's get
used to being rich.
