[gasps]

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.480
Uh, you wanna sleep here tonight
or go to your place?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.680
Your publisher. 
Don't ignore the question.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.960
Mm. Well, I don't think
they'll even remember me.

[editor] Sorry about that.

33
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200
The people at the printers
are such a pain.

[sharp inhale] Hm. 
Well, maybe not.

41
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.760
The book's been sent out already
to a few important critics


42
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.360
and the feedback's been great.

You look like a deer in headlights.

44
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.400
Sorry, I'm a little bit nervous.

45
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.000
It could help you relax to, uh…

46
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.200
To start writing part two.

47
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.240

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.640
The characters in our novels
are also invited.


53
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.280
-It's him, right?
-No, it isn't.


54
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.120
Ah… Sorry, you can…
you can bring whoever you wanna bring.


55
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.080
But if it's the Greek god, better.

Lolo, look at this.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.240
Wow. You look so pretty in the photo.

63
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.640
It's a professional photo.
Like some VIP, right?


64
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
Use this one.

-[sighs]
-I miss him too, all the time.


68
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.040
He's looking down smiling.

69
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.000
-Let's make a toast.
-[Apolo] Yeah.


70
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.000
To the best agent, and to the window.

71
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.000
-[Apolo] Cheers.
-The best agent.


72

[Daniela] That was awesome.

73
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.760
[Raquel] Are you trying to
steal my points?


74
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.160
It's my turn.

75
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.360
Let me take a guess.

76
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.000
[Daniela] I think I'm winning.

77
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.960
[Victor] She dumped you
and you can't get over her.


78
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.320
Wrong.

79
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.040
[Daniela] Yeah. 
Pass me another.

80
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.760
We all have an unforgettable ex.

81
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200
Don't let it get to you.

82
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.120
Wrong again.

83
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.680
She's my girlfriend.

84
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.120
Interesting relationship.

85

He misses you.

Artemis does too, I think.

99
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.640
I miss them too.

I think they kinda look
like the ones I saw back there.


120
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.360
[Gregory] You like
the lavender too, right?

We'll get it. One sec.

Hey. Home for Christmas?

'Tis the season for it.

How are you?

145
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.040
It's like the tropics here
compared to Stockholm, I'd imagine.

Well, actually, not really.

The Hidalgos don't like
putting on the heater.

No. We're going back on the first.

[Vera] Yep and on the second,
we'll pick up the keys

Well, we'd better look for more ornaments.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.320
Yep.

158
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.160
There's a whole lot to choose from
and you don't want to mess up.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.120
[Vera] Come on! I thought I saw
a hot chocolate stand over there.


164
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.920
[church bells ringing]

165
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.320
[Gregory] Well, you have to admit
they make a perfect couple. Right?


166
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
[camera shutter clicks]

167
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.720
[Daniela] A little to your…
to your right, yeah.


168
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.240
Let the ribbons fall nicely.

169
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.160
Tell me exactly
how this whole thing works.


170
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.440
When two people
are under the mistletoe they have to kiss.


171
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.840
[Artemis] She's making it up.
Don't believe a word she says.


172
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.000
-Sugar?
-Oh.


173
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.040
It's true, Artemis.

174
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.960
We've never done
this kiss thing in this family.


175
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.880
Look.

176
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.200
[Daniela] There you go, perfect.

177
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.920
See? I don't need mistletoe
to kiss my daughter.


178
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.280
-[Claudia] You're just…
-I'm what?


179
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.120
[Apolo] We're not big kissers
in this family.


180
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.000
Dani, guess what!
We just saw Raquel and Gregory.


181
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.400
Ah! You did?

182
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.440
[grunts]

183
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.560
-[Claudia] Daniela, you explain.
-Uh, what?


184
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.040
How does mistletoe work?

185
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.360
Whoever's under it has to kiss.

186
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.040
You make up
some horrible traditions to kiss.


187
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.120
-Oh my God, enough.
-It's not. No, come on.


188
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.160
None of you are gonna convince me.
It's horrible.


189
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.840
-And it's unsanitary.
-[Ares] Shall we?


190
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.400
[Artemis] What if I was a stranger?

191
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.120
There's no way I'm going around hugging
and kissing everyone like Santa Claus.


192
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200
[Claudia] We'll see about that
at the Martínez's.


193
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.000
[Artemis] Uh, I haven't confirmed yet.

194
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.760
It's not an option. 
He's gotta be there.

195
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.960
I feel bad for my parents,
Claudia. And for them.


196
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.800
I can't leave them on Christmas Eve.

197
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.640
Don't worry. We never really celebrate it.

198
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400
Well, that's your opinion.

199
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.560
All set!

200
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.720
-So pretty.
-Very nice.


201
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.320
-You're an artist.
-[doorbell rings]


202
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.160
-[Gregory] Hey, Roberto!
-[Tere] Hi.


203
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.320
-Hello.
-[door closes]

[kissing]

205
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.200
-Mm.
-[Tere] Oh, thank you.


206
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.640
Where's your daughter?

207
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.160
Raquel, can you say hi to Roberto?

208
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.640
-[Roberto] Hey, this tastes amazing!
-[Tere] What's in it? Garlic?


209
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.920
[Gregory] Yes. Minced.

210
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.120
You can come for dinner
every night if you want.


211
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.480
-Mom, please.
-I said if he wants to.


212
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.400
You don't have to cook
every time you come over.


213
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.640
Well, I like it.

214
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.160
Leave him alone. If he wants
to be the best boyfriend ever, let him.


215
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.880
You could try too.

216
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.120
I doubt I'd be able to cook
something like this for Christmas Eve.


217
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.920
[Tere] Don't worry. I'll pretend
it's the best thing I ever tasted.


218
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.920
-[Roberto] Looks great, Gregory.
-[Gregory] Thanks.


219
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.720
You're not having dinner here
Christmas Eve?


220
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.000
I told you his family
and I are having dinner.


221
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.120
You didn't say that.

222
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.320
[Tere] You're finally getting rid
of your mom, honey. Enjoy it.


223
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.880
If you don't have plans, come with us.
You'd be more than welcome.


224
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.840
-[Gregory] Wine?
-Yeah.


225
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.600
And you can check out my library.

226
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.560
Roberto is cultured and sexy.

227
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.600
You're the one who's sexy.

228
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.440
You did not tell me anything
that you were doing Christmas Eve.


229
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.720
I did tell you. I know I did. I just think
you have your head in the clouds lately.


230
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.920
Okay, so because
I'm a little bit distracted,


231
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.880
I'm abandoned by my mother
for the holidays.


232
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.720
That is not what's going on here.

233
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.000
If you want to join Roberto and me,
then be my guest.


234
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.640
He's really not so good
at cooking, but he tries.


235
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.560
-[Roberto] I promise I'll keep trying.
-Whatever.


236
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.760
[Tere] Well, you're welcome to come over
and practice whenever, honey.


237
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.040
[Roberto laughs]

THROUGH THE WINDOW THIS MORNING?

245
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.480
[Vera] Hey, the Wi-Fi's not working.
Do you know what's up?


246
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.720
No. I don't know.
Maybe Apolo changed the password.


247
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.520
[sighs] Well, my mom's waiting for me.

248

Hello? Hey, Mom! How are you?

249
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.800
What's up with the flight?
Okay, so, when do you land?


250
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.480
On the 30th or the 31st?
Just check and let me know,


251
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.320
so I know when
to go get you. Okay?

[Vera] Yeah, sounds good…

260
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.560
DO I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN, 
OR CAN YOU REPLY?

261
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.240
[Gregory] You know, we could
have dinner together tomorrow.


262
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.360
With your family?

263
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.760
Just us. You and me.

264
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.240
Mhm.

265
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.320
My parents are working in the restaurant.

266
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.080
I've made my own plans for years.

267
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.600
If your mom's gone,
we can host it here.

268
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.440
We can invite some friends, my sister.

269
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.360
Hm.

270
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.760
Why not? Tell me.

271
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.200
Because I have to
work at the toy shop,

272
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.040
I have to write,
and I can't get distracted.


273
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.440
Yeah. Got it. Okay.

274
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.480
Working, writing, being mean,
it's a full schedule.


275
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.720
I'm not being mean.

would have been appreciated.


317
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.000
You would've told me no.

318
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.200
-Of course I would have.
-And you know why?


319
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.920
You care about him.

320
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.120
Of course you care.
He was your boyfriend, it makes sense.


321
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Let's turn the page.

322
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.520
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.


323
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.240
Now, you've got new people
in your life who care about you.


324
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.600
[Vera] I can't wait to dive in.

325
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.080
I care about you so much.

326
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.640
[Daniela] Yeah, yeah, 
I got you, girl!

327
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.640
-Let's go in.
-Mhm.


328
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.560
[Vera laughs]

329
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.960
-[Gregory] Madame?
-[Sammy] Please.


330
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.920
[Daniela] Me too, please.

331
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.040
[Vera] Can someone explain to me
the science of being allergic to chlorine?


332
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.200
[Ares] It's not that weird.

333
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.040
[Vera] Well, Ares, normally, people
are allergic to things like peanuts.


334
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.040
Chlorine allergies are a little weird.

335
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.960
[Marcos] As kids, everyone
wanted to be allergic to chlorine,


336
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.680
like Ares, so we could
skip swimming class. [laughs]


337
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.840
[laughs] Really?

338
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.840
[Anna] I want wine too.

339
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920
There was that one time,

340
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.320
remember when we threw you
in the pool to see if it was true?


341
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.000
And this guy, he
went and ratted us out!

342
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.600
Ow! Watch it. Careful.

343
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.120
-You're gonna spill it.
-[Vera] Thanks for saving his life.


344
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.960
Oh, no, you're welcome.

345
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.920
But if I had known that years later
he'd finish all the bottles of wine,


346
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.400
I wouldn't have done it.

347
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.680
Ani. Ani! You okay?

348
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.360
-It's up the stairs.
-How 'bout you, Dani?


349
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.720
What are you allergic to?

350
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.800
[Daniela] Uh, pollen and Hidalgos.

351
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.480
-[laughter]
-[Vera] Tell me about it.


352
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.640
[Sammy] Hey, that's right.

353
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.360
[Vera gasps] Really?

354
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.520

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.320
[Sammy] Marcos, you remember the 26th?

359
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.960
-LOLO?
-I'M WITH VÍCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL.


360
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.000
HE BROKE HIS WRIST.
THEY'RE GONNA PUT IT IN A CAST.


361
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.520
This boy tries to act all romantic
but he's actually a mess.


362
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.520
He invited me over to watch a movie
and eat pepperoni pizza.


363
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600
Hey, come on. Help me with these plates.

364
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.040
[Sammy] I hate pepperoni.

365
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.800
-It was a mistake.
-How can you forget that?


366
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.280
-I thought it was ham.
-Yeah, sure. The ham, ham.


367
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.040
-Hey, but still, it's nice, right?
-Let me get that out of your way.


368
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.680
[Raquel] Yes, with love
I may see it as a gesture.


369
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.360
[Gregory] Should we leave some for Apolo?

370
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.960
Well, Víctor has a broken arm
and he's gonna get a cast on it.


371
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.600
[Gregory] Who's Víctor?

372
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.520
-No idea.
-Hm.


373
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.000
Put the phone down
and help me with the plates, please.


374
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080
[Daniela] Yeah, one sec.

375
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.520
-I know.
-[Gregory] Careful.


376
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.320
-It was something, at least.
-Okay.


377
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.480
I mean, creative
because you're a bit of a mess, huh?


378
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.080
[Marcos] I can't be perfect.

379
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.400
[Sammy] Yeah, yeah. Anyway.

380
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.680
[Marcos] It is what it is.

381
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.800
[Vera] That's cute.

382
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.480
Cockroach! Come here.

383
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.920
[Gregory] I've told you
a thousand times not to call me that.


384
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.880
Oh, poor thing.

385
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.960
[Sammy laughs]

386
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.920
[Sammy] He loves it.

387
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.040
[Marcos] Thanks a lot.

388
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.920
[Gregory] So, Dani.
Do you know the Uncle Christmas song?


389
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.880
-Who's that? Is that like Santa Claus?
-[Marcos] Mm, who's gonna tell her?


390
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.000
[Gregory] Ah, sorry to tell you
but here in Barcelona,


391
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.000
we don't let old magical obese dudes
in our homes.


392
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.920
What?

393
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.880
<i>Ooh, uncle, uncle, poop out some sweets</i>

394
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.800
[Vera] What the hell?

395
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.240
<i>If you can't poop then you'll get beat!</i>

396
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.720
-Why?
-<i>Boom!</i>


397
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.400
It's a Catalan thing, don't ask.

398
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.800
-[Gregory] t's a constipated log.
-[Daniela laughs]


399
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.080
-[Vera] Wow!
-[Sammy] Basically.


400
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.480
[Vera] So it just shits the presents, huh?

401
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.800
[Sammy] Yeah, well…

402

THE DIVINE COMEDY

405
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.640

which circle of hell you're in.

-It's your first stethoscope.

It's nice, thanks.

-[Martha] Did you have enough to eat?
-Huh?


413
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.480
Did you have enough to eat, Artemis?
Do you want more nougat? Hm?


414
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560
-Uh, no thanks.
-I know you like egg yolk nougat.


415
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.840
-Thank you.

What?…

So, what kind of job do you have?

Uh…

428
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.080
He's the director
of operations for a company.

might use common sense.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.760
It was really rough, man.

623
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.920
But then all of a sudden,
you appear with Vera.


624
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.120
You introduce us to her family and boom!

has now become our fairy godmother, right?


627
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.920
He has good taste.

628
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.840
Not like others.

[man] Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

631
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.880
He keeps getting more and more like Dad.

632
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.760
[man] Give me a sec. 
Okay, how's that?

633
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.240
[photographer] Okay.
Gather round here. I need everyone.


634
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.160
Good morning.

635
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.840
[man] I think everything's set up.
Make sure there's no cables…


636
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.720
Watch out, 'cause you know you're next.

637
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.640
[man] Okay.

638
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.080
Can you move that against the wall?
I can't focus with it there.


639
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.400
[woman] Ladies, gentlemen,
we're starting in about five minutes!


640
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.760
[man] Yes, sounds good.
We're all set. Thank you, Paula.


641
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.120
All right, final checks. Good here.

642
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.480
[Sofía] You can take those hoops off,
if you want.


643
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.280
-Well, they're--
-[Sofía] They're unrefined.


644
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
Pearls are always the best choice.
They're like ties.


645
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.720
[Sofía] Mhm.

646
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.760
Something more formal
would be better for the photo.


647

[Claudia sighs]

648
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.160

[Vera] Yeah.

653
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.760
Okay, excuse me. Here we go.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.960
[photographer] Ares,
you stand next to her.


655
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040
Okay.

656
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.400
This one's the worst family tradition.

657
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.760
I hope you know
what you're getting yourself into.

[Claudia] Is Daniela not coming?

660
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.720
-[Apolo] No. No, I spared her.
-It's okay, it's okay.


661
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.560
-Here?
-[photographer] Perfect.


662
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200
Okay, now.

663
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.480
Put one hand
upon her shoulder, please, Ares.


664
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.000
-What?
-Uh, put your hand on Vera's shoulder.


665
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.440
And Vera, can you put your hand
on top of his, please?


666
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.720
-Yeah.
-[photographer] Great. Look at the camera.

I'm already here.
I'm at the theater waiting for you.

Hurry. You're coming, right?

Going in?

685
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.280
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

686
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.480
[usher] You can't stay here.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.040
Uh, it's okay. 
He's almost here.

What about you, Apolo?
Did you just get here?

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.280
[Apolo] No. I just got dressed early.

than ever, and I'm going to be a dad,

and I can give my daughter
everything she deserves.

How are you?

Don't worry about the money.

The company's booming right now.
You're talking to the future president.

So I might've gotten carried away.

<i>And</i>

1254
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.320
I guess that's why I started writing.
It was my way of loving.


1255
01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.480
Um…

1256
01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.800
My feelings were so intense,
I didn't understand


1257
01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.520
what was happening to me
until I wrote it down.


1258
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.880
It was my way
to keep contact with reality.


1259
01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.800
Hello, sweetheart.

1260
01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.520
As if to say Raquel, this is happening.

1261
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.120
Your crush is coming
through the window and he's not a vampire.


1262
01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.760
And well, um…
so, writing has come to help me,


1263
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.520
uh, really see the world. 
And to shape it.

1264
01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.800
And especially, to understand
what I was feeling about everything.


1265
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.440
Later, I read what I'd written
and thought, Raquel, you're crazy.


1266
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.120
But it… But it
was actually what I needed.

1267
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.720
Yes?

1268
01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.480
Does that mean
we should be expecting a part two?

Well, I started writing it,
but… but I abandoned it.


1272
01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.480
I'm not trying to understand love anymore,

1273
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560
I just want to experience it now.

-Hello.


1277
01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.600
Wait.

1278
01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.600
Just a minute, 
I'll be right back.

1279
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.360
Sorry, Raquel.

1280
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.120
We should bring one to him.

1281
01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.920
After all, we're here because of him.

Listen, I helped you unload 200 boxes
when you started school.

We're almost done, Hera.

We're leaving right now or I'm going
to the Tibidabo all by my self.

You should blame your godfather for that.

Alright, alright, but she can forgive me
for anything, right? Huh?

You owe me an ice cream
with three scoops, okay?

Three scoops?

It's the first and last time
you trick me into helping you move.

No, no. I'm not sure yet.
