1
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:25.580
Taylor have you had breakfast?

2
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.782
I'm not hungry.

3
00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:28.898
Not acceptable!

4
00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.312
Gotta go figure out what the latest
public relations crisis is today.


5
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.315
Who are you calling a brat?

6
00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:07.379
Private!

7
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.218
What you do online isn't
exactly private.


8
00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.406
Oh! I almost forgot.

9
00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.135
It's your birthday!

10
00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:17.544
Mmm! Don't forget
to get me a present!


11
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.918
I'm gonna tie a string
around my finger.


12
00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:20.960
Good.

13
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.032
Eric!

14
00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:24.606
Don't you dare miss your bus again!

15
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.400
It wasn't my fault last time!

16
00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:38.694
Hey did you see my bag?
I need my bag.


17
00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:43.661
What you need is a brain.

18
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:45.950
You can't hit me on my birthday!

19
00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:51.652
Why does everybody think
I should have a party?


20
00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:53.397
Turning 17 doesn't mean anything.

21
00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.915
You're crazy. A party means
presents money, bling.


22
00:01:57.015 --> 00:01:59.808
If your dad have move out 3 months
ago you wouldn't want a party.


23
00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:02.032
Hey you know that's not it.
I don't care about that.


24
00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:04.796
I think we should do what you did
for your 11th birthday party.


25
00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.220
We just got our nails done.

26
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.614
and the smell was so bad
we all got sick remember?


27
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.973
I'm pretty sure Julie bryson
even threw up.


28
00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:12.567
Did you hear Julie's pregnant?

29
00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.361
What? Wait, how would you know?
She moved to Florida.


30
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:17.212
Clicksters. Hello!

31
00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.094
Oh of course.

32
00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:21.243
...She was upset.

33
00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:26.350
So, what did you say the other day in
health that got Lindsay so pissed off?


34
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.434
Nothing! I just said it's
better to wait until you're 18.


35
00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:30.778
Before you go all the way.

36
00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:32.322
She's been doing it since 9th grade.

37
00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:33.832
You basically called her a slut.

38
00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:34.826
- Yeah!
- I did not!


39
00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.905
It was a class discussion.
I wasn't talking about her.


40
00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:40.878
My brother wears shoes like that.

41
00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:42.322
He's 10.

42
00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:45.146
- Don't you love High School?
- So great.


43
00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:46.302
Best years of our lives.

44
00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:47.390
- Wonderful.
- Amazing.


45
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.619
Uh definition of "contrarian"?

46
00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.813
Me. Definition of "lazy": You.

47
00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:53.402
Do your own homework.

48
00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:54.816
Look at you!

49
00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:57.901
Taylor you're a "brainiac".
You should know.


50
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:00.713
Let's have it.

51
00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:05.431
Oh the definition of "lust".

52
00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.170
When I look at him my
throat swells up.


53
00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.245
You do know that Scott
is just a dumb jock right?


54
00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.507
- No he's not!
- Okay!


55
00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:13.607
If you were on clicksters.

56
00:03:13.707 --> 00:03:17.047
You could send him a hot metre
quiz and find out if he likes you.


57
00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:18.800
Stop!
That is so 6th grade.


58
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.484
Even if I wanted to I couldn't.

59
00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:23.572
My mom like stands over my
shoulder the whole time.


60
00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:25.586
She has computer-monitoring software.

61
00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:27.095
She goes on all the
sites I've been on.


62
00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.492
There's no way.
See you later.


63
00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:30.482
Bye.

64
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:31.678
Her mom is so backwards.

65
00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.262
She can't even have
Internet on her phone.


66
00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:35.716
Ah! How does she lived?

67
00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:40.089
On this day in history the great
bard William Shakespeare


68
00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.856
took his first breath in 1564.

69
00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:48.410
The very first motion picture
was shown in 1896.


70
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.196
Theodore Roosevelt delivered his
man in the arena speech in 1910.


71
00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:55.299
Also on this day in history.

72
00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:57.031
Just a little closer to home

73
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.043
Taylor Hillridge was born.

74
00:03:59.168 --> 00:04:00.554
Happy Birthday Taylor.

75
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:04.147
Happy Birthday.

76
00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:05.471
Thanks.

77
00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.338
Today's my dad's birthday too.

78
00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:13.358
Cool.

79
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:14.493
All right class.

80
00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:20.013
If you would open your book
to unit 11 page 773,


81
00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:22.183
we'll look at turbulent time.

82
00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:24.935
I swear when he touched my shoulder.

83
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.956
There was like electricity.

84
00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:26.921
Oh please.

85
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:29.330
No I'm serious!
I felt a tingle.


86
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.569
You think he'd ask
me to the spring fling?

87
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.296
- No!
- Why?


88
00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:35.433
Scott Ozsik is not the romantic type.

89
00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.972
He's a basketball player on
the same team as Charlie.


90
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.228
Okay he's not like Charlie.

91
00:04:42.244 --> 00:04:43.338
He is exactly like Charlie.

92
00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:45.869
And I would know because
I hung out with them.


93
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.921
Yeah once.

94
00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:49.455
Yeah. Charlie hooked
up with me.


95
00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:52.788
He got what he wanted and he
never spoke to me ever again.


96
00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.756
I know. I'm sorry. I know how
much that sucked.


97
00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:00.392
He's not like Charlie.

98
00:05:00.394 --> 00:05:04.650
He is exactly like Charlie and it's
stupid for you to lose your head.


99
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:07.111
Over something silly like this.

100
00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:10.284
Okay, Remember it was your
dad who left you guys


101
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:11.654
for a 25-year-old girl.

102
00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:14.099
If that doesn't tell you
how scummy guys are...


103
00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.182
Hey leave my dad out of it okay?

104
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:16.876
It's so late.

105
00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:21.242
Thank you.

106
00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.638
My own computer?

107
00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:27.997
Aw lucky!

108
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.500
Wait, hang on.

109
00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:32.442
Though, there has to
be a catch like uh...


110
00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:33.723
I can only use it in the kitchen

111
00:05:33.823 --> 00:05:35.426
I can't use it after 1:00

112
00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:37.606
Or you have to share it with me.

113
00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:38.581
No stop. There's no catch.

114
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.979
It's all yours, private.

115
00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.737
You can use it wherever you
want if you follow my rules.


116
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.698
No inappropriate sites and no
giving out personal information.


117
00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:50.604
I know the rules but still, you're
trusting me? Are you feeling okay?


118
00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:52.995
You're funny. Look I know you
think I'm overprotective.


119
00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:55.878
But the word is "responsible".
Yeah, try "suffocating".


120
00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:57.398
I'll let that one slide bithday girl.

121
00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:58.650
Look, you wanna be a journalist,

122
00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:00.605
and I want you to write
to your heart's content.


123
00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:03.908
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!


124
00:06:03.923 --> 00:06:05.009
I'm gonna go hook it up.

125
00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:06.199
I'll come help!

126
00:06:06.212 --> 00:06:07.501
You touch, you die.

127
00:06:12.707 --> 00:06:14.449
Do you know if your father
called Taylor today?


128
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.597
Don't think so.

129
00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.590
Well, she told him she didn't want to
speak to him ever again, so...


130
00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.965
Okay.

131
00:06:24.463 --> 00:06:25.992
What is my favourite body part?

132
00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:27.936
I have to answer these
questions on my profile?


133
00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:29.830
Just say "eyes".
Everybody says "eyes".


134
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.618
I said "butt".

135
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.818
You can get away with
it because everybody


136
00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.813
knows you are all
talk and no action.


137
00:06:34.913 --> 00:06:35.746
I'm putting "eyes".

138
00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.767
- Shut up!
- Stop!


139
00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:40.150
Wait, hang on. What kind of
underwear am I wearing right now?


140
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.354
- Oh my God!
- Just say "pink".


141
00:06:42.454 --> 00:06:44.683
Everybody says "pink".
I said "black".


142
00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:47.042
- You don't own black underwear!
- Black?


143
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:50.540
Seriously, what's the point
of answering these questions,


144
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:51.460
if they're all untrue?

145
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.833
Fine! Tell everybody about
your virginal white undies.


146
00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:55.944
They're not all white!

147
00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.937
You're not gonna get
cute guys talking to you.


148
00:06:58.037 --> 00:07:00.500
You'd be surprised how many guys
ask me about my black underwear.


149
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.825
- Oh What?
- Now do you get it?


150
00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:03.984
- Okay all right.
- It makes sense?


151
00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:06.487
- But I'm not putting "black".
- Or "white".


152
00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:09.021
I'll put "blue". I'll put "blue".
That's good.


153
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.995
What was that?
It just beeped.


154
00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.374
Friend request. Click there.

155
00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.411
Okay... Oh!

156
00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:18.192
- Ooh!
- It's Scott.


157
00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:19.686
Okay now when you post your answer.

158
00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:22.275
He'll be picturing you
in your underwear.


159
00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:25.783
I'm friends with Scott!

160
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.759
Hello?

161
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.650
Yeah, thanks for calling.

162
00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:56.243
Listen I'm looking over the numbers.

163
00:07:56.263 --> 00:08:00.368
and what you gave me on line 56...

164
00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:27.085
Hey!

165
00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:29.396
Lindsay commented on our photo.

166
00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:31.071
Oh Lindsay!

167
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.319
Hang on.

168
00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:41.169
Oh that's not very nice.

169
00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:43.114
I don't even know which one
I'm supposed to be,


170
00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:45.364
Lardo or dogface?

171
00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:46.568
I guess I'll be dogface.

172
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.115
What if I wanna be dogface?

173
00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:49.892
Well fine.
Then I'm lardo.


174
00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:52.029
I could always lose
a little bit of weight.

175
00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.678
You however will always
look like a dog.


176
00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:10.815
Thanks.

177
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:13.969
Maybe it was a freudian slip.

178
00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:17.281
You know, maybe you don't like history.

179
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.031
So you accidently dropped your book.

180
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:20.786
Get it?

181
00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:23.005
I don't know. I like history.

182
00:09:23.175 --> 00:09:24.289
Oh me too.

183
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:25.064
Oh!

184
00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.060
It's my favourite.

185
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:32.130
Caleb's kind of a weird dude huh?

186
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.239
Yeah a little bit.

187
00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.228
So I saw you're on clicksters now.

188
00:09:36.328 --> 00:09:38.412
I like it better than facebook.
A lot more raw you know?.


189
00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:39.917
Yeah I noticed.

190
00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.226
So maybe I'll talk to you
on there tonight?


191
00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:45.749
Uh yeah. You mean like
instant message or something?


192
00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:48.288
There's actually a chat
room just for the school.


193
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.134
I hang out there sometimes
when I'm bored.


194
00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:51.946
People talk trash.
It's kind of funny so..


195
00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:54.350
Ha! okay I'll look for it.

196
00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:55.769
- Cool.
- Okay.


197
00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:25.044
Oh what now? I'm a loser?

198
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:36.379
That's true.

199
00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:45.464
What?

200
00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:47.283
Is that clicksters?

201
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:48.653
Can you make me an account?

202
00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:50.982
- No!
- Please just don't... why?


203
00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:53.559
No! Get out of my room,
you little worm! Go!


204
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.460
Aw! I hate you!

205
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.396
It has been decided.
I am officially Lardo.


206
00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:05.364
All thanks to the queen
of mountain High School.


207
00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:08.138
Why does she call herself
lindsayluv online?


208
00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:09.442
It's such a contradiction.

209
00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:12.361
Does she have bionic hearing or what?

210
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.220
Oh! Sorry!

211
00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.419
- Taylor hey.
- Hi


212
00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:21.242
Um I was actually reading
your page last night and...


213
00:11:21.342 --> 00:11:23.491
- Oh!
- You're a really good writer.


214
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.825
Oh! Well, thank you.

215
00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:27.429
But I do think you need
a few more pictures.


216
00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:30.122
Maybe a bikini shot or something.

217
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:32.421
Okay I'll think about it.

218
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:34.460
- See you later.
- Bye.


219
00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:38.550
A bikini shot? Come on!

220
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:40.742
- He was joking!
- You are so naive!


221
00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:43.736
I can think of at least 2 girls he's
hooked up with in the past month.


222
00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:48.063
If you count just kissing
then I can think of 3 girls.


223
00:11:48.713 --> 00:11:50.562
What? He's popular!

224
00:11:51.822 --> 00:11:53.871
Wait hang on. Don't turn.
Drop me off first.


225
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.950
Why? We always go
to the mall on Friday.


226
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.408
I wanna go home and see
if Scott goes online.


227
00:11:58.698 --> 00:12:00.527
Okay you're now officially pathetic.

228
00:12:00.627 --> 00:12:02.841
Come on. I think it's cute.
Let her be in love.


229
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:04.525
It's not love!

230
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.859
I'm sorry but waiting
for a guy to type:

231
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.388
"hey baby.
Send me a bikini shot"


232
00:12:08.488 --> 00:12:09.583
is not love!

233
00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:12.531
Then what is, sleeping with a guy
the 2nd time you guys go out


234
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:15.150
and then wondering why he
never talks to you again?


235
00:12:20.697 --> 00:12:21.469
Get out.

236
00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:22.416
What?

237
00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:24.745
- You can't be serious?
- Out.


238
00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:39.333
Samantha gets so intense.

239
00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:40.987
Yeah I know. It's fine.

240
00:12:41.087 --> 00:12:42.911
She'll be all right tomorrow.

241
00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:44.765
Besides it was totally worth it.

242
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.164
Scott talked to me
for like half an hour.

243
00:12:47.404 --> 00:12:49.293
He sent me 13 messages.

244
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.550
Wow! You think he likes you?

245
00:12:51.753 --> 00:12:53.411
I don't know. Probably not.

246
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:55.081
I know he talks
to a lot of girls.

247
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.589
Oh hang on. Maybe this is him.

248
00:13:01.577 --> 00:13:05.605
Huh! No, it's a friend request
from some guy named James.


249
00:13:05.705 --> 00:13:08.559
Whoa Cheyenne this guy's
like totally gorgeous.


250
00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:11.039
It says he's 17 and he
goes to ridgeway.


251
00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:12.329
Oh my cousin goes there.

252
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.671
Whoa listen to this.

253
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.914
"read your poem about
hiking Mount Maynor,


254
00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:19.303
was there last summer and felt like
the wind was talking to me too


255
00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:22.537
heard its voice in my soul
just like you said,


256
00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:25.730
made me wonder if talking to you
would be the same kind of thing."


257
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.064
- So he has a brain.
- Yeah and a soul!


258
00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:33.911
- Should I write him back?
- Um if you don't, I will.


259
00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.997
Eric, it's your turn.

260
00:13:43.366 --> 00:13:44.896
What did you learn today?

261
00:13:46.365 --> 00:13:47.589
Stuff.

262
00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:48.944
Like?

263
00:13:50.443 --> 00:13:51.477
Dad's in California.

264
00:13:51.577 --> 00:13:52.637
You talked to him?

265
00:13:52.746 --> 00:13:53.951
Yeah he called me.

266
00:13:55.341 --> 00:13:56.900
Maybe he called me.

267
00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:22.567
What is it?

268
00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:24.393
Look! Somebody figured
out my password


269
00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:25.676
and they hacked my profile!

270
00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:26.554
How do you know?

271
00:14:26.555 --> 00:14:28.694
Look what they wrote,
look at the status!


272
00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:35.086
"I'm a naughty bad girl, someone
should spank me."


273
00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:37.114
Well, someone has a
sick sense of humour,


274
00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:38.611
you gotta change this, you should
change your password.


275
00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:39.748
No one should look at this.

276
00:14:50.263 --> 00:14:51.782
It's too late.

277
00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:24.277
- You okay?
- No!


278
00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:26.107
Who do you think changed your status?

279
00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:27.995
Who knew your password?
I don't know! I don't know!


280
00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:31.348
I made Samantha and Cheyenne
look away when I set it up.


281
00:15:31.448 --> 00:15:33.192
Taylor, I looked around this website.

282
00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:35.286
It's completely inappropriate for
someone your age.


283
00:15:35.386 --> 00:15:36.761
There are no boundaries.

284
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.583
You need to shut
down your profile.


285
00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:39.014
Come on!

286
00:15:39.114 --> 00:15:40.349
Look at you!

287
00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:42.633
You're in tears after one day!

288
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.487
Just shut it down.

289
00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:52.183
It's not worth it.

290
00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:56.201
Honey it's not worth it.

291
00:16:31.214 --> 00:16:32.012
Hello?

292
00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:33.191
Hey.

293
00:16:34.692 --> 00:16:36.761
Hey are you still in a "pissy" mood?

294
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:38.930
Shut up and come over.

295
00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:42.198
You can put what happened
in your status right?


296
00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:43.621
And then you change
your password.


297
00:16:43.622 --> 00:16:44.812
Not to something easy
like your birthday.


298
00:16:44.912 --> 00:16:46.676
Yeah. It wasn't my birthday before.

299
00:16:46.776 --> 00:16:48.936
Or like anything anyone could've guessed.

300
00:16:51.174 --> 00:16:53.263
God all those things people
were saying about me.


301
00:16:53.363 --> 00:16:55.417
How am I gonna face going
to school on Monday?


302
00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:56.911
Don't be a wuss.

303
00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:59.080
You can't take that stuff seriously.

304
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.158
Besides nobody's even gonna
remember it by Monday.


305
00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:05.362
Hey one good thing happened
on clicksters today.


306
00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:07.596
I talked to this guy named James.

307
00:17:07.936 --> 00:17:09.830
What? You should've seen
what he wrote me.


308
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.310
It was like really smart and funny.

309
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.822
Oh! Let's not
talk about boys.


310
00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:17.931
We can rent a movie,
you can sleep over.


311
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.670
Okay fine.

312
00:17:31.226 --> 00:17:32.216
Hello?

313
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.900
Good morning.

314
00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:45.977
What's going on?

315
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:47.506
Eric.

316
00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.415
Tell her.

317
00:17:55.412 --> 00:17:56.438
Me and my friend Cooper
were the ones


318
00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:57.546
that changed the status
on your profile.


319
00:17:57.646 --> 00:17:58.261
What?

320
00:17:58.361 --> 00:18:00.151
You used the old cat's
name for your password.


321
00:18:00.158 --> 00:18:01.149
I'm gonna kill you!

322
00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:05.130
Taylor come back here please.

323
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.256
- I can't believe he did that to me!
- Taylor!


324
00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:12.584
Look, I am really upset with him too.

325
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.810
I've grounded him for a month.

326
00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:17.301
But I'm really upset with you too.

327
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:17.969
What did I do?

328
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.915
I looked to see if you
took down your profile.


329
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:21.269
I never said I'd do that.

330
00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:23.957
Well on your page you
posted a comment


331
00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.882
and called someone a bitch.

332
00:18:25.982 --> 00:18:27.983
Whoa! Now you're spying on me?

333
00:18:28.077 --> 00:18:29.843
Taylor, when you put something online
it's no longer private.


334
00:18:29.913 --> 00:18:32.124
Everyone can see it and
you know my rule.


335
00:18:32.224 --> 00:18:34.758
You can't use the Internet to be
insulting or call anyone names.


336
00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:36.851
- What about what they called me?
- I know it's terrible.


337
00:18:36.968 --> 00:18:41.649
But that's no excuse to be ugly
to someone online or anywhere.


338
00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:44.708
okay, fine. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.


339
00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:47.138
To make sure you won't do it again
I'm taking away your laptop.


340
00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:47.721
Oh come on.

341
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.869
Going on the Internet means
responsibility and consequences.


342
00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:52.744
You'll get it back in 3 days.

343
00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:54.433
Wonderful.

344
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:55.612
Eric!

345
00:18:55.712 --> 00:18:57.701
Taylor behave yourself!

346
00:18:58.317 --> 00:19:00.653
I can't believe your own
brother did that to you.


347
00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:01.130
Yeah.

348
00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:03.793
It's disgusting. It's gross.
I'm never going to forgive him.


349
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.634
"I'm not going to your graduation.

350
00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:07.584
"I'm not going to your wedding.

351
00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:09.565
"I might go to your funeral."

352
00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:13.474
Damn! Tayhill actually
came to school today.


353
00:19:13.793 --> 00:19:15.383
I owe you 5 bucks.

354
00:19:15.912 --> 00:19:17.122
What's your problem?

355
00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:19.031
Oh I don't have a problem.

356
00:19:19.131 --> 00:19:22.684
You do little miss
I'd-never-go-all-the-way.


357
00:19:22.784 --> 00:19:24.148
Such a hypocrite.

358
00:19:24.248 --> 00:19:26.992
How many guys did you hooked
up with this weekend?


359
00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:29.071
Ten? Twenty?

360
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.945
You should have
a drive-thru.


361
00:19:35.153 --> 00:19:37.462
You said everyone was
gonna forget it by Monday.


362
00:19:37.562 --> 00:19:40.351
Okay people have been posting really
stupid stuff On your page all weekend.


363
00:19:40.483 --> 00:19:40.944
What?

364
00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:43.684
I mean they were just, they're
saying you sleep around.


365
00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.178
Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:48.211
Well Samantha didn't want
to freak you out and...


367
00:19:48.311 --> 00:19:50.685
I honestly thought it would
die down by now.


368
00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:53.022
Well I have to see.
Give me your phone.


369
00:19:53.023 --> 00:19:54.128
I have to see what's going on.

370
00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:55.696
No. You don't have to
see it right now.


371
00:19:55.797 --> 00:19:56.711
Yeah, I have to see it right now.

372
00:19:56.712 --> 00:19:58.576
If everyone's seen it that
mean Scott has seen it.


373
00:19:58.676 --> 00:20:00.186
Please, can I use your phone?

374
00:20:00.187 --> 00:20:02.529
No Taylor, I'm not gonna
give you my phone.


375
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.529
I saw what people were
saying about you online.


376
00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:26.767
I don't know why
they have to do that.

377
00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:30.705
It sucks.

378
00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.274
How would you know?

379
00:20:35.563 --> 00:20:36.952
You serious?

380
00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:42.070
You've been called
a slut and a whore, really?


381
00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:46.743
I guess you've never been on my page.

382
00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:48.941
There's fairy...

383
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.525
fruit, homo.

384
00:20:52.405 --> 00:20:53.523
Too gay to live.

385
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.288
Yeah but I mean it's not
really the same thing.


386
00:20:55.327 --> 00:20:57.882
I mean you really are gay.

387
00:20:57.982 --> 00:21:00.151
What they're saying about
me isn't true.


388
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.009
You really don't get how
messed up it is.


389
00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:22.425
I sit behind you
in algebra. You smell weird.


390
00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:24.064
That's what skanks smell like.

391
00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:26.198
What like puke?

392
00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:28.847
Jealous much?
She's smarter than you.


393
00:21:31.096 --> 00:21:33.504
"then why doesn't she know
she's a loser?"


394
00:21:33.884 --> 00:21:37.522
And then James wrote: "haters suck.
The girl is more cool than you."


395
00:21:37.952 --> 00:21:39.586
He defended me.

396
00:21:39.686 --> 00:21:41.351
He is a gentleman.

397
00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:45.159
Ah I'm gonna write him
back And say thank you.


398
00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:48.877
Ask him if he knows my cousin.

399
00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:58.102
You all finished?

400
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:01.150
Then back to your room.

401
00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:03.171
You're gonna keep me a
prisoner for a month?


402
00:22:03.172 --> 00:22:04.291
Yeah she is.

403
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.039
Taylor!

404
00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:08.487
Honey you really need to
go to your room.


405
00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:14.924
Dad would've never let you ground
me for something this stupid!


406
00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:19.668
I get my laptop back tomorrow right?

407
00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:22.145
Yeah. You gonna take
your profile down?


408
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:24.083
Are you saying I have no choice?

409
00:22:24.286 --> 00:22:26.773
No I'm saying I'm trusting
you to make the right choice.


410
00:22:26.873 --> 00:22:29.177
Well who says that's the right choice?

411
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.824
You know everyone at
my school is on that site.


412
00:22:33.926 --> 00:22:35.387
I was just having fun.

413
00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.856
It was Eric who messed
it all up for me.

414
00:22:39.702 --> 00:22:43.365
You know I wish
you wouldn't fake-trust me.


415
00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:45.839
I wish you would just actually do it.

416
00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:56.564
It's the seedy underbelly
of the underworld.


417
00:22:56.611 --> 00:22:57.393
Oh my God!

418
00:22:57.493 --> 00:22:59.442
- I know! Look at her!
- Ah!


419
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.509
I'm not gonna let it bother me.

420
00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:07.333
You know I don't care what they think.

421
00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:09.094
That's what James told her.

422
00:23:09.194 --> 00:23:10.821
I let her borrow my phone.

423
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:12.476
Look what he said.

424
00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:15.224
"even though we've never met
I feel like I know you.


425
00:23:15.302 --> 00:23:16.863
"you make me melt."

426
00:23:17.073 --> 00:23:18.380
Is this guy for real?

427
00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:20.200
I can't believe
I'm actually encouraging this.


428
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.661
Yeah why are you encouraging this?

429
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:23.981
I think it's good or you
to see the difference


430
00:23:23.982 --> 00:23:25.824
between a guy that
is genuinely nice to you


431
00:23:25.924 --> 00:23:28.266
and a guy that just wants
to hook up with you.


432
00:23:28.594 --> 00:23:29.754
Whoa, wait, you don't like
Scott anymore?


433
00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:31.594
Like that was ever gonna happen.

434
00:23:31.694 --> 00:23:33.680
Why not? Thirteen messages.

435
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.906
That's a lot of messages.

436
00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:36.983
Yeah, but Scott was this fantasy guy.

437
00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:39.488
That might like me if I was different,

438
00:23:39.566 --> 00:23:42.100
but James likes me for who I am.

439
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.019
Now I just need my computer back.

440
00:23:44.058 --> 00:23:45.277
So I can write him back.

441
00:23:45.371 --> 00:23:48.258
- See, that sounds like love.
- It might be.


442
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.753
Oh I need ketchup. Hang on.

443
00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:52.386
- Oh! Sorry.
- Sorry.


444
00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.638
I was just going to get ketchup.

445
00:23:54.972 --> 00:23:55.914
Oh me too.

446
00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:59.342
I was actually gonna come
look for you after lunch.


447
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.830
You were?

448
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:02.635
Yeah I heard somebody
hacked your profile.


449
00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:04.971
It happened to me once.
Sucked really bad.


450
00:24:05.049 --> 00:24:06.834
My brother did it.
That's what's even worse.


451
00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:09.142
- Oh man your brother, really?
- Yeah.


452
00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:10.994
You think I should have a chat
with him, straighten him out or?..


453
00:24:11.012 --> 00:24:12.079
Please yes.

454
00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:15.689
No but seriously I
was gonna come find you.

455
00:24:15.853 --> 00:24:19.223
I kinda wanted to see if you wanna go
to the spring fling dance with me.


456
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.599
You're asking me to the dance?

457
00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:24.305
I mean if you're already going with
someone That's totally cool.


458
00:24:24.405 --> 00:24:25.867
Oh no!

459
00:24:27.523 --> 00:24:28.198
I mean yes!

460
00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:30.192
I mean no I'm not going with anyone.

461
00:24:30.292 --> 00:24:32.101
And yes I will go with you.

462
00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:33.116
Yeah?

463
00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:34.205
- Yeah.
- Okay cool.


464
00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:37.204
Well, why don't you send me a
message give me your number.


465
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:39.613
- Okay sure.
- Okay.


466
00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:45.959
Why did you tell him
you weren't going with anyone?


467
00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:48.444
The 3 of us were gonna go together.

468
00:24:48.819 --> 00:24:50.397
Why can't you be happy for her?

469
00:24:50.717 --> 00:24:52.671
Yeah. I'd be happy for you if
someone you liked asked you.


470
00:24:52.771 --> 00:24:54.748
A minute ago you liked James.

471
00:24:54.967 --> 00:24:56.362
I don't know if I would
like him in real life.


472
00:24:56.363 --> 00:24:57.534
You know, I've never met him.

473
00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:01.008
- Ketchup?
- Oh yeah. Thank you.


474
00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:05.809
Ketchup?

475
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.659
You wanna know about Scott?

476
00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:12.631
Charlie told him about
some stuff he and I did.


477
00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:14.435
And you know what Scott did?

478
00:25:16.045 --> 00:25:17.574
He laughed.

479
00:25:19.313 --> 00:25:21.432
You're gonna get hurt Taylor.

480
00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:25.740
I mean just 'cause you got
dumped doesn't mean I will.


481
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:30.218
Thanks.

482
00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:39.573
Guess what!

483
00:25:39.876 --> 00:25:41.035
Guess what guess what!

484
00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:42.751
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!


485
00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:45.840
Your father called?

486
00:25:46.504 --> 00:25:48.361
Uh no.

487
00:25:48.752 --> 00:25:50.073
Sorry, bad question.

488
00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:51.947
Why are you so excited?

489
00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:55.070
Scott Ozsik asked me to
the spring fling.


490
00:25:55.479 --> 00:25:57.150
That's wonderful sweetheart.

491
00:25:57.213 --> 00:25:58.519
So can I have my laptop back now?

492
00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:01.071
Okay fine.

493
00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:15.385
What are you guys doing here?

494
00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:17.124
Cheyenne made me drive her.

495
00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:20.043
You haven't seen it yet?

496
00:26:20.743 --> 00:26:22.842
- No. What?
- Your wall.


497
00:26:22.942 --> 00:26:26.474
No I just got my computer back.
What did Lindsay post more stuff?


498
00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:28.303
Um not Lindsay.

499
00:26:28.615 --> 00:26:31.247
That James guy you thought was so nice.

500
00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:37.648
He's saying he slept with you...

501
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:39.793
That you gave him an STD.

502
00:26:51.707 --> 00:26:54.896
No big surprise, she's nasty!

503
00:26:56.783 --> 00:26:57.554
Can smell clap on her

504
00:26:57.654 --> 00:27:00.058
bet you big money, she has herpes too.

505
00:27:00.158 --> 00:27:01.887
No wonder she reeks.

506
00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:03.951
She's always made me want to throw up.

507
00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:12.501
She's a loser.

508
00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:15.031
I sit behind you in algebra.
You smell weird.


509
00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:16.315
- The clap.
- Skanky whore.


510
00:27:16.415 --> 00:27:19.178
Gross! Don't breathe
around her.


511
00:27:19.217 --> 00:27:20.827
You'll get infected.

512
00:27:25.335 --> 00:27:26.320
I don't get it

513
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.797
God why would he say that he slept
with me or got an STD from me?


514
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.107
I never even met him!

515
00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:34.626
I'm so sorry.

516
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.354
I knew it.

517
00:27:40.374 --> 00:27:43.518
I told my cousin to look at James's
profile and see if she recognized him.


518
00:27:43.609 --> 00:27:45.437
She says there's no such guy at ridgeway.

519
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:47.124
Maybe she's just never met him.

520
00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:48.569
There's 300 people in
that entire school.


521
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:50.551
She'd recognize him if he went there.

522
00:27:50.645 --> 00:27:51.758
What so he's fake?

523
00:27:51.858 --> 00:27:55.739
Well he's full of crap
so yeah he's fake.


524
00:27:55.903 --> 00:27:58.903
I bet you 100 bucks someone
just put up that fake profile.


525
00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:00.114
Oh Lindsay!

526
00:28:00.214 --> 00:28:02.158
Yeah Lindsay would totally
do something like that.


527
00:28:03.046 --> 00:28:05.296
Oh God! All the stuff
that I told him.


528
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:07.571
I told him my
dad cheated on my mom!

529
00:28:07.688 --> 00:28:10.019
Like all kinds of personal stuff.

530
00:28:12.078 --> 00:28:14.167
What if he posts it?

531
00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:17.720
Almost dinner.
Time to go soon girls okay?


532
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.014
Thanks.

533
00:28:24.372 --> 00:28:27.050
No. No I'm not gonna tell her.

534
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.809
No I just got my laptop back.

535
00:28:35.116 --> 00:28:36.322
Wanna try?

536
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:41.650
No, I might look slutty.

537
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.989
Is that why you're wearing
all those baggy clothes?


538
00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:51.172
Did you see what people were
saying about me last night?


539
00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.742
Taylor, you're not even in the
neighbourhood of being a slut,


540
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.516
and your status says that
you never slept with James.


541
00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:58.375
I don't understand what I did wrong.

542
00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:04.081
Should've brought the disinfectant.

543
00:29:04.186 --> 00:29:07.327
Don't wanna use these sinks
after the skank patrol.


544
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.378
Sick.

545
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:17.111
Calling me a skank now too?

546
00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:18.041
Yeah I know. It sucks.

547
00:29:18.095 --> 00:29:20.241
I've never been called
a name at school, ever.


548
00:29:20.334 --> 00:29:21.858
Well you know what they say, sticks
and stones may break a bone...


549
00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:25.147
Don't you dare make a joke
about this. Don't you dare!


550
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:28.000
Just stop following me okay?

551
00:29:29.104 --> 00:29:31.072
She blames me for what Lindsay said?

552
00:29:31.174 --> 00:29:32.578
I'll go talk to her.

553
00:29:45.643 --> 00:29:46.834
Scott, hey.

554
00:29:48.225 --> 00:29:49.123
Hey what's up?

555
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.769
Uh nothing.

556
00:29:51.838 --> 00:29:55.935
Look, I know that a lot of people
are saying stuff about me online.


557
00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:57.904
This stuff's totally not true

558
00:29:58.131 --> 00:29:59.484
and I guess I just
want to make sure...


559
00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:00.857
It's not a big deal.

560
00:30:01.044 --> 00:30:02.343
Well it kind of is...

561
00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:06.741
It's really gross stuff and...

562
00:30:06.841 --> 00:30:10.009
Look, I haven't slept with
anybody or anything and...


563
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:12.898
I'll see you in history.

564
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:29.790
You can come in you know.

565
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.139
Just let me ask you one thing.

566
00:31:33.748 --> 00:31:35.737
Are you still my friend?

567
00:31:37.441 --> 00:31:39.074
Yeah I guess.

568
00:31:39.129 --> 00:31:41.449
What does that mean, you're my friend
everywhere except school?


569
00:31:41.684 --> 00:31:43.145
Look, I don't know what you expect.

570
00:31:43.293 --> 00:31:44.839
None of this is my fault.

571
00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:46.372
Well Samantha's standing by me.
Why can't you?


572
00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:49.355
Why can't you not flirt
with people you don't know?


573
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.720
You didn't have to
talk to that James guy.

574
00:31:53.283 --> 00:31:55.053
You think all this is my fault?

575
00:31:55.153 --> 00:31:57.970
You called Lindsay a bitch online.

576
00:31:58.126 --> 00:32:00.135
Of course she was gonna
come after you.


577
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:15.617
I made spaghetti for dinner
if you'd like some.


578
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.747
Hello.

579
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.777
Hi Kris? This is Darren
mortenson Cheyenne's father.


580
00:32:26.877 --> 00:32:28.958
Oh hi Darren.
How have you been?


581
00:32:29.192 --> 00:32:30.470
Kris I don't know...

582
00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:33.709
Are you aware of what's
been happening with Taylor?


583
00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.018
Show me your clicksters page now!

584
00:32:59.518 --> 00:33:01.640
Why didn't you shut this down
when I asked you to?


585
00:33:02.268 --> 00:33:04.673
And why would you subject
yourself to this?


586
00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:08.851
Shut it down Taylor.
You have no choice anymore.


587
00:33:14.828 --> 00:33:17.237
Oh look mom!
A new comment!


588
00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:19.346
I'm so popular!

589
00:33:19.495 --> 00:33:21.914
No this one's from lindsayluv.
She's my favourite.


590
00:33:22.258 --> 00:33:23.812
Yeah she says that James told her

591
00:33:23.906 --> 00:33:26.802
I took all my
clothes off for 5 bucks.

592
00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:29.125
Did you change your mind
about going to school?


593
00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:31.021
You said I could have one
day to stay home.


594
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.693
I just don't want you to get in the
habit of avoiding your problems.


595
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:38.637
Sometimes the best thing is to face
things head on, don't you think?


596
00:34:38.897 --> 00:34:40.441
Maybe you should just
walk into your school


597
00:34:40.442 --> 00:34:42.398
with your head high and tell
those kids they shouldn't


598
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:43.999
believe everything they
see on the Internet.


599
00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:46.073
That's gonna be a big help.

600
00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:53.473
I'm gonna stop by your school
and talk to your principal.


601
00:34:53.573 --> 00:34:54.214
Great.

602
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:14.634
Hi you've reached Brett.

603
00:35:14.735 --> 00:35:16.212
I can't get to the phone right now.

604
00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:17.743
Please leave a message.

605
00:35:19.548 --> 00:35:21.892
Hey dad. It's me, Taylor.

606
00:35:24.314 --> 00:35:25.999
I know you probably
didn't pick up because


607
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.082
you think I'm still
mad at you but um...


608
00:35:29.947 --> 00:35:33.291
Okay, I take back what I said about
never wanting to speak to you again.


609
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.389
Uh... You...

610
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.425
I just feel so alone right now

611
00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:44.744
and I don't know if you
care or not but um...


612
00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:51.529
Just call me back.

613
00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:57.506
You're preaching to the choir.

614
00:35:57.706 --> 00:36:00.058
I know bullying over
the Internet is a problem.


615
00:36:00.167 --> 00:36:01.980
It's given me a headache.

616
00:36:02.144 --> 00:36:03.857
I still can't figure out
what to do about it.


617
00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:07.263
Well why wouldn't you treat a
cyberbully like any other bully?


618
00:36:07.388 --> 00:36:08.265
Well I can't control
the Internet


619
00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.092
or what students do on their
own computers at home.


620
00:36:12.434 --> 00:36:14.553
And this kind of bullying,

621
00:36:14.702 --> 00:36:18.256
well it happens using
anonymous user names.


622
00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:20.960
You can't tell who's who
and who started what.


623
00:36:21.912 --> 00:36:24.389
But the kids know who's who.
They can tell you.


624
00:36:24.475 --> 00:36:27.412
Well maybe but unless
I can get the school board


625
00:36:27.491 --> 00:36:30.647
to give me some guidelines that
allows me to compel them to do so...


626
00:36:30.747 --> 00:36:33.054
Well you must have some
kind of policy.


627
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.831
A vague one, created by
insurance companies


628
00:36:35.832 --> 00:36:38.655
to protect the school
from liability.


629
00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:41.030
Half the time I don't know
where I stand legally.


630
00:36:41.686 --> 00:36:44.318
I keep asking the school board
to give me some policies


631
00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:47.103
that has some teeth that I can use
to bite down on these kids but...


632
00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:03.615
Hey.

633
00:37:06.453 --> 00:37:10.051
Look I promised my mom I wouldn't
go on clicksters on my computer.


634
00:37:11.033 --> 00:37:12.662
Can I use yours?

635
00:37:13.445 --> 00:37:14.754
Sure.

636
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:31.165
Now they're saying I missed
school because I'm pregnant


637
00:37:31.227 --> 00:37:33.657
and I'm some kind of prostitute.

638
00:37:33.844 --> 00:37:34.505
Nobody believes that stuff.

639
00:37:34.506 --> 00:37:37.665
Maybe Cheyenne was right.
I was asking for it.


640
00:37:37.782 --> 00:37:39.134
Cheyenne's stupid.

641
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.071
No I told all that personal
stuff to James.


642
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.725
Ha! I didn't even know him.

643
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:47.878
Taylor this is really hard...

644
00:37:47.903 --> 00:37:50.264
You know, Scott reads that stuff.

645
00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:54.333
I mean what if he believes it?
What if he thinks I'm pregnant?


646
00:37:54.433 --> 00:37:56.477
Wait that's what you're
worried about right now, Scott?


647
00:37:56.563 --> 00:37:58.673
Yeah! Yeah, I'm worried about Scott.

648
00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:02.376
Who cares what he thinks Taylor?

649
00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:04.634
Where has Scott been?
Nowhere!


650
00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:07.828
You even said yourself,
he's been ignoring you!


651
00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:09.695
Now all of a sudden you
care what he thinks?


652
00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:11.031
Hey stop yelling at me!

653
00:38:11.316 --> 00:38:13.500
I can't take it
if you're against me too.

654
00:38:18.175 --> 00:38:19.329
I'm sorry.

655
00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:29.373
I'm so sorry Taylor.

656
00:38:33.804 --> 00:38:35.193
None of this should've happened.

657
00:38:46.686 --> 00:38:48.774
Maybe we should forget school today.

658
00:38:49.204 --> 00:38:51.299
You wanna ditch?
I'll ditch with you?


659
00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.229
No I wanna talk to Scott.

660
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.424
Of course.

661
00:38:58.099 --> 00:39:00.682
Look, you should just get Scott
to give you a ride home too.


662
00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:02.174
Because I'm done trying to
be your friend.


663
00:39:02.961 --> 00:39:04.525
Have a nice life Taylor.

664
00:39:42.722 --> 00:39:43.661
Hey Scott.

665
00:39:45.286 --> 00:39:46.306
Hey.

666
00:39:47.759 --> 00:39:49.570
Hey I know I haven't
talked to you in a while.


667
00:39:50.438 --> 00:39:52.961
Um I was just wondering, if we were
still going to the dance tonight?


668
00:39:54.755 --> 00:39:58.023
Um listen Taylor.

669
00:39:58.822 --> 00:40:02.401
My mom pissed me off last night and
said I have to go with Marnie Fox.


670
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:05.425
Her mom's best friends with
my mom and...


671
00:40:06.302 --> 00:40:07.482
Yeah.

672
00:40:09.566 --> 00:40:11.634
So you're taking Marnie?

673
00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:14.158
I'm sorry. It's not exactly
my choice but...


674
00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:16.861
I don't know what else to do.

675
00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:19.977
Okay.

676
00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:23.462
Just...

677
00:40:38.308 --> 00:40:40.486
Oh! She's crying.

678
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:42.715
She must've seen the video.

679
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:44.619
Everyone's seen it.

680
00:40:44.804 --> 00:40:46.608
500 views last time I checked.

681
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:48.252
You guys have all seen it right?

682
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.070
Isn't it hysterical?

683
00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.749
What video?

684
00:40:59.805 --> 00:41:01.964
Just wait till you see it.

685
00:42:20.656 --> 00:42:23.699
I'm Taylor Hillridge.
Wanna have a good time?


686
00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:25.725
5 bucks all it takes!

687
00:42:27.332 --> 00:42:29.296
You smell like a bit of a sewer.

688
00:42:29.396 --> 00:42:30.770
You ever take shower?

689
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.357
How about 2 bucks...
Or $1? 50 cents?


690
00:42:35.457 --> 00:42:38.382
How about I pay you to show
me a good time?


691
00:42:38.507 --> 00:42:40.022
Ew! Gross!

692
00:42:40.093 --> 00:42:42.998
I act like I'm the most holy
and pure thing at school.


693
00:42:43.098 --> 00:42:48.380
But I'm really the dirtiest
little whore.


694
00:44:11.713 --> 00:44:13.260
I'm the real Taylor Hillridge...

695
00:44:50.355 --> 00:44:52.634
I'm the real Taylor Hillridge.

696
00:44:56.783 --> 00:44:59.510
And I don't know why
everybody hates me so much!


697
00:45:01.009 --> 00:45:04.047
But maybe I do.

698
00:45:04.777 --> 00:45:06.713
Because now I hate me too.

699
00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:09.729
And right now

700
00:45:10.373 --> 00:45:13.711
I really don't see the reason
for trying...


701
00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.205
...or for talking,

702
00:45:18.698 --> 00:45:20.607
or for breathing.

703
00:45:21.994 --> 00:45:23.465
I'm just done.

704
00:45:29.012 --> 00:45:30.877
So that's it I guess.

705
00:45:33.899 --> 00:45:34.858
Bye.

706
00:45:43.344 --> 00:45:44.875
Pick up the phone Taylor.

707
00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:52.552
Pick up the phone Taylor!

708
00:45:53.773 --> 00:45:54.798
Taylor?

709
00:45:58.364 --> 00:45:59.164
This is Kris.

710
00:45:59.264 --> 00:46:01.622
It's Samantha, I think there's
something's wrong with Taylor.


711
00:46:01.722 --> 00:46:04.595
She posted a video online and
now she's not answering the phone.


712
00:46:04.857 --> 00:46:06.264
And I'm really freaking out.

713
00:46:06.318 --> 00:46:08.168
Samantha, slow down.
I can't understand you.


714
00:46:08.268 --> 00:46:10.242
I think she's trying to kill herself.

715
00:46:10.342 --> 00:46:11.656
Oh my God!

716
00:46:11.806 --> 00:46:13.185
Oh my God!

717
00:46:19.664 --> 00:46:20.535
Taylor?

718
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.269
Taylor?

719
00:46:23.669 --> 00:46:24.908
Where's Taylor?

720
00:46:25.008 --> 00:46:26.757
How should I know?
I'm grounded.


721
00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:28.366
Taylor?

722
00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:32.074
Taylor? Taylor!

723
00:46:34.182 --> 00:46:35.042
Taylor?

724
00:46:47.884 --> 00:46:48.814
Taylor?

725
00:46:52.801 --> 00:46:54.915
I can't get the cap off!

726
00:46:55.015 --> 00:46:55.510
No!

727
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:57.189
Give it to me!
Give it to me!


728
00:46:59.527 --> 00:47:00.427
Taylor?

729
00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.385
Taylor, let go!

730
00:47:06.773 --> 00:47:08.082
What did you do?

731
00:47:08.182 --> 00:47:10.280
Sit down, sit down,
sit down. Back up.


732
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.870
It's okay.

733
00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.677
I got you.

734
00:47:18.186 --> 00:47:19.745
Baby it's okay.

735
00:47:22.453 --> 00:47:23.652
Please.

736
00:47:23.752 --> 00:47:26.920
I wanna die. No!

737
00:47:29.049 --> 00:47:31.008
I wanna die!

738
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.375
You're awake. You okay?

739
00:48:03.648 --> 00:48:06.726
Yeah. I feel funny.

740
00:48:08.415 --> 00:48:09.547
I'm sleepy.

741
00:48:09.765 --> 00:48:12.173
That's the sedative.
It's starting to wear off.


742
00:48:18.449 --> 00:48:19.679
Hey Sammi.

743
00:48:20.948 --> 00:48:22.077
I'm okay.

744
00:48:30.162 --> 00:48:32.681
I don't understand how this happened.

745
00:48:32.781 --> 00:48:35.329
Did she tell you she was so depressed?

746
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:37.843
Uh I don't know. Maybe.

747
00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:41.742
Did this happen because some
James kid turned on her?


748
00:48:42.696 --> 00:48:44.053
Do you know who he is?

749
00:48:46.772 --> 00:48:49.281
Taylor found out that he wasn't real.

750
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.939
What does that mean?

751
00:48:53.945 --> 00:48:56.926
Someone posed as James to torture her?

752
00:48:58.105 --> 00:49:00.961
Um look I gotta go.

753
00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:03.078
My mom's gonna be worried.

754
00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:05.960
Just have Taylor call me whenever.

755
00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:29.121
I've talked to Taylor and
I'd like to keep her overnight.


756
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:30.895
Make sure she's stable.

757
00:49:30.995 --> 00:49:32.376
You can take her
home in the morning


758
00:49:32.377 --> 00:49:34.401
but you'll have to keep
a sharp eye on her.


759
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.534
I'm keeping her out of
school for the next week.


760
00:49:36.635 --> 00:49:37.591
And I'm taking a week off of work.

761
00:49:37.979 --> 00:49:41.359
Good. If she starts talking about
harming herself again, call me.


762
00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:46.211
This is an appointment card for her
next one-one-one session with me


763
00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:50.099
and this is a teen support
group I run.


764
00:49:50.534 --> 00:49:51.678
It's twice a week.

765
00:49:51.854 --> 00:49:55.495
We talk about assertiveness,
bullying, other things.


766
00:49:55.595 --> 00:49:56.990
I think it might help her,

767
00:49:57.089 --> 00:50:01.846
and finally, I switch in
for a mild tranquilizer.


768
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:05.362
One tablet every 6 hours
for the next few days


769
00:50:05.526 --> 00:50:07.303
or until you feel her mood
has evened out.


770
00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:09.917
It'll make her want to sleep
but that's a good thing.


771
00:50:10.017 --> 00:50:12.840
I'm doing such a
great job on my own.

772
00:50:14.169 --> 00:50:16.428
Taylor mentioned you were divorced.

773
00:50:16.528 --> 00:50:20.612
I'm sure that's a factor
but being bullied online.


774
00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.643
That can push a kid over the edge.

775
00:50:22.784 --> 00:50:24.815
It's like a group assault very traumatic.

776
00:50:25.049 --> 00:50:27.010
Anyone with a computer can see it.

777
00:50:27.213 --> 00:50:29.150
It's always there 24/7.

778
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.260
Makes the victim feel even more trapped.

779
00:50:32.495 --> 00:50:33.937
Unable to escape from it.

780
00:50:38.734 --> 00:50:40.613
I almost lost her.

781
00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.805
Check in on Taylor every 10 minutes,

782
00:51:03.824 --> 00:51:06.109
and call me if she wakes up.

783
00:51:06.226 --> 00:51:06.807
Okay.

784
00:51:08.409 --> 00:51:09.938
Eric, I'm serious.

785
00:51:10.086 --> 00:51:13.117
I didn't un-ground you, so that you
could play video games all day.


786
00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:14.687
You have to keep an eye on
your sister.


787
00:51:14.695 --> 00:51:16.746
Mom, I don't want it to happen
to her either.


788
00:51:16.846 --> 00:51:19.555
Thank you. Look,
I'll be back in an hour.


789
00:51:19.734 --> 00:51:22.187
Oh and your dad might call.
He left a message on Taylor's cell.


790
00:51:22.219 --> 00:51:25.031
Just don't say anything.

791
00:51:25.219 --> 00:51:26.760
I haven't figured out
what I'm gonna tell him.


792
00:51:27.023 --> 00:51:27.961
Okay.

793
00:51:28.534 --> 00:51:29.983
Where are you going?

794
00:51:30.756 --> 00:51:33.144
I'm gonna find out who that James is.

795
00:51:51.266 --> 00:51:53.089
You're such an ass Scott.

796
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:55.198
Such an ass.

797
00:52:02.729 --> 00:52:04.452
Thank you for letting me come over.

798
00:52:05.385 --> 00:52:08.611
I'm really sorry Taylor's
having such a hard time.


799
00:52:08.627 --> 00:52:10.664
You know the way they're
all ganging up on her.


800
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.477
It's pretty rough stuff.

801
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:14.766
It's gone.

802
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.553
James's profile, it was here
yesterday and now it's deleted.


803
00:52:19.753 --> 00:52:22.369
I should've printed it out
when I had the chance.


804
00:52:26.102 --> 00:52:27.811
Does Taylor hate me?

805
00:52:29.537 --> 00:52:31.676
Of course not Cheyenne.

806
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:38.172
Do you think that this James
person could be a fake?


807
00:52:39.785 --> 00:52:42.958
Well his profile says that he
goes to ridgeway and he doesn't.


808
00:52:43.065 --> 00:52:45.322
Do you have any idea who
could've created this profile?


809
00:53:01.062 --> 00:53:01.947
Can I help you?

810
00:53:02.047 --> 00:53:03.359
Uh Mr. Fordyce.

811
00:53:03.897 --> 00:53:04.656
Lindsay's father?

812
00:53:04.788 --> 00:53:06.499
Yes I am.
What's this about?


813
00:53:06.874 --> 00:53:08.424
Well your daughter and my daughter,
they go to school together


814
00:53:08.523 --> 00:53:10.866
and I was wondering if I could
speak to you and your wife


815
00:53:10.889 --> 00:53:12.530
about some things that have
been happening.


816
00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.748
My wife passed away a few years ago,

817
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:16.334
so you'll have to deal with me.

818
00:53:16.974 --> 00:53:17.984
I heard my name.

819
00:53:19.087 --> 00:53:21.608
I'm Taylor's mother and
I was just wondering


820
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.342
if you created a fake profile online?

821
00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:27.170
- What? No!
- Lindsay, go back inside.


822
00:53:27.256 --> 00:53:30.100
You and your friends have been
harassing my daughter for weeks now.


823
00:53:30.881 --> 00:53:32.256
My daughter tried
to commit suicide


824
00:53:32.257 --> 00:53:34.491
because your daughter
was bullying her.


825
00:53:34.748 --> 00:53:37.100
You should know you're
speaking with an attorney,


826
00:53:37.194 --> 00:53:39.014
before you slander my daughter.

827
00:53:39.045 --> 00:53:40.116
It's not slander.
It's fact.


828
00:53:40.178 --> 00:53:42.978
I have posts from lindsayluv
your daughter mocking Taylor.


829
00:53:43.577 --> 00:53:46.928
If my daughter expressed
her opinion about anything...


830
00:53:47.006 --> 00:53:48.545
Demeaning insulting opinions.

831
00:53:48.639 --> 00:53:51.873
That's her right, at least according
to the constitution.


832
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:55.131
Excuse me? You're going
to defend her?


833
00:53:55.334 --> 00:53:57.149
It's called freedom of speech.

834
00:53:57.615 --> 00:53:59.069
It's the first amendment.

835
00:53:59.233 --> 00:54:00.632
You might want to give it a read.

836
00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:21.625
Why are you staring at me?

837
00:54:22.595 --> 00:54:24.430
Mom said I have to call her
when you wake up.


838
00:54:24.641 --> 00:54:27.368
No you don't have to call her.

839
00:54:28.402 --> 00:54:30.711
But you do have to get me
that water over there.


840
00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.053
Were you really gonna do it?

841
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:03.886
I would've been mad if you did.

842
00:55:06.866 --> 00:55:09.090
No you would've loved being
an only child.


843
00:55:09.178 --> 00:55:10.150
No I wouldn't!

844
00:55:10.999 --> 00:55:13.278
If you hadn't put that video up

845
00:55:13.378 --> 00:55:15.663
I could've been the one
finding you all...


846
00:55:16.381 --> 00:55:18.125
dead in the bathroom you know?

847
00:55:18.225 --> 00:55:20.843
God I bet they're saying
all kinds of things about me.


848
00:55:21.138 --> 00:55:23.787
Eric go get the laptop. I have
to see what they're saying.


849
00:55:25.101 --> 00:55:26.850
Fine I'll get it.

850
00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.038
No it's fine. I
got it I got it.

851
00:55:59.197 --> 00:56:01.356
Do you really think that's
a good idea?


852
00:56:28.913 --> 00:56:30.298
I don't know why you're
making me do this.


853
00:56:30.348 --> 00:56:31.848
This isn't a punishment Taylor.

854
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.037
It's a support group
a place to help you


855
00:56:33.038 --> 00:56:35.293
talk about what
you've been through.


856
00:56:35.293 --> 00:56:36.183
I don't want to talk about it.

857
00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:38.645
Then don't talk about it.
Just go and listen.


858
00:56:40.379 --> 00:56:41.340
We can't pretend that this
didn't happen!


859
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.670
It happened and you need help!

860
00:56:43.803 --> 00:56:46.022
And there's nothing wrong
with asking for help!


861
00:56:50.196 --> 00:56:53.264
It's really hard to see you
in this much pain.


862
00:56:54.725 --> 00:56:57.963
And I am scared that you're
gonna try this again!


863
00:57:00.339 --> 00:57:02.003
You've put so much into your life.

864
00:57:02.084 --> 00:57:04.061
Your life is so precious.

865
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.759
Please.

866
00:57:14.232 --> 00:57:15.461
Fine. Okay I'm going.

867
00:57:43.547 --> 00:57:46.081
Before we had to stop unfortunately.

868
00:57:46.487 --> 00:57:48.534
We interrupted your story Kate,
then we're gonna talk...


869
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.799
Oh Taylor!

870
00:57:53.214 --> 00:57:54.290
Glad you could make it.

871
00:57:54.894 --> 00:57:56.073
Come, sit down.

872
00:58:10.062 --> 00:58:10.892
Uh...

873
00:58:13.108 --> 00:58:14.008
Okay.

874
00:58:15.336 --> 00:58:16.756
Awkward.

875
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:23.417
I've printed out what these kids
are saying to my daughter,


876
00:58:23.485 --> 00:58:26.758
they're calling her terrible names
and saying she has STDs.


877
00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:28.305
Has she been physically threatened?

878
00:58:28.407 --> 00:58:29.938
Physical threat I can do
something about.


879
00:58:30.032 --> 00:58:30.576
They're calling her dirty

880
00:58:30.577 --> 00:58:33.282
and saying that she's
sleeping with boys for money.


881
00:58:33.382 --> 00:58:36.869
- Isn't that harassment?
- If they said it to her face, yes.


882
00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:39.869
But online, there's no law
against that in this state.


883
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:41.528
Other States have laws
that are particular


884
00:58:41.529 --> 00:58:43.447
to the Internet
but not this one.


885
00:58:43.564 --> 00:58:45.150
But how can that be? I'm trying to
get help for my daughter.


886
00:58:45.158 --> 00:58:46.896
I've gone to the school,
I've gone to school board,


887
00:58:46.897 --> 00:58:49.971
and door after door keeps
getting slammed in my face.


888
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:51.119
It's not that I don't
want to help you,


889
00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:53.484
but unless a law is broken...

890
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.243
I can only enforce the laws,
I can't write them.


891
00:58:57.986 --> 00:58:59.745
In elementary school it was like:

892
00:58:59.846 --> 00:59:02.096
"hey there goes jelly donut"
you know stuff like that.


893
00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.757
And it sucked right?

894
00:59:05.728 --> 00:59:08.059
But at least I could go home
to get some peace.


895
00:59:08.892 --> 00:59:11.525
Now it's like I can't even post
pictures on my own profile


896
00:59:11.572 --> 00:59:12.538
'cause people are gonna be telling me

897
00:59:12.638 --> 00:59:17.736
how fat or disgusting I am.

898
00:59:18.575 --> 00:59:20.704
This stuff follows me home.

899
00:59:22.866 --> 00:59:24.095
I hate that.

900
00:59:26.454 --> 00:59:31.103
But the worst is when people
resend stuff you said to them.


901
00:59:36.032 --> 00:59:38.291
There was this guy I liked.

902
00:59:39.924 --> 00:59:41.454
I thought he liked me.

903
00:59:43.436 --> 00:59:45.275
He really didn't.

904
00:59:46.542 --> 00:59:51.989
But I told him personal stuff and...

905
00:59:53.512 --> 00:59:55.641
and he sent it
to a bunch of people.

906
00:59:56.506 --> 00:59:58.935
And now at school there's
this bunch of guys,


907
00:59:58.986 --> 01:00:03.494
they act out the stuff I said
right in front of me.


908
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.558
They call it the gay-boy show.

909
01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.367
No wait. That's not the worst.

910
01:00:14.493 --> 01:00:18.533
You were right. The worst is
when it goes home with you


911
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.392
and they pile on and pile on,

912
01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:24.025
and you think: "I don't even
know who that person is.


913
01:00:24.189 --> 01:00:26.588
"How can he say that he
despises that I exist?"


914
01:00:31.306 --> 01:00:33.020
Caleb, I'm really sorry.

915
01:00:33.384 --> 01:00:35.361
That you told me people
were picking on you


916
01:00:35.447 --> 01:00:37.580
and I didn't say anything
and I'm really sorry.


917
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:43.252
You should post crap about
those guys too.


918
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.495
You know that's what I'd do.

919
01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:49.650
It's not about getting mad.
It's getting even.


920
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.549
Well that's one option,
become the bully yourself.


921
01:00:53.377 --> 01:00:56.947
Right, how many of you have ever
decided to get even?


922
01:00:57.478 --> 01:00:58.908
Posted mean comments
online about


923
01:00:59.017 --> 01:01:01.517
someone you felt was
being mean to you?


924
01:01:08.066 --> 01:01:09.146
No one else?

925
01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:12.642
You never called someone
a name online,


926
01:01:12.675 --> 01:01:16.345
or said they were stupid or ugly?

927
01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:25.517
I called Lindsay Fordyce a bitch.

928
01:01:38.258 --> 01:01:39.357
Thank you.

929
01:01:46.017 --> 01:01:48.064
- Scott!
- Hey.


930
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:51.002
You must be feeling really
happy with yourself.


931
01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:53.994
Is your ego all puffed up
and feeling good?


932
01:01:55.196 --> 01:01:56.113
Excuse me?

933
01:01:56.494 --> 01:01:58.017
I'm Taylor's best friend.

934
01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:01.213
I was sitting there when you
invited her to the spring fling.


935
01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:03.814
So you're gonna blame me because she
had some sort of mondo meltdown?


936
01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.994
Like you even care about her?!

937
01:02:07.734 --> 01:02:09.373
Wait. Wait.

938
01:02:11.554 --> 01:02:12.653
So, she's doing okay?

939
01:02:12.822 --> 01:02:15.447
- Give me a break Scott!
- I'm serious. I wanna know.


940
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.591
I actually really did like her.

941
01:02:18.345 --> 01:02:20.681
- Right.
- You don't give a crap do you?


942
01:02:21.345 --> 01:02:23.237
You just think I'm an ass which...

943
01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:26.009
...Is probably true.

944
01:02:27.306 --> 01:02:28.775
So why don't you tell me huh?

945
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.728
What's it like to be
so perfect that you


946
01:02:30.752 --> 01:02:32.674
don't have to feel
bad about anything?


947
01:02:43.198 --> 01:02:45.276
- Yeah, I got your message.
- Oh that's good.


948
01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:47.987
I saved the one where
you said you started


949
01:02:48.042 --> 01:02:50.456
to call like 50 times
on my birthday.


950
01:02:50.627 --> 01:02:51.971
I should've just called.

951
01:02:52.245 --> 01:02:53.645
You know I care about you a lot.

952
01:02:53.646 --> 01:02:53.995
Yeah.

953
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:56.025
Yeah I know you care.

954
01:02:56.117 --> 01:02:57.941
I do, really.

955
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:02.166
Well I'll see you
in a few weeks then.

956
01:03:02.395 --> 01:03:03.724
Okay honey.

957
01:03:04.137 --> 01:03:06.326
Okay. Hey, dad wait.

958
01:03:08.749 --> 01:03:10.103
Thanks for calling.

959
01:03:10.172 --> 01:03:11.556
I'm really glad I did.

960
01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:13.644
- Bye.
- Bye.


961
01:03:27.479 --> 01:03:28.670
Here's your pill.

962
01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:30.625
Do I have to take it?

963
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:31.635
You don't want it?

964
01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:35.609
I don't know. They make me so sleepy.
I kind of want to wake up.


965
01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.597
Dr. Rilke said you can stop
when you feel better.


966
01:03:41.394 --> 01:03:43.353
You've been so nice to me.

967
01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:46.299
I never used to think you were nice.

968
01:03:46.641 --> 01:03:47.306
What?

969
01:03:47.471 --> 01:03:50.495
I don't know. I guess I just
always thought


970
01:03:50.534 --> 01:03:54.010
you were so strict and
overprotective and mean.


971
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:57.213
And here I thought you adored me.

972
01:03:57.627 --> 01:03:58.823
Well that too.

973
01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.934
You're in a funny mood.

974
01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:08.862
I don't know. I just
felt so alone you know?


975
01:04:09.823 --> 01:04:10.916
When all those people
started saying


976
01:04:10.925 --> 01:04:13.370
stuff about me I felt
like such a freak.


977
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.471
Like I was the only one.

978
01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.979
Like there had to be something
wrong with me for them to do that.


979
01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:23.409
But today I found out this
happens to a lot of people.


980
01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:26.252
Like these really normal people.

981
01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:30.353
I don't know. I wish I'd known that.

982
01:04:31.878 --> 01:04:34.416
I wish I'd known you weren't
against me.


983
01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:36.895
Oh Taylor!

984
01:04:40.299 --> 01:04:41.557
I should've talked to you.
I don't know why I didn't.


985
01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.776
I'm sorry. I should've talked to you.

986
01:04:43.787 --> 01:04:46.307
I made it hard to talk to me.

987
01:04:47.198 --> 01:04:48.199
I was so busy telling
you what to do


988
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.268
that I wasn't listening
to how you felt.


989
01:04:51.877 --> 01:04:54.659
I'm sorry you thought
that I was against you.


990
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.698
I would never be against you.

991
01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:58.127
I know.

992
01:04:59.782 --> 01:05:02.612
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.


993
01:05:05.679 --> 01:05:07.308
I'm glad I'm not dead.

994
01:05:10.098 --> 01:05:11.347
Me too.

995
01:05:14.196 --> 01:05:15.233
Was that my phone?

996
01:05:15.303 --> 01:05:16.407
Oh it's in my purse.

997
01:05:23.665 --> 01:05:25.214
Oh it's Samantha.

998
01:05:25.437 --> 01:05:26.666
Okay.

999
01:05:28.113 --> 01:05:29.212
Thanks.

1000
01:05:42.866 --> 01:05:43.795
Hey!

1001
01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:46.292
Come inside.

1002
01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:49.268
I can't.

1003
01:05:50.267 --> 01:05:51.466
Why not?

1004
01:05:52.798 --> 01:05:55.176
Because you're gonna hate me
after I tell you this.


1005
01:05:57.112 --> 01:05:58.691
You're scaring me.

1006
01:05:59.525 --> 01:06:02.133
I don't know how to tell you
this, so I'm just gonna say it.


1007
01:06:05.088 --> 01:06:07.946
I'm the one who created
the James profile...


1008
01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:11.530
I pretended to be him.
I talked to you,


1009
01:06:12.346 --> 01:06:14.974
told everybody you gave him an STD.

1010
01:06:19.326 --> 01:06:21.005
I know you're lying.

1011
01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:24.746
You wouldn't do that.

1012
01:06:24.955 --> 01:06:25.705
I did.

1013
01:06:27.869 --> 01:06:30.158
I really wish I hadn't but I did.

1014
01:06:32.539 --> 01:06:33.818
I'm sorry.

1015
01:06:35.564 --> 01:06:37.292
I'm really sorry Taylor.

1016
01:07:30.477 --> 01:07:31.906
Samantha?

1017
01:07:32.158 --> 01:07:33.997
What is it? What's going on?

1018
01:07:34.389 --> 01:07:37.594
I did something really bad mom.

1019
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.035
and worse...

1020
01:07:43.023 --> 01:07:44.953
Now everybody knows.

1021
01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:52.902
Yeah I mean I guess I'm feeling better
but I haven't been going to school


1022
01:07:53.419 --> 01:07:54.777
and I know I'll eventually have
to go back and face everyone


1023
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.201
and that scares me.

1024
01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:00.111
Hey if I can do
it you can do it.

1025
01:08:00.146 --> 01:08:01.482
But I feel like I can't go
back until I go online


1026
01:08:01.497 --> 01:08:04.154
and I don't know
if I can handle that.

1027
01:08:04.535 --> 01:08:06.484
I think it's gonna be bad.

1028
01:08:07.693 --> 01:08:09.522
It's okay.

1029
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:16.693
Hon...it is gonna get better, okay?

1030
01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:24.572
I'm fine. Thank you.

1031
01:08:24.586 --> 01:08:25.669
Okay.

1032
01:08:54.013 --> 01:08:56.599
Odd this seems like a good time to
talk about how to handle it.


1033
01:08:56.771 --> 01:09:00.661
When you run into unpleasant
comments about you online.


1034
01:09:00.732 --> 01:09:04.302
You mean besides getting
even going all bully on them?


1035
01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:06.810
Which only adds fuel to the
fire makes everything worse.


1036
01:09:30.452 --> 01:09:33.670
I don't know what to do when I read
that stuff. I just fall apart.


1037
01:09:33.986 --> 01:09:36.319
It's fine to fall apart
for a little while.


1038
01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.343
It's fine to acknowledge
that it hurts.


1039
01:09:38.861 --> 01:09:41.624
But there are things that you
can do that you should do.


1040
01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:44.234
- Like print out everything?
- Yes.


1041
01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:47.265
You see something negative
about you print it out.


1042
01:09:47.335 --> 01:09:48.984
Save the evidence. What else?

1043
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:52.242
Block 'em. You know
block the sender.


1044
01:09:52.554 --> 01:09:56.437
You know you don't wanna see what
crap they're saying about you.


1045
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.929
Took me for damn ever to
figure that out.


1046
01:09:59.378 --> 01:10:01.042
God I never thought of that.

1047
01:10:11.304 --> 01:10:13.142
Now there's one more thing you can do.

1048
01:10:13.179 --> 01:10:15.179
Probably the most important thing.

1049
01:10:15.847 --> 01:10:16.596
Anyone?

1050
01:10:16.859 --> 01:10:19.296
Speak up man. Tell someone.

1051
01:10:19.364 --> 01:10:21.398
- Exactly.
- Tell who? Your mom?


1052
01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:24.382
I mean, my mom kind of knew although
I did kind of hide it from her.


1053
01:10:24.507 --> 01:10:27.117
Well sure start with your parents
but don't stop there.


1054
01:10:27.288 --> 01:10:31.523
Your favourite teacher,
your principal. I don't know.


1055
01:10:31.617 --> 01:10:34.447
You can also report it to the bully's
Internet service provider


1056
01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:36.179
sometimes they'll shut down
the bully's account.


1057
01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:37.221
You're kidding.

1058
01:10:37.506 --> 01:10:39.297
Cyberbullies keep
going because they


1059
01:10:39.298 --> 01:10:41.234
think no one will do
anything about it.


1060
01:10:41.796 --> 01:10:43.585
But if you call attention to it,

1061
01:10:43.945 --> 01:10:46.812
there's a chance you can stop it
from spiraling out of control.


1062
01:10:46.874 --> 01:10:50.405
- Yeah, but you can't totally stop it.
- Don't know unless you try.


1063
01:10:51.554 --> 01:10:53.513
Don't hide behind your fear.

1064
01:10:53.906 --> 01:10:55.898
Do what it takes to stand
up for yourself


1065
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:57.725
and for each other.

1066
01:11:03.382 --> 01:11:06.366
I've looked into it and most
States have passed laws


1067
01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:07.382
against harassment on the Internet.

1068
01:11:07.562 --> 01:11:10.367
Remember Tina Meier?
Her daughter committed suicide.


1069
01:11:10.515 --> 01:11:12.359
I remember that.
How tragic. Tragic.


1070
01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:14.413
After that Missouri passed a law.

1071
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.421
I mean, do we have to wait
for somebody to die first?


1072
01:11:16.788 --> 01:11:18.335
Couldn't you introduce a bill?

1073
01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:20.710
I don't want to try to
legislate the Internet.


1074
01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.881
I don't go online myself
if I can help it.

1075
01:11:22.969 --> 01:11:24.023
My staff does that for me.

1076
01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:26.281
But these kids are on
the Internet all the time


1077
01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.920
and they're vulnerable
to these bullies


1078
01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.617
that are hiding behind
anonymous usernames.


1079
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:32.173
Yes, but no one's making them
go online are they?


1080
01:11:32.903 --> 01:11:33.812
Excuse me?

1081
01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:34.866
Well, they do have delete
buttons on computers.


1082
01:11:34.873 --> 01:11:38.577
I thought that too until
I almost lost my daughter.


1083
01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:41.452
You can't keep these kids off
the Internet. It's their world.


1084
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:42.851
If you can't understand that.

1085
01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:44.536
Maybe somebody on your
staff who could help me.


1086
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.523
I can't allocate man-hours to that

1087
01:11:46.538 --> 01:11:47.976
in a middle of a budget wrangle.

1088
01:11:48.015 --> 01:11:49.914
Why don't you try me again next session?

1089
01:11:50.558 --> 01:11:52.267
Thanks so much for coming in.

1090
01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.404
Take the fries off...

1091
01:12:19.908 --> 01:12:20.958
You good?

1092
01:12:25.154 --> 01:12:27.683
I hope you don't think it's
weird that I came here.


1093
01:12:29.248 --> 01:12:30.857
I don't know if it is or not.

1094
01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.499
Why are you here? Because
if it's about the dance...


1095
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:34.921
No it's not about the dance.

1096
01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:38.213
Okay, well I'm sorry anyway
for ditching you like that.


1097
01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.968
It's okay. Thanks.

1098
01:12:42.138 --> 01:12:44.166
Look, I'm here because...

1099
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:47.640
I just wanna know if...

1100
01:12:50.002 --> 01:12:51.941
Did you see the video that I posted?

1101
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:56.248
Well yeah. Everyone saw it.

1102
01:12:56.265 --> 01:12:58.734
Yeah I just wanna make sure
you know that.


1103
01:12:58.835 --> 01:12:59.929
That was not because...

1104
01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.193
- Because of me?
- Yeah.


1105
01:13:03.498 --> 01:13:05.172
I mean yeah I thought that at first.

1106
01:13:05.194 --> 01:13:07.123
And it was like too much.

1107
01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.043
It freaked me out.

1108
01:13:08.085 --> 01:13:09.960
Oh my God! It was not
because of you.


1109
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:13.882
I know. Even my mom was like:
"dude check your ego.


1110
01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:15.492
"there's a lot more going on here."

1111
01:13:18.304 --> 01:13:20.872
Yeah. There was a lot going on.

1112
01:13:22.761 --> 01:13:25.290
All that crap coming down
on you online.


1113
01:13:25.827 --> 01:13:27.624
Yeah it was really bad.

1114
01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:32.429
I see that kind of thing happen all
the time and I never say anything,


1115
01:13:32.507 --> 01:13:34.780
and then I saw it happen to you
and it made me feel sick...


1116
01:13:35.002 --> 01:13:35.851
But...

1117
01:13:37.109 --> 01:13:39.788
I still didn't say anything and
I really wanted to. I just...


1118
01:13:40.412 --> 01:13:41.722
I don't know.

1119
01:13:43.639 --> 01:13:46.417
I'm really sorry that it got
so bad for you.


1120
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:50.491
That's really nice to hear.
Thank you.


1121
01:13:50.639 --> 01:13:51.739
Yeah well it's wrong.

1122
01:13:52.038 --> 01:13:54.171
What Lindsay and her stupid
friends were doing to you.


1123
01:13:54.484 --> 01:13:55.795
It's not right that they get
away with it.


1124
01:13:58.832 --> 01:13:59.712
Yeah.

1125
01:14:04.187 --> 01:14:06.468
There you are. I was worried
about you.


1126
01:14:07.249 --> 01:14:08.329
You okay?

1127
01:14:10.226 --> 01:14:12.239
I don't want us to give up on
trying to get a law passed.


1128
01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.492
Well we can always try
and find a new senator.


1129
01:14:15.515 --> 01:14:16.918
No I wanna try something else.

1130
01:14:19.223 --> 01:14:20.982
Dr. Rilke says we have
to call attention to it.


1131
01:14:21.012 --> 01:14:22.666
So I wanna call attention to it.

1132
01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.799
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?

1133
01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:27.003
Someone's gotta do something
about this.


1134
01:14:33.124 --> 01:14:34.439
Yeah Jay P will do.

1135
01:14:34.672 --> 01:14:35.666
Uh-huh

1136
01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:37.547
Yeah, just email it to me.

1137
01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:39.915
Okay, thanks.

1138
01:14:41.184 --> 01:14:45.184
Sorry. I spend more time chasing
photos than I do writing the story.


1139
01:14:45.379 --> 01:14:47.684
Okay. So where were we?

1140
01:14:48.019 --> 01:14:50.355
We were talking about how
um kids are getting hurt


1141
01:14:50.559 --> 01:14:54.129
and adults can't see it because
it's happening online


1142
01:14:54.675 --> 01:14:56.402
and the government isn't
doing anything about it,


1143
01:14:56.429 --> 01:14:57.879
so we need public pressure.

1144
01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:59.615
I won't argue that.

1145
01:14:59.793 --> 01:15:03.629
But as far as your story goes
well it's not news.


1146
01:15:04.028 --> 01:15:06.254
I doubt my editor will let
me run with it.


1147
01:15:07.277 --> 01:15:08.132
Although...

1148
01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.982
You said your friend Samantha
made a fake identity


1149
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:14.176
and posted things about you
that weren't true?


1150
01:15:14.733 --> 01:15:15.533
Yeah.

1151
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.777
See, now that could be an
interesting angle.


1152
01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:20.777
A join interview with
the bully and the bullied.


1153
01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:22.682
Think she'd talk to me?

1154
01:15:22.744 --> 01:15:24.184
Uh no. Why would she?

1155
01:15:24.238 --> 01:15:27.059
Lots of people don't wanna talk
to me but lots of people do.


1156
01:15:27.184 --> 01:15:28.918
Tell you what, why don't you
give me her number,


1157
01:15:29.059 --> 01:15:30.751
I'll give her a call invite her down.

1158
01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:32.165
She might just go for it.

1159
01:15:32.335 --> 01:15:35.873
Uh I don't think she'd wanna
talk about it.


1160
01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:39.764
Um here's her mother's number.

1161
01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.285
Um her name is Karen Caldone.

1162
01:15:42.427 --> 01:15:44.585
Samantha may be leaving for school.

1163
01:15:50.686 --> 01:15:51.566
Why did you do that?

1164
01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.349
I'm sorry. I should
have asked you first.


1165
01:15:53.605 --> 01:15:55.855
You know she's gonna think
I'm after her and I'm not.


1166
01:15:56.393 --> 01:15:57.604
Honey..

1167
01:15:57.974 --> 01:16:01.644
It's not a bad idea for Samantha to
face the consequences of her actions.


1168
01:16:01.777 --> 01:16:02.861
Yeah but not like this.

1169
01:16:06.514 --> 01:16:08.704
Her mother said Samantha agreed to do it.

1170
01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:10.516
They'll be here in half an hour.

1171
01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:22.592
Go on in.

1172
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:26.761
Hey.

1173
01:16:27.144 --> 01:16:28.972
Samantha you can sit by Taylor.

1174
01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.663
We want you sitting
together so we can


1175
01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.537
take a few shots
while we talk, okay?


1176
01:16:35.703 --> 01:16:38.112
All right...Samantha.

1177
01:16:38.279 --> 01:16:42.335
Taylor told me a pretty wild
story, that you her best friend,


1178
01:16:42.483 --> 01:16:44.832
tricked her into believing you
were someone else online


1179
01:16:45.706 --> 01:16:48.045
and then as that alternate person,

1180
01:16:48.199 --> 01:16:51.407
you spread rumors about her
in an online community.


1181
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.241
Is that true?

1182
01:16:54.292 --> 01:16:55.108
Yes.

1183
01:16:56.901 --> 01:16:59.479
She didn't think you'd wanna admit it.

1184
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.850
Yeah. Why are you doing this?

1185
01:17:04.842 --> 01:17:07.130
I hate what I did but...

1186
01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:09.721
I'm not gonna pretend I didn't do it.

1187
01:17:09.829 --> 01:17:12.637
Well why, you pretended
just fine before?


1188
01:17:13.764 --> 01:17:15.671
It sounds like you're
still pretty upset at her.


1189
01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:19.340
She has every right to still be mad.

1190
01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:22.542
What I did was horrible,

1191
01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:27.135
and I've never been more
sorry in my entire life.


1192
01:17:30.023 --> 01:17:31.902
Well why do it then?

1193
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.979
I had reasons that made
sense at the time.


1194
01:17:36.744 --> 01:17:39.383
I thought I was protecting
her from a guy.


1195
01:17:42.872 --> 01:17:46.240
I was hurt, angry...

1196
01:17:46.914 --> 01:17:48.273
I don't know, jealous.

1197
01:17:48.483 --> 01:17:51.891
But the reasons didn't matter
once I'd realized I'd hurt her.


1198
01:17:54.423 --> 01:17:57.311
So what was going on
through your mind?


1199
01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.352
When you were doing it,
the cyberbullying?


1200
01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:04.566
It's hard to picture myself like that.

1201
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.178
You know I'd always thought of bullies

1202
01:18:08.738 --> 01:18:11.177
as people at school who pick on you.

1203
01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:17.446
But when you do it online, you don't
even realize that you're doing it.


1204
01:18:19.506 --> 01:18:21.950
You can't see the other people

1205
01:18:21.983 --> 01:18:25.702
and... and you can do or say anything,

1206
01:18:25.741 --> 01:18:27.811
and it doesn't seem to matter.

1207
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.229
It doesn't feel real.

1208
01:18:36.236 --> 01:18:38.595
But it's real when you're
the one getting bullied.


1209
01:18:40.143 --> 01:18:42.652
I know because everyone's
turned on me now


1210
01:18:44.624 --> 01:18:48.585
and Taylor I am so sorry that I
ever made you feel anything...


1211
01:18:48.705 --> 01:18:49.546
Wait...

1212
01:18:51.778 --> 01:18:54.666
Lindsay and them they're after
you now? I didn't know that.


1213
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.456
It doesn't matter.

1214
01:18:58.819 --> 01:19:00.059
I deserve it.

1215
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.709
No you don't.

1216
01:19:28.506 --> 01:19:29.465
Taylor?

1217
01:19:30.837 --> 01:19:32.751
I hope this can be the first step
for you and Samantha to...


1218
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:35.454
Mom please let's just go.

1219
01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:40.776
Hey Samantha, wait.

1220
01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:48.438
Thanks for doing this.

1221
01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:52.539
They... they wouldn't have run
the story unless you did it too.


1222
01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:54.068
It's fine.

1223
01:19:54.098 --> 01:19:56.405
If it's happening to you now.

1224
01:19:56.655 --> 01:19:57.596
They have support group
for that kind of thing


1225
01:19:57.611 --> 01:19:59.875
and it's actually really
been helping me.


1226
01:20:01.112 --> 01:20:02.211
Thanks.

1227
01:20:03.479 --> 01:20:04.789
I'll think about it.

1228
01:20:11.632 --> 01:20:13.611
I think that went really
well, don't you?


1229
01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:19.627
I'm ready to go back to school.

1230
01:20:28.997 --> 01:20:30.526
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


1231
01:20:31.777 --> 01:20:33.206
I wish I could go in.

1232
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.225
Go to class with you,
go to lunch with you...


1233
01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:37.077
I'm gonna be fine.

1234
01:20:38.214 --> 01:20:39.536
All this group has been saying

1235
01:20:39.545 --> 01:20:41.834
is how I can't let them have
power over me anymore


1236
01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.895
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1237
01:20:44.929 --> 01:20:46.858
When did you get all grown-up?

1238
01:20:48.861 --> 01:20:50.965
Oh my God! Are you serious?

1239
01:20:50.987 --> 01:20:52.271
I better go.

1240
01:20:56.325 --> 01:20:57.585
- Bye.
- Bye.


1241
01:21:30.067 --> 01:21:30.977
Hey.

1242
01:21:32.767 --> 01:21:35.256
I didn't know you'd be
coming back today.


1243
01:21:36.607 --> 01:21:38.106
Yeah, I didn't either.

1244
01:21:45.018 --> 01:21:46.997
Maybe we can sit together.

1245
01:21:48.399 --> 01:21:50.088
You really want to?

1246
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.098
I don't know if we can ever
be friends in the same way


1247
01:21:54.128 --> 01:21:56.042
but I'm willing to try.

1248
01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.893
I've really missed you.

1249
01:22:06.665 --> 01:22:08.164
Well let's go in then.

1250
01:22:12.775 --> 01:22:14.064
Hey over here!

1251
01:22:22.435 --> 01:22:25.513
Oh look, it's the psycho twins.

1252
01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:26.880
Just ignore her.

1253
01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.932
No, I'm not gonna ignore it anymore.

1254
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:35.299
Hey Lindsay?

1255
01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:38.920
Hey, I know you think
you're being funny.


1256
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:40.787
But you should know
your words actually hurt


1257
01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.649
and I think you should stop
attacking people online.


1258
01:22:46.746 --> 01:22:47.605
Get her linds.

1259
01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:50.229
No, she's right. 
You guys should stop.

1260
01:22:50.314 --> 01:22:52.372
You're making everyone
around you miserable.


1261
01:22:52.497 --> 01:22:54.966
Aw the twins are
sticking up for each other.


1262
01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:55.786
How cute.

1263
01:22:55.966 --> 01:22:58.380
Yeah because that's what friends do.

1264
01:22:59.003 --> 01:23:01.989
Why you just stop attacking
people on Clicksters, okay?


1265
01:23:02.036 --> 01:23:04.446
You're making it so no one
wants to go on there anymore.


1266
01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.755
Yeah you seem to me
just like any other bully.


1267
01:23:07.038 --> 01:23:08.732
Spreading hate wherever you go.

1268
01:23:08.964 --> 01:23:10.888
- Oh!
- Yeah man.


1269
01:23:11.114 --> 01:23:13.801
I've gotta say the way that
you guys need to hurt people.


1270
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:16.833
Maybe you need to talk
to someone and get some help.


1271
01:23:27.331 --> 01:23:29.500
Get out of my face losers.

1272
01:23:33.823 --> 01:23:35.183
Get out of here!

1273
01:23:35.216 --> 01:23:39.258
Okay, I've dreamed about something
like that only a hundred times.


1274
01:23:39.472 --> 01:23:43.104
Hope it was good for you Taylor
'cause it was awesome for me.


1275
01:23:43.316 --> 01:23:44.216
Yeah.

1276
01:23:52.098 --> 01:23:53.957
Well you finally stood up.

1277
01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:57.559
I'm sorry I took so long. I just...

1278
01:23:58.081 --> 01:24:00.133
You know things got so intense and...

1279
01:24:00.147 --> 01:24:01.612
It's okay. I know.

1280
01:24:02.306 --> 01:24:03.405
I'm sorry.

1281
01:24:05.204 --> 01:24:08.292
Well I am starving.
Let's go get some food.


1282
01:24:08.383 --> 01:24:09.687
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.


1283
01:24:09.693 --> 01:24:10.937
It's okay.

1284
01:24:16.736 --> 01:24:18.695
So you said something this time.

1285
01:24:19.686 --> 01:24:22.054
You were inspiring.
I was impressed.


1286
01:24:22.218 --> 01:24:24.530
Really? 'Cause I think
I'm still shaking.


1287
01:24:25.976 --> 01:24:28.065
I'm really glad you're back.

1288
01:24:28.702 --> 01:24:29.801
Me too.

1289
01:24:31.265 --> 01:24:34.263
So could I maybe sit
and eat lunch with you?


1290
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.708
Maybe I can be the one
who gets the ketchup.


1291
01:24:37.844 --> 01:24:39.903
Yeah I think I'd like that.

1292
01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:51.411
This is Kris.

1293
01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:53.231
Hi. Terry dunley
down at the paper.


1294
01:24:53.497 --> 01:24:54.739
I just wanted to tell you that

1295
01:24:54.802 --> 01:24:57.238
I called Senator Evans to
get a comment from him


1296
01:24:57.351 --> 01:25:00.169
about shooting you down on
sponsoring the cyberbully bill.


1297
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:02.153
- Oh really?
- Oh yes


1298
01:25:02.292 --> 01:25:04.520
and he said you misunderstood him.

1299
01:25:04.714 --> 01:25:08.411
He said his staff is already working
on a proposal to make a new law


1300
01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:13.171
that will make it illegal to harass
minors online in this state


1301
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:16.070
and he's talking to the school
board to get their input.


1302
01:25:16.148 --> 01:25:17.294
That's terrific.
