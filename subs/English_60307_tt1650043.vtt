1
00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:54.482
Seventh-grader.

2
00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.735
Sounds a lot better
than sixth-grader.


3
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.407
This is a Greg thing.
l don't see why l had to come.


4
00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:07.286
Because, Rodrick,
this is a family event,


5
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:09.747
and like it or not,
you're part of the Heffley family.


6
00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:13.209
Yeah.
That and we already paid for your ticket.


7
00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:27.807
I'd Iike to give a warm welcome to
Westmore seventh-graders!


8
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.143
A new year
of school starting.


9
00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:33.813
Hi!

10
00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:35.856
Rowley!
Greg!


11
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.952
Alakazam!
Alaka-zoo-wee Mama!


12
00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.412
What are you doing?

13
00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.621
lt's a magic wand.

14
00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:51.789
Do you want
to see a trick?


15
00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:53.749
Only if the trick
is to make the thing disappear.


16
00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.048
Just put it
in your pocket!


17
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.217
You don't want to
give away your best tricks in public.


18
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.469
So, how was your summer?

19
00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:21.402
That sounds
pretty rough.


20
00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:23.446
The only good thing
that happened


21
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.406
was l got rid of
the Cheese Touch.


22
00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:26.782
Who'd you give it to?

23
00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.034
The new kid.
Jeremy Pindle.


24
00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:31.495
Cheese Touch!

25
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.500
Hey, guys!
Anyone for pizza?


26
00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.087
Hey! Thanks, Fregley.

27
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:42.631
You know,

28
00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:46.635
l can't believe people
leave perfectly good food just lying around.


29
00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:10.868
l'll save that

30
00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.579
for later.

31
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.084
Let's skate.

32
00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:21.337
I'd Iike to give a shout out
to Taylor Pringle!


33
00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:22.588
Uh-oh, dork alert!

34
00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.508
Happy birthday, Taylor!
Five years young.


35
00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:28.052
I hope your
party's a blast.


36
00:03:28.178 --> 00:03:30.596
Rowley,
stop pulling me down!


37
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.058
Ho, ho, ho
It's magic


38
00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:36.644
You know

39
00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:39.230
Who is that?

40
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:44.068
Her name is Holly Hills.
She just moved here.


41
00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:45.945
What grade is she in?
Seventh.


42
00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.488
She's an all-star
soccer player,


43
00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:49.031
has done
professional modeling,


44
00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:51.158
and was her sixth grade
class president.


45
00:03:51.243 --> 00:03:54.453
She moved here from Oregon
because her father got a big promotion.


46
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:56.705
They drive a hybrid SUV,

47
00:03:56.873 --> 00:04:00.334
live on the north side of town
in a cul-de-sac near the park.


48
00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:03.087
What? l googled her!

49
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:05.339
She's a picture
of loveliness, is she not?


50
00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:07.716
She's almost as
pretty as my mom.


51
00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:10.344
She's going to be
very popular.


52
00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.226
Sit here!
Sit here!


53
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.896
Please, everyone, sit down.
We have our seats.


54
00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:30.239
It's magic, you know

55
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.829
Never believe it's not so

56
00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:37.913
Excuse me.

57
00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:40.958
What?

58
00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:43.669
l said, excuse me.
You're blocking the exit.


59
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.171
Oh, sorry.

60
00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:46.463
That's okay.

61
00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:49.508
l'm Chirag Gupta.
And l'm single.


62
00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:52.887
Wow. My name is. . .

63
00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:54.221
We know exactly
who you are.


64
00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:56.348
Holly Hills of

65
00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.392
No, we don't know
who you are.


66
00:04:58.476 --> 00:04:59.768
We have no idea
who you are.


67
00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:07.735
Okay! Well, l think l'm going
to go skating now.


68
00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:12.239
Please congratulate your father
on his promotion from me!


69
00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:16.202
"We know exactly who you are"?
You trying to scare her?


70
00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:17.453
Does it really matter?

71
00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:20.206
A girl like that is
out of your league anyway, Gregory.


72
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.292
She's new.
She isn't out of anyone's league yet.


73
00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:25.961
She doesn't know
the social pecking order.


74
00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:28.672
lf there was ever
a time for me to make a move,


75
00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:30.132
it's now.

76
00:05:32.344 --> 00:05:34.011
Hey, Greg!

77
00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:36.597
Can you break a leg or something
so we can leave?


78
00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:42.228
Oh!

79
00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:45.022
That'll never happen.
Not a chance.


80
00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:47.107
There's no way
that girl will ever talk to you.


81
00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:50.277
Yeah, well,
l just talked to her


82
00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:52.112
and we'll probably
skate later.


83
00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:54.531
Really? Okay.

84
00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:56.951
Well, you see
that clock?


85
00:05:57.327 --> 00:06:00.663
They play a slow song
at the top of every hour for couples skate.


86
00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:04.667
lf you're so confident,
ask her to skate.


87
00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:07.670
Maybe l will.

88
00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:09.338
What you waiting
for, wimp?


89
00:06:09.923 --> 00:06:10.923
You the man!

90
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.596
Look, if we can
get out to Holly


91
00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:20.599
and be standing right next to her
when the clock changes,


92
00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:23.852
then l can ask her to skate
and she'll have to say yes.


93
00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:26.897
l don't know
about that.


94
00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:39.451
Oh, honey, hi!

95
00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:41.787
Remember when we were
young like this,


96
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.790
and we used to dance
and go to parties, and things like that?


97
00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:45.874
Whoo!

98
00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:57.845
l'm going in.
Cover me!


99
00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:14.111
Girl you are to me
all that a woman should be


100
00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:16.322
And I dedicate my life...

101
00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:20.034
All rockers and hardcore skaters
off the rink,


102
00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:22.494
unless you're
looking for love.


103
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.621
It's time for
couples skate.


104
00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:26.415
l'm making my move.

105
00:07:30.962 --> 00:07:37.051
Stop! Enough of that total lameness!
Who's ready to rock? Yeah!


106
00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:43.932
Come on, let's get
out of here. Come on.


107
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:57.613
What are we gonna do?
Stay calm.


108
00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:00.115
All we have to do
is just stay here.


109
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.951
Whoa! Whoa!

110
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:05.537
Rowley! Hang on!

111
00:08:10.627 --> 00:08:13.003
Greg Heffley!

112
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.006
This is your mother.

113
00:08:16.674 --> 00:08:19.301
Everything is
going to be okay.


114
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:23.055
Stay where you are, and your father is
going to come rescue you.


115
00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:26.975
I repeat, everything
is going to be okay.


116
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.230
Okay, here he comes. Here comes Frank.
I see him. He's on his way.


117
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:34.650
Dad!
l know, l know.


118
00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:38.445
Okay.
All right, everyone, go back to skating!


119
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.530
You all right?

120
00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:45.369
Hey, Romeo,
how'd it go with the new girl?


121
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:49.540
Whoa!

122
00:08:55.088 --> 00:08:57.297
You ruined
my birthday!


123
00:08:58.049 --> 00:08:59.425
You jerk!

124
00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:06.140
Ow! Ow! That hurt!

125
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:23.240
Rodrick!

126
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.410
Here, catch!

127
00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:36.336
Let me start by saying
that having a brother is really overrated.


128
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:38.714
Rowley always says
he wishes he had a brother,


129
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.133
and, boy, do l wish
l could give him one of mine.


130
00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:44.261
l've looked into it
and, unfortunately, it's not legal,


131
00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:46.472
l mean,
Manny has been telling on me


132
00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:48.390
ever since he was
able to speak.


133
00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:50.017
Bubby did it.

134
00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:55.481
Bubby did it.

135
00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:56.565
Greg!

136
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.109
And Rodrick is
the king of laziness.


137
00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:01.695
Except when it comes
to torturing me.


138
00:10:05.408 --> 00:10:06.742
My mom has
started writing


139
00:10:06.826 --> 00:10:08.702
an advice column
for the local paper.


140
00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:10.496
She wrote an article
last week


141
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.248
about how your brothers
will always be there for you.


142
00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:16.460
Well, that's exactly
what l'm afraid of.


143
00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:21.757
Hey, Bubby.

144
00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:25.844
Got to go, Mom.
Later, Mom.


145
00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:27.304
Yeah, see you, hon.
Okay, okay, wait.


146
00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:28.889
Hold on.
Wait a second.


147
00:10:28.973 --> 00:10:31.350
l need a moment
for a family meeting.


148
00:10:32.018 --> 00:10:35.020
Now, your father and l
have been talking.


149
00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:39.107
Things between you two
have really gotten out of hand.


150
00:10:39.776 --> 00:10:40.859
Can l just say. . .

151
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:41.944
You may not
realize it now,


152
00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:46.448
but having a brother is one of the most important
relationships of your life.


153
00:10:46.783 --> 00:10:48.951
l mean, one day you're gonna be
Uncle Greg


154
00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:50.911
and Uncle Rodrick
to each other's kids.


155
00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:54.623
That's important.
So you need to get to know each other.


156
00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:55.707
What?
What?


157
00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:58.210
You need to spend more time together.
What?


158
00:10:58.294 --> 00:11:00.587
So that's why l've come up
with a new program


159
00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:04.591
that's going to reward you
for spending time together.


160
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.679
l'm calling it

161
00:11:08.763 --> 00:11:10.430
"Mom Bucks."

162
00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:13.433
You're paying us
with fake money? Yeah.


163
00:11:13.518 --> 00:11:16.562
Okay, now, for every hour
that you spend together without fighting,


164
00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:20.023
for example, let's say
you give Greg a drum lesson,


165
00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:22.985
you each earn
a Mom Buck,


166
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:26.405
which you can
then trade in for one real dollar.


167
00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:27.656
Oh.

168
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.326
So, to start you off,
l'm giving you each five Mom Bucks.


169
00:11:32.537 --> 00:11:35.455
Now, if you're smart,
you'll save up your Mom Bucks. . .


170
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.332
Can l cash out now?

171
00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:40.586
Well, Rodrick,
if you save. . .


172
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.170
But can l cash out?

173
00:11:43.756 --> 00:11:44.923
Yes, but. . .

174
00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.133
l want to cash out.

175
00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:47.676
Frank?
l know.


176
00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:53.140
Uh. . . Okay.
Yes, you can. All right.


177
00:11:54.934 --> 00:11:57.436
Okay. All right, great.
We should get going,


178
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.521
because you don't want
to be late for school. All right?


179
00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:01.356
Yeah, gotta go.
Let's go. Okay, all right.


180
00:12:02.358 --> 00:12:05.485
This Mom Bucks thing
is a gold mine, muchacho.


181
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:07.487
You better not
ruin it for me.


182
00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:09.823
Most kids hate it
when summer ends,


183
00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:14.411
but I have to say, right now,
school is starting to look pretty good.


184
00:12:25.214 --> 00:12:31.511
Welcome back.

185
00:12:31.596 --> 00:12:33.430
lt's nice not to be
the new kids this year.


186
00:12:33.514 --> 00:12:34.598
l agree.

187
00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:37.017
l know. Look at all
the tiny sixth-graders.


188
00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:39.394
l'm so glad that's
not me this year.


189
00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.063
Just a little higher.
Just a little higher.


190
00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:47.110
Whoa! Greg!
Look who's in our class.


191
00:12:49.614 --> 00:12:52.366
This was my chance.
If I could sit next to Holly,


192
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.284
I'd have the whole year
to show her how great I am.


193
00:12:55.453 --> 00:12:56.912
No way, Greg Heffley.

194
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.623
This is my seat.

195
00:12:59.707 --> 00:13:01.249
No, it's not.
l was here first.


196
00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.003
lt's mine!

197
00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:06.171
Let go!

198
00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:08.382
You know
l'm stronger than you, Greg Heffley.


199
00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:11.176
Don't make me
beat you up again!


200
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.427
Let's get
something straight.


201
00:13:12.553 --> 00:13:14.930
l was sick that day
and l had something in my eye.


202
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:16.765
Well!

203
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:20.977
l've never had
students so eager to start the school year.


204
00:13:21.062 --> 00:13:22.187
What's going on?

205
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.647
This is my seat!
This is my seat!


206
00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:27.734
Okay, let's start again.
What are your names?


207
00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:32.447
Patty Farrell,
two R's, two L's.


208
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.788
Greg Heffley.

209
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.292
Would you be related
to Rodrick Heffley?


210
00:14:04.814 --> 00:14:07.774
l've got my eye
on you, Heffley.


211
00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:14.239
There's no way to escape.

212
00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:21.997
lt's unbelievable!
Even at school, Rodrick is ruining my life.


213
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.290
Shh!

214
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
He might hear you.

215
00:14:26.043 --> 00:14:28.044
Nah. Watch.

216
00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:31.882
Holy cow!

217
00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:34.176
He once slept through
an entire day.


218
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.720
Do you have an amazing talent
that you'd like to share?


219
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.600
Today, Plainview City Council
announced a brand-new local contest:


220
00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:43.268
Plainview's Most Talented.

221
00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:45.353
Hey! Greg!
Maybe we should. . .


222
00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:46.813
Can it,
Chunky Cheese!


223
00:14:46.898 --> 00:14:50.317
Westmore is absolutely
packed to the roof with talent.


224
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:52.903
The top prize is $1,000
and, of course,


225
00:14:52.987 --> 00:14:54.946
the admiration
of your friends and neighbors.


226
00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:58.450
This is huge. l gotta call the band.
We gotta practice.


227
00:14:58.534 --> 00:14:59.785
This is gonna be
our big break!


228
00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:01.036
Uh-uh-uh.
Wait a second.


229
00:15:01.704 --> 00:15:03.455
Aren't you forgetting something?
What?


230
00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:05.290
l showered yesterday.
Smell.


231
00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:07.042
Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.


232
00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:10.045
We agreed that you'd give
a drum lesson to Greg.


233
00:15:10.755 --> 00:15:11.838
You were serious?

234
00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:12.964
Who knows?

235
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.883
Maybe you guys
will really like it


236
00:15:14.967 --> 00:15:16.468
and we can
form a family band.


237
00:15:18.638 --> 00:15:21.598
Hello, world, here's a song
that we're singing


238
00:15:21.682 --> 00:15:24.017
Come on get happy

239
00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:29.856
A whole lotta lovin'
is what we'll be bringing


240
00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:31.775
We'll make you happy

241
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.242
Rodrick says
he's a professional musician,


242
00:15:40.326 --> 00:15:42.953
but as far as I know
the only money he's made,


243
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:45.956
is when Dad gave him
five bucks once to stop playing.


244
00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:48.208
When do we get to
play the real drums?


245
00:15:48.584 --> 00:15:50.252
Like l'd ever
let you touch them!


246
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.296
Watch and learn,
earthworm!


247
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.759
Hey, l was thinking
we should enter the talent show.


248
00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:00.512
l could do my magic act
and you could be my assistant.


249
00:16:00.596 --> 00:16:02.013
Assistant? No way.

250
00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:04.516
Doing magic tricks
is bad enough.


251
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.810
Assisting the guy
doing the tricks?


252
00:16:07.103 --> 00:16:09.396
l'd never make it
to eighth grade.


253
00:16:21.868 --> 00:16:23.159
What?

254
00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:24.619
Hey, a cookie.

255
00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:26.329
Manny,
what have you done?


256
00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:28.039
l'm only three.

257
00:16:28.124 --> 00:16:30.292
What's going on?
What did you do to him?


258
00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:32.294
Nothing!
He ruined my video game.


259
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.714
Oh! He didn't do anything on purpose.
Did you, honey?


260
00:16:35.798 --> 00:16:38.925
No, l didn't.
No, he didn't. He's only three.


261
00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.969
l'm only three!

262
00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:43.930
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
You want another cookie?


263
00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:45.348
It's so unfair.

264
00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:47.601
I have Rodrick
making my life a misery on one side,


265
00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:49.227
and Manny attacking me
from the other.


266
00:16:49.312 --> 00:16:53.023
And I'm the only one
who seems to get blamed for anything.


267
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.484
I wonder what it'd be like
to have a family that actually loves me.


268
00:16:56.694 --> 00:16:57.819
Little boy!

269
00:16:58.362 --> 00:17:01.781
We're a very rich couple
with no children and so much love to share.


270
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.492
Won't you come be
part of our family?


271
00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:08.496
Finally!
Someone l can leave my billions to.


272
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.460
lndia? Why would
you go there?


273
00:17:13.628 --> 00:17:17.714
lndia is fascinating.
lt's the jewel of Southeast Asia.


274
00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:19.758
My father has business
to take care of,


275
00:17:19.842 --> 00:17:21.718
so he's taking
the whole family.


276
00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:23.386
Can you bring me
back a cobra?


277
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:25.889
l want to
teach it to dance!


278
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.939
Wake up!
What are you guys doing over there?


279
00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:36.733
Get the ball!
Get the ball, kick it!


280
00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:39.778
Kick it!

281
00:17:39.862 --> 00:17:40.862
Kick it!

282
00:17:43.407 --> 00:17:45.533
Patty Farrell,
you are the man!


283
00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:51.998
Nice running, Heffley.
Just have to work on the direction.


284
00:17:55.878 --> 00:18:00.423
Wow. Holly Hills is better than Bryce.
And he's an all-star!


285
00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:02.300
Well, l'm sure
your soccer skills


286
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.219
made a great
impression on her.


287
00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:06.137
Go strike while
the iron is hot.


288
00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:07.263
You'll see.

289
00:18:07.348 --> 00:18:09.182
When you come back
from lndia,


290
00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:11.101
she'll be
hanging out with me.


291
00:18:13.062 --> 00:18:15.021
l would love for that
to be true, Gregory.


292
00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:17.941
lt would provide hope
for smaller boys everywhere,


293
00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:22.153
but girls like that
just don't hang out with guys like us.


294
00:18:26.575 --> 00:18:30.745
So, listen, you don't have to worry about being
in my magic show anymore,


295
00:18:30.955 --> 00:18:33.957
'cause l got Scotty
from my karate class to be my assistant.


296
00:18:34.375 --> 00:18:36.334
Scotty?
lsn't he like eight?


297
00:18:36.711 --> 00:18:38.753
He'll be eight.

298
00:18:42.842 --> 00:18:44.259
Get in.
Why?


299
00:18:44.343 --> 00:18:45.593
What are you
doing here?


300
00:18:45.678 --> 00:18:46.845
Mom said she'll
pay Mom Bucks


301
00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:48.471
if l drive you
home from school.


302
00:18:49.932 --> 00:18:50.932
We'd rather walk.

303
00:18:51.684 --> 00:18:53.601
Get in! Now!

304
00:18:55.938 --> 00:18:57.522
What happened
to the seats?


305
00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.108
l needed the room
for my new equipment.


306
00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:03.528
How'd you have
the money for that?


307
00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:05.780
You know, Mom Bucks.

308
00:19:07.158 --> 00:19:09.951
There's no way.
He only earned like five.


309
00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:18.334
We got to figure out
what song we're playing at the talent contest.


310
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.711
Easy. Devil's Diper.

311
00:19:19.962 --> 00:19:23.423
A ballad? Really, dude?
We got to lift them out of their seats!


312
00:19:23.507 --> 00:19:24.716
l got it.

313
00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:27.802
Exploded Diper!
Exploded Diper!


314
00:19:28.137 --> 00:19:31.264
Slow down, guys!
Slow down!


315
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
Whoa!

316
00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:51.743
This Mom Bucks thing
isn't working out.


317
00:19:51.827 --> 00:19:55.080
Now Rodrick can get paid
for beating me up.


318
00:19:56.207 --> 00:19:57.457
Oh. . .

319
00:19:59.668 --> 00:20:02.045
Mom, why are you
writing about me again?


320
00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:03.129
lt's embarrassing.

321
00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:07.300
What? You know how important
honesty is to me.


322
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.010
And, Rowley, good news.

323
00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:10.970
l called your mom
and she gave her permission


324
00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:13.515
for you to come with us
to Rockin' Rapids next weekend.


325
00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:16.101
Two days on the biggest
water slides in the world!


326
00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:17.143
lt's gonna be great!

327
00:20:20.147 --> 00:20:21.689
Thank you,
Mrs. Heffley,


328
00:20:21.774 --> 00:20:25.276
but l think
l'd like to stay home and practice my magic act.


329
00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:32.534
l just want to
perfect my art.


330
00:20:35.037 --> 00:20:36.913
Come on,
let's go upstairs.


331
00:20:37.123 --> 00:20:38.915
Mom, can l
use your computer for homework?


332
00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:41.668
For homework, right?

333
00:20:41.752 --> 00:20:44.087
Yeah. Definitely.
Homework only.


334
00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:46.256
l'm sorry, Bubby.

335
00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:49.259
What's this?

336
00:20:49.718 --> 00:20:51.427
lt's a gift from Manny.

337
00:20:51.512 --> 00:20:53.972
He made it for you
because he wanted to say he was sorry


338
00:20:54.056 --> 00:20:57.350
for breaking your video game.
lsn't that cute?


339
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.103
lt looks dangerous.
What if l sat on that thing?


340
00:21:00.312 --> 00:21:02.939
Greg!
What are you doing?


341
00:21:04.692 --> 00:21:06.693
Tell Manny
you love his gift.


342
00:21:11.991 --> 00:21:14.742
You're so lucky
you don't have any brothers.


343
00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:16.995
You're kind of
like my brother.


344
00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:18.746
And shouldn't we
be looking up things


345
00:21:18.831 --> 00:21:20.582
for your
"hundred years ago" assignment?


346
00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:25.420
She looks like
she was born 100 years ago.


347
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.630
Ahhh!

348
00:21:31.594 --> 00:21:35.013
Oh, l hope she's okay.
She sounded pretty hurt.


349
00:21:35.097 --> 00:21:36.723
Are you kidding me?
She's famous,


350
00:21:36.807 --> 00:21:38.349
and l heard
she's a millionaire.


351
00:21:40.603 --> 00:21:42.103
I would love
to be her!


352
00:21:42.188 --> 00:21:43.521
You do know
she was faking it?


353
00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:44.689
Really?

354
00:21:44.773 --> 00:21:45.940
Of course.

355
00:21:46.025 --> 00:21:47.942
Anyone can be
an lnternet sensation.


356
00:21:48.277 --> 00:21:50.028
We could.
l'm listening.


357
00:21:50.112 --> 00:21:51.946
You just have to work
with what you got.


358
00:21:52.907 --> 00:21:54.532
Wake up in the morning

359
00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:55.867
feeling like P. Diddy

360
00:21:55.951 --> 00:21:59.871
Grab my glasses on,
I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city


361
00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:03.958
Before l leave,
brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack


362
00:22:04.043 --> 00:22:07.879
'Cause when
I leave for the night, I ain't coming back


363
00:22:07.963 --> 00:22:10.715
I'm talking,
playing our favorite CD's


364
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.717
Pulling up to the parties

365
00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:16.137
Trying to get
a little bit tipsy


366
00:22:16.305 --> 00:22:18.890
Okay, three,
two, one, fall.


367
00:22:18.974 --> 00:22:23.353
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!


368
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:27.649
lt looks fake.
lt has to look real.


369
00:22:27.733 --> 00:22:30.735
But how do l fake it
if l'm actually falling backwards?


370
00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:33.112
Maybe you need a gimmick,
so people notice you.


371
00:22:34.323 --> 00:22:35.323
Oh.

372
00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:37.867
Wear this on your head.

373
00:22:41.038 --> 00:22:42.080
Now, do it again.

374
00:22:42.164 --> 00:22:44.749
Why can't you be the one
that falls backwards in the chair?


375
00:22:44.833 --> 00:22:48.169
Because l'm not the one
wearing the underwear on my head.


376
00:22:48.837 --> 00:22:51.923
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no


377
00:22:52.007 --> 00:22:53.758
Remember when
l broke my arm?


378
00:22:53.842 --> 00:22:55.301
That didn't feel
good at. . .


379
00:22:59.014 --> 00:23:03.309
l can't believe you sat on the tinfoil ball!
We're going to be rich!


380
00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:04.602
Okay, Rowley.

381
00:23:05.271 --> 00:23:07.272
Hold still. Oy!

382
00:23:24.248 --> 00:23:27.458
My computer was supposed to be
for homework only.


383
00:23:27.543 --> 00:23:30.211
You lied to me.
You know how l feel about that.


384
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:33.715
Mom, from now on,
l'll be 100% honest.


385
00:23:33.924 --> 00:23:35.633
WeII, that Iasted
about a week.


386
00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:38.970
Mom somehow didn't
appreciate the completely honest version of me.


387
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.765
Happy birthday,
Grandpa!


388
00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:45.643
Next year, l want
a chocolate cake.


389
00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:48.104
That is,
if you're alive next year.


390
00:23:49.023 --> 00:23:50.023
Greg!

391
00:23:50.107 --> 00:23:51.232
Honesty, Mom!

392
00:23:51.984 --> 00:23:55.320
Mom, it's Mrs. Gillman
from the PTA.


393
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.864
Tell her l'm not here!

394
00:23:57.948 --> 00:23:59.741
But that would be lying

395
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:02.243
and l don't do
that anymore.


396
00:24:03.912 --> 00:24:08.249
l'm sorry, Mrs. Gillman,
but my mom isn't in the house right now.


397
00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:17.091
On weekends, I try to stay as far away
from my brothers as possible.


398
00:24:17.176 --> 00:24:20.928
But on Sunday morning,
I have no choice.


399
00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:24.432
Poopy!

400
00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:27.060
Huh?

401
00:24:27.144 --> 00:24:29.937
Greg!
lt looks like he has a candy bar on there.


402
00:24:30.064 --> 00:24:31.564
Manny!

403
00:24:32.941 --> 00:24:34.692
Frank,
you're gonna have to do something.


404
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:36.110
Yeah,
l'll get a rag.


405
00:24:39.948 --> 00:24:41.157
Dad, stop it!

406
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:42.283
Hold still!

407
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:44.619
All right,
let me see.


408
00:24:44.953 --> 00:24:46.871
You're fine.
Can't even tell.


409
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.714
l'm not going in
with a poop stain on my pants.


410
00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:59.092
Okay, well,
you can't skip church.


411
00:24:59.343 --> 00:25:01.427
No, l'm not
going in like this.


412
00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:04.180
Fine.

413
00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:09.102
He made them every one

414
00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:10.186
Go.

415
00:25:12.022 --> 00:25:16.401
All things
bright and beautiful


416
00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:21.572
All creatures
great and small


417
00:25:21.657 --> 00:25:24.158
All things
wise and wonderful


418
00:25:24.243 --> 00:25:26.202
What are you doing? Go!

419
00:25:26.328 --> 00:25:30.790
The Lord God made them all

420
00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:33.000
Please be seated.

421
00:25:35.546 --> 00:25:38.381
Let me just say
how gratifying it is


422
00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:41.259
to see so many
smiling faces here today.


423
00:25:42.177 --> 00:25:44.345
Mothers and fathers. . .

424
00:25:49.351 --> 00:25:51.853
Okay, we're up.

425
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:54.021
Come on! We're up!

426
00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:56.816
But everyone will
see the sweater.


427
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.943
People are looking,
okay?


428
00:25:59.027 --> 00:26:00.570
So come on. Let's go.

429
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:02.029
Come on.

430
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800
Poop!

431
00:26:23.218 --> 00:26:25.261
He's pooped his pants!

432
00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:28.598
No, it isn't
what it looks like!


433
00:26:28.682 --> 00:26:30.683
lt isn't.
lt's chocolate!


434
00:26:31.852 --> 00:26:33.352
Chocolate. See?

435
00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:56.667
What did l say
about being civil to one another?


436
00:26:56.752 --> 00:26:58.669
That's all
l asked of you!


437
00:26:58.754 --> 00:27:00.463
Well, you have
blown it big time!


438
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:02.340
Never been
more embarrassed!


439
00:27:02.466 --> 00:27:04.133
Everyone we know
was there!


440
00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:07.261
l have no idea how l'm gonna write
my column this week.


441
00:27:07.387 --> 00:27:09.305
l feel like
a complete fraud!


442
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:11.390
Well, you brought
this on yourselves.


443
00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:13.434
You can kiss
Rockin' Rapids good-bye!


444
00:27:13.602 --> 00:27:17.104
You two will stay here
all weekend and work out your differences.


445
00:27:17.189 --> 00:27:19.690
And if you don't,
l will.


446
00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:22.693
And trust me,
you don't want any part of that.


447
00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:25.279
Do you understand?

448
00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:27.698
Yes. Yes.
Yes.


449
00:27:28.492 --> 00:27:30.826
All right, let's go.

450
00:27:38.794 --> 00:27:41.462
And don't have
anybody over this weekend.


451
00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:43.297
Got it?

452
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.996
Snacks in the bowls,
ice in the freezer, cups on the table.


453
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.581
Your party
better be good.


454
00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:18.124
Our party, little bro.

455
00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:23.170
Wait! Whoa, whoa!
We need chairs from the basement.


456
00:28:23.922 --> 00:28:24.922
For what?

457
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.592
ln case we wanna
play musical chairs.


458
00:28:27.718 --> 00:28:30.386
l haven't played
musical chairs since the second grade.


459
00:28:30.512 --> 00:28:33.848
Well, it comes back
when you hit high school.


460
00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:35.725
Wait! You get the chairs.

461
00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:37.810
l don't want anyone to be disappointed.
All right?


462
00:28:38.061 --> 00:28:39.312
Okay.
All right.


463
00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:08.841
Rodrick, help!
The door's closed!


464
00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.343
Yeah, and it's
staying closed.


465
00:29:10.427 --> 00:29:12.303
l don't need a middle-schooler
ruining my party.


466
00:29:12.387 --> 00:29:14.138
What? l thought
it was our party!


467
00:29:14.222 --> 00:29:17.308
lt's my party.
Now keep quiet or l'll lock you in the dryer!


468
00:29:17.392 --> 00:29:18.809
Rodrick!

469
00:29:19.936 --> 00:29:20.978
Greg!

470
00:30:13.281 --> 00:30:15.574
And that's magic!

471
00:30:19.287 --> 00:30:21.664
Jefferson residence.
Rowley speaking.


472
00:30:21.748 --> 00:30:23.833
Rowley, l need
your help! Now!


473
00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:30.798
Holy pepperoni!

474
00:30:35.303 --> 00:30:37.304
Get inside.
Open the door and let me out!


475
00:30:45.981 --> 00:30:47.398
Yes! You did it!

476
00:30:48.442 --> 00:30:51.152
lt's a really
nice try, Greggy.


477
00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:55.656
But whatever you thought,
l already thinked it.


478
00:31:02.664 --> 00:31:06.125
When our band is huge,
we'll have parties every night!


479
00:31:07.043 --> 00:31:09.462
But they'll be
backstage parties!


480
00:31:09.546 --> 00:31:11.922
Sweet!
We'll get to go backstage.


481
00:31:16.845 --> 00:31:18.095
You, don't touch
that phone!


482
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.473
Music off!
Everybody freeze!


483
00:31:20.557 --> 00:31:22.183
Freeze.

484
00:31:23.977 --> 00:31:27.104
lf anyone makes a sound,
the party is over


485
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.357
and l am a dead man.
So. . . Shh!


486
00:31:32.778 --> 00:31:34.528
Quiet, man!

487
00:31:36.823 --> 00:31:38.574
Get back!

488
00:31:39.201 --> 00:31:41.952
Shh!

489
00:31:42.037 --> 00:31:43.913
Hello?
Rodrick, it's Mom.


490
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:46.832
ls everything okay?
lt took a long time for you to answer.


491
00:31:46.917 --> 00:31:49.835
Yeah, everything's fine.
l was just washing dishes.


492
00:31:50.212 --> 00:31:52.963
Okay, honey. Well, l just wanted to check in
and say l love you,


493
00:31:53.048 --> 00:31:54.632
and l'm sorry l was
so harsh earlier.


494
00:31:54.716 --> 00:31:55.841
No problem. Bye.

495
00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:57.593
Now let me say
good night to Greg.


496
00:31:57.677 --> 00:31:58.636
Greg?

497
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.054
Oh, uh. . .

498
00:32:00.722 --> 00:32:02.765
He can't. He's asleep.
l don't want to wake him.


499
00:32:02.849 --> 00:32:05.893
No, l'm not.
l'm right here. Hi, Mom.


500
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.062
Hey, Rodrick.

501
00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:10.064
Hi, sweetie,
is everything okay?


502
00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:11.857
Why were you
sleeping so early?


503
00:32:11.942 --> 00:32:16.195
Well, actually, l wasn't sleeping.
l'm down in the basement.


504
00:32:16.321 --> 00:32:19.490
The basement?
What the heck are you doing down there?


505
00:32:19.574 --> 00:32:21.534
Wouldn't you
rather be up here hanging with me?


506
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.621
Yeah, l would, Rodrick.
Why don't you come down and get me?


507
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:26.831
Now.

508
00:32:26.957 --> 00:32:28.666
l think they're
trying to get along.


509
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.001
Huh? That's good.
Good, honey.


510
00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:34.672
Okay.
Everything is cool here, right, Greg?


511
00:32:35.924 --> 00:32:38.551
Yeah, Mom.
And l have your number if l need you.


512
00:32:38.635 --> 00:32:42.513
Okay, sweeties.
Well, we'll see you tomorrow. Good night.


513
00:32:46.643 --> 00:32:48.102
Listen up.

514
00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.148
lf you do anything
that embarrasses me, anything at all,


515
00:32:53.441 --> 00:32:55.025
l will. . .

516
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.402
You'll what?

517
00:32:58.488 --> 00:33:01.657
Just stay out
of my way,


518
00:33:03.285 --> 00:33:04.285
nerds.

519
00:33:09.624 --> 00:33:11.667
l think we should
go upstairs.


520
00:33:12.002 --> 00:33:13.335
Are you kidding me?

521
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.047
We might not get to go to
another high school party for five more years.


522
00:33:17.132 --> 00:33:18.549
We have an
opportunity here,


523
00:33:18.633 --> 00:33:22.303
to see things no other kid in our grade
has ever seen before.


524
00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:23.804
Like what?

525
00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:25.222
Teenage things.

526
00:33:25.348 --> 00:33:28.559
Just follow my lead,
and we'll be fine.


527
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:42.239
Hey, watch the elbows,
popcorn dude. Not cool.


528
00:33:46.661 --> 00:33:48.537
That was a close one.

529
00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:57.880
l didn't know you
could get up there.


530
00:33:59.007 --> 00:34:00.424
You should
hear my band.


531
00:34:00.508 --> 00:34:03.093
We play so loud,
we actually make people's eardrums bleed.


532
00:34:03.219 --> 00:34:04.762
Ew.
l mean, not really.


533
00:34:06.973 --> 00:34:08.015
l think your
brother likes her!


534
00:34:14.356 --> 00:34:15.898
l have to go
find my friend.


535
00:34:15.982 --> 00:34:18.150
Yeah, yeah, l know.

536
00:34:20.487 --> 00:34:23.989
Reminder!
You can't call if you're dead.


537
00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:36.251
Dude, this party is dying.
Look, the girls aren't into it.


538
00:34:36.336 --> 00:34:38.045
Look, they want
to dance.


539
00:34:38.338 --> 00:34:39.964
You don't ask them to dance,
they're gonna leave,


540
00:34:40.048 --> 00:34:41.298
then you're just
gonna be that guy


541
00:34:41.383 --> 00:34:43.050
who threw the lame
party with no girls.


542
00:34:43.134 --> 00:34:44.718
Go ask the girls
to dance!


543
00:34:45.553 --> 00:34:46.804
You ask them.

544
00:34:48.556 --> 00:34:50.182
No, man.
You go ask the girls to dance.


545
00:34:50.266 --> 00:34:51.392
You almost did it.

546
00:34:51.476 --> 00:34:53.352
l'm not going to do it!
l've seen you dance!


547
00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:54.436
l'm not doing it. . .

548
00:34:54.604 --> 00:34:57.564
Did somebody say "dance"?
Break it down!


549
00:34:57.649 --> 00:34:59.400
Rowley, no! Don't!

550
00:35:00.527 --> 00:35:02.486
That kid's dead.
No, wait, man. What are you, new?


551
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.906
You can't mess with a chubby kid,
the girls'll freak out!


552
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.371
l won't call Mom.
You can kill me.


553
00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:14.873
Conga!

554
00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:19.294
What is he doing?

555
00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:22.214
Who cares?
l'm going to go squeeze in


556
00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:24.508
next to Rachel Lewis
and Amy Ramirez!


557
00:35:24.592 --> 00:35:27.511
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake your body line


558
00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:31.849
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time


559
00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:33.892
My girl's name is Senora

560
00:35:33.977 --> 00:35:36.020
I tell you, friends,
I adore her


561
00:35:36.104 --> 00:35:38.022
And when she dances,
oh, brother!


562
00:35:38.106 --> 00:35:40.482
She's a hurricane
in all kinds of weather


563
00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:42.609
Jump in the line,
Rock your body


564
00:35:42.694 --> 00:35:44.194
This is great!

565
00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:46.697
l know!
l wish my mom was here.


566
00:35:46.781 --> 00:35:49.533
Your parents are so cool
to let you have this party.


567
00:35:49.826 --> 00:35:53.662
Yeah, really cool.
And they can never know.


568
00:35:53.747 --> 00:35:55.622
You can talk
about Cha Cha


569
00:35:55.707 --> 00:35:57.541
Tango, Waltz,
or the Rumba


570
00:35:57.625 --> 00:35:59.668
Senora's dance has no title

571
00:35:59.753 --> 00:36:02.296
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to the bridle!


572
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.923
Jump in the line,
Rock your body in time


573
00:36:05.008 --> 00:36:06.508
Whoa!

574
00:36:06.593 --> 00:36:11.805
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time


575
00:36:33.453 --> 00:36:37.414
Hi. You've reached the Heffley residence.
Please leave a message.


576
00:36:37.707 --> 00:36:41.085
Hey, guys. Manny's sick.
We're on our way home.


577
00:36:41.211 --> 00:36:42.628
See you in an hour.

578
00:36:42.837 --> 00:36:44.797
Holy. . .
Moly!


579
00:36:48.968 --> 00:36:50.844
You are in
so much trouble.


580
00:36:53.306 --> 00:36:55.557
Me? You lied to Mom,
just as much as l did.


581
00:36:55.642 --> 00:36:58.644
You know how she feels about lying!
She's gonna kill both of us!


582
00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:06.860
You do the living room,
l'll start the kitchen. Go!


583
00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:12.032
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah


584
00:37:12.117 --> 00:37:15.035
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


585
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.666
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah


586
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.627
I'd rather
you didn't than did


587
00:37:23.711 --> 00:37:26.505
I'd rather
you didn't get rid


588
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:29.216
Of me at that age
Such a young awkward stage


589
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.344
That is not
what you do to a kid


590
00:37:32.428 --> 00:37:35.180
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah


591
00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:38.308
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


592
00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:40.811
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah


593
00:37:40.895 --> 00:37:43.814
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah


594
00:37:43.898 --> 00:37:46.650
If this is the case
Let us cut to the chase


595
00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:49.695
I'm so sorry
I never let go


596
00:37:49.779 --> 00:37:52.656
I went to the doctor
the kind that you talk to


597
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.742
And he said
the process is slow


598
00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:01.206
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


599
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.500
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah


600
00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:06.628
Down, down, down!
All right, let's go.


601
00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:10.007
I'd rather
you hadn't than had


602
00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:12.801
If you hadn't
I wouldn't be mad


603
00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:15.679
At what I'd been handed
Despite it I've landed


604
00:38:15.763 --> 00:38:18.140
On both feet so
don't worry, Dad


605
00:38:18.224 --> 00:38:19.516
lt looks good.

606
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:21.310
Too good.

607
00:38:21.728 --> 00:38:24.479
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


608
00:38:24.564 --> 00:38:25.606
Let's get the kitchen.

609
00:38:27.317 --> 00:38:29.610
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah


610
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:36.116
Maybe we can
paint over it.


611
00:38:36.201 --> 00:38:37.951
l don't know
how to make paint!


612
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:39.536
l got it!

613
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:41.455
See? lt's a good thing
l locked you down here.


614
00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:42.539
Now let's go!

615
00:38:45.376 --> 00:38:46.501
We're not gonna make it!

616
00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:47.628
We're gonna make it.

617
00:38:50.131 --> 00:38:51.798
Trash mine
if you'd like to


618
00:38:51.883 --> 00:38:53.258
I'm sure
you'd be psyched to


619
00:38:53.343 --> 00:38:55.510
Remember our name
is the same


620
00:38:55.595 --> 00:38:57.554
See? Told you
it would work.


621
00:38:59.307 --> 00:39:02.059
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


622
00:39:02.143 --> 00:39:07.231
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah


623
00:39:09.317 --> 00:39:10.317
Rodrick!

624
00:39:10.735 --> 00:39:13.070
The bathroom door!
The door doesn't have a lock on it.


625
00:39:13.154 --> 00:39:15.530
The other door had a lock on it
and this doesn't. We're dead.


626
00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:16.573
And if they find out. . .

627
00:39:20.954 --> 00:39:22.913
- Greg?
- Hey, guys!


628
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:26.041
Hi.
Hey, Mom, Dad.


629
00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:28.710
Hey, how's Manny?
ls he feeling better? Poor little guy.


630
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.588
Yeah. He's doing okay.

631
00:39:31.673 --> 00:39:34.049
Wow.
The house looks pretty good.


632
00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:36.134
l was expecting
a real mess.


633
00:39:36.552 --> 00:39:37.719
Oh. . .

634
00:39:37.804 --> 00:39:39.304
Who ate pretzels
on the rug?


635
00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:42.599
So. . .

636
00:39:44.602 --> 00:39:45.936
Who came over
this weekend?


637
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.605
What? Nobody.

638
00:39:49.065 --> 00:39:51.817
You said nobody, Dad.
No means no, right?


639
00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:54.361
Yeah, yeah. Good boy.

640
00:40:01.035 --> 00:40:02.077
So,

641
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.373
you guys just hung out?

642
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:08.125
Had a good time
together, huh?


643
00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:09.960
Yeah, actually.

644
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:12.170
You know,
l never thought l'd admit this,


645
00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:14.214
but we had a pretty
good time together.


646
00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:16.591
Really?

647
00:40:16.676 --> 00:40:18.885
Yeah. Surprised me, too.

648
00:40:19.012 --> 00:40:23.015
So you just
worked it all out by yourselves?


649
00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:26.476
Yeah, l guess. l don't know.
Mom, don't make a big deal about it.


650
00:40:26.644 --> 00:40:27.853
Please, just. . .
Okay. Okay.


651
00:40:27.937 --> 00:40:30.397
But nothing. . .
Nothing makes me happier


652
00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:31.982
than to see you two
being friends.


653
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:33.191
Right, Frank?

654
00:40:33.276 --> 00:40:34.401
Hmm? Yeah.

655
00:40:36.279 --> 00:40:37.279
Yeah.

656
00:40:38.698 --> 00:40:41.074
Okay, let's go upstairs.

657
00:40:42.618 --> 00:40:44.494
Time for a nappy.

658
00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:49.416
Hey! What the. . .

659
00:40:52.503 --> 00:40:54.671
You guys got something
you want to tell me?


660
00:40:55.882 --> 00:40:56.923
No.

661
00:40:57.592 --> 00:41:02.721
What was General Grant
doing on the thermostat?


662
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.182
l have no idea.

663
00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:06.600
No idea.

664
00:41:07.101 --> 00:41:08.602
No idea, huh?

665
00:41:11.105 --> 00:41:15.609
Don't. . . These. . .
These are off limits! No touch!


666
00:41:15.735 --> 00:41:19.696
They are not toys.
They're figurines!


667
00:41:20.948 --> 00:41:22.032
l can't. . .

668
00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:26.244
We have to keep them
away from the bathroom.


669
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:27.788
For the next 10 years?

670
00:41:27.914 --> 00:41:29.373
Listen to me.

671
00:41:30.208 --> 00:41:33.377
No matter what they ask you,
no matter how hard they push,


672
00:41:33.461 --> 00:41:35.420
deny, deny, deny.

673
00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:40.300
Even if they figure it out,
never ever admit to anything.


674
00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:43.762
Deny, deny, deny.
Got it?


675
00:41:44.347 --> 00:41:47.724
Got it.
Deny, deny, deny.


676
00:41:48.643 --> 00:41:51.645
lt sounds to me like,
"Lie, lie, lie."


677
00:41:51.938 --> 00:41:54.356
l kind of wish
you hadn't told me.


678
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:59.194
Don't you understand?
Rodrick isn't beating me up anymore.


679
00:41:59.278 --> 00:42:02.447
But how are they
not going to notice that the lock's gone?


680
00:42:02.573 --> 00:42:04.491
Please.
They're like 40.


681
00:42:05.034 --> 00:42:07.202
They can barely
remember our names.


682
00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:15.001
Hi, Greg!
l've returned from halfway around the world.


683
00:42:16.379 --> 00:42:19.840
And l see that you're even further than
that from Holly Hills.


684
00:42:19.924 --> 00:42:23.135
l guess your unappealing older brother
was right about you.


685
00:42:23.219 --> 00:42:24.761
You have no game.

686
00:42:25.513 --> 00:42:26.680
You know what?

687
00:42:26.764 --> 00:42:30.308
I liked Chirag a whole lot better
when he was in India.


688
00:42:30.393 --> 00:42:32.602
Man, l sure
do miss Chirag.


689
00:42:32.687 --> 00:42:33.979
l wonder when
he's coming back.


690
00:42:35.314 --> 00:42:37.858
lt's almost like l can
feel his presence.


691
00:42:37.942 --> 00:42:40.861
What are you talking about?
Here l am!


692
00:42:42.405 --> 00:42:43.864
Did you just
hear something?


693
00:42:45.074 --> 00:42:46.241
No. Nothing.

694
00:42:46.576 --> 00:42:50.203
Well, better get to class.
Chirag would've wanted it that way.


695
00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:51.538
Good one, Greg.

696
00:42:51.706 --> 00:42:54.749
You may be able to dominate me physically,
Greg Heffley,


697
00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:57.544
but mentally,
l am the more muscular!


698
00:42:58.004 --> 00:43:00.130
It is officially on.

699
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.015
Hey, Rowley.

700
00:43:10.141 --> 00:43:11.308
Hey.

701
00:43:15.188 --> 00:43:16.646
Does he know
about the D-O-R-E?


702
00:43:17.732 --> 00:43:18.732
Huh?

703
00:43:19.066 --> 00:43:20.066
The door!

704
00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:24.696
Yeah. Don't worry.
l already told him, deny, deny, deny.


705
00:43:24.822 --> 00:43:26.740
Hi, Rowley!
What's new, huh?


706
00:43:34.999 --> 00:43:35.999
Okay.

707
00:43:40.922 --> 00:43:43.965
Hey, wasn't there
a lock on this door?


708
00:43:46.219 --> 00:43:48.553
l must be
losing my marbles.


709
00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:53.600
Oh. l can't take this pressure.
l'm leaving.


710
00:43:54.018 --> 00:43:55.769
Okay, everybody,
dinnertime!


711
00:43:56.437 --> 00:43:58.522
Actually, Mom,
l have to skip dinner.


712
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.357
Why?

713
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:02.692
l've got the most
important meeting of my life tonight.


714
00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:04.528
Did you say you have a meeting?
Yeah.


715
00:44:04.779 --> 00:44:07.739
Like, for like a job?
Yeah. Kind of.


716
00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:10.450
l'm meeting with
the best guitarist in Plainview.


717
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.370
Now he's in between bands,
and if l can get him into Lasded Diper,


718
00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:15.580
then winning
the talent show is a lock.


719
00:44:15.706 --> 00:44:18.833
l mean, you'd like him, Dad.
He's a real professional, like you.


720
00:44:19.085 --> 00:44:20.335
Mmm-hmm.
Be supportive.


721
00:44:21.587 --> 00:44:23.547
That's him.
l'll get that!


722
00:44:23.965 --> 00:44:27.509
Oh, man,
l barely made it here.


723
00:44:27.593 --> 00:44:29.678
Your address has
so many numbers!


724
00:44:30.388 --> 00:44:32.222
All right, Bill, we should. . .
Whoa!


725
00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:36.268
Do l smell pot roast?

726
00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:46.152
Oh! Mmm.

727
00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:50.574
BiII got voted
"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star"


728
00:44:50.658 --> 00:44:51.783
when he was
in high school.


729
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.244
You suck!

730
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.497
That hasn't
really worked out.


731
00:44:57.707 --> 00:44:58.832
We should be going. . .

732
00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:00.000
Sit.

733
00:45:02.295 --> 00:45:04.337
So, Bill,

734
00:45:05.673 --> 00:45:08.258
Rodrick tells me that you're
a professional musician.


735
00:45:08.342 --> 00:45:11.845
So that means
that you earn enough to make a living?


736
00:45:11.929 --> 00:45:14.180
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

737
00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:18.310
Well, enough if you live
in your parents' basement.


738
00:45:18.853 --> 00:45:20.937
My parents are
really supportive.


739
00:45:21.022 --> 00:45:23.982
Respect your parents,
boys!


740
00:45:24.066 --> 00:45:25.775
Hey! That's what
Joshie says!


741
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.985
Shh!

742
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:28.069
So. . .

743
00:45:29.113 --> 00:45:31.281
lt doesn't sound like a cakewalk, right?
No.


744
00:45:31.365 --> 00:45:32.532
Why don't you
tell Rodrick?


745
00:45:32.617 --> 00:45:35.619
Give him a picture of just how challenging
it can really be.


746
00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:37.704
No, it's really hard.

747
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.082
First of all, there's no home-cooked
meals like this.


748
00:45:41.167 --> 00:45:43.418
What? Really?

749
00:45:43.502 --> 00:45:47.756
Yeah, yeah!
No, on the road, it's all


750
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.676
burgers and fries
and pizza.


751
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:54.888
Then you got to
deal with the fans, especially the girls.


752
00:45:56.015 --> 00:45:59.684
No, it's definitely
not for everyone.


753
00:46:00.519 --> 00:46:01.686
But. . .

754
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:08.568
lf you like rocking
deep into the night and partying hard all day


755
00:46:09.195 --> 00:46:12.155
then it might be the life for you.
lt's definitely for me.


756
00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:13.782
lt does sound fun.

757
00:46:13.908 --> 00:46:16.743
But what if you don't play
a musical instrument?


758
00:46:17.745 --> 00:46:19.954
Lasded Diper
always needs roadies.


759
00:46:20.247 --> 00:46:22.582
So you're
joining the band?


760
00:46:22.667 --> 00:46:24.167
Yeah, brother!

761
00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:26.252
l'm in. Let's rock!
Yeah!


762
00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:40.892
l think l might have
brought too much stuff.


763
00:46:40.976 --> 00:46:43.561
Let's see how many views
our video's got.


764
00:46:43.646 --> 00:46:45.438
lt's got to be thousands.

765
00:46:45.773 --> 00:46:47.065
Maybe millions!

766
00:46:48.275 --> 00:46:51.861
Four? We only got
four lousy hits?


767
00:46:52.488 --> 00:46:56.449
Greg, l can't lie to
your parents about the party. l never lie.


768
00:46:56.534 --> 00:46:58.368
Joshie says
a lie hurts everyone.


769
00:47:00.162 --> 00:47:03.123
Guess who wanted to join
the big boy sleepover!


770
00:47:03.207 --> 00:47:04.374
Bubby, Rowley!

771
00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:05.583
Mom, no,
he'll ruin it!


772
00:47:05.668 --> 00:47:08.294
He just wanted to come in
and say hi to Rowley. All right?


773
00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.548
And Rowley's mother
brought over some healthy snacks


774
00:47:11.632 --> 00:47:14.509
and DVDs
that she thought were appropriate.


775
00:47:15.636 --> 00:47:18.638
Enjoy your
granola bars, boys.


776
00:47:23.686 --> 00:47:27.230
Andy's Magic Cushion.
Let's start with that.


777
00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:32.277
Or should
we watch The Foot?


778
00:47:35.489 --> 00:47:38.199
What if she comes back in
and asks about the party?


779
00:47:38.284 --> 00:47:39.951
You need to relax.

780
00:47:41.495 --> 00:47:42.829
How about
a healthy snack?


781
00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.763
We shouldn't be here.

782
00:47:59.847 --> 00:48:02.307
We can't just let ourselves
into a stranger's home.


783
00:48:02.391 --> 00:48:05.685
The place is empty.
Nobody's going to mind.


784
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:08.730
Oh.

785
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.065
Look at his face.

786
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.153
What happened
to his foot?


787
00:48:21.577 --> 00:48:23.912
It sounded like
someone was hopping.


788
00:48:23.996 --> 00:48:25.955
I'm telling you,
it's nothing.


789
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.957
It's just
your imagination.


790
00:48:30.336 --> 00:48:32.295
Did you just kick me?

791
00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:51.815
You know, you really need
to cut your toenails.


792
00:48:51.899 --> 00:48:53.817
What was that?

793
00:49:04.328 --> 00:49:06.120
Turn it off!
Turn it off!


794
00:49:06.205 --> 00:49:08.248
Okay. Only
'cause you're scared.


795
00:49:11.043 --> 00:49:12.919
Let's just go to sleep.

796
00:49:14.797 --> 00:49:17.757
l wish we had watched
Andy's Magic Cushion.


797
00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:30.061
l love this movie, Frank.
Don't you just love this movie?


798
00:49:32.273 --> 00:49:35.275
He picked the housekeeper
over the supermodel?


799
00:49:36.735 --> 00:49:38.278
l know.

800
00:49:41.323 --> 00:49:43.533
lt's got me!
The foot has got me!


801
00:50:00.801 --> 00:50:05.179
Greg, is there something you want to say to
Rowley and his father?


802
00:50:06.765 --> 00:50:10.059
l'm sorry for choosing
an inappropriate movie for the sleepover.


803
00:50:11.103 --> 00:50:13.229
At least nobody
got hurt this time.


804
00:50:13.314 --> 00:50:16.065
l'm a little birdy.
l'm a little birdy!


805
00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:19.861
My knee bone.

806
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:26.743
What?

807
00:50:35.252 --> 00:50:36.836
Mommy, look.

808
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:40.548
Mommy is looking.
Mommy's looked a thousand times!


809
00:50:41.175 --> 00:50:44.510
Mommy just needs
to go to the potty for one minute, okay?


810
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:47.347
No! No!

811
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.686
What the heck?
Where's the lock?


812
00:50:54.563 --> 00:50:55.688
Wait.

813
00:51:08.702 --> 00:51:11.537
Rodrick, could you
come here, please?


814
00:51:11.997 --> 00:51:14.165
What happened
to the lock?


815
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.125
l don't know what
you're talking about.


816
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:18.211
There was a lock
on this door.


817
00:51:18.295 --> 00:51:20.171
Um. . .

818
00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:21.881
l don't think so.

819
00:51:21.966 --> 00:51:24.550
Rodrick,
l've lived in this house for 10 years.


820
00:51:24.635 --> 00:51:26.469
l've locked that door

821
00:51:26.553 --> 00:51:30.348
because sometimes
it's my only moment of privacy of the day.


822
00:51:30.432 --> 00:51:31.474
l know there was
a lock on that door.


823
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.642
There wasn't.
Trust me.


824
00:51:32.726 --> 00:51:34.894
Greg has walked in
on me a million times.


825
00:51:34.979 --> 00:51:37.397
And if there was a lock,
l would use it.


826
00:51:38.482 --> 00:51:41.067
ln fact, maybe
you should put one on.


827
00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:43.820
So that's your story.

828
00:51:43.904 --> 00:51:47.031
There was never a lock
and you have no idea what l'm talking about.


829
00:51:48.242 --> 00:51:49.826
Yes.

830
00:51:51.078 --> 00:51:54.330
Fine. l'll just
go ask your brother the same thing.


831
00:52:04.174 --> 00:52:06.718
Greg? Two words.

832
00:52:07.928 --> 00:52:11.431
Bathroom door.

833
00:52:18.355 --> 00:52:19.772
lt was Rodrick!
He made me! lt was his idea.


834
00:52:19.857 --> 00:52:22.275
He had the party!
Someone wrote on the door, so we had to change it!


835
00:52:22.359 --> 00:52:24.152
l knew it. l knew it.

836
00:52:24.236 --> 00:52:26.320
No, Mom, wait!
l was exaggerating a little bit.


837
00:52:26.405 --> 00:52:28.406
lt wasn't a party.
lt was a band rehearsal


838
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.866
for the talent show.
That's all it was.


839
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.869
We said nobody could come over.
He knew the rules.


840
00:52:32.953 --> 00:52:34.871
Yeah, but, Mom,
if you punish him,


841
00:52:34.955 --> 00:52:36.372
Rodrick's gonna know
l told on him.


842
00:52:36.457 --> 00:52:40.043
We really had a good time this weekend.
But if you do this,


843
00:52:40.127 --> 00:52:42.712
Rodrick and l will never,
ever be friends again.


844
00:52:43.714 --> 00:52:47.759
The idea that one day
my kids won't get to know their Uncle Rodrick?


845
00:52:47.843 --> 00:52:49.886
Or have any
family holidays?


846
00:52:50.596 --> 00:52:53.139
You two really have been getting along
better this week, haven't you?


847
00:52:53.849 --> 00:52:55.767
Yeah. We really have.

848
00:53:01.857 --> 00:53:03.316
Okay, if. . .

849
00:53:04.985 --> 00:53:07.320
lf l let this slide,

850
00:53:08.822 --> 00:53:12.909
and be our little secret
for the sake of the family,


851
00:53:12.993 --> 00:53:14.744
and for your relationship
with your brother,


852
00:53:14.828 --> 00:53:18.831
do you swear to be
on your best behavior and get along?


853
00:53:19.792 --> 00:53:21.584
l swear. l swear.

854
00:53:25.214 --> 00:53:31.385
Okay.

855
00:53:46.151 --> 00:53:48.694
You didn't buckle.

856
00:53:49.196 --> 00:53:51.197
Deny, deny,
deny, right?


857
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.702
You know. . .

858
00:53:58.205 --> 00:54:02.875
You may not be half as lame
as l thought you were.


859
00:54:06.505 --> 00:54:07.880
I couldn't believe it!

860
00:54:07.965 --> 00:54:10.508
Rodrick was actually
trying to be nice to me.


861
00:54:15.764 --> 00:54:19.642
Wow!
You're a Mom Bucks millionaire!


862
00:54:19.726 --> 00:54:21.644
Where'd you get these?
Thrift shops.


863
00:54:21.728 --> 00:54:24.814
There's enough in here
to last me until l'm 30.


864
00:54:27.025 --> 00:54:32.780
lt's about time, little bro,
that you learn the secrets to an easy life.


865
00:54:33.949 --> 00:54:35.366
Rule number one,

866
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.451
don't be good at something
you don't want to do.


867
00:54:43.876 --> 00:54:47.336
Guys!
Use clean rags, not. . .


868
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:51.716
Just give me that!
l'll do it myself.


869
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.597
Rule number two, always lower Mom
and Dad's expectations.


870
00:55:02.352 --> 00:55:04.937
Hey, l took
a math test today


871
00:55:05.022 --> 00:55:06.689
and l'm pretty sure
l flunked it.


872
00:55:06.773 --> 00:55:07.940
Oh, Greg!

873
00:55:08.025 --> 00:55:11.194
But l got it back,
and look!


874
00:55:11.278 --> 00:55:12.862
l got a C minus.

875
00:55:14.114 --> 00:55:16.407
Well, at least
you didn't fail.


876
00:55:18.952 --> 00:55:21.287
Rule number three,
never do something


877
00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:23.664
when someone else
can do it for you.


878
00:55:25.876 --> 00:55:28.419
"100 Years Ago."
l remember that assignment.


879
00:55:29.129 --> 00:55:30.880
Why write a new one

880
00:55:30.964 --> 00:55:32.840
when there's
a perfectly good paper


881
00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:35.134
already written
by your brother?


882
00:55:37.429 --> 00:55:39.055
lsn't that cheating?

883
00:55:39.139 --> 00:55:41.098
lsn't Mr. Draybick
cheating


884
00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:44.894
by handing out
the same assignment every year?


885
00:55:47.481 --> 00:55:50.816
New binder.
Teachers dig binders.


886
00:55:52.611 --> 00:55:53.861
The thing was,

887
00:55:53.946 --> 00:55:55.905
Rodrick had managed
to get my dad to do


888
00:55:55.989 --> 00:55:58.199
all his homework
for the past five years.


889
00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:00.910
Which one's
the space bar again?


890
00:56:00.994 --> 00:56:03.871
Just let me do it,
okay? Okay.


891
00:56:03.956 --> 00:56:07.291
I would never actually
hand in a paper Rodrick wrote.


892
00:56:07.376 --> 00:56:10.086
But my dad?
That's a different story.


893
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.047
So that's just three of the things
Rodrick has taught me.


894
00:56:13.131 --> 00:56:14.674
He has a lot
of cool tips.


895
00:56:14.758 --> 00:56:17.802
l'm not sure Rodrick's tips
are really that cool.


896
00:56:20.222 --> 00:56:23.015
Okay, so the
invisible Chirag joke is still going,


897
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.142
and the whole school
is in on it.


898
00:56:25.227 --> 00:56:27.770
But it looks like Chirag's
discovered our weakness.


899
00:56:27.854 --> 00:56:29.689
Hello, Greg, Rowley.

900
00:56:29.773 --> 00:56:32.024
Still pretending
l'm invisible, l presume.


901
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:33.651
l don't know
if l can do this.


902
00:56:34.903 --> 00:56:36.946
Stay strong.

903
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.031
What is this?
A corn dog.


904
00:56:39.116 --> 00:56:42.326
Rowley's all-time
favorite lunch delicacy.


905
00:56:42.411 --> 00:56:46.622
lf you say you can see me, Rowley,
it is all yours.


906
00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:51.502
Mmm. Smell that
buttermilk batter.


907
00:56:51.586 --> 00:56:53.087
You got him, Chirag.

908
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:54.213
Resist it.

909
00:56:54.298 --> 00:56:55.298
Don't do it, Rowley.

910
00:56:56.425 --> 00:56:59.176
Hey, everyone, look!
There's a floating corn dog.


911
00:57:07.311 --> 00:57:09.312
I don't want to
get ahead of myself or anything,


912
00:57:09.396 --> 00:57:12.982
but I think I may have
Class Clown in the bag for dreaming this one up.


913
00:57:14.568 --> 00:57:18.154
ln conclusion,
without last century's technological advances,


914
00:57:18.238 --> 00:57:23.743
there would be no computers,
cell phones, or modern medical miracles.


915
00:57:23.827 --> 00:57:27.872
And so for that,
we salute and thank our ancestors


916
00:57:27.956 --> 00:57:29.415
from 100 years ago.

917
00:57:37.215 --> 00:57:40.009
Thank you, Holly.
That was excellent work.


918
00:57:40.093 --> 00:57:42.636
l think we have time
for one more.


919
00:57:42.721 --> 00:57:46.557
l have to say that
when l read this paper


920
00:57:46.641 --> 00:57:48.684
l was a bit surprised
by its content.


921
00:57:48.769 --> 00:57:54.607
But more than any other,
this one deserves to be read out loud.


922
00:57:56.485 --> 00:57:57.568
Greg?

923
00:57:59.946 --> 00:58:01.572
Yay, Greg!

924
00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:15.878
Just read it, Greg.
All of it.


925
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:20.049
Okay.

926
00:58:21.385 --> 00:58:25.554
"Sometimes l sit and wonder
about stuff l do not know


927
00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:29.725
"Like what the Earth
was like 100 years ago


928
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:35.314
"Did cavemen ride on dinosaurs?
Did flowers even grow?


929
00:58:35.399 --> 00:58:40.277
"Did spiders rule the Earth?
Were deserts filled with snow?


930
00:58:40.362 --> 00:58:44.031
"There were no books or humans, so
How were we to know


931
00:58:44.116 --> 00:58:47.159
"What life was
like 100 years ago?"


932
00:58:50.372 --> 00:58:51.497
Loser.

933
00:58:53.834 --> 00:58:58.546
Now, Greg, when we talk
about how important it is to recycle,


934
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.465
we don't mean turning in
your brother's old papers.


935
00:59:08.265 --> 00:59:10.266
l thought Dad helped
you with this paper.


936
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.268
Well, actually,

937
00:59:12.352 --> 00:59:14.854
Dad started writing my papers
because of that paper.


938
00:59:14.938 --> 00:59:16.313
l looked like an idiot!

939
00:59:16.731 --> 00:59:20.151
And the girl from the roller rink?
She laughed at me.


940
00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:21.944
Ouch!

941
00:59:22.154 --> 00:59:25.197
Just do something
that changes her opinion of you.


942
00:59:25.282 --> 00:59:28.159
Like, set a firecracker
off in the classroom. Boom!


943
00:59:28.243 --> 00:59:29.618
Chicks dig bad boys.

944
00:59:29.703 --> 00:59:33.456
Well, actually
l was thinking about writing her a note.


945
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.791
You mean like one
with words on it?


946
00:59:36.001 --> 00:59:37.418
l've got it
all figured out.


947
00:59:37.502 --> 00:59:40.713
I'm gonna pass her a note
with a question on it, but it'll be anonymous.


948
00:59:40.797 --> 00:59:42.965
She'll be like,
"I have to know who wrote this."


949
00:59:43.049 --> 00:59:44.717
Then later,
I'll walk up to her


950
00:59:44.801 --> 00:59:47.094
and ask her
the exact same question.


951
00:59:47.179 --> 00:59:48.762
It'll blow her mind.

952
00:59:48.847 --> 00:59:50.473
A note?

953
00:59:50.557 --> 00:59:52.308
Do you want me
to spell check it?


954
00:59:52.392 --> 00:59:54.226
Just pass it to Holly.

955
00:59:55.437 --> 00:59:56.729
To Holly.

956
01:00:09.576 --> 01:00:10.576
Thank you.

957
01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:16.332
lt's from Greg.

958
01:00:26.176 --> 01:00:27.343
What's going on?

959
01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:30.054
Greg Heffley is
passing me notes!


960
01:00:30.138 --> 01:00:31.764
No, l wasn't.

961
01:00:33.725 --> 01:00:36.644
"How do you get your hair
to smell so beautiful?"


962
01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:58.040
Okay.
The note was a minor setback,


963
01:00:58.124 --> 01:01:00.793
but at least things
are still going well with Rodrick.


964
01:01:00.877 --> 01:01:03.212
It's amazing but
I'm actually enjoying


965
01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:05.756
watching Lasded Diper rehearse
for the talent show.


966
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.259
Bill's taken the band
to a whole new level.


967
01:01:08.343 --> 01:01:10.135
Somebody farted.

968
01:01:13.807 --> 01:01:16.684
l got one. l got one.
l got a good one. l got a good one.


969
01:01:17.769 --> 01:01:19.103
Somebody farted.

970
01:01:24.067 --> 01:01:27.403
My dad should be happy
that I'm hanging out with Rodrick.


971
01:01:27.487 --> 01:01:29.905
But I don't think
he really likes Bill.


972
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:33.075
I think what he's worried about is
l'll turn out like Rodrick,


973
01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:37.079
Manny'll turn out like me,
and, eventually, we'll all turn out like Bill.


974
01:01:37.163 --> 01:01:38.747
Rock and roll!

975
01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:41.083
Rock on.
Yeah.


976
01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:07.776
Dear Greg,
meet me in the art room before lunch.


977
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:11.113
There's something
I want to ask you. Kiss, kiss. Holly.


978
01:02:27.547 --> 01:02:30.299
Hi, Holly!
l was glad to get your note.


979
01:02:30.383 --> 01:02:32.384
l've been wanting
a chance to talk to you.


980
01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:37.890
And, hey, you like to paint.
l'm kind of an artist myself.


981
01:02:40.393 --> 01:02:41.477
Holly?

982
01:02:45.607 --> 01:02:46.607
Ha!

983
01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:48.317
Chirag?

984
01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:53.739
You see me now, don't you?
Game, set and match to Chirag Gupta!


985
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.799
Hi, Holly.
Hi, Fregley.


986
01:03:13.426 --> 01:03:14.677
She thinks
l'm Fregley?


987
01:03:14.803 --> 01:03:16.095
That's got to hurt.

988
01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.269
Want to see
my secret freckle?


989
01:03:24.688 --> 01:03:25.896
Ew!

990
01:03:29.818 --> 01:03:32.945
So the note to the girl
didn't work out?


991
01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:39.702
All right. Let's go.
Little bro, l am taking you out.


992
01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:43.580
And here are
my other men.


993
01:03:43.665 --> 01:03:45.708
Greg, Rodrick,
l'd like you to meet my editors,


994
01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.209
Mr. Salz and Mrs. Kohan.

995
01:03:47.293 --> 01:03:49.712
Hey. Hello.
Nice to meet you. Hello.


996
01:03:49.796 --> 01:03:51.338
Where you boys off to?

997
01:03:51.423 --> 01:03:52.923
Just taking
the little brother out


998
01:03:53.007 --> 01:03:55.050
for the evening.
He could use a good time.


999
01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:57.970
Okay, well, be safe.
And be home by 9:00.


1000
01:03:59.305 --> 01:04:01.348
Yeah. See you!

1001
01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:04.226
Bye.
Bye. Have fun!


1002
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.561
Good night.

1003
01:04:05.645 --> 01:04:08.480
Now that is impressive.

1004
01:04:08.857 --> 01:04:11.817
My older boy
wants nothing to do with his younger brothers.


1005
01:04:11.901 --> 01:04:14.278
You certainly
practice what you preach.


1006
01:04:14.362 --> 01:04:16.613
l think every mother in town
should read your column.


1007
01:04:18.032 --> 01:04:19.032
Thanks.

1008
01:04:28.835 --> 01:04:32.254
Mom would kill us
if she saw us eating this.


1009
01:04:43.141 --> 01:04:45.684
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!


1010
01:04:45.769 --> 01:04:49.605
All l can say is,
get ready to have your mind blown.


1011
01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:52.149
We are going to
have an epic night.


1012
01:04:55.653 --> 01:04:57.154
Are you okay?

1013
01:05:00.867 --> 01:05:03.410
Fake vomit.
You can't beat the classics.


1014
01:05:03.828 --> 01:05:04.912
Yeah.

1015
01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:10.375
Here we go.
Here we go. Here he comes.


1016
01:05:16.424 --> 01:05:20.636
Okay. Very funny!
Very funny.


1017
01:05:24.057 --> 01:05:25.349
This is sweet!

1018
01:05:25.433 --> 01:05:26.725
l told you.

1019
01:05:43.701 --> 01:05:47.955
So, you know that girl
who l sent the note to?


1020
01:05:48.498 --> 01:05:49.706
Yeah?

1021
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.251
She thinks l'm Fregley.

1022
01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:54.586
Oh, man!

1023
01:05:55.505 --> 01:05:58.507
l mean, hey,
don't take it hard.


1024
01:05:58.591 --> 01:06:01.343
Girls act like
they're not into you when they really are.


1025
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:06.849
l mean, tons of girls
act like they're not into me, but they are.


1026
01:06:06.933 --> 01:06:09.852
l know they are.
l bet she really likes you.


1027
01:06:12.438 --> 01:06:14.273
Check it out.
Check it out.


1028
01:06:15.817 --> 01:06:16.817
Whoa!

1029
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:25.659
Who's out there?

1030
01:06:26.953 --> 01:06:28.161
No way.

1031
01:06:28.288 --> 01:06:29.538
Coach Malone?

1032
01:06:29.622 --> 01:06:32.040
Real funny, yeah?
Oh, yeah!


1033
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:35.836
Well, you just messed
with the wrong athlete!


1034
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.129
Move. Move!

1035
01:06:38.673 --> 01:06:40.591
Show yourself!
Go, go!


1036
01:06:41.384 --> 01:06:44.970
You want to take me on? Yeah?
You want to take me on?


1037
01:06:45.054 --> 01:06:47.931
You better bring your A game,
'cause l am a competitor!


1038
01:06:48.016 --> 01:06:49.641
Come on!
You will come out!


1039
01:06:49.726 --> 01:06:51.894
You know l'm going
to find you!


1040
01:06:51.978 --> 01:06:53.020
Help!

1041
01:06:53.104 --> 01:06:54.146
Come on.

1042
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:56.982
Something tickles.

1043
01:07:03.489 --> 01:07:04.781
Come on.
Come on. Come on.


1044
01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:12.664
You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!


1045
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:14.082
Go, go, go, go!

1046
01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:16.293
Everywhere you go,
it's me!


1047
01:07:19.672 --> 01:07:21.548
Stupid carbs!

1048
01:07:22.425 --> 01:07:24.051
There's the mall!
Come on.


1049
01:07:24.427 --> 01:07:25.802
l can't go
much further!


1050
01:07:42.904 --> 01:07:44.279
Got you!

1051
01:07:47.033 --> 01:07:48.575
Coach Malone?

1052
01:08:02.882 --> 01:08:05.676
"You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!"


1053
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.594
"Everywhere you go,
it's me!"


1054
01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.887
Come on.

1055
01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:15.352
Oh, you boys are five minutes early.
Did you have a good time?


1056
01:08:15.436 --> 01:08:16.687
A great time.

1057
01:08:16.771 --> 01:08:18.480
That is so sweet.

1058
01:08:18.564 --> 01:08:20.691
l just can't
get over how well your boys get along.


1059
01:08:20.775 --> 01:08:23.986
Well, Larry,
we run a pretty tight ship around here.


1060
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:26.154
lt's all about
boundaries, rules.


1061
01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:29.366
Anyway, let me show you some of those
Civil War re-enactment photos


1062
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.659
l was telling you about.

1063
01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:32.327
So, what did
you boys do?


1064
01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:35.872
Just hung out
at the mall.


1065
01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:40.168
And talked about life.
Nothing special.


1066
01:08:40.253 --> 01:08:41.253
Oh, my God.

1067
01:08:45.133 --> 01:08:46.550
Rodrick?

1068
01:08:46.634 --> 01:08:49.052
Can you explain
what you're doing in this photo?


1069
01:08:51.431 --> 01:08:52.472
That's not me.

1070
01:08:55.268 --> 01:08:56.435
That's not you?

1071
01:08:56.519 --> 01:08:57.602
Nope.

1072
01:08:57.979 --> 01:09:00.564
Okay. How about these?

1073
01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:19.541
l can't believe
that you had a party!


1074
01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:23.295
Greg, you told me
it was a couple of kids, a band rehearsal!


1075
01:09:23.379 --> 01:09:25.797
Wait, Susan,
you knew about this?


1076
01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:27.507
Yes.

1077
01:09:27.592 --> 01:09:28.717
Yes, l knew.

1078
01:09:28.843 --> 01:09:29.968
You told Mom?

1079
01:09:30.053 --> 01:09:31.553
l knew they
had a party!


1080
01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:33.555
lt slipped out,
but l took it back!


1081
01:09:33.639 --> 01:09:35.182
My instincts told me
you weren't being honest!


1082
01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:36.808
l should've trusted my instincts.
Wait!


1083
01:09:36.893 --> 01:09:39.061
You knew about this,
but you didn't tell me about it?


1084
01:09:39.145 --> 01:09:40.729
l still protected you!

1085
01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:42.147
l threw Mom
off your scent!


1086
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:44.316
Great job.
She has no idea!


1087
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.569
We are supposed
to be a team against them!


1088
01:09:47.653 --> 01:09:49.071
They were getting
along so well


1089
01:09:49.155 --> 01:09:50.572
l let it blind me
to the truth!


1090
01:09:50.656 --> 01:09:52.407
Why were you
taking pictures?


1091
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:55.577
lt was so crazy that morning,
l forgot we took the pictures.


1092
01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:59.372
So l let it slide.
And l am so sorry.


1093
01:09:59.457 --> 01:10:01.541
Oh, God.
lt feels so good to get that out.


1094
01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:05.587
l haven't been able to look
at that bathroom door for two weeks!


1095
01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:07.839
l knew that door
had a lock on it!


1096
01:10:07.924 --> 01:10:11.301
And everybody was trying to make me feel
like l was losing my mind!


1097
01:10:11.385 --> 01:10:13.470
We're just gonna
let ourselves out.


1098
01:10:13.596 --> 01:10:15.680
l wouldn't write
a column about this.


1099
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:23.105
l'm going upstairs!

1100
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:25.398
To a bathroom
that has a lock on it


1101
01:10:25.483 --> 01:10:28.735
and no one can tell me
that it doesn't.


1102
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.406
l have to go talk
to your father.


1103
01:10:35.576 --> 01:10:37.911
l will deal with
you boys later.


1104
01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:43.667
Rodrick, l really
didn't tell her!


1105
01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:47.504
l mean maybe, sort of,
but l made a deal with her,


1106
01:10:47.588 --> 01:10:50.715
and we had a really
good time, and. . .


1107
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.717
You're my brother,

1108
01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:55.637
but you'll never
be my friend.


1109
01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:20.162
Your father and l have talked
and we've decided on your punishment.


1110
01:11:20.246 --> 01:11:23.832
Greg, you're grounded
for two weeks.


1111
01:11:23.916 --> 01:11:26.960
Also, no video games
for two weeks.


1112
01:11:27.837 --> 01:11:31.965
Rodrick, you may only
drive to and from school for the next month.


1113
01:11:32.049 --> 01:11:35.927
As the ringleader,
you are also grounded for a month.


1114
01:11:36.387 --> 01:11:40.015
Mom, l'm sorry,
and l won't do it again.


1115
01:11:40.099 --> 01:11:41.725
l know you won't.

1116
01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:44.936
And to make sure

1117
01:11:46.272 --> 01:11:48.982
we're also not allowing you to
perform in the talent show.


1118
01:11:50.193 --> 01:11:54.321
What? No.
You can't do that.


1119
01:11:54.405 --> 01:11:56.531
Ground me for a year,
l don't care,


1120
01:11:56.824 --> 01:11:58.825
but you have to let me
play in that show.


1121
01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:00.911
This could be my big break.
l'm sorry.


1122
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:04.873
Dad? Come on. This isn't fair.
l just got Bill in the band!


1123
01:12:04.957 --> 01:12:07.918
Actually, Rodrick,
that doesn't help your case.


1124
01:12:08.002 --> 01:12:09.336
Bill's kind of a jerk.

1125
01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.089
Our decision is final.

1126
01:12:21.182 --> 01:12:22.807
You are so dead!

1127
01:12:27.313 --> 01:12:29.606
Things have
never been worse.


1128
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.233
Our parents are
super mad at us,


1129
01:12:31.317 --> 01:12:32.859
so we have to
spend the weekend


1130
01:12:32.985 --> 01:12:36.071
at my grandpa's
boring retirement community.


1131
01:12:36.155 --> 01:12:38.490
Holly Hills thinks
I'm Fregley,


1132
01:12:38.574 --> 01:12:41.368
and my relationship
with Rodrick is at an all-time low.


1133
01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:44.162
So he's made it his mission
to ruin my life.


1134
01:12:45.998 --> 01:12:47.123
Quit it!

1135
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:50.335
Why don't you tell Mom?
You're good at that.


1136
01:12:50.419 --> 01:12:52.420
Grandpa doesn't like TV.

1137
01:12:52.505 --> 01:12:56.258
lnstead, he prefers to watch the lobby
on the security channel.


1138
01:12:56.342 --> 01:12:58.760
l should be
rehearsing right now.


1139
01:12:59.845 --> 01:13:04.057
Please, Grandpa.
Please, can we watch a real TV show now?


1140
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:07.102
TV is just
a bunch of fakers.


1141
01:13:07.186 --> 01:13:09.479
This is real life.

1142
01:13:09.563 --> 01:13:11.606
lt's real life.
You can't beat it.


1143
01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:18.029
How's about we all go down
to the games room?


1144
01:13:18.114 --> 01:13:20.323
You boys like games,
don't you?


1145
01:13:22.368 --> 01:13:23.868
The games room
sounds fun


1146
01:13:23.953 --> 01:13:28.623
until you realize that
all the games in there are from, like, the 1800s.


1147
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:32.836
My grandpa's favorite is a really old board game
called Gutbusters.


1148
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.881
Now, remember, the object of the game
is to read the joke card


1149
01:13:36.966 --> 01:13:40.051
and all the other players
have to try not to laugh.


1150
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.389
Good luck!
There are some real rib-ticklers in there!


1151
01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:46.266
Yeah.

1152
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:47.684
You go first.

1153
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.023
"Putting economic policy
before fiscal responsibility


1154
01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:56.067
"is like putting the cart
before the horse."


1155
01:14:03.117 --> 01:14:06.161
That is hilarious, Grandpa!
Read another one, Greg.


1156
01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:09.414
l'm going to go
change my shirt.


1157
01:14:15.338 --> 01:14:16.421
Hi!

1158
01:14:19.216 --> 01:14:22.177
Oh, hi, Holly.
What are you doing here?


1159
01:14:22.261 --> 01:14:24.721
l'm visiting my grandma.
She just moved here.


1160
01:14:24.805 --> 01:14:27.265
l'm on Grandpa duty.

1161
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:31.102
Listen, Greg,
l'm really sorry for calling you Fregley the other day.


1162
01:14:31.187 --> 01:14:32.437
l don't know
what happened.


1163
01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:35.899
l think it's the Greg and Freg part,
my brain just flipped.


1164
01:14:35.983 --> 01:14:40.195
You called me Fregley?
l had no idea.


1165
01:14:40.279 --> 01:14:41.613
Really?

1166
01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:43.073
Not really.

1167
01:14:43.157 --> 01:14:45.992
l heard it.
lt was pretty rough.


1168
01:14:46.077 --> 01:14:49.120
But don't worry,
l have the rest of middle school to get over it.


1169
01:14:50.664 --> 01:14:52.248
What happened
to your shirt?


1170
01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:55.627
Oh, my brother
spit milk on me.


1171
01:14:55.711 --> 01:14:58.254
Let me guess,
he was pretending to laugh


1172
01:14:58.339 --> 01:15:00.382
at something that
wasn't actually funny.


1173
01:15:00.466 --> 01:15:01.841
How did you know?

1174
01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:03.718
lt's in the
Older Sibling Handbook.


1175
01:15:03.803 --> 01:15:07.305
Last week, my older sister
put hair remover in my shampoo.


1176
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:10.016
lf l hadn't smelled something,
l'd be completely bald by now!


1177
01:15:10.101 --> 01:15:11.768
Why would she do that?

1178
01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:13.895
Duh! 'Cause
she's my sister.


1179
01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:17.649
lt's part of the deal.
You fight and then you get over it.


1180
01:15:18.567 --> 01:15:20.693
Not my brother.
He hates me


1181
01:15:20.778 --> 01:15:22.404
and he'll never
get over it.


1182
01:15:22.488 --> 01:15:25.240
Of course he will.
He has to. He's your brother.


1183
01:15:27.326 --> 01:15:30.412
l also have a little sister
who's spoiled rotten.


1184
01:15:30.496 --> 01:15:32.997
Tell me about it!
My little brother ruins all my stuff,


1185
01:15:33.082 --> 01:15:35.542
and somehow l'm the one
who ends up getting in trouble for it.


1186
01:15:35.626 --> 01:15:37.210
Doesn't that
drive you nuts?


1187
01:15:38.462 --> 01:15:39.462
Holly! Time for dinner!

1188
01:15:39.547 --> 01:15:42.215
l got to go.
lt was cool hanging out with you.


1189
01:15:42.299 --> 01:15:45.093
l'll look for you
tomorrow, Greg.


1190
01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:47.762
See you later,
Fregley.


1191
01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:50.390
I thought
being at Grandpa's was a punishment


1192
01:15:50.474 --> 01:15:54.561
but, really, it was destiny
that Holly was here, too.


1193
01:15:54.645 --> 01:15:56.688
My luck had
finally changed.


1194
01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:18.668
"l've never believed
in fate, or destiny,


1195
01:16:18.752 --> 01:16:20.378
"or whatever, until now.

1196
01:16:20.463 --> 01:16:22.964
"Things are finally
starting to go my way!"


1197
01:16:23.048 --> 01:16:26.342
Rodrick, be quiet.
Talk on the phone someplace else.


1198
01:16:26.427 --> 01:16:28.803
"l thought
being at Grandpa's was a punishment


1199
01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:32.640
"but, really, it was destiny
that Holly was here, too.


1200
01:16:32.725 --> 01:16:35.435
"My luck had
finally changed."


1201
01:16:36.437 --> 01:16:38.062
Aww!

1202
01:16:39.982 --> 01:16:41.316
Give it back,
Rodrick!


1203
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.027
This stuff is priceless!
No way.


1204
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:45.570
Come on.
Give it back!


1205
01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:47.489
You know what?
l will give it back.


1206
01:16:47.573 --> 01:16:50.074
To Holly!
Wait till she reads this garbage!


1207
01:16:53.037 --> 01:16:55.246
I don't even want to go

1208
01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:56.873
"l can't believe my luck!

1209
01:16:56.957 --> 01:16:59.250
"l finally got Holly
all to myself


1210
01:16:59.335 --> 01:17:01.544
"without Chirag,
or anyone else!"


1211
01:17:03.506 --> 01:17:05.215
Give it back, Rodrick!
Give it back.


1212
01:17:05.299 --> 01:17:07.008
No way.

1213
01:17:11.764 --> 01:17:13.890
Always stuck
in a daydream


1214
01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:16.059
Can't focus
on the other team


1215
01:17:16.143 --> 01:17:18.394
Hunted you
all day and night


1216
01:17:18.479 --> 01:17:20.021
Now I'm ready
for a fight


1217
01:17:20.105 --> 01:17:21.773
This is war

1218
01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.442
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1219
01:17:24.527 --> 01:17:29.197
This is war

1220
01:17:29.782 --> 01:17:31.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1221
01:17:31.617 --> 01:17:33.117
This is war

1222
01:17:36.455 --> 01:17:38.915
'Cause I got
to knock you out


1223
01:17:41.418 --> 01:17:42.418
Whoop!

1224
01:17:47.216 --> 01:17:48.216
Oh!

1225
01:17:58.143 --> 01:17:59.978
They say that
you're the best


1226
01:18:00.062 --> 01:18:01.646
You gotta follow
all the rest


1227
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.439
This is war

1228
01:18:04.191 --> 01:18:06.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1229
01:18:06.652 --> 01:18:08.403
Record, record, record.

1230
01:18:08.737 --> 01:18:10.655
This is war

1231
01:18:11.407 --> 01:18:13.074
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1232
01:18:13.158 --> 01:18:15.076
This is war

1233
01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.620
I can't be your friend

1234
01:18:17.705 --> 01:18:20.123
'Cause I gotta
knock you out


1235
01:18:36.223 --> 01:18:37.890
l'm in the ladies'?

1236
01:18:57.036 --> 01:19:00.622
Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom in there!


1237
01:19:00.706 --> 01:19:04.500
Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom in there!


1238
01:19:04.585 --> 01:19:06.502
Let's get him!

1239
01:19:06.587 --> 01:19:11.966
What do you think you are doing in there?
We'll come in and get you!


1240
01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:13.593
Take that,
you Peeping Tom!


1241
01:19:13.677 --> 01:19:15.178
Let's get him!

1242
01:19:15.262 --> 01:19:17.388
Get out of here!

1243
01:19:17.514 --> 01:19:19.599
Stop that pervert!

1244
01:19:19.683 --> 01:19:22.310
The little whippersnapper!

1245
01:19:22.394 --> 01:19:25.188
l've got him!
l've got him!


1246
01:19:25.272 --> 01:19:26.773
Shame on you!

1247
01:19:26.857 --> 01:19:28.900
l've got him
in a headlock!


1248
01:19:30.402 --> 01:19:33.112
l'm not the Peeping Tom!

1249
01:19:33.197 --> 01:19:34.197
Where'd he go?

1250
01:19:38.994 --> 01:19:40.870
Did he just come out
of the ladies' room?


1251
01:19:48.379 --> 01:19:49.837
Hey, Greg!

1252
01:19:50.881 --> 01:19:52.715
What's new? Huh?

1253
01:19:55.594 --> 01:19:57.887
Well, my life
is officially over.


1254
01:19:57.971 --> 01:19:59.722
Now that Rodrick
has that tape of me


1255
01:19:59.807 --> 01:20:01.683
running around
in my underwear,


1256
01:20:01.767 --> 01:20:03.685
he basically owns me.

1257
01:20:05.729 --> 01:20:07.605
The day of
the talent show came around


1258
01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:10.149
and Mom and Dad
made us both go.


1259
01:20:10.234 --> 01:20:13.611
Something about supporting
the community, or whatever.


1260
01:20:13.696 --> 01:20:15.321
Scotty!

1261
01:20:16.448 --> 01:20:17.865
Come on!

1262
01:20:18.826 --> 01:20:20.368
Scotty! Come on!

1263
01:20:20.452 --> 01:20:22.662
You don't wanna let
the magic fans down, do you?


1264
01:20:22.746 --> 01:20:23.871
Go away!

1265
01:20:23.956 --> 01:20:25.665
Rowley, what's wrong?

1266
01:20:25.749 --> 01:20:28.209
My assistant, Scotty,
got stage fright


1267
01:20:28.293 --> 01:20:29.877
and now he doesn't
want to do the show.


1268
01:20:29.962 --> 01:20:33.381
Maybe Greg would help out.
He can be your assistant.


1269
01:20:33.465 --> 01:20:36.092
What? No way!

1270
01:20:36.176 --> 01:20:38.469
What? Rowley is
your best friend.


1271
01:20:38.554 --> 01:20:40.138
This is important to him.
You need to do this.


1272
01:20:40.222 --> 01:20:42.306
lt's okay,
Mrs. Heffley.


1273
01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:45.101
Greg is just afraid
that Holly Hills will think less of him.


1274
01:20:45.185 --> 01:20:46.561
Rowley.

1275
01:20:46.645 --> 01:20:50.064
Mom, can we talk in private?
Sure.


1276
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:51.816
Scotty, please.

1277
01:20:53.944 --> 01:20:56.195
Look. . .
Who's this Holly Hills?


1278
01:20:56.321 --> 01:20:57.405
ls she your girlfriend?
No!


1279
01:20:57.489 --> 01:21:00.032
She's just some girl
who happens to be a friend


1280
01:21:00.117 --> 01:21:02.076
who l don't want
to be humiliated in front of.


1281
01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:04.287
l see your point.

1282
01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:05.580
So is this Holly
in your class?


1283
01:21:05.664 --> 01:21:06.748
Mom!

1284
01:21:06.832 --> 01:21:08.124
Okay.

1285
01:21:08.917 --> 01:21:10.084
Here we go.

1286
01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:12.336
So, are you going
to make me do it?


1287
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:14.964
Please, Scotty.

1288
01:21:15.048 --> 01:21:17.884
No. No, l get it.
l get it.


1289
01:21:19.344 --> 01:21:20.470
Can you at least
point her out to me?


1290
01:21:21.555 --> 01:21:23.598
Okay, okay, l'll stop.

1291
01:21:30.731 --> 01:21:33.858
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,


1292
01:21:33.942 --> 01:21:37.862
welcome to Plainview's
Most Talented!


1293
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:44.619
And without further ado,
Ms. Patty Farrell!


1294
01:21:56.048 --> 01:22:02.637
Memory
All alone in the moonlight


1295
01:22:02.721 --> 01:22:06.766
I can smile
at the old days


1296
01:22:06.892 --> 01:22:10.770
I was beautiful then

1297
01:22:10.854 --> 01:22:12.313
Wow, she's really good.

1298
01:22:12.397 --> 01:22:15.233
I remember the time

1299
01:22:15.317 --> 01:22:19.987
I knew
what happiness was


1300
01:22:20.072 --> 01:22:26.994
Let the memory live again

1301
01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:30.373
Touch me

1302
01:22:30.457 --> 01:22:34.335
It's so easy to leave me

1303
01:22:34.419 --> 01:22:38.297
All alone with the memory

1304
01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:42.093
Of my days in the sun

1305
01:22:42.761 --> 01:22:46.097
If you touch me...

1306
01:22:46.181 --> 01:22:48.641
Greg, she's cute.

1307
01:22:48.725 --> 01:22:50.017
She's super cute.

1308
01:22:50.102 --> 01:22:51.394
Mom!

1309
01:22:51.937 --> 01:22:56.691
Look, a new day

1310
01:22:56.775 --> 01:23:02.488
Has begun

1311
01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:08.953
Oh, thank you!

1312
01:23:16.169 --> 01:23:18.588
Say hello to
the boys and girls, Freggers.


1313
01:23:18.672 --> 01:23:21.883
Hello, boys and girls!
l love you.


1314
01:23:21.967 --> 01:23:25.761
And tonight,
when you are all fast asleep


1315
01:23:25.846 --> 01:23:31.559
l'm going to crawl through your window
and give you all a big hug!


1316
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:48.743
Hey, you could
do that. Right?


1317
01:23:48.827 --> 01:23:49.994
Yeah.

1318
01:23:53.624 --> 01:23:57.835
A real live nephew
of my Uncle Sam


1319
01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.505
I was born on
the 4th of July


1320
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:05.676
I've got a
Yankee Doodle sweetheart


1321
01:24:05.761 --> 01:24:09.555
She's my
Yankee Doodle joy


1322
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:11.724
Yankee doodle came to...

1323
01:24:13.477 --> 01:24:16.938
You can't go on without me.
l started Lasded Diper. l'm the backbone!


1324
01:24:17.022 --> 01:24:20.650
Well, we got a new
backbone now, dude.


1325
01:24:20.734 --> 01:24:22.735
This guy.

1326
01:24:22.819 --> 01:24:25.279
That's rock
and roll, bro.


1327
01:24:27.574 --> 01:24:31.702
Did you guys see the audience?
Oh, man! lt's huge.


1328
01:24:36.458 --> 01:24:39.377
This roller-skating
kid is really good!


1329
01:24:39.461 --> 01:24:41.963
Don't you think. . .

1330
01:24:47.636 --> 01:24:50.972
Greg! Where have you been?
l've been looking all over for you.


1331
01:24:51.056 --> 01:24:54.350
Mom, you need to
let Rodrick play in the talent show tonight.


1332
01:24:54.434 --> 01:24:57.436
Greg, we've been over this.
He needs to learn a lesson.


1333
01:24:57.521 --> 01:25:00.147
His band is playing without him,
and it's not fair.


1334
01:25:00.232 --> 01:25:01.816
And l'm sure that's
very hard on him,


1335
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.901
but l can't go back
on the punishment.


1336
01:25:05.195 --> 01:25:06.779
Mom.
Yes?


1337
01:25:09.074 --> 01:25:12.326
You let Rodrick play
in the talent show,


1338
01:25:13.328 --> 01:25:14.620
l'll. . .

1339
01:25:16.498 --> 01:25:18.165
. . .do the magic thing
with Rowley.


1340
01:25:20.002 --> 01:25:23.421
Really?
You'd do that?


1341
01:25:25.924 --> 01:25:27.633
You'll be Rowley's partner,
even though you said


1342
01:25:27.718 --> 01:25:31.053
it's totally embarrassing
and humiliating?


1343
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:34.765
You're willing to do that
just so your brother can play?


1344
01:25:38.145 --> 01:25:39.228
Yes.

1345
01:25:43.108 --> 01:25:44.483
Come here.

1346
01:25:50.282 --> 01:25:53.284
l mean,
how bad can it be?


1347
01:26:04.046 --> 01:26:05.337
Scotty was right.

1348
01:26:05.422 --> 01:26:06.839
There's a lot of
people out there.


1349
01:26:06.923 --> 01:26:10.885
Just start with
your opening trick, like you rehearsed at home.


1350
01:26:10.969 --> 01:26:14.138
Forget about
all the people. Go.


1351
01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.064
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


1352
01:26:23.148 --> 01:26:28.694
l am the Remarkable Rowley,
master of illusion.


1353
01:26:29.988 --> 01:26:35.659
And joining me onstage is
my faithful assistant, Scotty.


1354
01:26:35.744 --> 01:26:37.203
Greg!

1355
01:26:38.246 --> 01:26:39.538
Greg.

1356
01:26:40.415 --> 01:26:44.585
Who looks a little cold.
Maybe he needs a scarf.


1357
01:26:54.679 --> 01:26:57.056
Ew! Don't put them on me!
They're still wet!


1358
01:27:01.561 --> 01:27:04.355
Sorry, Greg.
Here's a peace offering.


1359
01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:14.657
Fly. Fly away.
Be free, little friend.


1360
01:27:16.368 --> 01:27:17.368
Oh. Oh.

1361
01:27:19.871 --> 01:27:21.455
That thing's dead.

1362
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.958
l think l had him
in my pocket too long.


1363
01:27:25.961 --> 01:27:27.962
No hard feelings?

1364
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:48.732
Keep going.
We're a hit!


1365
01:27:48.859 --> 01:27:53.154
And now,
for my grand finale,


1366
01:27:53.238 --> 01:27:56.365
the saw-the-lady-in-half
trick!


1367
01:27:58.869 --> 01:28:00.244
lf you will.

1368
01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.750
Push out the feet.
Okay.


1369
01:28:08.503 --> 01:28:12.506
No trap doors.
No chance of escape.


1370
01:28:13.842 --> 01:28:17.553
l will now miraculously
saw Greg in half.


1371
01:28:18.555 --> 01:28:20.764
Wait. Forget it!
l want out!


1372
01:28:23.226 --> 01:28:24.351
What are you doing?

1373
01:28:24.436 --> 01:28:25.519
This is the showstopper!

1374
01:28:25.604 --> 01:28:27.438
Good, then stop!

1375
01:28:30.233 --> 01:28:31.901
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1376
01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:36.989
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Remarkable Rowley!


1377
01:28:38.575 --> 01:28:41.118
And Greg the Great!

1378
01:28:43.622 --> 01:28:45.748
That should
have been me!


1379
01:28:53.882 --> 01:28:56.050
We killed.
And l didn't have to die!


1380
01:28:56.134 --> 01:28:58.636
lt was even better
than it was in the rehearsals.


1381
01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.803
Hi.
Can l have your autograph?


1382
01:28:59.888 --> 01:29:00.930
Sure. Sure.

1383
01:29:01.014 --> 01:29:03.641
Your performance was pathetic,
Greg Heffley!


1384
01:29:03.725 --> 01:29:06.602
Only a moron
would find humor in bird poop!


1385
01:29:10.023 --> 01:29:11.440
