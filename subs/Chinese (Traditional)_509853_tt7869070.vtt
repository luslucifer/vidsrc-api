我把脖子贴在你的身上
I put my neck on the line for you,


190
00:14:47.904 --> 00:14:50.838
这样你就可以继续你那怪异的小爱好了
so that you could continue with your freaky little hobby


191
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.907
收集像孩子一样的亲笔签名
collecting autographs like a child,


192
00:14:52.909 --> 00:14:55.576
这就是你如何报答我的？表现得像个疯子？
and this is how you repay me? By acting like a maniac?


193
00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.646
“疯子” 这是一部很棒的电影不是糟糕的翻拍
"Maniac", that's a great movie. Not the crappy remake.


194
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.915
那被高估了这是我喜欢的新款
That was overrated. It's the new one I like.


195

- 请勿更改主题 - 是的 它......
- Don't change the subject. - It was, it...


196
00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:06.421
利亚 是阿曼达把我踢出去了
It was Amanda who got me kicked out, Leah.


197
00:15:06.423 --> 00:15:08.356
她是一个庆祝者
She was the one being a celebutard.


198
00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:09.957
好吧 没关系 穆斯 好吗？
Well, it doesn't matter, Moose, OK?


199
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:12.660
因为我必须支付租金 而这台相机就是我这样做的
Because I have to pay the rent, and this camera is how I do it.


200
00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.062
如果你不能尊重
If you can't respect that,


201
00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:16.064
那是我为你做的最后一件事
then this is the last favor I'm ever doing for you.


202
00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:18.533
亨特·邓巴昨晚甚至不在场
Hunter Dunbar wasn't even there last night.


203
00:15:18.535 --> 00:15:20.802
你答应他会在那里
You promised that he'd be there.


204
00:15:21.938 --> 00:15:25.440
不要......抬起你的声音
Do not... raise... your voice at me.


205
00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:27.308
不好看 穆斯
Not a good look, Moose.


206
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.078
我可以做我想做的事你不是我的妈妈
I can do what I want. You're not my mom.


207
00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:55.171
那是歇斯底里的

208
00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:57.705
那是歇斯底里的
That was hysterical.


209
00:15:57.705 --> 00:15:58.005
That was hysterical.

210
00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:08.015
胡说！

00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:49.376
有一天 你需要学习
One day, you're gonna need to learn


535

如何为自己挺身而出

536
00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:54.214
你将不得不学习如何反击
You're gonna have to learn how to fight back.


537

538
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:57.684
我迟到了
I'm late.


539
00:33:57.684 --> 00:33:57.686
I'm late.

540
00:33:57.686 --> 00:33:57.984
我得走了
I'm late.


541
00:33:57.984 --> 00:33:57.986
我得走了

542
00:33:57.986 --> 00:34:00.086
我得走了
I've got to go.


543
00:34:06.228 --> 00:34:07.761
我不知道
'I have no idea


544
00:34:07.763 --> 00:34:11.531
为什么穆斯会回到那个男人的家里
'why Moose would go back to that man's house.


545
00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:16.002
但我想当你找到饼干罐时......
But I suppose when you find the cookie jar...


546
00:34:17.339 --> 00:34:20.173
很难不再回头了
it's hard to not go back for more.


547
00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:05.986
我做的我做的
I did it. I did it.


548
00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:23.570
亨特·邓巴为什么会让这个死？
Why would Hunter Dunbar let this die?


549
00:35:23.572 --> 00:35:26.172
嘿!
Hey!


550
00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:29.042

00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:31.645
离开这里！
Get out of here!


552
00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:56.102
你在做什么？你试图让我心脏病发作？
What are you doing? You trying to give me a heart attack?


553

554
00:35:57.704 --> 00:35:57.706
Of course not.

555
00:35:57.706 --> 00:35:57.904
你不能只是偷偷摸摸那样的人 穆斯
Of course not.


556
00:35:57.904 --> 00:35:57.906
你不能只是偷偷摸摸那样的人 穆斯

557
00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:00.173
你不能只是偷偷摸摸那样的人 穆斯
You can't just sneak up on people like that, Moose.


558
00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:02.842
我几乎有一个康拉德霍尔走出地球酒吧的镜头
I almost had a shot of Conrad Hall walking outta Earth Bar.


559
00:36:02.844 --> 00:36:05.312
地球酒吧很糟糕 - 没有奶昔
Earth Bar sucks - no milkshakes.


560
00:36:05.314 --> 00:36:08.148
是的 好吧 你最好的朋友亨特邓巴的联合主演
Yeah, well, your best friend Hunter Dunbar's co-star,


561
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.216
泰德女士 早些时候走了出去
Ms. Title, walked out of there earlier


562
00:36:10.218 --> 00:36:13.720
并且用透明的衬衫祝福我 没有胸罩
and blessed me with a see-through blouse, no bra.


563
00:36:13.722 --> 00:36:16.289
你提到邓巴很有趣
It's funny that you mention Dunbar.


564

因为我就在他家

565
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:21.428
- 你在开玩笑 对吧？ - 不
- You're kidding, right? - Nope.

带你直接去他家和...

568
00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:29.669
他的植物 他应该更好地照顾他的植物
His plants, he should take better care of his plants.


569
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:32.672
我没有告诉你使用星图应用程序
I did not tell you to use the Star Map app.


570
00:36:32.674 --> 00:36:34.808

我告诉过你这个应用程序
I told you about the app


572
00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:38.411
因为你是我认识的最大的电影迷 我想
because you are the biggest movie fan I know, and I thought


573
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:40.213
你会看到明星居住的地方
you'd get a kick out of seeing where the stars live.


574
00:36:40.215 --> 00:36:42.415
你不能只是侵犯人们的隐私
You cannot just invade people's privacy.


575
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:44.317
利亚 我没有遇到麻烦

穆斯 这真的很糟糕
Moose, this is really bad.


578
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:51.758
我不敢相信你的表现就像这样
I can't believe you're acting like this.


579

我以为你会为我感到高兴
I thought you'd be happy for me.


580
00:36:53.562 --> 00:36:55.462
为你感到高兴？
Happy for you?


581
00:36:55.464 --> 00:36:57.163
我从来没有鼓励过你
I would have never encouraged you


582
00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:59.199
如果我知道你会变成一个令人毛骨悚然的小缠扰者
if I knew you'd turn into a creepy little stalker.


583
00:36:59.201 --> 00:37:04.204
我不是跟踪者莉莉 我是粉丝！
I am not a stalker. I am a fan, Leah!


584
00:37:04.206 --> 00:37:07.040
你应该比任何人都更清楚
You should know that better than anybody.


585
00:37:07.042 --> 00:37:10.076
你是如此卑鄙像亨特的妻子一样
You're being so mean. Like Hunter's wife.


586
00:37:10.579 --> 00:37:12.746

Give you what you need, easy. I go on in 15. Alright?


595
00:37:38.607 --> 00:37:40.173
我可以教你如何喧嚣
I can teach you how to hustle.


596
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:42.842
我真的......我需要现金 穆斯 以一种糟糕的方式
And I really... I need the cash, Moose, in a bad way.


597
00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:45.545

- 对你来说有什么关系？ - 我不是这样做的 托德！
- What does it matter to you? - I'm not doing it, Todd!


599
00:37:49.151 --> 00:37:51.785
别管我别管我
Just leave me alone. Just leave me alone.


600
00:37:51.787 --> 00:37:54.754
别管我别管我

你没有得到你想要的球
You don't have the balls to get what you want.


603
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.027
好的？我在这里得到了一个惊人的商机
Alright? I got an amazing business opportunity here

我认为没有人是白痴

你对恐怖图片一无所知
you don't know anything about horror pictures.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:29.220
它不是......它还不错这不是一种享受
It's not... It's not bad. It just isn't a treat.


1000
01:08:29.222 --> 01:08:31.556
我想丹尼会长大后恨你
I think Danny's gonna grow up hating you.


1001
01:08:31.558 --> 01:08:32.824
不要谈论我的儿子

1002
01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:35.260
冰箱里根本没有冰淇淋

但他们需要品尝美味的食物

1010
01:08:51.678 --> 01:08:53.077
然后恐怖图片

1011
01:08:53.079 --> 01:08:56.681
- 他会记住这个 - 我会买冰淇淋 好吗？
- He's gonna remember this. - I'll get ice cream, OK?

当然可以
Of course you can.


1016
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:12.096
你会让我陷入困境
You're gonna get me in trouble.


1017
01:09:12.098 --> 01:09:13.765
没有
No.


1018
01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:17.669
- 你会伤到我吗？ - 不 我不会这样做
- Are you gonna hurt me? - No. I won't do that.


1019
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:25.009
我知道你是个好人
I know you're a good person.


1020
01:09:29.249 --> 01:09:34.619
我似乎很卑鄙......生气......

1021
01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:37.789
但我只是害怕 伙计我只是...

我也知道你也是
And I know you are, too.


1024
01:09:52.572 --> 01:09:54.405
你害怕吗？
You scared?


1025
01:09:56.876 --> 01:09:58.810
你只想离开 对吧？
You just wanna leave, right?


1026
01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:03.151
那没关系 伙计没关系
That's alright, man. That's OK.


1027
01:10:03.151 --> 01:10:03.154
我不会报警

这是你和我之间的承诺

- 没有警察？ - 没有警察
That's alright, man. That's OK.


1030
01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:05.683
- 没有警察 - 在那之后...
That's alright, man. That's OK.


1031
01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.729
这感觉不太好
This doesn't feel good.


1032
01:10:20.066 --> 01:10:23.167
听我说 好吗？
Hear me out, OK?


1033
