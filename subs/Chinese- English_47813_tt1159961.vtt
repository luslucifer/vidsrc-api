2
00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.352
埃尔顿•约翰到松林制片厂的时间是…
Elton John, up at Pinewood on--


3
00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:13.190
- 什么时候来着? - 12号
- What's the date? - The 12th of--


4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.592
3月12号
Twelfth of March.


5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.167
这里是20… 30帧分轨中心
It's me, split track, 20-- Thirty-frame center track.


6
00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.394
就是这个调
There's the tone.


7
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.433
请安静
Quiet, please.


8
00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:41.707
1984-1994十年间，一场融天时地利人和的完美风暴
彻底改变了整个动画行业的面貌


9
00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:45.020
开始
Here we go.


10
00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:51.609
埃尔顿·约翰爵士

11
00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.382
那是1994年的春天
It was the spring of 1994


12
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:55.033
我们即将完成狮子王的制作
and we were just finishing The Lion King,


13
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.729
这部电影好评如潮
which would go on to earn great reviews


14
00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:00.604
并赚取了7.5亿美元的票房
and about three-quarters of a billion dollars at the box office.


15
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:03.577
对迪斯尼的新员工来说 这是个好消息
Not bad for a group of artists who were kicked off the Disney lot


16
00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:07.547
该片也算是挽回了2D动画江河日下的颓势
and an art form that was given up for dead just ten years earlier.


17
00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:14.249
我是狮子王的制片人
I produced The Lion King


18
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.951
当时, 剧组人员即将举行首发见面会
and the cast-and-crew premiere was coming up fast.


19
00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:20.789
按照惯例, 大家会逐一登台致感谢词
It was tradition for all of us to get up on-stage and give warm thank-you speeches.


20
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:24.697
这一次, 我决定把致谢演讲拍下来
But this time I decided to film all the speeches instead.


21
00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.837
开始拍了?
You are rolling?


22
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.939
- 是的 - 好
- Yeah. - Okay.


23
00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:36.610
在公司的各项业务中, 很明显…
With all the many varied businesses this company is in, it is clear--


24
00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:38.584
迈克尔·埃斯纳
迪斯尼公司CEO


25
00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:41.274
动画将日渐成为我们的灵魂与核心
It becomes clearer every day that animation is its soul, heart,


26
00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.910
是我们的主体业务
and most of its body parts.


27
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.418
过去这些年, 你们表现得很出色
You guys have done an unbelievable job over the last decade,


28
00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:53.237
完成了佳作狮子王, 推动了公司发展
culminating in Lion King, in pushing forward the company,


29
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.391
彰显了文化的魅力与艺术的气质
the culture and the quality of artistry.


30
00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:01.698
我要代表我本人, 公司董事会, 股东, 以及我的孩子
Congratulations from me, from anybody who is not on this tape,


31
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.966
向你们表示祝贺
from our board, our shareholders and my children.


32
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:06.166
恭喜大家
Congratulations.


33
00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:08.308
谢谢 谢谢大家
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.


34
00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:12.279
感谢大家奉献的精彩作品
Thank you to everybody for another absolutely incredible job


35
00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:15.509
希望能再接再厉, 再创辉煌
on another marvelous movie on the way to the next great movie.


36
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:17.517
外界看来, 这一切都很完美
To an outsider, it looked like a perfect world.


37
00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:19.019
但是在幕后
But backstage,


38
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.884
气氛已十分紧张
the tension had reached a peak.


39
00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:22.082
谢谢, 可以了吗?
Thank you. Okay?


40
00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:25.993
尽管我们刚取得了前所未有的成功
Even though it was the moment of our greatest success,


41
00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.893
但已经是山雨欲来风满楼了
the wheels were coming off the car.


42
00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:31.830
下面我来细讲故事的来龙去脉
This is the story of how we got there.


43
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:36.751
片名：唤醒睡美人

44
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.368
让我们回到80年代初期
Let's back up to the early '80s


45
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.537
加州伯班克市的迪斯尼制片场
on the Disney Studio lot in Burbank, California.


46
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.616
我们的乐队正向同事们传递着假日的喜悦
The animation band is spreading its holiday cheer to the employees


47
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.379
一如既往, 主奏乐器是班卓琴和单簧琴
with banjos and jew's harps, as was the tradition.


48
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:52.407
右边这个人就是我
And that's me on the right,


49
00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:54.513
正用贝斯弹着铃儿响叮当
trying to play"Jingle Bells" On the bass.


50
00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:57.525
与同龄人一样, 我是看着迪斯尼电影长大的
Like so many of us, I grew up on a diet of Disney films.


51
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.390
每过四年, 我就会像朝圣一样
And every four years, I'd make a pilgrimage


52
00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.158
奔向露天影院一睹迪斯尼最新大作的风采
to the drive-in theater to see their latest animated masterpiece.


53
00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.164
20岁时, 我在迪斯尼工作室觅得一份差事
When I was 20, I got a job at the studio


54
00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.633
负责给动画制作人端茶送水
delivering artwork and coffee to the animators


55
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.797
为此我已感觉欣喜若狂
and I felt like I won the lottery.


56
00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.073
这就是沃特建的房子
This was the house that Walt built.


57
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.340
沃特•迪斯尼, 好莱坞骄子, 打造迪斯尼乐园的天才
Walt Disney, the toast of Hollywood, the genius behind Disneyland


58
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.917
还制作了第一部动画电影: 白雪公主
and the producer behind the first animated feature, Snow White.


59
00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:25.920
到了五十年代, 沃特渐渐失去了对动画的兴趣
By the 1950s, Walt was losing interest in animation


60
00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:28.388
更多地开始关注真人电影
and his attention turned to live-action films,


61
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:29.992
新兴的电视媒体
the new medium of television,


62
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.424
首座迪斯尼主题公园的建设
and building the first theme park, Disneyland,


63
00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.928
而且计划着未来都市的图景
and planning futuristic cities of tomorrow.


64
00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:38.692
目前为止, 我们佛罗里达计划最重要的部分
By far, the most important part of our Florida Project,


65
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:42.100
也是迪斯尼世界的核心内容
in fact, the heart of everything we'll be doing in Disney World,


66
00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:47.369
将是我们的“明日世界实验原型”, 即“未来世界”
will be our Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow, Epcot.


67
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.403
沃特1966年去世
Walt died in 1966,


68
00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:52.982
但迪斯尼仍在为孩子们制作着天真烂漫的卡通片
but the studio still made sweet, harmless, animated comedies for kids,


69
00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:57.553
监制人是一群大师级动画制作人, 被称为“九长老”
supervised by his master animators, the Nine Old Men,


70
00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:01.453
出品人是沃特的女婿, 工作室头号人物罗恩•米勒
and produced by Walt's son-in-law, studio head Ron Miller.


71
00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:05.755
我是兰迪•卡特莱特, 这是罗恩•米勒
I'm Randy Cartwright and this is Ron Miller.


72
00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:07.021
兰迪, 你好啊, 很高兴见到你
Randy! How are you? Good to see you.


73
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.758
这是兰迪, 电影开了个好头
This is Randy. Great way to start the film.


74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.199
- 这是… 你的第一支广告吗?  - 没错
- Is this a new--? Your first commercial? - Ha, ha. Yup.


75
00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.395
拍这个干嘛?
What is this for?


76
00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.301
- 家庭电影而已 - 纪录片
- Just home movie. - It's a documentary.


77
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.671
关于工作室的纪录片
Documentary of the animation studio.


78
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.505
妈妈, 你好
Hi, Mom.


79
00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:27.143
很好, 开了个好头
Well, we're off to a good start.


80
00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:30.719
现在是1980年4月9日
Here it is, April 9th, 1980.


81
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.789
我们要去采访大家了
This is the past to all you folks out there.


82
00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:38.326
我们马上进去, 看看大家在干嘛, 跟我来
And we're gonna go inside and see what it's like. Come on.


83
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.827
不知为何, 迪斯尼公司大楼的走道里
For some reason, the halls of the Disney Animation building


84
00:04:40.964 --> 00:04:44.559
总是弥漫着冷却器, 铅笔屑和旧油毡的味道
always smelled faintly of swamp coolers and pencil shavings and old linoleum.


85
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.760
这就是臭名昭著的老鼠窝
This is the infamous Rat's Nest.


86
00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:50.134
动画长期以来都是在这样的地方制作
Animation had been in this slow downward spiral for a long time,


87
00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:52.138
沃特在世时就一直这样
even since Walt Disney was alive.


88
00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:56.659
老一辈退休后, 加州艺术学院的年轻毕业生
As veteran animators retired, new kids, mostly from the Disney-sponsored school,


89
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.879
开始挑起工作室大梁
CalArts, filled the hallways.


90
00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:00.175
鲁本, 你也是加艺毕业的吧
Why, Ruben, you're from CalArts also.


91
00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:01.908
没错, 你是哪位?
Right. And who are you?


92
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.143
- 我? - 没错
- Me? - Yes.


93
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:04.344
我是约翰•雷斯特
I'm John Lasseter.


94
00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:06.512
他是个摄像的, 马上就会走
He's the cameraman. He's leaving in a little while.


95
00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.556
要看看我的动画吗?
Could I show you animation?


96
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:11.023
- 要看看我的动画吗? - 这就是动画
- Could I show you animation? - This is animation.


97
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:12.924
我翻些东西给你看
Could I flip something for you?


98
00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.963
就是这个, 看好了, 彼得•潘
This is it. Look at that. Peter Pan.


99
00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.693
看着…
Oh, looks up and...


100
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:21.201
这比我们今天做的还精彩
It's better than the magic we're making today,


101
00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:23.532
但我们也做不了什么
but we can't help that.


102
00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:30.608
我们是一群精力过剩, 需要发泄的人
We were full of a lot of pent-up youthful creative energy that had to go somewhere,


103
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:35.184
而发泄渠道通常是: 长时间的午餐, 排球
so it was channeled into things like long lunches, volleyball games,


104
00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:37.213
年度讽刺漫画展
the annual caricature show,


105
00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.145
以及我最爱的
and my perennial favorite,


106
00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:42.954
艾迪•费舍和桃乐思•黛的假日秀
the holiday show that starred Eddie Fisher and Doris Day, for some unknown reason.


107
00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:50.027
这是我们的动画师罗恩•克莱门茨
This is one of our animators here. This is Ron Clements.


108
00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:53.602
他正在制作狐狸与猎狗中关于寡妇的场景
He's working on a scene of the Widow from The Fox and the Hound.


109
00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:58.173
- 不可思议, 这位是约翰•马斯克 - 谢谢, 谢谢
- Magically, here is Mr. John-ald Musker. - Thank you, thank you.


110
00:05:58.308 --> 00:06:00.902
他也是我们工作室的动画师
Another animator here at the magic factory.


111
00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:02.605
这是格兰•基恩
This is Glen Keane.


112
00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:04.042
他是一名指导动画师
He is a directing animator.


113
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.479
我早上8点就来了
I've been here since 8:00 this morning.


114
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.312
嘿, 蒂姆, 这是蒂姆•伯顿
Hi, Tim. This is Tim Burton,


115
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.114
也是我们的同事
another one of our people here.


116
00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:15.053
罗恩•米勒清楚动画师的职业生涯不长
Ron Miller knew that Walt's guys were retiring fast.


117
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.945
所以他必须不断启用新人
He had to raise a new crop of animators,


118
00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:18.217
同时也必须小心谨慎
but he was cautious about it.


119
00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:19.658
五年前的一件事令他大为光火
He got burned five years earlier


120
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.630
当时他满怀信任地把动画部交给唐•布鲁斯主管
when he entrusted a charismatic animator named Don Bluth to lead the department.


121
00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.927
但布鲁斯这个人争议很大
But Bluth polarized the animators.


122
00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.505
崇拜者奉他为行业救世主
Some adored him as the messiah of animation and others...


123
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.131
反对者则视其为自大狂
Well, others thought he was just another Walt wannabe.


124
00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:37.809
讽刺的是, 布鲁斯自己也对公司动画部失去了信心
lronically, Bluth himself became disillusioned with the studio's Animation Department.


125
00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:40.711
所以, 他在1979年生日时, 选择了辞职
So on his birthday in 1979, he resigned


126
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.445
而且, 他带走了一半的动画师, 另立门户
and took half the animators with him to start his own studio.


127
00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:48.822
这场变故让狐狸与猎狗延期半年完成
The bombshell set back the release of The Fox and the Hound by six months


128
00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.155
米勒和整个工作室就这样惨遭背叛
and left Miller and the studio betrayed.


129
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.763
当时迪斯尼存在着有趣的隔代现象
It was this interesting cross-generational thing


130
00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:58.800
一边是老一辈的传奇动画师
where you still had a few of these legendary Disney artists


131
00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:01.904
他们年逾花甲, 即将退休
who were now in their sixties and approaching retirement


132
00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:05.132
另一边则是一群二十来岁的年轻人
and then a bunch of young people in their twenties


133
00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:10.144
他们对动画充满了简单真挚的激情与热爱
who were really, really excited and sort of passionate about this medium.


134
00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:14.014
前辈的悉心教导当然很好
It was thrilling to learn from the masters.


135
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.694
但大家总觉得
But there was a feeling like


136
00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:18.177
我们可以做出更好的作品
that somehow we could be making better films.


137
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:20.221
当时, 公司做了一份调查
Around that time, the studio did a survey


138
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:23.325
发现很大部分青少年观影者
that revealed a majority of teenage moviegoers


139
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.620
对迪斯尼影片表示厌恶
wouldn't be caught dead near a Disney movie.


140
00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:30.859
我们就这样等待, 希望变革来临
We were just waiting, waiting for something, anything to happen.


141
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.432
周一, 我们报道了迪斯尼工作室
On Monday, we reported that Walt Disney Studios


142
00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:34.939
正面临财务困境
was on shaky financial ground,


143
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.629
因为其表现乏力的电影业务
because of its troubled Film Division


144
00:07:36.773 --> 00:07:39.037
以及盈利不佳的未来世界项目
and weak earnings from the Epcot Center in Florida.


145
00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:42.076
然而, 之后事态发生了戏剧性的变化
However, since that report, there have been dramatic developments.


146
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:45.476
短短的四日内, 迪斯尼股价飙升了16%
In just four days, Disney stock jumped 16 percent,


147
00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:47.845
达到每股58美元的高价
topping off at around $58 a share.


148
00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.077
分析人士为该事件给出两点解释
Analysts attribute the jump to two factors.


149
00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.086
美人鱼 - 一部融合曼哈顿与童话的青春喜剧片
Splash, the youth-oriented comedy about a mermaid in Manhattan,


150
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:57.522
以上映三天600万的票房震惊了电影界
stunned Hollywood by racking up over $6 million in its opening three days.


151
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.754
它成为了迪斯尼吸金最快的电影
That's the best opening for any movie in Disney's history.


152
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.799
另一大意外, 是罗伊•迪斯尼辞去董事长职务
Another surprise, the resignation of Roy E. Disney as chairman of the board.


153
00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.923
他是沃特的侄子, 是沃特弟弟所生
He's Walt's nephew and son of Walt's brother,


154
00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:08.028
也是公司创始人之一
the company's co-founder.


155
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.332
公司真正的业务中心, 曾经是
The real heartbeat of this company was,


156
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.576
现在是, 将来也永远是电影
is and will always be the film business.


157
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.737
因为电影是一切创意的源泉
Because from the film business comes the ideas


158
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.340
这些创意可以应用到主题公园中
that then generate new things in the parks.


159
00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.112
可以推动新的营销, 新的…
New promotions, new--


160
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:29.190
总之就是公司保持新鲜生命的源动力
A kind of a sense of continuing newness about the company in general.


161
00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:32.089
当我们电影做得不好时
And when that began to fail--


162
00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:35.082
我们就会开始渐渐
And I actually, somewhere along the line,


163
00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:36.892
听到流言蜚语
began hearing things like,


164
00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.797
“我看, 他们根本就无心做电影了,
"Well, I don't think they really wanna stay in the movie business,


165
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:43.702
拍得总是马马虎虎, 我们也根本不想看了
because it's not doing very well and we don't really even need it anyway."


166
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.539
这些话令我很苦恼, 因为我…
And that gave me all sorts of problems, because I, you know--


167
00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.051
我记得有人说
I remember saying at one point,


168
00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:51.647
“如果你真那么想,
"Well, if you really think that way,


169
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.646
那你就真的离电影太远了。”
then what you're doing is running a museum."


170
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.784
人们嘲讽罗伊为“沃特的笨侄子”
People always talked about Roy as the idiot nephew.


171
00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:58.216
“笨侄子”成了他的绰号
That was his nickname.


172
00:08:58.354 --> 00:09:00.584
而事实并非如此
Nothing could be really further from the truth.


173
00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:03.715
他聪明, 谦逊且雷厉风行
He was smart, unassuming and powerful.


174
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.762
你很容易低估他
You could easily underestimate him,


175
00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:07.557
但低估他是很危险的
but you did so at your own peril.


176
00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:09.437
1984年
In 1984,


177
00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:12.597
专做蓄意收购的索尔•斯坦伯格盯上了迪斯尼
the corporate raider Saul Steinberg turned his sights on Disney.


178
00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:14.334
他扬言要买下整家公司
He threatened to buy the company,


179
00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:16.466
然后分拆出售获利
break it up and sell the parts for a profit.


180
00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.484
作为回应, 迪斯尼董事会决定
The board countered by paying


181
00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:21.270
高价回购斯坦伯格所持股票
Steinberg a premium to buy back his shares.


182
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.935
迪斯尼被耍了
It was greenmail.


183
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.945
多年后, 罗伊和他表弟罗恩•米勒
For years, Roy and his cousin-in-law, Ron Miller,


184
00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:28.710
在董事局会议上相向而坐
sat across the boardroom table.


185
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:30.478
他们为一件事争执不下
And now the two were at odds with


186
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.384
那就是董事会当年对威胁收购的处理
how the board was handling the takeover threat.


187
00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:34.859
会议最后得出结论
And we finally came to the conclusion


188
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.482
我们身在局内, 别无选择
that we can't do anything on the inside,


189
00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:41.529
虽然我反对, 但毕竟孤掌难鸣
because I'm the lone voice of dissent on this board.


190
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:45.725
所以我选择向董事会请辞
So I resigned from the board of directors.


191
00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:48.530
我的辞呈引起了很多关注
And it got enormous amounts of attention.


192
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:52.698
第二天早上, 我收到了
I had a stack the next morning of phone messages


193
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.140
无数的电话留言
that probably was three, four inches deep.


194
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:58.577
其中一条来自迈克尔•埃斯纳
One of the messages in that stack was Eisner.


195
00:09:58.714 --> 00:10:01.282
他差不多在事件发生一年多前加入董事会
And I had known Michael because he'd come maybe a


196
00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:03.277
那之前, 我就在艺术学院里认识他了
year before that on to the board at CalArts.


197
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:05.944
迈克尔不是商科出身, 他是英语专业的
Michael wasn't an M.B.A. He was an English major.


198
00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:07.147
他在纽约长大
He grew up in New York,


199
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.401
早年的工作
where one of his first jobs


200
00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:10.726
是为电视台制作儿童节目
was programming kids' television for ABC.


201
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.727
他在派拉蒙工作期间取得过骄人的业绩
And Michael had an amazing track record coming from Paramount.


202
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.822
参与过奥斯卡获奖影片《母女情深》的制作
He'd had hits, Oscar nominations, Terms of Endearment.


203
00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:22.063
他接手迪斯尼时, 正春风得意
He was a winner when he was hired to come in and run Disney.


204
00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:26.230
但他有时也会把事情搞砸
He also was a man who liked to blow things up.


205
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.786
是弗兰克•威尔斯建议罗伊
It was Frank Wells that gave


206
00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:30.004
让迈克尔担任董事局主席
Roy the idea of making Michael the chairman.


207
00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:31.050
弗兰克与罗伊
Frank and Roy were


208
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.411
早年在波莫纳大学是同班同学
classmates at Pomona College in the early '50s.


209
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.819
我觉得弗兰克更像个精明的商人
I thought, you know, Frank's more of a businessman


210
00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.819
迈克尔则学究气重些
and Michael is a little nuts.


211
00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:41.975
他们两人的组合
And the two together kind of


212
00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:45.292
让我想起沃特和我父亲
in some ways made me think of Walt and my dad.


213
00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:49.489
于是我们想知道, “你们二人打算怎么做?”
So we began saying, "How would you two like to take this job?"


214
00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:52.692
迪斯尼王国管理层进行了变动重组
There's been a management shake-up in the Magic Kingdom of Disney.


215
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.303
两位好莱坞高管被举荐
Two Hollywood studio executives have been chosen


216
00:10:55.438 --> 00:10:57.133
掌管迪斯尼公司
to run Walt Disney Productions,


217
00:10:57.273 --> 00:11:00.140
这是迪斯尼第一次由外人担任最高层
the first time outsiders have been brought in at the top.


218
00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:04.511
迪斯尼董事会推选来自派拉蒙的迈克尔•埃斯纳为主席
The Disney board of directors chose Michael Eisner of Paramount Pictures as chairman,


219
00:11:04.647 --> 00:11:07.639
以及华纳兄弟的弗兰克•威尔斯为首席运营官
and Frank Wells of Warner Bros. As chief operating officer.


220
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:10.881
新晋管理层的第一要务
The first goal, really, of new management


221
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.287
就是认真地重振电影业务
is gonna be getting back in the movie business in a very serious way,


222
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.358
不能马马虎虎, 拍完了事
in the sense of not only just making movies,


223
00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:19.324
要有新的想法和创意
but coming up with new ideas.


224
00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:22.195
二人的组合确实让公司变得与众不同
Their partnership really made the company special.


225
00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:24.856
人们看来, 迈克尔行事鲁莽
There was this perception that Michael was a shoot-from-the-hip,


226
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.229
为人不拘小节
back-of-the-napkin kind of guy,


227
00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:29.167
弗兰克则工整细致, 井井有条
and Frank was very organized and ran things in an orderly manner.


228
00:11:29.872 --> 00:11:31.546
但很多时候, 事实恰恰相反
But in many ways, it was the opposite.


229
00:11:31.547 --> 00:11:33.000
迈克尔更为正常理性
Michael was kind of the sane one.


230
00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:35.337
而弗兰克常做些出格疯狂的事
And Frank, he did bold and crazy things,


231
00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:38.140
比如横渡海洋, 攀登世界各大著名山峰
like swimming oceans, climbing the great summits of the world


232
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.682
甚至于半夜三点打电话问人高飞的本名
and calling at 3 a.M. To ask what Goofy's original name was.


233
00:11:41.817 --> 00:11:45.583
我们欢迎迪斯尼的登山勇士, 弗兰克•威尔斯
Please welcome my mountain-climbing Disney teammate, Frank Wells.


234
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:48.155
这次员工论坛让我明白
I figured out from this employee forum what the difference is


235
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.657
首席执行官(CEO)与首席运营官(COO)的区别
between chief operating officer and chief executive officer.


236
00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:53.353
COO负责完成一些危险动作
Chief operating officer is in charge of doing dangerous things,


237
00:11:53.496 --> 00:11:56.056
比如说我就要吊在钢丝上跟小叮当一起飞
like when I have to fly here with Tinker Bell on a tiny wire.


238
00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:58.667
CEO, 则负责搞笑
Chief executive officer, he's in charge of funny.


239
00:11:58.801 --> 00:11:59.995
弗兰克?
Frank?


240
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.831
嘿, 迈克尔
Hi, Michael.


241
00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:09.745
1984年我回到公司
I came back to the company in 1984


242
00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:13.178
有些漫不经心地对迈克尔说
and, rather cavalier way at the time, said to Michael,


243
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.477
“为何不让我来掌管动画部
"Why don't you let me have the Animation Department,


244
00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:17.408
因为我现在是很珍贵的
because I may be the only guy right now,


245
00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:19.019
新人们不断加入以后
with all these new people coming in,


246
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.522
熟悉整个流程, 又认识大部分人的, 恐怕只有我了
who at least understands the process and knows most of the people."


247
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.422
当时的制作工艺正逐渐被淘汰
The state of the art at that moment was kind of waning


248
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:30.089
工作室对老式工艺也不是特别依赖
and the enthusiasm of the studio itself towards it had not been real strong.


249
00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:32.724
所以我有些关心这个问题
So I just felt a little protective about it.


250
00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:36.394
我来到约翰•马斯克的办公室
And I was in John Musker's office.


251
00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:38.063
记得之后史蒂夫•休利特走进来
And I think it was Steve Hulett came in


252
00:12:38.207 --> 00:12:41.267
告诉我们罗恩•米勒辞职了
with the memo saying that Ron Miller had resigned.


253
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.278
我们都很震惊, 一时难以接受
And we were shocked and it was a huge bombshell to go off.


254
00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:47.211
但我心里明白, 这是个大好消息
But I thought it was, you know, terrific news,


255
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.625
这可能意味着
that maybe it meant that things


256
00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:50.478
工作室要往好的方向发展
were gonna actually get better at the studio.


257
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.356
约翰应该跟我想的一样
And John, I think, felt the same way.


258
00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:53.953
他看起来非常高兴
He seemed pretty excited about it.


259
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.856
而罗恩则有些忧伤地说
But Ron was worried, in a sort of melancholy mood, said,


260
00:12:57.994 --> 00:12:59.791
“永远不要高兴得太早”
"It could always get worse."


261
00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:01.556
这是一次来自好莱坞的入侵
It was an invasion from Hollywood.


262
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:04.325
停车场排满了宝马和保时捷
The parking lot was jammed with BMWs and Porsches.


263
00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:06.958
我记得装修工拆的那些墙
And I remember interior decorators tearing down walls


264
00:13:07.103 --> 00:13:09.663
是1939年后, 就不曾变过的
that hadn't been touched since 1939.


265
00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:13.002
全新的贝伯地毯取代了使用多年的油毡
New Berber carpeting replaced decades-old linoleum.


266
00:13:13.142 --> 00:13:15.110
我不知道油毡有什么不好的
I couldn't figure out what's wrong with linoleum.


267
00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:17.303
要知道, 沃特•迪斯尼当年就走在那油毡上
I mean, Walt Disney walked on that linoleum.


268
00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:19.778
甚至连零食贩卖机也被拆了
Even the snack machines were being torn out.


269
00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:21.849
再见, 售货机
Goodbye, vending machines.


270
00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:24.748
当时, 我还不擅长跟好莱坞打交道
I had no experience with Hollywood at that time.


271
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:29.449
之前跟我打交道的都是和蔼的老一辈
My experience was with kindly old men with cardigan sweaters.


272
00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:32.322
他们通常心平气和, 慈眉善目
And they would sit around and pat you on the back.


273
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:34.393
现在的这帮家伙
And here's these guys hollering


274
00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:37.262
则是口无遮拦, 脏话连篇
foul language in the middle of story meetings.


275
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.062
这像一泼冷水, 突然把我惊醒
And a splash of cold water, suddenly a wake-up to reality.


276
00:13:40.202 --> 00:13:42.295
把我带回现实
You're in the real world here.


277
00:13:42.972 --> 00:13:44.405
大家好, 我是迈克尔•埃斯纳
Hello. I'm Michael Eisner.


278
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.531
欢迎来到迪斯尼周日电影秀
And welcome to The Disney Sunday Movie.


279
00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:50.407
迈克尔•埃斯纳是迪斯尼那一批人中
Michael Eisner is the irreverent kid from the Disney generation


280
00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:52.514
最不守规矩的
who has taken over the toy store.


281
00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:55.382
迪斯尼也让他变得家财万贯
The money alone is right out of Fantasyland.


282
00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.784
他的薪酬和股份价值千万美元
His salary and stock options are worth tens of millions of dollars.


283
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.152
在迪斯尼周日电影秀中
He may look every inch the company chairman


284
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.419
他可能看起来一本正经
when he is taping the introduction to The Disney Sunday Night Movie.


285
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:09.622
但实际上, 他是所有人中玩得最开心的
But in fact, he's having more fun than any other boy on the block.


286
00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:11.665
瞧, 米奇, 我们的朋友也来了
Look, Mickey. Some of our friends are coming.


287
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:13.098
嘿, 米妮
Hey, Minnie.


288
00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:15.430
迈克尔上任CEO后的第一步
So one of the first things that Michael did as CEO


289
00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:18.301
就是将他派拉蒙的旧部杰弗里•卡岑伯格招入麾下
was to bring in Jeffrey Katzenberg, his colleague from Paramount,


290
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.103
让他掌管迪斯尼的电影部
to run the Film Division of Disney.


291
00:14:21.243 --> 00:14:23.177
杰弗里早年在纽约从政
Jeffrey got his start in New York politics,


292
00:14:23.312 --> 00:14:25.712
担任市长约翰•林赛的幕僚
working in the office of Mayor John Lindsay,


293
00:14:25.848 --> 00:14:29.409
当时大家给他的绰号是“狂小子”
where his affectionate nickname was Squirt.


294
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.144
在派拉蒙电影公司
At Paramount Pictures,


295
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.085
他在迪勒和埃斯纳的阴影下发展
he studied in the shadow of Barry Diller and Michael Eisner.


296
00:14:34.223 --> 00:14:38.023
在那里, 人们给他的外号是“金毛猎犬”
And there his nickname was the Golden Retriever.


297
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.650
在迪斯尼, 他不再有绰号了
At Disney, he really had no nickname,


298
00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:42.696
因为在这里, 他这可以走出他人的阴影
because this was the place where he could step out of the shadows


299
00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:44.493
在好莱坞闯出自己的事业
and make his mark on Hollywood.


300
00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:45.998
在派拉蒙时, 我就注意到他了
I sought him out at Paramount.


301
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.467
共事过程中, 我发现他优秀极了
We'd worked together. He was just fantastic.


302
00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:51.596
他很勤奋, 有担当, 有所执迷
He was a worker. He was committed. He was obsessed.


303
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.231
他擅长交际
He made relationships.


304
00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:56.777
一旦我们发现优秀的人才, 他就会设法进行拉拢
If we found somebody good, he would lasso him into our company.


305
00:14:56.912 --> 00:14:57.943
他在派拉蒙这么做
He did it at Paramount


306
00:14:57.944 --> 00:15:00.006
在迪斯尼也是, 而且做得很好
and he did it at Disney and he did it great.


307
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:04.711
我一直记得来到迪斯尼的第一天
So I always remember my first day at Disney when I showed up


308
00:15:04.854 --> 00:15:07.118
我走进迈克尔的办公室, 他说
and I went to Michael's office and he said,


309
00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:08.814
“过来, 我给你看点东西”
"Come here, I wanna show you something."


310
00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.722
我走过去, 他正看着窗外
And I walked over and he was looking out his window.


311
00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:13.453
从他站的位置
And, you know, from his corner,


312
00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:16.861
他指向窗外的七彩大楼
he pointed down to the Ink and Paint building.


313
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.933
问道 你知道他们在里面做什么吗
He said, "Do you know what they do down there?"


314
00:15:19.068 --> 00:15:20.126
我说 不知道
And I said,"No."


315
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:22.464
他说 那是他们制作动画电影的地方
He said,"That's where they make the animated movies."


316
00:15:22.605 --> 00:15:23.949
我说 是吗? 他答道 是的
I went,"Really?" He said,"Yes."


317
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.597
他又说 现在这归你管了
And he said,"And that's your problem."


318
00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:29.874
第一次意见分歧发生在一部备受瞩目的电影上
The first culture clash happened on a much-anticipated film


319
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.503
这部电影制作期长, 投资巨大
that was years in the making and millions over budget,


320
00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:33.706
片名为: 黑神锅传奇
The Black Cauldron.


321
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.817
他不知所措, 他上窜下跳
He's overwhelmed. He'd be jumping up and down.


322
00:15:37.653 --> 00:15:41.180
年轻组员很不耐烦, 急于展现他们的点子
The younger guys were really impatient and anxious to show what they could do,


323
00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:44.625
他们觉得保守的老一辈拖了后腿
but they felt like they were being held back by the remnants of the old guard.


324
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:46.376
而年长的组员则认为
While the older guys thought


325
00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:48.460
这帮小子乳臭未干, 应该安分点
the kids were brats and should get back to work.


326
00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:52.863
黑神锅传奇这部电影, 我们从五本书开始
In the case of The Black Cauldron, we started with five books


327
00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:54.765
把它们浓缩到一本
and had to condense them down into one.


328
00:15:54.904 --> 00:15:57.099
我到岗后的前几个星期
In the first couple of weeks I was at the studio,


329
00:15:57.239 --> 00:15:59.639
观看了黑神锅传奇
I saw The Black Cauldron.


330
00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:03.336
这是部黑暗而棘手的片子
It was a very dark movie and a very troubled movie.


331
00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:07.813
实在是太, 太, 太暴力恐怖了
"This is just way, way, way too violent and too scary.


332
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.578
必须要做一些删减
You have to edit some of these things out."


333
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:12.812
他们说, 你不能删减动画电影
They said, "Well, you can't edit an animated movie."


334
00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:16.083
我说, 当然可以。而他们说, 不, 不可以的
I said,"Well, of course you can." And they said,"No, you can't."


335
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.522
嘿, 不行, 别这样
Hey. No, you don't.


336
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.757
可能你会觉得我在挑起内部矛盾
Honestly, you would think that I was causing World War Three at the studio,


337
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:24.764
因为我确实说过, 你们把片子送到剪辑室
because I literally said,"Well, you get the film and bring it to an edit bay


338
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.095
我来教你们如何删减动画片
and I'm gonna show you how you edit an animated movie."


339
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.294
我认真的
I mean it.


340
00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:32.334
杰弗里亲力亲为, 强硬霸道
Jeffrey was hands-on, elbows-on, sharp elbows-on.


341
00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:35.205
你永远猜不透他的喜怒
You never knew if he was gonna hug you or kick you.


342
00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:37.583
一次接受采访时, 他说道
He said in an interview around that time,


343
00:16:37.584 --> 00:16:39.713
我们要唤醒睡美人
"We've got to wake up Sleeping Beauty."


344
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:42.409
黑魔神的制片人乔•黑尔听后很生气
Then Joe Hale, the producer of The Black Cauldron, was furious.


345
00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:46.214
他们以为自己是谁?他说, 睡美人明明已经醒了
"Who are these guys?"He said. "Sleeping Beauty is awake."


346
00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:48.789
不久后, 他被炒了
He was fired not long after.


347
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.484
黑魔神耗资4400万美元
Black Cauldron cost $44 million to make


348
00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:53.857
票房收入却只及投资一半
and made less than half that at the box office.


349
00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:56.464
更加耻辱和伤人的是
And, to add insult to injury,


350
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.727
它的票房还不如爱心熊的电影
it was beat out at the box office by The Care Bears Movie.


351
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.967
那一刻, 迪斯尼动画发展跌入谷底
That day, Disney Animation hit bottom.


352
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.473
又见到罗恩•克莱门茨了
This is Ron Clements again.


353
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.272
讲讲贝克街的巴兹尔这部电影吧
Explain a little bit about Basil of Baker Street.


354
00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:14.815
这部电影讲了一只老鼠的故事
Well, Basil of Baker Street is about a little mouse


355
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.282
他有点像福尔摩斯
that is just like Sherlock Holmes.


356
00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.547
刚开始罗伊给我们安排了一项任务
One of the first things Roy did was he arranged one day


357
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:25.319
就是浏览整个电影的故事板
for us to be pitched the storyboards for the entire movie.


358
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:29.261
好像动画片就应该这么做
It's like going back to what animation really is supposed to be.


359
00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:32.458
那三个小时时间里
And for the better part of three hours,


360
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:37.868
我们一张张看完了整部电影的故事板
literally the entire movie was pitched to us.


361
00:17:38.007 --> 00:17:40.134
你看完一张, 接着看下一张
You go through one storyboard, then they bring another


362
00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.800
坐在那好几个小时
and you'd sit there for hours and--


363
00:17:41.944 --> 00:17:45.937
我都不记得第一张故事板的内容
I couldn't remember what was in the first storyboard.


364
00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:47.946
这对我来说有些困难
It was a very hard process for me to deal with.


365
00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.051
因为我主要负责的是剧本方面
I'd been used to dealing in the script area.


366
00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:52.050
我们看完后, 都如释重负, 说道
So when it was over, we all sort of said,


367
00:17:52.187 --> 00:17:54.052
非常感谢, 做得好
"Thanks very much," And,"Great job."


368
00:17:54.189 --> 00:17:56.521
迈克尔说, 跟我一起回办公室
And Michael said, "Walk back to my office with me."


369
00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.593
我们往回, 走到办公室
So we walked back. On the way back to the office,


370
00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:00.957
他问, 你觉得怎么样?我说, 不知道
he said,"What do you think?" I said,"L have no idea."


371
00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:04.098
他说, 我也是
And he said,"Neither do I."


372
00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:06.098
我说, 这样吧
I said,"Well, here's the thing.


373
00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:07.444
我们有175名员工
We have 175 people and


374
00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:09.864
我们每天付给他们工钱
we're paying them every day to come to work.


375
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:11.744
工资反正是要发的
And we're gonna pay them


376
00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:13.657
无论他们做不做这片子
whether they make this movie or they don't make this movie,


377
00:18:13.658 --> 00:18:15.604
所以我们还是做比较好
so I guess we probably ought to make the movie."


378
00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:18.474
然后他说, 我也是这么想的
And he says to me, "Well, that's exactly my feeling too."


379
00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:21.208
真人电影发展很快, 杰弗里需要更多办公场地
The live-action business was booming and Jeffrey needed offices


380
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.839
给他的新晋明星
for his new stable of stars,


381
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.808
比如贝蒂•米德勒和罗宾•威廉姆斯
like Bette Midler and Robin Williams.


382
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.485
他决定占用动画部的办公楼
He wanted the animation building.


383
00:18:27.623 --> 00:18:29.921
消息从动画部头儿罗伊•迪斯尼处传下来
The news came down from the head of animation, Roy Disney,


384
00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:31.686
他通知动画部的员工
announcing that the animators would have


385
00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:33.727
必须搬出该办公楼
to move out of the building and off the lot.


386
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:35.394
这到底怎么回事?
What was going on here? I mean,


387
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.625
要知道这栋楼
this was the building where


388
00:18:36.626 --> 00:18:38.329
可是沃特•迪斯尼制作灰姑娘和小飞侠的地方
Walt Disney made Cinderella and Peter Pan,


389
00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:39.900
就这样腾出来给别人?
and we were having to vacate?


390
00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.400
整个决定只能参考一份备忘录
All there was was this memo.


391
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.732
没有会议, 没有辩论, 只有一份备忘录
There was no meeting, no debate, just a memo.


392
00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:46.305
貌似罗伊也不想做过多解释
I guess Roy didn't want the confrontation.


393
00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:49.070
离开那天, 两百名不安的员工
On our last day, 200 frightened people,


394
00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.180
昔日辉煌的迪斯尼动画工作室的残兵剩将
the remnants of Disney's once great Animation Studio,


395
00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:54.509
聚集在老动画部大楼前
gathered on the steps of the old Animation building


396
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.983
留下最后一张合影
for one last photo before we left.


397
00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:01.348
之后我们搬到了新办公楼
So to carry that forward into the new building,


398
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.118
坐落于格兰岱尔市, 选址马马虎虎
which was in Glendale, not a great area,


399
00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:08.093
建筑就基本上是一些简陋可怜的房子
but the building itself was such a gutted wretch of a building,


400
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.652
用空心砖砌起来
with just cinder block


401
00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:12.496
铺着破烂的地毯, 外围有铁丝网
and torn-up carpet and barbed wire around it


402
00:19:12.635 --> 00:19:16.332
肮脏的小车库满是碎酒瓶子
and broken bottles on the crummy little parking lot.


403
00:19:16.472 --> 00:19:18.997
爱德, 这几天都在忙什么?
So, Ed, what are you doing nowadays?


404
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:20.870
我就对着桌子发发呆
I'm just emotionally under my desk.


405
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.638
我们都认定一周之内就要卷铺盖走人
Well, we were all pretty sure that we'd be fired in a week or so,


406
00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:26.771
所以决定为迪斯尼动画来一次特别的庆祝
so we decided to celebrate the apparent end of Disney Animation


407
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:30.248
那就是全景再现电影现代启示录
with a full-scale reenactment of Apocalypse Now.


408
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:48.802
我们没有长长的黑走廊了, 现在都是小隔间
We don't have long dark hallways anymore. We got cubicles.


409
00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:52.168
办公区采用了开放的设计, 你无处躲藏
The warehouse was an open plan, so you couldn't really hide.


410
00:19:52.307 --> 00:19:55.174
大家随时可以进行即兴的交流
It opened the place to frequent and spontaneous communications


411
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.073
无论是在过道, 还是洗手间
in the hallways, in the men's room.


412
00:19:57.212 --> 00:19:58.270
来吧, 过来
Come on in. Come on.


413
00:19:58.414 --> 00:19:59.642
很多从此屏障被打破了
The barriers were down.


414
00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:03.174
搬迁后, 杰弗里召集全体动画师开会
After the move, Jeffrey called a meeting of all the animators,


415
00:20:03.318 --> 00:20:05.684
大家可以发问和表达意见
so the crew could air their questions and concerns.


416
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:07.948
杰弗里站起来, 说: 拿出你们最尖锐的问题
So Jeffrey got up and said, "Give me your best shot.


417
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.346
别给我留面子
Hit me in the solar plexus.


418
00:20:09.347 --> 00:20:11.116
随便问, 我脸皮厚得很
Ask me anything. I've got rhino skin."


419
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.634
有人便问道
And somebody piped up and said,


420
00:20:12.635 --> 00:20:14.252
你简直不知道自己在做什么
"We don't think you know what you're doing."


421
00:20:14.396 --> 00:20:16.762
我回答到: 听着, 我就在这, 哪儿也不去
And I said, "Look, I'm here. I'm not going away.


422
00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.689
而且我很乐意
And I'm more than happy to


423
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.927
与你们相处, 向你们学习
learn and take the time and be educated by you.


424
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:25.802
但没办法, 我们最近的几部动画片
The fact is that the last couple of animated movies made


425
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:27.533
都做得不尽如人意
were not particularly good."


426
00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:30.008
动画部会议开得很频繁
The animation meetings were usually scheduled,


427
00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:33.308
不仅频繁, 而且时间是早上6点
a lot of times, at 6:00 in the morning.


428
00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:37.882
所以, 我还记得早起开车去开会的情形
And so, yeah, I remember driving to go to those meetings.


429
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.581
会场气氛通常有些奇怪
And then that sort of strange atmosphere at that time of the morning,


430
00:20:41.724 --> 00:20:43.885
大家都一副睡眼惺忪的样子
and hardly anyone is awake or around.


431
00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:47.826
后来他开始召集大家周日早上8点开会
He began calling meetings for 8:00 in the morning on Sunday.


432
00:20:47.963 --> 00:20:52.127
记得第二次参加的时候, 我受不了了
And I think it was about the second one, I was just angry.


433
00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:55.168
因为这简直是一种人格侮辱
Because it's just such a total sign of disrespect


434
00:20:55.304 --> 00:20:58.569
把一群才华横溢的员工当苦力使唤
for a lot of very talented people who are working their ass off for you.


435
00:20:58.707 --> 00:21:02.438
所以我说, 杰弗里, 我们得改个时间开会
And I said,"Jeffrey, we gotta have these meetings at some other time,


436
00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:06.207
我跟你说, 如果你再弄这么早
because I promise you, if you have another one of these things at 8 a.M.,


437
00:21:06.582 --> 00:21:09.312
我就穿着睡衣过来
I'm showing up in my pajamas."


438
00:21:10.486 --> 00:21:12.052
您感到骄傲吗, 迪斯尼先生?
Aren't you proud of it, Mr. Disney?


439
00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:13.978
何止骄傲, 我简直要膨胀了
Why, I'm so proud, I think I'll bust.


440
00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:15.750
时间差不多是…
I think it was right around the time of--


441
00:21:15.891 --> 00:21:18.189
奥斯卡颁奖那会儿… 就是那个时候
The Oscars were-- It was just around the corner.


442
00:21:18.327 --> 00:21:21.728
他说, 我对奥斯卡奖不感兴趣
And he said,"You know, I'm not interested in the Academy Awards.


443
00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:25.561
我只对钱感兴趣
I'm interested in the Bank of America awards," You know.


444
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.396
我只在乎能赚多少钱
"What the money these things pull in."


445
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.294
他这个观点
And it was just absolutely


446
00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:32.473
是艺术工作者们最反感的
the worst thing to tell a room full of artists.


447
00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:35.042
这令他们大失所望
It was so discouraging.


448
00:21:37.212 --> 00:21:39.009
一天, 杰弗里对我说
Jeffrey, one day, he said to me,


449
00:21:39.148 --> 00:21:41.776
你需要找个副手了
"You really need to get your own Jeffrey Katzenberg."


450
00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:44.408
我想了想说, 没错
And I began thinking and thinking, "You know, it's right.


451
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:48.114
我不能总是亲历亲为, 毕竟能力也有限
I can't do this by myself and I'm not that talented anyway."


452
00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:50.725
所以我打电话给鲍勃•弗里兹帕特里克
So the call I made was to Bob Fitzpatrick,


453
00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:53.225
他当时正在参加奥林匹克艺术节
who was in the Olympic Arts Festival at the time.


454
00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:55.990
他说, 我有人选了, 我让他去找你
He says,"I think I have somebody. I'll send him over to you.


455
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.359
这个人叫彼得•施耐德
His name is Peter Schneider."


456
00:21:57.566 --> 00:22:00.399
当时我和妻子女儿住在小小的公寓里
I was living in a small apartment with my wife and baby daughter,


457
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.868
她老催我说, 去找份工作吧
and she said to me, "Go get a job," You know.


458
00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:06.065
我当时很天真, 没有思想包袱, 没有定势思维
I was naive. I had no baggage, no preconceived notions.


459
00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:08.005
也不在乎过去发生了些什么
I didn't care what had been done in the past.


460
00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:12.011
但我知道, 我的水平肯定强过黑神锅传奇
I knew that I could do no worse than The Black Cauldron.


461
00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:14.012
反正我也是光脚不怕穿鞋, 无所顾忌
You know, you can't fall off the first floor.


462
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:16.117
彼得担任的职位是动画部副总
Peter was given the title of vice president,


463
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:21.052
看不惯他的动画师们, 将他比作电影里的不合群者
which, to the insurgent population of animators, made him the Man.


464
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.456
而对抗这个不合群者的办法, 就是讽刺漫画
And the main weapon to fight the Man was the dreaded caricature.


465
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:27.755
彼得是个很可怕的家伙, 真的
Well, Peter was kind of a scary thing, you know.


466
00:22:27.896 --> 00:22:29.493
精瘦的身材, 高高的个子
A small frame, wiry, and, you know,


467
00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:31.457
神经兮兮的, 给人感觉, 怪怪的
full of nervous energy. He was like,"Nyah."


468
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.659
他看上去像个15岁的孩子
He looked like he was about 15 years old.


469
00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:37.238
脸上总挂着很招嘲讽的笑容
He had this perpetual smile that everybody caricatured.


470
00:22:37.372 --> 00:22:41.706
他睁圆的眼睛和诡异的笑容, 让人背脊发凉
It was like this kind of wide-eyed, predatory smile that really worried people.


471
00:22:41.844 --> 00:22:43.209
每当你走进他办公室
You'd go into his office,


472
00:22:43.345 --> 00:22:45.973
他扭曲的坐姿俨然像一团椒盐卷饼, 特诡异
he would just sit all twisted up like a pretzel. It was odd.


473
00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:49.311
你进门后, 他会按下一个小开关, 把门关上
And he had a little button that closed the door behind you when you went in.


474
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:51.214
门关上后, 你会不由自主地回头看
When the door closed, you'd kind of look back


475
00:22:51.353 --> 00:22:54.982
好像能从门上发现什么挠痕似的
and see if there were scratch marks on it or something like that.


476
00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:57.148
来到动画部后, 我知道我有100天时间
When I got to Animation, I knew I had a hundred days


477
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.658
来改变这里的文化, 否则我就会被同化
to change the culture before it changed me.


478
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.262
我试着给大家更多自主性
I was trying to empower people,


479
00:23:01.396 --> 00:23:04.763
让他们更加自信, 更重视自己的工作
to make them feel good about themselves, to value the work.


480
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.494
我招进了一些做戏剧时的旧部
I brought in some of my own people who'd worked for me in theater.


481
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:10.161
凯斯琳•嘉文, 毛琳•邓丽, 汤姆•舒马赫
Kathleen Gavin, Maureen Donley, Tom Schumacher.


482
00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.933
甜面包, 我要吃
Sticky buns. Sticky buns.


483
00:23:13.075 --> 00:23:14.872
我邀请了湖人队教练帕特•莱利
I brought in Lakers coach Pat Riley


484
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.944
请他做关于胜利和团队合作的演讲
to talk about winning and teamwork.


485
00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:19.411
彼得要求将每道工序明确细化
Peter picked apart every piece of the production process.


486
00:23:19.548 --> 00:23:22.711
为什么我们上班要打卡?为什么自己做颜料
Why are we punching time clocks? Why are we making our own paint?


487
00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:24.526
为什么不买新的定位尺
Why can't we update our animation pegs?


488
00:23:24.527 --> 00:23:25.945
为什么不多买几部电脑?
Why don't we have more computers?


489
00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:27.248
培训做得怎么样
What about training?


490
00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:30.790
这给人感觉就像光速奔驰的火车
It had this feeling of a freight train leaving the station at light speed.


491
00:23:30.926 --> 00:23:32.757
你要么快点上车, 要么赶紧跳下
You better jump on or jump off fast.


492
00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:36.456
多数人选择了上车, 开始一段疯狂刺激的旅程
Most people got on and it was a wild ride, an exciting time.


493
00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:38.293
这是一种团队体育的精神
There was this team-sport mentality.


494
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.433
只有大家都火力全开, 你才有发挥余地
You can't play the game unless everybody is firing off on all cylinders.


495
00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:43.864
即便是替补队员
Even second string,


496
00:23:43.865 --> 00:23:45.734
也个个摩拳擦掌, 跃跃欲试
you were hungry to be part of this, to jump into the game.


497
00:23:45.874 --> 00:23:49.689
在那种开放包容的气氛下, 大家对一切都精益求精
There was an openness, a permission, almost, to be critical about anything.


498
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.902
当然市场部的人除外
Anything but the Marketing Department.


499
00:23:53.749 --> 00:23:55.979
市场部认为, 贝克街的巴兹尔这个片名
Marketing thought that the title Basil of Baker Street


500
00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:58.746
实在让人摸不着头脑, 应该改一下
was a real head-scratcher and they wanted to change it.


501
00:23:58.887 --> 00:24:00.218
因此彼得发出一份备忘录
So Peter sent off a memo


502
00:24:00.219 --> 00:24:02.880
宣布将片名改为
announcing that they were changing the title to:


503
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.492
老鼠神探（或妙妙探）
The Great Mouse Detective.


504
00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:07.322
此举招来反对声一片, 而且我们开始
The resistance was pretty fierce and we all started trying things


505
00:24:07.462 --> 00:24:09.794
按照自己的方法行事, 但都无济于事
to get it to be our way and it wasn't gonna change.


506
00:24:09.932 --> 00:24:11.806
一名画师想到个好主意,
One of the artists got the bright idea


507
00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:13.993
他以彼得的名义伪造了份备忘录
to send out a fake memo, in Peter's name,


508
00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:17.469
宣称现在所有的迪斯尼影片都要改名
saying that now all the Disney films will be renamed.


509
00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:19.115
从今以后, 白雪公主
From now on, Snow White


510
00:24:19.116 --> 00:24:21.872
将改为七个矮人慷慨助姑娘
would become Seven Little Men Help a Girl.


511
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.140
而匹诺曹将改名为木头男孩下凡间
And Pinocchio would be The Wooden Boy Who Became Real.


512
00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:28.977
彼得明白这场玩笑是在挑战他的权威
Peter saw the joke memo as undermining his authority


513
00:24:29.117 --> 00:24:31.483
他要求彻查恶作剧始作俑者
and demanded to know who wrote the memo.


514
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.748
画师们觉得这点子很有趣, 都不愿供出作者
The artists saw it as good clean fun and kept the author a secret.


515
00:24:35.257 --> 00:24:38.283
相反, 他们把这事捅到杰弗里那儿, 想再作弄一番
They even sent it up to Jeffrey's office for added amusement.


516
00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:39.917
有人放了彼得汽车轮胎的气
Peter, I think his tires were slashed


517
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:42.360
或是有人砸了他的汽车玻璃
or somebody busted his window in his car in the lot.


518
00:24:42.497 --> 00:24:45.989
有些人则表现得很理性
Some, you know, really mature way to handle the situation.


519
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:49.628
彼得把大家召集到放映室
Peter came in and put us all in the screening room


520
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:51.534
把我们结实地教训了一顿
and just tore us a new one.


521
00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:54.767
他暴起青筋的样子活像个漫画人物
That was the fabled triple-veiner that Peter had,


522
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.522
我是说, 他简直
where, I mean, he was, like,


523
00:24:56.523 --> 00:24:58.710
暴跳如雷, 怒火四射, 真的非常生气
levitating and glowing, he was so mad.


524
00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:01.111
那次会议后, 我们都有点尊敬他了
I think after that meeting, we all kind of respected him.


525
00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:02.648
很难得的是, 他没有说
What I love is he didn't say,


526
00:25:02.784 --> 00:25:05.116
给我闭嘴, 看我不惯, 就给我滚
"Shut up. If you don't like it, there's the gate."


527
00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:07.244
他说的是, 我们要做伟大的电影
He said, "We're gonna make great films."


528
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:09.157
杰弗里一笑置之, 说道
And Jeffrey just laughed it off and said,


529
00:25:09.158 --> 00:25:10.825
那当然了
"Don't even worry about it."


530
00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:14.326
我与杰弗里的关系因此拉近了, 虽然有些奇怪
And I think that cemented my relationship with Jeffrey, in some weird way,


531
00:25:14.463 --> 00:25:16.658
而且, 与动画师们的关系也好转了
and also cemented my relationship with the artists.


532
00:25:16.798 --> 00:25:20.461
意想不到的是, 这次事件被某电视节目开发为一类题型
And as a bonus, the memo even ended up as a category on Jeopardy!


533
00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.035
最后, 是同义词题
And finally, In Other Words.


534
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.570
这道同义词题, 来自一次小题大做的恶作剧
In Other Words came about as the result of a big foofaraw


535
00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:26.537
去年发生于迪斯尼工作室
that occurred at the Disney Studios last year


536
00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:28.768
当时员工们发动了一次小规模抗议
when the employees staged a minor revolt


537
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.344
因为公司将贝克街的巴兹尔
when they changed the title of Basil of Baker Street


538
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.879
改名为老鼠神探
to The Great Mouse Detective.


539
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:34.448
我选300分的同义词题
In Other Words for 300.


540
00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:37.177
谜底是“穿透明鞋子的女孩”
"The girl with the see-through shoes."


541
00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:38.718
- 玛娇丽 - 谁是灰姑娘?
Marjorie. Who is Cinderella?


542
00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:40.048
谁是灰姑娘?恭喜答对了
Who is Cinderella? That’s good.


543
00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:44.787
老鼠神探于1986年上映, 好评如潮
The Great Mouse Detective was released in 1986 to good reviews


544
00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:46.359
票房也取得丰收
and respectable box office.


545
00:25:46.495 --> 00:25:48.725
但动画界出现了一个新对手
But there was a new animation threat in town.


546
00:25:48.864 --> 00:25:50.092
史蒂文•斯皮尔伯格
Steven Spielberg.


547
00:25:50.232 --> 00:25:51.867
史蒂文钟爱迪斯尼动画
Steven loved the films of Walt Disney,


548
00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:53.030
所以他也跳进了这一行
so he jumped into the game,


549
00:25:53.168 --> 00:25:55.466
而他的合作者恰恰是唐•布鲁斯
teaming up with none other than Don Bluth,


550
00:25:55.604 --> 00:25:57.504
就是那个在公司低谷期选择背叛的家伙
the animator who kicked us when we were down.


551
00:25:58.006 --> 00:26:00.668
那年, 他制作的美国鼠谭
That year, An American Tail quickly became


552
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.176
迅速成为史上第一部非迪斯尼出品动画票房冠军
the highest-grossing non-Disney animated feature ever,


553
00:26:04.312 --> 00:26:08.772
甩开老鼠神探2200万的票房
beating out The Great Mouse Detective by over $22 million.


554
00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:10.851
奥丽华～
Oliver--


555
00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:13.050
有点意思
That's funny.


556
00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:15.952
我刚来的时候, 奥丽华历险记正在制作中
When I first got there, Oliver and Company was being made.


557
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:17.149
该片有两名导演
It had two directors.


558
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:18.520
这是里克•里奇
This is Rick Rich.


559
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.989
这是乔治•斯克里布纳
This is George Scribner.


560
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.060
我炒了里克•里奇
I fired Rick Rich,


561
00:26:21.196 --> 00:26:22.356
他老跟我对着干
who was belligerent to me,


562
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.658
留下了乔治•斯克里布纳, 他对我言听计从
and kept George Scribner, who sucked up to me.


563
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.597
在当时看来, 这么做完全正确
It seemed like the right decision at the time.


564
00:26:26.735 --> 00:26:29.465
毕竟, 顺我者昌
People who like you get ahead.


565
00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:32.539
彼得将他的戏剧背景引入到动画制作
Peter brought his theatrical background to the animation business.


566
00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:35.700
他要求动画师们根据自己的才能选择团队
He demanded that filmmakers pick their own teams based on talent


567
00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.716
以及自己的搭档
and who they wanted to work with,


568
00:26:37.717 --> 00:26:40.213
而没有搞什么制度化的论资排辈
not on some form of institutional seniority.


569
00:26:40.348 --> 00:26:43.909
如果你没什么鲜明特点, 就意味着淘汰出局
If you didn't have a strong point of view, you disappeared.


570
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:47.019
在创意辩论会上, 你必须设法推销你的点子
There was creative debate. You had to defend your ideas.


571
00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:48.283
这意味着更多的图纸
It meant that more drawings


572
00:26:48.284 --> 00:26:50.249
会进入垃圾桶, 而非大荧幕
went into the trash than went up on the screen.


573
00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:54.089
报废的图纸, 我们抛弃的画作
Throwaway drawings. The drawings we just throw away


574
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:56.129
没有任何意义
that don't mean anything.


575
00:26:56.465 --> 00:27:00.458
这些都是未被采纳的作品
These are the ones that we didn't even use.


576
00:27:00.602 --> 00:27:04.752
无尽的修改, 编剧每改一句台词
Revisions. Every line a writer changed,


577
00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:07.838
就有100幅原画要进垃圾桶

578
00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:14.012
由于公司仍然打着迪斯尼的名号
And because the family name is still the franchise,


579
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:17.641
所以一直在制作迪斯尼式的长篇动画
the company still produces a few of those Disney animated features,


580
00:27:17.786 --> 00:27:20.346
即使这些动画片耗资巨大
even though they cost a fortune to create.


581
00:27:20.489 --> 00:27:22.980
新片是动画版的雾都孤儿
The new one is an animated version of Oliver Twist,


582
00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:24.645
由比利•乔和贝蒂配音
with Billy Joel and Bette


583
00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:27.687
米德勒负责歌唱和犬吠的部分
Midler doing the singing and barking and growling.


584
00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:31.162
全片接近50万帧
But the finished film may well require a half-million frames,


585
00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.268
都是画师们一笔一笔创作而来
each one drawn by an artist


586
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:36.259
总投资超过1000万美元
at a total cost of more than $10 million,


587
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.339
段时间很难收回成本
more than it can make back anytime soon.


588
00:27:40.275 --> 00:27:42.675
您是否真的可以承受
Can you really afford


589
00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:46.611
做您自己想做的动画?
to do what you wanna do in animation as much as you wanna do?


590
00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:49.114
当然承受不了, 但我们义无反顾
The answer is no, but we're doing it anyway.


591
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:51.685
- 我们必须这么做 - 必须?
We have to do it in this company. Have to?


592
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.788
没错, 这是我们的光荣传统
We have to. That is our legacy.


593
00:27:54.022 --> 00:27:56.616
在动画领域, 我是说长篇动画
The animation area, the full-length animation,


594
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:59.488
您承诺过每年出产一部片子, 是这样吗?
you have made a promise to do one film a year. Is that it?


595
00:27:59.628 --> 00:28:04.122
- 这是罗伊承诺的, 我… - 我们一起承诺的
- Well, Roy made it, so I'm-- - We jointly made that one.


596
00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:09.735
没错, 我们确实打算每年出一部
Yeah, it's our intent to make a new one every year.


597
00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:14.336
奥丽华历险记将是计划的第一部
Oliver will be the first in that group.


598
00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:19.510
按照计划, 明年还会推出小美人鱼
And Little Mermaid, the following year, is on schedule to be released a year from now.


599
00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:21.880
我们自信能够做到
And we think we can do it.


600
00:28:22.017 --> 00:28:25.111
我们聚集了越来越多的优秀艺术家
We're accumulating more and more and better artists


601
00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:28.518
也积累了越来越多的经验
and certainly more and more experience as we go.


602
00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:32.218
如虎添翼的是, 一种叫VCR的机器面世了
Helping to feed the coffers in a big way was a machine called the VCR


603
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.792
从此用户可以在自家客厅播放磁带中电影
that could actually play movies from a cassette tape in your own living room.


604
00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:39.924
匹诺曹的录像带
The releasing of Pinocchio in video,


605
00:28:40.235 --> 00:28:41.759
迪斯尼真是令人意外
Disney was never gonna do that.


606
00:28:41.903 --> 00:28:46.247
我还以为他们会顽固不化
I thought that was carved in granite that


607
00:28:46.248 --> 00:28:49.867
过上几年才发布录像带
they would be held in storage for seven years and then released carefully.


608
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.104
到底什么促使他们发布录像带呢?
How was the decision made to put them out in video?


609
00:28:52.247 --> 00:28:56.013
我不认为做这个决定有什么困难的
I don't think there's been any more careful decision than we have reached.


610
00:28:56.151 --> 00:29:00.315
目前我们只推出了一部经典: 匹诺曹
And we have reached it so far only in respect to the one classic, Pinocchio.


611
00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:02.787
今年夏天上市了, 市场反响很好
It's out now this summer. It's doing very well.


612
00:29:02.924 --> 00:29:06.485
这以后我们会慢慢决定是否推出其它经典作品
It's only after that that we'll slowly decide what to do with the rest of it.


613
00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:09.888
毕竟录像带版的匹诺曹
And after all, a video release this summer hardly is gonna affect Pinocchio


614
00:29:09.889 --> 00:29:14.631
对七年前制作的戏剧版几乎没有影响
when it's released theatrically another seven years from now.


615
00:29:15.537 --> 00:29:18.199
匹诺曹作为试金石, 取得了巨大成功
Pinocchio went out as a trial balloon and made millions.


616
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.894
它就像印钞机一样,
It was like a license to print money,


617
00:29:19.895 --> 00:29:22.071
因为重制经典作品几乎没有成本
since there were no costs for the old titles.


618
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.839
很快其它经典作品也被制作成录像带发售
But that immediately upped the ante to get more titles into the pipeline.


619
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:27.447
为了发掘新题材
So to find these new titles,


620
00:29:27.448 --> 00:29:29.542
任何人, 无论是艺术家, 文秘还是清洁工
anybody, artists, secretaries, janitors,


621
00:29:29.684 --> 00:29:32.380
都可以在铜锣秀上提出他们的见解
could come in and pitch their ideas in a gong show.


622
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.646
有些创意, 如风中奇缘
Some ideas, like Pocahontas,


623
00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:36.484
就是由一张原画和一个片名逐步完成的
were green-lit from a single drawing and a title.


624
00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:38.855
其它的, 如小美人鱼, 刚开始被否决了
Others, like Little Mermaid, were gonged at first,


625
00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:41.827
因为与前作美人鱼太相似, 但后来又获通过
because it was too much like Splash, but came back later.


626
00:29:41.963 --> 00:29:44.124
当时很多项目都获准开工
And there were all sorts of projects being green-lit.


627
00:29:44.566 --> 00:29:47.433
其中一部续集作品叫救难小英雄, 以澳大利亚为故事背景
A sequel idea called Rescuers Down Under, set in Australia.


628
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.867
还有王子与乞儿, 米老鼠也在片中出现
Prince And The Pauper, starring Mickey Mouse.


629
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:54.854
还有一些沃特•迪斯尼曾经构思的项目
And an old shelved project that Walt Disney himself considered back in the 1940s,


630
00:29:54.855 --> 00:29:56.740
比如美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast.


631
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.890
除了已故的迪斯尼先生
Not only does the ghost of Walt Disney,


632
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:01.071
当时的制作组也出现创意井喷
the creative genius, keep Eisner awake at night.


633
00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:02.945
埃斯纳初到公司时
When he first came to the company,


634
00:30:03.084 --> 00:30:06.349
他发现高管们决策前, 会习惯性地问一句
he discovered that executives routinely made decisions by asking,


635
00:30:06.488 --> 00:30:07.853
若是沃特, 他会怎么做?
"What would Walt have done?"


636
00:30:07.989 --> 00:30:10.423
通常, 有些人会斩钉截铁地说
To a certain extent, people, somebody, would surely have said,


637
00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:12.253
沃特应该不会这么做
"Walt probably wouldn't have done that."


638
00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:13.793
我们要打破这样的循环
We needed to break that cycle


639
00:30:13.928 --> 00:30:17.125
我们要将思维打开
and we needed to get out into the whole town.


640
00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:22.732
有人说, 我们活在死人的阴影下
The argument that says,"Some dead guy is trying to run your operation."


641
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:24.338
我们不能这样
You can't do that.


642
00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:27.066
迪斯尼先生不是金科玉律
I don't think Disney is like the constitution.


643
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.472
我们没有必要墨守成规
I don't think we have to preserve it and put it in glass.


644
00:30:29.611 --> 00:30:32.774
公司还在成长 不思进取意味着坐以待毙
I think it's a growing-- And if it's not growing, it's gonna die.


645
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.142
迪斯尼是一个伟大名字
Our name is a fantastic asset


646
00:30:34.282 --> 00:30:37.308
它来自于一个充满创新精神的伟人
and it represents a terrific man who was very creative.


647
00:30:37.452 --> 00:30:41.479
我不想成为那个自砸招牌的人
And I'd hate to be the person who shot himself in the foot and ended it.


648
00:30:41.623 --> 00:30:44.353
我不愿坐吃空山, 我要继往开来
I don't wanna leave that legacy. I'd like to keep it going.


649
00:30:44.492 --> 00:30:47.859
我希望有所建树, 带来新的东西
But I'd like to add to it. I'd like to have new things.


650
00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:49.429
你最害怕什么?
What do you worry about?


651
00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:50.997
搬石头砸自己的脚
Shooting myself in the foot.


652
00:30:58.473 --> 00:31:02.242
1983年来, 迪斯尼净利润翻了三倍
Disney's net profits tripled since 1983


653
00:31:02.243 --> 00:31:03.433
股价涨了五倍
and the stock price is up five-fold.


654
00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:06.843
迪斯尼人很自豪地自称为米老鼠公司
Disney people are proud to call themselves a Mickey Mouse operation.


655
00:31:06.981 --> 00:31:09.226
多数分析师认为, 迪斯尼能再创辉煌
According to most analysts, the magic returned with


656
00:31:09.227 --> 00:31:11.709
得益于弗兰克•威尔斯和迈克尔•埃斯纳的带领
the appointment of Frank Wells as president of the company and Michael Eisner as chairman.


657
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.859
在埃斯纳和威尔斯的掌管下
Under Eisner and Wells,


658
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.920
电影部试金石影业蓬勃发展
the new Touchstone Movie Division became a production powerhouse,


659
00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:20.892
制作了如贝弗丽山奇遇记
turning out such hits as Down and Out in Beverly Hills,


660
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:22.894
残酷之人, 金钱本色等佳片
Ruthless People, The Color of Money,


661
00:31:23.031 --> 00:31:25.761
以及新兴电影人才成长的摇篮
and what amounts to a farm club for feature filmmakers,


662
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.424
迪斯尼周日电影秀
The Disney Sunday Movie.


663
00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:32.904
1987年迪斯尼与迈克尔•杰克逊合作的伊奥船长上演

664
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:36.670
与乔治•卢卡斯合作的星际之旅也正式开启
and the Disney George Lucas collaborative adventure, Star Tours.


665
00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:39.746
真人电影, 主题公园以及商品行业都如火如荼
The live-action movies, the parks, the merchandise were all on fire,


666
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:41.178
而动画片
but Animation,


667
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:44.080
仍然像是被冷落的孩子
well, we still seemed like a stepchild.


668
00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:48.519
不得不说, 我对前路感到担忧
And I gotta say, I was very nervous about where we were heading,


669
00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.647
不知道迪斯尼的未来在哪里
where was the future of Disney going.


670
00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:55.627
它像一辆疯狂行驶的汽车
It seemed to be being driven by a maniac at the wheel,


671
00:31:56.331 --> 00:32:01.428
因为有杰弗里这样猛踩油门的掌舵人
in terms of Jeffrey, with his heavy foot on the accelerator,


672
00:32:01.569 --> 00:32:04.595
在拥挤的城市飞速奔驰
driving full speed in a very crowded city.


673
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:08.903
开始
Action.


674
00:32:09.043 --> 00:32:11.603
当时有个老项目叫谁陷害了兔子罗杰
An old development project called Who Framed Roger Rabbit


675
00:32:11.746 --> 00:32:15.182
因为斯皮尔伯格的青睐而进展神速
shifted into hyper-drive when Steven Spielberg became interested.


676
00:32:15.316 --> 00:32:19.780
要知道, 沃特•迪斯尼的电影对我影响极大
You know, I have been influenced profoundly by the films of Walt Disney,


677
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:24.085
特别是30, 40直到50年代的片子
especially the films from the '30s, '40s and right through the '50s.


678
00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:29.595
我真心觉得这部电影就是在向沃特致敬
And I really feel that this is a movie that we're making for Walt.


679
00:32:30.064 --> 00:32:32.191
电影回到未来的导演罗伯特•泽米基斯
Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis


680
00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:34.198
受命执导兔子罗杰
was signed to direct Roger Rabbit.


681
00:32:34.335 --> 00:32:36.860
泽米基斯和斯皮尔伯格包办了影片的创意部分
Bob and Steven made up the creative team on the film,


682
00:32:37.005 --> 00:32:39.064
而杰弗里负责掐紧预算
while Jeffrey watched the purse strings.


683
00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:42.546
我们希望联合迪斯尼的技术
We always wanted the Disney technique,


684
00:32:42.547 --> 00:32:45.271
迪斯尼的美工
the beautiful Disney animation,


685
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.780
华纳兄弟的人物塑造
the great Warner Bros. Characterization.


686
00:32:51.252 --> 00:32:53.743
以及泰克斯•艾弗利的幽默
And Tex Avery humor.


687
00:32:54.088 --> 00:32:56.522
这样的组合简直屌炸天
You know, dynamite-down-your-pants type stuff.


688
00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:59.456
兔子好像… 不想回去而霍斯金斯…
And the rabbit's like-- Doesn't wanna go back in and Hoskins...


689
00:32:59.594 --> 00:33:01.255
要凑成上述的梦幻组合
It was a trifecta of elements


690
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:04.365
泽米基斯知道不能指望迪斯尼动画部
that Bob knew he couldn't get from the Disney Animation Department,


691
00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:06.467
因此他通过动画界元老理查德•威廉姆斯
so he turned to animation veteran Richard Williams


692
00:33:06.601 --> 00:33:08.125
将拍摄点定在伦敦
to animate the movie in London,


693
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:11.705
接着彼得派我监督动画的制作
and Peter sent me to London to ride herd on the animation.


694
00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:14.839
这对伯班克的那帮人打击很大
It was a real stomach punch for the guys back in Burbank,


695
00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:19.106
而实际上, 当时没什么人关注迪斯尼动画部
but the truth was nobody really thought much of Disney Animation back then.


696
00:33:19.347 --> 00:33:23.275
斯皮尔伯格, 泽米基斯和威廉姆斯的组合充满了魔力
The combination of Spielberg, Zemeckis and Dick Williams was like a talent magnet


697
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:27.354
全世界动画人蜂拥而至, 欲加盟该项目
and animators from all over the world just flocked to the project.


698
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.580
因此伦敦形成了伯班克之外一个分部
So now there was a unit in Burbank and one in London.


699
00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:34.092
彼得往返两地, 频繁地施展激将法
And Peter would travel back and forth to rattle everybody's cage.


700
00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:35.287
在伦敦工作室
When he was in London,


701
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.422
他就说伯班克的小美人鱼项目做得多出色
he'd say how great the guys in Burbank were doing on The Little Mermaid.


702
00:33:38.566 --> 00:33:39.624
在伯班克
Then back in Burbank,


703
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:42.292
他就大肆赞扬兔子罗杰有多棒
he'd brag about how great the guys on Roger Rabbit were doing.


704
00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:44.371
没人试过这样做电影
Nobody had attempted a movie like this before,


705
00:33:44.506 --> 00:33:45.734
预算也直线攀升
and the budget just soared.


706
00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:48.809
因此杰弗里心急火燎地把我们招到纽约
It got so heated that Jeffrey summoned us all to New York


707
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:52.242
告诉我们实在一个子儿也拿不出了
to tell us that we did not have one more dime to spend on this movie.


708
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.007
真没钱了
No more money.


709
00:33:54.148 --> 00:33:57.982
然后我们乘着豪车或直升机赶往机场, 直飞伦敦
Then we all took limos, helicopters to the airport to fly Concorde back to London.


710
00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:00.644
我们铺张地办这次会议, 来告诉大家我们没钱了
He spent all this money on a meeting to tell us we had no money.


711
00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:02.688
一钱难死英雄汉, 典型的好莱坞游戏
It was a very Hollywood moment.


712
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:06.754
公司本部, 杰弗里因迈克尔给的资金压力而郁闷
Back home, Jeffrey was getting beat up by Michael about the costs.


713
00:34:06.895 --> 00:34:09.921
创意人员完全被预算捆缚了手脚
We just had to put a financial box around all this creativity.


714
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:13.323
但如果不控制预算, 局面就会难以收拾
And without that, the end result would have been complete chaos.


715
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:19.600
这让我和迈克尔之间产生了很多摩擦和问题
It created a tremendous amount of friction and difficulty between Michael and I,


716
00:34:19.741 --> 00:34:22.073
不是他不相信这部电影, 他很有信心
not because he didn't believe in the movie. He did.


717
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.236
只是因为它实在太昂贵了
Financially it just became so expensive.


718
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.679
加上迈克尔又是个很保守的人
And Michael, who is fundamentally conservative,


719
00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:31.341
他对如此冒险的行为感到很不快
just got very, very uncomfortable with it.


720
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:34.250
停, 再来一遍
Cut. Let's do it again.


721
00:34:37.091 --> 00:34:40.254
而我也无法掌控局面
And I was unable to control it.


722
00:34:43.264 --> 00:34:44.619
谁陷害了兔子罗杰
Who Framed Roger Rabbit


723
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.160
是一部好莱坞不可多得的惊喜制作
is one of those home runs that Hollywood hits every once in a while.


724
00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:52.103
可以比肩2001太空漫游和第三类接触, 很像ET外星人
It's a movie like 2001 or Close Encounters or especially like E. T.


725
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.746
它有很多技术创新
that's a technical breakthrough


726
00:34:53.747 --> 00:34:55.641
同时又充满了趣味
and a lot of fun both at the same time.


727
00:34:55.777 --> 00:34:56.971
兔子罗杰引发热议
Roger Rabbit made headlines


728
00:34:57.111 --> 00:35:01.377
夺得奥斯卡奖 还让公司赚得盆满钵满
and won Oscars for technical innovation and returned just millions to the studio.


729
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.950
兔子罗杰的核心主创人员回到伯班克
The top talent on Roger was shipped back to Burbank


730
00:35:04.085 --> 00:35:06.986
开始投入到奥丽华历险记和小美人鱼的制作
and put to work on Oliver and Company and Little Mermaid.


731
00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:09.817
年轻国际化人才的创意爆发
It was like an injection of fresh, young, international talent


732
00:35:09.958 --> 00:35:12.893
简直是可遇不可求
that would pay dividends for years to come.


733
00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:14.722
六个月后, 奥丽华历险记
Six months later, Oliver and Company opened


734
00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:18.127
与斯皮尔伯格的史前大陆同期上映
on the same day as Spielberg's Land Before Time.


735
00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.426
来吧, 我们吃了他！
Come on. Let's eat him!


736
00:35:19.567 --> 00:35:22.092
差不多三四个月后
Well, by the end of the three or four months,


737
00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:24.670
我们赚了5500万的样子
we'd made 55, 56, 54.


738
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.841
而且我们打败了史前大陆, 感觉…
And we beat Land Before Time and it was like--


739
00:35:27.976 --> 00:35:31.412
很多人觉得说, 嘿, 有料有料
I think a lot of people were like, "Hey, there's something--


740
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.104
这电影有看头
There's something here."


741
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:36.976
迈克尔与公司整体的磨合期逐渐渡过
The chaos that Roy ushered in when he hired Michael was starting to pay off


742
00:35:37.118 --> 00:35:41.418
突然间, 大家都变得非常团结协作
and suddenly everybody was happy to be associated with Toontown.


743
00:35:47.595 --> 00:35:50.621
这是第一部童话…
This is the first fairy tale that…


744
00:35:50.765 --> 00:35:55.532
在来一遍, 过去三十年间, 这么多经典
Take two. In the last 30 years, three decades.


745
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.230
为什么选择了美人鱼?
Why was Mermaid chosen?


746
00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.138
这个嘛, 有一天我们一起去吃午饭
Well, I mean, it was chosen because we all went to a lunch


747
00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:06.405
差不多是三四年前, 我们大家一起
about three or four years ago and all of us--


748
00:36:06.547 --> 00:36:08.412
其实这有点试验的意思
It was sort of a development-type thing.


749
00:36:08.549 --> 00:36:10.915
我们每个人想出三个点子
And we were supposed to come in with our three ideas.


750
00:36:11.052 --> 00:36:12.684
不知道是否会被采用
I don't know if you can use any of this,


751
00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:14.317
但这种做法
but this is sort of more the truth than,


752
00:36:14.455 --> 00:36:16.514
比自己藏着掖着好多了
you know, what we may wind up saying later.


753
00:36:16.658 --> 00:36:20.560
这样做可以看到不同的想法
And basically they wanted to draw on different ideas.


754
00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:23.994
而罗恩提出的一点就是小美人鱼
And one of the ideas that Ron brought in was The Little Mermaid.


755
00:36:24.132 --> 00:36:25.793
这是他的三个点子之一
He had-- That was one of his three.


756
00:36:26.034 --> 00:36:27.262
杰弗里的朋友大卫•格芬
Jeffrey's friend David Geffen


757
00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:29.381
向他推荐了一支作曲团队
called him about a songwriting team,


758
00:36:29.382 --> 00:36:31.031
霍华德•阿斯曼和艾伦•门肯
Howard Ashman and Alan Menken,


759
00:36:31.172 --> 00:36:33.394
格芬曾与他们合作过一部非百老汇舞台剧
that he'd worked with on the off-Broadway hit


760
00:36:33.395 --> 00:36:34.505
恐怖小屋
Little Shop of Horrors.


761
00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:37.668
彼得以前也与他们合作过同一部剧
Peter had worked with them on the same show as company manager,


762
00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:40.610
因此委任他们为小美人鱼作曲
so he brought them in to work on The Little Mermaid.


763
00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:43.239
霍华德当时可谓心灰意懒
Howard was just coming off a terrible disappointment


764
00:36:43.384 --> 00:36:46.251
因为他的音乐剧《微笑》在百老汇遭遇滑铁卢
when his musical Smile crashed and burned on Broadway.


765
00:36:46.387 --> 00:36:48.514
他准备在洛杉矶东山再起
He came to Los Angeles to start over again.


766
00:36:48.656 --> 00:36:52.023
霍华德不是迪斯尼最引人注意的那一个
Howard wasn't exactly the first guy who sprang to mind when you said Disney.


767
00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.355
他出生在巴尔的摩的一个犹太家庭
He was born into a Jewish family in Baltimore,


768
00:36:54.495 --> 00:36:57.658
从小就在当地的儿童剧院舞台表演
where he grew up on-stage in the local Children's Theater Association.


769
00:36:57.799 --> 00:37:01.701
他是同性恋, 前卫, 热爱音乐剧, 特别迷彼得•潘
He was gay, edgy, and loved musicals, especially Peter Pan.


770
00:37:01.836 --> 00:37:09.536
当我得到与迪斯尼合作的机会, 我简直跳…
When I was approached with an opportunity to work for Disney, period, I leapt at the--


771
00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:10.967
我告诉自己, 动画也不错
I said,"What about Animation?


772
00:37:10.968 --> 00:37:12.703
就在动画部工作吧
What about working in that department?"


773
00:37:12.847 --> 00:37:14.712
这是我真正想做的
That was what I really wanted to do here,


774
00:37:14.849 --> 00:37:18.046
超过任何其它事物, 任何真人电影
much, much more than anything, really, in live-action.


775
00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:20.017
因为我非常热衷于音乐剧
Because I'm really a musical-theater person


776
00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:24.352
而且我看到了音乐剧与动画片间的紧密关系
and I do see a very, very strong connection between these two media.


777
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:26.790
起初的剧本里有这么一个角色
We had this character in the original treatment, the script.


778
00:37:26.928 --> 00:37:30.762
是一只螃蟹, 他有些…
It was a crab character that was kind of-- Would be--


779
00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:32.729
他一直照顾着美人鱼
Sort of look after the mermaid


780
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.027
并且帮她解决麻烦, 保护她
and try to keep her out of trouble and watch over her.


781
00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:38.496
他执拗, 老气, 古怪, 典型的国王右大臣
He was kind of a crusty, old, crotchety character The king's right-hand guy.


782
00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:41.665
他工作勤恳, 还是海底世界的指挥家
who worked for the king and was like the conductor in the undersea world.


783
00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:43.970
霍华德说, 把他设定为牙买加人吧
Howard said, "Why not make him Jamaican?"


784
00:37:44.112 --> 00:37:46.774
我们的第一反应是, 牙买加?
And our first reaction was,"Jamaican?"


785
00:37:46.914 --> 00:37:49.246
我们都有些理解不过来
I mean, it was like a total twist on what we were thinking.


786
00:37:49.383 --> 00:37:53.547
他召集所有的鱼和事物
He rounds up all of these fish and all of this stuff


787
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:57.124
想说服艾丽儿不要变成人
to convince Ariel not to try to become human.


788
00:37:57.258 --> 00:38:03.959
他们想用乐器和他们自身, 为她奉上一场演出
And they more or less put on a show for her by playing all these instruments and themselves.


789
00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:06.123
然后, 音乐开始了
Okay, we hear it start.


790
00:38:07.902 --> 00:38:09.426
他开始为乐曲定调
He starts establishing the rhythm.


791
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.256
蛤蜊和牡蛎登场
The clams pick it up, and oysters,


792
00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:15.338
而他在龙虾身上敲击
and he's beating on lobsters, whatever.


793
00:38:16.677 --> 00:38:17.735
都是打击乐的声音
It's all percussive


794
00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:21.246
来自整个海底世界的节奏
and it's all the undersea world making the percussion.


795
00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:29.816
空气中充满了能量
There was electricity in the air.


796
00:38:29.957 --> 00:38:32.687
我是说, 人们能看到这是真正的天才之作
I mean, there was real genius at work and people knew it.


797
00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.170
霍华德, 从营销的角度说
Howard, in a salesmanship way, I think,


798
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:50.834
他希望处理得更即兴一些
trying to treat it sort of a little more off-the-cuff,


799
00:38:50.978 --> 00:38:54.311
不过我觉得他所有的创作都是突发的灵感
but I think he had written all the songs five minutes after he got the treatment,


800
00:38:54.448 --> 00:38:56.348
比如说, 现在有首歌
but said, "Now, here, say you had a song,


801
00:38:56.484 --> 00:38:58.042
不如就取名“憧憬你们的世界”吧
say it was called 'Part of Your World.'


802
00:38:58.186 --> 00:39:00.814
其实歌名无所谓, 就叫憧憬你们的世界吧
It could be anything, but say it was called 'Part of Your World'."


803
00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:03.890
之后他… 还有艾伦…
And then he had a-- And Alan--


804
00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:08.155
我们聚在霍华德格林威治村的公寓
We were in Howard's apartment in Greenwich Village and it was--


805
00:39:08.296 --> 00:39:10.491
艾伦站出来弹了这首曲子
Alan came over and played it on the piano.


806
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:14.362
霍华德伴唱, 效果非常好
And Howard sang it right there and it sounded great.


807
00:39:25.847 --> 00:39:29.578
真的要好好拿捏这个度
So really try to work with just the intensity.


808
00:39:29.717 --> 00:39:33.619
就是那种心潮澎湃, 却压抑不发的感觉
It's like it's about all that emotion and then not letting it all out.


809
00:39:33.754 --> 00:39:36.848
- 压抑不发 - 对, 都藏在心里
Not letting it out. Not letting it out, but having it here.


810
00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:42.394
就这样, 真的, 这…
That stuff. Really, it's--


811
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.021
- 我是不是声音大了点? - 你挺好的
Am I still a little too loud? You're great.


812
00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.531
- 好点吗? - 你很棒
Better that time? You're great.


813
00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:48.532
但没错, 这里要欢快一些
But you're right, it gets a little bright here.


814
00:39:52.607 --> 00:39:54.871
紧张的程度要超过…
The intensity is better than--


815
00:39:56.544 --> 00:39:58.705
超过正常说话, 超过埃塞尔•摩曼
Is better than noise. Than Ethel Merman, right.


816
00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:01.508
但你唱的不是埃塞尔•摩曼, 这是一种内心的纠结
But you're not doing Ethel Merman. It's inner intensity, though.


817
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:04.516
几乎所有的音乐剧
In almost every musical ever written,


818
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:07.052
都有这样的场景, 通常是当晚的第三首歌
there's a place, it's usually the third song of the evening.


819
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:10.521
有时是第二首或第四首, 总之出现很早
Sometimes it's the second, sometimes it's the fourth, but it's quite early.


820
00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:13.126
女主角通常会坐在什么东西上面
And the leading lady usually sits down on something,


821
00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:15.456
如蓬莱仙舞中的树墩
sometimes it's a tree stump in Brigadoon,


822
00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:19.965
或是窈窕淑女中, 科芬花园的柱子
sometimes it's under the pillars of Covent Garden in My Fair Lady,


823
00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:22.092
或是异形奇花中的垃圾桶
or it's a trash can in Little Shop of Horrors.


824
00:40:22.236 --> 00:40:24.136
总之女主角会坐在什么上面
But the leading lady sits down on something


825
00:40:24.272 --> 00:40:26.740
然后歌唱自己的梦想
and sings about what she wants in life


826
00:40:26.874 --> 00:40:28.808
然后观众就会爱上她
and the audience falls in love with her


827
00:40:28.943 --> 00:40:31.878
这就为后续的故事奠定了基调
and then roots for her to get it for the rest of the night.


828
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:41.079
听过茱蒂•本森的这首歌后
I heard"Part of Your World," Jodi Benson singing that,


829
00:40:41.222 --> 00:40:45.886
我被深深打动了, 心想, 这活儿我一定要接下
and it just captivated me. I thought, "I have to do that."


830
00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:49.155
我告诉大家, 我来负责画艾丽儿
And I went and told those guys, "I really wanna do Ariel."


831
00:40:49.297 --> 00:40:51.197
他们说: 这个, 不好吧
And they said, "Whoa, I don't know.


832
00:40:51.332 --> 00:40:53.892
这可是个漂亮姑娘, 你确定能画好吗?
This is supposed to be a pretty girl. Can you do that?"


833
00:40:54.035 --> 00:40:57.596
我说: 听着, 我一定要画艾丽儿
I said, "Look, I have to do Ariel.


834
00:40:57.738 --> 00:41:00.571
这是我内心的召唤
I can feel it in my heart."


835
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:04.208
我们为一群小学生办了场试映
We were previewing for school kids.


836
00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:06.973
然后, 孩子们…
And so the kids--


837
00:41:07.114 --> 00:41:11.107
放映过程中, 一部分内容还未上色
During that screening, a lot of the movie was in black and white.


838
00:41:11.285 --> 00:41:13.913
憧憬你的世界这一段也是, 甚至是素描草稿
Certainly "Part of Your World," A lot of it was in story sketches.


839
00:41:14.322 --> 00:41:16.449
影片开始播放
And the movie comes up on its feet


840
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.024
放到憧憬你的世界这一段时
and we get to "Part of Your World"


841
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.060
观众反应很糟糕
and it's just not connecting.


842
00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:22.423
全场躁动不安
The audience is restless.


843
00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:25.088
我站出来说: 这首歌不行
I came out of that and just said, "Don't think this is working."


844
00:41:25.232 --> 00:41:28.929
所以杰弗里也决定剪掉这一段
So Jeffrey was bound and determined to cut "Part of Your World."


845
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.436
他的意思是: 伙计们, 面对现实吧
It was just like, "Guys, face reality, you know.


846
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.972
这首歌不受欢迎, 不顶用, 放弃吧
It's not working, it's not there. We gotta do something."


847
00:41:34.108 --> 00:41:36.167
我们努力辩护, 但杰弗里听不进
And we pleaded our case. He wouldn't listen to us.


848
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.709
霍华德也在极力坚持
Howard pleaded his case.


849
00:41:37.845 --> 00:41:39.260
他决绝地说
Howard Ashman said,


850
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:41.042
除非先杀了我, 我死也不会放过你
"Over my dead body. I'll strangle you."


851
00:41:41.182 --> 00:41:44.208
最后格伦•吉恩跟杰弗里说
But finally Glen Keane went to Jeffrey and said,


852
00:41:44.352 --> 00:41:46.377
杰弗里, 别剪这段
"Jeffrey, you cannot cut this.


853
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.283
别犯傻, 这是这部片子的灵魂
You're crazy. This is the heart of the movie.


854
00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:49.821
这是女主人公的梦想
It's her whole dream.


855
00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:53.484
剪掉这段意味着切断观众与人物间的纽带
And to cut that will really gut our emotional involvement with our heroine."


856
00:41:53.627 --> 00:41:56.619
他说服了我, 告诉我这不仅仅是一首歌
He persuaded me that the issue wasn't the song,


857
00:41:56.764 --> 00:42:00.131
而是串联整个故事的主旋律
but other things that were not firing up yet in the sort of rhythm of the movie.


858
00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.159
最后证明他是对的
And ultimately he was right.


859
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.682
这一段不仅成为全片亮点
Not only did it stay in the movie,


860
00:42:04.683 --> 00:42:06.364
甚至足以留名影史
but it's one of the more memorable moments in the movie.


861
00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:09.533
童话的城堡如今重放光辉
The sparkle is coming back to Sleeping Beauty's castle.


862
00:42:09.677 --> 00:42:12.009
过去五年, 迪斯尼动画部的团队
Over the last five years, the Disney Animation Department


863
00:42:12.146 --> 00:42:16.515
从150人发展到如今550人的规模
has grown from a low of 150 artists to its current level of nearly 550,


864
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.675
他们坚持传统的制作工艺
doing animation the old-fashioned way,


865
00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:20.968
从素描草稿, 到铅笔测试
from character sketch, to pencil test,


866
00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:22.778
到上色, 最后到放映
to ink and paint, to the screen.


867
00:42:22.923 --> 00:42:25.323
希望小美人鱼能开启
What The Little Mermaid represents, I hope,


868
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:30.726
动画艺术的复兴
is kind of a renaissance period for the artists themselves.


869
00:42:30.865 --> 00:42:32.992
杰弗里开始发现动画
Jeffrey started discovering Animation


870
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:35.625
可以展现他的艺术和编辑才华
as a place where he could be artistic, a powerhouse in the editing room,


871
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.795
他也乐意成为影片的发言人
and where he could be the frontman to the press.


872
00:42:37.938 --> 00:42:40.270
杰弗里从中看到了自己的未来
I think he realized something very important to his future.


873
00:42:40.408 --> 00:42:42.601
做得不错, 又有趣
"I'm good at this. This is fun,


874
00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:45.573
而且不用受迈克尔的管教
it's mine and it doesn't include Michael."


875
00:42:45.713 --> 00:42:47.806
小美人鱼的发布会非常成功
The press on Little Mermaid was just spectacular.


876
00:42:47.948 --> 00:42:50.917
票房甚至超过了奥丽华历险记
And the box office, well, was even better than Oliver and Company.


877
00:42:51.152 --> 00:42:54.212
衍生的玩具, 书籍, 拼图和饭盒
And there were loads of toys, books, puzzles and lunch boxes


878
00:42:54.355 --> 00:42:56.016
纷纷推向市场
that just flew off the shelves.


879
00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:58.352
因为动画部的成功
Animation had a big hit on its hands.


880
00:42:59.193 --> 00:43:01.423
公司高层开始关注起来
Jeffrey and Michael started focusing on,


881
00:43:01.562 --> 00:43:04.929
要是多拍几部动画, 公司能多赚一些
"Oh, if we have more titles, it'll be better financially."


882
00:43:05.066 --> 00:43:06.693
而我一直在争取
And I always fought for,


883
00:43:06.834 --> 00:43:09.928
你们能不能投点钱来改进技术?
"Can you take some of those resources and put them back into the business?"


884
00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:11.932
之后我们就买了CAPS
Which was where CAPS came from,


885
00:43:12.073 --> 00:43:14.974
CAPS指的是计算机动画后期处理系统
CAPS being the Computer Animation Postproduction System.


886
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:16.310
有个叫莱姆•戴维斯的技术员认为
One of the technology guys, Lem Davis,


887
00:43:16.311 --> 00:43:19.995
我们可以用电脑给人物上色
thought we could use computers to paint the characters in our films


888
00:43:19.996 --> 00:43:23.114
并用电脑进行合成
and digitally assemble all the artwork.


889
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:28.517
这不仅能提高我们的艺术水准
That gives us not only the opportunity to do some really good art,


890
00:43:28.656 --> 00:43:31.591
还让我们有机会探索
but it also gives us the opportunity to really begin to explore


891
00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:34.956
计算机和图形技术的潜力
what these computers and graphics things can do for us


892
00:43:35.096 --> 00:43:39.931
对细节的研究令我们有些着迷
in kind of shorter pieces where we can get really a little crazy.


893
00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:42.763
我也很希望大家努力去探索计算机技术
And I'm looking forward to all of us getting a little crazy.


894
00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:46.202
罗伊向高层申请了一千万购买一套计算机系统
Roy went to Frank Wells with a proposal to spend $10 million


895
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.831
该系统可能不会带来任何回报
on a computer system that might not return a dime,


896
00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:51.342
也可能意味着行业的革命
but would revolutionize the look of our films.


897
00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:54.739
我穿过走廊, 站在弗兰克办公室门口
So I just walked down the hall and stood there in Frank's doorway.


898
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:56.907
他看着说: 你在这干嘛?
Frank looks up and says, "What are you doing here?"


899
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:59.849
我说: 我要看着你签下那张支票, 弗兰克
And I said,"I'm just here to make sure you sign that check, Frank."


900
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.121
支票交到了匠白光手中
Frank's check was handed to Alvy Ray Smith,


901
00:44:03.257 --> 00:44:05.157
他是一家小型图形技术公司的联合创始人
the co-founder of a small computer-graphics firm


902
00:44:05.292 --> 00:44:07.021
该公司专注于人物动画
that experimented with character animation


903
00:44:07.361 --> 00:44:10.853
曾经为李施德林漱口水制作过广告片
and made Listerine commercials on the side to make ends meet.


904
00:44:11.365 --> 00:44:14.391
这家公司, 就是皮克斯
It was called Pixar.


905
00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:18.794
CAPS系统应用在救难小英雄的制作
The CAPS computer was thrown into production on Rescuers Down Under.


906
00:44:18.939 --> 00:44:20.270
这是一个方兴未艾的领域
It was unchartered territory.


907
00:44:20.407 --> 00:44:21.790
迪斯尼和皮克斯的员工
The crew from Disney and Pixar


908
00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:23.865
昼夜赶工, 废寝忘食
worked around the clock, sleeping on pallets,


909
00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:26.639
用简陋的办法维护设备
nursing those computers with duct tape and chewing gum,


910
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.374
时间和资金一直十分紧张
and the deadlines and quotas never stopped.


911
00:44:29.517 --> 00:44:31.603
不, 我的想法会吓到你
No, you don't want to hear my thoughts.


912
00:44:31.604 --> 00:44:33.476
你还是别听了
You don't want to hear my thoughts.


913
00:44:33.621 --> 00:44:36.715
那是一段令人沮丧的经历
What I remember most of that period was feeling so brokenhearted


914
00:44:36.857 --> 00:44:41.294
我们试图用CAPS系统完成一部长篇动画
that we had attempted to make a feature film using the CAPS system


915
00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:43.225
而其他公司连短片都还做不了
before anyone had even made a short with it.


916
00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:47.263
我们公布电影发售日前, 从未测试过这套系统
We had never tested the system before we committed to a release date to make a movie.


917
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.891
记得那是凌晨三点
And it's 3:00 in the morning.


918
00:44:49.036 --> 00:44:52.164
彼得走过来, 看了我一眼, 又走开了
Peter Schneider walks in and looks over at me and goes,


919
00:44:52.306 --> 00:44:55.241
怎么样?管用吗?
"Well, is it working yet? Is it working yet?"


920
00:44:55.376 --> 00:44:58.243
真是, 真别给我这么多压力
And it's like, "Oh, I don't need this pressure."


921
00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:00.142
我的首部影片, 救难小英雄上映了
My first film, Rescuers Down Under, came out.


922
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:04.149
早上八点, 电话响了 - 麦克吗?- 是 - 我是杰弗里
Phone rings at like 8 in the morning. "Mike?""Yeah.""Jeffrey."


923
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.219
怎么样?票房如何?
"Yeah. So, what's going on? What's the numbers?"


924
00:45:06.353 --> 00:45:08.844
他说: 卖了500万, 我们失败了
He said, "Made 5 million. It's over."


925
00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:10.286
什么, 你说什么?
"Well, excuse me, what?"


926
00:45:10.424 --> 00:45:12.085
玩完了, 别惦记了, 继续加油吧
"It's over. Forget it. Move on."


927
00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:14.194
杰弗里撤掉了所有的电视广告
Jeffrey pulled all the TV advertising.


928
00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:19.197
我跟他说: 杰弗里, 你干嘛撤掉广告?
And I said, "Jeffrey, I just can't believe that. You've pulled it?


929
00:45:19.333 --> 00:45:20.925
不打广告了?搞什么?
There's no advertising, nothing?"


930
00:45:21.068 --> 00:45:24.560
他说: 汤姆, 这部电影失败了, 都玩完了
And he said, "Tom, the movie just doesn't work. It's over."


931
00:45:24.705 --> 00:45:27.503
我对着电话哭了起来
And I started to cry on the telephone.


932
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:30.448
接着他说: 没关系
And then he said, "It's okay.


933
00:45:30.449 --> 00:45:33.512
我们从头来过, 再拍一部
We're gonna move forward and we'll do something else.


934
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:34.807
你没事吧?
Are you okay?"


935
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:35.931
我说: 没事
I said, "I'm all right."


936
00:45:35.932 --> 00:45:38.316
他说: 很好, 我们明天开始拍新片
He goes, "Okay, we'll start again tomorrow."


937
00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:39.680
然后他挂掉了电话
And then he hung up the phone.


938
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.551
救难小英雄堪称好莱坞第一部数字电影
Rescuers was the very first digital movie produced in Hollywood.


939
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:46.319
它为后来者的成功奠定了基础
And without it we would never have achieved what would come later.


940
00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:53.130
下一部电影是美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast was up next


941
00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:56.703
预算和制作期都变得苛刻许多
and the budget and schedule were cut way, way back.


942
00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.798
我们邀请理查德•威廉姆斯执导
We asked Richard Williams to direct the film,


943
00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:04.733
他未答应, 但引荐了他的学生理查德•波德姆
but Williams declined and recommended one of his proteges, Richard Purdum, to direct instead.


944
00:46:04.878 --> 00:46:08.746
波德姆是英国非常成功的广告导演
Purdum was a very successful commercial director based in the U.K.


945
00:46:08.882 --> 00:46:12.083
然后马站起身, 把他托了起来
And then the horse rises up right underneath him.


946
00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:14.847
现在他骑在马后面
Now he's riding on the rear end of the horse,


947
00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:16.456
死死抓住马尾巴
hanging on to the horse's tail,


948
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.151
这时一条狼也抓住马尾, 拼命不放开
and one of the wolves grabs up right onto the tail, yanks the horse,


949
00:46:20.294 --> 00:46:22.285
这时马突然转身, 把人甩了出去
and the horse rears up and throws the guy off


950
00:46:22.429 --> 00:46:25.660
他正好落在狼背上, 像骑马一样
and the guy lands on the back of the wolf, riding on the wolf.


951
00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:27.171
这是我第一次做制片人
It was my first job as producer


952
00:46:27.172 --> 00:46:29.030
希望尽可能做到万无一失
and I wanted to get everything just right.


953
00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:32.070
所以我召集一组人突击改剧本
So I recruited a commando story team of Disney artists


954
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:36.404
之后我们赶赴伦敦, 做出了无配乐版本
and we moved to London to set to work on a non-musical version of the story.


955
00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:41.009
六个月后, 我们把影片前20分钟放给杰弗里看
After about six months, we took the first 20 minutes of the film to screen for Jeffrey.


956
00:46:41.148 --> 00:46:43.343
我侄女给你答复了吗?
Has my niece given you an answer?


957
00:46:43.484 --> 00:46:48.683
还没呢, 我感觉她只是在耍我
Um, not yet. I think she's playing the coquette with me.


958
00:46:48.822 --> 00:46:50.255
别在意
Forgive her.


959
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.825
作品不算完美, 但最糟糕的结果又能怎样?
It wasn't perfect, but what was the worst that could happen?


960
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.293
总不至于直接枪毙, 推倒重来 那就太疯狂了
They weren't gonna scrap it and start over again. That would be just insane.


961
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.661
我们很不满意, 所以直接毙掉了
It didn't work at all for us, so we literally scrapped it,


962
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.462
样片完全无法接受, 我们决定推倒重来
the first 20 minutes of the movie, and started all over again.


963
00:47:02.603 --> 00:47:05.504
波德姆又继续执导了几个月
Richard Purdum worked for a few more months on Beauty and the Beast,


964
00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:09.166
但当他发现根本无法契合公司要求时
and when it became clear that we would never make his version of the movie,


965
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.436
他选择了辞职
he resigned.


966
00:47:10.577 --> 00:47:13.978
我招聘了两名年轻的分镜师作代理导演
I recruited two young story artists to be the acting directors


967
00:47:14.114 --> 00:47:17.015
并把整个制作组搬回了美国
and moved the entire project back to the warehouses in Burbank.


968
00:47:17.151 --> 00:47:19.176
聚光灯突然打到我和盖里
The spotlight kind of turned on me and Gary,


969
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.811
感觉简直难以置信, 因为…
which struck us as incredibly odd, because--


970
00:47:21.955 --> 00:47:24.788
这种意外感, 就好比你打开厨房灯
The spotlight turned on us like when you turn on the kitchen light


971
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:27.393
突然照到了地上的蟑螂 惊慌失措下喊道: 什么情况?
and the roaches are on the floor. We were like,"What?"


972
00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:31.254
我们来不及逃, 终究是给逮到了
We didn't get away in time and they caught us.


973
00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:34.993
因此我们就成了美女与野兽的代理导演
So we were made kind of the acting directors of Beauty and the Beast,


974
00:47:35.135 --> 00:47:37.035
说白了, 我们就是片子的导演
which meant-- We had to act like directors.


975
00:47:37.638 --> 00:47:39.385
同时, 在加利福尼亚
Meanwhile, back in California,


976
00:47:39.386 --> 00:47:41.540
杰弗里正开着年度沙滩派对
Jeffrey threw his annual beach party.


977
00:47:41.675 --> 00:47:45.304
嘉宾包括汤姆•克鲁斯, 贝蒂•米勒和罗宾•威廉姆斯
And there was Tom Cruise and Bette Midler and Robin Williams,


978
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:48.074
大家聚在杰弗里豪宅的沙滩上
all on the beach at Jeffrey's house.


979
00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:50.046
记得霍华德当时也在场
And I remember being there with Howard Ashman,


980
00:47:50.184 --> 00:47:53.245
当时他刚完成小美人鱼,
because after Little Mermaid,


981
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:56.051
正对新片阿拉丁跃跃欲试
Howard asked to go work on this other thing he was desperate to do for Disney called Aladdin,


982
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.750
恰好同时, 伦敦的美女与野兽项目遭遇困境
at exactly the same time Beauty and the Beast was sort of falling apart in London.


983
00:47:59.893 --> 00:48:02.691
杰弗里强迫霍华德, 也只有他敢这么做
Jeffrey buttonholed Howard, as only he can,


984
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.663
说服他为美女与野兽作曲
and convinced Howard to write the songs for Beauty and the Beast


985
00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:07.426
尽管霍华德并非心甘情愿
even though Howard didn't really want to.


986
00:48:07.835 --> 00:48:09.962
当时老大打电话过来说:
Well, we got a phone call from our boss.


987
00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:14.370
我要介绍你们认识霍华德, 艾伦还有整个创意团队
"We want you to meet with Howard and Alan and the whole creative team


988
00:48:14.508 --> 00:48:16.525
还有美女与野兽将成为一部音乐片
and Beauty and the Beast is gonna become a musical."


989
00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.534
我们都跌破了眼镜
We couldn't believe it.


990
00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:20.993
最后我们把办公室设在了一家旅馆
So we ended up setting up shop at the Residence Inn,


991
00:48:20.994 --> 00:48:23.748
在纽约北部, 离霍华德家很近
upstate New York, in Howard's neck of the woods.


992
00:48:23.884 --> 00:48:26.580
我们开始大量的讨论, 抛出各种想法
And we started hashing stuff out and throwing around ideas.


993
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.917
刚开始, 讨论就像学生社团开会一样热闹
Initially it was very, very collegial. It was very upbeat.


994
00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:31.183
我们都觉得很开心
We were having a lot of fun.


995
00:48:31.325 --> 00:48:33.259
但我们遇到了棘手的问题
But one of the things that was a sticking point,


996
00:48:33.394 --> 00:48:36.591
对于影片的开幕, 我们无法达成共识
something that we didn't agree on, was how to open the movie.


997
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.198
霍华德强烈要求电影以动物形态开场
And Howard felt very passionately that the movie should open with a fully animated prologue


998
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:45.704
展现野兽形态的王子, 而不是小男孩
that showed the Beast in his prince form, except he would be a little boy.


999
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.069
顽皮的小男孩
He'd be a naughty little boy.


1000
00:48:48.208 --> 00:48:52.577
而我和盖里, 我们深受怪物一家人中小男孩埃迪的影响
And to Gary and I, we could not get past this Eddie Munster image,


1001
00:48:52.713 --> 00:48:57.844
就是那个穿着少爷裤的小毛孩
you know, of this hairy little kid in Little Lord Fauntleroy pants.


1002
00:48:57.985 --> 00:49:01.785
而霍华德觉得这很悲伤和不幸
To Howard, it seemed incredibly moving and tragic.


1003
00:49:01.922 --> 00:49:06.422
而且他很固执己见, 能言善辩, 有些吓人
He was also very opinionated and very articulate and very intimidating.


1004
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.690
所以我们都有些怕他 只好说: 好吧, 按你说的做
And so we were scared of him. It's like, "Okay, we gotta do this."


1005
00:49:10.831 --> 00:49:15.234
当时窝着一肚子火的我, 真是很傻很天真
And so, you know, like the stupid, naive, 26-year-old kid that I was,


1006
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:17.200
会议开始, 我说道:
I opened the meeting with,


1007
00:49:17.337 --> 00:49:22.604
人形小男孩的开场还是有些轻蔑
"We think that the little Beast boy is kind of a cheap shot."


1008
00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:27.639
我想, “轻蔑”这个字眼把霍华德惹毛了
And I think the word "Cheap" Really set Howard off.


1009
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:29.510
他的嘴紧紧抿成一条线
And his mouth was a very tight line


1010
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.277
眼睛瞪得很大
and his eyes were getting kind of bigger.


1011
00:49:31.418 --> 00:49:33.852
仿佛能看见他头上的乌云
I just saw the clouds darken.


1012
00:49:33.987 --> 00:49:35.978
他的脸也阴沉沉的
I just saw his face darken.


1013
00:49:36.123 --> 00:49:41.186
一种空前可怕的气场, 仿佛要撕碎我们
And he just ripped into us like I've never been ripped into before.


1014
00:49:41.328 --> 00:49:45.025
当时, 根本没人敢为我说话
And no one leapt to my defense, may I just add.


1015
00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:48.300
谢谢大家
Thank you very much.


1016
00:49:48.435 --> 00:49:50.494
奥斯卡奖得主是:
And the Oscar goes to:


1017
00:49:53.807 --> 00:49:55.104
艾伦•门肯, 霍华德•阿斯曼
Alan Menken, Howard Ashman


1018
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:57.802
获奖作品是小美人鱼插曲: 海底世界
for "Under the Sea" From The Little Mermaid.


1019
00:49:57.945 --> 00:50:02.712
颁奖礼那晚, 我们两人至少拿了三个奖
Oscar night, we won at least three Oscars between the two of us.


1020
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.978
他说: 回到纽约, 我们得好好谈谈
He said, "When we get back to New York, we really have to talk."


1021
00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:07.882
他星期一晚上说的这些
And so that was, what, a Monday night.


1022
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:10.649
星期四早上回到纽约
I think he was back by Thursday morning.


1023
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:12.759
我去找他谈话
I came in and he just told me.


1024
00:50:12.893 --> 00:50:14.594
我问: 什么事?
I said, you know, "What is it?"


1025
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.693
他说: 我以为你知道
And he said, "Well, I guess you know."


1026
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.958
我不知道, 我… 他接着说: 我以为你知道
I didn't, or I didn't let myself. He said, "I guess you know.


1027
00:50:20.868 --> 00:50:22.733
我得了艾滋病
I'm HlV-positive."


1028
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:25.964
或者是“我有病”之类的
I think, or he maybe said, "I'm sick," Or something.


1029
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.238
这真不是我想听到的消息
And I-- It was not what I wanted to hear.


1030
00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:38.048
感觉好像少了点什么
It seems like something falls out a little bit there.


1031
00:50:38.185 --> 00:50:39.516
是“歌声伴你入眠”这句?
On, "Sing you off to sleep"?


1032
00:50:39.653 --> 00:50:41.314
是, 就是这句
Yes. On, "Sing you off to sleep"?


1033
00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:44.084
唱的有点重
You're very strong.


1034
00:50:47.427 --> 00:50:49.554
这里应该删减下, 以补偿…
Something needs to take off there to compensate for…


1035
00:50:49.696 --> 00:50:52.164
我想大卫应该是觉得必须着重一些
Well, I know David had felt that it had to build back in.


1036
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:53.926
你好像说过
I mean, I remember you saying that.


1037
00:50:54.067 --> 00:50:57.059
你觉得不应该完全踩着节拍
That you didn't feel you should jump right into tempo.


1038
00:50:57.204 --> 00:50:59.399
你是想再加快点?
Do you want it to get faster sooner?


1039
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.598
你之前说…
You're asking--


1040
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:02.902
- 他有点带跑节奏了 - 这不是节奏的问题
- He's building into it. - This is not a tempo question.


1041
00:51:04.278 --> 00:51:05.404
- 大卫 - 我明你意思
- David - I know what you’re saying.


1042
00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:09.276
- 旋律很优雅, 真的很棒 - 好, 那太好了
- The melody, it's neat. It's really pretty. - Oh, good, good.


1043
00:51:09.416 --> 00:51:11.247
你不用声嘶力竭地唱这段
So you don't have to scream to get over it.


1044
00:51:11.385 --> 00:51:12.943
我们是分轨的, 对吧?
Well, we're separate tracks, aren't we?


1045
00:51:13.086 --> 00:51:15.452
没错, 我就怕你没听到提示
True. I just if wonder what you're hearing in your cans--


1046
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:19.286
我们试一遍大声, 一遍小声
Yeah, I'll play it up and play it down.


1047
00:51:19.426 --> 00:51:21.326
- 然后看哪个好点 - 好的
- We'll see which is better. - Great.


1048
00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:27.161
还有, 这部分也要这么处理
And similarly we should get at least one on this build section.


1049
00:51:29.937 --> 00:51:31.837
他对人有着不可思议的影响力
He was an amazing influence on everybody.


1050
00:51:31.972 --> 00:51:33.735
我不想拿他跟沃特对比
And I don't want to compare him to Walt,


1051
00:51:33.874 --> 00:51:35.429
但不管怎么说
but on the other hand,


1052
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.470
他确实有沃特一样强大的影响力
he had that kind of influence on everybody.


1053
00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:41.269
美女与野兽完工之前
Before Beauty and the Beast was finished,


1054
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.641
我们办了一场大型的演出会
we threw a big dog-and-pony show


1055
00:51:42.783 --> 00:51:45.308
邀请了纽约的媒体, 播放了一些电影片段
for the New York press where we showed some clips from the film


1056
00:51:45.452 --> 00:51:48.182
艾伦还唱了几首插曲
and Alan sang some of the songs.


1057
00:51:48.555 --> 00:51:52.116
我们真的很难想象
I don't think we could have ever imagined


1058
00:51:52.259 --> 00:51:57.196
电影和歌曲的受欢迎程度
a more enraptured reception to the movie and the songs.


1059
00:51:57.331 --> 00:52:01.028
我们都迫不及待地想与霍华德分享这份喜悦
And we all were very excited about the idea of sharing this with Howard.


1060
00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:03.329
我们想立马告诉他这好消息
We wanted him to hear the news.


1061
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:08.699
我们跳上出租车, 穿过市区, 直奔医院
And then we all jumped in a cab and we raced downtown to St. Vincent's.


1062
00:52:10.077 --> 00:52:11.635
我们刚刚开完新闻发布会
We rushed from the press presentation,


1063
00:52:11.778 --> 00:52:15.236
一如既往, 发布会尽管简单, 但很成功
which, as rough as it was, was a huge success.


1064
00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:19.124
我们兴致火热, 迎来的却是冰冷的噩耗
We were high from it and we came into the cold shock


1065
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:21.018
霍华德病逝了
of Howard dying in a hospital room.


1066
00:52:21.955 --> 00:52:23.786
他母亲揭开白布, 让我们看见
His mother pulled back the sheets to show us


1067
00:52:23.924 --> 00:52:26.859
他身上穿的美女与野兽的T恤
the Beauty and the Beast sweatshirt that he was wearing.


1068
00:52:27.694 --> 00:52:33.155
临终前, 他瘦得皮包骨头, 双眼失明, 气若游丝
He was 80 pounds, had lost his sight and barely had a whisper of a voice.


1069
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:37.025
我们跟他分享了当天令人兴奋的故事
We shared with him what happened that day and how amazing it was.


1070
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.764
想着如果他在场该有多好
And how he was there in every way.


1071
00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.101
之后时间差不多了, 我们一一与他告别
Then, when it was time to leave, we said our goodbyes.


1072
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:46.508
离开前, 我躬身低语道
Before I left, I bent over and whispered,


1073
00:52:46.647 --> 00:52:49.309
美女与野兽如今风光无限
Beauty and the Beast was gonna be a great success.


1074
00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:51.644
“之前谁能料到呢?”我苦笑着说
"Who'd have thought it?" I said.


1075
00:52:51.985 --> 00:52:55.614
仿佛霍华德醒了过来, 低声回应: 我料到了
And Howard lit up and whispered, "I would have."


1076
00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:11.572
霍华德于1991年3月14日去世

1077
00:53:13.252 --> 00:53:17.190
他未能见到影片完成的样子

1078
00:53:24.685 --> 00:53:29.804
盖里•卡尔金当时负责影片推广,
Gary Kalkin, who was running Publicity at the time,


1079
00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:35.883
他想到个好主意 一个激进冒险的主意
had a brilliant idea, a scary idea, a dangerous idea that perhaps an unfinished


1080
00:53:35.884 --> 00:53:41.962
就是在纽约电影节放映未完成的美女与野兽
work-in-progress screening of Beauty and the Beast could be a part of the New York Film Festival.


1081
00:53:42.102 --> 00:53:46.300
后来我们真的放映了这部未完成版
So we actually screened an unfinished version of the film


1082
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.238
当时我们都心里没底
and I think we were all on pins and needles.


1083
00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:51.970
我们呆坐着, 屏住呼吸
We all were sitting there holding our breath,


1084
00:53:52.112 --> 00:53:54.672
因为实在拿不准观众的反应
because we didn't know what kind of reaction there would be.


1085
00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:58.046
影片放完后, 片场几乎…
And there was almost-- When the movie ended,


1086
00:53:58.185 --> 00:54:02.884
时间几乎停滞了一会儿
it was almost a pause where you went,"1001, 1002,"


1087
00:54:03.023 --> 00:54:07.119
然后突然像火山一样爆发了
and then all of a sudden the place just erupted.


1088
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:19.508
当时的我可谓错愕, 震惊
I remember just being absolutely slack-jawed, stunned,


1089
00:54:19.509 --> 00:54:23.371
瞠目结舌, 倍感意外
knocked over, goggle-eyed with astonishment.


1090
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:27.071
观众像看百老汇演出一样给予掌声
They applauded like they were at a live Broadway show.


1091
00:54:27.214 --> 00:54:31.173
这情形我一辈子都没见过
And I had never seen anything like that in my life.


1092
00:54:36.123 --> 00:54:38.557
但现在高兴还为时尚早
It was an emotional roller coaster back home.


1093
00:54:38.692 --> 00:54:41.217
美女与野兽还有无数的底稿要画
Beauty and the Beast had thousands of drawings left to go.


1094
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.591
阿拉丁的故事情节也遭遇大改
Aladdin was grinding through intense story changes


1095
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:46.358
霍华德之前写的三首歌也不得不弃用
that left three of Howard's songs on the cutting-room floor.


1096
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.596
新的歌曲由后来加盟的蒂姆•莱斯负责
And Tim Rice was brought in to finish up the lyrics on the new songs.


1097
00:54:50.737 --> 00:54:52.637
任务堆积成山, 而时间有限
The work was intense, the hours were long


1098
00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:56.334
唯一的疏解方式就是: 开派对
and there was only one thing that could stop it all: margaritas.


1099
00:55:03.817 --> 00:55:07.844
我尝试让自己投入到这个角色
I tried very much to put myself into this character.


1100
00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:13.815
这是大家在漫长枯燥的工作之余的减压活动
It was a way for everybody to decompress after the long hours and hideous meetings with Jeffrey.


1101
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.986
此时, 我们与同事相处的时间甚至超过陪家人
By this time, we spent more time with each other than with our families.


1102
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.995
办公室已经是我们的家
I mean, this was our family.


1103
00:55:19.132 --> 00:55:21.362
所以我们好好放松了一下, 吃了点零食
So we'd take a long break, have some chips and salsa,


1104
00:55:21.501 --> 00:55:23.488
听了点彼得的鸡汤正能量
and with a little cheerleading from Peter,


1105
00:55:23.489 --> 00:55:24.766
就回到了各自的工作
we'd get back on the horse.


1106
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:28.898
太棒了, 我们的团队最牛, 没有之一
It's great. This crew is the best crew. It's fabulous.


1107
00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:30.339
- 是不是有点假? - 确实
- Not very sincere, was it? - No.


1108
00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:36.007
赞美与功劳始终是重要话题
Credit was always an issue,


1109
00:55:36.149 --> 00:55:38.208
人们或是接受赞美
and it seemed that everyone was either taking credit


1110
00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:40.285
或不接受, 不赞美
or not getting credit or not giving credit.


1111
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.049
那些理应获得掌声的人, 却常被忽视
And the people who really deserved the credit were being overlooked.


1112
00:55:44.291 --> 00:55:49.438
也许对这个话题, 我比别人更敏感些
You know, maybe I was more sensitive to that in a way than others might have been,


1113
00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:55.163
因为我与沃特还有其他很多人共事过
just because I went through it with Walt and a lot of the guys that worked for him


1114
00:55:55.302 --> 00:55:59.238
沃特的光芒如此耀眼
and watched watch them be outshone by so much


1115
00:55:59.372 --> 00:56:02.933
而其他人则没有获得应有的灯光和掌声
and not given the kind of credit that they thought they deserved


1116
00:56:03.076 --> 00:56:05.237
而这些都是他们应得的
and certainly and in fact that they did.


1117
00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:11.348
站在人生的舞台上接受他人的闪光灯, 这很容易
It is easy to get out there on the stage of life and have people shining flashlights at you,


1118
00:56:11.484 --> 00:56:14.385
你只需要说: 哇, 不错, 我还行, 对吧?
and you're going, "Wow, yeah, I'm pretty good, aren't I?"


1119
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:15.879
好, 开始
And, action.


1120
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:19.355
大家好, 我是杰弗里•卡岑伯格, 迪斯尼工作室主席
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios.


1121
00:56:19.492 --> 00:56:22.484
在迪斯尼, 如果我们要拍一部长篇动画
At Disney, when we set out to make an animated feature,


1122
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:27.697
首要的就是寻找特别的故事和性格鲜明的人物
the first thing we look for is a very special story and unforgettable characters.


1123
00:56:27.834 --> 00:56:30.166
而美女与野兽就是这样的片子
And that's just what Beauty and the Beast is,


1124
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:33.397
精彩的故事和令人难忘的人物
a great story with unforgettable characters.


1125
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.598
停
Cut.


1126
00:56:34.741 --> 00:56:37.175
我不在乎荣誉, 完全不在乎
I didn't care about credit. I didn't care about any of that.


1127
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:41.041
人们对我的溢美之词从来没有断过
I had plenty of my own adulation from places I didn't even want it.


1128
00:56:41.181 --> 00:56:42.842
不管杰弗里怎样宣传包装自己
The more Jeffrey promoted himself,


1129
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:47.716
只要是为了动画电影好, 我就不反对
as long as he promoted himself around an animated movie, I let it happen.


1130
00:56:47.854 --> 00:56:48.946
罗伊则很不爽
Roy went nuts.


1131
00:56:49.089 --> 00:56:51.819
大家好, 我是罗伊•迪斯尼
Hello, my name is Roy Disney


1132
00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:54.859
很高兴向大家介绍我们全新发售的录像带
and it's my pleasure to introduce the home-video debut


1133
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:58.692
我叔叔沃特电影生涯最杰出的作品
of one of the greatest triumphs of my uncle Walt's filmmaking career:


1134
00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:00.959
白雪公主和七个小矮人
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.


1135
00:57:01.201 --> 00:57:04.364
沃特死后, 有个问题就一直悬而未决
There's always been that question, ever since Walt died:


1136
00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:06.233
谁是下一个沃特•迪斯尼?
Who's the next Walt Disney?


1137
00:57:06.373 --> 00:57:10.241
媒体需要一个魅力超凡的强势人物
The media demands a central charismatic figure.


1138
00:57:10.377 --> 00:57:12.937
我们也需要这种领袖来打开市场
And we demand it to sell our product.


1139
00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:15.843
大家好, 我是迈克尔•埃斯纳, 迪斯尼公司的主席
Hello, I'm Michael Eisner, chairman of The Walt Disney Company.


1140
00:57:15.982 --> 00:57:18.314
迪斯尼全体希望您能享受这次旅途
All of us here at Disney hope you enjoyed the tour


1141
00:57:18.451 --> 00:57:22.320
希望您能够更多地感受电影和电视的魔力
and that it gave you new insight into the magic of motion-picture and television production.


1142
00:57:22.455 --> 00:57:24.286
希望能很快再见到您
We hope you come back and see us real soon.


1143
00:57:24.424 --> 00:57:26.984
哇噢, 动画工作室这是怎么了?
Whoa, whoa, what is now going on in the studio?


1144
00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:31.092
弗兰克, 是我们中间最无私的
Frank, of all of us, was the most selfless,


1145
00:57:31.231 --> 00:57:40.502
因此他能够在日益滋长的自满情绪中带领大家
and so he was able to navigate a course between strong and growing personalities and egos.


1146
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.633
我觉得弗兰克是我们的中和剂
And I always found Frank the peacemaker, you know,


1147
00:57:44.778 --> 00:57:46.769
就像个婚姻顾问一样
that he was like a marriage counselor.


1148
00:57:46.913 --> 00:57:49.780
他总是扮演调停者的角色
He was very much of a mediator.


1149
00:57:49.916 --> 00:57:53.113
当你有困难, 通常会去找他
He was the person you ran to when you had problems.


1150
00:57:53.253 --> 00:57:55.744
有趣的是, 弗兰克的钱包里
Interesting thing about Frank, he carried in his wallet


1151
00:57:55.889 --> 00:57:59.825
有张纸条, 写着: 谦逊乃终极美德
a piece of paper that said, "Humility is the ultimate virtue."


1152
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.485
通常会有极激进和极保守的方案
You get it from the top and you get it from the bottom


1153
00:58:02.629 --> 00:58:05.154
最终还是会选择比较中庸的那个
and are often left floating somewhere in the middle


1154
00:58:05.298 --> 00:58:08.324
以保证方向和目标的明确
trying to establish a sense of direction and purpose.


1155
00:58:08.468 --> 00:58:14.069
美女与野兽首演那晚, 气氛有一些微妙
It was a delicate balancing act that began to wobble on the night of the Beauty and the Beast premiere.


1156
00:58:14.374 --> 00:58:16.934
我愿意做第一个
But I am delighted to be the first,


1157
00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:21.172
因为我真心以你们和你们的作品为荣
because I am so enormously proud of all of you and what you pulled off,


1158
00:58:21.173 --> 00:58:24.546
不仅仅是美女与野兽这一部电影
not just Beauty and the Beast,


1159
00:58:24.684 --> 00:58:27.118
而是整个过去七年
but over the last seven years.


1160
00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:33.348
对于当年惊惶的200人来说, 这简直就是奇迹般的转变
It is absolutely a fabulous change from 200 frightened people,


1161
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:37.187
那时, 大家都觉得马上就要丢饭碗
seven years ago, wondering if they were gonna have a job tomorrow.


1162
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.957
播放演职员表的时候
At the cast-and-crew screening,


1163
00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:41.124
依惯例大家会一一上台发言
there's tradition of everybody getting up and speaking


1164
00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:42.996
说些积极正面的话
and saying how great everything is.


1165
00:58:43.136 --> 00:58:48.938
我已经皈依这个信仰七年了
It's now been seven years since I was converted to the faith


1166
00:58:49.075 --> 00:58:51.976
并且一直在传扬这动画的福音
and I've been preaching the gospel of animation ever since.


1167
00:58:53.446 --> 00:58:55.490
直到那晚, 我才意识到
Until that night, I don't think I was aware


1168
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:59.208
迈克尔, 罗伊和杰弗里三人间的敌意有多重
to the extent of the animosity between Michael, Roy and Jeffrey.


1169
00:58:59.486 --> 00:59:02.546
大概是1983年, 我接到一个电话
Then about 1983, I got a call.


1170
00:59:02.689 --> 00:59:05.351
当时我在佛蒙特米德尔堡参加儿子的夏令营
I was in Middlebury, Vermont, at my son's camp.


1171
00:59:05.492 --> 00:59:08.222
接到罗伊•迪斯尼的电话, 他说:
I got a call from Roy Disney, who said,


1172
00:59:08.361 --> 00:59:11.592
你有兴趣加盟沃特•迪斯尼公司吗
"Would you be interested in coming to The Walt Disney Company,


1173
00:59:11.731 --> 00:59:13.562
因为我想重整旗鼓
because I'd like to keep it together.


1174
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.861
否则公司就要分崩离析了
It seems that it's gonna be broken apart."


1175
00:59:16.002 --> 00:59:19.995
我说: 嗯, 听起来还不错
And I said, "Well, yeah, that sounds like a good idea."


1176
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:25.134
没错, 当时我坐在第一排的边上
Yeah, and I was sitting right in the very first row in the corner seat,


1177
00:59:25.278 --> 00:59:28.076
看着他, 说: 宣布吧, 迈克尔
looking up at him, saying, "Announce it, Michael."


1178
00:59:28.214 --> 00:59:30.512
然后迈克尔站起来, 说:
And Michael stood up and said,


1179
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.108
为了庆祝这些年了不起的成长
"As part of the reward of this extraordinary growth,


1180
00:59:34.254 --> 00:59:36.085
回报大家伟大的付出
the amazing things you've all done,


1181
00:59:36.222 --> 00:59:37.988
弗兰克和我同意
Frank and I have agreed to


1182
00:59:37.989 --> 00:59:41.387
新建一座动画部大楼
build a new Animation Building on the Disney lot."


1183
00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:43.860
而杰弗里是第一次听闻这件事
It was the first time Jeffrey had ever heard that.


1184
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:47.455
那一刻, 我很愤怒, 因为我觉得
In the moment, I was enraged by it, because I felt,


1185
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.659
靠, 这帮家伙在搞什么?
"Wow, what are these guys doing here?"


1186
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:51.395
这不合适吧
It was inappropriate.


1187
00:59:51.538 --> 00:59:54.769
而言外之意就更深了
And the subtext to that was much, much deeper


1188
00:59:54.908 --> 00:59:59.242
绝不仅仅是失礼地宣布建楼
than just the faux pas of announcing a building,


1189
00:59:59.379 --> 01:00:01.779
而事先未跟我商量这么简单
you know, without having ever even discussed it with me.


1190
01:00:01.915 --> 01:00:06.215
这表明了由来已久的不和谐
And it just showed very deep-seated unhappiness


1191
01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:09.116
相互争权, 还有自负之心
and competitiveness and ego.


1192
01:00:09.255 --> 01:00:10.654
这完全是一个尊重的问题
It was all about respect.


1193
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.655
那晚, 杰弗里希望得到尊重
That night, Jeffrey was looking for the respect


1194
01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.589
他觉得他理应获得罗伊和迈克尔的尊重
he thought he'd earned from Roy and Michael,


1195
01:00:14.727 --> 01:00:16.490
但他没得到
and it just wasn't there.


1196
01:00:16.729 --> 01:00:19.630
惊喜两度降临于美女与野兽
Lightning has struck twice with Disney's Beauty and the Beast.


1197
01:00:19.766 --> 01:00:23.797
我已经词穷到不知如何形容这部电影了
I'm hard-pressed, had to go to the thesaurus to find all the applicable adjectives:


1198
01:00:23.937 --> 01:00:25.996
迷人, 令人陶醉, 扣人心弦, 有魅力…
Enchanting, bewitching, captivating, charming...


1199
01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:28.334
美女与野兽获得了巨大的票房成功
Beauty and the Beast opened to huge box office


1200
01:00:28.475 --> 01:00:32.639
还是自白雪公主以来最受好评的长篇动画
and probably the most glowing reviews of any animated feature since Snow White.


1201
01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:34.906
我陪孩子看了两遍美女与野兽
I've seen Beauty and the Beast twice with my children.


1202
01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:38.211
很快我会再看一遍, 这电影太棒了
I'm going to be back for more very soon. It's a winner.


1203
01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:40.444
我不敢相信自己有多爱这片子
I was amazed how much I enjoyed this movie.


1204
01:00:40.587 --> 01:00:44.551
之前听说它在纽约电影节放映时获得了起立鼓掌
I had heard reports that it played at the New York Film Festival to a standing ovation


1205
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:46.682
- 当时我不相信 - 我也是
- and I questioned those reports. - I did too.


1206
01:00:46.826 --> 01:00:51.090
我想说: 我才不信纽约电影节会为任何影片起立鼓掌致敬
I said, "I can't see the New York Film Festival standing up and applauding anything."


1207
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.519
看过电影后
Then I saw this movie and


1208
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.632
我才见识到其魅力
I heard it interrupted by applause again.


1209
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.400
获奖的是:
And the winner is:


1210
01:00:57.537 --> 01:01:01.633
奥斯卡提名之前颁发的是金球奖
Before the Oscar nominations came the Golden Globes.


1211
01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.671
美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast,


1212
01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:07.405
迪斯尼电影公司制作, 博伟影业发行
Walt Disney Pictures, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution.


1213
01:01:07.847 --> 01:01:09.007
当念到我们的名字时
When they announced our name,


1214
01:01:09.149 --> 01:01:12.380
我正坐在离舞台最远的桌旁
I was sitting at what had to have been the furthest table from the stage,


1215
01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:14.987
我身后就是会场服务人员了
back with the busboys and the valet-parking guys.


1216
01:01:15.121 --> 01:01:18.989
这个奖是我们始料未及的, 来自好莱坞的肯定
But this was a validation from Hollywood that we'd never really seen before.


1217
01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.086
也许, 只是也许,
And maybe, just maybe,


1218
01:01:21.087 --> 01:01:24.830
这意味着动画片不再是小孩子过家家了
this meant that animation was no longer at the kids' card table in the kitchen.


1219
01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:27.990
我们为杰弗里赢得了票房
We'd won the Bank of America award for Jeffrey


1220
01:01:28.134 --> 01:01:30.500
为艺术家们赢得了金球奖
and now the Golden Globe for the artists.


1221
01:01:30.637 --> 01:01:32.696
而锦上添花的还在后面
The icing on the cake was yet to come.


1222
01:01:34.874 --> 01:01:35.932
噢, 非常感谢
Oh, thank you very much.


1223
01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:39.135
刚才想必很多电视机前的动画师都乐坏了吧
A lot of animators just tossed their hot dogs and popcorn in the air at home.


1224
01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.907
所以这个奖真是大快人心
So you've made some people very, very happy.


1225
01:01:43.249 --> 01:01:46.377
- 我很荣幸宣布 - 好
- I'm pleased to announce - Good.


1226
01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:52.486
1991年获得最佳影片提名的是:
that the motion pictures selected as the Best Picture nominee of 1991 are:


1227
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:56.853
美女与野兽, 出品人: 唐•哈恩
Beauty and the Beast, Don Hahn, producer.


1228
01:01:56.996 --> 01:01:59.270
美女与野兽获得了六项提名
Beauty and the Beast got six nominations,


1229
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:01.490
包括最佳影片的提名
including a nomination for Best Picture.


1230
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.659
这确实创造了一项记录
Now that really sets a record here,


1231
01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.570
因为在迪斯尼历史上
because in the history of Disney,


1232
01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:08.765
仅有两部电影得过最佳影片提名
Disney has only had Best Picture nominees twice,


1233
01:02:08.908 --> 01:02:11.638
一部是欢乐满人间, 另一部是死亡诗社
once for Mary Poppins and once for the Dead Poets Society.


1234
01:02:11.778 --> 01:02:14.269
因此这对美女与野兽而言, 是巨大的荣誉
So that was a great honor for Beauty and the Beast.


1235
01:02:14.414 --> 01:02:16.439
我们听说美女与野兽获提名时
When we first heard that Beauty was nominated,


1236
01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:20.542
仿佛有一道电流传遍整个工作室
it was like an electrical charge that went through the entire studio.


1237
01:02:20.687 --> 01:02:21.745
我整个人都疯狂了
I just came unglued.


1238
01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:23.753
真的就穿着内裤跳起舞来
I did a dance around the house in my underwear.


1239
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.688
那一天我的电话一直响个不停
And my phone just rang for the rest of the day.


1240
01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:32.260
贺信, 贺电不断, 门前堆满各种糖果
Congratulatory messages and telegrams and boxes of candy were showing up at my door.


1241
01:02:32.398 --> 01:02:33.729
简直太疯狂了
It was nuts.


1242
01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:35.094
真是我美妙的一天
I was queen for a day.


1243
01:02:35.235 --> 01:02:38.466
我们穿着租来的燕尾服和晚装
We came to the Oscars in our rented tuxedos and fancy ball gowns


1244
01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:41.096
我脑子一片空白, 想着: 我们是怎么来到这里的?
and all I could think of was, "How did we get here?"


1245
01:02:41.241 --> 01:02:44.267
获得奥斯卡奖的是:
And the Oscar goes to:


1246
01:02:46.412 --> 01:02:48.903
沉默的羔羊
The Silence of the Lambs.


1247
01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:52.514
好吧, 那晚我们没有获奖
Well, we didn't win that night,


1248
01:02:52.515 --> 01:02:54.186
但之后的舞会真是太棒了
but, boy, did we get invited to the ball.


1249
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.346
第二天, 我们又回到工作
The next day, it was back to work.


1250
01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.491
- 嗨, 伙计 - 嗨, 罗恩
- Hi there. - Hi, Ron.


1251
01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:02.925
再介绍一下, 这是罗恩•克莱门茨
This is Ron Clements, once more.


1252
01:03:03.062 --> 01:03:04.859
他已经搬出了之前的小办公室
He moved out of his tiny little room.


1253
01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:07.159
- 正忙什么呢? - 阿拉丁
- What are you working on right now? - Aladdin.


1254
01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.860
这些是阿拉丁的草稿, 估计又要得奥斯卡了
These are sketches from Aladdin, another Academy Award winner.


1255
01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:13.166
谁知道呢, 对吧?过几年才会知道吧
Who knows, you know? You'll know better a few years from now.


1256
01:03:13.773 --> 01:03:15.604
阿拉丁的制作
By the time Aladdin came,


1257
01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:21.442
像马拉松一样, 考验的是生理的强度
the animation marathon was really beginning to tell on the physical strength,


1258
01:03:21.581 --> 01:03:23.640
完全拼的是体力和耐力
I mean, just in terms of endurance.


1259
01:03:23.783 --> 01:03:27.446
感觉就像: 怎么样, 长跑觉得怎么样?
Now there was this, "Okay, how are you in the long run?


1260
01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:29.111
还能坚持吗?
Can you keep going?"


1261
01:03:29.255 --> 01:03:33.055
很多设计师得了腕管综合症
Many of the artists had physical problems with their carpel tunnel syndrome.


1262
01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:37.993
记得有一天, 那天正好是赎罪日
And I remember on one day, it was the Day of Atonement.


1263
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:39.560
杰弗里走进工作室
Jeffrey came to the studio


1264
01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:41.760
叫大家跟他一起坐下
and asked everybody to sit down with him


1265
01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.665
然后说说与他共事的感想
and just tell him what it was like to work with him.


1266
01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:46.499
他说: 尽管实话实说
And he said, "Just be honest with me."


1267
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:51.206
于是大家开始吐槽迪斯尼工作的真实想法
People started to share what working at Disney Animation was really like.


1268
01:03:51.344 --> 01:03:52.743
有些人无法成立家庭
Some people couldn't have a family,


1269
01:03:52.879 --> 01:03:58.010
因为如此重压之下很难抚养孩子
because they really had no way of being able to raise kids in this kind of pressure.


1270
01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:01.211
而我, 端着咖啡杯, 手都会抖
For me, holding a coffee cup, my hand would shake,


1271
01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:03.049
抖得非常厉害
was just shaking so badly,


1272
01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:06.124
因为前一晚我通宵在做动画
because I'd been animating the whole night before.


1273
01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:10.093
这是我唯一一次见杰弗里眼泛泪光
It was the only time that I had seen Jeffrey with a tear in his eyes


1274
01:04:10.229 --> 01:04:15.633
他为如此逼迫动画师们感到自责
from just being moved by what he was pushing the artists to do.


1275
01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:20.205
他还说: 这样不对, 你们必须有正常的生活
And he said, "This is not right. You have to have a life."


1276
01:04:20.473 --> 01:04:22.964
但是一切照旧, 实际上, 我们更忙了
Nothing changed. In fact, it got busier.


1277
01:04:23.343 --> 01:04:26.210
本来怪罪到杰弗里或迈克尔的逼迫是合情合理的
And it would have been easy to blame Jeffrey or Michael for pushing hard,


1278
01:04:26.346 --> 01:04:28.597
因为他们确实如此, 但要知道
because they were, but, you know,


1279
01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.146
艺术家们也在给自己施压
the truth is that the artists were pushing just as hard.


1280
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:31.561
获奖捷报频频传来
The rewards were pouring in,


1281
01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:33.343
我们必须不断超越自己
so we all kept trying to top ourselves.


1282
01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.113
一时间, 奖金领到手软
Suddenly, there were bonuses


1283
01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:38.553
停车场也挤满了宝马和保时捷
and the parking lot was just full of BMWs and Porsches.


1284
01:04:38.691 --> 01:04:39.919
我们建起了新办公楼
We were getting a new building


1285
01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:43.256
我们开始有律师和经纪人, 开始参加脱口秀节目
and people were getting lawyers and agents and appearing on talk shows.


1286
01:04:43.396 --> 01:04:44.863
因为人们的注意力通常是眼睛
You always look into somebody's eyes


1287
01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:47.761
作画时, 如果犯错了
and if you're going to make a mistake in the drawing,


1288
01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.663
- 千万别出在眼睛上 - 没错
- don't let it be in the eyes. - Right.


1289
01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:50.996
这是大家所看重的地方
That's where everybody's reading it.


1290
01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:54.868
很有意思, 我本人作为画师, 也很明白
It's interesting, because that was also, personally as an artist,


1291
01:04:55.007 --> 01:04:56.201
当薪水上涨
when our salaries went up.


1292
01:04:56.442 --> 01:04:58.501
当大家都成了明星
When everybody became rock stars.


1293
01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:01.044
一切都仿佛不可阻挡
When it looked like you couldn't stop it.


1294
01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.377
尽管有所牺牲, 吃冷饭, 没时间陪家人
Even with the sacrifice, the cold dinners, the nights away from family,


1295
01:05:04.517 --> 01:05:06.109
我们仍像是活在梦里
we were living the dream.


1296
01:05:06.252 --> 01:05:08.777
- 涨, 涨工资 - 剪了这段
- Raises. More money. - Cut that.


1297
01:05:09.756 --> 01:05:12.850
迪斯尼成了动画界的圣地
Disney became the place to be for animation.


1298
01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.984
昔日员工如蒂姆•伯顿和亨利•塞利克回到工作室
Alumni like Tim Burton and Henry Selick returned to the studio


1299
01:05:16.129 --> 01:05:20.122
制作定格动画, 片名为: 圣诞夜惊魂
to make a stop-motion movie, The Nightmare Before Christmas.


1300
01:05:20.266 --> 01:05:22.791
彼得试图从皮克斯挖来约翰•拉赛特
And Peter tried to hire John Lasseter away from Pixar,


1301
01:05:22.935 --> 01:05:26.598
但约翰坚持留在这家处境艰难的初创公司
but John insisted on staying with the struggling start-up company.


1302
01:05:26.739 --> 01:05:28.070
彼得只好与约翰达成协议
So Peter struck a deal with John


1303
01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:31.176
由约翰执导合拍一部电脑动画
to direct a computer-animated co-production with Disney,


1304
01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.711
这是业界首创, 片名叫做: 玩具总动员
the first of its kind, a buddy picture called Toy Story.


1305
01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:37.515
当时在佛罗里达已经有子工作室了
There was already a satellite studio in Florida


1306
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:41.916
而巴黎的另一家子工作室正在制作高飞的电影
and now production started on A Goofy Movie at another studio in Paris.


1307
01:05:42.054 --> 01:05:44.989
百老汇也开始排演美女与野兽的舞台剧
Rehearsals began on the new Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast.


1308
01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:49.256
五年之前, 工作室的精力只够完成一部电影
Five years earlier, the care and focus was on one picture at a time,


1309
01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:51.761
而现在是五部电影和一部百老汇歌剧
and now there were five movies and a Broadway show


1310
01:05:51.898 --> 01:05:53.263
而且进展神速
in very active production.


1311
01:05:53.933 --> 01:05:55.833
大家都觉得心力交瘁
Everybody was spread too thin.


1312
01:05:55.968 --> 01:06:00.234
我才不在乎我是谁, 反正我自由了
I don't care what I am. I'm free!


1313
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.739
制造虚空可是违法的, 哈哈哈！
Offer void where prohibited by law. Ha-ha-ha!


1314
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:06.709
主人, 我觉得你还不太明白你所拥有的
Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here.


1315
01:06:06.846 --> 01:06:09.406
阿拉丁揭开了1992年感恩节长假的序幕
Aladdin opened on Thanksgiving weekend, 1992.


1316
01:06:09.816 --> 01:06:13.274
这是第一部票房超过两亿美元的动画片
It was the first animated feature to gross over $200 million.


1317
01:06:14.086 --> 01:06:18.180
这些影片再次成为了迪斯尼公司的心脏与灵魂
These movies became the heart and soul, once again, of The Walt Disney Company.


1318
01:06:18.324 --> 01:06:22.488
全公司围绕影片展开业务, 比如销售周边
The entire company rallied around them, sold merchandising,


1319
01:06:22.628 --> 01:06:25.461
电视转播费, 策划特别项目
put them on TV, made specials about them,


1320
01:06:25.598 --> 01:06:27.896
将人物加进主题公园, 加入公园游行队伍
became characters in the park, became rides in the park.


1321
01:06:28.034 --> 01:06:30.366
这是一段令人陶醉的黄金时代
It was an extraordinarily heady period of time.


1322
01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:33.529
我们简直无往不利, 点石成金
We could do no wrong. Everything we touched turned to gold.


1323
01:06:33.806 --> 01:06:36.172
电影票房屡创新高
Every movie was bigger than the last movie.


1324
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:37.970
很乐意见到人们开始…
And it was great just to see people--


1325
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.340
陈旧的观念 -- 动画片只是给小孩看的
The stigma of animation being just a kids' medium


1326
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.210
被这几部影片改变了
kind of get peeled away by these various films.


1327
01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.899
我们庆祝阿拉丁成功的时候
While we celebrated the success of Aladdin,


1328
01:07:01.033 --> 01:07:03.399
下一部影片的制作也开始了
the next movie was bearing down on us.


1329
01:07:03.536 --> 01:07:07.734
这是个被称为非洲斑比的有些老套的故事
It was a coming-of-age story that everyone called Bambi in Africa.


1330
01:07:07.874 --> 01:07:10.308
记得曾经看过一部纪录片, 片名是
I remember having seen a documentary called


1331
01:07:10.476 --> 01:07:13.411
永恒的敌人: 狮子与土狼
The Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas.


1332
01:07:13.546 --> 01:07:16.777
这片子紧张刺激, 充满力量和戏剧性
I mean, it was so incredibly powerful and dramatic and intense.


1333
01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:19.783
我想: 若我们的电影能够还原
And I thought, "Wow, if this movie could capture,


1334
01:07:19.919 --> 01:07:23.878
这纪录片的震撼力, 将会妙不可言
you know, a tenth of the power of this documentary, then it would be terrific.


1335
01:07:25.825 --> 01:07:28.794
他在打招呼, 他在跟你打招呼
He's just saying hello. He's saying hello to you, by the way.


1336
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.098
你看他们非常依赖触感
You notice that they are very contact-oriented.


1337
01:07:33.232 --> 01:07:36.827
他跑到人脚边然后…
He just walked under this man's leg just then.


1338
01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:40.063
今天, 这黄色胶带真的代表警戒小心
And in this case, the yellow caution tape really does mean caution.


1339
01:07:40.206 --> 01:07:42.003
影片制作了几个月后
We'd been working on it for a couple of months,


1340
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.234
杰弗里组织了一次早餐会
and then Jeffrey calls a breakfast meeting.


1341
01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:48.245
风中奇缘和狮子王的制作人员全数参会
And in the meeting, we have the whole crew from Pocahontas and Lion King.


1342
01:07:48.381 --> 01:07:50.406
杰弗里说: 风中奇缘就像全垒打
And Jeffrey says, "Pocahontas is a home run.


1343
01:07:50.716 --> 01:07:52.017
这是个西区故事
It's West Side Story,


1344
01:07:52.018 --> 01:07:54.743
是北美印第安版的罗密欧与朱丽叶
it's Romeo and Juliet with American Indians.


1345
01:07:54.887 --> 01:07:57.447
它必然会成功, 注定不会失败
It's a hit. It's got hit written all over it.


1346
01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.718
至于狮子王, 只能算是试验之作吧
Lion King, on the other hand, is kind of an experiment.


1347
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.421
我们真不确定人们是否会喜欢
We don't really know if anybody's gonna really wanna see it."


1348
01:08:04.564 --> 01:08:05.606
那次会后
And after that meeting,


1349
01:08:05.607 --> 01:08:07.692
当然无人愿意参与制作狮子王了
absolutely no one wanted to work on Lion King.


1350
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:11.860
没人对狮子王有信心, 这实际上…
No one had any faith in that movie, which is, actually--


1351
01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:16.373
谈到狮子王阐释的道理, 应该是: 人皆有可取之处
If there's a lesson in The Lion King, it's "Nobody knows nothing."


1352
01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.506
开篇辛巴出现在一片荫蔽的林地
We start with Simba in a secluded glade.


1353
01:08:18.507 --> 01:08:20.104
他好像在思考人生
He's kind of contemplating life,


1354
01:08:20.246 --> 01:08:22.407
他抬头望着天空和星星, 然后…
when he looks up and sees the stars and is reminded...


1355
01:08:22.548 --> 01:08:27.986
故事的核心观念是我想出来的
The kernel of that idea is something that actually originated with me.


1356
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.454
人的一生总会有那些关键的时刻
It was really about that moment in each of our lives


1357
01:08:32.592 --> 01:08:34.958
突然间我们会长大并学会担当责任
in which we sort of have to grow up and take responsibility.


1358
01:08:35.094 --> 01:08:37.619
在生命的轨迹上找到自己的位置
We have to take our place in the circle of life.


1359
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:44.296
这是一则关于年轻人承担使命和未来的寓言
It's allegorically a young person born with a future that's to be fulfilled,


1360
01:08:44.437 --> 01:08:47.531
他历经劫难到达目的地
who has to go through a lot of difficulties to get there,


1361
01:08:47.673 --> 01:08:51.234
更重要的是, 他学会了相信自己
and most especially, who has to learn to believe in himself


1362
01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:56.508
然后成功地完成了使命
before he can become what he is fated to be.


1363
01:08:56.649 --> 01:09:00.777
这是充满莎翁色彩的关于领袖责任的故事
It became more and more this Shakespearean tale about the responsibilities of leadership.


1364
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.253
很诡异的是, 它更像是一部自传
And in a really strange way, it seemed almost autobiographical,


1365
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:08.793
讲述了激烈竞争男权社会里边缘人的崛起
all about the brinksmanship that can arise in this competitive male environment.


1366
01:09:08.928 --> 01:09:11.556
我走出剧本讨论会场, 直奔弗兰克办公室
I came out of a story meeting and ran right into Frank Wells.


1367
01:09:11.697 --> 01:09:13.961
他问我: 狮子王进展得怎么样了?
And he asked me, "How are things going on The Lion King?"


1368
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.328
我说: 棒极了
I said, "Great.


1369
01:09:15.701 --> 01:09:18.192
简直是在拍摄我们自己的故事
We're making a movie about ourselves."


1370
01:09:19.338 --> 01:09:21.306
你的经历, 就是一段迪斯尼传奇
It's a Disney fantasy, your life.


1371
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.238
当时, 我从没想过会成为公司CEO
At the moment. I never thought I would be a CEO of a company.


1372
01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:25.776
从没想过会掌管迪斯尼
I never thought I would run Disney.


1373
01:09:26.145 --> 01:09:27.908
我希望此刻能够永恒
I'd like to freeze everything right now.


1374
01:09:28.047 --> 01:09:31.778
我想冻结时间, 我不想老去, 我热爱我的年纪
I'd like to just freeze. I'd like to stay my age. I like my age.


1375
01:09:32.985 --> 01:09:36.045
热爱妻子的年纪, 孩子的年纪
I like my wife's age. I like my children's age.


1376
01:09:37.156 --> 01:09:39.181
我很满意迪斯尼的运营现状
I like the way Disney is going.


1377
01:09:43.629 --> 01:09:45.722
我希望冻结此刻的人生
I'd like to freeze my life right now.


1378
01:09:48.334 --> 01:09:51.701
那是1994年的复活节礼拜日
It was Easter Sunday, 1994.


1379
01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:55.369
内华达宝石山上发生的一件事
And a single event in Nevada's Ruby Mountains


1380
01:09:55.508 --> 01:09:58.636
引发了一连串意想不到的变化
would set in motion an unimaginable chain of events.


1381
01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.508
直升机坠入峡谷约一英里处
The helicopter had flown approximately a mile down the canyon


1382
01:10:01.647 --> 01:10:06.584
然后撞在山腰7200尺位置
before it crashed into a rugged hillside at approximately 7,200 feet.


1383
01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:12.316
这是公司史上唯一一次直升机失事造成死亡
This is the only helicopter crash and the first fatality in the company's history.


1384
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:18.520
弗兰克·威尔斯葬礼

1385
01:10:23.402 --> 01:10:27.930
愿我们共同分担此刻的悲伤
There are some griefs that have to be shared.


1386
01:10:28.074 --> 01:10:35.304
共同分享此刻的喜悦
Likewise, there are some joys so overwhelming that they should be shared as well.


1387
01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:39.441
我们为弗兰克的离世而感怀
And while we all give Frank's death and grieve it,


1388
01:10:39.585 --> 01:10:42.577
为此生有幸与他相识而欣喜
we all share the joy of having known Frank.


1389
01:10:42.722 --> 01:10:45.953
今天, 我们在此缅怀
That is why we are here today, to remember--


1390
01:10:46.092 --> 01:10:52.924
缅怀, 歌颂和赞美一个拥有创意人生,
To remember and to celebrate, to pay tribute to one man who had magic


1391
01:10:52.925 --> 01:10:57.599
并乐意与人分享魔法的魔术师
and to share the magic with him through his whole creative life.


1392
01:10:57.737 --> 01:11:01.935
今天会场放的歌曲和音乐
The songs and music you have heard and will hear today


1393
01:11:02.074 --> 01:11:06.033
不是哀乐或挽歌
are not the songs of music of sorrow or of death.


1394
01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.614
而是弗兰克钟爱的歌曲
They are the songs that Frank Wells enjoyed--


1395
01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:21.391
是他钟爱一声的歌曲
These are the songs that Frank enjoyed during his life.


1396
01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.360
下面我要介绍
I would now like to introduce the man


1397
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:29.299
将我和弗兰克引入迪斯尼的人: 罗伊•迪斯尼
who thought up Frank and me for this job, Roy Disney.


1398
01:11:32.138 --> 01:11:33.901
就这么多?
That was it?


1399
01:11:43.849 --> 01:11:44.907
再补一句
My speaker's off.


1400
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:50.317
他是一个天马行空, 了不起, 不可思议的人
This is a fantastic, wonderful, unbelievable human being.


1401
01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:51.980
对吧?
Okay?


1402
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.952
好的
Okay.


1403
01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:59.527
弗兰克是这帮自大狂中间的调和剂
Frank was the peacemaker amongst all these tremendous egos.


1404
01:11:59.665 --> 01:12:03.931
他死后, 大家不知找谁倾诉
And when Frank died, there was no one to talk to.


1405
01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:05.536
不知道该说什么
Nobody knew what to say.


1406
01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:10.973
工作室笼罩着一种奇异的寂静
It was a very strange quietness that overcame the studio,


1407
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:13.578
大家心中在问: 现在怎么办?
just wondering, "Now what?"


1408
01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:18.649
这是一只幼狮
And that is a little baby cub.


1409
01:12:19.819 --> 01:12:21.753
现在看来非常可爱
And he is just the cutest thing.


1410
01:12:21.887 --> 01:12:25.448
但将来会长成750磅的大家伙
And this guy is gonna grow up to be 750 pounds.


1411
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:29.894
弗兰克死后
Ever since Frank's death,


1412
01:12:30.029 --> 01:12:33.294
杰弗里试图接手弗兰克公司董事长的职位
Jeffrey was lobbying for Frank's job as president of the company,


1413
01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.195
但罗伊不会坐视不管
but Roy wouldn't have anything to do with it.


1414
01:12:35.334 --> 01:12:38.462
他已经对杰弗里频繁亮相发布会颇有微词
He already felt uncomfortable with the amount of press that Jeffrey was getting.


1415
01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.333
我一直在领导这些电影制作
I was out front on these movies.


1416
01:12:40.472 --> 01:12:42.030
我一直在卖力宣传
I was selling the films.


1417
01:12:42.174 --> 01:12:46.372
电影越成功, 大家就越关注我
The more successful they were, the more attention came to me,


1418
01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:49.979
进而我又能为影片获得更多关注
the more I was able to get attention for the films.


1419
01:12:50.316 --> 01:12:52.944
他有点焦躁不安了, 快点拍
He's getting restless, so shoot away.


1420
01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:58.819
很好, 潘乔, 太棒了, 潘乔
Great, good. Pancho, good. Pancho.


1421
01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:01.017
当时, 我想很多人都好奇
At the time, I think many people felt,


1422
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.425
我这么做是对公司领袖的职位有所企图吗?
well, am I doing this for me and my own career?


1423
01:13:04.563 --> 01:13:08.260
我想迈克尔在方面对我构成很大竞争
I think Michael became very competitive with me at some point in this.


1424
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.164
他不满我所获得的关注和认同
He was uncomfortable with the amount of attention and recognition that I was getting for it.


1425
01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:15.273
罗伊应该也是非常不爽
I think Roy was extremely uptight about it.


1426
01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:21.777
一天, 杰弗里带着一名华尔街日报记者来到公司
Jeffrey was gonna come in with a reporter from The Wall Street Journal


1427
01:13:21.914 --> 01:13:24.576
记者在公司参观, 观察我们的电影制作过程
and he was gonna follow us around to show how the movie got made.


1428
01:13:24.717 --> 01:13:27.413
杰弗里亲自做了一些展示
And Jeffrey performed for the journalist


1429
01:13:27.553 --> 01:13:31.580
我们也演示了一小段电影制作的真实过程
and we created what looked like a slice of how the movie actually got made.


1430
01:13:31.724 --> 01:13:37.094
那篇报道中, 杰弗里被夸赞为迪斯尼动画的救世主
And in that article, Jeffrey was proclaimed the guy who was saving Disney Animation.


1431
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:41.029
我觉得这件事让我真的忍无可忍了
I think that was kind of a last-straw kind of a thing for me.


1432
01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:42.895
我感到很愤怒
I was just incensed by that.


1433
01:13:43.035 --> 01:13:47.096
这就是迪斯尼动画引以为豪的信条:
This is the vaunted Walt Disney Company's animation machine in action:


1434
01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:51.005
团结协作, 勇于挑战, 精益求精, 细致严苛
collaborative, confrontational, extravagant, exacting,


1435
01:13:51.143 --> 01:13:55.003
工作室在卡岑伯格先生事无巨细的经营下,
and under the meddlesome, protective hand of Mr. Katzenberg,


1436
01:13:55.004 --> 01:13:56.547
取得了辉煌的成就
wildly successful.


1437
01:13:56.682 --> 01:14:00.140
三十年代, 迪斯尼开创了动画电影这一类型
The studio that invented the animated movie in the 1930s,


1438
01:14:00.286 --> 01:14:03.983
后来曾一度低迷, 但如今已重回巅峰
but stumbled badly in the past decades, is back with a vengeance.


1439
01:14:04.123 --> 01:14:07.149
近些年, 它制作了一系列无可匹敌的重磅大作
It has produced an unparalleled string of blockbusters,


1440
01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:10.820
从小美人鱼到美女与野兽, 到阿拉丁
from The Little Mermaid to Beauty and the Beast to Aladdin.


1441
01:14:10.963 --> 01:14:14.592
实际上, 若考虑电影相关的周边商品
In fact, counting ancillary activities like merchandising,


1442
01:14:14.733 --> 01:14:17.725
音箱制品和主题公园
video sales and theme-park attractions,


1443
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:20.103
迪斯尼的动画电影
Disney's animated movies are simply


1444
01:14:20.104 --> 01:14:24.075
将是娱乐产业有史以来最成功的产品
the most successful products in the history of the entertainment business.


1445
01:14:25.577 --> 01:14:27.898
拉斯维加斯周日晚间上演了
It was the president of Walt Disney Studios


1446
01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:30.607
迪斯尼老总对阵丛林之王的好戏
versus the king of the jungle in Las Vegas Sunday night.


1447
01:14:30.749 --> 01:14:34.515
有惊无险, 杰弗里•卡岑伯格没有命丧狮口
And luckily, Jeffrey Katzenberg can live to laugh about it.


1448
01:14:34.653 --> 01:14:36.883
其实, 我知道最后的…
You know, the final moment that was literally--


1449
01:14:37.022 --> 01:14:38.455
不出意料
And I knew it, the day it happened.


1450
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:40.455
压死骆驼的最后一根稻草
the straw that broke the camel's back is


1451
01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:47.623
是里奇•特纳发表在华尔街日报上关于狮子王的文章
there was an article that Rich Turner wrote in The Wall Street Journal about Lion King.


1452
01:14:47.766 --> 01:14:52.965
很有意思, 那天我早上起床
And it was so interesting, because when I got up in the morning,


1453
01:14:53.105 --> 01:14:55.198
看了那份报纸, 真是一大清早
I read the paper, you know, very early in the morning


1454
01:14:55.341 --> 01:14:57.969
我还记得出门去上班前我对太太说:
and I remember saying to Marilyn before I left for work, I said,


1455
01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:03.708
一切都完了, 这文章太要命了
"Well, this is over. This is the nail in my coffin."


1456
01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:09.786
距离正点还有22分钟
It is now 22 minutes before the hour.


1457
01:15:09.787 --> 01:15:13.286
我已经50多岁了, 但每当迪斯尼出新片,
I'm over 50 years old and every time Disney comes out with a new animated movie,


1458
01:15:13.287 --> 01:15:15.120
我都迫不及待地一睹为快
I rush off to see it.


1459
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.455
本周我们将在读感受迪斯尼的魔力
And all this week, we're gonna be looking at the magic


1460
01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.394
他们的新片即将上映
that has created the new Disney animated feature.


1461
01:15:20.532 --> 01:15:22.056
片名为: 狮子王
It is called The Lion King.


1462
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:23.828
你们在不断尝试, 试验
So you all test this, these things.


1463
01:15:23.969 --> 01:15:26.199
说说吧, 能否稍微透露一下
Tell me, give me a little-- Give me a taste.


1464
01:15:26.338 --> 01:15:28.135
你们用狮子王做了哪些试验?
What is the test on The Lion King?


1465
01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:30.537
首先我不相信科研, 从不
First of all, we don't believe in research. I never have.


1466
01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:31.768
- 真的吗? - 真的
- Really? - Never.


1467
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:35.971
竟然有人说, 这是我们有史以来最大胆的试验之作
That being said, it's the highest-tested film we have ever had.


1468
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.412
很自豪能够成为制作组的成员
I'm very proud to be part of it.


1469
01:15:37.549 --> 01:15:42.213
很荣幸能够参与延续迪斯尼动画的光辉传统
And to be proud part of that great tradition of Disney animated features.


1470
01:15:42.354 --> 01:15:44.489
哈库纳玛塔塔, 毫无疑问
Hakuna matata, which of course,


1471
01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:47.314
是斯瓦希里语“5亿全球票房”的意思
in Swahili, means"500 million worldwide."


1472
01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:50.792
实际上, 哈库纳玛塔塔是斯瓦希里语“无忧无虑”的意思
Actually, hakuna matata, in Swahili, does mean" No worries."


1473
01:15:50.929 --> 01:15:53.295
不过, 鉴于狮子王红到发紫的热度
And, boy, judging from the success of The Lion King,


1474
01:15:53.432 --> 01:15:55.280
说5亿票房也毫不为过
it is safe to say that at this point,


1475
01:15:55.281 --> 01:15:59.203
迪斯尼动画工作室这回真的可以高枕无忧了
Disney Studios, which made the movie, has hakuna matata.


1476
01:15:59.338 --> 01:16:00.862
现在是洛杉矶现场发回的报道
We're live from Los Angeles.


1477
01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:04.339
现在上红地毯的是马修•布罗德里克
And here coming up on the red carpet is Matthew Broderick.


1478
01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.145
四年前, 我们下决心要拍好这部电影
About four years ago, we all decided we were gonna make it,


1479
01:16:10.282 --> 01:16:13.718
之后, 我们开始全身心投入
and so, you know, you fall in love pretty soon after that.


1480
01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:17.788
四年前, 我们还心里没底 不过现在, 信心满满
So four years ago, I would say, "Well, yeah," But now, it's great.


1481
01:16:17.923 --> 01:16:20.414
狮子王在好莱坞的首映礼上
By the time The Lion King premiered in Hollywood,


1482
01:16:20.559 --> 01:16:22.322
媒体已经注意到了一些紧张情绪
the press had picked up on the tensions


1483
01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:26.295
当时杰弗里谢绝了红毯上的所有采访
and Jeffrey waved off all interviews on the red carpet.


1484
01:16:27.866 --> 01:16:30.960
一次迈克尔与我共进午餐, 他对我说:
I had lunch with Michael and, you know, he said to me,


1485
01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:34.630
我不再支持你接任弗兰克了
"I'm not interested in having you take this job.


1486
01:16:34.773 --> 01:16:38.140
虽然我曾许诺过你会得到升迁
Even though I said I was and promised you that you were,


1487
01:16:38.277 --> 01:16:39.608
但我改主意了
I've changed my mind."


1488
01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:41.337
然后我对他说: 好, 我明白
And I said to him, "Fine, I understand.


1489
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.210
既然你改变主意, 也下了决心
But, you know, in changing your mind and deciding to do it,


1490
01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:47.284
也意味着, 我在此地已走到尽头
you know, it really says to me I have no future here."


1491
01:16:47.419 --> 01:16:50.718
杰弗里很有才干, 但他走错了棋
Jeffrey was a very good executive. He just played it wrong.


1492
01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:53.984
如果他安于工作室的岗位, 尽忠职守
Had he been happy to stay at the studio, stay in his job,


1493
01:16:54.126 --> 01:16:57.960
而不是在人尸骨未寒之际, 急于上位
not push everybody against the wall at a moment when somebody had died,


1494
01:16:58.097 --> 01:17:00.511
他早晚会得到那份职位
he would have gotten the job,


1495
01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:03.592
他只需要稍微耐心一些
had he just had the patience to wait.


1496
01:17:11.443 --> 01:17:13.536
- 你随时可以说了 - 开始拍了?
- Whenever you're comfortable. - You are rolling?


1497
01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:15.670
- 是的 - 好
- Yeah. - Okay.


1498
01:17:16.348 --> 01:17:21.081
公司众多业务中…
With all the many varied businesses this company is in, it is...


1499
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.348
剧组首次发布会就要到来了
The cast-and-crew premiere was coming up fast.


1500
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.481
依惯例, 我们会一一登台
It was tradition for all of us to get up on-stage


1501
01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.456
发表一番感谢辞
and give warm thank-you speeches.


1502
01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:31.119
但这次, 我决定用摄影机拍下大家的感谢辞
But this time, I decided to film all the speeches instead.


1503
01:17:31.263 --> 01:17:33.993
这些年完成了一些不可思议的任务
-an unbelievable job over the last decade,


1504
01:17:34.133 --> 01:17:37.000
狮子王是一座高峰, 我们将继续向前…
culminating in Lion King, and pushing forward...


1505
01:17:37.136 --> 01:17:39.416
不久后, 迈克尔突然胸口疼
Soon after, Michael complained of chest pains


1506
01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:40.632
被紧急送往医院
and was rushed to the hospital


1507
01:17:40.772 --> 01:17:44.173
在那里他接受了心脏搭桥手术
where he underwent quadruple bypass surgery.


1508
01:17:46.645 --> 01:17:50.547
这个, 我得… 我还没缓过神
All right, I gotta just-- Mind on other things.


1509
01:17:54.186 --> 01:17:57.815
他招募弗兰克和迈克尔进公司十年后
Ten years after he ushered Frank and Michael into the company,


1510
01:17:57.956 --> 01:18:00.220
动画业务已如日中天
and with Animation at the height of success,


1511
01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:02.327
而公司内部却隐忧重重
the wheels were coming off the car.


1512
01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:03.894
刚才没拍到, 对吧
You're not rolling, I hope.


1513
01:18:05.731 --> 01:18:07.289
开始吧
Anytime.


1514
01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:11.269
我想衷心感谢你们每一位
Well, I just wanna personally say thank you to everybody


1515
01:18:11.403 --> 01:18:14.964
你们再次创造了奇迹, 希望能再接再厉
for another absolutely incredible job on another marvelous movie


1516
01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.871
再创辉煌
on the way to the next great movie.


1517
01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:26.710
十年前, 我们刚来迪斯尼时
Ten years ago, when we arrived here at Disney


1518
01:18:26.852 --> 01:18:30.310
罗伊抓着迈克尔和我的手
and Roy took Michael and I in hand


1519
01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:33.686
领着我们走进动画部大楼二楼
over to the second floor of the Animation Building,


1520
01:18:33.825 --> 01:18:35.334
在那里, 罗恩和约翰
and with Ron and John,


1521
01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:42.059
向我们从头到尾展示了老鼠神探的原始故事构思
walked us through those initial storyboards for The Great Mouse Detective,


1522
01:18:42.868 --> 01:18:49.567
当时的我, 打破头也想象不到
there's not a chance in the world that with all the imagination I could muster


1523
01:18:49.708 --> 01:18:56.204
十年后, 此时此地的景象
that I could envision ten years later being here


1524
01:18:56.748 --> 01:19:03.779
十年间, 制作了各色影片, 与人谈业务合作, 经历过荣耀
and having the kinds of movies, collaboration and pride


1525
01:19:03.922 --> 01:19:12.527
作为迪斯尼动画这一卓越团队的一员, 我深感骄傲
that I feel having been a part of this extraordinary team called Disney Feature Animation.


1526
01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:20.366
对我来说, 这份荣耀令日复一日的工作不再单调
For me, it is what makes coming to work every day so special.


1527
01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:26.000
对于镜头前的大家, 我无法表达
And to all of you, I'm not sure I can ever tell you how much it means


1528
01:19:26.144 --> 01:19:28.977
我有多热爱成为你们家庭的一分子
and how much I love being part of your family.


1529
01:19:29.114 --> 01:19:34.950
我很骄傲能够参与制作这些世上最优秀的电影
And how proud I am to have been a part of these movies with the best in the world.


1530
01:19:35.087 --> 01:19:36.315
谢谢
Thank you.


1531
01:19:36.455 --> 01:19:39.947
狮子王上映后, 他辞职了
After the opening of The Lion King, he resigned.


1532
01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.217
随便去研究所, 大学,
Go to any institution, any university,


1533
01:19:44.218 --> 01:19:47.672
医院, 公司, 家庭, 房子看看
any hospital, any corporation, any home, any house.


1534
01:19:47.673 --> 01:19:48.691
知道吗?
You know what?


1535
01:19:48.834 --> 01:19:53.066
人的光辉永远会盖过屋宇的光鲜华美
The human condition overshadows bricks and mortar every time.


1536
01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:57.073
人类生活的主题永远是恐惧, 嫉妒, 安慰
And it's about fear and envy and jealousy and comfort


1537
01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.871
还有爱恨与满足
and love and hate and accomplishment.


1538
01:20:00.012 --> 01:20:01.775
任何地方都是如此
Every institution has it.


1539
01:20:01.913 --> 01:20:04.272
我们是不是一帮感情用事
Were we a bunch of artistic, emotional people


1540
01:20:04.273 --> 01:20:07.614
疯疯癫癫, 吵吵闹闹的所谓艺术家呢?
running around, screaming and crying and ranting and raving?


1541
01:20:07.753 --> 01:20:12.315
当然不, 实际上我们井井有条, 紧密协作, 我们常说:
No, it was an organized group of people working together, saying,


1542
01:20:12.457 --> 01:20:14.322
我们来露两手吧
"Let's put on a show."


1543
01:20:14.459 --> 01:20:16.212
曲终人散, 夜深人静之际
After all that drama, the late nights,


1544
01:20:16.213 --> 01:20:17.690
唯余残羹冷炙, 受挫的心灵
the cold pizza, the bruised egos


1545
01:20:17.829 --> 01:20:19.694
还有疏离于家庭的时光
and all those hours away from family,


1546
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:22.322
最终, 无人能忆起这恩怨情仇, 是非种种
in the end, nobody will remember who did what to who,


1547
01:20:22.467 --> 01:20:24.802
不朽的是剧中角色,
but they will remember the characters


1548
01:20:24.803 --> 01:20:29.241
他们生于画笔, 活于荧幕, 却永驻人心
who leapt from a pencil onto the screen and into the hearts of the audience,


1549
01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:30.771
一切亦本应如此
and that's how it should be.


1550
01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:36.677
迪斯尼卡通的魔力是举世无双的
I just don't think anything is quite as magical as a Disney cartoon fairy tale.


1551
01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:38.544
它完全不可复制
There's just nothing like that.


1552
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:26.756
下面是影片大结局
And now the grand finale.


1553
01:21:59.698 --> 01:22:01.757
- 琳达, 没憋着吧? - 没事
- Linda, do you have enough air? - Yeah?


1554
01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:04.095
敢动我试试 这里的感觉很棒
Try me. Just it feels great to be here.


1555
01:22:04.236 --> 01:22:06.796
我俩都喝高了, 给关进了牢里
We were both riotously drunk and we were thrown in jail.


1556
01:22:08.907 --> 01:22:12.343
好的, 高飞, 到你表演了
Okay, Goofy, let's see what you got.


1557
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.710
我就知道没好事
I knew something was up.


1558
01:22:31.163 --> 01:22:33.324
放我出去, 放我出去
Let me out of here. Let me out.


1559
01:22:33.465 --> 01:22:38.368
嗨, 我们现在以时速130公里
Hi. We're going 130 kilometers per hour here


1560
01:22:38.503 --> 01:22:41.631
穿行在法国乡间, 而且我没穿内裤
through the French countryside and I'm not wearing any pants.


1561
01:22:43.241 --> 01:22:44.572
迪斯尼, 最牛
Disney, number one.


1562
01:22:51.082 --> 01:22:53.346
我喜欢这里
I love it here!


1563
01:23:00.759 --> 01:23:02.920
好, 准备好了吗?先模仿伯吉斯•梅雷迪斯?
Okay, ready? Burgess Meredith first?


1564
01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.568
来吧, 阿拉丁
Come on, Aladdin.


1565
01:23:19.945 --> 01:23:22.038
别管我说的什么, 只管跟我走！
I don't know what I'm saying. Just go with me!


1566
01:23:26.651 --> 01:23:28.949
我还是有点害羞
I'm kind of a little self-conscious.


1567
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.014
差不多时间到了
It's about time it's coming out.


1568
01:23:33.158 --> 01:23:35.023
瞧
See here.


1569
01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.320
噢, 我的胸大肌
Oh, my breast.


1570
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.127
罗杰没有弱点
Roger has no weak spots.


1571
01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:46.294
我1945年入行 没错, 你就是四棒的脑残粉
I started in 1945. Yes, I called you the kiss-ass of cleanup.


1572
01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.996
噢, 天呐, 我说太多了
Oh, dear, I've said too much.


1573
01:23:48.139 --> 01:23:50.733
讲之前我想问个问题先
I'm gonna ask you a question before I continue.


1574
01:23:50.876 --> 01:23:54.073
我能提杰弗里•卡岑伯格的大名吗?
Am I allowed to mention Jeffrey Katzenberg?


1575
01:23:56.548 --> 01:23:57.879
让他穿件毛衣不就得了
Tell him just to put a sweater on.


1576
01:25:14.459 --> 01:25:16.654
我忘词了
I'm stuck for the rest of it.
