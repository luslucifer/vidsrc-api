Kakarrot...

2
00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.374
Kakarrot!

3
00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:46.300
"A Pair in Peril!
Super Warriors Cannot Rest."


4
00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:10.449
The craziness surges toward us,

5
00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:16.455
This is no time for tears.

6
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.418
I will raise my anticipations
a hundred-fold,


7
00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:27.466
And become our party's
leading man.


8
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.057
That which you can
lose yourself in


9
00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:40.521
Will someday make you
an incredible guy.

IPPAI OPPAI

13
00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:51.532
I am feeling fine.

14
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.535
The trouble is here,
so enjoy,


15
00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:57.538
You naughty little boy,

16
00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.374
We Gotta Power!

17
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:06.046
Dragon Ball Z!

RA

21
00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:17.057
Mother doesn't care.

22
00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:20.269
It's the century's end,
so twist and twirl,


23
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.063
You mischievous little girl,

24
00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:25.524
We Gotta Power!

25
00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:32.114
Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:54.136
Got it!

27
00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:00.225
Ta-da!

28
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.229
Wow, Trunks-kun, lucky you were there!

29
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.232
It's not like you can just go
running around recklessly!


30
00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:10.235
Yea, yea! The Two
-Star
-Ball!

31
00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:11.320
l found it!

32
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:29.212
Why do l have to
go through all of this?

33
00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:31.548
lt's your own fault for
springing out like that!


34
00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:35.010
And here l almost had the Two
-Star
-Ball!

35
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.512
How can you speak
to me in that way?

36
00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:39.348
You're the one who said you wanted
to see Shen Long, aren't you?


37
00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.517
lf you don't like it,
we can just go home.


38
00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:45.228
We can't go back now
after coming this far!


39
00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.231
Here it is! lt's here,
it's here, it's here!


40
00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:50.275
Inside this bird-san's nest!

41
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:10.545
There's a whole nest
of bird's nests here.


42
00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:14.549
All that's left is the
Four-Star-Ball, huh?


43
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.013
Trunks-kun, gathering the Dragon Balls was
a lot easier than we thought, wasn't it?


44
00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:23.517
That's thanks to the
Dragon Radar my mom made.


45
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:28.563
Aw, l wish l'd brought
a change of clothes.


46
00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:32.442
l sure want to get our
wishes granted soon!


47
00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.196
l'll be able to ride any ride l
want to without waiting in line!


48
00:05:36.197 --> 00:05:39.741
l want to have an amusement park
built where everything is free.


49
00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:42.452
What about you, Goten?

50
00:05:44.997 --> 00:05:46.581
l...

51
00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:52.587
l want to have a land made where no
matter how much l eat, how much l eat,


52
00:05:52.588 --> 00:05:56.299
l could never eat
all the cake and candy!

53
00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:04.015
Hold on, what's happening!?

54
00:06:04.016 --> 00:06:06.601
Goten, let go of the eggs, quick!

55
00:06:06.602 --> 00:06:09.187
Trunks-kun, the Dragon Radar!

56
00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:10.188
Hey, give that back!

57
00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:25.996
The last one is around here.

58
00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:28.206
Once we find it, we'll be
able to see Shen Long, right?


59
00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:30.000
l'm hungry!

60
00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:31.293
l'm getting so hungry!

61
00:06:35.214 --> 00:06:39.217
Wow, crystals!
They're crystals in the rough!


62
00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:43.638
How pretty! So beautiful,
it's enchanting!


63
00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.975
You girls have a weakness
for shiny things, you know!


64
00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:48.643
Hey, Goten, l'm coming too!

65
00:06:48.644 --> 00:06:51.605
l sure could pick a lot of
crystals from this area.


66
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.984
--Goten, Goten...
--Hold on!


67
00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.653
But if so many crystals
could be picked from here,


68
00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:01.364
how come that village looks so poor?

69
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.992
Were you thinking of leaving me here?

70
00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:06.661
Hold on! Wait up, both of you!

71
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:22.344
Our most noble God,
please watch over Natade Village!


72
00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:27.432
Ombachama, Jatchama...

73
00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:32.187
Cocoa...

74
00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:35.690
l'm sorry, please forgive me.

75
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:39.194
Grandpa, don't cry!

76
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.697
Cocoa...

77
00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:47.452
Ombachama...

78
00:07:49.163 --> 00:07:50.872
What's the matter?

79
00:07:57.713 --> 00:08:00.632
Who are you people!?

80
00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:06.179
l'm Videl!

81
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.181
l'm Goten.

82
00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:12.185
--Who are you, where are you from!?
--l've never seen them before!


83
00:08:12.186 --> 00:08:14.437
Where have you come from?

84
00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:18.108
From the sky!

85
00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:19.943
From the sky!?

86
00:08:19.944 --> 00:08:22.153
Don't you try to make fools of us!

87
00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:24.447
We're not trying to make
fools of you! See?


88
00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:28.743
All right!

89
00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:49.806
Ombachama Jatchama Yayakoni Totsama

90
00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:53.935
Ombachama Jatchama Yayakoni Totsama...

91
00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:58.732
The beast demands of us a sacrifice.

92
00:08:59.692 --> 00:09:01.943
The beast? A sacrifice?

93
00:09:09.952 --> 00:09:14.164
What, are you doubting us?
You have to be kidding!


94
00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:19.044
These two aside, l am a defender
of justice back in Satan City!


95
00:09:19.962 --> 00:09:23.089
Natade Village here has long
flourished because of our crystals,


96
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.134
but starting seven years ago,
it has been like this.


97
00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:32.140
Our curse! Our curse, Ombachama
our curse, our curse!


98
00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:38.146
Yayakoni Totsama!
Ombachama!


99
00:09:38.147 --> 00:09:41.775
lt is the curse
of the mountain god!


100
00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:54.788
Seven years ago, this area began
suffering under unusual weather.


101
00:09:55.164 --> 00:10:00.919
Even so, we bore it out
and made our lives here.


102
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.838
But there was a beast that suddenly
grew out of the mountains,


103
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.924
and when it had devoured all the animals,

104
00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:08.760
who were already dwindling
because of the abnormal weather,


105
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:12.931
it began to attack the village!

106
00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:16.309
What's more, it gets more
terrible every year.


107
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.645
The words of the Prayergiver-sama,

108
00:10:18.646 --> 00:10:21.773
which offers the sacrifice
to the mountain god,


109
00:10:21.774 --> 00:10:25.151
beg that he may rebuke the beast.

110
00:10:25.152 --> 00:10:29.948
Ombachama Jatchama Yayakoni Totsama!

111
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:32.158
That stuff is superstition.

112
00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:35.912
You can offer your sacrifice,
but nothing will change!


113
00:10:35.913 --> 00:10:38.123
Ombachama!

114
00:10:38.124 --> 00:10:40.208
Do not speak foolishness!

115
00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:44.963
Look at yourself! From the top of
your head to the tips of your feet,


116
00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:47.674
aren't you the notion of foolishness?

117
00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:48.133
lnsolent wretch!

118
00:10:49.635 --> 00:10:55.140
There is nothing left that we can do but
follow the words of the Prayergiver-sama.


119
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:56.141
That can't be...

120
00:10:56.142 --> 00:10:59.144
We have taken every
other measure we could.


121
00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:01.146
The young people of the village
have all become casualties


122
00:11:01.147 --> 00:11:04.941
fighting against the beast!

123
00:11:06.902 --> 00:11:10.655
lf this keeps up,
the village will be destroyed!


124
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.121
l will go! lf it will benefit
everyone in Natade Village...


125
00:11:18.122 --> 00:11:21.916
No way! A sacrifice, of all things!
lt's superstition!


126
00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:24.627
Ombachama Jatchama...

127
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:26.296
Ta-da!

128
00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:31.926
We'll exterminate that beast for you!

129
00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:35.638
ln exchange, once we
exterminate the beast,


130
00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:38.933
we'll take the necklace you have
on your chest, okay, Mister?


131
00:11:40.936 --> 00:11:45.106
l'm hungry! Can l eat
one of these offerings?


132
00:11:45.107 --> 00:11:46.107
No!

133
00:11:46.108 --> 00:11:47.942
But l haven't had anything since morning!

134
00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:49.110
Shh! Be quiet!

135
00:11:51.113 --> 00:11:53.656
l'm hungry too!

136
00:11:53.657 --> 00:11:58.119
You guys are too loud. You can
leave this up to me and go home.


137
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.372
We wanted to see you get
eaten by the beast, though!


138
00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:04.876
You what!?

139
00:12:12.968 --> 00:12:16.971
--We're hungry! We're hungry!
--We're hungry! We're hungry!


140
00:12:18.098 --> 00:12:20.433
l can't stand this!

141
00:12:28.108 --> 00:12:29.984
--Me too!
--No!


142
00:12:38.118 --> 00:12:40.620
Sis, you hit me!

143
00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:42.121
That's because you wouldn't listen to me.

144
00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:50.088
You only hit me, when you
let Trunks-kun have some!


145
00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:54.634
Why did you only hit me!?

146
00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:59.013
Be quiet! The beast
will hear us, you know!


147
00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:04.102
You let Trunks-kun have one!
Why didn't you hit him!?


148
00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:10.275
You only hit me! lt hurt,
you know! lt hurt!!


149
00:13:53.068 --> 00:13:56.237
Kakarrot-o!

150
00:14:02.077 --> 00:14:04.621
Why won't you let me have any!?

151
00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:07.624
All right! But just one.

152
00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:11.294
You didn't give me any!

153
00:14:14.089 --> 00:14:15.381
Here.

154
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:30.396
Sis, you're still far too lax!
You've fallen for Goten's crocodile tears!


155
00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:39.697
lt's here!

156
00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:52.210
Now!

157
00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:01.886
You're the one who's been causing
harm to the village, are you?


158
00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:04.847
I, Videl-sama, will put you down!

159
00:15:12.147 --> 00:15:16.943
Trunks-kun, looks like
the beast was a dinosaur!


160
00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:22.657
lt sure roars like the
real thing, doesn't it?


161
00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:26.160
l wonder if it breathes fire.

162
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.164
Get away from it!

163
00:15:32.126 --> 00:15:33.334
It's too much for you to handle!

164
00:15:37.172 --> 00:15:38.172
You see me?

165
00:15:43.095 --> 00:15:45.179
Whee! Whee!

166
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.181
Cool! Cool! Cool!

167
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.311
We don't have these kinds at Mt. Paozu!

168
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:12.999
These claws are pretty long, huh?

169
00:16:16.587 --> 00:16:20.506
You behave yourself. We aren't going to
make this too painful for you, okay?


170
00:16:32.102 --> 00:16:34.228
What kind of kids are these?

171
00:16:44.073 --> 00:16:48.576
Ah, now Natade Village will be
a peaceful village once again.


172
00:16:48.577 --> 00:16:53.247
Videl-san, Trunks-san, Goten-san,
thank you so very much!


173
00:16:56.085 --> 00:16:58.544
lt was easy, easy, right Goten?

174
00:16:58.545 --> 00:17:00.254
lt sure was.

175
00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:06.260
Thanks, Mister.
Ombachama Ja... how did it go?


176
00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:44.382
They've completely forgotten about
looking for the Dragon Balls.


177
00:17:59.273 --> 00:18:05.278
Ombachama Jatchama,

178
00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:10.032
Yayakoni Totsama!

179
00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:39.061
Ombachama Ja'koni Totsama!

180
00:18:39.062 --> 00:18:43.691
O
- Ombachama Jatchama!

181
00:19:16.058 --> 00:19:18.392
What are you doing,
this early in the morning!?


182
00:19:37.537 --> 00:19:41.207
Why are you doing this so suddenly!?
You aren't getting away with it!


183
00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:55.263
Mister! l'm not a very good riser!

184
00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:11.237
Kakarrot...

185
00:20:11.238 --> 00:20:16.033
What's that, what's that? A Kakarrot?
l've never eaten anything like that.


186
00:20:16.034 --> 00:20:18.494
Kakarrot-o!

187
00:20:18.495 --> 00:20:21.080
l've never eaten anything like that!

188
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.209
Hm? An incredible Ki!

189
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.210
l- it couldn't be!

190
00:21:26.229 --> 00:21:29.231
You're no match for our agility!

191
00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:30.483
That's right!

192
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.240
Looks like he's not going to chase
us anymore, huh, Trunks-kun?


193
00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:41.535
He's tired and has to rest.
He's an adult, after all.


194
00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:17.571
How could a guy
like that be on Earth!?

195
00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:19.365
There really is always
something above the top.


196
00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:53.190
l- it wasn't supposed to be like this!

197
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:54.358
Yeah.

198
00:23:06.204 --> 00:23:07.621
W- what's the matter, Goten?

199
00:23:07.622 --> 00:23:11.709
T- Trunks-kun, over there!
Over there, over there!


200
00:23:12.002 --> 00:23:13.669
There, at his feet...

201
00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:22.261
Yeah?

202
00:23:22.262 --> 00:23:26.182
lt's there! The Four-Star-Ball!
lf we had that...


203
00:23:26.183 --> 00:23:27.641
lf we had that...

204
00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:28.434
--We could request Shen Long
--We could request Shen Long


205
00:23:28.435 --> 00:23:31.645
--to really give it to that monster!
--to really give it to that monster!


206
00:23:35.192 --> 00:23:39.653
Goten, l'm going to draw
him away, so when l do...


207
00:23:39.654 --> 00:23:40.488
Yeah!

208
00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:48.204
Hey! Hey, fighting seriously against us
kids like this isn't very mature of you!


209
00:23:48.205 --> 00:23:51.790
lf that bothers you, why don't you
take your fighting down a notch?


210
00:23:53.168 --> 00:23:55.669
Come paddle my bottom!

211
00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:05.679
Now!

212
00:24:14.189 --> 00:24:17.191
Yea, the Four
-Star
-Ball!

213
00:24:17.192 --> 00:24:19.485
Yea! Yea, yea!

214
00:24:43.677 --> 00:24:45.344
The Four
-Star
-Ball is gone!

215
00:24:52.185 --> 00:24:53.185
Whoa! This is terrible!

216
00:24:55.689 --> 00:24:57.231
Goten, what are you doing!?

217
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:20.838
Why that guy, he's going
to pay for this now!


218
00:26:09.137 --> 00:26:11.221
Ah, that's better.

219
00:26:13.141 --> 00:26:15.934
And now, let's find the Four
-Star
-Ball!

220
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:35.788
Goten, come quickly!

221
00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:47.841
This isn't the one, this isn't the one,
not this one, this one either...


222
00:26:56.142 --> 00:26:57.976
Here it is!

223
00:27:16.121 --> 00:27:19.873
T- that monster, he's not
playing by the rules!


224
00:27:31.928 --> 00:27:33.971
Please go away quickly!

225
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:50.904
This is pathetic! If Dad saw me
like this, I bet he would get mad!


226
00:28:02.917 --> 00:28:05.377
l have to go pee now!

227
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.809
Trunks-kun! Trunks-kun!!

228
00:28:21.644 --> 00:28:26.690
Trunks-kun! Trunks-kun!

229
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.653
Trunks-kun!

230
00:28:31.654 --> 00:28:35.949
l found the Four-Star-Ball!
We have all seven!


231
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.951
Trunks-kun, where are you!?

232
00:28:37.952 --> 00:28:39.203
Ta-da!

233
00:28:42.957 --> 00:28:49.129
Hey you, monster! This is where your
life ends! We've got Shen Long with us!


234
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.132
Goten, hurry and ask Shen Long!

235
00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:53.967
Yeah!

236
00:28:53.968 --> 00:28:56.637
lf you're going to apologize,
now's the time!


237
00:29:05.104 --> 00:29:07.231
Shen Long, stick it to that monster!

238
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.988
Shen Long, defeat that monster!

239
00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:25.999
Say! Say, Shen Long!

240
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.087
l wonder if we broke it from
all that rattling around.


241
00:29:30.088 --> 00:29:32.297
G
- G
- Goten!

242
00:29:36.094 --> 00:29:39.638
Trunks-kun, Shen Long isn't coming out!

243
00:29:39.639 --> 00:29:42.015
W- what did you say!?

244
00:29:45.103 --> 00:29:49.189
l- l'm gonna get k- killed!

245
00:29:50.024 --> 00:29:52.734
Maybe it's because it's
too small in here?


246
00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:55.654
That's it, let's try going outside!

247
00:30:00.618 --> 00:30:02.786
How can this be allowed!?

248
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.060
l can't last any longer!

249
00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:43.076
l went.

250
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080
Trunks-kun!

251
00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:31.115
Kakarrot...

252
00:32:13.584 --> 00:32:16.753
Kakarrot-o!

253
00:32:17.171 --> 00:32:20.966
Kakarrot-o!!

254
00:32:34.188 --> 00:32:37.524
Broli! Are you still alive?

255
00:32:44.574 --> 00:32:46.825
G
- Gohan-san!

256
00:32:49.203 --> 00:32:54.207
Big Brother!

257
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.793
Whoa, Goten!

258
00:32:59.088 --> 00:33:02.591
lt's amazing you're in such good
shape after taking on Broli!


259
00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:03.925
Broli?

260
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:11.099
Who is this Broli?

261
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.229
The Legendary Super Saiyan
who Dad beat seven years ago.


262
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.233
That explains why me and Goten and
Big Sis Videl weren't any match for him!


263
00:33:23.071 --> 00:33:24.571
V
- Videl-san too?

264
00:33:24.572 --> 00:33:26.948
Kakarrot-o!!

265
00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:33.246
So that's it. You were chasing after Dad.
But Dad isn't around any more.


266
00:33:33.247 --> 00:33:36.917
So in my dad's place, 
I will defeat you!

267
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.269
Awesome!

268
00:34:00.566 --> 00:34:02.400
He's as bad a monster as ever!

269
00:34:02.401 --> 00:34:06.279
And here I'm supposed to have powered up
considerably since back then!


270
00:34:18.543 --> 00:34:20.460
Kakarrot-o...

271
00:34:28.553 --> 00:34:29.302
Videl-san!

272
00:35:24.066 --> 00:35:25.317
Big Brother!

273
00:35:58.267 --> 00:36:01.519
Not playing...
by the rules, all right...


274
00:36:10.529 --> 00:36:13.949
Gohan... -kun...

275
00:38:19.992 --> 00:38:23.953
That! That's the only
way l can defeat Broli!


276
00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:53.566
Now!

277
00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:10.250
T- that did it!

278
00:39:58.007 --> 00:40:00.049
Piccolo-san...

279
00:40:24.992 --> 00:40:26.659
Piccolo-san!

280
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:33.666
Heya!

281
00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:35.543
Kuririn-san!

282
00:40:37.171 --> 00:40:39.339
l wanted to try
my hand at this once.

283
00:40:43.969 --> 00:40:45.970
Lucky thing l made it in time, huh?

284
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:47.972
Kuririn-san, thanks!

285
00:40:47.973 --> 00:40:53.186
If you hadn't come, Kuririn-san,
I would have met the same fate as Broli!


286
00:40:53.187 --> 00:40:56.981
l have to be at least this much
use to you guys once in a while.


287
00:40:56.982 --> 00:41:00.443
For that Broli guy to follow
us all the way back to Earth,


288
00:41:00.444 --> 00:41:03.988
he must have really been upset
when he lost to Goku, huh?


289
00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:06.157
But this time, he's finished for sure!

290
00:41:06.158 --> 00:41:07.700
Right!

291
00:41:20.172 --> 00:41:21.172
l- it can't be!

292
00:41:31.684 --> 00:41:33.309
W- what kind of guy is this?

293
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:37.188
He sunk into that sea of magma,
and he's still alive!?


294
00:41:37.189 --> 00:41:41.317
l'm starting to quiver down to my
very center! This has never happened!


295
00:41:42.695 --> 00:41:46.239
No. 18, l'm sorry. You'll have to
take care of what comes after!


296
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:50.201
Kuririn-san!

297
00:41:50.703 --> 00:41:53.162
lt's always just me...

298
00:43:31.136 --> 00:43:33.596
Big...Brother...

299
00:43:58.914 --> 00:44:02.792
l am...the daughter...of Mister Satan...

300
00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:15.138
Videl-san!

301
00:44:19.643 --> 00:44:21.602
You bastard!

302
00:44:24.648 --> 00:44:27.233
That would be useless.
l'll put you to rest now!


303
00:44:36.118 --> 00:44:37.869
Kame...

304
00:44:39.913 --> 00:44:41.789
...hame...

305
00:44:43.917 --> 00:44:46.210
HA!!

306
00:45:00.642 --> 00:45:02.935
Big Brother!

307
00:45:02.936 --> 00:45:05.396
Kamehame
-Ha!!

308
00:45:08.108 --> 00:45:09.108
Goten!

309
00:45:28.629 --> 00:45:31.255
Gohan-san...Goten...

310
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.975
Our power is not enough!
We need more power!


311
00:45:42.976 --> 00:45:45.269
Shen Long, please, help!

312
00:45:54.613 --> 00:45:57.990
What are you doing,
giving up over just that!?


313
00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:59.992
Dad!

314
00:45:59.993 --> 00:46:01.118
Father!

315
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:05.164
You have to use up every
last bit of power you hold!


316
00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:07.250
There ain't anything else!

317
00:46:18.011 --> 00:46:19.303
Shen Long has brought Father here!

318
00:46:25.018 --> 00:46:27.103
Kakarrot!

319
00:46:27.104 --> 00:46:33.192
Kame...hame...Ha!!

320
00:46:42.077 --> 00:46:45.288
Gohan, you ain't giving enough power!

321
00:46:47.082 --> 00:46:49.458
Goten, don't be scared!

322
00:46:51.628 --> 00:46:56.048
ls it fine with you guys if the Earth
is smashed to pieces by Broli!?


323
00:46:56.049 --> 00:46:58.259
Can't you protect it if l ain't around!?

324
00:47:15.068 --> 00:47:20.364
Damn. To think there's a guy out
there that our powers can't reach...


325
00:47:29.583 --> 00:47:32.877
lf l'm dreaming, wake me up!

326
00:47:54.107 --> 00:47:55.483
Now!

327
00:48:03.575 --> 00:48:04.283
Kakarrot!

328
00:48:20.092 --> 00:48:22.176
Kakarrot-o!!

329
00:48:57.087 --> 00:48:58.170
Dad!

330
00:49:11.184 --> 00:49:14.645
Dad, you did come here, didn't you?

331
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:24.071
Gohan-kun, what happened
to that monster!?


332
00:49:26.074 --> 00:49:29.076
So that's it!
Gohan-kun, you did it!


333
00:49:29.077 --> 00:49:31.203
No, it wasn't me!

334
00:49:31.204 --> 00:49:34.081
You're still hiding things from me!

335
00:49:34.082 --> 00:49:35.207
No, l...

336
00:49:35.208 --> 00:49:38.252
You're not getting away with it
this time! Tell me everything!


337
00:49:41.214 --> 00:49:43.174
Hold it!

338
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:47.219
Hold it, l said!

339
00:49:48.555 --> 00:49:49.555
Now, hang on!

340
00:49:49.556 --> 00:49:51.390
Gohan-kun!

341
00:49:53.226 --> 00:49:55.102
Big Brother...

342
00:49:55.103 --> 00:49:58.564
Leave them alone. Those two are having
a pretty good time of it like that!


343
00:49:58.565 --> 00:50:02.568
Aw, l'm hungry! l think l'll go back
to the village and have them feed me!


344
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:06.489
Wait for me, Trunks-kun!
I'll go too!


345
00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:14.497
What exactly was that image of Goku?
Was it a miracle of the Dragon Balls?


346
00:50:14.498 --> 00:50:18.084
Or was it just a momentary apparition?

347
00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:20.252
That is something nobody can tell.

348
00:50:22.089 --> 00:50:25.591
Hey, there! That's all fine
and everything,


349
00:50:25.592 --> 00:50:28.260
but what happens to me?

350
00:50:35.393 --> 00:50:39.605
Big Fight!

351
00:50:48.031 --> 00:50:54.370
A burning flame cuts its way
through sky and space!


352
00:50:54.371 --> 00:51:00.084
Combining the past and the future,
the mixed-up battle continues!


353
00:51:00.085 --> 00:51:06.423
Hey girl, your endless
dreams are our power,


354
00:51:06.424 --> 00:51:13.097
Hey boy, if you would lend us
a bit of your courage,


355
00:51:13.098 --> 00:51:21.564
I'll show you an uncommonly cool,
exceptionally stunning miracle technique!


356
00:51:23.775 --> 00:51:27.444
An awesome Big Fight
scorches all the land,


357
00:51:27.445 --> 00:51:31.115
Big Fight with iron
fists spitting flame!


358
00:51:31.116 --> 00:51:35.786
Two lives will not be enough!

359
00:51:36.454 --> 00:51:40.166
That's right, Big Fight,
my body is a missile,


360
00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:43.836
Big Fight, my heart is a jewel!

361
00:51:43.837 --> 00:51:49.884
Beaming with limitless love
are the Dragon Balls!


362
00:51:49.885 --> 00:51:59.885
Big Fight!
