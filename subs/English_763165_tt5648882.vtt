1
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.448
Uh-huh. Yes, Lord.

2
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:30.448
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.198
I'm Willie Gary.

4
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.674
All right, now, you know
my brother's Albert, he preaches here,


5
00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:37.781
but he asked me to come down and-and,
uh, share a bit with y'all.


6
00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.531
But I say like this,
when God calls...


7
00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.990
...you have to answer.

8
00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:43.341
- That's right. - Mm-hmm.
- And that's what it is.


9
00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:45.781
God was on my heart
and on my spirit today,

10
00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:47.615
so that's why I came
here to speak to you.

11
00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:50.156
I say to myself, what sustains us?

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.573
What gives us a feeling of,
of a spirit that, where we,


13
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:55.115
we feel safe?

14
00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.156
I believe it's home.

15
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.365
If I could just get home.

16
00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:07.573
Even saying the word "home"
makes you feel a kind of way.


17
00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:09.948
- Where do I need to get?
- Home.


18
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.656
- Where do we want to be?
- Home.


19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.948
- Home is where the heart is. Amen.
- Amen.


20
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.281
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.


21
00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:19.365
'Cause when you home, your family's there,

22
00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:21.156
everybody's there, you home.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.698
And where's home for us?

24
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:23.781
Black church.

25
00:01:23.865 --> 00:01:25.615
Huh?

26
00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:26.906
Black church.

27
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.406
I don't hear you. Where are we?

28
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.531
Black church!

29
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.823
Speak to it.

30
00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:34.226
In Black church, they don't say
that I fit the description.


31
00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:39.115
In Black church, they don't judge me
because of the color of my skin.


32
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.531
In Black church,
they don't call me out my name.


33
00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:45.865
And if they do
call me out my name,

34
00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:47.073
you know what they call me?

35
00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.382
- What do they call you?
- I said, do you know what they call me?


36
00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:52.865
- What do they call you?
- They call me a child of God.


37
00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:54.990
You are one. Yes, sir!

38
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.281
- All right.
- Thank you.


39
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:01.716
All right, now, doc.
Good to see you.


40
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.448
Now, y'all take care, okay?

41
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:04.841
- All right, now. All right.
- Have a good week.


42
00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.025
- All right, doc.
- All right.


43
00:02:06.073 --> 00:02:07.281
All right, you take care.

44
00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.424
- That was a wonderful message, you hear me?
- Right.

I made it just for you.

51
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.031
Well, aren't I lucky?

52
00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.323
Let's have a look here.

53
00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:33.865
13 children, 24 grandchildren.

54
00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:36.365
I'd say you done good, Mr. O'Keefe.

55
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:39.573
And you have done well...

56
00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:41.906
Mrs. O'Keefe.

57
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.990
Very well indeed.

58
00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:49.031
Not one felon in the whole damn bunch.

59
00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:55.990
Are you... Hey.

60
00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.740
- Hmm?
- Hey, are you okay?


61
00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:00.156
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.


62
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.740
I'm just checking in on you.

63
00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:04.156
I'm still allowed to do that.

64
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.216
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
- That's good. Good to hear.


65
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.406
I could not be happier with this day.

66
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:20.490
The well-being
of this man's life depends on y'all.


67
00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:27.240
Can I just talk simple to y'all?

68
00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.781
Hmm? Plain, ordinary talk?

69
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:33.906
'Cause I think they trying
to talk over y'all head.


70
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.031
And we not gonna allow that.

71
00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.156
Now, I got some secrets about my client.

72
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240
And I'm gonna tell you right now,

73
00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:43.531
my client ain't no good.

74
00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.073
He ain't.

75
00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:49.781
My no-good client, Clovis Tubbs,
on the day of the accident,


76
00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:51.281
was drunk.

77
00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:55.448
That's right. Drunk.

78
00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:57.156
Uh... tanked.

79
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.906
Wasted. Toe up from the flo' up.

80
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.448
Matter of fact,
you want to check the numbers?


81
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.281
The numbers say, uh,

82
00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:06.865
It's right here.

83
00:04:06.948 --> 00:04:09.823
Inebriated, if you want
to say a big word.

84
00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:12.865
Not only that,

85
00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:14.365
he was going through mental things.

86
00:04:14.448 --> 00:04:16.656
He said he was suffering from depression.

87
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.740
Some would say that he was suicidal,
and we have the proof of that,


88
00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:21.948
because when he was talking
to his therapist,


89
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.323
he'd told his therapist, "I'm feeling
so bad I wish I could get in my car


90
00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:27.115
and ride straight into a tree."

91
00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:29.990
But he couldn't do that.

92
00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.156
My no-good client couldn't do that.
You know why?


93
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.865
His license is revoked.

94
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.656
Ain't even got a license.

95
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.156
So what'd he say?
"I'm gonna get me a bicycle


96
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.865
and I'm gonna do it that way."

97
00:04:43.948 --> 00:04:46.115
And that's exactly what he did.

98
00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.091
He got on his bicycle and rode over there
to Alberta and Vine.


99
00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:49.906
Y'all know the liquor store
over there, huh?


100
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.466
And he got him a big old bottle of Scotch
and he downed it, and what'd he do?


101
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.031
Get on that bicycle and he rode straight
towards the highway, towards traffic.


102
00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.531
Hmm?

103
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:01.948
And then, here comes Mr. Eighteen
-Wheeler,

104
00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:04.865
Finch and Company,
not paying no attention.


105
00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:07.906
To nothing. Coming down Elm.

106
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.490
And what did he do? Bam!

107
00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:12.490
He hit Clovis.

108
00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.698
He hit him.

109
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.365
He should be dead.

110
00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:19.406
He should be dead.

111
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.781
Y'all know that song, um...

112
00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:22.865
♪ I'm looking for a miracle ♪?

113
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.781
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm?


114
00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:26.365
That's a miracle, right here.

115
00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:31.823
That's why we asking for you
to look in your hearts and your soul


116
00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:34.615
and award him that mere $75 million.

117
00:05:34.698 --> 00:05:36.281
You know why? They got it.

118
00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:38.281
They got it.

119
00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:39.740
They got the bank to do it.

120
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.115
But they know they big,
trying to step on the small man.


121
00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.656
And then you say,
"Well, why $75 million, Willie Gary?"


122
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.906
I'm-a tell you why.

123
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.656
Because we have the evidence.

124
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.406
The evidence will prove
that there was negligence.


125
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.698
Because no-good Clovis

126
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:58.031
had one thing going good for him,

127
00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:59.448
at that time.

128
00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:01.281
Even though he was drunk,

129
00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:03.198
tanked, toe up from the flo' up,

130
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:05.865
depressed and suicidal,

131
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.240
my no-good client, 
Clovis Tubbs...

132
00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:13.656
...had him a green light.

133
00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:16.031
Yes, he did.

134
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.799

I'm Willie Gary. 
Y'all come on in.

144
00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:51.135
Listen, I apologize for keeping y'all
waiting out there so long.


145
00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:53.448
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gary.
I'm Jeremiah O'Keefe.


146
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:55.073
"Jeremiah." I like that.

147
00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:57.341
That's biblical. Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations. That's biblical.


148
00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:58.740
- Now, who's this?
- Hey...


149
00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:00.591
He's my junior counsel, 
Halbert Dockins.

150
00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:02.156
Well, H
-Hal's fine.

151
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.882
- Uh, it's an honor, Mr. Gary.
- You're too young


152
00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:05.198
to be a lawyer, Negro.

153
00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:06.591
I thought you was his foster child.

154
00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:07.924
Really? Come on,
no, I'm just kidding with you.


155
00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:08.948
Come on in here.

156
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:12.823
This is, this is my, uh,
partner, Reggie Douglas.


157
00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:14.240
He runs my point.

158
00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:17.031
So, what y'all got?
What y'all got for Willie Gary?


159
00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:18.615
Hmm? P.I.?

160
00:07:18.698 --> 00:07:20.115
I beg your pardon?

161
00:07:20.198 --> 00:07:22.490
P.I. Personal injury.
Y'all got some personal injuries?


162
00:07:22.573 --> 00:07:24.031
Didn't y'all see the sign outside?

163
00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:25.549
That's the only kind of law
we practice round here.


164
00:07:25.573 --> 00:07:26.823
Uh, well, yes and no.

165
00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:29.365
Um, I guess...
I guess we sort of have a...


166
00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:32.115
a P.I. case, but with
a bit of a twist.

167
00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:34.156
Bit of a twist?
Okay, what-what kind of twist?


168
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.531
What kind of case is it?

169
00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:37.573
It's a contract law case.

170
00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:39.656
Contract law? Oh, come on, man.

171
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.031
- We don't do no contract law here.
- Hell, nah.


172
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:43.715
That sound like a nap waiting to happen.

173
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.466
- Yeah. Yeah, we don't do no contract law.
- I mean, hell.


174
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.948
R-Right, but look, we understand
it's not necessarily your field,


175
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:50.591
but perhaps you could just hear him out.

176
00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:52.448
I think you'll find the case compelling.

177
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.656
I am a, um, funeral director

178
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.323
from Biloxi, Mississippi.

179
00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.698
I have a business there... Well, actually,
I have several businesses there.


180
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:08.115
I have eight funeral homes
and one burial insurance company.


181
00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:10.990
<i>We are a family business,</i>

182
00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:12.698
<i>and have been for over a hundred years.</i>

183
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.990
<i>And we are not about to lose that
without a fight.</i>


184
00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:18.031
<i>After I returned from the war,</i>

185
00:08:18.115 --> 00:08:20.823
<i>my father passed the business to me,</i>

186
00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:23.198
<i>which I considered a sacred trust.</i>

187
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:26.240
<i>Annette and I were blessed
with 13 children,</i>


188
00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:29.281
<i>and we intend for them</i>

189
00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.198
<i>to carry the business into the future.</i>

190
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:33.073
<i>But about a year ago,</i>

191
00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.823
<i>I ran into some financial trouble.</i>

192
00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:37.740
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How can I help you?


193
00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:40.448
We're here on behalf
of the state insurance commission.


194
00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:43.323
Mr. O'Keefe, as a registered
burial insurance broker


195
00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:44.698
in the state of Mississippi,

196
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.490
I'm sure you're aware
you're required to maintain


197
00:08:47.573 --> 00:08:50.240
a certain minimum funds
in your account at all times.


198
00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:52.115
Well, yes. Of course I'm aware.

199
00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:04.490
Insurance regulators?

200
00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:06.781
You gotta be kidding me.

201
00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:09.198
What'd they say they want, exactly?

202
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.740
Truth is, I may have gotten myself
into a lot of trouble.


203
00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:13.615
Trouble?

204
00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:16.490
Jerry...

205
00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:20.198
I've been your lawyer, what,
coming up on 30 years?


206
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.490
Was your friend even before that.

207
00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:24.448
You and I both know

208
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:27.156
I've been in debt
up to my neck for years,


209
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.698
trying to make this business strong,

210
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.281
make it last,

211
00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:33.781
so I have something to leave my children.

212
00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:38.073
Let's not panic just yet.

213
00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.573
I get how stressful this is,

214
00:09:40.656 --> 00:09:42.948
but I'm pretty sure we can
find a way out of it.


215
00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:44.281
Hold up a second.

216
00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:45.531
Excuse me, son.

217
00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:47.049
- Do you want another drink?
- No, no.


218
00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:49.740
Whenever you get a chance,
could I get another bourbon over here?


219
00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:51.323
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.


220
00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:57.365
So, look,

221
00:09:57.448 --> 00:10:00.156
have you considered
selling off part of the business?


222
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.490
No.

223
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.281
Just part of it. Okay?

224
00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.833
Well, I'm not saying I want to,
but if I did,


225
00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:10.573
where would I find a buyer?

226
00:10:10.656 --> 00:10:13.365
Canada, actually.

227
00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:15.448
They made an inquiry.

228
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.198
Loewen Group? Oh, yeah.

229
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:20.031
They've been on a pretty significant
acquisition spree.


230
00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:22.406
Going all across the country,

231
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.323
buying up every independently owned
funeral chain they can get their hands on.


232
00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:30.031
These guys, they're really big players.

233
00:10:30.115 --> 00:10:32.573
Now, you know how I feel
about these big corporations, now.


234
00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:36.156
Yes, I do. But all I'm saying is
it's an option.


235
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.990
And it's out there.

236
00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:41.781
Might be a way out.

237
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.031
You could think about it.

238
00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:52.740
Jerry.

239
00:10:52.823 --> 00:10:54.406
Perfect timing.

240
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.115
- Hey, you need a hand with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.


241
00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.615
Hey, so, listen.

242
00:10:58.698 --> 00:11:00.073
You're sure about this, right?

243
00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:01.990
No, I've given this a lot of thought,

244
00:11:02.073 --> 00:11:03.966
and I believe this is
the right thing to do for my family.


245
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.156
All righty, then.

246
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.882
Next stop, Vancouver.
You ready to go inside?


247
00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:08.406
No, we got to wait for Hal.

248
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.323
- Who?
- I told you about Hal.


249
00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:11.757
He's a friend of my son's from college,

250
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:13.198
very bright young man

251
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:15.448
just getting started out
as a lawyer and, uh...


252
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:17.031
Well, hell, here he comes now.

253
00:11:17.115 --> 00:11:19.448
Recently passed the bar exam.

254
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.531
Hungry for experience.

255
00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.281
Who, which one?

256
00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:25.948
That tall kid?

257
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.156
Hey, hey, sorry.
So sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. Um...


258
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.382
My taxi just dropped me off
at the wrong terminal, so...


259
00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:34.615
Oh, don't worry about it. Halbert Dockins,
I want you to meet Mike Allred.


260
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.656
Really great to meet you, Mr. Allred.

261
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.341
I'm very excited
to be a member of the team.


262
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.865
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.


263
00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:43.531
So you're a lawyer?

264
00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.531
Uh, yeah.

265
00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:48.448
Well, that's just great.
Good for you, son.


266
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:50.365
I'll see you guys inside.

267
00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.573
Come on. We're going to Canada.

268
00:11:58.656 --> 00:12:00.156
<i>I work for Ray Loewen.</i>

269
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.920
<i>He's really looking forward
to meeting you.</i>


270
00:12:01.948 --> 00:12:03.490
As I'm sure you can gather,

271
00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:05.365
Ray's a very hands-on kind of guy.

272
00:12:05.448 --> 00:12:08.365
One of the only CEOs in the industry

273
00:12:08.448 --> 00:12:10.323
who likes to meet with
every seller personally.


274
00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:12.781
Hey, Ray!

275
00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.781
Allow me to introduce Mr. Jeremiah O'Keefe

276
00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:18.448
- and his colleagues.
- It is a pleasure to meet you, Jerry.


277
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:23.031
So, boys, how do you like the way we do
business up here in Canada?


278
00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.448
Come on on board. 
Get you a drink.

279
00:12:27.531 --> 00:12:31.031
At present, we own 1,115 funeral homes,

280
00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:32.573
427 cemeteries,

281
00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:36.156
354 insurance companies.

282
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.781
My strategy is simple.

283
00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:41.031
Buy as many funeral homes as I can

284
00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:43.406
and put myself in a position

285
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.240
for what I like to call

286
00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:48.948
the Golden Era of Death.

287
00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:51.948
Sorry?

288
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:54.115
It's when all the baby boomers
across the U.S.


289
00:12:54.198 --> 00:12:56.406
finally reach their age of demise.

290
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.906
Resulting in a minimum 60% increase

291
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.448
in death rates nationwide.

292
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:06.573
Do you have any idea how many people
are living in the U.S.,


293
00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:08.823
right now,

294
00:13:08.906 --> 00:13:10.781
over the age of 65?

295
00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:15.156
51 million.

296
00:13:17.615 --> 00:13:18.924
That sounds kind of cynical to me.

297
00:13:18.948 --> 00:13:21.115
Aren't you worried
about losing sight of your customer?


298
00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:22.198
My customer?

299
00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:24.281
What customer?
My customers are dead guys.


300
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.156
I'm just kidding.

301
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.365
I'm just kidding, Jerry.

302
00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:36.906
Look, the more funeral homes I own,

303
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.490
the more money I make,

304
00:13:38.573 --> 00:13:41.656
the more I am able to meet the demands
of my customer.


305
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.365
And provide for his... growing needs.

306
00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:51.323
Maybe it's time that we drop
all this chit-chat


307
00:13:51.406 --> 00:13:53.257
and start talking about a deal.
What do you say, gentlemen?


308
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:56.073
I'm interested to hear
what you have in mind, Ray.


309
00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:58.073
My understanding

310
00:13:58.156 --> 00:13:59.740
is that you're having a bit of trouble

311
00:13:59.823 --> 00:14:01.573
with the state regulators down there.

312
00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:04.031
How'd you come to that understanding?

313
00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:06.281
You own... what?

314
00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:07.740
Nine homes across the state?

315
00:14:07.823 --> 00:14:08.865
Eight.

316
00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.531
I own eight funeral homes
across the state.


317
00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:14.781
And my insurance business, of course.

318
00:14:14.865 --> 00:14:16.990
So what about this?

319
00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:19.823
You sell me three of your homes,

320
00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:22.240
at a fair market value
to be agreed upon later.


321
00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:25.698
Then, not only do you get to keep

322
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.865
the bulk of your assets,

323
00:14:27.948 --> 00:14:30.406
but it would also provide you
with more than enough fresh cash


324
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.406
to deal with the regulators.

325
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.781
Now, there's something else
I want out of this deal.


326
00:14:36.198 --> 00:14:39.031
I make most of my profits
from selling burial insurance.


327
00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:42.115
There's no way I can survive
if you have a monopoly


328
00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:44.115
on that, too, so what I propose

329
00:14:44.198 --> 00:14:46.198
is that I sell you
three of my funeral homes,


330
00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:47.948
fair market value...

331
00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:51.132
...but you're going to have to promise,
here and now,


332
00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:54.823
to no longer sell burial insurance
in southern Mississippi.


333
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:09.365
Okay.

334
00:15:12.073 --> 00:15:14.365
So does this mean we have a deal?

335
00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:16.698
I'll get my lawyers
to draw up the contracts


336
00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:18.573
so we can get it done immediately.

337
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:26.073
What the hell is taking so long?

338
00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:27.406
We closed on this deal, um...

339
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.823
Coming up on four months now.

340
00:15:28.906 --> 00:15:30.865
They keep trying to re-trade the terms.

341
00:15:30.948 --> 00:15:34.531
When we left Vancouver,
they said it would take 30 days max.


342
00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:37.299
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I don't know, makes perfect sense to me.


343
00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:38.365
Why?

344
00:15:39.823 --> 00:15:41.365
Have you considered the possibility

345
00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:44.656
that Loewen has no intention
of closing this deal at all?


346
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.948
Son, with all due respect,
you don't have the faintest idea


347
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.281
what you're talking about.

348
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.490
I think I do.

349
00:15:50.573 --> 00:15:52.323
Think about it.

350
00:15:52.406 --> 00:15:54.865
The longer he stalls,
the worse you're screwed.


351
00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:57.073
First, the insurance commission
takes your license,


352
00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:58.716
effectively destroying your livelihood,

353
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:02.031
until, sooner or later, you have no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.


354
00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:04.573
Now not only does Loewen get
the three homes,


355
00:16:04.656 --> 00:16:06.841
he can actually buy your entire business
out from under you


356
00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.198
at yard-sale prices.

357
00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:10.031
You really think
he's trying to bankrupt me?


358
00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:12.365
Hell, he can't do that;
I got a signed contract.


359
00:16:12.448 --> 00:16:15.073
It was only signed on our end.

360
00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:16.781
With no closing date attached.

361
00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:18.265
And, by the way, I heard Mr. Loewen

362
00:16:18.323 --> 00:16:19.882
is actually still selling insurance
in the region.


363
00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:21.906
Oh, come on.
Stop with the conspiracy theories.


364
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.073
Son, I'm sorry,
but you really are paranoid.


365
00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:26.156
Okay.

366
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240
Um...

367
00:16:27.323 --> 00:16:29.073
would you mind doing me a favor?

368
00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.865
Would you mind stop calling me son?

369
00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:35.531
I am not your son, Mike.

370
00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:36.698
Whoa.

371
00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:38.573
Just take it easy, okay?

372
00:16:38.656 --> 00:16:40.490
You really want to be taken seriously

373
00:16:40.573 --> 00:16:42.466
- as a lawyer in this town?
- Okay. Who says I'm not?


374
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.365
Enough of that, y'all.

375
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.531
Do you really think Mr. Loewen has the
intention of running me into the ground?


376
00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:52.990
I do.

377
00:16:53.073 --> 00:16:55.781
Why the hell should he be
on our clock anyway?


378
00:16:55.865 --> 00:16:58.406
Well, that's it. 
I'm gonna sue him.

379
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.531
You've never sued anybody before
in your whole life.


380
00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:03.656
Well, I'm liable to,
just about any minute now.


381
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.948
Yeah. Well, you think 75 years of age
is a good time to start suing people?


382
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:10.740
Old men don't file lawsuits.

383
00:17:10.823 --> 00:17:13.740
The way I see it, if somebody tries
to take advantage of you,


384
00:17:13.823 --> 00:17:16.573
and you know it's wrong,
it don't matter how old you are.


385
00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:18.531
This fellow tried to bully me
out of business.


386
00:17:18.615 --> 00:17:21.115
And I don't think
I should be expected to stand for it.


387
00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.740
I'm here to file a lawsuit.

388
00:17:32.823 --> 00:17:34.406
That the complaint right there?

389
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.573
May I see it, please?

390
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:43.365
<i>"Jeremiah J. O'Keefe Sr.
v. The Loewen Group LLC."</i>


391
00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:45.073
Ooh.

392
00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:46.573
Sounds juicy.

393
00:17:46.656 --> 00:17:48.490
Who do you think's gonna win?

394
00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:50.115
Excuse me?

395
00:17:52.156 --> 00:17:53.948
Well, goodness, Hal,

396
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.156
what are you doing here?

397
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.781
- You know what time it is?
- Look, uh,


398
00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:58.257
I know it's late.
I'm really sorry about that.


399
00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:01.323
I-I found something I think will be
really useful for our case.


400
00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:07.656
The thrills continue with another

401
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.573
opulent episode on
<i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</i>


402
00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:13.656
<i>You won't believe
the amazing journey of famed</i>


403
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.781
<i>personal injury lawyer Willie E. Gary,</i>

404
00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:20.365
<i>a man who refused to accept
a life sentence of poverty</i>


405
00:18:20.448 --> 00:18:23.240
<i>because he believed in the American dream.</i>

406
00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:25.531
<i>Born to a family of migrant sharecroppers</i>

407
00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:28.115
<i>working the sugarcane fields of Florida,</i>

408
00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:31.615
<i>life wasn't always a bed of roses
for Willie Gary.</i>


409
00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:34.615
I just always had this burning desire
to be something, you know?


410
00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.716
And I-I knew I was going
to make something of myself.


411
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.341
<i>And make something of himself he did,</i>

412
00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:41.698
<i>as now Willie regularly wins
multimillion-dollar cases...</i>


413
00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:45.156
Are you suggesting I hire this guy
as one of my lawyers?


414
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.823
Seems like a crazy idea,

415
00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:49.906
but this guy wins cases. I mean...

416
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.948
<i>He not only owns
his own private 737 jet,</i>


417
00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:53.656
<i>called</i> Wings of Justice,

418
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.115
<i>he also lives the high life
in a 50-room mansion</i>


419
00:18:57.198 --> 00:19:00.281
<i>along the luxurious Florida coast.</i>

420
00:19:00.365 --> 00:19:03.281
<i>But Willie can't take credit
for the decorating,</i>


421
00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:06.531
<i>as that job belongs
to Willie's childhood sweetheart,</i>


422
00:19:06.615 --> 00:19:09.448
<i>his gorgeous and alluring wife Gloria.</i>

423
00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:10.531
<i>One thing</i>

424
00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:13.281
that I always try
to remind Willie of is to...


425
00:19:13.365 --> 00:19:15.365
- is to never forget where he came from.
- Mm.


426
00:19:15.448 --> 00:19:17.156
- Stay humble.
<i>- Yes,</i>


427
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.990
<i>"humble" is Willie Gary's middle name.</i>

428
00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:21.865
Don't never let nobody tell you
you can't do something, okay?


429
00:19:21.948 --> 00:19:23.573
Willie Gary told you that.

430
00:19:23.656 --> 00:19:25.031
Give me a pound.

431
00:19:25.115 --> 00:19:26.656
<i>Never forgetting his roots...</i>

432
00:19:28.823 --> 00:19:31.341
Believe it or not, he's got
an absolutely flawless trial record.


433
00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:34.323
He supposedly hasn't lost a case
in over 12 years.


434
00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:35.882
What does he know about contract law?

435
00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:37.490
This is a contract law case.

436
00:19:37.573 --> 00:19:39.573
The case was filed down in Hinds County.

437
00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:42.406
That's a three-to-one Black/white ratio.

438
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.031
That means there's a 70% chance
we'll get a Black judge,


439
00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:46.781
and if we do go to trial,

440
00:19:46.865 --> 00:19:48.698
likely a Black jury as well.

441
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:51.115
- So what?
- With all due respect,


442
00:19:51.198 --> 00:19:54.781
you-you can't put a guy like Mike Allred
in front of a Black jury.


443
00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:56.865
Why the hell not?

444
00:19:56.948 --> 00:19:58.573
He has been my attorney for 30 years.

445
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.031
He knows contract law better than anybody.

446
00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:02.823
You're really gonna
make me spell this out.


447
00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:04.073
Um...

448
00:20:06.698 --> 00:20:11.781
He literally reeks self-satisfied,
good ol' boy Southern bigotry.


449
00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:16.573
I mean, a Black jury sees
a guy like that coming...


450
00:20:16.656 --> 00:20:20.198
The idea of us pandering to a jury
like that, Hal, it's not...


451
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.990
It...

452
00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:25.073
This is not a discrimination suit.

453
00:20:25.156 --> 00:20:29.115
You and I both know
that race has nothing to do with this.


454
00:20:33.448 --> 00:20:36.198
I happen to know, for a fact,
that Mr. Gary is trying a case


455
00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:37.948
down in Florida this week.

456
00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.865
What if... what if...

457
00:20:41.948 --> 00:20:43.865
you and I went down there,
just for the day,


458
00:20:43.948 --> 00:20:45.740
and try to meet him in person?

459
00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:49.365
Essentially, we just want
to hold the Loewen Group


460
00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:50.990
responsible for their actions.

461
00:20:51.073 --> 00:20:52.466
Nah, nah, nah. 
That ain't what you want.

462
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.091
What you want to do
is you want to make 'em pay.


463
00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:55.591
- Make 'em hurt, make 'em pay.
- Yeah, yeah.


464
00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:57.448
So, how much money y'all trying
to get, hmm?


465
00:20:57.531 --> 00:20:59.865
- Uh, $6 million.
- $6 million.


466
00:20:59.948 --> 00:21:03.531
That's full, fair market value
plus damages,


467
00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:08.698
and I've already filed a civil claim
in Hinds County, Mississippi.


468
00:21:08.781 --> 00:21:10.531
Well?

469
00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:13.281
What-what do you think, Mr. Gary?
Do you like the case?


470
00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:17.031
I'm gonna give you my personal opinion.

471
00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:18.615
Honest.

472
00:21:18.698 --> 00:21:22.781
Look, Mr. O'Keefe, I'm sorry for
what this Loewen guy did to you...


473
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.406
he sounds like he's a big asshole
and everything like that...


474
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.365
but, um, this ain't no Willie Gary case.

475
00:21:28.448 --> 00:21:30.156
It just ain't. It ain't...

476
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.490
It ain't a Willie Gary case.

477
00:21:31.573 --> 00:21:33.216
Uh, wait, what-what do you mean?
Why-why not?


478
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.156
It ain't a Willie Gary case

479
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.281
- 'cause it ain't for Willie Gary.
- No, but...


480
00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:39.490
I'm sorry,
what is a "Willie Gary case," then?


481
00:21:39.573 --> 00:21:40.966
- I don't...
- In other words, what he's saying is


482
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.740
a Willie Gary case is the type of case
where I have the upper hand.


483
00:21:43.823 --> 00:21:47.240
Where I feel that I can take
this case to trial. Understand?


484
00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:49.424
- All the way.
- And-and once I get 'em in that trial,


485
00:21:49.448 --> 00:21:50.656
I mean, y'all seen my tape.

486
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.466
When I get 'em in front of...
especially in front of people


487
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.591
that-that look like me...
I'm-a play 'em like a symphony.


488
00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:55.990
Mm. Mozart.

489
00:21:56.073 --> 00:21:59.031
A Willie Gary case is
where I could take that judgement


490
00:21:59.115 --> 00:22:02.115
and push it all the way up,
to the heavens if I need to,


491
00:22:02.198 --> 00:22:04.490
and get as much money as I can
for my client.


492
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:06.740
Uh, what he's saying is,
a Willie Gary case


493
00:22:06.823 --> 00:22:08.073
is a case we know we can win.

494
00:22:08.156 --> 00:22:09.740
This case... not so much.

495
00:22:09.823 --> 00:22:12.448
Matter of fact,
your case a little bit iffy.


496
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.240
And, uh...

497
00:22:16.323 --> 00:22:17.865
the other thing is this.

498
00:22:17.948 --> 00:22:20.031
Don't take this the wrong way, but, uh...

499
00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:24.531
He, uh, he's... you're white... he's white.

500
00:22:24.615 --> 00:22:27.865
And I don't have white clients.

501
00:22:27.948 --> 00:22:30.698
I've never had any, so...

502
00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:35.531
No offense or anything like that,
but this is just unusual for me.


503
00:22:36.698 --> 00:22:39.573
No offense taken, Mr. Gary.

504
00:22:40.698 --> 00:22:43.031
That guy's too rich and famous
for us, Halbert.


505
00:22:43.115 --> 00:22:44.615
Uh-huh.

506
00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:47.031
Um, you know what, Mr. O'Keefe?
Just, um...


507
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.424
- What?
- You know, just-just give me one second.


508
00:22:48.448 --> 00:22:49.632
- All right?
- Where you going?


509
00:22:49.656 --> 00:22:50.966
I'm
-I'm gonna talk with him one more time.

510
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.323
G
-Give me five minutes, okay?

511
00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:54.115
The green light scenario,

512
00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:57.031
when I was talking to the,
the one juror, uh, uh...


513
00:22:57.115 --> 00:22:58.490
What'd she have on?

514
00:22:58.573 --> 00:23:00.493
I'd have maybe looked at her
a little bit longer.


515
00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:01.841
You know, gave her some eye contact.

516
00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:03.632
- Sometimes you got to romance them.
- Listen, I'm not...


517
00:23:03.656 --> 00:23:05.466
- That's the thing, I don't know that...
- Look, Mr. Gary,


518
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.466
I'm so sorry to come back in here
like this, I really am,


519
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.299
- but I just need a minute of your time.
- What's going on with you, man?


520
00:23:09.323 --> 00:23:10.963
- You lost? Huh?
- Yeah. Lost your mind...


521
00:23:11.031 --> 00:23:12.882
Or did he fire your ass
out there by the elevator?


522
00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:15.573
Okay, yeah, maybe so,
but listen, I... I...


523
00:23:15.656 --> 00:23:17.757
- I just need a minute of your time.
- You need a minute?


524
00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:19.757
- One minute. That's all I ask.
- Well, you know what, that's all you got.


525
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:21.174
'Cause we busy. Then, come on, Hal.

526
00:23:21.198 --> 00:23:23.990
I mean, Jerry's a... a dream client.

527
00:23:24.073 --> 00:23:25.781
He's got a great narrative.

528
00:23:25.865 --> 00:23:27.073
He's a war hero.

529
00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:28.615
A decorated war hero.

530
00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:30.323
He served in World War II.

531
00:23:30.406 --> 00:23:32.382
- He was, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross...
- Yeah.


532
00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:34.365
- ...for service for his country.
- Hmm.


533
00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:36.448
- Is that all you got?
- Man.


534
00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:37.615
That's it?

535
00:23:37.698 --> 00:23:40.948
- Wasn't World War II about 50 years ago?
- Yeah, man.


536
00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:43.382
- Hal, don't nobody give a shit except them.
- That's old news, nigga.


537
00:23:43.406 --> 00:23:44.799
All right. All right. 
How about this?

538
00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.073
Okay, um...

539
00:23:46.156 --> 00:23:48.323
In 1976,

540
00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:52.948
Jerry was serving as a two-term mayor
in his hometown of Biloxi.


541
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.948
The KKK tried to organize a march...

542
00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:57.781
And he stopped 'em
from buying white sheets.


543
00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:02.448
- Shit, man.
- I guess, I guess he's supposed to be


544
00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:04.757
- our white savior now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. KKK, man.


545
00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:06.299
You sound like you
in love with him, man.

546
00:24:07.573 --> 00:24:10.990
No, that's not my point. I'm saying we're
hopefully trying the case in Hinds County.


547
00:24:11.073 --> 00:24:13.257
- There's a three-to-one...
- Hold-hold on. Let me stop you, Hal.


548
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.615
Now, listen, Hal, I like you...
I-I think you come from good stock...


549
00:24:16.698 --> 00:24:18.257
but you got to understand
how we work here.


550
00:24:18.281 --> 00:24:21.240
One, we don't do contract law.

551
00:24:21.323 --> 00:24:24.198
- Two, we don't have no white clients.
- No.


552
00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:26.990
And three, that ain't enough money.

553
00:24:27.073 --> 00:24:28.823
My, not enough money.

554
00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:31.174
It ain't enough money, Hal.
You know, I-I-I love you, man,


555
00:24:31.198 --> 00:24:32.823
but it ain't enough money for us.

556
00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.781
Brother, look around.
You see where you are?


557
00:24:34.865 --> 00:24:37.031
You don't see this mahogany wood?

558
00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:38.531
- Gold finish?
- Got to see it.


559
00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:40.007
- Preach. Yeah.
- It's the big time, baby.


560
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:42.156
We doing cases for $50 million,
$30 million,


561
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.781
- $80 million cases monthly.
- Yeah.


562
00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:45.198
Okay. Okay.

563
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:48.073
But how do you know this case
can't be something bigger?


564
00:24:49.115 --> 00:24:50.406
Well...

565
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.740
we don't know.

566
00:24:52.823 --> 00:24:54.615
You know something we don't?

567
00:24:56.115 --> 00:24:58.656
Ray Loewen happens to sit at the top

568
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.823
of one of the biggest industries
in this country.


569
00:25:01.906 --> 00:25:02.990
Hmm.

570
00:25:03.073 --> 00:25:06.448
I'm talking about the $20 billion a year
death care industry.


571
00:25:07.531 --> 00:25:10.323
There are two huge corporations moving in
and taking over everything,


572
00:25:10.406 --> 00:25:12.281
and the Loewen Group is one of them.

573
00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:16.656
Now, what they did to Jerry
is truly terrible, but...


574
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.781
I have a feeling it's just... it's-it...

575
00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:22.115
No. I know. It's
the tip of the iceberg.

576
00:25:23.615 --> 00:25:25.406
- Hmm.
- Can I keep going?


577
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.740
Sure. Shit.

578
00:25:26.823 --> 00:25:28.781
Well, that's where you should've started.

579
00:25:28.865 --> 00:25:31.531
You guys try all these
$80 million cases, and...


580
00:25:31.615 --> 00:25:33.716
and you have your private jet and
all that, I get it, that's fine, but...


581
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.990
Yeah, I do. <i>Wings of Justice.</i>

582
00:25:35.073 --> 00:25:37.573
Great. Look, you know
as well as I do

583
00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:40.365
that as far as the more elite
legal community in this country goes,


584
00:25:40.448 --> 00:25:42.698
you're nothing more than
a glorified ambulance chaser.


585
00:25:42.781 --> 00:25:45.049
- No offense.
- Now, Hal, now don't make me whoop your ass now.


586
00:25:45.073 --> 00:25:46.740
- Disrespectful, boy.
- What if...


587
00:25:46.823 --> 00:25:48.281
What if, what-what if...

588
00:25:48.365 --> 00:25:51.615
what if this case is the one
that puts you on the map?


589
00:25:51.698 --> 00:25:54.365
What if this case takes you
to a nationwide level?


590
00:25:54.448 --> 00:25:55.781
I'm talking, um...

591
00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:57.698
William Kuntsler,

592
00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:59.823
Clarence Darrow,

593
00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:01.531
Thurgood Marshall.

594
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:06.698
Look, I'm talking...

595
00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:09.615
I'm talking Johnnie motherfucking Cochran.

596
00:26:25.156 --> 00:26:26.906
Well, I've never heard of him.

597
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.198
Was this your idea,
by the way, Mr. Dockins?


598
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:31.073
- Yes.
- No, it was not his idea,


599
00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.990
it was mine, and I realize, Mike,
it might piss you off,


600
00:26:34.073 --> 00:26:35.757
me bringing on additional counsel
like this, but...


601
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:37.448
Piss me off? Not at all.

602
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:39.365
Doesn't piss me... 
Do I seem pissed off?

603
00:26:39.448 --> 00:26:41.281
I'm not pissed off.

604
00:26:41.365 --> 00:26:43.216
Hell, it's your money,
you can do what you want to with it,


605
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.281
I just think you're making a big mistake.

606
00:26:45.365 --> 00:26:47.865
I am trying to put us
in the best possible position


607
00:26:47.948 --> 00:26:49.656
in the event we
end up going to trial.

608
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.781
Got it.

609
00:26:50.865 --> 00:26:52.531
Except we're not going to trial.

610
00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:55.156
Seriously, what's so special
about this guy, anyway?


611
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.948
Hal and I went over to Florida to
watch him try a case in front of a jury,


612
00:26:59.031 --> 00:27:01.365
and I want to tell you,
this man can absolutely,


613
00:27:01.448 --> 00:27:04.115
positively galvanize a jury.

614
00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:06.740
Yes, sir.

615
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.031
Well...

616
00:27:11.115 --> 00:27:13.281
if you believe in him that much,

617
00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:14.948
then sure, okay, 
I'll work with him.

618
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:16.281
I've partnered up before.

619
00:27:16.365 --> 00:27:17.906
Just as long as it's clear

620
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.573
I'm still lead attorney.

621
00:27:21.615 --> 00:27:24.115
Appreciate you being a good sport
about this, Mike.


622
00:27:24.198 --> 00:27:25.990
No problem.

623
00:27:26.073 --> 00:27:27.924
So what time is he supposed
to get here, anyway?


624
00:27:27.948 --> 00:27:29.823
You know, actually,
I think this is them now.


625
00:27:29.906 --> 00:27:31.198

How you doing, Jerry?


633
00:27:48.698 --> 00:27:49.757
- Good to see you, Willie.
- Good to see you, doc.


634
00:27:49.781 --> 00:27:50.924
Good to see you. 
You looking good.

635
00:27:50.948 --> 00:27:52.882
- Thank you.
- Hey, Hal, what you doing over there, huh?


636
00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.049
- It's a pleasure.
- You gettin' younger on me, man?


637
00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:55.673
Huh? What, you on some Dorian Gray shit?

638
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.948
Willie, let me introduce you
to Mike Allred, right here.


639
00:27:58.031 --> 00:27:59.281
Mike.

640
00:27:59.365 --> 00:28:01.156
Now, I understand
we working together, hmm?


641
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.615
So I understand. How you doing, Mr. Gary?

642
00:28:03.698 --> 00:28:05.698
I look like a million, huh?

643
00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:07.906
You look like
ten million Yankee dollars, Willie.


644
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.632
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

645
00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:10.906
I feel good.

646
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.198
This your war room here, huh?

647
00:28:12.281 --> 00:28:14.823
- Uh, well, we got the conference room, you know.
- Mm-hmm.


648
00:28:14.906 --> 00:28:18.156
I like these over there.
I like these books. I like all those.


649
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.573
This is nice, though.

650
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.948
Before we get to work, though...

651
00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:24.351
I hope this doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable, but, uh...


652
00:28:24.406 --> 00:28:25.948
I got some questions
I got to ask you.

653
00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:28.365
Oh, sure. Feel free to ask me anything.
I'm all ears.


654
00:28:28.448 --> 00:28:29.573
Good.

655
00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:32.365
Um, question is, uh...

656
00:28:32.448 --> 00:28:34.531
how do you feel
about working with Black folk?


657
00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:38.031
Man-to-man?

658
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:40.198
Is there any other way?

659
00:28:40.281 --> 00:28:42.156
No, sir. You want an honest answer?

660
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.656
- I need that.
- All right.


661
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.906
Well, if you want an honest answer,

662
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.198
truth be told,
I suppose I am a little prejudiced.


663
00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:49.323
Mm. Okay.

664
00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:50.591
I'm not saying I'm proud of it
or anything.


665
00:28:50.615 --> 00:28:53.007
- I appreciate your honesty.
- In fact, I've been working real hard


666
00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:54.073
on trying to overcome it.

667
00:28:54.156 --> 00:28:55.656
Mm. Well, then you should.

668
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.382
- I'm glad you're working on it.
- But yes.


669
00:28:57.406 --> 00:28:59.781
Did you meet my team?

670
00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:02.281
Hi. I'm Chris.

671
00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.656
Hi, Chris.

672
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.323
Yes. Dashaan.

673
00:29:05.406 --> 00:29:06.531
- Dashaan.
- Mm.


674
00:29:06.615 --> 00:29:08.281
Al.

675
00:29:09.323 --> 00:29:10.698
Reggie Douglas.

676
00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:12.948
Gentlemen.

677
00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:16.990
Okay. Uh...
now that that's all cleared up,


678
00:29:17.073 --> 00:29:18.591
why don't we all just head over
to the conference room,


679
00:29:18.615 --> 00:29:20.406
where the rest of the team
is waiting, yeah?


680
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.031
Jerry. We're gonna work this out,
all right?


681
00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:24.531
- Yeah.
- He's gonna be okay.


682
00:29:24.615 --> 00:29:25.990
Okay, that's fine.

683
00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:29.740
Afternoon, gentlemen. 
How you feeling?

684
00:29:29.823 --> 00:29:31.740
You good? Huh? 
Good, good, good.

685
00:29:31.823 --> 00:29:34.781
For all y'all that don't know who I am,
my name is Willie Gary.


686
00:29:34.865 --> 00:29:36.281
Tell 'em who you are.

687
00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.507
Now, I done brought a couple of partners
of mine from my firm up here from Florida


688
00:29:39.531 --> 00:29:41.198
to help y'all win this case.

689
00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:44.948
And for all of y'all who are unfamiliar
with the Willie Gary style of litigation,


690
00:29:45.031 --> 00:29:46.198
let me break it down to you.

691
00:29:46.281 --> 00:29:48.115
We 'bout to go to war.

692
00:29:48.198 --> 00:29:50.281
'Cause that's what I think litigation is.

693
00:29:50.365 --> 00:29:52.073
Litigation is war.

694
00:29:52.156 --> 00:29:54.323
It's a battle, a battle to the death.

695
00:29:54.406 --> 00:29:56.206
And I'm not talking about
no bullshit, either;


696
00:29:56.281 --> 00:29:59.573
I'm talking about some
Jean-Claude Van Damme ass-kicking shit.


697
00:30:00.573 --> 00:30:03.213
Now I know y'all looking at me crazy,
but that's how I like to get.


698
00:30:04.698 --> 00:30:06.698
And if we don't get crazy
with these motherfuckers,


699
00:30:06.781 --> 00:30:08.281
I'm telling you, this Loewen Group?

700
00:30:08.365 --> 00:30:09.656
They're powerful.

701
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.781
Got a lot of money,
got a lot of influence.


702
00:30:11.865 --> 00:30:14.031
They have everything that we don't.

703
00:30:14.115 --> 00:30:16.698
But we not gonna let them intimidate us.

704
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.615
'Cause I'm not intimidated.

705
00:30:19.698 --> 00:30:22.073
Now, it ain't no secret.

706
00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:24.490
For the past 12 years,
I have not lost a case.


707
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:25.906
And why is that?

708
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.115
Can you tell me why?

709
00:30:27.198 --> 00:30:28.656
'Cause I hate to lose.

710
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.865
I hate it, I
hate it, I hate it!

711
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.240
I'd rather somebody pull a gun on me
and blow my head off


712
00:30:34.323 --> 00:30:36.198
than to lose a case.

713
00:30:38.323 --> 00:30:40.323
Now, that being said...

714
00:30:41.615 --> 00:30:43.841
...there's one thing I'm-a tell you
I'm not gonna bend on.


715
00:30:43.865 --> 00:30:48.115
I do not plan on settling this case.

716
00:30:48.198 --> 00:30:50.115
- We don't do that, no.
- Excuse me.


717
00:30:50.198 --> 00:30:52.615
Anyone mind if I say something here?

718
00:30:52.698 --> 00:30:54.531
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Mr. Gary,


719
00:30:54.615 --> 00:30:57.656
when it comes to the matter of settling,
I'm afraid that's not at all


720
00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.448
the strategy we've developed here.

721
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:03.740
In fact, I've already drafted
a letter to Mr. Loewen


722
00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:06.698
offering to settle at $8 million.

723
00:31:06.781 --> 00:31:08.573
Though, just between us here in this room,

724
00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:11.156
we'd probably be willing to drop
to seven if need be.


725
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.507
Well, Mike, thank you for the update...

726
00:31:12.531 --> 00:31:15.656
appreciate that...
but, unfortunately, things have changed.


727
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.656
We're not settling.

728
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.406
No matter what you said,

729
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.531
the discussion is still on the table

730
00:31:21.615 --> 00:31:24.948
and will remain so until I've decided
what the best course is.


731
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.073
Huh.

732
00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:29.948
Till you decided, huh?

733
00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:33.740
What's going on here, Mike?

734
00:31:33.823 --> 00:31:35.781
Hmm? Who's in charge?

735
00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:38.865
No, seriously, who's in charge?

736
00:31:38.948 --> 00:31:41.341
'Cause you done have Willie Gary
come down here to take over the case


737
00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:43.405
and now here you're telling me
what you're gonna do.


738
00:31:43.448 --> 00:31:46.448
I said we're not settling the case
and that comes from the lead attorney.


739
00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:47.674
- Come again?
- Come again what?


740
00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:50.198
What's the matter?
You need your ears checked or something?


741
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.531
Excuse me, sir.

742
00:31:51.615 --> 00:31:52.841
- No, you're not.
- Mike, you raise a finger to me,


743
00:31:52.865 --> 00:31:54.257
- you'll get your ass whupped in here.
- Boss, calm down.


744
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.799
- Believe me, Mr. Gary, you are not lead attorney.
- Come on, settle down.


745
00:31:56.823 --> 00:31:58.049
- Then what am I, then?
- May I remind you


746
00:31:58.073 --> 00:31:59.615
- you are in my town...
- Your town?


747
00:31:59.698 --> 00:32:01.591
- ...sitting at my conference table...
- Every town I go to, Mike, is my town.


748
00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:03.257
- ...across the table from my client.
- Evidently it ain't your town,


749
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:05.049
- or they wouldn't have called me.
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen.


750
00:32:05.073 --> 00:32:08.698
Gentlemen, could y'all
let the temperature down a little bit?


751
00:32:11.115 --> 00:32:13.406
I didn't come here to fight you, Mike.

752
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.990
- What?
- I said, I didn't come here to fight you.


753
00:32:16.073 --> 00:32:18.281
I came here to get a job done.

754
00:32:18.865 --> 00:32:20.865
Now, Mr. O'Keefe...

755
00:32:20.948 --> 00:32:23.531
Last I checked, he
wants to win this case.

756
00:32:23.615 --> 00:32:27.740
Not toot his ass up in the air
for a funky little $8 million.


757
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.781
Like a bitch.

758
00:32:32.406 --> 00:32:35.406
<i>Jesus Christ, Jerry. 
What's going on?</i>

759
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.406
I think we ought
to give him a chance.

760
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.882
Did you hear that speech he just gave?

761
00:32:38.906 --> 00:32:40.132
He has no idea what he's doing.

762
00:32:40.156 --> 00:32:42.365
He hasn't lost a case in 12 years.

763
00:32:42.448 --> 00:32:44.031
For personal injury cases.

764
00:32:44.115 --> 00:32:46.823
He clearly has no idea about real law,
about contract law.


765
00:32:49.073 --> 00:32:50.656
What about lead attorney?

766
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.948
You're not considering
giving him lead attorney.


767
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:54.365
Yeah.

768
00:32:55.323 --> 00:32:57.115
I am.

769
00:33:04.781 --> 00:33:06.573
We good?

770
00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:08.823
Yeah.

771
00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:10.448
Mike, you good?

772
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:12.490
All right, since we're all good,

773
00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:16.698
uh, does anybody here mind, uh,
taking some dictation?


774
00:33:16.781 --> 00:33:19.698
Cynthia, would you mind
taking dictation for Mr. Gary?


775
00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:22.740
All right, Cynthia. 
I sure appreciate it.

776
00:33:22.823 --> 00:33:24.240
All right.

777
00:33:24.323 --> 00:33:25.823
Address to Mr. Ray Loewen,

778
00:33:25.906 --> 00:33:29.073
Chairman, Loewen Group.

779
00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:31.365
Dear Mr. Loewen,
my name is Willie E. Gary.


780
00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:34.240
I've just been appointed lead counsel

781
00:33:34.323 --> 00:33:38.615
in the suit brought against you
by Jeremiah O'Keefe.


782
00:33:38.698 --> 00:33:41.573
In regards to the prior settlement,

783
00:33:41.656 --> 00:33:46.073
the offer you received of $8 million,

784
00:33:46.156 --> 00:33:49.240
I hereby rescind that offer.

785
00:33:49.323 --> 00:33:52.198
As of the date of
this new letter we have,

786
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:57.781
the new offer is
in the amount of $100 million.


787
00:33:57.865 --> 00:33:59.924
Whoo. That's what I'm talking about.

788
00:33:59.948 --> 00:34:01.573
Did he just say $100 million?

789
00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:03.406
- As in eight zeros?
- $100 million.


790
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.410
Why don't y'all just relax?
Hear what I'm saying?


791
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.156
It's literally $94 million more
than our original claim.


792
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.115
Sounds to me like your original claim
was about $94 million short.


793
00:34:11.198 --> 00:34:12.507
Uh, yeah, Mr. Gary, perhaps you could

794
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:14.007
- help us understand...
- $100 million?


795
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:15.281
It's absurd and you know it.

796
00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:17.240
What you trying to do, destroy this case?

797
00:34:17.323 --> 00:34:20.531
Mike, anybody ever tell you
you got balls the size of a garden slug?


798
00:34:20.615 --> 00:34:23.656
W-Willie, I'm afraid that I agree
with everybody's concerns.


799
00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.698
That's a hell of a lot of money.

800
00:34:25.781 --> 00:34:29.198
We throw out a number like that,
we're gonna humiliate ourselves.


801
00:34:29.281 --> 00:34:30.966
Listen, I understand how you feel, Jerry.

802
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:32.573
But you got to trust me, okay?

803
00:34:32.656 --> 00:34:34.615
- Mm-hmm. Trust him.
- Okay?


804
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.323
Everybody's got to trust me.

805
00:34:36.406 --> 00:34:37.990
- All right?
- Amen.


806
00:34:38.073 --> 00:34:39.865
Now, Cynthia, where were we?

807
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:42.507
<i>"Starting as of the date of this letter,</i>

808
00:34:42.531 --> 00:34:44.656
<i>"our new settlement demand is now</i>

809
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.990
$100 million."

810
00:34:47.073 --> 00:34:48.466
Oh, what?

811
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:50.281
Oh, come on. You
got to be kidding me.

812
00:34:50.365 --> 00:34:51.716
- $100 million?
- Who the hell does he think he is?


813
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.799
- Is he crazy?
- Eight zeros, did you count that?


814
00:34:52.823 --> 00:34:55.281
- Eight zeros.
- There's no way that is not a joke.


815
00:34:55.365 --> 00:34:57.823
- That is a joke.
- It looks like a fucking dozen eggs.


816
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.698
No joke.

817
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.281
Jesus Christ, this O'Keefe guy,
he's a piece of work, no?


818
00:35:04.365 --> 00:35:06.115
Yeah.

819
00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:08.115
Who is this clown
he's hired as a lawyer?

820
00:35:08.198 --> 00:35:11.198
Apparently, some guy
by the name of William Gary.


821
00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:14.115
Thank you, Bob, 
I also read the letter.

822
00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:16.281
But my question is,

823
00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:17.698
who is he?

824
00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:19.031
What's his story?

825
00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:20.740
Where did O'Keefe find him?

826
00:35:20.823 --> 00:35:23.240
From what we could dig up,

827
00:35:23.323 --> 00:35:26.406
he's this kind of flashy
personal injury lawyer,


828
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.115
uh, out of Florida.

829
00:35:28.198 --> 00:35:29.716
- Ambulance-chaser type.
- Personal injury?


830
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.281
This is a contract dispute.

831
00:35:31.365 --> 00:35:34.281
Why the hell would he hire
a personal injury lawyer


832
00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.281
for a contract dispute?

833
00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:38.323
Maybe they don't have any regular lawyers

834
00:35:38.406 --> 00:35:40.326
down in backwater Mississippi.

835
00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:42.365
You should talk like that more.

836
00:35:42.448 --> 00:35:44.656
Turns out, the case was filed
in some remote county


837
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.156
in the lower region of the state,
called Hinds County.


838
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.781
Yeah? So?

839
00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:51.823
So, Hinds County also happens to be

840
00:35:51.906 --> 00:35:55.448
one of the poorest, and about 70%, uh...

841
00:35:56.531 --> 00:35:58.115
...Black.

842
00:35:58.198 --> 00:36:00.115
Oh.

843
00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:02.656
So that's why he was hired.

844
00:36:04.698 --> 00:36:06.365
Because he's Black.

845
00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:09.656
Gary's Black.

846
00:36:12.115 --> 00:36:14.240
He's an African American man.

"Who in so ever it is..."

Reg, you're not understanding the whole...

856
00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:41.823
Sorry to interrupt.

857
00:36:41.906 --> 00:36:43.615
We just got the info you requested

858
00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:45.298
on who Loewen appointed as lead counsel.

859
00:36:45.365 --> 00:36:46.466
- May I see that, please? Thank you.
- Well, who is he?


860
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.698
Do we know him?

861
00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:52.531
- She.
- She?


862
00:36:52.615 --> 00:36:55.073
What you talking about, "she"?

863
00:36:55.156 --> 00:36:56.948
Yeah, what does that mean, "she"?

864
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:59.656
- "She" as in, like, a... like a...
- A woman?


865
00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.531
Her name is Mame Downes.

866
00:37:02.615 --> 00:37:05.448
♪ Ooh... ♪

867
00:37:05.531 --> 00:37:07.865
She graduated with her BA
from Howard University.


868
00:37:07.948 --> 00:37:10.656
Oh. That means she just ain't a woman,

869
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.966
- she's a Black woman.
- She's a sister.


870
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.406
Well, what do you know?

871
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.990
We done got out-Blacked
and out-womaned, all in one go.


872
00:37:23.906 --> 00:37:26.781
Graduated top of her class
from Harvard Law School.


873
00:37:26.865 --> 00:37:28.490
Jesus Christ.

874
00:37:31.948 --> 00:37:33.823
Then went on to clerk two years

875
00:37:33.906 --> 00:37:37.740
for Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.


876
00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:42.948
Three years associate at Paul, Weiss

877
00:37:43.031 --> 00:37:46.365
and now currently
the youngest partner ever


878
00:37:46.448 --> 00:37:48.240
at Cranston, Brown and Atwell.

879
00:37:48.323 --> 00:37:49.723
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, that's impressive.


880
00:37:49.781 --> 00:37:52.406
Friend of mine used to work with her,
over at C, B and A.


881
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.865
And, um...

882
00:37:53.948 --> 00:37:55.823
well...

883
00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:58.906
he told me they had a nickname for her
around the office.


884
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.115
Mm. What was it?

885
00:38:00.198 --> 00:38:01.448
Ain't that right?

886
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:04.031
"The Python."

887
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.948
On account of her
particular style during cross?


888
00:38:07.031 --> 00:38:08.799
- Yes. Yes.
- You know, how she used to strike


889
00:38:08.823 --> 00:38:10.573
when you least expect it.

890
00:38:10.656 --> 00:38:12.365
Mm-hmm. Okay, Ms. Python.

891
00:38:12.448 --> 00:38:14.091
- But you know what?
- Very descriptive.


892
00:38:14.115 --> 00:38:15.740
You know what?

893
00:38:15.823 --> 00:38:18.323
I'm the boa constrictor.

894
00:38:18.406 --> 00:38:19.698
Let's see what she got.

895
00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:22.865
<i>I think we may need
to call the cable company.</i>


896
00:38:22.948 --> 00:38:24.990
Every time I try
and turn on Turner Broadcast,


897
00:38:25.073 --> 00:38:27.823
it's just some weird, empty screen.

898
00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:29.865
Think there's something wrong with it.

899
00:38:29.948 --> 00:38:32.281
There's nothing wrong with it.
I canceled the subscription.


900
00:38:32.365 --> 00:38:35.156
What do you mean, you canceled it?

901
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.615
Annie, those insurance regulators
came by again the other day.


902
00:38:38.698 --> 00:38:41.531
They suspended my license this time.

903
00:38:41.615 --> 00:38:44.865
I'm gonna have to shut the business
down for a while.


904
00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:46.240
What?

905
00:38:47.448 --> 00:38:48.740
What are you talking about?

906
00:38:48.823 --> 00:38:50.740
It's only temporary.

907
00:38:50.823 --> 00:38:53.448
Soon as we get this trial over with,
Loewen makes his restitution,


908
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.323
- we gonna be up and...
- Jerry. Jerry.


909
00:38:55.406 --> 00:38:56.906
You hear yourself?

910
00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.073
As soon as Ray Loewen makes restitution?

911
00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.906
Do you really know for sure
that's even gonna happen?


912
00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:12.573
I mean, you still haven't told me
how we're paying for all this.


913
00:39:13.656 --> 00:39:16.990
That fancy new lawyer
you just brought in from Florida.


914
00:39:17.073 --> 00:39:19.656
You don't have to worry about him.

915
00:39:21.948 --> 00:39:27.115
Well, I just don't understand why you're
continuing with this ridiculous lawsuit.


916
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.198
You can find another buyer

917
00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:30.948
for those three homes.

918
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:32.490
You know that.

919
00:39:33.573 --> 00:39:35.573
Clearly, this is about
something else for you.


920
00:39:35.656 --> 00:39:36.906
Maybe it is.

921
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.156
Maybe I just don't want
to see him get away with it.


922
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.698
Who? Ray Loewen?

923
00:39:42.823 --> 00:39:45.198
My God, Jerry.

924
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:49.240
What is your obsession with this man?

925
00:39:49.323 --> 00:39:51.490
What do you expect me to do, Annie,

926
00:39:51.573 --> 00:39:54.031
just lay back
and let him walk all over me?


927
00:39:54.115 --> 00:39:57.490
Let him walk all over our family?

928
00:39:57.573 --> 00:40:00.823
What I expect you to do

929
00:40:00.906 --> 00:40:03.323
is to think of me,

930
00:40:03.406 --> 00:40:04.906
at some point.

931
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.323
Hmm.

932
00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:09.365
You don't think we can win.

933
00:40:14.365 --> 00:40:16.007
If you want to know
how I'm paying for it,

934
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:17.948
I took out a
third mortgage on this house.

935
00:40:29.698 --> 00:40:31.073
How you doing?

936
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.448
Tell me, Willie,
how'd you wind up being a lawyer?


937
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.240
Mm.

938
00:40:38.406 --> 00:40:40.031
Well, that depends.

939
00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:43.531
You want the, um,
long or the short story?

940
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:44.990
That's up to you.

941
00:40:45.073 --> 00:40:46.698
Well,

942
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:49.281
when I was a young husband,

943
00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:51.698
young father,

944
00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:53.549
me and my wife, we had,
you know, we had a little money,


945
00:40:53.573 --> 00:40:55.656
so we had a little landscaping business.

946
00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.531
Real nice, too.

947
00:40:57.615 --> 00:41:00.156
You know, kept-kept all the yards...

948
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.906
fantastic.

949
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.823
But then my wife was like,
"You know what?


950
00:41:03.906 --> 00:41:05.299
I want to move into a bigger place."

951
00:41:05.323 --> 00:41:06.966
I said, "Well, all right.
Let's do that, then."


952
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.823
And so...

953
00:41:08.906 --> 00:41:10.948
...got the paper, saw this ad.

954
00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:14.615
Three-bedroom apartment, man.
Real nice.


955
00:41:14.698 --> 00:41:16.906
Uh, nice new complex.

956
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:20.240
Over there in a white neighborhood
at, uh, Raintree.


957
00:41:20.323 --> 00:41:22.365
So I said, "Yeah, that's what,
that's what we need."


958
00:41:22.448 --> 00:41:24.115
So I called the owner, 
I said, "Hey, man.

959
00:41:24.198 --> 00:41:27.573
"Me and my family are looking
for a new place.


960
00:41:27.656 --> 00:41:29.281
We want to come to where you are."

961
00:41:29.365 --> 00:41:31.365
I said, "Do you have any vacancies?"

962
00:41:31.448 --> 00:41:34.156
And he says, "Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got plenty of vacancies, you know?


963
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.198
"Matter of fact, uh, at the end
of the month, you can move in.


964
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:38.365
Get your lease."

965
00:41:38.448 --> 00:41:40.198
We all looking forward to that day, man.

966
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.531
I mean, we just excited.

967
00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:43.615
You know, just brand-new beginnings,
if you would.


968
00:41:43.698 --> 00:41:45.240
So when the day comes,

969
00:41:45.323 --> 00:41:46.656
I pack everybody in the car.

970
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.115
I got the-the-the, the boys in there,

971
00:41:49.198 --> 00:41:51.865
I got my-my wife,
I even got my dog in there, man.


972
00:41:51.948 --> 00:41:54.365
And we just happy, man. We happy.

973
00:41:54.448 --> 00:41:56.573
Uh, and we listening to gospel music.

974
00:41:56.656 --> 00:41:58.531
You know, singing, rocking and rolling.

975
00:42:00.156 --> 00:42:01.906
But, um...

976
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.073
when we get there, guy comes out.

977
00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:07.073
I said, "How you doing?" He barely speaks.

978
00:42:07.156 --> 00:42:08.573
He says, "What do you need?"

979
00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:10.257
I said, "I'm the one that, uh,
called you about the vacancies."


980
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:11.990
He said, "What vacancies?"

981
00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:16.031
I said, "I'm Willie Gary.
I called you about the... the vacancies."


982
00:42:16.115 --> 00:42:17.823
He says, "Oh.

983
00:42:17.906 --> 00:42:19.740
We don't have no more vacancies."

984
00:42:23.156 --> 00:42:24.656
What'd you do?

985
00:42:25.906 --> 00:42:27.448
Tell you what I wanted to do.

986
00:42:28.823 --> 00:42:30.490
Wanted to hurt him.

987
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.031
I mean...

988
00:42:33.115 --> 00:42:35.781
disrespecting me like that
in front of my boys, man.


989
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.865
My boys look up to me.

990
00:42:38.948 --> 00:42:40.281
I'm their everything.

991
00:42:40.365 --> 00:42:41.698
What-what do I tell 'em?

992
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:43.156
That...

993
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.656
they daddy ain't good enough
to be in an apartment?


994
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.865
What I tell my queen?

995
00:42:49.906 --> 00:42:51.490
That we not good enough?

996
00:42:56.656 --> 00:42:59.490
But I didn't act out.

997
00:42:59.573 --> 00:43:01.531
What I did was,

998
00:43:01.615 --> 00:43:03.365
I went back to that hotel,

999
00:43:03.448 --> 00:43:05.573
and I opened up the phone book.

1000
00:43:05.656 --> 00:43:08.865
Now, I hadn't even thought about
being a lawyer until this happened.


1001
00:43:08.948 --> 00:43:10.448
I opened it up and I...

1002
00:43:10.531 --> 00:43:13.156
First law school I saw,
I said, "Mm. I'm going right there."


1003
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.448
And I did it.

1004
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.240
I enrolled, worked hard,

1005
00:43:17.323 --> 00:43:18.823
I graduated, I passed the bar.

1006
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.115
And I got my own practice.

1007
00:43:23.115 --> 00:43:25.323
And the first thing I did was

1008
00:43:25.406 --> 00:43:27.823
went down to Raintree Apartments

1009
00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:32.906
and bitch-slapped him with a five-count
discriminatory practices lawsuit.


1010
00:43:35.406 --> 00:43:38.115
Take that for your vacancies.

1011
00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:40.323
You a fighter.

1012
00:43:41.615 --> 00:43:43.031
Yeah.

1013
00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:44.573
Oh, I'm a fighter.

1014
00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:46.740
You are, too, Jerry.
You're a fighter, man.


1015
00:43:46.823 --> 00:43:48.406
You know why I say you're a fighter?

1016
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:52.323
Going up against
this big Loewen Group, man...


1017
00:43:52.406 --> 00:43:54.698
small business owner, man,
that's something, doc.


1018
00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:56.490
That's why we connect.

1019
00:43:56.573 --> 00:43:58.406
What made you want to do it?

1020
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:04.031
'Cause he tried to mess with the one thing
that means the most to me in life:


1021
00:44:04.115 --> 00:44:05.799
being able to leave something behind
for my children


1022
00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:08.156
and my grandchildren when I go.

1023
00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:12.448
They have a legacy, Willie.

1024
00:44:13.615 --> 00:44:16.115
And I do mean to
pass it on to 'em.

1025
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.948
- Let's play some music.
- I like music, Willie.


1026
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:24.323
Good.

1027
00:44:24.406 --> 00:44:26.549
Steve, look, why don't you go up there
and turn on some music?


1028
00:44:26.573 --> 00:44:29.115
Sure thing, boss.
Anything particular you want to hear?


1029
00:44:29.198 --> 00:44:31.406
You know what my jam is, man.
Tony! Toni! Toné!


1030
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.466
- Wise choice, my brother.
- I like that. Like that.


1031
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.007
You know what's crazy about
Tony! Toni! Toné!?


1032
00:44:35.031 --> 00:44:37.073
Ain't none of 'em named Tony.

1033
00:44:37.156 --> 00:44:38.966
Oh, there it is.

1034
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.490

- Hey, hey.
- Hi.


1050
00:45:11.115 --> 00:45:12.466
Welcome to Hotel Intercontinental.

1051
00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.281
Well, thank you. I have a reservation
for Gary, Willie Gary.


1052
00:45:15.365 --> 00:45:16.865
Absolutely.

1053
00:45:16.948 --> 00:45:18.632
- And welcome to Jackson, Mr. Gary.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.


1054
00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:20.424
If you have a credit card
you'd like me to run,


1055
00:45:20.448 --> 00:45:22.240
I can go ahead and
get you all settled in.

1056
00:45:22.323 --> 00:45:23.573
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.


1057
00:45:23.656 --> 00:45:26.424
Hey, hey, so don't look now, but that's,
over there, that's Loewen's legal team.


1058
00:45:26.448 --> 00:45:28.615
Where-where's that? Hmm.

1059
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.823
Jesus Christ.

1060
00:45:33.906 --> 00:45:36.865
It's like a who's who of every prominent
Black lawyer in the country.


1061
00:45:36.948 --> 00:45:38.573
You actually recognize all of them?

1062
00:45:38.656 --> 00:45:41.240
Okay, so, that guy over there,
that's Howard Pfieffer.


1063
00:45:41.323 --> 00:45:43.490
- Mm.
- He's a former state representative


1064
00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:46.198
- and current president of the DC bar association.
- Mm.


1065
00:45:46.281 --> 00:45:48.531
That gentleman there,
that's Richard Mayfield.


1066
00:45:48.615 --> 00:45:50.698
He's one of the leading experts
on antitrust


1067
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.823
and complex business litigation.

1068
00:45:52.906 --> 00:45:55.823
And that gentleman, right over there,
that-that's Walter Bell.


1069
00:45:55.906 --> 00:45:58.115
He's a former
Supreme Court Justice of Mississippi.


1070
00:45:58.198 --> 00:45:59.490
Fuck.

1071
00:45:59.573 --> 00:46:01.656
Man, Loewen must have spent
a fortune on these dudes.


1072
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.132
You know what? She don't actually look
as bad as I thought she was gonna look.


1073
00:46:04.156 --> 00:46:06.615
What's her name?
Uh, uh, Mammy, May, Mame?


1074
00:46:06.698 --> 00:46:07.906
Mammy, Mammy Downes?

1075
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.910
- Seriously? Is that all you have to say?
- Yeah.


1076
00:46:09.948 --> 00:46:12.490
That's all I got to say
'cause they all look like chumps to me.


1077
00:46:13.365 --> 00:46:15.073
Matter of fact, could
you do me a favor?

1078
00:46:15.156 --> 00:46:18.740
Could you send your finest bottle of, uh,
champagne over there to that table?


1079
00:46:18.823 --> 00:46:20.531
Certainly. Do you have a preference?

1080
00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:22.865
- What you got?
- We have Dom, Moët,


1081
00:46:22.948 --> 00:46:24.115
- Cristal...
- Cristal.


1082
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.299
- Cristal.
- That's what we need.


1083
00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:26.424
Send some Cristal over there.

1084
00:46:26.448 --> 00:46:29.281
Make sure that you say that it's, uh,
compliments of Mr. Willie Gary.


1085
00:46:29.365 --> 00:46:31.031
Hey. Seriously, man?

1086
00:46:31.115 --> 00:46:33.073
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, seriously, Hal.


1087
00:46:33.156 --> 00:46:34.573
- Shut up.
- Uh...


1088
00:46:34.656 --> 00:46:37.656
Listen, I always say this:

1089
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.865
You see me fighting a bear?
Pour honey on me.


1090
00:46:39.948 --> 00:46:42.656
We're just gonna pour a little honey.

1091
00:46:44.323 --> 00:46:46.156
<i>Well, we keep the strategy simple.</i>

1092
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.448
<i>Firmly cementing
the validity of the document</i>


1093
00:46:48.531 --> 00:46:50.615
as a contract in the jury's mind.

1094
00:46:50.698 --> 00:46:52.823
That's definitely gonna be
the defense strategy, too.


1095
00:46:52.906 --> 00:46:55.323
Except they'll be focused on proving
how it's not a contract.


1096
00:46:55.406 --> 00:46:56.882
Okay, look,
we got to be honest about this.


1097
00:46:56.906 --> 00:46:59.091
They're likely gonna be
a lot better at this than we are,


1098
00:46:59.115 --> 00:47:01.573
considering this is
their area of expertise.


1099
00:47:01.656 --> 00:47:05.240
I-I say we just forget
about all that contract mumbo jumbo.


1100
00:47:05.323 --> 00:47:07.865
Bog the jury down
with a whole bunch of information


1101
00:47:07.948 --> 00:47:09.049
that we know they ain't interested in.

1102
00:47:09.073 --> 00:47:11.031
Personally, what I think we gotta do...

1103
00:47:11.115 --> 00:47:12.781
what we gotta prove, rather...

1104
00:47:12.865 --> 00:47:14.198
is motive.

1105
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:16.240
We center our argument
squarely on the issue


1106
00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:18.740
of Loewen Group stalling on closing.

1107
00:47:18.823 --> 00:47:20.383
And show what they
had to gain from it.

1108
00:47:20.448 --> 00:47:22.990
- Uh, I'm not so sure.
- What? What, Hal?


1109
00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.549
- What-what you ain't sure about?
- What? Hal?


1110
00:47:24.573 --> 00:47:26.257
What I mean is,
I'm not so sure we can actually prove


1111
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:28.406
that the Loewen Group had motive.

1112
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.716
Right? Unless we have
some kind of internal company memo.


1113
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.031
Or someone just openly admits it.

1114
00:47:33.115 --> 00:47:34.990
Like, how do you actually prove

1115
00:47:35.073 --> 00:47:36.823
that the stalling was intentional?

1116
00:47:36.906 --> 00:47:39.948
Well, we're obviously never
going to be able to prove that.


1117
00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:45.781
Truth is, we don't have a snowball's
chance in hell of winning this case.

1139
00:48:46.406 --> 00:48:48.490
You know,
I've actually never did this before.


1140
00:48:48.573 --> 00:48:52.781

with the opposing counsel, the...


1141
00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:54.906
drinks and things like that, you know.

1142
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.740
Music, candles.

1143
00:48:56.823 --> 00:48:58.865
It's like we almost, uh,

1144
00:48:58.948 --> 00:49:00.865
on a date.

1145
00:49:04.198 --> 00:49:05.865
Or maybe not.

1146
00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:11.240
You say you're from Compton,
but I'm trying to understand


1147
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:14.448
why you taking all these
fancy white cases.


1148
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:16.031
I could ask you the same question.

1149
00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:18.240
- Couldn't I?
- Yeah, well, I actually believe


1150
00:49:18.323 --> 00:49:19.781
in my case, Ms. Downes.

1151
00:49:19.865 --> 00:49:21.507
Oh, well, I actually believe in mine, too,
Mr. Gary.


1152
00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:22.990
Well, that puts us in a very

1153
00:49:23.073 --> 00:49:24.174
- precarious situation then, all right,
- Does it?


1154
00:49:24.198 --> 00:49:26.118
because one of us gonna win
and one's gonna lose.


1155
00:49:26.198 --> 00:49:27.549
- I think that's how this goes, yes.
- Mm-hmm.


1156
00:49:27.573 --> 00:49:29.865
But it's different
in my situation, because


1157
00:49:29.948 --> 00:49:31.698
I'm actually Black employed.

1158
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:33.573
See, I don't work for the man.

1159
00:49:33.656 --> 00:49:35.132
- Oh.
- See, I-I work for Willie Gary,


1160
00:49:35.156 --> 00:49:36.823
which is myself. I'm employed

1161
00:49:36.906 --> 00:49:38.406
- to myself...
- Tell me, tell me.


1162
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.031
- ...for myself.
- Where should I be working, huh?


1163
00:49:41.115 --> 00:49:42.906
You tell me. Come on. School me.

1164
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.781
What-what tiny little piece of the pie

1165
00:49:44.865 --> 00:49:47.198
would you be comfortable
allotting to someone like me?


1166
00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:49.365
What, should I be working pro bono?

1167
00:49:49.448 --> 00:49:51.257
Or maybe I should be in
some shitty DA's office,


1168
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:52.781
trying eviction cases.

1169
00:49:52.865 --> 00:49:54.156
Would that make you comfortable?

1170
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.924
- Would you be more happy with that?
- Hold on a second.


1171
00:49:55.948 --> 00:49:58.615
Hold on, hold on.
We-we-we not at trial right now.


1172
00:49:58.698 --> 00:50:01.823
You said you were trying to school me,
so come on, now, school me.


1173
00:50:01.906 --> 00:50:05.448
I don't know how much you know about me,
but I'm the son of a sharecropper.


1174
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:07.990
I was eight years old

1175
00:50:08.073 --> 00:50:10.740
out there in them sugarcane fields,
you know.


1176
00:50:10.823 --> 00:50:12.448
Working. Me.

1177
00:50:12.531 --> 00:50:14.865
But now, you know, I got...

1178
00:50:14.948 --> 00:50:17.656
you know, mansions and...

1179
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.906
Rolls
-Royce and Bentleys.

1180
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.906
- My own private plane.
- I mean,


1181
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.656
what it sounds like is

1182
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.615
we're both living our own little version
of the American dream.


1183
00:50:27.698 --> 00:50:29.990
A little less red, white and blue

1184
00:50:30.073 --> 00:50:32.615
and a little more, uh, um...

1185
00:50:32.698 --> 00:50:35.073
caramel and stripes and...

1186
00:50:40.156 --> 00:50:42.740
Although, I do believe that the

1187
00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:45.584
Black American dream is quite different
than the white American dream.


1188
00:50:45.656 --> 00:50:46.740
Case in point.

1189
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.115
O.J. trial, hmm?

1190
00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:51.591
Supposed to be the "trial of the century."

1191
00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.031
It's a circus.

1192
00:50:53.115 --> 00:50:54.198
You want to go there?

1193
00:50:54.281 --> 00:50:56.115
Nah, that's murky territory.

1194
00:50:56.198 --> 00:50:57.615
Where you leaning?

1195
00:50:57.698 --> 00:51:00.365
Is... is he innocent? 
Or is he guilty?

1196
00:51:00.448 --> 00:51:02.281
Doesn't matter.

1197
00:51:02.365 --> 00:51:04.948
'Cause O.J.'s not the one
that's on trial right now.


1198
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:07.115
White frontier justice,

1199
00:51:07.198 --> 00:51:08.990
- that's what's on trial.
- Mm.


1200
00:51:09.073 --> 00:51:11.240
I hear that.

1201
00:51:11.323 --> 00:51:12.948
Gun to your head, though.

1202
00:51:13.031 --> 00:51:14.424
- Gun to my head?
- Gun to your head.


1203
00:51:14.448 --> 00:51:15.674
- I don't know now.
- Gun to your head,


1204
00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:17.674
- Ms. Downes, gun to your head.
- Come on, trying to put a gun to my head.


1205
00:51:17.698 --> 00:51:19.049
- Does anyone hear this?
- Got a gun... gun to your head now.


1206
00:51:19.073 --> 00:51:20.740
Oh, hell nah.

1207
00:51:20.823 --> 00:51:22.716
Opportunity to be the lead counsel
on the defense


1208
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.115
or a opportunity to be
the lead prosecutor,


1209
00:51:25.198 --> 00:51:27.156
which one do you choose?

1210
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.156
Oh, that's... that's a tricky one.

1211
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.200
- Yeah, I know. It's tough, it's tough.
- Defense.


1212
00:51:32.615 --> 00:51:34.115
His ass is guilty.

1213
00:51:34.198 --> 00:51:37.406
And I've never defended someone
who I knew was guilty before.


1214
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.406
You know what they say:

1215
00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.490
Lawyer's got to try that at least once.

1216
00:51:41.573 --> 00:51:43.031
Remember these words:

1217
00:51:43.115 --> 00:51:44.906
- if it doesn't fit...
- Hmm.


1218
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.531
...you must acquit.

1219
00:51:48.823 --> 00:51:49.948
Prosecution.

1220
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:51.240
Yeah?

1221
00:51:51.323 --> 00:51:53.365
I have this reoccurring dream

1222
00:51:53.448 --> 00:51:55.698
that I'm prosecuting a case

1223
00:51:55.781 --> 00:51:59.115
against that slick-ass Johnnie Cochran.

1224
00:51:59.198 --> 00:52:01.341
- Mm.
- Him in all them fancy suits and shit...


1225
00:52:01.365 --> 00:52:03.573
Okay. Well, how does this dream end?

1226
00:52:03.656 --> 00:52:05.615
I wipe the floor with him.

1227
00:52:06.615 --> 00:52:08.781
I wipe the floor with his ass.

1228
00:52:11.823 --> 00:52:13.156
Oh.

1229
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.615
Let me get that.

1230
00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.906
Oh, absolutely not.

1231
00:52:17.406 --> 00:52:19.531
You were so, uh,

1232
00:52:19.615 --> 00:52:22.531
you were so kind

1234
00:52:23.906 --> 00:52:25.281
- What was that called?
- Cristal.


1235
00:52:26.406 --> 00:52:28.990
Allow me to return the favor,
just this once.


1236
00:52:29.073 --> 00:52:31.656
Although, I wouldn't get too used

1237
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.240
to me being kind to you, Mr. Gary.

1238
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.198
Once we begin that... trial...

1239
00:52:38.281 --> 00:52:40.073
nigga, I will destroy you.

1240
00:52:42.781 --> 00:52:44.448

Let me start off
by saying that this case

1246
00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:06.406
that you're about to hear

1247

deals with the oldest sin known to man.

1252
00:53:27.323 --> 00:53:28.466
You're pointing too much, Gary.

00:53:59.365 --> 00:54:01.406
- What's the matter?
- We can't split the pole.


1264
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.549
Can't split the pole. Now come on.

1265
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:04.854
- No, come on, we can't split the pole.
- This new to you?

The court is now in session,
pursuant to the adjournment.


1271
00:54:21.448 --> 00:54:23.365
Hear ye, hear ye.

1272
00:54:23.448 --> 00:54:26.781
All persons having business
with this honorable court, draw near.

Give your attention
and you shall be heard.


1274
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:32.240
The Honorable Judge James E. Graves,

1275
00:54:32.323 --> 00:54:34.448
circuit county judge
for the First Judicial District


1276
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:36.781
of Hinds County, 
Mississippi, presiding.

1277
00:54:38.406 --> 00:54:40.865
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1278
00:54:41.948 --> 00:54:43.281
How y'all doing?

1279
00:54:44.365 --> 00:54:45.740
Thank you for being here.

1280
00:54:45.823 --> 00:54:49.240
This case here is really about
the oldest sin known to man.


1281
00:54:49.323 --> 00:54:50.448
<i>Contracts.</i>

1282
00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:51.990
Plain and simple.

1283
00:54:52.073 --> 00:54:54.490
Now, Mr. Gary would have you believe

1284
00:54:54.573 --> 00:54:56.323
that this case is about...

1285
00:54:56.406 --> 00:54:57.674
- Greed.
<i>- And while that sounds,</i>


1286
00:54:57.698 --> 00:55:01.698
uh, entertaining and a bit dramatic...

1287
00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:03.966
We know for a fact
that the deal had already been approved


1288
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:05.365
by Loewen and his board.

1289
00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:08.531
They crafted every single aspect,
outlined it,


1290
00:55:08.615 --> 00:55:10.073
and put it down in writing.

1291
00:55:10.323 --> 00:55:11.365
That's a contract.

1292
00:55:11.448 --> 00:55:13.573
How can it be a binding contract

1293
00:55:13.656 --> 00:55:14.906
between two parties

1294
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:17.323
if one of the parties
didn't sign the contract?


1295
00:55:17.406 --> 00:55:19.406
Y'all, these people lie.

1296
00:55:21.906 --> 00:55:23.490
That's what it boils down to.

1297
00:55:23.573 --> 00:55:27.406
So why did Mr. O'Keefe
have such a-a-a panic,


1298
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.573
such an urgency,

1299
00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:31.406
such a desperation

1300
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.365
for this deal to close?

1301
00:55:33.448 --> 00:55:34.948
Why?

1302
00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:38.240
Well, because everything in his life

1303
00:55:38.323 --> 00:55:39.906
hinged on this deal.

1304
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.448
Everything.

1305
00:55:41.531 --> 00:55:43.240
For the Loewen Group, not so much.

1306
00:55:43.323 --> 00:55:45.823
They had one goal in mind.

1307
00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:48.615
Stall him out.

1308
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.240
Stall him out.

1309
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.865
It wasn't personal.

1310
00:55:53.948 --> 00:55:55.615
He just got impatient.

1311
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.823
<i>In fact, there is such a thing</i>

1312
00:56:10.906 --> 00:56:14.573
uh, as an anticipatory breach of contract.

1313
00:56:14.656 --> 00:56:16.323
And this is when,

1314
00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:20.031
though the actual breach
has not yet occurred,


1315
00:56:20.115 --> 00:56:22.323
one of the involved parties,

1316
00:56:22.406 --> 00:56:27.240
heretofore referred to
as the "soon to be breaching party,"


1317
00:56:27.323 --> 00:56:29.490
will not fulfill their obligations

1318
00:56:29.573 --> 00:56:32.948
set forth by the terms of the agreement.

1319
00:56:33.031 --> 00:56:37.031
When a situation like this arises,

1320
00:56:37.115 --> 00:56:40.448
it is my opinion that...

1321
00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:45.031
...it is well within the means of dispute

1322
00:56:45.115 --> 00:56:46.865
for this contract.

1323
00:56:46.948 --> 00:56:47.988
- Wake your ass up!
- Whoa!


1324
00:56:48.031 --> 00:56:49.031
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.


1325
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:50.323
Wake up!

1326
00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:51.924
What are we doing?
We sit up in these books,


1327
00:56:51.948 --> 00:56:53.948
talking about contracts every single day.

1328
00:56:54.031 --> 00:56:55.281
For what?

1329
00:56:55.365 --> 00:56:57.823
We putting 'em to sleep.

1330
00:56:57.906 --> 00:57:00.448
We done lost our connection,
lost our edge.


1331
00:57:00.531 --> 00:57:02.615
And what do I get from y'all? Nothing.

1332
00:57:05.073 --> 00:57:06.740
I gotta make the decision.

1333
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:08.740
I'm-a put Jerry on.

1334
00:57:10.615 --> 00:57:12.490
- No, no, no.
- You can't do that.


1335
00:57:12.573 --> 00:57:14.174
We put him on next week.

1336
00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:15.924
You hard of hearing?
I'm putting him on.


1337
00:57:15.948 --> 00:57:17.966
We got to shake it up.
And plus, he's a great witness.


1338
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:21.115
You said it yourself. He's a good witness,
he's honest, he's-he's-he's,


1339
00:57:21.198 --> 00:57:22.698
he's a family man,

1340
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:24.198
he's-he's a war hero.

1341
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:25.615
To civil-civil rights.

1342
00:57:25.698 --> 00:57:27.156
Everything he did for Black folk?

1343
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.632
We put him in front of that jury,
he gonna play 'em.


1344
00:57:28.656 --> 00:57:30.674
It is much too soon
to put Jerry on the stand.


1345
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:32.966
It's much too early in the trial.
We don't have all the information yet.


1346
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:34.424
It ain't never too soon with me, Mike.

1347
00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:35.924
- It's never too soon with me.
- Willie.


1348
00:57:35.948 --> 00:57:37.132
We know nothing about Mame yet.

1349
00:57:37.156 --> 00:57:39.781
We've only seen her interview,
what, technical witnesses?


1350
00:57:39.865 --> 00:57:42.115
We know nothing
about her real cross-examination style.


1351
00:57:42.198 --> 00:57:44.323
Nor know how actually dangerous she is.

1352
00:57:44.406 --> 00:57:46.507
Y'all don't know y'all ass
from a hole in the ground.


1353
00:57:46.531 --> 00:57:48.990
Now I made the decision.

1354
00:57:49.073 --> 00:57:51.573
You can either get on board
or you can get the fuck out.


1355
00:57:54.823 --> 00:57:56.466
<i>Let's talk about some of your values.</i>

1356
00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.865
<i>Because, if I'm not mistaken, Jerry,
you an eight-time decorated hero.</i>


1357
00:57:59.948 --> 00:58:01.906
<i>You got the Air Medal, the Navy Medal.</i>

1358
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:05.198
<i>You got the, you got the Flying Cross.</i>

1359
00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:08.865
<i>And you did all of that
in the sacrifice for your country.</i>


1360
00:58:08.948 --> 00:58:11.615
Well, I don't think war's anything
to be celebrated.


1361
00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:14.865
But I did serve my country
and quite proudly.


1362
00:58:14.948 --> 00:58:16.615
Hmm. Thank you for your service.

1363
00:58:18.073 --> 00:58:20.323
But you didn't stop there.
You came back to your county,


1364
00:58:20.406 --> 00:58:21.632
you took over the family business,

1365
00:58:21.656 --> 00:58:23.615
and then, uh, you did what I call

1366
00:58:23.698 --> 00:58:25.591
you jumped out of the frying pan
and into the fire, man.


1367
00:58:25.615 --> 00:58:27.615
You wanted to be in politics, didn't you?

1368
00:58:27.698 --> 00:58:29.573
You ran for mayor
in your home town in Biloxi.


1369
00:58:29.656 --> 00:58:31.615
I ran twice and
served two terms as mayor,

1370
00:58:31.698 --> 00:58:35.615
from 1974 until 1982.

1371
00:58:35.698 --> 00:58:37.448
And I understand, in one of those terms,

1372
00:58:37.531 --> 00:58:40.990
that a very friendly group of people
came to visit you.


1373
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:43.448
The Ku Klux Klan.

1374
00:58:43.531 --> 00:58:45.031
Objection, Your Honor.

1375
00:58:45.115 --> 00:58:47.365
What is the relevance
to this line of questioning?


1376
00:58:47.448 --> 00:58:49.007
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- We are in a case about contracts,


1377
00:58:49.031 --> 00:58:50.490
Your Honor.

1378
00:58:50.573 --> 00:58:52.573
You may answer that question.

1379
00:58:54.198 --> 00:58:57.406
I denied them a permit
to demonstrate in Biloxi.


1380
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.573
You told the Ku Klux Klan

1381
00:59:01.656 --> 00:59:04.615
in Biloxi, Mississippi, "No."

1382
00:59:04.698 --> 00:59:07.323
Now, flying warplanes is one thing,

1383
00:59:07.406 --> 00:59:10.490
but to tell the Klan "no" at that time,
that's a different type of bravery.


1384
00:59:12.781 --> 00:59:15.323
Jerry, I've gotten
an opportunity to know you.


1385
00:59:15.406 --> 00:59:16.990
You and your family.

1386
00:59:17.073 --> 00:59:19.906
But these good folks here have not.

1387
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:23.240
I just want to ask you,
what are your values?


1388
00:59:23.323 --> 00:59:26.406
What is important to you?

1389
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.906
Mr. O'Keefe.

1390
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.823
Good day. How are you?

1391
00:59:31.906 --> 00:59:33.656
I'm doing well, thank you.

1392
00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.656
You are? Good.

1393
00:59:50.156 --> 00:59:51.156
Uh...

1394
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.906
having just listened to the testimony
you gave,


1395
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:58.448
I think it's fair to say
that the real, material substance


1396
00:59:58.531 --> 01:00:01.281
centered on character.
Would you agree?


1397
01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.365
Yes. I
-I agree.

1398
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.865
I couldn't hear that. 
Can you speak up?

1399
01:00:06.948 --> 01:00:08.990
I said yes, ma'am, I agree.

1400
01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.615
Okay, character.

1401
01:00:10.698 --> 01:00:13.115
Let's talk about character.

1402
01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:15.656
The overall insinuation
being made is that,


1403
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.948
while you are a man of honor,

1404
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.656
of strong moral principles,

1405
01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.990
according to you, my client is not.

1406
01:00:25.198 --> 01:00:28.656
I think Mr. Loewen and I have
very different approaches to...


1407
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.781
as to how to
deal with people in business.

1408
01:00:30.865 --> 01:00:32.990
Ah. "In business."

1409
01:00:33.073 --> 01:00:35.365
Yes. Right, okay.

1410
01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:37.781
Something I'm curious about...

1411
01:00:37.865 --> 01:00:42.490
How did you end up needing to sell
those funeral homes to Mr. Loewen?


1412
01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:45.240
Well, I had run into a little bit
of financial trouble.


1413
01:00:45.323 --> 01:00:47.573
What kind of financial trouble?

1414
01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:52.406
Huh?

1415
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.240
Because I'm, uh, pretty sure

1416
01:00:55.323 --> 01:00:59.740
the actual reason you so desperately
needed to sell at the time that you did


1417
01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.865
is because the Mississippi
state insurance commission


1418
01:01:02.948 --> 01:01:04.781
was about to revoke your license.

1419
01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:05.990
Is that correct?

1420
01:01:06.073 --> 01:01:08.198
As a matter of fact, your license

1421
01:01:08.281 --> 01:01:11.240
to sell insurance
in the state of Mississippi


1422
01:01:11.323 --> 01:01:13.740
is currently under suspension.

1423
01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:15.503
Can we agree that
that is a true statement,


1424
01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:17.131
- Mr. O'Keefe?
- No, we cannot.


1425
01:01:17.198 --> 01:01:19.906
Because it's a lot more
complicated than that.


1426
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.740
Enlighten me.
How is it more complicated?


1427
01:01:21.823 --> 01:01:23.698
Was your license suspended

1428
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.299
- or was it not?
- Objection, Your Honor,


1429
01:01:25.323 --> 01:01:28.198
- on the simple fact that she's just angry.
- Overruled.


1430
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:30.007
- It's a yes or no question.
- We already knew


1431
01:01:30.031 --> 01:01:31.632
- that he was in financial trouble.
- He said "overruled."


1432
01:01:31.656 --> 01:01:32.865
Overruled.

1433
01:01:32.948 --> 01:01:35.031
Well, the real truth here is that

1434
01:01:35.115 --> 01:01:37.823
you lost your license

1435
01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:42.448
because you got involved in some
shady savings and loans business deal


1436
01:01:42.531 --> 01:01:45.531
with a man that, if I'm
-I'm not mistaken,

1437
01:01:45.615 --> 01:01:48.573
is currently in jail right now.

1438
01:01:48.656 --> 01:01:50.091
- Your Honor, objection.
- Can I ask you something?


1439
01:01:50.115 --> 01:01:51.257
This is not on trial here today.

1440
01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:52.549
- Overruled.
- Was the money that you used


1441
01:01:52.573 --> 01:01:54.865
to finance this deal,
was that money yours?


1442
01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:56.740
I was responsible for that money.

1443
01:01:56.823 --> 01:01:58.573
You used other people's money.

1444
01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:01.448
Actually, you used your clients' money

1445
01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:05.323
to finance your involvement
in said "business deal"


1446
01:02:05.406 --> 01:02:07.781
with a now-convicted felon.

1447
01:02:07.865 --> 01:02:09.049
- Am I correct?
- Objection, Your Honor.


1448
01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.448
Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?

1449
01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:11.799
- This has nothing to do with this case.
- Overruled.


1450
01:02:11.823 --> 01:02:14.132
- Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?
- That's not how I would characterize


1451
01:02:14.156 --> 01:02:15.341
- this at all.
- I mean, is it possible


1452
01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:16.865
that this entire case

1453
01:02:16.948 --> 01:02:18.198
stems from jealousy?

1454
01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:19.882
Objection, Your Honor.
We're talking about emotions?


1455
01:02:19.906 --> 01:02:20.946
- Jealousy?
- I mean,


1456
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.341
- Mr. O'Keefe...
- Overruled.


1457
01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:24.656
...you said yourself that
you and Mr. Loewen have


1458
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.174
very different ways of doing business,

1459
01:02:26.198 --> 01:02:28.716
and that might be the truest statement
you've said all day long,


1460
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.365
because, like you,

1461
01:02:30.448 --> 01:02:33.531
Mr. Loewen inherited a business
from his father.


1462
01:02:33.615 --> 01:02:35.698
However, unlike you, he was able to build

1463
01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:38.906
that business into
a multimillion-dollar empire.


1464
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:42.323
Meanwhile, what has become
of your father's legacy?


1465
01:02:56.156 --> 01:02:57.573
Jerry! Hold up, now!

1466
01:02:57.656 --> 01:02:59.115
Jerry! Wait up, will you?

1467
01:02:59.198 --> 01:03:00.323
Jerry.

1468
01:03:00.406 --> 01:03:01.990
What in the hell was that?

1469
01:03:02.073 --> 01:03:03.281
What you talking about?

1470
01:03:03.365 --> 01:03:05.698
I
-I don't understand. 
You angry with me?

1471
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:06.948
Am I angry with you?

1472
01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:08.299
You were supposed to protect me up there.

1473
01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:09.948
Supposed to make sure I was safe

1474
01:03:10.031 --> 01:03:11.507
under cross-examination and all that shit.

1475
01:03:11.531 --> 01:03:13.882
That ain't my fault. I didn't know
she was gonna ask you all that.


1476
01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:15.257
It's your job to know
what she's gonna ask me.


1477
01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:16.424
You didn't tell me all this shit.

1478
01:03:16.448 --> 01:03:18.966
You told me about the-the savings
and loan, you told me about the money,


1479
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.632
but you didn't tell me nothing
about him going to jail.


1480
01:03:20.656 --> 01:03:21.906
When I made the deal with him,

1481
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:23.490
he was not a felon.

1482
01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:24.757
I had every reason to believe that

1483
01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:25.841
- that was a good, solid deal.
- I understand.


1484
01:03:25.865 --> 01:03:28.156
But I can't read your mind.
That's not my fault.


1485
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.073
Of course it is.
Since the first day I hired you,


1486
01:03:31.156 --> 01:03:32.740
you have been trying to turn this case

1487
01:03:32.823 --> 01:03:34.948
into your own, personal one-ring circus.

1488
01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:37.156
I've done everything I can
to try to save your ass.


1489
01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.115
I put every dime
I have into this deal,

1490
01:03:39.198 --> 01:03:40.716
- and you're still fucking around.
- I understand. I'm not fucking around.


1491
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.966
Listen, that ain't fair.
That's not fair, Jerry.


1492
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:43.299
You don't have anything
on the line here, Willie.


1493
01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:45.406
When this case is
over, win, lose or draw,

1494
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.573
you're gonna get in your airplane
and fly away.


1495
01:03:47.656 --> 01:03:49.573
I'm gonna be here.
I got plenty on the line.


1496
01:03:49.656 --> 01:03:50.841
I got my damn life on the line,

1497
01:03:50.865 --> 01:03:52.257
and I don't know
how much of that's left.

1498
01:03:52.281 --> 01:03:53.698
I know that, Jerry.

1499
01:03:55.948 --> 01:03:57.365
I'm making a decision.

1500
01:03:57.448 --> 01:03:59.740
A decision for what, Jerry?

1501
01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:02.323
I'm gonna replace you as lead attorney.

1502
01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:07.990
For Mike?

1503
01:04:08.073 --> 01:04:09.823
That's what you're doing? Huh?

1504
01:04:09.906 --> 01:04:11.281
I'm telling you right now, Jerry,

1505
01:04:11.365 --> 01:04:13.323
that's a huge mistake!

1506
01:04:34.031 --> 01:04:36.448
Shit.

1507
01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:39.031
Hey.

1508
01:04:39.115 --> 01:04:40.531
Hey, baby.

1509
01:04:41.781 --> 01:04:43.865
What you doing?

1510
01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:46.490
Just doing a little bit of reading.

1511
01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:48.323
You-you sound a little down, baby.

1512
01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:50.156
Is everything okay?

1513
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.531
No, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm good.
I'm good. Uh...


1514
01:04:52.615 --> 01:04:53.906
- Okay.
- No, no.


1515
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.781
- Well...
- No, I, uh...


1516
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.073
- I got replaced.
- What?


1517
01:05:01.156 --> 01:05:02.323
I said, I got replaced.

1518
01:05:02.406 --> 01:05:04.365
- They replaced me.
- No.


1519
01:05:04.448 --> 01:05:05.781
What?

1520
01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:08.656
- Yeah, Jerry...
- Replaced you?


1521
01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.490
Baby, what does that mean?

1522
01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:14.573
It means that, uh, they want...

1523
01:05:14.656 --> 01:05:17.573
they want somebody else
to be lead counsel and so, uh...


1524
01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:20.865
...so they replaced me.

1525
01:05:23.448 --> 01:05:25.115
- Uh...
- Honey, really?


1526
01:05:26.198 --> 01:05:27.573
But wait. I don't understand.

1527
01:05:27.656 --> 01:05:29.615
Why would he do that?

1528
01:05:29.698 --> 01:05:31.823
Why?

1529
01:05:31.906 --> 01:05:33.281
I, uh...

1530
01:05:33.365 --> 01:05:35.823
I screwed up. Screwed up.

1531
01:05:35.906 --> 01:05:37.323
I screwed up.

1532
01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.281
I screwed up by, uh...

1533
01:05:41.865 --> 01:05:44.990
I put Jerry on the stand
and I-I didn't have him prepared enough,


1534
01:05:45.073 --> 01:05:47.531
and when they, uh,
did the cross-examination, they, uh...


1535
01:05:49.198 --> 01:05:50.615
...they annihilated him.

1536
01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:53.365
They, uh... It was bad.

1537
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.781
It's got me upset. I'm upset.

1538
01:05:57.865 --> 01:06:00.948
The-the reason that I'm upset
is because I...


1539
01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:03.573
Seeing... seeing Jerry so upset,

1540
01:06:03.656 --> 01:06:06.156
it-it's got me upset, so I'm just...

1541
01:06:07.365 --> 01:06:09.240
- I see.
- I'm upset about it.


1542
01:06:10.323 --> 01:06:13.031
You sound like you really care
about this man.


1543
01:06:15.115 --> 01:06:16.698
Jerry?

1544
01:06:16.781 --> 01:06:18.490
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1545
01:06:18.573 --> 01:06:21.031
Yeah, I care. Jerry's a cool guy.

1546
01:06:56.906 --> 01:06:59.198
Hi. Pardon me.

1547
01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:03.240
Are you, by any chance,
Mrs. Lorraine McGrath?


1548
01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:05.031
Well...

1549
01:07:05.115 --> 01:07:06.490
well, yes, but I...

1550
01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:09.323
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to be rude, I...

1551
01:07:09.406 --> 01:07:12.156
It's just I was kind of expecting
a lawyer.


1552
01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:15.198
Yeah, I am a lawyer.

1553
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.365
I'm the guy you spoke with on the phone,
Hal Dockins?


1554
01:07:18.448 --> 01:07:19.490
Oh.

1555
01:07:19.573 --> 01:07:21.448
I'm so sorry. Uh...

1556
01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:23.115
I hope I didn't offend you.

1557
01:07:23.198 --> 01:07:26.365
It just... uh, well, to be honest,
you look very young.


1558
01:07:29.281 --> 01:07:31.201
- Here y'all go.
- Thank you.


1559
01:07:35.198 --> 01:07:39.115
I worked at a Loewen-owned funeral home
for 13 years.


1560
01:07:42.365 --> 01:07:44.115
Just... in all that time,

1561
01:07:44.198 --> 01:07:47.698
I saw a lot, you know,

1562
01:07:47.781 --> 01:07:52.073
about how that company operates.

1563
01:07:52.156 --> 01:07:53.531
Before we go any further,

1564
01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:55.198
I just have to ask you:

1565
01:07:55.281 --> 01:07:57.740
would you be willing to testify?

1566
01:08:06.073 --> 01:08:07.865
Mrs. McGrath, hi.

1567
01:08:07.948 --> 01:08:10.281
How you doing this afternoon?

1568
01:08:10.365 --> 01:08:12.823
Um, very well, thank you.

1569
01:08:12.906 --> 01:08:14.573
That's fine. That's just fine.

1570
01:08:15.865 --> 01:08:17.740
Mrs. McGrath, would you mind telling us

1571
01:08:17.823 --> 01:08:19.448
how long you worked as an employee

1572
01:08:19.531 --> 01:08:22.573
for the Durbin and Sons Funeral Home
in Southaven, Mississippi?


1573
01:08:22.656 --> 01:08:24.615
Um, I worked at that funeral home

1574
01:08:24.698 --> 01:08:26.990
for about 13 years before I quit.

1575
01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:28.406
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.490
And did you witness any transfer
of ownership during this time period?


1577
01:08:32.573 --> 01:08:33.865
Um...

1578
01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:39.365
Uh, uh, Durbin and Sons was bought
by the Loewen Group


1579
01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.073
sometime around 1990.

1580
01:08:42.156 --> 01:08:44.240
And I was there during that time.

1581
01:08:45.365 --> 01:08:47.781
And did you notice any changes

1582
01:08:47.865 --> 01:08:49.698
in the way the company was run

1583
01:08:49.781 --> 01:08:52.448
after the Loewen Group took over?

1584
01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:55.073
Uh, the most significant was, uh,

1585
01:08:55.156 --> 01:08:56.698
how they implemented this,

1586
01:08:56.781 --> 01:09:00.948
this policy of-of raising prices
on certain items


1587
01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:04.573
in areas where they, uh,
didn't have any, any competition.


1588
01:09:06.031 --> 01:09:09.031
Mostly, this turned out to be, um,

1589
01:09:09.115 --> 01:09:14.156
poor areas,
where there was a lot of-of poverty.


1590
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.031
Could you give us an example
of this type of selective pricing?


1591
01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:23.365
There was this one, uh,
casket in particular I remember.


1592
01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:26.406
The, um, the Wilbert Copper Trubune.

1593
01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:31.865
It, uh, was supposed to retail for $750.

1594
01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:35.115
Uh, which it did in-in some places,

1595
01:09:35.198 --> 01:09:37.031
like, say, Madison.

1596
01:09:37.115 --> 01:09:40.781
Uh, but then in other places,
like Corinth,


1597
01:09:40.865 --> 01:09:43.531
which, as you know, is-is very poor...

1598
01:09:43.615 --> 01:09:44.823
Yes, of course.

1599
01:09:44.906 --> 01:09:48.406
Over there, they hiked the price up
to something crazy.


1600
01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:51.531
Like three times
what it was supposed to cost.


1601
01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.740
Just because they could.

1602
01:09:54.948 --> 01:09:57.490
They knew customers didn't have
anywhere else to go.


1603
01:09:57.573 --> 01:09:59.490
So, basically,

1604
01:09:59.573 --> 01:10:02.490
if I understand you,

1605
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:07.115
the Loewen Group was involved in
a form of selective price gouging.


1606
01:10:07.198 --> 01:10:08.573
Of what?

1607
01:10:08.656 --> 01:10:11.531
Objection. Your Honor,
how could the witness possibly know


1608
01:10:11.615 --> 01:10:13.823
the intentions of people
she's never even met before?


1609
01:10:13.906 --> 01:10:15.281
Sustained.

1610
01:10:15.365 --> 01:10:16.615
All right, then.

1611
01:10:16.698 --> 01:10:18.281
Let me ask you this.

1612
01:10:18.365 --> 01:10:21.490
In your time at Durbin and Sons,
were you ever left


1613
01:10:21.573 --> 01:10:24.031
with the impression that the Loewen Group

1614
01:10:24.115 --> 01:10:26.740
might have been specifically targeting

1615
01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.216
- minority communities...
- Objection.


1616
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.781
- Your Honor.
- Wow! Really?


1617
01:10:29.865 --> 01:10:31.948
- My God.
- Speculation.


1618
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:35.490
Mr. Allred, what is the basis
for this line of questioning?


1619
01:10:35.573 --> 01:10:37.531
Mr. Allred?

1620
01:10:37.615 --> 01:10:39.531
You know what?

1621
01:10:39.615 --> 01:10:41.031
I apologize.

1622
01:10:41.115 --> 01:10:44.740
No basis. It was just speculation, is all.

1623
01:10:44.823 --> 01:10:47.406
Please, consider it stricken.

1624
01:10:48.781 --> 01:10:51.823
But Your Honor, I do take exception
to Ms. Downes' tone.


1625
01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:53.990
- You've got to be kidding.
- My tone?


1626
01:10:54.073 --> 01:10:55.906
- Noted.
- Her tone.


1627
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.591
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Mrs. McGrath.


1628
01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:59.115
No further questions.

1629
01:10:59.198 --> 01:11:01.406
It was noted, all right.

1630
01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.740
Morning, Jerry.

1631
01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:20.698
Willie, how are you?

1632
01:11:23.365 --> 01:11:25.198
I guess you're still mad at me, huh?

1633
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.281
It was a very bad day.
Why don't we just leave it at that?


1634
01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:32.823
All right, here we go.

1635
01:11:32.906 --> 01:11:34.615
Look, I
-I messed up in there.

1636
01:11:34.698 --> 01:11:37.365
Okay? I-I did the wrong thing
and I, and I blew it


1637
01:11:37.448 --> 01:11:40.406
and, uh, I just want to say I'm sorry,
and I...


1638
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.198
I apologize.

1639
01:11:42.281 --> 01:11:43.990
Very well.

1640
01:11:44.073 --> 01:11:46.073
Apology accepted.

1641
01:11:49.948 --> 01:11:51.656
Good. We got that over.

1642
01:11:53.656 --> 01:11:56.656
Is this the first time
you ever apologized to somebody like that?


1643
01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.615
Mm.

1644
01:11:58.698 --> 01:12:01.073
Huh. Be honest with you, my wife, uh,

1645
01:12:01.156 --> 01:12:03.198
- she helped me with the phrasing.
- Mm-hmm.


1646
01:12:05.448 --> 01:12:08.531
Well, she did a very nice job.
I want you to thank her for me.


1647
01:12:08.615 --> 01:12:10.156
All right.

1648
01:12:19.865 --> 01:12:22.490
And you know what I can't stand
about that man?


1649
01:12:22.573 --> 01:12:23.573
What?

1650
01:12:27.156 --> 01:12:29.031
His face.

1651
01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:35.365
I know what you mean. It's, uh...

1652
01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:36.674
You know what I'm talking about.

1653
01:12:36.698 --> 01:12:38.031
...in the expression.

1654
01:12:38.115 --> 01:12:39.365
- Mm-hmm.
- No,


1655
01:12:39.448 --> 01:12:42.198
it's generation upon generation
of white entitlement


1656
01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:45.948
<i>and privilege all encapsulated
in one, single,</i>


1657
01:12:46.031 --> 01:12:47.573
simpering grin.

1658
01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:50.990
But him with that woman on stand today,

1659
01:12:51.073 --> 01:12:53.115
posturing and pretending like

1660
01:12:53.198 --> 01:12:55.990
he's some sort of
savior for our people... Ooh!


1661
01:12:56.073 --> 01:12:58.156
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

1662
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.323
the jury did seem to eat it up.

1663
01:13:02.531 --> 01:13:05.573
Yeah. That is a problem, isn't it?

1664
01:13:12.906 --> 01:13:15.198
Didn't I see his name

1665
01:13:15.281 --> 01:13:17.698
on the witness list at some point?

1666
01:13:17.781 --> 01:13:20.740
Supposedly, Gary was planning on

1667
01:13:20.823 --> 01:13:22.698
calling him a...

1668
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.115
Calling him as a material witness to
the agreement between O'Keefe and Loewen.


1669
01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:34.656
Which means I will have him on cross.

1670
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.865
Which means
you're gonna have him on cross.


1671
01:13:56.406 --> 01:13:59.115
Hey, have any of you guys
read about this deal


1672
01:13:59.198 --> 01:14:01.531
that the Loewen Group made
with something called


1673
01:14:01.615 --> 01:14:03.615
the "National Baptist Convention"?

1674
01:14:03.698 --> 01:14:05.698
The National Baptist Convention?

1675
01:14:05.781 --> 01:14:07.740
What... What is that?

1676
01:14:07.823 --> 01:14:10.365
It's like, um, you know, like...

1677
01:14:10.448 --> 01:14:11.948
an arm of the Black church.

1678
01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.781
But a really big one.

1679
01:14:13.865 --> 01:14:15.990
Probably the biggest, actually.

1680
01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:17.656
Sorry, did you... did you just say

1681
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.406
that the Loewen Group has a deal
with the Black church?


1682
01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:24.156
The, uh, National Baptist Convention.
But yeah.


1683
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.156
Yeah, how? How does that make any sense?

1684
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.781
I don't know.

1685
01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.740
But it's all right here.

1686
01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.906
Apparently, they created
some sort of partnership


1687
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:36.698
about a year ago.

1688
01:14:36.781 --> 01:14:38.615
Hard to say why, though.

1689
01:14:42.448 --> 01:14:44.823
Okay, can you get me
some more information about this?


1690
01:14:45.823 --> 01:14:47.115
Yes, sir.

1691
01:14:47.198 --> 01:14:49.865
Are the plaintiffs ready
to call their next witness?


1692
01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:53.031
Yes.
Actually, Your Honor, we'd like to call


1693
01:14:53.115 --> 01:14:56.615
Mr. O'Keefe's longtime attorney,
Michael Allred, to the stand.


1694
01:14:56.698 --> 01:14:58.031
Your Honor.

1695
01:14:58.115 --> 01:15:00.448
Seriously?

1696
01:15:00.531 --> 01:15:02.656
Where are you going with this,
Mr. Douglas?


1697
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.531
Your Honor, we-we recognize
how this might seem a little unusual.


1698
01:15:05.615 --> 01:15:09.031
However, Mr. Allred was with Mr. O'Keefe,

1699
01:15:09.115 --> 01:15:12.073
as his attorney, the entire time
he was dealing with Loewen.


1700
01:15:12.156 --> 01:15:14.490
And, uh, we feel like his-his testimony
will be essential.


1701
01:15:19.573 --> 01:15:21.823
Michael Allred.

1702
01:15:21.906 --> 01:15:24.031
Oh, hell, we friends. 
I'm-a call you Mike.

1703
01:15:24.115 --> 01:15:26.156
You bet, Reggie.

1704
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.198
So, Mike,

1705
01:15:28.281 --> 01:15:31.281
in your 30 years of practicing law,

1706
01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:34.031
specializing in contract law,

1707
01:15:34.115 --> 01:15:37.365
did it ever occur to you,
when you were drawing up the contract


1708
01:15:37.448 --> 01:15:40.573
between Mr. O'Keefe and Mr. Loewen,
that there could be


1709
01:15:40.656 --> 01:15:44.240
any kind of misunderstanding as to what
that document actually was?


1710
01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:45.698
No, sir.

1711
01:15:45.781 --> 01:15:48.365
It was extremely clear to everyone
exactly what it was.


1712
01:15:48.448 --> 01:15:49.906
It was a contract.

1713
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:52.115
Contract. It's a contract.

1714
01:15:52.198 --> 01:15:54.698
Now, was there anything that suggested,
in the language,


1715
01:15:54.781 --> 01:15:57.406
that the, uh,
agreed-upon time for the deal to close


1716
01:15:57.490 --> 01:15:59.906
would be... open-ended?

1717
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:02.865
How's it feel to
be sitting in that chair?

1718
01:16:04.656 --> 01:16:07.073
- It's a little uncomfortable, yeah.
- Mm.


1719
01:16:08.115 --> 01:16:11.906
Imagine, we haven't even
gotten started yet.


1720
01:16:14.906 --> 01:16:18.740
You've been Mr. O'Keefe's attorney
quite some time now, yes?


1721
01:16:18.823 --> 01:16:20.323
I have.

1722
01:16:20.406 --> 01:16:22.031
For 30 years... nearly 30 years.

1723
01:16:22.115 --> 01:16:23.240
Mm.

1724
01:16:23.323 --> 01:16:25.483
And would you say you
and Mr. O'Keefe are good friends?


1725
01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:28.132
- Sure. He's one of my closest friends.
- Hmm.


1726
01:16:28.156 --> 01:16:30.281
Yeah, we share a lot in common.

1727
01:16:30.365 --> 01:16:32.073
I admire him.

1728
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:40.007
Mr. Allred, would you say
this is a case about race?


1729
01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:42.115
- Objection. Objection.
- Objection.


1730
01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:43.323
Overruled.

1731
01:16:44.406 --> 01:16:46.156
Would I say this
is a case about race?

1732
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.781
No, I would not say
this is a case about race.


1733
01:16:51.323 --> 01:16:52.948
Really?

1734
01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:58.781
Okay, well, the subject of race does seem
to keep coming up, doesn't it?


1735
01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.823
Almost exclusively from your side.

1736
01:17:00.906 --> 01:17:04.490
Uh, for instance,
this whole heroic narrative


1737
01:17:04.573 --> 01:17:08.823
about, uh, Mr. O'Keefe supposedly
having some sort of civil rights record


1738
01:17:08.906 --> 01:17:11.948
and denying the KKK a permit...

1739
01:17:12.031 --> 01:17:15.073
Uh, explain to me what relevance that has
to a case about contracts.


1740
01:17:15.156 --> 01:17:17.615
Uh, about Jerry's character.

1741
01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:19.115
It's more about his integrity

1742
01:17:19.198 --> 01:17:20.632
- and his decency.
- 'Cause he does


1743
01:17:20.656 --> 01:17:21.716
such great things for Black people, huh?

1744
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.674
- Object-Objection.
- Objection, Your Honor.


1745
01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:24.924
- Stand up.
- Objection. I'm not standing up.


1746
01:17:24.948 --> 01:17:26.049
- I said "objection."
- I will not allow


1747
01:17:26.073 --> 01:17:27.341
this line of questioning, Ms. Downes.

1748
01:17:27.365 --> 01:17:28.424
- Sustained.
- I'm-I'm objecting.


1749
01:17:28.448 --> 01:17:31.448
Another thing that has been
made quite clear in this case is


1750
01:17:31.531 --> 01:17:34.448
how important family, family legacy,

1751
01:17:34.531 --> 01:17:36.281
is to Mr. O'Keefe.

1752
01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:38.073
Is that something you share?

1753
01:17:38.156 --> 01:17:39.865
Family important to you as well?

1754
01:17:39.948 --> 01:17:42.615
Well, it's not just important to me,
it's everything to me.


1755
01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:45.382
It's everything. Well, that's something
you and Mr. O'Keefe have in common.


1756
01:17:45.406 --> 01:17:46.507
- Objection.
- Objection, Your Honor.


1757
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.132
Because you're best friends, yeah?

1758
01:17:48.156 --> 01:17:50.132
Overruled.
The witness can answer the question,


1759
01:17:50.156 --> 01:17:51.466
but let's try and get to the point.

1760
01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:53.698
Absolutely, it's something
that we share in common.


1761
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:55.924
I-Is this really what you want
to be asking me, Ms. Downes?


1762
01:17:55.948 --> 01:17:57.573
It is.

1763
01:17:57.656 --> 01:17:58.781
Actually.

1764
01:17:58.865 --> 01:18:00.115
But thank you.

1765
01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:02.573
You love your family.

1766
01:18:02.656 --> 01:18:03.698
Yeah?

1767
01:18:03.781 --> 01:18:06.406
Your extended family,
your immediate family...


1768
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:08.156
you love all of your family, yes?

1769
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.448
Every member of my family.

1770
01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:10.531
Yeah?

1771
01:18:11.573 --> 01:18:16.073
So, there-there's no one
that you secretly wish you could disown?


1772
01:18:16.156 --> 01:18:17.424
- Someone that you're maybe
- Objection, Your Honor.


1773
01:18:17.448 --> 01:18:18.841
- a little ashamed...
- It doesn't matter what he feels.


1774
01:18:18.865 --> 01:18:20.091
- Disown?
- She doesn't know what...


1775
01:18:20.115 --> 01:18:22.049
'Cause I know I have some family members
I would love to disown.


1776
01:18:22.073 --> 01:18:23.591
- But you don't.
- I'm-a take care of this.


1777
01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:24.674
- No.
- No? You don't.


1778
01:18:24.698 --> 01:18:25.823
No.

1779
01:18:25.906 --> 01:18:27.823
Say, for instance, your grandfather.

1780
01:18:27.906 --> 01:18:29.865
- My grandfather.
- Yes.


1781
01:18:29.948 --> 01:18:31.615
Your grandfather.

1782
01:18:37.823 --> 01:18:41.073
He was my grandfather.
What does that have to do with this case?


1783
01:18:45.656 --> 01:18:47.281
Remind me:

1784
01:18:47.365 --> 01:18:50.198
how long was your grandfather
a member of the Ku Klux Klan?


1785
01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.091
- Objection. Objection.
- Objection. Objection.


1786
01:18:56.115 --> 01:18:57.216
Objection.

1787
01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.716
- We gonna stop this right now.
- Your Honor, I am gonna continue


1788
01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.924
- to say "objection."
- This is wrong.


1789
01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:01.007
Objection.

1790
01:19:01.031 --> 01:19:02.490
Objection. Objection.

1791
01:19:02.573 --> 01:19:04.632
Did you bond with your grandfather

1792
01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.406
about the KKK?

1793
01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:07.549
- Did you share some bond?
- What is the question?


1794
01:19:07.573 --> 01:19:09.424
- What is the question?
- Did you share some love


1795
01:19:09.448 --> 01:19:11.156
about the burning cross?

1796
01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.448
You go to any, uh, KKK rallies
with your grandfather,


1797
01:19:14.531 --> 01:19:15.799
- Mr. Allred?
- Now, you know


1798
01:19:15.823 --> 01:19:17.924
this is out of line,
it has nothing to do with this case.


1799
01:19:17.948 --> 01:19:19.073
Objection.

1800
01:19:19.156 --> 01:19:20.299
- Overruled, Mr. Gary.
- How can you overrule that?


1801
01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:21.424
Answer the question, Mr. Allred.

1802
01:19:21.448 --> 01:19:23.382
With all due respect, Your Honor,
this has nothing to do with the case.


1803
01:19:23.406 --> 01:19:25.240
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?


1804
01:19:25.323 --> 01:19:28.740
Are you asking me was I aware that my
grandfather was once a member of the KKK?


1805
01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:31.031
Mike, you don't have
to answer that question.


1806
01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:32.406
Objection.

1807
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:34.448
I heard you the first time, Mr. Gary.

1808
01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:35.990
Yes, I was asking that question.

1809
01:19:36.073 --> 01:19:37.341
I am no longer asking that question.

1810
01:19:37.365 --> 01:19:38.948
No further questions.

1811
01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:41.549
- What his grandfather has done...
- You know, lawyer to lawyer,


1812
01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:43.293
that was completely out of line,
Ms. Downes.


1813
01:19:43.365 --> 01:19:44.948
Oh, the hypocrisy.

1814
01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:46.448
The hypocrisy.

1815
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:49.281
It's quite outrageous, Your Honor.

1816
01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:52.281
Room full of brothers right now.

1817
01:19:52.365 --> 01:19:53.799
- Denounce your granddaddy.
- Yeah.


1818
01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:56.198
Say it, Mike. Say it.

1819
01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:58.156
Go on. It's easy.

1820
01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.716
- Come on, Mike. Denounce him.
- Yeah.


1821
01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.073
You know what?

1822
01:20:01.156 --> 01:20:02.365
I'm sorry.

1823
01:20:02.448 --> 01:20:03.740
All right?

1824
01:20:03.823 --> 01:20:05.115
I'm sorry.

1825
01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:06.573
Her behavior was unconscionable.

1826
01:20:06.656 --> 01:20:08.281
You cannot hold someone responsible

1827
01:20:08.365 --> 01:20:10.365
for the mistakes of their ancestors.

1828
01:20:10.448 --> 01:20:14.073
Mike, your granddaddy is a racist,

1829
01:20:14.156 --> 01:20:16.656
land-stealing, slave-raping

1830
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.341
- piece of shit.
- Oh, come on now, Reggie Douglas, that's not right!


1831
01:20:19.365 --> 01:20:20.841
That's not right.
He's still my granddaddy.


1832
01:20:20.865 --> 01:20:21.924
- I wouldn't say that about...
- Don't you bring...


1833
01:20:21.948 --> 01:20:23.299
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Don't you bring up on me!


1834
01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:24.799
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Stop all this.


1835
01:20:24.823 --> 01:20:26.656
Stop it right now. Stop it.

1836
01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.573
Reg, you stop. All of y'all.

1837
01:20:30.656 --> 01:20:33.656
Mike, we not fixin' to crucify you...

1838
01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.615
about what happened in the past.

1839
01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:37.948
He can't fix his grandfather
or anything else.


1840
01:20:38.031 --> 01:20:39.906
But you know what we can fix?

1841
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:41.198
This case.

1842
01:20:41.281 --> 01:20:42.615
Hold on.

1843
01:20:42.698 --> 01:20:43.781
Hold on, man.

1844
01:20:43.865 --> 01:20:46.031
So you-you fixin' to give him a pass?

1845
01:20:46.115 --> 01:20:47.466
- That was this is?
- I'm-a give him a pass


1846
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:49.091
because you didn't know enough
about his past


1847
01:20:49.115 --> 01:20:50.698
and that's why you got your ass kicked.

1848
01:20:52.698 --> 01:20:54.341
- Fuck this case, man.
- I think we can win.


1849
01:20:54.365 --> 01:20:56.781
No, man, I'm going back to Florida. Nah.

1850
01:20:56.865 --> 01:20:58.257
- Doing exactly what we should've did in the beginning.
- Come on, man.


1851
01:20:58.281 --> 01:21:00.365
I got a question for you, Reggie:

1852
01:21:00.448 --> 01:21:02.448
What's taking you so long
to get out the door?


1853
01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:03.781
Wow.

1854
01:21:03.865 --> 01:21:05.299
- Willie...
- You don't have to tell me twice.


1855
01:21:05.323 --> 01:21:06.823
Have fun with these white folks.

1856
01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:09.031
- Reg.
- Hey, Reggie.


1857
01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:10.281
Reg!

1858
01:21:11.948 --> 01:21:13.781
You want to go, too?

1859
01:21:13.865 --> 01:21:15.156
You know what?

1860
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.281
I'm out.

1861
01:21:17.365 --> 01:21:18.490
I'm tired of this shit.

1862
01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:19.781
I'm out, too.

1863
01:21:19.865 --> 01:21:21.531
I miss home, anyway.

1864
01:21:21.615 --> 01:21:24.031
Willie, I'm gettin' too old
for this shit, man.


1865
01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:27.240
Mike, I'm sorry.

1866
01:21:27.323 --> 01:21:29.615
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1867
01:21:29.698 --> 01:21:30.781
Me, too.

1868
01:21:34.198 --> 01:21:35.781
Can't have this.

1869
01:21:35.865 --> 01:21:37.281
Have what?

1870
01:21:37.365 --> 01:21:38.740
We got a case.

1871
01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.031
To win.

1872
01:21:48.156 --> 01:21:50.156
I should probably...

1873
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.132
- I should probably recuse myself.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.


1874
01:21:54.156 --> 01:21:55.632
- Mike, no, you can't do that.
- Yeah, I probably should.


1875
01:21:55.656 --> 01:21:57.091
- No, Mike, you can't do that.
- I should, shouldn't I?


1876
01:21:57.115 --> 01:21:58.466
Now, we got a long way to go,
but we can win this case.


1877
01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:00.823
If I even dare to step foot
in that courtroom again,


1878
01:22:00.906 --> 01:22:02.448
the jury's never gonna see me,

1879
01:22:02.531 --> 01:22:04.132
they're just gonna see
a guy with a sheet on his head.


1880
01:22:04.156 --> 01:22:05.356
Listen, listen. 
We dug a hole.

1881
01:22:05.406 --> 01:22:07.573
We dug a hole, but
we can dig out of it.

1882
01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:10.656
I'm sorry, Willie, I can't do it,
'cause we both know if I stay on,


1883
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.740
my presence is just gonna
hurt the case more,


1884
01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:15.240
and I can't do that to you
and I sure can't do that to Jerry.


1885
01:22:15.323 --> 01:22:17.073
Mm-hmm.

1886
01:22:22.531 --> 01:22:23.740
All right.

1887
01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.490
We'll have to win it without you.

1888
01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:27.865
You're gonna.

1889
01:22:29.198 --> 01:22:30.990
Halbert. Be good.

1890
01:22:51.365 --> 01:22:54.198
Well, there you are.
I've been looking for you.


1891
01:23:00.948 --> 01:23:03.781
This trial's not going
the way I wanted it to.


1892
01:23:05.198 --> 01:23:07.406
I feel like I made a bad mistake.

1893
01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:11.698
And I ought to be cutting my losses.

1894
01:23:13.281 --> 01:23:16.323
I thought justice was blind.

1895
01:23:16.406 --> 01:23:20.990
That I could hold Ray Loewen to his word
in a court of law.


1896
01:23:22.656 --> 01:23:26.448
Make him pay.
But hell, I was the one turned out blind.


1897
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:29.698
I am sorry for putting you
through all this.


1898
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:35.156
You don't need to say sorry, Jeremiah.

1899
01:23:36.573 --> 01:23:38.281
Not to me, anyway.

1900
01:23:40.156 --> 01:23:42.365
I know who you are.

1901
01:23:45.698 --> 01:23:48.531
- Have you told Willie yet?
- No.


1902
01:23:48.615 --> 01:23:51.698
I think he goes home to Florida
on the weekends.


1903
01:23:53.031 --> 01:23:55.615
Feel like I ought
to tell him in person.

1904
01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:57.948
I think that would be
the right thing to do.


1905
01:24:10.115 --> 01:24:11.948
Hey, sorry. Um...

1906
01:24:12.031 --> 01:24:14.615
- Wait, what's-what's in this one again?
- Um...


1907
01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:19.698
It's that info you requested on Loewen's
deal with the National Baptist Convention.


1908
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:23.115
Actually, would you mind leaving
that one here with me?


1909
01:24:25.365 --> 01:24:26.906
Really think it's over, boss?

1910
01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:31.740
I don't think there's any way
we can win this case,


1911
01:24:31.823 --> 01:24:35.365
and my guess is, Jerry's starting
to see it that way as well, so...


1912
01:25:08.656 --> 01:25:10.906
You-you must be Mrs. Gary.

1913
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:12.906
- Yes.
- I hope you'll forgive me


1914
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.823
for just showing up like this, but, uh,

1915
01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:16.615
I'm Jeremiah O'Keefe.

1916
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:18.865
Oh!

1917
01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.115
- You mean Jerry.
- Yes, ma'am.


1918
01:25:21.198 --> 01:25:24.740
The Jerry that my husband keeps
going on about!


1919
01:25:24.823 --> 01:25:26.740
Uh, is Willie home, by the way?

1920
01:25:26.823 --> 01:25:28.823
Oh, no, I'm afraid he's not.

1921
01:25:28.906 --> 01:25:32.156
He's over at his mother's in Indiantown,
where he usually goes on Saturdays.


1922
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.406
Okay.

1923
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:35.323
Hey, I tell you what.
You give me a minute


1924
01:25:35.406 --> 01:25:37.198
to grab my car keys.

1925
01:25:37.281 --> 01:25:39.573
- I'll drive you there myself.
- Oh, no, please, no.


1926
01:25:39.656 --> 01:25:41.448
I
-I don't want to impose.

1927
01:25:43.615 --> 01:25:46.531
Jerry, absolutely not.

1928
01:25:46.615 --> 01:25:48.281
You family now.

1929
01:25:48.365 --> 01:25:49.698
Come on, now.

1930
01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:58.740
Just entering Indiantown now.

1931
01:25:58.823 --> 01:26:00.406
This where Willie's from?

1932
01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:02.490
Where we're both from.

1933
01:26:11.365 --> 01:26:13.656
Willie and I have had our differences.

1934
01:26:16.031 --> 01:26:18.615
I want you to know
I think he's a remarkable man.


1935
01:26:24.073 --> 01:26:26.031
- ...upside-down on a ledge.
- Right. Exactly.


1936
01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:29.281
No.

1937
01:26:29.365 --> 01:26:30.906
I'm a mess.

1938
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:33.948
Know what I'm saying?
Everybody's going to Dallas.


1939
01:26:34.031 --> 01:26:36.031
Ah...

1940
01:26:37.115 --> 01:26:39.531
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my goodness.


1941
01:26:39.615 --> 01:26:40.698
Hmm.

1942
01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:45.323
Willie ever tell you
he's one of 11 siblings?


1943
01:26:47.615 --> 01:26:49.073
Mm-hmm.

1944
01:26:49.156 --> 01:26:50.531
- Surely.
- Number six out of 11.


1945
01:26:50.615 --> 01:26:54.823
Well, believe it or not,
I have 13 children of my own.


1946
01:26:54.906 --> 01:26:56.365
- Oh, my God.
- Do you now?


1947
01:26:56.448 --> 01:26:58.531
I do.

1948
01:26:58.615 --> 01:26:59.990
I say.

1949
01:27:00.073 --> 01:27:01.948
Ooh.

1950
01:27:02.031 --> 01:27:03.823
Y'all have 26 kids between you.

1951
01:27:03.906 --> 01:27:05.698
Well, then you know,

1952
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:07.781
there's always that one baby

1953
01:27:07.865 --> 01:27:10.448
that, no matter what you do,

1954
01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:12.906
is always clinging to you for dear life.

1955
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:15.656
Wrapped around the bottom of your leg,

1956
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.323
and can't let go.

1957
01:27:17.406 --> 01:27:18.990
Oh, man.

1958
01:27:20.573 --> 01:27:22.365
That's my Willie.

1959
01:27:22.448 --> 01:27:26.073
And look at where all that longing

1960
01:27:26.156 --> 01:27:28.323
and desperation for love

1961
01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:30.573
has gotten him now.

1962
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:43.073
My grandfather was a sharecropper.

1963
01:27:43.156 --> 01:27:44.490
Uh-huh.

1964
01:27:44.573 --> 01:27:46.156
My paternal grandfather.

1965
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.240
- Mm-hmm.
- My namesake.


1966
01:27:50.323 --> 01:27:52.906
I was eight years old,

1967
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:55.448
out there in them sugarcane fields,
you know?


1968
01:27:56.906 --> 01:27:58.448
Working.

1969
01:27:58.531 --> 01:27:59.823
Me.

1970
01:28:02.406 --> 01:28:04.382
4:30 in the morning, she'd wake me up,
man, get me out here.


1971
01:28:04.406 --> 01:28:05.591
I wasn't no taller than this grass, man.

1972
01:28:05.615 --> 01:28:07.841
That's how it all got started,
out there in the sugarcane.


1973
01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:10.466
Reason I came all the way
out here, Willie, is 'cause I...


1974
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:12.406
Look, listen, listen, listen, listen.

1975
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:14.115
'Fore you even get there. I know.

1976
01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:17.448
You want to drop the case.

1977
01:28:18.656 --> 01:28:20.531
I know it's got to be a disappointment.

1978
01:28:20.615 --> 01:28:22.615
But if there was
any way that I thought...

1979
01:28:22.698 --> 01:28:24.198
Look, look, listen, listen, Jerry.

1980
01:28:24.281 --> 01:28:26.448
You-you... you don't understand, doc.

1981
01:28:26.531 --> 01:28:28.531
Look...

1982
01:28:28.615 --> 01:28:30.823
Now, I know you got to do
what you got to do.


1983
01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:32.906
But at the same time,

1984
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.615
you just got to know that I know,

1985
01:28:34.698 --> 01:28:38.073
down deep in my heart, that me and you
together, we could've did it.


1986
01:28:38.156 --> 01:28:40.656
We could've took that company down, man.

1987
01:28:41.865 --> 01:28:44.865
I just hope you know
how much I've enjoyed getting to know you.


1988
01:28:44.948 --> 01:28:46.865
This one didn't roll our way.

1989
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:52.490
But getting to know you...

1990
01:28:52.573 --> 01:28:54.615
was a... highlight.

1991
01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:57.281
What
-What's that noise?

1992
01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:01.115
Listen...

1993
01:29:01.198 --> 01:29:02.698
Man...

1994
01:29:02.781 --> 01:29:04.365
Hold on a second.

1995
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:06.490
Hey.

1996
01:29:06.573 --> 01:29:07.716
Hello? Hey.

1997
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.823
Hal?

1998
01:29:08.906 --> 01:29:11.406
- Hello? Can you hear...
- Hal, I can barely hear you.


1999
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:13.281
Hey, are-are you with Jerry right now?

2000
01:29:13.365 --> 01:29:14.531
Yeah. Yeah.

2001
01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:15.674
- Good. Yes. Okay.
- Yes, I am.


2002
01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:16.841
Do not let him drop the case.

2003
01:29:16.865 --> 01:29:18.781
Hello?

2004
01:29:18.865 --> 01:29:20.031
Hal, can you hear me?

2005
01:29:20.115 --> 01:29:23.906
- It's a bad connection.
- I said, do not let him drop the case.


2006
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.573
Just-just trust me, okay?

2007
01:29:25.656 --> 01:29:27.740
I... I may have found something.

2008
01:29:27.823 --> 01:29:30.031
Okay. Good, I'll call you.

2009
01:29:43.198 --> 01:29:45.865
<i>Thank you all for taking the time</i>

2010
01:29:45.948 --> 01:29:48.031
to speak with us, Mr. Soames.

2011
01:29:48.115 --> 01:29:49.698
Everyone.

2012
01:29:49.781 --> 01:29:51.656
What can you tell us about the deal

2013
01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.198
that the Loewen Group made with
the National Baptist Convention?


2014
01:29:55.281 --> 01:29:57.823
Well, nothing good ever come out of it.

2015
01:29:57.906 --> 01:30:00.531
At least not for Black folks.
That's the truth.


2016
01:30:00.615 --> 01:30:02.656
'Bout a year back,

2017
01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:06.573
the Loewen Group connected with
some of the top leadership


2018
01:30:06.656 --> 01:30:08.073
of the NBC.

2019
01:30:08.156 --> 01:30:10.573
- National Baptist Convention?
- Yes, sir.


2020
01:30:10.656 --> 01:30:15.240
One of the largest single branches
of the Black church.


2021
01:30:15.323 --> 01:30:18.448
They represent over 33,000 churches

2022
01:30:18.531 --> 01:30:20.740
and more than eight million members.

2023
01:30:20.823 --> 01:30:25.115
Anyway, they made a proposal to the NBC,

2024
01:30:25.198 --> 01:30:28.615
told 'em that
if they could convince the Black church


2025
01:30:28.698 --> 01:30:33.990
to endorse the Loewen Group
as their death care provider of choice,


2026
01:30:34.073 --> 01:30:37.156
then they'd turn some of its members
into salesmen.


2027
01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.781
Like, uh, teach 'em how to sell everything

2028
01:30:39.865 --> 01:30:42.948
from graves to crypts to headstones

2029
01:30:43.031 --> 01:30:46.823
and, uh, burial insurance
straight to their own people.


2030
01:30:46.906 --> 01:30:48.656
And for every product they sold,

2031
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.240
- they could keep the commission.
- Hmm.


2032
01:30:51.323 --> 01:30:53.948
Wait a minute now, so the Loewen Group

2033
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:57.115
was taking poor Black people,
having them sell their funeral products


2034
01:30:57.198 --> 01:30:59.865
to other poor Black people
for a commission.


2035
01:30:59.948 --> 01:31:03.073
Course, they said it was all win-win.

2036
01:31:03.156 --> 01:31:05.615
Help people out of poverty,

2037
01:31:05.698 --> 01:31:07.865
boost economic empowerment.

2038
01:31:07.948 --> 01:31:10.240
But it never did much for anybody.

2039
01:31:10.323 --> 01:31:12.198
Except the Loewen Group, of course.

2040
01:31:12.281 --> 01:31:13.365
Yeah.

2041
01:31:13.448 --> 01:31:14.882
They was just trying to find another way

2042
01:31:14.906 --> 01:31:16.573
to exploit Black folks

2043
01:31:16.656 --> 01:31:18.948
in their most vulnerable moments.

2044
01:31:41.865 --> 01:31:44.031
You know what this right here is?

2045
01:31:45.531 --> 01:31:47.156
Not sure.

2046
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.906
What it is, is a cemetery.

2047
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:52.698
Now, you can't tell from looking at it

2048
01:31:52.781 --> 01:31:55.823
on account of the fact that
there's no headstones.


2049
01:31:55.906 --> 01:31:57.740
Why's that?

2050
01:31:57.823 --> 01:32:01.031
That's 'cause
it's a different kind of cemetery.


2051
01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:04.490
It's an old slave burial ground.

2052
01:32:04.573 --> 01:32:07.740
Everybody knows slaves didn't have
no money of their own


2053
01:32:07.823 --> 01:32:11.031
to ever bury their loved ones
with a headstone.


2054
01:32:12.073 --> 01:32:14.531
Though you can't really tell
by looking at it...


2055
01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:18.615
...our entire history,

2056
01:32:18.698 --> 01:32:22.073
history of Black people in the South,

2057
01:32:22.156 --> 01:32:24.698
history of Black people in America...

2058
01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.906
...of our slave ancestors, it's,

2059
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:31.198
it's all buried everywhere out here.

2060
01:32:31.281 --> 01:32:33.365
Deep underground.

2061
01:32:33.448 --> 01:32:37.156
Pretty much everywhere you look,
that's where our history is.


2062
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.448
In these vast, empty fields.

2063
01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:46.240
In some places,
they put up all these statues.


2064
01:32:46.323 --> 01:32:49.406
You know,
like all these Confederate monuments


2065
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.490
and statues you see everywhere.

2066
01:32:53.281 --> 01:32:58.323
All the lot of 'em is put up right on top
of a slave burial field.


2067
01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.448
Mm-hmm.

2068
01:33:00.906 --> 01:33:04.115
It's like taking one history

2069
01:33:04.198 --> 01:33:06.573
and putting it right on top of another.

2070
01:33:07.823 --> 01:33:10.823
It's like taking one man's legacy,

2071
01:33:10.906 --> 01:33:13.323
putting it on top of another.

2072
01:33:13.406 --> 01:33:18.615
Till, one day, it
gets pushed down so deep

2073
01:33:18.698 --> 01:33:21.531
buried so deep...

2074
01:33:23.281 --> 01:33:25.656
...can't no one ever find it no more.

2075
01:33:36.156 --> 01:33:37.781
<i>Some of the members came to me</i>

2076
01:33:37.865 --> 01:33:39.573
<i>and told me that</i>

2077
01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:41.698
the actual cost of burying my father

2078
01:33:41.781 --> 01:33:45.448
was gonna be much more than
what they said when I bought the policy.


2079
01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:50.156
When I told them
that I didn't have the extra money,


2080
01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.490
and I didn't know how long
it would take me to get it,


2081
01:33:54.573 --> 01:33:59.031
they happily said
they'd keep the body on ice.


2082
01:33:59.115 --> 01:34:00.948
Rather than give me any comfort,

2083
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:02.740
the deacon assigned to be counselor

2084
01:34:02.823 --> 01:34:06.781
used it as an opportunity to shove
a bunch of brochures in my face


2085
01:34:06.865 --> 01:34:09.490
and try and recruit me
as a Loewen sales rep.


2086
01:34:09.573 --> 01:34:11.656
Then, suddenly,
this man from the NBC shows up,


2087
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:14.740
asking if I've made
funeral arrangements and...


2088
01:34:14.823 --> 01:34:17.490
if I'd be interested
in a Loewen burial package.


2089
01:34:18.865 --> 01:34:22.698
He said I'd get a much better deal
if I paid upfront.


2090
01:34:22.781 --> 01:34:24.656
Before my son died.

2091
01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.490
Once my husband finally passed,

2092
01:34:27.573 --> 01:34:30.573
that's when they said
that the package that I bought


2093
01:34:30.656 --> 01:34:34.698
didn't cover the cost of embalming
or moving the body.


2094
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:36.406
The coffin I bought for my mom

2095
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:38.573
was the least expensive one.

2096
01:34:39.823 --> 01:34:42.115
Come to find out

2097
01:34:42.198 --> 01:34:45.073
the one they sold me was
three times more than average.


2098
01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:50.531
Your own preacher come to you,
telling you you need something,


2099
01:34:50.615 --> 01:34:53.115
and you religious, you believe it.

2100
01:34:55.906 --> 01:34:57.490
Now, I understand that you are

2101
01:34:57.573 --> 01:34:59.906
one of the analysts for the Loewen Group.

2102
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.990
You deal with
some of the high-level deals.


2103
01:35:02.073 --> 01:35:03.698
Is that correct?

2104
01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:05.257
- Yes, that's correct.
- Mm-hmm.


2105
01:35:05.281 --> 01:35:07.656
Also that you were, uh,

2106
01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.380
one of the architects of this latest deal

2107
01:35:09.448 --> 01:35:11.323
that you had between the Loewen Group

2108
01:35:11.406 --> 01:35:13.240
and the National Baptist Convention.

2109
01:35:13.323 --> 01:35:15.240
- Is that right?
- Yes, I was.


2110
01:35:15.323 --> 01:35:17.156
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Baptist?

2111
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.948
- No, not Baptist.
- No.


2112
01:35:19.031 --> 01:35:20.299
- Christian, though, right?
- Yes.


2113
01:35:20.323 --> 01:35:21.781
Yeah, yeah. We all Christian, right?

2114
01:35:21.865 --> 01:35:23.240
We all believe in God. Amen?

2115
01:35:23.323 --> 01:35:24.615
Amen.

2116
01:35:26.323 --> 01:35:28.198
Here's the question, though.

2117
01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:32.156
How much money did the Loewen Group

2118
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.031
project to make from this deal

2119
01:35:36.115 --> 01:35:38.698
of them and the NBC?

2120
01:35:38.781 --> 01:35:41.281
And remember...

2121
01:35:41.365 --> 01:35:43.073
you're under oath.

2122
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:49.531
Uh, our original long-term projections
for that deal were somewhere around


2123
01:35:49.615 --> 01:35:52.156
1... maybe $1.2 billion.

2124
01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.656
$1.2 million?

2125
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.323
- $1.2 billion.
- $1.2...


2126
01:35:56.406 --> 01:35:58.156
$1.2 billion?

2127
01:35:59.823 --> 01:36:01.490
$1.2 billion, that's-that's good money.

2128
01:36:01.573 --> 01:36:03.698
That's good money
for the Loewen Group, correct?


2129
01:36:03.781 --> 01:36:05.031
- Yes.
- That's good money.


2130
01:36:05.115 --> 01:36:07.865
That's good money. $1.2 billion.

2131
01:36:07.948 --> 01:36:11.156
I thought you said "million,"
but you said "billion dollars."


2132
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.240
Uh...

2133
01:36:13.323 --> 01:36:15.156
How much did you pay 'em?

2134
01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.948
I'm sorry?

2135
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:20.531
I said, how much did you pay 'em?

2136
01:36:20.615 --> 01:36:23.365
How much did the Loewen Group

2137
01:36:23.448 --> 01:36:25.656
pay the National Baptist Convention

2138
01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:28.323
as compensation as a result of the deal?

2139
01:36:31.865 --> 01:36:36.198
I believe we made
about a $200,000 donation.


2140
01:36:40.365 --> 01:36:41.906
The jury heard it.

2141
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:44.198
We didn't have a defense for it.

2142
01:36:44.281 --> 01:36:46.865
Oh, what a fucking mess.

2143
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:51.531
I'm gonna have to call Loewen.

2144
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:22.490
<i>Dealing with people honestly</i>

2145
01:37:22.573 --> 01:37:25.531
is something that's always been
important to us.


2146
01:37:25.615 --> 01:37:28.990
Do we seek to be tough competitors

2147
01:37:29.073 --> 01:37:30.573
in an increasingly volatile market?

2148
01:37:30.656 --> 01:37:31.865
Yes.

2149
01:37:31.948 --> 01:37:33.781
But we don't cheat people.

2150
01:37:35.073 --> 01:37:37.073
- That's not how we operate.
- Mm.


2151
01:37:37.156 --> 01:37:38.740
No further questions, Your Honor.

2152
01:37:38.823 --> 01:37:41.698
- Your witness, Mr. Gary.
- All right.


2153
01:37:44.365 --> 01:37:45.531
Mr. Loewen, how you doing?

2154
01:37:45.615 --> 01:37:47.841
- I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Gary.
- You look good in that suit, doc.


2155
01:37:47.865 --> 01:37:49.174
That's that Armani, 
I can tell that

2156
01:37:49.198 --> 01:37:50.238
a mile away.

2157
01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:53.073
Listen, I just want to thank you
for coming down here.


2158
01:37:53.156 --> 01:37:55.031
I know you're really busy,

2159
01:37:55.115 --> 01:37:57.007
and we appreciate it,
but it's good to have the big man here.


2160
01:37:57.031 --> 01:38:01.406
Because, um, you know, we want to shine
some light on some of these dark places.


2161
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:03.170
And, uh,
I'll just start right off with it.


2162
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.948
I want to know, from your perspective...

2163
01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:10.490
...what was the deal that you had
between you and Mr. O'Keefe?


2164
01:38:10.573 --> 01:38:15.406
I believe it was roughly a year ago

2165
01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:17.948
when we received an enquiry

2166
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:21.365
from a representative of Mr. O'Keefe's.

2167
01:38:21.448 --> 01:38:23.865
In fact,

2168
01:38:23.948 --> 01:38:28.240
I'm pretty sure it was his lawyer,
Mr. Allred, who contacted us.


2169
01:38:28.323 --> 01:38:30.656
My understanding is

2170
01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.156
they were very anxious to sell.

2171
01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.281
So we started looking into the deal.

2172
01:38:36.365 --> 01:38:37.990
Sussing it out.

2173
01:38:38.073 --> 01:38:41.906
Trying to determine if it was something

2174
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:44.865
that would be a
good fit for our business.

2175
01:38:44.948 --> 01:38:49.156
Sometime after that,
I invited Mr. O'Keefe and his associates


2176
01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.865
up to Vancouver.

2177
01:38:50.948 --> 01:38:54.156
If I recall, they came for dinner,

2178
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.031
at my boat, and we discussed things.

2179
01:38:58.115 --> 01:39:01.781
After that, uh, hard to say.

2180
01:39:01.865 --> 01:39:05.698
Normally, at that stage, I turn things
over to my acquisitions team.


2181
01:39:07.281 --> 01:39:09.115
Well, that's pleasant.

2182
01:39:09.198 --> 01:39:10.948
I mean, that really is.

2183
01:39:11.031 --> 01:39:12.365
And...

2184
01:39:12.448 --> 01:39:13.698
...lucky for you,

2185
01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:17.240
uh, Mr. Loewen, I don't have
a lot of follow-up questions.


2186
01:39:17.323 --> 01:39:20.823
I just have, uh, one thing
I want to ask you. Uh...


2187
01:39:22.406 --> 01:39:23.781
What kind of boat?

2188
01:39:23.865 --> 01:39:25.781
Come again?

2189
01:39:25.865 --> 01:39:27.656
Oh, I said: "What kind of boat?"

2190
01:39:28.656 --> 01:39:31.240
You-you said earlier that you guys
were all on the boat together,


2191
01:39:31.323 --> 01:39:32.799
and y'all was eating
and having a good time,


2192
01:39:32.823 --> 01:39:34.490
having the best fish,

2193
01:39:34.573 --> 01:39:36.424
and I just wanted to know,
what kind of boat is it?


2194
01:39:36.448 --> 01:39:37.865
I don't understand.

2195
01:39:37.948 --> 01:39:40.490
Are you asking
about the particular make, or...


2196
01:39:42.115 --> 01:39:44.073
Matter of fact, 
I was asking...

2197
01:39:44.156 --> 01:39:48.406
Can I read from this?
It says, "Nine sunning decks."


2198
01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:50.740
Mm. "Six elegant staterooms."

2199
01:39:50.823 --> 01:39:52.156
- Uh...
- Objection, Your Honor.


2200
01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.299
- What is the relevance...
- "Five luxury guest cabins."


2201
01:39:53.323 --> 01:39:54.549
- ...of the witnesses' boat?
- Overruled.


2202
01:39:54.573 --> 01:39:55.632
Your Honor,
can I just read what the boat is?


2203
01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.091
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- It's a nice boat.


2204
01:39:57.115 --> 01:39:58.865
- Overruled.
- I just want to recognize


2205
01:39:58.948 --> 01:40:01.615
and let everybody see
that it's a very nice boat.


2206
01:40:01.698 --> 01:40:04.448
You got, uh, helicopter, helicopter pad.

2207
01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.615
You can land a helicopter

2208
01:40:05.698 --> 01:40:06.906
- on that thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.


2209
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:08.091
That's something else right there.

2210
01:40:08.115 --> 01:40:09.365
That's high grass.

2211
01:40:09.448 --> 01:40:12.531
How much did, uh,
how much did this boat of yours cost?


2212
01:40:14.823 --> 01:40:16.448
I really don't know.

2213
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:18.198
I think we're...

2214
01:40:18.281 --> 01:40:19.757
You're not understanding the question.

2215
01:40:19.781 --> 01:40:22.490
I'm... Let me frame it again
so you can understand it better.


2216
01:40:22.573 --> 01:40:24.323
I'm asking you

2217
01:40:24.406 --> 01:40:26.448
how much did you pay

2218
01:40:26.531 --> 01:40:28.573
for your boat?

2219
01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:30.948
I don't know.

2220
01:40:31.031 --> 01:40:32.091
- Objection. - RAY: I don't know.
- Can I ask...


2221
01:40:32.115 --> 01:40:33.966
- Asked and answered.
- You know what? Forget about that.


2222
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:35.073
Let me ask you this:

2223
01:40:35.156 --> 01:40:37.365
How much you pay for your plane? Huh?

2224
01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:39.466
Since you can remember some things
and you forget other things,


2225
01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:40.716
how much you pay for your plane?

2226
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.156
How much did you pay
for your plane, Mr. Gary?


2227
01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.448
I saw it on the runway.

2228
01:40:44.531 --> 01:40:45.573
Oh. You know what?

2229
01:40:45.656 --> 01:40:47.299
We could talk about how much
I paid for my plane,


2230
01:40:47.323 --> 01:40:48.865
'cause I know exactly how much it was,

2231
01:40:48.948 --> 01:40:50.424
but we not talking
about my plane right now.


2232
01:40:50.448 --> 01:40:52.031
We talking about your boat.

2233
01:40:52.115 --> 01:40:54.240
So, let me ask one more time,

2234
01:40:54.323 --> 01:40:56.363
so everybody can hear
and understand what I'm saying


2235
01:40:56.406 --> 01:40:58.490
to Mr. Loewen, the billionaire

2236
01:40:58.573 --> 01:41:00.906
who doesn't know the
price of his own boat

2237
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:03.073
that he had dinner on with his colleagues.

2238
01:41:03.156 --> 01:41:06.531
I want to ask you again:
how much did you pay


2239
01:41:06.615 --> 01:41:07.990
for your boat?

2240
01:41:09.406 --> 01:41:11.073
I don't know.

2241
01:41:13.073 --> 01:41:14.823
I think he's not hearing what I'm saying.

2242
01:41:14.906 --> 01:41:16.382
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
Mr. Loewen.


2243
01:41:16.406 --> 01:41:17.990
How much did your boat cost?

2244
01:41:20.156 --> 01:41:21.240
What is your point?

2245
01:41:21.323 --> 01:41:22.490
What's my point?

2246
01:41:22.573 --> 01:41:23.615
What is my point?

2247
01:41:23.698 --> 01:41:27.531
While you were sitting there sunning
on that $25 million boat,


2248
01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:31.198
eating your $30 a head lobster,

2249
01:41:31.281 --> 01:41:33.490
did it ever bother you
that it was all being paid for


2250
01:41:33.573 --> 01:41:35.740
by all the poor people
and destitute people


2251
01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:39.198
that your company was
systematically taking advantage of


2252
01:41:39.281 --> 01:41:41.031
and profiting from every single day?

2253
01:41:41.115 --> 01:41:42.841
- Objection! Counsel is testifying.
- Huh? Not only that,


2254
01:41:42.865 --> 01:41:45.656
they were taking advantage of 'em
at their worst time,


2255
01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:48.281
when they're downtrodden,
when they lost somebody,


2256
01:41:48.365 --> 01:41:49.948
when they're mourning somebody.

2257
01:41:50.031 --> 01:41:51.698
And now, who has to pay for it?

2258
01:41:51.781 --> 01:41:54.448
The small businessman
like Jeremiah O'Keefe.


2259
01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:56.323
The small businessman in this country,

2260
01:41:56.406 --> 01:41:58.615
who worked so hard to pay for everything

2261
01:41:58.698 --> 01:42:00.240
and stay on top and keep afloat

2262
01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:03.031
while these greedy corporations

2263
01:42:03.115 --> 01:42:04.990
do everything they can and...

2264
01:42:05.073 --> 01:42:06.281
Objection, Your Honor!

2265
01:42:06.365 --> 01:42:08.490
I think I've had quite enough of this.

2266
01:42:08.573 --> 01:42:09.573
Sit your ass down!

2267
01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:11.296
You sit your ass down

2268
01:42:11.365 --> 01:42:13.573
until I finish what I'm saying,
because I'm not done.


2269
01:42:14.615 --> 01:42:16.507
- I'm not done with my question by a long shot.
- Mr. Gary!


2270
01:42:16.531 --> 01:42:20.406
Language of that nature
will not be tolerated in my court.


2271
01:42:22.198 --> 01:42:25.115
Mr. Loewen, you may not leave
the witness stand


2272
01:42:25.198 --> 01:42:27.323
unless you're excused by me.

2273
01:42:27.406 --> 01:42:29.198
Do you understand?

2274
01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:42.865
You may continue, Mr. Gary,

2275
01:42:42.948 --> 01:42:45.073
but I warn you to tread lightly.

2276
01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:10.531
I just want to know one thing.

2277
01:43:13.156 --> 01:43:15.531
Did it ever bother you at all?

2278
01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:19.990
No.

2279
01:43:27.865 --> 01:43:30.490
That's all I need.

2280
01:43:35.198 --> 01:43:37.156
You're dismissed.

2281
01:43:46.948 --> 01:43:48.490
Motherfucker!

2282
01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:50.323
Motherfucker!

2283
01:43:50.406 --> 01:43:53.073
What was that? 
What was that?!

2284
01:43:53.156 --> 01:43:55.156
I was skewered out there!

2285
01:44:03.698 --> 01:44:06.073
Well, Sister Souljah, what you got for me?

2286
01:44:06.156 --> 01:44:08.740
Well, came to let you know
we've come to a decision.


2287
01:44:08.823 --> 01:44:11.198
Mm. We have? And what have we decided?

2288
01:44:11.281 --> 01:44:13.490
Well, in light of recent events,

2289
01:44:13.573 --> 01:44:16.073
it does feel that it would be best
for all parties involved...


2290
01:44:16.156 --> 01:44:18.365
- Oh.
- ...to reopen a settlement discussion.


2291
01:44:19.906 --> 01:44:23.365
In other words, we are...

2292
01:44:23.448 --> 01:44:25.615
we are prepared to make your client

2293
01:44:25.698 --> 01:44:28.240
a very generous offer.

2294
01:44:28.323 --> 01:44:32.115
I know that's hard for you to, uh,
get out, but how generous are we talking?


2295
01:44:32.198 --> 01:44:34.549
I mean, work with me, Willie.
It's not gonna be $100 million.


2296
01:44:34.573 --> 01:44:35.966
Work with you? 
What are you talking about?

2297
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:37.448
I mean, needless to say,

2298
01:44:37.531 --> 01:44:39.924
- it's gonna be in the range in which neither Jerry...
- Uh-huh.


2299
01:44:39.948 --> 01:44:41.424
...nor his kids
nor his grandkids would ever


2300
01:44:41.448 --> 01:44:42.799
- have to worry about anything again.
- Okay.


2301
01:44:42.823 --> 01:44:45.031
- That sound good. That sound good.
- Yes.


2302
01:44:45.115 --> 01:44:47.031
I'll tell you what.

2303
01:44:47.115 --> 01:44:49.198
Why don't we meet in your room
in a couple hours?


2304
01:44:50.365 --> 01:44:53.365
And make sure you get
your best negotiator. You know why?


2305
01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.115
Your ass gonna need it.

2306
01:44:59.115 --> 01:45:02.448
Generally, damages in tort are awarded

2307
01:45:02.531 --> 01:45:04.656
simply to restore the plaintiff
back to the position


2308
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:06.656
he or she was in before tort occurred.

2309
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:11.323
However, given how protracted
this whole matter has become,


2310
01:45:11.406 --> 01:45:13.615
we believe that it is
in all our best interests


2311
01:45:13.698 --> 01:45:15.615
just to resolve this once and for all.

2312
01:45:15.698 --> 01:45:18.073
We'd like to make you what we consider

2313
01:45:18.156 --> 01:45:19.948
a very generous offer.

2314
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:22.073
Obviously,
should you decide not to take it,


2315
01:45:22.156 --> 01:45:24.240
we can all go back into court tomorrow.

2316
01:45:24.323 --> 01:45:26.156
You can roll the dice with the jury.

2317
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.323
But, frankly, uh,
the chances that you will win


2318
01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:31.740
or come anywhere close to this number,

2319
01:45:31.823 --> 01:45:33.990
is a risk I
doubt you want to take.

2320
01:45:44.865 --> 01:45:46.365
Okay.

2321
01:45:46.448 --> 01:45:47.906
Here's our offer.

2322
01:46:08.448 --> 01:46:10.365
The answer's no.

2323
01:46:11.406 --> 01:46:13.531
Are you serious?

2324
01:46:13.615 --> 01:46:14.823
He's serious?

2325
01:46:14.906 --> 01:46:16.406
I said the answer's no.

2326
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:19.781
You mean to tell me you are
really going to turn that down?


2327
01:46:19.865 --> 01:46:22.906
You sure you don't maybe want
a little more time to think it over?


2328
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:25.656
- I've thought it over enough.
- Have you?


2329
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:29.031
I think we both know that's more money
than you'll ever see in your lifetime.


2330
01:46:29.115 --> 01:46:31.549
We gonna get down to business
or y'all gonna keep wasting our time?


2331
01:46:31.573 --> 01:46:33.740
The man said no.

2332
01:46:33.823 --> 01:46:34.823
Hmm?

2333
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.531
Mm. Okay.

2334
01:46:40.781 --> 01:46:42.615
- You sure?
- Yes.


2335
01:46:54.448 --> 01:46:56.615
- Best and final.
- Mm-hmm.


2336
01:47:30.281 --> 01:47:32.281
Answer's still no.

2337
01:47:33.656 --> 01:47:36.240
Well, this is just fucking unbelievable.

2338
01:47:36.323 --> 01:47:38.365
What the hell's your problem, O'Keefe?

2339
01:47:38.448 --> 01:47:41.031
You can't honestly tell me
that is not enough.


2340
01:47:41.115 --> 01:47:42.573
It's more than enough for me.

2341
01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:44.115
It's just not enough for you.

2342
01:47:44.198 --> 01:47:45.698
For me?

2343
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:47.490
As in enough to
put you out of business.

2344
01:47:47.573 --> 01:47:48.990
Ah.

2345
01:47:49.073 --> 01:47:50.615
Come on.

2346
01:47:50.698 --> 01:47:52.448
Let me tell you something, pal.

2347
01:47:52.531 --> 01:47:55.865
The amount of money it would take
to put me out of business...


2348
01:47:55.948 --> 01:47:58.698
the real, actual amount...

2349
01:47:58.781 --> 01:48:00.865
is a number you can't even calculate.

2350
01:48:00.948 --> 01:48:02.615
Take the money, Jerry.

2351
01:48:02.698 --> 01:48:04.323
You're 80 years old.

2352
01:48:04.406 --> 01:48:06.656
- Seventy-five.
- Can you please talk to your client?


2353
01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.990
Talk to him about what?

2354
01:48:08.073 --> 01:48:09.716
- About the fact he just turned down...
- Oh, he said no.


2355
01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.365
Last I checked, "no" means "no," right?

2356
01:48:11.448 --> 01:48:13.198
What does it feel like

2357
01:48:13.281 --> 01:48:16.906
to be some small-time, nobody
funeral director


2358
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:18.906
on the verge of bankruptcy

2359
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:22.531
who just passed on
his one and only chance


2360
01:48:22.615 --> 01:48:25.490
at $75 million?

2361
01:48:25.573 --> 01:48:27.531

<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

2393
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:44.031
Done a lot of big cases, but...

2394
01:49:45.573 --> 01:49:47.656
...this particular one is...

2395
01:49:50.823 --> 01:49:53.990
Lot of people's lives in my hand. And...

2396
01:49:55.698 --> 01:49:58.115
I think I kind of feel that
a little bit, you know.


2397
01:50:00.573 --> 01:50:02.406
Especially...

2398
01:50:02.490 --> 01:50:04.198
especially when it comes to Jerry.

2399
01:50:08.823 --> 01:50:10.323
So...

2400
01:50:12.406 --> 01:50:13.990
I don't want to lose.

01:50:14.073 --> 01:50:16.073
I mean, I don't...

2402
01:50:16.156 --> 01:50:17.906
I
-I think...

2403
01:50:18.948 --> 01:50:21.281
...what if I don't win

2404
01:50:21.365 --> 01:50:23.031
and...

2405
01:50:24.448 --> 01:50:26.531
...I let all these people down?

2406
01:50:29.073 --> 01:50:31.698
Well...

2407
01:50:31.781 --> 01:50:33.740
you're not going to let them down.

2408
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.823
So you don't need to worry.

2409
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:45.365
You know that for a fact, Miss Gloria?

2410
01:50:45.448 --> 01:50:47.365
I don't know it for a fact.

2411
01:50:47.448 --> 01:50:49.323
- I know you for a fact.
- Mm.


2412
01:50:55.406 --> 01:50:57.406
I know the man I married.

2413
01:50:58.906 --> 01:51:00.281
Yeah, baby.

2414
01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:05.031
Oh, but...

2415
01:51:06.198 --> 01:51:08.156
One suggestion, though, baby?

2416
01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.365
Yeah? What's that?

2417
01:51:12.615 --> 01:51:14.906
When you're up there in court tomorrow,

2418
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:16.740
- doing your thing...
- Doing my thing.


2419
01:51:19.615 --> 01:51:21.990
...just...

2420
01:51:22.073 --> 01:51:25.323
try not to refer to yourself
in the third person.


2421
01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.323
Okay.

2422
01:51:31.365 --> 01:51:34.281
What, um...

2423
01:51:34.365 --> 01:51:35.591
What you, what you talking about, Gloria?

2424
01:51:35.615 --> 01:51:37.573
I don't, I don't do that.

2425
01:51:37.656 --> 01:51:39.448
- Yeah, you do.
- Go on.


2426
01:51:39.531 --> 01:51:41.031
- Nah, I...
- Just a little.


2427
01:51:41.115 --> 01:51:44.156
I don't think I do that.

2428
01:51:45.156 --> 01:51:46.281
I don't.

2429
01:51:46.365 --> 01:51:49.281
"Girl, get ready.
Willie Gary coming upstairs now!"


2430
01:51:49.365 --> 01:51:52.115
Trust me.

2431
01:51:52.198 --> 01:51:53.656
You do.

2432
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:58.448
I... I guess Willie Gary does do that
every once in a while.


2433
01:52:30.573 --> 01:52:32.823
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

2434
01:52:35.198 --> 01:52:37.615
...I just have one small question to ask.

2435
01:52:39.573 --> 01:52:43.656
Do y'all mind if I keep things simple?
Hmm?


2436
01:52:44.365 --> 01:52:46.365
Just plain and ordinary talk.

2437
01:53:12.115 --> 01:53:13.990
<i>Has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

2438
01:53:18.281 --> 01:53:20.823
After careful consideration,

2439
01:53:20.906 --> 01:53:25.156

...to be paid to Mr. O'Keefe
by defendant Loewen Group, LLC.

Come on!

2452
01:55:07.073 --> 01:55:09.240
$500 million, Jerry.

2453
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.448
I know it, Willie.

2454
01:55:15.781 --> 01:55:17.531
I know it.

2455
01:55:49.031 --> 01:55:50.906
Hey, Willie.

2456
01:55:52.281 --> 01:55:53.823
Hey, Mame.

01:55:53.906 --> 01:55:55.948
What you do, you, uh...

2458
01:55:56.031 --> 01:55:57.466
come down here for your last licking?

2459
01:55:57.490 --> 01:55:59.073
Oh, my last licking?

2460
01:55:59.156 --> 01:56:00.573
No.

2461
01:56:00.656 --> 01:56:02.336
I actually just wanted
to congratulate you.


2462
01:56:02.365 --> 01:56:03.448
Really?

2463
01:56:03.531 --> 01:56:04.948
- Yeah.
- Congratulate me?


2464
01:56:05.031 --> 01:56:06.198
Mm-hmm.

2465
01:56:06.281 --> 01:56:08.156
Now come on. You mean that?

2466
01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.240
Listen, I hate losing.

2467
01:56:10.323 --> 01:56:13.156
But it was a well-earned victory.
I can be honest about that.


2468
01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:16.115
