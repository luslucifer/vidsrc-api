1
00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:58.220
Lights out!

2
00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:23.201
<i>...struggle which followed the death of Lenin...</i>

3
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.619
<i>...Joseph Stalin prevailed.</i>

4
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:30.507
<i>Stalin was the new face
of an old idea: Marxism.</i>

5
00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:34.045
<i>While the Bolsheviks firmly
established their authority at home...</i>

6
00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.053
<i>...the Comintern fomented revolution throughout the world.</i>

7
00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.884
<i>Communism was on the march.</i>

8
00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:43.303
<i>Stalin was in the Kremlin.</i>

9
00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:45.223
<i>But what of the common people?</i>

10
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.061
<i>What of the proletariat?</i>

11
00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:50.398
<i>Those who fought to win a new world?</i>

12
00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.484
<i>If we look at the history...</i>

13
00:02:57.788 --> 00:02:59.404
They're frying someone, Pop.

14
00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:01.538
You're on the Hades Express, mister.

15
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:03.119
Quiet.

16
00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:05.751
Death is nothing to celebrate.

17
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.084
- Don't matter who it is.
- He just died.


18
00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:10.918
His name was Wayne Fisher.

19
00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:15.336
He was <i>32</i> years old, and
he killed a lady with a hammer.

20
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.798
He had a rib
eye for his last meal.

21
00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.763
He's been on death row
at Dewbend for three years.

22
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:27.185
- And his last words were, "Go to hell."
- How do you know that?


23
00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.440
It's just in my head.

24
00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:32.148
All right.
It's past your bedtime, children.


25
00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:34.359
Go brush your teeth
and go to bed, please.

26
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:38.026
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

27
00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:41.446
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

28
00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:44.240
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

29
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.003
Elise, I thought I told you
to put all these toys away.

30
00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.801
You're not listening to me.

31
00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:02.012
It wasn't me who made this mess.

32
00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:03.550
Then who was it?

33
00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.061
Christian, shut the door, please.

34
00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:16.647
You can tell me.

35
00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.576
It was the little boy.

36
00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.239
He lived here a long time ago,
and he loves playing with our toys.

37
00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.079
- I swear.
- I believe you.


38
00:04:28.253 --> 00:04:29.334
I do.

39
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.214
You know, you've been blessed with a gift.

40
00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:35.961
You're special.

41
00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:39.170
Some people are afraid of special people.

42
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.756
Your daddy, he's one of them.

43
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.893
He doesn't understand your gift.

44
00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:50.060
You just keep it between
us from now on, okay?

45
00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:53.266
Okay.

46
00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:58.989
It's time for bed.

47
00:05:03.914 --> 00:05:06.451
- Good night.
- Don't turn off the light, Mom.


48
00:05:10.378 --> 00:05:12.836
I'm gonna be right out there, honey.

49
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.668
And if you ever get
scared, what do you do?

50
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.125
That's right.

51
00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:22.467
I gave you this, so that if
you ever get scared, you can go:

52
00:05:24.768 --> 00:05:27.476
Wherever I am, I'll come running.
But you gotta save it...


53
00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:30.809
- ...for when you really need me, okay?
- Okay.


54
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.062
I love you both so much.

55
00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:37.853
- Love you too, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.


56
00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:49.206
<i>We see an actual atomic bombing run.</i>

57
00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:52.789
<i>Heading for the target is
Backseat, code name for the ship.</i>

58
00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:53.998
<i>The radio navigator...</i>

59
00:05:55.507 --> 00:05:56.713
Hey.

60
00:05:56.883 --> 00:05:58.169
What?

61
00:05:58.343 --> 00:06:00.425
You asleep yet?

62
00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.177
No.

63
00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:08.138
Do you ever think about the
people who go to the electric chair?

64
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.183
Sometimes.

65
00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:18.819
Do you wonder where
they go after it's done?

66
00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:20.445
No.

67
00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.532
I know where they go.

68
00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:25.363
Oh, yeah?

69
00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:27.027
Where?

70
00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:33.333
They go into the dark.

71
00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:52.143
Christian?

72
00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:35.054
What are you doing?

73
00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:05.008
Elise.

74
00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:24.690
You made all the mess, didn't you?

75
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:28.322
Yes.

76
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:35.580
Where's my whistle?

77
00:08:37.252 --> 00:08:38.834
The boy is in the closet.

78
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.246
It's okay.

79
00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:43.754
We won't hurt you.

80
00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:46.674
Come on out.

81
00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:49.086
Stop it, Elise.

82
00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:52.255
Come on out.

83
00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:56.059
I'm not in the closet.

84
00:09:04.487 --> 00:09:05.943
<i>The people took their revenge.</i>

85
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.856
Gerald. Gerald, no.

86
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.491
What have you done, Elise?

87
00:09:13.746 --> 00:09:15.862
- Put your hands on the wall.
- Leave her alone.


88
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.371
Quiet, Audrey!

89
00:09:25.049 --> 00:09:26.505
Did you see a ghost?

90
00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:28.337
Gerald, stop it.

91
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:30.001
Yes.

92
00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:36.846
I don't want to hurt you, girl.

93
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.012
Just say no. That's
all you have to do.

94
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.397
I'm just gonna ask you again.

95
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.271
Did you see a ghost?

96
00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:46.480
Yes, I did.

97
00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:49.404
They're all around us in this house.

98
00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:51.940
They're everywhere.

99
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.152
You don't have to do this. Please.

100
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.617
She's just a little girl, Gerald. Please.

101
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.202
No. No, Daddy.

102
00:10:00.376 --> 00:10:01.491
No, no.

103
00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:05.545
No, no, no. Take me. 
Please take me.

104
00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:08.753
- Help me.
- Please, please, please. Gerald, stop!


105
00:10:08.927 --> 00:10:11.214
- Please, honey, she's had enough.
- Don't. Stop.


106
00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:12.752
Please don't. No.

107
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.049
Don't tell me how to punish her.
I punish people for a living.


108
00:10:16.226 --> 00:10:17.387
Please!

109
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.971
Please, not in there.

110
00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:21.261
No, no, no.

111
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.056
No, Daddy!

112
00:10:24.234 --> 00:10:26.896
No. Daddy, please, 
I don't wanna go in there!

113
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.107
No, not in there.

114
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.738
No, Daddy, please, not in there!

115
00:10:31.908 --> 00:10:34.366
Daddy, let me out! 
Daddy, please!

116
00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:36.117
You can either follow my rules...

117
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:39.496
...and sleep under my roof or you
can break them and sleep under my floor.

118
00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:41.077
Don't put me in here, Daddy.

119
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.457
Daddy, please.

120
00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:45.915
Daddy, come back.
I don't wanna be in here alone.


121
00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:48.296
Daddy, please!

122
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:15.084
Are you scared of the dark?

123
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:18.594
Who is that? Who's there?

124
00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:25.602
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:28.230
I can make it light.

126
00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:52.541
Who is that?

127
00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:55.335
Why are you down here?

128
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.672
My daddy put me down here.

129
00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:01.463
Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

130
00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:03.223
Open this door.

131
00:13:03.393 --> 00:13:05.805
There'll be lots of light.

132
00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.186
Go on. Open it.

133
00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:12.816
There's a key hanging up right there.

134
00:13:13.403 --> 00:13:15.770
Take your time. I can wait.

135
00:13:15.947 --> 00:13:19.611
You're the only one
that can open the door.

136
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.072
You are more powerful than you know.

137
00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:27.035
I want you to help
me open all the doors.

138
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.364
<i>Don't forget what Bill
the turtle just did, everyone...</i>

139
00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:49.700
<i>...because we might have
to do the same thing.</i>

140
00:14:49.874 --> 00:14:52.366
<i>That's what this is all about, my friends.</i>

141
00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:54.204
<i>Duck and cover.</i>

142
00:14:54.754 --> 00:14:56.711
<i>This is an official civil defense film...</i>

143
00:14:56.881 --> 00:14:59.213
<i>...produced in cooperation with the Federal Civil...</i>

144
00:15:06.098 --> 00:15:07.554
Elise?

145
00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:15.604
<i>...for the ultimate...</i>

146
00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:30.657
Elise?

147
00:15:44.762 --> 00:15:45.877
Audrey?

148
00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:50.010
Audrey.

149
00:15:51.644 --> 00:15:53.305
Audrey!

150
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:55.891
No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

151
00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:59.023
No. No. No.

152
00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:02.815
No, Audrey!

153
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:04.730
I'm sorry.

154
00:16:05.992 --> 00:16:09.326
No!

155
00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:06.583
Good morning.

156
00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:09.173
The dreams are coming back, Warren.

157
00:17:10.389 --> 00:17:12.847
Just won't go away, will it?

158
00:17:13.017 --> 00:17:16.385
How would you like breakfast in bed?

159
00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:18.970
I thought so.

160
00:17:19.148 --> 00:17:23.608
- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...


161
00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:27.237
...from the church. We missed something.
There is movement in the frame.


162
00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:30.773
- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.


163
00:17:31.243 --> 00:17:34.907
- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.


164
00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:38.365
The reason I was up all night.

165
00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:41.659
The lights.

166
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.838
That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.


167
00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:49.467
No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...

168
00:17:49.637 --> 00:17:51.674
...straining fingers as you switch them.

169
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:54.054
Yeah, that was a
real problem before, you know.

170
00:17:54.225 --> 00:17:56.512
Toil in the darkness of sarcasm, my friend.

171
00:17:56.686 --> 00:18:01.271
I prefer to work in the lights.

172
00:18:05.444 --> 00:18:07.185
The lights?

173
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.737
Lights!

174
00:18:13.577 --> 00:18:14.612
Bad acoustics.

175
00:18:14.787 --> 00:18:19.076
Natural light's better for the environment anyway.
Voila.


176
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.491
I love that you boys
are staying in the house.

177
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:25.412
But please don't try to
fix anything else that isn't broken.

178
00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:31.668
Spectral Sightings.

179
00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:34.087
Yes, she is.

180
00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:35.721
Elise!

181
00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:39.893
- This is Elise.
<i>- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i>


182
00:18:40.062 --> 00:18:42.019
Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.

183
00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:44.726
<i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i>

184
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.016
<i>Things are happening in my house...</i>

185
00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:49.982
<i>...and they say that
you know about this stuff.</i>

186
00:18:50.156 --> 00:18:51.567
I know some things.

187
00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:55.200
<i>Yeah, well, 
I was wondering if you could take a look.</i>

188
00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:59.954
<i>I need... I need
help is the thing, see.</i>

189
00:19:00.124 --> 00:19:01.614
May I ask where you live?

190
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:06.377
<i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i>

191
00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:09.455
<i>...Five Keys, 
New Mexico.</i>

192
00:19:19.268 --> 00:19:21.179
Mr. Garza...

193
00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:24.892
...I wish I could help
you, but I really can't.

194
00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:26.806
I'm so sorry.

195
00:19:26.984 --> 00:19:30.147
I thank you very
much for thinking of me.

196
00:19:55.805 --> 00:19:58.513
Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

197
00:19:59.058 --> 00:20:02.267
That man who called today about a job...

198
00:20:05.397 --> 00:20:09.311
...he told me he lives in
the house that I grew up in.

199
00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:14.362
I call it a house
because it wasn't a... a home.

200
00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:24.623
I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.


201
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.999
This gift I have that you
boys are so in awe of...

202
00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:35.375
...my father tried to
beat it out of me.

203
00:20:37.555 --> 00:20:39.011
And...

204
00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:40.718
...my mother...

205
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.807
...she was killed in that house.

206
00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:47.972
She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.

207
00:20:48.607 --> 00:20:51.850
This demon wants to use my abilities...

208
00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:54.439
...and it will hurt the ones
I love to get to me.

209
00:20:54.613 --> 00:20:57.105
That's why I never want
to go into The Further...

210
00:20:57.283 --> 00:20:59.365
...like I did for Quinn.

211
00:20:59.535 --> 00:21:03.278
I have spent my life fighting these things...

212
00:21:03.455 --> 00:21:07.198
...because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.

213
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.876
So...

214
00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:14.546
...I have to help this man...

215
00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:18.672
...because I know what he's up against.

216
00:21:20.097 --> 00:21:23.385
We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.


217
00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:25.300
Not this time.

218
00:21:26.145 --> 00:21:28.682
This one, I have to do...

219
00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:31.059
...alone.

220
00:22:15.778 --> 00:22:19.772
We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.


221
00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:22.907
Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

222
00:24:03.469 --> 00:24:05.255
Before we go inside...

223
00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:07.796
...I brought some clothes for you boys.

224
00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:13.635
Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.

225
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.522
I bet I can guess who you are.

226
00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:20.899
There's no need. I'm Elise.

227
00:24:21.487 --> 00:24:23.194
- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...


228
00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:24.694
...my associates.

229
00:24:24.865 --> 00:24:26.697
She's psychic.

230
00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:28.983
We're sidekick.

231
00:24:29.453 --> 00:24:30.909
What was that?

232
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.072
She's psychic. 
We're sidekick.

233
00:24:35.626 --> 00:24:39.119
- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.


234
00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:42.163
You wanna come in? Here.

235
00:24:42.341 --> 00:24:45.003
Come on. I'm supposed to
invite you in. Come on.

236
00:24:45.677 --> 00:24:47.259
Hello.

237
00:24:57.022 --> 00:24:58.308
<i>...aggression.</i>

238
00:24:58.482 --> 00:25:01.474
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

239
00:25:01.652 --> 00:25:04.986
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

240
00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:06.771
<i>...if we do not confront them...</i>

241
00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:08.986
You still have so
much of our old stuff.

242
00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.116
It was all here.

243
00:25:12.329 --> 00:25:14.536
Pretty good stuff, you know?

244
00:25:14.706 --> 00:25:16.788
I didn't see any reason
to get rid of it.

245
00:25:17.459 --> 00:25:19.496
There's stories.

246
00:25:20.671 --> 00:25:22.082
About your family.

247
00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:24.873
I never listened to
them when they said that...

248
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.382
...this wasn't a place that I should live.

249
00:25:27.553 --> 00:25:30.511
You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.

250
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.928
I said, "Screw the
stories," and I bought it.

251
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:40.767
Now I believe the stories.

252
00:25:46.572 --> 00:25:48.358
You getting anything?

253
00:25:49.116 --> 00:25:52.734
There are so many spirits, it's hard
to tell the good from the evil.

254
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:55.744
A lot of people died in that prison.

255
00:25:55.914 --> 00:25:57.700
When did these occurrences start?

256
00:25:57.875 --> 00:26:00.242
Soon after I moved in.

257
00:26:03.505 --> 00:26:05.587
First, it was...

258
00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:07.839
...the little things, you know?

259
00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:09.667
Things that...

260
00:26:13.473 --> 00:26:16.261
<i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i>

261
00:26:32.993 --> 00:26:35.030
<i>You're special.</i>

262
00:26:35.454 --> 00:26:38.446
<i>You just keep it between
us from now on, okay?</i>

263
00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:42.075
<i>No. No!</i>

264
00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:46.044
You okay?

265
00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:52.043
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

266
00:26:52.971 --> 00:26:55.133
These experiences you're having...

267
00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:57.014
...where do they mainly occur?

268
00:26:58.977 --> 00:27:01.309
Mostly in one room.

269
00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:04.688
I keep it locked now.

270
00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:07.646
I haven't opened it in three months.

271
00:27:12.658 --> 00:27:14.490
I'll take that one.

272
00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:16.818
You wanna give me a hand?

273
00:27:18.413 --> 00:27:19.995
That's good.

274
00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:23.908
A little bit more.

275
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.396
Sorry.

276
00:27:53.573 --> 00:27:55.484
Can't go in there.

277
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.707
When it first started...

278
00:28:09.589 --> 00:28:13.298
...I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.

279
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.128
Someone was talking to themselves.

280
00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:30.816
You think you're going crazy, and then you...

281
00:28:30.986 --> 00:28:33.273
You actually hear it.

282
00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:37.527
And you know you're not.

283
00:28:37.993 --> 00:28:40.826
Finally, one day, 
I walked in...

284
00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:43.112
...and I screamed at it:

285
00:28:43.582 --> 00:28:45.368
"You stop."

286
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.292
"You stop.

287
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.791
Please stop."

288
00:28:53.925 --> 00:28:56.462
My whole life savings is in this place.

289
00:28:56.636 --> 00:28:58.218
You gotta help me.

290
00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:00.049
You gotta help me, please.

291
00:29:00.807 --> 00:29:02.889
That's what we do.

292
00:29:06.605 --> 00:29:10.223
The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.

293
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:14.143
We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

294
00:29:19.242 --> 00:29:22.109
I think I'm gonna go there now.

295
00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:35.585
You really are gonna stay here all alone?

296
00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:41.300
My presence tends to draw the
spirits out of their dark, little corners.

297
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.512
You need to take this.

298
00:29:47.187 --> 00:29:48.803
Thank you.

299
00:29:50.107 --> 00:29:51.222
Good night.

300
00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:15.166
Can you hear us, Elise?

301
00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:20.710
Yes. Try not to
drown out the other voices.

302
00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:23.299
<i>We got you. We gone.</i>

303
00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:26.219
Here you go.

304
00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:29.510
- What's this?
- Lights.


305
00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:32.346
Thanks.

306
00:31:52.646 --> 00:31:55.138
I thought you were gone forever.

307
00:31:57.692 --> 00:31:59.399
<i>My mother got this for my brother...</i>

308
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:02.857
...and he lost it when
he was 6 years old.

309
00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:14.285
Safe now.

310
00:34:32.055 --> 00:34:33.341
- Stop.
- What?


311
00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:34.846
Go back, to the left.

312
00:34:38.353 --> 00:34:40.640
- What?
- Yeah, nothing.


313
00:34:40.814 --> 00:34:42.805
Thought I saw some feet.

314
00:34:42.982 --> 00:34:44.143
Feet?

315
00:35:09.592 --> 00:35:12.630
Elise, there's someone right in front of you.

316
00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:16.172
<i>Looks like a woman.</i>

317
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:17.885
I don't see anything.

318
00:35:18.893 --> 00:35:21.681
<i>Elise, be careful.</i>

319
00:35:27.652 --> 00:35:29.939
I don't see what you're seeing.

320
00:35:32.157 --> 00:35:35.491
<i>You're going to touch it.</i>

321
00:35:36.661 --> 00:35:37.661
Be careful.

322
00:35:42.041 --> 00:35:43.247
Help her.

323
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:50.919
Elise? Elise? What happened?

324
00:35:52.177 --> 00:35:53.667
The whistle.

325
00:35:53.845 --> 00:35:55.882
It took the whistle.

326
00:35:56.055 --> 00:35:58.387
What were you doing in there?

327
00:35:58.558 --> 00:36:01.220
Thought you were gonna stay in the bedroom.

328
00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:03.226
Something led me down there.

329
00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:05.228
The spirit of a woman.

330
00:36:05.648 --> 00:36:09.733
I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...

331
00:36:10.236 --> 00:36:11.852
...in this house.

332
00:36:13.573 --> 00:36:16.406
When I was 16 years old.

333
00:36:38.598 --> 00:36:40.430
Did you hear that?

334
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.761
Hear what?

335
00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:44.552
There's someone in the laundry room.

336
00:36:44.729 --> 00:36:46.219
No, there isn't.

337
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:48.437
I heard it.

338
00:36:48.608 --> 00:36:49.939
I'm gonna go look.

339
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:52.692
No. Don't, Elise.

340
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.446
Hello.

341
00:37:02.247 --> 00:37:04.158
I live here with my brother, Christian.

342
00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:06.824
- What's your name?
- Stop it.


343
00:37:07.252 --> 00:37:08.868
You're making it up.

344
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:13.213
Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.


345
00:37:13.383 --> 00:37:14.873
Christian!

346
00:37:21.474 --> 00:37:23.215
What are you doing, girl?

347
00:37:23.643 --> 00:37:25.930
There's someone in the laundry.

348
00:37:36.447 --> 00:37:37.653
There's no one in here.

349
00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:42.943
You're doing it again.

350
00:37:45.832 --> 00:37:49.621
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.


351
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.167
If there's one thing...

352
00:37:54.799 --> 00:37:57.791
...you've been doing your whole life, Elise...

353
00:37:57.969 --> 00:37:59.209
...it's ask for it.

354
00:38:10.815 --> 00:38:13.773
I won't let you hurt me anymore.

355
00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:19.104
Please!

356
00:38:19.782 --> 00:38:21.614
Elise.

357
00:38:22.827 --> 00:38:24.283
Elise!

358
00:38:27.624 --> 00:38:29.240
Elise, don't go!

359
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:34.920
Leave her be. Leave her be.

360
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:40.005
She needs to learn that nobody
else can possibly love someone like her.

361
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.558
I haven't been back here since.

362
00:38:58.321 --> 00:39:00.904
I think that's all for tonight.

363
00:39:01.074 --> 00:39:02.940
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

364
00:39:07.413 --> 00:39:10.405
Christian and I came
here a lot as kids.

365
00:39:10.875 --> 00:39:12.741
Do I look okay?

366
00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:14.626
Yeah, of course.

367
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:26.671
All right.

368
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.350
I'm sorry. I...

369
00:39:38.528 --> 00:39:41.065
You just look so much
like someone I know very well.

370
00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:42.855
Oh, really?

371
00:39:43.783 --> 00:39:44.818
I'm Elise.

372
00:39:44.993 --> 00:39:46.108
Melissa.

373
00:39:46.285 --> 00:39:47.446
Imogen.

374
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.328
- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.


375
00:39:50.498 --> 00:39:52.114
Tucker.

376
00:39:52.291 --> 00:39:53.827
Specs.

377
00:39:54.502 --> 00:39:56.368
I'm Specs. Or Steven.

378
00:39:56.546 --> 00:39:57.786
Whatever. Your choice.

379
00:39:57.964 --> 00:40:00.126
She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

380
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.040
I'm sorry?

381
00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:04.717
Forget it.

382
00:40:04.887 --> 00:40:07.675
- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.


383
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:10.716
Actually, it's pretty <i>confidencial.</i>

384
00:40:10.893 --> 00:40:13.681
It's a poltergeist infestation involving Ted Garza.

385
00:40:13.855 --> 00:40:16.392
Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?


386
00:40:16.566 --> 00:40:19.024
Ghosts and ghouls.

387
00:40:19.193 --> 00:40:21.355
What he's trying to
say is we're ghost hunters.

388
00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:23.236
The three of us.

389
00:40:23.406 --> 00:40:24.942
Kind of like cops.

390
00:40:25.116 --> 00:40:27.107
Only we don't arrest humans.

391
00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:30.865
I'm funny too. 
A lot of the time.

392
00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:33.076
- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.


393
00:40:33.249 --> 00:40:35.411
- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?


394
00:40:36.919 --> 00:40:40.332
I used to live in
this town a long time ago.

395
00:40:40.506 --> 00:40:42.713
Well, good for you. You got out.

396
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.752
I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...


397
00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:48.419
No, you're not.

398
00:40:48.598 --> 00:40:51.215
It's really nice to meet you.

399
00:40:51.392 --> 00:40:54.100
- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.


400
00:40:54.937 --> 00:40:56.848
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?


401
00:41:07.784 --> 00:41:09.070
Hello, Christian.

402
00:41:10.703 --> 00:41:12.193
Have I aged that much?

403
00:41:16.626 --> 00:41:19.209
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

404
00:41:19.378 --> 00:41:20.914
I have nothing to say to you.

405
00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:22.454
Girls, come on. Let's go.

406
00:41:22.632 --> 00:41:23.918
- Come on.
- We just got here.


407
00:41:24.092 --> 00:41:26.003
Hear me out.

408
00:41:26.177 --> 00:41:29.010
I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

409
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.219
That only means something if I choose it
to mean something, and I choose it not to.

410
00:41:33.392 --> 00:41:34.848
Please, Christian.

411
00:41:35.019 --> 00:41:38.228
I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.


412
00:41:38.397 --> 00:41:41.185
- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?


413
00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:43.817
- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.


414
00:41:43.986 --> 00:41:45.351
Listen to me. You listen.

415
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.740
Now, when we were children, you terrified me.

416
00:41:49.909 --> 00:41:52.571
You scared the life out of me...

417
00:41:52.745 --> 00:41:55.578
...with stories about a
monster behind a red door...

418
00:41:55.748 --> 00:41:58.661
...and then you opened
the door and you left.

419
00:41:58.835 --> 00:42:00.417
You left me.

420
00:42:00.586 --> 00:42:03.795
You abandoned me to
a real monster, our father.

421
00:42:04.757 --> 00:42:09.342
Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.

422
00:42:09.512 --> 00:42:11.219
You stay away.

423
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.880
Christian.

424
00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:24.729
Christian!

425
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.447
I was stupid to come back here.

426
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.611
No, you weren't. 
You're helping people.

427
00:42:36.789 --> 00:42:38.621
That's what you do, remember?

428
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:40.498
Elise.

429
00:42:40.668 --> 00:42:42.409
I'm sorry.

430
00:42:42.587 --> 00:42:45.124
He can be unreasonable sometimes.

431
00:42:45.548 --> 00:42:48.882
Knowing what he grew
up with, that's perfectly understandable.

432
00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:51.383
He's never told us anything about his childhood.

433
00:42:52.013 --> 00:42:53.595
I've never even seen a picture.

434
00:42:53.764 --> 00:42:56.756
He never told us anything about you.

435
00:42:57.643 --> 00:43:02.058
I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

436
00:43:02.231 --> 00:43:05.064
He is a great dad, you know?

437
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:06.941
I love him a lot.

438
00:43:07.111 --> 00:43:10.274
You have no idea how
happy that makes me, honey.

439
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.776
- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?


440
00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:19.070
Do you have the
still frames that we printed?

441
00:43:19.248 --> 00:43:21.034
- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.


442
00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:24.372
- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?


443
00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:26.377
- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.


444
00:43:26.881 --> 00:43:28.371
Come on.

445
00:43:35.598 --> 00:43:37.054
Here you go.

446
00:43:37.225 --> 00:43:40.343
Here. You give this to your dad...

447
00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:43.853
...and you tell him it was
taken yesterday in our old bedroom.

448
00:43:44.023 --> 00:43:47.106
Oh, I think he will
be very surprised to see it.

449
00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:51.569
I'm so happy to meet you.

450
00:43:55.952 --> 00:43:57.363
Okay.

451
00:44:07.713 --> 00:44:09.124
Testing. One, two.

452
00:44:09.298 --> 00:44:11.164
Can you hear me, guys?

453
00:44:12.093 --> 00:44:15.051
- No.
- I noticed this last night...


454
00:44:15.805 --> 00:44:18.012
...but I couldn't quite place it.

455
00:44:18.182 --> 00:44:21.720
Then Christian reminded me that
when I was a child...

456
00:44:21.894 --> 00:44:24.386
...I saw a red door.

457
00:44:24.563 --> 00:44:28.147
The entity that killed
my mother came through it.

458
00:44:30.278 --> 00:44:34.272
I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.


459
00:44:34.448 --> 00:44:36.689
No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.


460
00:44:36.867 --> 00:44:40.235
Remember when I went into
The Further to find Quinn Brenner?

461
00:44:40.413 --> 00:44:42.529
I came across a red door.

462
00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:49.287
<i>And I... I passed through it, and
it took me deeper into The Further.</i>

463
00:44:49.463 --> 00:44:51.955
If I can find out what it means...

464
00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:57.836
...I might be able to stop
the thing that's haunting this house.

465
00:44:58.014 --> 00:45:00.255
Well, this might help.

466
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.478
I spoke to you last night.

467
00:45:12.945 --> 00:45:15.858
Are you there? 
Can you hear me?

468
00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:25.033
You took something from me.

469
00:45:25.207 --> 00:45:26.823
Why?

470
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.042
<i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i>

471
00:45:30.212 --> 00:45:31.543
<i>Help who?</i>

472
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:10.457
This way.

473
00:48:07.369 --> 00:48:09.076
Is that you?

474
00:48:11.957 --> 00:48:14.699
Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

475
00:48:14.877 --> 00:48:17.960
Are you the woman I saw last night?

476
00:48:23.177 --> 00:48:25.965
Is there an entity in this house...

477
00:48:26.138 --> 00:48:29.005
...that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

478
00:48:33.395 --> 00:48:35.727
Are you that entity?

479
00:48:42.238 --> 00:48:45.196
Is there something you're trying to show me?

480
00:48:50.162 --> 00:48:52.654
Is what you want to show me...

481
00:48:52.831 --> 00:48:55.072
...behind this wall?

482
00:49:37.084 --> 00:49:38.165
Keys.

483
00:49:48.387 --> 00:49:51.175
Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

484
00:49:52.099 --> 00:49:53.555
On.

485
00:49:53.726 --> 00:49:55.137
Wait. On.

486
00:50:56.538 --> 00:50:57.949
Wait.

487
00:51:05.881 --> 00:51:07.542
Thank you.

488
00:51:39.707 --> 00:51:41.948
What is it you wanna show me?

489
00:52:23.917 --> 00:52:25.078
Help her!

490
00:52:48.317 --> 00:52:50.308
Help me.

491
00:52:56.617 --> 00:52:58.574
That's not a ghost.

492
00:52:58.744 --> 00:53:01.076
Oh, my God.

493
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.622
Oh, my God.

494
00:53:05.793 --> 00:53:07.283
I'll break the chain.

495
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:08.747
No, you won't.

496
00:53:12.007 --> 00:53:13.338
Move.

497
00:53:13.967 --> 00:53:15.002
Get away from her!

498
00:53:15.552 --> 00:53:18.920
I asked you, help me
get rid of the ghost.

499
00:53:19.097 --> 00:53:20.883
Help me get rid of it!

500
00:53:21.058 --> 00:53:22.765
<i>Help me!</i>

501
00:53:24.144 --> 00:53:27.262
Why did you have to come down here?

502
00:53:29.733 --> 00:53:33.067
- Why?!
- Your ghost led us down here.


503
00:53:33.237 --> 00:53:35.478
He's in my head.

504
00:53:37.533 --> 00:53:38.864
He's in my head.

505
00:53:57.219 --> 00:53:59.381
Is that your friend?

506
00:54:00.722 --> 00:54:02.838
That is your friend.

507
00:54:53.817 --> 00:54:56.104
You there, Specs?

508
00:55:03.285 --> 00:55:04.992
Specs!

509
00:55:11.043 --> 00:55:12.283
What?

510
00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:23.900
Her name is Mara Jennings.

511
00:56:24.074 --> 00:56:26.907
She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.

512
00:56:27.077 --> 00:56:29.444
She's been missing for approximately four months.

513
00:56:31.748 --> 00:56:33.204
Watch your step down.

514
00:56:36.169 --> 00:56:39.878
- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.


515
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:42.415
I'm gonna have to get
statements from all of you.

516
00:56:52.352 --> 00:56:55.890
There are plenty of demons in
this world who are very much alive...

517
00:56:56.314 --> 00:56:58.726
...and you stopped one of them.

518
00:57:01.903 --> 00:57:04.440
Thanks, Elise.

519
00:57:46.615 --> 00:57:48.356
Dad, this is crazy.

520
00:57:48.533 --> 00:57:51.150
This is something I have to do.

521
00:57:59.878 --> 00:58:00.959
<i>I gotta find it.</i>

522
00:58:01.505 --> 00:58:04.918
It's a little whistle, a little silver whistle.

523
00:58:05.092 --> 00:58:08.881
Look, I deal in the spirit world...

524
00:58:09.054 --> 00:58:13.969
...and spirits can make people do
bad things in the real world.

525
00:58:14.142 --> 00:58:17.760
Some of these people
come to me for help.

526
00:58:18.688 --> 00:58:20.429
But to you, that's weird.

527
00:58:20.607 --> 00:58:23.440
To me, it's a day job.

528
00:58:26.822 --> 00:58:28.654
This one was different though.

529
00:58:30.242 --> 00:58:33.234
The haunted house was my house.

530
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:37.825
It's not in here.

531
00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:40.996
Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

532
00:58:42.254 --> 00:58:44.495
Why would Garza invite you up...

533
00:58:44.673 --> 00:58:48.041
...knowing the risk that you might discover Mara?

534
00:58:53.723 --> 00:58:58.183
These hauntings can be terrifying things.

535
00:58:59.563 --> 00:59:02.305
Maybe the fear of the beyond...

536
00:59:02.482 --> 00:59:05.850
...overcame the fear of getting caught.

537
00:59:06.403 --> 00:59:08.144
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

538
00:59:12.784 --> 00:59:14.366
What? What is it?

539
00:59:15.745 --> 00:59:17.327
I'm sorry.

540
00:59:17.497 --> 00:59:20.205
I'm seeing things.

541
00:59:20.709 --> 00:59:22.916
The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

542
00:59:23.086 --> 00:59:25.123
Do you need me for anything else?

543
00:59:25.297 --> 00:59:26.628
No.

544
00:59:26.798 --> 00:59:28.288
Thank you.

545
00:59:37.475 --> 00:59:39.091
Melissa?

546
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.806
Dad?

547
00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.972
Down here, honey. 
I found the whistle.

548
01:00:08.381 --> 01:00:09.746
Dad?

549
01:02:37.197 --> 01:02:39.734
- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?


550
01:02:39.908 --> 01:02:42.570
What happened to her? Where is she?

551
01:02:42.744 --> 01:02:44.826
- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.


552
01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.217
Oh, God, no.

553
01:03:07.936 --> 01:03:09.847
Imogen, call an ambulance.

554
01:03:10.021 --> 01:03:11.511
Now!

555
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:28.946
How did you know where she was?

556
01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.706
What happened to her?

557
01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:35.123
There's something evil in that house...

558
01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.128
...and I let it into this world.

559
01:03:37.298 --> 01:03:39.539
I think it made Ted
Garza do what he did...

560
01:03:39.717 --> 01:03:42.675
...and it's taken your sister's
spirit, and I'm gonna find it...

561
01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:44.712
...and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

562
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:48.806
I can see things too.

563
01:04:00.738 --> 01:04:03.070
When I was a little girl...

564
01:04:03.575 --> 01:04:06.363
...I went to sleep and
floated out of my bedroom...

565
01:04:06.828 --> 01:04:09.320
...all the way to our elderly neighbor's house.

566
01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:13.536
Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.

567
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:17.169
My dad told me she
had died the night before.

568
01:04:17.338 --> 01:04:19.796
I told him I already knew.

569
01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:24.592
- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.


570
01:04:24.762 --> 01:04:25.968
Come on, honey.

571
01:04:26.139 --> 01:04:28.847
No, I... I'm staying.

572
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:31.971
Just trust me, okay?

573
01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:38.265
Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.

574
01:04:40.361 --> 01:04:41.851
Son of a...

575
01:04:44.115 --> 01:04:48.074
I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.

576
01:04:48.244 --> 01:04:50.326
I need things that were important to Garza.

577
01:04:50.497 --> 01:04:52.488
Specs, go upstairs.

578
01:04:52.665 --> 01:04:55.123
There is a Bible he
held very dear to him.

579
01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:59.252
It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.

580
01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:01.288
- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.


581
01:05:01.466 --> 01:05:03.548
- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.


582
01:05:04.052 --> 01:05:06.544
Tucker and I are going
down to the fallout shelter.

583
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:09.930
I get the death chamber, he
gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?

584
01:05:10.099 --> 01:05:11.214
That's not a democracy.

585
01:05:11.392 --> 01:05:14.510
You're the only one I trust
to go down there with me.

586
01:05:15.355 --> 01:05:17.642
Don't patronize me, woman.

587
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:21.563
So why do you guys dress like that?

588
01:05:23.613 --> 01:05:26.446
It was Elise's idea. 
She dressed us.

589
01:05:27.742 --> 01:05:31.360
No, my usual style's
a lot more laid back.

590
01:05:31.538 --> 01:05:33.028
It's a little weird.

591
01:05:33.957 --> 01:05:35.698
- What?
- Dude.


592
01:05:39.546 --> 01:05:41.662
This is vintage. 
No, this is worth a lot.

593
01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:44.581
I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

594
01:05:44.759 --> 01:05:46.090
I'm just saying.

595
01:05:46.261 --> 01:05:47.968
- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.


596
01:05:48.137 --> 01:05:52.131
Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.


597
01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:57.181
You gotta do stuff like that.

598
01:05:57.355 --> 01:05:58.845
There's something here.

599
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.391
I can feel it.

600
01:06:05.905 --> 01:06:07.771
She wants me to have it.

601
01:06:10.618 --> 01:06:11.949
Oh, that should do it.

602
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.282
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.


603
01:06:58.583 --> 01:07:00.620
It's time to sleep.

604
01:07:13.264 --> 01:07:15.505
I know this slip.

605
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:18.345
- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.


606
01:07:18.519 --> 01:07:20.977
Please, let me go. I beg you.

607
01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:22.892
There you go.

608
01:07:24.484 --> 01:07:26.521
Please, let me go.

609
01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:29.277
I promise I won't tell.

610
01:07:29.447 --> 01:07:31.654
Please, let me...

611
01:08:03.898 --> 01:08:05.229
Did you hear that?

612
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.311
Hear what?

613
01:08:11.989 --> 01:08:14.902
- My brother doesn't believe you're here.
- Christian!


614
01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.452
There's someone in the laundry.

615
01:08:30.883 --> 01:08:32.965
There's no one here.

616
01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:36.716
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it.


617
01:08:55.575 --> 01:08:56.610
Goodbye, Anna.

618
01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:07.663
She wasn't dead.

619
01:09:10.339 --> 01:09:13.582
My father did the exact
same thing that Garza did.

620
01:09:14.427 --> 01:09:17.419
The woman I saw in
this house all those years ago...

621
01:09:18.264 --> 01:09:20.380
...she was alive.

622
01:09:23.978 --> 01:09:26.094
I could have helped her.

623
01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.772
I let him kill her.

624
01:10:33.214 --> 01:10:35.376
Take this thing off.

625
01:10:36.342 --> 01:10:37.707
Okay.

626
01:11:03.786 --> 01:11:05.117
Her death was my fault.

627
01:11:07.081 --> 01:11:10.290
Until I free her
from wherever he put her...

628
01:11:11.002 --> 01:11:13.289
...she's trapped in the dark.

629
01:11:14.505 --> 01:11:16.087
Lost.

630
01:11:17.258 --> 01:11:18.293
I'm going in there.

631
01:11:19.468 --> 01:11:20.833
Stand back.

632
01:11:26.684 --> 01:11:28.516
Go for it.

633
01:11:28.686 --> 01:11:30.302
I'm good.

634
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:23.613
I'm sorry, Anna.

635
01:12:26.827 --> 01:12:28.317
I failed you.

636
01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:18.664
Oh, my God.

637
01:13:25.803 --> 01:13:27.009
Where you going?

638
01:13:27.513 --> 01:13:28.844
Elise.

639
01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:31.172
Elise.

640
01:13:51.787 --> 01:13:53.277
Elise.

641
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.912
You weren't the only one, Anna.

642
01:15:23.295 --> 01:15:25.252
- Audrey!
- Elise?


643
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.211
<i>Audrey.</i>

644
01:15:31.011 --> 01:15:32.217
<i>Audrey.</i>

645
01:15:32.388 --> 01:15:33.970
Elise.

646
01:15:34.682 --> 01:15:36.468
Where am I?

647
01:15:36.976 --> 01:15:39.559
You're in a special place...

648
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:42.103
...where the spirits go.

649
01:15:42.273 --> 01:15:44.105
Who are you?

650
01:15:46.277 --> 01:15:49.065
I'm a friend.

651
01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.775
I don't wanna be here.

652
01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:53.906
I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

653
01:15:59.331 --> 01:16:00.412
Elise...

654
01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:04.250
...no matter what your daddy says...

655
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.754
...you have to go
on doing what you do.

656
01:16:08.424 --> 01:16:12.008
Never be afraid of your ability.

657
01:16:16.891 --> 01:16:19.929
Daddy doesn't mean it
when he yells at me.

658
01:16:20.936 --> 01:16:22.051
He's scared...

659
01:16:23.314 --> 01:16:25.806
...of the man with the keys.

660
01:16:25.983 --> 01:16:28.645
He's the one controlling it all.

661
01:16:28.819 --> 01:16:31.561
He's the one who opens all the doors.

662
01:16:35.075 --> 01:16:39.114
- He opens all the red doors?
- Yes.


663
01:16:39.288 --> 01:16:42.326
The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.

664
01:16:42.499 --> 01:16:45.036
He says he wants me
to help him open every door.

665
01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:47.703
He says he'll do anything
it takes to get me.

666
01:16:50.382 --> 01:16:52.214
He's standing right behind you.

667
01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:55.251
<i>No!</i>

668
01:16:55.429 --> 01:16:58.217
Leave this place!

669
01:17:04.396 --> 01:17:07.184
Elise, wake up.

670
01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:09.728
Elise!

671
01:17:11.528 --> 01:17:13.314
Specs!

672
01:17:13.906 --> 01:17:15.192
I need help!

673
01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:19.025
Here, here. Careful with her head.

674
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:22.871
- She's on the other side.
- Somebody has to go in.


675
01:17:22.957 --> 01:17:25.790
Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?


676
01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.325
- I didn't say...
- I can do it.


677
01:17:30.464 --> 01:17:31.704
I can help her.

678
01:17:31.882 --> 01:17:35.466
I've never actually hypnotized anybody before.

679
01:17:35.636 --> 01:17:37.422
I've never been hypnotized.

680
01:17:37.596 --> 01:17:40.088
Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?

681
01:17:46.146 --> 01:17:47.511
Okay.

682
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.229
The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.


683
01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:53.814
E.T.

684
01:17:55.239 --> 01:17:56.855
Imogen.

685
01:17:57.032 --> 01:17:58.318
That's pretty cool.

686
01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.699
Just look here.

687
01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:03.862
And concentrate on it and just relax.

688
01:18:04.707 --> 01:18:08.621
Imagine that your body is made
of water and you're in the ocean.

689
01:18:08.794 --> 01:18:10.455
That doesn't make sense.

690
01:18:11.171 --> 01:18:12.957
- What?
- She's made of water...


691
01:18:13.132 --> 01:18:16.420
...and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.


692
01:18:16.969 --> 01:18:18.926
Would you like to do this?

693
01:18:23.684 --> 01:18:26.267
- Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> still be here.


694
01:18:26.437 --> 01:18:28.519
- Don't touch the subject.
- I'm not.


695
01:18:28.689 --> 01:18:30.396
Move away.

696
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:49.122
Close your eyes.

697
01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:53.082
Listen to the ticking.

698
01:18:53.255 --> 01:18:55.166
Focus on it.

699
01:18:55.674 --> 01:18:58.291
I'm going to count back from five.

700
01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:03.555
By the time I reach
one, you will be hypnotized.

701
01:19:04.099 --> 01:19:06.636
Five, four...

702
01:19:07.644 --> 01:19:12.229
...three, two, one.

703
01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.982
Nod if you can hear me.

704
01:19:19.782 --> 01:19:23.195
When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...

705
01:19:23.369 --> 01:19:27.078
...and you will be on the other side.

706
01:19:30.793 --> 01:19:32.625
<i>Now.</i>

707
01:19:55.484 --> 01:19:57.942
Wanna go there.

708
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.507
I'll help you.

709
01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:06.502
Red door.

710
01:21:07.806 --> 01:21:09.171
Red door.

711
01:21:09.349 --> 01:21:11.932
That's the red door Elise was talking about.

712
01:21:12.853 --> 01:21:15.220
This is the place.

713
01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:44.256
I can't go in there.

714
01:21:44.426 --> 01:21:46.667
If he finds me, he'll...

715
01:21:47.346 --> 01:21:49.508
He'll take me again.

716
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:52.890
Trust me. You'll find what
you're looking for in there.

717
01:21:56.438 --> 01:21:57.849
<i>I admit it!</i>

718
01:21:58.023 --> 01:21:59.605
<i>Shut up!</i>

719
01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:02.642
<i>That's right!</i>

720
01:22:03.737 --> 01:22:05.319
Elise?

721
01:22:07.366 --> 01:22:09.653
<i>The key is missing.</i>

722
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:13.698
<i>You're all gonna get it again!</i>

723
01:22:33.392 --> 01:22:36.635
<i>Do you ever think about the
people who go to the electric chair?</i>

724
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:39.060
<i>Sometimes.</i>

725
01:22:39.231 --> 01:22:41.814
<i>Do you wonder where they go?</i>

726
01:22:46.572 --> 01:22:48.688
<i>Your turn now.</i>

727
01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:23.480
<i>Look out, little girl!</i>

728
01:23:59.144 --> 01:24:02.978
<i>--always repeats, my friends.
The ghosts of their past...</i>


729
01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:08.601
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

730
01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:30.790
<i>If there's one thing you've been doing your whole life, 
Elise, it's ask for it.</i>

731
01:24:30.967 --> 01:24:33.834
No! No, Daddy!

732
01:24:34.012 --> 01:24:36.845
<i>They're all around us in this house.</i>

733
01:24:37.015 --> 01:24:38.346
<i>Everywhere.</i>

734
01:24:41.561 --> 01:24:44.724
<i>She needs to learn nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</i>

735
01:24:44.898 --> 01:24:47.185
Stop, Daddy, stop.

736
01:24:48.235 --> 01:24:51.068
<i>- No, Daddy, please.</i>
- Please, stop. No.


737
01:24:51.238 --> 01:24:52.899
- Stop.
<i>- No. No.</i>


738
01:24:53.073 --> 01:24:55.155
<i>No, Daddy!</i>

739
01:24:56.201 --> 01:24:57.720
<i>Some people are afraid of special people.</i>

740
01:24:57.744 --> 01:24:59.985
<i>Your daddy is one of them.</i>

741
01:25:03.834 --> 01:25:06.326
<i>I won't let you hurt me anymore.</i>

742
01:25:18.306 --> 01:25:20.047
<i>Did you see a ghost?</i>

743
01:25:20.225 --> 01:25:22.466
<i>Just say no. 
That's all you have to do.</i>

744
01:25:22.644 --> 01:25:26.057
<i>You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</i>


745
01:25:28.942 --> 01:25:30.353
You killed your mother.

746
01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:46.744
Elise.

747
01:25:49.212 --> 01:25:50.498
Elise!

748
01:25:54.509 --> 01:25:56.216
Elise!

749
01:25:57.888 --> 01:26:00.676
He's in my head. 
He's in my head.

750
01:26:01.057 --> 01:26:03.765
<i>My father did the
exact same thing as Garza.</i>

751
01:26:05.645 --> 01:26:09.639
My father was your puppet.

752
01:26:10.776 --> 01:26:15.270
I am not gonna feed
you with hatred anymore, demon.

753
01:26:15.447 --> 01:26:16.778
You can fucking starve.

754
01:26:19.201 --> 01:26:20.441
Elise!

755
01:26:20.952 --> 01:26:22.317
No!

756
01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:30.372
Leave her alone!
You wanna take somebody, take me.


757
01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:52.689
Let them go.

758
01:26:54.903 --> 01:26:56.064
<i>See now?</i>

759
01:27:07.082 --> 01:27:08.743
Honey? Honey?

760
01:27:08.917 --> 01:27:11.204
Nurse! Nurse, get in here!

761
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:14.002
Melissa!

762
01:27:22.138 --> 01:27:23.378
It's okay, it's okay.

763
01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:26.632
One, two, three, four.

764
01:27:37.821 --> 01:27:39.607
I'm sorry.

765
01:27:45.871 --> 01:27:46.986
No! No!

766
01:27:48.456 --> 01:27:52.950
No!

767
01:28:12.856 --> 01:28:14.346
Elise!

768
01:29:05.367 --> 01:29:07.233
Hands off my little girl.

769
01:29:43.822 --> 01:29:45.608
No, no, no.

770
01:29:45.782 --> 01:29:47.523
Elise!

771
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:49.442
She's hurt

772
01:30:29.784 --> 01:30:32.071
Return to your body. Go.

773
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:41.626
Baby.

774
01:30:42.297 --> 01:30:43.913
Oh, Dad.

775
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:46.502
Elise, she saved me.

776
01:31:10.283 --> 01:31:12.069
I don't know the words.

777
01:31:16.372 --> 01:31:18.704
I already know, my love.

778
01:31:25.757 --> 01:31:27.418
Keep helping people.

779
01:31:46.986 --> 01:31:48.727
Go home.

780
01:31:58.331 --> 01:32:00.538
Imogen, wake up!

781
01:32:01.668 --> 01:32:02.874
Are you okay?

782
01:32:03.044 --> 01:32:04.284
Yeah, I think so.

783
01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:10.333
You can't get rid of me that easy.
The hospital.


784
01:32:14.347 --> 01:32:19.717
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

785
01:32:22.313 --> 01:32:23.929
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.


786
01:32:24.107 --> 01:32:25.222
Hi.

787
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.936
I'm okay.

788
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:29.397
Oh, my God.

789
01:32:29.863 --> 01:32:31.353
Hi.

790
01:32:46.963 --> 01:32:48.670
I believe this is yours.

791
01:32:55.263 --> 01:32:56.879
You were right, Christian.

792
01:32:57.056 --> 01:32:58.592
I'm cursed.

793
01:32:58.766 --> 01:33:01.508
Demons follow me around.

794
01:33:02.645 --> 01:33:07.731
But I don't want to give them
what they want for one second longer.

795
01:33:07.901 --> 01:33:10.939
Fear and pain is what feeds them.

796
01:33:12.197 --> 01:33:14.780
I'm the one that's been feeding them...

797
01:33:14.949 --> 01:33:17.441
...shutting you out all these years.

798
01:33:18.328 --> 01:33:19.944
You forgive me?

799
01:33:20.121 --> 01:33:22.237
I never should have left you.

800
01:33:29.797 --> 01:33:31.504
Thank you.

801
01:33:32.217 --> 01:33:33.799
Yes.

802
01:33:41.434 --> 01:33:43.095
Melissa...

803
01:33:43.269 --> 01:33:45.101
...you gonna eat that?

804
01:33:46.522 --> 01:33:47.978
Go for it.

805
01:33:51.653 --> 01:33:56.068
You know, I always thought
that I was afraid of dying...

806
01:33:57.116 --> 01:33:59.904
...but now I realize that I wasn't.

807
01:34:00.703 --> 01:34:02.785
I was afraid of dying...

808
01:34:02.956 --> 01:34:06.199
...before I truly had a family again.

809
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:09.668
Now I do.

810
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:11.790
Son of a...

811
01:34:12.465 --> 01:34:13.955
I told you not to park there.

812
01:34:14.133 --> 01:34:16.966
- Just saying, I did.
- Listen to your buddy.


813
01:34:17.804 --> 01:34:20.296
He gets the girl, 
I get the ticket?

814
01:34:21.641 --> 01:34:23.097
I'm riding shotgun.

815
01:34:23.268 --> 01:34:26.135
We'll have to come back
here to deal with that ticket.

816
01:35:10.648 --> 01:35:12.309
Dalton.

817
01:35:12.984 --> 01:35:16.067
Today was just so horrible.
I'm scared nothing's gonna change.


818
01:35:16.237 --> 01:35:17.568
It will.

819
01:35:18.156 --> 01:35:19.863
I promise you.

820
01:35:20.325 --> 01:35:22.441
<i>Just gotta give it time.</i>

821
01:35:42.972 --> 01:35:45.134
Oh, Dalton.

822
01:35:59.614 --> 01:36:00.649
Hello.

823
01:36:00.823 --> 01:36:04.487
<i>I'm so sorry for calling so late.
My name ls Lorraine.</i>


824
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:08.824
<i>You helped my family a long time
ago when my son was just a boy.</i>

825
01:36:08.998 --> 01:36:11.911
<i>And now the same thing
is happening to my grandson.</i>

826
01:36:12.085 --> 01:36:13.667
Dalton.

827
01:36:14.087 --> 01:36:15.452
<i>How did you know his name?</i>

828
01:36:16.506 --> 01:36:18.497
It's what I do.

829
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:22.797
Tell Josh I'll be there in the morning.

830
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:24.711
<i>Thank you.</i>

831
01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:27.631
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>
