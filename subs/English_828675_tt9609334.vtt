1
00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:55.999
You're up.

2
00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.868
Vivian.

3
00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:08.912
What should we do now?

4
00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:10.582
We'll take her to Artist.

5
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.663
Who made you?

6
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.566
Nobody.

7
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:06.438
Liar. God made you.

8
00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:09.973
When you were struck down on the
side of the road, I found you.


9
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.246
I raised you up.
Gave you glory.


10
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.350
The world has mistreated you.
I can see that.


11
00:04:21.853 --> 00:04:23.987
You've been abandoned.

12
00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:26.491
I... I left.

13
00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.129
You could be home.

14
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.969
I've seen your salvation
in the waters.


15
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.144
Take you back...

16
00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.481
if you want.

17
00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:51.649
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow.


18
00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:54.385
Long trip.

19
00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.187
Meantime, come eat with us.

20
00:04:57.988 --> 00:04:59.089
You hungry?

21
00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:02.393
No.

22
00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:07.599
That is a damn lie.

23
00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:29.019
You have beautiful hair.

24
00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:31.188
Thank you.

25
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:39.264
Hey now.

26
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.634
Artist says, "Fear and
struggle put the devil in us.


27
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.869
- You believe in the devil don't you?
- Yeah.


28
00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:54.512
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:58.016
For whatever happened.
You shouldn't be afraid here.


30
00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:00.985
Not even the devil?

31
00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:15.500
Safer than that fancy
store bought stuff.


32
00:06:15.867 --> 00:06:16.701
Begone.

33
00:06:22.072 --> 00:06:23.308
How many months?

34
00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:25.677
Since winter.

35
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.579
- Three months after Ed saved me.
- Who is Ed?


36
00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.681
Uh, Artist. Sorry.

37
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.484
It kick?

38
00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.786
Not much. He's picky.

39
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.323
How do you know it's a he?

40
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.258
Well he has to be,
he is the son of God.


41
00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:44.796
Mil? Murph?
Find those carrots?


42
00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:53.037
Saratoga, grab some carrots
from the cellar.


43
00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:56.741
- We're talking.
- I don't care. I need help making dinner.


44
00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:00.979
No, it's okay. I got it.

45
00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:03.715
Oh, thank you.

46
00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:13.284
Mil, what?

47
00:08:13.317 --> 00:08:15.520
She needs a clean rag.
She's red.


48
00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:17.321
Don't say that.
Not over dinner.


49
00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:19.691
- She'll stain the dress.
- I can't help it.


50
00:08:24.228 --> 00:08:25.697
Take your plate.

51
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.465
Just for tonight.

52
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:29.600
Excuse me.

53
00:08:36.607 --> 00:08:38.009
Lydia.

54
00:08:38.743 --> 00:08:39.911
Would you like to say grace?

55
00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:42.580
Uh...

56
00:08:42.613 --> 00:08:45.550
I can't remember the prayer.
I'm sorry, I would.


57
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:48.720
Start talking. 
Just let it come.

58
00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:52.223
Okay.

59
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.205
Always say a prayer

60
00:09:06.237 --> 00:09:09.173
when an ambulance passes by
with its lights on.


61
00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:12.243
Because it wouldn't be
going that fast,


62
00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:14.078
unless someone
was fighting real hard.


63
00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.781
So...

64
00:09:16.814 --> 00:09:19.684
Lord, protect the
people in ambulances.


65
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.756
Amen.

66
00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.558
Amen.

67
00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:35.166
That was lovely, honey.
But there is no ambulances around here.


68
00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:39.537
Let's dig in.

69
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.540
- Carrots look lovely.
- They're Murphs.


70
00:09:42.573 --> 00:09:44.375
Good job, Firefly.

71
00:09:52.617 --> 00:09:54.051
See how he's doing.

72
00:09:59.857 --> 00:10:03.728
<i>♪ Steal away, steal away ♪</i>

73
00:10:05.163 --> 00:10:08.065
<i>♪ Steal away to Jesus ♪</i>

74
00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:13.938

76
00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.651
Fine.

77
00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.787
It's quiet.

78
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.428
Try it. Sing to him.

79
00:10:38.796 --> 00:10:40.665
See if he responds.
He's a...


80
00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:43.601
...good judge of people.

81
00:10:43.634 --> 00:10:45.002
Okay.

82
00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:07.491
Uh, I hear him.

83
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:11.662
I hear it.

84
00:11:12.864 --> 00:11:16.033
He's kicking.
Do you hear that?


85
00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:19.537
He's tapping back
the tune.


86
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.072
It's beautiful.

87
00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:12.723
Move over.

88
00:12:23.302 --> 00:12:25.069
Sleep, demons.

89
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.478
Hush.

90
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.053
He loves me.

91
00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:45.257
He does.

92
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.428
He's keeping you
upright and away from sin.


93
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.864
He sure beats the needle, huh?

94
00:12:55.032 --> 00:12:56.901
He don't love me anymore.

95
00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.339
Do you love him?

96
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.441
Mmm-hmm.

97
00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:04.608
That's all that matters.

98
00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:18.689
Lyd.

99
00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:25.263
Now that you're saved,
we can be sisters.


100
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:28.367
Thank you.

101
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.835
I think I might need to go back.

102
00:13:31.535 --> 00:13:34.239
Can I ask you're in from?

103
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.807
Dad died. I don't have a mommy.

104
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:41.078
We love you and we want
to honor you.


105
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:45.350
It would kill me to see you burn in
hell, so stay a day longer.


106
00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.556
Hey...

107
00:13:53.057 --> 00:13:54.525
Are you a virgin?

108
00:13:56.194 --> 00:13:57.828
- Yeah.
- Me too.


109
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.033
Vivian's not.

110
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:44.276
Hey, what's up.

111
00:14:45.243 --> 00:14:46.378
Hey.

112
00:14:49.247 --> 00:14:50.648
You wanna see my telescope?

113
00:14:54.985 --> 00:14:56.388
Uh...

114
00:14:57.788 --> 00:14:59.491
Sure.

115
00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:50.875
I used to be a pilot.

116
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.344
You were?

117
00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:54.778
Called me the "Midnight Rider."

118
00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:58.015
Cause I only flew at night.

119
00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.085
Up there you can swim
in the stars.


120
00:16:05.022 --> 00:16:05.990
Why did you quit?

121
00:16:12.129 --> 00:16:13.864
I'm not meant
for their machines.


122
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.469
Stars are clean.

123
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.171
Pure. I like them.

124
00:16:22.407 --> 00:16:25.109
Maybe just seem that way
cause you can't touch them.


125
00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:34.486
See for yourself.

126
00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:50.502
I can't see a thing.

127
00:16:51.403 --> 00:16:52.803
Squint.

128
00:16:54.372 --> 00:16:55.873
Wow.

129
00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:00.110
Who made the stars?

130
00:17:01.946 --> 00:17:03.881
I could tell you.

131
00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:06.384
I wasn't asking.
I was wondering.


132
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:11.356
Don't you want to know
how the world ends?


133
00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:16.026
How?

134
00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:21.165
Come to bed.

135
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.985
May I?

136
00:17:53.163 --> 00:17:54.566
Lyd?

137
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.635
Yeah?

138
00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:00.572
Can I ask your counsel?

139
00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:03.742
Mmm-hmm.

140
00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:08.680
I'm worried about the baby.

141
00:18:10.682 --> 00:18:12.082
I think it's in danger.

142
00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:15.819
Why?

143
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.591
We...

144
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:22.427
lost the last one.

145
00:18:25.162 --> 00:18:26.331
It ain't been the same.

146
00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:30.502
It tore us from...

147
00:18:35.607 --> 00:18:39.711
Sara's wasn't kicking
till you showed up.


148
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.516
You got glory.

149
00:18:48.952 --> 00:18:50.588
Having you here has been...

150
00:18:54.024 --> 00:18:55.993
a little breeze on my soul.

To the Lord
we give our light.


160
00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:05.530
You have come to us
seeking absolution.


161
00:20:07.766 --> 00:20:11.803
They have highways of diamonds.

162
00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.573
That's okay,
we got the light of the Lord.


163
00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:26.016
Don't be afraid.

164
00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:27.786
Join us.

165
00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:30.388
You will be baptized and reborn.

166
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.298
My first.

167
00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:18.168
There is not enough
room left in the bed.


168
00:21:21.171 --> 00:21:22.574
Oh?

169
00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:26.311
It barely worked
with four.


170
00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:29.681
If you want another
we need more space.


171
00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:32.650
Want?

172
00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:34.219
Desire has nothing
to do with it.


173
00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:37.856
The Lord
has sent us a lamb.


174
00:21:52.904 --> 00:21:55.607
- Hey, Angel.
- Hey, you going to the water?


175
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.443
- Yeah.
- I had another dream.


176
00:21:58.476 --> 00:22:01.178
- Another?
- The water swallowed us up.


177
00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:04.114
It's a dream. How is he?

178
00:22:05.216 --> 00:22:07.084
- Right.
- Good.


179
00:22:16.427 --> 00:22:17.962
Hey, Viv.

180
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:22.065
- Artist was looking for his cigarettes.
- I don't smoke.


181
00:22:23.368 --> 00:22:28.038
- You don't? Help me, child.
- I'm going to the water.


182
00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:31.342
- We have work.
- Prayer is work. Says Artist.


183
00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:36.548
Okay, thank you.

184
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.886
Murph.

185
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.489
Viv in the kitchen.

186
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:03.173
- Praying?
- Yes, Artist.


187
00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:05.710
- Don't let the devil tame ya.
- I won't.


188
00:23:07.077 --> 00:23:09.347
- Have you seen Mil?
- No.


189
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.249
- Tell me if you do, you hear?
- I will.


190
00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:13.618
Good girl.

191
00:23:15.053 --> 00:23:16.588
It's either here, there
and in the air.


192
00:24:10.274 --> 00:24:11.576
Want a drag?

193
00:24:12.677 --> 00:24:14.746
I don't smoke.

194
00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:16.748
- Found them.
- You stole them.


195
00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:20.251
He caught me once.

196
00:24:21.986 --> 00:24:24.154
Plucked the cigarette right
out of my mouth and did this.


197
00:24:29.293 --> 00:24:30.461
Please don't tell him.

198
00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:33.865
- Only if you give 'em back.
- I will.


199
00:24:36.467 --> 00:24:37.969
Promise.

200
00:24:41.472 --> 00:24:42.807
He's no good.

201
00:24:43.374 --> 00:24:44.776
He healed me.

202
00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:47.712
When Viv got pregnant he
gave her a homemade medicine.


203
00:24:47.745 --> 00:24:49.947
- Near killed her.
- Liar.


204
00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:51.582
He only likes you
cause your new.


205
00:24:54.552 --> 00:24:55.520
Dear Lord in Heaven,

206
00:24:57.355 --> 00:25:01.626
please bless Artist, Dan,

207
00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:07.298
Sara, Vivian and Murph.

208
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:09.634
And God save the wicked.

209
00:25:10.601 --> 00:25:11.869
And Mil.

210
00:25:58.282 --> 00:25:59.917
Storm's coming.

211
00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:05.423
Saw it from a cliff.

212
00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:07.825
We don't go there alone,
it's dangerous.


213
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:09.260
Storm like my dream.

214
00:26:09.293 --> 00:26:10.862
- Yeah. Where's Ed?
- Upstairs.


215
00:26:10.895 --> 00:26:12.430
He's busy.

216
00:26:12.463 --> 00:26:14.899
- I knew it.
- Help me with dinner.


217
00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:16.701
For sure, one sec, I'm gonna go
talk to Artist, we gotta board


218
00:26:16.734 --> 00:26:19.070
up the windows,
coop the chicken...


219
00:26:19.103 --> 00:26:21.539
- I need you to help me.
- I will.


220
00:26:24.942 --> 00:26:26.144
Come look.

221
00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:29.248
There's a storm.

222
00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:38.956
We gotta board up the windows.

223
00:26:40.825 --> 00:26:42.860
Viv, coop the chicken.

224
00:26:47.365 --> 00:26:51.169
"And the serpent cast out of his
mouth a flood, after the women.


225
00:26:52.804 --> 00:26:54.405
"That he might drown them."

226
00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:00.645
What have we done
to deserve this?


227
00:27:21.499 --> 00:27:22.867
Oops! Sorry!

228
00:27:40.219 --> 00:27:41.786
Maybe it's good
there is a storm.


229
00:27:53.898 --> 00:27:56.067
Would anyone
like to confess a sin?


230
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:08.112
Millie?

231
00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:12.817
What's wrong?

232
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.823
Your eyes are bright.
Normally there are dull.


233
00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:23.228
Something's wrong.

234
00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:31.303
I had a dream
that I shoplifted.


235
00:28:34.071 --> 00:28:36.007
I'm so sorry.

236
00:28:40.978 --> 00:28:44.548
That's all right.
You'll do better.


237
00:28:44.582 --> 00:28:46.484
Hmm...

238
00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:52.224
Mil?

239
00:28:54.792 --> 00:28:56.228
Nothing.

240
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.897
That's not a confession.

241
00:29:03.402 --> 00:29:05.169
I have a confession.

242
00:29:06.971 --> 00:29:09.106
My cigarettes are missing.

243
00:29:11.442 --> 00:29:15.947
They were right there.
On the table.


244
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:20.352
I wonder...

245
00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:24.088
The devil take them?

246
00:29:27.024 --> 00:29:28.427
Now...

247
00:29:30.127 --> 00:29:33.864
I don't believe the
devil likes cigarettes.


248
00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.235
He don't need to steal.

249
00:29:39.804 --> 00:29:42.006
He moves through us.

250
00:29:42.773 --> 00:29:46.311
Finds weak little girls.

251
00:29:47.144 --> 00:29:49.247
To do his bidding.

252
00:29:50.114 --> 00:29:53.751
And steal my goddamn cigarettes!

253
00:29:57.722 --> 00:29:59.156
Did you hear that?

254
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.658
Hell...

255
00:30:02.893 --> 00:30:04.695
Let's check around.

256
00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:48.839
Where's Millie?

257
00:30:51.142 --> 00:30:52.710
I'll check the yard.
Y'all look around the house.


258
00:30:58.383 --> 00:31:00.084
I'm cold.

259
00:31:02.254 --> 00:31:04.389
- Lyd?
- Hmm?


260
00:31:04.423 --> 00:31:06.391
Did you take the cigarettes?

261
00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:08.260
What?

262
00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:26.238
She was an innocent girl.

263
00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:30.275
Beautiful and pure.

264
00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:35.146
- She was strayin'.
- Shut up!


265
00:32:37.715 --> 00:32:39.850
The devil made her jump.

266
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:52.163
Like I said.

267
00:33:03.475 --> 00:33:08.679
Canning's spoilt. Cellar's flooded.
Chicken's dead.


268
00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:13.451
Damn. We're in thick.

269
00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:16.720
What God does this?

270
00:33:17.355 --> 00:33:18.290
Wasn't no God.

271
00:33:19.591 --> 00:33:20.858
We wished in the devil.

272
00:33:23.528 --> 00:33:25.796
We need more food.
We should go ashore.


273
00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:27.566
No, one thing at a time.

274
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.537
We got a burial to attend.

275
00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:36.173
- Someone should go fishing.
- I'll go.


276
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.611
Good. Bring Sara.

277
00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:43.747
- She's scared sick.
- Yes, Artist.


278
00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:45.383
Don't want nobody alone
when the devil's afoot.


279
00:33:47.184 --> 00:33:48.185
Viv...

280
00:33:49.753 --> 00:33:52.890
Butcher the chicken,
that meat will spoil.


281
00:33:52.923 --> 00:33:55.660
Take the boards off the windows too.
It's grim.


282
00:33:55.694 --> 00:33:57.529
The Lord don't like
a frown, you hear?


283
00:34:03.235 --> 00:34:04.436
Make sweet.

284
00:34:30.562 --> 00:34:32.597
You're all hunched over.

285
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:34.699
- Will you give me a massage?
- Of course.


286
00:34:46.278 --> 00:34:48.613
- You're strong.
- Thank you.


287
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.584
Ed says we're supposed
to be meek,


288
00:34:52.617 --> 00:34:55.453
- but I meant it as a compliment.
- I know you did.


289
00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:02.826
This place reminds me
of the pageant circuit.


290
00:35:10.669 --> 00:35:13.672
Bet your hair was taller then.

291
00:35:13.705 --> 00:35:16.940
Hair four feet tall,
heels to the moon...


292
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.512
and a dress that
rustled like the ocean.


293
00:35:20.545 --> 00:35:22.247
- Don't crane your neck.
- Sorry.


294
00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:29.621
So how long
were you a beauty queen?


295
00:35:32.022 --> 00:35:34.559
When I moved in with my aunt,

296
00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:37.462
she said, "Saratoga,
you have to make something of yourself."


297
00:35:37.495 --> 00:35:39.497
After your parents passed?

298
00:35:45.737 --> 00:35:47.339
Ed says they're gone to hell.

299
00:35:49.341 --> 00:35:50.809
He ain't right about everything.

300
00:35:52.677 --> 00:35:54.044
He is.

301
00:35:58.216 --> 00:36:00.285
They're in hell and I've made
my peace with it.


302
00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:14.998
Really.

303
00:36:23.742 --> 00:36:25.543
Can we go to the water now?

304
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.855
Do you think Viv likes me?

305
00:36:38.188 --> 00:36:40.090
She loves you.

306
00:36:40.124 --> 00:36:41.925
Yeah, but does she like me?

307
00:36:43.361 --> 00:36:45.028
You have God's son.

308
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.367
Yeah, I know.

309
00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:52.537
Maybe she wishes she were you.

310
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:58.343
Come on, the water cheers me up.

311
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.464
Sorry about the chicken.

312
00:37:20.398 --> 00:37:21.566
It wasn't your fault.

313
00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:27.872
Ugh, that smell.
I'm gonna go take a walk.


314
00:37:27.906 --> 00:37:31.008
- Okay, be careful.
- Love you.

Lyd!

324
00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:19.824
He's a sinner.
He is from the mainland.


325
00:38:19.858 --> 00:38:22.694
- Ed says...
- He is young, if we leave him he'll die.


326
00:38:22.727 --> 00:38:24.462
Wait, you wanna take him?

327
00:38:33.838 --> 00:38:35.306
Help!

328
00:38:50.421 --> 00:38:51.456
Hold!

329
00:38:54.325 --> 00:38:56.194
He ain't a threat.
He needs help.


330
00:38:56.227 --> 00:38:58.630
We found him down by the beach.

331
00:38:58.663 --> 00:39:00.665
Today of all days,
you found him?


332
00:39:01.332 --> 00:39:02.734
He ain't a straight dog.

333
00:39:03.902 --> 00:39:05.803
Sara, come here.

334
00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:09.974
We've had enough
death today, right?


335
00:39:14.412 --> 00:39:15.613
Sara?

336
00:39:16.714 --> 00:39:18.216
Sara?

337
00:39:18.249 --> 00:39:20.351
Lyd, we made a mistake.

338
00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:24.756
Ed!

339
00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:28.526
- Ed!
- Don't get above your raisin.


340
00:39:29.092 --> 00:39:31.462
Ed!

341
00:39:31.496 --> 00:39:33.831
Murph, what did I say to you
about running around corners?


342
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.338
Shit!

343
00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:42.674
What now?

344
00:39:42.707 --> 00:39:44.909
We found him down
by the beach near dead.


345
00:39:47.245 --> 00:39:50.448
Let him die. Safer.

346
00:39:50.481 --> 00:39:54.752
"Carry each other's burdens and in this
way you will fulfill the law of Christ."


347
00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:57.388
Don't you get biblical with me.

348
00:39:57.422 --> 00:40:01.859
The devil prowls around like a
roaring lion seeking to devour.


349
00:40:01.893 --> 00:40:04.696
This man maybe the devil
himself clad in rags.


350
00:40:04.729 --> 00:40:08.766
As Christian souls we are bound to help this
man for this is the law of the prophets.


351
00:40:19.243 --> 00:40:20.645
Ed, please!

352
00:40:23.581 --> 00:40:24.515
Poor man.

353
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.054
He's a boy.

354
00:40:34.792 --> 00:40:36.628
You vouch for him?

355
00:40:36.661 --> 00:40:38.161
With all your soul?

356
00:40:38.863 --> 00:40:39.964
I do.

357
00:40:42.834 --> 00:40:44.268
Fine.

358
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.738
Go put him in the living room.

359
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.342
You're gonna
ruin the goddamn carpet!


360
00:41:23.007 --> 00:41:24.976
Everything's slipping.

361
00:41:25.009 --> 00:41:26.644
Didn't even get a chance
to bury Mil.


362
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:33.151
This will cover some canned
goods, medicines, cigarettes.


363
00:41:33.183 --> 00:41:34.719
We got cigarettes.

364
00:41:36.387 --> 00:41:38.256
I'm not going back.

365
00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:40.024
Viv?

366
00:41:40.058 --> 00:41:42.060
Would that be the Lord compelling
you or the dead girl in the basement?


367
00:41:44.495 --> 00:41:47.365
Viv, help me get his socks off?

368
00:41:48.866 --> 00:41:50.735
Excuse me.

369
00:42:03.181 --> 00:42:07.185
Lord, keep us
on this day faithful.


370
00:42:07.218 --> 00:42:10.188
And dry from sin.

371
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:12.690
And let us not
forget the blessings we have.

372
00:42:16.127 --> 00:42:17.395
Dammit!

373
00:42:18.563 --> 00:42:20.364
I'm saying grace.

374
00:42:20.398 --> 00:42:22.867
Used to be order around here,
now we're two shakes away from sodomy.


375
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.636
I'll be right back,
it's just he is feverish and...


376
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.004
Go.

377
00:42:30.274 --> 00:42:31.876
Burn with him.

378
00:42:37.548 --> 00:42:39.016
Don't get too friendly.

379
00:42:41.052 --> 00:42:43.755
What's up?

380
00:42:43.788 --> 00:42:46.724
- Uh, nothing.
- Looks like that.


381
00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:03.908
- Shit.
- Language please.


382
00:43:05.777 --> 00:43:07.111
Sorry.

383
00:43:11.616 --> 00:43:13.252
Thanks.

384
00:43:22.493 --> 00:43:23.961
So...

385
00:43:24.796 --> 00:43:26.497
What's you name?

386
00:43:27.266 --> 00:43:28.800
Lydia.

387
00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:30.001
Oh?

388
00:43:30.735 --> 00:43:32.770
You're Lyd?

389
00:43:32.804 --> 00:43:34.338
I whisper about you.

390
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:37.842
Are you uh...

391
00:43:38.976 --> 00:43:40.444
- Special?
- Stop being a dick.


392
00:43:47.084 --> 00:43:50.255
See, I knew you guys
didn't really talk like that.


393
00:43:50.289 --> 00:43:51.522
Like what?

394
00:43:52.323 --> 00:43:53.157
All Bible-ly.

395
00:43:54.158 --> 00:43:56.295
I haven't been here long.

396
00:43:56.327 --> 00:43:59.497
Hopefully, I won't be either.

397
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.667
My boat probably washed up
somewhere downshore.


398
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:05.469
I'll find it...

399
00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:13.245
Hey, can I ask you something?

400
00:44:13.278 --> 00:44:15.813
- Prefer you didn't.
- The pregnant girl...


401
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:18.416
- Is she 18?
- Don't.


402
00:44:18.449 --> 00:44:20.017
- What?
- Talk like that.


403
00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:22.653
- Why?
- Because you're a guest.


404
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.895
He's had his drink.

405
00:44:43.541 --> 00:44:45.877
- Christian?
- Sir.


406
00:44:48.412 --> 00:44:50.448
Believe in the devil?

407
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.251
Lately.

408
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.656
That's an interesting
group you got here.


409
00:45:00.424 --> 00:45:02.261
You must be drowning in it.

410
00:45:08.866 --> 00:45:10.868
Yeah?

411
00:45:12.003 --> 00:45:13.037
Brought you something.

412
00:45:13.704 --> 00:45:14.872
What's that?

413
00:45:14.906 --> 00:45:17.008
Greens from the garden, mostly.

414
00:45:17.775 --> 00:45:19.176
It will help you sleep.

415
00:46:05.189 --> 00:46:06.891
Ed?

416
00:46:16.401 --> 00:46:18.636
What did you give to me?
I can't breathe.


417
00:46:21.138 --> 00:46:22.441
Lyd!

418
00:46:24.475 --> 00:46:26.110
Devil! Devil!

419
00:46:38.223 --> 00:46:41.625
- Get away! Get away from me! Get away! Get away!
- Come on!


420
00:46:44.695 --> 00:46:45.963
You ain't real!

421
00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:13.392
<i>Heavenly father,
forgive us for we have sinned.</i>


422
00:47:15.427 --> 00:47:17.962
<i>Give us this today,
our daily bread.</i>


423
00:47:19.331 --> 00:47:23.734
Your will be done
on Earth as is in heaven.


424
00:47:27.772 --> 00:47:31.075
God, save Lydia.

425
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.415
For bringing that evil
man into our home.


426
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.851
He has brought
the devil to us.


427
00:47:41.919 --> 00:47:44.222
And perverted our household.

428
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.959
Amen.

429
00:47:50.961 --> 00:47:52.297
Amen.

430
00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.166
Sara! Sara!

431
00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:02.867
It's the devil
making me bleed.


432
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.204
- I can feel him in my throat.
- It was spotting.


433
00:49:06.238 --> 00:49:07.671
She's fine, she just panicked.

434
00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:09.673
It's the devil, I know it.

435
00:49:09.707 --> 00:49:14.246
He took your baby.
He made Millie go crazy.


436
00:49:14.279 --> 00:49:19.551
He made Lydia take that fisherman in
and now he's coming after my baby.


437
00:49:19.584 --> 00:49:21.486
- We found him together.
- You made me.


438
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.654
Sarah, you're fine,
it's normal.


439
00:49:23.687 --> 00:49:28.426
- Normal? Was it normal when the baby died in your belly?
- Hey!


440
00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.462
Don't you dare talk to me
like that.


441
00:49:30.495 --> 00:49:33.998
- I make your food. I am in charge of you.
- Shut up!


442
00:49:35.534 --> 00:49:36.700
All of you!

443
00:49:39.304 --> 00:49:42.541
This better get cleaned up.

444
00:49:42.574 --> 00:49:43.841
Or there's hell to pay.

445
00:49:44.942 --> 00:49:46.545
The devil is creeping.

446
00:49:51.516 --> 00:49:52.816
But the Lord will deliver us.

447
00:49:54.985 --> 00:49:57.788
- If we fall in line.
- Ed, please!


448
00:50:00.525 --> 00:50:02.394
Let's get you
some fresh clothes.


449
00:51:29.146 --> 00:51:30.415
Where you going?

450
00:51:31.616 --> 00:51:33.518
To use the bathroom.

451
00:51:33.984 --> 00:51:35.420
Why?

452
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.458
Why am I using the bathroom?

453
00:51:48.366 --> 00:51:50.368
Murph, go with her.

454
00:51:54.472 --> 00:51:55.939
Okay.

455
00:52:15.493 --> 00:52:17.429
How you feeling?

456
00:52:17.462 --> 00:52:19.830
- Not hungry.
- Eat, baby, please.


457
00:52:24.703 --> 00:52:26.338
Is he dead?

458
00:52:27.739 --> 00:52:29.374
No. No.

459
00:52:44.222 --> 00:52:45.724
Here, honey.

460
00:52:45.757 --> 00:52:47.991
This will help you sleep
and heal you up.


461
00:52:50.328 --> 00:52:51.296
What's in it?

462
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.798
The Lord's Prayer.

463
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:06.344
Good girl.

464
00:53:07.746 --> 00:53:09.347
Viv, uh...

465
00:53:10.948 --> 00:53:14.184
- Ed's a good one, isn't he?
- Sure is.


466
00:53:22.427 --> 00:53:25.296
Ugh, feel so sick.

467
00:53:26.331 --> 00:53:28.098
Maybe you need a doctor?

468
00:53:29.734 --> 00:53:33.538
- We could take you to a hospital?
- I have my shepherd.


469
00:53:36.408 --> 00:53:38.142
You should be
more grateful, Lyd.


470
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.249
You know, maybe for good
we can make God smile again.


471
00:53:47.352 --> 00:53:48.853
Maybe.

472
00:53:53.792 --> 00:53:55.959
- I'll be back.
- Lyd?


473
00:53:57.896 --> 00:54:00.198
Don't do anything stupid
like you always do.


474
00:54:17.782 --> 00:54:19.284
Come here.

475
00:54:22.454 --> 00:54:24.121
Artist.

476
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:28.893
I've been thinking.

477
00:54:32.664 --> 00:54:34.265
Uh-oh.

478
00:54:34.933 --> 00:54:36.568
Sara's sick.

479
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:40.170
She's not gonna get better.
Not here on this island.


480
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.010
Is that a threat?

481
00:54:47.044 --> 00:54:50.113
Wouldn't Lord want
a healthy messiah child?


482
00:54:54.452 --> 00:54:56.588
- You don't smell like your daddy.
- What?


483
00:54:57.655 --> 00:54:59.990
Did your daddy drink?

484
00:55:00.023 --> 00:55:02.627
Did you come out here
to hide out?


485
00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.162
You found me, you brought me.

486
00:55:05.196 --> 00:55:06.997
You wanted it.

487
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.710
Go. Pray.

488
00:55:21.044 --> 00:55:22.514
Yes, Artist.

489
00:56:07.358 --> 00:56:09.727
Oh, God.

490
00:56:11.763 --> 00:56:13.464
Why did you make shadows?

491
00:56:17.969 --> 00:56:21.239
Why can't things only be bright?

492
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:28.646
I don't know.

493
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.951
My girls want me to fix
everything, but I can't


494
00:56:33.484 --> 00:56:36.654
fix sin.

495
00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:41.793
I can't fix their mistakes.

496
00:56:45.396 --> 00:56:48.098
Sometimes I get a feeling...

497
00:56:50.602 --> 00:56:52.036
like their shadows...

498
00:56:52.804 --> 00:56:54.772
in the corner of my eyes...

499
00:56:54.806 --> 00:56:58.009
like, their closing in.

500
00:57:00.778 --> 00:57:02.013
Coming to get me.

501
00:57:08.786 --> 00:57:09.988
Amen.

502
00:57:11.489 --> 00:57:12.323
Amen.

503
00:57:13.524 --> 00:57:14.559
Amen.

504
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.269
So, what's for dinner?

505
00:57:25.303 --> 00:57:27.405
All the supplies,
they'll be spoiled by tomorrow.


506
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.875
Plus the morning dove.

507
00:57:33.645 --> 00:57:35.013
Thanks, Murph.

508
00:57:36.214 --> 00:57:37.315
Let's dig in.

509
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.659
Ugh! Goddammit

510
00:57:49.861 --> 00:57:51.161
I suppose I have you to
thank for this.


511
00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:55.366
- It's not her fault.
- Things were okay till she showed up.


512
00:57:57.802 --> 00:57:59.137
Now we have two bodies
in the yard.


513
00:58:01.773 --> 00:58:03.074
I tried to help.

514
00:58:03.975 --> 00:58:05.143
You helped.

515
00:58:15.353 --> 00:58:18.456

Mercy!

525
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.558
What do you feel?

526
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:55.793
...putting through
me every hour.


527
00:58:55.827 --> 00:58:58.463
Every minute, he's not kicking.

528
00:58:58.496 --> 00:59:01.032
He's not kicking the way
he used to.


529
00:59:01.065 --> 00:59:03.367
- The devil.
- Which one of you is doing this to me?


530
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:06.671
Reveal thee, Satan!
I will strike you down!


531
00:59:12.677 --> 00:59:14.278
I wanna die.

532
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:19.784
I'm ready for heaven.

533
00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:25.757
Please don't.

534
00:59:28.693 --> 00:59:30.027
Leave me alone.

535
00:59:47.111 --> 00:59:49.847
Where is Ed?

536
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:53.518
- You're gonna give her more of that stuff?
- Your questions are harmful.


537
00:59:54.452 --> 00:59:55.987
Water...

538
00:59:58.422 --> 00:59:59.857
She wants some water.

539
01:00:32.723 --> 01:00:34.592
We're running out of cigarettes.

540
01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:37.628
Get some at the mainland.

541
01:00:37.662 --> 01:00:39.497
Take Sara with you,
bring her to a hospital.


542
01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:44.936
- I'm never going back.
- Sara is too sick to stay here.


543
01:00:47.038 --> 01:00:49.640
She needs rest. Prayer.

544
01:00:51.142 --> 01:00:52.476
You need to stop hovering.

545
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:54.846
- What if she dies?
- She's a martyr.


546
01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.049
If you had only been so lucky.

547
01:00:58.082 --> 01:00:59.984
- It's crazy...
- Crazy?


548
01:01:00.017 --> 01:01:02.687
These are holy words.
Who are you?


549
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.490
Some dumb
Kentucky slut knows better?


550
01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:09.627
You want me to save the baby?

551
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.030
I tell you what.
That baby is already dead. Viv told me.


552
01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.236
And if it ain't dead,
it's run afoul of God.


553
01:01:17.269 --> 01:01:18.369
Unnatural child.

554
01:01:18.402 --> 01:01:21.539
To some dumb girl seduced
by Satan.


555
01:01:21.572 --> 01:01:23.674
Don't you try to
link me to it.


556
01:01:26.377 --> 01:01:27.879
We'll start over.

557
01:01:30.014 --> 01:01:31.549
A new mother.

558
01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:34.418
Better.

559
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:37.889
Okay.

560
01:01:37.922 --> 01:01:39.924
You'd like to carry
the son of God, wouldn't you?


561
01:01:42.026 --> 01:01:43.661
It's an honor.

562
01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:51.535
- Lyd.
- Don't.


563
01:01:59.744 --> 01:02:02.046
Hey, what do you need?

564
01:02:04.482 --> 01:02:05.950
Lyd...

565
01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.488
Bury me in gowns.

566
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:12.623
- You're not dying.
- Yes, I am.


567
01:02:14.058 --> 01:02:15.426
Viv told me.

568
01:02:17.728 --> 01:02:20.665
Gotta stop taking their
medicine, it's not good for you.


569
01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:26.204
Come on, Sara. We gotta get out of here.
It's not safe.


570
01:02:27.406 --> 01:02:30.141
This is the only place
our souls are safe.


571
01:02:31.075 --> 01:02:33.577
- Where did you come from?
- Hell.


572
01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:38.250
I came from hell but I'm not going
back there either. Come on. Get up.


573
01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:44.021
You want my kid. You came here to destroy
us and now you wanna take my baby.


574
01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:46.090
- I don't trust you.
- Came from hell, huh?


575
01:02:51.662 --> 01:02:54.632
Get the fuck off me!

576
01:03:01.973 --> 01:03:03.241
Sara!

577
01:03:04.976 --> 01:03:06.445
Don't look, she'll harm you.

578
01:03:13.517 --> 01:03:15.253
Don't look. You'll go to hell.

579
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.223
- Sara!
- I mean it!


580
01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:19.890
Dammit! Go! Lie down!

581
01:03:46.884 --> 01:03:49.053
What's happening?

582
01:04:03.868 --> 01:04:06.003
Oh, my God!

583
01:04:07.339 --> 01:04:08.806
What are you doing?

584
01:04:11.243 --> 01:04:12.843
We need firewood.

585
01:04:12.877 --> 01:04:14.812
There are trees everywhere.

586
01:04:14.845 --> 01:04:19.850
I don't want to cut down trees.
It's not environmental.


587
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:27.058
Better go hunt for breakfast.

588
01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.727
We're all out of food.

589
01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:32.696
Unless you like maggots.

590
01:04:34.632 --> 01:04:37.001
Sara, you tend the garden.

591
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:40.905
- Me?
- What, you special?


592
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:49.214
Oh... Why?

593
01:04:51.082 --> 01:04:52.716
You still think
that's the messiah?


594
01:04:54.252 --> 01:04:55.986
The baby that makes you bleed.

595
01:04:59.023 --> 01:05:00.459
You ain't worth it.

596
01:05:02.126 --> 01:05:03.395
Just like Viv.

597
01:05:11.769 --> 01:05:14.339
- I wanna have my baby in a hospital.
- Shh!


598
01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:16.241
I wanna go home.

599
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.109
Home?

600
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.449
The world hates you.

601
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.786
No one is home on Earth.

602
01:05:29.653 --> 01:05:32.656
Your home is up there.

603
01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:38.330
Do you hear me?

604
01:07:24.569 --> 01:07:25.570
Lyd?

605
01:07:30.007 --> 01:07:31.175
Lyd?

606
01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:34.044
- Sara...
- I'm so sorry.


607
01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:18.290
I smell fresh meat.

608
01:08:54.592 --> 01:08:56.494
What do you want?

609
01:08:56.528 --> 01:08:59.531
I'm sorry. You upset him.

610
01:09:00.532 --> 01:09:01.999
He's a very sensitive man.

611
01:09:03.535 --> 01:09:06.136
Did he tell you
to come spy on me?


612
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:10.074
No, but he did ask me
to give you this.


613
01:09:31.429 --> 01:09:33.063
When did you know?

614
01:09:34.164 --> 01:09:37.202
That you lost yours?

615
01:09:39.437 --> 01:09:40.538
My baby?

616
01:09:46.745 --> 01:09:48.313
"Said Ruth,

617
01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:51.014
"'Where you go,
I will go.


618
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:54.885
"'Where you stay,
I will stay.


619
01:09:57.054 --> 01:09:59.758
"'Your people will
be my people.


620
01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.892
"'And your God will
be my God.


621
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:06.364
"' Where you die,
I will die.


622
01:10:07.532 --> 01:10:09.401
"'And there
I will be buried.'"


623
01:10:17.575 --> 01:10:19.377
The Bible is a great comfort.

624
01:10:22.913 --> 01:10:24.215
Do you hate me?

625
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:28.353
Oh, honey...

626
01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:33.258
I'm too tired to hate.

627
01:10:35.593 --> 01:10:37.060
Viv?

628
01:10:38.563 --> 01:10:40.365
- Yes, Artist.
- Come here.


629
01:10:45.236 --> 01:10:48.807
Drink your medicine.
It will bring you peace.


630
01:10:51.074 --> 01:10:52.444
I will.

631
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.869
Sara's taken
a turn for the worse.


632
01:11:50.902 --> 01:11:52.437
She could die by morning.

633
01:11:53.705 --> 01:11:55.105
Can I see her?

634
01:11:56.241 --> 01:11:57.976
Drink this.

635
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.913
- Why?
- Drink this.


636
01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:04.114
And I'll get Sara and
I'll bring her down.


637
01:12:04.147 --> 01:12:05.950
I'm not sick.

638
01:12:05.984 --> 01:12:08.653
It's different, please drink it.

639
01:12:08.686 --> 01:12:09.988
And I'll bring Sara down.

640
01:13:04.576 --> 01:13:06.076
Did I ever
tell you how we met?


641
01:13:08.346 --> 01:13:09.914
It was love at first sight.

642
01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:14.084
He was working at a carnival.

643
01:13:15.353 --> 01:13:17.388
Swallowing swords no less.

644
01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:22.226
He put a dagger down his
throat and he winked at me.


645
01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:27.365
That's not true.

646
01:13:29.567 --> 01:13:31.035
Well, what's true?

647
01:13:34.872 --> 01:13:35.974
It ain't a lie.

648
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.077
We were close to happy then.

649
01:13:40.177 --> 01:13:43.448
Before he got all... girl crazy.

650
01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:47.251
Where was this?

651
01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:52.090
Champaign.

652
01:13:54.124 --> 01:13:57.562
I wouldn't have taken
you for an Illinois girl.


653
01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:01.232
And how would you take
me, Kentucky girl?


654
01:14:02.066 --> 01:14:03.468
With a knife.

655
01:14:04.636 --> 01:14:07.772
First you, then him.

656
01:14:14.579 --> 01:14:17.649
What do you do when your
life sort of turns out wrong?


657
01:14:17.682 --> 01:14:19.350
You leave.

658
01:14:23.121 --> 01:14:25.923
No, that wouldn't
be fair to him.


659
01:14:27.325 --> 01:14:31.295
He needs me.
He'd be lost without me.


660
01:15:51.409 --> 01:15:52.710
Let go of me!

661
01:15:53.611 --> 01:15:54.579
What are you doing?

662
01:15:59.117 --> 01:16:00.585
She was trying to leave.

663
01:16:03.788 --> 01:16:05.556
- Is this true?
- I still love you.


664
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:08.626
I still love all of you
but we're going to die here.


665
01:16:08.659 --> 01:16:12.764
- Where would you go?
- Murphy, you can come stay with my aunt.


666
01:16:12.797 --> 01:16:14.665
She can help us take care
of the baby.


667
01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:16.801
You'd love her,
just come with me.


668
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:23.407
Sara.

669
01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:28.946
- Sara, are you in there?
- Of course.


670
01:16:30.348 --> 01:16:31.783
I ain't talking to you, devil.

671
01:16:34.552 --> 01:16:37.755
- Do you reject the devil?
- Of course.


672
01:16:37.789 --> 01:16:41.260
She'll cry,
but it don't make her holy.


673
01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.895
We're doing this for you, hon.

674
01:16:43.928 --> 01:16:46.597
Your soul can go
to the everlasting.


675
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:48.399
You don't wanna stay here.

676
01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.844
No! No!

677
01:18:06.878 --> 01:18:11.148
Light enters through
the wounds.


678
01:18:11.182 --> 01:18:15.220
A light has gone out.

679
01:18:15.254 --> 01:18:18.357
- I can see it in your face.
- I'm here.


680
01:18:19.991 --> 01:18:21.926
Silence, devil.

681
01:18:21.959 --> 01:18:23.828
I ain't talking to you.

682
01:18:25.663 --> 01:18:27.266
It's our baby.

683
01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:36.241
My son...

684
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.043
Is gonna raise mountains.

685
01:18:40.444 --> 01:18:42.281
And sink cities.

686
01:18:44.548 --> 01:18:48.185
Not make you sick.

687
01:18:48.619 --> 01:18:50.187
And bleed.

688
01:18:55.126 --> 01:18:58.529
You did this. It's yours.

689
01:19:03.935 --> 01:19:05.970
Murph, get me a towel.

690
01:19:10.741 --> 01:19:12.344
Two towels.

691
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.620
Murph.

692
01:19:27.191 --> 01:19:30.429
You weren't shit when I found
ya and you ain't shit now.


693
01:19:30.928 --> 01:19:32.264
Move.

694
01:19:34.098 --> 01:19:35.933
Please, Murph.

695
01:24:31.095 --> 01:24:35.866
Just wait till the baby
get born.


696
01:24:35.899 --> 01:24:37.369
And then you can kill me.

697
01:24:39.738 --> 01:24:42.940
- Did you fuck him?
- Who?


698
01:24:45.343 --> 01:24:47.279
- The fisherman. You liked him.
- What?


699
01:24:48.446 --> 01:24:51.750
Oh...

700
01:24:52.484 --> 01:24:55.553
Burn...

701
01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:00.492
You lost him.

702
01:25:04.962 --> 01:25:06.997
"Said Ruth,

703
01:25:07.965 --> 01:25:10.801
"'Where you'll go,
I'll go.


704
01:25:10.834 --> 01:25:15.039
"'Where you stay, I will stay,
where you die, I will die.


705
01:25:17.808 --> 01:25:19.977
"'And there
will I be buried.'"


706
01:25:22.846 --> 01:25:24.249
You're like Ruth.

707
01:25:25.317 --> 01:25:26.451
Artist.

708
01:25:28.286 --> 01:25:29.587
What?

709
01:25:30.854 --> 01:25:32.223
She's too good for this.

710
01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:51.776
Did you fuck him?

711
01:25:57.014 --> 01:25:59.284
- Did you?
- Why would I fuck anyone else?


712
01:26:00.218 --> 01:26:01.653
When you are the prophet.

713
01:26:02.253 --> 01:26:03.887
I'll kill you.

714
01:26:11.262 --> 01:26:12.963
Do it.

715
01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:18.403
Leave.

716
01:26:28.546 --> 01:26:30.215
Please don't go.

717
01:26:37.355 --> 01:26:38.989
I'm sorry.

718
01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:45.924
You have to get up now.

719
01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.262
The devil.

720
01:27:53.431 --> 01:27:54.866
I deceive them.

721
01:27:56.501 --> 01:27:58.603
Thrown into the lake of fire.

722
01:28:11.683 --> 01:28:12.983
The Beginning...

723
01:28:14.184 --> 01:28:15.753
and the end.

724
01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:33.471
Lyd... I felt a kick.

725
01:28:41.579 --> 01:28:43.781
Oh, God, I think I'm gonna
have this baby.


726
01:28:43.815 --> 01:28:44.949
Don't.

727
01:28:55.326 --> 01:28:56.861
Sara!

728
01:28:59.998 --> 01:29:01.499
Viv!

729
01:29:05.068 --> 01:29:06.204
What do you see?

730
01:29:07.037 --> 01:29:08.740
Nothing but you.

731
01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:11.476
You got greedy.

732
01:29:12.477 --> 01:29:14.111
You gonna get to heaven
before us.


733
01:29:18.516 --> 01:29:19.851
I don't see heaven.

734
01:29:21.352 --> 01:29:22.487
I don't see hell.

735
01:29:25.188 --> 01:29:26.524
I just see you.

736
01:29:48.078 --> 01:29:49.514
Girls!

737
01:29:58.957 --> 01:30:00.291
Girls!

738
01:30:03.494 --> 01:30:04.762
Girls!

739
01:30:10.034 --> 01:30:13.037
How are we
gonna get off the island?


740
01:30:13.071 --> 01:30:15.940
He was a fisherman
Fishermen have boats.


741
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:21.679
Girls!

742
01:30:21.713 --> 01:30:24.181
I don't think it's here.
I found it over there.


743
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:27.852
Shit! You're right.

744
01:30:38.196 --> 01:30:41.299
Lyd! Lyd! I found it!
I found it!


745
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.219
Girls!

746
01:33:06.744 --> 01:33:11.582
Lyd, Lyd, my water
just broke!


747
01:33:11.616 --> 01:33:14.118
Oh, my God, I think I feel it!

748
01:33:14.152 --> 01:33:18.689
Mom! Mom!
Please, mom!
