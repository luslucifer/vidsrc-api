2
00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:12.123
How did this all happen?

3
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:16.231
I've played this over and
over again in my head.


4
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:19.579
If I'd done something
or said something,


5
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:22.237
none of this would've happened.

6
00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.722
I just wanted to hang out with
the popular girls at school


7
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:28.141
so I became a groupie
and just played along.


8
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.110
How I wish I could
turn the clock back.


9
00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:08.938
Mom?

10
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.250
Mom?

11
00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:11.838
What, Carmen, what?

12
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.426
Have you seen my purse?

13
00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:14.875
I don't know, it's
around somewhere.


14
00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:16.463
Mom, it's Shea's biggest
concert of the year


15
00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.602
and I'm already late.

16
00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:18.810
Life of teenagers.

17
00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.709
Ha! Ha! Hey Carmen,
come and get it.


18
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.537
Hey!

19
00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:22.366
Hey!

20
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.438
Give me that.

21
00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:25.714
Hey, let go.

22
00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:27.405
Let go. Let go.

23
00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.889
Okay, bye mom.

24
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:29.752
Be careful.

25
00:03:29.754 --> 00:03:31.239
I will.

26
00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:37.519
We want
Shea! We want Shea!


27
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:38.865
We want Shea! We want Shea!

28
00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:39.937
We want Shea!

29
00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:43.283
So, Shea, are we going
to the after-party?


30
00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:44.905
That would be so cool.

31
00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:46.010
Are you kidding me?

32
00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.014
This is the after-party.

33
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.016
Yeah.

34
00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:53.328
Shea, what the
hell are you doing?


35
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.294
Hey, Scott!

36
00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:55.261
We gotta get out of here now!

37
00:03:55.263 --> 00:03:56.641
Oh heck no, I'm having fun.

38
00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:58.505
So should you, douche bag.

39
00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:00.956
Shea, not again.

40
00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.164
Oh fuck off, Bill.

41
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.372
Just get the double.

42
00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:06.099
No, it's too
late for that now.


43
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.035
Would you guys get
out of here now?


44
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:11.727
Now!

45
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:15.488
Hey, don't be that way.

46
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.180
Be nice to my groupie friends.

47
00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:19.319
I've got a problem here.

48
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:20.976
I need makeup, 
I need coffee,

49
00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:21.979
I need it...

50
00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:25.155
black and strong.

51
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:32.955
Hey, leave me alone. I
just wanna go to sleep.


52
00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:45.242
Hey, easy man.

53
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.657
You wanna choke me?

54
00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.210
I think I'm good now.

55
00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:49.213
Not quite.

56
00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:55.113
Makeup. I need...

57
00:04:55.115 --> 00:04:56.460
Would you sit up?

58
00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.806
Hey, don't tell me what to do.

59
00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:58.979
Well then sit up!

60
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:01.294
I need a miracle right now.

61
00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.607
What a waste of my time.

62
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:08.957
I don't need this
shit all over my face.


63
00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:13.994
Hey, Wendy, you should
be paying to touch me.


64
00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.272
Is he ready yet?

65
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.894
I was born ready.

66
00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.248
I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.837
Are you gonna be
okay on your own, dear?


68
00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.769
You'll be all right.

69
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.977
Don't worry mom, I'll be fine.

70
00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.254
Just have fun in Africa.

71
00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:33.600
Yeah, the African Safari,

72
00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:35.257
the sounds of the African Drums.

73
00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.122
I think I'll bring
my own drum too.


74
00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:38.950
Honey.

75
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.885
Honey, they have plenty
of drums in Africa.


76
00:05:42.887 --> 00:05:44.232
Oh, all right.

77
00:05:44.234 --> 00:05:45.888
Hey, did you pack my underwear?

78
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.027
Of course I did.

79
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.408
Do I have my passport?

80
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.892
Yes, you do now.

81
00:05:51.171 --> 00:05:52.619
Oh, my poor baby.

82
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:55.001
Bad idea, mom, I don't
want you to catch anything.


83
00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:57.900
Maybe call Dr. Richards,
maybe he can come over.


84
00:05:57.902 --> 00:05:58.832
I will.

85
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:00.386
And you can call us anytime.

86
00:06:00.388 --> 00:06:01.456
No, no phone calls.

87
00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.251
Just enjoy your vacation.

88
00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:05.253
Don't worry, I'll be okay, mom.

89
00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.184
We love you, Jamie.

90
00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:07.567
I love you too.

91
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.465
Bye, mom.

92
00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:11.776
Bye, Jamie.

93
00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:12.915
Bye, soldier.

94
00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:13.849
Bye, dad.

95
00:06:22.272 --> 00:06:24.341
Let's get this party started.

96
00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:03.138
Oh, I see you buddy.

97
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.588
Do your thing, do your thing.

98
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.797
Don't leave me hanging.

99
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.608
Woo!

100
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.574
Hey, Jenn,

101
00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:27.024
take a hit of this.

102
00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:28.027
No thanks.

103
00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:31.235
You don't fool me.

104
00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:32.167
I know what you're trying to do.

105
00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:33.410
What do you mean?

106
00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:35.204
Small town girl who
moves to a new school,


107
00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:37.379
wants to hang out with
all the cool girls.


108
00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:38.242
I feel you.

109
00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:39.174
Stop.

110
00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:40.451
What's this fans of Shea shit.

111
00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:42.350
I know you don't give a
flying fuck about him.


112
00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:43.799
You don't know me, Rocky.

113
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.354
All right then, prove it.

114
00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:48.079
Prove it, prove it, prove it.

115
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.149
Rocky, leave her alone.

116
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.706
You are stoned out of her mind.

117
00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:54.223
What do we have here?

118
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.226
It's good.

119
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.676
See that's why she's my girl.

120
00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.127
Is everybody
having a good time?


121
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:04.958
Wasted!

122
00:08:06.893 --> 00:08:08.893
Wasted! Wasted!

123
00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:10.138
Wasted! Wasted!

124
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.416
Wasted! Wasted!

125
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:14.798
Wasted! Wasted!

126
00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.248
Wasted! Wasted!

127
00:08:18.388 --> 00:08:19.630
Wasted! Wasted!

128
00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:22.012
Wasted! Wasted!

129
00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:24.324
Wasted! Wasted!

130
00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:48.107
What the?

131
00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.973
Did I die and go to hell?

132
00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:55.114
Hey, Jenn, wake up.

133
00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:57.288
Jenn, wake up.

134
00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:02.466
Oh my God, look at this mess.

135
00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:04.744
Ow.

136
00:09:06.194 --> 00:09:07.022
Damn it.

137
00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:10.645
Ladies, wake up.

138
00:09:10.647 --> 00:09:12.370
We've gotta clean this mess.

139
00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:13.201
Go away.

140
00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:20.070
Rocky?

141
00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:21.761
Oh my God.

142
00:09:23.107 --> 00:09:23.936
Rocky?

143
00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:26.108
Hey, Rocky!

144
00:09:34.084 --> 00:09:35.463
Where is everyone?

145
00:09:35.465 --> 00:09:37.637
Dude, it's like the
morning after the party.


146
00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:42.230
Where's my shirt?

147
00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:44.922
Who's Brandi?

148
00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:49.477
Man, Dawn's gonna be pissed.

149
00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:52.652
Where's my wallet and my phone?

150
00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:54.484
Oh fuck, I was robbed.

151
00:09:55.864 --> 00:09:57.864
Oh, here it is,
here's your phone.


152
00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:59.141
You should call someone.

153
00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:01.454
Call your mom or someone.

154
00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:02.457
All right.

155
00:10:09.188 --> 00:10:10.465
Hey, yeah, mom.

156
00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.157
It happened again.

157
00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:16.952
Okay.

158
00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:18.816
Can you come pick me up?

159
00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:19.647
All right.

160
00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:26.444
Fuck off.

161
00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:28.103
They stole my pants.

162
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:39.252
Oh, Rocky.

163
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:43.427
We've gotta clean up this mess.

164
00:10:45.017 --> 00:10:45.845
Jamie?

165
00:10:51.126 --> 00:10:51.955
Jamie?

166
00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:05.691
Jamie, what're you doing?

167
00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:07.347
Put that thing away!

168
00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:08.417
Okay, it's fine.

169
00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:10.109
I'm just messing around.

170
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:11.386
It's fine.

171
00:11:11.388 --> 00:11:12.974
Don't you ever do
that to me again.


172
00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:14.631
You scared me.

173
00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.391
It was just a joke.

174
00:11:16.393 --> 00:11:18.289
Where's you even get that?

175
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:19.189
My dad's.

176
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:25.747
Carmen,

177
00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:30.060
do you ever feel that
your life is meaningless?


178
00:11:30.062 --> 00:11:33.442
That you're only existing
and not really living.


179
00:11:33.444 --> 00:11:36.480
Don't be silly, Jamie, you
have such a wonderful life.


180
00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:39.587
You're the most
popular girl at school.


181
00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:41.934
If I were to drop dead today,

182
00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:42.764
right now,

183
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.352
the world would still carry on.

184
00:11:46.354 --> 00:11:47.871
Nobody cares.

185
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.700
Nobody gives a shit.

186
00:11:49.702 --> 00:11:52.047
Jamie, that's not true.

187
00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:55.777
I wanna do something
exciting with my life.


188
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.610
Something that would
actually mean something.


189
00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.752
Let's get breakfast,
I'm starving.


190
00:12:08.514 --> 00:12:10.997
Shea could be here
with us, right now.


191
00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:12.240
Oh my
God, I would die.


192
00:12:12.242 --> 00:12:13.517
Right?

193
00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.623
Like, how crazy?

194
00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:18.729
Honestly, that's
such a dumb idea.


195
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:20.802
How would that even work?

196
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.633
It is impossible.

197
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:27.255
But I love it, it's awesome.

198
00:12:27.257 --> 00:12:28.739
I knew you would go for it.

199
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:30.051
Don't be stupid.

200
00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:31.569
Hey, it's not stupid.

201
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:34.745
I have Shea's schedule
for the next three weeks.


202
00:12:34.747 --> 00:12:36.954
Sick, I'm loving this already.

203
00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.576
My parents are
gone for two weeks,


204
00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:40.648
so it's literally
perfect timing.


205
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.028
What's the point of this?

206
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.581
We'll bring him to the cabin

207
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:44.686
and convince him to make us
part of his music entourage.


208
00:12:44.688 --> 00:12:46.067
That's so cool.

209
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:47.551
Be his backup dancers.

210
00:12:47.553 --> 00:12:50.278
Concerts all over the world.

211
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.106
Oh,

212
00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:52.729
what about Rocky?

213
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:53.971
Rocky?

214
00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:54.974
Rocky who?

215
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.492
Seriously?

216
00:12:57.494 --> 00:12:58.976
Kidnapping?

217
00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.115
It's not that big of a deal.

218
00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:01.461
It's just for a day or two.

219
00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:02.946
It's still too dangerous.

220
00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.776
I'm sure we will be fine.

221
00:13:05.778 --> 00:13:08.192
Jamie, how long were
you planning this?


222
00:13:08.194 --> 00:13:11.575
Long enough to know
we can pull it off.


223
00:13:13.683 --> 00:13:15.303
Jenn, are you with us or not?

224
00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:16.545
This is insane.

225
00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:19.171
I said, are you
with us or not?


226
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.552
Jenn.

227
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.903
Sure, I'm in.

228
00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:29.731
Yay!

229
00:13:30.872 --> 00:13:32.354
We can't tell anyone.

230
00:13:32.356 --> 00:13:35.599
Seriously, no one can know
about this, all right?


231
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:36.913
To Fans of Shea?

232
00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.777
Fans of Shea!

233
00:13:46.474 --> 00:13:50.165
Here with me tonight is the
music sensation, Shea Bowman.


234
00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:51.235
Thank you, Kay.

235
00:13:51.237 --> 00:13:52.098
So, Shea,

236
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.030
how does it feel

237
00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.618
to have the world at your feet?

238
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.001
To have thousands of fans
screaming and passing out?


239
00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.762
Looks like the fans cannot
get enough of Shea Bowman.


240
00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:02.868
Kay, I love and
respect my fans


241
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.318
because my fans are smart
and intelligent enough


242
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.526
to recognize true talent.

243
00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:07.769
Amazing.

244
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:09.771
So tell us, what do you
have next for your fans?


245
00:14:09.773 --> 00:14:11.255
As I was saying,

246
00:14:11.257 --> 00:14:13.154
there are so many copycats
and wannabes out there


247
00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:16.191
but there's only one, and
I repeat, one Shea Bowman.


248
00:14:16.193 --> 00:14:17.675
Mark my...

249
00:14:17.677 --> 00:14:19.988
Shea, it must feel great
to have such a huge fan base.


250
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.990
Kay, you just cut me off.

251
00:14:21.992 --> 00:14:24.165
Can you let me finish?

252
00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:26.408
As I was saying, there are
so fakes in this industry


253
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.480
trying to be me, trying
to copy my style.


254
00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:31.551
Shea, tell us about
your motivating factor.


255
00:14:31.553 --> 00:14:33.415
What is it that motivates you?

256
00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:35.245
I'm sure your fans
would love to know.


257
00:14:35.247 --> 00:14:38.179
What is it that keeps you
spinning hit after hit?


258
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:40.146
Kay, you keep cutting me off.

259
00:14:40.148 --> 00:14:42.770
Look, I'm done with
this interview, okay?


260
00:14:42.772 --> 00:14:43.598
I'm out of here.

261
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.461
Fuck this!

262
00:14:47.224 --> 00:14:48.776
It's getting pretty late.

263
00:14:48.778 --> 00:14:50.778
I think we should do it two
days from now, on March 15th.


264
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.296
Great, the Ides of March.

265
00:14:52.298 --> 00:14:54.126
Shea's scheduled for
a barber's appointment


266
00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:55.610
at Barry's in Ridge park.

267
00:14:55.612 --> 00:14:56.956
They usually drop him off and
pick him up an hour later.


268
00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:57.888
How about his body guards?

269
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.338
I checked.

270
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.580
When he goes through
Ridge Park, he goes alone.


271
00:15:00.582 --> 00:15:01.996
Homeboy feels
safe in his hood.


272
00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:04.550
So this is how
it's gonna roll.


273
00:15:04.552 --> 00:15:06.034
I was able to login to the
company's dispatch system


274
00:15:06.036 --> 00:15:08.519
and his usual preference
is a black SUV.


275
00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:09.797
So once we log into the system,

276
00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:11.453
we'll just switch it
to a two hour pickup.


277
00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:12.385
Nice.

278
00:15:12.387 --> 00:15:13.628
When he's done at Barry's,

279
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.802
we'll pick him up in
out own black SUV.


280
00:15:14.804 --> 00:15:16.251
But how're you gonna get that?

281
00:15:16.253 --> 00:15:18.115
Don't worry about it.

282
00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:20.083
I still think this
isn't a good idea.


283
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.429
Anything could go wrong.

284
00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:23.362
What could possibly go wrong?

285
00:15:23.364 --> 00:15:25.536
Yeah, Jamie nailed
it down pretty much.


286
00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:28.539
Yeah, it's gonna be
so easy, I promise.


287
00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:49.767
Shea, what is wrong with you?

288
00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:51.286
What the hell was that?

289
00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:53.219
Why are you making such
a big deal out of nothing?


290
00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:55.290
No, this is a big deal.

291
00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:56.636
It's gonna hurt your career.

292
00:15:56.638 --> 00:15:57.775
I was trying to make a point.

293
00:15:57.777 --> 00:15:59.156
She kept cutting me off.

294
00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.951
I picked you out
of the streets, Shea.


295
00:16:00.953 --> 00:16:02.263
Don't you forget that.

296
00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:03.367
Mr. Superstar.

297
00:16:03.369 --> 00:16:04.472
Oh stop it, Scott.

298
00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:05.956
That's so cliche.

299
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.510
Why are you hellbent
on destroying yourself?


300
00:16:08.512 --> 00:16:10.409
We're just trying to help you.

301
00:16:10.411 --> 00:16:12.963
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:14.206
The Fans are going crazy

303
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:16.967
and Shea's ratings have
gone through the roof.


304
00:16:16.969 --> 00:16:19.073
What is it about Shea Bowman?

305
00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:20.835
Now listen to that.

306
00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:23.629
Do you think he's gonna
be around for a long time


307
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:25.424
or do think he'll
be gone in a flash?


308
00:16:25.426 --> 00:16:26.977
I mean, he's been around
for a long time already.


309
00:16:26.979 --> 00:16:28.703
I'm sure he'll be around
for a little while longer.


310
00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:30.705
What's your favorite
thing about him?


311
00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:33.121
His hair? His music? His voice?

312
00:16:33.123 --> 00:16:34.260
His voice.

313
00:16:34.262 --> 00:16:35.675
His voice, yeah?

314
00:16:35.677 --> 00:16:36.607
Do you think he's cute?

315
00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:37.781
On a scale of one to ten,

316
00:16:37.783 --> 00:16:39.748
how cute do you think Shea is?

317
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.680
Ten!

318
00:16:40.682 --> 00:16:42.337
Aw, that's so sweet of you.

319
00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.581
Would you think you're
his number one fan?


320
00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:45.789
Yes.

321
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:47.446
He's a commodity,
let's just say.


322
00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:48.999
Commodity? Thank
you very much.


323
00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:51.726
Wow, let's celebrate
and pop some champagne!


324
00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:53.486
Just looking out for you, kid.

325
00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:55.109
Look, I don't need
anyone looking out for me.


326
00:16:55.111 --> 00:16:56.457
I'm a grown man.

327
00:16:57.872 --> 00:17:00.735
Scott, don't act like we're
family because we're not, okay?


328
00:17:00.737 --> 00:17:02.910
Don't have none,
don't need none.


329
00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:03.807
No, no, Shea.

330
00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:04.637
Please!

331
00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:24.795
It's all there.

332
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.866
Here's your key.

333
00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:30.006
Thanks.

334
00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.317
Ditch them when you're done.

335
00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:33.181
Yeah, of course.

336
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:38.048
Shea, wait, wait.

337
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.568
I'm sorry I came
down so hard on you.


338
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.294
Why don't we have lunch today?

339
00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:43.812
Just the two of us.

340
00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:46.263
Scott, I know all you
care about is the greens.


341
00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.955
I care about you, Shea.

342
00:17:47.957 --> 00:17:49.853
Believe me, I care.

343
00:17:49.855 --> 00:17:51.751
Come on, man, I
was just kidding.


344
00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:53.098
You and I have come a long way.

345
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.962
Indeed we have.

346
00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:56.480
Look, I can't do lunch today.

347
00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:59.380
I have to run to Barry's but
dinner's fine, so book it.


348
00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:02.348
Why do you keep going to
the barber shop in Ridge Park?


349
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.350
You shouldn't even
bee seen there.


350
00:18:04.352 --> 00:18:06.697
It's hard to leave
some things behind.


351
00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:07.905
Cut the nostalgia.

352
00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:09.666
They can't do a
thing for you, Shea.


353
00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:11.840
All they can do
is take from you.


354
00:18:11.842 --> 00:18:14.222
Scott, you
wouldn't understand.


355
00:18:16.916 --> 00:18:18.502
Hey, Scott.

356
00:18:18.504 --> 00:18:22.575
I don't mean half the
things I say to you, okay?


357
00:18:22.577 --> 00:18:24.439
It's all good, Shea.

358
00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:25.615
It's all good.

359
00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:38.076
You okay?

360
00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:41.215
I'm not really hungry.

361
00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:43.633
You've gotta eat something.

362
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.393
I'm gonna be late anyways.

363
00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:49.499
Bye Dillon, be a good boy, okay?

364
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.466
Listen to everything mom says.

365
00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:54.021
Carmen, you're crying.

366
00:18:54.023 --> 00:18:54.987
No,

367
00:18:54.989 --> 00:18:57.543
I just have something in my eye.

368
00:18:58.993 --> 00:19:01.545
I'm gonna be working on a
project with Jamie tonight.


369
00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:03.478
So I'll be there.

370
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.445
Okay.

371
00:19:04.447 --> 00:19:05.411
See you later.

372
00:19:05.413 --> 00:19:06.378
Bye Carmen.

373
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.450
Bye Dillon.

374
00:19:14.698 --> 00:19:16.250
I just sent you a text
with the login instructions


375
00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:17.699
for Executive Limousine,

376
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:21.462
so exactly 2:15, login
switch pickup time to 4:15.


377
00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:22.706
Okay, got it.

378
00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:24.844
Whoa.

379
00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:29.608
I don't have to use it, do I?

380
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.505
No, it's not even loaded.

381
00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:32.440
It's just to scare him.

382
00:19:33.855 --> 00:19:35.131
So when he gets in the car
you're just gonna point at him


383
00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.271
and tell him to be quiet.

384
00:19:37.273 --> 00:19:38.099
Are you good with that?

385
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:39.549
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:40.379
Okay.

387
00:19:48.939 --> 00:19:50.009
Don't move!

388
00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:55.084
Showtime, ladies.

389
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.647
See you in an hour
and don't be late.


390
00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:14.066
Shea!

391
00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:16.033
It's good to see you.

392
00:20:16.035 --> 00:20:17.138
How are you my man, Barry?

393
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.105
How're you doing?

394
00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:20.279
You've been on the news a lot.

395
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.110
Yeah.

396
00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:23.972
So listen,

397
00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:25.077
we want a quick trim?

398
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.665
Yeah, just a little bit off.

399
00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:27.873
Ha! Yeah right.

400
00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:29.046
Just a little.

401
00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:30.807
I'm gonna make this quick.

402
00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:32.119
Dino wants to talk to you.

403
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:34.673
He says it's really important.

404
00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:35.674
Let him wait.

405
00:20:35.676 --> 00:20:37.124
What does he want?

406
00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:38.815
You'll find out.

407
00:20:42.648 --> 00:20:43.992
I can't log in.

408
00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:44.995
Try again.

409
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:51.138
We have to call Jamie.

410
00:20:53.314 --> 00:20:54.348
Hello?

411
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.281
Hey, Jamie, we have to abort.

412
00:20:56.283 --> 00:20:57.385
Login failed.

413
00:20:57.387 --> 00:20:58.869
What? Try again.

414
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:00.250
Repeat, we have to abort.

415
00:21:00.252 --> 00:21:01.286
Login failed.

416
00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:02.597
Carmen, calm down.

417
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:04.774
Just try it one more time.

418
00:21:07.156 --> 00:21:08.431
It's not working, Jamie.

419
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.676
We have to abort right now.

420
00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:12.918
Just give me it.

421
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.404
Jamie, let me try.

422
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.373
It's not working even for her.

423
00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:20.753
Okay, they
must've changed it.


424
00:21:20.755 --> 00:21:22.030
I just need a couple of hours

425
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:23.342
to log back into their system.

426
00:21:23.344 --> 00:21:25.241
We don't have a
couple of hours.


427
00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:29.279
Hold on a second,
the Caps Lock is on.


428
00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:30.798
Jamie, we're in.

429
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.903
Great, let's
proceed as planned.


430
00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:34.836
All right, bye.

431
00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:42.775
Is that good?

432
00:21:42.777 --> 00:21:45.709
Awesome, thank you so much.

433
00:21:45.711 --> 00:21:46.540
Hey.

434
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.437
You're a good kid.

435
00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:50.852
Thanks.

436
00:21:50.854 --> 00:21:52.233
Hey.

437
00:21:52.235 --> 00:21:53.476
Good luck.

438
00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:54.684
See you around soon, okay?

439
00:21:54.686 --> 00:21:56.064
Yeah.

440
00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.171
See you, kid.

441
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:13.254
Superstar is here.

442
00:22:13.256 --> 00:22:15.224
You wanted to see me?

443
00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:17.226
You're late.

444
00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:20.468
I hear the press has
been rough on you.


445
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.369
It's all good. It worked
out well in the end.


446
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:26.578
Now let's talk business.

447
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.821
You have a Canadian
tour in a week, huh?


448
00:22:28.823 --> 00:22:30.444
What's that got
to do with you?


449
00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:32.377
They love you
over there, I heard.


450
00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:33.552
Fans go crazy.

451
00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:37.211
Bring in the candy.

452
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:50.912
Don't even think
about it, Dino.


453
00:22:50.914 --> 00:22:53.398
Really, across the
Canadian border?


454
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.123
It's like a fucking
drive through.


455
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.504
You'll be all right.

456
00:22:56.506 --> 00:22:59.921
Just stop, I don't
care! I'm not doing it!


457
00:22:59.923 --> 00:23:01.511
Dino, no, no and no!

458
00:23:03.168 --> 00:23:04.857
After this run, kid,

459
00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:06.997
you can vacation in Africa

460
00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:09.483
and finish your
orphanage project.


461
00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:11.139
How do you know about that?

462
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:14.142
Dino knows everything.

463
00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:17.078
In fact, I know
this loudmouth punk


464
00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:20.287
kid shit you got going on

465
00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:22.289
is just a show for your fans.

466
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:23.635
Do me this favor

467
00:23:23.637 --> 00:23:25.568
and I'll never bother you again.

468
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.466
I'm sorry, Dino, I can't.

469
00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:29.468
After all I've done for you,

470
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.540
this is how you pay me back?

471
00:23:35.683 --> 00:23:36.512
Yeah.

472
00:23:37.754 --> 00:23:39.582
I know you took me
in when momma overdosed


473
00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:43.793
but I'm done with that life
now and I'm never going back.


474
00:23:43.795 --> 00:23:44.623
Ah, yes.

475
00:23:45.452 --> 00:23:46.934
Marie.

476
00:23:46.936 --> 00:23:48.487
Lovely woman.

477
00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:50.040
It's a shame.

478
00:23:50.042 --> 00:23:52.353
She would have been better
off if she had overdosed.


479
00:23:52.355 --> 00:23:54.010
What're you saying?

480
00:23:54.012 --> 00:23:54.976
Your
momma is still alive


481
00:23:54.978 --> 00:23:56.599
but her brain is fried as hell.

482
00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.085
Tell me the truth,
is Momma still alive?


483
00:24:00.087 --> 00:24:01.017
Goggles,

484
00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:02.225
I know you wouldn't lie to me.

485
00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:04.986
Tell me the truth,
is Momma still alive?


486
00:24:04.988 --> 00:24:08.369
Dino figured you didn't
need anymore problems.


487
00:24:08.371 --> 00:24:10.095
Yeah, she's alive.

488
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.872
You owe me, kid.

489
00:24:28.874 --> 00:24:31.047
I've always had your back

490
00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:33.256
and you need to appreciate it.

491
00:24:33.258 --> 00:24:34.671
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:35.707
No,

493
00:24:35.709 --> 00:24:37.435
I wanted to tell you.

494
00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:40.817
But you became a superstar.

495
00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:46.373
Then I thought, I
couldn't do that to you.


496
00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:48.616
I have to help her,
I have to see her.


497
00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:51.136
That's where you're going.

498
00:24:51.138 --> 00:24:51.966
To Canada.

499
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:59.386
You just need to deliver
a little package for me.


500
00:24:59.388 --> 00:25:00.835
Why Canada?

501
00:25:00.837 --> 00:25:04.252
I thought to keep her
away from the paparazzi.


502
00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:07.083
Also, those folks in Canada,

503
00:25:07.085 --> 00:25:09.844
they mind their
own damn business.


504
00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:12.813
That'll be a
sweet reunion, kid.


505
00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:14.575
When can I see her?

506
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.614
You made the
right decision, kid.


507
00:25:31.765 --> 00:25:33.765
Ouch, easy, you're
gonna break my back.


508
00:25:33.767 --> 00:25:37.596
You're a strong lad,
you'll be all right.


509
00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:39.356
When you cross into Canada,

510
00:25:39.358 --> 00:25:41.600
my contact will pick
up the goods from you


511
00:25:41.602 --> 00:25:43.982
and tell you where she is.

512
00:25:43.984 --> 00:25:46.605
This is probably the last
time I'm gonna see you guys.


513
00:25:46.607 --> 00:25:47.779
Shea,

514
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:49.366
I finally got chartered.

515
00:25:49.368 --> 00:25:51.817
10 long years it took me,
so I'm retiring after this.


516
00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:54.063
Congratulations, Goggles.

517
00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:00.895
Hey, stay still.

518
00:26:00.897 --> 00:26:02.518
Jamie, I'm really
freaking out right now.


519
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.279
Okay, calm down,
it's gonna be fine.


520
00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:06.522
Okay.

521
00:26:15.256 --> 00:26:17.015
I have to carry
my own damn shit


522
00:26:17.017 --> 00:26:18.465
and open my own damn door?

523
00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:19.431
Fuck.

524
00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:20.259
Crappy service.

525
00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:21.191
Shut up.

526
00:26:21.193 --> 00:26:22.192
Don't move.

527
00:26:22.194 --> 00:26:23.470
Who the fuck are you?

528
00:26:23.472 --> 00:26:24.542
Don't move.

529
00:26:57.264 --> 00:26:58.643
What happened?

530
00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.783
Oh my God, it's Shea!

531
00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:03.440
I'm freaking out right now.

532
00:27:03.442 --> 00:27:05.132
You guys, this is
not the time for this.


533
00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:07.341
Let's get this dude inside now.

534
00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:08.445
Is he okay?

535
00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:09.377
Is he dead?

536
00:27:09.379 --> 00:27:10.586
No, he's fine.

537
00:27:10.588 --> 00:27:11.518
I just had to whack
him a little bit.


538
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.208
He was getting out of control.

539
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.522
Aw, poor baby.

540
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.695
You'll be all right.

541
00:27:16.697 --> 00:27:18.801
He's bleeding, maybe we
should take him to a hospital.


542
00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.527
No, we can't, he'll be fine.

543
00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:22.805
Let's just get him inside.

544
00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.496
Carmen, get a hold of yourself!

545
00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:26.498
Get the guitar.

546
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.578
Why is it so heavy?

547
00:27:44.656 --> 00:27:47.554
So he wasn't at
the barber shop?


548
00:27:47.556 --> 00:27:50.869
No, I didn't know the
times had changed.


549
00:27:51.698 --> 00:27:53.042
Okay, thanks.

550
00:27:53.044 --> 00:27:53.872
Bye.

551
00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:56.977
That was the limo driver.

552
00:27:56.979 --> 00:27:59.151
Got to the barber shop
and Shea wasn't there.


553
00:27:59.153 --> 00:28:00.051
That's odd.

554
00:28:01.397 --> 00:28:03.017
He's fine, he's
not a kid anymore.


555
00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.467
No,

556
00:28:04.469 --> 00:28:05.744
we were planning to have
dinner at the Riviera tonight.


557
00:28:05.746 --> 00:28:08.264
He would've called if
he was gonna be late.


558
00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:10.335
Probably still mad at you.

559
00:28:10.337 --> 00:28:12.889
You know, I can't
figure that kid out.


560
00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.960
One moment, the sweetest
kid in the world.


561
00:28:14.962 --> 00:28:17.376
Next, he's just a fucking diva.

562
00:28:17.378 --> 00:28:19.344
You let him get
away with everything.


563
00:28:19.346 --> 00:28:21.760
Maybe I shoulda
book therapy sessions.


564
00:28:21.762 --> 00:28:24.073
You've been saying
that for ages.


565
00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:25.488
Our concerts and
tours are back-to-back


566
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.972
for the next couple
of years anyway,


567
00:28:26.974 --> 00:28:28.595
so I wouldn't worry about it.

568
00:28:28.597 --> 00:28:30.976
Well, it looks like I'm
gonna have dinner by myself.


569
00:28:30.978 --> 00:28:32.288
Reservations are booked.

570
00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.772
You wanna join me?

571
00:28:33.774 --> 00:28:36.637
You go ahead, Scott, I've
got some things to finish up.


572
00:28:36.639 --> 00:28:37.914
Okay.

573
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:38.708
You'll call me if
you hear from him?


574
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.571
Will do.

575
00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:41.057
Enjoy your dinner.

576
00:28:56.348 --> 00:28:58.314
Who are you?

577
00:28:58.316 --> 00:29:00.178
Where is my guitar?

578
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.524
Where is it?

579
00:29:01.526 --> 00:29:04.113
What is the big deal
about this guitar?


580
00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:07.012
You have no idea what you're
getting yourselves into.


581
00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:09.532
I said where is my guitar?

582
00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.777
Wow, this thing is so heavy.

583
00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:14.744
What's in it, rocks?

584
00:29:14.746 --> 00:29:16.504
If this is about money,

585
00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:18.023
you can call my manager, Scott.

586
00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:19.646
He'll give you
whatever you want.


587
00:29:19.648 --> 00:29:22.200
Oh, we don't wanna hurt you.

588
00:29:22.202 --> 00:29:23.442
We're fans.

589
00:29:23.444 --> 00:29:24.651
We go to all your concerts.

590
00:29:24.653 --> 00:29:26.342
We follow you everywhere.

591
00:29:26.344 --> 00:29:28.137
Yeah, we like to
call ourselves...


592
00:29:28.139 --> 00:29:29.828
Fans of Shea.

593
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.451
Crazy groupies,
that's what I need.


594
00:29:32.453 --> 00:29:34.281
Is this some kind of sick joke?

595
00:29:34.283 --> 00:29:35.662
We wanna tour
the world with you.


596
00:29:35.664 --> 00:29:37.146
We wanna be your
backup singers.


597
00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:39.079
Stop, you think
kidnapping me at gunpoint


598
00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:40.632
was gonna make that happen?

599
00:29:40.634 --> 00:29:42.876
You're all a bunch of psychos.

600
00:29:42.878 --> 00:29:44.153
Can you even sing?

601
00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:45.223
Yes.

602
00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:46.776
We took singing lessons.

603
00:29:46.778 --> 00:29:47.777
Do you wanna hear something?

604
00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:48.813
Yeah, go ahead.

605
00:29:48.815 --> 00:29:51.367
Let me hear "Cinderella."

606
00:29:51.369 --> 00:29:53.576
Okay, let's show
him what we got.


607
00:29:56.098 --> 00:29:59.582
♪ Be my Cinderella

608
00:29:59.584 --> 00:30:03.724
♪ A princess way past midnight

609
00:30:03.726 --> 00:30:06.865
Oh my God, you guys are
awful! You're hurting my ears!


610
00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:07.901
You guys suck!

611
00:30:07.903 --> 00:30:09.696
You wanna be part of my team?

612
00:30:09.698 --> 00:30:11.214
Look, that's a joke.

613
00:30:11.216 --> 00:30:12.975
We can do something
different if you like.


614
00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:15.115
I hate to tell you this, but
there's no sugar-coding here.


615
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:17.634
You can't threaten
you way to stardom.


616
00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:19.119
Why are you so mean to us?

617
00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:20.672
I'm sorry, honeybunch,
but you know me,


618
00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:22.570
I don't believe in bullshit.

619
00:30:22.572 --> 00:30:27.334
You just don't have what
it takes to be a superstar.


620
00:30:27.336 --> 00:30:28.300
Hey, you.

621
00:30:28.302 --> 00:30:29.785
You seem to be the leader.

622
00:30:29.787 --> 00:30:31.648
Stop this right
now and let me go.


623
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.615
Shut up!

624
00:30:32.617 --> 00:30:33.998
And if I don't?

625
00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:37.275
I'm gonna shut you up.

626
00:30:39.072 --> 00:30:42.142
Hey, be careful with that.

627
00:30:42.144 --> 00:30:45.559
And stop pointing
that fake gun at me.


628
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:46.940
You think it's fake?

629
00:30:46.942 --> 00:30:48.424
You don't scare me.

630
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:52.430
You're fucking crazy!

631
00:30:53.362 --> 00:30:54.741
You know it's real.

632
00:30:54.743 --> 00:30:55.983
If you wanna stay alive,

633
00:30:55.985 --> 00:30:59.090
keep your mouth shut
and don't piss me off.


634
00:30:59.092 --> 00:31:01.023
Ladies, let's see what's so
special about this guitar.


635
00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:04.612
Hey, you don't
wanna mess with that!


636
00:31:04.614 --> 00:31:06.340
Jen, get over here.

637
00:31:09.758 --> 00:31:11.067
What's that?

638
00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:11.898
Cocaine.

639
00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:17.591
That shit belongs to
some really bad guys


640
00:31:17.593 --> 00:31:19.075
that could do some damage.

641
00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:20.594
Oh, I'm sure.

642
00:31:20.596 --> 00:31:22.838
Would you have any idea how
long you get for kidnapping?


643
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.909
You get 14 years in prison.

644
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:25.841
14 years?

645
00:31:25.843 --> 00:31:28.050
Yeah, 14 years in prison.

646
00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.292
Jamie, is this true?

647
00:31:29.294 --> 00:31:32.571
Don't listen to
him he's a liar.


648
00:31:32.573 --> 00:31:34.677
You're all going to
jail unless the bad guys


649
00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:35.851
kill you first.

650
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:37.542
I don't wanna do this anymore.

651
00:31:37.544 --> 00:31:38.819
I wanna go home.

652
00:31:38.821 --> 00:31:41.063
Jamie, maybe we
should rethink this.


653
00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.547
Maybe we should just let him go.

654
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:43.824
Finally, a voice of reason.

655
00:31:43.826 --> 00:31:45.000
You shut up!

656
00:31:46.967 --> 00:31:49.968
Ladies, let's go to
the next room and talk.


657
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.972
This changes everything.

658
00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:55.974
Hey, you come back here!

659
00:31:55.976 --> 00:31:58.496
You let me out of here, okay?!

660
00:32:01.637 --> 00:32:03.326
I don't think he likes us.

661
00:32:03.328 --> 00:32:05.572
Called us crazy groupies.

662
00:32:06.987 --> 00:32:08.711
We're screwed.

663
00:32:08.713 --> 00:32:10.747
I say we go to the police
and turn ourselves in.


664
00:32:10.749 --> 00:32:11.679
No.

665
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:12.991
They will put us in jail.

666
00:32:12.993 --> 00:32:14.303
You guys, calm down.

667
00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:15.131
I got this.

668
00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.650
I have an idea.

669
00:32:16.652 --> 00:32:18.031
Say we ask for ransom.

670
00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:18.859
What?

671
00:32:18.861 --> 00:32:20.378
You can't be serious.

672
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.277
Say we ask for 500 thousand
dollars and split it evenly.


673
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.554
That's a lot of money.

674
00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:27.352
Yeah, he's worth
millions to them.


675
00:32:28.733 --> 00:32:30.664
Sure hope you know
what you're doing.


676
00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:32.908
Come on, guys, this is
taking it to a whole new level.


677
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.047
This wasn't part of the plan.

678
00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:35.186
Guys, I got this, okay?

679
00:32:35.188 --> 00:32:37.188
Just go home tonight,
get some rest,


680
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.880
I'll watch him tonight and
we'll meet up tomorrow.


681
00:32:39.882 --> 00:32:40.743
Okay.

682
00:32:40.745 --> 00:32:41.571
Okay?

683
00:32:41.573 --> 00:32:42.400
Yeah.

684
00:32:42.402 --> 00:32:43.230
Goodnight.

685
00:32:47.925 --> 00:32:49.616
Will Shea be okay?

686
00:32:50.651 --> 00:32:51.480
Yes.

687
00:32:53.654 --> 00:32:54.722
Goodnight.

688
00:32:54.724 --> 00:32:55.862
Goodnight.

689
00:32:55.864 --> 00:32:56.759
Okay, bye.

690
00:32:56.761 --> 00:32:58.349
See you tomorrow.

691
00:33:14.641 --> 00:33:16.298
What're you doing?

692
00:33:17.678 --> 00:33:18.852
You're insane.

693
00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:21.027
Stop.

694
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:27.999
Ow!

695
00:33:28.897 --> 00:33:30.689
Son of a bitch.

696
00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:32.208
Hey.

697
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.072
I've seen you somewhere before.

698
00:33:35.869 --> 00:33:38.732
I guess you have all night
to figure that out, don't you?


699
00:33:38.734 --> 00:33:40.909
Don't try anything stupid.

700
00:33:53.887 --> 00:33:55.611
For God sake, who is that?

701
00:33:55.613 --> 00:33:56.508
I gotta get it.

702
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.372
It could be Shea.

703
00:34:04.691 --> 00:34:06.003
Is it authentic?

704
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.350
Yeah, I'm on my way in.

705
00:34:10.352 --> 00:34:11.558
Where you going?

706
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.494
I'll let you know
when I get back.


707
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.050
500 thousand dollars.

708
00:34:21.052 --> 00:34:21.984
Hey Bill.

709
00:34:23.468 --> 00:34:24.847
I'm glad you could make
it here so quick, Scott.


710
00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:26.953
Scott, Joe Schneider,
private investigator.


711
00:34:26.955 --> 00:34:28.161
Nice to meet you, Scott.

712
00:34:28.163 --> 00:34:29.748
Joe was with
LAPD for 15 years,


713
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.474
so he's got some experience
with this kind of stuff.


714
00:34:31.476 --> 00:34:33.269
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of everything.


715
00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.964
Okay, where's the ransom note?

716
00:34:37.931 --> 00:34:38.999
"I've
been instructed to write this


717
00:34:39.001 --> 00:34:40.518
"by my captors.

718
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.657
"They'll let me go if you abide

719
00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.348
"by the following instructions.

720
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.282
"Go to two of my banks and
ask for 500 thousand in cash.


721
00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.422
"Take the money to
Lake Wilcox Park.


722
00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:49.699
"There is a phone booth there.

723
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:51.529
"At exactly 12:30PM
the phone will ring


724
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:54.463
"and you will be given
further instructions."


725
00:34:54.465 --> 00:34:55.567
Yeah.

726
00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:58.467
That's Shea's
handwriting, all right.


727
00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:00.676
We've got the Canadian
tour in two days.


728
00:35:00.678 --> 00:35:02.057
Back-to-back concerts

729
00:35:02.059 --> 00:35:05.370
that have been pre-booked
for over a year.


730
00:35:05.372 --> 00:35:06.578
This is messed up.

731
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.133
I will try my best
to wrap this up for us.


732
00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:10.858
Are you sure we
shouldn't call the police?


733
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.239
Too dangerous.

734
00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:13.516
You read the note,
there's nothing we can do.


735
00:35:13.518 --> 00:35:16.935
How the hell did he
get himself kidnapped?


736
00:35:18.523 --> 00:35:20.385
Thanks but I could use a scotch.

737
00:35:20.387 --> 00:35:22.974
I'm gonna ask a few
routine questions here.


738
00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:24.010
Sure, go ahead.

739
00:35:24.012 --> 00:35:25.977
When was he last seen?

740
00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:28.255
He was heading to his
Barber in Ridge Park.


741
00:35:28.257 --> 00:35:29.739
No one's spoken to hin since.

742
00:35:29.741 --> 00:35:31.362
Know anything about
the barber shop?


743
00:35:31.364 --> 00:35:33.329
Same barber he's
used for years.


744
00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.641
Since he's been a kid.

745
00:35:34.643 --> 00:35:36.850
Old Italian guy,
his name is Barry,


746
00:35:36.852 --> 00:35:39.025
treats him like he's his kid.

747
00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:40.405
Anyone been up there yet?

748
00:35:40.407 --> 00:35:41.889
Yeah, Bill was,
but all he knows


749
00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:44.823
is that he was dropped off
and picked up by a black SUV.


750
00:35:44.825 --> 00:35:47.309
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.


751
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:49.897
Go to the bank,
take the money out


752
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:51.382
and just play along.

753
00:35:51.384 --> 00:35:52.590
Joe, are you sure?

754
00:35:52.592 --> 00:35:55.558
We're gonna be watch
their every move.


755
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.388
We're gonna apprehend
those bastards


756
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.667
just like that.

757
00:36:01.221 --> 00:36:03.359
I knew I could count on you.

758
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:06.086
You can be rest assured,
your money is safe.


759
00:36:06.088 --> 00:36:08.192
I don't care about the money!

760
00:36:08.194 --> 00:36:09.883
I care that the kid is safe!

761
00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:11.091
Don't worry.

762
00:36:11.093 --> 00:36:13.716
We're gonna have
him home quickly.


763
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:17.237
Okay.

764
00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.789
Thanks, Joe.

765
00:36:32.977 --> 00:36:34.218
Hello, Scott.

766
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.736
How do you know my name?

767
00:36:35.738 --> 00:36:37.669
I know who you
are and I'm watching you.


768
00:36:37.671 --> 00:36:39.809
Let's see, you're wearing
an old black suit,


769
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:40.983
tacky brown shoes.

770
00:36:40.985 --> 00:36:42.571
Your point?

771
00:36:42.573 --> 00:36:44.883
Follow the instructions
and it'll be over quickly.


772
00:36:44.885 --> 00:36:46.299
Understood.

773
00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:47.714
There's a cellphone
behind the phone booth.


774
00:36:47.716 --> 00:36:48.544
See it?

775
00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:56.619
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

776
00:36:56.621 --> 00:36:57.724
Good.

777
00:36:57.726 --> 00:36:59.691
Now hang up the pay phone.

778
00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:03.661
Are you with me, Scott?

779
00:37:03.663 --> 00:37:04.972
Why are you doing this?

780
00:37:04.974 --> 00:37:06.560
Don't ask
stupid questions.


781
00:37:06.562 --> 00:37:08.286
Look for the garbage can.

782
00:37:08.288 --> 00:37:09.703
No, to the right!

783
00:37:10.808 --> 00:37:12.982
Do you see a red backpack?

784
00:37:14.674 --> 00:37:15.983
Good job, Scott.

785
00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:17.053
Now transfer the money
into the backpack


786
00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:19.263
and do it quickly!

787
00:37:35.695 --> 00:37:37.143
Okay, I'm done.

788
00:37:37.145 --> 00:37:40.146
Now take the backpack
and walk across the bridge.


789
00:37:44.566 --> 00:37:46.048
When was the last time you
took a walk in the park?


790
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.429
That's none of
your damn business.


791
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.293
For you
executives it's all about


792
00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:51.226
money, money and more money.

793
00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:52.227
Business a usual.

794
00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:53.849
Can you just get to the point?

795
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:56.127
I said, keep walking!

796
00:37:56.129 --> 00:37:58.164
Okay, I'm walking.

797
00:38:00.996 --> 00:38:02.202
I'm walking.

798
00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:04.965
Do you
see the backpacks?


799
00:38:05.897 --> 00:38:07.518
No, I don't see anything.

800
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.247
To the
left, you idiot!


801
00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:14.766
Yeah, I see them.

802
00:38:14.768 --> 00:38:15.974
Drop the cellphone
inside the backpack


803
00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:17.700
and drop off the
backpack with the rest.


804
00:38:17.702 --> 00:38:18.701
Then go home.

805
00:38:18.703 --> 00:38:20.186
What?

806
00:38:20.188 --> 00:38:22.878
You will receive
further instructions.


807
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.810
Where's Shea?

808
00:38:23.812 --> 00:38:25.121
I said go home!

809
00:38:25.123 --> 00:38:26.192
We'll contact you.

810
00:38:26.194 --> 00:38:27.158
I'm watching.

811
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.988
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

812
00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:41.933
Now let's see what happens.

813
00:38:50.839 --> 00:38:51.736
No kidding.

814
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.450
What the fuck?!

815
00:39:17.452 --> 00:39:19.971
Which backpack has the money?!

816
00:39:37.782 --> 00:39:39.748
Hey kid, what's your name?

817
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.990
Justice.

818
00:39:40.992 --> 00:39:43.338
Justice, that's a
nice name, I like it.


819
00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.580
I think you have the
wrong bag, though.


820
00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.478
Thank you.

821
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.067
Oh no, thank you.

822
00:39:58.009 --> 00:39:59.423
All right kids, let's go.

823
00:40:25.036 --> 00:40:27.280
All right kids, time to go.

824
00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:45.710
Teacher, the new bus
driver is really cool.


825
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.808
So what're you
trying to tell me?


826
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.674
A bunch of kids disappeared
with 500 thousand dollars?


827
00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:19.882
I'm sorry, Scott.

828
00:41:19.884 --> 00:41:22.920
This is a highly
sophisticated operation.


829
00:41:22.922 --> 00:41:25.476
We could be talking terrorists.

830
00:41:26.477 --> 00:41:27.752
Now what?

831
00:41:27.754 --> 00:41:30.548
Now we know what
we're up against.


832
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.482
We're going to catch those
motherfuckers, don't you worry.


833
00:41:33.484 --> 00:41:35.001
No.

834
00:41:35.003 --> 00:41:36.243
I'm calling the police.

835
00:41:36.245 --> 00:41:38.073
You know what, this
is way over your head.


836
00:41:38.075 --> 00:41:39.971
I don't think you know what
the hell you are doing.


837
00:41:39.973 --> 00:41:43.043
Scott, let's stop and think
about this for a minute.


838
00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:44.320
So we lost 500 grand?

839
00:41:44.322 --> 00:41:45.701
We make that in
less than a week.


840
00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.393
If the press gets a hold of this

841
00:41:47.395 --> 00:41:48.808
and they find out
about the double,


842
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.396
we are screwed.

843
00:41:50.398 --> 00:41:54.641
There will be lawsuits
and it won't be pretty.


844
00:41:54.643 --> 00:41:57.023
Joe, how many cases
have you solved?


845
00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:59.059
This is actually
my first case.


846
00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:02.649
But you were with
the LAPD for 15 years.


847
00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:04.996
I was a janitor for 15 years.

848
00:42:04.998 --> 00:42:07.136
I worked nights and
I studied case files.


849
00:42:07.138 --> 00:42:10.208
I know how these people operate.

850
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.798
Let me handle this.

851
00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:14.836
This is a joke, right?

852
00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:16.732
I'm sorry, Scott.

853
00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.216
I did not know.

854
00:42:18.218 --> 00:42:19.942
I know, Bill, I'm worried
about the kid's safety.


855
00:42:19.944 --> 00:42:23.221
For once, I'm gonna
do the right thing.


856
00:42:23.223 --> 00:42:24.121
Which is?

857
00:42:26.123 --> 00:42:27.502
There's been a kidnapping.

858
00:42:27.504 --> 00:42:28.366
Oh, God.

859
00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:35.371
Thanks for coming
on short notice.


860
00:42:35.373 --> 00:42:36.580
Hey, no sweat, no sweat.

861
00:42:36.582 --> 00:42:38.029
Glad I could help.

862
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:40.860
Hey, this place is chill.

863
00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:42.965
Respect man, I love it.

864
00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:44.311
Thank you.

865
00:42:44.313 --> 00:42:45.865
This is cool.

866
00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:48.697
Hey, check out my
new move. Ready?


867
00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:51.148
Yeah.

868
00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:53.113
Hey,

869
00:42:53.115 --> 00:42:53.942
check out my new song.

870
00:42:53.944 --> 00:42:55.046
I wrote it myself.

871
00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:55.944
You know what I'm saying?

872
00:42:55.946 --> 00:42:57.221
I don't wait around

873
00:42:57.223 --> 00:42:58.843
for people to write
shit for me like Shea.


874
00:42:58.845 --> 00:43:01.190
You get what I'm saying.

875
00:43:01.192 --> 00:43:02.606
No, just hear it out.

876
00:43:02.608 --> 00:43:06.506
You're not Shea and
you're never gonna be Shea.


877
00:43:06.508 --> 00:43:08.715
Okay, listen, just
stick to the script


878
00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:10.406
and don't screw this up.

879
00:43:10.408 --> 00:43:11.304
I got it.

880
00:43:11.306 --> 00:43:12.478
Okay, I got it.

881
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.340
I got it.

882
00:43:13.342 --> 00:43:15.241
No shaking, no shaking.

883
00:43:32.085 --> 00:43:33.499
I think you should let me go.

884
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:35.121
That would be the
smart thing to do.


885
00:43:35.123 --> 00:43:36.605
I'm sorry, I can't.

886
00:43:36.607 --> 00:43:38.089
You seem like a nice girl.

887
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.435
I'd hate to see you go to jail.

888
00:43:39.437 --> 00:43:42.887
Stop, Shea, I
don't wanna listen.


889
00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:44.958
I can tell you're
different from the rest.


890
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.994
How can you tell?

891
00:43:45.996 --> 00:43:47.100
I can tell.

892
00:43:48.343 --> 00:43:51.033
Let's talk about
you, I'm curious.


893
00:43:51.035 --> 00:43:52.897
Why did you get
involved in drugs?


894
00:43:52.899 --> 00:43:54.278
Well, I never
really knew my dad


895
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.452
and my mom was a dope addict.

896
00:43:56.454 --> 00:43:59.732
So the choice was
pretty well made for me.


897
00:43:59.734 --> 00:44:01.667
Everyone has a choice.

898
00:44:03.047 --> 00:44:04.702
My dad left when
I was only seven


899
00:44:04.704 --> 00:44:06.911
and my mom just gave up on life.

900
00:44:06.913 --> 00:44:10.018
She would just sit at
home all day and smoke.


901
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.779
I'd steal groceries and
bring them home to mom.


902
00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:13.677
Hi, momma.

903
00:44:13.679 --> 00:44:15.023
Here are the groceries.

904
00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:15.955
Thanks, hun.

905
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:17.473
Just put them in on the counter.

906
00:44:17.475 --> 00:44:19.337
Thanks, sugar.

907
00:44:24.724 --> 00:44:26.448
Maria, you need to get
off your fucking lazy ass


908
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.001
and get yourself a decent job!

909
00:44:28.003 --> 00:44:30.038
You need to take
care of that boy!


910
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.073
Boy's fine.

911
00:44:31.075 --> 00:44:32.247
No, he isn't.

912
00:44:32.249 --> 00:44:34.732
He's out there stealing
and selling drugs.


913
00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:36.078
He's gonna get himself killed

914
00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.908
or child services is
gonna come take him.


915
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.668
Is that what you want?

916
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:40.533
No!

917
00:44:41.499 --> 00:44:42.706
You better clean yourself up.

918
00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:44.330
You look like hell.

919
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:47.124
Eva!

920
00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:48.435
Eva!

921
00:44:48.437 --> 00:44:50.610
No one's gonna take my boy!

922
00:44:50.612 --> 00:44:52.508
No one's gonna take my son!

923
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.131
Eva, help Eva.

924
00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:56.031
No one's taking my boy.

925
00:44:57.515 --> 00:45:00.447
All right, listen, I'm gonna
help you get a job, okay?


926
00:45:00.449 --> 00:45:02.797
That's what families are for.

927
00:45:04.074 --> 00:45:05.211
Sherman, what're you doing?

928
00:45:05.213 --> 00:45:06.695
Are you waiting for me?

929
00:45:06.697 --> 00:45:08.697
You should be in bed.

930
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:15.117
I think I got me a new job.

931
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:16.394
I'm so excited.

932
00:45:16.396 --> 00:45:19.190
I'm a bit nervous.
It's my first day.


933
00:45:19.192 --> 00:45:21.158
It's gonna be fine.

934
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.469
You'll be fine

935
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.230
and you look so pretty, momma.

936
00:45:24.232 --> 00:45:25.060
Aw.

937
00:45:25.992 --> 00:45:26.821
Thanks.

938
00:45:28.823 --> 00:45:31.202
That must be your Aunt Eva.

939
00:45:31.204 --> 00:45:32.550
Okay, up to bed?

940
00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:36.380
Don't answer the
door to anybody.


941
00:45:36.382 --> 00:45:37.519
I'll be home in a bit.

942
00:45:37.521 --> 00:45:38.347
Okay?

943
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:39.178
Love you.

944
00:45:51.604 --> 00:45:52.430
So here?

945
00:45:52.432 --> 00:45:53.261
Uh huh.

946
00:45:58.335 --> 00:45:59.265
Here he comes.

947
00:45:59.267 --> 00:46:01.508
My freaky Friday John.

948
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.822
I call him Fred.

949
00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:06.755
All right, well I'm
out of here, girl.


950
00:46:06.757 --> 00:46:07.618
Okay.

951
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.171
Good luck.

952
00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:25.291
Hey, rookie bitch.

953
00:46:25.293 --> 00:46:26.950
You talking to me?

954
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.089
What're you doing
in my territory?


955
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:31.124
You got a problem?

956
00:46:31.126 --> 00:46:32.403
No, fuck you!

957
00:46:33.266 --> 00:46:34.440
Later, girl.

958
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:48.141
Hey, baby.

959
00:46:48.143 --> 00:46:49.558
Want some action?

960
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.562
Okay.

961
00:47:06.955 --> 00:47:08.714
Oh my God.

962
00:47:08.716 --> 00:47:12.579
She started selling herself
to support dope habit.


963
00:47:12.581 --> 00:47:13.719
Help me!

964
00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:14.927
Help me!

965
00:47:14.929 --> 00:47:15.757
Help me!

966
00:47:17.276 --> 00:47:18.551
What do you want?

967
00:47:18.553 --> 00:47:19.483
Max!

968
00:47:19.485 --> 00:47:21.347
Max, please, I need some stuff.

969
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:23.383
Get the
fuck away from here!


970
00:47:23.385 --> 00:47:24.246
No! No!

971
00:47:24.248 --> 00:47:25.385
I'll pay you back.

972
00:47:25.387 --> 00:47:26.490
Doc?

973
00:47:26.492 --> 00:47:27.456
Doc?

974
00:47:27.458 --> 00:47:28.699
Doc?

975
00:47:28.701 --> 00:47:30.114
You again?

976
00:47:30.116 --> 00:47:32.116
Please, I need some.

977
00:47:32.118 --> 00:47:33.359
Listen.

978
00:47:33.361 --> 00:47:34.774
There's no credit
here, you gotta go.


979
00:47:34.776 --> 00:47:35.982
Here, here, here.

980
00:47:35.984 --> 00:47:36.914
No, you're
not getting anything.


981
00:47:36.916 --> 00:47:38.088
You're no getting no more.

982
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:38.882
You owe me too
much money already.


983
00:47:38.884 --> 00:47:39.814
I'll do anything.

984
00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:40.642
Look, you want some of this?

985
00:47:40.644 --> 00:47:41.816
Go get some money.

986
00:47:41.818 --> 00:47:42.644
Come back and you can
have all you want.


987
00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:44.025
I'll pay you back.

988
00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.267
There's no more
credit. Get her out, Max!


989
00:47:45.269 --> 00:47:46.613
Get the fuck out of
here, you crack head.


990
00:47:46.615 --> 00:47:48.063
You wanna buy a dog?

991
00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:49.064
Bugger off.

992
00:47:50.343 --> 00:47:52.102
Get out of here and
don't come back, okay?


993
00:47:52.104 --> 00:47:52.965
Please! Please!

994
00:47:52.967 --> 00:47:53.931
No, get away!

995
00:48:09.846 --> 00:48:11.742
I'm sorry, Sherman.

996
00:48:11.744 --> 00:48:12.780
I'm so sorry.

997
00:48:18.716 --> 00:48:20.993
I love you, momma.

998
00:48:20.995 --> 00:48:22.099
I love you.

999
00:48:30.004 --> 00:48:33.729
Shortly after that she
overdosed and Dino let me in.


1000
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:36.180
I thought she overdosed.

1001
00:48:36.182 --> 00:48:38.355
Three years ago there was
this talent show at Ridge Park


1002
00:48:38.357 --> 00:48:40.219
and Scott was there.

1003
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:41.945
After Scott saw me perform,

1004
00:48:41.947 --> 00:48:45.603
he signed me right
away and we left.


1005
00:48:45.605 --> 00:48:47.813
Why did you go
back to doing drugs?


1006
00:48:47.815 --> 00:48:49.262
I didn't.

1007
00:48:49.264 --> 00:48:52.438
I mostly go to Ridge Park from
time-to-time to see Barry.


1008
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.716
He was like the dad I never had.

1009
00:48:54.718 --> 00:48:58.478
Somehow going back there made
me feel connected to mom.


1010
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.929
When Dino told me she was
still alive, I had no choice.


1011
00:49:00.931 --> 00:49:01.930
She's still alive?

1012
00:49:01.932 --> 00:49:03.587
Yes she is, Carmen.

1013
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:05.416
He told me to move
the drugs to Canada


1014
00:49:05.418 --> 00:49:08.281
and he'll tell me
where to find her.


1015
00:49:08.283 --> 00:49:10.699
Now I'll never see her again.

1016
00:49:15.704 --> 00:49:17.152
I'm so sorry.

1017
00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:19.154
I didn't realize you had
all this shit to deal with.


1018
00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:21.398
Yeah, well we all got shit.

1019
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.228
Yeah.

1020
00:49:25.507 --> 00:49:27.924
I've never told anybody this,

1021
00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:32.512
but I wasn't always
the spoiled rich girl


1022
00:49:32.514 --> 00:49:34.549
who grew up in the suburbs.

1023
00:49:34.551 --> 00:49:37.932
My dad was a high
school teacher.


1024
00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:39.830
He killed himself
when he lost the job


1025
00:49:39.832 --> 00:49:42.248
he had for the past 18 years.

1026
00:49:43.801 --> 00:49:46.285
Before we knew it,
the debts piled up


1027
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:49.117
and he just couldn't
deal anymore.


1028
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.568
He drove his car over a bridge.

1029
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.330
It was ruled an accident

1030
00:49:57.332 --> 00:49:59.677
and my mom got this huge
insurance settlement


1031
00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:03.891
and that's how we were able
to afford to move here.


1032
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.448
He gave up his own life so
we could have a better one.


1033
00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:13.208
I didn't cry at his funeral.

1034
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.727
I hated him.

1035
00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:18.075
He had no right to take his
own life if he truly loved me.


1036
00:50:22.047 --> 00:50:23.807
The problem is, Shea,

1037
00:50:24.808 --> 00:50:26.292
I really miss him.

1038
00:50:27.466 --> 00:50:30.193
I think about him
every single day


1039
00:50:31.746 --> 00:50:34.128
and the fact of the matter is

1040
00:50:35.094 --> 00:50:36.993
he's never coming back.

1041
00:50:51.766 --> 00:50:53.007
I shouldn't have done that.

1042
00:50:53.009 --> 00:50:54.284
I'm sure the DA
can cut you a deal.


1043
00:50:54.286 --> 00:50:55.975
You can still walk
away from this.


1044
00:50:55.977 --> 00:50:57.252
I don't know, Shea.

1045
00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.909
What if this is some
made up sob story


1046
00:50:58.911 --> 00:51:00.669
about Dino and your mom?

1047
00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:02.361
What if it's all just a lie?

1048
00:51:02.363 --> 00:51:05.157
Carmen, you have
to believe me.


1049
00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:07.642
I don't trust you, Shea.

1050
00:51:07.644 --> 00:51:09.989
I wouldn't lie to you.

1051
00:51:12.166 --> 00:51:13.372
I'll be outside.

1052
00:51:13.374 --> 00:51:14.202
Carmen!

1053
00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:21.552
I'm Detective Steve Callahan,
this is my partner, Wayne.


1054
00:51:21.554 --> 00:51:22.760
This is Bill, the
assistant manager,


1055
00:51:22.762 --> 00:51:24.659
and Joe, the
private investigator


1056
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:26.488
whose been working on the case.

1057
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.043
All right, I'm gonna need a
list of all of Shea's friends


1058
00:51:29.045 --> 00:51:30.699
and anyone else
he hangs out with.


1059
00:51:30.701 --> 00:51:31.977
That'll be pretty easy.

1060
00:51:31.979 --> 00:51:34.151
He spends most of
his time with us.


1061
00:51:34.153 --> 00:51:35.394
No girlfriends?

1062
00:51:35.396 --> 00:51:37.844
The odd groupie,
nothing serious.


1063
00:51:37.846 --> 00:51:41.538
Do you know anyone
who may be behind this?


1064
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.988
Not a clue.

1065
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.645
I'm gonna need recent
footage of all of his concerts


1066
00:51:45.647 --> 00:51:46.612
and I'm gonna need
to know more about


1067
00:51:46.614 --> 00:51:48.200
that school bus trip as well.

1068
00:51:48.202 --> 00:51:50.825
Like taking candy from a kid?

1069
00:51:52.137 --> 00:51:53.860
Five hundred grand.

1070
00:51:53.862 --> 00:51:55.552
How the hell did that happen?

1071
00:51:55.554 --> 00:51:58.037
We're close to
solving this case.


1072
00:51:58.039 --> 00:51:59.556
My men are on it.

1073
00:51:59.558 --> 00:52:00.729
Is that right?

1074
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:02.179
Do you have any suspects?

1075
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:04.354
Any persons of interest?

1076
00:52:04.356 --> 00:52:06.045
We're looking at everything.

1077
00:52:06.047 --> 00:52:08.530
Terrorists, alien abductions,

1078
00:52:08.532 --> 00:52:09.773
Voodoo.

1079
00:52:09.775 --> 00:52:11.395
We're gonna get those bastards.

1080
00:52:11.397 --> 00:52:13.949
Those motherfuckers
are going down!


1081
00:52:13.951 --> 00:52:18.025
I just need a couple more
days to wrap things up.


1082
00:52:20.406 --> 00:52:23.511
15 years with the LAPD, huh?

1083
00:52:23.513 --> 00:52:24.514
Oh my God.

1084
00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:27.860
Scott, just sit
tight, we're on it.


1085
00:52:27.862 --> 00:52:29.793
Bye the way, Joe,

1086
00:52:29.795 --> 00:52:33.762
you're officially
retired from this case.


1087
00:52:40.633 --> 00:52:42.288
I'm really sorry
about all of this, Shea.


1088
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.910
You'll be home soon, I promise.

1089
00:52:43.912 --> 00:52:45.222
It's okay.

1090
00:52:45.224 --> 00:52:46.430
Do you want some?

1091
00:52:46.432 --> 00:52:47.261
Sure.

1092
00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:52.436
You're so cool,
I can't believe I'm standing next to you.


1093
00:52:52.438 --> 00:52:53.957
Thank you, Jenn.

1094
00:52:54.889 --> 00:52:56.682
You're very pretty, Jenn.

1095
00:52:56.684 --> 00:52:57.512
Thanks.

1096
00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:59.719
I like your eyes.

1097
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:01.514
They're really
bright and sincere.


1098
00:53:01.516 --> 00:53:03.171
I can see right
through your heart.


1099
00:53:03.173 --> 00:53:04.036
Really?

1100
00:53:05.002 --> 00:53:07.658
Do you have a boyfriend?

1101
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.798
No, we broke up.

1102
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.112
Well some day you're gonna
make some lucky guy very happy.


1103
00:53:13.114 --> 00:53:15.287
I sure hope so.

1104
00:53:15.289 --> 00:53:18.393
Um, Jenn, I need to
go to the bathroom.


1105
00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:19.739
Can you untie these ropes?

1106
00:53:19.741 --> 00:53:21.293
It'll only be a few minutes.

1107
00:53:21.295 --> 00:53:22.363
I should ask Jamie.

1108
00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:23.260
No, wait!

1109
00:53:23.262 --> 00:53:24.882
I want you to take me.

1110
00:53:24.884 --> 00:53:27.299
I'll ask Jamie, it'll
only take a second.


1111
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:28.198
No, wait!

1112
00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.720
There's nothing to eat here.

1113
00:53:34.446 --> 00:53:35.410
Oh, that's cute.

1114
00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.757
Jamie, Shea has to go pee.

1115
00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:38.588
Okay.

1116
00:53:40.969 --> 00:53:43.694
Wait, what about this one?

1117
00:53:43.696 --> 00:53:45.526
I like this color too.

1118
00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:48.045
Go!

1119
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.360
Anyway.

1120
00:53:54.362 --> 00:53:55.844
Sorry about the gun.

1121
00:53:55.846 --> 00:53:58.053
Jamie told me I had to.

1122
00:54:00.679 --> 00:54:02.163
Now the other one.

1123
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.308
Okay, let's go.

1124
00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:13.381
Up the stairs.

1125
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.107
Go.

1126
00:54:21.182 --> 00:54:23.009
Are you gonna come in and
watch me and my business?


1127
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:25.046
I guess I'll wait outside.

1128
00:54:34.747 --> 00:54:35.576
Shea?

1129
00:54:37.785 --> 00:54:40.026
Shea, are you okay?

1130
00:54:41.064 --> 00:54:41.892
Shea?

1131
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:46.759
Oh shit!

1132
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.555
Jamie! Jamie!

1133
00:54:51.557 --> 00:54:52.763
Shea got away!

1134
00:54:52.765 --> 00:54:53.592
What?!

1135
00:54:53.594 --> 00:54:54.420
How?

1136
00:54:54.422 --> 00:54:55.249
Where is he?

1137
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:56.111
He ran out back.

1138
00:54:56.113 --> 00:54:57.147
Jesus fuck!

1139
00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:57.975
Stay here!

1140
00:54:57.977 --> 00:54:58.804
Come on, let's go!

1141
00:54:58.806 --> 00:55:00.426
I'm sorry!

1142
00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.326
He couldn't have gone too far.

1143
00:55:03.328 --> 00:55:04.948
Let's just split up.

1144
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:05.880
Shea!

1145
00:55:05.882 --> 00:55:07.778
Where the fuck are you?

1146
00:55:08.919 --> 00:55:10.195
Split up.

1147
00:55:10.197 --> 00:55:11.575
Shea?!

1148
00:55:11.577 --> 00:55:13.405
Shea, where are you?

1149
00:55:13.407 --> 00:55:15.096
Shea, I don't
have time for this.


1150
00:55:15.098 --> 00:55:16.235
Shea?!

1151
00:55:16.237 --> 00:55:17.100
Shea!

1152
00:55:18.584 --> 00:55:19.413
Shea!

1153
00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:22.137
Shea?!

1154
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.191
Hello, superstar.

1155
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:41.433
I oughta shoot you.

1156
00:55:41.435 --> 00:55:42.263
Move!

1157
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:44.886
Come on you guys.

1158
00:55:57.071 --> 00:55:59.485
Chain him up, ladies.

1159
00:55:59.487 --> 00:56:00.762
Sit down.

1160
00:56:18.886 --> 00:56:20.819
I just need a minute.

1161
00:56:25.824 --> 00:56:27.962
Why don't you guys go home?

1162
00:56:27.964 --> 00:56:30.516
Jenn and I will
watch him tonight.


1163
00:56:30.518 --> 00:56:31.347
Okay.

1164
00:56:32.209 --> 00:56:33.797
Okay, good night.

1165
00:56:40.494 --> 00:56:42.735
Jenn almost got away
because of your stupidity.


1166
00:56:42.737 --> 00:56:44.772
This has nothing
to do with her.


1167
00:56:44.774 --> 00:56:47.568
That's not exactly true.

1168
00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:52.297
Jenn's been a bad girl and
now she's gonna have to pay.


1169
00:56:52.299 --> 00:56:54.644
Leave her alone,
this is all my fault!


1170
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:07.588
I'm really sorry, Jamie.

1171
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.555
Hey, it's okay.

1172
00:57:09.557 --> 00:57:12.662
I bet he used his rockstar
charms on you, huh?


1173
00:57:12.664 --> 00:57:15.527
I guess I just didn't
know what I was thinking.


1174
00:57:15.529 --> 00:57:16.942
Have you told
anyone about Shea?


1175
00:57:16.944 --> 00:57:18.771
No, I would never do that.

1176
00:57:18.773 --> 00:57:19.600
Good.

1177
00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.326
I know I can trust you.

1178
00:57:21.328 --> 00:57:22.188
Why don't I give
you a ride home?


1179
00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.502
No, I think I can manage.

1180
00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:26.434
You sure?

1181
00:57:26.436 --> 00:57:27.504
Yeah.

1182
00:57:27.506 --> 00:57:28.436
All right.

1183
00:57:28.438 --> 00:57:29.955
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

1184
00:57:29.957 --> 00:57:31.405
All right, bye Jamie.

1185
00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:32.269
Bye.

1186
00:58:00.505 --> 00:58:01.331
Steve?

1187
00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:02.539
Yeah?

1188
00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:05.370
Here's the list of the
people front row seats


1189
00:58:05.372 --> 00:58:08.752
at seven out of ten of
Shea's pervious shows.


1190
00:58:08.754 --> 00:58:10.582
Any of them look suspicious?

1191
00:58:10.584 --> 00:58:13.932
No, they look all
pretty normal to me.


1192
00:58:15.243 --> 00:58:16.519
You a big Shea fan?

1193
00:58:16.521 --> 00:58:17.727
No.

1194
00:58:17.729 --> 00:58:19.625
I'm too old for
that kind of music.


1195
00:58:19.627 --> 00:58:22.697
But my niece, she's
crazy about Shea.


1196
00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.561
If she knew what was
going on right now,


1197
00:58:24.563 --> 00:58:26.218
she'd be crying her eyes out.

1198
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.048
I bet.

1199
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.775
So these girls are so into it

1200
00:58:31.777 --> 00:58:33.398
that they get tickets to almost

1201
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.778
every one of this
guy's concerts?


1202
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:35.609
Mhmm.

1203
00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:41.336
How much do those front
row seats cost again?


1204
00:58:41.338 --> 00:58:43.649
I don't know but it's
gotta cost a fortune.


1205
00:58:43.651 --> 00:58:45.202
Must be a bunch of rich kids.

1206
00:58:45.204 --> 00:58:47.101
You got that right.

1207
00:58:47.103 --> 00:58:48.240
Sorry to interrupt.

1208
00:58:48.242 --> 00:58:49.448
Yeah, come on in.

1209
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.139
I pulled a picture
from security cam feed


1210
00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:53.107
of the barber shop.

1211
00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:57.422
Jamie, senior at
Richmond Falls High.


1212
00:58:57.424 --> 00:59:00.045
She was adopted at age nine
by Annie and Ron Feldman.


1213
00:59:00.047 --> 00:59:02.116
She grew up in the same
neighborhood as Shea


1214
00:59:02.118 --> 00:59:05.153
and not too far from
the barber shop.


1215
00:59:05.155 --> 00:59:06.709
Great, thank you.

1216
00:59:10.264 --> 00:59:11.265
Holy shit.

1217
00:59:12.646 --> 00:59:14.231
There's gotta be some
sort of connection there.


1218
00:59:14.233 --> 00:59:15.785
That's what I'm thinking.

1219
00:59:15.787 --> 00:59:17.096
You know what,
just keep digging.


1220
00:59:17.098 --> 00:59:18.339
See what you can find.

1221
00:59:18.341 --> 00:59:20.065
I got it.

1222
00:59:20.067 --> 00:59:21.687
Jamie

1223
00:59:21.689 --> 00:59:22.518
Feldman.

1224
00:59:29.386 --> 00:59:30.731
Hey, man.

1225
00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:31.663
Hey.

1226
00:59:31.665 --> 00:59:33.977
Yeah, Dino sits over there.

1227
00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:39.912
Bling.

1228
00:59:39.914 --> 00:59:42.432
This is all they have.

1229
00:59:42.434 --> 00:59:43.675
Have you looked
through it yet?


1230
00:59:43.677 --> 00:59:45.193
Nope

1231
00:59:45.195 --> 00:59:47.679
According to our guy, the cops
say the girls in this photo


1232
00:59:47.681 --> 00:59:50.785
are in connection
with the kidnapping.


1233
00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.855
Shit.

1234
00:59:51.857 --> 00:59:53.236
It's Stone.

1235
00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.515
Shit.

1236
00:59:56.517 --> 00:59:57.380
Bling.

1237
01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:05.144
Now this makes sense.

1238
01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:06.491
This was from
the school camera


1239
01:00:06.493 --> 01:00:08.113
from the box's exchange.

1240
01:00:08.115 --> 01:00:10.667
Looks like your kidnappers
got away with a cool half mill


1241
01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:12.358
and they still haven't
gotten your boy back.


1242
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.396
This sounds like a job
only Stone could pull off.


1243
01:00:15.398 --> 01:00:17.260
Now this makes a lot of sense.

1244
01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:18.986
She must've known
about the Canadian runs.


1245
01:00:18.988 --> 01:00:22.161
I want you and Goggles to
find Stone and find her quick.


1246
01:00:22.163 --> 01:00:24.405
I want my merchandise back.

1247
01:00:24.407 --> 01:00:26.616
Do whatever you need to do.

1248
01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.897
And I thought I was
gonna retire quietly.


1249
01:00:33.899 --> 01:00:35.245
Just find her!

1250
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:40.768
Come in.

1251
01:00:43.046 --> 01:00:43.873
Steve?

1252
01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:45.150
Yeah?

1253
01:00:45.152 --> 01:00:45.840
A Miss Duncan is
here to see you.


1254
01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:46.878
Send her in.

1255
01:00:48.086 --> 01:00:49.844
Thank you.

1256
01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.053
Hi, I'm Detective
Steve Callahan.


1257
01:00:52.055 --> 01:00:53.261
Donna Duncan.

1258
01:00:53.263 --> 01:00:55.332
My daughter is missing.

1259
01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:56.541
Have a seat.

1260
01:00:58.545 --> 01:00:59.820
How long has your
daughter been missing?


1261
01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:01.373
Almost two days.

1262
01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:02.305
Did she call?

1263
01:01:02.307 --> 01:01:04.859
It's so unusual for her.

1264
01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.482
Who are her closest friends?

1265
01:01:07.484 --> 01:01:08.622
Well, she's been hanging out

1266
01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:10.175
with this girl
from school lately.


1267
01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:14.561
Can you identify any of
these girls in the picture?


1268
01:01:15.423 --> 01:01:17.216
That's Jamie and Dawn

1269
01:01:17.218 --> 01:01:21.013
and the new girl
from the east coast.


1270
01:01:21.015 --> 01:01:21.844
Carmen.

1271
01:01:23.293 --> 01:01:25.226
And that's my daughter.

1272
01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:30.160
Can you tell me anything
about her recent activities


1273
01:01:30.162 --> 01:01:32.646
or any odd behavior?

1274
01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:34.233
Is she in trouble?

1275
01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:35.236
Is she okay?

1276
01:01:36.755 --> 01:01:38.997
We don't know all
the details yet.


1277
01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:41.413
But I promise I'll do
my best to find her.


1278
01:01:41.415 --> 01:01:45.488
So please, call me if you
hear anything from her.


1279
01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:48.765
You have to find
her, detective.


1280
01:01:48.767 --> 01:01:50.698
She's my little girl.

1281
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.908
I promise I'll do
my best, Mrs. Duncan.


1282
01:01:55.463 --> 01:01:56.462
I'll find her.

1283
01:01:56.464 --> 01:01:58.016
Okay?

1284
01:01:58.018 --> 01:01:59.431
Thank you for coming in.

1285
01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:01.297
Thank you, detective.

1286
01:02:07.717 --> 01:02:10.235
Wow, this guy is so annoying.

1287
01:02:10.237 --> 01:02:11.512
What do you want?

1288
01:02:11.514 --> 01:02:12.893
We have to get out
of here right now.


1289
01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.135
Why?

1290
01:02:14.137 --> 01:02:15.136
Jamie's dangerous,
she's gonna kill us.


1291
01:02:15.138 --> 01:02:16.310
She killed Jenn!

1292
01:02:16.312 --> 01:02:17.518
Now I know you're
acting crazy.


1293
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.623
Why would she kill Jenn?

1294
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.625
I swear I heard the gunshots.

1295
01:02:20.627 --> 01:02:21.764
No.

1296
01:02:21.766 --> 01:02:23.179
Jenn ran away.

1297
01:02:23.181 --> 01:02:25.250
Listen, I care about you.

1298
01:02:25.252 --> 01:02:28.115
This may be the only chance
we have to get out alive.


1299
01:02:28.117 --> 01:02:30.358
Can I really trust you, Shea?

1300
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.464
I have feelings for you.

1301
01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:34.399
I know you feel it too.

1302
01:02:35.434 --> 01:02:37.607
I can see it in your eyes.

1303
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:39.611
That night in the woods.

1304
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:42.200
Why?

1305
01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:44.856
I don't know.

1306
01:02:44.858 --> 01:02:46.202
Yes you do.

1307
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.972
This is crazy.

1308
01:02:57.629 --> 01:02:58.697
Hey Carmen.

1309
01:02:58.699 --> 01:02:59.562
We got it.

1310
01:03:01.288 --> 01:03:03.357
Hey, Rocky and I
can take it from here.


1311
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:05.290
So I guess we'll take
care of Shea tonight


1312
01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:06.601
and Jamie said we could.

1313
01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:09.018
So you can go home
with your family.


1314
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.019
Oh, okay.

1315
01:03:10.021 --> 01:03:11.091
Later, Rocky.

1316
01:03:12.437 --> 01:03:14.437
Chains and gags, Carmen?

1317
01:03:15.509 --> 01:03:16.888
She's crazy.

1318
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:18.061
I got groupies too.

1319
01:03:18.063 --> 01:03:19.168
Okay, stop.

1320
01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.138
Dawn, come here.

1321
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.415
Dawn, we have to
get out of here.


1322
01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:29.072
Jamie is dangerous,
she's gonna kill us.


1323
01:03:29.074 --> 01:03:31.661
If we do not get out of here
right now, we're gonna die!


1324
01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:33.456
- Shut up!
- We're going to die!


1325
01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:35.734
Dawn, look what I found.

1326
01:03:35.736 --> 01:03:36.597
What now?

1327
01:03:36.599 --> 01:03:37.529
A guitar.

1328
01:03:37.531 --> 01:03:38.564
I'm gonna sing him my song.

1329
01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:39.807
Please, help me.

1330
01:03:39.809 --> 01:03:40.946
He's gonna sign me
to his record label.


1331
01:03:40.948 --> 01:03:42.672
Hey, buddy.

1332
01:03:42.674 --> 01:03:44.053
Whoa.

1333
01:03:44.055 --> 01:03:45.744
What conditioner
do you use, man?


1334
01:03:45.746 --> 01:03:47.332
Some of that lady stuff?

1335
01:03:47.334 --> 01:03:48.333
All right.

1336
01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:50.266
I'm gonna take a
selfie with you.


1337
01:03:50.268 --> 01:03:52.233
All the chicks are
gonna be digging it.


1338
01:03:52.235 --> 01:03:53.062
All right.

1339
01:03:53.064 --> 01:03:54.477
One, two, three.

1340
01:03:54.479 --> 01:03:55.685
Groupies!

1341
01:03:55.687 --> 01:03:57.963
Rocky, please carry
this, it's heavy.


1342
01:03:57.965 --> 01:03:59.724
Grab the money, let's go.

1343
01:03:59.726 --> 01:04:01.829
What about your groupie pals?

1344
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:03.313
Hurry up.

1345
01:04:03.315 --> 01:04:04.729
Don't worry about them.

1346
01:04:04.731 --> 01:04:05.868
Let's go.

1347
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:07.283
Rock on, buddy.

1348
01:04:07.285 --> 01:04:09.803
Can't wait till your
next album comes out.


1349
01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:11.528
All right, we're
gonna go to Delaware,


1350
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:13.945
but first I need to buy
some weed, all right.


1351
01:04:15.638 --> 01:04:16.982
You guys going somewhere?

1352
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.364
Oops.

1353
01:04:19.366 --> 01:04:20.917
Drop something?

1354
01:04:39.766 --> 01:04:40.732
Oh, Shea.

1355
01:04:42.389 --> 01:04:44.182
Jamie, just give me
my cut and I'll leave.


1356
01:04:47.497 --> 01:04:48.462
You got the gun.

1357
01:04:48.464 --> 01:04:49.566
Just take it all.

1358
01:04:49.568 --> 01:04:50.880
Really?

1359
01:04:51.778 --> 01:04:53.018
Who the hell is this guy?

1360
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.157
Shut up, Rocky.

1361
01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:55.607
How do I put this?

1362
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:57.229
I'm her partner in crime.

1363
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:59.438
Amongst other things.

1364
01:05:05.136 --> 01:05:06.411
She did.

1365
01:05:08.587 --> 01:05:10.311
So, Dawn,

1366
01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:12.624
you broke the code
of secrecy, huh?


1367
01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:14.039
Look, Jamie, I
just told Rocky.


1368
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:14.971
He won't tell anyone.

1369
01:05:14.973 --> 01:05:16.939
You broke the code, Dawn.

1370
01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:18.526
Jamie, don't do
anything stupid.


1371
01:05:18.528 --> 01:05:19.804
Yeah, you got the money.

1372
01:05:19.806 --> 01:05:20.770
Come on.

1373
01:05:20.772 --> 01:05:22.185
Let's just go for a walk.

1374
01:05:22.187 --> 01:05:22.737
You're not
gonna get away from this.


1375
01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:23.669
Move!

1376
01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:25.188
We're all fans of Shea.

1377
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:29.194
We're friends, you know.
We smoke weed together.


1378
01:05:52.839 --> 01:05:53.701
Oh no!

1379
01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:19.486
God!

1380
01:06:22.834 --> 01:06:23.764
Shea!

1381
01:06:23.766 --> 01:06:25.248
We have to get out of here!

1382
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.456
Jamie's going crazy.

1383
01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.595
She's killing everybody!

1384
01:06:27.597 --> 01:06:30.081
We have to leave now!

1385
01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:31.015
Let's go.

1386
01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.225
Hello, Shea.

1387
01:06:36.227 --> 01:06:37.226
Dino?

1388
01:06:37.228 --> 01:06:38.744
Where's my merchandise?

1389
01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:41.230
Jamie's got it but we have
to get out of here right now.


1390
01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:42.610
How the fuck did
you get entangled


1391
01:06:42.612 --> 01:06:44.026
with a bunch of crazy groupies

1392
01:06:44.028 --> 01:06:45.579
putting my business at risk?

1393
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:46.960
We can talk about
all of this later,


1394
01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:49.272
but right now we really
have to get out of here!


1395
01:06:49.274 --> 01:06:50.480
Listen,

1396
01:06:50.482 --> 01:06:52.586
Jamie, as you call
her, or Stone,


1397
01:06:52.588 --> 01:06:55.554
is a cold-hearted assassin.

1398
01:06:55.556 --> 01:06:56.866
You should know her.

1399
01:06:56.868 --> 01:06:59.938
Stone's from Ridge
Park, just like you.


1400
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.353
Stone?

1401
01:07:01.355 --> 01:07:02.320
Can't be.

1402
01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:03.873
It is.

1403
01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:06.186
That overweight little kid was
adopted by some wealthy folks


1404
01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:09.085
right after her
parents were murdered.


1405
01:07:09.087 --> 01:07:12.709
She shows up one day
and asks me for work.


1406
01:07:12.711 --> 01:07:14.711
I think we should get out
of here before she gets back.


1407
01:07:14.713 --> 01:07:17.024
Stone took out my boy, Bling.

1408
01:07:17.026 --> 01:07:18.612
He was my trusted friend,

1409
01:07:18.614 --> 01:07:21.339
my bodyguard and friend
for more than 20 years.


1410
01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:22.583
She has to pay!

1411
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.757
Listen,

1412
01:07:25.759 --> 01:07:27.172
I'm sorry

1413
01:07:27.174 --> 01:07:29.554
but this has gone way
to messy and bloody.


1414
01:07:29.556 --> 01:07:30.486
What're you doing?

1415
01:07:30.488 --> 01:07:31.866
Come on, Dino, don't do this.

1416
01:07:31.868 --> 01:07:33.420
Stone would've
killed you both.


1417
01:07:33.422 --> 01:07:35.180
So it makes no difference.

1418
01:07:37.598 --> 01:07:38.977
Sorry, Shea.

1419
01:07:38.979 --> 01:07:40.841
But like they say
in the business,


1420
01:07:40.843 --> 01:07:43.809
it's just a bunch of loose
ends that need to be brunt off.


1421
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:51.198
Stone.

1422
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:54.337
Damn you, crazy bitch!

1423
01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.585
I should've done
this a long time ago.


1424
01:08:00.587 --> 01:08:02.863
Recruiting kids into
your dope squad?


1425
01:08:02.865 --> 01:08:05.972
Most of them dead
before they hit 16.


1426
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.007
Any last words?

1427
01:08:10.597 --> 01:08:11.423
Stone.

1428
01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:16.499
Did you kill your parents?

1429
01:08:19.813 --> 01:08:21.295
What do you think?

1430
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.927
Am I missing something here?

1431
01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:33.376
Enjoy the romance while it lasts

1432
01:08:33.378 --> 01:08:36.276
but I have a plane to catch.

1433
01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.244
I'm sure you know who
I am by now, Shea.


1434
01:08:39.246 --> 01:08:40.728
Stone?

1435
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:42.318
You look different.

1436
01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.078
So you do remember me.

1437
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.011
I'm so sorry, Jamie.

1438
01:08:47.013 --> 01:08:48.255
You knew her?

1439
01:08:50.085 --> 01:08:51.705
Yeah, Shea.

1440
01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:52.535
Go ahead.

1441
01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:55.605
Show her your ugly side.

1442
01:08:55.607 --> 01:08:58.850
Show you how you turned my
childhood into a nightmare.


1443
01:08:58.852 --> 01:09:02.338
How I wanted to kill
myself because of you.


1444
01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:13.554
Hey guys.

1445
01:09:13.556 --> 01:09:14.831
Yeah?

1446
01:09:14.833 --> 01:09:15.625
Wanna go pick on
fatso over there?


1447
01:09:15.627 --> 01:09:16.971
Yeah, let's go.

1448
01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.390
How's it going, fatso?

1449
01:09:21.392 --> 01:09:23.185
Hey there, weirdo.

1450
01:09:23.187 --> 01:09:25.980
Hey there, stone
face, stone, stone.


1451
01:09:28.571 --> 01:09:31.055
You gave me that
name, "Stone."


1452
01:09:31.057 --> 01:09:33.057
We were just kids having fun.

1453
01:09:33.059 --> 01:09:35.473
Bullying is fun,
isn't it, Sherman?


1454
01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:38.890
Isn't that exciting to see
the look on those kids faces?


1455
01:09:38.892 --> 01:09:41.444
That kid's messed up for life.

1456
01:09:41.446 --> 01:09:42.652
Okay, guys.

1457
01:09:42.654 --> 01:09:46.000
We go in, we grab
the stuff and we run.


1458
01:09:46.002 --> 01:09:47.899
Is that Stone behind us?

1459
01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:49.866
She's kinda spooking me out.

1460
01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:53.077
Yeah, I think she
likes you, Shea.


1461
01:09:53.079 --> 01:09:56.666
Shea, tell your girlfriend
to stop stalking us.


1462
01:09:56.668 --> 01:09:59.326
Okay, she's not my girlfriend.

1463
01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:02.603
Leave us alone, Stone!

1464
01:10:02.605 --> 01:10:05.951
And stop following
us, you freak.


1465
01:10:05.953 --> 01:10:09.093
Stop, what's
that in your hand?


1466
01:10:11.718 --> 01:10:12.924
They're getting married.

1467
01:10:12.926 --> 01:10:13.994
I know, right.

1468
01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:16.548
I don't even like her!

1469
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.687
Let's go.

1470
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:19.137
She's so weird.

1471
01:10:27.113 --> 01:10:28.181
I'm so sorry.

1472
01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:29.906
I'm so sorry, I was stupid.

1473
01:10:29.908 --> 01:10:32.875
It's too late to be sorry.

1474
01:10:32.877 --> 01:10:36.120
Jamie, did you really
kill your parents?


1475
01:11:07.498 --> 01:11:09.256
Always creeping up on people.

1476
01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:11.155
Fuck, beat it, fatty!

1477
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:40.080
Amber, is that you?

1478
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:41.909
What the fuck?

1479
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.874
Mrs Watkins, help, help!

1480
01:12:15.393 --> 01:12:16.875
My parents have been shot!

1481
01:12:16.877 --> 01:12:18.014
Oh my God.

1482
01:12:18.016 --> 01:12:20.051
I saw him shoot them.

1483
01:12:20.053 --> 01:12:21.225
I'll call 911.

1484
01:12:21.227 --> 01:12:22.158
Come on in!

1485
01:12:23.332 --> 01:12:25.436
Damn dope dealers.

1486
01:12:25.438 --> 01:12:28.128
They didn't give
a shit about me.


1487
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:30.684
I put them out of their misery.

1488
01:12:31.892 --> 01:12:34.238
Then I was adopted
by the Feldman's.


1489
01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.067
Started a new life
in the suburbs


1490
01:12:36.069 --> 01:12:39.104
hanging out with
all the rich kids.


1491
01:12:39.106 --> 01:12:41.624
That got boring real fast.

1492
01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:44.800
So I went back to Ridge Park
and started working for Dino.


1493
01:12:44.802 --> 01:12:46.905
I worked with him
until last month.


1494
01:12:46.907 --> 01:12:48.081
You used us.

1495
01:12:49.013 --> 01:12:51.669
That was the easy part.

1496
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:53.705
You're all so dumb and naive.

1497
01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:56.846
A bunch of spoiled rich kids.

1498
01:12:56.848 --> 01:12:59.470
Jamie, you need
help, let me help you.


1499
01:12:59.472 --> 01:13:02.438
Just put the gun down, okay?

1500
01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.855
This is for all those
times in Ridge Park.


1501
01:13:05.857 --> 01:13:08.444
I wanna hear you say it again.

1502
01:13:08.446 --> 01:13:09.652
Come on, say it.

1503
01:13:09.654 --> 01:13:10.483
Fatso.

1504
01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:13.000
Ugly Duckling?

1505
01:13:13.002 --> 01:13:14.416
Stone Face?

1506
01:13:14.418 --> 01:13:15.796
Weirdo, loser? 
Fucking say it!

1507
01:13:15.798 --> 01:13:17.764
I'm sorry, Jamie!
I said I'm sorry!


1508
01:13:17.766 --> 01:13:19.768
I was young and foolish!

1509
01:13:20.872 --> 01:13:22.389
Look, Jamie.

1510
01:13:22.391 --> 01:13:23.528
Just put the gun down.

1511
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.081
I know you don't wanna do this.

1512
01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:27.291
Shea, don't come any
closer or I'll kill you.


1513
01:13:27.293 --> 01:13:28.499
I know you're hurting.

1514
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:30.535
Okay but that's in the past now.

1515
01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:33.193
You can still make this right.

1516
01:13:33.195 --> 01:13:36.092
Shea, I'm sorry but
I can't go to jail.


1517
01:13:36.094 --> 01:13:40.340
They have doctors that
will make you well again.


1518
01:13:41.928 --> 01:13:42.756
Jamie.

1519
01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.689
Jamie, look at me.

1520
01:13:46.691 --> 01:13:47.759
Jamie.

1521
01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:53.077
Okay?

1522
01:13:55.182 --> 01:13:57.528
Well, well, well.

1523
01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:01.463
Darling, wasn't that a
trip down memory lane.


1524
01:14:01.465 --> 01:14:03.465
Bill, you're involved in this?

1525
01:14:03.467 --> 01:14:05.089
Hello, superstar.

1526
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.297
You know, that was really good.

1527
01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:10.299
You almost had her.

1528
01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:12.301
No hard feelings, Shea.

1529
01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:14.165
Bill, wait.

1530
01:14:14.167 --> 01:14:15.580
Let's just talk about this.

1531
01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.271
What is there to talk about?

1532
01:14:17.273 --> 01:14:19.273
I can't fucking think
straight right now!


1533
01:14:19.275 --> 01:14:20.516
You can't fucking
think straight


1534
01:14:20.518 --> 01:14:22.691
because he's messing
with your mind!


1535
01:14:25.005 --> 01:14:27.454
Don't move or I'm gonna
shoot your girlfriend.


1536
01:14:29.216 --> 01:14:30.181
You think I care?

1537
01:14:30.183 --> 01:14:32.183
Go ahead, shoot her.

1538
01:14:32.185 --> 01:14:33.046
Why, Bill?

1539
01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:34.668
Because I am sick

1540
01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:38.983
of listening to your
wining and your bullshit!


1541
01:14:38.985 --> 01:14:40.674
Babysitting your grown ass

1542
01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:44.126
while Scott lets
you disrespect me?


1543
01:14:44.128 --> 01:14:45.921
And poor Scott.

1544
01:14:45.923 --> 01:14:48.613
Poor Scott, he's never
gonna know anything.


1545
01:14:48.615 --> 01:14:50.512
Bill, you can't be
serious right now.


1546
01:14:50.514 --> 01:14:52.376
Now put the gun down

1547
01:14:52.378 --> 01:14:55.102
or go ahead and just
shoot her already.


1548
01:14:55.104 --> 01:14:56.656
You know he's
not gonna kill me.


1549
01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.140
Just let them go.

1550
01:15:00.213 --> 01:15:01.007
Get out!

1551
01:15:02.526 --> 01:15:03.389
Just go!

1552
01:15:05.183 --> 01:15:07.114
Come on, Bill.

1553
01:15:07.116 --> 01:15:08.564
Let's just go.

1554
01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:11.084
We have new identities,
we have the money,


1555
01:15:11.086 --> 01:15:12.016
let's just go!

1556
01:15:12.018 --> 01:15:13.224
Now you're having regrets?

1557
01:15:13.226 --> 01:15:15.606
This is not you, Stone.

1558
01:15:15.608 --> 01:15:18.022
No killings, Bill.

1559
01:15:18.024 --> 01:15:19.092
Shea, go!

1560
01:15:19.094 --> 01:15:20.956
Stay right there!

1561
01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:22.992
Don't you know the rules?

1562
01:15:33.246 --> 01:15:34.489
I'm so sorry.

1563
01:15:36.352 --> 01:15:38.838
I just couldn't do it anymore.

1564
01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:45.810
Just go.

1565
01:15:46.777 --> 01:15:48.123
Get out of here.

1566
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:52.953
This time for real, Carmen.

1567
01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:53.782
Jamie, no!

1568
01:16:33.479 --> 01:16:37.722
I'm sorry, Jamie, for
all the pain I caused you.


1569
01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:39.724
Goodbye, Jamie.

1570
01:16:39.726 --> 01:16:42.246
It didn't have to be this way.

1571
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.671
Hey.

1572
01:16:55.673 --> 01:16:57.466
You kids okay?

1573
01:16:57.468 --> 01:16:59.021
Yeah, we're okay.

1574
01:17:30.328 --> 01:17:31.157
Mom?

1575
01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:33.608
Sherman?

1576
01:17:34.712 --> 01:17:36.472
Sherman, is that you?

1577
01:17:38.647 --> 01:17:39.510
Oh.

1578
01:17:41.754 --> 01:17:42.858
I failed you.

1579
01:17:44.688 --> 01:17:46.860
I failed you, my boy.

1580
01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.000
No you didn't.

1581
01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:51.002
My poor sweet boy.

1582
01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:52.486
I'm now a rockstar, mom,

1583
01:17:52.488 --> 01:17:54.385
and I've come to
take care of you.


1584
01:17:54.387 --> 01:17:55.317
No.

1585
01:17:55.319 --> 01:17:56.976
Shea, I am so sorry.

1586
01:17:58.529 --> 01:17:59.942
I've let you down.

1587
01:17:59.944 --> 01:18:00.876
It's okay.

1588
01:18:03.154 --> 01:18:04.224
Who's this?

1589
01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.191
This is Carmen.

1590
01:18:07.193 --> 01:18:09.952
She's a very special friend.

1591
01:18:09.954 --> 01:18:11.264
Hi, Maria.

1592
01:18:11.266 --> 01:18:13.507
We've come to take you home.

1593
01:18:21.345 --> 01:18:22.896
I will
always miss my friends,


1594
01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.624
Dawn, Jenn and Jamie.

1595
01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:28.281
A part of me died that night.

1596
01:18:28.283 --> 01:18:29.109
I lost them

1597
01:18:29.111 --> 01:18:30.561
but I found love.

1598
01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:36.254
I guess being the wife of
a rockstar is not too bad.


1599
01:18:36.256 --> 01:18:38.015
I still go to Shea's concerts,

1600
01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:40.845
so I guess I'm still a groupie.

1601
01:18:40.847 --> 01:18:42.021
Well, sort of.

1602
01:18:44.195 --> 01:18:46.023
How are you doing
today, Mrs. Bowman?


1603
01:18:46.025 --> 01:18:47.300
I'm doing well, James.

1604
01:18:47.302 --> 01:18:48.163
Thanks.

1605
01:19:01.767 --> 01:19:06.767
