2
00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:43.039
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:45.975
Papa, we've made you breakfast.

4
00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:48.110
Only Francoise is too
little to carry the tray,


5
00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:49.512
so we have Philippe to help.

6
00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:51.714
Yes, Uncle. I am the strongest.

7
00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.282
I could carry it.

8
00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.217
My queen. Good morning, Majesty.

9
00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.389
Be it known
that we intend to hold court


10
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.858
at the Palace of Versailles

11
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.860
within the coming month of May.

12
00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:08.397
Clap.

13
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.200
Do you see how important it is to
elicit the appropriate response?


14
00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:12.568
Yes.

15
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.904
To this auspicious end,

16
00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.239
the finest examples of humanity

17
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.676
shall embody
the true glory of France


18
00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:25.081
in a palace of eternal
and resounding splendor.


19
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.882
Take note.

20
00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:28.551
Your eloquence they must love,

21
00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:30.519
your demeanor they must fear.

22
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:32.822
I have further commanded

23
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:37.159
that the greatest masters of
France will realize this vision


24
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:40.763
unparalleled in
the history of the world


25
00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.933
in gardens of exquisite

26
00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.669
and matchless beauty.

27
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.941
Heaven

28
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.944
shall be here.

29
00:03:58.141 --> 00:03:59.741
The light is fading, master.

30
00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:05.481
Torches!

31
00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:04.440
<i>Madame?</i>

32
00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:28.430
Is it?

33
00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.133
A week tomorrow at 11:00.

34
00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.603
Don't forget about the length.

35
00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.206
If you stand on the hem,
you'll rip it at the waist.


36
00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:38.774
It's pinching me here.

37
00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:37.299
Thank you.

38
00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.185
<i>Master Le Notre,</i>

39
00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:59.922
<i>I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.</i>


40
00:06:59.924 --> 00:07:02.024
<i>I've long been
an admirer of your work.</i>


41
00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.026
<i>Le Notre?</i>

42
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:06.362
Too clever by half,
if you ask me.


43
00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.530
And riding on his father's name.

44
00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:12.968
The strategy I employ
is to imitate.


45
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.037
They cannot resist flattery.

46
00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.359
'Tis all vanity
to these bigwigs.


47
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:21.276
Of course, once you're in,
you must have the talent.


48
00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:23.679
Speaking of vanity,

49
00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:27.087
there's a hat, now, gentlemen.

50
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.553
Who is this person?

51
00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:32.688
That's <i>Madame</i> de Barra.

52
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:36.558
I'm astounded by that.

53
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:04.319
<i>Monsieur</i> Mauve's plans.

54
00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:09.892
How many more candidates,
Claude?


55
00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:12.934
Three more, <i>monsieur,</i> after this
one, but the end is in sight.


56
00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:18.534
Dullness or disrespect,
that is my apparent choice.


57
00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:20.202
If the king's demands
were not so vast,


58
00:08:20.204 --> 00:08:21.904
I would build
the gardens myself.


59
00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:23.205
Indeed, master.

60
00:08:23.207 --> 00:08:24.840
And in the meantime...

61
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:33.115
<i>Monsieur</i> Mauve.

62
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.117
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

63
00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:37.352
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

64
00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:40.789
That a new coat?
The wife's idea.


65
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.291
Be covered in mud by Tuesday,

66
00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:43.892
but by then she thinks
we'll have this job,


67
00:08:43.894 --> 00:08:45.861
so the coat will have been
a worthwhile extravagance.


68
00:08:45.863 --> 00:08:47.063
Sound reasoning.

69
00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:49.765
Gentlemen,
I've not had the pleasure.


70
00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:52.734
Jean Risse and Daniel Le Vielle,

71
00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:53.969
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra.

72
00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:56.071
You're all here
for the interview?


73
00:08:56.073 --> 00:08:57.372
We are, and you?

74
00:08:57.374 --> 00:08:58.874
The same.

75
00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:00.275
Been in Paris long, <i>madame?</i>

76
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.877
Two years.

77
00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:04.213
And you've worked
for someone before that?


78
00:09:04.215 --> 00:09:07.149
I know all the contractors
in the provinces.


79
00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.451
All the gentlemen, that is.

80
00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:11.086
There is no gentleman, <i>monsieur.</i>

81
00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:12.328
I work for myself.

82
00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:17.059
We all to be interviewed
at this time?


83
00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:18.227
We're here early

84
00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:20.329
to spy out the other candidates.

85
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:22.598
I've been in already.
Oh, how did you fare?


86
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.133
Spent upwards
of an hour with him.


87
00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:27.336
Very detailed examination of the
work, so, you know, we shall see.


88
00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:28.804
You must have impressed him.

89
00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:30.139
I worked for his father.

90
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:32.341
I'm not disheartened.

91
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.284
He seems not disheartened, too.

92
00:09:42.286 --> 00:09:43.719
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

93
00:09:45.622 --> 00:09:47.256
Well, gentlemen.

94
00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:48.258
Best of fates to you.

95
00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:51.260
Claude Moulin, <i>madame.</i>

96
00:09:51.262 --> 00:09:53.428
Secretary to Master Le Notre.

97
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.997
Have you met the master before?

98
00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:56.098
I have not.

99
00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:23.992
<i>Madame.</i>

100
00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:24.994
Sir.

101
00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:29.063
I'm delighted to
make your acquaintance.


102
00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:32.534
I have long been
an admirer of your work.


103
00:10:32.536 --> 00:10:34.336
I am so pleased to attend...

104
00:10:34.338 --> 00:10:36.171
These are your plans, <i>madame?</i>

105
00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:38.907
Yes. Some are to be
seen around the country.


106
00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:40.676
Others are still in progress,

107
00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:43.345
not yet completed.

108
00:10:43.347 --> 00:10:48.016
However, as required, there are two
sets of plans to your instructions.


109
00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:50.018
The fifth and sixth, I believe.

110
00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:53.488
Perhaps at the bottom...

111
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.890
I have examined them.

112
00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.260
Ah. So...

113
00:10:58.262 --> 00:10:59.728
May I ask you a question,
<i>madame?</i>


114
00:11:01.164 --> 00:11:02.264
By all means, master.

115
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:03.799
Are you a believer in order?

116
00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:07.603
Order? Order over landscape?

117
00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:10.539
Well, I admire it.

118
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:12.941
Looking at these plans,
there seems to be no trace.


119
00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:16.318
I would not agree.

120
00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:19.114
I think there is pattern enough

121
00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:21.116
in number six
to suggest absolutely...


122
00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:24.419
Do you believe
in order over landscape?


123
00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:34.329
Order seems to demand that we look
back to Rome or to the Renaissance.


124
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.867
What I'm saying is, surely,

125
00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:41.937
isn't there something
uniquely French


126
00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:44.139
as yet not celebrated by us?

127
00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:49.077
Which needs the rules
of order to attain it.


128
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.445
All of my work

129
00:11:51.748 --> 00:11:54.916
is based on a principle
you choose to deny.


130
00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:56.752
I wonder that
you tender yourself


131
00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:59.054
for a position with
someone you believe


132
00:12:00.623 --> 00:12:01.823
to be outdated.

133
00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:05.427
Sir, I... I have
nothing but admiration


134
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:06.628
for the scale of your work.

135
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.597
You were the first
to use such techniques.


136
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:12.668
I must apologize for any insult
that I may have unwittingly


137
00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:16.071
offered you.

138
00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:17.806
Perhaps, <i>madame,</i>

139
00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:19.174
when you have been
in the public eye


140
00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:20.309
and available for ridicule

141
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:22.010
for as long as my family has,

142
00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:24.513
you will think again
about this conversation.


143
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.550
Good day to you.

144
00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.686
Three minutes, would you say?

145
00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.539
How was the interview? Well?

146
00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:27.776
Not so well.

147
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.542
You have a preferred
candidate, master?


148
00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:38.647
The king wants to
improve on perfection


149
00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:39.849
and reach for the impossible.

150
00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:44.085
I'm surrounded by barbarians.

151
00:14:44.087 --> 00:14:46.655
No doubt it's death
if I fail him.


152
00:14:46.657 --> 00:14:48.223
Prison, more like.

153
00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:50.959
Get your hands dirty,
see what grows.


154
00:14:50.961 --> 00:14:52.961
That's what your father
would have done.


155
00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:00.001
You once said,
"No man, however grand,"


156
00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:02.304
"knows what he wants
until you give it to him."


157
00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:04.172
True.

158
00:16:13.643 --> 00:16:15.083
<i>A gentleman wishes to see you.</i>

159
00:16:15.511 --> 00:16:17.345
<i>Monsieur</i> Le Notre.

160
00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:19.147
Here? Don't worry, I'll stay.

161
00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:21.483
Come on.

162
00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:22.485
Oh! Here.

163
00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:24.425
Go on.

164
00:16:37.066 --> 00:16:39.426
<i>Madame</i> will be
with you presently.


165
00:18:49.632 --> 00:18:52.133
My father taught me gardening.

166
00:18:52.135 --> 00:18:54.569
He encouraged me to see
beauty and re-create it,


167
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:57.138
not as an exercise,
more as an act of faith.


168
00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:02.677
He told me that God put
us first into a garden,


169
00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:07.082
and when we lost Eden, we were fated
to search and reinvent it again,


170
00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:10.051
but only some of us have
the gift of knowing this.


171
00:19:12.154 --> 00:19:14.956
Only some of us have that gift.

172
00:19:21.664 --> 00:19:23.965
I spied on you today before
you attended the interview.


173
00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.239
You moved one of my pots.

174
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.250
I did.

175
00:19:41.617 --> 00:19:42.851
I was curious.

176
00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:52.527
I will not take up
too much of your time.


177
00:19:53.629 --> 00:19:56.231
I have been looking
again at your plans.


178
00:19:56.233 --> 00:19:58.066
You did not care for them.
I am none the less for it.


179
00:19:58.068 --> 00:19:59.734
In plain truth, 
I am used to it.

180
00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:02.303
I did not say I did not
care for your plans.


181
00:20:02.305 --> 00:20:04.305
I said I could find
no order in them.


182
00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:07.542
This abundance of chaos,

183
00:20:08.544 --> 00:20:09.844
this is your Eden?

184
00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:14.082
My search for it.

185
00:20:14.084 --> 00:20:17.719
I spoke today of the pressure
of being in the public eye.


186
00:20:17.721 --> 00:20:20.889
I will spare you any repetition,
but, <i>madame,</i> in my world,


187
00:20:20.891 --> 00:20:24.225
even anarchy is
by royal command,


188
00:20:24.227 --> 00:20:26.027
and chaos must adhere to budget.

189
00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:29.664
Good evening.

190
00:20:54.824 --> 00:20:56.658
Later, <i>messieurs.</i>

191
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.259
Gentlemen.

192
00:21:07.603 --> 00:21:09.470
Welcome to Versailles.

193
00:21:09.472 --> 00:21:12.106
You found your way here without
too much effort, I hope.


194
00:21:12.108 --> 00:21:14.209
The map you sent
was wonderfully accurate.


195
00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:15.810
I shall need it to
get back out again.


196
00:21:15.812 --> 00:21:17.779
We shall be
traveling about a bit.


197
00:21:17.781 --> 00:21:20.682
<i>Madame</i> de Barra, <i>Monsieur</i> Sualem and De Ville.

198
00:21:20.684 --> 00:21:22.483
They are building
the Marly waterworks


199
00:21:22.485 --> 00:21:24.519
and an aqueduct from
there to Versailles,


200
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:27.789
which we hope will alleviate the
severe water shortage here.


201
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:29.524
<i>Madame.</i> Gentlemen.

202
00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:31.292
<i>Madame</i> de Barra
will be constructing


203
00:21:31.294 --> 00:21:33.628
the Rockwork Grove
here at Versailles.


204
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.330
Water, or rather the lack of it,

205
00:21:35.332 --> 00:21:36.965
will be a pressing concern.

206
00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:38.666
Master, the king's
ambitions are already...


207
00:21:38.668 --> 00:21:41.302
Are vast and ever changing,
and our task is to meet them.


208
00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:44.539
With respect, no man can
meet infinite demand.


209
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:46.074
The king's commands
are not infinite, De Ville.


210
00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:47.842
They are the king's commands.

211
00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:50.078
Well, quite so, but the
aqueduct can only do so much.


212
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.479
When we began construction,

213
00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:52.981
I was under
the impression that...


214
00:21:52.983 --> 00:21:54.916
The past is history.

215
00:21:54.918 --> 00:21:56.918
Our task is to suppress
nature to our will,


216
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.887
according to the present plans.

217
00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:01.256
But, <i>monsieur,</i>
the money being spent.


218
00:22:01.258 --> 00:22:03.024
The aqueduct will
carry sufficient water


219
00:22:03.026 --> 00:22:04.826
to the gardens of
Versailles because it must.


220
00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:06.661
That is your brief.

221
00:22:06.663 --> 00:22:07.929
<i>Madame?</i>

222
00:22:10.032 --> 00:22:12.333
It is essentially your plan,

223
00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:15.670
number six in your
submission, I believe.


224
00:22:15.672 --> 00:22:18.006
This part is entirely
original to myself.


225
00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:21.943
You see?

226
00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:23.945
It fits onto this
end of your plan.


227
00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:27.916
Now you can see the
extent of the enterprise.


228
00:22:28.384 --> 00:22:29.384
Yes.

229
00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:33.288
It's a large, flat area.

230
00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:38.459
An arena with tiered sides.

231
00:22:38.894 --> 00:22:40.194
Indeed.

232
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.334
The orchestra

233
00:22:47.202 --> 00:22:48.636
will be up here.

234
00:22:48.638 --> 00:22:49.871
Orchestra?

235
00:22:51.206 --> 00:22:52.373
A ballroom.

236
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.877
It's an outdoor ballroom.

237
00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:57.445
There is a pool of builders.

238
00:22:57.447 --> 00:22:59.948
Select whatever
supplies you care to.


239
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.350
Commission whatever embellishments
you think appropriate.


240
00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:04.552
Time is not unlimited.

241
00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:08.056
Here's the budget.

242
00:23:08.058 --> 00:23:09.624
Try not to exceed it.

243
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.367
Master?

244
00:23:22.237 --> 00:23:23.471
Why me?

245
00:23:26.442 --> 00:23:28.109
These gardens
should be large enough


246
00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:31.379
to embrace voices
other than my own.


247
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:20.161
<i>Mama!</i>

248
00:24:20.163 --> 00:24:21.396
I'm coming.

249
00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:44.819
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

250
00:24:44.821 --> 00:24:47.655
<i>Monsieur,</i> forgive me
for disturbing you at home,


251
00:24:47.657 --> 00:24:49.777
but I've been
reworking the plans.


252
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.662
If... If we fill

253
00:24:54.664 --> 00:24:56.731
a reservoir
at the top of the hill,


254
00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:58.599
we would have enough water
to run the fountains


255
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:01.702
and the building works.

256
00:25:01.704 --> 00:25:04.672
We don't need water continually
if we just recycle it.


257
00:25:04.674 --> 00:25:07.075
Pressure will force it
back up to the start again.


258
00:25:07.077 --> 00:25:10.111
And there's a river,

259
00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:14.182
here, underground.

260
00:25:15.017 --> 00:25:16.684
May I? Of course.

261
00:25:23.192 --> 00:25:25.893
Well, thank you, <i>madame.</i>

262
00:25:25.895 --> 00:25:27.795
I will examine
these in more detail.


263
00:25:27.797 --> 00:25:30.031
I must apologize
if this adds to the turmoil.


264
00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:31.265
I am trained to it.

265
00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:33.301
Like a good plant, I submit.

266
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.481
We waited
an hour for a gaming table.


267
00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:23.151
Montespan and Lauzun
had monopolized them.


268
00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:26.654
Anyway, then came the news
her house was on fire.


269
00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:28.823
We felt sure this would
end her winning streak.


270
00:26:28.825 --> 00:26:31.359
Apparently not.
The marquise played on.


271
00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.828
Her children were safe,
what could she do?


272
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.898
She showed wonderful spirit
and was clapped for it.


273
00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:41.107
How does this dress
look on me, Andre?


274
00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:43.538
Andre, are you listening?

275
00:26:44.373 --> 00:26:45.573
You look very well in it.

276
00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:49.402
What are you studying
that's so important?


277
00:26:50.179 --> 00:26:51.746
Some plans.

278
00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:54.182
Versailles.

279
00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.359
Are these the drawings that
woman brought to the house?


280
00:27:01.156 --> 00:27:02.757
They are. I see.

281
00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:08.034
Button these
gloves for me, Andre.


282
00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:18.906
Blunt instruments.

283
00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:23.169
Perhaps that's what
makes us a good match.


284
00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:25.012
You're creative,

285
00:27:25.014 --> 00:27:27.682
but unable for the more
delicate maneuvers.


286
00:27:27.684 --> 00:27:29.317
Don't forget that, Andre.

287
00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:31.052
I'm the expert.

288
00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:34.689
You're merely the gardener,
however grand.


289
00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:37.558
Without me to promote
your interests, well,


290
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.795
use your famous imagination.

291
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.260
That's more than
enough for one day.


292
00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:23.224
What...

293
00:28:24.206 --> 00:28:27.275
Where are you...
Where are you going?


294
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.381
Luc?

295
00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.400
<i>The sight of you,</i> madame.

296
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:29.136
What time were you up
this morning?


297
00:29:29.138 --> 00:29:30.871
Did you not sleep again?

298
00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:32.440
I don't remember.

299
00:29:32.442 --> 00:29:34.308
You must take more care.

300
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.010
You'll never last at this rate.

301
00:29:36.012 --> 00:29:37.812
Then what will become of us?

302
00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:40.681
I always think of something.
Hmm.


303
00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:42.116
Came today.

304
00:29:47.856 --> 00:29:49.223
What does it say?

305
00:29:54.663 --> 00:29:55.763
What does it say?

306
00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:12.880
Anyone you know?

307
00:30:19.054 --> 00:30:20.321
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

308
00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:29.196
Need to know your way
around the crews.


309
00:30:29.198 --> 00:30:31.399
Otherwise, you end up
with the wasters.


310
00:30:31.401 --> 00:30:33.200
The lot you had before,

311
00:30:33.202 --> 00:30:34.869
they're cooling their
heels on another site.


312
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:37.438
Won't bother us again. Same
with the timber suppliers.


313
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.208
One of your friends at the
interview recommended them.


314
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.543
Perhaps he hadn't
thought it through.


315
00:30:42.545 --> 00:30:43.677
And you have?

316
00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.613
If you fail, we all fail.

317
00:30:46.715 --> 00:30:49.817
Not pretty, I'll grant,
but it's true.


318
00:30:52.053 --> 00:30:55.556
So... So, I learned
after some inquiries


319
00:30:55.558 --> 00:30:57.391
who had the commissions, and
everybody had good laborers


320
00:30:57.393 --> 00:30:58.893
coming out their ears
except you.


321
00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:00.761
Thanks to your friends
at the interview.


322
00:31:00.763 --> 00:31:02.630
Some men take
losing harder than others.


323
00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:04.565
I, on the other hand,
have a leviathan for a wife


324
00:31:04.567 --> 00:31:06.901
and am very used to being
on the losing end.


325
00:31:06.903 --> 00:31:08.936
She issued very
precise instructions


326
00:31:08.938 --> 00:31:10.538
which, as I say, I would
never dare go against.


327
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.705
Instructions?

328
00:31:11.707 --> 00:31:13.974
"Ask her for work."

329
00:31:13.976 --> 00:31:17.256
Well, a man snaps like a carrot
exposed to the leviathan.


330
00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:20.815
Besides, I have little ones.

331
00:31:21.883 --> 00:31:23.951
They make me proud,

332
00:31:23.953 --> 00:31:26.193
even if I am humbled elsewhere.

333
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:27.888
Can I take this off now?

334
00:31:35.564 --> 00:31:37.932
I've been issued
an invitation to the Louvre.


335
00:31:37.934 --> 00:31:39.600
Gracious me.

336
00:31:39.602 --> 00:31:41.602
Supper, too, I expect.
Very nice.


337
00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:44.004
Will there be others there?

338
00:32:34.556 --> 00:32:38.726
Versailles shall be
the heart of our kingdom,


339
00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:44.064
inhabited by the finest
examples of humanity,


340
00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:48.002
fit for the gods
of old to behold


341
00:32:48.004 --> 00:32:50.337
and finding
their echo in gardens


342
00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:54.875
where each new turn
brings another excitement.


343
00:32:55.877 --> 00:32:59.013
Fountains whose gentle flow

344
00:32:59.015 --> 00:33:03.250
is balm enough
to ease a ringing ear.


345
00:33:03.252 --> 00:33:08.856
Scented groves of orange blossom
blown by temperate winds.


346
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.106
What light,
what beauty, what hope.


347
00:33:27.442 --> 00:33:30.311
Versailles, Versailles,

348
00:33:31.513 --> 00:33:33.280
Versailles.

349
00:33:44.392 --> 00:33:45.659
Oh, pardon me.

350
00:33:58.206 --> 00:33:59.966
I believe this is
the way forward, <i>madame.</i>


351
00:34:05.213 --> 00:34:07.748
Some cool night air is, I think,

352
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.583
in order, <i>madame,</i> do you not?

353
00:34:09.585 --> 00:34:10.818
Oh.

354
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.386
Thank you.

355
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.990
Your first time
at court, <i>madame?</i>


356
00:34:15.992 --> 00:34:18.058
Is... Is that where I am?

357
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.220
Where did you imagine
yourself to be?


358
00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:22.496
Well, I don't know.

359
00:34:24.299 --> 00:34:27.668
A reception for
the gardeners of Versailles.


360
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.802
A sort of shed affair?

361
00:34:28.804 --> 00:34:30.337
How exquisite.

362
00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:32.039
A tiara amongst the weeds.

363
00:34:32.474 --> 00:34:34.308
I think I...

364
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.144
I have underestimated the event
on some level, <i>monsieur.</i>


365
00:34:37.146 --> 00:34:39.079
Antoine Nompar de Caumont,

366
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:41.582
Marquis de Puyguilhem,
Duc de Lauzun.


367
00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:44.184
Antoine.

368
00:34:45.954 --> 00:34:48.022
Sabine de Barra. Charmed.

369
00:34:48.024 --> 00:34:50.224
Now, let me give you
the grand tour.


370
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.162
What do you know of us,
<i>madame,</i> we mice in a trap?


371
00:34:56.431 --> 00:34:59.667
Not a thing, I'm sorry to say.

372
00:34:59.669 --> 00:35:02.469
Winter, summer, autumn,
spring, we are here.


373
00:35:02.471 --> 00:35:04.872
We may not leave without
permission of the king.


374
00:35:06.775 --> 00:35:08.709
Yes, mice in a trap.

375
00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:11.879
A small community, there's
only about 2,000 of us.


376
00:35:11.881 --> 00:35:14.314
Everybody knows everybody else.

377
00:35:14.316 --> 00:35:17.785
Everybody has worked
their way through the group.


378
00:35:17.787 --> 00:35:19.486
"Worked their way through"?

379
00:35:19.488 --> 00:35:22.890
Fought with, had an affair
with, that kind of thing.


380
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.565
Marquise de Montespan.
Late, as usual.


381
00:35:31.567 --> 00:35:33.901
She's the king's mistress. Has
at least four of his children,


382
00:35:33.903 --> 00:35:35.502
but his attention has wandered.

383
00:35:35.504 --> 00:35:37.571
Now there is a new star rising.

384
00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:39.640
Oh? <i>Madame</i> de Maintenon.

385
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:42.676
And she is here? 
Devoted to God.

386
00:35:42.678 --> 00:35:44.745
Never attends anything
as frivolous as a party,


387
00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:46.146
unlike some people.

388
00:35:46.148 --> 00:35:47.815
Don't look.
They're talking about us.


389
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:49.783
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

390
00:35:51.686 --> 00:35:52.686
You are...

391
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.289
Am I... Am I late?

392
00:35:55.924 --> 00:35:57.558
No.

393
00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.126
Early? No.

394
00:35:59.694 --> 00:36:00.694
What, then?

395
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.597
Here.

396
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:06.033
One of your gardeners? Perfect.

397
00:36:06.035 --> 00:36:08.602
I must accompany
the marquise to supper.


398
00:36:08.604 --> 00:36:10.604
I could surrender my new
friend into your care?


399
00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:12.072
Of course.

400
00:36:12.074 --> 00:36:13.373
Guard her well, <i>monsieur.</i>

401
00:36:13.375 --> 00:36:15.542
The vultures are circling.

402
00:36:15.544 --> 00:36:16.810
It has been my pleasure.

403
00:36:17.612 --> 00:36:18.746
<i>Madame?</i>

404
00:36:29.858 --> 00:36:31.925
It seems an extraordinary life.

405
00:36:34.062 --> 00:36:35.729
But you may come and go?

406
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:37.464
Oh, yes.

407
00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:39.900
I'm out and about.

408
00:36:39.902 --> 00:36:41.582
And now they're all
moving to Versailles.


409
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.771
To a village.

410
00:36:43.773 --> 00:36:45.906
Will you not join them?

411
00:36:45.908 --> 00:36:47.474
I would go slowly mad.

412
00:36:47.942 --> 00:36:49.910
Oh.

413
00:36:49.912 --> 00:36:53.152
Do they think of you as a
vegetable grower or something?


414
00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:56.216
You show no consideration
for my vanity, <i>madame.</i>


415
00:36:56.218 --> 00:36:58.152
I'm quite sure you possess none.

416
00:36:58.154 --> 00:37:01.288
What of you,
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra?


417
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.390
Are you prone?

418
00:37:03.392 --> 00:37:04.592
You remember my hat?

419
00:37:06.094 --> 00:37:07.995
It would be
impossible to forget.


420
00:37:07.997 --> 00:37:09.797
It was a considerable expense.

421
00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:11.298
And entirely unnecessary.

422
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.500
Nolly!

423
00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:15.235
My dear old cabbage!

424
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.104
<i>Monsieur.</i>

425
00:37:17.106 --> 00:37:20.440
Give me a kiss instantly or
I shall take grave offense.


426
00:37:20.442 --> 00:37:22.509
What a splendid hat.
Do you think so?


427
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:24.645
I'm trying it out,
I never wear a hat.


428
00:37:24.647 --> 00:37:26.380
No. Fear of squashing my wig.

429
00:37:26.981 --> 00:37:28.348
But who's this?

430
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.250
Dear lady, you are prostrate.
Allow me.


431
00:37:30.618 --> 00:37:32.452
May I present.

432
00:37:32.454 --> 00:37:35.455
His Royal Highness Philippe,
Duke of Orleans?


433
00:37:35.457 --> 00:37:38.158
Your Highness, this is
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra.


434
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.526
Delighted, <i>madame.</i>

435
00:37:39.528 --> 00:37:42.696
How is it that a woman
of such exquisite taste


436
00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:45.499
falls in with a clay
kicker like Andre here?


437
00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:49.269
I must confess to being a clay
kicker myself, Your Highness.


438
00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:51.438
I am working for
the master at Versailles.


439
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.840
I am unable to picture it.

440
00:37:52.842 --> 00:37:54.242
Do tell us
how it is that you are.


441
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:57.311
Oh. May I present
Marquis du Vasse?


442
00:37:57.313 --> 00:37:59.546
Master Le Notre, <i>Madame</i> de Barra.
Delighted.


443
00:37:59.548 --> 00:38:01.348
But the mystery remains, <i>madame.</i>

444
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.984
What is a woman of such
restrained sophistication


445
00:38:03.986 --> 00:38:05.319
doing with Nolly here?

446
00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:07.554
I speak from the opposite
end of the fashion scale.


447
00:38:07.556 --> 00:38:09.957
I don't apologize for it,
I like it about myself.


448
00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:11.792
Answer, <i>madame.</i> Stop me talking.

449
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:16.697
It was the only thing I
knew how to do, for money.


450
00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:19.466
And you enjoy your profession?
It stimulates you?


451
00:38:19.468 --> 00:38:21.168
It has seen me
through some very hard times


452
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.870
and allowed me
to be independent.


453
00:38:22.872 --> 00:38:24.037
Dearest!

454
00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:26.874
I simply do as I am told.

455
00:38:26.876 --> 00:38:29.743
Even down to marrying
large German women.


456
00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:31.845
Though, I confess, I like her
better than my last wife,


457
00:38:31.847 --> 00:38:34.414
who is dead as a
doornail now, thank God.


458
00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:37.584
Do kiss me, husband.
I am in need of affection.


459
00:38:39.721 --> 00:38:43.323
It is wonderful to have
access to one's spouse.


460
00:38:43.325 --> 00:38:44.658
My dear, we're being very rude.

461
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.693
Princess Palatine,
Duchess of Orleans,


462
00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:48.495
may I present
<i>Madame</i> de Barra, who...


463
00:38:48.497 --> 00:38:51.431
Nolly, what is <i>Madame</i>
de Barra engaged to do?

464
00:38:51.433 --> 00:38:53.567
Hold for this, my dear,
it will interest you.


465
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:56.436
She is to build a water
cascade at Versailles.


466
00:38:56.438 --> 00:38:58.572
Nothing like it will
exist in the gardens.


467
00:38:58.574 --> 00:39:00.240
How fascinating.

468
00:39:00.242 --> 00:39:02.409
I am a great admirer
of engineering.


469
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:04.077
<i>Madame,</i> you must promise
to show us.


470
00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:06.213
Perhaps Your Highnesses

471
00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:08.282
would care to take lunch
at the Louveciennes aqueduct?


472
00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:10.417
Is it in the country?

473
00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:12.920
I always disappear
in the country.


474
00:39:12.922 --> 00:39:15.255
But now that we are to move
out to Versailles,


475
00:39:15.257 --> 00:39:17.925
I shall become
a human jellyfish.


476
00:39:17.927 --> 00:39:19.559
A miserable, formless being.

477
00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:21.761
We should love to come,
Master Le Notre.


478
00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:26.500
Everybody should
really attend, I imagine.


479
00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:28.602
Come, <i>Madame</i> de Barra.

480
00:39:28.604 --> 00:39:31.238
Take a turnabout with me
and tell me of your scheme.


481
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.539
With pleasure, 
Your Highness.

482
00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:39.546
Well, Nolly, <i>Madame</i> de Barra has
certainly thrilled my dearest.


483
00:39:39.548 --> 00:39:43.417
Has she thrilled you also?

484
00:39:43.419 --> 00:39:46.586
She's very diverting and extremely
clever at what she does, I think.


485
00:39:46.588 --> 00:39:47.888
Do you indeed?

486
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.656
I am glad.

487
00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:51.158
Good man.

488
00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:01.702
Macaroon?

489
00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:03.804
Thank you, sire.

490
00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:10.410
My speech went
down well, I thought.


491
00:40:10.412 --> 00:40:12.346
It did.

492
00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:15.548
"The finest examples of
humanity" certainly enjoyed it.


493
00:40:18.987 --> 00:40:21.455
We may be building with stone, but
I can tell you it's a feather


494
00:40:21.457 --> 00:40:23.423
compared to the weight
of the state.


495
00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:28.295
My brother tells me
you're inviting


496
00:40:28.297 --> 00:40:30.764
new ideas into the gardens. Why?

497
00:40:30.766 --> 00:40:33.133
I've been persuaded
to expand my horizons.


498
00:40:33.135 --> 00:40:34.801
Have they been tested?

499
00:40:34.803 --> 00:40:36.723
They are, in my opinion,
appropriate.


500
00:40:37.972 --> 00:40:39.272
Appropriate?

501
00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:46.313
Last year, we had the Nymphs
and Shepherds costume party,


502
00:40:46.315 --> 00:40:49.449
and it was not a bit funny, all those
haggard faces under flaxen wigs.


503
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:50.884
We looked ancient.

504
00:40:50.886 --> 00:40:52.686
I want a window to perfection

505
00:40:52.688 --> 00:40:56.289
so that people can see
the very best of themselves.


506
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:58.525
We've grown too old for jokes.

507
00:41:00.194 --> 00:41:02.529
The work will be
original but balanced.


508
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:05.812
The responsibility will be mine.

509
00:41:06.534 --> 00:41:07.601
Yes.

510
00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:10.937
It will.

511
00:41:18.179 --> 00:41:19.179
<i>Andre.</i>

512
00:41:20.181 --> 00:41:22.581
I did not see you
there in the gloom.


513
00:41:28.423 --> 00:41:30.557
Did you enjoy your evening?

514
00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:33.293
As much, I imagine,
as you did yours.


515
00:41:41.402 --> 00:41:42.903
You were with that woman.

516
00:43:14.996 --> 00:43:16.329
Clear!

517
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.890
You are reckless, <i>madame.</i>

518
00:44:01.475 --> 00:44:05.145
Do you know that my husband
and the marquis are lovers?


519
00:44:05.147 --> 00:44:09.115
It has not stopped us having
children, and he loved them dearly.


520
00:44:10.484 --> 00:44:12.444
In battle, he's immensely brave.

521
00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:14.754
And he has a good heart.

522
00:44:15.823 --> 00:44:17.390
I am happy with my choice.

523
00:44:36.844 --> 00:44:38.284
<i>Another thing about the country</i>

524
00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:40.780
is the muck.

525
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.517
One encounters it everywhere.

526
00:44:45.286 --> 00:44:47.120
Or beasts making muck.

527
00:44:49.223 --> 00:44:51.324
The country is full of muck.

528
00:44:57.365 --> 00:45:00.645
I sometimes feel entirely
defeated by life's extremities.


529
00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:04.109
When I come to
a place like this,


530
00:45:04.772 --> 00:45:08.141
gradually, a small
courage takes hold of me


531
00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:09.676
and I feel fitter for things.

532
00:45:10.645 --> 00:45:12.165
Do you feel that way often?

533
00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.048
More so with time.

534
00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:22.155
Your wife does not
accompany you ever?


535
00:45:23.557 --> 00:45:26.760
That is, she does not
come out with you,


536
00:45:26.762 --> 00:45:29.562
other times, besides now?

537
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:34.134
You're very direct, <i>madame.</i>

538
00:45:41.676 --> 00:45:43.043
We have an arrangement.

539
00:45:45.146 --> 00:45:47.306
I feel disloyal in
discussing such matters.


540
00:45:49.817 --> 00:45:51.518
You are also married?

541
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:55.188
No.

542
00:45:57.291 --> 00:45:58.758
My husband died.

543
00:45:59.527 --> 00:46:00.767
I'm sorry.

544
00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:06.032
Today you said I was reckless,

545
00:46:06.034 --> 00:46:09.135
but to be reckless
is to abandon safety,


546
00:46:09.137 --> 00:46:14.040
but I think maybe it is
safety that has abandoned me.


547
00:46:30.224 --> 00:46:31.624
What is it?

548
00:46:34.995 --> 00:46:35.995
Nothing.

549
00:46:37.031 --> 00:46:38.031
It...

550
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:41.935
I would like to walk on.

551
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.770
Of course.

552
00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:47.907
Come.

553
00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:50.229
There's something
you should see.


554
00:47:04.225 --> 00:47:05.792
It's a shrine.

555
00:48:05.486 --> 00:48:08.321
The queen is dead.

556
00:48:42.156 --> 00:48:43.490
So kind.

557
00:48:43.492 --> 00:48:44.891
So quick.

558
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.360
Did you have fun
on your picnic, Andre?


559
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:14.220
I take it, <i>madame,</i>
you are unaware of events?


560
00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:15.555
Events?

561
00:49:16.357 --> 00:49:17.724
What do you mean, events?

562
00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:20.660
The queen is dead, <i>madame.</i>

563
00:49:20.662 --> 00:49:22.428
The queen? Is dead.

564
00:49:27.735 --> 00:49:29.335
The king could marry again?

565
00:49:29.337 --> 00:49:31.771
But no longer to your friend,
the marquise, I think.


566
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.274
I feel sorry for Montespan.

567
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:38.645
Tread carefully, <i>madame.</i>

568
00:49:52.493 --> 00:49:54.060
More on the wagon!

569
00:49:54.062 --> 00:49:55.562
No, the other one.

570
00:49:56.897 --> 00:49:58.331
I want the seasoned wood.

571
00:49:58.333 --> 00:49:59.732
Seasoned.

572
00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:10.176
Here, pass it here.

573
00:50:19.887 --> 00:50:21.120
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

574
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:27.961
Master.

575
00:50:28.796 --> 00:50:30.229
You've made some progress here.

576
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:32.198
I have a new foreman.

577
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.433
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

578
00:50:41.141 --> 00:50:43.810
We've had to drain the soil
below the fountain.


579
00:50:43.812 --> 00:50:46.112
The ground is waterlogged.

580
00:50:46.114 --> 00:50:48.274
It's a problem
common to the gardens.


581
00:51:18.178 --> 00:51:19.412
Thank you.

582
00:51:25.352 --> 00:51:27.487
Do you sometimes forget to eat?

583
00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:34.360
This is pâté from
<i>Madame</i> de la Tour.


584
00:51:34.362 --> 00:51:36.202
She feeds the ducks on seaweed.

585
00:51:38.966 --> 00:51:40.400
It was all she could afford.

586
00:51:41.135 --> 00:51:42.935
Virtue from necessity.

587
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.044
What amuses you?

588
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.980
There was an Irish woman
who died,


589
00:51:53.982 --> 00:51:56.949
and her husband
put on her tombstone,


590
00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:59.352
"Here lies Eleanor Fitzgerald."

591
00:51:59.354 --> 00:52:01.234
"Her virtues
exceeded her failings."


592
00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:04.457
How noble of him.

593
00:52:04.459 --> 00:52:06.259
You think he showed her
that before she died?


594
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:09.161
I'd have stuck
an arrow in his eye.


595
00:52:10.197 --> 00:52:11.931
Perhaps he was being truthful.

596
00:52:18.305 --> 00:52:19.539
How is the king?

597
00:52:22.042 --> 00:52:23.209
Shocked, I believe.

598
00:52:24.578 --> 00:52:27.313
Poor little Spanish woman.

599
00:52:27.315 --> 00:52:30.183
Has her head chopped off and
her organs laid out neatly.


600
00:52:30.185 --> 00:52:32.418
And all her friends,
her maids, everyone,


601
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.087
must gather around the table.

602
00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:38.725
Why would they
chop her head off?


603
00:52:38.727 --> 00:52:40.426
To see what she died of.

604
00:52:43.263 --> 00:52:46.183
You must attend the
funeral, I suppose?


605
00:52:51.405 --> 00:52:53.172
Well, I should go.

606
00:53:25.239 --> 00:53:26.773
It is I, King <i>Monsieur.</i>

607
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:28.307
May I?

608
00:53:30.377 --> 00:53:31.577
Come, then, brother.

609
00:53:33.247 --> 00:53:36.315
If the king does not eat,
France does not eat.


610
00:53:36.317 --> 00:53:38.417
I shall feed France,

611
00:53:38.419 --> 00:53:40.119
and you must put up with it.

612
00:53:40.121 --> 00:53:41.487
I'm not hungry.

613
00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:43.556
I have rose jellies.

614
00:53:49.997 --> 00:53:51.364
Have you lemon?

615
00:54:05.746 --> 00:54:07.547
I wish to go to Marly.

616
00:54:08.982 --> 00:54:11.217
And I wish to be alone.

617
00:54:43.517 --> 00:54:45.218
Try not to bend the tops.

618
00:56:56.316 --> 00:56:57.883
My beauties.

619
00:59:01.975 --> 00:59:03.215
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Quintinie?

620
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:10.616
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra.

621
00:59:11.985 --> 00:59:13.986
I'm very happy to meet you.

622
00:59:13.988 --> 00:59:17.223
I am directed by the Office
of Buildings of Versailles


623
00:59:17.225 --> 00:59:20.585
to order shrubs, such as I
require, from your good self.


624
00:59:22.229 --> 00:59:24.430
I have brought with me
a selection of perennials


625
00:59:24.432 --> 00:59:25.632
I thought we might exchange.

626
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.507
Is this the Four Seasons?

627
00:59:39.112 --> 00:59:40.513
Yes, I believe so.

628
00:59:42.582 --> 00:59:43.816
Mmm.

629
00:59:43.818 --> 00:59:44.818
Divine.

630
00:59:46.419 --> 00:59:47.920
Good color, too.

631
00:59:47.922 --> 00:59:50.356
You say you have
a selection of plants?


632
00:59:50.358 --> 00:59:52.191
I had them unloaded
into a little cart,


633
00:59:52.193 --> 00:59:54.493
intending to have
them conveyed here,


634
00:59:54.495 --> 00:59:56.595
but there seems to be
no one about.


635
00:59:56.597 --> 00:59:58.997
I wished to be alone,
I had them sent away.


636
00:59:59.432 --> 01:00:01.333
If you wish to be alone,
I could come back.


637
01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:03.035
No, no, no.

638
01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:06.437
I find you are the very
company I need today.


639
01:00:07.807 --> 01:00:11.443
Nothing would suit
me better than for me,


640
01:00:14.214 --> 01:00:15.781
the king's gardener,

641
01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:19.631
to take some advice
on perennials.


642
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.110
Allow me, <i>madame,</i> to assist you.

643
01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:27.359
Hmm.

644
01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:29.695
Most kind, <i>monsieur.</i>

645
01:00:33.233 --> 01:00:35.734
You are a devoted
pear man, master.


646
01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:38.690
I quite like them, not overly.

647
01:00:39.339 --> 01:00:40.706
Oh...

648
01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:43.542
I think the master is
playing a trick on me.


649
01:00:44.844 --> 01:00:46.078
A trick?

650
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.380
Well, yes, I do know
of your book on pears.


651
01:00:49.816 --> 01:00:51.283
My book on pears?

652
01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:57.256
Oh, yes, I have written
a book on pears.


653
01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:01.594
I believe I said I liked
them a lot in my book.


654
01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:03.629
I believe you did.

655
01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.765
And perennials.

656
01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:11.103
You like flowers, master?

657
01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:13.872
<i>Madame</i> de Barra, I love
all flowers passionately.


658
01:01:13.874 --> 01:01:16.242
However, I am banished from
using as many as I would like


659
01:01:16.244 --> 01:01:18.244
at Versailles by
the Master Le Notre.


660
01:01:18.246 --> 01:01:21.347
He indulges me in
a few small parterres.


661
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:23.515
I'd hoped to be able to convert
him when we took up residence.


662
01:01:23.517 --> 01:01:25.117
However...

663
01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:29.421
Oh!

664
01:01:31.558 --> 01:01:33.759
You're wise to me now, <i>madame.</i>

665
01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:40.866
May we ignore all that
and continue as before?


666
01:01:43.603 --> 01:01:45.671
Today, I am.

667
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.775
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Quintinie.

668
01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:50.809
Indeed.

669
01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:53.479
And you are.

670
01:01:58.718 --> 01:02:00.919
You are the better for the
move to Versailles, sire?


671
01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:02.755
Very much.

672
01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:04.590
It's good for the children
to be away from the city.


673
01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:07.426
I know it's a crush
for everybody.


674
01:02:07.428 --> 01:02:09.828
I felt, though, that I should
never get the builders out


675
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.231
unless I moved in.

676
01:02:12.233 --> 01:02:15.567
You are familiar with
builders, <i>Madame</i> de Barra?


677
01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:19.905
At present, I am building in
your gardens at Versailles.


678
01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:21.987
Which construction
would that be?


679
01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.742
The Rockwork Grove.

680
01:02:25.278 --> 01:02:26.812
I am familiar with it.

681
01:02:26.814 --> 01:02:29.782
I cannot claim it
entirely as my own.


682
01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:32.618
Master Le Notre took
a simple sketch of mine


683
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.021
and made it outstanding, so...

684
01:02:37.357 --> 01:02:39.992
You see my reluctance.

685
01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:41.827
You admire the master, <i>madame?</i>

686
01:02:45.298 --> 01:02:48.233
He is the most
complete person I know.


687
01:02:51.137 --> 01:02:54.239
You make me lonely for
someone to describe me thus.


688
01:03:00.547 --> 01:03:01.914
These are your flowers?

689
01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:41.587
My wife died recently.

690
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:42.955
Did you hear?

691
01:03:44.023 --> 01:03:45.223
I did, sire.

692
01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:50.429
I remember the day
of your marriage.


693
01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:51.964
I hope so, it cost enough.

694
01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:56.502
Though her father paid
for a large portion.


695
01:03:59.038 --> 01:04:01.573
Astray in his wits, bless him.

696
01:04:01.575 --> 01:04:03.409
A long bloodline,
never a good thing.


697
01:04:06.346 --> 01:04:08.947
She was an innocent, really.

698
01:04:12.085 --> 01:04:13.585
But she was nice.

699
01:04:15.755 --> 01:04:17.990
And devoted to me.

700
01:04:21.561 --> 01:04:23.595
I found this after she died.

701
01:04:26.466 --> 01:04:30.235
It's just an account
of our lives.


702
01:04:30.237 --> 01:04:32.704
The writing's like a child's.

703
01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.106
You see here?

704
01:04:35.642 --> 01:04:38.710
"Today I saved a flower
from His Majesty."


705
01:04:38.712 --> 01:04:40.345
And then the time and the place.

706
01:04:44.918 --> 01:04:47.386
This little woman's secret life.

707
01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.825
I feel the loss of it.

708
01:04:57.797 --> 01:04:59.637
I should like to marry again.

709
01:05:01.668 --> 01:05:04.203
This time someone I choose,

710
01:05:04.971 --> 01:05:06.071
not the state.

711
01:05:07.106 --> 01:05:08.941
Has Your Majesty
someone in mind?


712
01:05:08.943 --> 01:05:10.976
I have,
but the lady's very pious.


713
01:05:12.912 --> 01:05:17.483
Most evenings I stroll over to her
rooms, and we just sit and talk.


714
01:05:19.752 --> 01:05:22.154
But it is the
ease of it I like.

715
01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:25.991
The ease.

716
01:05:29.996 --> 01:05:32.297
Unfortunately,
she is of no birth,


717
01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:34.867
so, you see,
I am at a little impasse.


718
01:05:37.804 --> 01:05:40.939
If you were to be married to

719
01:05:41.508 --> 01:05:43.442
the lady of your choosing,

720
01:05:45.178 --> 01:05:48.514
would it be necessary
for everyone to know?


721
01:05:48.516 --> 01:05:52.417
If the ceremony were
private, between the couple,


722
01:05:55.221 --> 01:05:57.322
who would be in a position
to argue the outcome?


723
01:05:57.324 --> 01:06:00.724
They would be foolish to do so
afterwards, when it was done.


724
01:06:01.227 --> 01:06:02.294
Mmm.

725
01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:06.064
Yes.

726
01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:12.271
So much to contend.

727
01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:20.545
And what of you,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra?


728
01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:25.651
What pulse drives you?

729
01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:27.119
There is someone you love?

730
01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:30.789
I cannot say.

731
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:33.091
Why?

732
01:06:36.863 --> 01:06:39.865
Because...
Because of something private.


733
01:06:39.867 --> 01:06:42.868
What is so private that it
cannot be shared in love?


734
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.236
The time has come, <i>madame,</i>

735
01:06:45.772 --> 01:06:48.674
for us both
to face down our past


736
01:06:48.676 --> 01:06:50.809
and live in the present.

737
01:06:55.214 --> 01:06:58.417
I shall write a letter
from one gardener to another,


738
01:06:58.419 --> 01:07:02.521
shall we say,
in return for seeds sown.


739
01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:04.323
It will bring you to the court,

740
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.794
where my eye

741
01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.364
will always be on you.

742
01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:18.670
I shall not forget our day in
the garden, <i>Madame</i> de Barra.


743
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.289
Are you still fiddling
with your bits, Andre?


744
01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:38.490
It helps me think.

745
01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:40.158
For you.

746
01:07:40.793 --> 01:07:42.227
It has the fleur-de-lis.

747
01:07:45.965 --> 01:07:47.925
Is it from the king, I wonder?

748
01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.507
Is it an invitation?

749
01:07:57.844 --> 01:07:59.311
There is something
you need, <i>madame?</i>


750
01:07:59.313 --> 01:08:02.014
Andre? So secret?

751
01:08:02.016 --> 01:08:04.916
I must inform you,
since you ask,


752
01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:07.019
that I leave for Fontainebleau
at the end of the week.


753
01:08:07.021 --> 01:08:09.087
Fontainebleau?

754
01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:12.124
I was not aware
there were activities.


755
01:08:12.126 --> 01:08:13.825
The marquise
must have forgotten.


756
01:08:13.827 --> 01:08:16.161
I will travel there alone.

757
01:08:16.163 --> 01:08:18.497
Plainly, <i>madame,</i>
that is the position.


758
01:08:18.499 --> 01:08:19.831
If you will excuse me.

759
01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.302
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

760
01:08:24.304 --> 01:08:27.005
Is she an aspect of your
life I must now include?


761
01:08:27.007 --> 01:08:29.775
Andre, a builder?

762
01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:31.376
I'm a builder, <i>madame.</i>

763
01:08:31.378 --> 01:08:33.612
You are funded
by that profession.


764
01:08:33.614 --> 01:08:36.114
Very amusing.

765
01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:38.283
Perhaps that is the fantasy
between you and she.


766
01:08:38.285 --> 01:08:39.851
So be it.

767
01:08:39.853 --> 01:08:41.019
However, I must request that

768
01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:43.722
you keep it
separate from our lives.


769
01:08:43.724 --> 01:08:45.190
If this liaison
became common knowledge,


770
01:08:45.192 --> 01:08:46.324
it would make me
a laughingstock.


771
01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:47.859
It makes my flesh crawl.

772
01:08:47.861 --> 01:08:51.461
I remind you, <i>madame,</i> that it was
you who embarked on this path.


773
01:08:52.532 --> 01:08:56.068
You and only you
dictated how we live now,


774
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.302
and you did it, <i>madame,</i>

775
01:08:58.071 --> 01:08:59.304
when I needed you most.

776
01:08:59.306 --> 01:09:00.572
Andre.

777
01:09:04.043 --> 01:09:05.944
I feel us at the edge
of something here.


778
01:09:07.413 --> 01:09:08.880
I'm trying to pull us back.

779
01:09:08.882 --> 01:09:11.249
You knew the damage
you inflicted,


780
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:13.752
but you have been free to
live your life as you wished


781
01:09:13.754 --> 01:09:16.054
without embarrassment from me.

782
01:09:16.056 --> 01:09:19.336
I ask you now to extend
me the same courtesy.


783
01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.562
Andre, you must make
the sensible choice here.


784
01:09:23.564 --> 01:09:25.163
Do not exclude me, I beg you.

785
01:09:28.868 --> 01:09:30.135
I begged you once.

786
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:32.938
Do you remember?

787
01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.440
Allow me to give you the same
advice you gave me then.


788
01:09:35.442 --> 01:09:38.602
You said, "It is a matter
of feeling special."


789
01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:42.625
"If we are unable, one, to
make the other feel special,"


790
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:45.450
"we must just accept it,"

791
01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:46.918
"seek comfort elsewhere"

792
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.620
"with others."

793
01:09:49.889 --> 01:09:51.649
"It is an honest contract,
my dear."


794
01:09:52.592 --> 01:09:54.192
"You'll grow used to it."

795
01:09:55.361 --> 01:09:57.529
That is what you said.

796
01:10:25.258 --> 01:10:27.125
What's the root ball like?

797
01:10:28.427 --> 01:10:30.428
It's a bit dry.

798
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:31.630
Soak them overnight.

799
01:10:32.064 --> 01:10:33.565
You may not need to.

800
01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:34.900
Just secure them, then.

801
01:10:36.102 --> 01:10:37.302
We should cover these tiers.

802
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.480
I need more rope.

803
01:10:48.482 --> 01:10:49.548
I need more food.

804
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:51.917
In the warm.

805
01:10:51.919 --> 01:10:53.251
You go on, I'll follow.

806
01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:07.065
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

807
01:11:12.939 --> 01:11:14.372
My name is Le Notre.

808
01:11:20.613 --> 01:11:21.680
<i>Madame.</i>

809
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:25.450
Did you ever see someone

810
01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:27.892
and know that they were to
play a role in your life?


811
01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:30.255
You're a widow, I believe.

812
01:11:31.123 --> 01:11:32.891
How lonely that must be.

813
01:11:36.162 --> 01:11:40.565
I've known for some time that
Andre had some secret happiness,


814
01:11:40.567 --> 01:11:44.102
but my husband's ambitions
are married only to mine.


815
01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:46.705
You're not the first diversion,

816
01:11:46.707 --> 01:11:48.840
and I believe at the moment,

817
01:11:48.842 --> 01:11:50.042
not the only one.

818
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.491
You will come and you will go.

819
01:11:54.881 --> 01:11:57.082
Understand me, <i>madame.</i>

820
01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:00.285
It suits my
husband and I this way.


821
01:12:16.035 --> 01:12:17.302
Pretty thing.

822
01:12:45.398 --> 01:12:49.768
<i>We found the sluice gate that connects
the reservoir to the fountain.</i>


823
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:52.537
<i>If we fill it, the pressure
in the pipes will build,</i>


824
01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:53.972
<i>and we can flood the grove.</i>

825
01:12:57.209 --> 01:12:58.510
Do it.

826
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:05.317
Later.

827
01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:43.448
Use the wood to hold it down!

828
01:14:46.185 --> 01:14:47.986
The sluice gate must be open!

829
01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:49.421
We need more hands!

830
01:14:49.423 --> 01:14:50.588
Then pray.

831
01:14:51.924 --> 01:14:53.324
To hell with that.

832
01:16:56.015 --> 01:16:57.015
Thank you.

833
01:17:08.894 --> 01:17:09.894
Will it mend?

834
01:17:10.863 --> 01:17:12.063
It will mend.

835
01:17:14.166 --> 01:17:16.034
The tiers were too weak.

836
01:17:16.036 --> 01:17:17.735
The gate was left open.

837
01:17:17.737 --> 01:17:20.097
You cannot be blamed
for that, or the storm.


838
01:17:23.809 --> 01:17:25.310
What should I do?

839
01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:26.611
Adapt.

840
01:17:29.248 --> 01:17:31.282
Like a well-trained plant?

841
01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:33.985
Like a well-trained plant.

842
01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.628
Am I part
of an amusement for you?


843
01:17:45.064 --> 01:17:46.164
Not at all.

844
01:17:47.366 --> 01:17:49.067
I'm unused to all this.

845
01:17:53.005 --> 01:17:54.005
Is it honest?

846
01:17:56.275 --> 01:17:58.276
Are you? No.

847
01:18:00.446 --> 01:18:03.686
I have not been honest since
I watched you in my garden.


848
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.930
Your heart beats fiercely.
Mine just ticks.


849
01:18:10.389 --> 01:18:12.589
I have not gifts
to offer such a wonder.


850
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.161
If you are hungry,
I'll feed you.


851
01:18:19.064 --> 01:18:20.698
If I am mad, you will tell me.

852
01:18:21.734 --> 01:18:22.894
You are not mad.

853
01:18:24.403 --> 01:18:26.004
You don't know all of me yet.

854
01:18:31.944 --> 01:18:33.044
Are you hungry?

855
01:18:35.047 --> 01:18:36.147
Starving.

856
01:18:54.768 --> 01:18:56.234
Are you not happy?

857
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:58.903
Yes.

858
01:19:01.407 --> 01:19:03.247
That's what is making me cry.

859
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:19.490
I can't.

860
01:19:25.197 --> 01:19:26.531
I can't.

861
01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:27.865
Don't ask me.

862
01:20:23.489 --> 01:20:26.257
- What am I to say?
- "It is original"?


863
01:20:26.259 --> 01:20:28.426
"Continue indefinitely"?

864
01:20:28.428 --> 01:20:29.894
Do you expect that of us?

865
01:20:32.564 --> 01:20:34.665
You've been working
with <i>Madame</i> de Barra.


866
01:20:35.768 --> 01:20:38.503
Are you committed
to this design?


867
01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:40.338
If I may say, Your Majesty,

868
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.507
I was just as skeptical as you
are in the beginning, like.


869
01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:43.941
But now?

870
01:20:43.943 --> 01:20:45.743
I'm a convert, so to
speak, Your Majesty.


871
01:20:45.745 --> 01:20:48.246
Even now, the setbacks
were due to nature, sire.


872
01:20:48.248 --> 01:20:49.847
Perfection does
not bow to nature.


873
01:20:49.849 --> 01:20:52.216
What on earth are those things?

874
01:20:52.218 --> 01:20:54.852
Well, sire, I'm glad you asked
me that, because that, really,


875
01:20:54.854 --> 01:20:56.387
is what <i>Madame</i> de Barra is.

876
01:20:56.389 --> 01:20:57.588
Odd, sire.

877
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:58.823
May I show Your Majesty?

878
01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:12.970
You will recall what I said
about Nymphs and Shepherds.


879
01:21:12.972 --> 01:21:15.973
As we age,
we see things more clearly.


880
01:21:17.409 --> 01:21:18.843
This project,

881
01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.181
is it worthy of us?

882
01:21:28.887 --> 01:21:30.967
There's no precedent
for <i>Madame</i> de Barra's vision.


883
01:21:33.058 --> 01:21:35.960
Trust is all we can give to those
who reach into the new, sire.


884
01:21:38.464 --> 01:21:40.932
But when beauty can be described
with such imagination,


885
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.234
then her art, above all I know,

886
01:21:44.436 --> 01:21:46.137
is worthy of the king.

887
01:21:50.108 --> 01:21:51.876
I see only mud.

888
01:21:55.614 --> 01:21:57.415
Your words we will weigh later.

889
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:01.118
For now, inform <i>Madame</i> de Barra

890
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.987
that I shall see her
at Fontainebleau.


891
01:22:35.854 --> 01:22:37.421
I do not know

892
01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:40.525
what story this tells

893
01:22:41.326 --> 01:22:43.394
or what harm it is part of.

894
01:22:45.531 --> 01:22:47.851
This is a bad end
for both of us,


895
01:22:49.535 --> 01:22:50.968
and I am sorry for it.

896
01:23:44.957 --> 01:23:46.223
<i>Welcome to Fontainebleau.</i>

897
01:23:46.225 --> 01:23:48.125
Antoine. How beautiful you look.

898
01:23:49.761 --> 01:23:51.295
I believe it is compulsory.

899
01:23:51.297 --> 01:23:53.931
Indeed. However, some of the ladies
find it more of a challenge.


900
01:23:53.933 --> 01:23:57.068
I am bound to say, I see no
trace of that challenge in you.


901
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.102
Do not talk to me
about it, <i>madame.</i>


902
01:23:58.104 --> 01:24:00.237
I am ruined by the expense,
and worse,


903
01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:02.479
it is interfering
with my gaming.


904
01:24:03.976 --> 01:24:07.096
I must confess that escorting you
down is something of a coup.


905
01:24:07.779 --> 01:24:09.246
How so?

906
01:24:09.248 --> 01:24:11.448
There are several parties
who are anxious to meet you.


907
01:24:11.984 --> 01:24:13.384
I am no one.

908
01:24:13.386 --> 01:24:15.620
What could the interest be?

909
01:24:15.622 --> 01:24:16.954
<i>Madame,</i> you answer yourself.

910
01:24:17.889 --> 01:24:19.624
You see how they look at you?

911
01:24:19.626 --> 01:24:21.759
You are no one where
everybody is someone,


912
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:23.628
and yet you are here.

913
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.830
That makes you more the someone.

914
01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:27.732
Especially if you
have conversation.


915
01:24:27.734 --> 01:24:29.467
Words just tumble.

916
01:24:31.937 --> 01:24:33.604
You see?

917
01:24:33.606 --> 01:24:36.941
People are looking our way with
interest, because of my mirth.


918
01:24:36.943 --> 01:24:38.609
But the hordes may
not have you yet.


919
01:24:38.611 --> 01:24:41.812
I am under strict instruction to convey
you to one person in particular.


920
01:24:41.814 --> 01:24:43.481
The Marquise de Montespan.

921
01:24:43.483 --> 01:24:46.651
Heavens, the lengths
I've had to go to, <i>madame.</i>


922
01:24:46.653 --> 01:24:50.588
I have had to bribe, lie and use
every form of deception to meet you.


923
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:52.023
How much did you pay
the maître d'hôtel?


924
01:24:52.025 --> 01:24:53.491
Five gold louis.
Was that too much?


925
01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:54.859
Money well spent.

926
01:24:54.861 --> 01:24:56.861
Lauzun, I love you dearly.

927
01:24:56.863 --> 01:24:59.597
Kiss me now and leave me
to explore my prize.


928
01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:01.599
I shall enjoy you later.

929
01:25:01.601 --> 01:25:03.634
<i>Madame.</i> Good fortune
at the tables.


930
01:25:03.636 --> 01:25:05.703
I feel lucky tonight.

931
01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:08.439
My dearest friend
and a most divine lover.


932
01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:09.674
What can I say, <i>madame?</i>

933
01:25:09.676 --> 01:25:12.677
Events overtook us before
I had the king's interest.


934
01:25:12.679 --> 01:25:14.612
Is this your first time
at Fontainebleau?


935
01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:16.447
It is. Have you no birth?

936
01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:18.649
Not a drop. No blood whatsoever.

937
01:25:18.651 --> 01:25:21.052
You are here entirely
on your own merits.


938
01:25:21.054 --> 01:25:22.286
I know a famous man.

939
01:25:22.288 --> 01:25:23.454
Ah, I see.

940
01:25:23.456 --> 01:25:24.555
I was going to offer you Lauzun,

941
01:25:24.557 --> 01:25:25.656
but you're ahead of the game.

942
01:25:25.658 --> 01:25:28.092
Athenais. Palatine.

943
01:25:31.496 --> 01:25:33.397
And <i>Madame</i> de Barra.

944
01:25:33.399 --> 01:25:35.359
I'm so happy to see you again.

945
01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:37.001
Princess.

946
01:25:37.003 --> 01:25:38.636
Oh, please, call me <i>madame.</i>

947
01:25:38.638 --> 01:25:40.404
It's affectionate,
and everybody does.


948
01:25:40.406 --> 01:25:42.707
Come. My secret space.

949
01:25:49.715 --> 01:25:52.216
Do you dig earth? Yes.

950
01:25:52.218 --> 01:25:54.685
Yet you're not
blackened by the sun.


951
01:25:54.687 --> 01:25:55.920
Perhaps a little.

952
01:25:55.922 --> 01:25:58.823
And never had the smallpox.
Your skin is clear.


953
01:25:58.825 --> 01:26:01.425
Show us your breasts.
Are they pretty?


954
01:26:01.427 --> 01:26:03.494
Would you like to see mine?
Mine are the most beautiful.


955
01:26:03.496 --> 01:26:06.931
Yes, they are, apart
from Suzanne, who's 70.


956
01:26:06.933 --> 01:26:09.033
Oh, yes, hers are perfect.

957
01:26:09.035 --> 01:26:12.336
You see, here, touch. Oh!

958
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.174
Your eyes
are the color of the sea.


959
01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:19.610
This gown is cut differently.

960
01:26:19.612 --> 01:26:20.878
I like it at the waist.

961
01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.513
Are you married?

962
01:26:22.515 --> 01:26:24.782
Widowed. Did you
like your husband?


963
01:26:24.784 --> 01:26:26.250
- Yes.
- Children?


964
01:26:29.888 --> 01:26:31.188
Dead?

965
01:26:32.257 --> 01:26:33.324
A girl.

966
01:26:35.393 --> 01:26:36.593
How old?

967
01:26:38.296 --> 01:26:39.930
Six.

968
01:26:39.932 --> 01:26:42.333
Palatine has lost her son, too.

969
01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:46.303
He was four.

970
01:26:47.205 --> 01:26:48.873
So little and beautiful.

971
01:26:49.574 --> 01:26:51.442
Charles was one.

972
01:26:51.444 --> 01:26:53.604
I lost Joan and Ann together.

973
01:26:54.279 --> 01:26:56.046
Smallpox.

974
01:26:56.048 --> 01:26:59.116
I lost my husband and my
son on the battlefield.


975
01:26:59.118 --> 01:27:01.358
They died in each other's arms.

976
01:27:02.988 --> 01:27:04.221
I'm barely here.

977
01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:06.791
How did they die?

978
01:27:10.162 --> 01:27:11.829
Do you find it
hard to speak of it?


979
01:27:13.165 --> 01:27:14.398
That can happen.

980
01:27:18.837 --> 01:27:20.304
I put everything in a trunk.

981
01:27:23.074 --> 01:27:25.075
All their clothes, shoes,

982
01:27:26.611 --> 01:27:28.145
her toys.

983
01:27:29.514 --> 01:27:32.016
I haven't had the courage
to go in there since.


984
01:27:35.821 --> 01:27:38.455
When you are strong
enough, my dear,


985
01:27:38.457 --> 01:27:40.991
when you are strong enough.

986
01:27:40.993 --> 01:27:43.194
We're not allowed to
speak of death at court.


987
01:27:44.796 --> 01:27:46.497
The king does not like it,

988
01:27:46.499 --> 01:27:48.599
but we speak about it
amongst ourselves.


989
01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:52.436
Nobody may ban a child
from its mother's heart.


990
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:59.009
I commended all my children
into Maintenon's care.


991
01:27:59.011 --> 01:28:01.078
How she has turned on me now.

992
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:06.383
Saintly old bitch.

993
01:28:06.385 --> 01:28:10.287
It is an amazement to me a
convent has not claimed her.


994
01:28:10.289 --> 01:28:11.956
Costume's not as lavish.

995
01:28:14.794 --> 01:28:16.260
Oh. The king comes.

996
01:28:17.729 --> 01:28:19.409
Have you been presented before?

997
01:28:20.232 --> 01:28:21.365
No.

998
01:28:57.235 --> 01:28:59.403
Your Majesty, it is my pleasure

999
01:28:59.405 --> 01:29:01.565
to present <i>Madame</i> de Barra.

1000
01:29:03.608 --> 01:29:04.728
<i>Madame.</i>

1001
01:29:08.013 --> 01:29:09.179
Your Majesty.

1002
01:29:13.952 --> 01:29:15.452
Is it a Four Seasons?

1003
01:29:16.721 --> 01:29:18.489
It is, sire.

1004
01:29:19.724 --> 01:29:21.992
For the most famous
gardener in the world.


1005
01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:26.997
Allow me,

1006
01:29:27.699 --> 01:29:28.999
Your Majesty.

1007
01:29:37.475 --> 01:29:39.810
A light, honest scent.

1008
01:29:43.048 --> 01:29:45.215
Natural and unforced.

1009
01:29:48.753 --> 01:29:50.873
Some of the roses seem faded

1010
01:29:51.656 --> 01:29:53.324
and overblown.

1011
01:30:00.465 --> 01:30:02.399
That fate awaits
all roses, sire.


1012
01:30:07.339 --> 01:30:08.739
Continue, <i>madame.</i>

1013
01:30:10.608 --> 01:30:13.477
All roses are open to the
elements, Your Majesty.


1014
01:30:14.312 --> 01:30:16.513
They bud, bloom and fade.

1015
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.818
Is that so, <i>madame?</i>

1016
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.854
The rose grows entirely unaware,

1017
01:30:23.856 --> 01:30:27.658
changing naturally
from one state to another,


1018
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.794
and although the elements
may treat her cruelly,


1019
01:30:30.796 --> 01:30:34.131
she knows nothing of it
and continues to her end


1020
01:30:34.133 --> 01:30:36.100
without judgment on her beauty.

1021
01:30:37.535 --> 01:30:41.005
Alas, 'tis not the same for us.

1022
01:30:43.608 --> 01:30:45.843
If such a rose could speak,

1023
01:30:48.146 --> 01:30:49.546
what would she say?

1024
01:30:52.283 --> 01:30:53.951
Yes, I am here

1025
01:30:55.286 --> 01:30:57.521
and gave service
under nature's eye,


1026
01:30:58.623 --> 01:31:01.792
and after me,
my children will be.


1027
01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:06.397
Is there any greater contribution
or more graceful end?


1028
01:31:08.133 --> 01:31:09.600
A wise rose.

1029
01:31:14.506 --> 01:31:18.675
And what protection can the
gardener afford this rose


1030
01:31:18.677 --> 01:31:20.878
from the harsh
elements of change?


1031
01:31:22.047 --> 01:31:23.881
Patience, care

1032
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:27.084
and a little warmth from the sun

1033
01:31:27.086 --> 01:31:28.552
are our best hope, Your Majesty.

1034
01:31:44.335 --> 01:31:47.571
I'm obliged to you, <i>madame,</i>
for that sweet reminder.


1035
01:31:55.046 --> 01:31:56.580
Now walk with me.

1036
01:31:59.084 --> 01:32:04.021
And tell me of your
progress in our garden.


1037
01:32:31.549 --> 01:32:33.383
Her kindness,

1038
01:32:33.985 --> 01:32:35.619
unbribed.

1039
01:32:48.299 --> 01:32:50.339
That was very brave tonight.

1040
01:32:52.804 --> 01:32:54.238
I hoped he might listen.

1041
01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.472
Enough humility.

1042
01:36:13.104 --> 01:36:14.504
There you are.

1043
01:36:16.207 --> 01:36:17.441
Philippe.

1044
01:36:27.452 --> 01:36:28.552
You're dressed.

1045
01:36:28.554 --> 01:36:30.987
I'm off on business to Chartres.

1046
01:36:30.989 --> 01:36:32.989
Thought I would
take Marie-Claire.


1047
01:36:32.991 --> 01:36:34.751
There's a good puppet
stand and a pie shop.


1048
01:36:37.195 --> 01:36:38.829
Marie
-Claire! Are you there?

1049
01:36:38.831 --> 01:36:41.365
Papa! Did you find her?

1050
01:36:41.367 --> 01:36:44.401
Here is Belle Boobie
asleep with Mama.


1051
01:36:44.403 --> 01:36:46.336
Hello, Marie
-Claire.

1052
01:36:46.338 --> 01:36:47.537
You naughty doll!

1053
01:36:47.539 --> 01:36:49.299
Come here and I
shall punish you.


1054
01:36:51.042 --> 01:36:52.976
Oh, my goodness.
Is she all right?


1055
01:36:52.978 --> 01:36:55.178
Don't be silly.
She's made of cloth.


1056
01:36:59.851 --> 01:37:01.371
Sabine, I have
something to tell you.


1057
01:37:03.521 --> 01:37:04.721
<i>How long?</i>

1058
01:37:04.723 --> 01:37:05.923
<i>We've not been close of late.</i>

1059
01:37:07.558 --> 01:37:11.261
And most men take mistresses in
due course in such circumstances.


1060
01:37:11.263 --> 01:37:12.503
Such circumstances?

1061
01:37:14.532 --> 01:37:15.899
What's her name?

1062
01:37:17.201 --> 01:37:18.602
Diane.

1063
01:37:18.604 --> 01:37:19.770
Where does she live?

1064
01:37:21.205 --> 01:37:22.205
Berry.

1065
01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.507
Oh.

1066
01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:25.942
Not too far.

1067
01:37:28.179 --> 01:37:29.346
There's the coach now.

1068
01:37:30.415 --> 01:37:31.848
We'll talk again on this matter.

1069
01:37:36.387 --> 01:37:37.687
When will you be back?

1070
01:37:39.524 --> 01:37:41.291
This evening, <i>madame.</i>

1071
01:37:41.293 --> 01:37:44.261
Do not <i>"madame"</i> me, Philippe.

1072
01:37:51.636 --> 01:37:55.372
Marie-Claire, tie your laces.
You'll fall over them.


1073
01:37:55.374 --> 01:37:57.674
I can't, Mama. Wait there.

1074
01:38:02.747 --> 01:38:04.214
Master, look at this.

1075
01:38:07.952 --> 01:38:09.186
Marie
-Claire.

1076
01:38:10.721 --> 01:38:12.622
Marie
-Claire.

1077
01:38:15.426 --> 01:38:16.960
Jean, the wheel.

1078
01:38:16.962 --> 01:38:18.795
I told the master.

1079
01:38:18.797 --> 01:38:20.117
He said it would do until Berry.

1080
01:38:21.265 --> 01:38:22.666
Berry?

1081
01:38:26.337 --> 01:38:28.472
Marie
-Claire!

1082
01:38:28.474 --> 01:38:29.873
I did not kiss Mama.

1083
01:38:45.323 --> 01:38:47.190
Stop! Stop!

1084
01:39:01.172 --> 01:39:02.439
No, no!

1085
01:39:15.953 --> 01:39:19.523
No! No!

1086
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:21.458
Sabine!

1087
01:39:38.175 --> 01:39:40.877
She was the most
beautiful thing I ever made,


1088
01:39:40.879 --> 01:39:42.079
and I killed her.

1089
01:39:47.351 --> 01:39:50.053
Did you intend them to die?
Is that what you planned?


1090
01:39:51.422 --> 01:39:53.490
It was...
It was your husband's choice.


1091
01:39:53.492 --> 01:39:54.824
He took away the child.

1092
01:39:54.826 --> 01:39:56.092
No, it was my fault.

1093
01:39:56.094 --> 01:39:58.995
It was my fault.
I let him take her away.


1094
01:39:58.997 --> 01:40:01.431
What if no one
person is to blame?


1095
01:40:01.433 --> 01:40:02.866
And what use is blame?

1096
01:40:02.868 --> 01:40:04.067
It is enough to
have it happen to you.


1097
01:40:04.069 --> 01:40:05.949
It is enough to recover from it.

1098
01:40:07.872 --> 01:40:09.539
That is as much as we
may ask of ourselves.


1099
01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:10.941
That is enough.

1100
01:40:17.214 --> 01:40:19.054
What is it that would help you?

1101
01:40:20.418 --> 01:40:21.985
If you held me.

1102
01:40:36.767 --> 01:40:38.887
What will happen to your wife?

1103
01:40:44.809 --> 01:40:46.369
This was not the way we started.

1104
01:40:49.647 --> 01:40:51.982
So we must have taught
each other how to behave.


1105
01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.721
I am to blame for it
as much as she.


1106
01:41:03.628 --> 01:41:05.462
She will live her own life.

1107
01:41:07.064 --> 01:41:08.632
She knows that now.

1108
01:41:12.903 --> 01:41:14.204
And us?

1109
01:41:18.843 --> 01:41:20.243
We will shape each other.

1110
01:41:47.038 --> 01:41:48.772
This isn't the right way.

1111
01:41:48.774 --> 01:41:51.441
Yes, it is. We're
behind that fence. Oh!


1112
01:41:52.209 --> 01:41:53.610
For heaven's sake!

1113
01:41:54.512 --> 01:41:56.279
I have to rent this.

1114
01:41:56.281 --> 01:41:57.847
Waste of money!

1115
01:41:57.849 --> 01:41:59.015
What do you mean?

1116
01:41:59.017 --> 01:42:01.117
No one will see us.

1117
01:42:01.119 --> 01:42:03.753
The music comes
from the heavens.


1118
01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:54.104
Fair winds, Sabine.

1119
01:43:06.951 --> 01:43:09.031
<i>Madame</i> is lucky in her friends.

1120
01:44:22.927 --> 01:44:24.027
He loves it.

1121
01:45:46.944 --> 01:45:48.184
Do I look very flushed?

1122
01:45:49.947 --> 01:45:51.347
No, you look beautiful.

1123
01:45:51.349 --> 01:45:52.682
Are you flattering me?

1124
01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:54.490
Is that wrong?

1125
01:45:56.587 --> 01:45:58.121
Call me <i>madame</i> again.
