1
00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:29.437
Okay Pop, hello buddy.

2
00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:31.689
Hello lions. What are you doin'?

3
00:05:31.856 --> 00:05:34.025
What's that rogue,
Togar doin' here?


4
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.321
God Togar, why
today of all days?


5
00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:55.088
Okay, come on. 
Let's play chase.

6
00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:16.693
The closer we
get, more excited I get.


7
00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:17.962
It should be great seeing him

8
00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:18.987
after three years.

9
00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:20.530
Yeah, I
couldn't believe how fast


10
00:06:20.738 --> 00:06:23.449
he split for Africa
after he got his grants.


11
00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.785
And the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised.


12
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:27.829
You'd think he'd
take the kids he raised.


13
00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:29.265
Well he
was going to send for us,


14
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.082
but he said it
was too dangerous.


15
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.835
He certainly didn't leave
because he didn't love us.


16
00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:35.437
And you know how
depressed he used to get


17
00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.798
with his cats kept in
cages all the time.


18
00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.011
I wonder where he is.

19
00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:44.929
Why don't we try to
find our own way there?


20
00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:46.431
You're joking.

21
00:06:46.598 --> 00:06:50.977
Where could he be?

22
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.915
Boy you guys wait 'til my
family gets here tonight.


23
00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.775
Are they gonna love you.

24
00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.400
Oops, sorry Hank.

25
00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:40.929
And I thought you
came to help me.


26
00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:42.028
I did.

27
00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:43.881
I came to speak for you
with that committee,


28
00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:45.490
and take you to
pick up your family.


29
00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.659
Well come on ashore a while.

30
00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.160
Are you crazy?

31
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.872
The committee is on their
way here to renew your grant.


32
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:54.332
Monster.

33
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.834
Come on, you gotta
help me clean the house.


34
00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:58.878
Mmm, not today;
today doesn't seem like


35
00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:01.881
a good day to come in.

36
00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:05.760
Hey where are you going?

37
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:14.894
Not my jacket!

38
00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:25.947
Throw it here.
Come on over here.


39
00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:34.038
Stay
there. How's she doing?


40
00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.290
Look.

41
00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:41.837
This is a madhouse.

42
00:08:41.963 --> 00:08:43.506
No it isn't. It's
just like life.


43
00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:45.675
You get the funny
with the tragic.


44
00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:46.963
It's just with them you get

45
00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:48.289
the gentle and
the ferocious too.


46
00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:51.597
Be careful of the bad,
and enjoy the good.


47
00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:52.804
You aren't careful enough.

48
00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:54.118
Well for my
studies I have to get


49
00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:58.479
as close to them as possible.

50
00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:01.232
You know, actually, the
closer you get to them,


51
00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:04.736
the more they'd like you
and the safer you'd be.


52
00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.238
But look! He's
going to jump on us.


53
00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:11.242
No no no no,
they're just playing.


54
00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:14.746
They like to play the
old cat and mouse game.


55
00:09:14.912 --> 00:09:15.912
Here I'll cover ya.

56
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.708
Oh big John.

57
00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:22.712
No, if you just look at
'em, or you run at em.


58
00:09:25.214 --> 00:09:26.716
No look.

59
00:09:26.883 --> 00:09:31.554
What? Oh ah ah ah ah,
you leave him alone.


60
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.645
Oh that's Johnny Lion, you
never have to worry about John.


61
00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.648
Are you scaring him?

62
00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:44.942
You know you gotta
watch out for Mark.


63
00:09:45.109 --> 00:09:48.446
No, he's okay. 
This is Charlie.

64
00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.074
And you gotta watch
out for Barry, okay?


65
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.956
It's just playing
I'm tellin' ya.


66
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.500
But you could get killed.

67
00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:04.587
The cats got a little
excited, that's all.


68
00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.971
Are you
okay? You're crazy.


69
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:20.186
Oh Mativo, there's Robbie.

70
00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.979
You've never met Robbie.

71
00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:23.648
He's always out
guarding his borders


72
00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:25.233
in the daytime,

73
00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.799
and you're always
too afraid to come


74
00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.653
and visit me at night.

75
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.448
Now he's the nicest
cat in the world.


76
00:10:32.657 --> 00:10:35.618
And he's also the top cat here.

77
00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:37.745
Yeah. He's the boss.

78
00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.247
I work for him.

79
00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:40.455
Hey Rob,

80
00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:46.003
Well come here. I want
you to meet Mativo.


81
00:10:48.673 --> 00:10:50.800
See actually it's Robby
I'm worried about.


82
00:10:51.008 --> 00:10:55.179
Their whole life is
based on dominance.


83
00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:57.348
That's why we have such
a great harmony here,


84
00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:01.227
because Robbie is such a
gentle and loving ruler.


85
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:09.026
He also knows he has to protect
the others from outsiders.


86
00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.946
Right now he's very
worried about Togar.


87
00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:14.991
He's also worried that if the
others see that he's worried


88
00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:19.787
or afraid, that then they'll
start challenging him


89
00:11:19.954 --> 00:11:23.124
like they've been
each other all day.


90
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:29.255
No matter how afraid
he is at this moment,


91
00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:32.925
he still knows he has
to see this through.


92
00:11:33.885 --> 00:11:37.722
The whole meaning of his
life is before him, Mativo.


93
00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:44.854
That's why you have to help me.

94
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:46.981
I have to what? Why?

95
00:11:47.148 --> 00:11:49.817
Because I have to
help him, Mativo.


96
00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:55.114
And he could get killed.

97
00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:00.536
Don't worry, I'm gonna help ya.

98
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:04.790
I don't think you
should count on me.


99
00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.501
But Only yesterday
they were so happy.


100
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.878
Now look at them.

101
00:12:09.086 --> 00:12:10.838
Finally on the verge
of finding paradise,


102
00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:12.567
and the only thing
lacking is my family


103
00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:13.466
to share it with me.

104
00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.468
And Togar comes in wrecking it.

105
00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:17.094
Here comes trouble.

106
00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:21.682
It's a grand committee,
but Prentiss is with them.


107
00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:29.023
Listen my friend, let me talk.

108
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.901
Good morning everybody.

109
00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:33.295
I would like to
open this meeting


110
00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:36.572
by reminding you all that

111
00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:39.825
Hank's original idea
was a comparative study


112
00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:42.578
of the great cats of the wild.

113
00:12:42.787 --> 00:12:45.581
And while observing
the African cats


114
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.210
in their natural habitat,
he will raise several cats


115
00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:51.671
of each species.

116
00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:55.049
Be they African or otherwise.

117
00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:58.844
And to become almost like
a member of the pride.


118
00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:03.933
Hey it has stripes! It must
be another Tigon or a Liger.


119
00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.729
The mother's a lioness,
the father must be a tiger.


120
00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:10.648
Say hello to Henry
the Jaguar, would ya?


121
00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:11.856
Not today.

122
00:13:14.986 --> 00:13:16.696
What are you trying to prove?

123
00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:18.864
That you can have lions
socializing with people?


124
00:13:19.073 --> 00:13:21.492
No, but we can't keep
exterminating them.


125
00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:24.286
We can't keep
eliminating their land.


126
00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:25.997
We can't keep
exterminating everything


127
00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.833
that we fear, or that
inconveniences us.


128
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.710
Let the zoos keep them alive.

129
00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:33.421
Prentiss, your actions
aren't necessary.


130
00:13:33.587 --> 00:13:35.023
The government knows
there's a better way.


131
00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:35.798
They're moving the people out of

132
00:13:36.007 --> 00:13:37.800
the migration paths.

133
00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:39.236
I don't know what kind of person

134
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.780
could look in the
eyes of 200 elephants


135
00:13:40.845 --> 00:13:42.805
and put out those lights.

136
00:13:43.014 --> 00:13:44.223
They run frantically in panic

137
00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:45.752
trying to protect
their children--


138
00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:46.994
Do you think your lions
would run and panic?


139
00:13:47.018 --> 00:13:48.686
You better start with me first.

140
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.564
No I'll start with
the tigers first.


141
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.692
That'll teach you for
bringing them to Africa.


142
00:14:01.866 --> 00:14:06.704
I gotta go help your uncles;
they're killing each other.


143
00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:16.881
Stop it! Stop It! Hey! Hey!

144
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:22.970
Calm down!

145
00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:34.148
Togar!

146
00:14:48.913 --> 00:14:51.415
Togar! Togar!

147
00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:18.943
You stay out of it. You let
Robbie take care of him.


148
00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:22.238
Yeah, you guys are smart;
you stayed out of it.


149
00:15:22.446 --> 00:15:25.616
Oh Craig, hi Tommy, Jimmy.

150
00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:29.745
Oh aw. You hide in here?

151
00:15:33.457 --> 00:15:37.962
I don't blame you, all
those guys are fighting.


152
00:16:17.626 --> 00:16:20.504
Over the
side! This way! Git!


153
00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:26.802
That's my jacket.

154
00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:45.779
Help!

155
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.370
Hank!

156
00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.923
Hank get out here!

157
00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:24.401
Hank! Hank!

158
00:17:31.825 --> 00:17:33.869
Hank get out here!

159
00:17:57.935 --> 00:17:59.812
Get him off me!

160
00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:10.113
Run!

161
00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.909
Woah hey.

162
00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:40.602
Come on, go in the house
and get some bandages.


163
00:18:40.811 --> 00:18:42.438
Oh what the hell's
wrong with you?


164
00:18:42.646 --> 00:18:44.815
All you got's a few scratches.

165
00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:47.234
You're lucky Togar
didn't getcha.


166
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:57.745
I think you should take our bus.

167
00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:58.704
It goes right by there.

168
00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.707
Oh no, well I
think we should wait.


169
00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.210
No; if you wait until
tonight, and it doesn't come,


170
00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:07.087
there is no other
bus for two days.


171
00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:11.717
And there is no place
for you to stay here.


172
00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.970
Well what'll we do?

173
00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:19.016
Will he know where to take us?

174
00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:23.854
Oh come on. I'll
tell him for you.


175
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:48.045
Hey, she's dry.
Alice has no milk.


176
00:19:48.212 --> 00:19:49.838
Listen, I have to go change.

177
00:19:50.005 --> 00:19:51.005
I'll go back to my boat.

178
00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:52.048
Okay.

179
00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:53.926
Maybe I'll come with you.

180
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:02.059
If he claws ya--

181
00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.644
What do I do now?

182
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.354
just stand up to
them, don't let them


183
00:20:05.562 --> 00:20:06.688
get away with anything.

184
00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:08.649
You gotta let 'em see
how strong you are.


185
00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:11.360
Come on lions. We have to
clean the house for Madelaine.


186
00:20:11.527 --> 00:20:12.820
Come on lions.

187
00:20:17.408 --> 00:20:18.450
Come on lions.

188
00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.869
Come on Diane. 
Come on Michael.

189
00:20:21.078 --> 00:20:23.622
Come on Patrick.

190
00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:29.169
Are you sure there aren't
any more big ones in here?


191
00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:38.345
Well hello Gary.

192
00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:40.965
Why didn't you go with your--

193
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:44.291
Why didn't you go
with your friends?


194
00:20:48.522 --> 00:20:50.566
Come on, you should
go with your friends.


195
00:20:56.864 --> 00:20:57.865
Aw come on.

196
00:20:58.073 --> 00:20:59.273
You really changed this place.

197
00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.785
New curtains, new
drapes, new everything.


198
00:21:01.952 --> 00:21:04.371
Come on, go with your friends.

199
00:21:05.956 --> 00:21:07.916
Come on. Oh yes.

200
00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.668
You have to go
with your friends.


201
00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.628
Come on.

202
00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:20.637
Come on.

203
00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:24.850
Aw don't worry Davie.
Robbie can handle Togar.


204
00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:28.770
Your father's tougher
than you think.


205
00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:31.857
Come on.

206
00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:34.234
Oh come on, you'll hurt my hand.

207
00:21:37.321 --> 00:21:38.697
See I got a hand hurt.

208
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:46.872
Come on. Come on Davie.

209
00:21:57.925 --> 00:22:01.136
I think I drove Togar as
far away as 200 miles.


210
00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:04.264
This is the first
time he's come in.


211
00:22:04.473 --> 00:22:05.873
I have a hunch that
Robbie and Togar


212
00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.768
could be brothers.

213
00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:10.395
You know Bugsy and Robbie
were both rogue lions.


214
00:22:10.604 --> 00:22:12.814
I found them dying
from battle wounds.


215
00:22:13.023 --> 00:22:14.733
Now if Togar were sick or dying,

216
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.402
these guys'd
probably accept him.


217
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:18.862
But the way he is now, --

218
00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.071
Vicious alright.

219
00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:21.615
Well he can't help that.

220
00:22:21.782 --> 00:22:24.409
As a loner he's too slow to
catch his normal dinners.


221
00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:26.995
And the hungrier he gets,
the more desperate he gets.


222
00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:29.706
The more desperate he gets,
the more ferocious he gets,


223
00:22:29.873 --> 00:22:32.417
because the only way he
can eat most of the time


224
00:22:32.626 --> 00:22:36.630
is by taking his meals
from whole prides of lions.


225
00:22:36.797 --> 00:22:38.674
You gotta be pretty
ferocious to do that.


226
00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:43.303
Sooner or later, he's
gonna get killed.


227
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.597
Come on Gary.

228
00:23:08.996 --> 00:23:11.373
Billy.

229
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.295
Hey, don't try to frighten me.

230
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:18.714
Leave that alone!

231
00:23:18.922 --> 00:23:21.967
That's my jacket!

232
00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:28.098
Hey Hank, come and help me.

233
00:23:28.265 --> 00:23:32.853
He's got my jacket!

234
00:23:33.061 --> 00:23:36.356
Gimme that Jacket.
That's my jacket!


235
00:23:46.908 --> 00:23:49.286
Hank!

236
00:23:52.623 --> 00:23:55.626
Hank! Help!

237
00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:01.423
Help! Help!

238
00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:09.139
Get back. Come on.
You leave him alone.


239
00:24:09.348 --> 00:24:13.852
Leave him alone.
Hey! Leave him alone.


240
00:24:18.982 --> 00:24:20.400
They almost killed me.

241
00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:22.611
You know you're
not supposed to run.


242
00:24:22.819 --> 00:24:25.739
My head knew it,
but my feet didn't.


243
00:24:29.076 --> 00:24:33.455
Oh. Hi babe. Oh.

244
00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:38.877
Put them out.

245
00:24:39.086 --> 00:24:41.171
They're trying to
stay away from Togar.


246
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.380
Come on.

247
00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.882
Why do they have to be in here?

248
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.443
Why this open door
policy you have here


249
00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:46.843
anyway with them?

250
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.138
All the doors are closed except
for here and the bathroom.


251
00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:52.641
There's nothing they can
tear up here or the bathroom.


252
00:24:52.849 --> 00:24:54.142
Put them out.

253
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:55.644
Mativo this is their home!

254
00:24:55.852 --> 00:24:57.038
What do you think
you're running?


255
00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.105
A country club for lions?

256
00:24:58.271 --> 00:24:59.439
Come on, sit down here.

257
00:25:06.613 --> 00:25:09.658
Sit down. You're okay. Oh.

258
00:25:14.788 --> 00:25:17.708
Sit down. You're okay, sit down.

259
00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:32.806
Hey no more fighting.

260
00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:34.683
Come here.

261
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.853
Aww. Sit down. You're okay.

262
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:38.729
Poor David You are okay.

263
00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.313
You are okay.

264
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.775
These stupid lions
are frightening me.


265
00:25:43.984 --> 00:25:44.735
And you want to bring Madelaine

266
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:46.236
and the children into this?

267
00:25:46.403 --> 00:25:48.822
This'll be great for 'em.

268
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.743
Not boxed in like
back in Chicago.


269
00:25:55.412 --> 00:25:57.998
Hey, wait a minute.

270
00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:34.242
I just thought he had
a cataract starting.


271
00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:37.162
That's Billy. He's great.

272
00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:42.834
They're right. You be on something.
I couldn't last a day.


273
00:26:43.043 --> 00:26:45.253
Expect her to sleep
with the lions are you?


274
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.591
What do you care if
I sleep with my wife?


275
00:26:57.599 --> 00:26:58.767
Mom, did you know that a man

276
00:26:58.975 --> 00:27:01.895
can have as many wives
as he wants to here?


277
00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:04.272
And what is that
supposed to mean?


278
00:27:04.481 --> 00:27:05.921
I mean how could
you be away from dad


279
00:27:05.982 --> 00:27:07.359
for so long?

280
00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:09.736
You know that your father
and I were having problems,


281
00:27:09.903 --> 00:27:11.964
and we thought it would be
better to be apart for a while.


282
00:27:11.988 --> 00:27:14.533
You know, absence makes
the heart grow fonder?


283
00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:15.968
The heart maybe, but what about

284
00:27:15.992 --> 00:27:18.036
the sex glands?

285
00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:20.497
Sex is all you think
about lately young lady.


286
00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.891
You'd better watch it,
or you're gonna get


287
00:27:21.915 --> 00:27:24.835
your little tail in trouble.

288
00:27:25.001 --> 00:27:26.721
Some day I hope you'll
understand the beauty


289
00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:28.421
of restraint and self-denial.

290
00:27:29.422 --> 00:27:31.675
Well I hope it wasn't
restraint and self-denial


291
00:27:31.842 --> 00:27:35.637
that drove dad away.

292
00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:40.100
- Hey Mativo.
- Yeah?


293
00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:41.452
You know what my kids used to do

294
00:27:41.476 --> 00:27:43.186
every time I started to sing?

295
00:27:43.353 --> 00:27:47.732
They'd hold their hands over
their ears and say, oh no.


296
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:50.026
Or they'd turn on the radio.

297
00:27:50.193 --> 00:27:53.989
Hey, hey, don't
let them in the boat.


298
00:27:54.197 --> 00:27:57.450
You're crazy.

299
00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:08.295
I think he said
it's just over the hill.


300
00:28:42.245 --> 00:28:45.498
I can't steer!

301
00:28:49.044 --> 00:28:52.339
I think we are sinking.

302
00:28:59.012 --> 00:29:02.223
Abandon ship!

303
00:29:06.895 --> 00:29:11.066
Hey Mativo. Hey Mativo,
climb out over that way.


304
00:29:22.285 --> 00:29:26.289
Don't swim, they'll get you.

305
00:29:37.384 --> 00:29:40.929
Mom, come here and look.

306
00:29:42.597 --> 00:29:45.850
It's fantastic.

307
00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:46.851
Dad?

308
00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.018
Dad.

309
00:29:48.144 --> 00:29:50.730
Hey dad.

310
00:30:03.493 --> 00:30:05.870
Dad?

311
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.333
Hank?

312
00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:20.010
Hello?

313
00:30:20.176 --> 00:30:21.302
Hank?

314
00:30:21.469 --> 00:30:23.638
Dad?

315
00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:26.933
We're here.

316
00:30:29.185 --> 00:30:31.688
Dad?

317
00:30:31.855 --> 00:30:36.526
Oh dear.

318
00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:39.821
Hey dad.

319
00:30:43.867 --> 00:30:44.868
Hank?

320
00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.836
This is really a nice place.

321
00:30:55.003 --> 00:30:59.507
Come on up.
This place is really wild.


322
00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:02.927
I'd give
anything for some sleep.


323
00:31:04.387 --> 00:31:07.515
I don't understand.

324
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:13.063
Is that a tarantula?

325
00:31:13.229 --> 00:31:16.941
Huh? You simple minded jerk!

326
00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:20.445
Stop that!

327
00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:41.174
Look.

328
00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:53.770
Oh my god.

329
00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.651
Where could he be?

330
00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:13.748
Jerry, run and
open all the windows.


331
00:32:13.957 --> 00:32:17.877
Then we'll dust everything
and surprise your father.


332
00:32:30.723 --> 00:32:33.101
Melanie?

333
00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:43.862
Hey a motorcycle.

334
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.905
I just saw a
thing. I think it was a pelican.


335
00:32:46.114 --> 00:32:48.908
It's a Kawasaki.

336
00:32:50.577 --> 00:32:54.497
Holy mackerel! Look at that!

337
00:32:55.915 --> 00:32:58.626
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

338
00:32:58.793 --> 00:33:00.003
Those can't be Dad's lions.

339
00:33:15.268 --> 00:33:19.731
Oh god. Look
what the cat dragged in.


340
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.740
Melanie?

341
00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:12.533
Mom.

342
00:34:12.742 --> 00:34:15.286
Get in here. Get in here.

343
00:34:19.082 --> 00:34:22.835
Jerry. John!

344
00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:44.899
Where's mom and Mel?

345
00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:46.818
They're downstairs. Come on.

346
00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:50.530
What is going on down there?

347
00:34:55.702 --> 00:34:57.704
Let's go down.

348
00:34:57.912 --> 00:34:59.289
Woah!

349
00:35:04.794 --> 00:35:06.796
Woah Uh!

350
00:35:11.259 --> 00:35:14.012
Go back.

351
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.518
Boy have we got troubles.

352
00:35:20.727 --> 00:35:21.807
Where'd they all come from?

353
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:29.401
Nice lion.

354
00:35:30.778 --> 00:35:32.739
Nice lion.

355
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.503
Oh no!

356
00:37:54.797 --> 00:37:57.884
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

357
00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:03.848
Help? Uhh.

358
00:38:21.282 --> 00:38:22.282
Woah!

359
00:39:22.843 --> 00:39:23.843
Melanie? Are you alright?

360
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:25.555
Yeah but I'm scared, Mom.

361
00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:28.349
Oh I know honey, so am I.

362
00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:57.545
Oh honey stay here.
I'll go get the boys.


363
00:39:59.046 --> 00:40:00.923
Hey. Hello.

364
00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:01.924
John?

365
00:40:02.091 --> 00:40:05.428
I'm in here.

366
00:40:28.242 --> 00:40:31.746
John are you alright?

367
00:40:34.624 --> 00:40:36.667
Where's Jerry?

368
00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.419
Help! Help!

369
00:40:38.586 --> 00:40:40.880
Jerry. Jerry?

370
00:40:41.088 --> 00:40:42.757
Oh god!

371
00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:49.555
Are you alright?

372
00:40:49.722 --> 00:40:51.265
You coulda suffocated!

373
00:40:51.432 --> 00:40:53.351
You coulda died dummy!

374
00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:55.770
Shut
up. I almost died.


375
00:40:55.978 --> 00:40:56.812
What kinda jerk

376
00:40:56.979 --> 00:40:59.774
would hide himself in an icebox?

377
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.734
Okay?

378
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:04.362
Yeah.

379
00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:10.159
Get me outta here!

380
00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:14.789
Help! Mom! John! Jerry!

381
00:41:16.832 --> 00:41:18.959
In here.

382
00:41:20.169 --> 00:41:21.169
Jerry hurry.

383
00:41:21.337 --> 00:41:22.546
Right here!

384
00:41:22.755 --> 00:41:24.340
Come on.
One, two, three.


385
00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.016
Maybe there's some
guns 'round here.


386
00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.518
We gotta find a gun.

387
00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:37.770
I think we ought
to split while we can.


388
00:41:37.978 --> 00:41:41.232
Yeah sure with 8,000
lions and tigers outside.


389
00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:43.776
Well if we stay here, we'll
end up being eaten alive.


390
00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:45.486
We're not gonna get eaten.

391
00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:47.775
When Dad gets here, he'll
show us how to handle them.


392
00:41:47.822 --> 00:41:49.740
Until then, we'll just
board up the windows.


393
00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:51.200
Wait a minute.
Who voted you in?


394
00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:53.452
I did. I suppose you
wanna make a run for it?


395
00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:55.830
Right on. I'll take the
motorcycle and go get help.


396
00:41:56.038 --> 00:41:57.918
I know bikes, and I know
the road we came in on.


397
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.167
That's not gonna help;
that's letting you escape,


398
00:42:00.334 --> 00:42:01.794
and leaving us here.

399
00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:47.817
- John! Shoot 'em!
- No!


400
00:43:51.987 --> 00:43:53.989
- John! Shoot 'em!
- No!


401
00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:30.067
Give me your handkerchief John.

402
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.579
I wanna go home.

403
00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.163
Madelaine's gonna kill me.

404
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.082
It'll go much faster
if you go up there


405
00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.667
and borrow some bicycles.

406
00:44:46.834 --> 00:44:47.835
Okay.

407
00:44:48.043 --> 00:44:48.752
I'll take the tigers.

408
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.272
I'll go 'round back
of the village.


409
00:44:50.296 --> 00:44:51.338
Good move.

410
00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:31.128
Don't tell
me, he said, you said.


411
00:45:31.337 --> 00:45:32.922
I'm not interested
in your bickering.


412
00:45:33.088 --> 00:45:34.590
Who asked you to go over there?

413
00:45:34.757 --> 00:45:36.592
I can go on
any property to kill animals


414
00:45:36.759 --> 00:45:39.261
that I deem are a
danger to human lives.


415
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.639
Don't tell me
you care about his family.


416
00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:44.475
I'm telling you there'll be
no culling of cats, elephants,


417
00:45:44.683 --> 00:45:46.435
or any animals ever again.

418
00:45:46.602 --> 00:45:48.038
Well you should
have been at his madhouse


419
00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:49.688
and seen those
cats this morning.


420
00:45:49.855 --> 00:45:51.273
I don't care what you say.

421
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.026
You are not going to go out
there and slaughter his animals.


422
00:45:54.234 --> 00:45:55.794
We cull elephants
if there are too many.


423
00:45:55.945 --> 00:45:58.572
Prentiss, you're
completely out of line.


424
00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:01.200
You are not going
to kill those cats.


425
00:46:01.408 --> 00:46:02.910
You can tell me
what you're gonna do.


426
00:46:03.077 --> 00:46:04.220
And you can tell
me what the rest of


427
00:46:04.244 --> 00:46:07.456
this committee's gonna do, Rick.

428
00:46:07.665 --> 00:46:09.625
But I'll be damned if
you're gonna tell me


429
00:46:09.792 --> 00:46:12.878
what I'm gonna do.

430
00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:19.051
We can't store two tigers.

431
00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:21.178
Well I tried
to make them go home.


432
00:46:21.387 --> 00:46:22.096
How come they are not doing

433
00:46:22.304 --> 00:46:23.347
what you are telling them.

434
00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:24.223
Well they're not trained pets.

435
00:46:24.431 --> 00:46:26.266
They're just friends.

436
00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:31.772
Stay off my back.

437
00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:37.486
Come on. Where are you going?

438
00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:39.530
Come on down.

439
00:46:39.738 --> 00:46:41.824
You go. I'm not going.

440
00:46:41.991 --> 00:46:43.117
You know, you're right.

441
00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:44.702
I can't go to the
airport with them.


442
00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.704
They'll go right in with me.

443
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.039
Hey I got an idea for ya.

444
00:46:49.248 --> 00:46:50.541
Hang down off that branch.

445
00:46:50.749 --> 00:46:51.542
- Huh?
- Let your feet


446
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:52.751
hang down here.

447
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.752
- What?
- Kick your feet.


448
00:46:53.961 --> 00:46:54.753
They'll jump right
up and try to getcha.


449
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.462
Then they'll stay here.

450
00:46:55.671 --> 00:46:56.380
I can sneak away.

451
00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.924
No, no. I'm not doing that.

452
00:46:59.133 --> 00:47:01.719
- Listen.
- Uh huh?


453
00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:03.762
Take your shirt off, okay?

454
00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:05.973
And dangle it down.

455
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:09.768
Hold it by the sleeve.

456
00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:16.066
There you go.

457
00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:30.873
Hurry back!

458
00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.342
Why did you bring us here.

459
00:48:23.509 --> 00:48:25.010
We're just gonna die.

460
00:48:25.177 --> 00:48:26.637
No we are not going to die.

461
00:48:28.013 --> 00:48:28.597
Your father is going
to be here soon.


462
00:48:28.764 --> 00:48:29.764
And it'll be all over.

463
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.809
Well why isn't he here now?

464
00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:34.853
He knew we were coming!

465
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.232
You can belly-ache all you
want about him staying away.


466
00:48:38.398 --> 00:48:41.276
But if he's not here
it's because he's dead.


467
00:48:41.443 --> 00:48:45.072
And he's not coming. I know it.

468
00:49:10.973 --> 00:49:11.991
Boy I've been ready to do this

469
00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:14.017
for a long time.

470
00:49:14.226 --> 00:49:16.770
Don't you think we should wait?

471
00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.648
We shouldn't load
anything smaller


472
00:49:19.815 --> 00:49:22.818
than a .30-06 for a lion.

473
00:50:01.815 --> 00:50:02.815
Lenny?

474
00:50:04.985 --> 00:50:07.779
Aw Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.

475
00:50:07.988 --> 00:50:09.072
Okay.

476
00:50:13.327 --> 00:50:15.621
Okay, okay.

477
00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.328
Come on. Put your
bike in the trunk.


478
00:50:56.495 --> 00:50:57.815
They must be in
the house already.


479
00:50:57.871 --> 00:50:59.831
They took the bus yesterday.

480
00:50:59.998 --> 00:51:00.998
Nikki, get in the car.

481
00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.793
Come on. Get in the back.

482
00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:04.161
Come on Greg, get in with us.

483
00:51:04.336 --> 00:51:05.754
Come on Greg.

484
00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:07.339
That's a good boy.

485
00:51:07.547 --> 00:51:08.382
That's a good boy.

486
00:51:08.548 --> 00:51:11.301
Turn around.

487
00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:22.104
He is trying to
close me in the trunk!


488
00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:24.982
Hey come on, get in.

489
00:51:29.903 --> 00:51:33.657
Hey, well come on. Get in.

490
00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.784
Crazy. With them in the back?

491
00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:37.077
They'll bite my head off.

492
00:51:37.286 --> 00:51:39.204
Either get in or
walk, 'cause I'm goin'.


493
00:51:39.413 --> 00:51:41.790
Make them walk.

494
00:51:41.957 --> 00:51:43.458
This is madness.

495
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:45.502
If somebody sees them
this far from my place


496
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:47.337
They'll shoot 'em.

497
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:51.842
These are your friends huh?

498
00:51:52.009 --> 00:51:53.289
And do you know
what your friends


499
00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:55.846
are probably doing to
your family right now?


500
00:51:56.054 --> 00:51:58.015
They are making dinner of them.

501
00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:00.350
They are eating them.

502
00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:01.727
Tivo, shut up.

503
00:52:01.893 --> 00:52:03.353
They are sitting
around eating them,


504
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.730
cracking their bones.

505
00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:05.896
Shut up.

506
00:52:05.981 --> 00:52:07.292
They are licking
their bones clean.


507
00:52:07.316 --> 00:52:10.527
Shut up!

508
00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:11.737
Who are you?

509
00:52:11.903 --> 00:52:15.741
Come on.

510
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:44.102
Hey! Don't go so fast.

511
00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:45.604
It's too bumpy.

512
00:52:45.812 --> 00:52:49.483
I have to Mativo.

513
00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.949
By the way, do they know

514
00:52:58.116 --> 00:53:00.243
that they should not run?

515
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.690
You should have sent them a list

516
00:53:01.828 --> 00:53:05.582
of rules and regulations
before they came.


517
00:53:14.716 --> 00:53:18.804
Aw. Poor Leonard.

518
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:14.336
Let's get out of here.

519
00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:15.544
Only Melanie was right.

520
00:55:15.587 --> 00:55:18.924
Let's go take the boat.

521
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:34.731
Jerry okay, you go
first. Go ahead.


522
00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.118
Woah. Melanie.

523
00:55:47.327 --> 00:55:48.578
Oh there's a tiger!

524
00:56:13.853 --> 00:56:16.064
Faster!

525
00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:33.790
Go John!

526
00:56:42.841 --> 00:56:44.342
John. John!

527
00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.516
John, jump out!

528
00:57:05.614 --> 00:57:08.950
Jerry! You're going
the wrong way!


529
00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:21.004
Go John! Go!

530
00:57:31.431 --> 00:57:33.433
Melanie get in the boat.

531
00:57:45.654 --> 00:57:46.821
Going right into shore.

532
00:57:46.988 --> 00:57:48.114
Jerry watch out.

533
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.085
Go back this way.

534
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:02.462
Come on, sport.

535
00:58:09.636 --> 00:58:12.514
Boy that was close.

536
00:58:21.356 --> 00:58:23.525
Get away!

537
00:58:23.692 --> 00:58:24.692
Get away from me!

538
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.295
Put her down!

539
00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:27.714
Help me! Help me!

540
00:59:27.922 --> 00:59:29.340
Let go of her!

541
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:36.765
Help! Help! Help!

542
00:59:43.688 --> 00:59:46.483
Help me!

543
01:00:38.743 --> 01:00:42.080
Aw less then ten
miles to go and we're stuck.


544
01:00:42.288 --> 01:00:43.288
What's wrong?

545
01:00:43.414 --> 01:00:44.683
The jack won't work in the sand.

546
01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:46.352
And the more I dig, the
more the car slides.


547
01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.502
I'll have to run.

548
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.420
But you know you're
not supposed to run.


549
01:00:49.629 --> 01:00:50.989
You hold the tigers
back, would ya?


550
01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.590
- So they don't tackle me.
- What?


551
01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.092
Just use this. Use this.

552
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.804
Use this. Go like that.

553
01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:25.790
Hey Prentiss, did you see that?

554
01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:28.209
Got 'em right through the neck.

555
01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:29.645
- Sooner or later--
- If we're not--


556
01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:30.336
the lions are gonna get us.

557
01:01:30.545 --> 01:01:31.838
he'll be back.

558
01:01:32.046 --> 01:01:33.065
- I'm gonna go for help.
- Why stay here?


559
01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:33.673
Now let's make sure
that all the other doors


560
01:01:33.882 --> 01:01:34.883
in the house are secure.

561
01:01:35.049 --> 01:01:36.801
I hate this place here!

562
01:01:36.968 --> 01:01:38.803
I don't think there's
a good decision.


563
01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.067
- John?
- Hey!


564
01:01:53.234 --> 01:01:54.861
I'm gonna get help!

565
01:01:55.028 --> 01:01:56.070
And leave us here?

566
01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.572
I'm gonna get help.

567
01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.657
I thought it was suicide!

568
01:01:59.824 --> 01:02:00.824
Good luck, son.

569
01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.721
Oh no!

570
01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:52.603
Ow. Get out of here.

571
01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:59.277
Open the door. Come on.

572
01:03:59.485 --> 01:04:01.738
Go on. Get out of
here. Leave it!


573
01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:04.824
Go on. Leave it.

574
01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.999
Jerry open the door. Come on.

575
01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:16.419
You think I'm crazy?

576
01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:57.793
What kind of jerk

577
01:04:57.835 --> 01:04:59.962
would go off the
roof on a motorcycle?


578
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:03.716
Get off of her!

579
01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:13.518
Ugh heavy.

580
01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:19.816
No!

581
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:30.868
Melanie. John, Jerry!

582
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:32.661
Where are you?

583
01:05:32.745 --> 01:05:36.624
John! Jerry! Hurry!

584
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:40.837
Melanie! Get up.

585
01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:45.091
No no no!

586
01:05:45.258 --> 01:05:47.343
What's wrong?

587
01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:50.680
Hey what are
you doin' on the floor?


588
01:05:53.474 --> 01:05:57.728
John I can't get my
leg out! Ow ow ow ow!


589
01:05:57.937 --> 01:05:59.605
Come on, hurry.
Get out. I'll hold 'em.


590
01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:03.109
I'll hold 'em.

591
01:06:03.276 --> 01:06:06.737
Melanie come here.

592
01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.416
Oh.
Oh my goodness.


593
01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:21.085
Jerry help your sister.

594
01:06:21.294 --> 01:06:22.879
He's just tryin' to kiss her.

595
01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.798
Still trying to open the door.

596
01:06:52.491 --> 01:06:55.286
You think
we have enough ammunition?


597
01:06:55.453 --> 01:06:56.746
I've got twenty in this belt,

598
01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:58.831
and thirty in the other.

599
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.335
Remember where all the cheetahs,
leopards, and tigers drop.


600
01:07:02.543 --> 01:07:05.129
We skin them on the way back.

601
01:07:05.296 --> 01:07:09.842
The lions are worthless.
Leave them for the hyenas.


602
01:07:41.832 --> 01:07:46.671
No! Get away.
Go on! Go on! Go!


603
01:11:47.995 --> 01:11:49.663
No!

604
01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.666
Come on!

605
01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:52.560
Hey mom, up on the roof!

606
01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:59.608
Mom go over the track!

607
01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:36.562
Come on mom.

608
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.108
See ma? It's another
house. It's completely safe.


609
01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:42.317
It's a good thing,

610
01:13:42.443 --> 01:13:44.862
because I can't
walk another step.


611
01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.530
I'm so tired my legs

612
01:13:46.697 --> 01:13:47.865
are gonna buckle under me.

613
01:13:48.073 --> 01:13:50.951
I just have to
sleep for a while.


614
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:55.766
Oh Donnie Lion!

615
01:14:58.602 --> 01:15:01.855
Come on my friend. Get up.

616
01:15:02.022 --> 01:15:05.025
Let's run again.

617
01:17:57.865 --> 01:18:02.578
Togar! Hey! Ahh!

618
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.517
Togar not that way!

619
01:18:25.726 --> 01:18:29.771
Oh you poor stupid jerks.

620
01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.399
Togar not that way!

621
01:19:18.904 --> 01:19:21.782
Let's try to get 'em outside.

622
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.790
I don't think they're
tryin' to hurt us at all.


623
01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:33.502
Come on. Come on lion.

624
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:36.797
Come
on lion. Come on.


625
01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.221
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, faster.


626
01:20:01.989 --> 01:20:04.157
Come on.

627
01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:08.870
Melanie, John,
get away from those lions.


628
01:20:09.079 --> 01:20:10.831
Mom, if they wanted to get us,

629
01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.250
they would have done it
while we were asleep.


630
01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:14.584
Come on.

631
01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.084
Are you sure it's alright?

632
01:20:20.007 --> 01:20:20.716
Make sure
the mother isn't around.


633
01:20:20.924 --> 01:20:22.259
They're cute.

634
01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:32.477
Oh look at!

635
01:20:39.776 --> 01:20:43.739
You're really friendly.

636
01:20:43.947 --> 01:20:48.326
Oh she's beautiful, isn't she?

637
01:21:07.804 --> 01:21:11.183
John.

638
01:21:16.730 --> 01:21:17.856
Oh look at.

639
01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:30.535
You're really friendly.

640
01:21:30.744 --> 01:21:33.455
Oh she's beautiful isn't she?

641
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:39.669
Togar! Togar! Togar!

642
01:21:39.836 --> 01:21:44.216
Madelaine!

643
01:22:03.026 --> 01:22:07.405
John.

644
01:22:07.614 --> 01:22:08.614
Hello lion.

645
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.111
Togar! Togar!

646
01:22:46.319 --> 01:22:50.699
Togar! Togar! Madelaine!

647
01:23:08.341 --> 01:23:09.718
Oh hello lions.

648
01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:14.222
Yeah you guys stay
away from Robbie.


649
01:23:32.324 --> 01:23:35.327
Hey kids how are ya?

650
01:23:37.704 --> 01:23:40.790
Oh oh. Woah!

651
01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:51.801
I better go help your ma.

652
01:23:56.556 --> 01:23:59.851
Hey Lynn, get off.
Come on, get up.


653
01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:01.519
Don't hit her Jerry, hug her.

654
01:24:01.686 --> 01:24:04.272
She wants you to hold her.

655
01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:07.484
Are you okay?

656
01:24:07.692 --> 01:24:09.903
I'm just so happy you're here.

657
01:24:14.074 --> 01:24:16.660
You're okay. Don't worry.

658
01:24:16.826 --> 01:24:17.826
Don't worry?

659
01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.710
Look at her.

660
01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:30.465
Oh I sure love ya.

661
01:24:30.674 --> 01:24:34.803
Oh I love you too.

662
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.973
Hey. Come on.

663
01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:41.017
Go away. Get away.

664
01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:45.897
Hi little gal.

665
01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.869
Listen, don't say anything
about Prentiss, okay?


666
01:25:00.036 --> 01:25:01.413
But he was killing your lions.

667
01:25:01.579 --> 01:25:03.266
I don't want you to say
anything about that either.


668
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:05.458
Don't spoil the reunion.
I'll tell them later.


669
01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.669
Listen I want you
to meet my family.


670
01:25:07.877 --> 01:25:08.917
This is my wife Madelaine.

671
01:25:09.087 --> 01:25:10.167
- Hello Madelaine.
- Mativo.


672
01:25:10.255 --> 01:25:11.298
This is my son, John.

673
01:25:11.464 --> 01:25:12.507
Hello how are you?

674
01:25:12.716 --> 01:25:13.425
Hello, nice to meet you.

675
01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:14.259
This is my daughter, Melanie.

676
01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:15.468
Melanie, Mativo.

677
01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:16.261
- Melanie, how are you?
- Hello.


678
01:25:16.428 --> 01:25:17.428
My son Jerry.

679
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:18.555
Jerry huh.

680
01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:20.241
Come on this way. I
have a surprise for you.


681
01:25:20.265 --> 01:25:21.808
Boy are we glad to see you.

682
01:25:21.975 --> 01:25:23.685
What are y'all
doin' wearin' my clothes?


683
01:25:27.272 --> 01:25:30.775
Oh no. What happened?

684
01:25:30.984 --> 01:25:32.144
Jerry, get back. Form a line.

685
01:25:32.444 --> 01:25:33.820
They all want to meet you.

686
01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:35.029
We've already met 'em.

687
01:25:39.034 --> 01:25:41.619
Isn't this fantastic?

688
01:25:41.786 --> 01:25:42.579
What do you think?

689
01:25:42.787 --> 01:25:43.621
You guys gonna stay a while?

690
01:25:43.788 --> 01:25:44.914
Sure dad.

691
01:25:45.081 --> 01:25:47.041
I don't have to be back
to Chicago 'til next week.
